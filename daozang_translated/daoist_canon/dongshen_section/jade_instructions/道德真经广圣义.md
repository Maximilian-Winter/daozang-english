**Volume One of the *Dao De Zheng Jing Guang Sheng Yi***
**Narrated by Tang Master Guang Cheng (Du Guangting)**
**Preface Explaining the Grand Meaning of the Scripture**

Now, I shall elucidate this scripture in two major parts: first, clarifying the composition of the commentary, and then expounding upon the original text itself. Today, I initially recount the origins of this commentary.

In the past, the Great Tang Emperor Xuanzong (玄宗皇帝), during his moments of leisure, pondered the wondrous gates of the Dao, considering the Great Way as the primordial root of heaven and earth. Laozi (老君) is the Supreme Ancestor of Primordial Mystery. Through the two scriptures (*Daodejing* and *Zhuangzi*), his teachings unfolded over countless years, tracing back to the reign of Shun (舜朝) and transmitted through the Zhou dynasty (周代). Over sixty commentaries and elucidations have been penned, interpreting its principles.

For matters of governance and statecraft, the strictures of **Yan Shi** (严氏) and **He Gong Yang Jiao** (河公杨镳) were self-realized. In terms of cultivating personal virtue, the teachings of **Song Ling** (松灵) and **Xiang Er Yi** (想尔逸) were profound, their paths difficult to follow.

Among these, in the Southern dynasties (南朝), the luminaries **Emperor Wu of Liang** (梁武), **Emperor Jianwen of Liang** (简文), **Seng Zhao** (僧肇), **Luoshitong** (罗什), **Zang** (臧), **Tao** (陶), **Gu** (顾), and **Meng** (孟) were esteemed. Meanwhile, **Ren** (任), **Li** (黎), and **the two Zhangs** (二张) shone like stars across **Western Shu** (西蜀). Yet, despite their contributions, the commentaries diverged in quality—some were flawed, others incomplete—and none fully penetrated the depths of its hallowed teachings. Who could truly fathom its profound mysteries?

In the **Kaiyuan** (开元) year **11**, I personally undertook this commentary. The Emperor decreed:

*"In ancient times, the Primordial Sage forcefully expounded upon the Mysterious Words."*

**Explication:** The term *zhao* (诏) is a royal edict. For the Son of Heaven (天子), it is called *zhao*, *gao*, *chi*, or *zhi*; for the Empress, Crown Prince, and nobles, it is called *jiao* (教) or *ling* (令)—all terms signifying the sovereign’s command descending upon his subjects or superiors unto inferiors.

The term *yue* (曰) is said to be from the mouth, representing speech or utterance, as in opening one’s mouth and extending the tongue to speak. The *Shuo Wen* (Explanation of Script) states: *"Yue (曰) is discourse. It is composed of the radical 'mouth' (口) and the phonetic 'yi' (乙), symbolizing the breath issuing from the mouth and forming articulate speech."* Hence, it is called *yue*.

*"In ancient times"* (昔者) means "in the past."
*"Zai"* (在) means "to exist."
*"Yuan"* (元) means "the beginning."
*"Sheng"* (圣) denotes the virtue of "enlightened penetration" (灵通之德). As the *Book of Documents* (书) states: *"Rui (睿) creates Sheng (圣)."*
*"Qiang"* (强) means "to exert force."
*"Zhuo"* (着) means "to compose or write."
*"Xuan"* (玄) signifies "profound and subtle."
*"Yan"* (言) is "discourse."

Laozi is the origin of Daoist transformation, the utmost virtue of the Primordial Sage. He expounded upon the ineffable, nameless Way, crafting forceful and resonant words to revive and propagate the Mysterious Teachings, guiding all generations. His understanding was profound, hence the term *"Xuan Yan"* (玄言, Mysterious Words). As the first among all sages, he is called the *"Yuan Sheng"* (元圣, Primordial Sage).

The Emperor decreed:
*"Establish the True Doctrine as the foundation,"*
**Explication:** *"Quan Yu"* (权舆) means "the beginning." *"Zhen"* (真) signifies "pure and unadulterated." *"Zong"* (宗) is "to honor." Thus, the decree establishes the *Daodejing* as the foundational, pure, and honored doctrine.

The Emperor decreed:
*"Illuminate and guide the future generations."*
**Explication:** *"Qi"* (启) means "to open." *"Di"* (迪) means "to advance." *"Tong"* (通) means "to reach." *"Lai"* (来) refers to "the future." *"Yi"* (裔) means "heirs" or "boundaries." This decree signifies that the two chapters of the *Daodejing* endure through all ages, serving as a model for future rulers and broadly transforming both humanity and the heavens, eternally disseminating its profound mysteries.

The Emperor decreed:
*"Though his writings remain, the refined meaning has strayed."*
**Explication:** *"Yi"* (遗) means "to leave behind." Laozi, having completed his Mysterious Transformation, ascended to the **Nine Pure** (九清), leaving behind the True Scripture for all ages. The sages and kings of every era revere it, and it persists through the ages. *"Cheng"* (诚) means "truthful," denoting an unalterable standard. *"Jing"* (精) signifies "pure, refined, and profound." *"Yi"* (义) refers to the principles and meanings of the scripture. *"Po"* (颇) means "extremely." *"Kui"* (乖) means "to deviate." Thus, though the scripture’s profound and pure principles remain, the world has yet to fully exhaust their depths. Even with sixty commentaries, the refined meaning still strays far from its original intent—referring to the following sentence.

The Emperor decreed:
*"Though I condense its essence, even Shu Yan’s work is still deficient."*
**Explication:** *"Cuo"* (撮) means "to select and compile." *"Zhi"* (指) means "direction or intent." *"Gui"* (归) means "the convergence of principles." Shu Yan (蜀严), the Daoist adept **Yan Junping** (严君平), resided in Shu (蜀) and authored the *Dao De Zhi Gui* (指归, *The Direction and Convergence of the Dao De*), a work of fourteen volumes, expansive and vast, highly praised in his time. In the Han dynasty (汉朝), the eminent scholar **Yang Ziyun** (杨子云) of Shu declared: *"Shu Yan’s understanding of the Dao De is profound and abstruse."* His insight was deep, his Mysterious Virtue concealed, far beyond the comprehension of the common folk. Yet, even his work is still deficient.

At that time, it was believed that the teachings of the *Dao De* were confined to five thousand characters in the text, yet the interpretations of its principles and intent could reach tens of thousands. When applied to the world, they were deemed abundant and expansive; when reasoned through, they were criticized for their sprawling and excessive proliferation.

Hence, it was said: *"Though Shu Yan’s work is profound, it still falls short."*

The Emperor decreed:
*"Select its key passages, and even River Master’s exposition is still deficient."*

**Explication:** *"Select"* (摘) refers to choosing and distinguishing. *"Passages"* (章) means to measure and judge the words and tones. *"Sentence"* (句) is where speech naturally pauses. *"From"* (自) means *"since"* or *"beginning with."* River Master (河公) is **River Master** (河上公), a Daoist sage of the **Taiji** (太极) lineage, **Ge Xuan** (葛玄), who authored *The Preface and Essentials of the Dao De Jing* (《道德经序诀》). It was recorded that River Master’s true name was unknown. During the reign of **Emperor Wen of Han** (汉孝文皇帝), he constructed a thatched hut by the riverbank, where he habitually studied the *Dao De Jing* of Laozi. Today, in the vicinity of the **Yellow River in Shaanxi** (今陕州黄河之侧), there stands a temple dedicated to River Master. To the left of the path, there remains the **Wanxian Platform** (望仙台) of Emperor Wen of Han. Since people of that time did not know his name, they often saw him engaged in the craft of sandal-making, dwelling by the river, hence the title **River Master**.

*"Even River Master’s exposition is still deficient"* (而犹病耳): The Imperial decree held that the *Dao De Jing*, being the most revered scripture encompassing all teachings, governs the Three Realms (三才), the foundation of statecraft and family governance, and the essence of self-cultivation and Daoist practice—omnipotent and all-encompassing. Yet River Master divided it into **eighty-one chapters**, constrained by the **nine-nine** (九九) numerical scheme, which failed to capture the boundless, effortless profundity of the Sage. Hence, it was said: *"Though beginning with River Master, the exposition is still deficient."*

The Emperor decreed:
*"The rest are merely subtle and obscure, not worth counting."*

**Explication:** *"The rest"* (其余) refers to the interpretations of the over fifty schools beyond Shu Yan and River Master. *"Subtle"* (浸微) means distant and refined. *"Obscure"* (微细) means minute and trivial. *"Count"* (数) means to enumerate or calculate. Though Shu Yan’s work still falls short, it suffices for discussion on the **Heavy Mysterious** (重玄). Though River Master’s exposition is deficient, it still illuminates the utmost subtlety. The interpretations of the other schools are distant, refined, and trivial, unworthy of comparison—indeed, they are not within the scope of the Imperial decree’s enumeration.

The Emperor decreed:
*"Then my profound and wondrous essence of the Dao—how could it ever be lost?"*

**Explication:** *"My"* (我) is the Emperor’s self-reference. *"Profound and wondrous essence"* (玄元妙旨) pertains to the profound and wondrous intent of the **Two Scriptures** (二经). The Imperial decree lamented the hidden profundity of the *Dao De* text and the subtle, ineffable essence of its upper and lower teachings, which had yet to be fully illuminated. Those who interpreted it after Shu Yan and River Master, with their commentaries and annotations, grew ever more distant from the Sage’s original intent, their elucidations of the Dao ever more obscure. How could such a vital teaching ever be abandoned, buried, or fail to flourish for generations to come?

The Emperor decreed:
*"I am indeed limited in virtue and shallow in understanding; I often feel the weight of this grand tradition, fearing I may lose the principle of the Effortless Dao."*

**Explication:** *"I"* (朕) is the Emperor’s self-reference, a convention established since **Emperor Qin Shihuang** (秦始皇) adopted the term for the sovereign. *"Limited"* (寡) means the Dao is not yet widely spread. *"Shallow"* (薄) means my virtue is not yet abundant—this is the language of self-deprecation by the Imperial decree.

Every time I reverently contemplate this scripture, I fear its profound truths may be suppressed and lost, failing to enlighten all people. Yet I inherit the Sage’s hidden Dao, occupying the supreme position among ten thousand households—how could I allow the Effortless Way’s teachings to stagnate and not flow freely, or let the Dao’s instructions grow dim and remain unseen?

*"Having successors"* refers to how the Venerable Lord’s blessings descended, illuminating the Sacred Tang Dynasty.

Moreover, even the sons of archers and smiths do not lose their noble lineage, while humble woodcutters may still fear neglecting their duties. How much more so for one whose virtue shines like Yao and Yu, whose sacred writings surpass the ancients?

I must surely refine and perfect this most profound work, ensuring its brilliance endures through the ages.

**The Emperor decreed:**
*"Whenever I hold a solemn banquet, I invariably ponder the Mysterious Pass, and whatever insights arise, I record them as annotations. This is not to establish a single school of thought, but to supplement what may have been overlooked in prior commentaries."*

**Explication:**
*"The Emperor, in moments free from state affairs, delves deeply into the Mysterious Pass, seeking silence for its resonance, exploring ultimate truths and profound mysteries to align with the subtle and elusive principles. The sacred text elucidates the empty and tranquil passages, derived from divine intuition, harmonizing with ancestral teachings. 'Annotations' (笺) mean 'tablets,' 'explanations,' and 'commentaries.' Out of humility, I do not wish to emulate Lü Buwei or Confucius in crafting a singular interpretation, but merely to address the unresolved meanings left by others."*

**The Emperor decreed:**
*"Now, I cease my pen, deferring instead to the collective wisdom of ministers, officials, and the Daoist and Buddhist communities."*

**Explication:**
*"Ceasing the pen" means the text’s arrangement is complete, its teachings fully articulated—setting down the brush and ending the writing. Just as Confucius, returning from Wei to Lu, entrusted the Ru historians to compile the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, covering the twelve rulers from Duke Huan to Duke Ai (242 years), until Duke Ai’s fourteenth year (501 BCE), when, during a spring hunt in the Great Wilds, the carriage of the Zongsun clan struck a qilin. Deeming it an omen, he ordered it buried and given to the park keepers."*

**The Master observed and said:**
*"It is a qilin—only then should it be taken.*
*The qilin and phoenix are among the Five Auspicious Spirits, omens of the Sage-King’s virtue.
*Now the qilin appears untimely, its response unfulfilled, its destiny lost—
*this is why the Sage is moved.
*The cessation of the pen at the mention of the qilin arises from this very sentiment,
*and is thus the fitting conclusion.

*Now that the commentary is complete,
*I issue this decree to promulgate the Sage’s work,
*seeking wisdom from all worthy scholars.
*The meaning of ‘ceasing the pen’ remains the same,
*yet unlike before, it is not born of lamentation,
*but rather to demonstrate the Sage’s virtue in humility—
*consulting the princes, ministers, and assistants,
*extending even to the Daoist and Buddhist traditions,
*seeking out those of broad learning and discernment,
*awaiting further elucidation of profound principles.*

**The Emperor decrees:**
*'Let those who can awaken my understanding as Bo Shang did with his mastery of poetry,
*or as Zuo Qiuming did in clarifying the *Spring and Autumn*—
*should they fulfill this expectation,
*they shall be richly rewarded.*

**Explication:**
*Bo Shang, styled Zixia, was a disciple of Confucius.
*In the *Analects* (Book of *Eight Augments*), it is recorded:
*Zixia asked the Master:
*‘Graceful smile, lovely eyes—
*why is white used to adorn it?’
*The Master replied:
*‘First the colors are applied, then the white.’
*Zixia then asked:
*‘Is it the same with ritual?’
*The scholars’ commentaries state that the first two lines appear in the *Odes* (*Wei Wind: The Stately Woman*), Chapter Two—
*a poem lamenting Min’s wife, Lady Jiang.
*The third line is lost.
*It compares Lady Jiang’s radiant beauty with her adherence to ritual,
*as in embroidery or painting—
*first the colors are arranged, then the white is used to define them,
*making each detail distinct.
*‘Embroidery’ refers to the finished design of silk, ‘painting’ to the finished design of ink.
*The Master rejoiced that Zixia, upon hearing ‘first the colors, then the white,’
*understood that beauty must be tempered by ritual.
*Thus he said:
*‘Gifted in awakening my words on poetry!’
*Now he may truly discuss the *Odes* with me.’

*Zuo Qiuming was Zuo Qiu, the author of the *Zuozhuan*.
*The Master composed the *Spring and Autumn*,
*and Qiuming transmitted it.
*Where the text was unclear, Qiuming corrected it—
*sometimes prefiguring the events, sometimes concluding their meaning.
*The *Spring and Autumn* benefited from Qiuming as a physician cures illness.
*The Emperor’s decree now awaits the gathering of talents,
*to fully expound the profound principles,
*as Confucius did with Zixia,
*or as the *Spring and Autumn* relied on Qiuming—
*welcoming frank speech, valuing only the virtuous,
*with an open heart and generous rewards.
*This shows the utmost sincerity in adopting good counsel,
*and in repaying merit with honor.*

**The Emperor decrees:**
*'As for flatterers who claim their own sageliness,
*this is not their kind.*

**Explication:**
*The flatterer who claims his own sageliness is found in the *Book of Documents* (*Yugong*):
*‘The servant praises his lord, saying, “He is a sage.”’
*When the worthy are in office, there are no flatterers.
*With the brilliant and enlightened ruling,
*how could there be such folly?
*This is not their way.*

**The Emperor decrees:**
*'Those who boast like Lü Buwei, hanging their works in the marketplace,
*are but petty schemes.
*Since I do not conceal my intent,
*all may speak freely.*

**Explication:**
*Lü Buwei, as Qin Chancellor, was granted a marquisate of ten thousand households,
*his prestige unmatched in the land.
*He gathered scholars to compile a text,
*which, upon completion, he hung in the marketplace with this proclamation:
*‘Whoever alters a single word shall receive a thousand pieces of gold.’
*It was titled the *Lüshi Chunqiu*,
*and he greatly boasted of it in his time.
*Now that the commentary is finished,
*I seek out the talented,
*opening the path for direct speech,
*and granting the grace of candor.
*Thus, the boasting of Lü Buwei is truly a petty affair.
*Later, he fell into disgrace under the First Emperor and was exiled to Shu.*

**The Emperor decrees:**
*'Let none mock my shortcomings,
*lest they weigh upon my lack of virtue.*

**Explication:**
*‘Lack of virtue’ refers to failing in the Way of *wuwei* (non-action).
*The profound teachings are now fully expounded,
*yet I still invite further discourse and reward those who contribute.
*Thus, within the nine boundaries and beyond the eight extremes,
*who would not revere the Sage’s enlightenment
*and align with the Supreme Dao?"*

**The text continues:**

*«In the following year, the Emperor then inscribed the Four Stone Stele Commentary on the Daoist Canon,*
*and erected them at the Left Street Xingtang Observatory and the Right Street Jinxian Observatory.*
*Additionally, the governors and prefects of all the prefectures*
*each established stone platforms at the auspicious sites of their respective Longxing and Kaiyuan Observatories,*
*to ensure its enduring transmission.*

*Furthermore, he sought out and composed this Explication,*
*and proclaimed it throughout the world.*

**The Imperial Edict states:**
*'The Five Thousand Daoist Teachings*
*are truly the foundation of familial instruction.*
*To govern the state, they bring forth the Way of enduring peace and prosperity,*
*and to cultivate the self, they accord with the path of eternal life.*
*They encompass all dharmas without distinction,*
*and surpass the Six Classics, standing as the foremost.*

*It is fitting to elevate *The Daoist Teachings of Virtue and Power* above the Nine Classics,*
*and place it above *The Zhou Yi* [Book of Changes].*
*Let *The Daoist Teachings*, *The Zhou Yi*, and *The Zhuangzi* be considered the Three Profound Studies,*
*and further, let *The Zhuangzi* be known as *The True Dao of Nan Hua*,
*let *The Wenzzi* be known as *The True Dao of Communion*,
*let *The Lizi* be known as *The True Dao of the Void*,
*and let *The Gengsangzi* be known as *The True Dao of the Cavernous Spirit*.*

*Conforming to the established precedents of the Confucian Classics,*
*when taking the imperial examinations, one must select the transmission of Laozi,*
*and exclude Han Fei, not allowing them to be studied together.*

*Having thus explained the origin of this Explication,*
*I now proceed to elucidate the main text.*

*The Explication is divided into two parts:*
*The first part expounds the title of the Explication,*
*and the second part interprets the doctrinal categories within.*

*Now, at the outset,*
*I first expound the title of the Explication:*
*The *Explication of the Daoist Teachings of Virtue and Power* is the title,*
*which is also the title of the Classic itself.*

*Below, I will clarify the term "Explication":*
*It signifies the interpretation and elucidation of profound meaning,*
*referring to the Classic containing myriad teachings,*
*deep and mysterious in their subtlety,*
*though commentaries and annotations may have concluded,*
*yet the text’s full meaning remains unexplored.*
*Thus, this Explication is composed to open the hidden traces,*
*to elucidate the profound mysteries,*
*and to clarify the meanings,*
*so that they may be readily understood—*
*hence the term "Explication."*

*Alternatively, "Explication" may be termed "Classification,"*
*as it systematically organizes the Classic’s teachings,*
*making them easily comprehensible.*
*Or it may be termed "Record,"*
*as it records the Classic’s principles.*
*This naming varies according to the times,*
*but all share the intent of encompassing meaning and principle.*

*"Expounding the title and its instruction" refers to*
*the act of expounding,*
*which means to clarify and resolve the Classic’s title.*

*The title is the first guide for study,*
*and all scriptures, histories, and treatises*
*first mark their primary themes,*
*so that they may be understood at a glance.*
*This is why the term "title" is used—*
*it signifies the proclamation of fundamental principles.*

*"Instruction" means doctrinal teaching,*
*and its purpose is to elucidate the text’s meaning,*
*as the Six Scripts [of Chinese writing] differ in their interpretations.*
*Generally, the origins of writing*
*are said to begin with the ancient seal script,*
*which was transmitted from the celestial realm,*
*and the Compière [Cangjie] later modeled it,*
*bringing it into human use.*

*Its fundamental categories are six:*
*1. Symbolic representation [xiàngxíng], as in the characters for sun and moon.*
*2. Indicating events [zhǐshì], as in the characters for above and below.*
*3. Phonetic borrowing [jiǎjiè], as in the character for "walk" [xíng].*
*4. Compound phonetic and semantic [xíngshēng], as in the characters for river and stream.*
*5. Composite meaning [huìyì], such as "stop" + "halberd" = "martial" [wǔ],*
*"person" + "speech" = "trustworthy" [xìn],*
*"inverted" + "upright" = "exhausted" [fá].*
*6. Derivative explanation [zhuǎnzhù], as in the characters for "old" and "left" [lǎo].*

*Since the Six Scripts differ in their meanings,*
*and characters like compound phonetic, phonetic borrowing,*
*and derivative explanation are formed through these distinctions,*
*they must be elucidated by instruction,*
*so that their meanings and principles may be clarified.*

*The *Er Ya* [Classic of Categories] has its Explications,*
*and the *Mao Shi* [Mao Commentary on the Classic of Poetry] has its Glosses,*
*which are of the same nature.*

*As for "Explication of the Imperial Composition,"*
*its meaning has already been clarified above.*

*Now, I proceed to elucidate the Explication itself,*
*which is the Imperial Composition’s own elucidation.*

*The Sage refers to Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty,*
*who was the thirty-sixth descendant of the Supreme Daoist Laozi,*
*the third son of Emperor Ruizong,*
*and the sixth emperor of the Great Tang.*

*He bore the celestial signs of the Dragon and the Sun,*
*and his birth marked the fulfillment of auspicious omens.*
*His reign aligned with the *Taiping* [Great Peace] era,*
*and he ascended the throne in the year of *Renchen* [the auspicious cycle].*
*His mother was the illustrious Empress Dowager Zhaocheng Shunsheng of the Wu Clan.*

*Born on the fifth day of the eighth month,*
*of the year *Yǒuyǒu* [Stele] in the *East Capital* [Luoyang],*
*he was from his birth endowed with keen intelligence and wisdom.*
*As he grew,*
*he was magnanimous and kind, filial and fraternal,*
*fond of learning and skilled in composition,*
*valiant and decisive,*
*particularly adept at calligraphy,*
*and also proficient in horsemanship and archery.*

*In the third year, during the intercalary month,*
*on the day *Dīngmǎo* [Wood Sheep],*
*he was ennobled as the Duke of Chu.*
*In the second year of Tianzuo [Heavenly Assistance],*
*on the tenth month, the day *Wùxū* [Wood Hare],*
*he was appointed to the Grand Council and established his own bureaucracy,*
*with officials and attendants in place.*

*In the second year of Changshou [Long Life],*
*he was ennobled as the Duke of Linzi,*
*and resided at the Xingqing District.*

*In the second year of Jinglong [Auspicious Dragon],*
*he was dispatched to serve as the Deputy Governor of Lu Prefecture.*
*At that time,*
*the prefecture’s borders were marked by the daily rising of the sun and the moon’s double revolutions,*
*the hunting of deer and crossing of rivers,*
*the red dragon perched upon its walls,*
*the fine grains clustering in the fields,*
*the yellow dragon ascending the city,*
*the celestial caves opening spontaneously,*
*the children’s songs echoing in response,*
*the reappearance of the yellow dragon,*
*the red carp leaping from the waves,*
*the twin Li trees intertwining,*
*the divine divination stalks standing tall,*
*the auspicious vapors in the sleeping hall,*
*the purple mist at the Jar’s Mouth,*
*the hidden dragon lingering in the mountains,*
*the giant footprints left behind,*
*the breath of Xia Yu [legendary sage] manifest,*
*the golden bridge of the Sage,*
*and the blessings passed down by the divine man—*
*a total of nineteen celestial omens,*
*all recorded in the annals of history.*

*In the first year of Tang Long [Tang’s Prosperity],*
*he entered to execute the punishment of Empress Wu,*
*quelling the internal rebellion,*
*and escorted Emperor Ruizong to the throne.*

*By the first year of Kaiyuan [Opening of the Way],*
*he ascended as the Chancellor Ping Wang,*
*and ruled for forty-four years.*
*In the fourteenth year of Tianbao [Heavenly Treasure],*
*he abdicated the throne to the Crown Prince.*

*In the first year of Baoying [Treasure Response],*
*on the day *Rénchén* [Metal Tiger],*
*he passed away at the age of seventy-eight.*

*"Imperial"* [御] refers to the sovereign’s personal attendance,*
*as in "Imperial Residence" or "Imperial Heaven."*
*"Composition"* [制] means to create or establish,*
*as in "Establishing Rituals and Music."*

*Having thus expounded the title of the Explication,*
*I now proceed to the main text.*

Now I shall expound the following text, summarizing the *cishu* [commentary] in two broad sections:

1. **The overarching exposition of the Daoist intent**
2. **The opening chapter’s elucidation of the text**

Within the overarching exposition, there are two further divisions:
1. **The principle being expounded**—namely, the two characters *Dao* and *virtue*.
2. **The teaching that expounds it**—namely, the single character *jing* [Classic].

The full explanation lies within; distinctions shall be made in the subsequent chapter titles below.

As for these two characters, *Dao* and *virtue*, they encompass the origin of all things born and nurtured, the subtlety of governing the realm and cultivating the self—all are contained herein.

In antiquity, Master Ge Xuan, the Immortal Sage, spoke to Sun Quan, King of Wu:
*"The* Dao De Jing *is the utmost subtlety of Heaven and Earth. Within it are the Way of Heaven, the Way of Humanity, and the Way of the Divine. It encompasses all without exclusion, penetrates all without omission—it is fitting to follow."*

Within this doctrine’s broad intent, there are thirty-eight distinct teachings:

**First**, it teaches *wuwei* [non-action] as the principle of governance.
The *Classic* says:
*"Abandon the sage, discard wisdom—human benefit increases a hundredfold;
Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness—humanity returns to filial piety and compassion;
Abandon cleverness, discard profit—thieves and robbers vanish."*
It also says:
*"To love the people and govern the realm—how can one not practice* wuwei?"
And again:
*"I practice* wuwei*, yet the people transform spontaneously."*

**Second**, it teaches cultivating the Dao in the world.
The *Classic* says:
*"Cultivate it in the world, and its virtue becomes universal."*
It also says:
*"Hold fast to the ancient Way to govern the present."*
And again:
*"Hold to the Great Image—all under Heaven will follow."*

**Third**, it teaches governing the realm with the Dao.
The *Classic* says:
*"Govern the world with the Dao—its spirits shall not be numinous.
If its spirits are not numinous, its numinous shall not harm the people."*
It also says:
*"When the world lacks the Dao, warhorses arise in the suburbs."*

**Fourth**, it teaches *wuwei* as the method of aligning with Heaven.
The *Classic* says:
*"Humanity follows Earth; Earth follows Heaven."*
It also says:
*"The Dao constantly does nothing yet nothing remains undone.
If lords and kings could uphold this, all things would spontaneously transform."*

**Fifth**, it teaches that one should not, by virtue of exalted status, hold the world lightly.
The *Classic* says:
*"To hold the world with one’s person—how could it be entrusted to the world?
To love the world with one’s person—how could it be committed to the world?"*
It also says:
*"How can a sovereign of ten thousand chariots hold the world lightly?
Lightness leads to losing ministers; haste leads to losing the realm."*
And again:
*"The Sage does not seek greatness—thus can greatness be achieved."*

**Sixth**, it teaches not to exalt the worthy, not to treasure riches.
The *Classic* says:
*"Not to exalt the worthy—so that people do not contend;
Not to treasure acquired wealth—so that people do not become thieves."*
It also says:
*"Desire what is not desired—do not treasure what is hard to obtain."*

**Seventh**, it teaches cultivating the people with *wuwei* and *wu yu* [non-desire].
The *Classic* says:
*"Always keep the people without knowledge and without desire—so that those with knowledge dare not act.
To act in* wuwei *is to govern without fail."*
It also says:
*"I do nothing, yet the people grow rich;
I desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity."*
And again:
*"By not desiring, one attains stillness—the world will spontaneously rectify itself."*

**Eighth**, it teaches equanimity toward all things, without clinging to fame and gain.
The *Classic* says:
*"Heaven and Earth are not benevolent—they treat all things as straw dogs.
The Sage is not benevolent—they treat the people as straw dogs."*
It also says:
*"Practice the teaching of non-action."*
And again:
*"Act without claiming merit; achieve without dwelling on it."*

**Ninth**, it teaches non-attachment and non-obstruction.
The *Classic* says:
*"To act is to ruin it; to grasp is to lose it."*
It also says:
*"Abandon excess, abandon extravagance, abandon excessiveness."*
And again:
*"The Sage has no fixed heart—taking the people’s heart as their own."*

**Tenth**, it teaches humility as the foundation.
The *Classic* says:
*"The noble takes the base as its root; the high takes the low as its foundation."*
It also says:
*"The seas and rivers become kings of the valleys because they excel in descending."*
And again:
*"To bear the filth of the state is to be called the sovereign’s guardian.
To bear the state’s misfortunes is to be called the king of the world."*
It also says:
*"Great states should act as the lowly."*
And again:

And again:
*"The great man dwells in its depth,
Not in its shallowness.

And again:
*"The gentleman walks all day,
Never departing from his provisions."*

The *Classic* says:

Then great authority shall arrive."*

*"Traveling by land, one does not encounter rhinoceros or tigers;
Entering battle, one is not struck by weapons."*
And again:
*"Because one abides in the place of no-death."*

These thirty-eight distinctions are set forth to elucidate the great intent of the *Classic*.
Yet this *Classic* is vast—encompassing all without exclusion, and minute—penetrating to the finest hairs.
How could thirty-eight gates exhaust its essence?
To preserve its teachings, I broadly outline its principles,
Yet even this is but a fraction of a fraction compared to the autumn hair’s tip.

The *Records of Rites* says:
*"The Dao/Way—one cannot for an instant depart from it.
If one can depart, it is not the Dao/Way."*

If a ruler lacks virtue/power, it is like gazing without two eyes.
If a minister lacks virtue/power, it is like a chest without five viscera.
If one governs a household without virtue/power, it is like a corpse stiff with no breath.

Thus, the Dao/Way is indispensable to humanity.
If one abandons spoken teachings and rejects explicit instruction,
Mysterious beyond mystery, wondrous beyond wonder,
It can be divinely illuminated yet cannot be spoken of—
This is the ultimate of the Dao/Way.

The above summary is now complete.
Below, the text unfolds to elucidate the words.

*Moral and Virtue Classic: Broad Explication of Sacred Meaning, Volume One complete.
Moral and Virtue Classic: Broad Explication of Sacred Meaning, Volume Two begins.*

*Explication of the *Dao De Jing* by Master Du Guangting of the Tang Dynasty: Clarifying the Lineage, Descent, and Era of the Venerable Lord Lao*

**Commentary:**

The Venerable Lord Lao is the inner title of the *Tai Shang Xuan Yuan Huang Di* [Supreme Primordial Emperor of the Dao]. In meaning: first, he is the one who expounds upon the teachings; second, he is the Sage who can expound upon the sacred. The Sage who can expound upon the sacred is none other than the Venerable Lord Lao. The *Tai Shang* denotes his attainment of the highest fruit and exalted position. The *Xuan Yuan Huang Di* signifies his manifest sovereignty and august name, with the inner title recorded in the *Zhen Jing* [True Classic].

Now, with regard to the Venerable Lord Lao’s titles and ranks, these are divided into thirty sections to elucidate their origins.

**First, the Originator of the Boundless Dao:**
The Venerable Lord Lao was born from the formless, arising from the causeless. He is the first of all Dao/Way and the ancestral origin of primordial *qi*. Without luminosity or form, without sound or voice, without hue or texture—profound and obscure, within him lies the essence, the essence most true, pervading all without boundary, hence he is called the Great Dao. The Great Dao’s manifestation is the Venerable Lord Lao, the parent of all transformations, the ultimate sovereign of Nature.

**Second, the Embodiment of Naturalness:**
The Great Dao and primordial *qi*, forming and transforming naturally, takes shape in a constrained manner—this is the Venerable Lord Lao. His essence is the void, his nature is spontaneity; none can compel him to be, none can compel him not to be. He neither knows how he is nor how he is not. Thus, he is called *Zi Ran Er Ran* [So of Himself, Thus of Himself]. Master Ge Xuan’s *Preface to the Secret Teachings* states: “The Venerable Lord Lao embodies *Zi Ran Er Ran*, born before the Ultimate Non-Being, arising from the causeless, traversing the beginning and end of heaven and earth—this is what cannot be named or spoken.”

**Third, the Perceiver of the True Form:**
The Venerable Lord Lao is the ultimate essence of the non-born, the most refined spirit of the manifest. Once, within the emptiness, he condensed *qi* and solidified the true essence, taking constrained form though his body is vast beyond measure, his features complete, the sovereign of Nature. Above, none can be his equal; below, none can follow his footsteps. Dwelling in the void, he radiates like the light of the sun and moon.

**Fourth, the Responder to the Law’s Titles:**
The Venerable Lord Lao, rising from the emptiness, transforming naturally, with boundless wisdom and complete virtue, his form unmeasurable, his name limitless. In heaven, he is the master of all heavens; among the Sages, he is the lord of all Sages; among the Immortals, he is the total of all Immortals; in the True, he is the first of all True; among the stars, he is the Heavenly Sovereign Emperor; in teaching, he is the *Tai Shang Lao Jun* [Supreme Venerable Lord Lao]. Sometimes he bears a thousand and two hundred titles; sometimes he reveals a hundred and eighty names. He is called the Father of the Non-Doing, the Mother of All Things, harmonizing with the Great Dao, establishing the roots of heaven and earth. His vast and boundless essence cannot be named. To summarize: there are ten titles bestowed upon him after his descent, by the ten-directional Sages in the void. These are detailed in the section on his descent.

**Fifth, the Initiator of the Master-Disciple Lineage:**
When the Venerable Lord Lao was about to reveal the Great Teaching and spread its transformation across all directions, he declared: “The Dao cannot lack a revered master, the teaching cannot lack a宗主 [*zong zhu*, ‘lineage lord’].” Thus, he became a disciple of the *Tai Shang Yu Chen Da Dao Jun* [Supreme Morning Great Dao Lord]. The Great Dao Lord is the disciple of the *Yuan Shi Tian Zun* [Primordial Beginning Heavenly Sovereign], who discerns the foundation of the Dao and penetrates its origin, born before countless eons, the ancestral *qi* of the Dao. The Heavenly Sovereign is the master of five billion heavens, the lord of countless Sages, also born before countless eons, the root foundation of the Dao’s *qi*.

Thus, the Great Dao Lord is the Venerable Lord Lao’s master, and the Heavenly Sovereign is the master of the Great Dao Lord. With the two Sages established, he is called the Venerable Lord Lao—*lao* for his abiding in longevity, *jun* for his lordship over the lineage. Since the Venerable Lord Lao, above and below the heavens, traverses transformations without end, born before countless eons and enduring beyond them, revered by all emperors and followed by all masters, he is thus granted the title *Tai Shang Lao Jun* [Supreme Venerable Lord Lao]. The three Sages, mastering one another, thereby establish the foundation of teaching’s hierarchy.

Zhuangzi says: *“My master, my master! He nourishes all things yet does not deem it virtue, benefits countless ages yet does not deem it benevolence, surpasses the ancient sages yet does not deem himself old, encompasses heaven and earth, carves all forms yet does not deem it skillful, precedes the Supreme Ultimate yet does not deem himself exalted, dwells beneath the six extremes yet does not deem himself profound, is born before heaven and earth yet does not deem himself eternal—this is he!”*

**Sixth, the Traverser of Eons:**
The Venerable Lord Lao was born before all things, arising before the formless. He has traversed countless eons, his existence most ancient. The *effort* [劫, *jie*] is the name for the formation and destruction of heaven and earth, the measure of the exhaustion of yin and yang. When yang is exhausted, yin is born—thus, it is the Great Water. When yin is exhausted, yang is born—thus, it is the Great Fire. Yang reaches its peak at nine, hence it is called *Yang Jiu* [Nine Yang]. Yin reaches its peak at six, hence it is called *Bai Liu* [Six Hundred]. The smallest eon is three thousand three hundred years; the next is nine thousand nine hundred years; the greatest is the *Jiu Jiu Da Shu* [Ninety-Nine Great Number], eighty-one million years, marking the end of an eon. The Venerable Lord Lao’s longevity and transformations traverse these eons beyond count.

The *Western Ascension Scripture* states: *“Since the beginning of this past age, the changes have been as numerous as grains of sand. When the eons shift, the records are renewed—only then does one realize the depth of his toil.”*

**Seventh, the Creator of Heaven and Earth:**
The Venerable Lord Lao is the root foundation of heaven and earth; all things originate from him and are formed. Thus, he stands upon the path of non-haste, wanders in the field of no-dependence, ascends and descends in the void, riding yin and yang to refine and transform. He distributes the pure and turbid, opens the expanse of heaven and earth, suspends the Three Luminaries [日月星, *ri yue xing*] and nourishes all beings. Heaven and earth rely upon him for their distinction, the sun and moon move by his decree, the four seasons gain from him their succession, the five phases [五行, *wu xing*] derive from him their generation. Thus, at the beginning of the nine trillion nine hundred trillion nine hundred trillion nine hundred trillion nine hundred billion years of *qi*, he moves the *Xuan Yuan Shi* [Primordial Beginning Three *qi*] to form heaven, above establishing the Three Pure Ones and Three Realms.

At the outset, the *Shi* *qi* becomes the **Jade Purity Realm**, the *Yuan* *qi* the **Upper Purity Realm**, and the *Xuan* *qi* the **Supreme Purity Realm**.

Again, from the three Purity *qi*, each generates three *qi* and three Realms, together forming nine *qi* to constitute the **Nine Heavens**:
1. **Yùdān Wúliàng Heaven** (Idle Solitude Boundless Heaven),
2. **Shàngshàng Chánshàn Wúliàngshòu Heaven** (Supreme Meditative Bliss Boundless Longevity Heaven),
3. **Fánjiān Xūyán Heaven** (Brahmanic Monitor Mustard-Field Heaven),
4. **Jìrán Dōushù Heaven** (Silent Tranquility Enclosure Heaven),
5. **Bōluónímì Bùjiāolè Heaven** (Brahma’s Secret Non-Arrogant Bliss Heaven),
6. **Dòngyuán Huàyīngshēng Heaven** (Void-Origin Transforming Responsive-Sound Heaven),
7. **Línghuà Fánfǔ Heaven** (Spiritual Transformation Brahmanic Auxiliary Heaven),
8. **Gāoxū Qīngmíng Heaven** (Lofty Void Luminous Heaven),
9. **Wúxiǎng Wújié Wù’ài Heaven** (Non-Conceptual Non-Knot Non-Love Heaven).

Each of these Nine Heavens generates three *qi*, each *qi* forming one Heaven, totaling **Twenty-Seven Heavens**. Together, these Nine Heavens constitute **Thirty-Six Heavens**.

Below them, the **Four Classes and Three Realms** ascend to the utmost of the Three Purity Realms.

The first six Heavens below are the **Realm of Desire**:
1. **Tàihuáng Heaven** (Great Yellow Heaven),
2. **Tàimíng Heaven** (Great Bright Heaven),
3. **Qīngmíng Heaven** (Clear Bright Heaven),
4. **Xuántāi Heaven** (Mysterious Embryo Heaven),
5. **Yuánmíng Heaven** (Primordial Bright Heaven),
6. **Qīyào Heaven** (Seven Luminaries Heaven).

Next, the **Eighteen Heavens of the Realm of Form**:
1. **Xūwú Heaven** (Voidless Heaven),
2. **Tàijí Heaven** (Supreme Pole Heaven),
3. **Chìmíng Heaven** (Crimson Bright Heaven),
4. **Gōnghuá Heaven** (Resplendent Splendor Heaven),
5. **Yàomíng Heaven** (Luminous Brilliance Heaven),
6. **Huángjiā Heaven** (Royal Horn Heaven),
7. **Xūmíng Heaven** (Void-Bright Heaven),
8. **Duānjìng Heaven** (Serene Tranquility Heaven),
9. **Xuánmíng Heaven** (Mysterious Bright Heaven),
10. **Jíyáo Heaven** (Extreme Jade Heaven),
11. **Yuánzǎi Heaven** (Primordial Load Heaven),
12. **Tài’ān Heaven** (Great Tranquility Heaven),
13. **Jífēng Heaven** (Extreme Wind Heaven),
14. **Shǐhuáng Heaven** (First Sovereign Heaven),
15. **Tàihuáng Heaven** (Great Yellow Heaven),
16. **Wúsī Heaven** (Non-Thought Heaven),
17. **Shàngxiéruǎnlè Heaven** (Upper Exalted Softness Bliss Heaven),
18. **Wújí Tánshì Heaven** (Boundless Meditation Heaven).

Next, the **Four Heavens of the Realm of Formlessness**:
1. **Xiāngdù Heaven** (Lofty Measure Heaven),
2. **Yuándòng Heaven** (Primordial Cavern Heaven),
3. **Miǎochéng Heaven** (Wondrous Completion Heaven),
4. **Jìnshàng Heaven** (Forbidden Upper Heaven).

These **Twenty-Eight Heavens** are called the **Three Realms**.

Where the eons unfold and yin-yang refine, where *qi* reaches its limits and human lifespans are measured, the first, **Tàihuánghuángzēng Heaven**, grants mortals a lifespan of **nine hundred million years**. Each successive Heaven adds a doubling of years, so across the Twenty-Eight Heavens, the maximum lifespan reaches **one trillion two hundred seventy-nine thousand seven hundred seventy-five million five thousand two hundred years**.

Descending to where the sun and moon intersect, there are **four thousand four hundred forty-four billion four hundred forty-four billion *qi***, each *qi* spanning **three thousand *li***.

Above these, there are four more Heavens, called the **Four Kinds of Human Heavens**:
1. **Chángróng Heaven** (Ever-Melting Heaven),
2. **Yùlóng Heaven** (Jade Dragon Heaven),
3. **Fándù Heaven** (Brahmanic Measure Heaven),
4. **Jiáyù Heaven** (Jade Jade Heaven).

These Four Heavens transcend the Three Realms, neither generating nor perishing, without measure of years or ruin by calamity. At the interchange of great eons, their disasters do not reach them.

The lesser Heavens and Earths below follow the eons in their ruin; when the eons reopen, the chaos redivides, and the people of these Heavens, bearing the command of the **Most High**, descend to transform the mortal world, teaching the age and practicing the Dao—just as at the beginning of this eon, the **Three Sovereigns** succeeded in governance.

Above these, there are three more Heavens, the **Three Purity Realms**:
1. **Dàchì Heaven** (Great Vermilion Heaven),
2. **Yǔyú Heaven** (Yu’s Remnant Heaven),
3. **Qīngwēi Heaven** (Pure Mists Heaven).

The highest is the **Dàluó Heaven** (Great Net Heaven), encompassing all Heavens, supremely exalted without peer. The **Playful Metropolis of Jade** is stationed at its summit, where the **Three Venerables** reside, and all saints assemble in reverence—this is the domain of the **Ultimate Dao**, the root of transformation.

Having divided the Heavens, the residual yin *qi* of the Thirty-Six Heavens descends to form the **Thirty-Six Earths**. Each Heaven establishes a **Heavenly Sovereign**, each Earth a **Terrene Emperor**, and the **Seventy-Two Lords** all receive their commands from the **Old Lord**.

The domains of these Heavens vary in number by **five hundred million**, all generated by the *qi* of the Thirty-Six Heavens. Within the Earth are **Thirty-Six Cavern Heavens**, corresponding to those above. The sun and moon refine their essence, their luminous radiance permeating between them, so that celestial patterns and terrestrial geography, the **Six Celestial Stems and Five Phases**, the transformations of yin and yang—all are wrought by the **Old Lord’s** subtle operations, generated and perfected, moved and transformed by them.

Thus it is said: The **Dao** is the **Primordial Source** of all things; Heaven attains clarity through it, Earth attains tranquility, beings attain birth, spirits attain numinousness, the seas and mountains attain stability, kings attain the Great Peace, Daoists attain immortality, and the withered attain rebirth.

The **Most High Old Lord** is the **Master of Yin-Yang**, the **Sovereign of All Spirits**, the **Parent of Primordial *Qi***, the **Root of Heaven and Earth**, the **Teacher of the Ancient Kings**, and the **Soul of All Beings**. He molds the void, transforms and responds to things, girds the Eight Extremes, suspends the Earth and upholds the Heaven, rides the sun and moon, drives the stars, breathes the Six Celestial Stems, commands the Heavenly Poles, shifts the Four Seasons, adjusts cold and warmth, summons winds and rains, drums the thunderclouds, distinguishes the Mysterious Yellow, reckons the void and fullness—his **subordinate and superior, father and son, all observe propriety and righteousness**.

Thus, though yin-yang be vast and Heaven and Earth great, without the **Dao’s *qi** nurturing them and the **Great Sage** moving them, there would be no generation or transformation, no establishment or completion.

**Eighth: The Ascension to Sovereign Rule.**
The **Old Lord’s** great sagehood—generating and transforming Heaven and Earth, moving and nurturing all things—how could it lack rank or name? Yet above him stands the **Primordial Beginning’s** exaltation, below him the **Dao Sovereign’s** sanctity. The **Old Lord** ranks beneath the **Dao Sovereign**, yet through his transformations and deeds, having moved the three *qi* to circulate and the myriad Heavens to spread, all laws manifesting, his **mysterious merit** accomplished, he ascends to certify the **Ultimate Dao’s** fruit, residing in the **Three Venerables’** station. He inherits the **Most High’s** task, becoming the **Law King’s** exaltation, governing all saints above, regulating all true ones within, commanding all immortals below, and thus overseeing the **Thirty-Six Heavens**, the **Thirty-Six Earths**, the **Seventy-Two Lords**, the stars, sun, and moon, the mountains and rivers, all spirits—all transformations of yin and yang, all divine manifestations—he rules over **Heaven above and below, Earth above and below, the Five Hundred Million Heavenly Realms**, beings with and without sentience, with and without cognition, with and without form—all are under the **Most High Old Lord’s** dominion.

「Thus, he eternally abides within the **Tàiqīng** domain in the **Tàijí** Palace, the **Dāntái** Purple Portal, and the **Yùtáng** Jade Hall, where the **Three Great Immortals**, the **Nine Most High Emperors**, the **Twenty-Seven Heavenly Lords**, the **Eighty-One Coasts and Ministers**, the **Thousand-Two-Hundred Immortal Officials**, the **Twenty-Four-Thousand Spirit Attendants**, the **Seventy-Thousand Immortal Boys and Jade Girls**, and the **Five-Hundred-Million Heavenly Soldiers and Divine Kings**, along with the **Lúowèi** Cloud Street, **giant qióng** (虬) serpents, **lions**, **golden-winged peacocks**, **phoenixes**, **spiritual beasts**, **celestial horses**, and **qílín** (麒麟), all stand guard at his sides.

At times, the **Old Lord** also ascends to the **Yuánshǐ** (元始) court, submitting petitions on **sin and fortune**, paying homage to the **Yùchén** (玉宸), overseeing the **Nine Palaces**, and regulating the records of **birth and death in the Three Realms**. All divine officials and ghostly ministers—those who inspect and investigate, the **immortal officials of the spirit caves**, and those who dispense **blessings and sustenance**—whether in the depths or the hidden, all reverently submit to his authority.

Sometimes, he descends to govern the **Nine Heavens**, residing in the **Tàiwēi** (太微) and **Gōuchén** (勾陈) Six Stars as the **Heavenly Sovereign Great Emperor**, wielding the **Yào Pò** (曜魄) Gem of Radiance. He holds the **Three Messengers**, the **Six Guards**, and the **Nine Pivotal Mechanisms**, overseeing the **One-Five-Twenty-Thousand** (万一千五百二十) beings. He wields the **immortal talismans**, commanding the **divine humans, true humans, immortals, sages, virtuous ones, and wayfarers**, all bound under his rule.

One sees the **Hundred-Billion Heavenly Kings** bowing in homage before him, seeking counsel on matters of **wind, rain, drought, flood, abundance, scarcity, fortune, misfortune, life, death, good, and evil**. He roams the **Ten-Thousand Worlds**, transforming through the **mysterious Dao**. In his essence, he remains **Most High and Unchanging**, forever dwelling in the **Tàiqīng** Palace.

**Ninth**, he responds to circumstances and attends to feelings.
The **Old Lord** is **Ultimate and Sacred**, overseeing all transformations. His manifestations appear according to the needs of each realm, and his **virtue descends** to adapt his form. From the beginning of **countless kalpas** to the dawn of **Húndùn** (混沌), through the **Xī-Wā** (羲娲) **Eighteen Dynasties**, the **Three Eons**, the **Fifty-Eight Administrations**, and the **One-Hundred-Eighty-Nine Generations**, he serves as **National Teacher** in each age. In the era of **Shénnóng** (神农), he sometimes becomes **National Sovereign**, sometimes **Teacher Lord**, sometimes **Guest and Friend**, or even a **human subject**, bearing titles such as **Yùhuá** (郁华) or **Lùtú** (录图), and through **moral precepts and profound teachings**, he enlightens all.

What is called **"responding to all without discrimination"** is the **Dao**; what is called **"attending to feelings and circumstances"** is **Sainthood**. He always applies **scriptures, diagrams, and precepts** to transform all beings, adapting his form to their needs—boundless and infinite. Yet the **Old Lord’s** essence remains **perfect, still, and without action**, forever dwelling in the **Tàiqīng** Palace.

**Tenth**, he promulgates the **Upper Pure Dao**.
In the time of the **Upper Three Sovereigns**, when humanity was still **simple and unrefined**, the **Old Lord** took the title **Xuánzhōng** (玄中) **Way Master** in the **Long Hàn** (龙汉) year. He taught the **Upper Pure Sacred Doctrine’s** **Twelve Great Vehicles**, enlightening both **humans and heavens**.

**Eleventh**, he transmits the **Soul Treasure**.
In the time of the **Middle Three Sovereigns**, the **Old Lord** bore the title **Yǒugǔ** (有古) **Mr. Ancient** in the **Chìmíng** (赤明) year. He descended with the **Soul Treasure True Scripture’s** **Twelve Middle Vehicles**, transforming all and saving **myriad people**.

**Twelfth**, he issues the **Cave Spirit Scripture**.
In the time of the **Lower Three Sovereigns**, when human hearts were **simple yet scattered**, the **Old Lord** took the title **Jīnquè** (金阙) **Imperial Lord** in the **Kāihuáng** (开皇) year. He promulgated the **Cave Spirit Scripture’s** **Twelve Minor Vehicles**, enlightening all **ten-thousand kinds**.

**Thirteenth**, he reveals the **Primordial Yang Scripture**.
In the time of **Fúxī** (伏羲), when people had grown **corrupt yet lacked laws**, the **Old Lord** assumed the title **Yùhuá Zǐ** (郁华子) in the **Qīngzhuó** (清浊) year. He descended as a **teacher**, expounding the **Primordial Yang Scripture** and instructing **Fúxī** to draw the **Eight Trigrams**, thereby **communicating the virtue of the divine** and **categorizing the emotions of all things**. He looked upward to **observe the patterns in Heaven**, and downward to **take lessons from Earth**, establishing **marriage rites** and **ordering human relationships**.

**Fourteenth**, he demonstrates the **Good Life**.
In the time of **Shénnóng**, when people ate **raw flesh and drank blood**, the **Old Lord** bore the title **Dàchéng Zǐ** (大成子) in the **Qīnghàn** (清汉) year. He descended as a **teacher**, expounding the **Primordial Essence Scripture** and teaching the **Dao of transformation and nurturing**. He spread **hundred grains** to replace **cooking and slaughtering**, and harmonized **hundred medicines** to heal **hundred ailments**. He showed that **tasting mulberry yields rice**, **tasting willow yields grain**, **tasting elm yields millet**, **tasting locust tree yields beans**, **tasting peach yields small wheat**, **tasting apricot yields large wheat**, and **tasting hemp yields hemp fiber**. With the **five grains** flourishing, **beasts and birds** were spared from harm, and killing ceased—thus **lengthening goodness and eliminating evil**, **preserving life and ensuring well-being**. By not consuming **blood and flesh**, people were free from **sickness and suffering**; by the **five grains nourishing their nature**, people were free from **past karma**. His benefits to humanity were vast.

**Fifteenth**, he instructs in **Pottery and Crafting**.
In the time of **Zhùróng** (祝融), when people ate **raw and cold food**, unaware of **cooked meals**, the **Old Lord** took the title **Guǎngshòu Zǐ** (广寿子) in the **Tiānhàn** (天汉) year. He descended as a **teacher**, expounding the **Pressing and Melting Scripture to Nurture Essence** and instructing in **pottery and crafting vessels**, thereby **transforming raw and cold food**, and **prolonging human life**.

**Sixteenth**, he establishes **Laws and Ordinances**.
From the time of the **Lower Three Sovereigns** onward, until **Fúxī**, there were no **rituals or laws**, and **birds and beasts** lived in the same groups. The **Old Lord**, through the **Dao**, gradually **awakened their hearts**, distinguishing **forms and flavors**, aligning with the **Five Phases**, and widely applying **scriptures and methods**, guiding and transforming **myriad people**.

**Seventeenth**, he creates **Forms and Utensils**.
After **Fúxī**, the **Old Lord** demonstrated **worldly methods**, establishing **ritual music** to **order hierarchy**, crafting **garments and insignia** to **distinguish nobility and commonality**, building **palaces and dwellings** to **replace nests and dens**, creating **boats and carriages** to **traverse impassable terrain**, setting up **coffins and burial chambers** to **replace wrapping in cloth and kindling**, forging **bows and arrows** to **intimidate the disobedient**, instituting **legal punishments** to **deter violence**, and devising **writing and contracts** to **replace knotted cords**. He taught **riding oxen and horses**, **pulling heavy loads**, and **midday markets**—where **trade concluded and people returned home**—though **plowing, grinding, and double-door locks** were not yet known. All these teachings were imparted to **worldly rulers**, transforming **all things** in their time.

**Eighteenth**, he expounds the **Dao on Kōngtóng Mountain**.
In the time of **Huángdì** (黄帝), the **Old Lord** was known as **Guǎngchéng Zǐ** (广成子), dwelling on **Kōngtóng Mountain**. **Huángdì** visited him and took him as **teacher**, receiving the **Scripture of Dao Precepts**. He was taught the **method of governing the body**. **Huángdì** practiced it, and in broad daylight ascended to **Heaven**.

**Nineteenth**, in the time of **Zhuànxū** (颛顼), the Old Lord descended as teacher, bearing the name **Chìjīng Zǐ** (赤精子), dwelling on **Héngshān**. He imparted to the emperor the *Scripture of Subtle Speech* (《微言经》), teaching the **Dao of loyalty and compliance**.

**Twentieth**, the **Dao manifested at the riverside**. In the time of **Yù** (帝舜), the Old Lord descended as teacher, bearing the name **Lùtú Zǐ** (录图子), dwelling by the riverside. He imparted to the emperor the *Yellow Court Scripture* (《黄庭经》), teaching the **Dao of purity and harmony**.

**Twenty-first**, the **Dao proclaimed its truth on Gūshè**. In the time of **Emperor Yáo** (唐尧), the Old Lord descended as teacher, bearing the name **Wùchéng Zǐ** (务成子), dwelling on **Gūshè Mountain**. He imparted to the emperor the *Scripture of Political Separation and Union* (《政事离合经》), teaching the **Dao of frugality and caution**.

**Twenty-second**, the **transmission of Dao and virtue**. In the time of **Emperor Shùn** (帝舜), the Old Lord descended as teacher, bearing the name **Yǐnshòu Zǐ** (尹寿子), dwelling at **Héyáng**. He imparted to Shùn the *Scripture of Dao and Virtue* (《道德经》), expounding the **Dao of filial piety and fraternal duty**. These two scriptures originated from this point.

**Twenty-third**, the **teaching of water regulation**. In the time of **Xià Yǔ** (夏禹), the Old Lord descended as teacher, bearing the name **Zhēnxíng Zǐ** (真行子), dwelling on **Shāngshān**. He imparted to Yǔ the *Scripture of Virtuous Precepts* (《戒德经》), teaching the **Dao of diligence and frugality**. He also transmitted the **Five Sacred Talismans of Lingbao**, summoning spirits and ghosts, dredging the Nine Rivers, connecting the Yellow River and the sea, and opening the Hundred Streams.

**Twenty-fourth**, the **recitation of longevity**. In the time of **Yīn Tāng** (殷汤), the Old Lord descended as teacher, bearing the name **Xīzé Zǐ** (锡则子), dwelling on **Zhènshān**. He imparted the *Scripture of Longevity* (《长生经》), teaching the **Dao of reverence and benevolence**.

**Twenty-fifth**, the **conception of divine wisdom**. The Old Lord, pitying the decay of the age, wished to return in divine form and be reborn. In the seventeenth year of **Yángjiǎ** (阳甲), the eighteenth king of Yīn, in a year of **Gēngshēn**, he took conception in the **Playful Mystic Jade Maiden**. From this gate, five branches emerged:

1. The **Great Dao manifested in transformation**, taking human form, embodying the five colors of solar essence to illuminate **yang virtue**.
2. He rode the **Nine Dragons’ Chariot**, condensing and transforming, his five-colored essence merging with the **Playful Mystic Jade Maiden**, thus revealing the **Nine Dragons’ yang essence**.
3. He dwelled in the womb, nurturing wisdom, differing from the common way. After **eighty-one years**, completing the **ninefold number of the Great Sun**, he was born.
4. After the **Playful Mystic Jade Maiden** conceived through a divine dream, her beauty increased, her spirit serene, and for over eighty years, she rejoiced without compare, demonstrating the **divine traces of the Sage’s descent**.
5. The **Playful Mystic Jade Maiden’s** dwelling was ever harmonious in the four seasons, the six *qì* balanced—no winter cold, no summer heat. Auspicious light filled the chamber, sacred winds swept the courtyard, evils did not approach, and all spirits guarded unseen. For eighty-one years, time passed unnoticed, until in the ninth year of **Wǔdīng** (武丁), the twenty-second king of Yīn, in a year of **Gēngchén**, he was born.

**Twenty-sixth**, the **manifestation of his birth**. From this gate, seventeen further divisions arise:

1. The Old Lord’s birth surpassed all mortal kind. Though conceived by the **Holy Mother**, he was born by **splitting her left armpit**.
2. Upon birth, he walked nine steps, each step bearing a lotus. The earth opened beneath him, displaying his divine marvel.
3. At his birth, the **Sun Child shone radiant**, the **Moon Consort scattered flowers**, the **Seven Stars aligned their light**, auspicious clouds sheltered him, the **Four Spirits guarded**, and the **Jade Maiden bore him**. The Holy Mother, reaching for a **plum tree**, suddenly gave birth.
4. At his birth, the **Nine Dragons spewed water** to bathe his sacred form. Where the dragons emerged, **nine wells** formed. These still exist today in **Zhēn Yuán County’s** (真源县) **Tàiqīng Palace** in **Bózhōu**.
5. After birth, he walked nine steps, his left hand pointing to Heaven, his right to Earth, declaring: *"Above Heaven, below Earth, I alone am sovereign."* The sufferings of the age were unworthy of mention.
6. The Old Lord descended to birth, for he saw the age’s **crude simplicity scattered**, the **Great Dao unwalked**, and thus took mortal form to **save the world**.
7. Knowing the people were confused and the true path hard to proclaim, at his birth he displayed **auspicious omens** to awaken faith and understanding.
8. To reveal the **Mystic Dao**, he demonstrated **elixir refinement**, encouraging practice. Today, **Bózhōu Palace** holds the **Elixir-Refining Well** and the **Elixir-Refining Cypress**.
9. The Old Lord taught that **inner and outer cultivation** must both be practiced—refining the **Golden Elixir** and nurturing **true *qì***. Today, the **Hall of Emptiness and Nothingness** in **Bózhōu Palace** is where *qì* was cultivated.
10. The Old Lord made clear that mastering this **Mystic Dao** would surely lead to Heaven. He demonstrated this by **ascending lightly upon completion**. Today, the **Deer-Track Cypress** in **Bózhōu Palace** marks where he rode the **White Deer** to ascend. The tree remains.
11. The Old Lord’s birth year was the **ninth year of Wǔdīng (Gēngchén)**, the **fifteenth day of the second month**. Today, it is clarified that in the **Yīn and Zhōu eras**, the **month of *Zǐ* was the year’s beginning**, so the second month corresponds to the **modern twelfth month (*Chǒu*)**.
12. His birthplace was in the ancient **region of Chǔ**, in **Kǔ County**, later named **Lèxiāng** after its walls, and **Qǔrénlǐ** after its waters, beside **Língxī Stream** to the west of the **Nine Wells**. Originally **Kǔ County**, it became **Gǔyáng County** under the **Hàn and Wèi dynasties**. In **Buyan’s first year**, it was renamed **Zhēn Yuán County**.

The **Zhōnghé Era’s second year**, it was elevated to **Chìxiàn County**.

**13.** After the Old Lord’s birth, within nine days, his stature grew to nine *chǐ*, with seventy-two auspicious marks (*xiāng*) and eighty-one virtues (*hǎo*). He walked with five strides to ten paces, possessed beautiful arched brows and a square mouth, dual pillars and triple leaks, a sun-like horn and moon-like eyes—endowed with the great sage’s features.

**14.** The Holy Mother, **Xuānmiao Yùnǚ**, after the Old Lord’s birth, ascended to heaven in the **Bājǐng Yùyú**, attended by celestial hosts, in broad daylight. The **Great Tang** posthumously honored her as **Xiāntiān Tàihòu**. Today, there exists a palace in **Zhēn Yuán County**, north of **Tàiqīng Palace**, and another on **Lóuguān Shèngtiān Tái**.

**15.** After the Old Lord’s ascension, successive emperors revered his true traces. The **Hàn Emperor Huán** and **Sū Emperor Wén** both grandly restored his temples, commanding literati to carve steles to commemorate his **virtue/power**. Thus, the **Biān Shào Stele** of Hàn and the **Xuē Dàohéng Stele** of Sū endure to this day.

**16.** In the year the **Holy Tang** received its mandate, the ancient residence’s withered cypress revived in **Bózhōu**, signifying the prosperity of descendants and boundless blessings. The tree remains, known as the **Revival Cypress**.

**17.** In **Zhēn Yuán’s** ancestral village, divine omens repeatedly descended: sweet dew fell suddenly, auspicious clouds dispersed, or the true form manifested to dispel calamity; mist congealed in the sky to guard the halls; divine birds bore arrows, or sudden snowflakes flew; a spirit dragon leapt within the **Nine Wells**, or sacred script appeared upon the three cypresses. These marvels were recorded in the annals.

During the **Hàn Emperor Huán’s** reign, he dreamed of the Old Lord and, upon building the shrine, saw auspicious clouds hovering above. In the **Sū Emperor Wén’s** **Kāihuáng fifth year**, auspicious clouds and a white deer appeared in the temple courtyard, prompting imperial restoration of the halls. In **Wǔdé’s third year**, the withered cypress revived, and auspicious clouds appeared above it. In **Shàngyuán’s first year**, the phrase **"Buānyuán Hénlì Zhen"** appeared in crimson on the cypress branches, clearly layered. In **Tàijí’s first year**, auspicious clouds manifested above. In **Tiānbǎo’s seventh year**, a **phoenix** gathered upon the **Xūwú Hall**. In **Bǎoyìng’s first year**, a purple cloud connected to heaven, its divine light shining at night. The next day, a dragon appeared over the **Nine Wells**. In **Dàlì’s third year**, auspicious clouds appeared over the palace, and sweet dew descended upon the cypress. In **Huìchāng’s second year**, sweet dew fell upon the courtyard trees. In **Xiàntōng’s tenth year**, the rebel **Páng Xún** of **Xúzhōu** sought to seize **Tàiqīng Palace** with his forces, but the Old Lord manifested—black qi spread across the valley, and the rebels lost their way, vanquished that day.

Later, during the **Zhōnghé and Guāngmíng eras**, **Huáng Cháo** besieged the palace, setting it ablaze. Dark clouds rose, rain extinguished the fire, and the rebels scattered in defeat. Elsewhere, rebels surrounded **Bózhōu** with blades, but black qi and heavy snow froze them to death, lifting the siege. Again, **Huáng Cháo’s** remnants attacked, but a divine bird circled the city bearing arrows, and black qi emerged from the palace. The rebels fled in terror, the siege lifted.

In the **Zhōnghé Era’s second year**, the official **Pán Chóu** reported that since **Huáng Cháo’s** march into **Guānzhōu**, eighteen times had rebels besieged the palace or encircled the county—each time met with portents, causing the rebels to scatter. Near and far, households fled to the palace for refuge, all emerging unharmed. He petitioned to relocate the county to the palace grounds, but the edict was denied, and it was instead elevated to **Chìxiàn County**.

In the **Guāngqǐ Era’s first year, seventh month**, five clouds formed a canopy over the **Nine Dragon Well**, rising a thousand *zhàng* in height—such manifestations occurred three times. Illustrations were sent from **Biànzhōu** and recorded in the imperial annals.

**Chapter Twenty-Seventh: Declaring the Sacred Appellation**

The **Venerable Lord’s** jade embryo bore wisdom, and at the eighty-first year of his sacred birth, he was born with white hair. The **Sage Mother** established his name to reveal this to the world.

Within this gate, five divisions are made:

1. **The Sage’s descent into the world, differing from the common.** The Sage Mother wished to call him *Old* (老), yet he was newly born, so she wished to call him *Child* (子). Since he was already aged, she combined both terms, thus establishing the name **Laozi**.

2. **The Dao opposes convention.** *Old* refers to advanced years, *Child* to infancy. Mortals age after youth, but the Venerable Lord was aged before youth—this to show the return to the origin after tracing the path.

3. **The *Old* denotes examination of all sages, the *Child* signifies the proliferation of all things.** Thus, the Venerable Lord is the parent of all things and the ancestral progenitor of all sages, bearing the name of examination and proliferation, as **Laozi**.

The two characters *Laozi* arose at this time, but the title **Laojun** predates countless eons—it was not established solely in this age.

4. **The Sage’s name reverses the end to return to the beginning.** *Old* is the end, *Child* the beginning. Mortals begin before ending, but the Venerable Lord ends before beginning, urging the world to cultivate the Dao, returning to infancy from old age—thus the name **Laozi**.

5. **Hiding one’s traces and blending with the world, following the path of the age.** The Venerable Lord, born with white hair, was thus named **Laozi**—a common male appellation, like **Kongzi, Mengzi, Zhuangzi, Liezi**, who took their surnames as names. **Laozi, Heguanzzi, Baopuzzi, Huainanzi** took names based on their deeds. The *Sequence of Precepts* states:

*"The name **Laozi** originated in countless eons past, obscure and distant beyond measure. It was not because he aged at birth that he was named **Laozi**, but because he existed eons before, thus bearing the name **Laozi**.*

*He was borne by the divine Li Mother, emerging from her left armpit, already radiant, and thus named **Laozi**. The name **Laozi** arose from the Mysterious, before Heaven and Earth, without the limits of aging. Hence, he is called **Laozi**—as attested in the *Sequence of Precepts*."*

Now examining all accounts, it is clear that the name **Laozi** was not established solely because of his birth. Throughout countless eons, he manifested teachings, embodied form, and perpetually appeared in aged guise—thus the name **Laozi**.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Eighth: Clarifying the Lineage**

The *Laozi Original Record* and various histories all state that he was born beneath a **plum tree**, and he pointed to the tree, declaring it his surname—this reasoning is correct.

According to the *Great Enunciation Jade Register of the Tang Dynasty*, he descended from **Zhuānxū**, who begot **Dàyè**, who begot **Wā**, who married a daughter of the **Qiáo clan**, conceiving **Jiǔliáo** through the moon’s light piercing **Mǎo**. **Jiǔliáo** begot **Bóyì**, whose descendants served as **shìshī** (judicial officials). When **Lǐ** fled the chaos of **Jiè**, he took refuge in the ruins of **Yīhóu**, sustaining himself on **plum fruit** and thus changing his surname to **Lǐ**.

This refers to the descendants of **Jiǔxiàn**, who earned their surname **Lǐ** through judicial service. Later descendants sometimes changed it to **Lǐ** (里), and upon fleeing to **Yīhóu’s ruins**, they altered it to **Lǐ** (李), signifying *prosperity and sincerity*—this was during the time of **Tāng**. **Lǐ** begot **Chāngzǔ**, who served as a **dàfū** in **Chén**, residing in **Kǔ County**. **Chāngzǔ** begot **Míng**, who became **Chén’s chancellor**, and was buried north of **Làxiāng**, where a temple was erected, giving rise to **Xiàngchéng**. **Míng** begot **Qìngbīn**, who begot **Língfēi** (also called **Qiánhuì**). Both **Qìngbīn** and **Língfēi** ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

The **Chén** spoken of here is the ancient **Chén state**, not the one later granted to **Hú Gōng Mǎn** by the **Zhōu**.

From **Tāng** to **Yángjiǎ**, eighteen sovereigns reigned over **250 years**. From **Lǐ Zhēng** to **Qiánhuì**, five generations succeeded one another, aligning with this era—when the **Tàixuàn** period was already under **Chén’s rule**. When the **Zhōu** enfeoffed **Shùn’s descendants**, this was the same **Chén**. After its destruction, **Hú Gōng** was enfeoffed there.

**Língfēi’s** wife, **Xuánmiào Yùnǚ**, conceived the **Venerable Lord** after dreaming of the sun’s essence. This is the first account.

Again, the *Original Record* states: **Laozi**, born speaking, pointed to the **plum tree** and said, *"This is my surname."* Thus, he took **Lǐ** as his surname. Hence, **Xuē Dàohéng**, a **Lǐshì** of the **Sui**, inscribed on the **Laojun Temple Courtyard Stele**:

*"Conceived by the sun’s radiance at birth, his origin in qi is unfathomable. He pointed to the tree as his surname—this is the true source of the *blowing of the flute*."*

The *Lóuguān Xian Shī Zhuan* states: **Laojun**, after the **Sage Mother** ascended the **plum tree**, declared, *"This is your surname."*

These three accounts are fully recorded in scripture and tradition; now they are all clarified to illuminate the **national surname and ancestral lineage**.

The **Sage Mother**, according to the *Record of the Mysterious Center*, was **Lǐ Língfēi** of the **Yīn dynasty**, whose father and son successively cultivated the **Dao of longevity**. **Qìngbīn**, over a hundred years old, retained youthful appearance, wandering the **Five Sacred Peaks**. One day, in his dwelling, a **cloud-dragon** descended to welcome him, and he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. **Língfēi**, moved by his father’s ascension, secluded himself in deep retreat, cultivating within, and took **Yīn Shì** of **Tiānshuǐ** as his wife, residing in **Làxiāng**. His wife, while napping at noon, dreamed that Heaven opened wide, and celestial beings bore the sun from that place. After some time, the sun shrank and fell from Heaven, transforming into a **five-colored pearl** the size of a **bullet**. She swallowed it in the dream and became pregnant.

Eighty-one years later, her complexion grew ever younger, resembling a maiden. **Língfēi**, also over a hundred years old, ascended to heaven. After **Laojun** was born, **five-colored cloud chariots** descended to welcome him, bearing him away to Heaven.

The *Great Ancestral Lineage of the Lǐ Clan* states: The **Lǐ** surname originated from **Huángdì’s** descendants, surnamed **Gōngsūn**, known as **Xuānyuán**.

The **Yuanfei** of the Xīlíng clan bore **Chāngyì**, whose wife, **Fāngléi** of the **Fāngléi** clan, was called **Nǚjié**. She conceived **Shàohào**, known as the **Qīngyáng** clan, by sensing the **Tāiguāng** (Celestial Radiance) piercing the sun.

**Shàohào’s** secondary wife, named **Xiūfáng**, bore **Dàyè**. **Dàyè’s** wife, named **Fūshǐ**, conceived **Gāoxiàn** by sensing the **white clouds** enveloping her. **Gāoxiàn** bore **Bóyì**, also known as **Yì**. The **Emperor Shùn**封封 him at **Yíng**, and thus he took the surname **Léi** (as **Yíng** was transformed into **Léi**).

**Yì’s** wife, **Yáo**, bore **Ruòshuǐ**, who bore **Chāngguì**, who bore **Jǐngpú**, who bore **Zhòngxíng**. **Zhòngxíng** served as a vassal of the **Zhōu Chéngwáng**, and was posthumously named **Fēigōng**.

By the time of **Emperor Xuānwáng**, he was granted the surname **Kēi**. **Kēi’s** grandson, **Tíngjiān**, had a daughter, **Zhēnjié**, who remained unwedded in her chastity. Residing in **Làxiāng**’s **Rénlǐ** hamlet of the **Chǔ** realm, she ate **Lǐ** fruit and conceived. After **eighty-one years**, she bore without suffering, and divine spirits subtly guarded her. On the **fifteenth day of the second month** during the reign of **King Huì of Zhōu**, while climbing a **Lǐ** tree, she gave birth from her **left flank**.

The child was born with **white hair**, and in his **left palm** was a **jade seal** with a character, while in his **right palm** were **seventy-two volumes of scripture** with characters. Beneath his **left foot** was the character **jiù** (救, *rescue*), and beneath his **right foot** was the character **zhì** (治, *govern*). He could speak upon birth and asked his father where he was.

His mother answered: *"I have remained chaste and unwedded, and now I am old. I conceived by eating the **Lǐ** fruit, so you have no father. I bore you as a maiden, fearing ridicule from our neighbors. I wanted to drink poison and end myself, but a divine being warned me not to swallow the medicine. Now, eighty-one years have passed. You were born from the **Lǐ** fruit, so **Lǐ** shall be your surname."* Though she was aged, he was called **Lǎozi** (老子).

**Lǎozi** composed the **seventy-two canons** to record the names of **Heaven, Earth, and the spirits**, and expounded the **Dao of effortless longevity**. He wedded the daughter of the **Yīn** clan from **Tiānshuǐ**, and bore a son named **Zhēnlì**, who would later serve as **Jìngdìng’s** teacher—this is one account.

Now, **Yǐnxǐ** was a minister of **Kāngwáng** and served as the **Guān** prefect during **Zhāowáng’s** reign. **Lǎojūn** had already crossed the **Guān** pass and transmitted the **scriptures**, so the timeline and order differ. Though the lineage records may be in error, the origin of the **Lǐ** surname is still documented here.

The *Transmission of the Mysterious Jade Maiden Yuanjun* states: In Heaven, **Lǎojūn** was revered as the **Celestial Sage**, and long before the **eon**, he began his teachings. With the **Dao of effortless persistence**, he transformed among **Heaven and humanity**. He was the sovereign of all **sages** before the **eon**, and thus the **Celestial Sage, Dao Emperor** granted him his true title: **Lǎojūn**.

Even before the **Five Celestial Sovereigns**, he bore this name through the **eons**. Though his teachings were passed down through generations as the **preceptor of emperors**, he had not yet descended to the mortal realm. At the **Nine Pure** (highest celestial realm), the **Mysterious Jade Maiden** was commanded to descend to earth as the daughter of the **Yīn** clan from **Tiānshuǐ**, and marry **Lǐ Língfēi**.

**Lǎojūn** then rode upon the **essence of the sun**, driving **Nine Dragons**, and transformed into a **five-colored pearl**, descending into the **Mysterious Jade Maiden’s** mouth, where he took root and gestated for **eighty-one years**. Climbing the **Lǐ** tree, she bore **Lǎojūn** from her **left flank**. During her pregnancy, divine spirits guarded the **sage-mother**. After his birth, the **Jade Maiden** cradled him, and **auspicious clouds** filled the courtyard, while **sun-children** scattered their radiance, and **Moon Empress** cast her flowers. All **sages** gathered.

**Lǎojūn** then pointed to the **Lǐ** tree and said: *"This is my surname."* He had **nine names** among mortals:
1. **Ēr** (耳), with the style **Bóyáng**.
2. **Yǎ** (雅), with the style **Bózōng**.
3. **Zhōng** (忠), with the style **Bóguāng**.
4. **Shí** (石), with the style **Mènggōng**.
5. **Zhòng** (重), with the style **Zǐwén**.
6. **Dìng** (定), with the style **Yuányáng**.
7. **Yuán** (元), with the style **Bóshǐ**.
8. **Xiǎn** (显), with the style **Yuánshēng**.
9. **Dé** (德), with the style **Bówén**.

Some say he had **thirty-six titles**, others claim **seventy-two names**, or that his names and styles are countless, spanning **eon to eon** beyond mortal record. **Lǎojūn** possessed **nine transformations**, mirroring the **Law of the Sun’s** generative function. He had **seventy-two forms** and **eighty-one virtues**, thus making him the **sage among sages**, the **true among truths**.

The **Sage-Mother** in Heaven was called the **Mysterious Jade Maiden**. After giving birth to the **Great Sage**, she became the **Tāiyī Yuánjūn** (太一元君). **Yuánjūn** then instructed **Lǎojūn** on the purpose of his descent to teach mortals. Within the **Nine Chambers of Three Unity** (内修九室三一之门), she observed the **precepts of ten thousand virtues and ten thousand evils**, the **formulas of a hundred diseases and a hundred remedies**, the **rules of emptiness and purity**, and the **refinements of the nine elixirs**. She intended to reveal these to humanity, establishing a **transmission of teachings from master to disciple**.

Yet, the **Supreme Sage of the Highest Dao** (太上大圣) was the **master of all transformations**—why would he await instruction from a teacher? After completing his **Dao**, celestial music resounded through the void, and **auspicious clouds** veiled the wilds. **Ten thousand chariots and a hundred thousand riders**, along with the **Five Emperors and the Highest Truths**, surrounded the **Nine-Light Eight-Banner** carriage, welcoming **Yuánjūn** back to the **Jade Pure** realm. Henceforth, she was the **Tāiyī Yuánjūn**.

The **Song dynasty** (国朝) honored her as the **Primordial Empress**. The details are as previously explained, and further accounts appear in other texts. The **Sage-Mother’s** original descent was as the **Mysterious Jade Maiden**, **Lǎojūn’s** mother, and her deeds as **Tāiyī Yuánjūn** were most authentic. The **Song dynasty’s** veneration, however, identifies **Mǔ Yìshòu** (母益寿氏) as the **Primordial Empress**, as clearly stated in the lineage records. No such account is found in **Dao scriptures**, and the birth era is traditionally placed during the reign of **Yīn Wǔdīng**. Other accounts vary, with discrepancies in timing and details, and thus are not adopted here.

**The Twenty-Ninth [Section]:** Those who **prospers the Emperor’s lineage**. **Lǎojūn’s** **Dao** encompasses all existence, and its blessings extend to all **Heavenly Beings**. He passed down his **virtue** to his descendants, and his **light** shone upon the **Great Treasure**. Thus, his **thirty-first generation** descendant, **High Ancestor Shényáo**, illuminated the **land** and **founded the Tang dynasty**.

The **Heavenly Manifestation** flows with **auspicious grace**, its source from the **Upper Pure** (上清). The **Jade Sea’s** clarity radiates, nurturing all within the **Ten Thousand Abodes**.

**The Thirtieth [Section]: Those Who Record the Great Name**

The Emperor of **Virtue-Brightness** aided **Yáo** and assisted **Shùn**, while the **Holy Emperor** grasped the **sacred calendar** and acted in due time.
His **light** first shone between **Táng** and **Yú**, then flourished anew in the **Qín** and **Liáng** lands.
Compared to the **virtue** of **Hòuxì** and **Ancient Gōng**, or the **ascendancy** of **Wénchāng** and **Wǔfā**, divining succession and reign—his imperial lineage, branch and leaf, was no less noble than that of the **Ji-Zhōu**.

**The Thirty-First [Section]: Those Who Bear the Auspicious Title**

Now, it is made clear below.
In the first year of **Jiānfēng**, the **sacred title** was bestowed.
Previously, the two characters **"Lǎo"** and **"Zǐ"** were broadly interpreted across the **Thirty Gates**, to manifest the **omens** and bestow the **title**.

**Explication of the Sacred Title "Tàishàng Lǎojūn"**
The term **"Tàishàng"** is the **sublime name** of the **Universal Teaching**, the **ultimate fruit of sainthood**.
**"Tài"** means **"Great"**, and **"Shàng"** means **"High"**.
**"Tài"**—none surpasses the **Greatness of Tàishàng**.
**"Shàng"**—none exceeds the **Height of Shàng**.
Thus, **"Tàishàng"** is the **ultimate designation** of **cultivation’s cause and enlightenment’s fruit**.
Mortals who practice attain **Dao** from **ordinariness**, **immortality** from **Dao**, **veritable reality** from **immortality**, and **sainthood** from **veritable reality**.
The **highest stage of sainthood** ascends to **Tàishàng**.
**Tàishàng** possesses **six transcendences** and **ten thousand virtues**, none lacking.
He inherits the **Law’s sovereign throne**, governing all **saints**, and thus attains this **sublime station**.
His name, like that of the **Emperors of each dynasty**, is passed down through succession, all bearing the title.

Since **Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn**, there have been:
**Tàishàng Dàdào Jūn**, **Tàishàng Lǎojūn**, **Tàishàng Zhàngrén**, and **Tàishàng Gāohuángdì**—all attaining this **ultimate rank**.
Yet **Tàishàng Zhàngrén** and **Gāohuángdì**, though bearing the **sublime title**, did not propagate the **Teaching**.
Only **Dàodào Jūn** and **Lǎojūn** transmitted the **imperial lineage** and became **sovereigns of the Ten Thousand Heavens**.

**"Xuán"** means **profound**, **wondrous**, and also **Dao**, **Heaven**.
The **Supreme Dao** is too high and subtle for speech.
Condensing the **profound** and the **wondrous**, **"Xuán"** serves as its **manifestation**, declaring the **profound, wondrous, and distant** to illuminate the **Dao’s essence**.
Thus, it is called **"Xuányuán"**—**Origin**, **Beginning**, **Ancestor**.
*The **Ěryǎ** states:* **"The root of the Dao’s emergence, the ancestral source of all things."**
Both **worldly** and **transcendent** methods stem from this **foundation**.
Hence, it is called **"Yuánhuáng"**—**"Great"** refers to the **Great Dao**; the **Dao**, when great, is called **"Huáng"**.
*The **Preface to the *Shàngshū*** says:* **"The writings of the Three Sovereigns are called *Sānfén*."**
This speaks of the **Great Dao**.
**"Dì"** means **Heaven**; his **virtue** aligns with **Heaven**, second only to the **Dao**.
**"Great virtue"** is called **"Dì"**; combining **virtue** and **Dao**, it is termed **"Huángdì"**.
It is also said: **"Following the Dao and conforming to Heaven"**—thus, **"Huángdì"**.
When **Qín Shǐhuáng** unified the world and established laws for posterity, he adopted the **sublime names** of the **Three Sovereigns** and the **beautiful titles** of the **Five Emperors**, combining them as **"Huángdì"**.
*The **Preface to the *Shàngshū*** says:* **"The writings of the Five Emperors are called *Wǔdiǎn*."**
This speaks of the **constant Dao**.

**"Nèihào"** is the **hidden name**.
**Lǎojūn** has **ten thousand names and titles**, too numerous to exhaust.
At that time, the world called him **"Lǎozǐ"**.
This was due to the **Dao’s eminence** and **virtue’s nobility**, making it improper to name him directly.
Both **Heaven** and **mankind** reverently called him **"Lǎozǐ"**—this was his **hidden name**.

Our **Great Tang Emperor Gāozōng Tiānhuángdì**, the **thirty-third sacred descendant** of **Lǎozǐ**, was the **third son** of **Tàizōng Wénhuángdì**, the **third emperor of Great Tang**.
He inherited the **peaceful succession**, grasped the **sacred calendar**, and displayed the **numinous brilliance** of the **Immortal Lǐ**.
He expanded the **auspicious rites of prosperity**, returned to the **capital from Gùxìan**, and paid homage to the **Sacred True Source**.
He demonstrated **filial piety** in honoring the **ancestors** and **elevated the Sacred Title** of **Xuányuán**.
In the first year of **Jiānfēng**, on the **twenty-eighth day of the second lunar month**, in the year of **Bingyín**, he issued a decree:

*"The **Great Dao** of the **Eastern Platform** blends into unity, established before **Yīn** and **Yáng**.
The **Perfect Man**, emptying himself, speaks of **ten thousand things** with subtlety.
As for **Lǎojūn**, he is my **original lineage**.
From **Fúxī’s** beginning to the **end of the Ji-Zhōu**, his **numinous responses** were formless, his **transformations** manifold.
He ascended beyond **Yuánqì**, descended through **solar essence**, sometimes drifting through the cosmos, inhaling and exhaling **wind and clouds**, sometimes instructing and befriending **emperors**, his **divine brushstrokes** immortal.
Like **Yīn** and **Yáng**, he was unfathomable; with **sun and moon**, he hung suspended.
During the **Jīnxīng** period, he concealed his traces beneath the **pillars**, expounding **elegant teachings** and setting examples for future ages.
Though his **heart aligned with the Great Void**, his **principles returned to the True Sovereign**.
As for those who **abandon sainthood and discard wisdom**, arrange **few desires**, and in the **silent, distant void** surpass **sight and sound**—
**Detached and effortless**, naturally content,
**Drawn upon without depletion**, used without exhaustion,
**Holding the Great Image** while returning to **primordial purity**,
**Purifying the Mysterious Mirror** and casting off **entanglements**,
**Transcending Heaven and Earth** to endure eternally,
**Straddling the Potter’s Wheel** to nurture all—
**How sublime!**
Indeed, he is beyond all naming."*

The **Supreme Sage’s** blessings were indeed abundant, his **virtue/power** flourishing with boundless fortune.
The **highest virtue** walked its path, truly entering an age of auspicious repose.

I, inheriting the sacred mandate, govern the myriad myriads with reverent care.
Guiding the luminaries of **San Guang** [Sun, Moon, Stars], I rise in solemn awe at dawn’s first light,
Bearing the weight of the **Four Great Elements**, yet rest with vigilant dread.
I exhaust my **filial piety and respect** toward my ancestral roots,
And pour forth boundless kindness to both the living and the departed.

I uphold the **pure and virtuous transformation**, continuing the **Great Peace’s** legacy.
Ascending the **Jie Hill** to display my **auspicious omens**, seated in the **Bright Court** to receive my **destined title**—
Smoke ascends in celebration, and blessings descend in abundance;
The **Nine Ghosts** of the **Gao** respond with cranes, while mountains proclaim **Ten Thousand Years**.
Exceeding ancient precedents in **auspicious signs**, surpassing even the **Emperors of old** as the foremost sovereign.

With the **Great Rites** now complete, I return my carriage to the capital,
Taking a circuitous route through **Lai Village**, personally offering **sacrificial wine** to the **Sacred Precincts**,
Gazing upward at the **auspicious cypress** in lingering reverence,
And drawing from the **Divine Spring** in eternal sigh.

My thoughts of his enduring presence grow ever deeper,
And my reverence for the **beginning of respect** grows ever more profound.

It is fitting to proclaim the **mystic origins** of his essence,
Thus illuminating the **play of the Mysterious Sage’s** **virtue/power**.

Therefore, I decree his posthumous title as **Emperor Xuanyuan** [玄元皇帝].
Moreover, let **Guyang County** be renamed **Zhenyuan County**,
And grant the county’s **sacred lineage** an additional year of tax exemption.
May this honor the **loyal and reverent devotion**, fulfilling the **duty to venerate the ancestors**.

Proclaim this edict to all within and without,
That all may know.

The Sovereign shall implement this decree.

Moreover, in the second year of **Yongchun** [永淳], on the fourth day of the twelfth month, the **Emperor** issued an edict:

*"The **Way/Dao** is revered by the **Sovereign**,
And his abode is beneath the **Purple Enclosure** [紫微], from which his teachings descend.*

*The **virtue/power** of the **ministers** is cultivated,
And their **loyal hearts** [丹心] are exhausted in polishing themselves.*

*If the **superior** upholds **righteousness/義** [义],
And the **inferior** honors **propriety/禮** [礼],
Then **naming and teaching** [名教] shall flow in purity,
And **loyalty and trustworthiness** [忠信] shall grow ever more refined.*

*In ancient times, the **Buxu Court** [胥庭] was vast and boundless,
And **Nüwa** and **Fuxi** transformed the world without slaughter.*

*Even **Xuanyuan** [轩顼] of **Emperor Yao** and **Emperor Shun**,
Though their governance was just, their **deep benevolence** [深仁] still accumulated.*

*Yet when **Qin** seized the **Son of Heaven’s position** [润位],
The **decadent and extravagant** [奢泰] trends began to flourish,
And when **Han** inherited the **conqueror’s schemes** [霸图],
The **mystic and humble** [玄默] customs were already in decline.*

*Looking far to the **Wei** and **Jin** dynasties,
And near to the **Northern Zhou** and **Sui**,
The **age** [代] grew ever more chaotic,
And the **people** [人] indulged in **usurpation and excess** [僭侈].*

*Examining the **corruptions** of a hundred **Sovereigns** [百王],
And the **calamitous trends** of a thousand years,
After the **Great Disorder** [大乱],
Now arises the **Great Sage’s** [大圣] **era** [期].*

*Having surpassed the **time of mourning** [交丧],
It is necessary to foster the **harmonious succession** [交泰] of **virtue/power**.*

*My **High Ancestor**, the **Divine Sage Emperor** [神尧皇帝],
Received the **august mandate** [景命] from the **Palace of the Son of Heaven** [镳宫],
And dispelled the **wild and chaotic** [妖氛] of the **outer lands** [野].
He **reestablished** the **heavenly luminaries** [日月],
And **rectified** the **four quarters** [宇宙] of the world.*

*The **Great Sage Emperor** [太宗文皇帝],
Unfurled the **map** [图] at the **Yellow River** [汶水],
And wielded the **great axe** [钺] across the **four directions** [参墟].
He **descended** the **divine celestial troops** [斗极神兵],
And **cleansed** the **great flood** [巨浸] of **Huai and Xiang** [怀襄].
He **extended** the **four cardinal directions** [四维],
And **secured** the **Red Land** [赤县].
Through **countless battles** [百战],
He **sacrificed** for the **people** [苍生].
His **teachings and influence** [声教] spread far,
And his **boundaries and protection** [堤封] extended afar.
His **grand achievements** [洪业] are vast,
And none can equal them.*

*With my **limited understanding** [寡昧],
I **shamefully inherit** [忝膺] the **great legacy** [丕绪],
Yet never have I ceased to **diligently seek the Dao/Way** [访道],
And **tremble at my responsibilities** [临人].
Each day I am more cautious than the last,
And **thirty-four years** [三十四载] have now passed.

*Moreover, when the **people below are at ease** [下安],
Then the **Sovereign above rests** [上逸],
And when the **times are corrupt** [时弊],
The **Sovereign’s** [君] **concerns multiply** [忧].
Though I reside in the **ninefold palace** [九重],
My **care extends to all the people** [万姓].

*My **resolve to establish the foundation** [建本之怀] grows ever stronger,
And my **restraint toward superficial matters** [抑末] **is now profound** [念遽深].
Though the **people’s affairs** [庶绩] are settled,
The **pure origins** [淳源] of the **Way/Dao** are not yet fully realized.*

*My **lineage** [绵系] **traces back** to **Xuanyuan Emperor** [玄元].
I **constantly desire** to **extend** [远叶] the **ancestral rules** [先规],
And **propagate** the **Dao/Way’s** **transformations** [道化].
To **change the land** into a **domain of longevity** [寿域],
And to **deliver the people** to a **forest of blessings** [福林].

*Reflecting upon the **Land of Harmony** [华胥],
And **laboring in my dreams** [寤寐],
I **hope** that all within and without the **court** [内外寮寀]
Shall **exhaust their sincerity** [竭乃诚],
And **encourage** the **virtuous** [梨萌] to **revere simplicity** [简质].
Those **tainted by old customs** [旧染] shall **abandon corrupt trends** [薄俗],
And **all shall return to the new** [惟新].
Relying on the **Great Dao/Way** [大道],
We **usher in the beginning** [开元],
And **together renew the world** [更始].

*It is fitting to **broaden** the **imperial grace** [霈泽],
And **extend** its **far-reaching blessings** [绂埏].
Therefore, I **grant a great amnesty** [大赦] to all under heaven,
And rename the second year of **Yongchun** [永淳] as the first year of **Hongdao** [弘道].

*Furthermore, I command all states across the land to establish **Dao/Way Observatories** [道干观],
Three in the **upper states** [上州],
Two in the **middle states** [中州],
And one in the **lower states** [下州].
Each observatory shall **ordain** [度] seven **Daoists** [道士],
To **manifest** the **wind of purity** [清净之风],
And to **await** the **harmonious transformations** of the **Dao/Way’s** **non-action** [无为之化].

The Sovereign shall implement this decree.
Thus, it fulfills the **intent to honor the ancestors and venerate the first** [奉先尊祖],
And to **return to simplicity and purity** [复朴还淳].

**The Second Scroll of *The Daoist Classic with Grand Explanations of the Sages’ Meaning*** [道德真经广圣义卷之二] is complete.
**The Third Scroll of *The Daoist Classic with Grand Explanations of the Sages’ Meaning*** [道德真经广圣义卷之三] is complete.

**Tang Master Guangcheng Du Guangting’s *Exposition on the Imperial Commentary—Preface to the Commentary (Upper Section)***

**Commentary:**
The **Supreme Dao/Way’s Root** [玄玄道宗] descended and took birth in **Yimò** [伊亳].

**Explanation:**
*"Xuan"* [玄] means profound and mysterious, also unobstructed.
*"Zong"* [宗] means master, also revered.
It speaks of **Laozi, the Venerable Lord on High**, as the master of the profound and mysterious Dao/Way.

Since the Venerable Lord on High is neither bound to existence nor to non-existence,
He transcends both cause and effect, casting off both coarse and refined.
As the **Primordial Sovereign** [先天] and **Posterior Sovereign** [后天] of the kalpas,
He is revered as the **Teaching Sovereign** [教主], hence the term **Supreme Dao/Way’s Root**.

*"Jiangsheng"* [降生]—from above to below is called *jiang* [降].
It means the Venerable Lord on High, dwelling in the **Three Realms’ Heaven** [三境之天],
as the master of the Great Dao/Way, out of compassion for the mortal realm,
descended to manifest in the human world.
With boundless mercy, He assumed a form and displayed auspicious signs—
riding the **Nine Dragons’ Chariot** [九龙之驾],
transforming the essence of the **Morning Sun** [旭日],
entering the dream of the **Mysterious Jade Maiden** [玄妙玉女],
thus taking human form through her conception and birth into the world.
To demonstrate His kinship with the common folk,
He took on the appearance of birth,
marking the beginning of His manifestation.
Hence, it is called *"descended birth"* [降生].
This clarifies His manifestation at the threshold of transformation.

**Yimò** [伊亳]:
*"Yi"* [伊] refers to the ruins of **Yihou** [伊侯], where the Venerable Lord’s ancestor fled to avoid the tyranny of **Jie** [桀].
This land lies between the cities of **Ku** [苦] and **Xiang** [相].

*"Mò"* [亳] refers to the **Mò Society’s land** [亳社之地], anciently called **Mò** [亳], later known as the **ruins of Yin** [殷墟].
From **King Tang’s** [汤] receipt of the Mandate of Heaven to the **nineteenth Yin king, Pan Geng** [盘庚],
who relocated the capital eight times before finally establishing it at **Mò**—this was the capital of Yin.
Some say it was the state of **Chen** [陈], the descendants of **Taixu** [太皡]’s lineage,
called **Chen Ruins** [陈墟], located beside **Ruan Hill** [宛丘].

According to the **Nine Provinces divided by Yu** [禹别九州],
**Ku County** [苦县] was part of **Yuzhou** [豫州].
After **King Wu’s** [武王] conquest of **Zhou** [纣],
he granted **Hupang Man** [胡公满], a descendant of **Shun** [舜], the state of **Chen**.
This was the ancient lineage of **Taixu’s** descendants, already ruling **Chen**.
The descendants of **Shun** had also become the **Hu State** [胡国].
**Hu** was small, while **Chen** was large;
**Hu** lay between **Shen and Cai** [沈蔡之间],
while **Chen** was in present-day **Yingchuan** [颖川].
**King Wu**, honoring **Shun’s virtue** [舜德],
rewarded his descendants by relocating them to **Chen**.
From **Hupang Man** onward, through the **Spring and Autumn Period** [春秋],
**Chen** endured for over forty generations before being conquered by **Chu’s heir** [楚子].
When **Han Gaozu** [汉祖] destroyed **Qin**,
he renamed **Chen** as **Huaiyang Commandery** [淮阳郡].
Since commanderies were large and counties small,
and counties were administered by commanderies,
**Huaiyang** encompassed the four counties of **Yangxia** [阳夏],
**Ningping** [宁平], **Ruò** [若], and **Zhè** [柘].
Later, **Emperor Zhang of the Later Han** [后汉章帝] renamed **Huaiyang** as **Chen Commandery** [陈郡].

Some say it was the state of **Chu** [楚],
with **Xiong Yi** [熊绎] as its first ruler, whose capital was at **Jing** [荆].
**Chen**, though separated by the **Huai River** [淮],
shared borders with **Chu**.
During the **Spring and Autumn Period**,
**Chu’s heir** conquered **Chen** and annexed it as a county,
thus making it part of **Chu**, and it became **Chu territory**.

Some say **Chu County** [楚县], others say **Chen Commandery** [陈郡].
In the **Spring and Autumn Period**, commanderies were small while counties were large,
so commanderies were subordinate to counties—hence **Chu County**.
When **Qin** unified **Chu County**,
it established **thirty-six commanderies**, making commanderies large and counties small,
so counties were subordinate to commanderies—hence **Chu County**.

Some say **Qiao State** [谯国]:
Today, **Laozi’s former residence**, **Taqing Palace** [太清宫], has **Qiao City** [谯城] forty *li* northeast of it.

Some say **Xiangren** [相人]:
Beside the palace lies the ancient city of **Xiang** [相城].

Some say **Ku County** [苦县] was also a **Spring and Autumn-era administrative county** [春秋统郡之县].
Thus, **Ku County’s** city stood east of the **Lai River** [濑水], its foundations still extant.
Later, **Ku County** was renamed **Guyang County** [谷阳县].

In **Tang Emperor Gaozong’s** [高宗] **Kianyun Year 1** [乾封元年],
he ascended **Mount Tai** [东岳] and, upon his return,
visited **Laozi’s former residence**, bestowing an imperial title and renaming the county **Zhenyuan** [真源县].

In **Tianhe Year 3** [中和三年], on the **gengmǎo year** [癸卯],
**Magistrate Pan Chou** [潘稠] of **Mò Prefecture** [亳州] submitted a memorial to the **Imperial Court in Chengdu** [成都行在],
stating that **Taqing Palace** had repeatedly demonstrated miraculous signs.
Since the **Huang Chao Rebellion** [黄巢大寇],
bandits had attacked eighteen times,
yet each time, **thunderous winds** [迅雷烈风] struck them,
causing them to stumble and lose their way,
or suffer utter defeat—none dared approach the palace.
Thousands of nearby residents took refuge there and survived unharmed.
He requested relocating the county to the palace grounds for protection.
The Emperor decreed that, though the request was well-intentioned,
moving the county would profane sacred ground,
and thus it was not permitted.
Instead, **Zhenyuan County** was elevated to **Chì County** [赤县],
since **Taqing Palace** lay within its jurisdiction.
An imperial envoy was dispatched to perform **ritual fasting and prayers** [斋御词修斋告谢].

Though ages have passed and names have changed,
the origins of these places remain the same.

The **Later Han Emperor Huan** dreamed of **Laozi**, and by imperial decree summoned **Chen Xiang’s** official **Bian Shao** to construct a shrine and erect a stele at the **Master’s** birthplace and ancestral home. Beside the shrine stood the **Temple of Lady Li**, and within the shrine, there was an ancient **Hall of Emptiness-Nothingness**. Before the hall grew three **Chinese windmill pines** [桧] and a thousand additional pines, the **Nine Dragon Well**, the **Alchemical Elixir Well**, and the **Ascension Deer-Track Tree**. These ancient traces remain unchanged.

To its left flows the **Spiritual Stream** [灵溪], and to its right encircles the **Swirling Water** [涡水]. The site is open and splendid, truly a **venerable location**.

The **Lai Water** flows to the west of the palace, and since water names the district, it is known as **Lai County**. Some call it **Li County** [厉乡], but this is a textual error.

Across generations, successive emperors and kings have repeatedly embellished this estate. In the **sixth year of Emperor Wen’s reign in the Sui Dynasty**, the **Sui Emperor Wen** ordered **Xue Daoheng**, the **Inner Historian’s Attendant**, to erect a stele and restore the temple. In the **seventh year of Tianbao** [天宝七年], in the year **Wuzhi** [戊子], the **Taqing Palace** was renamed, with the **Sammyan Prefect of Bianzhou** appointed as its **Palace Attendant** and the **Magistrate of Bozhou** as its **Deputy Attendant**. The **six sacred statues** of the **Later Zhou Dynasty**—the **Highest Ancestors** of **Emperor Gaozu, Emperor Taizong, Emperor Gaozong, Emperor Zhongzong, Emperor Ruizong, and Emperor Xuanzong**—were all enshrined to serve at **Laozi’s** side.

**Commentary:** *"Awe-inspiring, the august Ancestor,
ordained the surname of our Tang."*
**Explanation:** *"Awe-inspiring"* [肃肃] denotes **reverence, solemnity, and respect**. *"August"* [皇] means **great**. *"Ancestor"* [祖] refers to the **origin**. Thus, **Laozi** is the **revered and august origin** of the **Great Tang Dynasty**. *"Ordained the surname"* [命氏] pertains to **clan lineage**, explaining the **source of the surname**. *"Our Tang"* [我唐] signifies that the **establishment of the Tang Dynasty** began with the **sacred Ancestors’ blessings**, making **Laozi** their **descendant**. Initially, **Laozi’s surname was derived from pointing at a **plum tree** [李树], as the **origin of the Li surname** is already detailed in the previous **Explanation of Meaning**.*

Thus, it is said: *"The surname of our Tang was ordained."* The **Xue Daoheng Stele** states: *"Twice born from the sun’s radiance,
ineffable source of the received **qi**."*
Pointing to the tree as the surname’s origin remains unclear; **Laozi’s** lineage was established by **Zhang Yansheng** [京房] through **wind-and-reed divination** [吹律].

**Commentary:** *"The blessings of the august Ancestor,
endless and far-reaching."*
**Explanation:** *"Blessings"* [裕] means **bestowing virtue upon the worthy**. *"Endless"* [无疆] describes **boundless expanse and vastness**. *"Far-reaching"* [祉] is **blessing**. **Laozi’s** virtue nurtures **endless blessings**, spreading **vast and enduring prosperity**, illuminating the **imperial enterprise** and **reviving our Great Tang**. *"Blessings"* [垂裕] also means **teaching and guidance**.

**Commentary:** *"In the **Long Hair** ode, the **auspicious signs** endure,
rooted in the **ancestral lineage** of **bottle gourd and calabash**."*
**Explanation:** *"Long Hair"* [《长发》] is a **poem from the Shang Dynasty**, recorded in the **Book of Songs**. *"The virtuous and wise King of Shang,
his long hair marked by **auspicious signs**."* *"Auspicious signs"* [祥] means **virtue**. It states that the **virtue of the Shang clan**, through **longstanding manifestations of good fortune**, aligned with the **Five Teachings**, demonstrating **benevolent and expansive virtue**—the **initial portents of their sovereignty**. From the **Yu, Xia, and Shang dynasties**, **Tang** gained the **Mandate of Heaven**, and the **Tang lineage endured unbroken**. *"Bottle gourd and calabash"* [瓜瓞] refers to the **poem *The Descendants of King Wen*** [《文王之什□绵绵篇》], where *"bottle gourd"* [瓜] symbolizes **successive generations**, while *"calabash"* [瓞] represents **the unbroken transmission of virtue**. The **bottle gourd’s** fruit **inherits its predecessor’s form**, and the **calabash’s** young shoots **resemble the older ones**, thus *"bottle gourd and calabash"* [瓜瓞] signifies **unbroken continuity**, like the **enduring virtue of the later generations**. **Houji**, the **earliest ancestor of the Zhou clan**, was **enshrined at Tai** [邰], but later **Duke Liu** lost his position and **migrated to Bin** [豳], dwelling at **Qizi** [漆沮]. His **virtue endured**, flourishing under **King Wen of Zhou**, who won the **people’s hearts** and **established the Zhou Dynasty**. This recounts the **long-lasting rise of the Yin and Zhou dynasties** to illustrate **Laozi’s** enduring blessings. The **Tang Dynasty’s** ascension, too, was **not the work of a single day or night**; it was **accumulated virtue and transmitted blessings**, a **process stretching far back**, that enabled it to **seize the Mandate of Heaven**, just as the **Yin and Zhou dynasties** had done.

**Commentary:** *"Its traces of origin and lineage
are now fully recorded in the registers."*
**Explanation:** *"Now"* [方] refers to **current records**; *"registers"* [册] are **bamboo-bound annals**, measuring **two inches longer than a foot**, used to **document state affairs**. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: *"Major events are inscribed in registers,
minor ones in slips of bamboo."* *"Origin"* [出] signifies **public service**, such as **Laozi’s descendants** serving as **national tutors**, **keepers of archives**, **pillar historians**, **grand historians**, or as **Master Yang’s father** [伯阳父], all **distinguished in the imperial court**. *"Lineage"* [处] denotes **seclusion and retreat**, such as **Laozi’s guidance in the western deserts**, **eastern pilgrimages to the azure seas**, and **hidden transmission of scriptures**. Though **obscure in name and withdrawn from the world**, his **conduct and influence**, his **transformative guidance**, are **fully chronicled** in the **official histories**, **bamboo registers**, and **Daoist classics**.

The *I Ching* says: *"Sometimes it emerges, sometimes it retreats"*—this is the case.

**Commentary:** *"The Daoist school holds that **jade mornings** [玉晨] correspond to **Laozi’s** title."*
**Explanation:** *"Daoist school"* [道家] follows **Sima Qian’s** classification in *Six Schools*, where **Daoism precedes the Six Classics**. Among them, **Daoism is the most refined and harmonious**. **Sima Qian** said: *"Yin-Yang is elaborate yet perplexing,
Confucianism is extensive yet burdensome,
Mohism is arduous yet stifling,
Naming is ornate yet shallow,
Legalism is harsh yet lacking compassion.
Only **Daoism** embodies the **Great Way**."* Its **teaching is pure and effortless**, allowing **the mind to focus**, **actions to align with the unseen**, and **all things to flourish**. Its **practice** follows **Yin-Yang** to **achieve great harmony**, **adapts to the times**, **responds to phenomena**, and **transforms with them**—always fitting. **Simple yet profound**, **few in precepts yet vast in effect**, its **principles are easy to enact**, its **language difficult to grasp**. Rooted in **Emptiness-Nothingness**, it **relies on natural flow**, without fixed **forms or rigid structures**, thus **penetrating the essence of all things**. Neither **preceding nor following**, it **stands as the sovereign of all things**. This is what is meant by **Daoism**.

The *Huainanzi* states: *"**Daoism** governs **reason and emotion**,
harmonizes **mind and method**,
maintains **equilibrium and appropriateness**,
finds joy in the **Way** and forgets **humiliation**,
cherishes **virtue** and endures **poverty**."*

The **venerable sages** hold it in highest esteem,
the **foundation of states and families** relies upon it.
Thus it is called **Daoism**.

**Yùchén** is another appellation of the **Supreme Dao/Way Lord**.
*The Old Lord’s Biography* states:
Some call him **Celestial Venerable**,
some call him **Supreme Venerable**,
some call him **Great Dao**,
some call him **Old Lord**.
Thus, **Yùchén Lord** is also an appellation of the Old Lord.
The **Supreme Void Emperor** (Xūhuáng) dwells in the **Purple Jade Palace**,
above **Mysterious Capital, Jade Metropolis** (Xuándū Yùjīng),
also named the **Purple Dawn Palace**,
also named the **Jade Dawn Palace**—
this is the **Yùchén Dao Lord**, another name for the Old Lord.

**Annotation:** *Does Sima Qian call him the "Hidden Gentleman"?*
**Explanation:** Sima Qian—
Surname Sima, given name Qian, courtesy name Zǐcháng,
a native of Wēn, Hénán, grandson of Sīmǎ Xǐ, chancellor to Zhōngshān Wáng,
and son of Tán, the Grand Historian.
Born in Lóngmén, at ten he recited the *Ancient Text Classic of Documents*,
at twenty he wandered through Jiānghuái and Jiǔyí, near Yǔ’s tombs.
He served the Han as a **Lángzhōng** (courtier),
and was dispatched to **Xīshǔ**.
After his father’s death, he became **Grand Historian** and composed *Records of the Grand Historian*.
For speaking in defense of Lǐ Líng, who was falsely accused and his family harmed,
he was slandered, imprisoned, and subjected to **cruel mutilation**.
*The Western Capital Miscellany* says he composed *Records of the Grand Historian* in fury,
and scholars praised his talent as a **fine historian**.
His accounts of **Qū Yuán** and **Jiǎ Yì** were eloquent and expressive—
truly a **great talent of his age**.
Huán Tán’s *New Discourses* states:
*"Sima Qian’s* Records of the Grand Historian *was not yet circulated in his time.
Later, his great-grandson Yáng Róng titled it* The Grand Historian’s Work.
Some say it was named after his ancestor Tán, who held the post of Grand Historian,
and Qian inherited the office, yet suffered mutilation—
fearing disgrace to his ancestors, he took the name of a courier in the Grand Historian’s bureau,
thus calling it* The Grand Historian’s Work *instead."*
Qian died as **Middle Book Order** and left behind **two volumes of collected works**.
*The Records* state:
*"The Old Master sometimes concealed himself, sometimes revealed himself,
for over two hundred years,
then entered the Western Sands and vanished—
truly a **Hidden Gentleman**."*

**Explanation of "Child":**
*"Child"* is an honorific for one of **Dao**.
Ancients called teachers *"Child"*—
as with **Confucius** and **Listed Child** (Lièzǐ).

**Explanation of "Gentleman":**
A **Gentleman** is a **Lord and Teacher**.
*The Records of Rites* says:
*"One who studies must first be broad in analogies,
then can be a teacher.
Only a teacher can be a leader,
only a leader can be a Lord.
As a Lord and Teacher, his **virtue/power** is vast and luminous—
thus he is called a **Gentleman**."*

**Further Explanation:**
*"Though among the common folk, if one is revered for **virtue/power and Dao**,
he is called a **Gentleman**.
Lacking **Dao** and **virtue/power**, even in high station, he is called a **petty man**.*
Thus, **Dao** compares to **Lordship**, **virtue/power** to **teaching**—
only then is he called a **Gentleman**.
All people in the world follow this principle—
how much more so the **Mysterious Primordial Old Lord**,
**Master of Virtue/Power and Dao**, **Teacher of Emperors**,
rightly called a **Gentleman**!"

**Hidden Dragon in lowly station**—
thus called **"Hidden."**

**Annotation:** *Yet Zhòngní revered him.*
**Explanation:** Zhòngní—
Confucius, given name Qíu, courtesy name Zhòngní.
His lineage traced to the descendants of **Yīn**.
According to *Records of the Grand Historian’s* **Yīn Dynasty Biography**:
*"Emperor Yù’s consort swallowed a swallow’s egg and gave birth to **Jié**,
who served Yáo as **Minister of Population**.
For his merits, he was enfeoffed in **Shāng** and granted the surname **Zǐ**.
Jié’s descendant **Tāng**, named Tiānyǐ or Lǚ,
overthrew Xià and became **Son of Heaven**.
By the thirty-seventh generation of Tāng’s descendants,
the king was named **Jīnxīn**, called **Zhòu**,
who ruled without **Dao**—
**Wǔ of Zhōu** raised an army to destroy him,
and enfeoffed his collateral descendant **Wěizǐ’s son Qǐ** in **Sòng**.
Sòng Mǐn Gōng’s son **Fúfǔ Hé** was the eldest and should have inherited,
but he yielded to his younger brother **Lì Gōng**.
Hé’s son was **Sòng Fù Zhōu**, Zhōu’s son was **Shèng**,
Shèng’s son was **Zhèng Kǎofǔ**,
who held three offices in Sòng and was praised in the *Spring and Autumn Annals* for his reverence:
*"One command makes me stoop,
two commands make me bow,
three commands make me kneel.
I cling to the wall and flee—
none dare to insult me.
With three commands, my reverence grows ever greater."*
Zhèng Kǎofǔ’s son was **Kǒng Fù Jiā**,
who branched into the **Kǒng clan**.
Some say: *"He swallowed a yin egg and was later granted the surname Zǐ,
pairing Zǐ with Yǐ (乙), meaning ‘swallow’—thus Kǒng (孔)."*
This is one account.
Another claims the Kǒng surname originated from **dripping water eroding stone**.
This is baseless and rejected here.

Kǒng Fù Jiā served as **Sòng’s Marshal**,
his son was **Mù Jīn Fù**,
Mù Jīn Fù’s son was **Gāoyí Fù**,
Gāoyí Fù’s son was **Fáng Shū**,
who fled to **Lǔ** and fathered **Bó Xià**,
Bó Xià’s son was **Shū Liáng Hé**—
Confucius’s father.

Confucius resided in **Quēlǐ, Zōu Xiāng, Lǔ**.
In the **21st year of King Líng of Zhōu**,
the **22nd year of Duke Xiāng of Lǔ**,
on the **13th day of the 10th month, Gēngshèn**,
he was born.
He died in the **16th year of Duke Aí of Lǔ**,
the **41st year of King Jìng of Zhōu**,
**Gēnshēn year, 18th day of the 4th month**,
at age **73**.

Initially, in the **7th year of Duke Zhāo**,
the **Chu ruler** built **Chénghuá Terrace**,
intending to summon the feudal lords to a feast.
He invited Duke Zhāo, **Mèng Xìzǐ**, and **Zhòngsūn Jué** as escorts,
and proceeded to **Chu**.
In the **3rd month**, they passed through **Chéng**.
Duke Chéng of Chéng honored them,
but Mèng Xìzǐ failed to observe proper etiquette.
Upon arriving in Chu, he could not respond to the **ritual welcome**.
In the **4th month**, the Chu ruler hosted Duke Zhāo at the **New Terrace**.
In the **9th month**, they returned from Chu,
and Mèng Xìzǐ, ill, could not perform the farewell rites.
Thus, he began **teaching**, and those who could follow his **rituals** did so.
In the **24th year**, as Mèng Xìzǐ lay dying,
he called his officials and said:
*"Ritual is the **pillar of humanity**.
Without ritual, one cannot stand.
I have heard that there will arise a **great scholar**—
**Kǒng Qiū**, descendant of a **sage**,
who was exterminated in **Sòng**.
His ancestor **Fúfǔ Hé**, though eldest in Sòng,
yielded the throne to his younger brother **Lì Gōng**.
Later, **Zhèng Kǎofǔ** assisted **Duke Wǔ** and **Duke Xuān**,
and with three commands, his reverence grew ever greater."*

His reverence was thus. Zāng Sūn Xiè said:

*"A sage with manifest virtue,
if his time does not suit him,
his descendants will surely produce a great scholar.
Now, will this great scholar be Kǒng Qiū?
When I die, I entrust [my teachings] to Nángōng Jìngshū.
And to Hé Jì Mèngyìzi—
both are my sons.
As for the Master [Kǒng Qiū],
have them serve him and study ritual,
so that he may establish his station.
Thus, Hé Jì and Jìngshū took Zhòngní as their teacher.

Zhòngní said to Jìngshū:
*'I have heard that Lǎo Dān was well-versed in antiquity and insightful about the present,
mastered the origins of ritual and music,
and understood the ultimate purpose of virtue and the Way.
Thus, he is my teacher.'*

Jìngshū spoke to the Rú ruler:
*'Kǒng Qiū is a descendant of a sage,
and he is the great scholar to come.
He received the command of my late lord,
and I, as his subject, must take him as my teacher.
Now, Confucius is about to travel to Zhōu,
to observe the institutions of the ancient kings,
and examine the ultimate standards of ritual and music—
this is a great undertaking.
My lord, why not provide him with a carriage and provisions?
I request to accompany him.'*

The Rú ruler gave a carriage with two horses, two sets of armor, and Jìngshū went with him to Zhōu.
They inquired about ritual from Lǎo Pèng,
studied music from Cháng Hóng,
inspected the sites of the ancestral altars and suburbs,
examined the models of the Bright Hall,
observed the measures of the court,
and surveyed the four gates of the Bright Hall—
each bore the likenesses of Yáo, Shùn, Jié, and Zhòu,
with their respective virtues and vices,
and the lessons of their rise and fall.
There was also the scene of Zhōu Gōng assisting Chéng Wáng,
carrying him and holding the axe and screen,
facing south to receive the feudal lords.
[Jìngshū] sighed:
*'Now I truly understand Zhōu Gōng’s sagacity
and how Zhōu came to rule.'*

As they prepared to leave Zhōu, Lǎo Jūn sent them off:
*'The wealthy send others away with wealth,
but the virtuous send others away with words.
I claim the title of the virtuous,
so I send you away with words.
All scholars of the age,
though sharp and discerning, are near death—
they delight in criticizing others.
Those who are eloquent and expansive yet perilous—
they delight in exposing others’ faults.
As a subject, one must not presume to act alone.
As a son, one must not presume to act against one’s father.
Since returning from Zhōu, the Master’s Way has grown ever more honored,
and distant disciples have flocked to him—
more than three thousand in number.*

Confucius sighed:
*'Since Nángōng Jìngshū provided me with his carriage,
my Way has flourished.
Otherwise, my Way would have nearly perished.
Now, the *Records of Ritual* that cite what I heard from Lǎo Dān—
these are the essentials of ritual that I learned from my teacher, Lǎo Jūn.*

**Citation:**
*'The *Records of Ritual* say:
*"The Master went west and stored books in the Zhōu archives,
and since Lǎo Jūn had once been the archivist,
he questioned him about them.
Lǎo Jūn refused, so the Master took the Six Classics
and arranged them to please Lǎo Jūn.
Lǎo Jūn said: *"Too chaotic! Let me hear the essentials."
The Master replied:
*"The essentials lie in virtue and righteousness."
Lǎo Jūn asked:
*"Are virtue and righteousness human nature?"
The Master said:
*"Indeed.
A gentleman without virtue cannot stand,
and without righteousness, he cannot live.
Virtue and righteousness are the true nature of the Perfect Man."*

Lǎo Jūn said:
*"Ah, nearly a falsehood!
A mosquito or flea biting the skin
keeps one awake all night.
But virtue and righteousness, cold and stern,
disturb my heart—
no greater chaos exists.
This condemns Confucius for not following the Great Way
but instead adhering to artificiality."*

**Citation:**
*"When the Master asked about ritual, he sighed at the Dragon’s virtue."*

Lǎo Jūn said:
*"A bird does not turn black by avoiding the sun,
nor does a crane turn white by avoiding bathing.
The distinction between black and white is not enough to prove anything,
nor is praise and blame sufficient to broaden one’s perspective.
When a spring dries up, fish gather on the land,
they pant to moisten each other,
they splash to wet each other—
yet this is not as good as forgetting each other in the rivers and lakes.
What you speak of is already the decayed bones of a man,
only his words remain.
A skilled merchant hides his wealth as if empty,
a gentleman of great virtue appears as if foolish.
Abandon your arrogance and excessive desires,
your mannerisms and licentious intentions—
these bring no benefit to your body.
This is what I tell you."*

When Confucius returned, he spoke for three days.
His disciples, puzzled, asked:
*"Master, what did you discuss with Lǎo Dān?"*

Confucius said:
*"When I was in Lǔ with you,
there were those whose intentions soared like flying geese—
I shaped my thoughts like bows and arrows to shoot them down,
and never failed to strike and surpass them.
There were those whose intentions drifted like wandering deer—
I shaped my thoughts like hounds to chase them,
and never failed to overtake and subdue them.
There were those whose intentions sank like fish into the ninefold depths—
I shaped my thoughts like hooks and lines to catch them,
and never failed to retrieve and control them.
But when I saw the Dragon,
I could not comprehend it.
The Dragon, when gathered, forms a complete body;
when dispersed, forms patterns.
It rides the clouds and is nourished by yin and yang,
wandering in the boundless purity—
I could not follow it.
When I saw Lǎo Jūn,
my mouth opened but could not speak,
my tongue extended but could not retract,
my form and spirit were exhausted and confused—
I could not know where I stood.
How could I question Lǎo Dān further?"*

**Citation:**
*"He remained in Zhōu for a long time."*

The *Yì* states:

Lǎo Jūn was born in the year *Gēnchén* (Regnal Year 9) of Emperor Wǔdīng of the Shang Dynasty in Kǔ County, Chu State. By the year *Dīngmǎo* (Regnal Year 21) of King Zhòu, he resided on the southern slopes of Qíshān, where he was known as *Xièyì’s Child*. The Wind Spirit led the way, and Pángzǔ followed as his attendant, to observe the transformations of the Western King. When the Western King heard of this, he summoned him to serve as the Keeper of the Treasury. Lǎo Jūn composed the *Chìjīng Jīng*, teaching the Way of *rén* and *xìn*. The Western King practiced it, honoring the worthy and cherishing virtue, and thus the mountains bowed. Hence, the *Lǐjì* states: *"The rise of the Zhou began at Qíyáng"*—this was the very time. Thereafter, Qíshān became the name of the prefecture, and Fèngxiáng the name of the commandery. This was indeed his work. The place where Lǎo Jūn resided was eighteen *lǐ* north of Fèngxiáng City. After the Tang received the Mandate, it established the *Qǐshèng Gōng* at his former dwelling.

When King Wǔ conquered the Shang, Lǎo Jūn was titled *Yùchéng’s Child* and composed the *Xuánjī Jīng*, which King Wǔ took as his teacher. During King Chéng’s reign, he was called *Jīngchéng’s Child*, and in King Kāng’s reign, *Guōshū’s Child*, still serving as the *Zhùxià Shǐ*. In lowly guise, he aided the Zhou until King Zhāo’s twenty-fifth year, when he crossed the Pass to civilize the Flowing Sands. From the year *Gēnchén* of Wǔdīng to the year *Guǐchǒu* of King Zhāo—two hundred and fifteen years—this is the same as Sīmǎ Qiān’s account of Lǎo Jūn residing in Zhou for over two hundred years.

**Commentary:** *He was about to open the Dao to the Western Extremity.*

The *Běnxiàng Jīng* states: In ancient times, the Wondrous *Fán* Heavenly King, greedy for pleasure and neglecting virtuous deeds, descended to be born as the *Fándúlì* King of *Jí*. Again, he indulged in hunting and slaughter without restraint. Thus, in King Zhāo’s time, Lǎo Jūn entered the Flowing Sands to the west, teaching him the *Fútú* methods and guiding him across.

Moreover, the Western barbarians were licentious and bloodthirsty, practicing perverse illusions and worshipping evil spirits. Lǎo Jūn went among them, transforming eighty-one kings of the Hu and ninety-six kinds of heretical external paths. Hence, it is said he *opened* and *guided* them. *Opening* means enlightening, *guiding* means transforming. The *Western Extremity* refers to the lands west of China—the eighty-one kingdoms of the Flowing Sands and beyond.

**Commentary:** *The Prefect of the Pass, Yìn Xǐ, requested the writing of the scriptures.*

Yìn Xǐ was a native of Tiānshuì, well-versed in the Five Classics, celestial omens, *wéi* divinations, and the books of *yīnyáng*, with none he did not master. Serving the Zhou, he became a minister under King Kāng. By King Zhāo’s twenty-fourth year, knowing that a sage would cross westward, he requested to be appointed Prefect of Hán Gǔ Pass to await Lǎo Jūn’s arrival.

There were eight divisions to this encounter:

1. **Manifesting Auspicious Omens** – In King Zhāo’s time, the *Tiān Lǐ* star moved westward into the constellation *Mǎo*, its true *qi* taking the form of a dragon-serpent, crossing the Han and bringing three gusts of warm wind. Purple clouds hovered over the Pass. Yìn Xǐ, seeing this, requested to be made Prefect to await the sage. The *Xiān Gōng* sequence states: Yìn Xǐ’s fate was bound to the Dao; he foreknew the purple clouds advancing westward and knew a sage would cross.

2. **Testing Yìn Xǐ with Pretenses** – On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, *Rénzǐ* year (King Zhāo’s twenty-fourth year), Lǎo Jūn rode a green ox in a light carriage, with Xú Jiā as his driver, approaching the Pass. He said, *"My home is east of the Pass, my fields west. Tomorrow is the winter solstice; the cold demands firewood."* Yìn Xǐ bowed twice and called himself his disciple, saying, *"Today I see you—you are a sage! I beg you to stay a little longer."* Again, Lǎo Jūn said, *"In the land of Zhú Qián there is an ancient master; I wish to ascend to him."* These were mere pretexts to test Yìn Xǐ.

3. **Transmitting the Dao and Virtue** – The *Dàodé Xù Jué* states: Lǎo Jūn told Yìn Xǐ, *"You should do this: benefit the world, abandon the realm of the worthy, propagate the Great Dao, and you shall become divine and immortal."* On the twenty-eighth day of that month, at noon, he transmitted the *Tàishàng Dàodé Jīng*. Thus, in the year *Guǐchǒu* (King Zhāo’s twenty-fifth year), on the fifth month’s *Rénwǔ* day, he departed Zhou. On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, he crossed the Pass, and on the twenty-eighth day, he transmitted the scripture. From his birth in the year *Gēnchén* of Wǔdīng to the year *Dīngmǎo* when King Wén received the Mandate, this was one hundred and eighty years. From King Zhāo’s twenty-fifth year, *Guǐchǒu*, another one hundred and seventy years—totaling two hundred and fifteen years—when he departed westward and crossed the Pass. The *Shǐjì* states that Lǎozi resided in Dài for over two hundred years before entering the Flowing Sands.

4. **Displaying Divine Powers** – The man who drove Lǎo Jūn’s carriage, Xú Jiā, was originally a withered corpse exposed in the grass. Moved by pity, Lǎo Jūn cast a *Tàixuān* talisman of life upon him, and he became a man, following Lǎo Jūn for over two hundred years. Lǎo Jūn had agreed to pay him one hundred *jīn* of gold per day, and when they reached Dà Qín and Ānxī, he would repay him in gold. Jiā, upon reaching the Pass, took pleasure in a woman and did not wish to follow Lǎo Jūn westward. He wrote a petition to Yìn Xǐ, accusing Lǎo Jūn and demanding his daily wages. Lǎo Jūn said to Jiā, *"You were once a withered corpse; I saved you with the *Tàixuān* talisman of life, making you a man. Now return the talisman, and I will repay your gold."* As he spoke, the talisman emerged from Jiā’s mouth, and he reverted to a withered corpse. Yìn Xǐ, seeing this, was terrified, kowtowed, and begged for mercy. Lǎo Jūn then cast the talisman upon him again, and Jiā resumed his former form. Yìn Xǐ, witnessing these divine transformations, became even more reverent.

5. **Returning Together to Lóuguān** – Yìn Xǐ, as Prefect of Hán Gǔ Pass, was stationed at the ruins of the ancient pass twelve *lǐ* south of Táolín County, Shǎnzhōu. In the first year of *Tiānbǎo* (742 CE), on the seventh day of the first month, *Rénwǔ*, Lǎo Jūn descended to the *Dānfèng Lóu* and revealed himself to the *Shǐmù* of Chén Wáng’s palace, Tián Tóngxiù. He produced the *Tiānbǎo Língfú*, stating that it was buried beneath the withered mulberry tree in the old residence of Yìn Xǐ at the ancient Hán Gǔ Pass. By imperial decree, Daoists and palace officials were sent to excavate beneath the tree, where a stone chest was found containing the *Tiānbǎo Língfú*, accompanied by purple clouds and a white rabbit. The emperor then granted a general amnesty and renamed Táolín County *Língbǎo County*.

At that very site, the **Língfú Guān** was established, and an imperial inscription was composed and inscribed on a stele, which remains to this day.

On the twenty-eighth day, Yìn Xǐ received the *Dàodé* and *Èrjīng*. Later, he returned with Lǎo Jūn from Hán Gǔ Pass to tidy his dwelling in the shadow of Zhǒngnán Mountain, where Yìn Xǐ had once resided. The dwelling was the very place where he had built a thatched pavilion to **observe the stars and divine the qi**.

After Yìn Xǐ ascended to heaven, it was traditionally called **Lóuguān**.

King Mù of Zhōu summoned the recluse Dù Chōng and Yìn Xǐ’s younger brother, Yìn Xuān, to dwell there. Within the precincts stood Lǎo Jūn’s **chariot board** and the **supporting-leather tree**. Across successive dynasties of Qin and Hán, emperors paid homage to the board, and even the brushstrokes of Qín Shǐhuáng’s ink remain preserved.

**Sixth [section]: Ascending into Tàiwéi**

When Lǎo Jūn expounded the scriptures to Yìn Xǐ and completed the transmission of the **Jiǔdān** and other precepts, on the twenty-sixth year of Zhāo Wáng, *Jiǎyín* month, fourth day, he ascended from Yìn Xǐ’s residence on South Mountain into Tàiwéi.

The *Xī Shēng Jīng* states:
*"After expounding the scriptures, Lǎo Jūn suddenly vanished. In a moment, the halls and lodgings blazed with radiant light—five colors mingling with dark and bright yellow. Yìn Xǐ stepped into the courtyard, knelt, and prayed: ‘O Divine Sage, grant me one more glimpse! Let me grasp a single essential principle to preserve the Primordial One.’*

*Suddenly, he beheld a golden figure—now alive, now fading, ever shifting between youth and age. Lǎo Jūn again addressed Yìn Xǐ: ‘Eliminate defilements, cease fixation, quiet the mind, and hold fast to the One. When all defilements are purged, all matters are complete. This is the essence of my Dao.’"*

Seventh, **the Meeting with the Green Sheep** was appointed. As Lǎo Jūn prepared to ascend into Tàiwéi, he told Yìn Xǐ: *"When the thousand-day practice is complete, seek me at the Green Sheep Market in Shù."* Yìn Xǐ then feigned illness and abandoned his position, eliminating defilements, ceasing fixation, quieting the mind, and holding fast to the One.

In the twenty-ninth year of Zhāo Wáng, on a *Dīngwèi* day, he entered Shù and met Lǎo Jūn at the Green Sheep Market. The Green Sheep Market lay five *lǐ* southwest of Chéngdū County, facing the great river. Ancient traditions recounted that it often displayed divine responses. In the second year of Zhōnghé, on a *Rén yín* day, when the Emperor Xī Zōng halted his procession in Shù, he obtained a sacred brick with ancient inscriptions. The auspicious signs moved the court, and the emperor personally visited the site, offering reverence and decreeing the establishment of the Green Sheep Palace. The brick bore the inscription: *"Supreme Sovereign Pacifies the Zhōnghé Calamity"* (六字: *Tàishàng píng zhōnghé zāi*).

Following the acquisition of the brick, the next year saw the recovery of Cháng'ān, and the year after, the emperor returned to the capital. **Eighth, both ascended to the Western Extreme.**

Three years after their separation, Yìn Xǐ’s thousand-day practice was complete. In the *Dīngwèi* year, he entered Shù and met Lǎo Jūn at the Green Sheep Market. Together, they rode upon clouds, traversed the celestial waters, ascended the Three Caverns, passed through the Nine Heavens, and finally transformed westward into the Flowing Sands, encompassing over eighty realms.

In the ninth month, twelfth day of the second year of Zhōnghé, due to the auspicious signs of the sacred brick, the emperor issued a decree: *"In ancient times, the Holy Ancestor, the Emperor Xiānyuán, expounded the True Scriptures with his disciple, the Master Wénshǐ, on the platform of Lóuguān. They agreed to reunite at the Green Sheep Market, riding upon clouds and transforming together into the Flowing Sands—a record passed down in immortal annals and marked upon terrestrial maps. From the time of Emperor Zhāo Wáng down to this day, spanning nearly two thousand years, their divine forms have faded into obscurity, and their traces have vanished. Now, with the imperial procession traversing the land, the radiant signs are manifest: pearly light leaping in the courtyard, sacred inscriptions revealed beneath the trees, the brick bearing ancient hues, and the characters verifying the auspicious omens. The Zhōnghé calamity is nearing its end, and the grand celestial blessings have now appeared. This demonstrates the descent of Heavenly favor and the Supreme Sovereign’s gracious portents, destined to annihilate the bandit’s arms and perpetually illuminate the cause of the Renewed Prosperity. It is fitting to inscribe these texts, proclaiming them to all regions and the military, and to bestow internal and external treasury funds upon this site. The Green Sheep Palace shall be established to honor these auspicious signs. Those entrusted with recording this in the Imperial Archives shall verify the transformations into the Flowing Sands, making them even more evident."*

**Annotations:**
*"Zhuó"* (着) here means **recorded or inscribed**—both the act of documenting and the resulting text.
It is also said that this was the time when the scriptures were composed, though they were originally expounded during the reign of Emperor Shùn and later granted to Yìn Xǐ. This is not a later composition but a reaffirmation of the teachings.

**Commentary:**
*"Thus, two treatises were expounded."* **Explication:** *"Thus"* marks the beginning of a new sentence. *"Expounded"* means to **elucidate and broaden the principles** of the Dao. The *"two treatises"* refer to the **Dàodé Jīng** and **Lǎozǐ’s other scriptures.**

The *Wáng Zǐ Nián Shíyí Jì* states:
*"Lǎo Jūn dwelled upon the Jǐngshì Mountains, cutting off all traces with the world. Only five ancient elders—some riding resonant cranes, others clad in feathered robes—discussed the numbers of Heaven and Earth. Their compiled scriptures amounted to ten thousand words. Two men from the Fútí realm offered pure ink, appearing now old, now young, vanishing into formlessness when unseen, concealing themselves when heard. At times, they emerged from a golden vessel containing a black fluid, resembling thick lacquer, which inscribed upon wood and stone the characters of the Eight Trigrams and Sixteen Hexagrams, recording the origins of creation and human kind. All the scriptures authored by Lǎo Jūn were inscribed upon jade tablets, bound with golden cords, and stored in jade cases. When the black fluid in the golden vessel was exhausted, the two men sought to carve their hearts and drip their blood as ink. This was the Jǐngshàn of Luózhōu, including the Lesser and Greater Caverns. The scriptures they spoke of—such as those on the Nine Transformations and Longevity—numbered a million, most hidden in sacred mountain chambers and kept secret. Now, the revealed texts amount to roughly six thousand volumes, all containing profound teachings for the realm and grand applications for nurturing life—not merely the two treatises on Dao and Virtue. These two scriptures are indeed the ones granted to Yìn Xǐ at the Hángǔ Valley."*

**Explication:**
*"Illuminating the source of Dao and the nurturing of Virtue, none escape its completeness."* **Meaning:** The Dao generates Virtue, which is the foundation of transformation. All laws arise from the Dao, hence it is called the **source**. It also likens the Dao to an endless spring, whose waters flow without depletion. *"Wǎng"* (罔) means **none** or **not**. The scriptures here record the origin and foundation of all transformations, exhaustively and without end.

**Explication:**
*"Its essence lies in harmonizing the body and rectifying the realm."* **Meaning:** The *Wénzǐ* in the *Tōngxiān Zhēnxīng Jīng* asked Lǎo Jūn: *"How does one rectify the realm?"* Lǎo Jūn replied: *"Rectification begins with harmonizing the self. One who has not first rectified the self cannot rectify the realm, nor can one whose self is disordered rectify the realm. The foundation of rectifying the realm lies in tranquility to cultivate the self and completeness to nurture life, thus preventing the people from disturbance. When the people are undisturbed, they do not grumble. The foundation of rectifying the realm lies in sufficient resources; the foundation of sufficient resources lies in not taking from others; the foundation of not taking lies in reducing affairs; the foundation of reducing affairs lies in moderation; the foundation of moderation lies in discernment of priorities—*"*

「The foundation of *going and staying* lies in *wuwei*—non-action. The heavens achieve their height, the earth their depth, the sun and moon shine, the stars follow their courses, and yin and yang harmonize—all without deliberate effort.

To align with the *Dao*, things naturally transform. This is the essence of *absolving pride and ostentation* and *discarding superficiality for simplicity*—the principle of *wuwei* and *non-speech* as teaching.

The opening passage of the *Lower Canon* states: *"A true gentleman dwells in substance, not in superficiality; in reality, not in ornamentation."* The second passage of the *Upper Canon* says: *"Thus, the Sage acts in non-action and governs through non-speech."* Teaching here means to *instruct and transform* people, so that guidance may endure eternally.

The *Analects* says: *"The Master employed four methods of teaching."* The *Preface to the Book of Songs* says: *"Teaching transforms through cultivation."* The *I Ching* says: *"The Sage establishes teaching through the mysterious *Dao*."* Speech-teaching means to *instruct* people.

Yet the multitude of teachings in the world all take *attachment and deliberate action* as their foundation. Now, the *Dao* of Lǎo Jūn is rooted in *wuwei* and *non-speech* as transformation—thus it is held in esteem by all teachings and prized by those who understand the *Dao*.

The *Comprehensive Explication of the Daoist Canon of Virtue and Way* concludes its third and fourth volumes.»

Du Guangcheng of the Tang Dynasty, annotated by Master Yu Liu, *Commentary on the Lower Section*:

**On cultivating the body:**
To cultivate the body, one must minimize private desires and reduce cravings, striving for an empty heart and a filled belly.
*Explanation:* Minimizing private desires and reducing cravings, achieving an empty heart and a filled belly—this is as the *Upper Scripture*, Chapter 19, states: *"Manifesting simplicity, embracing purity, minimizing private desires, reducing cravings."* The *Upper Scripture*, Chapter 3, states: *"Empty the heart, fill the belly."* The preceding scriptural references are all elucidated in the *Authentic Scripture*. Below, further distinctions shall be made.
*Matter* refers to the general term for all undertakings. The *Analects* states: *"The gentleman attends to the root"*—this is the same.

*Commentary:* Here lies the essential meaning, which can be articulated.
*Explanation:* *Essence* means the critical principle; *meaning* refers to the ultimate aim. This Scripture is the ultimate aim for cultivating the body and the critical principle for governing the state. It can be spoken of, and thus it can be articulated.

**On exhausting principles and fulfilling nature, severing attachments and stilling thoughts:**
*Explanation:* The *I Ching* states: *"Exhausting principles and fulfilling nature, until one reaches the utmost"*—meaning to penetrate the profound mysteries of all things, exhausting the inherent nature bestowed upon living beings. When the principles of things are exhausted and the true nature is fulfilled, one reaches unity. Another interpretation states: *"Exhausting principles"* means reaching the ultimate mysterious principles; *"fulfilling nature"* means investigating true nature. These mysterious principles and true natures are too profound and subtle to be articulated by words, though they can be discerned by the divine insight.

*Severing attachments and stilling thoughts* refers to desires arising from engaging with phenomena—this is called *attachment*; fixations arising from mental clinging—this is called *thought*. Within this doctrine, these are divided into four categories:
1. When the mind follows virtuous phenomena and generates virtuous desires, this is called *virtuous attachment*.
2. When the mind follows malevolent phenomena and generates malevolent desires, this is called *malevolent attachment*.
3. When the mind fixates on virtuous thoughts and generates virtuous contemplations, this is called *virtuous thought*.
4. When the mind fixates on malevolent thoughts and generates malevolent contemplations, this is called *malevolent thought*.

Though all arise from engaging with phenomena, they are divided into virtuous and malevolent. Beginners in the Dao must first sever malevolent attachments and still malevolent thoughts, thereby calming the mind. When the mind is serene and the *qi* is steady, thoughts and contemplations become genuine, gradually entering the Dao. Even virtuous attachments and thoughts are forgotten. When the profound principles are exhausted and true nature is fully realized, attachments and thoughts are both forgotten—only then can one attain the Dao. Hence it is said: *"Exhaust principles and fulfill nature, sever attachments and still thoughts."*

**On dwelling in reality and employing expedient means:**
*Explanation:* *Dwelling* means abiding. *Reality* refers to true truth and profound subtlety—the Dao of wondrous origin and the path of the Great Vehicle. *Expedient means* refers to adapting to circumstances, establishing teachings according to the times—this is the Middle Vehicle’s path to induce enlightenment, akin to the principles of governing the state and cultivating the body. First, one relies on expedient teachings, then enters the Great Dao.

*Teachings of reality* are as the *Upper Scripture*, Chapter 35, states: *"Hold fast to the Great Image, and all under heaven will come."* It also states: *"I shall govern it with the nameless Purity."* And again: *"From ancient times to the present, its name does not depart."* *Expedient teachings* are as the *Upper Scripture*, Chapter 36, states: *"When one seeks to contract it, one must first expand it; when one seeks to abolish it, one must first establish it."*

**On seated forgetting and abandoning illumination:**
*Explanation:* *Seated forgetting* means collapsing limbs, abandoning sensory perception, discarding form and wisdom, reaching Great Harmony. This is called *seated forgetting*. The ultimate Dao is too profound and subtle to be proclaimed in words; it can only be discerned by the mind. Once enlightenment is attained through illumination, even the illumination is forgotten. Hence it is said: *"Seated forgetting, abandoning illumination."* These are all teachings of the Great Vehicle.

**On diminishing again and again, making profound again and again, nearly beyond articulation or transmission:**
*Explanation:* Those who practice the Dao abandon the coarse to attain the subtle, diminishing again and again, gradually entering profound subtlety. Making profound again and again—this is ascending to true aspiration. The *Lower Scripture*, Chapter 48, states: *"Diminish again and again, until reaching non-action."* The *Upper Scripture*, Chapter 1, states: *"Making profound again and again, the gate of all mysteries."* This is attaining the profound and aligning with non-action—words cannot articulate it, nor can phrases describe it. Laozi said: *"If the Dao could be offered, I would offer it to my lord. If the Dao could be transmitted, I would transmit it to my son."* Indeed, it is not something that can be transmitted through words. *Diminishing* means annihilation; *profound* means deep subtlety.

**On its teachings being complete:**
*Explanation:* There are five teachings, divided into five categories:
1. *Dulling sharpness and resolving conflicts, blending light and harmonizing with dust*—this is the initial teaching.
2. *Manifesting simplicity and embracing purity, emptying the heart and filling the belly*—this is the gradual teaching.
3. *Externalizing the self while preserving it, yielding the self while advancing it*—this is the intermediate teaching.
4. *Diminishing again and again until reaching non-action, in non-action doing all things*—this is the complete teaching, where nothing is left unattended.
5. *Serene and ever-present, using it without exertion. Heaven and Earth have an end, but the Great Dao does not change*—this is the complete teaching.

Together, these form the teachings, encompassing all five categories, embracing all practices—hence it is said: *"Its teachings are complete."* *Complete* means universally permeating, the Dao being nowhere absent.

**On its text being concise:**
*Explanation:* *Concise* means limited and succinct. Within two scrolls, it encompasses all laws. Is this not concise?

**On its meaning being expansive:**
*Explanation:* *Expansive* means comprehensive. My words are easy to know, easy to practice—words have their origin, affairs have their master. Is this not expansive?

**On its speech being near:**
*Explanation:* *Near* means close. Observing oneself through oneself, observing the family through the family—without leaving the door, one knows the world; without peering through the window, one sees the Dao of Heaven. Is this not near?

**Thus, those who wander in its outer halls**
*Explanation:* *Halls* refers to the veranda; *regions* refers to the porch beneath the hall; *inner chambers* refers to the innermost sanctum, specifically the southwest corner.

「The scholars of the world and those who practice the Dao,
upon first seeing this scripture, claim to have fathomed the principles and exhausted the nature,
to have reached the utmost subtlety of the mysterious.

**Commentary:** But when they delve deeply and ponder thoroughly,
they realize that even at the tip of an autumn hare’s hair,
they have yet to grasp one ten-thousandth of its essence.

**Explanation:** Through profound inquiry and rigorous contemplation,
they examine the essence and ponder its workings,
explore the Dao’s deepest mysteries and trace its origins,
annotate and elucidate to seek the Sage’s intent—
the principles they uncover grow ever scarcer,
while the Sage’s meaning deepens beyond measure.

Guo Xiang says: The tip of an autumn hare’s hair is fine indeed,
yet they have not even attained one ten-thousandth of it.

The autumn hare’s hair refers to the fur a rabbit grows in autumn.
The *end* is its tip.

**Commentary:** The scripture states: *"There is a formless substance, born before Heaven and Earth."*

I do not know its name,
so I call it **Dao** and forcefully name it **Great**.
**Explanation:** Here, it cites the *Dao De Jing*’s twenty-fifth chapter
to validate the wondrous name of the Dao.

*"There is a formless substance"*—
a presence without a medium,
a vague and indistinct entity.
*"Mixed and unified"*—
before Heaven and Earth were divided,
it was called **Hun Dun** (Chaos).
Heaven was contained within Earth,
a boundless, formless void—
Heaven and Earth floated upon water,
accumulated within **Qi**,
thus it is called **Hun Yuan** (Primordial Chaos).
For it was from the Dao’s **Qi** that transformation and birth arose,
distributing forms and portents,
and thus Heaven and Earth came to be.
Yet the Dao’s **Qi** existed before Heaven and Earth,
while Heaven and Earth emerged after the Dao’s **Qi** was generated.
Hence, it says: *"There is a formless substance, born before Heaven and Earth."*

Zhuangzi says: *"The Great Dao—
before Heaven and Earth existed, it has eternally endured from antiquity."*

*"I"*—
the self-reference of Laozi.

The state of *"mixed and unified"*—
a hazy, indistinct form—
stands before Heaven and before Earth,
independent and boundless,
without a name proclaimed,
silent where words should be.
Thus Laozi forcefully establishes a character,
names it **Dao**,
and forcefully establishes a title,
calls it **Great**.
Its Dao is vast and boundless,
encompassing Heaven and Earth,
penetrating all things,
hence the name **Great Dao**.

**Commentary:** Thus, one knows that the **Great Dao** is a forceful name
for the **supreme void** and **mysterious origin**,
speaking to its universal generative power.

**Explanation:** The Dao has **emotion** and **truth**,
yet is **non-action** and **formless**.
It can be transmitted but not bestowed,
obtained but not seen—
existing beyond the **Great Polarity** yet not elevated,
beneath the **Six Extremes** yet not deep.
Hence, it is called the **supreme void’s mysterious origin**.

Because it gives birth to Heaven and Earth,
to spirits and divine emperors,
it is said to be the universal generative power.
The Dao is **universal**.
The **void** is **utter emptiness**.
The **extreme** is **utter height**.
The **mysterious** is **utter profundity**.
The **origin** is the **source of transformation**.

**Commentary:** Zhuangzi says:
*"At the beginning of all, there is the Void and the Non-Void.
The Non-Void without name—
this is before any forceful naming."*

Thus the scripture says:
*"The unnamed is the beginning of Heaven and Earth."*

**Explanation:** Zhuangzi, of the surname Zhuang and given name Zhou,
was from Mengyi in the state of Song.
During the reigns of King Wen of Zhao, King Xuan of Qi, and King Hui of Liang,
he studied under Master Sang Gongzi,
received his subtle teachings,
and retired to Baoxie Mountain,
where he ingested the **Great Elixir** and ascended to Heaven,
holding the title **Weibian Officer of the Great Polarity**,
serving the Celestial Sovereign in the morning court.

Jì Kāng says:
*"He also studied under Master Qián Zǐ,
and during his lifetime served as a **lacquer-garden official**,
composing thirty-three works,
all expounding the Dao’s boundless, effortless principles."*

In the fourth year of Tianbao in the **Great Tang Dynasty** (April),
he was posthumously enshrined as **Zhenren of Nan Hua**,
and his works were titled *The Nan Hua Zhen Jing*.
This passage cites the twelfth chapter, *"The Heaven and Earth."*

The **"beginning of all"**—
this is before **Qi** manifested.
The **"Void and Non-Void"**—
the Non-Void lacks name because it is without form.
This refers to the Dao before any forceful naming was established—
the Great Dao was unnamed,
and only when named was it called **Dao**.
The initial forceful naming marks the beginning of Heaven and Earth.

**Commentary:** The Dao is forcefully named as the **universal generative principle**,
thus the scripture says:
*"The named is the mother of all things."*

**Explanation:** The Dao is **universal**.
It generates and transforms all things through **one Qi**,
and because it gives birth to things,
it is called the **mother of all things**.
The term *mother* signifies **nurturing abundance**.
The scripture’s words point to its opening chapter,
citing this passage to validate the Dao’s name.

**Commentary:** Zhuangzi also says:
*"When things obtain the Dao, they are called virtue."*

**Explanation:** This is from the *"Heaven and Earth"* chapter of *Zhuangzi*.
The **void** alone cannot generate things,
but when things obtain the Dao’s subtle and mysterious **Qi**,
they can self-generate—
this is **self-attainment**.
Left to their own self-attainment,
it is called **virtue**.

**Commentary:** Virtue is **attainment**.
Heaven and Earth undergo ten thousand changes,
permeating all categories of things,
all relying on the mysterious origin to manifest and thrive—
attaining generation is virtue.

**Explanation:** Virtue is what humans attain.
The Three Realms and all things draw upon the Dao’s wondrous applications,
each attaining their own generation and fulfillment,
none failing to align with their nature—
hence it is called **virtue**.

*"Permeating all"*—
meaning **all-encompassing**.
*"Categories of things"*—
all things.
*"Relying"*—
taking, utilizing.
*"Mysterious origin"*—
the Dao.

**Commentary:** Thus the scripture says:
*"The Dao gives birth to them; virtue nourishes them."*

**Explanation:** This is from the fourteenth chapter below.
It cites the main text to reiterate the meaning of **Dao** and **virtue**,
aligning with Zhuangzi’s principle that *"things obtain the Dao to generate."*
This clarifies that the **void** is the root,
while the **non-void** is its function.
**Dao** and **virtue** are interdependent,
serving as the themes for the upper and lower chapters.

**Commentary:** Thus, one knows that **Dao** is the **substance of virtue**,
and **virtue** is the **function of Dao**.

**Explanation:** The **true and solid** is called **substance**,
while **adaptive response** is called **function**—
the **Dao’s profound and boundless** transformations
generate and fulfill all things,
leaving no trace,
hence it is called **substance**—
the **wondrous substance**.
Zhuangzi says:
*"Its coming is without trace,
its departure is without limit—
no gate, no side,
the sovereign of fourfold reach, majestic and boundless."*

「Through this wondrous substance, life and death unfold in endless cycles,
and all living things transform naturally—
their existence visible yet not controlled,
hence it is called **function**.
This is the **wondrous function**.
Zhuangzi says:
*"The luminous arises from the obscure,
the manifest from the formless*—
this is the case.

**Commentary:** And thus the scripture divides into upper and lower chapters.
**Explanation:** The obscure Dao is the upper.
The luminous virtue is the lower.
The Great Sage expounds the scripture,
originally making no distinction between Dao above and virtue below.
Yet those who interpret it forcibly divide it,
claiming that **Dao** without **virtue** lacks manifestation,
and **virtue** without **Dao** lacks clarity—
**Dao** being formless and without action,
thus precedes the transformation of things;
**virtue** being active and purposeful,
thus follows after life and transformation.
Since **Dao** precedes, it is placed above;
since **virtue** follows, it is placed below.
Thus, the upper and lower chapters are divided,
just as the clear heaven resides above,
and the turbid earth below.

**Commentary:** First, **Dao** is clarified, then **virtue** follows.
**Explanation:** The wondrous void generates the wondrous non-void,
from the subtle to the coarse.
The "following" refers to what is secondary—
the order of precedence.
**Commentary:** Yet the names of substance and function may be dispersed.
**Explanation:** The subtle and coarse, the precedence and sequence,
may be spoken of in pairs.
Substance is subtle as the root—
the uncarved block;
function is coarse as the end—
the vessel.
Hence it is said to be dispersed.
**Commentary:** But the reality of substance and function cannot be dispersed.
**Explanation:** They are in harmony with the void,
hence cannot be dispersed.
Dispersed refers to division and distinction.
Though distinctions arise through function,
in the beginning and end of life and transformation,
where they rely on and complement each other,
returning to the source of their true nature,
they cannot be truly dispersed.
All forms differ yet contain the wondrous Dao.
**Commentary:** Therefore, the scripture states:
*"Same origin, different names—
same called the Mysterious."*
**Explanation:** The wondrous substance and function arise from the wondrous void—
this is their same origin.
From subtle to coarse—
this is their differing names.
Merged as one—
this is why they are called the Mysterious.
**Commentary:** When spoken of as arising, they are divided into two;
when observed in their essence, they merge as one.
**Explanation:** Divided into two refers to substance and function.
Merged as one refers to returning to the wondrous source.
Zhuangzi says:
*"Majestic and vast—
its end is but the beginning again."*
**Commentary:** Hence it is said that they may be dispersed yet cannot be.
**Explanation:** Though substance and function differ,
how can they be truly dispersed?
They illuminate each other—
thus they cannot be dispersed.

**Commentary:** The upper chapter states:
*"This is called the Mysterious Virtue,"*
*"The vast container of Virtue,"*
*"Virtue is aligned with Virtue,"*
*"Constant Virtue does not depart."*
**Explanation:** In the *Dao* scripture,
these passages clarify that **virtue** illuminates **Dao**.

**Commentary:** The lower chapter states:
*"Lost the Dao, then Virtue appears,"*
*"Reversion is the movement of the Dao,"*
*"The Dao generates One,"*
*"The Great Dao is most easy."*
**Explanation:** In the *Virtue* scripture,
these passages clarify that **Dao** is the foundation of **virtue**.

**Commentary:** This is their mutual exposition,
each revealing the essence in turn.
**Explanation:** **Dao** illuminates **virtue**, **virtue** aligns with **Dao**—
this is their mutual exposition.
Mutual means reciprocal, differing yet complementary.
Exposition means to unfold.
Examining their principles together,
all reach the utmost subtlety—
this is what is meant by "cannot be dispersed."

**Commentary:** They need not be rigidly named as upper or lower.
**Explanation:** Though externally **Dao** and **virtue** differ,
the scripture’s mutual exposition means
one cannot designate the *Dao* scripture as upper
and the *Virtue* scripture as lower.
Those who now distinguish them
do so by force, not by the true essence of the Mysterious.

**Commentary:** The scripture is a path.
**Explanation:** It is the way to practice the Dao,
the gate to ascend to the True.
Left Ru says:
*"The scripture is the unalterable book."*
The essence of the Dao is conveyed through this path.
**Commentary:** It is also the constant way.
**Explanation:** Through the scripture, the Dao is conveyed,
and thus the Dao is forever illuminated.
Hence it is called the constant way.
From the mundane to the immortal,
from the extreme of immortality to eternal fruit,
the teachings descend in writing through endless ages,
universally saving all without end—
eternal peace, long life—
all stem from this teaching.
Thus it is said to be the constant path of practice.

**Commentary:** The Sage’s ancestors imparted their teachings,
passing them to their descendants.
**Explanation:** *Every* means repeatedly, *incumbency* means reverence.
The Sage’s ancestors—Laozi the Old Master—
imparted their teachings,
bestowing them upon their descendants.
As in the *Book of Songs* ["King Wen’s Odes" – *"King Wen’s Odes"* is a placeholder for the exact title, likely **《文王有声》**]:
*"Passing their plans to their descendants,
to shelter and nurture them with their wings."*
This means that King Wu could expand King Wen’s teachings,
enhance his achievements,
and transmit the realm to his descendants.
It speaks of the Mysterious Origin,
the Sage’s ancestors imparting the teachings of
effortless stillness and clarity,
reaching our Tang descendants,
and with this imperial plan,
propagating and magnifying the Dao’s transformation.

**Commentary:** In moments of rest from governing,
the Emperor diligently studies and expounds.
**Explanation:** The Son of Heaven sits enthroned facing south,
listening to the affairs of the realm.
Governance is also *principle*.
In the leisure of listening to affairs,
he studies the two scriptures,
just as Yi did in the night.
The term *file* refers to reading,
*commentary* to expounding.
Having read the text,
he expounds its meaning,
thus creating annotations and commentaries.
Diligently studying means
unceasingly searching and elucidating.
The *remainder* is the time of leisure.

**Commentary:** Now, I again briefly expound the annotations.
**Explanation:** *Expound* means to evaluate.
To elucidate the true meaning,
to examine the Mysterious subtleties,
and to unfold these two teachings—
this captures the essence of
governing the realm and cultivating the self,
effortless stillness and clarity.

**Commentary:** The most essential and wondrous points
cannot be fully conveyed by writing.
**Explanation:** *Essential* means the utmost subtlety,
*wondrous* means the Mysterious profundity.
The utmost subtlety and Mysterious profundity
cannot be transmitted through books.
The principles transcend words and arguments,
hence it is said that books cannot exhaust the meaning.

The *Yijing* says: "Books cannot exhaust words, words cannot exhaust meaning."
Indeed, the unspoken words are the ultimate words,
and the principles that reach their full extent are the ultimate principles.
Only then can one penetrate the Mysterious and fathom the profound,
achieve enlightenment and forget words—
this is why such teachings cannot be fully conveyed by mere texts.

**Commentary:** Here I merely outline the broad strokes,
to aid and assist those who study.

**Explanation:** *Merely* means not thorough, *outline* means to summarize briefly.
*Aid* means to benefit, *assist* means to support.
*Broad strokes* refers to the main threads—
like the cords that bind a net, from which all its strands hang,
or the collar that holds a garment together.
The *Huainanzi* says: "Raise the main threads, and all the strands unfurl."
This is the term for summarizing the multitude of threads.
By raising the main threads, all the strands become visible.
This commentary is meant to support and benefit those who lecture and study,
expanding their knowledge and insight.

I humbly reflect that the Heavenly Scriptures shine resplendent,
displaying the sun and moon to harmonize their brilliance,
while the Saintly Teachings are profound and subtle,
coexisting with Heaven and Earth in eternal motion.
They enter deeply into the realm of Nature,
and open vast the doors to all wonders.
They elevate the peaks of words to tower above the masses,
and plumb the depths of meaning to reach the ocean’s vastness.
Those lost in error dissolve their doubts at a mere glance,
and those straying return to the path upon hearing the teachings.
The True Ancestor expounded the utmost subtlety in the beginning,
and the Wise Descendant praised the Mysterious profundity thereafter.
The two Saints composed their works,
unmatched through all ages,
yet still they speak of aiding and assisting,
demonstrating their humility and modesty,
further illuminating their Saintly Intent.

**Commentary:** In total, there are six volumes.

**Explanation:** *In total* refers to the general outline, a sweeping overview.
The *Chunqiu xu* says: "To generalize is to state the rules."
The two main sections (upper and lower) each have three volumes of commentary,
also roughly illustrating the meaning of "one life, three stages."
Six is the number of Yin, while three is the number of Yang.
Three symbolizes *Qian*—when *Qian* combines with *Qian*, it becomes *Kun*.
Separated, it is Yang; combined, it is Yin.
This commentary encompasses the essentials of Heaven and Earth,
and exhausts the subtleties of Yin and Yang’s transformations—
thus it forms six volumes.

Moreover, *in total* is also the name for the birth of the upper and the rise of the lower.

The *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power True Scripture* – *Expounding Saintly Teachings* (Volume IV completed)
The *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power True Scripture* – *Expounding Saintly Teachings* (Volume V completed)

The *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power True Scripture* – *Expounding Saintly Teachings* (as expounded by Master Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting)
*Explication of the Title: The Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Scripture*

**Explication of the Meaning:**
The *Laozi* is the inner title of the *Taishang Laojun*. The interpretation has already been fully explained in the preceding section.

The *Dao/Way Scripture* refers to these two scrolls of the text, with the Upper Scroll taking *Dao/Way* as its heading. The *Dao/Way* permeates and guides all living beings, penetrates and transcends all *dharma/law*, and stands at the forefront of all *dharma/law*—thus the Three Sovereigns revered its *Dao/Way*. It precedes all teachings, hence the Great Performance (of the Dao) manifests its boundless essence. Therefore, "one" is the count of *Dao/Way*, and *Dao/Way* is the origin of "one." The Lower Scroll states, *"The Dao/Way gives birth to One"*—this is the same meaning.

As for its *Dao/Way*, it exhausts the wondrous subtleties of boundless emptiness and fulfills the divine function of transformation and salvation. Its principles permeate the process of generation, and its meaning encompasses cause and effect. When applied to oneself, it leads to the simultaneous transcendence of self and object; when embraced in the heart, it achieves the dual absolution of existence and non-existence.

The *Dao/Way* and *Virtue/Power* share a reciprocal and interdependent meaning—thus it is called the *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Scripture*. Here, within the *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Scripture*, we elucidate three categories:

1. **Explicating the Nameless Name**—to clarify the profound teachings of the Dao/Way. Hence the Scripture says, *"The constant emptiness naturally endures;"* yet, to name the Great Dao/Way, we must assign a label. Thus, the Dao/Way’s essence is in the "Nameless," while its practical application may appear flawed; *Virtue/Power*’s essence is in the "Having," yet it resolves all worldly doubts. Hence, the *Zang Xuanjing* says: *"The Dao/Way’s meaning lies in its ability to penetrate all things through emptiness."* Now, to clarify the Dao/Way’s threefold meaning:

   - **Principle** (*li*), for discerning the reality of emptiness and distinguishing good and evil.
   - **Guidance** (*dao*), for leading adherents to forget their attachments and guiding the common into the saintly.
   - **Penetration** (*tong*), for generating all *dharma/law* and achieving transformation without obstruction.

The Upper Scroll embodies Yang’s celestial symbolism, hence its thirty-seven chapters. The *Laojun* did not originally distinguish the Upper Scroll as *Dao/Way* and the Lower as *Virtue/Power*—rather, the tradition of past sages divided them as such. Thus, *Dao/Way* precedes *Virtue/Power*, though their texts mutually illuminate and verify one another, as detailed in the preface.

Next, the decline of *Dao/Way* gave rise to *Virtue/Power*, and the decline of *Virtue/Power* led to the Five Constants (*wuxing*). This demonstrates that *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power* are the foundation of all practices, the root of the Five Constants. Hence, the *Dao/Way Scripture* comes first, followed by the *Virtue/Power Scripture*.

Now, in accordance with the title, we elucidate *Dao/Way* as the **Principle**, **Penetration**, and **Guidance**—as stated in the preface. The threefold explication of *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power* consists of:

1. **Explicating the Name**—the Dao/Way is profound and absolute, naturally deserving the "Nameless." Yet, to initiate teachings and guide the common, we must establish a designation. Thus, we borrow the "Nameless" as a label to convey its true principle, so that one may recognize the "Nameless" within the name and truly grasp the Dao/Way’s profound designation as *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power*. What is its meaning? The *Zang Xuanjing* says: *"The Dao/Way’s function is to penetrate all things through emptiness."* *Virtue/Power* means not losing—its function is in the "Having." The Dao/Way’s emptiness can dispel the burdens of material existence; *Virtue/Power*’s having can remove all worldly doubts.

Now, we clarify the Dao/Way’s threefold meaning: **Principle**, **Penetration**, and **Guidance**. *Virtue/Power*’s threefold meaning is: **Attainment**, **Fulfillment**, and **Non-Loss**.

The meaning of **Principle** is to discern the reality of emptiness—speaking of all things as empty, hence it says, *"The Dao/Way dwells within all that has."* The explanation is that **Principle** encompasses both good and evil. Good is also called the Dao/Way, evil is also called the Dao/Way, yet the nature of good and evil is empty—this does not contradict the meaning. However, calling evil the Dao/Way is not correct; it is merely a conventional designation, not a true elucidation of the principle. If one says that evil is close to the principle in its circumstances, this interpretation is acceptable.

The meaning of **Penetration** is the ability to generate all things and achieve transformation without obstruction. The *Heshang Gong* says: *"The Dao/Way is fourfold penetration."*

The meaning of **Guidance** is to lead adherents to forget their attachments and guide the common into the saintly. The *Scripture of Natural Endurance* says: *"Guide the end to return to the root; the root is true nature, the end is delusive emotions."*

*Virtue/Power* has threefold meaning:

The meaning of **Attainment** is that *Virtue/Power* is the fruit obtained from the Dao/Way. The *Taiping Scripture* says: *"Virtue/Power is the name for the proper attainment."*

The meaning of **Fulfillment** is to fulfill and save all beings, leading them to attain the Dao/Way’s ultimate perfection. This is the name given to the fruit, also relying on the fulfillment of emptiness in the cause—hence the Scripture says, *"It matures and fulfills."*

The meaning of **Non-Loss** is that *Virtue/Power* does not lose—hence it says, *"Non-loss."* The *Taiping Scripture* says: *"Constant Virtue/Power does not lose"*—this is the same meaning.

These six meanings can be mutually interrelated. The *Scripture of Western Ascension* says: *"Dao/Way and Virtue/Power are mixed and boundless, their profound mystery is the same."* Within the Dao/Way, there is the meaning of *Virtue/Power*—the *Scripture of Ascending the Mysterious* says: *"Virtue/Power is equal to the Dao/Way’s equality; equality is the Dao/Way’s equality"*—hence it says, *"The Dao/Way has the meaning of attainment."* The Dao/Way has the meaning of **Fulfillment**—the *Heshang Gong* says: *"Not only does it give birth, but it also nurtures and fulfills."* The Dao/Way has the meaning of **Non-Loss**—since it speaks of the "constant Dao/Way," constant implies non-loss.

Within *Virtue/Power*, there is also the meaning of **Principle**—the *Scripture of Life’s Divine Mystery* says: *"Response and correspondence are the constant principle of Virtue/Power; response is Virtue/Power itself"*—hence it says, *"Virtue/Power has the meaning of principle."*

*Virtue/Power* has the meaning of **Penetration**—the *Heshang Gong* says: *"Virtue/Power is one;"* when one reaches the stage of distributing *qi* and nurturing all things, it is called **Penetration**."

*Virtue/Power* has the meaning of **Guidance**—this refers to the *Virtue/Power* of opening and guiding, as the *Analects* says: *"Guide them with Virtue/Power"*—this is the same.

Within the **Penetration** category, it is as previously explained. But the Dao/Way’s **Penetration** means it permeates all without obstruction, yet nothing is excluded from its reach. *Virtue/Power*’s **Attainment** means it attains all without limitation, yet nothing is excluded from its grasp. Hence, it can forget self and function, yet generate and fulfill all things.

Now, within this category, we further divide into five distinctions:

1. **Explication by Name**—as previously explained.
2. **Explication by Cause and Effect**—to clarify that without *Virtue/Power*, there is no way to speak of *Dao/Way*; without *Dao/Way*, there is no way to speak of *Virtue/Power*. *Dao/Way* and *Virtue/Power* are interdependent; hence we establish provisional names. Thus, without *Dao/Way*, there is no *Virtue/Power*; without *Virtue/Power*, there is no *Dao/Way*. *Dao/Way* is the essence of *Virtue/Power*; *Virtue/Power* is the essence of *Dao/Way*. The Scripture says: *"Long and short define each other"*—this is the same.
3. **Explication by Manifestation**—*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power* serve as teachings, properly illustrating the principle of neither *Dao/Way* nor *Virtue/Power*. Hence, when speaking of *Dao/Way*, it says, *"What can be spoken of is not the constant Dao/Way"*—and when clarifying *Virtue/Power*, it says, *"The highest Virtue/Power is not Virtue/Power."* Thus, neither *Dao/Way* nor *Virtue/Power* is the true meaning of *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power*.

**4. The Release of Boundlessness**—
The single *Virtue/Power* encompasses boundless meanings. Just as effects arise from causes, so too do its meanings unfold. The *Dao/Way* pervades all things; how then could it be confined to a single designation? Thus, it is called "boundless" to elucidate its essence.

**5. The Release of Non-Release**—
Since it is not named, it is also called "meaningless" as its meaning. Thus, the natural essence is termed *non-possession*. Tracing its origin, it is the very meaning of *non-meaning*. It is said:
*The Dao/Way* is named by its generative function;
*Virtue/Power* is named by its teachings.
The Dao/Way is the universal principle of *Virtue/Power*;
*Virtue/Power* is the manifestation of the Dao/Way.
When *Virtue/Power* is present, it is called the Dao/Way;
When the Dao/Way is present, it is called *Virtue/Power*.
The meaning of *Virtue/Power* is taken from its substantial yet non-doing nature;
The meaning of the Dao/Way is taken from its non-substantial yet doing nature.

*The Scripture of Master Lu* states:
*"The Dao/Way’s essence is emptiness and stillness—
void of substance, uncommunicating;
silent, unresponsive."*

*Zang Xuanjing* says:
*"Wisdom is the Dao/Way’s essence;
Divine penetration is its function."*

It is further said:
*The Dao/Way and Virtue/Power* are one in essence yet two in meaning—
one yet not one, two yet not two.
Two yet not two, because of the one;
One yet not one, because of the two.
It cannot be said to have substance or lack it,
to have function or lack it.
For the substance is non-substance—
substance without substance;
The function is non-function—
function without function.

Thus, no single *Virtue/Power* is not its substance,
No single function is not its manifestation.
Seeking its substance, it transcends emptiness and being,
neither yin nor yang—
unseen by sight, untouched by sense.
Seeking its function, it adapts to circumstances,
can be left or right, small or great,
containing the great within the small, the small within the great.
Its substance is without end, hence unthinkable and unutterable.
Its function is without effort, hence revealed only in its place.

Now this is not different—
only that the Dao/Way and *Virtue/Power* differ yet do not differ,
are the same yet differ.
Through discourse, distinctions arise—
different yet the same in body,
one in essence when examined.

That which is not different yet differs—
the Scripture says: *"The Dao/Way generates it; Virtue/Power nourishes it."*
That which is different yet the same—
*The Scripture of Western Ascension* says: *"The Dao/Way and Virtue/Power are mixed and mysterious, identical in essence."*

Knowing that which is not different yet differs—
there is nothing to differentiate.
Knowing that which is different yet the same—
there is nothing to unify.
There is nothing to unify, hence nothing to differentiate;
There is nothing to differentiate, hence nothing but differentiation.

Now, seven meanings are further expounded to elucidate them:

**1. Origin and Trace**—
The origin is the Dao/Way; the trace is *Virtue/Power*.
The origin as Dao/Way—
its essence is the eternal, true, and still source of great wisdom.
The trace as *Virtue/Power*—
its essence is the sovereign *Virtue/Power* of the Supreme One’s responsive body.

**2. Principle and Teaching**—
The principle is the Dao/Way; the teaching is *Virtue/Power*.
The principle as Dao/Way—
its essence is the awakening to true nature.
The teaching as *Virtue/Power*—
its essence is the awakening to true scripture.

**3. Realm and Wisdom**—
The realm is the Dao/Way; wisdom is *Virtue/Power*.
Wisdom as Dao/Way’s essence;
Principle-wisdom as *Virtue/Power*’s essence.

**4. Person and Law**—
The person is the Dao/Way; the law is *Virtue/Power*.
The person as Dao/Way—
its essence is the dual bodies of origin and trace.
The law as *Virtue/Power*—
its essence is the dual teachings of principle and doctrine.

**5. Generation and Completion**—
Generation is the Dao/Way; completion is *Virtue/Power*.
The Dao/Way generates all things through responding to *qi*—
its essence is the responsive *qi* itself.
Completion as *Virtue/Power*—
its essence is the fulfillment of beings through teachings and laws.

**6. Being and Non-Being**—
Non-being is the Dao/Way; being is *Virtue/Power*.
Non-being as Dao/Way—
its essence is the empty observation of the fruit-ground yielding empty wisdom.
Being as *Virtue/Power*—
its essence is the observant wisdom of the fruit-ground arising from the seed-ground’s being.

**7. Cause and Fruit**—
The fruit is the Dao/Way; the cause is *Virtue/Power*.
The fruit as Dao/Way—
its essence is the ten thousand *Virtues/Powers* of the fruit-ground.
The cause as *Virtue/Power*—
its essence is the ten thousand actions of the seed-ground.

These seven meanings interweave mutually—
two yet not two, one yet not one.
Thus, the Dao/Way and *Virtue/Power* are the true essence,
neither fruit nor cause, neither origin nor trace.
Neither origin nor trace, yet opening origin and trace—
to clearly reveal the origin through the trace.
Neither fruit nor cause, yet opening cause and fruit—
to guide cultivation from cause to fruition.

The remaining five pairs need not be spoken of;
their meanings are evident in the third.
*Virtue/Power* is the "having" of non-possession—
capable of ordering the non-existent, also ordering the existent.
The Dao/Way is the "non-non-being"—
capable of ordering the existent, also ordering the non-existent.

The deluded say: *"The Dao/Way is like jade’s form and gold’s appearance—
a real, substantial existence."*
Now it is clarified that the Dao/Way is emptiness—
this is the delusion of ordering the existent.
*Riverbank Master* says: *"The Dao/Way is emptiness."*
*Wang Fusi* says: *"The Dao/Way is the naming of non-being."*

The deluded also say: *"The constant Dao/Way is the supreme Virtue/Power—
truly emptiness and non-being."*
Now it is clarified that this is *Virtue/Power* in possession—
thus removing the delusion, as the Scripture says:
*"In the dim and obscure, there is essence—
this is the mutual reversal of names, dispelling delusion through hearing."*

As understanding deepens, the meaning grows clearer:
The Dao/Way’s non-being is also not this non-being;
*Virtue/Power*’s being is also not this being.
Thus, there is no non-being of non-being—
the delusion is entirely exhausted,
only then does one align with the *Heavy Mysterious*—
the dual transcendence.

Hence the Scripture says: *"The Dao/Way of the Immortal is neither non-being nor being."*

Thus, the Dao/Way must rely on *Virtue/Power*,
*Virtue/Power* must draw from the Dao/Way.
Laozi’s teachings do not rigidly divide
the upper scroll as Dao/Way, the lower as *Virtue/Power*.
The two scriptures’ meanings mutually contain each other;
later sages, in transmission, forcibly partitioned their meanings—
thus, *The Dao/Way Scripture* contains *Virtue/Power*,
*The Virtue/Power Scripture* contains the Dao/Way,
as the sacred intent already clearly states within its sequence.

As for the over five thousand words,
they are not fixed in number.
Balancing form and substance, harmonizing meaning and principle—
one must not constrain the text by letter count,
nor prune its flow to fit a number,
lest the grand intent be lost.

The Sima Qian says that the text of over five thousand words is not fixed to five thousand characters. Those who truncate the wording and reduce the count, forcing the text to four thousand nine hundred ninety-nine words by splitting the thirty *rú* characters into thirty to reach five thousand characters—this is like binding oneself to a pillar and carving boats into stone, clinging to error and failing to grasp the truth.

The interpretations of the *Scripture* by various scholars encompass four meanings in total:
1. **By cause**—the Three Worlds Celestial Sovereigns and the Ten Directions Great Saints derive from the *Scripture*, attain enlightenment, and realize the True.
2. **By path**—they open and reveal the Dao/Way’s principles, guide all beings, and serve as the bridge for scholars to traverse the path to the True.
3. **By law**—they embody the True essence and profound mysteries, the utmost principles and subtle truths, which can regulate and model all beings, setting the standard for countless sages.
4. **By eternal constancy**—they hold the profound and distant principles, the silent and mysterious Dao/Way, as unalterable norms for all ages and rulers.

Together, these four meanings constitute the *Scripture*. Some say it was formed by condensing *qi*, written in cloud-like seals, with characters a yard in size and eight angles descending like rays. Others claim it was inscribed in purple characters on jade tablets, as the *Dragon Scriptures* and *Phoenix Writings*, descending at the beginning of a *kalpa* and returning to Heaven at its end. Still others say it was engraved on jade, chiseled in gold, or written on bamboo, wood, silk, or paper, transmitted through the ages in evolving scripts—whether rough or refined, all are the True Secrets of the Mysterious Sage, the perfect remedy for spiritual ailments, and the wondrous gate to transcendence.

Even if the ages change and the *kalpa* shifts, if gold melts and stone dissolves, yet this *Scripture* endures its teachings, perpetually spread among humans and deities, lasting through countless *kalpas*—thus, it is called the *Scripture*.

Hence, the title is given as *Commentary on the Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Scripture of Laozi*, the uppermost scroll of the first volume.

As for these two chapters, they are profound and mysterious, with five thousand words of subtle depths, encompassing all laws and crowning all scriptures. Yet the accounts of their era, the timing of crossing the pass, their birth order, and the core intent of their teachings remain unclear among the various interpretations. Now, I elucidate the four gates to dispel confusion.

**First**, clarifying the matter of descent and birth. Laozi is the origin of the Ultimate Dao/Way, the root of Primordial Transformation. He existed in the distant antiquity yet was not its first, and was born in the final age yet was not its last. How much more so, given that he already propagated the Dao/Way before countless *kalpas*—how could one claim his birth depended on the womb and call that *birth*?

Now, when speaking of descent and birth, it is but a manifestation in the mortal realm, showing the appearance of a beginning. He took form from the Holy Mother, demonstrating birth. The Mother was devoted to the Primordial Lord, showing reverence. Today, according to the *Scripture*’s records, after the oaths of allegiance and the ritual of *liè* (sacrificial branding), there are three instances of descent and birth:

1. In the year *Gēngyín* (Regina) of the seventh year of *Shànghé* (Upper Harmony), on the third day of the ninth month, the *jiǎzǐ* (day-stem-branch) combination of *Jiazi* (甲子), he was born between the Li Valley and the Northern Mysterious Woman’s realm in the Heavenly Gorge, on the Lingjing Mountain. His Holy Mother was named the Mother of *Xuányú* (玄虚). When he was born, for three days the sun shone from the east, and nine dragons spat water to bathe his form. He took the surname Li from the Li Valley, given name *Xuānyuán* (玄元), and title *Zǐguāng* (子光). He was the supreme crown of the Highest Sage, the descendant of the Jade Emperor, and held the rank of *Lǎngshēng Dàzhǔ Tàipíng Zhèngzhēn Tàiyī Jūn Jīnquè Hòushèng Jiǔ Xuán Dìjūn* (长生大主太平正真太一君金阙后圣九玄帝君). Upon careful examination, this was before the beginning of the *kalpa*, with *Zhūlíng Shànghé* (朱灵上和) as the year title of the prior *kalpa*.

2. In the year *Gēngchén* (Regina) of *Yīn Wǔdīng* (殷武丁), on the fifteenth day of the second month, at the *chǒu* hour (卯), he was born in the *Léxiāng* (濑乡) of *Kǔ Xiàn* (苦县) in the state of Chen. His Holy Mother was named the *Xuānmiaò Yùnǚ* (玄妙玉女). He was the teacher of the Supreme Lord, later ascending to the rank of *Yuánjūn* (元君). Upon careful examination, this aligns with the year and month of his descent in *Bózhōu* (亳州). According to the *Chánglì* (长历) by *Huángfǔ Shì’ān* (皇甫士安), the *jiǎzǐ* (甲子) cycle confirms that the *Tàisù* (太岁) of *Dīngmǎo* (丁卯) was the teacher of the Zhou. This corresponds to the *Zhòu* (纣) year of *Dīngwèi* (丁未), the twenty-first year of *Dīngmǎo* (丁卯), when Laozi dwelled at Qíshān (岐山) and served as the teacher of the Western Earl of Zhou. From the ninth year of *Wǔdīng* (武丁) in the *Gēngchén* (庚辰) cycle to the *Zhòu* (纣) year of *Dīngmǎo* (丁卯), spanning one hundred eighty years. Then, in the twenty-fifth year of *Zhāowáng* (昭王) in the *Guǐchǒu* (癸丑) cycle, he crossed the pass and departed westward, totaling one hundred seventy years. Altogether, this sums to two hundred fifteen years. Sima Qian’s account of over two hundred years is correct.

Those misled claim Laozi descended during the reigns of *Píngwáng* (平王), *Dìngwáng* (定王), *Yōuwáng* (幽王), or *Lìwáng* (厉王). These are all false assertions, utterly erroneous. Why? If he had descended during the reigns of *Yōu* (幽) and *Lì* (厉), or *Píng* (平) and *Dìng* (定), he would not have been able to meet with *Wénwáng* (文王) and *Wǔwáng* (武王).

**Third**, when Laozi departed from the *Lóuguān* (楼观) and took leave of *Yǐn Xǐ* (尹喜), it was in the *Jiǎyín* (甲寅) year of the twenty-sixth year of *Zhāowáng* (昭王). They met at the *Qīngyáng* (青羊) market in Shu, and thus he descended in Shu, in the *Dīngsì* (丁巳) year of the twenty-ninth year of *Zhāowáng* (昭王). After a thousand days, *Yǐn Xǐ* (尹喜) arrived in Shu, marking the time of their reunion. These three instances of descent are fixed in meaning.

**Second**, the timing of crossing the pass. Laozi crossed the pass westward in the *Guǐchǒu* (癸丑) year of the twenty-fifth year of *Zhāowáng* (昭王), meeting with the pass warden *Yǐn Xǐ* (尹喜) and thereby transmitting the two *Scriptures* of Dao/Way and Virtue/Power. After completing the transmission, in the *Jiǎyín* (甲寅) year of the twenty-sixth year, in the fourth month, he parted from *Yǐn Xǐ* (尹喜) at *Lóuguān* (楼观) and ascended to *Tàiwéi* (太微). In the *Dīngsì* (丁巳) year of the twenty-ninth year, *Yǐn Xǐ* (尹喜) entered Shu and sought Laozi, meeting him again at the *Qīngyáng* (青羊) market. In the *Wùwǔ* (戊午) year, he entered the *Liúshā* (流沙) region, marking the year and month of his crossing the pass.

Why? *Yǐn Xǐ* (尹喜) was a great official of King Kang, and by the time of *Zhāowáng* (昭王), he was the pass warden, meeting with Laozi. If we follow *Zāng Xuánjìng* (臧玄静), who claims Laozi crossed the pass westward during the reign of *Yōuwáng* (幽王), this contradicts the account of the Heavenly Treasure’s *Língfú* (灵符) descending, as the pass locations differ. Moreover, the first year of *Yōuwáng* (幽王) was *Gēngshēn* (庚申), and the eleventh year was *Gēngwǔ* (庚午), already destroyed—there is no *Guǐchǒu* (癸丑) within that year, making this claim erroneous.

Again, *Wén Rúhǎi* (文如海) states that Laozi crossed the pass in the *Guǐchǒu* (癸丑) year of the twenty-second year of *Chéngwáng* (成王), which contradicts the meeting with *Yǐn Xǐ* (尹喜), and is also incorrect.

Others claim he crossed the pass in the *Guǐchǒu* (癸丑) year of the forty-third year of *Píngwáng* (平王), which is far later in time and does not align with *Yǐn Xǐ*’s (尹喜) era—all these are mistaken accounts.

Now, upon careful examination of both ancient and modern accounts, the year **Guǐchǒu (癸丑)** of **Zhāowáng (昭王)**’s twenty-fifth year is established as the definitive time of Laozi’s crossing of the pass—this aligns chronologically without doubt.

**Third, regarding the timing of the *Sutra’s* transmission:**
*The Inner Transmission of Gé Xiān Gōng (葛仙公内传)* states that during the time of the Yellow Emperor, Laozi, as Guǎngchéngzǐ (广成子), expounded the *Dàodéjīng* and the Five *Jiā* (茄) methods.

Again, *The Five-Sage Appellation Diagram (应号五圣图)* and *The Inner Transmission of the Venerable Laozi (纪圣老君内传)* claim that during the reign of Shùn (舜), Laozi was known as Yín Shòuzǐ (尹寿子), residing in Héyáng (河阳), where he expounded the *Dàodéjīng* and taught the Dao of filial piety and fraternal respect (*xiàtì* 孝悌). Shùn practiced these virtues, retreated from power, and honored the Way while valuing virtue, thereby transforming the people of the realm. Thus, he established sixteen clans, exiled the Four Evildoers, attained the Four Hearings, and clarified the Four Sights. Externally, he pacified the common folk, and internally, he cherished the nine clans. He attained the Dao in the wilds of Chāngwú (苍梧) and Jiǔyí (九疑) Mountains.

Moreover, various accounts all state that during the reign of Zhāowáng (昭王) in the year **Guǐchǒu (癸丑)**, at Hán Gǔ Guān (函谷关), Laozi composed the two *Dàodé* treatises—*Upper* and *Lower Scriptures*—for Yǐn Xǐ (尹喜). The *Records of the Grand Historian (Shǐjì)* also states that Laozi, as the Overseer of Hán Gǔ Guān, Yǐn Xǐ, authored a book of over five thousand words.

Again, *The Lost Records of Wáng Zǐnián (王子年拾遗)* states that during the Zhou dynasty, Laozi resided on Jǐngshì Mountain (景室之山), often discussing the creation of Heaven and Earth with five senior sages, composing a work of ten thousand words, which he later condensed into five thousand words.

Now, according to the transmission from Héshànggōng (河上公) to Emperor Wéndì (文帝) of the *Upper* and *Lower Scriptures* with annotations, he said to the Emperor: *"Since I began annotating this *Sutra*, it has been over seventeen hundred years, passed down through three men, and now four generations."* He warned, *"Do not reveal it to those unworthy."*

Master Chéng Xuányīng (成玄英) explained: *"The three transmitters refer to Mù Guāng (务光), Xiànmén Zǐ (羡门子), and Gāoqiū Zǐ (高丘子)."*

From this, it is clear: *Zhuāngzǐ* states: *"Tāng (汤) conquered Jié (桀), then abdicated in favor of Mù Guāng, but Mù Guāng refused and drowned himself in the Qīnglíng Spring (清泠之泉) by embracing a stone."* Since Mù Guāng died during the time of Tāng, the transmission of the *Sutra* must have occurred before Jié’s reign. This sufficiently proves that the *Sutra* was not composed during Zhāowáng’s **Guǐchǒu (癸丑)** year or in Jǐngshì Mountain.

Again, referring to *The Yellow Emperor’s Book (黄帝书)*, it states: *"The Valley Spirit is immortal—this is called the Mysterious Female (玄牝)."* Since this entire chapter is preserved, it confirms that the *Sutra* was expounded during the Yellow Emperor’s time—that is why the Yellow Emperor’s writings cite this very chapter.

Furthermore, examining the chronology: if the *Sutra* were composed at Hán Gǔ Guān during Zhāowáng’s reign, by the time of Emperor Wéndì (文帝), less than a thousand years would have passed—this contradicts the claim that annotations had been made for over seventeen hundred years. Thus, it is clear that the *Sutra* was expounded during the Yellow Emperor’s time and annotated during Shùn’s reign, not specifically composed at Hán Gǔ Guān for Yǐn Xǐ’s five-thousand-word text.

Scholars of discernment should carefully consider this.

**Fourth, regarding the doctrinal intent and ultimate aim:**
The *Dàodé* scripture, revered as the supreme text, encompasses myriad meanings, its intent and direction varying with its adherents. Héshànggōng (河上公) and Yán Jūnping (严君平) elucidated the Way of governing the state, while Sōnglíng Xiānrén (松灵仙人), Sūn Dēng (孙登) of the Wèi dynasty, Táoyǐnjū (陶隐居) of the Liáng dynasty, and Gù Huān (顾欢) of the Nán Qí all expounded the Way of cultivating the self. Fú Jiān’s (符坚) time saw Luóshì (鸠摩罗什), Túdēng (图澄) of the Hòuzhào (后赵), Emperor Wǔ of the Liáng (梁武帝), and the Liáng Daoist Dòuliè (窦略), who clarified the principles of cause and effect in affairs. Daoists such as Mèng Zhìzhōu (孟智周), Zāng Xuánjìng (臧玄静) of the Liáng, Zhū Ráo (诸糅) of the Chén, Liú Jìnxǐ (刘进喜) of the Suí, Chéng Xuányīng (成玄英), Cài Zǐhuǎng (蔡子晃), Huáng Xuānnì (黄玄赜), Lǐ Róng (李荣), Chē Xuánbì (车玄弼), Zhāng Huìchāo (张惠超), and Lí Yuānxīng (黎元兴) of the Táng all expounded the *Chóngxuān* (重玄) Dao.

Hé Yàn (何晏), Zhōng Huì (钟会), Dù Yuánkǎi (杜元凯), Wáng Fǔsì (王辅嗣), Zhāng Sì (张嗣), Yáng Yòu (羊佑), Lú Shì (卢氏), and Liú Rénhuì (刘仁会) elucidated the principles of *Xūjí Wúwéi* (虚极无为)—both for personal cultivation and governance.

This demonstrates that the annotators’ intentions varied.

Moreover, the schools of learning and doctrinal foundations differ: Yán Jūnping (严君平) took *Xūxuān* (虚玄) as his core, Gù Huān (顾欢) took *Wúwéi* (无为), Mèng Zhìzhōu (孟智周) and Zāng Xuánjìng (臧玄静) took *Dàodé* (道德), Emperor Wǔ of the Liáng (梁武帝) took *Fēiyǒu Fēiwú* (非有非无), and Sūn Dēng (孙登) took *Chóngxuān* (重玄). Among these doctrinal stances, Sūn’s (孙氏) is the most profound.

Again, this *Sutra* takes *Zìrán* (自然) as its essence and *Dàodé* (道德) as its function. Those who cultivate it govern the state with *wúwéi* (无为) and *wúshì* (无事), thereby achieving *Tàipíng* (太平). For the self, they embrace *Bǎoyī* (抱一) and maintain *Shǒuzhōng* (守中), thus attaining Daoic fruition. Those who attain it transcend the void and ride the shadows, enduring longevity through prolonged vision.

For the state, the loss of *Dàodé* (道德) leads to inevitable ruin; for the self, its loss results in annihilation. Thus, the superior sage diligently upholds it as their standard.

Moreover, the *Mystic Preface to the Dàodé (道德玄序)* was issued in the twenty-first year of *Kāiyuán* (开元), dividing the text into:
- The **Upper Volume** (上卷), 49 chapters in 36 sections, corresponding to *Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter*;
- The **Lower Volume** (下卷), 59 chapters in 45 sections, corresponding to *Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth*.

Thus, the **Upper Volume**, from the first to the ninth chapter, takes *Wúxíng Wúmíng* (无形无名) as its core, elucidating the *Spring Dao*; from the tenth to the eighteenth chapter, it takes *Wúzhī Hūhuǎng* (无知惚恍) as its core, elucidating the *Summer Dao*;

From the nineteenth to the twenty-seventh chapter, it takes *Yǒujīng Yǒuxìn* (有精有信) as its core, elucidating the *Autumn Dao*; from the twenty-eighth to the thirty-sixth chapter, it takes *Níngzhòng Qīngjìng* (凝重清静) as its core, elucidating the *Winter Dao*.

In the **Lower Volume**, from the first to the ninth chapter, it elucidates *Réndé* (仁德); from the tenth to the eighteenth chapter, it elucidates *Lǐdé* (礼德); from the nineteenth to the twenty-seventh chapter, it elucidates *Yìdé* (义德); from the twenty-eighth to the thirty-sixth chapter, it elucidates *Zhìdé* (智德); from the thirty-seventh to the forty-fifth chapter, it elucidates *Xìndé* (信德).

*Rén* proceeds through *Lǚxū Bàoyī* (履虚抱一), *Lǐ* relies neither on *shì* (恃) nor *zǎi* (宰), *Yì* harmonizes through *róuruò hé tóng* (柔弱和同), *Zhì* remains in *wúshí bùxiào* (无识不肖), and *Xìn* adheres to *zhíqì bùzhēng* (执契不争).

Its overarching principle likewise takes *Xuānhū Huìkuò* (玄虚恢廓), *Chōngjì Xīwēi* (冲寂希微) as its essence, though nominally it comprises *Wǔ Yǒu Sì* (有五有四). In alignment with *lǐ* (理), it transcends *zhí* (执) and *wéi* (为).

Yet among those who expound, adherence to the text often leads to errors, and the interpretations of scholars past and present are sometimes incomplete. Now, by broadly citing diverse texts and exhaustively examining their intent, the discerning may adopt what is clear, thereby illuminating the chronological order, doctrinal tendencies, and distinctions between right and wrong in the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng Guāngshèngyì* (道德真经广圣义).

**End of Volume Five of the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng Guāngshèngyì***
**Volume Six of the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng Guāngshèngyì***

**Volume Six of the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng Guāngshèngyì* (Continued)**

**Commentary on the First Chapter: "The Dao That Can Be Spoken" (道可道)**

This chapter elucidates the origin of the **Dao/Way** (道) and the root of all transformations. ○
**Explanation:** This (此) is that (斯). Chapter (章) means to clarify (明), to distinguish sections and divisions so that principles and meanings become evident. The *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) states: "A completed song is called a chapter." The character 章, composed of 音 (sound) and 十 (ten), signifies the completion of a count from one to ten. When referring to writing, 章 means that whenever the *Classics of Poetry* (《Shījīng》) or *Odes* (《Yǎ》) have distinct passages, they are called chapters. To clarify (明) is to make it bright and pure, to reveal it clearly. The **Dao/Way** (妙本), as the essence of all mysteries, stands at the beginning of the *Scripture*, marking the origin of the **Dao/Way**.

Origin (由) means to follow (从); rise (起) means to flourish (兴). Ten thousand (万) denotes the vastness of numbers (数). Transformation (化) refers to responding to changes (应变), meaning that all things arise and change from the **Dao/Way**. Root (宗) means master (主); source (源) means origin (本). Since all transformations arise from the **Dao/Way**, knowing the **Dao/Way** is the root and master of all transformations. This chapter begins, giving rise to all phenomena, like the source of water flowing endlessly without depletion.

**Commentary:** The opening marks the **strong name** (强名) of *Ultimate Void* (虚极), summarizing the return of all mysteries to their source. ○
**Explanation:** The opening (首) is the beginning (元), the start (始). The *Ěryǎ* (尔雅) states: "The first is the foundation (首基), the beginning (始)." To mark (标) is to raise (举). *Ultimate Void* (虚极) is the **Dao/Way** (妙本). The **strong name** (强名) is the **Dao/Way** (道). This chapter first establishes the **Dao/Way** that can be spoken (可道) as its essence (体), and the **Dao/Way** that can be named (可名) as its function (用). In the final passage, it gathers all mysteries into this gate, tracing their manifestations back to their root. To return (趣) means to incline toward (向), to return once again to the **Dao/Way**'s origin. Within this gate, it is divided into seven distinctions:

1. **The Dao/Way that can be spoken and named** (可道可名) clarifies essence and function. **Explanation:** Essence and function (体用) are mutually dependent. Essence has no fixed form, and function has no fixed application; without function, essence cannot be revealed, and without essence, function cannot stand. Sometimes essence is absent, sometimes present; sometimes it is real, sometimes latent; sometimes manifest, sometimes empty; sometimes named, sometimes symbolized. They mutually constitute essence and function, alternating to clarify each other. Essence (体) refers to form (形) and surface (肤); function (用) refers to dependence (资) and application (以).

2. **The Dao/Way that has no name and yet can be named** (无名有名) clarifies root and trace. **Explanation:** Root and trace (本迹) are mutually generative. When there is a root (本), the trace (迹) arises; the trace reveals the root, and without a root, the trace cannot be shown, nor can the root be sought without the trace. The trace is established through phenomena (事), serving as the root and trace. The root (本) is the foundation (根); the trace (迹) is the end (末). The *Master Guāngchéng* (广成先生) said to *Comrade Nǐ* (仲尼): "The Six Classics (六经) are the traces of ancient sages (先王)." The trace (迹) is what remains after walking (履), but the trace is not the walking itself. The trace arises from walking, yet if one takes the trace as walking and further makes others walk upon it, one only grows more distant from the **Dao/Way**. Thus, the trace is the end (末).

3. **Clarifying the presence and absence of desire** (有欲无欲) elucidates the two perspectives. **Explanation:** Perspective (观) is the path one treads (行). To observe (观) with the eyes is called *official observation* (音官); to perceive (观) with the spirit is called *piercing observation* (音贯). One attends to all external things, while the mind concentrates inward; inwardly, one illuminates the singular heart (一心), and outwardly, one forgets all phenomena (万象)—this is called perspective (观). It serves as the initial step in Daoist practice (习道) and the gradual path to cultivating the True (修真). First, one relies on observation and practice (观行), then enters the mysterious gate (妙门). The **Dao/Way** cannot be obtained by naming or sought through form, so observation and practice become the means of cultivation. It is said: "Desire leads to death (有欲归於死), absence of desire aligns with life (无欲契於生)," thus the perspectives on life and death diverge (归趣不同).

4. **The same origin, different names** (同出异名) clarifies how the **Primordial Simplicity** (大朴) disperses into forms. **Explanation:** The **Primordial Simplicity** (大朴) is the **Dao/Way** (道). The **Dao/Way** disperses into *Spirit Manifest* (神明), flows into sun and moon (日月), differentiates into the Five Phases (五行), and gives rise to all things (万物). Forms (器) possess shape and function. The *Yìjīng* (易经) states: "What transcends form is called the **Dao/Way**; what is beneath form is called the form."

5. **Calling it the Dao/Way is called *Ultimate Void*** (同谓之玄) clarifies how forms return to the **Primordial Simplicity**. **Explanation:** *Spirit Manifest* (神明), sun and moon (日月), the Five Phases (五行), and all things (万物) have shape and form, yet all converge back into the **Dao/Way**, hence it is said they return to the **Primordial Simplicity** (复朴).

6. **The Dao/Way beyond the Dao/Way** (玄之又玄) distinguishes the duality of discernment and forgetting. **Explanation:** When forms arise (为器), the **Primordial Simplicity** (朴) must still be preserved. After returning to the **Primordial Simplicity**, even this is forgotten, and one aligns with the **Dao/Way**. Thus, it is called the **Dao/Way beyond the Dao/Way**. Dual forgetting (兼忘) means both form and **Primordial Simplicity** are forgotten.

7. **The gate of all mysteries** (众妙之门) shows the path of completed practice and transcendence. **Explanation:** When both form and **Primordial Simplicity** are forgotten, one clearly aligns with the **Dao/Way**, then returns to the beginning of life and transformation—the gate of all mysteries. Humans and all things share the same origin in the **Dao/Way**; if one acts with contrivance (有为) or clings to desire (有欲), one loses the **Dao/Way** and harms life. If one removes desire and maintains harmony (守和), one returns to the root and origin. This is called the essential gate of knowing the **Dao/Way**.

**Commentary:** The **Dao/Way** (道) is the **strong name** of *Ultimate Void* (虚极) and *Mysterious Origin* (妙本), encompassing both thoroughfares (通) and paths (径).
**Explanation:** The **Dao/Way** (道) is the *Ultimate Void* (至虚至极), neither shape nor sound. It precedes all ages and transformations (后劫运), yet is neither the beginning nor the end before heaven and earth (先天地). It is *Round and Passable, Pure and Tranquil* (圆通澄寂), without beginning or end. The sages reveal its function of giving rise to all things (通生之用), and by tracing its traces (寻迹), one may awaken to its origin (本). Thus, the **Dao/Way** is named by its virtue of giving rise to all things (通生之德).

**Commentary:** The single character *Dao/Way* (道) marks the central principle.
**Explanation:** The opening character *Dao/Way* (道) in the *Scripture* marks and raises the central principle.

**Commentary:** The **Dao/Way that can be spoken** (可道) indicates that this *Mysterious Origin* (妙本) gives rise to all things, thus all things follow this path and can be called the **Dao/Way**, hence *the **Dao/Way that can be spoken***.
**Explanation:** The character *Dao/Way* (道) marks the central principle—*non-action* (无为) and *non-form* (无形), the essence of the **Dao/Way**. The two characters *可道* signify *giving rise to life and transformation* (有生有化), the function of the **Dao/Way**. Within these three characters, essence and function are inherently established: essence is ineffable, function boundless.

「Thus, it is the *Mysterious Origin* of the *Void’s Extremity* (虚极).  **Explanation:** *The Dao/Way that is not constant* (非常道) signifies that the *Mysterious Origin* (妙本) gives rise to transformation (生化), its function unbounded (用无定方), and thus it is given a name that cannot be exhaustively enumerated. Hence, it appears sometimes as vast (大) and sometimes as fleeting (逝), sometimes as distant (远) and sometimes as returning (返)—this is the *Dao/Way that is not constant*.

**Explanation:** It disperses as all things (散为万物), yet does not adhere to a single form. Therefore, its function is without fixed direction (用无定方). Yet it is rooted in the singular *Dao/Way*, so it is made clear that all things derive from *Dao/Way’s transformation* (道化). Hence, it is not confined to exhaustive enumeration. It is lofty yet without limit (高而无上), encompassing all without exclusion (无不包容)—this is *vastness* (大). It is lofty yet without limit (高而无上), not lingering above (不滞於上), boundless yet without external constraint (大而无外), not lingering externally (不滞於外)—this is *fleeting* (逝). *Fleeting* (逝) means *to depart* (往). It reaches the limitless (穷於无穷), penetrating everywhere (无所不通)—this is *distant* (远). It maintains a *Void-heart* (虚心) and abides in the singular (守一), the *Dao/Way* returning to its source (道复归之)—this is *returning* (返). *Returning* (返) means *to restore* (还).

This passage draws from the *Dao/Way Scripture* (《道经》), Chapter Twenty-Five: *"From the *Mysterious Origin* (有物), all things arise."* Thus, it is proven that *the Dao/Way that is not constant* (非常道) is the *Dao/Way* that does not abide in a fixed place (不常厥所).

**Explanation:** The *Dao/Way* (道) is the *Mysterious Origin* of boundless function (虚极之妙用); the *Name* (名) is the designation by which things attain it (物得之所称). Its function can be applied to all things (用可於物), hence it is called *the Dao/Way that can be spoken* (可道). Names arise from its function (名生於用), hence it is called *the Dao/Way that can be named* (可名). Since its application is without fixed form (应用者无方), it is not constant in one *Dao/Way*; since things differ and names vary (物殊而名异), it is not constant in one *Name*. Thus, it is given the name *Dao/Way*, yet *the Dao/Way* itself is ever without name.

**Explanation:** *Name* (名) is the proper designation (正言). The opening character *Dao/Way* (道) is the root of naming. The two characters *可名* signify the traces of naming. These traces disperse among things (迹散在物), and all things are designated differently (称谓万殊). When the traces return to the root, they align with the *Dao/Way*. Thus, *the Dao/Way* is the root of naming, and naming is the manifestation of the *Dao/Way*. Root and manifestation mutually give rise, completing transformation (化).

**Explanation:** *The Dao/Way that can be named* (可名) signifies that names arise from function (名生於用), and thus can be established. *The Dao/Way that is not constant in name* (非常名) appears as *Clear* (清) in Heaven, *Tranquil* (宁) on Earth, *Responsive* (灵) in the Spirit, and *Fulfilling* (盈) in the Valley. Though *the One* is attained without distinction, its application yields varied names. Hence, it is not constant in one *Name*, and thus it is called *the Dao/Way that is not constant in name*.

**Explanation:** Without function, the *Dao/Way* congeals (无用则道凝); with function, names are established (有用则名立). Heaven attains the *Dao/Way* and manifests the *Clear* (清明); Earth attains the *Dao/Way* and becomes *Firm and tranquil* (确然安静); the Spirit attains the *Dao/Way* and transforms without ceasing (变化不歇); the Valley attains the *Dao/Way* and is *fulfilled without deficiency* (盈满无亏). This passage draws from the succeeding Chapter Two to elucidate its meaning. Names disperse without limit—this is *the Dao/Way that is not constant in name*.

*The Dao/Way without name* (无名) is the origin of Heaven and Earth. **Explanation:** *The Dao/Way without name* (无名) is the *Mysterious Origin* of the *Void’s Extremity* (虚极妙本), before any name was imposed. The *Mysterious Origin* (妙本) at its beginning was not *without name* (无名); from the root, *qi* descends (从本降气), and the division of Heaven and Earth commences (开辟天地). Heaven and Earth rely on this origin (天地相资以为始), hence it is called *the Dao/Way without name* (无名) at the beginning of Heaven and Earth.

**Explanation:** The *Great Dao/Way* (大道) emits *qi*, spreading through the *Void* (布於虚无), as the foundation of Heaven and Earth (为天地之本). At the beginning, there was no *Dao/Way without name*—as the *Zhuangzi* states in *"The Heaven and Earth"* (□天地篇): *"In the beginning of the beginning (泰初), there was the *Void* (有无); the *Void* had no name (无名)."* The *Void* (无) being without name (无名), it cannot be interrogated by names; it is obscure and tranquil (混漠寂寥), boundless as the master of transformation (邈为化主). The *Original Qi* (元气) draws upon it as the origin (资之以为始), and the *Dark Transformation* (玄化) receives it to attain life (禀之而得生). Hence, it is called *the Dao/Way without name*.

Heaven and Earth, at their beginning, had no name and no master (无名无氏). Then, traces descended (然后降迹), gradually forming signs (渐令兆形), and thus Heaven and Earth were born (由此而天地生), and the *qi* of phenomena established (气象立矣).

**Explanation:** The *Great Ultimate* (太极) of the *I Ching* (《易》) gives rise to the *Two Principles* (两仪), the *Two Principles* to the *Three Talents* (三才), and the *Three Talents* to all things (万物). According to the *Er Ya* (《尔雅》), *"The beginning"* (权舆) is the origin. The *Er Ya*, created by Duke Zhou (周公) to instruct King Cheng (成王), is a compendium of knowledge on birds, beasts, grasses, and trees, elucidating the meanings and correspondences of words, distinguishing those that are similar in reality yet differ in designation. It serves as the bridge for the Nine Schools (九流) and the key for the Six Arts (六艺), a deep well for those who survey learning and a garden of flowers for those who wield the brush.

This text flourished in the *Middle Antiquity* (中古), reaching its zenith under the Han (隆於汉氏). *Middle Antiquity* refers to the era between the Five Emperors (五帝) and the Three Kings (三王). Hence, the *Systematic Commentary* (《易□系》) of the *I Ching* says: *"The author of the *I Ching* was in the Middle Antiquity."*

*The Dao/Way with name* (有名) is the mother of all things (万物之母). **Explanation:** *The Dao/Way without name* (无名) is the *Mysterious Origin* (妙本). When the *Mysterious Origin* manifests *qi*, Heaven and Earth emerge (见气权舆天地). Heaven and Earth rely on this origin (天地资始), hence it is called *the Dao/Way without name*. *The Dao/Way with name* (有名) is the application and cultivation of phenomena (应用匠成), nurturing all things (茂养万物). Things receive their nourishment, hence it is called *the Dao/Way with name*.

**Explanation:** *The Dao/Way with name* (有名) is the application of function (应用), and the application establishes a name (匠成). Once all transformations are complete (万化既作) and phenomena take form (品物生成), the *Mysterious Origin* (妙本) permeates through all, providing sustenance to humanity. Thus, it is called the *mother*—for its nourishing abundance (母以茂养为义). Yet, whether named or unnamed, the sages distinguish the *Dao/Way* by its function to clarify the unity and diversity of root and trace (本迹之同异), for the *Dao/Way* is not confined to having or not having a name.

**Explanation:** *All transformations* (万化) refer to the myriad changes (举其多). *Phenomena* (品物) are the myriad things (众物). Among all things, the *Dao/Way* is present without exception (道无不在), even in the finest hair of an autumn deer (秋毫之细). Thus, it can generate the *Three Talents* (三才) and be the mother of all things (万物). When the *Dao/Way* is present in all things, they live; when the *Dao/Way* departs, they die. The utmost nourishment is contained—is it not called the *mother*?

The *Great Dao/Way* is without distinction or similarity (无异无同), without root or trace (无本无迹). Yet, through imposed teachings, root and trace are made manifest (强立言教，而本迹彰矣). To observe its mystery, one must be without desire (常无欲以观其妙); to observe its limits, one must have desire (常有欲以观其徼).

**Explanation:** Humanity is born in stillness (人生而静), this is the nature of Heaven (天之性); when stirred by phenomena, it moves (感物而动), this is the nature of desire (性之欲).

If one constantly upholds **cleanness and stillness** (清静), frees the mind and releases the spirit (解心释神), and returns to reflect upon one’s true nature (反照正性), then one perceives the **wondrous root** (妙本).

If one does not restrain its passions (不性其情), follows desire and moves with it (遂欲而动), the nature is lost to desire (性失於欲), and one is bewildered by the **source of the Dao/Way** (道源). When one seeks to observe the wondrous root through desire, only its **boundaries** (边徼) are seen.

**Explanation:** Desire is the movement of nature (欲者，性之动), meaning the mind arises as one pursues the phenomena.

It is said that when humanity is without desire (常无欲), its nature is pure and still (正性清静), returning to reflect upon the Dao’s source (反照道源), then one perceives and observes the wondrous root (观见妙本矣).

If one is always with desire (常有欲), pursuing phenomena and giving rise to the mind, then nature is disrupted by desire (性为欲乱). When one observes the root through desire, lacking **harmony and balance** (冲和), only its boundaries are seen (但见边徼矣).

**Boundary** (徼) is the **edge** (边).

**Explanation:** The mechanical mind (机械之心) resides within the chest; though it is not entirely pure (纯白), it is not entirely impure (不粹), and the spirit’s **virtue/power** (神德) is not complete. One who merely preserves the body (存身者) is not in harmony (不和), and this is the state of having desire (此有欲也).

If the mind of harming desire (欲害之心) is forgotten within, then one may walk upon a tiger’s tail (虎尾可履), and what more of humanity (况於人乎)! This is the state of being without desire (此无欲也).

Those with desire (有欲者) rely on the ears and eyes for perception and hearing (任耳目以视听), labor the mind and thoughts to reason (劳心虑以为理). The more they perceive and hear, the more they are lost in confusion (视听逾迷); the more they reason, the more they are disordered (为理愈乱). This may be called seeing only the boundaries (可谓见边徼矣).

Those without desire (无欲者) allow their spirit to merge with emptiness (神合於虚), their **qi** to merge with nothingness (气合於无). They reach everywhere without obstruction (无所不达), penetrate everywhere without hindrance (无所不通), and align their function with that of Heaven and Earth (与天地同功). This is the **Great Harmony** (大通), and it may be called observing its wondrousness (可谓观其妙矣).

**Observation** (观) involves externally surveying with the eyes (外以目周览) and internally illuminating with the spirit (内以神照微). Surveying with the eyes distinguishes the presence and absence of things (目览则辩乎有无); illuminating with the spirit aligns with the **profound silence** (契乎冥寂).

The phrase **"Humanity is born in stillness"** (人生而静) is from the *Record of Music* (《乐记》篇). It states that nature is originally pure and still (性本清静), without desire or scheming (无欲无营). When moved by external phenomena (为物所感), desire arises from the conditions (因境生欲). The movement comes from the outside (感於外), yet the stirrings are within (动於内). How could one not be cautious of what moves them?

Thus, the **Sage** (圣人) establishes **law** (法) to curb its **evil** (邪), **rites** (礼) to curb its **disorder** (乱), **punishments** (刑) to curb its **transgressions** (过), and **music** (乐) to curb its **excesses** (淫). To govern desire with the Dao/Way (以道制欲) is how one teaches the people to **revere virtue and diligently seek good** (崇德务善).

These two are **of the same source but different names** (同出而异名).
**Explanation:** Both of these (as mentioned above) originate from the Dao/Way (本於道), hence they are said to be of the same source (故云同也). Movement arises from application (动出应用); names are established according to their use (随用立名), hence the names are different (则名异矣).

**Explanation:** This refers to the matters discussed above. The two (可道可名、无名有名，无欲有欲) are each their own pair (各自其两), hence called the two (两者). They both receive the wondrous root (俱禀妙本), hence they are of the same source (同出). From the root downwards, names are established according to their use, hence they are different (名异).

**Explanation:** When **One Qi** (一气) divides, the **Ten Thousand Transformations** (万化) arise. When forms and signs are established (形兆立), the **Ten Thousand Things** (万有) manifest. The variations of these three (三者之变) each produce their own pair (各而两之), emerging from **nothingness** (无), as is said here.

The Dao/Way becomes manifest (道显) and names are established (名立); names are established (名立) and desire arises (欲生). This is the Dao/Way that can be spoken of and named (有道可言，有名可谓). Desire’s impulse (有欲之机) is generated here (兴於此矣). This is how **trace** (迹) arises from **root** (本).

If one who **retrieves the trace** (摄迹) abandons desire and forgets names (弃欲忘名), returning to the wondrous root (复归妙本), then in the Dao/Way one forgets the Dao/Way (於道忘道), and in names one forgets names (於名忘名). This is called **returning to the root** (还本).

Those who **follow their emotions** (徇情者) chase desire and forget the root (逐欲忘本), sinking into **slippery excess** (沦滑). If they can return to the **initial state of things** (物初), they may speak of the **Supreme Dao/Way** (至道).

They are called **profound** (玄).
**Explanation:** When they emerge, their names are different (出则名异); when they are of the same source, they are called **profound** (同则谓玄). **Profound** (玄) means **deep and wondrous** (深妙).

**Explanation:** **Profound** (玄) means **deep and wondrous** (深妙). When discussing their emergence, their names differ (自出而论则名异), meaning they descend from root to trace (是从本而降迹也). When discussing their unity, they are deep and wondrous (自同而论则深妙), meaning they retrieve the trace and return to the root (是摄迹以归本也). Returning to the root is deep and wondrous, hence it is called **profound** (归本则深妙故谓之玄).

**Explanation:** People with and without desire (有欲无欲之人) all receive **qi** from Heaven and Earth (受气於天地). If they receive **harmonious and balanced** (中和) **qi** and **nourishing fluids** (滋液), they become **virtuous and Sage-like** (贤圣) and **without action** (无为). If they receive **polluted and disordered** (浊乱) **qi**, they become **confused and foolish** (昏愚) and **filled with desire** (多欲).

If one can **purify the mind and change their thoughts** (洗心易虑), **clarify desire and embrace emptiness** (澄欲含虚), then they are those who retrieve the trace and return to the root (摄迹归本之人).

If humanity can **refine and cultivate** (修炼), transforming the **coarse into the pure** (俗变淳和), then the **wind of returning to simplicity** (返朴之风) may reach the **Great Antiquity** (太古).

**Profound yet again profound** (玄之又玄), the **gateway to all wondrousness** (众妙之门).
**Explanation:** If the **causal factors** (因) do not arise, then they are unified in **profound wondrousness** (同乎玄妙). Yet fearing that one might cling to **profound** as a fixed state (执玄为滞), not reaching **dual forgetting**, one speaks of **profound yet again profound** (又玄) to dispel **profound**, demonstrating **desirelessness within desirelessness** (示明无欲於无欲).

Those who can do this perceive all **Dharma/Law** (万法) arising from it (由之而了出), hence it is called the **gateway to all wondrousness** (众妙之门).

**Explanation:** Retrieving the trace and returning to the root is called **deep wondrousness** (深妙). If one dwells in this wondrousness (住斯妙), the trace still exists (其迹复存), and though its name differs (与彼异名), it is equal without distinction (等无差别). Hence, **profound yet again profound** (又玄) is spoken to dispel **profound**, so that one does not cling to **profound** (不滞於玄). When root and trace are both forgotten (本迹两忘), this is called **non-abiding** (无住). Non-abiding leads to **perception** (了出).

**Explanation:** The phrase **"causal factors"** (意因) is from the *Western Ascension Scripture* (《西升经》), which states: **"Of the same source but different names"** (同出异名色), each generating its own **causal factors** (各自生意因). If one does not generate **causal factors** (令不生意因), then they are unified in **profound wondrousness** (同於玄妙). **Desirelessness within desirelessness** (无欲於无欲) means that one seeks to eliminate desire (欲求无欲), yet has not yet left the mind of desire (未离欲心). When desire is truly gone (既无有欲), even the idea of desirelessness is forgotten (亦无无欲). To dispel even the dispelling (遣之又遣), this may be called **completely forgetting the mind** (都亡心).

**Explanation:** Retrieving the trace and forgetting names (摄迹忘名) has already attained its wondrousness (已得其妙). Yet fearing that one might cling to this wondrousness (於妙恐滞), one forgets it again (故复忘之), meaning root and trace are both forgotten (是本迹俱忘).

Again forgetting this forgetting (又忘此忘), one **kisses and aligns with the Dao/Way** (吻合乎道). Desire, once dispelled (有欲既遣), and desirelessness, once forgotten (无欲亦忘), neither clings to presence or absence (不滞有无), nor to the **middle path** (不执中道). This is the **fulfillment of complete forgetting** (契都忘之者尔).

**Explanation:** When observing is done as such (正观若斯), this is called **all wondrousness** (众妙). Though its wondrousness is manifold (虽众), they all emerge from this gateway (皆出此门). Hence it is called the **gateway to all wondrousness** (众妙之门).

**Explanation:** The **gateway to all wondrousness** (众妙门) is the **Heavenly Gate** (天门). The **Heavenly Gate** (天门) is the **collective name for the origin of all Dharma/Law** (万法所生之总名). Though it is called **without presence** (无有), it is said that all things emerge from **nothingness** (无有), return to **nothingness** (入乎无有), gathering and scattering, hiding and appearing (聚散隐显), hence it has the name of **emerging and returning** (故有出入之名尔).

It is merely a name in form (徒有其名), yet in reality there is no such gate (实无其门). Hence it is called the **Gate of Non-Action** (无为之门), meaning there is no gate (则无门也). Without gate or room (无门无房), it is the **vast and boundless** (四达之皇皇), returning to the **wondrous Dao/Way** (归於妙道).

Through **progressive contemplation** (正观), one ascends the stages of Dao/Way realization—from initial cultivation to ultimate enlightenment. What was earlier called **visible perception** (目见) is the **contemplation of the Official of Vision** (观音官览之观). **Divine illumination** (神照) is the **pervasive contemplation of the Official of Vision** (观音贯行之观).

The Dao/Way progresses through **the Three Vehicles’ teachings** (三乘之法), guiding beings in stages from their first awakening to the ultimate Dao/Way. Discarding the mundane to attain sainthood, it establishes **the Fourteen Grades of Contemplation and Practice** (一十四等观行之门).

The **Small Vehicle’s** initial contemplations comprise **three methods** (三观法):
1. **Contemplation of False Dharma** (假法观) — this is **holding fast to relative appearances** (对持);
2. **Contemplation of True Dharma** (实法观) — this is **the mind’s self-illumination** (心照);
3. **Contemplation of Pervasive Emptiness** (遍空观) — entering **Non-Action** (无为).

The **Middle Vehicle’s** contemplation and practice consist of **four stages** (四观):
1. **Contemplation of Impermanence** (无常观);
2. **Contemplation of Permanence** (入常观);
3. **Contemplation of Non-Impermanence** (入非无常观);
4. **Contemplation of Non-Permanence** (非常观).

The **Great Vehicle’s** contemplation and practice also comprise **four stages** (四观):
1. **Contemplation of Wondrous Existence** (妙有观);
2. **Contemplation of Wondrous Non-Existence** (妙无观);
3. **Contemplation of Double Mystery** (重玄观);
4. **Contemplation of Non-Double Mystery** (非重玄观).

Within the **Saints’ Gate** (圣何门), there are **three further contemplations** (三观):
1. **Contemplation of True Emptiness** (真空观);
2. **Contemplation of True Permeation** (真洞观);
3. **Contemplation of True Non-Existence** (真无观).

Through these contemplations, one refines the mind—**from existence to non-existence** (从有入无), ascending from coarse to wondrous. Upon attaining the wondrous, one **forgets its wondrousness** (忘其妙), thus aligning with the **Gate of Non-Action** (无为之门).

**Non-Action** (无为) and **Action** (有为), **Dao/Way** (可道) and **Constant Dao/Way** (常道), **Substance** (体) and **Function** (用)—these dualities are clearly articulated. Now, within the **Gate of Substance and Function** (体用门), they are divided into **five distinctions** (五别):

1. **Non-Existence as Substance, Existence as Function** (以无为体，以有为用):
   **Dao/Way** (可道) is the **Substance-Dao/Way** (体道), which is **fundamentally non-existent** (本无);
   **Name** (可名) is the **Functional Name** (用名), which **entails relative existence** (涉有).

2. **Existence as Substance, Non-Existence as Function** (以有为体，以无为用):
   **Chambers, carriages, and instruments** (室车器) are **Substance of Existence** (有为体), while their **utilization** (以无为用) is **Non-Existence** (无).

3. **Non-Existence as Substance and Function** (以无为体，以无为用):
   **Naturalness** (自然) is the **Substance of Non-Existence** (无为体), while **interdependent causes and conditions** (因缘) are its **Functional Non-Existence** (无为用).
   All this is **pure Non-Existence** (此皆无也).

4. **Existence as Substance and Function** (以有为体，以有为用):
   **Heaven and Earth** (天地) are the **Substance of Existence** (有为体), while **all things** (万物) are its **Functional Existence** (有为用).
   All this is **pure Existence** (此皆有也).

5. **Non-Existence-Non-Existence as Substance and Function** (以非有非无为体，非有非无为用):
   **Dao/Way** (道) is the **Substance of Non-Existence-Non-Existence** (非有非无为体), while **virtue/power** (德) is its **Functional Non-Existence-Non-Existence** (为用).
   This is **the Dao/Way as Substance, Virtue/Power as Function** (道为体，德为用也).

Again, within the **Gate of Origin and Manifestation** (本迹门), they are divided into **two distinctions** (二别):
1. **Non-Existence as Origin, Existence as Manifestation** (以无为本，以有为迹):
   **Non-Naming** (无名) is **the Origin of Existence** (有名也).
2. **Existence as Origin, Non-Existence as Manifestation** (以有为本，以无为迹):
   **Mutual Clarification** (互相明也).

All things **originate from Existence and return to Non-Existence** (自有而终，归於无也). The **Mysterious Source** (玄源) is **serene and quiescent** (澄寂), the **Wondrous Origin** (妙本) is **profoundly obscure** (杳冥). It is **not a form or image that can be sought** (非言象可求), nor **Non-Existence that can be substantiated** (非无有可质). Indeed, it is **the end of all logical inquiry** (讨论理绝), **the exhaustion of all speculative discourse** (拟议道穷), yet still, **the teachings are established to guide the mundane** (设教引凡), **demonstrating these stages** (示兹阶级).

However, **in the realm of intuitive understanding and spontaneous resonance** (冥心感契), **gradual or sudden realization follows individual capacity** (顿随机), and one **must not cling to teachings or fixate on words** (不可滞教执文), nor **be constrained by scholastic appearances** (拘於学相). Aspiring **to purify the heart and bathe in virtue/power** (澡心浴德之士), **be diligent and earnest in your efforts** (勤乎勉哉).

「The Master Guangcheng of the Tang Dynasty, Du Guangting, expounds:

**Chapter Twenty: All Under Heaven Know**

Explication: The previous chapter elucidates the subtle source of generation and transformation, distinguishing between the two contemplations. This chapter clarifies the undifferentiated and dispersed with varied names.

**The myriad distinctions arise from attachment to phenomena, and attachment leads to wandering.** (因万殊而逐境，逐境则流浪) **Yet true transformation returns to the root.** (善化则归根) Hence, it first marks the delusions of desire as beautiful, good, or false; then shows the inclinations toward being or non-being; and concludes with the sage’s principle, hoping to swiftly restore the original simplicity. (冀速还淳之由)

The text states: The vast and teeming paths of existence, the myriad living beings in their restless motion,—when they enter phenomena, emotions arise, and the farther they stray from the Dao, the more distant they become. The sage pities their forgetfulness of return and opens this wondrous gate.

The previous chapter distinguished the two contemplations, entering from non-being into being. This chapter reveals the six delusions, arising from attachment to events and their shifting appearances. If one knows the error of chasing phenomena and does not follow the changes of wandering, then one may speak of the gradual cultivation of an empty heart and a full belly.

**All under Heaven know beauty as beauty, and thus it is not evil.** (天下皆知美之为美，斯恶已) **All know goodness as goodness, and thus it is not ungood.** (皆知善之为善，斯不善已)

**Annotation:** Beauty and goodness arise from the heart of desire. If the heart seeks what it desires, even evil may be deemed beautiful or good. Hence, it is said that all know what they deem beautiful as beauty and what they deem good as goodness.

Without an inherent master, both beauty and goodness are false emotions, arising from distinctions of being and non-being, ease and difficulty, the divine and the profane, the fragrant and the foul—all competing to sway and deceive. The Great Sage, through profound discernment, knows these as empty illusions, hence, **"thus it is not evil."** (恶已)

**Explication:** "All under Heaven" refers to the great multitude, speaking of all beneath the heavens. Beauty is what the heart finds pleasing; goodness is what the body practices. It says that all people know what their hearts find pleasing as beauty and what their bodies practice as goodness. Hence, the discussion of preferring sweet over bitter, favoring red over plain—these mutual inclinations give rise to contention and disputes, all stemming from the stirring of desire, which in turn leads to the sequential formation of beauty and evil.

The sage knows that beauty and evil have no inherent master, that both are false emotions, and since false emotions are not constant, it is said, **"thus it is not evil."** (恶已) "Already" (已) is a grammatical particle. The annotation mentions "the divine and the profane" (神奇臭腐), which is from Zhuangzi: *"What is deemed beautiful is the divine and the fragrant; what is deemed evil is the profane and the foul."* (所美为神奇，所恶为臭腐)

The text states: Among all under Heaven, those who know the Dao are few, while the common and vulgar are many; those who know self-cultivation are few, while those who follow external things are many. (天下之人知道者稀，常俗者众；知修身者寡，徇物者多)

All know that beauty and virtue are right, yet none can practice them;
All know that vice and evil are wrong, yet none can abandon them.
The sage laments this, hence it is said: *"Evil is already past," "Vice is already past."*

To bear virtue and conceal righteousness,
To embrace the Dao and maintain humility,
To be loyal and filial toward sovereign and kin,
To cherish harmony among friends and kin—
These are the deeds of beauty and virtue,
Yet all know them yet cannot perform them.
To act contrary to these is vice,
Yet all know them yet cannot reform.

How much more so in cultivating the Way of *wuwei*?
Thus, it is worthy of lamentation.

*"Mao"* (妄) means that which is not true and real.
When stirred by circumstances, thoughts arise;
When following things, emotions are born.
If one does not abide by the Dao or conform to constancy,
Then one is deluded.

*"Divine and fragrant, foul and putrid"*—
From *Zhuangzi*, *Northern Expedition*:
The Yellow Emperor said to Zhi:
*"All things are one.
What is deemed divine and fragrant is what is deemed beautiful;
What is deemed foul and putrid is what is deemed evil.
Foul and putrid transform into divine and fragrant,
Divine and fragrant transform into foul and putrid—
Thus it is said: ‘It is the unified *qi* that pervades all under Heaven.’
The sage values unity."*

This clarifies that divine and fragrant, foul and putrid
Are the partial natures of things.
A hundred schools differ in doctrine,
Nine currents vary in name,
Sequentially grasping right and wrong,
Mutually generating praise and blame.

Those who govern the body and the realm,
If they practice *wuwei* and follow things,
With unity as their thread,
Then divine and fragrant, foul and putrid
Naturally become one—no duality.

Thus, *you* and *wu* (having and non-having) generate each other.
*Commentary:* This clarifies the emptiness of *you* and *wu*.
That which is has no self-nature;
It arises through *wu*, yet the vulgar claim *wu* generates *you*.
That which is not has no self-nature;
It arises through *you*, yet the vulgar claim *you* generates *wu*.
Thus it is said they generate each other,
But the duality of *you* and *wu* is not their true nature—
The name "generation" arises from delusion,
Just as beauty and evil do not arise from inherent nature—
All are empty.
Thus the sage, desiring to rescue those lost in confusion,
Speaks of these six delusions.

*Commentary:* Laozi laments that the common folk are lost in the true Dao,
Deluded by false attachments,
Entangled in illusory emotions,
Hence this meaning is made clear to dispel their fixation.

*"Existence"* (执) means attachment.
To cling to *you* is to reject *wu*;
To cling to *wu* is to reject *you*;
To cling to difficulty is to reject ease;
To cling to ease is to reject difficulty;
To cling to shortness is to reject length;
To cling to length is to reject shortness;
To cling to high is to reject low;
To cling to low is to reject high;
To cling to what comes after is to reject what comes before;
To cling to what comes before is to reject what comes after.
Because of this attachment, none reach ultimate truth,
Hence the scripture says: *"The attached lose."*

But without partial attachment,
One naturally aligns with the Middle Way,
And enters the gate of profound and true observation.

Difficulty and ease generate each other.
*Commentary:* This clarifies the emptiness of difficulty and ease.
Because of this difficulty, that becomes ease;
Because of this ease, that becomes difficulty.
Just as the artisan finds wood easy but clay difficult,
While the potter finds clay easy but wood difficult.
Thus it is said: difficulty and ease arise together.
If one aligns with what is difficult, there is no ease;
If one aligns with what is easy, there is no difficulty—
Difficulty and ease are not real;
Names arise from delusion—this is emptiness.
Thus those who comprehend it
Forget skill and clumsiness alike,
And difficulty and ease cease in name—
Just as beauty and evil have no fixed nature.

*Commentary:* Difficulty arises from ease;
Without ease, one cannot know difficulty.
Ease arises from difficulty;
Without difficulty, one cannot manifest ease.
They cycle and rely upon each other,
Sequentially serving their function.
If examined and understood clearly,
One is unobstructed by difficulty,
Unattached to ease,
And thus can speak of *equating things*,
Unifying with the Middle Way.

*"Artisan"* refers to skilled craftsmanship;
*"Potter"* refers to shaping earth into vessels.
Each excels in their craft—thus it is easy,
But if forced to do the other—it becomes difficult.

Length and shortness define each other.
*Commentary:* This clarifies the emptiness of length and shortness.
Because of length, shortness is revealed;
Because of shortness, length is revealed.
Thus it is said: length and shortness define each other—
Just as the duck’s shank is not short,
Yet compared to the crane’s length, it seems deficient,
And the crane’s shank is not long,
Yet compared to the duck’s shortness, it seems excessive.
Seeing length and shortness define each other,
Like beauty and evil, they lack fixed substance—
All are delusive emotions.
Since their forms are empty, their names are also empty—
Thus they are indeterminate.

*Commentary:* Things have forms of length and shortness;
Matters arise with laws of difficulty and ease;
Transformations emerge with changes of *you* and *wu*—
All are natural.
If one is bound by vulgar perceptions,
Then length cannot but be long,
Shortness cannot but be short.
Difficulty, ease, *you*, and *wu* lie here.
To be obstructed by them is attachment;
To transcend them is the Dao.
Only those who follow the Dao can avoid obstruction.

The analogy of the duck and crane
Is also from *Zhuangzi*, *Overlapping Thumbs*—
Saying each has its proper measure,
And one cannot adjust the other to benefit or harm.
This condemns those who do not follow nature.

The high and low in mutual inclination—
*Commentary:* This illustrates that the names "high" and "low" are empty.
The names "high" and "low" mutually incline and usurp one another.
Thus, when one speaks of "high," it depends upon the "low," yet there is still one who is higher;
When one speaks of "low," it depends upon the "high," yet there is still one who is lower.
Moreover, if one is high, that which is called "high" is not truly high;
If one is low, that which is called "low" is not truly low.
Like the substitutions in the *Dàjiān*[代间],
All these named positions, as they alternate like servants and concubines,
Are also without constancy—
All this is because they are empty, hence without fixed rank.

*Commentary:* The establishment of high and low—
Names of form, posture, rank, innate wisdom, talent, and achievement—
Amidst myriad differences, all possess high and low,
Yet it is not merely confined to named ranks.
But if one forgets their highness and forgets their lowness,
Each abides in their proper measure,
Guarding the natural order,
Then there will be no mutual usurpation.

"Servant" is the humble designation for men;
"Concubine" is the humble designation for women.
They are submissive to others, hence called "servant" and "concubine."
*Commentary:* This elucidates the doctrine of ranks,
Expanding the warning to all common sentiments.
The Way of eminence and humility—
Each abides in their proper measure,
Without mutual usurpation,
Then they preserve their beginning and end.
If one abandons humility and covets exalted titles,
Or despises lowliness while scheming for high rank,
Not content with their original station,
Disaster will follow.
Thus the *Sutra* says:
*"Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace,
Knowing when to stop brings no peril—
Thus one endures forever.
How could one not be warned?"*

The harmony of sounds—
*Commentary:* This illustrates that harmony is empty.
When the five tones harmonize to form a melody,
Who unifies these myriad sounds to compose the measure?
As the *Dàjiān*’s methods are all harmonized,
Their essence is not true—
All this is empty.
Thus, to determine their beauty or ugliness,
How could it be the discourse of one who perceives thoroughly?

*Commentary:* Heaven and Earth exhale *qi*, and myriad sounds arise;
The *lǜ* and *lè* harmonize, and myriad melodies are born.
When sounds arise, beauty and ugliness follow,
Thus there are distinctions of tranquil joy, resentment, anger,
Sorrow, contemplation, and *xīn* and *xiàn*[惉懘].
Yet these distinctions arise from human affairs and follow them,
Governance and transformation respond accordingly.
To one who perceives thoroughly,
Good and evil are forgotten.
To follow changes while blaming reality is deluded emotion.
Forgetting beauty and ugliness alone is the Dao of thorough perception.
Those who attain the Dao of thorough perception,
Though vast as Heaven and Earth, though teeming as myriad things,
Hold nothing at all.

The *Yuelè Jì* says:
*"All sounds arise from the human heart;
The heart is moved by things and manifests in sound.
Sounds resonate, thus forming variations—
When variations form, they are called sound.
Comparing sounds to make music,
And using *gānqí*, *yǔmáo*—
This is called music.
Thus, when the sorrowful heart is moved,
Its sound is mournful and sharp;
When the joyful heart is moved,
Its sound is smooth and slow;
When the delighted heart is moved,
Its sound is bright and dispersed;
When the angry heart is moved,
Its sound is coarse and fierce;
When the reverent heart is moved,
Its sound is upright and austere;
When the loving heart is moved,
Its sound is harmonious and gentle.
Thus, the ancient kings were cautious in what moved them,
Hence they used *lǐ* to guide their intentions,
Music to harmonize their hearts,
Governance to unify their actions,
And law to prevent deceit.
*Lǐ*, music, law, and governance—
Their ultimate aim is one."*

The Dao of sound is aligned with governance.
*Gōng* is the sovereign,
*Shāng* is the minister,
*Jiǎo* is the people,
*Zhēng* is affairs,
*Yǔ* is things.
If these five are not disordered,
Then it is the sound of *xīn* and *xiàn*.
The music of a well-ordered world is tranquil and joyful—
Its governance is harmonious;
The music of a chaotic world is resentful and angry—
Its governance is discordant;
The music of a doomed state is sorrowful and contemplative—
Its people are suffering.
If *gōng* is disordered, it becomes wild—
Its sovereign grows arrogant;
If *shāng* is disordered, it becomes biased—
Its officials are corrupt;
If *jiǎo* is disordered, it becomes anxious—
Its people are resentful;
If *zhēng* is disordered, it becomes sorrowful—
Its affairs are laborious;
If *yǔ* is disordered, it becomes perilous—
Its wealth is depleted.
If all five are disordered, successively oppressing one another,
It is called *màn*.
The music of *Zhèng* and *Wèi* is the chaotic world’s sound,
Comparable to *màn*.
The music of *Sāngjiān* and *Púshàng* is the doomed state’s sound—
Its governance is scattered, its people dispersed.

Those who know sounds but not music are like beasts.
Those who know music but not the *Lè* are the common folk.
Only the noble knows *Lè*.
To discern sounds and know music,
To discern music and know *Lè*,
To discern *Lè* and know governance—
Those who do not know sounds cannot speak of music,
Those who do not know music cannot speak of *Lè*.
Those who know *Lè* are nearly aligned with *lǐ*.

Zǐ Xià replied to Wèi Wén Hóu:
*"The music of Zhèng seduces and indulges the mind,
The music of Sòng is leisurely and drowns the mind,
The music of Wèi is intricate and vexes the mind,
The music of Qí is arrogant and boasts.
These four harm virtue—
They are not proper music."*

In the *Chūnqiū*, Yàn Zǐ replied to Jǐng Gōng of Qí:
*"The ancient kings blended the five flavors
To harmonize the five tones,
To tranquilize the heart,
To perfect governance—
Music is like flavor.
First, *qì* must be stirred by *qì*—
Second, *tǐ* dances, emulating Wǔ and Wū—
Third, it follows the *fēng*, *yǎ*, and *sòng*—
Fourth, it uses the four directions’ things to make instruments.
The five tones are *gōng*, *shāng*, *jiǎo*, *zhēng*, and *yǔ*.
The six *lǜ* are: *Huángzhōng*, *Tàizhù*, *Gūxǐ*, *Ruìbīn*, *Yízé*, and *Wúshè*.
The six *lǘ* are: *Jiāzhōng*, *Línzhōng*, *Zhònglǘ*, *Yìngzhōng*, *Nánlǘ*, and *Dàlǘ*.
*Lǜ* governs the yang, *lǘ* governs the yin.
The seven tones were established by Wǔ Wáng when he subdued Jiè.
From *wǔ* to *zǐ*, seven days were set as the seven tones.
The eight winds are the winds of the eight directions:
East is *Míngshù*,
Southeast is *Qīngmíng*,
South is *Yǐngfēng*,
Southwest is *Liángfēng*,
West is *Yánhé*,
Northwest is *Bùzhōu*,
North is *Guǎnghàn*,
Northeast is *Róngfēng*.
The *Jiǔgē* are the songs of the six ministries and three affairs,
The nine functions in song.
Pure and impure, small and great,
Short and long, swift and slow,
Sorrowful and joyful, rigid and yielding,
Fast and slow, high and low—
Entering and exiting, dense and sparse—
They intermingle and assist one another."

The Noble One listens with equanimity to harmonize the heart.
When the heart is balanced and virtue is in accord, then one approaches the Dao.

Shun crafted the five-stringed *qín* to sing of the South Wind,
while Qí first instituted music to bestow upon the feudal lords the Way of governing the realm.
Through sound, one discerns order and chaos—
thus, the Prince of Wu, Zǐzhā, traversed and listened to the ancient and modern music of the Three Dynasties,
and thereby knew their rise and fall.

The cultivated scholar, closing the eyes and turning inward to listen to the unsounded,
may then speak of the Dao.

**On "Before and After":**
The six [principles] interpenetrate, sequentially establishing their names.
Just as beauty and ugliness do not arise from inherent nature,
but from false projections—
thus, these names exist.
**Commentary:** This clarifies the emptiness of the three times.
Day and night succeed one another;
the new arises from the passing.
Like lifting the foot—
which is before, which is after?
Thus, the distinction of "before and after" is a name given by their succession.
Names are arbitrarily established—
who can grasp their essence?

The past, future, and present—
the three empty times.
Thus, in constant transformation,
beauty and ugliness have no fixed names.

**Meaning:** The distinction of before and after arises from change.
Without change or movement,
who comes after, who comes first?
Once there is succession,
then before and after are divided.
The enlightened observer transcends them all.
Worldly laws emphasize their differences.
"Lifting the foot" means taking a step—
which comes first, which follows?
Those who understand this
cease the striving of before and after.

The Venerable Master, pitying the world’s drift and forgetfulness,
pointing to the Six Matters to awaken the confused.
The Middle Way is neither yin nor yang—
it has no partial name.
Standing between Heaven and Earth,
unbound and free,
resting where met,
without concern for merit or fame,
returning to the origin of the Dao.

Though the differences between Yáo and Jié,
the shifts of life and death,
the divisions of right and wrong,
the disparities of longevity and short life,
the separations of honor and disgrace,
the stirrings of sorrow and joy,
the succession of past and present—
all are forgotten.

Not knowing the difference between Yáo and Jié—
forgetting beauty and ugliness.
Not knowing the shifts of life and death—
forgetting existence and nonexistence.
Not knowing the divisions of right and wrong—
forgetting difficulty and ease.
Not knowing the disparities of longevity and short life—
forgetting long and short.
Not knowing the separations of honor and disgrace—
forgetting high and low.
Not knowing the stirrings of sorrow and joy—
forgetting sound and voice.
Not knowing the succession of past and present—
forgetting before and after.

Dwelling in the realm of "not this,"
standing on the path of "no haste,"
encountering without resistance,
passing without clinging—
responding in accordance with the Dao,
adding without excess,
subtracting without loss—
this is the one who comprehends the Middle Way,
forgetting distinctions of before and after,
forgetting the mechanisms of change.

Thus, the Sage acts in *wuwei* affairs,
practices speechless teaching.
**Note:** *Wuwei* affairs are no affairs.
The term is borrowed for naming, hence "acts in."
Speechless teaching is forgetting speech;
the term is borrowed for naming, hence "practices."

**Commentary:** "Thus" explains the following to clarify the preceding.
Though the cunningly clever may remain silent,
they are not *wuwei*.
Those who follow their natural state,
though they issue commands all day,
remain ever at ease.

Thus, the Sage, knowing the emptiness of all dharmas,
without arrogance or attachment,
governs the world by abandoning pretense,
employing pure virtue—
the people transform,
each content in their place,
contentment brings no disturbance—
is this not *wuwei*?

Words issuing from the Sage
all align with the hearts of the people—
thus, though they speak all their lives,
they never truly speak—
is this not speechless teaching?

**Meaning:** The Sage harmonizes with Heaven and Earth in virtue,
with the sun and moon in luminosity,
with the four seasons in order,
with spirits and gods in auspiciousness and calamity—
this is the Sage.

Briefly stated, there are five kinds:
1. The Sage who attains the Dao—
the Most High Venerable Lord and the Heavenly Great Sages.
2. The Sage who holds the Mandate of Heaven and attains immortality—
Fuxi, the Yellow Emperor, Zhuanxu, Shàohào, Yáo, and Shùn.
3. The Sage who holds the Mandate of Heaven but does not attain immortality—
Tang of Shang and Wén and Wǔ of the Zhou.
All cleared the Six Directions without speaking of ascending to Heaven.
4. The Sage of comprehensive excellence,
without the Mandate of Heaven—
Zhōugōng and Kǒngzǐ, who established rites and music,
setting examples for a hundred kings,
though lacking the Five-August position,
yet possessing the beauty of harmonizing with Heaven and Earth.
5. The Sage of singular excellence,
without comprehensive renown,
nor possessing the virtues above—
such as Bó Yá and Shī Wén as Sages of the *qín*,
Zǐqīng and Suīmíng as Sages of the *xiàng*,
Zhōngqí and Yánzhōu as Sages of harmony,
Hán Ér and Qín Qīng as Sages of song,
Gōng Shū and Wén Zhì as Sages of insight,
Lí Zhū and Shī Guāng as Sages of sight and hearing,
Zhāng Zhě and Zhōng Shī as Sages of calligraphy.

The Sages mentioned in the Classics
refer to those who govern the world.
The Sage who governs the world
merely sits in reverence, facing south—
what does this entail?
It is the practice of *wuwei* affairs,
observing the beauty of Heaven and Earth,
penetrating the principles of all things,
following the course of the four seasons—
the ruler does nothing above,
yet all things transform below—
this is the practice of speechless teaching.

Governance thus:
the people rest content in their dwellings,
delight in their customs,
and align with the Dao.

All things act without complaint.
**Note:** The Sage’s benevolent transformation
leaves the people unaware—
they wander and rejoice,
each moving naturally,
without complaint to the Sage.

**Commentary:** *Zuò* means movement.
*Ci* means complaint.
The Sage’s governance is effortless and without action;
the people, unaware, move freely,
each finding their natural motion,
without complaint to the Sage.

Thus, when the people strike the earth and pat their bellies while forgetting the Sovereign’s power,
this is how the people forget the Sage’s merit.

**Explanation (義):**
The Sage’s relation to all things:
All things have existed since antiquity—
why should they require the Sage’s creation before they exist?
They naturally attain their own birth, growth, and motion.

*"Yuan you yu yu"*—words from the *Tai Xuan Jing*.
It means that when the ruler above does nothing,
those below naturally thrive—
thus, they are at ease.

*"Strike the earth"*—*ruǎn* (壤) means soil.
The *Zhuangzi* ["Lost Chapter on the Horse’s Hoof"] says:
In the time of Hu Xi Shi,
the people carried food in their mouths and played,
drummed their bellies and wandered.
They knew nothing of the Sovereign’s power.

The Master Charged [Wang Chong] said in *Lunheng*:
When Yao ruled,
his governance was vast—
no one could name his deeds.
At fifty years old, a man struck the earth on the road,
drummed his belly and wandered,
singing:
*"Dig wells to drink,
plow fields to eat.
The sun rises, we work;
the sun sets, we rest.
What has the Sovereign’s power to do with me?"*
This is how the common people forget the Sage’s merit.

Born yet not possessed,
acting yet not relying,
merit accomplished yet not claimed.
**Note:**
Let all things fulfill their nature—
not taken as one’s own,
each attaining their own actions without dependence.
Thus, the Great Peace’s merit is achieved.

Yet one must still be cautious each day,
never daring to rest complacent.
**Commentary:**
Let all things fully realize their natural order—
the Sage does not claim them as his own.
Let all things fulfill their own endeavors—
the Sage does not rely on them as his merit.
Thus, the Great Peace’s merit spreads ever farther,
yet one must still remain as vigilant as at the beginning,
never daring to rest.

This is how the Sage forgets his own merit.
The note says *"each day cautious"*—words from the *Shujing*.

**Explanation:**
The Sage governs things without harming them;
things fulfill their own life.
Things fulfill their own life—
the Sage does not possess them yet relies on their merit,
trusting in Nature alone, abiding in perfect harmony.

Merit has many forms:
Royal merit is called *xūn* (勋)—
like the Duke of Zhou aiding the King.
State merit is called *gōng* (功)—
like Yi Yin preserving the state.
People’s merit is called *yōng* (庸)—
like Hou Ji teaching the people.
Labor merit is called *láo* (劳)—
like Yu the Great stabilizing the land.
Administrative merit is called *jì* (绩)—
like Jiu Xian establishing laws.
Martial merit is called *duō* (多)—
like Han Xin defeating enemies.
The primordial merit of creating all things is called *xuán gōng* (玄功)—
its depth and reach are profound.

Merit accomplished yet not claimed—
thus preserving the merit of *wuwei*.

Each day cautious, each day explained—
the Sage’s transformative merit is not self-praised or relied upon,
only fearing loss, lest his merit fail.
Thus, he grows ever more vigilant,
never daring to rest.
*Ning* (宁) means ease.
*Shèn* (慎) means caution.

The Sage’s *wuwei* yields vast merit—
things fulfill their nature without losing their proper place.
Heaven is clear above,
Earth is tranquil below,
the Four Seas unified in peace—
serene and at ease—
this is called Great Peace.

Only by not claiming merit does it not depart.
**Note:**
Only by not daring to rest complacent and ever refining virtue
does the Sage forget his merit while it remains—
thus, not claiming it yet it does not vanish.

**Commentary:**
The Sage’s sincerity is as straight as hair,
vigilant to the end as at the start,
neither beginning nor end decaying,
never resting in ease or indulgence.
Thus, each day renewing his great virtue,
forgetting merit while it does not depart,
his light abiding as the world finds peace.

Hence it is said:
Only by not claiming does it not depart.

**Explanation:**
*Fu wei* (夫唯)—opening words of the passage.
It speaks of the Sage above not possessing or claiming.
The Sage’s influence extends to the Four Quarters yet he does not claim it,
his benevolence covers all things yet he does not call it favor,
his merit benefits the world yet he does not take it as his own,
his virtue surpasses the Four Seas yet he does not rule as master.
He forgets himself in the Dao,
harmonizes his will with the Void,
governing above yet the people do not burden him,
leading before yet the people do not harm him—
the world delights in promoting him without exhaustion.

Thus, his virtue does not depart.

The King does not err in joy or anger—
then punishments and rewards are not excessive,
and arms do not rise.
He does not err in seeking or taking—
then taxes and levies are not heavy,
and provisions are not excessive.
He does not err in love or hatred—
then appointments and dismissals are just,
and the worthy and unworthy are distinguished.
He does not err in favoring attendants—
then those before and behind are all upright.
He does not err in claiming land—
then arms do not march,
and soldiers do not toil.
He does not err in governing the people—
then the world is at peace.

Things attain their proper place,
not relying on his merit—
*wuwei* without reliance yields its benefits.

Truly vast and profound!
*"Straight as hair"*—words from the *Shijing* ["Small Odes: The People of the Capital"].
It speaks of emotions sincere and conduct upright,
like hair’s roots and ends unbroken.

**Chapter Three: Not Exalting the Virtuous**

**Explication:**
The previous chapter illuminated how myriad distinctions return to their root through benevolent transformation. This chapter clarifies that the Sage’s nobility lies not in outward display, but in *wuwei*—thus attaining the fundamental truth. It begins by rejecting the traces of arrogance and flattery, proceeds to demonstrate the Sage’s method of teaching through natural principle, and concludes with *wuwei*, showing how cultivation returns to simplicity once harmony is achieved.

**Meaning:**
The Sage establishes the Way; the virtuous assist it. Fish and water depend on each other—how could one do without the other? From the sovereigns of the Three Dynasties to the kings who conquered, those who founded states and achieved great deeds relied on the virtuous as their foundation. To "not exalt" means to reject the conduct of pride and flattery.

When the virtuous are employed, the people govern themselves; when flattery is employed, disputes arise. By not exalting pride and display, there are no disputes. By not valuing ornate appearance or precious goods, the people have no greed. This aligns with the Sage’s ideal: a heart empty of vanity, a belly full of sincerity—*wuwei* without knowledge or desire.

To not exalt the virtuous is to prevent the people from striving. **Annotation:** Exalting the virtuous leaves traces; following those traces breeds contention. If the virtuous and the unvirtuous each fulfill their proper roles, there will be no contention.

**Explication:**
*Shang* means to elevate and honor. *Xian* refers to talent and ability. When a ruler elevates and honors talent, traces of flattery emerge. Following those traces distorts truth, and distorting truth inevitably stems from exalting the virtuous. Flattery gives rise to the vice of contention.

Better than this is the Sage’s mysterious transformation—letting *wuwei* take its course, so that clouds naturally follow the dragon and winds always follow the tiger. Then, in the reigns of Tang and Yu, there will be no shortage of ministers like Yuan Kai; Yi Yin and Lu Jia will rise in court, fulfilling the hopes of the state. Each in their proper place, none coveting what is not theirs—thus, no contention arises.

**Translation:**

**Explication:**
*"Xún jì"* refers to the act of feigning and deceit. Once the principle of honoring the virtuous is established, those who feign and deceive will inevitably arise. Why is this so? The virtuous are difficult to discern—crafty words breed doubt, flattery obscures loyalty. How easily can one distinguish truth?

The Classics say: *"Wisdom’s emergence brings great deceit."* Thus, when the ruler favors wisdom, the people respond with deceit; when the ruler favors the virtuous, the people respond with falsehood.

Better than this is to rectify one’s own conduct and lead by example, employing *wuwei* to govern the people, nurturing them with the Great Harmony, and transforming them through purity and stillness. Then, those who assist in governance will naturally be the virtuous, and they will serve their purpose.

This is what is meant by *"the dragon’s clouds and the tiger’s winds."* When clouds follow the dragon and winds follow the tiger, it is as the *Yijing* explains in the *Qian* hexagram: the *"Flying Dragon in Heaven"* (九五) broadens its influence over all things, so water flows to dampness, fire seeks dryness, clouds follow the dragon, and winds follow the tiger—each responding to its kind by natural affinity.

This illustrates the Sovereign ascending to the *"Flying Dragon"* position, where all underheavens gather like clouds. When the Sage appears, all things behold him. Those rooted in Heaven draw near above, those rooted in Earth draw near below. This speaks of water as yin—when it flows to Earth, it seeks dampness—and fire as yang—when it burns in kindling, it seeks dryness. Though these two lack awareness or sentiment, they are drawn together by *qi* alone. Yet even more so, the dragon—a water creature—and clouds—water’s *qi*—when the dragon roars, mist arises. The tiger, a fierce beast, and wind, a vibrating force—when the tiger howls, valley winds stir. These two possess awareness and sentiment, yet because their *qi* and kindred nature align with the insensate, they too respond in kind.

How much more so when the Sage descends into the world, the *"Flying Dragon in Heaven"*! The virtuous and wise mutually reinforce each other, and all things resonate in harmony. Thus, the Sage’s deeds are broadly proclaimed.

**The Reign of Tang and Yu:**
Emperor Yao, surnamed *Tao Tang*, of the *Yiqi* clan, named *Fangxun*, was the son of Emperor *Yu*. His mother, *Qingdu*, was the secondary consort of Emperor *Yu*, who conceived after being visited by a red dragon. She bore Yao at fourteen months.

From youth, Yao possessed sage virtue. At sixteen, he ascended as the Duke of Tang. He ruled for seventy years from *Jì*, dying at eighty-six. Knowing his son, *Dan Zhu*, was unworthy, he openly sought talent and ultimately selected *Shun*, testing him for two years before betrothing him to his two daughters to observe his virtue. After two years, Yao abdicated in favor of Shun.

Shun ruled for twenty-eight years before Yao’s death. Yao lived to 117, buried at *Jìyīn Chéngyáng*. The posthumous title reads: *"Yao"*—*"the one who proclaims virtue and transmits the Dao."*

Emperor Shun of the *Yú* clan descended from *Zhuānxū*, grandson of *Qiōngniú*, son of *Gǔsōu*. His mother, *Wòdēng*, conceived after seeing a great rainbow. Shun was born at *Yáoqiū*, hence his clan name *Yáo*, given name *Zhònghuá*. Renowned for filial piety, he was tested and ruled for two years before ascending the throne. After Yao’s death at twenty-eight years of reign, Shun was thirty when appointed, tested for two years, and ruled as regent for twenty-eight years before a three-year mourning period. He reigned as Sovereign for fifty years, died in *Cāngwú* while inspecting the southern lands, and lived to 112. He commanded *Yǔ* to succeed him and was buried at *Jiǔyí’s Línglíng*. Since his son, *Shāngjūn*, was unworthy, Shun did not transmit the throne to him.

After Shun’s ascent to *Cāngwú* and his refusal to return, his two consorts gazed after him. The nine peaks of *Jiǔyí* all resembled one another, and they could not determine where he had gone. Each peak became a subject of doubt, and their tears stained the bamboo, hence its name, *Jiǔyí*. The *Shū* says: *"Shun ascended the heights and died."* The *Shǐ* says: *"Shun mounted the distant."* This speaks of his ascent to a lofty, unreachable place. The *Dao Learning Transmission* says: *"Yao became the True Lord of *Tàiwéi*, Shun the True Lord of *Tàijí*."* The *Record of Jiǔyí Mountain* says: *"Shun descended into the mountain."* This confirms their exalted station as true sages, their virtue surpassing mortals—thus, they attained the Dao, ascended to immortality, and became divine.

In antiquity, *Yúfú* played at *Zhānshān*, soaring aloft. The *Wàngdì* resided at *Shíniǔ*, swiftly ascending. The *Xuānhuáng* ascended the dragon at *Dǐnghú*, and *Xià Yǔ* rode the breeze at *Jìngshuǐ*. The *Zhuāngzi* [*Great Master*] says: *"The *Píwéi* clan obtained it to lift Heaven and Earth; the *Fúxī* clan obtained it to inherit the *Qi* Mother; the Yellow Emperor obtained it to ascend to the Cloud Sky; *Zhuānxū* obtained it to dwell in the *Xuángōng*; thus, *Shénnóng* oversaw the South Pole, *Yīntāng* governed the North Mysterious, *Wǔdīng* held the Purple Bureau, *Yángjiǎ* held the Azure Origin, *Wénwáng* held the Great Void, *Wǔwáng* held the Great Peace, *Kāngwáng* held the Lesser Summit, *Mùwáng* held the Nine Mysterious, *Hàn Jǐng* held the Great One, *Hàn Wén* held the Perfected Mysterious, the Eight Emperors held the Eight Stars, and *Hàn Wǔ* held the Mysterious Completion. These were all rulers who governed the realm, attained the True, and ascended to their divine stations."*

Thus, Yao and Shun’s ascension to immortality was indeed fitting.

**The Ministers Like Yuan Kai:**
These were the *Bāyuàn Bākǎi*. In the time of *Gāoxīn*, there were eight talented sons: *Bófèn, Zhòngkǎn, Shùxiàn, Jìzhòng, Bǎohǔ, Zhòngxióng, Shūbào, Jìlí*. They were loyal, reverent, respectful, and beautiful in virtue, kind and harmonious in benevolence—thus, the people called them the *Bāyuàn*. *"Yuàn"* means *"reverent,"* and *"yì"* means *"beautiful."*

---
*(Note: Some minor gaps in the original text, such as the missing character in *Zhuāngzi*, were inferred from context.)*

The **Eight De** were thus named:
*"Xuān"* means *"pervasive,"* and *"yuàn"* means *"virtuous."* The **Gāoyáng** clan had eight talented sons: **Cāngshū, Tuígǔ, Dǎojí, Dàlín, Lóngjiàng, Tíngjiān, Zhòngróng, and Shūdá**. They were harmonious with the Sage, broad and profound in wisdom, sincere and trustworthy in virtue—thus the people called them the **Eight Kai**.

*"Qí"* means *"central,"* *"yuān"* means *"deep,"* *"yǔn"* means *"trustworthy,"* *"dǔ"* means *"thick,"* and *"kǎi"* means *"harmonious."* These sixteen clans perpetuated their excellence, never losing their renown.

Emperor **Yáo** did not trust them, yet he appointed **Shùn** as his minister and dispatched the **Eight Yuàn** to propagate the **Five Teachings** across the lands. The **Five Teachings** were:
- **Father’s righteousness (fǔ yì),**
- **Mother’s kindness (mǔ cí),**
- **Elder brother’s friendship (xiōng yǒu),**
- **Younger brother’s reverence (dì gōng),**
- **Child’s filial piety (zǐ xiào).**

Within, harmony was achieved; without, success was realized.

The descendants of **Gāoxīn**, the **Eight Yuàn**, were the lineage of **Jì Qì**—those of the **Jú, Xì, Xióng, and Pí** clans. The **Eight Kai** were entrusted to govern the **Earthly Sovereign**, overseeing all affairs in due order. Thus, the land was leveled, and the heavens were perfected.

The title **Gāoyáng Zhūnxū** belonged to the descendants of the **Eight Kai**. When **Rú, Yǔ, Jiùxiào, and Yì** arose—among whom **Jiùxiào** was **Tíngjiān**—**Gāo** served as **Sītú**, broadening the **Five Teachings**, and thus was counted among the **Eight Yuàn**. **Yǔ** became **Sīkōng**, leveling the waters and lands, succeeding the **Earthly Sovereign’s** office, and thus was counted among the **Eight Kai**.

*"Nèi píng"* meant harmonizing the **Zhōushà** (central states), while *"wài chéng"* meant subduing the **Róng-Dí** (barbarians). **Shùn** appointed the sixteen clans, and the realm was ordered. Both within and without, peace prevailed—this was referenced in the *Spring and Autumn Annals* when **Jǔ Pú** assassinated his lord and fled to **Lǔ**, and **Jì Sūn Xíngfǔ** cited this event to admonish **Lǔ Xuān Gōng**.

**Yī Lǚ**—that is, **Yī Yǐn**, born in the hollow of **Kōngsāng** beside the **Yī River**, who aided **Yīn** as prime minister, assisting **Tàijié** as **Āhéng**. His ancestor, **Yī Zhí**, had helped **Tāng** establish the state, achieving great peace. **Yī Yǐn’s** son, **Yī Lù**, served **Tàijié’s** grandson, **Tàiwù**. The deeds of these three ministers were recorded in the **Yīn dynasty**.

**Lǚ** refers to **Tàigōng Wàng**—surname **Jiāng**, given name **Zǐyá**, who fished in **Pánxī**, split a great fish, and found a **jade huáng** within, its center containing a **war bell**. **Zǐyá** mastered it, and by eighty years of age, **Zhōu Wén Wáng**, when divining a hunt along the **Wèi River**, received the omen: *"Not a bear, not a tiger—only the teacher of a king."* He captured **Zǐyá**, took him home, and later, with military strategy, aided **Wǔ Wáng** in conquering **Yīn**, founding the **Zhōu dynasty**.

Initially, he was enfeoffed at **Lǚ**, or sometimes at **Fǔ**. Thus, in the *Book of Documents*, during **Mù Wáng’s** reign, there was a **Lǚ Hóu**, or sometimes a **Fǔ Hóu**, his descendant.

After **Tàigōng** defeated **Zhòu**, he was enfeoffed in **Qí**, and the **Kāng Gōng** summoned him, saying: *"Five marquises, nine hegemonies—you shall truly lead them, aiding the **Zhōu court**."* He was granted territory from the **East Sea** to the **Hé River**, from **Mùlíng** in the south to **Wúdì** in the north. Later, **Huán Gōng Xiǎobái** became the hegemon among the feudal lords. By the end of the **Spring and Autumn**, his minister **Tián Hé** deposed **Qí Kāng Gōng** and exiled him to the sea, seizing his state.

**Tāihéng’s** grandeur was that the **Son of Heaven** established the **Three Ministers’** offices to symbolize the **Three Altars**. The **Three Altars and Six Palaces** were the **Tàiyuè, Sītú, Sīkōng, Tàishī, Tàizuàn, and Tàibǎo**. The **Three Altars and Six Stars**—each of the **Upper, Middle, and Lower Altars** had two stars—lay south of **Zǐwēi**, guarding the **Emperor’s** seat, rising from **Wénchāng** to **Tàiwēi**. The **Celestial Stairs** governed the **Three Ministers, Nine Ministers, and commoners**, and the **Nine Regions’** colors and ranks aligned—then the **sovereign and ministers** were harmonious, and the laws were just.

From the **Upper Altar** to the **Middle Altar** was sixteen degrees; from the **Middle Altar** to the **Lower Altar**, also sixteen degrees. The stars were half a degree apart—too dispersed was extravagance, too narrow was oppression. The **upper star** represented the **Son of Heaven**, the **middle star** the **marquises, dukes, and earls**, and the **lower star** the **ministers and great officials**. If they were **small and clear**, it was auspicious; if they **shaken or changed color**, it was ominous. If one star vanished, the realm was in peril. If two stars vanished, the realm was in chaos. If three stars vanished, the realm was beyond governance.

The **Tàishī** was the **master of rites**, setting the model for all under heaven. The **Tàizuàn** taught with **virtue and righteousness**, the **Tàibǎo** protected the **sovereign’s** person, the **Tàiyuè** commanded the military, the **Sītú** reverently promulgated the **Five Teachings**, and the **Sīkōng** governed the leveling of waters and lands. These three ministers corresponded to the **Three Altars above**.

**Āhéng**—*"Ā"* meant *"lean upon,"* and *"héng"* meant *"balance."* The **Son of Heaven** leaned on the **Three Ministers** to govern the realm justly. The *Book of Documents* states that **Yī Yǐn** aided **Yīn** as **Āhéng**.

**Qíyú** meant *"aspiration."* One should not value **difficult-to-obtain treasures**, lest the people become thieves. **Difficult-to-obtain treasures** were those beyond one’s natural endowment. To seek the unattainable is why they are called **difficult-to-obtain**. If one does not rest in their natural portion, aspiring to what they lack, they lose their inherent nature—how is this not theft?

To let things fulfill their nature and affairs accord with their capacities, then **difficult-to-obtain treasures** will not be prized, and the **essence of life** will not be stolen.

**Commentary:** A person’s birth is endowed with a portion—what they inherit is their **body and treasures**. To covet beyond one’s portion, seeking the unattainable, is why they are called **difficult-to-obtain**. If one does not rest in their natural endowment, aspiring to cleverness, they lose their **true nature**, becoming entirely private thieves.

Now, if the **wise and foolish** follow their nature, and the **able and incapable** act according to their capacities, with no exceeding of bounds, they will naturally disregard **difficult-to-obtain treasures**. All will attain their natural portion—who would be a thief?

Thus, **Zhuāngzi** said: *"The unvirtuous person severs the **essence of life**, gluttonously coveting wealth and rank."*

**Further Explanation:** If the **sovereign** does not prize **jade, rhinoceros horn, or treasures**, his governance will be **clear and tranquil**. The people will follow his example, naturally abandoning greed. Each will know contentment, and thus, none will be thieves.

**Doctrine:** When a person is born, they inherit the **refined essence of Heaven and Earth**, obtaining **clear, pure, and luminous qi** to become **Sages or Worthies**, or **muddled, turbid qi** to become **foolish or lowly**.

The **Sages and Worthies** possess boundless wisdom and clarity, while the foolish and ignorant are shrouded in dimness and confusion. This arises from the inherent differences in one’s **nature and portion**.

**Laozi** told **Confucius**: *"The **Dao/Way** generates all people and myriad creatures—birds, beasts, insects—each with their unique pairings, for their **qi** differs. Yet common folk know not their true nature, only those who grasp **Dao/Way and virtue/power** can trace it to its source."*

**Wénzǐ** said: *"Clear **qi** is Heaven, turbid **qi** is Earth, harmonious **qi** is humanity. Within this harmonious **qi**, there is brightness and darkness, thus there are the **Worthy** and the foolish. The foolish covet the **Worthy’s** brilliance, thus they exceed their portion. The dim covet to replace the bright, thus they indulge in vain desires. This is what is called severing the **essence of life** and gluttonously craving wealth and rank—words from *Zhuāngzi’s* **‘Overgrown Thumbs’** chapter.*

Wealth and rank may be craved, yet still there are those who hold them in esteem. But if there is nothing to admire, people will content themselves with their portion, accepting tasks according to their capacity. Who would dare to sever their own nature and imitate others, gluttonously seizing what is beyond their due?

When the **sovereign** does not prize jade, rhinoceros horn, or treasures, the people below cease their greed. Each finds contentment—this is what it means to be without theft. When there is nothing desirable to be seen, the heart remains undisturbed.

**Explanation:** Without aspiring to **Worthy** status or seeking rare treasures, there is nothing visible to desire, and thus the heart does not stray.

**Commentary:** Coveting brilliance is seeing what is desirable. When desire stirs, what else is it but confusion? Now, if one neither extols the **Worthy** nor seeks beyond their portion, then there is nothing desirable to be seen, and the heart remains undisturbed.

**Explanation:** Coveting is the same as longing. With limited **nature and insight**, yet longing for brilliance, this is exceeding one’s portion—this is called **desire**.

Moreover, those who cultivate the **Dao/Way** in their early stages, though their practice is incomplete and their refinement unripe, fear what is desirable and are drawn by external influences. Thus, they retreat to mountains and forests to avoid the clamor of the world. But when their mind is tranquil and their resolve steadfast, external influences cannot seduce them. Throughout the day, they move with ease, never troubled.

This is what is meant by *"small concealment in the mountains, great concealment in the world."* Unable to sever **desire** entirely, they still fear being drawn by external influences, so they remain hidden in the mountains and forests to avoid what they see. Yet when their heart is serene, their thoughts still, and their true essence untainted—when external distractions cannot disturb them and their inner harmony remains unshaken—even amidst the bustling markets and the pursuit of fame and gain, these matters hold no sway over their heart; amidst the world’s chaos and disputes, right and wrong do not sway their intentions. Merged into the city’s throng, how could this hinder their pursuit of **True Essence**?

Thus, the **Sage’s** governance—**Commentary:** Teaching the **Dao/Way** of governing the self and the realm as its foundation—what else is there to governing the realm but governing the self? Therefore, with a **vacant heart and full belly**, severing **desire** and forgetting knowledge in **non-action**, there is nothing that cannot be governed.

**Explanation:** The **Yellow Emperor** said to **Shénzhen Rén**: *"I have never heard of a case where the self was not governed yet the realm was."* The human body is a microcosm of the realm. The chest and abdomen are like palaces and halls. The limbs are like borders and territories. The bones and joints are like officials. The **spirit** is like the sovereign. The blood is like ministers. The **qi** is like the people. To govern the self is to govern the realm. Loving the people secures the realm. Hoarding **qi** preserves the body. When the people scatter, the realm perishes. When **qi** is exhausted, life ends. The dead cannot be revived, the lost cannot be restored. Thus, the **Perfect Ones** eliminate afflictions before they arise and address illnesses before they manifest. **Qi** is difficult to nurture yet easy to corrupt; the people are difficult to gather yet easy to disperse. Govern before there is chaos; do not wait until it has passed.

**Assisting this principle:** Vacate the heart—**Note:** When the heart is not disturbed by what is desirable, it is vacant. **Commentary:** When the mind is enslaved to external influences, worldly affairs obscure it; when thoughts are still and **True Essence** is preserved, **desire** does not arise. When **desire** does not arise, the heart is vacant. **Zhuāngzi** said: *"A vacant chamber births purity."* This means that when the heart is vacant, pristine whiteness naturally emerges. Thus, it is said: *Vacate the heart.*

**Explanation:** Only the **Dao/Way** gathers in the vacant. When the heart is vacant, the **Dao/Way** gathers within. When the **Dao/Way** gathers within, the **spirit** plays with transformation, the heart communicates with Heaven, and all things beneath naturally transform, while the **Sage** remains serene above. This is the ultimate principle.

*"A vacant chamber births purity"*—words from *Zhuāngzi’s* **‘Between Heaven and Earth’** chapter. The chamber refers to the heart. To see yet not see is to vacate the heart. When the heart is vacant, pristine whiteness naturally emerges. Pristine whiteness is the appearance of boundless clarity.

The *Inner Observation Scripture* says: *"The heart is neither green nor red, neither white nor yellow, neither long nor short, neither round nor square. It encompasses Heaven and Earth, yet enters the finest hairs. Restrain it, and it stops; release it, and it rages. When pure, it lives; when turbid, it perishes. It illuminates the eight extremes, yet can be darkened in a single region. Of all things, the heart is the hardest to subdue. Therefore, teaching people to cultivate the **Dao/Way** is to teach them to cultivate the heart. Teaching them to cultivate the heart is to teach them the **Dao/Way**. The heart cannot be stilled by mere thought; the **Dao/Way** stills it. The heart is invisible; the **Dao/Way** reveals it. Good and evil, all worldly affairs—these arise from the heart and perish in the heart. Those who practice the **Dao/Way** extinguish the heart to align with it. Those of the world indulge the heart and endanger themselves. When the heart arises, there is chaos; when it is extinguished, there is order.

Thus, the **Son of Heaven** establishes officials, clarifies laws, institutes punishments and rewards, and hangs omens of fortune and misfortune to guide the people—all because the heart is difficult to govern. Without the heart, there are no commands. When the heart is steadfast, commands are not doubted. When the heart is stilled, commands are not acted upon. When the heart is restrained, commands are not chaotic. When the heart is rectified, commands are not perverse."*

「The purified heart ensures commands remain unstained.
The empty heart ensures commands do not cling.

Understanding these seven principles,
one may speak of the **Dao/Way**,
one may speak of cultivating the heart.

**Fill the belly**—
*When virtue/power fills within, there is no arrogance or flattery;
it is like satiety, halting desire and extinguishing greed.*

*Explanation:* The belly signifies capacity and sufficiency, thus not coveting.
To ensure virtue/power fills within and greed does not arise,
it is said: **fill the belly**.
The note "satiety halts desire" comes from the *Spring and Autumn Annals*’ account,
where **Yán Mò and Rú Kuān** admonished **Jìn Wǔzǐ**—
using the commoner’s belly as a metaphor for the noble’s heart:
when sated, there is enough, and no greed remains.

*Meaning:* The heart’s desires are boundless,
but the belly’s capacity is finite.
Thus, the heart must be emptied,
and the belly filled.
An empty heart prevents all cravings,
a filled belly halts acquisitiveness.
Nurturing loyalty and sincerity,
embracing simplicity—
this is virtue/power made complete within.

*The *Spring and Autumn Annals* is the name for the chronicles of Lǔ.
It records events by day, days by month, months by season, seasons by year.
Since the year has four seasons, it is named thus.

The **Son of Heaven** has imperial historians,
the feudal lords have state historians—
Chǔ called theirs *Táo Wú*,
Jìn called theirs *Chéng*,
Lǔ called theirs *Spring and Autumn*.
Confucius compiled the *Classic*,
Zuǒ Qiū Míng wrote the *Transmission*,
beginning in the 48th year of King Píng of Zhōu,
the 1st year of Duke Hùn of Lǔ,
when the Celestial Stem was *Dīng*,
the Heavenly Branch *Yǒu*,
the Year Star in *Jiàngliú*,
corresponding to the 2nd year of Jìn’s Duke Cuò,
the 13th year of Wèi’s Duke Huán Wán,
the 28th year of Cái’s Duke Xuān Kǎofǔ,
the 22nd year of Zhèng’s Duke Zhuāng Wèishēng,
the 35th year of Cáo’s Duke Huán Zhōngshēng,
the 9th year of Qí’s Duke Xī Lùfǔ,
the 19th year of Chǔ’s King Wǔ Dá,
the 44th year of Qín’s Duke Wén,
the 7th year of Sòng’s Duke Mù Hé,
the 23rd year of Chén’s Duke Huán Bào,
and the 18th year of Yān’s Duke Mù—
this marks the *Spring and Autumn*’s first year.

Until the 14th year of Duke Āi of Lǔ,
the 39th year of King Jìng of Zhōu,
when the Celestial Stem was *Wù*,
the Heavenly Branch *Wǔ*,
spanning 242 years in total.
It encompassed 14 kings of Zhōu,
12 dukes of Lǔ,
and recorded events concurrent with:
Jìn’s Duke Dìng Wǔ’s 31st year,
Wèi’s Duke Chù’s 12th year,
Cái’s Duke Chéng Yí’s 10th year,
Zhèng’s Duke Shēng Shèng’s 20th year,
Qí’s Duke Jiǎn Jiā’s 4th year,
Chǔ’s King Huì Zhāng’s 8th year,
Qín’s Duke Dào’s 11th year,
Sòng’s Duke Jǐng Tóuman’s 36th year,
Chén’s Duke Mǐn Yuè’s 21st year,
Yān’s Duke Jìng’s 6th year,
and Wú’s Fú Chà’s 15th year—
this is the year the *Spring and Autumn* ended with the "Deer in the Park" entry.

The text comprises 30 scrolls,

commented by Dù Yǔ, *Zhèngnán Jiāngjūn* of Jìn, styled *Yuán Kǎi*.

**Yán Mò and Rú Kuān’s admonition** appears in the 28th year of Duke Zhāo of Lǔ:
Jìn’s Wèi Xiànzǐ Shū governed, appointing his son Wù as *Dàfū* of Gěngyáng—now Jìnyáng.
In winter, a case arose in Gěngyáng that the magistrate could not judge,
so he reported it to Xiànzǐ.
The plaintiff’s ancestor, Tàizōng, had been given a concubine as tribute,
and Wèi Zǐ was about to accept it.
Wù said to Wèi Zǐ and the two ministers Yán Mò and Rú Kuān:
*"Our lord is renowned among the feudal lords for refusing bribes.
If he accepts Gěngyáng’s tribute, his greed will be unmatched.
My lord must surely advise against it."*
Both agreed to do so.»

After the court session, he waited in the hall. The tribute arrived,
and Wèi Zǐ summoned the two ministers to dine.
He set the dishes before them in order,
and sighed three times.

After the meal, he had them sit.
Wèi Zǐ said: *"I have heard from my elder brothers and uncles
that the common saying is: ‘Only in eating does one forget sorrow.
My lord sighed three times during the meal—why?"*

They replied in unison: *"When others grant us two small cups of wine,
we do not eat at night.
When the tribute first arrived,
I feared it might not be enough,
so I sighed once.
When it was placed in the middle,
I reproached myself: ‘Could it be that the General’s meal
is not sufficient?’
So I sighed a second time.
When the tribute was fully presented,
I wished to let my humble stomach serve as the virtuous heart’s measure,
and I stopped only when sated.
Thus, I sighed three times."*

Wèi Zǐ declined the tribute from Gěngyáng.
*Sprinkle* is a posthumous honor.
The *Zhū* states that *Wŭ Zǐ* was his name,
and *Wŭ* was his posthumous honor.

Yán Mò and Rú Kuān, the two ministers,
advised *Wŭ Zǐ* against accepting the tribute,
wishing to let their humble stomachs serve as the virtuous heart’s measure.
The stomach is easily filled,
but the heart is hard to satisfy.
They sought to curb his greed,
and thus he did not accept the bribe from Gěngyáng.
Even when small men’s bellies are full,
they still know to stop eating—
how much more should the virtuous heart do so!
The *Spring and Autumn Annals* praised this.

The Wèi clan accepted the advice,
and thus flourished.

Weaken his resolve:
*Annotation*: A hollow heart weakens resolve.
*The Zhū* states: Resolve is the heart’s matter;
when the heart is full of virtue and power,
it is called resolve.
He wished to let the heart act properly,
and all guarded against arrogance and haste,
so it was known that a hollow heart weakens resolve.

*Explanation*: As the *Shī Xù* says: *"What arises in the heart is resolve."*
What the heart resolves upon is matter;
what the heart acts upon is resolve.
When the heart is gentle and weak,
it has no reckless, hasty, or contentious matters,
and all things are in harmony.
When matters are in harmony,
they become the foundation of governance.

Strengthen his bones:
*Annotation*: A filled stomach strengthens the bones.
*The Zhū* states: Bones are the body’s framework;
when his virtue and power are internally complete,
he never takes greedily,
and without greed, his stomach is filled,
and a filled stomach strengthens his bones.

*Explanation*: To weaken resolve means to maintain purity and gentleness,
so as not to offend from without.
To strengthen bones means to be firm and prepared within.
Those who practice the Dao/Way have strong sinews and bones,
and a hundred diseases cannot invade them.
A filled stomach strengthens the bones—
the harmonious *qi* is abundant.
To govern the realm,
when the administration is clear, the people are tranquil;
when expenses are frugal, their strength is plentiful.
Tranquil people are those whose resolve is weakened;
plentiful strength is those whose bones are strengthened.
He always kept the people without knowledge of competition
and without desire for greed.

「The *Commentary* states: The Sage’s teaching of maintaining an empty heart and a full stomach is always meant to make the people lack the knowledge of competition and the desire for greed, so that they may transform themselves naturally.

*The Explanation* says: If there is desire for greed, competition will arise; if there is knowledge of competition, undertakings will flourish. When competition and desire are absent, purity and tranquility naturally manifest. Thus, the wise will not dare to act.

*The Commentary* further elaborates: Those without knowledge or desire have already attained purity and tranquility. Then, those with knowledge should gradually be cultivated and refined until they too do not dare to act, following the natural path of greed without transgression.

*The Explanation* says: When the lower aligns with the higher, it is like the wind bending the grass—simple and harmonious, universally reaching, and all return to inaction.

To act without action is to govern without fail. *Commentary*: When one acts in accordance with nature, even action becomes inaction.

Moreover, to abandon the pursuit of the rare and virtuous and not seek difficult-to-obtain wealth: people will naturally fulfill their roles, and all things will remain in their true state. In acting without action, what further pride or partiality remains?

When there is no sound or scent, people will not recognize nor comprehend, yet simple and harmonious winds will prevail—who can say governance is not achieved?

*The Explanation* says: The principle of non-action is profound indeed. Non-action does not mean refusing what is offered, rejecting what is given, or being unresponsive to pressure, emotion, or constraint. It means that private desires do not intrude upon public conduct, and personal inclinations do not distort proper methods. To act in accordance with principle, to establish merit based on resources, to complete tasks without self-praise, and to achieve deeds without claiming renown—this is non-action.

If one uses a boat for water, a sieve for sand, a cart for mud, and a plow for mountains, if one cultivates fields in summer and ponds in winter, relying on elevation for farming and depression for water storage, then this is not what we call "action"—it is non-action.

The Sage’s non-action is to follow naturally, to accomplish without exertion, to plan without error, to act without omission, to speak through refined language, to act through proper forms, to advance and retreat with the times, to move and rest in accordance with principle. He neither favors beauty nor despises ugliness, nor does he delight in rewards or resent punishments. Names are assigned by fate, and each type is utilized as it should. Matters arise naturally, never forced by his own will. He follows the Dao/Way’s timing, adapts to the land’s nature, and aligns with the people’s hearts. Thus, ministers gather like rays to the sun, and the virtuous and unvirtuous alike fulfill their roles.

The ruler gains the means to govern his ministers, and the ministers gain the means to serve their ruler. This is the Dao/Way of governing without action.

The passage "without sound or scent" refers to the *Shijing* [□] *Dàyá* [□] *Wénwáng* [□] Chapter, which speaks of the great Dao/Way being difficult to know. The ears do not hear its sounds, the nose does not perceive its fragrance, yet if one follows the conduct of King Wen, the world will naturally trust and submit.

The passage "not recognized, not comprehended" refers to the *Shijing* [□] *Dàyá* [□] *Huángyǐ* [□] Chapter, which states that people do not recognize the past nor know the present, yet those who follow the Dao/Way’s laws will align with this. This passage accords with the teaching that the Dao/Way values sincerity and naturalness, not the pursuit of the virtuous or wealth.

**Chapter Four: The Dao/Way of Non-Action and Its Application**
*The Commentary* states: The previous chapter clarified that noble pursuits are not actively promoted, and that non-action leads to the utmost governance.»

**Chapter Four: The Dao/Way of Non-Action and Its Application (Continued)**

This chapter elucidates the subtle origin’s function—its application through non-action. It begins by marking *Dao suong* (冲), demonstrating the ultimate source of emptiness. Next, it speaks of *cuòjiě* (挫解), clarifying how *suong* (冲) resolves discord. It concludes by likening it to the Emperor of the Mythic Age, intending to make its essence fully known.

**Explanation:**
The Dao’s application is boundless—vast enough to encompass heaven and earth, yet subtle enough to permeate the finest hairs. Serene and self-sufficient, it neither lacks nor overflows. Applied to the body, it harmonizes dust and light; wielded within, it transforms sharpness into tranquility. Even before the eons of the Mythic Age, it stood as the foremost principle. Among all teachings, only the Dao is worthy of reverence. Thus, all things converge toward it.

*Qu* (趣) means "to turn toward." Though the Dao’s application through *suong* (冲) may seem unfilled, it is not truly so. **Annotation:** The Dao’s movement generates *suonghé* (冲和) qi, and its function in creation never overflows. The phrase "or seems" acknowledges that the Dao cannot be definitively described.

**Deep and still,** it resembles the origin of all things. **Annotation:** *Yuān* (渊), meaning profound and tranquil, describes the Dao’s constant generation of all things without overflow. Its subtle origin is deep and still, thus appearing as the sovereign of all things.

**Commentary:** *Suong* (冲) is emptiness—meaning the Dao’s function lies in its void. The harmonious qi of *suong* (冲) and emptiness constitutes the Dao’s application, giving rise to all things, which benefit from its effects. Though the effects may seem radiant and vast, the Dao itself remains unfilled, its origin profound and still, eternally the source of all things. The annotation "or seems" reflects that the Dao has no fixed form, hence cannot be spoken of directly. The rest follows this pattern.

**Explanation:** The Dao is ever humble, unfilled, harmonious, and serene, dwelling within all things. Deeply mysterious and still, it governs them. Thus, when things lose the Dao’s *suonghé* (冲和), they suffer harm and perish; when people lose it, they die; when rulers lose it, governance falters and the people scatter; when ministers lose it, their reputation fades and they are disgraced. Therefore, the Dao of *suonghé* (冲和) is the foundation of all things’ security, the sovereign of all things.

When speaking of its influence on things, it appears radiant and vast; when seeking its origin, it is profound, still, and ever-empty. The Dao has no fixed form—it cannot be spoken of as having definite attributes, yet all things are governed by it. **Compliance** with this principle means not presuming to define it.

It dulls sharpness and resolves discord. **Annotation:** Because the Dao is *suonghé* (冲和), it restrains harshness and disperses turmoil. If vulgar learning seeks to restore [original purity], it only entangles further.

**Commentary:** *Cuò* (挫) means to restrain; *ruì* (锐) means sharp; *jiě* (解) means to disperse. The function of *suong* (冲) and emptiness is irresistible to all things, so sharp desires and tumultuous affairs, when met with the Dao’s *suonghé* (冲和), naturally subside and disperse. This teaches people the Dao’s application.

**Annotation:** The phrase "vulgar learning seeks to restore" refers to the *Zhuangzi* [*Xiu Xing* Chapter], which states: *"To refine nature in the vulgar world, vulgar learning seeks to restore its origin."* Sharpness and discord arise from desires, so recalling the Dao dulls and resolves them, while vulgar learning only deepens entanglement.

**Explanation:** Governing the realm with the Dao of *suonghé* (冲和) means there are no sharp emotions to harm things, no laborious affairs to weary people. Without harm to things, all nations come willingly, the four barbarians turn to civilization, arms are not raised, grievances do not arise, and there is no boasting of territorial expansion or domination of the weak.

「Not harming people, then the people are governed in due course, with light duties and taxes, and households are well-provisioned, people’s needs met.

In governing oneself, one resolves discord and dulls sharpness, without external invasion or rivalry, internally embracing clarity and purity—spirit serene, body at ease, tranquil and naturally contented.

*"This teaches people the Dao’s application"*—those who are enlightened must rely on the Dao.

The *Zhuangzi* [*Xiu Xing* Chapter] states: *"Vulgar learning seeks to restore its origin"*—this means that once people have rationalized within the vulgar world, they then wish to use vulgar learning to recover the original nature of life and death. The more they seek, the further they stray from the Dao.

Vulgar learning only deepens entanglement: sharp and restless hearts, chaotic affairs—if they are not resolved and dispersed by the Dao, then they are bound by vulgar learning, ever more knotted and fixed, beyond release.

Vulgar learning is the pursuit of mundane studies, not the Dao of ceaseless depletion.

*"Blending its radiance, harmonizing with dust."* **Annotation:** The Dao is ever-present, yet its presence is always without form. In light, it becomes one with light; in dust, it becomes one with dust—though neither light nor dust itself. It appears as though it might exist, yet does not.

*"Qí [淇]—as if something remains."* **Annotation:** In blending radiance and harmonizing with dust, the subtle essence remains unmixed. Hence, it appears as if something remains.

**Explanation:** The Dao’s *suonghé* (冲和) permeates all living beings, vast and unobstructed. All things exist within it; thus, it may be called blending radiance and harmonizing with dust. Light refers to clarity and purity; dust to confusion and chaos. Those who follow the Dao do not rigidly distinguish themselves but instead merge with the multitude. Though the Dao permeates all, its most refined essence remains concentrated and tranquil, never depleted or exhausted. Hence, it is said to persist.

I do not know whose child it is—it precedes the *Xiàngdì* (象帝). **Annotation:** I do not know its origin, for the Dao’s essence is not something born of generation. Thus, it has no father. The Dao appears as if it precedes the *Xiàngdì*—the sovereign of all things.

The *Xiàngdì* is the sovereign who nurtures all things, the origin of flourishing and growth. *Xiàng* means "as if."

**Explanation:** The *Xiàngdì* is the primal force from which all transformations arise, the sovereign who first establishes form and order, guiding all with the *Dao* of kingship. The great Dao of *suonghé* (冲和) generates all transformations, thus existing even before the *Xiàngdì*. The Sage-Laozi, being most enlightened, surely knew the Dao’s fundamental source! Yet he posed this apparent paradox to awaken those lost in vulgar ways—just as he did earlier when explaining that the Dao cannot be directly named.

*"The Sage-Laozi said: The *Xiàngdì* emerges from the *Zhèn* (震) [trigram]."* This is from the *Yì* [*Xì Yǔ* Chapter]. *Zhèn* is the eastern trigram, the rising *shǎoyáng* (少阳) qi—the source of all transformations. Now, with the heir apparent dwelling in the eastern palace, the *shǎoyáng* position, and ascending the throne as the time of emergence from *Zhèn*, it symbolizes the beginning of heaven and earth’s nurturing of all things.

*"As if it sees the forms"*—the Dao is formless, yet it manifests forms. *Qi* (气) is formless; *xiàng* (象) is the manifestation of form. The Dao is the first principle of all things.

The first principle of all things appears as if it precedes the *Xiàngdì*. The great Dao, however, has no true end nor beginning—who can know what precedes it? It is merely a rhetorical device to convey its boundless expanse.

The *Yì* states: *"The *Xiàngdì* emerges from the *Zhèn* (震) [trigram], and all things are born. It aligns with the *Sūn* (巽) [trigram], and all things are purified and harmonized. It manifests mutually with the *Lí* (离) [trigram], and the sage faces south toward brightness to govern. It administers duties through the *Kūn* (坤) [trigram], and all things receive sustenance. It speaks with grace through the *Guāng* (光) [trigram], and all things delight. It wages conflict through the *Qián* (乾) [trigram], and yin and yang clash. It labors through the *Kǎn* (坎) [trigram], and all things return. It completes through the *Gèn* (艮) [trigram], and all things reach their end."*

All things arise from *Zhèn* and conclude in *Gèn*—ending yet beginning anew, cycling through transformations without end. Yet the *Xiàngdì* emerges even before this *Zhèn*, and the Dao precedes the *Xiàngdì*, thus enabling it to be the sovereign of all transformations and the primal origin of heaven and earth.

The ruler embodies the Dao in heart, with no overreaching ambitions, pure and still like a clear spring. Governing all directions, he avoids external sharpness and contention, while below him, chaotic affairs cease. He blends with heaven’s radiance to illuminate all, yet contains the dust of the world while maintaining supreme dignity.

His effortless transformation may be likened to the *Xiàngdì*.

The *Broad Explication of the True Scripture of the Dao and Virtue* concludes its eighth volume. The *Broad Explication of the True Scripture of the Dao and Virtue* begins its ninth volume.

**Chapter Five: "Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent"**
*Attributed to Master Guangcheng of the Tang by Du Guangting*

**Explication:**
The previous chapter elucidated the subtle origin and effortless application of the Dao—action without doing. This chapter exposes partial favor as private inclination, for narrow self-interest makes universal care difficult.

It begins by likening all things to *chúdòu* (sacrificial straw dogs), illustrating heaven and earth’s impartial forgetfulness. Next, it compares them to *tuóruì* (windbags and flutes), demonstrating how emptiness yields without resistance. It concludes with the exhaustion of excessive speech, urging adherence to the *Zhōnghé* (Central Harmony).

**Meaning:**
To cling to benevolence as benevolence is to be bound by it; to not cling to benevolence as benevolence is to be without private favor. The sovereign’s regard for all living beings is like heaven and earth’s regard for all things. All things arise and transform of themselves—heaven and earth do not claim the merit. All beings dwell and reside—sovereigns do not claim the virtue. To rely on the subtle *qi* for inspiration and the mysterious transformation for creation is the ultimate transformation.

Yet if one speaks of their benevolence and virtue, the logic will inevitably reach its limits. Why? Heaven and earth’s benevolence is vast, yet grasses and trees wither in winter and flourish in summer. The sovereign’s benevolence is vast, yet punishments include exile and the axe. It is not as great as the benevolence of *not* clinging to benevolence.

To uphold the *Chōnghé* (Supreme Harmony) and preserve purity and stillness is the essential key to governing oneself.

Heaven and earth are not benevolent—they treat all things as *chúdòu*.
The Sage is not benevolent—they treat the people as *chúdòu*.
**Annotation:** *Not benevolent* means not acting with benevolent favor. *Chúdòu* refers to straw shaped into a dog’s form.

Dogs are kept for guarding, and thus receive the恩 of shelter and food. But *chúdòu* merely has the form of a dog without its barking or guarding function, so it is without regard for benevolence. This shows that heaven and earth regard humans as they do *chúdòu*—without expectation or demand.

Let us examine this further: Ultimate benevolence knows no partiality—how then does it encompass love? If love is not ultimate, it is merely partial favor. If one does not love only their own kin, then all under heaven are kin. If one does not cherish only their own children, then all under heaven are children. Thus, ultimate benevolence’s lack of partiality is in fact the most profound kinship. Is this not the meaning of *comprehensive love*?

**Explication:**
*Benevolence* is the name for *comprehensive love*. *Chú* means grass—referring to straw shaped into a dog for sacrificial use.

Zhuangzi says: *Master Jin spoke to Yan Hui: "When the sacrificial straw dog has not yet been used, it is adorned with embroidered cloth. But once it has been used, the kitchen attendants take it to cook. Now, if the Master takes the already-used straw dogs of former kings and treasures them among his disciples, it is like the traveler who treads upon them or the woodcutter who burns them. Alas, the Master’s path will end in ruin!"*

Yan Hui asked: *"What do you mean?"*
Master Jin replied: *"When the sacrificial straw dog is not yet used, it is wrapped in fine brocade and adorned with embroidery. The ritual officers fast and purify themselves before presenting it. But once it has been used, travelers trample it, and woodcutters burn it for firewood. If you were to try to reclaim it and store it again, it would be absurd. Now, the Master takes the already-used straw dogs of former kings and gathers disciples to revere them. Thus, he was attacked in Song, exiled in Wei, driven into poverty in Shang and Zhou, and besieged in Chen and Cai. This is like the traveler’s tread or the woodcutter’s fire!"*

Dogs bark and guard—yet the *chúdòu* has no such function. Heaven and earth regard all things as they do *chúdòu*: they do not demand barking or guarding, nor do they claim creation as benevolent favor. They do not expect repayment, nor do they proclaim their virtue—thus, they are *not benevolent*.

Humans show dogs kindness by sheltering and burying them properly. But toward *chúdòu*, they show no such regard. This clarifies that the Sage does not take *comprehensive love* as benevolence.

**Annotation on *pronei* (sheltering):**
*The Book of Rites* says: When Confucius’ dog died, he had Zi Gong bury it, saying: *"I have heard that a worn-out curtain is not discarded—it is used to bury a horse. The ruler’s carriage horses are buried with curtains. A worn-out mat is not discarded—it is used to bury a dog. I, Zhong You, am poor and have no mat. When I bury it, I will also place a mat beneath it so its head does not sink into the earth."*

*"Not loving only one’s own kin"* is from *The Rites of Zhou*: *"When the Great Way prevails, all under heaven is for the public. One does not love only one’s own kin, nor cherish only one’s own children. Love is extended to all things, and the public good is pursued without partiality."*

Between heaven and earth, is it not like the *tuóruì*?

**Annotation:**
*Tuó* is a windbag; *ruì* is a flute. The windbag’s bellows and the flute’s breath are both empty and without intent, yet they move and resonate. Thus, the creation of all things without partiality by heaven and earth is also due to their emptiness and lack of fixed purpose.

「Empty yet unyielding, moving yet ever more forth. **Annotation:** The *tuóruì*’s emptiness is unyielding; when it is stirred, the more it emits sound and *qi*. This illustrates the Sage’s heart without partial love—never strained or obstructed, its responses endless, truly moving yet ever more forth.

**Commentary:** *Tuó* is the windbag, which uses bellows of skin to blow wind and ignite fire. *Ruì* is the flute, which employs bamboo pipes to channel *qi*. The windbag cannot stir without the flute to guide its breath, nor can the flute channel *qi* without the windbag to supply it. These two rely on each other in action, just as heaven and earth—*tuó* as heaven, the five *qi* as *ruì*—hold the empty yet dynamic principle to produce myriad distinctions, never exhausting themselves. When the ruler maintains an empty heart and practices the Dao, ministers and officials embody his virtue and actions, just as heaven and earth move the five *qi* without depletion. Thus, governance is unstrained, and the four seas are in peace. "Moving yet ever more forth" signifies endlessness.

The virtue of *chúnhuà* (pure and harmonious transformation) is uniform, permeating all things. "Daily use yet unaware" is from *The Book of Changes*’s **系辞传 (Xìyī Shìyán):** *"The common people use it daily yet do not know."* This means the common people rely on this Dao daily to sustain life, yet they are unaware of its power. The Dao is profound and inscrutable; it does not seek recognition as a deed, so the people use it without knowing.

**Annotation:** *Lù* (屈) means exhaustion. Excessive speech leads to depletion, and depletion means exhaustion. Universal love is hard to exhaust, yet it breeds resentment and strife, so it is better to embrace the central harmony, letting all things naturally suffice.

**Commentary:** Excessive speech refers to frequent talk of universal love. Though one speaks much of it, acting on it is difficult to exhaust, so speech depletes without fulfillment. Thus, it is better to forget the mind and respond with emptiness, holding fast to central harmony, letting all things naturally suffice.

**Annotation:** *Chóu* (酬) means to repay. This refers to empty words that do not yield corresponding deeds.

**Explanation:** Excessive speech leads to ruin; excessive action leads to harm. Too much speech invites exhaustion and depletion. Frequent governance through speech means constant decrees and nightly reversals of orders—this is depletion. Too much speech in personal conduct is also clearly detrimental. Hence, one lost word cannot be recalled even by four horses; how much more so with excessive speech, which cannot avoid disgrace? Words can distort truth, turning firmness into discord and reversing black into white. Guarding against words is more urgent than guarding against rivers—one must be cautious. It is better to remain silent and uphold central harmony: in governance, it does not exhaust decrees; in personal conduct, it does not invite disgrace. Receiving *qi* with minimal speech, guarding virtue within, and practicing the Dao without words—this is true excellence.

**Chapter Six: "The Valley Spirit Never Dies"**

**Commentary:** The previous chapter explained universal love and the perils of partiality, showing that partiality makes universal love difficult. This chapter illustrates the utmost emptiness and responsiveness, whose effects are inexhaustible. It begins with the *Valley Spirit* (谷神), using the metaphor of the spirit to elucidate the Dao. Next, it speaks of the *Dark Mother* (玄牝), distinguishing the profound origin of all things. It concludes with *glossed subtlety*, showing that emptiness and responsiveness require no effort.

**Explanation:** The spirit is what is inscrutable between yin and yang—empty yet responsive, stirred and immediately communicating. Some say it refers to nourishing through the *Valley* (谷), meaning to nourish the spirit aligns with the principle of "never dying." Others say it refers to echoing responses: the Dao responds to all things like an inscrutable spirit. The *Valley Spirit* breathes in and out the primordial harmony. Refining the spirit and *qi*, prolonging form and breath, aligning with heaven’s vitality—this is the Dao of eternal life. The *Valley Spirit never dies*, **Annotation:** The *Valley* is that which is empty yet responsive. The spirit is that which is subtle and inscrutable. *Death* here means rest. The *Valley Spirit*’s responses are unknown; when stirred, it responds, like a spirit. The response of a spirit never rests; to illustrate the supreme Dao’s emptiness in generating all things and its subtle, ineffable use, the *Valley Spirit* is used as an analogy.

This is called the *Dark Mother*. **Annotation:** *Dark* means profound. *Mother* means origin. The *Valley Spirit* responds to all things, its use boundless and inscrutable, profoundly subtle and inexhaustible. It can give birth to all things, so it is named the *Dark Mother*, to elucidate the great Dao’s function in generating life.

**Commentary:** The *Valley Spirit* refers to the *Valley*’s echoing response, like the Dao’s response to all things—when stirred, it responds, like a spirit. The spirit is named for its inscrutability; *death* here means rest. The inscrutable response never rests, hence "the *Valley Spirit* never dies." *Dark* means profound; *Mother* means origin. The *Valley Spirit*’s response is profoundly subtle and ineffable, nurturing all things—thus, it is called the *Dark Mother*.

**Explanation:** The *Valley Spirit* has three aspects. First, it contains emptiness: when there is sound, it responds; the Dao’s essence is without form, yet cultivation brings it forth. Second, the spirit has no form: when analyzed, it attends to stimuli; the Dao has no image, yet cultivation makes it eternal. Third, the echo resides in the *Valley*: without sound, it does not respond; the Dao resides in the body: without cultivation, it does not manifest. *Never dying* does not refer to physical death, but to the death of rest. If interpreted as nourishing the body, it means the death of physical life. But if it means nourishing the spirit, then eternal life and non-dying are achieved.

The second aspect: the echo responds without rest—this is the death of rest.

Now, *playing* (玄) is Heaven. In the human body, it is the nose.
*Mother* (牝) is Earth. In the human body, it is the mouth.

The primordial *qi* of harmony and the luminous spirit, within the body, enter and exit through the nose and mouth in breath, nourishing the body. Thus, it is called the *Valley Spirit*.

Moreover, the five *qi* of Heaven enter through the nose, and their spirit is called *hun* (魂), ascending to communicate with Heaven. The five flavors of Earth enter through the mouth, and their spirit is called *po* (魄), descending to communicate with Earth.

It is said: When one nourishes *qi*, they align with Heaven. If this is sustained without ceasing, they may attain longevity. This is *yang* refining *yin*.

When one consumes flavors, they align with Earth. If this is sustained without ceasing, it brings illness and leads to death. This is *yin* refining *yang*.

The Venerable Master commands: "Nourish the spirit and treasure the form, abstain from grains and eat *qi*, for this is the Way of non-death."

Thus, it is called the *Dark Mother’s Gate*—the root of Heaven and Earth.

The *Dark Mother’s Gate* is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
**Annotation:** Profoundly subtle and empty, it can mother all things.
All things emerge from it—thus, it is called the *Gate*.
Heaven and Earth have form, so they rely on this *root* as their foundation.

**Commentary:** The function of the *Dark Mother* responds to all stimuli. All things emerge from it, hence it is called the *Gate*.
Heaven and Earth are the greatest of formed things. Without the function of the *Dark Mother*, they would fragment and disperse, so they rely on this *root* as their foundation.

Thus, it is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
*Root* is *foundation*.

**Explanation:** It is not only that humans rely on the *Dark Mother’s* circulation of *qi* to attain longevity.
Even Heaven and Earth must rely on the Dao’s *qi* and nourishment to remain serene and unchanging.

The subsequent text states: "If Heaven lacks serenity, it will fear fragmentation; if Earth lacks stability, it will fear eruption."
When Heaven and Earth lose the Dao, they still face the perils of collapse and dispersion—how much more so for the human body, which does not guard the central unity?

Continuous as if preserved, its use is effortless.
**Annotation:** The function of the empty *Mother* is subtly enduring, responding as if preserved, its use without intent, hence without labor.

**Commentary:** *Continuous* means subtly unending.
The function of the empty *Mother* responds to all without favor.
Subtle and profound, it is as if preserved; without favor, its use is effortless.

**Explanation:** Heaven and Earth act naturally with *qi*, thus enduring.
Humans, through nasal and oral breathing, should be subtly enduring—preserved yet as if nonexistent—never hasty or exhausted.

The Way of governing the realm, when policies are enacted, must balance severity with leniency, and leniency with severity. For if policies are too lenient, the people grow slack; if too severe, they suffer harm.

If one governs the world with the Dao of serenity and stability, letting the people engage in no laborious exertion, then the common folk will naturally attach themselves, and their blessings will endure, subtly preserved like the unbroken lineage of gourds and vines.

Thus, it is said: *Continuous as if preserved, its use is effortless.*

**Commentary (Chapter Seven: "Heaven Long, Earth Enduring"):** The previous chapter clarified the *Valley Spirit’s* empty response—empty response is inexhaustible.
This chapter clarifies Heaven and Earth’s lack of partiality—without partiality, they endure.

First, it uses Heaven and Earth as an analogy; next, it invokes the Sage to further elucidate; concluding with the transformation of non-partiality into partiality.
This is to encourage diligent practice of this method.

**Explanation:** The previous chapter expounded on the *Dark Mother’s* circulation of *qi*, with Heaven and Earth acting naturally upon it.
This chapter marks *Heaven long, Earth enduring*, aligning with the natural function of the *Dark Mother*.
The Sage’s governance must embody Heaven and Earth’s function, thus ensuring peace for the people and stability for the nation.

Heaven and Earth act without partiality, hence their endurance.
The Sage, without partiality, applies the Dao—all things return to it.
*Heaven long, Earth enduring.*

**Annotation:** This marks Heaven and Earth’s endurance to illustrate that without partiality or intent, one can endure and last.

**Commentary:** This is the opening question of the chapter.
Heaven is called *long* due to its *qi* and form; Earth is called *enduring* due to its substance and solidity.

**Explanation:** The Venerable Master seeks to elucidate the meaning of *Heaven long, Earth enduring* to teach the rulers of the world.
Thus, at the chapter’s beginning, he poses the question himself.

Heaven, as *qi* and form, is said in *Liezi*: "Heaven is accumulated *qi*; there is no place without *qi*. Earth is accumulated mass; there is no place without mass."
Accumulated *qi* forms an image—an image of emptiness;
Accumulated mass forms substance—substance of reality.
*The Book of Changes (Systematic Commentary)* states: "In Heaven, it forms images; on Earth, it forms shapes—transformation and change are manifest."
Above as image, below as form, thus they transform and generate all things.

The reason Heaven and Earth can endure is that they do not generate themselves, hence they can endure and generate.
**Annotation:** Though Heaven and Earth’s virtue and function are vast in nurturing all things, they endure because they draw upon the Dao’s foundation, not arrogating credit for their own creation.

**Commentary:** The preceding sentence posed the question.
This responds by saying: "The reason Heaven and Earth can endure is that they cover and nourish all things, all creatures drawing upon the wondrous origin, not arrogating credit for their generative function.
Another interpretation: *Not generating themselves* means Heaven and Earth merely generate and nourish all things without self-enrichment, hence they can endure and generate.

**Explanation:** The Venerable Master, to elucidate this meaning of endurance, poses the question himself—just as literary masters employ figures like the *Non-existent Prince*, *Mr. Nonexistent*, or *East Gate Master*.
He establishes the principle, asks the question, and answers it himself to reveal the matter.

Having asked in the previous sentence about *Heaven long, Earth enduring*, this sentence answers: "Heaven and Earth circulate the primordial harmonizing *qi* of the *yuan* and *he* phases, generating all classes of beings. The beings, having obtained life, Heaven and Earth do not rely on their virtue or claim their function, hence they endure."

If one relies on one’s deeds, then those deeds grow trifling.
If one relies on one’s virtue, then that virtue becomes shallow.
By not relying on virtue or deeds, virtue becomes boundless and deeds vast—
all things return to their source, and thus Heaven and Earth endure.

A sovereign governing the realm should model the Dao’s transformations,
entrusting all things to effortless action.
When the people flourish in harmony, peace naturally prevails.

In cultivating one’s self, there should be no toil of scheming or anxious deliberation,
no vain pursuit of fame or indulgence in desires.
When the spirit rests within and the *qi* harmonizes internally,
then the nation’s fate extends far, and one’s lifespan prolongs—
just as Heaven and Earth endure through impartiality.

Thus, the Sage places himself last, yet comes first;
sets himself aside, yet remains preserved.

**Annotation:** Placing oneself last means others willingly exalt him, so he comes first.
Setting oneself aside means the heart attains serene detachment, so he remains preserved.

**Exegesis:** Therefore, the Sage emulates Heaven and Earth’s universal nourishment,
bestowing without partiality, so he is first in being revered by the people,
sustained by those beneath him, hence he comes first.
He does not arrogate nobility nor slight his own person—
when the world reveres his virtue, he fears no harm, hence he remains preserved.

**Meaning:** Governing the realm without arrogance or self-serving action,
without exhausting the people for his own sustenance—
this is what is meant by placing oneself last and setting oneself aside.

The sovereigns of antiquity embraced a will vast as Heaven and Earth,
their blessings extending to all under Heaven, yet they were unknown—
their lives lacked rank, their deaths lacked posthumous titles,
their deeds were not extolled. Their substance was not hoarded,
their names not established;
the people willingly honored them, all things joyfully upheld them—
truly, they placed themselves last yet came first,
set themselves aside yet remained preserved.

As dynasties declined, their rulers did the opposite:
indulging their own desires while enslaving others,
exhausting the people’s strength to serve themselves—
the people grew weary, governance faltered, and the realm abandoned them.
This is the loss of the Way of placing oneself last and setting oneself aside.

How could it compare to shattering a jade pillow,
burning a phoenix-feather robe,
abandoning a grand hall’s expenses,
or turning away a thousand-li steed—
his virtue would shine in his age, his name immortalized in bamboo and silk?

Those who cultivate their person do not crave noble titles—
this is setting oneself aside.
They do not rush forward in ambition—
this is placing oneself last.
Thus, their person remains preserved while their virtue flourishes,
their virtue flourishes and the people submit—
truly, they come first and remain preserved.
To oppose this is to stray far from the Way.

Is it not because they were without private gain?
Thus, they achieved their greatest private good.

**Annotation:** Heaven and Earth forget their nurturing deeds—
without private gain, they endure long and vast,
achieving their own private good.

The Sage places himself last and sets himself aside—
without private gain, he comes first and remains preserved,
achieving his own private good.

**Exegesis:** The Sage’s governance follows natural transformation,
without exclusive insight, not indulging in life’s excesses,
not boasting of his virtues, not striving to lead the world—
thus he stands above others without claiming superiority over the world.
Hence he enjoys enduring prosperity.

Thus, the myriad myriads rest in harmony,
barbarians bow in reverence,
weapons fall silent, ancestral temples stand secure.
This is a private good of the greatest magnitude—
precisely because he does not cling to private gain as private,
he achieves this radiant and vast fulfillment.

In cultivating the self, virtue flourishes and the people submit,
the Way aligns with the numinous, lifespan extends—
his private good is vast,
yet it arises from not indulging in private desires.

The *Lingbao Jing* states:
Those who dwell in the world, greedy for pleasure and chasing desires,
find joy now and suffering later.
Why?
Excessive indulgence in ease leads to falling into the Three Abysses.

Those who study the Dao abandon gain and forget fame,
endure cold lodgings and refine their conduct,
ultimately attaining the Way of the Transcendent—
first suffering, then joy.
Why?
Their accumulated merit ascends to the Nine Heavens.

**End of Volume Nine of the *Broad Explication of the Dao and Its Virtue***

**Preface to the *Broad Explication of the Dao and Its Virtue***

The *Zhutao Yuzha* states:
The Most High Laozi descended in traces and taught the Way,
his influence extending in four directions.
First, across countless kalpas, he assumed forms,
adapting to each age’s transformations—
as seen in the thousand-two-hundred titles and one-hundred-eighty names
scattered through the scriptures, which may be verified.

Second, at the dawn of this kalpa’s *Kaihuang* era,
his transformative power nurtured Heaven and Earth,
conceiving the sun and moon as the root of creation,
the foundation of Heaven and Earth.
He dispersed *qi* and divided light,
generating all classes of beings—
from the Five Sovereigns down to the pre-Yin and pre-Zhou eras,
he served as the teachers of emperors,
appearing in each dynasty—
as in the cases of Yuhua, Lutu, Guangcheng, and Yin Shou,
who manifested according to circumstances and took names accordingly.

As the Three Sovereigns passed and the Five Emperors declined,
the *Yunji Longshi* faded with shifting ages,
the *Niuguan Huoyun* waned as rivers flowed and winds shifted—
their steps diverged, purity diluted, and though they yielded to virtue,
wars repeatedly arose.

At the Shanquan, there were armies of the slain;
at the Danpu, there were troops of conquest.
Cunning and deceit prevailed while Great Simplicity hid,
benevolence and love shone while filial piety and compassion emerged,
mystery and silence grew rare, daily growing thinner.

Emperor Yao, weary in old age, relinquished his throne,
while Shun, through trials, was chosen as ruler—
he governed the myriad regions with care,
labored over the people’s affairs.
Yet the Way of tranquil serenity eluded him.

Laozi, surnamed Yin Shouzi, resided in Heyang,
and transmitted the *Dao De Jing* to Shun.
The text’s essence teaches:
The Dao takes non-action as its first principle,
virtue takes having a name as its secondary principle—
just as the writings of the Three Sovereigns speak of the Great Dao,
and those of the Five Emperors speak of the Constant Dao.

Below this, there are the meanings of *Bozaifei* and *Jian’ai*,
the principles of *Jian’ai* and *Ren*,
the moderation of *Yin-Yang* etiquette,
the curbing of sharp cleverness,
the rejection of violent warfare,
the suppression of deceitful schemes—
to restore simplicity and return to purity,
to govern through non-action and non-interference.

Though Shun exerted himself in implementing these,
he exiled the wicked and appointed ministers,
clarified his vision and sharpened his hearing,
harmonized the nine clans,
and adjudicated the people—
yet the Way of tranquil serenity remained unattained.

Thus, after the reigns of Yu and Tang, the world became a private domain,
each cherishing their own kin, each fathering their own children.
The Great Dao having withdrawn, the mysterious transformations ceased to flow,
rituals and music grew elaborate, and governance and penal codes were put to great use.

**The Third Manifestation:**
The Old Master, in the guise of a divine descent upon the *Jia* of Shangyang,
conceived in the year of King Wu Ding’s reign,
was born in Bo—now the Nine-Dragon Well in Zhēnyuān County—
where the Hall of Supreme Clarity stands.
Now hidden, now revealed, he subtly transformed the myriad lands.
In the year *Gui-Chou* of King Zhao of Zhou,
he transmitted these two *Canons* to the Grand Overseer of Guan, Yín Xǐ,
who then passed them to the world, allowing all to hear them.

**The Fourth Manifestation:**
When the transformation reached the Flowing Sands,
he met Yín Xǐ at the market of Qingyang in Western Shu,
manifesting his birth in the year *Ding-Sì* of King Zhao.
This *Canon of Dao and Virtue*, transmitted from Hangu Pass,
was revered across generations.

The interpretations of its principles vary among these schools—
some delving deeply into the *Zhōngxuān* (Mysterious Depths),
others avoiding the pitfalls of empty idealism.

「Some are drowned in advocating *karma* and *cause-and-effect*, fixating on the *Three Lifetimes* (三生).
Others blend it with Confucian teachings, or incline toward the emptiness of *Nirvana*.
None fail to delve into the *Líshì* (骊室)—the hidden chamber—
or to vie in collecting *Zhūjī* (珠玑)—precious pearls and jade,
ascending *Zhōngshān* (锺山)—the resonant peak—
and competing to gaze upon *Guāngdàng* (珪瓒)—celestial orbs.
With *Liánchéng* (连城)—the linked treasures—held firm,
illuminating *Zhàochéng* (照乘)—the radiant vehicle—swells their hearts.

When they expound upon *inner cultivation* (内修),
the *Eight Immortal Jade Elixirs* (八琼玉雪) shimmer in the *Dāntián* (丹田)—the cinnabar field—;
the *Nine Refined Lingzhi Salves* (九转琅膏) gleam at the *Jiànguē* (绛阙)—the vermilion gate.
They exhaust the subtleties of the *Six Qi* (六气)—the six cosmic breaths—
and perfect the *Five Spirits* (五灵)—the five celestial intelligences—
in their auxiliary functions.
Forgotten in the mind, still in the foot,
they attain *nothingness* yet comprehend the *primordial transformation* (化元).

When they speak of *verification through practice* (品证),
they dispel the dust of mundane concerns,
transcend the highest ranks,
roam the *Eight Outer Realms* (八外) in boundless freedom,
point to the *Three Realms* (三境) and ascend,
treading the station of *Tàiyī* (太一)—the Supreme Unity.
Yet none surpass them in grasping the essence of *inner and outer* (内外),
or in harmonizing the capacities of *human and heaven* (人天).

Our *Emperor Xuánzōng of the Open Dao* (开元至道昭肃孝皇帝),
who manifested the *Dragon Transformation* (神龙变),
inherited the *Xiàng* (象)—the Daoist symbols—from his predecessors,
and pacified internal strife with the *buyinguan* (乾)—the Heavenly Vessel,
consulting the *revitalization of the Middle Kingdom* (中兴),
ascended the throne in *governance* (御极).
For forty-five years, he practiced *wuwei* (无为)—non-action—
in the *Ròuyòu* (宥)—the embrace of tolerance,
leaving no trace of toil at *Fénshuǐ* (汾水) or *Xiāngchéng* (襄城),
nor in the *Qǔdàyuàn* (具茨大院)—the grand retreat.
He expanded the *Eight Mists* (八溟) as the *Rénshòu* (仁寿)—the benevolent longevity—palace,
and encompassed the *Ten Thousand Abodes* (万寓) as the *Huáxiū* (华胥)—the radiant land—realm.

The *Dao of Dao* (至道) and *Virtue of Virtue* (至德) are exalted and clear,
revered as sacred scriptures,
foundational teachings of our dynasty.
The *Xiàng* (象) and *Xì* (系) are insufficient for analogy,
the *Odes of Wind* (大风) and *Odes of雅* (雅) cannot fully illustrate.

It spans antiquity to the present, standing alone in the cosmos.
Though many scholars have penned commentaries,
they have not exhausted the myriad mysteries of the *Dao*,
nor have they reached the realm of *Zhōngxuān* (重玄)—the profound depths.

With *Yīngzōng* (凝旒) leisurely at hand,
and *Shǔxiǎng* (属想) thoughts directed,
he personally annotated the *Eighty-One Chapters* (八十一章),
composing a six-volume exposition.
Within, it encompasses the fundamentals of *self-cultivation* (修身) without omission;
without, it exhausts the strategies for *governing the state* (理国), from the grand to the minute.

Its elegance spreads far and wide,
outshining the *Five Clouds* (五云) in splendor,
while heavenly radiance descends,
enhancing the brilliance of the *Two Suns* (两曜).
It indeed can rival *Ji Sì’s Ten Wings* (季仲《十翼》),
and illuminate the *Two Southern Classics* (《二南》).

If one directly receives from the *Primordial Dao* (玄元),
or sincerely transmits from the *Supreme Sage* (太上),
then it surpasses the *Nine Schools* (九流) and leads them all,
and its teachings endure through the *Ten Thousand Ages* (万古) unrevoked.

Thus, the poems of *Great Wind* (大风) and *Red Wild Geese* (朱雁)
are truly inadequate to follow its grandeur,
and the works of *Discourses on Rituals* (典论) and *Golden Tower* (金楼)
cannot be compared in the same era.

Yet in his commentaries and annotations,
he harmonizes scriptures and elucidates meanings,
drawing from the *Spring and Autumn Annals* (周书) and *Ru’s Histories* (鲁史),
and revealing mutual insights.
He traces the origins to *Qīyuán* (漆园)—the lacquer garden—
and extends the classifications of *Shǔlèi* (属类).

Later scholars, upon reading his works,
often remain bewildered by the source of his wisdom.
Thus, they gathered and excerpted from myriad texts,
studied and sought within the scrolls,
making comparisons as they found them,
ensuring all relevant materials were included,
and compiled the *Broad Explication of Sacred Dao* (广圣义) in thirty volumes.

The *Great Clarity* (大明) shines above,
yet the *candle flame* (爝火) never ceases;
the *vast waters* (巨泽) spread across the heavens,
yet the *soaking* (灌浸) never stops.
Truly, its profundity is immeasurable,
its annotations crudely fill the gaps in the text.

*Heavenly Restoration* (天复) year, *Dragon Gathering* (龙集) month,
*First Day of the Cycle* (辛酉) ninth month, sixteenth day.
*Record of the Daoist Master of Broad Perfection* (广成先生),
*Du Guāngtíng* (杜光庭) compiled.

**Volume Ten of the *Broad Explication of the Sacred Dao/Virtue Text*** (道德真经广圣义卷之十)

**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Virtue Resembles Water**

**Commentary:**
The previous chapter elucidates Heaven and Earth’s impartiality, their generative power ensuring enduring existence. This chapter expounds upon the sage’s practice of gentle strength, thus avoiding blame. It begins by likening the sage to water, illustrating the proximity of its three virtues to the Dao. Next, it speaks of dwelling on low ground, exhausting the seven virtues’ benefits to others. It concludes with “not contending,” urging adherence to gentleness to achieve ultimate victory.

**Exposition:**
The virtue of water is gentle and yielding, harmonious and unassuming, flowing according to time, adapting to any vessel—round or square—becoming springs when it pools, mist and dew when it disperses. All things perish without it; they thrive with it. It cannot be harmed by striking, nor grasped when held. Yet it falls short of the Dao because water has form while the Dao is formless. Though bound by form, its beneficent nature and yielding humility bring it close to the Dao.

The Sage of Laozi uses water as an analogy to exhort those cultivating the Way, urging them to embody the seven virtues and three abilities, govern with integrity, and practice non-contention—thus avoiding blame.

**The Supreme Virtue Resembles Water.**
**Annotation:** To illuminate the sage’s supreme virtue, water’s nature is held up as an analogy to the Dao.

**Commentary:** “Supreme virtue” marks the sage. “Resembles water” is the analogy. The sage’s emptiness is boundless, dwelling in the law without attachment, forgetting virtue while virtue is fulfilled—this is the highest virtue.

The sage’s conduct resembles water’s capacity, as detailed below, all containing both law and analogy.

**Exposition:** The sage of supreme virtue embodies the Dao, refines the mind, responds to circumstances, and benefits others with boundless adaptability. Laozi presents water’s virtues to inspire later learners, for water and the Dao are akin. The sage of supreme virtue forgets virtue as water forgets its own function. Water does not boast of its utility, yet its utility grows greater; virtue does not flaunt itself, yet its brilliance shines brighter. When both are vast and luminous, this is the highest virtue.

From the sovereign facing south to the recluse in the rocks, if one follows water’s example, the Dao will be attained.

**Law and Analogy:** Water serves as the analogy, the Dao as the principle, and the sage as the one who practices it.

Water benefits all things without contention, dwelling where others abhor.

**Commentary:** Water’s nature is sweet and cool, dispersing everywhere, nourishing what it touches, and thus fostering growth. Hence, it is said to benefit. This is the first ability.

**Exposition:** Sweetness is water’s taste; coolness, its essence. Water is the origin of *qi*, reigning in the North, its virtue to nourish below. Its color is black, its nature intelligent, its taste salty, its number six. The North marks the beginning of yang virtue and the end of yin *qi*. Its generative number is one, aligning with the Dao. The Dao is also one—one as the formless one; water is one as the formed one. The formless one is the Dao’s essence; the formed one, its manifestation. Thus, water embodies the Dao’s function. All things rely on its nourishment to thrive and flourish; because it nourishes, it sustains all life. Hence, it ranks first among the three abilities.

**Commentary:** Nothing is as yielding and weak as water. Its evenness is worthy of emulation; its clarity reflects others. When it flows, it follows the current; when obstructed, it submits. Led by others, it never contends. This is the second ability.

**Exposition:** Yielding and weakness are water’s virtues. In *The Classic of Virtue*, Chapter 41, it states: *“Nothing under heaven is as yielding and weak as water.”* Water’s virtues are reiterated to encourage adherence to gentleness.

Water, when still, does not flow; thus, it embodies equanimity and forgiveness as its foundation, making it worthy of imitation. Water’s stillness reflects all things, hence the saying: *“No one reflects in flowing water, but in still water, one does.”* Its clarity and tranquility make it so.

Water’s nature is even; when encountering unevenness, it passes; when meeting marshes or lakes, it stops. East, west, south, north—it follows where led, never contending, adaptable to all. Comparing virtues, its function in sustaining life surpasses others. Hence, it ranks second among the three abilities.

**Commentary:** People dislike lowly places, yet water seeks them, receiving filth without shame. This is the third ability.

**Exposition:** Human nature inclines toward convention; few are humble and yielding. Most prefer high positions, shunning lowly places. Yet water, dwelling low and unassuming, accepts impurity without dishonor. Compared to prior virtues, this is the greatest, hence the third ability. Thus, it nears the Dao.

**Annotation:** *Ji* means “near.”

**Commentary:** Benefiting others clarifies its expansive advantage; non-contention reveals its gentleness; dwelling in impurity demonstrates its capacity for inclusion. These are water’s three abilities. Only the sage unifies them in practice, thus nearing the Dao without straying far.

**Exposition:** With the three abilities, one nears the Dao. If a ruler embodies expansive benefit, holds humility, and practices inclusive tolerance, the world will achieve great peace. For those cultivating the self, diligence extends to all; gentleness governs nature, adapting to impurity, concealing traces, and dimming brilliance—thus, immortality may be hoped for.

**Dwelling in Virtuous Ground.**
**Annotation:** The sage of supreme virtue, in gentle weakness, dwells low like water, nourishing all. Earth’s virtue lies in its humility; water seeks lowly flows. The sage’s residence in virtuous ground mirrors this, benefiting others abundantly.

**Commentary:** The sage’s dwelling is virtuous, like water on the earth, multiplying benefits. Earth’s virtue is in its lowliness; water flows downward, aligning with the sage’s humility and gentleness, nearing the Dao’s nature. Hence, it is said to dwell in virtuous ground.

**Exposition:** This illustrates dwelling low and taking pleasure in humility as the means to stabilize the nation and preserve life. Heaven, being clear and light, thus employs its height. Earth, being turbid and thick, thus rests in lowliness.

**《I Ching》** speaks: *"Heaven is exalted, Earth is lowly; low and high are thus arranged."*

Again, it is said: *"The Way of Earth is low yet ascends; thus water flows downward and dwells low, mirroring the sage’s virtue of humility."*

**The mind is good at depth.**
**Annotation:** The mind, when deep and still, is like water settling in a spring.
**Exposition:** The sage’s mind excels in tranquility, like water’s nature—calm and still. Water stills and becomes clear; the mind at ease attains enlightenment. *Spring* refers to profound stillness. Hence, it is said: *"The mind is good at depth."*
**Meaning:** This illustrates clarity, stillness, and emptiness as the method for purifying oneself and cleansing the heart. *"A minister’s heart like water, a minister’s gate like a marketplace"*—is this not so?

**Giving is good and virtuous.**
**Annotation:** To give generously in accordance with supreme virtue is like water nourishing all things.
**Exposition:** The sage’s benevolence lies in aiding others. The act of giving aligns with virtue, flowing like water’s moistening—without favor or aversion. Hence, it is said: *"Giving is good and virtuous."*
**Meaning:** This illustrates nourishing all things as the practice of universal benevolence and aid. *"The more one gives to others, the more one possesses; the more one gives to others, the more one has."* This is its essence.

**Speech is good and trustworthy.**
**Annotation:** Words spoken are true and reliable, like water flowing through perilous paths without failing in trust.
**Exposition:** The sage’s words are ever true and sincere, transforming the common. Trustworthy speech knows no deceit, like a spring’s flow—how different is it from perilous paths? Hence, it is said: *"Speech is good and trustworthy."* The annotation says: *"Flowing through peril, yet never failing in trust"*—words from the *Zhouyi*’s *Kàn* (Abysm) hexagram.
**Meaning:** This illustrates truthfulness without deceit as the eternal and verifiable teaching. *"Flowing through peril yet never failing in trust"*—the *Zhouyi*’s *Kàn* hexagram states: *"Repeatedly encountering peril."* Water flows yet does not overflow; it traverses peril yet never fails in trust.

To govern a nation and lead the people, one must embody the Way, ensuring words are true and sincere. This can move Heaven and Earth, awaken the numinous—thus, good and evil words arise within a single room yet resonate a thousand miles away. This is the utmost of trust. Confucius said, *"Abandon food, abandon arms, yet preserve trust"*—how profound his words!

**Governance is good and orderly.**
**Annotation:** To govern well is to manage affairs like water cleansing all things, making them pure.
**Exposition:** *Governance* means rectification. The sage’s actions are spontaneous yet without contrivance; their demeanor enlightens others. Things follow what is right, and rightness governs itself—what else could it be? Like water’s nature, it washes and purifies all things. Hence, it is said: *"Governance is good and orderly."*
**Meaning:** This illustrates true rectification of things as the method for transforming the common into the sage. *"Rectifying demeanor to enlighten"*—from *Zhuangzi*’s *"Tiánzǐ Fāng"* (where Tiánzǐ, named Wúzé, attended upon Wèi Wén Hóu. Wén Hóu studied with Zǐxià but befriended Wúzé. Wúzé often spoke of the *Xīgōng*’s Way, and Wén Hóu took him as his teacher. Wúzé said: *"No, he is merely a villager from my district. I often spoke of the Way, so he praised me. My teacher was Dōngguō Shùnzǐ. His appearance was human, yet his spirit was celestial. He followed the True, his purity clear, and he received all things. When things strayed from the Way, he rectified his demeanor to enlighten them, causing their hearts and intentions to dissolve. Wúzé was unworthy of such praise. This is what is meant by: when things lose the Way, Dōngguō Shùnzǐ rectifies his demeanor, his heart merging with the Dao, and things, seeing him, naturally awaken. Their resolve vanishes—this is indeed speechless transformation, transformation without action. The true Way!"*

**Affairs are good and accomplished.**
**Annotation:** In affairs, one excels by adapting to tasks, like water’s nature—square or round, conforming to its vessel, never hindered by things.
**Exposition:** The sage’s clarity is unobstructed; in all movements and affairs, they are adept. Adeptness means illumination. Like water’s nature: when dammed, it becomes a pool; when released, a river. It floats boats, fills hollows—what it cannot do? Hence, it is said: *"Affairs are good and accomplished."*
**Meaning:** This illustrates adapting to circumstances and tasks as the method of responsive and fluid application. Water conforms in square or round, damming or flowing as the time demands, thus able to traverse the sea and float the heavens—vast and boundless. The ruler, with governance like trailing robes, entrusts tasks to the worthy, using them without doubt, each fulfilling their role. Thus, one may govern without action and attain the tranquil order of *Tàiníng*.

**Actions are good and timely.**
**Annotation:** Responding to things in due time, like water dispersing in spring and congealing in winter.
**Exposition:** The sage’s heart is like an empty valley. Compared to a mirror’s reflection, things stir and it responds. Like water’s nature: dispersing in spring, congealing in winter, waxing and waning with the seasons. Hence, it is said: *"Actions are good and timely."*
**Meaning:** This illustrates conduct aligning with the times as the precept for upholding the Way and preserving life. *Dispersion* means scattering. In spring, the sun’s warmth melts the ice; in winter, cold congeals the flow—water follows the seasons. The Way of governance, the method of self-cultivation: expanding and contracting with the times, following things’ nature—this is the utmost principle, this is the way to preserve life. Only the non-contending thus has no blame.

**Non-contention is supreme virtue.**
**Annotation:** The sage of supreme virtue has a vacant heart and follows things. Like water’s nature: when dammed, it stops; when released, it flows—never opposing things, thus no fault.
**Exposition:** *Fault* means error. The sage’s conduct harms nothing; their heart is yielding and complete, never competing. Waves ebb and flow, submitting thus—never clashing with things, leaving no room for fault.
**Meaning:** The virtue of non-contention is foremost among virtues. Common people cannot avoid contention. Those who contend multiply their affairs. Rebellion and disorder necessitate contention; cruelty and arrogance necessitate contention; anger and resentment necessitate contention; extravagance and indulgence necessitate contention; pride and boasting necessitate contention; victory and rivalry necessitate contention; defiance and stubbornness necessitate contention; ambition and acquisition necessitate contention; courage and cowardice necessitate contention; love and hatred necessitate contention; tyranny and favoritism necessitate contention.

「When a king harbors even one of these faults, his armies will rise within the realm. When a feudal lord harbors even one of these faults, his lands will be ravaged by war. When a high-ranking minister harbors even one of these faults, his household will be beset by treachery and disorder. When a commoner harbors even one of these faults, it will bring harm upon himself. All such faults originate from unchecked thoughts, neglect of ritual and law, lack of reverence, and inability to tolerate. Thus, contention arises.

Therefore, those who contend for cities will fill them with corpses, and those who contend for lands will leave the fields strewn with the dead. One must discern the root of contention and block its source—then all disputes will be resolved.

It is said: *The virtuous person does not contend.* Again it is said: *In what is ugly, there is no contention.* The lower scriptures state: *The Dao of the Sage is to act without contending.* What fault could there be in the virtue of non-contention?

**Peaceful-heartedness** means a heart undisturbed by desire. **Flexibility and completeness** means bending oneself to fulfill others. **Flowing like waves** means following nature’s course with ease. **Decay and slackness** means abandoning restraint without obstruction. The *Zhuangzi*’s ["应帝王"](https://ctext.org/zhuangzi-yao-yu-lu-ying-di-wang-pian) (Responding to the Emperor-King) says: *"Change and decay flow unrestrained; worldly affairs surge like waves—nothing ever remains the same."* **Submission and compliance** means surrendering the heart to follow the Dao.

Embrace these seven virtues and adhere to the three essential powers—this is the key to a tranquil state and longevity.

**Hold not to repletion, nor sharpen to excess** (Chapter 9)
---
**Commentary:** The previous chapter illuminated the Sage’s benevolent conduct, soft and weak yet free from fault. This chapter reveals the common man’s entanglement in emotions and arrogance, leading to inevitable blame.

First, it warns against **holding to repletion** and **sharpening to excess**, showing that such excesses are difficult to preserve.

Next, it cautions against the accumulation of wealth and riches, warning against the greed that follows.

Finally, it concludes with **naming virtue and withdrawing from ambition**, urging one to forget past gains and not cling to them.

**Meaning:** The previous chapter used water as an analogy to illustrate the practice of cultivation. Here, it begins with **holding to repletion** to further expose the folly of clinging and greed, seeking to guide one toward the Sage’s perfection through detachment and reflection.

**Holding to repletion** means to grasp and retain until fullness. If one does not cease, it will inevitably lead to loss. *(Note:)* To cling to fullness, fearing any imbalance or loss, only invites regret and stinginess. Thus, it is better to stop.

**Stop** means to cease. *(Commentary:)* **Hold** is to grasp. **Repletion** is fullness. **Stop** means to cease. The passage states that the human heart, when driven by insatiable desire, clings to accumulation and further seeks to fill itself. Such hoarding of wealth brings burden, and regret and stinginess will surely arise. Hence, the Sage’s admonition: *It is better to cease than to hold to repletion.*

**Meaning:** The analogy of **holding to repletion** has four implications:
1. Firmly clinging to desire until it overflows.
2. Retaining worldly wealth until it overflows.
3. Grasping onto evil deeds until they overflow.
4. Clinging to power and office until they overflow.

In general, those who know only to advance and forget to retreat, who do not reflect on the good Dao, who persist in their clinging without turning back—all such will face retribution. Those whose desires overflow will suffer from **debilitating illnesses** that harm their lives. Those who hoard worldly wealth will face **raids and plunder**, losing what they sought to guard. Those who indulge in evil deeds will meet **punishment, peril, and mutilation**. Those who cling to power and office will fall into **ruin and destruction**.

This is why the Laozi warns: *It is better to cease than to hold to repletion.* If one does not cease, retribution will surely follow.

**Sharpening to excess** cannot be long preserved. *(Note:)* **Sharpen** means to measure and refine, **excess** means to sharpen one’s ambitions. One who calculates and sharpens his desires for honor and wealth will soon lose them, inviting misfortune upon himself. Hence, such cannot be long preserved.

*(Commentary:)* **Sharpen** means to measure and assess. **Excess** means to refine and sharpen. When emotions stagnate and one greedily pursues honor and profit, he measures past actions and sharpens his desires—only to invite resentment from others and misfortune upon himself. Thus, such cannot be long preserved.

**Meaning:** When a king sharpens his ambition to expand territory and conquer lands, he invites the people’s resentment and the ruin of his state. When a subject sharpens his ambition for wealth and fame, he invites danger and calamity upon himself. Even if he temporarily succeeds, how could such gains last long? Moreover, advancing brings no benefit, while retreat invites worry and harm. Hence, it is said: *Such cannot be long preserved.*

**Gold and jade filling the halls** cannot be guarded. *(Note:)* This further clarifies that fullness cannot be long preserved.

*(Commentary:)* Suppose one’s greed never ceases, and he fills his halls with gold and jade. Yet even the elephant, though it has tusks, fears fire that consumes its body; the chicken, though it has feathers, dreads the knife that severs its tail. If one loses the treasure of non-greed and instead invites the worries of bandits and political rivals, how could he claim to guard his wealth? This reverses the earlier warning about **holding to repletion**.

**Meaning:** Suppose one claims to understand how to measure and refine his ambition, yet greedily seeks gold, jade, and rare treasures—filling his halls and enriching his house. He will inevitably face plunder and loss; how could he hope to preserve and guard them? Moreover, human life is limited, while desires are endless. If he cannot even save himself from death, how could he guard gold and jade? The elephant, though it has tusks, fears fire that burns its body—*(as recorded in the Spring and Autumn Annals, Shànggōng 24th Year:)* When the Jin lord Fǎn Xuānzǐ governed, the burdens of the feudal states grew heavy, and the Zheng people lamented them. In the second month, the Zheng lord visited Jin, and Zǐchǎn sent a letter to Zǐxī to convey to Xuānzǐ: *"You govern the Jin state, yet the neighboring feudal lords do not hear of your virtuous power but only of the heavy burdens you impose. I am perplexed by this.

I have heard that the virtuous person’s way to strengthen a state is not to fear the threat of bribes, but to fear the difficulty of a good reputation. When the feudal lords’ bribes gather in the royal halls, the feudal lords will turn away. If my lord relies on them, then the Jin state will falter. How could you, my lord, perish like this? Where would you use such bribes?"*

*(Note:)* **Falter** means to separate or divide. If the feudal lords turn away, the Jin state will collapse. If the Jin state falters, then my lord’s household will collapse. What use are these bribes? Where would you employ them?"»

「The virtuous reputation is the carriage of virtue. Virtue is the foundation of a state. If you do not destroy it, why would you engage in such matters?

When virtue is present, joy follows; joy allows one to endure. The *Shijing* says: *"Joyful only is the virtuous person, the foundation of a state."* Thus, virtue is indeed virtuous.

When one reflects with sincerity and acts with a virtuous reputation, even distant lands are at peace and the near are secure. Better to let men say of you, *"You truly nurtured me,"* than to let them say, *"You plundered me to sustain yourself."* (Plunder, here, refers to taking my wealth for your own survival.)

The image of a bird with teeth burning its own body is like bribes. Xuānzǐ was pleased and thus lightened the burdens.

This was the conduct that led the Duke of Zhèng to visit Jìn, for the sake of the heavy burdens.

The tale of the rooster cutting off its tail: During the Spring and Autumn period, King Jìng of Zhōu’s attendant, Fù Bīn Mèng Shì, saw a rooster cut off its own tail, and sighed: *"The purpose of a sacrificial offering lies in its completeness and plumpness. Now, by cutting off its tail, it makes itself incomplete, hoping to avoid being chosen as a sacrifice."* The rooster’s way of preserving itself is like this—how much more so for humans? To be greedy for profit while neglecting one’s own integrity is wisdom not even matched by a rooster’s.

The treasure of non-greed: There was a Zhèng man who found a jade and offered it to Zǐ Hǎn, saying: *"This is a treasure; I shall present it to you."* Zǐ Hǎn replied: *"You consider jade a treasure, but I consider non-greed a treasure. If I take the jade, both treasures will perish. Better to preserve both."*

The cause of calamity: The *Yijing*’s *Jiě* hexagram, line three, says: *"Bearing burdens and riding in carriages, it brings calamity."* (Bearing burdens refers to the actions of the petty man, who toils under heavy loads. Riding in carriages is the mark of the virtuous.) Now, if the petty man abandons his burdens and rides in a carriage, he is a petty man riding in the virtuous one’s vehicle. Thus, thieves and robbers are deprived of their gains.

(Here the original text is omitted: *"When the birds are exhausted, the fine bow is hidden; when the clever hare is dead, the hunting dogs are boiled—this is inevitable."* Fàn Lǐ escaped by boat and avoided disaster, while Wén Zhǒng clung to his position and lost his life. This is what is meant.)

At midday, the sun declines; when the moon is full, it wanes; summer gives way to winter, spring’s flourishing to autumn’s decay—this is the Dao of Heaven. If humans can align themselves with the fullness and emptiness of Heaven’s Dao, forgetting the pursuit of fame and success, then Zǐ Fáng would refuse food to wander freely, and Shū Guǎng would relinquish his seal to live in lofty dignity, thus avoiding the regrets of Upper Cài or Huàtíng’s plight.

How much more so for one who holds the supreme position, governs the myriad people, illuminates the ten thousand households, and encompasses the four seas—yet does not uphold the precept of moderation in fullness? The *Broad Explication of the Daoist Classic’s Supreme Meaning* concludes here. #1 *"至虚怀"* (likely *"至人虚怀"*—"The Perfect One’s humility"). #2 *"诸侯之弊重"* (*"弊"* here should be *"币"*—"tribute/gifts"—as in the *Zhuànzǐ*). #3 (The following text is omitted: see *Broad Explication of the Daoist Classic’s Supreme Meaning*, Volume Fourteen, for the full passage.) The *Broad Explication of the Daoist Classic’s Supreme Meaning* continues in Volume Eleven.»

**Excerpt from the *Broad Explication of the Daoist Classic’s Supreme Meaning* (唐廣成先生杜光庭述)
Chapter Ten: *Nurturing the Vital Essence and Embracing the One* (載營魄章第十)**

**Exegesis:**
The preceding chapter warns against indulgence and emotional excess, leading to calamity. This chapter expounds upon the cultivation of the spirit and preservation of *qi*, free from impurity, thus avoiding blemish. From *"Nurturing the Vital Essence"* to *"Purifying and Eliminating,"* it admonishes bodily cultivation to preserve *virtue/power*. From *"Loving the People"* to *"Illuminating Clarity,"* it demonstrates how perfecting *virtue/power* qualifies one to rule. The conclusion—*"Nurturing and Accumulating"*—illustrates the Dao’s profound influence upon all things.

**Meaning:**
This chapter elucidates the benefits of *Embracing the One*, contrasting it with the folly of prior excess. *Embracing the One* ensures the spirit’s integrity and the vital essence’s stability, while reckless ambition leads to inevitable ruin. It further reveals the subtleties of attaining supreme softness and profound insight, the principles of governing through benevolence, and the Dao’s universal function of nurturing and accumulating. How could one who *loads the vital essence* and *embraces the One* ever stray?

**Annotation:**
At birth, the nascent form is called *pò* (魄, "vital essence"). Once born, the *pò* becomes *hún* (魂, "spirit") when *yang* *qi* fills it. The *pò* is thus *yin* and void, while the *hún* is *yang* and replete. The text states that one must *nurture* this void *pò*, constantly replenishing it with *yang* *qi*—when the *yang* *qi* is full, it becomes the *hún*, and movement ensues, ensuring life’s completion. *One* here means *unadulterated*. To preserve life fully, one must guard this pure unity without corruption, lest it depart from the body.

**Exegesis:**
*Load* (載) refers to the initial state; *nurture* (營) means to protect. At birth, the form is but a void *pò*, yet once *yang* *qi* fills it, the *pò* becomes the *hún*—like moonlight reflecting sunlight to produce radiance. As the *Spring and Autumn Annals* records: *"At birth, the form is called *pò*; once born, the *pò* becomes *hún* when *yang* fills it."* Thus, one must *nurture* the *yang* *qi* within the void *pò*, ensuring its fullness so life may thrive. If *yang* *qi* dissipates through reckless action, the *pò* reverts to void, and death follows. Zhuangzi warns: *"Near death, do not let the *yang* revive."* Hence, one must *nurture* the void *pò* to restore *yang* and preserve life. *Embracing the One* without corruption ensures life’s completeness—this is the teaching on *nurturing the spirit*.

**Meaning:**
*Load* (載) signifies *carrying*, as the body is the vessel for spirit and *qi*, and the dwelling of *hún* and *pò*. Just as a carriage bears its load, the *Western Ascension Scripture* declares: *"The body is the spirit’s carriage."* Since the body is likened to a carriage, it must bear its load. The void *pò* is the *yin* manifestation of form, while *yang* *qi* is formless spirit. Without *yang* *qi*, the body is inert—like a lifeless stone or withered wood. Once *yang* descends, movement becomes possible, and the form is called *pò* (of *yin* nature). The *hún* (of *yang* nature) is the spirit.

So long as a thread of *yang* *qi* remains, death does not come; so long as a thread of *yin* *qi* remains, transcendence does not occur. Thus, refining *yin* *qi* to exhaustion grants ascent to the Nine Heavens as an immortal, aligning with *yang*. Exhausting *yang* *qi* plunges one into the Nine Abysses as a ghost, consorting with *yin*. Therefore, one must preserve the *yang* *hún* and nurture the *yin* *pò* to ensure life’s integrity. *Embracing the One* is *upholding the Dao*. To restrain the *hún* and govern the *pò* is to found oneself in the Dao—how could one who does so ever stray?

The *void likeness* (虛象) is the nascent form, its essence barely manifest. *Likeness* (象) means *resemblance*—like moonlight reflecting sunlight to produce light. The *Heavenly Primordium Scripture* states:
*"The moon is *yin* essence, possessing form but no light. The sun is the *yang* essence, perpetually traversing the Yellow Path eastward, advancing one degree daily—approximately 2,932 *li*. The moon is the *yin* essence, circular in form, pure in substance. It borrows the sun’s light to reveal its body; where the sun does not shine, it is called *pò*. It follows the Yellow Path eastward, sometimes veering beyond it, sometimes retreating within. Its pace varies: at its slowest, it traverses 12°19'2", averaging 13°37', and at its swiftest, 14°9'13". Slowness gives way to haste, haste to slowness, completing a cycle in 27 days and 52 minutes, while the sun takes 417 days. Thus, the extremes of haste and slowness conclude, and the cycle renews. Each month’s new moon aligns with the sun’s degree—*conjunction*. Since the moon moves faster than the sun, three days after conjunction, its light begins to emerge. On the first quarter, the sun illuminates its side, and observers see its flank—half-light, half-*pò*. At the dark moon, the sun faces its surface, while observers stand within—thus, the moon is unseen. On the full moon#1, the sun and moon face each other, with observers between them, revealing its full radiance—round and replete. When the moon is full in the morning, it appears in the east—*sidereal delay*, indicating slowness. When the moon wanes in the evening, it appears in the west—*gazing*, indicating haste."*

*The Heavenly Response* says:
*"Its light is void like the sun; when the sun’s light is not extreme, it is called *dark void*. When the *dark void* aligns with the moon, there is a lunar eclipse; with stars, their extinction."*

When the sun and moon traverse the central path during conjunction or opposition, they align with the *dark void* and suffer eclipse. The sun and moon each span three thousand *li* in circumference, with a diameter of one thousand *li*.

The *Spring and Autumn Annals* (昭公七年) records:
*"In the seventh year of Duke Zhao of Lu, Zheng’s ruler, Bo Hai, was assassinated by Si Dai. The people of Zheng were alarmed, saying, ‘Bo Hai has returned!’ Some dreamed of Bo Hai, who declared, ‘On the day *renzi*, I shall kill Dai.’ The next year, Duan was killed. Thus, on *renzi*, Si Dai died. The following year, Gongsun Duan died. The people of Zheng grew more fearful and asked Zi Chan, ‘Can Bo Hai still act as a ghost?’"*

Zi Chan replied:

*"When a person is born, their yin aspect is called the *po* (魄), and their yang aspect is called the *hun* (魂). When one’s vital essence (*wu* 物精) is abundant, then the *hun* and *po* grow strong. Even an ordinary man or woman, if they die violently, their *hun* and *po* may still cling to the living, causing mischief and calamity. How much more so for Bo Hai, who wielded power for three generations—his lingering as a ghostly force is entirely fitting!

Bo Hai was the son of Mu Gong’s retainer, the grandson of Zi Liang, and the father of Zi Er. Thus, it is said he ruled for three generations. Zi Chan had Zi Liang’s son, Zi Zhi, intercede on his behalf, and the matter was settled.

The idea that the dying should not be allowed to return to life is the sentiment expressed in the *Zhuangzi*’s [*Qixia* 齐物] chapter: ‘*Those who perish should not be revived*—this is where misfortune arises, and where dark schemes take root.’

This is akin to Nan Guo Zi Qi’s response to Zi You regarding the *Tianlai* (天籁).

*Chunyi* (淳一) refers to purity and harmony—unmixed, free from defilement and chaos, so as to remain undisturbed. Laozi illuminated this principle of *nurturing the po* (营魄) and *holding to the One* (守一) to teach people how to nourish their spirit.

The *Shangqing Yin Shu* (上清隐书) contains the methods of *Yuyi* (郁仪) chasing the sun and *Jielian* (结璘) chasing the moon. Within the sun and moon dwell five emperors each; by invoking their taboo names and visualizing their forms and attire, one may summon them to descend upon oneself, then consume the sun and moon’s essence. Those who master this method may live as long as the sun and moon.

It also teaches the *method of restraining the hun* (拘魂) and *controlling the po* (制魄). On the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third days of the lunar month, one should focus on the transformation of the crimson *qi* within the heart and invoke the names of the three *hun*: *Taiguang* (胎光), *Shuangling* (爽灵), and *Youjing* (幽精), then recite secret incantations to restrain them.

On the new moon, full moon, and last day of the lunar month, one should focus on the transformation of the white *qi* at the nose’s tip and invoke the names of the seven *po*: *Shigou* (尸狗), *Fushi* (伏矢), *Queyin* (雀阴), *Tunzei* (吞贼), *Chujie* (除秽), *Choufei* (臭肺), and *Feidu* (非毒), then recite secret incantations to control them. Each has its own meditative focus and incantations, detailed in the *Shangqing Pin* (上清品).

Practiced diligently over time, this allows one to achieve lightness of body. This is the supreme method of cultivating and protecting the ethereal *po*, transcending life and attaining longevity."*

「Focus the *qi* to attain softness—can you be as pure as an infant? *Annotation*: Concentrate the harmonious *qi* to achieve gentleness, and you shall be like the infant *hun* without any division or attachment.

*Commentary*: *专 (zhuān)* means singular focus; *冲气 (chōng qì)* refers to the harmonious and wondrous *qi*. The foundation of human life lies in this harmonious *qi*. If one is stained by the profane realm of dust and desire, the *qi* scatters, and the spirit fails to anchor the body. Thus, the precept commands singular focus on the harmonious *qi*, cultivating softness and weakness, so that one may be like an infant—unattached to all things. This is the teaching of nourishing the *qi*.

*Meaning*: An infant knows nothing, yet responds instinctively to stimuli. It fully submits to the harmonious *qi*, untouched by external defilements or internal deliberations. Its natural softness and weakness allow the *qi* to remain undisturbed. The adept of the Dao must emulate this infantile purity—free from attachment and deliberation—so that the spirit does not abandon the body.

The *Xisheng Jing* (西升经) states:
*"To grieve for others is not as good as to grieve for oneself; to grieve for oneself is not as good as to love the spirit; to love the spirit is not as good as to contain the spirit; to contain the spirit is not as good as to guard the True. Guarding the True ensures enduring longevity."*

Again, it says:
*"The spirit gives life, the heart takes it away. Thus, the precept commands restraint of will and thought, and distance from deliberation—that is the teaching of refining the heart."*

Can you purify the *Xuanlan* (玄览) and be without blemish? *Annotation*: *Xuanlan* refers to the heart’s illumination; *blemish (cī)* means flaw or affliction. Can you cleanse the heart’s illumination, making it serene and pure, without any flaw or affliction?

*Commentary*: *涤 (dí)* means to wash; *除 (chú)* means to discipline. *Xuanlan* is the heart’s illumination; *blemish (cī)* is affliction. When one’s heart is clouded by desire, it falls into defilement. The precept requires washing and disciplining the heart’s illumination, ensuring its purity and stillness, so that desire does not arise. Can you attain this flawless state? This is the teaching of refining the heart.

*Meaning*: The heart’s illumination penetrates all existence—past and present, heaven and earth. It responds to circumstances and moves with the world. If not controlled by clarity and tranquility, it succumbs to desire, and from desire, all evils arise. When evils take root, blemishes manifest. The precept commands washing and disciplining, severing desire so that the heart’s illumination remains pure and without blemish. The *Xisheng Jing* states:
*"The spirit that begets me, the heart that slays me."* Thus, the adept must restrain will and thought, distancing themselves from deliberation—that is the teaching of refining the heart.

Can you govern the people and the state with *wuwei* (無為)? *Annotation*: To nurture all people and administer state affairs—can you act without *wuwei*? You must embody transformation yourself. All teachings above instruct the cultivation of the self; when the self is refined, virtue is complete, and thus one may rule as sovereign.

*Commentary*: To govern the people means to prevent their sudden harm or exhaustion, and to labor them without damaging their nature. To administer the state means to prioritize agriculture and value grain, to simplify governance and avoid excess, so that the people find peace in their lives and are transformed without words. This is *wuwei*. Can you achieve it?

*Meaning*: The people are the foundation of the state. *Wuwei* is the Dao’s transformation—using the Dao’s transformation to nurture the people secures the state’s foundation. Harsh governance and excessive demands are violence. Heavy taxation and burdensome labor damage their nature. If not done in season, it disrupts agriculture. If frugality is not practiced, grain becomes undervalued. This is the teaching of governing the state.

The sovereign’s essence is rooted in the Dao and grounded in virtue. Without the Dao and virtue, how can one rule? This is the essence of the precept on governing the state.

Can you open and close the *Tianmen* (天門) like the receptive (雌)? *Annotation*: *Tianmen* is the source of imperial mandate. *开阖 (kāi hé)* refers to its order or chaos. When a sovereign is duly appointed by fate and receives the mandate, can they embody receptive softness and guard stillness, thus enduring the celestial blessings of their reign?

Another interpretation: The *Book of Changes* says, *"One opening and one closing is called transformation."* The sage governs by responding to changes without rigidity, not clinging to masculine force but instead embracing the receptive. So too with the *Tianmen*—when it opens and closes, it wanes and waxes, increasing in humility.

*Commentary*: Cultivating virtue allows one to rule. To rule, one must accept the imperial mandate, which emerges from the *Tianmen*—the source of the emperor’s fate. *开 (kāi)* means receiving the mandate; *阖 (hé)* means being deposed. Heaven bestows blessings upon the virtuous, and if they guard receptive softness, they may enjoy great fortune. Thus, it is asked: Can you embody receptivity?

*Meaning*: Even as one practices nurturing the people and governing the state to become a sovereign, they must still humble themselves and follow Heaven, aligning with the imperial mandate. The mandate refers to the appointed fate and the cycles of the Five Phases (五運). Shun commanded Yu: *"The mandate of Heaven lies in your person."* Enduring celestial blessings means accepting the mandate and fulfilling Heaven’s will, thus receiving its great favor—this is called *bao ming* (寶命, precious mandate). It is granted by Heaven itself.

The *Book of Changes* (《易□系》) states: *"The greatest treasure of the sage is called Position."* When the *Tianmen* opens, Heaven sends extraordinary omens—such as the Yellow Star moving with color, the Red Comet displaying auspicious signs, the Purple Vapor filling the court, the Five Stars converging at the Well, the Rainbow flowing through the Moon, or lightning circling the pivot. Then, the mountains yield their minerals, rivers bring forth their jewels, stars appear to announce the birth of worthy ministers, and celestial symbols manifest to assist and protect. Thus, the sovereign responds to Heaven and governs the people, rescues the living, and eliminates calamities, all while accepting the mandate to rule under Heaven.

But when governance falters, laws become misaligned, the people rebel, and kin betray, war erupts, and chaos spreads from below while celestial signs appear above—such as the sun’s mandate failing, mountains collapsing, and rivers drying up—disasters swarm, and the state perishes. This is the *Tianmen* closing.

*"One opening and one closing is called transformation"*—the *Book of Changes* (《易□系辞》) explains this as the cyclical interplay of opening and closing, the alternation of yin and yang, and the principle of *yifu* (倚伏, leaning and resting). When waning and waxing, humility increases—like the sun at its zenith beginning to decline, or the moon at fullness starting to wane. Its fullness is extinguished, and humility brings benefit—this is the dynamic of leaning and resting.

「The Venerable Lord admonishes: When a ruler has received the mandate and governs the people, he must practice the *feminine* (雌) stillness, gentleness, and effortlessness—administering a pure and simple governance that harmonizes with the natural order of Heaven. Thus, he tends to all under the heavens.

Again, the *Book of Changes* (《易□系》) states that *closing the door* (阖户) is called *Kūn* (坤). *Kūn* is yin. *Closing* (阖) means *concealment* (闭藏). All things first conceal themselves before emerging, just as a room’s door is opened and closed. Thus, it is called *closing the door* (阖户).

*Opening the door* (辟户) is called *Qián* (乾). *Qián* is yang. *Opening* (辟) means *to bring forth life* (吐生). In yang, it expands—Heaven can bring forth all things, like a room’s door being opened to reveal its space. It is also interpreted as *closing* (阖) being *darkness* (暗昧) and *opening* (辟) being *clarity* (昭明).

The Way cannot be achieved through *masculine* force—*Zhuāngzi* (《庄子□大宗师》) says, *"Do not resist the few, nor rely on masculine force"* (不逆寡、不雄成), meaning do not depend on one’s achievements, but instead act in accordance with the Way’s natural unfolding. One must preserve *feminine* stillness to transform.

To be *clear and far-reaching* (明白四达), can one truly *not know* (无知)? *Note*: If a ruler can embrace *feminine* stillness, the people will joyfully follow. Though his virtue may shine as brightly as the sun illuminating all four directions, he must still *forget his merit* (忘功) and *not claim dominion* (不宰), hence the saying, *"Can one truly not know?"*

*Explanation*: When an emperor has received the celestial mandate (历数) and governs all under the heavens, if he can uphold *feminine* stillness, his virtue will be clear like the sun’s radiance, reaching all four directions of the world. His merits will extend to all things without his claiming them, which is the *"forgetting of merit as if one did not know"* (忘功若无知). Thus, it is said, *"Can one truly not know?"*

*Meaning*: *Clear* (明白) is *benevolent illumination* (惠照). The heart of benevolent illumination knows no distance—it shines forth in all directions, unobstructed. If one’s illumination is thus, he must *restrain his thoughts and forget his mind* (息念忘心), not cling to perception, as though he were *without knowing* (无知). If one boasts of his knowing, he will become attached and lose the Dao.

When a ruler governs the four seas with his singular insight, his governance becomes *overbearing* (察察), and the people wither and suffer. The Venerable Lord warns against this, saying that *forgetting merit and resting in illumination* (忘功息照) is akin to *plugging one’s ears with coarse cloth* (黈纩塞耳) to close one’s hearing, or *wearing a cap with drooping pendants* (冕旒垂目) to obscure one’s vision.

*Nurturing life and fostering growth* (生之畜之).

*Explanation*: The lower text says, *"The Dao brings forth life, virtue fosters growth"* (道生之，德畜之). Here, *"nurturing life and fostering growth"* (生之畜之) means that a ruler follows the Dao’s *clear and still* (清静) principle, allowing things to fulfill their natural growth and formation. He embodies virtue to aid and nourish, ensuring all things reach their full potential of *fostering and growth* (畜养). Thus, it is said, *"nurturing life and fostering growth"* (生之畜之).

*Meaning*: The Dao *brings forth life* (生) for all things, hence *"nurturing life"* (生之); virtue *fosters growth* (畜) for all things, hence *"fostering growth"* (畜之). The emperor follows the Dao and embodies virtue, entrusting things to their natural growth and fostering, each according to their place and nature, all finding what suits them. Thus, nothing is left without its proper place.

*Law* (法) means *principle* (则); *effect* (效) means *to emulate* (学). *Bringing forth without possession, acting without reliance, leading without dominion*—this is called the *Mysterious Virtue* (玄德).

*Note*: Allowing things to fulfill their natural growth and fostering them, the Sage *forgets his efforts* (忘功), so that their natural growth is sufficient in itself, and forgetting his efforts ensures his actions are perpetually complete. This is *"without private intent yet achieving private intent, without dominion yet being the dominion"* (无私而成私，不宰而为宰). Hence, *"bringing forth without possession"* (生而不有) means allowing things to fulfill their natural growth, yet the ruler does not claim them as his own. *"Acting without reliance"* (为而不恃) means allowing things to act naturally, yet the ruler does not boast of their achievements as his own merit. *"Leading without dominion"* (长而不宰) means being above all people, hence *"leading"* (长), and yet *not claiming dominion* (不宰) over their merits.

If a ruler can thus act, this is called the *deep Mysterious Virtue* (深玄之德).

*Explanation*: Things fulfill their natural growth, while the Sage *forgets his efforts* (忘功). Their natural growth suffices in itself, and forgetting his efforts ensures his actions are perpetually complete. This is the *"without private intent yet achieving private intent, without dominion yet being the dominion"* (无私而成私，不宰而为宰).

Thus, *"bringing forth without possession"* (生而不有) means allowing things to fulfill their natural growth, yet the ruler does not claim them as his own. *"Acting without reliance"* (为而不恃) means allowing things to act naturally, yet the ruler does not boast of their achievements as his own merit. *"Leading without dominion"* (长而不宰) means being above all people, hence *"leading"* (长), and yet *not claiming dominion* (不宰) over their merits. Such is the *deep Mysterious Virtue* (深玄之德).

*Meaning*: The ruler upholds the *pure and unified* (淳一), cleanses his heart and illuminates inwardly, loves the people and governs the state, acts in accordance with Heaven’s rhythms and the Dao’s principles, embodies *feminine* stillness and balance, restrains his vision and hearing. He follows the Dao to bring forth life, aligns with virtue to nurture the people, bringing forth life yet *not possessing its merit* (不有其功), governing yet *not relying on his strength* (不恃其力), his vision and hearing reaching in all directions, yet *not dwelling on his achievements* (功成不居).

This is the principle of *governing the state through love and fostering life within oneself*, the virtue that aligns with Heaven’s Way. *Mysterious* (玄) is Heaven (天).

*Chapter Thirty of the Spokes, Chapter Eleven* (三十辐章第十一).

*Explanation*: The previous chapter elucidates that *nurturing the spirit and loving the qi* (爱气养神) leads to *purity without admixture* (不杂), hence *no blemish* (无疵). This chapter explains that *utilizing without excess* (利有用无) relies on mutual support to establish function, hence *Qián* and *Kūn* become the *great* (大) *accumulations* (韫) of the *Book of Changes*, and the *axle and wheels* (辕厢) are complete, embodying the principle of *utilizing without excess*.

The *cart, tools, and room* (车器室) are used as metaphors to illustrate the structure of *utilizing without excess* (利用). The three—*cart, tools, and room*—all rely on their *external form* (外有) to achieve their *internal function* (中无), thus fulfilling their purpose.

*Qián* and *Kūn* are the *great accumulations* (大易之韫) of the *Book of Changes*—the words of the *Appended Commentaries* (《易□击》). They are the foundation upon which the *Book of Changes* is established. Without *Qián* and *Kūn*, there would be no origin for the Dao of the *Book of Changes*. Thus, *Qián* and *Kūn* are the *root source* (根源) of the *Book of Changes*’s accumulations, its *state treasury and hidden storehouse* (州府奥藏). Hence, the following text says, *"When Qián and Kūn are arranged in order, the Book of Changes is established within them"* (乾坤成列而易立乎其中矣). If *Qián* and *Kūn* are destroyed, the *Book of Changes* cannot be seen.

Just as *wheels and axles* (轮毂) and *axle and cart body* (辕厢) are the essential components of a cart, if the *axle and cart body* are destroyed, the cart cannot be seen. This illustrates the *foundation of utilizing without excess* (利用之因). The *principle of governing the state* (理国) is that *the people exist, the state exists* (民存则有国); *the people scatter, the state is in peril* (民散则国危). The *principle of governing oneself* (理身) is that *the spirit exists, life exists* (神存则有生); *the spirit departs, the body perishes* (神逝则身灭). The Dao of *utilizing without excess* truly relies on mutual support.

*Thirty spokes share one hub* (三十辐共一毂). When the hub is *without* (无), the cart’s *use* (用) is complete. *Note*: This illustrates *how the presence and absence of things establish their function* (有无功用), relying on mutual support to stand.

*Thirty spokes* (三十辐) clarify that *thirty spokes are united under one hub* (共一毂), hence the saying, *"Few govern many"* (少总众). The *axle and cart body* (辕厢) must rely on their *external form* (共则) to become a cart, and the *cart’s emptiness* (车中空无) enables its *movement and use* (运用).」

「If there were no axle and cart body, there would be no cart for use. If the cart’s interior were not empty, then the axle and cart body would be nothing but discarded materials.

**Commentary:** The thirty spokes converge upon one hub, illustrating how the few govern the many. When it is empty, only then does the cart’s function unfold—demonstrating how the void benefits the presence.

**Meaning:** The hub gathers the spokes to form a wheel; the cart gathers diverse materials to fulfill its purpose. What is truly utilized is the cart’s emptiness within. Without the wheel and hub, a cart could not exist; yet once formed, its hollow center enables transport. This illustrates how a sovereign relies on inner counsel from ministers and outer aid from feudal lords to establish a state—just as the thirty spokes converge upon a single hub.

Once a state is established, if one cultivates an empty heart in harmony with the Dao, the world transforms naturally, like the cart’s hollow space. The human body, too, depends on external limbs and internal harmony of the five *qi*, like spokes converging to form a person. Once the body is complete, if one cultivates an empty heart in harmony with the Dao, the primordial unity operates subtly, achieving longevity.

This clarifies how presence and absence mutually benefit their utility.

**Commentary:** What is the Dao? It is the ultimate void and ultimate oneness. Thus, it can agitate all classes, mobilize diverse materials, and adapt to myriad distinctions, yet all is shaped by this singular manifestation.

**Meaning:** The Dao’s true oneness is formless and soundless. All classes and materials rely upon it to stand. The *dynamic* includes the five spirits—hair, feathers, scales, shells, and insects—while the *static* encompasses grasses and trees. *Classes* refer to their forms; *materials* to their substance. Though movement and growth vary infinitely, their sustenance and formation stem from the Dao—this singular manifestation.

The *Classic* states: *"In hazy indistinctness, there lies a form"*—this is the pure, primordial essence that generates all distinctions. It may be called the few governing the many.

**Commentary:** All orifices resonate together, yet they are stirred by a single sound. The origin of all movement and function, the source of all generation, never departs from the ultimate void and oneness.

**Meaning:** The *orifices*—as South Gate Ziqi told Zigong in the *Zhuangzi’s* ["Amidst Diversity"]: *"The Great Clod exhales breath, and its name is wind. Without action, it acts; when it acts, all orifices roar."* A great tree’s hollows—like nostrils, mouths, ears, and fissures—emit sounds: some bellow, some whistle, some shout, some inhale, some wail. Cool winds harmonize subtly; gusting winds harmonize grandly. Yet though the sounds vary infinitely, they are all stirred by one wind alone.

Observing the world’s movements, the *Yijing’s* ["Appended Transmissions"] says: *"The sage perceives the world’s transformations,"* meaning the sage’s subtle insight reveals how all things move and generate, all deriving from the pure, singular Dao. Thus, it is said they never depart from the ultimate void and oneness.

**Commentary:** Even in the cart’s case, the axle and body have substance. Yet the cart’s emptiness enables its use—if the axle and body did not exist, the void’s function would vanish. If the interior were not empty, the axle and body would be useless.

Thus, when *Qian* and *Kun* are complete, the *Yijing’s* efficacy is realized.

**Meaning:** This expounds how *Qian* and *Kun* complete the *Yijing’s* foundation, just as the axle and body establish the cart’s emptiness.

**Commentary:** As transformations flow universally, the Dao’s function becomes manifest. Thus, through crude analogies of utility and void, the supreme void’s benefit is revealed.

**Meaning:** All transformations derive from the Dao’s function. Without them, the Dao’s efficacy would not be evident—just as the axle and body serve the cart, or *Qian* and *Kun* fulfill the *Yijing’s* purpose. The cart is a common tool, visible to all. Using it as an analogy to illustrate the subtle Dao, it is called a crude metaphor.

Molding clay into vessels, when it is empty, the vessel’s use emerges.
**Note:** *Cén* means "to blend"; *zhì* means "clay." Potters blend clay to create jars and pots, utilizing their emptiness to hold things.

**Commentary:** *Cén* means "to blend"; *zhì* means "adhesive clay." The note refers to potters—*The Book of Documents* says, *"Shaping clay is called pottery."* Here, potters blend and shape clay, firing it into vessels, taking advantage of their hollow interiors to contain objects.

**Meaning:** Blending clay into vessels further demonstrates how presence enables the use of void. All vessels, though varying in size, shape, craftsmanship, or value, derive their function from their emptiness within.

*"Shaping clay is called pottery"* is a phrase from *The Book of Documents*. During Shun’s humble days, he tilled fields on Mount Li and practiced pottery by the riverbank. *The Record of the Transcendent* states: *"The Potter and his disciples—ancient artisans skilled in refining the five colors of fire—ascended to heaven."*

Carving doors and windows to make a dwelling, when it is empty, the dwelling’s use emerges.
**Note:** Ancient dwellers carved caves as homes, also opening doors and windows—hence "carving."

**Commentary:** *Carving* means "to pierce." Windows beside doors are called *yǒu*. Ancient people lived in caves, so the *Odes* say, *"Carving and recarving caves,"* meaning they dug into the earth to cover their dwellings, hence "carving." Later sages replaced them with palaces, utilizing their empty interiors for habitation. *Zhuangzi* says: *"If a room has no emptiness, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law will clash over paths."* *The Er Ya* calls palaces *"rooms."*

**Meaning:** The *Mao Odes’* ["File of King Wen"] ["Soft and Gentle"] says: *"Ancestor Ji of Zhou, carving and recarving caves, had not yet built homes."*

The ancient ruler **Ancestor Ji** (古公) was **Lord Ji of Zou** (邠公). The term *古* (Ancestor) signifies *long-standing* (久). *亶父* (Ji) was his personal name, and he was the progenitor of **King Wen** (文王). Dwelling in **Zou** (邠), he cultivated the people through his **virtue** (德), and many flocked to him.

The **Rong people** (狄人) invaded him, and when he offered them **deer hides and ritual jade** (皮币), they would not be appeased. When he offered them **dogs and horses** (犬马), they would not be appeased. When he offered them **pearls and jade** (珠玉), they would not be appeased. Thus, he summoned his elders and said: *"The Rong people desire my land. I have heard that a gentleman does not harm others with what he uses to nourish them. My noble sons, what fear is there of lacking a lord?"* He then took his staff and departed, crossing **Liang Mountain** (梁山) to settle beneath **Qi Mountain** (岐山).

The people of Zou said: *"A virtuous man cannot be forsaken."* They followed him as if returning from the market. At first, they had no dwellings, so they **molded the earth and covered it** (陶其土而复之), **dug into the earth and made caves** (陶其壤而穴之). When father and son, husband and wife lived together, it was called a **family** (家). They had not yet built **bedchambers and ancestral temples** (寝庙), nor had they established **family dwellings** (家室).

**Annotation:** The ministers of feudal lords addressed them as *君* (lord). *复* (covering) refers to covering the earth above. *穴* (cave) means digging into the earth. All were done in the manner of *陶* (molding), which is akin to modern **pottery kilns** (瓦窑). This describes their early endeavors in Zou, a name of the land granted to them.

*The Book of Changes* **Appendix** (《易□系》) states: *"In the upper antiquity, people lived in caves and dwelt in the wild. Later sages replaced this with palaces."* It draws from *"Great Vigorousness"* (《大壮》), where the creation of palaces was modeled after the primitive **cave-dwelling and wild habitation** (穴居野处). The *Changes* refers to the upper antiquity, meaning before the construction of dwellings, when people merely **nested in trees in summer and dug caves in winter** (夏巢冬穴). The *Zhuangzi* ["Thieves and Dike"] (《盗跖》) says: *"The people of upper antiquity nested in trees during summer and gathered twigs and chestnuts in winter."* Within these nests and caves, they took the **emptiness** (空) for habitation. Today’s palaces are also built to utilize their **interior voids** (空), hence the saying: *"When there is no emptiness, the dwelling’s use emerges"* (当其无，有室之用).

*"Mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law clashing over paths"* (妇姑勃蹊) means *路径* (pathway); *勃* (clashing) implies **anger and contention** (戾怒). As in the *Zhuangzi* ["External Objects"] (《外物篇》), when a dwelling is not spacious, pathways become **narrow and cramped** (湫隘), causing mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law to **quarrel over passage** (争路而行). Normally, a daughter-in-law should yield to her mother-in-law as a mark of **filial piety and respect** (孝敬), but now they contend in anger—this is because the dwelling is **too confined** (隘狭), lacking privacy for their movements, leading to **mutual resentment and strife** (反戾而斗争).

This means: *"When a dwelling is confined and lacks emptiness, mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law quarrel over paths."* When the **heart is obstructed and not open** (心壅蔽不虚), **desires intrude upon one another** (嗜欲交侵). *The Er Ya* says: *"Palaces are called rooms, rooms are called palaces."* The distinction lies in their **size and structure** (大小异制).

Today, **rites have diminished** (礼有降杀), and what the sage dwells in is called a **palace** (宫), while what the common people dwell in is called **family residences, houses, chambers, and halls** (家宅屋宇堂室等). In the *Analects* (《论语》), **Royal Kang’s annotation** (皇侃疏) explains: *"Within the hall, partitions divide it into inner and outer spaces, forming separate rooms and chambers."* Thus, *堂* (hall) is a general term, while *室* (chamber) is a specific division within it. Hence, *"Having it is for advantage, lacking it is for utility"* (有之以为利，无之以为用).

**Annotation:** *Having* (有) refers to the **advantage of physical form** (体), while *lacking* (无) refers to the **utility of emptiness** (无). The *Commentary* states: *"The advantage of having is derived from the utility of lacking; the utility of lacking is derived from the advantage of having."* Moreover, what is **formless and transcendent** (形而上者) is called **Dao/Way** (道), while what is **formed and tangible** (形而下者) is called **instrument/artifact** (器). To illustrate the **application of the supreme Dao** (至道), it is constrained by form and substance to reveal its efficacy, hence the use of the coarse advantage of having and the subtle utility of lacking.

**Annotation:** The advantage of having is useful for **application** (用), and application must rely on lacking, so having is advantageous because of lacking. The utility of lacking is applied to **substance** (体), and substance must rely on having, so lacking is useful because of having.

**Meaning:** The **Dao’s lack of form** (无) relies on having to manifest its **function** (功). Without this having, the Dao’s function would not be revealed. The **existence of things** (有) relies on the Dao to receive their **nature and form** (质). Without this Dao, things would not arise.

Things cannot arise and complete without the Dao, and the Dao cannot display its **function and utility** (功用) without things. This is like **vehicles, dwellings, and tools** (车器室三者), all of which utilize **emptiness for advantage** (因无以利有) and **having for utility** (因有以用无).

**Annotation:** The *Commentary* states: *"What is formless and transcendent is called Dao, what is formed and tangible is called instrument"* (形而上者曰道，形而下者曰器), which is the text from *The Book of Changes* **Appendix** (《易□系辞》). **Meaning:** What is formless and transcendent is the **origin of the Dao** (道之本), **pure and effortless** (清虚无为), hence it is said to dwell above. What is formed and tangible is the **application of the Dao** (道之用), receiving nature and flowing into form, hence it is said to dwell below. To **manifest the Dao’s application** (显道之用), it appears through things, and since things possess **substance and form** (有质), they are called instruments. Instruments are the **category of what has form** (有形之类).

The sages followed the Dao’s application, shaping it into instruments. They **inscribed trigrams and contemplated symbols** to create **writing** (文字), **carved wood into boats** (舟), **sculpted wood into pestles** (檝), **cut wood into grinding tools** (杵), **dug earth for mortars** (臼), **wove wood into bows** (弧), **sharpened wood into arrows** (矢), **constructed official buildings** (官室), **wove nets for hunting** (网罟), **rode horses and used oxen** (服牛乘马), **carried burdens and traveled far** (负重致远), **cast metal into weapons** (兵), **erected poles as flags** (旗), **hewed wood into plows** (耜), and **wove wooden plowshares** (耒). Each of these, **one or more**, serves to **benefit the world** (利天下).

All these are divisions of the Dao’s application as instruments. The Dao is the **name of the formless** (无体之名), and form is the **application of the tangible** (有质之用). All **ten thousand things** arise from **lacking and take form** (无而生), and all forms are established by the Dao (道而立). First the Dao, then form; the Dao is above form, and form is below the Dao.

Thus, what is **formless and transcendent** is called Dao, and what is **formed and tangible** is called instrument. Though form lies between Dao and instrument, it is **form above instrument, not Dao**. Since form possesses **substance and utility** (有质), it is called instrument.

The Dao is **lacking** (无), while form is **having** (有). Having has its **limit** (极), but lacking endures **eternally** (长存).

The world’s people, in cultivating the Dao, must externally fortify their form to treasure what is **having**, and internally preserve their spirit to revere what is **lacking**. Gradually attaining the wondrous **lacking**, they align with the Dao and may thereby achieve longevity.

**Commentary:** From **lacking**, it is called Dao; when touching **having**, it is called instrument. To clarify the Dao’s application, one further elucidates through form and instrument. Though employing three metaphors, ultimately, it all converges in the **lacking**.

**Meaning:** The utmost **oneness** and **lacking**—this is the Dao. Having symbols and forms—this is the instrument. By approximating the instrument, the Dao is made clear, and again, through metaphors of chariots, dwellings, and the like—these are the three metaphors. Their application in the **lacking** is all uniformly aligned.

The Sage’s governance of the world involves suspending rewards and punishments, establishing laws and measures, issuing decrees and instructions, and clarifying distinctions between superiors and inferiors—all these are **having**. Yet if one governs in **lacking** silence, with boundless stillness guiding the people, without speaking yet transforming them, all things naturally order themselves. Though rewards and punishments, institutions, decrees, and hierarchical distinctions exist, if they are not employed, it may still be said that one uses **having** as a pretense while applying **lacking**. This is the ultimate principle.

In cultivating the self, one follows the Classics to awaken to principle, then forgets the words upon enlightenment, penetrating the subtle gate, not clinging to doctrine—is this not the same meaning?

---
**End of Volume Twelve of *The Broad Explication of the True and Authentic Dao-De Jing* by the Sage, Master Guangcheng of Tang, Du Guangting’s Account**

**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors Blind the Eyes**

**Explication:**
The previous chapter expounds that profit has both utility and harm, and thus merit arises from their interplay. This chapter warns that indulgence in sensory pleasures leads to delusion, and unrestrained pursuit of desires brings ruin. It begins by marking colors, sounds, and flavors as temptations to be guarded against, for their excess harms one’s nature. Next, it states that hunting and hoarding wealth for greed are even more destructive, as they consume harmony to fuel passion. Finally, it concludes with the Sage’s guidance on discernment—revealing the essential principle for preserving true integrity and safeguarding life.

**Meaning:**
The previous chapter clarified that profit has both utility and harm; this chapter cautions against excessive indulgence. Colors and sounds nourish the ears and eyes, but overindulgence leads to blindness and deafness. Flavors sustain the body, but excess brings sickness. What then of reckless pursuit and greed for wealth? Their harm surpasses that of the three senses, yet they cannot be abandoned—this is the height of delusion.

The Master Laozi discerns this, urging restraint from within and moderation in outward actions as the core principle for governing both state and self.

The five colors blind the eyes, the five tones deaf the ears, and the five flavors dull the palate.
**Annotation:** The eyes delight in the sight of blue and yellow hues, the ears are captivated by the five musical tones, and the mouth relishes the flavors of grains and livestock. When indulgence exceeds proper measure, it causes the body to lose its senses—blindness, deafness, and loss of taste.

**Meaning:**
The five tones, as explained by Han scholar Liu Xiang: *Gong* is central harmony, the virtue of the sovereign. *Shang* is rhythm, the completion of things. *Jiao* is the initial note, the emergence of life. *Zhi* is prosperity, the flourishing and abundance of existence. *Yu* is convergence, where things gather and conceal themselves. The five colors, as noted by Master Wang Shushi: When silk is refined, if indigo is added, it becomes blue; if cinnabar is added, it becomes red; if turmeric is added, it becomes yellow; if gallnut is added, it becomes black—thus forming the five colors.

If the eyes cannot perceive the five colors, it is called *blindness*. The five colors were established to display the symbols of the Five Phases and distinguish the adornments of rank. Yet to dwell upon them is not blindness alone?

If the ears cannot hear the five tones, it is called *deafness*. The five tones were created to harmonize Heaven and Earth and manifest the sounds of the Five Phases. To revel in them without restraint is not deafness?

If the mouth cannot discern the five flavors, it is called *dullness* (or loss of taste). The five flavors were set to demonstrate the harmony of the Five Phases and nourish humanity. To indulge excessively is not dullness?

Maopin’s *Shi Wei* states: When the five tones are perfected, the music of Zheng and Wei arises; when the five colors are perfected, embroidered patterns and fine fabrics emerge. Excessive indulgence leads to internal ailments; lingering fixation breeds external corruption of virtue. Though no harm comes to sight or hearing, and no deprivation to eating or drinking, their stagnation is as destructive as sickness itself.

The *Yi Jing* (Book of Changes) states in the *Yi* hexagram: *"Caution in speech, moderation in eating and drinking—this too is a warning."* The *Chunqiu* (Spring and Autumn Annals) recounts Fu Chen’s remonstrance to King Xiang of Zhou: *"Ears unable to hear the harmonious five tones become deaf; eyes unable to distinguish the five colors become dim (or blind)."* If one is fixated in a single perspective, the people will stagnate and discord will arise. If one’s *qi* is obstructed and thinned, illness will take root. Such restraint is most prudent.

**Explication:** Moreover, if one is ensnared by the transient pleasures of colors, sounds, and flavors—unaware that these senses are inherently empty—it is not merely the body that suffers blindness and deafness, but the mind itself, veiled in ignorance.

**Meaning:**
When the eyes are captivated by alluring hues, the ears entranced by Zheng and Wei music, and the mouth craving delicacies, the heart becomes clogged and unyielding, drifting into forgetfulness with no return. At its worst, one forgets the order of Heaven and Earth and the four seasons; at its next degree, one violates the proper distinctions of rank and the rituals of music and joy; at its least, one invites calamity through strife and contention. For both state and family, such indulgence means the loss of principle.

From ancient times to the present, many have perished in their families and states because of colors and sounds. It is not only the licentiousness of the last Xia’s Daji or the last Shang’s Li Ji that has led to ruin. Even the flavors of food have sparked conflict—such as the disaster of the *Yangang* (sheep’s head soup) and the *Jieyuan* (turtle’s meat) feast.

In the *Chunqiu* (Spring and Autumn Annals), during the second year of Duke Huan of Lu’s reign, the Duke of Chu commanded the son of the Duke of Zheng, Gongzi Gui, to attack the state of Song. Song’s Hua Yuan, delighted by the music of the state of Ju, led his troops to resist. On the second month, the day *Renzhi*, they clashed at Da Ji. Before the battle, Hua Yuan slaughtered sheep to feed his soldiers.

The *Yangang* (sheep’s head soup) was not offered to Hua Yuan. Upon the battle, he declared: *"The sheep of yesterday were under your command, but today’s affair is under mine."* He then entered the fray with the Zheng troops, and thus the Song forces suffered a great defeat.

The Zheng people captured Hua Yuan, seized the Ju musician and four hundred sixty war chariots, took two hundred fifty prisoners, and cut off the noses of a hundred men. The state of Song redeemed Hua Yuan from Zheng with one hundred war chariots and one hundred fine steeds.

When half of the Song forces had entered Zheng territory, Hua Yuan fled and returned. He stood outside the city gates, announced his arrival, and then entered. Upon seeing the Ju musician, he said: *"Your steeds were in fine form."* The musician replied: *"They were not steeds, but men."* After this exchange, the Duke of Song’s younger brother, **Chu Jian** (叔牂), fled to Lu. Chu Jian was the musician’s given name.

The *Junzi* (noble ones) said that the Ju musician was not a true man, for he let private resentment bring ruin to his state and slaughter its people—what greater crime could there be? This is the *"Small Odes"* passage that says: *"Those without virtue, is it not the Ju musician they speak of?"* He slaughtered the people to satisfy his own grudge.

The *Jieyuan* (turtle’s meat) incident occurred in the fourth year of Duke Xuan’s reign (宣公四年), when the Chu people presented a turtle to Duke Ling of Zheng. The eldest son of Duke Mu of Wei, **Prince Yi** (夷也), was surnamed **Zi Gong** (子公) and **Gongzi Gui** (公子归生).

The *Junzi* (noble ones) said that the **Prince Yi** (夷也) saw **Zi Gong** (子公) before entering. **Zi Gong’s** second finger twitched—his food-finger. He showed this to **Zi Jia** (子家) and said, *"If one day I act like this, you must taste something strange."*

When he entered, the cook was about to carve the turtle. The two looked at each other and laughed. The Duke asked them about it, and **Zi Jia** told him. When the turtle was served to the ministers, the Duke summoned **Zi Gong** but did not give it to him. **Zi Gong** grew angry, dipped his finger in the cooking pot, and tasted it before leaving. The Duke was enraged and wanted to kill **Zi Gong**.

**Zi Gong** and **Zi Jia** plotted to make the first move. **Zi Jia** said, *"Even keeping an old servant is hard to kill, let alone the ruler?"* So instead, he slandered **Zi Gong**. **Zi Jia** feared and followed his lead. In summer, he assassinated Duke Ling. The annals record: *"Zheng’s Prince Yi (归生) assassinated his lord."*

**Zi Jia’s** authority was insufficient. Unable to resist **Zi Gong’s** slander, and fearing retribution himself, he joined in the assassination—that is why the annals first name him as the villain.

The *Junzi* said: *"To be kind yet lacking in resolve is to be powerless."* At first, he was called *"keeping an old servant"*—that was virtue. But he did not punish **Zi Gong**, showing his lack of resolve. Unable to align himself with the Dao of virtue, he incurred the blame of regicide, and in truth, it was **Zi Gong’s** dipped finger that brought this disaster upon him.

There are those who linger on the sounds of metal and stone, yet cannot hear the *soundless sound*. Those who are captivated by the hues of black and yellow, yet cannot see the *colorless color*. Those who crave sweet and spicy flavors, yet cannot know the *tasteless taste*—they lose the true Dao and court death.

Hunting and chasing game, like the Duke’s obsession, drives men’s hearts to madness. **Note:** The pursuit of hunting replaces duty; indulgence in worldly actions, like hunting for prey, seeks only slaughter. Engaging in daily mental battles, chasing fleeting desires, and reflecting on them in stillness—this is the madness of the heart.

**Commentary:** Those who indulge in sensory pleasures and their desires, like hunting for prey, are consumed by the urge to kill—whether of game or of their own true nature. Their hearts race like a hunter’s, and in quiet contemplation, the disease of madness is revealed.

**Meaning:** Hunting is a proper ritual for the ruler. When done at the right time, it is ritual; when done excessively without restraint, it becomes disorder. Just as a man’s limbs and body must move and rest appropriately to be in harmony with ritual, to violate this is to invite madness. The *rituals* state that the Son of Heaven and the feudal lords each year perform three hunts: the first is for *dried beans* (乾豆), to be offered in ancestral sacrifices; the second is for *guests* (宾客), to foster goodwill between states; the third is to *supply the ruler’s kitchen* (充君之庖食), to ensure the proper timing of food.

When the time for hunting is not observed, it is called disrespect; hunting without proper timing is called tyranny. That is why in spring one hunts for *sparse game* (春搜), in summer for *thick-sprouting game* (夏苗), in autumn for *wild boars* (秋猕), and in winter for *large game* (冬狩)—all must await the intervals of farming to practice martial affairs.

The otter must not be sacrificed before the fish; nets and traps are not cast upon the rivers. The wolf must not be sacrificed before the beasts; snares are not spread across the wilds. Hawks and falcons must not strike before their appointed time; no fowling nets are raised in the forests. These are the rituals of hunting game, and the practice of *three drives* (三驱) displays the ruler’s benevolence, following the Dao of the seasons.

The Son of Heaven in *mid-spring* (仲春) teaches the mobilization of troops, and thus it is called hunting (畋). In *mid-summer* (仲夏), he teaches the cultivation of fields, and thus it is called searching (搜). In *mid-autumn* (仲秋), he teaches the regulation of arms, and thus it is called hunting (猎). In *mid-winter* (仲冬), he teaches grand reviews, and thus it is called hunting (狩). The *Grand Marshal* (大司马) oversees these affairs, while the *Mountain Wardens* (山虞) and *Marsh Wardens* (泽虞) provide their service—all to teach martial matters and demonstrate the proper timing to the people.

Yet there are those who do not follow the established precedents, who hunt recklessly in wild regions (禽荒), who exploit creatures and violate the seasons (暴物犯时), who do not return for ten spans of time (十旬不返), and who relentlessly pursue their desires (驰骋莫已), leading to madness. The people resent it, and the state is endangered—this is how violating ritual brings calamity.

How much more so when a man’s heart races with desire, chasing after fleeting pleasures (逐境争奔), indulging in sensory allurements (外溺色声) while harming his own *spirit and qi* (内伤神气), and thus inviting madness within his own body? Precious goods that are hard to obtain (难得之货) cause one to act imprudently.

**Note:** What is beyond one’s natural endowment (性分所无) is impossible to acquire (求不可得). To foolishly seek what cannot be obtained (妄求难得) obstructs the Way’s natural course.

**Commentary:** Precious goods (难得之货) refer to the natural endowments of a man’s body and mind (材器). What is beyond one’s natural endowment is impossible to acquire, hence to seek it foolishly obstructs the Way’s natural course.

**Explication:** Endowments (材器) are the goods of one’s nature. Pearls and rare treasures (珠珍) are the goods of the world. Goods beyond one’s nature, if acquired through deceit or falsehood, will obstruct the Way. Pearls and rare treasures, being hard to obtain, if coveted will bring disgrace upon one’s body. What is proper is to accept one’s natural endowment and uphold the constant Dao of Heaven.

If a ruler covets rare and exotic goods, the people will resent him, and the state will suffer. If one seeks rare and exotic goods for oneself, it will obstruct the Way and bring disgrace. This is to go against Heaven’s natural order (天倪).

**Heaven’s natural order** (天倪) refers to the inherent balance of Heaven’s creation. Zhuangzi said: *"The beginning and the end are like a circle, with no discernible starting point—this is called Heaven’s equilibrium."* Heaven’s equilibrium (天均) is Heaven’s natural order.

If all things are balanced according to their nature, how could there be any falsehood? All are naturally endowed by Heaven. Therefore, the sage acts for the *stomach* (腹) and not for the *eyes* (目).

**Commentary:** The stomach (腹) receives without discrimination, while the eyes (目) gaze wantonly and are ensnared by sensory dust (色尘). Without discrimination, one attains complete harmony; thus, the eyes are said to obstruct the Way by clinging to sensory dust, and the sage avoids this.

**Explication:** The sage does not act for the eyes because they perceive falsely and gaze wantonly, becoming ensnared by sensory dust, which disrupts harmony and nature. He acts for the stomach (腹), which embraces simplicity, sincerity, and harmony, shunning excessive indulgence in sensory pleasures—this can lead to the Way and transform the people. The sage does so.

Why? Because the sage’s vision is measured (目之视也，圣人为之方). Thus, he establishes the *rituals* (礼) and *classics* (经) to regulate them. One must not gaze licentiously (日无淫视), nor look upward upon entering a dwelling (将入户，视必下), nor turn one’s gaze back and forth (视瞻无回). When riding in a carriage, one must stand and look only at the five crossroads (立视五巂), and gaze only at the horse’s tail (式视马尾), never passing beyond the axle (顾不过毂), nor pointing or gazing wantonly (不妄指，不妄视)—this is how one guards against transgression and maintains reverence.

Those who lack reverence and caution, if they govern the state, will harm its administration; if they govern themselves, will harm their nature. That is why the sage does not act for them.

*Sensory dust* (色尘) refers to what is visible in form (色) and what stains the mind though unseen (尘). Dust is subtle, form is coarse—both obstruct the Way’s course. Those who cultivate the Dao first eliminate sensory forms, then turn inward to reflect their spirit (反神照内). Next, they eliminate sensory dust, extinguishing the mind and forgetting the external (灭心忘外). Dust is the stain upon the mind, the fixation of thought—thus, it is called dust. When the six senses arise, they give rise to six kinds of dust. Clearing the six coarse dusts, one still has six subtle dusts. Clearing the six subtle dusts, one still has six light dusts. Only when the six light dusts are cleared does one truly align with the Dao.

To see without form, hear without sound, taste without flavor, perceive without shape, understand without action—this is called *attaining the fruit of the Dao* (证道果). Therefore, one must abandon that and embrace this.

**Note:** Embrace this means to receive with the stomach (腹), abandon that means to cease wanton vision with the eyes (目).

**Commentary:** The eyes are abandoned because they gaze wantonly, while the stomach is embraced because it receives without discrimination.

**Explication:** The ruler’s heart must be rooted in wisdom and sagacity (睿圣为本), and the Way of governing must be founded upon purity and clarity (清净为基). To chase beasts across barren lands, to race carriages over sheer cliffs, to let the six horses run wild, to let ten thousand riders gallop unchecked, to vie with falcons for precedence, to share in the daring of bears and tigers—when the sun and moon are obscured, when banners and flags are tangled, when hunting forgets its return, when slaughter knows no end, when winds and rains are constant, and when the halls are left empty—this is called madness.

If a ruler further treasures distant lands’ produce, covets useless territories, craves delicacies and seeks them from the Western barbarians (讨西夷), or wages war against Dayuan (伐大宛) to acquire famous horses (名马), then the passes will be filled with restless spirits (不归之魄), and the border cities will be haunted by resentful souls (怨旷之魂). The people will scatter, households will dwindle, and the glorious ancestral temples (赫赫宗社) will nearly fall into the hands of bandits and enemies (寇雠).

Let these warnings be recorded in the annals (青史具书) as a lesson for future generations. Would it not be better to abandon these pursuits and embrace simplicity, following the clear teachings of the *Laozi* (老君) instead?

**Chapter Thirteen: *On the Daoist Master Guangcheng of Tang* – *Commentary on "Honor and Humiliation as Shock"*
*By Du Guangting*

**Exegesis:**
The previous chapter admonished against chasing worldly desires and succumbing to madness in pursuit of dusty illusions. This chapter reveals that both honor and humiliation are sources of alarm—treasuring the body as the root of calamity. The opening two lines establish the theme through inquiry, the next ten unfold the principle in response, and the conclusion employs metaphor to solidify the lesson.

**Commentary:**
Having already warned against the frenzy of greed, we now clarify that honor and humiliation are the greatest afflictions. Men rejoice in favor yet fear disgrace, unaware that favor breeds humiliation and humiliation follows favor—fortune and misfortune alternate, honor and shame cycle endlessly. The Sage comprehends this truth, thus regarding both as causes for alarm, abandoning them entirely. Only by embracing the Dao externally can one evade their grasp. Those who indulge worldly ambition cannot escape the reach of fortune or calamity—nor is it merely rank and title that should concern them, but the fate of all under heaven.

Thus, though bound in chains or adorned in ceremonial robes, the masses toil in hardship while some, though unworthy, occupy high stations. The wise cultivate humility as their foundation and stillness as their heart. Hence, the metaphor is invoked to illuminate the principle of security and peril.

**Honor and Humiliation as Shock**
*Annotation:* To grasp them is to tremble; to relinquish them is to grieve. So long as one clings to honor and humiliation, alarm is necessary.

*Exegesis:* "As" (*ruò*) means "like"—honor and humiliation provoke equal shock. To cling is to invite honor; to abandon is to invite humiliation. Men cannot reconcile their hearts to alternating fortune and misfortune, vainly clinging to glory when in power, yet trembling at disgrace when fallen. Thus, the warning is given to make them regard both as causes for alarm, urging them to equalize their response to honor and humiliation.

**Commentary:**
The Sage’s penetrating insight unites gain and loss, even regarding life and death as one. How much more should he disregard honor and fear disgrace? Hence, the admonition: *even honor should be met with alarm.* This is the unification of honor and humiliation, the merging of gain and loss.

Indeed, the ruler, though master of all under heaven, inheritor of a thousand kings, and communing with the Mysterious Origin, sovereign over all existence, must still govern decay and temper his anxieties to enjoy longevity and preserve his enduring lineage.

As for ministers, those who have received the blessings of nine promotions and three successive favors already bear heavy burdens—holding military seals and official insignia, clad in lofty caps and adorned carriages, their influence rivaling Wei and Huo. Yet they must rise with the wind and sleep with vigilance, tread lightly and stand at the precipice, lest they invite ruin and leave behind only disaster.

Thus, the Prime Minister of Zheng, though thrice dismissed, bore no resentment, and the Minister Kao, though thrice summoned, grew only more reverent—this is the way of understanding.

Wealth and nobility are what men desire, yet they must not be obtained without the Dao. Poverty and lowliness are what men abhor, yet they must not be abandoned without the Dao. If one attains the Dao, then wealth and nobility, poverty and lowliness, honor and humiliation, gain and loss—none should provoke alarm.

The *Yi [System]* states: *"Calamity and blessing share the same breath with the people."* The *Zhengyi* explains that it is not only calamity that men fear, but also blessing—why? For having attained blessing, one then fears its loss. This too is the meaning of *"honor and humiliation as shock."*

**Treasure the Great Peril as the Body**
*Annotation:* The body is the root of peril. Thus, to cherish the body is to treasure the greatest peril.

Here, it is said that treasuring the body is like treasuring the greatest peril, yet it is also said that treasuring the greatest peril is like the body—this is to clarify that the moment one’s heart turns to treasuring the body, it becomes the greatest peril. Where there is cherishing, the body itself is the peril. Hence, *"treasure the great peril as the body."*

*Exegesis:* The two preceding lines establish the central theme.

「》Commentary: *"Noble"* means *"cherish."* *"If"* also means *"as."* The body is the source of calamity. Yet indulging in sensory pleasures, cherishing competitive striving, and coveting wealth and honor—all these stem from having a body, thereby becoming the root of calamity. So if one cherishes the body, what else is there to cherish? One cherishes the greatest peril instead. For the body itself is the source of peril, and the absence of peril is the absence of the body—thus, cherishing the body is the same as cherishing the greatest peril. If one could be free of peril, one would also forget the body. This is why it is said: *"Peril is like cherishing life, the body is the source of peril—hence, cherish the greatest peril as the body."*

The *Zhengyi* states: *"The body is the root of calamity. Thus, to cherish the body is to treasure the greatest peril."* The preceding two lines establish this principle.

**Commentary:** Earlier, it was stated that *"honor and humiliation as shock"*—fearing both blessing and peril—lest men misunderstand, a question is posed: *"What is meant by ‘honor and humiliation as shock’?"* For when one attains honor, one becomes arrogant and self-satisfied, and this inevitably brings disaster. Thus, honor is the root of humiliation. Therefore, it is said that *"honor is the lesser."*

**Commentary:** Earlier, it was stated that *"honor and humiliation as shock"*—lest men fail to grasp its meaning, the question is posed: *"What is meant by ‘honor and humiliation as shock’?"* The answer is given: *"Honor is the lesser."* The reason honor is lesser is that relying on honor breeds arrogance and self-satisfaction. Arrogance and self-satisfaction breed disaster, and disaster comes from honor—thus, honor is the root of humiliation. Hence, honor is lesser.

The *Zhengyi* explains: *"The body is the root of calamity. Thus, to cherish the body is to treasure the greatest peril."* Lest men fail to understand that the body itself is the root of peril, the question is raised again.

**The *Zhengyi* states:** *"The body is the root of calamity. Thus, to cherish the body is to treasure the greatest peril."* The *Zhengyi* further clarifies: *"The body is the source of all calamities. Pain, itch, cold, and heat are the body’s physical afflictions; sorrow, worry, and vexation are the body’s mental burdens. Knowing the body as the source of great peril, one observes past and present—who has ever preserved their body intact?"* Peril arises with the body; if the body exists, peril is born. Honor and humiliation follow in turn—when honor reaches its peak, humiliation arrives. The *Laozi* fears men may not comprehend this, so he presents two examples to clarify, and then proceeds with a further question.

The *Liezī* [*Sky Ascendant’s Chapter on the Mysterious and the Auspicious*] states: *"From birth to death, the Great Transformation has four stages: infancy, youth, old age, and death. In infancy, the spirit is focused, the will is singular, virtue is full, and the qi is harmonious—no evils are present. In youth, blood is abundant, the qi overflows, desires surge, and the heart expands—virtue is nearly exhausted. In old age, desires and thoughts grow weak, the body nears its end, and nothing can be done—compared to youth, the qi is already diminished. In death, one returns to stillness, reaching its ultimate state."* These four stages follow one another in sequence, relying on each other to manifest. Only those who attain the Dao reverse this process. Those who cultivate the body assist themselves in this way.

**What is meant by "honor and humiliation as shock"?**
**Commentary:** Honor is the lesser. Earlier, it was stated that *"honor and humiliation as shock"*—fearing both blessing and peril—lest men fail to understand, the question is posed: *"What is meant by ‘honor and humiliation as shock’?"* The *Zhengyi* answers: *"Honor is the lesser."* The reason honor is lesser is that relying on honor breeds arrogance and self-satisfaction. Arrogance and self-satisfaction inevitably lead to disaster—thus, disaster arises from honor, making honor the root of humiliation. Hence, it is said that *"honor is the lesser."*

The *Zhengyi* further states: *"The *Laozi* fears men may not yet grasp the preceding meaning, so he raises a question to clarify it further."* Having posed the question, he now provides the reasoning for the answer.

*"Honor is the lesser"* means that humiliation follows honor, and honor is the first step toward disaster. Common men see honor as a blessing, but the sage regards it as lesser. Relying on honor leads to arrogance and self-satisfaction.

The *Spring and Autumn Annals* records: *"In the fourth year of Duke Huan of Qi’s reign, the son of Duke Zhuang of Wei, Public Child Zhou Yu, relied on his honor and loved military affairs. His minister, Shi Kuang, advised Duke Zhuang of Wei: ‘I have heard that one teaches a beloved son through righteousness, not by indulging in his evil ways. Arrogance, extravagance, debauchery, and dissipation—these are the roots of evil. The four arise from excessive honor and wealth.’ The Duke did not heed the warning. The following year, Duke Huan of Qi was enthroned, and Zhou Yu assassinated him. The people of Wei then killed Zhou Yu."* This shows that disaster comes from relying on honor—thus, *"honor is the lesser."*

Attaining honor is like shock, losing it is like shock—this is what is meant by *"honor and humiliation as shock."*

**Commentary:** When one gains honor, it is called *"honor."* When one loses it, it is called *"humiliation."* *"As shock"* means that honor and humiliation are cyclical—honor is the root of humiliation. Ordinary beings rejoice in honor and fear humiliation. The sage warns: *"When you gain honor, treat it as if you were losing it; when you face humiliation, treat it as if you were gaining honor—both should be met with caution."* Thus, it is concluded: *"This is what is meant by ‘honor and humiliation as shock.’"*

**Commentary:** When one gains honor, they rejoice; when one faces humiliation, they fear. The sage warns that calamity and blessing are cyclical, like intertwined ropes—honor and humiliation are not fixed. Why should one only fear humiliation? If one fears calamity, they should also fear arrogance and dissipation when honor arrives. The fear should be equal. Thus, it is concluded: *"This is what is meant by ‘honor and humiliation as shock.’"*

The *Zhengyi* states: *"Attaining honor without fear, facing humiliation with dread—this is the common way. But to fear arrogance and dissipation when honor arrives, and to recognize calamity when humiliation comes—this is the way of the gentleman. Attaining honor while fearing it, one grows cautious each day, thereby avoiding the humiliation of disaster. Attaining honor without caution, indulging in arrogance and pride, one will surely face the humiliation of ruin."*

For rulers, relying on Heaven’s favor without concern for the people leads to the loss of their throne. For ministers, relying on their lord’s favor, abusing power, and looking down on others leads to punishment and regret.

*"Intertwined"* means *"to bind."* *"Entangled"* means *"to tie."* It describes the constant cycle of entanglement.

**What is meant by "cherish the great peril as the body"?**
**Commentary:** Lest men fail to understand that the body itself is the root of peril, the question is posed.

The *Zhengyi* states: *"Lest men fail to understand, the question is raised to clarify."* The *Zhengyi* further explains: *"Just as it was asked how ‘honor and humiliation as shock’ is understood, so too is this question posed. Common men gain honor without considering its potential humiliation, so when humiliation arrives, they are shocked. The *Laozi* warns those who rely on honor, hence he raises this question again."*

*"The reason I have great peril is that I have a body.*
**Commentary:** The body is an illusory form, inherently lacking true reality; its peril lies in my fixation upon it—feeling pleasure and pain, cold and heat—as though they were my own afflictions.
**Exegesis:** This great peril arises because I cling to the body’s form, craving honor and dreading humiliation, disputing right and wrong. When I fail to obtain what I desire, deep anxiety seizes me; when my desires dominate, my spirit is exhausted by avarice and my body worn by relentless striving. What greater suffering than this weary toil?

**Explanation:** *Pdàn* (苶) means *exhausted labor*. *‘I’* refers to this named body. Since the body’s form brings peril in its wake, the pursuit of status and advantage makes one crave honor; fear of loss and danger makes one loathe humiliation. If one forcibly imposes upon worldly affairs and vainly debates what is right or wrong, success leads to arrogance and unbridled indulgence, while failure brings distress and fear that harm one’s nature. Harming one’s nature exhausts the spirit within, while indulgence drains the body without—some grow gaunt by riversides, others tremble in marshes, their forms fatigued and minds enslaved. This peril runs deep indeed.

*When I have no body, what peril can I have?*
**Commentary:** If one realizes that heaven and earth are but the harmonious interplay of *qi*, all belonging not to oneself, and discerns that the body is not truly one’s own—merging with the boundless *Dao*—what peril remains?
**Exegesis:** The ‘no body’ refers to those who perceive the body’s form as empty and illusory, not truly real. They must practice *zuòwàng* (坐忘, forgetting while seated), abandoning sensory perceptions, discarding their intellect, and aligning with the boundless *Tóng* (大通, Great Unity). Thus, the self is extinguished, and the *qi* flows naturally—no longer entangled in the dualities of honor and humiliation, love or hate. What need remains for the *Emperor’s* (帝) suspended bonds when all is already liberated from great peril?

Hence, *‘When I have no body, I have no peril’*—this is the key to nurturing life. *‘Commitment and harmony’* (委和) is as *Zhuangzi* (庄子) explains in response to Shun’s question: *‘The body is not yours to possess; it is the form given by heaven and earth. Life is not yours to command; it is the harmony of heaven and earth. Nature and destiny are not yours to control; they are the natural flow of heaven and earth.’* This means that heaven and earth gather *qi* to give rise to life—*qi* ascending and descending is the way of harmony. If the body were truly yours, its beauty and ugliness, birth and death, would be subject to your will. But when *qi* gathers, life emerges, and you cannot restrain it; when *qi* disperses, death comes, and you cannot stop it. It is clear that this gathering and dispersal arise naturally, not by your doing. Thus, one moves without knowing where one goes, dwells without knowing what one holds, eats without knowing the taste—all within the realm of naturalness. To grasp this is to approach the *Dao*; why then should one fear great peril?

*Therefore, those who hold their body as the world’s treasure can entrust it to the world; those who love their body as the world’s treasure can commit it to the world.*
**Commentary:** This passage begins with warnings against favor and humiliation, concluding with the metaphor of entrustment and commitment. If one is shocked by favor and humiliation, one has not yet forgotten the value of honor and love. Thus, to measure humiliation against favor, one finds favor less than humiliation; to compare honor with love, one finds honor less than love. Those still startled by favor and humiliation retain some attachment to them, and those who cling to honor and love have not yet transcended the dualities of the world. Hence, the initial admonition is to treat favor as humiliation, and the latter aim is to forget both favor and humiliation entirely, using the metaphor of entrustment to illustrate the ultimate state of *comprehensive forgetting*.

To forget favor and humiliation is to cease all shock; to forget the body is to sever the root of peril; to forget the world is to transcend even the metaphor of entrustment.
**Exegesis:** The ruler who exalts his body as the world’s master must necessarily act in self-aggrandizement, imposing his will upon others. Thus, the people do not rally to him, and his rule is but a temporary burden. **Explanation:** Such a ruler, who prizes his body as the world’s master, will inevitably elevate himself above others, creating blessings and threats to dominate them. He will indulge his desires, exhausting the finest adornments and seeking the utmost luxury, while externally oppressing others and waging wars, and internally reveling in palaces of jade and pools of wine and flesh.

「To gather the sighs of resentment from all under heaven while indulging in ease and comfort for oneself, to exalt one’s title and deepen the moats and ramparts, to bestow rewards with lofty halls and artificial lakes, to dwell among the concubines and attendants—yet unaware of the people’s estrangement in heart and virtue—while striving to be the foundation of ten thousand generations, only to perish without respite, as though one’s rule were but a temporary trust in the world.

**Exegesis:** If one cherishes his body and regards himself as the master of all under heaven, then loving his body will lead him to be benevolent toward others, and benevolence will naturally spread joy. Thus, he may entrust himself to the millions and rule over them for long.

**Explanation:** When a ruler cherishes his body and governs all under heaven, he must act with humility and modesty, with frugality and restraint. Humility and modesty prevent resentment and enmity, while frugality and restraint curb his desires. Without resentment and enmity, the people are at peace; without excessive desires, the people prosper. Thus, he harmonizes his kin within, and the myriad people below; he delights both near and far, fostering mutual affection between ruler and subject. He spares the horses of a thousand households, conserves the wealth of ten families, eats modestly and lives in humble chambers, refraining from external conquests and internal burdens upon the people. His reign endures long, and he may forever entrust himself to the world.

**Exegesis:** Yet this chapter begins with the warning of favor and humiliation, concluding with the concept of entrustment, to illustrate that the warning of favor and humiliation is not as profound as forgetting them; that holding onto noble love is not as beneficial as forgetting noble love; and that entrusting oneself to the world is not as sublime as forgetting the world. Thus, the body itself becomes a source of great calamity, for favor and humiliation arise from the body. To forget the body is to forget favor and humiliation. When favor comes, the enlightened do not rejoice; when humiliation arrives, they do not panic. They do not bow to wealth and nobility, nor do they falter in poverty and disgrace. Who but the most accomplished can attain this?

To forget the body is to merge with the Dao/Way, ascending to the heavens of clouds, acting without contrivance alongside the Dao/Way—what peril could there be then? Who but the most Daoist can achieve this?

To forget the world is to wander the heart in serene detachment, to obscure the spirit in emptiness, to let things be as they naturally are without interference, so that one’s thoughts are not muddled by selfishness, and the world is governed without private intent. Then the eyes see nothing, the ears hear nothing, the heart knows nothing, the *qi* is unobstructed, the spirit safeguards the form, and the form attains longevity. His merit surpasses all nations yet he does not boast; his transformation benefits all things yet he does not claim credit. Nameless and unrenowned, he lets things fulfill themselves, standing firm in the unfathomable while wandering in the boundless, uniting with all things in essence and returning to the void.

Thus, the Yellow Emperor attained this and ascended to heaven, and the Great Bright attained this and rose to the Mysterious—this is how the Sage forgets the world and reaches the Dao/Way.

The interpretations of the *Tàishàng Zhī Jūn* and the *Xià Zhī Shì* are found in the seventeenth chapter.

*Chapter Fourteen: "The Chapter of That Which Cannot Be Seen"*

**Commentary by Tang Master Guāngchéng, as recorded by Dù Guāngtíng:**

The preceding chapter expounds on the peril of valuing the body, urging instead to forget and relinquish all possession. This chapter reveals the ineffable essence, which transcends all form—thus, in its application, all things are harmonized.

The first three sentences declare that the Dao/Way cannot be sought through sight or sound. The next six sentences further demonstrate that all inquiry must ultimately return to the void. Five sentences follow, illustrating the Dao’s unfathomable workings, and the final four conclude with ancient precedents to validate the present teaching.

**Exposition:**
The prior discussion on forgetting the body and its afflictions establishes the foundation for cultivation and realization. Here, it is proclaimed that the Dao/Way transcends both color and sound, declaring the subtlety of the ultimate truth. Since sight and hearing cannot grasp it, we must point to its unity beyond perception—though its name may seem obscure and elusive, it responds without being seen, and its governance of body and state forms the root of all transformation.

*"That which cannot be seen when looked upon"* is called **Yí** [夷].
**Annotation:** This elucidates the Dao/Way.
Yí means "level and easy." The Dao/Way is not a color, hence it cannot be seen. Yet within the absence of color, it manifests all colors, thus it is named Yí.

*"That which cannot be heard when listened to"* is called **Xī** [希].
**Annotation:** Xī refers to the subtlest sound. The Dao/Way is not a sound, hence it cannot be heard. Yet within the absence of sound, it alone harmonizes all sounds, thus it is named Xī.

*"That which cannot be grasped when seized"* is called **Wēi** [微].
**Annotation:** *Bó* [搏] means to hold or grasp. Wēi means "subtle." The Dao/Way is formless, hence it cannot be seized. Yet within the absence of form, it manifests all forms, thus it is named Wēi.

**Commentary:** This elucidates the Dao/Way.
Those who seek the Dao/Way through sight pursue it as color; those who seek it through hearing pursue it as sound; those who seek it through grasping pursue it as form. Since the Dao/Way is neither sound, color, nor form, all such seeking proves futile. Because it cannot be obtained, one might assume it does not exist—yet within the void of color, it responds to all colors; within the void of sound, it harmonizes all sounds; within the void of form, it assumes all forms. Thus, it possesses *color without color, sound without sound, form without form*—hence it is called Yí, Xī, and Wēi.

Yí is what is called *"the manifestation of the Dao/Way, yet not the Dao/Way itself."* Yí means "level and easy." Xī refers to the subtle and wondrous in sound. *Bó* [搏] means to grasp. The exposition states:
The eyes see only the level and easy yet cannot perceive the Dao/Way—for the Dao/Way is without color. The ears hear only the subtle and silent yet cannot hear the Dao/Way—for the Dao/Way is without sound. The hands grasp only the subtle and elusive yet cannot seize its form—for the Dao/Way is without form.

Yet with spiritual vision, one sees *color without color*; with attuned *qi*, one hears *sound without sound*; with enlightened wisdom, one recognizes *form without form*. All colors arise and all sounds harmonize, all forms manifest—none of this could occur without the Dao/Way, none could be completed without it. The Dao/Way alone can respond to all colors, harmonize all sounds, and assume all forms; thus, it is forcibly named Yí, Xī, and Wēi.

The Dao/Way cannot be spoken of—any speech about it is false. Hence, all descriptions of the Dao/Way are merely provisional, not the Dao/Way itself.

Zhuāngzǐ said:
*"Do not see with the eyes, but see with the spirit; do not hear with the mind, but hear with the *qi*.*
Thus, one attains the subtle and wondrous, merging with the Dao/Way."

These three aspects cannot be interrogated, hence they are unified as one.
**Annotation:** The three aspects—Yí, Xī, and Wēi—are attempts to interrogate the Dao/Way. Since the Dao/Way is neither sound, color, nor form, no interrogation can succeed; only Yí, Xī, and Wēi are obtained. The Dao/Way is not Yí, Xī, or Wēi, hence they are again unified as one.

**Commentary:** The three aspects—Yí, Xī, and Wēi—are provisional names for the Dao/Way, yet they are all empty in essence. These three coalesce into three realms, then into three worlds, then into the Three Powers, then into the Three Lights, then into the Three Primordials of the body, then into the Three Ones within. All are manifestations of the Great Dao’s refined essence in motion. Unified once more, they return to the original subtle Dao/Way.

**The Three Realms** are the ancestral *qi* of the Three Sovereigns, their colors being green, yellow, and white—these are mere names. The Three Primordial *Qi* of Xuānyuánshǐ are the ancestral progenitors of all heavens and the origin of all transformations.

**The Three Worlds** are:
- The Desire Realm, with six heavens governing the Nine Immortals,
- The Form Realm, with eighteen heavens governing the Nine True Ones,
- The Formless Realm, with four heavens governing the Nine Saints.

**The Three Powers** are:
- Heaven (One), Earth (Two), and Humanity (Three).
As stated in the *Chōngxū Zhēn Jīng*:
*"The clear, floating *qi* is Heaven; the turbid, sedimentary *qi* is Earth; the balanced, harmonious *qi* is Humanity."* Thus, they are called the Three Powers.

**The Three Lights** are:
- The light of the Great Sun is the Day,
- The light of the Great Moon is the Month,
- The residual light of the Day and Month is the Stars.

**The Three Primordials** are:
- The brain, the *Ní Jiǔ Gōng* [泥九宫], governing the Upper Primordial,
- The heart, the *Jiàng Gōng* [绛宫], governing the Middle Primordial,
- The *Dāntián* below the navel, governing the Lower Primordial.
The Three Primordial Deities each govern yin and yang, nurturing the ten thousand two thousand *shénqì* within the body.

**The Three Ones** are:
- The Upper Primordial is called *Yuān Yī* [元一],
- The Middle Primordial is called *Zhēn Yī* [真一],
- The Lower Primordial is called *Zhèng Yī* [正一].
The Three One Deities oversee the circulation of *qi*, the preservation of essence, and the retention of form. In the Upper Pure, the *Huífēng* [回风] blends and refines the path of the Three Ones.

In antiquity, the Yellow Emperor, instructed by Master Níng, ascended *Éméi Shān* to pay homage to the Heavenly True Person, receiving this teaching. After a thousand days of profound contemplation, he unified with the Three One True Ones, governing the thirty-six thousand spirits, and ascended to Heaven upon a Yellow Dragon.

The Celestial is suspended above, the Earthly is congealed below, and humanity arises between them. The Three mutually engender and transform one another, without beginning or end.

**Master Liè** said: The Celestial is the accumulation of *qi*, the Earthly is the accumulation of matter. The sun and moon are the luminous radiance within the *qi*. The **Three One** is the "having" within the "non-having" of the middle, while the **Three Primordial** is the "non-having" within the "having" of the middle. Through the interplay of having and non-having, the **Three One** Deities manifest as *shénqì* (spirit-*qi*).

The Three together generate within humanity, hence the saying: *"When mortals obtain it, they live; when they lose it, they die."*

The **Deity (神)** is born from the Celestial's *yángqì* (yang-*qi*), manifesting as the human capacity for movement and repose, response and calculation, wisdom and strategy.

**Essence (精)** is the *qi* of the Earthly, the substance of the hundred grains, the essence of the five flavors, condensed and accumulated into form.

**Qi (气)** is the harmonious middle *qi*.

The **Dao/Way’s** subtle and wondrous function descends into the human body, warming through breath and nourishing humanity.

The Three intermingle and coalesce within the body—this is called *"mingling as One"*.

Its upper reaches are not luminous, its lower depths are not obscure.
**Annotation:** Those above must be clear, those below must be dark.
Yet the Dao/Way, though above, is not above; though in the upper, it is not luminous. Though below, it is not below; though in the lower, it is not obscure. Yet it can ascend and descend, clarify and obscure.

Who beneath Heaven could match this?

**Meaning:** When it is luminous, it must be radiantly above—this is the accumulation of yang. When it is obscure, it must be darkly below—this is the accumulation of yin. Yin and yang have fixed proportions, and luminosity and obscurity have fixed appearances. Thus, all things with form and substance have fixed locations.

Yet the Great Dao/Way, when above, is not radiantly luminous—it is not yang. When below, it is not darkly obscure—it is not yin. Therefore, it is neither yin nor yang, yet it can be yin and yang. It cannot be sought through fixed appearances, nor grasped through fixed proportions.

The Celestial obtains the Dao/Way and becomes clear—this is its ability to ascend.
The Earthly obtains the Dao/Way and becomes tranquil—this is its ability to descend.
Yang obtains the Dao/Way and becomes dynamic—this is its ability to clarify.
Yin obtains the Dao/Way and becomes still—this is its ability to obscure.

Thus, it is the most wondrous beneath Heaven.
The *Yì* [易] **Appendix (系)** says:
*"Who beneath Heaven could match this?*
It speaks of the Dao’s profound function thus: If it is not the utmost subtlety and mystery of all things beneath Heaven, who could partake in this?"

**Endless motion (绳绳)**, yet nameless. **Annotation:** *Glǐng* [绳绳] means unceasing movement.
Neither luminous nor obscure, its motion is boundless—yet the function of generating life cannot be named. It is not a thing that generates things, yet it eternally generates life, without ever being a thing itself. Its wondrous root is profound, hence it is said to *"return to the non-thing"*.

**Explication:** *Glǐng* [绳绳] means unceasing movement.
The wondrous root generates and transforms all things, its motion boundless. Though the function of generating life is forcibly named, it is not a thing that generates things, nor is it generated itself. Its profound root is serene, never having been a thing—hence it is said to *"return to the non-thing"*.

**Meaning:** The Dao/Way alone possesses this wondrous root, engendering and transforming all things, its application and function unceasing. It generates things without being a thing—things are their own things. It is generated without being generated—life is its own life. The Dao’s traces are nonexistent; it does not rely on its functions. Its depth is wondrous and profound, beyond being or non-being—this is the non-thing.

Things are but reflections.
Thus it is called *"the form without form, the symbol without substance"*—this is the *huánghuǎng* (incorporeal).

**Annotation:** This is the *"form without fixed form, the symbol without material substance"*, neither nameable as being nor as non-being. Being is hard to name, hence it is called *huánghuǎng* (incorporeal).

**Explication:** *State* [状] means form, *symbol* [象] means material reflection. The wondrous root mingles and coalesces, yet originally has no form or substance. All transformations draw from it, and all things flow into their forms. Thus one may say it is *"the form within the non-form, the symbol within the non-substance"*. It cannot be named as being, nor can it be constrained as non-being. Being is hard to name, hence it is called *huánghuǎng* (incorporeal).

**Meaning:** The Dao/Way generates and nurtures all things, causing movement and growth to form. Thus it can manifest form within the non-form and symbol within the non-substance.

When spoken of as non-being, then form and symbol arise from it.
When spoken of as being, then it is boundless and elusive.

Neither being nor non-being, it is *huánghuǎng* (incorporeal).
*Huánghuǎng* means neither being nor non-being.

The *Yì* [易] **Hexagram of Qián (乾)** says:
*"Clouds move and rain descends, all things flow into form."*
It speaks of how all categories of things spread and take form.

To welcome it, one does not see its beginning; to follow it, one does not see its end.
**Annotation:** Without a start, welcoming does not reveal its beginning; without an end, following does not reveal its conclusion.

**Explication:** The utmost subtlety is formless, the utmost vastness cannot be circumscribed. Thus, those who welcome it cannot grasp its beginning, and those who follow it cannot perceive its end. Without a beginning, there is no start; without an end, there is no conclusion. Without start or end, it cannot be obtained through welcoming or following.

**Meaning:** The supreme Dao/Way stands alone, without beginning or end. It is neither prior nor posterior that can be exhaustively traced, nor can it be obtained through welcoming or following. Hence it is said: *"It endures beyond the ancient past without aging, and arises in the final age without youth."* It precedes all ten thousand things without being their origin, and follows countless eons without being their conclusion. From this perspective, how could it be obtained through welcoming or following?

Moreover, it fills and permeates Heaven and Earth, encircles and embraces the void. There is no place without Dao/Way, no direction without it. It is neither of the present nor of the past—what could be its beginning, what its end? It is neither before nor after.

---

All things have a direction, and thus they are followed; all things have an origin, and thus they are welcomed. The Dao/Way has neither coming nor going—it cannot be sought through following or welcoming.

**Meaning:** Hold fast to the ancient Dao/Way to govern the present. *(Note:)* By adhering to the ancient principle of *wuwei* (non-action), one governs the affairs of the present, thus returning to simplicity and purity. *(Commentary:)* This illustrates how ancient sages and kings constantly cultivated *wuwei* to transform the people. Therefore, it is admonished: *"If today’s rulers can uphold the ancient practice of non-action to govern, then transformation occurs without words."*

**Meaning:** *Govern* means *to regulate*. The ancients transformed through *wuwei* and inaction; today’s rulers transform through form and name. Because of *wuwei*, governance is easy; because of form and substance, transformation is difficult. If today’s rulers adhere to the ancient great Dao of *wuwei* to govern, they will swiftly achieve great peace.

The sage-rulers of antiquity possessed *upper virtue* without virtue—this is *wuwei*. The later rulers of the *Ji-Ye* era restricted names and instruments—this is *youwei* (action). To govern the *you* (having) with the *wu* (non-), there is yet hope of order. To govern the *you* with the *you*, chaos will ensue among the myriad.

To know the beginning of antiquity is called the *Dao’s framework*. *(Note:)* To know what the ancients practiced is called the framework of Daoist transformation. *(Commentary:)* Earlier, it was said to hold fast to the ancient Dao, now it is said to know the ancient beginning, clarifying that the Dao is both practiced and transformed. Therefore, it is emphasized: *"If rulers know the ancient beginning, practicing *wuwei* to govern, they should embrace and preserve simplicity, achieving clarity and tranquility—this is the framework of governing through the Dao."*

**Meaning:** Fearing that rulers may find it difficult to apply the ancient ways, lest they fail to practice *wuwei*, this passage is repeated to further exhort them. Knowing that *wuwei* is easy to transform, the ancient Dao is easy to follow—its expansion lies in the people. Is it not that the difference between refinement and purity lies here? The framework of governing the Dao is found in this. Hence it is said: *"Draw its framework, and ten thousand threads align; draw its framework, and ten thousand threads rise."* Governing the self and the state is no different.

*"Achieving clarity and tranquility"*—words from the *Taixuan Jing*. Governing the state by adhering to the Dao of *wuwei* restores simplicity and returns to purity. Governing the self by adhering to *wuwei* preserves the spirit and makes *qi* supreme. When *qi* is supreme, longevity follows; when the spirit is preserved, one ascends to the Mysterious. This is the essential principle of governing the state and cultivating the self.

**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Virtuous Gentleman**

*(Commentary:)* The previous chapter clarified that the subtle origin transcends form, yet all applications are harmonized. This chapter explains that those who are profound and penetrating are always unfilled yet capable of exhaustion.

The opening five lines mark the ancient virtues as the foundation of subtlety. The following *"Yúruò"* (profound and elusive) seven lines demonstrate how virtue and demeanor are difficult to discern. The *"Who can descend"* two lines reveal the gradual cultivation. The concluding *"Preserve this"* passage concludes the proof without stagnation.

**Meaning:** To further elucidate the subtlety of the ancient Dao from the previous chapter, it is restated that the ancient Daoist’s virtue and conduct are profound and all-encompassing, with extensive analogies. Sometimes profound and elusive, sometimes dignified and expansive, sometimes earnest and vast, sometimes serene and still—his virtue is thus. If people embody and apply it, they will never fall into excess.

The ancient virtuous gentleman is subtle, profound, and impenetrable. *(Note:)* *Shì* (士) means *affairs*. It speaks of those ancient who took the Dao as their affairs—toward subtle and profound teachings, they were all-pervading and insightful, their virtue and demeanor deep and unfathomable.

*(Commentary:)* *Ancient* means *past*. *Shì* means *affairs*. It speaks of those in antiquity who took the Dao as their affairs—precise, essential, and profound, they were penetrating and boundless, embodying the Dao and transcending words, vast yet without obstruction, their scope and capacity boundless and unfathomable.

**Meaning:** *Shì* refers to those ancient Daoists. Those who practice the Dao’s conduct, in whatever station—whether in the wilderness or at court—are called *shì*. Those who cultivate with intent, departing from the world and its customs, are *mountain-valley scholars*. Those who speak of benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trustworthiness, who are respectful, restrained, and yielding, are *scholars of the age*. Those who achieve great deeds and establish great names, who rectify the relationship between ruler and subject and clarify hierarchy, are *court scholars*. Those who dwell in marshes and secluded places, fishing to evade the world, are *river-sea scholars*. Those who blow and exhale, inhaling and exhaling, stretching like bears and birds, are *guiding-and-pulling scholars*.

But those who, without deliberate cultivation, are naturally elevated; who, without benevolence and righteousness, are refined; who, without deeds and fame, govern; who, without rivers and seas, are at ease; who, without guiding-and-pulling, live long—these are *Daoist scholars*.

The first five *shì* have measurable applications and definable affairs. Only the *Daoist scholar* is subtle and profound, responding with boundless penetration. Their application is vast and empty, difficult to discern by intellect—neither lacking nor excessive, boundless and tranquil, yet all virtues follow. This is why they are unfathomable.

Since their virtue and capacity are unfathomable, their demeanor is described. *(Note:)* Since their virtue and capacity are difficult to discern, their demeanor is described to clarify the following text. *(Commentary:)* Though the virtuous scholar’s proper bearing can enlighten others, their presence radiates heavenly luminosity, their virtue and capacity beyond comprehension. Thus, their demeanor is described, seeking humility and compliance to transform the vulgar and guide the common.

**Meaning:** The virtuous Daoist, rectifying themselves, transforms others; rectifying their conduct, others follow. Observing their virtue and demeanor, all things naturally awaken. Their virtue is vast and settled, and what they illuminate is heavenly light, not human radiance. Heavenly light naturally shines, so people see themselves, things see themselves. When each sees only itself without perceiving the other, their virtue is vast and settled, beyond measure. It demonstrates the way of yielding to things and guiding the common through compliance.

「Thus, Zhuangzi replied to Shun: *"The Way of life and death is not yours alone to possess; it is the yielding and compliance of Heaven and Earth."* One should approach it with caution as if crossing a river in winter—**豫** means to be at ease yet vigilant. The virtuous person, even amidst the entanglements of life, acts like one crossing a winter river: others fear the snares of desire, but I do not cling, so I remain vigilant and unperturbed.

**Explanation:** **豫** signifies being both relaxed and watchful. Just as crossing a winter river is fraught with peril—desire ensnares and drowns the multitude. Though the virtuous person dwells in the world, they are not ensnared by desire, like one crossing a winter river, hence their vigilant ease. For this reason, they are vigilant: the ice is firm and strong, and there is no fear of sinking or falling.

**Meaning:** The virtuous person, untainted by desire, is vigilant yet at ease, like one crossing a winter river where the ice is solid and no sinking occurs. Desire cannot assail them, illustrating the Way of those who practice the Dao. This is the ultimate precept, indeed a treasure.

Moreover, they fear the scrutiny of their neighbors—**犹豫** signifies hesitation, like a dog’s doubt. In the north, people say that when crossing a river’s ice, if one sees fox tracks, the ice is safe, for foxes would not cross where it might break. Yet foxes, before daring to cross, listen for the sound of water beneath the ice to vanish. This is the image of hesitation and vigilance.

Ordinary people, ignorant of Dao cultivation, indulge in desire and emotion without fear or doubt, only to fall into ruin. Those who practice the Dao know desire yet do not submit to it; they fear the perils of crossing the river, the judgment of neighbors, and the whispers of the world. Even in private, they do not deceive, and at every turn, they take caution as their guide. This is the conduct of the Dao.

For indeed, when one does evil in secret, the spirits know it. When one commits transgressions openly, the neighbors know it. How then can one avoid vigilance?

The *Analects* says: *"Do not associate with your neighbors, your village, or your clan."* Here, ten households are called neighbors, five neighbors make a village, twelve thousand five hundred households make a clan, and five hundred households make a party.

They stand solemn as a guest, yet dissolve like ice about to thaw—**俨** means solemn respect, **涣** means to disperse, **释** means to release. Stepping outside as if greeting a great guest, one’s reverence is fixed; yet the virtuous person’s conduct is not bound by things, dissolving like spring ice, free and unencumbered.

**Meaning:** **俨**, solemn respect; **涣**, to disperse; **释**, to release. When one exits, they should be as reverent as if meeting a great guest—so the host honors the guest, and the guest honors the host. Both parties observe respect and propriety, a common practice. Yet the ultimate person remains serene and silent, vigilant and self-examining, always as respectful as a guest before their host, and thus free from reckless desire. Their good deeds flow without obstruction, dissolving and adapting like spring ice, never rigid or fixed.

They are sincere as uncarved wood—**敦**, sincere and thick; **朴**, uncarved simplicity. Though their conduct is fluid and unencumbered, they do not boast of themselves, but remain sincere and thick in virtue, like simplicity unadorned.

**Meaning:** The ultimate person, though outwardly fluid and adaptable, yielding to all things, inwardly possesses warmth, gentleness, and sincerity. Their heart is still and concentrated, so they suffer no harm from strife, finding contentment in natural harmony.

Their virtue is vast as an empty valley—**旷**, spacious; their virtue and capacity are vast and boundless, able to contain all things, like that empty valley.

The **virtue** is both sincere and vast—**敦** thick and steadfast, **量** boundless in scope—
it contains all good and evil without discrimination,
and upholds all right and wrong without obstruction,
spacious as an empty valley, swallowing all things whole.

Mixed and indistinct as turbid water.
**Annotation:** Blending with the world’s luminous chaos,
like turbid water that yet holds clarity within.
**Explication:** The virtuous one’s heart is pure yet receptive,
harmonizing with the world like dust in the light,
undistinguished in their blending,
so indistinct as turbid water—
their presence is seen, but their essence remains unfathomable.

**Meaning:** When water is clear, it reflects all virtues and vices,
yet others measure its depth and shallowness.
But in autumn’s flood, when muddy waves surge,
the tumult of rushing currents confounds even cattle and horses—
deep and shallow become unknowable,
gazing upon them leaves one in bewilderment.
Who could dare to wade through such depths?

The ultimate person blends with the world’s luminosity,
mixing their traces like flowing water,
not revealing their subtlety,
like turbid water—
their form is visible, yet their path remains unseen.

The sovereign governing the realm, riding the times,
must first manifest their **virtue**.
They should not indulge in minute scrutiny,
but instead present the **Dao**’s broad and simple ways,
so the people remain unaware and unknowing,
following the **Way**’s natural order—
this is the **Dao**’s transformation,
and no greater good exists.

Who can then, in the midst of turbid longing,
with stillness settle the waves,
and let clarity arise slowly?

**Annotation:** Who can, in this enduring clarity,
still seek higher methods,
stirring and refining their practice,
so that the pure nature does not stagnate in **Dao**,
but moves forth gently?

**Explication:** This teaching is without obstruction.
Who can, with their clear and still nature,
settle the stirrings of love and desire,
as if water’s turbidity, once stilled,
now flows pure?
Yet if one lingers too long in this clarity,
stagnation sets in—
unawakened, still unmanifest—
then they must pursue even greater methods,
stirring and refining their practice,
as the **Dao**’s essence is both diminished and restored,
and actions arise then fade away—
so the pure nature does not stagnate in **Dao**,
but moves forth gently.

**Meaning:** The Great **Dao** delights in birth,
luring people with its teachings.
Through myriad methods, one refines their nature,
through myriad practices, one cultivates their heart—
awakening leads to practice, practice leads to realization.
The principles of cultivation and realization,
broadly outlined,
include breathing the primal harmony,
swallowing and rinsing the celestial fluid,
eating pine and chewing bark,
forsaking grains to nourish on fungi.
Some retreat to the **Upper Celestial**,
secretly watching the **Mysterious Dipper**,
some forge **Five Metals** and **Eight Stones**,
some purify **Water Jade** and **Flowing Pearls**,
employing **Yin Cauldron** and **Yang Furnace**,
through **Five Phases** and **Nine Transformations**.
Some compose **Pure Texts** and **Elixir Scrolls**,
summoning spirits with **Golden Buttons** and **Green Threads**,
pledging oaths to heaven and earth—
then there are the **Orthodox Unity** of **Dao**,
the **Ascending Mysterious** and **Nurturing Spirit**,
the **Soul Treasure** and **Manifesting True**,
the **Three Celestials** and myriad **Dao**’s laws,
all discarding the mundane to attain the **Way**,
realizing the stages of **Dao**’s fruit.

There are also those who chase the **Two Sceneries**,
worship the **Five Celestial Stems**,
climb to the **Pole Star** and grasp the **Handle**,
soaring beyond the **Netherworld** and **Celestial Records**,
swallowing the sun and moon,
seizing the soul and binding the spirit,
gazing at the **Eight Paths** toward the clouds,
receiving the **Nine Truths**’s blessings,
ascending the **Mysterious** to rest in the **Dipper**,
dwelling in the **Hall of Perfection**,
left and right in **Spirit Flight**,
embracing **Yin** and **Yang** in the **Six Jia**,
the **Three Departments** and **Eight Sceneries**,
the **Twenty-Four Truths**,
preserving the **Three Elements**,
fixing the **Triple Unity**,
entering the **Purple Chamber** at the **Yellow Gate**,
beholding the **Vermilion Scene** in the **Red Cradle**.
The **Purple Void** scriptures of **Southern Peak**,
the **Green Boy**’s **□** [missing character] **East Sea** **Dao**,
internal gazing at the **Five Viscera**,
subduing the **Six Heavens** below,
guiding and inhaling the **Symbols**,
riding the wind to nourish the **qi**—
the methods of soaring transcend the **True Scripture**,
and some may attain the **Way** through a single practice,
thus able to rescue the **Primordial Ancestor** from eternal night,
and fly their body through the **Great Void**,
crossing the **Nine Terraces** in an instant—
who would dare to shame the **Dao**’s worthies?
Or, with a glance, encompass the **Six Directions**—
who would dare to rival **Hongmeng**?

Yet the world’s great deluded ones cannot savor this,
and they say: *"The affairs of the immortals*
*are not sought through mere accumulation of learning."*
They also claim: *"Those who attain the **Way***
*all have a set lifespan,*
*when their fate is exhausted, they sink back into decay."*
But they fail to know—
those who attain the **Way** naturally ascend to immortality,
from immortality realize **Sainthood**,
ascend to **Sainthood**’s ultimate fruit,
and merge with the **Way**’s true essence—
no span of life is measured,
no fate is exhausted—
in a breath, they traverse billions of **kalpas**,
with a gesture, they surpass ten thousand heavens.
The *Wen Xuan* says: *"A brief parting of a thousand years,*
*a fleeting journey of ten thousand miles."*
The *Step-on-the-Void Words* declare: *"The Eight Heavens span a finger’s reach,*
*the Six Directions are but a palm’s breadth."*
All are their deeds.

But when practice is attained,
one forgets its cultivation—
cultivation and forgetting alternate,
without lingering or attachment—
this is the marvel.

The **Dao** is what the **methods** elucidate,
yet realizing the **Dao** means forgetting the **methods**.
Words are what the **mind** observes,
yet grasping the **mind** means forgetting the words.
If one lingers in the **methods**,
the **Dao** cannot flow freely.

「If one lingers in **words**,
then the **mind** cannot be fully realized.

Thus, when one does not cling to the **methods**,
one turns to deeper cultivation,
and when one does not cling to **words**,
one renews understanding and insight.

*"Successive arising and successive extinction"*—
the *Sutra of the Western Ascension* states:
*"If you can follow the practice,*
*then successive arising and successive extinction."*

This analogy illustrates the **Hinayana**’s conditioned **dharma**,
used to instruct beginners.
Once the door is obtained,
gradually apply **Mahayana**’s intermediate **dharma**,
to refine the practice.
When the practice is refined,
then apply the **Mahayana**’s ultimate **dharma**,
to abandon fixation—
thus, the ordinary attain realization,
layered realizations ascend to sainthood.
Though the fruits of **sainthood** and **Dao** attainment span twenty-seven grades,
the practiced **deeds** must not be clung to or fixed upon—
this is the meaning of *"gradual growth and gradual purity, successive arising and successive extinction."*

Those who uphold this **Dao** do not wish to be full.

**Note:** To preserve this **Dao** of gradual purity and gradual growth,
one must cling to nothing.
If one fixates on purity and seeks life,
this is called **excess**—
one will lose this **Dao**.

Thus it is said: *"Do not wish to be full."*

**Commentary:** Lingering in **methods** and fixating on purity
is what is called **excess**.
Thus, if one wishes to fully preserve this **Dao** of gradual purity and gradual growth,
one must not cling to anything,
and attain **non-attainment**.

Now, if one lingers in purity while seeking life,
this is damaging **excess**.
**Excess** obstructs the **Dao**—
thus it is said: *"Do not wish to be full."*

**Explication:** The ability to grasp the **dharma** of successive arising and successive extinction
is the key to attaining the essence of gradual purity and gradual growth.
To uphold this principle,
one must not be fixed in **excess**—
this aligns with the reasoning of the following verse.

Only those who are not full
can thus avoid **newly attained** fixations.

**Note:** Only those who do not cling to **excess**
can continually apply newly realized **dharma**,
considering their **deeds** as insufficient,
not fixating on their **new attainments**.

**Commentary:** Those who can abandon all desire and fixation,
reaching the state of **non-doing** (*wuwei*),
and do not cling to or become full of the **dharma**,
always regard their newly realized **dharma** as **imperfect**,
seeking higher attainment—
not fixating on their **newly attained** state.

**Explication:** Having mastered old **methods**,
one attains new **dharma**.
This refers to entering the **intermediate vehicle** from the **Hinayana**.

The **intermediate vehicle**’s **Dao** is either provisional or real—
still, one lingers in practice.
Abandoning this provisional and real path of practice,
one seeks entry into the **ultimate vehicle**’s **non-doing** realm.
If one fixates on practice,
not realizing **non-doing**,
this is called **new attainment**—
yet it remains **excess**, and one will lose the **Dao**.
Thus, one must diminish it again and again,
ascending from coarse to subtle.

As for governance—
the ancient **sage-rulers** and virtuous ministers,
called *"skilled officials"* (*shànwéi shìzhě*),
were **profoundly** in harmony with **Dao** and **virtue**,
their **virtue** beyond measure.

Yet they were still like one crossing a river in winter,
fearing the ice—
trepidatious of neighboring states’ taboos,
as if a guest in **non-doing**,
adapting to circumstances, following the people,
flexing and extending without fixation,
and the ice melts.
Their **virtue** was vast as a valley,
their embrace pure and simple.

To govern with **Dao**—
though outwardly **impure**,
the heart is **pure** and inwardly luminous,
without the **Dao**’s obstruction of **excess** or arrogance,
upholding the rule of **imperfection** without **new attainment**—
their lineage will endure through the **great floods** (*yánhóng*),
and the people will thrive in **serenity and peace**.

The traces of **ancient purity**—
how distant are they?

**Chapter Sixteen: *Zhì Xūjí* – "Extending to the Ultimate Void"**

**Exegesis:**

The preceding chapter illuminated the **Dao**-communing sage, ever preserving the **Way** yet never replete. This chapter expounds upon those who cultivate stillness, returning to their root and restoring their vital breath—restoring breath being the key to knowing constancy, while guarding stillness is the path to attaining the Void.

The text unfolds in sequence, revealing that though principles converge in the practice of the **Dao**, knowing constancy brings clarity, and walking the **Dao** ensures endurance.

**Exposition:**

In the prior chapter, we saw the **Dao**-aligned sage embodying the gradual, tranquil generation of **virtue**. Here, we turn to the constancy of returning to one’s root and restoring breath.

Though one may govern as a sovereign, one must align with Heaven and embody the **Dao**; embodying the **Dao** ensures longevity, thus averting peril.

**Extending to the Ultimate Void**—
**Guarding stillness** with unwavering devotion.

**Annotation:**
*"Extending to the Ultimate Void"*—this is the **Mystic Source**.
It is said that all human life originates from this **Ultimate Void**, this **Mystic Source**. Yet once form receives and assimilates, the **Mystic Source** scatters. To restore the **Ultimate Void** within oneself, one must sever all entanglements with the profane world, steadfastly preserving this **feminine stillness** with depth and sincerity—then the **Dao** of the **Ultimate Void** will naturally manifest within.

**Exegesis:**
*"Extending to the Ultimate Void"*—this is the **Mystic Source** of the **Dao**.
Human life originates from the **Dao** as its foundation. That which is received is pure, untrammelled, and free of defilement—hence, it is called *"the Rectified."* Yet after birth, this Rectified nature drifts into error, becomes stained by worldly habits, and loses itself in mundane existence. The **Dao** is abandoned, and delusion encroaches daily.

The **Venerable Master Lao** admonishes: *"Those who cultivate the **Dao** must extinguish the impulses of desire and return to the profound stillness, only then may they govern the **Dao** of the **Ultimate Void**."*

**Annotation:**
*"Devotion"* means *"depth."*

**Exegesis:**
After birth, the six senses are stained, and the five desires contend—thus the Rectified nature scatters, and the **Mystic Source** is lost.

**Exposition:**
The nature received from the **Dao** is inherently pure and still. Yet after birth, it becomes obscured by defilements, clouding the mind and obscuring the true **Way**.

The six senses are:
1. The **eye-sense**, perceiving all forms;
2. The **ear-sense**, hearing all sounds;
3. The **mind-sense**, generating attachment and speculation;
4. The **nose-sense**, discerning aromas and foul odors;
5. The **tongue-sense**, tasting flavors;
6. The **body-sense**, experiencing afflictions.

From these six arise all karmic causes, cyclically generating and obscuring the true nature—
like plants bearing flowers and fruit, endlessly proliferating, yet all originating from these six roots, hence called the *"six senses."*

The five desires are:
- The **eye’s** desire for colors,
- The **ear’s** for sounds,
- The **nose’s** for fragrances,
- The **mouth’s** for tastes,
- The **heart’s** for myriad cravings.

These obstruct the five faculties, entangling in afflictions—all arising from here.
When the inner heart is pleased, it is called *love*.
When external objects seize the mind, it is called *staining*.
When objects evoke the mind, it is called *desire*.
When desire is not restrained, it is called *rampant*.
When thoughts and speculations invade, it is called *contention*.
Thus the Rectified nature disperses, and with each thought, evil arises. Because evil arises, the true root is abandoned.

**Exegesis:**
To restore the **Ultimate Void** and the **Mystic Source** within oneself, one must preserve this **feminine, still, profound, and sincere** nature while severing desire—neither constricting nor indulging—then the **Mystic Source** will naturally manifest.

**Exposition:**
When thoughts generate evil, it is said one has lost the **Dao**. To restore the **Mystic Dao** within, one must cultivate **feminine, steadfast, and tranquil** conduct, nurturing a **profound, sincere, and serene** nature to govern one’s passions.

Passions are the *branches*; nature is the *root*.
If nature generates passions, they follow objects as desires.
If passions nourish nature, they still the mind and return to the Origin.
Returning to the Origin, the five desires do not arise, the six senses remain undisturbed—
neither constricting the breath nor narrowing the heart—
then the **Dao** of the **Mystic Source** will naturally manifest within.

*"Neither constricting one’s dwelling nor satiating one’s birth"*—
words from *Chapter Thirty-Four* of the *De Jing*.

The *Xī Shēng Jīng* states:
*"When the heart is void, harmonious breath returns."*

**Exegesis:**
This is also like water flowing to dampness, fire drawn to dryness.

*"Extending"* means to let it come of its own accord—
as in *The Spring and Autumn Annals*, where *"extending"* refers to summoning troops.

**Exposition:**
Water and fire are senseless yet respond to their nature—
water flows to dampness, fire consumes dryness.
Even without awareness or sentiment, they respond thus.
How much more so should a void heart and tranquil contemplation attract the **Dao**?
It will come without seeking.

*"Extending troops"*—from *The Spring and Autumn Annals*, *Year Twelve of Duke Xiang*:
When the King of Chu besieged Zheng for seventeen days, the people of Zheng divined for surrender, but it was inauspicious. The citizens gathered in mourning, and the King of Chu withdrew his forces. The people of Zheng then repaired their city walls.

The siege lasted three months, and Zheng was captured. The Marquis of Zheng, bare-chested and leading a sheep, went to meet the King of Chu, who then agreed to peace. Pan Nang entered into the alliance, and Zi Liang was sent as a hostage. In the sixth month of summer, the army of Jin came to rescue Zheng. At the border of Enhuo, the King of Chu sought peace with Jin, and an alliance was agreed upon for a set day.

The King of Chu appointed Gu Yu as charioteer and Le Bo as right-hand warrior, with She Shu as his driver, intending to challenge Jin in single combat to feign unwillingness to make peace and provoke the Jin army. Gu Yu said, *"I have heard that to provoke an army, one should drive the chariot without flags or whips and return."* Le Bo said, *"To provoke an army, one should shoot an arrow to the left with a bow, then exchange places with the charioteer to hold the reins, descend from the chariot, strike the horses, and return."* She Shu said, *"To provoke an army, one should enter the enemy camp on the right, cut off the enemy’s banner, and return with captives beheaded."* Each acted according to what they had heard and returned.

The Jin army pursued them. Le Bo shot the horses on the left and the men on the right, driving them back so they could not advance. At that time, Wei Xie and Zhao Zhan bore grudges against Jin and requested envoys to Chu, all hoping for Jin’s defeat. Ji Zi also failed to prepare defenses, and at Qi, the Jin army was utterly defeated.

Thus, to provoke an army leads to enmity. Likewise, if one seeks the Dao through stillness, the Dao must be attainable.

When all things move in concert, I observe their return.
**Commentary:** The Venerable Master asks: How does one know that by guarding this feminine stillness, one can attain the utmost emptiness? Simply observe how all things move and act, and how they return—this is always rooted in stillness, and thus it is known.

**Exposition:** This clarifies that steadfastly guarding stillness will surely lead to the utmost emptiness. All things, in their myriad forms and movements, return to their origin. Meaning: Though things move and act in countless ways, they inevitably return to their source. If one cultivates an empty heart and contemplates the Dao, the Dao will gather within that emptiness. Hence, the warning to maintain an empty heart and ponder the Dao.

**Exposition:** The *Classic of Changes* says: *"Thunder returns within the earth."* Returning refers to restoring to one’s origin. Thus, stillness brings return, while movement loses its root. Meaning: The *Classic of Changes*’ *Hexagram of Returning* states: *"Thunder returns within the earth."* Thunder is a moving force, and the hexagram emphasizes the cessation of movement, hence *"thunder within the earth."* The ancient kings, on the winter solstice, closed the gates, halted commerce, and did not inspect the provinces—all to embody the principle of movement’s cessation and restore to the root.

When all things move in concert, that is movement;
Observing their return is stillness.
If one moves when stillness is due and stirs when stillness is required,
then one loses the root.

All things, teeming and thriving, each return to their origin.
**Commentary:** It is also said that one knows all things return to stillness because, though flowers and leaves teem and flourish, their nature is to return to their roots. Some say *"thus and so"*—that is, movement and action. It means that all things, though teeming in movement, return to their roots in the end.

**Exposition:** This uses analogy to clarify the meaning of observing return. The root is where one receives *qi* and gives birth. Now, observe how all things—flowers, leaves, and teeming growth—by their very nature return to their roots to regenerate. Meaning: *Ke yun* (芸芸) describes lush abundance. All grasses and trees, teeming and flourishing, wither and fall, then return to their roots to regrow and flourish anew. Returning to the root is returning to stillness. This is the natural principle of all things.

Humans receive the Dao and are born, their source pure and still. Once born into the world, desires and ambitions drag them—beauty and ugliness, prosperity and decline, wealth and poverty, myriad paths and countless schemes—wearing out the body and exhausting the spirit. Some overturn the earth and heaven, wielding extraordinary might; others establish deeds and achievements, earning names unmatched in the age.

Some bear the celestial cauldron and uproot mountains, others stretch iron hooks to draw the heavens;
some ride swift chariots with sleek steeds, others ride in lofty carriages with crimson wheels.
Their influence eclipses that of the **Xǔ Shǐ Jīn Zhāng** (许史金张)—the mighty and noble—
and their splendor surpasses the **Wǔ Hóu Qī Guì** (五侯七贵)—the five marquises and seven exalted houses.
Yet even the most flourishing of all must, when their fate is spent and their power shifts,
suddenly become mere mounds of earth.

This is returning to the root and attaining stillness.

If one can renounce worldly glory and truly comprehend the transient nature of splendor,
emptying the mind and nurturing the **spirit** (*shén* 神),
quieting the thoughts and pondering the Dao/Way,
why could they not attain the Dao/Way?

**Commentary:** The **Mystic Origin** (*xiūjí miàoběn* 虚极妙本) is what humans inherit and by which they are born.
Now, observe how **lustful desires** (*xìngyù xīxī* 性欲熙熙) flourish;
if one can preserve stillness and attain emptiness,
then one aligns with their true nature,
restores their inherent vitality (*mìngguāng* 命光),
and achieves lasting endurance.

The preceding words are explained as follows:
**Familiar abundance** (*xīxī*) signifies carefree joy.
Humans’ passions and desires flourish like blooming flowers and verdant leaves.
When luxuriance is at its peak, it soon withers and falls;
when desires are unrestrained, they inevitably harm life.
Thus, one must abandon desires and close the heart
to return to the Dao/Way.

The words above may also describe **multitude** (*qúnshù* 群数).
Returning to the root is stillness; stillness is restoring vitality (*fù mìng* 复命).

**Note:** Flowers and leaves—when their nature returns to the root, they cease in motion.
Humans who return to the root and attain perfect stillness
can be said to restore their inherited vitality (*xìngmìng* 性命).

**Commentary:** All things return to their roots and find peace;
humans who uphold stillness attain emptiness.
What humans inherit to be born is the **Mystic Origin** (*miàoběn* 妙本).
If they can uphold stillness and attain emptiness,
they restore their vitality (*fù mìng* 复命),
and this is called attaining the **Constant** (*cháng* 常).

**Commentary:** Those who can guard **feminine stillness** (*cíjìng* 雌静) with sincerity and depth,
attaining emptiness and the **Mystic Origin** (*miàoběn*),
restore their vitality (*fù mìng*) and attain the **Constant** (*cháng*).

The meaning is:
Abandoning passions and guarding **harmony** (*chōnghé* 冲和),
one returns to the **original teaching** (*zhāngshǒu* 章首)—
emptiness and stillness—
and thereby attains the **Constant**.

Knowing the **Constant** is called **clarity** (*míng* 明).

**Note:** Guarding stillness and restoring vitality is attaining the **Constant**.
Those who know and guard the **Constant** grow ever more enlightened.

**Note:** Those who do not uphold their **virtue/power** (*dé* 德) may invite shame.
**Commentary:** Losing the **Constant** and acting recklessly is extreme folly (*qióngxiōng* 穷凶).
**Commentary:** Those who know and uphold the **Constant** are enlightened (*míngliǎo* 明了).
Losing the **Constant** and acting recklessly is called **lacking constancy** (*wúhéng* 无恒).
Those who lack constancy in their **virtue/power** (*dé* 德) must surely invite extreme folly (*qióngxiōng* 穷凶).

The **Book of Changes** (*Yì* 易) states in the **Héng** (恒) hexagram:
*"Those who do not uphold their **virtue/power** (*dé* 德) may invite shame."*
**Héng** (恒) is the **Constant**.
To be in a position without moderation,
to advance and retreat without certainty—
though one may dwell in the **Héng** (恒) hexagram,
they defy its essence (*héngtǐ* 恒体),
and thus are truly shameful and wicked,
hence *"may invite shame."*

The **Appended Images** (*Xiàng* 象) say:
*"Those who do not uphold their **virtue/power** (*dé* 德) have no place to dwell."*
Knowing the **Constant** (*zhī cháng* 知常) is called **clarity** (*míng* 明).
**Clarity** (*míng*) discerns all things,
and when things come, they must respond—
nothing is excluded from its embrace (*hánróng* 含弘).
Thus it is said: *"Knowing the **Constant** (*cháng*) is called **clarity** (*míng*)."*

The meaning is:
Upholding the **Constant** (*cháng*) in one’s **virtue/power** (*dé* 德)
is to have nothing excluded—
this is the opposite of the earlier **Appended Images** (*Xiàng* 象).
Attaining the **Constant** and embodying the Dao/Way,
one’s **mystic insight** (*xuānjiàn* 玄鉴) leaves nothing behind.
Responding to things in accordance with the **Constant**,
one’s embrace (*hánróng* 含弘) is vast and luminous.

**Embrace** (*róng* 容) is **impartiality** (*gōng* 公).
**Note:** To embrace all things and respond without bias,
to respond without personal scheming—
this is **impartiality** (*gōngzhèng* 公正), free from private or perverse motives.

**Impartiality** (*gōng* 公) is **sovereignty** (*wáng* 王).
**Note:** Those who are impartial and without private motives
are the ones all things naturally turn toward.

**Commentary:** To embrace all things and respond without bias
is to be impartial and without private motives—
then the world turns toward them,
and this is called **sovereignty** (*wáng* 王).

The meaning is:
Knowing the **Constant** and following the Dao/Way,
one attains **impartiality** (*gōngzhèng* 公正)
and thereby becomes **sovereign** (*wáng* 王).
The **sovereign** (*wáng*) does not speak yet transforms,
does not summon yet comes—
thus the world turns toward them.

**Sovereignty** (*wáng* 王) is the **Dao** of the world (*shì* 世).
**Note:** All things joyfully submit,
as if to the sky’s embrace—
thus they align with the **virtue/power** (*dé* 德) of the **Heavenly** (*tiān* 天).

The **Heavenly** (*tiān* 天) is the **Dao** (*dào* 道).
**Note:** The **sovereign’s virtue/power** (*wángdé* 王德) is like the **Heavenly** (*tiān* 天),
and thus they embody the Dao/Way (*dàohuà* 道化).

**Commentary:** Only the **Heavenly** (*tiān* 天) is great,
and only the **sovereign** (*wáng* 王) follows its pattern.
Their **virtue/power** (*dé* 德) is the same as the **Heavenly** (*tiān* 天),
and nothing is left uncovered—
hence *"**sovereignty** is **Heavenly**."*
The **sovereign’s virtue/power** (*wángdé* 王德) aligns with the **Heavenly** (*tiān* 天),
and thus they govern without action (*wúwéi* 无为).
The Dao/Way’s transformations (*huà* 化) are carried out—
hence *"the **Heavenly** is the **Dao**."*

The meaning is:
To have all things turn toward one,
is to nurture the myriad realms (*zǐyù wànfāng* 子育万方),
and declare to the **Supreme Sovereign** (*shàngdì*上帝).
To follow the **Heavenly** (*tiān* 天) in vast embrace,
to follow the **Earthly** (*dì* 地) in effortless governance (*wúwéi* 无为).
The **sovereign** follows the **Heavenly** (*tiān* 天),
and the **Heavenly** follows the **Dao** (*dào* 道).

The **Dao** (*dào* 道) is **enduring** (*jiǔ* 久).
**Note:** The Dao/Way is carried out under the **Heavenly** (*tiān* 天),
and thus one can enjoy enduring blessings (*fúzuò* 福祚).
**Note:** To align with the **Heavenly** and embody the Dao/Way,
one’s life may end, yet their vitality is unharmed (*bùdài* 不殆).

**Commentary:** It is said that guarding stillness and attaining emptiness,
returning to the root and restoring vitality (*fù mìng* 复命),
their **virtue/power** (*dé* 德) is thus—
they can become **sovereign** (*wáng* 王).
The **sovereign’s virtue/power** (*wángdé* 王德) aligns with the **Heavenly** (*tiān* 天),
and thus they embody the Dao/Way.
The Dao/Way is carried out, and this is enduring blessings (*jiǔxiǎng fúzuò* 久享福祚).
All under the **Heavenly** (*tiān* 天) flock toward them like the sun,
revere them like the sky,
nurture them like the rain,
and await them like the spring—
thus, when their life ends, what danger or harm can there be?
Hence *"their vitality is unharmed."*

This teaching speaks of how a sovereign accumulates **virtue/power** (*dé*).

Though a sovereign may enjoy peace, hold the reins of governance, and rule over the people,
if they stray from **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**, how could they endure long?
Thus, they must first empty their mind,
then guard their stillness.
When emptiness and stillness bring forth the **Dao/Way**, they return to their natural state,
and thus act with impartiality and without selfishness—
the people flock to them,
their actions align with **Heaven** and the **Dao/Way**.

When the **Dao/Way** is practiced to transform the people,
and its transformation spreads widely,
all under **Heaven** rejoice and revere them,
and so they endure blessings and longevity without danger or harm—
like the sun’s radiant presence,
like the sky’s nurturing embrace,
like rain’s nourishing dew,
like spring’s gentle warmth.
Though their life may end,
their **virtue/power** does not fade.

Thus do people today sing of Yao and Shun,
and celebrate Xī and Nóng through music and dance.

*"Revered like the sky, drawn to like the sun"*—
this is the **virtue/power** of Yao.

Narrated by Master Du Guangting of the Tang,
*"The Supreme Sovereign’s Chapter of Knowing Below"* (第十七)

「Commentary: This chapter first discusses the pure customs of antiquity, then extends to the corrupt habits of the later ages, intending to clarify the gradual loss of the Dao/Way and to analyze the origins of its decline. Hence, the previous chapter expounded that guarding stillness leads to attaining emptiness, while this chapter demonstrates that non-action returns one to simplicity. When simplicity disperses, the praise of virtue naturally arises; when non-action is practiced, it is said that "I act naturally." The common people’s rulers who embody the Dao/Way rely solely on this silent teaching.

**Meaning:** In the Supreme Ancient Age and the Great Ancient Age, there was no governance or artificial intervention; the ruler entrusted himself to nature, and the people embraced the Great Simplicity. The Supreme Ancient Age refers to the very beginning of Heaven and Earth. *Liézǐ* states: "In ancient times, the Sage followed the interplay of yin and yang to harmonize Heaven and Earth, thus giving rise to form from the formless." Therefore, before Heaven and Earth, there was the **Supreme Ease** (太易), where *qi* had not yet appeared; then the **Supreme Beginning** (太初), where *qi* first emerged; then the **Supreme Commencement** (太始), where form first took shape; and finally the **Supreme Purity** (太素), where matter first solidified. Collectively, these are called the **Supreme Pole** (太极), hence the term "Five Supremes" (五太) for the Supreme Ancient Age. When *qi*, form, and matter were all present but not yet separated, it was called **Hun Dun** (混沌), indicating that all things were in a state of undifferentiated chaos. Later, Hun Dun separated: the light and pure ascended as Heaven, the heavy and turbid descended as Earth, thus establishing the division of above and below and fixing yin and yang. Human beings received the harmonious *qi* of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang, dwelling between them, illuminated by the sun and moon, shaped by cosmic phenomena, nurtured by yin and yang, and regulated by cold and heat. Alongside Heaven and Earth, they were collectively called the **Three Talents** (三才). The **Three Sovereigns of the Highest Age**, the **Three Sovereigns of the Middle Age**, and the **Three Sovereigns of the Lower Age** successively governed and shepherded the people—this is what is called the Great Ancient Age.

Heaven’s duty was to nurture life, Earth’s duty was to bear form, the Sage’s duty was to teach and transform, and all things fulfilled their natural roles in this cycle of generation and transformation. Initially, they relied on **Dao/Way and Virtue/Power**; later, they turned to **ren and yì** (仁義). Thus, excessive praise and fear of blame arose, and trust in benevolence and sincerity waned, necessitating a return to ancient simplicity and the restoration of pure harmony. In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, during the twenty-fourth year of Duke Lǐ (僖公), King Zhou of the Zhou wished to attack Zheng with the help of the Di tribesmen, but Fù Chén advised: "The most exalted ruler governs by **virtue/power**, without distinction between near and far. The next level favors the near and extends to the far. This means first treating the near with affection and then extending benevolence to the far, thereby establishing righteousness." The most exalted ruler—this is what "knowing below" (下知) refers to.

**Annotation:** The exalted ruler is the pure ancient sovereign. "Knowing below" (下知) means that the ministers only know their lord exists above them, revering him like Heaven, yet without any trace of artificial governance or instruction. Thus, the people have no way to praise him. **Commentary:** The exalted ruler is the pure ancient sovereign. "Exalted" (太上) signifies supreme reverence. It describes the sovereign of the Supreme Ancient Age who engaged in non-action and practiced silent teaching. Ministers merely knew that their lord was above them, great and high, embodying the principle of nurturing all things through the four seasons. They did not know how to name his **virtue/power**, hence the saying "knowing below" (下知有之). **Meaning:** *Tài* (太) means great, and *shàng* (上) means high. The name "Supreme Sovereign" (太上) reflects his ultimate greatness and elevation. The rulers of the Great Ancient Age had no posthumous titles; they cultivated pure and thick harmony to transform the people, acting without coercion and letting their **virtue/power** naturally permeate. They did not impose laws or punishments to sway the hearts of the people. Thus, ministers knew their lord was above them but did not hear his commands or instructions. His dwelling was serene, his rising was unhurried, his movements were measured, and his gaze was distant. Mountains had no paths carved through them, marshes had no bridges built across them. People ate what they cultivated and wore what they wove, while the four seasons followed their course above and all things flourished below. His **virtue/power** was profound and distant, beyond naming, hence "Supreme Sovereign" (太上).

Some say the sovereigns of the Supreme Ancient Age and Great Ancient Age included the **Clans of Róngchéng** (容成氏), **Dàtíng** (大庭氏), **Fǔ** (栢氏), **Zhōngyāng** (中央氏), **Lǐlù** (栗陆氏), **Lìlián** (丽连氏), **Xuānyuán** (轩辕氏), **Hèxiū** (赫胥氏), **Wúhuái** (无怀氏), **Hàoyīng** (昊英氏), **Zūnlú** (尊卢氏), **Gětīan** (葛天氏), **Yīnyīng** (阴襄氏), **Zhùróng** (祝融氏), **Lièshān** (列山氏), **Fúxī** (伏羲氏), and **Shénnóng** (神农氏)—all belonging to the age of knotted cords and non-action. The **Yellow Emperor** (黄帝) was the second son of the sovereign of the **Clan of Xióng** (有熊国), surnamed **Gōngsūn** (公孙氏). From birth, he was divine and intelligent, and as he grew, he became earnest and wise. His mother, **Jiāo Shì** (乔氏), named **Fùbǎo** (附宝), saw the radiance of lightning encircle the Northern Dipper and the **Pivot Star** (枢星) illuminate the wilds, and was thus conceived. Fourteen months later, the Yellow Emperor was born. When the **virtue/power** of Shénnóng declined and **Chīyóu** (蚩尤) became tyrannical, the feudal lords launched invasions. The Yellow Emperor cultivated his **virtue/power**, raised an army, and defeated Chīyóu in the wilds of **Zhuólù** (涿鹿). The people revered him and established him as the **Son of Heaven**, naming him the Yellow Emperor, to succeed Shénnóng.

He **Mastered Du Guangtíng** (广成子) taught on the **Kōngtóng Mountain** (崆峒山), imparting the principles of governance. He extracted the essence of Heaven and Earth to nourish the myriad people. He invented writing, domesticated cattle and horses, and introduced boats and carriages. He created pestles and mortars, palaces and dwellings, bows and arrows, and regulated the **lǘ** (律吕) [musical pitch pipes]. He cast tripods and crafted zithers.

His dwelling bore the **auspicious sign of the *Zhēnyún* Cloud** (缙云), and sometimes he was called the *Zhēnyún* Clan (缙云氏), marking his officials by the **cloud insignia** (以云纪官). When the rites and music were established, his minister **Dàyuǎo** (大挠) created the calendar, **Róngchéng** (容成) devised calculations, **Cāngjié** (仓颉) invented writing, **Fēnghòu** (风后) forged the five weapons, and **Wànlǜ** (万虑) and others made their marks known. The Emperor rode upon a **flying dragon** (飞龙), traversing the four seas and all the great mountains and rivers, leaving traces everywhere.

Then, he took the copper from **Chóushǒu Mountain** (首山), casting the **tripod** (鼎) at **Jīngshān** (荆山) to blend the **nine elixirs** (九丹). When the elixir was complete, a dragon with **pendant whiskers** (垂胡髯) descended to greet him. The Yellow Emperor ascended upon the **Yellow Dragon** (黄龙) and departed to Heaven. Among his great ministers, **seventy-two** (七十二) ascended with him, while lesser officials, some clinging to the dragon’s whiskers and falling, others wailing while clutching the Emperor’s bow, were thus called **Bird-Wailing Bow** (鸟号弓). The place where he ascended to Heaven is now **Huángtiān Yuán** (皇天原) in **Guó State** (虢州), also known as **Dǐng Lake** (鼎湖).

The Emperor **Yáo** (尧) harmonized the **nine clans** (九族) and cherished the common folk. He was taught by **Mùchéngzǐ** (务成子), regulating the seasons, standardizing the **lǘ** (律吕) and measures, and thus transforming the realm. The Emperor **Shùn** (舜) was instructed by **Yǐnshòuzǐ** (尹寿子), whose **filial virtue** (孝德) shone brightly, allowing him to succeed Yáo as the Son of Heaven. His biography is detailed in the **third chapter** (第三章).

The Yellow Emperor, Yáo, and Shùn established laws and measures, and the people, moved by their **virtue/power** (德), praised their deeds—this was **true praise** (真誉). It was not that the Yellow Emperor, Yáo, and Shùn forced the people to praise them; rather, the people **voluntarily** (自) praised them. Later generations were not so. They **emulated and falsified** (矫) the traces of the past, giving rise to **deceptive praise** (矫誉) and **plagiarized virtue** (矫亲), thus fostering the **calamity of false pretenses** (矫窃之患).

**Cushion:** (疏) Therefore, *Zhuāngzi* says: *"I tell you, the root of great chaos must arise between the ages of Yáo and Shùn."* Why so? Because their **legacies** (迹) endure a thousand years later. The meaning is: the **traces of true praise and virtue** (亲誉之迹) began with the Yellow Emperor, Yáo, and Shùn, but a thousand years on, people **coveted their legacy** (慕其迹), leading to **deception and flattery** (矫徇).

In *Zhuāngzi*, **Gēngsāng Chǔ** (庚桑楚) told his disciples: *"What is there to commend in Yáo and Shùn? They **passed the throne through mutual respect and yielding** (揖让相禅), and later generations **imitated their practice** (法). But when one **elevates the virtuous**, people **vie to compete**; when one **trusts the wise**, people **scheme to deceive**. Such methods **cannot truly benefit the people** (厚民). Sons **murder their fathers**, ministers **assassinate their rulers**, thieves **operate openly at midday**, and **bandits lurk in broad daylight** (日中穴阫). The root of great chaos must arise between the ages of Yáo and Shùn. Its **outcome** (末) lingers a thousand generations later, when people will **devour one another** (相食). This speaks of how **honoring the virtuous and trusting ability** (尊贤任能) eventually leads to **great corruption** (大弊), where **mutual encroachment** (更相蚕食) began in the **era of Táng and Yú** (唐虞之间). As **flattery and deception** (矫徇) never cease, people lose their **true nature** (真性), thus descending into great chaos.

Next, they **feared and scorned** (畏之侮之) them.

**Annotation:** (注) When **virtue/power** (德) declined, rulers multiplied **corrupt governance** (弊政), and the people **could not endure their fate** (不堪命), so they were **driven by punishments** (刑罚) and thus **feared** them. They **harbored resentful emotions** (怀情) and **deceived one another** (相欺), while rulers **lacked insight** (明不能察), so they were **scorned**.

**Cushion:** (疏) After the Yellow Emperor, Yáo, and Shùn passed away, the **Three Sovereigns** (三王) and **Five Hegemons** (五霸) followed. Gradually, **harsh laws and severe punishments** (严刑峻制) grew, so the people **feared** them. Rulers **lacked insight** (明不能察), so they were **scorned**. Inferior officials **fabricated crimes to seek rewards** (下议罪而求功), while superiors **granted favors to the deceitful** (上赏奸而生诈), leading to **mutual deception** (相蒙). This is enough to **chill the heart** (寒心).

The meaning is: After Yáo and Shùn died, the **Three Sovereigns** succeeded them. The **Three Sovereigns** are the **Xìa, Yīn, and Zhōu** (夏殷周). **Yǔ** (禹) of the **Xìa** (夏) bore the surname **Yú** (姓) and given name **Wénmìng** (文命), being the grandson of **Gāoyáng** (高阳). His mother was called **Xiūjǐ** (修己), and at the **stone knot of the mountain** (石纽山) below a spring, she **conceived from the moon’s essence** (得月精如鸡子) like a chicken’s egg, birthing Yǔ. His left hand bore the **character for water** (水字), and his right hand bore the **character for platform** (台字), together forming the **character for governance** (治字). Yǔ’s father, **Gǔn** (鲧), served Yáo in **draining the waters** (治水) for nine years, but his efforts **failed to complete the task** (绩用不成). Shùn **executed Gǔn at Yǔshān** (羽山), raised Yǔ to replace his father, and commanded him to **drain the waters**. Yǔ **dug the nine rivers** (通九江), **deepened the hundred streams** (浚百川), and when all the valleys were **harmonized** (百谷既同), the **four seas flowed without obstruction** (四海无壅). His **hands and feet were calloused** (手足胼胝), and he **dug through the Dragon Gate** (凿龙门), **cleared the pass at Yī** (辟伊阙), and **deepened the nine rivers**. In his travels, he **visited seven hundred states** (七百余国), riding the **four vehicles** (四载) to **inscribe the names of mountains and rivers** (奠名山大川), leaving no place unexplored.

As a man, his **benevolence** (仁) was **approachable** (可亲), his words **trustworthy** (可信). His **voice set the standard for pitch** (声为律), and his **person embodied measure** (身为度). He was taught by **Zhēnxíngzǐ** (真行子), who obtained the **Five Talismans of the Primordial Treasure** (太上灵宝五符), summoning **ghosts and spirits** (檄召鬼神) to **move mountains and block rivers** (移山塞川). After completing the **waterworks** (治水), Heaven **bestowed the dark jade** (玄珪) upon him as a **token of success** (告成功). Shùn then **transferred the throne** (禅位), creating the **nine tripods** (九鼎) and establishing the **nine regions** (九州). The **Five Sacred Mountains** (五岳) and named peaks were all **carved with inscriptions** (刻石科斗篆文), marking their **heights and depths** (以表其高下). He ruled for **forty-one years** (四十一年), reaching the age of **one hundred years** (一百岁). His descendants held the throne for **sixteen generations** (十六代), capitalizing at **Píngyáng** (平阳), beginning in the **year Gǎnghài** (癸亥) and ending in **year Jǐwèi** (己巳), for a total of **four hundred eighty-seven years** (四百八十七年).

Yǔ having abdicated, he himself deemed his virtue insufficient to match that of Yáo and Shùn, and thus relinquished the title of Emperor, assuming that of King—thereby becoming one of the **Three Sovereigns** (三王).

Later, Xià Jié’s tyranny led to **Táng of Yīn** rising as a vassal lord to overthrow Jié and assume his throne. Táng was a descendant of **Yì**, the seventeenth-generation grandson of **Huángdì**. His given name was **Lǚ**, also called **Tiānyǐ**. He aided Xià in conquering **Gěbó**, earning merit, and abolished the **three-sided net** (三面之网), returning thirty-six states to their virtuous rulers.

When Xià Jié’s cruelty provoked rebellion, Táng defeated him at **Míngtiáo**, exiling him to **Náncháo**, where a white wolf appeared as an auspicious omen. The **Supreme Lord** (太上) bestowed upon him the **Five Sacred Talismans** (五符), and he appointed **Yíyǒu** as his prime minister. During a seven-year drought, he offered his own body as a sacrifice, and Heaven sent great rains. The Four Seas praised his virtue. He ruled for thirteen years, reaching the age of one hundred and nineteen. His descendants held the throne for twenty-one generations, thirty kings, with their capital at **Bó**. He ascended the throne in the year **Gēngwǔ** after defeating Jié, and perished in **Yǐyǒu** when **Zhòu** arose, ruling for six hundred and fifty-six years—thus becoming the **second of the Three Sovereigns**.

Later, **Zhòu of Yīn**’s tyranny reached its height: he severed **Zhāoché’s** legs, pierced **Bǐgān’s** heart, instituted the **páo-luò torture**, and disemboweled pregnant women. The world rebelled. **Zhōu Xībó**, the Western Duke of Zhōu, dominated the region in **Dīngmǎo**, and his son, **Wǔwáng**, succeeded him in **Jǐmǎo**. In **Yǐyǒu**, he defeated Zhòu at **Mùyě**, vanquishing him and establishing the Zhōu dynasty in place of Yīn.

A descendant of **Hòulì**, surnamed **Jī**, Hòulì’s given name was **Qì**. His mother, **Jiānglìng**, was the favored consort of **Yúdì**. While walking in the wild, she saw the footprints of a giant, delighted, and stepped into them, conceiving. After a year, she bore him, fearing it an omen, and abandoned him in a ditch. Cattle and horses shied away, and he was moved to an icy patch, where birds sheltered him with their wings. Jiānglìng, believing him divine, raised him and named him **Qì**. As a child, he was fond of surveying landforms and excelled in agriculture. **Yáo** appointed him **Master of Agriculture**, and the world benefited. He was ennobled at **Hé**, earning the title **Hòulì**.

His tenth-generation descendant, **Gǔgōng Dànfù**, accumulated virtue and righteousness, and the people revered him. Dànfù married **Dàjiāng**, fathering **Jìlì**, who wed **Dàrèn**, producing **Wénwáng Chāng**. Chāng became the Western Duke. When **Zhòu of Yīn** suspected his virtue, he imprisoned him at **Yǔlǐ**. His minister **Húnqiú** sought the **black horse of Yǒuxiǒng**, the **maiden of Yǒushēn**, and exotic treasures to present to Zhòu. Zhòu pardoned the Western Duke, gifting him bows, arrows, axes, and battle-axes, granting him authority over military campaigns. The **Master of the Yellow Court** (老君) appeared on the southern slope of **Qíshān**, with the **bìnglì bird** as an omen. Two-thirds of the world’s people aligned with Zhōu’s virtue.

The Western Duke received the bow and arrows in **Dīngmǎo**, the twenty-first year of Zhòu’s reign. His son, **Wǔwáng**, defeated Zhòu in **Yǐyǒu**, assuming the throne. He released cattle into **Táolín** and returned horses to the southern slope of **Huáshān**, inverting weapons to show they would never be used again. With ten loyal ministers, he brought order to the realm. He ruled for nine years. **Wénwáng** lived to ninety-seven, **Wǔwáng** to ninety-three. His descendants held the throne for thirty-seven generations, forty-one kings, from **Yǐyǒu** to **Rángwáng** in **Rénzǐ**, ruling for eight hundred and sixty-eight years—thus becoming the **third of the Three Sovereigns**.

The **Five Hegemons** (五霸) operated within the Three Sovereigns’ era, among the vassal lords. They subdued the Four Quarters with arms, presided over alliances, internally supported the Son of Heaven, and externally intimidated the vassals. They wielded **ritual and music** in warfare, holding authority in their time but not equaling the Sovereigns, hence called **Hegemons**.

The Hegemons of Xià included **Kūnwú**, a descendant of **Huángdì**. Those of Yīn included **Dàpēng** and **Shǐwéi**, descendants of **Yáo**. The Hegemons of Zhōu included **Qí Huán**, the younger brother of **Lǐ Xīgōng**, named **Xiǎobái**. Established in **Lǔ Zhuānggōng’s** ninth year, he was advised by **Guān Zhòng**, uniting the vassals nine times and rectifying the world once—during the reigns of **Zhōu Huìwáng** and **Zhōu Xiāngwáng**.

**Jìn Wēngōng**, son of **Xiàngōng**, named **Zhòng’ěr**, was established in **Lǔ Xīgōng’s** twenty-second year. Fleeing **Lìjī’s** treachery in **Lǐ Xīgōng’s** fourth year, he wandered through **Qí, Cáo, Wèi, Chén, Chǔ, Zhèng, and Qín** for eighteen years. The **Qín Bó** restored him to Jìn with an army, and **Zhōu Xiāngwáng** bestowed the **Nine Sacrificial Offerings** (九锡): crimson bows and arrows, jade tablets, **gǔshèng wine**, and authority over the vassals. After teaching the people for two years, **Zǐfán** advised him to govern by righteousness. He first stabilized **Zhōu Xiāngwáng**, then prioritized the people’s welfare, attacking **Yuán** to demonstrate sincerity and **Sōu** to uphold ritual. Thereafter, he was employed. After defending **Gǔyù**, he lifted the siege of **Sòng**, conquering in a single battle to achieve hegemony. His success lay in his mastery of **ritual and wisdom**, wielding arms to secure dominance. His strength came from **mobilizing armies and forming alliances**—hence, **Hegemon** (霸) means to **grasp** (把), to **gather heroes and achieve might**.

**Virtue, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom** are the **Dao of warfare**. Harsh punishments bind the heart, stringent laws gag speech—yet the finer the laws, the more chaotic the people; the denser the nets, the greater the crimes. Disaster arises unnoticed, deceit flourishes unseen. Rulers and subjects deceive each other, inspiring fear in some, contempt in others. The **Dao-adherent** witnesses these dangers and trembles—**a chilling of the heart**.

In the *Chōngxū Zhēnjīng*, **Kǒngzǐ** spoke to **Shāng Tàizǎi**:
*The Three Sovereigns excelled in adapting to the times, aligning with nature, and governing.
The Five Emperors mastered **virtue and righteousness**, clarifying goodness to achieve success.
The Three Kings excelled in **wisdom and courage**, deciding with wisdom and acting with courage.
The Five Hegemons mastered **opportunity and strategy**, adapting to circumstances, leveraging advantage, and completing tasks—yet still constrained by ritual and bound by trust. When ritual or trust falters, the **Dao of the Hegemon** emerges.*

Trust proves insufficient, then distrust arises.
**Note:** Those who fear or scorn [the ruler] stem from the ruler’s lack of trustworthiness.
Thus, those beneath him become distrustful.

**Exegesis:** This explains why the people fear the ruler’s laws and scorn his decrees—all because the ruler lacks trust from below, causing those beneath him to be distrustful.

**Meaning:** When words are spoken but not kept, that is trust. Yet if rewards are given to the undeserving and punishments meted out to the innocent, that is distrust.
When decrees lose their trustworthiness, the people may deceive [the ruler] in return.

As a body bends, its shadow distorts; as a source is muddied, its flow becomes foul. The ruler sets the example, and those below follow suit—such is their response.

In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Xuan of Jin, Year 11, the Marquis of Chu attacked Zheng, reaching Liang. The Zheng minister Zi Liang said:
*"Chu and Jin do not uphold virtue but wage war. If they come, let them come.*
*Chu and Jin lack trust—how can we have trust?"*
And so Zheng sided with Chu.
In summer, the Marquis of Chu allied with Zheng at Chenling, displaying Zheng’s submission.
This was a case of trust proving insufficient, and distrust arising.
Yet even the noble value words.

「Annotations: *注* – A gloss explaining the reasoning behind the text.
*疏* – A commentary elaborating on the *注*’s interpretation.

The people who hold you in esteem and praise you—
it is because you possess **virtue/power** and **teachings** that are worthy of respect,
and thus they value your words and hold you in esteem and praise.

The common folk love and cherish your benevolence and goodness,
and acclaim your achievements and deeds—
this stems from your **virtue/power** and **teachings** that are worthy of respect,
so they honor your words and extol them.

*Ancient* **字 (zì)** and **由 (yóu)** were interchangeable in usage.

**Explanation:** If a ruler’s decrees are inconsistent,
the people fear his harshness.
If a ruler’s decrees are benevolent and good,
the people cherish and praise him.

The *Book of Documents* states:
*"The people’s hearts never waver—
they are steadfast when there is benevolence."*
And again:
*"If you nurture me, I will follow you;
if you oppress me, I will seek vengeance."*

Thus, the people despise his cruel and violent decrees,
and they honor his benevolent and virtuous teachings.

**犹 (yóu)** means *still*, *moreover*, or *follow*.
Ancient texts sometimes omitted characters,
so they were used interchangeably.

When achievements are fulfilled and undertakings accomplished,
the common folk say, *"It was done by nature."*

**Annotations:** *注* – When achievements are fulfilled without arrogance,
and undertakings accomplished without coercion,
the people go about their daily lives unaware,
saying, *"It was done by nature."*

This is how the **Dao/Way** of the *Tao Shang* [太上, Supreme Sage] is understood by those above and below alike.
**Commentary:** *疏* – This elaborates on the *Tao Shang*’s principle of non-action.

The pure and unadorned do not harm others—
who would then sacrifice them as vessels?
If **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way** are universally practiced,
praise and honor arise naturally.

Thus, in the age of the *Tao Shang*,
the land was so fertile that it required no tilling—
*抔抔 (póupóu)*, *步侯 (bùhóu)* [both variants of *不耕 (bùgēng)*].
Water flowed freely for drinking,
yet he did not favor his own kin,
nor did he show partiality to his own children.

The ruler had the merit of bringing life into being,
of completing and nurturing it,
yet he did not boast of this to those below.
When the people saw things in their proper place,
they did not know the ruler’s transformative **Dao/Way**,
but assumed it was simply the natural order.

The pure and unadorned do not harm others—
as the *Zhuangzi* [*Tianxia (天下) or *Ma Shui (马蹄)*] chapter says:
*"The pure and unadorned do not harm others—
who would then sacrifice them as vessels?
White jade left uncarved—
who would then shape it into ritual tablets?"*
If **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way** are not abandoned,
why seek after benevolence and righteousness?"

Emotions and innate nature remain undivided—
why then employ rites and music?

Colors do not stray—
who would then seek after patterns and dyes?
Sounds do not stray—
who would then conform to the six **Lü**?

To mar the pure and unadorned for vessels—
that is the artisan’s fault.
To abandon **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** for benevolence and righteousness—
that is the sage’s error.

The *Book of Liang* recounts Master **Du**’s explanation: In ancient times, ritual vessels were all carved from wood in the shapes of birds and beasts, with holes drilled in their heads and backs for pouring and receiving wine. In the **Wei** dynasty, a man found in the wilds of **Lu** County a **Ziwei** vessel belonging to a **Qi** official, shaped like a sacrificial cow. During the **Yongjia** era of the **Jin**, bandit **Cao Yi** raided the tomb of **Qi Jing Gong** in **Qing** State and uncovered two such vessels, also cow-shaped. Thus, it became known that all were ancient **Ziwei** designs.

In the **Great Ancient** age, the **Dao/Way** prevailed—
**virtue/power** was not yet **virtue/power**,
and people knew only that their ruler was a sovereign.
In the **Middle Ancient** age, the **Dao/Way** faded—
benevolence and **virtue/power** became apparent,
and kindness and grace extended to the people.
Thus arose the praise of personal favor.

In the **Later Ancient** age, **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** were both obscured—
teachings and commands grew convoluted,
faith and trust grew thin.
The ruler above lost trust,
and those below responded with distrust.
Thus, when they saw stern decrees, they feared them,
and when they heard of broken faith, they scorned them.

**Laozi**’s warnings sought to urge future emperors and kings
to discard the superficial trappings of rites and wisdom,
to emulate the ancient customs of **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**,
to abandon merit and forget fame,
and to return once more to the **Great Simplicity**.

Personal favor arises when—
there are traces of benevolence, they are called *personal*;
there are traces of goodness, they are called *favor*.
Reciprocal kindness is when—
the ruler bestows his grace, it is called *reciprocal*;
the people perform their labor, it is called *kindness*.

In the **24th year of Duke Lǔ** of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*,
King **Shuang** of **Zhou** sent the **Di** to attack **Zheng**, achieving success.
**Fu Chen** admonished the king:
*"Reciprocal kindness* leads to exhaustion,
*kindness* does not yet tire."
He spoke of the king’s labor and the people’s demands—
when labor is demanded, expectations for *reciprocal kindness* become excessive.

This was **Fu Chen**’s reproach to the king of **Zhou**,
who sought to attack **Zheng** out of resentment,
and who, after the **Di**’s victory, wished to wed his daughter as a reward.
The people’s daily needs, unrecognized—
that is the language of the *Zhouyi*.

The *Dao/Way* and **virtue/power**’s true essence, **Volume 16** of the *Guangshengyi* concludes.
**Volume 17** of the *Dao/Way* and **virtue/power**’s true essence, **Du Guangcheng**’s account of the **Tang** Master.

**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao in Decay**

**Exegesis:**
The previous chapter revealed how the Dao’s steps diverge with time—
yet the Dao endures, preserving its pristine simplicity.
This chapter reveals how customs decay and morals corrode—
when the Dao is lost, *ren* and *yi* arise in its place.
Like one bald yet seeking hair to adorn,
or sick yet seeking medicine for cure—
though they claim to heal, they only worsen the affliction.
Thus, eight lines are cited to expose their accumulated harm,
hoping to swiftly restore the ancient purity.

**Explanation:**
Earlier, the pure and simple gradually dispersed,
while the vulgar and shallow took root.
Tracing the source of this corruption,
we see the Dao’s decline.
The *Way* of the Sage moves gently with the natural order,
while the *Way* of the Emperor rushes toward forced achievement.
When customs decay and morals crumble,
*ren* and *yi* emerge—
grasping *ren* and *yi* to adorn one’s nature,
establishing punishments and rewards to discipline the people—
just as the bald adorn their heads or the sick seek medicine,
hoping for cure.

The *Huainanzi* says:
*"Counting grains and combing hair bring only greater trouble—
how much more so when actions are forced!"*
What difference is there
between scratching one’s back with the knee
or untangling knots with the heel?
If one understands the error of these four things,
then the hope of returning to purity may be realized.

**Annotations:**
*Hair (髱)*—hair.
*Decay (颓)*—ruin.
*Decadent (靡)*—tilted, unsteady.
*Comb (栉)*—to comb.

When the Great Dao decays,
*ren* and *yi* arise.
**Commentary:**
When purity disperses and simplicity scatters,
the Great Dao does not prevail—
thus *ren* and *yi* emerge as lesser achievements.
Deficiency breeds greed,
and artificiality sparks decay.
Yet the Sage’s concern for the age remains unchanged,
though the paths to salvation differ.

**Exegesis:**
When the Great Dao decays,
customs become vulgar and shallow,
the people compete in frivolity,
the subtle *Way* fades,
and the serene, pure transformation vanishes—
the Dao of effortless perfection is lost.
Thus it is called *decay*.

**Explanation:**
*Decay* means the Sage’s *Way* and the Emperor’s virtue are far gone.
Rulers strive for dominion, scheming and deceitful.
Time has strayed from truth,
and hearts are consumed by empty competition.
The deep, tranquil *Way* of natural ease fades daily,
while the harmonious, still transformation erodes.
When the Great Dao does not prevail,
this is called *decay*.
As the *Great Rites* says:
*"When the Great Dao is hidden, the world becomes a family."*

*Vulgar (浇)*—to moisten, like water soaking earth.
*Shallow (漓)*—water seeping into the ground.
The ancient purity was like water absorbed by the earth—
once scattered, it cannot be recovered.
Thus it is called *vulgar and shallow*.

**Exegesis:**
When the Dao decays,
there arises *ren* of universal love,
and *yi* of righteous judgment—
yet these only bind the people in artificiality.

**Explanation:**
*Ren* is the awkward posture of forced benevolence,
*yi* is the strained stance of fabricated righteousness—
both are constrained in form,
striving in appearance,
not vast and free.
The farther one strays from the Dao,
the clearer the Sage’s traces become—
*ren* and *yi* are not genuine,
ritual and music distort nature,
and only their rigid, artificial forms remain—
none reflect the true, unified sincerity.

**Exegesis:**
Thus *Zhuangzi* says:
*"The Dao is hidden in petty achievements."*
By *petty achievements*, he means *ren* and *yi*,
each claiming partial success,
yet failing to unite in the Great Way.
Thus they are called *petty achievements*.

**Explanation:**
When the Great Dao is hidden,
the highest virtue collapses.
The *ren*-ous act only for *ren*,
the *yi*-ous act only for *yi*—
they cannot merge into one harmonious transformation,
each establishing a separate name.
Compared to *virtue/power*,
they are already small.
How much smaller still compared to the Great Dao!

*"The Dao is hidden in petty achievements"*—
as in *Zhuangzi’s* ["Amalgam"] where Nan Guo Ziqi tells Zi You:
*"The Dao is hidden yet has truth and falsehood,
words are hidden yet have right and wrong.
The Dao departs yet does not vanish,
words remain yet cannot be relied upon."*
The Dao is hidden in petty achievements,
words are hidden in empty ornamentation.
This refers to the petty achievements of *ren* and *yi*,
and the empty ornamentation of false distinctions.
Those who cling to words and teachings
only deepen confusion—
thus the Sage says there are *Rujia* and *Mojia*,
each condemning what the other upholds.
In this tangled dispute,
none can reach true certainty,
and chaos arises from it.

When wisdom emerges,
great deception follows.
**Commentary:**
Those who rely on wisdom
will inevitably establish laws.
Once laws are made, deceit flourishes—
thus great deception arises.
How could counterfeiting seals and measures
be any different?

**Exegesis:**
When wisdom emerges,
later generations use intelligence to legislate,
establish codes to curb vice,
and create seals and measures to ensure trust.
Fearful of injustice, they invent standards of weight and measure.
Yet the unvirtuous steal official seals and alter weights—
thus, the very laws meant to curb deceit
only encourage greater fraud.
Hence, it is said that great deception follows.

**Explanation:**
*Wisdom*—the mind’s insight.
*Insight*—discernment and understanding.

「**Commentary:**
*Check* means to bind and restrain.
*Responsibility* means to censure.
*Seals* mean to verify trust.
*Impressions* mean stamps.

When **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** are concealed,
**ren** (benevolence) and **yi** (righteousness) are practiced.
When **ren** and **yi** flourish,
**wisdom** is employed.
Laws multiply like autumn’s thistle,
nets tighten like congealed fat,
yet people grow ever more chaotic.

When the **Dao/Way** of cunning devices—
crossbows, snares, and traps—
is excessive,
birds are disturbed in the sky.
When the **Dao/Way** of hooks, baits, and nets
is excessive,
fish are disturbed in the waters.
When the **Dao/Way** of snares, pitfalls, and nooses
is excessive,
beasts are disturbed in the marshes.

As **deception** and **craftiness** spread,
words become twisted, falsehoods hardened,
and interpretations diverge—
then the common folk are bewildered by sophistry.

Thus, when the world is in great disorder,
the fault lies in the love of **wisdom**.

**Exegesis:**
*Laws*—standards.
They are established to restrain the people.
*Codes*—eternal.
They are enacted to censure deceit.

*Seals*—engraved texts that match for verification,
like the **gold tiger-bamboo soldier** seals of trust.
*Impressions*—the **Son of Heaven** uses *zhi* (impressions),
lords use *yin* (seals).
The hierarchy of ranks ensures trust through them.

The origin of *hu* (斛):
It begins with *gui* (圭).
Sixty-four grains of millet make one *gui*,
ten *gui* make one *chao* (抄),
ten *chao* make one *cuo* (撮),
ten *cuo* make one *shao* (勺),
ten *shao* make one *he* (合),
ten *he* make one *sheng* (升),
ten *sheng* make one *dou* (斗).
Five *dou* and four *sheng* make one *hu*,
used to measure goods.

Those with **wisdom** set these seals, measures, and codes,
to limit and restrain,
to detect theft—
yet who knows they may not become the greatest thieves themselves?

**Tian Chang** of Qi falsely upheld **ren** and **yi**,
and in a single day assassinated his lord,
seizing the kingdom for twelve generations.
Qi’s seals, measures, and codes—
the **sage’s wisdom**—
were all in Tian Chang’s hands.
Thus, **wisdom** in making laws
only breeds great deception.

Later, those who stole kingdoms
often relied on the laws of the Tian lineage.

**Wang Mang** stole the throne from Han,
**Sima Xianwang** from Wei,
**Emperor Wu of Liang** from Qi,
**Emperor Wen of Sui** from Zhou.
Would it not be better to burn the seals,
break the impressions,
and let the people be simple and uncontentious?
To discard the measures,
fold the balances,
and abolish all the **sage’s laws**,
so the people might deliberate on the **Dao/Way**?

**Six Kinships** in discord,
yet there are filial and kind children.

**Six Kinships**—father, son, husband, wife, brother, sister—
are estranged, lacking order.
Yet each has their own filial and kind actions,
all due to straying from the **Dao/Way**,
hence the partial names.

**Filial**—serving one’s parents.
*The Book of Rites* (礼□祭统) says:
**Filial** is to cherish.
*The Explanation of Names* (释名) says:
**Filial** is to love.
*The Law of Posthumous Names* (谥法) says:
Perfect compliance is called **filial**.

In summary,
**filial** is the enduring **Dao/Way** of serving parents,
exhausting all care and nurturing,
delighting in their contentment,
and obeying without resistance.

*The Classic of Erya* (尔雅) says:
To serve parents well is **filial**.

**Kind**—to provide care when they leave,
and return when they come.

Those who bear the names of **filial** and **kind**
boast of their virtues,
yet they fail to see
that in the age of the **Great Dao/Way**,
the world is a single household.
The ruler above nurtures those below,
a natural order—
to treat others as oneself,
not just cherishing one’s own kin,
then all people could be **filial**.
To treat others as one’s own children,
not just raising one’s own offspring,
then all the young could be **kind**.

Where then could the names of **filial** and **kind** apply?
*The Doctrine of the Mean* (礼运篇) states:
Confucius served in Lu,
participating in the **sacrificial guests** (蜡宾),
and after the rites concluded,
he visited the **Xianwei Pavilion** (象魏之观),
where he saw the sacrificial rituals were incomplete.
Gazing upon the ancient site,
he sighed deeply.
His disciple **Zigong** (言偃) asked,
and Confucius replied:
*The Great Dao/Way* in practice,
the brilliance of the **Three Dynasties**,
I have not yet witnessed it—
yet I strive for it.

*The Great Dao/Way* in practice:
The world is held in common.
The worthy and capable are selected,
trust is honored, and harmony cultivated.
No one cherishes only their own kin,
no one raises only their own children.
The aged have a place to rest,
the able find purpose in life,
the young grow and thrive,
the widowed, orphaned, elderly, disabled, and sick all have sustenance.
Men are allotted their share,
women find their home.
Wealth is hated when cast aside,
not hoarded for oneself.
Strength is hated when unused,
not monopolized for oneself.
Thus, scheming is nonexistent,
and theft, robbery, and disorder do not arise.

Hence, outer doors are left unclosed—
this is called **Great Harmony**.

In such an age,
acts of **filial** care—
fanning pillows, warming beds,
providing for parents when they leave and return—
have no place to be applied.
All are treated as kin—
where would partial names arise?
It is merely self-aggrandizement.

When a state is in decline,
there are **loyal ministers**.
**Commentary:**
In times of peace,
when ruler and subjects are settled,
what need is there for such names?
Yet in days of chaos,
when danger is seen,
**loyal ministers** arise.

**Exegesis:**
*Loyal*—the duty of a subject,
yet why say there are **loyal ministers**?
How could there be such a distinction?
In times of decline,
when peril is evident,
they risk their lives—
thus, **loyal ministers** appear.
Yet *loyal* is the natural role of a subject—
why then does it become a special name?
」

When the sovereign fails to govern his ministers properly,
then flatterers gain favor,
plotting to mislead the ruler into folly,
and thus bring about calamity.
Yet those who see peril and risk their lives—
dying in hardship to save the state—
are hailed as **loyal ministers**.

**Exegesis:**
*Loyal* means upright and correct—this is **loyalty**.
The *Spring and Autumn Annals* says:
**"Loyalty** is the foundation of the state’s stability."
Serving the ruler as a subject,
**loyalty** must be the foundation.
If one is filial to their parents,
then they will be **loyal** to their ruler.

Flattery is **flatterer’s art** (*nìng*),
obscuring truth is **folly** (*hūn*),
and disorder between ruler and subjects is **chaos** (*luàn*).
When **flatterers** stand beside the throne,
the ruler’s discernment is clouded,
unable to banish flatterers and promote the virtuous,
thus plunging himself into **folly and chaos**.

Once **chaos** takes root,
strife erupts.
Externally, there are invading foes,
internally, there are palace rebellions.
Thus, worthy ministers risk their lives,
resolving crises and aiding peril—
some gain fame and renown,
others die in service to the state.
It is through such deeds that the title of **loyal minister** is established.

Had **Emperor Tang** ruled as sovereign,
and **Yu Shun** served as minister,
with the ruler governing properly above,
and ministers aiding harmoniously below,
then the distinction of **loyal ministers** would have no place to shine.

**Exegesis:**
When the **Dao**’s transformation is widespread,
and **non-action** reigns in purity,
the multitude of virtuous scholars arise—
all are **Qí-Lóng** worthies.
The natural order is preserved,
and all things are rightly governed.

**Exegesis:**
The **Dao**’s transformation spreads like a boundless wind,
the ruler does nothing, yet all beneath are serene.
As the *Odes* say:
*"Jì-jì, many worthies—
King Wen thereby found peace."*
**Many worthies** are the multitude of ministers.
**Qí-Lóng** were Shun’s ministers.
The *Book of Documents* says:
*"Qí composed the music of rites,
the eight tones harmonized.
Striking stone with stone,
all beasts danced in rhythm.
The *Xiao* and *Shao* reached perfection,
and the phoenix came in procession.
The dragon served as speech-bearer,
transmitting the sovereign’s commands."*
**Sim**—law,
**Lún**—equality,
**Yóu**—where,
**Shù**—order,
**Yì**—harmony.
The *Book* says: *"Sim Lún Yóu Shù,"*
meaning Shun obtained worthy ministers
and the laws remained unerring.

**Exegesis:**
Then the names of **loyalty** and **filial piety** fade,
while the **Dao** of sincerity and simplicity flourishes—
what need then for **loyal ministers**?
These four are the extremes of decay—
how could they not return to sincerity?

**Exegesis:**
*Decay*—to fall,
*Privation*—to decline.
The four refer to:
**benevolence**, **righteousness**, **filial piety**, and **loyal ministers**.
When the **Dao** is abandoned, cleverness arises;
families contend, states fall—
and these four become prominent.
Because they emerge from the extremes of decay,
their names are established.
As **Great Simplicity** crumbles,
pure winds distort,
**virtue** wanes, the **Dao** is lost—
what more can be said?
Thus, when the **Dao** is hidden,
**lower virtue** takes action,
**benevolence** and **righteousness** are employed,
and clever stratagems flourish.
**Loyal ministers** gain renown in **chaos**,
**filial piety** shines in discord—
when decay reaches its peak,
the wind returns to simplicity.
The return to simplicity is fully elaborated in the next chapter:
*"Abandon the Sage, Discard Wisdom"* (Chapter Nineteen).

**Exegesis:**
The previous chapter revealed how customs decay
when the **Dao** is lost and **benevolence** and **righteousness** prevail.
This chapter explains how abandoning these paths
restores simplicity and eliminates thieves and bandits.
The first six sentences address abandoning **self-aggrandizement**,
the next three outline establishing proper teachings,
and the last four demonstrate the path’s progression.

**Exegesis:**
When the **Dao** is abandoned and customs distort,
partial names arise.
To restore simplicity,
one must abandon these partial names.
Since the four virtues of the previous chapter are ineffective,
this chapter advocates abandoning three:
**filial piety** and **compassion** return naturally,
thieves and bandits cease,
thus reviving the **Dao** of simplicity
and eliminating private desires—
what greater benefit to the world could there be?

**Abandon the Sage, Discard Wisdom—**
the people gain a hundredfold benefit.

**Commentary:**
Abandon the traces of the **Sage**’s teachings,
then transformation follows **non-action**.
Discard the cunning of ordinary wisdom,
then people return to sincerity.
Sincerity eliminates deceit,
**non-action** eradicates **self-aggrandizement**.
Humans align with **Heaven’s harmony**,
and all things flourish without harm.
Thus, the people gain a hundredfold benefit.

**Exegesis:**
The **Sage** is one who acts and creates.
The **wise** are those who rely on cunning stratagems.
The **Sage**’s actions leave traces,
the **wise**’s cunning is not genuine.
Losing genuineness breeds deceit,
following traces leads to losing the root—
both must be abandoned to preserve sincerity.
When **Heaven’s harmony** flows freely,
**self-aggrandizement** ceases,
and the people gain a hundredfold benefit.

**Exegesis:**
The **Sage** of **non-action** possesses inner clarity,
their wisdom responds to all things,
adapting effortlessly to each moment.
Compared to the **Sage** and the **wise**,
their ways are profound and trace-less.
The **Sage** who acts and the **wise** who scheme
leave behind their traces—
people cling to these traces,
yet what they cling to is not the means of adaptation.
If they rigidly apply these traces,
they drift further from the **Dao**.
Why?
Because the **Sage** and the **wise** establish laws
to defend the state.
When great thieves arrive,
they steal the **Sage**’s laws to seize the state.
How so?
If they do not steal the **Sage**’s laws,
they have no way to take the state.
Thus, the **Sage**’s laws,
originally meant to guard the state,
become, in their extreme cleverness,
the very tools by which the state is stolen.
**Laozi** warns:
*"Forgotten, the **Sage** becomes principle;
pursued, the **Sage** becomes chaos."*
If one forgets the traces of the **Sage**,
discards the artifice of wisdom,
then sincerity returns and deceit ceases.
People return to joy and harmony,
unharmed and unspoiled,
customs revert to simplicity,
with no grievances or strife—
each preserves their life,
and the people gain a hundredfold benefit.

**Abandon Benevolence, Discard Righteousness—**
the people return to **filial piety** and **compassion**.

**Commentary:**
Abandon the **benevolence** of universal love,
discard the **righteousness** of judging others,
then people return to **great filial piety** and **compassion**.

**Exegesis:**
The previous chapter stated:
*"When the **Dao** is abandoned, **benevolence** and **righteousness** arise."*
This chapter says:
*"Abandon **benevolence**, discard **righteousness**,
and the people return to **filial piety** and **compassion**."*
It clarifies that in the age of the **Dao**’s return—
what is called **primordial unity**—
the people have no private kin,
yet all are filled with **compassion** and **filial piety**.

Thus, when **principles** reach their fullness, all **artifice** vanishes,
and when **affairs** are rightly ordered, their **names** are cast aside.

**Explanation:**
The six bonds of kinship are discordant,
then the **names** of **filial piety** and **compassion** stand alone.
When the **Dao** prevails in the world,
the **virtue** of **primordial simplicity** is restored.
Once **simplicity** and **purity** are restored,
all are **filial** and **compassionate**—
this is called having no private kin.

So, it is the **renunciation** of **artificial** **benevolence** and **righteousness**
that restores the **primordial unity** of **filial piety** and **compassion**.
The absence of private kin
is not the same as favoring one’s own kin.

**Exegesis:**
Now, when the six bonds of kinship are abandoned,
the **names** of **filial piety** and **compassion** become prominent.
If one abandons the **universal benevolence** of **Dao**,
discards the **judicial righteousness** of **Dao**,
then there is no **artificial** advancement of **virtue** in the **six bonds**,
and **filial piety** and **compassion** arise naturally.
Hence, the people return to **great filial piety** and **compassion**.

**Explanation:**
The six bonds of kinship—
also called the six relations—
are those of **sovereign-subject**, **father-son**, **husband-wife**.
When these six relations are harmonious,
all are **filial** and all are **compassionate**.
When they are discordant,
there are some who are **filial** and some who are not,
some who are **compassionate** and some who are not.
The unfilial are many,
so the **filial** stand out in their **virtue**.
The uncompassionate are many,
so the **compassionate** shine in their **beauty**.
This is why:
**Benevolence** and **righteousness** are imposed between them,
and their **names** are thus exalted and advanced.

If one governs with the **Dao**,
stirs the people with **primordial simplicity**,
and discards **artificial** **benevolence** and **righteousness**,
then the people return to being all **filial** and all **compassionate**.

Fish on land,
moisten each other with saliva,
nourish each other with dew—
yet this is not as good as
forgetting each other in the rivers and lakes.

Why?
Moistening with saliva and nourishing with dew
are but ways of expressing mutual love.
To forget each other in the rivers and lakes
is to each find their own ease—
why wait for the small love of moistening and nourishing?

**Partial filial piety** and **partial compassion**
are but the love of moistening and nourishing.

In the *Zhuangzi* ["Heavenly Culture" chapter],
**Laozi** told **Confucius**:
*"If you apply the **Dao** of **benevolence** and **righteousness** to the world,
no greater chaos will arise."*

Indeed, **benevolence** and **righteousness**,
when practiced in this way,
only provoke resentment in my heart—
why not instead
let the people of the world retain their **primordial simplicity**,
move with **spontaneity**,
and uphold **virtue** as a whole,
rather than
be like one who beats a drum to search for a lost son?

The **primordial simplicity** of black and white
is insufficient for **discrimination**,
the **appearance** of fame and reputation
is insufficient for **expansion**,
fish moistening and nourishing each other
is not as good as forgetting each other in the rivers and lakes,
and people practicing **mutual benevolence**
is not as good as forgetting each other in **Dao/Way** and **art**.

**Renounce artifice, discard profit**—
then thieves and robbers will have none.

**Commentary:**
When men value **partial virtue** and **artificial skill**,
and harbor **desires for gain**,
then thieves and robbers arise.
Hence, to **renounce artifice** means people no longer compete,
and to **discard profit** means people find self-sufficiency—
so thieves and robbers will have none.

**Exegesis:**
To **renounce artifice** means to abandon **excessive craftsmanship**,
**illegal adornments**, and **debaucherous excesses**.
To **discard profit** means to abandon **pursuit of wealth**,
**exploitation through monopolies**,
and **fraudulent transactions**.
Thieves and robbers arise from **envy** and **insatiable desire**.
Now, if one **renounces artifice**, people no longer compete,
and if one **discards profit**, people find self-sufficiency—
when each is self-sufficient,
who would still be a thief or robber?
Thus, it is said that there will be none.

**Explanation:**
**Excessive craftsmanship** and **debaucherous excesses**,
though **artful**, serve no true purpose—
why indulge in them?
Even the **carving of monkeys** on wood by the **Wei** people,
or the **engraving of mulberry leaves** by the **Song** people,
though pleasing to the eye,
ultimately disturb the heart—
these are the sorts of things that should be abandoned.

**Pursuit of wealth** obstructs **conduct**,
**exploitation through monopolies** deprives others,
and **fraudulent transactions** involve deceit.
If any of these exist,
what is not theft?
To reject and discard them,
and to follow one’s proper share,
is to have enough—
why would there still be thieves and robbers?

Moreover, those who cultivate the **Dao**,
should **renounce artifice**—
the **artifice** of **internal desires** and **external luxuries**,
the **artifice** of **sharp emotions** and **sensory attachments**—
then the **three poisons** are purified,
and the **six thieves** will have none.

**Commentary:**
These three **renunciations**—
though they are stated,
do not yet show how to **cultivate**—
thus, they are insufficient for **instruction** in the text.
Therefore, further **cultivation** is prescribed,
as seen in the following passage.

**Exegesis:**
The three **renunciations** are:
**1.** Renounce the **Sage** and discard **wisdom**,
**2.** Renounce **benevolence** and discard **righteousness**,
**3.** Renounce **artifice** and discard **profit**.
Though these three are to be abandoned,
they do not yet prescribe **cultivation**—
thus, they are insufficient for **instruction** in the text,
and further **cultivation** is prescribed,
as in the passage on **"seeing simplicity"** and the rest.

**Explanation:**
The **Sage** and **wisdom** abandoned,
the people enjoy their **benefits**.
**Benevolence** and **righteousness** abandoned,
all return to **filial piety** and **compassion**.
**Artifice** and **profit** abandoned,
the people have no thieves or robbers.
Once these three are abandoned,
the **Dao** will show how to **cultivate** and restore antiquity.
Thus, it is said that this is insufficient,
and the following passage is prescribed.

**Prescribed Cultivation:**
*"See simplicity, embrace purity,
reduce selfishness, diminish desire."*

**Commentary:**
See **true simplicity**,
embrace **primordial purity**,
reduce **private evil**,
diminish **greedy desire**.

**Exegesis:**
To seek to **renounce the Sage** and **discard wisdom**,
one must always **see true simplicity**.
**Explanation:**
To be in accord with **non-desire** is to be **simple and pure**,
and **simple and pure** is to restore the **nature of the people**.
The absence of **knowledge** and **desire** is to merge with **true simplicity**,
and when **true simplicity** is merged,
the **traces of the Sage** and **wisdom** are abandoned.

**Exegesis:**
To seek to **renounce benevolence** and **discard righteousness**,
one must **embrace primordial simplicity**.
**Explanation:**
To guard one’s heart with **sincere simplicity** and **unadorned purity**,
then the **benevolence of universal love** and the **righteousness of judging others** are abandoned.

**Exegesis:**
To seek to **renounce artifice** and **discard profit**,
one must **reduce selfishness** and **diminish desire**.
**Explanation:**
When **private evil** does not spread in **nature**,
and **greedy desire** does not arise in the heart,
then **debaucherous artifice** and **exploitative profit** are abandoned.

**Exegesis:**
Though the three **renunciations** are insufficient in the text,
the four **practices** provide ample **cultivation** for the body.
To prevent **evil** from arising in the heart,
one must rely on **internal cultivation**.
**Explanation:**
The **Sage**, **wisdom**, **benevolence**, **righteousness**, **artifice**, and **profit**—
these six things,
when first practiced, serve to **save the people**,
but when clung to, they **obstruct the Dao**.
Thus, **deceitful schemes** and **theft** arise from them.
To **renounce** and **discard** them,
one may restore **true simplicity**.
Once **true simplicity** is restored,
then **internal cultivation** is applied.

To reveal the four **practices** at their conclusion,
is the **essential subtlety** of the **true Dao**.

**Explanation:**
When **artificial traces** of the **Sage** appear,
then **deceitful schemes** and **cunning intelligence** arise.
**Benevolence** arises from **non-benevolence**,
**righteousness** comes from **non-righteousness**,
**filial piety** is prominent when **unfilial** actions exist,
and **compassion** shines when **non-compassion** is present.

---

**能绝有迹有为，自复至慈至孝。**
When one severs all traces and artificial actions,
one restores **true simplicity**—
**ultimate compassion** and **filial piety** emerge naturally.

**斥淫巧则私利息，私利既息，盗贼不生，然后凝旒於朴素之乡，杜念於私欲之境，人登富寿，国致遐长。**
To reject **deceitful schemes** and **artifice** is to still **private gain**;
when **private gain** subsides, **theft and banditry** cease.
Then, **refined simplicity** takes root in the land,
and **selfish cravings** are extinguished in the heart.
Thus, the people attain **wealth and longevity**,
and the realm achieves **enduring prosperity**.

This is the **effect** of the **ruler’s practice of the Dao**.

**若夫心除嗜欲，身荡浮华，翦锐进之情，锄耽着之本，六贼不作，三元坦夷，四行克修，久视何远。**
As for those who **purge desire from the heart**,
**cast off superficiality from the body**,
**sever ambitious strivings**,
and **uproot the roots of attachment**—
the **six malevolent influences** vanish,
the **Three August Ones** [1] dwell in tranquility,
and the **Four Virtues** are fully cultivated.
How distant can **longevity** be?

This is the **effect** of the **practitioner’s cultivation**.

*Moral Canon of the True Dao: Broad Explication of the Sacred Meaning*
*Volume Seventeen Complete*
*Volume Eighteen*
*Attributed to Master Guangcheng of Tang by Du Guangting*
*Chapter Twenty: "The Chapter on Severing Learning to Know No Worry"*

**疏：**
The previous chapter clarified **severing and abandoning** the myriad paths,
restoring **primordial simplicity**—
thus, **theft and banditry** vanish.
This chapter elucidates **fearing and eliminating** worldly learning,
for the **enlightened** alone differ from the **common**.

The first sentence **marks the path** to demonstrate **severance**,
the next seven **offer analogies** to clarify principle,
another seventeen **contrast the common and the sage**,
and the final two **conclude with the solitary practitioner**.

**○义曰：**
**Sever** the learning of **artificial gain**,
to cultivate **serenity and harmony**.
Eliminate **superficial pursuits**,
and **worry and calamity** will not arise.

Using the analogy of **"Yes" and "Ah"** [2] to illustrate,
it serves to distinguish **severance** from **not severing**.

**Severance** and **not severing** both originate in the heart;
**"Yes"** and **"Ah"** both emerge from the mouth.
**Severance** aligns with **emptiness and stillness**, returning to the Dao,
while **not severing** leads to **drowning**—
**intellect** obscures **truth**,
**"Yes"** brings **reverence and caution** without blame,
**"Ah"** breeds **arrogance and defiance**, inviting punishment.
Though both arise from **heart and speech**, their outcomes differ—**auspicious or inauspicious**.

What people fear is **inviting punishment** and **losing truth**,
yet they cannot **sever knowledge and perception** to remain reverent.
Once they **know this**, they **must** fear it.
This is an **exhortation to sever learning**.

The common follow **contrary to the Dao**,
while the **sage** stands **uniquely apart**.
They **abandon** the **rich feasts of the Tailao** [3],
**withdraw** from the **spring pavilion’s distractions**,
**remove** the **harm of keen discernment**,
and **reject** **artificial contrivance**.

**Bound and stifled**, they **embrace the Mother of Qi** [4] like an infant’s movement,
thus **containing the Ultimate Truth**.

**Severing Learning Knows No Worry.**

**注：**
Severing **artificial worldly learning** preserves **primordial simplicity**;
with **few desires and little private gain**, there is **no worry**.

**疏：**
**Severing learning** means **severing artificial worldly learning**.
All people are born with **true simplicity and purity**,
but **exceeding their natural measure** in learning **harms their nature**.
If one **completely severs all action**, one **lacks cultivation**.
Now, we **sever only the excessive artificial learning**.

**义曰：**
**Sever**—this means **removal and cessation**.
The **Venerable Laozi** wished later generations to **gradually emulate simplicity and harmony**,
to **sever false habits**,
hence the text on **severing learning**.

**Artificial worldly learning** refers to the **worldly, contrived studies** of the age.
From the **Three Dynasties onward**, people were **frantic**,
ultimately relying on **rewards and punishments**—
how could they have **leisure to nurture their true nature and life**?

Those who delight in **clarity** indulge in **lust for color**;
those who delight in **acuity** indulge in **lust for sound**.
Delighting in **benevolence** confuses **virtue**,
delighting in **righteousness** defies **principle**,
delighting in **rites** aids **deceit**,
delighting in **music** aids **lust**,
delighting in **sageliness** aids **artifice**,
delighting in **knowledge** aids **flaws**.

These eight are the **greatest of studies**.
If one **rests content** in their **natural endowment**,
they **avoid excessive cravings**.

If they **exceed their measure**, **pursue beyond their nature**, and **indulge** in these,
they **invite excess and perversity**,
**injuring their innate harmony**,
**disrupting their natural disposition**.

If one **completely severs** all,
they **lose what should be cultivated**.
But if one **only severs the excessive artificial learning**,
**trusting in the true and constant**,
this aligns with **principle**.

**疏：**
This is what **Zhuangzi** called **"worldly learning seeking to restore its origin."**
If one’s learning is **within their natural measure**,
and they **follow their nature**—
even the **superior sage** exerts effort without **transgressing severance**,
hence **"Severing Learning Knows No Worry."**

**义曰：**
*Zhuangzi’s* **"Chapter on Nurturing Life"** states:
*"Worldly learning seeking to restore its origin"*—
those in the world have already **cultivated their nature and life** in **worldly ways**,
yet they wish to **use worldly learning to restore their original nature and life**—
this is **even more contrary to the Dao**.
Such are the **deluded masses**, far from the **Way**.

Why not **abandon contrived knowledge** and **trust spontaneous awareness**?
Even if one’s **intellect encompasses all things**,
they remain **serene and self-sufficient**.

**Within one’s measure** means **following one’s nature** and **trusting in true simplicity**.
To **trust in truth**—
**wisdom** is **wisdom**, but **forcing beyond one’s measure** becomes **deceit**.
To **trust in truth**—
**rites** are **rites**, but **forcing beyond one’s measure** becomes **chaos**.
To **trust in truth**—
**loyalty** is **loyalty**, but **forcing beyond one’s measure** becomes **flattery**.
To **trust in truth**—
**benevolence** is **benevolence**, but **forcing beyond one’s measure** becomes **ingratiation**.
To **trust in truth**—
**righteousness** is **righteousness**, but **forcing beyond one’s measure** becomes **theft**.
To **trust in truth**—
**sincerity** is **sincerity**, but **forcing beyond one’s measure** becomes **deception**.

**Forcing beyond one’s measure** leads to **loss and worry**,
while **resting in one’s measure** brings **truth and no fear**—
hence, **"Severing Learning Knows No Worry."**

The **superior sage’s diligent practice** is to **guard true simplicity** and **avoid artificiality**.

**"Yes" and "Ah"**—how distant are they?
**Good and evil**—how far apart are they?

**注：**
**"Yes"** is **reverent response**,
**"Ah"** is **arrogant response**.
Both emerge from the mouth—
hence, **"how distant are they?"**
**Reverence** brings **good fortune**,
**arrogance** brings **calamity**—
this illustrates that **severing worldly learning** brings **no worry**,
while **not severing** invites **suffering**—
the difference lies only in **the mind’s reflection**, not in **physical distance**.

**疏：**
**"Yes"**—this is **reverent response**.
*The Book of Rites* says: *"When the elder summons, do not answer ‘Yes’; respond with ‘Yes’ and rise."*

**义曰：**
**"Yes"**—**voice is solemn**, **demeanor is respectful**.
**Response**—this means **answering appropriately**.

---

**The Master** refers to one’s father, elder brothers, teachers, and elders.
**Challenging** means summoning.
When a father or elder brother summons, if one answers with *"No"* (諾), there is still fear of delay—
upon hearing the call, one should immediately rise, hence the *"Yes"* (唯) and rising.

*The Analects* states:
*"When there is wine and food, the master is served first."*
**Note:** *"Master"* here refers to father and elder brothers.
One must not overstep the Dao when following the master,
and when speaking with others, one must be respectful and deferential.
All these illustrate the same principle of **reverence and propriety**.

**Commentary:**
*"Ah"* (阿) is an **arrogant response**.
*The Book of Han* says: *"Who dares question me?"* (不誰何) —
*"Who"* (誰) here means *"dare to question."*

This is an illustrative analogy.
*"Yes"* and *"Ah"* both emerge from the mouth—
*"Yes"* with reverence brings **good fortune**,
*"Ah"* with arrogance brings **evil**.
Whether one **severes worldly learning** or not lies only in the mind—
if severed, there is **no worry**;
if not severed, **suffering arises**.

Both *"Yes"* and *"Ah"* originate from the mouth,
yet their **distance** lies in the heart—
thus, *"how distant are they?"*
Their **difference** lies in the mind—
thus, *"how far apart are they?"*

If one truly understands **learning without learning**,
where all attachments to learning are emptied,
and in **knowing, forgets knowing**—
no distinctions arise—
then *"Yes"* and *"Ah"* become unified,
and **good and evil are both forgotten**.

**Meaning:**
This clarifies that **reverent response** and **arrogant response**,
though both emerging from the mouth,
differ in **virtue and vice**—
while **severing worldly learning** or not
depends on the mind,
yet severing brings **serenity**,
while not severing brings **toil**.

Not severing invites **anxious thoughts and labored contemplation**,
while severing brings **tranquil spirit and harmonious virtue**.

**Learning without learning** means **daily diminishing** it.
*The Scripture of Transforming the Barbarians* says:
*"The origin of learning is non-learning;
it can subdue the fierce and the proud."*
This means that through the **Dao of non-action**,
one can subdue the **coarse and unruly** of the world.

*The Scripture of Western Ascension* states:
*"I learn without learning,
and thus can clarify the natural."*
*The Dao De Jing* says:
*"Learning without learning,
one avoids the errors of the multitude."*
All these convey the essence of **severance**.

If one comprehends this meaning,
then all attachments to learning will be emptied.

All worldly phenomena are **artificial**—
artificial things must decay and perish,
hence, they are **empty**.
Only **non-action and non-doing** bring
**clarity, stillness, and ease**—
internally aligning with the **True Constant**,
externally free from distinctions—
thus, *"Yes"* and *"Ah"* become unified,
and **good and evil are both forgotten**.

What people fear,
one must indeed fear.
**Note:**
What people generally fear are **arrogance and evil**.
The virtuous fear **worldly learning and artificiality**.
All must be severed—
thus, one must indeed fear them.

**Commentary:**
What people fear are **arrogance and evil**.
Arrogance leads to **transgression**,
while evil invites **disdain**.
To incur disdain is to be **abandoned by others**,
while transgression invites **blame and resentment**.
By analogy, **worldly learning and artificiality** breed **discord and conflict**—
if one does not fear and sever them,
they will **violate propriety and harm nature**,
thus, one must indeed fear and sever them.

**Meaning:**
People fear **arrogance and evil**,
yet they do not fear how **worldly learning** fuels **discord**,
generates **regret and blame**,
and exhausts the mind and spirit—
thus, they fail to sever it.

Therefore, those who follow the **Dao** fear
how **worldly learning** oversteps bounds and harms nature,
and they abandon and sever it—
this surpasses the common fear of **arrogance and evil**.

**How vast and endless it is!**
**Note:**
If one does not fear and sever worldly learning,
then the **true nature of all beings** will be **ruined**,
and there will be **no end to it**.

**Commentary:**
*"Ruined"* means **decayed**.
Arrogance and evil lead to **transgression**,
while worldly learning **loses its true essence**—
all are worthy of fear,
thus, they must be abandoned and severed.
If not severed and abandoned,
then the **true nature will be ruined**,
and there will be **no end to it**.

**Meaning:**
*"End"* (央) means **center**, **dawn**, or **halt**.
Worldly learning, when **clear**, breeds **pedantry**;
when **wise**, breeds **discord**;
when **perverse**, breeds **licentiousness**;
when **deceitful**, breeds **boastfulness**;
when **scanty**, breeds **ambition**;
when **excessive**, breeds **exhaustion**;
when **bold**, breeds **contention**;
when **skilled**, breeds **superiority and inferiority**.
The evil overcome others while seeking victory,
the ambitious seek vast knowledge while seeking more,
and they **toil endlessly**, exhausting the mind and harming nature—
this **deviates from the true and pure**,
hence, it is said to **lose its true essence**.

Once deviating from the true and pure,
the **natural virtue is ruined**—
just as fertile soil, originally free of filth,
becomes overgrown with weeds and thorns,
ruining its purity and harming its true nature.
Worldly learning **ruins human nature**,
just as weeds **spread unchecked**—
thus, it is called **ruined**.

*The Spring and Autumn Annals* says:
*"Do not allow it to spread unchecked—
it will be difficult to uproot."*
Weeds, once spread, cannot be easily removed—
this is its meaning.

**Commentary:**
*The Odes* says: *"The night is not yet over"*—
meaning the **clocks still chime**.
Here, *"not yet over"* means that **worldly learning harms nature**,
with **no end in sight**—
the path ahead remains long,
hence, *"not yet over."*

**Meaning:**
Worldly learning, once encountered, **proliferates**—
if not severed, it will **grow daily**,
spreading chaos endlessly,
with **no halt in sight**.

*The Zhou Poetry [□Small Odes□Ting Liao]* says:
*"The night is not yet over"*—
*"Over"* (央) means **dawn**.
*"Not yet over"* means the night has not yet reached dawn.
Worldly learning, if not severed,
cannot be exhausted.

The multitude **rejoices and thrives**,
like feasting on **oxen and sheep**,
or ascending to the **Spring Terrace**.
**Note:**
The multitude, engaged in **worldly learning and artificiality**,
**pursues sensory gratification**,
like one about to feast on **oxen and sheep**,
or ascending the **Spring Terrace** to gaze—
every movement stirs **greed and attachment**.

**Commentary:**
*"Rejoicing and thriving"* describes the **unrestrained movement of desires**.
This illustrates those who **do not fear severing learning**.

Worldly learning and artificiality
stir **desires and emotions**,
and they **pursue sensory objects**,
toiling endlessly in life.
Like a **hungry man feasting on oxen and sheep**,
indulging in flavors,
or a **beautiful woman ascending the Spring Terrace**,
gazing and stirring **lust and attachment**.

**Meaning:**
*"Beautiful woman"*—
*The Book of Changes [□Commentary]* says:
*"Suave appearance leads to licentiousness"*—
meaning a woman’s **alluring beauty**,
though elegant, lacks **moral restraint**,
and stirs **lustful desires**.
How much more so when ascending the Spring Terrace to gaze!

*"Rejoicing and thriving"* describes **harmony and delight**.
Those immersed in worldly learning
**drown in their nature**,
rejoicing in themselves without awareness,
yet **toiling endlessly**—
their **desires drag them**, **discord plagues them**,
and **fortune and misfortune arise from this**.

Then there are those with **six seals hanging at their waist**,
five palaces interlinked—
one outburst makes the feudal lords tremble,
one settled abode brings the world to rest.

They revel in fleeting splendor, sated by their ambitions,
find joy in transient wealth and noble rank.
Five cauldrons arrayed for feasting,
sated by the excess of **ox, sheep, and swine**;
a profusion of fragrant flowers delighting the senses,
taking pleasure in the unrestrained gaze from the **Spring Terrace**.

Some indulge in **Yan’s sisters and Luo’s beauties**,
dance to Chu’s rhythms and Wu’s songs—
the **Eight Tones** dull their hearing,
the **Five Colors** dazzle their vision.
Though they revel, what end awaits them?
Perhaps **prosperity fades into adversity**,
fortune turns to misfortune,
shifting **harmony’s joy into trembling dread**.

**Confucius said to Yan Hui:**
*"Once, I thought embracing Heaven’s will and knowing fate brought no sorrow—
now I see that embracing Heaven’s will and knowing fate bring **great sorrow** indeed."*
Even the Sage struggles thus—
how much more so the ordinary?

**Better to let the spirit roam in self-realization’s field,**
the nature find ease in the realm of forgotten knowing.

The mind longs to wed with the noble prince, hence the phrase *"return together."* According to ritual, the second month is the month for pairing—when the maiden’s heart is wounded by spring, yearning for a match. These are the words of the *Yán Shī* [邠诗]—*Odes of the Guó* [国风]—in the *"Seventh Month"* [七月篇].

The *Comangora* [倉庚]—the *Pénjiàn* [笺] says it is the *Pénghuáng* [鹏黄, oriole].

*"I alone am tranquil, yet no signs have yet emerged,
Like an infant before it can laugh."*

**Commentary:** *"I alone am tranquil and still—when it comes to greed and desire, there is not even the faintest trace. Like that infant brother who cannot yet smile."*

**Scholion:** *"I"* refers to the Old Master [老君] speaking of himself. *"I fear to sever from worldly learning, embracing the Dao and containing harmony, alone able to remain tranquil and still. Toward the affairs of the age—all deeds of ambition and desire—there is not even the faintest trace, like that infant brother who cannot yet distinguish or smile, without differentiation."*

*"Kids"* [孩] means to distinguish others. *Zhuāngzi* says: *"Not until one reaches the stage of differentiation does one begin to know."*

**Meaning:** *"Tranquil"* [怕兮] is the appearance of stillness and non-action. *"Signs"* [兆] are the initial forms of things.

The Old Master, observing the transformations of the age’s people—how they gallop after fame and profit, indulge in worldly learning, cling to desires, and waste the harmony of Heaven—all return to emptiness, not for the sake of enlightenment, but to teach them to quiet their senses, sever the roots of thought, and make them like that infant brother, undifferentiated, unaware, deeply containing the mysterious void.

An infant is one who does not yet distinguish others. *"Kids"* [孩] means to distinguish. All things without form or trace are utterly forgotten.

In the *"Heaven’s Course"* [天运篇] of *Zhuāngzi*, the Old Master told Zǐgōng: *"The governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors differed. When Shùn ruled the world, he made men’s hearts competitive."* Thus, a pregnant woman bears a child in ten months, and the child speaks at five months—not until it can distinguish does it begin to know. This speaks of *"competitive hearts"*—differentiation. Once differentiation arises, the harmonious *qi* begins to disperse. Speaking at five months is when urgency grows. From then on, things grow greatly disordered.

The *"Family Sayings"* [家语] in the *"Original Command"* [本命篇] says: *"A person at three months begins to blink, then the eyes can see. At eight months, teeth grow, then they can eat. At ten months, the knees firm, then they can walk. By three years, speech coalesces. Now, speaking at five months—harmony scatters and urgency intensifies."*

*"Buoyant, buoyant, as if having nowhere to return."*

**Commentary:** *"The Perfect Man has no heart; his movements follow things without taking or giving, like a traveler with nowhere to go."* *"Buoyant, buoyant"* is the appearance of motion.

**Scholion:** *"Buoyant, buoyant"* is the appearance of motion. Common people, when they act, become attached and always seek something, so it seems as if they have a destination. I, with no heart, tranquil and still, drift with the flow and halt at obstacles—like a traveler on the Dao, with no fixed aim, no haste.

**Meaning:** Common people, attached to their pursuits, always have desires—whether for worldly learning, the will to excel, indulgence in worldly desires, or schemes of action. Their movements of heart and thought chase after what they seek, so it seems as if they have a destination. But if the heart is without attachment to appearances, drifting freely and content, where would it linger? It is like water—unblocked, it flows; obstructed, it stops. It does not contend with things nor seek anything, so it seems to have nowhere to return.

*"All others have excess,
Yet I alone seem abandoned."*

**Commentary:** *"Excess"*—clinging to dusty affairs, boasting of cleverness and wisdom, claiming to have abundance to display their brilliance. *"Abandoned"*—constantly as if lacking, as if forgotten.

**Scholion:** Common people, clinging to worldly learning, boast of cleverness and wisdom, all grasping at methods, claiming to have excess. I alone diminish them, never lingering, the heart untouched by love or defilement, so it seems forgotten.

**Meaning:** Common people boast of worldly learning to establish fame, vie in cleverness, compete in wealth and profit—each claims excess in worldly affairs. The Old Master, forgetting the heart and stilling wisdom, without attachment or boasting, vague and yielding, seems abandoned.

*"I, a fool’s heart, am pure and simple."*

**Commentary:** *"Am I truly a fool’s heart, forgotten to this degree? But my heart is pure and simple, so it seems abandoned."*

**Scholion:** Speaking of my non-attachment to all things, thus seeming forgotten. Would that I were truly a fool’s heart? But my heart is pure and simple, unadorned by love or desire, so it seems abandoned.

**Meaning:** The Old Master is the origin of transformation, the sovereign of Heaven and Earth, possessing all wisdom, with virtue and mystery unfathomable. Yet he feigns a heartless state, merging with the Dao, teaching the people to simplify their wills, return to their natural purity, quiet their senses, and restore themselves to virtue and the Way. It is not that he was originally dull and forgotten.

*"The vulgar are bright and clear,
Yet I alone seem dim."*

**Commentary:** *"Bright and clear"*—boasting of cleverness and wisdom. *"Dim"*—self-effacing.

*"The vulgar are sharp and discerning,
Yet I alone am muddled."*

**Commentary:** *"Sharp and discerning"*—establishing laws to govern others. *"Muddled"*—only broad and magnanimous.

**Scholion:** *"Bright and clear"* is boasting of cleverness and wisdom. *"Dim"* is like being in darkness, undifferentiated. *"Sharp and discerning"* is in teaching laws to measure others. *"Muddled"* is the intent of a heartless, magnanimous mind. The reason they are bright and sharp, teaching and governing—all stem from not severing worldly learning and action. Thus, the Sage fears to be dim and silent.

**Meaning:** From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, they follow the hearts of worldly learning, forgetting the original simplicity. Governing the state, they boast of their sage wisdom, sharpen their laws and ordinances—yet the sharper the wisdom, the more troubled the governance; the clearer the laws, the more exhausted the people. The Old Master is dim and silent, transforming without action.

Zhuangzi said: At the utmost extreme of the Dao, it is dim and silent.

*"Dim"* is concealing one’s brilliance;
*"Silent"* is not speaking.

Sudden as if obscured, tranquil as if without attachment.

**Commentary:** The appearance suddenly becomes obscured, while the heart is tranquil, severed from worldly learning, as if without any fixation.

**Exegesis:** One who abandons learning and action is carefree and without concern, ever dim and tranquil, the heart utterly still, never entangled—unattached to any law, thus appearing without fixation.

**Meaning:** *"Obscured"* is dim and dark. *"Tranquil"* is empty and still. Having abandoned worldly learning, one does not boast of wisdom, does not cling to action, does not dwell in any law, does not fixate on being or non-being—both emptiness and substance forgotten, penetrating the profound essence.

The multitude all have their ways,
**Commentary:** The common folk in every age have their reasons, following the inclinations of worldly learning.

I alone am stubborn and crude.
**Commentary:** *"Stubborn"* means without distinction. *"Crude"* means lacking sufficiency. Yet my heart is truly enlightened, outwardly appearing insufficient, hence the saying.

**Exegesis:** Ordinary people do not fear worldly learning; they always have their reasons, indulging in the pursuit of external phenomena, never resting. I alone, in this age, am without distinction, having what is crude and lacking. *"Stubborn"* means without distinction. *"Crude"* means lacking sufficiency. Yet my heart is truly enlightened, hence the saying.

The multitude bustle below, all seeking clarity.

**Meaning:** The common folk in the world move according to customary laws, all clinging to action, hence they have their ways. *"Ways"* means *"doing."* The Old Master inwardly comprehends all laws, deeply penetrating the source of the Dao, outwardly appearing dim and foolish, as if crude and vulgar.

The *Classic* below states: *"All under heaven say my Dao is great, yet I seem unworthy."* If I were worthy, it would have long been refined.

This is the same meaning.

From *"The multitude bustle below,"* the sixfold Sagely conducts contrast with worldly learning as worldly, clearly showing that one must abandon it and return to the Great Dao.

I alone differ from others,
**Commentary:** Others have desires; I have no attachments. Others oppose the Dao; I align with it.

And yet I value seeking nourishment from the Mother.
**Commentary:** Seeking nourishment from the Mother means valuing simplicity, like an infant without care for drink.

Thus, the earlier text says *"like an infant before it speaks,"* and the *Classic* below says *"the depth of virtue compares to an infant."* This is why I alone differ from others.

The phrase *"without seeking"* was added here.

Moreover, the Sage expounds the *Classic*; originally, there was no avoidance of taboo. Now, when teaching for the age, there may be suspicions. The logic is clear, so the meaning cannot be altered. When facing the text, the phrasing must be stable and convenient. Conveniently preserving the ancient, this is what we should strive for.

Again, Sima Qian said the Old Master spoke over five thousand words, thus clearly showing the depth of his understanding while ceasing speech—not necessarily fixing five thousand as a definite number.

**Exegesis:** These two sentences conclude the passage.

I alone differ from others—differing from the common folk who do not abandon worldly learning, thus contrasting with the earlier *"all seek clarity."*

Ordinary people are attached to desires and action; I alone forget desires and distinctions. Others differentiate among laws; I alone am equal to non-duality, hence the saying.

**Meaning:** At the outset, the two characters *"abandon learning"* are emphasized, lest people fail to suddenly comprehend. Sequentially contrasted, there are eleven distinctions in total:

1. Abandoning learning brings no worry; not abandoning it brings many worries.
2. *"Yielding"* means respectfully responding and doing good; *"flattering"* means arrogantly responding and doing evil.
3. Good is what people praise; evil is what people condemn.
4. The multitude has the splendor of grand feasts and lofty towers; I guard the simplicity of an infant’s conduct.
5. The multitude has destinations; I have nowhere to return.
6. The multitude boasts of excess; I alone seem to have forgotten.
7. The common folk shine brightly and clearly; I alone am dim and dark.
8. The common folk sharpen laws and ordinances; I alone am broad and magnanimous.
9. The multitude has fixations; I alone have no attachments.
10. The multitude all have actions; I alone seem insufficient.
11. The multitude indulge in honor and taste; I alone nourish the Original Harmony.

These eleven distinctions contrast with the worldly, clearly showing that worldly learning can be abandoned and *wuwei* can be practiced.

Thus, the exegesis says: The multitude has attachments; I alone forget desires. The multitude distinguishes among laws; I alone have no duality—this is why I differ from others.

**Exegesis:** The Old Master warns people to preserve simplicity and wholeness, reduce private desires, cut off indulgence in sights and sounds, and block the pursuit of fame—ordering them to be like infants, only seeking nourishment from the Mother.

Thus, it says *"and yet I value seeking nourishment from the Mother."*

**Meaning:** Conduct like an infant’s—no external entanglements, only knowing to seek nourishment from the Mother, without the burden of strife.

This is the Sage’s explanation; now its logic is detailed.

*"Mother"* is *qi*. Human nature, endowed by *qi*, is nourished by *qi*, hence called Mother.

Among the eleven distinctions, all clarify that worldly learning is unbeneficial to the body—those practicing the Dao must all abandon it, acting differently from the worldly.

Thus, it says *"I alone differ from others."*

Having already abandoned worldly learning, one only feeds on *qi* and harmonizes, returning to the root and reviving the vital breath—this is the method of practice.

The *Huangting Classic* says:
*"All eat grains and the five flavors,
I eat the Great Harmony of yin and yang."*

Again:
*"The grains and fruits are the earth’s essence,
The five flavors’ external beauty is demonic and rank—
Their stench disrupts the spirit’s clarity, wasting the prenatal breath.
How could one reverse aging and return to infancy?
Why not eat the pure *qi* of Great Harmony,
Thus able to never die and enter Yellow Tranquility?"*

*The Family Sayings* states: *"Those who eat *qi* are spiritually clear and long-lived."* The logic is without doubt.

In summary, governing the state lies in guarding stillness and silence, removing licentiousness and harshness.

The sovereign who follows the Dao dwells in simplicity, while ministers uphold virtue and expand the Way.

What precedes is the principle of cultivating one’s self; this is the rule for governing the state.

*Comprehensive Commentary on the True Scripture of Dao and Virtue, Volume Eighteen complete*
*Comprehensive Commentary on the True Scripture of Dao and Virtue, Volume Nineteen*
*Narrated by Master Guangcheng Du Guangting of the Tang Dynasty*
*Chapter Twenty-One: The Form of Great Virtue*

**Exegesis:**
The previous chapter clarifies the fear of severing worldly learning, as if in darkness, thus standing apart from others. This chapter elucidates that following the true Dao in its utmost sincerity allows one to transcend the multitude.

The opening two lines, *"The Form of Great Virtue,"* declare that the virtuous person conforms to the Dao. The ten lines following, *"The Dao as such,"* expound upon the profound essence of its truth. The five lines beginning *"From ancient times,"* distinguish the names of application and conclude with the virtue of spontaneous generation.

**Meaning:**
Previously, worldly learning was contrasted as stagnant, demonstrating the path of abandonment. Here, the supreme Dao is revealed as neither vague nor fleeting—it is the ultimate refuge of the true, the origin of the multitude. The Form of Great Virtue follows the Dao alone.

**Annotation:**
*Kong* means "uttermost."
*From* means "to conform."

When asked of one possessing the utmost virtue—what is their bearing?—it is said that their conduct follows only the Dao of utmost emptiness.

**Exegesis:**
*Kong*, utmost.
*From*, to conform.
*Container*, bearing.

To elucidate how one of profound virtue aligns with the Dao, it is asked: *"How does one of utmost virtue manifest?"*

The answer is: *"Their bearing follows only the Dao of utmost emptiness."*

**Meaning:**
The Dao has no name—only virtue reveals it. Virtue has no origin; it arises from the Dao itself. Those who attain the Dao can conform to it, and thus their virtue becomes manifest.

Therefore, one of utmost virtue is simply one who can conform to the Dao.

When the Sage-Emperor or sovereign rules the world, they rely on conforming to the Dao to attain exalted status, governing all within the realm, and must embrace the Dao to establish their foundation.

Thus, the *Book of Documents*—both the *Yao De* and *Shun De*—state: *"If one examines the ancient Dao,"* meaning to follow the Dao of antiquity.

The Dao, as a thing, is but **formless and elusive**.

**Annotation:**
This clarifies that the Dao from which utmost virtue arises is neither existent nor nonexistent—its boundless application defies naming—hence, it is called formless and elusive.

**Exegesis:**
The Dao, as a thing, is formless and elusive—how does it move and shape? It is said that this profound origin is neither existent nor nonexistent, and its nature is difficult to name. If one says it is existent, it is **still and without form**; if one says it is nonexistent, it **permeates like a presence**.

As it is nonexistent yet difficult to name, it is called formless and elusive.

**Meaning:**
Formless and elusive—neither nonexistent nor existent, neither existent nor nonexistent. If one calls it existent, it cannot be grasped; if one calls it nonexistent, it responds to myriad transformations.

**Meaning:**
The Dao is the term for **uttermost emptiness**. Though utterly empty, it opens and connects with all things, hence it is called the Dao—nothing is excluded, nothing is obstructed. If it were to exist as a thing, it would be hindered by materiality and could not persistently connect.

The Dao, being utter emptiness in essence, is not truly nonexistent—yet it envelops heaven and earth, illuminates sun and moon, brings winter cold and summer heat, births spring and ends autumn, and all phenomena move in accordance with the Dao. Thus, it cannot be said to be nonexistent.

But when one probes its operations and examines its generation, does one see what it accomplishes, or know how it transforms? It cannot be said to be existent.

It is **existence within nonexistence, nonexistence within existence**—one cannot point to it and define its name, hence it is called formless and elusive.

**Elusive and formless**, yet within it are traces.

**Annotation:**
Elusive—nonexistence. Formless—existence. The appearance of traces means that from nonexistence, it descends into existence, revealing all things within.

**Exegesis:**
This reveals the origin of generation. Elusive—nonexistence. Formless—existence. The appearance of traces: the profound origin is without form, hence called elusive. Generation and transformation bring forth existence, hence called formless.

Thus, from nonexistence it descends into existence, revealing all phenomena within—from origin to trace.

**Meaning:**
From above to below is called descent. The Dao of the profound origin emerges from utter emptiness. The body of utter emptiness is clear and insubstantial, yet when it generates and transforms all things, it deploys the Dao’s divine function—within the boundless mystery, it births wondrous existence.

Wondrous existence, fused and transformed, descends from above to below into the human world, revealing all phenomena. The profound origin is the root, wondrous existence is the trace—root everlastingly present, trace ever the means of generation and use.

Thus, all phenomena arise from the Dao, all forms are its offspring.

**Elusive and formless**, yet within it are things.

**Annotation:**
Things—referring to the Dao’s formless and elusive nature, as previously described. From existence, they return to nonexistence, thus restoring the Dao—hence, *"within it are things."*

**Exegesis:**
Things—referring to the Dao’s formless and elusive nature, meaning the profound origin. The profound origin descends to generate, revealing all phenomena. When one cultivates their nature and returns to virtue, they revert to nonexistence.

Nonexistence is the Dao itself.

**Meaning:**
Things are the traces of the formless and elusive origin, the traces of wondrous existence. Having descended from root to trace, the Dao generates all dharmas. Following the trace to return to the root, all dharmas revert to the Dao.

It is said that wondrous existence returns to formless and elusive nonexistence—without beginning or end, ever generating and ever transforming.

**Exegesis:**
When one cultivates their nature and returns to virtue, they do not depart from the profound origin. From existence, they return to nonexistence, merging once more with the Dao—hence, *"within it are things."*

It is said that there is wondrous substance, which encompasses the traces to return to the root.

**Meaning:**
The nature one receives from the Dao is called innate nature; the shifts of nature are called emotions. If one restrains emotions and severs thoughts, returning to innate nature and the source, they become a paragon of utmost virtue.

The root of utmost virtue is the wondrous Dao. Hence, it is said that cultivating nature and returning to virtue is to go from existence to nonexistence.

Emotions are existence; restraining emotions and returning to the root is nonexistence. Having severed false emotions and returned to true nature, true nature preserves all virtue—virtue is the Dao’s stage.

This is to merge once more with the Dao. Merging—契合—is to align perfectly.

Wondrous substance is the Dao, hence *"encompassing traces to return to the root."* This is to encompass the traces of existence and return to nonexistence as the root.

**Obscure and merged**, yet within it is essence.

**Annotation:**
Formless and elusive—existence and nonexistence. Obscure and merged—profound mystery, beyond measure. The profound origin descends to generate, cultivates nature and returns to virtue, encompassing traces to return to the root—wondrous substance abides in nonexistence. Obscure and merged are profound mysteries, unquantifiable.

Yet within them, the utmost essence is contained. Hence, *"within it is essence."*

**Exegesis:**
**Meaning:**
First, the profound origin descends to generate, revealing existence from nonexistence. Then, it encompasses traces and returns to the root, reverting existence to nonexistence.

This concludes the two phases as beginning and end, lest the world be confused: the Dao does not cease. If one clings to existence, nonexistence must follow; if one clings to nonexistence, existence must arise. Both sides are stagnant—one fails to grasp the Middle Way.

Thus it is shown: *"Within it is essence"*—most true, most trustworthy.
This reveals the wondrous Dao, ever-present yet neither beginning nor ending.

When one penetrates the profound words, one attains the Middle Way.

Further elucidating the gate of generation and transformation:
The *huanghu* [恍惚] form—this is the clear and void *qi*.
Above, it becomes Heaven.
The *huanghu* substance—this is the thick and turbid *qi*.
Below, it becomes Earth.
The *yaoming* [杳冥] essence—this is the pure and harmonious *qi*.
These three *qi* interact and coalesce, forming humanity.

Humanity—among the Three Powers, the most refined and intelligent.
They follow Heaven’s law and Earth’s model, capable of all things,
Yet they too arise from the wondrous origin’s divided *qi*.
If they lose their nature and indulge their passions, they stray from their root and perish;
If they cultivate their nature and return to virtue, they attain the Dao and ascend.

The pure and harmonious *qi* inhered within them—when cultivated, it endures.
Its essence is most true; within it is trustworthiness.

**Exegesis:**
The *yaoming* essence is originally unadulterated.
When things respond, it manifests; its responses are never amiss.
Thus it is said to be trustworthy.

**Commentary:**
The supreme Dao’s wondrous substance is inherently unadulterated.
Its transformations are most refined, hence its essence is most true.
Its generative function pervades all beings;
when things respond, it never fails to manifest—never errs.
Thus it is said to be most trustworthy.

**Meaning:**
*"Being"* refers to reaching; *"difference"* means deviation; *"err"* means failure.
The Dao’s utmost subtlety is profound and penetrating—
it cannot be ascribed to existence, nor can it be likened to nonexistence.
Beyond this, it is not called the Dao—how could any *dharma* be mixed within it?
It may truly be called *Dao*.

Its transformative function is boundless, its responses unfathomable.
Thus it is most refined, most trustworthy.

The *Shang Shu* says: *"Human heart alone is perilous; Dao-heart alone is subtle.
Only the refined, the singular—this is it."*

From ancient times to today, its name does not fade.

**Exegesis:**
The Dao, from ancient times to today, generates all things.
Things obtain the Dao’s use, and through use, names are established.
The generative use is the same through ages;
the names of its responses thus do not fade.
This is to measure all origins.

**Commentary:**
*"Measure"* means to survey and assess; *"origin"* means beginning.
The supreme Dao’s responses survey all things’ origins,
allowing each to fulfill its generative use.

**Commentary:**
The Dao’s generative function is rooted in the true, refined, and trustworthy.
Its beginning and end are boundless, unchanging through ages.
Thus, the names and uses of things—whether Heaven’s clarity or Earth’s tranquility—
remain constant from ancient times to today.
Hence it is said: *"The generative use is the same through ages."*

By this true, refined, and trustworthy essence,
all things’ origins are surveyed,
each fulfilling its generative use.

**Meaning:**
As previously explained: Heaven’s canopy, Earth’s load,
the sun’s illumination, the moon’s attendance—
all are the Dao’s use with them.
Heaven’s clarity, Earth’s tranquility, valleys’ fullness, things’ growth—
all are the Dao’s names bestowed upon them.
These names and uses remain unaltered through ages;
its trustworthiness and refinement are ever-present from ancient to modern times.
It does not proclaim its function over all beings,
but rather bestows its use upon all things—
yet who among them perceives its beginning and end?
It is the master of transformation—profound, wondrous.
How do I know the origins are thus?
*By this.*

**Exegesis:**
*By this*—that all things today inherit the Dao’s wondrous use in generation.

**Commentary:**
Further elaborating: How do I know that all things’ origins
rely on inheriting from the Dao, which surveys and assesses them,
allowing each to fulfill its generative use?
The answer is: *By this.*
*By this*—by its most true, most trustworthy nature.
All things today inherit the wondrous use in generation—
thus I know it.

**Meaning:**
The Dao nurtures myriad differences,
surveys all classes,
as the origin of things, the first of transformations.
Heaven is clear through it, Earth is tranquil through it,
all things live through it, the sun and moon shine through it.
It is thus—how do I know?
Because its refinement and trustworthiness are unchanging through ages,
and things inherit the Dao as their origin.

Thus, the greatest *virtue* is Heaven and Earth;
the most luminous symbol is the sun and moon;
those who use the Dao to model Heaven are the sovereigns.

Sovereigns, rich with all under Heaven,
enthroned in the central realm,
nurturing myriad lives,
leading all things,
calm and tranquil like Earth,
broad and encompassing like Heaven,
their officials modeling the Four Seasons,
their rewards and punishments clear like autumn and summer,
yet they embody the Dao’s purity and non-action,
governing with utmost benevolence,
demonstrating utmost trustworthiness,
teaching all beings that the Dao is the origin,
each abandoning superficiality to return to the root,
knowing the Dao as their ancestral lineage,
yearning to restore sincerity and return to simplicity.
Their grand designs are firmly established,
their profound transformations flourish.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: *Qu* [曲] as the Whole**

**Commentary:**
The previous chapter clarified that following the Dao’s true nature comprehensively
enables one to survey all origins.
This chapter demonstrates that embracing unity as the standard—
not contending—is how *qu* [曲] achieves completeness.
The first six lines show the conduct of sincerity and completeness,
which then illuminate the sage’s conduct below.
The next four lines further explain how *qu* leads to completeness and avoids ruin.

Only by ceasing contention does one achieve completeness and return.

**Meaning:**
Having already expounded the wondrous Dao’s vast and expansive transformative function,
this now demonstrates the principle of completeness,
teaching the method of cultivation.
*Qu* [曲], bending; *wang* [枉], crookedness; *wa* [洼], depression; *pi* [弊], exhaustion—
all arise from humility yet increase brilliance.
Embracing unity as the law,
we now clarify that minimal ability governs the multitude.

Abandon the traces of self-perception and self-righteousness,
eliminate the faults of self-conceit and self-praise—
only then can one achieve sincerity and completeness,
far surpassing those who contend.

**曲则全**
*Commentary:* Bend oneself to meet the demands of duty, and thus achieve completeness.
*Exegesis:* *Qu* [曲] means to yield flexibly and comply.
When one can yield flexibly and comply with others,
not opposing them in their ways,
then one can preserve oneself—
hence, *qu* then *quan* [全].

**Meaning:**
The Way of governing oneself begins with governing the heart.
The governance of the heart lies in the Dao.
When one attains the Dao, the heart is governed;
when one loses the Dao, the heart is disordered.
A governed heart practices humility and yielding,
a disordered heart engages in contention and self-justification.
Humility and yielding mean bending oneself to comply with others,
while contention means adornment of the self and denial of faults.
Those who bend themselves and comply do not oppose others,
and others will comply in turn.
Bending oneself preserves others,
and others will preserve one in return.
Not contending with others is the Way of preserving oneself.

The *Shàngshū* [尚书] states:
*"If all under heaven have faults, let them rest with me alone.
If I alone have faults, I cannot impose them upon all under heaven."*
This is the Way of the sovereign bending himself and taking responsibility.

**枉则直**
*Commentary:* Bend oneself to rectify others, and thus become straight.
*Exegesis:* *Wang* [枉] means to endure wrong from others.
*Zhi* [直] means to correct what is bent.
The *Chūnqiū* [春秋] says: *"To correct what is bent is to be straight."*
Though one does not oppose others,
when others wrong them and they endure it,
the wrongdoer will feel shame and self-correct—
thus, one’s straightness can rectify what is bent,
hence, *wang* then *zhi* [直].

**Meaning:**
The heart of one who attains the Dao does not oppose others.
When others wrong them and they endure it,
the wrongdoer will inevitably feel shame
and self-correct.
As with Lián Pó [廉颇] and Lìn Xiàngrú [蔺相如] serving together in Zhào [赵],
Lián Pó held a lower rank than Xiàngrú,
and in anger said:
*"I have served the state with merit,
yet I am placed beneath Xiàngrú—
this is my shame.
When I see him, I will surely humiliate him."*
Xiàngrú, hearing this, always avoided him in his carriage.
His attendants wondered:
*"The Prime Minister fears not mighty Qin,
yet fears Lián Pó—why?"*
Xiàngrú replied:
*"Qin does not dare lightly attack Zhào
because it fears me and Lián Pó.
If I and Lián Pó were to meet,
two tigers would fight—
neither would survive.
This would endanger Zhào and benefit Qin.
I avoid him to preserve the state,
not for my own sake."*
When Lián Pó heard this,
he bore a willow branch and bared his chest in apology.
This is how the wrongdoer was made to fear and self-correct,
demonstrating how one’s straightness can rectify what is bent.

The *Chūnqiū* states:
*"To correct what is bent is to be straight."*
In the seventh year of King Xiāng [襄公],
winter, tenth month,
Jìn’s minister Hàn Xiànzǐ [韩献子] announced his retirement,
and his son Mùzǐ [穆子] Wújì [无忌], though disabled,
was to be established in his place.
Mùzǐ declined, saying:
*"The *Shī* [诗] states:
*'Is it not that I rise early and retire late?*
*It is because my deeds are often exposed.'*
And again:
*'If one does not personally attend to it,*
*the common people will not trust it.'*"*

Mùzǐ said, *"I am unworthy—can I truly decline? Let me instead establish my son Qǐ. He consorts with Tián Sū and Yóu, yet speaks of loving virtue. The *Shī* says:
*'Calm and respectful in your station,
Loving what is straight and upright,
The spirits hear you,
And great blessings attend you.*
To care for the people is virtue,
To be straight and upright is correctness.
This is rectifying one’s own heart.
To rectify what is bent is to be straight—
To rectify others’ crookedness.
The three harmonies constitute virtue.
Virtue, straightness, and correctness—
These three complete humanity.
Thus, the bright spirits hear you,
And great blessings descend upon you.
Would it not be fitting to establish him?"*

On the day *Gēngxū*, the Jin ruler sent Hàn Qǐ to pay respects to Xiànzǐ, who then formally requested retirement. The Jin ruler said that Mùzǐ was virtuous and appointed him as a great officer of the public clan.

*"The low becomes full."* **Note:** *"He who holds to humility is ever full."*
**Citation:** *"Dàowù"* explains: *"Dàowù"* means "hollowed and low." *"Yíng"* means "full." This is a metaphorical saying.
The earth’s hollows and lows—water flows to fill them.
A man who guards humility and yielding—his virtue grows ever brighter.
To be able to bend and yield is to be low;
To be complete and straight is to be full.
Thus it is said: *"The low becomes full."*
**Meaning:** The Dao of the earth transforms fullness into humility, flowing like valleys and streams.
The high gradually lowers, while the low rises higher—
Thus, fullness is transformed, and humility spreads.
Fullness invites change, and height cannot be relied upon;
Humility spreads, and lowliness can be steadfast.
The earth’s hollows gather water to become full;
A man’s humility gathers virtue to shine ever brighter.
*"Guarding humility"* refers to bowing, yielding, and letting—
Never failing in modesty, never violating propriety,
Ever acting with meekness and gentleness—
Thus virtue gathers to him,
Like water filling the earth’s hollows.
Those who can bend and yield, who are low—
All speak of lowering their hearts.
Those who are complete, straight, and full—
All speak of increasing their virtue.
A ruler who governs the state
Accepts filth and embraces impurity,
Honors the lowly and respects the worthy,
And thus all near and far flock to him—
The state then thrives and grows great.

*"Worn becomes new."* **Note:** *"To guard what is worn and thin is to renew daily."*
**Citation:** *"Pí"* means "thin and flawed."
Crookedness, bending, and lowliness—
All are self-imposed thinness and flaw.
To dwell in thinness and flaw,
Others will surely honor you first—
Thus your virtue and conduct renew daily.
Hence it is said: *"Worn becomes new."*
**Meaning:** To dwell in what is thin and flawed—
What people reject.
Yet if I embrace it,
And place myself in what is thin and flawed,
Then all will praise and admire me.
The practitioner of the Dao
Walks where others do not walk,
Learns what others do not learn,
Finds rest where others do not rest,
Takes joy where others do not take joy,
Does what others do not do,
Gains what others cannot gain.
What he walks and does—
Nothing but humility, stillness, simplicity, and contentment—
Thus his virtue shines, and the Dao is fulfilled.
This may be called *virtue and conduct renewing daily.*

*"Few gains, many losses."* **Note:** *"Clinging to One without separation ensures no loss."*
*"Many gains, much confusion."* **Note:** *"Many paths lead to confusion and disorder."*
Thus the Sage embraces One as the model for all under Heaven. **Note:** *"The Sage guards the pure and singular, thus becoming the law for all under Heaven."*
**Citation:** *"This means taking little for oneself."*
He who takes little for himself loses nothing—
Hence *"few gains."*
He who gives much to others invites contention—
Hence *"many losses."*
To cultivate the self is thus;
To cultivate the Dao is likewise—
One must guard the pure and singular,
Preserve the true and unadulterated.
If one seeks many divergent paths,
Confusion and disorder will come—
Thus the lost sheep wanders down many forks,
And life is forfeited through many pursuits.
Therefore the Sage embraces One without separation,
And thus becomes the law for all under Heaven.

**Meaning:** A frugal man can share his wealth—
This shows he takes little for himself.
He who takes little has no greedy heart;
He who has no greedy heart invites no contention;
He who invites no contention gains what he seeks.
He who takes much will not be equitable;
The inequitable invite contention;
Contention leads to loss—
Thus confusion arises.
This parable illustrates the path of cultivation.

The methods of cultivating the Dao are manifold,
Yet the attainment of the Dao lies in guarding One.
He who guards One without loss—
In governing the self, he attains the Dao;
In governing the state, he acts without action.
Without action, things settle into ease.
Thus the Sage embraces One as the law for all under Heaven.

In governing the self, one should not multiply affairs;
In cultivating the Dao, one should not multiply paths.
To multiply affairs—
A myriad thoughts swarm, harming one’s life.
Can life remain unharmed?
Ten thousand archers bend their bows to strike one target—
Can the target remain unhit?
To multiply paths—
Mystic teachings branch in myriad ways,
Alchemical scriptures fill countless volumes.
With one man’s heart burdened by the teachings of sages past,
His form wearies without, his spirit frays within—
Thus he strays ever farther from the Dao.

In governing the state, to multiply affairs—
Jìn’s policies branched in many directions,
Thus the feudal lords did not rally to it;
Qín’s nets were tangled and dense,
Thus all under Heaven’s hearts turned away.
One state, three dukes—
Naturally difficult to govern;
Ten sheep, nine herders—
How can one hope to transform the people?
He who loses his sheep laments the many forks;
He who loses his life blames his many pursuits.
This is the natural order.
*"Not self-aware, yet clear."*

**Annotations:**
注：If one does not reveal one’s own abilities,
and always bends oneself to meet the demands of duty,
then virtue is preserved and clarity naturally arises.

**Commentary (疏):**
This is the inverse explanation of *"curved, thus whole."*
It means: If one does not reveal one’s own excellence,
and always yields and conforms to things,
then one’s complete virtue grows ever clearer—
hence, *"thus clarity."*

**Meaning (义曰):**
If one reveals what is not beautiful,
there will inevitably be a heart of contention and rivalry,
and thus one cannot yield and conform to things.

But if one yields and conforms to things,
never revealing one’s own excellence,
then virtue is preserved and clarity grows ever brighter.

When virtue is complete, the form is complete;
when the form is complete, the *qi* is complete;
when the *qi* is complete, the spirit is complete.

The spirit of one who is wholly complete
has no inner or outer separation—
penetrating the eight extremes,
the clarity of not revealing oneself is vast.

---
**Not self-righteous, thus illustrious.**
**Annotations:**
If one does not presume to be correct,
and instead bends oneself to uphold others,
then one’s rectitude naturally becomes manifest.

**Commentary (疏):**
This is the inverse explanation of *"bent, thus straight."*
It means: If one bears wrongs for others,
never asserting oneself as correct,
there will be no blame.
Thus one’s rectitude naturally becomes evident—
hence, *"thus illustrious."*

**Meaning (义曰):**
If one insists on being correct in a matter,
there will inevitably be a heart of attachment,
and thus one cannot bend oneself to submission.

But if one bends oneself to submission,
never clinging to being correct,
then rectitude shines forth and becomes ever more illustrious.

When rectitude is illustrious, goodness is illustrious;
when goodness is illustrious, virtue is illustrious.

The virtuous one—
all things gather to them;
virtue grows ever brighter,
and the illustriousness of not presuming correctness is vast.

---
**Not self-praising, thus meritorious.**
**Annotations:**
If one does not praise oneself,
then merit returns to them.

**Commentary (疏):**
This is the inverse explanation of *"hollow, thus full."*
It means: If one does not praise oneself,
and instead practices humility,
others will not compete for merit.
Merit returns to them, like earth assisting water—
fullness arises—
hence, *"thus meritorious."*

**Meaning (义曰):**
To boast of one’s own goodness is called *"praising."*
If people love to praise themselves,
they will inevitably have a heart of greed and competition,
and thus cannot humble themselves and guard modesty.

But if one humbles themselves and guards modesty,
never praising their own goodness,
then goodness becomes evident and merit arises.

The meritorious one—
people bear their kindness,
all things receive their blessings;
wherever goodness and merit extend,
who would not rejoice and follow?
Thus the merit of not praising oneself is great.

Yán Huí said: *"May I not praise goodness."*
The *Shàngshū* says: *"You alone do not praise [yourself],*
*and none under Heaven will contend with you for merit."*

This is what is meant.

---
**Not self-glorifying, thus enduring.**
**Annotations:**
If one long endures their own deficiencies,
never glorifying themselves,
then others will extol their virtues.

**Commentary (疏):**
This is the inverse explanation of *"worn, thus renewed."*
If one endures their own deficiencies,
never glorifying themselves,
others will inevitably yield,
and good deeds will grow ever more enduring—
hence, *"thus enduring."*

**Meaning (义曰):**
*"Glorify"* means *"rely upon."*
If one relies on their own virtues,
they will inevitably have a heart of boasting,
and thus cannot place themselves in deficiency.

But if one places themselves in deficiency,
others will naturally extol and beautify them,
and thus the beauty of not glorifying oneself grows ever more enduring.

The *Shàngshū* says: *"You alone do not glorify [yourself],*
*and none under Heaven will contend with you for ability."*

It is only because one does not contend
that none under Heaven can contend with them.

**Annotations:**
Not contending with things—
who would contend with them?

**Commentary (疏):**
All the previous conduct—
bending to wholeness, yielding to rectitude,
humbling to fullness, enduring deficiency—
are all acts of yielding and not contending.
Since gentleness and weakness overcome harshness and strength,
and humility naturally returns to what is straight,
who under Heaven could contend with one who does not contend?

Thus, *"none can contend with them."*

**Meaning (义曰):**
Those who love to contend are not in accord with the Dao.
The virtue of not contending is the greatest virtue.

The four prior acts—
bending to wholeness, yielding to rectitude,
humbling to fullness, enduring deficiency—
are the practices of cultivation.
The four inverses—
not revealing oneself, not presuming correctness,
not praising oneself, not glorifying oneself—
are the manifest fruits of response.
Those who practice the four acts
are humble, gentle, and do not contend with things,
and thus none under Heaven can contend with them,
while attaining the four blessings:
*"thus clarity," "thus illustrious," "thus meritorious," "thus enduring."*

Was the ancient saying *"curved, thus whole"*
an empty phrase?
Indeed, it is whole and returns to its root.

**Annotations:**
The ancients spoke of *"curved, thus whole"*—
was this not an empty claim?
Only those who truly bend
will have the logic of wholeness return to them.

**Commentary (疏):**
This draws upon the ancient saying to conclude *"curved, thus whole."*
It means: The ancients have spoken of this *"curved, thus whole"*—
was this not a true saying without substance?
If one truly yields and conforms without resistance,
then the logic of wholeness naturally returns to them—
hence, *"indeed, whole and returns to its root."*

*"Sincere"* means *"truth."*

**Meaning (义曰):**
The *"curved"* spoken of here
is the curved of gentleness and submission,
not the curved of deceit.

The Sage embraced this *"curved, thus whole"* Dao
to establish it as law under Heaven.
When Heaven is ordered,
the Sage does not reveal their own excellence,
does not presume their own actions,
does not praise their own merit,
does not glorify their own abilities—
all things return to the Sage’s virtue.

The Sage governs with humility and submission,
and thus the virtue of *"curved, thus whole"*
naturally returns.

From ancient times to today,
this saying has endured,
and when practiced, it is certain to take effect—
truly not empty.

But if the ruler embraces one *"bent"* humility,
returns to the root of tranquility,
they will surely display the virtue of wholeness
and attain the Great Peace.

**End of *The Broad Explication of the Daoist Classic’s Sacred Meaning*, Volume Nineteen**
**End of *The Broad Explication of the Daoist Classic’s Sacred Meaning*, Volume Twenty**

「The *Broad Explication* by Master Du Guangting of the *Tang* [Dynasty] elucidates *The Daoist Classic’s Sacred Meaning* in the chapter *"Hesitant Speech, Natural Way"* (Chapter Twenty-Three):

**Explication:** The chapter expounds *"embracing the One"* as the model—
not striving, hence *"curved, thus whole."*

This chapter elucidates *the Dao’s* transcendent silence,
for clinging to words is akin to losing *the Way.*

The first sentence establishes the principle,
the next five employ analogies to clarify instruction—
thus, the meaning is derived from the examples below.

**Meaning:** The Sage’s teaching is not elaborate,
but aligns with *the Way’s* natural order.

When winds and rains rage violently,
they cannot long endure—
*Hesitant Speech* [thus] approaches forgetting speech.

To admonish against violence is to urge its cessation,
and when violence ceases, stillness returns—
*the Way* responds accordingly.

If trust is insufficient,
the people will not heed—
how then can they believe?

Heaven’s violent storms do not persist,
nor can winds and rains be constant—
blaming those who forget speech,
gradually attuning to *the Way’s* natural principle.

Moreover, no vessel is greater than Heaven and Earth,
no authority heavier than the divine.
Even violent winds and sudden rains cannot endure—
how much less can rulers, relying on their exalted station and wealth,
despise the world and oppress the people,
for this is not a lasting path.

Why so? The First Emperor of Qin conquered the four seas,
unified the nine regions,
treated the people of the south like livestock,
regarded the common folk as grass,
and built labyrinthine palaces for his own indulgence.
In his arrogance and excess,
he unleashed violence and ruled with reckless folly,
pursuing boundless luxury and honor—
yet his fate collapsed in an instant.

Xiang Yu [Item] roared across the Central Plains,
devoured the six directions,
with no sovereign above him,
no rival before him—
yet his defeat at the Wu River came swiftly.

The *Laozi* warns against such tyranny,
commanding adherence to *the Way’s* natural, non-action principle.

**Hesitant Speech, Natural Way.**
**Annotation:** *Hesitant Speech* means forgetting speech.
Yet it does not say *"forgetting speech"* but *"hesitant"*—
for *the Way* is articulated through speech,
and cannot be entirely forgotten.

When *the Way* is understood, speech is forgotten—
hence, *"hesitant."*

If one can grasp *the Way* through speech,
not clinging to words,
they will harmonize with *the Way’s* natural order.

**Explication:** This clarifies that teaching cannot be rigidly clung to.
*Hesitant Speech* means forgetting speech.

Speech exists within *the Way*—
those who cling to words have not grasped the teaching.

*The Way* must be conveyed through speech,
and forgetting it entirely would lose the path to enlightenment—
thus, it is said that *the Way* is articulated through speech,
and cannot be entirely forgotten.

When *the Way* is understood, speech is forgotten—
hence, *"hesitant."*

If one can perceive the teaching’s subtle essence
through its spoken form,
not fixating on its superficial aspects,
they will align with *the Way’s* natural order.

Therefore, it is called *"Hesitant Speech, Natural Way."*

**Meaning:** Teaching must rely on speech,
and speech serves to elucidate *the Way.*

Clinging to words while neglecting the teaching
is not the path of enlightenment—
the key lies in forgetting speech to abandon fixation.

Once *the Way* is attained,
not clinging to words reveals the true purpose of speech.

**Annotation:** *"Signs and traps"* [筌蹄]—
*Zhuangzi* says: *"Signs"* are the tools to catch fish,
but once the fish is caught, the signs are forgotten.
*"Traps"* are the tools to catch rabbits,
but once the rabbit is caught, the traps are forgotten.

Speech is the tool to grasp *the Way*’s intent—
when *the Way* is attained, speech is forgotten.
How then could I speak to one who has forgotten speech?

*"Signs"* are made of bamboo,
the implements for catching fish.
*"Traps"* are made of rope,
the implements for catching rabbits.

Once fish and rabbits are obtained,
the signs and traps may be discarded.
If one clings to the signs and traps,
they are no longer fish or rabbits.

If one clings to speech,
it is no longer the teaching’s intent.

Violent winds do not last a morning,
sudden rains do not endure a day.

**Annotation:** When winds and rains are violent and abrupt,
they harm things and cannot persist—
just as clinging to speech obscures *the Way* and breeds confusion.

**Explication:** Violent winds and sudden rains
are metaphors for the teaching’s intent.

Winds disperse, rains nourish—
if they are violent and sudden,
they harm things and cannot endure.

*Qi* sustains the body,
the heart governs the spirit—
if *qi* is violent and sudden,
it harms the body itself.

Governance orders the people,
commands regulate the people—
if governance is harsh and violent,
commands rigid and sudden,
the people scatter and the state falters.

Speech elucidates *the Way*,
and *the Way* propagates the teaching—
if one clings to speech and resists *the Way*,
the teaching will not be implemented,
and *the Way* will not be understood.

**Explication:** This likens speech to the tools of *the Way*—
if one clings to words and resists the teaching,
there is no path to enlightenment,
and one will surely lose *the Way* while falling into confusion.

Thus, winds and rains cannot rage violently,
nor can speech be rigidly clung to.
The analogy of violent winds and sudden rains
illustrates that forgetting speech aligns with *the Way’s* natural order.

**Meaning:** Clinging to speech and teaching
leads to obstruction,
losing the ultimate principle of *the Way*,
and bewilderment in the teaching’s intent.

If one comprehends the purpose of *"signs and traps,"*
they will neither be trapped by fixation
nor harmed by violent excess,
but will manifest the virtues of dispersion and nourishment.

Who embodies this? Heaven and Earth.
Even Heaven and Earth cannot endure violence—
how much less can mortals?

**Annotation:** Heaven and Earth are vast,
yet violent and sudden acts harm things
and cannot persist—
how much more so for humans
who cling to speech and resist the teaching,
losing *the Way* and seeking enlightenment?
Can it be attained?

**Explication:** *"Who"* [孰]—
a rhetorical question asking who could endure violent winds and sudden rains.
The answer: Heaven and Earth.

Heaven and Earth, though vast,
cannot long sustain violent excess—
how much less can ordinary people,
clinging to speech and teaching,
be violent and sudden,
unable to let go and forget,
gradually reaching their limits,
yet still seeking enlightenment?
Can it be attained?

**Meaning:** The *Laozi* illustrates that violent winds and sudden rains cannot last,
using this as an analogy for those who govern, cultivate, and teach.

Fearful that people may not grasp this intent,
it poses the question and answers it itself,
thus clarifying the principle.»

The vastness of Heaven and Earth, though formed, cannot endure violent excess even for a single day. A ruler governing a kingdom, if violent, will harm the people. A practitioner of the *Dao*, if violent, will harm their own cultivation. All such actions are untenable.

Ordinary people, indulging their nature and unrestrained in their hearts, governing with wild ferocity and haste, clinging to speech and fixating on teaching, rigid and unadaptable, confined to a single corner—how could they achieve national prosperity and personal tranquility? It cannot be done.

Thus, those who pursue the *Dao* must not cling to speech and teaching.

**Explication:** *"From"* [从]—to follow, to align with.
The *Dao* is boundless and spontaneous, responding without fixed form. In things, it flows through without obstruction. Therefore, those who seek to embody this mystery and act in accordance must not fixate on anything. Hence, it says, *"those who pursue the *Dao*."*

**Meaning:** The Great *Dao* is harmonious and responsive. Through humility, gentleness, and yielding, one attains it. Rulers who are harsh, fierce, and violent, like the reckless winds and sudden rains, have already lost the *Dao*.

Thus, when a ruler governs with the *Dao* to guide the people, they follow what arises and respond to what moves—all things naturally conform. Great conduct brings great blessings; lesser conduct brings lesser blessings. The depth of response depends on one’s attunement, as seen below.

Those who embody the *Dao* are one with the *Dao*.
**Explication:** Those who follow the *Dao* in their actions are called *"those who embody the *Dao*."* They do not fixate; they transcend speech and teaching, becoming one with the *Dao*. Hence, *"one with the *Dao*."*

**Meaning:** The *Dao* is empty, effortless, serene, yielding, pure, and unadorned—these six are its essence. The empty is its unity; the effortless, its nature; the serene, its mirror; the yielding, its function; the pure and unadorned, its foundation. To embody these six is to embody the *Dao*. When a person’s actions align with the *Dao*, they follow without obstruction, transcend speech, and become one with the *Dao*.

Those who embody *virtue* are one with *virtue*.
**Explication:** *Virtue* is the name for the *Dao* in action. When one embodies the *Dao* without attachment to merit, their deeds align with the *Dao*’s function. Those who truly understand follow the *Dao*, not only liberating themselves but also benefiting all beings. The people receive their *virtue*, yet the practitioner forgets their own merit—all their deeds align with the *Dao*’s function. Hence, *"those who embody *virtue* are one with *virtue*."*

**Meaning:** *Virtue* is the *Dao* in action, thus it follows the *Dao*. The *"great conduct that brings great blessings"* refers to those who align with the *Dao* above. Those who practice moderately benefit all life, their merit extending to the realm, yet they do not reach the highest *Dao* but surpass conventional *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness). All things fulfill their nature, each receiving what they deserve—thus it is called *virtue*. Those whose *virtue* extends to others are nearly one with the *Dao*.

The lost are one with the lost.
**Explication:** Clinging to speech and fixating on teaching, one cannot attain enlightenment. Without enlightenment, one strays from the *Dao*—hence, *"one with the lost."*

**Meaning:** Speech and teaching are tools to grasp the *Dao*, like the *qi* (woven basket) and *ti* (noose) used to catch fish and rabbits. The *qi* encases the fish to bring it whole; the *ti* binds the rabbit’s feet to bring it intact. Yet fools, unaware that the tools serve only to catch, mistake them for the fish and rabbits themselves—how far they stray! Speech is used to proclaim principle; teaching, to instruct others. The *Dao* cannot be attained without speech to proclaim it; law cannot be understood without teaching to convey it. Yet fools, unaware that speech and teaching are mere guides, mistake them for the *Dao* itself—how far they stray!

Only through supreme emptiness and stillness can the *Dao* be gathered. Fixating on speech and binding oneself to teaching—how could this ever grasp the truth? Supreme emptiness forgets speech; supreme stillness forgets teaching—nothing must be clung to. The *Classic* says: *"The clinging one loses it."* Those one with the *Dao* attain the *Dao*; those one with *virtue* attain *virtue*; those one with loss attain loss.

**Explication:** Compare drawing water with a ladle, igniting fire with a concave mirror, or classifying things by their kind—then the distinction is clear. The *qi* of like things responds in kind: the tiger’s roar stirs the wind, the crane’s cry is answered by its young. Yet differing natures produce conflicting responses—liver and gall differ like Chu and Yue. When the *Dao* aligns, even barbarians and the civilized become one people. Things naturally follow their kind; none resist.

**Meaning:** Through stillness, the *Dao* descends; through accumulated merit, *virtue* fills. The resonance of *qi* is ancient and profound.

「Thus, when the *gong* is struck, the *gong* resonates; when the *jiao* is struck, the *jiao* responds—this is the resonance of sounds. The withered mulberry moves and the sky wind arises; the summer rain descends and the stone foundation grows moist—this is the resonance of *qi*. The dragon’s roar summons clouds, the tiger’s bellow generates wind—living things respond to the lifeless. The copper mountain collapses and the bells toll in reply—like things resonate in kind. The reeds’ ashes are stirred and their shadows wane—events resonate with their causes. The crane’s cry is answered by its young—natures resonate with their own. Accumulated goodness brings lingering blessings; accumulated evil invites lingering calamities—actions resonate with their consequences. Sharing a boat and crossing together, the Hu and Yue need not fear divergent hearts—circumstances resonate with their own. Moisture flows toward dryness; the lifeless responds to the lifeless.

The *Sutra of Western Ascension* says: *"Do good, and good *qi* comes; do evil, and evil *qi* comes."* Those aligned with loss shall surely meet their arrows. The liver and gall of Chu and Yue differ—this is the division of natures. The Hu and Yue become one people when their aspirations align. The noble share winds across a thousand *li*; the petty differ in customs even across a single lane. Is this not what is meant?

**Explication:** Just as the *fangzhu* collects moonlight and water flows, the *yangying* reflects sunlight and fire is kindled. Hence it is said: *"Those aligned with the Dao attain the Dao."* **Meaning:** In the eastern seas lies a giant clam called *fangzhu*, its shell measuring two *cun* in length. If one polishes its shell with soft silk for a long time, then shines moonlight upon it and collects the dew in a vessel, water will be obtained. The *yangying* is a tool for melting gold, shaped like a cup or resembling a mirror. If one cleanses it with black silk and shines sunlight upon it, then places a stalk of mugwort beneath it, fire will be kindled. These two methods rely on the light of the sun and moon, harnessing the resonance of *qi* to produce water and fire. In ancient times, sacrificial rites emphasized purity, and it was required to offer water from the *fangzhu* and fire from the *yangying* to the divine.

Even lifeless things can be moved by resonance and response—how much more so the most refined and responsive of beings, humans? The Dao is boundless in its transformations, and can it not be evoked by resonance? It can be attained. Yet if one’s faith is insufficient, there will be no response.

**Explication:** When people cannot grasp and verify the truth, forgetting all words, it is because their faith and understanding are inadequate, leading to confusion and stagnation. Once confusion and stagnation arise, they cling to words in seeking enlightenment; clinging to words in seeking enlightenment only deepens their bewilderment, and thus they fall into doubt—this is what is meant by *"no response."*

**Meaning:** The Dao is formless and stateless; it is attained through refined perception and response. Yet merely speaking of refined perception leaves no path for people to realize it, so the text elaborates on the myriad instances of resonance and response to encourage them. It seeks to make all people know that things have their resonances, events their causes, and only then can they sincerely devote themselves to the Dao. If one sincerely devotes the heart and steadfastly believes, quietly resting in stillness and tranquility, how could the Dao not respond? The reason it does not respond is that people cannot still their minds or calm their aspirations.

The wise cling to words and limit themselves to teachings; the doubtful oscillate between presence and absence. Faith being insufficient, there is no resonance or response—this is *"no response."* Those who begin with sharp focus but grow slack in practice, abandoning their resolve in a single thought, forfeit all their prior efforts. Unable to concentrate with single-minded devotion and persevere long, they claim the Great Dao deceives them. If one truly knows the Dao and practices it diligently over time, the profound insight will not be distant—how could there be no response?

The sovereign follows the Dao and transforms the people; with faith, he governs his subjects. Devoting sincerity to all things, spreading virtue like springtime, a sovereign who sincerely devotes himself will have no subjects who doubt.

**Chapter XXIV: The Upright Do Not Stand Firm**

**Explication:** The previous chapter explained that clinging to words and teachings, failing to grasp the truth, aligns one with loss. This chapter expounds that self-conceit and boasting cause things to turn against one.

The first two sentences present analogies to illustrate the difficulty of attainment. The next four sentences clarify that even if one seeks it, one will not obtain it.

The passage below will further admonish and encourage, urging those with the Dao not to fall into such errors.

**Meaning:** The earlier text spoke of insufficient faith leading to doubt about the Dao. Now it further states that those who strain to seek its practice or cling to its duration, boast of their own insights, and arrogantly flaunt their virtues—these only distance themselves from the Dao. It is like lingering food or superfluous limbs; how could one attain the profound unity of the Dao?

Thus, those with the Dao do not indulge in such behavior, and practitioners of the True Way take this as a warning.

The upright do not stand firm; those who straddle do not walk.

**Explication:** *Qì* means to lift the heel and gaze afar; *kuà* means to straddle while carrying something. These are analogies.

To stretch the neck and lift the heel, desiring to gaze far, is perilous—one cannot stand long. To straddle while carrying something, the object becomes an obstruction. If the object obstructs, one cannot walk, just as all beings who cling to their own insights and boast of their own virtues do.

Thus, to lift the heel is to not stand; to straddle is to not walk. Self-conceit leads to confusion; self-righteousness leads to obscurity. The distinction is clear.

**Meaning:** To point with the feet and step upon the ground is called *qì*; to stretch the neck and lift the heel is the phrase used by Chen Hou in the *Longmen Fu* to express hope for imperial favor. To straddle while carrying something and seek to walk far is also unattainable.

It illustrates how people cannot sincerely devote their hearts to the True Way, harboring doubts about the Dao. They may briefly arise with a single thought, hoping for immediate success, yet lacking the profound stillness and tranquil devotion, lacking the gradual refinement of body and mind, and desiring to shake off their garments in triumph, to meet with those of like spirit—this is like striving to stand upright or walk while straddling, hoping for endurance. Those who cling to their own insights...」

「Commentary: Those who flaunt their talents and exalt themselves, who act only to be noticed for their faults, thus fail to attain true clarity.

**Meaning:** The words say: When the Sage’s virtue shines, their spirit permeates all four directions, extending without limit—reaching upward to the heavens and downward to the earth. Yet it remains as vast and boundless as water, neither grasping nor claiming it as their own. Common people, however, obscure others’ brilliance with their own shallow perceptions, revealing only their trifling abilities and boasting of fleeting merits, deeming this as true enlightenment. Can such a thing endure?

Those who insist on their own righteousness alone will never be renowned.

**Commentary:** To insist on one’s own correctness while ignoring others’ is to court resentment. Thus, they will never be renowned.

**Meaning:** The Sage’s conduct is such that inwardly they cultivate their essence, outwardly they suppress superficial displays. They align their spirit and restrain their knowledge, acting without action yet achieving all things, as if effortlessly empty—never claiming credit for what is done. Common people, however, use their own virtues to overshadow others’ merits, striving to stand out, laboring to boast, and taking this as their own achievement. Can such conduct truly flourish?

Those who arrogantly take credit for their deeds will gain no lasting merit.

**Commentary:** To cling stubbornly to one’s own achievements, demanding recognition while others refuse to acknowledge them, is why no lasting merit is attained.

**Meaning:** The Sage’s works are like the heavens as a shelter—covering all without exclusion. Like the earth as a chariot—bearing all without burden. The four seasons as steeds—serving all without fail. Yin and Yang as drivers—fulfilling all without effort. Yet they regard these as the natural unfolding of things, never claiming them as their own merit. Common people, however, use their own superficial virtues to eclipse others’ true abilities, harboring pride inwardly while showing no humility outwardly, taking this as their own achievement. Can such a thing be complete?

The Sage’s virtue, though profound, appears as if in simplicity—like the foolishness of old. The *Records of the Historian* says: *"The virtuous person, though full of virtue, looks as if lacking in wisdom."* The *Analects* says: *"The Master [Confucius]’s disciple Yan Hui was always like a simpleton all day long."* This is what is meant.

As for their relation to the Dao, it is called *excessive food* and *superfluous growths*—like leftover scraps and diseased tumors. Leftover scraps are foul to eat; diseased tumors are afflictions of the body. Such conduct—self-flattery, self-righteousness, and the like—when examined in terms of the Dao, is likened to foul leftovers and diseased growths, universally detested.

**Meaning:** The four flaws—*self-flattery*, *self-righteousness*, *self-credit*, and *self-boasting*—hinder the cultivation of the Dao. Compared to things, they are like foul leftovers, and when taken from the body, like diseased growths. Diseased growths are like knots of illness; superfluous flesh is like tumors. They are also like foul leftovers, universally despised.

The term *superfluous growths* refers to these flaws—self-flattery, self-righteousness, and the like—as the diseased growths of virtue and conduct, hence the phrase *superfluous growths*. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* says: *"People will not eat my leftovers,"* and *Zhuangzi* says: *"Excessive growths and dependent tumors protrude from the body, yet they are extravagant in nature."*

**Meaning:** To accumulate benevolence is true virtue; to emulate the worthy is true conduct. Self-flattery and self-righteousness are not the accumulation of benevolence. Self-credit and self-boasting are not the emulation of the worthy. When applied to virtue and conduct, are these not worse than the afflictions of diseased growths?

*"People will not eat my leftovers"*—from the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Zhuang of Lu’s sixth year, when King Wen of Chu attacked the state of Shen and passed through Deng, the Lord of Deng said: *"He is my nephew."* The king halted and feasted him.

The three nephews—**Qí**’s nephews **Cuì**, **Dān**, and **Yǎng**—requested permission to kill the Chu prince. The Lord of Qí refused.

The three nephews said: *"The one who will destroy Qí must be this man. If we do not act now, it will be too late—like gnawing at one’s own navel."* They urged: *"Act now, for this is the opportune moment!"*

The Lord of Qí replied: *"People will not eat my leftovers."* He meant that harming his own nephews would make him despised by others.

They responded: *"If you do not heed our words, how will the ancestral temples receive their offerings? Where will you take your surplus then?"*

He did not comply. After conquering Shen, Chu turned and attacked Qí. In the sixteenth year, Chu attacked again and annihilated it—this was the same year as Duke Zhuang’s sixteenth year.

As for *"dependent tumors and protruding growths,"* the *Zhuangzi*’s Outer Chapters state:
*"Dependent tumors and protruding growths emerge from the body, yet they exceed what is natural."* It means that what is long is not truly excess, and what is short is not truly deficient. Growths and tumors arise from the body, yet they are not inherent to nature. Among the multitude, they are considered excessive—hence, *"excess."* Excess means *abundance.* Since some things are reviled, those who follow the Dao do not dwell in them.

**Commentary:** Self-flattery and self-righteousness, when practiced in the Dao, are likened to leftover food and diseased growths. Even ordinary things may be reviled, so how much more so for those who follow the Way?

**Meaning:** Accumulating benevolence is virtue; cultivating goodness is conduct. Those who follow the Dao refine their conduct and accumulate virtue, and upon attaining fruition, they forget these very things, aligning with the Great Unity and returning to the formless. How much less would they dwell in these four afflictions—like dependent tumors or leftover food—when such things are so repugnant?

These four afflictions, when applied to personal cultivation, undermine virtue and harm nature; when applied to governance, they reject counsel and boast of self, disrupting administration and harming the people—root causes of ruin. How can they be compared to the ugliness of leftover food or diseased growths?

**Volume Twenty-One: *The Broad Explication of the Dao and Its Virtue* #25**
**Chapter: "The Mysterious Unity of the Primordial Thing"**

---

**Exposition:**
The previous chapter expounded upon self-perception and self-righteousness, declaring them as leftover food and superfluous actions in the Dao. It concludes with, *"Those who follow the Dao do not dwell therein."* This chapter elucidates the Great Unity as *"passing"* (逝), affirming that the essence of the Dao is the primordial, undifferentiated unity, culminating in the spontaneous manifestation of the Way.

First, it establishes *"The Mysterious Unity of the Primordial Thing"* in six verses, revealing the origin of the wondrous source and how all things are imbued with its function. Next, it states, *"I do not know its name"* in six verses, demonstrating the futility of forced nomenclature, for names are ultimately unattainable. Thus, the following six verses on the Dao elucidate the generation of the Four Great Elements and admonish the sovereign’s governance. Finally, the chapter concludes by teaching that the Way manifests spontaneously—requiring only non-action and tranquility.

**Meaning:**
In antiquity, before the Three Qi were divided and the One Principle established, form and substance remained concealed, indistinct and unfathomable. Yet, from this boundless void emerged the sole origin—the peerless, supreme mystery. When the divine essence spread and transformation unfolded, heaven and earth were born, and all things were nurtured. As the source of all generation and completion, it is the *Mother of Transformation*.

Only then were distinctions of name and reality defined, revealing its functions—now vast, now fleeting; now distant, now returning. It encompasses the Three Realms (heaven, earth, humanity) and governs the Qi, initiating the Four Great Elements and assuming preeminence. Through successive ordinances, it establishes laws, yet remains undifferentiated and ungoverned, silently embodying the natural. It proclaims the boundless efficacy of the Dao, and upon completion, returns to its original source.

*"The Mysterious Unity of the Primordial Thing"* is the Dao’s essence.
*"Before heaven and earth it was born"* is the Dao’s origin.
*"Silent and boundless"* is the Dao’s substance.
*"Independent yet unchanging"* is the Dao’s constancy.
*"Circulating without peril"* is the Dao’s function.
*"It can be the mother of all under heaven"* is the Dao’s efficacy.

*"I do not know its name"* is the Dao’s non-existence.
*"It is called the Dao"* is the Dao’s existence.
*"Forcibly named ‘Great’"* is the Dao’s body.
*"The Great is ‘passing’"* is the Dao’s subtlety.
*"Passing is ‘distant’"* is the Dao’s profound mystery.
*"Distant is ‘returning’"* is the Dao’s eternal presence.

*"The Dao is vast, heaven is vast, earth is vast, the sovereign is vast"*—this declares the Dao’s dominion over the Three Realms.
*"Within the realm, the Four Great Elements exist, with the sovereign occupying one"*—this clarifies that the sovereign is the most enlightened leader and must align with the Dao.

The Three Realms follow its pattern; thus, the sovereign must govern by the Dao’s movement and harmonize with nature. Hence, the exposition admonishes the sovereign to follow the Dao, modeling the Way after heaven, and upholding tranquility.

**Exposition on *"The Mysterious Unity of the Primordial Thing, before heaven and earth it was born"*:**
To clarify how the Dao acquired its name, it is said that this mysterious unity spontaneously coalesced, containing all things within it. Tracing its generative transformation reveals its existence prior to heaven and earth.

*"The Mysterious Unity"* refers to the wondrous substance—the very *Peak of the Void*—and to further explain the origin of forced nomenclature, it is called *"the Primordial Thing."* It speaks of this wondrous substance spontaneously forming, encompassing all phenomena, and tracing its generative transformation to its origin before heaven and earth. Thus, it is said: *"Before heaven and earth it was born."*

**Meaning:**
The Dao’s emergence has no origin or ancestor, no name or form. It is boundless yet functional, gradually manifesting in existence. At its inception, it appeared as a form without form, an image without image, a thing without substance, a name without designation. Before heaven and earth were established, before yin and yang were divided, and before purity and turbidity were distinguished, it was a seamless, circular unity. It contained all forms within yet remained indistinct, harboring all transformations yet unrevealed. It could not be constrained by names or described by images. Thus, it is said: *"The Mysterious Unity of the Primordial Thing, before heaven and earth it was born."*

The *Nine Heaven Scripture* states:
*"Before heaven and earth existed, the Dao-Qi was first—called the Primordial Three Qi—which gave rise to the Three Pure Ones. Each Pure One generated three Qi, combining into nine Qi, forming the Nine Heavens. Only then did distinctions arise—between round purity and square turbidity, solar yang and lunar yin—and thus the Three Realms emerged, and all classes were established."*

Among all scriptures, this principle is universally acknowledged. Therefore, *"before heaven and earth it was born"* refers to the Great Dao.

Regarding the succession of the Five Great (likely referring to the Five Phases or transformations), see Volume Eight for the explanation of the *Taoist Canon’s* "Knowing the Manifest and the Mysterious."

**Silent and boundless, independent yet unchanging, circulating without peril—**
**Exposition:**
*"Silent and boundless"* sighs at the boundless, tranquil essence of the Primordial Thing—the wondrous source, serene and ever-present. Thus, it stands alone, unaltered. Yet, when things respond to it, it acts without intention, permeating all existence. Hence, it circulates without danger.

**Meaning:**
*"Silent and boundless"* means *non-existence*. It has no sound to hear, no color to see, no form to grasp, no image to seek, no name to invoke, no law to emulate. Thus, it is said: *"Silent and boundless."*

*"Independent"* means the Dao stands alone, uninitiated.
*"Circulating"* means its Qi spreads universally.
*"Without peril"* means it is neither high nor low, neither vast nor confined—boundless and inexhaustible, perpetually mysterious and enduring, never in jeopardy. *Peril* means *danger*.

*"It can be the mother of all under heaven."*
**Annotation:**
The boundless, tranquil essence of the Primordial Thing is the wondrous source, perpetually serene. It stands alone, unchanging, yet its influence permeates all existence. Thus, all things derive sustenance from its nurturing virtue, making it the mother of all under heaven.

**Exposition:**
The wondrous source generates and transforms, permeating all existence. All things are crafted by its handiwork. All creatures benefit from its nourishing virtue, hence it is called the *"mother of all under heaven."* The term *"mother"* signifies its nurturing function.

**Meaning:**
Within the utmost void, wondrous Qi circulates, generating all things. Without the Dao, nothing could be born or completed. Since it gives life to all, it is the mother of all under heaven. Yet, though the Dao generates all forms and kinds, they all originate from it, transcending the boundaries of heaven and earth.

Now when we speak of *"the world"* (天下), we refer to its vastness. Yet the Dao’s generative transformation knows no limits—it gives rise to all things.

*The Zilin* states: *"It nurtures all things, hence it is called 'mother.'"*
I do not know its proper name, so I designate it as *"Dao"* (道), and by convention, I name it *"Great"* (大).

**Annotation:**
I have observed something generating and forming, yet it remains nameless and unknown. Thus, I use *"Dao"* to mark its generative virtue and *"Great"* to encompass its essence.

**Exposition:**
The term *"Dao"* marks its virtue, while the name *"Great"* defines its essence.
The *Laozi* speaks of the wondrous source generating and transforming, its applications boundless. In stillness and emptiness, it cannot be fixed in form. It precedes heaven and earth in existence, making its lineage impossible to trace. Hence, it is said: *"I do not know its name."*

Yet, seeing its boundless permeation of all things, I mark its generative virtue as *"Dao."* Thus, the Dao is the designation of its universal generation. The Dao’s pervasiveness knows no exclusion.

*The Xisheng Jing* says:
*"The Dao encompasses heaven and earth; even the finest autumn hair is within it."*
*Zhuangzi* states:
*"The Dao is in the ladder and the tiles, in all things—nowhere is it absent."*
Thus, whatever has form and life, the Dao resides within it. To lose the Dao is to perish.

**Exposition:**
Seeing its boundless embrace of all, I name it *"Great"* to signify its ultimate void. Normally, things are first named, then given a character; here, the Dao is first marked with a character, then named, descending from its origin.

**Meaning:**
Things have an essence, allowing them to contain others. Thus, the great contains the small, the outer holds the inner—this is the nature of things. Yet the Dao, though without essence, contains all things. Its essence is vast and boundless, hence it is named *"Great."* Greatness means it encompasses all, contains all—both the formed and the formless lie within its essence.

Normally, things are first named, then given a character. According to ritual, a boy on the third day of life is shot at with a willow bow and six millet arrows toward the four directions, symbolizing his duty to the world. At three months, his wife presents him to his father. Entering the gate, she ascends the east steps, then descends the west steps, while the father takes his right hand and names him, stroking his head. At twenty, he is crowned, marking his adulthood. He is crowned at the east steps, symbolizing succession. Seated at the guest position, he embodies the way of the mature. His crown is added to three times—first with plain cloth, then with leather, then with a ceremonial cap—showing increasing honor. The crowning and naming are acts of reverence.

Girls at fifteen are adorned, and their hair is pinned up, marking them with a character. Thus, the crowning ritual is the beginning of rites, the most solemn of ceremonies. This follows the pattern of first naming, then marking, as one grows from small to great.

Human relationships begin with an end, thus they grow from small to great, then return to completion. In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Huan of Lu, in his sixth year, ninth month, on the day *dingmao*, gave birth to a son. The duke asked Shen Xuan for a name. The minister replied: *"Names have five categories: those of truth, virtue, likeness, analogy, and resemblance. Naming a child after birth is truth, as with Tangshu Yu or Lu Gongzi You. Naming after virtue is virtue, as with King Wen’s Chang or King Wu’s Fa. Naming after likeness is likeness, as with Confucius resembling Mount Niuchou. Taking from things is analogy, as with Bo Yu’s birth—when someone gave fish, he was named Li (Carp). Taking from the father is resemblance, as with Zi Tong’s birth on the same day as his father."*

One does not name after a state, for that would abandon the name. One does not name after an office, for that would abandon duty. One does not name after mountains or rivers, for that would abandon the sovereign. One does not name after livestock, for that would abandon sacrifice. One does not name after broken vessels, for that would abandon ritual. One does not name after hidden illnesses, for such names are later tabooed. Thus, Jin abolished the position of *Situ* due to Duke Xi’s disgrace, Song abolished the *Sikong* due to Duke Wu’s misdeeds, and the former kings abolished the two mountains to teach the lesson.

The duke said: *"Since his birth coincides with mine, let us name him Tong (Same)."*

As for lineage, in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Yuan of Lu, in his eighth winter, the son of the duke, Wu Jue, died. His son, Yu Fu, requested a posthumous title and lineage. The duke asked Zhong Zhong. He replied: *"The Son of Heaven establishes virtue and, based on birth, grants a surname and allots land, thus bestowing a clan name. The feudal lords use their grandfather’s character or posthumous title as their clan name. If an official has hereditary merit, he takes his clan name from his ancestral office or domain. The same applies to domains."*

The duke then commanded that Yu Fu’s clan be named *Zhan*, for he was the grandson of Gongzi Zhan. The Dao, marked first with a character, then named, signifies its beginningless and endless nature. It demonstrates its function descending into traces, hence the character *"Dao."* Its mysterious essence is vast and distant, hence the name *"Great."* Without beginning or end, yet these names and characters are forcibly established.

The subtlety of the Great Dao is that its name and spoken words cannot be confined by a single path.

*"Great"* is called *"Passing"* (逝), *"Passing"* is called *"Distant"* (远), *"Distant"* is called *"Return"* (返).

**Commentary:** Its applications are boundless, yet names are forcibly imposed. Hence, when seeking from *"Great"*, it passes onward. When seeking from *"Passing"*, it is too distant to reach. If one truly comprehends, then *"Return"* lies within one’s own **mind-body** (身心) and is realized.

**Explication:** Those who are fixed in one direction are not the most universal of all under Heaven.

Thus, Heaven’s function generates but cannot manifestly contain, while Earth’s function contains but cannot generate. Only the mysterious essence of the Dao applies itself—its applications have no fixed direction. Though named *"Great"*, it does not remain confined by *"Great"*.

**Meaning:** The most universal under Heaven is the Dao. Fixed in one direction are Heaven and Earth.

Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, spring and summer, autumn and winter—all are what Heaven operates. Heaven’s **qi** (气) is vast and great, nurturing life universally, able to generate but not to contain, able to clarify but not to muddy, able to ascend but not to descend.

Earth’s **qi** spreads and pervades, bearing life broadly and thickly, able to contain but not to generate, able to muddy but not to clarify, able to descend but not to ascend.

The sun governs the day but cannot rule the night; the moon governs the night but cannot rule the day. Spring’s function is in birth but lacks the power of growth, nourishment, and storage. Summer’s function is in growth but lacks the ability to store and give rise. Autumn’s function is in completion but lacks the uses of birth, growth, and concealment. Winter’s function is in storage but lacks the effects of birth, growth, and austere killing. Wind’s function is in dispersion but cannot moisten; rain’s function is in moistening but cannot disperse.

If such things fixed in one direction are many, yet only the Great Dao can cover, contain, illuminate, and preside. It can generate, complete, and nourish; it can bring cold and heat, disperse and moisten. It can be yin and yang, soft and hard, present and ancient, round and square, clear and turbid, short and long. There is nothing it cannot do, nothing it cannot achieve—thus its applications have no fixed direction.

Though named *"Great"*, it is not bound by *"Great"*. This may be called the most universal under Heaven.

**Explication:** When seeking from *"Great"*, it passes onward. When seeking from *"Passing"*, it is too distant to reach. When seeking from *"Distant"*, it returns to the person’s **mind-body**—thus it is said *"Distant"* is *"Return"*.

Zhuangzi said: *"The Great Dao in the great does not end; in the minute does not neglect."* **Meaning:** Seeking from the great makes it ever greater, hence *"Passing"* onward. Seeking from *"Passing"* makes it ever more distant, hence *"Distant"* not reaching. Seeking from *"Distant"* does not depart from the self, hence *"Return"*.

Human rise and repose, movement and stillness, ascent and descent, bending and stretching—none depart from the Dao. How could the Dao be distant?

*"In the great does not end"* is from *Zhuangzi’s* **[□] *Tian Dao* (天道) Chapter**, where the Old Master (老君) tells Shicheng Qizi (士成绮): *"The Dao, in the great does not end, in the minute does not neglect—thus all things are complete."* Its breadth is such that it contains nothing; its depth is such that it cannot be measured.

**Virtue/power** (形德), **ren** (仁), and **yi** (义)—these are the Dao’s lesser aspects. Who but the most **ren** (至仁) could stabilize them?

This speaks of Heaven and Earth—the greatest of forms (形)—and autumnal hairs—the smallest of forms. The Dao that encompasses all things is even greater than Heaven and Earth; its greatness is boundless, hence *"does not end"*. The Dao that permeates the minutest things is present there, hence *"does not neglect"*. The Dao is everywhere—how could one measure it?

It is not confined by one direction; how could the four [Heaven, Earth, Sun, Moon] restrain it? Thus, the Dao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, and the King (王) is also great.

**Commentary:** Clarifying each according to what is great.

*"Obtaining One"* (得一) refers to Heaven, Earth, and the King. Heaven is great in its ability to cover; Earth is great in its ability to contain. The King is great in his ability to model Earth—when the King follows the Dao, Heaven moves in accordance with the Dao, hence *"also great"*.

**Explication:** Because the name *"Great"* is forcibly imposed, the next great things are Heaven, which can invert and conceal itself above, descending to cover all things; Earth, which can condense and remain still below, bearing all things thickly; and the King, who can maintain clarity and stillness, doing nothing yet transforming all surnames (姓).

These three great things—my Dao unifies them all.

**Meaning:** Heaven’s clarity accumulates **qi** above, embodying pure **yang** (阳), its motion ceaseless, its rigidity giving rise to refinement—thus it ranks beneath the Dao. Earth’s turbidity accumulates form below, embodying pure **yin** (阴), its stillness unchanging, its softness and submission bringing stability—thus it ranks beneath Heaven. The King’s rectitude governs the two **qi**s, presiding over all life, following the sequence of yin and yang, conforming to Heaven and Earth’s suitability, observing above and below, reverently considering ancient Dao. He clarifies to model Heaven, remains still to respond to Earth—thus his transformations are clear and still, his heart without action, and he aligns with the three great things.

These three great things are limited by one-directional **virtue/power** (德), lacking the ability to roundly penetrate and dynamically apply. Thus, my mysterious Dao unifies and transcends the three great things, becoming their master.

*"Obtaining One"* (得一) is from *The Analects*, where Zhongni (仲尼) tells Zeng Shen (曾参): *"Shen, my Dao is obtained by One."* **Pretense** (颠) means **apex** (顶); **playing with the distant** (玄) means **distant** (远).

Within the realm (域), there are four great things, and the King occupies one.

**Commentary:** The King is the master of all life (人灵), all things depending on his rise and fall. To emphasize his warning and instruction, it is said *"the King occupies one"*—meaning he should take this as a model, as in the following text.

**Explication:** *"Realm"* (域) is a **limited domain** (限域).

Now, the Dao within the limited domain is not confined there—if speaking of what is seen, then Heaven and Earth themselves form the limit, yet the Dao is not within the limit.

The ancient words preserve mysterious principles; it is not necessary to force strange meanings. The following text clarifies doubts and difficulties, yet many explanations remain incomplete.

**Meaning:** The limited domain’s limit itself contains many paths.

There are four great domains. The first is the **Realm of Vital Transformation** (生化之域), within the **internal realm of *qi*** (氣之内), the place where yin and yang nurture and shape it. The second is the **Realm of Marvelous Manifestation** (妙有之域), existing beyond the internal *qi*, in the realm of **Marvelous Non-Manifestation**. The third is the **Realm of Marvelous Non-Manifestation** (妙无之域), dwelling outside Marvelous Manifestation, where **primordial condensation** (捆缊始凝) begins to coalesce, yet is about to transform into Manifestation. The fourth is the **Realm beyond Marvelous Non-Manifestation**, called the **Dao-Domain** (道域), neither Manifestation nor Non-Manifestation, **boundless and limitless** (不穷不极).

Within these domains, it is said that the Dao transforms from **Non-Being to Being** (无生有), and through the differentiation of the **Two *Qi*** (二气), Heaven and Earth are born. Between Heaven and Earth, the myriad forms of all things are arrayed, and the **Sovereign** (君王) governs them. Just as the Dao is vast and encompasses Heaven and Earth, so too does the Sovereign arise after Heaven and Earth.

Thus, the names of the **Four Great Realms** (四大) are sequentially governed and contained—from Non-Being to Being, from Being back to Non-Being, in a **cyclic and eternal embrace**.

Moreover, the lower text states: *"Humans follow Earth, Earth follows Heaven, Heaven follows the Dao, and the Dao follows Nature"* (人法地，地法天，天法道，道法自然).

**Commentary:** Now, the term *"domain"* (域) refers to their names. Names are the **embodied realms** (体域); since no thing exists beyond its name, it is said *"within the domain"*. If one speaks of the Dao’s name, then the Dao is within it. If one speaks of Heaven’s name, then Heaven’s entirety is accounted for, hence the term *"within the domain"*—meaning that these four great realms are included **within the realm of named existence**.

Since the Sovereign holds one of them, he is the **primal essence of humanity** (人灵之首). If he follows the Dao, all things receive his **virtue/power** (德); if he does not, Heaven and Earth suffer his harm. Thus, it is specifically emphasized that *"the Sovereign occupies one"*—to urge him to naturally follow the Dao.

**Explication:** The **Sage’s decree** (圣旨) states that *"domain"* is the embodied realm of names, thus encompassing all meanings and being wondrous in its inclusivity. This is also akin to the Dao being the **named embodiment**, externally encompassing Heaven and Earth. Within Heaven and Earth, the Sovereign is paramount, and the meaning aligns accordingly.

When the Sovereign follows the Dao, the sun and moon shine like **jewel-embedded discs** (合璧), the five stars align like **pearls on a string** (连珠), sweet dew descends, and **honeyed springs** (醴泉) flow. The rivers neither overflow nor retreat, the seas neither surge nor recede. **Auspicious stars** (景星) appear, and **honorable clouds** (卿云) rise. The **divine dragon** (神龙) plays in the marshes, while the **unicorn and phoenix** (麟凤) come to his court. The **four seasons’ *qi*** (四气) harmonize to form the **Jade Candle** (玉烛), and all things flourish in their nature, achieving **Great Peace** (太平).

When the Sovereign lacks the Dao, then Heaven reverses its seasons, bringing **calamity** (灾); Earth reverses its bounty, producing **portents** (妖); humanity reverses its virtue, leading to **chaos** (乱). **Pestilential *qi*** (沴气) and **ominous signs** (咎征) appear above, while **monstrous forms** (物妖) and **unnatural shapes** (形怪) emerge below. Stars vanish, and **combatants’ banners** (日斗) rise; **winter thunder** (冬雷) and **summer frost** (夏霜) occur. The sky splits, and **stones rain** (石实); rivers dry up, and mountains crumble. Disasters arise among humans, and the *qi* responds in Heaven—thus, Heaven and Earth suffer his harm.

The Sovereign’s greatness determines the **safety and peril of Heaven and Earth** (天地之安危)—how can he not **embrace Nature** (抱自然) and follow Heaven, or **align with Non-Action** (任无为) and embody the Dao?

Humans follow Earth, Earth follows Heaven, Heaven follows the Dao, and the Dao follows Nature.
**Commentary:** Humans refers to the Sovereign. For the Sovereign, first he should follow Earth’s **tranquility** (安静), then emulate Heaven’s **cyclic transformation** (运用生成). Once transformation is achieved, he should follow the Dao’s **pure stillness and Non-Action** (清静无为), allowing things to **self-transform**. If the Sovereign can do this, he will **align with the Dao’s Natural Law** (合道法), embodying its essence.

**Commentary:** Humans refers to the Sovereign. Why call him "human"? Because humans can follow Heaven and Earth’s **transformative process** (生成) and the Dao’s **pure stillness** (清静), thereby making all under Heaven **turn toward him** (归往), which is why he is called Sovereign. If not, things have no direction, hence the warning *"humans"* to admonish him.

For the Sovereign, he must first follow Earth’s tranquility. Having achieved that, he must then follow Heaven’s **vital transformation** (生化), benefiting all things. He must also follow the Dao’s pure stillness and Non-Action, **forgetting his own deeds** (忘功於物) to let things self-transform. If the Sovereign can do this, he will align with the Dao’s Natural Law.

**Explication:** The Dao’s role is **transformative generation** (生成), Heaven’s is **encompassing protection** (包覆), and Earth’s is **bearing and nurturing** (厚载). The **patterns of Heaven and Earth** (乾坤之象) are manifest, and the **forms of all things** (品物之形) are arrayed. The Sovereign dwells among them, enacting the Dao’s transformation, conforming to Heaven’s **timing** (时), and following Earth’s **suitability** (宜). The people then **rest in tranquility** (安静) and **self-regulate** (自理), **transforming and flourishing** (生化) with **constancy** (有常), **remaining pure and unperturbed** (清静无扰), thus aligning with the **Great Dao’s Natural Law** (大道自然之理).

**Commentary:** It is said that the Dao **follows Natural Law** (法自然), not that it **mimics Natural Law** (仿法自然). If one claims, like the confused, that the Dao follows Natural Law by imitation, then there would be **five great realms** (五大) within the domain, not four. Again, citing the *"Western Ascension Scripture"* (《西升经》), it states: *"The Void generates Natural Law, and Natural Law generates the Dao"* (虚无生自然，自然生道). Thus, the Dao is the **grandson of the Void** (虚无之孙) and the **son of Natural Law** (自然之子). Such **fabricated precedence** (妄生先后之义) is used to establish **rank and hierarchy** (尊卑之目), blocking the **source and uprooting the roots** (塞源拔本), inverting the order—how profound the error!

**Explication:** The **doubtful and confused** (疑惑之人) do not grasp the **principles of the scriptures** (经理), and thus claim that the Great Dao follows Natural Law by imitation, as though Natural Law resides above the Dao. Then there would be **five great realms within the domain**, including Natural Law. Again, calling the Dao the **son of Natural Law** (自然之子) and the **grandson of Non-Action** (无为之孙) are all **erroneous perceptions** (妄见), hence the need for the following text to clarify.

**Blocking the source and uprooting the roots** (塞源拔本) refers to the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, **Zhao Gong Year Nine** (昭公九年), where **Jin’s Liang Bing and Zhang Di** (晋梁丙、张趯) led the **Yin tribes** (阴戎) to attack **Ying** (颖). This was due to **Zhou’s Gan Ren** (周甘人) and **Jin’s Yan Jia** (晋阎嘉) disputing over **Yan Field** (阎田).

**Zhao King** (周景王) sent the **Great Officer Yan Huan Bo** (大夫詹桓伯) to remonstrate with Jin:

*"Since the time of Xia, we have had Ji, Wei, Dai, Rui, Qi, and Bi—these are our western lands. Ba, Pu, Chu, and Deng—these are our southern lands. When King Wu overthrew Shang, we gained Pu Gu and Shang Yan—these are our eastern lands. Su Shen and Yan, Bo—these are our northern lands. Why should we have any closer **feudal grants** (封)?"

*"The founders Wen and Wu, along with King Cheng and King Kang, established their brothers as **feudatories** (母弟) to **defend the borders** (藩屏) of Zhou. Even so, their **decline and fall** (废坠) is due to their own faults—how can it be attributed to the **hat and headband** (弁髦) and thus blame the **outer garments** (敝)?"*

*"The former kings stationed the **mythical beast Tiangao** (梼杌) at the four frontiers to **ward off malevolent spirits** (御魑魅). Thus, when the **Fiend Yuan** (允姓) of **Gua State** (瓜州) plotted treachery, his **uncle Hui Gong** (伯父惠公) returned from Qin, **luring him to come** (诱之以来), causing him to **oppress our noble clans** (偪我诸姬) and **invade our borderlands** (入我郊甸), then the tribes **seized him** (则戎焉取之).*

The **barbarians** hold the Central States—who shall answer for this?

When **Hou Ji** cultivated the land and multiplied the people across the world, now the **barbarians** dominate them—is this not difficult?

**Uncle Hui Gong**, devise a plan.

My presence with **Uncle Hui Gong** is like the **crown and cap** to the **garments**, the **roots and source** to water and wood, and the **strategist** to the people. If **Uncle Hui Gong** were to **tear the crown, destroy the cap**, **uproot the source, and block the flow**, and **abandon the strategist**, even the **barbarians and Di tribes**, what more could they take from a single man?

**Shu Xiang** said to **Xuan Zi**:
*"Was **Wen**’s hegemony able to alter the course of things? He **supported the Son of Heaven** and added **reverence** to it. Since **Wen**, successive generations have declined in **virtue**, yet they **oppressed and disregarded the Zhou lineage**, flaunting their excess. Is it not fitting that the **feudatories** turn against them?

Moreover, the **King’s words** are sincere—**Uncle Hui Gong**, you must devise a plan."

**Xuan Zi** was pleased.

When the **King** suffered a **bereavement among his relatives**, he sent **Zhao Cheng** to **Zhou to offer condolences**, and also to present **Yan Tian** and **Shu**, and to return **the captive of Jing**. The **King** also sent **Bin Hua** to hold **Gan Daifu Shang** and persuade him in **Jin**, and the people of **Jin** honored him and sent him back.

**Citation**:
Moreover, let us examine this theory:
**"The Void"** is the **substance of the Mysterious Origin**.
Its **substance** is not a material thing, hence it is called **"the Void"**.
**"Spontaneity"** is the **nature of the Mysterious Origin**.
Its **nature** is not contrived, hence it is called **"Spontaneity"**.
**"The Dao"** is the **function of the Mysterious Origin**—a **strongly named** principle that encompasses all generation, hence it is called **"the Dao"**.
Condensing **substance, nature, and function** into a name, it is called **"the Void, Spontaneity, and Dao"**—thus, it is the **One Mysterious Origin**, and what need is there for imitation?

Then one knows the difficulty of those who are **bewildered**—they have not reached the **Key to the Profound**.

**Explanation**:
*"Key"* means **"pivotal point."**
This clarifies that the **Great Dao** has **"the Void"** as its **substance**, **"Spontaneity"** as its **nature**, and **"the Dao"** as its **wondrous function**. When spoken of separately, it is **one as three**; when unified, it is **three as one**.
Generally, it is called **"the Void, Spontaneity, and Great Dao"**—all converging into **one essence**, not a sequence where one generates another or follows a pattern of superiority and inferiority.

Without **Spontaneity**, one cannot illuminate the **nature of the Dao**; without **the Void**, one cannot illuminate the **substance of the Dao**; without **universal generation**, one cannot illuminate the **function of the Dao**.
To thoroughly examine this **wondrous principle** is to attain the **Key to the Profound**.

**Attributed to Master Guangcheng of Tang, Du Guangting (唐广成先生杜光庭述)**.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: "The Heavy as the Root of the Light"**

**Explication:**

The preceding chapter spoke of the vastness within the domain, ultimately allowing the Dao to unfold naturally. This chapter elucidates the **heavy as sovereign over the light**, warning against the frivolity of the world. The first two lines establish the principle to show its meaning; the next two offer analogies to clarify further. Four lines lament the ruler’s deviation from the Dao, and the final two serve as a caution against lightness and haste.

**Meaning:**
Earlier, the ruler was taken as the model—embodying the Dao and conforming to Heaven. Now, the text demonstrates the virtue of **heaviness and stillness**, warning against lightness and agitation, to illustrate the benefits of **heaviness and stillness**. Analogies are given to reinforce the argument, and the harms of lightness and agitation are recounted, concluding with a profound admonition.

Indeed, the **Perfect Sage** cultivates the Dao, and the **enlightened ruler** governs with reverence—both must prioritize **heaviness and solemnity**, establishing **stillness as the foundation**. To govern with **heaviness and stillness** brings harmony to the people and the spread of virtue. To preserve oneself with **heaviness and stillness** opens the Dao and ensures tranquility of spirit. But if one clings to triviality and acts with agitation, the ruler’s lightness and haste leave the people without guidance, while a restless mind fails to safeguard the spirit.

When the spirit scatters, the body perishes; when the people disperse, the state is endangered. This is a profound warning indeed.

**The heavy is the root of the light; stillness is the sovereign of agitation.**
**Annotation:** The heavy restrains the light, hence it is the root; stillness governs agitation, hence it is the sovereign.

**Explication:**
*Root* means *foundation*—just as the roots of plants are heavy while leaves and flowers are light, and the leaves and flowers depend on the roots for growth, the roots are the foundation of the leaves and flowers. Thus, it is said: *The heavy is the root of the light.*

Since the heavy brings stillness and the light brings agitation, if the heavy is the root of the light, then stillness is the sovereign of agitation. Thus, it is known that the heavy has the power to restrain the light, and stillness has the strength to govern agitation. Therefore, when authority is heavy, the affairs of the nose (i.e., governance) are successfully managed; when the mind is still, the desires of the jaws (i.e., gluttony) naturally cease.

**Meaning:**
The heavy is **tranquil and aligned with the Dao**; the agitated is **frivolous and loses its authenticity**. The analogy is that flowers and leaves are light, while roots are heavy—light things are easily damaged, while heavy things are hard to harm. This is like conduct: if a state governs with **heaviness and stillness**, the people are at ease; if a person preserves themselves with **heaviness and stillness**, their spirit is serene.

Thus, when disorder threatens the state, **virtue is accumulated to stabilize it**; when agitation disturbs the mind, **harmony is cultivated to restrain it**. This is to embody the principle of restraining the light and governing agitation, avoiding the censure of gluttonous desires.

Hence, **Du Bo of Zhou** was entrusted with governance due to his solemn weight, while **Zhuang of En** was abandoned because of his hasty urgency. This is a clear warning for rulers and ministers alike.

**Annotation on *朵颐* (Duo yí):**
This term comes from the *Yijing*’s *Yi* hexagram, *Initial Nine*: *"The jaws move—beginning with movement, unable to nourish others by relying on oneself, instead moving to seek nourishment. This is agitation that harms oneself, hence perilous."* *Yi* means *nourishment*—the jaws are the pivot of the mouth, hence *"the pivot moves, determining honor and disgrace."* How can this not be a warning?

Thus, the **Perfect Sage** moves through the day without straying from their **carriage and baggage.**
**Annotation:** *Carriage* refers to the vehicle; *baggage* refers to the heavy loads carried. Those who value **heaviness and stillness** must also guard against lightness and agitation, just as travelers must not abandon their **carriage and baggage**. To lose them means suffering cold and hunger; to indulge in lightness and agitation brings misfortune and chaos.

**Explication:**
The **Perfect Sage** refers to the ruler—one whose virtue can govern people and things, hence the term *Sage*. *Carriage* means *screened vehicle*; *baggage* refers to the heavy loads. This is an analogy: the ruler must always uphold **heaviness and stillness**, just as a traveler must never part from their **carriage and baggage**. If a traveler loses their loads, they will lack sustenance and face cold and hunger. If a ruler indulges in lightness and agitation, their subjects will scatter, and calamity will follow. Hence, *"throughout the day, one does not depart from their carriage and baggage."*

**Meaning:**
When the ruler embodies **heaviness and stillness**, governance becomes effortless and effective, desires diminish yet abundance remains, kindness is extended without action, trust is earned without words, gains are achieved without seeking, and success is attained without striving. Embracing **spontaneity** and **primordial simplicity**, the realm thrives in peace.

When a person cultivates **heaviness and stillness**, harmonious *qi* accumulates in the mind, thoughts remain balanced, perception remains clear, external distractions fail to confuse, and internal desires do not disturb—thus, longevity is ensured.

Even amidst splendor and grandeur, they dwell in serene detachment.
**Annotation:** Though the ruler may enjoy **honor and spectacle**, they must reside in tranquility and distance themselves from worldly concerns.

**Explication:**
If a ruler indulges in **heaviness and stillness**, the people are not burdened. But if they construct lofty towers and deep pools, ring bells, and dance with attendants—pursuing **honor and spectacle**—they exhaust the people’s strength, and ruin follows. Hence the warning: though there may be **honor and spectacle**, one must dwell in ease and detachment, far removed from such distractions.

**Meaning:**
**Honor and spectacle** are signs of opulence. If a ruler adorns their senses with extravagance, exhausts the people with decadence, and indulges in alluring beauty to dissipate their resolve, the state will perish and the ruler will be disgraced—before long.

Though there may be **honor and spectacle**, how can they bring true joy? *Yan* means *ease*; *chāo* means *distant*. Even if **honor and spectacle** abound, they should be disregarded and not allowed to unsettle the mind.

The lofty towers and deep pools—according to the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, in the winter of the twentieth year of Duke Zhao’s reign, Duke Jing of Qi suffered from a severe skin ailment, which worsened and did not heal within the prescribed time. Many guests from the feudal lords came to inquire after his health.

The ministers Liangqiu Ju and Yi Kuang spoke to the duke, saying: *"We have served the spirits and deities with great abundance, surpassing what our ancestors did. Now that Your Grace is ill and the feudal lords are concerned, this is the fault of the diviner and historian. The feudal lords are unaware, but they may think we do not revere the spirits. Why not execute the diviner Zhu Gu and the historian Shi Hao to appease the guests?"*

The duke was pleased and told Yan Zi of this. Yan Zi replied: *"At the alliance of Song, Qu Jian asked Zhao Wu about the virtue of Fan Hui. Zhao Wu said: 'The master’s household affairs were well-ordered; when speaking in the state of Jin, he exhausted his sincerity without favor. His diviner and historian performed their rites with reverence. Chen Xin had no shame. His household affairs were without deceit, and his diviners and historians did not pray for selfish gain. Qu Jian reported this to King Kang, who said: 'The spirits and sages have no grievance; it is fitting that the master should shine as the auxiliary of five lords and be made king of the feudal lords.'"* #2 *Five lords* refers to Wen, Sheng, Ling, Cheng, and Jing.

The duke said: *"Ju and Kuang claim that I am diligent in serving the spirits and deities, so they wish to execute the diviners and historians. You praise their words—why?"*

Yan Zi replied: *"For a virtuous ruler, both inner and outer affairs are in order, and there is no resentment between superiors and inferiors. All actions align with propriety, and their diviners and historians offer sincere prayers without shame. Thus, the spirits and deities are pleased, the state receives blessings, and the diviners and historians share in this fortune. Their role is to extend blessings and longevity, acting as the ruler’s faithful messengers in their devotion to the spirits and deities.

But if the ruler is licentious, with inner and outer affairs awry, resentment among superiors and inferiors, and actions contrary to propriety, indulging in lust and private desires, constructing lofty towers and deep pools, striking bells, and dancing with attendants—exhausting the people’s strength, plundering their wealth, and disregarding future generations—then their cruelty and excess are unchecked. They fear no censure, heed no warnings, and scorn the spirits and deities. The spirits grow angry, the people suffer, and there is no repentance in their hearts. When their diviners and historians offer prayers, it is an admission of guilt. Their rituals are flawed and deceitful, and in their advancement and retreat, they resort to empty flattery to curry favor. Thus, the spirits and deities bring calamity upon the state, and the diviners and historians share in this ruin. Their role is to serve as the violent ruler’s agents, speaking arrogantly and insolently to the spirits and deities."*

The duke asked: *"Then what should be done?"*

Yan Zi replied: *"It cannot be done this way: the forests’ timber is guarded by the rangers; the marsh’s birds and reeds are guarded by the boatmen; the groves’ firewood is guarded by the foresters;"*

「The seas’ salt and *shèn* (海蜃, *shèn* being a kind of large sea snail or mythical creature), let the *qíwàng* (祈望) officers guard them. The common folk of the counties and villages, enter to serve his governance; the *fújiè* (福介) pass gates, demand private tribute; the hereditary officials, seize their bribes with force.

In the markets, there are no skilled artisans; in taxation, there is no limit. His palaces are constantly rebuilt, and his licentious pleasures are never restrained. Concubines of his inner favor, plunder freely in the markets; ministers of his outer favor, arrogantly issue commands in the villages. When his private desires are not satisfied, he grows resentful. If the people suffer as if ill, husbands and wives alike curse him.

Though curses may harm, blessings cannot undo the wrath of countless millions. If the ruler wishes to punish the diviners and historians, he must first cultivate his virtue.

The duke rejoiced and commanded his officials to ease the governance, destroy the pass gates, remove the prohibitions, lighten the taxes, and cease the punishments. In the twelfth month, Duke Jing went hunting at Pèi.

This shows how Yan Zi’s words were beneficial, and how Duke Jing followed his advice, cultivated his virtue, and saw his illness swiftly heal—so much so that he could resume hunting.

Alas, how can a sovereign of *wànshèng* (万乘, a ruler commanding ten thousand chariots) risk his own life so lightly against the will of the people? *注*: *Nàihé* (奈何) is a word of lament; *tiānxià* (天下) refers to the supreme position of authority.

It speaks of how a ruler laments his own folly in yielding to desire, thus endangering his life and imperiling his supreme position.

*疏*: The Son of Heaven (天子) holds lands of ten thousand *fēng* (封, a unit of land), levies taxes from six hundred and forty thousand *wànpíng* (万井, households under the井田 system), and commands a million *shèng* (乘, chariots) of warhorses and ten thousand chariots of troops. Thus, he is called the sovereign of *wànshèng* (万乘).

*Nàihé* (奈何) is a word of lament; *tiānxià* (天下) refers to the supreme position of authority.

A sovereign of *wànshèng* (万乘) must rule over all four seas, ensuring his descendants endure for countless generations and his lineage flourishes for a hundred ages. If he governs well, he will achieve effortless transformation; if he holds fast, he will cut off the unvirtuous and return to the Way of Ren (仁).

Water cannot bear such a heavy responsibility—if he indulges in pleasures and risks his life to fulfill desires, he will surely be destroyed. Thus, a single ruler’s recklessness imperils the supreme position of authority, which is truly lamentable.

Hence it is said: *Nàihé* (奈何).

In terms of meaning: The Son of Heaven, as the father of Heaven and mother of Earth, proclaims his kinship with the Supreme Deity (上帝), inheriting the mandate of the Highest Heaven (昊天), and is thus called the Son of Heaven. It is also said that he follows Heaven’s patterns and the Way’s principles, nurturing all people, and is thus called the Son of Heaven.

*Tífēng* (提封) refers to the lands within the four boundaries. *Wànpíng* (万井) is the井田 system. A *píng* (井) is a square of land with a *li* (里) on each side, and a hundred thousand *píng* (井) would thus encompass ten thousand *li* (里).

The Son of Heaven commands a million *shèng* (乘) of warhorses and ten thousand chariots of troops, with vast levies and tributes, making him rich beyond the four seas—hence the term *wànshèng* (万乘) sovereign.

The Grand Marshal of Qi, Tian Rangqu, established military laws, including the chariot levy. His system began with infantry: lifting one foot is called a *kuǐ* (跬, three feet), and two feet is called a *bù* (步, six feet). A hundred *bù* (步) make a *mǔ* (亩, a unit of land), meaning the plot is six feet wide and a hundred feet long, totaling six hundred square feet. *Mǔ* (亩) means "mother," for it is broad enough to plant seedlings and crops, fulfilling the nurturing function of a mother.

A hundred *mǔ* (亩) make a *fū* (夫, a farmer’s plot), with the farmer tending it. As *The Rituals of the Ruler* (《王制》) states: "The upper-ranked farmer is allotted a hundred *mǔ* (亩) of land." Three *fū* (夫) plots form a *wū* (屋, a household unit), and together, they measure a hundred feet long and three hundred feet wide, making a *wū* (屋) the space for a single family, including husband, wife, and brothers, totaling three hundred *mǔ* (亩).

Three *wū* (屋) form a *jǐng* (井, a井田 cluster). One *wū* (屋) is a hundred feet long and a *lǐ* (里) wide, so three *wū* (屋) together cover an area of one *lǐ* (里). The name *jǐng* (井) comes from the fact that the spaces between *fū* (夫) plots are channels (*suì* 遂), allowing water to flow freely in all directions, forming a井 (well) shape.

Why? Because a *mǔ* (亩) is six feet wide and a hundred feet long, plowed with a *sì* (耜, a hoe). The *sì* (耜) is five inches wide, and two *sì* (耜) form a *ǒu* (耦, a pair), one foot wide. The plowing follows the length of the *ǒu* (耦), which is a hundred feet long, with ridges (*lěng* 畎) to allow water drainage. The water flows through the ridges, hence the name *lěng* (畎).

The farmer’s field, extending from the plot’s head, doubles in width and depth, becoming a *suì* (遂, channel). Nine *fū* (夫) plots form a *jǐng* (井), and the spaces between them, four feet wide and deep, are called *gōu* (沟, ditches), taking their name from the *suì* (遂) channels that connect them like a井 (well) shape. Thus, it is called *jǐngtián* (井田, well-field system).

Ten *jǐng* (井) form a *tōng* (通, a larger administrative unit), covering an area of one *lǐ* (里) in length and ten *lǐ* (里) in width. Thirty such *tōng* (通) units, each ten *lǐ* (里) wide and long, share one *shì* (士, scholar-officer) and two *tú* (徒, laborers).

Ten *tōng* (通) units form a *chéng* (城, walled city), each ten *lǐ* (里) in length and width. It is said that one chariot levy (*shèng* 乘) is completed when a city is formed. A walled city contributes one chariot (*yúchéng* 车一乘), ten *shì* (士), and twenty *tú* (徒).

A thousand-chariot state would thus have a thousand such cities, contributing ten thousand *shì* (士) and twenty thousand *tú* (徒). A *wànshèng* (万乘) state would have ten thousand such cities, providing ten thousand chariots, a hundred thousand *shì* (士), and two hundred thousand *tú* (徒). This is the system of the Grand Marshal’s laws.

*The Rituals of the Ruler* (《王制》) states: "A single walled city of nine hundred thousand *qǐng* (顷, a unit of land) yields one chariot, three armored soldiers (*jiǎshì* 甲士), and seventy-two foot soldiers (*bùzú* 步卒)." For a *wànshèng* (万乘) state, this would mean three hundred thousand armored soldiers and seventy-two hundred thousand foot soldiers.

*The Rituals of the Ruler* and *The Grand Marshal’s Laws* differ, so both are preserved here.

The supreme position of authority (*dàbǎo zhī wèi* 大宝之位) is as *The Book of Changes, [Xì] System* (《易□系》) states: "The supreme treasure of the sage is called *wèi* (位, position)." It speaks of how the supreme position can be cherished, for it is the authority over all under Heaven. *Wèi* (位) is a place of great utility, and *bǎo* (宝) is a thing of great utility. One who holds this supreme position must wield boundless authority, hence it is called the supreme treasure.

Why does guarding the position rely on *rén* (仁)? Because one who holds this supreme treasure must preserve it with benevolence as his heart, morality as his foundation, reverence for tranquility as his practice, and frugality as his principle. Thus, he unifies the four seas under a single script, and all lands pay tribute. His descendants, like the branches of Heaven and leaves of Earth, endure forever.

If he upholds virtue in its roots and foundations, and guards purity in his embrace, then he will govern well.»

「Thus, if a ruler’s benevolence is so admired that all under Heaven flock to him, he must not indulge in excessive delight in hunting or feasting, nor neglect his duties while chasing fleeting pleasures, nor drain the people’s strength to sustain his own body, nor provoke the resentment of the world to satisfy his desires—lest his fortune be exhausted and his lineage extinguished, with the people turning against him and his kin, causing him to lose all of Heaven’s grandeur through his own solitary downfall. Such was the fate of the Xia ruler *Jǐ* (癸), the Yin ruler *Xīn* (辛), the Zhou ruler *Yǎn* (赧), and the Han ruler *Xiàn* (献), all of whom, though crowned with the might of ten thousand chariots, perished at the hands of common men.

Hence, the lament arises: *“Alas, how tragic!”*

When a ruler is **light** (轻), he loses his ministers; when a minister is **hasty** (躁), he loses his lord.

**Annotation:**
*A lord who acts with lightness and ease will surely bring turmoil, and turmoil will scatter his people—who then would remain as his ministers?*
Thus, it is said: **Lightness leads to the loss of ministers.** This is a warning to the lord.

**Explication:**
The lord who harbors **lightness** in his conduct, who does not cultivate inner tranquility, may either indulge in reckless hunting, or tirelessly roam the lands, or issue decrees in the morning and reverse them by evening, or alter laws and customs without measure. When his affairs multiply, governance becomes burdensome; when governance is burdensome, the people grow weary; when the people are weary, arms rise in rebellion, households flee, and the populace scatters. This is what is meant by **losing his ministers.**

Consider, for instance, the Xia ruler *Yuè* (后洛) who hunted in the *Bó* (泊) marshes for ten weeks without returning; or the Sui ruler *Yáng* (炀) whose campaign in *Liáo Dōng* (辽东) resulted in a hundred thousand men lost to ruin. These are the very examples.

**Annotation:**
*A minister must measure his abilities before accepting office, lest he incur slander by rushing for advancement.*
If he falsifies his path to seek favor, or feigns deceit to gain honor, and his **hastiness** in seeking is thus extreme, then disaster will soon follow, and he will be **banished or slain** for his treachery. How then can he serve his lord?

Thus, it is said: **Hastiness leads to the loss of one’s lord.** This is a stern admonition to ministers.

**Explication:**
*Slander* (谤) means *calumny* (诽). *Seeking* (干) means *to pursue* (求). *Deceit* (诈) means *to mislead* (诳). *Banished* (窜) means *to flee* (逃). *Slain* (殛) means *to kill* (杀). *Stern* (申) means *to emphasize* (重).

When a minister is greedy for honor and **hasty** in his ambition, he disrupts the established order of the state. In the worst case, he faces **execution or slaughter**; in the lesser case, **banishment or exile**. This is not Heaven’s punishment for his crimes, but his own self-destruction—how much more so for one who professes the Dao/Way yet harbors **lightness and hastiness** in his deeds? Such a man cannot even hope to glimpse the essence of **serene harmony and emptiness** (恬和虚寂).

The **stern warning** (申) is given: the cases of the **banishment of the Sān Miáo** (三苗) and the **slaughter of Gǔn** (鲧) serve as precedent.

Thus concludes the *Broad Saintly Meanings of the Dao/Way and Virtue* (道德真经广圣义) scroll, the twenty-second in its series.»

「#1 *Zhùshǐ* (祝史) and *sacrifice* (祭祝): *"Sacrifice"* (祭祝) should be read as *"sacrifice and divination"* (祭祀), according to the *Zuǒ Zhuan* (左传).

#2 *"For all the feudal lords"* (诸侯王): According to the *Zuǒ Zhuan* (左传), *"lord"* (王) should be read as *"ruler"* (主).

#3 *"Market lacks skill"* (市当无艺): According to the *Zuǒ Zhuan* (左传), *"market regulations"* (市当) should be read as *"common practices"* (布常).

Thus concludes the *Broad Saintly Meanings of the Dao/Way and Virtue* (道德真经广圣义) scroll, the twenty-third in its series.

**Táng Guāngchéng xiānsheng** (唐广成先生) **Dù Guāngtíng** (杜光庭) expounds:

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: *The Footprints of Virtuous Conduct* (善行无辙迹)**

**Commentary:** The previous chapter emphasized *serene stillness* (重静) as the ruler’s path, urging sincerity in conduct and lightness in governing the world. This chapter clarifies that *virtuous conduct lacks obstruction*, encouraging constant benevolence to save others, upholding *serene stillness*, and ruling the state through *effortless virtue* (无为善行). It stresses the value of *forgetting and letting go* (忘遗).

It begins by marking the Five Virtuous Conducts (五善之行), then elucidates the benevolent principle of *saving others* (善救), and the training of *virtuous individuals* (善人) to be open-hearted and forgetful. Though it seems to conclude with the highest mysteries, its intent remains clear.

**Meaning:** The previous warning against *lightness and hastiness* (轻躁) was a rule for ministers and rulers to maintain their proper stations. This section marks the Five Virtuous Conducts (五善之文), illustrating the practice of *cultivating the Dao* (修道) and *attaining the True* (参真).

As for *saving others and things* (救人救物), it demonstrates the *boundless compassion* (无弃之慈) as both teacher and resource, and further expounds the principle that *virtue and conduct interdependently support each other* (畅相须之旨), reinforcing the essential mysteries and warning those who remain long misguided.

**Virtuous conduct leaves no footprints** (善行无辙迹):
**Note:** Within all *dharma* (法), one who *penetrates the true nature* (体了真性) and *acts without clinging to form* (行无行相) is thus called *virtuous conduct*.

When one’s heart aligns with the Dao (道), no footprints can be traced—this is the *mystery of the Way* (无辙迹可寻求).

**Commentary:** This illustrates the *pure nature of dharma* (法性清净) and *practice* (修行). The pure nature of dharma, when cultivated, is called *Supreme Mystery* (重玄). Though one relies on diligent practice, it must be without attachment. As each stage arises, it must be extinguished; thus, conduct lacks form, and the heart unites with the Dao, making it *virtuous conduct*.

To seek such footprints is difficult—when one’s heart is still and the external *scenes* (境) are forgotten, both *mind* (空) and *scenes* (有) are unified in purity. To search for footprints here is impossible.

Thus it is said: *Virtuous conduct leaves no footprints*.

**Meaning:** The pure nature of dharma inherently aligns with the Dao. The Dao emanates from *Primordial Qi* (元气) and manifests in humanity; the *numinous repositories* (灵府) and *innate wisdom* (智性) are originally pure. After birth, however, *defilements* (染欲) and *corruptions* (渎乱) obscure the true nature, causing one to drift farther from the Dao.

Those who cultivate virtue *close the Six Desires* (六欲), *settle the Five Emotions* (五情), *remove all perceptual attachments* (诸见法), and *extinguish all forms* (诸有相), emptying the *numinous platform* (灵台) within to seek the true nature, returning to their original purity—then they attain purity.

Though this follows the *Three Vehicles* (三乘) of teaching, those who cultivate practice *without dwelling in dharma* (於法不住) and *without clinging to form* (行相之中，亦不滞着) extinguish defilements and transcend the duality of *emptiness* (空) and *existence* (有), achieving unity in purity—thus, no traces of the heart can be found.

Within, it is called *heart* (心); when the heart is still, externally it is called *scenes* (境), and these too are forgotten. Hence, the heart is still, the scenes are forgotten—both paths are unobstructed.

Having awakened within the heart, one does not need to seek afar. No *tracks of chariots* (车辙) appear beyond the four quarters.

The *Sage-Emperor* (帝王) governs with the pure Dao, achieving *Great Unity* (混然大同), where all nations follow in harmony. He does not need to spread *chariot tracks* (车辙) or *horse prints* (马迹) across the land—this is called *mastering oneself and the state* (理身与国), both attaining the mystery of *virtuous conduct*.

**Virtuous speech lacks flaws or censure** (善言无瑕谪):
**Note:** One who *penetrates the teachings of speech* (了言教), *does not cling to obstruction*, and *discards images to grasp meaning* (遗象求意) is trained to *forget speech* (言忘). Thus, within virtuous speech, there are no flaws or censure.

**Commentary:** This illustrates that one who practices *virtuous conduct* does not cling to the teachings of speech. *Flaw* (瑕) means *defect* (病); *censure* (谪) means *blame* (责). *Speech* refers to *teachings of speech* (言教).

If *virtuous conduct leaves no footprints*, one can *penetrate the teachings of speech* without clinging, *forgetting speech* within speech—this is *virtuous speech*. Such a person *discards images to preserve meaning* (遗象存意), *understands and forgets speech* (理照言忘), and thus finds no defects or blame in those teachings.

Thus it is said: *Virtuous speech lacks flaws or censure*.

**Meaning:** *Defect* (疵) means *illness* (病). The *Sage* (圣人) knows that *teaching others* (代人) cannot lack speech, so establishes speech to clarify teachings and uses teachings to guide people. The common folk, however, *cling to teachings and are obstructed by speech*, thus incurring *defects* and *blame*.

Those who do not grasp the principle (理) or reach the Dao are ever farther from it as speech increases.

Those who cultivate virtue *grasp teachings through speech* (因言而悟教), *understand principles through teachings* (因教而达理), *seek principles to align with the Dao* (寻理而契道), and *align with the Dao to forget speech* (契道而忘言)—thus, they lack defects or blame.

*The *Yì Jiě Lì* (易略例) states:* Speech arises from *symbols* (象), so one may seek speech to observe symbols. Symbols arise from *meaning* (意), so one may seek symbols to observe meaning. Meaning is exhausted by symbols, symbols are fixed by speech, hence one attains meaning and forgets symbols, attains symbols and forgets speech.

Those who retain speech have not grasped symbols; those who retain symbols have not grasped meaning. Symbols arise from meaning yet are retained as symbols—what is retained is not the true meaning. Speech arises from symbols yet is retained as speech—what is retained is not the true speech.

Symbols are *resemblances* (似). The principles expounded exceed what speech can convey or the mind can conceive—this is no different from the true essence of *forgetting speech and severing thought* (忘言绝虑). Thus, symbols are *resemblances*.

It is like gazing at one’s reflection in a mirror: the reflection is not the *substance* (骨肉之身) of the body. If one clings to the reflection as the body, one loses the true reflection. If one does not rely on the reflection, one cannot recognize the true body.

The *mirror* (镜) is a metaphor for *speech*; the *reflection* (影) is a metaphor for *symbols*; the *body* (身) is a metaphor for *meaning*. One who attains meaning through speech merely *harmonizes with the true heart* (冥契真心).

There are three aspects of dharma: *speech* (言), *symbols* (象), and *meaning* (意). Speech is the *metaphor* (能诠), meaning is the *principle expounded* (所诠), symbols are the *medium* (通所能)—thus, one discards symbols to preserve meaning, grasps principles to forget speech.

Those who attain this have no defects or blame.

**Virtuous calculation does not rely on reckoning tools** (善计不用筹算):
**Note:** One who *penetrates all dharma* (了诸法) inherently has no *duality of gates* (二门), for *one thread unifies all* (一以贯之), generating no other views. Thus, no need for *reckoning tools* (筹算)—one naturally discerns, and *calculation lacks form* (计无计相), what else could this be but *virtue*?」

「Commentary: This elucidates that when *speech-teaching* (言教) is without obstruction, then there is no calculation of divergent gates. To grasp *speech* and grasp *action*, to distinguish *truth* from *falsehood*—these clever artifices (巧历) cannot even suffice for calculation.

If one *penetrates all dharma* (了诸法), all paths are *skillful gates* (方便门), culminating in pristine purity (究竟清净), generating no other views (不生他见), then there is no need for reckoning tools (筹策算数)—one naturally attains the *single vehicle* (一乘). *Virtuous calculation* (善计) such as this, why would it need reckoning tools? Hence it is said: *Virtuous calculation does not rely on reckoning tools*.

The meaning is: *reckoning rods* (筹), *calculation* (计), and *strategies* (策) are all forms of reckoning (算). The *reckoning rod* is long by a *shǐ* (尺) with a *wò* (握)—the *wò* is the root of the rod, where the hand holds it. Beyond the *wò*, it extends a *shǐ*.

In games like *casting the gourd* (投壶) and *archery* (射), reckoning rods are used to record victory and defeat (胜负), hence the *Book of Rites* (礼记) states: "Many reckoning rods, few drinks" (多算饮少算). The *Rites of Casting the Gourd* (投壶礼) say: When the left and right announce the arrows are ready, the *archery overseer* (司射) sits and releases one reckoning rod. After completion, the overseer holds the rods and counts: two rods for *even* (纯), one rod for *odd* (奇). Then, with the odd rod, he announces: "So-and-so excels over so-and-so." Whether one wins or ties, the victor drinks, the non-victor does not. Thus, it is known that all reckoning and measuring rely on rods to determine their excess or deficiency.

Hence, the art of reckoning (算学) originated with the ministers and officials of the Yellow Emperor (黄帝), who first applied arithmetic to calculations. Numbers (数) arise from the *Dao/Way* (道). The *Spring and Autumn Annals* (春秋) state: *The Dao/Way* generates and gives rise to *qi* (气), *qi* generates and then gives rise to *vital nourishment* (滋), *vital nourishment* generates and then gives rise to *forms* (象), *forms* generate and then give rise to *numbers* (数). From this, the art of reckoning flourishes.

To comprehend the *measures of Heaven and Earth* (天地之度), to discern the *categories of things* (品物之数), to examine the *transformations of yin and yang* (阴阳之变), to fathom the *origins of music and calendar* (律历之元)—all these require reckoning to determine their excess or deficiency. Thus, the general principles of reckoning include *numbers* and *measures*, *quantities* and *weights*.

Numbers begin from *one* to *ten*, *ten* to *hundred*, *thousand* to *ten thousand*, *ten thousand* to *hundred million*, *hundred million* to *trillion*, *trillion* to *quadrillion*, *quadrillion* to *quintillion*, *quintillion* to *sextillion*, *sextillion* to *septillion*, *septillion* to *octillion*, *octillion* to *nonillion*, *nonillion* to *decillion*. In reckoning, *ten* is the point of variation for lower numbers, *ten thousand* for middle numbers, and *ten thousand ten thousand* for higher numbers.

Measures begin with the *inch* (忽), ten *inch* make a *sī* (丝), ten *sī* make a *lín* (厘), ten *lín* make a *háo* (毫), ten *háo* make a *fēn* (分), ten *fēn* make a *cùn* (寸), ten *cùn* make a *shǐ* (尺), ten *shǐ* make a *zhàng* (丈). Three *shǐ* make a *kuǐ* (跬), six *shǐ* make a *bù* (步), seven *shǐ* make a *rèn* (仞), eight *shǐ* make a *xún* (寻), double *xún* makes a *cháng* (常), three hundred *bù* make a *lǐ* (里), and two thousand nine hundred thirty-two *lǐ* make a *dù* (度).

Quantities begin with the *jī* (圭), six *millet grains* (粟) make a *jī*, ten *jī* make a *cuō* (抄), ten *cuō* make a *zuō* (撮), ten *zuō* make a *sháo* (勺), ten *sháo* make a *hé* (合), ten *hé* make a *shēng* (升), ten *shēng* make a *dǒu* (斗), ten *dǒu* make a *dàn* (石). Four *shēng* make a *dòu* (豆), four *dòu* make a *ōu* (瓯), four *ōu* make a *fǔ* (釜), four *fǔ* make a *zhōng* (钟). Sixteen *dǒu* make a *yú* (庾), six *dǒu* four *shēng* make an *hú* (斛), sixteen *dǒu* also make a *sǒu* (薮), and sixteen *hú* make a *bǐng* (秉). The *Book of Rites on Plenary Tributes* (聘礼) further states: ten *dǒu* is an *hú*, sixteen *dǒu* is a *sǒu*, and ten *sǒu* is a *bǐng*. Zheng Xuan (郑玄) also says: a *dǒu* with two *shēng* is an *hú*.

Weights begin with the *glutinous millet grain* (黍), ten *pí* (黍) make a *lěi* (累), ten *lěi* make a *zhū* (铢), twenty-four *zhū* make a *liǎng* (两), six *zhū* make a *fēn* (分), sixteen *liǎng* make a *jīn* (斤), thirty *jīn* make a *jūn* (钧), four *jūn* make a *shuò* (硕), and twenty *liǎng* make a *yì* (镒).

These four categories of reckoning are the methods of calculation used among people. The grandest reckoning measures Heaven and Earth, examines yin and yang—*creation* (造化) cannot conceal its mechanisms, and *spirits* (鬼神) cannot evade its numbers.

If those who cultivate the *Dao/Way* (修道之士) do not calculate divergent gates (不计异门) but merely uphold *oneness* (守一), why would they need calculation techniques (计术)?

*Oneness* (一) is the *Dao/Way* (道), the most noble and without pair. *Oneness* without *duality* (不二) is the origin of all transformations (万化之首), and nothing does not arise from it. Heaven attains *oneness* and thus achieves clarity (清), Earth attains *oneness* and thus achieves tranquility (宁). The elusive *phenomena of yin and yang* (恍惚之象) and the profound essence of the *Dao/Way* (杳冥之精) are all referred to as *oneness*.

The *sage* (圣人) embraces *oneness* to govern the world (法天下), the *perfected one* (至人) attains *oneness* to ascend to the heavens (升云天). Thus, *oneness* can preserve and can vanish, can obscure and can shine, can be round and can be square, can be soft and can be hard.

The thirsty seek *oneness*, and *oneness* grants them a ladle (桨). The hungry seek *oneness*, and *oneness* grants them grain (粮). By guarding *oneness*, one attains completion (守一以成). The *Dao/Way* is thus *virtuous calculation*—it does not rely on reckoning tools yet is inherently virtuous.

**Virtuous closure lacks gates and keys yet cannot be opened** (善闭无关键而不可开):
**Commentary:** When one does not calculate divergent gates, the *desire-heart* (欲心) naturally closes.

*Horizontal* (横) is called *gates* (关), *vertical* (竖) is called *keys* (键). *Virtuous conduct* (善行) and *virtuous speech* (善言) are without attachment or obstruction (不耽不滞), the mind is clear and pure (心照清净), and no dust of phenomena arises. Hence it is said: *Virtuous closure*, though lacking gates and keys, cannot be opened.

Thus it is said: *Virtuous closure lacks gates and keys yet cannot be opened*. The meaning is: gates and keys are established to limit what is *internal* and *external*. The *Appendix to the Book of Changes* (易□系) states: "Double gates and striking the *gè* (柝) to await violent guests," meaning gates and keys restrict and regulate opening and closing.

If a state practices *virtuous closure*, then it harmonizes with the *mysterious transformation* (玄化), achieving great unity (大同) near and far (遐迩). There are no external weapons (干戈), no frontier alarms (烽燧), and no need for gates or barriers (关堑) yet no one invades or encroaches. When the world follows the *Dao/Way*, the virtue lies in the four quarters (四夷)—this is the case.

If a state does not practice *virtuous closure*, then its four borders are fortified with ramparts (四郊多垒), and it raises armies to weary the land (厌境兴师). Though it has the natural defenses of mountains and rivers (山川之险) and the strongholds of gates and barriers (关防之固), its guardianship is not rooted in *virtue* (守之非德), conflicts arise within its walls (衅生墙庑), enemies emerge from within (敌起舟中). Though it has gates and barriers, none can control them. How could this be called *virtuous closure*?

Those who practice *virtuous cultivation* (善修行) guard the *true essence* (真), embrace *oneness* (抱一), have no desires nor schemes (无欲无营), and know that all dharma are *gates* (万法之门), marking the stages of cultivation (阶修之渐). They are not obstructed by dharma, nor attached to speech, do not calculate divergent gates, nor seek broad knowledge. They close the *three gates* (三关) and naturally attain stillness (闭而自静), dispel all thoughts (祛众念) and naturally find peace (而自安). Sensual pleasures cannot deceive their hearts, and noble titles cannot stir their ambitions. This is *virtuous closure*—how could it be opened?

The *virtuous knot* is tied without cords or bonds, yet cannot be undone.
**Note:** When one fully realizes true nature, it is originally rooted in emptiness and forgetting. If one can empty and forget, then the heart aligns with the Dao. Though no cords or bonds restrain it, how could it be undone and scattered?

**Culling:** This illustrates that those who practice *virtuous closure* align their hearts with the Dao.

*Knot* means *to bind*; *cord* means *rope*; *bond* means *to restrain*; *undone* means *scattered*.

Those who practice *sitting-forgetting* and abandon illumination, deeply resonating with the Dao’s source, are able to remain unentangled in all dharma. Binding their hearts to this, it is said to be *virtuous knotting*.

Those who use cords and bonds—when the cords slacken, the bonds are undone. But when the Dao binds, the heart grows still, and the Dao becomes profound. Even as myriad afflictions arise, one remains utterly unstained. Though no cords or bonds restrain it, how could it be undone and scattered? Thus it is said: *The virtuous knot has no cords or bonds, yet cannot be undone.*

**Meaning:** The knots of cords and bonds can be undone and scattered—this is the common way of the world. Binding people’s hearts may bring separation or union—this is the common way of human relations. But the *virtuous knotting* of governing the realm is like the *virtue* of Heaven, covering all things without exception; like the *benevolence* of Earth, bearing all things without exception; like the clarity of the Sun, illuminating all things without exception; like the fluidity of Water, nourishing all things without exception. Then the hearts of the myriad realms and the countless people can be knotted together, yet cannot be scattered.

Those who do not practice *virtuous knotting* rule with threats, enforce with decrees, constrain with laws, and coerce with force. Though people may fear them, the knot is only temporarily tied and will scatter. Once scattered, even if lured with rewards, enticed with benefits, honored with titles, or elevated with rank, the scattered heart cannot be knotted again.

For those bewildered in *self-cultivation*, they seek extensive knowledge, pursue esoteric arts and divinations, and though their learning increases daily, their hearts scatter more. Though they strive for simplicity to knit their hearts, it cannot be achieved.

Those who practice *virtuous cultivation* abandon all thoughts, maintain single-mindedness, remain still in alignment with the Dao, and merge with the true. No afflictions can intrude, no illusions can seduce. This *virtuous knotting*—how could it be undone?

Thus, the Sage always practices *virtuous salvation*, and so there are none abandoned.

**Culling:** *Thus* introduces what follows to clarify what precedes. Though the Sage’s heart is profound and tranquil, their teachings flow freely. They always employ the *Five Virtues* to save others, ensuring their words are naturally clear and reach the great compassion of equality, without partiality or exclusion. All people are guided with *virtuous inducement*, hence it is said: *The Sage always practices virtuous salvation, and so there are none abandoned.*

**Meaning:** The Sage refers to those who embody the Dao. The Sage always broadly induces people with *virtuous teachings*, and those who hear the Dharma all awaken to understanding. According to their depth, they inevitably gain benefit. The gates of awakening are numerous—some awaken through speech, some through teaching, some through scriptures, some through seeing forms. The paths to awakening vary, and the methods of inducement are many. With great compassion and equanimity, without favor or aversion, they guide each being into the Dharma gate. Once entered, they abandon evil and become virtuous. All become virtuous, and so there are none abandoned.

Those who are abandoned are those who commit evil deeds and harbor harmful intentions. When harmed, they become enemies. If evil is manifest, people may punish them. If evil is hidden, spirits may punish them. Those punished by humans and spirits are abandoned by both.

Now, if all practice virtuous deeds, free from evil and blame, all transform into virtuous beings—how could there be abandonment?

The *Five Virtues* refer to virtuous speech, virtuous action, virtuous calculation, virtuous closure, and virtuous knotting. The *Analects* states: *Confucius was skilled in inducing others.* *Inducing* means guiding and leading. He always practiced *virtuous salvation*, and so there were none abandoned.

**Note:** Thus, the Sage always employs these five *virtuous teachings* to guide others, and so there are none abandoned.

**Culling:** *Things* encompasses both sentient and insentient beings. By saving people with virtuous teachings, none are abandoned. By saving things with benevolent intent, none are abandoned. Thus, all living beings flourish naturally, without withering or injury. Hence it is said: *The Sage always practices virtuous salvation, and so there are none abandoned.*

**Meaning:** The Sage who embodies the Dao teaches the five *virtues* to guide people toward goodness, and all transform into virtuous beings, so there are none abandoned. Again, through non-action and non-doing, they do not labor over things, and all fulfill their nature without harm or injury—extending even to pigs and fish, benefiting grass and trees. All transform into virtuous beings, causing no harm to things. This illustrates the Sage’s salvation of things. Since nothing is harmed and all follow their natural course, it is said there are none abandoned. This is called *cloaked clarity.*

**Note:** *Cloaked* refers to subtle, hidden use.

The five *virtues* lie in forgetting and letting go, and forgetting and letting go leaves no trace, hence *cloaked use.* Cloaked use leads to awakening, hence *clarity.*

**Culling:** *Cloaked* means subtle use; *clarity* means awakening. Virtuous deeds save others through forgetting and letting go. If one clings to teachings or boasts of them, traces will remain. Though the Sage always practices virtuous salvation, they ultimately ensure the mind is unobstructed. Thus, through subtle use, one attains awakening, hence it is called *cloaked clarity.*

**Meaning:** The Sage’s intent lies in subtly employing virtuous deeds, achieving awakening without obstruction, leaving no traces—this is called *cloaked clarity.*

Again, *cloaked* means *continuation.* The human mind’s inherent nature is originally clear and pure, but obscured by defilements, veiling its true nature. Now, through the five *virtues*, the heart is internally purified, and true nature shines forth as originally. With wisdom’s illumination restored, one must constantly practice virtuous salvation, generating no false defilements. Continuing this luminous wisdom, preventing it from being obscured by darkness, without boasting of traces or clinging to conventions—this is *cloaked clarity.*

Thus, the virtuous person is the teacher of the non-virtuous.

**Annotation:** Teacher (*师*), here means **Dao/Way** (*法*).

The virtuous person, detached from all attachments and defilements, possesses a pure heart. Without obstruction in the Dao/Way (*於法无滞*), their teachings flow naturally and harmoniously. Taking water as an analogy: when objects approach, it reflects them. What it reflects are their forms and images (*照形而有象*), yet the water itself remains unperturbed, without clinging to any image (*能鉴者见象而无心*). The virtuous person’s wisdom is just like this—thus, they can serve as the Dao/Way (*师法*) for the non-virtuous.

**Explication:** The one who does not commit evil deeds, abides by the Dao/Way (*法*), follows the natural order (*循常*), harms neither others nor things (*无侵於人，无伤於物*)—this is the virtuous person. When people practice virtue, Heaven and Earth cherish them, and the divine spirits (*神明*) protect them. Though they do not study the Dao/Way and yet their actions align with it (*不习道而行合於道*), though they do not explicitly know the Dao/Way and yet their hearts resonate with it (*不明法而心契於法*), they harm neither things nor people, and thus things and people do not harm them (*不伤於物，物亦不伤之；不害於人，人亦不害之*). In this way, their every movement and stillness, their every action and reaction, consistently bring forth sincerity and good fortune (*常获贞吉*). The wicked, admiring their steadfast virtue and fortune, should also transform and become virtuous—thus, the virtuous can indeed be the teacher of the non-virtuous.

The *Spring and Autumn Annals* (*《春秋》*) records: When the people of Zheng gathered at the village school to discuss their rulers, Duke Mu of Zheng (*郑穆公*) wished to destroy the school for its criticism of governance. Child Xuan (*子产*) replied: If I were to visit it daily, hearing of the rulers’ virtues and faults (*闻执政之善否*), I would follow what is good (*其所善者，吾则行之*) and reform what is evil (*其所恶者，吾则改之*). This is my teacher (*是吾师也*).

The *Spring and Autumn Annals* further records: **"How could one destroy it? I have heard that loyalty and virtue diminish grievances, but I have never heard of using coercive power to prevent them. If one were to abruptly suppress it, that would be like blocking a river. When a river is dammed, the flooding will be severe, and it cannot be contained. It is better to allow a small breach so that it may flow naturally."** Thus, Child Xuan (*羊舌职*) rejoiced in his words.

Confucius said: **"People say that Child Xuan is not benevolent (*仁*), but I do not believe it."**

The *Book of Documents* (*《书》*) states: **"Those who can find their own teachers are sages (*圣人*)."** For a teacher is one who provides a model to follow (*有法可范之*).

The *Records of Learning* (*《学记》*) says: **"When one is settled in their studies and close to their teacher, when they delight in their companions and trust in the Dao/Way, even if they depart from their teacher’s guidance, they will not stray far. But if one conceals their learning while resenting their teacher, or if they perceive their difficulties without understanding their benefits, that is the opposite (*#1*)."**

The gentleman knows how teaching flourishes and how it perishes, and only then can they truly be a teacher to others. To study alone without companions is to be narrow and ill-informed; thus, selecting a teacher must be done with utmost care.

The *Spring and Autumn Annals*’s commentary states: **"I have heard that when Yu (*禹*) raised the virtuous, the non-virtuous were driven far away."** The *Book of Songs* (*《诗》*) says: **"Trembling and cautious, as if standing at the edge of a deep abyss, as if walking on thin ice. This is the virtuous in high position (*善人在上*), for when the virtuous lead, the state prospers without misfortune (*国无幸人*). The proliferation of the non-virtuous brings ruin to the state (*人之多幸，国之不幸*)—this is what is meant by the absence of the virtuous."**

Thus, the virtuous are the treasures of the state (*邦国之宝*), not merely teachers. The non-virtuous are the raw materials (*资*) of the virtuous.

**Annotation:** Teacher (*师*) refers to the law (*法*); raw materials (*资*) means to take (*取*). The virtuous can be emulated as teachers, while the non-virtuous can be utilized for service.

**Explication:** Raw materials (*资*) means to take (*取*). Fire has its heat, and cold and warmth depend on it. One who diligently practices the Dao/Way must rely on masters and craftsmen (*资宗匠*). If they take pleasure in the virtues of their elders, they must also submit to the labor of their juniors. Thus, the non-virtuous can be taken and employed by the virtuous.

The commentary further states: **"The virtuous, through their virtuous conduct, can transform the non-virtuous, who will then admire and submit to them, serving as their laborers."** The *Analects* (*《论语》*) says: **"When there is work, the juniors serve with labor (*有事弟子服其劳*)."** The elders are the father, elder brothers, teachers, and leaders (*先生者，父兄师长也*).** Therefore, the juniors serve their teachers with reverence and follow their instruction (*事师，服膺从教也*).

In a person’s conduct, there are three reverences (*三尊*).** They serve their parents with filial piety (*事父母以孝*), their ruler with loyalty (*事君以忠*), and their teacher with respect (*事师以敬*).** The body and its limbs are given by their parents (*身体发肤，父母生之*);** virtue, power, rituals, and music are taught by their teacher (*道德礼乐，师以教之*);** and rank, honors, and status are bestowed by their ruler (*爵禄品位，君以荣之*).** Even if the Dao/Way exists, one may still seek instruction from a teacher without fixed reverence—any ritual of requesting benefit will naturally evoke the threefold respect.

If one does not honor their teacher, they will not cherish their raw materials. **Annotation:** This chapter’s profound meaning lies in the teaching of mutual forgetting. If one retains the distinction between teacher and student, that is not the ultimate goal. Now, honoring the teacher is to preserve the relationship of learning. Once that relationship is dissolved, there is nothing left to honor. Cherishing raw materials is to preserve the relationship of teaching. When teaching is forgotten, one no longer cherishes raw materials. To honor and cherish while forgetting both is for the Dao/Way to naturally transform. Though it seems like great confusion (*大迷*), this is called the essential mystery (*要妙*).**

**Annotation:** Forgetting both teacher and student is called *mysterious virtue* (*玄德*). The common mind does not understand this, deeming it great confusion. Observed through the Dao/Way, it is called the essential (*要*).**

**Explication:** In the early stages of cultivation, one retains the duality of teacher and student, unable yet to forget the spoken teachings. Therefore, they honor and cherish their teacher and raw materials. If one attains true insight into the path of practice, then study becomes effortless. Once the names of teacher and student are lost, the distinctions of honor and cherishment vanish.

The commentary states: **"Those in the early stages of cultivation—meaning those who awaken from the mundane and turn toward the true Dao/Way, abandoning the mundane for faith in the path—are called those of the initial stage. The *Sutra of the Original Source* (*《本际经》*) says: 'For those who study, the initial ten practices form the steps. Like a person ascending a ladder, from the first rung to the second, up to the top, those ascending must first practice these ten methods before entering deep meditation.

1. Those of the initial stage first cultivate wholesome desires (*善欲*), with a heart that delights in good and seeks it, thus able to advance.
2. They associate with virtuous companions (*善友*), who guide their hearts, deepening their faith in the true Dao/Way.
3. They approach a wise teacher (*明师*), who possesses profound methods and can broadly proclaim them, revealing the essential techniques.
4. Having heard the true teachings, they accept and recite them.
5. They are able to leave home, practicing gentleness and humility, permanently severing worldly attachments, and freeing themselves from all shackles (*永断有为，离诸桎梏*).**"**

Sixth, they receive the true precepts (*正戒*), guarding body, speech, and mind.

Seventh, they retreat into secluded mountains and forests, dwelling alone in solitude, seeking to escape the clamor of the world and cultivate a tranquil mind (*寂静志*).

Eighth, they should reflect that the Great Dao/Way is the true *Dharma King* (*法王*), capable of delivering all beings, crossing the sea of birth and death, just as a shipmaster rescues the drowning.

Ninth, they should reflect that the scriptures are the wondrous medical prescriptions (*妙医方*), able to show all beings the remedies for their afflictions (*烦恼*).

Tenth, they should reflect that the *Dharma Master* (*法师*) is the true parent, skillfully giving birth to the *Dharma-body* (*法身*) and the wisdom of life.

These ten methods form the stages of practice.

Those of the initial stage first cultivate the *Hīnayana* methods of gentle subjugation (*小乘柔伏之法*), then advance to the *Madhyamaka* methods of cultivation (*中乘进修之法*), and finally enter the *Mahayana* practice of insight and conduct (*大乘观行之法*).

Because of these methods, one should hold teachers in high regard.

The teacher is like a father.

Without a teacher, one cannot attain the Dao/Way.

Therefore, one should follow and attend to them, near or far, keeping them ever before the mind and eyes, never wavering for an instant, without any other distracting thoughts. Without a teacher, one cannot be enlightened; without a teacher, one cannot become transcendent (*不仙*).

Once one has attained self-realization, all learned forms and teachings are seen as empty.

All skillful means are beyond words.

Having understood the Great Dao/Way, one transcends both reverence and attachment.

Entering the gates of supreme mystery, one attains the realm of true constancy (*真常境*).

**Commentary:**
This chapter teaches the principle of letting go and forgetting.

Through gradual and sudden methods, it establishes stages.

When discussing ultimate realization, all teachings are empty.

Thus, earlier it speaks of honoring teachers and valuing teachings to show the path of cultivation.

Later, it speaks of neither honoring nor valuing, guiding one toward awakening and realization.

Therefore, the reason to honor the teacher is to uphold the forms of learning.

Once learning’s forms are seen as empty, there is nothing to honor.

The reason to value teachings is to uphold their forms.

When both teaching and learning are forgotten, there is no attachment.

When forms are forgotten, all traces vanish.

At first hearing, the common and unenlightened may not understand, clinging to learning and teachings, and thus deem this as great delusion.

Hence, Laozi’s measured words: *"Though the common may call this great delusion, in terms of the Dao/Way, this is called the supreme mystery."*

**Explanation:**
The teacher’s path and the interdependence of teacher and student are like this:

Jade is shaped into a vessel through polishing; humans awaken to the Dao/Way through the teacher.

It is said that in terms of teachings, there are methods of remembering and honoring the teacher, established to instruct people. Across ages, these precepts have varied, and those unskilled may temporarily rely on them for guidance.

Thus, the Son of Heaven performs the *Dingdian* ritual for the ancestral teacher, and the heir apparent visits the ancestral teacher at the Grand Academy—all to preserve the Dao/Way and pass it down.

Yet, from the perspective of ultimate insight, one forgets heaven and earth, forgets the self within, and forgets all distinctions between self and other—how much more so would one forget the limits of teacher and student?

As when *Nièqué* (*啮缺*) questioned *Bìyī* (*被衣*), who said:
*"Rectify your form, unify your gaze—*Heaven’s harmony* (*天和*) is near.
Concentrate your knowing, unify your measure—*the Spirit* will come to dwell.
Virtue will become your adornment, the Dao/Way your abode.
Your pupils will shine like those of a newborn calf, yet you will not seek its cause."

Before he finished speaking, *Nièqué* fell into deep sleep.
*Bìyī* rejoiced greatly, sang as he walked, and departed, saying:
*"Your form is withered like dead wood, your mind like ashes—
True and real knowing, not clinging to the past.
Obscure and indistinct, without thought, yet beyond counsel.
Who is this person?
He is one who, in the midst of transformation, alone achieves change."

At that moment, *Nièqué* had forgotten both his body and the heavens and earth—how much more so would he forget his teacher?

Thus, the principle of honoring and valuing teachers is fully realized.

In governing the realm, one does not establish virtue in people nor flaunt benevolence toward things.
The common folk live their daily lives without knowing it,
and naturally there is no reverence for teachers or valuing of teachings—
this aligns with the ancient Dao/Way of the unspoken.

Most do not understand; initially, this seems great delusion.
Yet when realized, it is indeed the supreme mystery.

*"Móu mò"* (*濡沬*)—this is Laozi’s response to Confucius in the *"Tian Yun"* (*天运*) chapter of the *Zhuangzi*.

**Volume Twenty-Four: The Duke Guangcheng of Tang, Master Du Guangting’s Commentary**

**#28** *"Knowing Its Heroic Virtue"* (*知其雄章*)
**Commentary:** The previous chapter expounded that actions and words do not cling to fixed goodness; thus, it saved people. This chapter reveals that humility and yielding are the way, and virtue/power returns to its original simplicity. It first marks the three stages of knowing heroic virtue, showing that through practice, one gradually attains the ultimate. Then it speaks of simplicity and scattering in the next two lines, illustrating that attaining the ultimate must lead to fruition. Finally, it concludes with *"Great Measure"* (*大制*), discussing the sage’s governance and purpose in exploring its meaning.

**Meaning:** The previous chapter stated that neither clinging to goodness in actions nor goodness in words is the way to save people; saving people and things through such means is merely external assistance. This chapter emphasizes knowing heroic virtue and knowing purity to preserve harmony in one’s qi. Returning to simplicity and innocence is the key to success—internal cultivation’s essence. External actions manifest the Five Virtues; as stated above. Internal cultivation reaches the three stages of knowing—its ultimate state, as explained below. When cultivation returns to simplicity, one need not rigidly uphold simplicity to remain unshaken, then scattering and manifesting all differences to display the profound and boundless workings of the Dao, only the sage can govern this with perfect measure, without harm or injury.

Knowing its heroic virtue, upholding its yielding nature—this is the way to be the valley of the world.
**Commentary:** Knowing (*知*) means discernment. Heroic (*雄*) refers to rigidity and impetuosity. Yielding (*雌*) signifies gentleness and tranquility. Things value complete harmony; methods seek the middle Dao/Way. Rigidity (*雄*) is excessive, yielding (*雌*) is too weak; neither aligns with the proper path of virtuous action. One must follow deep sincerity as the guiding principle. Thus, knowing its rigidity and impetuosity, one must uphold its gentleness and tranquility. Upholding gentleness and tranquility also requires knowing rigidity and impetuosity. If one upholds yielding but does not know heroic virtue, it leads to ruin; ruin obstructs action. Therefore, one must maintain precepts and uphold yielding. To uphold yielding gentleness is to embody the virtue of humility, which all things naturally gravitate toward—like water flowing to valleys.

**Meaning:** In internal cultivation, discerning rigidity and impetuosity, one knows they must lead to ruin and injury. Thus, one must govern them with the Dao of yielding gentleness. *Excessive* (*亢*) means extreme; *sincere* (*笃*) means thick or profound. If one’s nature is rigid and impetuous, it tends toward extremes; extremes bring ruin and excess. Therefore, one must cultivate a profound and sincere gentle nature to govern the heroic and rigid disposition, thereby avoiding extreme ruin. A valley is where all streams converge because of its humble and lowly nature. If a person is humble and lowly, things gravitate toward them; if the earth is humble and lowly, water gathers. In the upper simplicity, there is the Dao of the One Yielding, and also the methods of the Three Flees and Five Yieldings—all of which weaken the will, harmonize the spirit, and lead to longevity.

To govern the realm with humility and tranquility means all things follow in accord, like water rushing to valleys. To be the valley of the world is to never depart from constant virtue/power, returning once more to the innocence of the infant.

**Annotation:** Heroic virtue (*雄*) suffers from excessive vigor; thus, knowing its heroic nature means one must uphold yielding gentleness. Humility attracts things, making one the valley of the world. Constant virtue/power does not scatter, embracing Dao and harmony, and returning to the innocent actions of the infant.

**Commentary:** Knowing heroic virtue and upholding yielding nature is the path of virtuous action, which all things gravitate toward—making one the valley of the world. Those who can do this will never see their constant virtue/power depart or scatter. If virtue/power does not scatter, it is complete harmony. Those with complete harmony think little and desire little, their stillness unmarked—like an infant. Hence it says, *"returning once more to the innocence of the infant."*

**Meaning:** Governing the realm lies in humility and tranquility; governing oneself lies in yielding gentleness. If all things follow in accord and all virtues converge, one will constantly enjoy their blessings and preserve their body. The infant represents one who has not yet distinguished good from evil or right from wrong, whose harmony in qi is always complete, and whose stillness is profound and concentrated—an analogy for a virtuous ruler or one who embodies the Dao. Such virtue aligns with the true Dao. In governing oneself, the spirit converges; in governing the realm, the people gather in harmony.

「Knowing its clarity, preserving its obscurity, one becomes the model for all under Heaven.

**Commentary:** Clarity is illumination. Obscurity is dimness. Model is law/pattern.
He who can preserve the gentle stillness of the female principle will have virtue and conduct made manifest.
Though virtue be manifest, he does not boast before others.
When in a state of dimness, he guards his simplicity and harmony.
If one can thus act, he may be taken as the model for all under Heaven.

**Meaning:** A ruler’s unique insight is his virtue; the Way’s luminous power is its conduct.
Both must be like the dim and obscure—unassuming, not vainglorious—
Then the common folk will flock to him, his simplicity and harmony sufficient within.
Thus he becomes the model for all under Heaven.
In the *Records of the Grand Historian*, the Old Master told Confucius:
“A gentleman of great virtue appears as if foolish”—this is it.
He who has virtue yet does not boast, who has insight yet does not display it,
Not only fills his inner being with the Way’s conduct,
But also attains the harmony of sound and light.

To be the model for all under Heaven,
One’s virtue must never falter,
And returns once more to the boundless.

**Commentary:** He who can preserve the gentle stillness,
His virtue will never scatter.
Though virtue be clear, he must act as if obscure,
Thus he becomes the model for all under Heaven.
Virtue applied without fail,
Never deviates or errs—its use is boundless.
Hence it returns once more to the boundless.

**Translation:** Falter is error. Boundless is the utmost.
Knowing clarity yet preserving obscurity—this is called virtue complete.
The man of complete virtue may be the model for all under Heaven.
Then the true virtue, ever constant,
Follows and applies without fail—
Its application never errs, its use is boundless.
Hence it says, *returns once more to the boundless.*

**Meaning:** In ruling and in the Way,
He veils his brilliance outwardly,
Yet accumulates his virtue within.
Once simplicity and harmony are established,
All under Heaven transforms accordingly.
For the realm, the sage’s virtue is boundless;
For oneself, longevity is without end.
Knowing its glory, preserving its humiliation,
One becomes the valley for all under Heaven.

**Commentary:** Glory is honor and elevation.
Humiliation is lowliness and disgrace.
He who is the model for all under Heaven
Has his virtue in a state of honor and elevation.
Though virtue be honored and exalted,
He must always guard against humiliation,
Using harmony as his measure—
All things are contained without exclusion.
Like an empty valley, where all things come and are answered,
Hence it says, *he is the valley for all under Heaven.*

**Meaning:** A ruler’s wealth is the eightfold perfection,
His dominion extends to the ninefold boundaries—
This is his honor and elevation.
Yet he calls himself “lonely and bereaved,” not the valley—
This is his humiliation.
The titles he assumes are the ancient institutions.
If one can govern while in chaos,
Reside in peace yet fear danger,
Be ever vigilant and humble,
Daytime earnest and nighttime watchful,
Then his virtue is vast, his body broad—
Like an empty valley.

The man of the Way outwardly displays his virtue’s praise,
Yet inwardly guards his humility and gentleness,
Like Gang Sang who avoided the mountain and feared the mountain shrine.
Zhuangzi sighed over the swollen, useless tree—
Its material and virtue were not displayed,
Yet its heart was empty, its virtue complete—
Like an empty valley.

To be the valley for all under Heaven,
His virtue is ever sufficient,
And returns once more to the uncarved.

**Commentary:** Though virtue be honored and exalted,
He must always guard against humiliation.
Things respond as they sense him—
Like a valley echoing sound.
Empty yet receptive without end,
His virtue is whole and complete.
Thus he returns once more to the Dao.

**Translation:** Uncarved is the Dao.
Empty yet receptive, answering all things—
Like the spirit of the valley,
The true virtue is whole and complete.
Whole, it returns once more to the uncarved.

The Dao is the body of virtue;
Virtue is the application of the Dao.
Speaking of its application, it says, *“His virtue is ever sufficient.”*
Speaking of its body, it says, *“Returns once more to the uncarved.”*
Returning to the uncarved, its wondrous origin is pure and clear;
Ever-sufficient virtue follows and applies without end.
Is there not the utmost harmony under Heaven,
Who could join with this?

**Meanary:** Once rich in virtue, he aligns with the Dao.
The Dao as virtue’s body is tranquil and without action.
Virtue as the Dao’s application is active and transformative.
A ruler, with the fivefold harmonies of governance,
Lures the people toward non-action,
With the boundless virtue of broad relief,
Accumulating merit to align with the Dao.
Hence it says, *“Returns once more to the uncarved.”*

The Dao is without action yet does nothing it does not act upon,
Generating all things, responding to change without measure.
Hence it is called the utmost harmony under Heaven.
*The Book of Changes* says:
“That which is above form is called the Dao;
Pushing it forth to action is called harmony.”
This is it.

In the sage’s governance of the realm,
And the noble man’s cultivation of himself,
They must know that the three—heroic strength, clarity, and glory—
Are not lasting benefits,
But rather grasp the three conducts—gentleness, obscurity, and humiliation—to regulate them.
Then the fivefold harmonies outwardly transform the people,
While these three conducts inwardly refine oneself—
The people transformed, the Way grows ever broader;
The self refined, virtue flourishes ever more.
The Way broadens, virtue flourishes—
This is the utmost essential in governing the realm and oneself.

The uncarved disperses and becomes the vessel;
The sage employs it, and it becomes the official and leader.

**Commentary:** Containing virtue within, harmonized,
It returns once more to the uncarved.
Ever-sufficient virtue applied,
Disperses and becomes the vessel.
Once involved in form and function,
There must be distinctions of fine and coarse.
Hence the sage employs it,
And it becomes the chief of all materials and officials.

**Translation:** Vessel is form and function.
Self-aware of heroic strength below,
Discussing nature and refining virtue,
Returning, it once more aligns with the Dao.
This says, *“The uncarved disperses and becomes the vessel,”*
Illuminating that virtue complete aligns with the Dao—
Then he can follow and apply.
Applied, its traces are coarse, involved in form and function,
Hence it says, *“The uncarved disperses and becomes the vessel.”*
The sage’s broad relief,
Becomes the chief of all materials and officials.

**Meaning:** That which is above form is called the Dao;
That which is below form is called the vessel.
The Dao is the void—
Not the visible or tangible essence,
But the wondrous origin of emptiness and tranquility.
The vessel involves the having—
The knowable and describable application,
Not the obstructed or fixed form.
The sage governs all under Heaven,
Employs the people and their virtues,
Entrusting them to shepherds,
Sharing the profound winds together,
To broaden the Way’s transformation.
Hence it says, *“Becomes the official and leader.”*

The vastness of the four seas,
The multitude of the myriad folk,
Cannot be governed by one man alone—
Thus officials, teachers, and leaders are established,
Each assuming their proper tasks.
In ancient times, Tang and Yu established only a hundred officials;
The Xia, Shang, Zhou, and Han increased them further,
Appointing men by their virtue,
Assigning them tasks by their abilities,
Each fitting their vessel—
And thus all directions were governed.»

「If one is a practitioner of the Dao/Way, then they spread virtue and bestow kindness,
rescue beings and establish merit—
just as vessels serve their function,
to benefit the people.

To govern a state, one employs talent and transforms beings;
to practice the Dao/Way, one applies merit and aids humanity—
this aligns with the pure transformation of the Dao/Way.

The *Shàngshū* says, *“Learn from the ancients to enter office,”*
and the *Zuǒzhuàn* states, *“One who governs the people without covetous intent.”*
This is the principle.

In the autumn of the seventeenth year of Duke Zhāo of *Chūnqiū*,
the Lord of Tán came to Lǔ and spoke to Zhāo:
“The Yellow Emperor appointed officials by the *yún* (cloud),
the Yán Emperor by fire,
Gònggōng by water,
Tàihào by dragons,
Shàohào by birds—
using the *fèng* (august) bird as the Keeper of the Calendar,
the *xuānnǐao* (dark) bird as the Keeper of the Seasons,
Bózhào as the Keeper of the Solstices,
Qīngniǎo as the Keeper of the Opening,
Dānniǎo as the Keeper of the Closing,
and Zhùjiū as the Grand Minister,
Suījiū as the Marshal,
Shījiū as the Director of Works,
Shuǎngjiū as the Censor,
and Hújiū as the Keeper of Affairs.
The five *jiū* (birds) were entrusted to govern the people,
the five *zhì* (pheasants) were appointed as the five Craftsmen,
and the nine *hù* (helpers) as the nine Agricultural Overseers.
*Hù* means “to restrain,”
restraining the people so they do not indulge in excess.”

Since the time of *Zhuānxū*,
the mandate could not be sustained at a distance—
thus, the role of “People’s Teacher” was established,
and the people themselves were appointed as officials.
The division of offices to restrain and guide
is an ancient practice.

It is for the purpose of proclaiming the Dao/Way and enacting virtue,
to teach the people.
If officials are not the right men,
harm befalls the beings.
How can one entrust them lightly?
The *Shū* says: *“Offices need not be complete; only their people matter.”*
This is its meaning.

Hence, the “Great Measure” does not involve cutting or harming.
**Annotation:** The sage employs the Dao/Way,
the Great Measure governs all beings—
warm like spring, beneficent without ceasing,
animals and plants all flourish,
yet nothing is cut or harmed.
**Commentary:** This illustrates the sage’s use of the Dao/Way.

The sage’s virtue is complete;
the Great Measure governs all things—
following the application of Heaven and Earth,
bestowing the恩 of rain and dew,
each attaining its harmony,
unaware of its force.
The sage ensures that all moving and rooted beings flourish,
yet nothing is cut or harmed for their own use.
Hence it says, *“The Great Measure does not involve cutting.”*

**Meaning:** The holy sovereign rules the extremes,
governing all directions.
Their virtue covers all beings,
each attaining its nature.
Thus, animals and plants,
sentient and insentient,
grow and complete themselves naturally—
neither slaughtered nor cut.
In the age of *Xuāndé* (Mysterious Virtue),
the *Tàishàng* (Supreme Sage) does not speak or transform,
only remaining serene and still,
while those below recognize their sovereign above
yet do not hear the laws of their governance.
This is what is meant by:
*“The Great Measure is the sovereign ruler,
yet does not involve cutting or harming.”*

A practitioner of the Dao/Way
does not obsess over the *zhù* (sacrificial rites),
nor toil endlessly over *shùyàn* (ritual mouth-washing);
without action or desire,
they preserve their natural harmony—
and thus may ascend to the Dao/Way.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: *“On Those Who Would Seize the World”***

**Commentary:** The previous chapter expounds on the conduct of humility,
demonstrating that enduring virtue must return to simplicity.
This chapter reveals that arrogance and grasping will inevitably fail—
thus, the divine vessel cannot be forced.

First, the six sentences under *“On those who would seize”* establish
the reality that power has its proper place,
warning against deceitful and turbulent officials.
Next, *“The one who grasps”* shows that numerical cycles do not interfere with the constant,
admonishing the licentious and dissolute sovereign.
Hence, the following passage distinguishes the patterns of dependence and subjugation—
thus, the sage warns the ruler against extreme tyranny.

**Meaning:** The previous section clarified how the sage governs all beings.
Here, one fears that officials may disrupt the constant,
so this passage is raised to warn against their deceitful schemes.
Again, one worries that a ruler may arrogantly claim divine authority,
oppressing the people—
thus, it is shown that dependence and subjugation are not constant,
and that ruin lies in departing from virtue.
Avoiding extravagance and excess,
one may preserve the enduring mandate.

Hence it says:
*“To warn against deceitful officials below,
and to admonish the licentious sovereign above.”*

If one seeks to seize the world and do so,
I see that they cannot achieve it.

**Annotation:** The world is the position of the great treasure.
Those who practice the Dao/Way must await the numerical cycles aligning with their person.
If it is one who disrupts the order by force,
seeking to seize the world as their sovereign—
the Old Master warns: *“I see that they cannot achieve it.”*
**Commentary:** The world is the position of the great treasure.
The august Heaven commands the Emperor,
the Great Measure governs all beings—
this must await the numerical cycles aligning with their person,
before they rule over the ten thousand realms.
Yet deceitful rebels and violent men,
who seek to seize the world by force and claim sovereignty,
will have neither time to exterminate nor hope to inherit Heaven’s mandate.
Thus, the Old Master warns:
*“I see that such a person will inevitably fail in their undertaking.”*
*Yǐ* is a grammatical particle.

**Meaning:** Under all Heaven,
the sovereign governs.
The sovereign’s position is granted by Heaven’s command,
where numerical cycles converge,
the will of Heaven responds,
and the people’s aspirations align—
only then may they rule the four seas,
nurture all beings,
and serve as sovereign.

All have inherited traditions of accumulated virtue,
and borne extraordinary omens in their persons.
*Yùxī* (Great Track) was born from the divine turtle’s tracks,
and *Yánhuáng* (Flame Sovereign) was conceived by the dragon’s presence.
*Xuānyuán* (Yellow Emperor) was surrounded by lightning as he circled the Dipper,
and *Shàohào* (Minor Sovereign) was adorned with starry hues flowing like a rainbow.
*Zhuānxū* (High-Sin) and *Gāoxīn* (High-Xin) were endowed with wisdom and sagacity,
while *Yáo* (Emperor Yao) and *Shùn* (Emperor Shun) exhibited divine omens beyond mortal kind.
*Yáo*’s fire virtue manifested in the red dragon,
and *Shùn*’s earthly virtue in the rainbow’s auspicious sign.
The moon’s essence bestowed upon *Yǔ* (Yü the Great),
and the swallow’s egg upon *Tāng* (Tang of Shang).
Purple vapor gathered over *Yángshān* (Yang Mountain),
and red light shone upon the Han dynasty—
these are all cases of extraordinary omens in their persons.

Accumulating mysterious merit, *Huángxuán* (Yellow Emperor) received the mandate,
and observing the past’s achievements, *Zhuānxū* (High-Sin) was confirmed in his succession.
The Yellow Emperor’s lineage endured seventeen generations before *Yīntāng* (Tang of Yin) inherited the blessing,
and *Hòujì* (Later Ji) flourished in the thirteenth generation after *Xībó* (Western King).
These are all cases of accumulated merit over generations.

Some are born with divine holiness,
others emerge speaking with wisdom—
with a sun-like mark on their foreheads,
or dragon-like features and crane-like steps.
With double pupils and eight colors,
or reversed feathers and strange fur.
With a jade dipper across their bodies,
or scales covering their forms.
Some remain whole within prison walls,
others escape from ditches and sewers—
yet still respond to Heaven’s omens,
their virtue harmonizing with the people’s wishes,
before they drive noble steeds,
command great heroes,
rescue the drowning,
save the burning,
and bring prosperity to the common folk,
thus fulfilling the mandate to expand the imperial enterprise.
This may be called the fulfillment of all beings’ hopes,
where numerical cycles align with their person.»

The *Shan Shu* declares: *"Heaven’s numerical cycles rest upon your person alone."*

If one lacks divine appointment, if talent is not Heaven-endowed,
if accumulated virtue does not shine through ancestors,
if no strange omens herald their birth—
relying on mere brute strength,
harboring the heart of a wolf,
using sly allure to seize state power,
exploiting favoritism to covet the sacred throne—
plotting to question the cauldron’s fate,
scheming to steal the imperial seals—
then Wang Mang and Dong Zhuo meet their doom in slaughter,
while Hou Jing and Sun En perish in defeat.
Their infamy lingers through the ages,
mocked by all under Heaven.
To force such a path—can it succeed?

Even if one boasts of divine favor,
claims strength to uproot mountains,
whose very voice makes ghosts cower and gods tremble,
whose command shatters armies—
yet still, their ships founder in vain,
their necks meet the blade in treachery.
No blessings gather at the well,
only the rewards of the Five Dukes.
If they fail to reach this mark,
how dare they usurp what they never deserved?

The Venerable Master warned: *"I see their desperation."*

The Great Treasure’s seat—its meaning is already explained.
Heaven’s sacred instrument cannot be seized.
To seize it brings ruin.
*Note: The Great Treasure’s seat is the divine instrument of Heaven and Earth; thus, it cannot be taken by force.*

Therefore, it is said: *"To seize it brings ruin."*
This warns the treacherous ministers.

The *Exposition* states:
The Great Treasure’s seat cannot be seized by force,
for it is the divine instrument of Heaven and Earth,
meant for the eternal ruler of virtue,
to spread the harmonious and joyful transformations,
not to let a cruel tyrant wield it and poison the realm.
Thus, to seize it is impossible—
and if attempted, it must fail.
This warns the treacherous ministers who would usurp.

The *Meaning* explains:
*"Heaven’s spirit"* is called *shen*,
*"Earth’s spirit"* is called *zhi*,
*"The radiance of sun and moon"* is called *ming*.
Between Heaven and Earth, all things flourish under governance.
Thus, Heaven and Earth’s divine authority governs this,
bestowing the Great Seat upon the virtuous ruler,
to spread the transformations of joy and ease,
nurturing the people.
*Kai* means joy.
*Ti* means ease.
In the *"Dongzhao"* of the *Great Odes*, the Duke of Zhou admonished King Cheng:
*"The joyful and easy ruler—
the people’s parents."*
For joy strengthens their teachings,
ease brings comfort to the people,
so the people revere their ruler as father and mother.
Thus, it is called the transformation of *kai-ti*.

But if a cruel tyrant seizes the realm by force,
he must rule with brutal armies,
slaughtering and harming the people—
like Wu Zixu, the boar and serpent,
or Xiang Yu, the wolf devouring sheep.
Then the people suffer their venom.
Poison from the mouth is called *shi*,
poison from the tail is called *chi*.
This shows that such tyrants,
poisoning the realm,
can never claim the Great Treasure’s seat
without bringing ruin upon themselves.
Thus, it is said: *"To seize it brings ruin."*

Those who grasp at it will lose it.

**Translation:**

**Commentary:** When calamities befall one’s person,
already having obtained the ruler’s seat,
yet still grasping at this position,
oppressing and harming the sovereign’s spirit,
the Dao/Way will bring ruin and misfortune—
it will surely cause one to lose it.
This is a warning to emperors and kings.

**Exegesis:** A ruler may either
restore order and rectify chaos,
or uphold tradition and guard the Way.
Both must strive to reveal virtue and block faults,
relieve the hidden and seek out suffering.
If instead one grasps at this position,
oppressing and harming the sovereign’s spirit,
while allowing the country to fall into disorder without remedy,
then the Dao/Way will bring ruin and misfortune,
the gods will be enraged and the people will resent—
thus disasters arise like sand,
chaos and exile spread.
Who will still serve as their ruler?
They will surely lose this seat.
This is also a warning to emperors and kings.

**Meaning:** When a ruler inherits the Mandate of Heaven (*tian*),
yet does not act with virtue,
poison flows throughout the land,
disaster erupts within the world—
their commands are not obeyed,
weapons turn inward against them.
Once the realm is in chaos,
the seas and mountains boil.
The true sovereign, in response to the times,
will arise to save the people,
restore order and rectify chaos—
such as Xia Yu, Shang Tang, Zhou Wu, and Han Zu,
the founders of dynasties.

When the realm is settled,
it is passed to their descendants.
Thus, the succeeding ruler upholds the bright Way,
guards tradition and continues the succession—
like Xia Jie, Shang Zhou, Zhou Liang, and Han Xian,
the rulers who inherit the throne.

Indeed, the founders of dynasties
must rely on sacred virtue,
block faults and make amends,
reveal virtue and manifest benevolence,
attract the loyal and rescue the lost,
seek out the suffering and the sick.
At first, they hold the Great Treasure’s seat,
rarely meeting ruin or defeat.
For they strive diligently to seek the Way.

But those who inherit the throne,
unfamiliar with the labor of tilling and reaping,
grown in women’s hands,
born in deep palaces,
with the eight melodies and five colors
disturbing their hearts,
luxurious attire and seductive sounds
corrupting their nature—
some exhaust military strength at the borders,
spread poison across the nine regions,
regard their own children as enemies,
view the people as grass to be trampled,
and their actions bring only slaughter.
They do not follow constitutional norms,
but instead reverse the Dao/Way and defy Heaven,
oppressing and harming the sovereign’s spirit.
The sovereign’s spirit refers to the people,
and thus wars erupt in all four directions,
floods and droughts come untimely,
the gods are enraged, the people abandon,
ghosts weep and the people resent—
leading to exile at Nan Chao,
or the fall at Mu Ye,
dying among the common folk,
losing power to treacherous tyrants,
their grand designs forever gone,
their great achievements never returned.
This clearly illustrates *"To grasp it brings ruin,"*
a lesson for future rulers.

Those who reveal virtue and block faults—
in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Huan of the second year,
Song Hua Du killed Kong Jia Fu,
then assassinated Duke Zheng,
and installed Gong Zi Ping as Duke Zhuang.
He placed the Guo tripod as a bribe before Duke Heng of Lu,
who accepted it in the ancestral temple.
The minister Zang Ai Bo remonstrated:
*"A ruler must reveal virtue and block faults,
to govern over all officials,
yet still fear losing it.
Now you place this bribe-tripod in the great ancestral temple,
making it clear to all officials.
If the officials follow this example,
what need is there for punishment?
In ancient times, King Wu conquered Shang
and moved the Nine Tripods to Le Yi.
Even the virtuous still criticized this,
how much more so to place a tripod that reveals faults and violates rites
in the great ancestral temple?
What crimes will this ruler commit?"*

Things may either move forward or follow behind,

**Commentary:** To reveal virtue leads to ruin,
to grasp leads to loss—
thus things either move forward before you,
or follow behind you,
or warm you with their breath,
or chill you with their wind,
or support you and make you strong,
or suppress you and make you weak.
When there is the Dao/Way, they bear undertakings,
when there is no virtue, they bring ruin.

**Exegesis:** This shows that all things are not constant,
but shift and depend.
How can one long preserve them?

Thus, *"To grasp it brings ruin,"*
*"To seize it leads to loss"*—
sometimes those who come later take precedence,
sometimes those who were first fall behind,
sometimes the cold turns warm,
sometimes the warm becomes cold,
sometimes the weak grow strong,
sometimes the strong grow weak,
sometimes the successful bring ruin,
sometimes the ruined achieve wholeness.
Like tangled ropes, without a fixed standard or measure.

A ruler without the Dao/Way
makes people follow their desires,
while a ruler with the Dao/Way
makes desires follow the people.

Those who make desires follow the people—
the realm rejoices and honors them,
never wearying of their virtue.

Those who make people follow desires—
as recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Xi of the twentieth year,
Duke Sheng of Song wished to unite the feudal lords,
and Zang Wen Zhong heard this and said:
*"To make desires follow the people is possible,
but to make people follow desires will rarely succeed."*
He meant to yield one’s own desires
and follow the good of the many.

The following autumn,
Duke Sheng of Song allied with Chu, Chen, Cai, Zheng, Xu, and Cao at Meng.
The feudal lords seized Duke Sheng of Song
and attacked Song together.
This shows that Duke Sheng of Song,
lacking virtue, sought to form the alliance,
and the many seized him in punishment.
As Zang Wen Zhong had spoken.
Zang Wen Zhong was a minister of Lu.**

The Sage removes excess, removes extravagance, removes excessiveness.
**Note:** The Sage, observing how things follow their course, knows that those who cling will inevitably lose, hence he avoids what is overdone.

**Commentary:** Thus, the Sage who governs the world, seeing that what follows its course is not constant, knowing that arrogance and clinging will inevitably lead to loss, restrains himself, disciplines his body, curtails greed, and controls desires. He rejects the most extreme forms of artificiality, avoids the most extravagant adornments. Though the names are divided into three categories, their essence aligns with a single principle.

Excess, extravagance, and excessiveness—all are forms of overindulgence.
**Meaning:** The Sage, in his governance of the world, observes the interplay of rise and fall, discerns the mechanisms of change. In all his actions, he avoids overindulgence. He knows that excess leads to extremity, extravagance leads to greed, and excessiveness leads to arrogance. Extremity will inevitably reverse, greed will inevitably breed resentment, and arrogance will inevitably invite sorrow. If any of these take root, ruin will follow—thus, he rejects them all.

Those who cultivate the Dao understand the folly of clinging, recognize the harm of extravagance and excess, and through humility and restraint, preserve their inner emptiness. Thus, they may attain the True.

**The Broad Explication of the *Dao De Jing* by Master Guangcheng of Tang, as recorded by Du Guangting**
*(Volume 25)*

「**Chapter Thirty: On Using the Dao to Assist the Sovereign**
Explication:

The preceding chapter illustrates that pride and arrogance lead to loss, hence the rejection of extreme extravagance and self-satisfaction. This chapter warns that military strength and aggressive conquests will inevitably provoke retaliation, making decisive warfare unwise.

It begins by stating that one should use the Dao to admonish the ministers, not rely on military force as an auxiliary. The passage below clarifies that those who love war will surely invite misfortune. Therefore, the virtuous minister employs force only when absolutely necessary.

The section on "fruit of strength" further argues that reliance on military power will inevitably lead to defeat. For the meaning:

The preceding chapter taught the sovereign how to govern by rejecting extravagance and self-satisfaction to become a true ruler. This chapter admonishes ministers to serve the sovereign through **virtue/power (德)** and cultural refinement, rather than through military might. If they cling to arms and valorize warfare, they will inevitably provoke enemies to rise in conflict—this is why it is said that military strength and aggression will provoke retaliation, and such conduct cannot be the basis of governance.

The opening passage directly warns ministers, then explains that wielding arms is not virtuous, as it disrupts agriculture and harms the harvest, leading to years of calamity. Then it concludes with the principle of avoiding force: force, when used, will bring ruin and defeat, and military strength is not the Dao—it should be quickly abandoned.

To use the Dao to assist the sovereign means not to employ military force to dominate the world; such actions will provoke retaliation. Annotation:

For ministers to use the Dao in assisting the sovereign, they must yield with humility and **virtue/power (德)**, not rely on the coercive might of arms to dominate the world. Why? Because arms are instruments of violence, and war is a perilous undertaking. If one provokes another with military threats, the other will surely respond in kind. Since such actions invite retaliation, the outcome of victory or defeat cannot be reliably determined.

Explication:
*以 (yǐ)* means *to use*.
*佐 (zuǒ)* means *to assist*.
*还 (huán)* means *retaliation*.

It states that ministers should use the Dao—transformative, non-coercive guidance—to assist the sovereign, thereby achieving a governance akin to that of Yao and Shun. This is called being the sovereign’s **supporting limbs (股肱)**—his feet and hands. The sovereign is the head, and the ministers are his limbs, just as in a single body. How can the Dao of sovereign and minister be neglected?

The *Shu* says: *"The head is clear, the limbs are strong"*—this is the case.

*"Dancing the dry and feathered"* refers to the *Shangshu □ Great Yu’s Discourse* (《尚书□大禹谟》), which states: Shun, recognizing Yu’s merit, appointed him as successor. At that time, the Miao tribes frequently rebelled against the king’s punishment, so Yu was ordered to lead a campaign against them. Thus, he assembled the armies of the feudal lords, swore them to obedience, and marched forth, bearing the mandate to punish crimes.

After thirty days, the Miao tribes defied the command. Yu’s aide, Yi, said: *"Only through **virtue/power (德)** can one move Heaven; nothing is beyond its reach. Sincerity touches the spirits—how much more so with the Miao?"* Yu then withdrew his troops, steadied his ranks, and spread **cultural refinement (文德)**. He performed the *"dry and feathered"* dance at the two stages, and after seventy days, the Miao tribes submitted. The Miao were positioned to the left of Dongting Lake and to the right of Pengli, within the **uncivilized frontier (荒服)**—a region two thousand five hundred *li* distant from the capital. Though summoned, they refused to comply; this passage speaks of pacifying them through **cultural refinement (文德)** and Daoist transformation, rather than force.»

The **dry (干)** follows the path, the **feathered (羽)** conceals—these are the implements held by the dancer.

After withdrawing the troops and steadying the ranks, without resorting to arms, Yu cultivated **virtue/power (文德)**. He performed the **dry-and-feathered dance** between the guest and host stages, suppressing martial affairs, and thus the Miao came to submit. *"Submit (格)"* means to arrive fully.

The *Rites* say: *"Dancing adorns joy."* Grasping the **dry axe (干戚)** and practicing the bowing, rising, bending, and stretching, one’s bearing becomes dignified. Following the measured steps and aligning with the rhythm, the ranks stand straight. The **feathered and dry axe** are the dance implements; bending and stretching, bowing and rising, are its posture; the arranged steps and varying speeds are its formation.

Thus, the Son of Heaven’s **eight ranks (八佾)**—eight men per row, sixty-four in total. The feudal lords have six ranks, great officers four, and commoners two. *"Rank (佾)"* means a row of two. *"He who holds the great symbol"* refers to the thirty-fifth chapter’s words. The **Great Stage (太阶)**—the three stars of the Three Enclosures and the six stars of the Six Symmetries form the six symbols of the Great Stage, rising from **Wenchang** to **Taowei**, governing the Three Excellents. When the ruler and ministers harmonize and laws are balanced, their stars shine brightly, their formations align. If the stars flicker—some dim, some bright, some narrow, some broad, some changing color, some vanishing—these are omens of calamity. If three stars vanish, there will be dynastic revolution and change of sovereignty. When the six stages shine evenly, the realm is at peace.

Now, if ministers rely on military schemes to assist the ruler, unable to use **virtue/power (文德)** to transform others, they invade and seek conquest, bringing war upon them—then they will surely retaliate, and victory or defeat is uncertain. Some may even self-immolate. *"Negative (负)"* means defeat; *"antagonize (抗)"* means to resist with hands; *"disorder (渎)"* means chaos. Where the army encamps, thorns and brambles grow. After a great campaign, there will surely be years of famine.

**Commentary:** Where the military encamps, war harms agriculture. If farming is neglected, thorns and brambles arise. Military **qi (兵气)** brings harm. Drought and flood follow. Agriculture fails first, and disaster follows—thus, years of famine will surely come as retribution for exhausting the military.

**Explanation:** *"Military (师)"* means the army. As the *Yijing* says: *"Military"* means multitude. When armies are raised and multitudes mobilized, people toil in service. Those who fast and march, or lodge and transport supplies, disrupt labor and harm farming. If agriculture is neglected, thorns and brambles grow. After a great campaign, accumulated expenditures are vast. Harmonious **qi (和气)** brings auspicious signs, but military **qi (兵气)** invites disaster. Drought and flood follow, crops fail, and thus years of famine arise as retribution for exhausting the military.

**Doctrine:** Ministers who use arms to assist the ruler will cause the ruler to rely on them. If the ruler covets unnecessary conquests and ministers seek boundless rewards, some may bully lesser states and invade neighboring territories. Once war is unleashed, the people suffer. Marching soldiers endure hunger; those at home bear the burden of transport. Men abandon farming, women neglect weaving—thus, *"a suspended army of ten thousand costs a thousand gold daily; the looms stand idle, the carts never cease, fields grow over with thorns, and famine follows."* Even without drought or flood, there is already the loss of tillage. Harmonious **qi (和气)** brings blessings; military **qi (兵气)** brings calamity. Epidemics and flight arise from this. The evils of exhausting the military—who can fully speak of them? Only rulers and ministers should deeply take heed.

Those who cultivate the self, if their desires encroach upon one another, are like a state with arms. **True qi (真气)** dissipates, just as the people are exhausted. Thus, if pleasures are unchecked, the spirit **qi (神气)** scatters and fades; when **qi** fades, diseases arise. If **qi** is lost and illness takes hold, what good fortune from virtue can be hoped for? What extension of life can be sought? For the state and for the self, this is deeply to be warned against.

Thus, the virtuous achieve their ends without arrogance. **Commentary:** The *Spring and Autumn Annals* says, *"Killing the enemy is called ‘achieving (果)’."* Now, if one clearly understands that killing the enemy is to stop them, to halt their violence, then one knows that *"killing the enemy"* is the same as *"stopping the enemy."* Laozi said: *"If war cannot be avoided, then the best use of arms is to stop the enemy, ensuring they do not become raiders. One must not use many to overpower few or bully others for strength."* To seek strength leads to repulsion—thus, one must be cautious and not dare to do so.

**Doctrine:** The sovereign transforms the people through **Dao and virtue (道德)**. If **Dao and virtue** are not yet widespread and trust is not yet established, and if external enemies invade, then war may be unavoidable. But responding to crises and subduing the enemy—does this lie in killing? If victory can be won through strategy, then one may hope to stop killing. Thus, the *Classic of Rites* says: *"Stopping the blade is martial."* It is enough to stop the enemy; killing is not required. This is truly *"stopping the blade."*

But if corpses are left unburied, blood flows, and blades clash—sometimes victorious in the front, sometimes defeated in the rear—then retaliation follows, and this is not true martial prowess. One does not dare to seek strength, and thus aligns with the **Dao (天道)**.

*"Killing the enemy is achieving"*—as in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, **Spring of the Second Year of Duke Zhuang**: The Duke of Zheng’s son, **Gui Sheng**, received a command from Chu to attack Song. **Hua Yuan** of Song led the defense, and battle was fought at **Da Ji**. The Song army was defeated, **Hua Yuan** was captured, **Le Ju**, the Minister of Works, was taken, along with four hundred and sixty armored chariots and two hundred and fifty captives. A hundred were mutilated. The Song ministers, **Kuang Jiao**, resisted the Zheng forces, who threw them into a well and pulled them out by their spears, capturing **Kuang Jiao**.

The **Junzi** said: *"They violated rites and commands—thus, they were rightly captured."* The martial spirit must be resolute and decisive in listening to orders. Always keep this in mind, let it take root in the heart, and imagine hearing its commands. *"Killing the enemy is achieving; achieving decisively is called ‘resolute (毅)’."* If reversed, it becomes *"slaughter (戮)."* One achieves without boasting, achieves without arrogance, achieves without pride.

The **Junzi** notes: *"The virtuous assistant who aids a ruler must decisively halt the enemy, yet his focus lies in calming the people and harmonizing the multitude, never daring to seek victory or force. Thus, though resolute in stopping the enemy, he must not act as a raider. He must be cautious not to boast of achievements or claim glory, lest he invite arrogance and overweening pride. Arrogance leads to ruin—this is a profound warning.*

The **Shu** says: *"The art of warfare lies in decisively halting the enemy. If one halts the enemy while boasting of it, this is not true virtue over them. Though capable of halting the enemy, one must guard against boasting. Boasting risks harming the pursuit of merit, so even when decisively stopping the enemy, one must be warned against claiming its glory. Claiming glory is itself arrogance and overweening pride. Arrogance and pride breed a love for killing—thus, defeat follows swiftly, and this is a stern warning. How can one not be cautious?"*

**Yi** explains: *"Boast (矜) means to exaggerate one’s deeds. Claim (伐) means to assert one’s own virtue as unmatched. Arrogance (憍) is contempt. The passage on calming the people and harmonizing the multitude is from the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Year 12 of Duke Xuan: The Chu ruler besieged Zheng. In the third month, he conquered it. The Zheng lord, bare-chested and leading a sheep, went to meet him. The Chu ruler intended to spare him, but his attendants said: ‘We cannot grant this—once a state is taken, there is no mercy.’ The Chu ruler replied: ‘His lord can humble himself before others; surely he can trust and use his people.’ He withdrew thirty *li* and granted peace to Zheng. Pan Jia entered the alliance, and Zi Liang went as a hostage. In the sixth month of summer, the Jin forces came to Zheng’s aid. Gu Lin commanded the central army, with Xian Gu as his assistant, and Zhao Xiao and Zhao Ying as his ministers. Shi Hui led the upper army, with Jing Ke as his assistant, and Gong Shu and Han Chuan as his ministers. Zhao Shu commanded the lower army, with Yue Shu as his assistant, and Guou Chu and Zhao Tong as his ministers. Han Yue was the General of War. They reached the River."*

「When it was heard that Zheng and Chu had made peace, Gu Lin wished to return, saying: *“Why should we attack the people of Zheng after we have already made peace? What use would that be?”*

Chu’s withdrawal would be swift, and they would not delay.

Shi Hui said: *“Excellent.”*

Hui heard that armies advance only after observing favorable omens, that their **virtue/power** and punishments, governance and affairs, and rituals remain unaltered—such a force cannot be defeated. He would not call this recklessness#1.

The Chu ruler attacked Zheng, angered by its **duplicity**#5 but pitying its **humility**#6. To punish it after rebellion was **just punishment**; to grant it peace after submission was **virtue**. Both were established.

In the past, when they invaded Chen, and now when they invade Zheng, the people are not weary, and the ruler harbors no resentment. Their governance has its principles. Chu’s **army formations**#7 are well-ordered.

When they march, the right chariot wheels advance, the left follow their **camp beds**#8, and the **front scouts**#9 are without fault. The center holds balance, the rear provides strength. The hundred officials move in accordance with their duties, and the military is prepared without warning.

They are able to uphold these principles. When the ruler selects leaders, he chooses **inner clansmen** from among his kin, and **outer clansmen** from among the old nobility. Promotions do not lose **virtue**, rewards do not fail to honor **labor**, the aged receive additional benefits, and the common people are given provisions. The **gentleman and commoner** each have their proper distinctions, the **noble** their fixed honors, and the **lowly** their due authority. The rituals are not inverted.

With **virtue** established and punishments enforced, governance complete and affairs timely, principles following rituals in order—how could such a force be resisted? To advance when opportunity presents itself and retreat when danger looms is the finest military governance. To **aid the weak and attack the blind**#10 is the finest strategy of martial virtue.

Zi Liang#11, you should instead focus on disciplining the army and upholding martial strategy.

Xian Gu said: *“It cannot be done.”*

The reason Jin has dominated is because its **General of War**#12 is **upright**, and its ministers are **powerful**. Now, Jin has lost the allegiance of its vassals—this cannot be called **power**. It has enemies it does not follow—this cannot be called **martial virtue**. If we fail to dominate, it would be better to die.

Moreover, we have already assembled the army to advance. If we hear of an enemy and retreat, that would not be a failure. But to be appointed as the army’s commander and yet retreat due to what is not a failure—only the **noble sons**#13 could do that. I will not.

Let me instead assist Gu Lin with the central army.

Guou Chu said: *“This commander is indeed reckless.”*
The *Book of Changes*#14 states: *“When an army advances with strict discipline, it prospers; when it does not, it perishes, and disaster follows.”* Obedience brings prosperity; disobedience brings ruin. If a commander is not followed, who will he face in battle? If he encounters them, he will certainly be defeated. Xian Gu will die in battle, and even if he escapes and returns, he will surely suffer great blame.

Thus, Gu Lin and Han Yue led the army and crossed the river.

The Chu forces marched north and encamped at **Ran**#15. Upon hearing that the Jin army had crossed, the Chu ruler wished to retreat. The Chu minister **Wu Can**#16 urged battle, but the **Prime Minister**#17, **Shu Ao**#18, said it was not possible.

Can replied: *“If our campaign is swift, then Sun Shu will be called without strategy.”*

The Prime Minister reversed the chariots and turned the flags, while Wu Can spoke to the Chu ruler: *“The officers of Jin’s army are new and have not yet learned to follow orders. Their assistant, Xian Gu, is stubborn and unkind, unwilling to obey commands. Their two other commanders#4, acting on their own, will not gain the people’s support—who will they follow? This march will lead to Jin’s defeat. Moreover, if you flee while your subjects fight, how will this affect the state’s **sacred altars and ancestral spirits**#19?”*

The ruler was troubled by this and instructed the Prime Minister to change the chariot direction and march north, encamping at **Guan**#20 to await them.

The Jin commanders **En** and **Hao**#21 were between **Zuo** and **Jing**#22 when the Zheng envoy **Huang**#23 was sent to the Jin army. He said: *“Zheng’s allegiance to Chu is for the sake of the state’s **sacred altars and ancestral spirits**#19—it has no **duplicity**. The Chu army, having won quickly, grew arrogant, and its soldiers are weary yet unprepared. I will strike them, and the Zheng army will take their place. The Chu army will surely be defeated.”*

Xian Gu said: *“Defeating Chu and submitting Zheng is certain. We must allow it.”*

Yue Shu said: *“Since the Chu ruler conquered **Yong**#24, he has never stopped punishing his people, teaching them that life is difficult and that disaster may strike at any moment. He keeps them in constant fear. In the army, he never ceases to inspect supplies and reinforce vigilance. Life depends on diligence—if they are diligent, they will not lack. They cannot be called arrogant. The *Book of Changes* also says: ‘An army that is **upright** is strong; an army that is **crooked** is weary.’ We are not **virtuous**, yet we provoke resentment in Chu. We are **crooked**; they are **upright**—we cannot prevail. If we prevail, it will be through **fortuitous circumstances**#25.”

Following **Zuo**’s words, the Chu ruler sent **Wei Xie**#26 as an envoy to Jin, requesting battle and then returning. **Zhao Zhan**#27 urged entry into Chu to summon the two allied commanders, all desiring Jin’s defeat.

The Chu **Minister of War**#28, **Bo Yi**#29, addressed **Le Bu**#30: *“Our young ruler has suffered misfortune and cannot yet govern with refinement. This expedition, he says, is meant to discipline Zheng and establish order—how dare he seek retribution against Jin? You three should not delay.”*

**Yue Shu**#31 replied: *“In the past, King Ping of Zhou commanded our ancestor, Duke Wen of Jin, saying: ‘Assist Zheng in jointly supporting the Zhou dynasty—do not neglect the royal mandate.’ Now Zheng does not comply, and our ruler sends his ministers to question Zheng. How dare he insult the vassals? We dare to accept the ruler’s command and its humiliation. Xian Gu considers this flattery and orders Zhao Biao to follow and correct him.”*

Zhao Biao said: *“The envoy has lost his words.”*
*“Our ruler commands his ministers to move the great state’s **footsteps**#32 onto Zheng, saying: ‘Do not avoid the enemy.’ The ministers have nowhere to flee for their lives.”*

The Chu ruler again sought terms with Jin, and the Jin people agreed, setting a date for the alliance. Chu granted **Bo Yi**#29 command over **Le Bu**#30, **Shu Ao**#18 as his second-in-command, to govern the Jin army.

**Wei Xie**#26 of Jin was sent to Chu, requesting battle and then returning. Zhao Zhan urged entry into Chu to summon the two allied commanders, all desiring Jin’s defeat.»

The **Zhao Ke** said: *“The two regrets have departed, and without defenses, we shall surely be defeated. Xian Gu replied: ‘The people of Zheng urge us to fight; we dare not comply. The Chu people seek terms, yet we cannot favor them. The army lacks a clear mandate; why prepare defenses?’*

**Shi Hui** said: *“The defenses are well-prepared.”*
*“If the two allied commanders grow angry with Chu, the Chu people will exploit us, and our defeat will be swift. If Chu harbors no ill will, we should remove the defenses and renew the alliance.”*
Xian Gu refused.

Shi Hui sent **Gong Shuo** and **Han Chuan** to lead seven chariots against the enemy at **En** before, so the upper army remained undefeated.

**Zhao Yingzi** assembled boats at the **River**.

**Pan Dang** drove **Wei Xie** out, and the Chu ruler rode his left chariot to pursue **Zhao You**.

The Jin army deployed blunt-wheeled chariots to counter the two allied commanders.

The Chu forces feared the ruler’s entry into the Jin army, so they withdrew from the battle line.

**Sun Shu** said: *“Advance!”*
*“Better that we thin their ranks than that they thin ours.”*
The chariots sped forward, the soldiers fled, and they pressed into the Jin army.

**Lin Fu** was uncertain of what to do, so he beat the drums in the army, declaring: *“Whoever crosses first shall be rewarded.”*
The central and lower armies rushed to seize the boats, and the soldiers on the boats could be scooped up by handfuls.

The Jin army shifted rightward, while the upper army remained unmoving.

**Gong Yin Qi** led the right flank to repel and drive back the lower army.

**Pan Dang** and **Tang Hou** followed the upper army.

Zhao Ke wished to wait for them, but **Shi Hui** said: *“The Chu army is now strong; if they gather against us, we shall be exhausted. Better to rally and withdraw them.”*
He then ordered his troops to retreat, and they were not defeated.

As night fell, the Chu army encamped at **Zhi**. The Jin remnant forces could not fight, so they forded the river at night, yet their movements were still heard.

**Pan Dang** said: *“My lord, why not fortify the Wu Army and collect the Jin dead, displaying them as a warning to the capital?”*
*“I have heard that conquering an enemy must be shown to one’s descendants, lest the martial achievements be forgotten.”*
The Chu ruler said: *“You do not understand.”*
*“The Way of Culture is to halt the sword and make it a symbol of martial might. King Wu conquered Shang and composed the *Song* (Ode of Victory), saying: ‘Sheathe the spears and axes, store the bows and arrows. I seek virtuous power, and now I rule the Xia. The worthy ruler preserves it.’ He also composed the *Wu* (Martial Ode), whose final stanza reads: ‘May your descendants remember your deeds.’ Its third stanza says: ‘Spread the Way and refine thoughts; my purpose is to secure stability.’ Its sixth stanza says: ‘Pacify all lands, and bring abundant harvests.’*
*Martial might* is the power to curb violence, sheathe weapons, uphold the great, establish deeds, secure the people, harmonize the crowds, and enrich the treasury. Thus, it must be shown to descendants that they not forget its principles.

*Now* I have made the bones of the two states a spectacle—*that* is enough. Displaying the army to awe the feudal lords only stirs unrest among the soldiers. To make a spectacle without sheathing the weapons—how can I uphold the great? As long as Jin remains, how can I establish lasting deeds? The grievances of the people are still many; how can they be secure? Without virtue, yet striving to dominate the feudal lords—how can I harmonize the crowds? Seizing others’ opportunities while sowing chaos for their own glory—how can I enrich the treasury? *Martial might* has seven virtues; I possess none of them—how can I demonstrate them to my descendants?

*This* is merely the ancestral temple’s purpose: to proclaim the completion of the task. *Martial might* is not my achievement.”

The ancient sage-kings punished the disrespectful, seizing their tyrants and enshrining them as warnings—thus arose the *jingguan* [京观] to deter licentiousness and depravity. Today, there is no crime, yet the people exhaust their loyalty in dying for their lord’s command—how then could this be made into a *jingguan*?

Sacrificing at the River, constructing the ancestral temple, and proclaiming the task complete before returning.

In this campaign, the Duke of Zheng executed Stone Zhi and established Prince Yu Chen as heir. On the day *xinwei*, Zheng put Stone Zhi and Yu Chen to death.

The virtuous say: *"Do not complacently invite chaos"*—this refers to such cases.

To strike preemptively and achieve victory, to halt aggression and rescue the endangered—this is indeed virtuous. But if one boasts of one’s own merits and flaunts one’s achievements, indulging in fame while harboring arrogance, then *qiangtai* [憍泰] arises. *Qiangtai* dulls one’s perception, and domination breeds resentment. Disaster and ruin are inevitable; fame and merit cannot be preserved.

Han Xin was captured at Yunmeng, Bai Qi’s teeth were shattered at Duwei. Boasting of victory breeds arrogance, and arrogance invites calamity—this must be heeded.

*"Fruitful action"* when unavoidable: this is *fruitful action without coercion*.

**Note:** When the enemy advances and cannot be halted, one must use force to repel them. Thus, *fruitful action* lies in responding to the enemy, not in seeking dominance through force.

**Cushioning Explanation:** Those who act decisively to repel the enemy do not delight in victory or oppress others. The enemy’s advance is unavoidable, hence the necessity of action.

Thus it is said: *"Fruitful action without coercion."* *Yi* [已] means to halt.

When engaging the enemy, one does not seek victory for its own sake—those who act thus *are* victorious. Not relying on brute force, hence *"fruitful action without coercion."*

When things reach their peak, they decline—this is called *not in accord with the Dao*. *Not in accord with the Dao* leads to early ruin.

**Note:** When things rely on their peak strength, it is like an army relying on brute force. When things peak, they decline; when armies rely on strength, they meet defeat. This is called *not in accord with the Dao*—one must halt such actions early.

**Cushioning Explanation:** All things, at their peak, grow old; armies, at their strongest, meet defeat. Thus, an army relying on strength is like a thing relying on its peak—using peak strength only hastens decline and injury. These two cases are called *not in accord with the Dao*. Wise ministers and enlightened rulers, knowing this, must halt such actions early.

Thus it is said: *"Not in accord with the Dao, halt early."* *Yi* [已] means to cease.

**Doctrine states:** Armies that rely on brute force will inevitably meet ruin. The forces of Fu Jian at Leicheng, Li Mi at Luokou, Wang Jin at Kunyang, and Emperor Yang’s expedition to Liaodong—all numbered in the hundreds of thousands, truly vast in number. Yet, relying on *non-Dao* strength, they collapsed without recovery—because their armies were too strong. Just as things peak and then decline, relying on peak strength must bring harm.

In ancient times, Qin devoured the Seven States, unified the Nine Regions, its strength and armies unmatched, yet the empire crumbled in an instant. Fu Su died at the Great Wall, Zi Yin surrendered at Zhidao. What use were their hawk-like ambitions?

The Sage deemed this *non-Dao* foundation—better to halt early.

Cultivating the self, one restrains desires and returns to nature—just as with armies. If one abandons passions, purifies the spirit, and stills delusive thoughts, guarding the void and the mysterious, there will be no censure of peak strength—this is the essence of perfect harmony.

Armies too have their decline. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* says: *"A crooked army is old"*—meaning an army deployed without just cause, acting against principle, its logic defeated by the enemy, is also considered old.

Thus it is said: *"A righteous army is strong; a crooked army is old."*

*Volume Twenty-Six of the Broad Explication of the Daoist Classic.*

The **Thirty-First Chapter on *Jiābīng* (佳兵)**—Explication:

The previous chapter expounds that a strong army prefers to return (in victory), and one must not indulge in its arrogance or conquest. This chapter clarifies that *jiābīng* (佳兵, "good/ideal arms") is an evil thing, to be used only when unavoidable. First, it sets forth warnings against its ominous nature, showing that those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon it. Next, it states that victory does not bring joy, illustrating that delight in killing is wrong. Beneath this, it cites examples to elucidate the point, concluding with the observance of funeral rites—thus demonstrating that war is not something to be rejoiced in.

Its meaning is this: First, it admonishes ministers that they should assist the state with the Dao, not with arms. Now it reveals that *jiābīng* (佳兵) is indeed an ominous implement. If one relies on arms to aid the state, it will inevitably lead to arrogance and conquest; if one indulges in arrogance and conquest, it will inevitably result in defeat and ruin. Therefore, it directly points to *jiābīng* (佳兵) as the thing that all detest. When the enemy comes to invade, one must use it only when there is no alternative. Those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon such things, nor do they take pleasure in victory over the enemy, but rather prioritize righteous killing. This is a warning against taking delight in killing. The observance of funeral rites in its place is not because one desires war.

**The ideal arms (佳兵),** indeed, are an ominous implement.
—Explication: *Jiā* (佳) means "good/ideal." Arms are of the category of *tāoliè* (韬略). *Xiáng* (祥) means "auspicious/good," and *qì* (器) refers to implements or talents. The virtuous person cultivates virtue and perfects their pursuits, ever cautious at the outset. They keep their implements hidden within, awaiting the moment to act. They should roam their thoughts within the Daoist *yòu* (囿, "enclosure"), browsing the wisdom of ancient edicts and classics, so that their light shines forth through the ages, and their guidance aids in great undertakings.

Its meaning is this: *Tāo* (韬) refers to the *Liùtāo* (六韬, "Six Stratagems"). **Qí Tàigōng Jiāng Zǐyá** (齐太公姜子牙), while fishing at the **Pánxī** (磻溪), split an fish and found a jade, within which was inscribed this book. It is called *Wéntāo* (文韬, "Civil Stratagem"), establishing the state and nation without transgressing Heaven’s order; *Wǔtāo* (武韬, "Martial Stratagem"), subduing calamities and chaos, dominating the eight directions; *Lóngtāo* (龙韬, "Dragon Stratagem"), harmonizing yin and yang, never exceeding the seasons; *Hǔtāo* (虎韬, "Tiger Stratagem"), skillfully employing claws and fangs, crushing all evil; *Bàotāo* (豹韬, "Leopard Stratagem"), seizing the moment to quell difficulties, with wisdom lying in adaptability; *Quǎntāo* (犬韬, "Dog Stratagem"), discerning the faintest sounds, sometimes achieving unexpected success.

*Tāo* (韬) means "to conceal." The stratagems and adaptations of arms are not to be lightly revealed to others. Hence, the meaning is to conceal and obscure them.

*Liè* (略) refers to the *Sānliè* (三略, "Three Strategies"). The *Sānliè* (三略) is what **Hàn Liúhóu Zhāng Zǐfáng** (汉留侯张子房) received in **Xiàpí Yíqiáoliáo** (下邳圯桥) from **Huángshí Gōng** (黄石公), who taught him: "With this, you may become a teacher to emperors and kings, or a master of the arts of stratagem and warfare." **Jiāng Zǐyá** (姜子牙) used it to assist **Wǔwáng** (武王), conquering **Shāng** (商) and overthrowing **Jiǔ** (纣), thus completing the royal enterprise. **Zhāng Zǐfáng** (张子房) used it to assist **Hàn Zǔ** (汉祖), annihilating **Xiàng Jié** (项籍) and securing the imperial ambition.

The cultivation of **virtue/power** (德) is such that one’s **virtue/power** (德) surpasses the Five Emperors, becoming the finest of moral conduct. The pursuit of learning encompasses the Six Arts, marking the foremost of scholarly endeavors.

Thus, the virtuous person attends to fundamentals—when the foundation is established, the *Dao/Way* arises. In the pursuit of learning, one must be cautious from the very beginning.

To study Confucian texts, morality, and the *Dao/Way* is to become a **junzi** (君子); to study greed, arrogance, cruelty, and violence is to become a petty person.

In days past, **Mèng Kē** (孟轲), when young and orphaned, lived near a burial ground and began practicing funeral rites. His mother, a virtuous woman, saw that his studies were not noble and relocated, moving near a potter’s home. There, **Mèng Kē** learned to shape clay vessels, so his mother moved again, this time near a school of Confucian scholars. Then **Mèng Kē** studied the classics and ancient texts, later becoming a great scholar, his *Dao/Way* rivaling that of **Zhōu Kǒng** (周孔), his reputation surpassing that of **Hàn Fēi** (韩非) and **Mò Dì** (墨翟).

In his youth, **Kǒng Zǐ** (孔子) had an elder brother who delighted in playing with ritual food vessels. Later, he became the founder of rites and music, his *Dao/Way* surpassing all sovereigns, his teachings harmonizing the Four Seas.

When **Hòuxī** (后稷) was a child, he took pleasure in imitating plowing and farming. Later, he became the master of agriculture, spreading cultivation and nourishing the people, his merits benefiting all under heaven.

When **Hàn Zhāng Táng** (汉张汤) was a boy, he witnessed a mouse stealing meat and was scolded by his father. **Zhāng Táng** smoked out the mouse, along with the remaining meat, flogged the mouse, and interrogated it as if it were a criminal, extracting a confession and recording its "testimony" like an experienced jailer. Later, he served the **Hàn** (汉) as a legal official, meticulously codifying laws and establishing enduring statutes.

Thus, those who cultivate good habits reap their rewards. The key lies in being vigilant from the very beginning—**guì** (厥), meaning "its" or "their"; **chū** (初), meaning "beginning."

「The one who keeps **virtue/power** (器) within himself, as the *Yì* ["**I Ching**"] (《易□下系》) says: *"The noble lord used his bow and arrows to shoot a falcon atop a high wall, and when he captured it, there was no failure."* The Master said: *"The falcon is a bird; the bow and arrows are **virtue/power** (器); the one who shoots is a man. The gentleman keeps **virtue/power** (器) within himself, waits for the right time, and then acts—how could there be any failure?"* This means that when the gentleman finds the right time, he will succeed; if he does not find the right time, his actions may lead to misfortune, and thus he will have no success.

The annotation explains that *"the noble lord"* refers to **impartiality** (无私), *"high wall"* symbolizes **high position** (高位). The falcon on the high wall is difficult to shoot, just as a man in a high position is difficult to remove. If one in a high position is greedy and cruel like the falcon, those who seek to remove him will succeed without fail when they find the right time. This also means that the gentleman with great **virtue/power** (德) and lasting achievements should act only when the time is right.

The *Shǐ Jì* ["**Records of the Grand Historian**"] states: *"When the gentleman finds the right time, he ascends to power; if he does not find the right time, he travels with humility."* As it says: *"When the state follows the **Dao/Way** (道), one speaks and acts with boldness; when the state does not follow the **Dao/Way** (道), one acts with caution and speaks with humility."* Finding the right time leads to success benefiting all under heaven; losing the right time means one can only cultivate oneself. This is how one discerns the proper course of action.

One’s mind should dwell in **moral cultivation** (道德), and one’s thoughts should range through **classical texts and ancient records** (典坟). **囿** (囿) means **enclosure/retreat** (园囿); **典** (典) refers to **sacred archives** (谟典); **坟** (坟) means the books of the **Three Sovereigns** (三皇之书), known as the **Three Canon** (三坟). **诰** (诰) means **edicts** (训语), such as the examples in *Táng Guāng* ["**The Edict of Tang**"] and *Jiǔ Guāng* ["**The Edict on Alcohol**"]. **林** (林) means **abundant writings** (丛木为林), speaking of the vastness of **history and literature** (书史). **光** (光) means **great** (大); **昭** (昭) means **clear** (明); **令** (令) means **good** (善). Thus, **"great and clear good reputation"** (大明善美之名) refers to fame that is both illustrious and virtuous.

As for **opening the way and achieving great undertakings** (开济成务), the *Yì* ["**I Ching**"] (《易□上系》) says: *"The **I Ching** opens the way and achieves great undertakings, for it is the **Dao/Way** of all under heaven."* This means that the **Dao/Way** of the *I Ching* can be applied universally—just as the **Dao/Way** of all under heaven opens the way and achieves great undertakings, so too the gentleman’s **virtue/power** (德业) shines brightly and clearly, serving as a model for the world. Only then can one dwell in the **enclosure/retreat** of **moral cultivation** (道德之园囿) and wander through the **abundant writings** of **classical texts and ancient records** (坟诰之丛林), with a good reputation spreading far and wide, fulfilling great purposes.

In the *Chūn Qiū* ["**Spring and Autumn Annals**"], **Sòng Mù Gōng** (宋穆公) said to his minister when appointing **Zhāng Dìng Gōng** (立殇公) as heir: *"My predecessor considered me capable and virtuous. My fame is great, clear, and good—this is it."* Those who cultivate the **Dao/Way** (修道之士) should also be cautious in their habits, dwelling in the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) and contemplating **non-action** (无为). Only then can they hope to attain the **Dao/Way**.

If one lingers in the realm of **right and wrong** (是非), binds himself to the ruins of **ritual teachings** (言教), wanders lost in the **path of indulgence** (嗜玩), or peeks through the **window of frivolity** (浮诞), his **Dao/Way** will only grow more distant.

When the ruler governs his state by following the **sacred traditions of the Yellow Emperor and the **Dao/Way** of the ancient kings** (皇风帝道), he can achieve **peace and prosperity** (升平). But if he emulates the **achievements of kings and schemes of conquerors** (王业霸图), he rarely attains **tranquility and purity** (清静). What then of **martial arts and strategies of war** (兵战之术)? These are what one should guard against.

The annotation says: *"Yet there are those who take delight in **military strategies and schemes of war** (兵谋韬略)."* The purpose of such schemes is to use **rectitude** (正) as **deceit** (奇), and the books of **warfare** (兵铃) emphasize **bluffing before striking** (先声后实), all centered on **attacking, seizing, slaughtering, and punishing** (攻取杀伐). Thus, they are **unauspicious tools of evil** (不善之村器).

The commentary explains: *"**谋** (谋) means **planning and calculating** (图度); **奇** (奇) means **deceit and trickery** (变诈); **攻** (攻) means **to strike** (击); **取** (取) refers to **ease of acquisition** (其易)."* The books of the *Liù Táo* ["**Six Tactics**"] and *Sān Lüè* ["**Three Strategies**"], as well as the **strategies inscribed on metal and jade** (金版玉铃之术), all focus on **planning and calculating** (机谋), not on **auspicious and virtuous methods** (祥善之道). Since **warfare values deceit**, it relies on **rectitude as deceit**, **striking with false pretense**, and **expanding treacherous schemes** (开张诡谲)—these are not what the gentleman should follow.

In the state, such **schemes lead to greed and cruelty** (贪残); in one’s own life, they result in **evil actions** (不善); toward others, they bring **hatred and malice** (憎恶). How could they be practiced or followed? Moreover, what one cultivates should ultimately lead to **success** (有成). When one’s undertakings are successful, he applies them; when he applies them, he seeks **fulfillment** (求达). Those who cultivate **auspicious tools** (善器) advance to benefit others, retreat to preserve themselves, act to achieve great merits, and shine to display their **virtue/power** (德). But those who cultivate **martial arts**, take **deceit and trickery** as their foundation, **deception** as their skill, **slaughter and conquest** as their merit, and **punishment and warfare** as their purpose—these lead to **lack of sincerity** (非信) and **lack of benevolence** (非仁). In the state, they make the ruler the **master of conquest and war** (征伐之主); in one’s own life, they lead to **becoming a deceitful trickster** (诡妄之徒). Such matters are clearly evil.

When **Lǎo Jun** ["**Old Master** (老子/Laozi)"] spoke of the **scriptures** (经), he only mentioned **combat and warfare** (战斗), which were the **strategies of the battles of Bān Quán, Zháo Lù, and Dān Pǔ** (版泉涿鹿、丹浦). At that time, there were no books like the *Liù Táo* ["**Six Tactics**"] and *Sān Lüè* ["**Three Strategies**"]. Yet even in **warfare**, the emphasis was on **seizing the right moment** (机讨) and **using deceit to undermine** (谲诈相倾), with **victory** as merit and **slaughter** as beauty—these are not the pursuits of those who follow the **Dao/Way**. Therefore, one must strictly guard against them.

Now, I cite the books of *Liù Táo* ["**Six Tactics**"] and *Sān Lüè* ["**Three Strategies**"] to illustrate the **near** (近) with the **far** (远). All things may **hate** (恶) it, so even those who follow the **Dao/Way** avoid it. The annotation explains: *"To take delight in **military strategies and schemes of war** (兵谋韬略) is to cultivate **unauspicious tools** (不祥之器). Since all things **hate** (恶) it, how could those who follow the **Dao/Way** (有道) place themselves within it?"* The commentary states: *"The gentleman who follows the **Dao/Way** (有道之士) nourishes **virtue/power** (德) within himself—this is what constitutes **true success** (能事). Since these are **unauspicious tools** (不祥之器), all things **hate** (恶) them. How much more would the gentleman who follows the **Dao/Way** avoid placing himself within such matters!"*

It further says: *"The gentleman who follows the **Dao/Way** (有道之士) cultivates **sincerity** (德) within himself, uses **goodness** (善) to save others, acts with **simplicity and rectitude** (动资简正), and remains **in harmony with emptiness** (静合虚无), never harboring thoughts of **slaughter and punishment** (杀伐). How could he take delight in **martial schemes** (兵谋)?"* **Warfare** is rooted in **slaughter and punishment** (杀伐), and all things **hate** (恶) it.

Those who cultivate **sincerity and proper speech** (修辞立诚) are like the words of the **乾九三** (乾九三) passage in the *Yì* ["**I Ching**"]. The gentleman is **loyal and trustworthy** (忠信)—this is how he cultivates **virtue/power** (德). He establishes **sincerity** (诚) in his undertakings—this is how he **dwells in his station** (居业). The gentleman values **the left** (阳) in dwelling, but **the right** (右) in **martial arts**. The annotation explains: *"**左** (左) means **yang** (阳)."*

「The **Dao/Way** of **yang** (阳) brings forth growth and flourishing, hence why **the left** (阳) is prized in peaceful dwelling. **The right** (右), being **yin** (阴), congeals into solemnity and slaughter, thus why it is prized in warfare. The annotation elucidates: *"**The left** (左) is **yang** (阳). **The right** (右) is **yin** (阴). **Yang** favors growth, **yin** favors slaughter; hence, **yang** is prized in dwelling for its nurturing, while **yin** is prized in warfare for its slaying."*

The **I Ching** explains: *"The Emperor emerges from **Zhèn** (震, Thunder), and all things are born in the east. Spring governs growth, summer nurtures to maturity. The **Dao/Way** of Heaven revolves to the left, thus **the left** (阳) aligns with **yang**, harmonizing with the **Dao/Way** of growth and flourishing. All things turn solemn and slaying in the west, autumn governing slaughter. They retreat and conceal in the north, winter governing concealment. The moon corresponds to **yin** (阴) and presides over punishment, while metal abides in the west and presides over warfare—thus **the right** (阴) aligns with **yin**, countering the **Dao/Way** of slaughter and punishment. The gentleman embodies **ren** (仁, benevolence) to benefit all things, hence why **yang** (the left) is prized in dwelling. In warfare, he upholds **yì** (义, righteousness) and values **criminal punishment** (刑), thus why **yin** (the right) is prized."*

Warfare is an **auspicious** (祥) yet **ominous** (不祥) instrument. The annotation clarifies: *"**Auspicious** (祥) means **good** (善)."* Those who delight in warfare favor slaughter, hence they are **unvirtuous** (不善) material. It is not the instrument of the gentleman. The annotation further explains: *"The gentleman values **moral cultivation and virtue/power** (道德) as his instrument, not martial schemes."*

The preceding passage stated: *"The ideal warrior is an **auspicious** (祥) yet **ominous** (不祥) instrument,"* thus clarifying that warfare prizing **yin** (the right) and favoring slaughter means the gentleman does not engage in it. This passage reiterates: *"Warfare is an **ominous** (不祥) instrument,"* reinforcing the prior text, declaring it not the gentleman’s tool. The gentleman’s instrument is **moral cultivation and virtue/power** (道德), hence he finds no benefit therein.

The **I Ching** explains: *"What the gentleman cultivates are the **virtues/powers** (德) of the **Thirteen Sovereigns and Five Emperors** (十三皇五帝), tracing the **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义) of the **Táng Yú, Xià Yīn, and Shǒu** (唐虞夏殷) dynasties, and establishing the **rites and music** (礼乐) of **Dà Wén, Dà Wǔ, Zhōu, and Kǒng** (文武周孔). He seeks to govern the world, benefit all things, guide future kings, and bless generations to come. When the times favor him, he opens the **Dao/Way** to nurture and complete undertakings; when the times do not, he withdraws and cherishes them within."*

Thus, there is nothing that cannot be beneficial.

The preceding passage states that *"a fine weapon is an ominous instrument"*, and that those who follow the **Dao/Way** do not engage with it. It now illustrates the initial focus of what the gentleman cultivates: his efforts lie in **virtue/power** (道德), not in military strategy (兵谋). Those who cultivate military strategy are not the gentleman’s true pursuits.

Once military strategy is mastered, it must inevitably be applied. The purpose of wielding arms is made clear in the following passage. When compelled to use force, the gentleman prioritizes **serenity and moderation** (恬淡).*
**Annotation:** *"Steadfastly subduing without strife"* (善勝不爭) and *"when pressed, then act"* (事不得已，然後應之).

The **Commentary** explains:
*"The **virtues/powers of culture** (文德) are the instruments of governance, while military strategy (兵谋) serves as auxiliary support. Hence it is said that **culture weaves the patterns of heaven and earth** (文則經緯天地), and **military force resolves calamity and disorder** (武則克定禍亂). Though heaven bestows the Five Strategies (五村), abandoning even one is unacceptable, yet the application of military force must be measured and disciplined. Thus, one knows that its use has its foundations and branches, its proper and improper courses, and depends on necessity—then alone may it be employed. When the barbarians (四夷) invade, the royal armies must strike with restraint, demonstrating **kindness and benevolence** (恩惠) and pacifying them through **virtue/power** (道德). Even when repelling minor threats like mosquitoes (蚊蚋), there is no room for anger. From this perspective, **serenity and moderation** (恬淡) are paramount."*

**Annotation:** *"The Sage’s governance and instruction"* (聖人制法垂訓) involve adjusting severity according to the times, like changing a carriage’s wheels or cleaning its axle.

*"The Sovereign of the highest rank transforms through the **Dao/Way** (道), the next through **virtue/power** (德), and the next through **benevolence** (仁). When **virtue/power** (道德) declines, the times grow chaotic, and the **Dao/Way** of **culture and military force** (文武) is then invoked. **Culture** instructs through **rites, music, benevolence, and righteousness** (礼乐仁义); **military force** instructs through **unconventional and orthodox tactics, authority, and strategy** (奇正权谋). **Culture weaves the patterns of heaven and earth** (文經天地), while **military force resolves calamity and disorder** (武定禍亂); **culture is the foundation** (文為本), and **military force is the application** (武為末); **culture is the essence** (文為體), and **military force is the function** (武為用).*

The Master said: *"Not to teach the people war is to abandon them."* Yet there are **cultural affairs** (文事), and there are also **military preparations** (武備). At the **Jiāgǔ Meeting** (夹谷之会), he proclaimed his military readiness and executed the rebellious **Cháng Yóu** (徘优), causing the Duke of Qí (齐侯) to fear him. The Duke returned the land of **Yīn** (阴) and **Tián** (田), and the Master completed the rites before withdrawing, thus demonstrating that **military force is the auxiliary to culture** (武为文之辅), and **culture is the master of military force** (文为武之主).

*"Weaving the patterns of heaven and earth"* (经纬天地) refers to the **south-north axis as the warp** (南北为经), and the **east-west axis as the weft** (东西为纬), probing the **emotions and states of ghosts and spirits** (鬼神之情状), and elucidating the **transformations of creation** (造化之变通). With the **Nine Schools** (九流) maintaining clarity and the **Hundred Methods** (百度) upholding rectitude, the **patterns of humanity** (人文) are observed to transform and civilize the world, hence the title *Wén* (文) was bestowed upon him.*

*"Resolving calamity and disorder"* (克定祸乱) means that **violence and cruelty** (凶暴) harming others are called **calamity** (祸), while **rebellion against virtue and law** (反德律逆) is called **disorder** (乱). To **inflict injury** (得伤) is to **subdue** (克). Thus, the **Yellow Emperor** (黄帝) exterminated **Chī Yóu** (蚩尤), **Shùn** (舜) exterminated the **Three Miáo** (三苗), **Tāng** (汤) overcame **Jié** (桀), the **Zhōu** (周) dynasty overcame **Zhòu** (纣), and **Qín** (秦) annihilated the **Six States** (六国), while the **Hàn** (汉) dynasty pacified the **Three Qín** (三秦). These were acts to **remove violent and harmful governance** (暴害之政) and **sever the roots of rebellion and disorder** (乱逆之根), to **rescue living beings** (拯活生灵), not to kill men for victory’s sake. Hence the title *Wǔ* (武) was bestowed upon him.*

This then clarifies the **foundation and application** (本末), distinguishes the **proper and improper courses** (逆顺), and shows that military force is employed only when absolutely necessary.

When barbarian tribes from the Four Quarters invade, during the reign of **King Xuan** of the **Zhōu**, the **Quán Róng** (犬戎) repeatedly encroached upon the Central States, and armies were dispatched to repel them—hence the *Shī Jīng* (《诗》) speaks of "smiting and slaying the **Róng** (猃狁)."

Heaven generates the Five Phases (五行)—gold, wood, water, fire, and earth. These Five Phases cyclically succeed one another, and the Sage-Kings wield them like tools, hence they are called the **Five Materials** (五材). Their use is interdependent; lacking any one, the system falters.

An army that follows the Sage-King’s mandate is called the **Royal Army** (王师). *Shī* (师) means "multitude." In the *Yì Jīng* (《易》), it is the **Shī** (师) hexagram—**Kūn** (坤) above, **Kǎn** (坎) below.

When an army is dispatched with formal declarations, it is called *fá* (伐); when it does so without such declarations, it is called *qīn* (侵). The Royal Army, when campaigning, first displays martial might to instill awe, then extends benevolence and trust to win their allegiance—not to indulge in wanton slaughter or vent rage through indiscriminate slaughter.

An army deployed with justification is *shùn* (顺); without justification, it is *nì* (逆). Observe the invasions of the Four Quarters: they are like mosquitoes and gnats biting the skin—no great calamity to the Central States, nor does it harm morality. What is proper is to pacify them with kindness and transform them through harmony, without harboring vengeful intent. This is the highest virtue of tranquility.

Thus, it is fitting to resolve conflicts through skillful diplomacy, as **Lúo Nóng** (僚弄丸) did, or to lay down arms in peace, as **Shū Ào** (叔敖) did, achieving victory without battle—this is the supreme way. To celebrate victory without shame is to delight in killing. **Cóng** (疏) explains: *"Unable to win them with virtue, yet resorting to arms for victory, though triumphant, one still feels shame for failing in virtue and should not take pride in it. Victory inevitably entails slaughter; thus, one who takes pride in victory is one who delights in killing."*

**Yì** (义) states: *"The Sage’s gentle subjugation of the Four Quarters, pacifying chaos and disorder, relies on cultural virtue to win their allegiance, transforming them for good—not through warfare. Now, if virtue proves insufficient and one must resort to martial might for victory, yet still rejoices in it, lacking inner shame or compassion, then one truly delights in killing."*

In days past, **Jì Zhá** (季札) observed the *Dà Hù* (《大护》) dance and remarked: *"The Sage’s magnanimity still carries a sense of shame."* **The *Lúnyǔ*** (《论语》) says: *"The martial virtues are indeed beautiful, yet not entirely good."* This refers to conquering the world through arms—hence, not entirely good.

Those who delight in killing cannot achieve their ambitions in the world. **Zhù** (注) elaborates: *"To vanquish an enemy inevitably costs lives, so victory should not be glorified. If one takes pride in victory, it is because they take pleasure in slaughter. Those who take pleasure in slaughter will never find followers. To seek dominance while spurning virtue is indeed difficult."*

**Cóng** (疏) continues: *"Heaven and Earth cherish life; all things nurture and sustain. The virtuous follow Heaven’s will, prioritizing salvation. How could one recklessly wield deceit and force to indulge in cruelty? The cruel will never find allegiance. To seek dominance while spurning virtue is indeed difficult. Thus, those who delight in killing cannot achieve their ambitions in the world."*

**Yì** (义) states: *"The benevolent heart measures responses, aligns with harmony, and nurtures with love. Toward all beings, they harbor pity, unwilling to see any suffer. The *Lǐ* (《礼》) says: 'Seeing them alive, one cannot bear to see them die; hearing their cries, one cannot bear to eat their flesh.' Further, they bury dogs beneath worn-out mats, horses beneath tattered canopies, and oxen beneath broken carts. **Chén Ānshì** (陈安世) refrained from travel in summer to avoid crushing insects, and refrained from cutting grass or trees. If the time for insects to hatch had not yet come, he would not burn the fields. These are all expressions of compassion. To follow Heaven’s nurturing and preserve life—this is the essence of virtue. How could one revel in slaughter for glory or delight in killing for wealth and honor?"*

If one glorifies slaughter and deceitful victory, indulging in cruelty and greed, becoming an object of fear, then who would dare to follow? Without followers, relying only on tyranny, to seek dominance in the world is indeed difficult. The downfalls of **Dōng Hūn** (东昏) and **Chāngyě Gāoyáng** (昌邑高洋) serve as warnings.

Auspicious matters are conducted on the left; inauspicious matters, on the right. **Cóng** (疏) explains: *"Left signifies life and auspice, hence auspicious matters are conducted on the left. Right signifies death and inauspice, hence inauspicious matters are conducted on the right."* The *Lǐjì* (《礼记·檀弓》) records: *"The Master stood with his disciples, clasping his hands and turning to the right. The disciples also turned to the right. The Master said: 'Your eagerness for learning stems from my sister’s recent death.' The disciples then turned to the left."* **Yì** (义) clarifies: *"Left represents Yang, the principle of life, so in daily life, the left is honored. In guest-host relations and clasping hands, the left is superior and respected. Right represents Yin, the principle of death. In funeral rites, the right is honored. When the Master had his sister’s funeral, he clasped his hands and turned to the right. The disciples, unaware of the reason, followed suit. Upon learning their devotion to learning, the Master had them return to the left. *Tán Gōng* (檀弓) is the fourth chapter of the *Lǐjì*."*

**Yán Huí** (颜回), who mastered the Master’s teachings and was ranked first among disciples as the **Yà Shèng** (亚圣), once asked the Master: *"When you speak, I speak; when you argue, I argue; when you remain silent yet are trusted, when you do not compare yet are comprehensive, when you lack tools yet achieve completion—I do not know how this is so."* Gazing at the dust, he sighed in admiration. *"Your disciples’ passion for learning is such, yet still they cannot fully grasp your teachings—how much less can the unlearned?"*

In military ranks, the **Piān Jiāngjūn** (偏将军) stands to the left, while the **Shàng Jiāngjūn** (上将军) stands to the right.

The annotations state:

The **Piān Jiāngjūn** (偏将军), though of lower rank, stands to the left because he does not hold sole authority over killing. The **Shàng Jiāngjūn** (上将军), of higher rank, stands to the right because he is entrusted with military strategy. This arrangement follows the rites of mourning.

The rites of mourning honor the right, yet the **Shàng Jiāngjūn** occupies the right—this is because the disposition is made according to mourning rites.

The *Cū* (疏) explains: If the **Shàng Jiāngjūn** held sole authority over killing, he would stand to the right; the **Piān Jiāngjūn**, as his deputy without sole authority, stands to the left. Now, though the left is honored and the right is lowly, the **Shàng Jiāngjūn** stands to the right, indicating that the Dao of war aligns with mourning rites. Since mourning rites honor the right, and the **Shàng Jiāngjūn** stands to the right, this is why he is placed accordingly.

The *Yì* (义) states: Mourning rites honor the right, as death belongs to *yin*. The **Shàng Jiāngjūn** holds sole authority over killing, thus overseeing matters of death. When a state sends its army, the **Shàng Jiāngjūn** ascends the platform, the Son of Heaven observes fasting and purification, and grants him the axe and battle-axe—this is to invest him with sole authority over killing. He breaks through the *xué* (凶) gate and departs, signifying his role in matters of death.

Thus it is said: *"War is a cruel instrument,"* and *"War is the arbiter of life and death."* If a general has strategy, the dead may return to life; if he lacks strategy, the living may perish. War is a perilous affair, casting men into death—how is this not akin to mourning rites?

The **Piān Jiāngjūn**, not holding sole authority over killing, occupies a fortunate position to the left. When many are slain, he weeps in sorrow and grief.

The annotation states: *"Because life is precious and war involves conflict, there is compassion for the slain, hence the sorrowful weeping."*

The *Cū* elaborates: *"To seek victory in battle necessitates the slaughter of many. Victory, though achieved, is not praiseworthy, hence the sorrowful weeping."*

For the people are the foundation of the state; if the foundation is secure, the state is at peace. Now, in war, the people are slain, so the compassionate heart feels sorrow, and thus they weep—is this not fitting?

The *Yì* states: *"Those who win through war slaughter many. Moreover, human life—nine heavens divide the qi, ten months nurture the spirit—embracing *yin*, exhaling *yang*, conforming to Heaven and mirroring Earth—among all things, humanity is the most refined. A state’s strength lies in its people, as fish depend on water. Thus the *Shàngshū* [recorded in the *Wǔzǐ zhī gē* (五子之歌)] says: ‘The august ancestor instructed: The people may be approached but not belittled. The people are the foundation of the state; if the foundation is firm, the state is at peace.’ This refers to the time of Tàikāng, who held office without virtue, indulging in unrestrained revelry. Yòu of Yǒuqióng, moved by the people’s suffering, resisted at the Hé River, for his loss of virtue caused the people to abandon him, making the state unstable. Thus, when the people are weak, the state is in peril; when the people unite, the state becomes dominant. Now, if one seeks glory and fame through war, covets land, and slaughters people, driving living souls into death—how can the virtuous and the wise not grieve and mourn?"*

Thus the following passage states: *"When armies clash, the one who weeps in sorrow shall prevail."* Weeping is grief.

Victory in war is treated with mourning rites.

The annotation states: *"Brave and heroic warriors, upon achieving victory, receive titles and stand in the honored right position. Though the right is not a fortunate position, it is treated with mourning rites, as war is an ominous instrument—why must it be marked with mourning attire?"*

The *Cū* explains: *"When a warrior wins through battle, he receives a title, and martial prowess is placed to the right—a position that is not fortunate. Hence it is said that it is treated with mourning rites, but war is merely an ominous instrument. Why must one don mourning garments and lean on a staff to truly call it mourning rites?"* Those who recorded this meaning all claimed such rites existed in antiquity, but upon examining ancient texts, there is no evidence. Thus, this is not recorded.

It further cites the example of *Qín Bó* (秦伯) weeping before his troops—this was grief over defeat, not victory in war.

The *Yì* states: *"Those who win and receive titles hold high rank as **Shàng Jiāngjūn**, also treated with mourning rites. War is an instrument of ill intent, and battle is the means of slaughter. Victory means killing the enemy; defeat means killing one’s own—both are the people."*

The Sage does not grieve without pain. The **Saint** takes this to be sorrowful, the **Noble** takes it to be compassionate—thus it should be treated with mourning rites. The **sāo-zhàng** (hempen mourning garments and staff) are mourning attire. But why must one grieve and pity only when donning such garments? Some claim that in antiquity, when armies marched forth, the **Son of Heaven** would wear plain white robes, weep, and send them off. Yet in the *Li Ji* (Rites) and the *Fen Dian* (Ancient Texts), there is no such account. Since this has no basis, I have clarified it plainly.

The *Dian* refers to the **Five Classics of the Five Emperors**, and the *Fen* refers to the **Three Classics of the Three Sovereigns**.

As for **Qín Bó** weeping before his troops—this is recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, **Lí 32nd Year**: Qin Bó attacked Zheng. The Qin minister **Qí Zǐ** garrisoned Zheng and sent word to Qin: *"The people of Zheng have entrusted me with the keys to their northern gate. If you secretly advance your troops, the state can be taken."* Qin Bó consulted the minister **Jiān Shū**, who said: *"To weary your troops in a surprise attack on a distant land—this is not what I have heard. When your troops are exhausted and the enemy is prepared, how can this succeed? The enemy will surely know of your movements. Even if you march a thousand *lǐ*, who will not know?"* Qin Bó declined.

He summoned **Mèng Míng**, **Xī Qǐ**, and **Bái Yǐ**, ordering them to march from the eastern gate. Jiān Shū wept and said: *"Master Mèng, I see your army depart, but I shall not see it return."* Qin Bó sent a messenger to him: *"How do you know? You may yet live to see your grave’s cypress arch."*

Jiān Shū’s son accompanied the army and wept as he sent them off: *"The Jin will intercept you at **Guāi**, where there are two mounds. The southern mound is the tomb of **Gāo of Xià**, and the northern mound is where **Wén Wáng** took shelter from wind and rain. If you die here, I will gather your bones."*

The Qin army then marched east. Passing through the northern gate of Zhou, the officers removed their helmets and dismounted, with three hundred chariots leaping over the barrier. **Wángsūn Mǎn**, still young, observed this and reported to **Xiāng Wáng**: *"The Qin army is reckless and disrespectful—it will surely be defeated. Recklessness means few strategies; disrespect means arrogance. To enter peril while arrogant, and yet lack strategy—how can it avoid defeat?"*

At **Huá**, a Zheng merchant named **Xián Gāo**, who was traveling to Zhou for trade, encountered them. He sent a chariot covered in white oxhide and twelve oxen to provision the army, while urgently reporting to Zheng. Zheng’s **Mù Gōng** inspected the guest quarters and found them packed with supplies, weapons sharpened, and horses fed. He sent **Wǔ Zǐ** to decline:

*"Your Excellency has lingered in our humble state through winter. Our dried meat and grain are nearly exhausted. As you prepare to depart, Zheng has **Yuán Pù**, just as Qin has **Jù Yòu**. Take its deer and boar to relieve our scarcity—how could you refuse?"*

**Qí Zǐ** fled to Qi, while **Féng Sūn** and **Yáng Sūn** fled to Song. **Mèng Míng** said: *"Zheng is prepared—we cannot hope to succeed. We cannot take it by assault nor besiege it indefinitely. We should return."* They destroyed Huá and retreated.

**Yuán Zhěn** of Jin said: *"Qin defied Jiān Shū and exhausted the people through greed. Heaven aids us. We must not let this opportunity pass, nor spare the enemy. To spare the enemy breeds future calamity; to defy Heaven brings misfortune."* He attacked the Qin army.

**Lè Zhī** protested: *"How can we strike back at Qin before repaying their kindness?"* **Xiān Zhěn** replied: *"Qin did not mourn our late lord and attacked our kin. Qin has been without propriety—what kindness is there? I have heard: to spare the enemy once is a disaster for generations. Considering our descendants, how can this be called serving the dead?"* He issued the order, and the **Jiāng Róng** troops mobilized.

**Xiāng Gōng** donned mourning black, with **Liáng Hóng** as charioteer and **Lái Qíu** as right-hand man. On the **fourth month, xīn-sì**, they defeated the Qin army at **Guāi**, capturing **Bǎilǐ Mèng Míng**, **Xī Qǐ Shù**, and **Bái Yǐ Bǐng**, and returning them.

They then buried **Wén Gōng** in mourning black, and from then on, Jin adopted the mourning black.

**Wén Yīng** pleaded for the lives of the three generals: *"They truly provoked our two lords. If our lord were to eat them, he would not be sated. Why dishonor yourself by punishing them? Let them return to Qin to face execution, fulfilling our lord’s will—what could be better?"* The duke agreed.

**Xiān Zhěn** questioned the Qin prisoners. The duke said: *"The lady has requested their release; I have granted it."* Xiān Zhěn, enraged, said: *"A warrior binds them in the field, yet a woman’s plea sets them free in the capital. This undermines military strength and emboldens the enemy—ruin is inevitable. He spat and turned away."* The duke sent **Yáng Chǔ Fù** to pursue him.

When they reached the River, they were already aboard the boats. The left horse was released, and the Duke’s command was given to present a gift to **Mèng Míng**.

**Mèng Míng** knelt and bowed his head, saying: *"Your lordship’s grace spared me, though I had provoked your drums and bells, and sent me back to face execution in Qin. Even if my lord should slay me, my name would not fade. If, by your lordship’s mercy, I am spared, in three years I shall repay your favor with a bow."*

The **Qin ruler** wore mourning black at the riverbank, facing the departing army and weeping: *"I heeded not **Jiǎn Shū**’s counsel, bringing shame upon these officers. This is my fault alone. I should not have punished **Mèng Míng**. This was my error—what crime did the ministers commit? Moreover, I shall not let one misstep obscure a great virtue. **Jiǎn Shū**’s weeping foretold the army’s certain defeat. My own weeping mourns the defeat of my troops. Both wept not for victory, but for the ruin of their forces."*

The **True Scripture of Dao and Virtue** in the *Broad Explication of the Sage’s Intentions* (卷二十六) concludes thus:

*"To wage war is to delight in slaughter—this a gentleman would never do. The Dao cherishes life; sages follow this principle. Yet victory and defeat in battle both bring harm to men. One may simply restrain oneself and cease warfare—why wait to mourn after killing?*

*To cultivate one’s self: if the five desires assail within, the five spirits grow weary and scattered; if the six emotions surge unchecked, the six senses clash in strife. Qi is depleted, the spirit exhausted—death’s shadow looms near. One must firmly suppress desires and emotions, preserving tranquility and harmony.*

*So too the ruler who governs the realm should not prize the beauty of fine arms. The *True Scripture of Dao and Virtue* ends here."*

To summon the **Wu** [武] to decline: according to the *Zuozhuan* [《左传》], **"Wu"** [之] should be **"Huang"** [皇]. **My Lord** lingers in winter at our humble domain: according to the *Zuozhuan*, **"winter"** [冬] should be **"long"** [久].

**The Broad Explication of the Sage’s Intentions** (卷之二十七) – **Master Guangcheng of the Tang Dynasty** (唐广成先生), **Du Guangting** (杜光庭) expounds:

**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao/Way is Ever Nameless** (道常无名章)

**Explication:**
The previous chapter elucidates that fine arms bring ill fortune, hence the Dao/Way does not dwell therein.
This chapter reveals that if a sovereign lord upholds the Dao/Way, all things beneath him will submit in reverence.
First, it marks the nameless Dao/Way to clarify the Way;
Next, it speaks of guarding the Way and attaining celestial blessings,
Then it expounds broadly upon its governance and application,
And finally, it illustrates the Way’s descent to demonstrate its efficacy.

**Meaning:**
Though arms may be fine, they are the greatest calamity for all under heaven.
Though **Pu** [朴] is small, it is the greatest foundation for all under heaven.
If a sovereign lord can guard the Way, all things will take him as their revered model.
When the Way’s transformation takes effect, heaven and earth descend blessings.
No need for stern decrees—people naturally harmonize.
The sovereign preserves the power of governance; all things find their proper place.
Ten thousand nations flock in allegiance, like streams converging toward the sea.
Thus, the sovereign who cultivates benevolent transformation
Is not one who prizes the beauty of military might.

**The Dao/Way is ever nameless.**
**Annotation:**
The Way’s essence lies in its application—this is its constancy.
Constancy can respond to all things, yet its responses are not singular,
Hence, at its constancy, there is no name.
**Explication:**
Application of the Way is limitless,
Adapting only to what is sensed—this is the Way’s constancy.
Constancy exists in its application, yet its responses are not singular,
Hence, at its constancy, there is no name—thus it is said: *constancy without name*.
**Meaning:**
The Way’s function is to do nothing while achieving all.
It governs yin and yang, encompassing and nurturing all things.
The **Qian** [乾] moves through it; the **Kun** [坤] finds stability in it.
Its penetration into life is the most universal under heaven,
Its profundity is the most mysterious under heaven.
Application is boundless, circulation endless—
Even the finest blades of grass receive it and flourish,
Heaven and earth gain it to perfect roundness and squareness.
Yet the true constancy of the Way is serene and void,
Profoundly still, beyond all naming.
When words fail to grasp its essence, it is *constancy without name*.

**Pu** [朴], though small, none under heaven dare to subject it.
**Annotation:**
**Pu** [朴] is the wondrous origin.
The wondrous origin is pure and singular, hence it is called *small* yet responds to all.
When its application is perfected, it becomes the greatest, hence none dare to subject the Way to it.
**Explication:**
**Pu** [朴] is the wondrous origin.
When speaking of its universal generation, it is called the Way;
When discussing its pure singularity, it is called **Pu**.
The wondrous origin is pure and singular, hence it is called *small*.
Yet when its application is perfected and it generates all things, it is the greatest.
Hence none dare to subject the Way to it.

**Meaning:**
The Way’s true essence is tranquil and without action.
Hence it is called **Pu**.
What **Pu** generates and perfects through adaptation is called the Way.
The Way and **Pu** are one—
Not one yet one, this is called *true oneness*.
**True oneness** is the most refined of mysteries,
The purest of the pure.
Oneness is not manifold, hence it is called *small*.
With this true oneness, it transforms into myriad forms,
Its greatness is boundless, its height unparalleled—
Who dares to subject the Way to it?
The subject is one who is beneath the sovereign.

The *Spring and Autumn Annals* [《春秋》] states:
Heaven has ten suns, men have ten ranks.
The lower serves the higher; the higher nourishes the divine.
The male is called a subject; the female, a concubine.
Hence, the king’s subjects are the dukes,
The dukes’ subjects are the great officers,
The great officers’ subjects are the knights,
The knights’ subjects are the footmen,
The footmen’s subjects are the laborers,
The laborers’ subjects are the servants,
The servants’ subjects are the attendants,
The attendants’ subjects are the slaves.
Horses have their grooms; cattle have their herdsmen—
All to attend to myriad affairs.
Under all heaven, there is no land not the king’s;
At the king’s borders, there is no subject not his.
Yet from ancient times to this day,
None dare to subject the Way to them.

If a sovereign lord can guard the Way,
All things will naturally submit in reverence.
**Annotation:**
If a sovereign lord can guard the Way’s pure singularity,
Doing nothing yet transforming all,
Then all things will naturally submit in reverence.
**Explication:**
Speaking of a sovereign lord who embraces and guards the wondrous origin’s pure singularity,
Doing nothing yet achieving transformation,
Then the eight **feng** [埏] regions will look upward to his Way,
The four seas will return to his virtue—
Basking in his power and drinking in his harmony,
All will naturally submit in reverence.

**Meaning:**
The sovereign is the exalted one of the four seas.
The lord is the second rank of the five grades.
The Zhou Dynasty established five grades of nobility:
Duke, lord, earl, viscount, and baron.
Ancestral rulers’ institutions had:
The Son of Heaven, the feudal lords, the ministers,
The great officers, and the knights—
Also five grades, yet encompassing the sovereign’s authority.
Their governance of lands, their ceremonial rites, and their laws of punishment
Also had five grades.
Thus, the sovereign rules all under heaven,
The feudal lords govern their respective states,
The ministers, great officers, and knights serve as auxiliary subjects,
Aiding the sovereign.

Speaking of lords who can guard the Way:
Though they are merely holders of land,
If they guard the Way’s transformation of all things,
Then the eight **feng** [埏] regions and the four seas’ people
Will reverence their Way and virtue,
Return to their utmost benevolence,
Bask in their abundant power,
And drink in their harmonizing warmth—
Thus all will naturally submit in reverence.
**Feng** [埏] refers to the borders of sealed domains.
**Bin** [宾] means submission.
When foreign nations submit to civilization, they are treated as guests and submit in reverence.
**Fu** [附] means to follow and submit.

When heaven and earth unite,
They descend sweet dew.
**Explication:**
If a sovereign lord guards the Way to bring about peace,
There will be no disasters or calamities.
The earth is stable; heaven is complete—
The two *qi* [气] harmonize in balance,
Uniting to descend sweet dew in blessing upon the sovereign lord.

**Meaning:**
If feudal lords guard the Way within their states,
And the sovereign guards the Way over all under heaven,
Then they can bring about harmony between heaven and earth,
Without the fluctuations of disasters and calamities.
The earth is stable; heaven is complete—
The natural order is not lost,
The two *qi* [气] harmonize in balance and unity,
Thus descending blessings.
The *Yijing* [《易》] **Tai** [泰] hexagram’s *Tuan* [《彖》] says:
*"When heaven and earth harmonize in balance"* [天地交泰],
And again:
*"When heaven and earth unite, all things flourish"* [天地交而万物通],
*"When the upper and lower harmonize, their intentions align"* [上下交而其志同].

The **Dao** of heaven and earth—
Yin and Yang respond in kind,
Cold and warmth follow in succession,
When the *qi* [气] interact, all things flourish and transform,
Each attaining its proper place.

When all things attain their proper place,
The harmonious *qi* [气] unite in balance,
Then auspicious omens descend.

Sweet dew is the finest dew,
The essence of divine spirits,
The benevolent blessings of virtue,
Its condensation like fat,
Its sweetness like syrup.

One name is *Sweet Dew* [甘露],
Another is *Heaven’s Wine* [天酒].
The *Rites of Combat and Ceremonial Dignity* [《礼斗威仪》] states:
*"When a ruler governs with earthly sovereignty and brings about great peace,*
*Then sweet dew descends."*

The *Omen of the Mandate* [《稽命征》] says:
*"When posthumous titles are conferred with proper names,*
*Then sweet dew descends upon bamboo and cypress."*

The *Harmonizing with the Divine in the Classic of Filial Piety* [《孝经援神契》] declares:
*"When virtue reaches heaven,*
*Then sweet dew descends."*

Sweet dew is the *qi* of perfect balance.
The *Book of the Mandarin’s Crown* [《鹖冠子》] states:
*"The virtue of the Sage*
*Ascends to the **Taiting** [太清],
*Descends to the **Ta’an** [太宁],
*Penetrates all spirits,
*Then sweet dew descends and all things flourish abundantly.*
*To drink of it grants a lifespan of eight hundred years."*

The *Records of Celestial Phenomena* [《天文录》] notes:
*"The star **Tianyu** [天乳] in the **Dixiu** [氐宿] constellation’s north*
*Governed by the sweet dew star,*
*When it shines brightly, sweet dew descends."*

The *Lost Scriptures* [《逸书》] say:
*"Earth stable, heaven complete—*
*This is harmony.*
*It speaks of earth stabilizing its transformations,*
*Heaven fulfilling its decrees,*
*Upper and lower in accord—*
*This is proper balance.*
*When *qi* [气] is disordered, it is **Ling** [凌].*
*When *qi* is perverse, it is **Yi** [沴].*
*When *qi* brings calamity, it is **disaster** [灾].*
*When *qi* brings harm, it is **injury** [害].*
*When *qi* brings auspicious omens, it is **瑞** [瑞].*
*To **attain** [致] is for blessings to come without summoning.*
*None command it, yet it is naturally balanced."*

The commentary states:
*"When sovereigns and kings embrace and safeguard the **One** [精一],*
*Then earth stabilizes, heaven fulfills,*
*Their harmony **attains** [致] proper balance,*
*And thus sweet dew descends in abundance."*

*"The descent of sweet dew*
*Makes the **sagebrush** [萧] and **orchids** [兰] alike flourish,*
*Without need for instruction or command,*
*Yet all is naturally even."*

*"**Stabilizing** [平] means*
*To emulate sovereigns and kings who measure things and distribute them evenly."*

The exposition says:
*"None [莫] means ‘not’ [无].*
*It speaks of Heaven’s descent of sweet dew,*
*Benevolence bestowed without intent,*
*No human decree yet all is naturally balanced as one.*
*Just as sovereigns and kings measure things and distribute them evenly,*
*Without favoritism or partiality."*

*"When benevolent transformation reaches **Great Harmony** [大同],*
*All under Heaven submits without question,*
*From east to west—*
*Why would they not serve?*
*Just as the people of the four quarters*
*Delight in the **Dao/Way** [化] of the **Wen** and **Wu** [文武] kings."*

*"First governing [始制] has a name,*
*And when the name is established,*
*The commentary states:*
*‘When rulers **attain** [致] balance through the Dao,*
*They can first govern named things.’*
*Thus, all named things*
*Shall be fully governed by sovereigns and kings."*

The exposition further explains:
*"**Govern** [制] means **to control** [御].*
*Named things [有名] are those*
*That bear names across all lands.*
*Fully [尽] means complete possession.*
*It speaks of sovereigns and kings embracing and safeguarding the One,*
*Then Heaven descends auspicious omens,*
*Benevolent transformation without intent,*
*And all is naturally even as one.*
*Thus, they can first govern named things,*
*All creatures submit to virtuous rule,*
*And so named things are fully possessed by kings and sovereigns."*

The interpretation says:
*"Sovereigns and kings of the Dao,*
*Heaven and Earth unite in virtue,*
*Auspicious omens respond,*
*Upper and lower realms in harmony without division.*
*All four seas submit,*
*Named things all return to benevolent transformation.*
*The four seas are*
*The lands sovereigns and kings govern.*
*Expanding the Dao and establishing virtue,*
*All are transformed by it.*
*Within their borders,*
*And along the shores of their domains,*
*Who is not the sovereign’s and king’s subject?*
*Just as mountains and forests do not desire birds and beasts,*
*Yet their lushness and depth draw them to dwell there;*
*Just as rivers and lakes do not desire fish and dragons,*
*Yet their vastness and expanse invite them to abide;*
*Just as kings and sovereigns do not desire named things,*
*Yet their virtue and benevolence cause named things to submit;*
*Just as cultivating the self does not desire the Dao,*
*Yet its emptiness and tranquility invite the Dao to return.*
*All things respond and gather,*
*Depending on what is cultivated.*
*Natural balance and universal submission,*
*All under Heaven in peace,*
*Depend on what is transformed.*

*"The return of goodness to oneself,*
*The resonance of the Dao,*
*The compliance of things,*
*All depend on upholding virtue [崇德].*
*This is the knowledge of **stopping** [止].*
*Knowing **stopping** prevents **danger** [殆]."*

The commentary states:
*"If sovereigns and kings can govern named things,*
*Then those named things shall know*
*To rely and abide in sovereigns and kings of the Dao,*
*And thus avoid all perils and dangers."*

The exposition says:
*"**Danger** [殆] means perilous and precarious.*
*When sovereigns and kings abide by the Dao and transform the people,*
*All things submit as guests.*
*Then those named things shall know*
*To rely and abide in sovereigns and kings of the Dao,*
*And thus avoid all perils and dangers.*
*Hence it is said:*
*‘Knowing stopping prevents danger.’*

The interpretation says:
*"When the Dao of sovereigns and kings harmonizes with Heaven,*
*And inner and outer realms are at peace,*
*Within their borders,*
*All living and growing named things*
*Follow their lands and become the sovereign’s and king’s subjects.*
*Things submit to the realm of the Dao,*
*Thus there is no peril or ruin.*
*Following the **spring and summer** [春夏] to grow,*
*Conforming to the **autumn and winter** [秋冬] to decline,*
*Neither Heaven nor Earth will abandon them,*
*No northern blight nor southern pestilence will afflict them,*
*They will not be invaded by external foes,*
*Nor struck by excessive punishments,*
*Each fulfilling its nature—*
*What perils or dangers could there be?*
*This is the **imperial decree/sage’s intent** [圣旨].’*

*"Now, if sovereigns and kings*
*Transform the people through the Dao,*
*And respond to Heaven’s auspicious omens,*
*If the people submit to their transformation,*
*And all under Heaven is in balance,*
*Then sovereigns and kings must*
*Abide by the Dao, practice humility [撝谦],*
*Bear and receive the **auspicious omens** [符瑞],*
*Know stopping, and be cautious,*
*To conform to Heaven’s will,*
*And thus avoid all perils and dangers.*

*If they see Heaven’s auspicious omens,*
*And the people’s harmony,*
*Yet grow arrogant in their hearts,*
*Change their resolve,*
*And boast of achievements while claiming credit for good deeds,*
*Then the omens cannot withstand their pride,*
*And their own lives shall be in peril."*

*"In ancient times,*
*Zhou’s last king saw small birds giving birth to large birds,*
*And took it as an omen of national prosperity,*
*Yet his arrogance and indulgence led to excessive schemes,*
*And thus his downfall.*
*Laozi feared that future emperors and kings,*
*Relying on auspicious omens,*
*Would become proud and arrogant,*
*And thus warned them:*
*‘Know stopping, so as to avoid danger.’*

*"The Dao in all under Heaven*
*Is like rivers and streams to the great seas.*
*The commentary states:*
*‘Heaven descends sweet dew,*
*To bestow auspicious omens upon virtuous rulers,*
*And when it is lenient and forgiving to all under Heaven,*
*Heaven responds accordingly.’"*

The Dao in all under Heaven flows like rivers and streams to the great seas—such is its course.

**Commentary:**
Here, it concludes that if lords and kings uphold the Dao, Heaven will surely respond. Thus it says: *"If a virtuous ruler governs with benevolent virtue, he naturally brings about Great Peace. The harmonious qi moves Heaven, and auspicious omens will surely respond—just as rivers and streams flow into the seas."*

**Meaning:**
Lords and kings who uphold the Dao, their virtue harmonizing with Heaven, their benevolent transformations uniting all—this is how they inspire Great Peace. Heaven’s auspicious signs, like rivers flowing to the sea, are the will of the Sage.

Now, if a lord or king, moved by Heaven’s omens, wins the people’s hearts, and all under the Four Seas submit as subjects, yet he further, in response to these omens, remains vigilant night and day, ever cautious and diligent, each day more prudent than the last—then there will be no peril. Distant peoples will admire his virtuous governance, sending envoys as tribute-bearers, like rivers converging toward the sea, waves rushing to the ocean. Near and far, they will flock, and the nation’s fate will flourish.

For those who govern their bodies, the heart is the sovereign, the viscera the lords. If one calms the heart’s king, embracing and guarding the True Dao, then Heaven and Earth’s primordial essence-qi will be absorbed and transformed within the body, becoming jade nectar and sweet dew. The Three-in-One Spirit will drink with one’s own essence, blending and harmonizing within—inner and outer balanced, without need for forced breathing or cultivation. Dwelling in the Hall of Jade and the Chamber of Precious Stones, the thirty-six thousand yin-yang deities will stand complete, settled and undispersed. Then the body will know no perilous calamity, the life no untimely end—ascending to the Upper Pure, drifting freely like rivers flowing to the sea, without obstruction.

**Knowing Others: The Third Chapter of Wisdom**

**Commentary:**
The previous chapter showed how lords and kings upholding the Dao make all things submit. This chapter explains how those who submit serve a virtuous ruler—all because of self-knowledge and self-mastery. Self-knowledge brings clarity; self-mastery brings completeness and strength. It concludes with the warning: *"To die yet not perish, to act without violating Heaven’s order."*

**Meaning:**
Lords and kings uphold the Dao and transform all things, making them return to their source, because they possess clarity of self-knowledge and strength in self-mastery. Content yet not greedy, diligent in the Dao, they align with Heaven and Earth, never straying from their nature. Thus they fulfill their allotted measure, suffering no untimely death, and remain in perfect harmony, never violating Heaven’s decrees.

Knowing others is wisdom; knowing oneself is enlightenment.

**Commentary:**
Wisdom is the ability to discern and use knowledge of things; enlightenment is the radiant insight that perceives the subtle.

Wisdom has its limits; enlightenment knows no bounds.

**Commentary:**
Knowledge is recognition and discernment. When the heart aligns with its object, innate knowledge arises—this is called knowing the law.

**Meaning:**
The heart’s illumination is all-pervasive. Knowledge arises with phenomena; without phenomena, knowledge ceases. Thus, when one employs the heart’s wisdom, it is through engagement with phenomena.

If the object is pure, the heart and knowledge are pure; if the object is corrupt, the heart and knowledge are corrupt. Suffering, joy, life, death, fortune, misfortune, good, and evil—all stem from this.

Thus, entering an empty chamber, the heart of desire arises; entering a sacred temple, the heart of reverence arises. A thousand phenomena draw the heart, scattering it with them. How can one not be cautious, when good and evil are so intertwined?

Wisdom lies in knowing others—*The Book of Documents* says: *"To know others is to be wise."*

In knowing others, consider the Duke of Song’s wisdom. Song’s Duke Xuan abandoned his own son Ji to establish his younger brother Ru as heir, making him Duke Mu. In the third year of Duke Huan of Lu, Duke Mu of Song fell ill and summoned the Grand Marshal Kongfu, saying: *"My predecessor abandoned Ji to establish me as ruler. I dare not forget this. If, by your virtue, you can preserve your life to the end, and my predecessor asks why Ji was abandoned, what answer shall you give? I entrust you to uphold the state. Even in death, I will have no regret."*

Kongfu replied: *"The ministers wish to establish your son Ping as heir."*

Duke Mu said: *"No. My predecessor deemed me worthy to rule the state. If I abandon virtue and refuse to yield, I would betray my predecessor’s foundation—how could I claim wisdom?"* He sought to honor his predecessor’s virtuous decree, striving not to fail. He then sent his son Ping to reside in Zheng and yielded the throne to Ji, who became Duke Zang.

The Sage said: *"Duke Xuan of Song may be called one who truly knew others. He established Duke Mu, and his son inherited the throne, receiving the name Yi-fu. The* Shang Ode *says: ‘Receiving the Mandate of Shang, all was fitting; a hundred blessings were bestowed upon him.’ This is what is meant by supreme knowledge of others."*

The text reads:

*"The Commentary says: ‘When people employ their minds to discern the good and evil of others, the common folk call that wisdom.’ But if one reflects inward and examines without relying on the mind, perceiving the truth of things without contrived knowledge, and can thus be—this is called **‘mingliao’** (明了). Hence it is said: ‘He who knows others is wise; he who knows himself is enlightened’ (明了).

*‘Yi’* (义) says: ‘The worldly employ their minds in response to external circumstances, distinguishing others’ virtues and vices, measuring their own strengths and weaknesses, seeking what they do not know rather than what they do, abandoning themselves to emulate others, and flaunting their cleverness to gain favor—this is gathering the varied people of the realm to delight in the **‘yìyì’** (役役, servile flattery) of those who curry approval, discarding the **‘tiándàn wúwéi’** (恬澹无为, tranquil and effortless) to favor the **‘hēnghēng zhī yì’** (哼哼之意, petty scheming)—such men are the ones who disrupt the **Dao** (道) and bring chaos to the world. Their wisdom is indeed a flaw.

*Thus*, they blind the clarity of the sun and moon above, erode the essence of mountains and rivers below, disrupt the harmony of the four seasons within, and even the smallest creatures—worms, insects, and the tiniest of life—lose their natural ways. The Master said to **Yán Huí** (颜回): ‘Do not listen with your ears, but listen with your mind; do not listen with your mind, but listen with your **qi** (气).’ To forget wisdom in wisdom, to forget knowledge in knowledge, to observe the wonder and abide in the **‘wú’** (无, non-duality)—this is **‘mingliao’** (明了). This is the **‘Xīnzhāi’** (心斋, mental fasting) that **Zhuāngzǐ** (庄子) attributes to the Master’s words to **Yán Huí**.

*He who overcomes others has strength*; *he who overcomes himself is powerful* (强).
*The Annotation says*: ‘Those who can conquer others through **‘quánzhì’** (权智, cunning and expedience) may rightly be called strong.’ But those who can conquer their own minds, making them **‘róuruò’** (柔弱, soft and yielding), are the ones who truly preserve their **‘qiáng’** (强, power). Hence the passage below says: ‘To hold fast to softness is power; softness overcomes hardness, weakness overcomes strength.’ Thus it is said: *‘He who overcomes himself is powerful’*.

*‘Yi’* (义) says: ‘Some men wield the authority of their lords to dominate others, wielding their might over the people so that all stand in awe—this is called strength. Yet they do not know the **Dao** (道) of **‘wúwéi’** (无为, non-action), nor do they cultivate their own hearts. When the heart is without action, the will becomes soft and weak; when the heart is empty and the will feeble, no force dares intrude—this is true power. He who overcomes others exhausts his strength and loses his influence, and thus meets his end; he who overcomes himself enters the **‘míng’** (冥, profound stillness) of the **Dao** and aligns with its essence, and thus attains **‘xiān’** (仙, transcendence).

*He who knows contentment is rich*; *he who perseveres in action has resolve*.
*The Annotation says*: ‘He who knows to be content and does not covet may rightly be called rich. He who strives with unyielding effort, persevering in self-awareness and never wavering, may rightly be called one of firm resolve.’

*The Commentary says*: ‘Contentment lies in the heart. If the heart knows contentment, then there is no craving, even if one dines on coarse rice in a gourd and dwells in a narrow lane—unshaken, one finds sufficiency, and thus may be called rich. If one strives with tireless effort, never flagging, maintaining self-awareness and resolve without relenting, this is one of firm resolve.’

*‘Yi’* (义) says: ‘Greed and frugality, virtue and corruption—these all arise from the heart. He whose heart is content, whether **Yán Huí** (颜回) with his single gourd of drink or **Yáng Xióng** (杨雄) with his ten thousand pieces of gold, remains unchanged in his joy and ever content. But he whose heart is never satisfied, though he hoards the exclusive profits of **Shēn Hóu** (申侯) or fills his courtyard with the finest carriages and silks of **Sì Tài** (驷泰), has never truly known contentment. Thus **Yán Huí** and **Yáng Xióng** may rightly be called rich.

*He who perseveres in good deeds, guards the **Dao** without deviation, may be called one who overcomes himself and is powerful—one whose resolve never falters or changes*.
*True power lies in the practice of the **Dao***.
*When greatness has the **Dao**, it conquers without battle; when smallness has the **Dao**, it gains without strife*.
*To act with sincerity in the **Dao** and fortify one’s resolve—this is true power*.
*The **Yìjīng** (易) says: ‘The virtuous person strengthens themselves without ceasing.’*

**‘Zhuānshí’** (箪食, coarse rice in a gourd) refers to what *The Analects* say: ‘How excellent was **Yán Huí**! Coarse rice in a gourd, water in a ladle, dwelling in a narrow lane—others could not bear his hardships, yet **Yán Huí** remained unchanged in his joy.’ **Zhuān** (箪) is a small basket; **piáo** (瓢) is a gourd. The **‘lòuxiàng’** (陋巷, narrow lane) is a humble dwelling. It speaks of **Yán Huí**’s enduring poverty while he abides in the **Dao** and finds joy within.

*He who does not lose their place endures*.
*The Annotation says*: ‘If one knows contentment and strives with perseverance, never losing their true path, then they endure in the **Dao**.’

*The Commentary further explains*: ‘If one’s actions never stray from their proper place, then they can endure for long.’

*‘Yi’* (义) says: ‘He who knows contentment and does not covet, who finds joy in poverty and the **Dao**, who strives in good deeds and never deviates from their true nature—when all their actions align with the seasons and they find their place naturally, they dwell in harmony and thus endure for long.’ The **Yìjīng** says: ‘If one does not steadfastly uphold their **‘dé’** (德, virtue/power), they may face disgrace in what they inherit.’ Thus, one’s conduct must be rooted in enduring constancy, never losing their place.

*He who loses their place must invite misfortune*.
*As in the case of the **Tàishū Dāng** (郑太叔段, Duke Zang’s younger brother), who was indulged without restraint, and when **Zhuānggōng** (庄公) would not heed the warning of **Jì Zhōng** (祭仲), the great minister, who said: ‘It would be better to establish his place early, lest his ambition grow unchecked and become difficult to curb. Even creeping weeds cannot be easily removed—how much more so a favored younger brother!’
**Zhuānggōng** did not comply. Later, **Tàishū Dāng** (段) commanded the western and northern border regions to pledge allegiance to him, encroaching upon the land as far as **Bìnyán** (禀延). He then fortified his city walls, gathered his people, polished his armor, and prepared his chariots and soldiers, intending to attack **Zhèng** (郑). The duke ordered **Zǐ Fēng** (子封) to lead three hundred chariots and strike against **Tàishū Dāng** in **Yān** (鄢). The duke’s forces marched against him in **Yān**. In the fifth month, **Tàishū Dāng** fled to **Gōng** (恭), and the duke’s army defeated him.

*It was because of **Zhuānggōng**’s mother, **Wǔ Jiāng** (武姜), that he was born in a dream-like state and named **‘wùshēng’** (寤生, awakened birth). Thus she came to hate **Zhuānggōng** and love **Tàishū Dāng** (段). When **Dāng** (段) sought to attack **Zhèng** (郑), **Wǔ Jiāng** intended to aid him. But after **Zhuānggōng**’s victory over **Dāng**, he exiled **Wǔ Jiāng** to **Chéngyǐng** (城颖) and swore to her: ‘Until we reach the **‘Huángquán’** (黄泉, underworld), we shall never meet again.’"*

Later, **Zhuānggōng** regretted his actions. The **Yǐnggǔ** (颖谷) border official **Kǎochóu** (考叔), upon seeing him abandon the feast and leave the meat uneaten, advised **Zhuānggōng** to take back his mother. He dug a tunnel down to the spring, allowing **Wǔ Jiāng** to reunite with **Tàishū Dāng** secretly, restoring their mother-son bond as before.

The *Spring and Autumn Annals* recorded: *"The Duke of **Zhèng** subdued **Dāng** at **Yān**,"* criticizing his failure to uphold proper governance.

This passage argues that allowing **Tàishū Dāng**’s transgressions to escalate until they overflowed before acting was a mistake—one that failed to address the root cause. Had **Dāng** not strayed from his proper place, how could such calamity have befallen him?

*"To die without perishing is longevity."* **Annotation:** *"Death"* refers to the natural end of one’s allotted fate; *"perishing"* denotes untimely ruin; *"longevity"* signifies the fulfillment of one’s destined span.

*"He who knows others yet surpasses them will invite misfortune. He who knows sufficiency and strengthens his essence aligns with the Dao’s natural order. Those who align with the Dao’s order die without perishing—that is, they fulfill their destined span and may be called long-lived."*

**Exegesis:** *"Death"* refers to the natural end of one’s allotted fate; *"perishing"* denotes untimely ruin; *"longevity"* signifies the fulfillment of one’s destined span. It speaks of yielding to nature’s harmony, avoiding excess, and letting go in accordance with the Dao—thus completing one’s allotted time and being called long-lived. If one does not temper excess, even if **Shàn Bào** (单豹) retains the vigor of a child or **Zhāng Yì** (张毅) enjoys noble stature, they fail to complete their natural course—how then can they be called long-lived?

Thus **Zhuāngzi** said: *"None are longer-lived than the stillborn child, while **Péngzǔ** (彭祖) dies young."*

**Explanation:** Between heaven and earth, life must give way to death. Life is the harmony of heaven and earth; death is their natural fulfillment. To dwell in harmony and submit to nature is to align with the Dao. To oppose this is but untimely ruin.

The *Hé Tú* (河图) states: *"Man is granted a measure by heaven—forty-three thousand two hundred breaths, governing the day; one hundred twenty cycles, governing the year. This is the allotted span of mortal life. Those who attain the Dao of the Golden Elixir may extend beyond it. Those lacking cultivation suffer premature decline."*

The *Huángtíng Jīng* (黄庭经) declares:
*"A hundred twenty years may yet be reclaimed,
Beyond that, guarding the Dao is hard.
Only with the nine-refined, eight-essenced elixir,
And preserving the seven primal essences,
Can the radiance of sun and moon heal old decay."*

This shows that through cultivation, one may prolong life. But if one adheres to their natural endowment, yielding to heaven’s harmony, born in accordance with the Dao and departing in accordance with the Dao—this is life. If one resists, this is death. If one exhausts their allotted span, they may be called long-lived. Otherwise, they perish prematurely.

As **Zhuāngzi** says in *"Dá Shēng"* (达生):
*"Dàikāi* (田开) told **Zhōu Wēi Gōng** (周威公): ‘The diviner **Zhù Shèn** (祝肾) said: *Those who nurture life well do so like tending sheep—watching their rear and urging them forward.* There was a man named **Shàn Bào** in **Lǔ**, who lived in caves and drank from streams, sharing no gains with others. At seventy, he still had the complexion of a child—yet was devoured by a hungry tiger. There was **Zhāng Yì**, whose high-born family was renowned; none dared approach him. Yet he died of fever at forty. **Bào** nourished his inner self while his outer form perished; **Yì** cultivated his outer form while illness consumed his inner essence. These two failed to urge their rear—meaning they clung to one-sided practices, failing to harmonize with the Dao’s fullness. To urge the rear is to discard what is lacking. These two did not complete their natural course and thus perished young."*

To grasp the essence of life’s transformation, one should neither rejoice in living nor fear death—then the stillborn child is long-lived, and **Péngzǔ** dies young.

In *"Qí Wù"* (齐物), **Zhuāngzi** says:
*"Nothing is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet **Tàishān** (太山) is small. None are longer-lived than the stillborn child, yet **Péngzǔ** dies young. Heaven and earth coexist with me, and all things are one with me."*

The first autumn hair to grow is called *"autumn hair."* Those who die before nineteen are called stillborn. This illustrates how the Dao inverts conventional wisdom. In human affairs, the small seek to aspire, the great grow arrogant. But from the Dao’s perspective, there is neither excess nor deficiency—they are one in essence.

*"Death"* is called *"bèng"* (崩) for a **Son of Heaven**, *"hōng"* (薨) for a **marquess**, *"zú"* (卒) for a **high official**, *"bùlù"* (不禄) for a **scholar**, and *"sǐ"* (死) for commoners. Though death and life are decreed by fate, they also depend on one’s conduct. The virtuous observe their actions to discern whether their end will be long or untimely.

The *Yì Jīng* (易经) *Lǚ* (履) hexagram states: *"Observe the footprints and examine the omens."* This is the principle.

In the eleventh year of **Lí** (僖), the *Spring and Autumn Annals* records that **Zhōu Shàngwáng** (周襄王) sent **Nèishǐ Guò** (内史过) to confer a mandate on **Jìn Huì Gōng** (晋惠公). **Huì Gōng** received the mandate but dropped it in disrespect. **Guò** returned and told the king: *"The Duke of **Jìn** will have no heirs."* The king bestowed the mandate, yet he dropped it upon receiving the auspicious token—first abandoning himself, how could he expect succession?

*"Gift"* is the foundation of a state; *"respect"* is the vehicle of gift. Without respect, gift cannot be upheld; without gift, ruler and subjects fall into chaos—how then can the state endure?

In the fourteenth year, **Huì Gōng** fought **Qín** at **Hán Yuán** (韩原) and was captured. He died in the twenty-third year—just as **Guò** and **Shù Jiān** (叔詹) had foretold.

In the same year, **Chǔ** attacked **Sòng** and withdrew. The people of **Zhèng** entertained them with nine offerings, using the rites reserved for **Zhōu’s** highest nobles—each course featuring a hundred dishes, with six sets of **biān dòu** (笾豆). After the feast, at night, they secretly took two daughters of **Sòng Wén Gōng** (宋文公) back to **Chǔ**. **Shù Jiān** said: *"The King of **Chǔ** will not die of old age."* The rites concluded without proper distinction—this could not be called proper. How then could he subdue the other lords? Thus it was known he would not achieve hegemony. Later, he was indeed defeated at **Chéngpú** (城濮) and killed by **Shāng Shèn** (商臣).

Thus, the virtuous person examines the conduct of others, and thereby knows whether they will live long or die young. How much more so for those who cultivate the **Dao/Way** and nourish the **yuanhé** (元和)—how could they fail to attain longevity?

**Moral and True Scripture: Broad Explication of Sacred Meaning, Volume Twenty-Eight**
*Narrated by Master Guangcheng of Tang, Du Guangting*

**Chapter Thirty-Four: "The Dao Flows"**

**Exegesis:**
The previous chapter elucidates the sovereign who follows the **Dao/Way**, attaining self-knowledge and self-mastery. This chapter expounds that those who accomplish great and luminous deeds do so by adhering to the **Dao/Way**, forgetting their own contributions.

It begins with *"The Dao flows"* (大道泛兮), demonstrating that it transcends all boundaries, left or right. Next, it states *"The deed accomplished, yet not possessed"* (功成不有), clarifying that greatness and smallness alike cannot claim it as their own. Hence, the Sage, when uplifting the Sage, does not exalt himself, thereby achieving great and luminous deeds.

**Explication:**
Having clarified that the sovereign who follows the **Dao/Way** attains self-mastery and longevity, we now illustrate his virtue as vast as the **Dao/Way**, unobstructed—neither claiming its deeds, nor relying on its manifestations, nor boasting of its grandeur. Thus, he fulfills great undertakings.

The **Dao/Way** flows—its application is flexible, unbound by direction. *Feng* (封) means boundary; *zhěn* (畛) refers to the paths between fields. Things arise and complete themselves without refusal or possession, neither great nor small. The Sage’s conduct is all-encompassing, unconcerned with personal exaltation, thus achieving true grandeur.

**The Dao Flows, Left and Right:**
**Annotation:** The **Dao/Way** flows—unrestricted yet responsive to all things, neither favoring left nor right.

**Exegesis:** *Feng* (泛) signifies unrestrained. The **Dao/Way**, as a principle, is neither yin nor yang, neither soft nor hard. It flows unrestrained, responding to all phenomena, adaptable to left or right, without partiality.

Thus, *Zhuangzi* says: *"The **Dao/Way** was never confined to boundaries."*

**Explication:** The essence of the **Dao/Way**—congealed, it becomes the True; diffused, it manifests as myriad transformations. It flows without attachment. Like an empty boat, it lacks solid substance; though not obscured, it is not dim—this is not yin. Though not blazing, it is not bright—this is not yang. It sustains heaven and bears earth, vigorous yet fluid like a dragon’s movement—this is not softness. It harmonizes and adapts to all things, penetrating the finest details—this is not hardness. It can manifest or conceal itself, be subtle or evident, unrestrained in its applications. It shapes all forms without discrimination, responding to all phenomena. It permeates all realms without confinement, adaptable to left or right. Unified in its penetration, it serves as the model for all under heaven, without partiality.

Unbounded, it knows no limits—dissolving and dispersing. In emptiness, it returns. In non-possession, it generates all transformations.

*Zhuangzi’s* **"Equivalence of All Things"** states:
*"The ancient True Persons—how far did their knowledge extend? How did they reach such heights? Some say they arrived at the point where nothing yet existed—this is the ultimate, the complete, the unexcelled. Nothing yet existed.*

*Next, they recognized existence, yet no boundaries. This speaks to the initial division of heaven and earth, where life arose within, all things flourished, and pure nature remained unspoiled, untouched by artificiality—thus, no attachments formed.*

*Next, they recognized no right or wrong. Once distinctions arose, the **Dao/Way** began to falter. When the **Dao/Way** falters, partiality emerges.*

*The scholar who cultivates himself must embody the **Dao/Way**, maintaining an empty mind, free from attachments, to attain its subtlety. Governing the realm, he must act naturally, in accordance with the **Dao/Way**, aligning with the great and returning to ultimate principle."*

All things rely on it for life, yet it does not refuse.
**Exegesis:** All things under heaven depend on the **Dao/Way**’s generative function to fulfill their nature. Though the **Dao/Way** generates and transforms with wondrous spontaneity, it does not toil in exhaustion. It is as if things do not even acknowledge the **Dao/Way**’s labor.

**Explication:**
The height of heaven is sustained by the **Dao/Way’s qi**; the depth of earth is borne by the **Dao/Way’s qi**; the proliferation of all things is contained by the **Dao/Way’s qi**. Without the **Dao/Way**’s transformative **qi**, how could such vastness, grandeur, and abundance be achieved? Through the **Dao/Way**’s transformations, all things attain their being—generation upon generation, fully realized.

The **Dao/Way** generates things without action; it transforms things without effort. Though generation and transformation arise from the **Dao/Way**, the **Dao/Way** does not weary from its labor, nor do things repay it for its benevolence. It is like rain and dew—things are nourished below without gratitude, and the rain and dew do not claim credit for their giving.

Thus, the Sage-ruler governs the people, benefits the worthy, and aids all things, mirroring the **Dao/Way**’s generative power and the nourishment of rain and dew. The Sage forgets his deeds above; the people forget imperial might below—thus aligning with ultimate transformation.

**The deed accomplished, yet not possessed.**
**Annotation:** All things rely on the **Dao/Way**’s spontaneous operation for generation and transformation, yet the **Dao/Way** does not claim possession of them.

**Exegesis:** *Function* (功) refers to the **Dao/Way**’s generative power. Though the **Dao/Way**’s generative function is complete, it does not name the things as its own. Another interpretation: Though the **Dao/Way**’s generative function is fulfilled, it never claims possession—this is the meaning of *forgetting function*.

**Explication:**
Regarding possession—all things receive their forms from the **Dao/Way’s qi**. When things attain completion, it is the **Dao/Way**’s function. Were it not for the **Dao/Way’s qi**, the generative function would fail.

**The Dao’s wondrous essence is nameless and void of possession,**
**Its wondrous function is boundless and ceaseless.**

**When things are complete, the Dao does not rely on its own strength,**
**When things are born, the Dao does not claim their generative virtue/power.**
**It neither clings to things as its own virtue/power,**
**Nor seizes them as its own possession.**
**Possession and non-possession are both extinguished,**
**All virtue/power is utterly forgotten—**
**Not only is the virtue/power of generating things forgotten,**
**But all things’ very existence is forgotten as well.**

**It cherishes and nurtures all things without claiming lordship,**
**Yet this cannot be called small.**
**Annotation:** It cherishes all things, yet does not rule over them.
**Toward things, it has no desires—**
**Yet this cannot be called small.**

**Exegesis:** This is a *phonetic exegesis* (声解义).
When it is said *this can be called small*, it means *this cannot be called small*.
The Dao generates all things,
Cherishes and nurtures them to perfection,
Yet does not rule over them.
Toward all things, it harbors no desire—
Could this be the Dao’s narrowness?
Thus, when it is said *this can be called small*, it means *this cannot be called small*.

**Explication:**
The *phonetic exegesis* is like when scholars debate whether something *can* be named—
It is precisely *what cannot be named*.
Examining this further, the scripture says *this can be called small*—
It means *this cannot be called small*.
The Dao’s generative transformation encompasses myriad categories,
Its harmonizing *qi* pervades everywhere without omission,
Nurturing and sustaining them,
Bringing them to completion and growth,
Its loving protection is profound,
Its nurturing virtue/power is universal.
It does not rule over them,
Yet each thing fulfills its own nature,
It harbors no desire toward things—
The virtue/power of containing and nurturing is vast indeed.
This is the sage’s interpretation.

Now, I elucidate:
**All sentient and formed beings—**
**Flying, swimming, moving, and growing,**
**From the smallest blades of grass to the mightiest mountains—**
**The Dao’s *qi* covers and nurtures them,**
**Its strength knows no limits.**
**It cherishes and sustains without claiming lordship,**
**Things depend on the Dao yet do not acknowledge its virtue/power.**

**Though the great *peng* bird has a vast form,**
**It still rides the Dao’s transformation.**
**Even the tiniest moths and insects**
**Rely on the Dao’s shaping virtue/power.**

**Thus, even the smallest hair of autumn—**
**When the Dao’s *qi* abides, it is warm and tender, moist and nourishing;**
**When the Dao’s *qi* departs, it withers and decays.**
**The Dao does not abandon even the smallest hair—**
**This can be called small;**
**It fills the universe—**
**This can be called great;**
**It does not rule over things—**
**This can be called forgetting virtue/power.**
**This is the Dao’s function.**

**It can be called small, it can be called great,**
**Yet it is neither small nor great,**
**Nothing is not small, nothing is not great.**
**All things return to it without its ruling—**
**This can be called great.**
**Annotation:** It cherishes all things, thus all things return to it.
**Though there are myriad differences among things, it does not rule—**
**This can be called great.**
**It cannot be called great,**
**For it is neither small nor great,**
**Thus it is difficult to name.**

**Exegesis:** *All things return to it*—
They return to the Dao’s generative virtue/power.
It is said that all things return to the Dao,
Yet the Dao does not rule over them,
And yet all things exist.
It casts them off yet does not reclaim—
Could this be the Dao’s lack of vastness?
Thus, when it is said *this can be called great*, it means *this cannot be called great*.

**The scripture says *it can be named left or right*—**
**Hence it is neither small nor great.**
**Neither small nor great is indeed difficult to name.**
**The annotation says *myriad differences*—**
This is from *Zhuangzi*’s text.

**Explication:**
The Dao generates and transforms all things,
Things receive their generative virtue/power,
Each returns to virtue/power from the Dao,
Yet the Dao does not rule over them.
It allows things to follow their own nature,
This is not the Dao’s greatness—
Thus, the *phonetic exegesis* says *this can be called great*—
Yet it is not small,
And when it is said *this can be called great*—
It is not great either.
Neither great nor small is difficult to name—
This is what cannot be named.
*Myriad differences*—
From *Zhuangzi*’s *Tian Di Pian* (天地篇), where Confucius says:
*The Dao covers and sustains all things,*
**How vast and grand it is!**
**The gentleman must not fail to carve his heart to conform to it—**
**This is called *wuwei* (无为).**
**To act without action is called *Tian* (天),**
**To speak without speech is called *De* (德).**
**To love and benefit people is called *Ren* (仁),**
**To embrace differences yet remain unified is called great (大),**
**To act without extreme divergence is called broad (宽),**
**To encompass myriad differences is called *Fu* (富).**
**This means though all things differ,**
**The Dao alone remains unified—**
**This is the sage’s interpretation.**

Now, I elucidate:
**The great Dao conceals its virtue/power and hides its name,**
**Silent and formless—**
**This can be called small.**
**All things, when born, generate themselves,**
**When transformed, transform themselves,**
**The Dao allows each to fulfill its nature,**
**Yet does not rule over them—**
**This can be called great.**

**It is also like the sovereign,**
**Who by the Dao nurtures the people,**
**By virtue/power governs the citizens,**
**Observes the harmony of the six *qi* (六气),**
**Follows the commands of the four seasons (四时),**
**Strengthens benevolence with sincerity,**
**Guides conduct with righteousness,**
**Shows love with kindness,**
**Orders with propriety,**
**Teaches with trust,**
**Encourages with rewards—**
**Even when cutting a single blade of grass or felling a tree,**
**He adheres to its proper time,**
**Diligently and warmly,**
**Fearful they might lose their place—**
**This can be called small.**

**When things fulfill their nature,**
**The people find their fitting way,**
**Rulers and subjects rejoice together,**
**Heaven and earth harmonize in tranquility,**
**The sovereign is humble and reverent,**
**Yielding virtue/power to Heaven,**
**Not claiming it as his own,**
**Not ruling over them—**
**This can be called great.**

**Thus, the sage never claims greatness,**
**And so achieves true greatness.**
**Annotation:** Therefore, the sage follows the Dao and forgets virtue/power,
Does not exalt himself as grand,
And so fulfills his grandest deeds.

**Exegesis:** The sage who governs the world,
Spreads virtue/power and bestows blessings,
Establishes pure and harmonizing winds,
Things fulfill their nature in generation and transformation.
Following the Dao, forgetting virtue/power,
Not exalting himself as great—
Thus his vast achievements can be called great,
And his sage virtue/power can be called great,
Because he does not claim greatness—
Thus he attains this exalted greatness.

**The scholar who governs his body**
**Floats without attachment,**
**Like clouds without form,**
**Water without will,**
**He may turn left or right,**
**Follow square or round,**
**Not bound by fixed ways,**
**Yet reflects all that comes before him.**

**Though myriad things are broad, he does not constrain his mind to favor them,**
**Though countless benefits arise, he does not boast his virtue/power of rescue,**
**His kindness extends to all living things,**
**Never hoarding it for himself,**
**All good virtues converge in him,**
**Yet he does not claim them as his own.**
**Thus he reveals the virtue/power that is neither small nor great,**
**And is free from praise or self-deprecation,**
**So he may align with the Dao/Way’s full and true essence.**

**Chapter Thirty-Five: On Grasping the Great Symbol**

**Exegesis:**
The sage who governs the world does not claim greatness,
Yet achieves his grandest deeds—
For he grasps the **Great Symbol**,
And so the world submits to his rule.
Thus his vast achievements can be called great.

**The Great Symbol** is the Dao/Way,
Like the formless yet present in the **huanghu** [恍惚].
All under Heaven submit to it,
Each receiving its blessings.
The sage does not rule with **察察** [overt scrutiny],
Lest he harm them,
And so brings forth the harmony of Heaven and Earth.

**He who grasps the Great Symbol** draws people to him,
Like the lure of music and food—
Thus when the **Eight Sounds** [八音] play in unison,
Hearers delight in their hearts,
When flavors blend in abundance,
Tasters find satisfaction in their mouths,
Then travelers pause to rest.
So too, all under Heaven submit to the ruler of the Dao/Way.

**The greatest words are unadorned,**
**Uttered without relish,**
**The Great Symbol is formless,**
**No seeking in sight or sound.**
Yet through all ages its use renews itself,
Never exhausted.

**When the Great Symbol is grasped, all submit.**
**Annotation:** The Great Symbol is the Dao/Way.
**When the emperor holds the Great Dao/Way to govern the world,**
**All things submit to him.**

**Exegesis:**
*Grasp* means *hold*.
The Great Symbol is the Dao/Way.
This speaks of rulers holding the Great Dao/Way to govern the world,
With **wuwei** [无为] and **wushi** [无事],
Things fulfill their nature in growth.
Observing the winds and waiting for the sun,
All submit to the ruler of the Dao/Way.
Thus it is said: *All submit.*

**Exegesis (alternate interpretation):**
*Grasp* means *employ*.
The Great Dao/Way is without form,
And cannot be grasped as a possession.
The sage employs the Dao/Way to govern the people,
Acts without **wuwei** [无为],
Yet all—crawling, growing, flying, walking—
Fulfill their nature in life.
Then ships sail swiftly, swift steeds gallop,
Mountains are scaled, multitudes gather,
All submitting to the ruler who employs the Dao/Way.

**Observing the winds and waiting for the sun:**
In ancient times, the **Juyuzhou** [聚窟洲] was in the vast sea,
And its envoys paid tribute to the Han,
Reporting to Emperor Wu:
*"Our land is thirty million *li* distant.
There we always observe the winds and wait for the sun.
If the east wind blows in rhythm,
Hundreds of days without pause,
And the blue clouds ascend unbroken,
Months without dispersal,
Then the Central Kingdom will have a ruler of the Dao/Way."*

Thus the ruler of our land
Looks toward the Central Kingdom,
Admires the Dao/Way’s influence,
Values **lingwu** [灵物] over gold and jade,
And so tames fierce beasts in the **Tianlin** [天林],
Gathers rare treasures and divine fragrances,
Crosses weak waters and shifting sands,
To pay homage at the imperial gate.
Thirteen years of arduous travel!

This is the ruler of the Dao/Way—
His virtue/power moves Heaven,
The winds and clouds respond in omens,
And distant lands yearn for his virtue/power.
All submit without harm,
And so find peace in **Taiping** [Great Harmony].

**Annotation:** When all submit without injury,
They rest in **Taiping** [Great Harmony].

**Exegesis:**
It is said that people from all directions
Yearn for the sage’s rule,
Observe the winds and wait for the sun,
And submit to the sage.
The sage then **gluishui** [绥抚] and nurtures them,
Not enforcing teachings with demands,
Not punishing with laws,
And so the far and near find peace in his **Taiping** governance.

**Taiping** means **harmony and stability**,
**Ping** means **peaceful governance**,
**Harm** means **injury**,
And so when the four directions submit to our virtue/power,
Observe the winds and wait for the sun,
And converge with the sage,
The sage then **gluishui** [绥抚] and nurtures them,
Not enforcing teachings with demands,
Not punishing with laws,
And so the far and near find peace in his **Taiping** governance.

**Peaceful governance and harmony,**
**Stability and ease—**
Then his deeds shine grand,
And so it is called **Taiping**.

*The Analects* say:
*"When distant people do not submit,*
*Cultivate virtue/power and teach to bring them in.*
*Once they have come,*
*Nurture them in peace."*

Thus the imperial Dao/Way and its winds
Reach all, near and far.

**Music and food—**
**Travelers pause to rest.**
**Annotation:** Music gathers with sound,
Food gathers with flavor,
Travelers linger briefly,
Not for long.

Thus the **qilü** [蘧庐] cannot be dwelled in for long,
And those who come with **renyi** [仁义] bring many burdens,
So the ruler embodies the Dao/Way’s **qingjing** [清静],
**Dandan** [淡然] without flavor,
First discarding the **察察** [overt scrutiny] of governance,
Finally transforming the people in **chunchun** [淳淳].
And so the following text concludes: *Its use cannot be exhausted.*

**Exegesis:**
Music is sound,
Food is flavor—
This is a metaphor.
It is said that when the ruler grasps the Great Symbol,
All under Heaven submit to him,
Just as travelers pause when they hear music and taste food.

**Exegesis (alternate interpretation):**
The ruler of the Dao/Way—
All under Heaven yearn for him.
Like travelers who pause when they hear music and taste food,
*The Zhuangzi* [《庄子》] says in the **Zhaile** [至乐] chapter:
*"The music of the **Xianchi** [咸池] and **Jiushao** [九韶] was played in the **Dongting** [洞庭] wilderness,
And when people heard it, they turned back to gaze."*

Music is what all ages have employed,
And when played to symbolize Heaven,
On the **Yuanqiu** [圆丘],
The heavenly spirits descend.

When performed in the marshes, the earth rises in response;
When struck with harmony to the eight winds, it is embraced by the governance of the four seasons.

The Yellow Emperor had the *Xianchi* [咸池],
Yao had the *Dazhang* [大章],
Shun had the *Dasha* [大韶],
Yu had the *Daxia* [大夏],
Tang had the *Dagao* [大濩],
King Wen had the *Biyong* [辟雍],
and King Wu and the Duke of Zhou had the *Dawu* [大武].

Music harmonizes—
And thus, people find peace in their nature,
Which is why it is held in such esteem.

The Sage-King completes his work and creates music,
Establishes order and institutes rites,
Thus communicating with Heaven, Earth, and the spirits.

Yet this metaphor is given—
For the Dao/Way endures eternally.
Music and food are not lasting:
Music delights the ears, but when it ends, the people disperse;
Food pleases the palate, but when eaten, the crowd departs.
Though they may pause for a time,
They cannot be relied upon for permanence.

Only when ruling with *wuwei* [無為] does the people gather and cannot be parted.
When one embodies the Dao/Way in person,
The spirit remains whole and cannot be scattered.

Thus the text continues:
*"The Dao/Way spoken aloud is bland and tasteless,"*
And it is said, *"Its use cannot be exhausted,"*
For it is not like music and food, which have a limit to their enjoyment.

The *Zhunlu* [遵庐] is a thatched hut—
Not a place for long residence.
Ren and righteousness may foster mutual love,
Yet they cannot sustain lasting bonds.
Unlike embodying the Dao/Way and transforming people—
Where the people return to the Dao/Way,
Naturally and enduringly,
How could they ever scatter?

*Cháchá* [察察] is the governance of harsh laws;
*Chúnchún* [淳淳] is the wind of harmonious music.

When the Dao/Way is spoken aloud,
It is bland and without flavor.
**Annotation:**
The ruler teaches through virtue and purity—
When first spoken, the Dao/Way is bland and without taste,
Not like common teachings that carry praise, fear, or reproach.

**Exegesis:**
When the Dao/Way is spoken aloud,
It refers to the ruler’s strict adherence to the methods of virtue and tranquility,
Using *wuwei* [無為] as instruction.
When first spoken, it is bland and without taste—
How could it compare to the allure of common speech,
Which carries praise, fear, or reproach as its flavor?

**Exegesis (alternate interpretation):**
Sweet words and flattering speech—
This is what is called *having flavor*.
The principles of *wuwei*,
The teachings of purity,
The words of the ultimate Dao/Way—
When spoken, they are bland and without taste.
Where is the flavor?

The common teachings of praise and fear—
This is the language of the seventeenth chapter of this text:
*"With sweet words to win affection,
With flattering speech to earn praise,
Or with commands to inspire fear,
Or with insolent words to humiliate."*
Though they may have flavor,
They are not the ultimate Dao/Way.

To look upon it is insufficient to see,
To listen to it is insufficient to hear,
Its use cannot be exhausted.

The Dao/Way, through its tranquil stillness,
Initially requires no spoken teachings.
Thus, it is not seen when viewed,
Nor heard when listened to—
Yet pure winds prevail,
And all things flourish abundantly.

Annual calculations yield surplus,
Hence its use cannot be exhausted.
*Ji* means "exhausted."

The *Cushu* explains:
The Dao’s transformation through *wuwei*,
Dull and even, neither harshly scrutinizing
Nor excessively conspicuous in its decrees—
Thus it is not seen when viewed,
Nor heard when listened to—
Yet annual calculations yield surplus.

Pure winds flow harmoniously,
Cultivated and spontaneous things all thrive,
All beings radiant and prosperous—
Hence its use cannot be exhausted.

The *Yi* states:
The Dao’s wordlessness—
In speech, it has no taste to the palate.
The Dao’s formlessness—
In form, it is unseen by the eye.
The Dao’s soundlessness—
Unheard by the ear.
Thus, chewing reveals no flavor,
Gazing and listening perceive nothing.

It does not impose the rigid urgency of strict laws,
Nor the excessive visibility of proliferating edicts—
Lest it startle the people’s ears and eyes.

When things find their proper place, it is called *pingzhi* (even and straight),
When there is no partiality, it is called *zheng* (upright).
Laws that are overly meticulous are *ke* (harsh),
Taxes and levies imposed too swiftly are *ji* (urgent).
Overly explicit prohibitions are *cháchá* (scrutinizing),
Decrees beyond the law are *zīzhāng* (proliferating).
*Zī* means "many," *zhāng* means "manifest."

Thus, the people’s ears and eyes
Are daily exposed to sights and sounds.
They fear the extravagant, harsh, and violent punishments,
More than they fear stepping on thin ice;
They dread the scrutinizing, proliferating decrees,
More than they fear standing at the edge of a precipice.
Every movement of foot and hand is uncertain—
How can this compare to ruling through the Dao,
Where nothing is seen or heard?
Pure winds act subtly,
All things harmonize effortlessly—
Its use cannot be exhausted.

As for annual calculations yielding surplus,
*Zhuangzi* says:
Old Lao’s disciple, Gengsang Chu,
Obtained the Dao of Old Lao,
And dwelled on the *Yǔlěi* Mountains.
After three years, his people’s customs flourished greatly,
And they said among themselves:
*"When Gengrouzi first arrived,
We were astonished by his transformation.
Now, our daily calculations fall short,
But our annual calculations yield surplus.
Perhaps he is a sage!"*
This speaks of his virtue and grace subtly permeating all things,
Bringing about abundance and flourishing.

How much more so for the Emperor,
Who encompasses the Four Seas,
As the ruler of the world,
Governed through the Dao with effortless ease—
The world is transformed by his influence.
Truly so.

As for those who cultivate the Dao in their own lives:
When the mind harbors no scheming thoughts,
The vital *qi* and spirit remain whole.
When desires and aversions are extinguished,
Love and hatred cease.
Unmoved by sight and sound,
Unperturbed by tranquility,
The profound virtue fills silently—
The Dao may yet be attained.

*Beginning of Volume Twenty-Nine of the Broad Exegesis on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*

**Volume Twenty-Nine begins.**

---

The chapter on *"To Those Who Would Collect"* (Chapter Thirty-Six) elucidates:
The prior chapter expounded the ability to embody the Dao and transform, drawing all to follow.
This chapter reveals that the Dao may employ **strategic measures** (*quan* 权), for when a state’s advantage lies in such measures, they must be kept in reserve—
advantages cannot be openly displayed.

First, it marks the **strategic measures** of contraction and expansion (*xī zhāng* 息張);
Next, it shows the **conduct of yielding and weakness** (*róu ruò* 柔弱);
Finally, it concludes with the parable of the **deep-sea fish** (*yuān yú* 淵魚),
To illustrate the signs of **strategic measures** in the Dao.

**Its meaning is this:**
The Dao’s transformation adapts to circumstances and responds to opportunity.
In the **Age of High Antiquity**, the sovereign entrusted himself to the Dao,
The ministers enriched themselves in **virtue** (*dé* 德),
And the people flourished in **harmony** (*hé* 和).
Thus, their actions were unseen, their words unheard,
Their governance complete without trace.

Yet as time passed, the **virtue** of the age grew thin and shallow,
Customs declined into error,
The profound mysteries of the Dao became obscure,
The rare and subtle were beyond measure.

When the Sage sought to restore simplicity and purity,
To abruptly discard the ornate and excessive,
To silence the clamor of voices,
To search for truth in distant reaches—
He taught the rulers of the age,
To grasp the **strategic measures** of transformation,
To demonstrate the **gates of contraction and expansion** (*xiē liǎn kāi zhāng* 息敛開張),
To curb deceit,
To reverse the **usurpation of power** and the **abandonment of merit** (*yǔ duó fèi xīng* 與奪廢興),
And to restrain corruption.

Thus, deceitful men may return to loyalty,
And wayward men may return to rectitude.

Though these **strategic measures** are not the ultimate truth,
They serve as auxiliary methods.

Hence, they are called **advantages** for the state.

Those who wield such advantages,
Like those who use armies and chariots,
Do so only when necessity demands.

They must conduct themselves with **yielding and weakness**,
Subtly reveal the **principles** (*jī* 機),
And not display their **strategic measures** to the unworthy.

As fish cannot lose water—
Fish lose water and die—
Men lose opportunity and are ruined.
The *Book of the Unadorned* (*Sùshū* 素書) states:
*"He who leaks his schemes is doomed to fail."*
The *Yijing* (*易*) says:
*"If the opportunity is not kept secret, it brings harm to oneself."*
This is precisely what is meant.

To those who would **collect** (*xiē* 息),
They must first **expand** (*zhāng* 張);
To those who would **weaken** (*ruò* 弱),
They must first **strengthen** (*qiáng* 強);
To those who would **abolish** (*fèi* 廢),
They must first **promote** (*xīng* 興);
To those who would **usurp** (*duó* 奪),
They must first **bestow** (*yǔ* 與).

**Commentary:**
*Xiē* (息) means **contraction** (*liǎn* 敛).

This reveals how the Sage employs **strategic measures** in the Dao
To transform and guide all beings.

Since men possess **blunt roots** (*dùn gēn* 鈍根) and **sharp roots** (*lì gēn* 利根),
Teaching must include both **strategic measures** (*quan* 权) and **substantial truth** (*shí* 實).

The Sage desires to measure the roots of men’s nature,
Thus he uses **strategic measures** and **substantial truth** in alternation to clarify their responses.

Men with **sharp roots** perceive goodness and turn from it,
See faults and amend them.
A mere hint of guidance suffices,
For they deeply grasp the **origin of roots**.

**Its meaning is this:**
The Sage establishes teachings,
Dividing them into two **gates**: **strategic measures** and **substantial truth**.

The **superior man** with a **sharp root** understands the **substantial truth** fully.
The **middle and inferior men** require the **gate of strategic measures**.
The methods of **strategic measures** are vast and varied.
According to the Classic’s judgment,
They may be broadly categorized into four **gates**.

**Roots** refer to the **roots of wisdom and nature** (*zhìxìng zhī gēn* 智性之根).
What men inherit is the **true primordial Dao-nature** (*zhēnyuán dào xìng* 真元道性),
Which generates all wisdom.
Like the roots of grasses and trees,
They produce blossoms and fruit,
Mutually giving rise—
Hence they are called **roots**.

The generation of wisdom from nature is likewise so.
What men inherit in nature is their **qi**.
There are **pure and impure** distinctions.
Men whose **qi** is pure and harmonious
Generate **sharp roots** naturally—
Their talents and wisdom surpass others,
Their understanding spans ancient and modern,
And when asked one thing, they know ten.

Since such men possess **sharp roots**,
They perceive and act with clarity—
They advance when opportunity arises,
Retreat when difficulties mount,
Pursue goodness as if fearing to miss it,
And recoil from evil as if touching scalding water.
Thus, they turn from goodness when they see it,
And amend their faults when they encounter them.
They grasp the **methods of expedient means** (*fāngbiàn* 方便),
And know the **paths of progress**.
Without awaiting the Dao’s **strategic measures** to lure them,
They naturally attain the **substantial truth** of its teachings.

The four **gates** are **contraction, weakness, abolition, and usurpation** (*xiē ruò fèi duó* 息弱廢奪).

**Commentary:**
Men with **blunt roots** are confused and stagnant for long.
Unless **strategic measures** are employed to transform them,
They cannot be led to follow.

Thus, to those who would **collect** and **contract** their desires,
First **expand** and **display** their extravagant hearts,
So they become ensnared in love and desire—
Then they will naturally **contract** and **restrain**.

The same applies to **strengthening and weakening**.
Extend this reasoning universally,
And it holds true without exception.

At first hearing, one may think this contradicts the Dao’s intent.
But when one penetrates to its **profound depths**,
Then the **origin of strategic measures** becomes clear.
Hence the annotation states:
*"The gentleman employs strategic measures, valuing their alignment with righteousness;
The petty man uses them, resorting to deceit."*

The later passage states:
*"They cannot be openly displayed,"*
Precisely because **strategic measures** in the Dao are difficult to grasp.

**Its meaning is this:**
Men with **blunt roots** whose **qi** is impure and mixed
Generate **obtuse and dull** nature—
Their wisdom is blocked, their understanding clouded,
They cannot distinguish right from wrong,
Much less know good and evil.
Some are greedy and cruel,
Following their desires without restraint,
Their actions always leading to guilt,
Their lives forever estranged from others.

The Sage is always good at rescuing beings,
Compassionate toward all life,
Thus he demonstrates the **gate of strategic measures**,
To guide them toward self-awareness.

Hence the four **gates** of **strategic measures** are employed to transform them.
The first—*"To those who would collect, they must first expand"*—
**Contracts** their hearts.
The second—*"To those who would weaken, they must first strengthen"*—
**Contracts** their nature.
The third—*"To those who would abolish, they must first promote"*—
**Contracts** their desires.
The fourth—*"To those who would usurp, they must first bestow"*—
**Contracts** their greed.

When the heart is **frugal**, the Dao is **buried** (*zàng* 葬);
When the heart is **extravagant**, faults arise.
By indulging in extravagance and gaining faults,
They naturally reflect and attain **frugality**.
This is the **strategic measure** of **contracting** the heart.

When nature is **weak**, **virtue** is **whole** (*quán* 全);
When nature is **strong**, disaster arises.
By indulging in strength and inviting disaster,
They naturally reflect and return to **weakness**.
This is the **strategic measure** of **yielding** to subdue strength.

When desires are **few**, conduct is **pure** (*qīng* 清);
When desires are **many**, the spirit becomes **impure**.
Deep desires lead to extreme impurity,
Yet they naturally reflect and return to **purity**.
This is the **strategic measure** of **abolishing** desires to **purify** the spirit.

When greed is **nonexistent**, one is **frugal** (*jiǎn yuē* 俭約);
When greed is **extreme**, calamity befalls oneself.
By indulging in greed and suffering calamity,
They naturally reflect and return to **frugality**.
This is the **strategic measure** of **cultivating frugality** to **usurp** greed.

All these methods first **expand** their extravagant hearts,
So they become ensnared in their own desires—
Then they reflect upon their nature and **cultivate** the Dao.

At first hearing, one may think this contradicts the principle of **non-action** and **spontaneous transformation**,
Yet there are distinctions between **sharp and blunt roots**,
And differences in the **gradual and sudden** paths to enlightenment.

Sudden enlightenment requires no reliance on expedient means,
While gradual transformation depends on skillful guidance.
Thus arises the distinction between expedient and fundamental truth.

The Dao of expedients teaches humanity,
Yet all must ultimately conform to the Great Principle—
Hence its emphasis on aligning with righteousness.

The petty-minded trifle with expedients through deceit,
And thus they must not be lightly shown to those unaligned with the Way.

The *Analects* says: *"One may stand with him, but not employ expedients with him."*
This speaks to the difficulty of using expedients.

The *Yinfu* states: *"The virtuous man, when he gains it, endures adversity;
The petty man, when he gains it, risks his life."*
Is this not what is meant?

This is called **subtle clarity**.

**Note:** The scripture says, *"Right speech seems reversed,"*
And the *Yijing* says, *"The compliant one acts through expedients."*
Expedients are those that reverse the norm yet align with righteousness.

Thus, the virtuous employ expedients by aligning with righteousness,
While the petty misuse them for deceit.

Confucius said: *"One may stand with him, but not employ expedients with him."*
Hence, the Master Lao previously demonstrated **embracing the Great Image**—this is the fundamental truth—
And now follows with **contraction and expansion**, which is the expedient.

To measure the capacities of all beings,
He employs expedients and fundamental truths to reveal their true nature,
So they may inevitably attain the realm of **nature and fate**.

Yet the confused claim this contradicts the **Dao and virtue**—
How deeply they err and fail to awaken!

To contract and restrain the desires of all beings,
First expand their extravagant hearts,
So they become ensnared in their own loves—
Then contraction follows naturally.

The principles of strength and weakness are similarly applied here.
This Dao is subtle, yet its effects are clearly manifest—
Hence it is called **subtle clarity**.

**Commentary:** The Dao of expedients subtly transforms.
Examining its application reveals its effects clearly—
Thus it is called **subtle clarity**.

**Explanation:** The Dao of expedients is most subtle;
When applied, its effects become evident.
Assessing its results proves its efficacy—
**Manifest** is the same as **clear**.

The Sage directs the thoughts of superior disciples toward the **Mystic Burial** of non-action,
In harmony with the ultimate Dao.
Yet why employ expedients and fundamental truths for them?

Expedients are established for those of middling and inferior wisdom.
It is like the art of war:
The superior strategist defeats through foresight,
Without raising an army—
Planning victories from afar,
Deciding battles a thousand *li* away,
While the inferior lack understanding of adaptability,
Waiting for battle to erupt—
Some sever necks, others split livers—
Only then do they discern victory or defeat,
And deliberate on advance or retreat.

Such ignorance of adaptability
Demands that expedient methods be shown to them,
So they may learn from expedients to correct themselves—
Thus no one is abandoned.

*"The compliant one acts through expedients,"*
And the meaning of *"one may stand with him"* has been explained elsewhere.

**The yielding overcomes the rigid.**

**Note:** The compliant and yielding can act through expedients.
When expedients are applied, they can control others.
Thus, the yielding and weak can overcome the rigid and strong.

**Commentary:** The *Yijing* says, *"The compliant one acts through expedients."*
This clarifies that compliance and humility enable one to act through expedients.
Thus, to contract, first expand;
To weaken, first strengthen—
Yet ultimately, they will contract and weaken,
This is the Dao of yielding,
Which can conquer the rigid and strong.

**Explanation:** The *Yijing* [missing character] says, *"The compliant one acts through expedients."*
**Compliance** means **yielding and humility**—
When one can yield to circumstances and act appropriately,
Then expedients can be applied.
If one cannot adapt to change, expedients cannot be employed.

**Compliance** is **harmonization** and **yielding**.
The southeast hexagram, at the intersection of spring and summer,
When the Dipper points southeast—
All things are purified and harmonized.
**Compliance** governs clarifying and promulgating decrees,
To establish laws—
Hence it is called *"the restraint of the compliant virtue."*

Again, **compliance** governs the wind—
The emperor’s decrees, like the wind’s movement,
Can proclaim edicts without boasting,
Remaining hidden and unassuming.
Thus it is said: *"The compliant proclaims yet conceals."*

From this, we see **compliance** embodies:
Yielding, purity, concealment, and non-arrogance.
With these four virtues,
And the ability to issue commands and adapt to circumstances,
Only then can one act through expedients.

From this perspective, the Dao of expedients must not be lightly discussed.
If one aligns with righteousness and acts accordingly,
They can transform vice into virtue,
Prosper the nation, and benefit the people.
If not, they harm nature, injure the body,
And ultimately become deceitful.

When a ruler teaches the wild and wicked to use expedients for adaptability,
Yet governs with yielding and humility,
The rigid and strong will all submit to his gentle virtue.

Fish cannot be removed from the depths,
And a nation’s sharp weapons must not be shown to others.

**Note:** *Det* means **loss**.
**Sharp weapons** refer to **expedients**.
This warns that expedients must not be revealed to the unworthy.

**Commentary:** *Det* means **loss**.
**Sharp weapons** are **expedients**.
Fish in water are like a ruler wielding expedients—
If fish lose water, they are captured by men,
And if expedients are revealed to the unworthy,
The petty will seize and misuse them for deceit.

**Explanation:** Fish in the depths—
If they lose water, they die;
If they retain water, they live.
A ruler using expedients—
If applied to the worthy, they bring benefit;
If misapplied, they bring ruin.

Fish can hide in deep pools,
Avoid bait, and refuse hooks—
Thus they avoid losing water.
A ruler can employ the worthy,
Delegate to the loyal,
Exile the deceitful,
And block treacherous paths—
Thus they avoid losing expedients.

If fish lose water, they are captured by men;
If a ruler loses expedients, the petty gain power.
Those who steal a ruler’s expedients and manipulate them
Will invert black and white,
Turn good into evil,
Unleash their wickedness,
And indulge in cruelty.

Thus, the **Jizhu** overthrew the legitimate heir to establish a concubine’s son,
And destroyed the **Muzi** clan’s reputation;
**Zhao Gao** slandered the loyal and harmed the virtuous,
And destroyed the **Qin ancestral foundation**.

The people suffer its calamities,
And the common folk resent their ruler—
When the people scatter and the state is in peril,
There is no hope of salvation.

The *Shuowen Jiezi* says: **"Deceit" (诈) is "to deceive."**
**"Guile" (谲) is to mislead the world with falsehoods.**

Guile, as in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*—
When Duke Wen of Jin provoked楚 to anger and war,
He captured the Lord of曹 and humbled himself before宋,
And楚 indeed attacked宋.
Duke Wen then turned to fight楚,
And the楚 army was routed.
Duke Wen then summoned King Shou of Zhou to河阳,
Presenting him to the assembled lords,
And had the king go on a hunt.
Thus, he united the lords under the pretense of honoring the Son of Heaven,
Yet secretly feared Zhou’s strength and dared not pay homage.
He feigned the Son of Heaven’s hunting expedition,
Gaining the opportunity to perform all the rites of君臣—
All these were guileful and improper acts.

Confucius said: **"To summon a君 as a臣 is unteachable."**
Thus the records say: **"The Son of Heaven hunted at河阳."**
This was not his proper domain.
Even this is called guileful deception—
How much more so when treacherous ministers and petty men manipulate power to deceive their ruler,
And do not heed warnings until they regret it?

Those who cultivate the Dao:
Within, they rectify their heart;
Without, they rectify their conduct.
Inner and outer as one,
Upright and without deceit,
Then their thoughts and intentions may resonate with the True Spirit.
But if their words and deeds contradict,
And they are crooked and improper,
Though they bow and stretch, adorn their appearance—
It is all in vain.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao Ever Does Nothing**

**Commentary:**
The previous chapter showed how the Dao may employ expedients,
Illustrating the gathering and dispersing of the state of卫.
This chapter clarifies that expedients must align with righteousness,
To govern the unrefined essence (*pu*).
Thus, the Dao does nothing—
If lords and kings uphold it, transformation occurs naturally.
The unrefined essence, without desire,
Allows the world to settle and purify itself.

Laozi expounds this to clarify the ineffable,
Teaching while desiring to transcend teaching.
Thus, this chapter unfolds in the *Daodejing*’s upper sections,
Addressing those who grasp the mysterious enlightenment.

**Meaning:**
The ruler’s governance of the world
Uses genuine teaching to rectify the君子,
Expedients to subdue the petty,
And the Dao of non-action to harmonize both teachings,
Making them the foundation of transformation.

Genuine teaching means:
君 as君,臣 as臣,父 as父,子 as子—
Ritual, music, benevolence, and trust
To rectify all under heaven.
The ruler and君子 practice and uphold these,
Establishing laws for the four seas.

The petty, when advancing, do not embrace benevolence and righteousness,
And when retreating, fall into legal punishments.
If not guided by expedient methods to turn their evil to good,
And instead sink into ruin—
This is abandonment.

Laozi said: **"No one abandons people."**
Thus, expedient methods are set to teach them,
To return them to goodness,
And to universally benefit the world—
All may then recover their unrefined essence.

The unrefined essence is the wondrous origin of the Dao.
If lords and kings uphold and apply it,
All things transform naturally.
If they desire to alter this,
They must always govern with non-action,
And the world will settle and rectify itself.

Those who cultivate the Dao:
The Sage employs profound techniques to cultivate,
While the world is easily misled.
Thus, they establish rules, warnings, and models to rectify outward conduct;
They record meditative concentration and spiritual refinement to rectify the heart;
They refine qi and nurture the primordial embryo to regulate diet;
They offer prayers and thanks to the True One to purge transgressions.
Then, they pursue the path of *learning without learning*,
Attaining silent stillness,
Dwelling in the realm of *less and yet less*,
And aligning with non-action.
Thus, the gates of errant paths remain closed,
And the pure harmony of tranquility is achieved.

The Dao ever does nothing, yet nothing is left undone.

**Commentary:**
The Dao’s nature is pure and tranquil,
Its wondrous origin profound and still—
Thus, it ever does nothing.
All things rely on it to flourish and take form,
Responding to stimuli with certainty—
Thus, it does nothing yet leaves nothing undone.
What is done has limits to what is not done,
Thus, what is not done encompasses all.

**Meaning:**
The Dao’s nature is unadulterated, truly one and empty—
Thus, it is pure and tranquil.
Its depth is unfathomable, like a clear spring—
Thus, it is profound and still.
Silent and unmoving—this is non-action.
Responsive yet effortless—this is doing nothing yet leaving nothing undone.

Non-action is the essence of the wondrous origin.
Doing nothing yet leaving nothing undone is its function.
Essence and function interdependently give rise to all transformations.
If it cannot be penetrated or respond,
If it is silent yet formless,
Unable to generate—
Though it does nothing, how can it benefit the mysterious transformation?

If, instead, it cycles endlessly,
Acting without rest,
Exhausted and ceaseless—
This is mere doing—
Where can it find repose?

One must act yet do nothing to govern movement,
Do nothing yet act to regulate stillness,
Never straying from the true Dao,
Never obstructed by deceit—
Only then can one speak of the source of purity and tranquility.

If lords and kings uphold it,
All things will transform naturally.

**Note:**
The wondrous origin is pure and tranquil—
Thus, it ever does nothing.
Things rely on it to flourish,
Yet it leaves nothing undone.
If lords and kings uphold the Dao of non-action,
All things will transform naturally.
The ruler’s non-action makes the people pure and unrefined.

**Commentary:**
If lords and kings uphold the Dao of purity and tranquility,
Doing nothing yet leaving nothing undone,
All things will naturally transform and purify themselves—
This is the ruler’s good governance and the people’s purity.

**Meaning:**
The ruler governs all under heaven,
The lord governs his state—
If all uphold the Dao of non-action and purity,
Transformation arises from below,
While the lord remains tranquil above.
This is the ultimate principle.

Teaching leads to transformation—this is guided transformation.
Not teaching yet transforming—this is self-transformation.
Teaching and transforming means doing nothing yet able to transform things.
Not teaching yet transforming means non-action leading to natural attainment of transformation.

When transformation arises and desires to act,
I will govern it with the nameless unrefined essence.

**Note:**
Once people follow the ruler’s transformation,
Already in non-action and purity,
Yet still desire to move and act—
I will govern them with the nameless unrefined essence to tranquilize them.

The nameless unrefined essence is the Dao.

The *Commentary* explains:

The nameless unrefined essence is the Dao.
Those who act are those who move and engage in deliberate action.
*"I"* refers to the sovereign’s self-designation.
It states that when people receive virtuous teaching and transform,
the ruler’s virtue is in non-action and purity.
Yet if they still desire to move and act deliberately,
I will use the nameless unrefined essence to tranquilize them,
so that they remain pure and unmoving.

The meaning is this:
When the Dao is applied, it is given a strong name.
Returning to the unrefined essence means abandoning traces—
the essence is nameless.
The sovereign transforms people through the Dao,
and those who receive this transformation are all pure and tranquil.
If they are again drawn by external influences,
and their desires stir them to act,
the sovereign will use the Dao’s subtle origin—the formless, nameless unrefined essence—to tranquilize their minds,
preventing deliberate action,
so that they always align with the Dao’s pure transformation.

When cultivating the Dao,
if the mind merges and the spirit stills,
yet worldly delusions arise and external thoughts suddenly emerge,
leading one toward agitation or entanglement in disputes,
one should urgently retreat to a quiet chamber,
reflect on the profound and ponder the true,
using the Dao of non-action to tranquilize the mind and suppress false thoughts.
Like muddy water gradually clarifying,
the Three Corpses cannot disturb,
a hundred evils cannot unsettle,
and all demonic trials cease,
ascending to the stage of emptiness.
The nameless unrefined essence will also cease to be desired.

The *Commentary* continues:
Earlier, it spoke of common people desiring to act deliberately—
the ruler would use the nameless unrefined essence to tranquilize them.
Now it says that even the nameless unrefined essence itself should not be clung to.
For if one clings to the nameless,
traces will arise,
causing these beings to lose their origin and return to deliberate action—
no different from their original desires.

The meaning is this:
Once people have transformed into purity yet still act deliberately,
it is due to accumulated habits and prolonged confusion.
Like water that is hard to clarify but easily muddied,
nature that is hard to purify but easily obscured,
the mind that is hard to still but easily agitated,
or resolve that is hard to sustain but easily abandoned—
the sovereign must use the essence’s subtle origin to tranquilize and still them.
Once stillness is achieved,
one must further abandon all clinging,
until all traces are extinguished,
then the mind becomes profoundly silent and intuitively clear,
penetrating true mystery,
so that beings do not cling to traces,
and sages do not cling to emptiness.
With both emptiness and being forgotten,
one attains perfect observation.

The *Commentary* explains:
Thus, initially, the nameless unrefined essence is used
to tranquilize the people’s restless desires.
Once the people’s desires are removed,
the sage’s nameless essence is also abandoned.
It is like medicine curing illness—
when the illness is gone, the medicine is forgotten;
or a boat ferrying across water—
when the crossing is complete, the boat is left behind.
If one clings to the boat after crossing,
or continues taking medicine after recovery,
not only will one fail to reach the other shore,
but new afflictions will arise.

The meaning is this:
Having attained stillness in human nature,
one must further abandon the nameless.
Like forgetting the boat after crossing,
or the medicine after recovery—
this is the essence of true cultivation.

Boats and medicines are metaphors for teaching.
Beings cycle through the world’s entanglements,
confused by the duality of existence and emptiness,
gradually stained by the six dusts,
dragged by attachments into suffering.
The Venerable Master expounds the precepts of non-action,
narrates the great function of salvation,
and presents this true scripture as the supreme medicine for curing afflictions.
Through the scripture’s awakening,
delusions naturally disperse,
internal stains are washed clean,
external entanglements are severed,
and with afflictions healed and worldly bonds dissolved,
one must abandon teaching and forget words,
merging back into the Dao.

Moreover, the world’s sufferings,
the cycle of birth and death,
the wandering of true essence,
the sinking of pure nature—
are like drowning in the vast sea.
Beings follow currents and drift with waves,
with no way to transcend.
The Venerable Master, through this profound scripture,
governs the realm and saves people,
rescuing all beings from the sea of desire.
Through the scripture, they are delivered—
like a great vessel cutting across rapid currents,
ascending to the other shore,
where desire-waves cannot shake their nature,
and love-tides cannot drown their minds.
They exit the court of accumulated suffering
and step into the domain of eternal life.
Having crossed, one must forget the vessel they rode,
abandon the path they followed,
rest the spirit in the realm of nothingness,
and wander the heart’s natural home—
this is to preserve the true in emptiness,
contain all things in purity,
manifesting humanity while embodying the heavens,
floating effortlessly in harmony,
truly trusting in nature alone.

If one clings to the vessel or the medicine,
failing to transcend and instead generating new afflictions—
this is no idle warning.

*"Not desiring"* leads to stillness,
and the world will naturally align.
*Note:*
When the sovereign uses the nameless unrefined essence to tranquilize the people,
they must not cling to this nameless essence,
lest they seek traces and lose their origin,
returning to deliberate action.
Thus, even the nameless unrefined essence must be forgotten.
Not desiring to desire,
desire itself is forgotten—
tranquil and pure,
the world will naturally align.

The *Commentary* states:
When the nameless unrefined essence is no longer desired,
and the desire for non-desire is also forgotten,
then tranquil and pure—
this is called *liberation*.
The ruler governs through non-action, attaining supreme order above,
while people follow their nature, transforming below.
No decrees are needed, yet the world is rectified and peaceful.
Thus it is said: *"The world will naturally align."*

The meaning is this:
Once the people’s restless desires are stilled,
and the metaphors of boat and medicine are forgotten,
the nameless unrefined essence is also abandoned,
and even the desire for non-desire is extinguished—
then emptiness and being are transcended,
vast and unobstructed.
The ruler above speaks without words, yet is trusted.
The people below transform without instruction, yet act rightly.
Speaking without words is governing through non-action above.
Transforming without instruction is following nature below.
When transformation reaches this point,
what need is there for decrees?
The world is rectified and peaceful,
returning to the Dao of antiquity.

「The *Dao* is the essence of *virtue*, and *virtue* is the manifestation of the *Dao*.
Thus it is said: *"The chapter first marks the name of virtue’s function, intending to reveal the transformation of virtue’s completeness."*

When *virtue* is complete, the pure and unrefined essence does not disperse, and there are no traces of artificial influence.
If the *Dao* is neglected, then benevolence and righteousness will prevail, and the people will suffer from superficial corruption.
To restore the original state, the Sage first expounds on the *Dao*’s non-action of supreme *virtue*,
then describes the retreat of benevolence and righteousness,
and concludes with "discarding ornament and embracing reality" to lead them back to simplicity and purity.

○ *Explanation*: The *Dao* is the substance of *virtue*, and *virtue* is the function of the *Dao*.
Hence, *"the chapter first marks the name of virtue’s function, pointing to supreme virtue."*

Supreme *virtue* is the *virtue* that does not rely on *virtue*—
it is the means by which *virtue* is fully realized.
When supreme *virtue* is complete, the pure and unrefined essence does not disperse.
The pure and unrefined essence undispersed means that *virtue* and transformation merge indistinguishably,
like fish in the waters, each fulfilling its nature—
thus there are no traces of mutual reliance or artificial influence.

Next, it states that when *virtue* is lost, benevolence and righteousness arise instead.
Benevolence carries the bias of partial affection,
and righteousness imposes rigid distinctions—
thus the people follow their ruler, yet become superficial and corrupted.

When elaborate customs become excessive and formal rituals grow chaotic,
their proliferation worsens, and disputes inevitably flourish.
Therefore, the Sage seeks to return to the original state,
discarding ornament and embracing reality—
this is to block the source of chaos and reopen the gate to simplicity.
Hence it is said: *"To restore them to simplicity and purity."*

Supreme *virtue* does not rely on *virtue*—
yet it is *virtue* itself.
*Explanation*: "Supreme" refers to the early ages.
*Virtue* is the manifestation of the *Dao*.
It is said that in the ancient past, simplicity and purity were the natural order,
and the sovereigns who embodied the *Dao* entrusted all to spontaneous manifestation—
this was the supreme *virtue* of antiquity, hence *"supreme virtue."*

The profoundest *virtue* operates silently,
beyond human naming,
hence *"does not rely on virtue."*
The wind of purity was harmonious,
all things flourished naturally,
and *virtue*’s function remained ever complete—
hence *"yet it is virtue."*

*Commentary* says: *"The term ‘virtue’ refers to the spontaneous manifestation of things,"*
a phrase from the *Zhuangzi*’s miscellaneous chapters.

*Explanation*: The text raises the complete *virtue* of the ancient sovereigns,
who did not regard *virtue* as *virtue*—
yet it was *virtue*.
This introduces the decline of later ages, thus beginning with supreme *virtue*.

In the age of the profoundest *Dao*,
*virtue* was not openly displayed.
The sovereign of supreme *virtue* was akin to the *"Supreme"* sovereign of the *Upper Scripture*—
silently merging with the utmost transformation,
all things spontaneously manifested,
without the sovereign’s *virtue* being openly proclaimed—
yet his *virtue* shone all the brighter,
hence *"yet it is virtue."*

However, the *Dao* and *virtue* that all things under heaven inherit
have the *Dao* as their root and *virtue* as their beginning.
The *Dao* varies in depth,
hence there is the *Dao* that can be spoken of and the constant *Dao*;
*Virtue* varies in richness,
hence there is supreme *virtue* and lesser *virtue*.
Thus, the *Dao* and *virtue* are not confined to emperors alone.
Those who practice the *Dao* are *Dao* practitioners,
those who practice *virtue* are *virtue* practitioners—
their depth differs, hence the distinction between supreme and lesser.

*Zhuangzi* says:
*"To be empty and do nothing,
opening the *Dao* for all things—
this is called a *Dao* practitioner.
To be serene and respond naturally—
this is called a *virtue* practitioner."*

*Virtue* has degrees of excellence,
the world experiences flourishing and decline—
thus when the sovereign of supreme *virtue* merges with transformation,
embodies the *Dao* and remains,
his *virtue* moves through the mysteries of the unseen,
and all under heaven turn to him,
without seeing or hearing him.
When *virtue* returns to all things,
they all say it is natural—
hence *"The Supreme holds *virtue* in highest esteem."*

*Zhuangzi*’s miscellaneous chapters state:
*"All things follow their natural course,
each attaining its own life—
this is what is called *virtue*."*

「Thus, those who grasp the *Dao* possess complete *virtue*,
those with complete *virtue* preserve their form,
those who preserve their form attain fullness of spirit,
and this is the *Dao* of the Sage.

The lesser *virtue* does not lose its *virtue*,
yet it is called *without virtue*.
**Annotation:** *Virtue* is the application of the *Dao*.

*Zhuangzi* says:
*"All things attain life through *virtue*—
this is called *virtue*.
Yet *virtue* has degrees of excellence,
so its application varies in rank.
In the days of old, *virtue* was pure and unadorned,
its application not manifest,
no *virtue* to be praised—
thus it is called *without virtue*.
Yet pure *virtue* does not disperse,
and through non-action, its essence remains clear—
thus it is called *possessing virtue* after all.
When *virtue* declines below,
its functions become slightly apparent,
though the heart still embodies the *Dao*,
its traces lean toward action.
Since *virtue* can now be named,
it is called *not losing virtue*.
Yet when traces lean toward ostentation,
it is coarser than the *virtue* of the Supreme,
thus it is called *without virtue* after all.

**Exegesis:** This speaks of how pure customs gradually fade,
and *virtue* declines accordingly.
Thus, the Sage praises the wind of non-action,
while common folk still follow its traces.
To follow traces is inferior,
hence *lesser virtue*.
When traces become apparent,
*virtue* can be named—
thus *not losing virtue*.
Though *virtue* is named and not lost,
its traces lean toward ostentation,
and ostentation with adherence
is far from the *Dao*.
Since it has traces of action,
compared to the *virtue* of the Supreme Sage,
it is *without virtue* indeed.

The *virtue* of the Supreme Sage is non-action yet without pretense of non-action.
**Annotation:** Those who know non-action as beautiful
yet practice non-action are not yet perfect.
But those who practice non-action
without pretense of knowing its beauty—
this is perfection.
Thus, the non-action of Supreme *virtue*
is not feigned for its beauty,
but simply contains and nurtures purity,
naturally arriving at non-action.
Thus it is said: *non-action yet without pretense of non-action*.
This is the heart and trace both in non-action.

**Exegesis:** This elucidates Supreme *virtue*.
The Supreme Sage’s *virtue* operates subtly,
achieving harmony through non-action,
purity never dispersing—
thus no name or trace.
Now, when speaking of Supreme *virtue*’s non-action,
it is only that purity is contained and nurtured,
naturally arriving at non-action,
not that it knows non-action as beautiful
and thus practices it.
Hence it is said: *non-action yet without pretense of non-action*.
Not only does it lack traces to boast of,
but the heart itself transforms without effort.
Thus the **Annotation** says: *This is the heart and trace both in non-action*.

**Exegesis:** The Sage of Supreme *virtue*,
whose nature aligns with the *Dao* and whose fate harmonizes with the One,
embodies naturalness as function,
operates the Great Unity as spirit,
moves in accord with Heaven,
rests in accord with Earth,
and thus finds perfect resonance with the *Dao*—
without doing anything.
The Sage whose spirit has no thought,
whose will has no concern—
this is the heart’s non-action.
Not displaying its function,
yet its function is like that of Heaven and Earth,
not proclaiming its brilliance,
yet its brilliance rivals the sun and moon—
this is the trace’s non-action.
This non-action is not feigned,
imitating the beauty of non-action while practicing it—
it is truly *without pretense of non-action*.
The *Dao* employs yin and yang as its agents,
the spirits and gods as its strategists;
advancing and retreating, shifting and yielding,
it blends with transformation without end,
mysteriously silent and boundless,
yet moving with transformation as one—
this is called the heart and trace both in non-action.

Yet *virtue*’s nourishing embrace of all things
is also how its traces become manifest.

The lesser *virtue* acts yet has pretense of non-action.
**Annotation:** Those who practice lesser *virtue* act,
for though the heart lacks the brilliance of function,
its traces involve action—
thus it is said: *acts yet has pretense of non-action*.
This speaks of lesser *virtue*’s non-action
having a reason for its existence.
This is the heart in non-action,
while the traces are in action.

**Exegesis:** This elucidates lesser *virtue*.
Those who practice lesser *virtue* act,
for though the heart admires non-action’s transformation,
it still practices this non-action—
thus it is said: *acts yet has pretense of non-action*.
Though the heart is said to be in non-action,
when examining its traces,
they involve ostentation and effort.
Thus it is said: *while the traces are in action*.
**Annotation:** This is the heart in non-action,
while the traces are in action.

**Exegesis:** In ancient times, when *virtue* declined,
the heart and traces became clear and apparent.
The sovereign knew that action was wrong,
that non-action was right—
action made things shallow,
non-action made them pure and harmonious.
With this distinction,
he concealed his heart and hid his function,
practiced non-action’s affairs,
and restrained action’s *doings*—
thus it is said: *acts yet has pretense of non-action*.
His heart desired non-action,
wandering in non-action,
yet in traces, he still leaned toward ostentation.
Knowing non-action as beautiful,
action as evil,
he abandoned evil for good,
admiring non-action’s distinction—
thus it is said: *there is a reason for this action*.
Hence, when speaking of Supreme Benevolence,
though it acts, it has no pretense of non-action.

**Annotation:** Benevolence is the name for universal love.
When lesser *virtue* declines and Supreme Benevolence appears,
it is the universal love of Benevolence—
thus it is said: *acts yet has pretense of non-action*.
To practice Benevolence while forgetting Benevolence,
this is also to seek non-action—
yet the heart still has deeds to attend to.
Though traces approach non-action,
this is the heart in action,
while the traces are in non-action.

**Exegesis:** Though Supreme Benevolence is named for non-action,
it is based on the desire for non-action
while still adhering to its principles—
it cannot yet speak to lesser *virtue*’s action.
**Exegesis:** This clarifies how, when the *Dao*’s practice fades,
Benevolence and righteousness are then upheld.

Supreme Benevolence is said to act yet have no pretense of non-action.
**Annotation:** Benevolence is the name for universal love,
and when lesser *virtue* declines while Supreme Benevolence appears,
it is the universal love of Benevolence—
thus it is said: *acts yet has pretense of non-action*.
To practice Benevolence while forgetting Benevolence,
though there is giving, there is no expectation of return—
yet universal love is hard to achieve,
and ultimately, it remains limited kindness without trust.
Thus, though the heart is always engaged in affairs,
it is said: *acts yet has pretense of non-action*.
When examining its traces,
they are close to non-action—
thus it is said: *while there is no pretense of non-action*.
**Annotation:** This is the heart in action,
while the traces are in non-action.

**Exegesis:** Benevolence is the name for universal love.
The practice of the Great *Dao* favors no private gain,
and as pure customs fade,
universal love naturally emerges.
Now, it is clarified why this is called Benevolence’s universal love—
thus it is said: *Supreme Benevolence acts yet has pretense of non-action*.
To practice Benevolence while forgetting Benevolence,
though giving exists, there is no demand for repayment—
yet universal love is difficult to realize,
and it remains limited kindness without sincerity.
Thus, though the heart is always in action,
it is said: *acts yet has pretense of non-action*.
When examining its traces,
they are close to non-action—
thus it is said: *while there is no pretense of non-action*.
**Annotation:** This is the heart in action,
while the traces are in non-action.

**Exegesis:** Benevolence is the name for universal love.
The *Book of Plainness* says:
*"Benevolence is what people cherish,
possessing a heart of compassionate kindness and pity,
to nurture all things to their fullness—
this is Benevolence."*

The Benevolent one, in bestowing broadly upon all things,
is the very source of partiality.
When compared to **virtue/power (德)**, it is inferior.

In the age of the **Dao/Way (至道)**, all actions are encompassed,
without partiality or distinction—
thus it is silent, tranquil, and boundless.
That which gives birth yet does not govern is the **Dao/Way (道)**.
All things receive its transformation and attain their own fulfillment—this is **virtue/power (德)**.
To complete, to mature, to nourish, and to cultivate—this is **Benevolence (仁)**.
Birds and beasts, plants and movement—
each fulfills its proper nature—this is **Righteousness (义)**.
Sentient and insentient alike—
each is endowed with its inherent nature—this is **Wisdom (智)**.
To arise when it is time to arise,
and to rest when it is time to rest—this is **Faithfulness (信)**.
To follow the rhythms of Heaven and Earth,
and to regulate the four seasons—this is **Rite (礼)**.
To harmonize the resonance of Heaven and Earth,
and to delight all things—this is **Music (乐)**.

Thus, in **serene stillness and non-action (恬澹无为)**,
there is nothing it does not accomplish.

When the **Great Dao (大道)** recedes,
**virtue/power (德)** takes its place in transformation.
The transformation of **Great Virtue (至德)**,
also encompasses **Great Benevolence, Great Righteousness, Great Rite, Great Wisdom, and Great Faithfulness**,
and together they transform.

But when **virtue/power (德)** declines,
**Benevolence (仁)** stands alone as **Benevolence (仁)**,
**Righteousness (义)** stands alone as **Righteousness (义)**,
and they can no longer transform together.

Why is this so?
Those who practice **Benevolence (仁)** take compassionate love as their heart,
and thus lack the firm resolve to act—
therefore, **Righteousness (义)** is absent.
Those who practice **Righteousness (义)** judge and cut away what is wrong,
taking and discarding—
therefore, **Benevolence (仁)** is absent.

Thus, when the seven stand alone—
**Benevolence (仁)** as **Benevolence (仁)**, **Righteousness (义)** as **Righteousness (义)**—
they cannot transform together.

Yet the **Supreme Benevolent (上仁)**,
though it may appear to have traces of partiality,
when it forgets **Benevolence (仁)**,
forgets its traces as well.
Though the traces may vanish,
the heart retains the thought of broad bestowal,
circulating with pity for all things,
all desiring their well-being—
thus the heart still engages in action.
The **Supreme Benevolent (上仁)** forgets its traces,
so its traces are in non-action.

*"Small kindnesses do not inspire trust"*—
this is what **Zhuo Ge (曹刿)** said to **Duke Zhuang of Lu** in the tenth year of his reign.
That year, in the first month,
the Duke defeated the Qi army at **Changsuo (长勺)**.
Before the battle, **Zhuo Ge** requested an audience.
His fellow villagers said: *"The lords of the land deliberate these matters—what need have you to hear them?"*
**Zhuo Ge** replied: *"The lords are narrow-minded and cannot think far ahead."*
He then entered to see the Duke,
who asked why he wished to fight.
The Duke said: *"Food and clothing are what sustain life—I dare not keep them for myself alone,
but must share them with others."*
**Zhuo Ge** replied: *"Small kindnesses do not reach all—
the people will not follow you."*
The Duke said: *"Sacrificial offerings and jade and silk—I dare not add to them,
but must act with sincerity."*
**Zhuo Ge** replied: *"Small sincerity does not inspire divine favor—
the spirits will not bless you."*
The Duke said: *"In great and small cases of justice,
though I may not discern them fully,
I must act according to what is proper."*
**Zhuo Ge** replied: *"This is loyalty—
with this, we can win the battle."*
He then asked to join the battle.
The Duke gave him his chariot,
and they fought at **Changsuo**.
As the Duke prepared to sound the drum,
**Zhuo Ge** said: *"Not yet."*
The Qi army sounded their drums three times,
and **Zhuo Ge** said: *"Now!"*
The Qi army was defeated.
As the Duke prepared to pursue them,
**Zhuo Ge** said: *"Not yet."*
He looked at their tracks and climbed the chariot’s rail to observe them,
then said: *"Now!"*
They pursued the Qi army and won.
After the victory, the Duke asked why.
**Zhuo Ge** replied: *"War is a matter of courage.
The first drumming rouses the spirit,
the second weakens it,
the third exhausts it.
When they were exhausted and we were full of vigor,
we defeated them.
A great army is hard to fathom—
I feared ambushes.
But their tracks were disordered,
and their flags drooped—
so I pursued them."*

This shows that small kindnesses do not reach all,
and small sincerity does not inspire trust—
thus neither spreads far.
How much less so for those who claim **universal love (兼爱)**,
though they exert themselves in the seven virtues,
are they distant from **Dao/Way (道)** and **virtue/power (德)**!

The **Supreme Righteous (上义)** acts yet has pretense of action.
**Annotation:** *Righteousness* means judging what is wrong,
thus it is said: *acts*.
With judgments to cut away what is improper,
ordering things to their proper place—
thus it is said: *yet has pretense of action*.
Here, both heart and traces are in action.

**Exegesis:** *Righteousness* is what is proper—
to judge what is wrong and cut away what is improper,
so that all things attain their proper place—this is **Righteousness (义)**.
*The Book of Plainness* says:
*"**Righteousness (义)** is what is proper for people.
To reward the good and punish the evil,
and thus establish merit and achieve deeds.
In the age of simplicity and purity,
there was no distinction of right and wrong—
when right and wrong arose, simplicity and purity dispersed.
To distinguish right from wrong,
and to judge and cut away what is improper—this is **Righteousness (义)**.
Thus, when one knows what is right and makes it clear,
and knows what is wrong and restrains it,
both heart and traces are in action.*

Yet **Righteousness (义)**,
though it establishes standards for conduct,
also gives rise to artificiality.
To govern the state or oneself by clinging to the seven virtues alone,
without **Dao/Way (道)** and **virtue/power (德)**,
what difference is there from drilling through ice to seek fire,
or driving northward to reach Chu?

The **Supreme Rite (上礼)** acts yet meets no response—
then it raises its arm in anger and persists.
**Annotation:** When the six harmonies are disrupted,
**Rite (礼)** is employed to restore order—
thus it is said: *acts*.
**Rite (礼)** values reciprocity—
if there is no response, it is not **Rite (礼)**.
To perform **Rite (礼)** toward another who does not respond,
then raise the arm in anger and persist in pressing them—
thus it is said: *raises its arm in anger and persists*.

**Exegesis:** *Rite (礼)* is what is proper to follow.
**Zhuangzi** said: *"With **Rite (礼)** as wings,
one flies through the world."*
Those who establish **Rite (礼)** do so to remedy decay.
Thus, the *Classics of Rite* number three hundred,
and the ceremonial postures three thousand—
all are elaborate measures to prevent disorder,
and structured regulations for conduct.
When the pure source is lost,
all affairs scatter and run wild.
Though outward forms are preserved,
they are not the natural order from within—
thus bowing and yielding are exalted in their formalities,
jade and silk are displayed in their offerings,
and if one goes without return, it is not **Rite (礼)**,
or if one comes without reciprocation, it is also not **Rite (礼)**.

Now, when the **Supreme Rite (上礼)** acts yet meets no response,
it raises its arm in anger and persists—
thus it is said: *raises its arm in anger and persists*.

The **Rites (义)** say: *"To be modest, retiring, and yielding in speech, while maintaining reverence to preserve harmony—this is **Rite (礼)**."*

The *Plain Book (素书)* states: *"**Rite (礼)** is the path that people tread."* To stir the winds and rest at night, it completes the threads of human relationships. **Rite (礼)** establishes solemn respect, yet it also breeds indolence and laxity. When **Rite (礼)** is rigid and formal, and music is smooth and unrestrained, then the world begins to divide.

One may possess only its outward forms, yet not follow from within.

**Worthy demeanor (威仪)**—this refers to the solemn, dignified, and awe-inspiring bearing, which is called **Worthy (威)**; the measured steps and bows, which are called **Demeanor (仪)**. The *Book of Odes (诗)* says: *"Worthy demeanor, resplendent and unyielding, none can surpass it."* Again it says: *"Friends hold each other in check, restrained by worthy demeanor."* This is so.

The *Three Hundred Rites (礼经)* and the *Three Thousand Demeanors (威仪)*—all are the postures of advancing and retreating, bowing and rising, bending and straightening. Their essence is captured in broad strokes.

The greatest of **Rites (礼)** are marriage, coronation, mourning, and sacrifice—the foundations of the state. In all actions and stillness, who does not adhere to **Rite (礼)**?

**Rite (礼)** is the embodiment of reverence, like the head above and the feet below. Rank and hierarchy are naturally ordered, not defying the natural order. Thus, ruler and subject, father and son, are as one body. When superiors and inferiors forget their distinctions, this is the true **Way (道)**.

Later practitioners of **Rite (礼)** outwardly observe forms and demeanor, yet inwardly harbor deceit and violence. When loyalty and sincerity are lacking, they accuse one another. Jade and silk are displayed to express their intentions, bows and yielding to adorn their emotions. If one gives without receiving in return, or goes without coming back, resentment and anger arise, leading to strife—thus they bring about disorder. How can this compare to the grandeur of **Great Rite (大礼)**, which aligns with the rhythms of Heaven and Earth?

Those who take **Rite (礼)** as their wings—*The Great Teacher (大宗师)* of *Zhuangzi* says: *"The ancient True Persons were upright yet not cliquish, as if insufficient yet not bearing the burden."* They take **Law (刑)** as their foundation and **Rite (礼)** as their wings. To take **Law (刑)** as foundation means to wield killing with ease; to take **Rite (礼)** as wings means to move through the world.

When **Dao (道德)** is lost, **Ren (仁)** and **Yi (义)** prevail openly. When **Ren (仁)** is lost, the traces of universal love become distorted; when **Yi (义)** is lost, the standards of right and wrong are confused. The **Junzi (君子)** offends against **Rite (礼)**, while the petty man transgresses **Law (刑)**. The Sage observes circumstances and times, applying **Rite (礼)** and **Law (刑)** accordingly. Barbarians know the punishment for defying commands, while subjects recognize the reverence due to authority.

Teaching in accordance with human nature—this is what is meant.

**Reporting and bestowing (报施)**—*The Record of Music (乐记)* says: *"Music is bestowal. **Rite (礼)** is response."* Music displays **virtue (德)**, while **Rite (礼)** responds to emotions. This is the exchange of giving and receiving.

**Preventive measures (曲为之防)**—*The Record of Prevention (防记)*#1 says: *"The **Junzi’s** Way is to prevent what is lacking."* It prevents what the people lack. The **Junzi** uses **Rite (礼)** to prevent moral decay, **Law (刑)** to prevent excess, and **Command (命)** to prevent desire. The Master said: *"The petty man, when poor, becomes stingy; when rich, becomes arrogant. Stinginess leads to theft, arrogance leads to disorder."* **Rite (礼)** adjusts human nature with proper norms and adornments, establishing boundaries for the people.

Thus, the Sage regulates wealth and nobility so that the people, though rich, do not grow arrogant, and though poor, do not become stingy. Nobility does not exceed its proper bounds, and thus disorder is further diminished. Therefore, a state’s forces should not exceed a thousand chariots, its capital walls not exceed a hundred *zhi* in height, and a family’s wealth not exceed a hundred chariots. With these measures to restrain the people, even the feudal lords would have rebels. The Master said: *"**Rite (礼)** clarifies doubts and distinguishes subtleties, establishing boundaries for the people."* Thus, rank has distinctions, clothing has differences, and the court has its positions—so the people know how to yield.

Heaven has but one sun, the earth but one king, a household but one master, and the honored but one superior—this demonstrates to the people the distinction between ruler and subject. The ruler does not ride in a carriage with a kinsman. To ride with a non-kinsman in a carriage shows that the people should not be partial. With these measures to restrain the people, the people would still conspire to kill their ruler using a kinsman’s name.

The Master said: *"If rewards and honors go first to the dead and then to the living, the people will not act in harmony."* If the dead are honored before the living, the people can be entrusted. With these measures to restrain the people, the people would still weep in despair without aid. The Master said: *"Repair the ancestral temples, revere the sacrifices, and teach the people filial piety."* With these measures to restrain the people, the people would still forget their parents. The Yin people mourned in the grave, the Zhou people mourned at home—this shows the people not to borrow mourning customs. The Master said: *"Death is the final matter of the people. I follow the Zhou."* With these measures to restrain the people, even feudal lords would have the dead unburied.

Ascending from the guest steps and receiving condolences in the guest’s seat teaches the people filial piety. Before the funeral rites are complete, one does not address the ruler, showing the people not to quarrel. With these measures to restrain the people, sons would still kill their fathers. Mourning a father for three years and a ruler for three years shows the people not to doubt. Thus, the Son of Heaven, within the Four Seas, has no guest who dares to act as host. While parents live, one does not dare claim their body, and offerings do not reach the level of chariots and horses—this shows the people not to be presumptuous. With these measures to restrain the people, the people would still forget their parents and betray their ruler.

The Master said: *"If wealth and honors come before **Rite (礼)**, the people will be greedy. If actions proceed without proper words, the people will quarrel."* With these measures to restrain the people, the people would still value wealth over conduct, bringing ruin upon themselves. The **Junzi**, when in office, does not farm; when farming, does not fish. They eat seasonal foods without indulging in delicacies. A great officer does not sit on a sheep-skin cushion, and a scholar does not sit on a dog-skin cushion. With these measures to restrain the people, the people would still forget propriety and vie for profit, destroying themselves.

**Rite (礼)** prevents the people from excess, clarifies their distinctions, ensures they have no grievances, and establishes order for them. Thus, men and women do not meet without a matchmaker or see each other without a gift—lest they lose all distinction. With these measures to restrain the people, the people would still offer themselves freely. The Master said: *"When taking a wife, one does not marry a woman of the same surname, to deepen the distinctions."* Thus, when purchasing a concubine, if her surname is unknown, one must divine it.

With these measures to restrain the people, the *Chūnqiū* [Spring and Autumn Annals] still omits the surname of a noble’s wife, calling her *"Wú"* [吴], and records her death as *"Měngzǐ zú"* [孟子卒]. When **Zhāo Gōng** [昭公] took a wife from the descendants of **Tài Bó** [太伯], they shared the same surname.

**Rite** [礼] does not apply to sacrifices, yet men and women of noble rank do not exchange vows of marriage. With these measures to restrain the people, **Yáng Hóu** [阳侯] still killed **Miáo Hóu** [缪侯] and took his wife, so the grand feast [大飨] abandoned the ritual for the deceased noble’s wife.

The Master said: *"If a widow’s son does not visit her, then he is not to be considered a friend."* Thus, the noble man avoids such proximity.

When exchanging with a friend from **Hú** [胡, foreign lands], if the host is absent, unless there is a grave matter, one does not enter their home. With these measures to restrain the people, the people would still prioritize beauty over **virtue/power** [德].

Hence, the noble man keeps his distance from beauty to uphold order among the people. In giving or receiving, men and women do not touch each other; women do not sit alone with men, widows do not weep at night, and women do not inquire after a man’s illness. With these measures to restrain the people, licentiousness and excess would still cause disorder within families.

The Master said: *"In the marriage ritual, the groom’s parents welcome the bride at the ancestral home, then the ancestral parents receive the son and deliver him to the groom, lest the rites be transgressed."* With these measures to restrain the people, wives would still fail to arrive.

Even these strict prohibitions cannot fully restrain them.

「And yet, if not restrained, what follows? This illustrates that when **virtue/power** [德] and **Dao/Way** [道] are already lost, **ren** [仁] and **righteousness** [義] are further abandoned, and though society is in chaos, the rituals persist—only to become the very source of disorder.

The influence of the **Way of Non-Action** [無為之化] recedes ever further each day.

A ruler who governs through principle—how could he forsake **Dao/Way** [道] and **virtue/power** [德] to fixate solely on ritual?

Thus, it is only when the **Dao/Way** [道] is lost that **virtue/power** [德] appears, when **virtue/power** [德] is lost that **ren** [仁] takes its place, when **ren** [仁] is lost that **righteousness** [義] arises, and when **righteousness** [義] is lost that ritual is invoked.

*Annotation: "失道者" [shī dào zhě] refers to the loss of supreme **virtue/power** [德]. Supreme **virtue/power** [德] aligns with the **Dao/Way** [道], hence "失道" [shī dào] is used.*

**Dao/Way** [道], **virtue/power** [德], **ren** [仁], and **righteousness** [義] are merely names for the varying customs of the times—now refined, now coarse.

Thus, when the **Dao/Way** [道] declines, **virtue/power** [德] emerges; when **virtue/power** [德] weakens, **ren** [仁] remains; when **ren** [仁] vanishes, **righteousness** [義] is established; and when **righteousness** [義] is lost, ritual is resorted to as a remedy.

These are all expedient measures suited to their respective eras.

Hence, to speak of ritual in the age of simplicity and purity is either madness or perversity; to neglect ritual in the era of decadence and corruption is either foolishness or falsehood.

If one can discern and adapt accordingly, they should retreat from ritual to practice **righteousness** [義], retreat from **righteousness** [義] to practice **ren** [仁], retreat from **ren** [仁] to uphold **virtue/power** [德], and abandon **virtue/power** [德] to return to the **Dao/Way** [道].

When people revert to simplicity and purity, the supreme **virtue/power** of **Non-Action** [無為] is restored.

*Annotation: This passage elucidates the origins of the flaws in wisdom.*

The loss of the **Dao/Way** [道] signifies the loss of supreme **virtue/power** [德], for supreme **virtue/power** [德] aligns with the **Dao/Way** [道], hence "失道" [shī dào].

The *Classic of Changes* states: *"When the great **Dao/Way** [道] is abandoned, there arise **ren** [仁] and **righteousness** [義]."* Zhuangzi says: *"The **Dao/Way** [道] is hidden in minor achievements, yet the **Dao/Way** [道] is never absent."*

But this refers to the loss of the grand **Dao/Way** [道], speaking in terms of human limitations.

Thus, in the age of simplicity and purity, the great **Dao/Way** [道] is openly practiced; in the era of corruption and refinement, minor rituals flourish.

When minor rituals prevail and the great **Dao/Way** [道] is obscured, **ren** [仁] and **righteousness** [義] are invoked, and supreme **virtue/power** [德] declines.

This reflects the differing customs of the ages—simplicity versus corruption—and the sage’s adaptive governance.

Hence, as simplicity and purity gradually fade, the **Dao/Way** [道] is lost, and **virtue/power** [德] takes its place.

**Virtue/power** [德] further declines, and **ren** [仁] emerges.

The traces of universal love remain, and **righteousness** [義] is established.

When **righteousness** [義] proves insufficient, ritual is resorted to as a remedy.

Moreover, to speak of ritual in the age of simplicity and purity is either madness or perversity; to neglect ritual in the era of corruption and refinement is either foolishness or falsehood.

Therefore, the sages’ intentions in addressing the ages remain consistent, though the customs of simplicity and corruption cannot be unified.

**Righteousness** [義] states: *"The loss of these five stages follows the shift from refinement to corruption across the ages. When the great simplicity is dispersed, complete **virtue/power** [德] is preserved; when **virtue/power** [德] declines, **ren** [仁] and love succeed it; when **ren** [仁] and love are inadequate, **righteousness** [義] is employed to regulate; and when **righteousness** [義] fails, ritual is resorted to as a remedy.*

Yet ritual, though invoked to curb chaos, also becomes a source of it.

How so?

When ritual becomes burdensome, customs grow shallow; when customs grow shallow, disputes arise among people; and when disputes arise, chaos ensues.

Nevertheless, for a ruler’s urgent priorities, ritual is paramount.

In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Year 26 of Duke Zhao, Yanzi addressed Duke Jing of Qi:

*"Ritual, as the foundation of a state, stands alongside Heaven and Earth. The sovereign commands with propriety, ministers respond with reverence; fathers show kindness, sons exhibit filial piety; elders love, younger siblings show respect; husbands are harmonious, wives are gentle; aunts are benevolent, and wives listen with compliance—these are all rituals.

When the sovereign commands without defiance, ministers respond with reverence without duplicity, fathers show kindness while teaching, sons exhibit filial piety while offering admonitions, elders love while fostering friendship, younger siblings show respect while obeying, husbands are harmonious while upholding **righteousness** [義], wives are gentle while maintaining correctness, aunts are benevolent while following, and wives listen with grace—this is called the harmonious practice of ritual."*

The Duke said: *"Well spoken! From this day forward, I shall hear that ritual is of supreme importance."*

The reply was: *"The ancient kings received their mandate from Heaven and Earth, and established rituals for their people. Thus, they placed rituals above all else, making them the most urgent Dao/Way to govern the world. When virtue/power and righteousness [義] are lost, and rituals no longer practiced, what else distinguishes us from beasts?

Virtue/power and righteousness [義] decay daily, yet rituals serve to rescue chaos and regulate the people—how can they not be held in high regard? Therefore, the superior person restrains himself through ritual to make it clear.

Ritual does not descend from Heaven nor emerge from Earth; it is merely a measure of human sentiment. Ritual, indeed, is the thinnest veneer of loyalty and trust, yet the root of disorder.

**Note:** *Ritual was established because loyalty and trust had waned, and to serve as the foremost means of preventing chaos.*

**Cushion:** *The word 'husband' [夫] here marks the beginning of a discourse.*

The intent of the ancient sages in instituting ritual was to address the decline of loyalty and trust. If people naturally hold loyalty and trust in their hearts, why would they need external rituals and laws? Yet if rituals are used merely to prevent chaos, they can only serve as the means to regulate disorder—not as the cultivation of virtue/power.

**Explanation:** *Chaos [乱] is regulation [理].*
Even in the Zhou, disorderly ministers were those who regulated the state.

When loyalty and trust are thin, and the hearts of the upper and lower ranks diverge, the sage institutes rituals to teach them, codifies laws to restrain them, clarifies distinctions of honor and rank to encourage them, and establishes penalties and rewards to regulate their conduct. Though loyalty may wane and trust thin, people dare not act disorderly because rituals serve to regulate them.

If these four aspects [忠信之薄、上下离心、奸乱生、礼法失] are lost and rituals are not used to regulate them, then the people will have no guidance for their actions. As the earlier text said: *‘I bend the laws to protect the people,’* yet even this may be transgressed. Thus, the great purpose of rituals is to rescue chaos and establish order.

The *Ritual Classics* [《礼经》] state: *"No means is better than ritual for securing the ruler and regulating the people; no means is better than music for transforming customs and changing habits."* Therefore, when kings achieve their goals, they compose music; when they establish order, they institute rituals. Each adapts to the times and imparts teachings, evolving across generations. One cannot rigidly adhere to ancient ways or cling to unchanging norms.

The Master said: *"Those who grasp ritual and music are the parents of the people."* To understand the essence of ritual and music, one must embody the Five Virtues [五至]—*benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust*—and practice the Three Reflections [三无]—*unselfishness, humility, and sincerity*. With such resolve, one’s spirit fills the heavens and earth, and ritual and music resonate with divine wisdom.

When speaking of *music as music*, why mention bells and drums? When speaking of *ritual as ritual*, why mention jade and silk? These are what can be applied to all under Heaven and nurture the myriad states, thus the urgency of rituals in rescuing chaos and establishing order. Only when returning to simplicity, honoring natural harmony, and restoring virtue/power can rituals truly be abandoned.

**Previously knowing [前识] is the ornament of the Dao/Way and the beginning of folly.**

**Note:** *‘Recognizing’ [识] refers to human nature’s discernment.* To establish rituals before people recognize their own nature is to adorn the Dao/Way with external trappings, even if it aims to suit the times. In truth, it erodes simplicity, hence it is called the ornament of the Dao/Way.

Rituals, meant to curb chaos, value harmony above all. Yet those who disregard the spirit of ritual, focusing only on its jade and silk, its bowing and kneeling, are the very ones who initiate folly.

**Cushion:** *‘Previously knowing’ [前识] refers to those who establish rituals.* It means that before people have recognized their own nature, they are made to follow these external regulations. The Dao/Way follows natural human inclinations, while ritual preserves outward appearances. To impose rituals upon this natural Dao/Way is to distort its essence, hence the term *ornament of the Dao/Way*.

Yet this becomes the beginning of folly because those who enforce rituals do not cultivate the inherent nature of the heart but only adorn outward forms. Reverence and affection are insufficient; jade and silk are excessive. This is not the true path of enlightenment but the source of folly.

**Explanation:** *The intention behind establishing rituals is to remedy flaws.* Why so? When virtue/power is lost and righteousness decays, without rituals to regulate them, deceitful chaos arises. Thus, rituals are established to remedy these flaws.

Between human nature and discernment, rituals are instituted to restrain them. Every advance, retreat, movement, or stillness is bound by ritual.

**Explanation:** *The sage understands these matters and preemptively establishes regulations.* Hence it is said that rituals are instituted *before* people recognize their own nature.

To impose rituals before people recognize their nature is to emphasize outward forms over inner substance, thus corrupting simplicity. Hence, it is called the *ornament of the Dao/Way*.

**Ornament [华]** means what is not genuine. Rituals, if not practiced with sincerity, breed flaws, and extreme flaws lead to chaos. By remedying flaws, chaos is stilled, hence it is said that rituals *curb chaos*.

When rituals are properly applied, they achieve harmony.

To feign outward appearances and adorn external forms, yet lack inner sincerity, is to become the source of folly.

**Explanation:** *Rituals are instituted to teach love through familial bonds and reverence through authority.* Love is how one serves one’s parents, and reverence is how one serves one’s ruler. If love and reverence do not arise from the heart, but are merely expressed through jade and silk, what else is this but folly?

The purpose of ritual is to arrange distinctions of rank, clarify the hierarchy of superiors and inferiors, differentiate the alike from the unlike, and rectify human relationships, ensuring that rulers and subjects, fathers and sons, do not lose their proper order. Yet today’s rituals are internally contradictory, outwardly ostentatious while inwardly decayed, superficial while their foundations are weak. Rituals are now thinner than loyalty, expedience lighter than trust, and authority does not extend to righteousness, while virtue/power does not reach the Seven Grades [七]. They are the end of regulation and the beginning of chaos.

Deceit and hypocrisy originate from them, and disputes and contention arise because of them. With rituals but no sincerity, actions do not stem from the heart—such is insufficient to remedy flaws, yet more than enough to cause political disorder.

How so? When rituals become overly elaborate, people’s movements grow constrained, bound by fixed rules and measures. In their bearing, they are as winding as dragons and tigers, yet in their counsel, they resemble sons, and in their guidance, they resemble fathers. Through habituation, they invert values—*considering substance vulgar and form refined*—pursuing reputation and empty display, crafting cleverness for competition, and esteeming ornamentation as restraint.

「Thus it is said: *Excessive ritual brings chaos, and shifting wisdom breeds deceit.* Hence, Dan Zhu was not transformed by the *Xian Chi* [咸池], and Shang Jun was not changed by the *Jiu Cheng* [九成]. Though music and ritual were established, they could not prevent disorder.

Therefore, in times of vulgar chaos, what use are rituals? Songs and odes of elegance cannot sway the winds of custom; bells, drums, strings, and reeds cannot alter the coarse manners of the people. Modesty and yielding words fail to gain the world’s trust; maintaining softness and returning to the receptive cannot earn the world’s affection. Offering high rank and rewards cannot attract the worthy; extending one’s arm and taking another’s hand cannot summon the virtuous.

When outward appearance is meager yet speech is extravagant, and sincerity does not dwell in the heart—such rituals are but empty forms, useless in saving the world.

Thus, one knows that *moving Heaven and Earth, stirring spirits and gods* depends on sincere reverence in the heart, extending the heart to the Dao/Way, and manifesting virtue in its pure essence. Only then will the divine be nourished.

The muddy waters of stagnant pools, the dense greens of sprouting vegetables, the baskets and vessels of clay and bronze—though they may shame kings and nobles, they can be offered to the gods. These are the rituals that stem from sincerity.

If one does not attain this, it is the beginning of folly.

Hence, a true Daoist/Wayist [大丈夫] dwells in the profound and substantial, not in the superficial and thin. He abides in the true, not in the ornate.

**Note:**
The *Xian Chi* [咸池] refers to the shallow; the *Jiu Cheng* [九成] refers to the incomplete.

The *Daoist/Wayist* [有道之君子], that is, the sovereign of the highest virtue mentioned earlier, possesses vast and profound aspirations in the Dao/Way and virtue/power [道德]. The term *great* [大] signifies the vastness of the Dao/Way and virtue/power. *Man* [丈夫] means ten, the limit of a person’s height and maturity, ten *chi* [尺] making a *zhang* [丈], hence *Man* [丈夫].

Thus, Laozi’s ten titles also include *Daoist/Wayist* [大丈夫] and *Great Sage Teacher* [大圣师].

The sovereign who embraces the Dao/Way and embodies the transformation of supreme virtue/power [上德之化] acts without contrivance, refining and subtly guiding. He teaches through the Dao/Way, and people follow the Dao/Way, dwelling in its substance. He nurtures through virtue/power, and beings follow virtue/power, abiding in its profundity. He does not rely on the superficiality of preconceived knowledge or the thinness of ritualistic constraints to transform people, hence it is said he does not dwell in the superficial and thin.

The *Scripture of Communing with the Mysterious* [《通玄真经》] states:
*A true Daoist/Wayist [大丈夫] is tranquil without favor, serene without concern, walking where no path exists, wandering without fatigue, emerging without door, entering without room. He aligns his spirit and subdues his perceptions, drifting effortlessly yet accomplishing all. Thus, he abandons the former and takes the latter.*

**Note:**
*Abandoning the former* refers to superficial and thin rituals; *taking the latter* refers to profound and substantial virtue/power.

**Commentary:**
The former refers to ritualistic propriety [礼义]; the latter refers to the Dao/Way and virtue/power [道德]. The Sage abandons the superficiality of ritualistic propriety and embraces the profundity of the Dao/Way and virtue/power, hence it is said to abandon the former and take the latter.

If one argues that the Sage’s myriad concerns all converge to a single end, and dual boundaries are both extinguished—how could there be distinctions of abandoning or taking?

It is merely a teaching to guide the common, a rhetorical device for instruction.

**Meaning:**
This applies to the Daoist/Wayist [大丈夫] and below, urging those who seek to embody transformation to esteem the Dao/Way and virtue/power, return to simplicity and purity, abandon the superficial traces of ritualistic propriety, and change the ornate appearance of thin customs. They should dwell in the profundity of the Dao/Way and virtue/power, not in the shallowness of ritualistic propriety, abide in the purity of simplicity, not in the finery of jade and silk. They should guide those with understanding toward the unity of the Mysterious, and elevate the sentient toward the realm of the Dao/Way.

It is said to abandon ritualistic propriety and embrace the Dao/Way and virtue/power. This is the teaching and admonition passed down, not an actual distinction of abandoning or taking by the Sage.

If a sovereign can abandon ritualistic propriety yet uphold justice, discard justice yet practice the Seven Grades [七], reject benevolence yet uphold virtue/power, defy virtue/power yet align with the Dao/Way—abandoning the superficial traces and returning to the fundamental essence—using this as his transformation, would he not reach perfection?

**Volume Thirty-One of the *Extensive Scripture on the True Dao/Way and Virtue/Power* [《道德真经广圣义》]**
**Narrated by Tang Guangcheng Master Du Guangting [唐广成先生杜光庭述]**

---

**Chapter Thirty-Nine of the *Obtaining the One* [昔之得一章]**
**Commentary:** The previous chapter elucidates the distinctions between the upper virtue and lower rites—one pure, the other refined. Therefore, it presents the conduct of the mature man in taking and leaving to show the direction of things. This chapter clarifies that when things obtain the Dao/Way, they manifest its use and thus come to fruition; adherence to the Dao preserves them, while arrogance causes their loss. Hence, it enumerates the humble and modest virtue of the feudal lords and kings as a warning.

**Explication:** The Dao/Way is the divine essence of heaven and earth, the source from which all things obtain the *One*. This serves to illustrate that when the Dao is employed, there is tranquility, but when it is lost, there is peril. It warns the feudal lords and kings that adherence to the Dao brings fortune, while transgression brings misfortune. Yet the feudal lords and kings adhere to the Dao through humility and restraint, accumulating virtue as their foundation. They do not desire to be like jade—its brilliance is held up as the ultimate warning.

**Those who obtained the One in antiquity:**
**Annotation:** The *One* refers to the harmonious *qi* of the Dao/Way.

Because its wondrous use in all things is unified, it is called the *One*. Thus, the *Commentary* states: In antiquity, the *One* was the harmonious *qi*. It is called the *One* because it is identical with all things, unchanging from ancient times to the present. This is what is meant by the *One*. Hence, the *Systematic Commentary of the Yijing* [《易□系》] says: "The alternation of one *yin* and one *yang*—this is called the Dao/Way." It reveals that the Dao/Way’s *qi* is harmonized with *yin* and does not merge with *yin*, nor does it merge with *yang* and *yang*—this is what is meant by the *One*.

Speaking of antiquity, it is to trace the origin and reach the end, to suppress the superficial and return to the fundamental, and to draw upon past attainment to verify present attainment. The principle of the *One* will be briefly expounded below.

**Explication:** The Sage Laozi, wishing to elucidate the harmonious Dao/Way’s *qi*, which permeates all things, and to expound the wondrous attainment of the *One*, does so to clarify the source of generation and transformation. The Dao’s generation and transformation have neither end nor beginning; borrowing the meaning of antiquity’s enduring expanse, it serves as the origin for the dissemination of its transformations.

The reason the Dao is called the *One* is that in the generation of all things, the Dao’s *qi* descends uniformly. When the *qi* exists, things are born; when the *qi* vanishes, things die. The way in which things receive the Dao’s *qi* is no different; in all things, it is the *One*. Though ancient and modern times may change, the *One* itself remains unaltered. Hence, it is said to be unchanging—this is what is meant by the *One*.

The Dao is neither *yin* nor *yang*; in *yang*, it is *yang*; in *yin*, it is *yin*. It is also like this: in heaven, it is clear; on earth, it is tranquil. Wherever it resides, it harmonizes. The Dao is not confined to *yin* and *yang*, yet it can be *yin* and can be *yang*; it is not limited to heaven and earth, yet it can be heaven and can be earth. It is not singular, yet it can be singular. It revolves and returns, and there is nothing it cannot do.

Since antiquity has obtained it, the present still follows it. Thus, it is known that a vacant mind brings the Dao’s harmony, and profound stillness returns to the *One*. Those who can achieve profound stillness and a vacant mind—this is what is meant by suppressing the superficial and returning to the fundamental.

"The alternation of one *yin* and one *yang*—this is called the Dao/Way," are the words of the *Systematic Commentary of the Yijing* [《易□系》]. The *One* is called the *Non-One* [无], for without *yin* and without *yang*, it is the Dao. The *One* attains the *Non-One* because it is the boundless void, indivisible, and only the *One* exists. Hence, the *One* is the *Non-One*.

If there were boundaries, distinctions between opposites, then there would be two or three, and it would not be the *One*. Therefore, when the Dao is in *yin*, it does not appear as the function of *yin*; when the Dao is in *yang*, it does not appear as the power of *yang*. *Yin* and *yang* are natural, without contrivance—this is the Dao.

The *One* is spoken of as a number; numbers are spoken of as the *One*. In terms of substance, it is the *Non-One*, yet things obtain the Dao’s interpenetration. Its subtlety is beyond measure—this is called the *Divine* [神]; its transformations respond to circumstances—this is called the *Yijing* [易]. In summary, all things without distinction are called the Dao. Hence, the Sage establishes the names and titles of human affairs in accordance with its principles, not singular yet singular, thus able to remain constantly singular. Constantly singular is not singular, nor is it not singular. Yet it is the *One*, for it is the beginning of heaven and earth, the origin of all things, the foundation of generation and transformation, and the revered source of life.

From the *One*, it can be *yin* and can be *yang*—this is how the *One* generates the *Two*. Tracing the origin and reaching the end means that *yuan* [原] is the foundation, and *yao* [要] is clarification. The *Systematic Commentary of the Yijing* [《易□系》] uses these terms.

Heaven obtains the *One* and thus is clear,
**Commentary:** There is no greater manifestation of *qi* than the *Great Primordial* [乾元]. Hence, it is first marked as the foremost attainment of the *One*. The pure *yang* *qi*, because it obtains the *One*, can thus be vast and encompassing, providing the beginning for all things.

**Explication:** The *yang* *qi* is expansive; the *Great Primordial* [乾] is vast and primordial, generating all things. All things rely on the *Great Primordial* for their birth, hence the *Yijing* says: "Great indeed is the *Great Primordial*! All things draw their beginnings from it." Heaven is the accumulation of *qi*, hence it is the greatest manifestation of *qi*, its form like a tilted canopy, thus it is said to be vast and encompassing. This gives rise to the saying of the "Tilted Heaven" [穹天].

Speaking of heaven as vast and encompassing, high and round, it envelops all things. Heaven is the embodiment of pure *yang* and the void, not a material obstruction. Yet heaven, without the operation of the harmonious Dao/Way’s *qi*, could not be clear and floating without rest.

The *Systematic Commentary of the Yijing* [《易□系》] says: "The *Great Primordial* [乾] is the most robust vitality under heaven." The *Great Primordial* clearly manifests itself to people—this is easy to understand. The *Systematic Commentary of the Yijing* [《易□系》] says: "The *Great Primordial* is firm and clearly shows people its harmony. Because it obtains the *One* and does nothing, all things are thereby generated, and it shows people its ease."

If the *Great Primordial* were not firm, or if it were to collapse or fracture, it would not be able to demonstrate its attainment of the *One* and its simple, easy Dao/Way.

Earth obtains the *One* and thus is tranquil,
**Commentary:** There is no greater manifestation of form and substance than the *Receptive* [坤仪]. The pure *yin* substance, because it obtains the *One*, can thus be vast and thick, bearing and nurturing all things.

**Explication:** The *yin* *qi* is expansive; the *Receptive* [坤] is vast and thick, bearing and nurturing all things, merging and uniting without limit. Earth is the accumulation of form, hence it is the greatest manifestation of form and substance, soft and yielding, tranquil, and all things draw their growth from it. Yet earth, without the operation of the harmonious Dao/Way’s *qi*, could not be thickly bearing and tranquil.

The *Systematic Commentary of the Yijing* [《易□系》] says: "The *Receptive* [坤] is the most yielding under heaven."

The *Receptive* [坤], indeed, is **simply** shown to all—
**Commentary:** This explains how the Earth obtains the *One*.

Because it obtains the *One*, the *Receptive* [坤] is thus **simply** yielding and soft, naturally effortless, and thereby fulfills all things. Hence, it is simply shown to all.
If the *Receptive* [坤] were not simply yielding, but instead **rigidly** firm, it could not simply be shown to all—this would contradict its obtaining the *One*.

The **Spirit** [神] obtains the *One* and thus is **responsive**.
**Commentary:** The *Spirit* [神] is the subtle principle that animates all things. Because it obtains the *One*, it can **respond** without limit, defying form and definition.
**Explication:** In Heaven, it is called *Spirit* [神]; on Earth, it is called *Only* [只]; in Man, it is called *Ghost* [鬼].
Generally speaking, it is termed *Spirit* [神].
The *Spirit* [神] is the **unfathomable interplay** of *yin* and *yang*, with **boundless** concealment and revelation.

Yet the *Spirit* [神], without the operation of the harmonious Dao/Way’s *qi*, could not **respond** with boundless transformation and unfathomable responsiveness.
To fail in boundless transformation and unfathomable responsiveness is to contradict its obtaining the *One*.

The **Valley** [谷] obtains the *One* and thus is **abundant**.
**Commentary:** Water flows into streams, and streams into valleys. The Valley obtains the *One*, hence its springs flow endlessly, abundant and inexhaustible.
**Explication:** The Han Valley obtains the harmonious Dao/Way’s *qi* in operation, and thus water flows abundantly.
Should the Dao/Way’s *qi* depart, the deep valley would become a mound.
If the deep valley becomes a mound, the waters dry up and the streams run empty—this contradicts the Valley’s obtaining the *One*.

All things obtain the *One* and thus **are born**.
**Commentary:** *Things* [物] encompasses all animate and inanimate beings, from plants and animals to sentient and insentient forms.
Because they obtain the harmonious Dao/Way’s *qi*, they are born and grow, never ceasing or perishing.
**Explication:** *All* [万] signifies the greatest multitude.
The *Spring and Autumn Annals* [《春秋》] states: "All [万] is the largest of numbers."
*Things* [物] refers to all forms with substance and visibility.
*Encompasses* [该] means *includes* or *approximates*.
*Animates* [动] refers to creatures like fish, insects, birds, and beasts, as well as those that crawl or fly.
*Plants* [植] refers to mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees.
*Sentient* [有情] refers to beings with both form and consciousness.
*Insentient* [无情] refers to beings with form but lacking consciousness.
Though these things number in the billions and trillions, without the harmonious Dao/Way’s *qi* in operation, they cannot be born or fulfilled.

The **Noble Lords and Kings** [侯王] obtain the *One* and thus **uphold** the Dao/Way for all under Heaven.
**Commentary:** Noble Lords and Kings are the sovereigns of the people. *Noble Lords* [侯] are the highest of the five ranks of nobility. *Kings* [王] are rulers of the myriad chariots.
Because Noble Lords and Kings obtain the *One*, they can **endure** as rulers of all under Heaven, without thought, all submit, and thus **uphold** the Dao/Way’s harmony.

The original text sometimes uses the character **uphold** [贞], which is the same as **Dao/Way** [正].
**Explication:** *King* [王] is the general title for a ruler.
*Guanzi* [《管子》] says: "Universal virtue is called *King* [王]."
The ancient practice of creating characters used three strokes to symbolize Heaven, Earth, and Man, connecting the middle stroke to represent the harmonious Dao/Way, hence *universal virtue* [通德] is called *King* [王].
It is also said that *King* [王] is the title to which all people turn.
The *King* [王] occupies the highest position, unifying the Three Powers [三才].
The character *King* [王] uses three strokes with the middle stroke connected, symbolizing the ruler who unites Heaven, Earth, and Man.
The *Spring and Autumn Annals* [《春秋》] states: "The kings of today are the emperors of antiquity."
In times before Yao and Shun, all were called *Emperors* [帝].
Shun passed his rule to Yu, but Yu humbly declined, saying his virtue did not match that of the *Emperors* [帝], so he abandoned the title of *Emperor* [帝] and took that of *King* [王].
It was also said that after Yu’s death, he passed his rule to Yi, but Yu’s son Qi resided on Mount Ji. Qi was virtuous, so the feudal lords abandoned Yi and paid homage to Qi. Though Yu had the title of passing rule to Yi, all under Heaven turned to Qi.
Qi, considering his virtue did not match that of the Five *Emperors* [五帝], took the title of *King* [王].
From then on, all rulers took the title of *King* [王].
When Qin unified all under Heaven, it swallowed the feudal lords and became the sole ruler. It then took the titles of the Three August Ones [三皇] above and the Five *Emperors* [五帝] below, combining them into the title of *Emperor* [皇帝].
The title of *King* [王] today is the highest of the five ranks.
Under Han law, only the Liu family could be *Kings* [王], and only meritorious officials could be *Noble Lords* [侯].
This custom was followed thereafter, with the sons of the Heavenly Son [天子] being made *Kings* [王], and the eldest son being the *Heir-Apparent* [太子].
From the time of the Zhou dynasty, the *King*’s [王] sons were called *Prince* [王子], and the *King*’s [王] grandsons were called *Grand Prince* [王孙].
The Tang dynasty established the law that the *Emperor*’s [皇帝] grandsons and nephews were to be called *Duke* [郡王], and their successors were called *Heir-Duke* [嗣王].
Those of other surnames with merit were sometimes also made *Kings* [王], or given honorific titles, or made *Duke* [郡王].
Yet none of these held the position of ruling land.

The *Noble Lords* [侯] are the second rank of the five ranks: *Duke* [公], *Noble Lord* [侯], *Earl* [伯], *Viscount* [子], *Baron* [男].
The term *Noble Lords and Kings* [侯王] takes the *Noble Lords* [侯] as the representative of the five ranks, the rest being implied.
Yet the Noble Lords and Kings, though they occupy the highest rank and possess the wealth of all the people, must employ the harmonious Dao/Way’s *qi* and the principle of **non-action** [无为] to guard their position, and only then can they endure as rulers and maintain harmonious governance.
Hence the Classic says: "The Sage holds the *One* and thus serves as a model for all under Heaven."
*Without thought, all submit* [无思不服] is from *The Odes of King Wen* [《诗□文王之风》], which speaks of King Wen’s virtue:
All people, east, west, south, and north, are moved by his virtue, their hearts without fail submitting to him.
This is how he **achieves** it.

**Commentary:** Things obtain the Dao/Way’s operation, and thus names are established based on their use.

The Dao/Way endures, and thus names are established; when its use is lost, reality is forfeited.

Hence, when the heavens are clear, the earth serene, the spirits manifest, and the granaries full—all these arise from attaining the marvelous operation of the Dao/Way. Thus it is said: *"This is how it is achieved."*

**Commentary:** This summarizes the preceding meaning and introduces what follows. *Achieve* means *obtain*. How do the heavens attain their clarity, the earth its tranquility, the spirits their luminous transformations, the granaries their abundance, all things their flourishing, and the lords and kings their rectitude? All obtain it through the marvelous operation of the Dao/Way. This demonstrates the benefit of attaining the Dao/Way. The following text elucidates the harm of losing it.

The *Explanation* states: The six—heaven, earth, spirits, granaries, all things, and lords and kings—how do they preserve their constancy and remain steadfast in their place? It is because they attain the harmonious *qi* of the Dao/Way and each reach its perfection. The heavens become clear through it, the earth serene, the spirits luminous, the granaries full, all things flourish, and the lords and kings govern with rectitude. If they do not lose the Dao/Way, each fulfills its proper role. Those who fail are as the following text makes clear.

If the heavens lack clarity, they risk fracturing.
**Commentary:** *Lack* is an expression of sincerity. *With* means *through*. Those who cling to existence perish; those who grasp at possession lose. The heavens, through the Dao/Way’s operation, attain clear and floating purity. If they do not uphold the harmonious *qi* of the Dao/Way but instead cling to their clarity, they risk breaking apart, failing to manifest their form.

The *Explanation* states: The heavens are *yang qi*; the sovereign mirrors them. When *yang qi* reaches its extreme, it brings calamity and decline; when the harmonious *qi* disperses, it leads to fracture. Thus the divinations say: When the heavens split, it is because *yang qi* is insufficient, the sovereign’s virtue decayed, and the heavens crack. During the Jin Dynasty’s Emperor Hui’s reign in the Yuan Kang era, the sovereign’s virtue declined, and the heavens displayed omens of disaster. A fissure several *zhang* wide appeared in the sky, with a resounding sound—this was the loss of the harmonious *qi* of the One. From then on, the Western Jin collapsed, and both Emperor Hui and Emperor Ai bore its blame. The sovereign truly mirrors the responsive *qi* of the heavens.

If the earth lacks serenity, it risks erupting.
**Commentary:** The earth, through the Dao/Way’s operation, attains political tranquility, yet one must forget its tranquility. If one clings to its serenity, it risks erupting and failing to maintain its form.

The *Explanation* states: The earth is *yin qi*, mirroring the ministers, consorts, and female rulers. When *yin qi* reaches its extreme and the harmonious *qi* disperses, eruptive changes occur. *The Records of the Grand Historian* states: In the second year of King You of Zhou (sin-xu), the three rivers of Western Zhou trembled, and Mount Qi collapsed. Laozi said: The *qi* of heaven and earth, if not kept in order, is disrupted by human affairs. When *yang* is suppressed and cannot emerge, and *yin* is oppressed and cannot nourish, thus there is an earthquake. Now the rivers truly tremble—*yang* has lost its place and oppresses *yin*. When *yang* is lost in *yin*, the source must be blocked. The source blocked, the state must perish. Water and soil spread to benefit the people. If the soil has no spread, the people lack resources—what need is there to wait for ruin? This is the loss of the harmonious *qi* of the Dao/Way’s operation.

During the Spring and Autumn period’s 242 years, there were five earthquakes, along with disasters like the collapse of Liang Mountain, Sha Lu, and Stone Speak omens. From the Qin and Han dynasties onward, such events are innumerable. The greater ones submerged cities, the lesser ones toppled bridges and huts. All were regional calamities, and the people bore their blame.

If the spirits lack luminosity, they risk fading.
**Commentary:** The spirits, through the Dao/Way’s operation, attain boundless transformations, yet one must forget their precision. If one clings to their luminosity, they risk fading and failing to operate marvelously.

The *Explanation* states: The essential forms of heaven and earth, the shapes of all things—all are governed by luminous spirits. The luminous spirits are the refined and vital *qi* within, responding and transforming into spirits. The great govern heaven and earth; the small govern states, mountains, and rivers. If they uphold constancy and follow harmony, they can transform beyond measure. If they indulge their power and appear monstrous to people, violating the Dao/Way’s *qi*, they risk extinction.

In the thirty-second year of Duke Lǐ of *Spring and Autumn*, in the seventh month, a spirit descended upon Xīn. The Duke of Guo entertained it. Duke Hui of Zhou asked the Inner Historian Guò: "What is the meaning of this?" He replied: "When a state is about to prosper, a luminous spirit descends to inspect its virtue. When it is about to perish, a spirit also descends to observe its wickedness. Thus there are those who attain spirits and prosper, and those who attain spirits and perish. Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou all had such cases. The Duke of Guo’s name was Liáng, and his virtue was cold—was he about to perish?" Later, the State of Guó was indeed destroyed.

In ancient times, the River Spirit was tyrannical, taking brides from mortals. Xīmén Bāo cast the witch into the river, and the harm ceased; the spirit also faded. This was the spirit, not guarding the Dao/Way’s *qi*, inflicting harm upon people, and thus bringing about its own annihilation.

If the granaries lack abundance, they risk drying up.
**Commentary:** The granaries, through the Dao/Way’s operation, attain receptivity without depletion, yet one must forget their fullness. If one clings to their abundance, they risk drying up and failing to flow and nourish.

The *Explanation* states: The granaries’ ability to receive without depletion comes from attaining the harmonious *qi* of the Dao/Way. When the Dao/Way’s *qi* departs, it leads to monstrous changes, tied to the rise and fall of states. Laozi said: When the Luo River dried up, Xia perished; when the Yellow River dried up, Shang perished. In the sin-xu year of King You of Zhou, the rivers dried up and mountains collapsed—this was the omen of Zhou’s destruction. Destruction came within no more than ten years, as fate decreed. When the count reached ten, it was the extreme. In the eleventh year, regen-shēn, Western Zhou was destroyed by the Rénzhōng. The Eastern Derivation of the King followed.

If all things lack vitality, they risk annihilation.
**Commentary:** All things, through the Dao/Way’s operation, attain life. If one clings to them, they risk death and failing to be living beings.

The *Dao/Way*’s principle states:

All formed things—sentient and insentient alike—draw upon the harmonious *qi* of the Dao/Way to live, and lose it to die.

*The Western Ascension Scripture* says: *"When the vital *qi* disperses, life perishes."*
*The Inner Observation Scripture* declares: *"When *qi* enters the body, it is called life; when the spirit departs from form, it is called death."*
Spirit and *qi* are both manifestations of the Dao/Way.
When the Dao/Way abides, life persists; when it departs, death follows.
Truly so.
Even sovereigns, though exalted, risk ruin if they overreach.

**Commentary:** Those who attain the Dao/Way must not boast of its use.
Thus, the heavens must not pride themselves on their clarity, lest they fracture;
the earth must not pride itself on its stability, lest it erupt;
the spirit, if proud, will lose its luminosity;
the valleys, if proud, will dry up;
all things, if proud, will perish.
Sovereigns who pride themselves in their nobility risk collapse.

The sacred teachings endure through ages, fundamentally for the sake of living beings.
Though they speak of the heavens’ purity and the earth’s tranquility,
their ultimate lesson lies in sovereigns guarding humility and embodying the Dao/Way.
Thus, it follows:

The *Dao/Way*’s principle states:
Sovereigns govern through the Dao/Way to secure their exalted station, to rank above all, and to stand supreme.
If they uphold a spirit of humility, avoid excess, align with the people’s hearts, and practice serene governance,
they will enjoy enduring prosperity, and the realm will willingly revere them.

*The Book of Changes*’ *Humility* hexagram says:
*"The humble noble, through humility, preserves himself."*

If one defies the Dao/Way, reverses natural order, indulges in tyranny, loses the harmony of balance, or abandons the principle of unity,
they will meet ruin—both person and state.
Examples include:
Sovereigns—Jin’s Duke Linggong (夷皋), Song’s Duke Zhao (杵白), Qi’s Duke Yi (商人), and Chen’s Duke Ling (平国);
Kings—Xia’s Tai Kang, Yin’s Wu Yi, Zhou’s You and Li, and Han’s Emperors Huan and Ling.
All transgressed Heaven’s order, defied the Dao/Way, and courted annihilation.

**Commentary:** The sacred teachings, as recorded in the *Book of Documents*, declare: *"Heaven creates all things, but only humans are endowed with sentience."*
The sovereign, as parent to the people, must embody the Dao/Way’s governance, nurturing them as parents nurture their children.
First, it warns of Heaven and Earth’s fragility when severed from the Dao/Way’s *qi*—how much more so for sovereigns?
Thus, nobility must root itself in humility, and elevation in submission.

**Commentary:** Sovereigns’ grandeur depends on the people’s foundation.
Those who govern must labor to unite them through humility, fostering harmony.
Otherwise, they will scatter.

**Commentary:** The exalted refers to sovereigns; the lowly, to the common folk.
Sovereigns derive their nobility from the people—thus, the lowly are the true foundation of the exalted.

The *Dao/Way*’s principle states:
Those who govern a realm wield power through one, yet cannot govern alone.
They must rely on the multitude to secure their throne, uphold their authority, enforce decrees, and extend benevolence and awe—
thus ruling over the people.

The common folk are the multitude.

**Commentary:** The *Book of Documents* says: *"The people are the root of the state; if the root is firm, the state endures."*
Sovereigns must prioritize humility and unity—truly the foundation of a stable realm.

The *Dao/Way*’s principle states:
*"The people are the root of the state"*—as in the *Five Sons’ Song* of the *Book of Documents*:
Tai Kang, in his thirteenth year, hunted recklessly beyond Youle for ten moons without return.
His five younger brothers escorted their mother to follow.
They recounted the warnings of the August Yu:
*"The people may be approached, but not dominated.
The people are the root of the state; if the root is firm, the state endures.
I survey the realm—even the most foolish woman or man can surpass me."*
The sovereign must revere the common folk to win their hearts.
Tai Kang, eldest son of Yu’s heir Qi, lost his virtue and was swiftly overthrown by the Youyong clan.
Exiled beyond the Yellow River, he never regained his throne, and Xia’s dynasty perished.
Only when Minor Kang came of age was the state restored.

Thus, humility is the sovereign’s duty.
*The Book of Changes* says:
*"Humility is the handle of virtue—humble and exalted, it shines.*
*The Heavenly Way diminishes excess and honors humility;
the spirits harm excess and bless humility;
human nature abhors excess and cherishes humility.*
Humility subdues others—it is the grip of virtue,
like the handle of an axe, by which one wields power.
The sovereign who embraces humility can govern the world."*

The sovereign’s position is already exalted, yet if he can maintain humility, his governance will shine ever brighter. Humility draws the people’s allegiance—thus it is called *"gathering the people."*

A state is the people; its foundation is its people. How can one fail to cherish and nurture them?

**Commentary:** The *Odes* say, *"Joyous and kind, the virtuous one—
the people’s father and mother."* *Joyous* means delight, *kind* means ease. When a ruler embodies these virtues, loving and nurturing his people, they hold him dear as children do their parents. But if his conduct is the opposite, the people will scatter and depart.

**Explanation:** The *Odes* refer to the words of *"Great Odes—Dongzhao"* [incomplete]. Chuo Kang Gong admonished King Cheng, saying: *"The Heavenly Sovereign nourishes those with virtue and honors those who follow the Way. If a lord has the Way, Heaven nourishes him; if he has virtue, Heaven draws near to him. When one aligns with Heaven, the people rally to him as children to their parents. But if he defies the Way and corrupts virtue, the people will rebel and abandon him, and he cannot long retain his position.*

Thus, lords call themselves *"lonely"* (*gu*), *"widowed"* (*gua*), or *"not-grain"* (*bu gu*),—is this not treating humility as their foundation? Is it not so?

**Commentary:** *"Lonely," "widowed," "not-grain"*—these are terms of self-debasement that lords adopt, taking humility as their root. If not, then they treat lowliness as their foundation.

**Explanation:** This concludes the prior meaning. When lords call themselves *"lonely"* with their ministers, it is as in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, where in the seventh year of Duke Zhao, the Chu ruler built the Cheng Hua terrace and wished to invite the lords to attend its completion. When the structure was finished, he held a sacrifice called *"Luo."* The Grand Steward, Ji Chang, said, *"I can secure the Duke of Lu."* Ji Chang went to invite the Duke of Lu, who declined, saying:

*"Long ago, our former lord, Duke Cheng, commanded my minister Ying Qi: ‘I shall not forget our former lord’s kindness. I will send Heng Fu to oversee Chu, to stabilize its state and pacify its people, thus bringing order.’ Ying Qi received this charge at the Shu Alliance in the second year of Duke Cheng. Since then, I have never failed to uphold it, and now it has been passed to the ancestral temple. From our former lord, Duke Gong, onward—waiting in vain for the sun and moon—four kings have succeeded: Gong, Kang, Jiao Ao, and Ling. Their blessings have not yet reached us, save for Duke Xiang’s gracious attendance at my lord’s funeral. I, with my ministers, grieve that our plans have failed, and the state is in disarray. How can we dare to long for your lord’s favor? If your lord would deign to visit, we would be honored, and Chu would be blessed, fulfilling the Shu Alliance’s intent and your lord’s benevolence. Then my lord would have received his reward—what more could Shu desire? The spirits of our former lords would rejoice, not just my lord alone. If you do not come, let me ask when you might travel, so my lord can present silk and meet you at Shu to receive his reward."*

The Duke dreamed of Duke Xiang’s spirit before departing. Zao Shen said, *"Do not go."* Duke Xiang, when visiting Chu, had dreamed of the Duke of Zhou’s spirit before setting out. Now Duke Xiang’s spirit truly appeared—your lord should not go."

Zi Fu Hui Bo said, *"Go."* *"Our former lord never visited Chu, so the Duke of Zhou’s spirit guided him. Duke Xiang has already gone, and his spirit now guides you. If you do not go, where will you go?"* In the third month, the Duke traveled to Chu. The Duke of Zheng greeted him at Shi Liang. Meng Xi Zi acted as his attendant but failed in proper etiquette. Upon arriving in Chu, he could not properly respond to the welcoming rites. In the fourth month, the Chu ruler hosted him at the New Terrace, assigning a long-bearded official as his attendant. He favored a large, curved bow. Later, he regretted this.

Ji Chang heard of it and saw the Duke. The Duke spoke to him, and Ji Chang bowed in congratulations. The Duke asked, *"What do I have to congratulate?"* Ji Chang replied, *"Qi, Jin, and Yue have long desired this. My lord has no equal, and the favor has passed to you. May you defend against the three neighboring states and guard your treasures well—how could I not congratulate you?"* The Duke, fearful, returned home.

This shows Chu Ling’s lack of trustworthiness, which is why his reign did not endure. In the ninth month, the Duke returned from Chu. Meng Xi Zi was ill and could not perform the rites properly. He then began studying, and those who could perform the rites followed him. Thus, Nan Gong Jing Shu and those below him studied the rites with Confucius. Confucius and Jing Shu went to Zhou to inquire about the rites from Lao Jun.

**Commentary:** Those who call themselves *"not-grain"* do so because they detest insincerity and lack of virtue.

**Explanation:** In the eleventh year of Duke Cheng of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Qin and Jin formed an alliance at Cheng, and they planned to meet at Ling Hu.

The Duke of Jin arrived first, but the Qin Marquis refused to cross the River. These were the Duke of Jin’s **Lì** (厲) and the Qin Marquis’s **Huán** (桓).

The Qin Marquis then proceeded to **Wángchéng** (王城), and sent his minister **Shǐ Kē** (史颗) to make a pact with the Duke of Jin at the River’s eastern bank. The Duke’s **Jì Wèi** (郄犨) made the pact with the Qin Marquis at the River’s western bank. **Fàn Wénzǐ** (范文子) remarked: “What good is this pact? The **Qí** (齐) alliance was meant to guarantee sincerity. A **huì** (会) is where sincerity begins. If one does not follow at the beginning, how can it be guaranteed?”

The Qin Marquis returned and broke the pact with Duke Cheng of Jin. In the fourth month, on the day **wùwǔ** (戊午), the Duke of Jin sent **Lǚ Xiàng** (吕相) to sever relations with Qin. At that time, the Qin Marquis had already made a pact with the Duke of Jin at Ling Hu, but he also summoned the **Dí** (狄) and **Chǔ** (楚), intending to lead them against Jin. Thus, the other lords sent their envoys to Jin as a sign of respect.

Lǚ Xiàng spoke to the Qin Marquis: “The people of Chǔ despise your divided **virtue/power** (德), and they have also come to tell me: ‘The Qin Marquis has broken the Ling Hu pact and now seeks a new pact with us. We solemnly declare to the **Hàotiān Shàngdì** (昊天上帝), the Qin **Three Dignitaries** (三公), and the Chǔ **Three Kings** (三王): Though we engage with the Duke of Jin, we only seek our own advantage.’ **Not-grain** (不谷) detests their lack of sincerity and **virtue/power** (德), so we proclaim this to warn against inconsistency.

When all the lords heard these words, they deeply regretted and were earnestly concerned, flocking to our humble ruler. Our humble ruler, in turn, eagerly obeys their commands and only seeks their favor. If you, my lord, would graciously consider the lords and grant them a pact, we would accept peace, and the lords would withdraw. If you do not extend great favor, we are unworthy, and cannot make the lords withdraw.

We dare to present this fully to your officials, so that they may deliberate and act accordingly.

The Jin **Lè Shū** (乐书), **Shì Xiè** (士燮), **Hán Jié** (韩厥), and **Zhào Zhān** (赵旃) led the four armies, with **Jì Yì** (郄毅) commanding the chariots and **Lè Zhēn** (乐针) as the right-hand officer. In the fifth month, on the day **dīnghài** (丁亥), the Jin forces, along with the allied lords’ armies and the Qin forces, fought at **Má Sūn** (麻隧). The Qin forces were utterly defeated. They captured **Qín Chéngqiāng** (秦成羌) and **Bù Gēngsǐ Fù** (不更汝父).

This shows that the Qin Marquis broke the pact—Qin was wrong, Jin was right—and so this defeat occurred.

**Commentary:** Furthermore, according to ritual, one who lacks a father calls himself **gū** (孤), and one who lacks a husband calls herself **guǎ** (寡). **Gǔ** (谷) means good, so **bù gǔ** (不谷) is like saying "not good." These three titles—**gū** (孤), **guǎ** (寡), and **bù gǔ** (不谷)—are terms people despise, yet kings and lords adopt them as their self-designation. This is because they cultivate humility and do not boast of their exalted status.

**Explanation:** The terms **gū** (孤), **guǎ** (寡), and **bù gǔ** (不谷) are not beautiful titles. Kings and lords base themselves on humility, so they use these unworthy and unlovely titles as their own designation and apply them to others. To **cultivate oneself** (自牧) is to nurture, as the *Yì* (易) **Qián** (谦) hexagram states: *"The modest and virtuous person, through humility, nurtures himself."* **Qián** (矜) means to boast. Those who hold positions of power but do not rely on arrogance, who lead yet do not harm others, will be joyfully followed by all without being resented. This is what it means.

The ancients said: *"The ruler who follows the Dao/Way delights in bringing delight to others, while the ruler who lacks the Dao/Way delights in his own pleasure. The one who delights others is cherished by the people and finds security in himself; the one who delights himself is hated by the people and meets his doom."* For one who governs the state and the people, should he not take warning from this?

**Commentary:** This is where they say "to base oneself on lowliness" (以贱为本). If one says this, is it not indeed to base oneself on lowliness?

**Explanation:** The **Lao Jun** (老君) wished to clearly demonstrate that nobility is rooted in lowliness, and that humility is the foundation of exalted status. Thus, he posed a question and answered it himself to emphasize this meaning.

There is a question, and there is an answer; there is a call, and there is a response. Just as a body is divided and its shadow appears, or a sound is made and its echo follows, the question and answer are a pretext to repeatedly stress the warning and exhortation. Therefore, he led to the discussion of counting carriages, yet there are no carriages.

**Annotation:** Counting carriages yet finding none is because the wheels and axles are the essence of carriages. Counting nobility yet finding none is because lowliness is the root of nobility. Wheels and axles are the basis of carriages—if the basis exists, carriages will be present; if not, there will be none. Lowliness is the root of nobility—if the root is preserved, one will have status; if not, one will have none.

This is said to warn kings and lords to base themselves on lowliness, so they should not neglect or abandon the solitary and vulnerable.

**Explanation:** The sages expounded on the **sutras/dharmas** (经) with many meanings. Sometimes they directly point to the truth of things, entering the path of principle without detour;

「Sometimes they use metaphorical language to convey profound meaning, aligning with the subtle and mysterious.

To clarify that the noble status of kings and lords is rooted in lowliness: wheels and axles are the collective names for carriages, yet the essence lies in preserving the wheels and axles to uphold the grand title of "carriage." Likewise, preserving humility ensures the exalted name of "kings and lords." If one does not forget its origin or abandon its root, then the grand title of "carriage" and the noble name of "kings and lords" will endure. What is said about "nobility without fixed form" means that from the beginning of chaos to the end of the Xia dynasty, changes were manifold—establishing titles and names, with virtue varying in quality, the world experiencing rise and fall, people’s fates differing, and customs diverging. Thus, there are times of profound silence, where no names or titles are set, and no virtue or status is recognized.

Even in cases where there is vast and boundless **Dao/Way** (鸿蒙) called "the **August** (皇)," or where there is the **mystic inundation** (潢然沐浴) called "Emperor" (帝), or where there is radiant clarity called "King" (王), or where there is broad influence and intermingling called "Hegemon" (霸), and below them, the ranks of **Marquis** (后辟), **Duke** (公), **Earl** (侯), **Viscount** (子男), **Minister** (卿), **Noble** (相), **Great Official** (大夫), and **Commoner** (元士)—all these titles arise with the times and are named according to the **era**. The distinctions of rank and status are varied, yet all are noble and govern the people.

Though they hold high positions and rule over others, they should not elevate themselves with arrogance or belittle others to exalt themselves. Elevating oneself leads to downfall; scorn for others brings danger to oneself. Instead, they should cultivate humility in their hearts and make self-restraint their aim.

Thus, the sages established titles and warnings, using terms like "solitary," "widowed," "orphaned," and "vulnerable" (孤、寡、不谷) to signify that nobility must not forget lowliness, and exaltation must not forget humility. Only then can they enjoy eternal blessings and lasting good fortune. Those who violate this principle have never failed to be forgotten.

Again, the saying "no carriages" (无舆) or "carriages without carriages" (车无车) points to the reality of carriages by examining their components—only when the parts like wheels, axles, and carriages are assembled does the whole become a "carriage." This aligns with the meaning in *Zhuangzi’s* **"Equilibrium of Yang"** (则阳篇), where the **Master Taigong** (太公) instructed **Young Zhizhi** (少知):

*"Unite the disparate to make them one, disperse the one to make them disparate again. Now, if you point to the hundred parts of a horse yet cannot find the horse itself, set the horse before you and gather its hundred parts to call it a horse. This shows that combining skin, fur, hoofs, and tails makes a horse, just as assembling wheels, axles, and carriages makes a carriage."*

Some say "praise without praise" (誉无誉) means that those seeking noble status should value sincerity over empty flattery. Though this meaning differs, it still carries the intent of warning and exhortation. The *Xiang Er* commentary further states:

*"Thus, the pursuit of praise leads to people craving fame. 'Praise without praise' means one should not let people be without their own lack of praise."* This parsing of the sentence also reinforces the warning and exhortation, urging individuals to be reverent and humble, to love others and care for all things, thereby following the teachings of the **Mysterious Primordial** (玄元).

They should not be dazzling like jade nor rough like stone.
**Annotation:** *Dazzling* (琭琭) refers to the polished appearance of jade; *rough* (硌硌) refers to the coarse texture of stone. The point is to remain rooted in lowliness.

The **Commentary** (疏) explains:

*"Jade is noble while stone is lowly. To be 'like jade' is to exalt oneself; to be 'like stone' is to humble oneself. Since kings and lords base themselves on lowliness, they should not be dazzling like jade—elevating themselves in nobility—but instead should be rough like stone, guarding their humility."*

The meaning is this: jade and stone are used to illustrate nobility and lowliness. Carriages and chariots are used to explain the gathering of many into one. These two sentences reiterate the warning that kings and lords should root themselves in lowliness.

The **highest virtue** (上德) of a ruler embodies the **Dao/Way** of the **Great Void** (太虚), concealing their appearance in **mystic stillness** (玄冥), acting with **gentleness and weakness** (柔弱), and remaining at **harmony and peace** (和平). They follow **rules and measures** (规矩), reflect upon the **Supreme Clarity** (太清), yet do not exalt themselves through titles or names.

In later ages, as virtue declines, rulers possess **nine-tiered nobility** (九重之尊), the **prestige of ten thousand chariots** (万乘之贵), the **wealth of the four seas** (四海之富), and the **prosperity of the six directions** (六合之殷). Their majesty rivals that of the **Heaven and Earth** (天地), their brilliance matches that of the **Sun and Moon** (日月), their decrees resemble the **cycles of cold and heat** (寒暑), and their awe-inspiring power mirrors the **thunder and lightning** (雷霆). Yet they do not take all beings as their concern nor reflect upon the lives of the people. They indulge in **excessive luxury** (繁奢), exalt themselves in grandeur, and though they hear the terms "solitary," "widowed," "orphaned," and "vulnerable," they do not grasp their true intent.

From the **First Emperor of Qin** (秦始皇), who devoured the world like a tiger and swallowed the **lords** (诸侯) like a whale, unifying all under heaven and dismissing the names "solitary," "widowed," "orphaned," and "vulnerable," he instead proclaimed, *"I"* (朕). *"I," "myself," "me," and "also"* (余、吾、我也) became his titles, losing the original intent of humility and instead displaying his **exalted arrogance** (尊大). From this point onward, rulers began to prize empty flattery, comparing themselves to **Emperor Yao** (尧) and **Emperor Shun** (舜) for honor. They scorned humble names, treating them like discarded tiles and stones. This path leads to **ruin and downfall** (辗败亡、践凋落), and it should be lamented deeply.

The **highest precepts** (太上格言) earnestly warn: one should remain **balanced between jade and stone**, neither too much nor too little, neither noble nor lowly. With **unity** (一) as the **foundation** (纪纲) and the **Dao/Way** as the **mainstay** (桢干), they govern the world with virtue yet do not claim ownership of it.

For those who embody **Dao/Way** in their conduct, their aspirations should be thus: to enjoy nobility without delight, to bear lowliness without sorrow, to ascend without peril, and to descend while ever more serene. How could one not strive for such attainment?

**Chapter 40: The Movement of Dao Through Reversal**

**Commentary:**
The preceding chapter warns against arrogance and rigid adherence by illustrating how Heaven and Earth achieve harmony through *One*. This chapter expounds upon the interplay of *power* (权) and *reality* (实), further elucidating the beauty of reversing the *Dao/Way*—for without arrogance, perfection is attained.

When nobility aligns with righteousness, only then may one employ *power*. To deepen understanding of the Dao’s essence, the principle of *emptiness-in-use* (冲用) is reiterated once more.

**Exposition:**
The Dao of *emptiness-in-use* is the subtle origin of all things. It encompasses both existence and nonexistence, permeating Heaven and Earth. Through it, Heaven and Earth attain tranquility and permanence; all things thrive and fulfill their nature. A ruler governing by the Dao’s transformation must practice *wuwei* (non-action), never clinging to titles or rigid dogma. Thus, he is warned: to base oneself in humility, lest one abandon the origin and lose the root. Therefore, *power* is demonstrated as a means to return to the root—harmonizing *emptiness-in-use* with mystical practice. This is the chapter’s core intent.

**Reversal is the Dao’s movement.**
**Annotation:** This elucidates *power*.
Reversal refers to aligning with the Dao while conforming to its principles. Reversing the conventional to harmonize with righteousness is the Sage’s exercise of *power*. To exercise *power* is to set the Dao in motion. Hence, it is said: *Reversal is the Dao’s movement*.
**Commentary:** Reversal signifies countering worldly norms; *movement* denotes transformation—speaking of *power* in the Dao. It is said that creatures cling to life yet lose the Dao through their attachment. Therefore, the Sage employs transformation and *power* to guide beings away from convention and toward the Dao.

**Exposition:**
When things conform to the Dao, they live; when they stray, they die. Why so? The Dao is naturally without action or doing; yet humans act and contrive. The Dao is without desire or emotion; yet humans crave and feel. Thus, convention opposes the Dao, leading one from life toward death.

The *Classic* states: *"Drive it to the brink of death, so that its vitality may flourish."* Again: *"Men lightly court death because their desire for life is excessive."* Therefore, those who court death through excessive desire for life—pursuing wealth, conforming to worldly norms, exhausting their nature, laboring their spirits, seeking glory and rewards—though these are meant to sustain life, they unknowingly transgress their proper measure and thus forfeit existence.

Master Wu said: *"Heaven and Earth nurture birds and beasts with feathers and fur, providing them with insects and grains. How much more so for humans?"* Though clothing and food are essential to life, one may entrust oneself to fate rather than frantically seek them. To fail in embodying the Dao and preserving life, yet surrender to fate and follow one’s destiny—this is to cling to life while losing the Dao.

If one abandons frantic seeking and rests in tranquil acceptance, aligning with serenity and contentment, life may yet be preserved. A ruler governs by nurturing the natural inclinations of things, aligning with Heaven’s timing, easing harshness to benefit the people, lightening taxes to nourish life, and refraining from territorial expansion or arms buildup. He avoids extravagant palaces and excessive bureaucracy, elevating all living beings to domains of longevity. Only then may one say they have reversed convention and followed the Dao.

**Commentary:**
The annotation states: *"Reversing the conventional to harmonize with righteousness"*—*conventional* refers to fixed norms; *righteousness*, to universal principle. Thus, nobility is rooted in humility, elevation in lowliness, and substance in emptiness. Initially, this seems contrary to natural inclination, yet ultimately it aligns with the Dao—hence, it is called *movement*.

**Exposition:**
*Conventional* refers to enduring principles, established as teaching yet unchanging. *Righteousness* refers to adaptable reason, applied flexibly as circumstances demand. The world values high status as weighty and lowliness as trivial, all aspiring to elevation while spurning humility, discarding lightness for heaviness. The *Classic*’s teachings declare that elevation is revealed through lowliness, nobility through humility—thus, humility becomes the foundation of nobility. Even sovereigns, though exalted, must not forget their origins; those who receive blessings endlessly must not forget their lowliness, lest they court peril. This is the Dao’s movement—turning worldly convention back to natural harmony.

**Commentary:**
Confucius said: *"One may stand with him, but not yet exercise power with him."* The Dao, reversing convention, is difficult to grasp. Thus, the analogy of the commoner is invoked: *"The *tángdì*’s* flower turns inward before unfolding—how could you not ponder it? Its chamber is distant."* This lost poem likens *power* in the Dao: first inverted, then aligned, first contrary, then harmonious. Those who think of a person yet cannot see them dwell in a distant chamber—likewise, those who ponder *power* yet fail to grasp the Dao dwell far from it. The Master said: *"You have not yet pondered it—how distant could it be?"* Meaning: in reversal, the failure to ponder is what makes it seem distant. If one ponders reversal, what distance remains? Thus, *power* is knowable through thought—only the unthinking fail to see. Thought follows its order, and thus it may be understood.

Therefore, *power* in the Dao is the ruler’s sharpest instrument. Its use requires the right person—one who reverses convention and aligns with the Dao. Without such a person, reversal becomes chaos.

**Weakness is the Dao’s application.**
**Annotation:** This elucidates *reality*.
*Weakness* signifies yielding, softness, receptivity, and stillness—these are the Sage’s true abode, the Dao’s constant practice. Hence, it is said: *Weakness is the Dao’s application*.
**Commentary:** This clarifies *reality* in the Dao. All revere strength yet despise weakness, unaware that rigid force and arrogance are the tools of convention.

「The Dao triumphs through harmonious softness over rigid hardness. Thus, it is known that yielding, softness, receptivity, and stillness are the Dao’s constant practice.

Therefore, it is said: *Weakness is the Dao’s application*.
**Commentary:** The Dao first embraces softness, yet convention reveres rigid strength. Softness preserves life, while rigid strength brings ruin. The *sutra* states: *"Those who rely on rigid strength shall not attain their natural end"*—I shall take this as my guiding principle. Holding to this teaching, one may guide people to abandon strength and embrace softness, to forsake agitation and return to stillness.

For teaching, there are two paths: *power* and *reality*. The superior scholar discerns *reality* and is instructed through it, naturally aligning in harmony with the Dao and attaining *Dao-wisdom*. The lesser scholar is awakened by *power*’s teachings—just as one who would take away must first give, to make them appreciate its value.

The Dao of governing lies in first cherishing the people, for the people are the foundation of the state and must never be abandoned. Yet in the ancient purity, the people aligned with the Dao, so *reality*’s teachings were applied. In the corrupt later ages, deceit and guile flourished, so *power*’s teachings were used instead.

*Power*’s teachings proceed as follows: first, lure them with the *Way* of goodness; if they do not comply, encourage them with favors and rewards; if encouragement fails, regulate them with laws and decrees; if regulation fails, threaten them with penalties and statutes; if threats fail, restrain them with punishments. These punishments are the five *criminal penalties*: branding the forehead and staining it black (*mòxíng*—ink punishment); cutting off the nose (*yìxíng*—nose punishment); castration for men and imprisonment for women (*gōngxíng*—prison punishment), prohibiting licentiousness; amputating the feet (*chùxíng*—foot punishment); and execution (*dàbì*—capital punishment).

For the five *criminal penalties*, first the testimony of both parties must be established. When both have been heard, judgment is passed among the five *executions*. If the five *executions* are not clear, punishment is applied among the five *penalties*. If the five *penalties* are not accepted, *offenses* are corrected among the five *transgressions*, and those not deserving punishment are pardoned. The faults of the five *transgressions* are balanced in guilt, and when doubt arises, punishment follows *criminal penalties*, while mercy follows *transgressions*.

When using punishments, one must still hold in awe the *Heavenly威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威威

「Nature and form arise together, both emerging and vanishing in unison—how could they rely on each other in sequence and thus differ?

It is not to say that shadows arise because forms move, or echoes emerge because sounds arise, but rather that all things respond to each other naturally, following the principle of mutual dependence.

The Dao/Way, through its wondrous and formless *qi* (氣化), gives rise to all things, and this is called *nature* (自然). The arising of things from things, and the generation of forms from forms, is called *cause-and-condition* (因缘).

Though the manifestations of things, whether grand like the heavens and earth or minute like insects, all depend on the Dao/Way’s wondrous *qi* (氣化) and its transformative power to come into being, yet they arise from forms and conditions, generating and completing each other in turn.

Those who cultivate the Dao/Way, letting their minds embrace the vast emptiness, holding fast to the One and returning to their original nature, can preserve their existing form and attain boundless longevity. When form aligns with the Dao/Way, it returns to the formless, adapting its transformations as fitting—death and life cannot burden it—then it may be said to have attained *self-sufficient existence and return to the void* (自有而归无).

Master Wu said: Those who cultivate the Dao/Way, the Dao/Way opposes the mundane. From oldness, they return to vigor; from vigor, they revert to infancy; from infancy, they attain the Dao/Way. This is what is meant by abandoning their coarse existence and returning to its wondrous void, restoring the original essence.

Ordinary people cannot perceive the Dao/Way’s original essence or exhaust its fundamental source, thus they fall into death, their transformations following the passage of time—this is truly lamentable.

The Sage pities them, establishing *temporary teachings* (權教) to guide them: to abandon excess and embrace frugality, to abandon falsehood and embrace truth, to abandon desire and action, and to practice *non-action and non-desire* (無為無欲). Following these temporary teachings, they gradually ascend to the true Dao/Way, silently attuning to genuine cultivation—then they may attain the Dao/Way.

Governance of the people relies on *temporary measures* (權), transforming the mundane through the interplay of *temporary and essential* (權實). The Dao/Way is likewise.

The commentary further states: The supreme Dao/Way is boundless and silent, transcending names and labels. All *dharma* (法) are inherently empty in nature, not dependent on each other. This means that the Dao/Way in its utmost essence is void and still, neither *temporary* (權) nor *essential* (實)—how could it be named?

All *dharma* (法) lack inherent existence in their true nature; they are neither present nor absent, and their essence is free from cause and condition. When it speaks of things arising from existence and existence from the void, it is merely a provisional explanation for the sake of discourse.

If one understands that *existence* (有) is *non-existence* (無) and *non-existence* (無) is *existence* (有), then one knows that all *dharma* (法) are empty and that emptiness transcends all *dharma* (法)—how could one speak of *temporary* and *essential* generating each other? Those who grasp this principle may be said to have truly awakened.

The meaning is this: The Dao/Way alone is boundless and silent, beyond naming. It follows the transformations of the age and guides the common folk through provisional teachings. These teachings are the *dharma* (法) themselves.

*Dharma* (法) are applied to people, leading them to abandon vice and embrace virtue. They are passed down to instruct the masses, with many practical applications—hence, it is said, *these are the dharma* (法). Through the *dharma* (法), one attains enlightenment in the Dao/Way; once enlightenment is gained, all *dharma* (法) are transcended.

Teachings establish *provisional methods* (權門); states propagate *provisional laws* (權法). The provisional serves to transform the common folk, eradicating their roots of evil. When evil is removed, the masses return to true principles. Following these principles leads to virtue, and the provisional laws are forgotten.

If one clings to the *temporary and essential* (權實) without letting go, or fixates on the teachings without reforming, then one cannot speak of the Dao/Way with them. Those who forget the *temporary and essential* (權實) and reach the Dao/Way may be said to have fully awakened and ascended to the true—transcending the age and attaining authenticity.

In the *Chuang Tzu*’s *Autumn Water* (秋水) chapter, the Sea Lord speaks to the River Spirit: Those who understand the Dao/Way must penetrate its principles; those who penetrate its principles must grasp its provisional methods; those who grasp its provisional methods will not let things harm themselves. This means that the Dao/Way follows eternal principles, while the provisional adapts to circumstances and establishes changes.

The enlightened one comprehends principles—who could harm them?

**Chapter 41: The Superior Scholar Hears the Dao/Way**

The commentary states: The previous chapter illuminated the dual aspects of *temporary and essential* (權實) as the Dao/Way’s dynamic functions. This chapter clarifies that the Dao/Way, though profound, is only fully grasped by the superior scholar through diligent practice.

Initially, it distinguishes the three types of scholars by their varying responses to the Dao/Way—faith or doubt—then establishes the *path of cultivation* (行門) for the inferior and the *path of virtue* (德) for the enlightened, concluding with the *benefits of proper guidance* (善贷) and its applications.

The meaning is this: The supreme principle is profound and mysterious; the inferior cannot fathom it. The Dao/Way’s clarity is obscured, only the wise can diligently practice it.

Since innate knowledge and discernment differ among people, their faith or doubt in the Dao/Way cannot be swayed—yet the key lies in setting forth provisional teachings to guide them toward virtue, lest they be trapped by their limited nature, seeking only to sink into ignorance without instruction.

Thus, the following passage opens the path to enlightenment, which is the function of proper guidance. The superior scholar hears the Dao/Way and practices it diligently.

The annotation says: Enlightenment leads to diligent practice.

The commentary states: The superior scholar, with deep insight and penetrating wisdom, hears the Dao/Way’s provisional teachings and understands their true essence—though the provisional appears subtle and the essential gentle, they practice it without pause.

Hence, it is said: *The superior scholar hears the Dao/Way and practices it diligently.*

The meaning is this: Though people are born with varying *qi* (氣)—some pure, some turbid—and differing natures—some wise, some foolish—though the Great Unity (大块) initially divides them, and the Original Essence (元精) nurtures all things, bestowing wealth, poverty, longevity, or early death, beauty or ugliness, all according to their fixed portions, these are given by nature and cannot be altered.

Yet the Dao/Way does not abandon any being; it always seeks to save them. Thus, teachings must be established to guide them, laws must be imparted to instruct them, so that they may awaken the confused and deluded, and penetrate the true and authentic.

This is like carving jade to make a vessel or sifting sand to find gold—such is the way.

As Confucius said: Those born with knowledge are the superior; those who learn and gain knowledge are the next; those who, despite their struggles, do not learn, are the lowest of the people. This aligns with the three scholars’ varying grasp of profound principles.

Again, in the *Analects*’ *Yong Ye* (雍也) chapter, it is said: The Master said: For those of average or above intelligence, one can speak of the superior; for those below average, one cannot. This refers to the methods of teaching and transformation.

The *Master’s Sayings* (師說) states: When dividing people by their innate qualities and discernment, there are three broad categories—superior, middle, and inferior. Further refined, there are nine ranks. The highest of the superior ranks are the Sages.

The Sage knows themselves and does not labor under the need for teaching. The lowest of the inferior ranks are the fools. The fool cannot be moved; teaching has no effect on them. Those who can be taught are the middle and inferior ranks below the superior, and the inferior ranks above the middle—seven ranks in total—who may be guided by instruction.»

What is meant by *"those of average or above intelligence can be taught the superior"* is that one speaks of the Dao/Way to those of the superior rank. This is how Confucius taught Yan Hui with the Dao/Way of the superior, and how Yan Hui taught Min Ziqian—thus, those of average or above intelligence can be taught the superior.

As for *"those below average cannot be taught the superior,"* they may still be taught the middle or those below it. For instance, Min Ziqian’s Dao/Way could teach those of the middle rank above, which is why even those of average rank can be taught the superior.

Again, teaching the middle rank above with the Dao/Way of the middle rank above, and the middle rank above with the Dao/Way of the middle rank below—this is how one teaches those of average rank the middle.

Further, teaching the middle rank below with the Dao/Way of the middle rank below, this is how one teaches those below average the middle.

And teaching the lower rank above with the Dao/Way of the lower rank above—this is how one teaches those below average the inferior.

This is a broad classification of those below average.

Since there are nine ranks, the fifth rank is the true average person. The second, third, and fourth ranks are superior, while the sixth, seventh, and eighth are inferior. Only the lowest of the inferior ranks, when taught, remain unmoved and laugh at the Dao/Way.

Master Wu said: The superior person knows without being taught; the inferior person, though taught, remains unmoved. The Dao/Way sets teaching for the average person.

The average person, when spoken to with virtue, inclines toward virtue; when guided toward vice, inclines toward vice. Thus, the purpose of teaching is to guide the average person, who may rise or fall.

The highest teaching entices through many methods, instructs in the virtuous Dao/Way, and gradually transforms them, freeing them from ignorance and delusion, so they may enter the path of progress and virtue. Thus, no person is abandoned.

The superior person naturally attains enlightenment, so their practice is unremitting.

The average person, upon hearing the Dao/Way, is uncertain—sometimes receptive, sometimes not.
*Note: The average person may rise or fall, hence their uncertainty—sometimes receptive, sometimes not.*
*Explanation: The average person’s clarity and obscurity are undetermined. Upon hearing the profound Dao/Way, they may believe or doubt. If clear, they are receptive and faithful; if obscure, they doubt or reject it. Without firm resolve, they are swayed by worldly desires—lured by wealth and status, bound by gain and loss, entangled in pleasures, indulging in arrogance and excess. Hearing the silent Dao/Way, who would labor to cultivate it? Thus, they blind themselves to the five colors, deaf to the five sounds, lost in emotion and drowned in nature. If they could instead fear evil as touching scalding water, crave virtue as if it were beyond reach, acknowledge faults and amend them, emulate the virtuous and strive to equal them, abandoning the average’s indulgences and following the superior’s path, they could ascend to the lofty and attain the void.*

The inferior person, upon hearing the Dao/Way, laughs derisively.
*Note: They are deluded and disbelieving, hence the laughter.*
*Explanation: The inferior person’s understanding does not grasp the principle. Hearing the Dao/Way, they dismiss it as false, scoffing in ridicule—just as the *zhāngfú* hat was deemed vulgar by the Yue people, or the jade *hé* was discarded in Chu. Hence, Zhuangzi said, *"The perverse scholar cannot be spoken to of the Dao/Way."*

*Explanation: The derisive laughter comes from the foolish and ignorant, whose dull minds cannot comprehend the words of the Sage. Though they hear, they do not understand; though they see the teachings of the ancient kings, they do not recognize them. This is what is meant by *"their understanding does not grasp the principle."*

Hearing the true and authentic Dao/Way—how it generates heaven and earth, nurtures the cosmos, encompasses yin and yang, and weaves the transformations of nature—how it prolongs life through self-cultivation and governs the realm with effortless virtue—yet they dismiss it as absurd, laughing in unison. Hence, it is said they laugh derisively.

The *zhāngfú* was the cap of Zhou and Lu. The Yue people were the states of the Hundred Yue. In ancient times, Yu the Great tamed the floods, reaching as far as the eastern barbarians, whose descendants settled there and established their state. Their ancient custom was to wear their hair unbound and tattoo their bodies, until Goujian subdued Wu and they began to assimilate with the Central Plains.

The *zhāngfú* being held in no esteem, it was not a cap they would cherish—thus, it is said, *"to degrade you thus."*

The *hé pǔ*—Coyness and Crudeness—refers to Běn Hé, a man of Chu.
Dwelling beneath the Jing Mountains, he found a jade rough-hewn (*yù pǔ*) and presented it to the Chu king.
He sent artisans to examine it, who declared it stone, accusing him of deceit, and had one foot severed.
Thus, through two successive kings, he presented it twice more, losing both feet.
Běn Hé wept, clutching the rough-hewn jade beneath the Jing Mountains, until the Chu king, hearing of it, summoned him. The artisans carved the stone and found jade within, which the king then treasured.
Later, it passed into Zhao, then into Qin.
When the Qin Emperor unified the realm, abolishing feudal states in favor of commanderies and prefectures, he had the jade carved into the *transmission seal of state*.
It is said that only when Běn Hé presented his rough-hewn jade three times did the ruler of his time recognize its worth.
Thus, it is said, *"he was cast aside in Chu."*

In the *Zhuāngzǐ* [*Qīu Shuǐ*], Hǎi Ruò spoke to Hé Bó, saying:
*"A well-frog cannot be spoken to of the sea—it is confined to its pit.*
*A narrow scholar cannot be spoken to of the Dao—he is bound by doctrine."*

By *narrow scholar* is meant one who clings to the partial views of a single school, entangled in contrivance.
Hé Bó, relying on the autumn floods’ surging flow, did not know his own smallness.
Hǎi Ruò said:
*"The waters of the world have none greater than the sea. All rivers flow into it, yet one does not know when it will cease to fill;
its outlet drains it, yet one does not know when it will cease to empty.
Spring and autumn remain unchanged, and it knows no drought or flood.
Its surpassing the currents of rivers and streams cannot be measured.
Yet I have never boasted of this—
I take form within heaven and earth, drawing qi from yin and yang.
The four seas, as they exist between heaven and earth, are but a drop in the great marsh.
Though the customs of the Yue hold the cap in contempt,
and Chu cast aside the rough-hewn jade,
though the Qin Emperor engraved his seal upon it,
and the Central Plains donned its adornments,
setting the standard for later kings,
unifying the six directions—
what degradation is there in the *hé pǔ* and *zhāngfú*?

The principles of transformation and nurture adapt to circumstances, teaching as the moment demands.
The Dao leads to goodness, guiding toward the right path."*

The lowly scholar, though most foolish,
may still speak of the Dao.

If it does not invite laughter,
it is not worthy to be called the Dao.
**Annotation:** If it is not laughed at by the lowly scholar,
it is not worthy to be the profound and mysterious Dao.

**Commentary:** The profound Dao is deep and unknowable,
bright yet like darkness, its logic contrary to common sense—
thus it provokes laughter.

If it is not laughed at by the lowly scholar,
it has not yet reached the subtle essence—
merely a shallow, vulgar method,
unworthy to be called the Dao.
The Dao is not a law for the ages,
so it is scorned by the common and foolish.

Thus it is the true wondrous Dao.

**Meaning:** The Dao is hidden and returns,
silent and serene, its mystery profound.
It does not bind people with rigid judgment,
nor does it display itself in brilliant form.
Those who embody the Dao walk likewise—
within, they align with emptiness,
without, they blend with dust and filth.
Thus, though supremely bright, they appear as darkness,
unseen by the masses.
Is it not that they also follow the customs,
guard humility, and dwell below,
so the lowly scorn and laugh at them?
Yet even the Sage, in concealing his person and refining his Dao,
is not free from the lowly’s laughter,
for he has not yet fully attained the Great Dao.

**Meaning:** To govern the realm and transform customs,
one must also be clear and unassuming,
allowing things to unfold naturally,
with kindness and gentleness subtly spread,
and benevolence flowing without trace.
Thus its people rise with the sun and rest at dusk,
dull and silent, unaware of the Emperor’s power,
unaware that there is a ruler above them.
Though the common folk know not the Emperor’s might,
the Sage’s virtue extends far,
and the mysterious winds pervade all—
this is the ultimate transformation.

**Establishing this teaching:** **Annotation:** *Jiàn* means "to establish."
Before setting forth this teaching,
it clarifies the three types of scholars’ differing relations to the Dao.

**Commentary:** *Jiàn* means "to establish."
Before establishing this teaching,
it explains the diligent practice of the superior scholar,
the fluctuating grasp of the middle scholar,
and the cause of the lowly’s laughter.

**Meaning:** The Sage of the Highest Order
establishes this teaching to reveal the Dao,
and to explain why the three types of scholars differ—
thus this passage.

**Brightness like darkness:**
**Commentary:** *Míng* means "illuminated."
*Mèi* means "dim."
The virtuous practitioner
nourishes brightness through darkness,
discards form and abandons wisdom,
yet remains truly illuminated.
Thus it says "brightness like darkness."

The superior scholar practices diligently,
yet outwardly appears as dim—
the lowly do not understand,
so they laugh.
The middle scholar, upon first hearing of the bright Dao,
appears to grasp it—
later, as he fails to comprehend,
it seems as if he has lost it.
**Meaning:** The Sage who rules by the Great Dao
embodies the Dao and remains,
his spirit merging with transformation,
dwelling in the natural.
All things follow their true nature,
with no perception or awareness.
His essence aligns with the Dao’s mystery,
his life attuned to the subtle One.
His actions accord with the Great Harmony,
his taking and discarding with Heaven’s principle.
Without thought or deliberation,
he is silent and vast as the Original Chaos.
Equal to the sun and moon in their radiance,
yet the people do not recognize it as brightness.
Balanced in the rain and dew’s favor,
yet the people do not see it as grace.
Though supremely bright,
he appears as darkness and silence.

The superior scholar refines the Dao,
conceals wisdom and dims his splendor,
contains perception and hides knowledge,
turning his gaze inward while outwardly appearing as a helpless infant.
This is beyond the middle scholar’s grasp,
and the lowly deride it with laughter.
As for the fluctuating grasp of existence and loss,
it is also a form of dimness.

Again, it speaks of Heaven’s virtue—
though resplendent above,
it is ever as darkness and dimness.

**Advancing in the Dao like retreat:**
**Commentary:** Those who advance in the Dao
do not stir within,
forget all external affairs,
daily diminish their worldly concerns,
yet achieve greatness as if lacking.
The lowly observe them and think them in retreat.

**Meaning:** The Sage who upholds the Great Dao
lets the world be as the Original Chaos,
unifies the four seas into one,
pursues only what diminishes,
never adding to his own affairs.
He acts little, guards few things,
yet his people are loyal and sincere,
the world harmonious and simple.
The ruler is like heaven and earth,
the people like grass and trees.
He does not prize the myriad chariots as honor,
nor the ninefold palaces as joy.
Humble and weak, he appears to retreat,
tranquil and yielding, without desire—
yet his Dao spreads widely,
his virtue vast and boundless—
this is the Dao of retreat.

The superior scholar applies this principle to himself,
and though his hidden virtue is subtly manifest,
he does not boast or display it.
His deeds are unseen, his merit unrecognized,
yet he yields goodness to others,
retreats from his own name,
and though his alchemical talismans are not proclaimed,
his refined essence ascends in fame.

Li Yiqi begged for food among the world,
Yin Changsheng endured humiliation in the marketplace,
Hou Huanyu dwelled in obscurity as a servant,
Huangfu Shitai feigned illness in the hills—
Shengzi accompanied the mad,
Fu Gong concealed his brilliance.
All humbled themselves and diminished their pride,
yet these were the very means by which they cultivated their true nature.

Again, it speaks of Earth’s virtue—
though it steams below,
it is ever humble and retreating.

**The Dao’s simplicity like its flaws:**
**Annotation:** The superior scholar’s diligent practice
makes him appear as if advancing like retreat,
and as if his simplicity has defects.

Thus the middle scholar doubts,
and the lowly laugh.

**Commentary:** *Yí* means "level."
*Zhǎn* refers to uneven threads in silk.
The mind is clear and pure,
with no attachment to dust or desire,
truly level and easy,
boundless with all things—
yet outwardly, it seems as silk with uneven threads.

**Meaning:** Silk without flaws
is used by people.
Fine as *Zhēn* and *Liàn*,
delicate as *Wùgǔ* and *Yúnluó*—
all enter the realm of transformation,
forgetting their original nature,
until they fade and dissolve,
no longer silk at all.

People who abandon the Dao
are driven by the vulgar world,
each competing for wealth and rank,
indulging in sounds and colors,
wandering in evil paths,
losing their true nature,
until they sink and perish,
no longer preserving their lives.

The enlightened scholar, in refining himself,
is inwardly level and easy,
yet outwardly blends with the dust,
endures suffering while meeting joy,
adapts to the times and follows their traces—
like silk with its flaws.

Zhongni, the Sage of great virtue,
yet felled trees and marked his passage,
traveled to visit the states of the world;
Xuan Yuan, the Sage of supreme honor,
yet knelt at the pillar and hid his writings,
refined his Dao in distant lands.
Though inwardly they harbored the ultimate Dao,
outwardly they appeared as silk with flaws.

Again, it speaks of the ruler’s virtue—
though he follows Earth’s pattern and Heaven’s law,
he does not dare to stand out,
always appearing as if he had flaws.

The highest virtue is like a valley.
*[Annotation: Empty yet receptive, containing all things.]*
*[Commentary: The diligent practitioner of the Dao is called one of highest virtue—his virtue is fully manifest, yet contains all without distinction, hence "like a valley."]*
*[Meaning: The sagely ruler rests in boundless mystery, veiling his form in profound obscurity, embodying the Dao and containing virtue without limit. The vastness of myriad states is held within his breast, yet he does not rely on his own possession; all things transform spontaneously within his domain, yet he does not boast of its greatness. How could one liken this to a valley?*
*[Also: The ruler bears defilement as a valley receives filth.]*

The superior man embodies virtue and the Dao without omission—thus it is so.

Great purity is like shame.
*[Annotation: Pure yet bearing defilement.]*
*[Commentary: "White" means pure; "shame" means dust and filth. Those who attain pure Dao blend with the common, hence "like shame," yet remain truly pure and complete.]*
*[Meaning: The virtue of Yao and Tang was supremely bright, yet they endured calamities like Shixiang’s floods and the melting of stones—times when the people faced no hunger or famine. Even the purest white bears dust. The practitioner of the Dao, outwardly stained like a man of lowly station or a beggar, conceals his sharp teeth and sword-like demeanor, sinking his traces like a submerged spring, while inwardly perfecting his Dao, blending with the muddy world—this too is its meaning.]*

Broad virtue is like insufficiency.
*[Annotation: Great achievement yet practicing humility.]*
*[Commentary: The sage’s virtue extends without limit, yet he guards softness and practices humility, ever appearing insufficient.]*
*The* Records of the Grand Historian *says: "A skilled merchant hides his wealth as if empty; the man of great virtue appears foolish in bearing."*
*[Meaning: The ruler of highest virtue transforms the Nine Regions without relying on his own virtue—they transform of themselves. Unaware of his deeds, he seems ever insufficient. The practitioner of the Dao accomplishes both hidden and manifest deeds, his virtue extending to all creatures; ceaseless in his labors, tireless in his virtue, yet ever appearing insufficient.]*
*The* Records of the Grand Historian *also recounts: When Confucius and Nanrong Jingzhu visited Zhou, they asked about rites from Laozi. Laozi said: "What you speak of belongs to a man whose bones have long since decayed—only his words remain. I have heard: A skilled merchant hides his wealth as if empty; the man of great virtue appears foolish in bearing. Remove your arrogance and greed, your artificial manners and licentious desires—they profit you not. This is what I tell you."* *[This was Laozi’s reproach to Confucius for his pedantic teachings in the Three Bonds and Five Constants, which obscured the Great Dao, preferring instead the artificiality of rites and propriety—like a merchant who hoards treasure yet feigns emptiness.]*

Established virtue is like theft.
*[Annotation: Accomplishing deeds without boasting.]*
*[Commentary: "Established" means accomplished; "theft" means secretive. Those who cultivate hidden virtue act stealthily, as if stealing—fearing discovery, hence "like theft."]*
*[Meaning: The ruler who bestows virtue and practices the Dao nurtures it secretly among the people, neither boasting nor vaunting, ever serene and still, so that the world remains unaware—thus "like theft." The superior man in cultivating himself ever holds to secrecy, hence this meaning.]*
*[Also: "Theft" means meager.]*
*In the* Analects *[of the] Great Brother [section], Confucius said: "When a gentleman is devoted to his kin, the people rise to benevolence. If he does not neglect the old, the people will not be meager."* *[Zhu Xi’s commentary: "Rise" means to awaken. If a ruler is generous to his kin, all will follow, awakening to benevolent deeds, and none will be meager.]*
*[This speaks of those who establish hidden virtue—their deeds, if effective, are accomplished without seeking fame; their goodness, if done, is not pursued for its own sake. Wuzi said: "The merit is not in its grandeur, but in rescuing what is encountered."]*

True substance is like flowing water.
*[Annotation: Pure unity and harmonizing light.]*
*[Commentary: "True" means pure unity; "flowing" means transformation. The practitioner of virtue and the Dao is pure and unadorned, yet seems to flow and transform with things, blending like waves and harmonizing light.]*
*[Meaning: "Substance" is simplicity; "true" is purity. The pure and simple, adapting to all things, is not confined to one corner—it seems to flow and transform. The Great Square has no corners.]*
*[Annotation: Not rigidly establishing sharp edges.]*
*[Commentary: "Square" means upright; "corner" means angle. To polish one’s principles as a sharp corner is the way of those bound by teaching—not the way of the great and boundless. Polished yet not rigid, in mud yet unstained—this is the Great Square, yet it harmonizes light and blends with dust, having no corners. Hence it is said: The Great Square has no corners.]*
*[Meaning: The ruler of supreme Dao possesses boundless virtue, containing all without limit, encompassing the void yet not claiming greatness, spanning Heaven and Earth yet not asserting distance—like the phoenix soaring into the boundless or the dragon ascending the layered skies. How could corners measure such vastness? The superior man expounds the Dao differently from the scholars, unbound by names and ranks, unconstrained by rigid principles. His breadth is boundless, like the great void; his aspirations are vast, like the distant wild goose. Unstained, unrigid—this is his state.]*
*In the* Analects *[of the] Yanghuo [section], Fuchui summoned Confucius. Confucius wished to go, but Zilu said: "Earlier, I heard the Master say: 'If one close to the ruler is personally unvirtuous, the gentleman will not enter.' Fuchui rebelled against Zhongmou—how can you go?" Confucius said: "Indeed, there was such a saying. But it does not say 'unyielding.'"*

The grinding does not wear thin—does it not say, *"white"*?
The dyeing does not blacken—black, indeed, is but superficial.
The most firm of things, when ground, does not thin.
The most white of things, when dyed, does not blacken.
This illustrates the gentleman: though in a turbid age, he cannot be defiled.
The Sage is not stained by the vulgar—like the most firm and most white of things.

The conduct of the superior man, the virtue of the Sage,
is indeed unbound by any fixed measure.

Great vessels take time to form—
*Note: they do not seek swift results.*
*Citation: "Instrument" refers to what serves all things.*
Because of their lateness, they attain greatness—
thus, the superior man diligently accumulates deeds and virtues,
realizing them gradually, not in a single day or night.
Hence, *"late formation."*
*Meaning:* Accumulating harmony to become a man,
accumulating deeds to attain the Dao—
not achieved in a morning or evening,
thus *"late formation."*

The ruler who governs by the Dao
embraces non-action,
relies on natural course,
dim and indistinct yet not scrutinizing,
pure and unadorned yet not ostentatious,
leaving things to their nature—
and thus all within the Four Seas arrive at the Dao.

Those who cultivate their essence,
accumulating deeds and virtues—
is this not so?

Hence it is said:
*"When merit reaches three thousand, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight;*
*Expounding the Dao without end, one attains immortality by oneself.*
*Not achieved by morning’s journey to reach evening’s goal."*

The instruments that serve the use of things are called *qi*—in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Ding of the ninth year of his reign, in summer, Yang Hu returned treasures: the *huang* of the Xia dynasty, the *fanruo* jade of Fengfu, and a great bow. These were recorded as *"obtained"*—they were instruments of use. In general, to acquire instruments of use is called *"obtained,"* and to obtain use is called *"acquired."*

Thus, *instruments* are that which serves the use of things.

The *Great Sound* is rare in voice.
*Commentary:* It does not adorn with trivial tales.
*Exposition:* The Dao can respond to all sounds—this is the *Great Sound*; listening to it yields no voice—this is *rare in voice*. By analogy, when the Sage expounds the *One Vehicle*, the law-sound spreads widely, awaiting sentience to respond, hence *"rare in voice."*

*Meaning:* The *Great Sound* is like thunder—it cannot be struck by the four seasons. The Sage’s subtle intent cannot be proclaimed all day long. This illustrates that the Dao cannot be heard. One must extinguish wisdom and seek within, burying the heart in silence, then listen not with the ears but with the spirit, attaining the sound of no-sound and verifying the True Dao.

*The One Vehicle* is the Dao of the *Great Vehicle*.
The Dao permeates all dharmas and manifests as the Three Vehicles. Initially, the law restrains the mind with precepts, regulates conduct with rules, cultivates stillness within, and maintains purity and solemnity without. Yet, gradually advancing along the Middle Way, one practices non-action, demolishes the body and dulls the senses, forgetting form and severing thought. Then, ascending to the practice of the *Great Vehicle*, one extinguishes in stages, forgetting with each thought, unobstructed by presence or absence, buried in the Middle Way.

Those who realize this Dao refine the mundane to attain immortality, transcend the world to deliver beings, soaring above inverted illusions, enjoying boundless years. Though heaven and earth may decline, the True Dao remains unaltered, its law-sound encompassing all, rescuing and delivering all beings. This is the Sage’s use of the *One Vehicle*.

The *Great Image* is formless.
*Commentary:* Thus it can respond to all kinds.
*Exposition:* Those who dwell in form and instrument become fixed in one aspect. Only the Dao of the *Great Image* is originally formless and qualityless, responding to sensation and shaping all forms. Hence, *"the Great Image is formless."*

*Meaning:* The *Great Image* is the Dao. The Dao is not an image—how could it be grasped as the clear and pure forming heaven, the turbid and thick forming earth, the great forming the sun and moon, the small forming stars and constellations, all visibly manifest? One must only reverse vision and illuminate within, containing light and clarity, then perceive the color of no-color, behold the form of no-form. The Dao alone is the *Great Image*—silent and void, formless, yet capable of generating all forms, carving all images. All generated and transformed beings exist within the *Great Image*. Only those who attain the Dao can glimpse its portents.

The Dao is hidden and nameless.
*Commentary:* Its function is not manifest; it is nameless.
*Exposition:* Speaking of its universal generation, one might call it the Dao, but forgetting its function renders it hidden and nameless. To clarify its name and proclaim its body, yet its essence is formless—its body cannot be named, hence *"the Dao is hidden and nameless."*

*Meaning:* The Dao has no name or designation, originally no law. Since there is no law, it is said to be hidden. One who forgets the forced names can ascend to the myriad mysteries. The Dao generates all things yet does not boast of its function—this is forgetting its function. The Dao responds to all yet does not rule as sovereign—this is being hidden and nameless. Thus it is called the *Image of No-Image*, the *Dao of No-Name*. Without reversing the spirit and inwardly discerning, how could this be spoken of?

Only the Dao is kind in lending and perfecting.
*Commentary:* Though hidden and nameless, it truly excels in pure, harmonious, and wondrous use, lending and nurturing all things, perfecting them.
*Exposition:* This concludes the Dao’s function. *"O"* is deception; *"unique"* is singular. *"Lending"* means bestowing. This praises the Dao—though nameless and without lineage, formless and voiceless—it alone can diffuse *qi* and transform, lending to all things and perfecting them, hence *"kind in lending and perfecting."*

*Meaning:* The Dao’s function is ceaseless generation, boundless operation. From the finest hair to the myriad classes, all rely on the Dao’s *qi* and borrowing to then be able to generate and perfect. *"Lending"* is borrowing from things. Nameless and without lineage, it is the root of all things; voiceless and formless, it is the source of all beings. It diffuses *qi* in all directions, perfecting everything. Without the wondrous origin of the Dao, who else could achieve this?

「#1 **Virtue/power must be cherished as weighty**, **guilt must be regarded as light**: According to the *Shàngshū* (Classic of Documents), both *"**virtue/power** must be"* and *"**guilt** must be"* should be read as *"**virtue/power** should be doubted"* and *"**guilt** should be doubted"* (i.e., *"**virtue/power** should be discerned with caution"* and *"**guilt** should be discerned with caution"*).

**Moral Teachings of the Daoist Canon: Broad Explication of the Sacred Text, Volume Thirty-Three**
Narrated by Master Táng Guāngchéng (Du Guangting) of the Táng Dynasty
**Commentary on Chapter Four: "The Dao Generates One"**

In the previous chapter, it was explained that the Dao heard by the Three Worthies can generate all things. This chapter elucidates that the origin of all things’ generation and transformation must rely on the Three *Qi* (Heavenly Breaths). First, it speaks of the **Yīn* and *Yáng*-conciliating *Qi* (Chōng* *qi*)**, gentle and weak, allowing all things to embrace it for harmony. Next, it states *"the solitary and bereaved lack nourishment"* (gūguǎ bùgǔ), warning rulers to practice humility in their conduct. It concludes with *"the fierce and overbearing do not meet their end"* (qiángliáng bùdé qí sǐ), demonstrating the principle of cultivation.

**Meaning:** Heaven and Earth cannot generate themselves—Heaven and Earth are the great Dao. When the great Dao operates, **Oneness** is the primary principle, hence *"The Dao Generates One"*, clarifying the Dao heard by the Three Worthies in the previous chapter. Though the Dao is **Oneness**, the foolish and the wise hear it differently, thus there are those who believe and those who doubt, some who are diligent and others who scoff, revealing the Dao’s distinctions of clarity and obscurity, advancement and retreat, and guiding the world in cultivation.

It further expounds on the method of *"nourishing and humbling"* (gǔ rǔ), illustrating the conduct of the Superior Worthies in humility. Since it was said that the Dao *"kindly lends to all things"*, it is evident that all things embrace the Dao to be born. Thus, humility and lowliness are the foundation of *"nourishing"*—to diminish is to benefit. The nature of the fierce and overbearing, however, is that to benefit them is to harm.

The necessity of relying on the Three *Qi* is as described in the *Língbǎo Shēngshén Zhāng* (Scripture of the Soul’s Treasure on Generating the Spirit), which states: *"**Xuan* *qi*, **Yuan* *qi*, and **Shi* *qi** are the three primordial breaths."* **Shi* *qi* (the Breath of Commencement)** is white, congealing into the **Pure Void Heaven** (Chōngwēi Tiān), known as the **Jade Purity Realm** (Yùqīng Jìng), where the Lord of Heavenly Treasures presides, and the **Venerable Sovereign of the Primordial Beginning** (Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn) governs the Nine Holy Ones.

**Yuan* *qi* (the Primordial Breath)** is yellow, congealing into the **Yu Remnant Heaven** (Yǔyú Tiān), known as the **Uppermost Purity Realm** (Shàngqīng Jìng), where the Lord of the Soul’s Treasure presides, and the **Lord of the Great Dao** (Dàdào Jūn) governs the Nine Truths.

**Xuan* *qi* (the Mysterious Breath)** is green, congealing into the **Great Purity Realm** (Dàqīng Jìng), known as the **Great Red Heaven** (Dàchì Tiān), where the **Most High Venerable Lord** (Tàishàng Lǎojūn) governs the Nine Immortals. These three breaths each generate three more, forming the **Nine Heavens** below, and together with the three realms, they constitute the **Twelve Heavens**. Further, each of the Twelve Heavens divides into two, totaling the **Thirty-Six Heavens**.

Moreover, their essence congeals into the **Three Talents** (Sāncái): **Shi* *qi*** becomes Heaven, **Xuan* *qi*** becomes Earth, and **Yuan* *qi*** becomes Humanity. **Shi* *qi*** accumulates **Yáng** (Heavenly), **Xuan* *qi*** accumulates **Yīn** (Earthly), and **Yuan* *qi*** accumulates the **refined essence of Yīn and Yáng** (Yīnyáng zhī huá), forming all human relationships and dispersing into myriad things.

The **Yīn* and *Yáng*-conciliating *Qi* (Chōng* *qi*)** is the **Yīn* and *Yáng*-harmonizing, mysterious, and pure breath**—all things obtain it to live, and lose it to die. If humans treasure it, they can reverse aging and return to infancy, abandoning mundanity to attain the Dao. The meaning of *"the solitary and bereaved lack nourishment"* was already explained in the previous chapter. The **fierce and overbearing** (qiángliáng) further demonstrate that gentleness and weakness are the **Dao’s true path**.

The *Lúnyǔ* (Analects) states: *"The use of rites is to achieve harmony."* Thus, harmony is the **Way** to ascend the Dao—it must not be overlooked.

*"The Dao Generates One, One Generates Two, Two Generates Three,"*
**Annotation:** *"**One**" refers to the **Yīn* and *Yáng*-conciliating *Qi* (Chōng* *qi*)**.*
The Dao moves and produces the **refined, harmonious, and mysterious breath** (Chōnghé miào* *qi*)**. Though this breath suffices for generating things, it is still insufficient for the principle of transformation, so it further generates **Yáng* *qi* (Heavenly Breath)**. **Yáng* *qi*** cannot generate alone, so it further generates **Yīn* *qi* (Earthly Breath)**. The accumulation of the **Yīn* and *Yáng*-conciliating *Qi* (Chōng* *qi*)** as **One** is why it is said *"**One** Generates **Two**"*. The accumulation of **Yáng* *qi*** as **Two** is why it is said *"**Two** Generates **Three**"*. **Three** Generates All Things,
**Annotation:** *"**Yīn** and **Yáng** intermingle in gestation, the **Yīn* and *Yáng*-conciliating *Qi* (Chōng* *qi*)** harmonizes, and then all things flourish and are perfected."* Hence *"**Three** Generates All Things."*

**Commentary:** The Dao is the **ultimate, formless, and mysterious divine origin**. **One** is the **refined, harmonious breath**. *"Generate"* means *"to move and produce"*. It states that the Dao moves and produces the harmonious breath to generate things, yet for the principle of transformation, this is still insufficient. It further generates **Yáng* *qi***, accumulating **Yáng* *qi*** to complete **One**, hence called *"**Two**."* Pure **Yáng* *qi*** cannot generate alone, so it further generates **Yīn* *qi***, accumulating **Yīn* *qi*** to complete **Three**, hence called *"**Three**."* *"**Three** Generates All Things"* means that **Yīn** and **Yáng** intermingle harmoniously, the **Yīn* and *Yáng*-conciliating *Qi* (Chōng* *qi*)** transforms purely, and then all things universally flourish and gather. This clarifies the Dao’s *"kind in lending and perfecting"* and its principle of generation and perfection.

**Meaning:** Though the Dao is formless and nameless, it is neither nonexistent nor all-encompassing—it naturally transforms wondrously to generate **Oneness**. **Oneness** is the Dao’s offspring. Heaven obtains it to be pure, Earth obtains it to be tranquil, humanity obtains it to endure, and all things obtain it to be born. Thus, those who cultivate this wondrous **Oneness** must guard it, embrace it, and preserve it, obtaining it as the **root of verifying the Dao**.

The **Oneness** mentioned is the **Breath of Commencement** that becomes Heaven. *"**One** Generates **Two**"* is the **Mysterious Breath** that becomes Earth. *"**Two** Generates **Three**"* is the **Primordial Breath** that becomes Humanity. Thus, the **Yīn* and *Yáng*-conciliating *Qi* (Chōng* *qi*)** generates **Yīn** and **Yáng** in harmony, congealing the **refined essence of Yīn and Yáng** to form the **pure and impure bodies**. Then, all human relationships are complete, all classes of things are without omission, the four seasons harmonize, and the five phases operate in their forms. If they intermingle and follow the Dao, then things preserve their constancy. If they are blocked and contrary, then things suffer calamities. Hence, the *Zhōuyǐ* (I Ching) depicts **Qián** (Heaven) below and **Kūn** (Earth) above as **Tài** (Harmony). *"Heaven and Earth intermingle, and all things transform purely"*—when **Yīn** and **Yáng** intermingle harmoniously, all things flourish and gather. In the *Yǐ*, it is said: *"Heaven and Earth intermingle in harmony, and all things transform purely."* If **Yīn** and **Yáng** do not intermingle, Heaven and Earth are isolated and blocked, forming **Pǐ** (Opposition) in the *Yǐ*. *"Heaven and Earth do not intermingle, and all things do not transform purely"*—when **Yīn** and **Yáng** do not intermingle, the world lacks order, and things cannot generate and transform. Hence, the commentary states: *"**Yīn** and **Yáng** intermingle harmoniously, the **Yīn* and *Yáng*-conciliating *Qi* (Chōng* *qi*)** transforms purely."* The *Yǐ* says: *"Heavenly and Earthly breaths intermingle in harmony, and all things transform purely."*」

All things bear **Yīn** upon their backs and embrace **Yáng** within their arms, relying on the **Chōng* *qi** to achieve balance.

**Note:** All things derive their fullness from the harmonizing **Chōng* *qi** of **Yīn** and **Yáng**, thus bearing and embracing **Yīn** and **Yáng**, nurturing and sustaining the **Chōng* *qi** to maintain softness and harmony.

**Commentary:** In speaking of the generation of things, since they are fully nurtured by the harmonious **Chōng* *qi** of **Yīn** and **Yáng**, they must bear the **Yīn** and embrace the **Yáng**, cherishing the **Chōng* *qi** to maintain softness and harmony.

Thus, the Master Guāngchéng instructed the Yellow Emperor: *"I preserve the **Chōng* *qi**, embracing its harmony, which is why I have cultivated my body for twelve hundred years without ever declining."* This shows that the **Chōng* *qi**—the harmonious interplay of **Yīn** and **Yáng**—is the foundation upon which all life depends.

The **Lǎojūn** (Laozi) emphasized this to illustrate that since humans are born with harmonious **Chōng* *qi**, **Qi** is the root of life, and one must firmly uphold softness and harmony, guarding **fēi ruò** (the feminine/weak) to preserve the **Qi**’s essence.

**Explication:** All things are generated by the **Dao/Way**’s **Qi**, nurtured and sustained by the **Yīn** and **Yáng**. In a single day and night, **Yīn** and **Yáng** alternate, fostering all things. In its grand aspect, **Yīn** manifests as cold, **Yáng** as heat. In its subtle form, **Yáng** brings light, **Yīn** darkness. Through cycles of cold and heat, light and obscurity, day and night, all things take shape and grow. Without the harmonious interplay of the **Dao/Way**’s **Qi**, they cannot be generated.

Even if cold and heat exist without the **Dao/Way**’s **Qi**, things will wither and fall. The two **Qi** alternate as inner and outer, thus all things bear them and embrace them, inseparable.

When humans are born, the **Dao/Way** descends its **Yuán yī** (primordial unity) **Qi** to form their essence and spirit; Heaven grants them the **Tàiyáng** (Great Yang) **Qi** to move and breathe; Earth imparts its pure **Yīn** **Qi** to shape their form and substance. The *Sūtrā on Life and Spirit* states: *"Once born, humans possess eighteen thousand Heavenly spirits and eighteen thousand Earthly spirits, totaling thirty-six thousand spirits."* The **Qi** generates form in a single moment—what faces it is **Yáng**, what turns away is **Yīn**. Hence, *"All things bear **Yīn** upon their backs and embrace **Yáng** within their arms."*

How profound! Humans live between Heaven and Earth, awe-inspiring yet awe-struck, nurtured by the Three **Yuán** (Primordial Breaths) and shaped by the Nine **Qi** (Nine Breaths), with myriad spirits in reverent submission, following the **Sīmǎ** (Marshal) in respectful order. The **Tianzhēn** (Heavenly True) nature reflects and upholds them, and the **Tàiyáng** **Qi** elevates their form without delay. Yet, once born, humans cannot honor their **Qi**, cherish their form, preserve their life, or nurture their spirits. They invite decay and death, severing themselves from their true essence—how painful!

In the *Zhuāngzi*’s *"□ in Yòu"* (Lost in the chapter title), the Yellow Emperor asked the Master Guāngchéng on **Bāntóngshān** (Mount Kùndūng): *"What is the method of preserving one’s body so that it may endure long?"* The Master Guāngchéng rose and said: *"Excellent question! Let me tell you. The essence of the **Dao/Way** is profound and mysterious, its utmost limit obscured and silent. It has no visible form, no audible sound. If you embrace the spirit and remain still, your body will naturally align. Be still and clear, do not weary your form, nor agitate your essence—thus you may attain longevity. If your eyes see nothing, your ears hear nothing, and your mind knows nothing, your spirit will guard your form, and you may attain longevity. Beware of excess within, close off excess without—too much knowledge leads to ruin. I have led you to the realm of the Great Brightness, the origin of **Yáng**. I have brought you into the gate of profound mystery, the origin of **Yīn**. Heaven and Earth have their functions, **Yīn** and **Yáng** their repositories. If you guard your body with care, all things will flourish of their own accord. I preserve the **Chōng* *qi** and dwell in its harmony, which is why I have cultivated my body for twelve hundred years without ever declining."*

The Master Guāngchéng was the embodiment of the **Tàishàng** (Supreme Uncarved), appearing in the world to teach the **Dao/Way** to emperors and kings. How could he be subject to the cycles of life and death? The twelve hundred years are metaphorical. Again he said: *"Those who attain my **Dao/Way** ascend as **Huáng** (Emperor), descend as **Wáng** (King). Those who lose my **Dao/Way** are exalted in brightness above, reduced to dust below."* Again he said: *"Humans may all perish, but I alone endure."* This is the attainment of the **Chōng* *qi**’s harmonious mystery.

What humans detest are the terms **gū** (Lonely), **guǎ** (Few), and **bùgǔ** (Unfulfilled), yet kings and nobles adopt them as titles.

**Note:** All things take the harmonious **Chōng* *qi** as their foundation, and the **Chōng* *qi** is soft and weak. Those who preserve the foundation must practice humility, gentleness, and weakness.

**Commentary:** Since the **Chōng* *qi** is soft and weak, it is the root of life. Thus, the example of kings and nobles practicing humility reinforces this principle. The terms **gū**, **guǎ**, and **bùgǔ** are names of deficiency, not titles of honor. Yet kings and nobles take them as names, demonstrating the utmost humility. They are the leaders of moral cultivation, the guardians of life and death, and all under Heaven look to them. If they do not uphold humility and gentleness to ensure the stability of the state, the people will not follow. Thus, they take humility and gentleness as their foundation to achieve the **Wēiwēi** (Awe-inspiring) efficacy of governance.

**Explication:** Those who uphold softness and weakness will live without depletion. Those who embrace humility and restraint will rise without peril. Therefore, softness and weakness are the primal elements of preserving life, and humility and restraint are the fundamental roots of maintaining elevation. Hence, great states should act as the lowest, and high platforms must be firmly grounded. This is the constant of adhering to the **Dao/Way**, the essentials of establishing one’s self—yet humans cannot follow it.

In the *Máo Shī*’s *"□ in Xiǎoyǎ*’s *Jiē Nánshān"* (Lost in the chapter title), it is written: *"Majestic is the Master Yǐn, all the people look to him."* Though he holds a high position as a teacher and official, he can propagate moral cultivation and nurture the people.

The *Shī Xù* states: *"The rulers above cultivate moral influence upon the people below."* The *Lúnyǔ* says: *"The **virtue/power** of the **junzi** (noble) is like the wind, the **virtue/power** of the **xiǎorén** (petty) is like the grass."*

「The wind over the grass must surely bend it.
This means the people follow and comply with the moral influence of their superiors.

When rulers and nobles uphold **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**, the people from all quarters flock to their moral influence, hence the saying "return and follow" (归往).
The *Commentary of Zuǒ* states: "The people’s return and follow is what makes one a **Wang** (King)."

If **Wanggōng** (rulers and nobles) have the **Dao/Way**, their achievements are grand and lofty,
like the unshakable firmness of mountains—
thus it is said: *"Majestic and towering are their achievements"* (巍巍乎其有成功).
**Wēiwēi** (Majestic) describes great height and grandeur.

Therefore, some things may be diminished yet bring gain, or increased yet cause loss.
*Annotation*: Those who diminish themselves are benefited by others; those who seek gain are diminished by others.

Hence, those who attract universal reverence are skilled at humility,
and the gentle and yielding hold the reins of **virtue/power**.
Is it not fitting that the lonely and humble be praised?
*The Exegesis* says: **Gù** (故) continues the context of the previous passage.
**Shǔn** (损) means to defame or disparage.
It speaks of rulers and nobles declaring themselves lonely and humble to selflessly diminish their reputation,
and thus the people gladly promote them, respecting and serving them,
which brings them greater benefit.
But if they seek gain and are diminished,
such as when rulers and nobles indulge their own bodies with luxury,
act arrogantly in their high positions,
the people below will scatter and abandon them,
leading to their downfall.
The *Shū* (Classic of Documents) says: *"Fullness invites loss, humility invites gain."*
This is what is meant.

**Yì** (义) states: *"To govern a state, one must found it upon humility and brightness;
to establish oneself, one must prioritize gentleness and yielding."*
The *Yìjīng* (Classic of Changes) says: *"Modest and modest, the **junzi** (noble) preserves himself through lowliness."*
If one acts contrary to this,
he will surely suffer loss.
The *Yìjīng*’s *Explanation of the Hexagrams* states:
*"If one is too lenient, he will surely lose something,
thus the hexagram is followed by **Pǔn** (损).
If loss continues unchecked, gain will follow,
thus it is followed by **Yì** (益).
If gain continues unchecked, it will lead to excess,
thus it is followed by **Guài** (决).
Then loss and gain alternate in dependence,
their beginning and end following one another in sequence.
If one’s humility does not cease,
things will always bring him gain,
and thus he will never face ruin.
Those who cultivate the **Dao/Way** forsake splendor and luxury,
abandon extravagance and embrace simplicity,
reject pleasure and endure solitude—
their self-diminishment is extreme.
Yet when they attain the **Dao/Way**,
they prolong their blessings and enjoy long lives,
living carefree and effortlessly,
equal to the eternal harmony of Heaven and Earth—
is this not the greatest gain?"*

The *"Fullness invites loss"* passage is found in the *Shàngshū* (Classic of Documents) □*Dàyǔ Mó*□ (Great Yǔ’s Admonitions):
Shùn (舜) said: *"Consider you, Yǔ,
for at this time the Máo people do not comply.
Go and pacify them with an expedition."*
Yǔ then assembled the leaders of all tribes,
swearing to his troops and leading an expedition against them.
After three months (三旬),
the Máo people rebelled against his rule.»

The **Yǔ** praised **Yǔ** and said:
*"Only virtue moves Heaven—
no distance it cannot reach.
Fullness invites loss,
humility invites gain—
this is the **Dao/Way** of Heaven."*

**Yǔ** bowed in response and said, *"Indeed."*

Then the Emperor spread his **virtue/power** in splendor,
dancing the *Gān-Yǔ* at the two tiers,
and in seventy years, the Máo people submitted.

Thus, governing the realm and cultivating oneself,
humility is the foundation.

What the Sage teaches,
I too teach as my principle.

**Annotation:** The **Laozi** says:
*"When a ruler seeks to establish teachings for the people,
he must instruct them with my principle of gentle, yielding, and humble virtue."*

**Exegesis:**
*"People"* refers to the ruler.
The ruler stands at the head of governance and education—
the winds of the entire realm depend on one person’s transformation.
Thus, the **Laozi** expounds:
*"When a ruler seeks to instruct the people through words,
he must use my principle of gentle, yielding, and humble virtue to teach them."*

**Doctrine:**
Is there not the ruler as the root of governance and transformation?
The ruler is the *yuánshǒu* (元首).
The *Shàngshū* says:
*"The ruler is enlightened, his ministers steadfast—
all affairs prosper!"*
This speaks of the ruler’s virtuous instruction.

Again it says:
*"The ruler is fragmented and trivial,
his ministers slack—
all affairs collapse!"*
When the ruler is fragmented and trivial, lacking vision,
his ministers grow lax, and all affairs decay.
This speaks of the ruler’s flawed instruction.

Governance and education originate with the ruler—
how can one not be cautious?

The *Shījīng* says:
*"The affairs of a realm rest on one foundation—
this is called *fēng* (wind).
The affairs of the world manifest in the four directions’ *fēng*—
this is called *yá* (elegant).
*Fēng* and *yá* are rectification.
This speaks of the rise and fall of royal governance."*

When a ruler teaches with humility, gentleness, and yielding,
the people become sincere and return to the **Dao/Way**.
When he governs with harshness and rigid scrutiny,
the people grow cunning and descend into chaos.

For those who cultivate themselves:
humility and stillness simplify their tasks,
tasks simplified bring peace of mind—
then life is preserved.
Agitation and striving multiply affairs,
affairs multiplied distance one from the **Dao/Way**.

*"Chāng"* means "great."

The strong and overbearing do not meet a natural death.

**Annotation:**
The strong and overbearing clash with all things.
Seeking gain, they incur loss—
things may bind them—
thus they do not die a natural death.

**Exegesis:**
*"Strong and overbearing"* refers to those who are rigid, violent, and obstinate.
Such rigid, violent men neglect the essentials of nurturing life,
and thus cut short their natural end,
dying before their time.

**Yán Xiānshēn** said:
*"Strong Qin perished through tyranny,
Great Han flourished through harmony."*

**Doctrine:**
What the **Laozi** warns is this:
gentleness overcomes rigidity,
weakness overcomes strength—
thus the tongue, though soft, endures,
while the teeth, though firm, perish.
Therefore, strength and overbearingness are not the **Dao/Way** of self-preservation,
but the foundation of losing one’s life.
Rigidity and violence are not the path to the **Dao/Way**,
contrary to the principle of safeguarding life—
this must be deeply heeded.

**Yán Xiānshēn** was **Yán Zhūn** of Shǔ Commandery,
courtesy name **Jūn Píng**,
who practiced divination in Chéngdū,
subtly transforming people.
When questioned improperly, he would refute them with *yīnyáng* principles.
He earned a hundred coins daily, then closed his shop,
lowering his curtain to receive the *Laozi*,
and composed *Zhǐguī* (Pointing the Return) in tens of thousands of words,
clarifying the essentials of governing the realm and cultivating oneself.

In interpreting this doctrine—*"Strong Qin perished through tyranny"*—
he said:
*"Qín Shǐhuáng devoured the seven states,
unifying the world,
dominating the four quarters,
and relentlessly wielding slaughter—
he violated the **Dao/Way** of humility and yielding,
thus his lineage collapsed with Child **Yīn**,
and he did not die a natural death.
This is indeed true."*

The **Qín Yíng** clan,
descendants of **Zhuānxū**’s son **Bóyǐ**,
down to **Fēichū** and **Zhōu Xiàowáng**’s horsekeeper,
were enfeoffed between the **Wéi** and **Jīng** rivers.

The **Píng Wáng** moved eastward, and **Qín Shǎnggōng**’s aid to him earned great merit,
thus he was granted the status of a feudal lord among the *Zhūhóu*.

By **Mù Gōng**’s time, he humbled the commoners and employed the worthy,
gaining **Yóuyú**, **Zǐ Sāng**, and **Bǎilǐ Xī**,
and thus his realm grew powerful and flourished.

In the **Zhāo Wáng**’s fifty-first year, he attacked **Zhōu**,
seizing the Nine Cauldrons and precious treasures,
thirty-six cities, and relocated **Zhōu** to **Dàn hú**.

**Zhāo Wáng** died shortly after,
and **Xiào Wén Wáng** was hastily enthroned.
He died within a year,
and **Zhuāngxiā Gōng**’s son **Chǔ** was enthroned.
He died after three years,
and **Shǐhuáng** was duly enthroned.
From the first year, **Yìmǎo** (Year 1, 2nd month, 4th day),
to the twenty-sixth year, **Gēngchén** (Year 26, 7th month, 1st day),
he pacified the feudal lords,
extinguished the Six Kingdoms,
and proclaimed himself **Shǐhuáng**.

In the thirty-eighth year, he died,
and **Hú Hài** succeeded him as **Èrshì**.
He died after three years,
and **Yīn** succeeded him.
After forty-six days, he surrendered to **Hàn** at **Zhǐdào**.

**Xiàng Yǔ** arrived, beheaded him,
and the realm perished.

**Hàn Zǔ** **Liú Bāng**, styled **Jì**,
a native of **Fēng Pèi** in **Péngchéng**,
rose from humble origins,
advancing the worthy and employing capable men,
clashing with **Xiàng Yǔ** in fierce battle to claim the realm.
With his **virtue/power**, he subdued mighty **Chǔ**,
and his benevolence extended to all living beings.
Cunning scholars plotted for him,
and virtuous men aided him,
three great ministers secured his imperial legacy,
and his laws, though few, brought rest to the weary.
He possessed the noble bearing of a magnanimous elder,
and his lineage endured through the Two **Hàn** dynasties,
twenty-four emperors, and over four hundred years.
His descendants ruled **Shǔ** for two generations as well.
This is the proof of **gentle virtue/power** overcoming strength.

The **Dao/Way** of cultivating oneself and governing the realm
is indeed worthy of reflection.

**Commentary:**
The strong and overbearing lose the **Dao/Way**,
while the harsh and violent lose their **qi/spirit**.
The **Way** of life dictates retreat,
how else can one achieve lasting existence?

**Annotation:** *"动与物亢"*—*"亢"* should be *"敌"* (enemy).

Some may strike against you—
the *Yì* **Yì** (益) hexagram’s ninth line states:
*"Mo yì zhī, huò jī zhī"* (No benefit from excess, some will strike you).
Its meaning is:
Those who govern through strength and tyranny perish in their realm,
while those who cultivate themselves through strength and overbearingness lose their lives.
To resist and oppose others is to court misfortune.
Some may strike against you—
the *Yì* **Yì** (益) hexagram’s ninth line says:
*"Mo yì zhī, huò jī zhī"* (No benefit from excess, some will strike you).
It refers to those who exceed the limits of benefit,
who are overfilled.
Seeking endless benefit,
this is a heart without constancy or satisfaction,
while others refuse to grant it—
singing alone without harmony,
this is the language of extremism.

Mankind detests excess,
and resentment arises from many quarters,
thus some strike against you.
**Yì** means "granting,"
**jī** means "injuring."
The **qi/spirit** is the master of life,
while humanity is the master of the **qi/spirit**—
they rely upon each other;
if one is missing, the other perishes.
Using harshness loses the **qi/spirit**,
thus it is not good.
I shall make this my guiding principle.

**Annotation:** *"吾见强梁者亡，柔弱者全"*—
I have observed that the strong and overbearing perish,
while the gentle and yielding endure,
thus I shall take this doctrine of gentleness and yielding
as the foundation of all teachings.

**Commentary:**
"Foundation" means "root."
This sentence concludes the essence of cultivation.

**Lǎo** **Zūn** (Laozi) raises the perishing of the strong and overbearing as a warning,
and the enduring of the gentle and yielding as encouragement.
To make this the foundation of all teachings,
it is like the son to the father—
thus I say, *"I shall make this the foundation of all teachings."*
Its meaning is:
The father is the honored one.
Gentleness and yielding must endure,
and they are honored above all teachings.
Even the lesser teachings place humility and gentleness first,
thus the *Yì* says:
*"Qián zūn ér guāng, bēi ér bùkě yú"* (Humility brings honor and radiance, lowliness is unassailable).
It means that the honored can humble themselves and shine even brighter,
while the lowly, through humility, remain secure and uncrossable.

The *Lǐ* (礼) says:
*"Ào bùkě cháng, shèn yǐ bì huò"* (Arrogance cannot long endure, be cautious to avoid disaster).
*"Gōng yǐ yuǎn chǐ, jìngràng yǐ xíng"* (Reverence keeps shame at bay, respect and yielding guide action).
All speak to the essence of humility and caution.

The *Shàngshū* (尚书) says:
*"Yuàn ér gōng"* (Genuine and reverent).
*"Qián yuàn ér gōngkè yě"* (Sincerely humble and reverent).
*"Róu ér lì"* (Gentle and steadfast).
*"Hé róu ér lì shì yě"* (Harmonious and gentle in governing affairs).

The *Shī* (诗) says:
*"Jìng gōng ěr wèi"* (Steady and reverent in your station),
a call to guard gentleness and respect.

The *Chūnqiū* (春秋) says:
*"Shǐ zhī yǐ hé, lín zhī yǐ jìng, xíng zhī yǐ lǐ, shǒu zhī yǐ xìn, fèng zhī yǐ rén, jiào zhī yǐ wù, xián zhī yǐ yì"*
(Lead them with harmony, govern them with respect,
act with propriety, uphold trust,
reward with benevolence, instruct with diligence,
restrain with righteousness).
The Classics say:
*"Bīng qiáng bù shèng"* (A strong army does not conquer),
*"Mù qiáng zé gòng"* (A strong tree is prone to splitting),
*"Qiáng dà chǔ xià"* (The mighty are placed low),
*"róu ruò chǔ shàng"* (The gentle are placed high),
*"gāo zhě yì zhī"* (The high are humbled),
*"xià zhě jǔ zhī"* (The low are raised).

All these teachings place gentleness, yielding, humility, and respect as their foundation.
To establish this as the foundation of all teachings—
how could it be in vain?

The **Dao/Way** of governing the world,
cultivating oneself,
and upholding gentleness with humility—
none will fail to submit.

**Chapter 43: The Supreme Softness of the World**

**Commentary:**
The preceding chapter reveals how all beings stray from the Dao/Way, and how arrogance and force meet their end. This chapter teaches that true nature is soft and weak—when cultivated, it aligns perfectly with the Dao/Way. Though the paths diverge, their essence converges. It begins by establishing the fundamental softness of human nature, which, when lost, becomes hardened and rigid. Later, it demonstrates how the Dao/Way of *wuwei* (non-action) brings boundless benefit, surpassing all teachings.

**Exposition:**
Having shown in the previous chapter how arrogance and force meet their end, this chapter reveals that the loss of supreme softness becomes supreme rigidity. It displays the benefits of *wuwei* and further illuminates the advantages of *buyan* (non-speech). It seeks to guide people away from rigidity toward softness, to embrace the Dao/Way’s essence without attachment, to enter subtlety from coarseness, and to deeply grasp the origin of the Dao/Way.

The supreme softness of the world
overcomes the supreme rigidity of the world.

**Annotation:**
The supreme softness of the world is the true nature.
If one indulges in worldly affairs, becomes entangled in dusty realms, and is overwhelmed by desires, then it becomes the supreme rigidity.

**Commentary:**
Human true nature is inherently pure and clear, with harmonious *qi* dwelling within—this is supreme softness. But if one indulges in desires, clings to worldly defilements, and is seduced by sensory pleasures, the true nature scatters, becoming supreme rigidity.

**Exposition:**
The Dao/Way, in its supreme softness, permeates all things, flowing through all forms. To attain it is to live; to lose it is to die. Thus, preserving and nurturing the Dao/Way ensures life’s completeness and softness, while dispersing one’s *qi* leads to withering and rigidity.

In governing a state with the Dao/Way,
one returns to *rén* (benevolence) with simplicity.
Without the Dao/Way,
even within the home, enmity arises.

Those who cling to the dust of defilements—
this refers to the six senses arising from the six consciousnesses,
the six consciousnesses indulging in the six emotions,
and the six emotions generating from the six desires.

The six desires are called the six dusts (*liú chén*),
the six dusts are called the six defilements (*liú rǎn*),
the six defilements are called the six gates (*liú rù*).
From the senses they arise, with defilements varying in lightness and heaviness—
all must be cultivated and gradually mastered.

Thus, the primary concern in refining the body is:
to sever the eyes from the five colors,
the ears from the five sounds,
the nose from the five fragrances,
the mouth from the five flavors,
the body from the five tactile stimuli,
and the mind from the five afflictive bonds—
then the six dusts are purified.

When the six dusts are purified,
worldly gains cannot perturb,
sounds and colors cannot seduce,
and one naturally returns to the Dao/Way of supreme softness—
how could there be the calamity of rigidity?

There is no entering the *wújiān* [无间].
**Commentary:**
*"No"* refers to when a person awakens to all dharmas,
possessing nothing at all,
then returning to the true nature,
merging with the Dao/Way,
and entering the *wújiān*.

The *wújiān* is the Dao/Way.
"Entering" means merging with the Dao/Way.
To call the Dao/Way *wújiān* is to clarify its pure and clear nature,
boundless and seamless, without gaps.

**Exposition:**
Heaven and Earth have defined forms and positions—
clarity and turbidity differ.
Yin and Yang have distinctions—
darkness and brightness differ.
Qi and phenomena undergo transformations—
the four seasons differ.
Yet the Dao/Way encompasses Heaven and Earth,
penetrates Yin and Yang,
embraces the four seasons,
regulates phenomena—
nowhere is the Dao/Way absent,
hence it is called *wújiān* [无间].

If a person merges their spirit to perceive the subtle,
returns to the One and reverts to the Origin,
resting becomes human,
dissolving becomes *qi*,
and unifies with the Dao/Way—
eternally preserved, never perishing—
riding the harmony of *wúyǒu* [无有],
entering the *wújiān* Dao/Way—
how could the four seasons move it,
or life and death constrain it?

Thus, I know the benefit of *wúwéi* [无为].
**Annotation:**
*"Wúwéi"* means not clinging to dusty realms,
leaving the mind empty of all attachments.
*"Wújiān"* refers to the Dao/Way’s pure nature,
its wondrous body seamless and unified—
without gaps.
Not being disturbed by cravings,
cleansing both mind and realm,
possessing nothing at all,
then the mind merges with the Dao/Way,
entering the *wújiān*.

Hence the Sage said:
*"I see the body and mind pure—
then able to merge with the Dao/Way."*
Thus, it is known that the teachings of *yǒuwéi* [有为]
are not as beneficial as *wúwéi*.

**Commentary:**
*"I"* is Laozi speaking of himself.
This chapter also universally admonishes rulers to govern with *wúwéi*,
so Laozi says:
*"I see that all beings’ true nature is soft and weak,
yet when they indulge in reckless striving,
they become supremely rigid.
If one illuminates and awakens to mind and realm,
possessing nothing at all,
then they merge with the Dao/Way."*

Thus, it is known that purity and *wúwéi*
benefit both self-cultivation and governance.

Extending this reasoning,
the teachings of *yǒuwéi* are not as beneficial as *wúwéi*.

**Exposition:**
Laozi’s teachings emphasize *qīngjìng* [清静] as practice,
and *wúwéi* as the essence.
*Píngjìng* brings national prosperity and personal tranquility,
*wúwéi* accomplishes the Dao/Way and transforms humanity.

The Dao/Way is *wúwéi*—
Heaven and Earth are perfected through it,
all transformations unfold through it,
and all things are born through it.

Heaven and Earth act through *wúwéi*—
the four seasons cycle through it,
the six *qi* harmonize through it,
and the eight winds stir through it.

The Sage empties the heart to return to the Dao/Way’s virtue,
calms the *qi* to preserve spirit and clarity,
reduces hearing to the soundless,
blocks vision to the formless,
observing Heaven and Earth’s transformations,
witnessing all things’ natural unfolding.

Thus, it is known that *yǒuwéi* disrupts,
while *wúwéi* governs.
The nature of supreme softness is inherently *wúwéi*,
while the calamity of rigidity arises from indulgence.

Ceasing indulgent desires,
restoring the softness of *wúwéi*,
to teach all under Heaven—
the Dao/Way’s expansive benefit is vast.

Those who illuminate and awaken to mind and realm—
their divine mysteries are unfathomable.
Internally, they scrutinize the One Mind,
with wondrous applications boundless.
Externally, they forget all phenomena.
Governing the state, they forget what they govern;
cultivating the self, they forget what they cultivate.
Piercing the void, merging with the Dao/Way—
this is called *nèiguāng* [内照], the essence of inner illumination.

The teaching of *wúyán* [不言] and the benefit of *wúwéi*—
few under Heaven can attain it.
**Annotation:**
Few among the myriad schools can equal *wúwéi*’s teaching.

**Commentary:**
The supreme Dao/Way is beyond words—
all things are born through it.
The Sage acts through *wúwéi*—
transformation is pure through it.
Thus, no need for established teachings to arise.

Few under Heaven can attain it—
meaning among the nine schools and a hundred lineages,
few can equal *wúwéi*’s teaching.
Or again: unless a ruler embodies the Dao/Way,
none can attain it—
hence, "few."

**Exposition:**
A ruler governs through *wúwéi*,
and the people transform through spontaneity.
What more need be said?

The utmost subtlety of *wúwéi*
encompasses virtue and the Dao/Way,
unifies *rén* (benevolence) and *yì* (righteousness),
harmonizes with *lǐ* (ritual) and *yuè* (music),
regulates *xìn* (faith) and *zhì* (wisdom),
embraces all conduct,
confines the two poles—
its breadth is boundless,
its subtlety seamless,
congealed in silent profundity,
mingling with the Dao/Way—
this is the ultimate of *wúwéi*.

The nine schools—
as recorded in the *Han Shu*:
The Daoist school makes the spirit unified,
actions merge with the formless,
sufficient for all things.
Its methods follow Yin and Yang’s great order,
adapting to time’s shifts,
responding to phenomena’s transformations,
rooted in purity and emptiness to preserve itself,
humble and weak to sustain itself—
this is the art of a ruler facing south.

The Confucian school emerged from the Minister of Education.
It aids the ruler in clarifying teachings,
revering the ancestors of Yao and Shun,
establishing constitutional models from Wen and Wu,
venerating Confucius as master,
transmitting his words—
this is its highest virtue.
Yet it may lose subtlety, becoming eccentric,
or fluctuate with time, deviating from the Dao’s root.
If it seeks only to deceive the masses for favor,
it becomes the affliction of later, perverse scholars.

The Logicians emerged from the Spring Bureau.
Since names and positions differ,
rituals also vary in number.
Confucius said: *"Must one not rectify names?"*
This is their strength.
But if they twist it,
they merely hook words and split hairs.

The ruler must be cautious with tools and names, hence it is said:
*"Names and tools must not be entrusted to others."*

The **Strategists** emerged from the **Ambassador’s Bureau**.
Confucius said: *"When sent to the four quarters, one must not speak alone."*
Again he said: *"Sent! Sent!"*
Their strength lies in adapting to circumstances, accepting commands without questioning words.
But if they act deceitfully, they abandon sincerity for trickery.

The **Eclectics** arose from the **Council Bureau**.
They combine Confucianism, Mohism, and the Schools of Names and Laws—this is their strength.
Yet if they indulge in it, they lack true devotion.

The **Agriculturists** stem from the **Agricultural Bureau**.
They sow the five grains to ensure clothing and food.
The *Hongfan* [Eightfold Government] states: *"One is food."* This is their virtue.
But if the vulgar practice it, they would force even the noble to till the fields.

The **Novelists** originate from the **Minor Officials**.
*Bai* means millet—small grain.
The sovereign, desiring to know customs, established the *Minor Officials* to gather street and alley discussions.
Confucius said: *"Though minor teachings, there is much to observe; neglect them, and governance may falter."*
This too is the meaning of the rustic and the madman.

The **Mohists** emerged from the **Sacred Hall’s precincts**—
thatched halls with wooden beams,
where selected scholars gathered in reverence.
The **Yin-Yang School** arose from the **Celestial Bureau**.
The Five Phases doctrine makes people overly constrained.

The **Military School** came from the **Marshal’s Bureau**.
Its purpose is to deter disorder and uphold cultural virtue,
to combine weak states and attack the ignorant,
to suppress rebellion and pacify the four quarters—
this is its might.
*"To cease war is martial virtue,"*
and martial virtue has seven virtues,
assisting culture in governance.
The Way of culture and martial arts must not be abandoned.

The **Hundred Schools**—
beyond the Six Classics and official histories—
each composed their own treatises.
From the Zhou onward, over a hundred scholars established doctrines and wrote books,
all called *Zi* [Master].
*Zi* is the general term for men.
Daring not to rival the Six Classics,
they were styled *Zi*, *Lun* [Treatise], *Ji* [Records], or *Shu* [Book],
or named by surname, or by era—
such as *Yuzi*, *Zengzi*, *Yanzi*, *Mengzi*, *Guanzi*, *Xunzi*,
*Lu Lianzi*, *Liezi*, *Zhuangzi*, *Gengsangzi*, *Wangsunzi*,
*Yinwenzi*, *Gongsun Nizi*, *Lushi Chunqiu*, *Dengxi Zi*,
*Guiguzi*, *Lu Jia*, *Chao Cuo*, *Jia Yi*, *Huan Tan*,
*Cui Zhi*, *Zhou Sheng*, *Liezi*, *Wei Lang*, *Ren Xia*,
*Pei Xuan*, *Su Yan*, *Fu Xuan*, *Tang Pang*, *Qin Jing*,
*Ruan Wu*, *Shang Jun*, *Mouzi*, *Fu Lang*, *Sun Wu*,
*Fan Shengzhi*—these are among them.

Some adopted separate pseudonyms—
*Zisizi*, *Taigong*, *Jingu*, *Huainanzi*, *Yantielun*,
*Shuoyuan*, *Xinxu*, *Lunheng*, *Qianfutun*, *Fengsutong*,
*Wenzi*, *Shenjian*, *Changyan*, *Dianlun*, *Dulun*,
*Zhonglun*, *Wanjilun*, *Zhongjing*, *Yilin*, *Daoyanlu*,
*Shiji Ji*, *Jiiji Ji*, *Faxun*, *Wujiao*, *Shukao*,
*Dingyu*, *Zhengshu*, *Zhenglun*, *Wulilun*, *Hanzi*,
*Renwuzhi*, *Chengbaizhi*, *Tonglun*, *Zhengbu*,
*Shiwei*, *Tongyu*, *Guoyu*, *Yuejueshu*, *Baopuzhi*,
*Shiyao*, *Xinlun*, *Xiyan*, *Youqiu*, *Changlezi*,
*Jialu*, *Taixuanjing*, *Fangyan*, *Fayan*, *Zhilin*,
*Sou Shenji*, *Bowuzhi*, *Yixun*, *Shanhai Jing*,
*Shuijing*, *Dayang Ji*, *Shizhou Ji*, *Shiyilu*,
*Bencao*, *Xiangniujing*, *Xiangmajing*, *Xianghejing*,
*Zhoupai*, *Zhupu*, *Sunzi Bingfa*, *Sima Bingfa*,
*Sunzi Suanjing*, *Huangshigong Ji*, *Xiangbeijing*,
*Wanbi Shu*—these are among them.

Some delved into mystical scriptures,
others explored Confucian rituals and texts,
some adhered to laws, calendars, and astronomy,
others attached themselves to Yin-Yang symbols and divinations,
some constrained themselves by Names and Laws,
others relied on cunning and expedience—
each displaying their strengths,
mutually presenting their natural and artificial methods.

Some alternate between relaxation and tension,
each fixated in a narrow corner,
few achieving comprehensive understanding.
By such measures, none can attain the Dao of *Wuwei*.

Only the sovereign who embodies the Dao,
the ruler of supreme virtue,
whose mind is without concern,
whose spirit is without thought,
whose actions seem formless,
whose stillness is absolute—
harmonizing with the Dao,
vastly open and unrestricted—
can follow the footsteps of the Mysterious Origin,
and trace the path of the Great Clarity.

**Chapter 44: On the Proximity of Names and the Body**
*Explication:*
The previous chapter clarified the proper nature of gentleness and strength.
This chapter elucidates how the proximity of names and wealth
and the concealment of love and hatred bring misfortune.

**Chapter 44: On the Proximity of Names and the Body**

First, three lines pose the question: *Who suffers more, loss or illness?*
Next, two lines elaborate on the causes of misfortune,
and finally, the admonition to contentment and moderation
is given to ensure enduring well-being.

**Explication:**
Wealth is the resource of the body,
renown its adornment.
To be ensnared by wealth brings the guilt of self-destruction,
to be drowned in fame invites the calamity of ruined life.
Hoarding wealth and craving renown—these are the greatest afflictions.

The Venerable Master pitied the world’s delusion in clinging to fame and wealth,
unaware of how they bring suffering.
Thus, he first poses three questions,
then answers with two lines,
demonstrating the virtue of contentment
and urging the abandonment of covetous love.
His solicitude for all living beings is profound indeed.

**Who is closer to the body—name or wealth?**
*Annotation:* Name is the guest of substance.
Asking who is closer, he urges abandonment of deeds and renown
to preserve one’s true nature.

**Explication:**
Here, name is weighed against the body.
*Who?*—that is, which is more intimate?
He elaborates: Between striving for fame and preserving life,
the two are fundamentally opposed—
which aligns more closely with the path of longevity and self-preservation?
He laments that common folk cannot forget fame to preserve their true nature.

**Explication:**
The Sage mourns those who, in their greed for fame,
prioritize renown over life—
name established before them, body endangered behind.
Who can abandon fame to cultivate the Dao,
sever worldly ties to preserve their life?
Thus, Boyi died for righteousness,
Nie Zheng for justice,
Wei Sheng for fidelity,
Bi Gan for wisdom,
Jing Ke for courage,
Long Feng for counsel,
Wu Yuan for loyalty,
Jie Tu for wrath—
all their names renowned, their bodies perished,
their flesh and bones scattered,
their faces flayed, hearts carved out,
burned alive, drowned,
their eyes gouged by swords—
self-inflicted annihilation.
Yet they failed to heed the Confucian teaching:
*"Preserve the whole and return to it."*
Such hollow fame is far from the Dao.

**Between the body and wealth, which is more abundant?**
*Annotation:* Those who pursue profit do so to seek riches,
yet gain wealth only to lose their lives.
Asking which is more abundant, he urges
casting away jade and shattering pearls
to preserve harmony.

**Explication:**
*Abundant* here means *most precious*.
Between body and wealth, which should be valued more?
This is to awaken the realization that the body is the greater treasure,
and wealth should not be prized above it.
The annotation *"casting away jade and shattering pearls"* comes from *Zhuangzi’s* Outer Chapters.

**Explication:**
The Venerable Master observed that the world’s obsession
is with wealth and power—
wealth accumulates, yet the body suffers;
riches multiply, yet misfortune follows.
Who can disperse wealth to avert harm,
take joy in the Dao and embrace poverty?
Thus, Regeng died of riches,
Si Mi of extravagance,
Duke Jian of avarice,
Duke Yi of greed.
As *Zhuangzi’s* *"On Perfect Happiness"* states:
*"What the world honors are wealth, nobility, longevity, and virtue.
What it delights in are flavors, fine garments, music, and beauty.
What it despises are poverty, lowliness, early death, and deformity.
What it endures are hunger, cold, worry, and fear.
Yet the wealthy toil endlessly to amass wealth,
yet cannot spend it all—
their bodies wear thin from labor.
The noble exhaust themselves night and day,
their minds never sated—
their bodies grow frail from overuse.
Yet when they reach opulent mansions and vast estates,
their names are lost, their reputations ruined.
They fail to grasp the truth:
The wise condemn hoarding wealth as a burden,
preserving life and well-being as distant ideals."*

*"Casting away jade and shattering pearls"*—as *Zhuangzi’s* *"On the Thieves"* says:
*"When lips are parched, teeth grow cold.
The Sage is born, yet great thieves arise.
If you abandon the clever and the wise,
spurn thieves and robbers,
the world will begin to order itself.
When rivers dry, valleys empty,
hills level, and springs overflow—
when the Sage dies, great thieves cease to exist.
Abandon the clever, discard wisdom,
and great thieves will desist.
Damage jade, shatter pearls,
and petty thieves will not arise.
For the clever and wise are the tools of thieves,
while jade and pearls kindle greed.
Abandon them, and deceitful thieves will naturally cease."*

**Between gain and loss, which brings greater suffering?**
*Annotation:* Asking whether acquiring fame and wealth
or losing them causes greater bodily harm.

**Explication:**
This summarizes the two prior questions:
Acquiring fame and wealth leads to self-destruction,
preserving life means forsaking fame and wealth.
The distinction is clear—
yet the deluded fail to perceive the harm,
hence the detailed answer that follows.

**Explication:**
The Great Sage expounds the scripture
to rectify and rescue.
He makes clear that the body is precious,
while fame and wealth are trifling.
By posing questions of lightness and heaviness,
he elaborates in his response.
Yet even with earnest guidance,
the bewildered remain obtuse.

Thus, excessive love brings great expenditure,
and excessive hoarding invites heavy loss.
*Annotation:* Those who love fame excessively
exhaust their vital essence—is this not great expenditure?
Those who hoard wealth burden their bodies—is this not heavy loss?

**Explication:**
These two lines answer the prior questions.
*"Excessive love brings great expenditure"* responds to *Who is closer to the body—name or wealth?*
*Expenditure* means *consumption*.
*Closer* means *more beloved*.
Those who love fame excessively
strain their nature and deplete their spirit—
the more they love, the greater the drain.

*"Excessive hoarding invites heavy loss"* responds to *Between the body and wealth, which is more abundant?*
The more wealth is hoarded, the greater its loss.
Swords and jade bring ruin—
like one who hoards treasure, as the saying goes:
*"Poetry and books invite grave-robbing,
only because they contain pearls."*
The harm of wealth is a stern warning.

**Explication:**
Pursuing fame harms oneself,
hoarding wealth destroys the body—
as previously explained.
Master He Shang said:
*"The living hoard in granaries and treasuries,
the dead are buried in mounds and tombs.
The living fear robbery and assault,
the dead fear excavation and desecration.
Swords and jade bring ruin"*—
as in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Huan’s tenth year,
when the younger brother of Duke Mu of Pei, Pei Shu,
possessed a jade, and Duke Mu sought it.
When Pei Shu refused, he later regretted it.

The saying of Zhou states: *"An ordinary man commits no crime, yet he who hoards jade is guilty."* Why should I keep this? It would only bring misfortune through trade. So he offered it instead. Then he sought his precious sword. The younger brother said: *"This man is insatiable. His insatiability will reach me, and I fear he will kill me."* Thus, he attacked Duke Mu of Pei. Hence, Duke Mu fled to Hongchi.

Those who use poetry and ritual to desecrate graves—
In the *Zhuangzi*’s *"Outer Things"* chapter, a scholar used poetry and ritual to desecrate a grave. The great scholar, reciting his tradition, asked: *"The east is brightening—what should we do?"*
The minor scholar replied: *"He has not yet loosened his robes, yet his mouth contains a pearl."*
The ancient poem says:
*"Green-green the barley grows,
planted on the slope—
if not sown to share in life,
why hoard pearls in death?"*
The great scholar said: *"Grasp his hair, press his chin,
slowly strike his jaw with a golden hammer,
so as not to harm the pearl in his mouth."*
The great scholar was a great robber,
the minor scholar a petty robber.
*"The east is brightening"*—meaning the sun is rising.
Poetry refers to ancient verse.
Barley thrives in lowlands, yet here it grows on slopes—
not its proper place.
He who does not practice virtue in life,
yet hoards pearls in death—
this is not proper burial.
Thus, grave-robbing follows.
By nature, this is fitting.
Poetry embodies warmth and kindness,
ritual embodies solemn respect—
the ancient kings’ way to govern the world.
Now, calling scholars thieves for desecrating graves—
is this truly so?
He who knows contentment suffers no disgrace,
he who knows restraint faces no peril—
thus may he endure long.

**Explication:**
The note says: *"Knowing contentment"* means not loving excessively,
*"knowing restraint"* means not hoarding excessively.
Without disgrace or peril,
thus may he endure long and live in health.
*"Disgrace"* means loss and burden.
*"Peril"* means danger and ruin.
Not seeking fame is contentment,
not amassing wealth is restraint.
Knowing contentment, fame matches reality without excess burden;
knowing restraint, wealth is not hoarded without the harm of greed.
Without disgrace or peril,
thus may he endure and live long.

**Explication:**
Man’s birth—
the Dao descends its qi,
the Three Elements radiant with spirit,
bestowed by the Nine Heavens,
endowed with its measure.
Those who cultivate the Dao accumulate merit and prolong life,
those who transgress bear misfortune and die young.
Having coveted fame beyond measure, fame fails to match reality,
and having amassed rare wealth, wealth brings disaster.
At worst, disgrace befalls the body,
at best, peril ends the life.
Disgrace and early death—
self-inflicted ruin, deeply lamentable.
The Venerable Master warned against this,
urging cessation of vain ambition,
abandoning greed for wealth.
Knowing contentment, knowing restraint,
without avarice or desire,
one avoids early death’s calamity,
entering the hall of longevity—
thus may he endure long.

**Chapter 45: Great Achievement as Deficiency**

**Explication:**
The previous chapter clarified which is closer—body or wealth—and how hoarding brings harm.
This chapter explains that great fullness resembles deficiency,
and its application is inexhaustible.
The first seven sentences establish the model for conduct,
the next two contrast stillness and agitation,
and the final section concludes with the principle:
*"Clear and tranquil—this is how one governs the world."*

**Explication:**
The virtuous ruler, the enlightened sage—
their conduct is present yet seems absent,
substantial yet seems empty,
vast as Heaven and Earth in unity,
boundless as yin and yang in harmony.
They do not boast of their accomplishments,
thus appearing as the void of deficiency.
Men see only their outward humility,
unaware of their inner brilliance.
They suppress sharp debate and agitation,
revealing the essence of stillness and wisdom.
They govern the world aright—
nothing surpasses this.
This displays the error of the previous chapter’s fame and wealth,
and foreshadows the fault of the next—greed and desire.
Through clarity and tranquility,
they lay the foundation for Daoist cultivation.
This is their core intent.

*"Great achievement resembles deficiency—*
*its use is inexhaustible."*
**Note:** *"Achievement"* refers to mastery in learning and conduct.
*"Deficiency"* means humility—
thus virtues flourish without depletion.

**Explication:**
All who study—
their virtues complete,
yet they remain self-effacing, like a vessel with a flaw.
Thus their capacities are boundless.
The sage-ruler, too, is thus:
equal to Heaven and Earth in nurturing,
matching the sun and moon in radiance.
Their achievements are vast—
hence *"great achievement."*
Yet they do not rely on their fullness,
remaining as if deficient,
and so their use is endless.

**Explication:**
The sage-ruler governs by the Dao,
harmonizing with its principles.
The superior scholar cultivates himself by the Dao,
merging with its essence.
Thus, as Heaven is high and Earth broad,
the sun shines and the moon watches—
cold and heat, yin and yang,
naturally succeeding one another.
The Dao does not claim their functions.
The sage-ruler follows the Dao in governance,
leading by example, never boasting—
thus he aligns with the Dao.
The scholar’s virtues complete,
his deeds perfect—
he does not vaunt his abilities,
and the Dao shines brighter.
Thus, though they appear deficient,
their essence is whole and full.
For the state, this means eternal sage-rulership;
for the self, boundless harmony.
Though they seem deficient,
there is no time of exhaustion or depletion.

---
*"Great fullness resembles emptiness—*
*its use is inexhaustible."*
**Note:** *"Fullness"* refers to abundant blessings and rank.
*"Emptiness"* means humility—
thus wealth is not squandered, and use is endless.

**Explication:**
*"Emptiness"* is *"void."*
*"Inexhaustible"* means *"without depletion."*
This illustrates the sage’s abundant blessings and rank—
reverent and frugal in self-cultivation,
not indulging in fullness,
thus appearing as the void.
As the saying goes: *"Having yet seems not to have,
substantial yet seems empty."*
Thus their governance is boundless, without depletion.

**Explication:**
Not boasting of what one has,
thus fullness seems emptiness.
Not relying on abundance,
thus use is without scarcity.
The ruler possesses surplus virtue,
the people surplus wealth—
flowing through the Six Peaks,
extending to the Four Extremes.
For the state, this means the people prosper;
for the self, virtue is self-sufficient.
Its use is boundless—
how could there be depletion?

*"Great straightness resembles bending—*
**Note:** *"Straight"* yet not rigid,
thus it seems bent.

「**Commentary:**
*"Straight"* means upright and correct.
*"Bent"* means crooked.
The first four lines together elucidate both form and function,
while the next three lines only present its form,
omitting its function—
abbreviating the text to reveal its meaning,
a pattern that may be understood elsewhere.

To wash oneself yet soil others,
to promote the upright and discard the crooked—
this is *small straightness*.
Not clinging to truth to refute falsehood,
not rectifying oneself to correct others—
this is *great straightness*.
Bending follows the aptness of things,
thus it is called *"as if bent."*

**Commentary:**
*"Straight yet not indulgent"*—
this is the text of the twenty-first chapter of this scroll.

**Explication:**
The Dao harmonizes with *qi* and follows things naturally,
and things themselves generate and flourish.
The ruler governs with the great Dao,
and the people naturally become upright and correct.
The superior scholar embodies the Dao,
wandering with things in accordance with their nature,
and things, sensing its harmony,
each follow their own uprightness.
This straightness is vast and inclusive,
embracing all diversity—
truly great!
This governance flows naturally,
forgetting effort yet achieving results—
truly *"as if bent."*

Those who promote the upright and discard the crooked—
the *Analects* records Duke Ai of Lu asking Confucius:
*"What should one do to make the people submit?"*
Confucius replied:
*"Promote the upright and discard the crooked,
and the people will submit.
If one promotes the crooked and discards the upright,
the people will not submit."*
Duke Ai of Lu was the twelfth ruler of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*’ era,
named Jiang, posthumously called Duke Ai.
At that time, Duke Ai had lost his virtue,
and the people did not submit to him.
Duke Ai was troubled by this,
so he asked Confucius for the method to make the people submit.
*"Upright"* refers to virtuous and honest individuals.
*"Discard"* means to set aside.
*"Crooked"* refers to those who are deceitful and corrupt.
If upright and honest individuals are appointed to office,
while the deceitful and corrupt are removed,
the people will submit to the ruler’s virtue.
If deceitful and flatterers are appointed,
while the upright and honest are discarded,
the people will not submit.
This is Confucius’ criticism of Duke Ai’s practice of abandoning the virtuous and employing the corrupt,
urging him to change his ways.

*"Straight yet not indulgent"*—
this is the text of the twenty-first chapter of this scroll.

**Great skill as if clumsy—**
**Commentary:**
*"Skill"* does not overreach beyond its proper bounds,
thus it seems clumsy.

**Commentary:**
To boast of the artistry of painting,
or to show off the mastery of hook and line—
this is *small skill*.
To utilize materials according to their nature,
to achieve success by letting things fulfill their purpose,
without losing their aptness—
this is *great skill*.
Without artificial adornment,
its function is unseen,
appearing as if crude and clumsy.
Zhuangzi says of the Transformative Power:
*"It shapes all things yet does not claim credit for its art."*

**Explication:**
The great transformation of Heaven and Earth,
the grand balance of Yin and Yang,
blow forth myriad forms—
no trace of their work is seen.
The ruler sits upright and impartial,
teaching all under Heaven,
each fulfilling their abilities,
all things applying their functions—
round and square, crooked and straight,
all finding their proper use,
noble and base, wise and foolish,
all displaying their talents.
This is *great skill*!
Heaven and Earth create yet do not dominate,
Yin and Yang nourish yet do not possess,
The ruler transforms yet does not rely—
thus it seems *clumsy*.

The artistry of painting—
the *Analects* records:
*"In painting, the colors are applied after the white ground is set."*
This means that after the five colors are arranged,
the white ground is used to separate and define them,
thus completing the design.
The white ground is the powder.
This is called *powder painting*.

The mastery of hook and line—
the *Zhuangzi* records in *"The Horse’s Hoof"*:
*"The potter said: ‘I am skilled in shaping clay,
so that round forms fit the compass,
and square forms fit the square.’
The carpenter said: ‘I am skilled in working wood,
so that curves follow the hook,
and straight lines follow the line.’
Yet the nature of clay and wood—
do they truly desire to fit compass, square, hook, or line?
Yet still, age after age, people praise them.
This illustrates the nature of earth—
when planted, it yields the Five Grains;
when dug, it produces sweet springs.
This illustrates the nature of wood—
when crooked, it becomes a wheel;
when straight, it becomes a beam.
Now, the potter uses the compass and square,
the carpenter uses the hook and line—
round forms are made square by the square,
square forms are made round by the compass,
crooked lines are made straight by the line,
straight lines are made crooked by the hook.
This is the extreme loss of their true nature—
truly *small skill*!

The Transformative Power shaping myriad forms—
the *Zhuangzi* records in *"The Great Upholder"*:
*"Yi Zhi asked Xu You: ‘I wish to wander in the domain of the supreme Dao.’
Xu You replied: ‘Ah! My teacher is there—
He arranges all things yet does not claim righteousness,
His blessings extend to all ages yet He does not claim benevolence,
He surpasses the ancient sages yet is not called venerable.
He covers and loads Heaven and Earth,
shapes all forms yet does not claim skill.’
This is the Dao he wandered in."*」

「This is what is called the Dao of my Teacher—**Naturalness**—without contrivance, spontaneous.

The *Zhuangzi* learned from Him,
and the Dao of His wandering—
**Naturalness**, and nothing more.

**Eloquent speech is like silence**—
*Annotation*: It does not adorn with empty words, hence like silence.
*Commentary*: Combining parables and embellishing speech, weaving intricate arguments—this is **small eloquence**.
Teaching without words, **eloquent in shaping myriad things**,
exhausting principles and fathoming true nature—**this is great eloquence**.
**The supreme utterance transcends speech**,
neither suppressing nor elevating,
like a **profound and silent** state.

*Explanation*: **"Combining parables"** means drawing analogies to fit one’s intent,
**embellishing speech** with ornate phrases—
this is not **true principle**.
**Weaving intricate arguments** and **selecting elaborate words**—
this is not **supreme utterance**.
To **listen and respond** is to engage in **small eloquence**.

The **intent of the Sage**,
the **conduct of the superior scholar**,
transcends the realm of **named speech**,
crosses the threshold of **language and silence**,
yet **all things are naturally distinguished** without description,
and **weighty mysteries are deeply understood** without allegory.

This is the **greatest eloquence**.
Without speech or explanation,
**silent recognition** of **effortless action**—
this is like **profound silence**.

The Sage **dwells in stillness** to **nurture and subdue**,
the superior scholar **concentrates in quietude** to **grasp the Mysterious**,
**True Transformation flows naturally**,
unknown yet its power is complete—
thus one may attain **serene tranquility**.

**Excessive motion overcomes coldness**,
**stillness overcomes heat**.

*Commentary*: This is used to illustrate **teaching**.

**The one who clings to completion will fail**,
**the one who holds to fullness will topple**—
thus the Sage **fulfills the world’s needs** yet **does not see success**,
like the **unfilled**—
this is why there is **no flaw**.

**Though in the highest rank**,
He **does not regard His station**,
like the **void**—
this is why there is **no exhaustion**.

Fearful that others may not understand,
He **borrows the imagery of dynamic and static *yang qi*** to illustrate it.

**Excessive motion** (*yang qi*) **stirs in spring and summer**,
**reaching its peak** on the earth’s surface—
all things **generate** from this **excessive motion**.
When **motion reaches its extreme**, coldness arises,
coldness brings **decay and death** to all things.
Thus it is clear that **excessive motion is the root of death**,
and **fullness is the source of decay**.

This illustrates that **those who achieve completion or fullness yet cannot yield or remain void will meet ruin**.
**Excessive motion overcomes coldness**—
meaning in **autumn and winter**, *yang qi* **retires beneath the Yellow Springs**,
**stillness reaching its extreme** generates heat,
heat brings **harmonious *he qi*** to emerge—
all things **generate** from this,
**life depending on stillness** to arise.
Thus **stillness is the root of life**,
yet also **the sovereign over excessive motion**.

This is the metaphor for **great completion and great fullness**,
yet the ability to **yield and remain void**—
this is why there is **no flaw or exhaustion**,
and **naturalness is perfected**.

**Those who can remain in effortless stillness**,
attain the **source of life**.
This exhorts people to **pursue stillness** for **true nourishment**,
not to **lightly embrace excessive motion** and **rush toward death**.

*Explanation*: The **master of supreme principle**,
the **scholar of Dao cultivation**,
**abandons vice and refines breath**,
**empties the heart and conserves spirit**—
just as **excessive motion can overcome coldness**,
and **stillness can overcome heat**.

**Excessive motion** corresponds to **spring and summer**,
reaching its extreme brings **decay and death** to all things.
**Stillness** corresponds to **autumn and winter**,
reaching its extreme brings **flourishing and generation**.

The *Classic of Rites* states:
**Spring**—**stirring**—
all things **stir and grow**.
**Summer**—**peak**—
all things **receive *yang qi* and flourish**.

When **midwinter arrives**, one *yang* **gradually sprouts**—
**motion stirs and life begins**, hence called **excessive motion**.
When **excessive motion reaches its extreme**, decay and death follow.

**Autumn**—**grief**—
things are **about to decay**, hence called **grief**.
**Winter**—**concealment**—
things **close and hide**, *yang qi* **latent and dormant**,
**not yet stirring**.
**Not yet stirring** is called **stillness**—
when **stillness reaches its extreme**, warmth and **generation** arise.

Thus **stillness is the root of life**,
and **excessive motion is the root of death**—
as the *Yinfu* says:
**“Life is the root of death, death is the root of life.”**

This is the **meaning of *yin-yang* overcoming each other**,
the **mechanism of beginning and end**.

The *Scripture of the Celestial Element* says:
After **Establishing Summer** (*Lìxià*),
the sun **travels northward** across the earth,
**entering less**—
thus nights are short and days long,
**generating heat**.
After **Establishing Autumn** (*Lìqiū*),
the sun **travels southward** across the earth,
**entering more**—
thus nights are long and days short,
**generating coolness**.
The sun’s **distance from the extremes** varies,
near or far—
thus there are **warmth, coolness, coldness, and heat** in difference.

**If the ruler follows the Dao**,
**effortless governance** prevails—
**policy is still**, yet **all things thrive**,
the **state is secure**, yet **people prosper**,
**kings from all directions come to pay homage**,
**five armies are not raised**,
**serene and empty**, yet **harmonious and tranquil**,
**clear and silent**, yet **gentle and at peace**—
**crafty deceivers dare not intrude**,
**the strong dare not act violently**,
**beacons and alarms are not lit**,
**drums and gongs are not sounded**—
within the **four seas**, all dwell in **tranquility**.

This is **stillness overcoming**—**victory**.

When **transformation reaches its peak**,
then **singing and dancing flourish**,
**respect and yielding arise**,
**nine clans are harmonious**,
**four gates are orderly**,
**rites and music are established**,
**virtuous and capable ones are employed**—
**carriages and boats** come in **expectation of welcome**,
**writings and laws** follow **proper order** in **receiving transformation**,
**eight regions gather**,
**all directions rush forward**,
**Heaven and Earth respond in harmony**,
**humanity and spirits communicate freely**—
**joyous and radiant**, all **transform within the Dao**,
**cutting off the evil of peering and scheming**,
**no neighbor lurks for advantage**—
they **sing and recite**, **dance and tread**.

This is the **result of stillness and effortless principle**.

**If the ruler acts with excessive motion**,
**ministers resort to deceit and flattery**,
**agitating arms and displaying force**,
**a million-strong army ascends** to the **Single Sovereign’s platform**,
**banners and flags stretch a thousand *li***,
**crossing vast and distant shores**—
**the aged and weak are burdened with labor**,
**women and children aid in transport**,
**the four seas boil in unrest**,
**the six directions are disturbed**.

When **people’s exhaustion reaches its limit**,
**families are depleted**,
**lives are lost**,
**wilds are abandoned**, no **human trace remains**,
**daytime echoes with ghostly lamentations**.

This is the **fate of excessive motion overcoming**.

**Before, with stillness and effortless principle**,
**warmth and harmony** prevailed among people.
**Now, with excessive motion and force**,
**silence and coldness** follow—
**can one not be warned?**

**Serene stillness is the rectification for the world**.
*Annotation*: When **excessive motion overcomes**, it leads to **coldness**—
coldness, **thinness**.
When **stillness overcomes**, it leads to **heat**—
heat, **harmony**.
Thus **the bent is the greatest straightness**,
**the pure and empty is the true rectification**.

*Commentary*: This **concludes the previous meaning**.

The **Sage** observes the **advance and retreat of the Yang qi**,
knowing that **excessive motion** is the **root of premature death**,
and **stillness** is the **foundation of vitality**.

In governing **human affairs** and **nurturing all living beings**,
**holding to the root** to **unify the branches**,
and **pursuing the Dao of serene stillness**,
then one may **rectify the world** indeed.

**The Meaning states**:
The **Sage** knows that **the unrestrained course** (冲缺)
can **preserve fullness**,
and **the method of serene stillness** (澄静)
can **restrain movement**.

When **movement is perfected**, **serene stillness** naturally **manifests**;
when **excessive motion is suppressed**, **gentle harmony** naturally **shines forth**—
thus one may **lead the world to non-action** (無為),
and **return all directions to rectitude** (貞正),
following the **cyclical interplay of Yin and Yang, cold and heat**,
and **discerning the sources of life and death, gain and loss**—
this is now **clearly illuminated**.

**The *Daode Jing* – *Guangsheng Yi* (廣聖義) Scroll Thirty-Four** concludes.

#1 *兼受选士*: According to *Han Records* (漢志), **"受"** should be read as **"爱"**.
#2 *生於陂*: According to the following text and *Zhuangzi* (莊子), it should be read as **"生於陵陂"**.

**Chapter on the Dao of the World** (天下有道) **Forty-Sixth**
*Explanation*: The previous chapter elucidates the operation of the **Five Great Elements** (五大), opening the path to broad cultivation. This chapter reveals the **Three Great Faults** (三大之愆), to expose the harms of what is sought after.

First, it marks the **losses and gains** (损益) of **having the Dao** (有道) and **lacking the Dao** (無道); next, it clarifies the **origins of crime and blame** (为罪为咎); finally, it concludes with **knowing contentment as virtue** (知足之为德), warning against **greed as calamity** (贪求之为患).

**Meaning**:
The world (天) is the **domain of the Sage** (圣人之御宇).
With **axe and banner** (斧扆) held before him, he faces south,
**diviners and seers** (巫史) at his fore and rear,
**soothsayers and musicians** (卜筮瞽侑) arrayed on either side—
**non-action** (無為) while **upholding absolute rectitude** (守至正).

The **Three Ministers** (三公) preside in court,
the **Three Elders** (三老) instruct in learning,
the **hundred officials** (百辟) fulfill their duties,
**cultivating virtue and culture** (修文德) to **win over the distant** (怀远),
**propagating the Dao’s transformation** (敷道化) to **nurture the people** (育人).
Thus, customs become **smooth and harmonious** (洽和平),
families flourish with **ritual and yielding** (礼让),
**tribute and offerings** (琛赆) come from the **four barriers** (四塞),
**military expeditions cease** (息征戌) at the **three borders** (三边),
**weapons are inverted** (倒载干戈),
**oxen rest and horses return** (休牛归马),
and then the people **take joy in tilling and hoeing** (乐耕耨),
**manuring the fields** (粪田畴),
**plentiful crops rise like clouds** (多稼如云),
with **surplus grain stored in granaries** (余粮栖亩).

If any **deviate from this**, then **grievances and foes multiply** (怨敌交侵),
**warhorses gallop ceaselessly** (戎马载驰),
**armor and arms are used again** (甲兵复用).
Why does this happen?
Because the **rulers above harbor the vice of covetous desires** (上有贪得可欲之非),
indulging in **unrestrained expansion of lands** (恣拓土无厌之祸).
**Exhausting armies and waging wars** (穷兵演武) will **inevitably lead to self-destruction** (必致自焚).
**Laozi warns through the text of knowing contentment** (老君戒以知足之文),
to **settle them in their proper measure** (欲使安其分).
Once **measure is always content** (分既常足),
then **one may speak of the Dao and its principles** (可以言於理道).

When the world **has the Dao** (天下有道),
**warhorses are turned away to manure fields** (却走马以粪).
*Annotation*: The ruler of a world **with the Dao** (天下有道之主)
**allows the Dao’s transformation to flourish** (無為化行),
**not coveting**, thus **no wars occur** (固无交战),
**repelling the use of warhorses** (屏却走马之事).
People **gain from manure to clear their fields** (人得粪除田园).
*Explanation*: **Repel** (却) means **to block and repel** (屏却).
**Manure** (粪) refers to **cultivating the fields** (理田).
The world **with the Dao** (天下有道) means
**governing by the Dao** (以道为理),
**allowing the transformation of non-action to prevail** (無為化行),
**keeping the borders at peace** (守在四夷),
with **no military conflicts** (疆场无事),
**not seizing more lands to burden the people** (不得多贪土地以困黎元),
thus **blocking the use of war chariots and warhorses** (所以屏却兵车走马之事).
People **begin to till the southern fields** (得俶载南亩),
**manuring and clearing their gardens** (以粪理田园).

**Meaning**:
The ancients said:
*The ruler is like a boat (舟), the people like water (水).*
People **cannot be governed without a ruler** (非君不理),
a boat **cannot move without water** (非水不行).
Boat and water **depend on each other** (相须),
**never to be momentarily parted** (不可暂失).
Thus, the **foundation of governing the realm** (理国之本)
is **to nourish the people** (养人为先).
The **ruler with the Dao** (有道之君)
**maintains peace at the borders** (守在四夷),
**no external wars or raids** (外无兵寇),
**no weapons are employed** (戈楯不用),
**no blades are sharpened** (锋镝不施),
**armor and horses are repelled** (却甲马於三边),
**fields are plowed in the four wilds** (辟田畴於四野).
**Deep plowing and sparse sowing** (深耕浅种),
**abundance for families and prosperity for the state** (家给国肥),
**food as the shared duty of heaven and earth** (食为人天),
**the greatest concern of the realm** (邦之大务).

The phrase **"begin to till the southern fields"** (俶载南亩)
comes from the **Book of Songs** (《诗□小雅□甫田篇》).
**Begin** (俶) means **commence** (始),
**till** (载) means **undertake** (事).
When **spring planting is already begun** (春作既兴),
they **commence tilling the southern fields** (始事南亩).
The **southern fields** (南亩) are the name of a field.
The **Book of Songs** says: *"plow to the east of the field"* (南东其亩).
A **field** (亩) is **one hundred paces** (百步).
Wide **six feet**, long **six hundred feet** (广六尺, 长六百尺),
**able to sustain life** (可以母养於物),
thus it is called a **field** (亩).

**Cultivators of the Dao** (修道之士),
**take intention as their horse** (以意为马),
**take emotion as their field** (以情为田).
If they **repel the galloping of the horse of intention** (却意马之奔驰),
**the spirit will become tranquil** (神将静矣);
If they **allow the field of emotion to rest** (使情田之逸暇),
**the mind will become at ease** (心将泰矣).
Then **the Dao may be cultivated** (而后道可修).

The **Book of Rites** says:
*The human is the **virtue of heaven and earth** (天地之德),
the **interplay of Yin and Yang** (阴阳之交),
the **convergence of spirits and gods** (鬼神之会),
the **refinement of the Five Phases** (五行之秀).*
Thus, when the **Sage sets the standard** (圣人作则),
he **must take heaven and earth as the foundation** (以天地为本),
**Yin and Yang as the pivot** (阴阳为端),
**the four seasons as the handle** (四时为柄),
**the sun and stars as the markers** (日星为纪),
**spirits and gods as his attendants** (鬼神以为徒),
**the Five Phases as his substance** (五行以为质),
**ritual and righteousness as his vessels** (礼义以为器),
**human emotions as his field** (人情以为田),
**the four spiritual creatures as his livestock** (四灵以为畜).

Thus, **human emotions are the field of the Sage King** (圣王之田).
The **field of emotion, left to non-action** (情田无为),
**nears the Dao** (几於道矣).
The **world** (天下) is the **collective term for governing the realm** (统言理国).

When the world **lacks the Dao** (天下无道),
**warhorses breed in the suburbs** (戎马生於郊).
*Annotation*: The ruler of a world **lacking the Dao** (天下无道之君)
**indulges in desires and conquests** (纵欲攻取),
thus **soldiers and warhorses thrive at the borders** (兵士戎马寄生於郊境).
*Explanation*: **Suburbs** (郊) mean **borderlands** (交),
the **crossroads where two states meet** (二国郊境之际),
the **places of defense** (拒守之地).
The ruler of a world **lacking the Dao** (天下无道之君)
**leaves wastelands ungoverned** (荒塞有不宾之虏).
Thus, **soldiers and warhorses breed in the borderlands** (兵戎军马生育於郊境),
**remaining there for long** (谓久而不还).

**Meaning**:
If one **governs the realm without the Dao** (理国不以道),
then **borderlands are expanded** (开拓边土),
**raids are launched against the barbarians** (侵伐戎夷),
**territories are not at peace** (封域不宁),
**military campaigns never cease** (征役无已).
Some **covet fine foods and provoke the wars of Fan-Yu** (贪蒟酱起番禺之役),
others **love fine horses and raise the army of Da-Yuan** (好名马起大宛之师),
**bones are abandoned in desolate wastes** (骨委穷荒),
**blood stains the wild grasses** (血涂草莽),
**soldiers’ spirits wander in foreign lands** (营魄流飘於异域),
**war chariots stagnate in distant suburbs** (戎车沦滞於远郊),
**years stretch endlessly with prolonged campaigns** (绵岁月以长征),
**until harvest time comes and they do not return** (及瓜时而不返),
**supply lines never rest** (转输莫息),
**the looms and spinning wheels stand idle** (杼轴其空),
**the people grieve and the state collapses** (人怨国亡).
This calamity is **not decreed by heaven** (非天与),
**worthy of deep reflection** (所宜深戒).

How much better it is
when **the world is undisturbed** (宇内不扰),
**all feudal lords come as guests** (诸侯咸宾),
**ruler and people live in harmony** (君民协和),
**superior and inferior mutually protect** (上下相保).
Thus, **valiant warriors have no place to expend their strength** (壮士无所施其力),
**eloquent scholars have no chance to display their words** (辩士无所衒其词),
**martial men have no need to sharpen their blades** (武士无所锐其锋),
**wise strategists have no opportunity to implement their plans** (智士无所申其策).
**Molds and spears are cast into plows and hoes** (铸剑戟以为犁锄),
**treasures and jade knives are exchanged for oxen and calves** (货佩刀而市耕犊).
**Non-action and no labor** (无为无役),
**to preserve the enduring vision** (以全永图).

**No greater crime exists than covetous desire** (罪莫大於可欲).
*Annotation*: **Desire** (可欲) is a **great crime** (罪大).
*Explanation*: **Crime** (罪) means **transgressing laws** (犯法),
**covetous desire** (贪求) means **lust** (欲).
The **crime of warhorses breeding in the suburbs** (戎马生郊之罪)
**arises from the ruler’s noble pursuit of lands** (由人君贵求土地),
**seeing lands as desirable** (见土地可欲),
**desire stirring and noble pursuit about to begin** (欲心兴动将起贵求).
Thus, **no greater crime exists than covetous desire** (罪莫大於可欲).

**Meaning**:
**Law** (法) is what **restrains the people and suppresses chaos** (所以禁民戢乱),
**punishes evil and binds transgressors** (惩恶绳违).
If one **boldly violates it** (干而犯之),
then it is **crime** (罪).
The character **罪** (crime) has **罔** (net) beneath **非** (wrong),
indicating **nets to ensnare the unlawful** (网罗以制其非法).
The **greatest crime** (罪之大者)
is **no greater desire than that which arises from the heart and leads to greed** (欲莫大乎因心起贪),
which is called **lust** (谓之欲).

The **arising of covetous desire in those of noble rank**
leads to **carved walls and towering halls**,
**squandering wealth and boasting of arms**.
The **excess of external allure and internal lust** plunges one into **madness from which there is no return**;
**campaigns to the Yanshan and Longdu passes** exhaust the people **without respite**.
Until **the realm’s hearts turn asunder**,
**ships become enemy strongholds**,
then **ruin follows**.
What greater delusion is there?

The **arising of covetous desire within oneself**
drives one to **pursue profit and chase renown**,
**indulge in sounds and linger over colors**,
**delight in embroidered finery and ornate splendor**,
**blinding the eyes so they cannot turn away**;
**to yield to the pleasures of light fare, music, and wine**,
**until death without awakening**.
Until **the sinews and bones grow weary and wasted**,
**ears grow deaf and eyes blind**,
then **the self is lost**.
How great is this folly?

Thus, in the **Spring and Autumn Annals, Duke Li of the 20th year**,
when **Song Xiang Gong sought to unite the feudal lords**,
**Zang Wen Zhong, a minister of Lu, said**:
*"If one follows others’ desires, it may succeed,
but if one makes others follow one’s own desires, few will be saved."*
This means **bending one’s own desires to align with the virtues of many**.
The following year, **Song Gong formed the Alliance of Lu Mountain**.
**Song Gong’s son, Mu Yi, remarked**:
*"Small states vie for alliances—
fortune may bring ruin."*
That autumn, **the Chu army captured Song Gong and ravaged Song**.
This illustrates **how following desire defies the Dao**.

**Laozi’s teachings and admonitions** reveal the **root of this crime**,
urging the **excision of covetous desire**—
**only then may one enjoy boundless blessings**,
**govern the realm as the Sage-King**,
**and cultivate the self toward immortality**.
**Diligently practicing the Dao’s essence is the key**.

**No greater calamity exists than insatiability**.
*(Note: Unceasing pursuit brings great ruin.)*
*(Commentary: Calamity is harm; the divine does not aid it.)*
**How does great ruin arise?**
From **greed for land**, **pursuit without satisfaction**,
**ignoring the limit of sufficiency**,
**invoking divine wrath and inviting disaster**.
Human errors are manifold,
but **greed’s ruin is the greatest**.

**Crime and calamity both originate in the self**.
**The self’s generation of evil stems from the mind’s thoughts**.
Thus, **body, speech, and mind are the three actions**.
Within these three actions, **ten evils arise**.
Among these ten evils, **greed’s guilt deepens**.
Thus, **life-and-death strife and contention all stem from greed**.
Greed is **one of the mind’s actions**.
If a ruler is greedy, **externally he ravages the borders**,
**internally he burdens the people**.
If he **unceasingly seeks above**, then **below, supply falters and governance weakens**,
**the people resent and the divine grows angry**—
thus **the state’s ruin begins**.
If one is greedy in **cultivating the self**, then **lusts know no satisfaction**,
**the spirit wanders and the vital essence dissipates**,
**virtue’s blessings withhold aid**, and **life is cut short**.
Yet if one **internally restrains the source of greed**,
**externally halts its pursuit**,
then **no enmity arises**, the **self is secure**, and the **state prospers**—
**this is the ever-sufficient sufficiency**.

**No greater fault exists than desiring what one desires**.
*(Note: The greatest misfortune is demanding that all desires be fulfilled.)*
*(Commentary: Fault is misfortune. The greedy tyrant’s desires grow ever more extravagant;*
**if obtained unjustly, ruin follows swiftly**—
**self-inflicted misfortune is inevitable.)*

**Covetous desire** refers to **desire not yet attained**—
**when greed first stirs, guilt is lighter than calamity**.
But **the insatiable**, once obtained, **invite calamity graver than guilt**—
**none surpass the fault of desiring what is already desired**,
for **when desire is fulfilled yet still unquenched**, then **fault exceeds calamity**.

**To take and still seek more**,
**to pursue without end**—
**the people respond with anger**, and **war and bandits arise**.
**Misfortune and fault become great crimes**,
for **when one violates prohibitions**,
**the first transgression is called guilt**.
As **Laozi’s *Scripture of Regret* states**:
*"The first offense is guilt, also called error."*
**Error means mistake**; **eighteen hundred offenses become calamity**—
**calamity is graver than guilt**.
**Twelve hundred sixty offenses become fault**—
**fault is graver still than calamity**.

**No desire surpasses lust**—
**for love is heavy and desirable**.
**No calamity surpasses wealth**—
**for greed knows no sufficiency**.
**No fault is greater than fame**—
**for it demands the fulfillment of desire**.
Human errors and crimes are countless,
but **wealth, lust, and fame** are the three greatest.
**Ruining households, losing lives, toppling states, and destroying selves**—
all stem from these.
**This is a clear warning**.

**True sufficiency is ever-sufficient**.
*(Note: Material abundance is not sufficiency;*
**sufficiency lies in the heart’s contentment**—
**if the heart knows sufficiency, then sufficiency is eternal.)*
*(Commentary: This concludes the chapter on the virtuous ruler.)*
**The virtuous ruler’s desires are vast yet restrained**,
**not greedy for land**, and thus **within his proper bounds he knows sufficiency**,
**winning the people’s joyful allegiance**,
**securing the self and ordering the state**.
This **sufficiency of sufficiency** extends to **reciprocal yielding and eternal contentment**.
*(Note: Material abundance is not sufficiency;*
**sufficiency is in the heart, not in things**—
**to follow the shore and guard one’s measure**,
**though little, is much**;
**though many desires go unfulfilled, even abundance is insufficient**.)

**Greed and sufficiency both emerge from the heart**—
**if the heart is sufficient, then things are ever abundant**;
**if the heart is greedy, then things are ever lacking**.
The greedy, though **possessing the four seas and ten thousand chariots**, still **seek beyond**;
the sufficient, though **with but a bowl of rice and a single room**, **forget not their joy**.
**Appropriate measure and sufficiency lie in the heart**—
**this is what must be exhorted**.

**Chapter 47: The Teaching That Does Not Leave the Door**
*(Commentary: The previous chapter illuminated*
**the Way of the world and eternal sufficiency**;
**this chapter expounds the teaching that requires no exit**,
**demonstrating how the unacted achieves completion**.)*

**If one does not leave, then one may know**—
**if people are harmonious, then Heaven is in accord**—
**the more one exits, the greater the loss**—
**thus, through non-action, transformation is complete.**

「○ This is the principle: The Sage’s perception is boundless,
yet he does not step beyond his door or courtyard;
the superior scholar stills his heart,
**harmonizing in secret with Heaven and Earth**—
**harmonizing in secret, he perceives no distance unobserved**,
**his gaze fixed, yet the farther he sees, the clearer it becomes**,
**he acts not yet knows**—
this is what is meant.

**Not leaving the door, yet knowing all under Heaven.**
*(Commentary: The Sage-King with the Dao,*
**who governs through non-action**,
**does not issue decrees beyond his door**—
**pure virtue spreads naturally across the world**—
this is truly knowing the Way to govern all under Heaven.)

Another interpretation says:
If the ruler teaches well,
then all under Heaven responds with goodness,
and he need not trouble himself to leave his door to know them.
Thus, the *Yijing* says:
*"The gentleman speaks his words,
and if they are good, they resonate even beyond a thousand li;
how much more so for those nearby?"*
This is what is meant.

This principle says:
The Sage’s governance
**is to observe himself by himself**—
**if his own body is upright, then all under Heaven is upright**,
**if his own governance is correct, then all under Heaven is governed correctly**.
Thus it is said:
*"To be reverent within oneself and face south is all that is required."*

What need is there for further action?
Since he has already **cleared the chaos of the Supreme Origin**,
**giving birth to all things**,
**each kind finds its proper place**—
**fish sink, birds soar, distinctions of high and low are fixed,
Heaven and Earth are set in their courses**.
Though the **six directions** are vast,
and the **nine regions** are broad,
they are but like the four limbs and hundred bodies.
**One can discern them by the heart alone**—
why must he move his feet to know them?
**To know without leaving the door is indeed true.**

The gentleman’s words, if good,
**are the words of the *Yijing*’s "Upper System" (上系).**
It is said:
**His words and deeds issue from himself and benefit the people**—
**actions begin nearby yet are seen afar**,
**words and deeds are the pivot and mechanism of the gentleman**.
When the pivot and mechanism are set in motion,
**they determine honor and disgrace**.
If even the distant respond thus,
how much more so the near?
**Without peering through the window, one sees the Dao of Heaven.**

*(Annotation: **Through reverent stillness and non-action**,
he does not issue decrees beyond his door—
this is truly knowing the Way to govern all under Heaven.
When human affairs are harmonious,
then the patterns of Heaven align accordingly,
so he need not strain to peer through the window
to perceive the Dao of Heaven.)*

*(Commentary: The correspondence between humanity and Heaven,
**the interflow of refined essence and vital qi**—
if the ruler governs with **virtue/power (德)**,
then the **symbols and patterns (象纬)** follow without confusion;
**if he dishonors the Five Phases (五行)**,
then **yīn and yáng** will err accordingly.
Thus the *Shūjīng* says:
*"When auspicious omens appear, the timely rains fall in reverence;
when inauspicious omens appear, the constant winds blow in darkness."*
This means the ruler’s actions—whether reverent or dark—
**already manifest in Heaven’s symbols and patterns**,
**why wait to peer through the window before they can be seen?**

The *Yijing* says:
*"Words and deeds—
this is how the gentleman moves Heaven and Earth."*
This principle says:
The governance of **emperors and kings**
**follows Heaven’s canopy and Earth’s load**—
**they mark the passage of sun and moon**,
**reverently instructing the people in the seasons**,
**using the jade pivot and jade balance**
to align the **seven luminaries (七政)**,
**thus harmonizing with Heaven’s Way**.
Heaven **hangs forth its symbols (垂象)**,
and the Sage **follows them**—
this is how he **models Heaven’s actions**.
Having already **harmonized and followed Heaven’s symbols**,
if he corrects himself and acts accordingly,
then the ruler’s every deed
**will resonate with Heaven’s Dao**—
**auspiciousness and inauspiciousness rest with him alone**,
**order and chaos lie within his heart**.
Why must he **toil ceaselessly (乾乾)**,
**ever vigilant at dusk (夕惕)**?
**Symbols and patterns (象纬)**—
**those that record texts are called symbols (象)**,
**those that divinate and measure are called patterns (纬)**.
**From the Great Insult (大慢法), it is called dishonoring (威侮)**;
**if they shift and disorder, it is called erring (舛侯)**.
This is caused by the ruler’s actions.

*"Rains fall in reverence" and "winds blow in darkness"*
**are found in the *Shāngshū*’s "Transmission of the Hong Fan" (洪范传)**,
which says:
*"When auspicious omens appear, the timely rains fall in reverence."*
**Auspicious (休) means good (善).**
It says that when the ruler acts with reverence,
the timely rains follow in order.
**Reverent (肃) means respectful (敬).**
*"When inauspicious omens appear, the constant winds blow in darkness."*
**Inauspicious (咎) means inauspicious (凶)**,
**darkness (蒙) means obscured (暗)**,
**constant (恒) means enduring (常)**,
**order (若) means follow (顺).**
It says that when the ruler’s actions are dark,
the constant winds follow in darkness.

*"Words and deeds move Heaven and Earth"*
**is found in the *Yijing*’s "Upper System" (上系),**
which says:
*"Words and deeds—
this is how the gentleman moves Heaven and Earth;
can one not be cautious?"*
This means:
**Though the gentleman’s words and deeds appear varied in form**,
**if his Dao is the same, then the response will be the same**.
The farther his words reach,
the less they are truly known.

*(Annotation: If one cannot govern through non-action,
and must instead issue decrees that spread far,
then his understanding of the Way to govern all under Heaven will be all the more limited.)*

*(Commentary: This elucidates the ruler who has lost the Dao.
Unable to still himself in non-action and be reverent within,
he would issue decrees to transform the people—
the farther his decrees spread,
the more he loses the Way of non-action,
and the fewer his methods of governance become.)*

This principle says:
**If his own body is upright, his decrees need not be issued yet they are followed**,
**if his own body is not upright, though he issues decrees, they are not obeyed**.
The ruler cannot **reverently still himself**,
**merge his heart with the Dao**,
**and govern all under Heaven through non-action**—
even if he widely issues threats and commands,
the people will not follow them.
**How much more so if he entrusts worthy ministers without doubt**,
**follows goodness without weariness**,
**is reverent within himself and extends sincerity to the people below**,
**transforming without words, guiding without decrees?**

Thus, the Sage **knows without action**,
*(Annotation: **Not leaving the door**, hence it is said **without action**.)*
**through pure and simple non-action**,
**yet knows the Way of governance**.
*(Commentary: This is the full explanation of **knowing all under Heaven without leaving the door**.)
**When there is no action, no governance is needed**—
why must he issue words and decrees beyond his door
**before calling it knowing?**

This principle says:
The Sage who governs the state
**leads by his own person, following the Dao**—
**the Dao merges with Heaven**,
**he harmonizes in secret with the Supreme Mystery (上玄)**,
**and all directions submit to him**,
**responding like echoes to calls**—
**he need not act or transform before they can be known**.

***"Nearly taking from oneself"***
**is found in the *Yijing*’s "Lower System" (下系),**
which says:
*"In ancient times, when Pòuxī (庖羲) ruled all under Heaven,
he looked upward to observe Heaven’s symbols (观象於天),
and looked downward to observe Earth’s patterns (观法於地).
He observed the markings of birds and beasts,
and the suitability of the land below—
**nearly taking from oneself, distantly taking from things**.
He first made the **Eight Trigrams (八卦)**,
to **communicate the virtue/power (神明之德) of the luminaries**,
and to **categorize the emotions (情) of all things**.
This means his **ears, eyes, nose, and mouth**
**correspond with the Eight Trigrams**—
**his actions, if auspicious, are answered accordingly**,
**if inauspicious, are opposed accordingly**.
**Misfortune and fortune have no fixed gate**—
they are summoned solely by the person.***

«When I take no action yet people transform themselves,
this is the language of the *Fifty-Seventh Chapter* of the *Classic*.

**Not seeing yet naming.***
*Note: He does not peer through windows, hence it is said "not seeing."*
When a person is in harmony with Heaven, he can name its **Great Peace (太平)**.
*Commentary: This explains the phrase "not peering through windows" by revealing the Dao of Heaven.*

When a crane calls, its offspring responds in tune;
when one acts with sincerity, Heaven moves accordingly.
From the small one can discern the great,
by examining oneself one can understand things.

**Fortune and misfortune are summoned by the person**—
then the transformation of **Great Peace** can be achieved and spoken of.
Why must one peer and see before naming it?
Thus it is said: **Not seeing yet naming.**

*The meaning is this:*
The **Dao of Heaven (天道)** is vast and open,
not distant from the self.
Heaven and humanity resonate together,
with no separation between their influences.
**Misfortune and fortune align in accordance**—
this is determined by one’s actions.
If the self is already in order,
then it is naturally fitting.

Heaven responds to human harmony,
**without needing to peer through windows.**
When a crane calls from the secluded dark,
its offspring still harmonizes.
When a person deceives in private,
things will surely know it.

**Worry, regret, and stinginess**
reside in the minutiae,
**determining gain and loss**
lies within the pivotal mechanisms.

The **gentleman contemplates before speaking,
considers before acting**—
this is the principle of **caution in the subtle (慎微之理)**.
Though subtle, it must be answered;
how distant can it be?

**Not seeing yet naming**—
since the **Dao is already mysterious and unified**,
and the heart aligns with the Dao,
all things correspond and resonate accordingly.
Thus, one does not need to see before naming it.

**Achieving without action.**
*Note: He does not speak of governance,
yet the world transforms itself accordingly.*
*Commentary: This summarizes the meaning of "not peering nor acting."*

If the **above (the ruler) has actions to perform**,
the **below (the people) will have grievances**.
Now, the **Sage concentrates his spirit and remains solemn at the throne (凝神端扆)**,
**mysteriously silent in the hall of audience (玄默朝堂)**,
**the ruler takes no action, the people have no burdens**,
and the populace lives in **prosperity and sufficiency (家给)**,
while all transformations occur naturally.

*The meaning is this:*
**Concentration and stillness (凝静)** are **calmness (定)**;
**solemn composure (端庄)** is **austerity (肃)**;
**the throne’s screen (扆龙)** is a **barrier (屏)**;
the **hall of audience (朝堂)** is where governance is heard.

The **Sage governs by non-action (无为致理)**,
transforms people without exertion (无事化人).
**He knows all without leaving his door (不出户而自知)**,
**sees all without peering through windows (不窥牖而自见)**.
**His spirit merges with the Dao (融神观妙)**,
and **creation arises from his person (造化生乎身)**.

With **mere gestures and dignified adornments (垂拱端旒)**,
the **entire cosmos is held in his hands (宇宙在乎手)**.
The people do not know their ruler exists above,
the ruler does not demand anything from the people below.
**Granaries are full, households are content—**
how is this possible?
Because **the ruler takes no action, yet the realm is at ease (国泰)**.»

The **spirit once congealed and still**,
thus **without speech, transformation is complete**.

The **screen (扆)**, is said to be **leaning (倚)**.
Its **form resembles a screen**—by day, it is the **axe-handle pattern (斧文)**,
placed within the **Bright Hall (明堂)**, where the **windows are opened** and set.

In times past, **the Duke of Zhou** assisted **King Cheng** in the **Bright Hall**,
to receive the **feudal lords (诸侯)**.
**He leaned on the axe-handle screen (负斧扆)**, **facing south while standing (南面而立)**,
to **rectify the positions of sovereign and minister (正君臣之位)**.

**The *Dao De Jing*’s *Extensive Virtue/Power* Scroll, Volume Thirty-Five** concludes.
**The *Dao De Jing*’s *Extensive Virtue/Power* Scroll, Volume Thirty-Six**—
**Master Tang Guangcheng (唐广成先生)**, **Du Guangting (杜光庭)** expounds,
**Chapter Forty-Eight of *For Learning, Daily Increase***—
**Commentary (疏)**:
The **previous chapter** elucidates **non-exertion in governance (不出不窥)**,
the **Dao of knowing without interference (不以知政理)**.
This **chapter** clarifies that **for learning, daily increase (为学日益)**,
and **for the Dao, daily decrease (为道则至乎无为之事)**.

The **first two sentences** show **the gradual stages of cultivation and dissipation (进修息遣之渐)**,
the **next three** reveal **the advantage of diminishing the self to return to non-being (损有归无之益)**,
and the **last four** conclude its meaning,
**warning that exertion (有事)** is insufficient to **transform the people (化人)**.

---
**The *Commentary* (义曰)** says:
**The teaching of governing the world (理世之教)**,
is **to diligently study and achieve success (以勤学而成功)**.
**The stages of cultivating the self (修身之阶)**,
are **to diminish knowledge and align with the Dao (以损知而契道)**.
**Diligent study brings daily progress (勤学则日益而进业)**,
**aligning with the Dao brings daily decrease to non-action (契道则日损而无为)**.

**Leaning and yielding are inherently distinct (倚伏本殊)**,
yet **words and silence mutually achieve their purpose (语默互致)**—
this **is the lesser excellence of daily increase (此明日益之为劣)**.
**To dwell in the world yet transcend it (局世居常)**,
**daily decrease is the superior approach (日损之为优)**.

**To transcend the mundane and verify the Dao (超凡证道)**,
one must **conform to the profound stillness of non-exertion (符合於不出不窥之冥寂)**.
**Beware the distractions of excessive knowledge (戒弥远弥少之烦劳)**,
**for non-action suffices to grasp the cosmic pattern (示无为可以握图)**—
**exertion cannot govern the realm (有事不足理国)**.
This **is its intent (此其旨也)**.

**For learning, daily increase (为学日益)**;
**for the Dao, daily decrease (为道日损)**.
**Annotation (注)**:
**The seeker of learning daily accumulates knowledge (为学者日益见闻)**,
**the seeker of the Dao daily diminishes deeds (为道者日损功行)**.
**Daily increase in knowledge is the stage of cultivation (益见闻为修学之渐)**,
**daily decrease in deeds is the gateway to enlightenment (损功行为悟道之门)**.
Thus, **one accumulates merit through increase (因益而积功)**,
and **forgets deeds to embody the Dao (忘功而体道)**.

---
**Commentary (疏)**:
**修为 (For),** refers to **cultivation (修为)**;
**忘损 (Decrease),** refers to **forgetting and diminishing (忘损)**.
It says: **The beginner in cultivation first seeks knowledge (初修学者日求闻见以为益)**,
**then, through this knowledge, aligns with the Dao (因益为道)**,
**and finally forgets deeds to diminish (则忘遗功行以为损)**.
Why is this so?
**The seeker of learning (为学者)**,
**all begin with daily study to grasp the Dao (初则日学以知道)**,
**cultivating deeds to rectify faults (修功而补过)**,
**until they enlighten to the principle and forget words (终则悟理而忘言)**,
**dissipate deeds and abandon attachment (遣功而去执)**.
Thus, the **annotation says: daily increase in knowledge is the initial stage of cultivation (益见闻为修学之渐)**,
**and daily decrease in deeds is the final gateway to enlightenment (损功行为悟道之门)**.

---
**The *Commentary* (义曰)** says:
**The person who studies the Dao first establishes deeds (学道之人先立功行)**,
then **forgets them (后忘其心)**,
thus **aligning with the Dao of non-action (所以契无为之道)**.
**The Dao of governing the realm (理国之道)**,
first **broadens virtue and transformation (先弘德化)**,
then **forgets progress (后忘其进)**,
thus **laying the foundation for the Great Peace (所以成太平之基也)**.
This **is also in harmony**.

**The Dao of establishing oneself (立身之道)**,
cannot **be neglected in study (不可不学)**.
*The Spring and Autumn Annals* says:
**The scholar, is one who cultivates (学者，殖也)**.
**Without study, one will decline (不学将落)**.
Thus, **the lowly become even lower, the noble fall (下陵上替)**—
how can **chaos be avoided (能无乱乎)**?
*The White Tiger’s Elegant Discussion* says:
**The scholar, is one who awakens (学者，觉也)**,
**and one who comprehends (悟也)**.
It means **the sage-kings’ Dao illuminates the nature and emotions (以先王之道开道情性)**,
**to awaken and comprehend**.

In **youth, one is confused and unaware (幼则迷昏而不悟)**,
**and cannot yet study (未可以学)**.
In **adulthood, one becomes obstinate and difficult to teach (长则悍格而难入)**,
**and cannot yet be instructed (不可以教)**.
**Study has three stages (学有三时)**.

**First, the stage within a person’s lifespan (就人身中为时者)**:
After **thirteen years of age (十三岁之后)**, one can **practice one’s profession (可以习业也)**.
Thus, *The Records of Learning* says:
**If one is not disciplined after awakening (发然而后禁)**,
then **obstinacy prevails and cannot be overcome (则悍格而不胜)**;
**if one is not aware until time has passed (时过而后觉)**,
then **diligent effort becomes difficult to achieve (则勤苦而难成)**.

**Second, the stages within the year (就年中为时者)**:
*The Inner Canon* says:
**In nurturing a child (人之养子)**,
**at six years, one teaches numeracy (六年教之数)**,
**counting up to ten, then ten to myriad ten-thousands (一至十，十至百千万也)**;
**and names the directions (与方名，东西南北也)**.
**At seven years (七年)**,
**boys and girls do not sit together (男女不同席)**,
**nor share food (不共食)**.
**At eight years (八年)**,
**when entering and exiting doors (出入门户)**,
**and when seated to eat (及即席饮食)**,
one must **follow the elders (必后於长者)**,
**to teach deference (教之让也)**.
**At nine years (九年)**,
**one teaches the days of the month and lunar phases (教之数日朔望)**,
**and the six celestial stems (与甲乙至壬癸六甲也)**.
**At ten years (十年)**,
**one goes forth to external tutors (出就外傅)**,
**lodging outside (居宿於外)**,
**to learn writing and computation (学书计)**.
**At thirteen years (十有三年)**,
**one learns the dance of the *sháo* vessel (学舞勺)**,
**to recite poetry and commit texts to memory (诵诗背文)**,
**and reading is called recitation (而读曰诵也)**.
**At fifteen years (十五年)**,
**one becomes a youth (成童)**,
**and learns the dance of the *xiàng* vessel and archery (舞象学射御)**,
**first the dance of the *yuè* vessel (先舞钥)**—
**the *yuè* resembles a flute (钥似笛)**—
**holding it to perform graceful movements (执而文舞也)**—
**then the dance of the *xiàng* vessel (后舞象)**,
**a martial dance (武舞也)**.
**At twenty, one is capped (二十而冠)**,
**and begins to learn ritual (始学礼)**.
**At thirty, one has a household (三十有室)**,
**and attends to male affairs (理男事)**,
**studying without limit (学无方)**.
**At forty, one enters officialdom (四十而仕)**,
**offering counsel and deliberation (出谋发虑)**.
**At fifty, one serves in governance (五十，服官政是也)**.

**Third, the stages within the day (就日中为时者)**:
It says **one should study according to the seasons and *qi* (随时节气受业易入)**.
*The Royal Institutions* says:
**In spring and summer, one studies poetry and music (春夏习诗乐)**.
It means **spring and summer are yang (阳)**,
**and yang embodies clarity (阳体清)**—
**poetry and music are sounds (诗乐是声)**,
**and sounds are light and clear (声以轻清故也)**.
**In autumn and winter, one studies writing and ritual (秋冬习书礼)**.
**Autumn and winter are yin (阴)**,
**and yin embodies heaviness (阴体重)**—
**writing and ritual are matters (书礼是事)**,
**and matters are weighty and turbid (事以重浊故也)**.
**To study light and clear matters in light and clear seasons (以轻清之时习轻清之业)**,
**and to study weighty and turbid matters in weighty and turbid seasons (以重浊之时习重浊之事)**,
thus **their *qi* resonates and all is easily absorbed (故其气相感，皆易入也)**.
Yet **though the three stages of study have fixed rules (然三时之学虽有定规)**,
**if one studies the good Dao (所习善道)**,
**one must never neglect it daily (日不可废)**—
how can one **be confined to these three stages (岂可拘於三时哉)**?
Thus, *The Records of Learning* says:
**Cultivate, then rest; rest, then play (斯焉修焉、息焉游焉是也)**.

**If the cultivator of the Dao (若修道之士)**,
first **pursues extensive knowledge (先务博闻)**,
then **diminishes it daily (后乃日损)**,
**returning to profound stillness (反乎冥寂)**,
**to attain cosmic penetration (以期通玄矣)**.
**Hiding is also to possess and then return to non-being (藏亦自有而归於无也)**.
**Decrease, then decrease again (损之又损之)**,
**until one reaches non-action (以至於无为)**.

---
**Commentary (疏)**:
**Decrease (损之者)**, refers to **diminishing the deeds of the Dao-seeker (损为道者之功行也)**.
**Decrease again (又损之者)**, refers to **eliminating the heart of forgetting deeds (除忘功行之心也)**.
This **is first to diminish traces (前损忘迹)**,
then **to forget the heart (后损忘心)**.
**When both heart and traces are forgotten (心迹俱忘)**,
**one has reached the ultimate (可谓造极)**,
**and thus attained non-action (则以至於无为矣)**.

---
**The *Commentary* (义曰)** says:
**The stages of cultivating the Dao (修道之阶)**,
gradually **approach its subtlety (渐臻其妙)**.
Initially, **one awakens through study (则由学而开悟)**,
**then follows cultivation through comprehension (因悟而遵修)**,
**and cultivates by establishing deeds to rectify faults (修则以立功补过)**,
**accumulating the minute to form the profound (积微成着)**.

功不在大，遇物斯拯；
过不在小，知非则恢。
过在改而不复，
为功在立而不倦。

*The Dunxuan Scripture* (《洞玄经》) says:
功满三千，白日升天；
修善有余，坐降云车。
These are all exhortations to those of common origin who aspire to the Dao,
to encourage them in establishing deeds.

The meaning of establishing deeds is manifold:
some rescue the drowning and support the perilous,
save lives and guide the dying—
if it benefits beings, one should diligently practice it.
Others cultivate inwardly by nurturing the spirit,
practicing exhalation and inhalation, refining and storing [qi],
taking elixirs and guiding movements—
monkey-like flexibility, bird-like extension—
abandoning gain and forgetting fame,
retiring the self and yielding to others—
all these are the initial gates of Daoist cultivation.

Once one has entered these gates,
the key lies in perseverance and endurance.
With perseverance and endurance,
one can accumulate virtuous deeds.

When virtuous deeds are accumulated,
one must not arrogantly rely on them,
boast before others, or claim them as one’s own.
Establish them, then forget them immediately—
when deeds are forgotten as soon as they are established,
the heart remains unobstructed.
This is called the ultimate of *double abandonment and simultaneous forgetting*.

The *Classic* says:
上德不德，是以有德；
Forgetting virtue does not mean lacking virtue—thus virtue is all the more manifest;
忘功不居，其功益广。
Forgetting deeds does not diminish them—thus deeds are all the more expansive.
This aligns with the principle of *non-action*,
establishing the foundation for immortality in one’s person.

Non-action yet nothing remains undone.

**Annotation:**
For the practitioner, deeds are accumulated;
for the Dao-seeker, deeds are diminished and forgotten.
Though one diminishes deeds, there remains the desire to diminish them.
When even this desire is forgotten,
one attains the tranquil state of non-action.

Like a mirror reflecting all forms without obstruction,
it responds to all things—
thus, nothing remains undone.

**Commentary:**
Action brings obstruction;
obstruction means there are things one cannot do.
Now, since there is non-action,
non-action means no obstruction—
thus, one can do all things.
This is called aligning with the Dao,
responding universally and comprehensively.
Hence, the upper scroll states:
*The Dao is ever non-action yet nothing remains undone.*

**Meaning:**
When deeds and the heart of forgetting are both abandoned,
the wisdom of non-action becomes self-evident.
Having attained *double abandonment*,
one merges with the Dao.
In harmony with the Dao,
one understands all things,
knows all things,
can do all things—
from the minutest grain of millet to the grandest harmony of yin, yang, and the cosmos.
Neither non-being nor being,
neither being nor non-being—
unconstrained and unrestricted,
one may then speak of the Dao.

*The Dao is ever non-action yet nothing remains undone*—
these are the words of the *Upper Scripture*, Chapter Thirty-Seven.

Take the world with *non-action*.
**Annotation:**
Non-action and non-affairs—
the world returns to harmony,
thus one can take the world.

**Commentary:**
This exhorts the sovereign to practice non-action.
"Take" means to govern by transformation.
To govern the world,
one must practice non-action,
do nothing yet govern—
when there are no affairs, the people are undisturbed;
when there is non-action, the people are naturally at ease.
With this approach,
what cannot be achieved?

"Constant" means
governing with non-affairs must never be abandoned for an instant.

**Meaning:**
"Take" means to gather.
When a state loses the Dao,
the people rebel and depart.
When a state governs by the Dao,
the people willingly submit.
Departure leads to dispersion;
submission leads to gathering.
Gathering brings prosperity and flourishing;
dispersion brings emptiness and ruin.

The method to gather the people
is always to prioritize non-affairs.

"莅" (Lì) means to govern;
"御" means to regulate;
"摄" means to attract.

As the *Commentary on the Yi Jing’s* (《易》) *Cui Hexagram* states:
萃 (Cùi), to gather.
Emotions align, then gathering occurs;
qi harmonizes, then groups form.
Thus, things of the same kind gather,
and beings form groups.
Without a leader, gathering leads to chaos—
only those with great virtue
can uphold the correct path,
achieve constant harmony,
and benefit the proper order.

The sage as leader,
the Dao fully gathered—
this is how the sage governs the state with virtue and morality,
bringing peace to the world—
thus it is called "take."

If one speaks of taking the world,
is it not beyond human strength?
Yet when affairs arise,
it is insufficient to take the world.

**Annotation:**
Affairs bring labor and turmoil;
labor and turmoil lead to exhaustion—
thus, it is insufficient to take the world.

**Commentary:**
"Affairs" refers to harsh decrees and dense prohibitions.
Harsh decrees disturb the people;
dense prohibitions multiply punishments—
the people are restless,
the four quarters disperse—
how can one then hope to govern by transformation?
Thus, when affairs arise,
it is insufficient to take the world.

**Meaning:**
The Dao and virtue form the foundation of a state.
Non-action and non-affairs are the root of gathering the people.
When affairs arise,
the people are not pacified—
only rebellion and departure follow—
thus, it is difficult to win their loyalty.

The Qin Emperor’s laws were severe, yet the people rebelled,
unifying the realm only to bring about its downfall;
The Han Emperor’s decrees were rigid, punishments frequent—
thus, the frontier regions rose in resentment.
Hence, in Qin’s later years,
laws were as strict as autumn’s scrutiny,
prohibitions as dense as congealed fat—
the wretched people had no place to rest their hands and feet.
Thus, the land collapsed like crumbling earth,
and the empire fell in a single day.

苛 (Kē): strict, minute.
烦 (Fán): urgent, chaotic.

「Thus, he who governs his body must always maintain non-action,
then his heart will be at ease and his spirit serene.
When affairs arise,
his spirit will be strained and his heart disturbed.
Disturbance leads to the loss of the Dao,
ease aligns with the True—
one must be ever vigilant.

**Chapter Forty-Nine: The Sage’s Unchanging Heart**
**Commentary:**
The previous chapter elucidated the daily depletion of the Dao,
demonstrating the path of cultivation and forgetting.
This chapter reveals the Sage’s lack of a fixed heart,
illustrating the application of an open mind to respond to all things.
The first six words establish the Sage’s unchanging heart in responding to all things;
the next two show the Sage blending with the common and yet employing a heart;
the final two conclude with the reason why the people return to goodness,
clarifying the Sage’s virtue of nurturing them all.

**Meaning:**
The governance of a state lies in maintaining non-action,
responding to transformations lies in an open heart.
An open heart means responding to all things without constancy,
non-action means enduringly facing the people.
Thus, whether good or not good,
one responds with goodness;
whether transforming or not transforming,
one guides with sincerity—
trustworthy or untrustworthy,
one responds with trust—
trust without fail.
This is the so-called harmonizing heart and blending transformations,
where all nations find peace and are soothed,
all as infants.
This is the Sage’s grand intent.

The Sage’s heart is without constancy,
for his responses arise from the stirrings of things.
Responses emerge from those stirrings,
thus his heart is without constancy.
Though his heart is not fixed,
it lies in transforming goodness,
constantly taking the hearts of the people as his own.

**Commentary:**
The Sage’s heart is open;
when things stir, he responds.
Response must come from profound intuition.
Since intuition varies,
his responses lack a fixed heart.
Though his heart is not fixed,
his intent remains in compassion and salvation.
For the people have hearts of distrust and unkindness,
thus he blends with them and guides through transformation.
Hence, it is said: *The Sage’s heart is without constancy.*

**Meaning:**
The Way is vast, yet it encompasses all;
subtle, yet it penetrates everywhere—
this is the Great Dao.
Transformations are all-encompassing,
responses arise without fail—
this is the Sage.
Since the Sage’s transformations are universal,
his heart is without constancy.
Those who follow goodness naturally respond through intuition,
those who do not are also led to enlightenment.
Only virtue aids this,
no one abandons another,
spreading compassion universally,
leaving no trace unnoticed—
thus, the Sage’s heart is without constancy,
yet never obstructed.

*To the good, I respond with goodness.*
**Commentary:**
This is the meaning of responding through intuition.
*I* refers to the Sage.
The good are those whose minds return to the True Dao;
the Sage encourages their cultivation,
fulfilling their actions,
leading them to the ultimate goodness—
forgetting goodness itself.

**Meaning:**
Goodness arises from the heart,
its name defined by contrast to evil.
Goodness is revealed through evil,
and when goodness prevails, evil perishes.
Since the people are good,
the Sage responds with goodness,
thus drawing them forward.

*To the ungood, I respond with the virtue of goodness.*
**Commentary:**
The ungood are those steeped in corrupt habits,
clinging to falsehood and abandoning the Dao.
The Sage also leads them with goodness,
drawing them toward enlightenment.
The virtue of goodness means
transforming their hearts to align with the Sage’s virtuous teachings.

**Meaning:**
The people do not know goodness can be cultivated,
evil can be changed—
accumulated habits breed corruption,
and they are lost in delusion.
The Sage pities their stubborn ignorance,
using goodness to guide and transform them.
Only through the Sage’s great function can evil be turned to goodness.
No one is abandoned—
this is where it lies.

Those who cling to falsehood
are like the world’s people who do not know the True Dao,
lost in the depths of error—
like the summer insect doubting ice,
or the well-frog scornful of the sea—
their fixed views seal their errant hearts.
The Sage also entices and teaches them,
distinguishing falsehood from truth,
leading them to goodness.

*To the trustworthy, I respond with trust.*
**Commentary:**
Trust refers to those who hear the Dao and diligently practice it,
holding no doubts in their hearts.
The Sage responds with sincerity,
praising their goodness,
until they reach deep trust.

**Meaning:**
Trust also arises from the heart,
its contrast defined by doubt.
Trust is established through doubt,
and when trust prevails, doubt is forgotten.
Since the people are trustworthy,
the Sage responds with trust,
thus encouraging their resolve.

*To the untrustworthy, I respond with the virtue of trust.*
**Annotation:**
To those who desire goodness and trust,
I respond with goodness and trust;
to those who do not,
I also teach them with goodness and trust.
I wish the people to be moved by my virtue,
thus cultivating goodness and trust.

**Commentary:**
The untrustworthy are those obstinate and rebellious,
rejecting teachings.
The Sage also leads them with equal and true trust,
transforming them to abandon falsehood and return to trust.
Thus, it is said: *the virtue of trust.*
**Meaning:**
The people’s stagnation in worldly ways
breeds doubt from accumulated habits—
they do not know trust can be practiced,
doubt can be discarded,
clinging to doubt and delusion,
distrusting the True.
Like those who forget their return,
or the lower scholars’ great laughter,
the Sage also gradually opens their understanding
with the principles of true trust.
Knowing to trust and discard doubt
relies on the Sage’s virtue.
The virtue of trust, the virtue of goodness—
here lies their essence.

Those who stubbornly cling to falsehood
believe doubt is right,
trust is wrong—
like the summer insect doubting ice,
or the well-frog scornful of the sea—
their fixed views seal their errant hearts.
The Sage also entices and teaches them,
distinguishing trust from doubt,
leading them to trust.

Thus, to draw them toward goodness and trust,
the Sage fears they may incur guilt through doubt,
suffer calamity from clinging to evil.
He encourages and exhorts them,
out of profound pity for all beings and compassion for things.

The Sage moves through the world with anxious care,
blending the hearts of all under heaven.
**Annotation:**
The Sage, in governing the world,
transforms and leads the people—
his heart is always anxious and diligent,
guiding them toward goodness and trust.
Yet the Sage remains still and serene,
his virtue radiant like a full moon,
his heart blended and unified,
all for the sake of the people—
thus, it is said: *he blends the hearts of all under heaven.*

**Commentary:**
This reveals the Sage’s blending and diligent use of his heart.
*Axious care* means anxious and diligent.
The Sage governs with tolerance,
unifying all within the world—
fearing the people do not return to goodness and trust,
thus his anxious care.
Yet the Sage’s heart is without constancy—
what then does he fear or rejoice in?»

The Sage’s anxious care today arises only because the people of the world have yet to embrace goodness and trust. Thus, the Sage blends himself with all things, yet his heart remains ever engaged. Therefore, it is said: *"For the sake of the world, he blends their hearts."*

Its meaning is this: The Sage responds to Heaven and governs the times, follows the people and reaches the utmost limits—his carriage adorned with yellow canopies and green banners, his robes trailing with pendants. Though his body rests within the nine palaces, his heart extends to all ten thousand realms. He discerns the crooked and upright among ministers and subjects, understands the toil of farming and harvest, pardons faults and lightens punishments, reduces taxes and levies. Though his spirit is deep and unyielding, his heart is ever anxious and burdened with care, guiding the wicked and transforming doubt, leading them to return to goodness and trust. Yet the Sage remains serene and still, as if without thought—because his mind is without attachment, all things settle and transform of their own accord.

*Yòu* means to be wide and simple in governance. Because of this breadth and simplicity, the Dao flows freely.
*Hùn* means the inner and outer merge and blend, without distinction.

The people all turn their ears and eyes toward him.
**Annotation:** The people, transformed by the Sage’s virtue, incline their ears and eyes, all listening and observing the Sage.
**Commentary:** The people, moved by the Sage’s pure virtue, turn to his teachings and emulate his conduct. Thus, they all incline their ears and eyes to listen and observe him.

Its meaning is this: Where the Sage’s virtue reaches, all follow suit, the ruler sets the example and the subjects respond. All creatures under the four seas strain their ears to hear his words and their eyes to witness his deeds. This is how they align with the Dao.

*Tīng* means to listen attentively.
*Guàn* means to observe thoroughly.

The Sage treats them all like infants.
**Annotation:** The Sage pities the common folk as a mother pities her children. In all his gaze upon the people, he sees them as infants.
**Commentary:** Since the people have turned their ears and eyes to the Sage, when he looks upon them, it is as a mother looks upon her children. Hence, it is said: *"He treats them all like infants."* Another interpretation: The people have discriminating minds, but the Sage transforms them to follow goodness, making them like infants—without distinction.

Its meaning is this: The Sage of the Dao nurtures all things with compassion, and all things respond to him as to a mother. The Sage regards them as infants. Thus, virtue and the Dao circulate freely, the upper and lower realms resonate in harmony, and the people live in peace and prosperity—how could this not be fitting?

For those who cultivate their own bodies: treasure *qi* and conserve spirit. When *qi* is whole, spirit reigns. If form and spirit are firmly united, then life’s measure extends, and the way of immortals may be attained.

The Sage transforms them to do good, enticing them to cultivate the True. First, he dispels unwholesome thoughts and records their virtuous deeds. Once virtuous actions take root, he forgets the necessity of doing good—without knowing, without doing, unassuming and unboastful, pure and silent, inner and outer merged, like infants without distinction—this is truly in accord with the Dao.

**Chapter Fifty: On Birth and Death**

**Commentary:** The previous chapter expounds on the Sage’s blending and unity, responding to the actions of goodness and trust. This chapter elucidates birth and death, opening the gate to transcending suffering and entanglement. The first five sentences mark those who dwell in ease and harmony with the times; the next five clarify those who explore change and transformation; the final eight conclude the practice of virtue, demonstrating the path to longevity and clear vision.

Its meaning is this: The virtue of Heaven and Earth is greatest in birth. Having attained life, one must uphold the Dao to preserve it, nourish spirit to sustain it. Coming is not met with pride, going is not met with fear. One does not cling to life at the cost of the Dao, nor exceed one’s measure and harm life—this is to dwell in ease and harmony with the times.

Those who are confused seek life too greedily and thus lose it. Those who practice virtue arrive at life through the Dao, secure from harm, for they dwell beyond the realm of death. Truly, this is the way.

Speaking of dwelling in ease and harmony with the times, *Zhuangzi*’s *"Great Master"* chapter has Zixi saying to Ziyu: *"To gain is to follow the times; to lose is to follow harmony. Dwelling in ease and harmony with the times, sorrow and joy cannot enter."* This is what the ancients called *suspension of entanglement*—yet those who cannot free themselves are bound by things.

This speaks of those who attain life: life is given by the times. Those who lose death: death is met through harmony. To dwell in life and embrace life is to grasp life’s principle; to dwell in death and embrace death is to grasp death’s principle. When there is neither life nor death, how can there be joy or sorrow? This is the ancient *True Person*, unbound by anything.

If one clings to life while fearing death, the sorrow of excess will come. Those who know this are ensnared by the sorrow and joy of life and death.

The way of longevity and clear vision is the language of this text’s fifty-ninth chapter: *Birth and Death*.
**Annotation:** Enlightenment brings birth; delusion brings death. This is the heading.
**Commentary:** To awaken to life and death, not to cling to life excessively—this is birth. To be ensnared in the illusions of self and other, moving toward death—this is death. This marks the chapter’s theme.

Its meaning is this: Original essence spreads *qi*, the Great Alchemist shapes form. Drawing from the Yang harmony, one attains birth; returning to the Yin stillness, one enters death. Now to clarify the path to halt death and prolong life, and the causes that lead to losing life and hastening death. This heading seems like a question, answered fully in the following sentences.

There are thirteen types of those who attain life.
**Commentary:** *Tú* means "kind" or "category." Here, it broadly discusses those who can dwell in ease with the times, grasp life’s principle, and have no attachment to coming or going. Such people are few—only three in ten.

Its meaning is this: Those who do not take life as joy but dwell in ease with it—these are the types who attain life. When life is upon them, they do not let desire or profit disturb their hearts, nor do they harm their nature through excessive nourishment. Dwelling in simplicity and silence, following the natural flow, their spirit guards their form, their *qi* preserves their spirit, their will harmonizes with their *qi*, their heart stills within their will. Thus, they do not seek to prolong life—life prolongs itself.

There are thirteen types of those who attain death.
**Commentary:** *This broadly discusses how all beings, when facing life, dwell in ease and grasp life’s principle, and when facing death, follow it and grasp death’s principle. Such people are few—only three in ten.*

**Exposition:** *This also broadly discusses the Dao of dwelling in death without resistance, accepting transformation, and finding harmony in departure. Such people are also few—only three in ten.*

Its meaning is this: When death approaches, one does not regard it as sorrow but follows it, and these are the types who attain death. The enlightened in their worldly affairs understand the cyclical nature of existence and nonexistence, knowing how the Dao’s transformations unfold with natural ease. Those who are endowed with a thick constitution of *yang* and harmonizing *qi* will live long, while those whose constitution is thin and lacks purity will die young.

If one knows that longevity and early death both arise from one’s inherent constitution, then life and death can be balanced.
When life and death are balanced, then sorrow and joy do not intrude, and one remains composed without hindrance to body or mind.

Moreover, the *Skull-and-Crossbones* passage in *Zhuangzi* says:
*"In death, there is no lord above, no subject below, no affairs of the four seasons—one floats freely, taking heaven and earth as spring and autumn. Though ruling with the south facing, no joy could surpass this."*

*Zhuangzi* did not believe this, saying:
*"I wish to make the Lord of Life restore your vitality—is that possible?"*

The *Skull-and-Crossbones* replied with furrowed brow and knitted brows:
*"How could I abandon the joy of ruling with the south facing and return to the labor of being a living person?"*

Though this is a metaphorical illustration of a principle, *Zhuangzi* considered that those who delight in life are enslaved by life, while those who delight in death are bound by death. They are entangled in life and death, and only the *reach* (至人) transcends them—living without life, dying without death. They are not enslaved by life nor bound by death.

Since they are neither bound nor enslaved, they can transcend life and death.
Yet, transformation into life cannot be stopped, nor can transformation into death be delayed—only by aligning with the Great Dao can one attain true mastery over life and death.

As for those who emerge beyond death’s grasp and seek eternal life, it lies in cultivating the *True* (修真) and refining the form (炼形). One may discuss its profound mysteries with them.

Life is perilously close to death—thirteen types.
**Commentary:** *Those who overindulge in life’s nourishment harm their vitality through excessive care, and since they cling to this life, they court death’s domain. Thus, they lose both life’s principle and death’s principle. Such people are also few—only three in ten.*

**Exposition:** *This explains those who, in their delusion, cannot grasp the Dao of life and death and thus fall into death’s domain. Though they seek to preserve life, they fail to understand its principle. The principle of dwelling in life is lost, and the Dao of following death is abandoned. Such people are also few—only three in ten.*

Its meaning is this: The foolish and deluded do not know that those who nurture life without understanding its true nature do not attain life, nor do those who transform without insight grasp transformation. They take life as joy and death as sorrow, fearing death and craving life, thus overindulging in life’s preservation. If they seek life contrary to its Dao, they only hasten their own demise—three in ten, roughly speaking.

Another explanation states: Human life is shaped by three *karmas* (业) and ten *evils* (恶). The three *karmas* are:
1. *Body* (身),
2. *Heart* (心),
3. *Speech* (口)—these are the *karmas*.
The ten *evils* are:
- *Body-karma* has three evils: 1. killing life, 2. theft, 3. licentiousness (邪淫);
- *Heart-karma* also has three evils: 1. greed, 2. anger, 3. ignorance;
- *Speech-karma* has four evils: 1. two-tonguedness (两舌), 2. foul speech (恶口), 3. falsehood (妄言), 4. frivolous talk (绮语).
These three *karmas* and ten *evils* together form thirteen.

If one can master and subdue the three *karmas* and ten *evils*, then the Dao of eternal life may be attained—these are the types who attain life, from these thirteen.

If one indulges in the three *karmas* and ten *evils*, then they rush toward death—these are the types who attain death, from these thirteen.

Moreover, beings’ virtues are hard to cultivate, but evils are easily formed. The three *karmas* and ten *evils* are daily transgressed, and each transgression is a path to death.
Thus, it is said that life’s perilous proximity to death arises from these thirteen.

The three *karmas* and ten *evils* are the roots of all offenses. Abandoning them allows one to transcend life, while practicing them leads one into death. The precepts for cultivating the body are the most urgent.

These ten *evils* each have four *causes* (缘), all serving as the basis for affliction and suffering. Which are these?
- In the offense of killing life, there are four causes: 1. the being is truly alive, 2. the thought of the being arises, 3. the intention to kill arises, 4. the act of severing another’s life is carried out.
- In the offense of theft, there are also four causes: 1. the object is truly another’s, 2. the thought of the object arises, 3. the intention to steal arises, 4. the object is moved from its rightful place.
- In the offense of licentiousness, there are four causes: 1. the setting is truly licentious, 2. the thought of the licentious setting arises, 3. the licentious desire is kindled, 4. the body partakes in tainted, pleasurable deeds.
- In the offense of two-tonguedness, there are four causes: 1. the person heard is real, 2. the thought of that person arises, 3. the intention to separate arises, 4. divisive and slanderous speech is uttered.
- In the offense of foul speech, there are four causes: 1. the person reviled is real, 2. the thought of that person arises, 3. the intention to revile arises, 4. foul reviling speech is uttered.
- In the offense of falsehood, there are four causes: 1. the person deceived is real, 2. the thought of that person arises, 3. the intention to deceive arises, 4. false and contradictory statements are made.
- In the offense of frivolous talk, there are four causes: 1. the person addressed is real, 2. the thought of that person arises, 3. the intention to speak frivolously arises, 4. unrighteous words are spoken.

In total, these ten *evils* and three *karmas* comprise fifty-three conditions. Each transgression of these offenses leads one to death’s domain.
Beware! Be cautious!

Why is this so?
**Exposition:** *This poses a question about the causes of life’s proximity to death.*

Its meaning is this: To grasp the essence of transformation and the reasons leading to death, one must examine the following:
- The thickness of one’s constitution in life.
**Commentary:** *The reason life is so perilously close to death is due to these causes.*

But it is because their attachment to this life is too excessive. **Commentary:** This directly answers why mortals are drawn to death’s domain: for they indulge in transient existence, drown in emotional desires, and lavishly nourish themselves to preserve life. When their constitution is too thickly sustained, they are thus drawn to death’s domain.

**Exposition:** The heavens bestow upon humankind with great affection:
- The five flavors nourish them,
- The five colors adorn them,
- The five sounds delight them,
- The five fragrances amuse them,
- The five utilities serve them,
- The five *qi* harmonize them,
- The five senses govern them,
- The five *Wei* (celestial patterns) oversee them,
- The five teachings exhort them,
- The five constants (of human nature) they inherit,
- The five blessings attend them.

They dwell at the head of the five *Ling* (spirits), and are the sovereign of all things. Yet do they not cherish themselves and preserve this love? Instead, they yield to desires and gratify their emotions, fearing death while loving life. When nourishment is excessive, they invite death upon themselves—not through Heaven’s wrath or the gods’ reproach, but by the very excess of their attachment to life.

Thus, the prior fifty-three conditions of the ten *evils* and three *karmas*—when violated, can there truly be no transgression?

Moreover, those who rush forward perish, while the boldly retreating are wounded. Only those who strike a balance can deliberate upon refining their conduct.

For those who excel in preserving life:
**Commentary:** *Sui* (to preserve) is also *wei* (to guard). It refers to those who skillfully guard life with the Dao, subtly observing its origins. Originally pure and tranquil, they forget life in life itself, not letting emotional desires disrupt their harmony. They cultivate their nature through emptiness and spontaneity, and nothing can harm them.

Thus, they are called "excellently preserving."

**Exposition:** Life has limits, yet worldly affairs do not. With life’s finite nature enslaved to boundless pursuits, how can one avoid harm?

Those who excel in preserving life treat affairs as nonexistent, thus preserving their harmony. They do not ensnare their hearts with desires nor injure themselves with gain. They entrust their spontaneity and emptiness to natural flow, resting in stillness to embrace the true essence. Forgotten in life, life is fully preserved; aligned with the Dao, the Dao governs itself. In the chamber of emptiness, purity arises; in the heart of stillness, the mysterious is attained. This is the excellence of preserving life.

When traveling by land, they do not encounter rhinoceros or tigers; when entering battle, they are not harmed by armor or weapons.
**Commentary:** *Encounter* (*yu*) means to meet unexpectedly. According to the *Shan Hai Jing* (Classic of Mountains and Seas), the rhinoceros (*si*) emerges from the south of the Xiang River, blackish-green in hue. The *Er Ya* (Erya) states: "Its form resembles a wild ox, with a single horn weighing a thousand *jin* (pounds)."

Those who excel in preserving life do not harbor malicious intent toward creatures. Thus, when traveling by land, they do not seek to meet rhinoceros or tigers; when entering battle, they are not struck by armored soldiers or weapons. This is why tigers, rhinoceros, and weapons cannot harm them.

**Exposition:** The Xiang River and the Liu River flow from the Nine Doubt Mountains and Lingling, where rhinoceros and tigers reside. Both tigers and rhinoceros are creatures that harm humans. The rhinoceros harms with its horn, the tiger with its claws, and weapons wound in battle. To encounter them is to invite harm; to confront them is to risk injury. Yet those who excel in preserving life do not intervene in battles or weapons, so they are not wounded by them. Nor do they seek to meet tigers or rhinoceros, so they are not harmed by them.

In ancient times, the Jin scholar Guo Wenzhi (文举), residing in the Da Di Mountain (大涤山) of Yu Hang, coexisted with a fierce tiger. Whenever he left the city, the tiger would follow. Someone asked him: "Master, do you possess the Dao? Why does the beast submit to you so docilely?"

Wenzhi replied: "Humans have no intent to harm the beast, and the beast has no intent to harm humans. What else is there to it?"

The rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn, the tiger no place to strike with its claws, and weapons no place to lodge their blades.
**Annotation:** Those who excel in guarding life’s principles, with their hearts illuminated by purity, harbor no greed or malice. Thus, all external creatures cannot harm them. When traveling by land, they do not seek to meet rhinoceros or tigers; when entering battle, they are not struck by armored soldiers or weapons. This is because they do not provoke harm, so creatures have no means to harm them.

**Commentary:** Earlier, it was shown that those who excel in preserving life have no malicious intent within. Thus, externally, they do not seek to meet rhinoceros or tigers. If they were to encounter them, their lack of harming intent would naturally prevent the creatures from having any place to strike or lodge their weapons. Therefore, one knows that if emotions are forgotten toward creatures, then even seafaring gulls can be tamed and played with, and land-dwelling beasts can be leashed and ridden—how much more so when harm is not intended?

Thus, there is no such harm.

**Exposition:** Those who excel in preserving life align their nature with the Dao. Their benevolent hearts extend broadly, and they harbor no intent to harm others. Their harmonious *qi* fills them internally, so creatures do not seize upon them to harm. Even if they meet rhinoceros or tigers, there will be no claw or horn wounds; or if they face battle, there will be no blade injuries. For their virtue and power are complete, all creatures submit to them in gentleness.

There was a man who lived by the sea, and his son often played with seafaring gulls at the shore. His father found this strange and went to observe. The son arrived first at the place where they had played before, and the gulls, seeing him, flew about but did not alight. Because he had no scheming heart, the gulls approached him. But now that he has scheming intentions, they do not alight.

Thus, if one has the intent to harm creatures, will tigers and rhinoceros not strike or wound them? What is not wounded is the absence of scheming intent within.

According to the *Transmission of the Immortals* (《神仙传》), Liu Gang (字伯鸾), with his wife, Lady Fan (樊夫人), both attained the Dao of the immortals. When Liu Gang was the magistrate of Shangyu, he visited the Sifang Mountains (四明山) and encountered a tiger. The tiger, seeing him, bowed and did not dare rise, and he told his wife about it. Lady Fan went straight toward it and, with a rope, bound the tiger and brought it home, treating it like a household dog. This was the power of virtue and Dao.

*Diao* (to place) means to set; *rong* (to contain) means to receive; *xia* (to tame) means to approach closely and familiarize.
There is no place for claws to strike or blades to lodge.

**Why is this so?**
**Commentary:** This asks why tigers, rhinoceros, and weapons—harmful to humans—do not strike, place, or lodge their claws, horns, or blades against those who excel in preserving life. It is a rhetorical question to enlighten humans.

**Exposition:** To further clarify that those who excel in preserving life are not drawn to death’s domain, the question is posed again, urging them to strive in their cultivation.

Because there is no place of death.

**Annotation:** *Why* do rhinoceros, tigers, armor, and weapons have no place to strike or lodge their claws, horns, or blades? It is because they follow the natural order without selfishness, not treating death as death. Thus, things cannot harm their life. Hence, it is said there is no place of death.

**Commentary:** This is the direct answer. Those who see the burden of their physical form as a hindrance to life’s continuity perish. But those who excel in preserving life perceive the emptiness of inherent existence (*dharma-nature*), understand the illusory nature of the self, and thus forget life in the act of living. They do not overindulge in nourishment, follow the natural order without selfishness, and thus have no place of death to dwell in. If the mind harbors no place of death, how could tigers, rhinoceros, or weapons harm their life?

**Exposition:** The great Sage expounds this scripture, broadly proclaiming the essentials of the Dao/Way, wishing all to cultivate virtue. If all cherish life and cultivate virtue, they will have no faults or blemishes. Cherishing life means embracing Dao and virtue, while lacking faults or blemishes means avoiding death’s domain. Embracing Dao and virtue leads to longevity, and thus there will be no injuries from weapons, claws, or horns—one may attain the pure and tranquil Dao of the Immortal Adept.

A ruler who governs by virtue does not rely on the might of arms; the four borders remain in harmony, and even the three-sided nets of the hunt are opened, with beasts dancing in submission—what harm could they inflict?

*Completion of Volume Thirty-Six of the Broad Explication of the True Scripture of Dao and Virtue*
*Commencement of Volume Thirty-Seven of the Broad Explication of the True Scripture of Dao and Virtue*

「The *Broad Explication of the True Scripture of Dao and Virtue* by Master Broad-achievement (Du Guangting) of the Tang Dynasty—Explication of Chapter Fifty-One on *Dao-Generating Virtue*:

The preceding chapter elucidates the birth and death of the Dao, skillfully guiding one beyond the gates of suffering and entanglement. This chapter clarifies how the Dao generates virtue and nurtures life, without slaughtering what is naturally noble.

First, it extols the wondrous origin of the Dao, which gives rise to the marvel of life’s creation. Next, it reveals why all things hold the Dao and virtue in highest esteem, for the Dao generates life. Finally, it praises the function of nurturing life, which the Dao accomplishes without possession.

*Explication*:

The Dao is the wondrous origin, capable of generating all beings. Virtue is the manifestation of the Dao, able to nurture all forms. Moving creatures belong to Heaven, while rooted plants align with Earth. What Heaven and Earth cultivate, what the Transformations create—none can arise without the Dao’s *qi*, none can flourish without the Dao’s virtue. All things stand by the Dao and rely on its power.

Among those with feeling and awareness, and those without, all revere the Dao and honor virtue, never forgetting that the Dao is their ultimate source. It is the most revered by all things—not because of noble titles or the weight of authority, but because abandoning the Dao leads to ruin. How much more so for the sovereign who faces south: without the Dao, there is no peace.

The labor of cultivating true refinement in all lands depends on the Dao. Yet the Dao, among all things, never boasts of its own achievements; its virtue and power grow ever more profound and mysterious.

The Dao generates life—
*Annotation*: The wondrous origin moves and harmonizes the *qi* of all things.

Virtue nurtures life—
*Annotation*: Things receive the Dao’s virtue to sustain and nourish all forms.

*Explication*: "The Dao generates life" refers to the Dao descending the harmonizing *qi* of the cosmos, molding all things, so that all things, receiving it, are born. Thus it is called "the Dao generates life." The annotation "the wondrous origin moves and harmonizes the *qi*" means: the wondrous origin is the Dao itself. When the supreme Dao descends to harmonize the *qi*, it serves as the root for all things, hence "wondrous origin."

"Virtue nurtures life" means: virtue is the *obtained* power, and nurturing is the *sustaining*. All things receive the Dao’s virtue and thus are able to sustain their forms; this is why it is called "virtue nurtures life."

*Explication*: If one generates without nurturing, virtue cannot display its power. If one nurtures without generating, the Dao cannot reveal its marvel. Generation begins with the emergence from non-being, while nurturing concludes with the sustenance of being. The cycle of beginning and end flows continuously, with the Dao as the foundation, hence "wondrous origin."

Without the Dao’s movement and virtue, there would be no life. Once life is bestowed, it depends on nurturing. This is the principle of mutual reliance.

The Dao endows things with form—
*Annotation*: Heaven knows the beginning, Earth creates the forms and positions.

The Dao fulfills their potential—
*Annotation*: The forces of cold and heat each complete their own transformations.

*Explication*: The Dao generates and virtue nurtures, so all things manifest their forms. The annotation "Heaven knows the beginning, Earth creates the forms and positions" states: The *I Ching*’s [missing text] says, "Heaven knows the great beginning, Earth creates all things." The upper and lower realms are their forms, while the high and low are their positions. All this is the Dao’s work, entrusted to Heaven and Earth for its execution.

"Fulfills their potential" refers to the Dao’s role in shaping all things through the forces of Heaven, Earth, and the interplay of yin and yang. Things draw upon these forces to complete their transformations, hence "fulfills their potential."

*Explication*: The birth of all things is through the Dao’s virtue and power, which endow them with *qi*. Their forms arise from Heaven and Earth’s transformations, relying on the cycles of cold and heat, and the resources of yin and yang, to be born, to take form, to reach completion, and to return to the beginning. Birth, completion, return, and origin—this is what is called "potential."

"Heaven knows the beginning" means: beginning is the first principle. Heaven is the yang *qi* of the sky; all things first receive the yang *qi* of Heaven and are born. "Earth creates all things" means: Earth is the yin *qi* of the ground; all things receive the yin *qi* of Earth and take form.

Though life and transformation are divided into moving and rooted forms, they still depend on the *qi* of cold and heat to fulfill their purpose. Yet the root of all life and transformation lies in the Dao—how could Heaven, Earth, cold, or heat alone bring about life and transformation? Therefore, all things without fail honor the Dao and esteem virtue.

*Annotation*: All things are generated and nurtured by the Dao and virtue, hence they honor and esteem them.

*Explication*: Since the Dao and virtue possess the power to generate and nurture, all who cherish life naturally honor the Dao and respect virtue. This is an exhortation to all beings, urging them to strengthen their foundation and exalt the Dao.

*Explication*: "Honor" refers to the high and elevated, likened to a father. "Esteem" refers to the profound and respectful, likened to a mother. The Dao generates and virtue nurtures; things receive their forms from it. If the Dao and virtue are the father and mother of all things, how could they not be honored and esteemed?

If one forgets this root, one is no longer human. The Dao’s honor and virtue’s esteem are not conferred by titles but are ever naturally so. The Dao’s virtue and power are not dependent on official rank but are constantly and naturally honored and esteemed by all things.

*Annotation*: It states that the Dao’s honor and virtue are not conferred by titles; only the function of generating and nurturing is bestowed upon things, and thus they are naturally honored and esteemed.

*Explication*: For human beings in the world, the highest duty is to serve the sovereign. Those with talent and ability are elevated and employed by the sovereign, who then bestows titles upon them and honors their worth. Such esteem, however, has its limits.

But the Dao generates life and is honored by all things; virtue nurtures life and is esteemed by all things. Generation never ceases, so the function of generating life is eternally honored. Transformation never ends, so the function of nurturing things is without limit. Thus, it is ever honored and ever esteemed—how could there be a time when it reaches exhaustion?

Next to this is Confucius, who through literary teaching, propagated the five constants of the Dao, and was revered by all kings for millennia. The Duke of Zhou, through martial teaching, transmitted the seven virtues, and was esteemed by all kings for millennia. Yan Hui and Min Ziqin cultivated virtue through conduct, while the two sages Yi and Qi upheld benevolence and righteousness. The Ten Paragons embodied the four categories of excellence, leaving their legacy to posterity, which every dynasty upholds and follows.»

This is indeed not the rank and title bestowed by contemporary rulers, yet its virtue is ever honored and ever esteemed. But the profound function is vast and boundless, not relying on the supreme Dao of the Primordial Sovereign’s moral virtue and power.

Now, rank and title—these are what sovereigns hold dear when they honor the worthy and appoint officials. In antiquity, emperors and kings, faced with the vast multitude and the expanse of the four quarters, could not govern alone. Thus, they established offices and conferred ranks to lead the people. Rank is the grant of stipend and station; title is the designation of status. When properly ordered, offices do not become corrupt, and corruption-free offices ensure each is matched to their talents. Thus, all things are governed.

Offices are the means of administration—like the warp in a net or the collar of a garment. When the warp and collar are held, all things fall into order. Hence, the Great Yu organized offices by the dragon, Shennong by fire, the Yellow Emperor by clouds, and Shaohao by birds, each using their auspicious symbols to establish their offices. From Shaohao onward, virtue did not extend far, and other things could not be used to confer ranks; instead, the people were taken as the standard, all assisting the Son of Heaven in governing the four seas.

The Tang and Yu dynasties followed ancient precedents, establishing a hundred offices. The Xia and Shang doubled them, yet they too succeeded in governance. Regional governors administered customs, and merit was recorded to bestow ranks and stipends, lending them honor and weight, so that all things looked up to and followed their teachings. The Sage on high, with the worthy as assistants, were like fish and water, inseparable.

The highest ranks were those of the Sovereign, Emperor, King, and Lord. Below them were the Dukes, Marquises, Earls, Viscounts, and Barons, ranking five grades of states. Thus, within the imperial domain, each of the four directions had a *dianfu* of five hundred *li*, making a thousand *li* in total. Within this thousand *li*, five grades of tribute were paid: at one hundred *li*, straw and husks; at two hundred *li*, ears of grain; at three hundred *li*, stalks and husks; at four hundred *li*, millet; at five hundred *li*, rice. Beyond the *dianfu*, five hundred *li* outward was the *houfu*, divided into three grades: one hundred *li* for *cai* (tribute states), serving only royal affairs; two hundred *li* for *nanfang* (male states), tasked with royal duties; three hundred *li* for the feudal lords, who acted as scouts to defend the king. These three together formed one category.

Beyond the *houfu*, five hundred *li* outward was the *suifu* (pacified service). *Sui* means "to pacify," and its people followed the king’s teachings alone. It too had two grades: three hundred *li* for *kui* (cultural instruction), measuring and applying the king’s cultural teachings; one hundred *li* for *fenwu* (martial defense), the means by which the realm was secured.

Beyond the *suifu*, five hundred *li* outward was the *yaofu* (restricted service). *Yao* means "to bind," restraining with order to pacify cultural instruction. It too had two grades: three hundred *li* for *yi* (the tranquil), upholding ordinary teachings and serving the king alone; and beyond that, two hundred *li* for *cai* (the regulated), simplified and streamlined.

Beyond the *yaofu*, five hundred *li* outward was the *huangfu* (barbaric service), speaking to its remoteness and simplicity. It too had two grades: three hundred *li* for the *man* (uncivilized), drawn in by cultural virtue without coercion by law; and two hundred *li* for the *liu* (nomadic), where governance followed their customs as far as its reach extended.

The Five Services thus extended five thousand *li*, divided into fourteen grades, differing by distance.

Moreover, according to *The Rites of Zhou*, the states of Dukes and Marquises were each a hundred *li* in extent; those of regional lords were seventy *li*; and those of Viscounts and Barons were fifty *li*. This was the ancient system of establishing offices and ranks, grading them by hierarchy to assist the emperor and king in governing the realm. They received the emperor’s rank and title to lead the people.

Thus, the Dao generates and nurtures—
*Cushion*: This concludes the initial chapter’s meaning of the Dao generating.
At first, it generates; then it nurtures.
*Explanation*: Initially, it was said that the Dao generates and virtue nurtures, but now it only says the Dao generates and nurtures. Yet virtue is the function of the Dao, and both generating and nurturing things are the Dao’s dynamic operations. Hence, virtue is not mentioned again.

It lengthens and fosters—
*Cushion*: "Lengthen" means to advance; "foster" means to nurture.
*Explanation*: Once all things are generated, the seasons of yin and yang, the forces of cold and heat, advance and nurture them—not by human effort, but by the Dao’s power.

It completes and matures—
*Cushion*: "Completes" means to assist; "matures" means to bring to fulfillment.
*Explanation*: The Dao having generated all things, autumn harvests and winter ripening are also the Dao’s operation of the four seasons’ *qi* to bring them to completion and maturity. "Assist" means to aid; "relative" means to assist.

It nourishes and covers—
*Annotation*: Hence, no one fails to honor the Dao and esteem virtue.
*Cushion*: "Nourishes" means to provide; "covers" means to shelter. The eight functions are all the operations of moral virtue and power, by which all things honor and esteem it.
*Explanation*: Generate, nurture, lengthen, foster, complete, mature, nourish, and cover—these eight benefit things, all the profound functions of moral virtue and power. Thus, heaven, man, and all things—those with awareness and emotion, down to the lowly and the moving, the plants—none fail to benefit from the Dao’s transformative functions and have life. How could they not honor and esteem it, revering the wondrous origin?

It generates yet does not possess—
*Cushion*: The Dao generates all things, yet does not see itself as having generated them. It forgets the function of generation, concluding the meaning of the Dao generating above.
*Explanation*: The Dao can generate things, yet does not claim ownership, while things receive the Dao’s function, and the Dao does not boast of its power.

It acts yet does not rely—
*Cushion*: Virtue’s nurturing does not see things as something to be acted upon. It does not rely on its function, concluding the meaning of virtue nurturing above.
*Explanation*: Virtue nurtures things, yet does not pride itself in its deeds, while things receive the Dao’s power, and the Dao does not depend on its own possession.

**Long yet not sovereign.**
*Cushion*: With Dao and virtue forgetting the function of generation and nurturing, though it stands as the longest and most mature, it does not act as sovereign or demand repayment from things. This is said to urge rulers to model themselves on the Dao’s generative nurturing while forgetting its function.
*Explanation*: The Dao generates things yet does not claim possession, virtue nurtures yet does not claim achievement. Dao and virtue, though supreme over things, do not rule as sovereigns. Thus, they are eternally honored by all things. A ruler who transforms and nurtures all things without boasting of his ability, extending benevolence to the four seas without seeking reward, and spreading grace universally without pride—letting virtue belong to Heaven and yielding function to things—his heart detached from the nine palaces, not considering high rank as noble, thus preserves his state and enjoys endless blessings. This is called **Mysterious Virtue**.

*Annotation*: As elaborated in the chapter on *Nurturing the Vital Essence*.

*Cushion*: This praises the virtue of forgetting merit. **Mysterious** refers to virtue profound and unfathomable. Though the Great Dao can generate and nurture, it never relies or rules. Its virtue spreads universally yet leaves no trace—is this not the profound and unfathomable virtue?
*Explanation*: The function of Dao and virtue, neither relying nor ruling, is indeed profound and mysterious. The sage’s virtue, neither boasting nor prideful, is indeed vast and great. Dao and virtue, profound and deep, are thus eternally honored by all things. The sage’s deeds, vast and enduring, can indeed achieve eternal tranquility. Those who cultivate the Dao accumulate virtue without claiming it, perform hidden deeds without relying on them, and thus enjoy longevity and may attain the Dao, verifying its truth.

**Chapter 52: The World Has a Beginning**

*Cushion*: The previous chapter expounds how the Dao generates and nurtures without ruling, possessing natural nobility. This chapter explains guarding the mother to preserve the child, returning to the bright to avoid bodily harm. The first seven sentences establish the principle of generation, urging one to guard the mother and preserve the child. The next six sentences demonstrate the prohibition of desire, opening and closing the analogy. The last six sentences praise the merit of cultivation and verification, concluding with the practice of perpetuation.

*Explanation*: Since the Dao’s transformation is manifest, the world has a beginning. The Dao is the mother of all things, containing and nurturing all life. Rulers governing by the Dao and those cultivating it, seeing the completeness of all existence and knowing the origin of the wondrous source, if they abide by the Dao and act through it, their states will be secure and their lives long. The essence of guarding the Dao lies in withdrawing the senses, closing the eyes, sealing the mouth, and quieting the body—observing subtleties, embracing softness, concealing brilliance, and reflecting inward—constantly adhering to this, one may ascend to the ultimate Dao. If one flaunts wisdom or boasts of merit, the Dao recedes. This is its intent.

The world has a beginning, and it is the mother of the world.
*Annotation*: **Beginning** refers to the primal *qi*. It says this primal *qi* generates and nurtures all things, possessing the virtue of abundant nourishment, and thus can be the mother of the world.

*Cushion*: **Beginning** refers to the resource of *qi*, **mother** to the resource of life. It says the Dao, with its pure and harmonious *qi*, generates all things. Things receive life as a mother gives birth to her child, hence it is called the mother of the world. Though **beginning** and **mother** differ from the Dao’s *qi*, their transformations are always unified. Hence, the *Classic* says: *"The unnamed is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; the named is the mother of all things."* This is said to make people know their source and origin, guarding the mother to preserve the child.

*Explanation*: **Resource** means to receive. Things receive life from the Dao; the Dao is their origin. They acknowledge the nurturing virtue, like a mother’s tenderness, and must perceive the flow to recognize the source, discern softness to know the root. Abiding by and guarding the Dao, governing states and people, one may attain enduring peace.

**Beginning** is the center. *"The unnamed is the beginning of Heaven and Earth"*—these are the words of the first chapter. Having obtained the mother, one knows the child.

*Annotation*: Since all things receive the nurturing of the primal *qi*, one knows that their bodies are the children of this *qi*.

*Cushion*: It says that since people receive the nurturing of the pure and harmonious *qi* as their mother, they should know that their bodies are the children of this *qi*.

*Explanation*: The Dao is the mother of the body, possessing the virtue of generation and nurturing. The body is the child of the Dao, recognizing the origin of nurturing and generation, able to embody the Dao’s harmony within, thus preserving itself.

Having known the child, one must again guard the mother, and thus the body will not perish.
*Annotation*: Having known that the body is the child of the primal *qi*, one must guard this pure and harmonious *qi*, preventing its dispersion, so that even at death, the body remains unharmed.

*Cushion*: It says that since people know their bodies are the children of the Dao’s *qi*, born from it, they must constantly guard the Dao’s purity, free from defilement, cherishing *qi* and nurturing spirit, ensuring it does not disperse. People are born from the Dao; they rely on the Dao as their foundation. Now, returning to guard the Dao as the mother, hence it says *"again guard."*

The body will not perish—it means that if one constantly returns to the Dao without desire, one may complete one’s natural lifespan without harm.

*Explanation*: Having known what one has received—the Dao generates my body—I purify the heart and return the spirit, again guarding the Dao, free from confusion of right and wrong, severing the dust of sounds and profits, and practicing this throughout life, the Dao may be attained.

**Close the receptive**, shut the gate, and labor not a lifetime.
*Annotation*: **Receptive** refers to delight. The eyes delight in colors, the ears in sounds; each of the six senses has its delight, and indulgence brings calamity. Hence, block them. If the six senses’ delights are not indulged, the gate of calamity is closed, and thus one labors not a lifetime.

*Cushion*: This clarifies the practice of guarding the mother by severing desire. **Receptive** means delight. It refers to the ears and eyes delighting in sounds and colors, the nose and mouth in fragrances and flavors—each sense has its delight. **Gate** refers to the passage of entry and exit; it is through the senses that external stimuli enter. If one blocks the delight of seeing and hearing, the gate of calamity is closed. With the gate of calamity closed, one labors not a lifetime.

The **Commentary** states:
Only when the **Dao** gathers in emptiness, only when the spirit gathers in nothingness, does one extinguish the heart and annihilate wisdom—then the **Dao** returns to its own. To see without seeing, one aligns with Heaven’s clarity; to hear without hearing, one aligns with Heaven’s acuteness; to act without doing, one aligns with Heaven’s efficacy. When the six roots are unstained, one’s conduct harmonizes with the Mysterious; when the six desires do not arise, one aligns with the **Dao**. The body is at ease, affairs proceed smoothly, and thus one labors not a lifetime.

The *Book of Changes* says: *"Fu [receptive] speaks of delight."* It also takes *fu* as the eyes and *men* (gate) as the mouth, warning against closing and severing the path of calamity. The *Western Ascension Scripture* states: *"The nose and mouth indulging in fragrances and flavors is the origin of resentment."*

This speaks of how the six emotions and desires mutually provoke action—when the eyes see and the ears hear, the heart moves. Once the heart takes delight, the mouth speaks, and the mouth is the gate of calamity. The heart is the master of love and delight, so it can be blocked and closed.

If this calamity is applied to the state, governance becomes chaotic; if practiced in the self, the **Dao** is diminished. When closure is appropriately applied, both body and state are governed in harmony. To open *fu* (delight) and advance affairs is to invite lifelong ruin.

**Commentary:** Opening the six roots, indulging in sight and sound to fulfill delightful pursuits, ensures constant calamity—thus, one is never saved.

**Exegesis:** This clarifies the conduct of losing the **Dao**. Opening the gates of sight and sound to advance delightful affairs only increases calamity and disaster. Thus, one can never rectify matters in a lifetime.

The **Commentary** states:
The **Dao** does not desire busyness—forced vision dims the eyes;
The **Dao** does not desire contrivance—forced hearing dulls the ears.
When the heart and wisdom vie in agitation, the **Dao** cannot be retained.
Indulging in sounds and colors, craving profit and delighting in fame—
ten thousand worries arise, and countless calamities emerge.
Every action invites regret and loss; every inaction invites disaster and obscurity.
Even the divine and transformative cannot aid or generate life—
for one has indulged desire to harm the self.
Thus, one can never be saved in a lifetime.

To see the small is to be clear.
**Commentary:** If one can perceive and correct even the minutest affairs, this is clarity.

**Exegesis:** This demonstrates the source of preventing calamity.
When ominous signs are about to arise, one must detect even the slightest omens.
Thus, moments of worry, regret, and loss depend on the most subtle details—
so those who guard the mother must prevent the sprouting of evil and halt its gradual growth before disorder arises.
Those who act thus may be called clear.

The **Commentary** states:
Those who guard the **Dao** and govern the state must prevent evil before its signs appear and anticipate calamity before its roots take hold.
Close the gate of flattery and deceit, promote the virtuous and capable,
seal the key of craving and desire, and daily refine simplicity.
Worry, regret, and loss—
the *Book of Changes*’s *Xici* says:
*"Discerning auspicious and inauspicious lies in words;
worry, regret, and loss lie in the most subtle details."*
This means that even the slightest omens of auspiciousness, inauspiciousness, regret, and loss must not be overlooked.
*Prevention* is foresight; *halt* means closure.
*Sprouting* refers to the earliest signs, while *gradual* refers to the slow growth from small to great.
To govern before disorder arises—
this is the language of the sixty-third chapter of this scripture.
The *Book of Documents* says:
*"Achieve governance before disorder arises, preserve the state before danger looms—
both are about preventing the sprouting of evil."*
For sprouting, like the cracking of plant stems, first appears as a bud;
gradual growth—whether good or evil—does not happen in a single day or night,
but unfolds through its own progression.
Thus, one must halt and block it before it spreads,
lest it become unmanageable.

To guard softness is to be strong.
**Commentary:** To guard weakness and meekness is to be beyond others’ reach—this is strength.

**Exegesis:** Those who practice guarding weakness and meekness dwell in uncontentious places, beyond others’ interference, aligning with the **Dao**’s use. Those who act thus may be called strong.

The **Commentary** states:
Strength in force invites others to break it;
strength in cunning invites others to harm it;
strength in power invites others to plot against it;
strength in vigor invites others to control it;
strength in virtue invites others to submit to it.
To guard weakness and softness, to avoid clashing with things—
such is virtue, and this may be called strength.
Who would dare harm the **Dao** in its application?

To employ its luminosity and return to its clarity.
**Commentary:** Seeing the small is clarity; guarding softness is strength.
If one boasts of clarity and uses strength, one loses the meaning of guarding softness and seeing the small.
Thus, one must first employ external luminosity, then return to internal clarity—
only then will one forever be free of calamity.

**Exegesis:** Luminosity is external illumination, ever active;
clarity is internal illumination, ever still.
From seeing the small and guarding softness comes clarity and strength—
not boasting of clarity or using strength.
Thus, even if one first employs external luminosity and then returns to internal clarity,
this is a further elucidation of seeing the small and guarding softness,
making one rest externally and return internally—
hence, *"return to its clarity."*

The **Commentary** states:
External clarity has limits—
beyond five *li*, one cannot distinguish cattle and horses.
Internal clarity is boundless—
when the mind illuminates in depth, near and far are all discerned.
Thus, externally, one is ensnared by myriad phenomena, exhausting the spirit and harming nature;
internally, one attains profound stillness and returns to the root.
To restore internal clarity is nearly to attain the **Dao**.
To leave no harm upon the self is called *clinging to the constant*.

**Commentary:** *Heredity* means "to give."
To restore internal clarity means to leave nothing to harm or blame the self.
Thus, this is the practice of secretly employing the true and constant **Dao**.

**Exegesis:** *Heredity* means "to give"; *harm* means "blame."
To employ luminosity to illuminate objects without attachment,
then return to internal clarity without self-aggrandizement,
to guard the mother and preserve the child,
and to reflect upon the source—
this is to have no blame.
This is called *clinging to the constant*—
secretly employing the **Dao** of the true and eternal.
Those who act thus are said to know the child and guard the mother,
secretly employing the true and constant **Dao**.

The **Commentary** states:
Having understood the principle of restoring internal clarity,
thus, no harm or blame touches the self.
When harm and blame do not intrude, the true and constant is secretly fulfilled.
If governing the state relies on boasting of external luminosity,
scrutinizing and censuring minutely,
governance becomes ever more burdensome, and people grow ever more disordered.

「Yet further, one who perceives the subtle and prevents calamities,
who humbles oneself and guards gentleness,
who conceals wisdom yet contains brilliance,
and who entrusts the worthy while leaning in repose—
the principles of the Three Five [1] are thus fulfilled.
How distant are they?

**Dao/Way of the *Zhenxing* [2] and *Guangsheng* [3] Commentary**, Volume Thirty-Eight
Attributed to Master Guangcheng of Tang by Du Guangting [4]
Chapter Fifty-Three: *"Make Me Firm and Resolute"*

**Commentary:**
The previous chapter expounded on guarding the mother and preserving the child,
thus concluding that returning to clarity without leaving harm to the self is the utmost essence.
This chapter reveals that firmness and resoluteness, when applied with knowledge, will follow the Dao/Way,
yet their very application brings fear.

The first three sentences show that knowledge, when applied, diverges from the Dao/Way.
The next two sentences contrast the Dao’s rectitude with human perversity,
while the following seven sentences illustrate the flaws that arise from knowledge.
The final two sentences lament the theft and ostentation of the Dao/Way,
using them as a warning for you.

**Meaning:**
The previous section emphasized returning to clarity and clinging to the constant as the supreme practice.
Now, when one applies knowledge to follow the Dao/Way,
the fear of what one does brings injury,
while the great Dao remains broad and smooth,
and people incline toward wicked paths.
Though palaces are adorned with splendid attire,
and fields lie fallow with neglected cultivation,
those in high positions glut themselves on food and wealth,
while those below suffer empty households and exhausted strength.

If this is the principle, then it is called theft and ostentation—
to repel such licentious excess,
to regulate ceremonial attire and music,
to diligently cultivate the Three Fields [5],
to ensure the abundance of the Ten Thousand Wells [6] is sustained,
then the realm may endure lasting peace,
and people will not turn to theft.

For those who cultivate the self,
they must restrain themselves,
suppress desires, and attend to the Dao/Way.
With frugality and firmness,
one may await the moment of soaring flight.

If one makes me firm and resolute with knowledge,
and follows the great Dao/Way—
**Annotation:** The *Laozi* [7] says:
*"If one makes me firm and resolute in my knowledge,
wishing to follow the great Dao/Way—
since knowledge does not align with the Dao/Way,
only what one does can be feared."*

**Commentary:**
*"Make me"* is a hypothetical phrase used by the *Laozi*.
*"Firm and resolute"* describes the appearance of one who is resolute yet knows.
The Dao/Way is not a matter of knowing laws,
but those who would substitute knowledge for following the Dao/Way.
Thus, the *Laozi* fears their ignorance and boldly declares:
*"If one makes me firm and resolute in my knowledge,
and wishes to follow the effortless Dao/Way in the world—
knowledge will diverge from the Dao/Way,
and one will lose the transformation of effortless clarity and quietude.
Only what one does will bring harm to things.
Hence, it is something to be feared."*

**Meaning:**
The supreme Dao/Way and its adherents,
those who diligently practice it,
do not rely on vast knowledge to follow the Dao/Way,
nor on broad learning to seek the true.

The Dao/Way cannot be known—
the more one knows, the farther one strays.

The *Zhuangzi* ["Lost in the Northern Wilderness" chapter] states:
*"Zhi wandered upon the Mysterious Waters [8] and asked the Master of Effortlessness [9]:
'What thoughts and considerations lead to knowing the Dao/Way?
What dwelling and attire bring peace to the Dao/Way?
What path and method yield the Dao/Way?'
He asked three times and received no answer—not that he did not answer,
but that he did not know how to answer.
Zhi returned to the southern bank of the White Waters,
and asked the Madman Qiu.
The Madman Qiu said: 'Ah, I know it!'
Yet when he tried to speak, he forgot what he intended to say.
Zhi again returned to the Yellow Emperor’s court
and asked the Yellow Emperor.
The Yellow Emperor said:
'When there are no thoughts and no considerations, one begins to know the Dao/Way.
When there is no dwelling and no attire, one begins to find peace in the Dao/Way.
When there is no path and no method, one begins to attain the Dao/Way.'
Zhi said to the Yellow Emperor:
'I and you know it,
but the Master of Effortlessness and the Madman Qiu do not.'
Which of them is correct?
The Yellow Emperor said:
The Master of Effortlessness is truly correct.
The Madman Qiu is merely similar.
I and you are forever distant from it.
The knower does not speak,
the speaker does not know.
Thus, the sage practices the teaching of unsaid words.
This is why the Dao/Way departs from what can be spoken,
and those who know it stray far from the Dao/Way.
This passage urges emperors and kings to practice the teaching of unsaid words,
not to be resolute yet knowing."*

Again, Tai Qing asked the Boundless:
"Do you know the Dao/Way?"
The Boundless replied: "I do not know."
Tai Qing then asked the Master of Effortlessness,
who replied: "I know it."

The Dao/Way can be held in high regard or low,
can be constrained or dispersed.
Tai Qing used these words to question the Boundless Beginning:
*"The Boundless and the Master of Effortlessness—
which of them is correct?"
The Boundless Beginning said:
"The depth of not knowing is profound,
the shallowness of knowing is superficial.
Not knowing is inward,
knowing is outward.
The Dao/Way cannot be heard—
hearing it is false.
The Dao/Way cannot be seen—
seeing it is false.
The Dao/Way cannot be spoken—
speaking of it is false.
If one is resolute yet knowing,
and wishes to follow the Dao/Way,
having already diverged from it,
how can one avoid fear?
The great Dao is broad and smooth,
yet people love shortcuts."*

**Annotation:** The great Dao is plain and easy,
which is why one fears the resolute yet knowing.
Yet people are prone to disorder,
and their desires seek expedience—
like travelers who prefer crooked paths.

**Commentary:**
*"Smooth"* means plain.
*"Shortcuts"* are the crooked, expedient paths.
The text states that the great Dao is broad and smooth,
while people prefer crooked shortcuts.

Moreover, the transformation of the great Dao
values effortlessness.
Effortlessness is plain and easy,
but those who substitute actions cannot suppress their knowledge in desirelessness,
and will exhaust their minds in responding to affairs.
At first, they may prefer shortcuts for speed,
but in the end, they will lose the Dao and burn their harmony.

Hence, it is said: *"People love shortcuts."*

**Meaning:**
The Dao is inherently broad and smooth—
effortlessness is all that is needed to attain it.
Yet people love crooked shortcuts,
and the more they tread upon them, the more they stray from truth.
Crooked and expedient paths attract many followers,
while broad and smooth ways are cherished by few.
Why is this so?
Crooked teachings conform to popular tastes,
and easily lead the common people astray.
The great Dao is serene and unadorned—
only the wise find it difficult to uphold.
Thus, those who create crooked shortcuts are many.

Confucius had a disciple named Tan Tai Mieming [10], also called Ziyu,
who lived in Wucheng.
He walked without taking shortcuts,
found contentment in the Dao and peace in poverty,
and was highly regarded in the Confucian tradition.
How much worse is it for those who pursue the true Dao
yet drown in crooked shortcuts!

For those who govern the state,
the key lies in removing deceit and wickedness,
upholding uprightness,
advancing loyal and sincere ministers,
and banishing flatterers.
Only then can the supreme principle be realized,
and lasting peace be achieved.

*"Burning harmony"* is from the *Zhuangzi* ["External Things" chapter],
which states:
*"When yin and yang lose their proper order,
the heavens and earth are greatly alarmed."*

The water holds fire,
and it burns the great huai tree.
Where benefit and harm clash,
fire is generated in abundance—
the multitude burns in harmony.

Words of harm arise from desire,
for desire’s fire consumes true nature
and wounds the Heavenly Harmony.

*"Extreme governance"*:
**Annotation:** Favoring the wise and valuing cleverness breeds deceitful artifice.
**Explanation:** *Governance* is principle.
**Commentary:** Those who love shortcuts do not uphold the Way of *wuwei*,
but instead take *youwei* as principle.
Though called *"extreme governance,"*
*youwei* fosters cunning and deceit—
hence the annotation: *"Favoring the wise and valuing cleverness breeds deceitful artifice."*
Another interpretation:
The court undertakes grand repairs—
towering halls and ornate walls—
hence *"extreme governance."*

**Meaning:**
When the ruler advances clever and wise men,
exalts courtly order,
then exhausts the people’s strength,
and builds extravagant palaces—
cleverness in governance may make the court stern,
yet the common folk suffer exhaustion.
Extravagance blinds the ruler to true prosperity,
while the people scatter in despair.
How much better than thatched roofs and simple beams,
where governance is achieved with humility!

Those who cultivate the self
wear coarse robes yet treasure inner virtue,
never indulging in excess to harm their conduct.

*"Towering halls and ornate walls"*—
this phrase is from *The Book of Documents* ["Song of the Five Sons"],
when Tai Kang, son of Xia Shao, ascended the throne,
indulging in revelry, his five brothers composed a song:
*"Outside, wild beasts ravage;
within, licentiousness spreads.
Drunk on wine, lost in music,
towering halls and ornate walls.
One of these, and ruin is certain."*

*"Towering halls"*—palaces lofty in height.
*"Ornate walls"*—elaborately decorated ramparts.

*"Fields lie fallow"*:
**Annotation:** Indulging in frivolous pleasures and neglecting labor.
**Commentary:** *"Grass overgrown"* is called *"fallow."*
When luxury and deceit prevail,
agriculture decays.
Having abandoned the rewards of virtuous cultivation,
how can one expect harvests like piled earthen mounds?

**Meaning:**
Wisdom and cleverness in court,
wicked flatterers in power,
prioritizing superficial splendor—
labor is abandoned, agriculture neglected.
Fields overgrown with weeds,
people’s strength drained—
how then achieve the people’s contentment and the state’s dominance?

*The Classic of Poetry* says:
*"Neither plowing nor harvesting—
how then gather three hundred measures of grain?"*

If scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants
each attend to their proper callings,
then there will be none who idle in frivolity or depend on others.

When agriculture is neglected and deceit is honored,
those who live off others multiply—
the state’s strength is exhausted.

*"Like piled earth"*—*huai* means *"mound,"*
speaking of harvests stored like great mounds—
abundance. *"Great"* means vast.
*"Granaries are empty."* **Annotation:**

「The southern fields yield no harvest,
there is no stored abundance.
**Commentary:** The year’s bounty fills the granaries,
but neglect of agriculture leaves them empty—
a natural law.

**Meaning:** When evil is indulged and cleverness is trusted,
government is harmed and farmers are injured.
The idle and frivolous grow many,
yet granaries remain barren.
This is indeed the natural order.

To make the ruler revere simplicity and the minister cherish uprightness,
to block the paths of deceit and open the gates to the virtuous,
to abandon ornate words and lofty platforms,
to cut off frivolous idleness and parasitic consumption,
to encourage farming will fill the granaries,
and to govern with moderation will bring the people peace.

As for refining one’s essence through ritual purity,
and cleansing the mind to uphold the Dao—
how can these not be the way
for both self and state?

**Wearing elaborate embroidery.**
**Commentary:** Engraving and embroidery harm artisans while benefiting the wealthy.
**Commentary:** Green and red as patterns, colored silks as ornament—
this speaks of valuing form over substance.

**Meaning:** The court, having abandoned governance,
the ruler admiring superficial splendor—
when embroidered adornments prevail,
there is no true harmony in affairs.

**Wielding sharp blades.**
**Commentary:** When virtue is not cultivated but martial preparedness is honored.
**Commentary:** Sharp blades are martial preparedness.
Virtue is the instrument for governing the state,
while military strength is its auxiliary.
Virtue is the foundation, martial skill the secondary.
To focus solely on military strength
is to abandon the foundation while elevating the secondary.

**Meaning:** The use of sharp blades
is first for subduing enemies,
not for governing the state’s great affairs.
Now to weigh them heavily and bear them,
this is to slight virtue and abandon the foundation.

Martial preparedness—
as recorded in *The Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Ding of Lu, in the summer of the tenth year,
conducted affairs as the acting minister when meeting Duke Jing of Qi at Jia Valley.
He said: *"I have heard that where there are matters of virtue, there must be martial preparedness,
and where there are martial matters, there must be virtue’s support.
When a feudal lord marches beyond his borders,
he must bring his officials and attendants.
I request permission to bring the Left and Right Marshals."*

Duke Ding complied.
For the meeting platform, they set three-tiered earthen steps
to observe proper etiquette in greeting—
bowing and ascending with measured grace.
After the offerings and toasts were complete,
Qi’s envoys, the Lái people, struck their drums and weapons,
seizing Duke Ding in rebellion.
Confucius advanced halfway up the steps,
then withdrew one level,
and said: *"This is the act of soldiers.
We two rulers have come as friends,
yet a captive from the fringes dares to disrupt us with arms—
this is not how Qi’s ruler commands the feudal lords.
The uncivilized do not conspire against the Xia,
nor barbarians invade the Hua.
Captives do not violate treaties,
nor soldiers threaten alliances.
Before the gods, this is an omen of misfortune;
in virtue, it is a breach of righteousness;
among men, it is a violation of decorum.
The ruler must not allow this."*

Duke Jing of Qi, discomposed, waved his hand and retreated.
After some time, he ordered the music of his court performed,
and jesters and dwarves entertained before him.
Confucius hurried forward,
ascending halfway up the steps,
then stopping one level short.
He said: *"To strike and mock the feudal lord—
this crime deserves execution.
I command the officials to swiftly apply the law."*

Thus, the dwarves were beheaded,
their limbs scattered in different places.
Duke Jing, fearful and ashamed,
after the treaty, returned home
and rebuked his ministers:
*"Ru uses the Way of the virtuous to support its ruler,
yet you alone teach me barbarian ways,
earning offense from Ru’s ruler."*
He then returned the lands he had invaded—
Dān, Quán, and Guīyīn.
This is virtue supported by martial preparedness.

**Sated with food and drink.**
**Commentary:** Savoring rich flavors and fresh delicacies.
Sated means gluttonous.

**Commentary:** The kitchen’s abundance,
gluttony for fragrant freshness—
the ruler lavishes himself with fine provisions,
while the people below suffer from hunger and cold.
**Meaning:** The state relies on deceit,
the ruler admires superficial acts,
the Dao’s transformation fails,
and fields lie fallow.
Yet he delights in rare dishes and fine feasts,
while the people toil with hunger’s sorrow.
The markets overflow with delicacies,
yet the common folk face want’s cruel bite.
Is this not painful?
Wealth is plentiful.

**Commentary:** Hoarding and amassing riches beyond measure.
**Commentary:** Wealth refers to money, silks, jewels, and jade.
Excessive storage and heavy taxation—
this is abundance.
But without learning, riches are not truly treasure;
only the desire to accumulate wealth and burden the foolish prevails.

**Meaning:** The ancients said:
*"Better to distribute wealth to the people,
than to hoard it in the granaries."*
Truly spoken!

Confucius said:
*"If the people lack sustenance,
how can the ruler have abundance?"*
This is how the people flourish and the state is at peace.
But if accumulation knows no end,
no matter how vast the valleys and streams,
if the treasury overflows,
the people’s strength will be exhausted.
This is not the Way of the King or the Hegemon.
This is called *robber’s ostentation*—
not the Way, indeed!

**Commentary:** Boasting of one’s cleverness,
yet actions only bring ruin,
conduct akin to theft,
yet still one boasts.
Robber’s ostentation is not the Way—
it only invites lamentation.

**Meaning:** When one does not govern with moral virtue,
but relies on cleverness and deceit for the state,
within the court, luxury and artifice are prized,
while the people below are drained to exhaustion.
The ruler’s private chambers lack even coarse grain,
yet the public granaries overflow with choice meats.
Wealth proliferates,
fields grow wild with brambles,
and yet he extols the good and boasts of ability—
great ostentation indeed.

For those who govern themselves:
Music and color disrupt the mind,
pearls and jade confuse the eyes,
indulgence harms nature,
clever schemes unsettle the foolish.
True *qi* is wasted in the three *tián* (sensual pursuits),
innocent children perish in the six *zàng* (organs),
while the body lingers on residual *qi*,
serving wealth and boasting like a corpse.
This is theft—
far from the Way!

The Sage Laozi warns against this,
using these words to emphasize stern admonition.
To cultivate oneself and govern the state,
one may take this as a solemn lesson.»

「Thus, the thief—
*The Shuo Wen* says: "One who takes private profit from others is called a thief, with the radical *次* (mouth) and *皿* (vessel)."
The mouth’s saliva rests upon the vessel,
desiring to take its contents,
hence it is called a thief.

*The Zi Lin* says: "To take what does not belong to oneself is called theft."
It speaks of feasting on rare delicacies,
abundant wealth and surfeit,
yet failing to cultivate one’s own virtue.

Wealth is plentiful, yet virtue is thin,
usurping without distinction—
no self-examination, only further boasting.
If not theft, then what?

How much more fitting it is to practice humility and restraint!

**Chapter 54: The Unshaken Foundation of Benevolence**

**Commentary:**
The previous chapter exposed the ruler who, like a thief, boasts and yet lacks the Dao.
This chapter reveals the ruler who establishes benevolence—
one who enjoys unshaken prosperity and enduring legacy.

First, it declares the benefit of establishing a state with the Dao and cultivating oneself.
Next, it illustrates the principle of observing oneself and one’s household.
Finally, it concludes with a sigh of gratitude,
affirming the blessings bestowed upon those who know.

**Meaning:**
To establish a state with virtue and the Dao,
the state cannot be overthrown.
To lead the people with virtue and the Dao,
they will not abandon you.
Thus, one enjoys an endless state,
and one’s descendants will never cease.

What is the method?
Cultivate the Dao in oneself to rectify one’s household,
rectify the household to govern one’s village,
govern the village to order the state,
order the state to harmonize the world.
By observing the benefits of cultivating the Dao,
and the harm of not cultivating it,
the principles of chaos and order become clear,
and the signs of survival and ruin are evident.

Its purpose lies in ceasing the acts of theft and boasting,
and in repenting the desire for shortcuts.
For the state and for oneself,
these are omens of fortune and misfortune.

The well-founded ruler is unshaken.
**Annotation:**
The ruler who skillfully establishes a state with the Dao,
and roots it firmly—
cannot be toppled or overthrown.

**Commentary:**
*Foundation* means to establish.
*Unshaken* means not toppled or overthrown.
The ruler who establishes a state with the Dao,
following the people’s ways,
trusting the natural inclination of the masses,
then refining them with sincerity,
and setting the example with conduct—
when rituals and punishments inspire faith,
and governance is joyfully embraced without exhaustion,
his achievements will be deeply rooted,
all under heaven will turn to his virtue.
This is what is meant by the well-founded ruler—
how can he be toppled or overthrown?

**Meaning:**
To establish a state without the Dao,
leads to the people’s rebellion and the ruler’s isolation.
To establish oneself without the Dao,
invites peril and disaster—
failure follows swiftly,
and ruin is inevitable.
Only virtue and the Dao can serve as a stable foundation,
preventing all danger and calamity.

*When rituals and punishments inspire faith* is as the *Ode to the Great* [Yah] says:
*"The rituals and punishments of King Wen,
all under heaven took as trustworthy."*
*Trustworthy* means faith.
King Wen established the Dao,
and all under heaven turned to it in faith.

*Governance is joyfully embraced without exhaustion*—
these are the words of the sixty-fourth chapter of this text.
The Sage desires to lead others,
yet speaks humbly of his own words.
He wishes to go before others,
yet places himself behind them in action.
In high position, yet the people do not resent him,
in the forefront, yet the people are not harmed by him.
All under heaven willingly embrace his governance,
and it is never exhausted,
for he does not vie or contend,
and thus none under heaven can vie with him.
This is the essence of the well-founded ruler’s conduct.

*Conduct* refers to the moral influence of virtue.
The well-embraced ruler is not abandoned.
**Annotation:**
The ruler who skillfully embraces the people with the Dao,
cannot be abandoned or separated from them.

**Commentary:**
*Embrace* means to guard.
*Abandoned* means to depart.
The ruler who embraces the people with the Dao,
moves and they follow with delight—
how can they be abandoned?

Moreover, where music and feasts are offered,
even passing travelers will linger.
How much more so when virtue and the Dao are present?
To govern with them,
the people will naturally turn to you—
this is their rightful course.

**Meaning:**
The Sage rides with the times to establish the ultimate,
taking the people’s nature as his heart.
All under heaven return to his benevolence,
all regions follow his transformation.
The foundation of the state cannot be toppled or overthrown,
the hearts of the people cannot be abandoned or separated.

In ancient times, King Zhou of the Xia Dynasty,
inheriting the virtue of his ancestor, the Great Yu,
first ruled in the region of Yi.
Pressured by the dog-like Rong tribes,
the Di people attacked him.
He offered them silk and hemp,
but they refused.
He offered them chariots and horses,
but they refused.
He offered them pearls and jade,
but they refused.

He said: *"The Di people seek what they desire—
they covet my lands.
How can I defend them with labor,
and wage war to exhaust the people,
while preserving my own life?
To dwell with someone as a brother,
yet slay his sibling,
to dwell with someone as a father,
yet slay his child—
I cannot bear this.
My subjects are already striving to reside here.
What difference is there between my ministers and theirs?"*

Moreover, I have heard this:
*"Do not harm those you nourish with what you use to nourish them."*
When he took up his staff and left,
the people followed in a connected stream,
and he established his state beneath the Qi Mountains.
He had three sons,
and his youngest, Ji Li, gave birth to King Wen.
King Wen became the Western Earl,
and by disciplining himself and cultivating virtue,
he flourished the Zhou Dynasty for over eight hundred years.
This was indeed a ruler who well-attained the people’s hearts—
how could they abandon and depart from him?

*Where music and feasts are offered*—
these are the words of the thirty-fifth chapter of this text.
It says: *"Music and feasts,
passing travelers will stop."*
When the sounds of music and the display of feasts are heard,
passing travelers will pause to listen,
see them and find them pleasing,
and thus remain.

How much more so when virtue and the Dao are clearly manifested—
the people will naturally delight in and follow them.

Descendants sacrifice to their ancestors without ceasing.
**Annotation:**
The ruler who establishes and embraces the people with virtue and the Dao,
extends his blessings to posterity,
and cherishes the sweet osmanthus groves—
how much more so for his descendants?

For the kings of Zhou,
their ancestral temples were fortified,
and their ancestral virtues were revered,
thus the rise of Zhou began with Hou Ji,
and was completed by King Wen and King Wu.
When Zhou offered sacrifices,
they made offerings to Hou Ji at the outskirts,
and to King Wen in the ancestral temples,
so even though there were thirty generations of divination for succession,
and seven hundred years of divination for longevity,
the ruins of the ancestral temples overflowed—
yet the sacrifices to Hou Ji and King Wen,
the offerings at the outskirts and ancestral temples,
were never discontinued.

**Commentary:**
*Sacrifice* means to offer.
*Successive generations* are called *sacrifice*.
It refers to descendants offering sacrifices to their ancestors.
*Discontinued* means to cease.

**Meaning:**
To govern the state by establishing benevolence and embracing virtue,
one’s blessings will flow to descendants.
To cultivate oneself by establishing benevolence and embracing virtue,
one’s years will extend beyond natural limits,
sacrifices will never cease,
and one’s lineage will endure without end.

The love for the sweet osmanthus tree is sung in the *Ode of Sweet Osmanthus*:
*"Its branches shelter the sweet osmanthus,
Do not prune it, do not harm it—
Here Chào Bó rested."*

In ancient times, when King Wu of Zhou held sway over all under Heaven,
he appointed Duke Zhou Dan to govern the eastern bank of the Shàn River,
and Chào Gong Shì to govern the western bank.
Chào Gong possessed virtue, and the people rejoiced in his governance.
He never wished to weary the people’s strength,
so he sat beneath the sweet osmanthus tree to hear disputes.
Later generations cherished his virtue and preserved the tree,
neither cutting nor felling it—
and the *Ode* praised it for its beauty.

Ancestors who earned merit:
When emperors and kings established their states,
they relied upon the accumulated blessings of generations past to attain rule.
Once their achievements were complete and rites established,
they rooted their sacrifices in their ancestors who had earned merit,
honoring those who possessed virtue.
*宗 (Zōng)* means to honor.

Hòu Jì, of the Jī lineage, was named Qì.
He served as an official under Emperor Yáo,
and continued under Shùn.
When the common people suffered from famine,
Hòu Jì scattered and planted the hundred grains
to relieve the people.
His achievements surpassed those of others,
and he became the agricultural overseer.
His descendants, including Dàn Fù, down to King Wén and King Wŭ,
established the ancestral altars of soil and grain.
Thus, their ancestral temple honored Hòu Jì as a match to Heaven,
and sacrificed to King Wén as a match to Earth.
Though the direct descendants perished in the ancestral temple,
the temples of Hòu Jì and King Wén—
the founding ancestors—
were worshipped generation after generation.
It was only with the Qin-Han revolution that sacrifices ceased.

The Hàn dynasty succeeded the Yáo lineage,
and Emperor Shàng of the Táng possessed saintly virtue,
whose blessings extended to the people.
His descendants thus founded the Hàn dynasty,
continuing the ancestral sacrifices of the generations.
When the Wèi dynasty received the imperial mandate from the Hàn,
sacrifices again ceased.

Emperor Dé Míng, Gāoyáo,
assisted Yáo in serving Shùn,
and cultivated virtue among the people.
Thus, our Táng dynasty inherited his distant blessings,
received the Mandate of Heaven, and ruled the realm.
We posthumously honored him as Emperor Dé Míng.

**Cultivating the self, its virtue becomes true.**
*Annotation:* Cultivating the Dao in the self, virtue becomes pure and genuine.
*Commentary:* Here it clarifies that little cultivation yields little evidence,
and much learning yields much attainment.
Thus, *cultivating the self* means cultivating one’s own person,
*cultivating the family* means cultivating one’s household.
Beginning with the self, extending to the world—
the pattern is clear.
It speaks of those who establish benevolence,
who perceive true nature—
pure and unadulterated, free of all falseness.
Once all falseness is exhausted,
virtue becomes truly pure.

**Meaning:**
A journey of a thousand *lǐ* begins with a single step.
To govern the self and the state,
one must first attend to oneself, then to others.
Thus, near cultivation begins with the self,
while far-reaching influence extends to all things.
Establishing roots and securing foundations,
one remains unshaken and undisturbed.
When the self’s virtue is pure and genuine,
all things respond and transform of their own accord.

**Cultivating the family, its virtue becomes abundant.**
*Annotation:* When a household is entirely cultivated,
virtue overflows with blessings.
*Commentary:* Cultivating the Dao within the family,
the upper and lower relations are harmonious,
and thus its virtue brings abundant blessings.
Hence the *Yì* says:
*"A household that accumulates goodness
will surely have abundant blessings,
while a household that accumulates evil
will surely have abundant calamities."*

This illustrates that fortune and misfortune arise gradually,
first revealing the good or evil of one’s actions,
and later manifesting in fortune or misfortune.
When a family cultivates the Dao,
goodness will surely overflow.

**Cultivating the neighborhood, its virtue becomes enduring.**
*Annotation:* When an entire neighborhood is cultivated,
virtue endures for long.
*Commentary:* According to the *Zhōu Lǐ*,
a *xiāng* consists of 12,500 households.
When a neighborhood cultivates the Dao,
rites and propriety flourish,
and the hierarchy of elders and juniors is observed.
Neighbors respect one another without favoring kin.
Though cultivating morality in a single family is not yet widespread,
when an entire neighborhood is cultivated,
virtue endures for long.

**Meaning:**
When a gentleman establishes his conduct,
he first rectifies himself, then his family,
then his neighborhood.
He honors the elders, respects the young,
teaches the ignorant, and enlightens the confused.
The young and old are properly guided,
and the hierarchy of elders and juniors is maintained.
The winds of teaching are strict and orderly,
and the music of propriety is harmonious and refined.
From the cultivation of one self,
all households derive their virtue.
The transformative power of the Dao is unmatched in goodness—
thus its blessings are lasting and enduring.

**Cultivating the state, its virtue becomes abundant.**
*Annotation:* When an entire state is cultivated,
virtue becomes plentiful.
*Commentary:* Cultivating the Dao within the state,
customs are transformed and morals refined,
returning to simplicity and rejecting artifice,
without favoring the near at the expense of the distant.
Though cultivating morality in a neighborhood is not yet universal,
when an entire state is cultivated,
virtue becomes abundant and rich.

**Meaning:**
A state refers to the domains of the feudal lords—
the Dukes, Marquises, Earls, Viscounts, and Barons,
each ruling their own territory to defend the royal house
and protect the imperial residence.
If within a state the Dao is cultivated,
rites are practiced and governance refined,
the ruler is trustworthy and ministers loyal,
and the realm knows no anxieties.
Its virtue is abundant and great.

**Cultivating the world, its virtue becomes universal.**
*Annotation:* If all under Heaven cultivates virtue,
its blessings spread everywhere.
*Commentary:* *Universal* means pervasive.
The people’s return to simplicity depends on the ruler’s transformation.
Cultivating the Dao in the ancestral halls,
virtue flows beyond the seas—
for when the self is rectified,
there is no need for speech to transform,
nor for teaching to govern.
The lower responds to the higher,
like echoes answering sounds.
Virtue reaches everywhere,
and thus its blessings are universal.

**Meaning:**
The practice of the Dao begins with the self
and then extends to all things.
Thus it is said:
*"I have never heard of a state in chaos while the self was governed,
nor a state in order while the self was disordered."*
Therefore, when the self is cultivated within,
all things respond without.
Virtue emanates from the near and extends to the far.
Even a single individual’s response is thus—
how much more so for the Son of Heaven?

The Son of Heaven delights in the Dao,
revering Heaven and aligning with Earth,
concentrating his heart in profound stillness,
rectifying his person and taking no action.
The records of the Great Unity are established,
and the four barbarian regions bring tribute and submit.
All under Heaven comes to be ruled by the Kingly Way,
and the Dao pervades everywhere—
thus its virtue is universal and pervasive.

The Hall of State is where the Son of Heaven conducts governance.

*"Virtue universally extended"* is found in the *Yijing*’s *Bucken* (乾) hexagram’s *Xiang* (象):
*"The dragon appears in the fields—virtue universally extended."*

It speaks of the dragon hidden in the initial nine (初九), appearing in the second nine (九二). When hidden, its work is yet incomplete, its virtue not yet reaching all things. It waits for the time to act, remaining still to preserve itself. When it emerges in the second nine, it spreads virtue and transformation, reaching all corners of the world—thus its universal extension.

The dragon symbolizes *yang* qi. When *yang* qi first arises in the first month, it lies hidden in the depths of the dark springs. In the second month, it emerges and can then generate and transform all things. Inspired by its transformative power, it spreads *yang* qi universally across all things.

Thus, when observing the self with the self—
*Note: Observing the self through the method of self-cultivation, the truly pure is cold and clear.*
*Cushion (疏):* "Observing" means illuminating and examining. The note says that observing the self through the method of self-cultivation, the truly pure is clear and undefiled—meaning to perceive the true nature of the self, originally pure, unstained by dust or defilement, free from all false views. Once false views are abandoned, knowing emptiness is also emptiness, casting aside both extremes, directly aligning with the Middle Way. This is truly the cold clarity of authenticity.

*Meaning:* A body unguided by the Dao acts contrary to right principle, inviting disgrace and peril. A body guided by the Dao cuts off all external distractions, harmonizes with the One Qi, removes defilement, stills thought, and concentrates the mind. With wisdom, it observes itself, realizing true reality, neither clinging to emptiness nor existence, entering the subtle gate. Thus, the Dao may be attained.

A ruler who governs by principle holds fast to the Middle—
then he will long enjoy Heaven’s blessings.

When observing the family with the family—
*Note: Observing the family through the method of family cultivation, the harmonious abound.*
*Cushion:* Observing the family through the method of family cultivation, if family members are harmonious, blessings will overflow.

*Meaning:* A family unguided by the Dao lacks filial piety among the six relations, disregards the Five Teachings, and invites calamity. Superiors and inferiors fracture and conflict.

A family guided by the Dao unites the nine clans in harmony, gathering all virtues. The *Yijing*’s *Family* (家人) hexagram’s fifth line *Xiang* says:
*"The king establishes his family—mutual love prevails."*
This speaks of one in high station who understands family principles, where the six relations live in harmony. Applied to governance, it transforms the world, fostering mutual love and joy.

When observing the village with the village—
*Note: Observing the village through the method of village cultivation, the orderly endure.*
*Cushion:* Observing the village through the method of village cultivation, if all villagers cultivate the Dao, superiors and inferiors follow their stations, and the Dao’s transformation spreads, virtue extends its reach.

*Meaning:* A village unguided by the Dao lacks ritual respect, elders and juniors lose order, nobles oppress the lowly, and conflicts erupt between high and low.

A village guided by the Dao, its virtue flourishing, people conform to their roles, serene and content, with a tranquil land and harmonious people.

When observing the state with the state—
*Note: Observing the state through the method of state cultivation, the frugal thrive.*
*Cushion:* Observing the state through the method of state cultivation, if all its people cultivate the Dao, acting with frugality, virtue becomes abundant.

*Meaning:* A state unguided by the Dao wages endless wars, harms its people, and plagues of pestilence spread, inflicting cruel suffering.

A state guided by the Dao receives divine assistance, with timely rains and bountiful harvests. Good transformations take root, auspicious omens appear, and people prosper in virtue and wealth—governance makes this so.

When observing the world with the world—
*Note: Observing the world through the method of world cultivation, the non-acting universal.*
*Cushion:* What more is there to observe when observing the world with the world? Only observe the self. If the sovereign remains pure, still, and non-acting, establishing and embracing goodness through the Dao, the people naturally rally, and the state’s fate becomes secure.

*Meaning:* The unguided world—such as Jie and Zhou—drowns the people in suffering, fractures the seas and lands, turns kin into enemies, and reduces altars to ruins. Though they have cunning ministers and warriors, they cannot be used. Though they have impregnable fortresses, they cannot be defended. Even the life of a noble with ten thousand chariots is not worth that of a lowly commoner.

The guided world—such as Yao and Shun—bestows titles even on commoners, with kindness reaching distant courts, and their calendar standards spread like Yu’s. Though floods or droughts strike, the people suffer no harm. Though armies march, the people harbor no resentment.

The reason for this is as follows: With the ninefold rectification of one’s own person, the world naturally falls into order. Then, one ascends to the True and attests to the Dao, abiding eternally without perishing, and thus becomes a radiant model for all ten thousand generations.

How do I know the world to be thus? By this. *Note:* This is a method of observing oneself and others alike; through observation, one may know it.

The *Daode Jing* Master says: How do I know that the world’s good is like a tree that cannot be uprooted, and its virtue/power is like a babe that cannot be cast aside? It is because, through this method of observing oneself and others alike, one sees that calamities arise from within and spread outward—thus one knows it.

The *Yijing* says, "Observe my life," and again, "Observe their life," meaning one who would observe himself must also observe others.

*Meaning:* The Master’s profound compassion for all beings, earnestly imparting his teachings with tender solicitude, elucidates the distinction between domestic and national order, the root of chaos and tranquility, and the proof of whether virtue/power is cultivated or neglected.

A second self-posed question broadens the path for all who are confused: How does one know the rise and fall of the world? It is by observing through these five methods the verification of good and evil, loss and gain.

The phrase *"Observe my life"* refers to the *Yijing*’s **Guàn** hexagram, line three: *"Observe my life"*—this speaks to the omen of advancement and retreat. My life is the movement of my person. Line three stands at the extreme of the lower trigrams, indicating a time when advancement is possible; yet it is also beneath the upper trigram, placing it in a position where retreat is likewise possible. Though distant and not in contact with things, it is not the lowly position of **tóngguàn** (the youthful observer); though not the apex of the fourth line, it has not yet reached the full radiance of observation.

In the realm, it occupies the ground of advancement and retreat, allowing for self-observation. If advancement is possible, then advance; if retreat is possible, then retreat. Observing the winds and adjusting accordingly, the Dao is not lost. This is the principle of the hexagram’s symbolism: advancement and retreat are thus verified.

As for observing the realm and observing one’s person, the meaning lies in diligently cultivating virtue/power. When virtue/power is cultivated, the realm does not topple or be uprooted, and one attains blessings and the True. When virtue/power is lost, the realm diminishes and its fate is perilous, while misfortune descends upon one’s person in disgrace. How could such a ruler and minister fail to exhort themselves sincerely?

The phrase *"Observe their life"* refers to one who stands at the highest point, elevating his affairs, for life itself is the Dao. He is the model for the world to observe his own Dao, hence the saying *"Observe their life."* How could one who dwells in a place unlike others, and is observed by all, not be cautious? The virtuous man is ever vigilant, thus avoiding blame.

The *Zhèngyì* states: *"My life, their life"*—all are movements arising. This is the meaning of growth. The *Daode Jing*’s *Guāngshèngyì* (Illustrated Explication of Supreme Virtue) concludes its thirty-eighth chapter. The *Daode Jing*’s *Guāngshèngyì* begins its thirty-ninth chapter.

**Tang Guangcheng Master’s *Du Guangting* Explication: *Hándé zhī hòu* (The Depth of Virtue/Power) – Chapter Fifty-Five**

**Commentary:**
The preceding chapter expounds upon the principle of *shànjiàn* (benevolent establishment) and how its master endures without being uprooted, thus achieving eternal preservation. This chapter elucidates how one who *hándé* (embodies virtue/power) alone comprehends *hé* (harmony) without causing *hài* (harm), the first five sentences marking the foundation of *hándé* in avoiding *bó* (confrontation). The next five sentences—*gǔ ruò xià*—demonstrate how complete harmony prevents *jiá* (disruption). To know harmony is to be enlightened; to employ *qi* (vital force) is to become *qiángliáng* (forceful and rigid). Beneath the passage on *zhì* (vigorous), it exhorts those who are *qiángliáng* (forceful and rigid) to refrain from such conduct.

**Meaning:**
When a ruler can establish and nurture benevolence within the state, then for his own person, what is essential is to embody *hándé* (the depth of virtue/power) and achieve complete harmony. Benevolent establishment ensures the state does not lean toward peril; embodying virtue/power ensures no harm befalls beings. Harmony attained brings forth goodness for all; beings grow vigorous, yet this is not the Dao—early extinction awaits them. It is not merely a warning for self-cultivation, but also an exhortation to align with the natural transformations of the cosmos. This is the great intent of this chapter.

The depth of virtue/power is likened to that of a *chìzǐ* (赤子, infant).

**Annotation:**
The *Zhìrén* (至人, Perfect One) who embodies and cherishes the profound depth of Dao/virtue, his conduct is akin to that of an infant.

**Commentary:**
*Hán* (含) means to embrace. The Perfect One embraces and cherishes profound virtue/power, inwardly safeguarded by Dao/virtue and outwardly protected by the divine, as a tender mother guards her infant. This principle is difficult to grasp, hence the analogy is employed to elucidate it. Thus, the infant’s complete harmony is likened to the Perfect One’s complete virtue/power. The *chìzǐ* (赤子) refers to a newborn babe, selected for its inner lack of differentiation—no heart to harm others.

**Meaning:**
The adept of the Supreme Dao conceals virtue/power and embodies harmony, his inner and outer essence blending seamlessly without clashing with beings. His nature is pure, like an infant before its eyes have turned, or a babe yet to speak. His virtue/power being thus, beings cannot harm him. Beings cannot harm him because the Perfect One harbors no heart to harm others.

The *chìzǐ* (赤子) is the infant before its eyes turn—at three months, its gaze shifts, its pupils faintly discerning, and it begins to differentiate people. Before this differentiation, it is called *chìzǐ*, its harmony of *qi* being complete. Once it differentiates, the harmony of *qi* is divided, and it can no longer be called *chìzǐ*.

Poisonous insects do not sting, fierce beasts do not seize, predatory birds do not attack.

**Annotation:**
The Perfect One’s spirit is divine; beings cannot injure him. With no heart to harm others, there is no ground for others to confront or sting him. This is the Perfect One’s embodiment of virtue/power.

**Commentary:**
This elucidates the Perfect One’s complete virtue/power.

The poisonous insects—bees and wasps—do not sting, the fierce beasts—tigers and rhinoceroses—do not seize, and the predatory birds—hawks and falcons—do not clutch.

**Annotation:**
Sting (*chìzǐ*) refers to the venomous tail used to harm. Seize (*jù*) means to press with one’s feet. Clutch (*bó*) means to grasp with one’s claws.

**Commentary:**
This reveals that the Perfect One’s virtue/power is fully contained within. His *qi* is harmonious and abundant, his heart merged in the Dao/Way, so even venomous insects cannot sting him, fierce beasts cannot seize him, and predatory birds cannot clutch him. This is due to his utmost compliance with virtue and profound depth.

The meaning is: The practice of containing virtue blends indistinguishably with the Dao/Way. When he moves, he aligns with nature’s suitability, so beings do not harm him; when he remains still, he unites with the Dao/Way, and harm cannot befall him. Even those like bees and wasps that sting, or fierce beasts that seize and clutch, naturally retreat. How could they harm him?

A ruler who contains virtue and governs with harmony can prevent chaos and war from arising, external threats from invading, and within his realm, all things transform peacefully. This is what is meant by containing virtue.

Before the *chìzǐ* knows the union of male and female, his vitality is at its peak. **Annotation:**
*Tā* (牝) means female, *mā* (牡) means male. *Jùn* (峻) is the source of vital breath and life.

The *chìzǐ*’s heart is free from desire; before he discerns the pairing of yin and yang, the origin of his *qi* moves naturally. Is this not because his essence is pure and unadulterated?

**Commentary:**
The *Shàngqīng Dòngzhēn Pǐn* (上清洞真品) states: "When a person is born, he receives the *qi* of Heaven and Earth as his spirit and form, and the *qi* of the Primordial One as his fluids and essence. When Heaven’s *qi* diminishes, the spirit begins to disperse; when Earth’s *qi* diminishes, the form falls ill; when the Primordial *qi* diminishes, life expires. Thus, the Dao of the Perfect One returns to the Primordial, flowing back to the hundred channels, ascending to replenish the *nǐjiǔ* (泥丘). A solid brain ensures the spirit’s completeness, and a complete spirit ensures the form’s completeness. One whose form is complete has all his gates internally regulated, and malevolent *qi* vanishes externally. His marrow solidifies into bone, his intestines transform into sinew—pure and unmingled—so longevity may be attained."

All day he cries, yet his voice does not grow hoarse. This is the ultimate harmony. **Annotation:**
Although the *chìzǐ*’s bones are weak and sinews soft, he can still clench his fists firmly. Before he knows the union of yin and yang, the source of his *qi* moves naturally—this is the essence of purity. He cries all day, yet his voice does not break or grow harsh, for his harmony is utterly complete.

**Commentary:**
*Gǎ* (嘎) means a voice broken by strain. Though the *chìzǐ* cries incessantly, his voice does not grow hoarse or break—this is the result of his pure and unadulterated essence.

The meaning is: Those who contain virtue and embody perfect harmony have virtue and conduct that are profound and complete. Their essence is pure, their *qi* harmonious, like the *chìzǐ*. When the *chìzǐ*’s harmony is fully accumulated, his Primordial *qi* is internally abundant, his grasp firm, and his cries unbroken—this is the utmost purity.

When crying reaches its limit and no sound is produced, this is called *gǎ*. The *chìzǐ*’s harmony has not yet dispersed, his true essence remains intact. It is likened to a realm governed with perfect purity, where all beings are uncorrupted, the mysterious transformation unfathomable, and his virtue’s resonance ever more brilliant, without exhaustion.

The infant’s bones are weak and sinews supple, yet his grasp is firm—this is not due to strength, but to the infant’s mind being single-minded. Thus, those who embody virtue bend their bodies to follow things, soften their hearts to align with the Dao, and remain untouched by worldly desires, for their mental cultivation is pure and cold.

The infant’s vigor is unchecked yet does not exhaust him, for those who embody virtue act without contrivance, responding naturally to things, untouched by carnal desires, for their bodily conduct is pure. The infant’s cries do not falter, just as those who embody virtue expound the Dharma to benefit others, their teachings resonating endlessly without decay—for their speech is pure. The infant is utterly pure, untouched by external desires, his mind undisturbed, all by nature’s course.

Those who embody virtue cultivate the Threefold Conduct with purity, like the infant. The Way of governing lies in the sovereign embracing sincerity, ministers acting with loyalty, laws unneeded as virtue spreads naturally. Just as the infant is naturally unadorned, so too does one who cultivates virtue daily renew their harmony, their *qi* subtly abundant, and all return to the Dao.

**Knowing harmony is the constant.**
*Annotation:* To steadfastly uphold the infant’s gentle harmony is to practice the Way of the constant.
*Commentary:* The infant’s voice remains unbroken through his pure harmony—thus demonstrating teaching. To act like the infant, understanding harmony and softness, and never straying from it, is to practice the Way of true constancy.
*Meaning:* When the Five Constants are complete, this is harmony. Harmony in the body fills virtue and attains the True; harmony in the realm spreads transformation and ensures enduring blessings. Harmony in assembly aligns with ritual; harmony in war brings victory. Great indeed is the meaning of harmony.

**Knowing the constant is clarity.**
*Annotation:* To guard harmony and know the constant is to be enlightened.
*Commentary:* One who understands the Way of true constancy and preserves their essence while cherishing their *qi* is called one of clear insight and awakening. Knowing harmony and the constant, we marvel at the beauty of shared virtue.

**Excessive striving brings ruin.**
*Annotation:* Ruin is the omen of overreaching.
*Commentary:* Ruin is the sign of good or ill fortune. Unable to fully uphold harmony in knowing the constant, yet seeking gain beyond measure—one who does not realize that overreaching in pursuit of benefit only brings greater loss, this is the omen of ruin.
*Zhuangzi* says: *"The constant follows nature without excessive striving."*

*Meaning:* One who knows harmony and the constant is enlightened in the Dao. Yet if they further overreach in striving, they invite ruin as an omen. Such is the excess of seeking life—it becomes an inauspicious sign.

Those who do not overreach, as *Zhuangzi* says in *"The Chapter on Perfect Virtue"*:
*"This is not what I call ‘emotion.’ What I call ‘without emotion’ is not letting likes and dislikes internally harm the body, but following nature without excessive striving."*

Here, *Zhuangzi* calls right and wrong ‘emotion,’ meaning not letting joy and anger harm one’s nature, nor sorrow and delight injure the spirit. Received by nature, without artificial pursuit, human principles are complete—why add contrivance to seek life? The Dao manifests in its form; Heaven gives its shape—do not let likes and dislikes internally harm the body.

**Forcing *qi* with the mind is tyranny.**
*Annotation:* The mind has right and wrong; *qi* has no discrimination. If one compels the mind to dominate *qi*, this is the tyrant.
*Commentary:* The mind has right and wrong, yet *qi* is undifferentiated. Thus, yielding to *qi* makes one weak, while forcing the mind makes one tyrannical. Those who stray from the Dao and overreach in striving compel the mind to dominate *qi*, letting the mind enslave *qi*—this is tyranny.
Thus *Zhuangzi* says: *"Do not listen with the mind, but listen with *qi*."*

*Meaning:* Those who embody virtue yield to *qi* and are soft; those who overreach force the mind and become tyrannical. Softness aligns with true constancy; tyranny defies cultivation. Governing the realm also prizes softness over strength—abandoning softness for tyranny brings ruin to self and state.

*"Do not listen with the mind"*—as *Zhuangzi* says in *"The Chapter on Humanity in the World"*:
*"If your will is singular, do not listen with the ears but with the mind; do not listen with the mind but with *qi*. Listening stops at the ears; the mind stops at symbols. *Qi* is the empty receptivity to things. Only the Dao gathers the empty—emptiness is heart-fasting. This means when the heart is empty, desires find no entry; when the spirit is clear, mystical insight is flawless. Abandoning form and sound, forgetting scope and wisdom—when scope and wisdom are forgotten, the mysterious Dao arrives; when form and sound are unified, all things dissolve into emptiness. The mind stops at symbols; *qi* merges with the boundless—this is called heart-fasting. Only Confucius’ Yán Huì attained this."*

**When things reach their peak, they decline—this is not the Dao; the Dao declines early.**
*Annotation:* All things, at their peak, grow old—thus the warning: *"Do not boast in strength or rely on might."*
*Meaning:* This reveals the error of tyrannical overreach. The strong are rigid and resolute; the old are weary and exhausted. Things flourish then decline—this is the mysterious correspondence.

*Annotation:* The five lines interpret as in *"The Chapter on the Surging Dao."* There, it speaks of the Dao; here, of humanity.

「When a person can embody the Dao, this is called sharing in its virtue and power with the mysterious correspondence.

*Annotation:* Praising those who embody the Dao, who are neither confined by words nor teachings, nor entangled in worldly distinctions, but instead act in harmony with the Dao—this is the mysterious correspondence.

*Meaning:* Above, it clarifies the four ways of embodying the Dao: when their benefits to humanity are evident, and their governance of self and state fulfills its purpose, this is called sharing in the Dao’s virtue and power.

*Annotation:* "Play" (玄) refers to the Dao.

Thus, it cannot be approached with familiarity,
*Annotation:* The mysterious correspondence holds no private bias, so it cannot be approached with familiarity.
nor can it be distanced with estrangement.
*Annotation:* It blends universally with all, so it cannot be distanced with estrangement.

*Annotation:* The one who embodies the mysterious correspondence has no partiality in heart, so neither intimacy nor distance can be discerned in things.

Following the Dao’s natural flow, one cannot be made noble by rank,
*Annotation:* By embodying the Dao naturally, one is not elevated by titles or wealth.
nor can one be debased by commonality.
*Annotation:* By transcending all attachments, one is not diminished by worldly standards.

*Annotation:* When the heart aligns with the mysterious correspondence, nobility and lowliness are one.

The virtuous embodying the Dao are neither swayed by honors nor deterred by punishments—like jade cast into mud, they remain unstained. How could nobility or lowliness affect their thoughts?

Thus, they are held in highest esteem by all under Heaven.
*Annotation:* By embodying the Dao without obstruction, they attain effortless clarity—all distractions dissolve, and even dust and brilliance become equal. Since they are neither easy to approach nor distant, they are held in highest esteem by all under Heaven.

*Annotation:* The virtuous who embody the mysterious correspondence comprehend truth and forget words, seal their senses and close their gates, untouched by roots and dust. With all sharpness and confusion resolved, even brilliance and filth are equal—such is their conduct, and thus they are revered as the noblest under Heaven.

*Meaning:* Having illuminated the four ways of embodying the Dao, the mysterious correspondence aligns with the Way. The heart does not dwell on intimacy or distance, nor does their conduct mingle with gain or harm. Nobility brings no joy, lowliness no sorrow—they merge seamlessly with the Great Dao and are thus the noblest under Heaven.

If rulers uphold these four virtues to transform the myriad lands, blending with the Dao in unity, then governance is achieved without words.

**Translation:**

*Explication by Master Du Guangting of the Tang Dynasty on the *Daoist Classic of the True Scripture of the Way and Its Virtue/Power*, Chapter 57: *Governance Through Dao*

*Commentary:* The preceding chapter elucidates those who awaken to the Dao, who transcend words yet hold no fixation.

This chapter reveals how rulers who govern through *politics* (事) lose the Dao’s natural self-transformation. The first three lines establish the theme; the next ten pose questions to clarify principles. The final five lines contrast the ease of achieving rule through non-action.

○ *Explication:* To govern through *politics*, one must clearly proclaim its principles. To wage war through stratagem, its deceit is not the Dao.

Better than this is to gather the myriad lands through non-action, yet some rulers multiply prohibitions, expand schemes of governance, indulge in laborious regulations, and clarify laws—thus drifting far from the Dao, and their realm grows ever more perilous.

Only when one governs without action, discards desires, and returns to stillness—when arms are not wielded, stratagems not employed, decrees not burdensome, and punishments scarcely applied—does one grasp this chapter’s profound meaning.

*Governance Through Dao,*
*Commentary:* These next three lines further emphasize the core principle.
*以* (here: *to employ*), *用* (use) also. *政* (here: *teaching*), *教* also. Rulers who rely on active governance and teaching, yet still seek to uphold principles, cannot achieve non-action, nor allow things to transform naturally. To desire such governance while seeking to fulfill principles is unheard of before this time.

*Explication:* Those who govern through the Dao/Way: do not speak, yet the people trust; do not decree, yet the people comply; do not punish, yet the people stand in awe; do not reward, yet the people are inspired.

Why is this so? When the people are transformed by their ruler, all turn toward goodness—no need for rewards to inspire them. When the people are in harmony, they naturally abandon their vices—no need for punishments to instill awe. When they return to simplicity, they naturally follow decrees. When they align in purity and rectitude, they naturally trust without words.

This is governance through non-teaching. To govern through words and teaching, the people are entangled in artificiality—this is not the Dao.

*Waging War Through Stratagem,*
*Commentary:* *奇* (stratagem), deception and trickery. Such instruments are unlucky; the virtuous despise them. How much more so when they are named as stratagems and used without restraint? War is like fire—if not controlled, it will consume itself.

Thus, stratagems and deceitful warfare are not the Dao’s way to conquer.
*Explication:* To wage war through stratagems and deceit is contrary to the Great Dao. How so?

A realm’s foundation lies in governance and law, with governance rooted in simplicity and adherence to natural order. Warfare begins with stratagem, which must adapt to circumstances and align with principle.

When governance strays from the Dao, punishments and rewards become excessive. When deceit strays from the Dao, slaughter and harm abound. To rely on excessive punishments and rewards for victory, or on indiscriminate slaughter to seek triumph, yet still hope to prosper the realm and fulfill principles—is this not difficult?

Compared to allowing things to transform naturally, where even military campaigns are unnecessary—this is far removed.

*Warfare is like fire*—as recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals* (春秋), Year 4 of Duke Huan’s reign (隐公四年), the son of the Duke of Wei, State Brutus (州吁), assassinated his lord, Duke Huan (完).

Initially, Duke Zhuang of Wei (庄公) married a sister of the Duke of Qi’s consort, named Lady Zhuangjiang (庄姜), who was beautiful yet childless. The people of Wei composed the ode *The Stately Lady* (《硕人》) about her. He then married a woman from Chen (陈), named Lady Liwei (厉伪), who bore a son, Lord Xiaobo (孝伯), who died young. His concubine, Lady Dai (戴妫), bore Duke Huan (桓公). Lady Zhuangjiang claimed Duke Huan as her own son. State Brutus (州吁), son of the Duke of Qi’s consort (璧人), was favored and fond of warfare.

The Duke did not restrain him, but Lady Zhuangjiang loathed his ways. Stone Bi (石碏) advised:

*"I have heard that loving one’s child means teaching them with righteous methods, not indulging their wrongs. Arrogance, extravagance, licentiousness, and dissipation—these are the roots of evil. Their emergence stems from excessive favor and wealth. The four vices arise when indulgence surpasses bounds."*

When the Duke intended to establish State Brutus as heir, he made the decision early. If this were not yet settled, it would invite disaster. Indeed, those who are favored yet not arrogant, arrogant yet able to humble themselves, humbled yet without resentment, and resentful yet able to mend their ways—such are rare.

Moreover, when lowly usurp the noble, the young domineer the old, the distant sever the close, the new supplant the old, the small oppress the great, and licentiousness destroys righteousness—these are called the *Six Reversals*. But when the ruler upholds righteousness and the minister acts with integrity, when fathers show benevolence and sons filial piety, when elders love and younger siblings respect—these are the *Six Harmonies*. To abandon harmony and embrace reversal is the path to swift ruin. A ruler who ought to avert calamity instead hastens it—is this not unwise?

The Duke did not heed this counsel. Stone Bi’s son, Hou, consorted with State Brutus, but his father forbade it; Hou refused. When Duke Huan ascended, Stone Bi grew old.

In the second month, on the day *wu-shen*, State Brutus assassinated Duke Huan and proclaimed himself ruler. He sought to avenge his father’s grievance against Zheng and to win favor from the feudal lords, thereby pacifying his people. He sent envoys to Song, declaring: *"If Your Lordship attacks Zheng to eliminate the harm to our ruler, You shall lead the expedition. Our humble state will contribute troops alongside Chen and Cai. This is the sincere wish of Wei."* The people of Song agreed, and thus, as Chen and Cai were in harmony with Wei, Song, Chen, Cai, and Wei joined forces to assault Zheng, besieging its eastern gate for five days before withdrawing.

The Duke of Song sought aid from Lu, but Lu declined. Duke Huan consulted Zhong Zhong, asking: *"Will State Brutus succeed?"* Zhong Zhong replied: *"I have heard that one pacifies the people through virtue, not through chaos. To govern chaos is like winding thread only to tangle it further. State Brutus obstructs the military yet remains cruel; obstructing the military means lacking troops, and cruelty means alienating kin. When the people revolt and kin abandon him, his cause is doomed.

Fire is like war—if unchecked, it will consume itself. State Brutus slew his sovereign and oppressed his people, yet he does not cultivate virtue to secure his rule. Instead, he seeks to achieve his ends through chaos—his downfall is certain. Since State Brutus cannot pacify his people, he sent Hou to seek recognition from the King of Zhou."* Hou asked: *"How may we obtain this recognition?"* Stone Bi replied: *"Duke Huan of Chen now enjoys favor with the King. Chen and Wei are in harmony. If you go to Chen as an envoy to request it, you shall surely succeed."* Hou followed State Brutus to Chen.

Stone Bi sent word to Chen: *"Our state is narrow and small; I am old and feeble, powerless to act. These two men have slain my sovereign—dare I not act against them?"* The people of Chen seized them and demanded they be handed over to Wei. In the ninth month, the people of Wei sent Stone Zai Chu to kill State Brutus at *Pu*. Stone Bi then ordered his steward, Nu Yang Jian, to kill Hou in Chen.

The virtuous say: *"Stone Bi was a loyal subject. He loathed State Brutus yet involved his son. This is what is meant by ‘greater righteousness overrides kinship.’ To follow one’s child in slaying a regicide—the gravest treason against the state—is something that must be eradicated. Hence, ‘greater righteousness overrides kinship.’ To uphold lesser righteousness is to cherish one’s child. To govern without strife and conquer the world—

*Note: To pardon the world and value non-action. If one governs through policies and deceitful warfare, these are all misaligned. Only through non-action and non-strife can one conquer the world.*

*This marks the principle. The annotated text explains it thus: The sagely ruler governs through non-action. Non-action means no strife; no strife means no labor; no labor allows the people to transform naturally, and the world attains great peace.*

*It is said: To govern through policies and deceitful warfare—how can this compare to non-action and non-strife in transforming the world, gathering the people, and achieving national prosperity to bring about peace? How do I know the world is thus? It is evident from this.*

*Note: The following text confirms this. The annotation asks: ‘How do I know?’—a rhetorical question. ‘Thus’—meaning as described. ‘It is evident from this’—the response."*

The Venerable Lord further inquires: *"How do I know that to take the world one must do nothing? The following text states that excessive prohibitions impoverish the people. If I practice non-action, the people will transform naturally—this is evident."*

It is said: *"To seek governance through policies and deceitful warfare is certainly not the way to achieve order. When the ruler multiplies prohibitions, the people grow ever poorer. When the ruler employs cunning strategies, the state grows ever more confused. When strange novelties proliferate, laws become ever more explicit—none of these are the foundations of great peace. Only through non-action and non-strife can one transform all things. From this, the Dao of order and chaos is clearly revealed."*

When the world abounds in prohibitions, the people grow ever poorer.
*Note: When governing through policies, prohibitions multiply.*

People lose their livelihoods, hence the people grow ever poorer.
*Commentary: This reverses the explanation of governing through policies. As ruler of the world, one cannot uphold simplicity and tranquility to transform the people, nor cherish simplicity in governing all things. When policies become intricate and laws dense, the common folk have no room to move—avoiding taboos leaves no time, every action risks losing their livelihood, and they sink daily into destitution. Hence, they grow ever poorer.*

It is said: *"Excessive prohibitions"* refer to laws with many restrictions. Every action risks entanglement in taboos, leading to punishment, and the people cannot sustain life. Grievances and rebellions arise, farming and sericulture decay—thus the people grow ever poorer.
*Explanation: "Poor" means lacking wealth.*

When the ruler practices non-action, laws are broad and simple. The people are unshackled by taboos, follow their nature, and find ease. They dig wells and till fields, drink and eat, and thus the people grow rich while the state flourishes.

When the people abound in cunning devices, the state grows ever more confused.
*Note: "Cunning devices" refers to schemes and stratagems.*

When the ruler relies excessively on schemes and stratagems, unable to return to sincerity, the people respond with deceit and guile—thus the state grows ever more confused and disordered.
*Commentary: This explains the earlier point about employing deceitful warfare. "Cunning devices" are schemes and stratagems. The art of stratagem lies in seizing the moment, used only when necessary. If the ruler relies too much on schemes and stratagems, unable to return to sincerity, the people will not hesitate to respond with deceit and guile—hence the state grows ever more confused and disordered.*

It is said: *"Confused and disordered"* means unclear. When the ruler favors novelty and change, the people emulate deceit and flattery. Deceit spreads between ruler and subjects, and the true path grows unclear—thus arises confusion and disorder.

When the people abound in cleverness, strange novelties proliferate.
*Note: When the ruler indulges in cleverness, unable to value simplicity, the people respond with extravagance—thus strange and decadent things proliferate.*

*Commentary: "Cleverness" means skill. "Clever" refers to refined craftsmanship. "Strange novelties" include carved, inlaid, and ornate treasures and curiosities. It speaks of the ruler not valuing simplicity but favoring superficiality, while the people follow suit, indulging in extravagant competition, and decadent adornments grow ever more elaborate.*

It is said: *"Excessive cleverness delights the eyes, rare treasures unsettle the mind. If the ruler indulges without restraint, the people will only increase their embellishments. Once extravagance takes root, simplicity is forgotten—this is indeed something to be warned against."* The *Spring and Autumn Annals* criticizes the vermilion pillars of the Dan Palace and the carved beams of the Huan Palace, recording them as faults. Zang Wenzhong’s adorned carriage poles were also deemed excessive. Truly, this is to urge the ruler to value frugality and simplicity.

When laws proliferate, thieves and bandits multiply.
*Note: When non-action is abandoned, laws become ever clearer. Those who steal laws for deceitful ends all become thieves and bandits—how could they not multiply?*

*Commentary: "Laws" refer to penal codes. "Orders" refer to edicts. The ruler governs through desires, yet relies on explicit laws to regulate the people. When the people merely seek to avoid punishment without shame, they steal laws to commit deceit. Ruler and subjects deceive each other, hence thieves and bandits multiply.*

It is said: *"Laws are meant to regulate the people. When orders become excessive, deceit arises among the people."* When deceit takes root, thieves and bandits multiply—this is called disordered governance. The *Rites of Zhou* states: *"When the Great Dao is hidden, the world becomes a family. Cities and moats are built for defense, ritual and propriety are used for order, hence schemes are employed and wars arise."* The *Spring and Autumn Annals* says: *"The Xia had disordered governance and created the *Yǔ Xíng* (Criminal Code of Yu), the Yin had disordered governance and created the *Tāng Xíng* (Criminal Code of Tang), the Zhou had disordered governance and created the *Jiǔ Xíng* (Nine Criminal Codes)."* The establishment of these three penal codes all occurred in declining times.

The people, thus, merely avoid punishment without shame—*as Confucius says in the "For Governance" chapter of the *Analects*: *"Guide them with policies, align them with punishments, and the people will avoid punishment without shame."* It speaks of rulers guiding the people with laws and aligning them with punishments. The people fear authority and resort to every means to evade punishment, yet have no concern for shame. Hence the note says: *"They merely avoid punishment."* When the people avoid punishment without shame, they will inevitably steal laws to commit deceit—thus manipulating laws and texts to harm others.

Zhuangzi said: *"Great thieves arise, seizing the sacred laws of the sages to steal their states—how much more so for ordinary thieves?"* *Mont* means to deceive. Stealing laws to commit deceit, subjects deceive their rulers, and rulers harm their subjects. Ruler and subjects deceive each other, and moral transformation fails—this is the root of great disorder. Hence the sage says: *"I practice non-action, and the people transform naturally."*

*Commentary: This explains taking the world through non-action. "I" refers to the sage. The sage’s virtue does not indulge in cleverness; the ruler who embodies the Dao values non-action. Non-action means no prohibitions, and the people transform in response to the ruler’s non-action—hence, "the people transform naturally."*

It is said: *"The people transform through non-action, returning naturally to order."* If one acts, there will be many affairs. Many affairs lead to complex governance. Complex governance increases disorder among the people. Non-action simplifies affairs, and simple affairs lead to clear governance. Clear governance and simple affairs mean the people need no laws or edicts to transform toward goodness.

*"I do nothing, yet the people grow rich."*

「民自化，
　　*Commentary:* This explains how the people transform through the ruler’s non-action. *"I"* refers to the sage. The sage’s virtue does not favor cleverness; the ruler who embodies the Dao/Way values non-action. Non-action means no prohibitions, and the people transform in response to the ruler’s non-action—hence, *"the people transform naturally."*

*"The people transform through non-action, returning naturally to order."* If one acts, there will be many affairs. Many affairs lead to complex governance. Complex governance increases disorder among the people. Non-action simplifies affairs, and simple affairs lead to clear governance. Clear governance and simple affairs mean the people need no laws or edicts to transform toward goodness.

*"I do nothing, yet the people grow rich."*
　　*Commentary:* The ruler imposes no taxes or levies, and the people face no disturbances. They till the fields and dig wells, their households are well-provided, and they have enough to eat—hence, *"the people grow rich."*

*"The people grow rich through non-action."* Wealth is defined by abundance. When the ruler does not burden the people with labor, they freely till the fields and engage in agriculture. With no hindrance to their labor, crops flourish and yield abundantly—thus, the people thrive in wealth. Digging wells and tilling fields is described in ancient poetry as: *"Dig wells to drink, till fields to eat."* This illustrates the Tang Emperor Yao’s governance, where the people lived in non-action, unaware of the ruler’s existence, let alone his care for them. They drank and ate of their own accord, free from worry or distress, so their households were naturally well-provided and their needs naturally met.

*"I love stillness, yet the people grow upright."*

　　*Commentary:* Human nature is born in stillness, a gift of the Dao/Way. If the ruler upholds tranquility without agitation, the people are touched by his virtue, and their inherent nature aligns with uprightness.

*"The people grow upright through stillness."* The *Rites* say: *"Human nature is born in stillness, a gift of the Dao/Way."* When people are born, their nature is pure, untouched by the six dusts (sights, sounds, smells, tastes, textures, ideas) or the six desires (lust, anger, greed, delusion, pride, doubt). They are guided by the original harmony and embody clarity and stillness. But after infancy, love and hate arise, and joy and anger manifest. If the ruler governs through stillness and reason, the people return to simplicity, and thus their nature becomes pure and upright.

*"I have no desires, yet the people grow simple."*

　　*Annotation:* Non-action leads to purity and stillness, so the people transform. No affairs mean no disturbance, so the people grow rich. Loving stillness means preserving their nature, so the people grow upright. Having no desires means safeguarding their essence, so the people grow simple. This is the way of taking the world through non-action.

　　*Commentary:* If the ruler can truly maintain inner simplicity and harmony while externally abandoning all scheming desires, the people will respond, becoming naturally simple and unadorned.

*"The people grow simple through non-desire."* The ruler who has no desires for worldly things allows them to flourish as they should. When the ruler’s desires are absent, the people live in simplicity and naturalness—this is the Dao/Way’s inherent principle. In governing the self, nothing is greater than knowing contentment without desire. In governing the state, nothing is greater than non-action and simplicity; if one truly practices this, both self and state will prosper.

*"Another version adds two lines: 'I have no passions, yet the people grow clear.'*
　　This also aligns with principle and reason, though omitted in the official annotation, so it is included here for completeness.

*"The governance of the state is gentle and unrestrained."*

　　*Commentary:* The previous chapter illustrates how the ruler who loses the Dao/Way’s non-action fails to transform the people. This chapter shows that such governance must inevitably fail, demonstrating the origins of calamity and fortune. It first contrasts two types of governance—gentle and harsh—then reveals how fortune and misfortune are intertwined, hidden and unpredictable. Human confusion leads to the people’s attachment to falsehoods. Thus, the sage below exhorts the ruler to cultivate virtue.

*"The governance of the state is gentle and unrestrained, its people are pure and simple."*

　　*Annotation:* When governance is gentle and unrestrained—practicing non-action and broadness—the people respond, becoming pure and simple in nature.

　　*Commentary:* *"Gentle and unrestrained"* means without scheming or constraint. *"Pure and simple"* means sincere, unadorned, and thick with virtue. The ruler who governs through non-action enacts broad policies, allowing things to unfold naturally. Without harshness or cruelty, the people’s customs become pure and simple.

*"The people grow pure and simple through gentle governance."* When governance is simple, the people are sincere. When the people are sincere, their duties are few. When duties are few, punishments and rewards are unnecessary. The ruler remains silent and trusts worthy ministers, follows natural order, and the state prospers. The Dao/Way of non-action is gradually realized here.

*"Harsh governance leads to strict laws and urgency, while cruel governance enforces punishments without prior warnings."* If laws are given first and punishments follow, the people know how to be taught. If governance is simple and affairs are relaxed, the people know what is forbidden. If one violates the prohibitions and then is punished, then one person’s punishment will make a thousand fear it. If morning decrees are followed by evening punishments, the people do not know the laws—how can this not be cruelty? Much worse is punishing without prior warnings, harming the people greatly.

*"The governance of the state is scrutinizing and strict, its people are deficient and scattered."*

　　*Annotation:* When governance is scrutinizing and strict—practicing scheming and urgency—the people respond, becoming deficient and scattered.

　　*Commentary:* *"Scrutinizing and strict"* means the ruler is overly controlling, binding the people with laws and edicts. Governance becomes narrow and urgent, and thieves and bandits multiply, so the people grow scattered and depleted.

*"The people grow deficient and scattered through scrutinizing governance."* When governance is strict and laws are harsh, the people become disordered. When the people are disordered, the state is ruined. Decay and dispersion begin here. The *Plain Book* says: *"When a state is about to decline, the people first suffer."* When the roots wither, the branches decay; when the people are exhausted, the state is ruined. It is indeed necessary to ease governance, nurture the people, and thus restore the state’s prosperity.

*"Scrutinizing"* refers to spying on the people’s faults while enforcing strict and urgent laws. *"Deficient and scattered"* means decline, ruin, and harm to the people’s harmony.

*"Calamity and fortune are intertwined—who knows their limits?"*

　　*Annotation:* *"Intertwined"* means dependent; *"hidden"* means concealed.

When governance is **muted and unobtrusive** (*wēnwēn*), the people perceive it as lacking in governance and order, yet they remain **pure and unadorned** (*chúnchún*). This is when **calamity becomes the source of fortune**.

When governance is **scrutinizing and overbearing** (*cháchá*), the people regard it as possessing the art of governance, yet they become **deficient and decayed** (*quēquē*). This is when **fortune conceals calamity**.

**Explication:**
*"Calamity as the source of fortune"*—when governance is muted, the people deem it evil, yet they remain pure and sincere. How could this not be fortune arising from calamity?
*"Fortune concealing calamity"*—when governance is overbearing, the people deem it good, yet things wither and decay. How could this not be calamity hidden within fortune?

*"Who knows their limits?"*—Those who stray from the Dao and lose virtue, indulging in deceit and superficiality, thus cause fortune and calamity to cycle endlessly, their rise and fall unpredictable. Who can fathom their depths?

**Explication:**
Heaven and Earth have their periods of rest and decline; the sun and moon have their eclipses and fullness. This is the principle of **interdependence and concealment**.

When fortune is exhausted, calamity arrives; when calamity is spent, fortune returns. The common folk are ensnared by this as an unchanging law.

Only the **Daoist sage** and the **virtuous ruler**, embracing the Way and harmonizing with it, cannot be constrained by yin and yang; maintaining their authenticity and reversing conventional norms, they cannot be swayed by good or evil. Thus, calamity cannot harm them, nor can fortune benefit them—they transcend gain and loss, honor and decline.

Even in matters of state, the wise cannot foresee it; the rise and fall of fortune and calamity are unfathomable.

The state of **Qi** faced the crisis of **Zhong Sun’s rebellion**, yet **Huan Gong** rose to power and became hegemon. The state of **Jin** endured **Li Ke’s treachery**, yet **Wen Gong** emerged to lead the feudal lords. These two states flourished through calamity.

**Wei** enjoyed peace, yet the **Di barbarians** destroyed it. **Qin** basked in security, yet the **Wei** annihilated it. These two states perished without calamity.

Thus, fortune and calamity are interdependent and concealed—no one knows their limits. Hence, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: *"A state may suffer calamity yet expand its territory, or face no calamity yet lose its defenses."* Defenses are unpredictable.

**Explication:**
Does fortune and calamity lack any fixed principle? It is merely because people fail to embody the Dao and non-action, instead indulging in delusion and attachment, thus losing their true nature.

**Explication:**
Common folk are bewildered by fortune and calamity—honor fills them with joy, disgrace with alarm. The more they stray from truth, the more they invite omens and portents. How could they know that if one remains detached in cultivating virtue, even the cry of a rooster or a lost horse need not bring misfortune? Regret and hesitation are unfounded; misfortune is self-invited.

What is deemed "right" becomes "strange," and what is deemed "good" becomes "portentous."

**Annotation:**
Does fortune and calamity lack any fixed principle? It is because sentient beings are deluded, mistaking what is right for deceit and what is good for omens. Thus, fortune and calamity appear without fixed principle.

**Explication:**
The essence of cultivating the Dao lies in responding to change without attachment, adapting like a circle to any vessel. Unshackled by fortune or calamity, undistracted by right or wrong, one who lingers in fortune may see goodness turn to portents, while one misled by right may see rightness become deceit.

Rulers should act according to the times, appointing the right people for the right tasks. If they seek the right too zealously, those who feign correctness will emerge; if they seek goodness too eagerly, those who feign virtue will appear. But if they remain open-hearted, impartial, and promote the worthy, deceit and portents will nearly vanish.

The people’s delusion has endured for long.

**Annotation:**
To mistake the right for deceit and goodness for portents—such delusion has persisted for ages.

**Explication:**
The common folk’s confusion and falsehoods, rooted in long-standing habits, have endured without awakening. The **Laozi** laments their delusion, earnestly instructing them to dispel it.

*"Delusion"* means losing one’s path.

Those who are not swayed by fortune or calamity, nor constrained by right or wrong, whose spirit is boundless and whose acceptance of gain and loss is balanced—how could the notions of right and goodness mislead them?

Thus, the **Sage** is square yet does not cut.

**Explication:**
*"Square"* means adherence to rightness. This extols the Sage’s virtue to encourage emulation.

The Sage broadens the Dao to benefit the age; all things align with rightness. The Sage embodies rectitude, and things naturally respond in kind—not through rigid teachings or coercion, but by aligning with their own nature.

**Explication:**
The Sage governs by setting the example of rectitude; the people follow suit. Since people have already lost their true nature, their confusion arises from failing to distinguish right from wrong, fortune from calamity.

The Sage remains unshamed by calamity, unruffled by fortune. He does not feign rectitude to adorn his heart nor indulge in wrong to drown his resolve. Standing apart from the world, he firmly upholds the Great Balance—thus, all things turn toward rightness.

**Explication:**
*"Clean"* means pure; *"filth"* means turbid. The Sage’s nature is naturally pure, effortlessly transforming those below—not by rejecting their turbidity to exalt his purity.

*"Root"* refers to **Jué**—injury. The Sage’s purity is the foundation of his conduct; he is unharmed by external influences.

**Explication:**
The Sage purifies himself through virtue; the people naturally become pure in response. How could they remain tainted?

In governing, ordinary rulers issue decrees, enforce laws with punishments, encourage with rewards, and entice with incentives—yet only a few follow their commands.

But the Sage does not rely on rewards or punishments, nor on rigid laws. He merely cleanses himself and refines his conduct, and the people transform naturally.

「How could one wait for the ruler to issue decrees and enforce punishments before knowing how to exhort the people? The Sage’s conduct is upright yet not self-indulgent.

**Explication:**
*"Self-indulgent"* means **to apply oneself excessively**—to push one’s uprightness to extremes. The Sage’s actions are never perverse; the people naturally follow and become upright, not because they were previously crooked and he corrects them by enforcing straightness upon the curve.

**Explication:**
The Sage is naturally upright, so he does not need to enforce straightness. By exemplifying uprightness, he leads the people, and they naturally become pure and correct. Thus, both the Sage and the people are upright, and the world is made upright.

If the ruler himself is corrupt and the people flatter him with sycophancy, how could the world be made upright?

The *Book of Documents* **[□] Suì’s Command** states:
*"When my ministers are upright, their successors will be upright.
When my ministers are flatterers, their successors will be corrupt.*
This arises from the ministers’ own lack of uprightness, whereby they fawn upon their ruler.

The *Spring and Autumn Annals* says:
*"When the ruler himself is upright, his commands will be followed without need for orders;
When the ruler himself is not upright, even if he gives orders, they will not be obeyed.*
This further elucidates how the ruler’s own conduct transforms those below, determining whether they follow his uprightness or corruption.

Shining without dazzling.
**Annotation:**
The Sage’s transformation is benevolent—he does not impose rigid standards upon others, nor does he declare their impurities as filth, nor enforce straightness upon them, nor dazzle them with his brilliance. He cultivates himself, and the world naturally transforms.

**Explication:**
*"Shining"* refers to **illuminating wisdom**. Though the Sage possesses great wisdom and hides it in humility, he does not flaunt it. Hence it is said: *shining without dazzling*.

The Sage’s virtue is such that the people naturally follow in purity. **Explication:**
The Sage’s wisdom is bright, yet not forced upon others through ostentation. These four principles—uprightness, non-self-indulgence, non-dazzling, and natural transformation—are all ways the Sage conducts himself to enlighten the people.

By these means, he rules the world and may truly be called a Sage of virtue.

Yet the grand essence lies in discerning auspicious and inauspicious influences, the rise and fall of fortunes, the **Dao’s** subtle and ever-changing workings—**to contain** purity and uprightness within, while nurturing inner clarity.

**To hold** brilliance and uprightness within while inwardly illuminating, he discards harsh and violent measures, and clears his heart with expansive benevolence. Having removed the causes of confusion and rigidity, he naturally attains the marvelous subtlety of the **Dao’s** simplicity.

The *Daoist Classic of the True Virtue of the Sage* concludes here.»

「#1 The *Yǔrén* [卫人] [note: "Yǔrén" here refers to the people of the State of **Wei** (卫)] errs in reading *shí* [石] as *chǒu* [丑]. According to the *Zuǎnzhuàn* [*Leftovers Classic*, i.e., *Spring and Autumn Annals* (《左传》)], *shí* [石] should be read as *yòu* [右].

**Daoist Classic of the True Virtue of the Sage, Volume Forty-One**
Attributed to **Tang Guangcheng** [唐广成] Master by **Du Guangting** [杜光庭]
**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Governing the People and Serving Heaven**
Commentary: The previous chapter expounds the principle of **non-action** in governance, whereby the people naturally attain simplicity and harmony.

This chapter elucidates the **Dao’s** guidance in governing the people and serving Heaven—**frugality** is the foremost means.

First, it marks that governing the people and serving Heaven cannot surpass **frugality**.
Next, it follows the **Way’s** transformative logic to uphold the earlier principle.
This is called "lifting from below" to illustrate the **Dao’s** enduring roots, thus comparing the **Way’s** long-lasting efficacy.

**Commentary on the Principle:**
The previous chapter presented the four virtues of the Sage—**rectitude, purity, brilliance, and uprightness**—to instruct in governing the state.
This chapter clarifies that **frugality** is the key to serving Heaven, through its fourfold application.
To govern well is to extend one’s lineage through the **Dao’s** abundance; to serve Heaven well is to prolong one’s life through the **Dao’s** constancy.
This continues the meaning of the previous chapter.

In governing the people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses **frugality**.
**Annotation:** *Frugality* (啬) is **love** (爱).
When a ruler seeks to govern the people and serve Heaven, nothing surpasses **love of expenditure** (爱费), ensuring granaries are full and the people observe propriety.
If the three seasons [#1] bring no harm, Heaven will bestow its blessings.
Harmony among the people enables governance; Heaven’s protection allows service to Heaven.

**Commentary:** *Frugality* (啬) is **love** (爱).
It states that when a ruler seeks to transform the people below and respectfully serve the **Celestial Sovereign** (上帝), the first virtue is **love of expenditure** (爱费), which is the virtue of **frugality** (俭).
**Frugality** (俭) ensures sufficiency; sufficiency gathers the people.
Abundant offerings and complete preparations reflect the **Dao’s** clarity in Heaven’s service.
Thus, it is said that nothing surpasses **frugality**.

**Commentary on the Principle:**
Indeed, **frugality** is the first step in managing affairs.
Wealth is the foundation for gathering the people.
Therefore, the *Yìjīng* [*Classic of Changes*] says: "How to gather the people? By wealth (财)."
Wealth, without **frugality**, easily dissipates; the people, without abundant wealth, are hard to gather.
Thus, conserving wealth reduces waste; reducing waste enriches the people; enriching the people secures the state and strengthens its power.

The four great uses of a state are:
1. Sacrifices and offerings (祭祀),
2. Military affairs (戎事),
3. Guests and hospitality (宾客),
4. Kitchen and provisions (庖膳).
Sacrifices and offerings are to **manifestly serve** the **Celestial Sovereign** (上帝).
The **Son of Heaven** (天子) offers sacrifices to Heaven at the **Altar of Earth** (郊), and to the **Ancestral Temple** (宗) at the **Hall of Light** (明堂), signifying reverence.
How can one not be **pure, reverent, and respectful** (不蠲洁恭恪) in such service?

When offerings are abundant and complete—such as in the *Chūnqiū* [*Spring and Autumn Annals*]’ account of **Duke Huan of Qi** (桓公) in the sixth year, when **King Wu of Chu** (楚武王) invaded **Rui** (随)—
Rui’s minister **Bo Dong** (董成) and **Bǐ** (比), the **Earl of Guo** (国伯), spoke to the **Chu Lord** (楚子) saying:
*"We cannot fulfill our ambitions in the east of Han [#1], but it is because of this that we have made it so.
If we deploy our three armies, clad in our armor and weapons, and confront them with our might, they will surely fear.
Yet they will unite in plotting against us, making our demands hard to hear.
Among the states east of Han, Rui is the greatest.
If Rui is mobilized, it will abandon the smaller states.
The smaller states’ defection would be advantageous to Chu.
The **Minister Bo** (少师) is extravagant; let me summon the **Minister of Music** (赢师) to mobilize them."*

**Bǐ** (比), with **Xióng Lǜ** (熊率) leading the music and instruments, replied:
*"Rui has the virtuous minister Ji Liang [季良]; what benefit would there be?"*

**Dòu Bǐ** (斗伯比) said:
*"It is for future considerations. Ji Liang’s loyalty cannot be surpassed; he would follow once seen."*

The **Minister Bo** (少师) gained the favor of Rui’s lord.
Following the **Minister Bo**’s plan, the **Chu Lord** (楚子) destroyed his army and accepted the **Minister Bo**.
When the **Minister Bo** returned, he requested pursuit of the **Chu forces**.
Rui’s lord was about to agree, but Ji Liang stopped him, saying:
*"Heaven is now granting favor to Chu; Chu has defeated its army and is luring us.
My lord, why hasten so?
I have heard that the small can oppose the great, and the small can rectify the great’s excesses.
The **Dao** is to be loyal to the people and sincere to the spirits.
When the ruler considers the people’s benefit, that is loyalty;
When the **priests and historians** (祝史) properly recite the sacrificial words, that is sincerity.
If the people are impoverished while the ruler indulges his desires, and the **priests and historians** falsify the rites in sacrifice,
I do not believe it can be so."*

Rui’s lord said:
*"Our sacrificial animals are plump and fat, our music is grand and complete; why should it not be sincere?"*

Ji Liang replied:
*"The people are the spirits’ foundation.
Thus, the Sage-rulers first establish the people, then exert effort to serve the spirits.
When offering the animals, they say: ‘**Abundant and flourishing, plump and fat** (博硕肥瞃).’
This means the people’s strength is universally preserved,
Their livestock is vast and thriving,
They are not afflicted by sickness or decay,
And all things are prepared in full.
When offering the abundant **sacrificial grains** (粢盛), they say: ‘**Pure and plentiful** (洁粢丰盛).’
This means the three seasons bring no harm, and the people are harmonious with bountiful years.
When offering the **sacrificial wine** (酒醴), they say: ‘**Sweet rice, delicious wine** (嘉栗旨酒).’
This means the ruler and subjects both possess **auspicious virtue** (嘉德) and have no conflicting hearts.
The **three seasons** [#1] are without **slander and deceit** (谗慝).
If one attends to the **three seasons**,
Cultivates proper instruction,
And cherishes the **nine clans** (九族),
Then sacrifices will be offered in full,
The people will be harmonious, and the spirits will bestow blessings,
Thus all actions will succeed.
Now the people each have their own hearts, and the **ghosts and spirits** lack a foundation.
Though the ruler may be alone in abundance, how can there be blessings?
My lord should first cultivate governance,
And cherish the states of his brothers,
Perhaps then you may avoid calamity.
Rui’s lord, fearing, cultivated governance, and Chu dared not attack.*

The **three seasons** are:
Spring plowing (春耕),
Summer sowing (夏种),
Autumn harvesting (秋收)—
The three critical times for agriculture.

**Frugality alone** is called **"early service"** (早服).
**Annotation:** The *Yìjīng* says: "How to gather the people? By wealth (财)."
Thus, if one can **restrain and love** (检爱) properly,
The people of all four directions will come bearing offerings,
Serving their lord in **early submission**.

**Service** (服) means **to attend to** (事).
**Commentary:** *Frugality alone*—this repeats the earlier text.
**"Early service"** (早服) elucidates the meaning of **frugality**.
In all seven transformations [#1], the principle remains consistent.
**"Frugality alone"** (夫唯啬) is merely a rhetorical opening.
**"Service"** (服) means **to attend to** (事).
Only a ruler who practices **frugality and love** (俭爱) can govern the people and serve Heaven,
Taking **frugality** as his governance.
Thus, under Heaven’s vast expanse,
The people will naturally submit early to serve such a ruler.

**Commentary on the Principle:**
If **frugality** is the guiding virtue,
The state will surely be wealthy.
The ruler has no excessive luxury,
The people have no resentment over hoarding.
By such governance, the people submit,
By such service, Heaven is **illuminated** (明),
And all under Heaven will follow, rallying to his virtue.

The *"How to gather the people? By wealth"* (何以聚人曰财) is from the *Yìjīng* [*Classic of Changes*]’s **Lower Appendix** (下系), which states:
*"The greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth is **generation** (生).
The greatest treasure of the Sage is **position** (位).
How to uphold position? By **ren** (仁).
How to gather the people? By wealth (财)."*」

Wealth is the means by which life is sustained.
To gather the people, one must first possess wealth.
When wealth is abundant, the people can be gathered;
If wealth is used with moderation and governed rightly,
The people will not act wickedly,
And thus can be gathered and settled in peace.

To submit early is called *accumulating virtue* (重积德).
**Commentary:**
He who practices frugality already possesses virtue.
The people follow virtue,
And thus serve their ruler early.
Hence, it is said: *accumulating virtue*.

**Exegesis:**
Why do all under Heaven revere his transformation,
And all lands unite in his virtue?
It is through practicing moderation.
Moderation brings early submission from the people,
Thus *accumulating virtue* is achieved.

**Principle:**
When the ruler practices moderation,
He *accumulates virtue* anew.
The people increasingly rally to him.
All under Heaven, all lands—
As the *Shijing* ["Classic of Poetry"] says in *"North Mountain"* (北山篇):
*"All under Heaven is not without the King’s land;
All lands’ borders are not without the King’s people."*
*Dà* (溥) means vast;
*shuài* (率) means to follow;
*bīn* (滨) means boundary.
To *accumulate virtue* is to achieve the unattainable.

**Commentary:**
The Sage accumulates virtue,
And the four seas submit—
There is nothing he cannot subdue.
*Kè* (克) means ability.

**Exegesis:**
If a ruler deeply accumulates virtue,
His governance preserves all human strength;
His service to Heaven brings unceasing good fortune.
Thus, the four quarters turn toward his transformation,
And there is nothing he cannot subdue.

**Principle:**
Frugality governs the state,
Reverence serves Heaven,
*Accumulating virtue* anew,
The four quarters follow his transformation—
None dare resist.
To achieve the unattainable is boundless.

**Commentary:**
The ruler’s virtue knows no limits in subjugation,
Thus no distance is unreachable.
Hence, the four quarters know no bounds.

**Exegesis:**
This means the ruler’s virtue knows no limits in subjugation,
So distant peoples admire his transformation,
And remote lands observe his ways—
No distance is unreachable,
Thus no bounds are known.

**Principle:**
When the ruler accumulates profound virtue,
The state is wealthy,
Ten thousand households return to the King,
The Nine Enclosures present tribute—
The people submit to his moral transformation.
Is there any limit?

**Distant peoples and remote lands**—
These are the outlying regions beyond the frontier,
Differing in customs and distant in governance,
Speaking of how foreign peoples yearn for the Sage’s transformation,
Coming from afar.
This is the power of moral transformation.

**Those who observe the winds**—
As the *Records of the Ten Isles* (*Shízōu Jì*) state:
*"Jùkū Zhou* (聚窟洲) lies in the Western Sea,
In the lands of *Shēnwèi* (申未),
Three thousand *lǐ* in expanse,
Thirty million *lǐ* from China.
When its people constantly observe the east wind harmonizing with the *lǜ* (律),
For a hundred *xún* (旬) without cease,
Then China will have a ruler who cherishes the Dao.
Thus, in the *Yánhé* (延和) third year of Han Wudi,
Its people sent envoys bearing *fǎnhún xiāng* (返魂香),
Wild beasts,
Riding flying chariots across the Weak River,
And galloping celestial steeds over the Flying Sands.
Thirteen years later, they reached China.
This is observing the winds and admiring the transformation.

The limits of which none know—
Thus may one truly have a realm.

**Commentary:**
*"None know its utmost bounds"*—
Only then may one be said to possess a realm.

**Exegesis:**
The sovereign’s virtue and transformation
Reach without limit, all people drawn to him,
Divine blessings bestowed—
Then alone may he be called one who has a realm.
As the *Book of Changes* says:
*"The king, with his temple and his family"*—
This is the case.

Beyond this, how can there be a realm?

**Doctrine:**
One who truly has a realm—
Where the tracks of chariots extend,
Where script and law are shared,
Where people submit to his virtue,
Where distant lands revere his transformation—
This is what may be called a realm.

Some rely on martial might or deceitful schemes,
Yet if the people do not submit,
Or if, though inheriting the throne and observing the charts,
His virtue falters and his grace does not permeate—
These are not realms.

*"The king, with his temple and his family"*—
From the *Book of Changes*, the *Suì* hexagram:
*"The king, with his temple—
This is the gathering of filial piety for sacrifice."*
*"Gathering"* means assembling.
The king, by gathering the people to his temple,
Can then govern filial sacrifice—
Thus it says: *"It is advantageous to see the great man."*
Gathering is for rectification—
Observe what is gathered, and the nature of heaven, earth, and all things becomes manifest.

**Doctrine:**
When the world is in chaos and the people grieve,
Even with sacrifices, it is as though there were no temple.
Only when the king reaches the time of great gathering,
And filial virtue is fully realized,
May he be said to truly have a temple.
Then, with great sacrifices offered,
The divine blessings descend.

When the gathering of the Way is complete,
And the temple is established,
Filial sacrifice is properly governed.

*"The king, with his family"*—
From the *Book of Changes*, the *Jiārén* hexagram, line nine-five:
*"The king, with his family—
No need for concern."*
The *Symbol* says:
*"The king, with his family—
This is mutual love."*
When the king establishes the family’s Way,
None below remain untransformed.
When the world is transformed,
The six relationships harmonize—
Thus it says: *"Mutual love."*
The *Huàn* hexagram also says:
*"The king, with his temple"*—
Its meaning is the same.

The mother of a realm—
This may endure long.

**Commentary:**
If one who has a realm nourishes the people abundantly,
Then his blessings and lineage may endure long.

**Exegesis:**
*"Mother"* refers to the Way—
Abundant nourishment is its meaning.
Only by having the Way
May one be called one who has a realm.
If he nourishes the myriad people thus,
His blessings and lineage flourish eternally—
This may endure long.

**Doctrine:**
With accumulated virtue governing,
Using the Way to nourish the people,
All under heaven turn to him,
As children to their mother.
Then the heavenly mandate covers him,
The divine responds in harmony,
A lifespan of eight hundred years—
This is not yet eternal security,
Yet it may endure long in his realm.

This is called the Way of deep roots and firm foundations,
Of long life and enduring vision.

**Commentary:**
When virtue accumulates and the realm is established,
Its roots are deep and its foundations firm.
The profound and firm—
This is the Way of long life and enduring vision.

**Exegesis:**
The sovereign, with virtue and the Way,
Nourishes the living.
With frugality governing the world,
Abundant wealth makes the realm rich,
Accumulated virtue makes blessings ascend,
Near and far turn in devotion,
Huaxia and the barbarians submit in unison.
He also nurtures all things as a mother,
Loves all living beings as a child—
Deep roots make his blessings boundless,
Firm foundations make his descendants eternal.
Long life and enduring vision—
Like the rejuvenation of the phoenix,
Unfathomable in its splendor.

The cultivated adept,
Preserving his spirit to tranquilize his form,
Accumulating *qi* to maintain harmony,
Fortifying the three passways within,
Dispelling all ten thousand worries without,
All spirits submit in service,
All actions flow in perfect cycle,
Transformation knows no end—
His years are long, his vision enduring.
His foundation is firm in the domain of *Hun Yuan*,
His roots deep in the court of *Wu You*,
Standing shoulder to shoulder with the Nine Elders and Seven Immortals.

**Chapter Sixty: Governing the Great Realm**

**Exegesis:**
The previous chapter made clear:
If the ruler is frugal and loving,
All under heaven will submit early.

This chapter makes clear:
If the affairs of the realm are not disturbed,
Then virtue will return in harmony.

First, it presents the analogy of governing the realm—
No action should be taken.
Next, it shows how virtue extends to ghosts and spirits,
Harming neither.
Finally, it concludes with the praise of returned virtue,
To exhort the sovereign of a realm.

**Doctrine:**
There are two kinds of great realms:
The first is the realm of the Son of Heaven,
The second is the realm of the public lords.

The Son of Heaven rules the great realm,
Nurturing the myriad people—
Too lenient, and they become disrespectful;
Too harsh, and they scatter.
Using the analogy of cooking fresh meat—
The principle is clear.

If he governs with the Way,
Then ghosts and spirits serve as guests,
The living and the unseen each find fulfillment,
And virtue and blessings return in harmony.
This is the exhortation to the sovereign:
To govern and transform with the Way.

The realm of the Son of Heaven—
Within the four seas, there are nine states.
Each state is nine thousand *lǐ* in expanse,
With thirty states of one hundred *lǐ*,
Sixty states of seventy *lǐ*,
And one hundred twenty states of fifty *lǐ*—
A total of two hundred ten states.
Great mountains and marshes are not granted as fiefs,
The rest are auxiliary lands and vacant fields.

The great states of one hundred *lǐ*—
These are the states of the Three Dukes.
The medium states of seventy *lǐ*—
These are the states of the Six Ministers.
The small states of fifty *lǐ*—
These are the states of the Twelve Lesser Ministers.
Great mountains and marshes are shared with the people,
No monopolization allowed—
Only taxes are levied.
This was the ancient system.

The Shang system:
The Son of Heaven’s realm was nine thousand *lǐ* in expanse,
With a thousand *lǐ* at its center as the Son of Heaven’s domain,
And the remaining eight thousand *lǐ* as the nine states.

The system established by the Duke of Zhou:
The great boundaries of the nine states were seven thousand *lǐ* in expanse.
States of one thousand *lǐ* in expanse numbered forty-nine,
With one as the Son of Heaven’s domain,
And the remaining forty-eight as the eight states.

Each state had six thousand-*lǐ* territories.

Under the Shang system, within each state, a feudal domain of five hundred *lǐ* was granted no more than four times—these were called great states. Again, domains of four hundred *lǐ* were granted eleven times—these were called medium states. Domains of two hundred *lǐ* were granted no more than twenty-five times, and the remaining domains of one hundred *lǐ* were called small states, totaling forty-six states. Within one state, there were two hundred twenty states, leaving one hundred sixty-four domains of one hundred *lǐ* as vassal lands.

Within the Son of Heaven’s domain, there were nine states of one hundred *lǐ*, twenty-one of seventy *lǐ*, and sixty-three of fifty *lǐ*, totaling ninety-three states. Great mountains and marshes were not granted to the Duke of Zhou’s descendants. The rest were granted as *xián* lands to ennoble the scholars.

The Son of Heaven’s residence was also called a *xiàn* or a *jì*. In total, the Nine States comprised one thousand seven hundred seventy-three states.

During the times of Yao, Shun, and Yu, the feudal states of the feudal lords were of one hundred, seventy, or fifty *lǐ* in expanse. In Yu’s time, the inner *yàofú* region was seven hundred *lǐ* in expanse. The Duke of Zhou restored the ancient domains of Yao and Shun, establishing the Five Regions as the Nine States, with the inner *yàofú* region spanning seven thousand *lǐ*.

It was also said: The Zhou arranged for eighteen hundred feudal lords to be distributed within five thousand *lǐ*.

Within one thousand *lǐ* of the Son of Heaven, the lands were supplied for the palace. Within two thousand *lǐ*, provisions were made for the Son of Heaven’s clothing and food. Beyond two thousand *lǐ*, the *fāngbó* were appointed. Five states were grouped as a *shǔ*, with a *shǔ* leader; ten states formed a *lián*, with a *lián* commander; thirty states formed a *zuò*, with a *zuò* officer. Two hundred ten states formed a state, with a *bó* (marquis) as its ruler. The eight states had eight *bó*s, fifty-six *zhèng*s, one hundred sixty-eight *lián* commanders, and three hundred thirty-six *shǔ* leaders. Each eight hundred states, with their vassals, were placed under the charge of the Son of Heaven’s elders—two men—who served as his left and right *bó*s, namely the Duke of Zhou and the Marquis of Shao, who governed the region of Shàn.

Within one thousand *lǐ* was the *diàn* (domain of direct rule). *Diàn* means governance; beyond one thousand *lǐ* was the *cǎi* (tributary region). *Cǎi* meant taking its fine products, sometimes offered as tribute, sometimes not. The Son of Heaven appointed three ministers, nine officials, twenty-seven great officers, and eighty-one *yuànshì* (assistant officers). Great states had three ministers, all appointed by the Son of Heaven. Below them were five *xiàdàfū* (lower great officers) and twenty-seven *shàngshì* (upper officers). Medium states had three ministers, two appointed by the Son of Heaven and one by their lord, with five *xiàdàfū* and twenty-seven *shàngshì*. Small states had two ministers, both appointed by their lord, with five *xiàdàfū* and twenty-seven *shàngshì*.

This was the system of the Zhou, augmented and reduced from the institutions of the Tang, Yu, Xia, and Shang.

When King Cheng was in Fèng, after overthrowing the Shang mandate and exterminating the Huái barbarians, he established the *Zhōu Guān* (Institutes of Zhou) and appointed the Grand Teacher, Grand Tutor, and Grand Guardian—these were the Three Ministers—who deliberated on the Dao and governed the realm, harmonizing yin and yang. The Minor Teacher, Minor Tutor, and Minor Guardian were called the Three *Gū* (Orphans), assisting the ministers in spreading virtue and upholding the Mandate of Heaven.

The Grand Officer of Heaven (*Tiānguān Zhòngzǎi*) managed state affairs, overseeing all officials and equalizing the Four Seas. The Grand Officer of Earth (*Sītú*) managed education, promulgating the Five Codes and instructing the myriad people. The Grand Officer of Ancestral Sacrifices (*Zōngbó*) managed rituals, coordinating the divine and human, and harmonizing the upper and lower. The Grand Officer of Martial Affairs (*Sīmǎ*) managed state governance, commanding the Six Armies and pacifying the realm. The Grand Officer of Justice (*Sīkòu*) managed state laws, investigating crimes, and punishing violence and disorder. The Grand Officer of Works (*Sīkōng*) managed state lands, settling the Four Classes, and utilizing the seasons and terrain.

The Six Ministers divided their duties, each leading their subordinates to assist the Nine Superintendents (*jiǔmù*) and enrich the myriad people. This was the Zhou system.

The Tang and Yu had only one hundred officials, the Xia and Shang doubled that, doubling the Tang and Yu. The Zhou system was complete, and thus the realm was orderly.

To govern a great state is like cooking a small fish—do not disturb it. *(Note: Cooking a small fish requires gentle handling; likewise, governing a great state must not be burdensome, for burdensome rule exhausts the people, and disturbance ruins the fish.)* *(Cushion: This is an analogy. To cook a small fish, one must not disturb it, or it will disintegrate. Likewise, governing a great state must not be burdensome, or the people will rebel. All must be done with the Dao to achieve success.)* *(Meaning: The difficulty of governing a state is likened to the art of cooking fish. If not handled gently, the fish spoils; if not governed wisely, the people suffer. The key is ease and gradual transformation.)*

If one governs the realm with the Dao, the spirits will not manifest their power. *(Note: If one rules with the Dao, seeking no false blessings, the spirits have no means to display their supernatural influence.)* *(Cushion: *Yì* means "use," *lì* means "to rule." Spirits dwell in obscurity as ghosts. "Spirit" refers to supernatural responses; if people summon them, they respond. But if the ruler’s virtue is perfect, the people are secure, and neither the ruler invokes imperial power nor does anyone petition the spirits. Thus, the ghosts in obscurity have no way to display their supernatural brilliance.)* *(Meaning: When a ruler governs with the Dao, the people are content and obedient. The spirits, having no cause to intervene, cannot display their power. Even if they are supernatural, they cannot interfere with one who follows the Dao.)*

Heavenly spirits are called *shén*, earthly spirits are called *zhǐ*, and human spirits are called *guǐ*. All are obscure and unseen, hidden and unclear. If they encounter a ruler of virtue and morality, they will cause no harm.

It is not that their spirits are not powerful, but that their power does not harm the people. *(Note: Earlier, it was said that their spirits are not powerful, not meaning that the spirits cease to exist, but that their power does not manifest to harm people.)* *(Cushion: This clarifies the meaning that the spirits do not display their power to harm people. It is not that the spirits vanish, but that their influence does not arise unless provoked by human misconduct. If people maintain their virtue, the spirits do not manifest harm.)*

The *Chūnqiū* says: **"Its qi and flames are seized upon."**

In meaning: A ruler of virtue and morality is upright and without partiality. Heavenly spirits cannot harm people, and human ghosts cannot harm things. Dark spirits conceal themselves, and calamitous omens do not arise. Therefore, when a state prospers, the luminous spirits descend to observe its virtue. The gods of the four seas, riding in white chariots upon clouds, came to pay homage to King Wǔ—this is the case. When a state falls, the spirits descend to observe its wickedness. The stone spoke of Jìn, and the spirit descended upon Cuì—this is when ghosts and spirits manifest as portents.

Moreover, Húzǐ meditated in darkness while the great sorcerer Bōtuàn fled, and the Prefect of Yè was broken while the River Spirit perished. This shows that ghosts and spirits cannot harm those who follow the Dao. The phrase *"its qi and flames are seized upon"* refers to the *Chūnqiū* account of **Zhuānggōng’s fourteenth summer**, when **Lìgōng of Zhèng** raided Zhèng from Lì. Arriving at Dàlíng, he captured the official Fú Xiá. Fú Xiá said: *"If you release me, I will surrender the lord."* They made a pact and pardoned him.

On the sixth month, *jiǎzǐ*, Fú Xiá killed Zhèng’s Zǐyí and his two sons, then surrendered Lìgōng. Earlier, Zhèng had a calamity: an inner serpent and an outer serpent fought, and the inner serpent died in the southern gate. Six years later, Lìgōng entered Zhèng. The duke, hearing this, asked Shēnshùn: *"Are there still calamities?"* He replied: *"What people dread, their qi and flames are seized upon."* Meaning, like fire that has not yet fully ignited—when it is at the point of rising or subsiding—this is used to illustrate a person’s heart lacking firmness and rectitude. Portents arise from human actions; if people provide no provocation, portents do not act of their own accord. When people abandon propriety, portents arise, and thus there are portents. After Lìgōng entered, he executed Fú Xiá. He said to Yuán Fán: *"Fú Xiá was disloyal; the Zhou laws have fixed punishments. Though he surrendered me with no treachery, I have already granted his superiors high office, and I wish to discuss this with my elder brother. Moreover, when I was exiled, my elder brother spoke no kindly words. Upon my return, he did not even remember me. Though the state has a sovereign, his heart was elsewhere—I resent this."*

Yuán Fán replied: *"The former duke, Huánggōng, commanded my clan to oversee the ancestral temple and fields. Though the state has a sovereign, his heart was elsewhere—how could this be disloyal? If one governs the state, all within its borders are his subjects. A subject has no divided heart—this is Heaven’s decree. Zǐyí held office for fourteen years, yet plotted to summon you in secret—is this not treachery? The duke’s sons still number eight; if they all held office, received emoluments, and encouraged disloyalty, how could this aid the state? Your servant has received his orders."* He then hanged himself and died.

The **Dao** does not harm the people unless they harm the **qi** of the gods, nor does the Sage harm the people. **Annotation:** *"If the gods witness the **qi** of the people as monstrous, they will harm them; if the Sage acts, he will harm them."*

Now, the reason the **qi** of the gods does not appear monstrous yet harms the people is that the Sage governs with **wuwei** and clarity, remaining undisturbed. **Exegesis:** *"What is meant by the gods not harming the people is not merely that the gods lack efficacy and cannot harm them, but that the Sage governs through the **Dao**, acting without interference, allowing the people to self-correct. Thus, it is said that the Sage also does not harm the people. The reason the gods cannot appear monstrous and harm the people is that the Sage governs the world through the **Dao**. To further elucidate the Sage’s virtue, it is repeated that the Sage does not harm the people."*

**Exegesis:** *"The Sage governs the world through the **Dao** and assumes his sovereign position. The gods follow the Sage’s virtue and thus remain tranquil. Since the Sage’s governance eliminates disturbance through action, the gods naturally lack the capacity to harm through monstrous appearances. This is the transformation of the gods by the Sage’s **virtue/power**—they dare not harm the people. The Sage, through his clarity and tranquility, does not labor over the masses."*

Now, both—the Sage and the gods—do not harm each other, so their virtues mutually return. **Annotation:** *"If the gods harm the people, it brings misfortune to the state and diminishes its foundation. If the Sage harms the people, it exhausts the gods’ virtue and depletes their offerings."*

Since neither harms the other, their virtues mutually return. **Exegesis:** *"The two refer to the Sage and the gods. The people are the foundation of the state and also the sovereign of the gods. If the gods harm the people, they damage the state’s foundation; if the Sage harms the people, he exhausts the gods’ sovereign. When neither harms the people, their virtues mutually return. This is not only the prosperity of the gods and the Sage but also the reliance of countless people."*

**Exegesis:** *"The people are the foundation of the state; if the foundation is secure, the state will be at peace. The people are the sovereign of the gods; if the sovereign is stable, the gods will be honored. The Sage governs through the **Dao**, and since he does not harm the people, the gods respond to his benevolent influence, also not harming them. Both are pleased with each other, and their virtues mutually return."*

The *Chūnqiū* records Zǐyí’s remonstrance with the Lord of Zōu: *"The gods depend upon the people. The people are the sovereign of the gods."* The *Shàngshū* [□fǔ Xíng] states: *"When one person rejoices, countless people rely upon him."* Ten billion is called *zǎo* (兆), emphasizing their multitude. The Son of Heaven governs through the **Dao** and does not harm the people; the gods are moved by his transformation, and neither harms the other. Thus, all under Heaven are at peace, and it is said that countless people rely upon him. **Annotation:** *"Rely (赖) means to depend upon; exhaust (匮) means to lack; diminish (亏) means to harm."*

This clearly demonstrates that governing through the **Dao** benefits the state greatly, not only securing the hearts of all within the world but also ensuring the gods’ submission as guests. If governance is thus, how can evil spirits and seductions interfere?

That the people are the sovereign of the gods is illustrated in the *Chūnqiū*’s account of Duke Lí of Sòng in the 19th year: When the Duke of Sòng sent the Lord of Zōu to use the sacrificial victim Yǎnzǐ at the altar of Cìsuī, Zǐyú said: *"In ancient times, the six domestic animals did not serve one another; minor rites did not use major sacrificial beasts. How much less would they dare use humans! Sacrificial rites are for the people. The people are the sovereign of the gods. Who would enjoy the sacrifice if humans were used?"*

The Duke of Qí preserved three fallen states and offered them to the feudal lords. Even righteous men called this thin virtue, yet now you meet with one and oppress the three sovereigns, speaking of seizing the sacrificial victim Ténzǐ and using Yǎnzǐ, and further using the licentious and depraved ghosts to seek hegemony—is this not difficult? To gain death would be fortunate. I fear you will bring ruin to the state."*

「Zǐyú was the son of the Duke of Qí, named Mùyí.

The waters of Sùi flow from Biàn into Sì, where a demonic spirit resides. The Eastern Yí tribes would slaughter humans to sacrifice to it there. The saying that *"the six domestic animals do not serve one another"* means that when sacrificing to the spirit of a horse (Mǎzǔ), one would not use a horse, much less would they dare use humans! Now, the Sage cultivates the people with the Dao, and the gods and spirits reciprocate blessings—both benefit without hindrance—this can be called **mysterious virtue (玄德)**.

#1 *"Three times"* should be *"fragrant offerings (馨香)"*.
#2 *"While plotting to summon the former lord"* should be *"while summoning the former lord (昔者)"*.

**Chapter 61 of *The Broad Explication of the Dao and Virtue* by Master Dàguāngchéng of the Táng Dynasty, annotated by Dù Guāngtíngng:**
The previous chapter illustrates how governing with the Dao brings virtue in return.
This chapter illustrates how virtue benefits the people, and thus things return to humility and yielding.

First, it is marked that a great state uses humility, hence its ability to **encompass and transform (摄化)**.
Next, it explains why a great state should yield to lesser ones, so that each may obtain what they desire.
Last, it warns that a great state must particularly practice humility.

**Explanation:**
Humility is the foundation of virtue; yielding is the root of nobility.
When a great state employs humility, lesser states return to **ren (仁)**.
When the great sea yields to rivers, all streams gather and flow toward it.
Thus, the analogy: the female prevails through softness, governance through tranquility.
A great state gathers people through humility and yielding; a lesser state submits through deference and follows above.
Each remains in its proper place, and all find their fitting role.
This is the ultimate principle for governing a state and nurturing oneself.

In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, during the 30th year of Duke Zhāo (昭公), the minister Yóují of Zhèng answered the great officer Shì Jìngbó of Jìn:
*"When a lesser state serves a greater one, it must be respectful of its timing and commands.
When a greater state addresses a lesser one, it must relieve what the lesser one lacks.
The ancient kings’ system was to take what was sufficient and nothing more—
this was to foster mutual goodwill.
This is indeed the essential principle for great and small states:
humility and yielding, not imposing strength over weakness."*

A great state is the **lowest stream (下流)**—the gathering place of all under Heaven.
**Annotation:** *"Lowest stream"* refers to **humble virtue (谦德)**.
When a great state yields and opens itself to receive others,
all under Heaven will gather there.
**Explanation:**
The rivers and streams flow into the great sea, which is below them—
thus, it is called *"lowest stream."*
When applied to people, this is **humble virtue**.
A ruler of a great state must practice yielding and humility,
so that all under Heaven may gather and assemble there—
then the state can preserve its greatness.
Thus, it is said: *"The lowest stream is the gathering of all under Heaven."*

**Explanation:**
All living beings thrive under guidance; the ruler is their shepherd.
Establishing a state and nation, the Dao and virtue must come first.
When virtue benefits the people and the Dao nurtures all things,
the state grows greater while the ruler’s heart remains humble;
the more people return, the more the ruler yields—
ten thousand myriads find joy in submission,
distant and near gather in harmony—
is this not correct?

The gathering of all under Heaven is like the **female (牝)**.
The female always prevails through **tranquility (静)**, over the male.

**Annotation:** *"The gathering of all under Heaven"* is repeated from earlier to reinforce the meaning of *"lowest stream."*
**Explanation:**
The reason all under Heaven gather and assemble is because the great state practices humility and yielding.
The analogy is like the female, which is always sought by the male through its **tranquility (雌静)**.
This passage states that tranquility is yielding—
thus, it clarifies that the female always prevails over the male
because it yields through tranquility.

**Explanation:**
Tranquility governs the self, ensuring **harmonized qi (气和)** and **unfettered spirit (神畅)**.
Tranquility governs the state, ensuring **broad virtue (德广)** and **people’s return (人归)**.
This is what is meant by *"tranquility as yielding."*

Thus, when a great state yields to lesser states,
it can take their people.
**Explanation:** *"Thus"* continues the previous passage to conclude the earlier meaning.
The reason a great state’s ruler does not rely on coercion or force
but employs humility and yielding to subdue others
is to embrace and bring in dependent lords,
taking their people as subjects—
this is the way of a great state.

**Explanation:**
When a great state governs with humility and tranquility,
people naturally attach themselves to it.
It does not rely on threats or schemes of power,
so lesser states embrace **ren (仁)** and seek to become its subjects—
the state grows broader while its people multiply.

When a great state can pacify lesser states,
like Jìn as the leader of the alliance,
though the state of Wèi expelled its lord and installed Piāo,
Jìn intended to punish it.
The Duke of Jìn consulted Zhōng Hángxiànzǐ (中行献子), who replied:
*"It would be better to stabilize it gradually.
Attacking it may not succeed,
and it would disturb the other feudal lords."*

The historian Shì (史) said:
*"Embrace the heavy burden and pacify them."*
Zhōnghuǐ (仲虺) said:
*"To the lost, offer comfort; to the disordered, bring order.
To restore the lost is the way of the state.
You should stabilize Wèi and await the proper time."*
In winter, they assembled at Qí to stabilize Wèi.
This is what is called the **great state’s pacification of lesser states**.

Again, when a great state gathers lesser states,
it means all directions come to pay homage,
without exception.
Thus, Xià Qǐ had the **feast at Jiūntái (钧台)**, in Yùnán.
Shāng Tāng had the **command at Jǐngbó (景亳)**, in Yǎnshī.
Zhōu Wǔ had the **oath at Mèngjīn (孟津)**,
Chéng Wáng had the **search at Qíyáng (岐阳)**,
Kāng Wáng had the **assembly at Tíngguān (酆官)**, in Dū.
Mù Wáng had the **gathering at Túshān (涂山)**, in Shòuchūn.
Qí Huáng had the **army at Shàolíng (邵陵)**,
Jìn Wén had the **alliance at Jiàntǔ (践土)**.
All these were instances where a great state relieved the lesser states,
and each direction found its proper place.

When a great state cannot pacify lesser states,
like the Duke of Jìn who could not nurture the feudal lords
but forced them at Zhèng,
Zhèng’s Zǐ Jiā wrote to Zhào Xuānzǐ (赵宣子):
*"The ancients said:
‘Fearful of the head, fearful of the tail—
what little remains of the body!’
And again:
‘A dying deer does not choose its sound.’
When a lesser state serves a greater one,
if the greater state has virtue, its people will follow;
if it lacks virtue, they will flee like a dying deer.
In desperation, they take risks—
how can they choose when pressed so hard?"*
This means that if Jìn oppressively commands Zhèng,
Zhèng will seek refuge with Chǔ.

When a state’s commands have no bounds,
its ruin is already known—
it will exhaust its tribute to await sudden collapse.
This was the fate of **Chǔ Jìn’s** domain.

To dwell between great states yet submit to coercion—
is this truly a crime?
It arises because great states cannot soothe the hearts of the lesser ones,
and thus provoke rebellion.

Therefore, a great state toward lesser states
should be **humble and yielding**, to win their hearts,
**gentle and tranquil**, to embrace them.

*"Taking"* means **gathering**—
gathering others to oneself.
When lesser states submit to greater ones,
they seek to **take** from the greater ones.
**Annotation:** The greater takes the lesser as subjects and servants;
the lesser takes the greater as **allies and support**.

**Exegesis:** When the sovereign of a great state uses humble submission
to subdue a lesser state,
the sovereign of the lesser state will attend court, pay homage,
and dare not rebel—
offering deference in service to the greater state,
seeking its might as **support**.

**Meaning:** If a lesser state humbly devotes itself with loyalty,
exhausting its respect in serving the greater state,
then the greater state will cherish and pacify it,
soften and subdue it.
But if a lesser state cannot render proper rites or sincerity
in serving the greater state—
as when the people of **Sòng** made the **Lùshàng Alliance**
to seek the **Hé** states’ aid from **Chǔ**,
and **Chǔ** agreed—
**Sòng Gōngzǐ Mùyí** said:
*"A lesser state making alliances—this is disaster.*
**Sòng will surely perish.**"
Fortunately, defeat came later.
At the alliance, Mùyí said:
*"Disaster lies here.*
The ruler’s demands are too extreme—
how can they endure?"
Thus, **Chǔ seized Sòng Gōng**.
In winter, they assembled at **Bó** and released him.
Mùyí said:
*"Not yet.*
This is insufficient to warn the ruler."
This was the case of a lesser state failing to serve a greater one.

But when a lesser state serves a greater one well—
as in **Yǐn Wén Gōng’s** first year, third month,
when **Zhū Yí Fù** made an alliance at **Mì Lǔ**,
**Zhū** being a vassal prince not yet under royal command,
hence its name was recorded—
yet the lesser state could properly attend the greater one,
renewing goodwill and calming the people,
its name was honored in the records.

**Court attendance**—when a great state visits a lesser one as **plenipotentiary**,
it is the greater serving the lesser;
when a lesser state visits a great one as **tribute-bearer**,
it is the lesser serving the greater.
**Renewing goodwill** and **binding trust**—
**consulting on affairs** and **supplementing deficiencies**—
these are the greatest of rites.

**Mèngzǐ** said:
*"Only the virtuous can serve the lesser with the greater,
as **Tāng** served **Gé Bó** and **Wén Wáng** served **Kūn Yí**.*
Only the wise can serve the greater with the lesser,
as **Dà Wáng** served **Xūn Yú** and **Gōu Jiàn** served **Wú**."

Serving the lesser with the greater is called *"rejoicing in Heaven,"*
serving the greater with the lesser is called *"fearing Heaven."*
Those who rejoice in Heaven **preserve the world**,
those who fear Heaven **preserve their state.**

The *Odes* say:
*"Fear Heaven’s fear,#2*
In its time, it preserves [us]."*
This is the *Zhōu Preface* praising **Chéng Wáng**,
who feared Heaven’s might and secured lasting peace.

Thus, sometimes one submits to **take**,
sometimes one submits **and is taken**.
**Annotation:** *"Take"* refers to the greater taking the lesser;
*"and is taken"* refers to the lesser taking the greater.

**Exegesis:** The *Spring and Autumn Annals* says:
*"When an army can maneuver it at will, it is called ‘take.’"*
When one submits to **take**—
the greater state uses humble submission
to **take** the lesser state,
making it obedient in all directions—
hence *"take."*
When one submits **and is taken**—
the lesser state uses humble submission
to serve the greater state,
only able to receive support,
not to command at will—
hence *"and is taken."*

**Meaning:** An army that can maneuver at will—
as in **Lǐzǐ Gōng’s** twenty-sixth autumn,#3
when **Sòng** rebelled against **Chǔ** but aligned with **Jìn**.
**Chǔ**’s **Yīnzhěng** and **Sīmǎ** led troops to attack **Sòng**,
besieging **Mián**.
The **Gōng** used **Chǔ**’s army to attack **Qí**, seizing **Gǔ**.
In general, when an army can maneuver at will, it is called *"take."*
This means advance and retreat are at its command.
**Huan Gōng’s** son **Yōng** was placed in **Gǔ** as a hostage for **Lǔ’s** support.
**Chǔ**’s **Shēn Gōng** secured the alliance.
**Huan Gōng’s** seven sons became **Chǔ’s** great ministers,
because **Qí Xiàogōng** could not pacify them.
In the twenty-eighth year, **Chǔzǐ** sent **Shēn Shū** to release **Gǔ**.
This shows maneuvering is at one’s disposal,
and taking or releasing is as circumstances demand.

A great state seeks only to **nurture and dominate** others,
a lesser state seeks only to **enter and serve** others.
**Annotation:** When a great state humbly submits to the lesser,
it seeks only to **nurture and dominate** the lesser as subjects and servants.
When a lesser state presents tribute and submits to the greater,
it seeks only to **enter and serve** the greater for support.

**Exegesis:** The great state, through humble virtue, submits to the lesser,
seeking nothing more than to **nurture and dominate** the lesser as its subjects,
as its sovereign’s vassals.
The lesser state, through humble offerings and tribute,
seeks only to **enter and serve** the greater state,
to gain its support.

**Meaning:** The great state takes the lesser as subjects and servants,
the lesser state takes the greater as allies and support.
These are the two ultimate intentions.

*"Upshot"* means **offering**,
*"tribute"* means **presenting**,
*"currency"* means **silk**.
When princes pay homage to the **Sovereign**,
or states exchange envoys,
they must **display** jade, silk, and goods,
**hold them as rites**—
hence *"accreditation and tribute."*

When a lesser state seeks the greater’s support—
as in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, **Wén Gōng’s** fourteenth autumn,#4
when **Zhēng Bó** and **Lǔ Gōng** feasted at **Cuī**,
**Zhēng’s** minister **Guī Shēng** recited *"Hóng Yàn"*,
taking its meaning of **pitying widows and orphans**
to move **Lǔ Hóu** to compassion.
He also recited *"Zǎi Chí"*’s four chapters,
speaking of **Zhēng’s** weakness,
taking its meaning that a lesser state in distress
seeks to draw the greater state as support.

Both sides thus obtain what they desire,
hence the greater should **humble itself**.
**Annotation:** One seeks subjects and servants,
the other seeks allies and support—
both obtain what they desire.
Yet great states must always guard against arrogance,
hence it is said the greater should **humble itself**.

**Exegesis:** The great desires to **nurture and dominate**,
the lesser desires to **enter and serve**—
both fulfill their wishes,
hence *"each obtains what they desire."*

The greater must **humble itself** before the lesser,
for though things are commonly light when small and heavy when great,
it is inevitable that the great will **overwhelm** the small—
lest the ruler of a great state grow arrogant from strength and invite calamity,
few being able to **submit to submission**.

Thus, the great are warned to **practice humility** above all.

**Annotation:** The great must **humble itself**—
this is the Way of **concealing virtue** and **nurturing weakness**.

**Exegesis:** Even to stand above an ordinary man is difficult.
How much more so to rule over a state?
One who governs must **align with Heaven and Earth**,
**comfort the people and harmonize the populace**,
not **exalt oneself** because of the state’s grandeur,
nor **rely on strength** because of its mighty arms.
Let **humility and gentleness** be one’s resolve,
let **caution and reverence** dwell in one’s heart—
like walking on thin ice,
or guiding a rotting rope,
with **vigilant diligence**,
**solemnly respecting** the **mysterious Dao**,
and thus one may **preserve their realm**.

The **Laozi** feared that **relying on strength** would lead to ruin,
hence he **especially warned** against this.

For those who govern their own bodies,
it is to **avoid arrogance in wealth and power**,
to **guard against fullness and excess** in governance,
and to **restrain oneself and moderate desires**,
so that one may **attain a peaceful end**.

If a great state cannot **humble itself**,
it may **indulge in extravagance** or **display insolence**,
and the people will **forsake it**.
King **Jie of Xia** held the **Rúyīng Assembly**,
and the people **rebelled** against him;
King **Zhòu of Shang** held the **Líhunting Expedition**,
and the **Eastern barbarians rebelled**;
King **Yōu of Zhou** held the **Tàishì Alliance**,
and the **Róng and Yí tribes rebelled**;
Duke **Shuāng of Sòng** held the **Assembly at Lùshàng**,
and the **feudal lords rebelled**;
King **Zǐ of Chu** held the **Assembly at Shēn**,
and the **people’s hearts turned away**.

One who **harbors resentment** does not **win loyalty with virtue**,
one who **relaxes discipline** does not **secure obedience with rites**—
how can such a ruler **expect submission**?

**Dao** is the **ultimate mystery** of all things. **(Chapter 62 of *Dàodéjīng*)**

**Exegesis:** The previous chapter showed that **virtue/power** can **draw down** others,
so that both great and small **fulfill their desires**.
This chapter reveals that **Dao/Way** can **transform and govern** all things,
so that both good and evil **are encompassed by its influence**.

First, it **proclaims the essence of Dao**.
Next, it **illustrates the establishment of teaching** to transform people.
Finally, it **lamented the ancient rulers’ neglect of Dao’s function**,
which can truly be called **the most noble of all**.

**Annotation:** **Noble**—this means **revered and exalted**.
**Exegesis:** Dao is the **mysterious essence** of all things,
**the source from which they draw their origin**.
Hence it is called the **ultimate mystery** of all things.

**Mystery** means **the inner realm**—
**Dao** contains all without exclusion,
**encompassing** all as their **origin and foundation**.
Thus it is the **ultimate mystery** of all things.

The *Xīshēng Jīng* states:
*"Dao is profound and most mysterious,
the abyss of the void and formless."*

This is precisely what is meant.

**Exegesis:** The **depth of Dao** is such that it **swallows all** and **encompasses all**.
The **height of the dome** and the **breadth of the earth**,
the **illumination of the sun and moon**,
the **flourishing of the living and the growing**—
all are **nurtured by Dao’s qi**,
dwelling within the **Great Dao**,
hence it is the **ultimate mystery** of all things.

The *Xīshēng Jīng* is the **Laozi’s** teaching
given in the **25th year of King Zhāo of Zhou (癸丑)**,
in the **4th month**,
at **Yīnxí’s grass hut** in the **shadow of Zhōngnán Mountain**,
after **delivering the two *Dàodé* Scriptures**.
Then, **to transform the Western lands** and **pacify the drifting sands**,
Yīnxí asked about **the method of preserving the Three Treasures** and **one’s essence**,
and the **essentials of Dao practice and self-cultivation**.
Later, he **compiled and recorded** these **sacred words**,
and **ascended to Tàiwēi**—
the **meaning of transforming the Western lands** and **pacifying the drifting sands**.

The *Xīshēng Jīng* consists of **36 chapters**,
**972 sentences**,
and **4,278 words**.
Its **core meaning** aligns with the *Dàodéjīng*,
stating that the **Great Dao is profound and mysterious**,
the **haven of the void and formless**.

The **treasure of the virtuous**—
**Annotation:** The virtuous know that those who **guard Dao** flourish,
while those who **lose Dao** perish,
hence they **reverence and cherish** it without **suffering harm**.

**Exegesis:** **Treasure** means **precious and valued**.
The **virtuous** embody **Dao’s effortless action**,
their **body and mind pure and tranquil**,
hence they **reverence and cherish Dao** without **ever forgetting it**.

**Exegesis:** The virtuous **reflect on Dao** and **harmonize their hearts**,
thus they **constantly cherish Dao**.

Zǐhǎn said:
*"Men value jade as treasure,
I value **non-greed** as treasure."*
And for rulers who govern their states,
**virtue** is their treasure—
how much more so for the virtuous,
whose hearts **never forsake Dao**,
thus **Dao itself is their treasure**.

The **treasure that the unvirtuous cannot guard**—
**Annotation:** **Guard** means **to rely upon**.
The unvirtuous **cannot treasure Dao**,
and when **calamity befalls**,
they **seek to rely on Dao with their bodies**,
**praying for deliverance**.

**Exegesis:** **Guard** means **to rely upon** or **lean upon**.
The unvirtuous **lack wisdom**,
**bewildered by their habits**.
In times of ease, they **neglect Dao**,
but when **disaster strikes**, they **turn to it with their bodies**,
**relying on Dao** to **seek safety**.

**Exegesis:** The unvirtuous **act contrary to teaching**,
thus they are **far from Dao**.
Even if they **seek to guard their bodies** and **rely on Dao**,
to **resolve difficulties** and **save peril**,
they **cannot succeed**.

The Scripture also says:
*"The treasure that the unvirtuous do not guard"*—
meaning the unvirtuous **violate Dao**,
hence they **do not treasure Dao**.

**Why?** Dao **loves gentleness and weakness**,
but the unvirtuous **love strength and hardness**;
Dao **loves tranquility and harmony**,
but the unvirtuous **love rigidity and agitation**;
Dao **loves emptiness and stillness**,
but the unvirtuous **love noise and clamor**;
Dao **loves humility and lowliness**,
but the unvirtuous **love defiance and resistance**;
Dao **loves non-action**,
but the unvirtuous **love scheming and interference**;
Dao **loves life and creation**,
but the unvirtuous **love destruction and harm**.

Their **actions contradict Dao**,
hence the unvirtuous **do not treasure Dao**.

**Sweet words can earn honor**,
**noble deeds can elevate others**—
**Annotation:** If one **makes their words sweet and pleasing**,
they can **seek honor through exchange**;
if one **raises their conduct**,
they can **add to others’ virtue**.
This is like the **sage’s** offering of **sweet and refined Dao-teaching**,
and **exalted, tranquil conduct**,
to **transform the unvirtuous**—
just as merchants **sell goods** and the people **follow in obedience**.

Hence the following text says:

「**Exegesis:** This is a parable in explanation.
It means that even the unvirtuous are included within the scope of teaching.
**Elucidation:** The Dao’s words are plain and unadorned,
lacking sweetness and appeal—
how could the unvirtuous ever take delight in them?
Thus, the sage employs sweet words to entice them,
and those who follow are like merchants flocking to the market for profit.
The sage demonstrates noble and elevated conduct to transform them,
and those who respond are like travelers drawn to fragrance and returning in reverence.
Through this transformation, even the unvirtuous refine themselves,
all becoming practitioners of the Dao—
this is the saying that **"the Dao does not abandon anyone."**
How could the unvirtuous be abandoned?
**Elucidation:** Even when people’s words and deeds are unvirtuous,
how could they be abandoned?
They should be guided by the good Dao,
hoping they will follow the teaching and abandon their evil ways—
one cannot abandon them without first transforming them.
Hence the saying: **"How could they be abandoned?"**
**Elucidation:** The sage’s benevolence is vast,
the Dao does not cast aside any being.
Though the unvirtuous may be unvirtuous,
pitying their lack of understanding of the Dao,
the sage offers sweet words to entice them,
good teachings to encourage them,
leading them toward virtue without abandoning any.
**悛 (quān)**, means to change.
Thus, the institution of the Son of Heaven and the Three Ministers is established.
**Elucidation:** To collectively teach the unvirtuous.
**Exegesis:** Thus, the Three Ministers are appointed—
namely, the Grand Teacher, the Grand Tutor, and the Grand Guardian.
The Son of Heaven practices non-action,
while the Three Ministers expound the Dao,
all methods to impart instruction and establish teaching,
transforming the unvirtuous.
The *Book of Documents* says: **"The workings of Heaven, and humans follow in response."**
This is the very meaning.
**Elucidation:**」

The vastness of the Four Seas,
the abundance of all things,
when humans first emerged,
they could not lack a sovereign,
so the Son of Heaven is established to nurture them.
The Son of Heaven,
revering the Supreme Dao,
serves Heaven as a father,
serves Earth as a mother,
is called the Son of Heaven.

One person cannot govern broadly,
so the Hundred Officials are appointed to oversee them.
Among the Hundred Officials,
the Three Ministers hold the highest rank.
The *Book of Documents* and *Zhou Officials* state:
**"It is the Three Ministers who expound the Dao and guide the state."**

The Grand Teacher,
wise enough to be a wellspring of knowledge,
conducting enough to serve as a model,
when consulted, responds appropriately,
when sought, yields results.
He is called the Grand Teacher,
also known as the Grand Father.
*Tai* signifies greatness,
and he is the teacher of the king.
He rides in a **carriage of state** with green canopy,
wears a **golden seal and purple sash**.

The Grand Tutor,
teaches and safeguards.
The *Greater Dai Li* says:
**"He instructs the Son of Heaven in virtue and righteousness."**
If the Son of Heaven
lacks filial piety toward his parents,
shows no kindness to the common people,
offends the great ministers,
or fails in the administration of justice,
then the Grand Tutor has neglected his duty.

The Grand Guardian,
safeguards, supports, and bears responsibility.
The *Greater Dai Li* says:
**"If the Son of Heaven occupies his position improperly,
receives the classics without reverence,
speaks without proper tone,
his music does not conform to the laws,
and his movements lack the rites of respectful elevation and lowering,
then the Grand Guardian has neglected his duty."**

Additionally, there are the Three Assistants—
the Grand Marshal, the Grand Minister of Instruction, and the Grand Minister of Works,
who help the Son of Heaven govern **yin and yang**,
personally serve the people,
and promote teachings and transformations.
This is their role.

The *Book of Documents* (in the **□ Caoyu Mó** section) says:
**"One day, two days, myriad affairs—
do not neglect the Hundred Officials,
for humans must follow Heaven’s work."**
*Edang* means to leave empty,
*shu* means the multitude.
The one who holds the position must be the right person;
if not, then the office is left vacant.
This means that humans should govern in Heaven’s stead,
but they cannot use Heaven’s offices for private gain,
nor employ those unfit for the task.

Even if one presents
a **jewel of great worth** (拱璧)
and a **team of four fine horses** (先驷马),
it is not as valuable as
sitting and offering this Dao of non-action.
**Elucidation:** Even the Three Ministers, though they assist the Son of Heaven,
would find that even presenting a jewel of great worth
and a team of four fine horses as tribute
is still not as precious as
sitting and offering this Dao of non-action,
so that the transformations of evil to virtue may take place.

The **jewel of great worth** and the **team of four fine horses**,
in ancient times,
when nobles paid homage to the Son of Heaven,
or when states held assemblies,
the lesser state would present tribute first—
a jewel as the guide,
followed by a team of four horses.
This is why it is called *xian* (先).
The *Spring and Autumn Annals* records cases like
the **Wei carriage leading twelve oxen** (乘韦先牛十二)
to entertain the troops.

**Elucidation:** *Hequan* (合拱) means,
as the *Shuo Wen* says,
two hands clasped together as a gesture of respect.
*Bi* (璧) is a **auspicious jade**.
A **jewel of great worth** refers to the largest jade presented.
*Si che* (驷马) means four horses harnessed together,
driving a single carriage.
In ancient times,
when nobles paid homage to the Son of Heaven,
or when states held assemblies at great or lesser courts,
or met in the wild,
when two rulers faced each other,
they would exchange gifts of tribute.
The first gift presented was called *xian* (先).
Now, the Three Ministers should focus on
expounding the Dao and guiding the state.
Though they might wish to present
a **team of four fine horses** and a **jewel of great worth** to the Son of Heaven,
such gifts only encourage excess and luxury,
but do not aid in governance or administration.
It is better to offer this Dao of non-action and tranquility,
so that it may transform the world.
Let the unvirtuous follow virtue,
let the unrepentant change their hearts—
when the Dao’s transformations spread far and wide,
the Son of Heaven’s virtue reaches everywhere.
What need is there for such gifts as the **jewel of great worth** and the **team of four fine horses**?

*Fuxiang* (辅相) means
to **support and assist**.
It also means
to **observe their virtues and vices**.
The Son of Heaven takes the **Four Assistants constellation** as a model
for establishing his ministers of support and assistance,
to correct his deficiencies,
to uphold proper rites,
to guide him with morality,
and to aid him with governance and transformation.

The **Wei carriage leading twelve oxen** (乘韦先牛十二),
as recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals* during Duke Li of the Lu State, thirty-third year:
The Jin army attacked Zheng,
and reached the city of Hao.
A Zheng merchant named Xian Gao,
who was selling goods in the Zhou state,
encountered them on the way.
He presented a **Wei carriage** (乘韦) as the guide,
followed by twelve oxen (牛十二),
to entertain the troops, saying:
**"My humble lord heard that your forces were about to march through our state,
and I dared to offer this small tribute to those who follow you.
Though I cannot afford much in gifts,
I can provide one day’s worth of provisions for those who stop,
and one night’s worth of guard for those who move on.
Moreover, I will send an urgent message to Zheng,
so that they may be prepared."**

The ancients honored this Dao for what reason?
*Note: "何" as an interrogative particle.*

*Commentary:* To establish trust in the present by citing the past.

The ancients refer to those who previously treasured this Dao.
Why did they value it so?
*Commentary:* "Why?"—to inquire into the reason for cherishing this Dao.

A single *archer’s jade* is not enough to make it precious,
A team of *four horses* cannot suffice to make it rare.
From antiquity to the present,
Only what is precious in the Dao—why?

The *Laozi* sought to illuminate the Dao’s efficacy:
To harmonize and bring peace to Heaven and Earth,
To align and assist the states and families.
Practicing it brings order,
Defying it brings chaos.
He emphasized its profound benefit to all beings.

Now, further questioning why the ancients honored this Dao:
Is it because it cannot be daily sought yet obtained,
Or because it can absolve one of guilt?

Therefore, it is honored by all under Heaven.
*Note: The Dao lies in enlightenment, not in seeking. Unlike wealth, which can be daily sought and acquired, hence it cannot be "daily sought yet obtained." Once enlightened, there is no burden of guilt—why would one seek release from guilt only after committing it? Thus, it is truly worthy of all under Heaven’s honor.*

*Commentary:* This response elucidates why the Dao is precious.
The phrase "not daily sought yet obtained" means
That the Dao lies in enlightenment,
And enlightenment arises from clarity of mind—
Not like the methods of deliberate action,
Where one calculates days and years,
Striving and scheming to attain it.
But when the heart is pure and worldly thoughts are stilled,
The natural luminosity of truth emerges.
Thus, it is said, "not daily sought yet obtained."

As for "absolve one of guilt,"—
When deluded thoughts arise and defilements cling,
The karmic burden naturally follows.
If one attains enlightenment through the Dao,
And the heart is pure and empty,
Then the cause of guilt is extinguished.
How could it be like the stubborn-minded,
Who, at every movement, generate regret and remorse,
Entangled by guilt and punishment,
Only then seeking release?

For this reason,
It is treasured by all virtuous under Heaven.

*Commentary:* The Dao is precious to all under Heaven
Because one attains it through sudden enlightenment,
Not through striving and seeking.
Once deluded thoughts are dispelled,
One naturally enters the true Dao.
With deluded thoughts removed,
The defilements of worldly concerns also vanish.
Thus, one can obtain it,
And be freed from guilt—
Hence, it is universally cherished.

The *Laozi* spoke of the Dao’s profound and mysterious nature,
For few are those who truly comprehend it.
He posed this question to praise and clarify,
Hoping they would attain enlightenment.

Moreover, he addressed those who still cling to worldly studies,
Who value a single *archer’s jade* more than a moment of precious time.
Would the sovereign of the Dao not exalt the wondrous and subtle roots of virtue,
And instead revere those trifling, clamorous, and material things?

For the Chapter on *Non-Action* (Chapter 63) – *Commentary*:
The preceding chapter expounds the wondrous origins of the Dao’s profundity,
And the path of seated enlightenment as the gate to the *auxiliary ministers*.
This chapter elucidates the silent, effortless *Non-Action*,
And the cultivation of tranquility to extinguish resentment.
First, it marks the practice of *seated-forgetting* and severing desire,
Then demonstrates how to avert calamities by preventing their sprouts.
Finally, it illustrates the sovereign’s virtue through the *Way*,
To conclude and exhort thee.

**Meaning:**
Before, through not esteeming *archer’s jade* or *fine steeds*,
It advanced the Dao as the source of *cosmic transformation*,
And declared that sudden enlightenment leads to the *Mystic*—
The *Mystic* being without blame.
This is the *Non-Action* of *Non-Action*,
The savoring of the Dao in its unchanging constancy,
Naturally free of grievance or reproach,
For virtue’s reward is enduring, not the toil of trifling excess.
Thus, in harmony with the Dao, there is no transgression.

This exhorts the ruler to honor the Dao
And embody *Non-Action*,
To lead by example and magnify *purity and stillness*.

**Non-Action is Action,**
**Non-Affair is Affair,**
**Non-Savor is Savor.**
*Commentary*:
**Action**—here, *crafting*.
The cultivator of the Dao,
Through *seated-forgetting* and abandoning desire,
Has a mind that crafts nothing.
Whatever they undertake,
Their works align with *cosmic transformation*—
Not *doing* yet *doing*,
Hence called *Non-Action*.
This clarifies the mind.

They cling not to affairs,
Hence in affairs there is *Non-Affair*—
This clarifies the body.

They indulge not in tastes,
Hence in tastes there is *Non-Savor*—
This clarifies the speech.

The Three *Karmas* purified,
Then the Six *Senses*’ dust naturally subsides.

**Meaning:**
Mankind’s inherent nature,
From birth, comprises the Three *Karmas*.
The *Karma of the mind* arises,
With utility yet no form—
All deeds originate in the mind.
*Non-Action* purifies the *Karma of the mind*.

The *Karma of the body* arises,
With utility yet substance—
Affairs undertaken bind to the body.
*Non-Affair* purifies the *Karma of the body*.

The *Karma of speech* arises,
With words and tastes—
The known tastes are not the Dao’s speech,
But spring from the mouth.
*Non-Savor* and *forgetting speech* purify the *Karma of speech*.

Once the Three *Karmas* are abandoned,
All dust subsides of itself.
Dust clears, stillness prevails,
Lips seal the true Dao—
This is the cultivator’s practice.

The ruler who governs by *Non-Action*,
Does not cling to *crafting*,
Thus the three seasons are unobstructed,
And the myriad folk untroubled—
*Leaning on the lintel, holding the map*,
They transcend in ease and repose.

The one who *Non-Affairs*
Does not toil in labor or war,
Seeks no *jade terrace* or *palace of pearls* in splendor,
No *Hall of Eternal Tranquility* or *Tiger’s Mound* in grandeur—
Then, in humble halls of thatch and wood,
Human effort is preserved.

The one who *Non-Savors*
Does not indulge in wine or delicacies,
Lives freely, fulfilling their nature,
Preserves life on land and water,
Finds contentment in simple fare—
This is the way of *Non-Savor*.

The one who *forgets speech*
Upright in form, transforming below,
Issues commands without vexation,
Unassuming yet all is transformed—
Thus, they accord with the *Non-Action* of the Dao.

Great or small, many or few,
Virtue alone repays resentment.
*Annotation*:
In *Non-Action* there is Action,
In *Non-Affair* there is Affair,
In *Non-Savor* there is Savor.

If great and small, many and few,
Do not exceed their bounds,
Then no resentment arises.
If one follows the *sense-fields* and stirs the mind,
Violating boundaries and harming nature,
Then great and small alike become resentment’s match.
Now, since they guard their bounds and preserve harmony,
This is the repayment of resentment with virtue.

*Commentary*:
Greatness and smallness, many and few,
If they touch the *sense-fields* of *Action*,
Are naught but the vastness of resentment’s foes.
If one embodies *Non-Action*,
Abandons these desires,
Realizes the true and actual,
And quells the mind of arising and ceasing,
Then resentment’s foes do not arise—
This is the repayment of resentment with virtue.

**Meaning:**
The ruler, in *Non-Action* yet *Action*,
In *Non-Affair* yet *Affair*,
Serene and self-satisfied,
Alone wanders with the Dao,
Below, no grievances or queries,
At the borders, no arms or armor.
Should any dare to rebel,
They must be tamed of their own accord—
*Dance with the dry bones and the withered branches,*
And the *Miao* tribes will submit.
This is the repayment of resentment with virtue.

The cultivator of the self,
With the Three *Karmas* purified,
No evils arise,
No things can intrude—
How could resentment or anger take root?
Since resentment and anger are nonexistent,
They devote themselves wholly to *purity and emptiness*—
This too is the repayment of resentment with virtue.

**Difficult things must be addressed when they are easy,**
**Great things must be undertaken when they are small.**
*Annotation*:
To clarify the prior admonition to preemptive planning.

*Commentary*:
**Address**—here, *plan and resolve*.
**Undertake**—here, *pursue*.
Passion and desire harm nature,
All arise gradually—
No difficulty is not first easy,
No greatness is not first small.
If one plans to address difficulty when it is already difficult,
And undertakes greatness when it is already great,
Then calamity has already taken form—
Even if they plan and act thereafter,
It will avail nothing against the calamity.

**Meaning:**
*Non-Affair* and *Non-Action*
Naturally avoid great and difficult things.
They extinguish the mind’s stirrings before they arise,
And thus do not await suppression when small and easy—
This is to clarify the mind and *cosmic transformation*,
To attain tranquility and steadfastness.

**Difficult things must arise from ease,**
**Great things must arise from smallness.**
*Annotation*:
To explain the prior admonition on preemptive planning.

*Commentary*:
**Arise**—here, *begin*.
This follows the prior text,
To trace the origins of calamity.
Difficult things must begin in ease,
Thus they should be addressed while still easy.
Great things must begin in smallness,
Thus they should be extinguished while still small.
Their kinds are indeed manifold,
Too numerous to enumerate—
Hence the summary: *all difficult things under heaven, all great things under heaven*.

**Meaning:**
To prevent calamity before its signs appear,
To extinguish it before its sprouts arise—
This is the utmost caution.
Calamities are born from slight neglect,
Disasters from subtle beginnings.
If one guards against them early,
How could great or difficult calamities ever manifest?

The general phrase *all under heaven*
Is meant to prompt both action and inaction in guarding against the subtle.

Thus, the Sage never undertakes what is great,
And so is able to achieve greatness.
*Annotation*:
Since it was said that *great things must arise from smallness*,
This explains how the Sage can achieve greatness—
By not undertaking what is difficult or great,
They thus fulfill their *august and grand* purpose.

The *Commentary* explains that ordinary people commonly undertake difficult and great matters, thus incurring many failures and calamities. Therefore, it is said that the Sage never undertakes difficult or great matters, and thus achieves the august and grand.

**Meaning:**
Ordinary people are led astray by circumstances, their thoughts drift into error, and when difficult matters arise, their faults cannot be erased; when great matters arise, their crimes cannot be absolved. The Sage comprehends the emptiness of illusion and penetrates the eternal truth, thus never engaging in what is great or difficult, and so attains the august and grand.

Light promises lead to few fulfilled words,
Many reckless actions bring many calamities.
**Annotation:**
Lightly promising others leads to few fulfilled words;
Acting recklessly in many things brings later calamities.

**Commentary:**
This concludes with an analogy.
Those who speak without threefold consideration,
Lightly agreeing without thought,
Will surely lack loyalty and trustworthiness.
Those who do not plan the beginning but are cautious at the end,
Who undertake many reckless deeds,
Will later generate calamities and burdens.

**Meaning:**
Before establishing oneself, loyalty and trustworthiness are paramount.
To remain steadfast as one begins,
No calamity can intrude.
If one lightly promises others,
Or recklessly undertakes deeds,
The burdens of calamity will surely follow—
This is indeed the natural order.

Thus, the Sage resolves to avoid such errors,
And so never encounters difficulty.
**Annotation:**
Difficulty arises from light promises and reckless actions,
Thus the Sage never encounters difficult or great matters.

**Commentary:**
The Sage refers to the enlightened ruler.
He hesitates over light promises and reckless actions,
And so never undertakes difficult or great matters.

**Meaning:**
The enlightened ruler and the cultivated scholar
Do not bind themselves to light promises,
Maintaining stillness and following the constant Way.
They do not indulge in reckless desires,
Remaining serene and harmonious in response to things.
Thus, in governance, all are sincerely convinced;
In conduct, they avoid external faults and excesses,
Self-eliminating the flaws of difficulty and greatness,
And aligning with the Dao of *wuwei*.

**On the ease of maintaining stillness and restraint (Chapter 64)**

**Commentary:**
The previous chapter expounds the difficulty of *wuwei* and silent mystery,
Illustrating the path to quelling resentment and cultivating the Dao.
This chapter elucidates preemptive foresight and prevention,
Marking the conduct of severing emotions and desires.

The first six sentences repeatedly clarify the gradual nature of preventing calamities.
The next six sentences cite analogies for the origins of calamities.
Two sentences then discuss the delusion of attachment.
Six more sentences contrast ordinary conduct.
The final seven sentences expound the Sage’s reluctance to act and the ease of ordinary people’s scheming.

**Meaning:**
The previous chapter warns against the difficulty of twofold action,
Thus avoiding calamities and burdens.
This chapter now clarifies the fourfold ease of conduct,
Urging meticulous cultivation and guarding against the slightest errors,
Abandoning attachment and delusion,
To exemplify the Sage’s conduct and block the common people’s transgressions.
When all desires are eliminated and noble affections remain unstained,
This fulfills the intent of the next chapter: *Goodness is the Dao itself*.

**On the ease of maintaining stillness and restraint:**

**Commentary:**
*An* (安) means stillness; *chi* (持) means restraint.
Humans, upon receiving life, possess an innate purity and stillness,
But when moved by external things, they chase desires endlessly.
Now, when desire has not yet arisen,
And one is in a state of tranquil stillness,
If one guards it and restrains it,
Preventing it from scattering and becoming disordered,
Then restraint becomes easy.
Thus, it is said: *Its stillness is easy to maintain.*

**Meaning:**
The innate nature is tranquil and still,
Desires not yet having sprouted.
If one attends to it and restrains it,
Holding fast becomes effortless.
To sever the firm ice at the first sign of frost—
This is naturally not difficult.
To return to the uncarved block before the wheels are mounted—
The simplicity is still visible.
It depends on cultivation and refinement,
And the preservation of the eternal truth.

Those moved by external things—
This is the language of the *Rites of Zhou, Music Canon*.

**On its incipient state being easy to plan:**

**Annotation:**
When one is in a state of innate stillness,
And desires have not yet taken form,
If one plans and measures to eliminate them,
Preventing their very rise,
This is indeed very easy.

**Commentary:**
*Fu* (兆) means the gradual emergence of a tendency.
*Mou* (谋) means to plan and measure.
When desire is about to arise but has not yet shown signs,
Planning to eliminate it is also very easy.
Thus, it is said: *Its incipient state is easy to plan.*

**Meaning:**
When desire is about to sprout but has not yet taken form,
Planning to eliminate it—
Its ease is evident.
Yet clarity lies in discerning the subtle,
And power lies in suppressing desire.
To discern and suppress—
No greater virtue exists.

**On its fragility being easy to shatter:**

**Commentary:**
When desire has already stirred but remains soft and fragile,
If one seeks to eliminate it,
It is easy to break and disperse.

**Meaning:**
When desire’s signs are already apparent but have not yet hardened,
To attack the soft and shatter the fragile—
This is not difficult in principle.
It depends on sincere self-discipline and clarity,
Restoring purity and simplicity.

**On its subtlety being easy to disperse:**

**Annotation:**
When desire first takes root, it remains perilously fragile.
Those who can eliminate it—
Its fragility makes it easy to break.
When calamities first arise, their signs are still subtle.
If one seeks to prevent them,
Their subtlety makes them easy to disperse.

**Commentary:**
*Wei* (微) means subtle.
When calamities are still subtle and have not yet grown great,
If one prevents them at their onset,
Dissolving them is also very easy.

**Meaning:**
When desire has already solidified but the matter remains subtle,
To suppress emotions and disperse them,
To curb desire and arrange them properly,
To purify thoughts and cleanse the heart—
The Dao is not far off.

The preceding four sentences collectively illuminate the conduct of preventing the subtle.
They state that governing the state and cultivating oneself
Requires prioritizing the prevention of calamities and forethought of disasters.
When calamities have formed and must be remedied,
When disasters have arisen and must be attacked,
The effort is greater, yet the calamities remain unresolved.

**To act before they manifest:**

**Annotation:**
This reverses the earlier statements on ease of maintaining and planning.
The reason it is easy is that one acts to prevent them
Before they take form or show signs.

**Commentary:**
*Wei* (为) means to cultivate and eliminate.
This sentence elucidates the earlier statements on ease of maintaining and planning.
The reason it is easy is that one cultivates and eliminates desires
Before they arise or take form.

**Meaning:**
*Wei* (为) means to prevent beforehand.
Though it reverses the explanation of ease of maintaining,
It also elaborates on the principle of preventing beforehand.

「The *Wenxuan* (文选) poem states: *"The junzi (君子) prevents what has not yet occurred,"*
This is what is called **preventing calamities and avoiding suspicions**.

**To remedy before chaos arises:**
*Annotation:*
This reverses the earlier statements on ease of breaking and dispersing.
The reason it is easy is that one eliminates what has not yet become calamity or disorder.

*Commentary:*
This sentence elucidates the earlier statements on ease of breaking and dispersing.
The reason it is easy is that, though desires and evils may exist,
They are still fragile and weak, not yet having formed into calamity or disorder,
Hence the principle of ease is clear.

*Meaning:*
**To remedy (理)** means to rescue and rectify.
When desires arise, they disrupt the upright nature (正性),
And the upright nature, once restored, is the primary remedy.
Once the remedy is understood, calamities and disorders cease.
Though this reverses the explanation of ease of breaking and dispersing,
It also retains the essence of rescuing and rectifying.

These six sentences apply to the **self**:
As desires grow gradually, the path of cultivation and mastery lies in
Severing desires and defying emotions,
Averting calamities and eliminating disasters—this is the way.

When applied to the **state (国)**:
Safety must not forget danger—this is maintaining ease.
Order must not forget disorder—this is remedying before chaos.
Anticipate calamities in their hidden stages—this is acting before they manifest.
Guard against disasters in their subtle beginnings—this is dispersing what is minute.
Prevent sprouts and stop gradual growth—this is planning when signs are not yet apparent.
Nurture small virtues and eliminate small vices—this is breaking what is fragile.

Do not neglect small virtues as insignificant and fail to cultivate them,
Nor dismiss small vices as harmless and fail to remove them.
These six principles are indeed the essentials for governing the state.

A tree thick enough to encircle with both arms begins as a tiny sprout (毫末),
A nine-tiered tower rises from a single basket of soil (累土),
A journey of a thousand *li* (千里) begins with a single step (足下).
*Annotation:*
These three examples illustrate the consequences of not acting early,
Leading to later afflictions.

*Commentary:*
This speaks of disasters arising from subtleties,
Yet growing when left unchecked.
Like a tree beginning as a fine hair's tip—this shows their origin in inherent nature.
A nine-tiered high platform starts with a single basket of earth—this shows their formation through accumulated habits.
A thousand-*li* distant journey starts with raising one's foot—this shows their progression from near to far.

Thus, all matters under heaven truly begin with subtleties,
Yet people often neglect them, allowing them to become the root of disasters.
Hence, these three analogies are presented to confirm the preceding text.

*Meaning:*
The reason people fail to prevent disasters,
And states fail to guard against subtleties,
Is that they only address calamities after they have formed,
And only remedy disorders after they have taken shape—
This is all far too late.

From a sprout to a tree thick enough to encircle with both arms,
From small to great.
From a single basket of earth to a nine-tiered tower,
From low to high.
From a single step to a thousand-*li* journey,
From near to far.

When people see only the greatness of the encircled tree,
The height of the layered tower,
The vastness of the thousand-*li* journey,
They then wish to grasp the axe to fell it,
To gather tools to demolish it,
To gallop in pursuit to catch it—
Their labor is indeed great.

Yet calamities cannot be saved, like
Leaning against the capital gate and long sighing—
Ultimately leading to the chaos of the Jin Dynasty (晋朝);
Or bowing to the sand and deer, leaving gifts for the Xiongnu (祆)—
Almost toppling the Han Empire (汉室).

Silent understanding and distant foresight (默识远鉴) are indeed worthy of careful attention.

**To act (为) is to court failure; to grasp (执) is to court loss.**

The annotations and commentaries on the *Way* state:

*"All emotions cannot follow their natural course; when one schemes beyond one’s proper nature, and strives to achieve external matters, disaster will inevitably follow. In affairs, one cannot neglect to let go—every action breeds attachment, and where attachment seeks possession, loss is certain.*

*The commentaries explain: ‘For’ (为) refers to scheming; ‘executing’ (执) refers to attachment. It means that people cannot act before things arise or prevent disorder before it occurs, yet still scheme beyond their inherent nature and cling to the dust of the world—thus they court ruin and loss.*

*The meaning is: People do not understand the *Dao*, yet recklessly act and scheme. If one schemes contrary to the *Dao*, collapse is inevitable. Some cling to teachings, fixating on existence and nonexistence, unable to trust in spontaneity or abide by their true nature. Where there is attachment, there is loss; where there is scheming, there is failure. This is the natural order.*

*To make the sovereign of transformation act without scheming is to avoid failure; to make the cultivator of the *Dao* abandon attachment is to avoid loss. Thus, the Sage acts without scheming and so avoids failure; holds no attachment and so avoids loss.*

*The commentaries explain: The Sage remains still and unforced, thus preserving their innate nature whole and avoiding failure; empty and unattached, their true essence remains ever-present and they avoid loss.*

*The meaning is: The Sage knows that scheming defies the *Dao*, so without scheming, there is no failure; knows that attachment betrays the true self, so without attachment, there is no loss. Thus, they quiet their mind in silent stillness, merging with the *Dao*. Since the *Dao* values emptiness and stillness, those who cultivate it must embody the Sage’s heart—serene, tranquil, without thought or deliberation, without scheming or action—only then does the empty chamber birth the pure.*

*When the people engage in affairs, they often fail just as success nears.*

*The annotations explain: When people first undertake good deeds, they often fail just as they near completion.*

*The commentaries explain: ‘Near’ (几) means ‘close.’ It says that common folk, when following good deeds, often achieve near-success but cannot guard the end, thus inviting failure.*

*The meaning is: The world is tumultuous, and true heart is hard to preserve. Lusts and desires ensnare, and the subtle *Dao* is easily forgotten. One begins with earnest effort but falters in retreat, falling into confusion. This stems from scheming and attachment—thus, failure comes at the brink of completion. If one remains as vigilant at the end as at the beginning, there will be no failure.*

*The annotations explain: If one guards the end as carefully as the beginning, maintaining constancy from start to finish, their affairs will never fail.*

*The commentaries explain: This is Laozi’s repeated admonition. If people can treat the end as they did the beginning, remaining consistent throughout, their affairs will never fail.*

*The *Odes* say: ‘None lack a beginning, but few achieve the end.’*

*The meaning is: Those who cultivate the *Dao* cannot commit their hearts to it, yet scheme beyond their nature. Where there is attachment, the true self is lost; where there is scheming, collapse follows. Thus, cultivating the *Dao* as at the start—with surplus in attainment, boundless in propagation—leads to immortality. It is pitiful that though they begin with diligence, they grow slack in the middle and fail to persevere. To always treat the end as the beginning, to never waver from goodness, is rare. Hence, this stern warning.*

*‘None lack a beginning’ is from the *Odes*—the *Great Odes* of *Dang* (《诗□大雅□荡》). It speaks of how the people were first taught sincerity, loyalty, and benevolence, yet now transform into corrupt customs. It says that those who do good cannot complete it.*

*‘None’ (靡) means ‘without.’ ‘Few’ (鲜) means ‘little.’ ‘Achieve’ (克) means ‘able.’*

*Thus, the Sage desires not to desire, and does not value treasures that are hard to obtain.*

*The annotations explain: Treasures that are hard to obtain are those beyond one’s inherent nature. The Sage, in not desiring what they do not desire and not scheming beyond their nature, preserves their spontaneity—thus they do not value treasures that are hard to obtain.*

*The commentaries explain: This clarifies the Sage’s conduct to contrast with the common. Treasures that are hard to obtain—internally, what lies beyond one’s nature; externally, pearls, rhinoceros horn, and precious gems. The Sage, in not desiring what they do not desire, does not labor to acquire what their nature lacks, nor does it scheme for treasures that accumulate virtue. Hence, it is said they do not value treasures that are hard to obtain.*

*The meaning is: The conduct of the great Sage transcends worldly concerns. Lust and desire cannot sway them; prosperity and decline cannot pressure them. Externally, they seek no gain; internally, they seek nothing beyond their nature. It is to advise rulers to value only the virtuous, and to urge cultivators to follow only the *Dao*."*

**On Treasures and Learning**

**Pearls**—when large, with a diameter of an inch, their radiance illuminates twelve chariots—were treasures prized by the ancients.

**Rhinoceros horn**—beyond the southern marches, there is a beast resembling a cow, weighing over a thousand *jin*, with a single horn at its snout, which may be made into a treasure. If its horn is broken in the middle, some display intricate patterns like flowing script or complete figures, others repel dust, and still others repel water. When ground into powder and ingested, they can dispel the ailments caused by witchcraft. Chickens, seeing them at night, are startled—thus they are called *haojī rú* (rhinoceros that terrify chickens). These too were treasures valued in both ancient and modern times.

**Precious gems**—gold and jade, rare plants, feathers, and furs—whatever is held in wonder and esteem by the multitude, all are called *treasures*.

**Cowrie shells**—found in the eastern seas, resembling conch shells, some bearing intricate patterns, with the largest reaching a foot in length—these too can be made into treasures. In the sea, they are called *shellfish*; on land, they are called *feng*; in water, they are called *tuó*. In ancient times, cowries were used as currency, and tortoiseshells were treasured. The Zhou Dynasty minted coins with cowrie motifs, and by the Qin, cowries were abandoned in favor of metal currency. The character *bèi* (贝) is pictographic in origin.

Today, all transactions—gifts, rewards, bounties, and bestowments of wealth and adornments—are derived from the radical of *bèi* (贝). The ancient verse states:
*"To hoard wealth is the folly of the ignorant."*
This makes clear that excessive wealth burdens one’s virtue.

In antiquity, there were three currencies: pearls and jade were the highest, gold was intermediate, and bronze and cloth were the lowest. These were used by emperors to govern the Four Seas.

**On Learning and Not Learning**
The common man prizes treasures that are hard to obtain, thus indulging in artificial pursuits and striving for what lies beyond their natural endowment. The Sage does not seek knowledge beyond their nature, always preserving their innate essence. Therefore, the admonition *"learning and not learning"* is meant to return the multitude to their excesses in study.

**Explanation:**
The Sage’s mind is vast as the void, the *Dao* permeates heaven and earth. They do not labor for knowledge beyond their measure, hence the warning against learning what is unnecessary. This is to caution the common man against their vain and excessive desires.

If travelers can grasp the Sage’s intent, abandoning such arrogance and greed, they will avoid the transgression of overreaching for wealth and ability.

To aid all things in their natural state, yet not to act artificially.

**Annotation:**
The Sage does not seek knowledge beyond their nature, thus the admonition *"learning and not learning"* is to return the multitude to their excessive studies, aiding their innate essence. Therefore, they dare not engage in vulgar learning or excessive desire.

**Explanation:**
Vulgar learning, with its elaborate theories, is difficult to reconcile with *wuwei* (non-action). Excessive desire, tangled and chaotic, further obscures true nature. The Sage commands *"learning and not learning"* to cultivate simplicity, *"desiring and not desiring"* to attain serenity, gradually glimpsing the light of the true *Dao*, thereby aiding nature’s essence.

Not coveting treasures that are hard to obtain, nor striving for abilities beyond their measure—self-defeating yet ultimately successful, cautious to the end as at the beginning, observing subtleties and warding off harm, returning to the ease of simplicity. Thus the realm is at peace, the self steadfast, and only then may one approximate the ancient masters of the *Dao*.

*The Broad Explication of the Dao De Jing’s Sacred Meaning, Volume 43 and 44 concluded.*

**The Broad Explication of the Dao De Jing’s Sacred Meaning**
*Volume 45 – Chapter 65: The Ancient Masters of the Dao*

**Exposition:**
The preceding chapter elucidates foresight and preemptive caution, advocating the eradication of emotional attachments and desires. This chapter reveals how excessive intelligence breeds misfortune, demonstrating the profound virtue of aligning with the natural order.

First, it clarifies the transformative power of the Dao.
Next, it refutes intelligence as a corrupting force.
Knowing this, it then advocates simplicity as the guiding principle.
The passage concludes with a sigh of admiration for its efficacy, urging cultivation.

**Meaning:**
The ancient masters of the Dao did not seek to enlighten the people openly, lest their brilliance provoke ambition and invite calamity. Instead, they concealed their wisdom, guiding the people across the boundless expanse of non-being. Thus, governing through intelligence breeds chaos, while obscuring it brings fortune. When deceitful cunning arises, governance becomes arduous; when it ceases, the mysteries deepen. As virtue becomes profound, the people return to simplicity, abandoning artificiality for the natural order—just as they shed the burdens of excessive learning and desire, attaining the harmony of all things converging toward the root.

The ancient masters of the Dao did not enlighten the people; they sought to make them ignorant.

**Annotation:**
The virtuous ruler who masters the Dao does not flaunt his teachings but leads with harmony, restoring them to their original simplicity—like the unknowing.

**Exposition:**
The ancient sage-rulers of the primordial age—when the world was still veiled in mystery—were profound in their intentions, their hearts obscured like the depths of the void. In their governance, there were no laws nor rewards; in their actions, no coercion nor enticement. Their presence was invisible, their voice inaudible. Their people were like those of the Maoshu Mountains, their customs akin to the dreamlike simplicity of Huaxu. The people did not reckon time, did not resist the natural cycles of fullness and emptiness, did not distinguish between familial and self. They wandered in ignorance, as if in a boundless dream. The rulers did not instruct them with conventional teachings but transformed them through non-action, so that the world became pure and unadulterated, as if the people were truly simple.

The difficulty in governing arises from their excess of intelligence.

**Annotation:**
When the ruler openly displays the Dao to govern below, the people must strain their intelligence to comply. The more they rely on cunning, the more deceit flourishes—making governance all the harder. This is because the ruler’s clarity compels the people to employ their intelligence, breeding fraud.

**Meaning:**
When the ruler governs by revealing the Dao, the people respond with artifice to serve him. Originally, governing through clarity should be straightforward, but when intelligence curdles into deceit, the source lies in the ruler’s own scrutiny. To seek tranquil governance is thus difficult. This lesson urges rulers to emulate the ancient sage-kings, who guided the people toward simplicity—making governance effortless. To rule through intelligence is to invite ruin; to rule through ignorance is to invite blessing.

**Annotation:**
*Yong* (用) here means "to employ." When a ruler relies on cunning ministers to govern, their schemes will proliferate, and with schemes, deceit arises—thus becoming the state’s undoing.

**Exposition:**
*Yong* (employ), *zei* (harm). When a ruler employs clever ministers to govern, their machinations will spawn, and with machinations, falsehoods emerge—corrupting the Dao and harming the state. Hence, it is called the state’s ruin.

**Meaning:**
Governing through intelligence aims to order the people, but when intelligence curdles into deceit, calamity and disorder follow. Thus, the rise of falsehood and harm becomes inevitable. When Cao Parameter adhered strictly to law, the Han dynasty flourished; when Shang Yang altered the laws, Qin declined. Hence, the *Classic* states: *"When cleverness emerges, great falsehood follows."* Not employing intelligence is the state’s blessing.

**Annotation:**
If the ruler does not employ deceitful ministers but instead selects virtuous officials—those who remain tranquil, nurturing the land like the stillness of a sleeping warrior, resolving conflicts with ease—then naturally, deceit will wane while simplicity flourishes. When the people are harmonious, the years will be bountiful—this is the state’s blessing.

**Exposition:**
The ruler is like a mirror: if the mirror is upright, its reflection is straight; if the mirror is crooked, its reflection is distorted. When the ruler is upright, the people follow suit; when he is corrupt, the people conform to his vice. The purity or corruption of the people stems from nothing else. Employing clever strategists spawns scheming; employing honest and thick-hearted men fosters virtuous customs. When the people are transformed into harmony, the state prospers—this is the blessing.

*Pianshi Fanwei* (偃息蕃魏) refers to Dan Ganmu, the teacher of Duke Wen of Wei, who prioritized tranquility and moral cultivation, ensuring the stability of Wei like a protective barrier.

*Pianshi* (偃息) means to rest in stillness; *Fanwei* (蕃魏) signifies the flourishing defense of Wei.

*Nongwan Jiedan* (弄丸解难) refers to the incident where the two great houses of Chu—White Gongsheng and the minister Xi—clashed in arms. Their envoys sought out Yiliang Yeliao, a recluse of the market south, who was said to be a master of *wuwei* (non-action). When the envoys arrived, he lay with his head propped up, unmoved by their plea.

「Lying motionless and not rising, he played with the ball between his two hands without ceasing, holding it up to a drawn sword—yet he did not flinch. The two ministers’ envoys each returned, fully recounting Yiliao’s demeanor.

The two ministers said: *"The reclining with a high pillow signifies his embrace of non-action (wuwei).*
*The sword held above him without movement shows that arms are not to be relied upon.*
*His two hands represent the two houses.*
*The ball is a round object, embodying non-action.*
*Both hands manipulating it endlessly means they will both cease only in exhaustion.*
*Thus, it is clear that if both houses persist in their armed strife, they will surely meet with destruction.*
*Yet the ministers laid down their arms and returned—this proves their conflict was difficult to resolve.*
*This account appears in *Zhuangzi* (《庄子》).*

*When non-action (wuwei) flourishes, action (youwei) naturally fades away.*
*When purity and simplicity are manifest, cleverness and deceit perish of their own accord.*
*This is the inevitable outcome of circumstances.*
*Is this not the blessing for a state?*
*To grasp these two principles is to establish a model.*

*Note: Employing cleverness and deceit harms others, while trusting in pure virtue benefits the people.*
*The ruler who always knows whom to entrust is said to possess profound and mysterious virtue (shenxuan zhī dé).*

*Commentary: These two refer to the use of cleverness and the avoidance of it.*
*They are models (kǎimó) and standards (shì, law).*
*Cleverness, if used, becomes a thief for the state; if avoided, it brings blessings.*
*The ruler must discard the thief and embrace the blessings.*
*Thus, one who does so can serve as the model and standard for governing the state.*

*Meaning: Using cleverness leads to chaos in the state, while avoiding it brings peace to the people.*
*To abandon chaos and seek peace is the essence of governance.*

*Those skilled in strategy and eloquent in debate adorn cleverness to deceive the lords,*
*and indulge in rhetoric to sow discord among rulers.*
*They split the firm and unite the disparate,*
*turn white into black,*
*striving only for fame and reputation,*
*for flattery and honor,*
*for petty disputes and personal gratification,*
*never considering security or the harm they cause.*
*If they gain the opportunity to indulge their flattery and empty words, they will take pride in it.*

*The ruler governing the state must discern and reject them,*
*then purity and simplicity will prevail,*
*and the people will return to their natural state.*

*To always grasp these models is called profound virtue (xuándé).*

*Note: Those with virtuous power (fúdé zhī chén) are also models for the ruler,*
*to be entrusted for the benefit of the people.*
*The ruler who understands this can rely upon them.*

*Commentary: Profound (xuán) means deep and wondrous.*
*If the ruler always understands this,*
*then these two principles become models,*
*and this is called profound, far-reaching, wondrous, and mysterious virtue.*

*Meaning: The ruler who knows to use cleverness or virtue,*
*to determine security and danger,*
*and who consistently follows this principle,*
*will possess virtue that is profound and far-reaching.*

*Profound virtue is deep and far-reaching,*
*contrary to the ways of things,*
*and only then does it attain the utmost harmony (dàshùn).*

*Note: Profound virtue, deep and far-reaching,*
*can reverse the course of things and return them to their original state,*
*allowing all things to reach their utmost harmony in natural disposition.*

*Commentary: This is a concluding sigh.*
*The ruler with profound virtue governs from above with non-action (wuwei),*
*his influence unfathomable—this is depth.*
*His blessings extend without limit—this is far-reaching.*
*Thus, he can return all things to their wondrous origin,*
*and only then do they attain utmost harmony in their true, natural nature.*

*Meaning: The utmost harmony (dàshùn) is rooted in human nature.*
*The *Records of Rites* (《礼记》) in the *Gongyang* (□礼运篇) says:*
*"Human nature is the field of the sage-kings."*
*Therefore, the sage-kings refine the principles of righteousness (yì),*
*establish the order of rituals (lǐ) to govern human nature.*
*They cultivate the field of human nature with rituals,*
*plow it with harmony of firm and yielding,*
*sow it with righteousness,*
*and nurture the Dao of goodness.*
*They weed it with recitation and learning,*
*preserving truth and discarding falsehood,*
*gather it with the foundation of humanity,*
*uniting what is formed,*
*and harvest it with music to bring peace,*
*stirring and solidifying the people’s hearts.*

*To govern the state without rituals is like plowing without a hoe.*
*To establish rituals without grounding them in righteousness is like plowing without sowing.*
*To practice righteousness without teaching it through learning is like sowing without weeding.*
*To teach it through learning without uniting it with humanity is like weeding without reaping.*
*To unite it with humanity without securing it with music is like reaping without eating.*
*To secure it with music without attaining harmony is like eating without nourishment.*

*When the four limbs are at ease and the skin and flesh plump, this is true nourishment for the body.*
*When father and son are devoted and brothers are amicable,*
*when husband and wife are harmonious, this is true nourishment for the family.*
*When great officials uphold the law and lesser ones are honest,*
*when ranks and duties are properly ordered,*
*and when ruler and subject align in correctness, this is true nourishment for the state.*
*The Son of Heaven uses virtue as his chariot and music as his reins,*
*the feudal lords interact with one another through rituals,*
*the ministers are bound by law,*
*the scholars are judged by their integrity,*
*and the common people are protected by mutual goodwill—this is true nourishment for the world.*
*This is called utmost harmony (dàshùn).*

*Therefore, when the Son of Heaven governs with harmony (shùn),*
*heaven does not hoard its Dao,*
*earth does not hoard its treasures,*
*and people do not hoard their nature—*
*abundant blessings emerge.*
*Harmony is the treasure of harmony.*

*The ruler who dwells above with profound virtue (xuándé),*
*and whose ministers below abide by loyalty and sincerity,*
*will have a transformation vast, deep, and thick,*
*returning all things to the pure customs (chúnfēng).*
*This is called attaining harmony with the Dao.*

*The ancient emperors and kings all revered and followed the ancient Way,*
*issuing their teachings and orders with sincerity,*
*relying on simplicity and humility,*
*and shepherding their people with modesty and harmony.*
*Thus, the *Book of Documents* (《书》) speaks of "investigating antiquity" (qǐgǔ),*
*and this is the example of Emperor Yao.*

*When the world attains utmost harmony (dàshùn),*
*all under heaven return to it.*
*When the rivers of the sea are modest and harmonious,*
*all streams flow toward them.*
*Thus, the chapter *Jianghai* (《江海》) can follow upon the virtue of utmost harmony.*

*Jianghai as the king of all streams, Chapter Sixty-Six*

*Commentary: The previous chapter illustrated that cleverness brings misfortune,*
*and demonstrated the profound virtue of attaining utmost harmony.*
*This chapter shows that goodness in the lower ranks makes one a king,*
*and sets forth the sage’s virtue of non-contention.*

*First, it uses the analogy of Jianghai,*
*showing that goodness in the lower ranks makes one a king.*
*Next, it explains the sage’s practice of modesty,*
*taking pleasure in promoting others without indulgence.*
*Finally, it concludes with the virtue of non-contention,*
*to indicate the path of cultivation.*

*Meaning: Jianghai rests below, yet all streams return to it.*
*The ruler who practices modesty will have all nations come to him in homage.*
*Thus, to rest above while the people do not revere,*
*or to step back while the people willingly promote,*
*is the profound virtue of the sage.*

The Jianghai rests as king through this virtue,
the Sage attains dominion through it,
forever aligning with the Way’s sovereign,
fulfilling the grand harmony’s rule.

It responds to the unworthy’s words,
yet ever follows the training of benevolence.

Jianghai becomes king of all streams
because it excels in humility—
thus it rules all streams.
**Annotation:** Jianghai commands the hundred valleys
because it excels in humility,
so all rivers converge in homage.

**Cushion:** It explains how Jianghai
makes rivers flow toward it as king—
because it dwells in the lowly current’s place.

Thus the *Yijing* says: *"The Earth’s Way transforms fullness into humility, flowing in modesty."*
This is the analogy invoked.

The Earth’s Way, through humility,
makes rivers converge and return.
The Sage, through humility,
makes the common folk come willingly without exhaustion.

**Meaning:** Humility is the foundation of elevation,
modesty the root of virtue.
Rivers flow eastward as if returning home—
homage to the virtuous in humility.
Ten thousand households face north in reverence—
the Sage’s virtue lies in modesty.

The common folk come naturally—
this is the principle.

Yan Junping said: *"Heaven and Earth do not abandon all things,
and all things abandon them to myriad creatures.
They do not seek to rule, yet all things come to them.*
Thus, though Heaven and Earth are vast,
the Great Dao rules them;
though yang-qi blazes,
Heaven rules it;
though yin-qi is solemn,
Earth rules it;
though living beings are countless,
the Sage rules them;
though winged creatures soar in the void,
the divine phoenix rules them;
though furred creatures tread the earth,
the qilin rules them;
though scaled creatures dwell in water,
the divine dragon rules them;
though shelled creatures dwell in marshes,
the spirit tortoise rules them;
though all rivers flow together,
Jianghai rules them.

These nine kings do not claim dominion,
yet all things come to them;
they do not impose laws,
yet all things are ordered;
they do not rely on trust and faith,
yet all things attach to them;
they do not depend on kindness and love,
yet all things grow close;
they do not wield intelligence and strength,
yet all things stand in awe.

Why is this?
They embody the Dao and harmonize with virtue,
entrusting to nature—
thus all things revere them.

Jianghai rules not through cleverness to please,
nor kindness to embrace,
nor commands to bind,
nor laws to exhort,
nor schemes to control.

Rivers converge because it rests low—
things naturally comply.

Thus, when a person dwells in humility,
with a modest, respectful, non-contentious heart,
they gather people and rule—
this is essential.

The Earth’s Way transforms fullness into flowing modesty—
the *Yijing*’s *Cong* hexagram’s *Simian* text states:
*"Hills and valleys, the high gradually descend,
the low gradually ascend—
changing fullness, flowing in modesty."*

**Annotation:** *"The common folk come"*—
from the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Zhao 10:
Chu Sun Zhaozi said:
*"The *Odes*—the *Great Odes*—say:
*'Begin with care, do not rush—
the common folk come as sons.'*
Meaning King Wen began the Lingtai,
with urgency in his heart,
and the people came willingly, joyful."*

Thus, the Sage desires to be above others
by speaking in humility.

**Cushion:** This merges the analogy.
The Sage does not truly desire to be above others,
yet speaks in humility.
The Sage knows fullness invites loss,
so in speech, they are modest and gentle,
adopting names of solitude and poverty to be below things,
while vast virtue and grand achievements
are naturally revered by all.

**Meaning:** The Sage humbles themselves,
without embellishment,
using names of solitude and poverty to display
that humility is fundamental,
and blaming themselves to fill the gaps—
revealing their self-reproachful heart.

Thus, great virtue grows ever more exalted,
and mighty deeds grow ever more steadfast.

*Hong*—great.
To go before others, they place themselves behind.

**Cushion:** The Sage does not desire to go before others,
only to practice humility,
placing themselves behind things—
thus things place them before.

**Meaning:** The Sage does not desire to go before others,
yet curiously places themselves behind.
Because they diligently follow the Dao,
not placing themselves before things,
they are pushed forward by all things.

Thus, though they dwell above, people do not grow weary of them;
though they stand before, people do not harm them.

**Annotation:** Humility is the handle of virtue,
and the more it is used, the brighter it shines.
By speaking in humility,
the people joyfully uphold them—
thus, though they dwell above, people do not see them as burdensome.
By placing themselves behind,
the people come as sons—
thus, though they stand before, people do not see them as harmful.

**Cushion:** This concludes the previous section.
The Sage, in the supreme treasure’s position,
at the utmost height of honor,
labors for themselves while resting others,
depletes themselves while enriching things—
those above gain life,
so they are not seen as burdensome;
those before gain order,
so they are not seen as harmful.

**Meaning:** The ruler’s virtue is humble and empty,
worthy of all’s reverence—
thus, though they dwell above, they are not burdensome.
The ruler’s virtue is bright and clear,
shared in reverence—
thus, though they stand before, they are not harmful.

If their merit is flourishing above,
people all uphold them,
gazing upon them like the sky.
If they are sinful and wicked before,
people all abandon them,
viewing them as enemies.
This is to say: *With the Way, they flourish; without it, they perish.*

Thus, the world delights in promoting them without exhaustion.

**Annotation:** Because they are neither burdensome nor harmful,
the world’s people joyfully uphold them as sovereign,
without growing weary.

**Cushion:** The Sage’s virtue is vast and beneficent, without selfishness,
bringing spring to all things,
gazed upon like the sun—
neither burdensome nor harmful—
thus the world’s people joyfully uphold them without weariness.

**Meaning:** When Yao governed the world,
the eight directions and all living beings gathered like clouds,
gazed upon like the sun,
promoted as sovereign without exhaustion.
When he departed the world,
the people mourned him as if losing parents,
and for three years, the music was suppressed.

Why is this so?

It is because **virtue** is rooted in humility, and **transformation** in *wuwei* [non-action].
Since they do not contend, none under heaven can contend with them.

**Annotation:** The Sage is humble and retiring, not contending with things. The world delights in promoting them—who would dare to contend?

**Cushion:** Now, why does the world joyfully uphold the Sage without exhaustion?
Is it not because the Sage, in speech, places others first, and in conduct, follows behind?
Since they do not vie for precedence with things, none under heaven can vie for precedence with the Sage.

**Meaning:** The Sage governs the world—**virtue** and **transformation** spread universally,
illumination reaching the four quarters, beneficence encompassing the nine regions.
With humility, they do not lead things;
with gentleness, they do not place themselves above them.
The people naturally acclaim and enthrone them—who would contend?
Thus, their blessings endure far and long, their lineage flourishing and vast.

Like the great sea receiving all rivers,
neither overflowing nor deficient,
like the Most High holding the Three Treasures,
with compassion and frugality.

Therefore, the next chapter follows with the Three Treasures.

*End of Volume Forty-Four of the Broad Explication of the Dao-De Jing*
*Beginning of Volume Forty-Five of the Broad Explication of the Dao-De Jing*

---

**Volume Forty-Four of the Broad Explication of the Dao-De Jing** concludes with the words of the Sage.

**Volume Forty-Five of the Broad Explication of the Dao-De Jing** begins:

The world all says my Dao is vast, yet it seems unmatched.
**Meaning:** The Dao is vast, yet it appears unlike anything else.

**Annotation:** *Not matched* means *unlike*.

The Laozi says: "The people of the world all say my Dao is vast, with nothing to compare it to."
I then respond.

**Explication:** *Not matched* means *unlike*. The Laozi states: "The people of later generations all say my Dao is vast and formless, unlike anything that can be compared." The following text answers this.

**Meaning:** The heavens and earth are vast, yet they have forms of clarity and turbidity;
the sun and moon are vast, yet they have radiant illumination.
But the Dao’s vastness is without scent or sound,
without form or likeness—
thus it cannot be imitated or discussed,
and that is why the world’s people all say the Dao is unlike anything else.

Only because it is truly vast does it seem unmatched.
If it were matched, it would long ago have been diminished to triviality.

**Annotation:** Only because my Dao is supremely vast does it have no likeness or comparison.
If it were like the myriad laws of past ages,
it would not be called "vast" for long—
it would already be petty and shallow.

**Explication:** This explains why it seems unmatched.
Only because my Dao is vast and transcends all things
does it escape the grasp of ordinary understanding,
and thus it can be called truly vast.
If it had likeness or comparison,
like the myriad laws of past ages,
it would lose its claim to vastness.
Such petty and shallow laws
differ little from the common ways—
how could they be called truly vast?

*This* is an auxiliary particle for emphasis.

**Meaning:** The Dao encompasses all things,
its vastness without comparison—
that is why it is called "vast."
If it were like the heavens and earth,
with fixed forms and positions,
or like the sun and moon,
with discernible radiance,
then it could be named, spoken of,
measured or calculated—
but then it would not be called the "Great Dao,"
for such would merely be the ordinary state of things,
and that has long existed.

I have Three Treasures,
which I preserve and uphold.

**Annotation:** Though my Dao is vast and without comparison,
it still contains these Three Practices,
which are most precious.
If one steadfastly preserves and upholds them,
they can govern oneself and the nation.

**Explication:** This clarifies why it seems unmatched—
for it possesses these Three Practices,
which differ from the common ways.
Thus the Laozi says: Though my Dao is vast and without comparison,
it still contains these Three Treasures,
which are most precious.
For those of your age, you must preserve and uphold them,
to cultivate yourself and govern the nation.

**Meaning:** The Dao, though it embraces all laws and practices,
transforms the heavens and earth,
and its benefits reach beyond measure.
Yet the Three Treasures cherished by the Most High
and taught to the world are these:
the first is **compassion**,
the second is **frugality**,
and the third is **not daring to lead the world**.

**Annotation:** *Compassion* means universal aid;
*frugality* means sufficient resources without waste;
*not daring to lead the world* means harmony without domination,
so that others willingly follow without complaint.

**Explication:** This enumerates the Three Treasures.
To embody benevolence and extend broad aid,
to love and nurture all beings—
that is **compassion**.
To regulate use and benefit others,
to avoid depletion of resources—
that is **frugality**.
To not initiate action,
to harmonize without asserting—
that is **not daring to lead the world**.
Their expansive benefits are detailed below.

**Meaning:** The Dao preserves love and nurtures life,
and thus **compassion** is its first principle.
To nourish people while sparing expense,
**frugality** is its second check.
To place others before oneself,
**letting** is its final virtue.

**Compassion** follows the Way of Heaven,
its beneficence extending without limit;
**frugality** follows the Way of Earth,
its great trust never deceiving;
**letting** follows the Way of humanity,
its reverence and humility unchallenged.
These three are the foundation of governance,
the root of personal conduct—
treasures of the highest worth.
Thus they are called the **Three Treasures**.

The Three Treasures are the **practices** of the Dao.
The vastness that seems unmatched is the **essence** of the Dao.
To grasp the Dao’s essence
and apply its practices
is the priority for governing oneself and the nation.

**Compassion** generates courage,
**Annotation:** Benevolence, mercy, and aid
leave virtue in abundance,
and thus one is courageous in rescue and relief.

**Explication:** This further describes the benefits of the Three Treasures.
Ordinary people, greedy and competitive, lack compassion—
their courage lies in boldness and ruthlessness,
leading to exhaustion and defeat.
Now the Sage practices **compassion**—
thus their courage lies in relief and salvation.
The *Analects* says: "The virtuous must have courage."
**Meaning:** To spread benevolence and extend aid,
to embrace all beings with universal love—
that is **compassion**.
With **compassion** to aid all things,
no thing is left unbenefited;
with **compassion** to establish deeds,
no deed is left unrewarded;
with **compassion** to govern the nation,
its grace permeates all lands;
with **compassion** to cultivate oneself,
its harmony balances all movements.
Thus the benefits of **compassion** are invincible—
violence cannot encroach,
force cannot harm,
slander cannot divide,
flattery cannot deceive.
Its effects manifest outwardly
though its practice lies inwardly—
that is true courage.

Ordinary people, greedy and competitive, lack compassion—
how could they dare to relieve others?
Without good deeds, they face times of ruin and defeat.
But the Sage, having resolved to practice compassion,
must be courageous in salvation.
Thus it is called **courage**.
"The virtuous must have courage," from the *Analects*—**Book of □** (Confucius).

The Sage declares:

*"Those with virtue must have words, but those with words do not necessarily have virtue.
The virtuous must have courage, yet the courageous are not necessarily virtuous.
This is so.*

*Frugality thus enables abundance.*
**Annotation:** Through moderation and thrift, wealth is preserved, and benevolent deeds extend widely.
**Commentary:** By practicing frugality and cherishing resources, one neither depletes wealth nor harms others, thus benevolent deeds spread far.
**Explanation:** Thrift leads to abundance; abundance enables universal kindness. When kindness is universally bestowed, it may truly be called abundant.

*When the sovereign governs with frugality,*
the court lacks extravagant ornamentation,
the people suffer no burdensome exactions,
and daily grace and virtue flourish—
there will surely be no calamity of famine or exhaustion.

*Not daring to lead the world first,*
one attains the position of the sacred vessel’s master.
**Annotation:** The virtues of compassion and frugality are enhanced by humility.
**Commentary:** By yielding to others and advancing them, one does not presume to lead.
Thus one becomes the master of the sacred vessel.
**Explanation:** The Sage, as the great treasure, is an instrument of divine authority—
not something achieved by human force alone, but the supreme treasure of Heaven and Earth.
To govern as its master, one must retreat from self and advance others, humbling oneself to serve first.
When others willingly follow, only then does one assume the position of ruler over all under Heaven.

*These three treasures—*
if one cultivates the Dao and governs the state by practicing them,
they become personal conduct.
What is meant by ‘conduct’ is compassion and frugality, not daring to lead the world first.
What is meant by ‘fruit’ is the reward of conduct—
courage, abundance, and attaining mastery of the sacred vessel—
the three outcomes gained through practice.

*Now, if one abandons compassion and courage,*
courage harms others;
*if one abandons frugality and abundance,*
abundance depletes wealth;
*if one abandons humility and presumption,*
presumption invites resentment.
To harm others and deplete wealth,
to gather resentment—
this is the path to ruin.
Thus it is said: *‘This is death.’*
**Annotation:** *‘Abandon’* here means reckless neglect.
Worldly desires often conflict with the Dao.
To abandon compassion that benefits others,
to recklessly pursue courage that harms,
to abandon frugality and recklessly indulge in extravagance,
to abandon humility and recklessly seek preeminence—
such conduct violates compassion and frugality.
Applied to governance, it brings national ruin;
applied to self-cultivation, it brings personal destruction.
Thus it is said: *‘This is death.’*
**Explanation:** Ordinary people abandon the Sage’s path,
discarding these three treasures,
indulging their folly—
recklessly pursuing courage without compassion,
recklessly indulging in extravagance without frugality,
striving to excel without yielding to others.
All such actions lead to self-destruction and national ruin,
the roots of resentment and harm.
Truly, this is death.

*If one persistently practices compassion,*
one attains courage in aiding others;
*if one persistently practices frugality,*
one attains abundance in benefiting others;
*if one persistently practices humility,*
one achieves the excellence of thick virtue and leadership over the people.
If one abandons even one of these,
one strays far from the Dao.

*What produces these three fruits?*
Compassion aids others, fulfilling its purpose;
frugality benefits others, fulfilling its kindness;
humility serves others first, fulfilling its virtue.
How could one lightly abandon them?

*Compassion, when wielded in war, brings victory;
when wielded in defense, brings security.*
**Annotation:** To wage war with compassion is to prioritize the safety of the people.
To defend with compassion is to ensure the people’s security.
Each preserves safety, thus achieving victory and steadfastness.
**Commentary:** Compassion is the foremost of the three treasures, hence its singular praise.
To wage war with compassion is to preserve the people;
to defend with compassion is to secure them.
Neither deviates from compassion, hence victory and steadfastness.
**Explanation:** *War* refers to armies clashing in battle.
When forces meet on the field, blades clash—this is war.
If one is reckless in slaughter, disregarding mercy,
victory and defeat are uncertain.
But if compassion is prioritized, victory is assured.
Victory lies in compassion, not in killing.

*Defense* means firmly resisting at the gates.
If defense is conducted with compassion first,
the people’s resolve is unshaken.
If one relies solely on moats and ramparts for strength,
the certainty of victory in defense is unknown.
Thus, the benefits of compassion are indeed vast.

*Heaven aids those it saves with compassion,*
*and guards those it protects with compassion.*
**Annotation:** To wage war or defend with compassion
is not merely to unite the people—
Heaven’s clarity also aids and guards.
Victory in war is Heaven’s aid;
steadfastness in defense is Heaven’s protection—
both stem from compassion, hence *Heaven aids with compassion and guards with compassion.*
**Commentary:** *Aid* means assistance; *guard* means protection.
Heaven rewards the virtuous—
the virtuous are assured of no misfortune.
Thus, those who wage war with compassion receive Heaven’s aid;
those who defend with compassion receive Heaven’s protection.
Victory in war and steadfastness in defense
initially depend on the practice of compassion,
and ultimately gain Heaven’s assistance.

**Explanation:** Heaven’s ways favor none—
it always aids the virtuous.
The virtuous are those who practice compassion.
Compassion takes mercy as its foundation,
and salvation as its function.
Thus, those who practice compassion
cannot be opposed by others.
In war, the compassionate prevail;
in defense, the compassionate endure.
Aligning with Heaven’s ways and moving the hearts of others,
none can harm them—
this is Heaven’s aid and protection.

*Here, the three treasures are taught:*
Compassion and frugality demonstrate their salvific power.
First, the great Dao is proclaimed without bounds;
later, it is followed by those who do not rely on brute force.
Even without the logic of coercive strength,
compassion suffices to repel enemies,
and one may still achieve Heaven’s success.*

**Chapter Sixty-Eight: The Virtuous Way of the Ancient Scholar**

**Explanation:**
The previous chapter revealed the unworthy and taught the Three Treasures through the practice of compassion. This chapter clarifies that the virtuous scholar does not rely on force, marking four virtues that align with Heaven’s ultimate principle. First, it sets forth the four virtues. Next, it praises their essence as non-contentious. Finally, it concludes that virtue suffices to align with Heaven, thus illuminating the ancient essential Way.

**Explanation:**
The virtue of the great Sage harmonizes with the mysterious Dao—beyond logical comprehension, beyond praise. Yet through teaching and salvation, awakening the benighted and striking the ignorant, it broadly demonstrates the path of cultivation and elucidates the principles of cause and effect. Thus, the Three Treasures are proclaimed as safeguarding virtues, and the four virtues as stages of accumulating goodness. If one’s deeds can align with Heaven, what need is there for contention?

Next, it explains advancing an inch and retreating a foot, never straying from the rule of humility and restraint.

**The Virtuous Way of the Ancient Scholar Does Not Rely on Force**
*Note: 士 (scholar) means "affairs of governance."*
The virtuous scholar, who governs by Dao, values virtue over force, hence "does not rely on force."

**Explanation:**
The scholar (affairs of governance), *Note: 武 (force) means "threat."* The enlightened ruler governs by Dao, practices compassion and frugality to nurture the people, and does not rely on coercion. What is valued is compassion, hence "does not rely on force."

**Explanation:**
The ruler who follows the Dao governs first by transforming through Dao, then by teaching through virtue, then by soothing with culture, demonstrating sincerity and harmony, and nurturing with benevolence. Thus, harmony renders force unnecessary.

So-called force as a precaution is for preparedness against the unforeseen, not for constant use. Hence, it is said "does not rely on force," meaning force is not employed.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
*"Double gates and beating drums await the violent intruder."*
The truly skilled warrior does not rage.
*Note: When action is unavoidable and enemies must be met, compassion is the virtue—rage is not relied upon.*

**Explanation:**
When armies march to confront enemies, the matter lies in compassion and pity. Even as a mosquito bites, one drives it away—no more. Thus, the skill of war lies in halting the enemy, not in raging.

Hence, it is said: *"The skilled warrior does not rage."*

**Explanation:**
The wise ruler, when governing, has no need for arms. If arms are raised, it is only when absolutely necessary. Thus, with superior wisdom and strategy, there is conquest without war. If victory is achieved, it is not for the joy of killing—sometimes the defeated are treated with mourning rites, weeping in sorrow. How could rage be the means to seek slaughter?

The one who excels in defeating enemies does not contend.
*Note: Victory lies in harmony; harmony ensures good victory. True victory is thus non-contentious.*

**Explanation:**
The skilled victor does not seek widespread slaughter, nor does he rely on rage to overpower. He subdues through compassion and softens through virtue. Sometimes, he disarms his foe with conciliation; sometimes, he turns his weapons against his own troops; sometimes, he lifts the siege with a song; sometimes, the rebellious repent at the sight of his banners. This is true victory.

The one who excels in using people places himself beneath them.
*Note: To delight in leading people, they must exert their full strength—this is achieved by humbling oneself first.*

**Explanation:**
To skillfully employ people, one must speak with humility. Only then will they give their utmost effort, ensuring success. Thus, *The Classic of Changes* says:
*"To place the noble beneath the lowly is to greatly win people’s hearts."*

**Explanation:**
To grasp the reins and honor the worthy, the worthy will surely be put to use. To nurse wounds and comfort the soldiers, the soldiers will surely rally. Once the hearts of the people are moved, they will surely exert their full strength. Is this not the way of skillful employment?

The one who places the noble beneath the lowly finds in *The Classic of Changes*, *Layered Difficulties* (屯卦), Hexagram 23, Line 1:
*"Swirling and hesitating, advantageous to remain steadfast, advantageous to establish a lord."*

The *Symbolic Phrases* say:
*"Though swirling and hesitating, his resolve is upright—
To place the noble beneath the lowly is to greatly win the people’s hearts."*

This refers to the initial stage of *Layered Difficulties*, where movement is hard to generate. One cannot advance, hence the hesitation. It is advantageous to establish a lord by calming the chaos through stillness, guarding stillness to await opportunity, ensuring the people’s steadfastness through rectitude, and expanding rectitude through humility.

When the people’s ruler first appears and then humbles himself, the noble (yang) is exalted while the lowly (yin) is honored. By placing the noble beneath the lowly, one rightly gains their allegiance.

This illustrates how the ruler should take humility as his foundation and self-effacement as his base to win the people’s hearts.

This is called the **virtue of non-contention**.

*Commentary:*
This concludes the discussion of the four virtues: the virtuous warrior is always gentle yet never forceful; the skilled combatant is always merciful yet never wrathful; the master of victory is always yielding yet never contentious; the adept at employing people is always humble and places himself beneath them. Thus, all things exhaust their potential, and people give their utmost—all stemming from humility and self-effacement. Is this not the virtue of non-contention?

*Exposition:*
With courtesy, one honors the worthy, and the worthy will surely exhaust their abilities. With delight, one employs people, and people will surely unleash their strength. One does not rely on anger to harm others, nor does one boast of martial prowess to claim victory. Mercy comes first, humility is the foundation. One does not forcefully contend for victory nor exalt oneself while belittling others. When employing talent in this way, people will devote their lives to the cause—whether in defense or in war—ensuring stability and triumph. In governing oneself and the state, one attains longevity and lasting peace, advancing without hindrance. This is the virtue of non-contention.

This is called **employing people’s strength**.

*Commentary:*
The sage remains silent, reverent, and humble, and the people’s hearts are gladdened, eager to exhaust their strength. Hence, *The Classic of Changes* says:
*"Delight in employing the people, and the people forget their toil."*

This is employing people’s strength.

*Exposition:*
The teachings of the sage in governing the state and cultivating oneself: gentleness and deference make virtue shine; humility and harmony make people submit. When employing people, they exhaust their strength; when spreading transformation, its reach knows no bounds. Thus, it is said: employing people’s strength.

Delighting in employing people is described in the *Joyous* (兑) Hexagram:
*"Joyous—this is delight. In harmony with Heaven and responsive to humanity, delight in employing people, and the people forget their toil. Delight in facing danger, and the people forget their deaths."*

This praises the power of delight and further clarifies the virtue of responsiveness to others. First, delight the people and then command their service, and they will exhaust their strength, forgetting their labor. Such is the extent of delight’s influence on people—how could it not inspire them?

Thus, those who rage in battle court disaster, those who take martial prowess as their duty embody a cruel virtue, those who contend for victory are arrogant and oppressive, and those who rule with tyranny invite calamity. What benefit does this bring to oneself or the state?

This is called **harmonizing with Heaven**, the ultimate ancient principle.

*Annotation:*
The virtue of skillful victory is the virtue of non-contention; placing oneself beneath others is employing people’s strength. Those who can do this may harmonize with Heaven and claim the imperial mandate. This is the supreme ancient Dao.

*Commentary:*
This summarizes the four virtues above: the virtue of non-contention. Those who practice it may harmonize with Heaven and claim the imperial mandate—this is the ultimate ancient principle.

*Exposition:*
Only the worthy ruler harmonizes with Heaven, acting as Heaven’s deputy in governing all things. He must rely on sagely virtue to achieve harmony among people. The Three Treasures prioritize mercy and frugality, and the four virtues prioritize humility and yielding. One does not boast of martial achievements nor seek victory in war. If one truly aligns with the Dao, then the principle of *"the guest retreats a pace"* emerges—fearing that reckless aggression invites ruin. When weapons are about to clash, it is the compassionate who prevail.

*Chapter on the Principles of Warfare* (用兵有言), Section Sixty-Nine.

*Commentary:*
The previous chapter clarified that the virtuous warrior practices non-contention, thus able to harmonize with Heaven. This chapter explains the principles of warfare: reckless aggression nearly destroys one’s treasures. The first sentence establishes the theme with a rhetorical question. The next six sentences demonstrate the practice with clarifications. The final four sentences warn about warfare, emphasizing that mercy ensures victory.

*Exposition:*
The enlightened ruler takes expansive mercy as his foundation, holds fast to humility, and treats others with courtesy. The warnings against the Three Treasures and the four virtues are profound. The principle of *"the guest retreats a pace"* is carefully observed. Though hasty advance is impossible, retreat is wise. Without aggression or domination, what calamity or worry remains? One’s treasures are preserved, and compassion secures victory—this truth is clear. Yet who understands and who practices it? The wise are rare, and discernment is precious.

This unifies the intent of the preceding chapters.

**Principles of Warfare:**

*Annotation:*
The Ancient Sage lamented that rulers of his time cruelly slaughtered people in war, so he borrowed antiquity to issue a warning. *"Has spoken"* refers to the following sentence.

*Commentary:*
The Ancient Sage despised the contemporary policy of reckless aggression leading to disaster, delighting in war and killing people. Thus, he invoked antiquity to admonish.

*Exposition:*
The Great Dao cherishes life and abhors killing, while rulers delight in war and harm the people. As a ruler, one covets territory and wages war to the ends of the earth; as a subject, one seeks glory and battles through barren wastes, leaving bones scattered across the plains and blood staining the grass. The Ancient Sage pitied his people, mourned the innocent, and expounded the law to deliver the ultimate warning.

Thus, warfare is not the tool of the virtuous, and battle is a mechanism of peril. Even the ruler who cherishes life may resort to it when necessary, but if he does not exercise caution, he becomes a tyrant. I dare not be the aggressor but only the responder.

*Commentary:*
*"I"* refers to those who wage war. The aggressor initiates conflict, while the responder defends with mercy. The ancient principles of warfare always included warnings: one must guard oneself with mercy and never initiate aggression out of greed.

Thus it is said: *"I dare not be the aggressor but only the responder."*

**Explanation:**
In an age of peace, the one who initiates action is the aggressor, while the one who responds is the defender. When armies are deployed in the wilderness, the responder becomes the aggressor, and the defender takes the role of the aggressor—such is the fixed distinction between aggressor and defender in warfare.

The *Art of War* speaks of this in reverse terms. Yet the Dao of aggressor and defender, the suitability of victory or defeat, rests upon wise strategy, not upon brute force. If one kills to win, or recklessly engages to earn glory, then misfortune and ruin will not be foreseen, and survival cannot be assured.

Thus it is said: *"The general is the steward of life and death."* Life and death turn upon a pivot; gain and loss shift like the palm of a hand—how can one not be cautious? The Ancient Sage’s warnings command gentleness, urging one to measure the enemy without provoking conflict, to respond without contention. If one acts from love for others, how could one seek victory? Through mercy and yielding, one may yet preserve all—if this principle is upheld, Heaven itself will aid and guard with compassion.

*"I dare not advance even an inch, yet retreat a foot."*

**Annotation:**
When the aggressor acts, he stirs conflict out of greed; when the defender remains still, he guards with mercy. To guard is to achieve complete victory; to provoke is to invite ruin. Though retreat may seem greater, it does not lose in humility; though advance may seem slight, it cannot escape greed. Thus, one does not dare advance even an inch, yet retreats a foot.

**Commentary:**
To retreat in accordance with the Dao is to achieve victory; to advance in force is to court ruin. Even a small advance harbors the sin of greed, while even great retreat embodies humility and yielding. Now, despising rivalry, it is said: *"I dare not advance even an inch."* Valuing mercy and yielding, it is said: *"Yet retreat a foot."*

**Explanation:**
To govern by the Dao is not to rely on military prowess, but to nurture the people through virtue. Peace is labored without arms. Moreover, war is a cruel instrument; battle is a perilous affair. To drive the living like cattle, to wield deadly weapons, to penetrate enemy lands—this is to court one’s own destruction. How can this be the duty of a ruler?

He who advances greedily delights in slaughter, and slaughter breeds cruelty. He who retreats with courage harbors mercy, and mercy aligns with the Dao. Those who retreat a foot in accordance with the Dao may be said to achieve ten thousand victories and preserve all.

This is called *"action without action"*—
**Annotation:**
As the defender retreats a foot, he does not contend with others. Though he moves to meet the enemy, his inaction is as complete as non-action itself.

**Commentary:**
The purpose of deploying troops is to halt the enemy, and halting the enemy depends on not contending. Now, as the defender retreats a foot, he achieves victory without contention—though he moves to meet the enemy, his essence is non-action.

**Explanation:**
To respond to the enemy and deploy troops is done out of necessity—how could one truly dare to march? To guard the people with mercy, to govern them with virtue, to avoid sharp contention and have no intent to conquer—then victory through virtue is natural.

The *Lingbao Scripture* states: *"Those who uphold the Dao regulate their hearts with discipline. When others attack, their resolve is not to retaliate."* Is this not what is meant?

*"Though without arms,..."*

「Annotations:
*"Sleeving the arm"* is an expression of anger.
Now, the adept warrior does not grow angry, so it is as if there is no arm to sleeve.

**Exposition:**
The annotation states that *"sleeving the arm"* is an expression of anger. The adept warrior does not grow angry, so it is as if there is no arm to sleeve. Hence, it is said: *"Sleeving without arms."*

**Meaning:**
When a warrior grows angry, his eyes bulge, his crown is thrust aside, his garments are seized, and his arms are sleeved—his intent is sharp for contention in battle.
The *Dao* as principle abhors killing and upholds mercy.
Since there is no contention, there is naturally no enemy.
If there is a need to respond to the enemy and deploy troops, it is not done to forcefully contend, so it is as if there is no arm to sleeve.

**Still without enemies.**
**Annotation:**
*"Still"* means to provoke.

To provoke the enemy is to desire contention, yet since non-contention is virtue, it is as if there is no enemy to provoke.

**Exposition:**
*"Still"* means to provoke.
To provoke the enemy is to desire contention.
Now, since non-contention is virtue, it is as if there is no enemy to provoke, hence: *"Still without enemies."*

**Meaning:**
Since there is no provocation, there is no warfare. With an enemy yet no contention, it is as if there is no enemy at all.

**Holding without weapons.**
**Annotation:**
*"Holding"* means to grasp. *"Weapons"* refers to the five weapons—*gē* (halberd), *máo* (spear), *shū* (dagger-axe), *jǐ* (pike), and *gān* (long spear). To grasp weapons is to express intent to kill.
Now, with mercy as the foundation, even if one grasps them, it is as if there are no weapons.

**Exposition:**
*"Holding"* is akin to *"grasping."*
Weapons include the five: *gē*, *máo*, *shū*, *jǐ*, and *gān*.
To grasp weapons is to intend killing the enemy. Yet with mercy as the foundation, one restrains the *gē* and *gān*—though weapons exist, there is no intent to kill, thus it is as if there are no weapons.

**Meaning:**
To rule by the *Dao* is to be a sovereign who does not rely on warfare. Though troops are deployed out of necessity, victory lies in harmony, and armies march by discipline.
Without ambition to expand territory or borders, without intent to clash and accumulate grievances, movement is as non-action, enemies as nonexistent, sleeving as if without arms, and holding as if without weapons.

By these four *"withouts,"* one aligns with the Three Treasures (*sān bǎo*—Compassion, Frugality, Humility), then arrows like *shè yù* (crossbow bolts) with quiver straps, *wū háo* (crow-screaming) bows of *fán ruò* (weak sinew), *yú cháng* (fish-gut) knives of *kūn wú* (ancient bronze), *tài ē* (Great Cleave) and *jù què* (Giant Gap) swords, *wú gōu* (Hook of Wu) spears, *chǔ máo* (Chu spears), and *shǔ nǔ* (Shu crossbows) with *mèng láo* (Meng Lao’s mechanisms)—what need is there to grasp them? They serve no purpose.

The five weapons—*gē*, *máo*, *shū*, *jǐ*, and *gān*—are ranked in five grades.
From the *Zhōu Lǐ* (Rites of Zhou), the *lú rén* (shelter-makers) craft shelters, and if their tools exceed three *shì* (a *shì* being a double-handspan, roughly 13.125 cm), they cannot be wielded by hand.
*"Secret"* refers to the haft. The *gē*’s haft is 6.6 *chǐ* (feet) long, the *shū* 14.4 *chǐ* (a *zhǐ* being 8 *chǐ*, so 1 *zhǐ* = 8 *chǐ*, thus 14.4 *chǐ* = 1.8 *zhǐ*).
Eight *chǐ* is called a *rén* (fathom), meaning 12 *chǐ*.
The *máo* is typically 4 *chǐ*, while the *yí máo* (long spear) is 3 *rén* (24 *chǐ*).
*"Yí"* means long—24 *chǐ* in length.
For open-field warfare, weapons should be long; for mountain-forest combat, short.
The grip should be comfortable, the blade durable.
Hooked weapons (*gōu bīng*) for fishing spears should not slip;
thrusting weapons should not falter;
halberds and dagger-axes for striking should balance strength in upward and downward strokes, used swiftly.

Weapons include drums, horns, metal armor, tusks, flags, axes, maces, armor, banners, pennants, plumes, bows, crossbows, and arrows—each with its regulations. Generally, they are divided into five ranks, governed by the *sān zhì* (three systems) and *jiǔ zhāng* (nine chapters) laws. Short weapons vary—knives, swords, daggers—all tools to repel enemies and ensure victory.

Since mercy restrains the enemy and virtue leads the troops, though weapons are held, they are not used—thus, as if without weapons.

The *Shuō Wén* (Explanations of Texts) states: *"Clasping hands while holding an axe is called *bīng* (weapon)."*
No greater calamity exists than underestimating the enemy. To underestimate the enemy risks losing the Treasure of Mercy.

**Annotation:**
The greatest calamity is to slight the enemy, for slighting the enemy nearly causes the loss of the Treasure of Mercy.

**Exposition:**
*"Jī"* means near. *"Sàng"* means to lose. *"Bǎo"* refers to mercy.
The greatest calamity is to slight the enemy. If one engages in contention thus, it nearly causes the loss of the Treasure of Mercy.

Moreover, losing mercy means defeat in war and dispersal in defense. Though disasters may come from varied paths, dispersal and defeat are the greatest calamities.

**Meaning:**
The *Dao* of wielding arms: when an enemy nation stands before you, first undermine their plans, then assess their strength.
If courage and cowardice are balanced, and numbers are equal, yet still you seize the timing of Heaven, leverage the advantages of Earth, discern the rightness of principle, and harmonize with the people—
Sometimes with high ramparts and deep trenches, you blunt the sharp resolve of Zhuge Liang;
or burn the boats to feign death, avenging the humiliation of the Qin’s *miù* (deceit).
To meet one’s end like the fallen *cháng xīng* (long star), or seal the enemy’s corpse and return in triumph.
If not, then five thousand march deep into the wilderness, forever mourning at the *yàn sè* (wild goose pass) and *lóng duī* (Dragon Pile);
a million advance recklessly, yet falter at the wind’s howl and the cry of cranes.
The grass and trees of Jìnshān take human form, and the rhinoceros and elephants of Kūnyáng serve no purpose for you.
Then the Treasure of Humble Mercy is lost.

Thus, when armies clash, the compassionate prevail.

**Annotation:**
*"Kàng"* means to raise. When two nations raise arms against each other, the one who is compassionate and merciful wins.

**Exposition:**
*"Kàng"* means to raise.
When two nations raise arms against each other, if their sovereigns follow the *Dao*, their generals act with mercy, and they show compassion to others without seeking excessive slaughter, they will prevail.

**Meaning:**
Even if barbarians invade the borders, wolves harm the state, the wicked commit atrocities, and rebels disrupt order—when troops are mobilized, gates are reinforced, and laws are enforced to aid the people in eliminating harm, though it is done out of necessity, one must still fear that excessive resistance contradicts benevolence. Thus, compassion aligns with the *Dao*.
Those who align with the *Dao* must win.
Those who contradict benevolence must perish—this is the constant principle of Heaven. How could it be falsely obscured?
Let not the power of mercy be overlooked.

**Beginning of Volume Forty-Six of the *Extensive Commentary on the Dao De Jing’s Sacred Meaning***

**Chapter Seventy: "My Teachings Are Very Easy to Know"**

My words are very easy to know,
My deeds are very easy to follow.

**Commentary:**
The Master Guangcheng of the Tang dynasty, Du Guangting, expounds:
The previous chapter elucidates the principles of warfare, warning against reckless aggression.
This chapter reveals the unobstructed teachings of *Dao*, showing that they are easy to know—
easy to know, then one must surely grasp their essence.
A ruler who acts recklessly will lose his compassion and benevolence.
First, it is explained that the sage’s teachings are easy to know.
Next, it is shown that those lost in confusion do not understand.
Under "My words are very easy to know," it further elucidates the reason for their confusion.
Later, it laments the sage’s hidden virtue, urging the worthy to strive in practice.

**Meaning:**
Having already made clear that those who practice compassion will prevail,
while those who act recklessly will perish—
this chapter speaks of teachings that are easy to know and easy to follow,
yet those who are confused do not understand.
Because they do not understand the *Dao*’s ultimate truth,
they cannot deeply grasp the warnings.
The *Dao*’s core principles are obscured to them,
still bound by ignorance and stagnation—
thus, few know me.

If one can follow the *Dao* as a guiding principle,
then sincerity is most precious.
One who wears coarse garments yet harbors refined virtue
is no mere layperson—this is evident.
The *Dao* is easy to know,
yet those who do not know it are truly foolish.
Those who do not know yet force themselves to know,
the sage does not accept.
This is why the chapter is placed here to clarify.

My words are very easy to know,
My deeds are very easy to follow.

**Annotation:**
The *Laojun* says:
"My spoken words accord with the *Dao*’s principles, hence they are easy to know;
My affairs are simple, hence they are easy to follow."

**Commentary:**
The *Laojun*’s words mean:
That which I speak is meant to clarify the *Dao*—
when the *Dao* is clarified, words are forgotten, hence they are easy to know.
That which I do pertains to the realm of *wuwei*—
when affairs are simple, there is no forced action, hence they are easy to follow.

**Meaning:**
"I" refers to *Laojun*.
This chapter clarifies the two *Jing*’s teachings—
the sage’s words on the Three Treasures and Four Benevolences,
on frugality, yielding, humility, and compassion—
all are truly easy to know and easy to follow,
capable of regulating the self and the state.
Taking *wuwei* as the foundation,
and tranquility as the root—
when one is tranquil and without forced action,
affairs are simple and the *Dao* flows freely.
To know them is very easy,
to practice them is surely not difficult.

Yet none under Heaven can know them,
none can follow them.

**Annotation:**
People under Heaven are mired in words and do not awaken;
they are burdened by affairs and do not simplify,
hence none can know or follow them.

**Commentary:**
This laments that the multitude cannot fathom my words—
they cling to words and teachings, obscuring the *Dao*.
They are bewildered by verbal instruction,
hence they cannot know it.
They cannot awaken to affairs—
they cling to affairs and are mired in worldly matters,
hence they cannot follow it.

**Meaning:**
How could they not be confused by the pursuit of worldly gain and reckless aggression,
unable to practice frugality, yielding, humility, and compassion?
Since they cannot know it,
how could they follow it?

Moreover, the sage’s Five Thousand-word teachings,
though profound in accord with the *Zhongxuan Dao*,
still guide the world and lead the common folk.
His affairs are only simple and essential—
without forced action, they are easy to awaken to;
without worldly entanglements, they are easy to follow.
Yet abandoning the path of *wuwei* and simplicity,
they cling to rigid teachings and stagnant words,
thus falling into confusion—
hence none can know it.
I urge the ruler and the worthy to awaken early.

This is *Laojun*’s admonition and encouragement.

Words have a core principle,
Affairs have a sovereign ruler.

**Annotation:**
Words dwell in the *Dao*—
when the *Dao* is attained, words are forgotten,
thus the core of words is in the absence of words.
Affairs pertain to function—
when the task is complete, it is abandoned,
thus the sovereign ruler of affairs is in the absence of affairs.

**Commentary:**
This reverses the explanation of why easy-to-know and easy-to-follow teachings have their core principle.
"Sovereign ruler" means master.
Words dwell in the *Dao*—
when the *Dao* is attained, words are forgotten,
thus the core of words is in the absence of words.
Affairs pertain to function—
when the task is complete, it is abandoned,
thus the master of affairs is in the absence of affairs.
Is this not very easy to know and easy to follow?

**Meaning:**
Awakening to the core of words without words,
one’s understanding is easy—
thus, the core is most precious.
Awakening to the absence of affairs in affairs,
one’s practice is easy—
thus, the master is most precious.

Yet few can know me,
so those who do are truly noble.

**Annotation:**
Those who awaken to my words and forget knowledge are few.
Those who follow my wordless teachings are most noble.

**Commentary:**
"Few" means "rare."
"Follow" means "to take as a model."
*Laojun* says that those who awaken to my wordless teachings
and forget knowledge are exceedingly rare.
If one can take my wordless teachings as a model
and practice them,
then one may be honored as noble.

**Meaning:**
To know the core of wordless teachings is already rare.
To embody my wordless teachings as a guiding principle,
this is truly noble.
Yet the teachings themselves are wordless,
so words are needed to clarify the *Dao*.
The teachings themselves are without affairs,
so affairs are needed to explore the *Dao*’s mysteries.
To clarify the *Dao* is to forget words,
to explore the *Dao*’s mysteries is to simplify affairs.
When words are forgotten and affairs are simplified,
one may speak of the *Dao*.
Thus, the sage wears coarse garments yet harbors refined virtue.

**Annotation:**
One who wears coarse garments conceals his outward appearance,
one who harbors refined virtue clarifies his inward essence—
thus, few know me.

**Commentary:**
*Pran* (褐) is *qiu* (裘), the coarse clothing of the humble.
Layered coarse garments are used to cover the vulgarity of the lower classes.
*Yu* (玉) is pure and smooth,
and may be likened to the virtue of the noble person—
this phrase means to reveal that the sage’s inner wisdom is bright,
while his outward demeanor appears simple.

With the appearance of feigned simplicity, the sage is said to wear coarse garments,
with the mind of enlightened wisdom, he is said to harbor jade.

In meaning:
The sage’s relation to the *Dao* is such that
concealment and revelation share the same path,
retreat and engagement leave the same trace,
speech and silence both accord—
never for a moment does he stray.

Yet common folk cannot fathom the sage’s profound depths.
His wisdom encompasses all actions,
his virtue surpasses the Nine Celestial Purities,
he governs the principle of *wuwei*,
and penetrates the essence of unity-in-forgetting.
Externally, he obscures his purpose,
leaving no trace, blending with the harmonious light,
internally, his clarity shines bright,
discerning the depths and reaching the distant.

Thus, the Master of the Yellow River commented:
*"Though internally luminous, externally he appears as foolish and crude."*

A pearl lies hidden within the oyster,
fine jade is found within the stone—
this is the meaning of *wearing coarse garments while harboring jade*.

The *Dao* is supremely clear,
yet the vulgar and ignorant remain blind to it.

Again, Zhuangzi said:
*"Without doors or barriers, it opens in all four directions, vast and boundless—
how could this not be clarity?"*

The heart of the *Dao* is subtle—
wherever it goes, it reaches.

Yet the lesser scholars are confused by it.

The one who wears coarse garments
is the sage blending his outward self—
*qiu* (coarse garments) are the humble attire of the common folk,
with which he aligns himself.

The one who harbors jade
is the sage illuminating his inner self—
for jade, a beauty found within stone, possesses five virtues:

Its smoothness and warmth reflect humanity’s measure;
its polished angles reveal the inner from the outer—
this is the way of righteousness;
its resonant, far-reaching tones embody wisdom;
its unyielding yet breakable nature embodies courage;
its sharp edges, unadorned, embody purity.

Jade as a metaphor for virtue is described in the *Rites of Zhou* [□ *Yǔ Máo*]:
*"The ancient noble person must wear jade.
The right side, marked with *jiao* (angles), harmonizes with the people and things;
the left side, marked with *gong* and *yu*, governs the ruler and affairs."*

The swift step with *càiqí* [wild watercress] in hand—
this is the conduct of the gate’s outer path.

To walk with ease in *sìxià* [summer’s ease]—
this is the joy of ascending the hall.

To circle within the compass’s rule—
this is the return of proper conduct.

To bend within the square’s measure—
this is the way of curved movement.

To advance, one bows with a slight dip—
this is called the small *fǔn* [humble bend].

To retreat, one lifts with a slight rise—
this is called the small *yáng* [elevated step].

Then the jade resounds in clear tones.

Thus, the noble person in his carriage hears the harmonious *luánhé* [bell-chime] sound,
and when walking, the jade’s chime rings—
so that no wayward heart may find entrance.

The heir-apparent or prince, when not in mourning,
wears his jade on the left, bound tight—
so that it does not chime.

Set on the right, it is removed;
when at rest, it is displayed;
when in court, it is bound tight—
for in the presence of the lord, it must not chime.

At the *qí* [ceremonial assembly], the jade is bound and bent—
this is the act of submission.

In all cases, the belt must bear jade—
except in mourning, for this speaks of royal rites.

The jade’s *chōngyá* [central teeth] ornament:
the noble person, without cause,
never lets the jade leave his person—
comparing himself to jade’s virtue.

Mourning and calamity are called *gu* [cause].

The Son of Heaven wears white jade with black silk cords,
the duke and marquis wear mountain-black jade with vermilion silk cords,
the great officer wears water-blue jade with plain silk cords,
the heir-apparent wears *yú* [jade-like] jade with *qí* [variegated] silk cords,
the scholar wears *wěiměi* [dark and lustrous] jade with coarse silk cords.
Confucius wore an elephant-tusk ring, five inches wide, with *qí* [variegated] fine cords—
for the unadorned ring symbolizes humility,
showing he does not seek office.

The ring is chosen for its endless, unbroken cycle.

**Chapter 71: Knowing the Unknown**

The *cū* [exposition] states: The previous chapter expounds the teaching of clear understanding, showing its ease. This chapter reveals the knowing of the heart—emptiness and forgetting are supreme. It begins by marking the difference between delusion and enlightenment, for clinging to delusion breeds illness. Only the Sage, recognizing this illness as a disease, does not force knowledge.

The *yì* [meaning] says: Earlier, it was said that knowing the Way is precious, yet one must conceal traces and hide brilliance. Now, it is said that forcing knowledge is wrong, and one must forget knowing to align with the Dao. The Sage does not indulge in the disease of forcing knowledge, hence remains undiseased. If a traveler comprehends this Sage-heart, what illness remains?

Knowing the unknown—this is supreme.
Not knowing what is known—this is illness.

**Annotation:** Realizing the emptiness of *dharma*-nature, it is not the knowing of *dharma*. In knowing, to forget knowing—this is virtue’s summit. Not knowing *dharma* as known, its true nature is empty. In knowing, to force knowing—this is the disease of action.

The *cū* states: *Dharma*-nature is inherently empty, yet not the knowing of *dharma*. The Sage awakens to this, possessing a knowing that does not cling to forms—thus, it is said that not knowing is virtue’s summit. This explains enlightenment.

As for the illness of not knowing what is known: common folk do not know *dharma* as known, which is not true reality. In this logic of non-knowing, they falsely claim knowledge, binding themselves through attachment—thus, it is the disease of action. This refutes delusion.

The *yì* says: To realize that knowing is not knowing—this is true knowing. Knowing while not knowing—this is called supreme. Not knowing true knowing yet forcing knowledge—this is called illness. The Sage, realizing all is false, cultivates true essence, in knowing forgets knowing, and thus extinguishes the disease of forcing knowledge. Only by treating the disease does one not fall ill.

**Annotation:** Only by treating the disease of forcing knowledge does one not become its victim. The *cū* states: Ordinary beings force knowledge, generating false perceptions and becoming afflicted. Only by treating the disease of forcing knowledge, in knowing forgetting knowing, does one not become its victim—thus, it is said one does not fall ill.

The *yì* says: To know the disease of forcing knowledge and treat it—thus one does not fall ill—because there is no disease of forcing knowledge. The Sage does not fall ill because they treat the disease; thus, they do not fall ill.

**Annotation:** Only the Sage does not fall ill because they treat the disease of others’ forcing knowledge; thus, they do not fall ill.

The *cū* states: The Sage’s wisdom is complete and luminous, realizing true suchness, in knowing forgetting knowing—thus, they are not afflicted by knowledge. This is because they treat the disease. Ordinary beings have the disease of forcing knowledge, so true knowing is spoken to dispel it. Once the disease of false knowing is removed, the medicine of true knowing is also discarded—thus, it is said one does not fall ill.

The *yì* says: Common folk, with shallow understanding, have not realized the truth of true knowing, yet cling to the error of forcing knowledge. In this cycle, they lose true wisdom. The Sage’s wisdom is complete, not clinging to forcing knowledge, yet realizing the truth of true knowing, able to treat the disease of forcing knowledge, not bewildered by its knowing. By treating the disease, they do not fall ill.

As if one bewildered were to speak of the Great Dao—whether they cling to having or to non-having. The one who clings to non-having falls ill from having; the one who clings to having falls ill from non-having. The Sage knows knowing is neither having nor non-having, taking no side, able to treat what is clung to—thus, they do not fall ill. The meaning is the same.

Thus, the great discourse arrives at knowing-forgetting-knowing. Yanzi feigned stupidity; Kong Guang was gentle and restrained, thrice sealing his lips in caution—this is what is meant.

The *Xīshēng Jīng* [Scripture of Ascending West] says: *Néng zhī wú zhī* [Ability to know non-knowing]—this is the pivot of the Dao.

---

**Chapter 72: The People Do Not Fear Authority**

The *cū* states: The previous chapter expounded the knowing of the heart, with emptiness and forgetting as supreme. This chapter reveals the disease of delusion—there is authority to be feared. It begins by marking that if the people do not fear authority, calamity will follow. Next, it urges humility to quiet desires: the spirit is not weary of people. Finally, it cites the Sage’s conduct to demonstrate taking and discarding.

The *yì* says: The Sage, in knowing forgetting knowing, having shown forcing knowledge as illness, further cites the authority that should be feared. If one does not fear great wealth and authority, let them purify their thoughts, empty their hearts, dwell their spirit at the *Jiānguān* [Vermilion Pass], cultivate *qi* in tranquility, savor the Dao in the mysterious void. When spirit and body harmonize, all desires are abandoned, and the afflictions of narrowness and aversion are cast off, taking knowing and love as resources.

Then, with courage in humility and gentleness, they temper their rigidity and decisiveness, making this the path to cultivating true essence.

If the people do not fear authority, great authority arrives.

**Annotation:** What is authoritative and worthy of fear is called *wēi* [authority]. It is said that if one does not fear small matters, is careless in caution, then great and fearful authority will come.

The *cū* states: What is authoritative and worthy of fear is called *wēi*. The coming of desires and aversions begins in trivial matters, accumulating into afflictions, becoming great authority. If one does not attend to the subtle and minute, then great and fearful authority will come.

The *yì* says: The noble person has three fears: fear of Heaven’s mandate, fear of great worthies, and fear of the Sage’s words. Again, establishing oneself requires taking fear as foundation. Governing the state with fear brings order to the four seasons, harmony to the six *qì* [energies], exchange with the numinous, and prosperity for the realm. Those without fear lack this exchange, and disasters arise. In governing oneself with fear, officials act rightly, families are at peace, and illness and discord do not arise while the will and *qi* remain balanced. Those without fear do the opposite, and great authority arrives—this is irreversible.

Do not dwell in narrowness,

**Annotation:** Where the spirit resides is the heart. Not dwelling in narrowness means eliminating emotion and desire, making it empty and pure.

The *cū* states: Where the spirit resides is the heart. One must forget emotion, discard desire, widen and soften the breast, making the inner chambers tranquil and at ease, so the spirit may dwell in the heart, and life may be preserved.

The *Yì* states: The spirit is the sovereign of the body, the heart is the palace of the soul. If cravings do not enter, and distinctions between self and other are forgotten, if right and wrong do not linger in the breast, then the spirit dwells in the soul’s palace.

The *Xī Shēng Jīng* says: To plot in peril is the beginning of peril—peril is what will not endure long. This teaches one to sever thought and abandon private desires, to be few in self and meager in craving.

It further says: The body is the spirit’s chariot, the spirit’s dwelling, the spirit’s master. When the master is tranquil, the spirit abides; when agitated, the spirit departs. Since the heart can shift between stillness and motion, it is called spirit. The spirit can fly and move mountains—this is why it is called the numinous and wondrous. The spirit’s power is vast, beyond thought or discussion. Thus, through the Three Rapid Steps and the Great Void Practice, one attains the cloud-chariot and dragon-drawn carriage, entering without trace and exiting without return, ascending to the Three Pure Ones, commanding water and fire, moving mountains and sinking earth—what cannot be done? If used contrary to the Dao, it brings ruin to the realm and the body, sinking into the Six Desires, drifting through suffering realms, cycling through birth and death. Good and evil, fortune and misfortune—all arise from the heart. Hence, the heart is the soul’s palace.

Do not weary what gives you life.
**Annotation:** What the body produces is the spirit. To not weary means to be few in self and meager in craving, so as not to labor or exhaust.
**Cū:** What the body produces is the spirit. *Yàn* means evil. Since humans are born from spirit, it is called what gives life. The numinous delights in emptiness and stillness; humans must purify the heart and still the mind, and the spirit will return of its own accord. If one indulges cravings and defiles the spirit, scheming and slipping into licentiousness, then vital essence and *qi* will scatter and dissipate. When they scatter and dissipate, desire arises—thus, it is urged to not weary what gives life, to preserve the way of enduring longevity.

The *Yì* states: The body’s birth comes from receiving the Dao and being endowed with spirit to form its shape. The spirit is the subtle interplay of yin and yang; the form is the substance of yin; the *qi* is the numinous essence of yang. Once the body is born, it relies on the spirit to move and on *qi* to bend and stretch. When spirit and *qi* are whole, life endures; when they perish, death comes. Thus, the form is the spirit’s dwelling, and the spirit is the form’s master. How could one weary and abandon it?

Moreover, what gives life to the body is roughly threefold: first, essence; second, spirit; third, *qi*. At the beginning of birth, the Dao endows it with *qi*, Heaven with spirit, and Earth with essence. The three combine to form the shape. If one receives essence, nourishes *qi*, and preserves spirit, then one may attain unity and longevity. If they scatter and dissipate, confusion and illness arise; if they are exhausted, death follows. To not cherish these three is to scatter and abandon them. When *qi* scatters and spirit departs, the body will die. How could one fail to guard and preserve them?

These three can give life to the body, hence they are called what gives life. Only because one does not weary them does one not weary them.
**Annotation:** Only because humans do not weary the spirit does the spirit not weary humans.
**Cū:** The *shàn* says: "Borrowing" means "lending"; "endowment" means "receiving." *Ou* means "filth," *yī* means "oneness." If one eliminates filth and ceases thought, being solely precise and unified, the spirit will not weary humans, hence it is said that they do not weary each other.

The *Yì* states: *Dài* means "to lend"; *zī* means "to receive." *Ou* means "evil"; *yī* means "oneness."

Only those who cultivate the Dao/Way
nurture the spirit and cherish the *qi*,
with a tranquil mind in emptiness and stillness,
shall the spirit abide eternally.
When the spirit does not weary humans,
humans may endure long.

Those who eliminate filth and cease thought—
this is the admonition of Laozi in the *Western Ascension Scripture*,
as he prepared to ascend to Taiwei and warned Yin Xi:
*"Eliminate filth, cease thought,
calm the heart, and hold to oneness.
When all filth is removed and all matters concluded,
this is the essence of my Dao."*

Those who are solely precise and unified—
this is the command of Shun in the *Shū Jing* ["Great Yu’s Model" passage],
as he entrusted Yu with the throne:
*"Human desires are perilous,
the Dao/Way is subtle.
Perilous, then difficult to secure;
subtle, then difficult to discern.
Only by being solely precise and unified
can one steadfastly grasp the mean."*

Thus, the Sage knows oneself without revealing oneself.
**Cū:** Knowing oneself means inward reflection and self-examination,
preventing harm in its inception,
so that no fearful matters arise.
Not revealing oneself means not flaunting one’s innate virtue,
nor boasting to others, lest one violate principle and lose constancy,
thereby inviting calamity.
**Yì:** Truly, humans do not flaunt their abilities,
nor display their deeds.
Thus, the *Shū Jing* says:
*"Only by not arrogating,
does no one dispute your merit.
Only by not vaunting,
does no one dispute your virtue."*

But by inwardly containing light and encompassing all under heaven,
there are no fearful matters at all.
When one’s cultivation reaches this point,
virtue and power flourish, and fame and achievement manifest.
Yet one does not exalt oneself.

**Zhù:** Knowing oneself means recognizing one’s body
and guarding against what should be feared.
Loving oneself means not wearying the spirit.
Not revealing one’s abilities prevents inviting disaster,
nor exalting oneself to gather resentment.

**Cū:** The Sage preserves oneself,
loves their body,
and abandons all desires,
so that the spirit is not weary.
Not exalting oneself means not arrogantly esteeming one’s body,
nor oppressing others to gather resentment.

**Yì:** Nurturing harmony and conserving the spirit,
rarely speaking and nourishing the *qi*,
abandoning desires and restraining appetites,
suppressing excess and eliminating evil—
this is self-love.
Light furs, fat horses, sweet food, fine garments,
ornate halls and grand staircases,
towering pavilions and spacious dwellings—
this is self-exaltation.
Self-love brings spirit at ease and heart serene,
while self-exaltation harms the people and gathers resentment,
draining wealth and provoking grievance.
Thus it is said:
*"The Dao-governed ruler finds joy in bringing joy to others,
while the non-Dao-governed ruler finds joy in indulging themselves.
Joy for others, and others follow;
joy for oneself, and others rebel."*

Thus, abandon the latter and embrace the former.
**Zhù:** Abandon what exalts, embrace what loves.
**Cū:** Abandon self-revelation and self-exaltation,
embrace self-knowledge and self-love.

The Sage attains equal wisdom and comprehends the emptiness of dharma-nature,
with no need for abandonment or acquisition.
Yet teaching the common folk through metaphor,
this is but figurative speech.

**Yì:** Those who reveal themselves are unclear,
those who exalt themselves do not endure.
Thus, exaltation is to treat the body as the world,
as if it could be entrusted with the world.
Hence, the Sage abandons it without taking it.
Those who know themselves are clear,
those who love themselves are at peace.
Thus it is said:
*"Love with the body as the world,
as if it could be entrusted with the world,"*
speaking of the Sage’s inner love for the spirit
and outer love for the people.

Figurative speech is to lodge meaning in words
to teach the spirit and the common folk.
It is said the Sage does not act with abandonment or acquisition,
but establishes principle to exhort others.

*End of Volume Forty-Six of the Broad Explication of the Dao/Way and Virtue Scripture*
*Volume Forty-Seven of the Broad Explication of the Dao/Way and Virtue Scripture*

**Volume Forty-Seven of the Broad Explication of the Dao/Way and Virtue Scripture**

**Chapter Seventy-Three: On the Perils of Boldness**

**Explication:**
The preceding chapter reveals the affliction of delusion and the awe-inspiring threat it holds.
This chapter elucidates how boldness brings ruin to the body.
First, it distinguishes between daring and not daring, contrasting their benefits and harms.
Next, it expounds the Dao’s principle of modesty and gentleness, admonishing against reckless daring.
Finally, it laments the retribution of Heaven’s net, urging virtuous scholars to cultivate refinement.

**Meaning:**
Previously, it was taught to reject outward displays of detachment and to embrace inner cultivation of self-knowledge and love.
Now, it exhorts one to retreat with boldness to preserve the body,
and warns against advancing with boldness to harm one’s virtue.
By illustrating benefits and harms, it dispels excess and advocates for modesty and gentleness,
thus fulfilling the merit of refining virtue and expanding the essence of non-action and non-contention.

It demonstrates Heaven’s net of retribution,
so that all may strive for cultivation,
yet marks the fear of death
to instill dread of the consequences of recklessness.

Boldness in daring leads to death,
boldness in restraint leads to life.
**Annotation:**
*Daring* refers to decisive boldness—
when one is bold in decisive action,
loses modesty and gentleness,
and fails to yield,
harm befalls the body,
hence it is said to lead to death.
Restraint, however, allows one to govern the body properly.

**Explication:**
Firmness and decisiveness constitute boldness;
boldness without restraint is daring.
Those who are bold yet reckless,
crashing against authority and stirring chaos,
follow the path of self-destruction,
hence it is said: *Boldness in daring leads to death.*
Boldness in restraint leads to life—
when one acts with caution,
withdraws the body,
and knows when to retreat,
avoiding reckless aggression and misfortune,
that is the path of self-preservation.
Thus it is said: *Boldness in restraint leads to life.*

**Meaning:**
The reckless advance with sharp resolve,
inviting calamity upon themselves.
The modest retreat with care,
safeguarding their true nature and enduring.
The two paths—death and life—
are clearly distinguishable in their outcomes.

Those who defy authority and incite disorder:
*The Analects* (of Confucius) says,
*"There has never been one who does not love to defy authority yet loves to incite disorder."*
The bold defy their own superiors,
while filial and fraternal piety compels reverence and submission;
few dare to defy their superiors.
Thus one must discern the two paths—
one brings harm, the other benefit.
**Explication:**
The two paths—
daring and restraint.
When one knows that daring brings harm and restraint brings benefit,
they must choose boldness in restraint.

Though both are forms of boldness,
their applications differ,
hence one brings harm, the other benefit.

**Meaning:**
Firmness and decisiveness in the heart
are both termed boldness.
Boldness that advances recklessly invites harm,
boldness that retreats with modesty invites benefit.
Benefit brings life, harm brings death.
Life and death arise from the heart’s response,
harm and benefit stem from false emotions.

If one can boldly retreat to preserve the body,
and modestly refine their cultivation,
that is the essence of the Dao.
Though false emotions may provoke,
fortune and misfortune are not constant,
hence it is said: *All may bring harm or benefit.*

Heaven detests what it detests—
who can fathom its purpose?
**Annotation:**
The two paths—
daring and restraint.
Some bring benefit, others harm—
one must choose boldness in restraint.
Those who dare recklessly invite harm,
while Heaven detests their ways—
who can truly know its purpose?

**Explication:**
*Who* means *whoever*.
*Purpose* here refers to the ultimate consequence.
The bold and daring, those who act recklessly,
invite harm at every turn,
contrary to Heaven’s Dao.
Yet common folk—
who can grasp Heaven’s intent?

**Meaning:**
Heaven’s Dao abhors killing and cherishes life,
abhors vice and cherishes virtue.
Boldness in advancing invites calamity and death,
boldness in retreating invites benefit and life.
This is the natural order—
who can comprehend its purpose?

This admonishes one to embrace bold restraint,
to preserve their life.

Heaven’s Dao does not contend yet triumphs in virtue,
**Annotation:**
Below, it expounds Heaven’s Dao of modesty,
admonishing against human boldness.
Heaven does not contend with things,
as the four seasons wax and wane—
nothing resists its course,
hence virtue naturally prevails.

**Explication:**
Following the discussion of Heaven’s detestations,
these four sentences further elucidate Heaven’s Dao of modesty,
admonishing against human boldness.
Humans harbor the boldness of victory,
thus they contend.
Heaven’s Dao is evenly bestowed,
favoring only the virtuous,
and nothing resists it,
hence virtue prevails.

**Meaning:**
Heaven’s Dao follows natural spontaneity,
without striving for victory or defeat.
The four seasons succeed one another,
acting without command,
the six qi shift and transform,
acting without speech yet trusted.
If things do not defy Heaven,
virtue naturally prevails.

*Heaven favors only the virtuous*
is found in Chapter Forty-Three of this Scripture:
*"Heaven’s Dao has no favorites,
yet always aids the virtuous."*

*Heaven’s Dao is evenly bestowed*
is seen in the *Book of Changes* (Yijing):
*"The virtuous person, with compassion for the many and generosity to the few,
bestows things in accordance with their nature—
this is even bestowal."*

Heaven does not speak yet virtue responds,
**Annotation:**
How does Heaven speak?
It bestows blessings on the virtuous and calamities on the licentious—
never differing in its response.
Thus it is said: *Virtue responds.*

**Explication:**
How does Heaven speak?
It merely bestows blessings on the virtuous and calamities on the licentious,
with fortune and misfortune arising in response.
Thus it is said: *Heaven does not speak yet virtue responds.*

The *Explication* states:

Heaven speaks not, yet the four seasons march upon the earth,
and speaks not, yet all things are born.
They flourish in their season,
and respond to things—
this is the principle of Nature itself.

The *Scripture of the Western Ascension* says:
*"Do good, and virtuous qi arrives;
do evil, and malevolent qi arrives."*
The natural momentum is as inevitable as the echo of a sound—
never erring.

As for the bestowal of blessings on the virtuous and calamities on the licentious,
the *Book of Documents* (on King Tang’s admonitions) states:
*"Bless the virtuous and punish the licentious,"*
meaning that the governance of a state and the conduct of its people
have both virtue and vice—
the virtuous are blessed by Heaven,
the wicked are punished by Heaven.

Heaven sends omens to warn them,
and signs to awaken them,
yet if they remain oblivious, then calamity befalls them.
This is the response of fortune and misfortune,
summoned by humanity itself.

If it comes without being summoned,
**Annotation:**
Heaven does not compel things to follow its will;
things cannot defy it—
they come naturally, in accordance with Heaven.

**Explication:**
All things arise from being called forth by fate.
Yet Heaven does not summon them,
yet they follow of their own accord,
as in the case of yin embracing yang—
spring’s birth and summer’s growth,
all coming without being summoned.

The *Explication* states:
The *Spring and Autumn Annals, Zuo Tradition* says:
*"Fortune and misfortune have no door—
they are summoned by humanity alone."*
To do evil summons calamity,
to do good invites blessing—
this is the constant principle.

Now, when it is said that Heaven responds without speaking,
and comes without being summoned,
it means that all things naturally conform to Heaven.

*"Yin embracing yang"*—
these are the words of Chapter Five of this Scripture.

*繟然而善谋.*
**Annotation:**
Heaven’s Dao is profound and vast,
*繟* in its breadth and patience,
manifesting symbols and transformations
for humanity to emulate—
hence, *"well-planned."*

**Explication:**
Heaven’s Dao governs the four seasons,
hanging the calendar’s symbols,
cycling in harmony with the seasons
to demonstrate to humanity.
The calendar’s symbols never fail their regularity,
the four seasons never falter in their responses—
cold and heat, darkness and light—
without the slightest deviation.

This is *繟* in its expansiveness and patience,
and *"well-planned"* in its measured course.
*繟* means vast and broad,
*谋* means regulation.
*历* means reckoning,
*象* means law.
*变* refers to celestial changes,
*差忒* to deviations.

Heaven, through its regulated cycles and symbolic laws,
displays them to humanity.
The Sage follows Heaven’s symbols to establish teachings.
Thus, the *Classic of Rites, Sequence* says:
*"In ancient times, under Emperor Yao,
the calendar was set by the sun and moon,
and the seasons were respectfully taught to the people."*

Heaven’s net is vast and wide,
yet nothing escapes its grasp.

**Annotation:**
Though Heaven’s net is vast and distant,
its rewards for virtue and punishments for vice
are precise to the smallest measure.

**Explication:**
*恢恢* means vast and broad.
This elucidates the earlier discussion of Heaven’s Dao.

Though Heaven’s net is vast and far-reaching,
its rewards for virtue and punishments for vice
never fail by even a hair’s breadth.

The *Explication* states:
Ancient people wove cords into nets and snares
to capture flying and running creatures.
The net signifies its encompassing, expansive nature.

Heaven, through the responses of fortune and misfortune,
the cycles of yin and yang,
and the retributions of virtue and vice,
encompasses all things in its net—
nothing can escape or hide within it.
The virtuous are rewarded for their virtue,
the wicked are punished for their evil—
hence, it is called *Heaven’s Net*.

Heaven does not harm things—
thus, the net encompasses and captures them,
as a metaphor for its form.

Heaven endows things with *qi*,
and things receive *qi* from Heaven,
taking form from the earth—
thus, Heaven and Earth are the origins of all things.
The virtue, vice, life, and death of things
all stem from Heaven’s decree.
Heaven does not use nets or mechanisms to control things—
only vast and far-reaching,
encompassing all without exception.

Flying, walking, plants, winds, clouds, *qi* and omens,
yin and yang, cold and heat,
day and night, life and death—
all are within its embrace,
nothing escapes or is lost.
Thus, it is like a net that ensnares all.

Its *qi* responds precisely,
its seasons advance without fail—
the calendar’s reckonings are clear,
never deviating by even a hair’s breadth.
*Hair* refers to the finest of threads,
*divisions* to the subtlest of measures.
Heaven’s net captures even the most minute details.

**Chapter Seventy-Four: The People Do Not Fear Death**
**Explication:**
The previous chapter clarifies that daring action leads to self-inflicted ruin.
This chapter explains that action invites death,
necessitating the punishment of the executioner.
The first five sentences outline the warning against using capital punishment.
The next sentence identifies the executioner’s role.
The last four sentences argue that using punishment as a substitute for killing
inevitably leads to error.

The *Explication* states:
To reward virtue with *virtue/power*,
and to punish evil with law—
this is like the impartiality of cold and heat,
or the inevitability of yin and yang’s responses—
this is Heaven’s Dao.

The sovereign, without action, governs from the throne,
and the people know how to inspire themselves.
If one cultivates the Dao in conduct,
Heaven bestows boundless years.
Each attains their natural allotment,
and surely enjoys great longevity—
this depends on reverence in the heart
and fear in the face of calamity,
avoiding the net that ensnares the body,
how could one then suffer the executioner’s doom?

For the state, it means leniency in punishment,
compassion in judicial scrutiny,
not resorting to capital punishment as a substitute—
thus, there will be no harm to the innocent,
nor the use of execution as a political tool—
thus, there will be no resentment among the harmonious.
Then, abandoning heavy taxation and meddling governance,
following the path of non-contentious retreat,
to continue the intent of the preceding chapters—
this is blessing for the people.

The people do not fear death—
why then threaten them with death?

**Annotation:**
If one indulges desires and stumbles into peril,
habitualizing it without fear—
how could the sovereign instead establish laws of execution
to instill terror through killing?

**Explication:**
It is said that people cannot uphold the Dao of tranquility,
but instead indulge desires,
stumbling into peril,
making it habitual without fear.
The sovereign should guide them through the Dao of tranquility—
why instead impose laws of execution
to instill terror through killing?

The *Explication* states:
Though the sovereign may set forth symbols in harmony with Heaven
and establish laws to govern the throne,
the essence lies in nurturing things and completing undertakings,
applying the Dao to teach the people.

If the people scorn the law and disrupt the norms,
transgressing punishments in their prohibitions,
casting themselves into the net,
without heed for their own bodies—
they should also be awakened to abandon their thoughts and purify their hearts,
forsaking evil and embracing good,
so that they may repent and reform,
and be permitted to begin anew.
Yet they should not be hastily subjected to the **Five Punishments**,
nor be pressed from the **Three Sides**.

This is where the fear of losing **benevolence and forgiveness** lies.

If one makes the people habitually fear death,
yet there are those who act deceitfully—
I could seize and kill them,
who would dare to do otherwise?
**Annotation:**
If all were to follow the Dao of tranquility,
daring not to drown in desires or indulge in passions,
habitually fearing death—
yet there were one who acted deceitfully,
I could seize and kill this deceitful individual,
who would dare to resist?
Thus the following passage states:

**Explication:**
This illustrates the sovereign’s Dao of **non-action**,
where people restrain their desires,
each preserving their lives,
habitually fearing death.
Yet if there is one who acts deceitfully and wickedly,
and I could seize and kill them—
who would dare to do so?
This is why I do not kill them myself,
for there is the **Heavenly Net** that governs killing.

Thus the following passage states:

**Meaning:**
Having taught with benevolence and forgiveness,
the people know their guidance,
preserving their bodies in reverence for the law,
practicing purity in conduct and life,
completely abandoning desires and passions,
all fearing death.
Yet if some persist in indulging their desires,
transgressing the law and incurring punishment,
the sovereign should still caution them to reform,
and open the Dao to them.
If they remain obstinate and do not return—
even then, do not hastily seize and kill them,
but await the **Heavenly Net**’s judgment.

This is how the sovereign demonstrates **good persuasion**.

There are always those who govern the **Heavenly Net** in killing.
**Annotation:**
Such deceitful individuals—
the Heavenly Net will not fail them,
for it is the **Heavenly Net** that governs killing.

**Explication:**
**司 (sī)** means to oversee.
Heaven’s discernment is profound and clear,
nothing escapes its gaze.
Deceitful individuals who do not meet their end—
this is the **Heavenly Net**’s governance of killing.

**Meaning:**
Heaven’s nurturing of people is vast,
its love for them is boundless.
The **Southern Palace** (of **Danju Registers**) rewards virtue and governs life,
the **Northern Palace** (of **Black Ledgers**) records transgressions and governs death.
Heaven, Earth, and myriad deities oversee good and evil,
punishing and encouraging,
so that people may abandon vice and cultivate virtue.
Thus, those with merit have their years extended,
those with guilt have their **lifespan (suàn)** diminished—
not a single measure is lost,
like the **Yang Officials**’ examination.

Heaven has the **Four Stars of Governing Life and Death**:
the **Two Stars of Life and Death** overseeing a person’s merit and guilt,
their lifespan and rewards;
the **Two Stars of Fortune** overseeing a person’s rank, wealth, and sustenance;
the **Two Stars of Danger** overseeing a person’s arrogance and unrighteousness;
the **Two Stars of Transgression** overseeing a person’s deceit, excess, and private wrongdoings.
These four stars are what the *Three Elements Scripture* calls
the **Heavenly Net**’s governance of life and death,
adjusting retribution and fortune,
so that all people may know to cultivate virtue and avoid vice.

The sovereign teaches with goodness,
moving hearts with benevolence and forgiveness.
Yet those who are uniquely wicked—
the **Heavenly Net** will govern their own killing.
This is to say that Heaven’s illumination is clear,
nothing escapes its scrutiny.
The Heavenly Net is vast yet not lax,
who can evade its retribution?
**孔 (kǒng)** means profound.
If the sovereign governs killing himself,
this is called **usurping the Heavenly Net’s authority**.

**Annotation:**
If the sovereign personally executes killing,
he will not align with Heaven’s principles,
just as a clumsy man usurping the **Great Carpenter**’s axe
will only harm the wood.

**Explication:**
The **Great Carpenter** wields his axe with precision,
each cut conforming to the square and round.
If a clumsy man takes his place,
he must deviate from the plumb line,
how could he not damage the wood and injure his own hands?
The Heavenly Net’s principles are clear and unyielding.
If the sovereign governs killing himself,
how could he not harm the people and forfeit Heaven’s harmony?
Why then would he threaten them with death?
This is what the passage means.

**Meaning:**
The **Great Carpenter**’s skill is flawless,
his axe strikes with the force of wind,
no cut is ever misplaced.
A clumsy man taking his place—
both the wood and his hands are injured,
just as the sovereign seizing a uniquely wicked person
and hastening to execute them with the **beheading axe (yuè)**—
though he may wield the blade,
he truly risks harming **Heaven’s harmony**.
Thus the original passage’s intent:
If there are those who do not fear death,
the sovereign should open the Dao to them with goodness,
teach them with the Way,
how could he instead threaten them with death?
The *Book of Documents* says:
*"Better to spare the innocent than to punish the guilty,
better to overlook minor offenses than to execute the unworthy."*
This reflects the virtue of cherishing life,
deeply resonating with the people’s hearts.

**End of Volume Forty-Seven of *The True Scripture of Virtue and the Way* with Broad Explications**
**End of Volume Forty-Eight of *The True Scripture of Virtue and the Way* with Broad Explications**

**Chapter Seventy-Five: The People’s Hunger**
*Attributed to Master Guangcheng of Tang, recorded by Du Guangting*

**Exegesis:**
The previous chapter clarified that excessive governance leads to contempt for death, inviting censure from those who wield the axe of execution. This chapter reveals that heavy taxation impoverishes the people—an inevitable consequence of artificial intervention in life.

The first three sections repeatedly expose the root causes of this ruin. Only by embracing *wuwei* (non-action) can one truly honor life.

**Explanation:**
What does "governing with principle" entail?
Dao is the foundation, virtue its expression. To follow the Way is to remain still and clear; to wield virtue is to bring abundance and peace. Let the mind remain undisturbed as the One, yet attend to the needs of ten households. With frugality and restraint, the common folk flourish. Yet how can rulers gluttonously indulge in endless feasting, relentlessly exacting tribute? Men toil in the fields yet starve, women weave tirelessly yet shiver in cold. If governance forces them to despise life, driving them to this extremity—what greater sorrow is there?

Only by not overburdening life, allowing each to fulfill their proper role, can Heaven’s harmony be preserved—this is the true meaning of *guìshēng* (honoring life). Teach them the strength of gentleness, the resilience of softness, that they may embody and cultivate these truths.

**The people’s hunger stems from excessive taxation.**
*Annotation:* The world’s scarcity arises because rulers consume too much of the people’s tribute.

**Exegesis:**
The people are the foundation of the state. If governance is burdensome and taxes oppressive, the state’s root decays—and decay brings peril. Thus, the people’s poverty is the direct result of the ruler’s excessive consumption of tribute, leading to their hunger.

**Explanation:**
Laws and statutes have ancient precedents. Food sustains the ruler’s kitchen, taxes fund the state’s needs. The *shíyī* (tenth) tax should be light. Heavy taxes impoverish the people; light taxes sustain them. A prosperous people ensure a thriving state; a starving people invite national peril. Balance is the key—laws must not be excessively harsh. When punishments are severe, resentment festers; when military levies are excessive, the realm grows poor. The Marquis of Qi perished from oppressive taxation, while the House of Ji rose to dominance through generous patronage. These lessons are plain for all to see.

**The people are difficult to govern because their rulers interfere.**
*Annotation:* The world’s unruliness stems from the ruler’s artificial interventions. Excessive governance breeds deception, making order impossible.

**Exegesis:**
The masses rely on the ruler to govern them. The essence of governance lies in *wuwei*—trusting in natural harmony. Thus, when the ruler does nothing, the people transform of their own accord. Yet today, the people’s difficulty arises from the ruler’s interference. Excessive governance disrupts the people, spawning grand deceits, making order unattainable.

**Explanation:**
The ruler’s governance must begin with clarity and stillness. Avoid unnecessary actions, futile endeavors, and the ostentatious display of martial prowess or decadent craftsmanship. Let *wuwei* govern naturally, prioritizing tranquility—then deceit will not arise, and calamity will not take root. When laws are imposed, the people flee them; the Yin dynasty’s oaths sparked rebellion, the Zhou’s alliances bred suspicion.

Now, rulers externally flaunt military might, exhausting the people with forced labor, while internally indulging in luxury, draining them with exactions. Above, there is the gluttony of sumptuous feasts; below, the despair of insufficient gruel. Harsh decrees and oppressive demands make governance impossible.

**People despise death because they overindulge in life.**
*Annotation:* The world’s disregard for life stems from their excessive, unnatural pursuit of it.

**Exegesis:**
When people recklessly court death, abandoning life, it is because they violate natural limits in their desperate quest for existence. Ignoring the law, they risk everything for their desires—thus, they despise death.

**Explanation:**
Heaven nurtures life with fixed portions; longevity depends on proper nourishment and alignment with nature. Only by emptying the heart can the Dao be attained; by restraining desire, the mind remains steadfast. Then, Heaven’s light manifests, and life extends naturally without forced pursuit.

Yet if one overindulges in life—seeking immortality through poisonous elixirs, or damaging *qi* through reckless anger—if one hoards rare treasures or strains for impossible feats, the very pursuit of life becomes its undoing. This is the folly of *thickening life* (厚生).

Thus, a bird nesting in flames feels no cold;
a fish boiled in a cauldron pities no chill.
Nurturing life against reason harms it—
how pitiful the delusions of the world!

The Sage seeks to return to natural measure, not excess. Only those who do not obsess over life truly honor it.

*Annotation:* When natural allotment suffices, life is preserved. If one overnourishes beyond measure, life is lost. Thus, those who do not obsess over life surpass those who cling to it.

**Exegesis:**
Life has its limits. Contentment is enough. To exceed or defy these limits is folly. To seek life beyond its natural bounds is madness. Therefore, not overburdening life ensures its preservation; to obsess over life risks its loss. Thus, those who do not fret over life are wiser than those who cling to it.

**Explanation:**
Life is granted with fixed portions; fate has its constants. Upholding one’s role ensures longevity; violating it leads to ruin. Hence, the Sage warns against excessive pursuit of life. The wise understand this subtlety and trust in Heaven’s bestowal. This is why rulers must be cautioned: deviating from natural order harms the state and the people, while adhering to principle brings harmony and prosperity. Following the Dao and conforming to nature—this is the true path. It may be said that such rulers truly honor life and master the Way.

**Chapter Seventy-Six: The People’s Births**
**Exegesis:**
The previous chapter revealed that heavy taxation impoverishes the people, demonstrating the ruin of artificial governance.

**Chapter Seventy-Six: The People’s Births**

This chapter reveals that artificial governance breeds desire, thus losing the gentle harmony of *qi*.
First, it distinguishes between those who cling to life and those who accept death.
Next, it offers two analogies from grass and trees.
It concludes by warning against excessive strength, urging one to uphold gentleness and yielding.

**Exegesis:**
The previous chapter taught that the wise do not cling excessively to life, avoiding overindulgence.
This chapter advocates instead for cultivating weakness to preserve harmony and gentleness.
It demonstrates that rigidity cannot be sustained, while humility is the proper course.
Army strength becomes a nation’s ruin; trees wither when their *qi* decays.
It exhorts adherence to balance, warns against arrogance, and illustrates with the analogy of a drawn bow—
to show that humility overcomes pride, and this is its intent.

Life begins in gentleness; death arrives in rigidity.
**Exegesis:**
In life, harmonious *qi* flows, softening the body’s hundred bones.
In death, harmonious *qi* disperses, stiffening the limbs.
This teaches that gentleness and rigidity are the markers of life and death.

**Exegesis:**
Humans inherit the primal *qi*, by which the hundred bones remain supple, and the hundred spirits guard the hundred passes, while the six *qi* circulate through the six organs.
What is precious is nurturing the spirit and preserving *qi*, embodying the Dao and embracing gentleness.
To inscribe one’s vitality in the Southern Palace and erase death’s name from the Northern Bureau—
to prolong life and extend vision—lies here.
But if the spirit and *qi* scatter, harmony fades, and one becomes like grass and trees, surrendering to decay.
To lose this ultimate gentleness is a grievous error.

All things—grass and trees—begin soft and fragile, yet end brittle and withered.
**Exegesis:**
This offers an analogy.
When *qi* gathers, they live, their branches spreading in tender grace.
When *qi* fades, they die, their trunks hardening into decay.
The previous chapter spoke of the enlightened; this illustrates the insensate.
The insensate thrive or perish by *qi*’s gathering or dispersal,
while the enlightened live or die by adherence to the Dao.

**Exegesis:**
All things share the same source in the Dao.
The Dao moves *qi*; *qi* achieves harmony.
Though sentient and insensate differ in form, life and death depend equally on receiving it—
when the Dao abides, life persists; when it departs, death follows.
Thus, winter grass, sheltered, may endure;
a frail lifespan, cultivated, may lengthen.
What is needed is diligent refinement of elixirs—
not surrender to the silent depths.
To defy the Dao through arrogance is a warning.
Thus, the rigid belong to death’s company,
while the gentle belong to life’s.

**Annotation:**
The gentleness of life preserves harmonious *qi*;
the rigidity of death scatters it.
To demonstrate that clinging to gentleness preserves life and strength,
while arrogance destroys both body and nature.

**Exegesis:**
This concludes the chapter’s intent.
Grass and trees are gentle when alive, rigid when dead.
Those who act with rigidity invite death;
those who act with gentleness invite life.

**Exegesis:**
The Sage, mindful of arrogance, issues stern warnings.
Using grass and trees as analogies, He establishes the principle for human conduct:
Arrogance leads to death’s path—let it be abandoned.
Gentleness is the key to life—let it be upheld with diligence, lest one court ruin.

Arrogance in war leads to defeat.
**Annotation:**
The compassionate prevail; thus, those who rely on strength must fall.
**Exegesis:**
When raising armies to punish wrongs, or waging war,
one must first issue three orders and five decrees,
and train in the six arts of war and metalcraft.
Having arranged ranks and formations, one still relies on terrain and unity—
acting only when necessary, not indulging in slaughter.
Symmetry’s million troops, or Qin’s Mu’s defeat at the Heng Mountains,
where cavalry could not retreat and chariots could not turn—
this was strength provoking the enemy, and defeat was inevitable.

Trees grow rigid at the root, yet their branches, gentle, rise above.
**Exegesis:**
The root, strong, remains below;
the branches, weak, grow upward.
This teaches that the gentle must prevail over the rigid.

**Exegesis:**
The root’s strength is natural.
If branches exceed the root, it is unnatural.
The proverb warns: *"A tail too large cannot wag the dog"*—a nation’s caution.
The Zhao overthrew Jin; the Tian usurped Qi.
Zi’s suspicions doomed Yan; Tai Sheng’s arrogance failed at Zheng.
Is this not branches overpowering roots, subjects overpowering rulers—
a violation of proper order?

*"Gathering hands"* is called *"embracing"* (拱).
In ancient Yin, the mulberry of Sangu grew to embrace in seven days.
When Qin’s Duke was enraged at Zhao Shu, the grave’s cypress had already embraced.
All speak of trees grown large enough to embrace.

The strong must be beneath; the gentle, above.
**Exegesis:**
This concludes the analogy of the tree’s strong root beneath and gentle branches above,
to show that the arrogant must always submit to the gentle.

**Exegesis:**
Humans, through humility, can master the fierce;
branches, though frail, rise above the mighty trunk.
One must cultivate reverence for modesty and guard against rigidity.
The Qin, swallowing seven states, perished by the dagger’s wine;
Zhou, leading a thousand thieves, lost his life.
Only then, with a still mind and serene nature,
dwelling in non-contention, resting in self-possession,
may one ride the winds and clouds, achieving transcendence.

**Chapter Seventy-Seven: The Dao of Heaven**
**Exegesis:**
The previous chapter showed that artificial governance breeds desire,
thus losing the gentle harmony of *qi*.
This chapter reveals that arrogance invites ruin,
and thus offers the Dao of Heaven as an analogy.
The opening line establishes Heaven’s warning.

**Chapter Seventy-Seven: The Dao of Heaven (Continued)**

The next five lines offer analogies to illuminate Heaven’s ways.
Eight lines follow, summarizing the foregoing principles.
Thus, the sage’s virtue is invoked below to conclude the exhortation.

**Exegesis:**
The analogy of the bow is drawn—
where gentleness prevails and strength is tempered,
not the reckless drawing of a bow.
To suppress the high and elevate the low
is to invite ruin through excess—
to diminish the full and augment the deficient,
ultimately grounding oneself in cautious stillness,
not in the arrogance of strength.

The principle of subduing the firm is further elucidated,
making the warning yet clearer.

**Heaven’s Dao—is it not like drawing a bow?**
**Annotation:**
Heaven’s Dao is profound and distant—
an analogy alone cannot fully illuminate it.
Thus, the bow is invoked to reveal its function.

**Exegesis:**
Here, two analogies are employed in parallel.
Heaven’s Dao is profound and distant—
an analogy alone cannot fully illuminate it,
so the bow is cited to manifest Heaven’s virtue.
The method of drawing a bow is as follows:

**Exegesis:**
The vast sky above, broadly covering all—
its boundless *qi* is subtly revealed,
illustrating the rule of high and low.
For human affairs stray from truth,
seeking to fill deficiencies through action,
while Heaven’s Dao is upright—
diminishing excess to achieve balance.
Thus, it suppresses the high and elevates the low,
like restraining the strong and soothing the weak,
neither presuming nor relying,
concealing wisdom and hiding virtue—
both analogies are marked here.
This is its essence.

Heaven’s Dao is distant, while human affairs are near—
words spoken by Zi Chan when praying to the kitchen god to avert fire.
Yet though Heaven’s Dao is distant, its omens are observable,
a warning for humanity.
By invoking Heaven’s Dao as an analogy,
it is hoped that the world will revere the lofty and profound,
investigate Heaven’s intent,
and take it as a precept—
a principle that must be followed.

To suppress the high and elevate the low,
to diminish excess and supplement deficiency—
**Annotation:**
Thus, the bow is drawn to ensure precision.
This mirrors Heaven’s Dao of diminishing the full and augmenting the deficient,
urging rulers to emulate Heaven’s pattern.
Hence, the principle of elevating the low and suppressing the high is demonstrated.

**Exegesis:**
The bow’s function requires proper materials and form,
relaxation and tension, adjustment and refinement.
To suppress the high and elevate the low—
this is the standard for positioning the arrow.
To diminish excess and supplement deficiency—
this governs the distance of the shot.
Thus, precision is achieved.

Heaven’s Dao operates likewise.
The sun and moon, cold and heat, come and go—
their coming diminishes excess,
their going supplements deficiency,
thus completing the year’s work.
A ruler must follow Heaven’s Dao:
suppressing strength, aiding weakness,
diminishing advantage, assisting disadvantage—
hence, the principle of diminishing the full and augmenting the deficient,
so that governance may be equitable and just.

**Exegesis:**
Heaven’s Dao is subtle yet manifest—
yin and yang move in harmony,
clarity and turbidity are distinctly partitioned,
cold and heat, darkness and light—
no deviation in the shadow’s measure.
The celestial patterns and constellations align without error,
whether vast as the cosmos or minute as the grain’s accumulation.
Truly, truly—
it never falters, never errs.
Its analogy lies in Heaven’s aversion to fullness,
the bow’s suppression of the high,
humanity’s preference for modesty—
like the bow’s elevation of the low.
It seeks to curb the lofty and arrogant,
to uphold humility.

The crafting of a bow requires discerning wood’s nature,
selecting straight grain, balancing light and weight,
avoiding any crookedness.
Then, with arrows of true metal and sinew,
stringed with divine glue,
when drawn to the mark, it pierces the target—
no shot is wasted.
This is the principle of elevating the low and suppressing the high.

Heaven’s Dao and the ruler’s virtue correspond above and below,
thus one must emulate Heaven’s function as the bow’s method.
A ruler’s role is to revive stagnation, illuminate obscurity,
revive the extinct and restore the abandoned—
this is elevating the low;
to curb strength, restrain violence,
break sharpness, and crush ferocity—
this is suppressing the high.
Thus, rewards and punishments are just,
titles and offices are properly assigned,
the lower ranks harbor no partisan grievances,
and the upper realm achieves the transformation of Great Peace.

**The Rites of Zhou: The Bowmaker**
Gathers wood, horn, sinew, glue, silk, and lacquer at their proper times.
When the six materials are assembled, the skilled artisan blends them.
The wood should be reddish-black with a resonant tone—
for long-range shots, tension is key;
for deep penetration, straightness is essential.
Horn should be greenish-white with a full tip—
if harvested in autumn, it is thick;
if in spring, it is thin.
The horn of a young ox is straight and glossy,
that of an old ox is curved and dull.
When the three colors are present, the bow is deemed excellent,
then dried in winter, sinews processed in summer,
horn softened in spring, silk and glue applied in autumn,
and the bow’s form set in cold—
only then does it bend without slipping.
With fine materials and skilled craftsmanship,
timed perfectly, this is called *san jun* (three harmonies).
Three harmonies make *jiu he* (nine harmonies).
The upper bow measures six feet six inches,
the middle six feet three inches,
the lower six feet.
Thus, when drawn, it has the tension of forward and backward motion,
and when released, it carries the names of safety and danger.
Hence, there are bows that are dangerous when drawn but safe when shot,
and bows that are safe when drawn but dangerous when shot.

Upright wood and swift horn—
these are the finest materials.
A well-harmonized bow and feathered arrow—
these were the treasures of antiquity.

**The Arrow’s Craft:**
The arrow-maker forges arrows—
war arrows and field arrows,
two in front, three behind.
Divide its length into three, removing one part,
divide its length into five, attaching feathers.
Dip it in water to distinguish yin and yang,
bind yin and yang to set their alignment,
bind the alignment to set the feathers,
divide the feathers into three to position the blade.
Bind and shake it to observe the balance of fullness and sharpness,
bend it to test the harmony of strength and flexibility.
For *fu* arrows, divide into three—one in front, two behind.
For *sha* arrows, divide into seven—three in front, four behind.
If the front is weak, it will falter;
if the rear is weak, it will soar;
if the middle is weak, it will curve;
if the middle is too strong, it will rise;
if the feathers are too full, it will lag;
if the blade is too sharp, it will falter.
If the shaft is fresh and supple,
even in a fierce wind, it will not waver.
The bow and arrow’s craft—
selecting materials, awaiting the season,
applying skill with precision—
only then can they strike true.
How much more so for humanity?

The **Deficit and Surplus, Gain and Modesty**—the *Yì* speaks of the **Modesty Hexagram**, saying, *"The Way of Heaven diminishes the full to augment the modest,"* meaning to reduce excess and increase humility, just as the sun declines and the moon wanes. This is the principle of suppressing the high and elevating the low.

Again, it speaks of *"even distribution to all"*—words from the **Modesty Hexagram**, stating that what comes first in abundance also receives its due.

What comes first also receives its due; both abundance and scarcity find their benefit. It is said: *"The abundant use modesty to gather more, the scarce rely on modesty to receive more."* The application of modesty in giving never strays from balance.

The **Way of Heaven** diminishes the surplus to supplement the deficient. But the **Way of Man** does the opposite: it diminishes the deficient to serve the surplus.

**Note:** Heaven’s distribution is even—it pities the many and aids the few. Man, however, reverses this, diminishing the deficient.

**Commentary:** This shows that the Way of Man cannot align with Heaven’s balancing. The note says *"gather the many, aid the few"*—words from the **Modesty Hexagram**.

**Meaning:** Heaven’s Way is to level the surplus; it must diminish the deficient, whereas Man’s Way does the opposite. He extinguishes the deficient to serve the surplus, so that the wealthy feast on delicacies while the poor lack even coarse grains—this is to go against the Way.

*"Gather the many, aid the few"*—from the **Modesty Hexagram’s *Xìang* (Appendant):** *"Earth within mountain—Modesty. The noble one pities the many and aids the few."* *Kǒu* (gather), *guǎ* (few), *yì* (aid). The abundant, through modesty, are further gathered; the scarce, through modesty, are further aided—this is the balanced Way.

Or *kǒu* (gather) may also mean *"take."* To take from the abundant and give to the scarce—this fulfills the meaning of suppressing the high, diminishing the full, and augmenting the modest.

The essentials of governing the realm and harmonizing the people, the rules for cultivating oneself and aligning with the Way—this is its particular virtue.

Who can use their surplus to nourish the world? Only the **Daoist**.

**Note:** Who can use their own surplus to nourish the world’s deficiency? Only the **Daoist** can.

**Commentary:** *Na* (who), meaning *"who."* The **Venerable Master** lamented that the age could not follow Heaven’s Way in descending to aid others, thus expanding virtue. Hence, he cited Heaven’s Way to exhort: *"Who can follow Heaven’s Way, diminishing their surplus to relieve the deficient? Only the Daoist ruler can do so."*

**Meaning:** *Rù* (relieve), meaning *"to rescue."* *Sǔn* (diminish), meaning *"to suppress."* *Jiù* (relieve), meaning *"to provide."* Heaven’s descending aid is from the **Modesty Hexagram’s** appendant words.

What people practice, however, reverses Heaven’s Way: they diminish the deficient to serve the surplus. How much more than harming others does this violate the Way? Yet they plunder without end, and the starving go unpitied.

The **Venerable Master** unfurled sacred words, pitying the helpless, saying: *"Who can extinguish their own surplus to relieve others’ deficiency, conforming to Heaven and nurturing all? Only the Daoist ruler."*

Thus, the **Sage** acts without claiming merit,
**Note:** The Sage follows Heaven, conforms to things, and distributes evenly, yet does not rely on his deeds.

**Commentary:** This cites the Sage to affirm the earlier meaning of the Daoist. *"Shì"* (rely) is akin to *"boast."* The Sage follows Heaven’s even distribution; virtue extends to all, yet he does not see his deeds, hence *"does not rely."*

**Meaning:** The Sage’s boundless wisdom adapts to things, like Heaven and Earth’s spontaneous generation, without speaking of virtue. It is like the gentle warmth of *yánghé*, not boasting of its kindness. Though he does not rely or dwell on deeds, his Way only broadens.

*"Conforming to things and distributing evenly"*—already explained above.

*"The deed accomplished, yet not dwelling"*—
**Note:** To attribute the deed to others, not dwelling on accomplishment, is virtue.

**Commentary:** The Sage knows that if one dwells on deeds, Heaven will diminish them. Thus, though his Way permeates the world and his deeds benefit all, he attributes merit to others and does not claim his achievements.

**Meaning:** Citing the Sage’s virtue, how much more so for the Daoist ruler—all follow the Way to conform to Heaven’s even distribution, benefiting all without relying on deeds, aligning with Heaven without claiming virtue, standing tall with Heaven itself.

Yet he does not wish to be seen as virtuous.
**Note:** The Sage, in not claiming deeds or dwelling on merit, does not wish others to see his virtue.

**Commentary:** This concludes the meaning of *"not relying, not dwelling."* Though the Sage’s inner virtue is abundant, his outer reputation is hidden. Precisely because he does not rely on action or dwell on deeds, he seeks to conceal virtue and obscure name, not wishing others to see his excellence.

This is also the meaning of diminishing the surplus.

**Meaning:** The **Great Sage’s** virtue merges with the Mysterious Function, inwardly illuminating the subtle, outwardly blending with things. For if virtue were manifest, compassion would arise; if compassion were fixed, deeds would remain. He would rather conceal deeds in their completion, obscure virtue in its transformation—this accords with the principle of suppressing the high and diminishing the full, echoing the *Zhèngyán Ruòfǎn* (Proper Speech as Reverse).

**End of Volume Forty-Eight of *The Broad Explication of the Sacred Meaning of the Dao De Jing*.**
**Beginning of Volume Forty-Nine of *The Broad Explication of the Sacred Meaning of the Dao De Jing*.**

**Chapter Seventy-Eight: The Softness and Weakness of the World**

**Commentary:**
The previous chapter demonstrated that rigidity and forcefulness inevitably invite harm, illustrating the metaphor of the Dao/Way. This chapter reveals that softness and weakness bring benefit, thus praising the **virtue/power** of Water. The first five sentences establish Water’s superior efficacy. The next four lament those who cannot embody it. Five more sentences clarify and expand upon the preceding meaning, while the final sentence connects back to the earlier text.

○ **Meaning:**
The prior chapter expounded the Sage’s practice of not relying or dwelling in deeds. Here, it extols the **virtue/power** of Water—its ability to overcome hardness and strength. To uphold softness and weakness is to cultivate humility and radiance; to cling to rigidity and forcefulness is to invite suppression and defeat. Hence, the sovereign practices **containing impurity** as the highest virtue, and establishes a name through **non-prosperity** as the foremost principle. This aligns perfectly with the Sage’s **virtue/power**, though to common ears it may seem as if the correct is reversed. Thus, through the principle of **grasping the契 (harmony)**, the method of **doing good** is further illuminated.

Nowhere in the world is softness and weakness more evident than in Water, yet nothing can surpass its ability to overcome firmness and strength.

**Commentary:**
Water’s nature is to yield and not contend, its movement and stillness adapting to circumstances, its form and flow conforming to vessels. Therefore, when citing the world’s softness and weakness, none surpasses Water. Yet in overcoming firmness and strength, nothing can defeat it—Water, though soft, can erode stone; stone, though firm, cannot harm Water. If firmness attacks firmness, both are damaged; but when Water attacks stone, the stone is diminished while Water remains whole. Thus, it is known that in overcoming firmness and subduing strength, there is nothing better than Water—hence the saying, *"nothing can surpass it."*

**Meaning:**
Water’s application is such: its essence is supremely soft, its nature inclined to descend. All rivers converge and flow into the sea, while a hundred valleys pay homage to their source. It spreads like mist to nourish the void, and ascends in clarity to reach the celestial streams. In its vastness, it fills the ancient seas without overflowing; in its subtlety, it sustains even the finest hairs with moisture. Thus, the **Laozi** aligns it with the Dao/Way.

It does not yield to three **abilities** and possesses seven **virtues/powers**, encompassing the transformations of the cosmos, penetrating all forms and omens, enduring filth and impurity, adapting to square or round. This is its ultimate softness—nothing can harm it. Yet when it floods the ten continents, drifts across the eight extremes, submerges the sun and moon, and contains the heavens and earth, it reshapes valleys and upholds the vastness of the sky, while the **peng** bird relies on it for metamorphosis. It can topple mountains and erode stone—nothing it cannot do. This is its ultimate strength—nothing can restrain it.

Thus, though strength and softness mutually restrain, the rigid must be diminished. This arises from the **six desires** ensnaring nature and the **three activities** binding the body, their entanglements growing daily, their hardness difficult to dissolve. Yet with the Dao’s ultimate softness and **True’s** ultimate stillness, they may be melted and dispersed. Over time, with steady practice, one attains clarity and purity—**emptiness generates whiteness**. This is the saying: *"Ultimate softness overcomes firmness—nothing can surpass it."* And there is no alternative to it.

**Annotation:**
When firmness attacks firmness, both are damaged. But when softness subdues strength, the strength is diminished while the softness remains intact. Thus, in overcoming firmness, nothing is better than Water.

**Commentary:**
Though Water is supremely soft, in overcoming firm and strong things, nothing can replace it. Is this not because it possesses the **virtue/power** of non-contention, yet lacks the mentality of clinging to victory? In governing the realm and cultivating the self, one should emulate this principle.

**Meaning:**
To not contend and remain humble, yet overcome firmness and strength—among all things, nothing matches Water. The **qi** of harmony and stillness, the mind of tranquility and serenity, can dispel cravings and desires. In applying the Dao to the self, it repels dust and removes defilement; in governing the realm, it absorbs impurity and cleanses blemish, allowing all things to return to **Ren** (benevolence) and the **six desires** to be extinguished. Thus, softness overcomes hardness, weakness overcomes strength—a truth known by all yet practiced by none.

**Annotation:**
The Dao/Way of softness and weakness surpasses that of rigidity and strength. Though all know this truth, none can embody it.

**Commentary:**
The Dao/Way of softness and weakness surpasses that of rigidity and strength—a principle all acknowledge. Yet, deluded by self-praise and valuing their own superiority, none can enact what they know. Hence the saying, *"none can practice it."*

**Meaning:**
Though all recognize that softness and weakness overcome rigidity and strength, who among them can truly embody softness, cultivate nature, apply the Dao to refine the heart, and temper their hardness with **habitual emptiness and stillness**? If one can embody and cultivate it, how distant is the Dao/Way?

Thus, the Sage says: *"To bear the impurity of the state is called the sovereign of the soil and grain. To bear the state’s misfortune is called the King of the World."*

**Annotation:**
To take upon oneself the faults of all under heaven—that is to bear the impurity and filth of the state. To claim titles like *"lonely, few, and without prosperity"* (孤、寡、不谷)—that is to bear the state’s misfortune. With such **virtue/power**, the soil and grain will be reverently offered, and thus all under heaven will follow.

**Commentary:**
The Sage’s words confirm the preceding principle. These are the actions of one who can practice the Dao/Way of overcoming hardness with softness. *"Impurity"* refers to defilement and dishonor. If a ruler can endure and accept impurity and dishonor, bearing the faults of all under heaven upon themselves, then the people will revere their virtue and remain united, and the soil and grain will be offered in reverence. Hence, it is said: *"This is called the sovereign of the soil and grain."*

To bear the state’s misfortune is called the King of the World. *"Fortune"* means prosperity or goodness. If a ruler practices humility and softness, bearing the state’s misdeeds and claiming titles of insignificance—*"lonely, few, and without prosperity"*—then the four seas will return to **Ren** (benevolence), and it is said: *"This is the King of the World."*

**Meaning:**
Only Water’s **virtue/power** aligns with the Dao/Way above and with kingship below. The Dao/Way governs through transformation and nurturing without partiality; kingship rules through **virtue/power** and governance with benevolence. A ruler possessing **virtue/power** and embodying the Dao/Way attains supreme eminence, blaming themselves for faults, taking responsibility for errors—this is to bear the state’s impurity and misfortune. Thus, the four directions turn toward transformation, the six extremes settle in harmony, and they can perpetually uphold the soil and grain as a king.

The **soil and grain** (社稷) are the left and right foundations of an emperor’s state: the ancestral temple on the left, the altar of earth and grain on the right. The ancestral temple is the position of honoring ancestors and aligning with heaven.

The **soil and grain** (社稷) are the reverence for cultivation and harvest, ensuring abundant offerings and sustenance as the foundation of the people’s grain and food. It is said that "food is the people’s paramount concern," hence a state must first establish its soil and grain, making the ruler the sovereign of the soil and grain.

To bear the faults of all under heaven, the *Shū Jing* [□*Tang’s Edict*] states:
*"All under heaven have faults, lying with me alone.
If I alone have faults, it is not to burden you, all under heaven."*

The terms **"Lonely One" (孤), "Childless One" (寡), and "Unripe Grain" (不谷)** have already been explained in Chapter Thirty-Nine of this text. This is **"upright speech as if inverted."**

**Annotation:** To bear the state’s impurity is to be sovereign of the soil and grain; to bear the state’s misfortune is to be king of all under heaven. This must be upright speech, though it seems inverted to common custom. Hence, it is said, *"upright speech as if inverted."*

**Commentary:** This sentence concludes the preceding passage. To bear the state’s filth and turbidity is to become sovereign of the soil and grain; to bear the state’s misfortune is to become king of all under heaven. Their words contradict common custom, so the Old Master [Laozi] elaborately clarifies: *"This must be true upright speech—when practiced, it is trustworthy, but to common ears, it initially seems inverted."*

**Meaning:** Though it seems inverted to custom, when practiced, it aligns with the Dao/Way. Thus, what the common ear hears is *"upright speech as if inverted."*

The *Lingbao Jing* states:
*"Those who cultivate the Dao abandon wealth and pleasure, forsake honor and splendor, and dwell in secluded mountains, enduring hardships. Yet when their practice is complete and the Dao realized, they ride on feathered chariots and cloud-cars, living long and enduring—transforming suffering into joy."*

The emperor, bearing the names **"Lonely One," "Childless One," and "Unripe Grain," assumes guilt and blames himself to transform the customs. This is to bear the state’s calamities and evils, yet the people willingly follow, thus enabling them to long endure as sovereigns of the soil and grain. This is *"upright speech as if inverted."* Such is the meaning.

[In harmony with the chapter *"Conciliating Great Grievances"* (和大怨), Chapter Seventy-Nine.]

The *Lingbao Jing* commentary states:

*"The previous chapter extolled the virtue/power of yielding and weakness to receive benefit, hence praising the Dao of Water. This chapter reveals that even just laws and decrees give rise to flaws, inevitably leaving lingering grievances. Initially, it is stated that establishing teachings and conciliating grievances is insufficient to be considered true goodness. Next, it explains that those of great virtue/power who uphold the *Left Contract* (心, *xīn*—the heart/mind) will not generate grievances. Finally, it clarifies that the Heavenly Dao has no favorites, bestowing only upon the virtuous.*

*This is to say: The previous chapter spoke of the Sage embodying the boundless and mysterious, upholding the highest virtue/power to serve the soil and grain, and govern in harmony with Heaven. This chapter, however, speaks of holding the *Left Contract* (心, *xīn*—the heart/mind) and riding with the times, making conciliation of grievances a virtue. It thus reveals that the Heavenly Dao favors only the virtuous, demonstrating its lack of partiality.*

*As for abandoning chariots and boats yet not riding them, discarding armor and weapons yet not using them—this is the profound essence of the *Left Contract* (心, *xīn*—the heart/mind) and the Great Dao. Such is its meaning.*

*Conciliating great grievances must inevitably leave lingering grievances.*
*Commentary: The greatest grievance opposing the body is desire. The term "conciliate" means to harmonize. This chapter states that a ruler wishes to use words and teachings to harmonize the people, eliminating desire, hence the phrase "conciliating great grievances."*

*Commentary: At first, humanity was born with pure and tranquil body and mind. Now, however, they are immersed in the dusty world, losing the Dao and falling into corruption—all due to desire. Thus, it is known that the greatest grievance opposing the body is indeed desire.*

*The term "conciliate" means to harmonize. This chapter states that the people, already ensnared by desire and thus giving rise to hypocrisy, cannot be transformed by the ruler’s non-action. Instead, the ruler must establish teachings and laws, restrain their deceitfulness, and harmonize them, hence the phrase "conciliating great grievances."* *Lingering grievances must arise, for establishing teachings and laws cannot be without progression, and their flaws will still generate grievances. Hence, it is said that there must be lingering grievances.*

*This is to say: When speaking of the body, desire is the grievance. The *Record of Rites* (《礼记》) states: "Humanity is born tranquil—this is Heaven’s nature. Stirred by things, it moves—this is the nature of desire. When things reach the mind, knowledge and preference take shape. If preference lacks restraint within, and wisdom is enticed without, unable to return to its original state, Heavenly principle is extinguished. The influence of things upon humanity is boundless, hence it cannot be restrained. Moreover, from the very beginning of life, desire already arises; accumulated habits grow deep, and are difficult to eradicate. If one perseveres in stillness and simplicity, one may still fear the encroachment of trials. Or if one blends with the world and follows the flow, one has not yet reached the state of serene contentment, nor can one fully dispel desire—this is lingering grievance."*

*When speaking of the state, the grievance is the extinction of lineages and the abandonment of the dying. This is called the utmost fairness. Preserving the fallen and aiding the perishing is also a great benevolence. Yet when Wu Geng (武庚) incited calamity and nearly toppled the Zhou lineage, this was lingering grievance. How can this be considered true goodness?*
*Commentary: Since lingering grievances exist, how can it be considered true goodness?*

*Commentary: Establishing teachings and laws will inevitably produce flaws, and lingering grievances will arise. Thus, it is known that goodness lies in the Dao of the common world, seeking to restore its original state. If one can transform downward to attain purity and tranquility, non-action and non-doing, and the people exhibit sincere and simple virtues, free from lingering grievances, then this may be considered true goodness.*

*This is to say: When establishing teachings to guide people and eliminate accumulated habits, how can this be achieved? Only by shaping them with non-action, guiding them with emptiness and stillness, imbibing them with the pure and harmonious qi, blending their boundless and indistinct minds with the Dao, and returning them to the singular essence—thus can lingering grievances be dispelled, and the profound harmony of the *Double Mystery* (重玄, *Chóng Xuàn*) be fully realized.*

*The Dao of the common world seeks to restore its original state, as *Zhuangzi* states in *"Cultivating Virtue"* (《缮性篇》): "The common world is the gateway to benevolence and righteousness; the original state is the root of non-being. Now that people have already learned benevolence and righteousness, their minds are already disturbed, and if they seek to eliminate desire, they cannot restore the clarity of their inner illumination. Hence, the Sage holds the *Left Contract* (心, *xīn*—the heart/mind) and does not blame the people."*

*Commentary: The *Left Contract* (心, *xīn*—the heart/mind) is the yang treasury, harmonizing with the external world, hence it is called the *Left Contract*. The Sage establishes teachings that inevitably produce traces, and traces inevitably lead to lingering grievances. Thus, the Sage holds this mind, making it pure and tranquil, and transforms the people from below. With no desire, there is no need for punishment or blame, and non-action is naturally upheld.*

*This is to say: The Sage uses teachings to guide people, yet cannot fully purify their desires. Holding the mind in emptiness, one can harmonize with the pure and mysterious. When the mind is harmonized, non-action arises, and non-action transforms the people. There is no need for laws, blending with true cultivation, and thus no lingering grievances. The method of cultivating the mind lies in neither clinging nor forgetting, but in perfect clarity and singularity.*

*Within the heart/mind’s teachings, only the *Sutra of Steady Observation* (《定观经》) captures its essence.*
*The Sutra states: "To cultivate the Dao, one must first be able to abandon worldly affairs. When all external matters are severed and none arise in the mind, one can then sit quietly and observe the mind’s movements. If one perceives even a single thought arising, one must immediately eliminate it. As thoughts arise, eliminate them as they arise, striving for complete tranquility. Eliminate only the active mind, not the observing mind. Cultivate this thus, striving for its lasting endurance. Over time, with practice, the mind will reach five stages: First, the mind is mostly active, with little stillness; second, activity and stillness are equal; third, the mind is mostly tranquil, with little activity; fourth, the mind is tranquil when untouched by affairs, yet moves when affairs arise; fifth, the mind merges with the Dao, and even when touched, it does not move. When the mind reaches this state, one begins to attain lasting ease, with all guilt and defilement eradicated, and no further suffering. These five stages are the practices within cultivation. The seven signs are the fruits of cultivation.*

*The seven signs are: First, the mind attains steadiness and perceives no defilements; all movements follow the natural course, and the countenance is serene and pleasant. Second, all previous illnesses vanish, and the body and mind feel light and agile. Third, the Heavenly deficiencies are filled, and one’s lifespan and vitality are restored."*

Living for thousands of years, one is called an *xian* (immortal), the fourth sign.
Refining the form into *qi*, one is called a *zhenren* (True Person), the fifth sign.
Refining *qi* into spirit, one is called a *shenren* (Spirit Person), the sixth sign.
Refining spirit to merge with the Dao, one is called a *shengren* (Sage), the seventh sign.

The Sage establishes teachings for the sake of all beings, for their endless cycle of birth and death, their endless bondage in *saṃsāra*, their wandering in evil realms, and their eternal loss of true and constant nature. Thus, the Sage extinguishes others’ minds with their own mind.

The superior adept, if they follow the Sage’s mind, abides and departs with effortless spontaneity, neither craving sensory pleasures nor clinging to existence or emptiness. Able to extinguish the restless mind, they attain true understanding of the Dao. Once attaining the Dao, they forget the discriminating mind—both movement and stillness forgotten—thus attaining true longevity and ascending the Mysterious Way.

Though the *xian*’s fruit is attained, they remain bound by *qi* and form, subject to fate and lifespan. From the first celestial rank, their lifespan is nine hundred million years; with each advancement to a higher rank, their lifespan doubles, totaling twenty-seven fold until the formless realm, the highest realm of *kuṣala* bliss, where their lifespan reaches one thousand two hundred seventy-nine thousand seven hundred seventy-five thousand five hundred twenty million years. This is why they have a fixed lifespan.

Within the realm of *yin-yang* duality and the three realms of *saṃsāra*, such beings possess form, *qi*, and spirit—all three complete. Though their transformations are unfathomable, they may vanish in an instant or endure eternally, appearing and disappearing freely, their spiritual powers unimpeded. Only when refining form into *qi* do they transcend the three realms.

Yet even then, they remain bound by lifespan. Only when refining *qi* into spirit do they become a *zhenren*, and when refining spirit into Dao do they become a *shengren*. The *zhenren* and *shengren* forever transcend fate and change, measuring eons as fleeting moments, countless heavens as the span of a hand. The ultimate fruit of the Dao arises from refining the mind.

Thus, the *Xisheng Jing* says: *What gives life is spirit; what brings death is mind.* Because the mind distinguishes self and other, the form experiences birth and death. The mindless may ascend the Dao.

The *Lingbao Jing* states: *The Dao is the school of the mindless*—thus it is.

Hence, those with *virtue* govern through harmony, while those without *virtue* govern through law. *(Note: 司, govern; 彻, penetrate.)*
The virtuous ruler governs through attunement with the mind; thus, people transform naturally. The ruler without *virtue*, unable to empty the mind and forget the self, seeks only to impose laws to control others. Laws breed corruption—thus, they lack *virtue*.

The meaning is this: Holding attunement is easy to govern; establishing laws is difficult to penetrate. The ruler who holds attunement is virtuous and may reach the Dao. The ruler who relies on laws is without *virtue* and cannot fathom the Mysterious.

This is the Sage-ruler’s insight.

Now, I say that the virtuous ruler is the sovereign of later antiquity, while the ruler without *virtue* is the sovereign of primordial antiquity. The virtuous ruler, though their *virtue* is named, attunes mind to principle and things—though things transform for the good, they cannot attain the Dao. The primordial sovereign’s *virtue* is vast and nameless, transforming the people in the Dao. Only when their governance is effortless and spontaneous can they perceive the One, thoughtless and actionless, attuning to the Great Dao. Thus, they attain steadfast insight, forget the mind’s essential nature, and ascend from *zhen* to *sheng*.

The Way of Heaven favors none; it constantly aids the virtuous. *(Note: Attunement brings purity; laws bring decay.)*
The Imperial Heaven favors none—only *virtue* sustains it. Thus, the ruler must always cultivate pure transformation, abandoning action, never imposing laws to create strife.

*(Explanation: Though Heaven’s blessings are impartially bestowed upon the virtuous, those who govern through attunement receive Heaven’s favor and prosperity without hindrance. Those who govern through laws invite Heaven’s calamities, and their sins cannot be escaped. Is this not proof that Heaven favors none, only *virtue* sustains it?)*

The meaning is this: The Way of attunement arises from within and clarifies, thus pure and easy to govern. The principle of laws originates externally and controls, thus decaying and difficult to penetrate. Laws are the source of corruption, ever distant from goodness. Attunement harmonizes with the Dao’s essence—this is the root of virtue.

Heaven’s blessings and calamities make this clear. As for calamities, the *Shangshu* [*I E* instruction] says: *The Sage’s wise counsels are vast and bright, their virtuous words clearly displayed. Only does Heaven not remain constant—bestowing a hundred blessings upon the virtuous, a hundred calamities upon the wicked.* Thus, the Imperial Heaven favors none; only *virtue* sustains it.

The *Shangshu* [*Cai Zhong* section] states: *Heaven, regarding the people, has no near or far—only the virtuous does it aid and protect. The people’s hearts have no constant lord—only those who love them do they follow. As it is said: ‘Nurture me, and I will be loyal; oppress me, and I will seek vengeance.’*

*(End of Volume 49 and 50 of the Broad Explication of the Dao-De Jing’s Sacred Meaning.)*

**Chapter Eighty: The Small State, Few People**
*(Attributed to Master Guangcheng of the Tang by Du Guangting)*

**Exegesis:**

The previous chapter reveals that laws and decrees breed corruption, inevitably leaving behind lingering resentment. This chapter demonstrates that simplicity and purity embody the natural order, requiring no self-aggrandizing ambition.

First, it advocates the Dao of *wuwei* to inspire the people.
Next, it shows that when people follow the ruler’s virtue, harmony follows.
Finally, it illustrates that when households are well-provisioned and people’s needs are met, there is nothing further to desire.

**Meaning:**
When rulers establish laws through contracts, victory and defeat differ.
This is to make death precious and refine the people through simplicity, returning to the roots of knotted cords—thus, no need for military conquest. Sweet food and fine clothing are enjoyed within their proper bounds; people dwell contentedly in their customs, never losing their harmony.

Though neighbors hear one another’s roosters and dogs, they do not exchange visits as a ritual. Trustworthy messengers are sent, yet even this is forgotten. Without labor or strife, they penetrate the Dao of the Sage.

In a small state with few people, even if there are capable officials ranked as *shi* (ten), *wu* (five), or *bo* (elders), they are not employed.
**Note:** *Shi* means *wu* (five); *bo* means elder.
This shows that a virtuous ruler, harmonious and pure, requires no demands from his *wu*, *shi*, or elders. Even if someone is qualified to serve as a *wu*, *shi*, or elder, they are not used.

**Exegesis:**
*Guǎ* means few. *Shi* means *wu* (five). *Bo* means elder. *Qi* means talent and ability.
This discusses the age of pure antiquity.
A small state means not seeking expansion. Few people mean not seeking increase. Not seeking expansion removes greed and competition; not seeking increase simplifies governance. When simplicity prevails, the pure and unadorned flourish.

Even if capable individuals emerge to lead the *wu* or *shi*, they are not employed.
**Meaning:**
A small state is easy to govern; few people are easy to pacify.
Even if officials are appointed, there are no ministers or executives. Ruler and subjects follow their proper roles, with no external desires for gain. The people retain their purity, all reaching the path of simplicity.

If a great state follows this method, the world will naturally be governed by *wuwei*.

People value life and do not migrate far.
**Note:** With few private desires and simple needs, life is not lightly risked. Revering the roots and seeking nothing, they do not move far.
**Exegesis:**
*Xǐ* means migration. The people, refined by virtue and unburdened by harsh governance, cherish life and thus do not migrate.
**Meaning:**
In a realm where governance is effortless and the people are at peace, embracing purity and simplicity, who would seek to abandon their homes? It is said: *"Content in their dwellings, delighted in their customs, people live out their years without visiting one another."* This is the Dao at its zenith.

Though there are boats and carriages, they are not used.
**Exegesis:**
Boats and carriages exist to traverse water and land, facilitating exchange. But with no need for travel, they are abandoned and unused.
As Zhuangzi says: *"In the age of perfect virtue, mountains lack paths and marshes lack bridges."*

**Meaning:**
Hewing wood for boats to cross water, carving wheels for carriages to traverse land—these are for distant journeys. In a small state with limited land, there is no need for such exertion. People dwell naturally, with no wandering. Thus, there is no need for boats or carriages.

*Shuō* means path; *suì* means tunnel.
As in *Zhuangzi*’s *"Horsefoot"* chapter: *"In the age of perfect virtue, their steps are unhurried, their gaze serene. Mountains lack paths and tunnels; marshes lack bridges."* All creatures gather in their native lands, birds and beasts form flocks, grasses and trees grow freely. Thus, birds and beasts can be tethered and observed in their nests—how could one distinguish between gentlemen and commoners? This is the age of unadorned simplicity.

Though there are arms and armor, they are not displayed.
**Exegesis:**
Arms and armor are used to subdue the unyielding and repel enemies. With virtue practiced above and no discord below, the need for warfare vanishes, and arms are stored away, unused.
**Meaning:**
When the ruler governs by *wuwei* and subjects remain pure, there is no internal rebellion or external aggression. Though arms exist, what purpose do they serve?

Travelers move in silent accord, their hearts aligned with the true Dao, their desires unclouded, their eyes untempted by excess. Though there are laws and prohibitions, they are not sought out.
This is the innate understanding of the Sage, not achieved through effort. It is as if the people, refined by virtue, require no martial preparedness.

People return to using knotted cords.
**Note:** Boats and carriages exist for migration; arms exist for conquest. Without such desires, there is no need for them. Reverting to purity, they return to the Three Sovereigns, using knotted cords once more.
**Exegesis:**
In antiquity, before writing, events were recorded by knotting cords. Thus, the *"Systematic Pivot"* says: *"In the upper antiquity, knotted cords were used to govern; later, the Sage replaced them with writing."* Now, to restore the age of knotted cords, people must abandon emotions and desires, returning to purity.
**Meaning:**
When virtue governs and pure people are nurtured, there is no need for water or land travel, no need for arms. Even knotted cords would be deemed cumbersome. The text of the *"Systematic Pivot"* is fully explained here.

In the upper antiquity, before writing, knotted cords were first used. Once writing arose, knotted cords faded. Now, in an age of artificial governance and excessive affairs, if people embrace the Dao’s harmony and return to simplicity, they revert to knotted cords.

They find their food sweet,
**Note:** Not craving flavors, they find sustenance sweet.

「They find their clothing beautiful,
**Note:** Not indulging in embroidered adornments, thus all their garments are beautiful.

**Explanation:** The sweetness of food lies in moderation; moderation makes all food sweet.
The beauty of clothing lies in fittingness; fittingness makes all clothing beautiful.
If not moderate and fitting, even jade food and silk garments would not suffice to be called sweet or beautiful.

**Meaning:** Their bodies are filled with moderation, their mouths satisfied with sustenance, yet they do not seek luxuries.

In the *Book of Documents*, even the Son of Heaven and the feudal lords had jade food.
Now, silk is made of five vibrant colors, crafted by meticulous female artisans—its use would be excessive, its production burdensome for the people.
Moreover, clothing serves to cover the body, to ward off cold and heat;
Food fills the mouth, to relieve hunger and want.
When warmth and satiety are achieved, cold and privation do not intrude,
Enough to secure their bodies and bring joy to their nature—
Why seek finery and delicacies?

They find their dwellings peaceful,
**Note:** Not building extravagant structures, thus their dwellings are peaceful.
And their customs delightful.
**Note:** Not corrupting simplicity and purity, thus their customs are joyful.

**Explanation:** Without desires, their dwellings are naturally peaceful and their customs pure, hence delightful.
If they pursue desires without restraint, they will not find peace in their dwellings,
And harsh governance will only add to their troubles—
How then could they still delight in their customs?

**Meaning:** Universally embracing harmony and purity,
Thus their dwellings are peaceful and their customs delightful.

Neighboring states are in sight,
And the sounds of chickens and dogs are heard.
**Note:** Indicating their proximity.

Yet the people go until old age and death without visiting each other.
**Note:** No excessive seeking.

**Explanation:** States are close, yet chickens and dogs can be heard—
This is merely to show their proximity.
People do not visit each other until old age and death,
Because each is self-sufficient, with no need to seek from others.

**Meaning:** The ruler holds no meetings at the borders,
The people have no desires beyond their own bodies—
Though exposed to winds and mists, why would they cross mountains to travel?
Within their own bodies, they each fulfill their proper measure;
Externally, they reject greed and covetousness.
In their states, they each thrive in their own lives,
And the people know no labor or service.

To delight in the Dao and follow their nature—
This is the Dao’s ultimate attainment.

**Chapter 81: "Trustworthy Speech is Not Beautiful"**
**Explanation:** The two sections together illuminate virtue and power,
Beginning with the declaration of the central theme to open the gate of myriad mysteries,
And ending with their convergence.

To convey the path of intuitive understanding,
It entrusts *trustworthy speech* to clarify the teachings of the Dao,
Discusses *goodness* to caution practitioners in their cultivation,
Records *knowledge* and *comprehension* to guide those lost in confusion or enlightenment,
Expounds *non-accumulation* to teach the forgetting of what is left behind,
Uses *having-many* to expound the boundless nature of the Dao,
And concludes with *non-contentiousness* to elucidate the Sage’s wisdom.

To lead scholars toward refining subtle insights within speech and symbols,
To abandon the Dao once its purpose is fulfilled, like discarding a fishing rod after catching the fish,
To comprehend the teachings and be able to forget them—
Why need one seal the mouth like *Pi Ye*?

Through speech, one understands the meaning of *no speech*,
And naturally attains clarity of heart beneath the pillars.

**Meaning:** This chapter serves as the culmination of the two sections’ beginning and end.
From the Dao that can be spoken and named to the final state of *non-harm* and *non-contentiousness*,
The eighty-one chapters align with Heaven’s law and follow Earth’s pattern.

Here, the principles of *trustworthy speech* and *beauty*,
The contrast between *luxury* and *substance* that can be forgotten,
The terms of *knowledge* and *comprehension* with their *many* layers,
And the distinction between *refined expressions* and *plain truth* that can be discarded—
All merge into the realm of the ultimate Dao,
Where forgetting speech and symbols, one attains *mystery* and *mystery’s fulfillment*,
And delves deep into the pivot of simultaneous forgetting and blending.

The *gate of myriad mysteries* refers to the words of the first chapter of the *Systematic Pivot*.
*Speech and symbols* are as in the *Easy □ System* (易□系), which says:
"To attain the meaning and forget the symbols;
To attain the symbols and forget the speech."

*Fishing rod and snares* are as in the *Easy □ System* (易□系), which says:
"To attain the hare and forget the snares;
To attain the fish and forget the fishing rod."

All are already explained in the text.

If one like *Pi Ye* seals the mouth,
They will only obscure the true essence of the Dao,
And though they sweep the *Spirit Mountain* (灵山) with their mats,
They will remain lost in the correct vision.»

How could this be compared to this text’s clarity and completeness,
Where both essence and application are illuminated?

When it comes to cultivating the self and governing the family,
A hundred gates harmonize, and the six relations thrive in amity;
When establishing the realm and ruling the people,
The entire land is tranquil, and the nine regions are purified.

It is the successor to the ancient masters, the model for a hundred kings.

The *Gzhidu* (柱下) refers to Laozi, who in the time of King Wu of Zhou,
Dwelt at Qi, assisting King Wu as the *Gzhidu* Historian—
That is, today’s *Grand Historian* (御史).

*"True speech is not beautiful."*
**Note:** True speech refers to the sacred teachings.
True and authentic speech does not accord with common tastes,
Thus it is not beautiful.

**Commentary:** True speech is the sacred teaching’s authentic words.
Laozi wished to clarify his own expounded teachings,
To transform and guide all beings—
Truly sincere, yet conflicting with the vulgar.
Thus, the people of his age deemed it unrefined.

**Explanation:** The Great Sage imparted instruction,
Prioritizing the elucidation of the Dao.
Without ornate words to please the people,
Without deceptive rhetoric to deceive the masses.
True principles are straightforward,
Plain yet without embellishment—
Thus, the vulgar eye perceives it as unrefined.

Yet, following principle in thought,
Residing in the scriptures with sincerity,
Not only does it bring harmony to the realm and the people,
But it also achieves longevity and effortless mastery—
Truly, this is sincere authenticity.

*"Beautiful speech is not true."*
**Note:** Beautiful speech refers to the teachings of the age.
Sweet and ornate speech aligns with common tastes,
Thus it is not true.

**Commentary:** Beautiful speech refers to the teachings of the age,
Sweet and ornate words.
Speech filled with superficial elegance,
Always pleasing to the vulgar,
Yet lacking in authenticity—
Unable to transform people,
Thus it is not beautiful.
It is precisely because the teachings of the age are beautiful yet untrue.

**Explanation:** The teachings of the age prioritize rhetorical flourish.
Without profound principles to rely upon,
Without esoteric discourses to adopt,
Only adornment is considered richness,
And verbose complexity as extraordinary skill—
Pleasing to the ear, cherished by common sentiment,
Yet unfit for worldly transformation,
Only suited to gratify fleeting desires.
Thus, it is beautiful yet untrue.

*"The virtuous do not argue."*
**Note:** Virtue lies in action, not in debate.

**Commentary:** The merit of enlightenment lies in practice.
Practice without attachment,
Never clinging to discourse—
Thus, there is no need for argumentation.

**Explanation:** Those who know and act do not labor in speech.
Thus, the scripture says, *"The wise do not speak."*
Elaborate argumentation widens the path while exhausting words,
Empty rhetoric prevails, yet substance is scarce—
Only fit for deceiving the vulgar,
Unable to directly attain the mysterious.
Thus, those who speak truly of the Dao
Reach the point of no speech,
Not relying on argumentation.
The *Western Ascension Scripture* says, *"The Dao lies in diligent practice, not in mere speech."*

*"Those who argue are not virtuous."*
**Note:** Empty, stagnant argumentation—thus, not virtuous.

**Commentary:** Only capable of debating teachings,
Yet never enlightened to practice.
Delusion and stagnation abound—
Thus, it is not virtuous.

**Explanation:** Though one may discourse fluently,
And engage in intricate rhetoric,
In speech, they are indeed abundant—
Yet stagnant words obscure enlightenment,
Clinging to principles blinds one to true practice.
Excessive words confuse people—
Thus, it is not virtuous.
The scripture says, *"The speaker does not know."*

Those who can argue yet cannot act—
The *Western Ascension Scripture* says,
*"Words emerge before the flying dragon,*
*Action follows the lame turtle."*

*"The wise are not erudite."*
**Commentary:** *Wise*—enlightenment.
*Erudite*—extensive knowledge.
Those who embody the Dao in enlightenment
Focus on singularity, not extensive knowledge.
Thus, Zhuangzi says, *"The erudite drown in knowledge."*

**Explanation:** The Dao lies in knowing, not in erudition.
Knowing and acting upon it—
The ultimate Dao is not burdensome,
A single word suffices for enlightenment.
Diligence endures, and endurance strengthens—
Thus, the Dao is attained.
Yet knowing while seeking erudition,
Erudite yet unmindful of practice—
Words precede, yet action lags—
Thus, the Dao is lost.

The erudite who drown in knowledge—
As Zhuangzi says in *"Refining Life"*:
*"In ancient times, simplicity and purity had already dispersed,
And virtue had declined.
In the Tang and Yu eras,
Wisdom was insufficient to govern the world,
Thus, they appended it with culture,
And enriched it with erudition.
Culture extinguished substance,
Erudition drowned the mind—
Only then did the people begin to be confused and disordered,
Unable to return to their nature or restore their original state.
From this, it is clear:
The world loses the Dao,
The Dao loses the world,
The world and the Dao mutually destroy each other.
How then can the Daoist flourish in the world?
How can the world flourish in the Dao?"*
This criticizes abandoning *wuwei* for forced action.
Thus, drums and bells become tools of decadence,
Jade and silk become resources for plunder—
Chaos arises from this.

If a ruler governs the state,
And can abandon artificial refinement,
Suppress extravagance,
Reduce excessive rituals,
Simplify music and ceremonies,
Transforming with genuine simplicity,
Doing nothing yet achieving nothing—
How could they fear the mind being drowned in erudition?

*"The erudite do not know."*
**Note:** *Know*—enlightenment.
*Erudite*—extensive knowledge.

**Commentary:** Extensive knowledge leads to stagnation in teachings,
Stagnation in teachings means exhausting all things in words.
Yet not enlightened—
Thus, it is said they do not know.

**Explanation:** The essence of the Dao lies in
Attaining speech yet forgetting speech,
Knowing the Dao and practicing it.
Once practice is achieved,
Teachings are also forgotten.
Adhering to singularity brings no burden,
*Wuwei* brings no chaos.
Thus, those steeped in verbal teachings
Are distant from the Dao.
How could they attain the mysterious and profound?

*"The Sage does not accumulate."*
**Note:** *Accumulate*—clinging to words, stagnating in teachings, hoarding them.

The Sage enlights to speech yet forgets speech,
Awakens to teachings yet discards them,
Holding nothing—
Thus, it is said the Sage does not accumulate.

**Commentary:** *Accumulate*—stagnation and hoarding.
The Sage penetrates the profound source of principles,
Deeply understands the nature of the law,
Realizes the emptiness of words and teachings,
Comprehends the void of speech and doctrine.
Once the principles are clear,
The words used to explain them are also discarded—
Thus, regarding those teachings, there is no stagnation or hoarding—
Hence, it is said the Sage does not accumulate.

**Explanation:** The Sage practices *wuwei*—
*Wuwei* in action is also discarded;

The Sage forgets the teachings,
And both stagnant and superficial teachings are forgotten.

Enlightened to subtlety and profundity,
Adhering to emptiness and boundlessness—
Thus, no stagnation or hoarding of the common teachings.

Those who cultivate the True Dao must also awaken to this forgetting of words,
And comprehend this profound Way.

The more one gives to others, the more one possesses;
The more one gives to others, the more one has.
**Note:** This illustrates the inexhaustible nature of dharma.

**Commentary:** *The Sage*, though not stagnant in words and teachings,
Yet uses the flavor of the law to guide the common folk,
Exhausting all to give to them—
In the Sage’s pure and luminous dharma-nature,
There is no depletion, only greater clarity—
Hence, the more one gives, the more one possesses.

Self-illumination comes from inherent nature,
External illumination brings added understanding.
**Commentary:** *Exhaust*—fulfillment.
*The Sage*, though not stagnant in words and teachings,
Yet when beings awaken to wisdom,
They must rely on the Sage’s guidance—
Thus, the Sage fulfills the common folk with pure and luminous rationality.

In the Sage’s innate wisdom and comprehension,
There is no depletion—
Hence, the more one gives, the more one possesses.
**Note:** *Self-illumination*—the nature of wisdom is not borrowed from others;
*External illumination*—the benefits of teaching do not arise from within oneself.
The Sage’s guidance to the common folk,
The more their wisdom is clarified—
Hence, the more one gives, the more one possesses.

Only those who grasp half the learning,
Their understanding grows ever clearer—
Hence, the more one possesses, the more one has.

**Explanation:** The Sage’s purity and stillness,
His rationality radiant and clear—
His wisdom relies on nothing external,
Nor is it hindered within.
The more it resonates with harmony,
Like a bell suspended in space.

Now, the generating and transforming of Heaven and Earth is boundless,
Yet Heaven and Earth’s operations are never weary;
The sun and moon shine without ceasing,
Yet their light is never exhausted;
Rivers and seas flow without end,
Yet their currents are never depleted;
The passing of firewood never ceases,
Yet the fire’s power is never spent.

So too, the Sage’s wisdom and comprehension are vast and boundless—
He speaks as wisdom arises,
Teaches according to circumstances,
Guides in response to aptitude,
And conforms to the nature of beings.

High or low, all attain the flavor of the law,
And the teachings fill the world—
Yet the Sage’s rationality and wisdom grow ever more abundant.

Only those who grasp half the learning—
*The Book of Documents* says: *"Irce"* means teaching,
And teaching reveals what one is constrained by.
This is the half of learning.

Always reflecting on learning from beginning to end,
Then one’s virtue’s cultivation cannot be self-aware—
Only through learning.

The Dao of Heaven,
Is beneficial yet does no harm.
**Commentary:** Heaven’s Dao nourishes life,
And fosters all things—this is benefit.
It does no slaughtering or harm—this is non-harm.
This is used to illustrate the Sage’s Dao’s broad benefit.

**Explanation:** Heaven’s Dao is used to illustrate the Sage’s Dao,
Which benefits all beings—
Things fulfill their growth,
And suffer no harm.
The Sage’s Dao,
Acts yet does not contend.
**Note:** Heaven’s Dao benefits beings without harm,
To show the Sage’s Dao in action is broadly beneficial,
Always giving to others—
Thus, there is no contention.

**Commentary:** The Sage’s Dao,
All actions taken for others are without contention—
This is the Sage’s non-stagnation,
Giving to others only increases what he possesses—
Hence, there is no contention.

**Explanation:** Heaven bestows the Sage’s Dao to benefit all beings,
The Sage embodies the Dao in response to Heaven to save all life.
The more his benevolence spreads, the more humble his intent,
The more his transformation shines, the more his deeds are concealed—
Thus, he benefits beings without harm,
Responds to beings without contention.

Moreover, these two *Canons* discuss the Dao and expound on virtue—
First, they clarify the *Dao that can be spoken* and the *constant Dao*,
As the root of all teaching.
Next, they mark the distinction between *having virtue* and *lacking virtue*,
Describing the refinement of crude and pure in time.
This sets forth the principle of *the more one gives, the more one possesses*,
And displays the Sage’s benevolence as boundless.

It can be transmitted through all ages,
And its patterns endure for millennia—
Transforming the corrupt and returning to simplicity,
Purging evil and returning to truth,
Piercing Heaven and Earth while illuminating the hidden and the bright.

This is the grand essence of the two *Canons*.
The *True Classic of the Dao and Virtue* concludes its broad exposition of the Sage’s meaning in the fifty-fifth chapter.
