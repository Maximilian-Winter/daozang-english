**Wenzi**
Wenzi, surnamed Xin, given name Xing, also named Jiran, was a native of Puyang in Kuiqiu. He studied under Laozi. King Ping of Chu asked him, "I have heard that you received the Dao from Lao Dan. May I be permitted to hear of it?" Wenzi replied, "The Dao and virtue rectify the crooked to make it straight, and restore order from chaos. When pure virtue revives, the world attains peace, and the key lies in one man. Thus, the accumulation of virtue makes a king, while the accumulation of wrath leads to ruin. Yao and Shun flourished by this principle, while Jie and Zhou perished by it." The king said, "I respectfully receive your instruction."

Later, Wenzi traveled south to Wu and Yue, where Fan Li became his disciple. When Yue planned to attack Wu, Fan Li remonstrated, "Your servant has heard from his master: 'Weapons are instruments of ill omen. War is contrary to virtue. Strife is the least of affairs. To plot in secret and delight in instruments of ill omen, testing oneself in what is least important—this will not do.'" Goujian did not heed him and was defeated at Fujiao. Later, Wenzi was offered the position of Grand Minister but declined. He withdrew to Mount Yu in Wuxing. Tradition holds that he ascended on clouds. According to the *Universal Geography* and the *Gazetteer of Wuxing*, thirty *li* southeast of Yuying lies Jichou Mountain, where the Grand Minister of Yue, Jiran, once ascended to survey the terrain, hence its name. Today, the Tongxuan Abbey atop White Stone Peak on the mountain’s south face marks his former retreat. The Ziyun Pass and Shengyuan Abbey were once the ancient Changqing Abbey, renamed by imperial decree during the Qiandao era of the Song. Halfway up the mountain stands the "Cloud-Ascending Stone." Wenzi composed twelve chapters, titled *Wenzi*, and during the Tang dynasty, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected of Penetrating the Mysteries, while his book was titled *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries*.

**Preface to the Comprehensive Annotations on the Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries**
The *Wenzi* is a transmission of the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*. Laozi based his work on the *Book of Changes* to compose his text, while Wenzi modeled himself on Laozi to establish his teachings. Thus, he elucidated the Way of the Yellow Emperor and the Three Sovereigns. For those who would be rulers, he prescribed the governance of Fuxi and the Divine Farmer; for the people, he envisioned the era of Datian and Getian. His concern for the world was profound indeed. Yet later generations failed to fathom his intent, and some even slandered his work.

Now the Recluse of Nangu, Master Du, delved into the profundities of the *Book of Changes* and Laozi, harmonizing the teachings of Confucianism and Daoism, ever holding the composition of texts and the establishment of discourse as his heart’s intent. Among his works that circulated in the world was *The Original Purport of the Dao and Its Virtue* in several scrolls. Initially dwelling on Mount Jishou in Wuxing, he sought the extraordinary and inquired into antiquity, discovering the former abode of Wenzi. There, he founded the White Stone Abbey of Penetrating the Mysteries and recovered *The Complete Works of Wenzi*. Thus, he divided its chapters, parsed its sentences, compiled annotations with appended explications, enabling learners to perceive the Dao with a single glance.

I have often said that since the opening of Heaven and Earth, the celestial Way has flowed from north to south, and the sagely dynasty, tracing its origins, holds the primal destiny of the northern lands. Once the Six Directions are unified as one household, the age of primordial vastness is restored. Today, the Recluse of Nangu, responding to the mandate, composes texts to illuminate the imperial Dao, seeking to place this world within the realm of Huaxu. That a recluse of the mountains and forests does not forget the heart of aiding the ruler and benefiting the people is truly worthy of esteem. Our teaching has found its man, and thus I joyfully inscribe this preface.

In the third year of the Zhida era, on the first day of the sixth month, Wu Quanjie, the Lineage Master of the Mysterious Teaching, respectfully wrote.

In antiquity, when scholars served their families and states, they invariably had recluses beyond the world as their teachers, honing and tempering them, imparting their texts, and exhausting their teachings, so that their achievements were accomplished and their names established. Among them was the Grand General of Yue, Fan Li, whose teacher was Jiran. Jiran personally beheld the sages in the declining Zhou, yet harbored his supreme treasure without display. He thoroughly investigated the celestial Way, human affairs, the rise and fall of strength and weakness, and the principles of spontaneity, composing twelve scrolls. Fan Li applied these to pacify Wu and establish Yue’s hegemony, and later, with their remaining threads, preserved his life and enriched his household, accumulating and dispersing thrice, safeguarding his illustrious name. Observing Fan Li’s beginning and end confirms the truth of his teacher’s Way; examining Fan Li’s repeated remonstrances to Goujian reveals that they were all his teacher’s words. His work ranks among the Daoist masters.

Liu Zihou pruned its redundancies and contradictions, extracting its essence and subtleties to form his own text, which elucidated its meaning well, though regrettably it did not survive. Master Nangu, following maps, discovered the mountain of Jiran’s former residence, perched upon its towering peaks, gazing down upon the vast expanse of Lake Tai. Having built a chamber to emulate its likeness, he further took *Wenzi* to compile annotations, fusing and penetrating its depths, smoothing its ruggedness, and unfolding the hidden treasures of the Yellow Emperor and the hegemons. Alongside his *Original Purport of the Mysterious Scripture*, it now circulates in the world. The Master is a man of the Way—his purity, diligence, frugality, and non-contention yet mastery of victory deeply embody the essence of the Keeper of the Pillars. His words and deeds, as seen in the discourses of officials and commoners alike, have already been engraved in stone and printed on fine woodblocks.

Yet Sima Qian’s appraisal of Tao Zhu laments his toiling body and striving strength in deep counsel with Yue, and again notes his toiling body and striving strength to amass wealth of tens of millions, repeating himself without weariness. In this, the Master’s affairs differ, yet their merit is the same; his name is lofty, yet he does not enjoy its riches. Thus, what he has gained from Jiran’s work—how could it lie in the mere ends of written characters and sentences? Separated by a thousand years, they truly seem to align as if tallying tokens.

It is regrettable that while many eminent officials and great men know the Master, and not a few have come to his gate to inquire of the Way, they have yet to fully employ his teachings as the ancients did in statecraft. Is it that their faith in the Way is not yet sincere? Do the recluses of the mountains and forests not forget this world, while the meat-eating officials do? If not, then why do they revere our Laozi’s Way as they do?

Thus, I record the origins of Fan Li and his teacher at the head of this text, awaiting the era of Great Flourishing.

In the mid-summer of the Gengxu year, Huang Shiweng, a Daoist of Mount Lu residing at the Lodge of the Southern Perfected, inscribed this.

Those who ruled all under Heaven in antiquity: the highest practiced non-action, the next practiced action. Thus, the August One transformed through the Dao, the Emperor taught through virtue, the King exhorted through merit, and the Hegemon led through force. Their governance was like the four seasons. The celestial Way flows on its own—it is not something human effort can compel. Yet while times may be opportune for action, the Dao is never ultimately obstructed. Winter transforms, and spring endures within the year; the Hegemon transforms, and the August One endures within the ruler. This is why Wenzi composed his work, and the imperial Dao was illuminated.

Wenzi was a grandson of the state of Jin, surnamed Xin, named Xing, styled Jiran, and known by his epithet, Wenzi. His family resided in Kuiqiu of Sui, a region of Song, and he was also called Song Xing. He studied under Laozi and early attained the great Dao. He composed twelve scrolls, titled *Wenzi*, which returned to Laozi’s words, expounding the Way of Heaven and humanity, the appropriateness of temporal changes, and gathering the essence of all antiquity into a single compilation—truly the pivot and essentials of ordering the world. King Ping of Chu summoned him to inquire of the Way, and Fan Li followed him as his teacher, with Goujian appointing him as a grandee. Assisting Yue in pacifying Wu, he achieved merit without claiming it, retiring to the lands of Mount Yu, where he ascended the clouds and departed as an immortal. The region of Jishou in Wuxing was his former abode.

During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, the scholar Xu Lingfu, who had secluded himself for cultivation on Mount Heng, presented Wenzi’s work to the throne. Thus, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected of Penetrating the Mysteries, and his book was titled *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries*.

Born on the left bank of the Yangtze and aging in the land of Wu, I sought the remnants of Wenzi’s legacy and built the White Stone Abbey of Penetrating the Mysteries. There, I obtained Wenzi’s original compilation. In my leisure, I divided its chapters and compiled annotations, assisting in the flourishing of the mysterious wind. As for the distinctions between transformation and teaching, exhortation and leading, the merit of virtue and the efficacy of force—these are not without hope for the world’s great worthies.

The humble disciple, Du Daojian of Nangu in Dangtu, respectfully inscribed this preface.

**Comprehensive Annotations on the Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries, Scroll One**
Compiled by Du Daojian, the Master of Nangu

At the beginning of each chapter, *Wenzi* frequently cites "Laozi says," out of reverence for his teacher. This likely records Laozi’s words as they were learned at the time, and thus he dared not claim authorship for himself. The work comprises twelve scrolls, totaling one hundred and eighty-eight chapters. Though I, Daojian, am of shallow and crude understanding, I have divided them according to their meanings, adding eighty-one chapters. Each chapter is distinguished by its purport and titled *Comprehensive Annotations* to facilitate perusal.

**Chapter on the Origin of the Dao**

Laozi says: There is a thing formed in chaos, born before Heaven and Earth. It has appearance but no form, profound and obscure, silent and serene. No sound is heard from it. I force a name upon it and call it the Dao.

Now, the Dao is lofty beyond reach, deep beyond measure. It embraces Heaven and Earth, bestowing without form. Its source flows ceaselessly, empty yet never full. When turbid, it slowly clarifies through stillness. Its giving is inexhaustible, unbound by time. Though it may be held in a single grasp, it contracts yet expands, dark yet luminous, soft yet firm. It harbors yin and exhales yang, manifesting the three lights.

Mountains rise by it, abysses deepen by it. Beasts run by it, birds fly by it. Scales glide by it, phoenixes soar by it. Stars and constellations move by it.

By loss it gains existence, by humility it attains honor, by retreat it advances first.

The Dao originates in Heaven, and the myriad things grow thereby.

The Dao is but a forced name—what name is not forced?

Thus, that which gives birth to Heaven and Earth, nurtures the myriad things, transforms being and non-being, and eludes comprehension of its mystery is the Dao. That which pacifies the world, comforts the multitudes, governs advance and retreat, life and death, without losing its correctness is the sage.

Only by knowing the Dao can loss become existence, humility become honor, and retreat become precedence.

In ancient times, the Three Sovereigns grasped the essence of the Dao. Standing at the center, their spirits roamed with transformation, governing the four directions. Thus, they could turn the heavens and move the earth, wheeling without cease, flowing like water without end. They began and ended with things, wind rising and clouds forming, thunder rumbling and rain falling, all responding without limit.

Carved and polished, they returned to simplicity.

Acting without action, they harmonized life and death. Speaking without words, they penetrated Dao and virtue. Serene and unassuming, they attained harmony. Though things differ in myriad ways, they all thrive thereby.

They harmonized yin and yang, regulated the four seasons, balanced the five phases, moistened grasses and trees, permeated metal and stone. Beasts grew large, fur and feathers lustrous. Bird eggs did not spoil, beast fetuses did not miscarry. Fathers knew no grief for lost sons, elder brothers no sorrow for dead younger brothers. Children were not orphaned, women not widowed. Rainbows did not appear, thieves did not arise—such were the fruits of embodying virtue.

The rulers of high antiquity took the Heavenly Dao as the foundation of governance, roaming in unity with creation.

Thus, when Dao was pure and virtue complete, the people prospered and things flourished, each fulfilling its nature.

When the Dao was not violated, nothing was harmed.

The great constant Dao gives life without possession, transforms without dominion. The myriad things depend on it to live, yet none know its virtue; depend on it to die, yet none can resent it.

It gathers and stores without growing richer, distributes and bestows without becoming poorer.

Vague and indistinct, it cannot be grasped as form. Elusive and fleeting, its use is inexhaustible. Profound and obscure, it responds without shape. Penetrating and unobstructed, it moves not in vain. It coils and unfurls with hardness and softness, rises and falls with yin and yang.

It gives life without being born, transforms without transforming—this is called the great constant Dao.

The sage follows it, ruling the world and cherishing the people as children.

When transformation flows and Dao aligns, it is an age of flourishing virtue.

Laozi says: The great man is tranquil and thoughtless, composed and carefree. He takes Heaven as his canopy, Earth as his chariot, the four seasons as his horses, and yin and yang as his drivers.

He travels where there are no roads, roams without weariness, departs without gates.

Taking Heaven as his canopy, nothing is left uncovered. Taking Earth as his chariot, nothing is left uncarried. Taking the four seasons as his horses, nothing is left uncommanded. Taking yin and yang as his drivers, nothing is left unguided.

Thus, he moves swiftly without swaying, travels far without fatigue. His limbs do not stir, his hearing and vision do not falter, yet he illuminates all under Heaven—this is the essence of holding the Dao and observing the boundless.

Therefore, the affairs of the world cannot be forced; one must follow their natural course and guide them. The changes of the myriad things cannot be fathomed; one must grasp their essentials and return to them.

Thus, the sage cultivates the root within and does not adorn the branches without. He sharpens his spirit and stills his knowledge and perceptions. Thus, he is effortlessly without action yet accomplishes all, governs without governing yet nothing is left ungoverned.

The so-called "non-action" is not acting before things do. The so-called "non-governance" is not altering the natural. The so-called "nothing left ungoverned" is following the mutual arising of things.

The Dao resides within me, uniting with Heaven as one.

A state’s ministers and aides are like Heaven’s seasons and times.

When the great man emerges to assist a wise ruler, governing the people’s fate, observing the celestial timing, understanding the principles of things, following the Dao of nature, and enacting the transformation of non-action, then his person is cultivated, and governance knows no disorder.

Laozi says: He who holds the Dao to govern the people responds to events as they arise, follows things as they move. The transformations of the myriad things all find their answer; the changes of the hundred affairs all find their match.

Thus, the Dao is emptiness and nothingness, levelness and ease, clarity and stillness, softness and weakness, purity and simplicity—these five are the forms and images of the Dao.

Emptiness and nothingness are the Dao’s abode. Levelness and ease are the Dao’s essence. Clarity and stillness are the Dao’s mirror. Softness and weakness are the Dao’s function. Reversion is the Dao’s constant. Softness is the Dao’s hardness. Weakness is the Dao’s strength. Purity and simplicity are the Dao’s trunk.

The great Dao has no form; great peace has no image—hence, emptiness and nothingness.

Levelness and ease, clarity and stillness, softness and weakness, purity and simplicity—these are the Dao.

As for forms and images, are they truly forms? Are they truly images? Only he who does not cling to forms and images and thereby attains the use of the profound and mysterious can be spoken to of the Dao of governing the people.

Emptiness means the center bears no burden. Levelness means the heart harbors no cares. Desires and cravings not borne—this is the perfection of emptiness. No preferences or aversions—this is the perfection of levelness. Unchanging unity—this is the perfection of stillness. Unmixed with things—this is the perfection of purity. Neither sorrow nor joy—this is the perfection of virtue.

The Supreme Ultimate is centered in emptiness; spirit and clarity abide with it. When a person’s heart is empty, the Dao naturally resides within. If even one thing is borne, desires and cravings will obstruct; likes and dislikes will arise, and spirit will depart. When spirit departs, the Dao is lost—how then can the body not perish? Only one of perfect virtue remains unmixed with things, unwavering in unity, the heart empty and qi level—what sorrow or joy could there be?

The governance of the perfected person discards cleverness and erases ornamentation, relying on the Dao and abandoning cunning, emerging with the people from impartiality. Narrowing what is guarded, reducing what is sought, casting aside allurements and desires, diminishing thoughts and cares—narrowing what is guarded brings clarity; reducing what is sought brings attainment. Thus, with the inner regulating the outer, no affair is neglected. If the inner attains, the outer can be shepherded. When the inner attains, the five viscera are at peace, thoughts are level, sinews and bones are strong, ears and eyes are keen.

The great Dao is smooth and broad, not far from the self—those who seek it afar go forth only to return. Ornament obscures substance; broad learning drowns the heart. When the external is heavy, the internal is light—thus the great man dwells in reality, not in its blossoms.

The governance of the perfected person has no other way—reverent silence and non-action alone. Turning inward to seek the Dao—how distant is it? Laozi said: The sage forgets governing others and attends to self-cultivation; esteems forgetting power and position and attends to self-attainment—self-attainment is when the world attains me. Joy forgets wealth and honor and attains harmony; knowing the great self and diminishing the world—this approaches the Dao.

Thus it is said: Attain utmost emptiness, guard stillness firmly. The myriad things arise together, and I observe their return. The sage is without fame, not forgetting their merit; the spirit person is without merit, not forgetting the self. The perfected person is without self—not that they lack a body, but that they enlarge the self and diminish the world.

Only those who act with something to rely upon—thus the sage’s great treasure is position. The Dao shapes and nurtures the ten thousand kinds, beginning and ending without form, still and unmoving, greatly penetrating and profoundly obscure, vast and boundless—it cannot be made external; splitting the finest hair or dividing the smallest point cannot make it internal. Without walls or roof, it gives birth to the general name of being and non-being.

The true person embodies it with emptiness and nothingness, levelness and ease, clarity and stillness, softness and weakness, purity and simplicity, remaining unmixed with things—thus attaining the Dao of heaven and earth, and so called a true person. The Dao has no form, thus it can shape and nurture the ten thousand things; the Dao has no name, thus it can encompass all existents. The true person embodies the Dao, emptying the heart and stilling the spirit—thus attaining the Dao of heaven and earth.

The true person enlarges the self and diminishes the world, esteems governing the body and disdains governing others, does not allow things to disturb harmony, does not let desires confuse the emotions, conceals their name and identity—when the Dao is present, they remain hidden; when the Dao is absent, they appear. They practice non-action, engage in non-affairs, know non-knowing.

Embracing the great Dao, encompassing the heart of heaven, exhaling and inhaling yin and yang, expelling the old and taking in the new, closing with yin, opening with yang, rolling and unfolding with hardness and softness, bowing and rising with yin and yang, sharing the heart of heaven, sharing the body of the Dao. Without joy, without suffering, without delight, without anger, the myriad things are profoundly the same—without right, without wrong.

When the body is harmed by the ravages of cold, heat, dryness, and dampness, the body is exhausted and spirit is blocked; when spirit is harmed by the afflictions of joy, anger, thought, and care, spirit is spent and the body remains in excess. Thus the true person employs the heart to restore nature, relying on spirit for mutual support, thereby attaining beginning and end. Therefore, their sleep is dreamless, and their waking is without sorrow.

Bending outwardly—this is the human Dao; straightening inwardly—this is the heavenly Dao. Inwardly straight and outwardly bending, heaven and humanity correspond—there has never been one who did not succeed. Thus the true person conceals their name and identity—when the Dao is present, they remain hidden, not usurping others’ merit; when the Dao is absent, they appear, to remedy the age’s ills.

Only one who shares the heart of heaven and the body of the Dao can restore nature and rely on spirit, mutually supporting to attain beginning and end. Confucius asked the Dao of Laozi, who said: Correct your form, unify your gaze, and heavenly harmony will arrive; gather your knowledge, rectify your measures, and spirit will come to dwell. Virtue will adorn you, the Dao will be your abode. Bright-eyed as a newborn calf, without seeking the old; form like withered wood, heart like dead ashes—truly knowing reality without crookedness, thus self-sustaining and expansive, no heart to scheme, luminous in all four directions—can one be without knowledge?

The Dao has substance and function; the sage has no dual heart. The mysterious sage and the unadorned king—substance and function are two, but the Dao is one. Confucius, a sage of heaven’s endowment—how could he not know the Dao? Yet he asked Laozi, surely to gain what lies beyond words. Thus there is the deception of the dragon.

Laozi said: One who attends to life responds to change and acts; change arises from the times—one who knows the times has no constant conduct. Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. Writing arises from words; words emerge from knowledge—those with knowledge do not know, for it is not the constant Dao. The name that can be named is not one who hoards books.

Excessive words lead to exhaustion—better to guard the center. Cut off learning and be without sorrow; cut off sagacity and abandon knowledge, and the people benefit a hundredfold. Books carry words; words carry the Dao. Esteeming books is esteeming the Dao. Thus, one who knows the times responds to change when affairs arise; one who knows books—words emerge from knowledge, but those with knowledge do not know.

Only by not clinging to books nor stagnating in affairs, cutting off learning and abandoning knowledge, can one begin to speak of the art of responding to change.

Man is tranquil at birth—this is Heaven’s nature. Moved by things, he stirs—this is the desire of nature. When things arrive, he responds—this is the movement of knowledge. As knowledge engages with things, likes and dislikes arise; when likes and dislikes take form, knowledge turns outward, unable to return to the self, and Heaven’s principle is extinguished. Thus, the sage does not exchange Heaven for man, outwardly transforming with things while inwardly preserving true nature. Therefore, one who penetrates the Dao returns to clarity and stillness; one who exhausts things ends in non-action. Nurture knowledge with tranquility, unite the spirit with emptiness—thus entering the gateless gate.

Those who follow Heaven wander with the Dao; those who follow men mingle with the vulgar. Thus, the sage does not disturb Heaven with affairs, nor disorder true nature with desires. Without scheming, he is fitting; without speaking, he is trusted; without pondering, he attains; without acting, he accomplishes. Therefore, though he dwells above, the people do not find him burdensome; though he stands before them, none feel harmed. The world turns to him, the wicked fear him, for he contends with nothing—who then would dare contend with him?

Heaven’s nature is fundamentally still; worldly desires disturb it. When stillness moves, Heaven’s nature is defiled. Only the sage, outwardly transforming with things while his heart wanders with Heaven, merges self and other in profound unity—what contention could there be?

Laozi said: "When man follows desire, he loses his nature; his movements are never upright. With this, to govern a state is to bring chaos; to cultivate the self is to invite defilement." Thus, those who have not heard the Dao cannot return to their nature; those who do not understand things cannot attain clarity and stillness. Human nature is originally free from depravity—long immersed in things, it changes; changing, it forgets its root and merges with what seems natural.

Water’s nature desires clarity, yet sand and stone defile it; man’s nature desires equilibrium, yet cravings harm it. Only the sage can forsake things and return to the self. Thus, the sage does not enslave things with knowledge, nor disturb harmony with desire. In joy, he is not exuberant; in sorrow, he is not distressed. Therefore, though exalted, he is not imperiled; though secure, he does not topple. Hearing good words and expedient plans, even the foolish delight in them; praising sagely virtue and lofty conduct, even the unworthy admire them. Many delight in such words, but few employ them; many admire such conduct, but few practice it. The reason lies in being entangled by things and bound by custom.

Thus it is said: "I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I am without affairs, and the people prosper themselves; I love stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I am without desire, and the people simplify themselves." When the heart is still, it is bright; when water is still, it is clear—this is principle. If learning is not upright, habit shapes nature, and stillness becomes movement, clarity becomes obscurity. Encountering a worthy teacher and hearing good words, if the heart awakens, one may restore one’s nature.

Originally, Heaven united with the great Dao. Applying this to cultivate the self perfects the self; applying it to govern the state perfects the state. Thus, the sage’s Dao is this: above, he practices non-action, and the people transform themselves; above, he is without affairs, and the people prosper themselves; above, he loves stillness, and the people rectify themselves; above, he is without desire, and the people simplify themselves.

Clarity and stillness are the perfection of virtue; softness and weakness are the function of the Dao. Emptiness, tranquility, and joy are the ancestors of the myriad things. When these three are practiced, one merges with the formless—the formless is called the One. The One is the mindless union with all under Heaven.

Virtue is spread without irrigation; its use is not labored. It is seen yet unseen, heard yet unheard. From the formless, forms arise; from the soundless, the five notes resound; from the tasteless, the five flavors take shape; from the colorless, the five colors emerge. Thus, being arises from non-being, fullness from emptiness.

The number of notes does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five notes are inexhaustible to the ear; the number of flavors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five flavors are inexhaustible to the palate; the number of colors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five colors are inexhaustible to the eye. When the note *gong* is established, the five notes take form; when sweetness is established, the five flavors are determined; when whiteness is established, the five colors are complete; when the One is established, the myriad things are born.

Thus, the principle of the One extends throughout the four seas; the blessing of the One pervades Heaven and Earth. In its wholeness, it is simple as uncarved wood; in its dispersion, it is vast as turbid waters. Turbid, it gradually clears; empty, it gradually fills. Vast as the great sea, drifting like floating clouds—seemingly absent yet present, seemingly lost yet existing.

The Dao is formless yet gives birth to form, beginning in the beginningless, ending in the endless. The primordial qi arises from the Great Simplicity. Is the Great Simplicity not the ancestor of the myriad things? From the One come the Two, and yin and yang divide; the five qi spread, and the myriad transformations flourish.

The sage’s heart unites with the Great Simplicity—clear, still, empty, and void. Virtue covers the four seas, and the myriad things return to him, yet he does not act as their master. The Dao is great and formless, one with Heaven. As for the ear’s delight in sound, the eye’s delight in color, the mouth’s delight in flavor—these are what man shares with others. How could the sage take them to heart?

Laozi said: "The sum of the myriad things all passes through one opening; the root of a hundred affairs all emerges from one gate." Thus, the sage follows the single standard, does not alter the ancient ways, does not change the constant norms. He takes the level as his model, the plumb line as his guide, bending and conforming to the constant.

Joy and anger are the Dao’s perversities; sorrow and grief are virtue’s losses; likes and dislikes are the heart’s transgressions; cravings and desires are life’s burdens. Great anger shatters yin; great joy collapses yang; thin qi brings dimness; terror induces madness; sorrow and grief scorch the heart, and illness forms as accumulations. If one can eliminate these five, one unites with spirit brightness.

Spirit brightness is attained within. Those who attain it within find their five viscera at peace, thoughts and deliberations balanced, ears and eyes keen, sinews and bones strong and straight. Open and unobstructed, not perverse; firm and strong, not exhausted. Nothing in excess, nothing unattainable.

The Dao, does it not embrace all mysteries and encompass the myriad things? Through spirit it is made luminous, through resonance it is made penetrating—revealing the hidden, elucidating the subtle, present without exception. Thus, things obtain it and flourish; the people obtain it and thrive; the timely ruler obtains it and may embody the august standard to govern the four quarters.

Nothing in the world is more yielding than water, yet in water lies the Dao. Its breadth cannot be fathomed, its depth cannot be sounded; its length stretches without end, its reach extends without limit. Its ebb and flow, its gain and loss, surpass all reckoning. Above, it becomes heaven’s rain and dew; below, it becomes earth’s moisture and nourishment. Without it, the myriad things cannot live; without it, the hundred affairs cannot be accomplished. It embraces all life without partiality, bestows grace upon dragons and serpents without seeking repayment, enriches the world without exhaustion, extends virtue to the people without depletion. Its course cannot be exhausted, its subtlety cannot be grasped. Bind it and it is not constrained; pierce it and it is not wounded; sever it and it is not cut; scorch it and it is not scorched. Flowing and compliant, it cannot be scattered; its benefit penetrates metal and stone, pervades the world. Surplus or deficiency, it allows the world to take or give; it receives the myriad things without preference, without partiality or impartiality, vast and equal to heaven and earth—this is called utmost virtue.

That water can perfect its utmost virtue lies in its softness, compliance, and smoothness. Thus it is said: The softest in the world gallops through the hardest; nothing enters where there is no gap. The One generates water, which beneficially nourishes the myriad things—its merit is most vast. Heaven without water cannot revolve; earth without water cannot bear; things without water cannot live; the people without water cannot survive. Rain and dew in the four seasons moisten and nourish all species. Flowing and compliant, dwelling below without contention, Yu’s virtue resembled it—thus he could accord with water’s nature and bring the earth to order, heaven to completion.

The formless is the great ancestor of things; the soundless is the great progenitor of kinds. The perfected person communicates with the numinous treasury, becoming one with the creator, holding profound virtue in the heart, and transforming like a spirit. Thus, the Dao that is not a Dao—how vast and indistinct it is! Without issuing commands or decrees, it shifts customs and alters mores—this is the power of conduct in the heart.

The myriad things have their origins, yet only the Dao knows their roots; the hundred affairs have their sources, yet only the Dao guards their gates. Thus it can exhaust the inexhaustible, reach the unreachable, illuminate things without dazzling, respond without knowing. The Dao has no fixed form; it assumes form according to things—transformation is manifest. Virtue has no constant teacher; it takes goodness as its teacher—substance and function are attained.

Thus the perfected person harbors the Dao and virtue, communicates with spirit brightness. Things have their origins—only the Dao knows their roots. Affairs have their sources—only the Dao guards their gates. Inexhaustible and boundless, it becomes one with the creator. Laozi said: Those who attain the Dao have a will that is weak yet their affairs are strong; their hearts are empty yet their responses are fitting. A weak will is soft, delicate, tranquil, concealed in not daring, acting in not being able, serene and non-active, moving without missing the moment. Thus the noble must take the lowly as its foundation, the high must take the low as its base. Relying on the small to embrace the great, being within to control the external, acting with softness yet being firm, its strength is invincible, its enemies undefeatable. Responding to transformations and measuring the times, nothing can harm it.

Those who desire firmness must guard it with softness; those who desire strength must preserve it with weakness. Accumulated softness becomes firmness; accumulated weakness becomes strength. Observe what is accumulated to know survival or demise. Strength overcomes what is inferior to itself, yet when it encounters its equal, it is checked. Softness overcomes what surpasses itself—its power is immeasurable. Thus, when armies are strong, they perish; when trees are strong, they break; when leather is strong, it splits. The teeth are firmer than the tongue yet perish first. Thus softness and weakness are the stems of life; firmness and strength are the companions of death. When things turn against me, the Dao abides in the heart.

Knowing my heaven, knowing others’ heaven, and knowing things’ heaven—this is attainment. Water is utterly soft, yet when it bears a boat, it is firm; the people are utterly weak, yet when they support a ruler, they are strong. Those who skillfully employ the Dao can guard softness and weakness to overcome firmness and strength. The first to sing paves the path to exhaustion; the last to act reaches the source of success.

Those who hold the Dao to pair with change—whether first or last, they control the other. Why? They do not lose what controls others, and others cannot control them. The so-called "last" adjusts its calculations to align with the time. When time changes, the interval does not allow for pause. Acting first is excessive; acting last is insufficient. The sun revolves, the moon cycles—time does not wait for people. Thus the sage does not value a foot of jade but values an inch of time. Time is hard to obtain yet easy to lose, so the sage acts according to the time, establishes merit according to resources, upholds the pure Dao, adheres to the feminine principle, follows along and responds to change, always remaining behind yet never ahead. Soft and weak in stillness, tranquil and composed in stability, their achievements are vast and nothing is too firm—they cannot be contested.

When affairs arise, respond—the Dao values attaining the mean. Excess and deficiency both harm affairs. Only by not losing the proper time in first and last is the mean attained and all affairs accomplished. Thus the sage’s appearance and withdrawal are timely, their first and last have measure. If I do not lose control over others, then others cannot control me.

Laozi said: When the heart harbors scheming, purity is not unsullied. When spiritual virtue is not complete in the body, how can one embrace what is distant? When the heart forgets the desire to harm, even a starving tiger can be tailed—how much more so with people?

Those who embody the Dao are at ease yet not exhausted; those who rely on calculations are laborious yet without achievement. Ruling through laws, punishments, and executions is not the enterprise of emperors and kings; frequent use of the whip and rod is not the way to govern for the long term. Excessive likes and dislikes bring calamity in their wake. Thus the laws of the former kings were not what they created but what they followed; their prohibitions and punishments were not what they enacted but what they upheld.

Thus, to follow is great, to create is petty; to uphold is firm, to act is to fail. Grasping at schemes and pursuing a starving tiger—one barely escapes the tiger’s jaws. Only when I harbor no scheming heart does the tiger bring no harm.

Therefore, those who embody the Dao are at ease, while those who rely on calculations are laborious. The principles of the world are not difficult to perceive: what is easy is readily known, what is simple is readily followed. When laws lack the harshness of punishments, governance becomes effortless; when governance dispenses with the frequent use of the whip, it can endure for the long term. Thus, the laws of the former kings were not what they created but what they followed; their prohibitions were not to suppress evil but to uphold what was right. Only thus could they establish a lasting and great enterprise.

Those who rely on ears and eyes for hearing and seeing exhaust the heart yet remain unclear; those who govern through cunning and planning strain the heart yet achieve nothing. Relying on the talents of one person is insufficient to bring order; the ability of one person cannot even govern a three-acre homestead. Yet by following the principles of the Dao and aligning with the natural order of Heaven and Earth, the Six Directions are not too vast to harmonize.

To lose judgment in praise or blame, to be dazzled by gaudy colors, to rely on ritual alone is insufficient to restrain desire—only a sincere heart can embrace what is distant. Thus, no weapon is sharper than the will, yet fine blades are inferior; no enemy is greater than yin and yang, yet war drums are trivial. The greatest foe lies in unspoken restraints, the middling hides in the mountains, the petty lurks among the people.

Thus it is said: when the people abound in cleverness, strange things proliferate; when laws and decrees multiply, thieves and bandits flourish. To reject one and adopt the other is to invite no heavenly calamity. Therefore, to govern a state through cunning is to plunder it; to govern without cunning is to bless it. When seeing and hearing are labored, the heart is unclear; when schemes and plans are overburdened, affairs are ungoverned. To rely on the talents of one person to seek order is difficult indeed.

A sincere heart can embrace what is distant; collective strength can achieve success—even the Six Directions are not too vast to harmonize. What ails the body is crowned by yin and yang; what plunders the state is crowned by treachery. To govern without cunning is the fortune of the state.

What is formless is great, what has form is petty; what is formless is abundant, what has form is scant; what is formless is strong, what has form is weak; what is formless is solid, what has form is hollow. What has form is the completion of affairs, what is formless is their inception. The completion of affairs produces tools, their inception is uncarved simplicity. What has form has sound, what is formless has no sound; what has form arises from what is formless—thus what is formless is the beginning of what has form.

Vastness and thickness bear names, and what bears a name is prized for its wholeness; frugality and thinness are nameless, and what is nameless is base and light. Abundance bears a name, and what bears a name is honored and esteemed; poverty and scarcity are nameless, and what is nameless is lowly and despised. The male bears a name, and what bears a name manifests virtue; the female is nameless, and what is nameless remains hidden and restrained. Surplus bears a name, and what bears a name is exalted and wise; deficiency is nameless, and what is nameless is assigned to the lowly. Merit brings a name, lack of merit brings none. What bears a name arises from what is nameless—what is nameless is the mother of what bears a name.

The Dao gives rise to being and non-being, difficulty and ease complete one another. Thus the sage holds to the Dao’s emptiness, stillness, subtlety, and mystery to perfect their virtue. Therefore, where there is the Dao, there is virtue; where there is virtue, there is merit; where there is merit, there is a name; where there is a name, there is a return to the Dao. Merit and name endure, and one remains free from fault throughout life.

All things under Heaven arise from being, being arises from non-being—thus what is formless is the beginning of what has form. The Dao is nameless, things bear names, yet the nameless is the mother of what bears a name. Know which is closer: name or self? Which is weightier: self or wealth? Then name need not be exalted, wealth need not be abundant.

Thus the sage holds to the Dao to perfect their virtue. With merit accomplished, they withdraw—from ancient times to the present, their name does not fade. Kings and lords possess merit and name, the orphaned and widowed possess neither. Thus it is said: the sage calls themselves orphaned and widowed, returning to their root. With merit accomplished, they do not claim it—thus they use merit for benefit and namelessness for function.

In ancient times, the people were simple and unknowing, unaware of east or west. Their appearance did not depart from their nature, their words did not exceed their actions, their conduct required no adornment, their speech was unembellished. Their clothes provided warmth without ornament, their weapons were blunt and unsharpened. They walked with unsteady steps, gazed with unfocused eyes, dug wells to drink, tilled fields to eat. They neither bestowed nor sought virtue. High and low did not vie, long and short did not compare.

Customs were uniform and could be followed, tasks matched abilities and were easily performed. Those who flaunted deceit to delude the world or behaved erratically to mislead the masses—the sage did not make this the people’s way.

In ancient times, the people were simple and unknowing, unaware of east or west. Their speech was unadorned, their clothes uncolored. They tilled to eat, dug wells to drink, neither bestowed nor sought, each content with their own.

Thus kings and great lords called themselves orphaned and widowed, and those who possessed the Dao did not destroy themselves for name, did not kill the people with governance, did not exhaust descendants with wealth, did not harm the world with learning. Later generations did not burden their hearts with merit, name, profit, or emolument. Who would willingly flaunt deceit to delude the world or behave erratically to mislead the masses?

**Chapter on Sincerity**

Laozi said: Heaven attains its height, earth attains its depth; the sun and moon shine, the stars in their ranks gleam; yin and yang harmonize—yet none of this is by deliberate action.

Align with the Dao, and things arise of themselves. Yin and yang, the four seasons, do not generate the myriad things; timely rain and dew do not nurture grasses and trees. Yet when numinous clarity meets, when yin and yang harmonize, the myriad things are born.

The Dao conceals essence within, shelters spirit in the heart, still and silent, serene and unperturbed, joyfully at peace in the breast. Vast and formless, silent and soundless—government offices as if empty, the court as if deserted. No recluses, no idle folk, no forced labor, no unjust punishments. All under heaven gaze upward in reverence of the ruler’s virtue, in emulation of the sovereign’s intent. Even distant lands of alien customs, none fail to arrive through successive interpreters—not because they journey to each household to meet the people, but because the ruler extends his sincere heart to all under heaven.

Thus, to reward the good and punish the violent is to issue commands; what enables their execution is sincerity. Commands, though clear, cannot act alone—they must await sincerity. Therefore, when the Dao is universally applied to the people yet they do not follow, it is because sincerity has not reached them.

The sages of antiquity governed heaven and earth, administered the myriad things, stored essence and preserved sincerity—formless and soundless. They aligned with the Dao and entrusted things to their own nature. In that age, the court had no favored ministers, the wilds no neglected recluses, the state no vagrant people. Weapons were not raised, labor was not imposed, and the four classes delighted in their work. Thus, without visiting each household to instruct the people, supreme peace was effortlessly achieved.

Laozi said: Heaven established the sun and moon, arrayed the stars, extended the four seasons, and regulated yin and yang. Day exposes, night rests; wind dries, rain and dew moisten. In generating things, none see its nurturance, yet the myriad things grow. In destroying things, none see its nurturance, yet the myriad things perish—this is called numinous clarity.

Thus, the sage emulates this: when blessings arise, none see their cause, yet blessings arise; when calamities are removed, none see their source, yet calamities vanish. Searched, they cannot be found; examined, they are not empty. Daily reckoning falls short, yearly reckoning exceeds. Silent and soundless, a single word stirs all under heaven—this is the movement of the celestial heart through transformation.

Thus, sincerity shapes qi within, moving heaven. Auspicious stars appear, yellow dragons descend, phoenixes arrive, sweet springs flow, fine grains grow. Rivers do not overflow, seas do not surge. The sun, moon, and stars are the spirits of heaven; water, fire, earth, and stone are the spirits of earth. Rain, wind, dew, thunder, heat, cold, day, and night—all are spirits. Human nature is most numinous, surpassing all things in spirit.

Heaven nurtures things without revealing its care, yet daily they grow. The sage nurtures the people, removing harm and promoting benefit, doing likewise. All arises from sincerity manifesting within, qi moving heaven, yin and yang aligning, numinous spirits aiding—thus auspicious omens arrive.

To defy heaven and ravage things is to invite the sun and moon’s eclipse, the five stars’ misalignment, the four seasons’ disorder. Day darkens, night brightens; mountains collapse, rivers run dry; winter thunders, summer frosts. Heaven and humanity communicate thus. When a state declines, celestial signs alter, customs decay, rainbows appear—all things interconnect, essence and qi clash.

Therefore, the workings of the numinous cannot be achieved by cunning or forced by strength. Thus, the great person joins virtue with heaven and earth, brightness with the sun and moon, numinosity with ghosts and spirits, and trustworthiness with the four seasons. Embracing the celestial heart, holding the earthly qi, grasping the mean and containing harmony, they do not leave their hall yet traverse the four seas, transforming customs. The people reform as if by their own will—this is the power of spiritual transformation.

Heaven and humanity share one qi, the hidden and manifest interpenetrate. Harmonious qi brings blessings; pestilential qi brings misfortune—none arise apart from the ruler. Thus, to defy heaven and ravage things, to violate the Dao and corrupt virtue, is to provoke the wrath of august heaven, and calamity follows.

As when King Cheng repented his errors, the grain stalks bent and the wind reversed; when the Lord of Song spoke a single word, the Fire Star retreated—these were signs of sincerity moving heaven, turning misfortune to fortune.

Laozi said: The human Dao is to preserve one’s nature and guard one’s authenticity, not to harm one’s body. When pressed by urgency or peril, essence connects with heaven. Those who have never departed from their origin—what could they not accomplish? Death and life share the same realm; they cannot be coerced.

Moreover, to govern heaven and earth, administer the myriad things, return to the creative process, and contain supreme harmony is to never die. Sincerity takes shape within and outwardly resonates with the human heart—this is the untransmitted Dao.

In life, all receive their mandate from heaven alike. Thus, nature is not without goodness. To preserve one’s nature and guard one’s authenticity, not to harm one’s body, to connect essence with heaven—what could not be achieved? To return to the creative process, contain supreme harmony, and never die—this is the true person.

When the sage rules above, embracing the Dao without speech, his beneficence extends to the myriad people. Thus, the teaching without words—how vast and boundless! When ruler and minister diverge in heart, deceit manifests in heaven, and the mutual resonance of spirit and qi is evident. This is the eloquence of the wordless, the Dao of the unspoken Dao.

To summon the distant, let there be no action; to draw close, let there be no speech. Only those who walk in darkness can attain this. Thus, horses are turned back to manure the fields, and chariot tracks do not reach beyond distant lands—this is called "sitting in stillness while galloping in obscurity."

The Dao of heaven is impartial in its approach, impartial in its departure—those who are capable have abundance, while the inept fall short. Those who follow it prosper; those who oppose it meet misfortune. Thus, governing through cunning makes it difficult to sustain a state; only by aligning with the Great Harmony and adhering to natural resonance can one attain this. The sage embraces the Dao, and his beneficence reaches the people—auspicious signs become visible. When ruler and minister diverge in heart, calamity manifests in heaven. The distant are summoned without action; the near are drawn close without speech. The mutual resonance of spirit and *qi* is evident—what need is there for summoning before they arrive?

Impartial in approach, impartial in departure, abundance and insufficiency—all align with the Great Harmony. The teaching without words is simply the natural course. Laozi said: The Dao and virtue are like leather and hide—distance makes them seem near, closeness makes them seem distant. Scrutiny yields no grasp, observation finds no emptiness. Thus, the sage is like a mirror: neither advancing nor retreating, responding without hoarding. The myriad things are unharmed—what he gains is but loss, what he loses is but gain.

Therefore, one who penetrates the Great Harmony is dark as if steeped in wine, sweetly reclining and roaming within it, as if never having departed from its source—this is called "great penetration." This is the use that arises from non-use. The Dao is revered, virtue is esteemed—they differ in name but emerge from the same source, residing within our hearts, not obtained from without. It gives life and nurtures, neither non-existent nor existent.

The heart of the sage is like a bright mirror: things arrive and it responds; things depart and it is still. Embracing sincerity, pure in virtue and power—what failure could there be? Without attachment, what loss could occur? As if never having departed from its source, even spirits and gods cannot discern it.

Laozi said: In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor ruled the world, harmonizing the movements of the sun and moon, regulating the *qi* of yin and yang, ordering the measures of the four seasons, rectifying the calculations of pitch and calendar. He distinguished male and female, clarified superior and inferior, ensuring the strong did not oppress the weak, the many did not tyrannize the few. The people preserved their lives without premature death; the years ripened without famine. The hundred officials were upright and impartial; superiors and inferiors were harmonious without blame. Laws and decrees were clear, not obscure; assistants were just, not sycophantic. Farmers yielded boundaries; roads were free of lost items; markets did not engage in preemptive pricing. Thus, in that time, the sun, moon, and stars did not deviate from their courses; wind and rain came in season; the five grains flourished; phoenixes soared in the courtyards, and qilin roamed the outskirts. Observing the Dao of heaven and grasping its workings, the Yellow Emperor attained governance of the world. Later, he relinquished the world, hastened to Kongtong, humbled himself to seek instruction, and asked Guangchengzi how to cultivate the body to achieve longevity.

Guangchengzi said: The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure. Its ultimate is dim and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness. The body will naturally rectify itself—be still, be pure. Do not weary your form, do not agitate your essence—only then can you attain long life.

When Fuxi ruled the world, he rested his head on stone and slept on rope, slaying in autumn and executing in winter. He bore the square earth and embraced the round heaven, enveloped by yin and yang. Those obstructed and stagnant—where *qi* and principle were perverse, harming the people and accumulating excess—he severed and halted them. His people were simple and unknowing, unaware of east or west, their sight dim, their steps faltering. Yet they were artless and content, unaware of their drifting, floating without knowing their origin, nurturing themselves without knowing their destination.

In that time, birds, beasts, insects, and snakes all sheathed their claws and fangs, concealed their stings and poisons—their achievements matched heaven and earth. Yet when the Yellow Emperor sought counsel beneath the Great Ancestor, he did not display his merits or proclaim his name, concealing the Dao of the true person to follow the inherent constancy of heaven and earth. Why? Because virtue and power ascend while cunning and artifice vanish.

When the Six Eras neared their end and the Two Sovereigns did not appear, then Taihao Fuxi emerged. At that time, the Great Simplicity dispersed, and human affairs began to sprout—the world first saw action. Observing images, he fashioned tools; knotting cords into nets, he tamed birds and beasts. This was called Fuxi. Smelting metal into cauldrons, transforming raw into cooked, he was also named Paoxi. In that time, birds, beasts, insects, and snakes sheathed their claws and fangs, no longer harming people. Later, when he created writing and rectified human relations, his achievements matched heaven and earth, yet he did not regard them as accomplishments. Thus, he was revered as Taihao—was this not fitting?

Laozi said: If heaven is unsettled, the sun and moon have no place to rest; if earth is unsettled, plants and trees have no place to stand; if the self is not at peace, right and wrong have no form. Thus, only with the true person does true knowledge arise. If what one holds is unclear, how can one know that what I call knowledge is not ignorance?

Accumulating kindness and valuing wealth, making the people joyful and delighting in their lives—this is benevolence. Establishing great deeds, displaying illustrious names, ordering ruler and minister, clarifying superior and inferior, distinguishing close and distant, preserving imperiled states, continuing severed lineages, and establishing heirs for the childless—this is righteousness. Closing the nine orifices, concealing will and intent, discarding wisdom and intelligence, returning to non-discernment, wandering blithely beyond the dust, roaming freely in the realm of no affairs, inhaling yin and exhaling yang to harmonize with the myriad things—this is virtue.

Thus, the Dao disperses into virtue, virtue overflows into benevolence and righteousness, and when benevolence and righteousness are established, the Dao and virtue are abandoned. The Dao and virtue in relation to the Five Constants are like yin and yang in relation to the Five Phases—they are one. Knowing that the sun and moon alternate in brightness, the four seasons proceed in succession, and only then is the year completed—this is understanding the human Dao. The Dao, virtue, and the Five Constants can coexist but cannot be without one another.

Thus, Laozi said: "Abandon sagacity, discard wisdom; abandon benevolence, discard righteousness." Why? Because he detested their names being usurped and enacted falsely. If one truly had the heart to abandon them, then the *Dao* and *De* chapters would not speak of sages or benevolence and righteousness.

Thus, only with the true person does true knowledge arise.

Laozi said: "When the spirit scatters, words become florid; when virtue dissipates, conduct turns false. When the utmost essence radiates within yet speech and action are observed without, this is inevitably to be enslaved by things." When essence is exhausted through sorrow and conduct knows no bounds, what one holds fast to is unstable, and one becomes externally swayed by worldly customs.

Therefore, the sage cultivates the Dao and virtue internally and does not adorn them externally with benevolence and righteousness. Knowing the proper use of the nine orifices and four limbs, they wander in the harmony of spirit—this is the sage’s wandering. The Dao and virtue are the ancestors of the Five Constants; to have ancestors without descendants is impossible. Yet to have descendants while forgetting the ancestors—is this permissible? The Five Constants are the five spirits. When the Dao and virtue reside within, the spirit does not scatter without. Once one loses what they guard, the spirit scatters and words become florid, virtue dissipates and conduct turns false—few escape enslavement by things.

Only the sage, knowing the proper use of the nine orifices and four limbs, wanders in the harmony of spirit—when the ancestor is preserved, how can the descendants not be preserved? Laozi said: "As for the sage’s wandering, they move in perfect emptiness, roam the mind in the Great Void, gallop beyond boundaries, act without gates, listen without sound, see without form, unbound by the world, unshackled by custom." Thus, what the sage uses to move the world is not surpassed by the true person; what the worthy use to correct worldly customs is not observed by the sage.

People bound by worldly customs inevitably have their forms constrained and spirits drained, and thus cannot escape entanglement. If what binds and restrains me must lie in something external, then when the body is not shackled by custom, others will not weary of me. When the mind is not bound by the world, I will not weary of others—this is called wandering with the Creator. Thus, what moves the world is not surpassed by the true person, and what corrects worldly customs is not observed by the sage.

When the will is enslaved by things, the form is constrained and the spirit drained—even the worthy cannot always escape this, let alone the common people. Laozi said: "The ruler’s thoughts do not manifest in the breast, nor does wisdom extend beyond the four quarters. Embracing a heart of benevolence and sincerity, timely sweet rains fall, the five grains flourish, spring births, summer grows, autumn harvests, winter stores. Monthly inspections and seasonal assessments are conducted, and tribute is offered at year’s end. Nurturing the people with impartiality, awe is instilled without admonition, laws are simple and not burdensome, transformation is as if divine, punishments are lenient and prisons empty. The world shares one custom, and none harbor treacherous hearts—this is the sage’s grace.

When superiors covet without measure, inferiors vie for merit without restraint. The people grow poor and bitter, disputes arise, toil yields no reward, cunning and deceit sprout, thieves and bandits multiply, superiors and inferiors resent one another, and decrees go unheeded. When carriages share the same tracks and writing the same script, the world shares one custom. When rewards are not excessive and punishments not cruel, the four seas unite in heart. If this is achieved, the ruler’s thoughts do not extend beyond the four quarters, and transformation is as if divine.

When superiors covet without limit, inferiors vie for merit without restraint. Cunning arises and the people’s strength is depleted; superiors and inferiors resent one another, heaven and earth do not interact, and the myriad things do not communicate. When water is turbid, fish gasp; when governance is harsh, the people rebel. When superiors are full of desires, inferiors grow deceitful; when superiors are restless, inferiors are unsettled; when superiors make many demands, inferiors contend with one another. To neglect the root and seek remedy in the branches is no different from digging channels to stop water or carrying firewood to extinguish fire.

The sage’s affairs are few, their demands for governance minimal yet sufficient. Without acting, they are benevolent; without speaking, they are trusted; without seeking, they obtain; without striving, they accomplish. Embracing naturalness, preserving utmost sincerity, holding to the Dao and extending sincerity, the world follows them as echo responds to sound, as shadow reflects form—what they cultivate is the root. Heaven displays omens to show good and ill fortune, and all see them. The ruler issues commands, clarifies rewards and punishments, and the people all trust them. Is the ruler not like heaven?

When water is turbid, fish gasp; when governance is harsh, the people rebel—this is the inevitable principle. Thus, when superiors are full of desires, the people grow deceitful; when superiors favor stillness, the people do not contend. The sage, holding to the Dao and extending sincerity, is followed by the world—this may be called knowing the root.

Laozi said: "When the spirit scatters without and wisdom dissipates within, governance cannot be achieved. When the use of form and spirit is distant, what is neglected is near. Thus, one who does not step beyond the door knows the world; one who does not peer through the window knows the Dao of heaven. The farther one goes, the less one knows—this speaks of essence and sincerity issuing from within, and spirit and qi moving heaven."

Heaven and earth interact, and the myriad things communicate; the sage arises, and the myriad things behold—this is the Dao of natural resonance. The human heart connects with heaven, for in receiving form and destiny, one’s origin is from heaven itself. Thus, when essence and sincerity issue from within, spirit and qi move heaven. When the human heart is empty and bright, the light of heaven shines forth, like a mirror reflecting form—beauty and ugliness appear of themselves. How can the heart not be guarded?

Laozi said: "The yang of winter’s sun, the yin of summer’s shade—all things return to them without limit. This is the resonance of utmost essence, coming unsummoned, departing without going, profound and obscure, accomplishing its work without one knowing how. To rely on the eyes to see or words to command makes governance difficult. Gaoyao was blind yet served as grand judge, and the world knew no cruel punishments—what need was there for words? Shi Kuang was blind yet served as grand minister, and the state of Jin knew no chaotic governance—what need was there for sight? The command that requires no words, the vision that requires no seeing—this is how the sage serves as teacher.

The burning mirror summons fire, yet without the sun, it does not flame; the square vessel summons water, yet without the moon, it does not flow. Thus, with the Dao but without position, affairs cannot be established."

With position but without the Dao, achievements cannot be realized. When the rulers and ministers of Tang and Yu aligned in the Dao, transformation was perfected and teaching spread; the hundred officials were upright, and the myriad people submitted—this is why the sage serves as teacher for a hundred generations. The people’s transformation by their superiors does not follow their words but follows their conduct.

Thus, when a ruler favors courage, though he does not incite strife, the state will face many calamities, and its gradual decline will inevitably lead to the chaos of robbery and murder. When a ruler favors beauty, though he does not encourage licentious talk, the state will fall into darkness and disorder, and its accumulation will reach the disaster of debauchery and dissipation. Therefore, the sage’s sincerity is distinguished within, and his likes and dislikes are clear without; his words match his feelings, and his commands clarify his intent. Thus, punishments are insufficient to shift customs, and executions are insufficient to suppress villainy—only spiritual transformation is precious. Utmost essence is spirit, and where essence moves, it is like the spring’s vitality or the autumn’s withering.

Thus, the noble person is like an archer: what is a hair’s breadth here is a fathom’s length there. Therefore, those who govern others must be cautious in how they influence them. When the standard is upright, its shadow is straight; when the source is clear, its flow is long—this is the Dao of mutual support between root and branch. Knowing the heart as the root of the body, one knows the ruler as the root of the people. Thus, a ruler’s preferences must not be unprincipled. Favoring courage gives rise to the chaos of robbery and murder; favoring beauty gives rise to the disaster of debauchery and dissipation. Only one who favors virtue distinguishes essence within and clarifies likes and dislikes without. Punishments go unused, yet villainy submits; with the root and foundation secure, the state naturally attains peace.

Laozi said: "When laws are displayed and rewards are set but cannot shift customs, it is because sincerity is not embraced." Thus, hearing its tone, one knows its customs; observing its music, one knows its mores; seeing its mores, one knows its transformation. Those who embrace truth and manifest sincerity move heaven and earth, and their spirit transcends all bounds. Commands are obeyed, and prohibitions are upheld; their Dao is penetrated, and their intent is conveyed. Though they utter not a word, the myriad people of the world, along with birds and beasts, ghosts and spirits, transform with them. Thus, the highest is spiritual transformation; the next is preventing wrongdoing; the lowest is rewarding the worthy and punishing the violent.

A mountain glows when it contains jade; a deep pool charms when it holds pearls—what is within manifests without. Water and stone are wordless, yet people trust them. When a state cherishes its benevolence and sincerity, extends its trustworthiness, punishes without resentment, and rewards without partiality, there is no need to display laws or set rewards, for the people will transform of their own accord. Thus, those who hear of Boyi’s virtue find the stubborn become incorruptible and the weak gain resolve—what words did Boyi speak? His person transformed them.

If words are spoken but not practiced, the people will not follow.

Laozi said: The Great Dao is non-action; non-action means non-possession, and non-possession means non-abiding. One who does not abide dwells in formlessness; one who is formless does not move; one who does not move does not speak. Without speech, there is stillness—soundless and formless. Soundless, it cannot be seen; formless, it cannot be heard. This is called the subtle and wondrous, the supremely spiritual. Vast and unceasing, it is called the root of Heaven and Earth.

The Dao is formless and soundless, so the sage forces it into form, naming the Dao of Heaven and Earth with a single word. The great takes the small as its foundation; the many takes the few as its beginning. The Son of Heaven regards Heaven and Earth as his standard and all things as his resources. His merit and virtue are supreme, his power and renown most noble. The beauty of these two virtues matches Heaven and Earth, so he must follow the Great Dao as the mother of all under Heaven.

Within the realm, there are four great ones: the Dao, Heaven, Earth, and the King. The Dao is non-action, thus enduring; Heaven is wordless, thus lofty and bright; Earth is soundless, thus vast and deep. To embody all three is to be a king. The king is the child of Heaven, the master of Earth, and the parent of the people. Only by lovingly nurturing all things without claiming it as favor does his merit and virtue become supreme, his power and renown most noble—none can surpass him.

Laozi said: Relieving the poor and aiding the distressed gives rise to fame and profit; eliminating harm brings merit to completion. If the world is free from disasters, even sages have no virtue to display; if superiors and inferiors are harmonious, even the worthy have no merit to establish. Thus, the governance of the perfected person embraces virtue and holds to the Dao, extending sincerity and delighting in giving. With boundless wisdom, he rests in silence and does not speak, yet none under Heaven fail to value his wordlessness.

Thus, "The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name." What is inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved into metal and stone, and transmitted to others—these are but its coarse aspects. The Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings differed in their affairs but shared the same heart; they took different paths but reached the same destination. Scholars of later ages, not knowing the unity of the Dao’s embodiment or the essentials of virtue, seize upon the traces of accomplished deeds, kneel and sit to discourse upon them. Though learned and widely informed, they cannot avoid confusion.

Embracing the Dao and holding to virtue, extending sincerity and delighting in giving—this is the Way of those above. Relieving the poor, aiding the distressed, generating profit, and eliminating harm—this is the Way of those in the middle. Seeking victory for oneself without contending for it—this is the Way of those below. Adapting to the times, understanding change and contingency, not bound by office or reclusion, differing in affairs yet sharing the same merit—such a one need not rely on bamboo, silk, metal, or stone to stand as a peer of the ancients.

Laozi said: The essence of the heart can spiritually transform but cannot be spoken of. The sage governs all under Heaven without leaving his seat, his care more urgent than a cry for help. Thus, when words are the same, trust precedes them; when commands are the same, sincerity lies beyond them. When the sage is above, the people are transformed as if by spirit, for emotion precedes them. If he acts above but there is no response below, it is because emotion and command differ.

A three-month-old infant knows not benefit or harm, yet a loving mother’s care for it grows ever deeper—this is emotion. Thus, the function of speech brings change, but the change is small; the function of silence brings change, and the change is great. Trusting a noble person’s words and being loyal to his intent, loyalty and trust take shape within and move responses without—this is the transformation of the worthy and sage.

The *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: Heaven’s nature is human; the human heart is mechanism. Is the ruler not the heart of Heaven and Earth? The heart is the dwelling of spirit and brightness; emotion stirs within, and words issue forth. If good, a response comes from a thousand *li* away; if not good, opposition arises from a thousand *li* away. Thus, when the sage is above, his transformation is like spirit—he governs all under Heaven without leaving his seat.

Laozi said: A son’s death for his father, a minister’s death for his lord—this is not seeking fame by dying, but because a heart of affection is hidden within and does not shirk difficulty. The sorrow of the noble person is not for outward show but arises from within; it is also observed in his conduct. The sage is not ashamed before his shadow; the noble person is cautious in solitude. To abandon the near and seek the distant is to block the way.

Thus, when the sage is above, the people delight in his governance—such were the Two Emperors and Three Kings. When the sage is below, the people long for his intent—such were the mysterious sages and unadorned kings. The people do not forget their desire to benefit others. When a scholar faces danger and offers his life, or stands firm in great integrity and cannot be swayed, it is loyalty and filial piety that make it so.

Like Chang Hong dying for his lord or Shen Sheng dying for his father, a heart of affection is hidden within and does not shirk difficulty—how could this be seeking fame by dying? When the sage is above, the people delight in his governance; when below, they long for his intent.

Laozi said: When a brave warrior cries out, the three armies all retreat—this comes from the sincerity of his utterance. If one sings and none respond, or speaks and none bear it, there must be discord within. To govern all under Heaven without leaving one’s seat is to seek it within oneself. Thus, where persuasion does not reach, bearing does; where bearing does not reach, subtle influence does. Influence arises from the heart and takes form; the utmost essence can be met in form but cannot be awaited in expectation.

Words issue from the mouth, actions arise from the heart—this is the movement of sincerity. Words come from near, actions extend afar—this is the response of sincerity. When a brave warrior cries out, does any in the three armies not retreat? It is the sincerity of his utterance. Like Sunzi’s teaching of warfare, courage arises from sincerity. When he beheaded the king’s beloved concubine, it was because the King of Wu’s words lacked sincerity, and disaster befell his subordinates. For those who hold a state, can their words and deeds not be sincere?

Laozi said: Words have their source, affairs have their root. Losing their source and root, even with many skills, is not as good as speaking little. To harm the multitude, have the master craftsman cut off his finger to show that great skill cannot be forced.

Thus, the wise craftsman does not rely on skill but on timely closure—yet if he does not know when to close, he must bar the door before opening it. Loquacity and busyness are what the sage warns against. Only by honoring the Dao’s root and virtue’s foundation, teaching through action rather than words, can one avoid failure. Handling affairs with non-action ensures no harm. Those swept along by vulgar trends, though skilled in many arts, are enslaved by their own cleverness—how can they not injure their hands? The great craftsman’s work does not depend on cunning; thus, no bolt or bar can keep it shut. Yet one who bars the door before opening it—though the lock be sturdy—will have it sprung when thieves arrive. Where, then, lies the root and foundation?

Laozi said: The sage’s undertakings, though pursued by different paths, converge in the same end. Survival and ruin, stability and collapse, are as one to him, for his resolve never wavers from benefiting others. Thus, the songs of Qin, Chu, Yan, and Wei differ in sound yet all express joy; the laments of the Nine Yi and Eight Di differ in sound yet all convey sorrow. Song is the manifestation of joy, weeping the expression of grief—what stirs within emerges without. It is the impulse that moves them. The sage’s heart, day and night, never forgets its desire to benefit others; the reach of his grace extends far indeed.

The sage is not without desire—he follows what benefits and thereby benefits; the sage is not without action—he acts when it is fitting to act. Different paths, same destination; survival and ruin as one. Diminishing oneself to profit others, never forgetting the world. Though lands differ and customs shift, though speech varies and winds change, human nature remains constant. What stirs within emerges without: joy finds voice in song, sorrow in tears, each response arising from its cause. All are our people—how can they be forgotten? Like the Duke of Zhou, who toiled day and night, sitting vigil until dawn, his resolve unwavering—his grace extended far.

Laozi said: When man governs through non-action, to act is to harm the governance of non-action. To practice non-action is to act without acting; one who cannot act without acting cannot act at all. When man is silent, the spirit speaks—yet to force silence harms the spirit’s silence. To bear silence is to injure the spirit’s numinosity. The body has form; the spirit is formless. Form speaks; the formless is silent. Knowing the mutual arising of being and non-being, the formless does not harm being, nor does being harm the formless. Thus, the sage governs through non-action, neither body harming spirit nor spirit harming body. For wisdom is not numinous—it is what makes the numinous numinous. Thus, the two do not harm each other.

Wenzi said: Reputation can be forcibly established, merit forcibly achieved. Once, Nanrong Chu felt ashamed that the sagely Dao had perished in himself alone. He journeyed south to see Laozi and received a single word of teaching. His spirit awakened, his obstructions dissolved, and though he endured hardship for ten days without eating, it was as though he feasted on the finest meats. Thereby, his clarity illuminated the world, his name endured through later ages, his wisdom spanned heaven and earth, his discernment pierced the finest detail. His praises resounded in elegant speech, ceaseless even now—this is what it means to forcibly establish a name.

Thus, the farmer who does not strive will not fill his granary; the official who does not exert himself will not refine his sincerity; the general and minister who do not press forward will not accomplish great deeds; the king and lord who grow lax will leave no name to posterity.

The Perfected One moves in concealment, like thunder hidden away. He acts in accord with the times, establishes merit through available resources, advances and retreats without difficulty, and penetrates all things without obstruction. Through persistent effort and resolute action, success is achieved as one—was Nanrong Zhao not also one who studied knowing the benefit of action?

Nanrong Chu felt shame that the sagely Way was absent within himself alone, so he entrusted his studies to the gate of Gengsang Chu. Later, he journeyed south to see Laozi and obtained the *Scripture of Nurturing Life*. His clarity illuminated the world, his name endured through later ages—thus, a name can be forcibly established, and merit can be forcibly accomplished.

The sage moves in concealment, acts in accord with the times, and establishes merit through available resources—how could advance and retreat pose any difficulty? The Perfected One refines sincerity within to manifest it outwardly, and his virtue flows to the four directions. Seeing benefit in the world, he rejoices yet does not forget harm; seeing harm, he is startled as if in mourning.

He who shares the people’s sorrows, the people will share his sorrows; he who delights in the people’s joy, the people will delight in his joy. Thus, to sorrow with the world and rejoice with the world—yet fail to become king—has never been known.

The sage’s method begins where it cannot be seen and ends where it cannot be attained. He abides in an unshakable position, accumulates in an inexhaustible storehouse, and bears his charge in an unfailing treasury. His decrees issue forth like the source of flowing water, guiding the people to offices free of contention and opening gates that must be entered.

He does not attempt what cannot be accomplished, does not seek what cannot be obtained, does not dwell where he cannot remain, and does not act where he cannot return. The great man enacts governance that brings delight, and none fail to follow his commands. When commands are followed, one progresses from the small to the great; when commands are defied, good becomes harm, and success becomes failure.

The Perfected One, the sage, and the great man should be distinguished. The Perfected One regards the people as himself, sharing in their benefit and harm. When the people rejoice, he rejoices; when the people sorrow, he sorrows—there has never been one who did not become king.

The sage’s method begins where it cannot be seen and ends where it cannot be attained; now it issues forth like a flowing stream. The great man enacts governance that brings delight, issuing commands in accord with the times. When commands align, the people follow; when they oppose, the people suffer harm.

The so-called great man is inwardly strong and outwardly luminous—his inner strength like heaven and earth, his outer radiance like the sun and moon. Heaven and earth cover and bear all without exception; the sun and moon illuminate all without fail. The great man reveals goodness to others without altering his fundamental nature or changing his constant principles. The world obeys his commands as grass bends to the wind.

When governance falters in spring, Jupiter’s movements expand or contract, no longer abiding in its proper course. When governance falters in summer, Mars retrogrades. When governance falters in autumn, Venus does not appear where it should, its rising and setting erratic. When governance falters in winter, Mercury fails to manifest in its proper region. When governance falters in all four seasons, Saturn sways and trembles, the sun and moon display omens, the five planets move in rebellion, and comets appear.

When spring governance is not lost, millet and grain flourish; when summer governance is not lost, rain falls in season; when autumn governance is not lost, the people prosper; when winter governance is not lost, the state enjoys peace and security.

Humans receive the numinous essence of heaven and earth, and the heart is the abode of spirit and illumination. The great man, however, possesses a spirit even more numinous than others. The slightest movement of his mind—whether toward good or evil—is mirrored by the celestial bell. Thus, the success or failure of governance manifests in portents and omens, responding to affairs without error.

The *Book of Documents* states: “To slight the spirits and oppress the people—August Heaven will not protect such.” Those who hold office—can they not be cautious?

**The Nine Guardians**

Laozi said: Before heaven and earth took form, all was dark and indistinct, merged as one, silent and limpid. The heavy and turbid became earth; the refined and subtle became heaven. They separated into the four seasons, divided into yin and yang. Pure qi formed humans; coarse qi formed creatures. Through the interplay of hardness and softness, the myriad things were born.

Spirit originates from heaven; bones and flesh are rooted in earth. When spirit enters its gate, bones and flesh return to their root—what then remains of me? Thus, the sage models himself on heaven and follows earth, unbound by custom, unenticed by others. He takes heaven as father, earth as mother, yin and yang as his warp, the four seasons as his weft. Heaven is still and clear; earth is settled and tranquil. All things that oppose them perish; those that accord with them live.

Thus, stillness and silence are the abode of spirit and illumination; emptiness and nothingness are where the Dao resides. Spirit is what one receives from heaven and earth; bones and flesh are what one is endowed with from earth.

The Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two give birth to the Three; the Three give birth to the myriad things. The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, blending qi to achieve harmony.

The One is the beginning of form; nine is the completion of numbers. Nine is the ultimate. The sage investigates the nine yet guards the One—then the Dao is within me. The One is the heart; the heart is heaven; heaven is man; man is things; things are the Dao; the Dao is I; I am the beginning. To know the ancient beginning—this is called the discipline of the Dao.

Laozi said: Humans are born through the transformations of heaven and earth. In the first month, the essence congeals; in the second, blood and vessels form; in the third, the embryo takes shape; in the fourth, the fetus develops; in the fifth, the sinews form; in the sixth, the bones harden; in the seventh, the body is complete; in the eighth, it stirs; in the ninth, it becomes restless; in the tenth, it is born. Once the physical form is complete, the five viscera become distinct. The liver governs the eyes; the lungs govern the nose; the spleen governs the tongue; the kidneys govern the ears; the gallbladder governs the mouth. The exterior is the surface; the interior is the core. The head is round, following heaven; the feet are square, resembling earth.

Heaven has the four seasons, five phases, nine luminaries, and three hundred sixty days; humans have four limbs, five viscera, nine orifices, and three hundred sixty joints. Heaven has wind, rain, cold, and heat; humans have taking and giving, joy and anger. The gallbladder corresponds to clouds; the lungs to qi; the spleen to wind; the kidneys to rain; the liver to thunder. Humans resemble heaven and earth, and the heart governs them all. The ears and eyes are the sun and moon; blood and qi are wind and rain. When the sun and moon lose their course, they dim and eclipse; when wind and rain come unseasonably, they destroy and bring disaster. When the five stars lose their course, states and lands suffer calamity.

The beginning of things lies in the One, from which all arises. Through transformation, the myriad things are born. Father heaven and mother earth, yin and yang unite, conceiving and nurturing life. Impure qi forms creatures; pure qi forms humans. Thus, heaven, earth, and the myriad things are all contained within my body.

Opening and closing, giving and taking—such is the Way of heaven. To oppose it is to die; to follow it is to live. The Way of heaven and earth is vast and great, yet it still moderates its brilliance and cherishes its spirit and illumination. How then can human ears and eyes endure constant stimulation without rest? How can spirit gallop without exhaustion? Thus, the sage guards the inner and does not lose the outer.

Blood and qi are the glory of humans; the five viscera are their essence. When blood and qi concentrate within and do not stray outward, the chest and abdomen are full, and desires are few. With few desires, the ears and eyes are clear, hearing and vision sharp—this is called illumination. When the five viscera are aligned with the heart and do not depart, qi and intent prevail, conduct is upright, spirit flourishes, and qi does not scatter. Thus, one hears all, sees all, accomplishes all, and no misfortune or calamity can enter, nor can evil qi assail.

Therefore, those who seek much gain little; those who see broadly know little. Heaven’s creation of things: what does not move grows like a plant; what moves crawls horizontally; what is planted stands upright. Humans combine the functions of both movement and stillness—thus they are more numinous than the myriad things. The four limbs, the hundred parts, spirit, blood, and qi—how can one not cherish them? How can one seek excessively?

Kings, dukes, and great officials, entrusted with the world, must also encompass humanity and all things, loving and nurturing them as they do their own bodies—only then is the Dao fulfilled. The orifices are the doors and windows of spirit; blood and qi are the messengers and sentinels of the five viscera. Thus, when the ears and eyes indulge in sounds and sights, the five viscera become agitated and unsettled, blood and qi surge and do not rest, spirit gallops and does not guard. Though fortune and misfortune come like mountains, one cannot recognize them.

Thus, the sage cherishes without excess. If the sage’s ears, eyes, and spirit are profoundly penetrating, unenticed by external allure, and if his intent and qi do not lose their clarity, with few desires, the five viscera are at peace. When spirit guards within and does not stray from the body, one can observe beyond past ages, within future affairs, and between fortune and misfortune—all becomes clearly visible. Therefore, the farther one strays, the less one knows. This is to say that spirit must not be allowed to indulge externally.

Thus, the five colors confuse the eyes, making them unclear; the five sounds enter the ears, making them dull; the five flavors disorder the mouth, causing sores; preferences and aversions disturb the heart, making conduct reckless. Desires make human qi excessive; likes and dislikes exhaust human essence. If one does not swiftly cast them aside, intent and qi will daily diminish. Though the Yellow River is vast, wind and sun deplete it. Though spirit may be sovereign, worldly desires disturb it.

Nothing escapes this diminishing. The sage, profoundly penetrating, is free from allure and longing. Spirit is firmly secured within, while the body remains at ease externally. The chamber of the heart is empty and void, and the numinous comes to dwell therein. Beyond past ages and before future affairs, nothing is not illuminated—all due to the heart’s emptiness.

The Way of nurturing life is no other than this: its method is like tending a horse—simply remove what harms it. The reason people cannot fulfill their natural lifespan is their excessive indulgence in the pursuit of life. Only one who takes no thought for life thereby attains long life.

Heaven and earth move in mutual resonance; the myriad things are gathered into one. To know the One is to know all things; to fail to know the One is to know nothing. I dwell in the world as but one thing among things—yet things are also things. How can one thing assess another?

The desire for life cannot be served; the aversion to death cannot be refused. To despise lowliness cannot be hated; to delight in honor cannot be rejoiced. Following one’s endowment and settling into stillness, daring not to go to extremes—daring not to go to extremes, one reaches the utmost joy.

Some things arise without being made, sought, or nurtured—this is Heaven. Those that must be made, sought, and nurtured belong to man. If man errs by harboring the intent to make or seek, it is like forcing the sprouts to grow, only to bring harm, injuring life and losing nurture, failing to fulfill the natural lifespan.

The sage, resonant with Heaven and earth, is one with things. He does not augment life nor reject death; he scorns lowliness yet does not hate it, honors nobility yet does not rejoice. Following his endowment and settling into stillness, daring not to go to extremes, he reaches the utmost joy.

**Guarding Emptiness**
Laozi said: The so-called sage adapts to the times and rests content in his place, engaging with the world and delighting in his work. Grief and joy are deviations of virtue; likes and dislikes are burdens of the heart; delight and anger are excesses of the Dao. In life, he moves with Heaven’s course; in death, he transforms with things. At rest, he harmonizes with yin’s power; in motion, he flows with yang’s current. Thus, the heart is the master of the body, and spirit is the heart’s treasure. If the body labors without rest, it withers; if essence is expended without cease, it is exhausted. Therefore, the sage follows this without daring to transgress.

Responding to being with non-being, he exhausts its principles; receiving the full with the empty, he fathoms its limits. Serene, joyful, empty, and still, he fulfills his destiny. Neither distant nor close, he embraces virtue and kindles harmony, aligning with Heaven. He borders the Dao and neighbors virtue, neither initiating fortune nor preceding misfortune. Death and life bring no change to him—this is called utmost spirit. With spirit, one seeks and obtains all, accomplishes all. The sage empties himself to wander the world, moves with Heaven, and acts in accord with the times. Neither profit nor harm sways his heart; neither death nor life alters him. Receiving the full with the empty, he embraces virtue and kindles harmony. Misfortune does not precede him; fortune does not initiate with him. When affairs arise, he responds like an echo—divinely. When the response ceases, he is still. This is called guarding emptiness.

**Guarding the Undivided**
Laozi said: To regard the world as light is to keep spirit unburdened; to see the myriad things as minute is to keep the heart unconfused. To equalize life and death is to keep the will unafraid; to harmonize with change is to keep names from dazzling. The perfected man leans on an unshakable pillar, walks an unobstructed path, draws from an inexhaustible store, and learns from an undying teacher. Wherever he goes, he succeeds; wherever he turns, he penetrates. Whether bending or stretching, bowing or rising, he holds fast to destiny without confusion, turning through fortune and misfortune. Profit and harm cannot trouble his heart.

One who acts with righteousness may be pressed with benevolence but cannot be coerced with arms; he may be guided with righteousness but cannot be lured with profit. The noble man dies for righteousness—he cannot be detained by wealth or honor. He acts for righteousness and cannot be frightened by death—how much more so for one who practices non-action? One who practices non-action is without burden. The unburdened man takes the world as his shadow and pillar. Looking up to the ranks of the perfected, deeply probing the intent of the Dao and virtue, and examining the conduct of the vulgar below—this is truly shameful.

One who takes no thought for the world is like striking a drum to summon learning. Non-being gives rise to being, yet being is not without non-being. When being perishes, it returns to non-being. Being cannot exist without non-being; non-being is the root of being, yet being cannot sustain itself. To know the benefit of non-being and the use of being is to know that non-being is not nothingness—where nothingness is not nothing, there is the Dao. Being does not endure forever; what does not endure forever is a thing. Thus, the sage is rich without possessing, poor without lacking. Equalizing self and others, unifying life and death, he is not burdened in spirit. What does not perish in the self resides here—this is called guarding the undivided.

**Guarding Equanimity**
Laozi said: Esteem and wealth are what men covet, yet compared to the body, they are base. Therefore, the sage eats enough to fill the belly and replenish qi, wears enough to cover the body and ward off cold. He satisfies his nature and rejects excess, neither coveting gain nor hoarding abundance. His eyes do not gaze, his ears do not listen, his mouth does not speak, his heart does not scheme. He discards cleverness and returns to simplicity, rests his spirit, and abandons cunning. Without preferences or aversions, this is called great penetration.

To remove filth and cast off burdens, nothing surpasses never having departed from the source. What could then not be accomplished? One who knows the harmony of nurturing life cannot be lured by profit; one who unites inner and outer signs cannot be tempted by power. The outer limit of the outer is vast; the inner limit of the inner is most noble. To know the great and noble—where could one not succeed?

The Dao values guarding; with guarding, there is accomplishment. The heart values equanimity; with equanimity, there is no tilting. The world’s esteem and wealth are what all men covet. Covetousness gives rise to an unbalanced heart—this is not the Way of guarding. Thus, the sage eats to fill his belly, wears enough to cover his body, and harbors no greed for excess accumulation.

Thus, with a heart at peace and qi settled, the spirit does not stray outward—this accords with the great constancy of the Dao and is called "guarding equilibrium."

**Guarding the Easy (4)**
Laozi said: Those of old who embodied the Dao ordered their emotions and nature, cultivated their heart’s arts, nurtured them with harmony, and maintained them with moderation. They delighted in the Dao and forgot lowliness; their inner power was secure, and they forgot poverty. If nature has no desires, there is nothing unattainable through desirelessness; if the heart has no joys, there is nothing unachievable through joylessness. What harms nature is not allowed to burden virtue; what disrupts life is not permitted to disturb harmony. They did not indulge the body or follow whim, yet their institutions could serve as models for the world. They ate according to their stomach’s measure, clothed themselves according to their form’s needs, dwelled where their body fit, and acted according to their nature’s inclination. They left the world’s surplus without claiming it and entrusted the myriad things without seeking profit—how could poverty or wealth, nobility or baseness cause them to lose their nature and life? Those who do so may be said to have embodied the Dao.

"Much ease brings many difficulties"—this speaks of affairs. But in terms of the Dao, it is not so. Those of old who embodied the Dao cultivated their heart and nature, made their bodies at ease before acting, settled their intentions before moving, delighted in the Dao and rested in constancy, and did not attempt what was difficult or extraordinary. Thus, their institutions had laws, their bearing was observable, and they acted with composure—this is called "guarding the easy."

**Guarding Purity (5)**
Laozi said: Humans receive qi from Heaven, and their ears and eyes respond to sounds and sights, their nose and mouth to fragrances and odors, their hungry skin to cold and warmth—all share the same nature. Yet some die, some live; some become noble, some base. The difference lies in how they are governed.

The spirit is the wellspring of wisdom; when the spirit is clear, wisdom is bright. Wisdom is the storehouse of the heart; when wisdom is impartial, the heart is at peace. No one mirrors themselves in flowing water but in still water, for it is clear and tranquil. Thus, when the spirit is clear and the intent is calm, one can perceive the true nature of things. Those who employ this must borrow from non-employment. A bright mirror is not sullied by dust and grime; a clear spirit is not misled by cravings. Wherever the heart reaches, the spirit is luminously present; returning to emptiness, agitation dissipates and rest is stored—this is the wandering of the sage.

Thus, those who govern the world must first comprehend the nature of life and destiny. Water is clear and mirrors things; the spirit is clear and perceives the Dao. Humans receive qi from Heaven in the same way, so why should my perception of the Dao in the heart be uniquely different? Because the heart is clear. The sage’s heart is bright as still water: when things come, they are seen; when they depart, it returns to stillness—how could anything linger in my heart? A clear mirror is unperturbed—this is called "guarding purity."

**Guarding Authenticity (6)**
Laozi said: The so-called sage simply accords with nature: eating according to the stomach’s measure, clothing according to the body’s form, restraining the self so that greedy and corrupt thoughts have no way to arise. Thus, those who can possess the world must not treat the world as their possession; those who can attain fame and reputation must not seek it through transgressive conduct. Truly comprehending the nature of life and destiny, benevolence and righteousness naturally adhere.

If the spirit is unobscured and the heart unburdened, all is penetrating and unimpeded, serene and untroubled—power and profit cannot lure, sounds and sights cannot seduce, eloquence cannot persuade, cunning cannot move, and bravery cannot frighten. This is the wandering of the true person. Those who give life do not live; those who transform do not change. Those who do not grasp this Dao, though their wisdom governs heaven and earth, their brilliance illuminates the sun and moon, their eloquence unravels linked rings, and their words moisten metal and stone, are still of no benefit in governing the world. Thus, the sage does not lose what they guard.

The sage follows nature, guards utmost authenticity, aligns with the times, and understands the hearts of the people. Only by not opposing the nature of the myriad things can the heart congeal and the form dissolve, becoming pure and unceasing—this is called "guarding authenticity."

**Guarding Stillness (7)**
Laozi said: Stillness, silence, tranquility, and simplicity nurture life; harmony, joy, emptiness, and nothingness uphold virtue. When the outer does not disturb the inner, nature attains its proper place; when stillness is unmoving and harmony is settled, virtue rests in its position. Nurturing life to order the world and embracing virtue to live out one’s years—this may be called embodying the Dao.

Those who do so have unobstructed blood and qi, no stagnant qi in the five viscera, and are neither warped by fortune nor sullied by fame or blame. Without possessing the world, who could aid them? Having talent but not meeting the times, one cannot even free oneself—how much less without the Dao?

Those who see the tip of an autumn hair cannot hear the sound of thunder; those who tune their ears to the sounds of gold and jade cannot see the shape of Mount Tai. Thus, a small focus causes one to forget the great. Now, when the myriad things come, they snatch at our nature and seize our essence like a spring’s source—though one may wish not to receive them, how is it possible?

If a basin of water is clear, one can see their eyebrows after a day; if it is muddied by a single stir, one cannot discern its shape. The human spirit is difficult to keep clear and easy to muddy, like a basin of water. The Dao of heaven and earth is still, so things grow without being forced; the sage’s governance is still, so the people are naturally capable. If one harbors a mind to seek merit and stir up affairs, disturbing nature and disordering heaven’s constancy, stillness is lost and movement is confused.

Only by not pursuing strange changes is this called "guarding stillness."

**Guarding the Law (8)**
Laozi said: The highest sage models Heaven; the next esteems worthies; the lowest employs ministers. Employing ministers is the path to peril and ruin; esteeming worthies is the source of delusion and confusion; modeling Heaven is the Dao of governing heaven and earth.

Emptiness and stillness are the foundation: emptiness receives all, stillness sustains all. Knowing the Dao of emptiness and stillness, one can endure from beginning to end. Thus, the sage takes stillness as governance and movement as disorder. Therefore it is said: Do not disturb or agitate, and the myriad things will clarify themselves; do not startle or alarm, and the myriad things will order themselves—this is the Dao of Heaven.

The highest sage models Heaven, and the hundred bones are ordered, the myriad transformations at peace. The next esteems worthies, and the law proceeds from the self—this is the source of delusion. The lowest employs ministers, and the law emerges from the mouths of the many—this is the omen of peril and ruin. Cultivating the self without the Dao is to be deluded in affairs and lose one’s spirit; governing the state without the Dao is to disorder policy and harm the people. Only taking the embodiment of the Dao as the foundation is this called "guarding the Law."

**Guarding Weakness (9)**
Laozi said: The Son of Heaven and the feudal lords take the world or the state as their household, regard the myriad things as their livestock, embrace the vastness of all under Heaven, and possess the abundance of the ten thousand things. Yet when their qi is replete and their ambitions arrogant, the great use troops to invade the small, the small grow insolent and overbear their superiors, and their hearts indulge in extravagance and excess—this is like whirlwinds and violent rains, which cannot endure for long. Therefore the sage governs with the Dao, holds to the One and practices non-action, without harming the primal qi. Perceiving the small and guarding softness, withdrawing and possessing nothing, modeling the rivers and seas, the rivers and seas do not act—thus merit and fame transform themselves. Not forcing, one can complete one’s kingship; acting as the female of all under Heaven, one’s spirit does not die. Self-cherishing completes one’s nobility. With the power of ten thousand chariots and the ten thousand things as one’s merit and fame, the burden of authority is most weighty—one cannot treat oneself lightly. Treating oneself lightly, merit and fame will not be achieved.

The Dao is great yet accomplished through the small, abundant yet ruled by the few. Thus the sage governs all under Heaven with the Dao. That which is soft, weak, subtle, and mysterious perceives the small; that which is frugal, sparing, diminished, and deficient perceives the few. Perceiving the small, one can complete the great; perceiving the few, one can complete the beautiful. Weakness is the function of the Dao, not cowardice—it is but guarding the harmonious and balanced. The Son of Heaven takes all under Heaven as his household; the feudal lords take their states as their households. Regarding the people as oneself, not relying on power and position to assert strength, not using arms to oppress the multitude—if distant peoples do not submit, then cultivate civil virtue to attract them. Great resources complete the small and become abundant; supporting the few as the foundation, advancing without harm, one attains peace and tranquility—this is called "guarding weakness."

The Way of Heaven suppresses the high and elevates the low, diminishes excess and supplements insufficiency. The rivers and seas occupy the lowest places, thus all under Heaven returns to and serves them. Therefore the sage, humble, modest, pure, and yielding, perceives lowness; emptying the heart of all, perceives insufficiency. Perceiving lowness, one can attain loftiness; perceiving insufficiency, one can complete one’s worthiness. Those who are haughty do not stand; those who are extravagant do not endure; the strong and overbearing perish; the overflowing and full are ruined. Whirlwinds and violent rains do not last the day; small valleys cannot remain full for even a moment. Whirlwinds and torrential rains carry the qi of strength and overbearing, thus they cannot last and perish; small valleys occupy the place of strength and overbearing, thus they cannot but be seized.

Therefore the sage holds to the female and the yielding, abandons arrogance and extravagance, and dares not act with the qi of strength and overbearing. Holding to the female and the yielding, one can establish one’s maleness and virility; not daring arrogance and extravagance, one can endure long. The Way of Heaven diminishes excess and supplements insufficiency, detests fullness and favors modesty. Those who rely on force become hegemons; those who rely on virtue become kings. The weak overcomes the strong.

When people impose harsh governance and oppress the people, it is like Heaven’s violent winds breaking trees—primordial qi vents its wrath, and strength cannot endure long. Thus the sage is humble and lowly, guarding only weakness.

Laozi said: The Way of Heaven reaches its extreme and then reverses; when full, it diminishes—this is seen in the sun and moon. Therefore the sage daily diminishes, and the primal qi does not dare become full; daily advancing with the female, his merit and power do not decline—this is the Way of Heaven.

Human nature and emotions all favor the high and detest the low, favor gain and detest loss, favor profit and detest harm, favor honor and detest humility, favor nobility and detest baseness. The multitude acts accordingly, thus cannot succeed; clinging to these, thus cannot attain. Therefore the sage models Heaven: not acting yet accomplishing, not grasping yet attaining. Sharing human emotions yet following a different path, he can endure long.

Thus the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had vessels of warning, called the *yòuzhī*. When empty, it stands upright; when full, it overturns. Things flourish and then decline; the sun at its zenith moves on; the moon at its full wanes; joy ends in sorrow. Therefore, those with keen hearing and broad wisdom guard with foolishness; those with extensive learning and eloquence guard with restraint; those with martial strength and courage guard with awe; those with wealth and vastness guard with narrowness; those whose virtue extends to all under Heaven guard with yielding. These five are how the former kings guarded all under Heaven. Those who follow this Dao do not desire fullness, thus can wear out without renewal.

The Dao reaches its extreme and then reverses; things flourish and then decline—this is the constant principle. The *zhī* vessel full then overturns; the blade hard then snaps—this is the constant of things. If one can observe the constant principles of things and not rely on power to oppress the multitude and assert strength, then one avoids the harm of stumbling and falling. Preserving softness and weakness, one can endure long.

Laozi said: The sage closes with yin and opens with yang, able to reach the state of no joy—thus there is nothing not joyful. Being without anything not joyful is to reach ultimate joy. Therefore, inner joy is external, not external joy within. Thus there is self-joy, and having this attainment, one is honored throughout all under Heaven. The reason for this is taking all under Heaven as the essential for all under Heaven, not residing in that, but in the self; not in others, but in one’s own person. When the person attains, the ten thousand things are complete.

Thus one who has mastered the discourse on the arts of the heart is external to desires, likes, and aversions. Therefore, there is nothing to delight in, nothing to anger, nothing to rejoice in, nothing to suffer. The myriad things are profoundly united, without right or wrong. Thus the scholar has a constant discourse; the woman has unchanging conduct. Not relying on power to be honored, not needing wealth to be rich, not requiring force to be strong, not valuing goods and wealth, not coveting worldly fame, not taking nobility as security, not taking baseness as peril—form, spirit, qi, and will each reside in their proper place.

When Heaven is about to rain, the pillars’ bases first moisten...

When spring is near, the ice thaws first; when a man is about to die, his tongue stiffens first—qi effects this. The soft and weak belong to the realm of life; the hard and strong belong to the realm of death. Those who are violent and unyielding yet do not meet their end are the most extreme of the violent and unyielding. Only when qi and form are harmonious and weak, merging with things in profound unity and growing together without harm, does one approach the Way.

The form is the dwelling of life; qi is the origin of life; spirit is the regulator of life. If any one of these loses its proper place, all three are injured. Thus, when spirit presides, form follows and benefits; when form presides, spirit follows and suffers. The greedy and covetous, blinded by power and profit, lured by fame and rank, strive with excessive cunning to rise above others in the world. Their essence and spirit daily wane and drift far away; long immersed and unable to return, their form becomes closed and resistant, leaving no path for entry. Thus they often suffer blindness, forgetfulness, and self-loss.

Essence, spirit, will, and qi—when still, they daily grow and strengthen; when restless, they daily deplete and age. Therefore, the sage nurtures their spirit, harmonizes and softens their qi, levels their form, and drifts with the Dao. In this way, the transformations of the myriad things all find their counterpart, and the changes of a hundred affairs all meet their response.

Spirit depends on form to live; essence depends on qi to flourish. Nurturing one another without losing harmony—this is the essence of cultivating life. But those who are empty and arrogant, relying on qi to contend with things, will deplete their essence and exhaust their spirit, often suffering blindness and forgetfulness—signs of approaching death.

Thus the sage weakens their form, harmonizes their qi, and conceals their spirit, attaining the Way of the Nine Guardians. Does the sage deceive us? To aspire to sagehood is to become a sage; to aspire to worthiness is to become worthy.

In guarding simplicity, Laozi said: The so-called True Person is one whose nature aligns with the Dao. Thus, they have yet seem without; are full yet seem empty. They govern their inner self, not their outer self, clarifying the Great Simplicity. They act without contrivance and return to simplicity, embracing their origin and holding fast to spirit, roaming the root of Heaven and Earth. Vague and drifting beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the work of non-action, they carry no schemes or cunning in their hearts. Discerning the unborrowed, they do not shift with things. Perceiving the transformations of affairs, they hold to their source. Their mind and intent focus inward, comprehending fortune and misfortune as one. Abiding without knowing what they do, moving without knowing where they go, they know without learning, see without looking, accomplish without acting, and distinguish without governing.

They respond to stimuli, move under compulsion, and go when there is no choice—like light fearing darkness, like a shadow following form. Following the Dao as their guide, they act when conditions are met. Vast and empty, clear and still, they take the thousand lives as one transformation, the ten thousand differences as one source. They possess essence yet do not employ it; possess spirit yet do not use it. They guard the simplicity of the Great Undifferentiated, standing at the center of utmost purity. Their sleep is dreamless, their wisdom unaroused. In movement, they leave no form; in stillness, no substance. Existing yet seeming absent, living yet seeming dead, they enter and exit without gap, commanding ghosts and spirits.

This is how essence and spirit ascend to the Dao: by ensuring their free flow without losing their origin, day and night without interruption, harmonizing with things like spring. This is to unite and give birth to the seasons within the heart. Thus, though the form may decay, the spirit never transforms. Responding to change without changing, through a thousand shifts and ten thousand turns, it remains without limit. The changing return to formlessness; the unchanging are born with Heaven and Earth. Therefore, that which gives life has never truly lived; what it gives life to is but life’s transformation. The transforming has never truly transformed; what it transforms is but transformation.

This is the wandering of the True Person, the pure Dao. The True Person guards the simplicity of the Great Undifferentiated, roams the root of Heaven and Earth, and merges with the Great Thoroughfare—vast and without trace. Only by not possessing a self do they not lack things. They laugh when others laugh, weep when others weep, yet through a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, they never reach an end. The changing return to formlessness, yet there is change without change. The unchanging are born with Heaven and Earth, yet there is life without life.

The Nine Guardians of before and the guarding of simplicity that follows—these are one becoming nine, and ten returning to one. This is called roaming with the Creator. *The Thoroughly Illuminated True Classic, with Collected Explanations, Scroll Three* ends here.

**The Chapter of Tally-Words**

Laozi said: The Dao is supremely high, without above; supremely deep, without below. Level as the water-level, straight as the marking-line, round as the compass, square as the carpenter’s square. It enfolds Heaven and Earth yet has no inside or outside; it penetrates and covers all yet encounters no obstruction. Thus, one who embodies the Dao is neither angered nor delighted. Seated, they are without care; asleep, they dream not. They name things as they appear and respond to affairs as they arise.

Tallies manifest trust; words convey sincerity. The world speaks of tally-mandates, tally-seals, golden tallies, and jade tallies—all serve to manifest trust and convey sincerity, so that this evokes and that responds. Hence, they are called *tally-words*.

The Dao is without limit in height or depth, connecting far and near. It is formless and nameless, yet possesses sentiment and trust.

The sage embodies the Dao, harboring no private joy or anger. They name things as they appear and respond to affairs as they arise. Unspoken words may yet serve as tally and trust.

Laozi said: Those who covet fame must create affairs. Once affairs arise, they abandon the public and pursue the private, forsake the Dao and rely on themselves. They perform good deeds for praise and establish virtue for renown. Thus, governance does not follow principle, and affairs do not accord with the times. Governance that does not follow principle invites much blame; affairs that do not accord with the times yield no merit. Acting recklessly to meet expectations, success cannot absolve their blame, while failure is enough to destroy them. Fame is the instrument of self-destruction—what the sage guards against.

Those who covet fame must violate Heaven and defy the Dao, abandon the public and pursue the private, seek praise and establish renown, creating affairs to harm the multitude. Thus, governance does not follow principle, merit cannot outweigh blame, affairs fail and destroy the self—this is no falsehood.

Laozi said: Be not the corpse of fame, the storehouse of schemes, the bearer of tasks, or the master of cunning. Conceal yourself in formlessness, act without negligence. Be not the first to seek fortune, nor the initiator of misfortune. Begin in formlessness, move only when unavoidable. Desire fortune? First distance misfortune. Desire benefit? First avoid harm.

Thus, those who act yet seek tranquility—if they lose their tranquility, they court danger. Those who govern—if they lose their governance, they invite chaos. Therefore, desire not to be as jade, restless and polished; nor as stone, solitary and unyielding.

The finer the grain, the sooner the skin is flayed; the finer the antlers, the sooner the body is slain. Sweet springs must run dry; straight trees must be felled. Florid words later become transgressions; jade within stone harms the mountain. The calamities of the black-headed people surely precede their words.

The retribution of good and evil follows like shadow after form. Good deeds summon blessings; evil deeds summon misfortune. Evil must not be done—how then can fame be coveted?

Those who seek tranquility—if tranquility is lost, danger follows. Those who seek governance—if governance is lost, chaos ensues. Fine grain invites flaying; fine antlers invite slaughter. Never has harm come that was not self-invited.

Laozi said: When the times move, act in accord. Those who do not know the Dao mistake fortune for misfortune. Heaven is the canopy; Earth, the carriage-pole. Those who skillfully employ the Dao never meet their end. Earth is the carriage-wheel; Heaven, the canopy. Those who skillfully employ the Dao never suffer harm.

When the five phases are arrayed, there must be conquest. All beneath Heaven’s cover is fitting. Thus, to know yet claim ignorance is sickness; to be ignorant yet claim knowledge is also sickness.

Heaven as canopy covers all; Earth as carriage bears all. Heaven and Earth’s grace toward humanity is boundlessly great. The sage emulates this: acting in accord with the times, every movement follows. Like the five phases, they mutually generate and mutually conquer.

Those who skillfully employ the Dao know without speaking of knowledge—this is superior. To be ignorant yet speak of knowledge is sickness.

Laozi said: Mountains give birth to metal; stone gives birth to jade. They turn and flay one another. Trees give birth to insects, which return to devour them. Humans create affairs, which return to harm them.

Those who love affairs are never without misfortune; those who contend for profit are never without exhaustion. Skilled swimmers drown; skilled riders fall. Each suffers calamity through what they love.

Success lies in timing, not in contention; governance lies in the Dao, not in sagacity. Earth abides below and does not contend for height—thus it is secure and never imperiled. Water flows downward and does not contend for speed—thus it departs yet is never late.

Therefore, the sage, being without attachment, suffers no loss; being without action, meets no defeat. Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things mutually steal to nourish one another. When theft is fitting, there is peace; when theft is unfitting, there is harm.

Thus, food can nourish humans, yet also harm them. The people can support their lord, yet also rebel against him. When scholars establish laws and initiate affairs to exploit the people’s strength, it may seem beneficial at first, but in the end, none do not harm themselves.

Know that success lies in timing, not in contention; governance lies in the Dao, not in sagacity—then there will be no loss from mutual theft.

Laozi said: One word cannot be exhausted; two words are the ancestral teaching of the world. Three words make the lords of states mighty; four words make the world balanced.

Integrity and trust cannot be exhausted. Virtue and the Dao are the world’s ancestral teaching. Exalting the worthy and virtuous makes the lords of states mighty. Loathing the few and loving the many makes the world balanced.

Few faults in speech, few regrets in conduct—this lies in action, not in words. Holding the great image, the world comes to you—this lies in virtue, not in peril.

The mouth alone gives rise to good and incites strife—how can words not be cautious?

Laozi said: Humans face three deaths, none of which are fated. Immoderate eating and drinking, despising and degrading the body—illness kills them together. Insatiable in pleasure, unceasing in desire—punishment kills them together.

With few to confront the many, with weak to oppress the strong—warfare kills them together.

Life must end in death; who can escape it? To die without fate is truly pitiable.

Gluttony and lust bring death by illness,
Greed for gain brings death by punishment,
Tyranny brings death by war.

Though these three deaths differ in cause, their lack of fate is one.

Laozi said:
To those who give generously, their reward is splendid;
To those who harbor great grudges, their calamity runs deep.
To give little yet expect much,
To hoard resentment yet claim no misfortune—
Such things have never existed.

Observe how they go, and you shall know how they came.
The principle of giving and receiving is like planting melons and gathering melons,
Planting fruit and gathering fruit.
The law of gratitude and resentment is the same.

Laozi said:
To fathom Heaven’s decree,
To cultivate the mind’s method,
To regulate affection and aversion,
To harmonize nature and disposition—
Then the Way of governance is complete.

To fathom Heaven’s decree is to not be perplexed by fortune and misfortune;
To cultivate the mind’s method is to not indulge in false joy or anger;
To regulate affection and aversion is to not covet what is useless;
To harmonize nature and disposition is to let desire not exceed proper measure.
Not to be perplexed by fortune and misfortune means action and stillness follow natural order;
Not to indulge in false joy or anger means rewards and punishments are impartially given;
Not to covet what is useless means desire does not harm innate nature;
To let desire not exceed proper measure means nurturing life through contentment.

These four principles require no external seeking, no reliance on others—
They are attained by turning inward.

Heaven’s decree, the mind’s method, affection and aversion, nature and disposition—
These four are interlinked, like the moon reflected in water,
Its waxing and waning, roundness and absence, mirroring its form.

The rectitude or perversity of the mind’s method determines fortune and misfortune.

Laozi said:
Do not seek actions that invite censure,
Do not resent others’ disapproval of you.
Cultivate virtue that earns praise,
Do not seek praise for yourself.
You cannot ensure misfortune will not come—trust that you do not court it,
Nor can you ensure fortune will arrive—trust that you do not reject it.
When misfortune comes, it is not of your making, so even in adversity, you need not grieve;
When fortune arrives, it is not of your doing, so even in prosperity, you need not boast.

Thus, in quietude you find joy,
In non-action you govern.
Trust yourself—what need for seeking?
Resent not others—what need for aversion?
Virtue and conduct stem from yourself; praise and blame come from others.
Thus, praise does not spur you to greater effort,
Nor does criticism deter you.
You dwell in quietude and take joy,
Governance is not a burden to you.

Laozi said:
The Dao is to hold fast to what you already possess,
Not to seek what you do not yet have.
To seek what you do not yet have is to lose what you already possess;
To follow what you already possess is to attain what you desire.

Governance not yet secured against disorder will inevitably falter;
Actions not yet free of fault will inevitably meet setback.
Thus, no greater fortune than avoiding misfortune,
No greater benefit than avoiding loss.

The Dao cannot be pursued to gain advantage,
But it can bring tranquility and avert harm.
Thus, one may always avoid misfortune but not always attain fortune,
Always avoid guilt but not always earn merit.

The Dao is vast and obscure,
Following Heaven’s might,
Aligning with Heaven’s qi,
Without scheming or planning,
Without storing or hoarding.
To welcome without inviting,
To send without bidding farewell—
Though people move east, west, south, or north,
They stand firm at the center.
Thus, amid crookedness, you remain straight,
Flowing with the world yet never straying from your path.
You neither seek goodness nor shun ugliness,
Following Heaven’s Way without initiation,
Without self-aggrandizement,
Following Heaven’s principle without premeditation,
Without neglecting the times,
Aligning with Heaven’s timing,
Without seeking gain,
Without rejecting fortune,
Conforming to Heaven’s decree.

Within, no extraordinary fortune;
Without, no extraordinary misfortune.
Thus, misfortune and fortune do not arise,
And who would dare harm others?

Therefore, supreme virtue speaks of shared paths,
Acts in shared fortune,
Unites hearts above and below,
With no divergent ways.
Those with peripheral visions are dismissed from error,
The path to goodness is opened,
And the people turn toward rectitude.

Greed for gain and forgetfulness of loss—
A common affliction among all.
Without desire, there is tranquility—
This is called the Perfect Person.

In the world, there are things that cannot be guaranteed.
To hold fast to what you possess may bring what you lack;
To seek what you lack may lose what you possess.
Thus, those who follow the Dao
Have no extraordinary fortune within,
No extraordinary misfortune without,
And align with Heaven—
Who could harm them?

Laozi said:
To do good is to encourage,
To do evil is to invite observation.
Encouragement brings nobility,
Observation brings calamity.
Thus, the Dao cannot be pursued to seek fame,
But it can be cultivated in retreat to refine oneself.

Therefore, the sage does not seek fame through action,
Nor reputation through knowledge.
Governance follows naturally,
And the self remains unburdened.

What is done may fail,
What is sought may not be attained,
And people may falter while the Dao remains unobstructed.

To have wisdom yet do nothing is the same as having no wisdom;
To have ability yet act not is the same as having no ability.
To have wisdom as though without wisdom,
To have ability as though without ability—
When the Dao is fully understood, human talent is extinguished.

Human understanding and the Dao cannot both flourish;
If people love fame, they will not use the Dao.
When the Dao surpasses humanity, fame fades,
And when fame flourishes, the Dao is obscured—
Then peril and ruin follow.

To do good without seeking fortune yet fortune comes,
To do evil without inviting misfortune yet misfortune arises.
To leave a stench for ten thousand generations,
Or a fragrant name for a thousand years—
The difference is clear.

Thus, if one values fame excessively,
The mind will not adhere to the Dao;
If one delves deeply into the Dao,
The body will not seek fame.
This is the distinction between Heaven and humanity.

Laozi said:
To let honest men divide wealth is not as fair as
Setting fixed portions and casting lots—
For those with intent in division
Are not as impartial as those without intent.

To let virtuous men guard wealth is not as secure as
Sealing the doors and keeping it sealed—
For those with desire in guarding
Are not as tranquil as those without desire.

When others point out your flaws, resentment arises;
When overseers see your ugliness, you mend your ways.
If one can interact with others without entangling oneself,
They are free from burdens.

To divide wealth by casting lots,
Intent is less fair than disinterest;
To guard wealth by sealing doors,
Desire is less secure than contentment.

「To point out another’s flaws brings resentment,
Yet to love one’s own faults is unnatural.
To see another’s ugliness prompts self-improvement,
Yet to cherish one’s own flaws is self-deception.
Only those who interact with others without entangling themselves in their affairs
Have no such faults, and others find none in them.

Laozi said:
When dealing with others,
If one does not offer treasures or wealth,
They will use humble words,
Yet their greed will never be sated.
With a humble demeanor, they avoid flattery,
And their discussions and dealings remain uncorrupted.

To bind with oaths and alliances,
Yet break them before the appointed day—
This is why the virtuous do not outwardly display benevolence and righteousness
While inwardly cultivating virtue and moral power.
They govern their own lands,
Expand their territories,
Encourage the people to defend their lives,
Strengthen their walls and fortresses,
And unite the people in heart,
So that together they may guard the ancestral altars and the state.
Thus, they do not punish the innocent,
Nor exploit the scarce for private gain—
This is the Dao of preserving completeness,
The principle of ensuring benefit.

To deal with others by offering treasures and wealth,
Their greed will never be sated.
To bind with humble words,
Their agreements will falter before the appointed day.

Only when one inwardly cultivates virtue and moral power,
And unites the people in heart,
Can they guard the ancestral altars and the state,
And protect the people.
Then their Dao is complete.

Laozi said:
The Sage does not conquer their own heart,
While the common people cannot conquer their desires.
The virtuous follow the upright *qi*,
The petty follow the perverse *qi*.
What aligns with nature within,
And conforms to righteousness without,
Moving according to principle without clashing with things—
This is the upright *qi*.
What indulges in flavors and luxuries,
Revels in sound and color,
Acts on whims and anger,
Without regard for future consequences—
This is the perverse *qi*.
The perverse and the upright harm each other,
Desire and nature conflict,
They cannot coexist—
One flourishes while the other declines.
Thus, the Sage diminishes desire to follow nature.

The eyes love color,
The ears love sound,
The nose loves fragrance,
The mouth loves flavor—
When all are indulged,
They cannot escape the harm of craving and desire.
The ears, eyes, nose, and mouth,
If they do not know what to desire,
Are governed by the heart,
Each finding its proper place.
From this, it is clear that desire cannot be conquered.

The Dao-heart and the human-heart,
The distinction between Heaven’s principle and human desire.
When principle prevails,
All actions are Heavenly.
When desire prevails,
All actions are human—
This is the distinction between the virtuous and the petty.

Principle and desire conquer each other,
The perverse and the upright harm each other—
The virtuous do not indulge in such,
How much less would the Sage?

Laozi said:
To cultivate the body and nurture nature,
One must regulate sleep and rest,
Moderate food and drink,
Harmonize joy and anger,
Balance movement and stillness.
What is gained within,
The perverse *qi* cannot enter.

To adorn the exterior while harming the interior,
To indulge emotions while damaging the spirit—
Those who see only outward appearances
Are blind to their true nature.
He who forgets his virtue for even a moment
Will be constrained in his nature,
He who forgets his true nature within a hundred paces
Will burden his form.
Thus, those with beautiful feathers
Are wounded in their bones,
Those with lush branches
Are harmed at their roots.
None in the world can possess both beauties.
The true Dao nurtures the spirit,
The human Dao nurtures the form.
What is gained within is lasting,
What is gained without is fleeting.
To distance oneself from sound and color,
To moderate flavors and tastes—
This is the human Dao of nurturing the form.
To sever thought and contemplation,
To preserve the vital *qi*—
This is the true Dao of nurturing the spirit.
To cultivate the body and nurture nature,
Is to gain both within and without—
How can one seek this through appearance, voice, or countenance?

Laozi said:
Heaven has its light,
Yet it does not fear the people’s darkness.
Earth has its wealth,
Yet it does not fear the people’s poverty.
The truly Daoist, like a mountain,
Remain unmoved and steady.
The traveler takes them as a guide,
Straightforward yet sufficient in their offerings,
Not seeking to bestow,
Nor receiving gratitude in return.
Thus, they are tranquil and endure.
Heaven and Earth have no part in it,
So nothing is taken from them—
No virtue is claimed,
So no resentment arises.
Those who are skilled at anger
Will invite many grievances,
Those who are skilled at giving
Will invite many takings—
Only by following Heaven and Earth’s natural course
Can one conquer principle.
Thus, praise leads to blame,
Goodness leads to evil,
Harm begins with benefit,
Calamity follows fortune—
To not seek benefit is to avoid harm,
To not seek fortune is to avoid calamity.
Preserving completeness is the norm for the body,
Wealth and honor are but temporary lodgings.

The Sage illuminates the land,
Yet the people do not grow dim,
The Sage stores riches in the world,
Yet the people do not grow poor.
To follow Heaven and Earth’s natural course,
To allow all things to grow of their own accord—
Not to hoard for oneself,
Thus no need for public seizure,
Not to bestow lightly,
Thus no need for harsh punishment.
To regard wealth and honor as passing clouds,
Is to preserve one’s true nature.

Laozi said:
The Sage wears no extravagant garments,
Nor practices deceptive conduct.
Their clothing is simple,
Their actions unobserved,
Their way is open yet not ostentatious,
Their poverty is unshaken,
Their honor is not flaunted,
Their obscurity is not humiliating,
Their strangeness is not bizarre—
Their use is the same as all others,
Yet cannot be named—
This is called *Da Tong* (Great Harmony).

Plain yet hidden,
Strange yet not bizarre—
The virtuous do not indulge in such.

Extravagant garments,
Deceptive conduct—
How could these be the Sage’s affairs?
Their brilliance does not dazzle,
Their integrity is not ostentatious—
They simply share in the people’s common use.
This is called *Da Tong* (Great Harmony).

Laozi said:
The Daoist lives straightforward,
Waiting for their fate.
When time arrives,
It cannot be hastened or repelled.
When time departs,
It cannot be pursued or retained.
Thus, the Sage does not advance to seek,
Nor retreat to yield.
Three years of following time,
Time departs and they move on.
Three years of waiting for time,
Time comes after them—
Neither departing nor arriving,
They remain steadfast in their place.

Heaven’s Dao knows no favoritism,
Only virtue is bestowed.
When fortune comes,
It is not sought by oneself,
So they do not claim its merit.
When calamity arrives,
It is not generated by oneself,
So they do not regret their actions.
Their center is serene,
Not burdened by virtue,
The barking of dogs does not startle them,
They trust their own nature—
Their sincerity knows no division.

Thus, those who understand the Dao are not perplexed,
Those who know fate are not anxious.
When the Emperor dies,
Their remains are buried in the wild,
Yet their spirit is enshrined in the Bright Hall,
For the spirit is nobler than the form.
Thus, if the spirit governs the form,
They prosper.
If the form conquers the spirit,
They decline.
Though cleverness may be employed,
It must ultimately return to the spirit—
This is called *Da Tong* (Great Harmony).」

「The Dao is the shared path of all under Heaven. The Sage aligns with their true nature and awaits fate, neither grasping nor rejecting as fortune comes and goes. They stand at the center, governing the four directions—
Not claiming merit when prosperity arrives,
Nor regretting actions when calamity strikes.
Their mind remains tranquil,
Understanding the Dao and knowing fate,
Though cleverness is employed,
It must ultimately return to the spirit—

Laozi says: Those of old who preserved themselves
Found joy in virtue and forgot lowliness,
Thus their resolve was steadfast—*unmovable by ambition*.
They delighted in the Dao and forgot poverty,
Thus their gain was *unshaken by desire*.
Hence, they could be humble yet joyful,
Quiet yet serene.

Measuring life by years,
They fretted over the world’s chaos,
As one might fear the drying of the Yellow River,
Weeping to nourish it instead.
Thus, those who do not fret over the world’s chaos
But rejoice in their own order,
May be spoken to of the Dao.

The Dao reveres virtue and values power,
Giving delight to all hearts and preserving all within.
Thus, it does not stir their mind with poverty or lowliness,
For when their own nature is ordered,
The world’s turmoil is no longer a cause for worry.
Would they then burden themselves with concerns
For a life not even a hundred years long?
Laozi says: There are three sources of resentment in people—
Those with high rank are envied by others,
Those with great office are distrusted by their lord,
Those with abundant wealth are resented by the people.

The higher the rank, the lower the intent,
The greater the office, the smaller the heart,
The richer the wealth, the broader the giving.
Cultivating these three,
Resentment does not arise.

Thus, nobility finds its root in humility,
Elevation in submission as its foundation.
High rank breeds arrogance,
Others will envy it.
Great office fosters pride,
The lord will distrust it.
Abundant wealth without generosity,
Others will resent it.
This is the Dao of *mutual undermining*—

Only through humility and generosity,
Without forgetting lowliness or submission,
Is resentment avoided.

Laozi says: Speech is the means by which one conveys their own nature to others,
Hearing is the means by which others convey their nature to oneself.
If one is both deaf and blind,
The Dao cannot pass through them.
Thus, those afflicted with deafness and blindness,
Do not know how to convey or receive the Dao—
And is it only the body that can be deaf and blind?
The heart too can be sealed,
Unknowing how to convey or receive.
This is the kind of deafness and blindness.

The Dao as the ultimate principle,
All things with form arise from it—
As its kin, they are also close to it.
Those who nourish on grains and *qi*,
All attain longevity—
As its ruler, they are also blessed.
All who are wise learn from it—
As its teacher, they are also enlightened.

Most people harm what is useful by clinging to what is useless,
Thus they know not enough and their days are insufficient.
They seek the Dao in the midst of games of chance,
Their knowledge and insight deepen.
Without hearing or inquiry,
They are like the deaf and blind among people.

To receive form and live,
Is the kin’s favor.
To nourish on grains and attain longevity,
Is the ruler’s blessing.
Through learning, they become enlightened,
Is the teacher’s virtue.
To grow and become an adult,
Is also a kind of nobility.

Speech is the voice of the heart—
To convey oneself to others,
Without words, one cannot be heard;
To receive others into oneself,
Without words, one cannot be understood.
Thus, speech is the expression of the spirit.

If one does not let private words obstruct public words,
And does not harm what is useful by clinging to what is useless,
Then they hear the Dao deeply
And do not stand alone against their superiors.

Laozi says: Human nature,
The heart submits to virtue,
Not to force.
Virtue lies in giving, not in seeking.

Thus, the Sage who wishes to be noble among others,
First makes others noble.
Who wishes to be revered among others,
First reveres others.
Who wishes to conquer others,
First conquers themselves.
Who wishes to humble others,
First humbles themselves.
Hence, nobility and humility,
Reverence and lowliness,
The Dao governs them.

The ancient Sages,
With their words, they led the people,
With their bodies, they followed behind.
Thus, the world gladly pushed them forward,
Yet they did not weary of it,
And gladly bore them up,
Yet they did not grow heavy—
This was virtue overflowing and *qi* in harmony.
Hence, they knew that giving was taking,
And following was leading.
They nearly reached the Dao.

Ritual values precedence,
Speech values humility—
This is human nature,
Thus they can be swayed by virtue,
Not by force.
Hence, the Sage moves with measured steps,
And acts with appropriate timing,
Thus the world gladly pushes them forward
And gladly bears them up.

Laozi says: Those with little virtue but much favor are ridiculed,
Those with inferior talent but high position are in danger,
Those with no great deeds but abundant wealth are despised.
Thus, some things benefit by being increased,
While others are harmed by it.
Some things are harmed by being decreased,
While others benefit by it.

The common people know only to seek what is advantageous,
Yet they do not know to avoid what is harmful.
Only the Sage knows that harm can be advantageous,
And advantage can be harmful.

Thus, the twice-hewn tree,
Its roots must be wounded.
The household that hoards much,
Its future must be cursed.
The greatest advantage,
Becomes a source of harm—
This is the Dao of Heaven.

Virtue is never sated by abundance,
But one’s portion must not be exceeded.
Shallow waters cannot bear a great vessel,
Shallow roots cannot sustain a tall tree.
If a person’s virtue is thin and their talent shallow,
Yet they hold high office without benevolence,
They will rarely avoid ruin.
Only if one knows the reversals of advantage and harm,
And does not cling to excessive hoarding,
Attaining harmony between righteousness and gain,
Then what harm remains?

Laozi says: The petty person pursues gain with *guǒdé* (merely obtain),
The noble person pursues righteousness with *guǒyì* (merely uphold).
Those who do good are not seeking fame,
Yet fame follows them.
Fame does not wait for advantage,
Yet advantage returns to them.
What they seek is the same,
What they strive for is different.

Thus, gain brings harm in its wake.
Those whose words lack truth,
Whose actions lack propriety,
Are petty people.
Those who excel in one matter,
And are skilled in one ability,
Are mediocre.
Those who encompass all and possess all,
Whose abilities are matched by their talent,
Are the Sage.

Round heads and square feet,
Teeth clenched and hair worn,
All are human.
Yet the *qi* they inherit differs,
And wisdom and folly divide them.

The petty person merely obtains,
Their talent outweighs their virtue;
The noble person merely upholds righteousness,
Their virtue outweighs their talent.
If one can ascend or descend,
They are mediocre.
If Heaven grants them many talents,
Then they are the Sage.

Laozi says: Life is a borrowed state,
Death is the return to it.
Thus, in times of order,
They defend righteousness with their life,
In times of chaos,
They defend their life with righteousness.
On the day of death,
Their actions reach their end.

Thus, the noble person carefully attends to this single use alone.»

The life one receives is from Heaven,
The fate one encounters is from the times.
To possess talent yet not meet the age—this is Heaven’s will.
To seek it must follow the Way,
To obtain it lies in fate.

The noble person may act virtuously,
Yet cannot guarantee receiving blessings,
May refrain from wrongdoing,
Yet cannot be certain of avoiding calamity.

Thus, when the time is right, they advance with righteousness—what greater fortune?
When the time is not, they withdraw with propriety—what greater misfortune?
Yet even in poverty and lowliness, they regret nothing,
For they have found what is truly precious.

Born by Heaven’s command,
Shaped into human form—
Life is a borrowed state,
Death is the return to it.
What one encounters in the times
May bring hardship or prosperity—
What is not fate?

To have talent yet not meet the age—this is Heaven’s will.
Thus, the noble person acts virtuously,
Yet blessings are not guaranteed;
They refrain from wrongdoing,
Yet calamity is not always avoided.

When the time is right, they ride the tide;
When it is not, they travel with humility—
Nobility lies within.

Laozi says:
Within the heart, there is the *qi* of harmony and discord.
When the heart is ordered, the *qi* flows smoothly;
When the heart is disordered, the *qi* becomes inverted.
The order or disorder of the heart lies in the Dao.

To attain the Dao is to order the heart;
To lose the Dao is to disorder it.
An ordered heart brings mutual yielding;
A disordered heart brings mutual contention.
Yielding brings virtue;
Contention breeds harm.
Virtue brings smooth *qi*;
Harm brings inverted *qi*.
Smooth *qi* means self-sacrifice to benefit others;
Inverted *qi* means harming others for self-gain.
The *qi* can be regulated by the Dao.

Heaven’s Way is like the echo answering sound—
Virtue accumulated brings blessings;
Calamity accumulated brings resentment.
Learning is undermined by official favor;
Filial piety wanes through wife and children;
Trouble arises from neglecting worries;
Illness worsens when near recovery.
Thus, to attend to the end as to the beginning,
Is to have no failed endeavors.

*The Yinshu* says:
Five harms dwell in the heart,
Manifesting in Heaven’s realm—
Smooth *qi* brings order,
Inverted *qi* brings chaos.
Order brings mutual yielding;
Chaos brings mutual contention.
When *qi* inverts in the heart,
It harms the self.
When *qi* inverts with the times,
It harms the state.
Only by the Dao can *qi* be regulated,
Thus one can sacrifice self to benefit others.
Though officials may flourish, they cannot undermine my learning;
Though wife and children may weaken my filial piety,
What harm from neglected worries?
What illness from near recovery?
To attend to the end with care,
Is to lose nothing.

Laozi says:
To raise the crooked with the straight—
How could this not succeed?
To raise the straight with the crooked—
Do not let them proceed.
This is called "same filth, different mud."
Why not say "raise the crooked and set the straight"?
But to raise the crooked with the straight—
This is to elevate the petty and return them to the noble—
How could this not succeed?
To raise the straight with the crooked—
This is to push the noble into the petty’s domain—
The noble will not go.
Same filth, different mud—
To dwell in the petty’s Way,
Harmonious yet unmoved.

Laozi says:
The Sage treats death and life alike,
The fool also treats death and life alike.
The Sage’s equality of death and life
Lies in understanding the divisions of principle;
The fool’s equality of death and life
Lacks knowledge of where harm and benefit lie.

The Dao is the countenance of Heaven,
Things are the spread of Earth,
Harmony belongs to humanity.
When the ruler is not harmonious,
Heaven’s *qi* does not descend,
Earth’s *qi* does not ascend,
Yin and Yang are unbalanced,
Winds and rains are untimely,
And the people suffer hunger and sickness.
Harmony’s use is supreme.

Heaven gains clarity in all phenomena,
Earth gains life in all things,
Humanity gains success in all endeavors.
How could the ruler’s heart lose harmony?
To lose it means Heaven and Earth do not interact,
And the people suffer hunger and sickness.

Though the Sage and the fool share death and life,
Their difference lies between righteousness and self-interest.
Self-interest is the harmony of righteousness—
The Sage understands principle,
And even the division of benefits is righteousness.
The fool knows not where harm and benefit lie,
And righteousness becomes self-interest.

Laozi says:
To command ten thousand soldiers
Is not as valuable as hearing a single appropriate word;
To possess the Random Marquis’ pearl
Is not as valuable as knowing the origin of things;
To possess the He Shi’s jade
Is not as valuable as knowing the proper course of things.

Though the world be vast,
Those who delight in war perish;
Though a state be secure,
Those who love war are in danger.
Thus, even small states with tenfold weapons
Should not use them.

Yu bowed to Chang Yan:
"Return the troops, and the Miao people will submit."
To hear a single appropriate word
Is to triumph over ten thousand armies.
To possess the Random pearl and He Shi’s jade
Is not as valuable as knowing the origin and proper course of things.

Thus, the Sage values the Dao over treasures,
And virtue over achievements.
Would they willingly endanger themselves with arms?

Laozi says:
Those who can achieve hegemony
Must first excel in virtue;
Those who can defeat enemies
Must first be strong;
Those who can be strong
Must first employ the people’s strength;
Those who can employ the people’s strength
Must first win the people’s hearts;
Those who can win the people’s hearts
Must first attain self-mastery;
Those who attain self-mastery
Must first be gentle and yielding;
Those who can defeat those not their equal
Yet submit to those their equal
And yield to those superior—
Gentle strength emerges beyond their equal,
Its effects are beyond measure.
Thus, only the Sage can
Turn many who cannot win
Into great victory.

Excellence in virtue brings hegemony—
Winning the people’s hearts.
Victory over enemies brings strength—
Employing the people’s strength.
Yet without winning the people’s hearts,
No one can employ their strength.
How then can enemies be defeated?
How can strength achieve hegemony?
Virtue is self-mastery.
Self-mastery makes gentle strength conquer the rigid.
Thus, to defeat those not one’s equal,
Yet submit to those one’s equal—
This is virtue being equal.
Gentle strength emerges beyond one’s equal—
Then virtue surpasses even me.
Thus, only the Sage can
Turn many who cannot win
Into great victory.

*Completing the Continuation of the True Mysterious Classic, Volume Four.*

**Continuation of the True Mysterious Classic, Volume Five**
*Southern Valley Master Du Daojian’s Compilation*
**Chapter on Dao and Virtue**

Wenzi asked about the Dao, and Laozi replied:
*"Learning and inquiry are not refined, listening to the Way is not profound.
All who listen seek to attain wisdom,
To perfect their conduct,
To achieve fame and merit.
Without refinement, there is no clarity;
Without depth, there is no understanding.
Thus, the highest learning listens with the spirit,
The middle with the heart,
The lowest with the ears.
He who listens with the ears learns only on the surface;
He who listens with the heart learns to the marrow;
He who listens with the spirit learns to the bone.
If listening is not profound, knowledge remains unclear;
If knowledge is unclear, one cannot exhaust its essence;
If one cannot exhaust its essence, conduct cannot be fulfilled.

The principle of listening is this:
Empty the heart, clear the mind,
Diminish the qi, let it not overflow,
Hold no thoughts, no deliberations,
Let the eyes see nothing in vain,
Let the ears hear nothing carelessly.
Concentrate with precision, accumulate within—
Let the inner intent gather and merge.
Once attained, guard it firmly,
Hold it steadfastly.

Human nature is the Dao,
Nature’s goodness is virtue—
Dao and virtue reside within us.
Thus, the Sage knows without learning—
This is called the Dao.
To cultivate it is called teaching—
Thus, what is within us is applied to others.

The middling and below can all learn it:
Listening with the ears brings delight to the heart,
Like a mirror polished—
Its light shines forth from within.
Is this not what the heart inherently possesses?
Through study, it is made clear—
To cultivate the self brings virtue to fruition,
To govern the state brings success to undertakings.
This shows how refined learning illuminates the heart.

The Dao has no beginning in origin,
It begins with gentleness and weakness,
Completes with strength and vigor,
Begins with few and short,
Completes with many and long.
A ten-surrounding tree begins as a sapling,
A hundred-foot tower begins with a foundation.
This is the Dao of Heaven.

The Sage follows it:
The lowly humble themselves,
The retiring step back,
The frugal diminish themselves,
The self-effacing reduce themselves—
Thus, lowliness becomes exalted,
Retreat becomes precedence,
Frugality becomes abundance,
Self-effacement becomes greatness.
This is how the Dao of Heaven is fulfilled.

Qi is the formless essence,
Things are the formed *qi*.
The formless is thus gentle and weak,
The formed is thus strong and rigid.
Thus, *qi* is the origin of form.
The Dao generates virtue, nurtures it,
From subtlety to manifestation.
The Sage follows it,
Establishing its essence, enacting its function—
The Dao of Heaven is complete.

The Dao is the root of virtue,
The root of Heaven,
The gate to blessings—
All things depend on it to arise,
Depend on it to flourish,
Depend on it to find peace.
The Dao is non-action, formless,
Within, it cultivates the self;
Without, it governs others—
Achieving success, establishing deeds.
It aligns with Heaven,
Does nothing yet accomplish all—
No one knows its essence,
No one knows its truth,
Yet within it, there is sincerity.

When the Son of Heaven has the Dao,
The world submits, and the altars endure.
When lords and marquises have the Dao,
The people live in harmony, their states unlost.
When scholars and commoners have the Dao,
They preserve their bodies, protect their kin.
The strong with the Dao conquer without war;
The weak with the Dao gain without strife.
Undertakings with the Dao succeed, bringing blessings.
Between ruler and subject, the Dao brings loyalty and benevolence;
Between father and son, the Dao brings filial piety and kindness;
Among scholars and commoners, the Dao brings mutual love.
Thus, with the Dao, there is harmony;
Without it, there is harshness.

From this, it is seen:
The Dao applies to all people.
Virtue roots in the heart,
Spirit manifests outward.
Success achieved, deeds established—
Aligned with Heaven.
From the Son of Heaven to the commoner,
With the Dao, there is prosperity;
Without it, there is stagnation.

The Dao:
Small practice brings small blessings,
Great practice brings great blessings,
Perfect practice brings the world’s submission—
Submission brings loyalty.
Thus, the Emperor is the world’s *adaptation*,
The King is the world’s *direction*—
Without adaptation or direction, one cannot be called Emperor or King.
Thus, without the people, even the Sage cannot succeed;
Gaining the people yet losing the Dao cannot be sustained.

Those who lose the Dao:
Are extravagant, arrogant, and licentious,
Proud and insolent, boastful and domineering,
Seeking to outshine others, grasping at power—
They become the instigators of strife,
The leaders of rebellion.
When commoners act thus, they bring ruin upon themselves;
When the great act thus, their states perish—
Shallowly affecting themselves,
Deeply affecting their descendants.
Thus, no crime is greater than losing the Dao,
No resentment deeper than lacking virtue.
This is the Dao of Heaven.

The root of the body lies in virtue,
The root of virtue lies in the Dao.
Whether small or great,
Practice it and you attain it—
The world submits to you,
Submission brings loyalty.
The Emperor is *adaptation*,
The King is *direction*—
The world adapts and follows—
This is called Emperor and King.
Yet only with the people can one succeed,
Only with the Dao can one endure—
Not becoming the instigator of war,
Not becoming the leader of rebellion.
Lose the Dao and there is chaos,
Lose virtue and there is resentment.
This is the Dao of Heaven.

Laozi said:
*"Those who practice the Dao make even the bold
So that spears cannot pierce them,
Make even the cunning
So that strikes cannot find them.
Yet even so, they may still be humiliated—
Better to make the bold not dare to strike,
The cunning not dare to attack.
But even this is not as good as
Making them have no such intent at all.
And even this is not as good as
Making them have no desire for gain.
If all men and women in the world
Were to joyfully seek what is beneficial—
Then even without a throne, one would be the sovereign,
Without an office, one would be the leader—
And all would willingly seek what is beneficial for them.*

*The Dao does not deliberately respond to things,
Yet things respond to it.
To be unharmed by spears or strikes
Is not as good as
Making all joyfully desire what is beneficial—
Thus, even without a throne, one is the sovereign,
Without an office, one is the leader—
And all willingly seek what is beneficial for them."*

「In ancient times, there was a man named Gēngsāngzǐ, whose virtue was such.

Wénzǐ asked about virtue, and Lǎozǐ replied:
To **nurture** and **cultivate** [畜之养之],
To **fulfill** and **lead** [遂之长之],
To **comprehend** and **share benefits** without discrimination [兼利无择],
And to **harmonize** with Heaven and Earth [与天地合]—
This is what is called virtue [此之谓德].

What is meant by *rén* [仁]?
For the ruler, it means not **boasting** of one’s achievements [为上不矜其功],
For the subjects, it means not **shaming** their weaknesses [为下不羞其病].
Toward the great, one is not **arrogant** [於大不矜],
Toward the small, one is not **petty** [於小不偷],
To **cherish** and **love** without selfishness [兼爱无私],
And to endure without **waning** [久而不衰]—
This is what is called *rén* [仁].

What is meant by *yì* [义]?
For the ruler, it means **supporting** the weak [为上即辅弱],
For the subjects, it means **upholding** propriety [为下即守节].
When prosperous, one does not **indulge** in willfulness [达不肆意],
When in adversity, one does not **alter** one’s principles [穷不易操].
To **adhere** to a single standard and **conform** to the natural order [一度顺理],
Without **bending** to private gain or **perverting** justice [不私枉挠]—
This is what is called *yì* [义].

What is meant by *lǐ* [礼]?
For the ruler, it means **reverent** and **solemn** conduct [为上即恭严],
For the subjects, it means **humble** and **respectful** bearing [为下即卑敬].
To **retreat** and **yield**, guarding gentleness [退让守柔],
And to **embody** the receptive principle for all under Heaven [为天下雌],
To **stand** where none dare [立於不敢],
And to **establish** what none can [设於不能]—
This is what is called *lǐ* [礼].

Thus, when one cultivates virtue, the subjects **obey** one’s commands [修其德则下从令],
When one cultivates *rén* [仁], the subjects do not **quarrel** [修其仁则下不争],
When one cultivates *yì* [义], the subjects are **fair** and **upright** [修其义即下平正],
When one cultivates *lǐ* [礼], the subjects **hold one in honor** [修其礼则下尊敬].
If these four are all cultivated, the state is **secure** and **tranquil** [国家安宁].

Hence, **Dao/Way** is what gives rise to things [物生者道也],
Virtue is what makes them grow [长者德也],
*Rén* [仁] is what brings love [爱者仁也],
Justice is what brings rectitude [正者义也],
Respect is what brings reverence [敬者礼也].

Without **nurturing** or **cultivating**, one cannot **fulfill** and **lead** to growth [不畜不养，不能遂长].
Without **compassion** and **love**, one cannot **achieve** and **complete** [不慈不爱，不能成遂].
Without **rectitude** and **upholding**, one cannot **endure** and **last** [不正不匡，不能久长].
Without **reverence** and **favor**, one cannot **be held in esteem** [不敬不宠，不能贵重].

Thus, virtue is what the people **value** [德者，民之所贵也],
*Rén* [仁] is what the people **cherish** [仁者，民之所怀也],
*Yì* [义] is what the people **fear** [义者，民之所畏也],
*Lǐ* [礼] is what the people **revere** [礼者，民之所敬也].
These four are the **orderly principles** of culture [此四者，文之顺也],
By which the **sage** governs all things [圣人之所以御万物也].

If a **gentleman** lacks virtue, the subjects **resent** him [无德即下怨],
If he lacks *rén* [仁], the subjects **quarrel** [无仁即下争],
If he lacks *yì* [义], the subjects **act violently** [无义即下暴],
If he lacks *lǐ* [礼], the subjects **become disorderly** [无礼即下乱].
The four **classical teachings** [四经] not established—
This is called **lacking Dao/Way** [谓之无道].
There is none who lacks Dao/Way yet does not **perish** [无道不亡者，未之有也].

Virtue is the **overarching name** of the Five Constants [德者，五常之总名].
A person with virtue possesses the Five Constants in full [有德之人，五常备焉].
*Cí* [慈] is **benevolence** [七则慈],
*Yì* [义] is **appropriateness** [义则宜],
*Lǐ* [礼] is **reverence** [礼则敬],
*Zhì* [智] is **clarity** [知则明],
*Sīn* [信] is **truthfulness** [信则实].
These are called the Five Constants [有之是谓五常],
Or also the Five Virtues [一曰五德].
No **gentleman** has ever lacked virtue yet been able to **serve the state** [君子未有无德而能为国家者矣].

Wénzǐ’s inquiry was for the **benefit** of all under Heaven and future generations [文子之问，为天下后世发也],
His virtue was indeed **vast** [其德博哉].

Lǎozǐ said:
In the age of **supreme virtue** [至德之世],
Merchants found **profit** in the markets [贾便於市],
Farmers took **joy** in the fields [农乐於野],
Great officials **rested content** in their duties [大夫安其职处],
Scholars **refined** their **Dao/Way** [士修其道],
And the people **rejoiced** in their **occupations** [人民乐其业].
Thus, the winds and rains did not **destroy** or **break** [风雨不毁折],
Grasses and trees did not **wither** and **die** prematurely [草木不夭死],
The Yellow River **unveiled** its **Turtle Scripture** [河出图],
And the Luo River **revealed** its **Book of History** [洛出书].
But when the age **declined** [及世之衰也],
Taxes and levies were **without measure** [赋敛无度],
Slayings were **without end** [杀戮无止],
And **punishments** were meted out to the **virtuous** [刑谏者，杀贤士],
Thus the mountains **collapsed** and the rivers **ran dry** [山崩川涸],
Worms and insects **teemed** without rest [蠕动不息],
And the fields **yielded no grain** [野无百蔬].
Hence, when the age is **well-ordered**, even the **foolish** cannot **act alone in chaos** [愚者不得独乱],
And when the age is **disordered**, even the **wise** cannot **restore order alone** [贤者不能独治].

Thus, the **sage** **harmonizes** and **adapts**, **preserving tranquility**—
This is **life** [生也].
To **fulfill one’s aspirations** and **practice the Dao/Way**—
This is **fate** [命也],
So **life** depends on **fate**, and only then can one **act** [生遭命而后能行],
And **fate** is realized when the **time** is right [命得时而后能明].
There must first be its **age**, and only then can there be its **person** [必有其世，而后有其人].
Heaven’s **regard** for humanity is like a father’s **regard** for his children,
Its **love** is **equally distributed** [其爱均也].

The **ruler** is Heaven’s **firstborn son** [天之元子],
And the people are Heaven’s **cherished children** [民，天之赤子].
If the ruler does not **care** for the people [上不恤下],
Heaven will **send warnings** [天必示儆].

In the age of **supreme virtue**, love is **equally distributed** and **harmonizes** with Heaven [爱均合天],
All things **grow** in accordance [万物遂长],
And the people **rejoice** in their **occupations** [民乐其业].
When the age **declines**, harsh governance **disrupts** harmony [苛政干和],
Heaven’s **wrath** **shakes** and **reveals** itself [天怒震发],
The earth **manifests** its **calamities** [地见其灾],
The state **abounds** in **difficulties** [国家多难],
And **plagues** spread among the people [流毒民人].
Only the **sage** **harmonizes** and **adapts**, **preserving tranquility**,
Fulfills his **aspirations**, and **practices the Dao/Way**,
Thus the people and things **grow** in accordance [民物遂生].
This is what is meant by:
There must first be its **age**, and only then can there be its **person** [有其世而后有其人].

Wénzǐ asked about **sagely wisdom** [圣智],
And Lǎozǐ replied:
To **hear** and **know** [闻而知之] is **sagely wisdom** [圣也],
To **see** and **know** [见而知之] is **wisdom** [智也].
Thus, the **sage** always **listens** to where **calamity** and **blessing** arise,
And **chooses** his **Dao/Way** accordingly [而择其道],
While the **wise** always **observe** where **calamity** and **blessing** take form,
And **chooses** their **conduct** accordingly [而择其行].
The **sage** knows the **Dao/Way** of Heaven’s **auspicious** and **inauspicious** signs [故知祸福所生],
Thus he knows where **calamity** and **blessing** arise.
The **wise** **foresee** the **formed** signs,
Thus he knows the **gates** of **calamity** and **blessing** [故知祸福之门].
To **hear** before they arise—this is **sagely wisdom** [闻未生，圣也],
To **foresee** the **formed** signs—this is **wisdom** [先见成形，智也],
Without **hearing** or **seeing**, one is **foolish** and **bewildered** [无闻见者愚迷也].

Why does the **sage** not say *shēngzhī* [生知] but *wénzhī* [闻知]?
For **innate knowledge** is **within oneself** [生知道在我者也],
While **acquired knowledge** is **from external matters** [闻知事在外者也].
The **sage** **knows** before it **happens** [闻於未然],
Thus **calamity** and **blessing** are **foreseen** [祸福先知].
**Wisdom**, however, must **await** the **formation** of events before **seeing** [必待事成而后见],
And the **foolish** are **drowned** in **hearing** and **seeing**,
Yet **never** truly **know themselves** [终不自知],
Their **bewilderment** is indeed **great** [迷亦甚矣].

Lǎozǐ said:
If a **ruler** **loves** to **know** [好知],
He will **trust** the **times** and **rely** on himself [信时而任己],
**Discard** the **calculations** of fate [弃数],
And **employ** **benevolence** [用惠].
Things are **abundant** in **wisdom** but **shallow** in **understanding** [物博智浅],
To **sustain** abundance with shallowness—
This has never **existed** [以浅赡博，未之有也].
To **rely solely** on one’s **wisdom**,
One’s **failures** will be **many** [独任其智，失必多矣].
To **love wisdom** is to **exhaust** one’s **arts** [好智，穷术也],
To **love courage** is to **court** **peril** and **ruin** [好勇，危亡之道也].
To **love giving** is to **lack** a **fixed portion** [好与则无定分],
If the ruler’s **portion** is **not fixed** [上之分不定],
Then the people’s **expectations** will be **without end** [下之望无止].
If he **taxes excessively**, he will **become a target** for the people’s **resentment** [若多敛即与民为条],
Taking little yet giving much—
His **numbers** will **never** be **sufficient** [其数无有],
Thus, to **love giving** is the **path** to **inviting grievances** [故好与，来怨之道也].
From this, it can be seen:
That **wealth** is **insufficient** to **sustain** governance,
And that **Dao/Way** and **arts** can **depend** on **clarity** [财不足任，道术可因明矣].

The **wise** do not **do** what they **cannot** do [智者不为其所不能为],
Nor **force** what they **cannot** force [强所不能].
If one does so, it is **not wisdom** [则非智矣].
Then can wisdom truly be **loved**?
To **love wisdom** is to **exhaust** one’s **arts** [好智则术易穷],
To **love giving** is to **lack** a **fixed portion** [好与则分不定].
Excessive **taxation** **provokes** the people’s **retaliation** [多敛民雠],
And **inviting grievances** is the **means** to **disorder** [来怨之媒也].

Wénzǐ asked:
How did the **ancient kings** govern all under Heaven by **Dao/Way** [古之王者以道莅天下为之奈何]?
Lǎozǐ replied:
By **holding to the One** and **doing nothing** [执一无为],
**Conforming** with Heaven and Earth’s **transformations** [因天地与之变化].
All under Heaven is the **great vessel** [天下大器],
Which **cannot** be **grasped** or **acted upon** [不可执也，不可为也].
To **act** upon it is to **ruin** it [为者败之],
To **grasp** it is to **lose** it [执者失之].
To **hold to the One** is to **see** the **small** [执一者见小也],
To **see** the **small** is to **achieve** the **great** [见小故能成大也].
To **do nothing** is to **guard** the **still** [无为者守静也],
To **guard** the **still** is to **bring rectitude** to all under Heaven [守静故能为天下正].」

To dwell in **great fullness** yet **not overflow**,
To occupy **high nobility** yet **not grow arrogant**.
To dwell in **greatness without excess**—
**Full yet unspent**, **elevated yet secure**—
**Full yet unspent**, so as to **long preserve wealth**;
**Elevated yet secure**, so as to **long preserve nobility**.
Thus **wealth and nobility** never depart from one’s person,
And **blessings extend to descendants**—
This was the **ancient kings’ Dao/Way**.

To govern all under Heaven by **Dao/Way** is to **"hold to the One" and "do nothing"**—
How so?
**The One** is **established**.

Thus the **ancient kings**, conforming with Heaven and Earth’s **transformations**,
**Ruled by doing nothing**,
**Saw the small yet did not abandon it**,
**Guarded stillness yet did not act**—
The **great vessel** stood firm, and all under Heaven was **rectified**.

Therefore, to dwell in **greatness without excess**,
To occupy **high station without arrogance**—
**Wealth and nobility** may be **preserved**,
And **descendants** may endure.

Lǎozǐ said:
The people have **Dao/Way** to follow in common,
And **laws** to uphold in common,
Yet **morality cannot bind them**,
Nor **authority compel them**—
Thus **kings are established** to **unify them**.

When the king **holds to the One**, order is achieved;
When he **abandons constancy**, chaos ensues.
The **Way of the king** is not to **act**,
But to **do nothing**.

The **wise** do not **wield virtue as a tool**,
The **courageous** do not **use force as violence**,
The **benevolent** do not **grant favors by rank**—
This is **the One**.
**The One** is the **Dao/Way of no partiality**,
The **root of all things**.

If the king **frequently alters laws**,
And the state **frequently changes rulers**,
Then people **act according to their positions**,
**Expressing their likes and dislikes**—
The common folk **live in fear**, beyond governance.
Thus, when the king **loses the One**, the **foundation of disorder** is worse than **having no king**.
Only when the king **holds to the One** can he **unify the people**.

Though all under Heaven is vast,
The king **unifies it by the One**.
When the king **holds to the One**,
**Dao/Way** requires no **action**—the people **follow in common**;
**Laws** require no **change**—the people **uphold them in common**.
The **wise** do not **wield virtue as a tool**,
The **courageous** do not **use force as violence**,
The **benevolent** do not **grant favors by rank**—
**Unified**, this is the king’s **Way**.

If the king **frequently alters laws**,
And the state **frequently changes rulers**,
This is worse than **having no king**.

Wénzǐ asked:
How many **principles** does the **Way of kingship** encompass?
Lǎozǐ replied:
**One** alone.

Wénzǐ said:
In antiquity, some ruled by **Dao/Way**, others by **force**—
Why are they not the same?
Lǎozǐ said:
Those who ruled by **Dao/Way** did so by **virtue**;
Those who ruled by **force** also did so by **virtue**.

There are **five kinds of warfare**:
**Righteous war**, **Responsive war**, **Angry war**, **Greedy war**, **Arrogant war**.
To **punish tyranny and aid the weak** is called **righteousness**;
When the enemy attacks and there is **no alternative**, to use force is called **responsive**;
To **quarrel over trifles and fail to control one’s anger** is called **anger**;
To **covet another’s land** or **desire their wealth** is called **greed**;
To **rely on one’s nation’s size** and **boast of one’s people’s multitude**, desiring to **appear superior** to enemy states, is called **arrogance**.

**Righteous war** brings **kingship**,
**Responsive war** brings **victory**,
**Angry war** brings **defeat**,
**Greedy war** brings **ruin**,
**Arrogant war** brings **extinction**—
This is the **Dao/Way of Heaven**.

**Dao/Way** is the **root of governance**;
The king rules by **Dao/Way**.
When the **root is lost**, **chaos arises**,
And **warfare ensues**.

Thus, though some ruled by **Dao/Way** and others by **force**,
Though they seemed different, they **both returned to virtue**.
Therefore, of the **five kinds of warfare**, only **righteous war** can bring **kingship**—
Though it is **war**, it is also **Dao/Way**.
Hence it is said: **One alone**.

**Responsive war** brings **victory**,
**Angry war** brings **defeat**,
**Greedy war** brings **ruin**,
**Arrogant war** brings **extinction**—
These are the affairs of the **Warring States**, not the **warfare of kings**.

Lǎozǐ said:
To **abandon Dao/Way** and **rely on cleverness** is **perilous**,
To **discard principles** and **use talent** is **constraining**.
Thus, to **follow one’s proper role** and **conform to reason**—
When **lost**, one need not **fear**,
When **gained**, one need not **rejoice**—
**Success is not what one strives for**,
**Gain is not what one seeks**.

When **receiving**, one **accepts without taking**,
When **giving**, one **bestows without bestowing**.
To **generate in spring**, to **withdraw in autumn**—
What is **generated** is not **resented**,
What is **withdrawn** is not **held in grudge**—
This is **approaching Dao/Way**.

**Dao/Way** lies in **governance**,
**Principles** relate to **timing**.
To **rely on cleverness** and **abandon Dao/Way**,
To **use talent** and **discard principles**—
These are the **steps to peril and constraint**.

Only by **following one’s proper role** and **conforming to reason**,
When **gained**, one does not **rejoice in achievement**,
When **lost**, one does not **fear retreat**—
When **receiving**, one **accepts without taking**,
When **giving**, one **bestows without bestowing**,
To **act in accordance with the seasons**,
**Generation** is not **resented**,
**Withdrawal** is not **held in grudge**—
Then one **approaches Dao/Way**.

Wénzǐ asked:
How does a king **win the people’s affection**?
Lǎozǐ replied:
Like the **great rivers and seas**—
**Diluted**, **without distinct flavor**,
**Used without depletion**,
**First small, then vast**.

Those who **seek to surpass others** must **lower themselves in speech**,
Those who **seek to lead others** must **place themselves last in action**.
All under Heaven will **emulate their affection**,
**Advance their benevolence and righteousness**,
And **lack harshness**.
To **stand above** yet the people **do not feel burdened**,
To **lead ahead** yet the masses **do not feel harmed**—
All under Heaven **joyfully follow** without **tiring**,
Even in **remote lands and alien customs**,
Even among **insects and creatures**—
None fail to **hold them dear**.
There is **nothing they cannot communicate with**,
And **nothing they cannot accomplish**—
Thus they are **held in highest esteem**.

The **rivers and seas** excel in **humility and capacity**,
Thus all streams **flow to them**.
The **ancient kings** modeled themselves after this to **govern**.

To **contain the people** and **nurture the masses**,
Thus they **won the people’s affection**,
And the people **joyfully submitted**—
All under Heaven **rallied to them**.
Even **grasses, trees, and insects** would **submit in awe**—
Their **nobility** is evident.

Lǎozǐ said:
To **clutch the laws of one’s age**,
And **reject the customs of succession**,
Is like **gluing a pillar to a zither**—
**rigid and out of tune**.

The **sage** adapts to **circumstances**, **varies with the times**,
**Sees the form** and **applies what is fitting**.
When **ages change**, **affairs must change**,
When **times shift**, **customs must adapt**.
To **discuss the age** and **establish laws**,
To **follow the times** and **conduct affairs**.

The **ancient kings** had **different laws**—
Not **intentionally contrary**,
But because **circumstances differed**.
Thus, they did not **follow rigidly the laws already set**,
But **followed the principles behind them**,
And **moved with transformation**.

The **sage’s laws** are **worthy of observation**,
But their **origins cannot be traced**,
Their **words can be heard**,
But their **intentions cannot be fully grasped**.

---

The **Three Sovereigns** and **Five Emperors** held the world lightly,
**Cherished all things** with care,
**Equalized life and death**,
**Unified change and transformation**,
**Embraced the Dao/Way** and **pursued sincerity**,
To **mirror the emotions** of all things,
**Above**, they **made the Dao/Way their friend**,
**Below**, they **transformed with humanity**.

Now, if one wishes to **learn their Dao/Way**,
They cannot grasp their **clear and profound, sacred and august** virtue/power,
But must **guard their legal precedents**,
And **follow their decrees and ordinances**,
Or they will **never be able to govern properly**.

The **single qi** circulates,
The **four seasons** shift in succession.
There are **things that cannot be otherwise**—
Such is the **Dao/Way of Heaven**.

The governance of **emperors** and **kings** differs,
Not because of **human contrivance**,
But due to **Heaven’s unfolding**.

Thus, one cannot **cling to the laws of a single age**
And **expect them to govern successive eras**—
Only by **acting according to the times**,
And **adapting measures to circumstances**,
Can one **discuss the age** and **establish laws**.

Like **winter cannot wear hemp cloth**,
And **summer cannot wear fur garments**,
Those who **know the Dao/Way of Heaven** can do this.

**Wenzi** asked about governance,
And **Laozi** replied:
**"Rule with the Dao/Way**, nurture with **virtue/power**,
**Do not flaunt wisdom**, **do not force strength**,
**Reduce excess** while **holding to unity**,
**Do not show favor**, **do not reveal desires**,
**Be square without cutting corners**, **be sharp without piercing**,
**Neither proud nor boastful**.

**"Rule with the Dao/Way**, and the people will **attach themselves**,
**Nurture with virtue/power**, and the people will **submit**,
**Do not flaunt wisdom**, and the people will **remain content**,
**Do not force strength**, and the people will **retain their simplicity**."

**"Do not flaunt wisdom"** means **to be humble**,
**"Do not force strength"** means **to avoid coercion**.
**Below**, they **gather** with **generosity**,
**Take** with **moderation**,
**Practice frugality** to **preserve themselves**,
And **never dare to be complacent**.

**If they do not gather**, they will **scatter**,
**If they do not nurture**, they will **rebel**,
**If they flaunt wisdom**, the people will **vie for advantage**,
**If they force strength**, the people will **resent their rule**.

**When the people scatter**, the **state’s power weakens**,
**When they rebel**, the **ruler loses authority**,
**When they vie for advantage**, they **disregard right and wrong**,
**When they resent their ruler**, the **throne is in peril**.

If these **four principles** are truly **cultivated**,
The **Dao/Way** is nearly **fulfilled**.

The **ancients governed** with **virtue/power and Dao/Way**,
Later ages governed with **achievement and force**.
**With virtue/power and Dao/Way**, the people **submit** and **customs become pure**,
**With achievement and force**, the people **resent** and **wars arise**.

Thus, **"rule with the Dao/Way**, nurture with **virtue/power**,
**Do not flaunt wisdom**, **do not force strength**,
And the world will be **governed without action**."

**Laozi** said:
**"When the ruler speaks, the people act**—
**When the people speak, the ruler acts**—
**When the ruler speaks, it is constant usage**,
**When the people act, it is expedient adaptation**.
Only the **sage** can **know expedient adaptation**,
**Speak and always be believed**,
**Set expectations and always meet them**.

The **highest conduct** in the world:
**To be straight and honor one’s father**,
**To be trustworthy and die for one’s mother**—
Who can **value this**?

Thus, the **sage** **judges right and wrong in affairs**,
**Accommodates with bending and stretching**,
**Has no fixed rituals or appearances**,
**When prosperous, they are called a ‘named lord’**,
**When drowning, they are struck like a father**—
**Power compels this**.

**Expedient adaptation** is what the **sage** **alone perceives**,
**To first oppose and then unite** is called **expedient adaptation**,
**To first unite and then meet** is **not to know expedient adaptation**,
**Not to know expedient adaptation** is **to turn good into evil**.

**"When the ruler speaks and the people act"** is the **substance of expedient adaptation**,
**"When the people act and the ruler responds"** is the **application of expedient adaptation**.
**Substance and application** of **expedient adaptation** **complement each other**,
**No matter the affair**, **all will be fitting**.

Only the **sage** **knows expedient adaptation**,
**Speaks and is always believed**,
**Sets expectations and always meets them**,
**Accommodates with bending and stretching**,
And **judges their opposition and unity**.

If one **clings to the middle without expedient adaptation**,
They **cannot adapt to changing times**.
**Gluing a pillar to a zither**—
**Goodness turns to folly**.

**Wenzi** asked:
"Master, your words say
**That without virtue/power and Dao/Way, one cannot govern the world**,
Yet **the rulers of ancient times**,
**Who inherited their positions and relied on former achievements**,
Also had **those without the Dao/Way** who **preserved their reigns**,
And **no calamity or ruin**—
How was this **Dao/Way** accomplished?"

**Laozi** replied:
"From the **Son of Heaven** down to the **common people**,
Each **lives their own life**,
Yet their **living has degrees of depth**—
The world **at times sees states and families destroyed**,
Not because of **lack of virtue/power and Dao/Way**.

**With virtue/power and Dao/Way**, they **diligently strive day and night**,
**Tremble and fear constantly**,
Ever **mindful of impending danger**.
**Without virtue/power and Dao/Way**, they **indulge desires and grow lax**,
Their **ruin comes without warning**.

If **Jie and Zhou** had **practiced virtue/power and Dao/Way**,
Even **Tang and Wu**, though **wise and virtuous**,
Could **not have established their achievements**.

**Virtue/power and Dao/Way** are **how one nurtures and sustains**,
**How one fosters mutual affection**,
**How one upholds respect and honor**.

Even **deaf insects**, though **foolish**,
**Do not harm what they love**—
If **all people in the world** **harbored hearts of benevolence and righteousness**,
How could **calamities and disasters arise**?

Those **without virtue/power and Dao/Way** yet **without ruin or harm**,
Their **benevolence has not yet perished**, their **righteousness has not yet died**.

Though **benevolence has not yet perished**,
And **righteousness has not yet died**,
The **feudal lords already disregard their ruler**—
When **feudal lords disregard their ruler**,
The **court becomes disrespectful**,
And **even if they do not rebel**, they **do not obey**.

When **benevolence perishes** and **righteousness dies**,
The **feudal lords rebel**,
The **common people seize governance**,
The **strong oppress the weak**,
The **great invade the small**,
And **the people make warfare their profession**—
Disasters **arise**, calamities **begin**,
Their **ruin is imminent**—
How can they **hope to avoid calamity**?

The **ancients who governed the world**,
**Virtue/power and Dao/Way declined** while **benevolence and righteousness took precedence**,
When **benevolence and righteousness declined**, **calamities and wars arose**.

In the **earliest ages**, **successive rulers** like **Jie and Zhou**,
Though their **states were not yet ruined**,
The **feudal lords already held disrespectful thoughts**,
Then **virtue/power and Dao/Way were lost**,
And **benevolence and righteousness declined**.

Thus, **Tang and Wu arose** and **cut off the Xia and Shang**,
And **the Kings You and Li of Zhou** were like **Jie and Zhou**—
Only **a slight difference in talent**,
So they **could not escape** the **great slaughter of war**,
Or the **death at Mount Li**—
The **feudal lords seized governance**,
The **strong oppressed the weak**,
The **great invaded the small**,
The **Six States followed the balance**,
And **Zhou perished with them**—
Is this not **a warning**?

**Laozi** said:
**"When laws are excessive and punishments severe**,
The people **will deceive**,
**When the ruler acts excessively**, the people **will act deceitfully**,
**When demands are many**, **rewards will be few**,
**When prohibitions are many**, **success will be little**,
**Using affairs to create more affairs**,
And **again using affairs to stop affairs**—
Like **stoking a fire and hoping it will not burn**;

**Using wisdom to create troubles**,
And **again using wisdom to guard against them**—
Like **stirring water and hoping it will remain clear**."
**Laws are originally for seeking**,
But **excessive governance brings chaos**;

「Punishments are originally for restraint,
Yet harsh severity will breed deceit.

If the ruler acts excessively and yet expects the people to be free of affairs,
This is like forcing a man to drink and then blaming him for being drunk—
It is to blind the people.

How can this be called governance?

**Laozi** said:
When the sovereign favors **virtue/ren**,
Then the unworthy are rewarded and the guilty are pardoned;
When he favors punishments,
Then the worthy are ruined and the innocent are condemned.

To neither favor nor hate,
He executes punishment without resentment and bestows rewards without expecting gratitude—
He lets the measure flow and the line guide itself,
Uninvolved in affairs, like Heaven and Earth—
How could he not cover and load all under his rule?

To unify and harmonize,
This is the **Dao/Way** of the sovereign;
To separate and execute,
This is the **Dao/Way** of the law.

When the people receive punishment without grievance,
This is called **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**.

To favor **virtue/ren** yet not know how to govern,
To reward the unworthy and pardon the guilty—
This can still harm governance.

To favor punishments yet not know how to apply the law,
To ruin the worthy and execute the innocent—
The harm is profound indeed.

Only when justice is absolute and impartial,
Aligning with **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,
Rewards are not squandered and punishments are not cruel,
Then all officials fulfill their duties and the people embrace their labors,
And the realm thrives in perfect balance.

**Laozi** said:
The world’s right and wrong have no fixed standard,
Each age upholds what it likes and rejects what it dislikes.
Those who seek what is right
Do not seek **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,
But what aligns with themselves.
To reject what is wrong
Is not to reject evil,
But to reject what opposes the heart.

Now, if I wish to choose what is right and dwell in it,
To choose what is wrong and discard it,
I do not know what the world calls right and wrong.

Hence, governing a great state is like poaching small fish—
Do not stir them, lest they spoil.

To pursue what aligns with others,
If words are true yet actions grow distant,
Or if the body is near yet plans are made from afar—
This will surely invite suspicion.

Now, if I wish to correct myself and await the responses of others,
How can I know what the world will use to measure me?

If I rush along with the customs,
I am like one fleeing the rain—
There is no place untouched by dampness.

To desire emptiness yet fail to embody it,
Or to not seek emptiness yet naturally attain it—
This is what one desires and will surely achieve.

Thus, those who grasp the **Dao/Way**,
Like a cart axle that does not move itself,
Yet with the wheel reaches a thousand miles,
Turning through endless plains—

Hence, the sage embodies the **Dao/Way** and returns to its origin,
Does not act to transform but waits for transformation,
Moves yet does nothing—

The distinctions of names and ranks, the debates of right and wrong,
The separation of good and evil—
These are the **Dao/Way** of governance,
Not seeking absolute justice but taking one’s own perspective.

To call wrong right and evil good,
Yet hope for names and ranks to be correct and laws to be clear—
This is difficult indeed.

Only when one corrects oneself and awaits the responses of others,
Without abandoning absolute justice,
Then, like a cart on land or a boat on water,
One travels without obstruction—
How could there be any falling into imbalance?

**Laozi** said:
He who often wages war and frequently wins,
His state shall perish.
Often waging war exhausts the people,
Frequent victories breed arrogance in the ruler—
With an arrogant ruler leading exhausted people,
How could his state not perish?

When the ruler is arrogant, he grows reckless,
Recklessness leads to exhausting the people,
When the people are exhausted, they harbor resentment,
Resentment leads to extreme measures—
If both ruler and people reach extremes yet the state does not perish,
This has never occurred.

Thus, when achievements are complete, the ruler retires—
This is the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.
Victories are not constant; defeat follows—
This is the **Dao/Way** of reversals.
How can one seek frequent victories in war?

When the ruler prevails yet grows arrogant,
And the people are exhausted yet still wage war—
The axe of ruin for his state.

War is like fire—
If not restrained, it will burn itself out.
Is this not a warning?

King Ping asked Wenzi:
I have heard that you learned the **Dao/Way** from Lao Dan.
Even if the wise have the **Dao/Way**,
Yet encounter an age of licentious chaos,
With the authority of one man,
How could they transform the people who have long been in disorder?

Wenzi replied:
**Virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,
Rectify evil to establish what is right,
Stabilize chaos to bring order,
Transform licentiousness and decay into simplicity—
Pure **virtue/power** revives,
And the world is at peace.
This depends on one person.

The sovereign is the teacher of the people,
The ruler is the model for the subjects.
If the ruler is beautiful, the people will emulate beauty,
If the ruler has **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,
Then the people will have **virtue/ren** and **righteousness**,
And if the people have **virtue/ren** and **righteousness**,
Then there will be no age of licentious chaos.

Accumulating **virtue/power** leads to kingship,
Accumulating resentment leads to ruin,
Piling stones forms mountains,
Gathering water forms seas—
Without accumulation, how could anything be achieved?

Those who accumulate **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,
Heaven aids them, Earth assists them,
Ghosts and spirits support them,
Phoenix birds hover in their courts,
Qilin roam their outskirts,
Qiantong dragons dwell in their marshes.

Thus, to rule the world with the **Dao/Way**,
Is to embody the world’s **virtue/power**;
To rule the world without the **Dao/Way**,
Is to become the world’s thief.

To make the world your enemy with one man’s power,
Even if you desire longevity, it cannot be attained.

Emperor Yao and Shun flourished through this,
King Jie and Zhou’s last tyrant perished through this.

King Ping said:
I respectfully hear your words.

Wenzi, from the family of Ji, lived near Bo,
Long studied under Laozi,
And upon hearing the **Dao/Way**, became widely learned.
King Ping invited him and asked about the **Dao/Way**,
Wenzi answered with *accumulating virtue leads to kingship, accumulating resentment leads to ruin*.
Emperor Yao and Shun flourished through this,
King Jie and Zhou’s last tyrant perished through this.

King Ping said:
I respectfully hear your words.

By this standard,
If King Ping had resolve to govern,
Why did he not cultivate **virtue/power** and pardon resentment,
Yet instead he trusted slander and harbored suspicion,
And executed the Wu clan?
This is why Wenzi left Chu for Yue.

Zi Chu urged Wu to attack Chu,
And suffered the humiliation of being flogged after death—
Great indeed.

Rulers of states,
Can resentment not be pardoned?

**Chapter Six of *The True Classic of the Mysterious Origin* – *The Upper Virtue Section*
Compiled by Master Du Daojian of Nangu Valley**

**Laozi says:**
The ruler is the heart of the state.
When the heart is ordered, all limbs are at ease;
When the heart is disturbed, all limbs are in chaos.

Thus, when one’s own person is ordered,
The limbs support one another;
When a state is ordered,
The ruler and ministers forget their distinctions.

**Virtue is singular yet twofold:**
Nurturing all things is the **virtue/power** of Heaven,
Cherishing the people is the **virtue/power** of the ruler.

The ruler is the heart of the state—
When the ruler has **virtue/power**, the heart expands, the body grows robust,
**Qi** remains unruffled, and the person governs itself.
To govern a state is like governing one’s own person—
When ruler and ministers are at ease,
How could the state fail to be ordered?

Thus it is said:
*The Upper Virtue does not cling to virtue,*
Yet this is virtue—
Not boasting of it as virtue,
Yet truly possessing it.

**Laozi says:**
He learned from Changcong,
Observing the tongue yet guarding softness,
Gazing upward at the house’s rafters,
Retreating to gaze upon the river,
Studying his shadow to know how to follow behind—
Thus the sage abides in emptiness and follows,
Ever yielding yet never leading,
Like kindling piled—
The fire that burns last stands highest.

Changcong was a sage of antiquity.
Laozi learned from Changcong,
As Confucius learned from Laozi.
When the **Dao/Way** is seen, the spirit resonates in harmony—
Thus he could observe the tongue and guard softness.
Studying his shadow to know how to follow behind,
The sage thus follows in emptiness and non-action,
Not contending, not daring to lead—
This is called *Upper Virtue*.

**Laozi says:**
A clanging bell destroys itself with sound,
A candle consumes itself with light.
The tiger’s stripes invite arrows,
The monkey’s agility invites confrontation—
Thus the bold die by their strength,
The eloquent are ensnared by their cleverness,
Knowing through cleverness yet failing to know *not* knowing through cleverness.

Thus, those skilled in one ability,
Sharp in one argument,
Can be led by devious speech,
Yet cannot be broadly responded to.
What is noble is to have **virtue/power**,
Not to have much cleverness.
Excessive cleverness issues from oneself
And returns upon itself—
Few escape self-harm.
The tiger’s stripes invite arrows,
The monkey’s agility invites confrontation—
The scholar’s boldness dies by strength,
His cleverness is ensnared by eloquence—
This is as it should be.

Only those who do not know through cleverness
Yet know *not* knowing through cleverness
Are not confined to one thing,
And their responses are broad.

**Laozi says:**
The **Dao/Way** is formless in its essence—
It cannot be seen, cannot be heard—
Called *profound and obscure*.
*Profound and obscure* is how the **Dao/Way** is spoken of,
Yet it is not the **Dao/Way** itself.

The **Dao/Way** is inward reflection—
Thus one does not slightly awaken,
Nor greatly delude,
Nor slightly enlighten,
Nor greatly dull.
One does not discern in flowing waters,
But discerns in still pools—
For its essence is inwardly preserved, still, and not externally agitated.

The moon wanes when the sun is full—
Yin cannot sustain yang.
When the sun rises, stars vanish—
They cannot contend for brightness.
The end cannot overpower the root,
The branch cannot exceed the trunk.
What is above is heavy, what is below is light—
Its overturning is inevitable.

One pool does not hold two dragons,
One female does not mate with two males—
One is fixed; two contend.
Jade in the mountains makes grasses and trees lush,
Pearls in the depths keep the shores from withering.
The earthworm, lacking strong bones or sharp claws,
Eats the withered above and drinks from the Yellow Springs below—
Its **qi** is singular.

The **Dao/Way** is formless in its essence—
Thus it can move in parallel.
Things, with form as their function,
Cannot coexist.
Formless in essence, it is singular and fixed.
With form as function, they are dual and contend.

Yet there are degrees of great and small,
Distinctions of ruler and minister.
When the ruler embraces the **Dao/Way** and holds **virtue/power**,
He does not claim possession of it—
This is why the **Dao/Way** is vast,
And **virtue/power** endures.

Who dares contend with strength?
Clarity as brightness—
A cup of water reveals the pupil.
Turbidity as harm—
The Yellow River obscures Mount Tai.
Orchids and osmanthus need no praise to be fragrant;
A boat floats on rivers and seas—
It does not sink for want of riders.
The gentleman walks the **Dao/Way**—
He does not halt for want of recognition.
This is the nature of things.

To enter purity from impurity is to invite constraint and humiliation;
To enter impurity from purity is to invite ruin.
Heaven’s two **qi** form the rainbow,
Earth’s two **qi** cause leakage and concealment,
Man’s two **qi** bring illness.
Yin and yang cannot persist—
Now winter, now summer;
The moon does not know day,
The sun does not know night.

Wide rivers breed great fish,
Tall mountains grow towering trees,
Broad lands nurture deep **virtue/power**.

Thus fish cannot be caught without bait,
Beasts cannot be summoned without traps.
Mountains harbor fierce beasts—
The forests are left uncut;
Gardens harbor venomous insects—
The melons and hemp are left unharvested;
States have worthy ministers—
They resolve conflicts a thousand *li* away.

Those who master the Dao move like a wheel turning in its hub—
not driven by themselves, yet carrying all to a thousand *li*,
ending only to begin anew, revolving in the boundless source.

Thus, to raise the crooked alongside the straight—
what difference does it make?
To raise the straight alongside the crooked—
do not comply.

Clear water mirrors shadows,
a clear mind discerns all things—
this is the nature of illumination.
When muddied, it grows dim.

The virtuous and the petty cannot coexist—
their forces cannot stand together.
Winter’s cold and summer’s heat do not run concurrently—
if they do, calamities arise.
If forces clash, misfortune follows.

Yet though the petty may hold office,
should the virtuous withdraw because the Dao cannot be practiced?
There is a bird about to arrive—
set the net and await it.
He who catches the bird is the one who set the net’s eye.

If you set a net for one eye,
you will never catch a bird.
Thus some matters cannot be preordained,
some things cannot be foreseen.
Hence the Sage nurtures the Dao and waits for the time.

To catch fish, first clear the valley;
to summon birds, first grow the trees.
Water gathers, fish assemble;
trees flourish, birds congregate.
Those who catch fish do not drag them from the depths,
those who catch monkeys do not carry them up the trees—
they simply let them come where they are drawn.

The path you tread is shallow,
yet you must wait for what you do not tread to move forward.
The mind’s knowledge is limited,
yet you must wait for what it does not know to become clear.

When rivers dry, valleys empty;
when hills level, abysses fill.
When lips perish, teeth grow cold.
When the Yellow River’s waters recede,
the land lies bare upon the mountains.

Still water becomes clear,
clear water becomes level,
level water reveals all forms—
forms cannot coexist,
thus they can be measured.

To know the use of what is useful,
yet not know the use of what is useless—
such a one cannot speak of governance.

To govern a state depends on one person;
without one, many cannot rule.
To seek worthy ministers without first nurturing scholars—
is this possible?

Thus the Sage nurtures the Dao and waits for the time.
When worthy men arise, none refuse to serve.
What makes leaves fall? The wind shakes them.
What makes water murky? Things disturb it.
A jade’s smoothness comes from the whetstone’s work,
a blade’s sharpness comes from the grindstone’s force.
The gnat and the steed both travel a thousand *li*—
yet the gnat does not fly,
the steed lacks provisions and does not starve.

When the clever hare is caught, the hunting dogs are boiled;
when the high birds are exhausted, the fine bows are hidden.
Success brings retreat—
this is the Way of Heaven.

Anger arises from what is not anger,
action comes from what is not action.
To see what is unseen,
to hear what is unheard—
then you perceive what is seen,
then you hear what is heard.

Birds return to their nests,
hares flee to their burrows,
foxes die on their birth mounds,
cicadas cling to trees—
each returns to its origin.

The Dao can be walked alone,
but affairs cannot be monopolized.

A man may run a hundred *li* and then tire,
but with a good horse, a thousand *li* is possible.
Anger from what is not anger—
thus Wen and Wu brought peace to the people.
Action from what is not action—
thus Yao and Shun established the age of settled governance.

If a ruler governs well and uses men wisely,
who among the people would not return to him?

Fire and water repel each other,
yet the cauldron mediates between them.
The five flavors blend—
bone and flesh love each other,
yet slanderers intervene,
and father and son become endangered.

Dogs and pigs eat without discrimination,
growing ever fatter—
yet they approach death.

The phoenix soars to the heights, yet none can summon it;
the axe’s blade is fixed to its handle, yet it cannot strike itself.
The eye sees a hundred paces away,
yet cannot see its own corner.

Build high and it becomes a mountain—
stable and not precarious.
Build low and it becomes a marsh—
fish and turtles gather there.

Ditches overflow in floods,
dry up in droughts.
The Yellow River’s source is deep and never exhausted.

The deaf lack ears, yet their eyes cannot be covered—
they are precise in sight.
The blind lack eyes, yet their ears cannot be covered—
they are precise in hearing.

Muddy water can wash my feet,
but clear water can wash my headgear.
Silk begins as raw silk—
sometimes it becomes a cap,
sometimes a belt.
The cap is worn on the head,
the belt is wrapped around the feet.

No man is always right,
no thing is always wrong.
Qi in harmony unites,
qi in conflict separates.

Fire ascends, water descends—
the cauldron mediates between them,
and its function is fulfilled.

If the father is kind and the son dutiful,
yet slanderers intervene,
then the grudges of the Big Dipper and the Southern Cross arise.

Dogs and pigs grow fat and approach death,
the phoenix soars high and none can summon it.

Clear water washes the headgear,
muddy water washes the feet—
if one cannot purify oneself,
yet blames others for filth,
should this not be examined?

Gold’s nature overcomes wood—
one blade cannot harm an entire forest.
Earth’s nature overcomes water—
one handful cannot dam a river.
Water’s nature overcomes fire—
one sip cannot extinguish a cartload of firewood.

Winter thunder, summer hail—
cold and heat do not alter their course.
Frost and snow fall thickly,
yet melt at dawn.

To tilt is to risk falling,
to lean is to risk toppling,
to assist is to risk overreaching,
to moisten is to risk rain.

Orchids and osmanthus bloom fragrant,
yet cannot endure frost.
Toads avoid weapons,
their lifespan ends at the fifth month’s full moon.

When essence is wasted, the body weakens,
when flowers bloom out of season, they cannot be eaten.

Generation and destruction, restraint and domination—
each has its fixed portion.
To bear great burdens with little strength
is to invite reversal and subjugation.

Wood overcomes metal,
water overcomes earth,
fire overcomes water—
yet this is not their inherent nature.

Winter thunder, summer hail—
these are not their proper times.
Even a morning’s duration is brief—
how can one not measure oneself?

The tongue against the teeth—
which wears first?
The bowstring against the arrow—
which snaps first?

What bends the shadow is the form,
what muddies the echo is the sound.

To treat the dying as the sick—
this is difficult for a good physician.
To counsel the doomed as the living—
this is impossible for loyal advisors.

The one who makes the flute play and the artisan refine the pipes—
though they follow the proper rhythm, they cannot make the music resound.
The ruler’s form is lost when they are constrained.

The deaf cannot sing to find joy,
the blind cannot observe to engage with others.
One who walks in the forest cannot follow a straight path,
and one who travels in peril cannot step on a plumb line.

The sea produces great things,
yet when placed in an unsuitable land or dependent on the wrong people,
it is difficult indeed.

The rigid tooth breaks first,
the stiff arrow snaps first.

To treat the dying as the sick—
this is difficult for a good physician.
To counsel the doomed as the living—
this is impossible for loyal advisors.

If the ruler does not follow the Dao,
yet the minister forces it upon him,
with schemes born of divided hearts—
how can success be achieved?

The sun does not rise in pairs,
the fox does not have two kings,
the divine dragon does not mate,
the fierce beast does not gather in herds,
the ravenous crow does not fly in twos.

Without the handle, the parasol cannot shield,
without the axle, the wheel cannot chase swiftness—
yet even a well-made parasol and wheel are not enough to rely upon.

To draw the bow and shoot—
without the string, the arrow cannot fly,
and the act of releasing the arrow is but one-tenth of the skill of shooting.

A hungry horse in the stable makes no sound,
but when fodder is placed beside it,
the struggle for it begins.

A three-inch pipe cannot hold the wind,
yet the heavens cannot be filled.
A ten-stone vessel may overflow,
but a hundred dou is sufficient.

If one cuts along the plumb line, it will not stray,
if one weighs with the balance, it will not err.
To apply ancient laws by analogy—
sometimes they succeed, sometimes they fail.
The use of standards and measures—
sometimes they are applied, sometimes not.
To act rightly is called discernment;
to act wrongly is called chaos.

The sun does not rise in pairs,
the divine dragon does not mate,
the fierce beast does not gather in herds—
how much more so for humans?

The handle stretches the canopy,
the axle turns the wheel—
this is the Dao of ruler and minister aiding each other.

A hungry horse struggles for fodder;
rewards must not be given recklessly.
To cut along the plumb line is to judge without error;
ancient laws and standards must be applied at the proper time—
it depends on those who wield them.

The farmer labors while the noble is nourished;
the foolish speak while the wise choose.

When things are clear before one,
treat them as jade and stone—
when they are obscure,
keep their counsel.
A hundred stars’ light
is not as bright as one moon’s,
and ten windows open
are not as bright as one door.

The viper cannot be a foot,
the tiger cannot be a wing.

Now, if one has a six-foot mat,
lying down, one can easily step over it,
but standing, even the most skilled cannot leap over it—
the application of force differs.

The assistant at sacrifice gets to taste,
the one who breaks up a fight gets injured,
and he who shelters beneath an unlucky tree
may be struck by thunder and lightning.

The sun and moon wish to shine,
yet floating clouds obscure them;
the river wishes to be clear,
yet sand and mud defile it;
the clump of orchids wishes to flourish,
yet autumn winds wither them;
human nature wishes to be balanced,
yet desires corrupt it.
To walk through dust and yet avoid being stained—
this is impossible.

A golden tortoise pendant,
the worthy wear as an ornament;
fertile soil spread across the land,
the capable use to grow rich.

Thus, to give gold and jade to the weak
is not as good as giving them a simple scroll.

If the farmer does not labor,
the noble has no means to be nourished.
If the noble does not govern,
how can the farmer be at peace?

The serpent has no feet,
the tiger has no wings—
one cannot have both.

Floating clouds obscure the sun—
the fault lies not with oneself.
Desires corrupt nature—
the illness is not of the person.

A hollow hub stands with thirty spokes,
each pulling straight toward its notch,
yet if one spoke alone were to enter,
all others would be abandoned—
how could it reach near or far?

Citrons grow in their native soil,
reeds grow in their clumps,
beasts with similar feet gather to roam,
birds with similar wings gather to soar.

To observe all nine regions of the land
without a thousand-li journey,
without the source of governance and teaching,
and yet wish to rule the people—
this is difficult.

The cunning gain their prey,
the swift strike their mark.

Thus, great whiteness seems like shame,
vast virtue seems like insufficiency.

The noble has wine,
the petty man beats his pot—
though it may not be praised,
it can still be despised.

The Supreme Polarity stands at the center,
relying on the eight ministers before it can be established.
The hub of the wheel is hollow within,
depending on the spokes before it can move.

The Son of Heaven stands at the center of the world,
placed above all people,
yet without the source of governance and teaching,
how can he rule?
Only by maintaining proper position and dignity,
with officials fulfilling their roles,
can the realm be governed without descending from the hall.

Human nature prefers loose clothing and hanging silks,
yet when threatened, one immediately dons armor—
this is to abandon what is inconvenient
for what is advantageous.

Thirty spokes share one hub,
each straight toward its notch,
yet none can enter another—
just as ministers each guard their duties.

The skilled user of people is like the insect’s feet,
many yet not harming one another,
like the tongue and teeth,
firm and soft, grinding yet not destroying.

Stone is born firm,
orchid is born fragrant—
if held young, their virtue grows clearer with time.

To support and to lift,
to decline and to yield,
to gain and to lose,
to assent and to refuse—
these differ by thousands of miles.

There is a method to every action,
and nothing fails to succeed.
There is a way to use people,
and none are beyond aid.

The spokes of the wheel each align with their notch,
illustrating how officials must each hold their posts.

Though the insect’s feet are many, they do not harm one another—
this is because they are used appropriately.

Stone is firm, orchid is fragrant—
if each is used according to its nature,
then the wise become clear,
the strong become powerful,
and success is achieved.

The twice-born do not gain,
flowers that bloom too early fall without frost.

To soil the standard,
to powder the brow,
to have a rotting rat beneath the ancestral altar,
to be choked by smoke in the hall—
to enter water and hate being wet,
to embrace stench and seek fragrance—
even the most skilled cannot craft perfection.

Winter ice can be shattered,
summer wood can be bound—
opportune moments are hard to find yet easy to lose.

When wood is in full vigor,
one can cut it all day and it regrows,
but when autumn frost descends,
it withers in a single night.

When the target is taut and the arrow is drawn,
when forests are dense and axes enter—
this is not summoned by will,
but by the nature of things.

A nursing puppy bites a tiger,
a crouching hen strikes a weasel—
when favor is bestowed,
it does not measure their strength.

Those who wait for profit to rescue the drowning will surely drown them with their own greed.
A boat can float or sink—fools do not know where to draw the line.

A swift steed urged forward will not advance,
pulled back will not stop—
a ruler who does not seek the Dao in governance
will find no steady path.

Opportune moments are hard to grasp yet easy to lose,
the people easily fall into hardship but rarely recover.

Thus, things that regenerate cannot be fully seized,
flowers that bloom too early fall without frost—
the times are not favorable.

When the target is taut and the arrow is drawn,
when forests are dense and axes enter—
this is the work of circumstance.

A nursing puppy bites a tiger,
a crouching hen strikes a weasel—
driven by instinct, not strength.

A rotting boat still carries its load,
a weary steed driven to death—
can the people endure further suffering?

Water, though level, must have waves,
a balance, though true, must have slight deviation,
a ruler’s measure, though precise, must have flaws.

Without the compass and square, one cannot define the square and round,
without the plumb line and level, one cannot rectify the crooked and straight.
Yet even those who use the compass and square
must have the mind to wield them rightly.

Tai Mountain’s height, doubled, is still unseen,
yet the finest autumn hair can be discerned—
so too with hidden truths.

Fire in bamboo does not ignite without kindling,
water in the earth does not emerge without digging.
An arrow’s speed does not exceed two *li*,
yet a limping tortoise, step by step, crosses a thousand.

Heap soil without end, and hills will rise.
Stand by the river wanting fish—
better to return and weave nets.

A bow must first be tuned before seeking strength,
a horse must first be broken before seeking excellence,
a man must first earn trust before seeking skill.

A master smith cannot melt wood,
a skilled artisan cannot cleave ice—
some things defy effort.
How can the virtuous not take heed?

If men cannot cross the river,
you cannot force the river to stand still.
If a pot does not say it is guiltless,
it will not fall into the well.

Water, though level, must have waves,
a balance, though true, must have deviation—
how much more must the heart be cautious?

The gentleman’s rites and propriety,
like the craftsman’s compass and square,
are tools to measure conduct.

A bow must first be tuned before seeking strength,
a horse must first be broken before seeking excellence.
If a man is not first trusted,
how can his skill be summoned?

Thus the gentleman acts only as he can,
and does not act where he cannot prevail.

Those who reproach my conduct seek my company,
those who praise my goods seek my trade—
a single chess move does not reveal wisdom,
a single plucked string does not stir sorrow.

Now take a burning ember—
touch it, and your fingers blister,
yet stand ten paces away, and you are unharmed.
Like qi gathered differently, some bear glory,
others bear sorrow.

Silk above, hemp below—
the high and low must align.

Great trees have deep roots,
tall mountains have firm foundations.
Bitter words bring profit,
bitter medicine cures disease.

Those who reproach my conduct seek my company—
the gentleman follows righteousness.
Those who praise my goods seek my trade—
the petty man follows profit.

Man’s fortune cannot be excessive—
clothing need not be extravagant.
Great trees have deep roots,
tall mountains have firm foundations—
when the people prosper, the state flourishes.

The *Laozi* says:
A drum does not store sound, yet it makes sound.
A mirror does not hold form, yet it reflects form.
Metal and stone make sound only when struck,
flutes and pipes make music only when blown.

Thus the sage holds inward, does not lead others,
responds when things come, answers when things arrive.
Heaven’s motion never ceases,
yet it returns to its beginning—
thus it endures.

A wheel turns where it should,
thus it travels far.
Heaven’s motion never strays—
thus there is no excess.

Heaven’s qi descends, earth’s qi ascends,
yin and yang intermingle—
all things are harmonized.
When the gentleman acts, the petty man fades—
this is the Way of Heaven and Earth.

When Heaven’s qi does not descend,
earth’s qi does not ascend,
yin and yang do not flow—
all things wither.
The petty man gains power,
the gentleman fades,
the five grains do not grow,
virtue is hidden within.

The Way of Heaven: it gathers the abundant and aids the scarce.
The Way of Earth: it reduces the high and raises the low.
The Way of Spirits: it humbles the proud and exalts the lowly.
The Way of Man: the many do not share.
The Way of the Sage: though low, none can surpass him.

The heart that does not store things can respond to things,
the drum that does not store sound can answer sound—
if it rings without being struck, it is unnatural.

Thus the sage holds inward, does not lead others,
but responds as needed.

When Heaven and Earth intermingle,
all things are harmonized—
this is the time of bright gatherings,
when the gentleman acts and thrives.

If one reverses this,
then it is the petty man’s day.

Only the sage stands high while listening low,
yet does not grow full of himself,
and does not seek to rise above.

When Heaven is bright, the sun shines,
and only then can it illuminate the four quarters.
When the ruler is enlightened, the ministers are enlightened,
and only then is the realm at peace.
When the realm has four enlightened corners,
only then can it endure.

To enlighten those who enlighten others—
this is to enlighten their transformations.

The Way of Heaven is *wen* (pattern),
the Way of Earth is *li* (principle),
one unites them in harmony,
time governs their work—
thus all things are completed.
This is called the Dao.

The Great Dao is broad and near—
cultivate it in oneself, and virtue becomes true.
Cultivate it in things, and virtue is unbroken.

Heaven covers all things,
bestowing virtue and nourishing them,
giving without taking—
thus all things return to their spirit.

To give without taking is the highest virtue—
thus it is called virtue.

Nothing is higher than Heaven,
nothing is lower than the marsh.
Heaven is high, the marsh is low—
the sage follows this,
and order is established.

Earth bears all things and sustains them,
giving and taking—
thus bones and flesh return to it.

To give and take is the lower virtue—
yet even the lower virtue, if not lost,
is still virtue.

Earth supports Heaven, thus it is stable.
Earth is stable, thus all things take form.
Earth is vast and thick, thus all things gather.
Stable and thick, it bears all things,
vast and deep, it contains all things.

Earth’s foundation is deep and firm,
thus waters gather within.
Earth’s Way is square and broad,
thus it endures.
The sage follows this—
virtue contains all things.

The Sovereign follows the Way of Heaven,
the Minister follows the Way of Earth.
Heaven is exalted, Earth is humble—
thus the distinction between Sovereign and Minister is fixed.

When the Sovereign is enlightened, the Minister is enlightened,
illuminating the four quarters—
is this not the radiance of Yao,
who brought clarity to all under Heaven?

Thus, to model Heaven and emulate Earth,
to complete all things—
this is the Way.

To nourish and give without taking is the highest virtue.
To give and take is lower virtue indeed.

Yin is difficult for Yang—
when all things flourish, Yang subdues Yin.
Yang serves Yin—
all things rest in tranquility.

When things flourish, none lack sustenance;
when things rest, none lack joy.
When all things rejoice, all things are well-ordered.

If Yin harms things, Yang bends in retreat;
when Yin advances and Yang withdraws,
the petty gain influence,
the virtuous avoid harm—
this is the Way of Heaven.

When Yang-qi moves, all things relax and find their place—
thus the sage follows the Way of Yang.

To follow things, things will follow in return;
to oppose things, things will oppose in return—
thus one does not lose the nature of things.

When the marshes overflow, all things grow in due measure;
when the marshes dry, all things wither in due measure.
Thus, when rains fail, the land is barren and lost,
Yang ascends then descends again—
thus it becomes the master of all things.

It does not cling to permanence,
and so it can end and begin anew,
end and begin anew,
and so endure forever.
To endure forever,
it becomes the Mother of all under Heaven.

Yang-qi accumulates before it can bestow,
Yin-qi gathers before it can transform—
nothing transforms without first accumulating.
Thus the sage is cautious in what it gathers.

When Yang extinguishes Yin, all things grow fat;
when Yin extinguishes Yang, all things wither.
Thus, when kings and lords uphold the Way of Yang,
all things flourish;
when they uphold the Way of Yin,
all under Heaven perishes.

Yang does not descend to Yin—
all things cannot form,
the Sovereign does not descend to the Minister—
virtuous transformation does not spread.
Thus, when the Sovereign descends to the Minister,
there is wisdom and clarity;
when not, there is darkness and deafness.

Yang gives life, Yin brings death—
thus the virtuous cherish life,
the petty embrace death.

When kings and lords uphold the Way of Yang,
all things flourish;
when they uphold the Way of Yin,
all under Heaven perishes.

Yang is noble, descending to Yin—
thus when the Sovereign descends to the Minister,
there is wisdom and the nation is well-ordered;
when not, there is darkness and deafness,
and virtuous transformation does not spread.

When the sun rises from Earth,
all things multiply and thrive,
kings and lords dwell above the people,
illuminating virtue and morality.
When the sun sets into Earth,
all things rest and hide,
the petty dwell above the people,
and all things flee in concealment.

When thunder moves, all things awaken;
when rain nourishes, all things are released—
the great act similarly.

The movement of Yin and Yang has fixed seasons,
the great act without exhausting things.

Thunder shakes the Earth, all things relax;
wind sways the trees, grasses and woods wither.
The great act by abandoning vice and embracing goodness—
the people do not flee far,
thus the people have choices to depart or stay.
Departure is more extreme,
approach is less so.

When wind does not move, fire does not rise,
when the great do not speak, the petty have no words.
When fire rises, it must await kindling;
when the great speak, it must be with truth.

With truth and sincerity, what cannot succeed?
Deep waters hold the earth,
mounds on mountains, valleys in the lowlands—
when Yang-qi is strong, it transforms into Yin;
when Yin-qi is strong, it transforms into Yang.
Thus desire cannot be fully satisfied,
joy cannot be fully indulged.

Anger without harsh words,
wrath without color—
this is called calculated gain.

Fire ascends in flame, water flows downward—
the sage’s Way seeks its kind:
the sage embraces Yang, bringing harmony to all under Heaven;
the sage embraces Yin, drowning all under Heaven.

Is Heaven’s sun the people’s Sovereign?
When the sun rises from Earth,
kings and lords dwell above the people,
all things multiply and thrive.
When the sun sets into Earth,
the petty dwell above the people,
all things flee in concealment.

The movement of Yin and Yang has fixed seasons,
thus the year does not disrupt its times.
The great act without exhausting things,
thus the people do not flee far.

Things pushed to extremes transform—
desire cannot be fully satisfied.

Yin and Yang are Heaven’s—
order and chaos depend on humanity.

Laozi said:
Thin accumulations become thick,
low accumulations become high.
The virtuous strive daily to achieve brilliance,
the petty rush daily to reach disgrace.

Though unseen in its waxing and waning,
thus one pursues goodness as if it might slip away,
and past evils as if they were omens of ruin.
If one turns toward goodness,
even past mistakes bring no blame;
if one does not turn toward goodness,
even loyalty cannot avert calamity.
Thus blaming others is not as good as blaming oneself;
seeking faults in others is not as good as seeking them within.

Sounds are self-summoned,
kinds seek their own,
names are self-claimed,
positions are self-assumed—
none of it is without cause.

Wielding sharpness to pierce,
wielding blades to strike—
why blame others?

Thus the virtuous are cautious of trifles.

All things bear Yin and embrace Yang,
converging qi to form harmony.
Harmony resides at the center—
thus grains grow in the heart of wood,
seeds in the pods of grass,
eggs and embryos in the center,
those without eggs or embryos
take time to gestate.

When Earth is level, water does not flow;
when light and heavy are balanced, the scale does not tilt—
the generation and transformation of things
are moved by response.

Yin and Yang respond to form harmony.
Thus all things are born,
Sovereign and Minister unite in the Middle Way—
thus all the people are at peace.

Therefore the virtuous harmonize their heart-mind,
striving daily to achieve brilliance.
The petty drown in Heaven’s harmony,
rushing daily to reach disgrace.

Thus the virtuous are cautious of trifles,
rectifying their hearts and seeking within themselves.
If I do not blame others,
others will not blame me—
is this not so?

Laozi said:
Mountains reach their height,
and clouds and rains arise there.
Waters reach their depth,
and dragons and serpents are born.
The virtuous perfect their Way,
and virtue flows forth.

Those with hidden virtue
will surely have manifest reward,
those with secret deeds
will surely have renowned name.
Planting millet does not yield barley,
planting resentment yields no gratitude.
To do good unseen is the highest good.
To do evil unseen is the highest evil.

Mountains conceal clouds to form rain and dew,
marshes conceal waters to birth dragons and serpents—
the virtuous harbor their Way,
and its blessings flow to the world.

Those with hidden virtue will surely have manifest reward—this is the blessing of Heaven.
Those with secret deeds will surely have renowned name—this is the esteem of humanity.
Only those with Heaven’s virtue know it.

**Chapter Seven of the *Tongxuan Zhenjing* (Continuation of the *True Scripture of the Perfected Dao*), Compiled by Master Du Daojian of Nangu, *Weiming* ("Mystic Clarity")**

Laozi said:
The Dao can be weak, yet strong,
soft, yet firm,
shadowed, yet bright,
enfolding yet expansive,
responding without fixed measure.
Shallow knowledge grasps its surface,
deep knowledge penetrates its core.
Coarse knowledge clings to its form,
refined knowledge perceives its essence.
Yet what is known as knowledge is ignorance,
and what is unknown as ignorance is true knowledge.
Who can fathom the formless form?

Thus all under Heaven know that goodness is goodness—
yet this is not true goodness.
The wise do not speak,
speakers lack wisdom.
The mystically bright—
this is the Dao.

See not with the eyes,
hear not with the ears,
but grasp it from Heaven and root it in the heart—
thus one can enfold Heaven and Earth,
respond without fixed measure,
not by cleverness or forceful seeking.
Only by knowing what is not known,
acting without contrivance,
speaking without words
does one attain it.

Wenzi asked:
Can one speak of the Dao in subtle ways?
Laozi replied:
Why not? Only to say what must be said.
Those who say what must be said
do not speak with words.
The fisherman wades into the water,
the hunter chases the beast—
not for their own delight.
Thus the ultimate speech transcends speech,
the ultimate action transcends action.
Shallow thinkers contend for trifles.

Speech has its root,
affairs have their master.
Only the ignorant
remain unrecognized by me.
The Dao cannot be spoken—
yet when spoken, it manifests things.
Words are not the Dao.
Yet without words, it remains unclear.

When Wenzi asked if one could speak of the Dao in subtle ways,
and Laozi answered that only knowing what must be said is possible,
this is speech without speaking,
and speaking without speech.
The fisherman and hunter—
these are those who do not know what must be said,
clinging to words and fixated on things,
thus their contests are for trifles.
How can one find those who transcend speech and action
to converse with them?

Wenzi asked:
Does governing a state also have its principles?
Laozi replied:
Now, those who pull a cart,
call out *"Left!"* in front,
and the rear responds in kind—
this is the song of urging the oxen forward.
Though the melodies of Zheng, Wei, Hu, and Chu differ,
none match this cart-puller’s true intent.
Governing a state relies on ritual propriety,
not on eloquent debate.
The more laws multiply, the more thieves and robbers arise.
Those who rule a state are like Heaven and Earth:
Heaven does not speak, yet the four seasons proceed;
Earth does not utter, yet all things flourish.

When Wenzi asked of the principles of governance,
Laozi answered with the cart-puller’s song—
front calls, rear echoes—
just as the Sage aligns with the natural order before Heaven,
and follows the seasons after Heaven.
Governing relies on ritual propriety,
not on the superficial brilliance of words.
To ignore the fundamental order
while multiplying laws
is to provide thieves with legal pretexts
and harm the people.

Laozi said:
The Dao has no fixed form yet can be the fixed form.
Like mountains and forests yielding timber,
yet timber does not equal mountains and forests;
mountains and forests do not equal clouds and rains,
clouds and rains do not equal yin and yang,
yin and yang do not equal harmony,
harmony does not equal the Dao.
The Dao is the state of form without form,
the image without image—
that which cannot be fully expressed,
yet between Heaven and Earth
can be shaped and transformed.
The Dao has no fixed form—
things conform and take shape accordingly.
To observe mountains and forests transforming
into the harmony of clouds, rains, yin, and yang—
then one knows that all formless, imageless things
between Heaven and Earth
can be shaped and transformed.
This is the Dao’s divine mystery.

Laozi said:
The Sage establishes teachings and administers governance,
ever mindful of their beginning and end,
and how they shape destiny.
Thus when the people know writing, virtue declines;
when they know calculation, benevolence declines;
when they know contracts, trust declines;
when they know mechanical arts, sincerity declines.
The zither does not sound,
yet its twenty-five strings each resonate with their own note.
The axle does not turn of itself,
yet its thirty spokes each exert their strength to revolve.
Strings must have slack and tight
to produce melody,
wheels must have labor and rest
to travel far.
To make the resonant silent,
to make the turning still—
this is the way.
When governing principles diverge above and below,
easy governance becomes chaos.
High station with great Dao brings fortune,
great affairs with small Dao bring misfortune.
Small virtue harms righteousness,
small goodness harms the Dao,
petty debate harms governance,
harsh scrutiny harms virtue.
The greatest rectitude is not precarious,
thus the people are easily guided.
The most refined governance is effortless,
thus the subjects do not rebel.
The utmost loyalty returns to simplicity,
thus the people harbor no deceit.

The Sage establishes teachings and administers governance,
not to seize for oneself—
but to observe their beginning and end,
and act where no action is needed.
To know writing, calculation, contracts, and mechanical arts
is to have one’s mind fixed on affairs,
thus virtue, benevolence, trust, and sincerity decline.

The ruler relies on ministers to govern,
just as the zither needs strings to sound,
and wheels need spokes to travel far.
To grasp the essential and employ the great—
then there will be no ungoverned world.

Laozi said:
When the principle of *"relative seating"* is established,
the common people grumble.
When the decree of *"reducing titles"* is proclaimed,
meritorious ministers rebel.
Thus those who focus on legal records
do not grasp the roots of order and chaos;
those who train in military formations
do not understand the strategic balance of temple and battlefield.

The Sage perceives blessings within the fortified pass,
and dangers beyond the unseen depths.

The foolish are bewildered by petty gains,
yet forget great harms.
Thus, affairs that bring profit in small matters
but harm in great ones,
are obtained here
while forgotten there.

Hence, there is no greater benevolence than loving others,
no greater wisdom than knowing others.
Loving others means no resentment or punishment,
knowing others means no chaotic governance.

Governance cannot be achieved through excessive affairs,
nor can law be effective with frequent changes.
Excessive affairs and frequent changes
will cause the common people to grumble,
meritorious ministers to rebel,
and the ruler will have means to summon them.

The roots of order and chaos,
the strategic balance of temple and battlefield—
the Sage discerns these in the unseen beyond form,
thus possessing foresight’s clarity.

Laozi said:
Though the rivers are vast,
their overflow is never beyond three days;
nor does a violent wind and rain
last longer than a moment in the sun.
Yet those who lack accumulated virtue
need not fear ruin,
for it will not reach them.

Worry is the source of prosperity,
joy is the source of ruin.
Thus, the virtuous turn weakness into strength,
transforming misfortune into blessing,
employing the Dao though it seems void,
yet never full of themselves.

When a state’s harsh governance erupts,
it is like the rivers overflowing,
or winds and rains raging violently—
they do not last long,
and ruin will soon follow.
Only those who lack virtue in their worry
yet know how to adapt changes
can still turn misfortune into blessing,
strength from weakness,
and understand the Dao’s unfathomable use.

Laozi said:
Serenity and tranquility
are the nature of humankind.
Ceremonial propriety and measured conduct
are the rules of affairs.
Knowing the nature of others
means one’s cultivation remains unerring,
knowing the rules of affairs
means one’s actions and movements are orderly.

A single decree issues,
yet no one contends with it—
this is called *the heart*.
Perceiving the root to know its branches,
grasping one principle to respond to all—
this is called *skill*.
To dwell in knowledge’s source,
act in accordance with its path,
understand how to ride upon affairs,
and know when to halt—
this is called *the Dao*.

If people praise and exalt me,
it is the power of my heart;
if they belittle and slander me,
it is the fault of my heart.

Words emerge from the mouth,
yet cannot be restrained by others;
actions originate from proximity,
yet cannot be restrained by distance.

Affairs are hard to complete yet easy to ruin,
reputation is hard to establish yet easy to discard.
All people tend to slight small harms,
neglect minor matters,
until great calamities arrive.

For calamity comes from within,
blessing is self-made.
Misfortune and fortune share the same threshold,
profit and harm are neighboring forces.
Without utmost precision,
none can distinguish them.
Thus, wisdom and foresight
are the gatekeepers of fortune and misfortune,
the pivotal mechanisms of action and stillness—
they must not be neglected lightly.

Heaven’s principle and human desires
align in one heart,
while noble and petty folk
diverge in one self—
are they not the same origin yet different names?

To grasp one principle and respond to all is called *skill*,
to see movement and know stillness is called *the Dao*.
Words issue from the mouth,
actions spring from the heart—
fortune and misfortune, profit and harm,
come like reflections in water.
Without utmost precision,
who can separate them?
Can one not examine oneself
and reflect within the heart?

Laozi said:
All know the triggers of order and chaos,
yet none grasp the means of preserving life.
Thus, the Sage assesses the world to act accordingly,
and contemplates affairs to devise strategy.

The Sage can be yielding or firm,
soft or hard,
weak or strong—
adapting to the times in movement and stillness,
establishing merit through resources,
foreseeing the reverse of things,
observing one matter to discern its changes—
forming patterns as they transform,
responding as they unfold—
thus their entire lives are unconstrained.

Affairs may be those that can be spoken of yet not done,
or those that can be done yet not spoken of,
or those that are easy to initiate yet hard to complete,
or those that are hard to complete yet easy to ruin.

Those that can be done yet not spoken of—
are selection and rejection;
those that can be spoken of yet not done—
are deceit and trickery.
Those easy to initiate yet hard to complete—
are affairs themselves,
those hard to complete yet easy to ruin—
are reputations.

These four matters
are the Sage’s careful considerations,
the insights of the enlightened.

There are times of order and chaos,
while governance rests with humankind.
Knowing the triggers of order and chaos,
yet failing to grasp the means of preserving life—
the fault lies with humankind, not the times.

The Sage adapts to the times in movement and stillness,
observing their changes,
thus their entire lives are unconstrained.

When the times are right yet governance is rigid,
how can one avoid blame
while failing to grasp the means of preserving life?

Laozi said:
The Dao respects the subtle and small,
acts without losing the moment—
a hundred precautions against calamity,
yet misfortune does not grow.

Calculating blessings yet not foreseeing them,
worrying about misfortune yet overestimating it—
like plants struck by frost in the same day,
the sheltered ones are unharmed.
The foolish may prepare,
yet their efforts match those of the wise.

Accumulated love brings blessing,
accumulated resentment brings misfortune.
All know how to avert calamity,
yet none know how to prevent it from arising.

Preventing calamity’s birth is easy,
yet saving from calamity is difficult.
Now people do not strive to prevent calamity’s birth,
but instead focus on saving from its aftermath—
even the divine cannot devise such strategies.

The origins of calamity and misfortune
are countless and boundless.
The Sage retreats deeply to avoid harm,
remains silent to await the right moment;
the petty do not know the gates of fortune and misfortune,
yet act and fall into punishment—
though they twist their preparations,
they cannot fully preserve themselves.

Thus, the superior cultivator
avoids misfortune first, then seeks profit,
shuns disgrace first, then pursues reputation.

Hence, the Sage always attends to the unseen beyond form,
while neglecting the already completed within sight—
thus calamity has no path to arrive,
nor can praise soil them with dust.

The Dao respects the subtle and small,
acts without losing the moment—
this is the essence of caution at the outset.
The foolish may prepare,
yet their efforts match those of the wise—
for people’s calamities
cannot be repelled before they occur,
nor can salvation be sought after they have arrived.

Thus, the superior cultivator
prioritizes avoiding misfortune and disgrace,
while placing reputation and profit aside,
never demanding them.

The Master Laozi says:

The common person’s Dao:
desires a small **heart**,
yet a great **will**,
wishes for all-encompassing **wisdom**,
yet upright **conduct**,
seeks many **abilities**,
yet few **undertakings**.

The so-called small **heart**—
before misfortune arises,
they guard against calamity and tread with caution,
not daring to indulge their desires.

The great **will**—
embracing all under heaven,
unifying diverse customs,
where right and wrong converge,
and they stand at the center.

The all-encompassing **wisdom**—
endless yet boundless,
flowing in four directions,
deep yet unfathomable.

The upright **conduct**—
standing straight yet unyielding,
pure white yet unstained,
in adversity never altering their principles,
in prosperity never boasting.

The many **abilities**—
possessing both literary and martial arts,
balanced in action and stillness,
their movements and gestures fittingly adapted,
bending yet never breaking.

The few **undertakings**—
grasping the essential to govern the multitude,
holding the strict to manage the broad,
remaining tranquil to steady the restless.

Thus, the small-**hearted** guard against the slightest danger,
the great-**willed** embrace all things,
the all-**wise** know all things,
the upright-**conducted** have nothing they refuse,
the many-**able** can govern all things,
the few-**tasked** hold fast to what they possess.

Hence, the Sage’s approach to **virtue**—
they do not slight the small and fail to act,
nor overlook the slightest fault without correction.
Their actions require no **diviners** or **shamans**,
yet ghosts and spirits dare not act first—
this may truly be called the most precious **virtue**.

Yet they tremble and quake,
ever vigilant day by day,
thus attaining the sincerity of **non-action** and unity.

The foolish person’s **wisdom** is already limited,
and what they undertake is excessive—
thus their actions always fail.
If they govern with **rightness**, their efforts are easy yet certain to succeed;
if they govern with **deviance**, their efforts are difficult yet certain to fail.
Abandoning what is easy yet certain to succeed,
and persisting in what is difficult yet certain to fail—
this is the folly of the confused.

The **will** must be great while the **heart** must be small,
**wisdom** all-encompassing yet **conduct** upright,
**abilities** many yet **undertakings** few.
These six principles—
the common person must strive to embody them.

A great **will** can contain all things,
a small **heart** guards against the slightest danger,
all-encompassing **wisdom** makes all undertakings possible,
upright **conduct** stands firm yet unyielding,
many **abilities** ensure nothing remains unaccomplished,
few **undertakings** bring strictness and steadfastness.

The Sage’s actions do not require **diviners** or **shamans**,
yet ghosts and spirits dare not act first—
it is merely through sincerity that they attain unity.

The Master Laozi says:
**Ren** is what people admire,
**Yi** is what people revere.
To be admired and revered,
yet meet with personal death and national ruin—
this is because they did not adapt to the times.

Thus, those who know **ren** and **yi** yet fail to grasp worldly **power**,
have not attained the Dao.

The Five Emperors valued **virtue/power**,
the Three Kings relied on **Yi**,
the Five Hegemons depended on **force**.
Now, applying the Dao of the Emperors and Kings to the age of the Five Hegemons—
this is not their proper Dao.

Thus, **goodness** and **evil** are alike,
praise and blame depend on custom,
actions are equal,
yet **harmony** and **disorder** lie in the times.
Knowing the **Heavenly** Way’s workings,
and understanding human actions—
then one can govern the world.

To know **Heaven** yet not know people,
is to lack the means to interact with customs.
To know people yet not know **Heaven**,
is to lack the means to align with the Dao.

If one’s **will** is straight yet their emotions are suited,
they will be assailed by **firmness**,
and forced to serve others.
If one’s **will** is suited yet their emotions are straight,
they will be consumed by **yin-yang** forces.
The Dao is not practiced—
I know why.

The Five Emperors valued **virtue/power**,
the Three Kings relied on **Yi**,
the Five Hegemons depended on **force**.

In the age of the Five Hegemons,
yet applying the Dao of the Emperors and Kings—
this is because they did not adapt to the times.

To fail in adapting to the times,
is to fail in knowing **Heaven** and people.
How then can they govern the world?

Those who attain the Dao—
externally transform yet internally remain unchanged,
externally transform to know people,
internally remain unchanged to preserve themselves.
Thus, within they maintain a steadfast unity,
while externally they bend and adapt,
moving with the times,
yet never falling into error.
What is precious in the Dao,
is its **dragon-like** transformation.

To uphold one principle,
and act in one way—
even if they achieve fullness,
they never alter.
Clinging to minor virtues,
yet obstructing the great Dao.

The Dao is **stillness** and **emptiness**,
not forcing things externally,
nor imposing on oneself internally.
Thus, undertaking actions in accordance with the Dao—
is not the work of those who do not know the Dao,
but the application of the Dao itself.

The **dragon** and **tiger’s** transformations—
this is the Dao of the great person.

Those who attain the Dao
adapt to all things yet never fall into error—
thus Laozi was called the **"Dragon"** of the Dao.

To embody the Dao’s **emptiness**,
externally not imposing on things,
internally not imposing on oneself—
the Dao is applied to all,
and the world is transformed.

The heavens and earth cover and bear all things,
the sun and moon illuminate and shine upon them,
the yin and yang nurture them,
the rain and dew moisturize them,
the **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** sustain them—
all share in the same **harmony/and**.

Thus, those who wear the Great Round
walk the Great Square,
those who gaze upon the Great Clarity
see the Great Brightness,
those who stand upon the Great Balance
dwell in the Great Hall,
and those who wander in the **mysterious/void** (*míngmíng*)
share the same light as the sun and moon—
shapeless yet giving rise to the shaped,
so the **true person** (*zhēnrén*) entrusts his time to the **spiritual platform** (*língtái*)
and returns to the **origin of things** (*wù zhī chū*).

To see in the **mysterious/void** (*míngmíng*),
to hear in the **silent** (*wúshēng*)—
within the **mysterious/void**,
only he has **awareness** (*xiǎo*);
within **stillness and emptiness** (*jìmò*),
only he has **illumination** (*zhào*).

His **application** (*yòng*) is to **not apply** (*wúyòng*),
only then can he truly **apply** (*yòng*).
His **knowledge** (*zhī*) is to **not know** (*wúzhī*),
only then can he truly **know** (*zhī*).

**Harmony/And** is the **universal Dao/Way** of the world.
The heavens’ covering, the earth’s bearing—
all align with the same **harmony/and**.

The **sage-king** (*huángdì*) wears the Round and walks the Square,
dwells in the Great Hall and stands upon the Great Balance—
can his **harmony/and** be lost?

The **true person** (*zhēnrén*) returns to the **origin of things** (*wù zhī chū*),
surely he must have **unique insight** (*dújiàn*) within the **mysterious/void** (*míngmíng*).

Thus, **application** is to **not apply**,
only then can he **apply**.
**Knowledge** is to **not know**,
only then can he **know**.
This is called **Great Harmony**.

The **Dao/Way** is what things **follow** (*dào*),
**Virtue/power** is what life **sustains** (*fú*),
**Ren** is the **manifestation of accumulated kindness** (*jī'èn*),
and **Yi** is the **principle of alignment with the heart and fitting for the multitude** (*bǐyú xīn ér héyú zhòngshì*).

When the **Dao/Way** fades, **virtue/power** flourishes;
when **virtue/power** wanes, **Ren** and **Yi** arise.
Thus, in the **Upper Age** (*shàngshì*), the **Dao/Way** is upheld but **virtue/power** is not yet emphasized,
in the **Middle Age**, **virtue/power** is guarded but **Ren** and **Yi** are not yet embraced,
and in the **Lower Age**, there is **fear of losing Ren and Yi** (*jīngjīng ér kǒng shī rén yì*), so **Ren** and **Yi** are clung to.
Therefore, the **noble person** (*jūnzǐ*) cannot live without **Yi**—
to lose **Yi** is to lose the very means of his existence;
the **petty person** (*xiǎorén*) cannot survive without **profit** (*lì*)—
to lose **profit** is to lose the very means of his survival.
Thus, the **noble person** fears losing **Yi**,
the **petty person** fears losing **profit**—
observing their fears,
the paths to **disaster** and **blessing** diverge.

When **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**, **Ren** and **Yi** fracture,
the **sage-kings** and **kings** (*huángdì wángbó*) are divided—
this is the work of the **changing times** (*shìbiàn*).

The **Dao/Way** guides them,
**virtue/power** nourishes them,
**Ren** bestows kindness upon them,
and **Yi** makes them **proper/right** (*yí*).
Though the four ages differ in governance,
their **noble rulers** and **ministers** maintain their **proper distinctions** (*yǒu fēn zé yī*).

Those who uphold the **Dao/Way** but not **virtue/power** are **sage-kings** (*huáng*),
those who guard **virtue/power** but do not embrace **Ren** are **kings** (*dì*),
and those who fear losing **Ren** and **Yi** are **lords** (*wáng*).
When **Yi** loses its **proper alignment** (*qǐ yí shī qí yí*),
**crafty deceit** (*zhìzhà*) thrives.

Laozi said:
*"Some seek profit and thereby harm themselves,
some seek harm and thereby profit themselves.*
To **force** (*qiáng*) the **ill** (*bìng*) with **heat** (*wēn*) when they crave **warmth** (*rè*),
to **force** the **thirsty** (*kě*) with **cold** (*hán*) when they crave **coolness** (*lěng*)—
this is how the **common folk** (*zhòngrén*) **nurture** (*yǎng*) themselves,
yet the **skilled physician** (*liángyī*) knows this as **the cause of illness** (*wéi bìng*).

**Delight** (*kuài*) in the **eyes**,
**pleasure** (*yuè*) in the **heart**—
these are the **fool’s** (*yú*) **advantages** (*lì*),
yet the **person of the Dao/Way** (*yǒudào zhě*) **avoids** (*bì*) them.

The **sage** (*shèngrén*) first **encounters** (*féng*) and then **unites** (*hé*) with the multitude,
while the **common folk** first **unite** and then **encounter**—
thus, the **gates of disaster and blessing** (*huòfú zhī mén*)
and the **contraries of profit and harm** (*lìhài zhī fǎn*)
cannot be overlooked.

There are matters where seeking **profit** brings **harm**,
and seeking **harm** brings **profit**—
not even **human effort** (*rénlì*) can **guarantee** (*bì*) them,
for **things** may **cause** (*shǐ*) them.

Thus, those who **first oppose** (*xiān yǔ*) and then **unite** (*hé*)
follow the **sage’s Dao/Way** (*shèngrén zhī dào*),
while those who **first unite** and then **oppose** (*yǔ*)
follow the **common folk’s Dao/Way** (*zhòngrén zhī dào*).
**Disaster** and **blessing**, **profit** and **harm**,
lie in wait—
their **unpredictability** (*bùkě bù chá*) is thus.

Laozi said:
*"Those with **meritorious deeds** (*yǒng*) yet **divergent from Ren and Yi** will be **suspected** (*yí*),
those with **guilt** (*zuì*) yet **aligned with Ren and Yi** will be **trusted** (*xìn*).*
Thus, **Ren** and **Yi** are the **constant proper alignment** (*chángshùn*) of affairs,
the **most honored rank** (*zūnjué*) in the world.

Though **plans** (*móu*) and **calculations** (*jì*) may **seem correct** (*dāng*),
and **worries** (*yōu*) and **concerns** (*huàn*) may **be solved** (*jiě tú*),
if the **state** (*guó*) is preserved,
yet one’s **affairs** (*shì*) **diverge from Ren and Yi**,
his **merits** (*gōng*) will **not be fulfilled** (*bù suì*).

Though **words** (*yán*) may **not align** (*wúzhòng*) with **strategy** (*cè*),
and **calculations** may **not benefit** (*wúyì*) the **state**,
if one’s **heart** (*xīn*) is **loyal** (*zhōu*) to the **lord** (*jūn*),
and **affairs** are **aligned with Ren and Yi** (*héyú rén yì*),
one’s **life** (*shēn*) will **surely be preserved** (*bì cún*).

Therefore it is said:
*"A hundred words, a hundred calculations, often **not fitting** (*bùdāng*),
are **not as good as** (*bùruò*) **abandoning haste** (*shě qū*) and **carefully examining Ren and Yi** (*shěn zhū rén yì*).*

**Ren** and **Yi** are the **grandchildren** (*sūn*) of the **Dao/Way**,
the **children** (*zǐ*) of **virtue/power**—
yet the four **never fail to interrelate** (*fù ruò bù xiāngjí*),
and **never truly separate** (*xiānglí*).

Thus, **Ren** and **Yi** are the **most honored rank** in the world—
for those who **value their own bodies** as the **world** (*wéi tiānxià zhě*),
can they **not abandon haste** and **examine carefully** these **Ren** and **Yi**?

Laozi said:
*"The **noble person’s** (*jūnzǐ*) **teaching** (*jiào*) originates from **himself**,
the **petty person** receives its **benefits** (*zé*).
**Profit** (*lì*) originates from the **petty person**,
the **noble person** enjoys its **merits** (*gōng*).

To let the **noble person** and the **petty person** each find their **proper place** (*qí yí*),
is to **harmonize merits** and **transform nourishment** (*tōng gōng yì shí*)
and thus **achieve the Dao’s fulfillment** (*dào dá*).

Many **desire** (*yù*) and thereby **injure** (*shāng*) **Yi**,
many **worry** (*yōu*) and thereby **harm** (*hài*) **wisdom** (*zhì*),
so **governing** the **state** with **what brings joy** (*lè*) ensures its **preservation** (*cún*),
while **tyrannizing** the **state** with **what brings joy** ensures its **ruin** (*wáng*).

Water flows downward yet is **vast** (*guǎngdà*),
the **lord** is **benevolent** (*cí*) yet **wise** (*míng*).
If the **lord** does not **contend** (*zhēng*) with his **ministers** (*chén*),
the **governing Dao/Way** will **be fulfilled** (*tōng*).
Thus, the **lord** is the **root and foundation** (*gēnběn*),
the **ministers** are the **branches and leaves** (*zhīyè*).
If the **root and foundation** are **not beautiful** (*bù měi*),
yet the **branches and leaves** flourish—
this has never occurred.

The **noble person** and the **petty person**—
both are **people** (*rén*).
If the **noble person’s** **teaching** (*jiào*) is **not received** (*bèi*) by the **petty person**,
how can his **virtue/power** (*dé*) **provide sustenance** (*zī*) for the **petty person’s** **nourishment** (*yǎng*)?

**Governing** the **state** with **what brings joy** ensures its **preservation**,
**tyrannizing** the **state** with **what brings joy** ensures its **ruin**.
If the **lord** is **good at yielding** (*shàn xià*) yet **does not contend** (*bù zhēng*),
then his **ministers** will **offer their loyalty** (*xiàn qí zhōng*).

**Stability** (*zhì*) secures the **root** (*gēn*), **depth** (*shēn*) strengthens the **foundation** (*běn*),
and thus the **state** is **safe** (*ān*).

Laozi said:
*"The **loving father’s** (*cífù*) **care** (*ài*) for his **son** (*zǐ*)
is **not** to **seek** (*qiú*) his **reward** (*bào*),
for **this cannot truly be resolved** (*bùkě nèi jiě*) in the **heart** (*xīn*).
The **sage-ruler’s** (*shèngzhǔ*) **nourishment** (*yǎng*) of his **people** (*mín*)
is **not** for his **own use** (*wéi jǐ yòng*).
**Nature** (*xìng*) **cannot** be **restrained** (*kě jǐ*).
When he **relies** (*shì*) on their **strength** (*lì*)
and **depends** (*lài*) on their **merits** (*xūn*),
yet **must exhaust** (*qióng*) them to **achieve** (*wéi*) **anything** (*yǒu wéi*),
then his **kindness** (*ēn*) will **not reach** (*bù jiē*).

Thus, to **raise** (*yǔ*) what the **people** **love** (*zhòngrén zhī suǒ ài*),
is to **obtain** (*dé*) the **people’s** **strength** (*zhòngrén zhī lì*).
To **promote** (*tuī*) what the **people** **hold dear** (*zhòngrén zhī suǒ xǐ*),
is to **obtain** (*dé*) the **people’s** **hearts** (*zhòngrén zhī xīn*).

Therefore, **seeing** their **beginning** (*jiàn qí suǒ shǐ*),
one **knows** their **end** (*bì zhī qí suǒ zhōng*).

The **heart** of **father and son** (*fùzǐ zhī xīn*) is **natural** (*tiānxìng*).
The **father’s** **love** for his **son**,
the **ruler’s** **nourishment** of his **people**—
if there is a **heart of expectation** (*yǒu wàngbào zhī xīn*),
then his **kindness** will **be lost** (*qí shī*).*

Thus, to **follow** (*yīn*) their **profit** and **profit** them (*yǔ lì zhī*),
is to **obtain** the **people’s** **strength** (*dé zhòngrén zhī lì*).
To **extend** (*tuī*) their **goodness** and **benefit** them (*yǔ shàn zhī*),
is to **obtain** the **people’s** **hearts** (*dé zhòngrén zhī xīn*)."

The **son** may be **disobedient**, the **minister** may be **disloyal**—
thus **Laozi** says:

*"When **people** are bound by **righteousness** (*yì*) in **love** (*ài*),
and **clans** unite through **collective strength** (*qúnqiáng*),
then where **virtue** (*dé*) extends broadly,
**authority** (*wēi*) reaches far;
where **righteousness** is applied thinly,
**force** (*wǔ*) governs little.

When the **ruler** takes the **world** as his **heart** (*tianxià wéi xīn*),
and **people** are bound by **righteous love** (*yìài*),
then **loyalty** and **filial piety** (*zhōngxiào*) arise.
When **clans** unite through **collective strength**,
then **crafty tyrants** (*jiānxióng*) emerge.

Where **safety** and **danger** hinge—
how can one not **discern** (*chá*) and **debate** (*biàn*)?

**Laozi** says:
*'If gained through **unrighteousness** (*bùyì*) and not **disseminated** (*bù bùshī*),
then **calamity** will strike his **person** (*huàn jí qí shēn*),
he cannot **benefit others** (*bù néng wéi rén*),
nor **provide for himself** (*yòu wúyǐ zìwéi*).
This is the **fool**—
how does he differ from the **owl** that **loves its young**?'

Thus, **holding** and **filling** it to excess (*chí ér yíng zhī*),
is not as good as **stopping** (*bùrú qí yǐ*).
**Sharpening** and **grinding** it to a point (*chuǎi ér ruì zhī*),
cannot be **long preserved**.

Within **virtue** lies the **Way** (*dé zhōng yǒu dào*),
within the **Way** lies **virtue** (*dào zhōng yǒu dé*),
its **transformation** (*huà*) cannot be **exhausted**.

Within **yang** is **yin**, within **yin** is **yang**—
all **affairs** (*wànshì*) are thus,
inexhaustible in their **clarity**.

When **blessing** arrives, **auspicious signs** (*xiáng*) appear;
when **calamity** comes, **auspicious signs** precede.
If one **sees auspicious signs** but does not **do good** (*bù wéi shàn*),
then **blessing** will not come.
If one **sees inauspicious signs** but **does good**,
then **calamity** will not strike.

**Benefit** and **harm** share a **threshold** (*tóngmén*),
**calamity** and **blessing** are **neighbors** (*tónglín*).
None but the **sage** (*shèngshèng*) can **discriminate** (*fèn*).

Thus it is said:
*"Calamity* (*huò*) **leans** on **blessing** (*fú*),
**blessing** **hides** within **calamity** (*fú xià huò fú*).
Who can **fathom** its **limit** (*qí jí*)?

**Calamity** and **blessing** **lean and hide** (*yǐfú*),
like **shadows** following **form**.
**Profit** doubles in **gain** (*huò bèi ér rù*),
it must **double** in **loss** (*bì bèi ér chū*).

**Goodness** accumulated but **not properly used** (*shàn jī ér bù shàn yòng*),
is like **rearing an owl** as one’s **son**—
**few** escape **self-harm**.

The **mechanism** of **benefit** and **harm** (*lìhài zhī jī*)
**reverses** and **overturns** (*fǎn fù*),
none but the **sage** can **know** (*wú shèngshèng mó zhī*).

When **people** are about to **fall ill** (*jiāng jī*),
they must first **crave** the **flavor** of **fish and meat**.
When a **state** is about to **perish** (*jiāng wáng*),
it must first **spurn** the **words** of **loyal ministers**.

Thus, the **dying** cannot be **healed** by a **good physician**,
and the **perishing state** cannot be **saved** by **loyal counsel**.

**Cultivate** oneself (*xiū zhī shēn*),
then one may **govern the people**.
**Manage** the **household** (*jūjiā lǐ*),
then one may **extend** to **officials and superiors**.

Thus it is said:
*"Cultivate* oneself, and **virtue** becomes **true** (*dé nǎi zhēn*);
**Cultivate** the **household**, and **virtue** becomes **abundant** (*dé nǎi yú*);
**Cultivate** the **state**, and **virtue** becomes **flourishing** (*dé nǎi fēng*).

The **people’s** means of **livelihood** (*shēnghuó*)
are **clothing** and **food**.
If **matters** concerning **clothing and food** are **attended to**, there is **merit** (*yǒu gōng*);
if **neglected**, there is **none** (*wú gōng*).
If **matters** lack **merit**, **virtue** cannot **endure** (*dé bù cháng*).

Thus, **following the times** but failing to **succeed** (*suíshí wúchéng*),
do not **alter** the **laws** (*wú gēng qí xíng*).
**Conforming** to the **times** but failing to **succeed**,
do not **change** the **principles** (*wú gēng qí lǐ*).
When the **times** return, this is called the **pattern of the Way** (*dào jì*).

A **state** cannot **stand** without the **people** (*guó fēi mín bù lì*),
the **people** cannot **live** without **food** (*mín fēi shí bù shēng*)—
an **unchangeable principle** (*bù yì zhī lǐ*).

Thus, if the **people** are **sufficient** in **clothing and food**, they may **live** (*mín zú yú yīshí zé kě huó*);
if **deficient**, there is **no merit** (*bù zú zé wáng gōng*).
If **merit** is not **established**, **virtue** cannot **endure**.

The **Sage-King** enriches his **people** (*fù qí mín*),
the **Hegemon** enriches his **lands** (*fù qí dì*),
the **dangerous state** enriches its **officials** (*fù qí lì*),
the **governed state** appears **insufficient** (*ruò bù zú*),
the **perishing state** is **empty of grain** (*kùn cāng xū*).

Thus it is said:
*"When the **ruler** does **nothing**, the **people** prosper of themselves;
when the **ruler** does **not act**, the **people** transform of themselves."*

Raising an **army** of **ten thousand men**,
spending **a thousand gold** daily—
after the **campaign**, there will **surely** be **harsh years**.

Thus, **arms** are the **unauspicious instrument** (*bù xiáng zhī qì*),
not the **treasure** of the **noble** (*fēi jūnzǐ zhī bǎo*).

**Conciliating** great **grievances** will **leave lingering resentment** (*yǒu yúyuàn*),
how can this be **not evil** (*nǎihé qí wéi bùshàn*)?

In **ancient times**, the **near** were not **summoned** by **words**,
the **distant** were not **commanded** by **speech**.
The **near** were **pleased**, the **distant** **came**.

**Sharing** the **people’s desires** brings **harmony** (*tóngyù jí hé*),
**sharing** the **people’s defenses** brings **solidarity** (*tóngshǒu jí gù*),
**sharing** the **people’s thoughts** brings **wisdom** (*tóngniàn jí zhī*),
**gaining** the **people’s strength** brings **wealth** (*dé mín lì zé fù*),
**gaining** the **people’s praise** brings **renown** (*dé mín yù zé xiǎn*).

**Actions** may **invite bandits** (*xíng yǒu zhào kè*),
**words** may **bring calamity** (*yán yǒu zhì huò*).
Do not **speak before others** (*wú xiān rén yán*),
only **speak after others** (*hòu rén ér yǐ*).
**Whispered words** may **travel a thousand *lǐ*** (*liú wén qiān lǐ*).

**Speech** is **calamity** (*yán zhě huò yě*),
the **tongue** is the **mechanism** (*shé zhě jī yě*).
**Words** spoken **inappropriately**,
even **four horses** cannot **retrace** (*sì mǎ bù zhuī*).

There is **no eternal order** of **government** (*wú gǔjīn zhìluàn*),
nor **unchangeable chaos** (*wú bùyì zhī tǔyǔ*).
**Ancient** and **modern**, some **govern well**, some **govern poorly**—
this depends on **ruler and people** (*ér bù yī yú jūn mín yě*).

The **Sage-King** enriches his **people**,
the **Hegemon** enriches his **lands**,
the **dangerous state** enriches its **officials**,
the **governed state** appears **insufficient**,
the **perishing state** is **empty of grain**.

Thus, in the **Tang and Yu** era, the **world** was **prosperous** (*dàitiānxià wǎng*),
while the **Warring States** saw **no wealthy people**.

Once, **Zhōnghuáng Zǐ** said:
*"Heaven has **five directions**,
Earth has **five phases**,
Sound has **five tones**,
**Things** have **five flavors**,
**Colors** have **five hues**,
**People** have **five ranks** (*wùwèi*).
Thus, between **Heaven and Earth**, there are **twenty-five kinds of people** (*èrshíwǔ rén*).

The **upper five** are:
**Divine Person** (*shénrén*), **True Person** (*zhēnrén*), **Dao Person** (*dàorén*), **Perfect Person** (*zhìrén*), **Sage** (*shèngrén*).
The **next five** are:
**Virtuous Person** (*dérén*), **Exemplary Person** (*xiánrén*), **Wise Person** (*zhìrén*), **Good Person** (*shànrén*), **Persuasive Person** (*biànrén*).
The **middle five** are:
**Public Person** (*gōngrén*), **Loyal Person** (*zhōngrén*), **Trustworthy Person** (*xìnrén*), **Righteous Person** (*yìrén*), **Ceremonious Person** (*lǐrén*).
The **next five** are:
**Scholar** (*shìrén*), **Artisan** (*gōngrén*), **Hunter** (*yúrén*), **Farmer** (*nóngrén*), **Merchant** (*shāngrén*).
The **lowest five** are:
**Common Person** (*zhòngrén*), **Slave** (*núrén*), **Fool** (*yúrén*), **Brute** (*ròurén*), **Petty Person** (*xiǎorén*).
The **upper five** and the **lower five**—
are as different as **man** and **ox or horse**.

The **Sage** **sees** with his **eyes**,
**hears** with his **ears**,
**speaks** with his **mouth**,
**acts** with his **feet**.

The **True Person** **sees without clarity** (*bù shì ér míng*),
**hears without sharpness** (*bù tīng ér cōng*),
**acts without following** (*bù xíng ér cóng*),
**speaks without publicizing** (*bù yán ér gōng*).

Thus, what the **Sage** uses to **move the world** (*dòng tiānxià*),
the **True Person** has **never surpassed**.
What the **Exemplary Person** uses to **rectify the world** (*jiǎo shìsú*),
the **Sage** has **never observed**.

The so-called **Way** (*suǒwèi dào zhě*)
has **no front or back** (*wú qián wú hòu*),
**no left or right** (*wú zuǒ wú yòu*).
All **things** are **mysteriously unified** (*wànwù xuán tóng*),
**neither this nor that** (*wú shì wú fēi*).

**Zhōnghuáng Zǐ**—
was he the **True Person** of **antiquity**?

His words say:
*"People have **five ranks** (*wèi*),
each **rank** has **five degrees** (*dèng*),
combined, they make **twenty-five** (*fán èrshíyǒu wǔ*).

The **highest** is the **Divine Person** (*shénrén*),
the **lowest** is the **Petty Person** (*xiǎorén*).
The **upper five** and the **lower five**—
are as different as **man** and **ox or horse**,
for the **Petty Person** **defies the Way** and **betrays virtue** (*wéidào bèidé*),
like **ox or horse** adorned with **garments** (*rú mǎniú ér yīn jīnyú*).

The **Sage** does not **reach** the **True Person**,
the **Exemplary Person** does not **reach** the **Sage**—
only their **cultivation of the Way** has **depths** (*zàodào yǒu qiǎnshēn*),
thus their **ranks** follow accordingly."

**卷之八: *Nángǔ Zǐ* Du Dàojiān’s *Zhuān* – *Zìrán Piān***

**Lǎozǐ yuē:**
*"Qīngxū zhě, tiān zhī míng yě; wúwéi zhě, zhì zhī cháng yě.*
To abandon favors and wisdom,
to discard the sage’s cleverness,
to reject the virtuous and capable,
to abolish rites and moral teachings,
to extinguish customs and debates,
to ban deceit and falsehood—
then the **Exemplary** and the **Petty** alike align with the **Dao**.

*Jìng, then all is unified;
Xū, then all is harmonized.*
**Supreme virtue** is **non-action**—
all things find their place within it.

The **Dao of emptiness and stillness**—
heaven’s duration, earth’s endurance,
**qi** subtly pervades, boundless.
Over all things, it holds no sway.

**Zìrán** is **heaven’s principle**;
**bù zìrán** is **human desire**.

When **clear and empty**, it shines—
this is **heaven’s natural state**.
When **non-action** governs, it is **ordered**—
this is **human nature’s way**.

**Zìrán**—then the **Exemplary** and the **Petty** align with the **Dao**.

Thus the **Sage**, divine and luminous,
illuminates the world—
yet no thing is ruled by him.

The **twelve months** cycle endlessly,
**wood, metal, water, fire, earth**—
their forces clash, yet their **Dao** depends on one another.
Thus **extreme cold** harms, yet **no cold** is without harm;
**extreme heat** harms, yet **no heat** is without harm—
so **what is permissible** and **what is not** both find their place.
Thus the **Great Dao** knows no **‘cannot’**—
what is permissible lies in its **principle**;
when one sees **what is permissible**, one does not rush toward it;
when one sees **what is not permissible**, one does not reject it.
**Permissible** and **impermissible** are like left and right,
like exterior and interior.

All things begin with **oneness**,
**time** marks their measure—
from antiquity to today, unchanging—
this is called **heaven’s principle**.

Above, it holds **Great Clarity**;
below, it manifests as **light**.
The **Dao** gives birth to all things,
its **principle** lies in **yin and yang**,
its transformation becomes the **four seasons**,
its division forms the **five phases**—
each attains its proper place.

In harmony with **time**, it flows with **law**,
its measures are constant.
Though the lowly lack ability,
the **Dao** above does not falter.
Ministers act in unity—
**heaven and earth’s Dao**:
**non-action** yet complete,
**no seeking** yet all is gained—
thus one knows that **non-action** brings benefit.

Between **heaven and earth**, what flows and transforms without ceasing?
It is **qi** alone.
There is **spirit** within it—
yet none can recognize it.

**Oneness** marks its beginning,
**time** its measure—
from ancient to present, it never errs—
this is called **heaven’s principle**.

The **Dao** gives birth to all things,
its measures are constant.
Something governs them—
yet none know who commands.
Thus the **Dao’s** grandeur and **virtue’s** nobility are unmatched.

The **Laozi** says: The **Sage** is like the heavens covering and the earth bearing, the sun and moon shining upon all, the **Yin** and **Yang** harmonized, the four seasons transforming—embracing all things yet not conforming, neither rigidly old nor newly fanciful, neither distant nor close in favor.

Thus, the **Sage** can follow the **Heavenly Dao**, for **Heaven** does not act at one time, the earth does not hoard one kind of wealth, and humans do not pursue one kind of affair. Therefore, undertakings are manifold, and actions proceed in diverse directions. Thus, those who wield arms may act with lightness or weight, greed or restraint—these four opposites cannot be uniformly applied.

The light of heart may wish to strike, the heavy of heart may wish to halt, the greedy may wish to seize, the restrained may see no profit—yet this is not their true nature. Therefore, the bold can be ordered to advance and fight, but not to hold fast to the unyielding; the heavy can be ordered to stand firm, but not to assail the enemy; the greedy can be ordered to attack and take, but not to divide spoils; the restrained can be ordered to keep their share, but not to advance and seize; the trustworthy can be ordered to uphold strictures, but not to adapt to circumstances.

The **Sage** employs these five qualities in combination, assigning them according to their talents. **Heaven** and **Earth** do not favor one thing, nor do **Yin** and **Yang** produce one kind of being. Therefore, the sea does not refuse the trickling waters to become vast, the mountains and forests do not reject the crooked and bent to become lofty, and the **Sage** does not spurn the humble words of the common folk to broaden their influence.

To cling to one corner while neglecting the rest, to take one thing while discarding others—this is to make one’s gains few and one’s governance shallow. **Heaven’s** command is singular, yet the **qi** of sensation varies, nature follows substance in difference, and transformation yields myriad distinctions—these cannot be arbitrarily forced into uniformity.

The **Sage** aligns with **Heaven** and follows the **Dao**, not regarding diverse regions and customs as obstacles, but covering and bearing them, nourishing and fostering them, all in one principle. **Laozi** says: What **Heaven** covers and the earth bears, what the sun and moon illuminate—though their forms differ and their natures vary, each finds its own place of rest.

What brings **joy** also brings **sorrow**, what brings **rest** also brings **peril**. Thus, the **Sage** tends the people by letting each follow their nature, rest in their dwelling, dwell where they suit, do what they are able, adapt to what they meet, and apply what they need. In this way, all things are in harmony, with no cause for mutual offense.

All things under **Heaven** have no intrinsic nobility or baseness; they are made noble by what is valued, and all things are noble. They are made base by what is despised, and all things are base. Therefore, the **Sage** who does not exalt the worthy does not cast fish into trees nor drown birds in deep pools.

A good shepherd of the people does not apply one law to all; though forms differ and natures vary, each finds their own place of rest. If one reverses this and forces uniformity, the **Dao** of life is lost.

Now then, what **Zhuangzi** called *Qíwùlùn* ("On Equalizing Things")—is it truly about equalizing things? It is about the **logic of equalizing things**. **Heaven’s** creation of beings assigns each according to their inherent talents and strengthens them accordingly.

In the time of **Yao**, his governance of the world saw **Shun** as Minister of Instruction, **Xie** as Minister of War, **Yu** as Minister of Works, **Houji** as Master of Fields, and **Xizhong** as Master of Crafts. In guiding the people, those dwelling near water were taught fishing, those in forests were taught hunting, those in valleys were taught herding, and those on land were taught farming.

The land suited their labors, their labors suited their tools, and their tools suited their talents. In the marshes, nets were woven; on the hillsides, fields were tilled. Thus, the people found ease in what they possessed, and what they lacked they exchanged for what they had skill in, while what they had skill in they exchanged for what they lacked. Therefore, few abandoned him, and many obeyed, like the wind passing through reeds, stirring them effortlessly.

Each responded according to their clarity or turbidity, and all sought what benefited them and avoided what harmed them. Thus, neighboring states looked upon one another, the sounds of chickens and dogs were heard across borders, yet footsteps did not cross into the domains of the lords, nor were tracks left beyond a thousand miles—all rested in their own dwellings.

Therefore, a chaotic state seems like a well-ordered one, a flourishing state seems like a decaying one, a state with abundance seems like one lacking, and a state with survival seems like one with excess.

The decaying is not without people, but each guards their own role; the flourishing is not from many people, but all are bent toward trivial pursuits; the abundant is not from excess wealth, but from moderation and few demands; the lacking is not from scarcity, but from sparse people and heavy expenditures.

Thus, the laws of the ancient kings were not their own creation, but what they followed; their punishments and executions were not their own doing, but what they upheld—the **highest virtue’s Dao**.

The ancient rulers of the world were at ease while their ministers labored, governing without action. In **Yao’s** time, **Shun** was Minister of Instruction, **Xie** was Minister of War, **Yu** was Minister of Works, and all officials held their posts, each according to their ability. When the right person was placed in office, the people rested in their dwellings, and the work was accomplished, the affairs settled—all the people said, *"This is as if by nature."*

**Laozi** says: To govern the world with the **Dao** is not to alter human nature, but to clarify and smooth what already exists. Therefore, to follow is great, to impose is small.

The ancient who dredged water followed its flow, those who grew crops followed the land’s suitability, and those who waged war followed the people’s desires. To follow is to have no rival in the world.

Things must first be in accordance with their nature before human affairs can be properly ordered. Therefore, the ancient kings’ institutions were based on human nature, establishing measures and regulations to guide it.

Without its nature, one cannot make it conform to instruction; with its nature but lacking the means, one cannot make it follow the **Dao**. Human nature has the potential for **virtue** and **righteousness**, yet without the **Sage’s** guidance, laws and regulations cannot make it turn toward the proper path.

To act against its nature, one must use what it dislikes to restrain deceit—thus, punishments are not applied, yet authority spreads like the divine. To act with its nature, the world listens and follows; to act against it, laws and regulations are proclaimed yet ignored.

The **Sage** establishes teaching in accordance with human nature and observes customs to govern. What the people love, the **Sage** loves; what the people hate, the **Sage** hates. Thus, the people’s hearts turn toward him, and he has no rival in the world.

**Dao** and **virtue** are the roots of merit and renown, what the people cherish. When the people cherish them, merit and renown are established.

The ancient who excelled in rule followed the **Dao** of the great rivers: the great rivers act without action to become vast, sink low to become broad, and thus endure as the world’s channels and valleys. Their **virtue** is sufficient, without action they receive all streams, without seeking they obtain, without striving they arrive. Therefore, they take the world.

#1 *"易所拙"* (easily exchange what they lack for what they are skilled in)

The **Dao** is such that the unadorned is most noble—thus wealth comes without striving,
the unseen is most clear—thus wisdom arises without display,
the unvaunted endures longest—thus greatness is achieved without self-aggrandizement,
dwelling where none reside.
Thus, one becomes the sovereign of the world:
without contention, none can contend with them;
when they cease to strive for greatness, true greatness is attained.
The rivers and seas are close to the **Dao**, thus they endure long and align with Heaven and Earth.
The sovereign who cultivates the **Dao** completes their work without claiming it—
not claiming it makes them strong and firm,
strong and firm without tyranny over others,
deep in the **Dao** means deep in virtue,
deep virtue brings lasting renown—this is called **mysterious virtue**, profound and distant,
contrary to the ways of things.

**Dao** and virtue are not tools for seeking fame,
yet fame follows naturally.
The ancient who excelled in rule
preserved the **virtue** of non-action,
dwelled in the position of non-contention,
completed their work without claiming it,
thus they could endure alongside Heaven and Earth.

The world has a beginning,
yet none know its principle—
only the **Sage** knows how.
Neither male nor female,
neither yin nor yang,
born yet not dying.

Heaven and Earth are completed,
yin and yang take form,
and all things are born.
Thus, yin and yang have round and square,
short and long,
existence and extinction—
the **Dao** names them.

Obscure and deep, yet without action,
in the heart it is subtle,
in the **Dao** it is correct,
life and death share the same principle,
all things transform and merge into the **Dao**—
simplifying life, forgetting death,
where can one not be long-lived?
Abandoning deeds and words,
following non-action,
guarding the **Dao** thoroughly,
not dominating things,
subtle and formless.

At the origin of Heaven and Earth,
all things revolve within the **Dao** yet differ in form—
utterly subtle, without substance,
thus they can embrace all;
utterly vast, without boundary,
thus they become all things;
utterly minute, without interior,
thus they are most precious to all things.
The **Dao** sustains life,
virtue stabilizes form.
The measure of the **Dao** is to abandon preferences and aversions,
without knowing yet without error,
easing the mind and harmonizing the heart,
without departing from the **Dao**.

Heaven and Earth unite as one,
yet divide into two,
then return and merge.
Above and below remain unlost,
united as one,
divided into five,
then returning to merge—
necessarily conforming to the square and compass.

The **Dao** is most intimate yet cannot be slighted,
most near yet cannot be distanced—
seeking it far away only leads back.
To know the ancient origins is to grasp the **Dao**’s principles.

Is the **Dao** the origin of the world?
Formless yet vast,
unspoken yet trusted,
transforming without measure,
its principle unknown—
only the **Sage** knows it.
Thus, daily responding to myriad affairs,
never opposing the **Dao**,
returning and merging—
this is the **Dao**’s principle.

Laozi said:
The **Emperor** has a name,
yet none know their essence.
The **Emperor** values **virtue**,
the **King** upholds righteousness,
the **Conqueror** grasps principle.

The **Sage**’s **Dao** in things is nonexistent—
only when paths narrow do they employ intelligence,
when virtue is shallow do they rely on punishment,
when insight is shallow do they scrutinize.
Those who rely on intelligence bring inner chaos,
those who rely on punishment invite grievance from above and below,
those who rely on scrutiny fail to seek goodness to serve their superiors and thus bring ruin.
Thus, the **Sage** follows Heaven and Earth in transforming their **virtue**—
Heaven covers, Earth bears,
guiding by season,
nourishment thus becomes abundant,
abundant nourishment brings order.
Even with divine sagacity,
what could replace this?

Abandon artificial knowledge,
reduce punishments,
return to clarity and stillness—
things will naturally correct themselves.

At the dawn of civilization, who was the **Emperor**?
In the **Primeval Age**, the Three Sovereigns:
the people were like infants,
breathing in harmony with the **Great Unity**,
without thought or action.
In the **High Antiquity**, the Three Sovereigns:
the people were like young children,
content with sucking and patting their bellies,
doing nothing deliberately.
In the **Later Antiquity**, the Three Sovereigns:
the people were like children,
simple and scattered, the **Dao** still in practice,
cooking meat and grains,
the world cherished them.
The Five **Emperors** valued **virtue**,
the world praised them.
The Three **Kings** upheld righteousness,
the world feared them.
The Five **Hegemons** lost principle,
the world scorned them.

When the **Mysterious Sage** does not act,
the **Plain King** follows,
establishing words and teachings,
becoming the teacher for ten thousand generations.
When a **Sage** arises again,
nothing can replace them.

The **Dao** as sovereign
is like a corpse standing solemn and silent,
yet the world receives its blessings—
one person covered by it is not excessive,
ten thousand covered by it is not confined.
Thus, excessive kindness is as harmful as excessive cruelty—
both encounter the **Dao**.

Kindness is giving without merit,
bestowing high rank without labor—
then those in office grow slack,
and idlers rush forward eagerly.
Cruelty is killing without guilt,
punishing those who follow the **Dao**—
then those who cultivate themselves cease to encourage virtue
while evildoers grow bold in defiance.

Thus, excessive kindness breeds deceit,
excessive cruelty breeds chaos—
deceit and chaos are the winds of a collapsing state.
Hence, when there are executions, the ruler is not angry,
when there are rewards, the ruler does not share in them—
those punished bear no grudge, for the ruler’s blame is just,
those rewarded feel no debt, for the ruler’s merit is complete.
The people know that punishments and rewards arise from themselves,
thus they strive for merit and cultivate their work without relying on others.
Therefore, the court is orderly without trace,
the fields are tilled without filth.

Thus, the **Supreme Sovereign** knows what is natural—
spring gives birth, autumn kills—
this is the **Dao** of Heaven.
The ruler follows Heaven’s **Dao**,
and subjects know what to fear and emulate.
Punishments and rewards arise from themselves—
no one harbors hopes of fortune.
The court is upright, the fields are clear—
the **Supreme Sovereign**’s ways can be restored.

The **Kingly Way** dwells in non-action,
practices speechless teaching,
remains still and unmoving,
fixed yet unshaken,
follows naturally without coercion,
achieves results without toil,
plans without error,
acts without fault,
speaks without rhetoric,
moves without ceremony,
advances and retreats in season,
active and still in accordance with principle.
Neither praising beauty nor hating ugliness,
neither favoring reward nor dreading punishment,
names are self-bestowed,
categories self-classified,
affairs arise naturally—
none originate from them.

If one seeks to constrain it, one only drives it apart;
if one seeks to adorn it, one only robs it of its essence.

Heaven’s **qi** is the **hun** (spirit-soul),
Earth’s **qi** is the **po** (corporeal soul).
Their interplay is profound and mysterious—
each abides in its proper domain.
Guard them and do not lose them,
and one ascends to **Taiyi** (the Supreme Unity).
The essence of **Taiyi** merges with Heaven.

The **Dao** of Heaven is silent and boundless,
without form or measure,
too vast to fathom, too deep to sound,
yet ever transforming with humanity—
wisdom cannot grasp it,
its motion turns without end,
its transformations unfold like divinity.
It follows naturally, ever yielding yet never leading.

In governance, one must hold a **empty heart** and **weakened resolve**,
clear and bright without obscurity—
thus ministers converge like spokes to a hub.
Whether wise or foolish, virtuous or base,
all contribute their fullest measure.
The sovereign gains the means to govern his ministers,
the ministers gain the means to serve their sovereign—
thus the clarity of ruling a state is achieved.

He who holds **all-under-Heaven** need not fear disorder,
but fear failing to secure the right people.
To secure the right people is to let the **Kingly Way** flourish above—
guard it and do not lose it,
and one ascends to **Taiyi**.

Its motion turns without end,
its transformations unfold like divinity.
Ministers converge, each contributing their fullest measure.
Thus it is known that the order or chaos of a state depends on its people.

**Laozi** says:
*"He who knows and loves to ask is sage,
he who is courageous and loves to ask is victorious.
He who rides the wisdom of the masses can accomplish anything,
he who harnesses the strength of the masses can overcome anything.
He who relies on the masses’ strength need not fear failure,
he who harnesses the masses’ momentum can achieve all-under-Heaven.
Without the **power** of proper **effort**, no **method** can succeed—
even the sage cannot force success.
Thus the sage, in undertaking any matter, never fails to utilize what is already present.
One who has a talent occupies a position,
one who has an ability undertakes a task.
If strength matches the task, the appointed will not labor in vain,
if ability matches the task, the executor will not find it difficult.
The sage combines and employs them all—
thus no person is discarded, no talent is wasted.
Wisdom, benevolence, and courage—
these are the universal virtues,
and love of inquiry enriches them.
To unite the wisdom of the masses,
to harness their strength—
then all-under-Heaven is unconquerable.
One who has a talent occupies a position,
one who has an ability undertakes a task—
the sage combines and employs them all,
thus no person is discarded, no talent is wasted."*

**Laozi** says:
*"What is called **non-action** is not that it does not draw near when summoned,
nor repel when pushed,
nor fail to respond when pressed,
nor remain unmoved when stirred,
nor become stagnant when still,
nor disperse when gathered.
It means private desires do not intrude upon public **Dao**,
passions do not cling to proper **method**,
actions follow **principle**,
achievements arise from what is already present,
pushing along the natural momentum—
artifice finds no place.
When the deed is done, the self takes no credit;
when the work is complete, the name is not claimed.
As water carries the boat,
as sand bears the **jue** (a type of cart),
as mud supports the **tuo** (a type of sled),
as mountains hold the **zhu** (a type of rope),
summer floods and winter pools—
all arise from high and low.
This is not what I do.
The sage does not shame his humble station,
but laments the **Dao**’s failure to prevail.
He does not grieve his short lifespan,
but grieves the people’s hardship.
Thus he remains ever **empty** and **non-acting**,
embracing simplicity and returning to naturalness,
not mingling with the myriad things.
**Non-action** is not having a heart like wood or stone—
unmoving.
The sage responds to things without preceding them,
following their natural momentum,
to shape all things—
what need is there for action?"*

**Laozi** says:
*"The ancient founders of imperial rule did not establish it to indulge their desires,
nor did the sage who ascended the throne do so for personal ease.
They saw how the strong oppressed the weak,
how the many tyrannized the few,
how the cunning deceived the simple,
how the brave overcame the timid—
and how the wise hoarded knowledge without teaching,
how the rich accumulated wealth without sharing.
Thus they established the **Son of Heaven** to unify all,
for one mind cannot illuminate all-under-Heaven,
so they appointed the **Three Ministers** and **Nine Officials** to assist,
for isolated states and distant customs could not receive his blessings,
so they installed the **feudal lords** to instruct them.
Thus Heaven and Earth, the four seasons—
none fail to respond.
No office hides its duties,
no state neglects its benefits—
thus the cold are clothed, the hungry fed,
the aged and weak cared for,
the weary rested—
none are left unprovided for.
Is the **Son of Heaven** then the heart of Heaven and Earth?
The vastness of the land, the multitude of the people—
without a ruler to govern them,
the strong oppress the weak,
the many tyrannize the few,
the cunning deceive the simple,
and the people cannot live in peace.
Thus the **Son of Heaven** is established,
the **Three Ministers** appointed,
to be parents to the people,
nurturing and guiding them.
The *Yijing* says:
*'The later sovereigns completed Heaven and Earth’s **Dao**,
supplemented what Heaven and Earth lacked,
governing the people left and right—
thus the heart of Heaven and Earth becomes visible.'*

**Shennong**’s body withered,
**Yao**’s limbs were emaciated,
**Shun**’s skin darkened from exposure,
**Yu**’s feet were calloused and cracked.
**Yi Yin** carried a caldron to serve **Tang**,
**Jiang Ziya** wielded a butcher’s cleaver before entering **Zhou**,
**Bai Li Xi** was sold into slavery,
**Guan Zhong** was bound in chains,
**Confucius** lacked even a single loyal follower,
**Mozi** had no warm bed—
not for greed of office or love of rank,
but to awaken the benefits of all-under-Heaven,
to eliminate the harms of the myriad people.
From the **Son of Heaven** to the commoner,
none escape laboring with their bodies,
none escape the strain of thought—
such is the way of seeking sufficiency in affairs.
The ancient sages’ ears, eyes, mouths, and noses were no different from others,
their hunger, thirst, cold, and warmth no different—
what differed was their **heart**.
They established the ultimate **principle** for all generations of living beings.
All who stand among the sages
rarely achieve their deeds without first exhausting their **heart-mind**,
yet when their deeds are done, they do not claim them—
this is what makes them sage.

**Laozi** says:
*"What is called the **Son of Heaven** is one who establishes all-under-Heaven with the **Dao** of Heaven.
The **Dao** of establishing all-under-Heaven
holds to **Oneness** as its safeguard,
returns to the root with **non-action**,
is **empty** and **still** without possession,
faint and boundless without end,
far-reaching without cessation—
seen, it has no form;
heard, it has no sound.
This is called the **classic course** of the **Great Dao**."*

The heavens and earth are the great parents of humankind.
All who bear blood and qi are the children of Heaven, with the sovereign as their leader, acting as Heaven’s deputy son.
Hence the title *Son of Heaven*.

The *Son of Heaven* regards the people as his own children—
if he does not neglect what nourishes them,
then Heaven’s gaze and Heaven’s hearing respond,
and this mutual resonance is called the *classic course* of the *Great Dao*.

**Laozi** says:
The *Dao* embodies roundness yet follows square law,
backs the yin while embracing the yang,
holds softness to the left and firmness to the right,
walks in darkness while wearing brightness,
transforms without constancy—
when grasped in its original essence, it adapts to all directions.
This is called *divine illumination*.

The heavens are round yet have no end—
thus their form cannot be observed.
The earth is square yet has no boundary—
thus no one can peer into its gate.
Heaven’s transformations flow without shape,
the earth’s growth extends without measure.

Things may have their masters,
but the *Dao* has none—
for it has no fixed form or power.
Its revolutions are endless,
like the sun and moon’s ceaseless motion,
or the seasons’ unending succession—
day and night, light and dark,
end and begin, manifest yet formless,
thus its work is accomplished.
It nurtures all things yet is not bound by them—
thus it conquers without being overcome.

The *Dao* gives birth to heaven and earth,
heaven and earth give birth to humankind,
just as an ancestor begets a father,
and the father begets a child.
Qi and spirit interact to shape myriad forms,
yet the *Dao* remains singular.

The *Dao* is formless, yet the body has form—
he who shapes form is formless,
he who commands things is not bound by them.
How divine!

The *regal warrior* is an emperor,
the *spirit-transformer* is a king.
The *regal warrior* follows the *Dao* of Heaven,
the *spirit-transformer* harmonizes the four seasons,
rectifies order within his lands,
and distant realms embrace his virtue.
He secures victory before battle,
and the feudal lords submit in homage.

The ancient *Dao*-adepts, when still, conformed to heaven and earth,
when active, followed the sun and moon,
their joys and angers aligned with the seasons,
their commands resounded like thunder,
their voice and qi did not clash with the eight winds,
their yielding and firmness did not alter the five tones.

They guided the people’s desires,
harnessed their strength,
and removed their tyrants and calamities.
Those who share benefits die for one another,
those who share grief aid one another,
those who walk the same path assist one another.
Move according to your own nature,
and the world will fight for you.
Thus, the skilled warrior uses what the enemy uses against itself—
the unskilled warrior forces the enemy to serve his own ends.
Using what the enemy uses against itself,
the world cannot resist—
but forcing the enemy to serve your own ends,
no one can be compelled.

When the sun and moon lose their brilliance, there is an eclipse;
when yin and yang lose harmony, there is war.
War brings injury to things.

The *regal warrior* rules with the emperor’s robes—
the world is governed.
The *spirit-transformer* returns his troops in triumph—
the people’s suffering ceases.

If Jie had received proper governance,
the battlefield at Muye would have been silent—
how could he have exploited the people’s desires
and used their strength
while abandoning his own lord?
It is only because the people had all abandoned their hearts
that one does not say *"regicide"* but *"removing tyrants and calamities."*

Alas.

*The Chapter on Lower Virtue***

Laozi says:
To govern oneself, the highest is to nurture the spirit, the next is to nurture the form. When the spirit is clear and the mind is tranquil, all limbs are at ease—this is the foundation of life-nurturing.
To plump the flesh and fill the belly, to indulge desires—this is the superficiality of life-nurturing.

To govern the realm, the highest is to nurture the transformation of the people, the next is to rectify the laws. When the people naturally yield to one another, vie for humility, compete to receive less profit, and vie to undertake labor, day by day they transform toward the superior and abandon their old ways without knowing why—this is the foundation of governance.
When rewards are generous and thus virtue is encouraged, when punishments are feared and thus wrongdoing is avoided, when laws are properly established above and the people submit below—this is the superficiality of governance.

In ancient times, the focus was on the foundation; in later times, on the superficial. Lower virtue is the rigid adherence to virtue.

The highest in governing oneself is to nurture the spirit—this is the foundation of self-cultivation. The next is to nurture the form—this is the superficiality of self-cultivation.
The highest in governing the realm is to nurture the transformation of the people—this is the foundation of governance. The next is to rectify the laws—this is the superficiality of governance.
Descending further, there are still those beneath lower virtue.

Laozi says: The ruler who seeks to govern does not appear in every age; the capable minister who can assist him is not found in every ten thousand. To seek such a minister with a ruler who appears so rarely is why perfect governance is not achieved even once in a thousand years.

The achievements of hegemons and kings are not established in every age. If one follows the people’s good intentions and guards against their corrupt hearts, sharing with them the same Dao, then the people can be made virtuous, and customs refined.
What makes the sage noble is not his imposition of punishments for crimes, but his understanding of where disorder arises.
If one opens the sharp inclinations of the people and follows them into licentiousness and excess, then abandons them to the law and punishes them with penalties—even if they ravage the world, their deceit cannot be restrained.

The gathering of wise and virtuous leaders is a chance encounter once in a thousand years.
The sage ruler does not appear in every age; the capable minister is not found in every ten thousand. When a ruler who appears so rarely obtains even one such minister—from the Tang and Yu onward, like Tang’s encounter with Yi Yin or Wen Wang’s with Lü Wang—such instances are rare in history.
Even figures like Guan Zhong under Qi Huan are not common.
Thus, governance flourishes rarely, while disorder prevails often—perhaps because virtuous men are few while the petty are many?

Laozi says: To dwell above the lakes and rivers while one’s heart is beneath the imperial gate—this is to cherish life.
To cherish life is to disregard profit lightly.
Yet if one cannot overcome oneself and instead indulges, the spirit suffers no harm.
If one cannot overcome oneself and yet forcibly resists, this is called severe injury.
Those who suffer severe injury will not live long.
Thus it is said:
To know harmony is to know constancy;
To know constancy is to know clarity;
To benefit life is auspicious;
To let the heart command the qi is strength—
This is called *Xuan Tong* (Mysterious Harmony).
To use its radiance and return to its clarity.
Humans have careers and retirement;
The Dao knows no bending or stretching.
Though one’s body may be in the lakes and rivers while the heart is at the imperial gate, one does not forget the fields.
Thus, those who embody the Dao retire with this Dao, act with this Dao—when the time is to stop, they stop; when the time is to act, they act.
This is called *Xuan Tong*.

Laozi says: Nothing is easier than doing good, nothing harder than doing evil.
What is called easy to do as good is to remain still and do nothing, to follow nature’s excess without enticement, to preserve one’s true self without alteration—thus it is said that doing good is easy.
What is called hard to do as evil is usurpation, regicide, arrogance, and licentiousness—restless and desiring much, contrary to human nature—thus it is said that doing evil is hard.
What is now considered a great calamity arises from the absence of moderation and measure.
Thus, in places of gain and harm, at the juncture of fortune and misfortune, one must be discerning.
The sage has no desires, no avoidance.
If one desires something, it is enough to lose it;
If one avoids something, it is enough to invite it.
When the will desires, one forgets what one is doing.
Thus the sage examines the shifts between action and stillness, adapts to the measure of giving and receiving,
balances the emotions of love and hate,
harmonizes the rhythms of joy and anger.
When action and stillness are appropriate, calamity does not intrude;
When giving and receiving are measured, guilt does not accumulate;
When love and hate are balanced, worry does not approach;
When joy and anger are harmonized, resentment does not arise.
Good and evil differ in appearance but share the same origin in the heart.
Nothing is easier than doing good, nothing harder than doing evil.
The steps to fortune and misfortune are uncertain—what one seeks to gain is lost, what one seeks to avoid is encountered.
Thus the sage examines the shifts between action and stillness,
harmonizes the rhythms of joy and anger,
and in all things does no wrong—what cause is there for resentment?
Those who embody the Dao do not greedily take what they should not,
do not reject what they possess.
They are always full yet never overflowing,
constantly empty yet easily sustained.
Thus, if one aligns with Daoist principles and measures,
food suffices to fill the empty,
clothing suffices to ward off cold,
and the body of seven spans is kept warm and nourished.
Without Daoist principles and measures,
even the power of a great kingdom is insufficient for satisfaction,
and the wealth of the world is insufficient for joy.
Thus the sage maintains a tranquil heart and easy will,
guards the spirit within,
and external things cannot deceive.
There is a method to cultivating oneself and an art to navigating the world.
Those who embody the Dao uphold their natural endowment,
find ease in their fate,
and eat only to fill the empty,
clothe themselves only to ward off cold.
They do not greedily take what they should not,
do not abandon what they possess.
Misfortune cannot be avoided, but fortune is not sought recklessly.
In prosperity, they do not grow arrogant;
in adversity, they do not abandon their principles.
They take joy in the natural state,
and endure with the Dao.

Laozi said:

*"He who overcomes others has strength,
but he who overcomes himself is strong.
To be strong, one must use others’ strength;
to use others’ strength, one must win their hearts;
to win their hearts, one must first be self-mastered.
Never has one gained others while losing oneself,
nor has one lost oneself while gaining others.

Thus, the foundation of governance lies in calming the people;
the foundation of calming the people lies in ensuring their sufficiency;
the foundation of sufficiency lies in not disrupting the natural order;
the foundation of not disrupting the natural order lies in simplifying affairs;
the foundation of simplifying affairs lies in moderating expenditure;
the foundation of moderating expenditure lies in eliminating arrogance;
the foundation of eliminating arrogance lies in embracing emptiness and non-being.

Therefore, those who understand the nature of life do not strive for what cannot be attained;
those who understand the nature of fate do not strive for what cannot be controlled.
The eyes indulge in the five colors,
the mouth craves the five flavors,
the ears revel in the five tones—
the seven orifices vie in conflict,
harming the singular essence.
Daily indulging in perverse desires exhausts one’s natural harmony,
and even the body cannot be governed—
how then can one govern the world?

To conquer others, first conquer oneself.
None can conquer others without first conquering themselves.
He who conquers others relies on force,
but he who conquers himself is strong—
for reason conquers desire.
When reason prevails, one wins the hearts of others,
and people willingly lend their strength.
When desire prevails, one exploits others’ strength,
and people withdraw their loyalty.
The distinction between Heaven’s principle and human desire is profound.

So-called mastery of the world does not mean occupying high rank or bearing a noble title,
but rather aligning with the will of the world and harnessing its strength.
To hold the title of king yet lack the people’s trust is to have lost the world.
Thus, Jie and Zhou were not true kings,
while Tang and Wu were not rebels.

When the Son of Heaven embodies the Dao, his authority rests with the four quarters;
when he loses the Dao, his authority is held by the feudal lords.
When a feudal lord embodies the Dao, his authority extends to the borders;
when he loses the Dao, his authority is confined to his inner circle.
Thus it is said:
Do not rely on others not taking what is yours—
rely instead on making it impossible for them to take it.
To walk the path of what can be seized is not the way of a usurper or regicide,
yet it profits nothing in securing the world.
Petting me brings loyalty; oppressing me breeds enmity.
The sage aligns with the world’s will, harnesses its strength,
and thus the world is governed.
As for tyrants like Jie and Zhou—
though they bear the title of king, they lack even one loyal subject—
this is why Tang and Wu refused to serve them.
When the world loses the Dao, the feudal lords become its guardians—
whose fault is this?

Laozi said:
The wise ruler does not alter what is established,
nor does he abandon what is constant.
Anger defies virtue,
war is a cruel instrument,
and strife is the source of disorder.
To scheme in secrecy defies virtue,
to favor weapons of destruction exacerbates disorder—
this is the height of perverting human chaos.
None can bring ruin to others without first inviting ruin upon themselves.
Do not sharpen the blade to its edge,
do not stoke the flames to their height,
soften the light, blend with the dust.

Human nature longs to excel over others
and resents those who surpass them.
This longing breeds contention,
this resentment breeds strife.
Strife disturbs the mind and disrupts the qi.
Thus, ancient sage-kings eliminated contention and resentment,
and with their absence, the mind was at peace and the qi flowed harmoniously.
Hence it is said:
Do not exalt the virtuous—
so that the people do not contend.
When contention is insufficient, yielding is abundant—
this is the path of mutual benefit for self and others.

Anger defies virtue,
war is a cruel instrument,
and strife is the source of disorder.
To scheme in secrecy defies virtue,
to favor weapons of destruction exacerbates disorder—
this is the height of perverting human chaos.
Wenzhongzi transmitted these words to Fan Li.
When Yue sought to attack Wu, Li cited them in counsel,
but Goujian did not heed them and was defeated at Fuqiao.
Thus, those who seek to harm others only harm themselves.
Would the virtuous act thus?

Laozi said:
To govern things, one does not rely on things to achieve harmony;
to govern harmony, one does not rely on harmony to govern people;
to govern people, one does not rely on people to govern the ruler;
to govern the ruler, one does not rely on the ruler to govern desire;
to govern desire, one does not rely on desire to govern nature;
to govern nature, one does not rely on nature to govern virtue;
to govern virtue, one does not rely on virtue to govern the Dao.
Rooting the Dao in humanity’s nature,
free from corruption, enduring in all things,
one forgets its origin and merges with its true form.
Clothing, food, rites, and customs are not innate to human nature—
they are acquired from without.
Thus, human nature is inherently balanced,
while cravings disrupt it.
Only those who embody the Dao can abandon external influences and return to the self.
With self-awareness, one does not lose sight of things’ true nature;
without it, one acts in confusion and agitation.
To indulge desire is to lose one’s nature—
actions never align with the true path,
governing life leads to self-ruin,
and governing the state sows discord among the people.
Thus, those who do not hear the Dao cannot return to their nature.
Nature and desire are inherently distinct.
All people are thus, but rulers are especially so.

To govern things without relying on things to achieve harmony,
one must first clarify one’s own nature,
then clarify the nature of things.
To clarify the nature of things is to assist in nurturing and harmonizing with Heaven and Earth.
Ancient sage-kings attained this within themselves,
thus their commands were obeyed and prohibitions respected.
In all undertakings, one must first calm the mind and purify the spirit.
When the spirit is clear and the mind is tranquil,
only then can affairs be set aright.
If judgment is clouded by praise or blame,
if the eyes are dazzled by color,
how can affairs be rectified?
Thus, emptiness is prized.

Water, when stirred, creates waves;
qi, when disordered, clouds the mind.
A clouded mind cannot discern what is right,
and waves cannot settle into stillness.
Thus, the sage-kings held fast to the One
to govern the emotions and natures of things.
The One is the most precious—
unmatched in the world.
The sage-king entrusted himself to the formless,
thus commanding the world.

Ancient scholars cultivated for themselves,
establishing the path of self-cultivation
before enacting the path for others."*

The Sage attains all within himself,
thus clarity and luminosity reside in his person—
nothing distant escapes his discernment.
He comprehends the nature of all things,
and his commands flow throughout the world.

Laozi said:
*"Yin and yang mold all things,
all riding upon the One qi to arise.
When above and below lose harmony,
qi ascends in turmoil;
when ruler and subject are discordant,
the five grains fail to ripen.
Spring’s austerity and autumn’s flourishing,
winter’s thunder and summer’s frost—
all are born of perverse qi."*

Between heaven and earth lies a single body;
within the six directions, a single form.
Thus, those clear in their nature
cannot be coerced by heaven and earth;
those precise in their correspondences
cannot be deceived by strange things.

The Sage knows the near to grasp the far,
unifying all differences into oneness.
When qi steams through heaven and earth,
and rites, propriety, shame, and music are not established,
people do not harm or oppress one another—
this arises from their state of undifferentiated obscurity.

When shame and modesty decline in the age’s decay,
when expenditures exceed resources,
when labor is excessive yet sustenance is insufficient,
the people grow impoverished and resentful, spawning strife—
thus, *ren* (virtue) is prized.

When people are coarse and unaligned,
forming cliques and factions,
each advancing their own,
harboring cunning and deceit—
thus, *yi* (righteousness) is prized.

When men and women dwell together without distinction,
thus, *li* (rites) is prized.

When the nature of life and death is abandoned,
and desires press upon one another without restraint,
disharmony ensues—
thus, *yue* (music) is prized.

Therefore, *ren, yi, li, yue* are means to remedy defects,
not the path of comprehensive governance.

Heaven and earth are one body,
the world is one qi.
Yang transforms, yin nurtures,
molding all things,
all riding upon the One qi to arise.

The Sage cherishes and nourishes the people,
viewing them as one family—
thus, the world attains peace.

If expenditures exceed resources,
labor is excessive yet sustenance is insufficient,
the people grow impoverished and resentful, spawning strife—
this is not the path of comprehensive governance.

If one can establish clarity and luminosity throughout the world,
and return the heart to its origin,
then human nature is good.
When human nature is good,
then heaven and earth’s yin and yang enfold it naturally—
thus, resources suffice and the people are ample,
while greedy, vulgar, and contentious hearts cannot arise.
*Ren* and *yi* are not employed,
yet *dao* and *de* are established throughout the world,
and the people are not dazzled by color.

Thus, when *de* declines, only then are *ren* and *yi* adorned;
when harmony is lost, only then is music adjusted;
when rites are excessive, only then is decorum adorned.
Hence, knowing *dao* and *de*,
one then knows that *ren* and *yi* are insufficient to enact;
knowing *ren* and *yi*,
one then knows that *li* and *yue* are insufficient to cultivate.

The Sage, sincere and clear, returns to the origin of nature—
the people revert to goodness.
When human nature is good,
heaven and earth’s yin and yang enfold it naturally,
resources suffice, the people are ample,
greed and vulgarity do not arise,
and strife subsides.
*Ren* and *yi* are not employed,
yet *dao* and *de* are established throughout the world.

Laozi said:
*"Governance through clarity and stillness—
harmonious and tranquil, yet profound and vast,
authentic and unadorned, serene and unhurried.
Within, it aligns with the Dao;
without, it conforms to righteousness.
Its speech is concise yet follows principle,
its actions persuasive yet accord with human nature,
its heart harmonious yet unfeigned,
its deeds natural yet undecorated.
It does not plot beginnings nor deliberate ends.
At ease, it remains; provoked, it acts.
It permeates heaven and earth,
harmonizes with yin and yang’s essence,
unifies with the four seasons,
shines with the clarity of sun and moon,
and aligns with those who transform with the Dao.
Cunning, deceit, and artifice
are not harbored in the heart.
Thus, heaven covers with *de*,
earth bears with music,
the four seasons never fail their order,
winds and rains do not act tyrannically,
the sun and moon remain clear and radiant,
the five stars follow their courses—
this is the luminosity of clarity and stillness.
When heaven is clear and earth is still,
only then can endurance be sustained.
The Sage governs through clarity and stillness,
imitating heaven and earth.
A clear heart aligns within with the Dao,
a still body conforms without to humanity.
Thus, transformation spreads without leaving home."*

Laozi said:
*"The duties of governing in a well-ordered age are easy to uphold,
its affairs easy to enact,
its rites easy to practice,
its responsibilities easy to fulfill.
Thus, one person does not hold multiple offices,
and one office does not oversee multiple tasks.
Farmers, scholars, artisans, and merchants
are distinguished by their districts and states.
Thus, farmers speak to farmers of storage,
scholars to scholars of conduct,
artisans to artisans of skill,
merchants to merchants of calculation—
so scholars lack no virtue in conduct,
artisans no toil in craft,
farmers no neglect in labor,
merchants no loss in trade.
Each finds ease in their nature.
Though forms and kinds differ,
their tasks are simple yet not contradictory.
If one’s calling is lost, they are held in contempt;
if one’s aspirations are fulfilled, they are honored.
Anciently, people held a single office,
and each office managed a single task—
thus, the ministers of a well-ordered age
found their duties easy to uphold,
their tasks easy to enact.
In later ages, the practice of holding multiple offices and shared duties arose.
Officials multiplied, records proliferated,
policies issued from many doors—
contrary measures undermined governance.
Those with foresight and distant vision
possess great talent,
yet in a well-ordered age, such abilities are not demanded of the people.
Those well-versed in literature and resolute in purpose,
eloquent and articulate,
possess abundant knowledge,
yet an enlightened ruler does not seek them from below.
Those who disdain the age and devalue things,
not conforming to convention,
exemplify scholarly integrity—
yet in a well-ordered age, such conduct is not used to transform the people.
Thus, the unattainable is not set as a standard for people,
and the unapproachable is not made the custom of the state.
Hence, talent cannot be monopolized by measure,
but Dao and technique can be transmitted through the ages.
Thus, national laws can be entrusted to the unlearned,
and military campaigns can be conducted by uniform methods.
Without awaiting ancient sages, people suffice as they are—
utilizing what they possess and combining their strengths.

The laws of the decadent age
set lofty standards yet fail to reach them,
impose heavy burdens yet cannot bear them,
demand the impossible yet dare not punish.
The people, burdened by triple responsibilities,
adorn their cunning to deceive above,
commit crimes and court danger—
though laws are severe and punishments harsh,
they cannot suppress their deceit.
When beasts are cornered, they strike;
when birds are cornered, they peck;
when people are cornered, they deceive—
this is what is meant."*

「Thus, talent cannot surpass virtue, nor words outdo deeds. Those with abundant talent yet prescient insight are not held accountable in times of governance; those with vast learning yet eloquent deceit are not sought by enlightened rulers.

The proud and self-righteous, who burden others with impossible tasks and demand what they themselves cannot perform, how could they avoid the deceit of desperate people? Laozi says:

The thunderous voice of *léitíng* can be likened to bells and drums;
the shifts of wind and rain can be known through music and rhythm.

What is grand and visible can be measured;
what is bright and discernible can be obscured;
what is audible can be tuned;
what is colored can be distinguished.

Yet the utmost grandeur of heaven and earth cannot be contained,
and the subtlest essence of *shénmíng* cannot be fully grasped.

When establishing calendars and measures,
distinguishing the five colors,
discriminating clear and turbid,
tasting sweet and bitter—
then the *pǔ* scatters and becomes tools.

When establishing *rényì* and cultivating rites and music,
then virtue shifts and becomes artifice.

The people adorn their cleverness to deceive the simple,
employ deceit to attack their superiors—
yet though some may uphold it, none can govern through it.

For when wisdom grows ever more intricate while virtue decays,
the truly great remain pure and unadorned, yet do not scatter.

The Sage carves from the *Dàpǔ* (Great Purity),
aligning with heaven and earth,
observing the patterns to craft tools—
as thunder and lightning are to bells and drums,
as wind and rain are to music and rhythm,
all are shaped from their likeness.

Yet as vast as heaven and earth,
as subtle as *shénmíng*,
there are limits to what can be fully explored.

Only the truly great remain pure and unadorned,
yet can serve as teachers for all ages.
Laozi says:

The governance of the truly great is empty and tranquil,
without visible desire,
as *shén* (spirit) and *xìng* (nature) align,
and form harmonizes with *qì* (vitality).
In stillness, the body attains;
in motion, the *lǐ* (principles) flow—
following the Dao of natural spontaneity,
as circumstances demand.

Indifferent and without contrivance, yet the world is in accord;
detached and without desire, yet the people return to simplicity.
No quarreling, yet resources suffice.

The giver does not claim virtue,
the receiver does not refuse—
virtue returns naturally,
and none can hinder it.

Debate without words,
the Way without teaching—
if one attains this,
it is called *Tiānfǔ* (Heaven’s Treasury).
Taking from it without depletion,
drawing from it without exhaustion—
none know its source,
this is called *Yáoguāng* (Shaking Light).
*Yáoguāng* is the nourishment of all things.

The *Běichén* (North Star) is the exalted sovereign of heaven.
Firmly seated at the center of the celestial sphere,
all stars bow before it.

The truly great take the Way as their model,
as *shén* and *xìng* align,
indifferent and without contrivance,
yet the world is in accord.

*Yáoguāng* resides in the ladle of the Big Dipper,
nourishing all things,
revolving leftward with the heavens,
as the sun completes its daily cycle.

When the Dipper does not descend its blessings,
the people are sustained in their sustenance.
Shun observed the *Xuánjī* (the rotating stars) to regulate the seven celestial officials—
was not his understanding of heaven profound?

Laozi says:

Heaven cherishes its *jīng* (refined essences),
earth its *píng* (levelness),
humans their *qíng* (affections).

The *jīng* of heaven are the sun, moon, stars,
thunder, lightning, wind, and rain.
The *píng* of earth are water, fire, metal, wood, and soil.
The *qíng* of humans are thought, perception, cleverness, and the emotions of joy and anger.

Thus, closing the four gates,
rectifying the five pathways#12,
one aligns with the Dao.

*Shénmíng* is hidden in the formless,
*jīngqì* returns to its true essence.
The eyes are bright yet do not gaze,
the ears are keen yet do not listen,
the speech is apt yet does not speak,
the mind is lucid yet does not deliberate—
abandoning yet not acting,
knowing yet not boasting,
following the natural inclinations of life,
yet understanding that harm is inevitable.

When *jīng* resides in the eyes, their vision is clear;
when it lingers in the ears, their hearing is acute;
when it stays in the mouth, their speech is precise;
when it gathers in the heart, their thoughts are profound.

Thus, closing the four gates,
one remains free from harm all their life—
the four limbs and nine orifices neither die nor live,
this is called the *Zhēnrén* (True Person).

The earth’s production of wealth
has no greater foundation than the five phases.
The Sage regulates the five phases,
and governance remains unerring.

Humans possess five *xìng* (natures) corresponding to heaven,
and five stars corresponding to earth.
When the five phases and five natures move,
the seven emotions arise—
how could one not love their body?

The spirit dwells in the heart,
the refined essence in the kidneys,
the *hún* (ethereal soul) in the liver,
the *pò* (corporeal soul) in the lungs,
the intention in the spleen,
and *shénmíng* in the formless.

Neither giving life nor ceasing it,
this is called the *Zhēnrén* (True Person).

Laozi says:

The balance between left and right
has no partiality in lightness or weight,
thus it can serve as *píng* (level).

The plumb line within and without
has no partiality in crookedness or straightness,
thus it can serve as *zhèng* (rectitude).

The ruler’s laws
have no partiality in favor or dislike,
thus they can serve as *lìng* (command).

Virtue has no fixed foundation,
grudges have no place to hide—
this is to follow the Dao and unite human hearts.

Thus, those who govern
know not to interfere.

Water overwhelms and shatters the boat,
wood strikes and snaps the axle—
yet they do not blame water and stone,
but punish the clumsy and the unskilled—
this is not wisdom.

Hence, when the Dao has wisdom, it brings chaos;
when virtue has intent, it becomes perilous;
when the heart has eyes, it grows dizzy.

The *quánhéng guījǔ* (weights and measures, square and compass)
are fixed and unchanging,
ever consistent and never deviating,
ever straight and never lingering.

Once shaped, they endure for ten thousand ages—
this is the Way of non-action.

Humans have partial inclinations,
and none can avoid harming the Dao.

The ruler without partiality,
thus the law is singular and commands are obeyed.

Hence, when virtue has intent, it becomes perilous;
when the heart has eyes, it grows dizzy.

Knowing that *quánhéng guījǔ* are fixed and unchanging,
then one knows that the singular is the Way of non-action.

A hundred rulers employed it,
ten thousand ages transmitted it.

Laozi says:

People say:
"A kingdom has a doomed sovereign,
but the world lacks a doomed Dao."

Humans may be desperate,
yet the principles of the Dao remain unbroken.
Thus, those who follow non-action,
are the essence of the Dao.

Attaining the essence of the Dao,
one responds to all things without end.
Hence, they do not rely on the Dao’s myriad principles,
nor monopolize their own abilities—
their limits are not distant.

The sovereign does not step outside their door
yet knows the world—
by observing things to discern things,
and by observing people to know people.»

Thus, when one accumulates the strength of what can be raised,
there is nothing it cannot overcome.
When the wisdom of the multitude is employed,
there is nothing it cannot accomplish.
A thousand-strong force lacks no provisions,
a ten-thousand-strong host lacks no function.

Craftsmen have no divergent skills,
scholars hold no dual offices,
each guards their station,
and none may overstep—
people find their proper place,
things find their proper rest.
Thus, tools are not ill-used,
and duties are not neglected.
Debts are few and easily repaid,
duties are few and easily upheld.
Burdens are light and easily encouraged.
The sovereign governs with minimal measures,
while the people achieve great deeds,
so ruler and subjects do not weary of one another.

Heaven does not govern itself—there are those who govern as Heaven,
Earth does not govern itself—there are those who govern as Earth.
Who are these "those"?
There are doomed sovereigns, but no doomed Dao.

Yī Yǐn five times approached Jié but was not used,
for he relied on his own abilities
and did not know the Way of aligning with others.
Thus, Yī Yǐn did not serve Xià but served Tāng instead.
Could Xià not have perished?
Could Tāng not have risen?

Laozi says:
The *Emperor* embodies the *Tàiyī* [Ultimate One],
the *King* follows the *Yīnyáng* [yin-yang],
the *Conqueror* aligns with the *Four Seasons*,
the *Lord* applies the *Six Lü* [musical pitches].

To embody the *Tàiyī* is to illuminate the nature of Heaven and Earth,
to harmonize the relationships of virtue and the Dao.
To be as luminous as the sun and moon,
to resonate with all things,
to balance movement and stillness with yin and yang,
to temper joy and anger with the Four Seasons—
covering all things with the Dao,
bestowing rewards without favor;
even the smallest creatures,
from the flying moth to the crawling worm,
all look up to virtue and thrive.
Virtue flows beyond borders,
and fame endures through the ages.

To follow *Yīnyáng* is to inherit the harmony of Heaven and Earth,
to share brilliance with Heaven and Earth,
to shine as brightly as the sun and moon,
to possess spirits as divine as ghosts and gods.
To wear the round and tread the square,
to embrace the plumb line and rest on the level,
to govern oneself internally,
to win hearts externally,
to issue commands—
and the world follows the wind.

To align with the *Four Seasons* is to let
spring generate, summer grow,
autumn harvest, winter store—
to give and take with moderation,
to enter and exit with measure,
to temper joy and anger, firmness and gentleness,
without straying from principle.
Gentle yet not fragile,
firm yet not harsh,
broad yet not reckless,
solemn yet not perverse—
to nurture the people with yielding and compliance,
to embrace the foolish and contain the unworthy,
without partial affection.

To apply the *Six Lü* is to know
when to give life and when to take it,
when to reward and when to punish,
when to give and when to take—
for without these, there is no Dao.
To suppress chaos, restrain violence,
to promote the virtuous and discard the unworthy,
to rectify and contain for order,
to repel danger and level the uneven,
to correct the crooked and establish the straight,
to illuminate the principles of opening and closing—
to ride the times and harness the people’s desires,
thus subduing hearts.

The *Emperor* who does not embody *Yīnyáng* will be encroached upon;
the *King* who does not follow the *Four Seasons* will be diminished;
the *Conqueror* who does not apply the *Six Lü* will be humiliated;
the *Lord* who loses the plumb line will be deposed.

Thus, the small acting as the great
remains unobstructed even in narrowness;
the great acting as the small
becomes confined even in vastness.

Why not call them *Huáng* [August] but instead *Emperor*, *King*, *Conqueror*, *Lord*?
It is to honor the *Huáng* [August].

The *Emperor* loses the Dao and only then virtue,
the *King* loses virtue and only then benevolence,
the *Conqueror* loses benevolence and only then righteousness,
the *Lord* loses righteousness and only then ritual.
When the great stands, the small is present;
when the small stands, the great is lost.

Laozi says:
Great territory and many people are not enough for strength;
strong armor and sharp weapons cannot guarantee victory;
high walls and deep moats are not enough for defense;
harsh punishments and severe laws are not enough for awe.

For those who govern with virtue,
even smallness ensures survival;
for those who govern without virtue,
even greatness ensures ruin.

Thus, the best defenders need no resistance,
the best warriors need no battle—
they ride the times and follow the people’s desires,
and take the world.

Therefore, those skilled in governance accumulate *virtue*;
those skilled in war cultivate *anger*.
When *virtue* is accumulated, the people can be used;
when *anger* is cultivated, awe can be established.

Where *culture* reaches deeply, *authority* is widely obeyed;
where *virtue* is broadly applied, *awe* extends far.
The broader it is, the stronger we become while the enemy weakens.

Those skilled in war first weaken the enemy, then fight,
so their expenditures are halved while their gains are tenfold.

A thousand-chariot state that practices *cultural virtue* will reign;
a ten-thousand-chariot state that favors war will perish.

The victorious army wins before battle,
the defeated army fights before seeking victory—
this is ignorance of the Dao.

Those who practice *cultural virtue*, though small, endure;
those who favor war, though great, perish.

Indeed, those skilled in governance accumulate *virtue*,
those skilled in war cultivate *anger*.
Only those who know war’s origin use it to stop chaos,
not to create it—
thus the people are unharmed and the state endures long.

**From *Tōng Xuān Zhēn Jīng* (Continuation of the *True Scripture of the Mystic Dao*), Volume Ten**
**Southern Valley Master Du Dàojiān’s Compilation**
**The Chapter on Supreme Benevolence**

**Laozi says:**
The Dao of the noble one is to cultivate stillness to refine the self, and frugality to nourish life.
Stillness prevents the lower ranks from disturbance; frugality prevents the people from grievance.
When the lower ranks are disturbed, governance falters; when the people grieve, virtue wanes.
When governance falters, the worthy do not offer counsel;
when virtue wanes, the brave do not fight.

But a chaotic ruler does otherwise:
In a single day, he possesses the wealth of the realm,
dwelling in the lord’s authority, exhausting the people’s strength
to indulge the desires of his ears and eyes.
His ambitions fix on palaces and pavilions, moats and gardens, fierce beasts and rare curiosities.
The poor suffer hunger, while tigers and wolves gorge on fodder;
the people freeze, yet the lord’s halls are draped in embroidered silks.
Thus, when the ruler hoards these useless things,
the realm’s people lose their natural harmony.

The supreme benevolent one practices stillness to refine the self,
frugality to nourish the people—
this is what the noble one must do.
Disturbance below leads to chaotic governance;
the people’s grievance thins virtue—
the noble one does not act thus.

How could one willingly harm what is beneficial to cultivate what is useless,
hoard what is without use to corrupt what is useful?

Laozi says:
Without simplicity, virtue cannot be illuminated;
without tranquility, the distant cannot be attained;
without magnanimity, judgments cannot be decisive.

With the eyes of the realm to see, the ears of the realm to hear,
the wisdom of the realm to deliberate, the strength of the realm to contend—
thus commands descend to their full extent,
while the sincerity of ministers reaches the sovereign’s ear.
Officials act with precision, and ministers gather like spokes to a wheel.

He does not reward with gifts for joy,
nor punish with crimes for anger.
Laws are enforced without cruelty;
ears and eyes are open without deception.
Good and ill are laid bare daily without obstruction.
Thus the worthy exhaust their wisdom,
the unworthy exert their strength,
the near find security in their nature,
the distant are drawn by virtue—
this is the Dao of employing people.

Simplicity, tranquility, magnanimity, and fairness—
these are the affairs of benevolent governance.

The Dao of employing people:
If one sees and hears with the eyes and ears of the realm,
then clarity and insight are vast;
if one deliberates and contends with the wisdom and strength of the realm,
then achievements are great.
Thus the worthy exhaust their wisdom,
the foolish expend their strength,
the near are bound by favor,
the distant submit to virtue—
this is why the Three Dynasties endured,
while later ages could not match them.

He who rides in carriages and horses
travels a thousand *li* without labor;
he who sails in boats and junks
crosses rivers and seas without exertion.
If words are true, even a commoner with a load of firewood
should not be discarded;
if words are false, even a sovereign or minister
should not be employed.
Right and wrong cannot be judged by rank or status.

If a plan is useful, one does not shame its position;
if speech is practicable, one does not prize its eloquence.

But a dark ruler does otherwise:
Few ministers offer sincere loyalty,
for their persons are not employed.
Instead, he favors the corrupt and crooked;
the worthy cannot be seen,
while the distant and lowly, though they exhaust their strength and loyalty,
cannot be heard.

If one speaks, he is trapped by words;
if one remonstrates, he is punished by law.
Yet such a one seeks to pacify the realm and preserve the world—
how far he strays from wisdom!

The Creator lends me existence; if taken, I have none.
To borrow is to wield great power indeed.

Carriages and horses replace footsteps,
boats and junks cross rivers—
thousand-*li* journeys reached without labor,
for their strength is borrowed.
The sovereign borrows ministers to govern,
ministers borrow the sovereign to fulfill their ambitions.
To lose the use of borrowing is to be a solitary tyrant.
Only the enlightened sovereign can attain this.

Laozi says:
Those who honor life
do not, though rich and noble, let nourishment harm the body,
nor, though poor and lowly, let profit burden the form.

Now, having inherited the noble rank of our ancestors,
we must cherish it—
for life’s origin is long,
yet to lose it lightly is bewildering indeed.

Thus, if one governs the realm with the body’s virtue,
one can entrust the realm to it;
if one loves the realm with the body’s virtue,
one can then #2*deposit* the realm with it.

No one values life more than to honor it.
To honor life is to avoid desires that kill the self.

Men receive their ancestors’ blessings yet fail to guard themselves,
seeking from their sustenance what instead brings ruin to their bodies and families—
how much deeper their confusion grows!

**Wénzǐ asked:** What is the root of governing the state?
Laozi said: The root lies in governing the self.
Never has it been heard that a disordered self brings order to the state,
or that a disordered state brings order to the self.
Thus it is said:
Refine the self, and its virtue becomes genuine.
The Dao’s utmost subtlety:
A father cannot teach it to his son,
nor a son receive it from his father.
Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao;
the name that can be named is not the constant name.

The state’s root is the family;
the family’s root is the self.
**Wénzǐ asked** about the foundation of harmonizing the state,
and Laozi spoke of the root being in governing the self—
thus, when the self is governed, the family is governed;
when the family is governed, the state is governed.

The self is like the state;
the state is like the self.
The *Shījīng* says:
*"He who wields the axe to fell the axe—
his model is not distant."*

**Wénzǐ asked:** What deed makes the people love their ruler?
Laozi said:
Rule them in due season, and treat them with reverence and caution,
as if standing at the edge of a precipice,
as if walking on thin ice.
Between heaven and earth,
the good are what I nurture,
the wicked are what I oppose.

In ancient times, the ministers of Shang and Xia
turned against their tyrants, Jié and Zhòu,
and served Tāng and Wǔ instead;
the people of Hòushā
attacked their own lord
and submitted to Shénnóng’s rule.
Thus it is said:
What the people fear, one must also fear.

Shùn’s virtuous deeds made the realm emulate him.
**Wénzǐ asked** what deed makes the people love their ruler,
and Laozi spoke of ruling them in due season,
treating them with reverence and caution—
the good, I nurture; the wicked, I oppose.

Then it follows that if a ruler treats his ministers like dogs and horses,
his ministers will treat him as an enemy.

The people can both uphold their ruler and overthrow him—
this is what makes him worthy of fear.

Laozi said:
To govern the great, the Dao cannot be trifled with;
to rule vast lands, measures cannot be narrow;
to hold high office, duties cannot be burdensome;
to lead many people, instruction cannot be harsh.

When duties are burdensome, they become difficult to manage;
when laws are harsh, they become difficult to enforce;
when demands are excessive, they become difficult to fulfill.

Measure an inch, and by the time you reach a *zhàng*,
the error will be great;
weigh a *shú* of grain, and by the time you reach a *dàn*,
the excess will be heavy.

But if you weigh a *dàn* and measure a *zhàng*,
the errors will be few.

What is broadly measured is easier to govern wisely,
but what is minutely debated is difficult to make wise.

Thus, what brings no benefit to governance but fosters chaos,
the Sage does not do;
what serves no purpose but wastes resources,
the wise do not practice.

Therefore, deeds should not be excessive in their demands,
matters should not be overcomplicated,
demands should not be too many.

When deeds are concise, they are easily accomplished;
when matters are simplified, they are easily governed;
when demands are few, they are easily fulfilled.
When entrusted to the people, this is effortless.

Thus, petty debates harm principle,
petty principles undermine the Dao.
The Dao, when made small, cannot prevail;
to prevail, it must be simple.

Measurements have their breadth and narrowness,
wisdom has its depth and shallowness.
To rule vast lands and many people,
shallow wisdom and narrow measures are insufficient.

How much more so for one in high office governing great affairs—
could they be entangled in trivialities and laziness?

Petty debates harm principle,
petty principles harm the Dao—
this is the business of the petty man;
the noble does not engage in it.

The river flows far because it meanders,
the mountain stands high because it rises gradually,
the Dao transforms because it moves with ease.

To master one skill, to be precise in one matter,
to excel in one ability—
one may be eloquent in detail,
but cannot broadly respond.

The harmonizer of sounds tightens the small strings
and loosens the large ones;
the organizer of affairs burdens the lowly
and grants ease to the noble.

The words of the Dao say:
Vague and indistinct, aligning with Heaven’s might,
those who share its *qi* become Emperors,
those who share its virtue become Kings,
those who share its achievements become Conquerors,
those lacking in all three perish.

Thus, without speaking, they inspire trust;
without bestowing, they inspire benevolence;
without anger, they inspire awe—
this is how they move Heaven’s heart.

To bestow and yet lack benevolence,
to speak and yet lack trust,
to anger and yet lack awe—
this is to act through mere appearance.

Therefore, with the Dao to govern,
even few laws suffice to rule;
without the Dao to govern,
even many laws suffice only to bring chaos.

The small vessel fills quickly and cannot endure long;
the great vessel matures late but attains lasting life.

Those who share *qi* with Heaven become Emperors,
those who share virtue become Kings,
those who share achievements become Conquerors,
those lacking in all three perish.

Thus, when the Dao governs affairs,
laws are few yet rule is easy;
when the Dao does not govern,
laws are many yet chaos ensues.

Laozi says:
A whale out of water is dominated by ants;
a ruler who abandons his proper role and contests matters with his ministers is dominated by his officials.

If a ruler relies on his own ability and despises those who guard their posts—
listening only to flatterers while hiding the wise—
and seizes authority for himself,
his intelligence grows constrained while his burdens increase.

When schemes fail below, he cannot enforce justice;
when conduct falters in office, he cannot maintain control.
Lacking wisdom to govern, lacking authority to punish,
he cannot properly engage with the realm.

Joy and anger show on his face,
desires reveal themselves outwardly—
then those who guard their posts abandon principle to curry favor,
and officials pervert the law to follow the wind.
Rewards do not match deeds, punishments do not fit crimes—
thus superiors and inferiors grow estranged, and ruler and minister harbor resentment.

Officials grow chaotic, yet wisdom cannot resolve it;
praise and blame arise, yet clarity cannot illuminate.
When faults are not his own yet he blames himself,
the ruler grows ever more exhausted while ministers grow ever more idle.

This is like a substitute carpenter—
few who replace the master carpenter do not injure their hands.

When a ruler loses the Dao, he is controlled by his ministers,
just as a whale out of water is dominated by ants.

The Way of the ruler lies in appointing the worthy and selecting ministers.
If ministers are chosen well, all officials will be upright,
and the realm will be well-governed.

But if he abandons his proper role and contests ability with his ministers,
before they can dominate him, he will already be ensnared.

Chasing horses in a race, his sinews snap before he can catch up—
once mounted, he takes the reins, and the horse obeys below.
Berlek selects the horse, Wang Liang drives it,
and the wise ruler rides it—
without effort in guiding or selecting, yet reaching a thousand *li*.
This is the art of utilizing others’ strengths.

The ruler’s Way is to act without doing,
to establish without preferring.
To act is to invite criticism;
to prefer is to invite flattery.
Criticism can be seized against him,
flattery can be used to deceive him.
He who relies on his own strength to rule cannot govern the state.

Thus, the skilled ruler does not act visibly—
his influence is formless.
Only those who embody *shen* transformation cannot be overcome.

When inner desires are restrained, it is called *jiān* (bolting);
when external evils are blocked, it is called *bì* (closing).
With inner bolting and outer closing,
what matter cannot be regulated?
With outer closing and inner bolting,
what matter cannot succeed?

Thus, without acting yet achieving,
without doing yet accomplishing—
speaking without boasting,
acting without usurping,
following names to demand reality,
letting each official attend to his duties,
taking "not knowing" as the Dao,
and making restraint the sovereign’s principle—
then all official matters will have proper measures.

To chase horses in a race is for the ruler to contend with ministers in strength;
to mount the carriage and travel far is to entrust ministers with governance.
To act is to invite debate;
to prefer is to invite flattery—
only those who embody *shen* transformation can regulate all affairs,
prevent private audiences, and ensure officials fulfill their duties with matters properly measured.

Laozi says:
Food is the people’s foundation;
the people are the state’s base.
Thus, the ruler harmonizes with Heaven’s timing,
exhausts Earth’s resources,
and employs human effort.
Therefore, all living things flourish,
and ten thousand things grow abundant.

In spring, he cuts the withered;
in summer, he harvests the fruits;
in autumn, he stores vegetables and grains;
in winter, he gathers firewood and steam.
He provides for the people—
in life, no want; in death, no abandoned corpses.

The ancient kings’ laws forbade:
hunting in groups without proper tools,
draining ponds to fish,
burning forests to hunt.
Before the jackal has sacrificed to the beasts,
no snares may traverse the wilds;
before the otter has sacrificed to the fish,
no nets may enter the waters;
before the hawk and falcon have struck,
no fowling nets may be set in the valleys;
before the grasses and trees have fallen,
no axes may enter the forests;
before insects have nested,
no fires may be set in the fields;
pregnant creatures must not be killed,
nor eggs taken from nests;
fish under a *chi* in length may not be taken,
pigs and dogs under a year may not be eaten.

Thus, all things thrive as if steamed.
This is how the ancient kings adapted to the times,
prepared thoroughly,
enriched the state,
and benefited the people.

It is not that they saw with their eyes and acted with their feet—
if benefiting the people is never forgotten in the heart,
then the people will naturally prepare themselves.

To enrich the state is to nourish the people.
The people are the foundation of life.
Harmonizing with Heaven’s timing,
exhausting Earth’s resources,
employing human effort—
the three *cai* are complete,
then all living things flourish,
ten thousand things grow abundant,
the people rely on them for sustenance,
and the state gains its wealth.

Is this not the great Way of generating wealth?

Laozi says:
In ancient times, wise rulers
took from the people with moderation,
nourished themselves with restraint,
and calculated yearly harvests,
measured the people’s stored wealth,
and knew the numbers of surplus and deficit—
then they took only what was sufficient.
Thus, they received what Heaven and Earth bestowed
and avoided hunger and cold.

To grieve with the people—
when the state has the hungry, food lacks variety;
when the people have the cold, winter lacks fur-lined robes.
Sharing their joys and sorrows,
the realm has no rebellious subjects.

But a tyrannical ruler does otherwise:
he takes from the people without regard for their strength,
demands from below without measuring their stores.
Men and women cannot tend to farming and weaving to fulfill his demands.
Exhausted in labor, depleted in wealth,
they have mornings but no evenings,
and ruler and minister grow mutually resentful.

Moreover, for a person’s livelihood,
one plowman’s labor does not increase ten *mu* of land,
and even in middle-quality fields, the yield does not exceed four *dan*.
Wives, children, the elderly, and weak depend on it for food.

The Way of governance unfolds thus:

When calamities strike and the people cannot fulfill his demands,
then the ruler pities them.
But the greedy and cruel tyrant drains his subjects like a fisherman who dries the pond,
to sate his insatiable desires—
then the common folk suffer neither the harmony of Heaven nor the virtue of Earth.

Emperor Yao ruled with compassion for his people as though they were his own,
taking from them with moderation and giving with measure—
thus no one bore ill will toward him,
and even the humblest could be ennobled.

For a wise ruler’s governance,
he must first assess the year’s abundance or scarcity,
and gauge the people’s strength or depletion—
then take accordingly.
If he serves the people without resentment,
Heaven itself will not reproach him.

The Master Lao said:
The *qi* of Heaven and Earth is nothing greater than harmony.
Harmony means the balance of yin and yang,
the division of day and night.
Thus all things sprout at the Spring Equinox and mature at the Autumn Equinox—
their growth and completion depend on the essence of harmony.

Excessive yin does not generate,
excessive yang does not transform—
only when yin and yang intermingle
does harmony emerge.
Hence the Sage’s Way is broad yet restrained,
stern yet warm,
soft yet upright,
fierce yet benevolent.

Too rigid, it breaks;
too yielding, it coils—
the true Way lies between hardness and softness.

The rule of the *guī* (plumb line) is thus:
It can be coiled and held,
unwound and stretched,
laid straight yet not rigid—
long without bending, short without exhaustion,
straight without harshness.
Therefore the Sage embodies it.

When benevolence is extended, it becomes easy—
easy without authority;
when severity is extended, it becomes fierce—
fierce without harmony;
when love is extended, it becomes indulgent—
indulgent without order;
when punishment is extended, it becomes ruinous—
ruinous without distinction.
Thus harmony is most prized.

*Qi* thrives when balanced—
Heaven and Earth in harmony, and all phenomena manifest;
yin and yang in harmony, and all things flourish;
ruler and minister in harmony, and the court is governed;
father and son in harmony, and the household prospers;
superior and subordinate in harmony, and human affairs succeed;
the *róng* (nourishing) and *wèi* (defensive) *qi* in harmony, and the body is at ease.

The meaning of harmony is vast indeed!

The Master Lao said:
The reason a state endures is because it upholds the Way;
the reason it perishes is because it obstructs *lǐ* (principle).
Thus the Sage observes transformations to discern its essence.

Virtue waxes and wanes,
the winds stir its first signs.
He who upholds the Way, though humble, will prevail;
he who shows signs of ruin, though powerful, will fall.
A state’s destruction is not due to its vastness,
the Way’s success is not due to its smallness.
Thus endurance lies in upholding the Way, not in vastness,
and ruin lies in abandoning the Way, not in smallness.

Hence rulers of chaotic states
pursue only territory and wealth,
not virtue and righteousness,
seek only high rank,
not the Way and moral power.
They abandon what sustains them
and create what destroys them.

If the ruler above disrupts the radiance of the Three Lights,
and the people below lose faith in their sovereign—
who can endure?

Therefore the prudent ruler
need not prepare against all men.

The Way that pervades the world is *Dao*,
the principle that never alters is *lǐ*.
Thus the Way and principle are the greatest.

From ancient times to now, states that uphold the Way flourish,
those that lose principle perish.
To strive for high rank and vast territory
without cultivating virtue and righteousness
is like a tree without roots—
its withering is inevitable.

In ancient times, rulers who deeply practiced the Way were called virtuous and righteous,
those who practiced it shallowly were called benevolent and righteous,
and those who practiced it superficially were called observant of rites and wise.
These six—virtue, righteousness, benevolence, rites, wisdom, and the Way—
are the cords that bind the state.

To practice them deeply brings abundant blessings,
to practice them shallowly brings meager blessings,
to practice them fully brings universal submission.

In ancient times, cultivating virtue and righteousness governed the world,
cultivating benevolence and righteousness governed a state,
and cultivating rites and wisdom governed a village.
The deeper the virtue, the greater the power;
the shallower the virtue, the lesser the power.
Thus the Way does not rely on strength or might,
nor on cunning or competition,
nor on greed or rivalry for attainment.

Its foundation lies in the world embracing you,
its victory in the world submitting to you,
its attainment in the world giving itself to you—
not in seizing it for yourself.

Hence yielding becomes strength,
softness becomes victory,
benevolence and righteousness bring true gain,
and non-contention means none can contend with you.
Thus the Way in the world
is like the rivers and seas.

Virtue, righteousness, rites, and wisdom—
rooted in the heart—
when one man practices them, there are degrees of depth and breadth,
and their application varies in weight.
Names arise from reality,
and the six are thus distinguished.

Yet though they differ,
the same goodness prevails—
when the superior is good, the inferior dare not fail to be.

Later ages neglected the cultivation of virtue and righteousness,
relying instead on coercive power to govern—
and thus their states grew perilous.

The Way of Heaven is natural;
artifice brings its loss.
Reputation is the guest of substance—
no greater name than that of a ruler.
If a ruler has virtue, his name requires no seeking,
for the world bestows it upon him.

To receive it is to embrace it.
What the world embraces is virtue.
Thus it is said:
The virtuous ruler, the world embraces;
the benevolent ruler, the land embraces;
the righteous ruler, the state embraces;
the observant of rites, the village embraces.
Without these four, the people will not embrace.
If they do not embrace, then war is used—
and war is the perilous Way.

Thus it is said:
War is an inauspicious instrument—
used only when there is no other choice.
When used, it slays and wounds men;
when victorious, do not revel in it.
Thus it is said:
In the land of death, thorns and brambles grow—
there one weeps in sorrow,
and there one dwells in mourning rites.
Hence the noble pursues virtue and righteousness,
and does not rely on heavy arms.

The Way of Heaven is natural;
artifice brings its loss.
Reputation is the guest of substance—
no greater name than that of a ruler.
If a ruler has virtue, his name requires no seeking,
for the world bestows it upon him.

To receive it is to embrace it.
This is why the Two Sovereigns and Three Kings excelled,
and why the Five Hegemons and Seven Heroes declined.
To abandon virtue and rely on arms
is to stray far from the Way of Heaven.

Wénzǐ asked:
Why are benevolence and righteousness inferior to virtue and the Way?

For those who act with righteousness, they must clarify it through giving and taking.
Within the Four Seas, sorrow and joy cannot be universal—
exhausting the treasuries’ wealth and goods is insufficient to provide for all the people.
Thus, it is known that wisdom is inferior to cultivating the Dao and practicing virtue,
following the natural disposition of Heaven and Earth,
so that all things spontaneously align,
and the world is abundantly nourished—
benevolence and righteousness then arise naturally.

Hence, the noble man dwells in substance, not in superficiality.

Ritual is the adornment of substance;
benevolence is the manifestation of kindness.
Thus, ritual conforms to human nature without exceeding its limits,
and benevolence does not exceed kindness—
sorrow and joy arise from genuine emotion,
and honoring the dead aligns with benevolence.

Wénzǐ asked how benevolence, righteousness, and ritual are inferior to virtue and the Dao.
Lǎozǐ replied:
For the benevolent, sorrow and joy must be the measure;
for the righteous, giving and taking must be clarified.

Sorrow and joy, giving and taking—
these involve artificial action.
Among the people of the world, those worthy of sorrow are many,
those worthy of joy are few;
the wealth of the treasuries, when taken, is limited,
when given, easily exhausted.
Virtue and the Dao require no artificial action,
trusting in the spontaneous alignment of all things,
and thus the world is abundantly nourished.

Nourishing life does not force what people cannot achieve,
nor does it cut off what they cannot endure.
Moderation in measure ensures nothing is lost—
then praise and blame have no cause to arise.

Thus, music is sufficient to harmonize joy,
without exceeding harmony,
clarifying the distinction between life and death,
and understanding the balance between extravagance and frugality.

But in the later ages, it is not so:
words and deeds contradict each other,
emotions and appearances oppose each other,
ritual becomes burdensome with excess,
music becomes chaotic with indulgence,
customs grow corrupt in the world,
praise and blame converge at court—
thus, the sage is abandoned and not employed.

Race a fine steed alongside a man—
the man cannot outpace the steed;
place the man upon a chariot—
the steed cannot outpace the man.
Thus, those skilled in the Dao
use what others possess to establish their achievements,
relying on their own abilities to compensate for others’ limitations.

When the ruler gives in due time, the people repay with wealth;
when the ruler meets them with ritual, the people repay with their lives.
There are nations in peril, but no secure rulers;
there are anxious sovereigns, but no joyful ministers.
When virtue exceeds one’s station, it brings honor;
when emolument exceeds one’s virtue, it brings misfortune.
Virtue’s worth is boundless, righteousness’ demands are not excessive.
To hold high station without virtue is to usurp;
to take without righteousness is to steal.

The sage finds contentment in poverty, takes joy in the Dao,
does not harm life through desire,
does not burden himself with gain,
thus does not violate righteousness to take what is unjust.

Life in the world has endured long—
those who receive their due thrive and multiply.
Thus, the worthy ruler does not force what people cannot achieve,
nor does he cut off what they cannot endure,
ensuring all people receive their due sustenance.

Therefore, to find contentment in poverty and joy in the Dao,
to not harm life through desire,
to not violate righteousness in taking what is just—
what more desire could there be?

In ancient times, without virtue, one was not honored;
without ability, one was not appointed.

The man without merit is not rewarded;
the man without crime is not punished.
In advancing men, he relies on **rites** (*lǐ* 禮);
in dismissing them, he relies on **righteousness** (*yì* 義).

In the age of the petty man,
advancing men is like the earth’s sky—boundless;
dismissing them is like the depths of a well—unfathomable.
Speaking of antiquity is but to lament the present.

In selecting horses, one errs by favoring the sour;
in choosing men, one errs by favoring the poor.
A fat pig fills the kitchen, but a lean one is not made an **official** (*guān* 官).
The **gentleman** (*jūnzǐ* 君子) discerns truth,
and does not trust slanderous words.

If a **loyal subject** (*zhōngchén* 忠臣) fails to admonish his lord’s faults,
he is not truly loyal;
if the lord does not heed admonishment,
he is not truly enlightened.

If the people sink into ruin and the ruler takes no concern,
he is not a **worthy ruler** (*xiánjūn* 賢君).
Thus, to uphold **principle** (*jié* 節) and die in hardship
is the duty of a subject;
to endure cold and hunger
is the kindness of a filial father.

To use the **great** (*dà* 大) for the **small** (*xiǎo* 小) is called **perverting men** (*biànrén* 變人);
to use the **small** for the **great** is called **defying Heaven** (*nìtiān* 逆天).
Though one may rise to the heavens in the beginning,
he will surely fall into **calamity** (*kùn* 困) in the end.

Hence, in the village,
one respects the **elderly** (*lǎo* 老) by seniority,
and does not abandon the **poor** (*qióng* 穷);
in the court,
one ranks by **noble title** (*jué* 爵),
and distinguishes **honor and lowliness** (*zūn bēi* 尊卑) with proper order.

The method of selecting officials must consider **virtue/power** (*déxíng* 德行), speech, governance, and scholarship—if one excels in any of these, he should be fit for office. If he lacks all four, then he is but a monkey adorned with a scholar’s cap.

In antiquity, those without **virtue/power** were not honored, those without ability were not appointed, those without merit were not ennobled, and those with guilt were not spared. Thus, offices were not mismatched with men, nor were men left unused.

To **cherish the noble** is to draw near the ruler;
to **honor the elderly** is to draw near one’s kin;
to **respect the elder** is to draw near one’s brother.

Those born noble grow arrogant,
those born rich grow extravagant.
Thus, if the wealthy and noble do not reflect on the **Dao/Way** with clarity,
few will refrain from wrongdoing.

To study without surfeit is to cultivate oneself;
to teach without weariness is to govern the people.
With **worthy teachers and fine friends**, few will abandon virtue.

To know the **worthy** is wisdom,
to love the **worthy** is benevolence,
to honor the **worthy** is righteousness,
to revere the **worthy** is propriety,
to delight in the **worthy** is joy.

Father and son uphold **filial virtue** (*én* 恩),
ruler and subject uphold **righteous principle** (*yì* 义).
To grasp **virtue/power** and **righteous principle** is the foundation of loyalty and filial piety.

To **cherish the noble**, honor the elderly, and respect the elder—
this is to know the roots.

If one can know, love, honor, revere, and delight in the **worthy**,
then the **Dao/Way** of seeking, nurturing, and employing the **worthy** is attained.

The ancients who governed well did nothing yet accomplished all—
thus their governance was all-encompassing.
To embrace this all-encompassing **virtue/power** (*róng* 容),
to act without doing yet achieve results;
to fail in this **virtue/power**,
every action brings calamity.

To govern with this **virtue/power** is like:
**Cautious** as one crossing a river in winter—
**Fearful** as one wary of neighbors—
**Solemn** as a guest—
**Dissolved** as melting ice—
**Unadorned** as uncarved wood—
**Mixed** as muddy water—
**Vast** as a valley.

Thus:
**Cautious** as one crossing a river in winter—
he does not dare to act rashly;
**Fearful** as one wary of neighbors—
he fears self-harm;
**Solemn** as a guest—
he is reverent and respectful;
**Dissolved** as melting ice—
he does not dare to hoard;
**Unadorned** as uncarved wood—
he does not dare to be polished;
**Mixed** as muddy water—
he does not dare to be clear;
**Vast** as a valley—
he does not dare to be full.

He who advances does not dare to act first,
he who retreats does not dare to lead—
he who fears self-harm guards **softness and weakness** without arrogance—
he who is reverent in respect humbles himself to honor others—
he who does not dare hoard diminishes himself without rigidity—
he who does not dare be polished lacks nothing yet is incomplete—
he who does not dare be clear endures filth without pride—
he who does not dare be full sees insufficiency without self-exaltation.

Thus, the **Dao/Way** retreats yet leads,
guards **softness and weakness** yet stands firm,
humbles itself yet elevates others,
diminishes itself yet remains whole,
endures filth yet remains pure,
sees insufficiency yet suffices.

The **Dao/Way** of the **worthy** is to do nothing yet accomplish all.

The **virtue/power** of the **Great Virtue** (*Kǒngdé* 孔德) follows the **Dao/Way** alone.

The ancients who governed well did nothing yet accomplished all—
the vastness of the world, the multitude of people and things,
all were contained within it.
Thus, the greatness of **non-action** (*wúwéi* 無為) is its function,
and the people of the world thus revere it without burden.

*The Chapter on Supreme Virtue***

Laozi says:
All who seek the **Dao/Way** must clearly discern the distinction between Heaven and humanity, grasp the root of order and chaos, and clarify the mind to preserve it. To perceive its beginning and end, returning to the void and emptiness—this is called enlightenment.

The root of governance lies in **virtue/power** and righteousness; its branches are laws and institutions. That which sustains life is the root; that which does not is the branch. Root and branch are one body, yet their love is dual. To prioritize the root over the branch is the **worthy**; to prioritize the branch over the root is the petty.

Laws arise to aid righteousness—yet if laws outweigh righteousness, it is like valuing one’s cap and shoes while neglecting one’s head and feet. **Virtue/power** and righteousness are vast and exalted. To extend their breadth without deepening their substance is ruin; to elevate height without broadening the foundation is collapse.

Thus, without great beams, one cannot bear great weight. To bear weight, nothing surpasses the **lignum vitae**; to govern a nation, nothing surpasses **virtue/power**.

The ruler’s relation to the people is like the foundation to a city, the roots to a tree. Deep roots mean a firm foundation; a thick base means stability above. Therefore, what lacks foundation in **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way** cannot be called doctrine; what does not align with the ancient sages cannot be called the **Dao/Way**.

To merely select techniques for single acts or deeds is not the universal **Dao/Way**. The **worthy** discerns the distinction between Heaven and humanity, grasps the root of order and chaos.

Governance has roots and branches; knowing what to prioritize brings one near to **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**. Can such methods govern the world?

Laozi says:
The **Dao/Way** of governing people is like **Zhaofu’s** driving of four horses. The reins and bit are aligned, the chest is straightened, the heart is internally harmonized, and the horses’ will is externally attuned. Thus, they follow the path, arrive far, with surplus **qi** and strength. Advance, retreat, turn, or curve—all as intended. Truly, he has mastered the technique.

Now, power and authority are the ruler’s chariot; great ministers are the four horses. The body cannot abandon the chariot’s stability, nor can the hands lose the horses’ harmony. Thus, if the four horses are not attuned, **Zhaofu** cannot take the path; if ruler and ministers are not in accord, even the sage cannot govern.

Wield the **Dao/Way** to guide them, and mediocrity can be exhausted; clarify distinctions to instruct them, and deceit can be halted. Observe changes as things arise, respond to transformations as events unfold. The near will not be disordered, and the distant will be governed.

Without contrived teachings, yet attaining the natural **Dao/Way**, all actions will be without error. Heaven and Earth are one horse; all things, one finger. The sage’s penetration to the utmost is likened to chariots and horses for power and ministers, the ruler riding upon them without exertion, conquering all without resistance—this is the method of governance.

How can one who wields the reins speak otherwise?

Laozi says:
All who practice the **Dao/Way** block the crooked paths, prevent darkness before it arises. They do not prize their own correctness but prize not doing wrong. Thus it is said:
*"Do not allow desire to arise; then there will be no daily seeking.
Do not allow what can be taken to arise; then there will be no daily contention."*

Thus, private desires are released, and the public **Dao/Way** prevails. What is in excess is restrained by measure; what is applied is sufficient, and thus the world can be unified.

If one abandons duty to listen to praise and blame, discards merit to favor factions, then odd talents flee and hide, officials neglect their posts; the people’s customs decay in the state, and ministers contend in court. Thus, with the **Dao/Way**, one governs others; without it, one is governed by others.

A skilled physician does not treat existing illness but prevents illness before it arises. Those who practice the **Dao/Way** block the crooked paths, govern what has not yet occurred—are they not like the skilled physician?

Thus, not prizing one’s own correctness but prizing not doing wrong means there will be no desire to seek what can be desired, no contention over what can be taken. Therefore, with the **Dao/Way**, one can govern others; without it, one is controlled by others.

Laozi says:
Governance of the state has constants, yet benefiting the people is the root. **Political teachings** have a **Dao/Way**, yet proper conduct is paramount. If it benefits the people, it need not conform to antiquity; if it suffices for affairs, it need not follow custom.

Thus, the sage adapts laws to the times and rites to customs. Clothing and tools are made convenient for use; laws and decrees are adapted to necessity. Therefore, altering antiquity is not wrong, nor is following custom sufficient praise.

Reciting the books of the ancient kings is not as good as hearing their words; hearing their words is not as good as understanding their intent. To grasp their intent is beyond words.

Thus, the **Dao/Way** that can be spoken is not the constant **Dao/Way**; the name that can be named is not the constant name.

The sage’s path is called the **Dao/Way**, like metal and stone—once tuned, it cannot be altered again; like the *qin* and *se*—when the melody ends, the tuning changes. Laws, institutions, rites, and music are the tools of governance, not the governance itself.

Thus, the narrow-minded cannot discuss the supreme **Dao/Way**, for they are bound by conventions and constrained by teachings.

The **Dao/Way** is the essence of law; law is the application of the **Dao/Way**. Governance of the state has constants, yet benefiting the people is the root—that is the **Dao/Way**. **Political teachings** have a **Dao/Way**, yet proper conduct is paramount—that is law.

The sage adapts laws to the times and rites to customs; laws and decrees are adapted to necessity. Thus, the narrow-minded cannot discuss the supreme **Dao/Way**, for they are bound by teachings.

Laozi says:
Is there truly a constant law in the world? What aligns with worldly affairs, accords with human nature, harmonizes with Heaven and Earth, and attends to spirits and gods—this can rectify governance.

In ancient times, the Three Sovereigns governed without laws, yet the people obeyed. The Five Emperors established laws but had no punishments. The Xia did not break their word; the Yin took oaths; the Zhou made alliances.

In the declining ages, they endured humiliation yet despised shame, coveted gain yet lacked disgrace.

The laws and decrees must be discussed in light of customs and adjusted to the urgency of the times. Tools and implements must be adapted to changing circumstances to suit their purpose.

Those who adhere strictly to laws cannot be entrusted with distant undertakings; those bound by ritual cannot be expected to respond to change. Only those with singular insight and acute hearing can then claim to embody the **Dao/Way** and act accordingly.

Those who understand the origins of law will adapt it to the times; those who do not grasp the source of governance, though they follow tradition, will only bring chaos.

Nowadays, scholars cling to ancient teachings, clutching texts and rigid doctrines, hoping to govern by them—like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. They will find it difficult to achieve what is fitting.

To preserve safety and restore order, even the wise are powerless; to uphold the **Dao/Way** by emulating antiquity, even the foolish have an advantage.

Thus, laws that are not applied, the sage does not enact; words untested, the enlightened ruler does not heed.

The sage establishes laws to prohibit deceit, redress wrongs, and protect the people. The Three Sovereigns ruled without decrees, yet the people obeyed. From the Five Emperors onward, the laws, rewards, and punishments of each dynasty differed—because the times changed.

How can an enlightened ruler fail to investigate this?

**Wénzǐ** asked: *"Where do laws originate?"*
**Laozi** replied: *"Laws arise from *yì* (proper conduct), and *yì* arises from satisfying the many. When the many are satisfied, this is the essence of governance. Laws do not descend from Heaven nor emerge from Earth; they arise among people and return to self-regulation. If one attends to the root, disorder in the branches will not occur. Knowing the essentials, one is not confused by doubts; possessing them within oneself, one does not criticize others; lacking them within oneself, one does not blame those who uphold them. Those governed below must not neglect what is above; what is forbidden to the people must not be practiced by the ruler himself. Thus, the ruler’s laws serve as his own standard. If restraint begins with the ruler, then his commands will prevail among the people."*

When **Wénzǐ** asked where laws originate, **Laozi** taught that laws arise from *yì*—what is fitting. The ancient kings established laws to suit the people’s sentiments, so they first set themselves as the standard: what they forbade among the people, they themselves dared not violate. Thus, their decrees were followed, and the world obeyed.

Laws are the measure of the world, the standard of the ruler. To countenance lawlessness is to defy law itself. Once laws are established, those who conform are rewarded, and those who deviate are punished—even the noble are not lightly rewarded, and the lowly are not harshly punished. Those who break the law, though wise, must be punished; those who conform, though unworthy, are guiltless. Thus, public virtue flourishes while private desires are curbed.

In ancient times, officials were appointed to restrain the people, preventing them from acting recklessly; rulers were established to control officials, preventing them from acting unilaterally; laws and **Dao/Way** were instituted to restrain rulers, preventing them from acting arbitrarily. When none may act recklessly, the **Dao/Way** prevails, and order is restored. Thus, it returns to *wuwei* (non-action)—not that it is inactive, but that its authority emanates from within.

Laws are the ruler’s measure, the world’s standard. Once established, they must be applied without exception: those who break the law, even if noble, must be punished; those who conform, even if lowly, are guiltless. Thus, private desires are curbed, and public virtue prevails.

In ancient times, officials were appointed, rulers established, and rites and laws instituted. When these three were not neglected, the world had no grievances, and society could return to simplicity—what need then for laws and decrees?

**Laozi** said:
*"The skilled in rewards spend little yet inspire many;
the skilled in punishments minimize penalties yet deter vice;
the skilled in giving use sparingly yet cultivate virtue;
the skilled in taking amass much yet incur no resentment.*

Thus, the sage encourages the good by aligning with what the people favor and restrains vice by addressing what they abhor. Reward one, and the world rushes to emulate; punish one, and the world fears to repeat. Hence, the greatest rewards cost nothing, and the severest punishments are never excessive. The sage governs with restraint yet achieves broad results—this is what is meant.

To give life, take life, and conceal—these are the **Dao/Way** of Heaven; to reward, punish, take, and give—these are the **Dao/Way** of humanity. The sage aligns above with Heaven’s **Dao/Way** and below with the people’s hearts, establishing the foundation for equitable governance.

Those who hold the **Dao/Way** of the world must, in every matter, act with perfect virtue. Thus, reward one, and the world rushes to emulate; punish one, and the world fears to repeat.

**Laozi** said:
*"The **Dao/Way** of the subject is to discern what is right, act first in matters, uphold duty, and clarify distinctions to achieve success. Thus, when ruler and subject differ in **Dao/Way**, order prevails; when they share the same **Dao/Way**, chaos ensues. Each must find their proper place, and all will have their due—then above and below can govern each other. Hence, branches must not surpass the trunk, nor extremities the root; speech and action must balance in weight and measure.*

Those who wield authority hold little yet bear great responsibility, adhere to strict principles yet govern broadly. A tree ten *zhàng* in girth supports a thousand-*jūn* house—this is the power of structure; a five-*cùn* hinge controls the opening and closing—this is the power of position.

Orders that must be obeyed bring benefit to those who comply and harm to those who resist—none dare disobey, for it is natural. When commands are issued and prohibitions enforced, it is through the collective force of the people.

*Yì* (proper conduct) does not seek to benefit all under Heaven; benefiting one inspires the world to follow. Tyranny does not seek to harm all within the seas; harming one provokes universal rebellion. Thus, every action and decision must be carefully considered.

The ruler depends on the subject to stand, the subject depends on the ruler to act. The ruler must act with *wuwei* above, the subject must act below. To discern what is right, uphold duty, and clarify distinctions—this is the subject’s role.

When ruler and subject each find their proper place, then above and below can govern each other, and great and small can restrain each other."*

「Thus, differing from the Dao/Way is the path to governance—every action and decision holds weight in determining order or chaos, and the ruler cannot be too cautious in his deliberations.

Laozi said: *"To bend by an inch and extend by a foot, to yield in small ways and stand upright in great ones—this is the way of the sage."* Yet, when rulers judge their subjects, they fail to weigh their grand achievements, overlook their broad impact, and instead demand minor virtues, thereby losing the path to recognizing true merit.

Hence, one with profound *德* (virtue/power) should not be faulted for trifling matters; one with great renown should not be tarnished by petty flaws. For all human nature has its shortcomings, yet what matters is their grand vision—even if they have minor faults, these do not undermine their worth. If their grand vision is lacking, then their conduct in common affairs is unremarkable.

Thus, those overly strict in small matters achieve no great success, and those who censure others’ conduct are shunned by the masses. Those who grasp the greater whole have looser small constraints; those with vast ambition earn distant praise. This is the way of judging subjects.

True full talents are rare in the world—this has always been so. The master carpenter seeks beams and pillars, not clinging to minor flaws, thus securing great materials. If a sovereign judges his ministers and advisors with the understanding of *"bending by an inch to extend by a foot,"* then great sages can be found.

Indeed, no one is flawless in all things, nor are all deeds perfect. Abandoning the small to take the great—what grand endeavor cannot be accomplished? Overlooking the short to follow the long—what matter cannot succeed?

Laozi said: *"From ancient times to today, none have been able to perfect their conduct."*

Thus, the noble does not blame others for their failings. The square does not cut itself, the sharp does not slice itself, the straight does not overstep, the broad does not belittle—when it comes to *道* (Dao/Way), *德* (virtue/power), and martial prowess, the noble does not blame others.

Cultivating oneself through the Dao/Way and not blaming others is effortless. Cultivating oneself through the Dao/Way means one will have no regrets.

The *huang* (jade) of the Xia sovereign could not be without blemishes; the pearls of the bright moon could not be without impurities. Yet the world treasures them, not allowing minor flaws to overshadow their great beauty.

Now, if one focuses on others’ shortcomings and forgets their strengths, yet still seeks to find merit in the world—this is indeed difficult. The common view holds that those of low station and humble birth, when faced with great dishonor, do not comprehend their grand vision.

Thus, the way of judging others is: observe their actions when in prosperity, their generosity when in wealth, their integrity when in poverty, and their restraint when in lowly status. See how they endure hardship to know their courage; observe their response to joy to gauge their resolve; test them with riches to measure their benevolence; frighten them to test their virtue. So, one may discern their true nature.

Those who excuse themselves do not reform their faults; those who blame others cannot maintain true friendship. The noble does not blame others, knowing that not all are Yao or Shun, and thus cannot excel in every matter. If one has great talent, how can they be discarded for minor flaws?

Laozi said: *"To bend is to seek extension; to be crooked is to seek straightness. Bending by an inch to extend by a foot, yielding in small ways to stand upright in great ones—this is the way of the noble."*

Though all streams flow together, those that do not empty into the sea are not valleys. Though all paths diverge, those that do not return to virtue are not the way of the noble. Good words are valued for their practicality; good deeds are valued for their benevolence and righteousness.

The noble’s faults are like the eclipses of the sun and moon—they do not diminish their brilliance. Thus, the wise do not act rashly, the brave do not kill recklessly. They choose what is fitting and act according to propriety, so that their deeds are accomplished and their achievements can be relied upon, and though they die, their names endure.

Even if one has wisdom and ability, they must root themselves in benevolence and righteousness to stand firm. When wisdom and ability are both cultivated, the sage uses benevolence and righteousness as the central measure—those who conform are called noble, those who do not are called petty.

Though the noble may die, their name does not perish; though the petty may gain power, their crimes are not absolved. To hold the map of all under Heaven in one hand while slaying oneself with the other—even the foolish would not do this, for life is more precious than all the world.

To face death for one’s sovereign and kin, one regards death as returning home—righteousness is heavier than life itself.

Thus, the greatest good of the world, when compared to life, is small; but life’s greatest weight, when compared to righteousness, is light. This is the measure of one who uses benevolence and righteousness as his standard.

The way of bending and extending is like the dragon and serpent in hibernation and arousal—nobles yield in small ways to stand upright in great ones, just as the dragon and serpent gather their *qi* before surging forward. Good words and good deeds nourish all living things, all arising from bending oneself to cultivate virtue.

The sage uses benevolence and righteousness as his standard, knowing that life is heavier than all the world, and righteousness is heavier than life itself. Thus, they can face death for their sovereign and kin.

Therefore, though the noble may die, their name does not vanish.

Laozi said: *"The ranks of Dao/Way and virtue/power are like the sun and moon—even the barbarians cannot alter their course."* If one’s inclinations and actions are balanced, then their reputation is not bound by common opinion; if their intentions and conduct are harmonized, then their rise or fall depends on the times.

If their deeds are complete in the world, then their achievements are fulfilled; if their efforts align with the times, then their names endure. Thus, those who establish achievements and renown are simple in the world yet meticulous in the times—when the time arrives, there is no pause for breath.

The ancient warriors did not fight for land or riches, but to preserve life and restore order, to remove harm from the people. Those greedy for wealth and power, who covet many desires, bring ruin to the world, causing the masses to be restless and never at peace.

When a sage arises, they punish the strong and violent, restore order to chaos, and remove harm from the world—turning turbidity into clarity, danger into security. Thus, they must inevitably rise and act.

The ranks of Dao/Way and virtue/power in humanity are like the sun and moon in the heavens; the five human inclinations are like the five stars. Even barbarians cannot alter their course.

Whether one follows or abandons is in their own hands, not determined by others’ opinions. Whether they are used or not depends on the times; whether they succeed or fail hinges on their fate. Thus, the noble acts in the Dao/Way when the time is right, without pause for breath.

The Vermilion Sovereign caused the fire calamity, so the Yellow Sovereign subdued him.»

共工 unleashed the water calamity, so Zhuanxu executed him.

He taught them with the Dao/Way, guided them with virtue/power, yet they refused to listen—then he confronted them with might and force. If they still did not comply, he subdued them with arms.

To slaughter the innocent and nourish the unrighteous—no greater harm exists. To exhaust the wealth of the realm for the desires of one—no deeper calamity exists. To indulge one’s own desires while prolonging the afflictions of the land—this is what the natural order rejects.

The reason kings are established is to suppress violence and chaos. Yet now, they exploit the strength of the people, only to become tyrants and bandits. How then can they not be removed? Just as one who raises fish must eliminate the otters, and one who tends beasts must eradicate the wolves—how much more so when shepherding the people?

Thus, the origin of arms and warfare.

The five phases of the state’s transformations have endured for ages. In the Fire Phase of the Vermilion Sovereign, the ruler lost his virtue/power, and fire became a calamity. In the Water Phase of共工, the ruler lost his virtue/power, and water became a calamity. Thus, it is known: when a ruler loses virtue/power, the corresponding phase brings disaster—this is the origin of arms and warfare.

All who govern lands—can they lose virtue/power and bring calamity upon themselves, yet remain unaware of warning?

Laozi said: *"The Way of governing a state is this: the sovereign issues no harsh decrees, officials impose no burdensome regulations, scholars engage in no deceitful conduct, and artisans practice no excessive craftsmanship. Their tasks are fulfilled without disturbance, their tools are complete without ornamentation.*

*Yet in chaotic times, it is otherwise: those who act seek to outdo one another in extravagance; those who uphold ritual vie in false pretension. Chariots are over-elaborated with carvings, utensils are excessively adorned with engravings. Those who seek wealth compete to hoard rare treasures as precious; those who criticize culture pursue frivolous complications as urgent. Scholars engage in false argumentation, delaying decisions endlessly without aiding governance but fostering disorder. Artisans craft bizarre devices, taking years to complete, yet they serve no practical purpose.*

*The Way of Shennong decreed: If men of prime vigor do not till the fields, there will be those who starve in the land. If women of childbearing years do not weave, there will be those who freeze. Thus, the sage himself plowed and his wife wove, setting an example for the people. He guided them, not valuing rare goods nor prizing useless objects. Therefore, the tillers did not toil excessively, yet had enough to sustain life; the weavers did not labor beyond measure, yet had enough to clothe their bodies. Neither surplus nor deficiency existed—each took only what they needed. With abundant food and clothing, deceit did not arise; with peace and ease, the realm was harmonious. The wise had no schemes to employ, the brave no valor to display. The methods of ancient and modern governance differ because customs change.*

*In ancient times, people were pure and simple: the sovereign issued no harsh decrees, officials imposed no burdensome regulations, scholars engaged in no deceitful conduct, and artisans practiced no excessive craftsmanship. Thus, the people’s hearts were easily satisfied, and governance was not difficult. In later ages, customs shifted and winds changed; the sovereign’s excesses were emulated below, luxury became the norm, and greed knew no bound. Hence, the people’s hearts were hard to satisfy, and governance became arduous."*

Laozi said: *"The Way of the hegemonic king is this: he plans with strategy, he schemes with tactics. He acts with righteousness, not for mere survival, but to secure or destroy. Thus, when he hears of a neighboring ruler oppressing his people, he raises his army to their borders, accusing them of unrighteousness and reproaching their misdeeds. Upon arrival, he commands his generals: ‘Do not cut down trees, do not dig up graves, do not destroy crops, do not burn stores, do not capture civilians, do not seize livestock.’ Then he proclaims: ‘Their ruler defies heaven and earth, insults the spirits, judges unjustly, and slaughters the innocent. Heaven condemns him, and the people seek vengeance. Our army comes to abolish unrighteousness and bestow virtue/power upon them. Any who resist the heavenly order and harm the people shall be exterminated—root and branch. Those who surrender their households shall be rewarded with their households; those who surrender their neighborhoods shall be rewarded with their neighborhoods; those who surrender their districts shall be ennobled as lords of their districts. We conquer the state, but spare its people. We depose the tyrant, reform his governance, honor the virtuous, exalt the worthy, aid the orphaned and widowed, relieve the poor, release the imprisoned, and reward the meritorious.’ The people open their doors to welcome them, offering grain and provisions, fearing only that they may not arrive. A righteous army reaches the border and halts without battle. An unrighteous army arrives amid piles of corpses and flowing blood, clashing until all is lost.*

*He who fights for the land cannot achieve kingship; he who fights for himself cannot establish his merit. He who acts for others gains their support; he who acts for himself loses them. Where the multitude aids, even the weak become strong; where the multitude abandons, even the mighty perish."*

The *Wenzi* comprises twelve chapters, of which three are primary and four secondary. It encompasses both the ancient sages and the hegemons—within it lie the emperors and kings. The age of hegemony was perhaps the autumn of the times? Observing its language—*"not for mere survival, but to secure or destroy"*—one sees the spirit of revival and restoration vividly, far removed from the unrighteous deeds of later ages.

Laozi said: *"The superior ruler governs the state, orders the realm, practices benevolence and righteousness, dispenses virtue/power and favors, establishes just laws, and blocks deceitful paths. His ministers and officials are loyal, the people are harmonious, and all hearts are united in purpose. The feudal lords submit to his authority, and the four quarters revere his virtue/power. He refines governance within the ancestral temple, and repels invasions a thousand li away. His decrees issued, the realm responds in unison—this is the highest attainment.*

*In the next rank: vast lands, numerous people, a wise sovereign, capable generals, abundant wealth, strong arms, reliable discipline, clear orders. When facing equal foes, before a single blade is drawn, the enemy flees in rout—this is the secondary attainment.*

*He knows the suitability of the land, masters the advantages of terrain, understands the shifts of oppressive governance, and discerns the tactics of battle."*

To wield the blade in close combat, to face arrows and stones like rain, to carry the slain and tend the wounded—this is the lowest application of virtue/Way.

The triumph or defeat of armies lies in governance. When governance overcomes the people, the ministers submit and the soldiers grow strong. When the people overcome governance, the ministers rebel and the soldiers grow weak. When virtue/Way is sufficient to embrace the people of the realm, when undertakings are adequate to meet the realm’s crises, when appointments and promotions win the hearts of worthy scholars, and when counsel and deliberation resolve matters of weight—this is the highest virtue/Way of the military.

The *Art of War* states that the first to act is the host, the one who responds is the guest. There is a saying about warfare: *"I dare not be the host and instead be the guest,"*—meaning one must not act rashly in battle.

When use of arms is unavoidable, then just cause is supreme; the enemy’s flight is secondary, and combat itself is the lowest recourse. Laozi said: *"The reason a state grows strong is that its people are willing to die."* The reason they are willing to die is that their cause is just. The just cause succeeds because of its righteous might. Thus, to govern with *civil* means and align with *martial* force is called the way of inevitable victory; when righteous might and just cause are united, this is called strength.

In battle, when blades clash and arrows and stones fall like rain, and officers vie to lead—it is because rewards are trustworthy and punishments are clear. If a ruler regards his subjects as sons, they will serve him as fathers. If a ruler regards his subjects as brothers, they will follow him as elder siblings. If he views them as sons, he will reign over the four seas. If he views them as fathers, he will rectify the world.

If a ruler regards his subjects as brothers, he will not hesitate to die for them. If subjects serve their ruler as elder siblings, they will not hesitate to perish for him. Hence, when the bonds are those of father and son or brother and brother, such conflicts cannot be fought.

Therefore, a just ruler refines governance within and accumulates virtue/power within the ancestral temple, while repelling evil without to demonstrate his might. He observes their labor and rest to know their hunger and fullness. When battle is certain, he treats death as returning home—such is the depth of his benevolence.

There is a Way to govern the realm—why resort to arms at all? Only when there is no alternative. The soldiers of a strong state die because they are compelled by just cause. Then, would a ruler of the Way tolerate a strong state that places its people in the path of death?

If a ruler regards his subjects as sons, and they serve him as fathers, then a just ruler who refines governance and accumulates virtue/power will see his state grow strong naturally—such examples exist in the world.

**Section on Supreme Rites**

Laozi said:
In the age of the ancient True Ones, they harmonized the breath of yin and yang, and all living beings looked up to their virtue/power in harmony. At that time, all things spontaneously aligned, their essence remained hidden and pure, and the world thrived in great ease.

When the age declined to the time of Fu Xi, men grew dim and laborious, all seeking to abandon their childlike innocence and awaken to the world. Between heaven and earth, virtue became fragmented and inconsistent. When Shennong and the Yellow Emperor took leadership over the world, they established the framework of the four seasons, harmonized yin and yang, and thus all people stood in awe, straining their senses to listen and obey. Yet governance remained unbalanced.

By the time of the Xia and Shang dynasties, desires grew excessive, and wisdom was seduced by external things, so that nature and life lost their true essence. When this spread to the Zhou, refinement scattered simplicity, and they abandoned the Dao for artifice, perverting virtue into conduct. Cleverness and cunning emerged, and men mimicked the sages with deceitful learning, flaunting empty rhetoric to coerce the masses, polishing poetry and books to trade for fame. Each sought to impose their own intelligence, masking themselves in falsehoods to fit the world, thus losing the root of the great tradition.

Thus, the world has long suffered the decay of nature and life.

Therefore, the study of the True Ones seeks to restore nature through stillness, to wander the heart in emptiness. The study of the common world, however, flaunts virtue/power and exhausts nature, agitating the five viscera, recklessly acting beyond wisdom, and clamoring for fame in the world—these are the things the True Ones do not do. To exhaust nature is to sever life.

The True Ones are fixed in the intent of life and death, penetrating the logic of honor and shame. If the world praises them, they are not further encouraged; if the world condemns them, they are not further discouraged. This is the essence of attaining the Dao.

Is the "supreme rite" the five rites—auspicious, mourning, military, guest, and festive?

The ancient True Ones were the sovereigns of the primal age. At that time, all living beings were pure and simple, and the world thrived in great ease. From Fu Xi to Shennong and the Yellow Emperor, and extending to the Three Sovereigns, governance varied, and rites adapted accordingly, reaching their peak in the Warring States era. But the root was already lost.

Laozi said:
In ancient times, the sage-kings wore loose hair without collars and ruled the world. Their virtue/power gave life without taking it, gave without seizing, and the world did not reject their ways. All shared in their virtue/power. At that time, yin and yang were in harmony, and all things flourished. Birds’ nests could be reached by bending down, and wild beasts could be tethered and led.

But as the age declined, birds, beasts, insects, and serpents all became men’s adversaries. Thus, iron was cast and blades forged to repel these dangers. When people faced hardship, they sought convenience; when they encountered calamity, they devised defenses. Each used their intelligence to avoid harm and pursue benefit. Customs were not fixed, and tools were not permanent. Thus, the laws of the ancient kings were subject to change.

Therefore, it is said: *"The named is the named, but not the unchanging name."* The Five Emperors followed different Ways, yet their virtue/power covered the world. The Three Kings pursued distinct affairs, yet their names endured in posterity. This was adapting to the times.

It is like the blind musician Zhi Kuang tuning the five tones—his adjustments had no fixed measure, yet none were out of harmony. Thus, those attuned to the essence of music could compose melodies. Those who grasped the fundamental principles of compasses, squares, hooks, and cords could govern men.

Therefore, the ancient kings’ institutions, if no longer fitting, were abandoned; the customs of later ages, if beneficial, were adopted. Thus, the sages who established rites and music were not bound by rites and music, those who governed things were not bound by things, and those who made laws were not bound by laws. Hence it is said: *"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao."*

The Way of Heaven has no constancy, and the world grows ever more degenerate. In ancient times, the sovereigns wore loose hair without collars, and the world did not reject their attire. The people and creatures flourished, all sharing in their virtue/power. But as the age declined, birds, beasts, insects, and serpents all became men’s adversaries. Laws and tools adapted to the times, and thus warfare arose.

Laozi said:
In ancient times, the sage-kings looked upward to the patterns of Heaven, downward to the measures of Earth, and inward to the laws of humanity. They regulated the qi of yin and yang, harmonized the rhythms of the four seasons, and observed the suitability of hills, plains, waters, and fertile or barren lands to establish affairs and generate wealth, removing the sufferings of hunger and cold, averting the calamities of sickness and misfortune.

Within, they received the affairs of humanity to establish rites and music, practicing the Way of benevolence and righteousness to govern human relationships. They arranged the natures of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth to establish filial piety and form the family. They listened to the pure and impure tones of the five notes and the generative sequences of the six pitches to establish the obligations of ruler and subject and form the state. They observed the order of early, middle, and late in the four seasons to establish the hierarchy of elders and juniors and form the bureaucracy. They divided the lands into regions and assigned duties to govern them. They established the Grand Academy to teach—these were the fundamental principles of governance.

When the Way is attained, it is upheld; when the Way is lost, it is abandoned. Nothing in the world remains stretched without relaxation, completed without ruin—only the sage can achieve completion without decay.

Is the principle of Heaven’s unity the same as the principle of a man’s life? To know the beginning of life is to know the origin of all things, for the time before life is the time before all things.

When a man is young and then grows strong, it is like the convergence and movement of the primal unity. When he grows old, it is like the passage of an age. To know that youth transforms into strength, strength into old age, and old age into death is to understand what comes after the origin of all things.

As for those who transform without being transformed—are they not the sages alone?

When the sages first composed music, it was to return the spirit and suppress licentiousness, restoring the heart to its natural state. But as it declined, it became excessive and unreturning, indulging in sensuality without regard for proper law, spreading to later ages until it led to the fall of kingdoms.

As for their writings, they were meant to guide all affairs—so that the foolish would not forget, and the wise would record events.

When it declined, they resorted to deceit and falsehood to exonerate the guilty and condemn the innocent, putting the innocent to death.

As for their parks and preserves, they were originally established to provide for the offerings of ancestral temples and to mobilize soldiers for unexpected emergencies. But when they declined, they indulged in reckless hunting and hawking, seizing the people’s time and exhausting their strength.

As for their promotion of the worthy, it was meant to harmonize teaching and governance, to adjudicate lawsuits fairly, to place the worthy in office, and to assign the capable to their duties. Benevolence spread below, and the common people cherished virtue. But when it declined, factions and cliques formed, each advancing their own allies, abandoning the public for private gain, and elevating outsiders and insiders alike. The wicked took office, while the worthy withdrew in obscurity.

The writings of **Wénzǐ** serve as a mirror for ten thousand generations.

The original intent of the sages in establishing these institutions was:
Music, to return the spirit and suppress licentiousness;
Writings, to guide all affairs;
Parks and preserves, to provide for ancestral temple offerings;
Promotion of the worthy, to harmonize teaching and governance, and to adjudicate lawsuits fairly.

But when they declined:
Music became an indulgence in sensuality,
Writings became deceitful,
Parks and preserves became grounds for hunting,
Promotion of the worthy became factionalism,
And the wicked took office while the worthy hid away—this was inevitable.

The **Dao** of Heaven and Earth is such that extremes reverse, and excess leads to loss.
Thus, the sages addressed decay by reforming institutions, and when one method reached its end, they introduced another. Their excellence lay in harmony, their failure in expedience.

The **Dao** of the sages states:
Without cultivating ritual and righteousness, propriety and shame cannot stand. If the people lack propriety and shame, they cannot be governed. Without knowing ritual and righteousness, laws cannot be properly enforced. Without upholding the good and abandoning the base, people will not turn toward ritual and righteousness. Without laws, governance is impossible. Without knowing ritual and righteousness, laws cannot be implemented.

Laws may kill the unfilial, but they cannot make people filial. They may punish thieves, but they cannot make people virtuous.

When the sage-kings ruled above, they made their preferences and disapprovals clear to the people, using praise and blame to guide them. They honored the worthy and advanced them, while they degraded the unworthy and removed them. They enforced punishments but did not rely on them; they cultivated ritual and righteousness and entrusted governance to the virtuous.

Thus, the highest in the land were the **Three Dukes**, the highest in a state were the **Nine Ministers**, the highest in a country were the **Twenty-Seven Great Officers**, and the highest in a village were the **Eighty-One Elemental Worthies**.

The vastness of Heaven and Earth cannot stand without humanity. The exalted status of the emperor cannot be sustained without the people. The multitude of the four quarters cannot be governed without ritual, righteousness, and shame.

Therefore, the sages reformed decayed institutions and established new ones, using ritual, righteousness, and shame as the four cardinal supports. When the worthy were in their posts, ritual and righteousness flourished, and punishments were rarely used.

To surpass ten thousand people in wisdom was called **Yīng** (英),
To surpass a thousand was called **Zhì** (智),
To surpass a hundred was called **Jié** (杰),
To surpass ten was called **Háo** (豪).

One who understood the **Dao** of Heaven and Earth, and grasped the principles of human nature,
Whose breadth could embrace the multitude, whose benevolence could win the distant,
Whose wisdom could discern expedience—such a person was **Yīng** (英);

One whose virtue could teach and transform, whose conduct could uphold righteousness,
Whose trustworthiness could win the people, whose clarity could illuminate below—such a person was **Zhì** (智);

One whose conduct could serve as a model, whose wisdom could resolve doubts,
Whose trustworthiness could keep agreements, whose integrity could govern the distribution of wealth,
Whose actions were lawful, whose words were proper—such a person was **Jié** (杰);

One who fulfilled their duties without neglect, who adhered to righteousness without forming factions,
Who did not evade difficulties and did not seek unjust gain—such a person was **Háo** (豪).

The **Yīng, Zhì, Jié,** and **Háo** were placed in their respective positions according to their talents—from root to branch, from heavy to light—with the ruler leading and the people responding in harmony. Within the four seas, all hearts turned in unison, abandoning greed and vulgarity, turning toward benevolence and righteousness. In transforming the people, their influence was like the wind sweeping through the grass.

Now, if the unworthy rule over the worthy, even severe punishments cannot restrain their deceit.

The small cannot control the great, the weak cannot command the strong—this is the nature of Heaven and Earth. Thus, the sages selected the worthy to establish merit, while unworthy rulers elevated their like-minded allies. By observing whom they promote, one can discern whether a state is orderly or chaotic. By examining their factions, one can judge whether they are worthy or unworthy.

In ancient times, the method of selecting officials ranked **moral cultivation and virtue** highest, followed by **benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music**, then **writing, arithmetic, and laws**. Only then did they consider **wisdom**. Was this not the method of the **Warring States**?

The principles of governance are such that the small cannot control the great, and the weak cannot control the strong. If one relies on **balancing scales and sealed debates**, even severe punishments cannot restrain deceit.

**Lǎozǐ** said:
Those who establish ritual carve and polish human nature, forcing and restraining its spontaneity. Though the eyes desire something, ritual restrains its measure. Though the heart takes pleasure, ritual restricts it with propriety. Moving, circling, bowing, and scraping—limbs stiffen though they do not eat, wine settles though they do not drink. Externally, the body is bound; internally, the mind is troubled. The harmony of yin and yang is suppressed, and the essence of life is strained. Thus, one spends their life as a sorrowful being.

Why? Because they do not address the root of desire but only restrain its expression. They do not explore the source of joy but only prevent its indulgence. This is like caging a wild beast without blocking its path, or damning a river’s flow with one’s hands. Therefore, it is said:
*"Open the mouth of the flood, complete the task—yet the life will never be saved."*

Ritual does not eliminate desire but restrains it.
Music does not eliminate joy but regulates it.

Ritual is the standard for self-discipline and the tool to prevent vice—it is the universal path of the world.

As **Yánzǐ**’s gaze, hearing, speech, and movement adhered to ritual, keeping his heart in harmony with it, then the improper could not enter.

The proper use of ritual values **harmony** above all.
When a gentleman’s heart is full, ritual is sincere within and expressed without, naturally harmonizing with Heaven and Earth. Human relationships become harmonious, yin and yang are balanced, and all things flourish.

The ruler who makes all under Heaven fear punishment so that none dare steal—
how much better it would be to eliminate the very desire to steal!

Thus, when the use of something is known, even the greedy will decline it;
when its uselessness is unknown, even the virtuous cannot relinquish it.

The reason states perish, rulers die by others’ hands, and they become the laughingstock of the world—
it is never because of anything other than desire.

If one knows that a fan in winter and a fur in summer serve no purpose,
then all things would be reduced to dust and filth.

Thus, to stop boiling by skimming the foam only makes it worse—
one must remove the fire at its source.

The difficulty of governing theft has long persisted.
Steal a hook and you are executed; steal a kingdom and you become a feudal lord.
Thus, theft lies with the ruler, not the commoner.

If, like Yao, one’s thatched hut is left untrimmed and unhewn timber uncarved,
even rewards would not tempt theft.

To topple palaces of jade and gold, to ruin the halls of the tyrants—
the fate of Jie and Zhou—
their bodies torn apart by others, alas!

Laozi said:
*"To act in accordance with one’s nature is called the Dao;
to attain one’s innate nature is called virtue.*

When nature is lost, then benevolence is prized;
when the Dao is lost, then righteousness is prized.
Once benevolence and righteousness are established, virtue and the Dao decay.
When purity and simplicity scatter, ritual and music become ornate;
when distinctions of right and wrong take form, the people are bewildered;
when jade and pearls are treasured, the world falls into contention.

Ritual serves to distinguish the noble from the base, the high from the low;
righteousness harmonizes the relationships between ruler and minister, father and son,
brothers, husband and wife—the proper order of human affairs.

In the decadent age, ritual becomes mere formality, and acts of courtesy are called ‘righteousness’
for the sake of gain, while lords and ministers denounce one another,
and kin harbor grudges.

Thus, stagnant water breeds cannibalistic creatures,
decaying earth spawns self-devouring beasts—
ornate ritual and music give rise to deceit and falsehood.

No thing, in its use, endures without eventually decaying.
Though the Dao may be followed and virtue attained,
if the time is not right, it cannot be practiced.

Even when lords and ministers uphold righteousness,
they cannot escape mutual reproach;
when parents and children rely on affection,
they may still breed resentment.

Is this not the fixed nature of human hearts?

In the decadent age, governance does not accumulate the means of sustenance,
but instead corrupts the purity of the people, scatters their simplicity,
confuses the masses, and inverts clarity for filth.
Life and essence scatter in chaos, all for the sake of greed.
Sincerity and trust decay into arrogance and negligence,
and people lose their true nature.
Law and righteousness diverge, conduct and self-interest oppose one another,
while the rich and poor scheme against each other—
even the ruler and his servants are beyond comparison.

When one has excess, one should yield;
when one lacks, one contends.
Yielding gives rise to ritual and righteousness;
contention spawns violence and disorder.
Thus, excessive desire leads to unchecked actions,
and insatiable greed fuels endless strife.

Therefore, in an age of order, the petty man adheres to propriety
and cannot be enticed by profit;
in an age of chaos, the noble resorts to deceit
and cannot be restrained by law.

Food is essential to life—
one day without it brings hunger,
three days brings sickness,
seven days brings death.

In ancient times, states stored ten years’ worth of grain,
and thus could endure nine years of flood and seven years of drought
without the people starving.

But in the decadent age, governance does not accumulate the means of sustenance—
for rulers, consumed by desire, cannot curb their actions.
When the ruler lacks provision, he must take from below;
when the people lack sustenance, they must contend for survival.
How grave is this hunger!

Laozi said:
*"In a declining age, the ruler drills through mountains for ore,
plucks gold and jade like fruit,
harvests pearls and shells,
melts copper and iron—
yet all things wither and fail to flourish.

He flays the pregnant, burns the sacrificial grounds,
destroys nests and ruins states—
the phoenix will not alight, the qilin will not roam.
He builds wooden towers, burns forests for hunting,
drains ponds for fishing, piles earth to make mounds,
dug wells to drink from, dredges rivers to make pools,
fortifies cities as strongholds, imprisons beasts for sport—
and thus yin and yang are disrupted, the four seasons fall out of order.
Thunder and lightning are shattered, hail and frost bring ruin,
ten thousand things wither and die prematurely.
Half the crops fail, grasses and trees wither in summer,
the three great rivers run dry and cease to flow.

He demarcates mountains and rivers, setting boundaries,
counts the people, assigning quotas,
devises traps and ambushes as defenses,
regulates clothing and colors, ranks the noble and base,
distinguishes the worthy from the unworthy,
and enforces rewards and punishments—
and thus war arises, and resentment spreads.
The innocent are slaughtered, the guilty go unpunished—
this is how calamity begins.

Those who are full yet know not to stop
are condemned by Heaven, Earth, and the spirits.

When yin and yang are disrupted, the four seasons fall out of order,
thunder and lightning are shattered, hail and frost bring ruin,
ten thousand things wither and die prematurely,
and the rivers run dry—
these are the consequences of excess, the transformation of excess,
and the harm of excess.

If one cannot correct these errors,
then human misfortune from excess follows.

This is indeed something to fear.

Laozi said:
*'When the world is about to lose its nature and essence,
it is like the rise of yin energy—
the ruler is dim-witted and unclear,
the Dao is abandoned and not practiced,
virtue is extinguished and not upheld.
Actions defy Heaven, decrees contradict the seasons.
Spring and autumn shrink from harmony,
Heaven and Earth withdraw their blessings,
the ruler sits uneasily in his position,
the ministers withdraw in seclusion and remain silent,
the officials follow the ruler’s whims and abandon tradition,
they alienate their kin while flattering themselves,
flatterers scheme in secret, mimicking the ruler’s chaos,
and the people complete their ruin.
Thus, the ruler and minister grow estranged and untrusting,
kin become distant and unfaithful,
fields yield no grain, roads are deserted,
treasures lose their luster, jade becomes worthless,
tortoiseshells have no inner markings, divination fails daily,
and though the world is one in name, it is not truly united.

The feudal lords enact laws that differ in every state,
customs become perverse,
roots are uprooted, foundations abandoned,
the Five Punishments are sharpened into cruelty,
they quarrel over trifles while slaughtering half the people,
raise armies for war, assault cities, and massacre indiscriminately,
overturning the high to secure the low, deploying massive chariots,
building towering ramparts, clearing battlefields,
forcing soldiers into death traps,
clashing with stern enemies time and again—
their fame may swell, their conquests vast,
but the dead pile up by the tens of thousands,
and the old and weak perish in hunger and cold beyond count.'"

From this point onward, the world has never once known peace in life and death,
nor has it found joy in its customs.

The Yang gives birth while the Yin kills—
the two *qi* shift in turn.
The rise and fall of states are indeed fated.

Yet when the six *qi* cycles complete and one Yin begins anew,
the *flood* of *Gonggong* serves as a warning,
and for nine years, calamity ensues.
Unless a sage like *Emperor Yao*, *Emperor Shun*, or *Emperor Yu* arises,
the lineage of such rulers will be extinguished.

Thus, rise and fall are fated,
order and chaos depend on human action.

When worthy sages emerge and uphold *the Dao/Way of virtue/power*,
reinforced by the Seven *Rites of Virtue*,
they advance the near with wisdom,
win the distant with their virtue,
uniting the world into one,
with descendants succeeding in governance,
rejecting the origins of slanderous flatterers,
silencing the specious debates of petty sophists,
abolishing the harsh *Five Punishments*,
removing burdensome and oppressive affairs,
banishing the traces of idle gossip,
sealing the gates of factional cliques,
dulling sharp wit,
following great constancy,
ignoring bodily refinements,
discarding cleverness,
all things return to their roots in grand harmony.

Sages do not create the times—
they act when the times arrive without faltering,
and thus the course is never broken.

Ancient rulers established their teachings,
with the *Three Exalted Ministers* expounding the *Dao/Way*,
harmonizing *Yin-Yang* principles,
preserving what was lost,
restoring what was disordered.

When sages arise, they uphold *the Dao/Way of virtue/power*,
reinforced by the Seven *Rites of Virtue*,
dismissing treacherous flatterers,
removing burdensome and oppressive affairs,
banishing the traces of idle gossip,
sealing the gates of factional cliques,
uniting the world into one household,
with descendants succeeding in governance.

The *Laozi* said:
*"The depth of the *Gonggong flood*,
ten fathoms deep yet untainted by dust,
gold and jade within its heart manifest on the surface—
it is not shallow nor unclean.
Yet fish, turtles, serpents, and dragons cannot dwell there.
No grains grow on barren stone,
no deer roam the treeless hills—
there is no shelter nor refuge.
Thus, governance marked by severity is deemed discerning,
by ruthlessness as clarity,
by harshness as loyalty,
by scheming as merit—
such rule is like spreading wild grass,
a path to utter ruin and collapse.*

When its governance is stifling, its people are pure;
when its governance is probing, its people are depleted.

Water too clear, fish and turtles dare not enter,
for fear of the nets and traps that harm them.
Barren mountains, deer and elk refuse to dwell,
losing the shelter and protection that brings them peace.
Stone yields no grains, for it lacks the earth to root them.

In the *末世 (last age)*, rulers who govern with severity deemed as discernment,
who probe as clarity,
who oppress as loyalty,
and who scheme as merit—
such rulers are not chosen by enlightened *明主 (sages)*.

The *Laozi* said:
*"Govern with rectitude (*正*), wage war with the unexpected (*奇*).
First establish a governance that cannot be overcome,
then seek victory over enemies.
To attack a land not yet governed is like responding to fire with fire,
or water with water—
they cannot harmonize to resolve each other.

Thus, what is different is deemed the unexpected (*奇*).
The unexpected that is still is called restless (*躁*),
the unexpected in governance is called chaos (*乱*),
the unexpected in abundance is called hunger (*饥*),
the unexpected in ease is called toil (*劳*),
and the unexpected in rectitude, when met with its opposite,
is like water, fire, metal, and wood clashing in destruction—
where shall they go without being overcome?

Hence, when *德 (virtue/power)* is balanced, the many overcome the few,
when strength is matched, the wise subdue the foolish,
and when wisdom is equal, those with strategy capture the countless.

The *Book of Wenzi* begins with the *皇 (August Sovereign)* and ends with the *霸 (Hegemon)*—
its teachings on sovereign rule, kingship, and hegemony.

To govern with rectitude and wage war with the unexpected—
this is the universal principle of antiquity and the present.

Yet the *Hegemon* does otherwise:
he wages war with the unexpected,
and governs with the unexpected as well—
thus his governance becomes the unexpected itself,
and his benevolence turns to *妖 (bewitching/chaotic)*.

Alas, those who govern without rectitude,
yet make the unexpected their sole concern—
what use have they for many schemes?

The *Twelfth Chapter of the *通玄真经 (Scripture on the Perfection of the Dao)** concludes.
