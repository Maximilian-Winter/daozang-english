### **Preface to *The Supreme Lord Lao’s Explanation of the Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness***

Before the source stirs, all streams are pure;
Before the wind fans, all things are still.
Yet when streams are muddied, the clear becomes turbid;
When winds scatter, the still moves.
Such is the constant principle of things.

The Dao gives birth to the myriad beings, their nature inherently pristine—profoundly clear, utterly still, responsive and unobstructed. But when nature is swayed by emotion, losing its celestial truth, beings drift without return, sinking into the sea of suffering amid the cycles of birth and death. How pitiful!

Out of boundless compassion and skillful means, the Supreme Lord guides the lost, restoring them to their original essence so they may behold the Dao. Though the Dao cannot be transmitted through words, how few are those who perceive it with a single glance? Though the Dao cannot be taught through images, the parable of "forgetting the trap once the fish is caught" suggests it still requires some support. Thus, this scripture was composed.

This scripture’s earnest teachings begin: "Purity is the source of turbidity; stillness is the foundation of movement. If one can abide in constant purity and stillness, heaven and earth all return to them." It continues: "The spirit delights in purity, yet the heart disturbs it; the heart delights in stillness, yet desires entangle it. If one can constantly dispel desires, the heart becomes still; if one clarifies the heart, the spirit becomes pure." Further, it states: "Inwardly observe the heart—when the heart is no-heart; outwardly observe form—when form is no-form; distantly observe things—when things are no-things. Profoundly still, stillness without stillness—this is true stillness. Responding to things with true stillness, one gradually enters the true Dao." It concludes: "Though called ‘attaining the Dao,’ there is in truth nothing attained. For the sake of transforming beings, it is called ‘attaining the Dao.’" Is this not the great purport of this true scripture?

Since the Queen Mother of the West bestowed it, immortals like Ge Xuan have transmitted it, and the Perfected of the Great Mystery praised it, generations have revered and upheld it. Yet how many fools remain dull their whole lives, how many deluded never awaken—how few live up to the Supreme Lord’s compassionate and skillful intent!

Now, Master Hou of Mount Li is one who wanders beyond the mundane. Reflecting that those who comprehend this scripture’s words may transmit the sagely Dao, he has elucidated its meaning with commentary. His words are concise and easily understood; his principles are penetrating and easily practiced. Through them, one may:
- Dispel desires and extinguish the Three Poisons;
- Observe the mind and recognize emptiness;
- Banish the deluded mind of attachment;
- Admonish against the afflictions of craving.

Following the sages’ works, he illuminates and clarifies. Within his text, he states:
- "Awakening without action is right; attaining through effort is wrong."
- "Within the great Dao there are no words; within words there is no great Dao. Celestial texts and jade instructions must be transmitted orally by a master."
- "Do not cling to emptiness as emptiness; do not fixate on being as being."
- "Embrace the radiant purity of the numinous flower; return to the light of oneness."

If scholars recite and uphold this scripture without retreat, they may attain the mystery of direct perception, not waiting until after "forgetting the trap."

### **The Supreme Lord Lao’s Explanation of the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness***
**Commentary by Hou Shanyuan, the Perfected of the Great Mystery of Mount Guye**

The Lord Lao said:
**The great Dao is formless.**
That which is formless is the vast, boundless yang abyss—immeasurable and infinite, harmonizing heart and body, subtle and without limit. Thus, it is said the great Dao is formless.

*Ode:*
The great Dao is originally formless,
Formless is but a borrowed name.
Gazing, one finds no thing;
Listening closely, no sound remains.
Awakened nature penetrates the profound and still;
Nurtured spirit pierces the eye’s clarity.
The great void has no companion,
A solitary moon illumines Penglai’s isles.

**It gives birth to and nurtures heaven and earth.**
Heaven and earth possess form and image, all sustained by the Dao’s nurturance. Thus, it is said to give birth to and nurture heaven and earth.

*Ode:*
One qi gives birth to heaven and earth,
The Three Luminaries within it reside.
The four seasons divide creation,
The myriad beings attain harmony.
To comprehend the Dharma of no-birth,
Know the heart’s exhaustion beyond things.
The utmost truth shines endlessly,
Ever in communion with the Dao.

**The great Dao is without emotion.**
That the Dao is without emotion means it is profoundly non-manifest, utterly empty and without intent. The myriad beings are born and completed, spontaneously transforming without contrivance. Thus, it is said the great Dao is without emotion.

*Ode:*
Without emotion, it pervades the great Dao,
Nurturing and sustaining, fundamentally without emotion.
It grasps the flourishing of heaven and earth,
Encompasses the brightness of the cosmos.
Above, it pierces the Golden Gates’ realm;
Below, it penetrates the Nine Dark Realms.
Vast and boundless, unfathomable,
Mysteriously veiling the Jade Capital.

**It moves the sun and moon.**
The sun and moon are the Dao’s numinous radiance, the lords of human and spirit. They circulate in all directions, universally illuminating without obscurity.

*Ode:*
The great Dao clarifies the empty expanse,
The sun and moon at heaven’s edge endure.
They circulate throughout the boundless realm,
Ascending to traverse every region.
Manifesting the purity of the numinous flower,
Returning to the light of oneness.
Those who grasp this meaning,
Find the immortal land close at hand.

**The great Dao is without name.**
That which is nameless is the great Dao—penetrating the profound and subtle, the ultimate principle without end. The primordial qi of the undifferentiated origin existed before heaven and earth, inherently without name.

*Ode:*
The Dao transforms the empty body,
Provisionally given a borrowed name.
With a name, yet no form;
Without things, yet no shape.
Above, it illumines the Three Heavens;
Horizontally, it bears the Four Seas’ brightness.
Unfolding the eye of purity and stillness,
It soars like a shooting star.

**It nurtures the myriad beings.**
The great Dao, vast and formless, profoundly still and unmoving, luminous and pure, covers and shelters heaven and earth, moves the sun and moon, flows through rivers, grasps mountains and streams, contains valleys and ravines, overflows gardens and groves, ripens the five grains, and brings forth the blossoming of flowers and fruits.

All the myriad beings are born by receiving the Dao’s qi, inherently acting without contrivance, transforming spontaneously in response to the seasons. The Dao is originally formless, yet nurtures the formed. Thus it is said to nurture the myriad beings.

*Ode:*
The Dao transforms the teeming multitudes,
Spontaneously giving life to things.
Mist and radiance span ten thousand leagues,
Lush beauty illumines a thousand mountains.
Verdant fields stretch through ravines,
Pure sounds echo beneath the azure sky.
Awakening to this land of true blessing,
Here the flying immortals conceal themselves.
I know not its name.

The Most High said: I know not the name of this,
For it abides alone without hindrance,
A mechanism of supreme truth and mystery,
Without birth or extinction, without increase or decrease,
Concealing and revealing without fixed direction.
As sentient beings fail to awaken,
The Most High, in compassion, provisionally established a name.

*Ode:*
The wondrous Dao is hard to awaken to,
Yet when the mind opens, wisdom becomes numinous.
The original spirit grows from a firm root,
The empty valley bears perfect clarity.
The sea’s depths congeal radiant pearls,
The mountain’s summit blends the sun’s essence.
The sky is filled with the dawn’s precious mirror,
Its light illumining the Jade Capital.

Forcibly called the Dao.
The Dao is originally nameless.
Once given a name, it attaches to forms;
If one acts without mind, one dies into hollow emptiness.
Being and non-being give rise to each other,
Darkness and obscurity stand in opposition.
Responding to things, it manifests form,
Yet in daily use, it is never apart.

Hard to distinguish from the teachings of the true Dharma,
It is forcibly called the Dao.

*Ode:*
The Dao is originally beyond words,
Yet forcibly named to distinguish it.
When the mind is clear, refined qi congeals,
When nature is still, numinous clouds gather.
A fresh wind rises over the sea,
An ancient moon appears at the sky’s edge.
In emptiness, self and things become clear,
The ten thousand images are all embraced.

Now, the Dao possesses both clarity and turbidity.
That which is clear is vast, empty, and open,
The spirit-valley silent and void,
A single qi harmoniously surging—
Thus it is called clarity.
That which is turbid encompasses the myriad beings,
Nothing it does not contain,
Nothing it does not enter,
Permeating the world,
Penetrating even the finest hair—
Thus it is said to possess both clarity and turbidity.

*Ode:*
Clarity and turbidity determine floating and sinking,
Yin and yang operate through ancient and modern times.
The sky hangs with jade-like images,
The earth produces forests of precious trees.
Leaning in clarity upon the Cao Stream’s path,
The spirit congeals in the depths of the Dharma sea.
Only by understanding this principle
Can the heart of the Dao-person be revealed.

There is movement and stillness.
Stillness is the great Dao, silent and without mind.
Movement is the spirit’s function, responding and penetrating the mysterious.
In the interplay of movement and stillness,
The true Dao may be realized.

*Ode:*
Movement and stillness expand the Dao’s reach,
The divine elixir shoots toward the sun.
The celestial soul gathers at the Kan position,
The earthly soul enters the Li region.
From the sea’s depths, the dragon churns waves,
On the mountain’s summit, the tiger battles the azure.
Captured and returned to the vast realm,
Life and nature attain extension.

Heaven is clear, earth is turbid.
Heaven’s clarity is the primordial qi,
Filling and surging through emptiness,
Profoundly distant and utterly deep.
Earth’s turbidity gives rise to humanity,
Nothing it does not cultivate,
Nothing it does not harvest,
Bearing the filth of the myriad people—
Thus it is said that heaven is clear and earth is turbid.

*Ode:*
Earth’s qi reaches the azure sky,
Clear heaven fills the four directions.
Within lie buried ancient traces,
Above and below, new light transcends.
Those who attain return to the true path,
Silently entering the Dao’s realm.
The jade infant ascends the jeweled hall,
Gazing afar at the Miluo River.

Heaven moves, earth is still.
Movement and stillness: heaven is round, earth is square,
Thus naturally giving rise to a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations,
The stars shift, the Dipper turns,
Operating the pivot of the axis.
Earth’s stillness: wind stirs the waves,
Stupidly enduring defilement without contention—
Thus it is said that heaven moves and earth is still.

*Ode:*
Earth is still, inherently without contrivance,
The celestial pivot follows the Dipper’s handle.
Creation arises without fabrication,
Transformation unfolds with numinous mechanism.
Gazing afar, the autumn moon is bright,
Focusing the eyes, the sun’s radiance gleams.
A single yang is gathered into the crucible,
Advancing the fire to nurture the spirit-turtle.

Man is clear, woman is turbid.
Man is yang; woman is yin.
Thus they are called true yin and true yang.
This does not refer to worldly men and women,
For they are seen when not in use,
And not seen when in use.
Thus the *Virtue Classic* says:
The myriad beings all bear yin and embrace yang.
Externally yang, internally yin.
Externally, the body;
Internally, the heart and nature.
Why is this so?
Even in cultivating practitioners:
If the body is still, is this not man’s clarity?
If the heart and nature are disturbed and restless,
Is this not woman’s turbidity?

*Ode:*
Things may be still, yet the heart is not,
The body may be clear, yet nature is not.
Deluded by truth, doubting the indistinct,
With scattered intent, how can there be peace?
Returning the light to the golden crucible,
Reversing the gaze into the precious vase.
Clearly opening the Dao’s eye,
Why worry about not attaining perfection?

Man moves, woman is still.
Man’s movement is not governed by sexual union.
Movement is instability; stillness is stability.
Thus movement arises from the yang Dao,
Like parting clouds to reveal the sun,
Polishing a mirror to attain clarity.
Thus yin returns to yang—
This is called man’s movement.
Woman’s stillness means the yang Dao opens naturally,
The spirit transforms into emptiness and clarity,
Without licentiousness or deviance,
Without hatred or love,
Without greed or anger,
Without jealousy or envy,
Without arising or thought,
Without delusion or imagination—
Is this not woman’s stillness?

It is also said:
Within Li, emptiness; within Kan, fullness.
Clearly taking the fullness within Kan to transform the emptiness within Li—
This is the method of inverting yin and yang,
The practice of returning to pure yang.

*Ode:*
The method of inverting yin and yang,
Within the furnace, gathering mercury and lead.
Clear light shines upon the earth,
Crimson flames burst through the cosmos.
The white tiger reclines in the pool,
The green dragon sleeps within the fire.
Refining into the true jade countenance,
Beyond the body, the fetal immortal dances.

Descending from the root to the branches, giving rise to the myriad beings.
Descending from the root is the origin of the branches.
Virtue and the Dao are the root,
A single qi surging through emptiness,
Issuing forth the principle of spontaneity.
The myriad beings attain their root,
Nurtured without withering,
Branches and leaves flourishing.
Humans attain their root,
The spirit numinous and unfathomable,
Manifesting without fixed direction.

*Ode:*
Descending from the root, harmonious and elegant,
Following the mechanism, things arise spontaneously.

Two crimson mists arise,
A single thread of pale smoke pours forth.
The tiger drinks the golden crow’s marrow,
The dragon swallows the jade hare’s essence.
These two are the true and supreme treasures—
Those who awaken become spiritually numinous.

The clear is the source of the turbid.
When water is clear, the abyss reflects with luminous clarity,
Its form naturally manifest,
Distinct from the turbid.
This wellspring of clarity is likened to the practitioner.

*Ode:*
The heart’s abyss shines with bottomless clarity,
The Dao’s stillness mirrors the primordial throughway.
The jade gate overflows with yang essence,
The golden pass surges with boundless qi.
In harmony, they gather at the Kan palace,
In union, they are sent to the Li chamber.
Only then does the mysterious pearl descend,
Soaring heavenward, radiant as the sun.

Stillness is the foundation of movement.
Stillness is the Dao, the great void of emptiness.
The spirit, in its function, enters and exits without obstruction,
Merging with the profound and obscure as one body.
Thus it is called the foundation of movement.

*Ode:*
Silent and empty, nothing remains,
The spirit and the Dao’s essence are one.
The heavens clear, azure waves surge,
The earth still, crimson ripples well.
The four images bore through the furnace’s mouth,
The five phases enter the crucible.
Refined, the elixir glows crimson,
Consumed, one awakens to ascend the immortal palace.

If one can remain perpetually clear and still,
The heavens are ever clear and still—
Sun, moon, and stars gleam white in empty brightness.
When humans remain clear and still,
Essence, qi, and spirit settle, never scattering.
Thus it is said: one can remain perpetually clear and still.

*Ode:*
Free from the stains of desire,
Cut off from the red dust’s comings and goings.
The light of nature soars like the bright sun,
The heart’s ground floats in the vast sky.
A single qi refines the primordial image,
The twin passes temper the subtle.
Spirit and essence pierce the cosmos,
Radiance shimmering across the three thousand realms.

Heaven and earth all return.
When one is clear and still,
The spirit’s wondrous principle ascends into non-action,
Encompassing heaven and earth,
Penetrating even the tiniest speck of dust.
Thus it is said: heaven and earth all return.

*Ode:*
Abiding in stillness, dwelling in non-action,
Non-action attains the wondrous mechanism.
The toad palace races with the jade hare,
The sun’s hall hastens with the crow’s flight.
Flaring forth a thousand dazzling lights,
Bursting open ten thousand radiant forms.
Encompassing all appearances,
Heaven and earth all return.

The human spirit favors clarity, yet emotions disturb it.
The human spirit—heaven and earth’s refined qi,
Congealed into luminous brightness—
Is inherently clear and still,
Yet follows things to generate emotions,
Clinging to dust and attracting defilement.
Thus it is said: emotions disturb it.

*Ode:*
Wealth and rank veil the heart’s eye,
Glory and splendor blind the vision with dust.
Though one may gaze upon sun and moon,
The original truth remains unseen.
Serene and profound, nurturing the primordial nature,
Limpid and empty, refining the supreme spirit.
The numinous youth opens the azure peaks,
The immortal maiden rides the qilin.

The human heart favors stillness, yet desires entangle it.
The heart is the spirit’s illumination—
Inwardly known as nature,
Outwardly manifest as spirit.
The spirit is inherently clear and still,
Yet swayed by winds, it becomes disordered,
Moved by things, desires entangle it.

*Ode:*
Eyes open, the celestial jades are revealed,
Yet the human heart strays where it clings.
Clinging to emotions, desires disturb,
Chasing scenes, scenes follow in turn.
Embracing simplicity, penetrating the pure and refined,
The singular true refines the myriad images,
Merging with the great abyss in equality.

If one can constantly dispel desires, the heart naturally stills.
To dispel desires is to sever attachments, leave loved ones,
Eliminate emotions, abandon cravings,
Cast aside thoughts, forsake scheming—
Then nature is naturally still, the heart serene.

*Ode:*
Ever steadfast in guarding stillness,
The square inch nurtures the spirit’s numinosity.
Closing the door, the golden child sleeps,
Lowering the curtain, the jade infant is embraced.
Mysterious frost refines the supreme treasure,
Purple powder tempers true emotion.
The radiant mysterious pearl is formed,
Gathered to offer to the Supreme Clarity.

When the heart is settled, the spirit naturally clarifies.
Calming the heart, stabilizing the intent,
Profoundly still and limpidly clear,
Returning to the root, reverting to the origin—
Like water undisturbed.
Thus it is said: when the heart is settled, the spirit naturally clarifies.

*Ode:*
To know the spirit’s source,
Recognize emptiness before your eyes.
The heart-moon shines with limpid clarity,
The nature-light glows in perfect roundness.
Qi flourishes, connecting to the divine and sagely,
The spirit’s wind transforms into feathered immortals.
Carefree, returning to the island in the sea,
Alone, spanning the three realms.

Naturally, the six desires do not arise.
The six desires are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and intent.
"Not arising" means:
The eyes behold no colors, the spirit does not stray in sight;
The ears hear no sounds, voice and form go unheard;
The nose’s breath is harmonious, neither fragrance nor stench admitted;
The tongue savors no flavors, neither sour nor sweet relished;
The intent embraces heaven’s truth, not deluded by external scenes.
Thus it is said: the six desires return to truth, naturally not arising.

*Ode:*
Returning to truth, eliminating the six harms,
Exhausting leaks, escaping the three calamities.
Recognizing nature, the mysterious path opens,
Knowing the heart, the Dao’s eye awakens.
The wooden man roams the vast heavens,
The stone maiden plays on the immortal steps.
As the sun sets on a clear autumn night,
At the sky’s edge, the moon is embraced.

The three poisons are extinguished.
The three poisons are bodily karma, mental karma, and verbal karma.
"Extinguished" means:
Nurturing essence, qi, and spirit with goodness,
Eradicating greed, anger, and jealousy.
Thus it is said: the three poisons are extinguished.

*Ode:*
The six desires become a golden treasury,
The three calamities transform into precious pearls.
The seven emotions remain unstained,
The ten evils forever dissolved.
Wiping clean the ice terrace, it gleams,
Its radiance neither furled nor unfurled.
Embraced, one roams the earthly realm,
Alone, stepping into the clear void.

Those who cannot do so—
Fail to eliminate emotions and desires in cultivating the Dao,
Their hearts clinging to something.

*Ode:*
Unable to practice this path,
Nature reverts, doubts arise.
Sitting in meditation exhausts heart and strength,
Investigating Chan strains the spleen.
Standing and walking lack distinction,
Sitting and lying ever follow.
To see the opening of the clear eye,
The spirit’s light fills the chamber.

For the heart is not settled—
The heart-nature unsettled, disturbances abound.
The spirit wanders external scenes,
Gazing at the subtle, clinging to things.

*Ode:*
The highest good’s heart is an abyss,
Limpid and clear, reflecting the azure heavens.
Worldly emotions bring much suffering,
People are bound by karmic conditions.
Chasing waves, the true nature is deluded,
Following ripples, the root is obscured.
A single spirit returns to the bitter sea,
Ten thousand kalpas without return.

Desires are not dispelled—
A lifetime unaltered, things turn the heart.

*Ode:*
Cultivating illusions, applying effort in vain,
Diverging from the true matter.
Conditioned actions are like shadows,
Clinging to forms like drifting winds.
Things are borrowed, the heart is not;
The body is empty, nature is not.

A single spirit knows its master,
And the ten thousand dharmas all become clear.
The one who can dispel them
Turns amidst the ten thousand things,
The heart abides in formlessness,
Nurturing the spirit in the wondrous.

*Ode:*
Nurturing the heart, one grasps the sage’s mechanism,
Without form, it equals the void in equilibrium.
Rippling waves grow still,
The sunlit abyss stretches boundless.
Flowing through all realms,
Roaming with the power of the great spirit.
The moon illumines the cosmos with clarity,
A pure wind escorts one home.

Inwardly observe the heart—
The heart has no heart.
Return to observe the heart—
Silent, it is without heart.
This heart,
When the eyes open, the void is clear,
Reveals the true heart.
The true heart,
Profound and still, without thing,
Merges with the sun in pure oneness.
Thus is it named the heart.

*Ode:*
Returning the light, one sees the heart of heaven,
Perfect and bright, deep as the limpid azure.
The form of true reality is neither non-being,
Nor can being be sought.
Mountains and seas offer no obstruction,
Heavenly disasters and misfortunes cannot invade.
Who is the true person’s companion?
The wind and moon are their confidants.

Outwardly observe the form—
The form has no form.
Form is earth, water, fire, and wind.
This is called the body of outflows.
The body not of outflows
Is thus the true without form.
The true without form
Is like gazing at the moon in water,
Like the sky turning with pure wind,
Spirit congealed, qi gathered—
Thus may the true Dao be attained.

*Ode:*
Outwardly observing the form of outflows,
Illusion transforms into true form.
Departure and abiding leave no trace,
Serene, without the slightest pause.
Within, all is indistinct,
Inward and outward, dark and profound.
Melting like ice about to dissolve,
The depths of the sea of awakening grow clear.

Observe things from afar—
Things have no thing.
Within and without, all is empty—
What then remains at a distance?
This is the absence of things.
Within the absence of things,
There is another wondrous thing.
The sutra says: *Dimly, dimly, faintly—*
*Within it, there is a thing.*
Thus it is said: *Things have no thing.*

*Ode:*
Vast and boundless, the indistinct,
Within the crucible, scenes are fine.
The furnace door pours forth jade medicine,
The cauldron’s eye brims with golden blossoms.
Tigers encircle the luminous pearl in play,
Dragons spew ten thousand miles of rosy clouds.
Parting the clouds and mist to gaze,
One cradles the night-shining sand.

Having awakened to these three—
These three are heart, form, and thing,
Which are but emptiness.
Awakening is comprehension.

*Ode:*
A metaphor speaks of three bodies,
Yet the profound is one, without duality.
Being and non-being are both illusions,
Without care, the Dao lends support.
The Dharma-eye is the elixir cauldron,
The Gate of Heaven is the medicine furnace.
Refining, cinnabar and mercury congeal,
Poured into a single crystal flask.

Only the void is seen.
Within, without, and between—
All is unattached,
Perfectly bright, vast and unobstructed,
The heart enters non-action.
Thus it is said: *Only the void is seen.*

*Ode:*
Observing emptiness is not form,
For form is true emptiness.
Self and things both forgotten,
Only then does one know the primordial unity.
Circling endlessly without cessation,
Counting exhaustively without limit.
The heavenly net is vast,
The net of the profound covers all.

Observe emptiness—emptiness too is empty.
Observing emptiness,
The Dao is vast, without form,
The ten thousand dharmas are without shape.
Emptiness too is empty—
Spirit’s wondrous transformations,
The one body returns to the true.

*Ode:*
Radiant, it cleanses the clear sky,
The spirit roams the four seas.
Vast and obscure, it pervades heaven and earth,
Indistinct, it merges with the great void.
The moon gleams in the azure night,
The wind drifts through the emerald firmament.
Freely it traverses above and below,
North and south, east and west.

Emptiness is not clung to as emptiness.
Emptiness is not grasped,
For emptiness does not attach to being.
Being and the heart are one—
Within the Supreme Ultimate,
Mystery gathers in the wondrous.

*Ode:*
Boundless, without corner,
Darkly, transformation operates in the void.
Without form, it is called the great Dao,
Beyond form, it is named true suchness.
One body, without distinction,
The three illuminations have their abode.
Vastly it reveals the wondrous Dharma,
The ten thousand paths of pure light unfold.

What is emptied is already without,
And the absence of absence is also without.
The heart comprehends its origin,
The nature recognizes its source—
Why cling to teachings of being and non-being?
Teachings of being and non-being
Are but provisional names.
Without provisional names,
How would the true heart be revealed?
Thus being arises from non-being.
Non-being is not a doctrine of falling into emptiness,
For non-being is replete with being,
And being is not exhausted by things.
Thus being and non-being are natural.

*Ode:*
The ultimate secret is the pure and void Dao,
Clearly knowing the midst beyond things.
Graceful, the radiance of the vast sky,
Resplendent, the brilliance of the azure void.
The cauldron shatters, the heart-pearl blazes,
The furnace opens, the sun of wisdom glows red.
Cinnabar and mercury congeal, settled,
Conveyed into the Palace of Broad Cold.

The absence of absence is already without—
Profoundly still, ever tranquil.
To know emptiness is not empty,
To grasp being yet not be bound by being—
Thus the original nature is profoundly still, ever tranquil.

*Ode:*
Profoundly still, without flaw,
Traversing the obscure, passing before the eyes like stars.
Heaven and earth, vast and replete,
The cosmos, boundless and bright.
The nature awakens, the empty heart is still,
The spirit slumbers, free from dreams’ startling.
Suddenly the ancient Dao opens,
The moon illumines the crystal city.

Stillness is not clung to as stillness—
Desire, how could it arise?
Not still, yet thus still—
Thus the celestial truth fills the eyes,
The wondrous Dao returns to its source.
Desire, how could it arise?

*Ode:*
Stillness casts all things aside,
The empty heart nurtures the vast.
The countenance is like the bright moon,
The azure eyes resemble a cold spring.
Luminous, one returns to the true essence,
Dim, the Dharma-nature is purified.
A pool of autumn water, limpid,
Ten thousand streams of pure waves, profound.

Desire does not arise—
This is true stillness.
Desire does not arise—
Purifying the mind of myriad cares,
All desires vanish,
Stillness is without desire—
Desire, how could it arise?
True stillness—
The spirit’s light, empty and radiant,
Manifests numinous clarity,
Returns to purity.

*Ode:*
The pure heart connects with the sage,
Non-action transforms into achievement.
The pearl congeals within the golden cauldron,
The treasure forms in the jade flask.
Bright as the sun in the sky,
Clear as the wind in the cave.
Void and serene, auspicious signs arise,
Light envelops the Five Luminous Palaces.

The true and constant responds to things,
The true and constant attains its nature.
Attaining its nature—
This is the true and constant wondrous Dao.
Responding to things as they arise,
Following conditions, one sees the nature,
Seeing the nature, one understands emptiness—
Thus one attains one’s nature.

*Ode:*
True stillness—stillness without doubt,
Yang’s light illumines the dim eye.
Treading the void, one fathoms wondrous principle,
Circling, one reaches the profound mechanism.
All things respond to one another,
Yet in each case, one knows nothing.
Turning to gaze—misty waves of green,
Laughing, one points the way back to the grotto-heaven.

Ever-responsive, ever-still,
Ever pure and serene.
Ever-responsive—
Seeing things, one sees the heart;
Seeing the heart, one leaves things behind;
Leaving things, one illumines emptiness—
Thus one attains the true and constant, fulfills one’s nature.

*Ode:*
Purity is the root and origin,
Within it, nature is spontaneous.
The two passes—essence dense and lush,
The one Way—qi flowing ceaselessly.
Merging, one illumines true principle,
Congealing, one awakens to the Great Mystery.
In emptiness, one knows there are images,
In response and transformation, one emerges from the primordial.

Such true stillness
Gradually enters the true Dao.
Those who diligently practice true purity and true stillness
Attain the wondrous principle of the subtle and formless,
The celestial truth beyond things.
Thus it is said: one gradually enters the true Dao.

*Ode:*
The great Dao—cold, vast, and deep,
Dawn’s light illumines all heaven.
One clarity divides creation,
Two harmonies nurture the embryonic immortal.
Nature reaches, forgetting sorrow and suffering,
The heart connects, uniting with the natural.
A touch opens the formless realm,
Returning to the root, restoring the origin.

Having entered the true Dao,
One is called “attained the Dao.”
The Dao has no name in itself—
A provisional name is given to the Dao.
Recognizing the dharma of neither birth nor death,
Refining the mortal into the sage,
Refining the sage into the spirit,
The spirit merges with qi,
Qi communicates with the primordial origin—
This is called “attained the Dao.”

*Ode:*
Attaining the Dao—profound and distant,
The immortal’s wind spreads loftily through the world.
The nine heavens—one dwells in ease,
The three seas—one roams freely.
Deeds fulfilled, the golden script confers,
Merits accomplished, the jade register records.
The spirit ascends to the azure vault,
Soaring steps traverse the cinnabar clouds.

Though called “attained the Dao,”
In truth, there is nothing attained.
Understanding yet not abiding,
Embodying function yet without form,
Taking what is yet no-thing—
Thus it is said: in truth, there is nothing attained.

*Ode:*
Delusion—separated by a thousand mountains,
Awakening—comes with not a single thing.
Taking nothing—nothing to attain,
Abandoning being—being lends support.
Being—what being remains?
Non-being—even this is but a borrowed name.
Gazing at heaven, the great Dao is clear—
A solitary wheel revealed in the open.

For the transformation of sentient beings,
One is called “attained the Dao.”
A provisional name is given,
To transform those yet unawakened,
A temporary teaching to verify fruition—
Thus it is said: in truth, there is nothing attained,
Yet in truth, there is cultivation.

*Ode:*
Attainment is not attainment,
Non-cultivation is not cultivation.
The Dao, vast, embraces the ten thousand images,
The heart is not bound by a single thread.
Earth’s po—leaps and soars in the void,
Heaven’s hun—gathered from the ocean’s depths.
This is the true and ultimate treasure—
Without awakening, one’s life is spent in vain.

Those who can awaken
May transmit the sagely Dao.
Those who awaken to the true and constant Dao
Gather all hearts to return as one,
Transforming endlessly,
Moving in and out without obstruction—
Thus one illumines the sagely Dao.

*Ode:*
The spirit’s clarity—heaven sighs in the bones,
The moon shines deep in the grotto abyss.
Split open—Jingshan’s jade revealed,
Brandished—treasures overflow from the hidden vault.
Naturally, one penetrates the sagely Dao,
Only then is the original heart made manifest.
Transformations—boundless and unfathomable,
The spirit shifts into the great tone.

The Lord Lao said:
The superior person is free from contention.
The Most High declares: The person of supreme virtue dwells in the companionless vastness of the void, where the celestial and true wondrous Dao remains still and unmoving, without dispute or litigation.

*Ode:*
The superior person knows Heaven’s mandate—
how could there be contention?
The elixir of the cinnabar field blooms,
the heart’s earth sprouts jade mushrooms.
In a quiet chamber, one sits at leisure,
roaming freely through the clear void.
The numinous youth holds the moon’s treasure,
the spirit’s function attains its full brilliance.

The inferior person delights in contention.
Clinging to the arts of guiding teachings, they stir up self and others, competing in right and wrong, giving rise to disputes.

*Ode:*
The inferior person delights in contention and force,
seeking merit and fame to make themselves known.
Why trouble with manifest forms—
better to treasure the concealment of light.
Closing the eyes, one concentrates the spirit in stillness;
opening them, one merges with the great sun.
Naturally, one knows the ancient Dao,
and the heart’s earth attains cool clarity.

Supreme virtue is without virtue.
Supreme virtue—note: In the Great Beginning, there are no images; the four limits are profoundly luminous. Knowing the heart is without heart, thus it is called "supreme virtue without virtue."

*Ode:*
Supreme virtue awakens to non-virtue,
without cultivation, one understands cultivation.
The Dao abides in the sea of perfect enlightenment,
the spirit is like a celestial boat.
Reaching the shore, one leaves birth and death;
turning from the waves, one does not return to swim.
Freely one departs beyond the void,
returning to one’s nature in the Isles of the Blessed.

Inferior virtue clings to virtue.
The person of inferior virtue clings to the arts of the lesser vehicle, enacting governance and affairs. Their virtue falls into emptiness—this is called "non-virtue." Such views forever depart from the true Dao.

*Ode:*
Inferior virtue enacts meritorious deeds,
vainly seeking manifest rewards.
Mired in emptiness, sunk in delusion,
clinging to illusions, one falls into the prison of yin.
The Great Beginning has no name,
the Mysterious Origin has its cultivation.
Turning toward yang, one sees the sun—
the spirit and qi naturally harmonize and soften.

Those who cling are not called virtuous.
The Dao is non-action, pure and still, profoundly tranquil.
Virtue is the spirit’s myriad transformations,
its essence and function abiding in constancy.
Dao and virtue blend as one—
their principle is the same.
Those who cling cling to all manner of contrived efforts.

*Ode:*
Clinging obstructs the Dharma—it is not penetration;
vainly one exhausts effort to no avail.
Contrived action deludes with false appearances,
non-action accords with true emptiness.
In the indistinct, the images of heaven and earth;
in the obscure, the traces of the cosmos.
The Supreme Clarity enacts the great Dao—
the spirit’s function lies within.

Living beings fail to attain the true Dao because of deluded minds.
They do not attain the true Dao because they cling to all manner of guiding teachings.
The deluded mind seeks lesser methods,
enacting governance and affairs,
constantly dwelling in the mind of delusion.
The true Dao is boundlessly transformative,
responding without separation,
most numinous and sagely—
its principle is natural,
not clinging to views,
not employing deluded minds.
This is called purity and stillness,
cutting off perverse views.

*Ode:*
The great Dao is not distant—
it is only obscured by the film of illusion.
Departing from the subtle, one inverts sagely wisdom;
pursuing things, one returns to demonic perversity.
When the heart is still, all obstructions cease;
when the spirit is clear, how could there be error?
A single wheel of blazing sun,
illuminates and shatters the cave’s clouds and mist.

Once there is a deluded mind, it startles the spirit.
Once the spirit is startled, the deluded mind arises—
the eyes see and the heart shifts,
the spirit does not abide in the wondrous.
The Scripture says: "Constantly without desire, observe its mystery;
constantly with desire, observe its manifestations."
Once one observes its manifestations,
the spirit is startled.

*Ode:*
Not awakening to the original spirit,
how can one speak of a body beyond the body?
Deluded conditions give rise to jealousy and ruin,
pursuing thoughts, anger and blame arise.
Forever losing the Dao of the Mysterious Origin,
constantly deluded by the primordial truth of the Great Antiquity.
Though the sun and moon shine bright,
one’s eyes are filled with red dust.

Once the spirit is startled, one clings to the myriad things.
Not abiding in the wondrous place,
observing things, one sinks into confusion and inversion,
mired in the margins and boundaries.

*Ode:*
Life and death arise from pride and excess,
transmigration comes from attachment to emotion.
Deluded conditions cause the heart to lose principle,
bound to things, the Dao is hard to accomplish.
Departing from desire, one observes the clarity of emptiness;
returning to the true, the eye’s realm becomes bright.
Moving without obstruction,
the heart’s ground is level and at peace.

Once one clings to the myriad things, desire and seeking arise.
The myriad Dharmas are not understood,
bound by the myriad things,
attached to things, emotions arise—
endless craving and love.

*Ode:*
Turning toward things, blame and seeking arise,
deluded emotions grow daily more severe.
The heart has not abandoned fame and profit,
wealth and sensuality are gathered within.
Thought after thought arises in dependence,
restlessly, one is not free.
A life is vainly spent—
how can one awaken to clear vision?

Once desire and seeking arise, so too do afflictions.
Unceasing desire and seeking bring affliction and sorrow,
returning to calamity and fault.

*Ode:*
Craving and love run deep in the six senses,
deluded emotions lead one into the forest of sins.
Anxiety and sorrow should be dispelled early,
afflictions should not be allowed to encroach.
Cultivate purity and stillness to refine body and life,
practice non-action to temper the original heart.
Fixing the gaze, observe the vast heavens—
beyond things, one sees the clear tone.

Afflictions and deluded thoughts bring sorrow to body and mind.
Receiving contrived action, one labors without merit—
the body suffers, the heart is vexed,
the nature is disordered, the spirit scattered.

*Ode:*
The greedy heart spurs a weak horse,
the unrestrained mind lets the monkey run wild.
Deluded thoughts give rise to inversion,
anxious striving brings bitter seeking.
The spirit is dull, clinging to things’ appearances;
the nature is benighted, following the flowing currents.
Turning from awakening, the numinous and bright body—
deluded and sunk for ten thousand kalpas.

Thus one suffers defilement and disgrace.
Body and mind endure sorrow,
mired in the turbidity of shame,
enduring the confusion of the erring.

*Ode:*
Perverse lust brings bodily contact,
turbidity and excess dull the heart’s emotions.
Narrowing the eyes, one supports the pure and refined;
raising the brows, one turns the azure pupils.
Spreading the net, one gathers heaven and earth’s beauty;
opening wide, the great abyss becomes clear.
Blending the images of heaven and earth,
the yang essence shines in ten thousand streams.

Wandering in the cycle of life and death,
the heart is bound to things,
turning from the correct to the perverse,
flowing and wandering in life and death.

*Ode:*
When will life and death end?
When will the wheel of transmigration cease?
Abiding in the principle of purity and stillness,
one embraces the sun’s head from dawn.
Filling the void, one hears the treasure’s weight;
illuminating the great divine continent.
Constantly sinking in the sea of suffering—
the awakened enter the sea of enlightenment,
the deluded enter the sea of suffering.
Those who constantly sink are deluded by the true source,
forever submerged in the sea of suffering.

*Ode:*
The heart’s desires—passions without end,
the body like a leaky, broken boat.
The waters deep, escape is hard to find;
life and death ride the waves’ ebb and flow.
The shore so vast—how can one gather in?
Life and death ride the waves,
the wheel of transmigration drifts with circumstance.
Deluded, sinking into the sea of suffering,
both nature and life come to an end,
forever losing the true Dao.

Failing to grasp the ultimate principle,
acting in chaos, seeking to do,
accumulating skills and surpassing others,
galloping through empty dharmas—
one forever loses the true Dao.

*Ode:*
Without discerning the true and constant Dao,
one seeks only what can be done.
The nature deluded, never settled,
the heart in turmoil, doubt arises.
The highest good is like clear water,
the numinous source vast and boundless.
The golden spring swells high,
overflowing to illuminate the celestial pool.

The true and constant Dao—
the true and constant is daily use without trace,
thus it is called the constant Dao.

*Ode:*
The spirit’s function is most true and constant,
illuminating the realm of virtue and power.
The jade crucible gathers white snow,
the golden tripod collects crimson frost.
The earth splits to reveal the seal of the heart,
the heavens open to flash the light of nature.
The numinous child returns to the ocean’s treasury,
alone resting in the crystal hall.

The awakened attain it on their own—
those who attain it do not cultivate yet cultivate,
do not act yet act.
The awakened conceal the subtle mechanism in their gaze,
illuminating the wondrous Dao,
penetrating and manifesting true emptiness.

*Ode:*
Withdrawing the mind, turning the pupils,
naturally one sees the Dharma-body.
Moving the celestial sun and moon,
knocking on the Dao to illumine heaven and earth.
The radiance of the dragon pearl gleams,
the brilliance of amber glows deep.
The jade infant sleeps in the jeweled palace,
pristine and pure, beyond the red dust.

Those who awaken to the Dao—
those who awaken open the eye of the Dao,
fully comprehending non-action.

*Ode:*
Knowing the profound, penetrating the ancient Dao,
awakening to the true and constant.
Lush and verdant, curling through the empty wilds,
mist and haze fill the great firmament.
The sun’s soul shines like gleaming snow,
the moon’s essence illuminates silver frost.
Emitting the spirit’s radiance in splendor,
round and bright, one enters the native land.

Ever pure and still—
heaven’s purity hangs with images,
earth’s stillness brings peace and tranquility.
If one can be pure and still,
the spirit accords with the great Dao,
abiding in the One, dwelling in constancy.

*Ode:*
The mind still, awareness becomes clear,
the wind arrives before the bright moon.
Pearl-like dew descends from all the heavens,
mercury levels the great earth.
The jade door reveals golden essence,
the golden gate manifests the jade infant.
Striking open the handle of the celestial Dipper,
one ascends to the star of the great sun.

The immortal Ge Xuan said: "I attained the true Dao and have recited this scripture ten thousand times. This scripture is practiced by heavenly beings and not transmitted to lesser scholars. I once received it from the Lord of Eastern Florescence, who received it from the Lord of the Golden Gates, who received it from the Queen Mother of the West. The Queen Mother of the West transmitted it orally, without written record. Now, in this world, I have written and recorded it.

The superior scholar who awakens to it ascends as an official of heaven; the middling scholar who awakens to it ranks among the immortals of the Southern Palace; the lesser scholar who attains it enjoys long years in the world, roaming the three realms, ascending through the golden gate."

The Perfected of Left Mystery said: "Those who study the Dao and uphold this scripture will have the ten celestial good spirits protect them. Then, the jade talisman guards the spirit, the golden elixir refines the form, and both form and spirit become wondrous, uniting with the Dao in truth."

The Perfected of Orthodox Unity said: "Households possessing this scripture, if they awaken to and understand it, will be free from calamities and obstacles. All sages will guard their gates, their spirits will ascend to the upper realms, and they will pay homage to the exalted ones. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, they will be received by the Lord Emperor. Those who recite and uphold it without retreat will ascend in purple clouds."

The Most High Lord Lao’s *Explication of the Scripture on Constant Purity and Stillness* concludes.
