**Preface to the True Classic of the Dao and Virtue Explained**
The Dao is the true and pure origin; its principles are most refined and clear.
Yet mortals, stirred by passions and desires, contrive countless deceits.
They cannot even preserve their own lives, much less save others from death.
The Most High Lord (太上) pities the suffering of all beings,
and thus reveals this True Scripture,
declaring that the Dao is not self-generated—all people inherently possess it—
but confusion arises from obscurations,
and thus they lose their natural harmony.
Hence, the manifest teachings earnestly instruct,
speaking with direct intimacy,
to restore purity and return to simplicity,
so that the Dao may dwell within the hearts of all.
The division into chapters and naming of titles
was the tradition of ancient instruction.

Now, the Dao encompasses Virtue (德), and Virtue harmonizes with the Dao;
to force distinctions upon Virtue is not the Dao’s way,
yet their subtle applications are unified.
When one examines them through profound principles,
what divisions remain?
Today, I take the Five-Thousand Words of the Most High Lord (太上老君) as my guiding framework,
so that the intent may be fully realized.

The principles are deep, the meanings profound;
the key lies in elucidation.
If one clings rigidly to fixed interpretations,
fearing to stray from narrow views,
they risk misleading those who seek earnest study and contemplation.
Thus, I have composed this commentary,
offering but a glimpse through a tube.

Written on the fifth day of the tenth month, the first year of Jianzhong Zhengguo (建中靖国元年).
**Volume One of the True Classic of the Dao and Virtue Explained**
Commentary by Chen Xianggu, the Chief Counselor (丞议郎).

**Chapter One**

**Chapter Two**
The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal Name.
What can be spoken is known by all;
what can be named is seen by all.
Though known and seen,
they cannot exhaust the Dao’s subtle essence.
Thus, what all know as the Dao is not the Dao,
and what all name as the Name is not the Name.

The Dao is nameless—
the origin of Heaven and Earth.
The Name is manifold—
the mother of all things.
*"Mother"* is metaphorical,
taken from its role in giving birth.
Heaven and Earth’s origin is vague and nameless,
yet once named, it gives rise to all things between them.

Observe its mystery with no desire;
observe its subtleties with desire.
To observe mystery without desire is to grasp its beginning.
To observe its limits with desire is to know its end.
Desire arises from things;
when things are exhausted, desire reaches its extreme—
then it arrives at *wuwei* (non-action).
*"Limits"* means the boundary.
When desire reaches its boundary,
it is exhausted and has nowhere further to go.
Thus, there must be a return to simplicity and purity—
how could this differ from mystery?
Therefore, observe mystery without desire,
observe limits with desire—
they are one and the same.

These two arise from the same source yet bear different names.
Through no desire, one knows the Dao’s mystery;
through desire, one knows its limits—
how could this not be the same source?
This is called *Xuan* (the Profound).
The Profound means deep and subtle—
its enlightenment lies within the heart.

The Sage knows the Dao’s beginning and end,
awakens to its myriad applications.
The common folk act daily without grasping its essence—
what else could it be but the Origin?
The Profound, again the Profound—
the gateway to all mysteries.
This is not shallow meaning.
The Dao that is not the eternal Dao,
the Name that is not the eternal Name—
its principles are most profound,
difficult to fathom,
hence: *The Profound, again the Profound—
the gateway to all mysteries.*
Not merely one thing,
it applies to governing the world,
harmonizing the state,
ordering the family,
cultivating the self—
its mystery is ever thus.

**Chapter Three**
When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,
then ugliness arises.
When all know goodness as goodness,
then evil arises.
Those sated on fine grains and meats
no longer crave the taste of porridge and millet gruel;
those clad in pure silk
no longer cherish the warmth of lambskin or cowhide.
Yet they do not realize:
the cold seek coarse hemp garments,
the hungry relish husks and chaff—
their need is but for fullness and warmth.
Thus, beauty arises from ugliness,
ugliness from beauty;
goodness from evil,
evil from goodness—
all because the heart clings to its likes and dislikes.
Where there is such a heart,
there will be such deeds.

Thus, being and non-being give rise to each other,
difficulty and ease arise together,
long and short define each other,
high and low contrast each other,
sounds harmonize,
before and after follow in sequence.
Because the heart clings to beauty and ugliness,
benefit and harm become so uneven.

Therefore, the Sage acts in *wuwei* (non-action),
teaches through *wuyan* (non-speech).
Not claiming what is done,
not burdening speech with instruction,
the Dao flows naturally,
things follow in accord—
like the four seasons moving,
and all things thriving thereby.
Things arise without complaint,
silently following the Profound Transformation,
understood without words.

Born yet not possessed,
acting yet not relying,
achieving yet not dwelling.
To dwell is shallow,
to rely is narrow,
to claim is limited.
With the Dao’s vastness thus held,
how could this not be its essential mystery?
Only by not dwelling does it not depart.
Since it cannot be dwelled upon,
nor abandoned—
if abandoned, it would vanish,
how then could its teaching flourish?

**Chapter Four**
The Dao is vast yet used without excess.
*"Vast"* means harmonious.
The Dao’s harmonious *qi* permeates Heaven and Earth,
yet does not fill itself—
speaking of its immeasurability.
Profound, it seems the origin of all things.
*"Profound"* means deep and subtle.
*"Origin"* means master.
The Dao acts without doing,
yet all things arise from its harmonious *qi*—
thus, it seems the master of all things.
Things have differing natures—
hard or soft, swift or slow,
colors, sounds—
all uneven.
Yet their allotted portions come from Nature itself:
great as mountains and rivers,
small as grasses and trees—
all share the harmonious *qi*,
its function is one.

**Chapter Five**
Dull its sharpness—
so it does not act recklessly.
Untangle its confusion—
so its motion follows principle.
Dim its brilliance—
so it does not self-illuminate.
Blend with dust—
so its traces vanish.
Deep and still, it seems to exist.
From the void arises presence,
from presence returns the void—
thus it is.

I do not know whose child it is,
yet it precedes the Sovereign.
*"Child"* refers to what arises from being—
since it cannot be named definitively,
I say I do not know whose child it is.
*"Precedes the Sovereign"* means
it begins with emptiness and ends with emptiness.

Heaven and Earth are not virtuous—
they treat all things as straw dogs.
The Sage is not virtuous—
he treats the people as straw dogs.
Great virtue is non-virtue—
thus, Heaven and Earth are not virtuous,
the Sage is not virtuous.
*"Straw"* is grass—it has nature;
*"dog"* is a domesticated beast—it has nature.
Both are things that follow the Way yet lack wisdom.
Nature is the beginning of the Way,
emotion is its end.
The Way encompasses beginning and end,
yet does not fully reveal its transformations—
thus, it is spoken of in myriad terms,
and compared to the lowly straw dog.

Between Heaven and Earth—
is it not like a bellows?
It contains without intention,
yet nothing is excluded.
Empty yet unyielding,
moving yet ever emerging—
speaking of its boundless reach.
Much speech leads to exhaustion—
better to hold to the center.
The wise value silence,
for much speech leads to exhaustion.
Silence preserves inner clarity—
thus, holding to the center is most precious.

**Chapter Six**
The valley spirit does not die—
this is called the Mysterious Female.
*"Valley"* is a metaphor.
*"Spirit"* is the unfathomable interplay of yin and yang.
Though the valley’s form is small,
it can embody the boundless void,
receiving without possessing—
its subtlety is divine.
*"Death"* means the stillness of extinction.
If its function is thus—
endless in application,
yet unseen in its presence—
how could there be a way of death?

The Mysterious Female’s gate
is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
*"Root"* means origin.
Heaven and Earth speak not,
yet the four seasons move,
all things are born—
their origin lies in the Mysterious Female’s Way,
vast and boundless, beyond measure.

Continuous as if present,
yet its use is effortless.
*"Continuous"* means unbroken.
*"As if present"*—its divine function is unseen.
*"Effortless"*—its natural Way leaves no trace of contrivance.

**Chapter Seven**
Heaven endures, Earth persists—
Heaven and Earth endure long
because they do not generate themselves.
Harmonious yet applied without self-assertion,
they do not generate all things—
thus, the greatest is not depleted,
the most harmonious is not diminished.
So their form is complete,
their Way profound—
how could they not endure?
How could they not persist?

Thus, the Sage yields his body yet leads,
sets it aside yet preserves it.
He does not claim deeds for himself,
does not monopolize himself—
having yet seeming not to have,
real yet seeming empty—
nurturing the primordial subtlety,
aligning with the Way—
thus his body is always foremost,
yet always preserved.

Is it not because he has no selfishness?
Thus he fulfills his selfishness.
*"Selfishness"* is the Way.
All things, through Heaven and Earth’s embrace,
retain their harmonious *qi*—
is this not what the Way values?
Thus he fulfills his selfishness.

**Chapter Eight**
The highest virtue resembles water.
Water’s nature:
it does not prefer purity,
nor despise filth.
Its flow fills the hollows before advancing,
its clarity is never obscured,
its moisture never fails—
this is water’s nature,
the natural Way.
Thus, the highest virtue resembles water.

Water benefits all things yet does not contend,
dwelling where others reject it—
thus it approaches the Way.
*"Benefits"*—its nourishing function below.
*"Does not contend, dwells in what is hated"*—
nothing can surpass it.
*"Resides in good ground"*—
where water gathers, the land is always good.
*"Heart is good and deep"*—
where water collects, its depths hold clarity.
*"Associates with goodness and virtue"*—
where water flows, all things thrive without harm.
*"Words are trustworthy"*—
where water moistens, there is no deceit.
*"Governance is effective"*—
where water’s force moves, all things are nourished in accordance with nature.
*"Actions are capable"*—
flowing to a hundred fathoms deep without fear,
rushing over precipices without weakening.
*"Movement is timely"*—
it flows when encountering the central plain,
stops when meeting a barrier.
It drifts with the wind,
freezes when cold.
Only because it does not contend
is it without blame.
Because it is the highest virtue,
its faults cannot be sought.

**Chapter Nine**
Clutching to fill—
it is better to stop.
Fault lies in clutching.
To clutch is to act—
to possess and guard without tipping,
it is better than holding to what is already possessed.

Plucking to sharpen—
it cannot be long preserved.
To pluck and sharpen is to exploit its advantage,
yet exhaustion must come—
how could this be a lasting Way?

Gold and jade fill the hall—
none can guard them.
A metaphor to illuminate the higher meaning.
Rich and noble yet arrogant—
they invite their own ruin.
The result of excess and sharpness.

When achievement is complete,
reputation established,
the body withdraws—
this is the Way of Heaven.

**Chapter Ten**
Nurturing the vital essence,
embracing unity—
how could it separate?
The Way values preserving truth,
nurturing simplicity.
*"Vital essence"* has form yet does not stray,
*"unity"* has function yet is most pure—
thus, *"nurturing the vital essence, embracing unity."*
Separation means failing the Way,
becoming dual.
Now I say—
how could it separate?
Is it not taught to avoid division?

Focusing the *qi* to attain softness—
can you be like an infant?

---

So then—
how could this be without flaw?

Purifying and perceiving the profound—
can you be without blemish?
Purifying like water washing,
removing like sweeping away filth,
thus the profound perception may be fully realized.
Without flaw,
this is the essence of profound perception,
hence it is taught that one must not have any blemish.

Loving the people and governing the state—
can you act without action?
Let the hundred folk say of you that it is natural,
this is the utmost of acting without action,
hence it is taught that one must not have any action.

The Heavenly Gate opens and closes—
can you be like the female?
The *qi* of Heaven is pure, clear, and luminous.
To follow things and respond to times,
the Way of opening and closing is not expressed in words,
to conceal one’s *virtue* yet not stop—
is this not being like the female?
Concealing *virtue* means its application is unyielding.
The *Sūnyīn* says:
*"Concealing virtue yet not stopping,
thus it does not descend."*

Bright and clear in all directions—
can you be without knowing?
Bright and clear in all directions,
one cannot be obscured by things,
thus there is nothing unseen,
nothing unheard.
Observing externally their forms,
illuminating internally their principles,
silently recognizing them—
no need to proclaim from house to house,
no need to spread one’s words far and wide.
This is the way of *virtue* without ostentation.

To give birth and to nurture—
giving birth yet not possessing,
doing yet not relying upon it,
lengthening yet not controlling—
this is called *profound virtue*.

Giving birth means the myriad things flow into form,
each attaining its nature and destiny.
Nurturing means fostering with the *qi* of harmony,
allowing them to fulfill their natural life and death.
The function of nurturing,
this is the governance of all under Heaven.

The myriad things give birth to sustain themselves yet do not claim possession,
thus they also do without relying upon it,
lengthening yet not controlling.
*Profound virtue* operates within the heart,
not displayed outwardly—
this is so.

**Chapter Ten**
Thirty spokes converge at a single hub,
yet its utility lies in the empty space between them—
this is the use of a wheel.
The spokes and hub illustrate the beginning of the Dao.
Its utility lies in the Dao of non-action—
this is the completion of the Dao.
The spokes and hub sustain each other,
leaving no room for anything else,
yet through the spokes and hub,
its use is boundless—
the vastness of its benefit lies in this.
Thus, its use lies in the *non-action* of the unseen.

Mold clay to make a vessel,
yet its utility lies in the empty space within—
this is the use of a vessel.
Pierce doors and windows to make a room,
yet its utility lies in the empty space within—
this is the use of a room.
These all do not claim their own function,
hence the earlier text says: *"The harmonizing *qi* is used yet may not be full."*
Thus, having is for benefit,
emptiness is for utility.
Benefit stops at the matter at hand,
utility follows the Dao.
Only the Dao is void, profound, and subtle—
invisible,
hence it is said: *"Emptiness is for utility."*

**Chapter Twelve**
The five colors blind the eyes,
the five tones deafen the ears,
the five flavors dull the palate—
greed and desires arise from these,
thus one contracts illness like this.
Chasing and galloping in hunts drives one’s heart to madness—
this is excessive movement,
flitting about without stillness,
thus madness arises within.
Rare treasures cause one to act improperly.
Greed and love produce this,
forgetting righteousness and gain,
thus one’s actions become improper.
Hence, the sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes,
thus discarding that and taking this.
Acting for the belly means filling the belly,
internally storing one’s clarity.
Not acting for the eyes means guarding against the encroachment of external influences.
That is external,
this is internal—
this is the sage’s choice.

**Chapter Thirteen**
Favor and disgrace like a sudden alarm—
when favor and disgrace come,
the emotions of sorrow and joy must arise within,
there is none who remains unmoved,
hence it is said: *"Like a sudden alarm."*
Great calamity and great virtue are like the body.
From the body, great calamity and great virtue arise,
thus it is said: *"Great calamity and great virtue are like the body."*

What is meant by favor and disgrace?
Favor is lowly,
disgrace arises from within—
enduring and bending beneath others,
this is the key of the Dao.
Favor arises from without,
relying upon others to succeed,
its seeking is endless,
thus it is lowly.
Gaining it is like an alarm,
losing it is like an alarm—
this is called *"favor and disgrace like a sudden alarm."*
This arises from the heart—
it is clear.

What is meant by *"great calamity and great virtue are like the body"*?
My reason for having great calamity
is that I have a body.
When I have no body,
what great calamity do I have?
The body is where all affairs cluster.
Knowing where they cluster,
one should not rely upon having it,
not relying upon having it,
thus the Dao becomes the profound utility of the body.
Hence, to value the body as all under Heaven,
as if one could entrust all under Heaven to it;
to love the body as all under Heaven,
as if one could commit all under Heaven to it.
Relying upon favor and having oneself for all under Heaven,
this is not the key of entrusting all under Heaven.
Relying upon love and having oneself for all under Heaven,
this is not the key of committing all under Heaven.
Thus, one does not magnify one’s own favor,
one does not heap up one’s own love—
because one cannot sustain it long or make it last.
Hence it is said: *"As if one could entrust, as if one could commit."*
This speaks of the meaning that one cannot truly entrust or commit.

**Chapter Fourteen**

「To look upon it yet not see, it is called *Qi* (夷);
to listen to it yet not hear, it is called *Xi* (希);
to grasp it yet not obtain, it is called *Wei* (微).
All are forced names given to it.
Because it is the form of the formless,
the image of the imageless.

These three cannot be summoned or invited,
so they merge into one.
To look upon it yet not see its shape,
to listen yet not hear its sound,
to grasp yet not obtain its substance—
its essence is undivided,
its meaning cannot be separated,
so it is said: *they merge into one.*

Its uppermost is not luminous (皦),
its lowermost is not obscure (昧).
It is boundless yet cannot be named,
returning to the realm of the formless.

*Luminous* refers to clarity,
*obscure* refers to concealment.
Not luminous means the Dao acts within oneself,
yet one does not reveal its workings.
Not obscure means the Dao extends to things,
yet one does not hide its principles.

This is called the form of the formless,
the image of the imageless—
this is called *huǎnghuǎng* (惚恍).
*Huǎnghuǎng* cannot be definitively named;
how does it differ from *Qi*, *Xi*, and *Wei*?

To face it, one does not see its head;
to follow it, one does not see its tail.
It cannot be summoned or questioned,
so it appears thus.

Seizing the Dao of antiquity to govern the present,
the Dao of antiquity is what was recorded above.
The Dao is singular, without past or future;
though the present differs from the past,
how could one abandon the Dao of antiquity?

To know the origin of antiquity is called *Dao Ji* (道紀).
To know the root of things in harmony with the Dao—
this has been so since antiquity.
*Ji* (紀) is the application of principle.
To know its ancient origin and grasp its natural essence—
this is the subtlety of the Dao.

**Chapter Fifteen**
The skilled practitioners of antiquity,
subtle and profound in their understanding,
penetrated what could not be perceived.
They held fast to the Dao and embraced unity,
not known by the common people,
so they were subtle and profound in their understanding,
and could not be easily recognized.

Only because they could not be recognized,
did they forcefully make themselves known:
They displayed teachings and demonstrated faith,
lest those who came later could not learn from them.
*Yu* (豫) is like crossing a river in winter—
winter waters are still and without surging currents#1,
so one is content and proceeds with ease,
the heart at peace and the journey smooth.
It is as if fearing the four neighbors—
*Yu* (犹), speaking of...」

**Chapter Fifteen (continued)**
When words are spoken as if fearing the four neighbors,
then left, right, front, and back all submit to the Dao.
The four neighbors are close at hand—
what is said must surely be heard,
so it is as if in fear.

**Standing** as if a guest,
revering the Dao’s application.

**Dissolving** as if ice about to release—
*Jiang* (将), great.
The Dao’s application is not stingy,
its fulfillment is certain—
thus it dissolves and permeates all things,
like ice’s great release.

**Solemn** as if uncarved wood—
wood is pure and undispersed in its original state.
*Solemn* means thick—
thick and not shallow,
so it is like uncarved wood.

**Vast** as if a valley—
*Vast* means emptiness.
A valley is deep and capacious.

**Mixed** as if turbid.
Not distinguishing ability or incapacity, good or evil—
like water yet to be clear.

Who can make turbid water clear by stillness?
Who can make lasting peace move by enduring?
Turbidity cannot endure—
still it, and the turbid settles while clarity arises.
Peace cannot be pushed to its limit—
endure it long enough, and motion must come,
and motion brings forth myriad affairs.
All are the natural order.

Those who preserve this Dao do not seek fullness.
*Fullness* is a metaphor for excess.
Excess in willfulness defiles the Dao,
so one must not be full.

Only by not being full
can one avoid decay while remaining whole.
The ancients practiced the Dao—
their decay never took root.
If the present age could emulate them,
would there ever be new decay?
Only fear that their adherence to the Dao was incomplete.

Those who wish to avoid decay
must simply refrain from self-indulgence.

**Chapter Sixteen**
Bring emptiness to its utmost,
guard stillness with sincerity.
*Bring* means to attain.
*Sincerity* means depth.
Emptiness is the root of the Dao.
If emptiness is pushed to its limit,
fearing it may become shallow,
one must guard it with profound stillness—
this is the subtle essence of cultivating the Dao.

When all things arise together,
I observe their return.
Things reach their limit and return—
return is born of stillness,
so one can observe all things returning to their origin.

Though myriad things exist,
how could they depart from my Dao?
All things, diverse and unharmonized,
each return to their root.
*Root* means origin.
Those who return to their root to its utmost
are all as such.

Returning to the root is stillness—
the origin is naturally pure and still,
yet things shift with their transformations.
Returning to the origin is constancy—
constancy is what is naturally assigned.
Returning to constancy is clarity—
clarity perceives the Dao’s application,
the head of all principles.
Ignorance of constancy leads to reckless action and calamity—
how could it not be calamity if one acts against the natural order and disrupts the Dao’s subtlety?

Knowing constancy brings tolerance—
resting in the original principle,
no longer competing,
what is there that cannot be tolerated?
Tolerance is universality—
universality does not disrupt the natural order,
nor does it favor private desires,
so it can tolerate all.

Universality is sovereignty—
sovereignty is exalted and vast,
governing the world as the Dao dictates.

Sovereignty is Heaven—
acting before Heaven, Heaven does not resist;
acting after Heaven, one follows Heaven’s timing—
only sovereignty can achieve this.

Heaven is the Dao—
harmonizing with Heaven,
the Dao is complete in action and stillness.

The Dao is enduring—
the Dao’s application knows no end.

Death does not harm it—
for those who practice it within themselves,
though the body may perish, the Dao never fails.
The body abides in the Dao—
death does not destroy it,
so it is said to be unharmed.

**Chapter Seventeen**
The most exalted Dao:
the common people know it exists.
This is the time of pure harmony and non-action—
the wise follow the transformations of all things.
Those who know it below
each rectify their nature and destiny,
the myriad things flow in their forms,
rectifying falsehood and enforcing order—
thus it is said: the common people know it exists.

The next level:
they are cherished and praised.
This is the time when emotions and desires arise—
without teaching and transformation, chaos would follow,
so they cherish others to make them submit,
and praise them to make them follow.

The next level:
they are feared and reviled.
This is the time when laws and decrees are enforced—
there is fear in those below,
and revilement in those above.
Those who fear avoid punishment,
those who revile lose their rectitude—
without executions, they cannot be unified.

Trust is insufficient, so there is distrust.
Once falsehood and deceit arise,
each harbors love and hatred,
trust cannot be sufficient,
so distrust follows.

Even more so with those who value speech—
the ignorant speak, the wise remain silent.
Those who lack trust
are those who prattle endlessly.

When deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,
the common people say, *"It was natural."*

Deeds accomplished mean all things follow their nature.
Affairs fulfilled mean all things attain their proper order.
This is the result of the subtle and profound Dao’s work,
so it is said: the common people say, *"It was natural."*

**Chapter Eighteen**
When the Great Dao is abandoned,
there arises benevolence and righteousness;
when wisdom emerges,
there arises great deceit;
when familial bonds are fractured,
there arises filial piety and kindness;
when the state is in chaos,
there arise loyal ministers.

This is the time when emotions and desires vie,
when right and wrong are confused.
Benevolence, righteousness, wisdom, filial piety, kindness, and loyal ministers—
these are forced names,
all arising from falsehood and deceit.
Once falsehood takes root,
it cannot help but be so—
thus the Sage preserves truth and nurtures simplicity,
using stillness to settle it,
returning to purity and returning to simplicity,
to rescue those in the world who have strayed from the Dao.

**Chapter Nineteen**
Abandon the Sage, discard wisdom—
the people’s benefit increases a hundredfold.
*Abandon* means to not use.
A hundredfold benefit means the result of knowing sufficiency.
Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness—
the people return to filial piety and kindness.
Abandon cleverness, discard profit—
thieves and robbers vanish.

These three are insufficient as mere names,
so they are assigned to their proper categories.
If one only speaks of abandoning the Sage and wisdom,
abandoning benevolence and righteousness,
abandoning cleverness and profit,
then the meaning is incomplete and the expression insufficient.

---

**Chapter Nineteen (continued)**
These three—*abandoning* to bring a hundredfold benefit to the people, *abandoning* to restore filial piety and kindness, and *abandoning* to eliminate thieves and robbers—are the essential matters.
If one *abandons* these three, yet still clings to the other three,
then the meaning is clear and the Dao is preserved.

**Chapter Twenty**
*Abandon* learning, and there will be no worries.
What the common folk know is enough to fulfill their desires and pleasures.
Those who do not know, look up to it and strive to learn.
Thus, when their desires cannot be satisfied, their worries grow manifold.
To *abandon* learning and take no action,
then one can preserve the Dao in its entirety.
What is the difference between *unconditional acceptance* (wú) and *non-action* (ā)?
How far apart are *good* and *evil*?
Learning leads to endless striving for action,
while *abandoning* learning brings clarity and self-sufficiency—
thus, it is better not to learn at all.

Hence, *unconditional acceptance* and *non-action*,
*good* and *evil*,
all return to the same origin.
Those who force distinctions between them are mistaken.
*Unconditional acceptance* and *non-action*—
is this not the perfect analogy?

What people fear, one must not fail to fear.
What they fear is *worry*.
*Worry* depletes the natural purity of Heaven,
so one must not fail to fear *worry*.

Unending is its wildness!
*Wildness* means untamed—
untamed is the state of not yet exhausting its principles,
not yet reaching its Dao—
this is why it is lamented.

The crowd bustles joyfully,
as if feasting on the grandest sacrificial offerings,
as if ascending to the Spring Platform.
This is the extreme result of learning to fulfill their desires and pleasures.

Yet I alone stand in dread—
its signs have not yet appeared—
like an infant before it is weaned.
In fear of *worry* yet doing nothing,
like the time before knowledge and desire have sprouted.
An infant has no knowledge, no desires;
once weaned, its emotions and desires begin to form—
hence the analogy of *before weaning*.

Steadfast and deep,
as if having nowhere to return to.
*Steadfast and deep*—a thick, weighty appearance.
To uphold truth and embrace simplicity,
full yet never overflowing—
is this not the very essence of *steadfast and deep*?

As if having nowhere to return to—
a state the crowd cannot comprehend.
The crowd all have excess,
while I alone seem abandoned.
*Excess*—those who are already full and overflowing.
Relying on learning brings this state,
while *abandonment* always feels insufficient—
the preciousness of the Dao lies here.

My heart is that of a great fool—
pure and unadulterated.
The greatest fool is not foolish,
for his heart is utterly pure—
thus, it is called pure and unadulterated.

The common folk are bright and discerning,
self-illuminated.

I alone am dim and murky—
concealing my brilliance.

The common folk are sharp and discerning,
relying on their own cleverness,
valuing neither forgiveness nor tolerance.
I alone am stifled and stilled—
no need to employ my cleverness or wisdom.

Sudden as if obscured,
silent—seeming to have no end.
*"Sudden as if"*—this is what cannot be fixed or sought.
Because it cannot be fixed or sought,
it seems to have no end.

The crowd all have their uses—
*"uses"* meaning they rely on learning,
never failing to seek its application.
I alone seem stubborn and vulgar—
concealing my use within,
no one easily knows it.
Externally, I appear incapable,
thus seeming stubborn and vulgar.

I alone differ from others—
for I do not follow the crowd’s learning.
Yet I cherish *seeking nourishment from the Mother*.
*"Seeking nourishment"* means filling the belly.
*"From the Mother"* means drawing the Way of *virtue’s* origin.

**Chapter Twenty:**
The bearing of *Great Virtue*—
only the Dao is followed.
*Great Virtue*—the highest virtue.
*"Bearing"* means encompassing all without exclusion.
*"Followed"* means reaching the utmost of non-resistance.
The virtue’s embrace never departs from the Dao—
this is not what lesser virtue can achieve.

The Dao as a thing—
only vague and hazy.
*"Vague and hazy"*—this is what cannot be fixed in name.
Hazy and vague—
within it are *forms*;
vague and hazy—
within it are *things*.
Profound and dark—
within it is *essence*.
This is the Dao’s most subtle mystery—
only those of *Great Virtue* can know it.
*"Forms," "things," essence*—
though they seem to take shape,
they cannot be fixed in name.
Its essence is supremely true—
within it is *truthfulness*.
Because its subtlety is genuine and unerring,
it can command belief from others.
Thus, it is said that only the Dao is followed—
the ultimate in truthfulness.

From ancient times to now,
its name never fades—
not an ordinary name,
so from ancient times to now,
it is both named and unnamed,
to observe all things.
How do I know all things are thus?
By this.

*"Observe"*—to examine as if inspecting objects before one.
*"All things"*—beauty.
When things align with the Dao,
life and death, openness and closure—
none fail to reach their full beauty.
Those who govern all beauty
do so with the bearing of *Great Virtue*—
thus it is.

**Chapter Twenty-Two:**
Bent, yet whole;
crooked, yet straight;
hollow, yet full;
worn, yet renewed;
few, yet sufficient;
many, yet confused.
Thus, the Sage holds *Oneness* for all under Heaven—
*Oneness*—neither excessive nor chaotic,
capable of bending and wholeness,
capable of crookedness and straightness,
capable of hollowness and fullness,
capable of wear and renewal,
capable of fewness and sufficiency,
capable of many and confusion.
The small is the beginning of the great,
the obscure is the flaw of the bright—
this is the natural order.
Thus, the Sage holds *Oneness* in numbers,
then expands into *forms*,
then contains without self-satisfaction,
anticipating what has not yet emerged.
If all under Heaven take this as their model,
then all will align with the Dao.

Not self-illuminating, hence enlightened;
not self-righteous, hence manifest;
not self-praising, hence effective;
not self-glorifying, hence enduring.
This is the model of holding *Oneness*.

The *Book of Documents* says:
*"Fullness invites loss; humility invites gain."*
Only those who do not contend
can the world not contend with.
Cases like *"whole through bending, straight through crookedness"*
are clear proofs of non-contention.
The world’s common folk do not know the great essentials of giving and taking,
so none can contend with them.
Was the ancient saying *"bent, yet whole"* mere empty talk?
Truly whole and returned to—
this is the utmost in trustworthiness.
Bent does not remain bent,
whole does not remain whole—
following bent brings wholeness,
only the Dao’s subtlety can do this.

**Chapter Twenty-Three:**
Sparse speech is natural.
When teachings are proclaimed,
a single word awakens understanding—
naturally aligning with the Dao.
Why use endless chatter?
Thus, speech is made sparse.
Though speech is sparse, its meaning is clear—
how else but natural?
Gales do not last the morning,
torrent rains do not last the day.
Who causes this?
Heaven and Earth.
Even Heaven and Earth cannot endure long—
how much less can mortals?
Gales and torrents illustrate the point.
Sudden and violent—
when people know the wind and rain arrive,
why must they last all morning or day?
Speech reveals the Dao—
logic follows beneath the words;
seek, and you will find—
why multiply speech?
Thus, those who follow the Dao—
those aligned with the Dao are aligned with the Dao,
those aligned with virtue are aligned with virtue,
those lost are aligned with loss.
When speaking of the Dao,
those who believe in the Dao align with it.
When speaking of virtue,
those who believe in virtue align with it.
When speaking of loss,
those who are lost align with it.
This too is natural.
Aligned with the Dao, the Dao is obtained;
aligned with virtue, virtue is obtained;
aligned with loss, loss is obtained.
Their words do not differ.
Lacking sincerity, there is no trust.
Speech is disordered and lacks principle,
so people do not believe it.

**Chapter Twenty-Four:**
The lame cannot stand,
the straddling cannot walk.
Extreme force cannot coexist—
thus, the seated cannot stand,
the straddling cannot walk.

Those who self-illuminate are not enlightened,
those who self-righteous are not manifest,
those who self-praise have no merit,
those who self-glorify do not endure.
This too cannot coexist.

Jade in the mountains makes wood moist,
deep waters birth pearls while shores remain dry—
like not self-illuminating yet enlightened,
not self-righteous yet manifest,
not self-praising yet meritorious,
not self-glorifying yet enduring.

Regarding the Dao, it says: *"excess food, superfluous actions."*
Things may hate it,
so those with the Dao do not dwell there.
*"Excess food, superfluous actions"*—
because they cannot endure.
This is the analogy for self-illumination, self-righteousness,
self-praise, and self-glorification.
*"Things"*—a general term.
If things hate it, how much more those with the Dao?
Thus, it is said: *"Those with the Dao do not dwell."*

**Chapter Twenty-Five:**
There exists a *thing*—
mixed and complete,
born before Heaven and Earth.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Six:**
Mixed and complete—
this is the analogy of the Great Dao.

The Dao has no fixed form,
yet Heaven and Earth take shape,
born from the Dao,
so its precedence before Heaven and Earth is manifest.

Silent and boundless,
it stands alone yet never alters,
circulates endlessly yet never falters—
it may be called the Mother of all things.

In the time of Mixed Completion,
the Mother is taken to mean the origin of all things.

I do not know its name;
I call it Dao.
Forcibly naming it, I say: Great.

Because it has no substantial form,
a fixed name cannot be given—
thus, I say I do not know its name,
but call it Dao.

Great—
because it encompasses all without exclusion,
thus it is called Great.

Great is called *passing* (*shì*).
*Passing*—meaning to move onward.
When it is Great, its movement is not confined to one place—
thus it is called *passing*.

*Passing* is called *far*.
Where it moves, its influence extends—
thus it is called *far*.

*Far* is called *returning*.
Far must reach its limit,
and when far reaches its limit, it returns.
Exhausting all transformations of things,
it returns to its original purity—
thus it is called *returning*.

Thus, the Dao is Great,
Heaven is Great,
Earth is Great,
and the Sage also is Great.

The Dao precedes Heaven and Earth in existence—
thus, it is first called Great.

Heaven is light and pure above,
heavy and turbid below,
born from the undifferentiated—
thus, it is next called Great, and Earth is called Great.

The Sage follows the harmony of the Dao’s essence,
reveres the generative transformations of Heaven and Earth,
and his Greatness equals that of Heaven and Earth—
thus, it is said the Sage also is Great.

Humans model themselves after Earth,
Earth models itself after Heaven,
Heaven models itself after the Dao,
The Dao models itself after Naturalness.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven:**
Heaviness is the root of lightness,
stillness is the sovereign of agitation.

Heaviness means not moving recklessly—
movement gives rise to lightness.
Stillness means harmonizing with the Dao in quietude—
abandoning stillness gives rise to agitation.

Thus, the Dao is fundamentally *wuwei*,
aligned with heaviness and stillness.

Only lightness and agitation
lie dormant, awaiting their time.

Root and sovereign—
these are the sources of their emergence.

Therefore, the virtuous person walks all day
without straying from his baggage train.
This illustrates that which he holds dear remains constant.

Though adorned with splendor,
he dwells in serene detachment—
this illustrates that his stillness finds its proper place.

How can the ruler of ten thousand chariots
make his body lighter than the world?

The ruler governs the vast realm—
he must uphold what is heavy,
dwell in what is still,
to subdue the light and restless,
to suppress the reckless and agitated.
He must not, through the indulgence of desire,
or the greed of the body,
lightly move and forget the Dao of governing the world—
thus, it is said to admonish him clearly.

Lightness leads to the loss of ministers,
agitation leads to the loss of sovereignty.

Lightness means the Dao’s teachings are not profound—
a failure of subtlety.
Agitation means governance is not thorough—
a failure of vastness.

Thus, the Way of serving above
and the virtue of ruling below
cannot be preserved.

The virtuous act leaves no trace,
its work done inwardly within the heart,
no outward display of deeds—
like tracks in the dust, none can seek
the essence of this virtue.

The virtuous speech bears no flaws,
its teachings endure, listeners preserved whole—
no blemish arises, and harmony extends
a thousand miles away—
this is the essence of virtuous speech.

The virtuous plan requires no calculations,
gain and loss follow events,
success and failure rest in the mind—
excessive scheming profits no wisdom—
this is the essence of virtuous planning.

The virtuous closure needs no bolt or bar,
for bolts and bars are tools to open and shut—
without them, nothing can be undone.
Like silent action within the heart,
words unsaid—
to spy upon its work or fathom its logic
is utterly impossible.

The virtuous binding needs no rope or knot,
yet cannot be undone.
The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"Water flows and moistens, fire seeks and dries."*
This is the ultimate of virtuous binding.

Thus, the Sage always acts to save others,
and so none are abandoned;
always acts to save things,
and so none are discarded.
To save others in the heart
does not distinguish between the wise and foolish;
to save things in the heart
does not distinguish between the beautiful and ugly—
this is the essence of the Sage’s constant virtue.

This is called **Clad in Clarity**.
Clarity sees all things and principles without omission.
Virtuous action, virtuous speech, virtuous planning,
virtuous closure, virtuous binding—
all belong to the enlightened.

Tracks, flaws, calculations, bolts and bars, ropes and knots—
these are the crutches of the dim-witted.

**Clad in Clarity** means nothing is forgotten in the heart.
Thus, the good person is the teacher of the unvirtuous;
the unvirtuous are the resources of the good.
*Resources*—that which is taken.
The good person is worthy of emulation, hence called *teacher*.
The unvirtuous serve as mirrors for sincerity—
the good also draw from them, hence called *resources*.

To not honor one’s teacher, to not cherish one’s resources—
honoring means embracing their virtue,
cherishing means delighting in their flaws—
this is not the Dao’s seed.

Even if one knows the great confusion,
this is called the **Essence of the Mysterious**.
To not honor one’s teacher, to not cherish one’s resources,
to recognize inwardly while outwardly forgetting their traces—
the common folk see this as confusion, unaware,
yet this is the Essence of the Mysterious.

Thus it is said:
Though one knows the great confusion,
this is called the Essence of the Mysterious.

---

To know the masculine and hold to the feminine,
is to become the valley of the world.
To become the valley of the world,
constant virtue does not stray—
returning to the infant.
All love to be masculine,
yet masculinity brings fullness and invites harm.
The Sage knows masculinity cannot be loved,
thus holds to the feminine—
with its yielding yet encompassing,
competing with nothing.
The analogy to the valley
lies in its boundless capacity.
Yet constant virtue does not depart,
returning to simplicity, preserving purity—
reverting to the infant’s uncarved, harmonious, effortless state.

To know the white and hold to the black,
is to become the model of the world.
To become the model of the world,
constant virtue does not err—
returning to the boundless.
To know the honored and hold to the dishonored,
is to become the valley of the world.
To become the valley of the world,
constant virtue is then complete—
returning to the uncarved.

White and black take form,
thus it is called *model*.
Honor and dishonor are without substance,
thus it is called *valley*.
Law must have limits,
though it never strays—
yet it cannot reach exhaustion,
for holding to black allows for transformation—
thus it returns to the boundless.
The valley, though empty, can contain—
yet containing risks depletion,
so constant virtue is complete.
The uncarved is the time before the Dao scatters—
thus, in discussing masculine and feminine, we speak of the infant;
in discussing white and black, of the boundless;
in discussing honor and dishonor, of the uncarved—
all return to the origin, never straying from the Dao.

When the uncarved scatters, it becomes vessels.
The Sage uses it,
and it becomes officials and leaders.
When the uncarved scatters into vessels,
it is the utmost of utility and form.
Officials and leaders are the rulers of these vessels.
Thus, great measures are not cut—
gathering vessels of great and small,
assigning talents of long and short—
when used properly, they unite;
when overused, they separate—
all this follows the natural way.
How could the Sage forcibly cut them with strength?

---

When one seeks to take the world and do so,
I see it as inevitable failure.
The *Book of Documents* says:
*"Proclaim your wisdom, act as the first sovereign,
the first sovereign acts as parent to the people."*
Is this inevitable?
The world is a divine vessel—
it cannot be made.
Speaking of the divine vessel means its uses cannot be measured.
To make it is to diminish it.
If the Dao is narrow and wisdom exhausted,
it is unfit for the divine vessel—
thus it cannot be made.
The maker ruins it, the grasper loses it.
Ruination and loss arise from making and grasping.
Thus things sometimes move, sometimes follow,
sometimes cling, sometimes blow—
sometimes strong, sometimes weak,
sometimes elevated, sometimes collapsed.
Each follows its nature,
content in its allotted place—
this is how the effortless and ungrasped unfold.

Thus the Sage avoids excess,
avoids extravagance,
avoids extravagance.
This refers to transgressing the proper measure.
How so?
Because of making and grasping,
not knowing the essence.

「Chapter 30: When the Dao assists the ruler,
it does not rely on arms to subdue the world,
and its affairs tend to return naturally.
*Assist* means to aid and support.
To aid and support the ruler in governing the world,
one must not rely on arms for coercion.

In ancient times, the Miao people defied the commands of Great Yu,
dancing with feathered weapons on both steps,
until after seven decades, the Miao were subdued—
this was the case of not relying on arms for coercion.

*Return* means to revert.
Though arms may slay and harm,
when they do not align with righteousness,
human emotions and *qi* will vie for dominance,
so that vengeance lurks in the shadows,
and grudges fester in the interstices,
day after day, month after month,
never ceasing, this is the clear proof of affairs returning naturally.

Where the army encamps,
thorns and punishments arise.
After a great army,
there will surely be years of calamity.
This illustrates the grave harm of relying on arms for coercion.

Thus the virtuous one acts decisively,
but does not dare to take strength in it.
Act decisively without boasting,
act decisively without arrogance,
act decisively without presumption.

*Virtuous* refers to one who virtuously aids the ruler.
*Decisive* means boldness, triumph, resolution, and mastery.
To act decisively is to act with boldness.
What is decisive?
It is not boasting, not arrogance, not presumption.
When decisive action is unavoidable,
this is the Dao of acting decisively without coercion.

Though one may boast without arrogance,
without arrogance, without presumption,
yet the enemy is strong and has lost the Dao even more,
then arms and warfare must be employed to restore order—
this is the unavoidable use of them.

Though victory is won through arms,
one does not take pride in it,
for when softness nurtures and strength grows old,
it is the way to welcome distant guests with grace—
this is called *not* the Dao,
and *not* the Dao means ruin is near.
This elaborates the principle of the Dao’s virtue.

Strength grows old when it cannot be further enhanced,
thus it is said to be old.
When old, it fails to generate,
thus it is said to be *not* the Dao.
When the Dao is lost, things have no foundation,
thus it is said to be ruined.
*Ruined* means cessation.
When things lack adaptability and change,
and come to a halt,
then decay and ruin follow,
which is not the Dao’s wondrous application.

**Chapter 31:**
A great army is an ill-omened instrument.
*Great* means vast.
*Ill-omened* means inauspicious.
Because it is vast yet inauspicious,
those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon it.

A gentleman values the left in peace,
but values the right in war.
The left represents *yang*,
the right represents *yin*.
*Yin* is not the proper use of the Dao.

Arms are an ill-omened instrument,
not the instrument of a gentleman.
Emphasizing this again,
it clarifies that arms are truly ill-omened,
and cannot be the instrument of a gentleman.

When arms must be used unavoidably,
one should do so with calm equanimity—
this is the Dao of acting decisively without coercion.

Victory without delight,
yet those who delight in it—
these are those who take pleasure in killing.
Arms must necessarily kill,
which is not a delightful matter.
To delight in it is to defy the virtue of cherishing life,
and to flaunt the traces of cruelty—
it is clear that arms are not the instrument of a gentleman.

Those who take pleasure in killing
cannot achieve their ambitions in the world.
He who harms others,
others will surely harm him,
and his affairs will return naturally—
thus he cannot achieve his ambitions in the world.

In auspicious matters, the left is honored;
in inauspicious matters, the right is honored.
The left general is stationed on the left,
the right general on the right—
this is to treat them with funeral rites.
When many are killed,
one laments and weeps with sorrow,
and victory is marked with funeral rites.
This means one should not seek inauspiciousness to gain auspiciousness.

To seek inauspiciousness is to follow sorrow and lamentation,
which is not what human nature delights in.
Now repeating this,
it clarifies that arms cannot be depended upon,
and that this principle is inevitable.

**Chapter 32:**
The Dao is ever nameless.
Names cannot be fixed,
so it is the nameless Dao.
It flows in transformation,
adapting to myriad uses,
never confined to one form—
thus it is called nameless.

Though simplicity is small,
the world does not dare to submit to it.
*Simplicity* refers to the Dao before its dispersion.
Before dispersion, its form is unfathomable,
so it can be described as small.
When it transforms and reaches all things,
vast and boundless, leaving none untouched—
thus the world does not dare to submit to it.
*Submit* is used to illustrate the meaning of humility.

If lords and kings could preserve simplicity,
all things would naturally come to honor them.
If they preserve the Dao in its simplicity,
pure and unadulterated,
all things will submit to its transformation,
like the Dao’s wondrous workings.

Heaven and Earth unite,
and sweet dew descends.
No one commands it,
yet it is evenly distributed.
This is the utmost harmony.
Sweet dew speaks of the harmony reaching down to all things.
No one commands it,
not because human strength can compel it.
When it is evenly distributed,
it nourishes all things without bias or partiality.

At first, there were names established;
names were already established.
Once Heaven and Earth were divided,
names came into being from that division—
there must be a beginning.
The proliferation of life,
how could it be without names to speak of?

Knowing when to stop is also knowing.
Knowing when to stop is the way to avoid peril.
When things are many and names are numerous,
it lies in knowing when to stop to govern them.
Not knowing when to stop,
things will be exhausted and blocked—
thus the danger of ruin arises.

Compare the Dao’s presence in the world
to rivers and valleys in relation to the sea.
Rivers and valleys contain the sea,
and nourish all things,
without leaving the slightest trace unfulfilled—
thus they are taken as an analogy.

**Chapter 33:**
He who knows others is wise,
he who knows himself is enlightened.
He who overcomes others has strength,
he who overcomes himself is powerful.
Wisdom and strength
are actions external to oneself.
Enlightenment and power
are actions internal to oneself.
Enlightenment means self-examination without oversight,
power means advancing the Dao with steady progress.

He who knows contentment is rich.
Gaining one without seeking two,
contentment lies in the heart—
this is how true wealth lies not in abundance.

He who acts with power has resolve.
Resolve lies in the heart;
acting with power in the great Dao also lies within—
what else is enlightenment?

He who does not lose his place endures.
Gaining his place means he is at ease in the Dao,
and at ease in the Dao means he can endure.

He who dies yet does not perish attains longevity.
Death cannot be avoided;
when form and *qi* are exhausted,
this is the common fate of all living beings.
Yet he who does not perish
is one who, through self-knowledge and self-mastery,
knows contentment and acts with power,
without losing his place—
this is the true meaning of longevity,
not to be compared with the mere hundred years of ordinary people.»

---

**Chapter 34**
The great Dao flows freely,
and yet it can be turned to the left or right.
If a person can broaden the Dao,
the Dao will not depart from him.
Take it, and it comes;
act with it, and it succeeds.
It does not go against principle,
and thus it is said that it can be turned to the left or right.

All things depend on it for life yet it does not refuse—
it does not claim its own power to give life.
When the work is done, it takes no name—
it does not boast of its own achievements.
It nourishes all things yet does not lord over them—
all things are born of the Dao; it does not claim dominion.
Its bestowal is vast indeed.

Ever without desire, it may be called *small*.
Without desire, one beholds the subtlety—
this is the Dao’s threshold.
Though it may be called *small*, its simplicity is complete.

All things return to it yet it does not claim them—
this is the true meaning of *great*.
All things return to its grace,
yet it does not serve its own deeds.
Vacant yet effective, none can fathom it,
and thus it may be called *great*.

---

**Chapter 35**
Seize the great image of the great image,
and all under heaven will come.
The great Dao’s image.
Seize it, and its course will be fulfilled—
not to cling stubbornly, but to embody it.
All under heaven follows it,
neither opposing nor contradicting.
Go forth without harm,
and peace and ease prevail.
Following its image,
conforming to its transformation,
one thus attains peace and ease,
free from peril, ruin, or calamity.

Delight and bait—
travelers stop.
Delight and bait are metaphors;
things universally desired.
Though travelers stop,
one cannot long remain in their light.
When the Dao is spoken of,
its flavor is bland and without taste.
To speak of it in detail,
one must first purify and refine—
thus its flavor cannot be sought in the bland.

See it, yet it is unseen;
hear it, yet it is unheard;
use it, yet it cannot be exhausted.
The Dao is not a constant Dao,
its name is not a constant name—
thus those with keen eyes and sharp ears
cannot apply their talents to it.
Its use lies in the heart,
its transformation reaches all things,
and with the Dao silently in motion,
how could there ever be an end?
And thus it is said that its use cannot be exhausted.

---

**Chapter 36**
When one would gather it,
one must first let it expand.
When one would weaken it,
one must first let it grow strong.
When one would ruin it,
one must first let it flourish.
When one would take it away,
one must first give it.
This is called *subtle enlightenment*.

When expansion reaches its limit,
it must contract.
When strength reaches its limit,
it must weaken.
When flourishing reaches its limit,
it must decline.
When giving reaches its limit,
it must take away—
all are the natural course of things.

The sage perceives before it happens,
knows before it arises,
and follows the light of enlightenment—
and thus it is said that this is *subtle enlightenment*.

In subtle and wondrous enlightenment,
there is nothing hidden that cannot be seen.
The views of ordinary people are hard to match.

The soft overcomes the strong.
The ancients said:
The thunder of Tai Mountain splits stone,
the water of the deep reaches the sky.
This too is the natural course of things.

A fish cannot be lifted from the depths,
nor can the state’s sharpest tools be shown to the people.
Metaphors.
A fish cannot be lifted from the depths—
just as a person cannot depart from the Dao.
One.

Sharp tools are made with the Dao.
Ordinary people crave completed works,
yet their shallow understanding cannot be revealed to the masses.

---

**Chapter 37**
The Dao ever acts without action,
yet nothing is left undone.
If lords and kings could guard it,
all things would transform of their own accord.
All things transform of their own accord—
thus nothing is left undone,
not because the Dao itself acts.

Lords and kings are those who govern all under heaven.
If they align with the Dao,
all things will follow their true nature and life,
obeying without resistance.

If they transform yet wish to act,
I shall restrain them with the nameless simplicity.
*Jiang* means "great."
To desire without bound,
to generate from love and hatred—
if not restrained, they will reverse and fall into chaos.
Simplicity is the undisturbed source of purity and unity.
The higher their desires,
the greater the need for restraint—
this is the essence of restraint.

The nameless simplicity also desires not.
The nameless simplicity is the desirelessness itself.
Desirelessness in stillness—
all under heaven will then self-correct.
Not losing the original purity and stillness,
then no filth or evil can affect all things.

「Chapter 38: The virtue/power of the superior is not virtue/power itself,
thus it truly has virtue/power.
The virtue/power of the inferior does not lose its virtue/power,
thus it truly lacks virtue/power.

The one without virtue/power refers to not boasting of his virtue/power,
so the people look up to his virtue/power and follow him.
The one who does not lose virtue/power refers to boasting of his virtue/power,
thus risking its loss.
If one fears losing it, he will go to any lengths,
so the people observe his actions and despise him.
How then can he still speak of virtue/power?

*The Classic of Documents* says:
*"Fullness invites loss, humility invites benefit—
this is the Dao/Way of Heaven."*

It also says:
*"You alone do not boast,
so none under heaven can contest your ability.
You alone do not claim,
so none under heaven can dispute your merit."*

The virtue/power of the superior acts without doing,
yet nothing is left undone.
Silently nurturing the primal transformation,
it is contained within the heart.
Things follow their natural course,
without need of self-assertion,
yet its brilliance is manifest in all.
This is the one who does nothing yet achieves all.

The virtue/power of the inferior acts with doing,
yet nothing is truly accomplished.
Because it does not lose its virtue/power,
its actions become burdensome.
Thus, the Dao/Way grows distant,
and wisdom is obscured.

The benevolence of the superior acts yet leaves nothing undone.
The righteousness of the superior acts yet has something left undone.

Benevolence means cherishing life and abhorring killing—
its application extends to all things,
thus it is said to act yet leave nothing undone.
Not boasting nor presuming over things,
its traces are unseen by all,
thus it is said to act yet leave nothing undone.

Righteousness means judging, taking, or giving as appropriate—
its application to things is said to act yet leave something undone.

The superior ritual acts yet finds no response,
so it forces compliance with repeated insistence.
*Reng* means "repeated," "frequent."

Ritual governs people,
making them submit to its order.
What aligns with ritual is right,
what does not is wrong.
Right and wrong must be contested,
and if it does not conform to external teaching,
only coercion can enforce it,
thus it is said to force compliance with repeated insistence.

Repetition leads to inconsistency,
frequency leads to carelessness—
to compel them to follow ritual,
one loses the natural Dao/Way.

Thus, one loses the Dao/Way and then virtue/power,
loses virtue/power and then benevolence,
loses benevolence and then righteousness,
loses righteousness and then ritual.

Ritual is the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,
yet it is the beginning of chaos.

When the Dao/Way is complete,
virtue/power, benevolence, righteousness, and ritual can all be embraced as one.
Now, having lost the Dao/Way,
things are distinguished by category,
and virtue/power appears alone, with doing and use—
unnatural, contrary to the Way.
Thus, when virtue/power is lost, it seeks support in righteousness,
when benevolence is lost, it seeks support in righteousness,
when righteousness is lost, it seeks support in ritual.
As distinctions grow ever more refined,
loyalty and trust thin out,
though one may wish to reunite them,
it is impossible.
Thus, ritual is said to be the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,
the beginning of chaos.

Presumptuous knowledge is the ornament of the Dao/Way,
yet it marks the start of foolishness.

Presumptuous knowledge refers to prior understanding of things.
Knowing their ultimate goodness and acting accordingly,
like the flower of a grass or tree—
this is the Dao/Way’s ornament displayed outwardly.
Ignorant of their ultimate evil yet acting accordingly,
it cannot be concealed,
thus it is said to mark the start of foolishness.

Therefore, the true man of Dao/Way abides in its depth,
not in its shallowness,
dwells in its substance,
not in its ornament.
The depth is free from blemishes in the Dao/Way.
The shallowness is the virtue/power of the inferior,
benevolence, righteousness, and ritual.
The substance is the inner application—
the Dao/Way of harmony and balance.
The ornament is the outer application—
the constant practices of life.

Without doing, in purity and stillness—
why borrow from its ornament?
Thus, one abides in depth and substance.

Therefore, abandon that and take this.
*That* refers to inferior virtue/power, benevolence, righteousness, and ritual.
*This* refers to the great Dao/Way, the virtue/power of the superior.
By reason, its abandonment and adoption
can surely not be confused.

Chapter 39: Those who once attained the One:
Heaven attained the One and became clear,
Earth attained the One and became tranquil,
The spirit attained the One and became responsive,
The grain attained the One and became abundant,
All things attained the One and came to life,
Kings and lords attained the One and ruled the world aright.

Their attainment of the One:
The One is the mysterious application of the great Dao/Way.
*Attainment* means reaching its mysterious application.

Heaven without clarity would fear fragmentation,
Earth without tranquility would fear upheaval,
The spirit without responsiveness would fear stagnation,
The grain without abundance would fear exhaustion,
All things without life would fear annihilation,
Kings and lords without noble elevation would fear ruin.

Fragmentation means incompleteness,
upheaval means unrest,
stagnation means short-lived,
exhaustion means prone to collapse,
annihilation means no continuation,
ruin means instability—
all are consequences of losing the Dao/Way.

Thus, nobility rests on humility as its foundation,
elevation rests on lowliness as its base.
Things follow their natural course—
this is their inherent pattern.

Therefore, kings and lords call themselves lone and childless,
not storing grain—
is this not their way of resting on humility as foundation?
Indeed, it is.

They employ the Dao/Way of humility toward the lowly.
Calling themselves lone and childless, not storing grain—
this is the utmost in humility.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
*"The Dao/Way of Heaven diminishes fullness and benefits humility,
The Dao/Way of Earth transforms fullness into flowing humility,
Ghosts and spirits harm fullness and bless humility,
Human nature abhors fullness and loves humility."*

Humility shines bright,
lowliness is unblemished—
this is the end of the true man of Dao/Way.
To say *non* is not to say *non*—
this is not to be taken as negation.

Thus, the wagon was first devised from the cart.
Initially, it was made as a wheel,
but wheels could not carry loads,
so it was adapted from the cart.
The clever use of things gave rise to knowledge.

Later, it was made into a wagon,
to carry things with it.
When things arrived, the wagon was left behind—
though many wagons were used, none boasted of their purpose.
Yet the wagon was without a wagon.

The merit of kings and lords,
those who aid all things, is very great.
Calling themselves lone and childless, not storing grain—
how is this different from the wagon being without a wagon?

They do not wish to gleam like jade,
nor to stand out like stone.
*Gleam like jade* refers to jade’s beautiful appearance,
*stand out like stone* refers to stone’s noble form.
Though outwardly beautiful,
within they lack adaptability to aid it,
thus they do not wish to appear like jade or stone.

Chapter 40: Contrariness is the movement of the Dao/Way,
Things reaching their extreme naturally reverse—
yet the Dao/Way does not follow things to their extreme,
thus it is known as the Dao/Way’s movement.

Weakness is the application of the Dao/Way.
In its practice, the Dao/Way does not contend with things,
knowing to embrace the feminine while guarding the masculine,
thus it is known as the Dao/Way’s application.»

The myriad things under heaven are born of *Having*,
*Having* is born of *Having-not*.
When they are born, they are *Having*;
when they do not generate, they are *Having-not*.
Benefit and harm follow each other,
existence and nonexistence succeed one another—
only the *reversing* and the *weak* align with *Having-not* in their principles.

**Chapter 42**
The Dao/Way gives birth to *Oneness*,
*Oneness* gives birth to the Two,
The Two gives birth to the Three,
The Three gives birth to the myriad things.
The myriad things carry *yīn* and embrace *yáng*,
and the *harmonizing* of *qi* produces their *virtue/power*.

The *Noble Ones* hear the Dao/Way,
and diligently practice it—
for their faith and understanding reach their fullest extent.
The *Middle Ones* hear the Dao/Way,
and sometimes it seems they retain it, sometimes they lose it—
for their faith is not deep, and their understanding has not yet arrived.
The *Lowly Ones* hear the Dao/Way,
and laugh at it; if they do not laugh, it is not worthy to be called the Dao/Way.
Not believing, not understanding—
such is the natural course of things.

When speaking of *Oneness*,
it is *Having*—
for it has something to rely upon.
To clarify the Dao/Way is like obscuring it,
to advance the Dao/Way is like retreating,
to level the Dao/Way is like making it uneven,
to uphold *virtue/power* is like lacking it,
the greatest brightness is like a stain,
the broadest *virtue/power* is like insufficiency,
established *virtue/power* is like stealing,
pure simplicity is like flowing away,
the greatest square has no corners,
the greatest vessel is fashioned last,
the greatest sound has no tone,
the greatest form has no shape—
the Dao/Way is hidden and nameless.

Its outward traces are shallow and simple,
its inner essence profound and subtle.
Knowing the subtle, guarding the minute—
thus it cannot be measured.
Only the Dao/Way is good at lending and completing.
Lending, it borrows from things without exhaustion;
completing, it fulfills its perfection without failure.

The One is the beginning of the uncarved block.

The One generates the Two—
the body of Heaven.
The Two generates the Three—
the form of Earth.
The Three generates the myriad things.

Once Heaven and Earth are distinguished,
the myriad things come into being.
With the proliferation of desires and emotions,
one can no longer hold fast to the One.

The myriad things bear yin upon their backs and embrace yang within,
their harmonizing *qi* in balance.
Yin and yang—
the wondrous operations of the Dao/Way.

To bear is to be external,
to embrace is to be internal,
to harmonize their *qi* in use—
thus their balance is never lost.

What people abhor—
the solitary, the orphaned, the destitute—
are the titles of kings and nobles.
This is the ultimate of harmonizing *qi*.

Thus, some things are diminished yet gain,
and others are augmented yet lose.
Where the Dao/Way resides,
it cannot be measured or reckoned.
The cycles of depletion and replenishment,
of emptiness and fullness,
endlessly succeed one another.

The teachings of humanity
are also my teachings of *virtue/power*.
Speaking of teaching, it has a beginning,
a rising point—
teaching the harmonization of *qi*.

*Yi*—what is fitting.
*Wo*—where the Dao/Way resides.
Humanity follows its teachings,
also by my adapting to the fittingness of things to teach.

The overbearing and violent
do not meet their natural end.
The overbearing do not conform to nature,
they do not embody the wondrous harmonization of *qi*.
Not meeting their natural end,
they can no longer preserve their vital essence.

I shall take this as the foundation of teaching.

All who are called "Father" and "Mother"
are but metaphors for the origin of life.
Taking this as the foundation of teaching
is to root it in the very beginning of instruction.

**Chapter 43**
The utmost softness in the world
overcomes the utmost hardness.
The Dao/Way is subtle and void—
how could it not be called soft?
It does not contend with things,
yet when used, it moves;
when gathered, it hides—
how could it not be called hard?
Without entering the unbroken,
without form—
this is the wondrous Dao/Way.
Without question,
it penetrates all without obstruction.
When the wondrous Dao/Way acts,
it transforms without measure,
thus preserving the subtlest principles.

Therefore, I know the benefits of *wuwei* [non-action].
The benefits of *wuwei*
are awakened by those who grasp the Dao/Way—
not easily understood by the common multitude.
Silent teaching,
the benefits of *wuwei*—
few in the world attain them.
The *Yijing* says:
*"Heaven speaks not, yet the four seasons proceed,
and all things are born."*
Thus, few attain it.

**Chapter 44**
Which is more intimate—name or body?
Which is more abundant—body or wealth?
Which brings greater harm—gain or loss?
Name is the adornment of the Dao/Way,
wealth is its delusion,
gain is its burden,
the body is its foundation.
With the body, one may observe teaching and practice the Dao/Way.
Thus, name is not more intimate than the body,
wealth not more abundant,
gain not more secure than loss.
Therefore, excessive love leads to great expenditure,
hoarding leads to great loss.
Those who fear losing their love
must dissipate their vital essence.
Those who fear losing their hoard
must always feel deficient.
Thus, there is regret over great expenditure,
and anxiety over great loss.

Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace,
knowing when to stop brings no peril—
thus one may endure long.
Knowing sufficiency means not loving excessively.
Knowing when to stop means not hoarding.
In harmony with the Dao/Way and teaching,
even if one does not wish to endure long,
how could it be otherwise?

**Chapter 45**
Great fullness seems deficient,
yet its use is inexhaustible.
Great excess seems empty,
yet its use is boundless.
To seem deficient and empty
is not to be self-satisfied or false.
Thus, it is neither exhausted nor boundless.

The most straight seems bent,
the most skillful seems clumsy,
the most eloquent seems tongue-tied.
Bent, it is not straight;
clumsy, it is not skillful;
tongue-tied, it is not eloquent.
Straightness has its time to shine,
skill its time to act,
eloquence its time to be employed.
The sage, profound in the Dao’s subtlety,
conceals its use and awaits the moment—
thus can it be so.

Cold is overcome by vigor,
heat by stillness—
this is the natural order.
Clarity and tranquility are the standard for the world.
Clarity and tranquility
are the result of *wuwei*.
If I practice *wuwei*,
the people will naturally align.
Thus, clarity and tranquility
can be the standard for the world.

**Chapter 46**
When the world is in the Dao/Way,
warhorses are turned to plowing fields.
When the world is without the Dao/Way,
warhorses breed in the suburbs.
Those in the Dao/Way use clarity and tranquility,
their hearts free from contention—
thus, warhorses are turned to plowing.
When the world is at peace,
all cherish life,
so fields are manured,
soil enriched,
and borders made fertile—
self-sufficient in food, their bellies full.
Without the Dao/Way, desires and greed arise,
placing them in lands of contention.
The greater resort to arms to vie for victory—
thus, warhorses breed in the suburbs,
for they do not gather in battle.
No greater crime than indulging desire,
no greater calamity than not knowing sufficiency,
no greater fault than coveting gain.
Desire is for those who hold name as intimate,
not knowing sufficiency is for those who hold wealth as abundant,
coveting gain is for those who see loss as harm.
Thus, true sufficiency is always sufficient.
Those who know sufficiency
have one and do not covet two,
have little and do not covet more—
though the external world is chaotic,
their inner clarity is serene.
One and little are already burdens—
how much more so insufficiency?
Thus, those who know sufficiency are always sufficient.

**Chapter 47**
Without leaving one’s door,
one knows the world;
without looking out the window,
one sees the Dao/Way.
The sage takes unity as the standard for the world,
thus, without relying on doors or windows,
what is known and seen is even more distant.
The farther one goes,
the less one knows.
The senses have their limits—
thus, it is said, the less one knows.
Therefore, the sage acts without going,
knows without seeing,
accomplishes without doing.
The vast Dao/Way
knows the movement and stillness of action,
discerns the truth and falsity of names,
judges the greatness and smallness of achievement—
thus, it does not wait for self-action to know,
self-perception to name,
self-effort to accomplish.

**Chapter 48**
Studying brings daily increase,
practicing the Dao/Way brings daily decrease.
Learners progress gradually,
from little to much—
thus, it is said, there is increase.
When the Dao/Way is complete,
its use is hidden,
its clarity concealed—
thus, it is said, daily decrease.
Decrease again, decrease,
until reaching *wuwei*.
In *wuwei*, nothing remains undone.
Empty, pure, and tranquil—
seen, it is not seen;
heard, it is not heard—
thus, there is no fear of decrease.
Decreasing to *wuwei*
is the subtlest of the Dao/Way.
In *wuwei*, nothing remains undone—
as if nothing were lost in the decreasing.

**Chapter 49**
The sage has no fixed heart,
taking the hearts of the people as their own.
Adapting to things, governing with measure,
teaching according to circumstances—
thus, no fixed heart.
The good, I treat as good;
the unvirtuous, I also treat as good—
*virtue/power* is goodness.
The trustworthy, I trust;
the untrustworthy, I also trust—
*virtue/power* is trustworthiness.
Speech is uniform, without favor or aversion.
Goodness and trustworthiness of *virtue/power*
make the world regard them as good and trustworthy.
The sage, amidst the world’s chatter,
blends the hearts of the people.
*Wǒngwǒng*—[restless and fearful].
The *Yijing* says:
*"All day long, diligent and earnest,
at night, vigilant as if in peril—
no blame."*
Taking the hearts of the people as one’s own,
one does not reveal one’s own capacities.
Blending, one outwardly aligns with the people
while inwardly differing.
All the people focus their ears and eyes—
their faith, obedience, reverence, and admiration reach their peak.

「百姓日用而不知，故注耳目而未知心之渊默矣。」
The people use it daily yet remain unaware—
thus, though all ears and eyes are fixed upon it,
they still fail to grasp the profound stillness of the heart.

「圣人皆孩之。」
The sage treats them all as infants.

「言百姓随教顺治，未有所能，如孩童之就乳不难率也。」
For the people follow instruction and submit to governance,
yet possess no innate capacity—
like infants naturally drawn to milk,
without effort or resistance.

「五十章 出生入死，万物出则生，入则死，自然之道。」
**Chapter Fifty:**
Life emerges, death returns—
all things born must rise, decay must fall,
the Dao of nature.

「生之徒十有三，死之徒十有三，言其类异而事不异也。」
Of those who live, thirteen are but one kind;
of those who die, thirteen another—
though their natures differ,
their affairs remain the same.

「人之生，动之死地十有三。」
Among living beings, thirteen are ever thrust
into the brink of death.

「言不出於生死之徒也。」
This is to say they never stray
from life’s and death’s domain.

「夫何故？」
Why is this so?

「以其生生之厚。」
Because their attachment to life is profound.

「物性本不生不死，专用死以为死，是故以生为生，随生而死，随死而生，是厚於生也，故曰生生之厚。」
By nature, things neither live nor die—
yet death is invoked to make them die.
Thus, they cling to life as life,
and in life find death,
while in death find life again—
this is the depth of their attachment to living,
hence the saying: *profound attachment to life*.

「盖闻善摄生者，陆行不遇兕虎，入军不被甲兵。」
Truly, those who master life’s preservation
walk the earth unharmed by rhinoceros or tiger,
enter battle untouched by steel or blade.

「兕无所投其角，虎无所措其爪，兵无所容其刃。」
The rhinoceros finds no foothold to strike,
the tiger no leverage for its claws,
the soldiers no opening for their blades.

「不生不死，内明常存，外境之来，於我何有。」
Neither born nor dying,
they inwardly retain their luminous clarity,
while external circumstances—
to them, what matter?

「故兕虎甲兵无所能及矣。」
Thus, rhinoceros, tiger, steel, and blade
cannot reach them.

「夫何故？」
Why is this so?

「以其无死地。」
Because they dwell beyond death’s grasp.

「以其不生，故无死地。」
For they do not cling to life,
and so death cannot claim them.

「玄机妙理，悟者知之。」
The subtle mechanisms and profound principles—
only the awakened understand them.

**Chapter Fifty-One:**
「道生之，大道也，始於道也。」
The Dao gives birth to it—
this is the Great Dao,
originating from the Dao.

「德畜之，上德也，善於容物，故归於德。」
*Virtue/Power* nurtures it—
this is the Supreme *Virtue/Power*,
skilled in accommodating all things,
thus returning to *virtue/power*.

「物形之，能生而在地各自成形。」
Things take shape from it—
each born entity, in its place,
forms its own distinct shape.

「势成之。顺於生畜，赋分类聚。」
Momentum completes it—
in harmony with life’s nurturing,
it grants portions and gathers into kinds.

「是以万物莫不尊道而贵德。」
Hence, all things reverently honor the Dao
and hold *virtue/power* in esteem.

「由道而生，仰德之育，故有尊贵之常。」
From the Dao they arise,
relying on *virtue/power*’s nourishment—
thus, their honor and reverence endure.

「道之尊，德之贵，夫莫之爵而常自然。」
The Dao’s honor, *virtue/power*’s nobility—
no titles bestow them,
yet they arise naturally.

「天下之所尊贵者，官爵而已。」
All the world esteems and honors
only titles and rank.

「道德无形，人莫能爵之，是不可以洛之义也，如是则出於自然。」
The Dao and *virtue/power* are formless—
no one can confer titles upon them,
thus they cannot be limited by human decree,
and so they spring from nature.

「故道生之畜之，长之育之，成之熟之，养之覆之。」
Thus, the Dao gives birth to it,
*nurtures* it,
*lengthens* and *nourishes* it,
*completes* and *matures* it,
*rears* and *shelters* it.

「皆自然之常理也。」
All are the enduring principles of nature.

「生而不有，为而不侍，长而不宰，不自有其功之至也。」
It gives birth yet does not possess,
acts yet does not lord over,
lengthens yet does not control—
its perfection lies in not claiming its own deeds.

「是谓玄德。」
This is called the *Mysterious Virtue/Power*.

「不可以测度故也。」

Because it cannot be measured or gauged.

**Chapter Fifty-Two:**
「天下有始，以为天下母。」
The world has its origin—
this is the Mother of all things.

「始於道也。」
Its origin lies in the Dao.

「道生一，一生二，二生三，三生万物，故曰为天下母也。」
The Dao gives birth to *Oneness*,
*Oneness* to *Duality*,
*Duality* to *Triplicity*,
and *Triplicity* to all things—
thus it is called the Mother of all things.

「既得其母，以知其子；既知其子，复守其母，没身不殆。」
Having obtained its Mother,
one comes to know its offspring;
having known its offspring,
one returns to guard its Mother—
thus, throughout one’s life,
no peril shall befall.

「万物本道而生，得其母之义也。」
All things arise from the Dao—
this is the meaning of obtaining their Mother.

「见万物已生之众，是知其子之义也。」
To see all things in their myriad born forms—
this is the meaning of knowing their offspring.

「万物有穷尽之时，而人道无休息之理，是复守其母之义也。」
All things have their end,
yet the Dao of humanity knows no cessation—
this is the meaning of returning to guard its Mother.

「如是则没身，岂有危殆以相及乎。」
Thus, through one’s entire life,
how could danger or peril reach them?

「塞其兑，闭其门，终身不勤。」
Block its *Joyous* aspect,
shut its gates—
thus, throughout one’s life,
no labor shall be known.

「塞其兑者，欲心不兴於内也。」
To block its *Joyous* aspect—
this means the heart of desire does not stir within.

「闭其门者，常邪自施於外也。」
To shut its gates—
this means perpetual perversity is warded off from without.

「动，劳也。」
*Dòng*—[exertion/labor].

「不劳苦而可保淳和之道。」
Without toil or suffering,
one may preserve the Dao of purity and harmony.

「开其兑，济其事，终身不救。」
Unblock its *Joyous* aspect,
aid its undertakings—
thus, throughout one’s life,
no deliverance shall be found.

「开其兑者，道不全也。」
To unblock its *Joyous* aspect—
this means the Dao is incomplete.

「济其事者，施为不穷也。」
To aid its undertakings—
this means deeds know no end.

「不可救者，入患难而不复安强矣，故曰不救。」
That which cannot be delivered—
once plunged into calamity,
it never returns to safety or strength,
hence the saying: *no deliverance*.

「见小曰明，常人忽於小而重於大。」
To see the small is called *clarity*—
ordinary folk neglect the small
yet fixate on the great.

「干云之木起於葱青，千里之涂始於足下，此见小之义也。」
The tree that pierces the clouds
begins with tender shoots;
the path of a thousand *lǐ*
commences beneath one’s feet—
this is the meaning of seeing the small.

「预识先知，非明而何。」
To foresee and know beforehand—
what else is *clarity*?

「守柔曰强。揉曲木者不累日，销金者不累月，此柔弱胜刚强之义也。」
To guard softness is called *strength*—
bending crooked wood requires no days,
melting gold no months—
this is the meaning of softness overcoming hardness.

「用其光，复归其明。」
Employ its *radiance*,
then return to its *clarity*.

「光者，照於外者也。明者，内自照者也。」
*Radiance*—that which shines outwardly.
*Clarity*—that which inwardly illuminates itself.

「用其光则知其子是也，归其明则复其母是也。」
To employ its *radiance* is to know its offspring;
to return to its *clarity* is to guard its Mother.

**Chapter Fifty-Three:**
「使我斗然有知，行於大道，介，大也。」
Let me boldly know the Great Dao—
*jiè*—[great/majestic].

「大有知则知其道之要妙，故能行於大道。」
Bold knowledge reveals the Dao’s essential subtleties,
thus one may walk the Great Dao.

「唯施是畏。」
Only *action* is to be feared.

「畏其乱得失，迷善恶，以施及於万物也。」
For *action* may disrupt gain and loss,
confuse good and evil,
and extend its influence to all things.

「大道甚夷，举道之要以明非道。」
The Great Dao is most plain—
by raising the Dao’s essentials,
one clarifies what is not the Dao.

「民甚好径。不任自然，务敏於得，故好径捷之迹形焉。」
The people love shortcuts—
they do not submit to nature,
yet strive eagerly for gain,
thus they favor swift, artificial paths.

「朝甚除，除其荒秽以尚严整也。」
Morning is marked by *cleansing*—
removing chaos and filth
to uphold order and precision.

「田甚芜，禾稼盛之，义，如芜生焉，非荒芜之芜也。」
Fields appear overgrown—
yet crops flourish within—
*wú*—[overgrowth], yet not barrenness,
but the vitality of growth.

「仓甚虚。上下足食，无拾克聚敛之事，非空虚之虚也。」
Granaries seem empty—
yet all, from high to low, have enough to eat,
with no need for hoarding or accumulation—
*empty*, yet not void,
but sufficiency’s embrace.

「服文彩，文事之饰也。」
Attire is adorned with patterns—
the embellishment of artificial pursuits.

「带利剑，武事之备也。」
Wearing sharp blades—
preparedness for martial pursuits.

「厌饮食，无饥馑也。」
Disdaining food—
yet no hunger or famine exists.

「财货有余。」
Wealth overflows—
abundance in goods.

「是谓盗夸，非道也哉。」
This is called *robber’s boast*—
how far from the Dao!

「务於好径，至於财货有余，不任自然者多矣。」
In their zeal for shortcuts,
reaching even to wealth’s excess,
many refuse nature’s way.

「失道之甚如盗者之相夸，不足贵也，故曰非道也哉。」
To stray so far from the Dao
as to boast like robbers—
unworthy of honor,
thus it is said: *how far from the Dao!*

「五十四章 善建者不拔，谨其始也。」
**Chapter 54:**
Those who build well are unshaken—
for they are careful in their foundation.

「善抱者不脱，保其成也。」
Those who embrace well do not slip—
for they safeguard what is complete.

「子孙祭祀不报。」
Descendants’ sacrifices are unceasing—
the ultimate in unshaken and unslipped.

「修之身，其德乃真；德，上德也。」
Cultivate it in the self—
its virtue becomes *true*—
*true* virtue, the highest virtue.

「真则不妄，信於下也。」
*True* means no falsehood—
trustworthy even to the lowly.

「修之家，其德乃余；修之乡，其德乃长；修之国，其德乃丰；修之天下，其德乃普。」
Cultivate it in the household—
its virtue overflows;
cultivate it in the village—
its virtue extends;
cultivate it in the state—
its virtue abounds;
cultivate it in the world—
its virtue is universal.

「以其全真，故有余以及於家。」
Because its *truth* is complete,
abundance reaches even the household.

「以其有余，故能长以及其乡。」
Because it overflows,
it can extend to the village.

「以其可长，故为丰厚以及於国。」
Because it can extend,
it becomes rich and full,
reaching even the state.

「以其遂丰，故普遍行於天下。」
Because it achieves abundance,
it spreads universally across the world—
this is the clear proof of *unshaken foundations*.

Thus, observe the self through the self,
the household through the household,
the village through the village,
the state through the state,
the world through the world.
See the Dao of governing the self—
then one knows how to govern one’s own self.
See the Dao of governing the household—
then one knows how to govern one’s own household.
See the Dao of governing the village—
then one knows how to govern one’s own village.
See the Dao of governing the state—
then one knows how to govern one’s own state.
See the Dao of governing the world—
then one knows how to govern one’s own world.
The unshaken and unslipped is thus revealed.

**How do I know this of the world?**
By this.
This is the way to observe the self,
the household, the village,
the state, and the world.

---

**Chapter 55:**
「含德之厚，比於赤子。」
The depth of virtue held
is likened to an *赤子*—[innocent infant].

「上德之人也。」
The person of *highest virtue*.

「赤子，婴儿之巽名也。」
*赤子*—[innocent infant], a *humble* name for a babe.

「毒虫不螫，猛兽不据，攫乌不搏。」
No venomous insects sting,
no fierce beasts seize,
no raptors clutch.

「无恐畏之心，不伤於物，至诚所在，物亦知之，故不加害。」
No fear or dread in heart—
unharmed by things.
Where *sincerity* resides supreme,
even things recognize it,
thus no harm is done.

「骨弱筋柔而握固，未知牝牡之合而作，精之至也。」
Though bones are frail and sinews soft,
yet its grip is firm—
it knows not yet the union of male and female,
yet moves with vigor—
the *essence* at its peak.

「终日号而不嘎，和之至。」
All day it cries yet never tires—
*smoothness* at its peak.

「握固则无所欲得而自执也。」
Firm in grip—
it seeks nothing to gain,
yet holds itself steady.

「作则不因币为而自动也。」
Vigorously moving—
it does not rely on external incentives,
yet acts on its own.

「号而不嘎，其本固也，非精与和之至而何哉？」
To cry yet never tire—
its foundation is unyielding.
How else but by the peak of *essence* and *smoothness*?

「知和曰常，知此和之至，可以常行而不离。」
To know *smoothness* is to know *constancy*—
to know this *smoothness* at its peak,
one can act in *constancy* without deviation.

「知常曰明，知此常之义，复归其明不难也。」
To know *constancy* is to know *illumination*—
to know the meaning of this *constancy*,
returning to *illumination* is no challenge.

「益生曰祥，保此常，守此明，日益日生至於盛大，无凶咎也。」
To grow beneficially is *auspicious*—
preserve this *constancy*,
guard this *illumination*,
and daily growth will flourish to greatness—
no ill fortune or blame shall come.

「心使气曰强。」
The heart directing *qi* is called *strength*.

「不求外助，内保久长，气与道俱，不强何待。」
No reliance on external aid—
internal safeguarding of longevity,
*qi* and Dao in harmony—
what need for *strength*?

「物壮则老，是谓不道，不道早已。」
Things grow strong, then age—
this is called *not the Dao*,
and *not the Dao* brings early decline.

「物有成形，老必及之，不知变道，非道之用。」
Things, once formed, must age—
to fail to know the Dao of *transformation*,
this is *not the Dao’s* application.

「已，止也。」
*已*—[cessation], the end.

「止而至於败，微妙何容焉。」
To reach ruin through *cessation*—
how can the *subtle* endure this?

---

**Chapter 56:**
「知者不言，默运元机，物随以化，家至户晓，事有穷时，故不在於言。」
The *wise* do not speak—
they silently work the *primordial mechanism*,
and things transform in response.
Even to the household’s door,
when matters reach their limit,
words are not needed.

「言者不知。」
Those who speak are not *wise*.

「入乎耳，出乎口，口耳之问数寸尔，何足以美七尺之躯哉？」
Words enter the ear,
exit the mouth—
a gap of mere inches,
how can they adorn a seven-foot frame?

Thus, words are not the essence of *wisdom*.

「塞其兑，内藏其明。」
Block its *joyousness*—[兑, *ui*],
and *illumination* is kept within.

「闭其门，外杜其邪。」
Close its gates—
and external *evil* is barred outside.

「挫其锐，知进退。」
Dull its sharpness—
and one knows advance and retreat.

「解其纷，顺而不乱。」
Unravel its confusion—
and it flows smoothly, undisturbed.

「和其光，不自显。」
Smooth its brilliance—
and it does not reveal itself.

「同其尘，不自异。」
Blend with the dust—
and it does not set itself apart.

「是谓玄同。」
This is called *mysterious uniformity*.

*Mysterious* means *subtle and refined*,
*uniform* means *harmonious and one*.

Thus, it cannot be grasped as *near* or *distant*,
cannot be taken as *beneficial* or *harmful*,
cannot be claimed as *noble* or *base*.
*Near* and *distant*, *beneficial* and *harmful*,
*noble* and *base*—
these are what people weigh,
the distinctions they make.

Where the Great Dao resides,
it has no *name*—[非常名, *unconventional name*],
its form is unseen,
its sound unheard—
how much less can it be grasped as *near* or *distant*,
*beneficial* or *harmful*,
*noble* or *base*?

Thus, it is *noble* for all under heaven.
*Noble*—[贵], to honor its Dao,
for none beneath heaven can equal it.

---
「以政治国，以奇用兵，以无事取天下。」
By *government* one governs the state,
by *strategy* one wages war,
by *non-action* one takes the world.

「政，正也。」
*Government*—[政], *rectitude*.

「奇，不正也。」
*Strategy*—[奇], *not rectitude*.

Just as the straight is the edge of the square,
yet the crooked is not discarded.

War values *deception*—[诡祚],
like defending the east while striking the west—
*rectitude* cannot be practiced.

*Rectitude* and *strategy* both exist,
yet their use is formless—
like *non-action* in taking the world.

If there is *action*,
then love becomes partial—
partial love,
and all will not join.

If all will not join,
how much less will the world?

**How do I know this is so?**
By this.
Thus, *non-action* is the supreme subtlety.

The world abounds in taboos,
yet the people grow ever poorer.

Men multiply sharp tools,
yet the state grows ever more confused.

Men multiply clever arts,
yet strange things proliferate.

Laws and decrees grow ever more explicit,
yet thieves and robbers multiply.

This too is the natural order.

Too many taboos,
and the harmony of taking and giving is lost.

Too many sharp tools,
and power shifts to the people below.

Too many clever arts,
and the heart’s turbulence is born.

Too many laws and decrees,
and the rise of reckless fortune cannot be halted.

Thus the Sage says:
*I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;
I take no action, yet the people grow rich—
self-sufficiency within.*

*I love stillness, yet the people align themselves;
they do not greedily covet,
and naturally return to few desires.*

*I desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity.
When desire does not arise,
they preserve their true nature and return to the plain—
the beginning of returning to the Dao,
hence it is called *simplicity*.

**Chapter Fifty-Eight**
When governance is murky,
the people are pure.
Murky—like having no ability.
Pure—like having no knowledge.

The Dao is originally *non-action*,
thus it is valued as such.

When governance is scrutinizing,
the people are deficient.
Scrutinizing—it cannot contain anything.
Deficient—it cannot complete anything.

This is the loss of the Dao’s subtlety,
thus it results in this.

Calamity—where fortune leans,
fortune—where calamity lurks.
Who knows their limits?

Joy to its extreme becomes sorrow,
adversity to its extreme becomes prosperity—
not in a single day.

Though this principle is clear,
men do not seek it out.
They forcefully invite calamity,
forcefully pray for fortune—
this is called not knowing their limits.

Is there no *rectitude*?
Things have never failed to exist within the *rectitude* of the Dao.

*Rectitude* becomes *strategy*,
*goodness* becomes *monstrous*.
*Complex*—to reverse and return.

Lost and not returning,
you consult your tortoise shell—
you will surely meet disaster.
How much less so with *strategy* and *monstrous* things?

The people’s delusion has long endured.
They are deceived beyond measure,
yet do not know to cease.

Is thus the Sage:
Square yet not sharp,
Honest yet not rigid,
Upright yet not domineering,
Bright yet not blinding.

Inner sufficiency aligns with the Dao,
Harmonious without ostentatious adornment,
Lest its pristine virtue be defiled by external pretense.

**Chapter 59:**
To govern men and serve Heaven,
Nothing surpasses *frugality*.
*"Frugality"* here means love while concealing.

The Sage practices *frugality* in the Dao,
The petty man in wealth.
**Frugality** alone is called *early service*—
Through its capacity to conceal,
It may be termed *supreme virtue*.
Thus men vie to embrace it,
Yet fear its consequences.

*Early service* is *accumulating virtue*.
Not boasting of one’s abilities,
Virtue then flourishes anew—
Hence *accumulating virtue* is said.

*Accumulate virtue* and nothing fails,
Nothing fails and none know its bounds—
None know its bounds,
And thus a realm may be secured.

Inner harmony and sufficiency,
Naturally require no external aid—
Thus nothing fails.
What is conquered leaves no remnant,
No margin of excess or deficiency—
Thus none know its bounds.

Applied to governance,
When aligned with the Dao,
All things return—
Thus a realm may be secured.

The origin of securing a realm,
Lies in enduring longevity.
*Origin* refers to the first principle of growth.
To practice *frugality* and accumulate virtue,
Is the foundation of ruling a state—
If not thus preserved for long,
Such a case has never been.

This is the *Dao* of probing roots and securing foundations,
Of enduring life and perpetual vision.

*Roots and foundations* symbolize the inseparable pair.
*Enduring life* is not the aim of *tranquility* and *non-action*.

**Chapter 60:**
To govern a great state,
As if cooking a small fish.

*Cooking* has its method,
Small and great—what difference?
Perceive the principle, grasp the moment,
Governance becomes effortless.

When the Dao is applied to the world,
Its spirits are not *divine*—
Each finds its proper place,
Names persist but functions are subtle,
No reckless bestowal of calamity or fortune—
This is called *not divine*.

Not that its spirits are not *divine*,
But that the *divine* does not harm the people.
There is no opening for harm,
Hence the people follow the Dao’s transformation,
Speaking without censure,
Acting without restraint—
All because the Sage governs with the Dao,
Spirits and gods cease where humanity ends,
Thus they have no need to exert their *divinity*.

Two forces do not harm each other—
Thus virtue returns in harmony.
The *Dao* of resonance and response,
Even wood and stone obey—
How much more so spirits and gods?

With *divinity* guarding its essence,
I preserve its virtue—
Together they fulfill the Dao,
This is called *harmony*.

**Chapter 61:**
Great states embrace the *lowly*,
The *crossroads* of the world.

*The lowly*—gentle and accommodating,
Not fixated on rigidity,
Its currents flow without obstruction or exhaustion.
*Crossroads*—those who gather and attach themselves.

The *crossroads* of the world are *feminine*—
A metaphor for gentleness.
*The feminine* always triumphs through stillness,
Thus mastering gentleness.

*The masculine* finds stillness as lowly.
Those who employ the *masculine* often regard stillness as lowly—
If stillness is lowly,
Then the *crossroads* of the world will come.

Thus great states yield to small states,
And small states yield to great states—
Both triumph through stillness.

It is said that small states do not govern,
Great states take them to govern,
And great states do not govern,
Small states take them to govern—
Not bound by great or small,
Only the Dao is revered,
Not for private gain of people or lands.

Thus sometimes yielding to take,
Sometimes yielding while taken—
Their return is one principle,
The natural Dao,
Which does not exceed the lowly.

Great states do not seek to absorb small states,
Small states do not seek to serve great states.
*Absorb*—to nurture people with propriety.
*Serve*—to attend to others with respect.
To attend to others is to place oneself lowly.

Both find their proper place,
Thus the great should embrace the lowly.

Great states rely on strength,
Few can yield to the lowly.
Now it is said the great should embrace the lowly,
To reveal that which the great finds difficult to practice.

**Chapter 62:**
The Dao—
The hidden essence of all things,
*Hidden*—deep and profound—
Not shallow or near.
Not named, no trace remains,
Not of the ordinary kind.

The treasure of the virtuous man,
Hidden like a man’s most guarded wealth.
The treasure of the unvirtuous man,
Obtained brings life,
Lost brings death—
Thus it is obtained in safety.

Fine words may be sold,
Many hear and follow them.

「*Revere*—to elevate others with respect.
Others revere what is done,
Thus it is never spurned.

What is not virtuous in others—how can it be discarded?
Discarding others, the Dao cannot be practiced,
The Dao cannot be practiced, teaching cannot flourish,
Thus it must not be discarded.

Therefore, establish the Son of Heaven,
Appoint the Three Excellencies,
Speaking of the utmost use of teaching.

Though one may have a jade tablet to precede four horses,
It is not as good as sitting and advancing this Dao.

A jade tablet and four horses,
Though they are the highest of gifts,
Once used, they are exhausted.

The implements of ritual,
Things lack adaptability.

The Three Excellencies seated to discuss the Dao,
The original transformation is boundless,
To govern the people,
All receive blessings,
Thus jade tablets and horses cannot be compared to the Dao.

Why the ancients valued this Dao,
Was it not because it was not sought daily and obtained?
Or because it could absolve guilt and avert evil?

Therefore, it is most valued by the world.
Practice it, and it is perfect;
Thus it is not sought daily.

It aligns with principle and propriety,
Thus it is not a matter of guilt.

The Dao is as such,
Therefore the world values it most.

**Chapter 63:**
To act with non-action,
To manage without managing,
To savor without savoring.

To act with non-action—then what is done does not hinder.
To manage without managing—then matters are not repeatedly burdened.
To savor without savoring—then its flavor is not diminished.

Those who know its essence,
Can conclude it in a single word;
Those who do not know its essence,
Will endlessly ramble.

Great and small, much and little,
Repaying grievances with virtue.

Great and small, much and little—
In summary, encompassing what is not uniform.

Repaying grievances with virtue—
Gentle, harmonious, clear, and tranquil,
Without harboring malevolence,
The wondrous application of the Dao.

Seek difficulty in what is easy,
Achieve greatness in what is minute.

The world’s difficult matters must be done in ease,
The world’s great matters must be done in the minute.

Thus the sage never does what is great,
And so can achieve what is great.

What is easy is the foundation of difficulty,
What is minute is the root of greatness,
Thus difficulty and ease follow one another,
Greatness and smallness succeed one another,
Like a cycle without end.

The sage knows this truth,
Believes in its principle,
Thus he preserves what is small and guards what is low.

Light promises bring few trusts,
Many easinesses bring many difficulties.

This is also the natural order.

It is said first, "Seek difficulty in what is easy,"
Difficult matters are done in ease,
Lest people treat ease lightly.

Thus it is said, "Light promises bring few trusts,
Many easinesses bring many difficulties,"
To reveal that matters progress gradually.

Therefore, the sage avoids what is difficult,
And so forever has no difficulties.

Knowing the Dao of difficulty,
He treats the end as carefully as the beginning,
Difficulties cannot obstruct its wondrous application,
Thus he forever has no difficulties.

**Chapter 64:**
Its stability is easy to uphold,
Its unmanifested state is easy to plan.

Act before there is danger or trace.
Its fragility is easy to break,
Its subtlety is easy to disperse.

Govern before there is chaos.

"Act before there is manifestation,
Govern before there is chaos.
Little force yields great results."

A tree of arms’ embrace,
Grows from a hair’s tip;
A nine-tiered terrace,
Rises from piled earth;
A journey of a thousand miles,
Begins beneath one’s feet.

Speaking of the gradual growth from subtle beginnings to completion.

The doer brings ruin,
The grasper loses it.

Exerting utmost force to act,
The utmost force will bring ruin;
Exerting utmost force to grasp,
Excessive grasping will cause loss.

Thus the sage acts with non-action,
And so never meets ruin;
He grasps without attachment,
And so never loses.

Illustrating the higher meaning.

When the people engage in affairs,
They often fail when near completion.

The foolish demand to finish matters,
The wise observe what has not yet sprouted.

Building a mountain nine *ren* high,
Its labor fails at one *zan* short—
Common shallow perception,
Thus success and failure are as such.

Treating the end as carefully as the beginning,
Then there is no failing matter.

Preserving fullness and guarding completion,
Can ensure lasting duration,
Thus there is no failing matter.

Therefore, the sage desires what is undesired,
Does not prize difficult-to-obtain treasures;
Difficult-to-obtain treasures are what the great desire.

Desiring what is undesired,
Then one reaches the utmost of desirelessness.

Learning what is not learned,
The Dao is spread through virtue,
And there is nothing left to learn.

Returning to what others have erred,
*Return*—to reverse.

To reverse what others have erred,
Is not to share in their errors.

To aid all things in their natural course,
Without daring to act.

To aid all things in their natural course,
Is not to rely solely on one’s own strength.

Not daring to act,
Thus he displays the Dao of aiding without acting.

**Chapter 65:**
The ancients who excelled in practicing the Dao,
Did not do so to enlighten the people,
But to bewilder them.

The bewildered have no knowledge,
The enlightened have much knowledge.

Knowledge and wisdom vie with one another,
They stray from virtue and violate the Dao,
Not fitting for those who excel in practicing the Dao.

The people are difficult to govern,
Because their knowledge is too much.

Already difficult to govern,
They further use their knowledge and wisdom,
How much more so if enlightened to aid their chaos?

Therefore, governing with knowledge is a state’s ruin;
Not governing with knowledge is a state’s blessing.

Using knowledge causes one to lose their natural course,
Thus it is likened to ruin.

To govern things with principle,
To aid with adaptability,
What calamity could there be?

Knowing these two things is also a standard model.
It cannot be neglected,
The same for ancient and modern,
Taking the standard model as a parable.

Always knowing the standard model,
This is called *Mysterious Virtue*.

*Mysterious Virtue* is profound and distant,
It opposes things,
Only then does it reach the utmost harmony.

Though called a standard model,
It has no visible form,
Thus it is said, *Mysterious Virtue* is profound and distant.

Things pursue profit,
And cunning deceits arise.
The Dao is natural,
Thus it opposes things.

Opposing those who stray from the Dao,
This is the utmost harmony,
There is none who does not conform,
Thus it is called *great harmony*.

**Chapter 66:**
The rivers and seas become kings of the valleys,
Because they excel in descending.

A metaphor.

Rivers and seas are lowly,
Great and capacious,
All streams flow to them,
Thus they are above all valleys.

Therefore, the sage wishes to be above others,
By his words descending;
Wishes to lead others,
By his person following behind.

The lonely, the widowed, the childless,
Are those who descend with their words.

**Chapter 67:**

To eat coarse food yet honor the spirits with filial piety,
To wear rough garments yet adorn the ceremonial cap,
To dwell in humble abodes yet labor diligently at irrigation—
This is to serve with one’s own body.

Thus, though placed above, none hold him in contempt;
Though placed before, none dare to harm him.
His virtue and Dao are profound and distant,
Beyond measure or injury.
He has no intention of self-exaltation when above,
And when before others, he makes room for those behind—
Thus, weight and harm are far removed.

Therefore, the world delights in promoting him without tiring.
Because he does not contend, none can contend with him.
His joy in promotion without tiring
arises from the absence of weight and harm.
Even calamity and injury cannot reach him—
how much less competition and rivalry?

All under Heaven say my Dao is vast,
yet I seem unworthy.
*Xiào* means "to resemble"—
to resemble those who came before.
The common view of the multitude
is that I govern with force,
saying I do not resemble those who acted visibly
to rule the world.

Only because it is vast does it seem unworthy.
If it resembled others for long,
it would be trifling indeed.
The Great Dao is unfathomable;
the multitude cannot know or see it,
thus it seems unworthy.
My Dao resembles those who ruled by Dao,
thus it is said: "If it resembled others for long."
Its principles are subtle, its words profound—
thus it is called "trifling."

I possess three treasures;
I guard and uphold them—
never to be parted from for a moment.
The first is *cì*—

---

To pity those under Heaven who have lost the Dao.
The second is *jian*—
the utmost of frugality.

The third is not daring to act first for all under Heaven—
like the rivers and seas in their goodness of yielding.

For *cì* brings courage;
*jian* brings abundance;
not daring to act first for all under Heaven
brings completion of one’s vessel and length of days.

The application of the Dao,
the working of its principles—
now to abandon *cì* and its courage,
to abandon *jian* and its abundance,
to abandon humility and act first—
this is death.

To rely alone on force and strength,
to act recklessly and bring chaos—
all will reject you,
and death may be awaited at once.

For *cì*—
in war, it brings victory;
in defense, it brings security.
To speak of *cì* as the Dao
is to say its application knows no limits.

When Heaven intends to save,
it shields with *cì*.
This aligns with Heaven’s virtue—
for Heaven’s Dao also holds *cì* as supreme.

**Chapter 68:**
The virtuous warrior does not rely on force,
but acts with yielding gentleness.
The skilled fighter does not rage,
but triumphs through benevolence and righteousness.
The master of victory does not contend—
contention brings insufficiency,
so victory lies in not contending.

The adept at using people places themselves beneath them.
By praising virtues and humbling oneself,
people will surely turn to you.

This is called the virtue of non-contention,
the strength of using people,
the harmony with Heaven’s ancient measure—
the utmost attainment of the Dao.

With non-contention’s virtue within oneself,
and the people’s strength devoted to you,
Heaven follows the Dao in its course,
and the sage follows Heaven in governance.

*Ji*—the extreme—
is the central way,
the great central Dao.

**Chapter 69:**
In wielding arms, there is a saying:
*"I dare not be the aggressor but only the defender,
I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot."*

Weapons are instruments of calamity;
the sage uses them only when unavoidable,
thus does not act as aggressor but as defender—
speaking that misfortune does not arise from oneself.

Not daring to advance an inch—
this is to avoid reckless action.
Not daring to retreat a foot—
this is to be resolute in repelling chaos.

This is called *xíng wú xíng*—
action without action,
action that does not originate from oneself.

To seize without arms,
to prevail without strength,
to hold without weapons—
all are of the kind of *xíng wú xíng*.

No disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy—
not daring to advance an inch,
not daring to retreat a foot—
how could this be underestimating the enemy?

To underestimate the enemy risks losing one’s treasures.
This is an analogy—
for *cì* is the treasure.

Thus, when armies clash,
victory may be won in a single morning.
To fight without anger,
with benevolence and righteousness following—
this is surely how victory is taken.

The Han High Emperor, clad in mourning at the military gate,
could honor the Emperor Yi with profound pity.

**Chapter 70:**
My words are very easy to know,
very easy to practice.

The world cannot know it, cannot practice it.
Humans may exalt the Dao, but the Dao does not exalt humans.
Easy to know yet not known,
easy to practice yet not practiced—
thus they are deceived by it.

Words have their root,
affairs have their master.
Root and master—
strong names indeed,
yet their essence lies in knowing their core.

Only the ignorant fail to know me.
Because they are ignorant,
they fail to grasp my subtlety.
Few know me,
so those who do are precious.
Though few know me,
if there are those who know and take me as their model,
this is what makes them precious.

Thus the Sage wears coarse cloth while cherishing jade—
an analogy.
Wearing coarse cloth does not flaunt his beauty,
but conceals his outward appearance.
Cherishing jade preserves his inner truth,
thus safeguarding his inner realm.

**Chapter 72:**
Knowing the unknown is supreme.
To know the subtlety of knowing—
though humble and insufficient,
it is still better than not knowing.
Not knowing what is known is a flaw.
To feign knowledge when truly ignorant,
to force interpretations,
to stray from naturalness—
this is the flaw.

Yuan Xian said:
*"To study the Dao yet fail to practice it—
this is the flaw."*

Only by recognizing the flaw
does one avoid it.
To know that not knowing is a flaw,
and to seek true knowing to dispel ignorance—
thus, no flaw remains,
and one is free from it.

The Sage is free from flaw,
for knowing the essence of knowing,
one is free from flaw.
Because one recognizes the flaw,
one is free from it.
This is also why teaching others
to remove their ignorance
leads to their freedom from flaw.

---

The people do not fear coercive power,
yet great power arrives.
This is not the power of ordinary rulers—
those who rely on reputation, color, punishment, and law.
The Dao values only knowing.
Without knowing, morals collapse,
and violence and theft arise—
thus great power lies within.

Do not narrow your dwelling,
for if you narrow your comfort,
the Dao will not expand.
Do not exhaust your life’s purpose.
The more life manifests the Dao,
the more it should not be exhausted.
Only by not exhausting it
does one not exhaust it.
Because one does not exhaust the Dao,
one does not exhaust life’s purpose.
Joy resides within—
how could there be exhaustion?

Thus the Sage knows himself without displaying himself,
loves himself without valuing himself.
He focuses within while overlooking the external.
Hence, he discards that and embraces this—
discarding self-display and self-aggrandizement,
embracing the Dao of inexhaustibility.

**Chapter 73:**
Boldness in daring leads to death,
boldness in not daring leads to life.
Knowing these two,
one may gain or suffer harm.
What does Heaven abhor?
Who knows its reason?

Boldness in daring is harm,
boldness in not daring is benefit—
both lose the subtle harmony of *kūn*.
What Heaven abhors is what opposes the Dao.
Who knows its reason?
It is confusion over daring and not daring,
not understanding its true nature.

Thus the Sage finds it difficult.
He cannot boldly dare or not dare.
The Way of Heaven:
without contention, yet victorious,
without speech, yet responsive,
without summoning, yet they come,
effortless yet masterful in planning.
Heaven follows the Dao,
thus it is so.

Heaven’s net is vast,
sparse yet nothing slips through.
The net symbolizes encompassing all things.
*Huánghuáng*—
its vastness.
Greatness makes precision difficult,
yet its response to things is like an echo—
no loss can be spoken of.

---

The people do not fear death,
yet they seek danger as their daily pursuit,
knowing how to advance but not retreat,
pushing one another into calamity—
how could this be fear of death?

Seeing death before them,
they rush toward it—
thus they do not fear it.
If one made people constantly fear death,
and then acted strangely,
I could seize and kill them—
who would dare?

Fear of death and dread of killing
would make the wicked few,
while indifference to death and contempt for killing
leaves the wicked unchanged—
what benefit is there for teaching and transformation?

*Qí*—evil.
Now, because they do not fear death,
they dare not take killing upon themselves.
Let those who hold authority kill.
When crimes are manifest,
let the authorities execute them—
this is sufficient to deter and encourage.

To usurp the authority to kill
is like a substitute carpenter wielding the adze—
an analogy.
The master carpenter has his lines and sharp tools,
yet does not carve recklessly,
thus able to shape things into vessels.
For a substitute to wield the adze—
few escape injury to their hands.
Injured hands mean losing the method.
To usurp the authority to kill
is like a substitute carpenter—
it will fail and cause harm.

---

The people’s hunger
comes from their rulers’ excessive taxation.
They do not know that giving is taking,
yet plunder is rampant,
food is insufficient—
thus they hunger.

The people are hard to govern
because their rulers act excessively.
Laws and edicts multiply,
thieves and bandits abound.
The more rulers act,
the more the people rise in exhaustion,
hoping to escape punishment,
their deceits multiplying—
thus they are hard to govern.

People’s indifference to death
comes from their excessive pursuit of life.
They are lost in pleasure,
forgetting their sorrows—
this is human nature.
Only those who do not cling to life
are wiser than those who value it.
Not clinging to life—
this is the subtlety of the Dao.
Following nature effortlessly,
not forcing things,
thus wiser than those who value life,
for they have attained the Way.

**Chapter 76:**
The people are soft and weak in life,
firm and strong in death.
Their nature is still, forgetting passions,
simple and unadorned—
thus they may preserve longevity.
As desires grow,
they no longer fear death—
hence, *"soft and weak in life, firm and strong in death."*

All things, grasses and trees,
are soft and brittle in life,
dry and withered in death.
In life, like young onions—
touch them, and they break.
Greedy for life, striving to grow,
their strength exhausted,
they must meet their end—
this too has its nature,
like that of humans.
Thus, *"soft and brittle in life, dry and withered in death."*

Thus, those who are firm and strong are the servants of death,
while those who are soft and weak are the servants of life.
When desires grow strong,
they must contend with others;
when their form is robust,
they are bound to be exploited by others.
The soft and weak—
no one competes with them,
no craftsman takes them—
hence, the distinction between life and death.

Therefore, the strong in arms do not conquer,
the strong in wood perish.
When arms are pushed to their utmost,
they reveal inevitable defeat—
hence, *"do not conquer."*
When wood is pushed to its utmost,
it reveals withering and decay—
hence, *"perish."*
They perish together in their decay,
all by nature’s logic.

The strong and great are lowly,
the soft and weak are exalted.
The strong and great have no room to spare—
pushed to their limit, they easily falter.
The Way of the lowly preserves endurance.
The soft and weak have room to spare—
not yet reaching their limit,
all give unto them.
The benefit of the lowly—
all things follow this.

**Chapter 77:**
Is the Dao of Heaven like the drawing of a bow?
The high are pressed down,
the low are lifted up,
the overabundant are diminished,
the insufficient are supplied.
This is the bow’s tension—
unrelenting yet never exhausted.
The Dao of Heaven diminishes the overabundant
and supplements the insufficient,
balancing all things in due measure—
thus it is so.

But the Dao of humankind is not so:
they diminish the insufficient to serve the overabundant.
They speak of insatiable greed,
yet overlook the harmony of perfect balance.

Who can serve the world with what they have in excess?
Only those who have attained the Dao.
The Dao’s use is vast and boundless,
benefiting all things without end—
thus, they always have excess to serve the world.

Hence, the Sage acts yet does not cling,
completes the task yet does not dwell—
this is the mystery of having excess.
They do not desire to be seen as virtuous.
If they cling to their deeds and dwell in their achievements,
then their virtue is revealed—
this is not the Dao of the Sage who has attained the Way.

**Chapter 78:**
In all things, none are weaker than water,
yet none can conquer the strong as water does—
there is nothing to replace it.
Water’s virtue benefits all things:
it enters filth and flows downward—
how else but through softness?

Those who attack the strong rely on force and defy nature,
thus they cannot conquer water’s softness.
There is nothing to replace it—
its logic is natural, unalterable.
Hence, softness overcomes hardness,
weakness overcomes strength—
all know this, yet none can practice it.
Water is seen by all,
not a difficult thing to know.
Yet none can practice it—
this shows the Dao is unclear,
and those who revere the Dao are not steadfast.

Thus, the Sage says:
*"To bear the land’s impurities—
this is to be its sovereign.
To bear the land’s misfortunes—
this is to rule the world."*
They speak of enduring filth and accepting impurities without end,
for then the Dao is practiced and virtue grows greater—
this is what the world bestows upon them.
Straight words seem like their reverse.
They appear contrary to what is straight.
To bear impurities is to be the sovereign of the land,
to bear misfortunes is to rule the world—
in speech, it seems not the truth,
yet in principle, it is most true.

**Chapter 79:**
To reconcile great grudges,
there will always be lingering grudges.
Having grudges is better than having none,
yet reconciling them requires strength—
thus grudges breed grudges,
and lingering grudges arise.

How can one do good?
This is not the good of goodness.

The Sage holds the left contract and does not demand accountability from others.
The left contract is what the common people cannot see—
it is also the meaning of embracing *yang*.

When the left contract is applied, people will inevitably follow it,
so there is no need to demand accountability from others before the Dao is fulfilled.

Thus, those with virtue hold the contract,
while those without virtue hold the tally.
The left contract is what the highest virtue holds—
when highest virtue exists, it aligns with the Dao;
without highest virtue, there is no alignment—
hence it is called *tally*.

The Dao of Heaven has no favorites,
it always sides with those who are good in their practice of the Way.

**Chapter 80:**

In small states with few people,
let there be tens and hundreds of implements,
yet they are not used.
*Le* means few—
few people means few needs,
no competing desires,
and one may resemble the subtlety of the Dao,
preserving wholeness, returning to simplicity.
The tens and hundreds of implements are not entirely unused—
they are simply not contended for.

Let the people value death and not move far away.
Each person suffices to preserve the intent of life,
so they cherish death.
With few desires and little seeking,
they need not travel far to pursue gain.

Though there are boats and carriages,
they have no use for them;
though there are armor and weapons,
they have no need to display them.

「Let the people return to knotting cords to record their needs.
With few desires and easy contentment, they share without contention,
so boats and carriages may remain idle,
and armor and weapons may be laid aside.
The governance of knotted cords—
a practice of the ancient age when people were pure—
now revived, proves the verification of preserving wholeness and returning to simplicity.

Let them find sweetness in their food,
beauty in their attire,
comfort in their dwellings,
and joy in their customs.
This is the ease of self-sufficiency.

Neighboring states lie in sight,
the sounds of roosters and dogs heard between them—
speaking of their untamed yet orderly ways.
When people reach old age and die,
they do not visit one another.
Each does not covet what the other has,
for purity in its fullest form compels such conduct.

**Chapter 81:**
Faithful words are not ornate,
ornate words are not faithful.
Words are used to manifest teaching and convey principle—
why bind them to beauty or ugliness?
To adorn words with beauty
does not necessarily mean sincerity,
but gaining trust becomes difficult.

The virtuous do not argue,
those who argue are not virtuous.
The good act in accordance with the Way before them,
without relying on empty rhetoric.
When empty rhetoric flourishes,
how can it be the Way of the truly virtuous?

The wise do not boast of knowledge,
those who boast of knowledge are not wise.
Knowledge resides within the heart,
unspoken yet all-pervading;
to claim knowledge as vast
is not truly so—
it risks the suspicion of ignorance,
and such boasting arises from it.

The sage does not hoard.
Establishing teaching and manifesting principle,
they do not always align with others—
the Way is not something to be privately stored and accumulated.
The more one gives to others, the more one possesses,
the more one shares with others, the more one has.
With clear understanding and penetrating insight,
the Way is vast and virtue broad—
teaching others as one teaches oneself,
like the source of rivers and seas,
one need not fear lack or scarcity.

The Dao of Heaven benefits without harming;
the Dao of the sage acts without contention.
The Dao of Heaven and the sage’s Dao,
in their application, are one—
benefiting nature’s essence,
acting at the beginning of things,
without harm or contention,
thus fully realizing the subtle and profound use of the Way.
