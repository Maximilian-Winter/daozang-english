**Preface to the *Daode Zhengjing* with Annotated Text**
**Compiled by Peng Zhi of the Song, from the Blessed Forest (Hélín)**

How great is the divergence in transmission of texts, yet how varied are the interpretations!

Even *The Annals of Lu*, when compared between He Yan’s version and the stone inscriptions of Cai Yong, already differ—what then of the rest?

As for my annotations on Laozi’s phonetic readings, I have gathered the interpretations of Li and Lin to supplement what Lu Deming left incomplete. For the main text itself, I have relied solely on the *Zhenghe Imperial Edition*, while also recording the discrepancies among other commentaries within the same volume, compiling them into one work to append at the end.

Though Laozi takes *qingxū-wúwéi* (emptiness and stillness) as his foundation, his teachings diverge from those of the Confucian scholars, and thus he does not concern himself with the minutiae of single words or readings. Yet how can one grasp the meaning of his words without first understanding them, and how can one suddenly awaken to the Dao without careful examination? Let the reader weigh these matters carefully.

Respectfully inscribed by Peng Zhi of the Blessed Forest.

「The Chapter of the Sovereigns and Kings Obtaining the One as the Foundation of the World (侯王得一以为天下贞)
*Chéng* (程) omits **以** (以); in other manuscripts, **贞** (贞) is often written as **正** (zhèng), likely to avoid taboo of the temple name. 

**This is the way of their attainment (其致之一也)**
*Sū* (苏), *Shū* (书), and *Chén* (陈) manuscripts all omit the last two characters (二字).

**The Sovereigns and Kings, without non-action, yet hold high rank—this is cause for dread and contraction (侯王无以为贞而贵高将恐蹙)**
The five commentaries omit **无为** (wúwéi); *Zhuǎnwēi* (纂微), *Sīmǎ* (司马), *Sū* (苏), *Cáo* (曹), and *Chén* (陈) manuscripts all omit **无以为贞而** (wúwéiyǐzhēngér); *Chéng* (程) has **天下** (tiānxià) above **贞** (zhēng) and omits **而贵高** (érguìgāo) three characters; *Lù* (陆) renders **蹙** (cù) as **蹶** (jué), with the sound *jiǎn* (蹇月) and *yùe* (其月), according to *Guǎngyùn* (广韵), meaning to stumble or falter, also written as **蹶** (jué).

**Therefore, high rank must be rooted in lowliness, and elevation must be based on descent (故贵以贱为本高以下为基)**
*Sīmǎ* (司马) and later manuscripts add **必** (bì) before **故** (gù).

**To call oneself "lonely and solitary, without grain" (自称孤寡不谷)**
*Zhuǎnwēi* (纂微), *Sīmǎ* (司马), *Sū* (苏), *Cáo* (曹), and *Chén* (陈) manuscripts all render **称** (chēng) as **谓** (wèi).

**Is this not the perversion of lowliness as the foundation? (此其以贱为本邪非乎)**
*Chéng* (程) places **非** (fēi) above **邪** (xié) and omits the last two characters (二字).

**Countless praises without praise (数誉无誉)**

**琭琭 (Lǐnglǐng)**
*Lù* (陆) pronounces it as *lù* (禄); *Zhuǎnwēi* (纂微) states that it was anciently written as **录录** (lùlù), like the sound of *玉* (jade).

**落落 (Luòluò)**
*Lù* (陆) renders it as **珞** (luò), pronounced *luò* (洛) or *lì* (历); *Zhuǎnwēi* (纂微) states that it was anciently written as **落落** (luòluò), like the sound of *石* (stone).

**The Chapter of the Dao’s Motion Through Reversal (反者道之动)**

**Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Man Hears the Dao**

Thus, establishing one aspect: *Zhuǎnwēi* (纂微), *Sū* (苏), *Cáo* (曹), *Chén* (陈), *Yè* (叶), and *Chéng* (程) manuscripts omit the **故** (gù).

**Dài (贷):**
*Lǐ* (李) reads it as *tuō* (吐代切).

**Chapter Forty-Two: The Dao Generates**
*Héshàng* (河上) renders the title as **Dao Transforms** (dàohuà).

Yet princes and nobles take it as **praise**:
*Qīngyuán* (清源) adds **自** (zì) below.

Thus, things may be diminished yet increased:
*Sū* (苏) omits **故** (gù).
Increased yet diminished:
*Sū* (苏) adds **或** (hú) above.

**Yìqiúzhī (亦其义教之):**
*Sīmǎ* (司马) omits **义** (yì).
*Shào* (邵) renders it as **"I also teach its meaning"** (wǒ yì yào zhī).

**Qiáng (强):**

**Chapter Forty-Three: The Dao’s Utmost Softness**
*Héshàng* (河上) renders the title as **Universal Application** (piānyòng).

Galloping across the Dao’s utmost firmness:

*Yè* (叶) omits **骋** (chěng).
*Dázhēn* (达真) renders **坚** (jiān) as **刚** (gāng).

None can enter its **unbroken** state:
*Lǐ* (李) renders **间** (jiàn) in departing tone—speaking of the Dao’s seamless unity, with no gaps.

Thus, one knows the benefit of **wuwei**:
*Zhuǎnwēi* (纂微), *Sīmǎ* (司马), *Sū* (苏), *Cáo* (曹), *Chén* (陈) manuscripts add **吾** (wú) above and omit **也** (yě) below.
*Yè* (叶) retains only **无也** (wú yě).

**Xījízhīyǐ (希及之矣):**
*Zhuǎnwēi* (纂微), *Sīmǎ* (司马), *Sū* (苏), *Cáo* (曹), *Chén* (陈), *Yè* (叶), and *Qīngyuán* (清源) omit **矣** (yǐ).

---
**Chapter Forty-Four: Name and Self**

I once saw such a dung cart in Jiangxi, and only then did I understand this.

Thus, it is known that *足* (zú) means "sufficient":
The *Sīmǎ* (司马) version omits **之** (zhī) and **足** (zú).

**Chapter Forty-Seven: Not Leaving the Doorstep**
*Héshàng* (河上) renders the title as **Discerning the Distant** (jiànyuǎn).

One version reads **惵惵** (xù xù), *Héshàng* (河上) reads **惔** (chù), and *Jiǎn Wén* (简文) reads **怵** (chù). The *Sīmǎ* (司马) version adds **焉** (yān) beneath. **歙歙** (shè shè) has no meaning, **惵惵** (xù xù) also lacks coherence; in my humble view, **惵惵** (xù xù) should be interpreted as a form of **危惧** (wēijù, fearful and cautious), likely a corrupted character.

**浑心** (hún xīn): *Lù* (陆) reads **浑** (hún) as *hū* (胡本切). The *Zhuǎnwēi* (纂微), *Sīmǎ* (司马), *Sū* (苏), *Cáo* (曹), *Dázhēn* (达真), *Chén* (陈), *Yè* (叶), *Qīngyuán* (清源), *Huáng* (黄) versions all read **浑其心** (hún qí xīn).

*The sage’s non-illness*: *Lǐ* (李) reads as *fǎ xìng* (法性), originally empty, as his ability to "illness" the world’s forced knowledge is to "illness" illness itself—dual nature and function both vanish, medicine and illness are forgotten together.
