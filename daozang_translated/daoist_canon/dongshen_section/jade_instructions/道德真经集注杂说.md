**Volume One of the *Zhuji Zasuo* of the *Daode Zhengjing***
*Compiled by Peng Zhi of the Song-era Hèlín*

When the Taizu Emperor marched to conquer Taiyuan, he halted at Zhènyáng and heard that the Daoist Su Chengyīn had secluded himself since the Five Dynasties period, though repeatedly summoned, he never came. The Emperor then received him in the imperial pavilion.

At eighty years old, Su Chengyīn replied to the Emperor’s inquiry on nurturing life (*yǎngshēng*) by saying: *"My own practice of nurturing life is merely refining the mind and cultivating qi. For emperors, it is different."*

Laozi said:
*"If I do nothing, the people transform themselves.
If I desire nothing, the people return to simplicity.
Doing nothing, desiring nothing—
Concentrate the spirit in the Great Harmony."*

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor and King Tang of the Xia Dynasty ruled for long years—
They attained this Dao.

The Emperor was pleased with this response.

See also the *Dōngdū Shìlüè* in the *Yǐnyì* and *Gāodào* transmissions.

**Hongmengzi Zhang Wumeng**, styled Língyǐn, loved simplicity and emptiness, mastering the *Laozi* and *Yijing* deeply. He entered Huashan, forming a bond with Liu Haichán and Zhòng Fàng as outer-world friends, and served Master Chen Xīyí. Wumeng often grasped subtle truths.

Later, he entered Tiāntáishān. Emperor Zhenzong summoned him and asked for strategies for longevity. Wumeng replied:
*"I am a rustic mountain dweller. Each morning, I recite the *Laozi* and *Zhouyi*—nothing else."*

He was granted the title of *Zhuozuo Zuolang*, but he declined and returned to the mountains.
Though bestowed gold, silk, and the honorary title of *chushì*, he refused them all.

**From the *Gāodào Zhuan*:**

The **Bìxūzi** Chen Jingyuan, a disciple of Zhang Hongmeng, composed the *Zhuǎnwēi Piān* of the *Dàodé Jīng Cángshì*, gathering the refined insights of ancient commentaries and supplementing them with his master’s secret transmissions to form this work. During the **Xīníng** era, he was summoned and presented his writings to the emperor, who personally inscribed words of praise. He also authored a twenty-plus volume *Zhāngjù Yīnyì* on the *Nánhuá Jīng*, now also housed in the **Daozang**.

See also the *Bìxūzi Zhuan*, the *Zhuǎnwēi Piān·Xù*, and the *Daozang Mùlù*. In his *Cángshū Zhì*, **Guǎngchuān Dòng Dǒu** notes:

During the **Tang Xuānzong**’s reign, after he annotated the *Laozi*, he standardized the text as the *Dàodé Jīng*, categorizing passages on **Dao** in the upper scroll and those on **virtue** in the lower, then inscribed them on stone at the **Lǎozǐ Temple** in Wōkǒu. He further records that the Tang Daoist **Zhang Daoxiàng** compiled a seven-volume *Jízhù Dàodé Jīng*, encompassing thirty schools. Those whose names survive include: **Héshànggōng, Jiějiě, Yán Zhūn, Wáng Bì, Hé Yān, Guōxiàng, Zhōng Huì, Sūn Dēng, Yánggù, Jiūmóluóshì, Lú Jǐngyù, Liú Rénhuì, Gù Huān, Táohóngjǐng, Sōnglíng, Péi Chǔsī, Dú Bì, Zhāng Píng, Zhāng Sì, Zāng Xuānjìng, Mèng Ānqī, Mèng Zhìzhōu, Dòu Luè, Sòng Wénmíng, Chǔ Rǒu, Liú Jìnxǐ, Cài Zǐhuàng, Chéng Xuānyīng, Chē Huìbì**. Yet cross-referencing the *Xīn-Jiù Tángshū·Yìwén Zhì*, additional names emerge: **Wúqiū Wàngzhī, Xiāngyì (surname unknown), Chéng Shào, Wáng Shàng, Shǔ Cái, Yuàn Zhēn, Shì Huìyán, Huìlín, Yìyǐng, Liáng Kuàng, Shù Zhōngshān, Fù Yì, Yáng Shàngshàn, Lǐ Yǔnyuàn, Chén Sìgǔ, Rèn Zhēnzǐ, Fèng Guō, Xuān Jǐng Xiānsheng, Yáng Shàngqì, Hán Dù, Liáng Wǔdì, Liáng Jiǎnwéndì, Jiǎ Dàyǐn, Bìlǘ Rénxù, Liú Zhòngróng, Wáng Shù, Dài Yì, Xuānzōng, Lú Cángyòng, Xíng Nánhé, Fèng Cháoyǐn, Bái Lǚzhōng, Lǐ Bō, Yǐn Zhīzhāng, Lǚ Déming, Chén Tíngyù, Lǚ Xīshēng, Wú Shànjīng, Sūn Sīmiào, Lǐ Hán guāng**—forty schools in total. Yet of these, Zhang Daoxiàng’s compilation includes only **Guōxiàng, Liú Rénhuì, Sōnglíng, Péi Chǔsī, Dú Bì, Zhāng Sì, Zāng Xuānjìng, Dòu Luè, Sòng Wénmíng, Chǔ Rǒu, Liú Jìnxǐ, Cài Zǐhuàng, Chē Huìbì**—fourteen names absent from the *Zhì*. The *Zhì* further lists Daoxiàng’s *Jízhù* as four volumes, yet Dòng Dǒu’s collection contains seven, suggesting later additions.

In the **Song Chóngníng** era, the *Daozang* was reexamined, yet this work was no longer found within. Only the annotations of **Xuānzōng, Héshànggōng, Yán Zhūn, and Lǚ Xīshēng**—alongside Fù Yì’s transmitted ancient text of the *Dàodé Jīng*—remained. Externally, **Lǐ Yuē, Lǐ Róng, and Jiǎ Qīngyí** each offered their own commentaries, while **Wáng** and **Gù** compiled imperial annotations under Xuānzōng’s command. **Dú Guāngtíng** later authored the *Guǎngshèng Yì*, also preserved in the *Cángshì*. Thus, it is clear that even the six recorded in the *Zhì* were incomplete—lamentably, nine-tenths of these works survive only by name.

The Tang official **Lǚ Xīshēng**, of the **Bīngbù**, and son of **Lǚ Miǎn**, authored a four-volume *Dàodé Jīng Zhuàn*. His preface briefly states:

*"The Master Lao’s teachings take **Dao** as essence and **virtue** as function—non-action yet encompassing all action—harmonizing with the **Royal Polarity**. Yang Zhu followed the Master’s essence but erred in undervaluing the world, elevating self over substance. Zhuang Zhou expounded the Master’s function but overreached, seeking to abandon sageliness and discard wisdom. Shèn and Hán misapplied the Master’s **virtue**, descending into harsh legalism. Wáng and Hé lost the Master’s **Dao**, drifting into empty nihilism. These six disciples are all the Master’s transgressors. Thus, I have written this transmission to elucidate his true intent."*

He further states:

*"In antiquity, Fúxī drew the Eight Trigrams, mirroring all things, exhausting the principles of **nature and life**, aligning with the harmony of **Dao and virtue**. The Master Lao preceded heaven and earth, founding **yin and yang**, probing the limits of **nature and life**, uncovering the depths of **Dao and virtue**—thus sharing the same origin as Fúxī. King Wén observed the dynamic **Nine and Six** of the **Great Ease**, valuing strength yet prioritizing change, ultimately centering on moderation. The Master Lao discerned the **Seven and Eight** of the **Great Ease**, emphasizing softness and stillness, unifying all under the **Great**. Thus, he shared the same lineage as King Wén. Confucius inherited the **Dao** of Yáo and Shùn, establishing the constitutional models of Wén and Wǔ, guiding the people with the teachings of **ren and yì**. The Master Lao modeled himself on Fúxī, encompassing the achievements of **Huángdì**, transforming the world through the **Dao of virtue**. Thus, he aligned with Confucius in **strategic application**. These three sages represent the pinnacle of **sainthood**; the Master Lao harmonized and transcended them, penetrating the mechanisms of transformation, exploring the ultimate precision of essence—truly the most divine."*

The Tang official **Lǐ Yuē**, of the **Bīngbù**, and son of **Lǐ Miǎn**, authored a four-volume annotation on the *Dàodé Jīng*. His interpretation argues that the world mistakenly views this text as the empty rhetoric of immortals, unaware that the **Six Classics** are but branches of **Huáng-Lǎo doctrine**.

The Tang **Tàizōng** once asked **Fù Yì**, *"Buddhism and Dao are profound—why do you not grasp their principles?"* Fù Yì replied, *"Buddhism is but a bandit from the Western lands, initially confined to the frontier, now seeping into China. It is nothing more than a superficial embellishment of Lao and Zhuang’s mystical phrases—useless to the common folk and harmful to the state."* The emperor was persuaded by his words.

「At his deathbed, he admonished his son: *"The profound unity of Lao and Zhuang’s teachings, along with the doctrines of the Six Classics from Zhou and Confucius, constitute the **name-teaching** (míngjiào). You should study them diligently. As for the heretical barbarians (yāohú) corrupting China, all are misled by them—you must not follow their ways."* (As seen in his *Old Book of Tang* biography.)

The Tang **Xianzong** once addressed his ministers: *"Are the matters of immortals (shénxiān) truly credible?"*
**Lǐ Fān** replied: *"The discourse of immortals originates from the Daoist tradition. The Daoists revere the *Five Thousand Words* of Laozi as their foundation, and his core teachings align with those of the Classics. Later generations, however, who indulged in eccentric speculation, falsely attributed the idea of immortals to Laozi. Thus, the two rulers, **Qín Shǐhuáng** and **Hàn Wǔdì**, were deceived by such claims and ultimately gained nothing."*

The emperor was deeply convinced by his words. (As seen in the *Old Book of Tang—Xianzong’s Records*.)

**Zhòng Zhǎng**’s eldest son, **Zǐ Guāng**, styled **Bù Yào**, in the late years of **Kāihuáng**, built a hermitage along the riverbanks. When officials paid their respects, he declined by claiming muteness.

If someone requested his teachings, he would write the characters **Lǎo** and **Yì** (Lao and Zhuang) to show them, comparing **Wén Zhōngzǐ** (Master Mozi) to **Yú Zhòng** and **Yí Yì** (the virtuous but misunderstood figures of antiquity). (As recorded in **Wáng Jì’s** *Biography of Master Zhòng Zhǎng* and **Wén Zhōngzǐ’s** annotations.)

**Dōng Gāo Zǐ** **Wáng Jì**, styled **Wú Gōng**, elder brother of **Wáng Tōng**, was a great Confucian scholar of the late **Sui dynasty**. He owned fields along the riverbanks, and **Zhòng Zhǎng**’s son **Zǐ Guāng** built a dwelling near the northern bank. **Wáng Jì** admired his sincerity and moved to live nearby, always placing *Zhōu Yì* (the *Book of Changes*), *Lǎo Zǐ* (Laozi), and *Zhuāng Zǐ* (Zhuangzi) at his bedside, rarely reading other books. (As seen in the *New Book of Tang—Biographies of Recluses*.)

**Lú Hóngyī**, styled **Chéngrán**, hid in **Sōngshān** (Song Mountain). In **Kāiyuán** year six, he was summoned to **Dōngdū** (Eastern Capital). Upon meeting the emperor, he did not bow. The ministers sent a **Tōngshì Shèrén** (attendant official) to inquire about his conduct, and he reported: *"I have heard the **Old Master** (Lǎojūn) say that **rites** (lǐ) are but the outward display of **loyalty and sincerity** (zhōngxìn), insufficient to rely upon. As a humble subject of the mountain, I dare not present myself with such formalities."*

(As seen in the *Old Book of Tang—Biographies of Recluses*.)

**Zhēnyī Xiānsheng** **Sīmǎ Chéngzhēn**, with his courtesy name **Zǐ Wēi**, resided in his retreat on **Tiān’tái** (Tian Tai Mountain) and never ventured out. The **Ruìzōng** emperor ordered his brother **Sīmǎ Chéngtán** to persuade him to leave. Once he arrived, the emperor led him into the **inner palace** (zhōngyè) and questioned him about his methods. He answered: *"Pursuing the Dao requires daily **self-cultivation** (rǎn), diminishing one’s self further and further until reaching **non-action** (wúwéi).*

*Even the perceptions of the mind and eyes must be reduced, yet they cannot fully cease. How much more so when one delves into heterodox theories and amplifies one’s clever schemes!"*

The emperor said: *"Your words apply to cultivating oneself, but how would they guide the governance of a nation?"*

The Master replied: *"A nation is like the self—thus, one must cultivate a mind of simplicity, harmonize one’s qi with emptiness, and act spontaneously without selfishness, and the realm will be governed in harmony."* The Emperor sighed in admiration: *"This is the speech of Guangchéng!"*

During the **Kāiyuán** era, he was summoned again to the capital, and Emperor Xuanzong decreed that a hall be built for him on **Wàngwū Shān** (Wangwu Mountain) as his residence. Skilled in **seal and clerical script**, the Emperor commanded him to transcribe *Lǎozǐ* in the **Three Scripts** and correct its textual errors. *(As recorded in the *New Tang Book·Recluses*, the old text states: The Emperor ordered him to transcribe the *Lǎozǐ Jing* in the Three Scripts, thereby correcting the text and establishing its true version of **5,384 characters**, which he then presented to the throne.)*

**Zhēnyī** Master **Sīmǎ Chéngtán**, of **Rúzhōng** (Ruizhong), was a scholar who later entered **Sōngshān** (Songshan) as a Daoist. After some time, he traveled to **Tiāntái** (Tiantai). Emperor Xuanzong sent envoys to summon him, and upon his arrival, the Emperor questioned him on Daoist methods. He answered: *"The essence of the Dao is nowhere more refined than in the **Five Thousand Words** (of *Lǎozǐ*). The rest are merely verbose elaborations, wasting nothing but paper."*

*(The *Old Tang Book·Recluses* and its revised edition record: The Emperor once asked him about the Dao, and he replied: *"Those deeply versed in the Dao have nothing beyond Lǎozǐ’s **Five Thousand Characters**; the rest are mere squandering of paper."* When further questioned on **immortal techniques and alchemical refinement**, he responded: *"These are matters for rustics. Seeking them over years is not a concern for a ruler."* The text here differs slightly from the old edition, hence both are recorded.)*

**Bān Gù** recorded that **Lǎozǐ**’s **Línshì** lineage had a tradition, as did the **Fù**, **Xú**, and **Liú Xiàng** schools. The **Fù** school had **37 chapters**, the **Lín** school **4**, the **Xú** school **6**, and **Liú Xiàng** **4**. Alas, their texts have long been lost.

The *Lǎozǐ Dàodéjīng* transmitted today is sometimes combined into **two volumes** (upper and lower), or divided into **81 chapters**, or **72 chapters**. **Héshànggōng** partitioned it into **81 chapters**: the upper text follows **celestial patterns** (as heaven’s numbers are odd), hence **37 chapters**; the lower text follows **earthly patterns** (as earth’s numbers are even), hence **44 chapters**. **Yán Zhēn** instead arranged it by **eight yin principles** and **nine yang principles**, aligning them as **eight following nine**, resulting in **72 chapters**—**40 in the upper**, **32 in the lower**—completely diverging from Héshànggōng’s version. Since their foundations differ, their interpretations also vary, and none can be verified.

**Hán Huán Tán** remarked: *"In antiquity, Lǎozǐ composed **two chapters on emptiness and nothingness**; later admirers elevated them above the **Five Classics**. From the reigns of Emperor Wén and Jīng of the Hàn to **Sīmǎ Qiān**, all spoke of this."* *(As recorded in *Yáng Xiǔ’s Transmission*.)*

**Ruǎn Jié** wrote *Tōng Lǎo Lùn*, stating: *"The Dao follows spontaneity and transforms through it. If a sovereign upholds it, all things will transform naturally. The *Yì* calls it the **Tàijí**, the *Chūnqiū* calls it **yuán**, and Lǎozǐ calls it the **Dao**."* *(As recorded in the *Tàipíng Yùlǎn*.)*

**Wáng Bì** annotated the *Dàodéjīng*, doubting that the chapters *"佳兵"* (*"Fine Arms"*) and *"民之饥"* (*"The People’s Hunger"*) were authored by Lǎozǐ.

**Hé Yán**, while annotating *Lǎozǐ*, did not finish. Upon seeing **Wáng Bì’s** self-explanation of his annotations, Hé Yán, though impressed, could not continue and only nodded in assent. Thus, he abandoned the annotation and instead composed the *Dàodé Lùn*. Another account states that **Hé Píngzhū** completed his annotation of *Lǎozǐ* and presented it to **Wáng Fǔsì**. Seeing Wáng’s profound and ingenious work, Hé Yán exclaimed in awe: *"Such a man can truly discuss the interplay of **Heaven and humanity**!"* He then repurposed his own annotations into the *Dàodé* **Two Treatises**.

*The Record of Literary Styles* states: *"Confucian scholars argue that Lǎozǐ was not a sage, abandoning ritual and learning. **Píngzhū**’s interpretation aligns him with the sages, and his treatise spread widely."* *(As recorded in the *Shìshuó* and its annotations.)*

**Ruǎn Zhān**, son of **Ruǎn Jié**, met **Sītú Wáng Róng**, who asked: *"The sages value **ritual and instruction**; Lǎozǐ and Zhūangzǐ emphasize **spontaneity**. Do their meanings converge or diverge?"* Zhān replied: *"Perhaps they are the same."* Wáng Róng sighed deeply for a long while before inviting him, and the incident was later called the **"Three-Sentence Connection"** *(sānyǔyuán)*.

**Lù Yuánlǎng**, courtesy name **Dé Míng**, served as a **Tàixué** scholar-official. During the **sacrificial rites** under Emperor **Gāozǔ**, after **Xú Wényuǎn** lectured on the *Xiào Jīng* and **Biànshēn Huìchéng** on the *Bōrě Jīng*, **Dàoshi Liù Jìnxǐ** lectured on *Lǎozǐ*. Dé Míng challenged all three, each adhering to their doctrines and establishing their positions. The crowd was subdued. The Emperor rejoiced: *"Though the three are skilled in debate, Dé Míng’s single rebuttal silenced them all—truly an accomplished scholar!"* *(As recorded in the *New and Old Tang Books·Confucian Scholars*.)*

At the start of **Kāiyuán**, the Emperor ordered **Zhōngshū Lìng Zhāng Yuè** to recommend scholars proficient in the *Yì*, *Lǎozǐ*, and *Zhūangzǐ*. **Jìxián Zhíxuéshì Hóu Xíngguǒ** recommended **Kuàijī Kāng Zǐyuán** of **Kuàijī** and **Píngyáng Jìng Huìzhēn** to Zhāng Yuè, who submitted them. Both were granted **sìdú** (attendance in lectures) and soon also served as **Jìxián Shìjiàng Xuéshì** (lecturers at the Hall of Accumulated Worth). Initially, **Xíngguǒ**, **Huìzhēn**, and **Chánglè Fēng Zhāoyǐn** lectured together. Zhāoyǐn excelled in expounding the **hidden meanings of Lǎozǐ and Zhūangzǐ**, while Huìzhēn was also skilled in *Lǎozǐ*. Before each lecture, he would **purify himself with incense and water** before reading. *(As recorded in the *New Tang Book·Confucian Scholars*.)*

**Zhāng Xuānmíng**, in his youth, studied Confucianism in **Hénuò**. Later, he became a Daoist, mastering the teachings of **Lǎozǐ and Zhūangzǔ**. The **Jìn Gāozǔ** summoned him and asked whether Daoist methods could govern a nation. He replied: *"The Dao is the subtle principle of all things, expressed in words. Those who grasp its utmost can govern the realm even while seated at home."* The Emperor admired his words, invited him into the **inner palace**, and lectured with him on the *Dàodéjīng*. He was then appointed as his teacher and granted the title **Tōng Xuān Xiānsheng** (Master of Penetrating Mystery), though his later fate is unknown. *(As recorded in the *Wǔdài Shǐ·Yīxíng Transmission*.)*

Emperor **Tàizōng** heard that officials in the **Biànshuǐ** region were secretly selling state grain for private profit. He told his attendants: *"The imperial gate is like a rat’s hole—how can one block it entirely? Only by removing the most corrupt can it be managed."*

「The boatmen and ferrymen, if they engage in private trade, should only be prevented from harming public affairs—no need to investigate them further. As for the officials of **Suì** (Suì County), the key is that their supplies reach the granaries without excessive loss or damage.

**Lǚ Móngzhèng** remarked: *"Water too clear has no fish; people too scrutinizing have no followers. The deceit of lesser men—how could the virtuous not know it? If the ruler embraces broad tolerance, then all matters will be resolved harmoniously."* **Cáo Shēn** (Cáo Shēn) did not disturb the markets and prisons, for he accepted both good and evil in equal measure. If one presses too hard, the wicked and corrupt will find no refuge—so be cautious not to provoke them. The Emperor’s words were perfectly aligned with the **Dao of the Yellow Emperor and Lǎozǐ** (Yellow and Old).

*(As recorded in the *Guócháo Shìshì*.)*

**Liáo Zhāi** (Chen Zhongsu), known as **Chén Guàn**, once compiled twenty-plus chapters of writings titled *Zhāoyǔ* (Revealed Words). In its preface, he briefly stated: *"The **Yùqīng Zhāoyīng Palace** (Palace of Jade Purity’s Responsive Manifestation) sent the official **Wáng Zēng** to request the verification of Daoist scriptures from the **Sānguān** (Three Offices). The Emperor then spoke of how his works were not as refined and concise as Lǎozǐ’s Five Thousand Words. **Zhāng Zhībái** (Zhang Zhongbai) said: *"Your Majesty’s focus on this is the art of governance through non-action. I have studied the divine teachings of our ancestors, which state: The **Wén** and **Jìng** of the **Hàn**, and the **Tàizōng** of the **Táng**, are what Confucius called ‘those without whom I have no doubt.’ I have examined the deeds of these three rulers and found that the **Hàn Wén**’s methods were derived from Lǎozǐ, while his virtuous and filial policies resembled those of the **Hàn Wén**. Now I excerpt their teachings in ten-odd chapters, recorded hereafter."*

At the beginning of **Hàn Wén**’s reign, he first rewarded **Píng Bó** (Píng Bó) and later ennobled **Sòng Chāng** (Song Chang), prioritizing those who benefited the state over those who served his personal interests. This was the principle of *"putting others before oneself"*—thus, none could surpass him in the realm. As Lǎozǐ said: *"Put others before oneself, and one’s self will come first."*

Every morning, **Hàn Wén** would halt his carriage to receive petitions from the **Láng Cóng** (Láng Cóng) officials. Even if their words were not immediately useful, he would still praise them, and if they were useful, he would adopt them. He praised all suggestions, whether good or not—this was the principle of *"the virtuous accept all as virtuous, the non-virtuous they also accept as virtuous,"* and thus his **virtue/power** was universally benevolent.

When **Hàn Wén** first ascended the throne, he appointed a **shèifū** (treasurer) who argued endlessly without restraint, promoting him to the **Shànglín Lìng** (Superintendent of Shànglín). **Shì Zhī** (Shì Zhī) protested: *"**Zhōu Bó** (Zhou Bo) and **Zhāng Xiàngrú** (Zhang Xiangru), whom Your Majesty honors as ‘longzhe’ (noble elders), never spoke so boldly when offering counsel. Would you truly emulate this **shèifū** (treasurer) with his relentless chatter and quick wit, rather than men of true substance? Moreover, the **Qín** (Qin) dynasty entrusted authority to scribes and clerks, who competed in swiftness and severity of judgment. Their flaws were mere empty formalities without real benefit, and when their errors were not heard, the state declined into ruin. Now you elevate this **shèifū** (treasurer) for his mere eloquence, and I fear the world will follow this trend, valuing only glib tongues while neglecting true merit. The influence of the lower ranks upon the higher is swift as an echo—every appointment must be weighed carefully."* The Emperor agreed and did not promote the **shèifū** (treasurer). He understood that those skilled in debate were often not truly virtuous, but merely proficient in words.

Lǎozǐ said: *"The wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise."* He also said: *"The virtuous do not debate; those who debate are not virtuous."* And again: *"Much speech leads to exhaustion; better to hold to the center."*

The Emperor decreed: *"There is a **fěidàng** (slanderous) tree at court, established to allow officials to voice their concerns. Now the law punishes slander and false accusations—this silences the ministers and prevents the ruler from hearing faults. Let this punishment be abolished."* Thus, **Jiǎ Yì** (Jia Yi) could submit petitions even to the point of invoking ancestral temples and posthumous titles, and **Hàn Wén** would still accept and praise them. This was truly *"without taboos"*—and the people prospered as a result. As Lǎozǐ said: *"The more taboos a land has, the poorer it becomes."*

When **Hàn Wén** (Emperor Wén) honored **Yù Tǎ** (Yu Ta), whose ancestral tomb was in **Zhèndìng** (Zhèndìng), he appointed a guardian and commanded regular sacrifices. He summoned **Yù Tǎ**’s brothers, bestowed high offices and lavish gifts upon them to show favor, and **Yù Tǎ** then issued orders across the realm, instructing all to change their names in accordance with the decree and forbidding them to call themselves *"dì"* (Emperor). This was the principle of *"strengthening to weaken, giving to take"*—the choice lies with the ruler alone.

When the **Wú Wáng** (King of Wu) feigned illness to avoid attending court, the Emperor gave him a cane and chair, and **Zhāng Wǔ** (Zhang Wu) and others, having accepted bribes, further increased their rewards to shame him into compliance. This too was drawn from the same principle.

Lǎozǐ said: *"To gather, one must first disperse; to weaken, one must first strengthen. To abolish, one must first establish; to take away, one must first give."*

The **Emperor Wéndì** withdrew his anger upon seeing **Yuàn Àn** seat **Shèn Fūren**, turning his displeasure into joy, and lavished **Yuàn Àn** with rich rewards—truly one who conquers himself without boasting of it. This is how virtue shines and the realm grows strong.

Lǎozǐ said: *"Not boasting, thus it shines."* And again: *"The self-conquered expand."*

When the **Emperor Wéndì** accepted **Jiā Yù’s** sharp and cutting words, he governed his ministers with restraint, never dishonoring the great officials. Thus, the palace steps grew ever higher and the foundations ever firmer. The *Yì* says: *"To honor the lowly over the noble is to greatly win the people."* How different is this?

Lǎozǐ said: *"The noble takes the lowly as root; the high takes the low as foundation."*

I have often said that since the Three Dynasties, no ruler governed the world as well as the **Emperor Xiàowén**, yet his methods came from Lǎozǐ. Thus, the **Emperor Rénzǔ** revered the **Lǎozǐ** tradition for its simplicity and profundity. Examining it through the **Han Wén** model, I find no gap between them.

Though **Lǎozǐ** differed from **Kǒngzǐ**, their essence was the same. Though **Hàn** was inferior to **Zhōu**, its virtues were still worthy of adoption—this is why the two sages left enduring lessons.

In the fourth year of **Rénzǔ’s** reign, he told his ministers: *"Since I ascended the throne, I have appointed many **Cānzhī Zhìzhèng** (Chancellors and Deputy Chancellors). Among them, only **Cài Qí, Lǔ Zōngdào, and Xuē Kuí** were truly loyal and worthy of record. The Chancellors **Wáng Zēng** and **Zhāng Zhībái**, though occasionally making minor mistakes, never committed grave faults. **Lǐ Dí** was also upright and steadfast, though his words were often spoken too lightly."*

**Páng Jiè** replied: *"Great talent has always been rare."*

The Emperor said: *"I remember their great virtues, not their small failings."*

Reflecting on these words, I examined why **Wáng Zēng** and **Zhāng Zhībái** were held in such high regard by **Rénzǔ**—it was because they aided the **Wuwei** (non-action) governance with the **Qīngjìng** (tranquil and serene) method. This, perhaps, was what was truly memorable.

When the **Shěnxíng Yuàn** (Criminal Investigation Bureau) resolved all pending cases, **Rénzǔ** rejoiced: *"Though the realm is vast, the cases are settled thus—this shows how simple litigation is and how officials no longer delay."* He then issued an edict praising the judges and entrusted the matter to the **Shǐguān** (historiographical officials).

I observed that during the **Yuánfēng** era, the **Kāifēng Fǔ** prison was empty, and the late **Shénkǎo** (Emperor Shenzong) greatly rejoiced, promoting **Wáng Ānlǐ**—the Prefect of **Kāifēng**—to **Yòuchéng** (Right Chancellor). Even the lowly clerks received rewards. From then on, officials across the empire took an empty prison as a cause for celebration.

The **Emperor Rénzǔ** rewarded judges for simple litigation, while the **Emperor Shénkǎo** promoted officials for empty prisons—both demonstrated the same intent of benevolent governance toward the people.

Lǎozǐ said: *"The people do not ordinarily fear death. How can you terrify them with death? If you make the people constantly fear death, then those who act strangely, I can seize and kill—who would dare?"* The ancestors did not use penal threats to frighten the people; they understood **Lǎozǐ’s** teachings well.

While lecturing on the *Shījīng*, upon reaching *"Fěifēng"* (The Zephyr), the Emperor said: *"Lǎozǐ spoke of governing a great state as if boiling a small fish—its meaning aligns with this."*

**Shìdú Dīng Dù** replied: *"Boiling fish too much makes it break apart; governing the people too much scatters them. Without profound wisdom, how could one grasp the ancients’ intent for governance?"*

I said: *"In times when the sage-rulers had great undertakings—whether founding a dynasty or reforming corruption—some busyness was unavoidable. The **Emperor Rénzǔ**, however, upheld the **Qīngjìng-Wúwéi** (tranquil and non-action) Dao, remaining consistent for forty-two years. He truly embodied the principle of boiling fish gently and practiced it himself."*

Thus, I say that **Emperor Wén’s** methods came from **Lǎozǐ**, and **Emperor Rénzǔ’s** governance resembled **Emperor Wén’s** in many ways. When the **Emperor Shénkǎo** said that **Emperor Wén** was without flaw, his intention to follow and continue was clear.

**Hán Rào** reported: *"Lín Xiànkě sent his son with a letter to me, criticizing many faults of the officials inside and outside the court. I dared not withhold it from Your Majesty."*

The Emperor said: *"I do not wish to suppress it, but I fear it would open the path for slander. You may take it home and burn it."*

I said: *"Lǎozǐ said: ‘While the common people are bright and clear, I alone seem confused. While the common people are sharp and discerning, I alone am muddled.’ And again: ‘When governance is muddled, the people are pure. When governance is sharp, the people are depleted.’ **Hán Rào**, by reporting **Lín Xiànkě’s** words, presented both black and white—how bright and clear it is! The **Emperor Rénzǔ**, fearing to open the path of slander, rejected it. The sage’s foresight was profound and far-reaching.*

*"To be muddled and unseen, to be obscured and unrecognized—this is how the sage becomes sage, and why the people remain pure."*

When **Sīmǎ Guāng**, the **Tōngpàn** (Deputy Governor) of **Bìngzhōu**, submitted a memorial requesting the selection of a successor from the royal clan to serve as heir-apparent, I said: *"Since the mid-Tang, rulers disliked hearing discussions of establishing an heir, fearing it an omen of misfortune. Thus, scholars across the land dared not speak frankly about the foundation of the state’s security. **Sīmǎ Guāng**, though a distant official, spoke openly without concealment. The **Emperor Rénzǔ**, in his later years, received this advice without evasion. Lǎozǐ said: ‘To receive the Mandate of Heaven is not auspicious—this is how one becomes the King of the World.’ The **Emperor Rénzǔ** possessed this virtue. And again: ‘Faithful words are not beautiful.’ **Sīmǎ Guāng** embodied this too."*

**Chén Zhōngsù Gōng** said: *"Lǎozǐ spoke of the Mandate of Heaven as something divine that should not be seized, for those who seize it ruin it. He also said governing a great state is like boiling a small fish—yet the one who boils fish does nothing but regulate the fire and water to cook it properly. **Shùn** governed without action—was this not his meaning?"*

*"The **Emperor Wǔdì** abandoned **Huánglǎo** (Yellow Emperor-Laozi teachings) and adopted Confucianism, yet never strayed from benevolence and righteousness. Observing his actual results, however, he differed little from **Qín Shǐhuáng**. At that time, the realm was never without turmoil, and though people longed to emulate **Wén** and **Jǐng**, they could not. Thus, what fault did **Huánglǎo** truly have toward the world?"*

*"**Cú Guǎng** told his son **Shòu**: ‘Knowing contentment brings no disgrace; knowing when to stop brings no peril. When one’s official career is complete and reputation established, yet one does not depart, fearing future regret, then father and son may follow each other in feigning illness and returning home. The people of their time praised them, and later generations have sung their praises. Yet their intent to ‘know when to stop’ came from **Lǎozǐ’s** teachings."*

The *Daoist* texts are also found in *Liáo Zhāi Jí*.

Ouyang Xiu, the Duke of Wenzhong, remarked:
*"The succession of before and after, the contrast of length and shortness—when extended broadly, this is the principle of all things. Yet Laozi’s writings, though seemingly void, are supremely profound in governing the people."*

He further said:
*"The Daoist school originates from purity and emptiness, discarding ambition and desire, maintaining a tranquil self-guard. Thus it says: ‘If I do nothing, the people transform themselves; if I love stillness, the people align themselves.’ Even the Sage’s governance from the throne cannot surpass this. Also found in his own collection."*

Su Shi, the Duke of Yibin, said:
*"Upon receiving my nephew Mai’s compilation of my father’s handwritten works, one entry read: ‘Yesterday, Ziyou sent *Laozi’s New Interpretation*. I read it without finishing, then set it aside and sighed: If this book had existed in the Warring States, Confucius and Laozi would have been one. If it had existed in the Jin and Song dynasties, Buddhism and Daoism would not have been two.’ I never expected, in my old age, to encounter such a marvelous work—only then did I realize this book must have been intended for Zizhan."* (From the *Postscript to the Explanation of the Dao De Jing*.)

He further said:
*"Confucius governed the world with *rén* (benevolence), *yì* (righteousness), *lǐ* (ritual), and *yuè* (music), while Laozi rejected and abandoned them. Some may think they differ, but the *Yijing* says: ‘That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called *qi* (instrumentality).’ Confucius, foresighted for posterity, demonstrated *qi* to the people while concealing the Dao, so that mediocre individuals would cling to *qi* without being dazzled by the Dao, thus not losing their way as *junzi* (noble ones), while the superior would naturally ascend. Laozi, however, aimed to illuminate the Dao and urgently open the minds of people, thus emphasizing the Dao while neglecting *qi*, believing that if scholars only knew *qi*, the Dao would remain hidden. Therefore, he rejected benevolence and righteousness, abandoned ritual and music, to illuminate the Dao. These two Sages acted out of necessity—uniting in one meant neglecting the other."* (From the *Commentary on the Classic*.)

He further said:
*"Han Fei expounded Laozi’s teachings and used legalist rhetoric to persuade the feudal lords, while Li Si studied Xunzi and served Qin with deceit and force, culminating in the burning of books and the slaughter of Confucian scholars. Yet both met great calamity in the end. Their learning originated from the Sages, but their actions were what even common villagers would refuse to do. Could their learning truly have led them to this? Laozi and Xunzi’s teachings, though flawed, did not descend into chaos. Then why did these two men stray so far? A slight deviation in study—even a hair’s breadth—can lead to a thousand *li* of error."* (From *Lèchéng Jí*.)

Lü Dongshan, Master Tao, said:
*"Since Qin, the study of *xìngmìng* (nature and fate) has been neglected, and the division of *Dao* and *dé* (virtue/power) has long endured. Scholars, alas, are misled by one-sided, narrow interpretations, drowning daily in the vulgarity of commentaries, losing their innate nature and fate, unaware of the vast purity of Heaven and Earth or the grand framework of antiquity. I deeply lament this, believing that *Dao* and *dé* are what Guan Yin sincerely questioned and Laozi sincerely spoke of—containing profound and subtle truths that can awaken scholars from their ignorance, restoring their innate nature and fate. Unfortunately, obscured by vulgar commentaries for over a thousand years, their meaning remains dim. Thus, I composed this commentary to illuminate what was lost. Still, many Sages have existed in obscurity, and Laozi’s writings on *Dao* and *dé* were not unique—briefly expressed in Laozi, elaborated in *Liezi*, and further detailed in *Zhuangzi*. Therefore, my interpretations of *Liezi* and *Zhuangzi*, when combined, may not stray from the essence of *Dao* and *dé*."* (From the *Commentary on the Classic*.)

Luó Cóngyán, Master of Yanping, said:
*"Laozi’s book was neither praised nor criticized by Confucius, for praising it would have led later scholars to indulge in his ‘harmonizing with the dust’ teachings, descending into licentiousness, while criticizing it would have dismissed ‘tranquility as the foundation of governance’—which could not be condemned. Since neither praise nor criticism was given, he could not remain silent, thus merely saying: ‘I compare him to my old friend Peng.’"* (From *Luó Shī’s Yùlù*.)

When asked, Yang Shoujing, the Duke of Guishan, replied:
*"Some say ‘Lao Peng’ refers to Laozi and Peng Zu, not Peng’s longevity, but rather ‘the aged Peng.’ But did Laozi truly record without creating, believing and loving antiquity?"*
He answered: *"Laozi took *zìrán* (naturalness) as his foundation, so calling it ‘uncreated’ is acceptable."* (From *Guishan Jí*.)

Guishan further said:
*"Only when all selfishness is removed can one respond to the world. Laozi said: ‘The public becomes the king.’"* (From *Yùlù*.)

Lü Xizhe of Rongyang once inscribed on the wall before him: *"In governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality."* He said: *"Scholars of cultivation consider this the essential method for nurturing life, but frugality in all matters—always maintaining surplus—is the way to preserve oneself, one’s family, and the state."* (From *Kǒuguó Shì Zálù*.)

Wang Zishun, Saintly Beauty, said:
*"Zhuangzi could not fathom Liezi, and Liezi could not fathom Laozi."*

The Duke of Rongyang replied:
*"If Zhuangzi could not fathom Liezi, who could? If Liezi could not fathom Laozi, who could? Thus, none surpassed Zhuangzi in understanding Liezi, and none surpassed Liezi in understanding Laozi."* (From *Lǚ Shì’s Shīyǒu Zázhì*.)

Sima Guang wrote to Wang Anshi:
*"In the past, I followed you in your studies. You read all the books, yet particularly favored the words of Mencius and Laozi. Now that you hold power and implement your Dao, you should prioritize what you admire—you would not prioritize what you do not."*

Mencius said:
*"Ren and righteousness are enough—why must one speak of profit?"*
He also said:
*"To be a parent to the people, yet make them toil endlessly throughout the year without means to support their own parents, then lend them money at interest—how can this be called being a parent to the people?"*

Now, Wang Anshi’s governance begins with establishing the *Chizhi Tiaoli* Bureau, expounding on matters of wealth and profit. He then commands Xue Xiang to implement the *Junyun* tax system in Jiang-Huai, seeking to seize all the merchants’ gains. He dispatches envoys to distribute *qingmiao* loans nationwide, collecting their interest—causing people to grieve, separating fathers from sons, and brothers from wives and children. Is this truly Mencius’ intent?

Laozi said:
*"The sacred treasure of the world cannot be acted upon—those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it."* He also said:
*"If I do nothing, the people transform themselves; if I love stillness, the people align themselves; if I undertake no tasks, the people grow wealthy; if I have no desires, the people return to simplicity."* And again:
*"To govern a great state is like poaching a small fish."*

Yet Wang Anshi’s governance overturns all ancestral laws—reversing what was first and last, high and low, right and left, and destroying what was already accomplished. He toils tirelessly from dawn to dusk, laboring into the night without rest, leaving no one—from the court to the fields—able to follow old customs or maintain stability. All is in chaos, and none find peace. Is this truly Laozi’s intent?

Sima Guang, who styled himself *Youshou* ("the Detoured Old Man"), once wrote in his *Youshu* ("Book of Detours"):
*"Someone asked if my* Old and Recluse *chapter had any meaning. I replied: It does.*
*‘What meaning?’ they asked.*
*‘The* Recluse *takes its emptiness; Laozi takes its effortless spontaneity.’*
*He also wrote: ‘Those who study the Yellow Emperor and Laozi claim to be like dead ashes and withered wood to achieve* wuwei*—but I disagree. In my* Wuwei Zan *(‘Ode to Effortless Action’), one cultivates the heart with rectitude, preserves the body with stillness, advances and retreats with propriety, accepts gain and loss as fate, guards the Dao within oneself, and lets success arise from Heaven. What more is there to do? All is already natural.’"*

From Sima Guang’s *Chuanjia Ji* ("Transmitted Family Collection").

Li Deyu, Duke Wei, in his memorial urging Emperor Jingzong to search for Daoist masters, said:
*"I have heard that the highest Dao belongs to Guangchengzi and Xuanyuan, while the most sagely among men are Xuanyuan and Confucius. In ancient times, Xuanyuan asked Guangchengzi about the essentials of nurturing life. Guangchengzi replied:
‘See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness—then the body will align itself, the spirit will purify itself. Do not weary your form, do not scatter your essence—only then can you attain longevity.’*
*He also said:
‘Those who grasp my Dao rule as emperor above or king below.’*
*Xuanyuan spoke to Confucius:
‘Abandon your arrogance and excessive desires, your frivolous demeanor and licentious thoughts—for these bring no benefit to your body. The five mouths of your senses warn you of this. Thus, Xuanyuan sighed with the heavens’ lament, and Confucius awoke with the awe of a dragon. The ancient sages’ attainment of the Dao was not so profound?’*
*If Guangchengzi and Xuanyuan were to appear before you today and speak of the Dao, I dare say nothing surpasses their words."*

From *Li Wenrao Ji* ("Collected Works of Li Wenrao").

Bai Xingjian, Master of Xiangshan, said:
*"To cultivate simplicity and frugality in the people, and harmony in the times, nothing surpasses embodying the Dao of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Their way lies in valuing moderation and simplicity, avoiding dazzling the ears and eyes, and not exhausting the mind and abilities.*
*Those who wield it skillfully—whether in a single town, prefecture, state, or the world—can achieve the principle of tranquility.*
*In the past, Mi Jian attained it, so single-handedly transformed Renhua’s governance without leaving his hall. Jin Pi attained it, so accomplished East Sea’s administration without stepping outside his gate. Cao Shen attained it, so markets and lawsuits were undisturbed, and Qi became serene. Emperor Wen of Han attained it, so punishments were unused, and the world found harmony. The reason is simple: tranquility brings order."*

From Bai’s *Changqing Ji* ("Collected Works of the Long Regency").

Su Shi, Master of Dongpo, in response to imperial command, inscribed the *Shangqing Chuxiang* Palace stele:
*"I have examined the Daoist tradition, which originates with the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Its essence is tranquility and effortless action; its practice is clarity and responsiveness; its conduct is compassion and frugality without contention. This aligns with the* Yi Jing’s *‘no thought, no worry’* and the* Analects’* teaching that ‘the virtuous are still and long-lived.’*
*Since the Qin and Han, Daoists have adopted alchemists’ claims, introducing techniques of flying ascension and transformation—Yellow Court, Great Cavern methods, the* Taishang Tianzhen Mugong Jinmu *elixirs, and worship of the Celestial Sovereign, Taiyi, Ziming, and Beiji. Even minor talismans and spells fall under Daoist practice.*
*I have reflected: the Dao of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi is the root; the alchemists’ words are the branches.*

*In his* Gaigong Tang Ji *('Record of Gaigong Hall'), he also wrote:
‘When Cao Shen served as Chancellor of Qi, he heard that Gaigong of Jiaxi excelled in Yellow-Lao teachings. He sent envoys to invite him, and under his guidance, Qi flourished. Later, Cao Shen applied these principles to govern the empire, and to this day, the world praises his virtue.
*As Jiaxi’s magistrate, I sought his descendants and tomb but found none. Moved, I emulated his words and imagined his character. Cao Shen, a pillar of the Han dynasty, took Gaigong as his teacher—what greater honor could there be? Yet history records nothing of Gaigong’s end. Was he not an ancient sage who attained the Dao and did not die?’"*

From his own *Ji* ("Collected Works").

Tang Geng of Meishan’s *Zixi* remarks:

*"The world doubts that Laozi’s western journey was motivated by compassion, frugality, or avoiding premature death. If one upholds the Dao in the world, where cannot they dwell? Yet still there are departures and arrivals—this is utterly mistaken. Only because the Dao is without a place it cannot enter does it traverse even the most barbaric lands. This is why it is the Dao of Laozi."*

From *Meishan Ji*.

Zhang Youshi’s *Laozi Yi* states:

*"When people are born, those not killed by illness in bed or by thieves, executions, or punishments already exceed half. Thus, people do not truly fear death. Yet those who govern others wish to make them fear death, relying only on threats of it—how deluded! Therefore it is said: ‘If the people do not fear death, how can you terrify them with death?’ If they truly feared death, then I would seize and kill those who act strangely, and surely none would dare. The issue is not that there are no killers, but that all things, dim and indistinct, inevitably return to annihilation. Thus, there are always those who kill. If one takes the natural order of killing and applies it to instilling fear, it is not only insufficient to terrify others but also fails to reach its mark. Therefore it is said: ‘There are always those who kill. If one replaces those who kill, it is like having a substitute carpenter—few will avoid harming their hands.’ Thus, to wield the power of life and death, driving an age’s people to follow, is surely wrong.*

*Again, it is said: Only because it is without private gain can it fulfill its private purpose, and only when private gain is sought does the world reject it. Only the public can grasp the true nature of the world, and the world will follow. If the world follows, how can one fail to obtain what they desire?*

*In his preface for the *Sequence for Master Zhang of Gushu*, he wrote: The most gentle teaching instructed me on the subtleties of nurturing nature. He said: ‘The Great Dao is most simple—merely preserve the heart. Preserving the heart is nothing else but preserving the One. When the One is perfectly still, the Mysterious flows freely in all directions. True qi responds to it—this cannot be measured by thought or exhausted by speech; only those who attain it know it. When true qi descends, all ailments vanish, and longevity follows. Laozi said: *Empty the heart, fill the belly, weaken the will, strengthen the bones*—when the heart is empty and the will weak, the belly naturally fills, and the bones naturally strengthen. This Dao: the wise attain it and call it *stopping and observing*; Sima Ziqian attained it and called it *sitting in forgetfulness*—both are the same Dao. These are the essentials for the True Person in cultivating the self, yet today’s people neglect them, instead tormenting their bodies, indulging in vain transformations, swallowing elixirs of metal and stone—how distant they are from the Dao!’*

From *his Ji*.

Wang Wuqiu once expounded on four chapters of the *Laozi Dao Jing*. Here are two:

*"The Sage acts in non-action, teaches without speech. Those without intent to act or speak merely follow the natural patterns of all things’ life and death. Thus, when all things arise, I too arise without refusal; when all things are born, I too am born without possession; when all things act, I too act without reliance; when all things are completed, I too complete without taking credit. For their arising, their birth, their action, and their completion are all in accordance with the natural patterns of life and death, following things and times without being ‘I.’ Then why must I refuse, why must I possess, why must I rely, why must I take credit? Therefore it is said: ‘All things arise together, yet I do not refuse; they are born, yet I do not possess; they act, yet I do not rely; their deeds are complete, yet I do not take credit. Arise, then be born; be born, then act; act, then complete—this is their order.’*

*Again, it says: Why does Laozi particularly detest excessive speech? What Laozi clarifies is the Dao, which is always without speech. Yet when speech is unavoidable, it is permitted. Because it is unavoidable, speech is allowed; because it is always without speech, those who speak much are farthest from the Dao, and those who speak little are closer. Thus, he particularly detests excessive speech."*

From *his Ji*.

Qin Guan of Huaihai remarked:

*"Ban Gu praised Sima Qian for his judgments being somewhat contrary to the Sage’s intent, saying that in discussing the Great Dao, he prioritized Yellow-Lao over the Six Classics. Who would have thought that Qian, with his vast talent and erudition, would reach such a conclusion? In my view, this is incorrect—he truly had insight and expressed it. Mencius said: ‘The benevolent is humanity; combined, it is the Dao.’ Yang Zhu also said: ‘The Dao guides them, virtue obtains them, benevolence enters them, righteousness harmonizes them, ritual embodies them—this is Heaven.’ Combined, they are unified; separated, they scatter. Thus, morality and virtue are the complete embodiment of benevolence, righteousness, and ritual, while benevolence, righteousness, and ritual are but one aspect of morality and virtue. Yellow-Lao learning values unity and despises separation, so it takes the Dao as the foundation, while the teachings of the Six Classics are brief on unity and detailed on separation. Thus, it uses benevolence, righteousness, and ritual as applications. When Qian discussed the Great Dao, he prioritized Yellow-Lao over the Six Classics—could this not be his insight expressed?"*

*Again, it says: "History records that Cui Hao compared himself to Zhang Liang, claiming his study of antiquity surpassed him. In my view, Hao did not even reach the level of Xun and Jia—how dare he aspire to Zi Fang? For he refined himself through cultivation, and with his remaining energy, governed the world. Having achieved his purpose, he withdrew to preserve himself—this is the lineage of the Daoist school."*

Observing celestial phenomena and discerning seasonal changes to aid human affairs—clear in its applications yet ignorant of their roots—this is the lineage of the **Yin-Yang** school.

Zhang Liang first wandered to **Xiaona**, receiving scriptures from the **Old Man of the Bridge**, and ultimately wished to abandon worldly affairs to follow **Chi Song**—thus, his methods clearly stem from the **Daoist** school.

Cui Hao excelled in the study of **divination and numerology**, his accounts of **Yinghuo’s** entry into Qin, the comet’s extinction of Jin, and matters such as the hare emerging from the rear palace, along with Yao Xing’s offering of a daughter, were most extraordinary. Yet when he dismissed the **Zhuang-Lao** teachings as fabricated, his methods were clearly rooted in **Yin-Yang** alone—this is why they differ.

(All as recorded in the *Huaihai Collection*.)

**Tian Xian** wrote in his preface to the *Precious Wood Inscription*:
*"The dragon’s rise begins with wood; the ruler’s ascent begins with the people."* Yet there are also **saints without rank** and **virtuous recluses**, blending fame with obscurity, and talent with humility. A man of **Li Ming’s** caliber was Confucius’ **Precious Wood**—thus able to expound the *Spring and Autumn Annals* to establish enduring teachings. **Yin Xi’s** virtue was Laozi’s **Precious Wood**—thus able to inquire into **Dao and virtue** to benefit posterity.

(As seen in the *Xianping Collection*.)

**Fan Zhongwen**, Duke of **Zhen**, remarked:
*"Laozi’s two treatises discuss the primordial **Dao** before **Yin-Yang** coalesced—concise in words yet complete in meaning."*

(Recorded in the *Shu Gong Collection*.)

**Chao Wenyuan**, Duke **Jiong**, said:
*"Many eminent figures, past and present, cherished the books of Laozi and Zhuangzi, for within their **non-action and non-affairs** lies the utmost beauty and joy."*

He further stated:
*"Laozi said: ‘Five colors blind the eyes; five tones deafen the ears; five flavors dull the palate.’ Though even sages may overcorrect, their intent is deeply benevolent. If one does not indulge the pleasures of the ears and eyes nor the delights of the mouth and stomach, one need not seek attainment—only avoid loss."*

(All as seen in the *Zhaode Xinbian*.)

He also noted:
*"Laozi said: ‘Knowing the constant is clarity.’ Worldly folk see only day and night as constant, yet remain unchanged. Those beyond the world regard life and death as day and night, knowing that life and death are constant while nature remains unchanged. Thus, the mind is clear and serene, viewing life and death without distress."*

(Recorded in the *Maozhi Yushu*.)

**Li Tai** of **Xujing** quoted **Han Yu** as saying:
*"The Daoists claim, ‘Confucius was my teacher’s disciple,’ and the Buddhists say, ‘Confucius was my teacher’s disciple.’ Those who follow Confucius hear these claims, delight in their absurdity, and mock them, saying, ‘My teacher also said such things.’ I cannot fully grasp the Buddhist teachings, but the *Zengzi Wen* and *Laozi Liezhuan* mention matters of ritual—history cannot be fully trusted, and the *Records of Ritual* are not without fabrication."*

(As seen in the *Tuiju Leicao*.)

**Jiao Sayu**, a recluse of **Songshan**, remarked:
*"After Fu Xi, King Wen, and the Duke of Zhou expounded the *Yijing*, only Laozi mastered its flexible transformations—knowing softness yet valuing emptiness, striving to respond yet unable to grasp it. His earnest words are fortunate to have been preserved."*

He further said:
*"Wang Bi’s commentary on Laozi’s *Daode Jing* truly captures Laozi’s teachings—akin to **Yan Junping’s** *Zhigui* in its precision. His claim that **benevolence, righteousness, and ritual** cannot stand alone but require the **Dao** to function is not merely beneficial to Laozi—it is essential knowledge for the nine hundred scholars."*

He also noted:
*"Wang Bi understood that ‘fine weapons are ill-omened,’ yet his interpretation of ‘treating victory with funeral rites’ was not Laozi’s own but rather **Riverbank Master’s**—the ancient text lacked this, thanks to **Fu Yi’s** discernment for its correction."*

(As recorded in his own collection.)

**Li Zhaoquan** stated:
*"The books of **Ghost Valley** and **Han Fei** trace back to **Dao and virtue**, yet their timing aligns with **mystical profundity**. How could these two truly comprehend Laozi? Their words merely hit the mark."*

(As seen in the *Luan Jing’s Collection*.)

**Bi Zhongban**, of **Xitai**, remarked:
*"Laozi said: ‘Lose the **Dao**, then **virtue**; lose **virtue**, then **benevolence**; lose **benevolence**, then **ritual**—ritual is the **Dao’s** adornment yet the source of chaos.’ To call ritual the **Dao’s** adornment and the origin of chaos is beyond my understanding. Yet ritual is indeed secondary to **benevolence and righteousness**, and inferior to **Dao and virtue**. Later generations, unable to govern with ritual alone, entrusted it to **law**—which is again secondary to ritual, and inferior to **benevolence and righteousness.**"*

(As recorded in his own collection.)

**Su Xu** of **Meishan**, grandson of **Wendefeng**, recorded his grandfather’s last words:
*"The Master lectured me on several chapters of Laozi, saying: ‘He surpasses Mencius by two or three levels.’*
*He also said: ‘No text surpasses the Five Thousand Words in speaking of the **Great Dao**.’*
*In his old age, the Master composed poetry:
‘I have preserved eighty-one chapters of commentary,
A disciple of Laozi’s **Old Plum** school.
As age deepens, my craft grows refined—
The ordinary cannot fathom it.’"*

(As recorded in his last words.)

During the **Qianfeng** era of the **Tang High宗** (Emperor Gaozong), in the second month of the first year (on the day *jiwu*), the Emperor visited **Laozi’s Temple** in **Bozhou** and posthumously bestowed upon him the title **太上玄元皇帝** (Supreme Primordial Sovereign Emperor).

During the **Tianbao** era of the **Tang Xuanzong** (Emperor Xuanzong), in the first month of the second year (on the day *jingchen*), the Emperor posthumously honored **Laozi** as **大圣祖** (Great Holy Ancestor), and **Laozi’s father**, **Zhou Shang Gongshi** (Grand Marshal of Zhou), as **先天太上皇** (Primordial Supreme Emperor). His mother, **Ben Shou Shi**, was honored as **先天太后** (Primordial Empress Dowager).

In the tenth month of the **fourteenth year of Tianbao**, the Emperor issued imperial commentaries on *Laozi* (*Laozi’s Text*) as well as the *Yishu* (Explanatory Commentary) across the land.

Additionally, during the **Tianbao** era, the Emperor added the title **《玄通道德经》** (Mysterious and Penetrating Dao-De Jing) to *Laozi*, though this title was not widely adopted. (As recorded in the *New Book of Tang · Arts and Literature Register*.)

In the **sixth year of Da Zhong Xiangfu**, during the eighth month (on the day *gengwu*), an imperial decree added **Laozi’s title** as **太上老君混元上德皇帝** (Supreme Primordial Lord of the Dao, the Ultimate Emperor of Highest Virtue). The following spring, in the first month (on the day *renyin*), the Emperor departed **Eastern Capital (Dongjing)**, and on the third month (on the day *bingwu*), arrived at **Zhenyuan County**. On the fifth month (on the day *wushen*), he ordered the Chancellor **Wang Dan** to present the imperial seal and title, and on the sixth month (on the day *jiyou*), he paid homage at **Ta Qing Palace**. (As recorded in the *Nine Dynasties’ Temple Regulations*.)

In the **second year of Jingde**, the **National University’s** (Guozijian) **Senior Lecturer Sun Xi** stated:
*"Among the books of the various schools, Laozi and Zhuangzi are ranked first. Their teachings emphasize the clarity and emptiness of the Dao, advocating humility and weakness to preserve oneself, and effortless ease to sustain oneself. Their methods of nurturing life and benefiting all things are all the arts of the sage ruling from the south."* (As recorded in the *Comprehensive Records of the Current Dynasty*.)

Thus, earlier scholars placed *Laozi*’s text secondary to the **classics**, and **Lu Deming** of the Tang compiled *The Exegesis of the Classic Texts* in thirty volumes, including *Laozi’s Exegesis* in three volumes. Today, the exegeses of all classics and *Laozi’s Exegesis* total twenty-seven volumes, all of which have been engraved and distributed. Only *Zhuangzi’s Exegesis* remains missing in three volumes. Sun Xi proposed following the example of the *Dao-De Jing*, dispatching officials to verify and engrave it for distribution, and the decree approved this. (As recorded in the *Comprehensive Records of the Current Dynasty*.)

In the **third year of Tianxi**, when celestial scriptures descended, **Sun Xi**, who served as **Jizhou Prefect** in **Qianyoushan**, submitted a memorial stating:
*"The lowly **Zhu Neng** falsely claims divine omens and portents. In the past, the **Tang Minghuang** (Emperor Xuanzong) obtained the *Lingbao Shangqing Huguo Jing* (Scripture of the Sacred Treasure of the Numinous Treasure and High Clarity) and the *Baojuan* (Treasure Scroll), all fabricated by **Wang Jue** and **Tian Tongxiu** and others.
The **Dao** of **Laozi**, the Sage, descending in words, should naturally be without falsehood. Yet since the **An-Lu Rebellion** of the Tang, both capitals were destroyed and overthrown—how could the realm be in perfect harmony? The **Minghuang** barely managed to return to the palace before being again abducted by the **Fuguo Rebellion**, ultimately dying from exhaustion. **Laozi’s** sacred longevity is boundless; how could he have failed to achieve eternal life and lasting vision?
Since the **Minghuang** was misled by leftist doctrines, his governance became disordered, the people’s hearts turned away, and calamities arose suddenly. I pray that Your Majesty may take heed of the **Minghuang’s** summoning of disaster, so that misfortune may not arise and turmoil may not occur."* (As recorded in the *Nine Dynasties’ Temple Regulations*.)

During the **revolt of Fang La** in **Zheyou**, whose cries shook the capital, the **Chancellor’s Office Attendant Cheng Zhen** told **Chancellor Wang Pi**:
*"It would be appropriate to seize this moment to discuss the ills of the realm, so that some reforms might be made and the people’s hearts might be pacified."* **Wang Pi** was displeased. At the time, **Cheng Zhen** also served as **Attendant to the Prince**, and when he reached **Shu Palace** to see the **Prince**, he said:
*"When **Zhou Gong** (Duke of Zhou) composed the poem *‘Jiangliu’* (Owl), **Confucius** praised it as profound wisdom. Its words merely speak of awaiting the heavens’ rain and harmonizing the eaves and doors. **Laozi** also said, ‘Act before things arise; govern before chaos ensues.’ Truly, **Laozi** and **Confucius** share this principle. Now, if we do not establish the roots of governance in times of tranquility, but merely vie for immediate results, this is not the intent of the two Sages."* (As recorded in the *Nine Dynasties’ Temple Regulations* and *Biographies of Eastern Capital* in his own transmission.)

In the **sixth year of Zhenghe**, **Li Gang**, then **Assistant Censor in the Ministry of Justice**, petitioned the Emperor in a memorial requesting clarification on the *Yijing* (Classic of Changes), stating in part:
*"I humbly observe that Your Majesty’s celestial wisdom and brilliance are unparalleled, and that You are aided by the study of **Jixi** (Refined Brightness) and **Guangming** (Enlightened Clarity). You embody the **primordial** and master the **mysterious**, encompassing the full scope of symbols and numbers. Even in the midst of Your countless affairs of state, You instruct and elucidate the books of **Laozi** and **Zhuangzi**, awakening scholars across the land with eloquent and profound words. These words reveal what cannot be spoken and illuminate the radiant principles of **Dao**, **virtue**, and **life-force**.
The *Yijing* speaks of neither thought nor action—it is still and unmoving, yet responsive, thus communicating the patterns of the world. Truly, it complements the books of **Laozi** and **Zhuangzi** in its ultimate expression.
I pray that Your Majesty may reflect deeply within Your heart and compose commentaries to unfold the **divine virtue** and reveal the **profound essence** of the cosmos.

Additionally, he inscribed a poem on **Li Bo Shi’s** (Li Gonglin) painting of *Laozi’s Departure from the Pass*, which reads:
‘I ask of the **Gate of All Wonders**—how does it remain constant?
At that time, **Guan Yin** (Laozi’s disciple) was so diligent in his purpose.
The **Green Ox** departs westward toward the desert sands,
While **Purple Qi** arrives eastward, its auspicious mists revealed.
The **mysterious art** does not stray from the **Thirty-Six Strategies**,
The **ultimate words** are all contained in the **Five Thousand Characters**.
The world fails to grasp the **Root of Benevolence and Simplicity**,
Only seeking eternal life by following the **White Clouds**.’

(As recorded in the *Liangxi Collection*.)

**Master Cheng Yi** of **I Chuan** (Program Precept) said:
*"The teachings of the Daoists have no further flaws to criticize, but the sayings of the **Buddhist School** have proliferated into such deep confusion and delusion that they cannot be refuted."*

Again, he said:
*"The words of **Zhuangzi** in describing the **Dao** have much merit, and the chapter *‘Gu shen bu si’* (Nurturing the Spirit and Not Letting It Die) is the finest."*

(As recorded in **Master Cheng’s** posthumous writings.)

**Hu An Guo**, the **Minister of War**, said:
*"The **Five Thousand Words** of **Laozi**, such as his sayings ‘I have no affairs,’ ‘I love tranquility,’ and ‘I possess the Three Treasures,’ are all profound truths."*

(As recorded in the *Language Records*.)

The **inscription of Xicang’s** (She Yi’s) **Shou Shou Pavilion** states:
*"The **Ren** (benevolence) that **Confucius** spoke of brings longevity, and the **‘not dying though dead’** longevity that **Laozi** spoke of, as well as the **‘boundless longevity’** of the **Buddhist School**—though the words of the three Sages differ, their meanings are the same.
The **Ren** exhausts one’s **nature** (xing), and exhausting one’s **nature** means one does not perish though dead. If one does not perish though dead, how could one’s longevity be measured?
Those who merely see the hair, nails, and teeth returning to the earth, the saliva and tears merging with water, the warmth of **qi** returning to fire, and movement transforming into wind, assume that the person has truly died. Yet they fail to recognize that the **Dao** remains ever-present and never truly dies."*

The *Dixian* [玉诀类] continues:

From *Xitang Ji* [溪堂集], **Zhou Zhonggong of Daoxiang** [道乡邹忠公浩] says:
The **Mysterious Female Gate** [玄牝之门], drawn from our own person, is the **nose** [鼻]. The nose is the passage through which **qi** [息] enters and exits. If it flows continuously as if ever-present, and one does not strain it, then the breath becomes profound—such was **Sun Shu’ao’s** [孙叔敖] nose, ever vibrant.

The *Zhuangzi* [《庄子》] states:
The **True Person’s** [真人] breath reaches to the heels,
While the common man’s breath stops at the throat.
Those who bend and submit speak with a rasping voice,
And those who hoard desires have shallow **innate vitality** [天机].

The *Suwen* [《素问》] says:
Without **inhalation and exhalation**, there would be no growth, maturation, aging, or death.
Without **ascension and descent**, there would be no growth, transformation, contraction, or storage.
Ascension and descent, inhalation and exhalation—
No vessel lacks these four, yet their **virtue** [德] lies in steadfastly guarding them.
Only when one knows this does one understand how the **Spirit of the Valley** [谷神] does not die.

It further says:
Empty your mind, and your **abdomen** [腹] will naturally fill.
Weaken your will, and your bones will naturally strengthen.

All as seen in *Daoxiang Ji* [《道乡集》].

**Master Kangjie Shao Yong** [康节先生邵雍] says:
The **Three Sovereigns** [三皇] share the same **Dao** but differ in transformation.
The **Five Emperors** [五帝] speak the same words but differ in teachings.
The **Three Kings** [三王] share the same symbols but differ in governance.
The **Five Hegemons** [五伯] share the same numbers but differ in methods.

To share the same **Dao** yet differ in transformation—
This must be done through the **Way** [道].
Those who govern through the **Way** will have the people return to the **Way**,
Thus valuing **spontaneity** [自然].
**Spontaneity** means **non-action** [无为] and **non-possession** [无有].
**Non-action** is not inaction, but not clinging to action—
Thus it can be expansive.
**Non-possession** is not lack, but not clinging to possession—
Thus it can be vast.
When **broad and great**, fully present yet not fixed in possession—
Who but the **Three Sovereigns** could embody this?

Thus, those who know how to govern the world through the **Way**
Will see the world return to the **Way**.
Hence the saying:
*"I do not act, yet the people transform themselves.
I do not interfere, yet the people grow rich.
I love stillness, yet the people align themselves.
I have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.
Is this not the case?"*
As seen in *Guanyu Pian* [《观物篇》] of his own collection.

**Shao Bowen** [邵伯温] says:
Master Kangjie believed **Laozi** understood the **substance** [体] of the *Yijing*,
And **Mencius** understood its **application** [用].
In his commentary on *Wen Zhongzi*, he praised **Buddha** as a **sage of the Western Land** [西方之圣人],
And this was not excessive.
As seen in *Shao Shi Wenjian Lu* [《邵氏闻见录》].

**Su Dongpo’s** inscription on the **Shangqing Palace** [上清宫] stele reads:
The **Daoist tradition** [道家者流] originates with **Huangdi and Laozi** [黄帝老子].
Its **Way** centers on **clarity, stillness, and non-action** [清静无为].
Its **application** lies in **emptiness and luminosity** [虚明应物].
Its **conduct** is **compassion and frugality, non-contention** [慈俭不争].
This aligns with the *Zhouyi* [《周易》]: *"No thinking, no worrying"* [何思何虑],
And the *Analects* [《论语》]: *"The virtuous attain longevity through stillness"* [仁者静寿].
Such is all.

**Xie Xiandao** [谢显道] personally witnessed **Programming Yichuan** [程伊川] reciting these lines,
And deemed them the most profound discussion of **Ren** [仁] in antiquity.
As recorded in **Zhao Bo’s** *Wenjian Hou Lu* [《闻见后录_] and **Xie’s** *Yulu* [《语录》].

**Zheng Xia of Xitang** [西塘郑侠] says:
I have heard **Laozi** say:
*"Knowing contentment brings no disgrace,
Knowing limits brings no peril."*
The *Yijing* [《易》] states:
*"Excess (亢) is to know advancement yet not retreat,
To know preservation yet not annihilation,
To know gain yet not loss—
Only the **Sage** knows advancement, retreat, preservation, annihilation, gain, and loss
Without losing their proper alignment."*

Yet how difficult it is to know retreat, annihilation, contentment, and limits,
While the **Sage** repeatedly extols them with deep reverence!

He says:
All these are **one**.
Advancement and retreat follow the **Way**—
Then advancement is not arduous, and retreat is not difficult.
Preservation and annihilation follow the **Way**—
Then preservation brings no joy, and annihilation brings no sorrow.
Advancement, retreat, preservation, and annihilation all return to the **Way**,
Stopping when it is time to stop, moving when it is time to move—
Who could say they are not in harmony?

He further says:
The **Superior Person** hears the **Way** and diligently practices it.
The **Middle Person** hears the **Way** and clings to it uncertainly.
The **Lesser Person** hears the **Way** and laughs at it—
If they do not laugh, it is not the **Way**.

He says:
Only the **Way** is great,
Thus it seems unworthy.
If it were long deemed worthy, it would be trifling indeed.
**Worthiness** arises from nurturing what is small—
For the common nurture only the small,
Thus the great is deemed unworthy.
Yet to seek the **Way**,
One must embrace what the common deem unworthy,
For what the common do not deem unworthy—
These are not worthy of discussing the **Way**.

He says:
The **Way** is great while things are small.
Men toil endlessly yet perish in the small—
They are burdened by things.
**Primordiality** [元] is the ultimate extension of goodness,
Reaching the greatest magnitude.
When it reaches greatness yet remains unknown as such,
It aligns with the **Way** yet does not resemble the world.
Thus the world calls my **Way** great yet unworthy,
For while others scrutinize and compete,
I alone am serene, deeming the world unworthy of my concern.
It is fitting that I do not resemble them,
Thus I can achieve greatness.
Great yet possessing it—
I surpass the world by an inch.
Thus I am deemed unworthy.
Only when the **Lesser Person** laughs at this
Do I approach understanding.
For if the **Way** were deemed worthy, it would not be the **Way**.

He says:
**Laozi** said:
*"Water benefits all things yet does not contend.
It dwells where others abhor it,
Thus it nears the **Way**."*
Yet when water stagnates and rots,
Becoming foul and impure—
Unfit even for washing one’s feet—
This is self-inflicted, nearing the **abhorrent**.
Those who seek to restore their **original nature** [复性]
Should take this as a mirror:
Know that clarity and luminosity come from **innate nature** [自我性],
While turbidity and chaos arise from **what is acquired** [自我之有].
Abandoning the murky and confused,
Clarity and luminosity manifest within—
Then, rising with the waves and sinking with the mud,
None can resist my transformation.
Because none can resist my transformation,
They will repose in purity and clarity,
Yet none will know my power.

He says again:

Water’s nature is clear, yet it emerges from the earth,
and the earth muddies it—thus its turbidity.
But if one lets it settle, it becomes clear enough
to mirror hair and threads.

Human insight is bright, yet it arises from things,
and things confuse it—thus its chaos.
But if one lets it clarify, it can illuminate sun and moon.

Once clear, if muddied, it becomes turbid;
but if left to settle, it returns to its original clarity.
Once bright, if confused, it becomes chaotic;
but if left to clarify, it returns to brightness.

Thus, what is turbid and chaotic is always imposed from without,
while what is clear and bright arises from within.

The *Classical Texts* say:
*"Heaven and Earth unite to descend sweet dew—
no one commands it, yet it is evenly distributed."*

Though rain and dew are subtle in Heaven and Earth,
they are yet so evenly distributed—
how much more so for the luminous and intelligent mind of humankind!

He says again:
Before the Three Dynasties, there were no teachings of Confucius, Mencius, Laozi, or the Buddha.
Yet when one encountered an emperor, one became an emperor;
when one encountered a king, one became a king.
But from the decline of the Zhou onward,
only the teachings of the Three Masters [孔孟老] and the Buddha arose—
truly, they were concerned with the world’s delusion
and sought to guide it toward salvation.

He once wrote in his *Preface to the Great Celebration Hermit*:
*"The Hermit was originally weak in learning,
taking Confucius as his master,
and found Laozi’s teachings to clarify it.
All of this is recorded in the *Xitang Collection*."*

Yue Mengde said:
*"The *Book of Documents* ends with Yao and Shun,
yet the *Yijing* extends back to Fuxi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor—
thus we know that there were indeed figures before Yao,
though the Six Classics remain silent on them."*

If one examines this with the mind,
the *Yijing* says:
*"The Dao has no thought, no action—
silent and unmoving, yet responding,
it naturally permeates all under Heaven.
Who but the most divine of sages could attain this?"*

Thus, from Fuxi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor down to Yao and Shun,
what was transmitted through the ages
was never outside the *Yijing*.

Reflecting further on Laozi’s teachings,
one finds little that differs from the *Yijing*.

He says again:
*"The *Analects* records that Confucius compared himself to Laozi and Pengzu.
After Confucius came Mencius,
and though Mencius’ Confucianism never faltered by so much as a hair,
his rejection of Yang Zhu and Mozi,
and his opposition to ritualistic Qin,
exceeded even Jie and Zhou—
yet he never reached Laozi’s depth.
But when it came to ‘exhausting the heart to know nature,
and extending to fate,’
this was where Laozi’s focus lay."*

Thus, Laozi’s teachings were never neglected by Confucius and Mencius.

He says again:
*"Where Laozi’s words differ from Confucius’,
they are corrective for the age;
where they align, they accord with the *Yijing*."*

Hundreds of years after Laozi, the Buddha emerged,
his language ever more profound and distant from ordinary speech,
yet in its ultimate truth, it nearly mirrors Laozi’s teachings—
as seen in the commentaries.

He says again:
*"Laozi speaks of *qi* and desire—
concentrating *qi* to achieve softness like an infant.
Mencius speaks of *qi* as vast and mighty,
directly nurtured without harm,
filling Heaven and Earth.
These two seem contradictory.
If one follows Laozi, Mencius is abandoned;
if one follows Mencius, Laozi is abandoned.
Yet in my view, the two are not truly opposed:
when human *qi* is dispersed, it clashes with things and becomes rigid;
when concentrated, it turns inward and becomes soft.

Rigidity cannot overcome rigidity—
what overcomes rigidity must be soft.
Thus, concentrating *qi* is the means to achieve uprightness.

Upright nurturing without harm to the outside
is not to ‘hold fast to one’s will,
nor to vent one’s *qi’*—
it is like Zengzi’s moderation:
when moderation accumulates to its extreme,
it returns to subtlety—
thus upright nurturing is the means to achieve softness.
Therefore, the highest understanding of the Dao is fundamentally undivided."*

This is found in *Shilin Yanxia Fangyan*.

The Northern Song scholar Cheng Yi commented on Laozi:
*"The Dao that can be spoken of can guide conduct;
the name that can be named can establish discourse.
But the unspoken constant Dao,
the unnamed constant Name—
even sages dare not reveal these to others.
It is not that they conceal them in secrecy,
but that they cannot be revealed at all.

Thus, the sages of the West
set forth three vehicles of teaching,
twelve divisions of exposition,
and called it *doctrine*.
What was transmitted beyond doctrine
was the unspoken and unnamed.

The sages of China
took the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors as their ancestors,
established the rites of the Xia and Shang,
and codified poetry, history, rites, and music—
calling it the *Classics*.
Yet what they spoke of
was like the path beneath the footprints—
the unspoken and unnamed.

Thus, Laozi composed the Five Thousand Words
to show the world and guide posterity,
not retreating into obscurity for his own sake.
Hence, his opening words speak of the Dao that can be spoken of,
the Name that can be named—
all contained within the Five Thousand Words.
But what the thousand sages did not transmit
cannot be spoken of."*

He says again:
*"Heaven, Earth, and humanity share a single origin.
What makes Heaven Heaven, Earth Earth,
and humanity human
is fundamentally the same—
yet Heaven and Earth endure long,
while humanity does not. Why?

Heaven does not know it is Heaven;
Earth does not know it is Earth.
Yet once a person receives their form,
they claim it as ‘I’—
‘human, human,’ they say—
and because they believe life cannot be sustained without things,
they indulge in futile pursuits.
Because they believe their body cannot be cherished enough,
they toil over superficial concerns,
thickening life while hastening their ruin,
nurturing the body while ailing it—
that they do not perish early is fortunate indeed.

This is Laozi’s intent,
yet those who do not ponder it
mistake the Yellow-Lao school for fearing death
and seeking immortality—
how mistaken they are!"*

If a person has no life,
where would the Dao find its vessel?

Yet those who lose their life in the world
merely take their very life as a burden—
those who possess life are still deeply warned by Laozi,
yet they claim to seek longevity outside the Dao?
They have not pondered this.

Again it is said:
Among all transformations of things,
none surpasses death and life.
For one who follows the Dao,
transcending the bounds of life,
there is nothing else to attend to.

Does life truly come?
Does death truly go?
If life is truly coming,
then whence did I arise?
South or north?
East or west?
Above or below?
It cannot be spoken of with certainty—
yet to call it "truly coming," is that possible?

If death is truly departing,
then whither do I go?
Mind?
Things?
Humanity?
Heaven?
It cannot be spoken of with certainty—
yet to call it "truly departing," is that possible?

Thus, my life—
before, I do not know its origin;
after, I do not know its end.
Piercing through eternity, ever-present,
it is serene and boundless.

Only then do I clearly know:
I have never truly lived,
nor have I ever truly died.
Then what could be called the realm of death?

Again it is said:
The faults of the common folk are easy to dismiss,
but the flaws of the sages are hard to remove.
Pursuing desires harms nature,
choosing and rejecting unsettle the mind—
these are the errors of the common folk.
Their faults are great and visible,
so they are easy to dismiss.

To take enlightenment as an obstacle,
to see liberation as bondage—
these are the flaws of the sages.
Subtle and hard to discern,
so they are hard to remove.

When faults are overt and principles are subtle,
to see material ailments is clear,
but to see doctrinal afflictions is obscure.
Then, if principles obstruct and doctrines ail,
how can one exhaust their flaws?

To purify and remove the fundamental vision—
this is what is meant.

The fundamental vision is what the sage calls
"the singular perception."
If a person possesses this profound insight
yet fails to remove it,
that is bondage in liberation.

To purify and remove the fundamental vision,
yet to still hold onto the notion of purification—
this is enlightenment as an obstacle.

Again it is said:
The sage does not harm the people by nature,
yet can also make ghosts and spirits not harm humanity—
how so?

For the person in the Dao,
the Dao in the person,
is like fish in water,
water in the fish—
what need is there for distinctions of life and death?

When the sage governs the world with the Dao,
the people’s lives are tranquil,
thus their living is well-nurtured.
Their deaths are serene,
thus their dying is well-nurtured.
Serene and complete,
how could ghosts dare to be spectral or malevolent?

Life is as it is,
death is as it is—
then where is there still room for spirits to haunt or torment?

Only through constant virtue
can one save all without abandoning any,
save all things without abandoning any.
Virtue through action—
could it achieve such?
Only through non-accumulation
can one give to others while possessing more,
share with others while having abundance.
The application of fixed forms—
could it achieve such?

Extending this Dao to benefit the world
and deliver all beings,
what need is there for distinctions of Confucianism, Buddhism, or Daoism?

Gongzhuo Deng Su said:
I have examined the origins of Daoist teachings—
their source lies with the Yellow Emperor,
their flourishing with Laozi,
but their later branches grew strange and terrifying.
There were thirty-seven sects,
and nine hundred ninety-three texts.

All who ruled the world
must uphold this Dao.
Among its most extreme adherents were three emperors:
Qin’s First Emperor, Han’s Wu Emperor, and Tang’s Ming Emperor.
These three emperors
possessed talents surpassing others,
contemptuous of their age,
yet even the vastness of the six directions
could not satisfy their desires.
Thus, they harbored grand ambitions—
refining elixirs, flying talismans,
mixing with heterodox arts,
believing their methods could rival Heaven and Earth.
Yet in the end, their flying techniques
could not succeed,
and they brought ruin upon their own realms—
truly lamentable.

Still, when the Han High Emperor took the world,
Zhang Liang was his greatest aide,
and when he ruled,
he entrusted governance to Cao Shen—
the finest choice.
Zhang Liang’s Dao emulated the Red Pine Immortal,
while Cao Shen, in his residence,
avoided the main hall to dwell in the guest quarters—
thus, the arts of Daoism
were not without benefit for the world.

The Han High Emperor’s reliance on Shen and Liang
stemmed from the Dao’s foundation—
nothing more than clarity, tranquility, reverence, frugality, and non-action,
resting alongside the people.

But the First Emperor, Wu Emperor, and Ming Emperor
pursued only the superficial,
exhausting their efforts on trivial ends,
so delusions and falsehoods prevailed,
allowing their schemes to take root.
This is how governance and chaos,
virtue and folly,
differ so utterly,
beyond comparison.

When later branches spread wildly,
strange and monstrous phenomena emerged,
capable of misleading rulers
and bringing ruin to the world—
these were not the Dao of the Yellow Emperor or Laozi.

From *The Gongzhuo Collection*.
Yan Gushan Jiang Kuo said:
The Dao is elusive and hard to speak of.
What is called "Dao"
is merely a name given to what is not truly the Dao.

The Five Classics speak of it briefly,
while Laozi, Lie Yukou, and Zhuang Zhou speak of it in detail.
Though their approaches differ—
one concise, one elaborate—
both illuminate the essence of the Dao.
*On Inquiry into the Dao.*

Again it is said:
Someone asked: When Laozi wrote his book,
was it composed at the time or compiled later?
I replied: This cannot be known.

In my youth, at a collector’s library,
I saw an ancient-text *Laozi*.
Its words were largely the same as today’s,
but with minor differences.
Examining their meaning revealed unity,
yet the order differed from today’s chapters,
so I suspected later scholars had dissected it.

The Dao encompasses all things,
yet the Five Thousand Words record
only what can be spoken of as Dao.

Again, it departs and becomes **virtue**—yet this seems unlikely.

I replied: **Dao** and **virtue** are fundamentally the same, though their names differ. Why should this be impossible?

He said: How can this be so?

I have read the Five Classics and the Hundred Schools. Whenever they speak of **Dao** and **virtue**, they distinguish between greater and lesser, earlier and later—this cannot be generalized without examination.

I replied: Zhuang Zhou spoke of the one-sided scholar who divided the beauty of Heaven and Earth, dissecting the principles of all things, all stemming from the non-unity of **Dao** and **virtue**. He lamented that later scholars were thus unfortunate.

Do you also wish to follow this path?

He said: I wish to hear its meaning.

I said: **Dao** is what is found everywhere without limit; **virtue** is what one attains from it. **Dao** is the path all share, while **virtue** is what each attains for themselves.

Let me use water as an analogy: the vastness of lakes and seas differs from the water stored in a courtyard well, yet is it not still water? The torrent of rivers differs from the rush of ditches, yet is it not still water?

Water is like **Dao**—omnipresent, yet lakes, seas, wells, rivers, and ditches each manifest it differently. To say they are fundamentally the same yet named differently is undeniable.

For the scholar of **Dao**, to grasp it with the mind, to perceive it with the spirit, to balance and fulfill it until self-sufficient—then **virtue** is complete, and one stands firm.

To advance in **virtue** until it encompasses **Dao** is to return to the beginning.

Thus, **Dao** is not excessive compared to **virtue**; **Dao** is dispersed while **virtue** shines forth. **Virtue** is not deficient compared to **Dao**; when **virtue** is complete, **Dao** becomes hidden. Hence, the sage embodies **Dao** fully and perfectly, while the virtuous person illuminates **Dao** and fulfills **virtue**—this is their distinction.

He said: **Dao** is subtle and formless; can **virtue** be seen?

I said: **Dao** has no fixed shape, but **virtue** has completion and deficiency. What is complete and deficient is evident to the heart and mind—how could it not be seen?

To align with **Dao** is to have no **virtue** to name; to distinguish **virtue** is to have a name to discern. Thus it is said: **Dao** has no constant name, while **virtue** has a defined form.

When Laozi emerged, **Dao** and its methods were shifting. His teachings all clarified the ultimate and appropriate end—though his words varied, like a head with a tail, examining their essence reveals no contradiction.

*On Inquiry into Virtue.*

Again it is said:
What arises in the heart is inexhaustible; thus what is bestowed upon the body is endless.
Death and rebirth, life and death—
the beginning and end are like an unending cycle.

Laozi spoke of birth and death:
thirteen aspects of life,
thirteen aspects of death,
thirteen movements leading to death—
three threes make nine.
From the perspective of ten aspects,
only one escapes life and death.

What is this one? Perhaps it is the person who returns to the **Dao**.

The scholar who aspires to **Dao** can cultivate the self in anticipation of it,
straightforward in extension,
yielding in retreat—
perhaps this is how one may speak of it.

*On Inquiry into Fate.*

Again it is said:
Someone asked: Laozi, Lie Yukou, Zhuang Zhou, and Meng Ke all were ancient masters of **Dao**, yet their teachings sought to gain the trust of later generations. Why do they contradict each other so?

Laozi said: *"I have a great affliction—my very body."*
Lie Yukou said: *"Inner observation brings trust in the self."*
Zhuang Zhou said: *"My body is not mine."*
Meng Ke said: *"All things are complete within me; to reflect inwardly and be sincere—no greater joy exists."*

Some reject the body as an affliction, others value its completeness—how could they not contradict?

I replied: You have not thought deeply. You have grasped their words but not their intent.

The limbs, bones, organs, and viscera—all that constitutes the body—are called the *body*.
Sight, hearing, speech, expression, thought—these inherent faculties are also called the *body*.
Though the name *body* is the same, what constitutes it differs.

Some speak of the *body* as form, others as nature.
Laozi and Zhuang Zhou likely spoke of the *body* as form,
while Lie Yukou and Meng Ke likely spoke of it as nature.

Speaking of form, the limbs, bones, organs, and viscera—if they exist, they bring affliction; if they do not, there is no affliction. Thus, one must not allow them to exist.
Yet what is meant by "nonexistent" is not the annihilation of the body, but simply that movement, speech, and action are unseen.

Speaking of nature, sight, hearing, speech, expression, and thought—all encompassed by a single principle, all things are complete within. If one observes inwardly, it is sufficient.
High as Heaven, low as Earth—looking up and down, all is discerned within. Who is not complete within me? Who lacks anything in the body?

Thus, Laozi and Zhuang Zhou’s view of the body demands its nonexistence,
while Lie Yukou and Meng Ke’s view demands its observation.

*On Inquiry into the Body.*

Again it is said:
Someone asked: What is *xi* (息)?

I replied: It is the movement of yin and yang as left and right,
the ebb and flow of the child and parent,
like an unceasing wheel, an endless ring—
interacting with primordial *qi*, ceaseless day and night.
This is what Laozi and Lie Yukou called *chong qi* (the penetrating *qi*).

If you know how to guard *xi*, you know how to nurture *qi*.
If you know how to nurture *qi*, you know how to enter **Dao**.
If you know how to enter **Dao**, you embrace unity in meditation—
the result is the same.

Laozi said:
*"Continuous as if it exists,
yet used without exertion—
return to it and seek it,
and you will attain it."*

*On Inquiry into Breath.*

Again it is said:
Zhuang Zhou spoke of those who cultivate the form—
blowing and breathing like clay pots—
but this is merely their superficial practice.

When form and spirit are both refined,
it originates from inheriting the mother *qi*.

「Laozi said:
*"The mysterious female gate,*
*This is the root of heaven and earth.*
*The Way of immortality,*
*Originates from here."*

*On Inquiry into Qi.*

Again it is said:
Confucius said: *"Do not cling to thoughts, do not cling to self."*
Laozi said: *"When you reach the state of no-self,*
*What harm can come to you?"*
Bodhidharma said: *"Abandon eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind—*
*If one possesses birth,*
*They manifest as form and color externally,*
*And know thoughts internally.*
*Why must they be abandoned?"*

Indeed, the state of *wu* (無) is the convergence of all virtues,
the foundation of all dharma.
If a person can externally cease all distractions,
and inwardly merge with *wu*,
then they will align with the **Dao**.

Its essence is singular—
like what is called *zuòwàng* (坐忘),
or *xīqì miànbì* (息气面壁),
are these not divergent paths to the same end?

**Yan Gu** (嚴谷), courtesy name **Zhongchang** (仲長),
was from Sanqu (三衢).
He styled himself *Yan Gu Shanren* (嚴谷山人),
which was his self-chosen name.

He cultivated simplicity in his garden retreat,
teaching students through scriptural learning.
During the Shaoxing era (紹興間),
high-ranking officials recommended him to the court.
After being summoned for an audience, he declined with force
and returned to his hometown.
The scholarly community held him in high regard.

His biography is also recorded in *The Collected Works of Yan Gu* (《嚴谷集》).*

Yang Wen’an Gong, during the Shaoxing era, served as a *zhuō* (橐) attendant at the imperial lectern and presented a treatise titled *"On Presenting Commentaries on the Laozi."* He wrote:

*"The Laozi states: I possess three treasures. Cherish them and uphold them: the first is *cí* (慈, compassion), the second is *jiǎn* (俭, frugality), the third is *bù gǎn wéi tiānxià xiān* (不敢为天下先, not daring to lead the world).*

*Compassion makes one courageous; frugality makes one abundant. Not daring to lead the world first allows one to become a vessel of virtue and longevity.*

*I have heard that seeking the Dao through the reach of cleverness and intelligence only exhausts the mind, making the Dao ever more obscure. Abandoning cleverness and intelligence to seek it in daily life, however, is simple and direct—then the Dao may perhaps be glimpsed.*

*To rely on cleverness and exhaust intelligence is the folly of those with shallow understanding. Using such means to respond to the world, there remains doubtless some lingering attachment or unresolved emotion. Thus, if one seeks compassion, they risk indulgence; if frugality, they risk meanness; if not daring to lead, they risk cowardice. This is why the mind labors, yet the Dao remains obscured—it is clear.*

*But those who embody the Dao are otherwise. Their innate wisdom is effortlessly complete, as if born of Heaven. When things press upon them, there is no room for contrivance—they respond naturally as they encounter them. Without malice, they are compassionate; without desire, they are frugal; without contention, they do not dare lead the world first. Their daily conduct is simple yet perfectly aligned. This is not achieved by cleverness or intelligence alone—only the most sagely of rulers could attain it.*

*The *Yijing*’s *Qian* (乾) hexagram says: ‘Embodying *rén* (仁, benevolence) suffices to nurture the people.’ The *Kun* (坤) hexagram says: ‘Though *Kun* is supremely yielding, its action is firm—thus, those who attain *rén* also possess courage.’ Hence, it is said: *‘Compassion makes one courageous.’*

*The *Jié* (节) hexagram says: ‘Moderation through rites and institutions does not deplete resources nor harm the people.’ Thus, it aligns with the idea of *‘frugality making one abundant.’*

*The *Qiān* (谦) hexagram says: ‘Humility brings radiance; lowliness is unassailable.’ This reflects the principle of *‘one who does not lead the world first attains virtue and longevity.’*

*The teachings of the *Daodejing* and the *Yijing* resonate like matching seals. The Sage-Emperor does not fail to be an emperor; the Sage-King does not fail to be a king. Their boundless benevolence cherishes life, their martial virtue refrains from killing—is this not compassion? Their thatched huts and earthen steps, their coarse garments and humble attire—is this not frugality? Their lack of arrogance or self-praise, their avoidance of rivalry or scheming—is this not not daring to lead the world first?

*Even down to the Han dynasty’s broad benevolence and magnanimity—like Emperor Gaozu, nearly compassionate in governing through virtue; Emperor Wen, nearly frugal in ruling with gentle principles; Emperor Guangwu, nearly not daring to lead—these rulers treasured compassion and courage, frugality and abundance, humility and longevity. Though they fell short of the Two Sovereigns and Three Kings, even the Han emperors could be emulated and praised.*

*Furthermore, the Daoist tradition traces its origins far back—from the Yellow Emperor’s school, through Laozi in the Zhou, to Lie Yukou and Zhuangzi during the Warring States. By the Qin and Han, it became known as the Yellow-Lao learning. Its essence lies in *xūwú zìrán* (虚无自然, emptiness and spontaneity), its practice in *qīngjìng dànpō* (清静澹泊, clarity and tranquility). Its core is self-cultivation, its extensions extend to governing the world. Since ancient times, it has coexisted with the Dao of Yao, Shun, Zhou, and Confucius without contradiction.*

*As for the *Fó Tú* (浮屠, Buddhist) school, it originated in the West and entered China only during the Han. When Huo Qubing defeated the Xiongnu, he captured a sacrificial golden figure from the *Xiutu* king. Yan Shigu noted that this was an early Buddhist statue. Emperor Ming dreamed of a golden figure descending from the sky, and Fu Yi identified it as a sage from the West. He dispatched envoys to *Tianzhu* (天竺, India) to investigate, and thus Buddhist teachings began to spread. Examining its origins, its foundations differ entirely from Daoist learning, and its paths diverge. Why not examine the *Daodejing*’s five thousand characters? Its language is subtle, its intent profound, its text simple yet rigorous, its meaning vast and authoritative—it nearly complements the Six Classics, unlike ice and charcoal or wedge and socket, which cannot intermingle. Later scholars casually lump them together as ‘Buddhist-Laoist’—how strange!*

*This is also recorded in *The Yushishi Collection* (《芸室集》).*

*During his time in the *Qián Dì* (潜邸, prince’s residence), Prince Guang (光庙) consulted Program Wenjian Gong Dachang, who served as a palace official. The prince sought his writings on *Yi-Lao Unified Speeches* (*Yi-Lao Tongyan*), and Dachang submitted them in the form of a *gēzi* (割子, scroll). Its essence reads:*

*‘Why is Laozi so revered? He grasped the pivotal principles and governed the world through the Dao—this is his strength. Though he valued the *wu* (无, nonexistent) over the *yǒu* (有, existent) and rarely spoke of worldly affairs, this was not a flaw. Thus, the Han Emperor Wen, who followed Laozi, governed with a clear mind, few desires, and profound simplicity—his rule was not one of inaction. This is why the Han dynasty flourished with enduring stability: it grasped the essence and utilized his strengths.*

*Yet by the Western Jin, though they heard Laozi’s words, they took *wuwei* (无为, non-action) as the principle of governance without understanding *how* to practice non-action. They believed that loosening laws, doing nothing, and passively waiting would suffice—until the state’s foundations collapsed and chaos ensued. Thus, Wang Tong remarked: ‘The Jin dynasty’s adherence to emptiness led to its ruin—this was not Laozi’s fault. They failed to grasp the core and misunderstood his strengths.’*

*My humble hope is that Your Highness adopts the pivotal principles of Laozi and takes the Western Han as a model, learning from the Jin’s misguided inaction as a warning. Then, the refined words and profound Dao of Laozi will be fully realized in Your Highness’s governance.’*

The author further composed *The Hidden Scaffolding of Flourishing Virtue* (《潜藩盛德录_), within which one passage states:

*"In my past discussions with Your Highness, whenever the topic turned to the Great Dao, I would often cite passages from the* **Yijing·Xi** (*《易·系》*—the "Appendices" of the *Yijing*), pairing the* **Daoqi** (*道器*—the interplay of Dao and its manifestation) *with Confucius’ words on* **xiàxué shàngdá** (*下学上达*—mastering the lower to attain the higher), and would interweave them in speech.*

*"Indeed, the interplay of Dao and its manifestation can be understood through the analogy of* **learning from the lower to attain the higher** (*学乎下可以达乎上*), just as firewood generates flames—this is the Dao of the higher form relying upon the instrument of the lower form. Though the wood may be coarse, its essence and brilliance can still blaze and ascend. The* **Six Classics** (*六经*) *and the* **Mengzi’s teachings** (*论孟*) *speak much of* **instruments** (*器*) *and little of the* **Dao** (*道*), *as if they were storing wood merely to produce flames. The works of Laozi and Zhuangzi, however, speak more of* **non-being** (*无*) *than of* **being** (*有*), *as if to say: ‘The Six Classics have already spoken extensively of the wood; there is no need to elaborate further.’*

*"The Confucian scholars, in their pursuit of the Dao, have the Six Classics. It would seem they have no need to draw from Laozi and Zhuangzi. Yet their writings are subtle and profound, aiding in the revelation of hidden aspects of the Dao, and are particularly refined and essential. If one could broadly incorporate them, the benefit would be immense—provided one does not, like the Jin scholars, speak of emptiness in vain, and claim that abandoning rites, music, punishments, and governance would allow the world to govern itself.*

*Has there ever been fire that could blaze without wood?*

*"Moreover, it is said: ‘Nowadays, Daoists who follow Laozi’s teachings abandon the fundamental Dao and speak only of prescriptions, elixirs, and prayers for warding off misfortune or invoking blessings—how far they have strayed from the original intent! Only Bai Juyi’s poetry clearly articulates its truth, stating:*

*‘How much more so the* **Yuan Yuan Huangdi** *(元元皇帝—Primordial Sovereign, i.e., Laozi) *of the* **Five Thousand Words** *(五千言),
Does not speak of elixirs,
Does not speak of immortals,
Does not speak of ascending to the Azure Sky in broad daylight.’*

*The* **Primordial Sovereign** *(元元皇帝) *is none other than Laozi. The Daoist tradition venerates Laozi as its founder, yet in the* **Eighty-One Chapters** *(八十一章) *of his work, beyond the themes of* **Qingjing Guayu** *(清静寡欲—serene stillness and few desires), there is not a single word on alchemy, immortals, or prayers for warding off misfortune and invoking blessings. How can one arbitrarily claim there are prescriptions, elixirs, or immortals, and speak of prayers and incantations?’*

*"Your Highness graciously approves my words, and upon reciting Bai Juyi’s full verse, you further praise his understanding of Laozi, recognizing its profundity and subtlety. I have also included this in my own collection.*

*"It is further said: ‘The world reveres Laozi yet doubts that his teachings surpass the* **Five Three Six Classics** *(五三六经—likely a reference to the* **Five Classics** *and* **Three Commentaries** *of the Six Classics), or scoffs at his emptiness and uselessness—all failing to truly comprehend Laozi.*

*‘Yet Laozi’s lofty aspirations are indeed present. His discussions of the Dao’s mysteries do not dwell on the Dao itself, but exhaustively reveal its subtleties. He employs instruments to manifest the Dao, yet transcends mere attachment to being. The Six Classics focus on recording deeds and events, without delving deeply into their meanings. This book truly exhausts its explanations, thus elaborating on what the* **Mengzi** *(论孟) *strives to clarify. Therefore, it is worthy to stand alongside the Six Classics.’*

*"As seen in* **The Harmonized Speeches on the Yijing and Laozi** *(《易老通言》).*

*"Shen Zongzhong asked Master Zhu Xi (晦庵先生朱文公): ‘There are those who wish to observe Your Highness’ disdain—how is this understood?’"*

Master Zhu said: *"This ‘edge’ and ‘border’ are like boundaries that resemble each other—this refers to the point where they meet. People have always interpreted ‘constant’ and ‘non-constant’ as a duality, but it is better to see ‘constant’ as the absence of desire and ‘non-constant’ as the presence of desire.*

*He was further asked: ‘How should “The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao” be understood?’*
Master Zhu said: *"The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao; the name that can be named is not the eternal name."*

*He was further asked: ‘What is the meaning of “mysterious”?’*
Master Zhu said: *"‘Mysterious’ is to probe the depths until it reaches a pitch so profound that it is utterly dark—this is where all subtleties converge."*

*Zhang Yi asked about the meaning of ‘loading the spirit, embracing unity, and preventing separation.’*
Master Zhu said: *"The ‘spirit’ (魂) is two, the ‘vital breath’ (魄) is one. One is water, two is fire. Fire embraces water, and the spirit loads the vital breath—this is the principle of movement guarding stillness."*

Master Zhu said: *"‘Hoarding much will inevitably lead to great loss’—Laozi spoke truly well on this."*

*Chen Zhongheng asked about the* **Book of Zhou** *(《周书》): ‘“Those who would subvert it must first aid it; those who would take it must first give it.” Yet the* **Book of Zhou** *lacks this. Why?’*
Master Zhu said: *"This is precisely what Laozi condensed into a few phrases. In the Zhou era, such texts existed, and since Laozi was the Keeper of Archives, he had ample exposure to them—this is why Confucius visited Zhou to inquire about rites and such."*

*Huang Yigang asked: ‘Original Rang seems to have studied Laozi.’*
Master Zhu said: *"He does not resemble Laozi. Laozi was not like that at all."*
Zhuang Zhong said: *"He seems like Zhuangzi."*
Master Zhu said: *"That is correct. Even in Confucius’ time, such people already existed."*
Zhuang Zhong said: *"Though Zhuangzi took Laozi as his master, Laozi’s teachings were still meant to engage with the world, whereas Zhuangzi was not so."*
Master Zhu said: *"Zhuangzi’s words are broader and more distant, yet also more vacuous—he strayed from Laozi’s intent. If Laozi were alive to hear this, he would not approve."*

*Someone asked: ‘Laozi’s Dao was effectively applied by Cao Can and Emperor Wen of Han, yet why did figures like Wang Dao and Xie An fail to achieve the same?’*
Master Zhu said: *"Wang Dao and Xie An never truly grasped Laozi’s profundities."*

Master Zhu said: *"Han Emperor Wen and Cao Can indeed applied Laozi’s principles, but they only understood his superficial aspects—merely accommodating and following conventions without deeper engagement."*

*Guo Deyuan asked: ‘Laozi said, “Ritual, though thin in loyalty and trustworthiness, is the root of disorder.” Yet Confucius inquired about ritual from him. Why?’*
Master Zhu said: *"He understood the complexities of ritual."*

*Initially, I suspected there were two Lao Dan, and Cheng Hao also seemed to think so. Now, upon closer examination, this is not the case. Since he served as Keeper of Archives, he naturally comprehended ritual well, which is why he spoke so aptly with Confucius. He also said that these rites could be dispensed with if unnecessary—almost as if the Sage’s use of ritual was overly burdensome, hence his words. The passage in* **The Rites’ Evolution** *(《礼运》) on ‘planning to use it leads to its rise, and from this, wars emerge’ carries this same meaning."*

Master Zhu said: *"Laozi’s methods were austere and frugal, unwilling to exert the spirit. He initially taught ‘tranquil stillness and non-action,’ yet also incorporated longevity and immortality. Later, his teachings focused solely on longevity and immortality, reducing him to a mere shamanistic practitioner—obsessed with warding off misfortune and praying for blessings. This marks two distinct shifts in his thought."*

*He also said: ‘Bo Yi somewhat resembled Laozi.’*
*He also said: ‘Zhang Liang was deeply versed in Laozi’s teachings, while Cao Can learned them superficially without application.’*
*He also said: ‘Among figures after Mencius, only Zhang Liang and Zhuge Liang stand out. Zhang Liang’s studies stemmed from Huang-Lao, but compared to Wang Anshi, his approach was less meticulous.’*
*He also said: ‘Yang Xiong’s* **Tai Xuan** *(《太玄》) *originated from Zhuang-Lao, evident in its stillness and emptiness.’*
*He also said: ‘Though Wen Zhong had ambitions for the world and understood the institutions of the Three Dynasties, compared to Zhang Liang and Wei Qing, he possessed somewhat greater capability. Yet tracing his theoretical roots, they still stem from Zhuang-Lao.’*

*Someone asked: ‘Though scholars of the Jin and Song dynasties often spoke of Zhuang-Lao, perhaps they did not fully grasp their true essence.’*
Master Zhu said: *"Those scholars merely borrowed their language to justify abandoning ritual and law. Given their corrupt and chaotic minds, how could they truly comprehend Zhuang-Lao’s intent?"*

Master Zhu said: *"Kang You once claimed, ‘Laozi grasped the essence of the* **Yijing** *(《易》), and Mencius its application.’ This is incorrect. Laozi had his own essence and application, and Mencius had his own. ‘To take, one must first give’—this is Laozi’s essence and application. ‘Cultivating the heart-mind and nurturing the nature, expanding the four beginnings’—this is Mencius’ essence and application."*

*He also said: ‘Kang You’s studies resembled Laozi’s, yet he sought only ease and comfort, untroubled by others. Zhang Zifang was the same—while others were in turmoil, he remained at peace in seclusion.’*

*Zhang Wanjie then asked about the preface to* **Striking the Millet Field** *(《击壤集》), which speaks of observing the Dao through the Dao. Is this truly without flaw?*
Master Zhu said: *"To call it flawless is incorrect, yet to call it flawed is also incorrect. It expresses the same intent—like observing the world through the world. This perspective originates from Laozi."*

*Chen Qi asked: ‘Mencius’ morning qi is exceedingly subtle—how could he cultivate it so completely?’*
Master Zhu said: *"He failed to preserve the night qi, which was ruined by the activities of dawn and day—what is called ‘good and evil being nearly indistinguishable from others.’"*

「Zhang Wanjie then cited Laozi’s words: *“In governing people and harmonizing with Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality. Only frugality is called ‘early return.’ Early return is called ‘heavily accumulating virtue/power.’ Heavily accumulating virtue/power means nothing cannot be overcome, and its essence aligns closely with Mencius’ intent. Yet its focus lies in nurturing the spirit—its meaning is inherently good. Mencius’ morning qi is exceedingly subtle, but the cultivation of it is no different: it is the practice of maintaining this heart in daily life.”*

Li Jingzi asked: *“Is there truth in the claims of immortals and transcendent beings?”*
Master Zhu said: *“Who would say there is none? There is indeed such possibility, but their practice is exceedingly difficult. Unless one abandons all worldly affairs, one cannot achieve that level of cultivation.”*

Cai Jitong remarked: *“Daoists speak of Laozi and Zhuangzi as supreme, yet they fail to embody their teachings.”*
Master Zhu said: *“Nowadays, scholars read countless books, yet their understanding of their own principles remains shallow. How then could they have the leisure to truly grasp the Dao of Laozi and Zhuangzi?”*
Cai said: *“Liezi’s teachings are also commendable.”*
Master Zhu replied: *“Liezi’s words are indeed admirable, but they are weak in conviction—unlike Zhuangzi.”*
Asked how Laozi compares, he said: *“Laozi’s words are even deeper and more profound.”*

Master Zhu continued: *“The early Buddhist teachings merely borrowed the language of Laozi and Zhuangzi. For instance, texts like those of the Far Master (远法师) employ their ideas in fragments, but their spoken teachings are ineffective. Only with the arrival of Dharma (法) did they begin instructing people to cultivate themselves directly—thus, Zen (禅) emerged later. All this is recorded in* **Master Zhu’s Collected Sayings** *(《文公语录》).*

Lu Jiuxian of Xiangshan (象山陆九渊) stated: *“Heterodox teachings originated not from Confucius. Today’s reckless scholars point only to Buddhism and Daoism as heterodox, yet in Confucius’ time, China knew nothing of Buddhism, and though Laozi existed, his teachings were not yet widely proclaimed. The Master’s condemnation of empty talk in* **The Analects** *(《论》) and* **Mencius** *(《孟》) is evident, but he never explicitly rejected Laozi’s words—thus, it is clear that ‘heterodox’ does not refer solely to Buddhism and Daoism.”*
(Recorded in *Lu Jiuxian’s Collected Works* 《象山集》.)

Liu Yizhi of Zhouxi (苕溪刘一止行简) said: *“I ponder the affairs of the world: what aligns with human sentiment below, with Heaven’s intent above, and with the Great Dao in the middle, is but one principle—* **‘public and self’** *(公而己). Laozi declared: ‘Tolerance is public, publicness is magnanimity, magnanimity is Heaven’s, Heaven’s is the Dao.’ These are but one, inseparable. Tolerance cannot achieve publicness without magnanimity; the term ‘public and magnanimous’ (王公) refers to one who tolerates yet remains public. The term ‘public and expansive’ (王训) refers to one who is public yet possesses greatness. Thus, publicness must share virtue/power with magnanimity, and magnanimity must share the Dao with Heaven. This is the ultimate principle of the world.”*
(Recorded in *Liu Yizhi’s Collected Works* 《苕溪集》.)

Zheng Bojun of Yongjia (永嘉郑伯熊景望) said: *“Master Zhu governed the Yellow Old (黄老) teachings, while Cao Zang (曹相国) applied them in Qi (齐) and claimed to govern it. Yet Confucians often disparage Yellow Old teachings—why is this? I once secluded myself all day, sat in silence, and restrained my actions. I minimized tastes, and my heart became tranquil, my qi even—no illness could invade. I preserved what was lacking and dispersed what was excessive, sought nothing in vain, and worried not beyond measure. Yet the aged and frail find ease in quietude. I considered this principle and found it applicable to all things under Heaven—why single out Qi, a mere hundred-li territory? Confucius and Mencius’ teachings could not be more correct, yet why do they disparage Yellow Old teachings? Indeed, the Daoists’ pursuit of purity (清净) often veers into falsehood (诞).”*
(Recorded in *Mr. Zheng’s Steady Words* 《郑先生戆语》.)

Liu Qingshui said: *“Laozi’s words on Dao and virtue/power were spoken in response to Guan Ling’s (关令) request, yet he composed them without hesitation, and the text was written down as is. He never divided it into ninety-nine chapters. Later scholars split it into two volumes—Upper and Lower—mirroring the duality of yin and yang, and eighty-one chapters—nine times nine—corresponding to the extreme number of the sun.”*
(From the preface to *A General Discussion on the Dao and Virtue Text* 《道德经通论序》.)

Huang Maocai stated: *“Though Dao and virtue/power bear two names, they are inseparable in function. Today’s scholars mistakenly divide the Upper Text as Dao and the Lower Text as virtue/power—this is far from the author’s original intent.”*
He further said: *“The* **I Ching** *(《易》) contains sixty-four hexagrams, eight times eight. Laozi’s text has eighty-one chapters, nine times nine. Laozi’s work complements the* **I Ching** *(《易》) like a mirror; later, Yang Xiong (杨子云) composed* **The Great Mysterious** *(《太玄》) to align with the* **I Ching** *(《易》), also with eighty-one verses—clearly inspired by this.”*
(From *Commentary on the Text* 《经注》.)

Lin Dong said: *“The teachings of the Master and Laozi illuminate each other. The Master used* **‘Ren, Yi, Li, and Le’** *(仁义礼乐) as the means to govern the world, while Laozi employed* **‘emptiness, nothingness, and quietude’** *(虚无恬淡) to reveal the origin of the Great Dao. Ultimately,* **‘Ren, Yi, Li, and Le’** *emerge not from the Great Dao—from where then? And* **‘emptiness, nothingness, and quietude’** *are the very essence of the Great Dao. Yet later generations failed to apply Laozi’s teachings properly, often emphasizing only emptiness and quietude to the point of neglecting duties, thereby burdening Laozi’s legacy.”*
Moreover, he said: *“As for the Daoist principle of* **‘the subtle Dao-heart’** *(道心) and* **‘governing without action’** *(无为而治), our Confucian tradition has never rejected it. Laozi’s* **‘three treasures’** *(三宝)—one is compassion (慈), two is frugality (俭), three is not daring to act before Heaven and Earth (不敢为天下先)—his method of aiding rulers through the Dao, without relying on military might to dominate the world, is something our Confucian tradition has also never rejected.”*
Thus, he concluded: *“If we extend this reasoning, the Great Dao and the Dao are one and the same—only differing in priority and sequence. They mutually illuminate each other, both crafted to address the world’s woes. Some claim Laozi abandoned* **‘Ren’** *and rejected* **‘Yi’** *, that* **‘Li’** *is the origin of disorder—this is not at odds with the Master’s teachings. Indeed, elevating the Dao’s source, the Master acknowledged that* **‘Ren, Yi, Li, and Le’** *can govern the world, but it is superior to govern through the Dao, allowing people to forget themselves within it.”*

The *Daodejing* states:

*"As seen in the* **Jingjie Fati***. Liu Shili, who styled himself Zhenjingzi, a man of the Shaoxi era, composed the* **Daodejing Jiejie** *in sixteen chapters. Here, we take five of them.*

*'The profundity beyond profundity' refers to the natural origin of the primordial source. This is the gateway to all marvels—first discussing the Dao, then Heaven and Earth, and finally human nature. It is exhaustive. Scholars must ponder and grasp this silently.*

*'The Mysterious Female'*—*‘profound’* is yang, *‘female’* is yin. The ‘gate’ is the threshold where the two qi intermingle, as in the previous chapter: ‘the gateway to all marvels,’ or as the* **Analects** *say: ‘Who can exit without passing through the door? Why not follow this Way?’*

*Do not rigidly interpret ‘the Mysterious Female’ as the nasal passages.*

*‘The root of Heaven and Earth’*—*Laozi’s words imply that before Heaven and Earth existed, there was the primal qi, which is called the root of Heaven and Earth.*

*‘When full, it must become empty.’* *Beware of excess.*
*‘When sharp, it must become blunt.’* *Beware of aggression.*
*‘Gold and jade must be burdened.’* *Beware of greed.*
*‘Wealth and honor must lead to licentiousness.’* *Beware of arrogance.*
*‘When achievement and fame are complete, danger follows.’* *Beware of not knowing when to stop.*

*Laozi’s words are profound, meant to save people—not to say that those who abandon worldly affairs and retreat to mountains and forests can enter the Dao. Even amid wealth, honor, and fame, one may diligently practice it.*

*‘When stretched, it must contract; when strong, it must weaken; when exalted, it must decline; when given, it must be taken.’* *This is the natural principle of things—what is called subtle clarity.*

*‘Subtle clarity’*—*the refined and luminous, evident and verifiable.*

*Some interpret this through the lens of stratagem, but the Dao of Heaven benefits without harming. Is this not so?*

*Some say Confucius taught ‘responding to enmity with rectitude,’ yet here it says ‘responding with virtue.’ Why the difference?*

*Yet Laozi teaches that one should only cultivate softness and weakness, aligning with Heaven without contention, thus averting Heaven’s punishments and distant calamities. If one responds to enmity with rectitude, how can enmity cease?*

*Confucius’ words were spoken in response to his times, but responding with virtue is superior.*

*As the reclusive scholar Xie Shouhao observed:*
*The* **Daodejing** *was examined by Tang official Fu Yi, who compared numerous editions. The* **Xiang Yu Concubine Edition** *was unearthed in Pengcheng during the fifth year of Qi Emperor Wu’s reign (564 CE), when a tomb of Xiang Yu’s concubine was opened, and the text was found. The* **Anqiu Wangzhi Edition** *was obtained by Daoist Ge Xuan during the Taihe era of the Wei dynasty. The* **Hexiang Zhangren Edition** *was transmitted by the recluse Chou Yue of Qi.*

*The Three Family Editions total 5,722 characters, matching the* **Yu Lao** *in* **Hanfeizi***. Additionally, there is an* **Official Edition of Luoyang** *with 5,635 characters, Wang Bi’s Edition with 5,683 or 5,610 characters, and the* **Hexiang Gong Edition** *with 5,355 or 5,590 characters. The commentaries of these schools vary in length, but over time, each has been transmitted with trust, sometimes cross-referenced with other editions, leading to discrepancies.*

*As Sima Qian recorded in the* **Shiji***: ‘Laozi wrote a book on the meaning of Dao and virtue, with over five thousand words—though not reaching six thousand, it is still over five thousand.’*

*The Daoist tradition claims Laozi’s text consists of five thousand words, likely referring to its entirety.*

*See the* **Laojun Shilu***.*

*The* **Collected Commentaries on the Authentic Daodejing** *concludes here.*
