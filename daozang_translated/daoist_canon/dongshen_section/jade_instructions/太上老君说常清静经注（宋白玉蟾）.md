### *Annotations on the Scripture of Purity and Tranquility* [Preface]

**The Profound Origins of the Great Dao in the Sacred Records of Laozi**

The *Scripture of the Divine Empyrean* states: The wondrously ineffable Heavenly Thearch gives birth to the Three Qi and Three Treasures, the Heavenly Lords—
the Heavenly Treasure Lord of Mysterious Qi,
the Numinous Treasure Lord of Primordial Qi,
and the Divine Treasure Lord of Original Qi—
who are the Three Pure Ones.
The Jade Thearch is their ancestor, abiding in the primordial void of the Great Empyrean.

It further states: The Primordial Beginning descends to transform into the Great Prime of the Jade Palace, dwelling in the Purple Jade Celestial Palace, known as the Great Thearch of the Northern Culmen.
The Northern Culmen is the fifth transformation of the Primordial Beginning.
At the dawn of the *Red Clarity’s Unfolding Chart*, he became the Divine Duke of Supreme Purity;
after the *Inaugural Sovereignty*, he became the Great Thearch of the Northern Darkness.
Having accomplished his work of pacification, he resides in the Purple Tenuity Court of the Central Heaven, steadfast and unmoving, called the Celestial Culmen.
At times, he transforms into a star, becoming the Heavenly August Thearch;
in the teachings, he is called the Supreme Lord Lao;
in heaven, he is the sovereign of all heavens;
descending to the world, he is the teacher of a hundred kings.

The *Chart of Primordial Chaos* states: During the era of the first Three Sovereigns, his transformation was called the Heavenly Master of Myriad Methods.
Some say the Heavenly Master of Penetrating Mystery, or the Great Master of the Mysterious Center.
During the middle Three Sovereigns, his transformation was called Master Pangu, also known as the Great Master of Ancient Existence.
During the reign of the Heavenly Sovereign Fuxi, his transformation was called Master Yuhua.
Some say during the era of Nüwa, his transformation was called Master Yumi.
During the era of the Earthly Sovereign Shennong, his transformation was called Master Dacheng.
During the era of the Human Sovereign, the Yellow Emperor, his transformation was called Master Guangcheng.
During the era of Shaohao, his transformation was called Master Suiying.
During the era of Zhuanxu, his transformation was called Master Chijing.
During the era of Emperor Ku, his transformation was called Master Lutu.
During the era of Emperor Yao, his transformation was called Master Wucheng.
During the era of Emperor Shun, his transformation was called Master Yinshou.
During the era of Yu of Xia, his transformation was called Master Zhenxing.
During the era of Tang of Shang, his transformation was called Master Xize.

Though the Supreme Lord Lao transformed across successive ages, he had no record of mortal birth.
Until the reign of the eighteenth king of Shang, Yang Jia, he divided his spirit and transformed his qi, entrusting his embryo to the Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden.
After eighty-one years, in the gengchen year of the twenty-second king, Wuding, on the fifteenth day of the first month at the hour of mao, he was born in Quren Village, Lai District, Ku County of Chu.
His surname was Li, given name Er, style Boyang, and posthumous name Dan.

During the reign of King Wu of Zhou, he served as the Archivist of the Royal Archives, later becoming the Historian Beneath the Pillars.
In the twenty-third year of the fifth king, King Zhao, he passed through the Hangu Pass, where he instructed the Pass Prefect Yin Xi.

In the twenty-fifth year [of King Zhao], he descended to the Green Ram Market in Shu, where he met Yin Xi, and together they crossed the Flowing Sands. By the reign of King Mu, he returned to the Central Lands. In the twenty-first year of King Ling, the gengxu year, Confucius was born. In the seventeenth year of the twenty-seventh king, King Jing, the wuxu year, Confucius inquired of the rites from Lord Lao, and upon retiring, sighed of him as "like a dragon." In the forty-first year of King Jing, the renshu year, Confucius passed away. In the second year of the thirty-fifth king, King Lie, the dingwei year, he passed through Qin, where Duke Xian of Qin inquired of him regarding the reckoning of time, after which he departed through the Sanyuan Pass. In the eighth year of King Xian, the gengshen year, he moved east. In the ninth year of the thirty-eighth king, King Nan, the yimao year, he again departed through the Sanyuan Pass and ascended to Kunlun in flight.

During the Qin dynasty, he descended to the banks of the Shan River, where he was known as the Venerable Man by the River, or the River Master, and transmitted the Dao to Anqi Sheng. Emperor Wen of the Former Han favored the teachings of Laozi and dispatched envoys to summon and inquire of him. The River Master said: "The Dao is revered, and virtue is noble—these cannot be questioned from afar." The emperor then personally journeyed to him.

The Emperor said: "Under all heaven, none is not the king’s land; within the bounds of the earth, none is not the king’s subject. Within the realm there are Four Great Ones, and the king is one among them. Though you possess the Dao, you remain my subject. If you cannot submit, how can you be exalted? With but a word from me, I can make the poor rich and the lowly noble."

In an instant, the Venerable Man clapped his hands and leapt into a seated posture, rising gently into the void like a cloud ascending, hovering over a hundred *zhang* above the earth before coming to rest in the boundless emptiness. After a long while, he bowed slightly and replied: "Now I ascend not to heaven, am not burdened by men, and do not dwell upon the earth—what subject am I to you? How then can Your Majesty make me rich or poor, noble or base?"

The Emperor then understood and recognized him as a divine being. He alighted from his carriage and prostrated himself in reverence, offering his apologies. The Venerable Man bestowed upon him the essential teachings of the *Dao* and *Virtue* in two scriptures.

During the reign of Emperor Cheng, he descended to the springs of Quyang and transmitted the *Scripture of Supreme Peace* to Yu Ji. In the time of Emperor Zhang of the Han, he imparted to Yu Ji the *One Hundred and Eighty Great Precepts*. Under Emperor An, he revealed to Liu Tu the *New Code of Sin and Fortune*. During the reign of Emperor Shun, he descended to confer upon the Celestial Master the *Catalogue of the Three Caverns*. In the era of Emperor Huan, he descended upon Mount Tiantai and bestowed upon Ge Xiaoxian the various scriptures of *Highest Clarity*, *Numinous Treasure*, and *Great Cavern*. In the reign of Emperor Ming of Wei, he descended upon Mount Song and transmitted to the Celestial Master Kou Qianzhi the *New Code of Talismans and Registers*. During the reign of Emperor Gaozu of the Great Tang, he descended upon Yangjiao Mountain and spoke to Ji Shanxing, instructing him to receive the Mandate Talisman. In the first year of the Tianbao era of Emperor Ming, he descended at the Vermilion Phoenix Gate, and the Emperor personally received him at the Xingqing Palace. He also descended to speak with Tian Tongxiu, revealing the *Golden Casket of Numinous Talismans* hidden at the Hangu Pass. Further, he descended to instruct Wang Yuanyi in the *Wondrous Treasure of True Talismans*.

In the second year of the Zhenghe era of the Song, he descended upon the Huayang Grotto-Heaven and transmitted to Master Liang the *Extended Sentences of the Heavenly Child Scripture for Protecting Life*. It is also said: "The Venerable Lord appears in every age, transforming and teaching before the kalpas of dust, enduring beyond the infinite, now hidden, now manifest—his transformations are boundless. He acts without contrivance, abiding in spontaneity, eternally enduring. He silently upholds the imperial order, profound beyond profundity. His universal deliverance of heaven and humanity cannot be fully recounted."

Master Chongzhen said: "Regarding the principles of nurturing life and cultivating nature, the essential method lies in preserving the Three and embracing the One. The Three are essence, *qi*, and spirit—these are called the Three Treasures."

The Old Man of Xiangchuan said: "Essence generates *qi*, *qi* generates spirit. These govern the flourishing and defense of the body—nothing is greater than this, for they are the true foundation of cultivation."

*The Diagram of the Three Treasures of the Primordial Origin*
Tan Jingsheng said: "To preserve the Three and embrace the One is to refine essence into *qi*, refine *qi* into spirit, and refine spirit to merge with the Dao, penetrating the wondrous spontaneity of nature."

The scripture states: "Heaven has Three Treasures: the sun, moon, and stars. Humans have Three Treasures: essence, *qi*, and spirit. The spirit of the heart manifests in the eyes as sight; the essence of the kidneys manifests in the ears as hearing; the ethereal soul of the spleen manifests in the nose as smell; the corporeal soul of the gallbladder manifests in the mouth as speech. When one spirit moves, all spirits move; when one aperture opens, all nine apertures open. If one gate is securely locked, all gates are firm—turning the body, the true path becomes effortless."

*The Diagram of Inner Observation for the Initial Realization of Stillness and Stability*
*The Diagram of the Great Way of the Golden Elixir*
Bai Yuchan said: "The heart without a heart has no form; within the formless, nurture the numinous infant. When the study of immortality reaches the state of the infant, the moon shines bright in the cold pool’s stillness."

*Transmission of Scriptures and Verification of the Dao*
The Immortal Ge Xuan said: "I obtained this Dao after reciting the scripture ten thousand times. This scripture is practiced by heaven and humanity; it is not transmitted to the unworthy. I once received it from the Lord of Eastern Florescence, who received it from the Lord of the Golden Tower, who received it from the Queen Mother of the West. The Queen Mother of the West transmitted it orally, without written record. Now, in this world, I have written and recorded it. Those of superior attainment who awaken to it ascend as officials of heaven; those of middling attainment become immortals of the Southern Palace; those of lesser attainment who obtain it enjoy long life in the world, roaming the Three Realms and ascending through the Golden Gate."

The Perfected of Left Mystery said: "Those who study the Dao and recite this scripture will be protected by the ten celestial benevolent spirits. Then, with the jade talisman guarding the spirit and the golden liquid refining the form, both form and spirit become wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth."

The Perfected of Orthodox Unity said: "Households possessing this scripture, if they awaken to its meaning, will be free from calamities and obstructions. All sages will guard their gates, their spirits will ascend to the upper realms, and they will pay homage to the Most Honored. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, they will be received by the Lord Emperor. Those who recite and uphold it without ceasing will ascend amidst purple clouds."

*Transmission of Scriptures*
Su Shangqing said: "A youth transmits the scriptures and inquires of the perfected; with a heartless response to the world, he abides in eternal peace. When the time comes to serve the scriptures, there will be a day of wind and clouds—then he shall ride the simurgh and tread the jade steps of the celestial court."

*Opening the Scriptures*
Qiu Changchun said: "Those who leave the household have a dharma saying: 'Be loyal to the sovereign above, filial to parents below.' Those who neither bow to the sovereign above nor to parents below are neither loyal nor filial. Such self-aggrandizing and self-exalting words do not accord with the great Dao and make entry into the immortal lineage difficult—they have forgotten their roots."

Master Yin said: "Among the ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures, loyalty and filial piety come first. In heaven and on earth, expediency is foremost."

*Awakening*
Bai Yuchan said: "Mulberry fields become seas, seas become fields—in a single instant, a hundred years pass. If you turn the pivot at the crown of the head, who among you is not a Perfected of the Great Mystery?"

*Enlightened Master*
Wu Zhenzi said: "Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without meeting an enlightened master, do not force guesses. For the golden elixir has no oral transmission—where then can you bind the numinous embryo?"

*Oral Transmission*
Liao Zhenzi said: "The great medicine consists of three: essence, *qi*, and spirit—naturally, mother and child are mutually intimate. Returning the wind to merge with the true body, the work of refinement renews day by day."

*Practice of Merit*
Liao Zhenzi said: "Within the merit of no-merit, strive diligently in merit; beyond merit, no merit accords with sagely merit."

Refining the Elixir Field into supreme treasure, let the crow and hare race east and west as they will.

*Attaining the Dao*
Bi Yuanshu said: A single grain of golden elixir—how resplendently red! Large as a pellet, yellow as a tangerine. Each person’s share is originally perfect and complete; nightly, the numinous radiance ever fills the chamber.

*Transcending the Mundane*
Chen Niuwan said: After a year’s gestation, one child is born—offspring begetting offspring in endless branches. In the myriad billions of transformations lies the subtlest marvel—how could this be lightly taught to others?

*Entering Sagehood*
Lü Dongbin said: Alone I ascend the high mountain to gaze upon the eight directions; black clouds disperse, leaving the moon solitary. In the boundless cosmos, countless are the people—how many among them are true men?

*Laozi’s Scripture on Constant Clarity and Stillness, with Commentary*
Hainan Qiong Guanzi Bai Yuchan divided the text into chapters and corrected errors; Wang Yuanhui of Zhongnan, the Hidden and Subtle Master, provided annotations.

*Tai* means “non-being”; *shang* means “ultimate”; *shuo* means “to unfold and transform.” *Chang qing jing* (“constant clarity and stillness”) refers to the vast and formless Dao, naturally arising and completing the Three Powers and the myriad things—unchanged from ancient times to the present.

*Jing* means “the heart,” the mystery within mystery, the gate of all wonders. Master Shao said: “Heaven’s creative transformations emerge from unity; human affairs arise from the heart’s governance. How could heaven and humanity possess two different principles? The Dao does not operate in vain—it resides solely in the person.”

*Chapter One: The Primordial Dao*
Laozi said: (Commentary by Laozi appears earlier in *Origins and Sources*. The present edition omits the two characters *Tai Shang*.)

The *Daode Jing* states: “The Dao as it emerges from the mouth is bland, seemingly without flavor. Looked for, it cannot be seen; listened for, it cannot be heard; used, it cannot be exhausted.”

The Fuxi Superior Man said: “Once you grasp the delight within the zither, why labor over the sound upon the strings?”

The Great Dao is formless, the beginning of non-being. It gives birth to heaven and earth, requiring no arrangement—naturally so.

The *Divine Empyrean Scripture* states: “Vast and formless, spirit and *qi* constitute the real. Spirit is not vague; *qi* is not misty. Spirit generates the myriad spirits; *qi* generates the myriad *qi*. The myriad spirits return to one; the myriad *qi* merge into one. Spirit is the mechanism of the Dao; *qi* is its pivot. As the mechanism shifts and the pivot transforms, the Three Realms come into being. The Primordial Ancestral Spirit generates the myriad perfected; the Primordial Ancestral *Qi* transforms the various heavens.”

The Great Dao is without sentiment, the beginning of being. It sets the sun and moon in motion. The numinous treasure of pure clarity illumines without end.

The *Jin Astronomic Treatise* states: “Heaven is round like an inverted canopy; earth is square like a chessboard. Half the celestial sphere lies above the earth, half below. The sun and moon originally move eastward, while heaven rotates westward.”

The *Han Armillary Sphere* states: “The celestial sphere measures 365¼ degrees. Its body is round like a pellet, higher in the north and lower in the south, resembling an inverted canopy. The north celestial pole rises 36 degrees above the earth; the south celestial pole sinks 36 degrees below. The straight-line distance between the south and north poles is slightly less than 182 degrees. Following the curvature of the celestial sphere, the distance between the poles is slightly more than 182 degrees, precisely at the center of heaven. Midway between the north and south poles lies the equator, 91 degrees from each pole. At the spring equinox, the sun travels along the equator. At the summer solstice, it moves 24 degrees north of the equator, 67 degrees from the north pole and 115 degrees from the south pole—this is called the ‘black path.’ After the summer solstice, the sun gradually moves southward; at the autumn equinox, it returns to the equator, as at the spring equinox. At the winter solstice, it travels 24 degrees south of the equator, 67 degrees from the south pole and 115 degrees from the north pole—this is called the ‘yellow path.’ After the winter solstice, the sun gradually moves northward again. Moreover, the moon’s path closely parallels the sun’s, crossing it at two points. Half lies within the sun’s path, half outside. Where they intersect, the two paths coincide; at their farthest separation, they diverge by six degrees. Such is the general outline of the sun and moon’s movements.”

The *Han Records* state: “The sun moves one degree per day; the moon moves 13⁷⁄₁₉ degrees per day. The sun moves slowly, the moon swiftly. The sun is fundamentally yang; the moon is fundamentally yin. The moon cannot illuminate itself but relies on the sun for brightness. When it conjoins with the sun, it becomes dark (new moon); when it opposes the sun, it becomes full. Its waxing follows a sequence: after three days, a crescent appears—hence it is called *fěi*. After eight days, the moon has traversed 84¼ degrees, and its brightness reaches half—hence it is called the ‘first quarter.’ After fifteen days, it is called the ‘full moon,’ for it faces the sun and shines fully. After sixteen days, the lunar essence (*pò*) begins to grow, as the yin essence waxes and brightness wanes. After twenty-three days, the lunar essence reaches half—hence it is called the ‘last quarter.’ After 27½ days, the moon has traversed 365 degrees, completing its celestial circuit, while the sun has moved 27 degrees ahead. Thus, the moon must travel another 2½ days to rejoin the sun at the next new moon.”

It further states: “Earth resides at the center while heaven revolves around it. When the sun is above the earth, it is day; when below, night. Such is the path of the sun and moon’s movement.”

The *Divine Empyrean Scripture* states: “Once chaos divided, the Brahma-*qi* expanded. The great became the sun and moon; the fine became the stars.”

Master Yunfang said: “The sun and moon are the essence of yin and yang, giving birth to and completing the myriad things. Rising in the east and setting in the west, they divide day and night; moving south and north, they determine cold and heat.”

Master Zhu said: “Kunlun is vast beyond all bounds, its depths and expanse immeasurable. Yin and yang never cease their movement; cold and heat alternate in their coming and going.”

The Great Dao is nameless, the origin of the myriad images. It nurtures the myriad things. The two *qi* intermingle, and the myriad things transform into harmony.

Laozi said: “The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things.”

The *Book of Changes* states: “The Way of earth is to contain and radiate vastness. The myriad things rely on it for birth. It is stirred by thunder and nourished by wind and rain.”

Master Zhu said: “The Supreme Harmony spreads through all beings; the Benefit and Perseverance secure the numinous root. Without sincerity, nothing exists; the five natures truly abide herein. I know not its name, and so forcefully call it the Dao.”

The Left Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate said: “The Limitless merges with the Great Dao in transformation, establishes the root of heaven and earth, distributes *qi* throughout the ten directions, and embraces the utmost purity of virtue and power. Vast and boundless, it cannot be named.” Thus, Laozi called it the Dao; the *Spring and Autumn Annals* called it the Origin; the *Book of Changes* called it the Supreme Ultimate.

Master Zhang said: “From *qi* transformation arises the name of the Dao.” He also said: “From *qi* transformation arise the names of the Way of heaven, the Way of earth, and the Way of man.”

Chen Zi’ang said: “Confucius expounded the Supreme Ultimate; Laozi prized the profound and obscure. The Golden Immortals of the West revere righteousness, yet it is ignorance.”

**Chapter Two: The Naturalness of Creation**

As for the Dao, before *qi* was manifest, there was clarity—the beginning of yang *qi*; there was turbidity—the beginning of yin *qi*. There was movement and stillness. Yang moves and yin is still, giving rise to the Three Powers. Heaven is clear and earth is turbid: clear *qi* becomes heaven, turbid *qi* becomes earth. Heaven moves and earth is still. Heaven is round and moves, enveloping the earth without. Earth is square and still, situated within heaven. Man is clear and woman is turbid; man moves and woman is still.

☰ The male and ☷ the female unite and give birth. Descending from root to branch, they generate the myriad things.

☰☷☳ The Three Powers give birth to the myriad things.

*Guanzi* said: “That which is empty and formless is called the Dao.”

The *Han Treatise on Harmonics and Calendrics* states: “The primordial *qi* of the Supreme Ultimate contains the Three as One”—that is, heaven, earth, and man.

*Liezi* said: “The light and clear *qi* of the primordial *qi* becomes heaven; the heavy and turbid becomes earth; the harmonious and balanced *qi* becomes man.”

Master Zhu said: “When the *qi* of heaven and earth combine, they encounter the transformations of cold and heat, dryness and dampness, wind and fire in their alternating dominance. Thus, human *qi* follows them, and the myriad things are transformed and born. All arises from the union and dispersion of the three *qi*, generating endless transformations.”

Master *Wu Zhen* said: “The Dao arises from emptiness and generates the One *qi*; from the One *qi* emerge yin and yang. Yin and yang unite to form the Three Bodies; the Three Bodies give rise to the flourishing of the myriad things. Clarity is the source of solitude; movement is the foundation of stillness.”

Shaozi said: “From the Limitless arises the Supreme Ultimate, in the undifferentiated vastness. Yang moves and yin is still—all within the Supreme Ultimate. Yang moves and yin is still, endlessly circulating. The original substance of the Supreme Ultimate resides within yin and yang.”

The Buddha said: “Water flows, yet its source is the sea; the moon sets, yet it does not leave the sky.” (Another version reads: “Stillness is the foundation of movement.”)

“If one can constantly abide in clarity and stillness, heaven and earth will all return.”

The *Great Cavern Scripture* states: “Man is born with the form of heaven.”

Li Shaowei said: “I am heaven and earth; heaven and earth are I.”

Master Liu said: “The Dao does not seek emptiness; emptiness naturally returns to it. If one can empty the heart, the Dao will naturally return.”

Master Yuxi said: “Why is this heart connected to great creation? Only because it originally comes from the Dao.”

**Chapter Three: Uniting Spirit with the Dao**

The human spirit favors clarity, yet the heart disturbs it. The Dao is originally without demons; it is the human heart that creates obstacles.

Master Yuxi said: “From the Dao divides my original spirit; my original spirit is the Great Dao itself.”

Master Wang the Shoemaker said: “When the heart is at peace, the spirit is numinous; when the heart is scattered, the spirit is wild.”

Confucius asked Lao Dan: “May I inquire about the supreme Dao?”

Lao Dan replied: “Dredge and cleanse the heart; bathe and purify the spirit.”

The Queen Mother of the West said: “If sounds and colors do not cease, the spirit will not be clear. If thoughts and worries do not cease, the heart will not be at peace. When the heart is not at peace, the spirit is not numinous; when the spirit is not numinous, the Dao is not achieved.”

The human heart favors stillness, yet desires pull it away. “The Dao rises one foot; demons rise ten.” The True Lord of Heavenly Plans said: “Though the sun and moon are bright, floating clouds cover them; though rivers are clear, sand and stones muddy them; though the human heart is still, desires pull it away.”

The Emperor Lord of Zitong said: “White clouds are originally without intent; the wind sends them drifting from the peaks.”

If one can constantly dispel desires, the heart will naturally be still. With intent unobstructed and heart at ease, *qi* is robust and the spirit at peace.

The *Scripture of Perfect Realization* states: “Few desires, heart still; forget emotions, burdens light.”

Laozi said: “Its dwelling is deep and still—is this not the human heart?”

The *Scripture of Water and Fire* states: “Desire arises from the heart; stillness comes from settling the heart. Heart and breath depend on each other; when breath is regulated, the heart is still.”

When the heart is settled, the spirit naturally becomes clear. The cosmos radiates light, and demon kings bow their heads.

Master Yanluo said: “Settle the heart.” When the heart is settled and the spirit still, chaotic thoughts do not arise, perverse delusions do not invade, and worries and anxieties all vanish. “An empty room generates brightness”—this depends solely on settling the heart.

Lü Dongbin said: “One day of leisure is one day as an immortal; when the six spirits harmonize, one is naturally at peace. The cinnabar field holds treasure—why seek the Dao? Face circumstances without intent—why ask about Chan?”

Naturally, the six desires do not arise, and the three poisons are extinguished. The yin *po* dissipates, and the yang spirit manifests.

Bai Yuchan said: “Have you not seen that emptiness generates the natural? The natural generates the One *qi*. The One *qi* congeals into things; when *qi* is sufficient, heaven and earth divide. Heaven and earth are originally without intent; the two *qi* are naturally so. The myriad things have flourishing and decay; great destinies have endings and beginnings. If you comprehend the original naturalness of the prior heaven, you grasp the true root of nature and life.”

The *Dao De Jing* of five thousand words, the *Three Hundred Characters of the Yin Talisman*. Form and spirit, nature and life, body and heart, spirit and *qi*. Their interaction and fusion form the great treasure—this is the principle of the golden elixir. The worldly often cling to things, provisionally taking “having action” as the return to “non-action.”

A resolute man of mettle may grasp the essence—
try these words, slowly savoring them in quiet.
If you trace the hearts of ancient sages and worthies,
their laws for transforming others were never amiss.
How much more, then, to stride straight down the direct path,
a single road ascending to the Three Clarities’ halls.

Master Xu Jing of Empty Tranquility said:
“The superior man who attains it and preserves it—
ascension is simply this work.”
Yet those who cannot do so
are disordered in *qi* by wealth, confused in nature by wine and sensuality.

Xi Kang said:
“There are five difficulties in nurturing life:
failing to extinguish fame and profit,
failing to remove joy and anger,
failing to cast off sound and beauty,
failing to sever rich flavors,
and the dissipation of spirit and thought.”

Liu Haichan said:
“Cultivating immortality is most easy—
it is man who makes it hard.
Shedding the dust is not difficult—
it is man who finds it not easy.”

The Perfected of Pure Emptiness said:
“A three-year-old child can speak of it,
yet an eighty-year-old cannot practice it.”
For the heart is not yet settled—
living, fluid, turning, limpid.

The *Scripture of Salvation* says:
“The human Dao lies in the heart—
truly, it does not depend on others.”

Wang Zhiyuan said:
“Like striking a ball upon swift waters.”

Han Xiang said:
“Waves churn the sea of nature,
clouds veil the heaven of the heart.”

Long ago, Master Ma Danyang secluded himself on Mount Zhongnan.
One day, Liu Chuxuan arrived and bowed outside the hermitage wall.
Danyang, knowing Liu’s heart was not yet extinguished,
called to him through the wall:
“Go to the Liu Immortal Maiden in Henan Prefecture.
Return after three years.”
Liu immediately set out.
The Immortal Maiden, foreseeing his arrival,
adorned herself and awaited him.
At first sight, Liu’s heart stirred.
The Immortal Maiden said to him:
“I merely tested you.
Remove this heart, and your task is complete.”
Liu, filled with remorse,
sat in meditation in the tiled alleyways of Luoyang’s flower district,
daily transforming food to sustain himself.
After three years, his heart extinguished,
he sensed attainment and returned to see Danyang.
Danyang, seeing him, said:
“It is done.”
And transmitted the Dao.

Here is the translation:

---

Now, the Perfected Immortal Liu of the Quanzhen School is such a one.

Huayangzi said:
*One day the heavens are windless,
The four seas’ waves all stilled.
Yet the human heart’s wind does not cease—
Its waves rise a hundred feet high.*
Desire has not yet been dispelled.

The ear follows sound astray; the eye is deceived by form.
The Lady of Upper Prime said to Emperor Wu:
“Do you love the Dao?
You have summoned many masters, climbed mountains to sacrifice to spirits—this is indeed diligent.
Yet your inborn nature is violent, your inborn nature is lewd, your inborn nature is extravagant, your inborn nature is cruel, your inborn nature is treacherous—these five ever dwell within your *rongwei* and five viscera.
If from now on you cast aside these five natures, return to softness and goodness, constantly practice yin virtue, save and deliver those in mortal peril, and refrain from spilling essence, there may yet be hope for you.”

Master Cao said:
*A maiden of sixteen, her body like soft lard,
At her waist hangs a sword to slay fools.
Though no heads seem to fall,
In secret she drains the wise of marrow and bone.*
One who can dispel this lets all things dissolve in a single laugh.

Wei Yuanjun said:
*Enough, enough, enough!
World-conquering fame and merit bring no freedom.*

Huang Shigong said:
*Cut off cravings, restrain desires—this removes encumbrances.
Reject wine, renounce sensuality—this keeps one unstained.*

Wenzi said:
*Cast aside what lures and entices; remove what you crave and desire.*

Huang Shigong also said:
*Court ministers wait for dawn in the fifth watch’s cold,
Generals in iron armor cross passes at night.
The recluse sleeps late, still abed at daybreak—
Count it up: fame and profit are not so fine as idleness.*

Turn the gaze inward upon the heart; reflect the light back—this is to rectify the heart.
When the heart is without its heart—

Zhuangzi said:
*The Dao is the Supreme Ultimate.
The heart is the Supreme Ultimate.*

He also said:
*When the heart is without opposition or compliance, it is no-heart.*

The Three Lords of Mao said:
*The spirit terrace, limpid as an ice-filled flask,
Only permits the original spirit to dwell within.
If you leave even one thing inside,
How can you realize the Dao and merge with pure emptiness?*

Turn the gaze outward upon form; observe it through the Dao—neither noble nor base.
This is to rectify form.
When form is without its form—

Master Zhu said:
*The Dao as substance is so vast it has no outside, so minute it has no inside.*

The Left Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate said:
*Its body is naturally so,
Born before the Great Void, arising without cause.
It traverses heaven and earth from beginning to end—
No name or measure can contain it.*

The Perfected Immortal of the Great Mystery said:
*A speck of round brightness equals the Great Void,
Only because thought arises does the body form.
If you can let go and turn the light back,
It remains as before: pure emptiness, the original one thing.*

Before father and mother were born, all was spirit—
It is not spiritless, only because the body has formed.
Once formed, it veils the seed of radiance—
Let go, and it is once more utterly clear.

Observe afar the myriad things: if you regard them through things, you esteem yourself and belittle them.
This is to rectify things.
When things are without their things—

Bai Yuchan’s commentary on the *Laozi* said:
*The Dao as thing—
Ah, vague! Ah, indistinct!
Indistinct, ah vague! Within it are images.
Vague, ah indistinct! Within it are things.
Dark, ah profound! Within it is essence.
Its essence is most true; within it is sincerity.
From ancient times to now—*

*Within this lies the wondrous truth—
Who says one cannot attain long life?*

The *Divine Empyrean Scripture* said:
*Above, there is no further spirit; below, there is no further qi.*

Wuchengzi said:
*There is a thing prior to heaven and earth,
Formless, originally quiescent and desolate.
It can be lord of the ten thousand images,
Unchanging through the four seasons’ decay.*

Once these three are awakened to, only emptiness is seen.
Enclose the three in one—precious is spontaneity.

The *Scripture of Heavenly Protection and Longevity* said:
*Observe afar the responsive and transformed—no responsive transformation: no things.
Observe within the original spirit—no original spirit: no heart.
Observe without the dharma-realm—no dharma-realm: no form.
Naturally, respond with stillness and be still—within stillness is spirit.
From nonbeing arises being; essence can generate qi.
Respond with quiescence and be quiescent—quiescent and thus true.
Within emptiness, not empty—qi can generate spirit.*

Xiaoyaozi said:
*Not knowing this principle,
Only because it is too distinct.*

Observe emptiness through emptiness—emptiness has nothing to empty.
The Dao has no image.

Xu Jingsun’s *Stone Casket Record* said:
*Play with true emptiness, reveal immortal traces—
Do not say we shall meet again in a future life.
Too foolish and ignorant, cease discussing the wondrous!
To speak of true emptiness is to speak of true emptiness.
Affairs are not different from emptiness—this is form.
Form is not empty—its colors bloom and glow red.
I reveal to you the secret of my lineage:
The sun moves into the bright moon.
The bright moon, the sun—these are heaven’s medicine.
When humans ingest it, they ride phoenixes and cranes.*

Shi Xinglin said:
*Not knowing the wondrousness of the elixir scripture,
All day they toy with true emptiness.
What is emptied is already nothing—
Nothingness, too, is nothing.*

The spirit has no direction.

*The Huainanzi* states: The great man is serene and free from striving, roaming carefree with the transformations of creation.

Master Liaozhen said:
The great Dao was originally nothing at all—
If you can guard this One, the spirit dwells within.
This heart, clear as the moon at the pond’s center,
Unbound by even a thread, is naturally thus.
Nothingness, too, is nothing—profoundly still and quiescent.

The nature has no form.
*The Sutra of Unobstructed Supreme Vehicle* states: When the mind arises, the nature perishes; when the mind is quiescent, the nature appears. Like empty space without image, profoundly still and quiescent.

Qiu Changchun said:
The Dao and virtue are originally without image—
Painting and ink cannot capture their truth.
Sages and worthies silently aid the world,
From ancient times to now, wordlessly communing with the divine.
Stillness has no object of stillness—how could desire arise?

Qi has no form.
Laozi said: I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I am without affairs, and the people enrich themselves; I am without desire, and the people become simple.

Master Wuzhen said:
Good and evil forgotten in a single thought,
Honor and decay no longer touch the heart.
When desire does not arise, this is true stillness.

Mists disperse, the sun shines bright;
Dust settles, the mirror gleams clear.
Lady Wei said: The Dao arises from tranquility.

Long ago, Shi Jianwu, who had long yearned for the Dao, practiced without success. Day and night, he reflected, burdened as if by thorns. Upon reading *The Three Clarities Scripture*, he found: Those who cultivate and refine must enter the Three Gates of Stillness, tempering spirit and qi, mending and extending years and life.

Great Stillness: three hundred days;
Middle Stillness: two hundred days;
Lesser Stillness: one hundred days.
Resolving to test himself with Lesser Stillness, he shut his door and did not emerge, fulfilling the hundred-day term before leaving the stillness chamber. Before a month had passed, his spirit shone radiant; at a hundred days, his essence and vitality were clear and robust.

At three hundred days, his eyes gleamed like lacquer dots, his skin smooth as congealed lard; all long-standing ailments dissolved, and body and mind felt light and refreshed. Thus one knows the wondrous formulas of the immortals’ scriptures are no empty words.

Shi Xinglin said:
*No speck clouds the heart-heaven,
No dust stirs on the nature-earth.
In the still night where the moon shines bright,
A spring bird’s call rings clear.*

In true stillness, one responds to things—
*Round and full, luminous and bright.*
(An alternate version reads: *In true constancy, one responds to things.*)

Laozi said: *There is a thing, formless yet complete, born before heaven and earth.*

Liu Haichan said: *He who only awakens to true nature and refrains from refining the elixir—know that through ten thousand kalpas, transformation remains arduous.*

Master Wang the Cobbler said: *When qi stills, spirit gathers; when spirit gathers, the elixir forms.*

*The Stone Casket Record* states: *The Dao of the elixir is not forged from the five metals of the human realm, nor the eight minerals, cinnabar, or mercury. It is the merging of form with emptiness, vast and utterly void—this is called true emptiness. The body of true emptiness is the foundation of the returned elixir, the mother of the great medicine.*

*What form does the mother of the great medicine take? What appearance, what substance? The substance is a thing within the formless, a thing that comes to dwell before the throne of the Emperor. The Emperor’s throne is true emptiness, united with spontaneity. True emptiness and spontaneity merge with form and image; form and image are set in motion by spirit. As true emptiness moves, it is not empty—its wondrous non-emptiness holds numinous power.*

Master Qiu said:
*At the first turning of the elixir,
In the dark depths of the sea, a red sun rises.
Auspicious clouds and mist fill the Three Fields,
And a mysterious pearl, like a millet grain, is sown.*

*At the second turning,
The flaming Vermilion Bird scorches heaven and earth.
Rosy light enters the crucible, tiger and dragon coil—
A single grain of yellow sprout, like a dog’s tooth, appears.*

*At the third turning,
The three powers blend their images to form the elixir.
Its appearance, fair or plain, follows one’s intent—
The celestial essence that shapes the body has begun.*

*At the fourth turning,
The sacred gate of Penglai’s isles remains ever sealed.
In stillness, the Wheel of Longevity turns in secret,
And boundless numinous light illumines the true adept.*

*At the fifth turning,
The numinous true one daily cultivates the immortal’s abode.
Layer upon layer, the Dao’s qi augments its radiance,
Ever nourishing the lord of spirit and light.*

*At the sixth turning,
Day and night, the river chariot races along the sacred axle.
The numinous spring ascends to Kunlun’s peak—
A wheel of moon bathes in the Jasper Pool.*

*At the seventh turning,
Within the light of non-doing, the numinous essence is concealed.
The true officials uphold the Dao’s qi,
And a thousand spirits descend with blessings to the spirit chamber.*

*At the eighth turning,
The fetal immortal is refined, full as the moon.
Walking together, sitting together, sleeping together,
Though amid the dust, none recognize him.*

*At the ninth turning,
The sacred work is complete, the fetal immortal perfected.
Having attained the body of freedom in emptiness,
No further firing is needed.*

True constancy attains nature.
The wondrous one, the numinous presence,
Is perfectly attuned across the Three Realms.

Li Huayang said: *To neglect true nature and pursue only life-destiny—this is the foremost malady in cultivation.*

Nature is like a vessel: what it contains is like a precious pearl, and the light within the pearl is nature. When nature manifests, in the womb it becomes the body, in the world it becomes a person; in the eyes it is seeing, in the ears it is hearing, in the nose it smells fragrance, in the mouth it speaks; the hands move, the feet act—scattered, it fills the six directions; gathered, it resides in the square inch of the heart. The wise recognize it as true nature; the deluded mistake it for the hun-soul.

*The Stone Casket Record* states: *The primal womb of father and mother cannot be discussed—vast and teeming, it births ten thousand kinds of souls. Conceived in the womb, born in moisture, transformed in the fourth month: humans, beasts, birds, insects—countless forms. Each is endowed with nature, and nature is linked to life-destiny, the soul bound to life. Fundamentally, humans and animals alike receive qi from the father and form from the mother. Following the hidden pattern of heaven and earth, when qi is sufficient, they are born, each with its proper nature and destiny. This principle is perfectly clear. Now, when practitioners speak of sitting transformation, if their thoughts err at the final moment, they lose their body and enter another womb. Truly, this is a warning!*

Master Xu Jing said: *The Dao is not far—it resides within the body. All things are empty, yet nature is not empty. If nature is not empty and unites with qi, qi returns to the primal sea, and life knows no end.*

Ever responsive,
Ever still,
Ever pure and still.

Master Hao said: *The body of concentration is without thought; the illumination of wisdom is boundless. When concentration and wisdom merge, wondrous function is infinite.*

Master Cao said: *Merge into one and then forget the one—you may emerge and submerge with the primal transformation. Piercing metal and stone is no difficulty; sitting liberation and standing transcendence are swift as a flash.*

In such purity and stillness,
One gradually enters the true Dao.
*Mind and nature unstained,
One enters the gate of a myriad wonders.*

Master Han said: *The great Dao of emptiness and nothingness is pure, still, subtle, and recondite. Unstained is called pure; unmoving is called still; unseen is called subtle; unheard is called recondite. Diligently practice these four, and after three years, one escapes the wheel of rebirth.*

He also said: *When the six roots are pure and the square inch is limpid, with long practice, one may sit and command ghosts and spirits, summon wind and rain. How can this be taken lightly?*

Sa Shoujian said:
*Autumn moon on a cold pond,
Green stream without a trace.*

Having entered the true Dao, one is called *attained the Dao.*
The mind is like empty space, yet empty space is not the mind.

Master Red Pine said: *Returning to nature, one enters emptiness; concentrating spirit, one enters primordial chaos.*

The ancients said: *Immortals are but mortals who have done it—this is called attaining the Dao.*

Xue Daoguang said: *The guests of Penglai’s three isles are not in the west.*

Though called *attained the Dao,* if one’s manifestation of the Dharma is not true—

Liu Haichan said: *The true mark is without mark, the wondrous Dharma-gate.*

Master Wu Zhen said: *Light at the nape is still illusion; clouds beneath the feet are not yet immortality.*

Truly, there is nothing attained.
*True Dharma does not manifest.*
Seen, it cannot be seen—*it is without color.*
Heard, it cannot be heard—*it is without sound.*
Grasped, it cannot be grasped—*it is without form.*

Master Yuxi said: *To seek it in another’s heart is futile—it is neither within nor without, neither between.*

Beheld, it cannot be seen; heard, it is without sound—
vast and luminous, it pervades the ten thousand realms.

The Immortal Scriptures say: *Within the profound and obscure, the primordial true qi is dimly discerned.*
Zhou Ziyang said: *Like a fish drinking water, the warmth or chill is known only to oneself.*
Tao Hongjing said: *It may only delight the self; it cannot be sent to another.*

To transform sentient beings is called *attaining the Dao.*
The myriad transformations all interpenetrate—*the Dao is fundamentally nameless.*
The *Huainanzi* says: *The supreme Dao is non-action; it expands and contracts, rolls and unfurls, changing with the times.*

Thus the Most High adapts teachings to circumstances to reveal the Dao.
Yet the ten thousand dharmas and thousand gates ultimately converge in the One—
though their names differ, they all emerge from the heart.

The *Six Secret Teachings* records Taigong’s words: *All people possess nature, yet their inclinations diverge.*
Those who awaken to it may attain the sagely Dao.
*Thought is called wisdom; wisdom makes the sage.*

Master Zhang said: *To truly know the root-source is called knowing the Dao.*
Master Zhu said: *From ancient times to the present, it has rolled on thus—nothing but the alternation of yin and yang. What impels this? The Dao.*
Master Shao said:
*When one awakens to the flux of fortune and misfortune, advance and retreat become clear;
when one sees through Qian and Kun, closeness and distance are discerned.
Since grasping the meaning of the center,
the mind’s idle qi has vanished without a trace.*

**Chapter Four: The Perception of the Wise and Foolish**

The Most High Lord Lao said:
*The superior person does not contend—* *nature’s heaven is vast.*
*The inferior person loves contention—* *wisdom’s power knows no bounds.*

Laozi said: *The Dao of Heaven does not contend, yet excels in victory.*
The Immortal Scriptures say: *Guarding the Dao for a single day can seize the primal qi of Heaven and Earth for a year.*

Sa Shoujian said: *A solitary cloud drifts in freedom; a wild crane roams at will.*

The virtuous of high virtue do not act as if virtuous—*non-action.*
The virtuous of low virtue cling to virtue—*action.*

Yanzi said: *Cast off the limbs, dull the senses, depart from form, abandon knowledge.*
Wenzi said: *Vast intelligence and broad wisdom are guarded by foolishness; extensive learning and eloquence are guarded by restraint.*

Zhang Jiucheng said:
*In poverty, one despairs; in wealth, one grows arrogant—
turning the heart, alone one delights in a simple gourd bowl.
The joy found here no one understands;
long have I lamented the fading of this legacy.*

The Queen Mother of the West said: *Gazing at stars and worshipping the moon, one wearies the self and labors the body; chasing appearances and seeking sounds, one yearns for immortality to cure illness.*
The *Records of the Grand Historian* records Bian Que’s words: *When illness reaches the marrow, even the Controller of Fate can do nothing.*

Those who cling to it cannot be called *virtuous or moral.*
Chasing delusion, they lose the true.

The *Scripture of the Nine Elixirs* says: *What humans may preserve is life; what is lamentable is the body; what may be stored is qi; what is precious is essence.*

As for massage and guiding qi, ingesting qi and consuming mist, closing doors to circulate qi, controlling women to absorb yin, visualizing thoughts and raising intentions, abstaining from grain and forsaking wives—
all such secondary methods—

Su Zhan said: *If it is not truly mine, not even a hair’s breadth should be taken.*

**Chapter Five: Manifesting Without Limit**

The Most High Lord Lao said: All beings fail to attain the true Dao because they possess deluded minds. They covet what they love and know no rest.

The *Scripture of Clarifying the Mind* states: The mind is the origin of the Dao; the mind is the root of calamity.

An earlier perfected one said: Mortals value fine silks for their bodies and feast on delicacies; their eyes are bewitched by wanton colors, their ears confounded by lewd sounds. What they yearn for is glory, wealth, and honor—each day they sink deeper into delusion. How could they know of the profound mystery between Heaven and Earth?

Master Yin Shou said: Delusion’s clouds lock the moon of wisdom; karmic winds stir the sea of stillness.

Once the deluded mind arises, it startles the spirit. The eyes see and the heart stirs; the ears hear and the spirit wanders.

The Han Celestial Master said: When the mind gives rise to dharmas, qi scatters and the spirit departs.

Master Cao said: This thing has no fixed place—it transforms with the mind’s intent. In the body, when it senses heat, it becomes sweat; in the nose, when it meets wind, it becomes mucus; in the kidneys, when stirred by passion, it becomes essence; in the eyes, when moved by sorrow, it becomes tears. Flowing and turning within qi and blood, in the end it never leaves spirit and qi.

The Venerable Celestial Master said: If the spirit departs, draw it back; when the spirit returns to the body, qi naturally returns. Thus, morning and evening, the red child gives birth to the true embryo.

Once the spirit is startled, it clings to the myriad things.

The Dao gives them life.
Zhong Hui said: When spirit and qi scatter, they become the myriad things.
Laozi said: The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang.
Bai Yuchan said: This Dao constantly abides within the myriad things—what thing is not within this Dao?
Master Wu Zhen said: Yin and yang in grasses and trees are also paired; if one is lacking, they cannot flourish. First, green leaves open as yang takes the lead; next, red flowers bloom as yin follows. The constant Dao is but this in daily use—who knows the turning of the true source? I say to those who study the Dao: do not mock what you do not understand of yin and yang.

Once they cling to the myriad things,
Virtue nurtures them.
Perfected Master Yin said: Those who are good at my Dao know Heaven within a single thing and exhaust the spirit to fulfill destiny.
Master Shao said: A single thing comes with a body; within that body is another heaven and earth. You must know that the myriad things are complete within me—how could the Three Powers be established apart from this root?

Then they give rise to greed and desire.
Day by day, renew; again, renew each day.
Xu Jingyang said: Once my elixir is complete, transformations are free and unbounded. What I lack is only the Celestial Mandate’s decree. Thus, I accumulate merit to await the true mandate.
Perfected Master Qiu said: When the elixir turns, cherish and nurture it; for three years, guard against danger and disgrace. Aid others, benefit things, and accumulate hidden merit—then you may tread the void and ascend to receive the Celestial Register.

Once greed and desire arise, there is only affliction.
Within the twelve hours, guard fullness and hold abundance.
The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: Immortals and Daoists are not divine—they become true by accumulating essence and piling up qi.
Zhuangzi said: What does not depart from essence is called spirit.
Yun Fang said: The initial work is easy, but steadfast resolve is hard—naturally, the clouds part. The golden liquid and returning elixir are known here; seek them not outside the body. The Yellow Matchmaker pairs with you; when the golden crucible refines the elixir, it glows crimson. Cultivate yourself; cherish yourself. Yang begins at the head, yin at the spine. This alone is the metal within water—seek nothing else. The golden elixir is but a hundred days’ work; when complete, you will forever be a Penglai elder.

Afflictions and deluded thoughts—images in the mind, spirits in dreams.
Xu Jingyang said: Abide in stillness, settle the spirit, and let no stray thoughts arise.
Yun Fang said: In stillness, you may see splendid images and manifold pleasures—do not acknowledge them, for they are deluded thoughts.
Immortal Li said: Preserve the spirit, nurture qi and essence; purify and still the mind’s light. If deluded thoughts do not arise in vain, the true Dao may be attained.

Worry and suffering for body and mind—
In movement and stillness, sitting and lying, guard it as you would an infant.
Prince Wang Qiao said: When the mind is without action, the body is naturally at peace.
Duke Cao said: I urge you to cherish body and mind.
Master Shao said: The body comes after Heaven and Earth; the mind comes before them. Heaven and Earth emerge from me—what else is worth mentioning?

Then they encounter defilement and disgrace, drifting through the cycles of life and death. Noble and base, high and low—life and death are equal.
Master Pei Qingxu said: Defilement and disgrace are greed and delusion.
Laozi said: Those who know contentment are not disgraced. Arrogance in wealth and honor brings one’s own misfortune.
Wang Panshan said: A single thought of non-arising is non-dying.
Li Huayang said: Life and death are but the gathering and scattering of qi.
Guo Pu said: Life and death, gathering and scattering—transformations are boundless.
Master Yuxi said: When the heart harbors emotion and nature bears dust, dust and emotion play their games, and life and death never cease.
An earlier perfected one said: The unborn and undying are the original true; the priceless night-glowing pearl is unrecognized. Mortals waste thousands of lives, mixed in the ore, unable to emerge. Forever sinking in the sea of suffering, they eternally lose the true Dao.

When essence is exhausted and qi perishes, qi’s demise brings the spirit’s extinction.
The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: The body’s essence and spirit must not be lost.

Long ago, Xu Jingyang and his disciples arrived at a market—now called the Charcoal Woman Market. As dusk fell, he transformed charcoal into beautiful women to test them. Only Zhou and ten others remained unstained, all ascending to Heaven; the rest were moved in their hearts, enchanted and sinking into the sea of desire. At dawn, they saw it was only charcoal. Each knew they had lost the Dao and departed in shame.

Lord Yin said: Do not shun gain and loss—cultivate with single-minded resolve, and the returning elixir may be hoped for.
An Qisheng said: A thousand days of nurturing are insufficient; a single day of harm is too much.

The Dao of true constancy—those who awaken attain it themselves.
If you attain it within this mystery of mysteries—
Xu Jingyang said: The Dao of true constancy takes loyalty and filial piety as the source of all conduct and expedient means as the root of all goodness.

Water Qiuzi said: Unchanging and unerring—this is called true constancy.
*The Original Biography of the Dark Emperor* states: Loyalty complete and filial piety perfected—these ensure promotion to transcendence.
*The Scripture of Limpid Clarity* states: May my children ever hold filial devotion in their hearts. At home, they serve their parents; in court, they are loyal to their lord. They do not engage in avaricious or lustful conduct, nor dissipate essence and spirit. Blessings flow like a spring, naturally clear and ceaseless.

Master Zitong said: Daily conduct is all the Dao; unwavering persistence is all the Dao.
Bai Yuchan said: The ordinary mind is the Dao—no need for discriminating thought.

Guangchengzi said: The essence of the supreme Dao is subtle and obscure; its ultimate reaches are dim and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness, and the body will right itself. Be still, be pure—do not weary your form, do not agitate your essence, and you may attain longevity. Guard within, seal without—excessive knowledge leads to ruin. I abide in unity to dwell in harmony, thus I have lived twelve hundred years and my form has never aged. Those who attain my Dao ascend to sovereignty; those who lose it descend to dust. I shall now depart from you, entering the gate of the boundless, roaming the limitless wilds, sharing radiance with the sun and moon, and enduring with Heaven and Earth. All others will perish, yet I alone shall remain.

Do you understand?
Danyangzi said:
A single spark of numinous light illumines the vast void—
No painter’s hand, however skilled, could ever capture it.
Do not idly compare it to the bright moon,
For what is flawed and conditioned cannot resemble me.

Those who awaken to the Dao—
Beyond this mystery of mysteries, there is no further mystery.

Zhuangzi said: The Dao precedes the Supreme Ultimate yet is not exalted; it lies beneath the Supreme Ultimate yet is not profound. It existed before Heaven and Earth yet is not ancient; it endures beyond high antiquity yet is not aged.

Xiweishi attained it and thereby grasped Heaven and Earth;
Fuxishi attained it and thereby embraced the Mother of Qi;
The Dipper attained it and thus remains unerring through all ages;
The sun and moon attained it and thus never cease their course;
Kanpi attained it and thereby inherited Kunlun;
Feng Yi attained it and thereby dwells in the Dark Palace;
Yuqiang attained it and thereby stands at the North Pole;
The Queen Mother attained it and thereby sits upon Shaoguang.

The Han Celestial Master attained it, ascending in three generations and achieving liberation in seven;
Xu Jingyang attained it, raising his entire household into the void;
Wei Yuanjun attained it, ascending to the Purple Void;
Master Ge the Immortal attained it and ascended, his wife achieving liberation, his daughter likewise;
Master Liu of Dongtian attained it and ascended, his wife achieving liberation, his daughter likewise.

These are but a few examples. As for the ranks of immortals who awakened to the great Dao—their ends are beyond knowing.

The Way is ever pure and still.

○ Heaven and earth unite in their virtue; sun and moon unite in their brightness.
Master Yin the Perfected says: "Simply keep the mind long guiding qi, and qi will unite with spirit. With the center thus governed, the form endures forever. Like the sun and moon in their revolutions, like the turning of the celestial river, life becomes boundless and infinite—this is the attainment of the unfathomable Dao of emptiness, the realization of sagely wisdom and perfect comprehension. Concealed or revealed, moving between being and non-being, one roams the clouds at ease, ascending through the Golden Gate. Form and spirit merge in subtlety, uniting with the true Dao."

The *Central Yellow Scripture* says:
*"Maidens of the ten directions hold banners and streamers,
A hundred spirits array their chariots, jade lads follow.
Before them, dragon pennants; behind them, flags unfurled—
Feathered robes fluttering, they ascend to the Great Tenuity."*

Thus concludes the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness* spoken by the Most High Lord Lao.

○ "Be as careful at the end as at the beginning, and there will be no failure."
Now that the scripture has been expounded, what of the final, most wondrous phrase? How is it to be understood?

Lü Dongbin says:
*"The Dao is subtle and profound, its celestial mechanism deep and distant.
Even hastening to cultivate is already too late.
The path to Penglai—three thousand steps fulfilled—
One strides alone, returning upon the clouds."*

Bai Yuchan says:
*"For your sake, I speak this final phrase—
The very last word is personally entrusted.
For all under heaven who study immortality,
It clearly points the way to Penglai.
The Dao is fundamentally empty; within emptiness, being is set in motion.
Thus it is called 'wondrous being,' also 'true emptiness.'
Vast and unfathomable—why need scriptures?
Yet without scriptures, the Dao cannot be made clear.
Thus the Primordial Beginning unfolded the charts, spreading forth the five sections.
The true writ was revealed, disclosing the secret—
Rightly a ladder and raft, universally ferrying sentient beings.
Among them, the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness* is truly essential,
The great principle of returning cinnabar made manifest.
What is called purity? Not a speck of dust clings—thus it is pure.
What is called stillness? All conditions cease—thus it is still.
If one can be constantly pure and still, one naturally merges with the mysterious Dao,
Directly transcending to the other shore."*

Alas! Worldly people cling to all manner of appearances, suffering endless afflictions. Though they wish to transcend, even if they delight in this scripture, merely reciting its words, they ultimately fail to awaken to its meaning. Their lives pass in confusion, utterly without attainment.

I once obtained the *Chaptered Corrections of Errors* by the Purple Clarity Perfected Bai, and the *Annotated Exegesis* by Sima Zimei—each word penetrating the subtle, each phrase illuminating the principle. Truly, these are the compass for cultivating the real. Fearing the gradual loss of these texts, I have had them block-printed to broaden their transmission. If one encounters a man with the eye of wisdom, he will be able to see through the mystery, smashing the barriers—how different from parting the clouds to behold the sun, or meeting Laozi face to face? Having reached this point, one forgets both purity and turbidity, movement and stillness become one. In walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—all is purity and stillness. White clouds and flowing water, green mountains and bright moon—even one who tosses back his beard and lets out a long cry does so in purity and stillness. Vivid and free, like a pearl spinning on a plate—how could this be mere stagnation in withered wood and dead ashes?

Thus is the teaching of purity and stillness expounded.
Respectfully inscribed by Wang Daxu of Mount Juqu.

The *Dao De Jing* says:
*"The valley spirit does not die—it is called the mysterious female.
The gate of the mysterious female is called the root of heaven and earth."*
The mysterious female is the unity of yin and yang; yin and yang are the unity of heaven and earth. In the *Book of Changes*, Qian is the "mysterious" heaven, Kun is the "female" earth. By analogy, within the human body—a single heaven and earth—life and kidneys divide left and right into yin and yang: this is the mysterious female of the human being. Between the life-kidneys—is this not its gate? Is this not the root of heaven and earth?

The *Scripture of Purity and Stillness* originally holds that movement and stillness are principle. Bai Yuchan, in his exegesis, placed an illustrated diagram at the front to clarify this meaning. For this scripture is to be realized within the square inch of the heart—it is not mere learning for the mouth and ears.

I have often said that the Confucians speak of nature and life, the Buddhists of embryonic breathing, and the Daoists of the mysterious female—though their names differ, their principle is one. Yet how lamentable that people of this world, under the guise of Confucianism, scheme for advancement; or invoke the words of Buddha and Laozi to delude others with the promise of blessings and merit—could this have been the original intent of those who established these teachings? Seeing Bai Yuchan’s transmission of this scripture and its diagram, one should blush with shame—this is not only for those who follow Laozi.

Wang Dashu and Shi Dawen obtained this scripture and had it block-printed; their aspiration is worthy of esteem. Thus I have written this colophon.
In the first year of the Huangqing era, after the Shangsi festival.
