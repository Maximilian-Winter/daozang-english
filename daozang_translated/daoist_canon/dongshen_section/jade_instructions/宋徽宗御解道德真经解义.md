# 宋徽宗御解道德真经解义

**Preface to the *Exposition on the Dao and Its Virtue* by Emperor Huizong of Song**

I have heard that the Dao cannot be made manifest without words, nor can words convey the Dao without the Classics. The Dao fails to spread because the Classics are not transmitted, and the Classics fail to circulate because their meaning remains obscure.

In the late Zhou, the Dao declined and virtue waned. The various masters arose, each claiming their own heterodoxies as distinct schools. Their clever words and abstruse theories, though vast, could not be used to seek truth. They took turns as the clamor of flutes and drums, flowing into falsehood and deception. Like floating stones and sunken wood, they indulged in perverse doctrines, losing the true nature of life and sinking into ruin, unable to return.

Laozi set forth five thousand words to clarify the constancy of the Dao and virtue, intending to cut off learning and return to simplicity, to restore non-action and stabilize through purity and tranquility—this is the Classic that bears the Dao.

Yet its words are concise and its meaning profound. The more one delves, the more distant it becomes; the more one probes, the deeper it grows. Without divine insight, one cannot even begin to discuss its outline—this is why the Classic is so difficult to transmit.

Our Sovereign, born with innate knowledge, endowed by Heaven with divine sagacity, grasps the subtle words and profound meanings not merely in understanding but in true embodiment. From his imperial brush, he has composed a complete work. Though separated from Laozi by a thousand years of emptiness, his words align as if by tally. The true, constant, and wondrous origin is laid bare and made clear—this is how the Classic is transmitted, its meaning illuminated, and the Dao made to flourish.

I, undeserving of such an encounter, have purified my mind, cleansed my thoughts, and concentrated my spirit to unity. Reverently reading the Sacred Composition, I have pondered deeply and sought its utmost essence. My obscurity and delusion have been suddenly dispelled, as if gaining insight, and I could not restrain myself. Presumptuously offering my humble views, I have looked up to the Sagely Teachings and expounded this *Exposition*, dividing it into ten scrolls.

Though a frog in a well, my knowledge does not reach the clouds; though a firefly’s glow, my light cannot add to the sun and moon. Yet the transformative power of the Dao is vast. Even the smallest creature may express the wonders of Heaven and Earth’s creation, and this is sufficient to manifest the ultimate achievement of the Sagely Governance and the far-reaching influence of the Dao.

To have encountered this once in ten thousand chances is a stroke of fortune. Moreover, it allows all under Heaven and future generations to know that in this era of Great Peace and prosperity, even one of humble station is not dismissed for their words. They will see how the Classic is transmitted and the Dao made to flourish—how could this not be right?

Respectfully inscribed by your servant, Zhang An.

**The Classic of the Dao**

The Imperial Annotation states:
The Dao is that which all people jointly follow.
Virtue is what the heart naturally attains.
The Dao, once established, endures for all ages without corruption.
Virtue fills the constancy of one’s nature and abides forever.

At the end of the Zhou, the Dao declined and virtue waned. Thus, the Old Master composed ninety-nine chapters to clarify the constancy of the Dao and virtue, calling it the *Classic*. Its words are concise, its meaning far-reaching—scholars should silently comprehend and deeply cultivate it.

**My Exposition:**
In the Great Beginning, there was Non-Being; Non-Being had no name, and it was called the Dao.
When the One had yet to take form, yet things received life from it, it was called virtue.
The Dao is fundamentally nameless; to call it the Dao is to speak of what all people jointly follow.
Virtue is fundamentally self-attained; to call it virtue is to speak of what all hearts naturally attain.

Only the Dao is boundless, empty and clear, eternally abiding. Only the Dao is formless, subtle and primordial, eternally real. It transcends the realm of being and non-being, dissolving the dwelling of self and other. In essence, it is essence; in function, it is function. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they do not lie beyond it. Though an autumn hair is minute, it relies on it to complete its form. The beginning and end, exit and entry of the myriad things have never not originated from this—thus it is called the Dao. It is what all hearts naturally and equally attain.

Examining it, it requires no borrowing and does not transform with things. Profound in its abiding, it does not shift with things. Never obscured or diminished, never errant or hasty, the heart is whole with Heaven and free from the burdens of gain and loss—thus it is called virtue.

The Dao is formless; being formless, it is not subject to change or decay, enduring through all ages without corruption.
Virtue resides within me; being within me, it requires nothing external, thus filling the constancy of one’s nature and abiding forever.

When the Zhou declined and culture decayed, the world rushed toward superficialities, multiplying cleverness and intelligence, indulging in benevolence and righteousness. Primal simplicity was daily eroded, unable to achieve sudden clarity and perceive the unique. Lingering in the realm of honor and disgrace, drifting in the arena of likes and dislikes, they came to extinguish Heaven with man, and obliterate life with artifice—what then of the Dao and virtue?

Thus, the Old Master composed ninety-nine chapters to cut off learning and return to simplicity, to restore the discipline of the Dao, and to deepen the root and solidify the foundation, merging with the Great Beginning. By naming the constancy of the Dao, he discussed the primordial mother of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. By observing the constancy of being and non-being, he beheld the subtlest and most refined wonders. Returning to life to embody the spirit, knowing harmony to preserve qi. The Dao is constant and returns to the nameless; virtue is constant and reaches the return to simplicity—all to clarify the constancy of the Dao and virtue.

What is constant and unchanging is called the *Classic* (jing). The weft (wei) interweaves back and forth, thus it is called change. The *Classic* has a fixed essence, the meaning of constancy and enduring permanence. Words express meaning, thus they are called "words" (ci); intent points to meaning, thus it is called "meaning" (zhi). Only words that bear the Dao are concise and fitting. The meaning that embodies the Dao is distant yet clear.

The Dao fundamentally cannot be transmitted through words, nor can it be illustrated through meaning. Seeking it between the traces of words is certainly not the way to attain the Dao. Yet if one clings to the edges of words, the Dao again cannot be captured or described. Only those who merge with the Dao, who unite with the words and meaning beyond, who harmonize with the primordial One and return to true constancy, can silently comprehend and deeply cultivate it.

Alas! The Dao is not distant for those with intent, nor is it near for those without. Silent comprehension and profound attainment—this is called "mystic unity."

**Chapter One: The Dao That Can Be Spoken**
The Dao that can be spoken is not the enduring Dao.
The name that can be named is not the enduring name.

The Imperial Commentary states: "Without beginning is called the Dao; it cannot be spoken, for speech misrepresents it." It further says: "The Dao should not be named." That which can be spoken or named resembles things and affairs, like the four seasons—responding when fitting, alternating in decline and rise, yet not truly constant. The enduring Dao and enduring name are self-originating, self-rooted; before heaven and earth existed, they have ever abided.

Fuxi attained it and inherited the Mother of Qi; the Queen Mother of the West attained it and sat in the Lesser Expanse. None know its beginning, none know its end.

Minister Yi says: The Dao is supremely void, dwelling within the myriad concrete things yet showing no trace of disturbance—thus it has no form to describe. The Dao is supremely still, facing the myriad movements yet untouched by their entanglements—thus it has no direction to name. The Dao cannot be spoken; when entrusted to words and sounds, these are but its dregs. The Dao cannot be named; when lodged within forms and vessels, these are but its traps and snares. That which can be spoken or named belongs to the realm of existence—like things and affairs, ceaseless in their cycles of rise and fall, like the four seasons, endlessly revolving in succession. Adapting to principle and fitting change, each may be deemed fitting in its moment—how could this be truly constant? The wondrous root of true constancy precedes heaven and earth without decay, follows heaven and earth without exhaustion. Mystically uniting in silence, how could it tolerate sound?

Fuxi attained it and inherited the Mother of Qi—this may be called knowing the child while guarding the mother, thus merging with the Dao’s essence. Is this not the enduring Dao? The Queen Mother of the West attained it and sat in the Lesser Expanse—this may be called obtaining the mother to know the child, thus uniting with the Dao’s function. Is this not the enduring name? The enduring Dao and enduring name are self-originating, self-rooted; before heaven and earth existed, they have ever abided—how could one discuss their beginning and end in terms of novelty or antiquity? Thus it is said: none know its end.

**Nameless, it is the beginning of heaven and earth.**
**Named, it is the mother of the myriad things.**

The Imperial Commentary states: The Dao is eternally nameless; even heaven and earth await it to come into being—what *Zhuangzi* calls "giving birth to heaven and earth." Before heaven and earth existed, who could name it? Thus the nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth. Only after heaven and earth exist do the myriad things arise—thus the named is the mother of the myriad things.

Minister Yi says: In the great beginning, there was nonbeing, and nonbeing had no name. Thus the nameless is the inception of qi, that by which heaven and earth are born—hence it is the beginning of heaven and earth. From the One comes naming; the One generates the Two, the Two generates the Three, and the Three generates the myriad things. Thus the named is the origin of number, that by which the myriad things are completed—hence it is the mother of the myriad things. As the inception of qi, it is called "beginning"; as the ceaseless generation of life, it is called "mother."

**By constantly having nothing, one may observe its mystery.**
**By constantly having something, one may observe its manifestations.**

The Imperial Commentary states: *Zhuangzi* says: "Establish it in constant nonbeing and constant being." Not establishing a single thing—this is called constant nonbeing. Not discarding a single thing—this is called constant being. Constant nonbeing resides in principle, transcending all bounds; it is the utmost subtlety of the world—thus one observes its mystery. Constant being resides in affairs, embracing all transformations without confusion; it is the utmost mutability of the world—thus one observes its manifestations. Within the two realms of being and nonbeing, manifestations and mystery reside. Only great wisdom can observe both without obstruction.

In the midst of vagueness and indistinctness, there are images and things. Lesser wisdom, self-serving and partial, fixates on one corner—discarding being to cling to emptiness, pursuing ends while forgetting roots. Thus the Dao’s arts are torn asunder across the world.

Minister Yi says: To be within being yet have nonbeing is called constant nonbeing—not the emptiness of annihilation, but seeing nonbeing within being. Yet all things are empty—thus it is said: "not establishing a single thing," which is the true constancy of nonbeing. To be within nonbeing yet have being is called constant being—not the being of material forms, but seeing being within nonbeing. Yet all things are fully present—thus it is said: "not discarding a single thing," which is the true constancy of being. Constant nonbeing merges with the principle of unity, concealing the world’s utmost subtlety, penetrating right and wrong, blending past and present. Constant nonbeing does not fall into mere nothingness—thus one may observe its mystery. Constant being responds to the affairs of the present, facing the world’s utmost transformations—things and events in ceaseless cycles, forms and vessels in endless flux, emerging in infinite variety, chaotic and unceasing. Constant being does not stagnate in mere existence—thus one may observe its manifestations. Within the realm of being and nonbeing, the observation of manifestations and mystery resides. Yet how could manifestations and mystery be fully observed through being and nonbeing alone? It is rather by means of constant nonbeing and constant being that one seeks to observe them.

These two emerge from the same source yet bear different names—together they are called the Mysterious.

The Imperial Commentary states: The Dao is originally without form—what could be its manifestations or mystery? Self and other share the same root; right and wrong are of one qi—thus together they are called the Mysterious. The deluded of the world abandon the false to seek the real, yet the more they distance themselves from the real, the less they understand that being and nonbeing are but different names.

Minister Yi says: The Dao takes constant nonbeing as its essence and wondrous being as its function. Treasuring its formless nature, who could observe its manifestations or mystery? Self and other return to the origin of creation; right and wrong merge in the qi of emptiness. Detached from form and free of intellect, being and nonbeing both vanish—thus together they are called the Mysterious. To be within nonbeing yet have being, to be within being yet have nonbeing—this is what is meant by "these two emerge from the same source." Being and nonbeing generate each other, yet their distinctions become apparent—this is why they bear different names.

The Mysterious as color is both red and black—terms like "the first day of the north" in its direction all unite these two aspects. Only by penetrating both being and nonbeing to unite them as one can one speak of the Dao.

"Mysterious and yet again mysterious"—this is the gate of all wonders.

The Imperial Commentary states: *The Plain Questions* says, "The Mysterious gives birth to spirit." *The Book of Changes* says, "Spirit is that which wondrously brings forth the myriad things." What is wondrous and subtle is called the Mysterious; the Mysterious is the color of Heaven. That which is colored by color is manifest, yet that which colors all colors has never been revealed. "Mysterious and yet again mysterious"—this refers to that which colors all colors. The principle of the Mysterious and wondrous is inherent in all things. What moves Heaven, what stabilizes Earth, what makes humans numinous, what makes the hundred things flourish—all are wondrous, and all emerge from the Mysterious. Thus it is called "the gate of all wonders." When Confucius composed the *Book of Changes*, he first spoke of wonder in the "Discussion of the Trigrams," while Laozi placed it at the beginning of his work. The words of the sages form a continuous cycle.

Minister Yi says: Heaven originates its unity in the north—this is the sameness of the Mysterious. Earth pairs its duality in the south—this is the emergence of spirit. Spirit is born from the Mysterious, and the Mysterious is wondrous through spirit. Together with being and nonbeing, they merge without distinction—this is what is called the Mysterious. "Mysterious and yet again mysterious"—the Mysterious reaches its utmost here. Spirit emerges from this, numinosity becomes manifest through this, wondrously bringing forth the myriad things without fixed form. This is how Heaven and Earth attain their divine clarity, and how the sage accomplishes effortless action. The numinosity of humans and the flourishing of things all fulfill their wonder, and all wonder emerges from the Mysterious. Thus it is called "the gate of all wonders." When Confucius composed the *Book of Changes*, he used images and numbers to reveal spirit, so he first spoke of wonder in the "Discussion of the Trigrams." Laozi united being and nonbeing to reveal the Mysterious, so he placed it at the beginning of his work. Spirit is born from the Mysterious, and the Mysterious is the source from which all wonders emerge—thus the sequence begins and ends in this way.

**Chapter Two: When All Under Heaven Know**

When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises. When all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises.

The Imperial Commentary states: The Dao has no distinct forms—what is beauty, what is ugliness? Nature is originally one—what is good, what is not? Where there is beauty, ugliness stands in opposition, thus: "When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises." Where there is goodness, not-goodness stands in opposition, thus: "When all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises." What the world considers beautiful is called the divine and marvelous; what it considers ugly is called the foul and rotten. Yet the divine and marvelous may transform into the foul and rotten, and the foul and rotten may transform into the divine and marvelous—how then can beauty and ugliness be distinguished? What was once deemed right may now be rejected, and what is now discarded may later be used—how then can good and not-good be chosen? The sage embodies true nonbeing yet is constantly present, wields wondrous function yet remains nonbeing. Beauty and ugliness, good and not-good—these he simplifies yet cannot grasp. How then could ugliness and not-goodness ever burden him?

Minister Yi says: The Dao is originally without thing—what distinct forms could it have? Yet when it enters the realm of beauty and ugliness, distinctions arise. Nature is originally one in the Mysterious—what duality could it possess? Yet when it adheres to good and not-good, its manifestations diverge. The ancients returned to the origin of the Dao, obscured in celestial nature, content in their natural state, each at ease with what they attained, each acting spontaneously in what was fitting. How could they be said to act? But when the pure and simple scattered, they turned from the Dao toward things, abandoned nature for the heart-mind, used the heart-mind to know, and followed emotions to seek harmony. Disregarding nature and destiny, they were swept away by private desires. Thus beauty and ugliness, good and not-good, alternated in opposition—how could this ever end? The divine and marvelous or the foul and rotten in things depend on the world’s judgments of beauty and ugliness. As transformations shift, what is fitting is prized—how then can beauty and ugliness truly be distinguished? The right and wrong, use and discard of principles depend on the world’s judgments of good and not-good. In the interplay of subtle changes, what accords with the time is deemed proper—how then can good and not-good truly be chosen? Moreover, as emotions manifest, people’s knowledge differs; each follows their private interests, creating self and other. Thus beauty and ugliness, good and not-good, cycle endlessly. The sage transcends self and other in the unity of the Mysterious, dissolves being and nonbeing together, leaves behind oppositions to abide in solitude—no words can describe it. When Ji Xian appeared divine, yet Master Hu could not fathom him, how could beauty and ugliness, good and not-good ever burden him? When the Mysterious Pearl was lost, and knowledge was sent to seek it in vain—what further use was there for knowledge?

Being and nonbeing give birth to each other; difficulty and ease complete each other; long and short form each other; high and low incline toward each other; sound and echo harmonize with each other; front and back follow each other.

The Imperial Commentary states: Before the Great Primal separated, the ten thousand images shared a single body. Once the Two Modes emerged, each thing stood in opposition. These six pairs are where all transformations intersect, where a hundred thoughts arise, where divergent paths begin—this is how the world’s people become mired and cannot free themselves. Nonbeing moves to generate being, and being returns to nonbeing—thus "being and nonbeing give birth to each other." When one encounters perilous difficulty, one knows the ease of level ground—thus "difficulty and ease complete each other." Long and short form each other, as with a foot and an inch. High and low incline toward each other, as with mountains and marshes. When sound is raised, echo responds—thus "sound and echo harmonize with each other." When form moves, shadow follows—thus "front and back follow each other." The movement of yin and yang, the progression of the four seasons, the principles of the myriad things—suddenly they come into being, swiftly they transform into nonbeing. Their difficulty lies in acting to order the world; their ease lies in non-action to suit oneself. What is long by nature cannot be cut short; what is short by nature cannot be extended. Heaven is high of itself; Earth is low of itself. Strike the *gong* note, and the *gong* note resonates; strike the *jue* note, and the *jue* note responds. Spring leads, and summer follows; the elder leads, and the younger follows. Though these paired conditions all dwell within the Dao, they are far from the Dao.

Minister Yi states: Qi is that which the Dao moves. Things are that which qi transforms. Qi is obscure in nonbeing, empty yet ever-permeating; when it becomes manifest, it is grasped and imaged—hence called "image." It unfolds the Dao in the Great Simplicity, whence arises the image of the Lord, bestowing qi upon the myriad things through nonbeing, completing their forms through being. Qi disperses in the Grand Beginning, becoming yin and yang; forms separate in the Primordial Inception, becoming heaven and earth. At the extreme of qi’s transformations, where forms are transmuted—mountains’ stillness, seas and rivers’ flow, the manifest utility of the Five Materials, the names and terms of the host of things—their principles, their forms, their sounds, their numbers, their flowing, scattering, and shifting, their entry and exit into life and death—all that dwells within the realm of form and vessel: these six pairs emerge and submerge in alternation, yet cannot halt of themselves. People of the world grasp them as real, engage with them as constructs, take the illusory as constant, and so cut and wound one another in mutual harm, erode and dissolve one another in mutual decay. Weary and toiling, they know not where to return, thus sinking into the current of ceaseless flux, unable to extricate themselves.

All under heaven that can be named has never been without its counterpart: being and nonbeing, difficulty and ease, long and short, high and low, the harmony of sound and echo, the following of front and back—all are the necessary principles of their nature. All under heaven that can be named is invariably thus, never standing alone. Hence, from beauty arises ugliness, from goodness arises not-goodness—this is the inherent pattern. Though these six paired conditions all dwell within the Dao, serving as the lodging of its wondrous function, when enslaved to their entanglements and driven by their impulses, they depart from the Dao—one may say they are far indeed. How then can one speak of the Dao?

Thus the sage abides in non-action, practices the teaching without words. As the *Yuzhu* notes: "Abiding in non-action" is what *Zhuangzi* calls "using the world through non-action." "Practicing the teaching without words" is what the *Yi* calls "establishing teaching through the spirit-way, and the world submits." To act is to incur completion and loss; to speak is to risk rightness and error—how can one escape entanglement? How could this be the way the sage stands alone above the myriad things, transforming them while remaining unburdened by them?

Minister Yi states: When affairs arise, I respond to them—this cannot be avoided. Yet when seen as action, principle incurs completion and loss. When things arrive unexpectedly, I discern them—this cannot be without speech. Yet when seen as speech, principle incurs rightness and error. Entering the realm of action and speech—who can forget entanglement? The sage stands alone above the myriad things; where affairs are handled and teaching is practiced, the world thereby returns to constancy and restores simplicity. Mysteriously uniting right and wrong, he makes no distinction between beauty and ugliness, goodness and not-goodness. Those six pairs have no means to disturb—thus he has never been burdened by speech or action.

The myriad things arise, yet he does not refuse; they live, yet he does not possess; he acts, yet does not rely; his work is accomplished, yet he does not dwell. This may be called "using the world through non-action." Hence it is said: "Abide in non-action." He does not esteem worthies, does not prize rare goods, does not display what may be desired—this may be called "establishing teaching through the spirit-way, and the world submits." Hence it is said: "Practice the teaching without words." The myriad things arise, yet he does not refuse; they live, yet he does not possess; he acts, yet does not rely; his work is accomplished, yet he does not dwell. Only because he does not dwell does he not depart.

As the *Yuzhu* notes: The myriad things arise together, and he responds to their stimuli as a mirror reflects forms—beauty and ugliness are fully revealed; as an echo answers a valley—good and bad all arrive, with nothing refused. Hence it is said: "They arise, yet he does not refuse." They form and transform themselves, live and take on color themselves, each reaching its utmost height and greatness, each fulfilling its nature—who possesses them? Hence it is said: "They live, yet he does not possess." He orders the myriad things without cruelty, bestows blessings for ten thousand generations without claiming benevolence, covers and bears heaven and earth, carves and shapes all forms without claiming skill. Hence it is said: "He acts, yet does not rely." The movement of the four seasons—when their work is complete, they depart: this is the Way of Heaven. The sage embodies this, thus his merit covers the world, yet seems not to originate from himself. To grasp and claim it is already delusion. Hence it is said: "His work is accomplished, yet he does not dwell." To dwell is to depart—this is true of past and present. With nothing dwelling in himself, nothing can move him. Coming as it comes, going as it goes—what is added or diminished? Hence it is said: "Only because he does not dwell does he not depart."

Minister Yi states: The sage moves only when pressed, rises only when unavoidable—thus he does not engage in busyness. When things come, he responds; responding without exhaustion, he is not entangled in the moment, nor does he cling to the past. Following the times and riding the principle, he adapts to change as it suits, like heaven’s cycling of cold and heat, entrusted to nature, his heart free of accumulated grievances or scheming thoughts.

When the myriad things arise together, they arise of themselves—what need is there for refusal? Responding to stimuli without premeditation—what room is there for intention? Like a mirror facing forms, he neither sends forth nor welcomes, responds yet does not store. Like a valley echoing sound, he neither amplifies nor suppresses, leaving nothing large or small unanswered. Hence it is said: "The myriad things arise, yet he does not refuse."

The movement of the single qi, the molding of the great craft—its generation proceeds in order, its beginning and end in sequence. Movement and stillness, speech and silence, are driven by the workings of heaven’s mechanism; spirit and heart’s guard sprout from the qi’s dynamic. Heaven bestows form, scattering it into ten thousand differences—its transformations vary, its lives are not uniform, its bodies differ, its colors diverge. Each reaches its limit and fulfills its nature, yet none knows how this comes to be. To grasp and claim it—who could give life to life? Hence it is said: "They live, yet he does not possess."

Acting through non-action, though he acts—what does he rely on?

Success is achieved through heaven’s work—yet though achieved, what claim do I have?
To claim is to possess; when nothing is possessed within oneself, nothing can sway one. To possess is to drift and wander without constancy.

Thus it is said: "He acts yet does not rely; he succeeds yet does not claim." To claim and possess—this the world does not grant. Not to claim yet possess—this the world does not take away. Hence it is said: "Only by not claiming does one not lose."

**Chapter Three: Not Exalting the Worthy**

Not exalting the worthy causes the people not to contend.
Not prizing rare goods causes the people not to steal.

The *Imperial Commentary* says: Exalting the worthy breeds cunning, leading to great turmoil throughout the world, where Confucians and Mohists all arise. Prizing goods breeds desire, leading to theft in broad daylight and burrowing through walls at noon.

Not exalting the worthy allows each person to settle into their allotted nature and destiny, with no cause for overreaching—hence it is said, "they do not contend." Not prizing goods allows each person to rest in the truth of their nature and destiny, with no cause for covetousness—hence it is said, "they do not steal."

*Zhuangzi* says: "Shave away the conduct of Zeng and Shi, silence the mouths of Yang and Mo, and the world’s virtue will begin to attain profound unity."

*The Canons of Lü* says: "Do not prize exotic things; value useful things, and the people will be sufficient."

Minister Yi says: When the sage governs the world with indulgent freedom, he extinguishes the heart of predation and advances the solitary will. Thus, nature is rectified and does not flow astray; emotions are guarded and do not run wild. Resting in nature, one comes to share the Dao; mastering emotions, one comes to share heaven’s principle. Thus, one returns joyfully to the realm of self-attainment, delighting in the domain of non-action.

After the Three Dynasties, the Dao was insufficient to overcome desire, stillness insufficient to restrain movement. People rubbed against honor and disgrace on the path of profit and loss, pursued extravagance beyond the bounds of form. Thus, the noble clung to the Dao and grasped at being, boasted of virtuous conduct, and admired those who forgot themselves. The petty turned their backs on the Dao and raced away, peddled prized goods, and pursued profit at the cost of their lives.

They exalted worthiness and despised those who did not measure up; I, seeing their superiority, resented my own failure to surpass them—this is how contention arises. They prized goods and surpassed what I lacked; I, seeing their pride, envied what they possessed—this is how theft arises. Thus, fame is the root of contention, and profit the origin of theft.

Those drawn to fame lose themselves in external pursuits; those addicted to profit perish in chasing after ends. Therefore, not exalting the worthy leaves the people without boastful ambition; not prizing goods leaves the people without covetous desire. When the heart of overreaching is forgotten, what contention can there be? When the hope of covetousness ceases, what theft can there be?

Shave away the conduct of Zeng and Shi, silence the mouths of Yang and Mo—then words and deeds will not stand, right and wrong will both vanish, and virtue will return to its original unity. Hence it is said: "Not exalting the worthy causes the people not to contend." Not prizing exotic things keeps the people from losing their constancy; not devaluing useful things keeps the people from turning from their roots—thus the people are sufficient. When the people are sufficient, they do not steal. Hence it is said: "Not prizing rare goods causes the people not to steal."

**Not Displaying Desirable Things**

Not displaying what may be desired keeps the heart from disorder.

The *Imperial Commentary* says: When people have desires, they follow the impulses of their nature and destiny to contend for them, leading to usurpation, deceit, and every kind of excess. Boyi saw fame as desirable and starved beneath Mount Shouyang. Robber Zhi saw profit as desirable and raged atop Dongling. Their heat scorched like fire, their cold congealed like ice—thus their hearts were disordered by passion and pride, and could not be bound to the Dao.

As for the sage, he does not seek profit, does not shun harm, does not rejoice in long life, does not grieve over early death, does not take glory in success, does not feel shame in poverty—what, then, is desirable? With no desires stirring, his heart is serene. When moved, he responds; when at rest, he is unobstructed. In action, he is not driven—who could disorder him?

Confucius was free from doubt at forty; Mencius said, "At forty, my heart did not waver." Minister Yi says: Abiding in stillness without change, one returns to the obscurity of unified virtue, merging with the Great Beginning. Spirit congeals in the Great Void; qi is preserved in harmonious emptiness. Seeing the things of the world, one deems them insufficient to shake one’s celestial abode—thus the heart rests in tranquility.

Those who are benighted engage in the five senses’ mutual strife, where likes and dislikes agitate their emotions; the six apertures contend, and the impulse to grasp and discard flows into falsity. The eyes’ deluded seeing, the mind’s deluded desires—daily they battle the heart in the space of encounter and construction. Thus the heart is confounded, and heavenly principle departs.

Boyi and Robber Zhi died by starvation and violence because they saw fame and profit as desirable. Scorched by fire’s heat, frozen by ice’s cold, they sought after gain and loss—so confounded and disordered, they were seized by what was desirable. Confucius’ freedom from doubt, Mencius’ unwavering heart—they knew there was nothing desirable, hence no doubt, no wavering. What disorder could there be?

Thus the sage’s governance empties the heart, fills the belly, weakens the will, and strengthens the bones, ever keeping the people without knowledge and without desire.

The *Imperial Commentary* says: The valley is receptive because it is empty; the mirror reflects because it is empty; the pipe and lock receive because they are empty; the ear hears because it is empty; the eye sees because it is empty; the nose smells because it is empty. If something is full within, it obstructs these functions.

The sage, compelled to oversee the world, regards all with impartial benevolence, values the near and raises the distant, follows what is inherently so, and leaves things to themselves—what room is there for personal intent? Yao’s elevation of Shun and employment of Gun were nearly sufficient.

With an empty heart, one listens and observes impartially, without the emotions of like and dislike. With a full belly, one is content and at peace, without the will to covet—how could worthiness be exalted, or goods be prized? The sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes—the belly accepts without discrimination.

The will is the direction of the heart; the bones are the foundation of the body. When the will is strong, one may pursue fame heedlessly or chase wealth insatiably, boast of achievements, or vaunt one’s abilities—ever farther from the Dao. When the bones are weak, conduct drifts and shifts, clashing and yielding with things, sinking together into dissolution without return.

The sage’s will always humbles itself, yet others exalt it; always stays behind, yet others place it first. Knowing the male, he keeps to the female; knowing glory, he keeps to disgrace—this is called weakening the will. By rectitude he halts it, and the myriad things cannot sway him; by firmness he holds it, and the ten thousand changes cannot topple him. The unchanging appearance, like that of Guangchengzi, who lived twelve hundred years without his form ever declining—this is called strengthening the bones.

*Zhuangzi* says: “In accord with non-knowing, one’s virtue does not depart; in accord with non-desire, this is called plain simplicity. When plain simplicity is attained, the people’s nature is preserved.” The sage’s governance aims only to let the people preserve their nature. Much knowledge harms the allotment of life and fate; many desires muddy the feelings of life and fate. To call this “governance” is to invite chaos—what could be worse? Thus, he constantly ensures the people remain without knowledge and without desire.

Minister Yi says: The Dao is stored in nothingness, so emptiness is the Dao’s counterpart. Things are burdened by being, so fullness is the accumulation of things. Man opens his Heavenly nature, and things bore holes in his desires. Those with form are enslaved by form; those with a heart are driven by the heart. When private desires prevail within and external things seize without, yin and yang contend in mutual support, and Heavenly harmony is lost in mutual ruin. The numinous terrace, the chamber of Great Emptiness, is already choked within—when things come, they merely pass through their old patterns and respond to their stimuli. How could this not be a grave error?

The valley is empty, so it echoes sounds from all directions; the mirror is empty, so it reflects forms without limit; the flute and pipe are empty, so they can receive the qi of emptiness. How much more so the heart, which governs the five senses and presides over the ten thousand virtues? It responds to stimuli and does not hoard—its essence lies in emptiness. Only emptiness returns to the absence of things, unites with the beginningless—this is called embracing simplicity. Embracing this is called guarding the One. Guarding this, Yanzi advanced in this way.

Unifying the heart to attain the One, attaining the One to gather emptiness, entering and roaming its bounds, reaching the state before the first turning—then one can fulfill one’s nature and leave no lingering emotions of love or hate. Following what is inherently so and leaving things to themselves—this is because the heart is empty. Obscuring right and wrong, unifying likes and dislikes, forgetting the dusty burdens, the heart becomes empty.

When Yao elevated Shun and employed Gun, what personal intent did he harbor? He responded with emptiness—what burden of likes and dislikes could there be? The belly, as a thing, contains without discrimination, receives without filling. The qi’s course, the transformations of things, all return to it. Inhalation and exhalation, beginning and end—there is no limit, never any sufficiency. Beset by insufficiency, one cannot but seek; unceasing seeking leads to peril. Thus, the belly must be full. Fullness brings contentment and peace, with nothing to await from without. The impulse for demands vanishes, and the blessing of tranquility arrives—what room is there for thoughts of profit or desire? The burden of likes and dislikes is gone—how could worthiness be exalted? The thought of profit and desire is extinguished—how could goods be prized?

The will is the heart’s direction. When the will is strong, its orientation knows no bounds—it wearies in scheming, exhausts the spirit, toils the thoughts, chases fame and wealth, boasts of achievements, vaunts abilities—when will it ever cease? Thus, the will must be weakened, turning from activity to stillness, from being to non-being. Keeping to the female to return to non-action, keeping to disgrace to rest in one’s allotted place—humbling oneself without seeking elevation, staying behind without seeking precedence, seeking to return to the Dao—this is called weakening the will.

The body’s foundation lies in the bones. When the bones are weak, one loses oneself to things, drifting with changes, following others’ comings and goings in conduct, clinging to others’ likes and dislikes in use and discard, clashing and yielding with things without knowing one’s error, sinking with things without knowing how to return. Unable to stand on one’s own, it comes to this. Thus, the bones must be strong. Strength brings independence and constancy, standing alone and having attainment, preserving Heaven’s guard without being swayed by things, completing Heaven’s firmness without being lost to others. Its movement is not perilous, its conduct is vigorous, its strength unceasing, daily advancing in the Dao—this is called strengthening the bones.

The sage governs his heart with emptiness, leaving nothing to divide; his belly is full, leaving nothing to seek; his will is weak, leaving no external pursuits; his bones are strong, leaving no sway by things. This is how he ensures the people remain without knowledge and unburdened by fame, without desire and unburdened by profit, preserving their carefree wandering in the realm of inherent attainment—thus returning to plain simplicity.

Knowledge means the heart is enslaved by things, so much knowledge harms the allotment of life and fate. Desires mean the emotions are swayed by things, so many desires muddy the feelings of life and fate. Returning to non-knowing, one does not use knowledge; reverting to non-desire, one does not see what can be desired. The essence lies in constancy—thus it is said: “Constantly ensure the people remain without knowledge and without desire.” This is to make those with knowledge dare not act.

The *Imperial Commentary* says: Those skilled in debate dare not gallop their words; the brave dare not flaunt their prowess; the capable dare not vaunt their talents; the wise dare not display their discernment. Creating cleverness, boasting of cunning, multiplying laws and decrees to overawe the multitude—these the sage all forbids and halts. This is what is meant by “making those with knowledge dare not act.” The nine offices all attend to their duties, and the worthy submit—how could knowledge be used to bore holes?

Executing the ruler’s commands, one merely conveys them to the people.

*Ministerial Exegesis* says: In the sage’s governance, he abides in non-action and practices wordless instruction. Above, he embraces the Dao to grant the world its freedom; below, he transforms and perfects through the Dao. The people, though possessed of much knowledge, revert to non-knowing; though possessed of many desires, revert to non-desire. The ultimate of perfect governance is a return to the Great Antiquity—this may be called perfection. Even those with knowledge, though their words be ready, their courage steadfast, their talents capable, their discernment keen—where could they apply them? They call themselves wise, yet how dare they act? To act is to fail; where could such action find a place? Thus it is said: “they dare not act.” By acting through non-action, there is nothing that is not governed.

The *Imperial Commentary* says: Does the sage’s governance abandon people and sever ties with things, standing aloof in a realm of no affairs? It is merely that his action arises from non-action. The myriad things’ transformations lie below form; the sage embodies the Dao, standing above the ten thousand things, comprehending their inherent principles to govern them. When things arise, he follows them to observe their return. When things are born, he accords with them to bring them to completion—how could there be anything not governed? Thus, when governance is perfected above, the sun, moon, and stars maintain their order; when governance is perfected below, birds, beasts, grasses, and trees fulfill their natures.

*Ministerial Exegesis* says: The sage roams the human world, responding to emperors and kings, yet stands above affairs. In transforming the people and shaping customs, he aims to restore their nature and return to simplicity—how could he be aloof in non-action? His action arises from non-action, yet it is not mere non-action. He assists the naturalness of the ten thousand things, letting them grow as they grow, come to completion as they complete themselves. Curving to preserve Heaven’s wholeness, without the calamities of obstruction or constraint—there is nothing not governed. The sun, moon, and stars maintain their order: this is governance above. Birds, beasts, grasses, and trees fulfill their natures: this is governance below. When governance above and below is thus, the people reach a state of non-knowing and non-desire, and even the knowledgeable dare not act—such is the perfection of governance.

**Chapter Four: The Dao’s Depth**
The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.

The *Imperial Commentary* says: The Dao has essence and reliability, hence it has use; it is formless and without action, hence it does not overflow. The *Classic* says: “The ten thousand things bear yin and embrace yang, blending qi to achieve harmony.” In the principles of things, leaning toward yang leads to strength, but may err through excess; leaning toward yin leads to weakness, but may err through insufficiency. Without excess or insufficiency—this is called “blending qi.” “Blending” means the center, which is called “Great Harmony.” The high are restrained, the low are raised; the excessive are diminished, the insufficient are supplemented. The Dao’s use finds the center in every situation. Poured into yet never full, drawn from yet never exhausted—giving to others, one’s own abundance increases; bestowing upon others, one’s own wealth multiplies. The Dao’s essence resembles the Great Void, enveloping the six directions—how could it overflow?

*Ministerial Exegesis* says: The Dao is concealed before the Great Simplicity. As qi, it has not yet appeared; as form, it has not yet divided; as substance, it has not yet separated—what could be its essence? If even its essence is absent, what could be its use? Yet when the pivot of the Dao turns, the mechanism of Heaven unfolds: yin and yang, as qi, are subtly present in non-being; the ten thousand things, as form, manifest in being. In their endings and beginnings, their goings and comings, all have use, yet none know why it is so. Such is the Dao’s use—filling all without boundary, its responses boundless, nourishing the ten thousand things without exhaustion. Such is the Dao’s non-overflowing. It has essence and reliability, yet these do not depart from the mind—this is called “use,” for there is that which employs it. The Dao takes non-mind as its mind; those qualities of essence and reliability, in use, become its use. Thus it is said: “the Dao’s use.” Formless and without action, it does not fall into being—this is called “non-overflowing,” for it does not cling to vessels. The Dao takes wondrous being as being; those qualities of form, in essence, become its essence. Thus it is non-overflowing. Qi disperses in the Great Beginning, dividing into yin and yang. Thus qi is what the Dao moves, and things are what qi transforms. Those bound by number cannot escape the mechanism of yin and yang; those confined by form cannot transcend the creation of yin and yang. Thus yin and yang are what the ten thousand things bear and embrace, yet they have never been separate. Leaning toward yang leads to excess and strength; leaning toward yin leads to insufficiency and weakness. Using strength, its hardness will surely break; using weakness, its softness will surely fail. “Blending” is the Dao’s manifestation in qi. When qi is balanced, harmony is blending. Interpenetrating, they achieve harmony; intertwining, they become one. The use of hardness and softness knows no excess or insufficiency; the changes of coming and going know no discord. The two merge as one, attaining Great Harmony—there is nowhere it does not reach the center. Such is the use of blending. Blending and using it resembles the Great Void, filling the six directions, enveloping Heaven and Earth, its measure inexhaustible, its responses unceasing. High without above, vast without limit, deep without below, unfathomable without measure—how could it overflow?

The *Imperial Commentary* says: *Zhuangzi* says: “The stillness of deep pools is called a gulf; the stillness of still water is called a gulf; the stillness of flowing water is called a gulf.” A gulf is empty and still, unmingled with things—this is the Dao’s essence. Only because it is empty do all realities return to it; only because it is still do all movements belong to it. It is what the ten thousand things are tied to, what the single transformation awaits. Thus it is said: “resembles the ancestor of the ten thousand things.” Yet the Dao is originally without ties; things naturally take it as their ancestor—thus it is only “resembles.”

*Ministerial Exegesis* says: A gulf is still and unified, yet flowing and returning; empty and unified, yet deep in essence.

The return of the Dao is unmingled with things; its depth is unfathomable by them. Roaming at the origin of things, it merges with the Great Void—this is the essence of the Dao. All things are born of the Dao, thus the Dao is the root and ancestor of the ten thousand things.

The reality of all existence returns to perfect emptiness; the movement of all existence belongs to perfect stillness. Only through emptiness and stillness are the ten thousand beings encompassed, and the great transformation made wondrous.

Things take the Dao as their ancestor, yet the Dao never sets itself up as their ancestor—things naturally take it as such. Thus it is said: “resembles.”

Blunt its sharpness, untangle its tangles, soften its brilliance, merge with its dust.

The *Imperial Commentary* says: Sharpness wounds, tangles confuse. Blunting sharpness prevents contention; untangling tangles prevents disorder. Softening its brilliance is what *Zhuangzi* calls “shining yet not dazzling.” Merging with its dust is what *Zhuangzi* calls “flowing with things and moving with their waves.”

If inner sincerity remains unbroken, the form’s plans become radiant—so much so that those who lodge with one rise from their mats in deference. Is this not what “softening its brilliance” means? Adorning wisdom to startle the foolish, cultivating the self to expose others’ filth, shining forth like a banner, striding like the sun and moon—is this not what “merging with its dust” means?

When the sage blunts sharpness, he dwells among things without harming them, and nothing can harm him. When he untangles tangles, why would he scheme? Why would he cling? Nothing in the world can disturb his heart. Thus he shows no arrogance in countenance, no haughtiness in bearing. Harmonious yet not drifting, he merges with things, opening the minds of all under heaven. There is nowhere he enters and does not find himself at ease.

The *Ministerial Exegesis* says: Sharpness is the edge of things; tangles are the entanglements of affairs. If sharpness is not blunted, its edge will wound. If tangles are not untangled, their entanglements will confuse. Wounding leads to contention; confusion leads to disorder. Thus, blunting sharpness allows one to remain whole within Heaven; untangling tangles allows one to observe their return with clarity.

When the form’s plans become radiant, when the self is cultivated to expose filth, the self has not yet been forgotten. Establishing the self as a burden is far from the Dao. Shining yet not dazzling means one’s brilliance harmonizes with things without discord. Flowing with things and moving with their waves means one’s dust merges with things without distinction. At this stage, emotional attachments are entirely forgotten, self and other become mysteriously one. Distinctions between this and that vanish, and there is nowhere one enters without finding ease.

"Abysmal, as if it might exist."
The *Imperial Commentary* says: The heart is like dead ashes, the body like a withered tree’s branch. In perfect tranquility, the light of Heaven shines of itself. Dimly, as if vanished yet present; effortlessly, without form yet spiritually manifest—is this not the Dao?

The *Ministerial Exegesis* says: Concealing the Dao’s profundity without revealing it, sealing the mechanism of virtue without activating it, returning to non-action, roaming at the origin of things—the heart is like dead ashes, the body like a withered tree, yet the essence merges with the Great Void. Profound and obscure, faintly discernible, as if something were there—this is what Wenbo Xuezi grasped in an instant of perception. Vanished yet present, formless yet spiritually manifest—such is the divine understanding of the great sage, beyond all description.

Those who study the Dao study this; those who transmit the Dao transmit this.

"I do not know whose child it is—it seems to have existed before the Ancestor of Images."
The *Imperial Commentary* says: *Images* are the first appearances of things. *The Ancestor* is the spirit’s response to things. After things are born, images appear; after the Ancestor emerges, things are wondrously transformed. The Ancestor of Images is the beginning of all things, yet the Dao truly precedes it. This is what *Zhuangzi* calls “spiritualizing ghosts and gods, giving birth to Heaven and Earth.”

Invisible, inaudible, intangible—it emerges yet no one sees its gate. Who knows it? Thus it is said: “I do not know whose child it is—it seems to have existed before the Ancestor of Images.”

The *Ministerial Exegesis* says: All that moves from non-being to being is attached to things, thus all things are born of the Dao. All that moves from being to non-being returns to the Dao, thus the Dao is the ancestor of the ten thousand things. The Dao originates from non-being—from what could it be born? Thus it is said: “I do not know whose child it is.” Things belong to being and are born of the Dao, thus it is said: “it seems to have existed before the Ancestor of Images.”

When things appear as images, *images* mark their beginning. When spirit responds to things, *the Ancestor* marks their beginning. Images and the Ancestor are the beginnings of all things, yet both originate from the Dao. Thus it is said: “it seems to have existed before the Ancestor of Images.”

**Exegesis by Gentleman-Official Zhang An**

**The Dao Scripture, Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth**

"Heaven and earth are not benevolent;
they regard the ten thousand things as straw dogs.
The sage is not benevolent;
he regards the hundred clans as straw dogs."

*Imperial Commentary* states: Favor gives rise to harm, and harm gives rise to favor. To take benevolence as favor is to invite harm in its wake. Heaven and earth, in their relation to the ten thousand things, and the sage, in his relation to the hundred clans, assist their natural course without any mind of love or benefit—thus benevolence cannot be named in this.

Straw dogs, bound for sacrificial use, are employed when needed and discarded when their purpose is past. As for the self-arising of the ten thousand things and the self-governing of the hundred clans, how could there be any room for deliberate intent?

*Minister’s Exegesis* states: Great benevolence is not benevolent—not that it is truly without benevolence, but to take benevolence as favor is to make it shallow. With harm following so closely, can benevolence be relied upon? In the age of the Great Dao, all things arise spontaneously, all attain their due—what need is there for benevolence?

Heaven and earth feel no love for things, yet things fulfill their allotted portion and thus share in spontaneous attainment. The sage feels no love for the hundred clans, yet the hundred clans find their own harmony and forget one another in the absence of emotion—this is why heaven and earth and the sage regard the ten thousand things and the hundred clans as straw dogs.

Heaven and earth, in their relation to things, and the sage, in his relation to the people, are neither without mind nor with mind. They allow things to arise as they naturally arise, to be governed as they naturally govern. They respond to the moment and employ what is fitting, yet their employment does not hoard. When the task is done, they set it aside, and their setting aside does not linger—how could there be room for deliberate intent? All is but the assistance of the natural.

"Between heaven and earth, is it not like a bellows?"
*Imperial Commentary* states: The bellows is empty yet able to receive; having received, it is able to respond. Thus it responds without exhaustion. If it were filled with something solid, it would be obstructed at every turn—this would be a partiality in the Dao, a one-sidedness in things.

*Minister’s Exegesis* states: Between heaven and earth, the movement of the single qi opens and closes, transforms, enters and exits, moves and rests—no trace of old or new, no beginning or end. Is it not like a bellows?

The bellows, as a thing, receives because of its emptiness, and its reception does not refuse. It responds because of its emptiness, and its response does not exhaust. If it were filled with something solid, its use would cease.

Heaven and earth animate the ten thousand things—how could they have a mind? Things move of themselves in perfect emptiness, and heaven and earth allow them to be thus. The sage, in his relation to the hundred clans, responds to their spontaneity without entanglement—thus he is compared to a discarded bellows:

"Empty yet inexhaustible,
the more it moves, the more it yields."

*Imperial Commentary* states: To empty oneself and wander through the world is to respond freely and meet every circumstance—thus it is said, "empty yet inexhaustible." Pressed to act, one’s capacity is deployed without depletion—thus it is said, "the more it moves, the more it yields." This is how the sage emerges to respond to emperors and kings without being burdened by words.

*Minister’s Exegesis* states: The qi dwelling in the bellows animates the ten thousand things because the bellows, being empty, can receive and respond. In stillness, it is empty, and qi returns to nothingness without ever being exhausted. In movement, it is empty, and qi responds to being without ever being depleted.

The sage empties himself and responds freely, meeting every circumstance without his Dao being exhausted. In dynamic transformation, his capacity is deployed without depletion, and his Dao ever unfolds—how could words be a burden?

"Much speech leads to frequent exhaustion;
it is better to guard the center."

*Imperial Commentary* states: The bellows waits in emptiness for qi; when qi arrives, it sounds, and when qi does not arrive, it rests. The sage’s words are like this. The confines of the disputatious are such that many words inevitably lead to entanglement—it is better to guard the center.

Be cautious within, close off without, withdraw your vision and reverse your hearing. Return thus to perceive the heart-mind of heaven and earth—this is called "guarding the center."

*Minister’s Exegesis* states: The sage is fundamentally without words; pressed by necessity, he speaks. His words are timely and fitting, responding to others and nothing more—like the emptiness of the bellows, sounded by qi.

When words accord with principle, they do not exhaust. The words of disputatious ones collide with right and wrong; though many, they quickly reach exhaustion. Only when good and evil are both forgotten and right and wrong are not established can one be empty and without entanglement. Without entanglement, there is no partiality; without partiality, one attains the center. Abiding in the center and guarding it, one’s mind becomes vast and forgetful, returning to the celestial unity. The heart-mind of heaven and earth may thus be perceived.

**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit**

"The valley spirit does not die."
*Imperial Commentary* states: Where there is form, there is flourishing and decay; where there is number, there is completion and dissolution. Form and number together determine life and death—this is the principle of things.

The valley responds to all movements yet remains ever empty; the spirit works wonders upon the ten thousand things yet remains ever still. Within this true constancy, it is one with the Dao, neither clinging to form nor falling into number. It generates life without end, like the sun and moon, which never cease through all ages, like the Northern Dipper, which never errs through all ages—thus it is said, "does not die."

*Minister’s Exegesis* states: Confined by yin and yang, flourishing and decay take form. Enslaved by transformation, completion and dissolution follow number. Once form and number are involved, how can life be secure?

The valley, ever empty, responds to the stirrings of the multitude. The spirit, ever still, works wonders above the ten thousand things. Ever empty, it is not burdened by form; ever still, it is not bound by number. The emptiness of the valley and the wonder of the spirit merge in unity, sharing the same body as the Dao. Generating life without end, its responses are ceaseless; its transformations, unfathomable—like the sun and moon, the Northern Dipper, all enduring through all ages without ever ceasing or erring. Thus it is said, "does not die."

The reason it does not die is that it has no origin from which to die. The spirit is supreme, yet it is called the "valley spirit" because qi merges with emptiness, and the spirit lies hidden within qi. The spirit’s response is like an echo—able to contain, able to respond, able to be empty, able to be full, without end. Thus it is spoken of in terms of the valley.

"This is called the Mysterious Female."

The *Imperial Commentary* states: All things receive their mandate from Non-being and take form in Being. The valley’s function is without appearance; the spirit’s essence is without direction—this is how all things receive their mandate. "Mysterious" is the color of Heaven; "Female" is the kind of Earth—this is how all things take form. The "Valley Spirit" is likened to the constancy of the Supreme Dao; the "Mysterious Female" reveals the marvel of creation.

Minister Yi says: The Valley Spirit receives the mandate of the myriad things through Non-being; Heaven and Earth bestow form upon the myriad things through Being. Yet it is not called "Heaven and Earth" but "Mysterious Female" because it is spoken of in terms of their color and kind. Color and kind originate in qi, and thus the Mysterious Female is the means by which qi generates things. As the Mother, it nurtures the myriad things, and the principle of ceaseless generation is the marvel of creation. The gateway of the Mysterious Female is called the Root of Heaven and Earth.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: *Zhuangzi* says, "All things have that from which they are born, yet none see its root; all things have that from which they emerge, yet none see its gate." Only the sage perceives it. Thus it is here made clear: the gateway of the Mysterious Female is called the Root of Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth are the above and below of the myriad things. Things and Heaven and Earth have no before or after in origin, but when the sequence of the Great Dao is made manifest, there are first Heaven and Earth, and then the myriad things. Yet that from which Heaven and Earth themselves emerge is none other than the Mysterious Female. Who has ever seen that which precedes Heaven and Earth?

Minister Yi says: The Mysterious Female is the root of all generation, its substance belonging to yin and yang, the Mother of the myriad things. The "gate" implies opening and closing; the "root" implies the principle of generation and emergence. The qi of the Mysterious Female opens to become yang, and that which clings to yang is what it generates; it closes to become yin, and that which clings to yin is what it brings forth. Heaven and Earth are spoken of as the great forms of yin and yang. The myriad things emerge from this gate, yet none can see it—thus it is called the gateway of the Mysterious Female. "Unceasing, as if ever-present; its use is never forced."

The *Imperial Commentary* states: It is self-originating, self-rooted, enduring from antiquity—its end is unknown. This is what is meant by "unceasing, as if ever-present." Vastly, it is the creation of Heaven, entrusting itself to the self-movement of the single qi; suddenly, it is the transformation of Earth, committing the myriad forms to self-propagation. Qian is easy to know; Kun is simple in its power. It is not by forceful governance—how could there be any exertion?

Minister Yi says: The myriad things rely on qi for life and on spirit for numinosity. Thus qi is the mother of spirit, and spirit is the child of qi. When qi is firm, spirit is whole; when qi is turbid, spirit is disordered; when qi is lost, spirit departs. "Unceasing" means drawing out without end, continuing without cessation—existing before Heaven and Earth, enduring beyond Heaven and Earth. Dim and indistinct, yet it seems to be present—thus it is called "as if ever-present." Vastly, it is the creation of Heaven, entrusting itself to the self-movement of qi, yet none know how it is so. Suddenly, it is the transformation of Earth, committing the forms to self-propagation, yet none know whence they come. Its function is non-action, and it is not something that wisdom or effort can achieve—thus it is said, "its use is never forced."

---

**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth Endure**

Heaven and Earth endure. The reason Heaven and Earth can be long and enduring is that they do not live for themselves—thus they can live long.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Heaven arches above, its position on high, its warp the sun and moon, its weft the stars, and the myriad things are covered by it. Earth spreads below, its position beneath, congealing into mountains and ridges, melting into rivers and marshes, and the myriad things are borne upon it. The myriad things are covered and borne by Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth have no intent toward them. Thus Heaven moves ceaselessly in its firmness, and Earth abides immovably in its stability—this is how they can be long and enduring. If Heaven and Earth had intent toward the generation of things, then Heaven could be measured in an instant, and its covering of things would be shallow; Earth could be fathomed in an instant, and its bearing of things would be thin. If this were so, they would depend on something else to live—how then could they live long?

Minister Yi says: Returning to Non-being, who commands its form? Merging with the beginningless, who possesses its life? At the inception of bestowed life, it is one with the Great Void. Congealing into my form is like water becoming ice. The people of the world, once they receive their formed bodies, take form as their own possession; recognizing their having life, they take life as their inherent nature. Thus when form is diminished, it is not whole; when life is severed, it is not embraced. Suddenly, it passes away—what difference is there from a fleeting glimpse? They do not know that the reason Heaven and Earth can be long and enduring is that they do not live for themselves. Heaven arches above, yet it has never had intent to cover things; Earth spreads below, yet it has never had intent to bear things. Their forms are those of Heaven and Earth, yet they do not know why they are so. Their function is to cover and bear, yet they do not know why they do so. Their long endurance is not because they live for themselves. Not living for themselves, life has never truly lived. Though dwelling in having life, they are not burdened by the cares of life—thus they can live long.

Therefore, the sage places himself behind, yet finds himself ahead; treats himself as external, yet finds himself preserved.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Heaven moves above; Earth abides below. The sage stands between Heaven and Earth. When comprehended as the Three Powers, they have a mutually communicating function. When distinguished as the Three Ultimates, they have their individually established natures. When intermingled as the Three Spirits, they possess the numinous that leaves nothing unmarvelous. Thus Heaven and Earth and the sage all attain the Dao, and the sage’s way of ordering himself is none other than that of Heaven and Earth. Therefore, this chapter first speaks of Heaven and Earth not living for themselves, and then follows with the sage not possessing his own self. All people seek to be first; he alone takes the rear, saying he bears the world’s disgrace—this is called placing himself behind. Placing himself behind, he does not contend with things, and none in the world can contend with him—thus it is said, "places himself behind, yet finds himself ahead."

The sage on the path does not contend over the advantages of peril or ease; in winter and summer, he does not contend over the harmony of yin and yang. He puts death and life beyond concern, leaves misfortune and fortune behind, and his spirit is never once distressed—this is called putting his self beyond, yet his self endures.

If the sage’s way of ordering himself is thus, how much more so the things beyond his self? Meeting them without resistance, passing them without attachment, he embraces his nature and holds fast to the spirit, roaming among the customs of the world. His form will right itself, self and other become one. Born before Heaven and Earth, yet not thereby long-lived; enduring since high antiquity, yet not thereby old—are these not the effects of such unity?

Minister Yi says: If one establishes himself to precede things, then things become his adversaries, and he is overcome by them, yet his self has never truly come first. If one preserves the self through attachment to the self, then the self is lost to things, and he is overthrown by them, yet his self has never truly endured. This is the inherent principle.

The sage stands between Heaven and Earth and completes them. He can penetrate them as the Three Ultimates, distinguish them as the Three Natures, and intermingle them as the Three Spirits, merging without gap and embodying the Dao in all—his attainment is no different. Thus this chapter first speaks of Heaven and Earth not living for themselves, so they endure long and last. It then speaks of the sage putting his self behind and beyond, so he comes first and endures.

The sage has no mind to be first for himself, so he places himself behind, and none in the world can match his precedence. He has no mind to preserve himself, so he puts his self beyond, and none in the world can match his endurance. His self’s precedence, his self’s endurance—both transcend the burdens of self and other, for he has never truly possessed a self. Is it not because he is without self-interest that he achieves his self-interest?

The *Yu Zhu* says: The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is life; the great treasure of the sage is position. The Dao makes these public. Heaven and Earth embody the Dao, so they are without self-interest; without self-interest, they endure long. The sage embodies the Dao, so he is without self-interest; without self-interest, he endures always. Self-seeking is self-interest, yet none who are self-seeking can achieve their self-interest.

Minister Yi says: That Heaven, Earth, and the sage are without self-interest is because they are without self. Self-interest arises from attachment to the self, yet none who are self-interested can achieve their self-interest. Heaven and Earth have no self-serving life, so they live long; the sage has no self-serving attachment to his body, so he endures always—thus it is said he achieves his self-interest.

**Chapter Eight: The Highest Virtue Resembles Water**

The highest virtue resembles water.

The *Yu Zhu* says: The *Book of Changes* states, "The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao; that which continues it is called virtue." *Zhuangzi* says: When virtue departs from the Dao to become goodness, once the name of goodness is established, the substance of the Dao is diminished. Yet the Heavenly One generates water, which has not departed far from the Dao. Profound and empty, still and luminous—this is called the most refined essence under Heaven, thus it is said the highest virtue resembles water.

Minister Yi says: Still and unmoving, returning to the wondrous constant—this is the Dao. Responding to things and emerging in succession to the Dao—this is virtue. Returning to the utmost Dao, virtue has no place to stand; this is called the highest virtue. Once the Dao is departed from, the name of virtue is established, and the substance of the Dao is diminished. As for water, it is born of the Heavenly One, an emanation of the Dao. Water nearly is the Dao—it has not departed far. Emerging from emptiness and nothingness, flowing into fullness and being—this is how it is when issuing from the Dao. Profound and empty, its depth can unite with the Dao; still and luminous, its unity can return to the Dao—thus it has not departed far from the Dao. Issuing from the Dao yet not far from the Dao, therefore it is said the highest virtue resembles water.

Water benefits the myriad things and does not contend, dwelling where the multitude of people abhor—thus it is near to the Dao.

The *Yu Zhu* says: Melting into rain and dew, it nourishes the ten thousand forms. Congealing into frost and snow, it completes the ten thousand treasures. Channeling into rivers and streams, pooling into marshes and islets; springs deep and seas vast, drawing from and storing within, enriching all. Generating and nurturing the myriad things, all come to rely upon it without exhaustion. In benefiting the myriad things, what could be more virtuous than this? Benefiting the myriad things, the myriad things receive its grace and its bestowal, yet it always dwells in the place of softness and non-contention, accepting filth and receiving impurity without self-regard, unburdened in its heart—thus it is near to the Dao. *Ji* means near.

Minister Yi says: The governance and function of the Five Phases are great, yet water is their root. The generation and nurturing of the myriad things are vast, yet water provides their life. Extending its benefits to things, those who receive it do not know whence it comes. Things receive its grace and benefit from it, yet do not know how it reaches them. Dwelling in a place of non-contention, yet benefiting the myriad things, they do not know how it is virtuous. The filth of flowing streams, the impurities of the multitude of things—these are what those with minds abhor. Water accepts filth and receives impurity, dwelling where the multitude of people abhor, yet does not know how it is virtuous. Abhorring yet not knowing its virtue, abhorring yet not knowing its abhorrence—thus it is near to the Dao.

Dwells in good earth,
The *Yu Zhu* says: Flowing within the earth, it moves without overflowing.
Minister Yi says: Water flows within the earth—this is its nature. Its flow tends downward without overflowing, thus it is called good. If earth were like water’s goodness, earth would have found its proper dwelling.

Heart good as an abyss,
The *Yu Zhu* says: The more one measures it, the deeper it becomes; the more one exhausts it, the farther it extends.
Minister Yi says: Empty and still, deep beyond measure; obscure and bright, distant beyond exhaustion—thus the heart is good as water’s abyss.

Accords with good benevolence,
The *Yu Zhu* says: Loving all impartially, bestowing without discrimination.
Minister Yi says: Loving all impartially—this is the breadth of love. Bestowing without discrimination—this is the vastness of giving. Broad and vast, benevolence is perfected. Thus it accords with water’s good benevolence.

Words good in trust,
The *Yu Zhu* says: Avoiding obstacles to reach all seas, traversing peril without losing its trust...

Minister Yi says: Avoiding obstacles and traversing peril, branching into myriad turns, flowing through the earth’s midst, and converging into the sea—thus words are good in trust as water.

Accords with good governance,
The *Yu Zhu* says: It cleanses the filthy, levels the treacherous, following the principle of things without imposing its will—thus nothing remains untended.
Minister Yi says: Cleansing filth to clarity, leveling peril to evenness, yielding to the self-so of principle—this is water’s governance. Thus governance accords with water’s good governance.

Accords with good ability,
The *Yu Zhu* says: Adapting to the land’s contours as curves or straightness, conforming to vessels as square or round, flowing without constancy yet ever level—can anything be so capable?
Minister Yi says: Curved or straight, round or square, adapting to change without uniformity, responding as fitting, ever attaining balance—this is water’s ability. Thus affairs accord with water’s good ability.

Moves with good timing,
The *Yu Zhu* says: When yang dissolves it, it flows; when yin congeals it, it freezes. Flowing eastward when positioned in the east, westward when in the west, moving without constraint, simply following the time.
Minister Yi says: Flowing when the time is open, halting when obstructed, dissolving with yang, congealing with yin, moving with the time, yet moving without constraint—thus movement accords with water’s good timing.

Only by not contending does one avoid blame.
The *Yu Zhu* says: The sage embodies the Dao to govern the self, ensuring long-lasting existence. Embracing all with virtue brings benefit; dwelling where none contend, one occupies the ground of non-contention. *Zhuangzi* says: Is it easy to possess? To possess is to defy heaven’s propriety. To act without striving and seldom err is easy; to act and remain free from harm is difficult. Having acted for benefit, to avoid blame is thus difficult. The highest good benefits things as water does by nature: though it benefits all, it does not choose what to benefit; though it does not contend with things, nothing can contend with it—thus it is free from blame. Therefore, nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet in attacking the hard and strong, none can surpass it.

Minister Yi says: Water embraces all virtues yet does not claim them as its own, thus it acts without striving and nearly attains the Dao. People may possess all virtues yet not claim them as their own, thus they do not contend and avoid blame.

**Chapter Nine**
Hold it and fill it, yet it is better to cease.
Hone it to a point, yet it cannot be long preserved.
The *Yu Zhu* says: Fullness leads to overflow, sharpness to blunting. The principle of all things is that fullness must incur loss. Not knowing to hold back and yield precedence, to grasp emptiness to govern fullness—if one indulges in the desires of overflowing fullness, this only increases the calamity of collapse. Thus, it is better to cease. The transformations of things are endless, yet human wisdom is finite. Foreknowledge is the flower of the Dao, the beginning of folly. Gauging the nature of things and sharpening one’s pursuit of advancement—can wisdom, limited as it is, long preserve this?

Minister Yi says: Those skilled in holding fullness do not overflow; overflow brings the peril of collapse. Those skilled in gauging things do not sharpen; sharpness brings the setback of failure. Unable to forget possession, one busies oneself with prideful restraint—though momentary fullness may not yet topple, in the end there is the danger of overflow. Unable to forget emotion, one excels in calculation—though sharp advancement may repeatedly hit the mark, in the end there is the burden of exhaustion. Holding fullness and honing sharpness establish the self. With a self, things become adversaries. As things arise endlessly, to rely on the self to overcome them is perilous.

Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them.
Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting one’s own misfortune.
The *Yu Zhu* says: Gold, jade, wealth, and honor are not the principles of life and destiny; they are external things, unreliable and transient. Those who treasure gold and jade are burdened by things. Burdened by things, can they avoid loss? Thus, none can guard them. Wealth and honor breed arrogance, harming virtue. Harming virtue, can one escape misfortune? Thus, one invites one’s own misfortune. The sage does not confine the world’s benefits for private gain, nor does he regard ruling all under heaven as a personal display of eminence. How could he treasure gold and jade or be burdened by wealth and honor? Thus, the wealthiest state accumulates wealth without end, the most honored state accumulates rank without peer—yet the Dao remains unchanging.

Minister Yi says: External things are all transient, borrowed and recognized as one’s own, yet equally subject to decay. Gold, jade, wealth, and honor belong to the external; life, destiny, virtue, and the Dao reside within. To forget what is within and chase what is without is to lose one’s natural truth and drift into the illusory—this is the folly of the deluded. Gold and jade are treasures of the world, yet not inherently one’s own. Relying on them as possessions only burdens one with things. Burdened by things, can one avoid loss? Wealth and honor are what people desire, yet not inherently one’s own. Possessing them with arrogance only harms one’s virtue. Harming virtue, can one escape misfortune? The sage, free from the burden of self, though ruling all under heaven, does not regard it as a personal display of eminence. Free from the burden of things, though seizing the world’s benefits, he does not claim them for private gain—this is because he embodies the Dao, and thus his Dao remains unchanging.

When merit is achieved and fame attained, withdraw the self—this is the Way of Heaven.
The *Yu Zhu* says: Achievement leads to decline, fame to loss. The sun reaches its zenith and then wanes; the moon waxes and then wanes—this is the principle of things. The sage perceives the cycle of formation and decay, recognizing the inevitability of fullness and emptiness. Transcending all, self-possessed, unburdened by things, free from the peril of arrogance and fullness—who but one who knows Heaven could attain this? Thus, when merit is achieved and fame attained, withdraw the self—this is the Way of Heaven. The revolutions of the four seasons, where achievement leads to departure—this is the Way of Heaven. Knowing advance but not retreat, knowing existence but not demise, knowing gain but not loss—can one avoid regret?

Yi Yin said: "Your servant dares not dwell in success through favor or profit."
Your servant comments: Yin and yang alternate in their movements; cold and heat succeed one another. Where there is advance, there must be retreat; where there is fulfillment, there must be decline. Heaven bestows achievement upon things, yet its function lies in withdrawal and concealment—this is the natural Way. Those who regard merit and fame as their own affairs, advancing without knowing retreat, may possess the skill of maintaining fullness and the craft of wielding sharpness, yet can they avoid regret? The sage perceives the principle of formation and decay, recognizes the numerical patterns of fullness and emptiness, understands the subtle shifts of creation, and discerns the interdependence of fortune and misfortune—thus free from the burden of merit and fame. Knowing advance and retreat, existence and demise, they do not lose their alignment, attaining the Way of Heaven.

**Chapter Ten: Bearing the Corporeal Soul**

"Bearing the corporeal soul"—
The *Imperial Commentary* states: The *po* (corporeal soul) is yin, clinging to the body and having a fixed abode; thus, Master Lao speaks of it as being *nurtured* (*ying*). The *hun* (ethereal soul) is yang, entrusted to qi and going everywhere without restriction; thus, the *Book of Changes* speaks of it as *wandering*. The sage governs form with spirit, restrains the *po* with the *hun*, so that spirit constantly *bears* the *hun* and is not borne by the *po*—like a chariot conveying all things, like the seasons carrying cold and heat in their course. The heart roams freely in the heavens, the six senses interpenetrate, transcending heaven and earth, leaving behind the myriad things, so that spirit is never constrained—how could it be fettered by the *po*?

Your servant comments: The *hun* is entrusted to qi, and spirit pervades all without exception—this pertains to yang. The *po* clings to the body, and its nurturing has a fixed abode—this pertains to yin. When spirit bears the *hun*, life is spiritual; when it follows the *po*, death ensues. The sage’s qi is complete and firm, their spirit whole; their entry and exit, their transformations, are unburdened by any attachment to form. With yang prevailing over yin, the *hun* restraining the *po*, spirit constantly bears the *hun* and is not borne by the *po*. As for transcending heaven and earth, leaving behind the myriad things, moving alone and returning alone, responding to transformations without end—yet spirit never suffers constraint—this is because it is not borne by the *po*. The term *nurturing* (*ying*) implies a sense of lodging, settling, and gathering—referring to the *po*’s abode. The term *bearing* (*zai*) implies a sense of conveyance and movement—referring to spirit’s wandering. Thus, *bearing* is used for the *hun*, and *nurturing* for the *po*.

"Embracing the One, can you not depart from it?"
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Heaven’s One generates water, which in things becomes essence. Earth’s Two generates fire, which in things becomes spirit. Spirit and essence are born of the Dao; form fundamentally arises from essence. Guarding it without loss, uniting with spirit as one, essence and spirit merge without separation. With essence gathering spirit, with spirit employing form, with form preserving spirit—essence remains whole and unharmed, spirit is used yet inexhaustible, form lives without decay. Like the sun and moon adhering to the heavens, like grasses and trees adhering to the earth, they never depart.

I have ventured to elaborate: When a person is born, essence gathers spirit, and the bodily form is thereby complete. Flowing in all four directions, reaching everywhere without limit, above it joins with heaven, below it coils upon the earth, transforming and nurturing the myriad things—yet it cannot be represented by any image, and is called "equal to the Emperor." Yet the foolish of the world enslave themselves to things, lose their nature to custom, not for a single moment inwardly preserving spirit, while their boundless desires run outward, scattering their essence. The *hun* returns to follow the *po*, form becomes a burden to spirit, and they descend to be transformed along with the myriad things—is this not delusion? The sage is not thus. Bearing the *po* to achieve communion, embracing the One to guard it, embodying spirit in stillness—form will naturally align. Their spirit traverses Mount Tai without changing, dwells in deep springs without being drenched—who knows its beginning, who knows its end? Thus, the sage values essence.

Your servant comments: The Dao generates the One; the One is the generative number of water, the root of essence—thus, Heaven’s One, water, becomes essence. The One generates the Two; the Two is the generative number of fire, the source of spirit—thus, Earth’s Two, fire, becomes spirit. The primordial qi of the One, blending with the Great Void, is originally formless; essence arises from it. When essence is firmly rooted in the One, spirit gathers and becomes complete. When essence gathers spirit, spirit’s function is inexhaustible; when spirit governs form, form lives without decay. Thus, essence is the root of life, and the One is the number of essence. When essence is firm and unshaken, it returns to the One; when the One is embraced without departure, essence is whole. When essence is whole, spirit is whole; when spirit is whole, it harmonizes with the transformations of things and ascends to wander with the Creator. In stillness, it embodies the Dao; in action, it accords with principle—who can fathom its beginning or end? Those drowned in excessive desires, entangled in external engagements, scatter their essence and lose their numinosity; spirit is worn down by form, the *hun* is borne by the *po*, sinking into darkness. Yin prevails, and they become the lowest of fools, their heavenly principle extinguished. Only those who embrace the One without departure, though traversing myriad changes, keep their spirit whole in the One.

"Concentrating qi to attain suppleness, can you be like an infant?"
The *Imperial Commentary* states: The *Book of Changes* says: "In its stillness, Qian is *concentrated*." Yang Xiong said: "Harmony and suppleness suffice to pacify things." Stillness without admixture is called *concentration*; harmony without violence is called *suppleness*. The infant dwells without knowing what it does, moves without knowing where it goes, harboring no judgments of right or wrong, beauty or ugliness—thus its qi is concentrated and attains suppleness. Mencius said: "The stumbler and the hastener—this is qi—but it reversely agitates the heart. If the heart is insufficient to concentrate qi, then qi may stumble or hasten improperly, and the heart may become indignant or arrogant, beyond control." The sage empties the self to wander through the world, the heart does not forcibly direct qi—thus, in stillness without admixture, in harmony without violence, how do they differ from an infant? Hence, it is said: "Can you be like an infant?" Mencius said: "This qi is most great and most strong; nurtured with uprightness and without harm, it fills all between heaven and earth." Why then does Master Lao speak of *concentrating qi* as *attaining suppleness*?

The utmost hardness is employed to enact righteousness; the attainment of suppleness is used to restore nature—such was the art of the Dao in antiquity, present in all things without exception.

Minister Yi says: Qi is that which the Dao moves; things are that which qi transforms. Qi resides within heaven and earth, issuing forth and returning, while the myriad things live and die through qi. Thus, qi is the origin of the myriad things, and humans are especially noble in their ability to nurture it well.

Mencius said: "The stumbler and the hastener—this is qi—but it reversely agitates the heart." Yang Xiong said: "Qi is the steed that carries one toward good or evil." Therefore, the nurturing of qi depends fundamentally on concentration. In stillness without change, in unity without admixture, qi attains its concentration—how then could there remain the burden of stumbling or hastening, of the heart being moved, or of good and evil losing their proper course? When qi is concentrated, it is still and unified, constant and harmonious, without violence. By attaining suppleness to preserve one’s true nature, the body unites with the Dao, becoming equal to an infant.

When the fire of the heart blazes within and the steed of qi stumbles without, the heart of violence and force prevails while the virtue of pure harmony wanes. Joy and anger contend like yin and yang; desires and cravings cling to sounds and sights—this is how people fall into the calamity of reckless action and cannot return. Having cleansed and beheld the mysterious, can one be without flaw?

The *Imperial Commentary* says: The sage uses this to wash the heart, thereby cleansing all actions without possession. Retiring to concealment in the profound, one silently comprehends the wondrous principle. Such a one embodies purity and simplicity without encumbrance, neither regretting transgressions nor self-satisfied in correctness—what flaw could there be?

Minister Yi says: When the heart returns to nothingness, emotions vanish and defilements are exhausted; the heart fuses and the form is released—thus it is said, "cleansing the myriad things without possession." In profound union with the Dao, one leaves behind people and departs from things, clearly perceiving the solitary and silently comprehending the wondrous principle—thus it is said, "beholding the mysterious and silently comprehending." Having cleansed and beheld the mysterious, self and other become profoundly one—what flaw could remain?

In loving the people and governing the state, can one practice non-action?

The *Imperial Commentary* says: To love the people with benevolence and govern the state with wisdom, to enact teachings and establish laws, to bring goodness to the world—this is difficult to achieve through non-action. The sage’s beneficence extends to all generations without being for the sake of loving others; his achievements cover the world yet seem not to originate from himself—thus he practices non-action, employing the world with abundance.

Minister Yi says: To love the people with benevolence is still not free from the heart of intention; to govern the state with wisdom is still not free from the use of knowledge. Such is the labor of being bound to the heart and intellect, of toiling in action. Not acting for the sake of love, love pervades the people; not acting for the sake of governance, governance is complete in the state.

Can you open and close the gates of heaven while remaining the female?

The *Imperial Commentary* says: Knowing the male, yet guarding the female, one becomes the valley of the world. The sage embodies the transformations of heaven’s Dao, rolling and unfolding, opening and closing, never contrary to the times. Whether soft or hard, subtle or manifest, he employs them as needed. Yet he never precedes others but always follows them; he never overcomes things but always yields to them. Thus, the world delights in exalting him without weariness—this is how he remains the female.

Minister Yi says: The opening and closing of heaven’s gates are the movement of yang. Yang moves naturally, hence it is called "heaven." The Dao has its issuing forth and returning, hence it is called "gates." The sage has no intention to act, yet in opening and closing, in transformation, he responds without contrivance—is this not being the female?

With clarity extending in all four directions, can one be without knowledge?

The *Imperial Commentary* says: To guard wisdom with foolishness shares the same meaning as this. Minister Yi says: The tassels and floss of the ceremonial cap are designed to restrain brilliance; guarding it with foolishness means having no use for knowledge. With clarity extending in all four directions, one does not employ knowledge—this is how true wisdom is achieved.

To give life and to nurture, to give life without possession, to act without reliance, to grow without domination—this is called profound virtue.

The *Imperial Commentary* says: The sage preserves the spirit and knows transformation, uniting with the Dao in body—thus he matches the divine luminaries and nurtures the myriad things without exception. He gives life to fulfill their nature and nurtures them to perfect their sustenance. Without the heart of love or profit, he gives life without possession. Without the conduct of self-praise, he acts without reliance. Without the skill of carving or controlling, he grows without domination. Such virtue is deep and far-reaching, returning to things in reversal—thus it is called profound virtue.

Heaven’s Dao ascends in the north, distinguishing itself from things. Yet the profound is the color of heaven, and when the sage descends from heaven’s Dao to become virtue, nothing but the profound suffices to name it.

Minister Yi says: When the sage embraces the One and concentrates qi, reaching the point of profound vision, that which is within him is perfected. From practicing non-action and remaining the female to attaining non-knowledge, his responses to things are perfected. Within himself yet forgetting himself, within things yet forgetting things, uniting with the Dao in body—thus he sees life arising from that which gives life, nurturing that which nurtures itself. The Dao gives life to the myriad things—who claims possession or acts? Being fundamentally without action, who boasts or relies on their dominion over the world? Without the skill of carving or controlling, all is entrusted to nature. Thus it is said, "without domination." In this way, the hundred clans do not know, and the myriad things do not express gratitude—this is called profound virtue.

**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes**

Thirty spokes share one hub; it is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the cart lies. Clay is molded to form a vessel; it is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the vessel lies. Doors and windows are cut to make a room; it is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the room lies.

The *Imperial Commentary* says: Being and non-being are one in essence; utility arises from their interaction—this is called utmost spirit. Being and non-being have different appearances: being is the substance, non-being is the function. This is the movement of yin and yang, the principle of the myriad things. The use of the cart lies in transport, the use of the vessel in containment, the use of the room in emptiness. Wondrous function emerges from utmost non-being; transformation is concealed without encumbrance. Like a mirror without image, it reflects by following things. The utmost person employs the heart, ever understanding this.

Minister Yi says: Being and non-being merge into oneness—this is the full embodiment of the Dao, the utmost spirit. From non-being one reaches being, and through being one perceives non-being; thus, being and non-being take on distinct appearances. Non-being serves as the substance of being, while being serves as the function of non-being—such is the principle of all things. The turning of the cart, the storage of the vessel, the dwelling in the room—all rely on the function of non-being. The cart, the vessel, the room—all take being as their substance. Those who cling to form and regard it as their own possession will fall into mutual decay—such are the benighted. Knowing that non-being serves as the function of being is to grasp the mechanism of transformation. Comprehending the efficacy of wondrous function is to respond without limit, attaining spiritual understanding. Thus, being exists for benefit, while non-being exists for function.

The *Imperial Commentary* says: Being is solid, non-being is empty. Solidity possesses form, image, sound, and color, giving it substance; emptiness enables it to measure, respond, and adapt without exhaustion. Between heaven and earth, the Dao is revealed through vessels—thus, non-being does not discard being, while vessels derive their marvel from the Dao, so being must return to non-being. Wood bends and water moistens, fire burns and metal hardens, earth levels and spreads, giving rise to crops—this is being, on which people rely for benefit. What governs the movement of heaven, the position of earth, the progression of the four seasons, and the flourishing of the myriad things? This is non-being. The world does not perceive its advance, so its function is inexhaustible. The mutual generation of being and non-being—Laozi expounded upon these three to clarify them.

Minister Yi says: That which takes form is being, the benefit of things; that which is empty is non-being, the function of things. Being and non-being support each other to achieve success. The cart, the vessel, and the room are the most visible examples of things, so he uses these three to illustrate the utility of being and non-being.

**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**
The five colors blind the eyes; the five tones deafen the ears.

The *Imperial Commentary* says: The eyes contain the faculty of sight, which is inherent in nature. When it penetrates to clarity, it becomes wisdom, sufficient to resolve the doubts of the world. The ears contain the faculty of hearing, which is inherent in nature. When it penetrates to acuity, it becomes counsel, sufficient to comprehend the aspirations of the world. Those who perceive the Dao, above form, see solely with the spirit; beyond sound, they listen solely with qi. Since their seeing and hearing do not depend on the use of eyes and ears, how could mere sounds and colors obstruct them? The people of the world enslave their ears and eyes to the burdens of external things. Thus, their eyes are seduced by the five colors, their ears by the five tones, and their acuity and clarity decline—how can they distinguish blindness from deafness?

Minister Yi says: Those who perceive the formless attain it through spiritual vision. Those who harmonize with the soundless attain it through qi-listening. Vision does not rely on the eyes, so it penetrates to clarity. Hearing does not rely on the ears, so it penetrates to acuity. Acuity and clarity suffice for counsel and wisdom, while the ears and eyes extend to the realm of no-hearing and no-seeing—how could they be burdened by sounds and colors? When nature is swayed by emotion, one loses oneself to things. Expending spirit on sounds and colors, enslaving ears and eyes to seeing and hearing—thus, the abode of the spirit is depleted, and acuity and clarity decline. Hence, it is said: the eyes are blinded, the ears are deafened.

The five flavors dull the palate; galloping and hunting madden the heart.

The *Imperial Commentary* says: The Dao, when spoken, is bland, without flavor. The five flavors are what all people crave, yet rich flavors are truly poisonous—thus, they dull the palate. Human life: the body does not fill a fathom, yet the heart rivals creation. The heart of the sage moves to weave the ten thousand directions, and in stillness mirrors heaven and earth. The people of the world engage in hunting and thereby lose their innate goodness, unable to master themselves—is this not a great sorrow?

Minister Yi says: The great broth and pure wine are bland, without flavor—this is how one embodies the Dao. The Dao, when spoken, is bland, without flavor—this is how one speaks of the Dao. Preserving harmony and wholeness, one retains one’s celestial authenticity—there lies the supreme flavor. Pursuing the world’s cravings and indulging in the five flavors, one loses the true taste—hence, it is said: the palate is dulled. The heart roams in the origin of things, rivaling creation. When it moves outward, it suffices to weave the ten thousand directions; when it retreats in stillness, it suffices to mirror heaven and earth—this is because the heart returns to no-heart. Engaging in hunting, the spirit gallops outward without returning to harmony, the qi and blood labor, and the heart becomes mad—losing one’s nature to this extent is truly lamentable.

Rare goods hinder conduct.

The *Imperial Commentary* says: Profit nourishes people, while goods transform them—thus, mutual exchange brings mutual sufficiency. The sage does not value rare goods or strange objects, deeming common things precious, desiring that people remain content in their lot without encroachment. Valuing rare goods leads to severing the bonds of nature and life, coveting wealth and honor—what conduct can be preserved? Thus, it hinders conduct. Zhonghui’s praise of Tang said: “He did not amass goods or profit.” Confucius said to Zigong: “Ci, you do not accept fate and instead amass wealth.” Such is the way goods hinder conduct.

Minister Yi says: Those who understand where righteousness and fate lie recognize the limits of wealth and honor. Knowing one’s limits and abiding by them, how could one suffer the ills of plunder, competition, or envy? Rare goods are what the world values, not because they are truly useful, but because they are mistakenly deemed fine due to their rarity. Valuing their rarity leads to severing the bonds of nature and life in pursuit of obtaining them—thus, conduct is ruined. Who would consider this? Hence, it is said: they hinder conduct.

Therefore, the sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes—thus, he discards that and selects this.

The *Imperial Commentary* says: In the *Book of Changes*, Kun represents the belly, for it bears and contains with thickness.

The *Li* trigram represents the eyes, for they see outward and bring clarity. To bear with thickness and contain all is to accept without exception. To see outward and bring clarity is to fall short in some things. The sage takes the world as his measure, thus choosing this capacious belly rather than governing every affair and scrutinizing every thing. Hence, he discards those outward-seeing eyes.

The *Zhuangzi* says: "No thief is greater than virtue; when the mind has intentions, the mind has eyes—thus the sage discards them."

Minister Yi says: That which makes no distinctions and accepts all is the belly. That which sees and distinguishes is the eye. Thus, Kun, with its thickness, bears and contains as the belly, while Li, with its outward vision, brings clarity as the eyes. To contain is to accept without exception, aligning with the body of the Dao. To see clearly is to perceive what one cannot reach, establishing the self as an instrument—hence, the sage discards that and selects this.

Sounds, tastes, and desires for profit all lose one’s nature. Moved by external things, the emotions become enslaved. The eyes are the most numerous in this, so they are mentioned first. If the eyes are not blind, the ears not deaf, the mouth not erring, the mind not mad, and conduct not hindered, then the emotions are forgotten, the qi is whole, and the belly is full—thus, in the end, it is said: he acts for the belly, not for the eyes.

**Chapter Thirteen: Favor and Disgrace**

Favor and disgrace are like alarm; value great calamity as one’s own body.

*Imperial Commentary* states: Favor comes from below, honor from above. Dwelling in favor as glory is disgrace. Occupying honor as profit invites no greater calamity. Those who esteem wealth cannot refuse emolument; those who prize renown cannot renounce fame. Clinging to power, one cannot share authority—grasping it brings trembling, relinquishing it brings sorrow. Is this not why favor and disgrace strike like alarm? Grief and anguish, ease and joy, assail the body in turn; fear of constraint, elation and dread, overwhelm the heart. Is this not why great calamity is valued as one’s own body?

*Minister’s Exegesis* states: Receiving favor from others and taking it as glory—what greater disgrace is there? Occupying honor in one’s time and making it one’s own profit—what greater calamity exists? Favor and disgrace arise from gain and loss; the coming of gain and loss startles the heart. Startled by gain and loss, one is moved by glory and disgrace—hence, it is said they are *like alarm*. Taking another’s honor as one’s own profit, firmly occupying it, one burdens the heart, becoming entangled in the calamities of deliberate action, unable to free oneself.

What is meant by *favor and disgrace*? Favor is inferior.
*Imperial Commentary* states: The dragon, as a creature, transforms at will, uncontrollable and untamable. If it can be domesticated, its will is bent toward domestication—this is the way of disgrace. The ancients who excelled as scholars regarded the three ranks of honor as insufficient to alter their integrity, and the emolument of ten thousand *zhong* as insufficient to sway their resolve. Abiding in favor yet mindful of peril, dwelling in fortune yet empty as a valley—what disgrace could there be? Coveting high position, desiring royal emolument, knowing advancement but not retreat, knowing gain but not loss—thus others hold one in contempt. Therefore, receiving favor from others is the way of inferiority.
*Minister’s Exegesis* states: Taking another’s favor as glory makes the recipient act in disgrace—this is the way of inferiority. Moreover, knowing advancement but not retreat, knowing gain but not loss—this is how one treads into sorrow and invites bodily harm, becoming contemptible to others. Is this not inferior? Gaining it as if alarmed, losing it as if alarmed—this is called *favor and disgrace are like alarm*.

*Imperial Commentary* states: Rank and insignia upon the body are not the principle of life and destiny. Things that come by chance are but lodgings—what comes as a lodging cannot be refused, so the perfected person does not rejoice in gain. What departs cannot be resisted, so the perfected person does not grieve over loss. Now, if one is displeased by its departure and delighted by its arrival, gain and loss burden the heart—how can one not be alarmed? Liuxia Hui served as chief judge and was thrice dismissed yet did not leave; Zheng Kaofu was thrice ennobled and crept along the wall—these differ from such a state.
*Minister’s Exegesis* states: Favor and disgrace arise from gain and loss; when gain and loss arrive, the heart is burdened, the spirit is startled—this is being alarmed by gain and loss, thus producing favor and disgrace. Without gain, there is no loss; without favor, there is no disgrace. Forgetting gain and loss, what is there to alarm? Without alarm, where are favor and disgrace?

What is meant by *value great calamity as one’s own body*?
*Imperial Commentary* states: Grasping profit and power, monopolizing rewards and punishments, wielding fortune and might, the world fears one as if divine, reveres one as if Heaven—this may be called honor. Yet the sage does not burden himself with honor, thus abiding long in wealth and honor without calamity. It is like a person whose limbs are maimed, senses dulled, form abandoned, wisdom forsaken—merged with the Great Thoroughfare, there is nowhere one does not find contentment. The people of the world exchange their nature for things, thus burdened by things and unable to forget power; the form burdens the heart, thus the heart is lost and unable to forget the form—this calamity is great indeed.
*Minister’s Exegesis* states: Those who burden themselves with honor forget their own worth and cling to another’s honor—who can escape calamity? Only the sage, free of self, treads the highest honor yet never burdens himself with it—this is how one long preserves honor without the calamities of the human realm. Engaging with the self brings the calamity of having a body; the heart is enslaved by honor, the body is encumbered by glory—this calamity is great.

*What is the reason I have great calamity? Because I have a body. If I had no body, what calamity would I have?*
*Imperial Commentary* states: In human life, the hundred bones, nine orifices, five viscera, and six bowels are all complete within—with whom do I share kinship? Recognizing and claiming them is delusion. Those who embody the Dao understand this, so Confucius said: *"If I hear the Dao in the morning, I could die in the evening."* Mencius said: *"Neither premature death nor long life sways me."* Yanzi said: *"Hui has sat in forgetfulness."* Life and death are indeed great, yet they bring no change to oneself—how much less the trifles of gain and loss, fortune and misfortune? Thus the ancients’ perfected persons did not burden their forms with profit, nor their hearts with form. Viewing the myriad things as equal to oneself, one finds nothing to choose—thus my body is not my own. Above, one roams with the Creator; below, one befriends those who regard death and life as one, beginning and end as equal—what calamity could I have? Moreover, favor is what the world honors, yet one deems it disgrace; honor is what people delight in, yet one deems it calamity. Truly, external things cannot be relied upon—the principle is inherently so. If one can possess them as if possessing nothing, then though favored, one is not disgraced; though honored, one is without calamity. Yi Yin did not dwell in success through favor or profit; Yao did not take position as joy—these nearly attained it.
*Minister’s Exegesis* states: Having a self, one has a body; having a body, one has calamity. Without a body, the self is fundamentally nonexistent—if I do not even possess myself, what care could there be? The form is not burdened by things, thus the form returns to formlessness; the heart is not burdened by form, thus the heart returns to mindlessness—this is how, above, one roams with the Creator, and I have no body.

Beneath, one befriends those who equalize life and death in their beginning and end—what care could there be? Seeing favor as disgrace, treading nobility while knowing calamity, then favor and nobility lie with others—what could one rely upon? Thus, one who values their person as the world may be entrusted with the world. One who cherishes their person as the world may be confided with the world.

*Imperial Commentary* states: The world is a great vessel—none but the Dao may set it in motion. The world is a divine vessel—none but the Dao may preserve it. The sage embodies the Dao, thus they govern the world through non-interference, and the world delights in their leadership without weariness. Those next in rank know to value their person and do not debase themselves to be enslaved by things—these may be entrusted. Those who know to cherish their person and do not debase themselves to be harried by things—these may be confided. Thus it is said: The essence of the Dao is for governing the self; its remnants are for governing the state; its dregs are for governing the world. Yet worldly lords risk their persons and abandon their lives to pursue things—is this not lamentable?

*Minister’s Exegesis* states: The sage embodies the Dao, and in the world, their stillness is guarded by the Dao, their movement is set in motion by the Dao—how could they burden themselves with the world’s affairs and instead find it a weight? The world delights in their leadership without weariness—what calamity could there be? If one has not yet attained this, yet knows to value their person through the Dao and does not lose themselves in base degradation, then they know self-respect—thus they may receive the world’s trust. If one knows to cherish their person through the Dao and does not follow things into self-abandonment, then they know self-love—thus they may receive the world’s confidence. The world’s trust and confidence are rooted in the Dao. Though one may not fully embody the Dao, knowing to value and cherish the self through the Dao, it is said: they *may* be entrusted and confided.

**Chapter Fourteen**
*"Look at it, yet it cannot be seen—this is called the Even."*

*Imperial Commentary* states: The eye governs sight, and sight discerns things. The Even is level and undifferentiated—beyond what sight can reach, thus it is called the Even. The Great Simplicity before form is qi.

*Minister’s Exegesis* states: To see is to employ clarity; to perceive is to have an object. With my clarity, I perceive that object—this is merely the reach of the eye’s power. When the myriad dharmas unite as one and self and other merge in mystery, beyond what sight can reach, what is there left to see?

*"Listen to it, yet it cannot be heard—this is called the Rare."*

*Imperial Commentary* states: The ear governs hearing, and hearing investigates things. The Rare is vast yet intermittent—beyond what hearing can grasp, thus it is called the Rare. The great sound is rare indeed.

*Minister’s Exegesis* states: Sound arises from things, responding to their stimuli. As they belong to existence, they may be heard. Yet within soundlessness, harmony alone is heard—thus it is said: the great sound is rare. When only the rare sound is heard, it is vast yet intermittent—thus it is called the Rare.

*"Grasp it, yet it cannot be held—this is called the Subtle."*

*Imperial Commentary* states: Subtle, oh so subtle—reaching formlessness, who could grasp it? The great image is without form.

*Minister’s Exegesis* states: What may be grasped and held clings to form and vessel. Without anything to grasp, one seeks to hold yet cannot—this is the great image. Within such formlessness, something alone is perceived—thus it is called the Subtle.

These three cannot be sought, thus they merge into one.

*Imperial Commentary* states: Before the Great Simplicity divides, who distinguishes high and low? The great sound is rare—who discerns purity and turbidity? The great image is without form—who measures great and small? The eye has no use for its clarity, the ear no application for its acuity, the body no exhaustion of its strength—the full embodiment of the Dao resides herein. It cannot be fathomed, nor can it be probed. Qi, form, and substance are complete yet not yet separated—thus they merge into one. Yet having become one, can it remain without speech?

*Minister’s Exegesis* states: To look, listen, and grasp is not nothingness; to not see, not hear, not hold is not existence. Called the Even, called the Rare, called the Subtle—it is as if existing, as if not. As if existing, as if not, it cannot be interrogated as one—thus it merges without gap. Alike in having from non-being, alike in non-being from having—this is the merging into one. Above, it is not bright; below, it is not dark.

*Imperial Commentary* states: That which is above form is unfathomable as yin and yang, profound and difficult to know—this is called the utmost spirit, thus it is not bright. *Bright* means luminous. That which is below form is one yin, one yang, distinct and numbered—this is called the utmost Dao, thus it is not dark. *Dark* means obscure. The *Book of Changes* says: "To spiritually enlighten it depends on the person."

*Minister’s Exegesis* states: Engaging with form and vessel, there is the distinction of yin and yang—thus above is bright and below is dark, a principle that is inherently so. Where the utmost spirit works its wonders, above one does not know its brightness. Where the utmost Dao operates, below one does not know its darkness. Neither bright nor dark, it does not depart from the one.

Endless, oh, it cannot be named—it returns to no-thing.

*Imperial Commentary* states: The body of the Dao is like the constancy of day and night, yet its depths of darkness and light cannot be fathomed—how could it be described in terms of appearance, sound, or color? Thus it returns to no-thing.

*Minister’s Exegesis* states: The one is the warp of the Dao. Uniting being and non-being, above and below, into a profound unity—this is the Dao’s unnameability. A cord is made by joining strands; *endless* speaks of its ceaselessness. One and again one—this is the meaning of the ever more mysterious. Returning to the state before things began, thus it is said: it returns to no-thing.

This is called the form of the formless, the image of no-thing—this is called the indistinct and vague.

*Imperial Commentary* states: The form of the formless, the image of no-thing—vague, oh, within it there is something; indistinct, oh, within it there is an image. Like the great void containing the myriad images, yet its beginnings and ends cannot be perceived.

As if a numinous intelligence acts of itself, yet none can fathom its workings—call it "having" yet not having, call it "not having" yet not not having. Like the sun and moon far removed from man: seek them with mirror and burning-glass, and water and fire come of themselves. Where, then, do water and fire truly reside? The form of the formless, the image of no-thing—it is just like this.

*Minister’s Exegesis* states: The form of the formless is present yet unseen; the image of no-thing is present yet unattainable. Having returned to no-thing, it is as if things never began. The form of the formless, the image of no-thing—these again circle back to no-thing. To call it "having" yet not having, to call it "not having" yet not not having—this is what is meant by "indistinct and vague." Meet it and you do not see its front; follow it and you do not see its rear.

*Imperial Commentary* states: It has no beginning, no end; thus, whether you meet it or follow it, there is nothing to be seen.

*Minister’s Exegesis* states: When bound to the mechanism of emergence and withdrawal, of beginning and end, there is distinction between front and rear. But the Dao returns to formlessness—who then can speak of front and rear? The Dao abides in no-thing—how can one grasp it as having front or rear? Its coming cannot be met, its going cannot be followed. Who knows its beginning? Who knows its end? Hold to the Dao of old to steer the being of today. To know the ancient beginning—this is called the discipline of the Dao.

*Imperial Commentary* states: The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao. Those who follow heaven but reject earth may be blinded by the Dao’s movement and rely on their strong yang. Those who follow yin but reject yang may drown in the Dao’s stillness and halt at withered desiccation. Those who act for themselves abandon propriety; those who act for others abandon righteousness—how can this be the Dao of old? The Dao of old cannot be pressed for answers, yet it is not having; it is called "vague power" yet not not having. Holding to it to govern the world, one adapts and exhausts its benefits, rouses and exhausts its spirit, and there is nothing it cannot accomplish. The great constancy of the Dao is unchanging in this—is this not what is meant by "existing since ancient times"? Thus it is said: To know the ancient beginning—this is called the discipline of the Dao.

*Minister’s Exegesis* states: The Dao of old is simply the One. Holding to the One in application, one can steer all that is under heaven. "Today" refers to the time when affairs arise; "ancient" refers to the time before departing from the One. To know the ancient beginning is to grasp the great constancy of the Dao—thus it is called the discipline of the Dao.

**Chapter Fifteen: The Skill of the Ancient Scholar**

The scholars of old who were skilled in their art were subtle, wondrous, profound, and penetrating—so deep as to be unfathomable.

*Imperial Commentary* states: The scholars of old differed from those of today; those skilled in their art differed from the unskilled. Thus, subtlety unites them with the Dao, wonder makes them one with the spirit, profundity matches them to heaven, and penetration foreshadows sageliness. Their depth of application is such that it cannot be plumbed. The *Book of Documents* says: "The mind of the Dao is subtle"—thus subtlety is the Dao. The *Book of Changes* says: "The spirit is that which wondrously brings forth the myriad things"—thus wonder is the spirit. The *Book of Changes* says: "Heaven is profound, and earth is yellow"—thus profundity is the color of heaven. The *Commentary* says: "That which penetrates all affairs is called sageliness"—thus penetration is the work of the sage. The depth of water can be measured; the depth of a cave can be explored. But the scholars of old who were skilled in their art were subtle, wondrous, profound, and penetrating—names and realities did not enter them, yet their mechanism arose from their heels. Their depth was such that it could not be plumbed. Liezi dwelled in the gardens of Zheng for forty years, and no one recognized him. Laozi said to Confucius: "A good merchant stores his goods as if his treasury were empty; a gentleman of great virtue appears dull-witted"—was he not speaking of this?

*Minister’s Exegesis* states: "Ancient" refers to the beginning of things, when the Dao had not yet departed from the One. Those who succeeded the Dao were good—thus goodness is the emanation of the Dao. Today, however, is the time when affairs press upon us, and scholars take up their tasks accordingly. This is why the scholars of old differed from those of today. Only by emerging from the ancient beginning, succeeding the Dao with goodness, can one return to the Dao. Taking the Dao upon oneself, one can bear the Dao. Thus they could be subtle, wondrous, profound, and penetrating—so deep as to be unfathomable. Their subtlety uniting them with the Dao speaks of the Dao’s depth; their wonder making them one with the spirit speaks of the spirit’s depth. Matching heaven’s profundity and acting in accordance with nature speaks of the depth of principle. Foreshadowing sageliness in penetration and attaining the profound in action speaks of the depth of affairs. Those with shallow mechanisms can be measured in an instant; but for those whose depth is great, who can know them? Precisely because they cannot be known, we force descriptions upon them.

*Imperial Commentary* states: The height of heaven cannot be measured in an instant; the depth of earth cannot be plumbed in an instant. That it is said to be round in covering and square in bearing is merely an approximation of its appearance. Forcing descriptions upon it—how can one truly grasp its utmost?

*Minister’s Exegesis* states: So deep as to be unknowable, it admits no sound—who can compare or discuss it? Forcing descriptions upon it, one can only borrow analogies, as in "like a river reaching a marsh."

Cautious, as if crossing a river in winter; hesitant, as if fearing one’s four neighbors.

*Imperial Commentary* states: "Cautious" means anticipating trouble before it arises; "hesitant" means harboring doubt about one’s own affairs. Those of old who embodied the Dao made inner cultivation their task, not delighting in engaging with things. Fearful and vigilant, they responded only when unavoidable—like crossing a river in winter, holding fast without losing themselves. Like fearing one’s four neighbors, as the *Book of Changes* says: "With this, one fasts and abstains."

*Minister’s Exegesis* states: When things probe them, they respond only under pressure—not delighting in engaging with things. Anticipating trouble before affairs arise is called "cautious"; fearing after affairs arise is called "hesitant." Crossing in winter speaks of acting only when unavoidable, advancing with hesitation—not what one desires.

Fearing one’s four neighbors speaks of how what is to be feared presses closely upon me, never parting—so one remains vigilant and dares not indulge. Solemn in demeanor.

*Minister’s Exegesis* states: "Solemn" describes a bearing of dignified gravity; "demeanor" refers to its ever-shifting aspect. By its gravity, the *Record* likens it to one deep in thought; by its variability, *Zhuangzi* calls it "composed bearing"—solemn as a guest’s form, forgetting yet appearing serene.

Dispersing like ice about to melt,
*Minister’s Exegesis* states: Clinging to form obstructs being; roaming the origin of things returns one to nonbeing. To leave things behind and depart from the self—this is what it means to disperse. Like ice about to melt, this is how one attains mysterious sameness. Water congeals into ice, then melts back into water, never departing from its essence, perfectly fused and interpenetrating.

Thick as if uncarved wood,
*Minister’s Exegesis* states: Returning to the profound thickness of one’s nature and destiny—this is called "thick." Like wood in its wholeness, undivided into implements—this is called "uncarved."

Vast as if a valley,
*Minister’s Exegesis* states: When the heart returns to non-heart, it becomes as boundless as the Great Void—vast to the utmost, like an empty valley, capable of receiving and responding.

Turbid as if muddy.
*Minister’s Exegesis* states: Self and other merge indistinguishably, as one without separation—like a muddy stream, concealing filth and embracing impurity.

Who can still the turbid and gradually clarify it?
Who can rouse the tranquil and gradually bring it to life?
*Minister’s Exegesis* states: Stillness is not the act of moving toward stillness, yet movement is never without stillness. Movement is not the act of departing from stillness, yet stillness is never without movement. One who attains both movement and stillness finds the Dao in action. Thus, the ancients who served the Dao moved turbidly yet never departed from stillness, so they gradually clarified themselves, and nothing could muddy them. Their stillness was tranquil yet never ceased moving, so they gradually came to life, and nothing could make them stagnant. To harbor the intent of cessation is to be bound by things—how then could one respond without harm?

Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.
*Minister’s Exegesis* states: Those who serve the Dao forget the heart in the Dao. If one clings to possession and prides oneself on it, though something remains, it is already meager—thus they do not desire fullness. Fullness means taking pride in what one has and becoming self-satisfied. Satisfaction leads to overturning—this is the inevitable principle of reason. How can one preserve it?

Only by not being full can one remain worn yet not newly made.
*Minister’s Exegesis* states: Fullness must lead to overturning, for self-satisfaction inevitably brings about renewal and completion. This is the principle of decay and ruin, the cycle of succession—who can preserve fullness? The new gives way to the old, completion gives way to loss, alternating and interdependent like the turning of a wheel.

Those capable of renewal and completion are those who turn toward affairs and act. Those capable of decay return to the Dao and act not. When things are newly completed, they are fit for use and turn toward affairs. When things reach decay, they are cast aside by time and return to the Dao. To decay without renewing or completing—what fullness can there be? This is how the Dao is preserved.

**Chapter Sixteen: Reaching the Utmost of Emptiness**

Reach the utmost of emptiness; guard the depth of stillness.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Nothing is more precious than emptiness; nothing is more excellent than stillness. Emptiness and stillness are the root of the myriad things. Emptiness suffices to receive all actualities; stillness suffices to respond to all movements. *Utmost* is where the many converge and reach their limit. *Depth* is where effort is exerted and reaches its limit. To reach the utmost of emptiness and press toward its limit, to guard stillness and attain its depth—then, though the ten thousand forms be tangled, my heart remains ever clear; though the ten thousand changes be manifold, my heart remains ever tranquil. This is called the joy of Heaven. Those who do not embody the Dao cannot partake of it.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Emptiness is the convergence of the Dao. Stillness is the return of the Dao. Emptiness is not burdened by things, and so it becomes the dwelling of all actualities. Stillness does not mingle with things, and so it becomes the source of all movements. Only through emptiness and stillness can one serve as the mirror of Heaven and Earth, the illumination of the myriad things—so that the ten thousand forms and ten thousand changes cannot disturb it. *Utmost* is the central point of the Dao, where the many converge. *Depth* is the movement and action of the Dao, where effort reaches its limit. To govern emptiness and reach its utmost limit, to guard stillness and attain its deepest depth—if one does not reach this, actualities may obstruct the Dao; if one does not attain this, movement may violate one’s nature.

The myriad things arise together; I thereby observe their return.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: The changes of the myriad things lie at the end of the Dao. Those who embody the Dao dwell above the myriad things. Things have their origins in sprouting and their ends in returning. As they arise together and hasten toward the path of movement and emergence, I observe that the moving must become still, and the emergent must return. Thereby, I perceive the heart of Heaven and Earth—engaging with things without being transformed along with them. This is called observing their return.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The myriad things are endowed with form between Heaven and Earth. Yin and yang marshal the qi to enter and exit, laboring under the mechanism of Heaven and toiling under the transformations of spirit. They hasten toward the path of living existence, arising together without cease. Only by observing stillness in movement and observing return in emergence can those who embody the Dao do so. Thus, to observe return amid the arising of the myriad things is to perceive the heart of Heaven and Earth—how much more so the myriad things!

The things, luxuriant and manifold, each return to their root.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: *Luxuriant and manifold* is the image of movement and emergence. The myriad things emerge from *Zhen*, meet in *Li*, then luxuriate and arise together, their blossoms and splendor issuing outward. Delighting in *Dui* and laboring in *Kan*, they shed their blossoms and turn toward substance, returning to the abode of their nature. *Destiny* is the root of nature, and nature is its root. *Essence* is the mother of spirit, and spirit is its child. When essence is whole, spirit flourishes; when nature is fully realized, one reaches destiny.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: *Luxuriant and manifold* is how things come to be. *Root* is where things return. Blossoms and splendor issue from the root and grow; returning to the abode of nature, they revert to their root. When the root is great, the branches flourish—thus the root is the destiny of things. The luxuriant and manifold return to the root, thereby returning to destiny. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called returning to destiny.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Flowing and moving, they generate things. When things are generated, their principles take form—this is called *shape*. The shape embodies spirit, each having its own pattern—this is called *nature*. That which is not yet formed has its allotment, existing thus without gap—this is called *destiny*. Destiny spans past and present, ever abiding; nature shifts through ten thousand forms yet remains unchanged. Does the person who preserves their form and life depart from wisdom? Thus, returning to quiescent stability, one knows that destiny lies within oneself—just as spring and summer inevitably give way to autumn and winter. Embracing nature and holding fast to spirit, one examines oneself within—this is called returning to destiny.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: *Luxuriant and manifold* is the blossom of movement, the division of form. *Returning to the root* is the utmost of stillness, the return of destiny. The myriad things receive destiny from the formless and take shape in the formed. Thus, there is destiny, then life; there is life, then nature; there is nature, then feeling. When feeling responds to movement, it flows into things. Flowing into things, it pursues the branches and harms the root, chases things and loses its nature—thus destiny is extinguished. Only when form is forgotten and one does not know whence it arises, when the heart is forgotten and one does not know whence it stirs—observing return amid the arising of things—is principle fully exhausted. When the luxuriant and manifold each return to their root, their nature is fully realized. When principle is exhausted and nature is fully realized, one returns to stillness and oneness, reverts to the utmost of nothingness—thus it is called returning to destiny.

Returning to destiny is called constancy.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: *Constancy* is the term opposed to change. Returning to destiny, the ten thousand changes cannot alter it. Without gap or cessation, it unites with the Dao, accords with Heaven and Earth, and merges with the Qi-Mother.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: *Constancy* is not seen as close, and so it has no beginning or end. It does not cling to form nor fall into calculation. It unites with the Dao and is not altered by change—this is the true constancy of the Dao. Without returning to destiny, one cannot attain it.

Knowing constancy is called clarity.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Knowing the constancy of the Dao, one is not altered by things. Thus, the six penetrations follow one another, sufficing to mirror Heaven and Earth, sufficing to illuminate the myriad things.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: To know without relying on the heart, yet attain the constancy of the Dao—this is true knowledge. To see without relying on the eyes, yet perceive the formless—this is the self-awareness of nature. Thus, it is called clarity.

True knowledge is not altered by things, and clarity thus suffuses and illumines Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. Not knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The sage knows the constancy of the Dao, and so his actions accord with principle, ever meeting with good fortune. Those who do not know constancy follow things in their flux, stumbling into calamity at every turn. Thus, they falsely perceive beauty and ugliness, opposing the Dao; they recklessly generate right and wrong, diverging from the Dao. Moreover, they cannot secure their destiny, hence misfortune.

The *Book of Changes* says: *Return* is not reckless. To be deluded and not know return—this is recklessness indeed.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Knowing the return of destiny, one knows constancy. Not knowing the return of destiny, one gallops outward, entangling with things, forgetting the root of one’s nature, destiny, virtue, and power, drowning in the branches of beauty and ugliness, right and wrong. Grasping at that which is real, one drifts into falsity, losing essence and forfeiting spirit, never knowing to return. Deluded and not knowing return, who can escape misfortune?

Knowing constancy, one is all-embracing.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Knowing constancy, one does not harbor right or wrong, beauty or ugliness, and thus nothing is not embraced.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Knowing constancy, one returns to utmost emptiness, becoming one body with the Dao—this is the perfection of embrace.

Embrace leads to impartiality.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Without a mind that embraces, one does not exclusively cherish one’s kin nor exclusively love one’s children—what partiality could there be?

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Embracing nothing, one darkly accords with the Dao. Self and other are not established—how could there be partiality?

Impartiality leads to kingship.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: When the great Dao prevails, the world is impartial. Thus, the world delights in exalting one without weariness.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Being impartial with the Dao, one becomes the destination of the world, hence the delight in exalting one without weariness.

Kingship leads to Heaven, Heaven leads to the Dao.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: One who unites Heaven, Earth, and humanity and stands at the center of Heaven and Earth is a king. That which is one and great, above and covering all without exception, is Heaven. That by which Heaven, Earth, and humanity are all guided is the Dao. Perfecting humanity, one becomes one with Heaven; embodying Heaven, one becomes one with the Dao.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The world’s destination, yet not knowing its destination, is entrusted to spontaneity. Great and covering all without exception, one becomes one with Heaven. Forgetting the reason for being so, yet being so, one returns to nothingness—this is perfecting humanity and embodying Heaven to become one with the Dao.

The Dao endures; to the end of one’s days, one is not imperiled.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: The Dao is everlasting, without flaw through the ages. All things that attain it flourish. It is the gateway of a hundred sages, inexhaustible; it veils Heaven and Earth, unceasing. Thus, to the end of one’s days, one is not imperiled. Imperilment borders on misfortune; subtlety borders on good fortune. Without imperilment, there is no reckless action’s misfortune—none but those who know constancy partake in this.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Only the Dao endures; endurance is the constancy of the Dao. The Dao abides in nothingness, hence it endures. The self is bound to form, hence it perishes. Yet though it perishes, it is not imperiled—though dead, it has never truly died. How much less could there be the misfortune of reckless action?

**Chapter Seventeen: The Highest**

Of the highest, those below merely know of its existence.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Governing the world with freedom, one harmonizes with the age and finds joy in it. Without the joy of delight, yet praise and intimacy do not reach one. Without the suffering of distress, yet fear and insult do not come. Nothing is done, yet all is spontaneous. Thus, those below merely know of its existence.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: In an age of perfect governance, the ruler practices non-action. Knowing only its outward signs, the world uniformly lives yet does not know why it lives, uniformly attains yet does not know why it attains. They merely know of their superior, yet never perceive the superior’s influence upon them.

Next, they cherish and praise it.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Bestowing blessings upon the people, laws are transmitted through the ages. The world loves one as parents, hence they cherish it. A noble name arises like the sun and moon, hence they praise it. This is the governance of emperors and kings. The traces of cherishing and praise are manifest, and the great harmony of the Dao is diminished.

*Zhuangzi* says: Shun had a flaw, yet the people delighted in him. They sang at the Spirit Tower, speaking of how the people first attached themselves to King Wen.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The governance of the seven virtues is enacted through action. There is kindness to be cherished, allowing attachment; there is virtue to be embraced, allowing praise. Though the traces of governance surpass a single era, the wholeness of the Dao and virtue has already dispersed into the realm of the artificial.

Next, they fear and insult it.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Guiding with policies, ordering with punishments, hence they fear it. Rewarding the entire world does not encourage the good; punishing the entire world does not deter the wicked. When feudal lords inquire about the weight of the tripods, as the viscount of Chu did, or when vassals steal treasures and great bows, as Yang Hu did—these are the customs of a declining age, hence they insult it.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Governance not grasping the essentials attends to outward traces. Even when practicing benevolence and righteousness, the transformation of benevolence and righteousness cannot be fully realized. Thus, they fear its penal majesty and govern with legal institutions. Laws emerge, and deceit arises; decrees descend, and fraud is born. Feudal lords go so far as to inquire about the tripods; vassals go so far as to steal treasures. Hence, it is said they fear and insult it.

Thus, when trust is insufficient, there is distrust.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Attachment is not with glue or lacquer; restraint is not with cords or ropes—this is utmost trust. The Shang people made oaths, and the people began to rebel. The Zhou people held assemblies, and the people began to doubt. Trust was insufficient, hence this.

Of the highest, those below merely know of its existence—then it is fitting, and they do not perceive it as trust. When they fear and insult it, they know the cunning of deceit, the subtlety of trickery, the ingenuity of opportunism, and thus there is distrust.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Governance not rooted in the Dao, with the superior not trusting the Dao, resorts to legal institutions to establish authority, expecting people to fear and not insult. Yet trust is insufficient.

When the superior’s trust is insufficient, those below respond with distrust, and day by day grow ever more deceitful and shallow—of great disorders, what could govern them? Thus, how solemnly they esteem speech!

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Viewing speech through the Dao, if the ruler of all under Heaven is upright, how could words be treated lightly? They are guarded and revered, never dared to be taken lightly. Thus, when words are spoken, they become the Way for all under Heaven to follow; when words arise from the self, all under Heaven is transformed.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: To esteem speech is not to treat it lightly. If speech itself is not treated lightly, how could actions be? When actions are not taken lightly, there is trust in the Dao. Because distrust leads to disorder, they esteem speech so solemnly.

When merits are accomplished and affairs are settled, the common people all say, “We did it naturally.”

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The achievements of emperors and kings are but the surplus affairs of sages. When the people find their food sweet, their clothing beautiful, their customs peaceful, and their occupations joyful, these surplus affairs suffice to complete the work of emperors and kings. Yet they say, “We did it naturally,” as if to ask, “What has imperial power to do with us?” This is called the governance of the highest.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: To engage in affairs and exhaust one’s spirit in shallow pursuits—though called governance, it daily descends into disorder, for it is not rooted in the Dao. To return to nature and life, allowing growth and completion to unfold naturally—though called non-action, what does imperial power have to do with it? To esteem speech is to govern without words and transform through the Dao. Thus, the achievements of emperors and kings, the affairs of the age, once accomplished and settled, leave the people unable to describe them. They all say, “We did it naturally,” unaware of the superior’s governance, knowing only that the superior exists.

**Chapter Eighteen: The Abandonment of the Great Dao**

When the great Dao is abandoned, there are benevolence and righteousness.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Lose the Dao, and virtue follows; lose virtue, and benevolence follows; lose benevolence, and righteousness follows. Benevolence establishes others; righteousness establishes the self—yet how far they have strayed from the Dao! Han Yu, failing to grasp the sages’ intent regarding the Dao and virtue, claimed that *ren* and *yi* were fixed terms while the Dao and virtue were empty positions. His criticism of Laozi for belittling benevolence and righteousness reveals his own limited vision—what *Zhuangzi* called “the benighted people.”

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The great Dao is nameless, where self and other dissolve, returning to perfect nothingness, leaving no room for sound. With benevolence and righteousness, one has already strayed far from the Dao. Virtue is divided: benevolence loves others but cannot yet forget them; righteousness establishes the self but cannot yet forget the self. When benevolence and righteousness stand to the right, the burdens of self and other remain. Turning toward affairs and actions, the Dao is abandoned.

When wisdom and intelligence emerge, there is great falsity.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: When the people’s wisdom and strength are exhausted, falsity follows.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: With the wisdom of knowledge and the intelligence of the heart, one seeks to control the changes of the world, acting and intervening—then the people, competing with cleverness, give rise to falsity and chaos.

When the six relations are not in harmony, there are filial piety and compassion. When the state is benighted and disordered, there are loyal ministers.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Names arise from insufficiency.

*Master Zhuang* says: The filial son does not flatter his parents; the loyal minister does not fawn upon his lord—this is the height of ministerial and filial devotion.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: When the six relations are in harmony, one does not recognize what makes them filial or compassionate. When the state is well-governed, one does not recognize the loyalty of its ministers. Only in harmony and order do filial piety and loyalty become commonplace. Without filial compassion, the name of filial compassion arises. Only when there is disloyalty does one praise loyalty.

**Chapter Nineteen: "Abandoning Sagacity and Discarding Knowledge"**

Abandon sagacity and discard knowledge, and the people will benefit a hundredfold.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The Dao endows them with nature, one and unadulterated. Departing from the Dao to establish virtue is called sagacity and knowledge. Once sagacity and knowledge are established, the world begins to produce lofty, intricate, and ostentatious conduct—startling the foolish and enlightening the benighted, praising Yao and condemning Jie. Thus, the benefits of sagacity and knowledge to the world are few, while their harms are many. Abandoning them to unite with the Dao, each rests in the integrity of their nature and destiny—such benefit is vast.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The names of sagacity and knowledge depart from the Dao and divide from virtue. The people’s nature loses its true purity and strays from primordial simplicity, so sagacity and knowledge emerge. Sagacity takes transformation as its essence; knowledge takes discernment as its function. When superiors govern inferiors with sagacity and knowledge, the people contend to follow the traces of sagacity and knowledge, unaware of what they truly value. Chasing the branches and forgetting the root, they compound harm upon the people. When sagacity and knowledge have no use and retreat into abandonment, the people will naturally attain great compliance, forget what they once admired, and find sufficiency in their inherent nature—thus their benefit is vast.

Abandon benevolence and discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial compassion.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Filial compassion is innate nature. Striving for benevolence and straining for righteousness replace one’s nature with them. Abandoning benevolence and righteousness, the people will revert to their nature and return to their origin—not only loving their own kin or cherishing their own children—how could filial compassion be lacking?

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Filial compassion is the substance of benevolence and righteousness. Once the names of benevolence and righteousness are established, the people’s nature is lost. Their nature is inherently sufficient in filial compassion, yet burdened by the names of benevolence and righteousness—earnest and scrupulous, names and reality entangle, disrupting nature. Only by abandoning the traces of benevolence and righteousness will the people wholly preserve their Heaven-given nature, sincerely engaging with one another and forgetting artificial distinctions—thus restoring filial compassion.

Abandon skill and discard profit, and thieves and bandits will cease to exist.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Those who craft cunning schemes have no use for shame. Those with covetous hearts disregard righteousness—both are thieves and burglars.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: When skill is prized, one exhausts their wit and stops at nothing—what shame remains? When profit is esteemed, one values goods and insists on acquisition—what righteousness is regarded? Only when skill is abandoned will the people labor with their hands and find ease in sufficiency. Only when profit is discarded will the people practice restraint and have abundance—how then could thieves and bandits exist?

These three are deemed insufficient as cultural refinements, so they are made to belong to something greater.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The former kings governed the world by human principles; by the Zhou, culture had become excessive. When it reached its decline, culture overcame substance. Culture was in surplus while substance was lacking. The world universally lost its plain and unadorned truth, daily sinking into the habits of private desire. At the end of the Zhou, Master Lao sought to remedy this corruption and return to the root. Thus, he cast aside ritual and propriety, abolished learning and scholarship, and even sagacity and knowledge were rejected. Did he truly believe benevolence, righteousness, sagacity, and knowledge were insufficient to govern the world? The Way of the former kings is like a cycle—when culture is excessive, nothing restores substance like simplicity. Thus, they are made to belong to something greater: "manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, and diminish desire."

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Sagacity, knowledge, benevolence, righteousness, skill, and profit—these three pairs preserve culture while destroying substance. Thus, the people lose their benefit, filial compassion is not restored, and thieves and bandits multiply. This arises from trust being insufficient while cultural refinements are complete—hence the need for abandonment. Abandoning these refinements prevents the world from losing its truth and drifting into falsity. Thus, Master Lao loosened the excesses of culture to return to the root, making them belong to something greater. "Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, and diminish desire"—such is the belonging.

**"Manifest plainness"**

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The *Analects* says, "Painting comes after plainness." Plainness has not yet received color—manifesting plainness is pure and unadulterated.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Nature is originally pure and plain. When moved, it is stained by things and becomes mixed and inconsistent. When nature is tranquil, it is pure and unified, free from things—naturally manifesting thus, hence "manifest plainness."

**"Embrace simplicity"**

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The *Classic* says, "When simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels." Simplicity has never been severed—embracing simplicity is tranquil, unified, and unchanging. *Master Zhuang* says: "Being the same in having no desires is called plain simplicity." In plain simplicity, the people’s nature is attained.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Simplicity is the undivided, uncarved whole of wood. The people’s nature is complete in spontaneity, not yet turned toward things—unified and unchanging, preserved without loss—hence "embrace simplicity."

**"Reduce selfishness and diminish desire"**

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Self-promotion is selfishness, and nothing nurtures the heart better than diminishing desire. Reducing selfishness and diminishing desire settles the distinction between inner and outer, clarifies the return of truth and falsity, and completes virtue while restoring nature—thus the names of sagacity and knowledge vanish.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: When selfish desire prevails, one loses oneself in things. Reducing selfishness and diminishing desire turns inward, lightens external things, recognizes what is truly valuable, and preserves Heavenly virtue. With virtue complete and nature restored to its origin—what need is there for sagacity and knowledge?

**Abandoning Learning Brings No Sorrow**

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Learning is for exhaustively investigating principle. Yet when one is devoted to learning to exhaust principle, pondering good and bad, examining order and chaos—can one be without sorrow? Learning is for attaining the Dao. Seeing the Dao, one abandons learning, diminishing again and again until reaching non-action that leaves nothing undone. Then, following the natural course of one’s nature and destiny, there is no circumstance that does not bring joy—thus, no sorrow.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Those who are complete in Heaven have no need for externals, hence they abandon learning. Right and wrong are boundless; deluded knowledge and false views discriminate endlessly—thus, much sorrow. When learning is abandoned, there is no need for thought and deliberation. Spirit is preserved and restored, no longer enslaved to cleverness and discernment. Following the truth of one’s nature and destiny, where is there not spontaneous joy?

*"Ah!" and "alas!"—how far apart are they? Good and evil—how distant are they?*

The *Imperial Commentary* states: "Ah!" and "alas!" share the same sound; good and evil arise from one nature. Petty wisdom, self-serving, divides them into two. The enlightened, with a broad view, know their root is not different. The sage’s governance of the world—in ancestral temples and court halls, when speaking with ministers—does not distinguish them thus. Suppressing evil and promoting good, fearing failure, is because what people fear cannot but be feared.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: "Ah!" and "alas!"—good and evil—are distinctions made by deluded emotions, differing by so little—what is there to compare? "Ah!" and "alas!" are both sounds that issue forth; good and evil both arise from nature. Sound and nature are one. Taking "ah!" as reverence, "alas!" as rudeness, good as right, evil as wrong—all belong to delusion. With penetrating insight, all is fundamentally the same—what difference remains?

*What people fear cannot but be feared.*

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The Dao stirs the myriad things yet does not share the sage’s sorrows. Fortune and misfortune fluctuate with the people—this is the realm of affairs. Those who embody the Dao are without sorrow; those who engage in affairs have fears. If one does not take heed of what people fear, how can one avoid calamity? Thus, the noble person cultivates vigilance and introspection. The *Book of Songs* says: *"In awe of Heaven’s majesty."*

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Embodying non-action, the Dao unites self and others—what sorrow or fear could there be? Engaging in the governance of the world, fortune and misfortune are shared with the people. Thus, what people fear cannot but be feared—one does not set oneself apart but shares the people’s joys and sorrows. To not fear what should be feared—how can one avoid calamity?

*Vast and boundless, it has no end.*

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The ten thousand changes of worldly affairs are tangled and ungovernable, difficult to conclude, without limit—so-called good and evil are not yet fixed. Only the enlightened know that all is one.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The realm of affairs and actions, with emotions shifting endlessly, succeed and supplant one another without cease. The threads of turmoil arise without bound—vast and immense, without limit. Only those who are obscurely one forget self and others, deluded emotions instantly vanish, and they know that all is one.

*The multitude bustle and rejoice, as if feasting on a grand sacrifice, as if ascending a terrace in spring.*

The *Imperial Commentary* states: All things flourish with yang and congeal with yin. The bustling and rejoicing are the outward signs of flourishing. The multitude, having lost the stillness of their nature, are devoted to external pursuits—like delighting in rich flavors to nourish the body, like gazing upon lofty splendor to please the mind. Such indulgent ones drift ever farther from the Dao.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Worldly affairs and things change endlessly, their ten thousand threads arising without end, their origins without limit—vast and boundless. Those who study the Dao deeply reject them; only those who embody the Dao are unburdened. The sage governs the world, and what people fear cannot but be feared. Yet following this with *"vast and boundless, it has no end"* shows that even the sage regards affairs with awe. The multitude, pursuing things and losing their nature, forsaking stillness for activity, abandon their most precious inherent joy, chasing the trivial ends of affairs. They bustle and rejoice, unaware of their own burdens. Thus, in their external pursuits, they have not yet been ensnared, believing themselves to have found flavor and delighting in it—hence, *"as if feasting on a grand sacrifice."* Believing themselves to have found pleasure and amusing their hearts—hence, *"as if ascending a terrace in spring."*

*Alone I am desolate, without sign, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile.*

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The *Classic* says: *"Return to the state of the infant."* Zhuangzi says: *"Before reaching the stage of the smiling infant, who is there?"* The infant’s desires and concerns have not yet arisen; near and far are viewed as one. Desolate and still, harmony and compliance accumulate within, and brilliance does not manifest externally—thus, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Alone, forgetting the self, wandering in the origin of nature, desolate and without things—signs have not yet appeared. Thus, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile, the mind is focused on the One, desires and concerns unarisen. Nature preserves its truth, not distinguishing near and far.

*Adrift, as if having nowhere to return.*

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The *Book of Changes* says: *"Riding the six dragons to govern Heaven."* Riding the current means following the times and responding to principle without leaning toward one side—thus, as if having nowhere to return.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Riding principle to adapt to the changes of affairs and things, without attachment or bias.

*The multitude all have more than enough.*

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Someone asked, *"Who are the multitude?"* The reply: *"Those who, born into wealth and honor, are greedy and covetous. The heart of extravagance prevails, while the resolve for frugality is faint—thus, all have more than enough."* In the Dao, this is called *"excess food and redundant actions."*

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The multitude, grasping at things and falsity, obtain their flavors and joys—thus, they have more than enough.

*Alone I seem lacking.*

The *Imperial Commentary* states: One’s merit covers the world yet seems not one’s own.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The sage abandons things and distances people, standing alone.

*How foolish is my heart—so pure and simple!*

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Confucius said: *"When I speak with Yan Hui, he never disagrees all day—like a fool."*

Pure indeed! The celestial mechanism lies unspread, yet silently accords with the Dao—this is called great wisdom.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Great wisdom appears foolish, for it employs no cunning; nothing is done through knowing. Thus, it is utterly pure, with no scheming heart arising. In perfect unity, it silently accords with the Dao.

The vulgar are bright and clear; I alone seem dim.
The vulgar are sharp and discerning; I alone am dull and muddled.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Those who conform to common custom deem brightness as clarity, yet their clarity is small. They regard sharpness as wisdom, yet their wisdom is forced. Abandoning things and distancing oneself from others, one scorns the habits of the age—then, though seeming lost, one abides; though appearing dull, one is keen. How could the vulgar ever glimpse this?

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Brightness and sharpness—thus does the vulgar world employ petty wisdom for self-interest. Dimness and dullness, however, use no wisdom; self and others merge as one. Seeming lost, yet present; appearing dull, yet keen.

Vast as the sea, serene and still.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Profound stillness and settled nature—this is the full embodiment of the Dao.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The nature-sea lies deep and unfathomable, boundless and immeasurable—this is the essence of the Dao.

Boundless, as if without end.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Ever-changing yet never abiding—this is the active function of the Dao.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Where there is form, there is cessation; where there is cessation, there is attachment, and no freedom. Where there is no form, there is no cessation; where there is no cessation, there is no clinging, and nothing is beyond reach—this is the function of the Dao.

All others have their uses; I alone am stubborn and coarse.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Cinnamon is edible, so it is cut down. Lacquer is useful, so it is slashed. People know the use of what is useful, but none know the use of what is useless. All others have their uses—this is the use of the useful. I alone am stubborn and coarse—this is the use of the useless. The *Tradition* says: "The heart that does not follow the warp of virtue and rightness is called stubborn." In ancient times, the refined was called beautiful; the rustic, coarse. Stubbornness means no adornment of wisdom; coarseness means no display of beauty. The spirit-person thus remains unfit for use.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Falling into form and instrumentality renders one usable. What is usable is objectified by things. When things reach the point of adornment and beauty, they become even more useful and not discarded. Stubbornness means no adornment; coarseness means no beauty—this is why I am of no use to the world, and the world and I remain indifferent to one another.

I alone differ from others, valuing the search for nourishment from the Mother.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Like a foal or calf following its dam, one seeks only the Dao. The Dao gives birth, nurtures, rears, and fosters all things—thus it bears the meaning of the Mother. Seeking only the Dao is what sets one apart from those who lose their nature to custom.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Born of the Dao, one daily constructs oneself through things, losing one’s true nature and forgetting to return to the root. Losing what gave one life, one fails to know what sustains one—this is why one values seeking nourishment from the Mother. Seeking from the Mother is returning to the Dao and recovering one’s nature. Feeding from the Mother is being nourished by the Dao and preserving one’s authenticity.

**Chapter Twenty-One: The Manifestation of Vast Virtue**

The manifestation of vast virtue follows only the Dao.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: "One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao." What things obtain to live is called virtue. The Dao is ever without name—how could it be described? Thus, its virtue is called numinous. Virtue has direction and form, and all things obtain it equally—thus the Dao is made manifest. Cultivating nature and returning to virtue, when virtue reaches its fullness, it reverts to the beginning. Therefore, it follows only the Dao.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The Dao is subtle in its formlessness, fundamentally beyond description. Virtue follows the Dao, so the Dao is made manifest through virtue. What is called virtue is what is obtained from the Dao. When virtue reaches its fullness and reverts to the beginning, it merges once more with the Dao.

The Dao as a thing is only vague and indistinct.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: The body of the Dao is utterly formless, yet its function is wondrous. It is the source of all things, yet nothing is not the Dao. "Vague" means it has images that may be seen. "Indistinct" means it has patterns that may be discerned. Yet what is called "having" is doubtful, verging on nothingness. Thus, it is said, "the Dao as a thing."

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The Dao as a thing is what is perfectly blended—this is called the thing of no-thing. Vague, yet having images, though its images are not visible. Indistinct, yet having patterns, though its patterns cannot be discerned.

Vague and indistinct, within it are images.
Indistinct and vague, within it are things.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: What is seen is called an image; what is formed is called a thing. Within the indistinct and vague, images and things are both present. Like the great void transforming into thunder and wind, like the great clod changing into water and fire—thus it accomplishes transformation, thus it moves as spirits. This is called the wonder of the Dao.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Vague and indistinct—neither being nor non-being. From indistinct to vague, within it are images—from nothingness to being. From vague to indistinct, within it are things—from being to nothingness. Thunder, wind, water, and fire are images and things, from nothingness to being, from being to nothingness. Thus they accomplish transformation, thus they move as spirits, and return to the ultimate Dao. Therefore, it is called the wonder of the Dao.

Dark and obscure, within it is essence.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: "Dark" is the utmost of seclusion. "Obscure" is the concealment of brightness. Within the dark and obscure lies the source of utmost yin, where the Celestial One first appears, and essence truly arises.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Essence arises from the Celestial One as the root of bodily life. Thus, following the discussion of images and things, it speaks of the dark and obscure. After the vague and indistinct, with images and things, it describes the essence of the Dao’s body. The dark and obscure hold essence—this is the beginning of all things’ generation.

Its essence is utterly real, within it is sincerity.
From ancient times to the present, its name does not depart.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Essence is the utmost of celestial virtue, upright and not false—thus it is called utterly real.

One remains unchanging, thus it is called "having sincerity." Uninterrupted in its constancy, thus its name does not depart.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: One that does not depart is complete in celestial virtue—this is the utmost of truth. One that does not change responds to its mandate like an echo—this is the utmost of sincerity. From ancient times to the present, there is neither past nor present; its name does not depart—this is what is called the eternal name.

"By this I know the origin of the myriad things." How do I know the nature of the myriad things? By this.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The transformations of the myriad things pass like days, ceaseless and unending. The utmost truth of essence abides, never departing. The sage values essence, thus able to observe the changes of the myriad things and know their causes.

Without thought, it is quiescent; without action, it is unmoving. Yet moved by resonance, it penetrates the patterns of all under heaven. Thought arises as its inception, and the traces of achievement manifest—without the utmost essence of all under heaven, who could attain this?

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Things perfected in beauty are called "origins." The beauty of the myriad things shifts and changes without constancy, thus the transformations of the myriad origins flow unceasingly. The truth of their essence remains one and undivided, abiding without departure—thus one may know the impermanence of the myriad things.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: "Bending, Then Whole"**

"Bending, then whole."
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Flowing with things and moving with their waves, one preserves one’s form and life without loss. *Zhuangzi* says: "Those who bend externally follow others as companions."

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Without intent toward things, forgetting form in oneself, one can follow the changes of the myriad things, yielding and bending without resisting them. Thus, nothing harms them, and life is preserved whole.

"Yielding, then straight."
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Forsaking excess without resentment, enduring hardship without lament, thus inwardly straight without losing correctness. *The Book of Changes* says: "The inchworm’s bending is to seek extension."

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Straightness is sought through extension. Yielding to the crookedness of things without asserting one’s own straightness, thus inwardly straight without losing correctness—this is not bending oneself to seek straightness. If one clings to one’s own straightness and cannot follow change, this is not the way to seek extension.

"Hollow, then full."
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Without hoarding, thus having surplus.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Hollow is like a sunken place where water gathers, thus always full. A small hollow is always full without hoarding, thus having surplus.

"Worn, then renewed."
The *Imperial Commentary* states: If winter’s closure is not secure, spring’s growth will not flourish.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Worn in winter, renewed in spring—such is the principle of things.

"Little, then gained; much, then confused."
The *Imperial Commentary* states: The essentials of the Dao are not burdensome. Hearing and seeing much is not as good as simplicity. Taking branches for the root leads to lifelong confusion—this is called great delusion.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The Dao, virtue, nature, and destiny do not depart from attaining oneness. The affairs and things of the world arise in myriad threads. Thus, the sage embraces the One as the model for all under heaven.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Being without duality in its nature, its generation of things is unfathomable. Only the utmost essence of all under heaven can become the utmost spirit. The sage embraces the One to guard it, not disturbing its essence. Thus, speech becomes the model for all under heaven, and action becomes the law for all under heaven.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Little gains the principle of nature and destiny; much confuses the changes of affairs and things. Thus, the sage embraces the One without departing from reality, embodying the Dao and exhausting nature, merging self and other in mystery, becoming the model for all under heaven.

"Not self-displaying, thus bright."
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Not obscured by one’s own views, thus nothing is not illuminated—hence, bright.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Those who display themselves are obscured by partiality. Those who do not display themselves unite into brightness.

"Not self-asserting, thus illustrious."
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Not partial to one’s own correctness but following what is correct, thus achievements are great, names are illustrious, and all under heaven submits—hence, illustrious.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Those who assert themselves lose others. Those who do not assert themselves can employ others. Employing others, they follow what is correct, and achievements become illustrious—hence, illustrious.

"Not self-boasting, thus meritorious."
The *Imperial Commentary* states: *The Book of Documents* says: "You alone do not boast, thus none under heaven can contend with you for merit."

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Boasting leads to arrogance, and others will not acknowledge one’s merit.

"Not self-aggrandizing, thus enduring."
The *Imperial Commentary* states: *The Book of Documents* says: "You alone do not aggrandize yourself, thus none under heaven can contend with you for ability."

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Aggrandizing oneself leads to ostentation, and others will not help one achieve ability.

"Only by not contending does none under heaven contend with them."
The *Imperial Commentary* states: All people seek to be first; only the self remains behind, daily receiving the world’s disgrace. In this way, one always abides in the place of non-contention—who can contend with them?

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Having a self leads to contention; forgetting the self, nothing contends with them.

The ancient saying "bending, then whole"—was this empty words? Truly whole, one returns to it.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The sage’s movement is like water, engaging with things without losing wholeness. Their response is like a marking-line, following principle without losing straightness. Knowing hollowness leads to fullness, without the burden of arrogance. Knowing wear leads to renewal, without the traces of boasting. As if by nature’s own doing, without knowing who does it—attaining bending alone, thus whole and returning to it. One can preserve the body, exhaust one’s years, and not know their end. This is called the person of complete virtue—was this empty words?

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Emptying the self to wander in the world, attaining bending to respond to principle, following the changes of things in great compliance without resisting them—this is the wholeness of attaining the Dao. Not self-displaying, not self-asserting, not self-boasting, not self-aggrandizing, and ultimately not contending—all are means to attain bending.

Whose clarity shines forth, whose achievements endure long—so that none in the world can contend with them—may be called the perfection of sincerity, wholly returned to it. Perfected in sincerity and wholly returned to it, thus one can preserve the body, exhaust one’s years, and not know their end.

**Chapter Twenty-Three: Few Words, Naturalness**

Few words, naturalness.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: "Few" means standing alone above the myriad things without opposing them—what *Liezi* calls "doubtful solitude." Abandoning cunning and contrivance, following Heaven’s principle without attending to externals, thus words are natural.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: "Few" means being distant from things, not paired with them, thus able to stand alone above the myriad things without opposing them. "Natural" means that which arises without cause. That which has a cause is human artifice; that without cause is Heaven’s principle. Thus, abandon cunning and contrivance, follow Heaven’s principle, and do not attend to externals.

Therefore, whirlwinds do not last the morning; sudden rains do not last the day. Who brings these about? Heaven and Earth.

Heaven and Earth cannot even endure forever—how then could man?

The *Imperial Commentary* states: In Heaven and Earth’s creation of the myriad things, wind disperses them, entrusting all forms to self-transformation; rain moistens them, allowing all things to self-nourish. Thus, they neither augment life nor urge its completion, and the myriad things naturally flourish between Heaven and Earth—this is why they endure long. But whirlwinds and sudden rains bring the affliction of discord between yin and yang; if something compels them, things suffer harm, and so they cannot last. The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Wind’s transformation lies in stirring and scattering; rain’s benefit lies in moistening and nourishing. When their qi is harmonious and their timing responsive, they entrust the myriad things to self-transformation and self-benefit—thus they endure long. But whirlwinds and sudden rains prevail in force, arriving with violence, injuring the harmony of the two qi, and disordering the seasons’ commands—thus things suffer harm. If even Heaven and Earth, in bringing these about, cannot last the span of a morning or a day, how much less can man? This is why one must return to the fewness of words and naturalness.

Therefore, those who engage with the Dao: those of the Dao unite with the Dao; those of virtue unite with virtue; those of loss unite with loss. Those who unite with the Dao, the Dao also attains them. Those who unite with virtue, virtue also attains them. Those who unite with loss, loss also attains them.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The few stand beyond all engagement, beyond the realm of sound, awakening alone through their nature, becoming one with the Dao and not sharing with things—how could virtue be named, or loss be a burden? Only by not knowing the naturalness of solitary transformation, and instead deeming the Dao difficult to know and difficult to practice, as if ascending to heaven and seemingly unattainable, does one begin to toil the mind and exhaust the body in engaging with the Dao—sometimes leaning toward one side, sometimes blinded by one corner, and the arts of the Dao are torn asunder by the world. Those of the Dao unite with the Dao; those of virtue unite with virtue; those of loss unite with loss. Yet if they do not attain their own attainment, then what they attain is precisely what becomes loss. The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The Dao forgets both self and things, abiding in the great void, awakening alone and reverting to constant nothingness. The Dao is but a forced name—what is there to engage with? To have something to engage with, something to attend to, is to depart from the Dao and enter the realm of forms and vessels, becoming the artifice of man. Those who deem the Dao difficult to know and difficult to practice thus unite with it. With attainment and loss, they exhaust their minds in thought and their bodies in toil, spending their lives in engagement, enslaving their natural truth without knowing to return. Thus, in the three—Dao, virtue, and loss—each takes what it recognizes as the Dao, humbles itself to engage with it, and seeks what it unites with, each attaining its own attainment. Yet what they attain is precisely a return to loss, not merging with the few.

Where trust is insufficient, there is distrust.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Trust is without delusion; delusion sees truth and falsehood. If one takes the Dao as true and things as false, then trust is insufficient, and so there is distrust. The followers of Huishi and Han Fei all derive their terms from the Dao’s greatness as opposed to smallness, and thus it can be named. The Dao’s subtlety is small and hidden; its center is great and manifest.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The Dao’s essence is constant nothingness, and thus it has no name. Because it pervades all, it is called by the name "Dao." Because it encompasses all, it is forcibly named "great." "Great" means "passing on." The *Imperial Commentary* states: It moves without lingering, thus it is called "passing on." The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Great and without place it does not go, thus it is so. "Passing on" means "far." The *Imperial Commentary* states: It responds without exhaustion, thus it is called "far." The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Passing on without cease, it responds without exhaustion. "Far" means "return." The *Imperial Commentary* states: Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is reverting to the mandate, thus it is called "return." The Dao’s central essence, when named as great, pervades and encompasses all without distinction—this is what is meant by "in speaking of the far, it is not hindered." When the moving is still and the acting ceases, it returns and repeats its Dao, not departing from its nature—this is what the *Book of Changes* calls "in speaking of the near, it is still and correct." The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Passing on without cease, it becomes far; far, it must return; returning, it reverts to the Dao.

Thus, the Dao is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; the king is also great. The *Imperial Commentary* states: The Dao covers and bears Heaven and Earth. Heaven covers all without exception; Earth bears all without exception. The king stands between Heaven and Earth, and with them forms a triad—thus he is also great. The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Heaven and Earth’s covering and bearing are enveloped by the Dao. The king stands between them, assisting in Heaven and Earth’s proper work to nurture the myriad things. Heaven governs Earth; the Dao governs Heaven. Nothing is greater than these four. Within the realm, there are four great ones, and the king occupies one of them. The *Imperial Commentary* states: Descending from the Dao, there are directions and forms, thus it is called "within the realm." Still, he is sagely; in motion, he is kingly. Able to penetrate the three powers and connect the human Dao, he is thus king. Therefore, he shares the same essence as the Dao, shares the same work as Heaven and Earth, and is likewise called "great." The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The Dao gives rise to things yet is not a thing; in relation to things, it is called "having things." The Dao’s central essence, therefore, along with Heaven, Earth, and the king, has not yet departed from the greatness within the realm.

Man models himself on Earth; Earth models itself on Heaven; Heaven models itself on the Dao; the Dao models itself on naturalness. The *Imperial Commentary* states: "Man" refers to the king. Heaven does not produce, yet the myriad things transform; Earth does not grow, yet the myriad things are nurtured; the emperor and king do nothing, yet the world achieves its work. What they model themselves on is simply the Dao’s naturalness. The Dao models itself on naturalness because it responds to things. Naturalness is not the Dao’s entirety; it emerges to respond to things, thus descending to model itself below. The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: When there is something to align with, and it naturally becomes so, then naturalness resides above things, emerging below non-things—it is not the Dao’s entirety. Only because the Dao emerges to respond to things does it model itself below.

The four each model themselves on something, yet there is no before or after—none know their beginning.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: Weight as the Root of Lightness**
Weight is the root of lightness; stillness is the lord of restlessness.
Thus the noble person travels all day yet does not part from their heavy supplies.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Weight does not sway or lose its hold, thus it is the root of lightness. Stillness does not move recklessly but maintains control, thus it is the lord of restlessness. Holding fast to stillness and weight, one seldom loses their way. The noble person travels all day without parting from their heavy supplies, and so treads perilous paths without harm.
The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Weight can bear lightness, but lightness cannot bear weight—thus weight is its root, and lightness may be lifted. Stillness can govern restlessness, but restlessness cannot govern stillness—thus stillness is its lord, and restlessness may be settled. The noble person travels all day without parting from their heavy supplies, meaning they are never without weight—how could they act lightly? Weight is difficult to move; when difficult to move, thoughts are unified; when thoughts are unified, they are comprehensive; when comprehensive, there is no peril in affairs. Heavy supplies sustain one on the road, thus they cannot be abandoned. When one’s inner self is weighty, external things become light—thus the desires of the ears and eyes cannot disturb, power and prestige cannot sway, and life and death cannot alter. Even when treading perilous paths, what cause for concern is there?
Though there be splendid sights, one dwells in tranquility, transcendent.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Splendid sights belong to external things; tranquil dwelling belongs to the self. Only when the self is at peace can things be enjoyed.
The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Those who delight in external things are drawn outward, their hearts wandering among splendid sights. Those who cultivate inner harmony remain composed, their bodies at ease in tranquil dwelling. Thus, though splendid sights exist, they cannot compare to the transcendence of tranquil dwelling.
How could the lord of ten thousand chariots treat his person lightly before the world?
The *Imperial Commentary* states: The world is a great thing. One who possesses a great thing trembles as if driving six horses with rotten reins—thus one cannot treat their person lightly before the world.
The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The ruler bears the weight of the world in his single person—thus he cannot treat his person lightly before the world. Lightness loses ministers; restlessness loses the lord.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Without weight, there is no awe, thus one loses ministers. Without leading by example, one provokes transgression, thus one loses the lord.
The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Weight and stillness establish control, and the Way of ruler and minister is preserved.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Skillful Action**
Skillful action leaves no wheel tracks.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: What abides is spirit; what passes is transformation—thus there are no wheel tracks.
The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: To arrive without traveling is skillful action. The Dao moves through the world of its own accord, while I do nothing—thus there are no wheel tracks. In an age of perfect virtue, worthies are not esteemed, abilities are not employed; the ruler is like the tip of a branch, the people like wild deer. When spiritual transformation is unknown, what tracks could there be?
Skillful speech bears no flaw or blame.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Harmonizing with the natural boundary, following its unfolding—thus there is no flaw or blame. The greatness of words and deeds begins with deliberation and ends in transformation. Only the sage can perfect their words and deeds, achieving the subtlety of transformation. Thus their actions leave no traceable tracks, and their words bear no burdensome flaws.
The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: To be understood without speaking is skillful speech. Without speaking, there is no flaw or blame. The sage withdraws their brilliance behind tassels of floss, entrusting sight and hearing to the world. Reverent in their southern-facing seat, affairs are accomplished among the hundred clans. What does Heaven say? The four seasons proceed, the hundred things are born.
Skillful reckoning requires no counting rods.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Penetrating the One, all affairs are complete—how much more so for what lies beyond calculation? Thus, without counting rods, the myriad transformations are as clear as counting one or two.
The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Profoundly attuned to unity, following Heaven’s principle, they respond to the myriad complexities with clarity—what need is there for counting rods? This is the excellence of reckoning.
Skillful closure requires no bolts or bars yet cannot be opened.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Guarding the spirit, withdrawing into secrecy.
The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Withdrawing sight and returning hearing, resting in the brilliance of inner illumination, the spirit returns to qi, and qi unites with the Dao—this is skillful closure within oneself. Preventing wrongdoing before it arises, cutting off evil before it sprouts, so that the hearts of the unworthy have no means to arise—this is skillful closure in external things.
Skillful binding requires no cords or knots yet cannot be undone.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: To rely on cords and knots for firmness is to pare away one’s nature. If one does not speak yet nourishes others with harmony, stands alongside them yet transforms them, then bonds are firm without knots—who could undo them?
The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: When the ruler binds the world with perfect trust, and the world is satisfied in trust, so that the old find peace and the young find care—who could undo this?
Thus the sage is ever skillful in saving people, and so there are no abandoned people. Ever skillful in saving things, and so there are no abandoned things.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Skillfulness is the continuation of the Dao. When one is submerged in the Dao, there is no skillfulness to be named. Once the name of skillfulness is established, the Dao emerges to benefit the world. The sage embodies the Dao to aid the world, thus possessing these five skills and extending to people and things without abandonment. Yet the sage’s love for people and benefit to things, allowing things to fulfill their lives and people to delight in their natures, is not by design. Returning to the One without trace, they simply follow what is constant.
The world has lost the Dao. The world has entirely lost its tranquil, still, and constant nature, daily sinking into the realm of care and exhaustion—who but the sage can save it?
The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The sage embodies the Dao in non-action, spiritually transforming the world. Rooted in the five skills, they save people before illness arises and save things before harm occurs. Yet they do not display the traces of their saving, and the people do not know by what power they are aided—each simply rests in their life. This is called inheriting illumination.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: To inherit is to bring forth without display. Inheriting illumination, one’s light shines yet does not dazzle.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: I do not reveal the means by which I act, and thus people do not know how it comes to be—this is to inherit the five virtues of the superior, called inheriting illumination. Therefore, the good person is the teacher of the not-good person, and the not-good person is the resource of the good person.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: "Resource" speaks of its benefit. Only when there is the not-good does one know the goodness of the good as beneficial.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Only with goodness does one see the not-goodness of others, thus the good person becomes the teacher of the not-good person. Only with not-goodness does one see the goodness of others, thus the not-good person becomes the resource of the good person. If one does not value their teacher nor cherish their resource,

The *Imperial Commentary* states: When all under heaven know the good as good, the not-good ceases to be. Good and not-good, self and other are both forgotten. With no room for intention, what need is there for valuing or cherishing? This is how the sage achieves great unity with all things.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: When good and evil are clear, emotions and deceit arise, and all under heaven becomes ungovernable. Thus, only when valuing and cherishing are absent do good and evil both fade, self and other become one reality, and the mysterious virtue is preserved whole. Though wisdom may lead to great delusion, this is the essential subtlety.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The essential subtlety of the Dao does not obscure the many goods, nor does it employ wisdom. The seven sages all lose their way, with no path to inquire after—this principle accords with that.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Where there is knowledge, there are things, and one fails to know the subtlety of no-thing. Though called wisdom, it is great delusion regarding the Dao. The subtlety of the Dao is rooted in this, thus it is called essential.

**Exegesis by Gentleman-Official Zhang An**

**The Daoist Classic, Chapter Twenty-Eight: "Know the Male, Keep to the Female"**

"Know the male, keep to the female, and be the ravine of the world." As the ravine of the world, constant virtue does not depart, and one returns to the state of an infant.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The male overcomes things with strength, while the female is merely gentle and still. The sage’s wisdom knows how to overcome things, yet abides in softness and stillness. All things turn toward him, drawing sustenance without exhaustion—thus he is the ravine of the world. Just as a ravine lies low and all waters flow toward it, so too does he hold fast to humility rather than strength. Then virtue and nature remain united without separation, which is called wholeness of power. Hence it is said: "Constant virtue does not depart, and one returns to the state of an infant." The infant’s qi is harmonious and not violent; its nature is pure and not yet scattered. Mencius said: "The great man does not lose the heart of a newborn child."

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The male, being yang, moves and is strong; the female, being yin, is still and soft. Movement tends toward action, while stillness is rooted in holding fast. Moving without losing stillness—thus one knows the male and acts in due time. Only stillness can govern movement, so one guards the female and does not overcome with strength. The female is still and yields to others, becoming the refuge of all movement. Like a ravine, it receives streams and sustains things without showing depletion. Virtue reaches constancy, unified and unbroken—this is the ultimate stillness. "Returning to the state of an infant" means virtue reverts to its origin.

"Know the white, keep to the black, and be the model for the world." As the model for the world, constant virtue does not err, and one returns to the boundless.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: White illustrates the manifestation of virtue; black illustrates the return to the Dao. The sage illuminates his bright virtue yet silently unites with the Dao, without a single flaw. The world takes him as its standard and delights in following him without weariness—thus he is the model for the world. Upright and not reckless, steadfast as the four seasons, without deviation or error, such a one is difficult to exhaust or fathom, never having a limit. Hence it is said: "Constant virtue does not err, and one returns to the boundless." The *Book of Documents*, in the *Great Plan*, speaks of royal governance as "returning to its proper limit," while Laozi speaks of being the model for the world as "returning to the boundless." *Ji* (limit) means the center. "Proper limit" refers to virtue manifest in affairs, with the center as its utmost. "Boundless" refers to virtue’s return to the Dao, which cannot be attained.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: White, as a color, is unadorned; when illuminated by heaven’s light, it shines brightly. Black, as a color, is unchanging; returning to profound obscurity, it silently accords. Thus, black is what one guards, while white must not be unknown. Knowing the white yet guarding the black, one empties the self and does not rely on one’s own brightness, achieving unity and thereby uniting with the Dao. Taking this as a model, one endures without error, like the cycles of cold and heat, where heaven’s workings are not forced. Thus, "returning to the boundless"—to call it a "proper limit" is to remain centered; to call it "boundless" is to reach everywhere. Reaching everywhere is the return to the Dao.

"Know glory, keep to disgrace, and be the valley of the world." As the valley of the world, constant virtue is fulfilled, and one returns to simplicity.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Beyond nature and destiny, there is nothing that is not a thing. The people of the world regard gain as glory and loss as disgrace, prosperity as glory and restraint as disgrace. Only the sage can view glory and disgrace as one, without a mind for seeking or conforming. Yet he does not strive for extravagance but takes restraint as his principle—this is emptiness alone. Thus he is the valley of the world. The valley is empty and can receive; it responds without hoarding. When virtue reaches this point, it is complete and cannot be surpassed. Hence it is said: "Constant virtue is fulfilled." Simplicity is the whole body of the Dao. Returning to simplicity, one can fully embody the Dao. Kings and dukes call themselves "solitary," "widowed," and "barren," yet embracing simplicity, the world submits.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The sage empties himself to respond to the world. Knowing that things bring glory, he does not see what is desirable. His guard is in disgrace; he does not precede things or initiate movement, merely responding to them. Thus he is the valley of the world. His body is empty within, his responses inexhaustible. When virtue reaches this point, it suffices to nourish all things without showing beginning or end—this is the fulfillment of virtue. Simplicity is the wholeness of things, the body of the Dao. Only by fully embodying the Dao can one return to simplicity. When simplicity disperses, it becomes vessels.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called vessels. There are forms and names, divisions and responsibilities. The Dao is whole; heaven and humanity unite as one. Vessels are dispersed; heaven and humanity separate into two.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Things are simple when whole; when put to use, they become vessels. When simplicity disperses, the wholeness of the Dao is divided; when vessels are made, things are put to use. The sage employs them as officials and leaders.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The wholeness of the Dao, the sage uses to govern the self. The dispersion of the Dao, the sage uses to govern the world. There are forms that can be named, divisions that can be upheld—thus he establishes offices and leads subordinates, and the world is ordered. This is called "official and leader." The *Book of Changes* says: "Knowing the subtle and the manifest, knowing the soft and the hard—this is the aspiration of ten thousand men." This is of the same meaning.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: When the Dao is whole in simplicity, nature is one. When vessels differ in use, it is the distinction of materials. The sage establishes offices and leads subordinates, becoming their official and leader, in order to skillfully employ vessels. Thus, "great regulation is not cut apart."

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Transforming and shaping it lies in change; carving and sculpting myriad forms is not craft.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The sage employs people according to their abilities, making them leaders of the hundred officials. Yet the sage governs the world through non-action, without exerting force.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Will to Manifest**

Those who would take the world and act upon it—I see they will not succeed.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The world is a great vessel. He who possesses this great vessel cannot be treated as a vessel. To treat it as a vessel yet not be bound by it—this is how one masters all vessels. He who understands that the master of vessels is not a vessel himself, and thus does not act upon the world, may be entrusted with the world. Those who would take the world and act upon it rely on cunning and force, straying far from the Way. Thus the sage governs through the transformative power of the Dao, not through cunning or force. The Qin’s downfall through coercion—was this not its meaning?

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Where there is grasping, things may be seized; where there is action, things may be undone. The world is called the divine vessel—it cannot be taken by those with intent, nor mastered by those with strength. The sage, free of intent and returning to non-action, is thus joyfully upheld by the world without weariness.

**The World as Divine Vessel**
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Bound by form and number, confined by direction and structure, limited between heaven and earth—this is a vessel. Yet it stands beyond measure, moves without fixed direction. Those who act upon it fail; those who cling to it lose. Thus it is called the divine vessel.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: It is called divine because it has no form; it is called a vessel because it is not formless. Whether form or formless, neither can be grasped—only those who embody the Dao attain it. Only those who embody the Dao attain it; it cannot be seized by cunning or force.

**Non-Action in Governance**
The *Imperial Commentary* states: To govern the myriad things and direct all movement, there must be one who is not a vessel—only then can the world be ordered. Thus it is said: the ruler must practice non-action and employ the world.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: To be bound by vessels is to be used by those who are not vessels. To act through non-action is to have the world act for you.

**The Perils of Action and Clinging**
*Those who act upon it fail.*
The *Imperial Commentary* states: To be capable of action but not of non-action is to be ensnared by cunning. As *Zhuangzi* says: "Excessive knowledge leads to failure."

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: To act through force is to exhaust one’s strength, leading to failure.

*Those who cling to it lose it.*
The *Imperial Commentary* states: The value of the Dao lies in timing. To cling without adapting is to lose the movement of the times—this is to violate the Dao.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Time shifts without pause; the Dao transforms with it. To cling without understanding is to lose the advantage of the moment.

Thus, some things move while others follow, some exhale while others inhale, some are strong while others are weak, some are upheld while others collapse.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The principles of the myriad things: some move while others follow, like the sun and moon’s alternation. Some exhale while others inhale, like the four seasons’ succession. Some are strong while others are weak, like the waxing and waning of the five phases. Some are upheld while others collapse, like the blossoming and withering of plants. Subject to time and bound by fate, they cannot escape entanglement—only the sage is free from such burdens, standing independent above the ten thousand things. To come and go alone is called "possessing singularity." One who possesses singularity is called "most noble." Thus, in wielding the divine vessel, there is always abundance. Though the forms of things vary, the sage’s heart remains constant.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Where there is movement, there is following; where there is exhalation, there is inhalation; where there is strength, there is weakness; where there is upholding, there is collapse—this is the inherent nature of things. Only the sage, unburdened by things and standing above them, does not shift with their changes but skillfully wields the divine vessel. Therefore, the sage eliminates extremes, extravagance, and excess.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The sage observes the transformations of the myriad things and knows the many burdens of excess. Thus, he does not seek to augment life, indulge nature, or overreach. He roams within the bounds of sufficiency. How then could he suffer the failure of those who act or the loss of those who cling? Thus it is said: ornate embellishments and ostentatious displays are of no benefit to governance.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The sage understands the inherent principles of things—how movement and following, exhalation and inhalation, strength and weakness, upholding and collapse are never uniform. Thus, he knows that extremes lead to change, extravagance to distress, and excess to decline. Therefore, he strives to eliminate them, freeing himself from the burdens of excess.

---

**Chapter Thirty: Aiding the Ruler with the Dao**

One who aids a ruler with the Dao does not use military force to dominate the world.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The deployment of armies and weapons is the least of virtues. Such means existed even among the ancients, but they were not primary. One who aids a ruler with the Dao focuses on the root—thus, he does not use military force to dominate the world.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Weapons are instruments of misfortune, used to assist virtue only when unavoidable. Thus, they are the least of virtues, not the Way of Yao and Shun, and should not be displayed before the king. Therefore, one must aid the ruler with the Dao.

*Such affairs tend to rebound.*
The *Imperial Commentary* states: As Mencius said, "It will return to you."

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Strength inevitably weakens—this is the nature of things. How much more so when one seeks dominance over the world through force? Can such strength endure?

*Where armies camp, thorns and brambles grow. After great wars, lean years follow.*
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Below, they plunder the people’s strength, so thorns and brambles grow. Above, they defy the seasons, so lean years come. As the *Book of Songs* says: "Pacify the ten thousand states, and abundant years will come." To pacify the ten thousand states is to harmonize the people; when the people are harmonious, the harmony of heaven and earth responds.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Where armies camp, they destroy the people’s livelihoods, so thorns and brambles grow. After great wars, the killing energy harms the harmony of heaven, so yin and yang fall into discord, and lean years arrive.

Thus, the wise achieve their aims and stop—they do not dare to seek dominance through force.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: To seek what is possible, to achieve completion, to expend little effort and gain much—this is the Way of the sage. To overcome others through force is called a "fierce virtue." Thus, victory in war lies in harmony, not in numbers.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: To be resolute in forceful conquest is what the common people call "achievement." To dare not seek dominance but to achieve without arrogance, boasting, or pride—this is to act only when unavoidable.

Fruition without arrogance, fruition without boasting, fruition without pride, fruition only when unavoidable—this is fruition without force.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Among those who act only when unavoidable, the Way of the sage is found. Thus, armies achieve good fortune through harmony, avoid misfortune through righteousness, respond only when unavoidable, and seek only the completion of their task. Those who boast of themselves do not endure; those who praise themselves achieve nothing; those who are prideful are unworthy of regard. Embodying these four principles is how one achieves without force.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Fruition without arrogance suffices to perfect one’s abilities. Fruition without boasting suffices to accomplish great deeds. Fruition without pride ensures victory without excess. Fruition only when unavoidable ensures action without recklessness. Such is the nature of true fruition—how then could force be necessary?

All things, when they reach their peak, begin to decline.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: The transformations of summer’s growth and autumn’s decay are plain to see.
The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: What flourishes must inevitably wane—such is the nature of things. This is called "not the Way."
The *Imperial Commentary* states: The Way has no beginning or end; it does not transform with things.
The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The Way employs softness and weakness, thus enduring unchanged through past and present. Things that burden themselves with strength are born contrary to the Way.
What is not the Way perishes early.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: To stand apart from the Way is to know the difference between strength and decay.
The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Forms do not arise without the Way; to stand apart from it is to perish early.

**Chapter 31: On Fine Weaponry**
Fine weaponry is an instrument of ill omen—some things despise it, and thus those who embody the Way do not dwell with it.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: Auspicious affairs bring good fortune; weapons are instruments of misfortune, and thus are called "inauspicious." When weapons are sheathed, they are wielded only in due time. Those who embody the Way display virtue and do not parade their arms, and thus do not dwell with them.
The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Where armies camp, thorns and brambles grow; after great wars, lean years follow. Such is the inauspicious nature of these instruments—thus they are despised, and those who embody the Way do not dwell with them.

Therefore, the noble person values the left in times of peace and the right in times of war. Weapons are instruments of ill omen, not the instruments of the noble person.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: The left is yang and governs life; the right is yin and governs killing. Yang is virtue; yin is punishment. The noble person values virtue and fears punishment, and thus weapons are not their instruments.
The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Yang’s power lies in giving life, thus the left is valued. Yin’s function is killing, thus the right is valued. To exalt killing is to make an instrument of ill omen. To exalt virtue is to make the instrument of the noble person.

When weapons must be used, tranquility is paramount—thus they are not glorified. To glorify them is to delight in them. To delight in them is to delight in killing.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: To suppress violence and rescue the disordered, one acts only when compelled—thus it is unavoidable. Without the intent to conquer, tranquility is paramount. Without certainty in conquest, weapons are not a source of joy—thus they are not glorified.
The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Killing to end killing—how could it be otherwise? Weapons are not a source of joy—thus they are not glorified. Not glorifying them, tranquility is paramount.

Those who delight in killing cannot realize their ambitions in the world.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: When a ruler embraces benevolence, none in the world can oppose him. To secure what endangers others and profit from their misfortune, to delight in what brings about their ruin—this is where resentment gathers and disaster converges.
The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: To delight in killing is the height of unbenevolence. Unbenevolence leads to a thirst for slaughter, leaving people with nowhere to turn for life—thus it becomes the source of resentment and calamity.

In auspicious affairs, the left is exalted; in inauspicious affairs, the right is exalted. Thus, the deputy general stands to the left, while the supreme general stands to the right—meaning that those in positions of power are treated with the rites of mourning. When many are killed, one weeps in sorrow. When victory is won, it is treated with the rites of mourning.
The *Imperial Commentary* states: The *Book of Changes* describes armies as a poison upon the world. Even in victory, some are inevitably poisoned—thus those in positions of power and those who triumph in battle are treated with the rites of mourning.
The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The benevolent see no difference between self and other, near and far—they regard all with equal compassion. Thus, they despise fine weaponry as instruments of ill omen and treat armies with mourning rites. When many are killed, they weep in sorrow; when victory is won, they observe it with mourning rites—how could they do otherwise?

**Chapter 32: The Way Is Eternally Nameless**

**Imperial Commentary** states: The Dao is the beginning of Heaven and Earth—how could it be named?

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: That which gives birth to Heaven and Earth is the Dao. The Dao eternally abides in the nameless—what name could it possess?

Though the uncarved block is small, none under Heaven can subjugate it.
**Imperial Commentary** states: The uncarved block is an analogy for the Dao’s undivided wholeness. When form and name descend, the great governs the small. The Dao’s undivided wholeness does not depart from inherent nature. Though small, it discerns all things—what Zhuang Zhou called "the true ruler abiding within."

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Before the Dao scatters into forms and vessels, it is called the uncarved block. Subtle and small, the myriad things none do not revere it—who could subjugate it?

Should lords and kings hold fast to it, the myriad things will of themselves submit.
**Imperial Commentary** states: When the Dao suffices as the master of things, they will of themselves submit. Zhuangzi said: "In pristine simplicity, the people’s nature is preserved. They serve the myriad things without recourse to coercion or punishment—this is nearly it."

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: The Dao’s uncarved block is the undivided whole. Should lords and kings attain and hold fast to it, establishing it as the norm for all under Heaven, things will come of themselves without summons.

Returning to the nameless is the Dao. Turning toward the existent is the realm of things. Thus, the Dao is the master of things, and things submit to the Dao and return to it—therefore they are called guests.

Heaven and Earth unite to descend sweet dew. No one commands it, yet it spreads evenly of itself.
**Imperial Commentary** states: The Dao in its pure simplicity, held fast and never lost, not only causes things to submit of themselves. Above, it reaches Heaven; below, it coils through Earth. Above and below, it flows in unison with Heaven and Earth, so that communication and harmony are achieved, and the myriad things all receive its blessing. Sweet dew is the harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth. The *Tradition* says: "The virtue of emperors and kings reaches above to the Great Clarity, below to the Great Tranquility, and in between to the myriad spirits—then sweet dew descends."

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: When lords and kings attain the One and hold fast to it, they thereby harmonize the boundary between Heaven and humanity, leaving no gap. Thus, the mutual resonance of Heaven and Earth, the harmony of yin and yang, and the descent of sweet dew spread evenly throughout all under Heaven—who causes this to be so?

Once names are established, names too come into being. One must also know when to stop. Knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril.
**Imperial Commentary** states: In the sequence of the Great Dao, after five transformations, forms and names may be invoked. Once forms can be named, the Dao declines and virtue wanes. Simplicity scatters, and the uncarved block dissolves—none can halt it. The humane of the age lament the world’s calamities with anxious eyes, while the inhumane sever the bonds of their nature to glut themselves on wealth and honor. The sage is not thus. When names are first established, he does not follow things in their flux. Serene and self-sufficient, who could endanger him? Thus it is said: knowing when to stop, one avoids peril.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: The Dao, whole in the One, is the uncarved block. When the uncarved block first establishes names, names arise from the One. From the One to the ten thousand, no thing lacks a name. Rectifying names and following principle—this is how one knows when to stop. To cling to names and become mired in existence, to drift with things in their changes, to proceed without return—this is to invite the calamities of worldly entanglement, to forget the truth of nature and life, and to lose one’s place of security. How could one not be imperiled?

The Dao’s presence in all under Heaven is like streams and valleys flowing into rivers and seas.
**Imperial Commentary** states: All under Heaven is one nature. The Dao’s presence in all under Heaven unites through nature, just as streams and valleys gather into rivers and seas through water. Those of the same kind attain; those of like categories respond. When the sage presides over the world, what does he do? He follows nature, and that is all.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Nature is one, emerging from the Dao’s great wholeness. Thus, nature and the Dao are both obscured in the One. Scattered, they become streams and valleys; gathered, they become rivers and seas—what difference is there in the water?

**Chapter 33: He Who Knows Others Is Wise**
He who knows others is wise...

**Imperial Commentary** states: The *Commentaries* say: Wisdom is like the eye—it can see a hundred paces away but cannot see its own lashes. Discerning others’ crookedness or uprightness, distinguishing black from white, is the work of wisdom in knowing others.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: To know others through one’s private perceptions and grasp their true nature is called wisdom. Though wisdom arises from Heaven, human effort plays a part. Thus, one remains blind to one’s own perceptions. He who knows himself is enlightened.

**Imperial Commentary** states: The *Book of Changes* says: "Returning to oneself is self-knowledge." The *Commentaries* say: "Inward vision is called enlightenment." Wisdom in knowing others engages with the external, entangling the mind in the world. Returning to self-knowledge is stillness that reverts to the root, seeing oneself alone—this is the mirror of Heaven and Earth, the illumination of the ten thousand things.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Knowing things leads to chasing illusions; knowing oneself returns to the root. Returning to the root is emptiness, unity, and stillness. Only in stillness is there clarity—sufficient to mirror Heaven and Earth, to illuminate the ten thousand things.

He who overcomes others is strong; he who overcomes himself is mighty.

**Imperial Commentary** states: The perfected person values virtue over strength, strives to overcome the self rather than others. Cunning the wise into foolishness, emboldening the brave to cowardice—this is overcoming others, relying on force. Overcoming one’s private desires, nurturing uprightness without harm—this is overcoming the self. Outwardly, one stands alone without fear; inwardly, one withdraws from the world without distress. Going anywhere, one is invincible—this is what it means to be mighty.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Overcoming others relies on force; overcoming the self relies on might. Overcoming others means others may one day not be overcome; overcoming the self means nothing can oppose it—hence, it is called mighty. When desires reach their peak, when profit and harm grind against each other, when power and might descend, when wealth and nobility tempt, when poverty and lowliness press, when life and death compel—nothing sways the heart. This is what is meant by overcoming the self.

He who knows contentment is rich.

**Imperial Commentary** states: To possess myriad differences is called richness. He who knows contentment focuses on inner wandering and finds sufficiency within. All things are complete; kingdom and wealth are as one.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: He who does not know contentment endlessly seeks with insatiable desire, never finding satisfaction. Finding sufficiency within and needing nothing from without—what richness could surpass this?

He who acts with perseverance has resolve.

**Imperial Commentary** states: Unceasing self-striving is the resolve for the Dao.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Strength in overcoming the self, acting without cease—such is the resolve for the Dao.

He who does not lose his place endures.

**Imperial Commentary** states: Standing firm without changing direction, one endures in the Dao. Those who shift with time and move with things endure but briefly.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Embracing the One without departure, guarding qi without disorder, spirit whole and wandering in the origin of things—thus one returns to the constancy of the Dao.

He who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.

**Imperial Commentary** states: Life has its sprouting; death has its return. Tracing origins and reverting to endings, one understands the discourse on life and death. The sage comprehends the Dao of day and night, knowing that death is not fundamentally different from life. Thus, when the form dissolves, the spirit does not perish—it merges with Heaven and Earth, its limit unknown. What is this if not long life? The meaning of this chapter begins with knowing others to exhaust principle, centers on knowing contentment to fulfill nature, and concludes with non-perishing to reach destiny. Then creation lies within oneself. Who but one who transcends past and present, entering the realm of neither death nor life, could achieve this?

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Where there is life, there is death; where there is death, there is life. Life and death are like the changes of morning and evening. All things that enter and exit transformation are thus. The sage understands the transformations of life and death, comprehends the principles of day and night. Though the body follows change, the awakened nature remains serene, its limit unknown. The deluded and ignorant, clinging to confusion, though alive, are as if dead. Those who perceive broadly, forgetting the form, keep spirit whole in the One. Seeing no end or beginning, though one may speak of death, who knows its perishing? Thus, it is called long life.

**Chapter 34: The Great Dao Flows Everywhere**
The great Dao flows everywhere—it may be grasped to the left or right.

**Imperial Commentary** states: Flowing without attachment, thus movement and stillness are not lost, coming and going are inexhaustible. Left or right—nothing is beyond its reach.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: The Dao is present in all things, thus it flows without restriction. Left or right—what attachment could there be?

The ten thousand things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse. Its work complete, it does not dwell.

**Imperial Commentary** states: Those who depart rely on it; those who seek receive from it. The ten thousand things take form and transform, gain wisdom and strength, yet it does not claim its work. Like the four seasons, when its work is done, it departs.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Zhuangzi said: "Without the Dao, forms do not arise." Thus, the Dao is what the ten thousand things rely on to live. The Dao gives life to the ten thousand things yet never refuses. It gives life to what naturally arises, completes what naturally comes to be—what work is there to claim? It clothes and covers the ten thousand things yet does not act as their master, thus it is ever without desire—it may be called small.

The ten thousand things return to it yet do not know it as their master—it may be called great.

**Imperial Commentary** states: When the Dao returns to utmost subtlety, it is small, distinguishing itself from things. When it manifests in utmost change, it is great, interacting with things. Distinguishing itself, it is ever without desire; interacting with things, the ten thousand things return to it. It blankets the ten thousand things yet does not display its governing power—thus it does not act as master. It animates the multitude yet none glimpse its path of return—thus they do not know it as master. The Dao cannot be named as small or great. What can be named is only the Dao’s reach toward things.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: The Dao pervades the ten thousand things yet hides in utmost nothingness, never emerging to master them—thus it is said not to act as master.

Ever without desire, it distinguishes itself from things and returns to utmost subtlety—thus it is named "small." The ten thousand things dance in the Dao and return to it, yet never know how it acts as master. Interacting with things, it manifests in utmost change, yet things cannot comprehend it—thus it may be named "great." That which does not act as master is the Dao; that which does not know the master is things. Things are insufficient to know the Dao, and what can be seen of it is only its boundless greatness.

Therefore, the sage never acts as great, and so accomplishes greatness.

**Imperial Commentary** states: One whose merit blankets the world yet seems not to originate from oneself—thus their enterprise is great and all-encompassing. Mencius said: "Great and transformed—this is called sageliness." Being great yet able to transform, how could there be the burden of striving for greatness? This is how one accomplishes greatness.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: The Dao, by not acting as master, causes the ten thousand things to return to it without knowing—thus it may be named "great." Therefore, the sage does not exalt themselves, and so accomplishes greatness, for they embody the Dao.

**Chapter 35: Holding to the Great Image**
Hold to the great image, and all under heaven will come.
**Imperial Commentary** states: The image is like the celestial bodies suspended in the sky—it acts not, yet moves with vigor; it speaks not, yet displays its patterns. The sage’s governance of the world abides in non-action, practices the teaching without words, and the people turn to them as to parents. Thus it is said: "Hold to the great image, and all under heaven will come."

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: "Great" implies form; "image" implies likeness—hence the use of "hold." The sage embodies the Dao in non-action, so what is there to hold? Yet in emerging to order the world, the Dao’s movement and the patterns it displays indeed form an image. Holding to this image without revealing its traces, all under heaven are transformed by the Dao—thus they become the world’s destination. This image originates in the Dao, so it is called "great."

Coming yet unharmed,
**Imperial Commentary** states: Yin and yang harmonize in stillness; ghosts and spirits are not disturbed; the multitude of beings are not injured; the ten thousand things do not perish prematurely. Though the people possess knowledge, they have no use for it—what harm could there be?

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: When all under heaven come, those who follow in traces are many. Governing through traces is what brings harm. The sage acts not from above yet fulfills the natural course of the ten thousand things. All beings grow spontaneously, unaware of their origin; all attain fulfillment, unaware of how they receive it. Thus between heaven and earth, whether in the hidden realms of yin and yang and ghosts and spirits or in the manifest realms of the multitude of beings and the people, each follows its nature. There is no place they go that is not beneficial—thus it is said "unharmed."

Secure, peaceful, and at ease.
**Imperial Commentary** states: Secure, then there is no fear of danger or ruin; peaceful, then there is no peril of steep slopes or uneven ground; at ease means unobstructed and well-ordered.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Coming yet unharmed, there is no place they go that is not naturally secure. Secure, they attain peace and align with the Dao—this is the Dao’s state of ease. Thus, security leads to peace, and peace leads to ease.

Music and delicacies make the passing traveler stop.
**Imperial Commentary** states: Those delighted by sounds and flavors are the world’s people, entangled by things and unable to free themselves. Things bind them, so they stop.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Music moves people through sound; delicacies please the mouth through taste. By what they find beautiful, they influence others, and the heart is detained—so unable to free themselves.

The Dao’s spoken words are bland, seemingly without flavor.
Looked at, they cannot be seen; listened to, they cannot be heard; used, they cannot be exhausted.
**Imperial Commentary** states: What can be tasted has been tasted, yet that which tastes the taste has never appeared—thus it is bland, seemingly without flavor. What can be seen as color has been displayed, yet that which colors the color has never manifested—thus looked at, it cannot be seen. What can be heard as sound has been heard, yet that which sounds the sound has never been uttered—thus listened to, it cannot be heard. Such is it: it can be bitter or sweet, black or yellow, gong or shang. Without knowledge, yet nothing is unknown; without ability, yet nothing is unachievable—thus used, it cannot be exhausted.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: The utmost Dao is without flavor, without sight, without sound, yet returns to utmost nothingness. Responding to being from non-being, it arises from essence to function—thus used, it cannot be exhausted.

**Chapter 36: When About to Contract It**
When about to contract it, you must first expand it.
When about to weaken it, you must first strengthen it.
When about to abolish it, you must first exalt it.
When about to take it away, you must first give it.
**Imperial Commentary** states: Yin and yang illuminate each other, alternately covering and ordering one another. The four seasons succeed each other, alternately generating and destroying. The principles of the ten thousand things and the traditions of human relations—whether in their gathering or scattering, their flourishing or decline, their sudden rise or their waning and waxing—always emerge from the subtlest beginnings, and none perceive their signs. Only the sage who studies these subtleties attains foresight of good fortune; the worthy merely approach this ability.

Yang flourishes in summer, yet yin is born at noon; yin congeals in winter, yet yang is born at midnight. Goujian sought to exhaust Wu, so he urged them to attack Qi; Zhibo sought to raid Chouyou, so he presented them with broad chariots. This is how the sage treads on frost and knows the coming of solid ice—observing the ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness, not confined to their forms. Thus, the brave cannot weaken them, and the wise cannot seize from them.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: The movement of yin and yang, the principles of the ten thousand things—whether in their flourishing or decline, strength or weakness, fullness or waning, success or failure—revolve endlessly, always with subtle signs emerging from the most minute. The sage studies these signs and attains foresight—thus they achieve subtle clarity. Therefore, firmly expanding it contracts its expansion; firmly strengthening it weakens its strength. If their rise is unjust, then firmly exalting it will cause its power to abolish itself. If their taking is improper, then firmly giving to them will cause their possession to be seized of itself. Thus, when hardness and strength lie with the other, and softness and weakness with oneself, the strong will surely break—this is the natural principle.

The sage responds to the myriad changes, accomplishes the world’s affairs, yet none know how this comes to be—it is by this Way. This is called *subtle clarity*.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: That which has not yet shown signs is *subtle*, yet its principle is most evident. Yang Xiong said: "When water stills, the depths become clear; when trees wither, the branches fade. The worthy perceive it, yet the multitude does not."

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Within the formless, one alone discerns what is present—so subtle is this that the principles of the ten thousand things lie hidden within it. By studying the subtle and attaining foresight, by delving into the profound and grasping it, one achieves utmost clarity. The worthy one’s function is one with creation, yet how could the multitude comprehend it? The contraction and expansion, the weakening and strengthening, the rise and fall, the giving and seizing—such is *subtle clarity*. The soft overcomes the hard; the weak overcomes the strong.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Only the sage can amass countless small victories to achieve great triumph. The *Classic* says: "Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet nothing surpasses it in attacking the hard and strong." The *Outer Chapters* of the *Zhuangzi* discuss the mutual admiration of the *kui*, the louse, and the wind: "Point to me, and you surpass me; follow me, and you surpass me. Yet only I can snap great trees and topple grand houses."

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: To overcome hardness with hardness is to ensure that hardness breaks; to restrain strength with strength is to ensure mutual harm. The soft does not contend, yet nothing contends with it. The weak does not oppose, yet nothing opposes it. Thus, hardness and strength are instead overcome by softness and weakness—such is the principle and the natural tendency.

Fish cannot leave the depths; a state’s *sharp instruments* must not be shown to others.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: The depths are where fish conceal themselves; *sharp instruments* are how a state controls others. A fish that swallows boats, once stranded and bereft of water, may be tormented by ants—thus it cannot leave the depths. If a ruler displays rewards, ministers will exploit his favor; if he displays punishments, they will seize his authority. Rewards and punishments are tools of governance, yet even these must not be shown—how much less the Way of governance? The sage wields *sharp instruments* without displaying them, not by relying on strength, but by possessing a wondrous Way. He exhausts the realm without acquiring a reputation for wisdom, subdues the ten thousand things without earning merit for courage. He does not strive to conquer things yet attains the constant Way of victory.

Yang opens and yin closes; transformations are endless. He steers the ministers, governs the world, yet none can fathom him. Thus, he controls others without being controlled by them. The root lies above; the essential lies with the ruler—then the world is well-ordered.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Fish conceal themselves in the deep abyss; if they leave it, they are controlled by others. A state conceals its *sharp instruments*; if it displays them, others may fathom and thus cannot be controlled. The sage operates the mechanism of transformation in unfathomable ways, wielding supreme authority to adapt to change. He governs the world, commands the myriad movements, yet his divine virtue and wondrous Way remain beyond the reach of all—none can glimpse their bounds. Even his reputation for wisdom and merit for courage cannot be described, so how could the tools of governance, rewards and punishments, ever be inverted and wielded against him?

**Chapter 37: The Dao Constantly Takes No Action**

The Dao constantly takes no action, yet there is nothing it does not do.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Still and unmoving, yet when it responds, it penetrates all affairs under heaven.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The Dao constantly takes no action—this is the essence of the Dao. Yet there is nothing it does not do—this is the function of the Dao. The Dao does not act, yet naturally accords with the ten thousand things, accomplishing all without exception.

Should the lords and kings be able to hold to it, the ten thousand things will transform of themselves.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: When a mirror’s water meets forms, it does not employ cleverness, yet the square, round, curved, and straight cannot escape it. If lords and kings hold to the Dao to govern the world, they enter the realm of non-action, yet their actions arise from non-action. They bestow transformation upon the ten thousand things, and the ten thousand things are transformed by it—like nature acting of itself, unaware of who acts. Thus, it is called *self-transformation*.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: How does Heaven speak? The four seasons proceed, and the myriad things are nurtured. If lords and kings embody the Dao and emulate Heaven, governing through non-action, they do not abandon what must be done. They appear to accomplish all without acting, for they follow the principles of things and ride the timely moment. What do *I* do? The Dao guards it for me. I transform the ten thousand things with the Dao, and the ten thousand things are transformed by the Dao, yet none know who acts—thus it is called *self-transformation*.

If, in the midst of transformation, desire arises, I will suppress it with the nameless uncarved block.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Mencius said: "Those who wait for King Wen before they rise are ordinary people." The people merely follow the ruler’s transformation. If desire arises, they depart from the Dao to pursue goodness, act with perilous virtue, abandon their nature to follow their hearts—this is insufficient to stabilize the world. Only the Dao is nameless, simple and undivided, so those who act are suppressed by it. Nothing is better than loyalty to rescue the hasty—this is why.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: When the ruler transforms the world with the Dao, the ten thousand things are transformed by the Dao the ruler holds, yet none know how they are transformed. They will return to the constancy of nature and destiny, all alike arising from the realm of non-action—thus it is called *transformation*. To act is to engage in action; if desire arises, it will incline toward action and flow into artifice. With the nameless uncarved block, I steady their resolve, extinguish their delusive desires, and restore them to the wholeness of Heaven’s nature.

The nameless uncarved block will also have no desires.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Ji Zhen’s "non-action" is but one aspect of things; among the ancient arts of the Dao, some resided in this. Yet few can fully embody the form of Heaven and Earth—thus, it will also have no desires. This is how Laozi dispels confusion and removes obstructions.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: The Dao is a forced name. To forget the totality of what one guards, to loosen the heart that desires to act—this is the nameless uncarved block. The nameless uncarved block will also have no desires, so that even the desire for non-desire is forgotten.

To forget what one has forgotten is to return to the state of no-thing.
When self and things are originally the same, what desires could there be?
Through non-desire one attains stillness, and the world will of itself become upright.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: When water is still, it levels even the most precise measuring tool—thus the great craftsman takes it as his model. Through non-desire one attains stillness, and so does not lose the upright; this begins with the self, and thus the world will of itself become upright. The *Book of Changes* says: "The Qian Dao transforms and changes, each rectifying its nature and destiny." The Qian Dao transforms and changes—this is non-action; each rectifies its nature and destiny—this is through non-desire one attains stillness, and the world will of itself become upright. To govern the world with the Dao, reaching the point where each rectifies its nature and destiny—this is called the ultimate governance.

The *Minister’s Exegesis* states: Without desire, the heart returns to nothingness; through stillness, emptiness unifies and becomes upright—first the self is rectified, and thus the world will of itself become upright. When the world reaches the point where each rectifies its nature and destiny, this is the ultimate achievement of Daoist governance.

*Exegesis on the True Meaning of the Dao and Its Virtue by Emperor Huizong of Song, Scroll Five Concluded*
*Exegesis on the True Meaning of the Dao and Its Virtue by Emperor Huizong of Song, Scroll Six*

Ministerial Exegete, Gentleman for Court Service, Zhang An’s Exegesis on the *Virtue Classic*

The Imperial Commentary states: The Dao has no fixed form or substance, while virtue may be complete or deficient. When united with the Dao, virtue is without virtue and may be named; when distinguished from virtue, it has names that may be discerned. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are received according to measure and applied according to the times—these are merely aspects of virtue. Those who embody the Dao differ from this, and thus are placed in the latter section of the classic.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: The Dao is but a forced name, returning to constant nothingness, and thus has no fixed form or substance. Virtue is that which is obtained, inheriting the Dao’s loss, and thus may be complete or deficient. When virtue is without attainment, merging with unified governance, then virtue and the Dao blend into namelessness. When virtue is attained through self-interest, then virtue and the Dao become distinctly discernible. Those who attain it as transformation are benevolent; those who attain it as principle are righteous; those who embody it as ritual are proper; those who embody it as knowledge are wise. Virtue’s reception and application have names that may be discerned, yet they drift far from the Dao. Only those who fully embody virtue truly attain nothing, and thus never depart from the Dao.

**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Highest Virtue Does Not Act as Virtue**

The highest virtue does not act as virtue, and thus possesses virtue.

The Imperial Commentary states: That by which things obtain life is called virtue. When all equally attain it, silently harmonizing with the Dao, erring without regret and acting rightly without self-satisfaction—this is called *not acting as virtue*. Confucius did not dwell in his sageliness but acted as a sage in due time, and thus possessed virtue.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: Things are born of the Dao, each attaining it in its own way. When virtue is complete in nature, it merges with the Dao as one, never having differed from it. Without attaining the Dao, the Dao naturally attains itself—thus virtue pervades the myriad things without encumbrance.

The lesser virtue does not lose virtue, and thus is without virtue.

The Imperial Commentary states: Claiming and possessing it, acting with self-interest to lose the Dao—what virtue is there in this?

The Minister’s Exegesis states: Taking virtue as attainment and attainment as grasping, holding to it without loss—this is far removed from the Dao.

The highest virtue acts without acting.

The Imperial Commentary states: Without thought, one attains; without effort, one hits the mark; without action, one reaches the goal—this is the highest virtue.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: Without acting, one attains nothing of the Dao; attaining nothing of the Dao, one returns to ultimate nothingness, and thus acts without acting.

The lesser virtue acts with purpose.

The Imperial Commentary states: Without thought, one does not attain; without effort, one does not hit the mark; without action, one does not reach the goal—this is the lesser virtue. Is this not the division between the sage and the worthy?

Transcending form and relinquishing knowledge, one merges with the great unity. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom—though one seeks to simplify them, they cannot be discarded, and thus one acts without acting. Bending to rituals and music, uttering sighs of approval and reproach, one comforts the hearts of the world. Attaining what others attain without attaining it oneself—thus one acts with purpose.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: With action comes attainment, and with attainment of the Dao, one cannot remain without acting, for circumstances compel it.

The highest benevolence acts without acting.

The Imperial Commentary states: Yao and Shun’s benevolence was innate, covering the world without seeking profit—thus they acted without acting.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: Virtue admits all without exclusion, and benevolence flows forth without contrivance—thus it acts without acting.

The highest righteousness acts with purpose.

The Imperial Commentary states: Measuring the enemy and assessing what is fitting is called righteousness. Establishing oneself and regulating affairs—can one remain without acting?

The Minister’s Exegesis states: With oneself to establish and affairs to regulate, where benevolence is insufficient, the Dao lacks no principle—thus righteousness’s achievements are manifest and cannot cease.

The highest propriety acts, yet none respond, so one rolls up one’s sleeves and forces compliance.

The Imperial Commentary states: Ritual is for interacting with others, demonstrating to people the patterns of benevolence and righteousness—its uses are many. Yet if none reciprocate after one has exhausted one’s offerings, then resentment and contention arise, leading to disorder. In the Spring and Autumn period, a single unanswered word or an improper bow could cause two states to shed blood—rolling up one’s sleeves and forcing compliance is but a minor calamity. The sage values benevolence and devalues righteousness; ritual is but a means to practice them, not the proper path. Thus, the highest benevolence is akin to virtue, the highest righteousness acts with purpose, and the highest propriety meets with no response.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: Ritual bends to prevent affairs and establish regulations, manifesting the patterns of benevolence and righteousness through deportment. Though named a tool to halt transgression, it still demands reciprocity and precedence in exchange. Its complexity breeds mutual reproach—this is truly the root of contention and chaos. Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows; when virtue is lost, benevolence follows; when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows; when righteousness is lost, propriety follows. Ritual is the thinning of loyalty and trust, and the beginning of chaos.

The Imperial Commentary states: The Dao cannot be attained, so when the Dao is lost, virtue follows. Virtue cannot be perfected, so when virtue is lost, benevolence follows. Benevolence can be enacted, and enacting it approaches righteousness—thus when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows. Righteousness can be diminished, and when diminished, it is adorned with ritual—thus when righteousness is lost, propriety follows. By the time propriety arises, one has drifted ever farther from the Dao, and what is lost grows ever more numerous. No two things flourish simultaneously—this is like yin and yang. Principle alternates between yielding and contending—this is like might and virtue. Where substance is abundant, appearance is meager—this is like the ritual between father and son. From this, we see that where ritual is elaborate, substance must decline. When substance declines, pretense follows, and contention and chaos arise. Thus, ritual is the thinning of loyalty and trust, and the beginning of chaos.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: Attaining the Dao is the Dao’s loss. Acting through benevolence is virtue’s loss. Mutual dependence and mutual sustenance are transformation’s loss. Establishing regulations and boundaries is righteousness’s loss. Form obscures essence, and breadth drowns the heart—thus loyalty and trust thin. What ritual regulates is external; what it attends to is superficial; what it constrains is its elaborate patterns—thus what it originates from is but the tip. This is how emptiness and pretense daily increase, becoming the beginning of chaos.

The one who relies on foreknowledge is the flower of the Dao and the beginning of folly.

The Imperial Commentary states: The Dao descends and emerges, and from this emergence, knowledge arises. Using knowledge as a chisel, one carves and sharpens it, exhausting the spirit and recklessly conjecturing—this is called foreknowledge. Foreknowledge pursues the tip while forgetting the root, thus it is the flower of the Dao. The heart labors and knowledge grows ever more entangled, thus it is the beginning of folly. Even if one’s guesses often hit the mark, this is why Confucius despised Zigong.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: The Dao takes not-knowing and not-recognizing as its root and values acting without reliance on knowledge; thus, wisdom and craft are but its tip. The flower is the tip of grasses and trees—when the flower flourishes, the root must decline. To attend to wisdom and craft, to anticipate affairs with foreknowledge, is to drift far from the root, thus it is the flower of the Dao. To regard knowledge as wisdom is the very reason it becomes the beginning of folly. Therefore, the great man abides in thickness, not thinness; dwells in substance, not its flower. Thus, he discards that and selects this.

The Imperial Commentary states: That which lies in "that" is what the Dao abandons; that which lies in "this" is what the Dao esteems. What the Dao esteems is thick and not thin, substantial and without flower. Unless one’s wisdom suffices for self-knowledge, returning to the original nature and not drifting into the tip-habits of things, who could achieve this? The *Book of Changes* says, "Sincere return brings no regret," for the center is where one examines oneself. "Sincere" is the utmost of thickness. That which is thick in man from birth is his nature. To return to one’s nature is to abide in thickness—this is how the great man embodies the Dao and models virtue.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: "This" is what lies within me—it is the root of the Dao. "That" is what lies in things—it is the tip of the Dao. The root is spoken of as thick and substantial; the tip is spoken of as thin and flowery. Selecting "this" is how one abides in thickness and dwells in substance; discarding "that" is how one does not abide in thinness nor dwell in its flower. Knowing what to discard and what to select—this is called the great man.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: Those of Old Who Obtained the One**

Those of old who obtained the One:
Heaven obtained the One and became clear;
Earth obtained the One and became tranquil;
The spirits obtained the One and became numinous;
The valleys obtained the One and became full;
The myriad things obtained the One and came to life;
The lords and kings obtained the One and became the norm for all under heaven.
Their attainment was the same One.

The Imperial Commentary states: *Zhuangzi* says, "When one is through with the One, the myriad affairs are complete." Governing by the One leaves no room for duality; embracing the One leaves no room for departure; guarding the One leaves no room for change. To know the One is to know all things; not to know the One is to know nothing. Those of old who obtained the One embodied the utmost essence of all under heaven—nothing could match it. Thus, that which stands firm above is pure and unadulterated; that which rests stable below is still and unchanging. The most recondite and formless are the spirits—they obtain the One and are not obscured. The most empty and responsive are the valleys—they obtain the One and are not exhausted. The myriad things transform essence into form, thus they obtain the One and live. The lords and kings alone govern the many, thus they obtain the One and become the norm for all under heaven. From heaven and earth to the lords and kings, though their positions differ above and below, and their natures scatter between the hidden and the manifest, yet what makes heaven clear, earth tranquil, and lords and kings the norm for all under heaven is nothing sought from without nor imposed from outside. It is simply their attainment of the One. Thus it is said, "Their attainment was the same One."

The Minister’s Exegesis states: "Those of old" refers to antiquity; "now" refers to the present. Antiquity speaks of a time not far removed from the Dao, when heaven, earth, spirits, valleys, and lords and kings all took the Dao as their root. Thus, speaking of the One in terms of "those of old" refers to the uncarved block of the Dao. Utterly empty, undifferentiated, and perfectly whole, its essence undispersed, its qi returned to the primordial—thus heaven obtained it and was pure and unadulterated, its substance clear. Earth obtained it and was still and unchanging, its substance tranquil. The most recondite spirits obtained it and their numinosity was not obscured. The most empty valleys obtained it and their fullness was inexhaustible. The myriad things obtained it and their essence was whole, their life complete. The lords and kings obtained it and became the norm for all under heaven. All took the Dao as their root—thus their attainment was the same One.

If heaven had nothing by which to be clear, it would fear splitting;
If earth had nothing by which to be tranquil, it would fear bursting;
If the spirits had nothing by which to be numinous, they would fear fading;
If the valleys had nothing by which to be full, they would fear drying up;
If the myriad things had nothing by which to live, they would fear perishing;
If the lords and kings had nothing by which to be the norm and esteemed their high position, they would fear toppling.

The Imperial Commentary states: Heaven’s duty is to cover and give life; earth’s duty is to shape and bear. If it splits, it can no longer cover; if it bursts, it can no longer bear. Spirits rely on man to act—if they fade, they have nothing to show. Valleys receive but do not store—if they dry up, none can respond to them. When essence and qi gather, they become things—this is why they obtain the One and live. When they scatter, their wandering souls transform—this is why they lose the One and perish. Only the norm can govern the myriad changes and stand independent above the myriad things. If one has nothing by which to be the norm yet esteems one’s high position, one will be insufficient to preserve oneself—how could one not topple?

The Minister’s Exegesis states: Heaven is clear through the One—without it, it would split and be unable to broadly cover. Earth is tranquil through the One—without it, it would burst and be unable to deeply bear. Spirits are numinous through the One—without it, they would fade and have nothing to show. Valleys are full through the One—without it, they would dry up and be unable to respond. The myriad things live through the One—without it, they would perish. Lords and kings are the norm through the One—without it, they would topple. Thus, the noble takes the humble as its root; the high takes the low as its foundation.

The Imperial Commentary states: The humble is what the noble relies upon for stability; the low is what the high arises from. The common people see the tip, but the sage probes the root; the common people see the outcome, but the sage examines the subtle. Thus, he always attains the One.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: The noble who forgets the humble courts collapse; the high who forgets the low courts danger. Thus, lords and kings refer to themselves as "the solitary," "the few," and "the unworthy." Is this not taking the humble as their root? Is it not?

The Imperial Commentary states: "Solitary," "few," and "unworthy"—these are names of lowliness, yet lords and kings adopt them as their titles, knowing their root and nothing more. Is this not why lords and kings remain noble and exalted without peril?

The Minister’s Exegesis states: Lords and kings know their root lies in lowliness, so they style themselves "the solitary," "the few," and "the unworthy," never burdening themselves with claims of nobility or loftiness. Thus they preserve their true nobility. Therefore, those who seek frequent praise gain no praise at all.

The Imperial Commentary states: One who exalts himself to surpass others, who vaunts his nobility to belittle others, who clings to strength without knowing to guard with softness, who clings to whiteness without knowing to guard with blackness—such a one seeks praise in the world and attracts excessive acclaim, but praise beyond what is deserved soon draws baseless slander. Thus, he gains no true praise.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: One who knows the One knows the root, and so can humble and lower himself, concealing his utmost nobility. If one exalts and esteems himself, seeking praise repeatedly, how can he escape baseless slander? He does not desire to gleam like jade or stand alone like stone.

The Imperial Commentary states: Jade is prized and stone is base, each fixed and unchanging. The sage rides the moment and responds to things without stagnation; though the myriad changes are ceaseless, his heart remains constant in the One. This is true attainment of the One, and thus he cannot be deemed noble or base. Mencius said: "What is detestable about clinging to the One is that it clings to one while abandoning the hundred." Not to desire to gleam like jade or stand alone like stone—none but the sage who knows transformation can reach this, and this is called supreme virtue.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: Jade and stone are by nature fixed in the One and unchanging. To be one and unable to change is the way of things, not what is meant by attaining the One. One who attains the One bends to respond to the myriad changes, endlessly adapting without stagnation, yet his heart never strays from the One. Who then can deem him noble or base? To be prized like jade or scorned like stone—jade and stone cannot change, so their nobility and baseness are already fixed. This is not what it means to be permeated by the One. Thus, it is said: do not desire this.

Chapter Forty: Reversion is the movement of the Dao
Reversion is the movement of the Dao; weakness is the function of the Dao. The myriad things under heaven are born of being; being is born of non-being.

The Imperial Commentary states: The principles of heaven and earth move and rest in mutual dependence; strength and weakness complement each other. The teeming things, each returning to its root, have already gone forth and reverted to utmost stillness. Yet when stimulated, they penetrate all causes under heaven, and movement becomes none other than the self. Thus it is said: reversion is the movement of the Dao. The soft overcoming the hard, the weak overcoming the strong—here lies the marvelous function of the Dao. Zhuangzi said: "To accumulate many small non-victories into a great victory—only the sage can do this." Thus it is said: weakness is the function of the Dao. The progression of the four seasons withdraws and stores in winter, then flourishes and blooms in spring. Water’s nature is utterly soft, yet in attacking the hard and strong, none can surpass it. Does this not illustrate the point? Being and non-being give rise to each other like a cycle. Thus, non-being moves and generates being; being reaches its limit and returns to non-being, like east and west opposing yet unable to exist without each other. Those deluded by "non-action" or drowned in "some agency"—can this be the Dao?

The Minister’s Exegesis states: The Dao takes emptiness and stillness as its norm, so it regards movement as reversion. Movement departs from stillness yet returns to stillness—this is returning to the root and reverting to the origin, the movement of the Dao. The Dao takes non-contention as its victory, so it takes weakness as its function. The soft overcoming the hard, the weak overcoming the strong—here the marvelous function of the Dao resides. The myriad things under heaven arise from utmost non-being, are born as being, manifest in being, then return to non-being. Non-being in turn generates being—thus being and non-being revolve in mutual generation, unable to exist without each other.

Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Person Hears of the Dao
The superior person hears of the Dao and diligently practices it.

The Imperial Commentary states: The scholar is one who is devoted to the Dao. The superior person hears of the Dao and, through sincere accumulation and enduring effort, practices it with unceasing sincerity.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: The superior person is one whose aspiration for the Dao is steadfast and whose faith in it is profound, thus exerting effort in practice to attain realization.

The middling person hears of the Dao and remains in a state of uncertainty, now present, now absent.

The Imperial Commentary states: The middling person harbors doubt. When doubt arises, the will becomes divided, and in relation to the Dao, one moment departs from it, the next returns to it.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: The middling person’s perception of the Dao is unclear, hence their faith in it is not steadfast.

The inferior person hears of the Dao and laughs greatly at it—without such laughter, it would not be the Dao.

The Imperial Commentary states: The inferior person lacks sufficient faith and wisdom to grasp or comprehend it, thus they laugh.

The Dao possesses no form, color, sound, or flavor that can be apprehended, and thus it lies far beyond the desires of the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. Zhuangzi said: "Great sounds do not enter the ears of the vulgar; lofty words do not lodge in the hearts of the multitude."

The Minister’s Exegesis states: The inferior person is ensnared by things and turns away from the Dao, mistaking illusory phenomena for reality and regarding the supreme Dao as empty and false. Hearing of the Dao’s greatness, they laugh and do not believe. Yet the Dao is not diminished by the laughter of the inferior person, nor would it be the Dao if it were.

Thus the established saying goes:
The luminous Dao appears obscure.
The Imperial Commentary states: Like the light of the sun and moon illuminating the earth below—this is brightness. Yet the profound wisdom of the origin does not display itself; it conceals its radiance and does not shine forth, thus appearing obscure.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: Bright as the light of the sun and moon, obscure as the darkness of the valley—brightness returns to non-brightness, for it does not employ brightness, thus appearing obscure.

The level Dao appears uneven.
The Imperial Commentary states: Though paths differ, they converge in the same destination; though policies vary, they share a single purpose.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: Levelness is true evenness, yet unevenness seems to halt progress. The Dao takes non-levelness as its levelness, thus appearing flawed.

Advancing in the Dao appears as retreat.
The Imperial Commentary states: Yan Hui advanced by retreating; Zhuangzi spoke of "sitting in forgetfulness."

The Minister’s Exegesis states: The practice of the Dao is called "diminishing," thus it appears as retreat.

Supreme virtue resembles a valley.
The Imperial Commentary states: Empty yet responsive, responding without exhaustion; empty yet receptive, receiving without hoarding. The *Classic* states: "Be a valley to the world, and constant virtue will be sufficient."

The Minister’s Exegesis states: Empty yet all-embracing—this is embodying the Dao, hence it is called supreme virtue. Capable of response and reception, thus it resembles a valley.

Great whiteness appears tarnished.
The Imperial Commentary states: Purifying the profound mirror, not perceiving a single flaw—this is great whiteness. Yet it dwells where the multitude abhors, thus appearing tarnished.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: Great whiteness is unstained by color, pure to the utmost. Appearing tarnished refers to its capacity to receive defilement.

Vast virtue appears insufficient.
The Imperial Commentary states: Virtue embraces all without self-regard for abundance, thus appearing insufficient. When the autumn waters arrive, the River Earl rejoices—yet this is why he is ridiculed by those of great understanding.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: The capacity of virtue is boundless, truly limitless—yet it appears insufficient. This is the ever-expanding nature of virtue, aligning with the inexhaustible Dao.

Established virtue appears indolent.
The Imperial Commentary states: The sage hesitates before acting, yet every endeavor succeeds.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: The sage acts only when unavoidable; when establishing something, they follow the time and yield to spontaneity, appearing indolent and negligent, not hastening in their affairs. Thus the virtue they establish becomes all the greater.

True essence appears altered.
The Imperial Commentary states: Is it not said to be firm? Yet it is ground but not worn thin. Is it not said to be white? Yet it is steeped but not blackened.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: Still and unified, unchanging—pristine in its purity. The essence is preserved in oneness, complete in its truth. Though myriad changes arise, its essence remains ever true—this is the perfection of truth. Yet when truth reaches its utmost, the world does not recognize it as truth, for its concealment runs deep, thus it appears altered.

The great square has no corners.
The Imperial Commentary states: The great square is the square without square. Square yet not cutting, thus it has no corners.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: To speak of a square with corners is to speak of it as a vessel. The great square without corners is the boundless square of the Dao.

The great vessel is slow to complete.
The Imperial Commentary states: The great vessel is the vessel without vessel. It does not hasten growth nor force development, thus it is slow to complete.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: Only the great vessel possesses far-reaching foresight and does not seek swift completion, thus it neither hastens growth nor forces development. To rush toward utility is the way of shallow vessels.

The great tone is rarely heard.
The Imperial Commentary states: Moving without fixed direction, yet responding when stimulated—thus it is rarely heard.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: The great tone is the unheard resonance of virtue, thus its sound is rare.

The great image has no form.
The Imperial Commentary states: Entrusted to the profound and obscure, it cannot be seen, thus it has no form.

The Minister’s Exegesis states: The formless image is the complete embodiment of the Dao, rooted in constant non-being—what form could it possess?

The Dao is hidden and nameless. Only the Dao is good at bestowing and completing.

The Imperial Commentary states: From "the luminous Dao" to "the great image," all speak of the Dao. The marvel of the Dao cannot be sought through intellect nor grasped through form—it may be said to be utterly concealed. Though illuminated, it cannot be obtained. The sage, having attained the Dao, bestows without depletion, responds without exhaustion, and completes the myriad things without ever claiming possession, simply acting and then withdrawing. The essence of the Dao is hidden in namelessness, yet its function excels at bestowing and completing. Thus, when set in motion and practiced, it creates without manifesting and ceases without transformation. Even its secondary effects suffice to establish the achievements of emperors and kings. The *Tradition* states: "Learning begins with being a scholar and ends with being a sage."

The Minister’s Exegesis states: The essence of the Dao returns to utmost non-being. The function of the Dao is concealed in the unfathomable. Illuminating it appears obscure; imaging it yields no form—such is its concealment. Thus it cannot be sought through knowledge nor grasped through form—who could name it?

The act of "bestowing" responds to others' lack, meaning to give and seek its return. The Dao responds without fixed direction, nourishing the myriad things, bringing each to its own completion without end. What beings receive ultimately returns to their root. In this, nothing is lost to the giver, nothing expended by the receiver—hence it is called "excelling at bestowing and completing."

**Chapter 42: The Dao Gives Birth**
The Dao gives birth to the One.
*Imperial Annotation* states: In the great beginning, there was Non-Being-without-non-being, Non-Being-with-name—the arising of the One.
*Minister’s Exegesis* states: The Dao is eternally without right; the One is born from it, the undifferentiated state of qi.

The One gives birth to the Two.
*Imperial Annotation* states: Heaven is one, Earth is two; water follows, then fire, essence is complete, and spirit follows.
*Minister’s Exegesis* states: The One qi divides, and the qi of yin and yang become distinct—thus Heaven and Earth are born.

The Two give birth to the Three.
*Imperial Annotation* states: One and speech make two; two and one make three.
*Minister’s Exegesis* states: Heaven and Earth take their places, and the harmonizing qi arises—thus the Three Powers are complete.

The Three give birth to the myriad things.
*Imperial Annotation* states: Heaven initiates the One in the north, Earth pairs the Two in the south, humanity completes the position of the Three. The Three Powers are complete, and the ten thousand forms divide.
Counting the number of things is called "the ten thousand." Beyond this, even the most skillful reckoning cannot calculate.
*Minister’s Exegesis* states: With yin and yang present, the harmonizing qi brings harmony, and things are born. Numbered as the ten thousand, how could they be counted?

The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, harmonized by the harmonizing qi.
*Imperial Annotation* states: Yin is still and at rest—all things bear it. Thus the noble person enters at sunset to rest. Yang is fluid and flourishing—all things embrace it. Thus the sage responds to dawn and governs.
There must be the mean between yin and yang—this is the harmonizing qi.
*Zhuangzi* states: Supreme yang blazes brightly; supreme yin is solemn and still. Solemn stillness emerges from Heaven; blazing brightness issues from Earth. The two intermingle and form harmony, and things are born.
*Minister’s Exegesis* states: All things receive form between Heaven and Earth, discarding qi to yin and yang to live—thus none fail to bear and embrace it. The harmony of the harmonizing qi is what engenders life.

What people despise are only "orphaned," "widowed," and "unworthy," yet kings and dukes take these as their titles.
*Imperial Annotation* states: Things do not rise without falling, affairs do not flourish without declining—this is the movement of yin and yang, the principle of things. Waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness proceed together without losing harmony—is this not the sage alone?
Thus, "orphaned," "widowed," and "unworthy"—what people despise—kings and dukes take as their titles. Having reached the extreme, they return; having become full, they diminish. This is how they remain above without peril.
*Minister’s Exegesis* states: Lords and kings occupy positions of noble eminence, yet "orphaned," "widowed," and "unworthy" are what people despise. Kings and dukes, though in exalted positions, adopt what people despise, knowing the principle of fullness and diminution and thus maintaining the mean without loss.
Yin at its extreme generates yang; yang at its extreme generates yin. Losing balance in partiality, one must return to the harmony of yin and yang—thus the principle of diminution and augmentation is made clear.
Therefore, some things are diminished yet augmented, augmented yet diminished.
*Imperial Annotation* states: When leaves fall, they fertilize the roots—this is diminution that augments. When the moon waxes to fullness, it must wane—this is augmentation that diminishes. Heaven and Earth wax and wane with the seasons—how much more so for humans?
Thus, what kings and dukes adopt is precisely the way to attain augmentation while occupying noble eminence.
*Minister’s Exegesis* states: Augmentation leads to diminution; diminution leads to augmentation. The waxing and waning of Heaven and Earth, the advance and retreat of yin and yang—this principle is never otherwise. Kings and dukes adopt what people despise, attaining the Way of diminution and augmentation, moving with the seasons. This is how they occupy high and noble positions without stumbling.

What others teach, I also take as my teaching. "The strong and overbearing do not meet their proper end"—I take this as the father of teachings.

**Imperial Commentary** states: To subdue the weak with strength, to overcome the soft with hardness—this is what others teach. What I teach differs from this. The strong and overbearing cling to the self and delight in contention; this is the way to death. The wise observe this and take it as a warning, thus making it the father of teachings.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Some things, when diminished, are augmented; when augmented, are diminished. Yin and yang advance and retreat—where there is advance, there is retreat; where there is retreat, there is advance. The transformations of things, the waxing and waning of yin and yang—such is their inherent principle. Where principle resides, there lies the teacher of right teaching. To subdue the weak with strength, to overcome the soft with hardness—this is what others teach. The strong and overbearing delight in contention, for they are strong in their attachment to the self. Believing others cannot surpass them, they rely on force and never reflect. Thus, they are ultimately overcome by the strong and do not meet a good end. Those who understand this principle take the waxing and waning, the augmentation and diminution of others as a mirror, making it the foundation of teaching—this is the way of the father.

**Forty-Third Chapter: The Softest Under Heaven**
The softest under heaven gallops through the hardest under heaven.

**Imperial Commentary** states: What is hard will break; what is sharp will be blunted. Only the sage can accumulate countless small victories to achieve great triumph.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: The rigid cannot harmonize with things and is easily broken, thus destroyed by hardness and blunted by sharpness. The supremely soft does not oppose things, thus it can enter them and act, making even the hardest serve its purpose, galloping without awareness.

*"Non-being enters where there is no gap."*

**Imperial Commentary** states: The *Zhuangzi*’s Outer Chapters discuss how the one-legged *kui*, the snake, the wind, and the eye each cherish one another, concluding with the eye cherishing the heart. For the feet’s movement has limits, the eye’s vision has bounds, but only spirit is without direction. The Inner Chapters discuss the master of nurturing life, and how much more so the butcher’s dissection of the ox. *Ding* (丁) is the yin of fire and the minister of spirit, thus his blade moves with effortless abundance. Yet to enter where there is no gap—who but one whose body is utterly without limits and whose movement leaves no trace could achieve this?

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: "Non-being" means both self and things are absent. When self and things are absent, body and spirit merge with the Dao, thus attaining marvelous freedom without direction, roaming without trace. From this, we know the benefit of non-action.

**Imperial Commentary** states: The soft overcoming the hard, the absence embracing presence—such is the marvelous function of the Dao, truly embodied here. Abandoning affairs, the body is not wearied; forgetting life, essence is not depleted—this is how it is beneficial.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: The Classic says: "The heavenly vessel cannot be acted upon; those who act upon it ruin it." The marvelous function of the Dao lies in the unfathomable—how could it involve deliberate action? Those who act wearily shape themselves with affairs, depleting essence and harming life—what benefit is there in this? The teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few under heaven attain these.

**Imperial Commentary** states: The teaching without words is established through spirit; the benefit of non-action does not deplete one’s true nature. The sage embraces simplicity with this, and all under heaven submit. Without acting, the myriad things are transformed—thus few attain this.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Embodying spirit, their teaching is wordless; exhausting the Dao, their benefit is non-action. That all under heaven submit and the myriad things are transformed—truly few attain this.

**Forty-Fourth Chapter: Fame and the Self**
Fame and the self—which is closer? The self and wealth—which is greater?

**Imperial Commentary** states: If one’s arms are heavier than all under heaven, then which is closer—fame or the self? Life is not merely as precious as a *Sui* pearl—then which is greater, the self or wealth? The highest aspiration lies within me; fame is not what I cherish. The greatest abundance lies within me; wealth is not what I value. Only those who do not discern the distinction between closeness and distance, between more and less, harm their lives and injure their natures, sacrificing themselves. Like Boyi, who died for fame beneath Mount Shouyang, or Robber Zhi, who died for profit on Eastern Ridge—are they not deluded? Understanding the essence of life and not pursuing what is unnecessary for it—this is how those who possess the Dao differ from the vulgar.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Those who lose the principle of life and nature, entangled in the realm of fame and profit, and do not return—do not know the distinction between closeness and distance, between more and less. The self is within me—it is the source of utmost nobility and wealth, self-sufficient and requiring nothing from without. Fame and wealth are external—mere transient lodgings of things. To lose what is within me and pursue what is external, harming life and injuring nature—how foolish! Moreover, the self is closer than fame; if the self can be forgotten, how can fame be clung to? The self is greater than wealth; if the self is not possessed, how can wealth be a burden? Thus, which is closer and which is greater—those who possess the Dao do not permit such questions.

Gain and loss—which is more harmful?

**Imperial Commentary** states: Knights sacrifice themselves for fame; the greedy sacrifice themselves for profit. What they gain is fame and wealth, but what they lose is the uncarved simplicity of namelessness and the priceless vessel of the body—what harm could be greater?

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: What is gained from things lies without; what is lost from the self lies within. Reflecting inwardly, one轻 external things and avoids the suffering of pursuit and loss. Insatiable greed leads to essence being depleted and life not preserved, the body wearied and the spirit not released—this harm is extreme.

Thus, excessive love must lead to great expenditure; excessive hoarding must lead to heavy loss.

**Imperial Commentary** states: Without longing for externals, one’s harmony is not spent. Without being burdened by things, one’s hold is not lost. The balance between taking and giving, the alternation between accumulation and dispersal—this outcome is certain, like a cycle. How can it last long?

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Taking and giving, accumulation and dispersal—this is the inevitable principle. Yet if one is attached to things, the heart is enslaved and the spirit is spent. If one hoards things, the spirit is wearied and life cannot be enriched.

To know contentment is to avoid disgrace.
**Imperial Commentary** states: Abiding within the measure of restraint, what disgrace could there be?
**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Content with what one attains of oneself, knowing what is inherently noble—what disgrace could there be?

To know when to stop is to avoid peril.
**Imperial Commentary** states: Roaming where the myriad things begin and end, thus free from the calamity of peril.
**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Knowing to stop within the bounds of one’s nature, making no demands beyond—thus free from worldly troubles.

This is how one may endure long.
**Imperial Commentary** states: Things have their gathering and dispersal, but nature knows no past or present. The people of the world exchange their nature for things, thus pursuing fame and chasing profit, only to suffer disgrace and endanger themselves. The sage fulfills their nature and is content. The world is vast indeed, yet they do not harm their life thereby—thus they may endure long and stand alongside heaven and earth.
**Minister’s Exegesis** states: To know contentment is to return the heart to emptiness; to know when to stop is to unite the spirit with stillness. Emptiness gathers the Dao; stillness restores the Dao—thus one may endure long.

*Explication of the Dao and Its Virtue by Emperor Huizong of Song, Scroll Six, Completed*
*Composed by Court Gentleman for Promotion, Minister Zhang An*

**The Virtue Classic, Chapter Forty-Five: "Great Perfection Seems Deficient"**

Great perfection seems deficient, yet its use is inexhaustible.

**Imperial Commentary** states: Within the realm, there are four great things, and the Dao occupies one of them. To embody the Dao in its entirety is thus called "great." Without completion or loss, this is called "great perfection." Not clinging to its completion, it therefore seems deficient. Knowing transformation and harmonizing with change, without clinging to the old, its use is thus inexhaustible. This is how Confucius, in gathering great perfection, became a sage for all times.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: "Great perfection" refers to the Dao. Who can perceive the Dao’s great perfection in its entirety? Thus it seems deficient. "Seems deficient" means its completion is not apparent. Though complete, its means of completion are unseen, so its use is inexhaustible.

Great fullness seems empty, yet its use is unending.

**Imperial Commentary** states: Filling all without bound, sufficing the ten thousand things—this is "great fullness." Responding to things with emptiness, using them with moderation, its application is thus inexhaustible, its use unending. A skilled merchant conceals his wealth as if empty, his demeanor as if dull.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: "Great fullness" refers to virtue. When virtue is greatly full, its use is humble, as if empty. Being empty, its use is unending. For one who possesses virtue and dwells in fullness will find it exhausted.

Great straightness seems bent.

**Imperial Commentary** states: Adapting to the changes of things, yielding in curves and straightness, without seeking to impose itself, it thus seems bent.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Bending to respond to change, flowing without abiding, not contending with things for straightness—yet things do not perceive its straightness, though it never loses it.

Great skill seems clumsy.

**Imperial Commentary** states: Bestowing forms upon things, whether round or square, curved or straight, its marvel is unseen, thus it seems clumsy.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Carving the myriad forms without deliberate action—acting without acting, yet skill is realized in things. This is great skill. Its means of accomplishment unseen, its marvel unperceived, it thus seems clumsy.

Great eloquence seems inarticulate.

**Imperial Commentary** states: Eloquence without words is called "great eloquence." Hui Shi’s many arguments were but petty eloquence.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Words clarify the Dao, yet it is better to not speak and let the Dao clarify itself.

Restlessness overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat. Clarity and stillness govern the world rightly.

**Imperial Commentary** states: Yang moves and is restless, thus it overcomes cold. Yin abides and is still, thus it overcomes heat. These two incline toward yin and yang without attaining the mean, now confounding things, now contending with movement—how can they rightly govern the world? Only without the restlessness that overcomes cold and the stillness that overcomes heat can one be unadulterated and clear, embracing the spirit in stillness, so the world will right itself.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Restlessness generates inner heat, and with inner heat, even cold can be overcome. Stillness brings clarity of heart, and with a clear heart, even heat can be overcome. Cold and heat are the qi of yin and yang, yet when the heart’s restlessness and stillness prevail, cold and heat become imperceptible—how then can one govern rightly? When qi returns to oneness, it is clear and unadulterated; when spirit embraces oneness, it is still and unconfused. Only clarity and stillness, attaining oneness, can rightly govern the world.

**Chapter Forty-Six: "When the World Follows the Dao"**

When the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize the fields.

**Imperial Commentary** states: Those who govern the world with the Dao allow the people to each delight in their work without contention, tending only to their fields.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: With the Dao, there are no desires; without desires, there is no contention. Thus warhorses are retired, the people attend to fundamentals and delight in their work, not shunning even the humblest labor.

When the world lacks the Dao, warhorses breed on the outskirts.

**Imperial Commentary** states: The strong oppress the weak, the many tyrannize the few—even borders cannot be rightly maintained.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: When warhorses breed on the outskirts, fields lie fallow and the five grains go to waste. The weak and few are oppressed by the strong and many, so borders cannot be rightly maintained. Thus the people lose their place—this is evident.

No sin is greater than indulging desire.

**Imperial Commentary** states: Not seeing what can be desired keeps the heart from disorder. When people have desires, they go so far as to harm their nature and life to contend for them—this is the origin of sin.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Without what can be desired, the heart forgets. With what can be desired, contention begins. Desiring what is permissible leads to strife when desires are unmet. Strife brings chaos—no sin is greater.

No disaster is greater than not knowing contentment.

**Imperial Commentary** states: Levelness is fortune; excess is disaster. Knowing contentment brings no disgrace—what disaster could there be?

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Not knowing contentment makes desires boundless, so disaster becomes inescapable.

No fault is greater than desiring to obtain.

**Imperial Commentary** states: Obtaining what one desires invites the censure of others.

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Obtaining what one desires leads each person to seek gain, incurring fault with the multitude.

Thus, knowing contentment’s contentment is ever content.

**Imperial Commentary** states: Seeing what can be desired, people do not know contentment; not knowing contentment, they desire to obtain; desiring to obtain, contention arises and disaster follows. When excess reaches its limit, warhorses breed on the outskirts. Yet knowing contentment, each rests in their allotted nature and life, without employing their cunning. Daily needs—food and drink—what contention or chaos could there be?

**Minister’s Exegesis** states: Boundless seeking cannot be satisfied even by heaven and earth. Knowing contentment within one’s nature and lot leaves nothing lacking, ever self-sufficient.

**Chapter Forty-Seven: "Without Leaving the Door"**

Without leaving the door, one knows the world. Without looking out the window, one sees the Dao of heaven.

**Imperial Commentary** states: Though the world is vast, the sage knows it through wisdom. Though the Dao of heaven is distant, the sage sees it through the heart. Wisdom encompasses the ten thousand things, nothing is too remote to perceive—thus there is no need to leave the door. The heart abides in spirit and illumination, nothing is too obscure to illumine—thus there is no need to look out the window. Zhuangzi said: "In the time it takes to lower and raise one’s head, one may caress the lands beyond the four seas." This is how the sage subtly moves and transforms alone.

**Minister Yi states:** To know by stepping out the door is merely to know what can be known. To see by peering through the window is merely to see what can be seen. The vastness of the world and the boundlessness of the Dao of heaven—how can one know through knowing or see through seeing? Stepping out the door, one departs from this and gains some knowledge, yet how much can that knowledge encompass? Peering through the window, one turns toward that and gains some sight, yet how far can that sight reach? The sage subtly moves and transforms alone, not knowing through knowing—thus there is nothing unknown. Not seeing through seeing—thus there is nothing unseen. The world is where the myriad things reside, made so by their nature. The Dao of heaven is where the Dao abides, made so by its spontaneity. Its coarse aspect lies in things, its wondrous aspect lies in the Dao. Both are never apart from their immediate reality, yet exhaust all that can be known and seen—what need is there to step out, what reliance on peering?

The farther one goes, the less one knows. **The Imperial Commentary asks:** Does this not return to the heart of heaven and earth? When one draws near and takes from one’s own body, the ten thousand things are all complete. Seek it in yin and yang, seek it in measures and numbers, yet the farther one strays from the Dao, the less one knows.

**Minister Yi states:** To step out is to depart from stillness and move toward activity, growing ever more distant—thus one cannot return to the origin. The farther one goes, the less one knows; this is the principle. Therefore, the sage knows without moving, names without seeing, and accomplishes without acting.

**The Imperial Commentary states:** To know the world through one’s own wisdom is called knowing without moving. To see the Dao of heaven through one’s own heart is called naming without seeing. Knowing without moving, naming without seeing—what is there to do? Yet their success is towering; this is called accomplishing without acting.

**Minister Yi states:** Never departing from the immediate reality, one exhausts all that can be known and seen—what need is there to step out the door or peer through the window? Stepping out entails movement; peering entails seeing. The sage does not move but relies on wisdom, does not see but relies on the heart. Thus, the affairs of the world can all be known, and the wonders of the Dao of heaven can all be named. Able to know and able to name, one thus acts without acting, accomplishing what is self-accomplished.

**Chapter Forty-Eight: "Increasing by Learning"**

In learning, one daily increases.

**The Imperial Commentary states:** Learning is for attaining the Dao. One begins as a scholar and ends as a sage. Daily, one adds to oneself, and the Dao accumulates within until the body is sated. Confucius said of Yan Yuan, "I see his progress."

**Minister Yi states:** Learning is for seeking extensive knowledge; extensive knowledge is for exhausting principle. Thus, progress and increase are essential.

In cultivating the Dao, one daily diminishes.

**The Imperial Commentary states:** Those who attain the Dao cast off their limbs and body, dismiss their hearing and vision, depart from form and abandon wisdom, until all affairs dissolve into oblivion—thus it is called daily diminishing. This is how Shan Bao-yu, at sixty, underwent sixty transformations.

**Minister Yi states:** Cultivating the Dao is for attaining emptiness; attaining emptiness is for fully realizing one’s nature. Thus, daily diminishing is essential.

Diminish and further diminish, until one reaches non-action. Through non-action, there is nothing that is not done.

**The Imperial Commentary states:** Learning exhausts principle to encompass being; the Dao fully realizes nature to reach non-being. Diminish and further diminish, until there is not yet anything. That which is not yet anything and has no non-being—this is non-action. Serene and unmoving, yet nothing is left undone. Moved, one penetrates the causes of all under heaven. Through stillness, one becomes a sage; through movement, one becomes a king.

**Minister Yi states:** Fully realizing one’s nature is to reach utmost emptiness, where self and things are forgotten. Forgetting what is to be forgotten, one’s destiny returns to the Great Beginning. Thus, through non-action, one returns to the essence of the Dao; through nothing left undone, one exhausts the function of the Dao. Therefore, in stillness, one is a sage; in movement, one is a king.

To take the world, one always does so through non-affair. When there is affair, it is insufficient to take the world.

**The Imperial Commentary states:** The world is a great thing. Those who possess this great thing cannot be ensnared by things, yet can master things. Thus, those who take the world always do so through non-affair. The world is a divine vessel, not to be acted upon. Those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it. Thus, when there is affair, it is insufficient to take the world. The sage embodies the Dao and governs the self with its truth. When emperors rise and kings emerge, they respond by chance, and the world submits of its own accord. This is how King Tai of the Zhou left Bin and established his state beneath Mount Qi.

**Minister Yi states:** The world is where the wonders of the Dao reside, where divine transformations occur—thus it is called a great thing, a divine vessel. Only those with the Dao are where the world returns, yet they never treat affairs as affairs. Without affair, they act, yet return to non-action—thus the world is governed by me. When there is affair, one seeks to take the world by force, yet ultimately meets with ruin.

**Chapter Forty-Nine: "The Sage Has No Constant Heart"**

The sage has no constant heart; the hearts of the common people become his heart.

**The Imperial Commentary states:** The sage’s heart is the mirror of the ten thousand things. Empty, it can receive; still, it can respond. Like a mirror reflecting forms, it reveals their beauty or ugliness. Like an echo answering a sound, it matches its greatness or smallness. What constancy could there be? Observing the myriad things, he knows their feelings and follows the people—this is called making the hearts of the common people his heart. *Zhuangzi* said: "The lowly, yet one cannot but follow—they are the people."

**Minister Yi states:** The sage takes non-heart as his heart, thus he adapts to the times and responds to change—how could there be constancy? The hearts of the common people vary with the times. The sage follows them, making their time his heart. Thus, like a mirror reflecting forms, he neither advances nor retreats, revealing their beauty or ugliness. Like an echo answering a sound, he neither amplifies nor suppresses, matching their greatness or smallness—what need is there for constancy?

Those who are good, I treat as good; those who are not good, I also treat as good—thus virtue is goodness. Those who are trustworthy, I trust; those who are not trustworthy, I also trust—thus virtue is trustworthiness.

The *Imperial Commentary* states: Good and bad oppose each other, truth and deceit deceive one another—such are the sentiments of the vulgar world, where people create distinctions of sameness and difference. How can this be virtue? When virtue is goodness, one sees all actions as nothing but good, thus even the not-good are treated as good. When virtue is trustworthiness, one sees all dispositions as nothing but trustworthy, thus even the untrustworthy are trusted. Forgetting both truth and falsehood, unifying right and wrong—this is called the person of complete virtue. This is how Shun, in his dealings with Xiang, was sincere and joyful toward him.

**Minister Yi states:** The sage, in relation to others, is without ungoodness and without untrustworthiness. Thus, people follow goodness and follow trustworthiness, daring not to transgress. For good and evil, trust and deceit all arise from deluded emotions and false views, privately creating distinctions of sameness and difference. When right and wrong are blended into one, there is no good and no not-good. When trust and deceit are mystically united, there is no trust and no untrustworthiness. Treating the not-good as good and the untrustworthy as trustworthy, one discards no one. Thus, the not-good will themselves become good, and the untrustworthy will themselves become trustworthy—hence it is called "virtue as goodness" and "virtue as trustworthiness."

The sage’s presence in the world is marked by trepidation, blending his heart with the world. The *Imperial Commentary* says: While he is in the world, fortune and misfortune are shared with the people. Though he has no constant heart, he cannot but be vigilant. Thus, in what he does for himself, he is ever cautious and never at ease. In what he does for the world, he equalizes good and bad, unites trust and deceit, forgets both, and closes off what he might praise—merely blending all into one.

**Minister Yi states:** "Trepidation" describes a state of fear and caution. Though the sage has no constant heart, with the Dao in the world, when he responds to the age, he is never without trepidation as a warning. For he acts with purpose, not daring to take it lightly—thus sharing the people’s concerns. In acting for the world, his heart is blended into oneness, seeking to return to simplicity and restore inherent nature, uniting with the primordial beginning.

The people all fix their ears and eyes upon him; the sage treats them all as children. The *Imperial Commentary* says: Heaven sees through the eyes of the people, Heaven hears through the ears of the people. Thus, the sage takes the people’s hearts as his own. When the sage acts, the myriad things behold him, so the people all fix their ears and eyes upon him. If the people rely on the sage’s seeing and hearing, then the sage is the people’s parent. With compassion and care, he shelters them as if protecting an infant, and his benevolence covers the world.

**Minister Yi states:** The sage blends the world into oneness with the Dao, his heart without any differing heart. Thus, the people, in relation to their ruler, fix their ears and eyes to perceive and be transformed by the Dao. The sage regards them as children, for their hearts are unified, free from the affairs of cunning and artifice—thus returning to simplicity.

**Chapter Fifty: Emerging into Life, Submerging into Death**

Emerging into life, submerging into death. The *Imperial Commentary* says: All things emerge from the mechanism, all things submerge into the mechanism. The heavenly mechanism unfolds of itself, arising together with life. The heavenly mechanism ceases of itself, perishing together with death. Life is the beginning of creation’s workings; death is the transformation of yin and yang.

**Minister Yi states:** The life and death of the myriad things emerge and submerge within the transformative mechanism of yin and yang, unable to stop themselves. Emerging as yang, thus they live; submerging as yin, thus they die. What is born here dies there; what dies here is born there. Inherent nature has no life or death, yet it has existed since ancient times. The spirit emerges and submerges, while the form has life and death—hence it is called "emerging and submerging into life and death."

Those who follow life are thirteen; those who follow death are thirteen. The *Imperial Commentary* says: Those who accompany life and death, emerging and submerging within the mechanism of life and death, are not yet free from entanglement.

**Minister Yi states:** Emerging and submerging within the mechanism of life and death, they live together with life and die together with death, never parting from it—hence they are called "followers." The thirteen refer to the six that are carved into form and the seven that cling to the po. Emerging from form and life, sinking into dark yin, they all accompany it as followers.

The people’s lives, in their movements, reach the realm of death—also thirteen. The *Imperial Commentary* says: Clinging to life while turning from principle, forgetting life while pursuing profit—such are the lives of the common people. In their movements, they reach the realm of death. How do their lives differ from death?

**Minister Yi states:** Having form, they have life; having life, they pursue externals and turn from principle, losing their inherent nature to the point that all their movements reach the realm of death, unable to preserve life. It is also through the desires of the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, limbs, and the mind’s knowledge that they are lured into the realm of death without realizing it. Though they may briefly secure their lives, how is this different from death? Why is this so? Because of their excessive attachment to life.

The *Imperial Commentary* says: Those who follow life delight in life yet burden their forms; those who follow death hasten toward stillness and forget their bodies. Those who move toward the realm of death are like the linked cangues of prisoners stretching endlessly, like the executed corpses in view of one another—all unaware that the body is the great affliction, that life has its limits, and that their preservation of life is excessively thick. The ancients who attained the Dao did not use wealth and honor to nourish what harms the body, nor did they use poverty and low status to burden the form with profit. They did not rejoice in long life nor grieve over early death. With dawn-like clarity, they perceived the solitary, thus transcending past and present to enter the realm of neither death nor life.

**Minister Yi states:** Those who know life can be joyful and death can be grieved are mired in form, taking life and death as burdens. Those who know that life and death have never truly existed are immersed in unity, not taking life and death as burdens. Precisely because they take life and death as burdens, they delight in life and fear death. Because of this delight, they preserve life excessively, thereby harming life—never realizing that life has its limits.

It is said that those skilled in nurturing life, when traveling on land, do not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers; when entering battle, they are not struck by armor or weapons. The rhinoceros has nowhere to thrust its horn, the tiger has nowhere to place its claws, and weapons have nowhere to lodge their blades. Why is this so?

**For they abide in no realm of death.**

**The Imperial Commentary states:** Those skilled in nurturing life preserve their form in wholeness and restore their essence, uniting with Heaven as one. Their celestial guard remains intact, their spirit never retreats. They move unseen without obstruction, tread fire without scorching, walk above the myriad things yet feel no dread. Thus, though they encounter things, they are not daunted—nothing can harm them. *The Book of Changes* says: *"One who penetrates the Dao of day and night, who enters and exits the mechanism of life and death—nothing is not thus."* Yet those who comprehend the discourse on life and death, who transcend and penetrate the very source of things—are they not the perfected ones?

**Minister Yi states:** Where there is life, there is death. For qi gives rise to essence, essence gives rise to spirit, and spirit animates form. When spirit departs, form dissolves—this is the domain of life and death. But those skilled in nurturing life restore qi to its origin, preserve essence in unity, and refine spirit to the marvelous void, merging with the Dao in body. Thus, in their living, Heaven moves while they have never been born. In their departure, they feel no joy; in their death, things transform while they have never changed. In their return, they offer no refusal. Above, they wander with the Creator in the undivided wholeness of qi. They regard life as an excrescent growth, death as the bursting of a boil—then who would cling to form, who would cling to life? Only by forgetting life do they abide in no realm of death. Abiding in no realm of death, what do they fear of what others dread? Nothing can burden them, nothing can harm them.

**Chapter Fifty: "The Dao Gives Them Life"**—
*The Dao gives them life...*

The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: The Dao is ever non-active yet accomplishes all; the myriad things fulfill their offices, all growing from non-action.

Minister Yi says: The Dao returns to perfect nothingness, yet the host of beings depend on it to live.

It nurtures them with virtue—
The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: That by which things attain life is called virtue.
Minister Yi says: Things are born of the Dao, each receiving from the Dao, thus they are reared in virtue.

It shapes them—
The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: It retains movement to generate things; when things take form and embody principle, this is called shaping.
Minister Yi says: The myriad things assume myriad forms, each possessing its own attainment.

It completes them through configuration—
The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: Once form and substance are fully arrayed, their bodily configuration is thus achieved—the mutual measuring of long and short, the mutual inclination of high and low—such is the nature of their configuration.
Minister Yi says: They mutually engender and mutually perfect, mutually shape and mutually incline; thus their configuration is completed.

Therefore, the myriad things none fail to revere the Dao and honor virtue.
The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: That to which the myriad things all turn their heads is the Dao. That which completes and elevates them is virtue. Reverence enables them to overcome things, while what is honored by the humble cannot be despised by them. Mencius said: "The nobility of Zhao Meng can debase what he has ennobled"—for it is not virtue.
Minister Yi says: The Dao is the origin of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things, hence it is called revered. Reverence implies honor beyond measure, thus the Dao is spoken of as revered. Virtue follows the Dao, yet things cannot debase it, hence virtue is spoken of as honored.

The reverence of the Dao, the honor of virtue—none confer rank upon them, yet they are ever naturally so.
The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: Things may decay in time, configurations may incline in time, but the true sovereign transcends the world. True honor resides within, not borrowed from external configurations, ever abiding in self-possession.
Minister Yi says: The Dao governs the myriad things yet is not governed by them, hence it is revered. Virtue follows the Dao, and no thing can precede it, hence it is honored. The Dao does not revere itself—it is what the myriad things revere. Virtue does not honor itself—it is what the myriad things honor. Their reverence and honor are not sought yet ever naturally so.

Thus the Dao gives them life, rears them, nurtures them, matures them, ripens them, sustains them, and shelters them.
The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: Spoken separately, there are distinctions between Dao, virtue, configuration, and things; spoken together, all issue from the Dao. The Dao is the mystery of the myriad things: when things transform and arise, the Dao is born with them; when things withdraw and are stored, the Dao is completed with them. It issues from *Zhen*, is completed in *Gen*, is nurtured in *Kun*, and shelters in *Qian*. Hard and soft rub against each other, the eight trigrams surge together—like a mechanism that cannot cease, the Dao truly enfolds them.
Minister Yi says: That virtue rears, that things take shape, that configurations are completed—all issue from the Dao. The Dao enfolds the myriad things, serving as their mystery. Thus, in their issuing and entering, their living and completing, their transforming and sheltering—what lies beyond the Dao?

It gives life yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely, leads yet does not dominate—this is called profound virtue.
The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: In giving life, it manifests in movement and emergence; in acting, it effects through transformation; in leading, it appears in unity and governance. The Dao descends, yet what resides in virtue is this: giving life yet not possessing its achievement, acting yet not relying on its ability, leading yet not displaying its art of control—who but the subtlest of virtues could attain this? Hence it is called profound virtue.
Minister Yi says: There is that which is given life, that which is acted upon, that which is led—these are manifestations of virtue apart from the Dao. Only because it can give life yet does not possess its achievement, can act yet does not rely on its ability, can lead yet leaves no trace of its governance—hence it is the profundity of virtue.

**Chapter Fifty-Two: "The World Has a Beginning"**
The world has a beginning, which serves as the mother of the world.
The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things. Beginning and mother are both the Dao. From the inception of qi, it is called beginning; from its ceaseless generation, it is called mother. Having a beginning, it can generate without end.
Minister Yi says: The world has a beginning—this is simply the One of the Dao, not the beginning of Heaven and Earth. It is what is called the named mother of the myriad things. The One is the beginning of the named, hence it is the mother of the world. The inception of qi is the One. That from which things are self-generated has the Dao of the mother.

Having attained its mother, one knows her children.
The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: The Dao can mother the myriad things and nurture them, thus things are its children. Those who penetrate the Dao embrace things, and things thus attain their mother to know their children.
Minister Yi says: The arising of the One is how the Dao generates things. Having attained the mother, one knows the myriad things as her children.

Having known her children, one returns to guard their mother; thus one’s body does not perish.
The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: Hearing much, one guards it with simplicity; seeing much, one guards it with transcendence. Exhausting the principles of things yet not burdened by them, attaining the subtleties of the Dao yet not losing its wonder—then one’s utility enters and exits without exhaustion, coming and going without end. One can preserve life, fulfill one’s years, and suffer no peril of decay.
Minister Yi says: Zhuangzi said: "Form does not arise without the Dao," thus the myriad things originate in the Dao, born of the One. Knowing that the myriad things are all mothered by the One, one cannot but guard the One. Guarding the One, though the body may be cast aside, the spirit does not perish.

Block its openings, close its gates—thus one labors not to life’s end.
The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: *Dui* speaks of delight; *men* speaks of exit. Things entice from without, and the heart delights within. Ears, eyes, nose, and mouth—from these the spirit and brightness issue forth. Be cautious within, close off without; do not take communion with things as joy. If things cannot draw one in, then one delights in Heaven and attains self-possession—who would toil toilsomely for things?
Minister Yi says: *Dui* is delight in externals, so the heart has somewhere to go.

When the gates are opened, the spirit turns toward movement. When its *dui* is blocked, the heart attains unity. When its gates are closed, the spirit attains stillness. With the heart unified and the spirit stilled, this is how one guards the Mother. Guarding the Mother, one returns to the Dao and finds self-possession in all directions—what toil could there be?

Opening its *dui* and aiding its affairs, one remains beyond salvation to life’s end.
The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: Deluded by pleasing appearances, one engages with them in contention, pursuing tasks and clashing with things, toiling endlessly without ever seeing success.
Minister Yi says: When the heart delights in things, it chases illusions and pursues ends, going forth without return, exhausting its spirit in use, laboring to the point of depletion in affairs to seek their completion—what folly could be greater? In this way, one loses essence and forfeits numinosity—how could it be saved?

To see the small is called illumination.
The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: The small is the subtlety of the Dao. One who perceives the subtlety of the Dao knows oneself and thus lacks nothing in clarity.
Minister Yi says: Though "small" and "uncarved" are alike in smallness, to see it is called illumination, for it is self-knowledge.

To guard the soft is called strength.
The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: The soft is the root of the Dao. One who guards the root of the Dao overcomes oneself and thus overcomes all.
Minister Yi says: Knowing to guard the soft, one knows how to overcome oneself.

Use its light, return to its brightness.
The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: Brightness is the essence of light; light is the function of brightness. The sage’s response to the world arises from essence and manifests as function, scattering radiance as light. Drawing function back to essence, wisdom becomes penetrating clarity. Displaying it in transformation, concealing it in function—like the sun and moon illuminating all things without ever diminishing—this is how one spiritually embodies virtue.
Minister Yi says: Light is brightness manifest externally. The sage reveals the Seven to engage the world—this is the function of light. Concealing function to return to the Dao is the return of brightness.

To leave no calamity upon the self is called following constancy.
The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: The transformations of things are without constancy. Only one who returns to life leaves things and departs from people, returning to brightness without being transformed along with things. Thus one embodies constancy and knows no harm, unlike those who, like fireflies, glow briefly with form.
Minister Yi says: To use one’s light without returning is to regard oneself as substantial while opposing the endlessness of things. When the use of light is exhausted, things become calamities for the self—this is to bring calamity upon oneself. Only by returning to brightness and reverting to the uncarved does one embody constancy without being transformed by things—this is called following constancy. The wondrousness of true constancy can be obscurely unified but cannot be overtly grasped, hence it is called "following."

**Chapter Fifty-Three**
Were I to possess even slight knowledge, I would walk the great Dao and fear only deviation.
The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: The Dao rejects extravagance and excess. Extravagance is indulgence in virtue; excess is profligacy in nature—both are deviations of application. One who is slight yet discerning of things, knowing inwardly, deepens roots and strengthens foundations, drawing sufficiency from the self—thus fearing only deviation.
Minister Yi says: One who is wholehearted may attain the Dao. To forget the heart is to be without fear. Possessing even slight knowledge and walking the great Dao is to have the heart set upon the Dao—thus one cannot be without fear of action.

The great Dao is utterly level, yet the people prefer byways.
The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: The Dao is level, while byways are swift. Seeking speed to hasten near-term results, one strays ever farther from the Dao.
Minister Yi says: The Dao is easy to know and easy to practice, without difficulty—like a great road, utterly level. Yet the people prefer byways, employing cleverness and seeking shortcuts to pursue quick gains, thus losing the Dao.

The court is excessively adorned, the fields lie fallow, the granaries are empty.
The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: Exalting the worthy and employing the capable to bring order to the court, yet failing to devote effort to agriculture and accumulate resources to foster a prosperous populace—this is to pursue ends while abandoning roots, an unsustainable path.
Minister Yi says: When the court is excessively adorned, external embellishment is pursued; when fields lie fallow and granaries are empty, the root is neglected. To adorn the external while abandoning the root is no enduring way.

Adorned in brocade, girded with sharp swords, sated with food and drink, possessing surplus wealth—this is called thievish ostentation, not the Dao!
The *Yuzhu* Annotation states: Those who act within the contract of life move without seeking fame; those who act beyond it are intent on lavish expenditure. Moving without seeking fame, one fears only deviation. Intent on lavish expenditure, one adorns in brocade, girds with sharp swords, sates with food and drink, and takes surplus wealth as glory rather than shame—clinging to excess, destroying righteousness, arrogant and extravagant, how could this be the Dao?
Minister Yi says: Abandoning roots to chase ends, pursuing externals to harm the internal, forgetting one’s inherent nature while possessing what is not one’s own, forgetting one’s innate worth while boasting of what is not inherently noble—this is called thievish ostentation.

**Attributed to Gentleman of Court Rank, Serving Official Zhang An**

*Explication of the* Virtue-Power Classic, *Chapter Fifty-Four: "What is Well-Established Cannot Be Uprooted"*

What is well-established cannot be uprooted.
*Imperial Annotation* states: Established in the center, it encompasses above and below—thus it cannot be uprooted.
*Minister’s Explication* says: When the heart is bound, it leans and loses the center. Centered, it is free from bias or attachment—this is what is well-established, and thus cannot be uprooted.

What is well-embraced cannot be lost.
*Imperial Annotation* states: Embracing the One to respond to all changes—thus it cannot be lost.
*Minister’s Explication* says: To embrace well is to embrace the One. Pure and undivided, singular and unwavering, it can respond to endless transformations without ever being lost.

Descendants will continue their sacrifices without cease.
*Imperial Annotation* states: Established in the center without straying from the Dao, embracing the One without departing from essence—such a one does not merely act for a single state or a single generation. Rather, their influence extends to all under heaven and to future ages; their transmission endures far.
*Minister’s Explication* says: Established in the center and embracing the One, their influence is boundless, their Dao overspreads all under heaven. Posterity will enjoy unceasing blessings, and thus descendants will continue their sacrifices without cease.

Cultivate it in the self, and one’s virtue becomes true.
Cultivate it in the family, and one’s virtue becomes abundant.
Cultivate it in the village, and one’s virtue becomes enduring.
Cultivate it in the state, and one’s virtue becomes bountiful.
Cultivate it in all under heaven, and one’s virtue becomes universal.
*Imperial Annotation* states: Cultivate it in the self, and one’s virtue becomes true—this is what is meant by the true essence of the Dao for governing the self. Cultivate it in the family, and one’s virtue becomes abundant; cultivate it in the village, and one’s virtue becomes enduring—this is what is meant by its residual threads for governing others. Cultivate it in the state, and one’s virtue becomes bountiful; cultivate it in all under heaven, and one’s virtue becomes universal—this is what is meant by its unadorned substance for governing the state and all under heaven. The farther one’s cultivation extends, the broader one’s virtue becomes. What is within me is all its truth; what lies beyond is but its outward manifestation. Thus, abundance precedes endurance, bounty precedes universality—these are external to the Dao.
*Minister’s Explication* says: Established in the center, there is no excess or deficiency; embracing the One, essence remains whole and undivided. Cultivating this in the self, virtue becomes true. Cultivating this in the family, virtue becomes abundant. Cultivating this in the state, virtue becomes bountiful. Cultivating this in all under heaven, virtue becomes universal. The farther one’s cultivation extends, the broader one’s virtue becomes. The true essence of the Dao resides within me; thus, cultivating the true in the self, the self is perfected. Only then does one extend this virtue—from the family to the village, to the state, to all under heaven—and virtue grows ever broader.

Therefore, observe the self through the self, observe the family through the family, observe the village through the village, observe the state through the state, observe all under heaven through all under heaven.
*Imperial Annotation* states: All things are complete within me. Turning inward to sincerity, there is no greater joy. Thus, observe the self through the self, and the self is governed—extend this principle. All under heaven has its constancy; observe it through this, and all under heaven is governed.
*Minister’s Explication* says: The principles of all under heaven are constant, each with its own perfection. Those who fully realize them cannot harbor private cleverness. Thus, one who observes the self does not look beyond the self; one who observes the family does not look beyond the family. The same applies to observing the village, the state, and all under heaven. Those who deviate from this are not true observers.

How do I know that all under heaven is thus? By this.
*Imperial Annotation* states: Through simplicity, the principles of all under heaven are attained.
*Minister’s Explication* says: To know that all under heaven is thus and to exhaust its principles, one must return to the center and the One—this is simplicity. It is nothing more than following one’s nature and adhering to principle.

*Chapter Fifty-Five: "Those Who Contain Profound Virtue"*

Those who contain profound virtue are like newborn infants.
*Imperial Annotation* states: The people are born with inherent thickness, but they are swayed by external things. Those who contain profound virtue are not swayed by things—their qi is concentrated, their will singular. *Mencius* says: The great person does not lose their childlike heart.
*Minister’s Explication* says: Human virtue is originally whole and undivided, but it is swayed by external things, becoming shallow rather than profound. Only when both self and things are forgotten, and one contains profound virtue, is essence preserved whole and undiminished, spirit singular and undivided. Thus, one returns to a state of unknowing, and the heart becomes like that of a newborn.

Poisonous insects do not sting them, fierce beasts do not seize them, birds of prey do not strike them.
*Imperial Annotation* states: Those who contain profound virtue cannot be entered by anxiety or restlessness, nor can perverse qi invade. Thus, nothing can harm them. *Zhuangzi* says: If one can empty the self to wander through the world, who could harm them?
*Minister’s Explication* says: Like newborn infants, their essence is whole and spirit secure. The heart returns to a state of non-heart, and fear, anxiety, or restlessness cannot enter. Thus, they have never harbored a mind that startles things, and things do not harm them.

Their bones are weak and their sinews soft, yet their grip is firm. They do not know the union of male and female, yet their organ stirs—such is the perfection of essence.
*Imperial Annotation* states: When virtue is whole, the form is whole—thus, bones are weak and sinews soft, yet their grip is firm. When the form is whole, the spirit is whole—thus, they do not know the union of male and female, yet their organ stirs. The perfection of essence can enter the spirit. *Zhuangzi* says: The sage values essence.
*Minister’s Explication* says: When virtue is whole, qi is whole; when qi is whole, spirit is whole; when spirit is whole, form is whole. When spirit is whole, form is not bound by existence, and qi transforms it. Thus, bones are weak and sinews soft, yet their grip is firm. Qi is not stirred by movement, and essence remains whole in the One—thus, they do not know the union of male and female, yet their organ stirs.

They cry all day without their throat becoming hoarse—such is the perfection of harmony.
*Imperial Annotation* states: Attaining the One is called essence; when essence is perfected, virtue is whole and spirit is not diminished. The harmonious qi is the mean—when harmony is perfected, qi is whole and the throat does not become hoarse. In human life, essence is received from the One of Heaven as the source of wisdom, and harmony is received from the Five of Heaven as the root of trust. At their utmost, they can enter the spirit and return to the mandate. But if one loses the childlike heart, essence wavers and does not endure, qi becomes violent and does not nourish. The form and nature are scattered, and one is submerged in the myriad things—is this not lamentable?

Minister Yi states: The infant’s form engages with things, yet its heart remains ever still and unified. The sounds it emits and the movements of its qi arise spontaneously—not because the heart commands the qi, nor does it bear the burden of moving qi. Thus, it preserves the wholeness of essence, completes the harmony of qi, its spirit remains unharmed, and its voice does not grow hoarse. Such is the subtlety that allows entry into the spirit, the constancy that enables the return to the mandate—this is the perfection of harmony.

"To know harmony is called constancy."
*Imperial Annotation* states: Guarding the purity of qi, life’s command is held within; the form transforms, yet nature does not perish.
Minister Yi states: Constancy is the ultimate reality, ever thus and never altering. Though the form may undergo myriad changes, nature remains unshaken. Preserving the purity of qi and safeguarding supreme harmony, one knows harmony and permits no deviation—hence it is called constancy.

"To know constancy is called clarity."
*Imperial Annotation* states: Clarity sufficient to perceive the Dao lies in knowing that nature does not perish.
Minister Yi states: Knowing that nature possesses constancy and never alters, never perishes, one’s vision of the Dao becomes clear—hence it is called clarity.

"To augment life is called omen."
*Imperial Annotation* states: An omen is the precursor of things. The principle of life, when augmented, becomes superfluous—fortune and misfortune remain undetermined.
Minister Yi states: The principle of life is already complete; why seek augmentation? Augmentation becomes an omen, for fortune and misfortune are not yet fixed.

"When the heart commands the qi, it grows strong daily."
*Imperial Annotation* states: When the body aligns with the heart, and the heart aligns with qi, qi remains harmonious and not violent. Stumbling or rushing—these are movements of qi, yet the heart truly commands them, thus becoming strong. This is to contend with things, not the way of self-mastery.
Minister Yi states: When the heart returns to nothingness, qi is preserved in harmony. When the heart commands qi, qi becomes violent and loses its nourishment. Things grow strong, then age—this is called not following the Dao.

*Imperial Annotation* states: The Dao knows no past or present; things have their prime and their decline. Strength may turn to weakness, flourishing to decay. Governed by time and bound by fate—how can this be the Dao?
Minister Yi states: With strength comes age, shifting with time and transformation. The form changes accordingly—such is the nature of things. Those who embody profound virtue, like the infant, possess constancy and do not change—this approaches the Dao.

"Not following the Dao brings early demise."
*Imperial Annotation* states: The Dao has no beginning or end, yet the people’s delusion has persisted for ages.
Minister Yi states: Without the Dao, though life may be strong, it has already lost the principle of life.

**Chapter Fifty-Six: The Wise Do Not Speak**
The wise do not speak; those who speak do not know.
*Imperial Annotation* states: The Dao cannot be questioned, and questions receive no answer. Those who know the Dao recognize it in silence, without need for words. When Nie Que questioned Wang Ni four times, he received four responses of ignorance. Excessive speech leads to exhaustion, and one drifts far from the Dao.
Minister Yi states: The Dao cannot be spoken, thus those who embody it do not speak but recognize it in silence. What can be spoken is but the coarse aspect of the Dao. Excessive speech leads to exhaustion, so those who speak do not know.

"Block the apertures, close the gates."
*Imperial Annotation* states: Seal the senses and guard the spirit, withdrawing and concealing in secrecy.
Minister Yi states: Blocking the apertures ensures the heart takes no delight in externals; closing the gates ensures the spirit does not stray toward things—this is how one withdraws and conceals in secrecy.

"Blunt the sharpness, untangle the knots."
*Imperial Annotation* states: Take depth as the root, simplicity as the guiding principle.
Minister Yi states: Blunting the sharpness makes it dull before it becomes truly effective. Untangling the knots means not being ensnared by things. When the root is deep, sharpness is not apparent; when the principle is simple, what need is there to untangle knots?

"Harmonize the light, merge with the dust."
*Imperial Annotation* states: Flow with things, moving in unison with their waves.
Minister Yi states: Harmonizing the light is returning to one’s inherent brightness. Merging with the dust is blending indistinguishably with things. By returning brightness and blending with things, one moves in unison with their waves.

This is called "mysterious sameness."
*Imperial Annotation* states: The Dao returns to the utmost subtlety, uniting with the utmost oneness. The utmost subtlety is called "mysterious," the utmost oneness is called "sameness." In mysterious sameness, the myriad things and I become indistinguishable—how could one then be entangled in the petty distinctions of closeness and distance, benefit and harm, nobility and baseness?
Minister Yi states: The utmost subtlety encompasses all wonders; the utmost oneness admits no duality. Being and non-being, self and other—all merge in mysterious sameness. One cannot be drawn near or kept distant, cannot be benefited or harmed, cannot be made noble or base. Thus, one is honored by all under heaven.

*Imperial Annotation* states: The people of the world attack one another with love and hate, displaying intimacy and estrangement. Their emotions and deceits interact, giving rise to views of benefit and harm. Their choices and rejections vie for dominance, creating distinctions of nobility and baseness. These shift and alternate endlessly—how could such things be honored by all under heaven? Those who know the Dao forget words, and in forgetting words, they dissolve preferences and aversions, transcend emotions and deceits, abandon choices and rejections, and merge in mysterious sameness within the unity of nature. True honor is self-sufficient; when the heart of all under heaven is forgotten, one becomes honored by all under heaven.
Minister Yi states: Those who are objectified by things can be drawn near or kept distant, benefited or harmed, made noble or base. But when self and other merge in mysterious sameness, one objectifies without being objectified by things—thus, none can confer rank upon them, yet they remain ever in accord with nature.

**Chapter Fifty-Seven: Governing with Rectitude**
Govern the state with rectitude, deploy troops with奇 (unconventional tactics), and win the world through non-action.
*Imperial Annotation* states: Rectitude is the constancy of the Dao;奇 (unconventionality) is its adaptability; non-action is its true essence. The state is stabilized through rectitude, victory in war is achieved through奇, and the true essence of the Dao admits no selfishness. Following the natural course of things, the world is governed.
Minister Yi states: Governing the state with rectitude to establish order is the constancy of the Dao. Deploying troops with奇 to achieve victory is its adaptability. Winning the world through non-action is its true essence. When lords and kings attain the One as rectitude, nothing fails to align—thus the state is well-governed.

War achieves victory through adaptability as its unconventionality, and nothing can overcome it—such is the function of military force. When laws are enacted, deceit arises; when commands are issued, fraud emerges. Thus, the ruler who practices non-action holds the left tally, and the world responds—this is what is meant by "winning the world through non-action."

How do I know this is so? The more taboos there are in the world, the poorer the people become.

*Imperial Annotation* states: The people are not difficult to gather—cherish them, and they draw near; benefit them, and they come. But impose what they detest, and they scatter. Now, without cherishing or benefiting them, and with many taboos and prohibitions, the people will scatter to the four directions, hence their increasing poverty.

Minister Yi states: Many taboos lead to many affairs and many prohibitions, so the people are harassed by laws and cannot secure their livelihoods. Thus, the people first fall into disorder and then into deeper poverty.

When people possess many sharp instruments, the state grows ever more benighted.

*Imperial Annotation* states: Where there are mechanical devices, there must be mechanical affairs; where there are mechanical affairs, there must be mechanical minds. Once mechanical minds arise, purity and simplicity are lost, and some may deceive their superiors by means contrary to the Dao.

Minister Yi states: When people vie with one another through mechanical devices, deceit and falsehood sprout. They alternately form cliques to deceive and obscure, which is why the state grows ever more benighted.

When people value cunning and skill, strange things proliferate.

*Imperial Annotation* states: When craftiness and skill prevail, people pursue frivolous ends, and bizarre attire and strange implements emerge to corrupt customs.

Minister Yi states: When cunning and skill are esteemed, customs are corrupted by the strange and unusual.

When laws and decrees grow ever more elaborate, thieves and bandits multiply.

*Imperial Annotation* states: Excessive scrutiny inevitably elicits unworthy responses.

Minister Yi states: When the state is benighted by people vying with sharp instruments, and customs are corrupted by the esteem for cunning and skill, with many taboos and prohibitions leaving the people impoverished and unemployed, then governance loses its rectitude, and the world is harassed by excessive affairs. As laws and decrees grow ever more elaborate and controls ever more stringent, the people become increasingly shameless. When the people are without shame, there is nothing they will not do—hence the proliferation of thieves and bandits.

Therefore, the sage declares: "I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves."

*Imperial Annotation* states: Heaven is non-active and thus clear; Earth is non-active and thus tranquil. When the two non-actions combine, the myriad things are transformed. The sage is but Heaven and Earth, so the people daily move toward goodness without knowing who effects it.

Minister Yi states: The sage embodies the Dao through non-action, restoring nature to its original nature. Thus, the people are transformed from above without knowing how they are transformed.

"I value stillness, and the people rectify themselves."

*Imperial Annotation* states: When a mirror reflects a form, it does not employ cleverness, yet the square, round, curved, and straight cannot escape it. How could it require compasses and squares to be correct?

Minister Yi states: Stillness unifies governance, and the people are all unified in rectitude.

"I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves."

*Imperial Annotation* states: The world is originally without affairs—mediocre people disturb it. Do not disturb it, and the people will enrich themselves.

Minister Yi states: When the ruler engages in no affairs, the people have surplus energy, live in peace, delight in their work, and become prosperous.

"I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity."

*Imperial Annotation* states: Do not esteem the worthy, and the people will not contend. Do not prize rare goods, and the people will not steal. Align with desirelessness, and the people’s nature is preserved.

Minister Yi states: Without desire, there is no intent. When the ruler has no intent, the people recover their nature, find sufficiency in their allotted nature, return their minds to unity, and preserve their simplicity.

**Its Governance Unadorned**

The *Imperial Annotation* states: In governing the world through non-interference, the people below merely know of the ruler’s existence, yet feel no exuberant joy.

Minister Yi states: When the ruler governs the world through the Dao’s non-interference, the people below follow the Dao to fulfill their lives. Above and below align in unity, returning to the Dao. The ruler does not display action, and the people do not perceive the emperor’s power—thus is the obscurity of governance.

Its people are pure and simple.
The *Imperial Annotation* states: They embrace plainness and hold to simplicity, with few selfish desires and scant cravings.

Minister Yi states: "Pure and simple" means being naturally unadorned, free from selfish desires, and returning to one’s original livelihood.

Its governance is meticulous and exacting.
The *Imperial Annotation* states: Combing one’s hair with fine teeth, counting grains while cooking, and priding oneself on petty precision—this is the governance of meticulous exactitude.

Minister Yi states: Such governance, with its ostentatious clarity, pursues the minutest details. New policies are enacted, and severity is mistaken for wisdom.

Its people are deficient and flawed.
The *Imperial Annotation* states: When the worthy are promoted, the people contend; when cunning is employed, the people steal. Thus, their virtue is never whole.

Minister Yi states: When governance is exacting, the people grow crafty in deception. Harmed by their own artifice, they cannot preserve wholeness—hence, their virtue is never complete.

Misfortune leans upon fortune, and fortune hides within misfortune. Who knows their ultimate end?
The *Imperial Annotation* states: Clarity arises from obscurity, order emerges from formlessness. Virtue, wisdom, and sagacity are preserved through affliction. In the households of the lofty and wise, ghosts peer into their chambers. Knowing the times, one does not linger; knowing one’s allotment, one does not cling to constancy. Recognizing that beginnings and ends cannot be fixed, how can misfortune and fortune, with their mutual concealment, have any permanence?

Minister Yi states: Prosperity and adversity, fortune and misfortune, success and failure—these alternate and intertwine like a ceaseless cycle, without end. Only by resting in one’s allotted time and portion can one accept the natural arising of misfortune and fortune, for how can they be constant?

Is there no true standard?
The *Imperial Annotation* states: If you make those who agree with you the standard, how can you correct them once they already agree? If you make those who differ from you the standard, how can you correct them once they already differ? Then who is the ultimate standard for the world?

Minister Yi states: To know goodness as goodness is already not goodness. To know beauty as beauty is already ugliness. When one merges with the supreme Dao without knowing how, who can claim a standard? Moreover, with misfortune and fortune boundless, who can impose one?

The standard reverts to the strange; goodness reverts to the ominous. The people’s delusion has endured for so long.
The *Imperial Annotation* states: The world is but a single qi. Today’s "right" was yesterday’s "wrong"; what was first resisted is later embraced. The divine and the foul, the putrid and the fragrant—all alternate in cycles. Thus, the strange and the standard, the ominous and the good, transform of themselves within the qi. The world has existed for so long, yet minor delusions distort direction, and great delusions distort nature. Has the prevalence of self-serving customs not obscured this truth? If misfortune and fortune’s mutual concealment are further scrutinized with exacting governance, how can the people return to their true nature?

Minister Yi states: Standards and strangeness, goodness and ominousness—all judgments of right and wrong arise from delusion and are not the great constancy. The people’s loss of their original nature has endured for so long. Unable to return to the root and align with the Dao, they merely seek fortune in their flawed state. If governance remains exacting, imposing a partial standard as the sole truth, can the world truly be made uniform under it?

Thus, the sage is square but does not cut,
The *Imperial Annotation* states: "Square" distinguishes things, yet the great square has no corners. It remains still without flowing, leaving no trace of distinction.

Minister Yi states: "Square" implies distinction, yet being square without cutting means merging with the undivided Dao, not severing from things.

Sharp but does not pierce,
The *Imperial Annotation* states: "Sharp" prides itself on purity, yet great purity is not fastidious. It is clear yet accommodates all, without harshness or severity.

Minister Yi states: Standing immaculate above the myriad things, yet embracing all without displaying harshness.

Straight but not unrestrained,
Radiant but not dazzling.
The *Imperial Annotation* states: Straight yet unrestrained breeds arrogance toward others; radiant yet dazzling invites the exhaustion of ostentation. Inwardly straight but outwardly yielding, using one’s light yet returning to one’s clarity—only the sage achieves this! The people’s delusion lies in taking squareness as rightness, like Zimo’s clinging to the mean; in taking sharpness as rightness, like Zhongzi’s austerity. Knowing expansion but not contraction, knowing brilliance but not subtlety, they flaunt themselves in the corrupt customs of the age, losing the sage’s wholeness. How can this rectify the world?

What, then, does the sage use to rectify the world? Only this.

Minister Yi states: "Utmost straightness appears curved," for it follows the meandering of things yet does not lose the straightness of the Dao. Straight yet unrestrained, one possesses straightness yet overbears what is not straight. Harmonizing one’s light and returning to one’s clarity, one blends with the dust of things yet never differs from them—how could one then display light to dazzle externally? Straight yet not unrestrained, radiant yet not dazzling—this is how the sage rectifies the world.

**Chapter 59: Governing People and Serving Heaven**
In governing people and serving heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.
The *Imperial Annotation* states: Hearing and seeing, wisdom and discernment belong to heaven. Movement and stillness, thought and deliberation belong to man. Adapting to the rhythm of movement and stillness, reducing the burden of thought and deliberation—this is how one governs people. Not exhausting the power of hearing and seeing, not depleting the task of wisdom and discernment—this is how one serves heaven. This is called frugality. The primordial unity resides in the storehouse, attending to the kidneys, standing in the garden of inexhaustible bounty. When the wellspring of wisdom overflows and its resonance emerges, human affairs are ordered and heavenly principle is attained.

Minister Yi states: The toil of movement and stillness wears the body; the labor of thought and deliberation taxes the mind—this is how man fails to govern himself. Exhausting hearing and seeing, depleting wisdom and discernment—this is how heaven cannot be served. When both are unified in frugality, the spirit is not expended, and the spirit is preserved in essence and oneness. In governing people and serving heaven, nothing is more essential than this. Thus, the sage does not err in movement and stillness, is not burdened by thought and deliberation, gathers hearing and seeing, forgets wisdom and discernment, and becomes one with heaven. This is called frugality. Then the storehouse is deep, yet its presence is not displayed; it is firm yet not expended.

Only through frugality does one return early.
The *Imperial Annotation* states: Those who return after losing their way do so late. Those who return before straying do not transgress their nature—thus they return early.

Minister Yi states: When resonance preserves the spirit without expenditure, return comes early.

Early return is called accumulating virtue abundantly.
The *Imperial Annotation* states: Return is the root of virtue. Returning through self-awareness, the Dao within me daily accumulates and renews.

Minister Yi states: Returning through self-awareness, virtue accumulates within. Returning early, what is gained grows ever more abundant.

Abundantly accumulating virtue, there is nothing one cannot overcome.
The *Imperial Annotation* states: To overcome is to be victorious. Governing the myriad things, commanding the host of movements, and overcoming all—only virtue achieves this.

Minister Yi states: When virtue is abundantly accumulated, it grows ever more profound. With profound virtue, the Dao suffices to overcome one’s selfishness, reaching the point of forgetting the self. Forgetting the self, one forgets things. When self and things are forgotten, there is nothing one cannot overcome.

Nothing one cannot overcome—then none know its limit.
The *Imperial Annotation* states: When virtue reaches the point of overcoming all, it responds boundlessly without exhaustion—who knows its limit?

Minister Yi states: When virtue reaches the point of overcoming all, it is because self and things are forgotten. When self and things are forgotten and one returns to utmost nothingness, how can its limit be known?

None knowing its limit, one can possess the state.
The *Imperial Annotation* states: Embracing the boundless, one’s use of the world is inexhaustible—how much more so for possessing a state?

Minister Yi states: Only after embodying the Dao and preserving the spirit can one possess a state. In governing people and serving heaven, this is the utmost perfection.

Possessing the mother of the state, one can endure long.
The *Imperial Annotation* states: The Dao is the mother of the myriad things. Those who possess the Dao endure for ten thousand generations without decay.

Minister Yi states: The mother of the state is the limitless Dao. Only the Dao is constant and unchanging—thus it endures long.

This is called delving into the root and firming the foundation, the Dao of long life and enduring vision.
The *Imperial Annotation* states: The Dao is the mother of things, and things are its children. Nature is the root of form, and form is its foundation. Knowing the child, one guards the mother—thus one does not perish even in death. This is how one endures long. Roots deep, foundations firm; nature restored, form preserved—one becomes constant with heaven and earth, thus attaining long life. One shares radiance with the sun and moon, thus attaining enduring vision. While people and things transform, I alone endure—this is called the Dao.

Minister Yi states: When nature returns to the Dao, its roots run deep. When form is born of the Dao, its foundation is firm. If roots are not deep, essence is not whole; if essence is not whole, spirit is not secure; if spirit is not secure, form departs. Thus, deep roots and firm foundations enable long life, enduring vision, and steadfast existence.

**Chapter 60: Governing a Great State**
Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.

The Imperial Commentary states: Managing great affairs with frequent disturbances yields little success. Storing great vessels and frequently moving them leads to much damage. Cooking small fish with constant stirring causes them to disintegrate. Governing a great state with frequent changes to the law causes confusion. Thus, the Way of governance values clarity and stillness, and the people naturally settle.

Minister Yi states: When cooking fish, allow them to mature on their own, without employing cunning or skill. The sage practices non-action, entrusting the myriad things to their natural course—thus it is like cooking small fish. Those who govern the world with the Dao render even ghosts powerless.

The Imperial Commentary states: The sage, master of spirits, people, and the myriad things, must reluctantly oversee the world—nothing is better than non-action. The Dao is ever without action; in governing the world thus, there is nothing that is not well-ordered. Those who rely on others to act will all find peace and rest, none emerging to cause harm. Thus it is said, "their ghosts are not potent."

Minister Yi states: If one does not govern the world with the Dao, people are overcome by private and perverse influences, causing yin and yang to fall into disorder and ghostly spirits to seize opportunities, thereby manifesting their malevolence. When the ruler governs with the Dao, heaven is clear, earth is tranquil, people are harmonious, and qi is balanced—even ghosts find peace, for rectitude prevails. Thus, ghosts are not potent. It is not that ghosts lack potency, but that their potency does not harm the people. It is not that their potency does not harm the people, but that the sage also does not harm the people. When the two do not harm one another, virtue and power converge.

The Imperial Commentary states: Those who govern the world with the Dao act without contrivance, ever in accord with nature. Without the calamities of war or the punishments of execution, this is called "not harming the people." At such a time, spirits and people do not harm one another, and virtue and power converge. Spirits have no occasion to display their numinous responses, content merely with abundant blessings. Thus it is said, "their potency does not harm the people," and the people have no need to employ their cunning or skill. Daily sustenance and food—what harm could there be?

Minister Yi states: When one acts with deliberate effort and busies oneself with affairs, the world abounds with taboos. Laws and decrees proliferate, punishments grow severe, taxes become onerous, enemies are provoked, fields lie fallow, and the people grow ever poorer. The hundred clans suffer hardship, unable to secure their lives—this is self-inflicted harm upon the people. When the ruler governs the world with the Dao and does not harm the people, following the principles of the myriad things’ nature and lives, without disrupting the harmony of yin and yang, then all good things flourish in great accord, each finding its proper place, and qi resonates with the harmony of heaven and earth. How could spirits harm people? They are content merely with abundant blessings. At this point, people and spirits converge in mutual return, virtue and power do not harm one another—this is the perfection of governance.

*End of Volume Eight of the Imperial Annotated and Interpreted "Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue" by Emperor Huizong of Song*
*Beginning of Volume Nine of the Imperial Annotated and Interpreted "Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue" by Emperor Huizong of Song*

**Commentary by Gentleman of Court Rank, Attendant Gentleman Zhang An**

**Chapter 61: "The Great State Is the Lower Reaches"**

The great state is the lower reaches.

*Imperial Annotation states:* No one lacks the heart that hastens toward commerce, yet those who hasten toward the heights often stumble. The reason the rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys is that they excel in lowering themselves.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Flowing downward, they become the destination of all streams, thus achieving their greatness. In the intercourse of the world, the world’s female—femininity ever prevails through stillness, while masculinity is made low through stillness.

*Imperial Annotation states:* The world all contends with things through hardness and strength, yet I alone dwell in the realm of softness, stillness, and non-contention. Who then could overcome me? This is the Way by which one engages with the world.

The *Classic* says: Know its masculinity, yet guard its femininity, and become the world’s stream.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* If one establishes oneself through hardness and strength, things become one’s adversaries. Softness does not contend; stillness does not initiate. Only through softness and stillness can one be without conflict with things—this is how one becomes the world’s female, the Way by which one engages with the world. Thus, when a great state lowers itself before a small state, it wins over the small state. When a small state lowers itself before a great state, it wins over the great state. Therefore, some lower themselves to take, while others are lowered to be taken.

*Imperial Annotation states:* To gather, one must first expand; to take, one must first give.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Only by lowering oneself can one take. Those who do not lower themselves will inevitably be lowered by others and remain beneath them. A great state desires nothing more than to nurture and shelter others; a small state desires nothing more than to serve and attend others. When both attain what they desire, the greater should therefore be the one to lower itself.

*Imperial Annotation states:* The Way of Heaven descends and illuminates, thus nothing is not covered. The Way of Earth is lowly yet ascends, thus it can bear Heaven. Humans emulate Earth, Earth emulates Heaven—therefore, the greater should be the one to lower itself.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* If a small state does not lower itself before a great state, calamity swiftly follows. When a great state lowers itself before a small state, the small state rarely fails to submit. Those who cannot lower themselves remain beneath the great state—thus, the greater should be the one to lower itself.

**Chapter 62: "The Dao Is the Mystery of the Myriad Things"**

The Dao is the mystery of the myriad things.

*Imperial Annotation states:* The northwest is the mystery of Heaven, where essence transforms in seclusion. The Yellow Springs are the mystery of Earth, where spirits and flourishing lie hidden. The mystery of humans lies in thought, which harbors the most profound spirit. Heaven, Earth, and humans each have what is called mystery, yet all are enveloped by the Dao. The Dao is difficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom, difficult to measure, difficult to know—thus it is the mystery of the myriad things. If the Dao is the mystery of the myriad things, then are things the manifestation of the Dao?

*Minister’s Exegesis:* The Dao is that from which the myriad things emerge, yet it cannot be seen—thus it is called the mystery of the myriad things. All things are enveloped by the Dao; the Dao shelters and covers all without exception, its wondrous workings deep and hidden—this is the meaning of "mystery." It is the treasure of the good person.

*Imperial Annotation states:* Acting with benefit and accumulating goodness refines one’s nature, so that spirit and clarity are naturally attained, and the sagely mind follows.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* The good person knows to value and cherish the Dao, thus does not lose themselves in things and knows what is truly precious. It is the refuge of the unvirtuous.

*Imperial Annotation states:* Turning away from it brings only harm; following its principle preserves wholeness. Movement without deviation from the norm, stillness that rectifies one’s nature—thus it can preserve the self.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* "Preserve" is like the preservation of a tutor, as in "preserving an infant." Though a person may be unvirtuous, when their nature is still and their principle is aligned, they attain wholeness and rectitude—this is what the Dao preserves. How could it be abandoned? Since the Dao does not abandon them, it is called "preservation."

Fine words can be traded in the marketplace; esteemed conduct can be imposed upon others. The unvirtuous—how could they be abandoned?

*Imperial Annotation states:* Words are like wind and waves; conduct is like gain and loss. Neither is what the Dao values. Yet if words are fine and pleasing, if conduct is esteemed and exalted, they can still be traded and imposed upon others, and people will submit. How much more so the mystery of the Dao, which universally covers and embraces all without distinction? Then how could the unvirtuous be abandoned?

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Fine words and esteemed conduct are ever more distant from the Dao, yet they can still be traded if they benefit others. How much more the mystery of the Dao, which covers all without exception? Thus, though a person may be unvirtuous, the Dao preserves them and does not abandon them.

Thus, in establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Dukes, though one may offer large jade discs preceded by teams of four horses, it is not as good as sitting and advancing this Dao.

*Imperial Annotation states:* The noble person’s duty is to cultivate the self so that the world is at peace. The Son of Heaven and the Three Dukes may possess jade and horses to summon the worthy, yet if they do not devote themselves to advancing the Dao to cultivate the self, they will abandon themselves to follow others, losing the Way of self-governance. It is not as good as sitting and advancing this Dao—seeking it within oneself alone. Where the Dao resides, the sage esteems it, and the people follow as if returning to the marketplace.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* The Son of Heaven and the Three Dukes govern the world through the Dao. Jade discs and teams of four horses are the most precious of things, yet if one’s heart is set on things, one loses the Dao and follows things, unable to govern. Sitting and advancing this Dao transforms the world, and those who return do so as if to a marketplace—this too is seeking it within oneself alone.

Why was this Dao esteemed by the ancients? Did they not say: Seek and you shall obtain; with transgressions, you shall be spared? Thus it is esteemed by the world.

*Imperial Annotation states:* To seek is to obtain—seeking lies within oneself. The reason the ancients sought it in the calculations of yin and yang yet did not obtain it was because their seeking lay outside. The wicked turn toward goodness; the foolish become wise—is this not how transgressions are spared? The Dao’s ability to save is like this—thus it is esteemed by the world.

The *Tradition* says: There is nothing in the world that does not esteem the Dao.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Only the Dao can save people without abandoning them, save things without abandoning them. Thus, seek and you shall obtain; with transgressions, you shall be spared—this is why it is esteemed by the world.

Seek what lies within oneself, thus seeking yields attainment. Restore one’s nature to its origin, thus transgressions are spared.

*Chapter 63: Acting Without Acting*
Act without acting, attend without attending, savor without savoring.

*Imperial Annotation states:* The essence of the Dao is non-action, hence “without acting.” It is without form, hence “without attending.” It is without desire, hence “without savoring.” The sage responds to the existence of things while embodying the non-existence of the Dao—through these three, its outline may be glimpsed.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* The Dao is without acting, for it allows things to achieve completion on their own. The Dao is without attending, for it allows things to unfold on their own. Without acting, there is no contrivance; without attending, there is no form. Without contrivance and without form, one abides in flavorless simplicity—what desire could there be? Those who pursue externals, indulging in worldly flavors and cravings, ensnared by the mouth’s burdens—how could they grasp the essentials of embodying the Dao?

*Great and small, many and few.*
*Imperial Annotation states:* “Great and small” refer to form; “many and few” refer to quantity. The measure of things is boundless and cannot be demarcated. If the great are not many and the small are not few, who can discern the distinction between the repayment of enmity and gratitude? This is how the sage unifies the ten thousand things in the One of non-existence, thereby accomplishing greatness.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Though “great and small, many and few” pertain to form and quantity and thus differ, when gratitude and enmity are regarded with equal vision, who can find fault? Repay enmity with virtue.

*Imperial Annotation states:* Rank and emolument are insufficient to encourage; execution and disgrace are insufficient to shame—what enmity could there be? What is esteemed is virtue alone.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* When one is entangled in existence and the breath of the body, one is startled by favor and disgrace, hence there is gratitude and enmity. When one abides in the realm of self-attainment, who distinguishes between self and other? Thus, there is no gratitude or enmity. What is esteemed is virtue—nothing appears worthy of enmity, hence it is said: repay enmity with virtue.

Plan for difficulty while it is easy; accomplish the great while it is small. The difficult affairs of the world must arise from the easy. The great affairs of the world must arise from the small.

*Imperial Annotation states:* A thousand-zhang dike collapses from the hole of an ant; a hundred-chi chamber burns from the smoke of a chimney crack. When the Lord of Bai Gui patrolled the dike, he plugged the holes—thus there was no flood disaster. When the old man was cautious with fire, he sealed the cracks—thus there was no fire calamity. The affairs of the world often begin in the most minute, and by their end, they cannot be mastered. Therefore, the sage acts early.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Affairs lie hidden in what is overlooked; difficulty lies in planning at the outset. If one knows to plan for what is easy and small, there will be no failure in the end. Once a matter stumbles at the first step, nothing can be done. Thus, the sage never acts as if great, and so is able to accomplish greatness.

*Imperial Annotation states:* Acting when it is small, one is able to accomplish greatness. If one waits to govern until after disorder has formed, is it not too late?

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Accumulate the small to become lofty and great.

One who makes light promises is surely lacking in trust; one who treats much as easy is surely beset by difficulty. Thus, the sage treats things as difficult, and so ultimately encounters no difficulty.

*Imperial Annotation states:* Disasters often lie hidden in the minute and arise from what is overlooked. The sage’s response to the world is always cautious of the minute and never negligent. Thus, there is initially no light or easy conduct, and ultimately no calamities of difficulty to be planned against—all because one embodies non-existence.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Light promises are a trivial matter, yet they lead to the calamity of lost trust. Treating much as easy is to overlook the minute, yet it leads to the burden of many difficulties. The sage treats things as if they were difficult—thus, the affairs of the world ultimately present no difficulty. This is because one fears the minute.

*Chapter 64: What Is Secure Is Easily Upheld*
What is secure is easily upheld; what has not yet shown signs is easily planned for. What is fragile is easily dissolved; what is minute is easily scattered. Act before things arise; govern before disorder begins.

*Imperial Annotation states:* Security is the opposite of danger; what has not yet shown signs is the opposite of what has taken form. Fragility is the opposite of firmness; the minute is the opposite of the manifest. Uphold what is secure, and there will be no danger. Plan for what has not yet shown signs, and it will not take form. The sage’s knowledge of the incipient: dissolve what is fragile, and it will not become solid ice; scatter what is minute, and it will not become manifest. This is the perilous nearness of the worthy.

A speeding chariot, a sunken boat—the sage has no use for wisdom. Why employ wisdom for what has not yet sped or sunk? This is what is meant by “act before things arise; govern before disorder begins.”

*Minister’s Exegesis:* “What is secure” and “what has not yet shown signs” refer to affairs that have not yet taken form. “What is fragile” and “what is minute” refer to affairs that are extremely small. Acting before affairs take form is to act before things arise. Governing what is extremely small is to govern before disorder begins.

A tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a tiny sprout. A nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth. A journey of a thousand *li* begins beneath one’s feet.

*Imperial Annotation states:* Among things with form, the great must grow from the small, the high must be founded on the low, the distant must begin from the near. Their beginning is simple, but their completion is surely vast. The sage sees the beginning and thinks of the end, observes the finger and knows the destination. Thus, one does not precede fortune nor initiate calamity, hesitates to undertake affairs, and always succeeds.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* The tree is a metaphor for growth from small to great; the terrace is a metaphor for ascent from low to high; the journey is a metaphor for progression from near to far. The great, the high, the distant—all begin from the minute. This is how the sage undertakes affairs and achieves success.

One who acts fails; one who grasps loses. Thus, the sage does not act, and so does not fail; does not grasp, and so does not lose.

*Imperial Annotation states:* The sage does not engage in busyness, hence there is no failure. One does not cling to the past, hence there is no loss. The deluded measure and rigidly adhere—how can they avoid failure and loss when they depart further from the Dao?

*Minister’s Exegesis:* To act once and seek completion is to invite failure. To grasp and demand a peck is to invite loss. Only by non-action can one allow things to achieve completion on their own and avoid failure. Only by non-grasping can one attain what is naturally attained and avoid loss.

Thus, when the people engage in affairs, they commonly fail at the point of near-completion.

*Imperial Annotation states:* To halt midway, to abandon halfway, to begin with vigor yet end in slackness—such is the nature of the common people, and none are exempt. Hence, affairs often reach near-completion only to end in failure.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Only the sage possesses both beginning and end. When the common people depart from the Dao to undertake affairs, how can those affairs endure? Thus, they invariably fail. If one remains as vigilant at the end as at the beginning, no affair will fail.

*Imperial Annotation states:* All things have a beginning, but few attain their end. When beginning and end are as one, renewal occurs day by day. Applied to affairs, what could not be accomplished?

*Minister’s Exegesis:* To maintain unity from beginning to end is the height of vigilance; thus, affairs will not fail. Therefore, the sage desires what others do not desire and does not prize rare and precious goods. They study what others do not study, thereby restoring what the multitude has lost.

*Imperial Annotation states:* Those who desire profit exchange themselves for things; those who pursue learning drown their minds in breadth. How can this lead to non-action? The sage does not allow profit to burden the body; their desire lies in non-desire. Nourishment of self and others is fulfilled and then ceases. Thus, they do not prize rare goods, nor do they allow human artifice to obliterate Heaven. Their learning lies in non-learning, in gathering brilliance within illumination alone. Thus, they restore what the multitude has lost. The Dao is not made manifest. Even the worthy transgress it—how much more the common people? Restoring their transgressions and returning them to their nature is why those who abandon learning have no sorrow and find joy.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* The allotment of nature is originally sufficient, hence there is no desire. The principle of nature is originally luminous, hence there is no need for learning. Only by forgetting what is inherently sufficient does one multiply desires and lose oneself. Only by obscuring what is inherently luminous does one drown the mind in excessive learning. The sage does not allow profit to burden the body, and their desire lies in non-desire; thus, they do not prize rare goods. They do not allow human artifice to obliterate Heaven, and their learning lies in non-learning; thus, they restore what the multitude has lost. To call it a transgression is to lose the mean. Correcting this transgression is how one restores nature. This is how one assists the spontaneity of the myriad things without daring to act.

*Imperial Annotation states:* Heaven is high, earth is low, and the myriad things are utterly distinct—who compels them? It is simply the spontaneity of their nature. Assisting their spontaneity allows them to fulfill their nature. To act is to fail; thus, one does not dare to act. This is why the sage relies on the transformative power of the Dao and does not employ cunning or skill.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* The nature of the myriad things is each endowed with spontaneity. The sage embodies the Dao through non-action and merely assists them. What lives fulfills its life; what reaches completion fulfills its completion. Human effort plays no part. To act is to fail; thus, one does not dare to act.

**Chapter Sixty-Five: Those of Old Skilled in the Dao**

Those of old skilled in the Dao did not enlighten the people but sought to make them simple.

*Imperial Annotation states:* The people may be made to follow, but they cannot be made to understand. Those of old skilled in the Dao merely made them follow. Reversing their usual state, the Dao can be carried and journeyed with, without employing cunning or skill—hence, it is called simplicity. Since the Three Dynasties, they have abandoned tranquil non-action and delighted in the earnest and sincere, bending and shaping ritual and music to rectify the forms of the world, and sighing over benevolence and righteousness to console the hearts of the world. They sought to enlighten the people, calling it governance—yet what greater disorder could there be?

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Since the Three Dynasties, teachings have grown increasingly detailed, their refinement ever more elaborate, yet by the end of the Zhou, great corruption arose—this was the fault of enlightening the people. Thus, the Old Master sought to make them simple. He caused them not to know what goodness is as goodness, what beauty is as beauty, and to have no aspirations, each content in their allotted nature, not harming their Heaven-given truth, complete in self-attainment, and not employing artifice. Thus, they could return to constancy and restore simplicity.

The people are difficult to govern because of their excessive knowledge.

*Imperial Annotation states:* The world is repeatedly thrown into great disorder, and the fault lies in the love of knowledge.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* When people compete with knowledge, falsehood and deceit grow daily—how can this lead to good governance? Thus, governing the state with knowledge is the state’s bane.

*Imperial Annotation states:* Laws are issued, and treachery arises; commands are given, and deceit follows.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* When knowledge is esteemed, people compete with cunning and deceit, making governance difficult. Thus, knowledge is the state’s bane. Not governing the state with knowledge is the state’s blessing.

*Imperial Annotation states:* Burn the tallies, break the seals, and the people return to rustic simplicity. Smash the measuring cups, break the scales, and the people cease to contend.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Not employing knowledge leads the people to simplicity and non-contention—this is the state’s blessing, a qi greater than all else.

Knowing these two paths is also a model.

*Imperial Annotation states:* Knowing these two paths is to know how to govern the state. Knowing how to govern the state, the people will emulate and pattern themselves after it as a model.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* When superiors know that governance lies in both employing and not employing knowledge, the people will follow their example and have a model to emulate.

To constantly know the model is called profound virtue.

Profound virtue is deep and far-reaching, turning back from things.

*Imperial Annotation states:* Profundity is the color of Heaven. To constantly know the model and not employ one’s knowledge is to unite one’s virtue with Heaven—deep beyond measure, far beyond reach, standing alone above the myriad things. No thing can pair with it; thus, it is said to turn back from things.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Knowing the model and not employing knowledge returns the mind to non-mind and knowledge to non-knowledge—this is the profundity of virtue. Profound virtue is most deep and most far-reaching, thus it turns back from things and merges with the Dao.

Only then does one attain great compliance.

*Imperial Annotation states:* Compliance is the principle of Heaven. To attain great compliance is to abandon knowledge and habit, following the principle of Heaven alone. Zhuangzi said: "To unite with Heaven and Earth is to merge seamlessly, as if foolish, as if dull." This is called profound virtue uniting with great compliance. Only by being as if foolish, as if dull, can one abandon knowledge.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* In the age of profound virtue, each thing follows its own nature without knowing why—this is called great compliance.

**Chapter 66: The River and Sea as Kings of the Hundred Valleys**
The river and sea can be kings of the hundred valleys because they excel at being lowly; thus they become kings of the hundred valleys.

*Imperial Annotation:* In initiating affairs and establishing enterprises, the one who rises above all is called king. "King" implies a place to which all return. If a ruler can humble himself before those below, the people will return to him as water flows downward.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* The river and sea excel at being lowly, so all streams return to them—thus they are great.

Therefore, if the sage wishes to be above the people, he must place his words below them. If he wishes to lead the people, he must place himself behind them. Thus, though the sage dwells above, the people do not feel oppressed; though he dwells ahead, the people do not feel harmed. Therefore, the world delights in exalting him and never tires of it.

*Imperial Annotation:* The *Book of Changes* says of the initial hexagram *Tun*: "The noble lowers himself before the lowly—this is how he greatly wins the people." To win the people is to win their hearts. If he dwells above yet the people do not feel oppressed, following him becomes effortless. If he dwells ahead yet the people do not feel harmed, those who benefit from him are many. In such a case, none will fail to submit, and thus they will never tire of him. The *Book of Changes* says: "The hundred clans support the capable."

*Minister’s Exegesis:* The sage humbles his words, and the people exalt him—thus, though he dwells above, the people do not feel oppressed. He places himself behind, and the people push him forward—thus, though he dwells ahead, the people do not feel harmed. The people’s hearts delight in exalting and returning to him, so they never tire of him. Because he does not contend, no one in the world can contend with him.

*Imperial Annotation:* To practice worthiness while abandoning the conduct of self-aggrandizement—where could one go and not be loved?

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Without contention, the mind is empty; thus the world responds with emptiness—what contention could there be?

**Chapter 67: The World Calls My Dao Great**
The world says my Dao is great, yet it seems to resemble nothing. Precisely because it is great, it seems to resemble nothing. If it resembled anything, it would long since have been small.

*Imperial Annotation:* To resemble things is small; to be resembled by things is great. The Dao covers and sustains the ten thousand things—vast and boundless, it is great indeed, and thus seems to resemble nothing. If it resembled anything, the Dao would have something outside itself—how could it then be great?

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Once it enters into forms and vessels, it cannot avoid resemblance. But the Dao has nothing outside itself—what could it resemble? Nothing is greater than the Dao—how could it be small?

I possess three treasures, which I treasure and hold fast.

*Imperial Annotation:* Unlike the views of the vulgar world, these are what I treasure and never lose.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* What can be held fast and never lost is like a treasure—it is not the view of the vulgar world.

The first is called *ci* (compassion).

*Imperial Annotation:* *Ci* is to love things—it is the essence of benevolence.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* *Ci* is to love things, thus not harming life or injuring things, allowing the ten thousand things to follow their nature.

The second is called *jian* (frugality).

*Imperial Annotation:* *Jian* is to suffice with what one has—it is the essence of propriety.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* *Jian* is to suffice with what one has, not losing one’s nature to external things. Thus it does not waste resources or harm the people, and the people naturally follow the highest principle.

The third is called *not daring to be first in the world*.

*Imperial Annotation:* To be first is to seek to surpass others, valuing force over virtue.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* To respond without initiating, to place oneself behind and below, to value humility and not seek to surpass—this is how one becomes a vessel of leadership.

Thus, *ci* enables courage.

*Imperial Annotation:* King Wen regarded the people as if they were wounded; with one outburst of anger, he pacified the people of the world.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Because of *ci*, the people love their ruler as they love their parents and elder brothers, as hands and feet protect the head and eyes. Who in the world could oppose him?

*Jian* enables expansiveness.

*Imperial Annotation:* To store up in winter is to flourish in spring. Even Heaven and Earth cannot constantly indulge in excess or waste—how much less can humans?

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Only through *jian* can one avoid excess and waste, be self-sufficient and never lacking, not harm the root with the branch, or lose the internal for the external—thus one can be expansive.

Not daring to be first in the world enables one to become a vessel of leadership.

*Imperial Annotation:* To not contend yet excel at victory is the Dao of Heaven. The Dao is revered, thus it becomes the leader of vessels.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Heaven, Earth, humans, and spirits all value humility. To place oneself below and not contend—this is how one becomes a vessel of leadership.

Now, if one abandons *ci* yet seeks courage, abandons *jian* yet seeks expansiveness, abandons being last yet seeks to be first—this is death.

*Imperial Annotation:* The world knows that courage can overcome others but does not know that *ci* enables courage. It knows that expansiveness can impress the masses but does not know that *jian* enables expansiveness. It knows that leadership is esteemed but does not know that placing oneself behind is essential. Such are the ways of the rigid and strong—they lead only to death.

*Ci* in battle brings victory; in defense, it brings solidity.

*Imperial Annotation:* The benevolent are invincible in the world. Thus, in battle they are victorious. The people love their ruler as hands and feet protect the head and eyes, as children and younger brothers defend their parents and elder brothers, willing to die without fleeing—thus, in defense they are solid.

Heaven will save them, protecting them with *ci*.

*Imperial Annotation:* Those whose hearts are set on benevolence are inwardly guided by Heaven; those whose hearts are set on malevolence are deprived of Heaven’s mirror. Thus, what Heaven uses to save and protect them is *ci* alone—this is why *ci* is the first of the three treasures.

**Chapter 68: The Good Warrior**
The good warrior is not martial.

*Imperial Annotation:* Martiality is a lesser Dao; the warrior values aspiration, saying only "benevolence and righteousness." Confucius said: "I have never studied the affairs of armies and war."

The good fighter is not angry.

*Imperial Annotation:* The highest warfare is to defeat the enemy’s strategy; anger truly overcomes thought.

The good conqueror of enemies does not contend.

*Imperial Annotation:* Contention is contrary to virtue. To contend over land in battle, killing enough to fill the fields; to contend over cities in battle, killing enough to fill the walls—victory or defeat is still undetermined.

The absence of martiality is how martiality is perfected; the absence of anger is how anger is mastered; the absence of contention is how contention is resolved. These three all emerge from virtue—thus they are called "good."

The good at employing others places themselves below.

*Imperial Annotation:* Though wisdom may surpass all under Heaven, the wise do not scheme for themselves—thus the wise devise strategies for others. Though ability may exhaust all within the seas, the able do not act for themselves—thus the able serve others. Though eloquence may adorn the myriad things, the eloquent do not speak for themselves—thus the eloquent are employed by others.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* To be good at placing oneself below is to have others work for me, and all under Heaven assist me. This is called the virtue of non-contention.

*Imperial Annotation:* Virtue transcends reputation; wisdom arises from contention. Those whose talents are complete and virtue unmanifest have never been heard to initiate—they only ever harmonize with others.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Not being martial, not being angry, not contending, and placing oneself below—these are virtues, not mere tactics.

This is called employing the strength of others.

*Imperial Annotation:* The keen of sight and hearing exhaust their perception; the wise and capable expend their strategies and abilities—yet those who position them remain without knowledge.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Gathering keen perception and forgetting wisdom and ability—this is how the keen perception, wisdom, and ability of all under Heaven are fully realized.

This is called matching Heaven, the ultimate of antiquity.

*Imperial Annotation:* To act through non-action is called Heaven. To employ others without contention is thus to match Heaven. To match Heaven is to reach the utmost—nothing can be added to it. Hence it is called the ultimate of antiquity. *Ultimate* means "utmost." The utmost of wood is the ridgepole of a house.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* The Way of Heaven suppresses the high and elevates the low. To be able yet place oneself below and not contend is called matching Heaven. To match Heaven is to unite with Heaven—this is the utmost of the Dao. Hence it is called the ultimate of antiquity.

Thus when armies clash in battle, the compassionate prevail.

*Imperial Annotation:* The sage’s use of arms rescues the people from water and fire, taking only what is broken. Divine martiality does not kill, but treasures *ci*—thus the seven realms of Heaven submit in reverence, and the four corners of the earth stand in awe. This is called constant victory.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* To exalt killing and conquest is the affair of warfare. To grieve and rescue is the Way of warfare. The compassionate constantly prevail—this is the warrior’s use of arms by the humane. Thus one may win without fighting.

**Chapter Seventy: My Words Are Exceedingly Easy to Know**

My words are exceedingly easy to know, exceedingly easy to practice,
yet none under Heaven can know them, none can practice them.

*Imperial Annotation:* The Dao shines forth and is easily perceived—thus when expressed in words, it is exceedingly easy to know. It is essential and easily preserved—thus when manifested in action, it is exceedingly easy to practice.
Mencius said, “The Dao is like a great road—how could it be difficult to know?”
Thus the Dao presents no difficulty, and none under Heaven are incapable of it. Those who find it difficult or impossible have simply failed to turn inward and seek within themselves.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* The words of the sage merely clarify the Dao and analyze principle. Therefore, his teachings all arise from the inherent nature of life and destiny, removing obstructions to reveal what is already so. Turning inward, one attains it—it is not difficult to know or practice. Yet people abandon the near to pursue the distant, chase after branches while losing the root, seek externally, drown in excessive words, and sink in a flurry of affairs, never grasping the source. Thus none can know, none can practice.

“Words have their source; affairs have their lord.”

*Imperial Annotation:* Words are inexhaustible, yet principle is their foundation. Affairs are boundless, yet the Dao is their master. Following principle in inquiry and adhering to the Dao in action, nothing under Heaven is difficult.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Words derive their source from principle—grasp principle, and words are forgotten, for principle is their root. Affairs take their lord from the Dao—attain the Dao, and affairs dissolve, for affairs are but its branches. It is only due to ignorance that they do not know me.

*Imperial Annotation:* The knowledge of petty persons does not extend beyond official documents. Though they claim to know, they are in truth without knowledge—how could they comprehend the Dao?

*Minister’s Exegesis:* If they do not even know the source of words or the lord of affairs, how could they know me? To know me is to know the Dao.

“Those who know me are few—thus I am esteemed.”

*Imperial Annotation:* Those who possess conduct surpassing the world are reviled by the multitude. Those who harbor thoughts of solitary wisdom are startled by the people. Thus there are those who are valued for their rarity.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* My Dao is vast, so those who know it are few. Few know it—thus I am esteemed. Esteemed by the Dao, none confer rank upon me, yet I ever remain noble of myself. Therefore, the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within.

*Imperial Annotation:* The sage conceals himself in the world yet does not parade his constancy.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Possessing the Dao, he does not boast outwardly but retreats to store it in secrecy.

**Chapter Seventy-One: To Know Yet Not Know Is Supreme**

To know yet not know is supreme.

*Imperial Annotation:* The essence of the ultimate Dao is profound and obscure, its apex dark and silent. To know it externally is not true knowing; not to know it internally is true knowing. To know it superficially is shallow; not to know it is deep. To claim knowledge while not knowing—this is called the perfection of knowing the Dao, thus it is supreme.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* To cling to knowledge is to lose the Dao; to return to non-knowledge is to attain its supremacy.

“Not to know yet claim to know is a malady.”

*Imperial Annotation:* Not knowing the essence of the ultimate Dao yet knowing the coarse details of things, not knowing the apex of the ultimate Dao yet knowing the trivialities of affairs—ever entangled in trifles, ever ensnared by objects, they daily hasten toward the path of sorrow. Thus it is a malady.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Not knowing the Dao yet believing oneself to know—what they know are merely external things. To mistake such delusions for true knowledge is a grave malady.

“Only by recognizing the malady as a malady does one avoid malady.”

*Imperial Annotation:* To know one’s foolishness is not true foolishness. To know one’s confusion is not true confusion. The truly confused never awaken in their lifetime; the truly foolish never gain wisdom.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* To be afflicted yet unaware of the affliction is an incurable malady. Only by recognizing the malady does one avoid it. The sage’s freedom from malady lies in his recognition of the malady—thus he is without malady.

*Imperial Annotation:* The sage moves freely yet disdains entanglement in affairs, establishes the root and comprehends the divine. Possessing true knowledge, he yet appears as if he does not—thus he is without malady.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* The sage’s freedom from malady stems from true knowledge. Regarding knowledge as a malady, he constantly appears as if he does not know—thus he is without malady.

**Chapter Seventy-Two: When the People Do Not Fear Authority**

When the people do not fear authority, then great authority arrives.

*Imperial Annotation:* Petty persons regard minor transgressions as harmless and do not abandon them. Thus evil accumulates until it cannot be dispelled. The *Book of Changes* says, “Carrying a cangue until the ears are destroyed—calamity.”

*Minister’s Exegesis:* The people, lacking fear, ultimately plunge into disaster.

“Do not constrict their dwelling.”

*Imperial Annotation:* The dwelling is the abode of nature. Human nature is vast and cannot be confined, yet cramped scholars, unfit to discourse on the Dao, constrict their dwelling. Expand and fill it, and it will pervade Heaven and Earth, enveloping the six directions—nothing exists beyond its reach. Mencius said, “Dwell in the vastest dwelling of the world.”

*Minister’s Exegesis:* The abode of nature is the vastest dwelling in the world. Daily entangled with artificial things, it becomes obstructed and confined to a single corner—thus its dwelling is constricted.

“Do not stifle their life.”

*Imperial Annotation:* Life is the gathering of qi. Human life connects with the creations of things, yet those who stifle their life engage in daytime actions that shackle and lose it. Repeatedly bound and released, their nighttime qi is insufficient to sustain them. Only by preserving the great harmony without premature decay do they avoid stifling their life.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Humans are born from the Dao, their root originally unified. Unmoved by things, they connect with the creations of things. Yet when nature is stirred by emotion, emotion follows things astray—thus qi is lost, spirit is exhausted, essence is depleted, form departs, and life cannot be preserved. They stifle their life without realizing it. Embracing unity and returning to simplicity, preserving essence and embodying spirit, they attain longevity with the Dao—this is called not stifling their life.

Only by not stifling life does one not grow weary of it.

*Imperial Commentary:* Calamity and fortune are none but self-sought.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Not stifling one’s life, one’s life does not grow weary of itself. Thus the sage knows the self without displaying it, cherishes the self without exalting it. Therefore, they discard that and embrace this.

*Imperial Commentary:* The sage possesses the clarity of self-knowledge yet does not display it to flaunt ability. They hold the benevolence of self-love yet do not exalt themselves over others. Acting thus, they dwell among things without harming them, and nothing can harm them. Rejoicing in Heaven and free from care, what dread should they hold for power or wrath? The sage’s choice to discard or embrace is thus made clear.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* The sage’s spirit is whole within, so they truly know themselves. Not displaying themselves means they do not assert the self to dominate others. The Dao resides in them, so they truly cherish themselves. Not exalting themselves means they forget both self and others—how then could they value themselves above others? Those who constrict their dwelling and stifle their life, who display and exalt themselves, embody "that" which is discarded; its opposite is "this" which is embraced.

**Chapter 73**
Boldness in daring leads to death; boldness in restraint leads to life.

*Imperial Commentary:* The rigid and strong belong to the ranks of the dead. The soft and weak belong to the ranks of the living. Boldness in daring is mere recklessness—able to be bold but unable to be cautious, it is no true virtue but only hastens one’s destruction. Thus Confucius deemed Zilu’s love of courage as having "no redeeming quality."

Boldness in restraint knows how to hold back. Holding back is the way to precede others. As *Liezi* states, "The constant Dao of Heaven and Earth is softness."

*Minister’s Exegesis:* The recklessly bold lose themselves to violence; their nature is cruel, seeing others as mere straw. Thus their actions inevitably lead to death. Those who hold back do not underestimate opponents; their nature is compassionate, seeing the people as wounded. Thus their actions inevitably lead to life. These two paths bring either benefit or harm.

*Imperial Commentary:* What is correct may also err; what opposes may also align.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Boldness in killing pertains to the practice of warfare. Boldness in restraint pertains to the Dao of warfare. Dao and practice bring either benefit or harm—this much is evident. Yet as tactics shift unpredictably, what is correct may err, and what opposes may align.

Who knows the reason for Heaven’s aversion?

*Imperial Commentary:* Those who defy humanity align with Heaven. What humanity deems beneficial, Heaven deems harmful. Who can comprehend this?

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Boldness in daring and killing is what humanity deems beneficial, but what Heaven deems harmful—for Heaven’s virtue favors life. Humanity pursues what it deems beneficial without knowing Heaven’s aversion. Hence, who knows the reason? Thus even the sage finds this difficult.

*Imperial Commentary:* Those who follow Heaven endure; those who defy it perish. Even the sage does not dare act lightly.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* When Yu campaigned against the Sanmiao, he heeded Yi’s counsel—such was his caution. Thus the sage prioritizes following Heaven and does not dare act lightly.

The Dao of Heaven does not contend yet excels at victory.

*Imperial Commentary:* When the myriad things emerge, it emerges with them without refusal. When they return, it returns with them without obstruction. This is called "not contending." Through the ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness, it moves with things, and the multitude of beings all receive their mandate—this is called "not contending yet excelling at victory."

*Minister’s Exegesis:* When the myriad things are born, it allows them to be born of themselves. When they perish, it lets them perish of themselves, without contention. All things are sheltered under Heaven’s canopy and receive their mandate—thus its excellence in victory is supreme.

It does not speak yet excels at response.

*Imperial Commentary:* What does Heaven say? It transforms through thunder and wind, reveals through fortune and misfortune, with no deviation even by a hair’s breadth, yet with responses like echoes and shadows.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Good deeds bring blessings; evil deeds bring calamity. The correspondence of good and evil admits no deviation, even by a hair’s breadth—such is its excellence in response.

It does not summon yet comes of itself.

*Imperial Commentary:* When a mandate is received, the one who issues it can summon it. Yet the myriad things, though entangled, are governed by Heaven’s mandate—who can summon it? It moves ceaselessly, entrusting itself to the self-motion of the single qi.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* To be summoned and arrive is the duty of ministers and children. Heaven governs the mandate of the myriad things—its supremacy is such that none can summon it. The single qi moves of itself, not by external command.

It is vast and excels at planning.

*Imperial Commentary:* Virtuous conduct is ever unobstructed, thus aware of peril.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Ever unobstructed, it is vast; aware of peril, it excels at planning.

Heaven’s net is vast and wide, sparse yet never failing.

*Imperial Commentary:* Dense yet with gaps—this is the work of humans. Heaven, though sparse, admits no gaps. The accumulation of good and evil brings blessings and misfortunes, each arriving according to its kind—this is why it never fails.

Those who contend only then prevail, who speak only then respond—these are humans. Heaven does not contend yet excels at victory, does not speak yet excels at response, and when summoned, arrives. Humans find it difficult to know Heaven. Yet Heaven does not summon yet comes of itself, vast and excelling at planning. Only the sage can embody this. Thus they neither pursue profit nor avoid harm, ever benefiting without harm—thereby aligning with Heaven’s virtue, unlike those bold in daring.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Heaven’s sheltering of things makes no distinction between good and evil; its vastness is boundless—who can fathom its limits? Fortune and misfortune, blessings and disasters, each arrive according to their kind. Though their timing may vary, none escape retribution—thus it is said to never fail.

**Chapter 74**
The people constantly do not fear death—how can they be frightened with death?

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** The people possess constancy in their hearts, and life for them is joyous. If they lack this constancy, why should they fear death? When axes and saws govern them, inked cords execute them, hammers and chisels decide their fate—this is called frightening them with death. Yet the people will defy and transgress, never truly transformed.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* The people forget what they naturally cherish, losing the principle of preserving life whole. Customs carve them down, wear them out; they defy laws and flout prohibitions, until even the six relations cannot protect one another. Mired in mud and ashes, emaciated in ditches and gullies, their lives become no better than death—this is why they do not fear death. If the ruler does not govern by the Dao, so that the people cease to fear death, yet still seeks to frighten them with death in hopes of restoring order—is this not exceedingly difficult?

If the people were constantly in awe of death and some acted perversely, would I not seize and execute them—who would dare? **Wang Bi’s Commentary:** When the world delights in life and dreads violating the law, only then are those who speak perversely punished and those who act strangely restrained. As Xunzi said, the crime of defying governance is indeed grave.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* When the people know life is joyous, they know death is fearful. Fearing death, they dread violating the law. There is always an executioner who kills; to kill in place of the executioner is to take the place of the master carpenter’s hewing. **Wang Bi’s Commentary:** The ruler must practice non-action and employ the world; the ministers must act and be employed by the world—this is the unchanging Dao. To kill in place of the executioner, to hew in place of the master carpenter, is for ruler and minister to share the same virtue, inverting the Dao in speech and delighting in what contravenes it. What men govern, how can it govern men? King Wen did not personally oversee every word, every case, every caution—only the officials and shepherds of the people were responsible for this.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Non-action is the ruler’s Dao; action is the minister’s Dao. The ruler is noble, the minister base; the distinction between above and below is constant and never confused. The ruler relies on the completion of those below; the ministers serve diligently and revere those above—thus great order is achieved. The state has fixed punishments; the executioner kills. If one usurps that killing, then killing is not by statute, and the punishment is unjust. This is like taking the place of the master carpenter’s hewing—only to wound oneself. For he who takes the place of the master carpenter’s hewing, few escape injuring their hands.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** If even hewing in another’s place risks injury, how much more so killing? This is why the ancients prized non-action. Through non-action, those responsible for affairs bear their duty.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* To assign tasks beyond one’s proper role is to err. The master carpenter uses axe and adze; to take his place is to wound one’s hand. The executioner’s duty is punishment and execution; to take his place is to make punishments excessive. Thus one harms the people—and harming the people is to harm oneself.

**Chapter 75**
The people’s hunger arises from their ruler’s excessive taxation—this is why they hunger.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** Heavy taxes leave fields and wastelands overgrown; the people lack sufficient food.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* The five grains are what the people rely on to live, yet the ruler’s taxes are excessive—thus the people’s food is insufficient.

The people’s unruliness arises from their ruler’s excessive action—this is why they are unruly.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** When governance is overbearing, deceit and falsehood flourish; the people lose their simplicity.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* The more the ruler acts, the more the people respond with cunning—this is why they are unruly.

People’s disregard for death arises from their excessive devotion to preserving life—this is why they disregard death.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** When attachment to life is too great, desire for profit stirs intensely. Waywardness, depravity, excess, and extravagance—nothing is left undone.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Excessive attachment to life leads to endless craving, harming life without self-love.

Only those who do not treat life as something to be clung to are superior to those who prize life.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** *Zhuangzi* says: "Those who grasp the truth of life do not strive for what is of no use to life." Those who do not treat life as something to be clung to do not strive for what is of no use to life. They abandon affairs and forget life—thus abandoning affairs spares the body from labor, and forgetting life preserves the essence from depletion. Body whole, essence restored, they unite with Heaven—this is why they are superior to those who prize life. Prizing life differs from disregarding death; forgetting life is superior to prizing life. Extending what benefits one’s own life to the people—lightening taxes, simplifying punishments, ensuring every household is provided for and every person content—then even with distinct clothing and emblems, the people will not transgress. This is the ultimate achievement of emperors and kings.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Those who do not treat life as something to be clung to follow the natural course of principle. They do not strive to act for the sake of life. For if they do not possess life, their life remains perpetually whole. The body is not wearied by affairs; the essence is not depleted of its wholeness—this is the reason. Prizing life is superior to disregarding death, yet knowing life is precious, they still do not understand that preserving life whole is the foundation.

**Chapter 76**
In life, people are supple and weak; in death, they are rigid and strong. In life, plants and trees are tender and fragile; in death, they are withered and dry. Thus the rigid and strong are followers of death; the supple and weak are followers of life.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** All things bear yin and embrace yang, blending qi to achieve harmony. Yang’s virtue is to engender; yin’s duty is to bring about decay. When decay prevails, the harmonious qi is lost. Thus it is said: the rigid and strong are followers of death; the supple and weak are followers of life.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* Supple weakness is the function of the Dao—thus it is a follower of life. Those who are harsh and overbearing do not meet their proper end—thus they are followers of death. In death, the harmonious qi is lost, and the principle of life is reversed—hence rigidity and strength. Therefore, when armies are strong, they do not prevail.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** When opposing forces clash, the sorrowful side wins.

*Minister’s Exegesis:* To rely on strength for victory is to invite defeat.

When trees are strong, they are felled and used.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** The slender paulownia and catalpa, everyone knows to nurture them. When they grow strong, they are cut down and put to use.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** When trees are strong, they are felled. Thus, the rigid and strong remain below, while the supple and weak reside above.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** That the soft overcomes the hard and the weak overcomes the strong—this is where the Daoist arts of Laozi lie. *Zhuangzi* says: "Take meekness, humility, and deference as one’s outward bearing."

**Minister’s Exegesis:** Laozi takes softness and weakness as the root; the subtlety of the Daoist arts lies herein.

**Chapter 77**
The Way of Heaven—is it not like the drawing of a bow?
What is high is pressed down, what is low is lifted up.
What has surplus is diminished, what is deficient is replenished.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** The Dao neither adds nor subtracts; things have their fullness and emptiness. That which is poured into yet never fills, drawn from yet never exhausts—this is what the sage preserves. Descending into things, Heaven and Earth wax and wane, ebb and flow with the seasons—how much more so for man?

The Way of Heaven takes the mean as its perfection. Thus, what is high is pressed down so it does not exceed, what is low is lifted up so it does not fall short. What is to come advances, what has succeeded retreats; the four seasons turn, each in its proper order.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** Increase and decrease, fullness and emptiness—these alternate and revolve, ever returning from extremes, all rooted in spontaneity. What is high and in surplus is in a state of excess and abundance, thus it must be pressed down and diminished. What is low and deficient is in a state of loss and depletion, thus it must be lifted up and replenished. All follows the principle of spontaneity. Therefore, the Way of Heaven is like the drawing of a bow: it ceases only when the mean is attained.

The Way of Heaven diminishes the surplus to replenish the deficient.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** Fullness invites loss; humility gains increase. Such is the Way of Heaven.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** It abhors fullness, thus it diminishes the surplus. It favors humility, thus it replenishes the deficient.

The Way of Man is not so: it diminishes the deficient to serve the surplus.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** The human heart rejects the lowly and advances the exalted, oppresses the solitary and fears the eminent.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** It exploits the deficient and diminishes them, seeking its own gain. It fears the surplus and serves them, seeking its own gratification.

Who can diminish the surplus to serve the deficient in the world? Only the Dao.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** It does not oppress the solitary but bestows upon the destitute. It does not fear the eminent but reduces the abundant. None but the man of the Dao can do this.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** It bestows upon the destitute, freeing them from the burden of insufficiency. It reduces the abundant, sparing them the disaster of excess. Only the Dao is capable of this.

Thus, the sage acts yet does not rely on his actions; he accomplishes yet does not dwell in his achievements. Is it not that he does not wish to display his worth?

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** He does not rely on his actions, thus he has no heart for self-boasting. He does not dwell in his achievements, thus he has no will to self-satisfaction. While others adorn their wisdom, he alone remains as if foolish. While others seek victory, he alone bends to preserve wholeness. Only by not wishing to display his worth does he remain undiminished, attaining the Way of Heaven.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** The sage embodies the Dao in the world, thus he can offer his surplus to the world—not relying on that surplus. He acts yet does not rely on his actions; he accomplishes yet does not dwell in his achievements. He does not wish to boast or be self-satisfied to display his worth. Worth here refers to his deeds. The surplus is his own Dao: he awakens later awakenings with his prior awakening, enlightens later understandings with his prior understanding. Extending this to light taxes and modest levies, he disperses benefits throughout the world rather than hoarding them above—all of which is what is meant by offering his surplus to the world. Only by not displaying his worth do those below remain unaware of the ruler’s power. This is how the sage shares the virtue of Heaven. Thus it is said: he attains the Way of Heaven.

**Chapter 78**
In the world, nothing is more supple and weak than water, yet in attacking the rigid and strong, none can surpass it, for there is nothing by which it can be replaced.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** The *Book of Changes* uses the well to illustrate nature, speaking of its unchanging quality. Laozi calls water "near to the Dao," for there is nothing by which it can be replaced. If there were something to replace it, it would follow others and lose itself—how could it overcome things? Only because there is nothing to replace it does it remain constant through ten thousand changes, and nothing can overcome it.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** The nature of water is to conform to vessels and assume their shapes, bending or straight, square or round, changing with them. Utterly soft and weak, yet in attacking the rigid and strong, none can surpass it. This is because its nature does not change, its essence ever abides in unity. This is how softness and weakness secure their victory.

That the soft overcomes the hard and the weak overcomes the strong—none in the world does not know this, yet none can practice it.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** Knowledge reaches it, but benevolence cannot preserve it.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** Observing how water attacks the rigid and strong, none does not know that softness and weakness prevail—this is the reach of knowledge. Yet none can practice it because the self clings to a love of victory, and benevolence cannot preserve it.

Thus, the sage says: He who bears the world’s disgrace is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain. He who bears the world’s misfortune is called the king of all under Heaven.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** Rivers and marshes receive filth; mountains and forests harbor pests. The lord of a state endures disgrace, embodying the emptiness of the Dao. The broader his capacity to receive, the more things return to him, and the farther his dominion extends. The *Classic* says: "Know its glory, guard its disgrace, and be the valley of the world."

**Minister’s Exegesis:** Water is near to the Dao, thus the sage models his virtue on water: soft, weak, and humble, bearing disgrace and receiving filth, containing all without distinction of good or evil, great or small, pure or foul, near or far. Thus he can be lord of the altars of soil and grain and king of all under Heaven.

Straight words seem contrary.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** Words are not confined to one form. Opposing things yet aligning with the Dao—this is called the utmost correctness in the world.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** To call one who bears disgrace and misfortune the lord of the altars of soil and grain and king of all under Heaven—these are the sage’s straight words.

To speak thus seems contrary to custom, for it is by opposing custom that one attains correctness. Hence it is said: opposing things yet aligning with the Dao—this is called the utmost correctness in the world.

**Chapter 79: Reconciling Great Resentment**
To reconcile great resentment is necessarily to leave residual resentment. How can this be deemed good?

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** The towering tree, though unbroken by the storm’s trunk, may yet be struck by a flying tile—yet it bears no lingering resentment. Thus, there is no residual resentment. To love others is the root of harming them. To lay down arms is the root of forging them. How can this be deemed good?

**Minister’s Exegesis:** Those skilled in governing others in antiquity made them govern themselves, rather than imposing governance upon them. The nature of the people is swayed by profit and desire, leading them to excess, contention, and strife, seeking only the fulfillment of their wants. When those above establish prohibitions, punishments, and executions to govern them in every way, the world cannot attain its desires, and thus resentment arises. Great resentment stems from the people’s great desires, for they are denied what they seek, hence it is called great resentment. Because the people harbor such resentment, those above then seek to reconcile and restrain it with ritual, music, education, rewards, punishments, and decrees—yet the world’s residual resentment only grows. Thus, the sage holds the left tally.

Therefore, the sage holds the left tally and does not make demands of others.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** The sage follows great transformations without obstruction, receiving all with joy. Thus, he makes no demands of others, and others make none of him. Tallies have left and right to distinguish giving and receiving. To hold the left tally is simply to give.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** Holding the left tally means acting without contrivance, entrusting all to spontaneity. Not engaging with things, one allows the myriad beings to arrive of themselves, responding to their arrival and harmonizing with them. One constantly bears the world’s burdens yet never imposes them on others.

Thus, one of power holds the tally.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** To apportion to others by virtue is called sageliness.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** The power of non-power is how one holds the tally.

One without power enforces thoroughness.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** To delight in connecting with things is not sageliness. One without power does not attain his own attainment but seeks the attainment of others. Ever striving to connect with things, harboring a mind to reconcile resentment—this is thoroughness, which only becomes an obstruction. As *Zhuangzi* says: "One who loses himself in things is called a benighted person."

**Minister’s Exegesis:** To gain nothing for oneself yet seek thoroughness in things is utter benightedness.

The Dao of Heaven shows no partiality; it constantly accords with the good.

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** If one is good, it accords with him—what partiality is there?

**Minister’s Exegesis:** Reconciling great resentment cannot be deemed good or possessed of power. One who holds the tally is called good, and thus the Dao of Heaven accords with him.

**Chapter 80: A Small State with Few People**

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** Vast lands and teeming people bring affairs too numerous to manage and wisdom too strained to discern; virtue declines from this, and punishments arise from this. The disorders of later ages begin here. When Master Lao lived at the end of the Zhou, he wearied of its chaos and sought the intent of the Dao, embedding it in his writings. He aimed to remedy the corruption of excessive refinement and elevate society to a realm of purity and simplicity. Thus he spoke of a small state with few people. For in the age of utmost virtue—from Rongcheng to Shennong, twelve rulers in all—those hailed as paragons of governance achieved this alone.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** A small state means its affairs are easily governed; few people means desires are readily satisfied. Affairs easily governed lead to the forgetting of cunning and calculation; desires readily satisfied leave no room for artifice and deceit. Only then can one return to simplicity and restore antiquity.

*"Let the people possess tools a hundredfold in number yet not employ them."*

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** Unified and impartial, free from the burdens of multitudes.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** Each person abides in their station and fulfills their life; without the encumbrance of cliques or factions, though tools may be a hundredfold, they have no use for them.

*"Let the people hold death in awe and not wander far."*

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** Life is joyous, death is fitting for burial—thus the people do not treat death lightly or scatter to the four directions. Confucius said: "When those above lose the Way, the people have long been dispersed." Does this not refer to distant wandering?

**Minister’s Exegesis:** Knowing life’s joys, they cherish their existence—thus they hold death in awe. Recognizing their livelihood as their foundation, they delight in their work—thus they do not wander far.

*"Though there be boats and carriages, none shall ride them. Though there be armor and weapons, none shall array them."*

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** Mountains have no paths or tunnels; marshes have no boats or bridges. Alike in their unknowing, their virtue does not depart. Without traces of perilous traverses, though there be boats and carriages, none shall ride them. Without the affliction of attack or war, though there be armor and weapons, none shall array them.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** At peace with their lot, delighting in their work, they have no cause for movement. Though there be boats and carriages, none shall ride them, for they have no cause for contention. Though there be armor and weapons, none shall array them, for they are content with their nature and joyful in self-sufficiency.

*"Let the people return to knotting cords for use."*

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** It suffices for recording essentials; no need for written contracts.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** Where mistrust arises, written contracts appear. When the people return to antiquity, they trust in knotted cords.

*"Sweet be their food, fine be their garments, secure be their customs, joyful be their work."*

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** They till to eat, weave to clothe, play with food in their mouths, and wander with bellies full—this is all the people need. Content with their portion, thus their food is sweet; eschewing adornment, thus their garments are fine; undisturbed, thus their customs are secure; preserving life, thus their work is joyful.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** Sweet be their food—not from rich flavors, but from sweetness in their allotted portion. Fine be their garments—not from embroidered silks, but from the fineness of their clothing. Secure in their dwellings, they find no place where they are not at ease. Joyful in their customs, they find no circumstance where they are not content.

*"Though neighboring states are within sight, and the sounds of cocks and dogs are heard, the people shall grow old and die without ever visiting one another."*

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** They dwell in proximity, their voices carry to one another, yet they do not visit—at such a time, without desires or demands, nothing is done yet all is naturally so. This is called utmost virtue.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** Sighing in benevolence, standing alone in righteousness—this is why the people value visitation. In an age of utmost virtue, the people forget one another in the realm of self-sufficiency, desiring nothing for themselves, seeking nothing from others. Though they see and hear one another, they grow old and die without visiting. How then could there be the corruption of arrogance, pretense, or mutual flattery?

---

**Chapter Eighty-One**

*"Truthful words are not beautiful."*

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** The Dao uttered is bland, without flavor. It transcends all sages without shame and endures through the ages without flaw.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** Truthful words are true to the Dao, not merely what people prefer. They cannot be bent to俗 taste—hence the world does not find them beautiful.

*"Beautiful words are not truthful."*

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** Ornate speech is florid; pursuing embellished phrases, taking branches for the essence, thus it lacks truth.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** Beautiful words may please people, but they are not true to the Dao—hence they fall short in truth.

*"The good do not dispute."*

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** Their words uphold essentials, speaking only what accords with the law.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** The good need no argument to make their goodness clear—thus their words are concise and not wasteful.

*"The disputatious are not good."*

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** Excessive branching and digressions lose the world’s utmost rightness.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** Disputation seeks clarity, but prolixity lacks principle—hence it is not good.

*"The wise are not learned."*

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** Those who grasp the Dao’s subtlety return to essentials.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** The Dao is one—it cannot be known through learning. Returning to essentials is reverting to unknowing; what need is there for learning?

*"The learned are not wise."*

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** The multitude of hearsay is not as good as restraint. *Zhuangzi* says: "Learning does not necessarily bring wisdom; disputation does not necessarily bring intelligence."

**Minister’s Exegesis:** Learning burdens the mind with excess; the more one learns, the more one strays outward. Knowledge comes from without, hence it boasts of its breadth. Self-knowledge knows one’s nature; knowing one’s nature knows Heaven—thus restraint is better.

*"The sage accumulates nothing."*

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** To accumulate is to be insufficient; to store nothing is to have surplus. *Zhuangzi* says: "The sagely Dao moves without accumulation." Confucius said: "I daily diminish."

**Minister’s Exegesis:** The sage is utterly empty, without thing—what accumulation could there be? This emptiness supplies the world’s myriad demands. If one accumulates and then disperses, the accumulation will eventually be exhausted. Only without accumulation does the sagely Dao operate.

*"Having acted for others, he has more; having given to others, he has much."*

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** He lends and completes, yet never depletes himself. All things turn to him for resources, yet he is never lacking.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** What others cannot do, awaiting him to do—this is called "acting for others." What others lack, awaiting him to provide—this is called "giving." The sage’s actions and gifts all arise from the Dao—thus he incurs no cost to himself and no depletion.

*"The Way of Heaven benefits and does not harm."*

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** Qian begins by beautifully benefiting all under Heaven. It does not speak of its beneficence, yet things are truly benefited—it has never harmed.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** It gives life to what naturally lives, completes what naturally completes, beautifully benefits the myriad things without claiming beneficence—what harm could there be? This is the Way of Heaven.

*"The Way of the sage acts and does not contend."*

**Wang Bi’s Commentary:** Following without opposing, its movement is like water. Responding without hoarding, its stillness is like a mirror. Harmonizing without leading, its response is like an echo. Though it acts, its action arises from non-action. It embodies Heaven—what contention could there be? This virtue aligns with the Dao—thus the *Dejing* concludes here.

**Minister’s Exegesis:** The sage empties himself to respond to the world, acts without acting to embody the Dao, entrusts the self-moving qi, and lets the myriad things follow their nature. In movement, it is sudden, like water flowing without opposition. In stillness, it is luminous, like a mirror reflecting without hoarding.

When things arise, they respond like an echo—such action emerges from non-being. With non-action, there is no self; with no self, there is no other. Self and other both forgotten, what contention could there be? To act without contending is to embody the Dao.

Master Lao elucidated the meaning of virtue and the Dao, with its essence lying in softness, weakness, and non-contention as the foundation. Thus, he concluded with the sage’s Way of acting without contending. Only those who attain the Dao can be likened to this, and so he spoke of it at the end of the *Virtue Classic*.

*The Exegesis on the Authentic Classic of Dao and Virtue by Emperor Huizong of Song, Scroll Ten, concludes.*
