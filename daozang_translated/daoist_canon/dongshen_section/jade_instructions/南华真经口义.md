**Preface to *Oral Explications of the Zhuangzi***

Zhuangzi was a native of Song, named Zhou, styled Zixiu, born in Meng County of Suiyang. Flourishing at the beginning of the Warring States period, he was a contemporary of Mencius, a recluse who spoke freely and without restraint. The book bearing his name is divided into three parts: seven Inner Chapters, fifteen Outer Chapters, and eleven Miscellaneous Chapters. Though thus arranged, the three modes of expression—*yuyan* (parables), *zhongyan* (weighty sayings), and *zhiyan* (spontaneous words)—pervade the entire work. The Outer and Miscellaneous Chapters take their titles from their opening lines, while the Inner Chapters bear thematic names, each with its own significance. Their language is more refined than that of the Outer and Miscellaneous Chapters, yet the intent behind their words differs not at all.

Chen Tongfu once remarked: "The world cannot do without such a man, nor without such a book, for only then can the discourse of the noble person be complete." Though the *Zhuangzi* may be deemed unorthodox, it is in truth indispensable. Guo Zixuan called it the crown of the Hundred Schools despite its heterodoxy—a most just assessment. Yet this book, while essential, is also the most difficult to read. Su Dongpo’s entire literary corpus was enlightened by its insights. The five thousand and forty volumes of the *Great Treasury of Scriptures* were all meticulously distilled from its depths. The narrative power of Zuo Qiuming and Sima Zichang pales in comparison—how could one not read it?

Yet why is it called difficult? As Master Yichuan observed: "Buddhist texts are like seductive music and alluring beauty, easily bewitching the mind, for their words are stirring and their appearances deceptive." How much more so with this book? Its discussions of benevolence, righteousness, nature, and destiny differ in terminology from our own classics—this is the first difficulty. Its intent is to rival the teachings of our Master Confucius, so its language often exceeds proper bounds—this is the second difficulty. It addresses the coarse and vulgar as if expounding the highest Mahayana doctrines, so its words frequently soar too high—this is the third difficulty. Its brushwork dances and transforms in ways that cannot be traced through ordinary literary paths—this is the fourth difficulty. Moreover, its linguistic threads and spiritual thrusts resemble the "sword’s edge" of Chan sudden enlightenment, a style absent in our Confucian texts—this is the fifth difficulty.

Only one well-versed in the *Analects*, *Mencius*, *Doctrine of the Mean*, and *Great Learning*, with a firm grasp of principle, an understanding of textual veins, and knowledge of Chan techniques, can discern its meaning, finding each word and phrase grounded in truth. Though its style is unrestrained and playful, its grand principles and fundamental aims never deviate from the Sage’s Way. Without such discernment, one may impose arbitrary interpretations, either dismissing it as heretical and perverse or being swayed by its allure, leading to licentiousness or emptiness. Thus, Master Yichuan’s warning about "seductive music and alluring beauty" is not to be taken lightly.

I, Xi Yi, once heard of this work from Le Xuan, and through him, of Ai Xuan’s teachings, gaining a rough understanding of its textual veins. After extensive study of Buddhist texts, I grasped its mechanisms of free and transformative expression, believing I had attained some insight into this book—insights unexhausted by previous scholars. Later, I encountered the commentaries of Lü Jifu and Wang Yuanzhe, which, though more detailed in chapter and verse than Guo Xiang’s, obscured its grand purpose. Their interpretations only deepened doubts about the *Zhuangzi*. Yet in my humble view, this book stands alone in the world, never having offended the teachings of the Sage. If Zhuangzi were to return today, he might well say, "A thousand years later, only Ziyun (Yang Xiong) could match me." I do not presume to elevate it to the level of its author but merely share these reflections with fellow seekers.

—Preface by Lin Xiyi of Yuanzhai

Zhuangzi was a native of Song, named Zhou, styled Zixiu. Born in Meng County of Suiyang, he once served as the keeper of the Lacquer Garden in Meng. His learning was vast, but its essence returned to the words of Laozi. Thus, he composed a book of over a hundred thousand words, mostly in the form of parables. His language flowed freely and unconstrained, suiting only himself, so even kings and nobles could not employ him.

King Wei of Chu, hearing of Zhuang Zhou’s worthiness, sent envoys with generous gifts to invite him, offering the position of prime minister. Zhuangzi laughed and said to the envoys: "A thousand gold pieces are a great profit; the office of minister is a lofty rank. Have you not seen the sacrificial ox of the suburban rites? Fed for years and adorned with embroidered robes, it is led into the great temple. At that moment, if it wished to be a solitary piglet, could it do so? Begone quickly, and do not defile me! I would rather roam and play in the filth of ditches, delighting in myself, than be fettered by rulers. I will never serve, that my will may be fulfilled."

During the Tang dynasty, he was posthumously enfeoffed as the True Man of Nanhua, and his book was titled the *True Scripture of Nanhua*.

**Oral Explications of the *True Scripture of Nanhua*, Volume One**
*By Lin Xiyi of Yanzhai*

The "Free and Easy Wandering" is the title established for this chapter. The Inner Chapters number seven, each named with three characters. *Wandering* signifies the mind’s roaming through the heavens; *free and easy* describes a state of unconstrained ease. In the *Analects*, the disciples depict the Master with but a single word—*joy*; in the *Three Hundred Poems*, when portraying figures such as "the forlorn tree in the south" or "the terrace on Southern Mountain," they say, "Joyful is the noble man"—again, but a single word, *joy*. Thus, what this chapter calls *free and easy wandering* is precisely what the *Poetry* and the *Analects* mean by *joy*. The entire work begins with this single word, *joy*—consider then the vastness of this old man’s heart! If one can perceive even a trace of its savor here, then one may proceed to read the poem *Fou Yi*. That poem depicts the joy within the heart, yet without ever uttering the word *joy*—its artistry lies in this very subtlety, like ascending a seven-tiered pagoda to find yet another level above.

"In the Northern Darkness there is a fish, and its name is Kun. The Kun’s greatness—no one knows how many thousand *li* it spans. It transforms into a bird, and its name is Peng. The Peng’s back—no one knows how many thousand *li* it stretches. When it rises in fury and takes flight, its wings are like clouds hanging from the sky. This bird, when the sea surges, will journey to the Southern Darkness. The Southern Darkness is the Celestial Pond.

*The Equalizing Harmony* is a record of marvels. It states: When the Peng journeys to the Southern Darkness, it strikes the water for three thousand *li*, spiraling upon the whirlwind to ascend ninety thousand *li*, departing with the winds of the sixth month. The *wild horses*, the dust motes—all living things are blown aloft by one another’s breath. The azure of the sky—is that its true color? Or is it so distant that it has no end? From above, its view of what lies below is no different.

Moreover, if the water’s accumulation is not deep, it lacks the strength to bear a great vessel. Pour a cup of water into a hollow in the hall, and a mustard seed becomes a boat; place a cup there, and it sticks fast—too shallow for so large a vessel. If the wind’s accumulation is not deep, it lacks the strength to bear great wings. Thus, at ninety thousand *li*, the wind lies beneath. Only then, with the wind as its foundation, its back against the blue sky and nothing to obstruct it, does it at last set its course southward.

The cicada and the fledgling dove laugh at it, saying: ‘We burst forth and fly, striking the elm and sandalwood, and if we do not reach them, we simply alight upon the ground. Why go ninety thousand *li* to the south?’ This passage merely depicts the boundless joy within the heart, employing such metaphors to convey its meaning. It suggests that human vision is narrow, hence the ceaseless strife of the mundane world. But if one knows that beyond heaven and earth lie such vast realms, one sees oneself as but a single grain in the granary of Tai—insignificant beyond measure. This is the same idea as Dai Jinren’s ‘warring ants on a snail’s horn.’

The Northern Darkness is the Northern Sea; the names Kun and Peng are but allegory. Some interpret them through the lens of yin and yang, but this is merely forcing divisions where none exist. That a bird’s flight must rely on the qi below—this ‘fury’ is already extraordinary. *Sea surging* means the sea in motion; even today, folk songs from coastal regions speak of the ‘sixth-month sea surge.’ Such surges arise from great winds, their waters churning from the ocean’s depths, their roar audible for miles. The passage insists that only such winds can carry the Peng southward. The Southern Darkness is also a sea, yet Zhuangzi calls it the Celestial Pond.

*The Equalizing Harmony* is the name of a book, its records filled with strange and extraordinary events, much like the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*. Yet this book may not have existed at all; Zhuangzi, having crafted this tale, then cites it as proof—another instance of his playful artistry. *Spiraling* describes its flight; *whirlwind* refers to the wind’s force. The numbers three thousand and ninety thousand simply convey its vast height and distance. *Departing with the winds of the sixth month* means this bird’s journeys require half a year’s rest before it can move again.

The three lines about *wild horses* and *dust motes* are among the most extraordinary in his writing, though they seem disconnected from what precedes or follows. *Wild horses* are drifting filaments, water vapor—what Du Fu called ‘fallen blossoms and drifting filaments, white days at peace.’ The question is: whence do these *wild horses* and *dust motes* arise? They are but the breath of living things, blown aloft by one another’s qi, filling the emptiness of space. These lines are meant to set up the next, yet they are placed here first: when one gazes upward at the sky, seeing its azure hue, is that its true color? Or is it merely that our vision fails, unable to reach its limit, so that all we perceive is a hazy expanse? The Peng, having flown to the heavens, looks down upon the world below—how many tens of thousands of *li* lie between? The breath of *wild horses* and *dust motes* must appear just as hazy, like the view from below looking up. These few lines, depicting the Peng’s lofty flight, achieve a marvelous effect. If one were to interpret the Peng as vast and the *wild horses* and *dust motes* as tiny, the passage would lose its coherence, its power unraveling.

The line about the water’s accumulation not being deep serves as a metaphor for the wind below. A *hollow in the hall* is a depression in the floor; with so little water, it can only float a mustard seed. Place a cup there, and it sticks fast—*sticks* as in *glued*, meaning it cannot move, for the water is too shallow for so large a vessel. The Peng, ninety thousand *li* above the earth, with winds rising from the river valleys to fill the four seas—this wind lies beneath it. *Foundation* means depth; only a wind of ninety thousand *li* can be called deep. Such a wind alone can bear the Peng’s great wings."

Its back bears the azure sky—this speaks of its soaring height; "no obstacle blocks its way"—this means no hindrance exists. *Tu-nan*: from the Northern Sea it plans its southward migration. *Tu* means "to plan." The *tiao* is the cicada; the *yujiao* is the fledgling dove learning to fly. *Yu* may also be written as *鸒*, pronounced *yu*, and is merely another small bird—both characters are interchangeable. *Jue-qi* means to surge upward in flight; *qiang* means to dash forward. When it surges upward to dash toward the elm or sandalwood, it rises no more than a few feet, and sometimes fails even to reach that height, falling back to the ground instead. *Kong* means "to cast down"—it says, "My flight goes no higher than this, and often falls short. Yet that creature would rely on a wind of ninety thousand *li* to migrate south to the Celestial Pond—what use is that to it, and how could it serve?" This means that those of shallow vision and narrow capacity do not comprehend the vastness of the world.

One who journeys to the *mangcang* returns after three meals, his belly still full; one bound for a hundred *li* lodges the night before to hull grain; one traveling a thousand *li* gathers provisions for three months. What do these two insects know? "Lesser knowledge cannot reach greater knowledge; short years cannot reach long years"—how do we know this is so? The morning mushroom knows nothing of dusk and dawn; the cicada knows nothing of spring and autumn—these are short-lived creatures. South of Chu there is the *Mingling*, which takes five hundred years as its spring and five hundred years as its autumn; in high antiquity there was the Great *Chun*, which takes eight thousand years as its spring and eight thousand years as its autumn. Yet Pengzu alone is renowned for his longevity—if ordinary people compare themselves to him, is it not lamentable?

The *mangcang* is a land within a single glance, hazy and indistinct. If I were to journey there, going and returning would take no more than three meals, and my belly would still be full. *Guo* means "full"—the food has not yet been digested, showing how near it is. To travel a hundred *li*, one must hull grain the night before, for the journey cannot be made on three meals alone. For a thousand-*li* journey, one must gather provisions for three months. These three lines illustrate that human travel varies in distance, and thus the food required varies in quantity—just as human perception varies in scope, so too do aspirations differ in reach. This is another metaphor for the Peng and the cicada-dove.

The "two insects" refer to the cicada and the dove. It says, "What could they possibly know of this?"—hence, "what do they know?" "Lesser knowledge cannot reach greater knowledge; short years cannot reach long years"—these two lines form another structural unit in the text. The first line, on lesser and greater knowledge, concludes the earlier comparison of the Peng and the dove, while the second, on short and long years, introduces the next set of analogies.

The morning mushroom is the great *zhi*, also called the "sun-fungus," which grows on dung. It sprouts at dawn and dies at sunset. It knows only morning and evening—how could it know of the waxing and waning of the moon? The *huigū* is the winter cicada, born in spring and dying in summer, or born in summer and dying in autumn. It does not witness the full cycle of the four seasons—hence, it is short-lived. The *Mingling* is the name of a tree, as is the Great *Chun*. This is also a parable and need not be taken literally. It says that the *Mingling* takes a thousand years to complete one year, and the Great *Chun* takes sixteen thousand years to complete one year. Pengzu lived only eight hundred years, yet today he is uniquely renowned for his longevity. People all admire him but cannot match him—this too is a case of seeing the small but not the great. *Jiu* means "longevity"; *pi* means "to admire and seek to emulate."

This is the same as Tang’s question to Ji. Beyond the barren north lies the Dark Sea—the Celestial Pond. There is a fish there, thousands of *li* in breadth, its length unknown, called the *Kun*. There is a bird there called the Peng, its back like Mount Tai, its wings like clouds hanging from the sky. It mounts the whirlwind and spirals upward ninety thousand *li*, piercing the clouds and bearing the azure sky, then plans its southward journey to reach the Southern Darkness. The *chiyan* laughs at it, saying: "Where is it going? I leap and soar upward no more than a few yards before descending, wheeling among the mugwort and wormwood—this is the height of flight. Where could *it* be going?" This is the distinction between small and great.

This passage merely restates the previous one as further evidence. It says that Tang once questioned Ji about this very matter. *Ji* is the name of a person. *Shi yi* means "it is so." This line serves to link the conclusion below, using the closing words as the opening—this is where the prose gains its momentum. *Qiongfa* means "barren land"; *fuyao* refers to the force of the wind; *yangjiao* describes the wind’s spiraling motion; *tuan* means "to soar"; "piercing the clouds" means that ninety thousand *li* above, there are no more clouds. People say that atop Mount Tai, clouds lie below, and thunder sounds like an infant’s cry—yet today it is also said that clouds only reach halfway up the sky. *Tu-nan* means "to plan a journey to the Southern Darkness." It speaks of devising a southward migration before setting out for the Southern Sea.

The *chi* is a small marsh; the *chiyan* is a tiny bird. "The height of flight" means that its wheeling among the mugwort and wormwood is flight’s ultimate joy—why should it go elsewhere? Its meaning is the same as in the previous passage. Thus, those whose knowledge suffices for a single office, whose conduct is compared to a single village, whose virtue matches a single lord and whose proof lies in a single state—they regard themselves in the same way. Yet Song Rongzi would still laugh at them. Though the whole world praises them, they are not encouraged; though the whole world blames them, they are not disheartened. They have settled the distinction between inner and outer, discerned the boundary between honor and disgrace—this is all. In their relation to the world, they are not frantically active. Even so, they have yet to establish their true foundation.

Liezi rode the wind in flight, soaring with effortless grace, and only after fifteen days did he return. Though he sought no frantic pursuit of fortune, this was still to rely on something. Even if one is spared the toil of walking, one still depends on external conditions.

As for one who rides the inherent purity of Heaven and Earth, who harnesses the transformations of the six qi—yin and yang, wind and rain, darkness and light—and roams the boundless, what does such a one depend upon? Thus it is said: the Perfected One has no self, the Spirit Man has no merit, the Sage has no name.

"Knowledge suffices for a single office" means one’s intelligence is adequate to manage the affairs of one post. "Conduct is compared to a single village" means one’s virtue and conduct can align with a whole village, drawing people to follow. "Virtue is recognized by a single lord" means one has met with favor and can rally an entire state—this refers to governing a nation’s affairs. These three types of people each take satisfaction in their own abilities, regarding themselves much like the marsh pipit. Song Rongzi perceives the greater truth.

*You ran* describes his laughing expression. Song Rongzi’s character was such that, though the whole world praised or blamed him, he remained unmoved, paying it no heed. Compared to those who content themselves with a village or a state, he saw only cause for amusement. Yet how was Song Rongzi able to achieve this? He recognized the original heart as inner and all things as outer—thus he "settled the distinction between inner and outer." What lies outside may bring honor or disgrace, but what lies within knows neither. Understanding this division, he could discern that honor and disgrace are merely external conditions. "This is all" means the principle extends no further.

Since he valued the original heart and dismissed external things as trivial, how could he be frantically preoccupied with worldly affairs? *Frantic* describes such restless striving. Though Song Rongzi’s ability was indeed as described, he had yet to establish a true foundation.

As for Liezi, he could ride the wind and travel through the void, returning only after half a month. When he rode the wind, he moved with a light, graceful ease—*effortless grace* describes his floating, drifting manner. *Effortless* means drifting, *grace* means beauty. Having mastered wind-borne flight, he would not deign to pursue fortune through self-cultivation with anxious haste. *Not frantic* means he would not stoop to such restless striving as others. While ordinary people walk upon the earth, Liezi rode the wind—this spared him the toil of walking, yet without wind he could not proceed, so he still depended on something.

As for one who rides the inherent principle of Heaven and Earth, who harnesses the six qi—yin and yang, wind and rain, darkness and light—and roams the boundless beginning of all things without limit, such a one depends on nothing. This is the realm of progress without trace. To be without trace is to be called a Perfected One, a Spirit Man, a Sage. "No self," "no merit," "no name"—all describe the absence of trace. These three phrases are repeated to extol such a state further.

When Yao offered the world to Xu You, he said: "The sun and moon have risen, yet the torch still burns—is it not difficult for its light to compare? The seasonal rains have fallen, yet one still waters the fields—is it not laborious for its benefit to compare? If you stand forth, the world will be well-governed, yet I still speak of this—how lacking I feel! I beg you to take the world."

Xu You replied: "You govern the world, and the world is already well-governed. Yet I would still await you—would I do so for the sake of a name? A name is but the guest of reality; would I become a guest? The wren nests in the deep forest, yet needs only a single branch; the mole drinks from the river, yet takes only its fill. Return, my lord, and leave me to my uselessness. Though the cook does not prepare the feast, the invocator would not overstep his vessel and altar to take his place."

A torch is but a flame. Once the sun and moon shine, what need is there for a torch? Once the seasonal rains fall, what need is there for a watering pot? Yao meant that if Xu You stood forth, the world would govern itself, yet he insisted on offering it to him—he saw his own inadequacy, comparing himself to the torch and watering pot. The *invocator* is the master of ceremonies. To "govern the world" means to entrust the world to another. If a name does not arise from oneself but from others, it is external; when weighed against reality, reality is the master and name the guest. "I would not become a guest" means I would not lose myself to external things. The wren and the mole are Xu You’s self-comparisons, showing his contentment with little. *Crouching* means lying low; the *mole* is a burrowing rodent. "Return, my lord" means you should go back and rest, there is no need to visit me.

The cook and the invocator have different duties—just as I cannot abandon what I delight in to take your place, each must guard their own role. It is like the invocator refusing to overstep his vessel and altar to replace the cook in carving and cooking.

Jian Wu asked Lian Shu: "I heard Jie Yu’s words—they were vast but without substance, going on without return. I was alarmed by his speech, like the Milky Way stretching endlessly, so grand and distant, so far from human concerns."

Lian Shu said: "What did he say?"

Jian Wu replied: "On the distant Guye Mountain dwells a spirit-man. His skin is like ice and snow, his bearing as graceful as a maiden. He eats no grain, but drinks the wind and sips the dew. He rides the clouds and drives flying dragons, roaming beyond the four seas. His spirit is concentrated, so that things suffer no blight and the harvest ripens. I consider this mad and do not believe it."

Lian Shu said: "Indeed."

The blind have no part in the spectacle of patterns and colors; the deaf have no part in the sound of bells and drums. Yet is it only the body that may be deaf and blind? The mind, too, may suffer such afflictions. His words are like those spoken to a child.

This man, this power of his—it would embrace the myriad things and fuse them into one. Should the world seek to set itself aright, who would wear himself out taking the world as his concern? This man—nothing harms him. Though the great floods rise to the heavens, he does not drown; though great drought melts metal and stone, scorches earth and mountains, he does not burn.

His dust and chaff, his husks and refuse, would still suffice to mold a Yao or Shun. Who would trouble himself to take things as his concern?

Jian Wu and Lian Shu may not have truly encountered such a man—these are but allegories. Nor should one seek meaning in their names. Though one or two points may be explained, in truth, not all can be so readily accounted for.

"Without substance" means without reality. "Going on without return" means his grand words press ever forward without looking back. "Milky Way" refers to the celestial river. "The Milky Way stretching endlessly" means the river in the sky has no discernible beginning or end. *Jing* is pronounced as "path," *ting* as "courtyard." "So grand and distant" merely describes an immense and remote separation. "So grand" means "so very much so." "So far from human concerns" means his words are not what the world commonly knows.

The Miao Gu Ye is the name of a mountain, where ice and snow gleam with pristine purity. Those who cultivate themselves there preserve their wholeness, and the yang qi lies concealed and unmoving—thus they remain serene and still as ice and snow. Even today, practitioners of the qi-absorbing arts may achieve this.

"Graceful and delicate" describes their supple, lovely charm; "maiden" means a virgin. The four lines beginning with "their spirit whole, without eating" speak of their wondrous numinosity. Their essence and spirit congeal in stillness where they dwell, so that the hundred creatures naturally suffer no blight or pestilence, and the harvest ripens of itself. Such were Jie Yu’s words.

"Mad" is akin to "deceitful"—Jian Wu dismissed his words as falsehoods not to be trusted. "Indeed" means it is truly so, yet you stubbornly doubt and disbelieve. The display of patterns and colors, the sound of bells and drums—all see and hear them, yet the blind and deaf take no part, for this is a malady of the bodily form. Yet is this affliction confined to the body? The mind, too, may suffer it, for if the mind lacks perception, it is as deaf and blind—thus it fails to grasp these words and deems them lies.

"Thus" means "this"; *nü* is the same as "you." Earlier commentators all took *nü* here to mean "maiden," which distorts the meaning. Rather, it means: how could such words be within the grasp of the likes of you? Such beings, in their virtue and power, roam beyond the myriad things while the world governs itself—would they deign to wear themselves out with the affairs of ruling the world? This speaks of their non-doing that is yet non-not-doing.

"Qí" is the same as "qǐ," meaning to seek; "luàn" means governance. This speaks of the people of the world dividing themselves over governance—yet I practice non-doing, and they govern themselves. Why should I wear myself out? "Bìbì" expresses the idea of self-exertion.

"Nothing can harm them" means external things cannot disturb their fundamental mind. "Jī" means "to reach"; the vastness of water can ascend to the heavens, yet such a person does not drown. The most severe drought can melt metal and stone, wither mountains and parch the earth, yet they do not feel the heat—this speaks of their unobstructed self-possession in all circumstances.

"Dust, grime, chaff, and husks" refer to trivial remnants. This means that if such a person were to apply even their leftover efforts, they could accomplish the deeds of Yao and Shun—how could they deign to concern themselves with worldly affairs? "Things" here means affairs, and "to engage in affairs" means to take action. "Molding and casting" means to bring something to completion.

This single phrase aligns with what Guo Xiang called "unconventional." Yet the original intent of the text was to scorn the vulgar Confucians, so its language sometimes exceeds proper bounds—one should not judge it by this alone. As Li Taibai said: "The deeds of Yao and Shun are not so astonishing; none compare to Boyi and Shuqi in lofty purity." How is this different?

The people of Song took ceremonial caps to Yue, but the Yue, with their shorn hair and tattooed bodies, had no use for them. "Zhangfu" refers to caps. Since the Yue cut their hair, they did not wear caps. The people of Song brought these as goods to Yue, yet they found no market for them. Zhuangzi’s words here imply that his teachings are vast, while the people of this age possess only shallow vision—what use are such words? This means the world is unworthy of such discourse.

Yao governed the people of the world and brought order to the realm, yet when he went to see the Four Masters on Mount Miaogushe by the southern bank of the Fen River, he was suddenly lost to his own realm. This passage also conveys the idea that only by seeing the vast can one recognize one’s own limitations. Yao, the greatest ruler of ancient and modern times, upon seeing the Four Masters by the southern bank of the Fen River on Mount Miaogushe, was still struck with bewilderment—how much more so for others? "Lost to his realm" means he forgot his realm; "yǎorán" conveys a sense of vast emptiness.

The Four Masters have no names; some say they were Xu You, Nie Que, Wang Ni, and Pi Yi, while others claim the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states that Mount Miaogushe lies beyond the encircling sea, and Fenyang was Yao’s capital—thus, seeing the spirits of Miaogushe in his own capital was like seeing his own heart. The first was neither substance nor trace, the second neither non-substance nor trace, the third neither substance nor non-trace, and the fourth neither non-substance nor non-trace. Such interpretations grow increasingly convoluted and absurd—this is precisely Zhuangzi’s playful wit. It is like what people today call "headless talk," meant to lead scholars to ponder its context, yet commentators fall right into his trap. How can one read Zhuangzi this way? In truth, these are all allegories, generally meaning that people are confined by their own limited vision and do not realize it—only those with great insight can break free from such delusion.

Huizi said to Zhuangzi: "The King of Wei gave me seeds of a great gourd. I planted them, and they grew to hold five *dan*. When I used it to hold water, its weight was too great to lift; when I split it to make a ladle, it was too shallow and broad to hold anything. It was not that it wasn’t vast—it was simply useless. So I smashed it."

Zhuangzi said: "You are truly inept at putting great things to use. There was a man from Song skilled in making an ointment that prevented chapping. For generations, his family had made a living by washing silk floss. A traveler heard of this and offered a hundred gold pieces for the formula. The family gathered and deliberated: 'For generations, we’ve washed silk floss and earned only a few pieces of gold. Now, in a single morning, we can sell this skill for a hundred gold pieces—let us give it to him.' The traveler acquired it and presented it to the King of Wu. When Yue invaded, the King of Wu made him a general. In winter, they fought on the water, and he crushed the Yue forces, for which he was granted a fief. The ability to prevent chapping was the same, yet one man gained a fief while another remained washing silk floss—this was simply a matter of how it was used.

Now you have a gourd that holds five *dan*—why not consider making it into a great float to drift upon rivers and lakes, instead of fretting that it is too shallow and broad to hold anything? Clearly, your mind is still as obstructed as a clump of reeds." "Hù" refers to what can be made into a ladle; it is the seed of the bottle gourd. A single gourd so large that its seeds hold five *dan* could also hold five *dan* of water. "Firm" means heavy. "Piáo" is half a gourd; "hùluò" describes its broad, shallow appearance. "Pǒu" means to strike and break. "Does not chap" means that in winter, hands do not crack when using this ointment. "Píngpì" means washing; "kuàng" means silk floss. For generations, they had used this ointment to wash silk floss. "Zūn" is a floating gourd. By tying a gourd to one’s waist, one can float in water—hence the saying, "In midstream, a lost boat makes a gourd worth a thousand gold." Zhuangzi, having used the ointment parable to illustrate Huizi’s failure to recognize proper use, then said: "With such a great gourd, why not think of making it into a float for the river?" "Lǜ" means to consider. "Why not consider" means: why does your thinking not extend to this? "A mind like reeds" means a mind as obstructed as tangled reeds. The meaning of this passage is simply that one who sees only the small cannot use the great.

Huizi said to Zhuangzi: "I have a great tree—people call it the *chū*. Its trunk is gnarled and swollen, unfit for the carpenter’s line; its branches are twisted and crooked, unfit for the compass and square. It stands by the road, yet carpenters do not even glance at it. Now your words are vast but useless—everyone rejects them alike."

Zhuangzi said: "Have you never seen a wildcat? It crouches low, lying in wait for prey, leaping east and west, heedless of high or low—yet it is caught in a trap or snared in a net. Now consider the yak: as vast as a hanging cloud in the sky, great indeed—yet it cannot catch mice."

Now you have a great tree and fret over its uselessness—why not plant it in the land of Nothing-Whatsoever, the boundless wilds? There you may wander idly by its side, roam freely beneath its shade, lie down at ease beneath its boughs. No axe will fell it before its time, no thing will harm it. Useless? Where then is the hardship?

*Chū* is the name for a worthless tree. *Great trunk* refers to the tree’s body. *Gnarled and swollen* means knotted and lumpy. *Unfit for the carpenter’s line or compass and square* means it is of no use. *Standing by the road* means it is near the wayside. Here Huizi jestingly compares Zhuangzi’s grand words to this uselessness.

*Wildcat* refers to creatures like foxes. *Prey* means creatures that roam and play, which the wildcat lies in wait to devour. When it leaps and bounds, heedless of high or low, it is at its most nimble and daring—yet one day it is caught in a trap or net and killed. *Ji* means a mechanism; *jibi* refers to traps or snares.

The *lí-ox* is the yak, vast as a cloud hanging in the sky, great indeed—yet it cannot catch mice like a wildcat. This illustrates that things in the world, whether great or small, each have their own nature; one cannot dismiss all great things as useless.

The *land of Nothing-Whatsoever* and the *boundless wilds* refer to the realm of the Dao’s natural creation, where there is a place of joy. Those who toil in the human world may meet with fortune or misfortune, but if one soars high and far, delighting in the Dao, though of no use to the world, neither will misfortune or harm befall them—just as the saying goes: "No blade or saw touches them, nor do they hear of order or chaos."

Thus it is said: "No axe will fell it before its time, no thing will harm it. Useless? Where then is the hardship?" Huizi’s question and Zhuangzi’s answer are like the riddles people speak today. Later generations have spun countless words from this exchange, but its origin lies here.

*Beginning of the Second Scroll of the Oral Exegesis of the True Scripture of Southern Florescence*

Lin Xiyi of Yanzhai’s *Exegesis on the "On the Equality of Things" (First Part of the Inner Chapters)*

"On the Equality of Things" speaks of the discourses of men and things—akin to what we call "the many opinions." "Equality" means oneness, the desire to unify the many opinions into one. In the Warring States era, schools of thought diverged, each contending over right and wrong. Thus, Zhuangzi believed it better to forget both right and wrong and return to spontaneity—this is the intent behind the title.

The "Heavenly Pipe," "Earthly Pipe," and "Human Pipe" are metaphors drawn from sound. Nan Guo Ziqi, leaning against his armrest, sat with his gaze lifted to the sky, exhaling deeply. Lost in reverie, he seemed to have forgotten his counterpart. Yan Cheng Ziyou stood in attendance before him and asked, "What is this?" Can the body truly be made like withered wood, and the heart like dead ashes? The one who leans on the armrest today is not the same as the one who leaned on it before.

Zilou said: "Is this not well? Yet you ask." Today, I have lost my self—do you understand? To lean on the armrest is to rest upon it; *ta ran* describes a state of mindlessness; to forget one’s counterpart means that while others perceive a division between self and things, here it is forgotten. Withered wood signifies the absence of vitality; dead ashes, the stillness of the heart. "The one who leans on the armrest today" means that the Master’s present repose is not like that of others seen before. Where there is a self, there are things; to lose the self is to be without self, and without self, there are no things. "Do you understand?" asks whether you grasp this principle. *Wu* is the self, yet he does not say "I have lost my self" but "I have lost my *wu*," for even the slightest trace of private thought within the body creates a distinction between *wu* and self. The phrase "I have lost my *wu*" is exquisitely chosen. Dongshan said: "He is no longer me; I am now truly him." This is precisely the crux of the matter.

"You have heard the Human Pipe but not the Earthly Pipe; you have heard the Earthly Pipe but not the Heavenly Pipe."

Ziyou said: "May I ask the method?"

Ziqi replied: "The Great Clod exhales *qi*, and this is called wind. It arises of itself—when it does not act, all is still; when it acts, the myriad hollows roar in fury. Have you alone not heard the *liao liao* of the long wind? The towering forests, the great trees with trunks a hundred spans around, their hollows like noses, mouths, ears, crossbeams, rings, mortises, basins, or pools—some gushing, some whistling, some scolding, some inhaling, some shrieking, some wailing, some moaning, some biting. The first cry out *yu*, and those that follow echo *yong*. A gentle breeze brings a faint harmony; a whirlwind, a mighty one. When the fierce gale subsides, all the hollows fall silent—have you alone not seen the *tiao tiao* and *diao diao* of the swaying trees?"

Ziqi, perceiving from Ziyou’s question that he had some insight into the principle, sought to instruct him on the Heavenly Pipe and thus posed this query. "Method" here means the Way—he asks what this principle truly is. The "Great Clod" is heaven and earth; the wind between them arises as naturally as a man’s exhalation. "It arises of itself" means that when it does not act, all is still; "when it acts, the myriad hollows roar in fury" means that once it stirs, the entire world resounds. The "myriad hollows" are the hollows of the myriad trees; *liao liao* is the sound of the long wind. *Wei* (towering) is pronounced like *wei* (great), and *jia* (fine) like *cui* (emerald). The rising tone of *wei jia* describes the swaying of the forest. "A hundred spans" speaks to the trees’ girth—a span is the measure of two hands clasped together. Above, he speaks of the "myriad hollows"; here, he describes a single great tree, and the rest may be inferred—this is a matter of literary technique. The hollows of the great trees take different forms, each resembling something: crossbeams are the slanted timbers atop pillars; rings are like the circular rims of cups; basins are concave; pools, low-lying. All describe the shapes of the hollows. From "gushing" to "biting," he speaks of the sounds within the hollows. The sound of *yu* is light, while *yong* is heavy—the wind’s passage is like a lead voice singing *yu*, and those that follow echo *yong*, light and heavy in harmony.

A gentle breeze brings a faint harmony; a whirlwind, a mighty one. A fierce gale is a violent wind; when it ceases, the sounds that once filled the hollows vanish, and thus they are called empty. *Tiao tiao* and *diao diao* describe the trees swaying in the wind. The earlier "have you alone not heard" and the later "have you alone not seen" serve as the structural keys to this passage. Zhuangzi’s writing excels in many ways, and this passage is among its finest—a masterpiece within a masterpiece. Not only is it the finest in the entire book, but even among all the works of ancient and modern writers, none can match it. Poetry is said to be a painting in sound, for it depicts scenes that are otherwise indescribable. Yet when has a painting ever captured sound? From "gushing" to "biting," eight sounds are named, while *yu* and *yong* are the harmonizing echoes. The wind between heaven and earth is formless and invisible, its sound audible yet unseen—yet with his brush, he paints it into being. Without the immortal wisdom of Nanhua, how could such skill be attained? Every time I read this, I find myself dancing with joy, forgetting myself entirely.

This passage speaks of the Earthly Pipe, yet it leads into the Heavenly Pipe—such is the flow of the prose. Some commentators say that this describes the natural sounds of the Earthly Pipe, which are also the Heavenly Pipe, and indeed, if the wind does not arise from the workings of creation, from where else could it come? Yet in terms of the text’s structure, it speaks of the Earthly Pipe, and so we should take it as the Earthly Pipe, that we may discern its veins and sinews.

Ziyou said: "The Earthly Pipe is simply the myriad hollows; the Human Pipe, the bamboo flutes."

"May I inquire about the Heavenly Pipe?" Bamboo flutes, panpipes, and reed organs are of this kind. Yet the Human Pipe is not limited to bamboo instruments—metal, stone, silk, and gourd instruments all belong to it; this merely cites one example. Earlier, the Earthly Pipe was discussed, then the Heavenly Pipe, while the Human Pipe was dismissed in a single phrase—such is the structure of the prose. To read *Zhuangzi*, one must examine it with such care to find an entry point.

Master Qi said: "Though the myriad winds blow differently, each is made to follow its own nature. All take what they take for themselves—who then is the one that rouses them?" "Blowing the myriad" refers to all things that produce sound. It means that all sounding things are blown by the Creator, and the one who blows is the Creator, yet each is made to seem as if it arises of itself. The words "blows" and "makes" both belong to the Creator, while "takes for itself" means each takes from its own nature. "All take what they take for themselves" means that all things believe their sounds arise from their own power, unaware that it is the stirring of a single *qi*—who indeed is the one that moves it? When *qi* surges from within and becomes speech, the word "rouses" is used, akin to "rousing to flight," and both belong to the Creator.

"The great knowledge is broad and unhurried; the petty knowledge is narrow and calculating. The grand words blaze with brilliance; the petty words chatter endlessly." The "great knowledge" refers to those of superior understanding; "broad and unhurried" describes their ease and self-possession. "Petty knowledge" refers to those of small schemes; "narrow and calculating" describes their meticulous distinctions, counting stars and weighing grains. "Grand words" belong to those of towering presence; "blazing with brilliance" describes their radiance. Zhuangzi’s intent encompasses Yi, Zhou, Confucius, and Mencius in this single phrase. "Petty words" belong to those of limited vision; "chattering endlessly" describes their hesitation, looking back and forth. The doctrines of the Hundred Schools and the gossip of the marketplace all fall within this phrase. These four lines summarize the two kinds of people in the world: those who understand principles and manage affairs, and those who discuss learning and debate theories.

"In sleep, their spirits intertwine; when awake, their forms unfold. They engage in constant construction, daily battling with their hearts." Having expounded the four lines above, the text turns to the human body for illustration. "In sleep, their spirits intertwine" means that at night, the spirit gathers in the heart; "when awake, their forms unfold" means that by day, the four limbs are all in motion. These two lines encompass everyone from the emperor to the commoner. "Construction" means union; what responds externally is "engagement." It means that at night, one rests, but from dawn onward, in every encounter, there is response, and the heart is inwardly taxed as if in battle. This occurs day after day, hence "engaging in constant construction." "Daily battling with their hearts" echoes Mencius’s words about the deeds of the day and night, where there are those who undermine them. Mencius’s phrasing is gentle, but Zhuangzi’s language here is a hundredfold more vivid, startling the reader. Later Chan masters often expressed similar ideas in their words.

"Some are sluggish, some are cunning, some are secretive. In small fears, they tremble; in great fears, they dissolve." The "sluggish" are those who act in a dull, hesitant manner. Another kind speaks with hidden traps, hence "cunning." Yet another plans meticulously, leaving no thread unexamined, hence "secretive." All describe those in the world who respond to things with their hearts. Yet none attain freedom, all harboring anxiety and dread—the very "petty men ever sorrowful" of which Confucius spoke. Zhuangzi’s meaning, however, is that even Yao, Shun, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius were all "sorrowful." In minor matters, they tremble with fear, hence "small fears make them tremble"; in great matters, their worries run deep, their thoughts far-reaching, as if lost or doubtful, hence "great fears make them dissolve."

"Their outbursts are like the release of a crossbow trigger—this refers to their judgment of right and wrong. Their retention is like a sworn oath—this refers to their clinging to victory. Their decline is like autumn and winter—speaking of their daily erosion. What they are submerged in cannot be restored. Their weariness is like a sealed letter—speaking of their aging and decay. The heart near death cannot be revived." Their debates on right and wrong each have their own basis, like an archer aiming at a target, hence "their outbursts are like the release of a crossbow trigger," meaning no word is spoken in vain. "Judgment" means control. The desire to prevail remains unyielding, lingering in the breast like a sworn oath. Yet the heart, burdened by care and toil, is worn down day by day—this describes their inner suffering. Things flourish in spring and summer, wither in autumn and winter; the time of emaciation is thus likened to daily erosion. The three lines above are metaphors, while the three below convey meaning. The phrasing is such that once submerged in a course, it cannot be reversed, hence "what they are submerged in." The first "之" is an auxiliary particle; the second "之" means "to go," hence "cannot be restored." The latter "之" also means "to go," indicating it cannot be retrieved. Overwhelmed by desires, they are bound like a sealed letter, aging beyond salvation, hence "aging and decay." "Decay" means falling into a ravine. Such people, though their bodies live, their hearts are as if dead, hence "near death," meaning their minds are devoid of awareness. "Yang" means life; their hearts are already dead and cannot be revived.

The above depicts the worldly use of the heart. The twelve characters beginning with "joy and anger" further describe their outward appearance, showing how their inner state manifests externally. Some are joyful, some angry, some sorrowful, some delighted; at times they worry, at times they sigh, at times they shift their demeanor, never content, always desiring something else. "Dread" describes the look of anxiety and hesitation, unmoving...

"Yao" describes a state of languid indecision; "yi" means unrestrained indulgence; "qi" depicts an open, unconstrained demeanor, like striking a pose or setting an example. Though such people appear thus, they are in truth not free. Joy arises from emptiness, just as mushrooms form from the steaming of qi—these many kinds of people are all made by the Creator, blown into being by the myriad transformations. Yet when speaking of the Creator, one does not call it mere spontaneity. If people cannot hold fast to the Dao, they produce many grotesqueries, as if compelled by ghosts and spirits. Those who read *Zhuangzi* must examine this with great care.

Day and night alternate before us, yet none know where they first sprout. "Ah! Ah!"—from dawn to dusk, this is all we attain, and from this our lives arise. Without that, there is no "I"; without "I," there is nothing to grasp. This is nearly so, yet we know not what compels it. As if there were a true master, yet its traces cannot be discerned. It acts with certainty, yet its form is unseen; it has substance but no shape.

Day and night alternate before us—these are the comings and goings of the Creator. None know where it sprouts, for its origin is unseen. "Ah! Ah!"—like saying "so it is, so it is"—though the source of its sprouting remains unknown, between dawn and dusk, this is all we obtain. "This" refers to the Creator. This "this" carries great weight and should not be taken lightly. The "that" in "without that, there is no 'I'" refers back to this "this," meaning without the Creator, "I" could not be thus. Yet the Creator’s work only becomes manifest through the human body, hence "without 'I,' there is nothing to grasp." Though this explanation seems near and visible, what compels us to be thus used by the Creator remains unknown to us. Thus it is said: "This is nearly so, yet we know not what compels it."

The "true master" is the Creator. "As if there were" suggests it seems to exist but cannot be affirmed as truly real. "Zhen" refers to the ground of sprouting; "not discerning its zhen" means not knowing where it first sprouts. "Acts with certainty" refers to the visible workings of Heaven. "Already verified" means it is most real. The Creator’s actions are certain and present, yet its form is unseen—this is why we know not what compels it. "Has substance" means it is real, equivalent to "already verified"; "no shape" means its form is unseen. From "day and night alternate" onward, all describe the Creator’s workings, which unfold before us yet remain invisible. Through repeated and intricate turns of phrase, the words are urgent and the meaning profound, urging people to reflect deeply upon this.

The hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera—all are contained within us. To whom among them am I closest? Do you delight in all equally, or do you favor some? Are they all like servants and concubines? Are these servants and concubines insufficient to govern one another? Do they take turns as lord and subject? Is there a true ruler present?

Whether one grasps their nature or not, it neither benefits nor harms the real. The hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera comprise all that is within the human body. What follows further elucidates this point from the human form, and it is most extraordinary. "Contained" means complete and present—all these exist within the human body. "To whom among them am I closest?" asks: whom do I uniquely cherish? This "cherish" is profoundly placed. For example, if illness strikes the hand, causing suffering, then at that moment the hand becomes the body’s enemy—so it is with all six senses.

"Do you delight in all equally?" asks: among the six senses, do you take equal pleasure in all, or do you favor some? Moreover, in their functions within the body, which is noble and which base? When the head itches and the hand scratches, the hand serves the head; when the eyes wish to see afar and the feet walk, the feet serve the eyes. Those who serve are like servants and concubines—yet are they insufficient to govern one another?

Hands, feet, ears, eyes, nose, and tongue all serve one another in turn. The one served is the subject, the one serving is the lord. Sometimes the feet are used, sometimes the hands—thus they take turns as lord and subject. Since the lordship and subjecthood of the hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera cannot be fixed, then the heart, as the master of the body, must be the lord. Yet the heart cannot govern itself, for what governs it is the Creator—thus the Creator is the true ruler. Hence it is said: "Is there a true ruler present?" Though I seek thus to reach the truth, whether I grasp it or not, what is called the ruler neither gains nor loses in its reality. Thus it is said: "Whether one grasps their nature or not, it neither benefits nor harms the real."

Once we receive our completed form, we do not perish until its end. We clash and grind against things, our actions racing to their limit like a galloping horse, yet none can halt them—is this not lamentable? A lifetime of toil, yet no success is seen; wearily exhausted, we know not where we return—how can this not be sorrowful? People call this "not dying," but what good is it? The body transforms, the heart follows suit—can this not be called great sorrow?

Is human life inherently so deluded? Or am I alone deluded while others are not? Generally, the human form is not self-possessed but must be received from something else. Having received this form from the Creator, the Creator remains with us, not departing until this form is spent. Yet people cannot simply follow the Creator but are instead swept away by external things, sometimes resisting, sometimes yielding. Thus they act throughout their lives, like a colt passing a crack—unable to rest even for a moment. Hence it is said: "their actions race to their limit like a galloping horse, yet none can halt them."

Blades clashing—this is mutual opposition; scattering and yielding—this is being swept away and submerged. "Toiling all one’s life" speaks of self-inflicted suffering. "Never seeing one’s achievements come to fruition" speaks of futility. As the saying goes: "After gathering nectar from a hundred flowers to make honey, for whom is the sweetness, and who knows the bitterness?"—this is the same idea. Exhausted and worn, it further depicts the state of endless toil and hardship, not knowing where one is headed or when one may rest.

Human life labors thus of its own accord—even if one lives a hundred years, what good does it do? Hence it is said: "What good is not dying?" "The body’s transformation" refers to declining into gray hair, then from gray hair into old age. As the years grow ever more advanced, virtue grows ever more diminished—this is the body transforming while the heart does not. Within myself, lacking insight, I merely allow the heart to be enslaved by the body. When the body declines, the heart too grows weary—hence it is said: "the heart follows suit." "Muddled and confused"—this is to lack insight. Even those foolish and deluded should turn back and ask themselves: Is the human heart, by nature, so benighted and devoid of understanding? Am I alone benighted, while others are not?

This meaning suggests that Heaven, in giving birth to the multitudes, endows them with things and with principles. The people, holding fast to constancy, naturally incline toward excellent virtue. The heavenly principle has never been obscure—it is you who have obscured yourself with human desire, thus arriving at this state. How could those who understand the Dao be so muddled and confused? This is what is meant by "a golden needle scraping away the film"—it is meant to open your eyes.

Now, if one follows one’s "completed heart" and takes it as a teacher, who would lack such a teacher? Why must one wait for "knowledge of transformation" before the heart naturally possesses its own insights? Even the foolish share in this. To have judgments of right and wrong before the heart is fully formed is like setting out for Yue today yet claiming to have arrived yesterday. Thus, to take what is not as what is, to insist on what is not as what is—even if the divine Yu were to return, he could not comprehend it. What then can I do?

The "completed heart" is something everyone possesses. It is the heavenly principle, vast and undifferentiated, yet lacking in nothing. This means that in your life, you already possess a fully formed heavenly principle. If you could take this as your teacher, who would lack it? Not only the worthy possess it—the foolish possess it as well. "Knowledge of transformation" is a term for the ancient worthies, referring to their understanding of the principles of change. "The heart naturally possesses its own insights" means that the heart has its own perceptions. If this heart has not yet perceived the undifferentiated principle but forcibly establishes judgments of right and wrong, affirming what it affirms without knowing the principle’s original state, it is like setting out for Yue today yet claiming to have arrived yesterday. Is there any such principle in the world? This is to insist on what one does not know as if one knows it.

Thus, if one has no true insight yet insists on having it, even if one believes oneself to possess insight where there is none, not even the ancient sages returning could enlighten you—what then can others do for you? "Divine Yu" is Yu the Great, used here as a term for the ancient sages.

Words are not like the wind’s blowing. Speakers have their say, yet what they say remains unsettled. Is it truly speech? Or has there never been speech at all? Does it differ from the chirping of a fledgling? Can one distinguish it, or is there no distinction?

This chapter was originally composed to discuss the right and wrong of the *Discourse on Equalizing Things*. Earlier, it set forth the theory of the Three Pipes, stating that all sounds in heaven and earth arise from the Creator. It then expanded on this, explaining that the human body is entirely at the Creator’s disposal, unfolding and developing this idea until arriving at the "completed heart," where it pauses. From this point onward, it discusses judgments of right and wrong.

The wind through the hollows, compared to the sound of bamboo, blows in myriad ways—yet all are merely sound. Only when sound takes form does it become speech, and speech is not like the wind’s blowing. What is called speech is each person speaking their own meaning—hence it is said: "speakers have their say." These four words introduce the discussion of right and wrong. "What they say remains unsettled" means that though you may have these words, are they truly yours, or do they arise from the Creator? Hence it is said: "their words remain unsettled."

Is it truly your speech? Or have you never possessed these words, and it is the Creator who moves you to speak them? A fledgling is a bird newly hatched from the egg. Its chirping is without understanding, and your speech is likewise without self-awareness. If you believe it differs from the fledgling’s chirping, in reality it does not. Can you truly distinguish it from the fledgling’s sound, or is there no distinction? In truth, they are the same, and no distinction can be made.

Where does the Dao conceal itself to produce truth and falsehood? Where do words conceal themselves to produce right and wrong? Where does the Dao go that it ceases to exist? Where do words remain that they cannot be trusted?

The Dao is obscured by partial attainment; words are obscured by florid ornament. Thus arise the disputes of Confucians and Mohists, each affirming what the other denies and denying what the other affirms. If you would affirm what they deny and deny what they affirm, then nothing surpasses illumination.

Nothing exists that is not "that"; nothing exists that is not "this." From "that," one does not see; from self-knowledge, one knows. Thus it is said: "That emerges from this, and this likewise depends on that."

The Dao originally has no truth or falsehood—how then does it become obscured to produce truth and falsehood? Utterances originally have no right or wrong—how then do they become obscured to produce these disputes? As for "where it goes yet does not exist," it means that whether great or small, refined or coarse, the Dao is omnipresent. As for "where it remains yet cannot be trusted," it means that all affirmations and negations are permissible.

"Partial attainment" refers to a limited view, a one-sided perspective. Because of such partiality, the Dao becomes obscured and unclear. "Florid ornament" refers to self-aggrandizement in pursuit of fame and reputation. When partial views are adorned with such embellishment, the profound utterance is concealed. Thereafter begin the disputes between Confucians and Mohists, each affirming what the other denies and denying what the other affirms. What they deny, I affirm; what they affirm, I deny—how can any fixed standard be established? If one seeks to fix right and wrong, one must return to the natural principle of Heaven. "Illumination" is this natural principle. Thus it is said: "nothing surpasses illumination."

Nothing exists that is not "that"—if I affirm myself, I negate the other. Nothing exists that is not "this"—if I affirm myself, others negate me. From the other’s perspective, I do not act; discernment lies within me, and the wise know it for themselves. When self and other do not oppose each other, there is neither right nor wrong. Only through their opposition do right and wrong arise. Thus it is said: "That emerges from this, and this likewise depends on that." This is the doctrine of "that" and "this" arising simultaneously.

Yet as soon as something arises, it dies; as soon as it dies, it arises. As soon as something is permissible, it becomes impermissible; as soon as it is impermissible, it becomes permissible. Affirmation follows negation, and negation follows affirmation. Therefore the sage does not proceed by such means but illuminates all through Heaven—this too is "following affirmation."

The existence of "that" and "this" is no different from the doctrine of simultaneous arising. Here, the term "simultaneous arising" is introduced as an analogy. For life necessarily entails death, and the two cannot be separated. To speak only of life without death is to see only one side. Though you may see only one side, in principle they cannot be separated. Just as life necessarily entails death, and death necessarily entails life, so too does the permissible necessarily entail the impermissible, and the impermissible the permissible. How can they be divided? Once you recognize that their separation is impossible, it is better to affirm what is affirmed and negate what is negated. The sages of old did not rely on partial views but illuminated all through the principle of Heaven—this is simply "following affirmation." The earlier statement about "affirmation following negation" is here abbreviated to "following affirmation."

"This" is also "that," and "that" is also "this." "That" has its own right and wrong, and "this" has its own right and wrong. Is there truly a "that" and "this"? Or is there truly no "that" and "this"? When "that" and "this" find no counterpart, this is called the pivot of the Dao. Once the pivot is grasped at the center of the circle, it can respond endlessly. Affirmation is one endless cycle, and negation is another. Thus it is said: "nothing surpasses illumination."

If we argue over right and wrong, their doctrines are one right and wrong, and our doctrines are another right and wrong—how then do we differ? Though you divide things into self and other, in reality they cannot be divided. Thus it is said: "Is there truly a 'that' and 'this'? Or is there truly no 'that' and 'this'?"—meaning that both self and other are nonexistent. "Counterpart" means opposition. If "that" and "this" do not stand in opposition but are blended into one, this is the pivot of the Dao. The center of a ring is necessarily empty. When I grasp the pivot of the Dao, I am like the center of a ring—without beginning or end, infinite. "Affirmation is one endless cycle, and negation is another" means following the natural course. This is the natural principle of Heaven. Thus it is said: "nothing surpasses illumination," echoing the earlier statement to conclude this passage.

To use a finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger is not as good as using a non-finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger. To use a horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse. Heaven and Earth are one finger; the myriad things are one horse.

"A finger" refers to a finger of the hand. If I take my finger to be a finger, then I take another’s finger to be not a finger. Yet those who do not take it as a finger also take my finger to be not a finger. If I merely negate the other without considering their perspective, it is better to reflect on how they negate me. When self and other oppose each other, right and wrong cannot be fixed.

"A horse" refers to the counting rods used in games of chance. See the *Record of Rites*, "Touhu" chapter. The number of rods varies, and the disputes of gamblers are likewise divided. If we apply this principle, then Heaven’s duty to cover and Earth’s duty to bear could also be negated from a partial perspective. The myriad things differ—some fly, some walk, some move, some are rooted—just as the counting rods differ, and they too could be negated from a partial perspective. This illustrates that in the world there is no right or wrong; it is only because of self and other that right and wrong never cease. Can Heaven and Earth also be divided into self and other? This all serves to illustrate that the discourse on things cannot but be equalized.

What is permissible is permissible, what is impermissible is impermissible. The Dao is realized through its enactment, and things are affirmed through their designation. Why are they so? They are so because they are so. Why are they not so? They are not so because they are not so. Things inherently possess what they affirm, things inherently possess what they permit—nothing is not affirmed, nothing is not permitted. What is permissible is permitted, what is impermissible is not permitted. Thus it is said: what is permissible is permissible, what is impermissible is impermissible.

The Dao has no refinement or coarseness; when enacted, it is realized—all is natural. To designate and affirm is simply to speak of what is so. What do I affirm? I affirm by following what is affirmed. What do I not affirm? I do not affirm by following what is not affirmed. Things inherently possess what they affirm—*gu* (inherently) means "originally." This means that each thing originally possesses its own affirmation. Thus it is said: inherently possessing what they affirm, inherently possessing what they permit. Since they possess what they affirm and what they permit, then all things are likewise. Thus it is said: nothing is not affirmed, nothing is not permitted.

Therefore, consider the rafter and the pillar, the leper and Xi Shi, the vast and the cramped, the deceptive and the constant, the cunning and the straightforward, the monstrous and the auspicious—all are different. The rafter is horizontal, the pillar vertical; the leper is ugly, Xi Shi beautiful. The vast differs from the cramped, the deceptive from the constant, the cunning from the straightforward, the monstrous from the auspicious—yet all are distinct. Viewed through the Dao, the horizontal and vertical each serve their purpose, the beautiful and ugly each fulfill their nature, and all can be harmonized into one. This means all return to the Creator.

Their division is their completion, their completion is their destruction. All things are neither completed nor destroyed, but return to unity. Completion and destruction are opposed in things. Yet without destruction, there is no completion; without completion, there is no destruction. For example, a tree in the mountains is felled and used—this is destruction; but when used to build a house, it becomes a completed thing. Or consider medicine: it is blown upon and chewed—this is division; but when combined and harmonized, it becomes a remedy. A bow is completed with sinew and horn; in the bow, it is completion, but in the sinew and horn, it is destruction. If Qin had not fallen, Han would not have risen; Han’s completion is Qin’s destruction. Viewed thus, there is originally no completion, nor is there destruction. Thus it is said: they return to unity.

Only the enlightened know this unity. Therefore, they do not employ [partial views] but lodge them in the ordinary. The ordinary is use; use is harmony; harmony is attainment—attaining it is near perfection. Following this, ceasing and yet not knowing why it is so—this is the Dao.

Only those who comprehend the Dao know that this principle is one. Thus, they discard their affirmations, do not employ them, and lodge them in the ordinary. Using the constant, they harmonize all applications; in harmony, they naturally attain. Thus it is said: the ordinary is use, use is harmony, harmony is attainment—attaining it is near perfection. *Ji* (near) means "exhaustive." There is nothing more to this than following what is so and eliminating disputes over right and wrong. Only when one no longer knows why yet follows the natural—this is called the Dao.

The following phrase connects the two instances of *yi* (already), a playful flourish in the text.

To exhaust one’s spirit in forcing unity without recognizing their sameness—this is called "morning three." What is "morning three"? It is said: the Lord of Zhu distributed chestnuts, saying "three in the morning and four in the evening." The monkeys were all enraged. He then said, "Very well, four in the morning and three in the evening." The monkeys were all pleased. The names and realities had not changed, yet joy and anger were employed—this too follows what is so.

Therefore, the sage harmonizes right and wrong and rests in the equality of Heaven, which is called "walking two paths." *Shenming* (spirit) refers to the mind. To labor the mind in clinging to partial views, forcing right and wrong without recognizing the original unity of principle—this is called "morning three." This is another example of setting up a metaphor, following the same structure as "fang sheng" (mutual arising).

Chestnuts are mountain chestnuts, also called acorns. The names "three" and "four" differ, but the total remains seven. The names and realities do not change, yet shifting morning and evening alters the monkeys’ joy and anger. This illustrates that while the names of right and wrong differ, the reality of principle is the same. If one can follow what is so, the world will naturally have no disputes.

Hong Yechu said: *Liezi* surpasses *Zhuangzi*. Though both books share this metaphor, merely expanding the word count reveals that *Liezi* cannot surpass *Zhuangzi*. To harmonize right and wrong is to reconcile them into one. *Tian jun* (equality of Heaven) means impartiality without self and other. *Liang xing* (walking two paths) means allowing right and wrong to proceed side by side.

The knowledge of the ancients reached its utmost. How far did it reach? Some held that there had never yet been things—this is the utmost, the exhaustion, beyond which nothing can be added. Next were those who held that things existed but had never yet been bounded. Next were those who held that boundaries existed but right and wrong had never yet arisen. The manifestation of right and wrong is the diminishment of the Dao. The diminishment of the Dao is the formation of attachment. Is there truly completion and diminishment? Or is there truly no completion and diminishment?

Those who held that there had never yet been things refer to the state before the Supreme Ultimate. "The ancients" refers to those who understood the Dao. Viewed from the beginning before things existed, the principles of the world are exhausted. Next, to hold that things exist is to speak of the Supreme Ultimate emerging from the Limitless. From things emerging with boundaries, the Supreme Ultimate divides into the Two Modes. Though the Two Modes differ—one covering, one bearing—they each follow their principle. How could there be right and wrong? Right and wrong arise from the selfishness of the human mind. Once selfishness is manifest, the natural Dao is diminished.

Once the Dao is diminished, there arise likes and dislikes—what is love in me becomes aversion in others, which is what the Buddhists call the "river of attachment." To impair the Dao and drown in love is but the selfishness of the human mind. Yet viewed from the perspective of the Creator, how could there ever be completion or diminishment? Thus it is said: Is there truly completion and diminishment? Or is there truly no completion and diminishment? This speaks to how all disputes over right and wrong in the human world ultimately return to emptiness.

Though this passage begins with the origins of Heaven and Earth, one who grasps this principle sees it manifest before their very eyes. For instance, before a single thought arises, it is the time "before things ever existed." Once this thought arises, it is "the existence of things." From this thought comes the distinction between self and other, which is "the emergence of boundaries." From self and other arise likes and dislikes, joy and anger, sorrow and delight—this is the rise of right and wrong. If one cannot reflect back to the time before thoughts arose, one sees only the turmoil within the breast, which is the Dao diminished and attachment formed. Yet when this thought passes, all returns to tranquility, revealing that there was never truly completion or diminishment.

Though Zhuangzi’s words may seem remote, if one can embody them thus, they become matters of immediate and personal relevance. There is completion and diminishment—hence Zhaoshi’s playing of the zither. There is no completion and diminishment—hence Zhaoshi’s not playing of the zither. Zhaowen’s playing of the zither, Master Kuang’s striking of the clappers, and Hui’s leaning upon the elm—these three men’s skills were all at their peak. Thus their deeds are recorded in their later years, for their devotion set them apart from others. Their devotion sought to make their skills known, yet what they sought to clarify was not inherently clear, so they ended in the obscurity of "hard and white." And Zhaowen’s son, in turn, carried on his father’s art to the end, yet achieved nothing in his lifetime. Could this be called completion? Though I, too, may be said to have achieved, can this truly be called completion?

Things and self share no completion. Thus the dazzling confusion of doubt is what the sage seeks to resolve. To refrain from use and lodge it in the ordinary—this is called "illumination through non-action." Having expounded the principle of completion and diminishment, he then uses the zither as a metaphor, which is most apt. Consider a zither here: if one plays it, a piece of music has a beginning and an end, but this beginning and end arise only after playing. If one does not play, how could there be beginning or end? Likewise, if a single thought does not arise, there is no distinction between self and other.

Zhao was a surname; Wen was the given name of an ancient master of the zither. Master Kuang was a court musician. *Ce* refers to the implement used to strike musical instruments—today, a horsewhip is also called a *ce*. In the *Zuozhuan*, Rao Chao gifts one as a *ce*, and Yang Tan strikes the West Gate with one—both are horsewhips. *Zhi* means "to hold," and "to strike" is called *zhi*; these two characters likely existed in ancient speech. "Master Kuang striking the clappers" thus means Master Kuang playing the percussion instrument. *Ju wu* means leaning upon an elm as if it were a table, hence "leaning upon the elm." Following the mention of zither-playing, he then brings up the other two, saying that the three men’s skills were all refined. *Ji* means "exhaustion," indicating that their wisdom in these arts was fully realized. Their skills were so masterful that they gained great renown in the world, hence "all at their peak."

*Zai* means "to engage in," and *monian* means "later years"—referring to dedicating oneself to these pursuits until the end of life. The three men’s devotion set them apart from others in the world, hence "their devotion set them apart from others." Having devoted themselves thus, they sought to display their skills to others, hence "their devotion sought to make their skills known." Though they sought to clarify, those who listened were not inherently enlightened, so they forced understanding upon them, hence "what they sought to clarify was not inherently clear." Like Huizi’s stubborn arguments, which only led to his own confusion, they ended their lives thus. "Hard and white" originally referred to Gongsun Long’s paradox, but Zhuangzi attributes it to Huizi, merely borrowing the name of the "hard and white" debate. *Mei* means "self-delusion."

Above, he spoke of the three men, but here he concludes with Huizi’s arguments—this is a matter of literary technique. "Hard and white," according to commentators, refers to the debates over "hard stone" and "white horse." For example, if something is hard, it is stone, and one need not say "hard"; if something is white, it is a horse, and one need not say "white"—much like the paradox of "yellow horse" and "black ox." The *Records of the Grand Historian*’s commentary on Su Qin’s biography also states that when Longquan water was used to quench swords, they became hard and sharp, giving rise to the "hard and white" debate: yellow represents hardness, white represents sharpness. The Qi debaters countered: white represents lack of hardness, yellow represents lack of sharpness. Though the two arguments differ, both are the work of sophists.

Zhaowen spent his life playing the zither, and his son, in turn, carried on his father’s legacy, also spending his life in this pursuit. *Lun* means "legacy." Above, he spoke of Huizi, and in the next line, he concludes with Zhaowen’s son—this is where the brush dances. "Achieved nothing in his lifetime" means that only he himself could master it, and he could not teach others, hence "no completion." If all things in the world could be resolved merely by relying on one’s abilities, then what I can do in the present could also be called resolution. But if what I do in the present is not truly resolution, then neither I nor anyone in the world can be said to have achieved resolution. *Cheng* here means "resolution."

Though these two lines conclude the discussion of the three men’s skills, their meaning is vast, for the three men’s skills serve as metaphors for the disputes over right and wrong in the world—they are not merely about the three men. *Huayi* means "indistinct and unclear." Confusion that breeds doubt appears bright but is not truly illuminating. *Yao* means "brightness." The sage’s mind does not cling to traces, so what it perceives is as if present, as if absent. To refrain from use and lodge it in the ordinary—this is called "illumination."

The term *tu* means "desire," indicating that what the sage desires is precisely this. Thus, to set aside "this" without employing it and lodge it in the ordinary—this is called "illumination."

From *"Since things are never without their opposites"* down to *"not one, not inexhaustible,"* the meaning of "illumination" is explained. From *"Using a finger to illustrate a finger"* down to *"one attains it and nearly grasps it,"* the meaning of *"relying on this"* is further clarified. Then, returning directly to this point, the text concludes with *"this is called 'illumination,'"* its structure rising and falling, shifting and transforming, yet its guiding principles remain distinct. I have often said that the *Qi Wu Lun* is but a single continuous text—examining its phrasing closely reveals its vital pulse.

Now, suppose I make a statement here: I do not know whether it belongs to the same category as "this" or not. Whether it belongs or does not belong, if both are considered as belonging to the same category, then it differs in no way from that. This passage arises from the phrase *"not employing this,"* hence the question: *"Does it belong to the same category as this, or not?"* This is the vital pulse of its phrasing. Earlier, it said, *"Words are not the blowing of the wind,"* and now, shifting its opening, it exclaims, *"Now, suppose I make a statement here"*—this, too, is the vital pulse connecting its beginning and end.

When the similar and the dissimilar are viewed from each other’s perspective, one sees that similarity and dissimilarity are themselves alike. The meaning is this: if you regard it as me and me as it, you will see that I and it are the same. Thus, it says, *"it differs in no way from that"*—this is the meaning of *"using a finger to illustrate a finger"* and *"using a horse to illustrate a horse."*

Yet, let me try to speak of it. There is a beginning; there is that which precedes the beginning; there is that which precedes even that which precedes the beginning. There is being; there is non-being; there is that which precedes non-being; there is that which precedes even that which precedes non-being. Suddenly, there is being and non-being, yet I do not know which of the two—being or non-being—is truly being or non-being. Now, I have already made a statement, yet I do not know whether what I have called it is truly a statement or not.

Just as Zhuangzi’s prose takes a turn at *"Yet,"* his words are marvelous. His meaning is this: though there is neither right nor wrong, let us still speak of it—hence, *"let me try to speak of it."* *"Beginning"* refers to the Supreme Ultimate; *"that which precedes the beginning"* refers to the Limitless; *"that which precedes even that which precedes the beginning"* is yet another layer beyond the Limitless. *"There is being"* refers to the arising of things, which must begin from non-being. Thus, *"there is non-being"*—and above *"non-being"* is *"that which precedes non-being,"* another layer beyond the Limitless. The *Liezi* speaks of the Great Simplicity, the Great Pristine, and the Great Beginning—this is the same idea. Originally, there was no being; not only was there no being, there was not even non-being. Suddenly, there was non-being, and from it arose being. Tracing this back reveals the meaning: in the beginning, there was originally nothing. Only with the emergence of the self did things and the self arise; only with things and the self did right and wrong appear. The general idea is no more than this, yet its exposition is truly lofty and wondrous.

Here, it should say, *"Suddenly, there is being,"* but instead, it says, *"Suddenly, there is being and non-being"*—this is where the brushwork attains its subtlety. Though this *"non-being"* has arisen, can it truly be called non-being? Thus, it says, *"I do not know which of the two—being or non-being—is truly being or non-being."* Though this *"non-being"* remains unknowable, once it is called *"non-being,"* it has already acquired the name of being and non-being. Thus, it says, *"Now, I have already made a statement."* Yet, though I have spoken these words—*"statement"* here meaning *"words"*—I do not know whether these words can truly be called being or non-being. This is akin to the passage on the fledgling’s cry.

The sage judges but does not debate. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* records the intentions of the former kings who ordered the world—the sage debates but does not argue. Thus, where there is division, there is also non-division; where there is argument, there is also non-argument. One asks: Why? The sage cherishes it within, while the multitude debates it to display to one another. Thus, it says: *"Where there is argument, there is also non-perception."*

Having already spoken of self and other, right and wrong, these few lines introduce yet another layer of meaning, revealing the boundless subtlety and freedom within this elder’s mind. Beyond the six directions lies the realm beyond heaven and earth—this is what is meant by *"preserving without discussing,"* akin to the Buddhist notion of the four directions and above and below being beyond conception. Within the six directions lies the realm of the cosmos, where countless principles exist. The sage does not refrain from speaking of them, yet he does not establish rigid debates to impose understanding upon the world. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* is the name of a historical record—this line refers to the fact that wherever there is ruler and subject, high and low, all that appears in the annals reflects the intentions of the former kings in ordering the world. How could the sage fail to establish such debates? Yet when has he ever contended with the world over right and wrong? For the principles of the world, silence is the highest speech; the moment one engages in division and debate, it reveals that one’s own understanding is not yet thorough. Thus, it says: *"Where there is division, there is also non-division; where there is argument, there is also non-argument."*

Here, it once more raises the question: *"Why?"* *"Cherishing it within"* means *"withdrawing and concealing in secrecy."* The sage, in this regard, rolls it up and cherishes it within, while the multitude, in this regard, must debate and clarify it to boast and display to one another. The moment there is division and debate, it is a sign of lacking insight—thus, it says, *"there is also non-perception."*

The great Dao is not named; great debate does not speak; great benevolence is not benevolent; great integrity is not modest; great courage is not aggressive. When the Dao is made manifest, it is no longer the Dao; when words are debated, they fall short; when benevolence is constant, it does not achieve; when integrity is pure, it is not trustworthy; when courage is aggressive, it does not succeed. These five, though round, nearly tend toward the square.

Thus, to know where to halt in what one does not know—this is perfection. Who understands the debate of no-words, the Dao of no-Dao? If one can grasp this, it is called the Celestial Treasury. Pour into it without filling, draw from it without exhausting, yet know not whence it comes—this is called "preserving the light."

That which has an opposite is called a name, but the great Dao has no opposite. Within wordlessness lies the most profound speech, hence it is said, "great debate does not speak." Only when no trace of benevolence remains does it become great benevolence.

"Modesty" (嗛) means fullness; monkeys hide things by stuffing their cheeks. If one takes contentment as integrity, there arises the intent of self-satisfaction. The *Guoyu* states: "The virtue of self-restraint is insufficient to achieve greatness," for it remains small. Thus, whether one is modest for fear of others knowing or for fear of others not knowing, neither attains great integrity.

"Not aggressive" (不忮) means no trace of courage is seen in its use. Having expounded these five phrases, the text further elucidates them in turn.

"Manifest" (昭) means clarity; the Dao cannot be designated by name. If it is made manifest and named, it is no longer the Dao—hence it is said, "to give form to the Dao through debate is to reveal where one’s insight falls short." "Constant" (常) refers to visible progress; if there are visible traces, it is not the full realization of benevolence. Integrity that reaches the point of self-purification lacks sincerity, for "purity" (清) implies the intent of self-cleansing. "Trustworthiness" (信) means authenticity. Courage that manifests in aggression must lose its true courage.

The term "round" (圆) signifies wholeness, indicating that the five qualities above are all complete and perfect, for their essence is undifferentiated and whole. If the slightest trace appears, they verge upon the angularity of square things—meaning they acquire edges and corners.

"Approaching" (几) means drawing near. The word "toward" (向) shares the same sense as "in" (於). The true knowledge of all under heaven must culminate in knowing as not-knowing, and there it finds its ultimate limit. This "not-knowing knowledge" is the debate that transcends words, the Way that transcends the Dao. If one can grasp this, one may perceive where the principles of heaven converge. Thus it is said: "This is called the Heavenly Treasury." The Heavenly Treasury is the convergence of heavenly principle. Where heavenly principle converges, one may seek to augment it yet cannot add to it—hence it is said, "Pour into it and it is not filled." One may seek to diminish it yet cannot take from it—hence it is said, "Draw from it and it is not depleted." The subtlety of the supreme principle knows no end and no beginning, thus it is said, "One knows not whence it comes."

"Preserved radiance" (葆光) is the glow of elusive doubt. "Preserved" (葆) means concealed. Concealing one’s light without revealing it is called "preserved radiance." Thus, in ancient times, Yao asked Shun: "I wish to attack Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao, yet when I sit facing south, I feel unsettled. What is the reason?" Shun replied: "Those three rulers still dwell among the brambles and mugwort. Why should you feel unsettled?" The word "thus" (故) at the beginning of the next passage serves to connect it to the foregoing as supporting evidence. The matter of Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao is not recorded in the classics—it is merely an allegory. "Unsettled" means displeased. "Among the brambles and mugwort" is a metaphor for being obscured by worldly desires and unaware of heaven and earth. It means that those three states, self-obscured by desire, have not yet turned toward transformation, and if I feel displeasure at this, then self and other are set in opposition. The tale of the ten suns appearing together is also found in the *Huainanzi*. This is likely a parable of Zhuangzi’s, which the *Huainanzi* later embellished. It says that the sun illuminates all things without exception—how much more should my virtue, surpassing the sun, be able to embrace these three rulers? This meaning alludes to the opposition of self and other, right and wrong, and why the sage truly does not debate: he illuminates all with heaven. The parable of the ten suns is thus akin to the analogy of "illuminating with clarity."

Nie Que asked Wang Ni: "Do you know what things share in common as right?" Wang Ni replied: "How would I know?" "Do you know what you do not know?" "How would I know?" "Then do things lack knowledge?" "How would I know?" "Nevertheless, let me try to speak of it. How do I know that what I call knowing is not not-knowing? How do I know that what I call not-knowing is not knowing?" This passage arises from the earlier theme of "knowing to halt at what one does not know," and is drawn from the preceding discussion of "right." Thus the entire essay is but a single continuous text. Nie Que’s question about "what is shared as right" and Wang Ni’s response of "not knowing" both exemplify knowing to halt at what one does not know. Yet the invention of such names and the spirited elaboration are what make this the work of Zhuangzi. Though he says, "How would I know?" he then adds, "Nevertheless, let me try to speak of it"—these are the subtle turns of his art. "What I call knowing is not not-knowing; what I call not-knowing is not knowing"—these two lines brilliantly develop the idea of knowing to halt at what one does not know. His meaning is that not-knowing is true knowledge. "Now, let me put this question to you."

People who sleep in dampness suffer from lower back pain and partial paralysis—are eels any different? Those who dwell in trees are filled with dread and trembling—are gibbons any different? Which of these three knows the proper dwelling? People eat the flesh of livestock, deer feed on grass, centipedes relish snakes, and owls and crows delight in mice—of these four, which knows the true flavor? Gibbons mate with *bianju* apes, elk couple with deer, and loaches swim with fish. Mao Qiang and Lady Li are considered beauties by humans, yet fish plunge deep at the sight of them, birds take flight, and deer bolt away—of these four, which knows the true countenance of the world?

From my perspective, the distinctions of benevolence and righteousness, the paths of right and wrong, are but a tangled, chaotic snarl. How could I discern their distinctions?

Now, the question I once posed to you was but an opening remark. Loaches are at ease in water, gibbons in trees—how could humans dwell there? Each is content in what it finds contentment, yet none can bear what it finds unbearable. Thus, none of the three truly knows the proper dwelling. How, then, can humans claim superiority over gibbons or loaches?

*Chu* refers to the food of plants and trees; *huan*, to the taste of meat. *Jian* is grass; *dai*, snakes. Deer feed on grass, centipedes on snakes, owls and crows on mice, while humans eat the flesh of livestock. Their preferences for what is sweet and savory all differ—so which of the four knows the true flavor? *Bianju* is a kind of ape. Gibbons mate with apes, elk with deer (both being of the same kind), and loaches with fish (not two separate creatures). Following this analogy of male and female, the text turns to Mao Qiang and Lady Li, saying: those who take pleasure in beauty—how do they differ from birds and fish? My view of apes and deer is no different from theirs of me. Yet of these four, which knows the true countenance of the world?

*Jue* means fierce; *zhou*, swift. These three sections all serve as metaphors for the distinctions between right and wrong, self and other. Thus, the passage concludes: from my perspective, the divisions of benevolence and righteousness, the debates over right and wrong, are but a confused and muddled tangle—just like the differing perceptions of dwelling, flavor, and beauty. How, then, could one possibly distinguish them?

Nie Que said: "If you do not know benefit and harm, does the Perfected Person likewise not know benefit and harm?"
Wang Ni replied: "The Perfected Person is divine. Though great marshes burn, they cannot be made hot; though the Milky Way freezes, they cannot be made cold; though thunder splits mountains and winds shake the seas, they cannot be startled. Such a one rides the clouds and qi, mounts the sun and moon, and roams beyond the four seas. Life and death bring no change to them—how much less the distinctions of benefit and harm?"

Wang Ni is the Perfected Person. "Divine" describes one who subtly permeates the myriad things without leaving a trace. Unaffected by heat, cold, or shock, their mind wanders in the beginning of the formless. Even the great matter of life and death does not move their heart—how much less benefit, harm, right, or wrong? This line serves as a plain and solid conclusion.

Ju Quezi asked Chang Wuzi: "I have heard from the Master that the sage does not engage in worldly affairs, does not pursue profit, does not avoid harm, does not delight in seeking, does not follow the Dao, speaks without speaking, and speaks as though not speaking—and thus roams beyond the dust and grime. The Master deemed these reckless words, but I consider them the conduct of the wondrous Dao. What do you think?"

Chang Wuzi replied: "These are words that even the Yellow Emperor would strain to comprehend—how could Confucius possibly understand them?"

This passage, following the discussion of the Perfected Person, introduces the question of the sage, further critiquing the scholars of the Confucian school. "Worldly affairs" refers to matters one does not take to heart. To approach or avoid is to acknowledge benefit and harm—if one does not know benefit and harm, how could there be approach or avoidance? If things seek me or I am drawn to them, I do not take it as delight. "Does not follow the Dao" means leaving no trace of conduct. "Speaks without speaking" is speech that is not speech; "speaks as though not speaking" is speech that is no speech.

"Reckless" means insubstantial. "The Master" refers to Confucius. Ju Quezi says: I spoke of the sage’s conduct to the Master, who deemed it insubstantial, but I consider it the wondrous Dao—what do you think? "You" here refers to Chang Wuzi.

"Strain to comprehend" means to make clear. It is said that only the Yellow Emperor could understand such words after careful listening. "You are far too hasty in your judgment—seeing an egg and demanding a rooster’s crow at dawn, seeing a slingshot and craving roasted owl. I have spoken to you idly—why not listen idly in return? To ride beside the sun and moon, to embrace the cosmos, to let one’s lips meet, to set aside confusion and resentment, and to serve as companions in mutual reverence—this is the way.

The common people toil endlessly, while the sage appears foolish and dull. They harmonize the myriad ages into a single purity, for all things are thus, and this is how they are enfolded within one another.

"You are far too hasty in your judgment" means that your words are as they are, yet you prematurely deem them the conduct of the wondrous Dao—this is seeing little and thinking much of oneself. It is like seeking a rooster’s crow at dawn before the hour of *mao*, or craving roasted owl before the bird is even struck by the slingshot—this is the metaphor of hasty judgment.

*Shiye* refers to a rooster’s crow at the proper hour. I have idly spoken to you—listen idly in return, and see how it is. The word "how" here is striking.

"To ride beside the sun and moon" means to be in their company; "to embrace the cosmos" means to hold it within one’s arms.

"Seam," meaning "to join," speaks of a state of perfect fusion without gap or fissure—this is how the ultimate principle merges into oneness.

"Slippery" describes a rushing, turbid flow; "muddled" means benighted and confused. The rushing, muddled world of men, with its hierarchies of deference, is set aside and left unspoken. Scholars defer to grand officers, grand officers treat scholars as underlings; grand officers defer to ministers, and ministers treat grand officers as underlings. Extend this upward, and all are underlings to one another, yet they still fabricate distinctions of high and low. The multitude, deluded by the world, toil endlessly in their labors. The sage, knowing through unknowing, remains in a state of undifferentiated simplicity—like one foolish and dull. "Foolish and dull" describes the appearance of utter ignorance.

"To unite" means to converge; when one surveys the convergence of ten thousand ages, only this single principle remains, with no admixture or interruption—thus it is called "a single, pure accomplishment." "All things are thus" means that each thing is as it is in its own way. Every person harbors private intentions, so that between heaven and earth, from ancient times to the present, countless instances of "this is so" accumulate—hence the saying: "they enfold one another through 'this is so.'" "To enfold one another" is like saying "to pile up and press upon one another."

How do I know that delight in life is not a delusion? How do I know that aversion to death is not like one who has lost his way in weakness and does not know the way home?

Lady Li was the daughter of the border warden of Ai. When the state of Jin first obtained her, she wept until her tears soaked her collar. Yet once she arrived at the king’s palace, sharing his royal couch and feasting on fine meats, she came to regret her earlier tears.

How do I know that those who die do not regret their initial longing for life? One who dreams of drinking wine may wake weeping, while one who dreams of weeping may wake to go hunting. In the midst of a dream, one does not know it is a dream—even within the dream, one may interpret it, only to awaken and realize it was all a dream. And only after the great awakening does one know that this was the great dream. Yet fools believe themselves awake, priding themselves on their discernment: "This one is a lord, that one a herdsman!" How rigid is Confucius! You and I are both dreaming. When I say you are dreaming, I too am dreaming—such words are called "perverse consolation."

Were a great sage to arise ten thousand generations hence and grasp this understanding, it would be as if we had met in a single morning or evening. The preceding discussion arose from the principle of "enfolding one another through 'this is so,'" which further clarifies the earlier statement that "life and death undergo no change."

"To lose one’s way" means to depart from one’s homeland; "weakness and loss" refers to one who leaves home in youth. To linger long in a foreign land and forget one’s native country—this is akin to delighting in life and dreading death. Lady Li was a consort of Duke Xian of Jin, captured from the state of Lirong, hence called "Lady Li of Li." Ai was a Rong territory, and the "warden" was its border guardian. When she first left the Rong lands for Jin, she grieved, but once she attained nobility, sharing the king’s couch and feasting, she regretted her initial tears—this serves as an analogy for life and death.

The saying, "One who dreams of drinking wine may wake weeping; one who dreams of weeping may wake to go hunting," appears in many dream-interpretation texts. Such transformations between dream and waking are so fluid that, within the dream, one does not recognize it as a dream—even attempting to interpret it—only to awaken and realize both the dream and its interpretation were illusions. These passages subtly capture the nuances of human nature. If one grasps this, one sees that the exchanges between Wei Jie and Yue Guang, though insightful, do not reach such depth—this is a matter of great significance in learning. For instance, in Yue Guang’s lament, how does it compare to King Gaozong’s dream of Fu Yue or Confucius’ dream of the Duke of Zhou?

The "great awakening" refers to one who has perceived the Dao—what Chan Buddhists call "great enlightenment." "Lord" signifies nobility, "herdsman" lowliness; yet fools, still dreaming, cling to distinctions of rank—how deluded they are! "Pride in small discernment" describes their narrow vision. What I say to you is also part of the dream; when I call you a dreamer, that too is a dreamer’s words. The meaning here is that the world is but an empty dream, though the phrasing is artfully strange. "Perverse consolation" means utterly bizarre. My words may seem utterly strange, yet within that strangeness lies profound truth. If, ten thousand generations hence, a great sage were to arise and comprehend these insights, it would be as if we had met in a single day. This is akin to Yang Xiong of later ages, who would surely understand my intent.

"Understanding" here means insight. Suppose you and I were to debate: if you defeat me, does that mean I am wrong and you are right? If I defeat you, does that mean I am right and you are wrong? Or might one of us be right and the other wrong? Or could both be right, or both be wrong? You and I cannot know for certain. People are inherently shrouded in darkness—whom could we appoint to judge? If we chose someone who agrees with you, they would already share your view—how could they judge fairly? If we chose someone who agrees with me, they would already share my view—how could they judge fairly? If we chose someone who differs from both of us, they would be at odds with us—how could they judge fairly? If we chose someone who agrees with both of us, they would already share our views—how could they judge fairly? Thus, you, I, and others cannot know the truth—must we await another?

This passage emerges from the principle of "enfolding one another through 'this is so,'" echoing the earlier notion of "the ends of benefit and harm." Victory and defeat cannot determine right and wrong, for in our debate, neither of us can truly know the other. "Darkness" refers to the obscurity of perception. If both parties’ views are clouded, whom can we appoint to judge? Agreement with your position is no solution, nor is agreement with mine, nor is disagreement with both, nor agreement with both. I am one perspective, you are another, and another person is yet another—three perspectives, none of which can know the others. Must we await yet another? This "another" is the workings of creation, the "Heavenly Boundary" (tianni), which is the "Heavenly Equality" (tianjun) mentioned earlier.

What does it mean to harmonize with the Heavenly Boundary? It means: "Is it so? Is it not so? If it is truly so, then the distinction between 'so' and 'not so' need not be debated. Is it truly so? Then the distinction between 'so' and 'not so' need not be debated." The interplay of opposing voices depends on their mutual opposition. If they do not oppose one another, harmonize them with the Heavenly Boundary, follow their natural unfolding, and thus exhaust the years. Forget the years, forget righteousness, roam beyond all limits, and so lodge in the boundless.

The "Boundary" (ni) means division. What harmonizes the Heavenly Boundary is simply "this is so." "This is so" and "this is not so," "so" and "not so"—both are preserved, as in the earlier principle of "walking two paths." The moment one asserts "this is so" or "this is right," a counterclaim of "not so" or "not right" arises, giving rise to disputes over right and wrong.

Voices are speech; "transformative voices" refers to using words to convert and subdue. "Mutual opposition" means mutual confrontation and resistance. If, in disputes over right and wrong, one forcefully employs speech to set oneself in opposition and seeks to convert and subdue, why not instead follow what the other affirms and avoid mutual resistance? Thus it is said, "if they do not oppose one another." These two characters are most extraordinary. "If they" may be read as "how could it resemble?" If they do not oppose but still harmonize, then one may harmonize them with the Heavenly Boundary and roam freely, exhausting the years. Thus it is said, "follow their natural unfolding," "so exhaust the years." "Follow" means to comply; "unfolding" means to roam freely; "exhaust the years" is like Du Fu’s "carefree passage of days and months." If one can do this, not only may one exhaust the years, but one may even forget the years, and not only forget the years, but even forget principles of righteousness. Once years and righteousness are forgotten, one may stir and dance in the realm of nothingness—this "stir" conveys the meaning of "carefree wandering." Having wandered carefree in the realm of nothingness, one may lodge there for a lifetime.

The dim shadow beside the reflection asked the reflection: "Just now you were walking, now you have stopped; just now you were sitting, now you have risen. Why are you so lacking in constancy?" The reflection replied: "Do I depend on something to be thus? Does what I depend on also depend on something to be thus? Do I depend on the snake’s molted skin or the cicada’s wings? How could I know why it is so, or why it is not so?" This passage arises from the notion of "dependence." The dim shadow refers to the faint outline beside the reflection. "Lacking in constancy" means having no fixed measure. "I depend on something to be thus" means the reflection’s movement depends on the form. Though I depend on the form, the form itself depends on something else—it depends on the Creator. The form as form is no more than the snake’s molted skin or the cicada’s wings. Do I merely depend on that? The cicada has transformed, yet its molted skin and wings remain—this is its shedding. How could they move on their own? Since I depend on the form, and the form depends on something else, how could I know why it is so or not so? This is the analogy for right and wrong depending on one another.

Once, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, fluttering about as a butterfly, self-content and at ease, unaware that he was Zhou. Suddenly he awoke, and there he was, solidly Zhou. But he did not know whether Zhou had dreamed he was a butterfly, or the butterfly had dreamed it was Zhou. Between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction—this is called the transformation of things. This passage arises from the earlier discussion of dreams. "Fluttering" describes the butterfly in flight. "Self-content" means self-delight; "at ease" means carefree. In the dream, as a butterfly, he was utterly carefree, forgetting his own existence, hence "unaware that he was Zhou." "Solidly" describes the stiffness of waking in bed. Such passages are like brushstrokes in a painting. For Zhuang Zhou, the night’s dream of being a butterfly might make the butterfly, in turn, take his present waking state as a dream. Thus he said, "he did not know whether Zhou had dreamed he was a butterfly, or the butterfly had dreamed it was Zhou." Between dream and waking, there must be a point of distinction, hence "between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction." This sentence seems to conclude yet does not, leaving it unspoken, precisely to prompt inquiry—much like a Chan "critical phrase." "This is called the transformation of things" means this is the principle of the myriad things’ transformation.

This chapter, titled "Discourse on Leveling All Things," concludes with two analogies. The writing is extraordinarily ingenious, and the meaning profoundly subtle. One who awakens to this will see that there is no right or wrong to dispute—just as it is said, "life and death do not alter the self," let alone the concerns of profit and harm. The beginning and end resonate, now severed, now connected, now arising from one another yet not continuous, forming a single piece of writing. The brushwork rises and falls thus; read it thoroughly, and it yields boundless flavor.

*Southern Florescence Scripture Oral Exegesis, Scroll 4*
*By Lin Xiang of Yuanzhai*

The "Nurturing the Lord of Life" in the Inner Chapters—this "Lord" is akin to what the Chan school calls the "true master." To nurture the master of this life is what Daoists refer to as the "foundation of the elixir." First speaking of the joy of free wandering, then of the absence of right and wrong, we arrive here at the work of cultivating oneself. These three chapters seem to follow a sequence, though what follows does not entirely adhere to it.

"My life has its limits, yet knowledge is without bounds. To pursue the boundless with the bounded is perilous." And yet those who claim to know are but courting peril. *Ya* means "limit" or "boundary." Human life has its limits, its finite span. *Zhi* means "thought," and the mind’s reflections are endless. To chase infinite thought with a finite body is to be swept into ceaseless turmoil—when will it end? *Dai yi* expresses the gravity of this danger. *Yi* is a grammatical particle. The following *yi* echoes the preceding one, as in the "Equalizing Things" chapter.

Amidst such peril, to still employ calculation and cunning, priding oneself on knowledge and ability—such a one, I see, will meet only peril in the end. Reiterating *dai* reinforces the warning for later generations. This *dai* is the same as the *wei wei* ("only peril") in the *Book of Documents*. As for "those who claim to know," it is like saying "the enlightened." Enlightened, they act with purpose.

"In doing good, avoid proximity to fame; in doing evil, avoid proximity to punishment. Follow the *du* as your constant path—thus can you preserve your body, fulfill your life, nourish your kin, and live out your years." These lines precisely encapsulate the art of nurturing life, the self-cultivation to which Zhuangzi devoted himself.

"In doing good, avoid proximity to fame" means that even in virtuous acts, one should not seek renown. "In doing evil, avoid proximity to punishment" means that even in wrongdoing, one should not invite condemnation. This aligns with the "Webbed Toes" chapter’s admonition: "Above, one dares not cling to the conduct of benevolence and righteousness; below, one dares not engage in licentious or deviant acts." *Du* means "urgency"—that is, to respond only when pressed, to act only when unavoidable.

To roam the world with the mind, leaving no trace of good or evil to be named, and simply follow the natural patterns of Heaven—responding only when compelled, and doing so without contrivance—this is the constant way. *Yuan* means "to follow"; *jing* means "constant." To make a habit of rising only when pressed is the essence. Thus can one preserve the body, fulfill the principle of life, honor one’s parents, and live out one’s natural span—just as Mencius said, "Whether long-lived or short-lived, one remains unwavering, cultivating oneself to await its end."

Mencius speaks from the standpoint of mind and nature, and thus his tone is so upright; Zhuangzi, from the standpoint of spontaneity, and thus his words flow so freely. Though their language differs, their intent in teaching others is the same.

Huian, interpreting *du* as "center," found the thread of the passage incomplete when considering the lines about avoiding fame and punishment. He remarked: "If one fears the entanglements of fame and does not fully exert oneself in learning, one inclines toward evil. 'In doing evil, avoid proximity to punishment' suggests choosing transgressions that do not incur legal penalties, cunningly navigating to evade consequences—leading one to conclude that Zhuangzi advocates reckless abandon." Yet if one examines the flow of Zhuangzi’s words alongside the "Webbed Toes" chapter, this interpretation does not hold. Though *du* can mean "center," it is better rendered as "urgency," as the text itself confirms—this is the most precise reading.

Cook Ding carved an ox for Lord Wenhui. Where his hand touched, his shoulder leaned, his foot pressed, his knee braced—*xu* and *xiang* sounded in unison, the blade *huo*-ed through, all in perfect rhythm, harmonizing with the dance of *Sanglin* and matching the cadence of *Jingshou*.

Lord Wenhui exclaimed: "Ah! Excellent! How has your skill reached such heights?"

"Where his hand touched"—the motion of contact. "Where his shoulder leaned"—when the hand exerts force, the shoulder tilts. "Where his foot pressed"—as he applies strength, his stance naturally adjusts. "Where his knee braced"—*yi* means a slight bend; as he leans into the ox, his knee flexes. These four lines depict the butcher at work. *Xue* is the sound of entry; *huo*, the sound of severing.

The sounds *xu*, *xiang*, and *huo*—all are the noises of his blade in use—yet the phrase "wielding the knife" is placed between them: such is the structure of the text. As in the *Seventh Month* poem: "In the eighth month, it is in the wilds; in the ninth month, it is beneath the eaves; in the tenth month, the cricket is under my bed." Here, too, the word "cricket" is positioned in the middle. "Wielding the knife" means advancing the blade; to advance with the knife is called *zou*. "None failed to strike the note" means that the sounds *xu*, *xiang*, and *huo* all accorded with the pitch-pipes. *Sanglin* and *Jingshou* are both names of musical compositions; dance is accompanied by music, and *hui* refers to the gathering of dancers. "Harmonizing with *Sanglin*" and "matching the cadence of *Jingshou*" also describe how his movements aligned with the rhythms of the pitch-pipes. Lord Wenhui was King Hui of Liang. *Xi* expresses admiration. "How has your skill reached such heights?" means "How wondrous it is!" Cook Ding set down his blade and replied: "What your servant delights in is the Dao, which surpasses mere skill. When I first began to carve oxen, all I saw was the ox. After three years, I no longer saw the whole ox. To set down the blade and respond thus is to say that my skill was attained through the study of the Dao, and only afterward did I reach this level of technique—it is not mere technique. That after three years I no longer saw the whole ox means that the parts of the ox’s body where it could be carved were all apparent at a glance, without need for force.

Now, I encounter it with my spirit rather than with my eyes, and my senses cease while my spirit moves. I follow the natural patterns, cleaving the great seams, guiding the blade through the great cavities, proceeding according to what is inherently so. I have never touched the *kenqing* or the *qing*—how much less the great bones! To encounter with the spirit rather than with the eyes means that the mind unites with it; *yu* means to unite. The *guan* are the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. That the senses cease means that when one stands in stillness, the ears and eyes perceive nothing; the knowledge of the senses halts, while the spirit moves of itself—this is the natural course. The *tianli* are the ox’s natural grain; to *yi* is to follow that natural grain in carving. The *da xi* are the junctions of bone and flesh; *pi* means to strike, and *kuan* means hollow—the spaces between the joints are naturally large and empty. To *dao* is to follow and carve along them. The junctions of bone and flesh, the hollows of the joints—all are inherently so, and I simply proceed accordingly. In my technique, the use of the blade has never once touched the *kenrong* or the *qing*. *Qing* is pronounced *qing*; the *kenqing* are the points where bone and flesh adhere. If even the *kenqing* are untouched by the blade, how much more the great bones! A good cook changes his knife every year, for he cuts. An ordinary cook changes his knife every month, for he hacks. My blade has now been in use for nineteen years, having carved several thousand oxen, yet its edge is as if newly whetted. A good cook is one who excels at his craft; an ordinary cook is one of the common sort, inferior. The inferior cook must change his knife every month, for he chops at the great bones and damages or breaks his blade. The good cook changes his knife every year, for even when he works between the *kenrong*, he may still cut, and so his blade wears out. But my knife has been in use for nineteen years, and though I have carved many oxen, its edge remains as if freshly sharpened—it has suffered no damage. The *xing* is a whetstone.

Where the joints have spaces and the blade has no thickness, to insert what has no thickness into what has space is to find ample room for the blade to move freely. Thus, after nineteen years, the edge of my knife is as if newly whetted. Where the joints have spaces—the ox’s joints naturally have gaps—and my blade is exceedingly thin, to follow those gaps with such a thin blade is to allow the edge to advance within them. "Ample room" means there is no obstruction. This passage speaks of how the difficulty or ease of worldly affairs all follow natural principles; if I simply proceed in accordance with them, without resisting or disturbing my mind, I remain at ease, and nothing can harm my life—this is the method of nurturing life.

Yet whenever I come to a cluster, I see the difficulty, and I am alert, my gaze fixed, my movements slow, my blade moving with utmost care. Then, with a *che*-sound, it is parted, like earth crumbling to the ground. I raise my knife and look around, filled with satisfaction, then wipe the blade and put it away. Lord Wenhui said: "Excellent! From Cook Ding’s words, I have learned how to nurture life." Though this is but a turn of phrase, it carries great meaning. For in navigating the world, how can one always meet with favorable circumstances? There are also times of adversity. When such moments arise, one must adapt and proceed with flexibility. It is easy to move through favorable circumstances, but when faced with adversity, one often becomes flustered, even to the point of ruin—how can one’s mind remain undisturbed? This is why this turn is added. *Zu* means a gathering, referring to the places where the ox’s sinews and bones converge. Though I say I no longer see the whole ox with my eyes, and though I use my blade only in the great seams and cavities, when I come to the tangled clusters of sinew and bone, I still recognize the difficulty and treat it as a challenge.

*Chu* means to be stirred; *jie* means to be vigilant. "My gaze fixed" means that when I look, my eyes pause, and then my movements with the blade become slow. This merely expresses the care I take. Having taken such care, my blade moves with great subtlety, lightly and without force. *Che* is pronounced *te*; *jie* is pronounced *xie*...

*Huo* means suddenness; *jie* means to disperse—this describes how, with such light effort, the bones and flesh suddenly separate of their own accord, like earth crumbling to the ground, speaking to its abundance and ease. Once the ox is fully dismembered, I lift my blade and stand, gazing leisurely about. *Chouchu* means unhurried, the self-contentment of one at ease; *manzhi* means fulfillment, not that one’s ambitions are self-satisfied, but that this fulfills my intent. Why is it fulfilling? Because I dismember the ox without force, and though I dismember, the blade remains unharmed—this is why it is fulfilling. *Shandao* means to carefully tend to the blade and put it away.

This meaning is meant to illustrate how, when one encounters adversity, one can respond with natural compliance, keeping the mind undisturbed. Once the matter passes, one transforms with the situation, resting in non-action as if nothing had ever occurred. The passage beginning *"To do good without seeking fame"* directly expounds the method of nurturing life, while the story of Pao Ding serves as its metaphor. Here, at the very end, it lightly concludes with four characters: *"one attains the nurturing of life"*—this is where the momentum of the text is effortlessly guided, and it must be examined closely.

Gongwen Xuan saw the Right Master and exclaimed in shock: "What sort of person is this? Why is he one-legged? Did Heaven do this to him, or was it man?" He replied: "It was Heaven, not man."

Heaven’s creation of this one-legged being was to make him solitary, while man’s appearance is naturally paired. From this we know it was Heaven, not man.

Gongwen is the surname, Xuan the given name. The Right Master was a man who had undergone foot-amputation and held the office of Right Master. *Jie* means solitary—having lost one foot and retaining only one. *Was it Heaven or man?* asks whether his condition arose from Heaven’s design at birth or from human amputation. Though the amputation was clearly man’s doing, he says it was Heaven, not man. *Heaven’s creation of this being was to make him solitary* means that when Heaven made him, it intended him to have only one foot. How do we know this? Because the form and appearance of all people include two feet that walk side by side; among the multitude, he alone is different—this is Heaven’s doing, not man’s. *Paired* means walking side by side. This suggests that in the human world, excess and deficiency are all the work of Creation. Even when it appears to be man’s doing, it is ultimately Creation’s design. The intent is that when one encounters adversity, one should accept it with compliance.

The marsh pheasant takes ten steps for a single peck, a hundred steps for a single drink—it does not wish to be kept in a cage. Though its spirit may flourish, it is not well. The earlier discussion of accepting adversity with compliance aligns with the idea in the Pao Ding story that "whenever he reached a complex joint, I saw where the difficulty lay." Here, in these few lines, the marsh pheasant is used as a metaphor, illustrating that in human life, adversity is common—like treading on a tiger’s tail or wandering within Archer Yi’s range. The marsh pheasant takes ten steps for a single peck, a hundred steps for a single drink, emphasizing the difficulty of its sustenance. If kept in a cage, it would have ample food and drink, yet the pheasant does not desire this, hence *it does not wish to be kept in a cage*. *Qi* means to desire; *fan* means cage. Why does it not wish this? Though the caged pheasant’s food and drink may be plentiful, and its spirit may seem to flourish, it is ultimately not content. Thus it is said: *though its spirit may flourish, it is not well*. *Wang* is pronounced as "flourishing"; *not well* means not content. The intent is that one who cherishes their own life should not be submerged in worldly entanglements but should instead preserve their integrity.

When Lao Dan died, Qin Shi went to mourn him. He wailed three times and departed. A disciple asked: "Was he not your friend?" He replied: "He was." "Then is such mourning appropriate?" He said: "It is. At first, I thought him an extraordinary man, but now I see he was not. Earlier, when I entered to mourn, I saw the elders weeping for him as if for their own children, and the young weeping as if for their own mothers. The reason they gathered like this must be that they spoke words they did not intend to speak and wept tears they did not intend to shed—this is fleeing from Heaven and betraying true feeling, forgetting what they had received. The ancients called this *the punishment of fleeing from Heaven*." Zhuangzi’s teachings originate from Laozi, and here he first criticizes Laozi, which serves as a prelude to his criticism of Yao and Shun. I, the Master, take the Dao as my foundation; I have no partiality even toward Laozi, let alone others. *He wailed three times and departed* means he did not indulge in emotion. The disciple’s question suggests that Laozi was Qin Shi’s friend, so why did he mourn without emotion? The Master refers to Qin Shi. *At first, I thought him an extraordinary man* means I initially took Laozi to be an exceptional person, but upon mourning him, I realized he was not. Why? When Laozi died, his disciples—young and old alike—wept with such sorrow. This indicates that Laozi had not transcended his physical form and had moved his disciples’ hearts, so their words and tears of grief and longing arose spontaneously, without premeditation. What Heaven bestows is fundamentally formless, yet if one is moved by emotion, it means forgetting the original endowment and fleeing from Heaven’s principle, betraying true feeling. Such actions offend Heaven, hence *the punishment of fleeing from Heaven*. *Bei* is synonymous with *betray*.

*Coming at the right time, Master, is timing; departing at the right time, Master, is compliance.* Resting in the right time and abiding in compliance, no single moment of joy can enter. The ancients called this *the release from Heaven’s bonds*. Having discussed the Qin Shi passage above, this now elucidates the principle of fully understanding life and death, concluding the chapter. The intent is for people to recognize that what occurs naturally should not disturb their minds in matters of life and death—only then can one nurture life. *Master* is a term of respect for one who embodies the Dao. It means that among those with the Dao in the world, their coming is at the right time, and their going is at the right time—one should simply follow the timing and comply. Once one understands the naturalness of coming and going, arrival is not a cause for joy, nor is departure a cause for sorrow. *Cannot enter* means it cannot disturb the mind. *Xuan* means the mind is bound. *Di* means Heaven. Knowing the naturalness of Heaven’s principle, even Heaven cannot bind one with life and death. It means that even Heaven has no power over me. Thus it is called *the release from Heaven’s bonds*.

*The flame is limited by the fuel, yet the fire is transmitted—its end is unknown.* This is a metaphor for life and death. It is like using firewood to kindle a flame: if you focus on the firewood, it will eventually be exhausted, yet the fire in the world has been passed down from ancient times to the present, never ceasing, and its end has never been seen. These three lines are extraordinary prose. The principle of life and death cannot be fully expressed in words, yet earlier the text discusses the principle, and here it concludes with a metaphor—is this not the most exquisite part of the writing? *The Oral Exegesis of the True Scripture of Southern Florescence, Volume Four* ends here.

**The Oral Exegesis of the True Scripture of Southern Florescence, Volume Five**
*By Lin Xiang of Yongzhai*

**Inner Chapters: "The Human World" (Part One)**

The preceding section spoke of nurturing life; this one speaks of engaging with the world. It means that since we possess this body and dwell in this world, how can we completely sever ourselves from human affairs? The key is to navigate them well.

Seeing this intent, how could Zhuangzi be impractical? How could he fail to grasp worldly matters? This aligns with the meaning in the Outer Chapters: *"Nothing should be done, yet nothing can be left undone."*

Yan Hui sought an audience with Confucius, requesting permission to depart.
Confucius asked, *"Where are you going?"*
Yan Hui replied, *"I intend to go to Wei."*
*"What will you do there?"*
Yan Hui said, *"I have heard that the lord of Wei is young in years, acts willfully, treats his state lightly without recognizing his faults, and squanders the lives of his people. The dead in his realm are as numerous as reeds in a marsh—so much so that the people have nowhere to turn.*

*"His youth and willfulness"* refer to his being young and self-reliant, unmoved by others’ opinions. *"Treating his state lightly without recognizing his faults"* means he governs carelessly, unaware of his errors. *"Squandering the lives of his people"* describes his reckless disregard for their survival, as if they were mere fodder. *"The dead in his realm are as reeds in a marsh"* compares the slaughtered to the abundance of reeds in a wetland, implying he treats his people as worthless as grass. The *Fu Guo* chapter of the *Xunzi* contains a similar phrase, *"measured by the marsh"*—here, the word order is inverted to *"marsh-like reeds,"* a striking literary flourish.

For example:
*"Cloud"* is a marsh; *"Dream"* is also a marsh. In ancient times, the Yunmeng region was entirely water, but now it has land for cultivation. Yet we do not say *"Yunmeng’s soil is tilled"* (*yun meng tu zuo yao yi*), but rather *"Yun’s soil, Meng’s tilled"* (*yun tu meng zuo*).
Similarly, *"dark"* is fine, *"white"* is fine—yet we do not say *"dark-white fine"* (*xuan gao xian*), but *"dark-fine-white"* (*xuan xian gao*).
This is a rhetorical device.

*"Where"* means *"to go."* *"The people have nowhere to turn"* means they have no refuge.

Yan Hui had once heard the Master say: *"Leave well-governed states; go to disordered ones. A physician’s gate is crowded with the sick."* He wished to apply what he had learned, hoping the state might yet be healed.

Confucius sighed and said, *"Alas! You will likely go only to be punished."*

The Dao does not tolerate杂乱.杂乱 leads to excess, excess to disturbance, disturbance to anxiety, and anxiety cannot be remedied.

The utmost person of old first established it within themselves before establishing it in others. If what is established within oneself is not yet settled, how can one attend to the conduct of violent men?

Moreover, do you understand how virtue is swayed and from where knowledge arises? Virtue is swayed by fame; knowledge arises from contention. Fame is a tool for mutual suppression; knowledge is an instrument of strife. Both are inauspicious tools—not to be employed without restraint.

If your virtue is profound and your trustworthiness evident, yet you have not aligned with the other’s qi; if your reputation is illustrious and your conduct uncontentious, yet you have not reached their heart—then to forcibly present them with the language of benevolence, righteousness, standards, and methods is to display your own excellence before a violent man. People will resent your possession of such beauty, calling you a *"calamitous man."* One who brings calamity to others will surely face retaliation. You will likely become a target of their harm.

The saying goes: *"In a state with the Dao, appear; in a state without the Dao, withdraw."* This is the teaching of sages and worthies. Yet Zhuangzi reverses it, saying: *"Leave well-governed states; go to disordered ones."* It is like a physician: only when many are sick can one practice their art. If a state is already well-ordered, what need is there for you?

*"Wishing to apply what I have heard"* means Yan Hui wanted to convey to the lord of Wei what he had learned from Confucius, urging him to reflect on proper principles and reform, hoping the state might be stabilized.

*"You will likely go only to be punished"*: *"You"* refers to Yan Hui; *"likely"* means *"will."* If you go in this manner, you will only be executed by him—meaning it is inadvisable to go.

*"The Dao does not tolerate杂乱"* means that when the mind is uncluttered, it is pure, empty, and luminous. If one harbors intentions—thinking, *"Since he acts thus, how should I save him?"*—this is already杂乱 within oneself. If one is not pure, how can one save others?

*"杂乱 leads to excess"* means becoming entangled in many concerns. *"Disturbance"* means chaos; *"anxiety"* means self-torment. You would only torment yourself—how could you save others?

The ancients first cultivated what was within themselves before admonishing others. If what is within oneself is not yet settled, how can one attend to others? Even if their conduct is violent, you are already tormented—how can you attend to their virtue?

*"Virtue"* refers to naturalness; *"knowledge"* refers to private cunning. The moment one seeks fame, one’s natural virtue is already lost. The moment one employs private knowledge, contention arises. Thus it is said: *"Virtue is swayed by fame; knowledge arises from contention."*

*"Mutual suppression"* means mutual undermining. *"Instrument of strife"* means that if I use private knowledge, they will too, and the more we contend, the worse it becomes. *"Instrument"* here means *"tool."*

Fame and knowledge are both inauspicious matters in the world—one cannot act upon them without consequence, for doing so will surely invite disaster.

*"Profound"* means deep; *"profound virtue"* is true virtue. *"Profound"* implies sincerity and trustworthy conduct. Even if one possesses virtue and trustworthiness, if one has not aligned with the other’s nature and qi; even if one has a fine reputation and uncontentious conduct, if one has not reached their heart—then to forcibly present the language of benevolence, righteousness, standards, and methods before a violent man is to make them resent you, believing you are boasting of your own excellence.

*"Standards"* refers to regulations; *"methods"* is synonymous with *"techniques."*

*"Calamitous man"* means a harmful person. They will surely call you a *"calamitous man,"* and once branded as such, the harm will rebound upon you. If you go now, you will likely only bring calamity upon yourself—how could you transform the lord of Wei and save his state?

Moreover, if one merely delights in the worthy and detests the unworthy, what use is there in seeking to be different? If you do not await summons, the king and nobles will surely seize upon your words to contend for victory, and your eyes will grow dazed, your countenance will flatten in submission, your mouth will stammer in defense, your bearing will betray fear, and your heart will yield to compliance. This is like quenching fire with fire or flooding water with water—it only adds to the excess. Following such a course will lead to endless peril. If you speak earnestly without first establishing trust, you will surely die before a violent man.

If he already knows the worthy and delights in them, and knows the unworthy and detests them, what need has he for you? He would seek elsewhere. Thus it is said: *What use is there in seeking to be different?* It is precisely because he does not distinguish between the worthy and the unworthy that he acts as he does. If he does not recognize worthiness, how could he know you are worthy and trust your words?

*"Summons"* means to call. *"You"* refers to yourself. The lord of Wei has never summoned you, hence it is said: *If you do not await summons.* Since you go uninvited, he, in his noble rank, will surely seize upon your words to vie for victory. *"Contend"* means to struggle; *"victory"* means to prevail. Once cornered by him, your eyes will grow dim, *"dazed"* meaning bewildered. *"Your countenance will flatten in submission"* means you will alter your expression to appease him, bowing in deference to extricate yourself. *"Your mouth will stammer in defense"* means you will stammer to explain and justify yourself. *"Your bearing will betray fear"* means your posture will reveal terror, trembling and prostration. *"Your heart will yield to compliance"* means you will submit in your heart. Emperor Wu of Liang’s debate with He Chen perfectly mirrors this hexagram’s omen—it speaks of contention ending in self-submission.

If the other party is already violent and then defeats you, his arrogance will only grow. This is truly like quenching fire with fire or flooding water with water. *"Excess"* means increase; *"adds to the excess"* means his malice will only multiply. Proceeding thus, his wickedness will know no end, and his brutality will only worsen. *"Earnest words"* means profound speech. You have not yet earned his trust, yet you, untrusted, speak profoundly before a violent man—you will surely be killed by him.

In ancient times, Jie killed Guan Longfeng, and Zhou killed Prince Bigan—both had cultivated themselves to humbly serve the people, thus defying their superiors. Their rulers, resenting their virtue, cast them out. They were lovers of reputation. In former times, Yao attacked Congzhi and Xu’ao, and Yu attacked Youhu, leaving their lands desolate and their bodies mutilated. Their ceaseless warfare and insatiable pursuit of fame and gain were all for the sake of reputation and profit. Have you not heard of this? Reputation and profit are things even the sages cannot overcome—how much less can you?

Guan Longfeng and Bigan cultivated themselves to love the people, not realizing the people belonged to others. You, in turn, humbly serve them—*"humbly serve"* means to cherish and nurture. Jie and Zhou did not love the people, yet you love *their* people, thus defying your superior. This is why they were killed. *"Cultivated"* means to refine; resenting their refinement, their rulers turned against them—this was the fault of their love of reputation.

Congzhi, Xu’ao, and Youhu are all allegories. Their lands became ruins, their deaths left them as vengeful spirits—*"vengeful"* meaning ghosts without descendants or refuge. Their downfall to such ruin came from ceaseless warfare in pursuit of fame and profit. *"Profit"* means material gain. *"Cannot overcome"* means cannot endure. Those who seek reputation and self-interest—even Yao and Yu could not endure them, leading to the destruction of their states—how much less can you?

Though this is so, if you must have some purpose, come and tell me of it. Yan Hui said: *"Be upright yet empty, diligent yet single-minded—would that suffice?"* The reply: *"How could it?"* For one who exults in yang energy, whose countenance shifts unpredictably, is what ordinary men dare not oppose. If you rely on what moves others to seek favor with their hearts, this is called *"daily gradual virtue"*—and even this cannot be achieved, let alone great virtue. Stubborn and unyielding, outwardly compliant yet inwardly unrepentant—how could this ever suffice?

Another turn is taken: if you insist on going, you must have some purpose—come, try and tell me. *"Try"* means to attempt; *"come"* is an auxiliary particle. *"Upright yet empty"* means to straighten your bearing and empty your heart; *"diligent yet single-minded"* means to strive earnestly and remain steadfast to the end. Could this work?

*"How could it?"* means it is utterly impossible. *"Exults in yang energy"* means one who has attained power, his qi swelling and his demeanor triumphant. *"His countenance shifts unpredictably"* means his haughty expression is ever-changing. Ordinary men dare not defy him, submitting in fear. Seeing that all fear him, if you seek to move him with words, he will demand you submit to his will to satisfy his desires—hence it is said: *seek favor with their hearts.* *"Favor"* means self-satisfaction. *"Daily gradual"* refers to minor virtue; it is said that even such small virtue cannot be achieved by people like you—how could you achieve great virtue?

*"Stubborn and unyielding"* means obstinate and unchanging. If so, you will outwardly seek compliance through upright emptiness while inwardly clinging to your diligence and single-mindedness, believing yourself free of fault. But with such limited skill, how could you ever deem this sufficient?

Thus, I am inwardly upright yet outwardly yielding, achieving alignment with the highest standards.

To be *"inwardly upright"* is to follow Heaven as one’s companion. Those who follow Heaven know that the Son of Heaven and oneself are both children of Heaven, so how could one alone seek praise for one’s words when others do good, or seek blame when others do ill? Such a person is called *"childlike"*—this is what it means to follow Heaven as one’s companion.

To be *"outwardly yielding"* is to follow others as one’s companion. Kneeling with hands clasped and bowing low—these are the rites of a minister. If all others perform them, how dare I not do the same? To do what others do is to incur no fault from them—this is what it means to follow others as one’s companion.

To *"achieve alignment with the highest"* is to follow the ancients as one’s companion. Though one’s words may resemble instruction, they are in truth admonitions—what the ancients possessed, not what I possess. In this way, though one speaks directly, it is not deemed a fault—this is what it means to follow the ancients as one’s companion.

If this is so, is it acceptable?
Then, further below, a response in the voice of Yanzi is set forth, divided into three parts.

*"Inwardly upright"* means inwardly preserving this principle to guard one’s true reality—here, *"upright"* is akin to *"true."* From the nobility of the Son of Heaven down to myself, all are born of Heaven, and thus all emerge from the natural. How could one dare to act selfishly in one’s words, seeking praise for what one deems right and blame for what one deems wrong? Without such selfish intent, one remains as unblemished as a child—thus in harmony with Heaven. Hence it is said: *to follow Heaven as one’s companion.*

*"Outwardly yielding"* means outwardly fulfilling the rites of kneeling with hands clasped and bowing low. If all others perform them, then I too perform them, and others find no fault in me. This refers to the rites of submission. Though it may go against the crowd, I follow the lower path, generating such discourse to mock the sagely gate in this manner—thus in harmony with others. Hence it is said: *to follow others as one’s companion.*

*"Achieving"* refers to one’s own established doctrines. *"Alignment"* means accord—taking one’s established doctrines and aligning them with the ancients above, citing the ancients as evidence. Though one borrows the ancients’ instructive words, these are in fact direct admonitions of right and wrong, all bearing the weight of reproach. For one’s words do not originate from oneself but are what the ancients have already spoken. In this way, though one speaks bluntly to expose another’s conduct, others do not deem it a fault. Hence it is said: *though direct, it is not a fault.* To *"follow the ancients as one’s companion"* means one’s doctrines accord with the ancients.

If this is so, is it acceptable?
Confucius said: *"No, it will not do. There are far too many administrative measures and methods, yet they remain unsettled. Though steadfast, one is still without fault—but this is all one achieves. How can such an approach transform others? It is still the way of one who follows their own mind."*

*"Administrative"* refers to affairs; *"methods"* to procedures. It means the matters and methods you speak of are too numerous and ultimately unstable. *Die* (谍) is pronounced *dié* and means *"settled."* Though one may fulfill these three, one is still without fault—yet this merely allows one to avoid blame. How can it transform others? Hence it is said: *"How can such an approach transform?"*

Where, then, lies the flaw in this? The trouble is that your three doctrines all stem from following the mind of deliberate action—this is to harbor intention, to leave traces, and thus to depart from the natural Dao.

Yan Hui said: *"I have no further progress to make. May I ask the method?"*
Confucius replied: *"Fast! I will tell you. To act upon what you possess—is this easy? Those who find it easy are not fit for the luminous heavens."*
Yan Hui said: *"My family is poor. For months I have drunk no wine and eaten no meat. Is this fasting?"*
*"That is the fasting of sacrificial rites,"* he said, *"not the fasting of the mind."*
*"May I ask what the fasting of the mind is?"*
Confucius said: *"Unify your will. Do not listen with the ears but listen with the mind. Do not listen with the mind but listen with qi. Listening stops at the ears; the mind stops at signs. Qi is that which is empty and awaits things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness—emptiness is the fasting of the mind."*

*"No further progress"* means there is nothing higher to aspire to. *"To act upon what you possess—is this easy?"* means: *"You claim to have these skills and think it easy to put them into practice."* But the moment such a facile attitude arises, the intent of the luminous heavens is no longer pleased. Hence it is said: *"Those who find it easy are not fit for the luminous heavens."* These two lines are among the most practical and vital in life.

The fasting of sacrificial rites is external; the fasting of the mind is internal. *"Unify your will"* means to focus the mind without distraction. To listen with the ears is still external; to listen with the mind is still within the self; to listen with qi is to be without thing. Listening with the ears stops at the ears and does not enter the mind; listening with the mind requires external things to correspond with the self, creating a division between self and other. Qi follows the natural and awaits things with emptiness—emptiness is the Dao. Emptiness is where the Dao resides, hence: *"Only the Dao gathers in emptiness."* This very emptiness is the fasting of the mind.

Yan Hui said: *"Before I received your instruction, I was simply myself. Now that I have received it, there is no longer any 'me.' Can this be called emptiness?"*
The Master said: *"It is complete. 'Received instruction'* means having been taught. This is Yanzi’s sudden awakening: before receiving instruction, there was still a self; after receiving it, there is no longer a self. To forget the self is to be empty. *"It is complete"* means your words have fully expressed the principle.

*"I will tell you: if you can enter and wander within its cage without being moved by its names—*
*If they enter, then sing; if they do not enter, then stop.*
*Without gate, without poison,*
*Dwell in the one and lodge in necessity—then you are nearly there."*

*"You"* refers to Yan Hui. The world is like a cage—if you can enter and wander within it without being swayed by empty names (for wherever there are traces, there are names; and wherever there is advancement, the mind is stirred), then to be without intention is to leave no traces, and to be without advancement is to keep the mind unstirred. Hence: *"wander within its cage without being moved by its names."* What follows is the method for navigating the world.

*"If they enter, then sing"* means: if they are receptive to words, then speak to them. *"If they do not enter, then stop"* means: if they are not receptive, do not speak to them. The meaning is the same as in the *Analects*, though the phrasing is striking. Where there is a fixed direction, there is a gate; where there is no fixed direction, there is no gate. Where there is scent or flavor, there is poison; where there is none, there is no poison. *"Poison"* refers to the taste of medicine. These are all metaphors for being without intention or traces.

*"Dwell"* means to reside. To take the undifferentiated one as your dwelling and lodge this mind in necessity is to master the way of living in the human world. *"Nearly"* means complete.

*"To leave no traces is easy; to walk without treading is difficult."*
*"Traces"* are the marks of advancing feet. To stop and not move is to leave no footprints—this is easy. But how can one not walk? To walk upon the earth without leaving traces of treading is difficult. The idea is that to do nothing at all is easy, but what is human life if not action? To act without acting and yet accomplish everything—that is difficult.

*"To be employed by man is easy to falsify; to be employed by Heaven is difficult to falsify."*
*"To be employed by man is easy to falsify"* means that when one is driven by human desires, it is easy to resort to deception. Only by emptying the mind and following the workings of creation can one be without falsity. *"Employed by man"* refers to human desires; *"employed by Heaven"* refers to the daily workings of heavenly principle. The words *"easy"* and *"difficult"* carry meaning: *"easy"* means prone to straying; *"difficult"* means admitting no falsity.

*"I have heard of flying with wings, but never of flying without wings.*
*I have heard of knowing with knowledge, but never of knowing without knowledge."*

*"I have heard of flying with wings"* refers to birds, which must fly with wings. To fly without wings is to be swift without haste, to arrive without traveling—this is what is called the numinous. This line serves as a metaphor for the next: for humans, knowing with knowledge is the norm. Only by knowing what one does not know does one attain the knowing of non-knowing—this is the subtlety of attaining the Dao.

*"Look upon that empty chamber: an empty room generates brightness.*
*Auspiciousness rests where it rests. If one does not rest, this is called sitting in motion."*

*"Look"* means to gaze. This uses the empty room as a metaphor for the mind. Gazing upon that secluded chamber, wherever there is an opening, light enters—light emerges from emptiness. Taking that emptiness as a metaphor for the self, one sees that emptiness naturally generates clarity. *"Generates brightness"* means generates illumination. It does not say *"generates illumination"* but *"generates whiteness"*—this is Zhuangzi’s striking phrasing. This very place of empty clarity is where the myriad things gather. *"Auspiciousness"* is fortune; *"rests where it rests"*—the second *"rests"* refers to emptiness.

Only in stillness is there emptiness; only in emptiness is there clarity—this is the meaning of "from precepts arises concentration, from concentration arises wisdom." If I allow the mind to take hold yet cannot still it, though the body sits here, the mind races outward—how then can one achieve "sitting in forgetfulness"? This uses the phrase *"sitting in motion"* to contrast with *"sitting in forgetfulness."*

When the ears and eyes turn inward to communicate while the heart’s knowing turns outward, even spirits and gods will come to dwell—how much more so for men? This is the transformation of the myriad things, the pivot upon which Yu and Shun turned, the path Fuxi and Jiqu followed to their end—how much more so for those of lesser station?

The ears and eyes’ perceptions all inwardly connect to the heart. If I harbor no thoughts, then I follow the ears and eyes’ perceptions: though they communicate inwardly, they are truly external to the heart’s knowing. What does it mean to be *"external to the heart’s knowing"*? It means the heart remains unmoved, and external things cannot enter. Though one hears what is heard and sees what is seen, there is no heart in hearing or seeing. Thus, the heart’s emptiness communes with spirits and gods—how much more so for men? This is how one can transform others. *"Spirits and gods come to dwell"* means perfect sincerity is spirit-like; within this heart, spirits and gods commune with the Creator, hence *"come to dwell."*

Having spoken thus, the text concludes with a single phrase: *"This is the transformation of the myriad things."* This is the principle of creation, the source from which all things arise. The great pivot Yu and Shun beheld was no more than this; Fuxi and Jiqu followed this path to their life’s end—how much more so for those beneath them? *"Jiqu"* may refer to an ancient sage-king, though no record confirms this; it is likely a parable. *"Those of lesser station"* refers to ordinary people.

The following passage breaks off to elaborate further, not to be read as continuous with the above:

When Duke Zigao of She was about to be sent as an envoy to Qi, he asked Confucius: *"The king’s charge to Zhuliang is most weighty. Qi’s treatment of envoys is respectful yet unhurried. Even a common man cannot be swayed—how much less a feudal lord? I tremble with fear. You once told Zhuliang: ‘In matters great or small, few succeed without harmonious words to bring them to completion. If a matter fails, one faces the calamity of human laws; if it succeeds, one faces the calamity of yin and yang. Only those of virtue can ensure that, whether success or failure follows, no calamity arises.’*

*I eat coarse food without discerning its quality; my hearth has no desire for coolness. Now, having received my charge this morning, by evening I drink ice—is this not inner heat? I have not yet grasped the true nature of the task, yet I already suffer the calamity of yin and yang. If the matter fails, I face the calamity of human laws—two calamities indeed. As a minister, I am unworthy of this burden. Pray, instruct me further."*

*Zhuliang* was the Duke of She’s personal name; *Zigao* was his courtesy name. *"The charge to Zhuliang is most weighty"* means the mission to Qi is fraught with difficulty. *"Respectful yet unhurried"* means Qi treats envoys with courtesy, but their responses to matters are always slow. Even common men, when their requests go unanswered, are at a loss—how much more so for feudal lords? Hence his trembling fear.

*"You"* refers to Confucius, who had once taught him: *"In affairs great or small, few succeed without harmonious words to bring them to completion."* *"Few"* means rare; *"without harmonious words"* means without proper discourse. If a state’s affairs fail, one faces punishment—hence *"the calamity of human laws."* If one labors over plans and calculations, even success brings illness from worry—hence *"the calamity of yin and yang."* To ensure that, whether success or failure follows, no calamity arises—only those of virtue can achieve this.

All the above is Confucius’ teaching. *"Now, since receiving my charge, I no longer taste my food—coarse or fine, I know not the difference."* *"Fine"* means refined. He says even coarse food seems fine, for in ordinary times, frequent feasting keeps the kitchen hearths perpetually warm, so the cooks desire coolness but cannot attain it. Now, consumed by worry, his appetite is scant, and the hearths remain cold. *"Having received my charge this morning, by evening I drink ice—my breast burns with anxiety."* *"True nature"* means reality. He has barely received his charge and not yet grasped the task’s reality, yet he already suffers illness. If the mission fails, he faces punishment—two calamities indeed. As a minister, he cannot bear this burden. *"Bear"* means endure. *"Pray, instruct me"* means *"What further teaching can you offer?"* *"Further"* is a grammatical particle.

Confucius replied: *"Under heaven, there are two great precepts: one is fate, the other is duty. A child’s love for parents is fate—it cannot be untied from the heart. A minister’s service to his lord is duty—there is no place where the lord is not present, no escape within heaven and earth. These are called the great precepts.*

*Thus, in serving one’s parents, one finds peace without choosing the place—this is the height of filial piety. In serving one’s lord, one finds peace without choosing the task—this is the height of loyalty. In serving one’s own heart, sorrow and joy do not alter what lies before it; knowing the inevitable and finding peace in it as fate—this is the height of virtue. As a minister and child, one is bound by what cannot be avoided. In acting according to the true nature of affairs, one forgets the self—how then can one find leisure to delight in life and dread death? You may proceed with your mission."*

This passage is entirely sound and proper. Such words on *"the human world"* show that Zhuangzi cannot be dismissed as one who speaks in grandiose, impractical terms.

*"Great precepts"* means great laws. *"Fate"* is what one receives from heaven. A child’s service to parents is born with life—this heart cannot depart for a single day, hence *"it cannot be untied."*

Virtue is what one ought to do in the human world. A minister’s service to his lord is the foremost duty in the world—by the name "lord and minister," every shore within the realm belongs to the king’s subjects. Thus it is said: wherever one goes, there is no lord who is not one’s lord, no place where one is not a subject. Where in heaven and earth could one escape? Therefore, there is no escape within the bounds of heaven and earth.

In serving one’s parents and fulfilling filial piety, one follows their commands east or west, north or south, without choosing a place of comfort to act. Once this heart is fixed on loyalty, though sorrow and joy may arise before it, they cannot alter it. For affairs may be easy or difficult, fortune or misfortune may come, but once the lord’s command is given, it becomes one’s own duty to fulfill. This is the mandate of heaven—what can one do but accept and follow it? To follow fate is to submit to it. One who can do so is a person of utmost virtue.

As a minister or child, one must consider the circumstances one encounters. If misfortune befalls and one faces difficulty, it is unavoidable—one can only act according to the truth of the matter. *Truth* means reality. One must proceed with plain sincerity; how can one then turn to consider oneself? Even if calamity comes and death or life hangs in the balance, there is nothing to be done. "You may proceed with your mission" means you have no choice but to go. "Master" here refers to Duke Ye.

I, Qiu, would now add what I have heard: in close relationships, trust must be mutual; in distant ones, loyalty must be expressed through words. Yet words must be conveyed by someone. Conveying words of mutual joy or mutual anger is the most difficult task in the world. For when both are pleased, there is often excessive praise; when both are angry, there is often excessive blame. All such excess is falsehood. Falsehood breeds distrust, and distrust brings misfortune to the messenger. Thus the *Fa Yan* says: "Convey the constant truth, do not convey excess words, and you will be nearly safe."

What follows shifts again, describing the ways of the human world. *Trust* means having something as proof, like a tally or token. *Mutual compliance* means harmony—this is how close relationships are conducted. But when relationships are distant, one must express one’s feelings through words, and *loyalty* means fully expressing those feelings. Yet how do words reach their destination? They must be transmitted by someone. In transmission, the most difficult are words of mutual joy or mutual anger. When one comes with joy and the other responds in kind, their praise often exceeds what is proper—this is called *excessive praise*. *Excess* means going beyond what is fitting. If both are angry, their blame likewise exceeds what is proper—this is called *excessive blame*. Such overstated speech is necessarily untrue, hence "all excess is falsehood." Since it is untrue, those who hear it will inevitably doubt and not fully believe. *Doubt* is the appearance of suspicion. Once suspicion arises, the ill will of both sides falls upon the messenger, who is then blamed—hence "distrust brings misfortune to the messenger." This is a warning given in light of the mission.

*Fa Yan* refers to an ancient text, cited here as evidence. "Convey the constant truth" means the messenger should only transmit plain, ordinary words, not those that go beyond what is proper. Thus: "do not convey excess words." If one transmits words in this way, one may nearly preserve oneself.

Those who contend with skill and strength begin in openness but often end in deceit. When excess prevails, there is much cunning. Those who drink wine with ritual begin in order but often end in disorder. When excess prevails, there is much strange revelry. All things are like this: they begin in sincerity but often end in pettiness. Their beginnings are simple, but by the end they become great. Words are like wind and waves; actions are like gain and loss. Wind and waves are easily stirred, gain and loss easily endangered. Thus anger arises without cause, and clever speech leads to partiality.

When beasts die, they do not choose their cries; their breath is labored, and in that moment, vicious thoughts arise together. If scrutiny is too severe, unworthy intentions will inevitably respond, though one does not realize it. If one does not realize it, who knows how it will end?

After discussing the transmission of words, this passage turns to analogies of such matters in the world—every sentence reflects human nature, which is the marvel of Zhuangzi. "Contending with skill and strength" refers to those who playfully wrestle today. *Yang* means joy, *yin* means malice. At first, they casually grapple, but in the end, they often come to real blows, for when play becomes excessive, there is much overreaching and cunning. *Strange* means unusual; *excess* means going beyond what is proper.

When people gather to drink, they begin with ritual—this is the orderly arrangement of the initial feast. *Disorder* refers to the clamor and uproar that follow. For when drinking becomes excessive, the revelry often turns strange, sometimes even leading to conflict. "All things are like this" means that other affairs in the human world are often the same. *Sincerity* means trust. When people first come together for a common purpose, they are always honest and trusting, but later, pettiness and deceit arise—this is another matter. What begins as a simple plan may, in the end, become a great affair.

The above speaks generally of the world, then turns to words and actions. For in human dealings, words are the source of wind and waves. *Wind on waves* suggests emptiness and chaos. Once the word *action* is spoken, there is name and trace; with a name, reality is lost. "Wind and waves are easily stirred" means they easily become tumultuous and unceasing. "Gain and loss are easily endangered" means that when reality does not match the name, harm may follow. *Without cause* means without reason—words of anger are often fabricated, arising without justification, hence "anger arises without cause."

Partial speech reflects a one-sided view—florid words are but a skewed account, hence "clever speech, partial words." "In death from joy, no sound is chosen": when one dies in silence, what sound would they select? This metaphor illustrates those who, in anger, craft clever words. Once contention arises, their speech pours forth without pause for selection—just as the common saying goes, "no kind words in a quarrel."

"Qi and breath become tangled": this is anger. "Harshness" means cruelty and ruthlessness. Once anger arises, a cruel heart is born alongside it. If I act thus, those who respond to me, pressed by my severity, will surely harbor unfilial thoughts. At times, it may even lead to mutual harm and destruction, all driven by anger without awareness. If one is moved by anger without self-knowledge, how could they pause to consider the end?

All the above speaks of worldly affairs, where good may turn to evil, thus drawing the discussion to this point.

*Sixth Scroll of the Oral Exegesis of the True Scripture of the Southern Florescence*
*By Lin Xiang of Yuanzhai*

Thus concludes the "Among the Human World" chapter of the Inner Scrolls. The *Fayan* states: "Do not alter decrees; do not urge completion—excess is but a craving for more. To alter decrees or urge completion courts peril; beauty is perfected in time, while ugliness forms too swiftly to amend. How could one not be cautious?

Moreover, riding the spontaneity of things to roam the mind, entrusting oneself to necessity to nurture the center—this is perfection. What need is there for contrivance in repayment? Better to deliver the mandate in full. This is the difficulty.

Here, the text once more invokes ancient words, concluding the matter of the envoy’s mission. *Ling* refers to the lord’s command: not to alter it is to transmit its unchanging essence. If, upon receiving the command, one privately schemes for success—even to the point of revising its intent—then the affair cannot be served. Whether it succeeds or not must be left to nature; one must not force its completion, hence the admonition: *do not urge completion*. *Yi* means seeking excess. To entertain thoughts beyond the ordinary mind is to harbor a craving for more—this is impermissible. *Guodu* (excess) is to transgress the usual measure, that is, to go beyond what is proper. Altering decrees or urging completion are both excesses of thought, and such schemes in affairs are bound to endanger them—hence *perilous matters*.

Human bonds of harmony are exceedingly difficult to forge; they cannot be achieved in a day but require enduring time to settle—hence *beauty is perfected in time*. Yet a single discordant word or a single unaccommodating act may instantly turn to enmity, leaving no room for amendment—hence *ugliness forms too swiftly to amend*. The meaning here is that turning to enmity is easy, while forging harmony is hard—thus one must be all the more cautious.

If I ride the natural course of things to let my mind wander in spontaneity, entrusting myself to necessity in response, nurturing the center with this intent—this is the utmost. Why then contrive repayment? *Bao* means returning the mandate. Contrivance is excess, a craving for more. *Zhiming* means delivering the lord’s command to Wei with sincerity. Your mission is best served by faithfully executing the lord’s mandate without overthinking success or failure. Even this—delivering the mandate in full sincerity—is a difficult feat. You must strive to fulfill it. Here, the text underscores the word *difficulty*, for navigating this is indeed hard."

Herein lies the meaning of "wandering within the drawn bow’s range, at its center"—the center being the central ground. This chapter is titled "The Human World" precisely to speak of the difficulty of navigating life. This passage exhaustively captures the nuances of worldly affairs; without Zhuangzi’s innate mastery of the Dao, how could one so thoroughly trace these intricate turns?

Some critics claim that Zhuangzi and Laozi saw only the subtlety of the Dao-mind while neglecting the peril of the human heart—such judgments are misguided, born merely of careless reading.

When Yan He was about to become tutor to the crown prince of Duke Ling of Wei, he sought counsel from Qu Boyu, saying: "There is a man here whose virtue is as if Heaven itself has undone him. If I indulge him without restraint, he will endanger our state; if I guide him with restraint, he will endanger me. His wisdom suffices only to recognize others’ faults but not his own—what am I to do with such a one?"

Qu Boyu replied: "Excellent question! Be vigilant, be cautious—first rectify yourself. In form, do not surpass closeness; in heart, do not surpass harmony. Yet even these two carry perils: closeness must not become intrusion, harmony must not become exposure. If in form you draw too close and intrude, you will meet ruin, destruction, collapse, or downfall. If in heart you harmonize too openly, you will invite fame, reputation, calamity, or disaster.

He may act like an infant—then act like an infant with him. He may cast aside all boundaries—then cast aside all boundaries with him. He may know no limits—then know no limits with him. Guide him thus into flawlessness."

Yan He sought instruction from Boyu because he was to serve as the prince’s tutor. "There is a man here" refers to the prince. "His virtue is as if Heaven has undone him" means Heaven has stripped him of discernment. *Undone* here suggests erosion, like frost withering grass—his nature has been worn away by creation. *Without restraint* means without principle; if he is left to his own devices, he will surely endanger the state, but if one attempts to correct him, the harm will first befall oneself. The prince’s cunning is just enough to see others’ faults but not his own—what can be done?

"Rectify yourself" means to begin by ordering your own conduct. *Closeness* means following and yielding; *harmony* means blending and guiding. Outwardly, adopt a respectful and yielding demeanor, while inwardly, maintain a heart of harmony and guidance—thus, "in form, do not surpass closeness; in heart, do not surpass harmony." *Do not surpass* means no method surpasses this.

Yet the text then takes a marvelous turn. *These two*—harmony and closeness—if you yield and become one with him, you overstep into intrusion; if your guiding heart reveals even slight sharpness, you overstep into exposure. To intrude is to lose oneself entirely, hence "ruin, destruction, collapse, or downfall." To expose oneself through fame or reputation invites his envy and harm, hence "fame, reputation, calamity, or disaster."

The phrasing here is most extraordinary. *Infant* describes one like an unknowing child; *without boundaries* describes one without restraint, reckless and unprincipled; *without limits* describes one who acts without considering consequences. Infant, without boundaries, without limits—all depict a person of reckless ignorance. If he is so unknowing and reckless, then follow his lead—thus, "act like an infant with him," "cast aside all boundaries with him," "know no limits with him." When he shows signs of awakening, enlighten him so that he may suddenly awaken, perhaps then entering a state of flawlessness. *Guide him* means to awaken him; *flawlessness* means without fault.

Once, Master Aixuan spoke of this: In Putian of old, there was a man who left his father unburied, squandered his fields and estate to indulge his desires. As his land neared exhaustion, his kinsmen pitied him and collected money to fund the burial. He feigned acceptance, then spent the sum as before. All his relatives grew indignant, until one clansman stepped forth to befriend him. He indulged the man’s every whim, drinking with him through the night until they reached the height of merriment. Then, patting his back, he said: *"Others may be overwhelmed by sorrow, but Yan Hui never alters his joy."* The man suddenly awoke, wept bitterly, returned home, buried his father, and ultimately became a good man. This is precisely the principle at work here.

Do you not know the mantis? It brandishes its arms to block the wheel-ruts of a chariot, unaware of its own incapacity—yet this is the very beauty of its talent. Beware, take heed: one who repeatedly boasts of his fine talents and provokes the world’s taboos courts peril. Do you not know the keeper of tigers? He dares not feed it living prey, lest its killing fury be aroused; nor whole carcasses, lest its tearing fury be provoked. He times its hunger and satiety, appeases its rage—thus the tiger, though of a different kind from man, fawns upon its keeper, for he follows its nature. To defy it is to invite death. Hence: *"Its killing comes from defiance."*

The lover of horses uses a bamboo basket for dung and a clay vessel for urine—this is true devotion. Yet when gnats and horseflies swarm upon the beast, and the groom fails to swat them away in time, the horse will snap its bit, shatter its bridle, and break the trappings of its head and chest. Love may run deep, but a single moment of anger can erase it all. Can one not be cautious?

Below are further parables. The mantis, trusting in the beauty of its talent, seeks to block the chariot’s ruts with its arms—this illustrates how petty talent, puffed with pride, meets great affairs and seldom avoids ruin. *Accumulated* means repeated; *boasting* means vaunting; *peril* means danger. One who repeatedly vaunts his fine talents and provokes the world’s taboos will surely endanger himself. Hence: *"One who accumulates boasts of his beauty courts peril."*

The tiger’s nature is quick to anger, so its keeper must soothe and dispel its rage. Even a tiger, though of a different kind, will fawn upon its keeper—this is nothing more than following its nature. To defy it is to be torn apart. Hence: *"Its killing comes from defiance."*

A *basket* is a bamboo vessel; a *clay pot* is a vessel of plaster. To use these for dung and urine is indeed devotion. But when gnats and horseflies gather on the horse’s body, and the groom fails to swat them away at once, the horse will snap its bit, shatter its bridle, and break the trappings of its head and chest. Its sudden fury obliterates all prior affection. *Groom* here means one who busily tends to the horse; *erase* is akin to *forget*. This shows how long-cultivated goodness can be undone in an instant, while evil takes root before one can correct it. Men may spend a lifetime in companionship, yet a single word can turn them into enemies—such is the difficulty of navigating the world.

Observe the passages on Lord Ye of Gao and Yan He, and you will see how this chapter, *"The Human World,"* clarifies these matters.

When Carpenter Shi traveled to Qi and reached Quyuan, he saw an oak tree used as a village shrine. Its girth could shade an ox, its trunk measured a hundred spans; its height rivaled the mountains, its branches only appearing after ten *ren*. A dozen or more of its side limbs could serve as boats. Spectators thronged like a marketplace, yet the master carpenter did not glance at it, walking past without pause. His disciple, having feasted his eyes, caught up to Carpenter Shi and said: *"Since I took up the axe to follow you, Master, I have never seen timber so magnificent. Why did you refuse to look, walking past without stopping?"*

*"Enough,"* he replied. *"Say no more."*

The tree is but a worthless timber—fashion it into a boat, and it sinks; make it into a coffin or outer casket, and it rots swiftly; shape it into vessels, and they shatter soon; set it as a door or gate, and sap oozes forth; raise it as a pillar, and worms bore through. It is a tree of no use, fit for nothing, and thus it attains such longevity.

Carpenter Shi returned home, and in his dream the oak of the village shrine appeared, saying: *"With what would you compare me? Would you liken me to those so-called 'fine woods'? Think of the crabapple, pear, orange, pomelo, and other fruit-bearing trees—once their fruits ripen, they are plucked and humiliated; their great branches break, their small branches are stripped bare. This is how their very usefulness brings suffering upon their lives. Thus they do not fulfill their natural span but perish midway. All things that strike and clash with the common world are no different. As for me, I have long sought to be of no use, and only now, on the verge of death, have I attained it—this is my great usefulness. Had I been of use, could I have grown so vast? Moreover, you and I are both things—how can one thing pass judgment upon another? And you, a worthless man on the brink of death—what could you know of a worthless tree?"*

Quyuan is the name of a mountain; *li* (oak) is the name of a tree. The shrine stood amid this oak. As the *Analects* says: *"The Xia dynasty used the pine, the men of Zhou used the chestnut"*—in ancient times, every village shrine was centered upon a great tree. *Xu* means to measure with the hands; two hands clasped together make one span. A hundred spans denote great girth; ten *ren* denote great height. If its branches could serve as boats, its trunk’s size may be imagined. *Yan guan* means to gaze until one is sated. *San mu* refers to a useless, discarded tree. *Ye gou* describes sap flowing copiously. *Shu* (pillar) means to erect a post as a column. *Wen mu* refers to trees that are pleasing to the eye and useful. The oak of the shrine appeared in Carpenter Shi’s dream, saying: *"You take me for a worthless tree—is this not comparing me to fine woods?"* The crabapple, pear, orange, pomelo, and other fruit-bearing trees are all fine woods fit for consumption, and thus they are broken and felled by men—this is how their usefulness harms their lives. *Neng* (usefulness) refers to usable talent. *"I have long sought to be of no use, and only now do you recognize it."*

The phrase *"nearly died"* refers to Carpenter Shi’s words—like calling someone a *"half-dead man"* today. *"That which makes me of great use"* means my uselessness is my greatest usefulness, the very reason I preserve my life. Had I been useful, men would have felled me long ago; how then could I have grown so vast? The particle *"且也"* simply emphasizes the preceding *"且"* with an added *"也."*

*"You and I are both things"*—though Carpenter Shi is human and I am an oak, we are both but one thing among all under heaven. Why then do you mock me as a mere thing? Thus it is said: *"You and I are both things—why then do you treat me as a thing?"* In a single sentence, four *"也"* and one *"哉"*—this is one of Zhuangzi’s most striking rhetorical flourishes.

*"You are a useless man yourself—why mock my useless wood?"* Hence the words: *"A nearly dead, useless man—how could he understand a useless tree?"* Carpenter Shi awoke and interpreted his dream.

His disciples asked: *"If you sought uselessness, why did it become a shrine tree? Why?"*

He replied: *"Silent as though speechless, it merely lodged there, enduring scorn as one misunderstood. Had it not become a shrine tree, would it not have been felled long ago? Moreover, what it preserves differs from the common—yet to praise it for its virtue is still far from the truth."*

The term *"诊"* means to divine. Upon hearing the words from his master’s dream, the disciples said: *"This tree’s aspiration—if it sought uselessness, why then must it be used as a shrine tree?"* *"密"* means *"you, keep silent."* *"彼"* refers to the oak. Its becoming a shrine tree was merely a lodging, never expecting that today it would be scorned and reviled by those who do not understand it. *"诟"* means to curse, *"厉"* to humiliate. Had it not become a shrine tree, would it not still have faced the axe? What it preserves differs from the common—yet to judge it by moral praise or blame is far indeed from the truth. *"所保"* means *"what it guards."*

*"且几有翦乎"*—here *"几"* carries the same sense as *"殆."* Nanbo Ziqi roamed the hills of Shang and saw an extraordinary tree. A thousand chariots could shelter beneath it, its shade so dense it concealed the rustling of the wind. Ziqi said: *"What tree is this? It must possess rare qualities!"* Looking up at its slender branches, he saw them gnarled and unfit for beams; looking down at its massive roots, he saw them split and unfit for coffins. Tasting its leaves burned his mouth; smelling it induced a three-day frenzy. Ziqi said: *"This is truly a useless tree—yet it has grown so vast! Alas, the spirit-like person preserves himself through such uselessness."*

In Song there was a place called Xingshi, where oak, cypress, and mulberry thrived. Those with trunks the span of a hand were felled for monkey perches; those three or four spans wide were felled for grand mansions; those seven or eight spans wide were felled for the coffins of the wealthy. Thus they never lived out their natural years but were cut down midway by axes—this is the calamity of being useful. Hence the *Jie* states: *"An ox with a white forehead, a pig with an upturned snout, or a man with hemorrhoids—none may be offered to the river."* The shamans knew this well, deeming them inauspicious. Yet to the spirit-like person, this inauspiciousness is the greatest auspice.

This passage echoes the previous one, though it further elaborates several points. *"见大木焉有异"* means *"a tree so vast it surpasses the ordinary."* Though a thousand chariots could shelter beneath it, its shade was so dense it concealed even the rustling of the wind—hence *"隐将芘其所藾."* *"饱"* refers to the tree’s self-sufficiency, *"藾"* to others seeking its shade. *"轴解"* means *"hollow,"* like the stem of a taro. *"咶"* (pronounced *shì*)—licking its leaves burns the mouth; smelling it intoxicates like wine, so foul is its odor. Yet precisely because it is useless, the tree preserves its life and grows so immense. The spirit-like person of old preserved his life likewise—through uselessness. Hence: *"the spirit-like person through this uselessness."*

*"嗟乎"* is an exclamation of admiration. *"荆氏"* is a place name. Oak, cypress, and mulberry are all useful trees. The previous passage spoke of edible trees; this one speaks of usable ones. *"宜"* means *"suited to the land."* *"杙"* means *"stakes,"* *"丽"* means *"roof beams."* *"高名"* refers to grand households—*"high and bright,"* where ghosts peer into the rooms. The two characters are synonymous, though *"明"* is pronounced differently. *"禅傍"* refers to coffin wood. Thus, in this land of useful trees, some were felled when their trunks were but a hand’s span, others at three or four spans, still others at seven or eight—none could escape. Only by being useful did they bring such disaster upon themselves.

*"解"* refers to an ancient divination text. It states: *"An ox with a white forehead, a pig with a high snout—neither may be used to sacrifice to the river."* In ancient times, humans were sometimes offered to the river, as in the case of Ximen Bao, hence the addition of *"a man with hemorrhoids."* Zhuangzi delighted in such peculiar details. *"适"* means *"to go"*—none of these could be taken to the river for sacrifice. Though the shamans deemed them inauspicious, they did not realize that this very inauspiciousness spared them from slaughter. To the spirit-like person, this inauspiciousness is the greatest auspice.

Both passages speak of the difficulty of navigating the world: those who seek to distinguish themselves inevitably court disaster—hence these parables.

There was a man named Zhili Shu, whose chin rested on his navel, shoulders towered above his head, his topknot pointed skyward, his five viscera’s ducts protruded upward, and his thighs pressed against his ribs. By mending clothes and washing laundry, he earned enough to feed himself; by winnowing grain, he could provide for ten. When the ruler conscripted soldiers, Zhili waved his arms among them; when great labor was demanded, Zhili, citing his chronic illness, was exempted; when grain was distributed to the sick, he received three bushels and ten bundles of firewood. Though his body was deformed, he could still nourish himself and live out his natural years—how much more so one whose virtue is deformed?

*"支离"* describes a body in disarray, *"疏"* is his name. His chin touched his navel, his back was hunched, his shoulders jutted above his head. *"会撮"* refers to his topknot; the ducts of his five viscera all pointed upward due to his curvature. *"两髀"* means his thighs, which pressed against his ribs as his body bent downward. This depicts a man utterly disabled. *"挫针"* means sewing, *"治繲"* washing clothes—his means of survival. *"鼓荚"* means winnowing with a basket, sifting out the coarse to keep the fine grain, hence *"播精足以食十人,"* emphasizing his efficiency.

When the court summoned warriors and selected fighters, he thrust his arms among them, showing that none were chosen over him. Great labor refers to public works, yet he received no credit, for such tasks did not honor him. His merit was like that of the men of Jin in *Zuozhuan*, who built the altar at Si—though they assigned the work to the feudal lords, he was exempt from both military service and corvée, and further received grain and firewood due to his infirmity. This too was a way of preserving oneself through uselessness.

*"Zhīlí"* describes his virtue: the perfected person’s virtue is likewise deformed, for in uselessness lies its greatest use. This aligns with the meaning of the useless tree.

When Confucius traveled to Chu, Jie Yu, the madman of Chu, wandered past his gate and sang:
*"Phoenix! Phoenix! How your virtue has declined!*
*The age to come cannot be awaited, the age past cannot be recalled.*
*When the world follows the Dao, the sage achieves completion;*
*when the world loses the Dao, the sage merely survives.*
*In this present time, one barely escapes punishment.*
*Fortune is lighter than a feather, yet none know how to bear it;*
*disaster is heavier than the earth, yet none know how to avoid it.*
*Enough! Enough! To stand above others with virtue—*
*perilous! Perilous! To tread within marked lines.*
*Tangled brambles! Tangled brambles! Harm not my path;*
*my path winds crookedly—harm not my feet!"*

The mountain tree brings ruin upon itself; the fat of the lamp consumes itself in flame. Cinnamon is edible, so it is felled; lacquer is useful, so it is slashed. All know the use of what is useful, but none know the use of what is useless.

This passage, drawn from the *Analects*, is borrowed to mock the Confucian school. Since the age to come cannot be awaited and the age past cannot be recalled, having been born in this time as this person, one should remain obscure when the times are unworkable—those who stubbornly cling to the idea of saving the world are ignorant of the times. Thus it is said: *"Virtue has declined."* When the world follows the Dao, the sage may accomplish his work; when the world loses the Dao, the sage merely preserves his life. In this present time, an age of chaos, one counts it fortunate merely to escape punishment—how dare one seek anything more? Thus it is said: *"In this present time, one barely escapes punishment."*

To survive in an age of chaos by barely escaping punishment is a fortune as light as a feather, yet you fail to recognize it. *"Bear"* means to accept and possess. In a chaotic age, disaster that befalls the body often leads to execution—heavier than the earth—yet you fail to avoid it. The *Han Poems* says: *"Glory fades before the eye, while calamity looms large as a house."* This expresses the same idea.

*"Enough! Enough!"* is like saying *"Let it be!"*—to exalt oneself with virtue and stand above others is the path to disaster. *"Perilous! Perilous!"* means danger. *"To tread within marked lines"* describes self-imposed restraint, suffering as if walking within drawn boundaries. *"Yáng"* means brightness. Human nature is originally luminous, but if you lose your way and become confused, you will proceed in the world and suffer harm. *"Crooked retreat"* refers to evasion and compromise—unable to follow the true and straight path, you must twist and turn to avoid harm, which will inevitably injure your feet. *"Injure your feet"* means you cannot proceed.

The mountain tree, being useful, invites the axe’s ruin—it brings destruction upon itself. The fat of the lamp, being bright and useful, consumes itself in flame. Cinnamon is felled because it is edible; lacquer is slashed because it is useful. These are all parables of those who cannot conceal themselves, who seek worldly recognition and thus invite disaster. Thus it is said: *"All know the use of what is useful, but none know the use of what is useless."*

**Inner Chapters: The Token of Fullness of Virtue/Power**

*Jiang* means "to respond." What one possesses within can respond to what lies without. *Chong* means "full." When one’s virtue/power is full within, one responds naturally to whatever arises.

In Lu there was a limbless man named Wang Tai, whose followers were as numerous as Confucius’s. Chang Ji asked Confucius, “Wang Tai is a limbless man, yet those who follow him divide Lu equally with you. He stands without teaching, sits without discoursing—yet those who go to him empty return full. Is there truly a teaching without words, a shaping of the heart without form? What manner of man is he?”

Confucius said, “He is a sage. I merely came after him and have not yet gone to study with him. I intend to take him as my teacher—how much more should those inferior to me! Why limit it to Lu? I would lead all under Heaven to follow him.”

Chang Ji said, “Though he is limbless, he surpasses even you, Master—how much farther is he above the common man! If so, how does he employ his mind?”

Chang Ji was a disciple of Confucius. “Dividing Lu equally” means that half the people of Lu followed Confucius, and half followed Wang Tai. “Stands without teaching”: he stood with his disciples yet taught nothing. “Sits without discoursing”: he sat with his disciples yet said nothing. Those who went to him arrived empty, with nothing to perceive, but upon seeing him, they returned full of attainment. “Without form”: nothing to be seen. “Shaping of the heart”: the heart is moved and transforms of itself.

Chang Ji, seeing this, questioned Confucius in doubt. “He” refers to Wang Tai. “I merely came after and have not yet gone”: I wish to go see him but have delayed. “Even one such as I would take him as teacher—how much more others!” *Xi jia* means “why only.” “Lead all under Heaven”: I would guide all people to take him as teacher.

“Though he is limbless, he surpasses even the Master—how much farther is he above the common man!” Here, *wang* means “to surpass.” If he surpasses even the Master, he is far above ordinary people. “The Master” refers to Confucius; *yong* means “the common man.”

Confucius said, “Life and death are indeed great matters, yet they cannot make him change.” These five words—“Life and death are indeed great matters”—are a central thread in the *Zhuangzi*. The entire vast canon of Buddhism arises from these five words. This is what is meant by “Life and death are great matters—like saving one’s own head.”

“Cannot make him change” means that though the change of life and death is great, his heart remains unmoved and cannot be altered by it. *Cannot* means “is unable.” “Make him change” means to change along with it. This statement is attributed to Confucius, but it is Zhuangzi’s parable.

Those who criticize it as heterodox say that while other matters are not expounded, this one thing is studied all one’s life—this view is quite correct. Yet in Buddhism, it is precisely because the dull and deluded cling to torpor and cannot be transformed that they are frightened with this, so that they may do good. Though its teaching is flawed, its zeal for saving the world is earnest.

For us Confucians, we cannot but refute its doctrine, yet we should also understand its intent. It holds that for people, regardless of nobility or baseness, what they fear is death. Thus it uses this to coerce them onto the Way. Some say Buddhism fears death and thus pursues this teaching, but this misjudges its heart.

“Though Heaven and Earth collapse, he would not be lost with them.” He is certain of what is real and does not shift with things, commanding the transformations of things while guarding their origin.

“Heaven and Earth collapse” is an exaggerated expression for the destruction of the cosmos. *Lost* means “to fall.” Though Heaven and Earth collapse, he would not fall with them—just as in the earlier saying: “Entering water, he is not drenched; entering fire, he is not burned.”

Reading the *Zhuangzi* differs from the *Analects* and *Mencius*; its language often goes to extremes. This is its stylistic flourish—it does not truly claim that Heaven and Earth can collapse. *Certain* means “clear,” “thoroughly seen.” *Without pretense* means “real.” Such phrases display Zhuangzi’s mastery of diction and phrasing. To say “clear about what is real” would be clumsy.

“Does not shift with things” is the same as “cannot make him change” and “would not be lost with them.” “Commanding the transformations of things” means that the changes of the myriad things all receive their mandate from him—akin to the Chan saying, “When the mind is deluded, the *Lotus Sutra* turns it; when the mind is awakened, it turns the *Lotus Sutra*.”

*Origin* refers to the beginning of the myriad things. “Guarding their origin” means that what this person guards lies in the beginning of things—echoing the earlier idea of “that which has a beginning” and “that which has never had a beginning.” In the *Zhuangzi*, though *origin* is glossed as “beginning,” its meaning goes beyond mere beginning. Only by reading it thus does one grasp its subtlety. “Guarding their origin” is the whole substance; “roaming in their harmony” is its great function.

Chang Ji said, “What does this mean?”

Confucius said, “Viewed from what is different, liver and gallbladder are as distant as Chu and Yue. Viewed from what is the same, the myriad things are all one.”

Ordinary people do not know that the myriad things share a single origin. Even liver and gallbladder seem as distant as Chu and Yue. But knowing that they share a single origin, the myriad things are all one with me.

Observe how these two phrases deploy their language—opening and closing with such skill. Many later masters of prose have employed this mechanism, for the *Zhuangzi* not only expounds subtle principles but also excels in literary refinement, surpassing all other philosophers.

“If so, he no longer knows what is fitting for ears and eyes but roams his heart in the harmony of virtue/power.” Ears are fitting for hearing, eyes for seeing. Yet one who attains this no longer merely listens with the ears or sees with the eyes.

This is what Chan Buddhists call "the six senses originating from a single source." How can sound be observed? Yet we speak of "Observing the Sounds of the World"—though this is heterodox teaching, it carries profound meaning. The harmony of virtue/power is one with Heaven and Earth and the four seasons. This "harmony" is not the moderation of the *Doctrine of the Mean*. To read this text, one must possess a distinct perspective.

Things see their unity but not their loss—seeing the loss of a foot as one would discard dirt. "Things see their unity but not their loss" means perceiving the myriad things as complete, without excess or deficiency. The passage on Kui and the centipede embodies this very idea. This further inverts the dialogue between Gongwen Xuan and Jie Yu.

"Discarding dirt" means being like earth that falls away unnoticed. Changji said: "He cultivates himself through his knowledge. Attaining his mind through his mind, he attains his constant mind—how could things rank him highest?" "Cultivating himself" is self-cultivation. "Through his knowledge" means that with this discernment, one can cultivate the self. "Attaining his mind through his mind" means that with this conscious mind, one attains the original mind. The original mind and the conscious mind are not two things—this is merely how the phrasing unfolds. The intent is that all people possess knowledge and all possess minds; if one fully realizes them, one can cultivate the self and attain the mind—nothing extraordinary. Thus, it is called "attaining the constant mind." "Ranking highest" means esteeming. It does not say "esteem" but "rank highest"—this is why Zhuangzi’s prose is so extraordinary.

"Things" refers to people. Confucius said: "People do not mirror themselves in flowing water but in still water—only stillness can still the many." Flowing water and still water both serve as metaphors for the mind. The flowing cannot be stilled; only one who can still the mind is uniquely worthy among people. The multitude seek stillness through desire, but only this person truly attains it. Thus, it is said: "Only stillness can still the many." This line suggests that those who cannot settle their minds seek instruction from him, and he can teach them to find stillness. Yet how extraordinary are these six words!

This echoes the Chan saying: "Bring me your mind, and I will settle it for you." A student said: "I have sought my mind, but it cannot be found." The master replied: "I have settled your mind for you." This is precisely the meaning of this passage.

Endowed by earth, only the pine and cypress remain verdant through winter and summer; endowed by heaven, only Shun stands upright—how fortunate to rectify his own life, thereby rectifying the lives of all. Comparing the planted pine to Shun, and Shun to Wang Tai, it speaks only of what they received from heaven as uniquely distinct from the multitude, thus able to align their own nature and align the nature of others. Here, "life" is simply "nature."

Some may ask: How can Shun be compared to Wang Tai? To read *Zhuangzi* thus is to speak dreams before a fool. The proof of preserving one’s beginning lies in the substance of fearlessness. A single brave warrior charges into nine armies, seeking fame and trusting in himself—yet even he is thus. "Proof" means evidence, verification. "Preserve" means to guard, to hold fast to the initial word and find therein both evidence and verification. This single word "trust" unfolds into the next line. The word "substance" follows "fearlessness"—without this substance, one cannot but fear.

The "nine armies" refer to a multitude of soldiers. Perhaps in the Warring States period, there were formations of nine ranks—this is not necessarily bound by the conventions of the Son of Heaven’s six armies or the feudal lords’ three. "Trusting in himself" means self-assurance. Men like Jing Ke and Nie Zheng sought fame through self-trust. They held fast to this single trust, unwavering even in life and death—how much more so for one who embodies the Way?

This passage brings to mind those in Buddhist texts who sit upon coiled pythons or guard tiger dens—it is nothing but this substance of fearlessness. *Zhuangzi* saw such things firsthand; these are not mere allegories. How much more so for one who governs heaven and earth, gathers the ten thousand things, lodges in the six bones, models the ears and eyes, unifies the knowing of knowledge, yet whose heart never dies?

To "govern heaven and earth" is for heaven to cover and earth to bear, for heaven to generate and earth to complete—each fulfilling its office. "Gather" means to assemble. The ten thousand things assemble as they are gathered, embodying the idea that "heaven and earth are born with me, and the ten thousand things are one with me." Mencius said, "The ten thousand things are all complete within me"—this too is the meaning of gathering the ten thousand things, though the phrasing differs.

"Lodging in the six bones" means the six bones are but a dwelling for the self. "Modeling the ears and eyes" aligns with the idea of not knowing the proper use of ears and eyes. The eye models the eye yet does not stop at seeing; the ear models the ear yet does not stop at hearing—hence "modeling the ears and eyes." "The knowing of knowledge": the first "knowing" is pronounced *zhi* (wisdom), the second as *zhi* (knowledge). Wisdom is received from nature; knowledge is the function of wisdom. Because it is received from heaven, there is nothing it does not know—hence "the knowing of knowledge." The heart that perceives nothing is called dead.

He will choose a day to ascend and reach the farthest. People follow accordingly. How would he deign to treat things as affairs? "Ascend" means to rise; "reach" means to arrive. The annotations reading *jia* as *gu* or *xia* as *ha* are both incorrect.

He would not choose a day to reach the Way—this means he does not wait for a chosen day to ascend and arrive at the Way, for there is no time when he is not in the Way, which is to say the Way cannot be departed from for even a moment.

The reason people follow and study under Wang Tai is simply this—this "this" is emphatic. "To treat things as affairs": "things" refers to people. He would not deign to treat people as affairs. For people seek to study under him; he never seeks to teach them.

Shentu Jia, a man without feet, studied together with Zheng Zichan under Bohun Wuren. Zichan said to Shentu Jia: "If I leave first, you stay; if you leave first, I stay." The next day, they again sat together in the same hall on the same mat. Zichan said to Shentu Jia: "If I leave first, you stay; if you leave first, I stay. Now I am about to leave—can you not stay? Or is it that you have not yet [understood]?" Moreover, when you see one in office, you do not avoid him—do you consider yourself equal to one in office? Shentu Jia replied: "In the Master’s gate, are there truly those in office who act thus? Do you delight in your office and put others after yourself? I have heard it said: If a mirror is bright, dust does not settle; if it settles, it is not bright. To dwell long with the worthy is to be without fault. Now, what you seek most is the Master. Yet you still speak thus—is this not a fault?"

Zichan said: "Since you are already as you are, you still contend with Yao in goodness. By your virtue, are you not capable of self-reflection?" "If I leave, you stay; if you leave, I stay"—this was to avoid each other. Yet Shentu Jia did not keep to the agreement. "Not avoiding" means not yielding. "Equal" means the same. "One in office" refers to himself. He meant: If you and I go out together, you would be equal to one in office. "Putting others after" means putting oneself first. To put oneself first and others after is to value oneself and belittle others. With learning, one’s vision becomes broad. "Seek" means to pursue. You study under the Master to broaden your vision, yet you remain so narrow—is this not so? The phrase "seek most" is excellent. The four words "contend with Yao in goodness" are most striking—since you are already maimed, even if you could do good, could you be like Yao? "Self-reflection" means he does not measure himself.

Shentu Jia said: "Those who describe their faults and claim they ought not to have lost [their feet] are many; those who do not describe their faults and yet ought not to have kept [their feet] are few. To know there is nothing to be done and yet accept it as fate—only one of virtue can do this. Wandering within Yi’s drawn bow, the center is the target, yet to miss it is fate. Many are those with whole feet who laugh at my lack of feet. I would flare up in anger, but when I came to the Master’s place, I would return to calm, not knowing whether the Master had washed me with goodness. I have wandered with you for nineteen years, yet you have never known I was maimed. Now you wander with me within the form, yet you seek me outside the form—is this not a fault?"

Zichan, startled, changed his expression and said: "You need not speak further." "Describe" means to recount. Many recount their faults and claim their feet ought not to have been lost. Few do not speak of their faults yet ought not to have kept their feet. Only one of virtue knows that all things have their fate—how could man do anything about it? These three sentences describe three kinds of people. "Accept it as fate" means to follow fate. The passage about wandering within the drawn bow is most extraordinary—this is what the *Yi* means by "treading on a tiger’s tail." Laozi said: "My greatest trouble is that I have a body." In this life, every movement is a perilous moment. The *Yi*’s metaphor of the tiger’s tail is already striking, yet Zhuangzi speaks of Yi’s drawn bow. "Within the drawn bow" refers to the place where the arrow is aimed when the bow is drawn. None was a better archer than Yi, and the center of the drawn bow was where he could not miss—this is a metaphor for the world’s dangers. How much more so in the Warring States era was this saying apt? That one’s heart is fortunate not to be struck is a matter of fate.

The phrase "废然乃自失" expresses the sense of losing oneself entirely in such anger. "反" means to return—upon seeing the master, one returns, having lost all cause for anger. The word "洗" is particularly fine, suggesting that being taught the good Dao is like being cleansed without one’s awareness. The line "形骸内外" is most excellent, all of which is absent in previous texts. Those who praise it say it captures eloquence, much like the *Zuozhuan*’s remark about the people of Lu being quick-witted.

In Lu, there was a crippled man named Shushan Wuzhi, who came to see Confucius by hobbling after him. Confucius said: "You were not careful. Having already suffered such misfortune, what good does coming now do?" Wuzhi replied: "I was ignorant of what truly mattered and recklessly used my body, which is why I lost my foot. Now that I come, I still possess what is noble about the foot—my nature—and so I strive to preserve it. Heaven covers all without exception, and Earth bears all without limit. I took you, Master, to be like Heaven and Earth, yet how could I have known you would be like this?" Confucius said: "I am indeed narrow-minded. Why not come in? Let me share what I have heard." Wuzhi departed, and Confucius said to his disciples: "Take heed! Though Wuzhi is crippled, he still strives to study and make amends for his past misdeeds. How much more should those of complete virtue do so?"

Wuzhi later said to Lao Dan: "Is Confucius not yet a perfected person? Why does he persist in treating learning as a guest, seeking to be known for strange and marvelous feats? Does he not realize that the perfected person sees such things as shackles?" Lao Dan replied: "Why not simply let him see life and death as a single thread, the permissible and impermissible as one continuum? If he could cast off those shackles, would that not suffice?" Wuzhi said: "Heaven has shaped him thus—how could he undo it?"

"踵见" means to follow and meet. "不知务" means not understanding what truly matters. "尊足者" refers to one’s nature. The phrase "尊足" is strikingly apt—what is noble lies not outside the body. "宾宾" refers to a reverent demeanor, as Sima explains. "諔诡幻怪" simply means a love of fame. "己桎梏" means fame is a burden to oneself. "天刑之" means Heaven punishes him by withholding the Dao.

Zhuangzi uses Confucius as a mouthpiece, sometimes humbling him, sometimes exalting him—all is allegory. Yet in this passage, he says: "Though Wuzhi is crippled, he still strives to study and make amends for his past misdeeds. How much more should those of complete virtue do so?" This teaching is also beneficial to the world’s instruction. "Life and death as a single thread, the permissible and impermissible as one continuum" echoes the *Qi Wu* chapter’s idea of affirming what is affirmable and negating what is negatable.

Duke Ai of Lu asked Confucius: "In Wei, there is an ugly man named Aitai Ta. Men who live with him grow attached and cannot leave. Women who see him beg their parents, saying, 'I would rather be this man’s concubine than another’s wife'—and there are more than ten such cases. He never initiates, only harmonizes. He holds no lordly position to save people from death, no wealth to fill their bellies, and his ugliness shocks the world. Yet he harmonizes without leading, his knowledge does not extend beyond the four bounds, and both men and women gather before him. There must be something extraordinary about him. I summoned him to observe, and indeed, his ugliness shocked the world. Yet after less than a month in my company, I took notice of his character. Before a year had passed, I trusted him, and the state had no minister. I offered him the governance of the state. He responded listlessly, as if declining, yet when I pressed him, he accepted. I felt ashamed, but in the end, I entrusted him with the state. Soon after, he left me and departed. I grieved as if I had lost something, as if there were no one left to share joy in ruling the state. What manner of man is he?"

"恶人" refers to one whose appearance is ugly. "不倡常和" means he does nothing but harmonize. "无君人之位" means he holds no noble authority. "聚禄" means wealth. "望人之腹" means to fill their bellies—"望" means fullness, as in the full moon. Observe such phrasing: how could Zhuangzi’s brush ever be matched? "知不出乎四域" means his knowledge does not transcend the world. "雌雄合其前" means he is intimate with all things, like birds that do not startle. "闷然" means responding without intent. "泛" means without attachment. "寡人丑乎" means "I am ashamed." "授之国" means entrusting him with state governance. "恤焉若有亡" echoes the Han king’s lament of losing his right and left hands.

Confucius said: "I once traveled to Chu and saw piglets nursing from their dead mother. After a moment, they looked around in alarm and fled, for they no longer saw their mother in her and no longer recognized her. What they loved in their mother was not her form but what animated her form. Warriors who die in battle are buried without funeral ornaments, and those who lose their feet no longer cherish their shoes—both have lost their root. The palace women of the Son of Heaven do not cut their nails or pierce their ears. Those who marry remain outside the palace and are no longer employed. Even one whose form is whole is sufficient for this—how much more one of complete virtue? Now, Aitai Ta has not spoken yet is trusted, has no merit yet is beloved, and is offered governance with the fear he might refuse. He must be one whose talent is complete and whose virtue is unmanifest."

The piglet analogy shows that love and aversion do not depend on the beauty or ugliness of form. "眴若" means a startled appearance. "不得类" means no longer resembling what came before. "已" means oneself. It says they no longer see their mother in her former likeness, hence the two-part phrasing.

These are all instances where Zhuangzi wields his brush playfully. The theory that love depends on form—if judged by the standards of *mingjiao* (Confucian moral governance)—would be gravely culpable. How could this align with the ancient principle of "serving the dead as one serves the living," or the reluctance to let one’s kin perish in spirit? Such passages in his descriptions may overreach, yet one must not use them as strict measures, nor remain ignorant of their impropriety.

To be slain in battle without a funeral fan is not a proper observance of mourning rites. *Zi* means "to employ." The amputee feels no attachment to shoes, for external adornments have no place. This, too, illustrates that virtue resides within, not without. The palace attendants of the Son of Heaven do not trim their nails or pierce their ears, embodying the idea of preserving wholeness in form. Those newly wed are exempt from service, as recorded in the *Rites*—they "cannot be employed again," meaning they are not to be conscripted within the palace. This analogy of bodily wholeness serves to depict the meaning of complete virtue.

Duke Ai asked, "What is meant by *cai quan* (complete talent)?"

Confucius replied: "Life and death, survival and ruin, poverty and wealth, worthiness and unworthiness, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these are the vicissitudes of affairs, the workings of fate. They alternate before us day and night, yet even knowledge cannot trace their beginnings. Thus, they are insufficient to disturb harmony or enter the numinous storehouse. One who maintains ease, flow, and unobstructed joy—who allows day and night to renew without cessation, bringing springtime to all things—is one who meets each moment and gives rise to timeliness in the heart. This is called *cai quan*."

This passage culminates in the phrase *"cai quan de bu xing"* (complete talent and unmanifest virtue). Earlier, it was said that even life and death—so vast—cannot alter one’s constancy; here, it enumerates life and death, survival and ruin, poverty and wealth, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat to exhaust the point. This is where the text unfolds its full meaning. *Gui* means "to seek." These vicissitudes of affairs, these workings of fate, succeed one another day and night before our eyes, yet even the wise cannot trace their origins—one can only say they arise of themselves. "Insufficient to disturb harmony" means they cannot disrupt the harmony within the breast, echoing the earlier line "not to be altered by them." "Not entering the numinous storehouse" means they do not move the heart. *He yu tong* (harmony, ease, flow) form a single idea: *yu* means joy, *tong* means unobstructed. With the heart unmoved, one naturally attains harmony, ease, joy, and flow without losing *dui* (joy). This sentence is quintessential Zhuangzi. *He yu tong* may also be rendered as "all-pervading completeness," as seen in later chapters. "Day and night without cessation" means constant renewal without halt. *Que* means "to stop." "Bringing springtime to all things" means adapting to circumstances with joy. *Wu* refers to affairs. The word *chun* (spring) here aligns with *dui* (joy). "Meeting each moment and giving rise to timeliness in the heart" echoes the Buddhist sutra’s "abiding nowhere yet giving rise to the heart." *Jie* means "to respond," *shi* means "timeliness." Responding to affairs without bias or stagnation is called "giving rise to timeliness in the heart." *Cai* means "essence," as in Mencius’ "Heaven’s bestowed essence." *Cai quan* thus means "preserving one’s essential nature."

Duke Ai asked, "What is meant by *de bu xing* (unmanifest virtue)?"

Confucius replied: "Stillness is the fullness of water; it can serve as a model. Within, it is preserved, and without, it does not sway. Virtue is the cultivation of perfected harmony. *De bu xing* means nothing can depart from it."

Another day, Duke Ai told Minzi: "At first, I believed that by facing south as ruler of the world, holding the people’s guiding principles and grieving over their deaths, I had attained the utmost understanding. Now, having heard the words of the perfected one, I fear I lack substance, have treated my person lightly, and nearly lost my state. I and Kong Qiu are not lord and subject—we are friends in virtue."

*De bu xing* means virtue is nowhere visible. When water is still, it is level and can serve as a model. *Fa* means "standard." *Nei bao* means "preserved within," *wai bu dang* means "not swaying without"—this rephrases the earlier "mirroring still water." *He* is the harmony of the center. *Cheng* means "complete." To complete the harmony within one’s nature is the cultivation of virtue. *De bu xing* manifests through all things, meaning virtue is present everywhere, not confined to a single aspect—hence "nothing can depart from it." The phrase "holding the people’s guiding principles" is excellent, signifying the reins of governance. "Grieving over their deaths" means loving the people. How could Duke Ai "face south as ruler of the world"? These are all instances where Zhuangzi’s brush overreaches without restraint.

"Not lord and subject, but friends in virtue" shares the same intent as Mencius’ "befriending," both being allegorical and not to be taken literally.

Yinqi, Zhili, and Wu Shen advised Duke Ling of Wei. The duke delighted in them, yet when he looked upon whole men, their necks seemed frail. The man with a great goiter like a jar advised Duke Huan of Qi. The duke delighted in him, yet when he looked upon whole men, their necks seemed frail. Thus, virtue may excel while form is forgotten. People forget what should be forgotten yet remember what should not—this is called *cheng wang* (true forgetting).

*Yinqi* means a hunched back. *Zhili* describes a stooped figure. *Wu Shen* means lipless. Hunchbacked, stooped, and lipless—these are extreme deformities. *Jianjian* describes a slender, elongated appearance. *Weng āng da ying* refers to a large neck tumor. These two examples illustrate that human likes and dislikes do not lie in outward form. The deformed and tumorous men found favor with their lords, while whole men seemed inferior—hence "virtue may excel while form is forgotten," meaning one loves virtue and forgets form. "People forget what should be forgotten yet remember what should not" is an excellent couplet, echoing Mencius’ analogy of "one finger not matching others."

What may be forgotten is form; what must not be forgotten is virtue. *Cheng wang* (true forgetting) is genuine forgetting. To know form yet not know virtue—this is true forgetting.

Thus, the sage wanders freely, yet knowledge becomes a blight, restraint becomes glue, virtue becomes an attachment, and skill becomes trade. The sage does not scheme—why then employ knowledge? He does not carve—why then employ glue? He suffers no loss—why then employ virtue? He does not barter—why then employ trade? These four are the nourishment of Heaven. That which Heaven nourishes is Heaven’s sustenance. Having received the Mandate from Heaven, why then rely on man?

The sage’s wandering is what is meant by "the mind roaming in Heaven." *Zhi* (knowledge) is the use of wisdom in affairs. *Yue* (restraint) is self-discipline through ritual. *Gong* (skill) is technical ability. *Nie* (blight) is calamity. *Jiao* (glue) is mud, or fixation. *Jie* (attachment) is clinging to externals while forgetting the internal. *Shang* (trade) is commerce, like buying fame under Heaven. When the mind roams in Heaven, one realizes these four are all burdens.

The sage does not scheme in the world, so he has no use for knowledge. Without carving, he naturally aligns with principle, so he has no use for restraint. Guarding the internal and having no concern for the external, he has no use for virtue. Not seeking to sell himself, he has no use for skill. These four—no scheming, no carving, no loss, no bartering—are the nourishment of Heaven. Heaven’s nourishment is Heaven’s emolument, akin to Heaven’s nobility. Having received sustenance from Heaven, why rely on man? It is like possessing Heaven’s nobility yet not seeking man’s rank.

To generate circumstances in the heart through attachment—talent remains whole while virtue does not manifest. The knowledge of a single wisdom: in earlier passages, the three characters *jie*, *de*, and *zhi* were laudable, yet here they become pejorative. This shift in brushwork, unmoored from consistency, marks the text as heterodox.

One has the form of a man yet lacks the passions of a man. Having the form of a man, one mingles with others; lacking the passions of a man, right and wrong do not adhere to the self. How small and petty—thus belonging to man! How vast and great—thus completing one’s Heaven!

Hui Shi asked Zhuangzi: "Do men truly have no passions?"
Zhuangzi replied: "Yes."
Hui Shi said: "If a man has no passions, how can he be called a man?"
Zhuangzi said: "The Dao gives him his appearance; Heaven gives him his form. How can he not be called a man?"
Hui Shi said: "If he is called a man, how can he have no passions?"
Zhuangzi said: "This is not what I mean by passions. What I call having no passions is that a man does not allow likes and dislikes to internally harm his person, but constantly follows nature without augmenting life."
Hui Shi said: "If one does not augment life, how can one preserve the self?"
Zhuangzi said: "The Dao gives him his appearance; Heaven gives him his form. He does not allow likes and dislikes to internally harm his person. Now you expend your spirit externally, exhaust your essence, lean against a tree to chant, and recline on a withered catalpa to doze. Heaven bestowed your form upon you, yet you clamor about ‘hard and white.’"

This passage records the debate between Zhuangzi and Hui Shi. The lines beginning "One has the form of a man" are Zhuangzi’s usual words, which Hui Shi then questioned.

"Mingling with others" means belonging to the same kind as men. "Right and wrong do not adhere to the self" means being unperturbed in all circumstances, transcending right and wrong. "Completing one’s Heaven" means following Heaven as one’s companion. If a man can rise above right and wrong, unperturbed in all circumstances, then he follows Heaven as his companion, and his achievements are vast.

"Heaven gives him his form" means having physical existence. "The Dao gives him his appearance" means all things must have their principles. What I call having no passions is that a man does not allow the passions of likes and dislikes to internally harm his person. Where there is gain, there is loss; by constantly following nature, there is neither gain nor loss. To speak of excess and deficiency is to speak of illness. Augmenting life is the illness of excess. When likes and dislikes arise from nature without attachment, there is neither loss nor gain.

Hui Shi said, "If one does not augment life, how can one preserve the self?"—taking augmentation of life as the means to sustain life, which was not Zhuangzi’s intent. Zhuangzi and Hui Shi were the closest of friends. Hui Shi was broadly learned and fond of debate, so Zhuangzi mocked him for expending his spirit externally and exhausting his essence.

"Expending spirit externally" means the spirit is used outside, like failing to keep it settled. *Gaowu* (withered catalpa) refers to using a dried tree as a desk. *Min* means weariness. *Jianbai* (hard and white) is the name of a debate. *Xuan* means bestowed. Heaven bestowed your form upon you, yet you torment yourself thus—why? The single word "clamor" inspired Han Yu to compose an entire preface. With such marvels, how could Zhuangzi not be a master of prose?

**The Great and Venerable Master, Part One**

The Great and Venerable Master is the Dao. It is like saying the sage models Heaven, Heaven models the Dao, and the Dao models spontaneity. To know what Heaven does and to know what man does—this is perfection. To know what Heaven does is to know that it gives life. To know what man does is to use what his knowledge knows to nourish what his knowledge does not know, so that he completes his Heaven-appointed years without dying prematurely—this is the fullness of knowledge.

Yet there is a danger: knowledge depends on something else to be fitting, but what it depends on is not yet fixed. How do we know that what I call Heaven is not man, or that what I call man is not Heaven? Only when there is a true person is there true knowledge.

Man’s life arises entirely from Heaven, and so it is called what Heaven does. Yet living in the world, there are human affairs that must be fulfilled, and so it is called what man does. When human affairs are complete, Heavenly principle appears, and thus one uses what his wisdom knows to nourish what his wisdom does not know. Not exhausting oneself to harm life, one thus completes his Heaven-appointed years. Having known both Heaven and man, this is called the fullness of knowledge. These several lines are quite correct.

Yet from "there is a danger" onward, this turn is especially fine. Knowledge depends on something else to be fitting, but what it depends on lies outside. Sometimes one attains without seeking, sometimes one must seek to attain—neither can be fixed. "Fitting" means settled. Only after a matter is settled does one see whether it is fitting or not. This single word "fitting" is most skillfully placed.

If one thinks it comes from Heaven, one must still seek to attain it; if one thinks it comes from man, there are things one seeks yet does not attain. This is what is meant by "how do we know that Heaven is not man, or that man is not Heaven?" For example, whether one lives long or dies young is all a matter of fate, yet it is also said, "One who knows fate does not stand beneath a crumbling wall." This shows that what Heaven does and what man does are not fixed. Zhuangzi’s insight into worldly affairs is most keen—such passages deserve careful reflection.

Only when there is a true person is there true knowledge. This refers to one who embodies the Dao. What is a true person? The true persons of old were not averse to scarcity, did not boast of success, and did not scheme for affairs. In this way, when they erred, they did not regret; when they succeeded, they did not feel self-satisfied. In this way, they climbed high without trembling, entered water without getting wet, and entered fire without feeling heat. Such was their knowledge’s ability to ascend to the Dao.

"Scarcity" means insufficiency. "Not averse" means compliance. When facing insufficiency, they simply accepted it. Though their achievements were great, they did not take pride in them. "Boast" means to brag. *Shi* (士) and *shi* (事) were interchangeable in ancient script. As in the *Odes of Dongshan*: "Do not *shi* the marching ranks." *Mo* means to scheme. They acted without intention, and so it is said they did not scheme for affairs.

"When they erred, they did not regret"—"erred" means to fail, like what is now called "making a mistake." "When they succeeded, they did not feel self-satisfied"—"succeeded" means to hit the mark, like what is now called "just right." When things succeeded, they did not feel self-satisfied or overly pleased. In all matters, whether failing or succeeding, they entrusted it all to spontaneity, not regretting failure or rejoicing in success.

"Climbed high without trembling, entered water without getting wet, entered fire without feeling heat"—this is to say there was nowhere they did not feel at ease. "Their knowledge’s ability to ascend to the Dao" means their insight deeply penetrated the Dao.

The two "in this way" phrases show Zhuangzi’s stylistic force. *Zhi* (知) and *zhi* (智) are the same. *Jia* means to reach. The true persons of old slept without dreaming, woke without worry, ate without relishing, and breathed deeply. The true person’s breath reached his heels, while ordinary people’s breath reached only their throats. Those who are cringing in speech sound as if they are retching. The deeper their desires, the shallower their Heavenly mechanism.

"Slept without dreaming"—their spirit was settled, which is what is meant by "the perfected person does not dream." "Woke without worry"—they engaged with things without contending in their minds. "Ate without relishing"—they had no desire to be full, which is what the Chan school calls "filling the hunger storehouse." "Breathed deeply"—the true person’s breath reached his heels, while ordinary people’s breath reached only their throats. This is the origin of the Daoist discourse on cultivation and nourishment.

When the spirit is settled, the breath that enters and exits is deep, rising from the heels to the mouth and nose, which is why there is the method of counting breaths. When the spirit is not nourished, the breath that enters and exits stops only at the throat. The difference between stillness and agitation is manifest in the body.

*Wa* means to spit. *Ai* means the throat. Without true insight, speech remains on the surface, and so one is easily cringing before others. This line, when examined alongside Chan inquiry, reveals the savor of Zhuangzi’s words. For example, what is called "frog Chan" only leaps once—this is the ease of cringing like retching.

"Desires" are human desires; "Heavenly mechanism" is Heavenly principle. "Deep and shallow" refers to what the elders called the waxing and waning of Heavenly principle and human desire in proportion. This passage, with each sentence forming a coherent thread, is the origin of both Daoist and Buddhist texts. It shows that this old master’s self-realization cannot be read carelessly. It is a pity that we do not see Dahui, Zhang Pingshu, and others discuss this with him.

The true persons of old did not delight in life or hate death. Their going forth was not joyful, their returning was not resistant. They came and went with ease, nothing more. They did not forget their beginning, nor did they seek their end. They received and rejoiced in it, forgot and returned to it—this is called not using the mind to harm the Dao, not using man to assist Heaven. This is called the true person.

This passage speaks only of life and death. "Going forth" is birth; "returning" is death. "Came and went with ease," "did not forget their beginning," "did not seek their end," "received and rejoiced," "forgot and returned"—all this is summed up in the two words "life" and "death."

Those who "do not resist" do not go against; it is the meaning of following with ease. "Not forgetting their beginning, not seeking their end"—this is what is called "tracing the origin and grasping the end," and thus they know the discourse on life and death.

Someone asked Master Zhaozhou, "Where will the Master go after a hundred years?" Zhaozhou replied, "After the fire burns, it becomes a single blade of thatch." This is not seeking their end. "Receiving" means receiving their form, which is bestowed by Heaven—how could they not rejoice in it? "Returning" means going back; they return whole and without attachment, hence it is said, "forgot and returned."

"Not using the mind to harm the Dao"—the mind is the Dao, and outside the mind there is no Dao. "Not using man to assist Heaven"—longevity and early death are fated, and human effort cannot add to it. These ten characters deserve careful reading. "Not harming" means not departing from it even for a moment.

If this is so, their will is steadfast, their countenance serene, their forehead broad and upright. They are chill like autumn, warm like spring; their joy and anger flow with the four seasons, harmonizing with things as they should, yet none know their limit.

"Will" means having a firm resolve. The meaning of the words in this text cannot be sought through the methods of the *Analects* or *Mencius*. The ancients said that the Buddhists, in speaking of nature, only speak of the mind—since they are already heterodox, how can one seek the meaning of our texts through theirs?

"Serene" means still. Facing the wall for nineteen years is where his countenance is serene. "Broad" means large; "forehead" is the brow. Because his head is held upright, his forehead appears broad. "Chill" is anger; "warm" is joy. Joy and anger without intent are like the four seasons of spring and autumn.

"Limit" is the point of cessation. "Things" are affairs. Responding to affairs, each finds its proper place, yet there is no fixed point of cessation—this is what is meant by "their mind moving with the times as they encounter them."

Thus, when the sage uses troops, he may destroy a state yet not lose the people’s hearts; his beneficence extends to ten thousand generations yet he is not partial to men. Using troops poisons the world; bestowing beneficence loves the world. Both are done without intent, so those whose states are destroyed do not resent it, and those who receive his virtue say, "What has the Emperor’s power to do with me?"

Our texts also contain this meaning. However, Zhuangzi’s brush, in its depictions, often goes too far. For instance, when he says, "His beneficence extends to ten thousand generations yet he is not benevolent," or "He kills the myriad things yet he is not righteous"—these are of the same kind.

Thus, one who delights in harmonizing with things is not a sage; one who has partiality is not benevolent. One who follows the seasons is not worthy; one who does not comprehend gain and loss is not a gentleman. One who pursues fame loses himself and is not a scholar; one who destroys himself without authenticity is not a servant of others.

Take Hu Bujie, Wu Guang, Boyi, Shuqi, Jizi, Xuyu, Ji Ta, and Shentu Di—they are servants of others’ servitude, following others’ paths, yet not following their own. These lines are mocking the sages and worthies to illustrate how the true person is beyond reach. The underlying meaning is that there are no true persons in the world, that none know the utmost Dao, and that from the sages downward, none—great or small—are genuine.

One who "delights in harmonizing with things" finds joy in the sage’s mind when not a single thing fails to find its place—"harmonizing" means finding its place. If one takes delight in this without bearing the vicissitudes of things, one is not a sage. Without intent, there is no near or far; to have near and far is to have intent, and having intent is not benevolence.

One who moves with the seasons knows the seasons of Heaven. To take this as ability is also not worthy. The gentleman can pursue gain and avoid harm, but if he cannot unite gain and harm as one, he is still not a gentleman. The scholar must seek fame, yet fame is the guest of reality—pursuing the guest, he loses himself, hence he is not a scholar.

"Authentic" means natural. One who does not know the natural and labors to the point of losing himself is a servant of others, not one who employs others. These are all excessive arguments.

Thus, from Hu Bujie onward—such as Boyi, Shuqi, and Jizi—they are all ridiculed as servants of others who have lost themselves, hence it is said they "do not follow their own path." Though the language is extreme, the writing is also marvelous.

Hu Bujie, Wu Guang, Xuyu, Ji Ta, and Shentu Di were all worthies of old. "Not following their own path" means not attaining their own fulfillment.

The true persons of old had a bearing upright yet not aloof, appearing insufficient yet not submissive. They were yielding yet not weak, expansive yet not ostentatious. They seemed joyful yet solemn, as if compelled. Their demeanor was imposing, their virtue restraining. They were stern as if worldly, yet untamable. They seemed fond of seclusion, yet their words were forgotten.

They took punishment as their body, ritual as their wings, wisdom as their timing, and virtue as their guide. "Taking punishment as their body" means they were lenient in their severity. "Taking ritual as their wings" means it was how they moved through the world. "Taking wisdom as their timing" means they acted only when unavoidable. "Taking virtue as their guide" means that, like one with feet reaching the hills, others truly saw them as diligent in conduct.

This passage of depiction has its refined and gentle aspects, but it is described too starkly. Buddhist texts contain many such examples.

Appearance is form, demeanor is bearing—righteous yet not partisan, standing centered without leaning. They seemed lacking yet did not humble themselves. "Bearing" implies submission and self-abasement, as in the *Zuozhuan*, where the deputy is called "the bearer." "In harmony" describes a relaxed bearing. "Flesh" refers to the corners of virtue. "Fleshy yet not firm" means possessing the corners of virtue without sharp edges. "Expansive" describes a state of ease and openness. "Vacuous" means being as if empty. "Unadorned" signifies substance. "Joyful" describes a pleased appearance, seeming glad yet not truly so. "Humbled" means lowered, suggesting that in engaging with the world and responding to things, there is an unavoidable reluctance, much like responding only after hesitation. "Clear" means gathered, a look of fullness and contentment—its vitality manifesting in the face, hence "advancing my countenance." "Restrained by my virtue" refers to what is called "the auspiciousness of an empty chamber." "Restrained" means to halt. "In harmony" describes a self-contented bearing. "Stern" conveys severity; though they appeared stern like worldly people, their inner truth held a humbled reluctance, hence "seeming worldly." "Vigilant" means great, unyielding to the world, hence "untamable." "Fond of seclusion" means unwilling to speak. "Joined" means united, dense—before speaking, they seemed reluctant to speak, and after speaking, as if they had not spoken, hence "forgetting their words with delight." These two phrases express the same idea. "Delighted" describes a lowered bearing.

"Body" means foundation. "Wings" means attachment. The sages say, "Illuminating the five punishments to assist the five teachings," whereas here it is said that punishment is the foundation and ritual the attachment—both are expressed in reverse. "Lenient in their severity" means that though they executed punishments, they did so with ease, without distressing their hearts. "Moving through the world" means following customs with ritual. "Timing" means employing wisdom only when unavoidable to respond to affairs. "Following virtue" means following the virtue of Heaven naturally, proceeding without effort, like one climbing a small hill—all who have feet reach the top, yet others assume they arrived through diligence. This is a metaphor for acting without contrivance. "Hill" refers to a small mountain.

Thus, their liking is one, their disliking is one. Their oneness is one, their not-oneness is one. Those who are one follow Heaven as their companion; those who are not one follow man as their companion. Heaven and man do not overcome one another—this is called the true person. "One" means naturalness, the workings of creation. "Liking and disliking" refer to preferences. Their oneness is sameness, their not-oneness is difference. The sameness and difference of preferences do not extend beyond creation, hence "their oneness is one, their not-oneness is one." If one can regard preferences as the same, they know Heaven. Thus, "those who are one follow Heaven as their companion." If one regards preferences as different, they know man but not Heaven. Thus, "those who are not one follow man as their companion." Man cannot overcome Heaven, nor can Heaven overcome man. The true person has no preferences, no differences, no sameness, no division between Heaven and man—only following nature.

This is what the Buddhists call "abandoning both existence and nonexistence," what Laozi calls "both returning to the mysterious." Thus, "Heaven and man do not overcome one another"—this means that both oneness and not-oneness are one. "One" is the great master.

Life and death are fate, possessing the constancy of night and day—this is Heaven. What man cannot intervene in is the nature of things. They regard Heaven as their father and cherish it, yet how much more should they cherish what is loftier? They regard having a lord as better than themselves and die for it, yet how much more should they cherish what is true? Life and death are like day and night, as the *Yijing* says: "Understanding the Dao of day and night." "Nature" means reality. What human effort cannot influence is the true principle of Heaven and Earth, of the myriad things—this is called fate, called Heaven. These lines elucidate the meaning of life and death as Heaven’s mandate, clarifying the idea of oneness and not-oneness.

Father and lord are the most revered and beloved in the human world, yet the greatness of the Dao surpasses even lord and father, hence it is said to be "the father of all fathers." Thus, "there is a true lord within." "Lofty" means high, unattainable. "True" means natural. These words imply that people know lords and fathers but do not know the Dao as the great master.

When springs dry up, fish find themselves on land, moistening one another with breath, wetting one another with foam—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes. Rather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, it is better to forget both and be transformed by the Dao. The great clod burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death. Thus, those who are good to my life are also good to my death.

"Moistening one another with breath, wetting one another with foam" means facing one another and sharing moisture. Being on land and wetting one another is not as good as forgetting one another in rivers and lakes—this metaphor means that acting in the world is not as good as embodying the Dao and practicing non-action. The line praising Yao and condemning Jie may seem absurd, but it reveals a unique insight. Without Jie, there is no Yao; without decline, no rise; without good, no evil; without slander, no praise. Praise and slander, rise and decline, good and evil all arise in mutual dependence. Rather than distinguishing between them, it is better to forget both and entrust them to nature—entrusting to nature is being transformed by the Dao.

The Buddhists say: "All dharmas are equal, without high or low." They also say: "Abandon both existence and nonexistence." And: "The great Dao is not difficult, only disliking discrimination." All these express the same idea.

Two clay oxen fight and plunge into the sea—no news of them to this day. This line is most excellent.

The great clod is heaven and earth. Only after form arises does life come to be; once born, one cannot be without toil. When old age comes and sinews and strength wane, one naturally finds repose. "Repose" means cessation. To "cherish our life" is to preserve our body whole. This is what is meant by "Hear the Dao in the morning, and in the evening death may come."

Hiding a boat in a ravine, concealing a mountain in a marsh—this is called secure. Yet in the dead of night, a strong man may carry them away, and the deluded do not know it. Even when concealing the small within the great is done fittingly, there is still escape. But to hide the world within the world is to leave no room for escape—this is the great truth of all things.

People delight in possessing human form, yet if one has human form, the myriad transformations have no end. How can their joy be measured? Thus the sage wanders where things cannot be pursued yet all abide.

To master early death, to master old age, to master beginnings, to master endings—even men emulate this, let alone that on which the myriad things depend and by which all transformations are sustained.

The boat in the ravine, the mountain in the marsh—these may be called securely hidden, yet at times they are lost. "In the dead of night, a strong man" refers to the workings of creation. "Carrying them away" is loss. It means that even when human plans are most deeply laid, there are times when one cannot act freely—this is like "forging iron to make a doorstep, where even ghosts clap their hands in laughter." The "deluded" are those who do not know.

"Small and great" refer to the boat and ravine, the mountain and marsh. A ravine large enough can hide a boat; a marsh large enough can hide a mountain—concealing the small within the great is fitting. Yet "escape" means loss. To hide the world within the world is to entrust it to nature. All that lies beneath heaven is entrusted to heaven, leaving no room for escape. This is the true and constant nature of all things.

People rejoice in having form, yet do not know that the human body undergoes a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations—how can one know where it will end? If one could know this, then the myriad things would all be complete within me, heaven and earth would be one with me, and how could their joy be measured?

The sage’s mind wanders in the natural, so there is no gain, no loss. Thus it is said: "He wanders where things cannot be pursued yet all abide."

To master early death, to master old age, to master beginnings, to master endings—this is the work of creation. "Master" means "to be able." If even creation can do this, men emulate it—how much more so the Dao, on which the myriad things depend and by which all transformations are sustained. This is what is meant by the "Great Master."

Each passage rises higher than the last—this is the style of Zhuangzi’s brush. The words of sages and worthies, by contrast, are plain and unadorned.

The Dao has essence and trustworthiness, is without action and without form. It can be transmitted but not received, attained but not seen. It is self-originating, self-rooted; before heaven and earth existed, it was already firmly established. It spiritually animates ghosts and gods, gives birth to heaven and earth. It stands before the Supreme Ultimate yet is not high; it lies beneath the six directions yet is not deep. It preceded the birth of heaven and earth yet is not ancient; it is older than high antiquity yet is not aged.

The earlier passage did not mention the word "Dao," but here it is finally introduced to speak of the Great Master.

"Essence" means reality; "trustworthiness" also means reality. "Without action" means there is no place to begin. "Without form" means it has no shape or bounds. "Can be transmitted but not received, attained but not seen"—these two lines are known only to those who understand the Dao. Guan Yinzi has a chapter that elucidates the meaning of "transmission" most aptly.

"Self-originating, self-rooted" means tracing back to its origin. Tracing the origin of this Dao, we find that before heaven and earth existed, the Dao was already present—this is what is meant by "the Supreme Ultimate without yet being the Ultimate."

"Ghosts" are the traces of creation; "Emperor" is like the "Emperor" in the *Yi* who emerges from the east. That ghosts and emperors can be spiritually potent is due to this Dao. Even heaven and earth exist only because of the Dao—thus it is said to "give birth to heaven and earth." The *Yi* says: "The Supreme Ultimate gives birth to the Two Modes"—this is the same idea.

The four lines—"not high," "not deep," "not ancient," "not aged"—are expressed with utmost clarity.

The "six directions" are the six directions of space.

When Fu Xi obtained it, he harnessed the mother of qi. The Northern Dipper obtained it and has never erred since time immemorial; the sun and moon obtained it and have never ceased since time immemorial. Kan Pei obtained it and thereby possessed Kunlun. Feng Yi obtained it and thereby roamed the great rivers. Jian Wu obtained it and thereby dwelt in the great mountains. The Yellow Emperor obtained it and thereby ascended to the cloudy heavens. Zhuan Xu obtained it and thereby dwelt in the Dark Palace. Yu Qiang obtained it and stood at the North Pole. The Queen Mother of the West obtained it and sat in the Lesser Expanse—none knew her beginning, none knew her end. Peng Zu obtained it and lived from the time of Youyu down to the Five Hegemons. Fu Yue obtained it and thereby assisted Wu Ding, ruling over all under heaven. He rode the eastern cord and mounted the tail of the Winnowing Basket, becoming equal to the ranks of the stars.

From Fu Xi onward, there are thirteen instances of "obtained"—all speak of obtaining this Dao and thereby achieving such things.

Fu Xi was an ancient emperor-king. "Harnessing the mother of qi" means harmonizing yin and yang within oneself—this is the origin of the practices of those who cultivate refinement. Kan Pei is a mountain spirit. "Possessing Kunlun" means having Kunlun. Feng Yi is a water spirit. Jian Wu is the spirit of Mount Tai. The Yellow Emperor’s ascent to the cloudy heavens refers to the affair at Mount Dinghu. The Dark Palace is like the present-day Pure True Realm. Yu Qiang is the spirit of the north. The Lesser Expanse is the dwelling of immortals.

The phrase "entering without knowing beginning or end" shares the same meaning despite variations in sentence length—this is a matter of literary technique. Among these thirteen sentences, the sun, moon, and Dipper are interspersed, and Peng Zu and Fu Yue are cited as later evidence. Such stylistic liberties transcend conventional rules; one cannot judge this by the standards of the sages’ writings but must regard it with a different perspective.

Nanbo Zikui asked Nü’ou, “You are advanced in years, yet your complexion is like that of a child—how is this so?”
“I have heard the Dao,” she replied.
Nanbo Zikui said, “May I study it?”
“Alas, how could that be? You are not the right person. Now, Bu Liangyi possesses the talent of a sage but not the Dao of a sage, while I possess the Dao of a sage but not the talent of a sage. I wished to teach him, hoping he might truly become a sage. Otherwise, conveying the Dao of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would be easy. I still guarded and instructed him: after three days, he was able to put the world outside himself. Once he had put the world outside, I guarded him again, and after seven days, he was able to put things outside himself. Once he had put things outside, I guarded him again, and after nine days, he was able to put life outside himself. Once he had put life outside, he could then attain morning clarity. With morning clarity, he could then perceive the solitary. Perceiving the solitary, he could then transcend past and present. Transcending past and present, he could then enter the state of neither death nor life. That which kills life does not die; that which gives life does not live. As a thing, it sends off all without exception, welcomes all without exception, destroys all without exception, and completes all without exception—its name is *yingning*. *Yingning* is that which is completed only after disturbance.

Nanbo Zikui said, “From whom did you alone hear this?”
She replied, “I heard it from the son of *Fumo*; the son of *Fumo* heard it from the grandson of *Luosong*; the grandson of *Luosong* heard it from *Zhanming*; *Zhanming* heard it from *Niexu*; *Niexu* heard it from *Xuyi*; *Xuyi* heard it from *Wou*; *Wou* heard it from *Xuanming*; *Xuanming* heard it from *Canliao*; *Canliao* heard it from *Yishi*.”

Zikui and Ziqi are both allegorical figures. To be advanced in years yet possess the complexion of a child—this is the teaching of present-day refinement cultivators. The distinction between “the talent of a sage” and “the Dao of a sage” is exceptionally well put; none but Zhuangzi could have said it, for no one before him had. Only those who possess both Dao and talent—aside from the Five Emperors and Three Kings—are Yi Yin, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius. The three, seven, and nine days need not be rigidly parsed; they merely signify one stage surpassing the next. “Putting life outside” means forgetting one’s own body. “Morning clarity” is the luminous state of the mind, like the sky at dawn, suffused with limpid qi. “Perceiving the solitary” means seeing for oneself what others cannot. Transcending past and present means transcending life and death. Here, “killing life” is said to be “not dying,” and “giving life” is said to be “not living”—this is a common flourish in Zhuangzi’s writing. It means that though one may kill, it is not death; though one may give life, it is not life. “Sending off” means escorting; without welcoming or sending off, without completion or destruction, it is simply the natural course. *Ying* means disturbance; though buffeted by turmoil and chaos, that which is constant remains undisturbed. *Ning* means stillness. Only after disturbance does one perceive this stillness—hence *yingning*. *Yingning* is the name that arises from disturbance.

The nine instances of “heard” are truly extraordinary. *Fumo* refers to writing. Words are first spoken, then recorded on bamboo and silk—hence *fumo* (supplementary ink). Speech is the rectification of form; writing is the ink’s supplement. *Luosong* means reciting by heart. One reads with the text before them and recites from memory, like a son begetting a grandson—hence the use of “son” and “grandson” below. *Zhan* means to see; seeing clearly is called *Zhanming*. *Nie* is the same as *nie* (to whisper); to affirm oneself in speech is called *Niexu*. *Yi* means to employ; *xu* means to await. One may await the right moment to act—hence *Xuyi*. *Wou* means to chant when words are insufficient; *yu* expresses admiration, signifying the joy of self-attainment. All these phrases suggest that the Dao is attained through reading, inventing many names along the way—an astonishing feat, yet ultimately ascribed to the workings of creation. *Xuanming* is the beginning of qi; *Canliao* is the beginning of the nameless; *Yishi* is the beginning before the beginning—what is called “having a beginning” is also “having a beginning before the beginning,” and “having a beginning before the beginning before the beginning.” This implies that though the Dao may be obtained through writing, it is in truth inherent in our nature.

*Southern Florescence True Scripture: Oral Exegesis*, Scroll Nine
By Lin Xi of Yuanzhai

Within the "Great Master" chapter of the Inner Chapters, Zisi, Ziyu, Zili, and Zilai spoke among themselves, saying: "Who can take non-action as the head, life as the spine, and death as the tailbone? Who understands that death, life, existence, and extinction are of one body? Such a one I would befriend." The four looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord, and so they became friends.

Soon after, Ziyu fell ill. Zisi went to visit him and said: "How mighty is the Creator! To make me like this—so crooked and bent!" His back was hunched, his spine curved, and five organs protruded from his upper body. His chin was sunken into his navel, his shoulders towered above his head, and his neck-growths pointed to the sky. The qi of yin and yang had fallen into disorder, yet his heart remained untroubled. He limped to a well and gazed at his reflection, saying: "Alas! The Creator has again made me like this—so crooked and bent!"

Zisi asked: "Do you resent this?"
He replied: "No. Why should I resent it? If, little by little, the Creator transforms my left arm into a rooster, I will use it to crow at dawn. If, little by little, my right arm becomes a crossbow, I will use it to hunt owls for roasting. If, little by little, my tailbone turns into a wheel and my spirit into a horse, I will mount it—why would I need another steed? Moreover, what comes to me is timely, and what leaves me is in accord with the natural order. To be at peace with the times and dwell in accord with the natural order is to keep sorrow and joy from entering the heart—this is what the ancients called 'suspended release.' Yet those who cannot release themselves are bound by things. Furthermore, things have never triumphed over Heaven for long—why should I resent anything?"

The head, spine, and tailbone signify only the beginning and end in sequence. "Nothingness" refers to existence arising from non-existence, and after existence comes life and death. "No resistance in the heart" means the heart naturally awakens, harmonizing and aligning with all. How grand is the Creator—this speaks of the vastness of transformation. "Bound and constrained" describes the state of illness. "Hunched" depicts a bent body. "Back carbuncle" is an ulcer. The "five orifices" are where ulcers emerge. The chin sinks to the navel, the shoulders rise above the crown—all portray the form of a diseased body. "Knotted bun" refers to a topknot. "Pointing to heaven" means the crown is exposed. When the yin and yang qi of the body fall out of harmony, illness arises—hence it is said, "there is disorder." Yet his heart remains untroubled, unburdened by his affliction. "Hobbling" describes the manner of being propped up and dragged along. Gazing at his reflection in the well, he sighs: "It is the Creator who has made me thus bound and constrained." "Do you resent it?"—this is Zi Si’s playful question. "Suppose" means "if." "Little by little" means "gradually." This passage is most extraordinary, and the phrase "little by little suppose" alone is strikingly unique. It suggests that if the Creator were to gradually transform my body into other things, I would simply make use of them—this embodies the idea of following the transformations of nature without preference or aversion. Though presented as a parable, it holds its own truth. "What comes is timely, what departs is in accord"—this echoes the earlier words: "Your arrival was timely; your departure is in accord." It also speaks to the principle of life and death. "Suspended release" means the heart is free from attachment. If one becomes entangled with things, one cannot free oneself—hence it is said, "those who cannot release themselves are bound by things." How could the myriad things ever long triumph over Heaven? All of this expresses contentment with the natural order, and the natural order of Heaven is the great master. Le Xuan once remarked that the thirty-two chapters of *Zhuangzi* revolve around the two words "nature" and "spontaneity."

Presently, Zi Lai fell ill, gasping as if near death, his wife and children gathered around weeping. Li went to visit him and shouted: "Away! Stand back. Do not startle the one undergoing transformation." Leaning against the doorframe, he spoke to him: "How grand is the Creator! What will it make of you next? Where will it send you? Will it make you into a mouse’s liver? Or an insect’s limb?" Zi Lai replied: "For a child, parents may send them east or west, north or south, and one follows their command. Heaven and Earth are to man no less than parents. If they approach my death and I refuse to heed them, I would be obstinate. What fault is theirs? The great earth burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death. Thus, to treat my life well is to treat my death well. Now, if a great smith were casting metal and the metal leapt up, saying, 'I must become a *Mo Ye* sword!' the smith would surely deem it ill-omened metal. Yet when one assumes human form and declares, 'I am a man! I am a man!' the Creator must surely deem them an ill-omened person. Now, if we take Heaven and Earth as a great furnace and the Creator as a great smith, where could one go and not be at ease?" Then he fell into a peaceful sleep and awoke refreshed.

When Master Zeng changed his mat, his words were as such—this is the learning of sages and worthies. Zhuangzi’s discourse here is that of a heroic spirit. "Shout" is the sound of rebuke; "stand back" means to send his wife and children away. "Startle" means to alarm the one undergoing transformation.

The rat’s liver, the insect’s arm—these speak of the tiniest of things, akin to the discourse of a single reed sprouting after Zhao Zhou’s fire has burned all away, yet its phrasing is extraordinary. "Only follow the mandate"—if I refuse to heed it, I am defiant and rebellious, echoing the earlier theme that things cannot overcome Heaven. The metaphor of casting metal is likewise singularly striking. Jia Yi said: "Yin and yang are the charcoal, the myriad things are the copper," all drawn forth from this crucible. If metal could speak, people would surely deem it monstrous. The Creator’s view of man is no different from the great smith’s view of metal—who but Zhuangzi could craft such parables? *Cheng* means "at ease"; *cheng ran* describes the state of slumber. *Qu ran* describes the state of waking. To take life as sleep and death as waking—these six words thus conclude the preceding passage, revealing the true marvel of the prose.

Zi Sang Hu, Mengzi Fan, and Zi Qin Zhang, the three friends, said to one another: "Who can join together in non-joining, act together in non-acting? Who can ascend the heavens and wander the mists, leaping and bounding without end, forgetting one another in life, without beginning or end?" The three looked at one another and laughed, their hearts in perfect accord, and so became friends.

After a time, Zi Sang Hu died. Before he was buried, Confucius heard of it and sent Zigong to attend to the rites. One wove a funeral mat, another strummed the zither, and together they sang in harmony: "Alas, Zi Sang Hu! Alas, Zi Sang Hu! You have returned to your true nature, while we remain as men." Zigong hurried forward and said: "May I ask—is it proper to sing before the corpse?" The two looked at each other and laughed: "What does he know of the meaning of ritual?"

"Joining together in non-joining" means to join without intent. "Acting together in non-acting" means to act without acting. *Nao tiao* means leaping and bounding. *Wu ji* means without end. "Ascending the heavens and wandering the mists" means to wander beyond things. "Forgetting one another in life, without beginning or end" is what was meant earlier by "not forgetting one’s beginning, not seeking one’s end." Where they spoke of "not forgetting," here they speak of "forgetting"—thus these eight words are but the five words "not seeking one’s end." *Mo ran* describes the vast and empty expanse; *you jian* means after a while.

Awaiting affairs is like assisting Yuan Rang in washing his staff. *Bian qu* refers to woven reeds used as markers. Some wove reeds, others played the zither—this refers to Mencius Fan and Zi Qin Zhang. *Yi* is an auxiliary particle. *Jie lai* are the opening words of the singer’s chant. "Returning to one’s true nature" means reverting to one’s origin. "I am still suspected by others" is like suddenly hearing the bells and drums from above, adding yet another day to this floating life. Such passages are among the text’s most striking. *Li yi* means the essence of ritual.

Though Zhuangzi speaks in parables, the *Book of Rites* records Yuan Rang’s "Badger-Head Song," showing that between heaven and earth, from ancient times, there have been those who practiced a learning of detachment from the world. Today, people say Buddhism first entered China during Emperor Ming’s reign, unaware that such people existed long before Buddhism.

Zigong returned and reported to Confucius: "What manner of men were they?" "They cultivated no conduct and treated their bodies as external things, singing before the corpse without change of countenance—what name could one give them?" "What manner of men were they?" Confucius said: "They wander beyond the bounds, while I wander within them. Outer and inner do not reach one another, yet I sent you to offer condolences—how shallow I am!"

"Those men roam as companions to the Creator, wandering in the single qi of heaven and earth. To them, life is an excrescent tumor, death the bursting of a boil. How could such as they know the priority of life and death? Borrowing from strange things, entrusting themselves to a shared body, they forget their liver and gall, disregard their ears and eyes, revolve through beginnings and ends without discerning head or tail. Vaguely they drift beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the work of non-action. How could they muddle themselves with worldly ritual to perform for the eyes and ears of the crowd?"

"Cultivating no conduct" means having no virtue or practice. "What name could one give them" means what could one call them. *Beyond the bounds* and *within the bounds* are like what Buddhists call worldly dharma and supramundane dharma. Their aims differ, and sending you to offer condolences was my mistake. Thus it is said: "Outer and inner do not reach one another, yet I sent you to offer condolences—how shallow I am!"

"Companions to the Creator" means befriending the Maker. "Wandering in the single qi of heaven and earth" means roaming in the primal state of creation. "Excrescent tumor" compares this body to a superfluous growth in heaven and earth, which must be burst and drained to bring relief—this is the meaning of "life burdens me, death gives me rest." "Borrowing from strange things" refers to the *Round Awakening*’s discourse on earth, water, fire, and wind; the four great elements combine to form the body, hence "entrusting themselves to a shared body." Even liver and gall, ears and eyes are not known to themselves—this is the meaning of "forgetting the body." "Revolving through beginnings and ends without discerning head or tail" means seeking the origin and end without finding the beginning. *Panghuang* means to drift and float. *Mangran* describes a state of unknowing. "Beyond the dust and grime" is the same as *beyond the bounds*. "The work of non-action" is spontaneity. *Kuikuiran* describes a state of self-inflicted confusion. Performing ritual for the eyes and ears of the world is mere self-delusion—this is Laozi’s meaning when he spoke of ritual as a forced imposition on the world.

Zigong said: "Then to what Way does the Master adhere?" Confucius said: "I am one punished by Heaven. Yet I share this with you." Zigong said: "May I ask what this Way is?" Confucius said: "Fish come together in water, men come together in the Dao. Those who come together in water dig ponds to secure their sustenance; those who come together in the Dao are without affairs and attain stillness. Thus it is said: Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes, men forget one another in the arts of the Dao."

Zigong said: "May I ask about the *qi ren*?" Confucius said: "*Qi ren* are askew among men but companions to Heaven. Thus it is said: Heaven’s petty men are men’s noble ones; men’s noble ones are Heaven’s petty men."

"What Way do you adhere to?" means: Does the Master follow the Way beyond the bounds or within them? "Punished by Heaven" echoes the earlier "condemned by Heaven—how could it be undone?"—meaning I cannot be a man of the Way beyond the bounds. "I share this with you" means I wish to speak with you of the joy of the Way beyond the bounds. "May I ask what this Way is" means "may I ask its reason?"

Fish gather in water, yet if they moisten one another with foam, it is not the same as forgetting one another in rivers and lakes. To dig a pond and keep them—though one may deem it sufficient—speaks only to having water, regardless of quantity. To attain the Dao is to live according to one’s allotted measure, to be still without affairs, for "without affairs" is "non-action."

The *qi ren* are those who are solitary—unique, set apart from others. *Mou* means "to align"; thus, the solitary do not pair with men but align with Heaven. What Heaven deems noble, men deem base; what men deem noble, Heaven deems base. In what Zhuangzi calls "noble ones," there lies a mockery of the sagely and worthy. For rites, music, laws, and measures do not arise from nature; only when scales are shattered and balances broken, when the people no longer contend, may one be called Heaven’s noble one. This is but a lofty discourse born of indignation toward a perverse world.

Yan Hui asked Confucius: "Mengsun Cai, when his mother died, wept without tears, felt no grief in his heart, and showed no sorrow in mourning. Lacking these three, yet praised for his mourning—does Lu indeed have those who gain renown without substance?" Hui had long marveled at this.

Confucius said: "Mengsun Cai has fully realized it; he has advanced in understanding. Though he sought to simplify, he could not—yet he has already simplified much. Mengsun Cai knows not why he lives, knows not why he dies, knows not what comes first, knows not what comes last. As if transformed into a thing, he awaits the transformations he does not know. And even as he is about to transform, how could he know it is not already transformed? Even as he is not transforming, how could he know it has not already transformed? You and I are but those who dream and have not yet awakened.

Lu values the reputation for proper mourning above all else. *Yi* means "constantly"; Hui had long been perplexed. "Advanced in understanding" means he has progressed, progressed to knowing the Dao. "Sought to simplify but could not" refers to mourning rites—such as weeping—he wished to cast aside but could not. Though he could not simplify, what he did was already quite simple, thus: "he has already simplified much." "Knows not why he lives, knows not why he dies" echoes the idea of reversal and recurrence, without beginning or end. "What comes first" is the beginning; "what comes last" is the end. He follows the transformations of creation, becoming one with things, awaiting the unknown transformations—this is to follow nature. *Yihu* is an emphatic particle.

Having followed nature, how could he know whether he is transforming, has transformed, or will not transform? Such are the stirring, soaring words of one who understands. He who knows the Dao and follows nature—yet I marvel at him—am I not the one still dreaming, not yet awake?

Moreover, he may be startled by form yet suffer no harm to his heart; he may dwell in a new abode yet feel no true death. Mengsun Cai merely awakens to others’ weeping and weeps in turn—this is simply how he is. "Startled by form" refers to the changes of body from youth to age; though such changes may astonish, his heart remains at ease, untroubled—thus "no harm to his heart." *Zhai* means "to dwell"; *dan* means "life." Life and death are like day and night. Knowing that life’s dwelling is temporary, death is not truly death—thus "no true death." *Qing* means "real." "Merely awakens to others’ weeping and weeps in turn" means he follows the crowd. This is where he wished to simplify but could not.

"This is simply how he is"—these six words are most extraordinary. Though he wished to simplify but could not, he nonetheless followed the crowd in weeping—this is the marvel of his self-attainment. This line is most difficult to parse, and in many versions, the *nai* of the previous clause and the *qie* of the following are combined, a pairing that is rather amusing.

Moreover, we are merely companions in this—how could we know what I call "I"? *Qie* here is simply *qie* with an added *ye*, as seen repeatedly in earlier passages. *Wu* means "I." Now, as we are together, I marvel at him through my own "I"—how could I know what this "I" truly is? Thus: "Moreover, we are merely companions in this—how could we know what I call 'I'?"

Zhuangzi’s writing often stirs and soars in this way; without a discerning eye, it is difficult to read.

Moreover, you dream of being a bird soaring to the heavens, or a fish diving into the depths. But how can we know whether the speaker now is awake or still dreaming? One’s intent may reach fulfillment before laughter arises; laughter may come before one can arrange it. To calmly accept what is arranged and follow transformation is to enter the vast oneness of Heaven.

The dreams of bird and fish reprise the earlier theme of the butterfly. "Is the speaker now awake or dreaming?" echoes: "Was it the butterfly dreaming of Zhuang Zhou, or Zhuang Zhou dreaming of the butterfly?" When intent is fulfilled, there may be no time for laughter—this speaks to the intensity of the moment. It is like Du Fu’s line: "Only when the shock subsided did I wipe my tears." Mr. Le Xuan also said: "By the time I could weep, the shock had already passed." Here, *zao shi* speaks to joy, as *jing* speaks to shock—though their emotions differ, the sense of "not yet" is the same.

* Pai* means "to arrange." Laughter arises naturally from things, as if things offer laughter to me—what need is there for arrangement? Thus: "laughter may come before one can arrange it." Though this *pai* and the *pai* below share the same character, their rhetorical force differs, and they should not be linked.

Between the workings of creation, all things are arranged: life and death, success and failure, fortune and misfortune—all are already fixed. If I but calmly accept what is arranged and follow transformation, only then may I enter the mystery of creation. *Liao tian yi* is but another name for creation. *Liao* means "vast."

The "One" of *Liao Tian* is what was previously called "its goodness," while the "One" of its "not-goodness" is also this "One." Here, Zhuangzi is merely playing with words, coining terms as he goes.

Yi’erzi went to see Xu You. Xu You asked: "How has Yao aided you?" Yi’erzi replied: "Yao told me, 'You must personally embrace benevolence and righteousness and clearly distinguish right from wrong.'" Xu You said: "Then why have you come here? Yao has already branded you with benevolence and righteousness and mutilated you with right and wrong—how will you wander the paths of carefree roaming, uninhibited freedom, and ceaseless transformation?" Yi’erzi said: "Even so, I wish to wander along its borders." Xu You said: "That will not do. The blind have no part in the beauty of brows and eyes, nor the deaf in the splendor of blue and yellow, embroidered patterns."

Yi’erzi said: "Wu Zhuang’s loss of beauty, Ju Liang’s loss of strength, and the Yellow Emperor’s loss of wisdom—all occurred in the space between the furnace and hammer. How do we know the Creator will not cease branding me, mend my mutilation, and let me ride perfection to follow you, Master?" Xu You said: "Alas, it cannot be known. Let me tell you its general outline. O my teacher! O my teacher!"

Embracing the myriad things yet not deeming it righteousness, bestowing blessings upon ten thousand generations yet not deeming it benevolence, enduring since high antiquity yet not deeming it age, encompassing heaven and earth, carving and sculpting all forms yet not deeming it artifice—this is the realm in which I wander.

What you possess is but instruction. To clarify right and wrong, to distinguish truth from falsehood—these are acts. "For" is an auxiliary word, as is "zhi." "Why have you come?" means "Why must you come?" "Branding and mutilation" besmirch you, as if to say you have been corrupted by such teachings. "Carefree roaming, uninhibited freedom, and ceaseless transformation" echo what was previously called "unfettered stirring, boundless wandering, and roaming beyond the dust and grime." "Carefree" means unbounded; "uninhibited" means unrestrained; "ceaseless transformation" means constant change. "Borders" refer to the fence. To say, "I dare not seek the inner chamber but only wish to reach the fence," is to express a desire to hear its general outline. The analogy of the blind and deaf that follows means you lack the capacity to comprehend the Dao.

Wu Zhuang was a beauty of old; Ju Liang, a paragon of courage. If you could embody the Dao and transform me, making the beautiful forget their beauty, the brave forget their strength, and the wise forget their wisdom—shedding old habits and awakening of your own accord—this would occur in the space between the furnace and hammer. "To ride" means to follow, to act in accordance with the perfection of nature. To cast off my former habits and act in accord with nature, serving you, Master, is to cease my branding, mend my mutilation, and let me ride perfection to follow you.

"Alas" expresses doubt. "It cannot be known" means I have yet to see if you can truly do this. The lines beginning with "O my teacher!" reveal the title of this chapter: *The Great and Venerable Teacher*.

Embracing and nurturing the myriad things yet not naming it righteousness, bestowing blessings upon ten thousand generations yet not naming it benevolence—this speaks of non-action that acts, of spontaneity itself. I harbor no deliberate intent, so such names do not apply. The *Yijing* says, "It stirs the myriad things yet shares no sage’s worries"—this is the same idea. "Enduring since high antiquity" means existing before heaven and earth. How can one who has endured for a thousand ages, for ten thousand ages, be named young or old?

Above, heaven covers with sun, moon, and stars; below, earth bears mountains, rivers, and hills—how much artifice is there! The heavens rotate leftward, the fixed stars cling to the sky and do not move, while the sun, moon, and five planets turn rightward, some swiftly, some slowly, some flowing, some hidden. The rivers, rocks, and waters—how many wonders! All are wrought by the Creator. Among the myriad forms, like the hundred grasses and myriad trees—how many marvels! What is this if not artifice? Yet it cannot be called artifice. These lines all describe the Dao of spontaneity.

To wander the mind in spontaneity is to see heaven and earth born together with me, the myriad things as one with me. Thus it is said, "This is the realm in which I wander," meaning this is where I roam.

Yan Hui said, "I have made progress."
Confucius said, "What do you mean?"
"I have forgotten benevolence and righteousness."
"That is good, but it is not yet enough."

Another day, they met again, and Yan Hui said, "I have made progress."
"What do you mean?"
"I have forgotten ritual and music."
"That is good, but it is not yet enough."

Another day, they met again, and Yan Hui said, "I have made progress."
"What do you mean?"
"I have forgotten myself in sitting."
Confucius started and said, "What do you mean by 'forgetting yourself in sitting'?"
Yan Hui said, "I cast off my limbs, dim my intelligence, leave my form, abandon knowledge, and merge with the Great Thoroughfare. This is what I call 'forgetting myself in sitting.'"
Confucius said, "To merge is to have no preferences; to transform is to have no constancy. You are truly worthy! I would follow after you."

This passage borrows the name of Yanzi to illustrate the subtleties of attaining the Dao, for even Zhuangzi in his time knew that Yanzi was second only to the sage. Yet the doctrine of "sitting in forgetfulness" belongs to Zhuangzi’s teaching—seeking it in Yanzi would be mistaken.

"Progress" here means gaining something. First benevolence and righteousness are forgotten, then ritual and music, implying that ritual and music are a step higher than benevolence and righteousness. For Zhuangzi, the terms "benevolence and righteousness" refer merely to love and aversion. All such meanings differ from those of the sages and worthies. First forgetting benevolence and righteousness, then proceeding to forget ritual and music, is like "setting aside the world, then all things." As for "sitting in forgetfulness," everything is forgotten entirely—this is the moment when both being and non-being are cast off, akin to the saying, "Now I have lost myself." The limbs and senses no longer know themselves, hence "casting off the limbs, dimming intelligence." "Leaving form" is casting off the limbs; "abandoning knowledge" is dimming intelligence. "Great Thoroughfare" is the Great Dao.

The sage is called "all-penetrating," and "penetrating" means "thoroughfare." Consider these two characters, "sitting in forgetfulness"—they form the same case as the Chan school’s "facing the wall." "To merge" is to become one with the Dao. Becoming one with the Dao means having no preferences; having no preferences means transformation; transformation means "no abiding, yet giving rise to the mind." Thus it is said, "To merge is to have no preferences; to transform is to have no constancy."

"To follow after you" means you surpass me, and I, falling short, stand behind you. "Worthy" means surpassing—surpassing the worthiness of others.

Ziyu and Zisang were friends. After ten days of ceaseless rain, Ziyu said, "Zisang must be ill." He wrapped rice and went to feed him. Arriving at Zisang’s gate, he heard sounds like singing, like weeping—plucking the zither, Zisang cried: "Father! Mother! Heaven! Man!" His voice could not sustain itself, and he hurriedly recited his verse.

Ziyu entered and asked, "Why do you sing your poem in this manner?"

Zisang replied, "I pondered who brought me to this extremity, but found no answer. Would my parents wish me poor? Heaven covers without partiality; earth bears without partiality. Would heaven and earth single me out for poverty? I sought the cause but could not find it. Yet here I am at this extremity—it is fate."

This passage speaks only of poverty and success as matters of fate, crafting such words in a most extraordinary way. Fearing Zisang might fall ill from hunger, Ziyu said he must be ill. In ancient times, playing the zither was always accompanied by song, as when Shun plucked the zither and sang *The South Wind*. "Like singing, like weeping" describes his strength failing, his voice faint. "His voice could not sustain itself" means he lacked the strength to project it. "Hurriedly recited his verse" refers to his distressed emotions constricting his words—his song lacked coherence, hence "hurried recitation." "Would my parents wish me poor? Would heaven and earth wish me poor?"—these lines are most exquisite. "I sought the cause but could not find it" means since it is neither heaven nor earth, neither father nor mother, then who is responsible? Yet what has brought me to this extremity is fate. This implies that the principle of spontaneity lies beyond heaven and earth. Fate is the principle of spontaneity—this is what is called the Great Master. Reading this chapter of *Zhuangzi*, one sees that *Liezi*’s "Power and Fate" falls far short.

**Inner Chapters: "Responding as Emperor and King"**

This chapter speaks of the Dao of emperors and kings, which must be thus in accord. Nie Que questioned Wang Ni four times, and four times received no answer. Thereat Nie Que leapt with great joy and went to tell Master Pu Yi.

Master Pu Yi said: "Have you only now come to know this? The Lord of Yu falls short of the Lord of Tai. The Lord of Yu concealed his benevolence to bind men to him—thus he gained men, yet never transcended the realm of the non-human. The Lord of Tai lay at ease, awoke in leisure; now taking himself for a horse, now for an ox. His knowledge was true to his nature, his virtue most genuine, and he never entered the realm of the non-human."

Four questions met with four answers of unknowing—this is the meaning of the *Vimalakīrti Sūtra*, where non-speech is the non-dual gateway. "Pu Yi" may also be read as "cloaked one." The names and figures in *Zhuangzi* are often fictive, like Master Wu You or Lord Absence—no need to dispute them.

Nie Que grasped the meaning of non-speech, hence his joy in telling Master Pu Yi. "Have you only now come to know this?" means "you have only now awakened." *Er* (而) means "you." The Lord of Tai was an ancient emperor, akin to the Lord of Great Court. *Cang* (藏) means "to harbor"; *yao* (要) means "to bind." To bind men’s hearts with benevolence is also a way to gain them. Yet this does not rise to the level of heaven—it merely keeps company with heaven. The "non-human" is heaven, hence "never transcended the non-human." "Never transcended" means "no more than this." To say "non-human" rather than "heaven" is but a flourish of his brush.

"Lay at ease" means tranquility; "awoke in leisure" means self-contentment. Now taking himself for a horse, now for an ox—all was left unquestioned, as if heedless of others’ judgments. What he knew was the true principle. *Qing xin* (情信) means "true in nature." His virtue was wholly natural. At this point, even "heaven" is insufficient to name it, for his spontaneity transcended even creation, hence "never entered the non-human." First "transcended," then "entered"—observe his choice of words. The Dao of emperors and kings lies in spontaneity alone; the title "Responding as Emperor and King" precisely conveys this.

Jian Wu met the madman Jie Yu, who asked: "What did Ri Zhong Shi tell you?"

Jian Wu said: "He told me that one who rules men must issue from himself the constant norms, models, and right principles to transform them. Who would dare disobey and fail to be transformed?"

Jie Yu said: "This is deceptive virtue. To govern the world thus is like crossing the sea by digging a river or making a mosquito bear a mountain. When the sage governs, he governs externally—acting only after rectifying himself. He is resolute in fulfilling his task, and that is all."

Moreover, birds fly high to escape the harm of arrows and nets, and field mice burrow deep beneath sacred mounds to avoid the peril of fumigation and digging—yet you are less wise than these two creatures.

Jian Wu first met Ri Zhong Shi, then Jie Yu, hence Jie Yu questioned him thus. *Jing* (经) means "constant"; *shi* (式) means "model"; *yi* (义) means "right principle in handling affairs." That the constant norms, models, and right principles issue from oneself means making oneself the model for the world. *Du ren* (度人) means "to transform men." To transform the world by modeling oneself is thus called "issuing from oneself the constant norms, models, and right principles to transform men." The phrasing of *jing shi yi* (经式义) aligns with "harmony and ease." *Du* is pronounced *du* (渡), "to cross."

"Who would dare disobey and fail to be transformed?" means the people would all heed and be transformed. "Deceptive virtue" means self-deception, not true virtue. To govern the world thus is harder than crossing the sea by digging a river or making a mosquito bear a mountain. "Digging a river" refers to dredging the Nine Rivers and the like.

"Governing externally" means transforming through the mind leaves no trace, while transforming through the body leaves traces. "Acting only after rectifying himself" means following the principles of nature and fate. "Fulfilling his task" means exhausting this natural course. *Que hu* (确乎) means "resolute"—his governance is resolutely thus. *Zhuangzi*’s thought centers on non-action, hence his teaching differs from that of the Confucians.

Birds fly high to avoid nets and arrows, and mice burrow deep to avoid fumigation and digging—this shows that those who leave traces are self-encumbered. If one cannot practice non-action and instead leaves traces, one’s ignorance is greater than that of these two creatures. The "two creatures" are the bird and the mouse. *Shen qiu* (神丘) means "sacred mound."

Tian Gen wandered to Yin Yang and came to the waters of Liao, where he encountered an unnamed man and asked: "May I inquire how to govern the world?"

The unnamed man said: "Begone! You are a vulgar man—why ask so inauspiciously? I am about to become a man with the Creator. When sated, I will ride the boundless bird to soar beyond the six directions and wander in the land of Nothing Whatever, dwelling in the wild expanse. Why trouble my heart with your questions of governing the world?"

He asked again, and the unnamed man said: "Let your mind wander in stillness, harmonize your qi with the vast, follow things as they are without imposing private ends—and the world will be governed."

To ask about governing the world is not the way of non-action, hence he deemed it a vulgar question and made me displeased. *Bu yu* (不豫) means "unhappy." "Becoming a man with the Creator" means dwelling in the human world while following the Creator’s spontaneity. *Yan* (厌) means "sated" or "full"—having had his fill of the human world, he would wander beyond creation. The "boundless bird" is the qi of emptiness. The "land of Nothing Whatever" and the "wild expanse" both refer to the realm of supreme emptiness. *He yi* (何帠) means "why." The annotation glosses *fa* (法) as *gu* (故), "reason."

To ask about governing the world stirred my heart—this is why I was displeased. The word *gan* (感) here means "to stir" or "to provoke." The character *yi* (帠), according to Master Cui, also carries the sense of "why." *Dan* (淡) means "serene and unadorned." *Mo* (漠) refers to the formless, empty expanse. *Qi* here is akin to *xing* (性, nature)—since this mind and this nature both align with spontaneity, it is said: "Let your mind wander in serenity, harmonize your qi with the formless." Earlier, it was said, "Do not listen with the mind but listen with qi"—here, *qi* should be understood as *xing* (nature). Follow the Creator’s spontaneity without imposing the mind, and the world will govern itself. Why must one take governing the world as a task? To act with intent is to introduce private bias.

When Tian Gen asked again, the Nameless Man answered him with words of truth. That he is called the Nameless Man shows that all the names mentioned before and after—such as those of fictitious figures—are like "Zixu" or "bird-that-is-not" (empty designations). Hence, later chapters speak of "parable" and "reiterated words." When names like the Yellow Emperor, Confucius, Yan Hui, or the Madman of Chu are invoked, it is to lend weight to the author’s own teachings. The "parable" refers to figures like the Nameless Man, Tian Gen, and Master Pu Yi.

Yang Ziju asked Lao Dan: "Suppose there were a man swift and strong in action, penetrating in understanding, and tireless in learning the Dao. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?" Lao Dan replied: "In the eyes of the sage, such a man is but a petty functionary, bound by skill and toil, exhausting his body and startling his mind. The patterns of tigers and leopards attract hunters; the agility of monkeys and the tameness of hounds bring them to the leash. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?"

Yang Ziju, dismayed, asked: "Then may I inquire about the governance of an enlightened king?" Lao Dan said: "The governance of an enlightened king: his achievements cover the world yet seem not his own; his transformative influence nurtures the ten thousand things, yet the people do not rely on him. No name is raised, yet things rejoice of themselves. He stands in the unfathomable and wanders in the realm of Nothing Whatever."

"Suppose there were a man..."—these words describe a certain person without naming him, subtly mocking Confucius. *Xiang ji* (向疾) means "swift and eager"; *qiang liang* (强梁) means "unyielding and vigorous"—referring to one who learns keenly and acts with determination. *Wu* (物) means "affairs"; *che* (彻) means "penetrating."

Those who speak of penetrating all affairs yet perceive with emptiness and clarity—*shu* (疏) means "emptiness." If one were to learn the Dao with such tirelessness, could this be compared to the governance of an enlightened king? This asks whether such learning constitutes the work of a true king.

*Xu* (胥) refers to convict laborers; *yi* (易) means "to change," akin to "taking turns in service." The term *xu yi* must have been an ancient expression, like the Han dynasty’s "ghost-firewood gatherers." *Ji xi* (技系) describes those bound by their craft and technical skills. These two types of people—those who take turns in labor and those shackled by their skills—exhaust their bodies and unsettle their minds through such learning. Their bodies toil and their hearts tremble, as if they were no more than convict laborers or craftsmen in bondage. *Chu xin* (怵心) describes a heart gripped by constant fear.

Tigers and leopards, with their patterned hides, attract hunters. *Ji* (藉) means "rope," the very thing that binds. The *li* (狸), or wildcat—along with dogs that seize them, and the agile monkeys and macaques—all invite the calamity of capture and restraint. Thus, any ability inevitably brings its own entanglement. The phrase "seizing the wildcat" also appears in the "Heaven and Earth" chapter.

If one were to govern through such active, worldly learning, then even tigers and leopards could be compared to enlightened kings—this is the harshest of rebukes. These three lines stand out for their striking phrasing.

"His achievements cover the world yet seem not his own" echoes the idea of "accomplishing without claiming." "His transformative influence nurtures the ten thousand things, yet the people do not rely on him" reflects the sentiment that "throughout the realm, none know whence it comes, nor what power the emperor wields." *Dai* (贷) means "to bestow," referring to the ruler’s transformative bestowal upon the people. The glosses for characters often follow tonal patterns—here, *dai* aligns with *shi* (施), both meaning "to grant." "Heaven bestows, earth produces; clouds move, rain is granted"—though the tones of *shi* and *dai* differ, their meaning remains the same.

"None can raise a name for what he possesses" means that no one can name his achievements, nor can the people find words to praise him. "Things rejoice of themselves" suggests that though no merit can be ascribed to him, all things find their own joy—much like Han Yu’s phrase, "people find their own contentment beyond the rivers and lakes."

"Unfathomable" means beyond comprehension, synonymous with "Nothing Whatever." "He stands in the unfathomable" is but another way of saying "he wanders in the realm of Nothing Whatever." The brush dances with such vitality throughout. These passages all expound the meaning of the "Responding to Emperors" chapter.

In Zheng there was a divine diviner named Ji Xian, who could foretell life and death, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early demise—his predictions, precise to the year, month, or day, were as if divine. The people of Zheng, upon seeing him, would flee in haste, but Liezi met him and was utterly enchanted. Returning home, he told Master Huzi: "At first, I believed your Dao was supreme, yet now I see there is something even greater."

Huzhi said: "I have shown you only its outward form, not its true substance—how then could you have grasped the Dao? A flock of hens without a rooster will never produce eggs. If you present the Dao to the world in such a manner, you will surely be believed. Thus, others can read your fortune."

Predictions of "years, months, or days" may be distant or near. A *shen wu* (神巫), or divine diviner, is one whose words prove true as if by magic. Those who "flee in haste" do so out of fear of his accuracy. "Enchanted in heart" means utterly convinced. "Having exhausted its outward form" refers to mastering only the external, while "not yet exhausted its true substance" means the inner truth remains untouched. *Er* (而) means "you."

You have never fully witnessed its true substance—how then could you truly claim to have grasped the Way? The word *gu* (固) implies mistaking partial attainment for mastery; consider its rhetorical force. Only with both male and female does generation occur—eggs are life itself. Without the male, how could there be eggs? This means that without the heart, no trace remains. This line illustrates that your heart has not yet transformed, so it may still be perceived through form.

*Kang* (亢) means "lofty"; if you elevate the Way above the world and demand others believe it, this itself is a trace, a sign of incomplete transformation. Thus, the divine diviner could read your fortune.

"Come again and bring him to me, that I may show myself to him."

The next day, Liezi brought him to see Huzhi. As Huzhi emerged, the diviner said to Liezi: "Alas! Your master is dead—he will not live, not even for ten days. I saw something strange: I saw damp ashes."

Liezi entered, his tears soaking his lapels, and told Huzhi what had happened. Huzhi said: "Just now, I showed him the *earthly pattern*—sprouting yet neither stirring nor settling. This was nearly my *blocked virtue-mechanism*. *Damp ashes* means his vital qi is nearly spent, like embers drenched and about to die out. *Earthly pattern* is akin to the meditative terms of Chan Buddhism, suggesting the faintest stirrings of life that are not yet life. *Not stirring* means unmoving; *not settling* means it cannot be pinned down or described. This *not settling* echoes Mencius’ phrase, 'There must be action, but do not fix it.' Only when there is the semblance of movement yet no movement does the diviner perceive *damp ashes*. Ashes are living fire; damp ashes imply living fire on the verge of extinction. *Blocked virtue-mechanism* is another meditative term: *virtue-mechanism* is the impulse of life, while *blocked* means closed off and unmoving. Thus, the appearance is of life about to fade, and Jixian concluded he would not live."

"Bring him again." The next day, Liezi brought him to see Huzhi once more.

Liezi emerged and said to Liezi: "Fortunate indeed! Your master has met me—he is recovering, fully alive. I saw his *blocked potential*."

Liezi entered and reported this to Huzhi. Huzhi said: "I showed him *Heaven and Earth*—names and realities did not enter, yet the mechanism stirred from the heels. This was the first glimpse of my *virtuous mechanism*. *Blocked potential* is movement within stillness. *Potential* and *mechanism* are the same, but the mechanism is subtle while potential is manifest. Within the blocked closure, the dynamic mechanism was revealed, so Jixian took it as full vitality."

"*Heaven and Earth* is also a meditative term: *Heaven* is the celestial field, the field above, not the *Earth* of soil, but the natural *Earth*—akin to how modern cultivators call the space beneath the tongue *Heavenly Ford* and the top of the head *Mud Pill*. This suggests the stirrings of life rising upward. *Names and realities did not enter* means both being and non-being are transcended. *The mechanism stirred from the heels* describes qi ascending from below, so subtle it cannot be seen—hence *mechanism*. *Virtuous mechanism* refers to the movement of inherent nature."

The next day, Liezi brought him to see Huzhi again. Upon leaving, Jixian said to Liezi: "Your master is unsettled; I cannot divine him. Let him settle himself, then I will divine him again."

Liezi entered and told Huzhi, who said: "I showed him *Supreme Vacuity, Unsurpassable*—this was nearly a glimpse of my *balanced qi-mechanism*. *Supreme Vacuity, Unsurpassable* is also a meditative term: *Supreme Vacuity* is the Great Void; *Unsurpassable* means it cannot be grasped. *Balanced* means level, half—when the dynamic mechanism of qi reaches equilibrium, it is half-moving, half-still. The spirit-diviner saw him as unsettled, for he was half-moving, half-still, and thus indeterminate."

"The *coiled leviathan* confirms the abyss, the *still water* confirms the abyss, the *flowing water* confirms the abyss. The abyss has nine names—here are three. *Coiled leviathan*, *still water*, and *flowing water* are all meditative terms. Modern Buddhists use *contemplation*, but the ancients called it *abyss*—just as Guanyin has twelve contemplations, the abyss has nine names. *Confirms* means truly. The *coiled leviathan* truly forms one contemplation, *still water* truly forms one contemplation, *flowing water* truly forms one contemplation. Only now does Huzhi reveal that what he showed the spirit-diviner were all these abysses. I have nine abysses, and I have shown only three—implying my subtleties are not yet exhausted. The character *confirms* is not *coiled*."

"The *Nine Abysses* in *Liezi* are complete, and Hong Yechu claimed *Liezi* surpasses *Zhuangzi*—this is hardly a sound judgment. If all nine abysses were fully explained, it would no longer be extraordinary prose. The art of leaving some things unsaid is precisely Zhuangzi’s marvel; only those who truly understand literature recognize this. This chapter originally had four sections, but the discussion of the nine abysses is woven into the fourth, demonstrating the art of expansion and contraction."

The next day, Liezi brought him to see Huzhi again. Jixian had not yet taken his stance when he lost himself and fled. Huzhi said: "Pursue him." Liezi chased him but could not catch up. Returning, he reported to Huzhi: "He has vanished, he is gone—I could not reach him."

Huzhi said: "Earlier, I showed him *Not Yet Emerged from My Source*. I met him with emptiness and compliance, so he knew not who or what I was. Thus, he took me for *crumbling reeds*, for *drifting waves*—and so he fled. *Vanished* and *gone* mean he could no longer perceive me. *Not Yet Emerged from My Source* is also a meditative term. *Emptiness* is the void; *compliance* is yielding. As if nothing, as if something—he knew not what I was, hence *he knew not who or what*. *Crumbling reeds* suggests collapse; *drifting waves* suggest boundlessness. Seeing me as formless, he saw only collapse and boundlessness—so he lost himself and fled."

Thereafter, Liezi returned home, believing he had never truly studied. For three years he did not venture out. He cooked for his wife, fed pigs as if feeding people, and took no personal interest in affairs. He carved and polished his faculties only to return to simplicity, standing alone like an unhewn block. Amidst the clamor, he remained bounded, ending thus.

"He cooked for his wife"—he took her place at the stove and did not leave. "Fed pigs as if feeding people"—his spirit gathered inward, and he saw no distinction. "Took no personal interest in affairs"—though he acted, he was unaware, as if not personally involved. He carved and polished his brilliance only to return to simplicity—this is what was earlier called "casting off the branches of the body and dismissing cleverness." "Stood alone like an unhewn block"—like a wooden figure. *Bounded* means having edges; *clamor* means excess. If his form was like a wooden figure, how could there be excess edges? "Ending thus"—he remained so for the rest of his life. *Thus* means always thus.

"Do not be a master of fame, do not be a storehouse of schemes, do not take on tasks as your burden, do not be a host of knowledge. Embody the boundless and wander without trace, exhaust what you have received from Heaven without seeking gain—be empty, and that is all. The mind of the perfected one is like a mirror: it neither advances nor retreats, responds but does not store, and thus can master things without harm."

Zhuangzi here exhaustively describes the practice of non-action. *Master* means to preside. Not taking fame as master is to *excel without approaching fame*. *Storehouse* means multitude. Earlier, he said, "Do not admire affairs, do not scheme—what use is wisdom?" This is the same idea. If one schemes intentionally, schemes gather here, and where schemes are possible, the mind has no use for them—hence *do not be a storehouse of schemes*. Though affairs cannot be avoided, one should not take them as a personal burden—hence *do not take on tasks as your burden*.

Though man cannot be without wisdom, he should not take wisdom as his master—hence the saying *do not make wisdom your master*. When the mind has a master, it becomes partial.

These four *no’s* serve as prohibitions, akin to the four *not’s* in the *Analects*. *To embody* means to perceive, to see. Seeing the Dao to its utmost without limit, the mind roams in the beginning of nothingness—hence *embody the boundless and wander without trace*. *Trace* means sign, beginning; *without trace* is thus *without beginning*.

Heaven endows me with this principle, and I exhaust it without claiming any gain—hence *exhaust what you receive from Heaven without seeking gain*. To see gain is to approach mere traces.

The Buddhist sutras speak of "awakening through illusion" in the same way. Having expounded thus far, he concludes with a single word: *empty*—this line carries great force. *Empty* is spontaneity, freedom from attachment.

When a mirror reflects things—beauty or ugliness, coming or going—it reflects of itself. It neither sends nor receives. *Sends* means to escort. It reflects forms and reveals forms, reflects things and reveals things—this is called *responding in the mirror*. Yet it never retains them, hence *responds but does not store*.

The mind of the perfected one is like this, so it remains unobstructed by things—hence *masters things without harm*. The Dao of Heaven does not contend yet excels at mastery—this is the meaning of *mastery*. These lines on the mirror clearly explicate the earlier *empty*. The rise and fall of the prose—is it not marvelous? Within its plainness lies divine artistry; such is this writing.

The Lord of the Southern Sea was Shu, the Lord of the Northern Sea was Hu, and the Lord of the Center was Hundun. Shu and Hu often met in Hundun’s land, and Hundun treated them very well. Shu and Hu plotted to repay Hundun’s virtue, saying: "All men have seven apertures for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing—only he has none. Let us try boring them for him." Each day they bored one aperture, and on the seventh day, Hundun died.

This passage simply illustrates how intelligence can burden the body. Thus, to cast off limbs and reject cleverness is to become Hundun. Though told in plain speech, the tale of boring one aperture each day is a stroke of genius.

Shu, Hu, and Hundun are all allegories; one must not cling to them literally, or one becomes like a fool recounting dreams. Hundun is primordial qi. The human body has seven apertures—like a newborn infant, whose ears, eyes, nose, and tongue exist but lack knowledge; this is the wholeness of Hundun. When knowledge begins to sprout, likes and dislikes arise—this is the boring of apertures.

Mencius said, "The great man does not lose the heart of a newborn infant"—this is Hundun unborrowed. Zhuangzi’s inversion renders it so strangely, yet the writing remains extraordinary.

Zhuangzi’s thirty-two chapters are divided into Inner and Outer sections. The seven Inner Chapters are each named with three characters, while those from *Webbed Toes* onward take only the first two or three characters of the opening line as their titles, following the example of *The Analects*’ *Learning* and *Governance*. The book makes no distinction of refinement; Inner and Outer Chapters speak in the same voice, merely arranged thus to inspire future generations.

Some Outer Chapters contain passages of sprawling prose, leading some to claim the Inner Chapters are refined and the Outer Chapters coarse—this is not so. Others attempt to explain the sequence of the seven Inner Chapters, saying: first one must *Wander Freely*, then *Equalize Things*; having equalized things, one should *Nourish the Life*; after mastering life-nourishment, one may *Roam the World of Men*; roaming the world, one draws all to oneself, hence *Signs of Full Virtue*; with inner virtue full and outer signs manifest, one becomes a teacher of men, hence *The Great Ancestral Master*; possessing this Dao, one may instruct emperors and kings, hence *Responding to Emperors and Kings*.

Though this interpretation holds, such rigid adherence lacks deeper principle and differs from the *Sequence of Hexagrams* in the *Book of Changes*. The true way to read Zhuangzi lies not here, but in grasping the momentum of the text itself—then boundless delight follows.

The most crucial part of any writing is its conclusion. In the seven Inner Chapters, each ends distinctively: *Wandering Freely* with *use and uselessness*, *Equalizing Things* with *the butterfly dream and transformation of things*, *Nourishing Life* with *fire transmitted*, *Signs of Full Virtue* with *hard and white cry out*, *Roaming the World of Men* with *"it is fate!"*

Each carries its own intent, and when all seven are complete, he contrives the tale of Shu, Hu, and Hundun, concluding with *"on the seventh day, Hundun died."* Observe his mechanism—is it not singular?

The *Doctrine of the Mean* begins with *"What Heaven imparts to man is called human nature..."* and ends with *"Only the utmost of the world’s Way leaves no sound, no scent"*—this too is a textual mechanism, though few perceive it thus.

Once, while attending my late teacher’s lecture on the *Spring and Autumn Annals* at the passage *"In the western hunt, a unicorn was captured,"* my teacher said: *"When it reaches its utmost, even the sage has what he does not know—hence he ended his brush here."* That night, as we strolled along the western veranda, he suddenly asked: *"How do you see the place where the unicorn was captured?"*

Xiyi replied: *"Applying the *Doctrine of the Mean*’s line about what the sage does not know—no other school has done this."* He added: *"The *Annals* begins with *'In the first year of the king’s reign'* and ends with *'In the western hunt, a unicorn was captured.'* Had there been one more line, the Master would surely not have recorded it."*

My teacher asked: *"How so?"*

Xiyi said: *"With such a conclusion, what more could be added?"*

My teacher made no reply and left. The hour was late, so he knocked at the gate of Uncle Qiu of Boyi and said: *"Master Su’s reading of the *Spring and Autumn Annals* is excellent. I and my friends have studied it for many years, yet none have matched this insight."*

Delighted by these words, he did not return until midnight. Two days later, Uncle Qiu of Boyi spoke of this to Xiyi.

*The True Classic of Southern Florescence: Oral Exegesis*, Scroll Eleven
By Lin Xiyi of Yuanzhai

**Outer Chapters: "Webbed Toes"**

Webbed toes and supernumerary fingers arise from nature, yet exceed in virtue. Wens and hanging warts arise from form, yet exceed in nature.

Those who employ the manifold methods of benevolence and righteousness arrange them among the five viscera, yet this is not the correct alignment of the Dao and virtue.

Thus, toes webbed together are but conjoined useless flesh; fingers branched apart are but limbs of useless digits. Those who apply manifold methods to the passions of the five viscera indulge in deviant practices of benevolence and righteousness, employing manifold methods in the use of hearing and sight.

The *mǔ* is the big toe; the *zhǐ* is the finger. *Pián* means "to join"; *zhī* means "to branch." What is born together with birth is called *nature*; what all humans equally receive is called *virtue*. Webbed toes and supernumerary fingers are both afflictions. Though they arise naturally, compared to what all humans equally receive, they are excessive—*excess* meaning surplus.

The meanings of *nature* and *virtue* here differ somewhat from those of the sages and worthies.

Wens and hanging warts are also afflictions. Webbed toes and branched fingers exist from birth, whereas wens and warts arise after form has taken shape. Thus, they are said to arise from form yet exceed in nature.

*Duōfāng* means "manifold methods"; *yòng zhī* means "to employ them externally." *Liè yú wǔzàng zāi* means they do not arise from within. They are not the natural expression of the Dao, hence they are said to be "not the correct alignment of the Dao and virtue."

Gaozi spoke of *yi* (righteousness) as external, while Zhuangzi went further, treating even transformation as external. He regarded benevolence and righteousness as excesses and perversions, grouping them with cleverness and acuity—all as teachings that fail to focus inwardly, hence appearing merely as "manifold affairs." *Duōfāng* here means "manifold affairs."

Thus, those who are *paired in clarity* disrupt the five colors, indulge in ornate patterns, and dazzle with azure, yellow, embroidered, and brocaded splendor—is this not so? And is not Li Zhu such a one? Those *excessive in hearing* disrupt the five tones, indulge in the six pitch-pipes, and revel in the sounds of metal, stone, silk, and bamboo, of *Huangzhong* and *Dalü*—is this not so? And is not Shi Kuang such a one? Those *branched in benevolence* pluck at virtue and obstruct nature to seize fame, driving the world to clamor like reed-pipes and drums in service of unattainable laws—is this not so? And are not Zengzi and Shishi such ones? Those *paired in disputation* pile tiles and knot cords, tamper with phrases, and roam their minds amid the debates of "hard and white" or "same and different," exhausting themselves in praise of useless words—is this not so? And are not Yangzi and Mozi such ones? All these are the ways of manifold pairings and branching excesses, not the ultimate correctness of the world.

The five colors, patterns, azure, yellow, embroidery, and brocade were in ancient times meant to nurture the eyes, yet Zhuangzi saw them as disruptive and indulgent. Thus, he spoke of being *paired in clarity*, echoing Laozi’s meaning that "the five colors blind the eyes." Li Zhu was one of clarity. If one deems such things incorrect, those of keen sight would consider them right—hence, "is this not so? And is not Li Zhu such a one?" The same applies to being *excessive in hearing*, for he regarded ritual and music as external things.

*Zhuó* means "to pluck"; *sè* means "obstructed," like overgrown thatch. Virtue and nature are inherently still, yet forcing oneself to practice benevolence is to pluck at virtue and obstruct nature. *Fǎ* refers to ritual laws; "unattainable" means what people find difficult to achieve. Compelling others to follow such difficult laws is to "drive the world to clamor like reed-pipes and drums in service of unattainable laws." *Huánggǔ* describes using words to deceive and stir others. Piling tiles and knotting cords are useless acts; the excessive words of disputers drag on endlessly, like unbroken chains with no meaning—hence the comparison to piled tiles and knotted cords. *Cuàndìng* means "to revise and fix," referring to refining phrases for debate, thus "tampering with phrases and roaming the mind amid 'hard and white' or 'same and different.'" *Bì* means "toil"; *kuǐ* is pronounced *qǐ*, meaning "to stand on tiptoe." Their words are useless yet praised with self-satisfaction, laboring in vain—hence, "toiling in tiptoe praise of useless words." If one deems this incorrect, the followers of Yangzi and Mozi would consider it right.

*Duō pián páng zhī* means "manifold pairings and branching excesses." The Way of nature is fundamentally without excess, yet these are all superfluous affairs, not the ultimate correctness. Ultimate correctness is the principle of inherent nature. Those who are *truly correct* do not lose the truth of their nature and life. Thus, what is joined is not called *paired*, what is branched is not called *excessive*, what is long is not called *surplus*, and what is short is not called *insufficient*. Therefore, though the teal’s legs are short, lengthening them brings sorrow; though the crane’s legs are long, severing them brings grief. Thus, what is long by nature should not be cut, and what is short by nature should not be extended—there is no sorrow to remove.

Does this suggest benevolence and righteousness are not human nature? Why do they bring so much sorrow? *Zhèng zhèng* means "naturally so." Being naturally so does not lose the true principle of nature and life. Though joined, it is not *paired*; though branched, it is not *excessive*; though long, it is not *surplus*; though short, it is not *insufficient*. These lines are deeply meaningful, echoing the earlier idea that "nothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small." *Qǐ* means "to rise." To rise is to be unbalanced, and unbalanced is to be ill at ease. Observe how precisely he chooses his words—how could it be casual?

"Long by nature" and "short by nature" mean length and shortness arise from inherent nature. Length and shortness are what nature finds comfortable—there is no sorrow to remove. The analogy of the teal and crane is most apt. *Yì* is like *āi*, an exclamation. Speaking of these two extremes, benevolence and righteousness are manifold—are they not contrary to human nature? Thus, he sighs and says: if benevolence and righteousness arose naturally, they would not bring such sorrow. "Much sorrow" refers to the toil of practicing benevolence and righteousness.

In making these remarks, Zhuangzi includes all from Confucius and Mencius back to Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang in his ridicule. As for those with *paired toes*, severing them brings tears; those with *branched fingers*, biting them brings wails. Whether surplus in number or deficient in number, their sorrow is the same. The benevolent of today gaze with half-closed eyes, grieving over the world’s calamities; the unbenevolent sever the truth of their nature and life to glut themselves on wealth and honor. Does this not suggest benevolence and righteousness are not human nature? From the Three Dynasties onward, why has the world been so clamorous?

Though *paired toes* and *branched fingers* are both afflictions, they cannot be forcibly removed—removing them brings sorrow. *Branched* means an extra finger, hence "surplus in number." *Paired* means two fingers joined and inseparable, hence "deficient in number." *Hāomù* means half-closed eyes; to close them yet not fully close them leaves the lashes tangled—hence, *hāomù*. *Hāo* refers to mugwort; *hāomù* conveys the sense of sitting alone in sorrow. This is how Zhuangzi chooses his words. Grieving over the world’s calamities and laboring oneself is the way of the benevolent; craving wealth and honor while destroying one’s nature is the way of the unbenevolent. Both are forms of self-suffering, hence he speaks of them together and sighs: are benevolence and righteousness not human nature? Seen thus, benevolence and righteousness are truly not inherent. *Xiāoxiāo* means "clamorous." From the Three Dynasties onward, this doctrine has flourished—why is it so noisy?

Moreover, those who rely on hooks, cords, compasses, and squares to correct things are *whittling away at their nature*...

Those who rely on cords, adhesives, and lacquer to secure things are *encroaching upon their virtue*. Bending and contorting oneself for ritual and music, cooing and murmuring for benevolence and righteousness to comfort the hearts of the world—this is to *lose one’s constant nature*. Nature is the spontaneous; virtue is what one naturally attains from Heaven. Neither is the work of human effort. If one must rely on cultivation to achieve correctness, then one is *self-mutilating*. Hooks, cords, adhesives, and lacquer are all metaphors for cultivation. *Encroaching* and *whittling away* are forms of self-mutilation; *securing* means fixing. To twist one’s body for ritual and music, to soften one’s words for benevolence and righteousness, seeking thereby to comfort the hearts of the world—all this is to lose the principle of one’s original nature, hence it is called *losing one’s constant nature*. *Cooing and murmuring* are like soothing and caressing.

There is a constant nature in the world. What is constant is this: the crooked do not rely on hooks, the straight do not rely on cords, the round do not rely on compasses, the square do not rely on squares, adhesion does not rely on glue and lacquer, and restraint does not rely on ropes. Thus, the world grows enticingly, all unaware of why it grows; all attain it alike, unaware of why they attain it. Therefore, from ancient times to the present, there has been no duality—it cannot be diminished. Then why must benevolence and righteousness cling like glue, lacquer, and ropes, wandering between the Dao and virtue, only to confuse the world?

The passage from *constant nature* onward shares the same meaning as *what joins is not forced into parallelism, what branches is not made to limp*. Crooked or straight, square or round, adhering or separating, binding or restraining—all should arise from spontaneity without human effort, for that is the correct principle. *Enticingly* is like *lushly*; when things grow lushly, who causes them to grow? What all things share in common—who grants it to them? It is all spontaneous. Hence it is said: unaware of why they grow, unaware of why they attain it. *From ancient times to the present, there has been no duality* means it is one and the same. *It cannot be diminished* means it remains unchanged from ancient times to the present, without any loss. *Clinging* means unceasing; *glue and lacquer* mean self-fixation; *ropes* mean self-restraint. To depart from one’s nature for benevolence and righteousness, pursuing them without end, is to become fixed and restrained—how then can one wander through the gate of the Dao and virtue? It only confuses the world.

Zhuangzi and Mencius were contemporaries. Mencius focused on transforming through righteousness, while Zhuangzi focused on the Dao and virtue. Thus, his writings consistently suppress benevolence and righteousness while discussing spontaneity, which has its own lofty subtlety—though his language often exceeds proper bounds. Generally, when Zhuangzi speaks of benevolence and righteousness, his terminology fundamentally differs from Mencius’s. Readers should recognize and distinguish this for themselves.

How do we know that minor delusion confuses direction while major delusion alters one’s nature? Ever since the Yu clan *promoted* benevolence and righteousness to *agitate* the world, none in the world have not *rushed to serve* benevolence and righteousness—is this not using benevolence and righteousness to alter their nature? Let us examine this. From the Three Dynasties onward, none in the world have not exchanged their nature for external things. The petty man sacrifices himself for profit, the scholar sacrifices himself for fame, the grandee sacrifices himself for his family, and the sage sacrifices himself for the world. Though these several types differ in their undertakings and their reputations bear different names, in harming their nature and sacrificing themselves, they are one and the same.

*Delusion* means confusion; *direction* refers to the four directions. Minor confusion reverses east and west, south and north; major delusion loses the nature of Heaven and Earth. The upper phrase is borrowed to illustrate the lower. *Promoted* is like what people today call a *signboard*—establishing the name of benevolence and righteousness to agitate the world, causing all to rush toward benevolence and righteousness, driven to serve it. Knowing benevolence and righteousness but not knowing the Dao and virtue is to exchange one’s nature for external things. The petty man sacrifices himself for profit, the gentleman for fame, the minister for his family, and the ruler for the world. *Sacrifice* means to follow, to forget oneself in pursuit of something. In Zhuangzi’s view, the world, the state, fame, and profit are all external things. To speak of the world and the state alongside fame and profit is to belittle the great and humble the lofty—this is common throughout his work.

The *several types* refer to the sages, grandees, scholars, and petty men mentioned above. Though their undertakings and reputations differ, in forgetting themselves and harming their nature, they are the same—all are losses from sacrificing to external things.

Zang and Gu were herding sheep together when both lost their flock. Asked what Zang was doing, he was found clutching a book and reading. Asked what Gu was doing, he was found playing games of chance. Though their activities differed, in losing their sheep, they were the same. Boyi died for fame beneath Shouyang, while Robber Zhi died for profit atop Dongling. Though their deaths differed, in harming their lives and nature, they were the same. Why must Boyi be right and Robber Zhi wrong? The world is entirely given to sacrifice.

Those who sacrifice themselves for benevolence and righteousness are commonly called gentlemen; those who sacrifice themselves for wealth and property are commonly called petty men. In their sacrifice, they are the same—some are gentlemen, some are petty men. But in harming their lives and nature, Robber Zhi is no different from Boyi. Then *how can one distinguish between gentleman and petty man*?

Gaming and reading—though one is base and the other noble, in losing their sheep, they were the same. This is an excellent analogy. *Clutching a book* means holding a scroll. *Gaming* refers to casting dice; *chance* means not casting dice. Dice are like today’s *shakers*—also called *teeth* or *pips*. *Chance* is the same as *gaming*. Zhuangzi was certainly not unaware of Boyi’s and Robber Zhi’s worthiness or lack thereof; he merely used them to make his point. These are all instances of his excess. Though gentlemen and petty men differ, in harming their lives and nature, they are the same. His aim was to criticize gentlemen, so he used petty men to illustrate them. This is another example of belittling the great and humbling the lofty.

Moreover, those who bind their nature to benevolence and righteousness—though as accomplished as Zengzi and Master Shi*—are not what I call *good*. Those who bind their nature to the five flavors—though as accomplished as Yu’er—are not what I call *good*. Those who bind their nature to the five sounds—though as accomplished as Music Master Kuang—are not what I call *keen*. Those who bind their nature to the five colors—though as accomplished as Li Zhu—are not what I call *clear-sighted*.

What I call *good* does not refer to benevolence and righteousness; it is goodness in one’s *power* alone. What I call *good* does not mean benevolence and righteousness; it is simply following the natural tendencies of one’s nature and fate. What I call *keen* is not hearing *that* but hearing *oneself* alone. What I call *clear-sighted* is not seeing *that* but seeing *oneself* alone.

For those who do not see themselves but see *that*, who do not attain themselves but attain *that*—they attain others’ attainments and do not attain their own, they follow others’ paths and do not follow their own. Those who follow others’ paths and do not follow their own, though they be Robber Zhi or Boyi, are equally excessive and perverse.

I am ashamed before the Dao and its *power*, and so above, I dare not practice the conduct of benevolence and righteousness, and below, I dare not engage in excessive and perverse actions.

*Binding one’s nature* means fixing one’s attention. *Zeng* refers to Zengzi, whose given name was Shen. *Shi* refers to Ziyu, whose given name was Qiu. Comparing Yu’er, Music Master Kuang, and Li Zhu to Zengzi and Master Shi is another instance of belittling the great and humbling the lofty. *Good* means excellence. Though they may be so, they are not what I consider excellent. Excellence in one’s *power*, following the natural tendencies of one’s nature and fate, is simply aligning with spontaneity.

Within these few lines—such as “what I call *keen* is not hearing *that* but hearing *oneself* alone,” and “what I call *clear-sighted* is not seeing *that* but seeing *oneself* alone”—lies the entire essence of the great canon. How could such words be casually uttered? Such expressions are uniquely profound and unmatched.

This word *that* cannot be lightly used. It is what Chan Buddhists call “a mad dog chasing a clod,” or “an illusory flower bearing an illusory fruit.” *Attaining one’s own attainment* and *following one’s own path* mean seeing and awakening to oneself. Generally, it is a matter of distinguishing between one’s original mind and external things. If one loses one’s original mind and chases after externals, all becomes excessive and perverse.

*Hearing oneself* and *seeing oneself*—if this were in my book—would be like the *Analects* saying “silently record it,” or the *Book of Changes* saying “silently complete it, without words yet trusted,” or Mencius saying “manifested in the four limbs, without words yet understood.” In the *Chunqiu Zhuan* preface by Master Yi Chuan, it says “leisurely immersion, silent recognition, and heart’s understanding”—all express this idea, though in plainer terms.

Huang Hui criticized Lu Xiangshan’s learning, saying that Jiangxi scholars all raised their brows and rolled their eyes, claiming enlightenment, which he vehemently condemned and refuted. Thus, in the *Collected Explanations of the Analects*, he glossed *record* (*zhi*) as “silently remembering it.” Mencius’ “without words yet understood” he also interpreted as “not needing others’ words to understand,” refusing to speak of sudden awakening. This was due to his cautionary stance, not the original intent of the *Mengzi* or *Analects*. Yet if we consider Master Yi Chuan’s words “silent recognition and heart’s understanding,” how could *zhi* mean merely “remembering”?

Still, for those who study the Dao, if during their practice they constantly harbor a mind waiting for enlightenment, it is even more impermissible. As the saying goes, “clinging to delusion while awaiting awakening is like being separated by Mount Sumeru.” Sudden and gradual awakening each have their own mechanism; one cannot say there is gradual but no sudden, nor must everyone attain it through sudden awakening.

Zhonggong’s *holding reverence* is gradual, while Yanzi’s *overcoming the self and returning to ritual* is sudden. Otherwise, why would it say, “In one day, overcome the self and return to ritual, and all under heaven will turn toward *ren*?” What is *ren*? To attain it in a single day—what is this if not sudden awakening?

Observe these lines: first, it raises the point that “overcoming the self and returning to ritual is *ren*,” then says, “In one day, overcome the self and return to ritual, and all under heaven will turn toward *ren*.” It further says, “*Ren* is from oneself—does it come from others?” The rising and falling cadence of the phrasing is just like Chan Buddhist dialogues. Only through careful reflection can one taste its flavor.

Once Yanzi grasped it in the words, he asked, “May I inquire about its details?” This is like the Chan saying, “How does one preserve and apply it?” The *Four Negations* and *Four Abstentions* are the means to *fully realize the mind, know one’s nature, and know Heaven*. What follows—*preserving the mind, nourishing one’s nature, serving Heaven, cultivating the self, and awaiting fate*—are the subsequent tasks. The statement “*Ren* is from oneself” is like the Chan saying, “In this matter, no one else can exert effort for you.”

Our late teacher once said, “Buddhist texts best verify our own; verification makes them easier to understand.”

Above, I dare not practice the conduct of benevolence and righteousness—this is *doing good without approaching fame*. Below, I dare not engage in excessive and perverse actions—this is *doing evil without approaching punishment*. *Dao and its power* mean spontaneity. I fear falling short of the Dao and its *power*, so though I do not engage in acts that approach punishment, I also do not engage in acts that approach fame. Approaching fame is not spontaneity. Thus, I say, “I am ashamed before the Dao and its *power*, and so above, I dare not practice the conduct of benevolence and righteousness, and below, I dare not engage in excessive and perverse actions.”

Observing Zhuangzi’s words here, how could he not be *rectifying the mind and cultivating the self*? His mockery of Yao, Shun, Confucius, Zengzi, Master Shi, and Boyi was never meant literally; it was merely the flourish of his brush.

Liu Shuping of Tangdong once wrote an essay titled *Zhuangzi and Lisao: Different Tunes from the Same Workshop*, saying, “Zhuang Zhou was a hero of pent-up indignation.” Master Lexuan greatly admired this phrase. It seems Zhuangzi, too, was indignant at a corrupt world before writing this book. His vision was lofty, his brush extraordinary—hence his excesses.

Sima Qian said of him: “He was skilled at weaving words and separating phrases, pointing to things and matching emotions, using them to strip away the Confucians and Mohists. Even the most learned scholars of his time could not escape his critique.”

The words flow vast and resonant—above like the deep tones of the ocean, below like the bleating of sheep—unrestrained and self-indulgent, perfectly capturing Zhuangzi’s spirit. In the "Horse’s Hooves" chapter of the *Outer Chapters*:

A horse’s hooves can tread upon frost and snow; its coat can shield against wind and cold. It grazes on grass and drinks from streams, lifting its hooves to gallop across the land—this is the true nature of the horse. Even if provided with grand halls and towering chambers, they would be of no use to it.

Yet when Bo Le declared, “I excel at managing horses,” he burned their hooves, trimmed their hair, notched their flesh, and bound them with halters. He tethered them with reins and hobbles, arranging them in rows within the stable, and already two or three out of ten horses perished. He starved and parched them, drove them to exhaustion, forced them into order and uniformity. Before them lay the torment of bits and bridles, behind them the threat of whips and spurs—by then, more than half the horses had died.

This passage speaks to how external things can burden the body.

“Lifting its hooves to gallop” refers to how a horse, when standing, will often raise one hoof—this is the meaning of the phrase below.

“Grand halls and towering chambers” refer to the palaces of kings. The character *yi* (義) here means “to nourish,” as in the saying, “Dwelling transforms the *qi*; nourishment transforms the body”—this must have been the original meaning of these two characters.

“Burning and trimming” refers to treating the horse’s hooves; “notching” means cutting, also applied to the hooves. “Binding” means restraining with halters. *Ji* (羈) refers to the headstall, while *zhi* (絷) means hobbling the feet—what is now called the “front and rear fetters.” “Arranging” means lining them up in order. The “stable” is the feeding trough, where horses are aligned in rows. “Order and uniformity” describe their disciplined formation. *Jue* (橛) refers to the bit, while “ornaments” are the reins and tassels beneath the jaw—hence the phrase, “the torment of bits and bridles before them.”

The horse is controlled by man and cannot delight in its own joy—this is why so many perish. This is akin to the great tortoise dragging its tail through the mud. Yet within these lines, the repeated use of *zhi* (之) and the phrasing of “two or three” before and “more than half” after create a texture as rich and dense as fine brocade. From this, countless brushwork techniques of past and present have sprouted.

Some say the “Outer Chapters” are crude in style—this is mistaken. The potter declares: “I excel at working clay; what is round aligns with the compass, what is square with the carpenter’s square.” The craftsman says: “I excel at working wood; what is curved fits the hook, what is straight follows the marking line.” Yet do clay and wood by nature desire to conform to compass, square, hook, and line? Still, generation after generation, people praise Bo Le for his skill in training horses and potters and carpenters for their mastery of clay and wood—this is the error of those who govern the world.

The potter works with clay; the craftsman with wood. Both clay and wood are shaped by human hands into vessels, just as horses endure burning, trimming, notching, and binding, forced to gallop in disciplined ranks—do they not lose the natural essence of earth and wood? People regard Bo Le and the potter-craftsman as capable, just as those from the time of Tai onward consider governing the world a skill.

Thus, the seven principles in the previous section run counter to human nature, and these few lines convey no deeper meaning—only the writing is refined. Yet in my view, one who truly governs the world well does not act thus. The people possess an inherent nature: they weave to clothe themselves and till to feed themselves—this is called shared virtue. Unified yet impartial, this is called “Heaven’s release.”

In the age of perfect virtue, their movements are unhurried, their gazes serene. At that time, mountains had no paths or tunnels, marshes no boats or bridges. All things flourished in their kind, bound to their native lands. Birds and beasts gathered in herds, grasses and trees grew unchecked. Thus, one could lead beasts by halters and wander freely, or climb to peer into the nests of crows and magpies.

In the age of perfect virtue, humans dwelled alongside birds and beasts, mingled with the myriad things—how could one distinguish noble from base? Alike in ignorance, their virtue remained unbroken; alike in desirelessness, this was called “pristine simplicity.” In pristine simplicity, the people’s nature was preserved.

Those of shared virtue receive it alike from Heaven. As humans live, each pursues their livelihood—some till, some weave—all according to the natural mechanism of Heaven. This is called “inherent nature,” the “constant thusness” spoken of earlier. *Dang* (党) means bias or partiality; pure and undivided, without favor or leaning, they roamed freely in the joy of nature—hence “unified yet impartial,” called “Heaven’s release.” *Ming yue* (命曰) means “is called.”

The “Heaven’s course,” “Heaven’s balance,” and “Heaven’s wandering” in the *Qi Wu Lun* are all names coined by Zhuangzi to depict the joy of nature. The “age of perfect virtue” refers to high antiquity. *Tian tian* (填填) describes a state of contentment.

"Dian dian" (颠颠) describes a fixed, unwavering gaze, portraying a person’s artless simplicity and absence of guile. This phrase is later echoed in *Ying Di Wang* (应帝王), where it depicts one who lies at ease and awakens unhurriedly.

Mountains had no paths or tunnels—routes were yet unopened. Marshes had no boats or bridges—waterways were yet uncrossed. People dwelled where they were born, forming natural bonds within their villages, with elders and juniors, superiors and inferiors linked in order. Beasts roamed in herds, deep in mountains far from human harm. Plants grew freely, untouched by axes. Men wandered with tethered creatures, climbed to peer into magpie nests—human and thing forgot one another.

Su Dongpo’s *Miscellaneous Notes* records his childhood home, where birds nested on low branches, and phoenixes visited the parasol trees every four or five days—a scene much like this, as noted in his *Collected Poems* (Volume 28, *Poem on the Strange Magpie*). From this, we see that high antiquity must have been thus: beasts could dwell alongside men, all things could gather together—where then was the division between noble and base?

*Zu* (族) means "gather"; *bing* (并), "together." *Wu zhi* (无知) means "unaware, unknowing"; *wu yu* (无欲), "pure in Heaven’s principle." The whole world was thus, hence "aligned in desirelessness." *Bu li* (不离) means "undivided, whole." *Su pu* (素朴) means "pure essence." In that time, each found joy in nature’s spontaneity—thus "in pure essence, the people’s nature was preserved."

That their virtue remained undivided is called "pure essence." These two phrases are interlinked, with the latter condensing the idea into "pure essence"—a technique of ancient prose. Modern writing lacks such artistry.

Yet when the sage strained and stumbled in pursuit of *ren* (仁, benevolence), stretched and strained for *yi* (义, righteousness), the world first grew doubtful. When boundless indulgence became "joy," and contorted postures became "ritual," the world first divided. Thus, if pure simplicity remained uncarved, who would fashion sacrificial vessels? If white jade remained uncut, who would shape ceremonial tablets? If the Dao and virtue remained intact, why seek benevolence and righteousness? If nature and feeling remained undisturbed, why impose ritual and music? If the five colors were not disordered, who would create patterned designs? If the five tones were not confused, who would devise the six pitch-pipes?

To carve simplicity into implements is the craftsman’s crime. To fracture the Dao and virtue into benevolence and righteousness is the sage’s error. Earlier, the text spoke of Bo Le; here, it speaks of the sage—this section responds to the prior one.

*Bie sa* (蹩躠) describes forced, halting movement; *di qi* (踶跂), restless standing or walking. *Chan man* (澶漫) means "boundless, drifting." *Zhai pi* (摘僻) depicts the use of hands and feet—*pi* (僻) is here pronounced like *sa* (躠). This passage unfolds from the contortions of ritual and music, the subservience to benevolence and righteousness—though the phrasing is unconventional, its style is striking. "First divided" means hearts and traces first diverged; once divided, purity was lost. Such uses of "divided" are particularly well-placed.

Vessels are carved from wood—hence, "if pure simplicity remained uncarved, who would fashion sacrificial vessels?" Jade must be cut to be shaped—hence, "if white jade remained uncut, who would shape ceremonial tablets?" The Dao and virtue are natural—Zhuangzi treats benevolence and righteousness as external, thus "if the Dao and virtue remained intact, why seek benevolence and righteousness?" Nature and feeling are innate—Zhuangzi sees ritual and music as forced upon the world, thus "if nature and feeling remained undisturbed, why impose ritual and music?" Mencius spoke of "ordering and adorning these two," of "delighting in these two"—such are the words of sages and worthies. In this text, the meanings of "ritual," "music," "benevolence," and "righteousness" differ, all deemed external things.

Patterned designs disorder the five colors; the six pitch-pipes confuse the five tones—both are metaphors for human artifice overriding nature. "The craftsman’s crime, the sage’s error"—these are the concluding lines of the preceding passage.

Horses, when left to themselves, graze on grass and drink water. When pleased, they nuzzle necks together; when angered, they turn backs and kick—this is all the horse knows. Yet when yokes and crossbars are fitted, when forehead plates are strapped on, horses learn to glare defiantly, twist their necks in resistance, rear fiercely, evade the bit, and steal the reins. Thus, the horse’s cunning and capacity for theft arise from Bo Le’s doing.

In the age of the赫胥氏, people dwelled without purpose, wandered without destination, played with food in their mouths, and roamed with bellies full—this was all they knew. But when the sage bent and twisted ritual and music to shape the world’s form, dangled benevolence and righteousness to soothe the world’s heart, the people first began to strain and strive for knowledge, to vie for profit without cease. This, too, is the sage’s error.

This passage condenses the earlier discourse into a few lines, adding several phrases—its strangeness only deepens. "When pleased, they nuzzle necks together; when angered, they turn backs and kick"—it is as vivid as a painted horse. *Xiang mi* (相靡) means "to rub against one another"; note how "nuzzle necks" and "turn backs" are rendered. *Heng e* (衡扼) refers to chariot fittings; *e* (扼) is the shaft. *Yue ti* (月题) is what we now call a forehead mirror. *Jie ni* (介倪) means "aloof, defiant"—standing alone, glaring in anger. *Yin e* (闉扼) means "to curve the neck and resist," refusing the bit and bridle. *Zhi* (鸷) means "fierce"; *man* (曼), "to charge"—the posture of resisting restraint and clashing headlong. *Gui* (诡) means "to scheme"; *qie* (窃), "to steal"—devising tricks to take the bit, stealthily applying the reins, all signs of a stubborn, untamed horse. Thus, when the bit and reins are applied, such cunning is required.

To "steal" is to oppose one’s master—when a horse’s cunning reaches the point of opposing man, it is Bo Le’s doing. Without yokes, crossbars, bits, or reins, horses would remain horses, men would remain men—where would one see their defiant, resistant postures?

When the people can cease from this, it means that the people’s conduct is limited to such behavior. *Kuang* (匡) means "to correct"—using ritual and music to rectify human form, employing benevolence and righteousness to console human hearts—all of which arise only after the sages have acted; in high antiquity, none of this existed. *Xianqi* (县跂) means "to raise high and lift up"; *diqi* (踶跂) means "to be ill at ease." The love of knowledge and contention over profit resemble a horse’s scheming to take the bit and stealthily applying the reins.

The Inner and Outer Chapters resemble the *Zuo Tradition* and *Discourses of the States*, all from a single hand—having completed the *Zuo Tradition*, the *Discourses of the States* were then composed, though their style differs from the *Zuo Tradition*. This chapter of the *Zhuangzi* is one such instance of expansive, luxuriant prose, and for this reason some have doubted it was written by Zhuangzi, but this is not the case.

**Outer Chapters: "The Robber’s Satchel"**

When one prepares defenses against petty thieves who pry open satchels, rummage through bags, and ransack chests—securing knots, fastening cords, and bolting locks—this is what the world calls wisdom. Yet when a great thief arrives, he hoists the chest upon his back, shoulders the satchel, and makes off with the bag, fearing only that the knots, cords, and bolts are not secure enough. Thus, what was once called wisdom is nothing but amassing spoils for the great thief.

Let us examine this: Is there any so-called wisdom in the world that does not serve to accumulate for the great thief? Or any so-called sagacity that does not stand guard for him? How do we know this is so?

In ancient times, the state of Qi had villages so close that the crowing of cocks and barking of dogs could be heard from one to the next. The land where nets were cast and plows turned spanned over two thousand *li*, encompassing all within its four borders. In establishing ancestral temples and altars to the soil and grain, in governing towns, districts, and hamlets—was there ever a time they did not model themselves on the sages? Yet Tian Chengzi slew the ruler of Qi and stole his state. What he stole was not merely the state—he seized along with it the sagely laws of wisdom. Thus, Tian Chengzi bore the name of a bandit while enjoying the security of Yao and Shun; small states dared not condemn him, and great states dared not punish him. For twelve generations, his line held Qi. Was this not the theft of the state *and* its sagely laws, using them to safeguard his bandit’s life?

This chapter reveals the boldness of indignant lament. Its metaphors are striking and singular. *Qu* (胠) means "to open," *tan* (探) "to reach in and take." *Fa* (发) also means "to open"—yet the phrase "mouse-thieving bandits" is omitted here, is this not a lapse in style?

*Jian teng* (缄縢) are knotted cords; *she* (摄) means "to bind." *Jiong* (扃) refers to a bolt, *jue* (鐍) to a lock. The world’s wisdom is meant to guard against petty thieves, but when a great thief comes, he carries it all away.

Tian’s usurpation of Qi—using private measures for lending and public measures for collecting—shows how he borrowed the sages’ laws to advance his bandit’s schemes. Such was the way of the Warring States era, and thus Zhuangzi uses this to illustrate his point.

Let us examine further: Is there any so-called supreme wisdom in the world that does not serve to accumulate for the great thief? Or any so-called supreme sagacity that does not stand guard for him? How do we know this is so?

In ancient times, Long Feng was beheaded, Bi Gan was disemboweled, Chang Hong was torn apart, and Wu Zixu was torn to shreds—though all four were worthy men, they could not escape execution. Meanwhile, Robber Zhi’s followers asked him: "Does even theft have its Way?" Zhi replied: "Where is there anything that lacks a Way? To divine the treasures hidden in a house—that is sagacity. To enter first—that is courage. To withdraw last—that is righteousness. To know what can and cannot be done—that is wisdom. To divide spoils equally—that is benevolence. Without these five, no one in the world has ever become a great thief."

From this, we see that the good cannot stand without the Way of the sages, nor can Robber Zhi act without it. Since the world has few good people and many who are not, the sages bring little benefit to the world and much harm. *Chi* (胣) means "to tear"; *mi* (靡), "to shred"—both describe those who incur guilt and lose their lives. Though the four worthies were virtuous, they all met ruin, while Robber Zhi evaded punishment. This shows that virtue is no sure defense, and those who usurp the name of the sagely Way may yet profit from it.

The thief’s "sagacity, courage, righteousness, wisdom, and benevolence"—these are terms Zhuangzi invents to mock the Confucians. Though his words seem strange, when viewed in light of worldly affairs, they hold truth. His observation that the unvirtuous outnumber the virtuous, and that the sages bring little benefit but much harm to the world, is profoundly incisive.

Thus it is said: When the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold. When the Lu wine was weak, Handan was besieged. When sages arise, great thieves appear.

Smash the sages, release the bandits—and only then will the world be ordered. When rivers run dry, valleys empty; when hills are leveled, abysses fill. If the sages die, great thieves will not arise, and the world will be at peace, free of trouble. But if the sages do not die, great thieves will never cease. To exalt the sages in governing the world is to heap profit upon Robber Zhi.

When Chu attacked Lu for its weak wine, Liang then besieged Zhao because Lu could not come to its aid. Lips and teeth seem unrelated, yet when the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold. Rivers and valleys seem unconnected, yet when rivers run dry, valleys empty. Hills and abysses seem unrelated, yet when hills are leveled, abysses fill. This is like the saying: "When Zhang drinks, Li gets drunk." It illustrates how the sages’ laws are not made for thieves, yet become their tools. Thus: When sages arise, great thieves appear; when sages do not arise, great thieves do not arise.

To "smash the sages and release the bandits" means that without sages and without thieves, the world will be ordered. When rivers are full, valleys too hold water; when rivers run dry, valleys empty. Though rivers and valleys do not connect, they share the same rise in spring and summer and the same ebb in autumn and winter. *Qiu yi* (丘夷) means "hills leveled"—like mountains worn down to the earth. When hills are leveled, their soil fills the abyss. Though unrelated, they are mutually dependent. *Wu gu* (无故) means "without incident."

To "exalt the sages in governing" means the sages return, and their laws grow ever more intricate. Those who deceive gain these laws and use them to deceive the world all the more. Thus it is said: "To heap profit upon Robber Zhi."

The tale of Lu’s weak wine and Handan’s siege also appears in the *Huainanzi*, though the wording differs, the meaning is the same.

When measures and pecks are made to gauge, thieves steal both the grain and the measures. When scales and balances are made to weigh, thieves steal both the goods and the scales. When tallies and seals are made to authenticate, thieves steal both the tokens and the seals. When benevolence and righteousness are made to rectify, thieves steal both the virtues and the names.

How do we know this is so? Those who steal a belt-hook are executed, while those who steal a state become lords; at the gates of lords, benevolence and righteousness reside—are these not stolen benevolence and stolen wisdom?

Measures, scales, tallies, and benevolence—these four are spoken of together to humble the exalted. Stealing a belt-hook is petty theft; the hook is the clasp of a sash. The lords of the Warring States seized power through usurpation—all were great thieves. The petty are punished, yet the great fare thus: words of indignation at the age. Once made lords, they establish their states by cherishing the people and benefiting things—this is not merely stealing the state but also stealing the sages’ benevolence and wisdom.

Thus, they are pursued as great thieves, yet exalted as lords. Those who steal benevolence and righteousness, along with the advantages of measures, scales, tallies, and seals—though offered chariots and emblems as reward, they cannot be encouraged; though threatened with axes and halberds, they cannot be restrained. That such profit emboldens Robber Zhi to the point of defiance is the fault of the sages.

Thus it is said: "Fish cannot leave the depths; the state’s sharpest tools must not be shown to others." Those sages are the state’s sharpest tools, not meant to enlighten the world.

Those called great thieves are shunned and driven away by all. Yet today’s lords are all state-stealers, standing above others—who does not see this? Thus it is said: "exalted." Such great thieves, so glaring in the world, steal along with benevolence, measures, scales, tallies, and seals, yet the age has never set rewards to capture them or punishments to forbid them—these are words of indignation at the age.

"Fish cannot leave the depths" means they cannot leave water. The sages’ laws are for their own use; they must not be made known to all. Thus it is said: "not meant to enlighten the world." To enlighten is to make known to all.

Therefore, reject the sages and discard wisdom, and great thieves will cease; smash jade and shatter pearls, and petty thieves will not arise; burn tallies and break seals, and the people will return to simplicity; shatter measures and snap balances, and the people will not contend. Only when the sages’ laws are utterly destroyed can the people be fit for discourse.

Smashing jade, shattering pearls, burning tallies, breaking seals, splitting measures, and snapping balances—these are all hyperbolic expressions to conclude the rejection of sages and wisdom; they are not literal arguments. "Utterly destroyed" means to abolish completely. Only when the sages’ laws are wholly removed can the people become pure and unified, fit to speak of the Way. Thus it is said: "the people may then be fit for discourse." These are all words of indignation at the age, so people often mock them with talk of splitting measures, snapping balances, burning tallies, and breaking seals. In truth, this aligns with Laozi’s meaning that "when rare goods are not valued, the people will not steal." The rhetoric is merely excessive.

Su Dongpo said: "When one learns to read, sorrow begins"—does this mean all under heaven should remain illiterate?

Disrupt the six pitch-pipes, melt and sever the zithers and lutes, stop up the ears of the blind musician Kuang, and all under heaven will preserve their natural hearing. Erase patterns, scatter the five colors, glue shut the eyes of Li Zhu, and all under heaven will preserve their natural sight. Destroy and discard hooks and cords, abandon compasses and squares, cripple the fingers of the craftsman Chui, and all under heaven will possess their innate skill. Thus it is said: "Great skill appears clumsy." Cut short the conduct of Zeng and Shi, silence the mouths of Yang and Mo, cast aside benevolence and righteousness, and the virtue of all under heaven will begin to merge in mystery.

When people preserve their sight, the world will not be dazzled; when they preserve their hearing, the world will not be burdened; when they preserve their wisdom, the world will not be deluded; when they preserve their virtue, the world will not be perverse.

Those like Zeng, Shi, Yang, Mo, Master Kuang, Craftsman Chui, and Li Zhu all set their virtue externally and thereby confuse and disorder the world—such are of no use to the true Dao. "Disrupt" means to pull and disorder. The six pitch-pipes have ordered lengths; if pulled and disordered, they become unusable. "Melt and sever" means to burn and discard. Only with the ears of Kuang can one attend to music; stop them up, and people’s hearing will all accord with nature, free from such contrivance. The meaning of "sight" and "skill" is the same. For "skill," Laozi’s saying "great skill appears clumsy" is cited as evidence—a matter of literary technique.

Zeng and Shi had names for loyalty and filial piety; Yang and Mo spoke of benevolence and righteousness. Cast them aside and discard them, so that such doctrines do not spread, and the people of the world will all attain this virtue, returning at last to the mysterious. "Not dazzled" means not scattered; "not burdened" means without entanglement; "not deluded" means not deceived; "not perverse" means without bias.

To speak of Zeng, Shi, Yang, and Mo alongside Master Kuang, Craftsman Chui, and Li Zhu is also to humble the exalted. "Setting virtue externally" means valuing external things and losing one’s original heart. "Confuse and disorder" means to befoul and disturb. From the perspective of the true Dao, such people are of no use—they should all be cast aside. Thus it is said: "of no use to the true Dao." This concluding phrase is powerfully rendered, a fine turn of phrase.

"Do you alone not know the age of utmost virtue?"

In ancient times there were the clans of Rongcheng, Dating, Bohuang, Zhongyang, Lilü, Lixu, Xuanyuan, Hexu, Zunlu, Zhurong, Fuxi, and Shennong—twelve clans in all. Of these, only Xuanyuan, Fuxi, and Shennong appear in the classics; the rest are not found in my books. Some may have been handed down from ancient traditions, or perhaps they were composed by Zhuangzi himself—who can say? It is like the Buddha speaking of past kalpas: though it may seem like grand speech, when viewed within the span of heaven and earth, from Fuxi onward, the records we can verify amount to little more than three thousand years. How vast could the world be? For three thousand years since Fuxi, there must have been ages unrecorded in the Six Classics. To speak of them would verge on the fantastical, yet they cannot be entirely dismissed. Consider my own land of Min: only from Wuzhu onward does it appear in Han records, and only from the Tang did it gradually acquire culture and refinement. Before Wuzhu, it must have been in a state of primitive simplicity. Recently, farmers plowing near Nangshan Temple suddenly uncovered a cave filled with vessels of gold and jade, tripods, and ritual bronzes—so many that people secretly carried them away. When the cave was finally emptied, the villagers gathered to examine the bricks, all of which, large and small, were carved with figures, dragons, and tigers, exquisitely crafted. This was an ancient tomb. Later, when they struck one of the walls with a hoe or axe, it rang with a resonant *tang-tang*, solid and immovable, surely reinforced with molten bronze or iron. It must have been the tomb of a ruler, for otherwise, why would the records of Min’s early history make no mention of it? There must have been such things, though they were not transmitted. Thus, the clans of Rongcheng and Dating cannot be said never to have existed.

In those days, the people used knotted cords for records. They found sweetness in their food, beauty in their clothing, joy in their customs, and contentment in their dwellings. Neighboring states were within sight of one another, the sounds of their chickens and dogs carried between them, yet the people grew old and died without ever traveling beyond their own lands. In such an age, perfect governance was already achieved.

But now, people crane their necks and stand on tiptoe, saying, “In such-and-such a place there is a worthy,” and they carry provisions to flock there, abandoning their parents at home and neglecting their lords’ affairs abroad. Their footprints crisscross the borders of feudal states, and their chariot tracks extend for a thousand miles—all because those above excessively prize knowledge. If those above truly value knowledge but lack the Way, the world will fall into great chaos. How do we know this is so? From the sweetness of their food downward, this is drawn from the mountain paths where no trails exist. When they say, “In such-and-such a place there is a worthy,” and carry provisions to rush there, this is a veiled reference to Mencius and Xunzi—and by extension, Confucius himself. Observe the scholars of the Jixia Academy and the followers of Su Qin and Zhang Yi, and you will see that Zhuangzi’s critique arises from the customs of his time. To prize knowledge is to depart from the natural Way; hence it is said, “to prize knowledge but lack the Way.”

When the knowledge of bows, crossbows, fowling nets, and cunning traps abounds, the birds are thrown into chaos above. When the knowledge of hooks, bait, nets, weirs, and bamboo traps proliferates, the fish are thrown into chaos in the waters. When the knowledge of snares, fences, pitfall traps, and hunting nets spreads, the beasts are thrown into chaos in the marshes. When the sophistries of deceit, insidious poison, obstinate perversity, glibness, the “hard and white” paradox, and the “washing away of grime” in debates over sameness and difference multiply, the common people are bewildered by rhetoric. Thus, the world repeatedly falls into great chaos, and the fault lies in the prizing of knowledge.

*Bi* refers to a handled net; *yi* to shooting with a corded arrow; *jibian* to cunning and deception. *Xuege* is like the *chuxu* mentioned in the *Han shu*—wooden palisades, like the fences used today to trap deer and rabbits. *Jufu* is also a kind of net. *Zhizha* means using intelligence to deceive one another; *jiandu* means gradually corrupting and poisoning one another. *Xie* refers to obstinate perversity; *gu* to confusion and disorder. *Jiegou* means “horns locked in opposition,” and the “hard and white,” “washing away of grime,” and debates over sameness and difference were all names of contemporary sophists. To speak of the methods for catching fish, birds, and beasts alongside the arguments of sophists is akin to Zhuangzi’s earlier mockery of Zengzi, Shizi, and the like alongside measuring tools like the *dou* and *heng*—all are targets of his critique. *Meimei* means “repeatedly,” for it is always thus that great chaos arises, and the fault lies in the prizing of knowledge.

Thus, the world knows only to seek what it does not know and does not know to seek what it already knows. It knows only to condemn what it deems unworthy and does not know to condemn what it deems worthy. This is why there is great chaos. “Does not know” refers to the pursuit of external differences; “already knows” refers to what is clear and easily seen—the principles of nature. “Unworthy” lies in others; “worthy” lies in oneself. This is like the *Qiwu lun*’s “affirming what one affirms and denying what one denies.” To know only the faults of others while remaining blind to one’s own affirmations is also a form of error.

Thus, those above obstruct the brightness of the sun and moon, below they scorch the essence of mountains and rivers, and in between they disrupt the operations of the four seasons. Even the creatures that breathe faintly and the tiny, fluttering things lose their nature. How severe is the chaos wrought by the prizing of knowledge! From the Three Dynasties onward, this has been the case: abandoning the simple, unadorned people to delight in the toiling flatterers, forsaking the tranquil and effortless to take pleasure in the clamor of empty words. Such clamor has already thrown the world into chaos.

Above, the sun and moon; below, the mountains and rivers; in between, the cold and heat of the four seasons—even the faintest-breathing creatures and the tiniest, lightest-winged things lose their natural principles. How severe is the chaos wrought by the prizing of knowledge! This sigh concludes the passage.

*Chuanyuan* refers to creatures that move with faint breaths, clinging to the earth—like snails and earthworms. *Xiao* means small; *qiao* means light, referring to flying things like bees and butterflies. *Xiao* is pronounced *xiao*. *Zhongzhong* describes the appearance of sturdy, solid things; *yiyu* describes the appearance of busily striving outward.

"Heng-heng" refers to whispering and murmuring. Having concluded the previous passage, the text now substantiates it with the Three Dynasties, stating that from the Three Dynasties onward, this has been the case—hence the phrase, "From the Three Dynasties onward, it has been thus." The two phrases "heng-heng" and "yi-yi" are presented in parallel, but the following line singles out "heng-heng" to conclude, mirroring the earlier passage where "plain simplicity" allowed the people’s nature to flourish.

In the *Free and Easy Wandering*, the phrase "Tang’s questioning of Ji" serves as the opening, while here, "From the Three Dynasties onward, it has been thus" serves as the closing. Though their openings and closings differ, they share the same underlying mechanism.

**Outer Chapters: "In Yu"**
We have heard of letting the world rest in *yu*, but not of governing the world. The purpose of *in* is to prevent the world from corrupting its nature; the purpose of *yu* is to prevent the world from being swayed in its virtue. If the world neither corrupts its nature nor is swayed in its virtue, is there any need to govern it?

In the past, when Yao governed the world, he made the people joyful, each delighting in their nature—yet this was not tranquility. When Jie governed the world, he made the people weary, each constrained in their nature—yet this was not contentment. That which is neither tranquil nor content is not virtue. And that which is not virtue cannot endure for long—there is nothing in the world that proves otherwise.

We have heard of letting the world rest in *yu*, but not of governing the world. This passage again presents a topic in a single phrase, adopting yet another form. *In* conveys the meaning of ease and freedom. *Corruption* means disorder; when one is settled and still, there is no corruption. *Yu* conveys the meaning of tolerance and self-contentment; *sway* means being moved by external things. If the nature of the world’s people is not disordered and their virtue is not swayed by external things, what need is there to govern them?

*Not tranquil* means not at peace; *not content* means not joyful. The text contrasts Yao with Jie, much like the contrast between Zeng and Shi on the one hand, and Robber Zhi on the other. The entire book follows this pattern of argument, its principles never quite orthodox, yet its literary force is not easily matched. Comparing "not tranquil" with "not content" eliminates any sense of hierarchy.

If one is excessively joyful, one leans toward yang; if excessively angry, one leans toward yin. When yin and yang are both excessive, the four seasons fail to arrive, the harmony of cold and heat is disrupted, and does this not harm the human form? It causes people’s joy and anger to lose their proper place, their dwellings to lack constancy, their thoughts to lack self-possession, and their middle way to lack coherence. Thus, the world begins to exhibit arrogance, contention, isolation, and ferocity, and thereafter arise the conduct of Robber Zhi and the likes of Zeng and Shi.

Therefore, even if one were to reward all goodness in the world, it would not suffice; even if one were to punish all evil in the world, it would not be enough. Thus, the vastness of the world is insufficient for reward and punishment. From the Three Dynasties onward, people have been clamorous, ever preoccupied with reward and punishment—when would they have leisure to rest in the natural state of their nature and destiny?

Joy pertains to yang; anger pertains to yin. *Excess* means augmentation, the "excessive illness" spoken of in medical texts. When the center and harmony are achieved, heaven and earth assume their proper places; when the center and harmony are lost, the four seasons fail to arrive, cold and heat lose their harmony, the sequence of qi is disrupted, and people fall ill. *Causes people* refers to how Yao and Jie, being above, led people to such a state.

*Joy and anger lose their proper place* and *dwellings lack constancy* refer to reckless action and movement. *Thoughts lack self-possession* describes restless comings and goings, following the crowd in one’s thoughts. *Coherence* means order; lacking coherence means losing the middle way. *Arrogance* means excessive ambition. *Contention* means mutual reproach in debate. *Isolation* means standing alone. *Ferocity* means harshness and severity. These four words all describe disharmony. Robber Zhi and the likes of Zeng and Shi merely replace the terms "worthy" and "unworthy"—when the mind is not harmonious, neither worthiness nor unworthiness is genuine.

Those who govern the world reward the worthy and punish the unworthy. But if worthiness is not true worthiness, arising from hypocrisy, and the whole world is thus, then even if one wished to reward, it would not suffice. *Not enough* also means insufficiency, for such people abound in the world. The intent here is to criticize the worthy, contrasting them with evildoers to further suppress the former.

When people all yearn for reward and avoid punishment, engaging in pretense with one another, how can they rest in the natural principles of their nature and destiny? Moreover, if one delights in brightness, this is corruption through color; if one delights in sharpness of hearing, this is corruption through sound. If one delights in benevolence, this is disorder in virtue; if one delights in righteousness, this is perversion of principle. If one delights in ritual, this is assistance in skill; if one delights in music, this is assistance in excess. If one delights in sageliness, this is assistance in craft; if one delights in knowledge, this is assistance in blemish.

If the world is to rest in the natural state of its nature and destiny, the existence or absence of these eight matters is acceptable. If the world cannot rest in the natural state of its nature and destiny, these eight matters will then coil and tangle like weeds, throwing the world into chaos—and the world will then begin to revere and cherish them excessively. The world’s confusion is not merely a matter of error to be discarded. Rather, people purify themselves to speak of them, kneel to present them, drum and sing to dance for them—what am I to make of this?

Seeking brightness and delighting in the five colors, seeking sharpness of hearing and delighting in the five sounds—both corrupt one’s authenticity, hence they are called *corruption*. Virtue and principle are natural; benevolence and righteousness are contrived with intention, hence they are said to *disorder virtue* and *pervert principle*. *Skill* means ability; *excess* means indulgence. They treat ritual and music as external things, hence they are said to *assist in skill* and *assist in excess*. *Assist* means to aid and augment, making things worse. *Craft* means occupation; *blemish* means illness. Occupation is self-labor, illness is self-suffering—delighting in the names of sageliness and knowledge only increases labor and suffering, hence they are said to *assist in craft* and *assist in blemish*.

This term "sage" (*sheng*) merely approximates the word "skill" (*neng*), much like the modern expression "grass sage" (*caosheng*). Thus, even in the case of a thief, to recklessly conjecture the treasures hidden in a house is also called *sage*. These instances show how the meaning of a word may differ; readers must carefully distinguish them and not confuse them with the meanings found in the *Analects* and *Mencius*.

The eight are: clarity, keen hearing, benevolence, righteousness, ritual, music, sageliness, and knowledge. If one rests content in their natural state, then even if these eight exist, they cannot become a burden—thus it is said, "their presence is acceptable, their absence is acceptable." If one does not rest content in their natural state, then these eight can become harmful. *Luànjuàn* describes a cramped, constricted appearance; *cāngnáng* describes a meddlesome, cluttered appearance. How could it be merely a matter of transgression to be cast aside? It means not merely dabbling in a single fault before immediately ceasing.

"To speak with fasting and purification" means to expound with solemnity and exaggeration. "To advance on bended knee" means to transmit with utmost reverence and ritual propriety. "To drum, sing, and dance it" means that words alone are insufficient, so one resorts to hand gestures and foot stomping. These all satirize the scholars of the time.

"What would I do if I were like this?"—it means, "What, after all, are you all doing?"

"I do not speak of myself, but point to others—just as the *Odes* says, *'Let me pour from that golden goblet,'* where a wife praises her husband, or the *Documents* says, *'I have drowned myself in wine,'* where Weizi laments King Zhou. This is a matter of literary technique.

Thus, when the noble person is compelled to govern the world, there is nothing better than non-action. Only through non-action can one settle into the natural state of life and destiny. Therefore, one who values their own person above governing the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their own person above governing the world may be charged with the world. If the noble person can refrain from loosening their five viscera, refrain from overtaxing their intelligence, dwell like an effigy yet manifest the splendor of a dragon, remain deep and silent yet resound like thunder, move with spirit and the heavens follow—then, at ease in non-action, the myriad things will rise and fall of themselves. What leisure would I have to govern the world?

This passage speaks directly of governance through non-action and naturalness. The phrase *'compelled to'* already conveys the idea of possessing the world without being entangled by it. Only when one values their own person as more precious than governing the world can the world be entrusted to them; only when one cherishes their own person as more beloved than governing the world can the world be charged to them. These two lines are extraordinary in both phrasing and principle. When reading *Zhuangzi*, one must ponder such passages carefully.

The *Records of Ritual* says, *'Loosen the bonds of sinew and bone,'* which means to unbind the five viscera. *Zhuó* means to draw out—overusing one’s intelligence. *'Dwelling like an effigy'* refers to sitting as still as a corpse, as the *Qu Li* puts it. *Dragon* signifies refinement: though one dwells in stillness and non-action, their dignified bearing naturally possesses elegance, hence *'dwell like an effigy yet manifest the splendor of a dragon.'* *Profound* means deep and tranquil; *silent*, not speaking. *Thunderous voice* describes the power to move others—though one does not speak, their virtue stirs people, as the Chan school says, *'Though silent, their voice resounds like thunder.'* Hence *'remain deep and silent yet resound like thunder.'* *Spirit* refers to vitality; *heaven*, to the heavenly principle. When one’s every movement and gesture accords with the heavenly principle, it is called *'move with spirit and the heavens follow.'*

These three lines—how could one dismiss *Zhuangzi* as a heterodox text? Its principles are profound, its phrasing extraordinary, surpassing all other masters. *'Rising and falling'* alludes to the wild horses and motes of dust, the breath that animates living things. *Rising* means movement; *falling*, the minute and multitudinous. Observe the empty chamber where sunlight streams in like an egg—within the beam, the tiniest specks of dust become visible. These two words are wondrously chosen: they suggest motion yet stillness, multiplicity yet invisibility. Thus, *'rising and falling.'* If I practice non-action above, the people of the world will rise with the sun and rest at dusk, content and joyful, like the myriad things in their natural flux. Why should I trouble myself to govern them?

Cui Qu asked Lao Dan, *'If one does not govern the world, how can the hearts of the people be settled?'* Lao Dan replied, *'Be careful not to agitate the human heart. The human heart presses downward yet strives upward; up and down, it is imprisoned and slain. Supple and yielding, it softens the rigid and strong; sharp-edged and carved, it is scorching as fire, freezing as ice. In the space of a single bow and rise, it traverses beyond the four seas. When at rest, it is deep and still; when in motion, it hangs suspended from heaven. Proud and unbridled, it cannot be tethered—is this not the human heart?'*

This passage, when read alongside Mencius’ *'entering and exiting without fixed times, no one knows its direction,'* reveals its extraordinary nature. *'Do not agitate'* means not to disturb or provoke. *'Presses downward'* describes how, in times of frustration, the heart grows despondent, while in times of success, it ceaselessly seeks advancement. *'Upward'* refers to the heart’s aspiration; *'downward,'* its descent. To be driven upward or downward is to be imprisoned and slain—this is the suffering of self-imposed bondage. *Supple and yielding* describes grace and beauty. Even the rigid and strong may be softened by it, as Xiang Yu wept before Lady Yu. *Sharp-edged* refers to angularity; *carved*, to polishing. The proverb says, *'Entering the academy, one’s corners are filed away, emerging like a chicken’s head'*—this is the idea. The young and successful often have many rough edges, but through hardship and worldly experience, these are worn smooth. Hence *'sharp-edged and carved.'* When inflamed, it burns like fire; when chilled, it congeals like ice—this describes the heart in moments of anger, sorrow, or fear. In the space of a single bow and rise, its thoughts range as far as beyond the four seas, so swift is its movement. *'Traverses'* means to pass through. *'At rest, it is deep and still'* describes the heart when unmoved; *'in motion, it hangs suspended from heaven'* describes how, once stirred, a single thought seems tethered to the sky. *Proud and unbridled* depicts defiance and obstinacy. *'Cannot be tethered'* means it cannot be controlled, as the Buddhist sutras say, *'How to subdue the heart?'* The word *'subdue'* already reveals the meaning of *'proud and unbridled, cannot be tethered.'* This passage’s depiction of the human heart is most extraordinary—without Zhuangzi’s brush, it could not easily be achieved.

Long ago, the Yellow Emperor first used benevolence and righteousness to agitate the human heart. Yao and Shun then wore away the flesh of their thighs and shins, exhausting their five viscera to cultivate benevolence and righteousness, straining their blood and qi to establish laws and standards—yet still they could not prevail. Yao banished Gun to Mount Chong, exiled the Sanmiao to Sanwei, and sent Gonggong to Youdu—this was his failure to master the world. By the time of the Three Kings, the world was thrown into great turmoil. Below were Jie and Robber Zhi; above, Zeng and Shi. Confucians and Mohists arose in full force. Joy and anger became mutual suspicions, the foolish and wise deceived one another, good and bad reviled each other, truth and falsehood mocked one another—and the world declined."

The great virtue diverged, and the principles of nature and destiny became scattered and disordered; the world prized knowledge, and the common people exhausted themselves in pursuit. "Flesh worn from the thighs" expresses the idea of cutting away living flesh; "shins devoid of hair" speaks of the toil of the feet. *Jin* (矜) sounds like *dong* (动), akin to *geng* (梗). The *mao* (矛) is the shaft—Xiang Ji’s *Biographies* speak of "moving the grain and thornwood shafts," here meaning the stiffening of one’s blood and qi, as if to say "choking one’s inner vitality." *Gui* (规) means "to enact," describing how they labored so for benevolence, righteousness, and legal standards—yet despite such toil, there remained matters beyond their control, hence the punishments of exile and banishment. "Unable to master the world" means they had no way to govern it. The four punishments brought the world into submission, originally a deed of Shun, yet Zhuangzi attributes it to Yao—this is why it is said that though his words may be uneven and strange, they are still worth observing (see the *Under Heaven* chapter). Here lies the inconsistency, where the truth is plainly revealed. If even Yao and Shun were thus, how much more shocking when it extended to the Three Kings! *Shi* (施) means "to extend." With rulers like this, below, petty men became like Jie and Robber Zhi, while above, gentlemen admired the reputations of Zeng and Shi, giving rise to the conflicts of Confucians and Mohists. From this arose self-satisfaction and anger toward others, self-proclaimed wisdom and contempt for others as foolish, self-righteousness and condemnation of others as wicked, self-trust and mockery of others as deceitful—each side mirroring the other, leading to mutual suspicion, deception, reproach, and ridicule, echoing the *Equalizing Things* chapter’s idea that "this too has its right and wrong, that too has its right and wrong." The phrase *lanman* (烂熳) is well-placed, for the principles of nature and destiny have become utterly disordered. *Qiujie* (求竭) means there is nothing left to respond with. Thus, axes and saws were wielded, inked cords and marking lines were used to kill, hammers and chisels were employed to decide—leaving the world in utter chaos. The fault lay in agitating the human heart. Therefore, the worthy retreated to dwell beneath the towering peaks of great mountains, while the lords of ten thousand chariots trembled with anxiety in their ancestral halls. In this age, those condemned to death lay piled upon one another, those in cangues and stocks jostled in crowds, and the executed were visible everywhere. Yet even then, the Confucians and Mohists began to lift their feet and wave their arms amidst the fetters, their arrogance so extreme, their shamelessness so profound. I do not know whether the wisdom of the sages does not become the cangue’s crossbeam and wedge, or whether benevolence and righteousness do not become the shackles’ chisel and tenon—how can we know that Zeng and Shi were not the harbingers of Jie and Robber Zhi? Thus it is said: "Cut off sageliness, cast aside wisdom, and the world will be greatly ordered."

The passage speaks of their inability to master the world, leading to the use of punishments. Axes, saws, inked cords, and chisels are all instruments of punishment. The *sheng* (绳) binds, the *mo* (墨) brands, and *jiji* (脊脊) means "piled up." The fault lies in agitating the human heart, beginning with the Yellow Emperor. The worthy hid and withdrew, while their rulers toiled in vain; those punished in the world were countless, the scene dire. Yet even in such times, the Confucians and Mohists still exalted themselves amidst the condemned, hence it is said they "began to lift their feet and wave their arms amidst the fetters." *Liqi* (离跂) means "limping and straining," while *rangbi* (攘臂) describes gesturing and speaking with raised arms—an air of self-importance. *Yi* (意) is an exclamation: "How extreme!" Their conduct was excessive, and the Confucians and Mohists were utterly shameless. The two instances of *shenyi* (甚矣) differ in meaning, both masterful strokes. *Hengyang* (桁杨) are restraints, and *xiangtui* (相推) describes the condemned pressing against one another. The cangue’s crossbeam and wedge arose from sagely wisdom, while the shackles’ chisel and tenon came from benevolence and righteousness. Jie and Robber Zhi used the teachings of Zeng and Shi to adorn their own harm, making Zeng and Shi the harbingers of thieves. *Jiexi* (椄槢) is the crossbar in the cangue, also a wedge. *Haoshi* (嚆矢) is today’s whistling arrow.

After the Yellow Emperor had reigned as Son of Heaven for nineteen years, with his decrees enforced throughout the world, he heard that Guangchengzi dwelled atop Kongtong Mountain and went to see him, saying: "I have heard that you, Master, have attained the perfection of the supreme Dao. I venture to ask: what is the essence of the supreme Dao? I wish to gather the essence of Heaven and Earth to aid the five grains and nourish the people. I also wish to govern yin and yang to bring all living things to fruition. How may this be done?" Guangchengzi replied: "What you wish to ask concerns the substance of things; what you wish to govern is the ruin of things. Since you began to govern the world, clouds do not gather before raining, grasses and trees do not wait to yellow before falling, and the light of the sun and moon grows ever more dim. As for your flattering heart, so narrow and constrained—how could it be worthy to speak of the supreme Dao? To gather the essence of Heaven and Earth to aid the five grains is to seek harmony and foster the growth of all things. To govern yin and yang to bring all living things to fruition is to harmonize and regulate yin and yang to accord with all things. *Guan* (官) means each fulfilling its office; when yin and yang do not conflict and each fulfills its role, it is called *guan*. The inherent nature of things is called *zhi* (质), the supreme Dao as mentioned earlier. The *can* (残) of things refers to what harms them. Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, are all principles of spontaneity; the five grains and all living things likewise grow and flourish of themselves. To act with intention in governing them is to become their ruin instead. *Er* (而) here refers to the Yellow Emperor. *Zu* (族) means "to gather." Clouds that do not gather before raining mean that here there is rain while there is none—untimely. Not waiting to yellow before falling is to lose the proper season.

Desolation refers to the moon’s light being partially eclipsed and thus diminished. *Huang* (荒) means "to abandon." *Jianjian* (翦翦) is akin to *qianqian* (浅浅), meaning shallow or slight. The Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquished the world, and built a solitary chamber with a thatched roof called *Maojian*. After dwelling there for three months, he again sought out Guangchengzi. Lying with his head to the south, the Yellow Emperor approached from the downwind side, crawling forward on his knees. He bowed twice, prostrating himself, and asked: "I have heard that you, Master, have attained the supreme Dao. I venture to ask how one may cultivate the body so as to achieve longevity."

Guangchengzi rose with a frown and said: "Excellent, this question of yours! Come, let me tell you of the supreme Dao. The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure; its ultimate state is dim and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness—then the body will naturally align. Be still, be pure; do not weary your form, do not disturb your essence, and you may attain long life. Let your eyes see nothing, your ears hear nothing, your heart know nothing—then your spirit will guard your form, and your form will endure. You did not ask about governing the world but about governing the self, and thus I deem this a fine question. Profound and obscure, it is distant and unfathomable. Dim and silent, it is subtle and invisible. Seeing nothing, hearing nothing—both eyes and ears are forgotten. The spirit abides in the heart, called *bao* (抱, to embrace); in stillness and non-action, the form corrects itself. The spirit must be pure and tranquil; the form must not be wearied; the qi must not be agitated—then one may attain long life. All arts of cultivation and refinement derive from this. Whether as immortals or Buddhas, such principles have existed since ancient times; this is not a teaching invented by Zhuangzi. *Wu lao wu yao* (无劳无摇, "do not weary, do not disturb")—here *wu* (无) is equivalent to *wu* (勿), conveying a prohibitive sense. 'Eyes see nothing, ears hear nothing, heart knows nothing' further elucidates the phrases 'see nothing, hear nothing' and 'embrace the spirit in stillness.' When the spirit guards the form, one may attain long life—this *shen* (神, spirit) is what modern practitioners of self-cultivation call the 'infant.' Guard your inner self, close off the outer; excessive knowledge leads to ruin.

I have guided you to the radiance of the great brightness—this is the origin of supreme yang. I have led you into the gate of profound obscurity—this is the origin of supreme yin. Heaven and Earth have their offices; yin and yang have their repositories. Guard your body with care, and all things will naturally flourish. I preserve the One and abide in harmony. Thus, I have cultivated myself for one thousand two hundred years, yet my form has never declined. Guard your inner self—do not disturb your heart. Close off the outer—do not let external things disturb your heart. Excessive knowledge becomes a burden; only when one knows nothing does virtue remain whole. Hence, it is said that excessive knowledge leads to ruin. The beginning of supreme yang is the great brightness; the beginning of supreme yin is profound obscurity. *Yuan* (原) means 'beginning.' The realm above the great brightness is the domain beyond the Great Void; the gate of profound obscurity is the inception of the Infinite. The *Yijing* speaks of 'the Dao as the alternation of yin and yang'—this is of the same import. Yet its expression is reserved, whereas Zhuangzi speaks with unbridled directness, hence his words are as they are. *Wei ru* (为汝, "for you") means "to teach you." *Sui* (遂) means "to follow" or "to proceed"; *ru* (入, "to enter") means "to delve deeply," indicating the desire to instruct you to the utmost. *Guan* (官) means "office"; *cang* (藏) means "repository." This speaks of the human body as containing Heaven and Earth, yin and yang. My Heaven and Earth each fulfill their offices; my yin and yang each reside in their proper places. Thus, this body may be carefully guarded, and all things will naturally become firm. *Wu* (物, "things") refers to all that constitutes the self; hence, it is said that things will naturally flourish. What is guarded is the One, undivided; what is abided in is harmony without discord. This is why, though my form has endured for one thousand two hundred years, it has not declined. *Chu* (处, "to abide") means to engage with affairs and things, responding to stimuli. Heaven and Earth here refer to the vigor and compliance within the self.

The Yellow Emperor bowed twice and prostrated himself, saying: "Guangchengzi is truly Heaven!" Guangchengzi said: "Come, let me tell you more. Those things are boundless, yet people all regard them as finite; those things are unfathomable, yet people all regard them as limited. Those who attain my Dao may ascend as sovereigns or descend as kings. Those who lose my Dao may see light above but become earth below. Now, the myriad beings all arise from the earth and return to the earth. Thus, I shall leave you and enter the gate of the boundless, to wander the wilds of the Infinite. I shall share radiance with the sun and moon, and endure with Heaven and Earth. Shall I be near? Shall I be distant? All others will perish, yet I alone shall endure."

When Guangchengzi is said to be "Heaven," it means he may unite with Heaven as one. How can things be boundless when people insist on seeking their end? How can things be unfathomable when people insist on seeking their limit? Thus, they pursue the finite while following the infinite. These two lines are deeply resonant. To speak crudely, it is like forging iron into a threshold—ghosts clap their hands and laugh, for this is the same idea. The *Yijing* does not conclude with *Jiji* (既济) but with *Weiji* (未济), for it recognizes that things are boundless and unfathomable. When Confucius stood by a river and said, "What passes is like this," he too referred to the boundless and unfathomable. Above, one may become a sovereign; below, one may become a king—these terms *huang* (皇) and *wang* (王) refer to the sage who fulfills all human relationships and the king who perfects all systems, as in the *Tianxia* chapter’s "inner sageliness and outer kingliness." *Huang* is non-action; *wang* is action—not the Three Sovereigns or the kings of the Three Dynasties. "Seeing light above" refers to the sun and moon; "becoming earth below" refers to the ground. It speaks of dwelling between Heaven and Earth in ignorance, seeing only the sun and moon when one looks up and only the earth when one looks down. *Baichang* (百昌) means "the hundred beings." They arise from the earth and return to the earth—like leaves falling to their roots, the putrid transforming into the wondrous, the wondrous transforming into the putrid. *Qu ru* (去汝, "leaving you") means departing from the human world."

The Gate of the Boundless, the Wilderness of the Limitless—this speaks of what lies beyond Heaven and Earth. One may endure as long as the sun, moon, Heaven, and Earth, thus "sharing their light with the sun and moon, standing constant with Heaven and Earth." *Min* (缗) is akin to *ming* (冥), meaning dim and obscure. "That which meets me" comes toward me; "that which distances itself from me" turns away from me. The coming and going of things—I remain oblivious, unmoved, and thus say: "What meets me is dim; what distances itself is obscure."

Cloud General was traveling east when he passed the branch of the Whirlwind Tree and chanced upon Vast Vagueness. Vast Vagueness was just then slapping his thighs and leaping about in play. Seeing him, Cloud General halted in astonishment, standing rigid, and asked: "Old sir, who are you? Why are you doing this?" Vast Vagueness, still slapping his thighs and leaping, replied: "Wandering." Cloud General said: "I wish to ask you something." Vast Vagueness looked up at him and sighed: "Ah!" Cloud General said: "Heaven’s qi is disharmonious; Earth’s qi is pent up. The six qi are out of balance; the four seasons are disordered. Now I wish to blend the essence of the six qi to nurture the myriad beings—how should I proceed?" Vast Vagueness slapped his sides, leapt, and shook his head: "I do not know! I do not know!" Cloud General could not press his question.

Three years later, Cloud General traveled east again, passing through the wilds of Song, where he once more encountered Vast Vagueness. Overjoyed, he hastened forward and said: "Has Heaven forgotten me? Has Heaven forgotten me?" He bowed twice, prostrating himself, and begged to ask Vast Vagueness a question. Vast Vagueness said: "Aimless wandering, knowing not what you seek; reckless roaming, knowing not where you go. The wanderer is restless, observing only the unfeigned. What do I know?" Cloud General said: "I too thought myself reckless, yet the people follow wherever I go. I cannot escape them—now they imitate me. I wish to hear a single word." Vast Vagueness said: "To disrupt Heaven’s warp, to defy the nature of things—this cannot fulfill the mysterious workings of Heaven. Scatter the herds of beasts, and birds will cry out at night; calamity will strike the grasses and trees, disaster will befall the insects. Alas! This is the fault of governing men."

The branch of the Whirlwind Tree is where the Fusang Tree rises with the sun. *Slapping his thighs and leaping* describes his joyful, carefree bounding. *Tangran* (傥然) conveys a look of self-forgetfulness; *zhanran* (贽然) suggests standing tall and motionless. *Old sir* refers to Vast Vagueness. When Zhaozhou met Touzi returning from buying oil, he remarked: "I have long heard of Touzi—today I see only an oil-buying old man." Touzi replied: "Oil, oil." Observe how this Chan matter unfolds. When Cloud General says *wandering*, Zhuangzi depicts him in a state of exultation. The character for *oil* differs from *wandering*—this is not to equate the two. *Unceasingly* replying while leaping, *looking up* and sighing—such subtleties are wondrous in themselves. The phrase *nurturing the myriad beings* echoes the earlier dialogue with the Yellow Emperor. *Shaking his head* means to refuse. *Has Heaven forgotten me?*—*Zhen* (朕) means "I." Calling Vast Vagueness "Heaven," he asks: "We met once before—do you still remember? Or have you forgotten me?" *Aimless wandering* means roaming without purpose; *reckless* means unrestrained. *Knowing not what you seek* means having no goal; *knowing not where you go* means having no destination. *Restless* describes a state of turmoil. *The unfeigned* is the real. To wander amid the world’s turmoil while observing one’s own reality. *I cannot escape them* means he wishes to withdraw but cannot. *Imitate* means to follow as a model—the people take me as their standard.

*Heaven’s warp* refers to the natural order of things, which is simply spontaneity itself. Now, acting with intention disrupts and defies this spontaneity—how can one fulfill the transformations of the mysterious Heaven? Thus it is said: "This cannot fulfill the mysterious workings of Heaven." *Mysterious* means empty, akin to "prior to Heaven." When herds do not contend, there is no distinction between same and different. Now, scattering them creates division—self and other, same and different. Birds cry at night in alarm. Failing to assist things in following their nature causes grasses, trees, and insects to suffer disaster. All this begins with the intention to govern men—just as before, the fault lies in disturbing the human heart.

Cloud General asked: "Then what should I do?" Vast Vagueness said: "Alas! How poisonous! Return, return, in light steps." Cloud General said: "I have met with Heaven’s difficulty—grant me a single word." Vast Vagueness said: "Ah! Cultivate the heart. You need only abide in non-action, and things will transform of themselves. Cast off your form, expel your cleverness, forget both self and things, and merge with the vast primordial. Release the heart, free the spirit, and become as though soulless. The ten thousand things, teeming and swarming, each return to their root—each return to their root without knowing it. Remain in undifferentiated chaos, never departing from it your whole life. If you claim to know it, you have already departed from it. Do not inquire into names; do not pry into natures—things arise of themselves."

Cloud General said: "Heaven has bestowed virtue upon me and shown me silence. Seeking it in myself, I have now attained it." He bowed twice, prostrated himself, rose, and took his leave.

"What should I do now?" means: "Given this, how should I proceed?"

Alas! This is like the "Alas! Alas!" spoken of by the stone. Soaring, soaring—such is the urgency of departure. It means: you have already poisoned and tormented yourself; hasten back, there is no need to question me further. This passage of fabricated dialogue resembles the exchanges in the *Transmission of the Lamp*.

"Nurturing the heart" means: simply let this heart nurture itself—this is sufficient. It does not say "nurture the heart" but "heart-nurturing"; one must discern this carefully. "Merely" means "only": you need only abide in non-action, and things will transform of themselves. "Self-transforming" means ceaseless coming and going, self-arising and self-transforming. Cast off all your former cleverness and leave none of it behind. "倫" is interchangeable with "沦," meaning to sink and disappear. When you dissolve and forget both self and things, you merge with the vast primordial. "涬溟" refers to the formless, traceless beginning before qi arose.

"Release the heart" means to dissolve the heart that clings to having a heart; "free the spirit" means to release the spirit that clings to knowing. "莫然" means settled, at rest; "soulless" means without knowing. Essence is called *po*, spirit is called *hun*; "soulless" echoes the earlier phrase "lump-like, standing by virtue of form alone." The "heart" in "release the heart" differs from the "heart" in "heart-nurturing," just as the "spirit" in "free the spirit" differs from the "spirit" in "embracing the spirit in stillness." These terms demand careful reflection.

"Cloud-cloud" means teeming and swarming. All that is born must perish, yet though it perishes, it does not truly perish—for what perishes gives rise to new birth. Thus it is said: "each returns to their root without knowing it." "Undifferentiated chaos" describes the state of being without knowledge or awareness. Remain in this chaos, and you will never depart from the Dao your whole life. But if you claim to know it, you have already separated from it. This line is profoundly subtle; fix your gaze upon it.

"Names" refer to all distinctions; "natures" refer to likes and dislikes. "窥" means "to see." Without inquiring into names or prying into natures, you will be free of distinctions, free of preferences—this is non-action and spontaneity. When I embody non-action and spontaneity, the ten thousand things each follow their own nature, for this is their inherent way. Thus it is said: "things arise of themselves." "固" means "inherent."

"降" means "bestowed upon me"; "默" means "silence." Heaven has bestowed upon me the virtue of spontaneity and shown me the principle of wordlessness. Seeking it within myself, I have now attained it. "躬" means "personally" or "oneself": it is by seeking within my own being that I have obtained what I sought. Thereupon, I bowed in gratitude and departed.

The common run of people delight in those who agree with them and despise those who differ. Those who desire agreement and reject difference do so out of a desire to stand above the crowd. Yet those who seek to stand above the crowd—have they ever truly done so? Relying on the crowd to affirm what they have heard, they are no different from the crowd in skill. And yet they aspire to govern others' states—this is grasping at the benefits of the Three Kings while blind to the perils. To govern another's state with such an attitude is to gamble on luck. How many times can one gamble on luck without losing the state? The chance of preserving another's state is less than one in ten thousand, while the risk of losing it is more than ten thousand to one. How tragic that those who hold land do not understand this!

From this point to the end of the chapter, Zhuangzi expounds at length. To desire others to be like oneself and to resent their differences is to seek to place oneself above the crowd. Yet if one insists that others conform to what one has heard before feeling at ease, how is one any different from the crowd? Even if one wishes to stand out, how can one do so? If one claims unique insight, it must be that no one else understands—yet if one desires everyone to agree, then one's skills are no greater than the crowd's. Laozi said: "When few know me, then I am esteemed." Zhuangzi here turns the idea over again. This is akin to Han Tuizhi's remark about writing: "There is still the influence of others' words in it"—the meaning is the same.

Those who harbor such thoughts and yet seek to govern others' states are grasping for the advantages of the Three Kings while ignoring the inevitable harm. To scheme for another's state with such a mindset is to rely on luck. When luck is one's guiding principle, one sees only ruin—how can there be success? Yet those who hold land remain unaware, seduced by such people.

"有土者" refers to those who possess states, meaning the feudal lords of the time. This passage clearly satirizes the itinerant persuaders and strategists of the day.

Now, those who possess land possess great things. But great things cannot be treated as mere things. Only by not being treated as a thing can one govern things. To recognize that the governor of things is not a thing—how could this apply only to ruling the world and its people? Moving in and out of the six directions, roaming the nine provinces, coming and going alone—this is called "possessing alone." Those who possess alone are called "most noble."

Those who "govern things" have intentions and traces; those who "do not treat as things" act through non-action, spontaneously and naturally. Through non-action, nothing is left undone—thus it is said: "Not treating as a thing, one can govern things." If one recognizes that the governor of things is itself a thing, how could this apply merely to ruling the world? Thus it is said: "Moving in and out of the six directions, roaming the nine provinces." This speaks of the Dao transcending all things. Operating freely within creation, opening and closing with the transformations of nature, one becomes one with Heaven—no person can divide this unity. Hence it is said: "Coming and going alone."

"Heart-nurturing" means: simply let this heart nurture itself—this is sufficient. It does not say "nurture the heart" but "heart-nurturing"; one must discern this carefully. "Merely" means "only": you need only abide in non-action, and things will transform of themselves. "Self-transforming" means ceaseless coming and going, self-arising and self-transforming. Cast off all your former cleverness and leave none of it behind.

"Lun" is identical with "lun," meaning to sink and vanish. When one vanishes utterly and forgets all things, one becomes one with the primordial vastness. This "primordial vastness" is the formless, traceless beginning before qi arose.

"Dissolving the heart" means dissolving the heart that clings to having a heart; "releasing the spirit" means releasing the spirit that clings to knowing. "Mo Ran" means stillness—"without hun" means without knowing. The *po* is the essence, the *hun* is the spirit; "without hun" echoes the earlier phrase "a mere clod, standing by virtue of its form." The heart dissolved in "dissolving the heart" differs from the heart in "heart-nurturing," just as the spirit released in "releasing the spirit" differs from the spirit in "embracing the spirit in stillness." These terms demand careful discernment.

"Cloud-cloud" signifies multiplicity. "Each returns to its root": what is born must perish, yet though it perishes, it does not perish—what perishes gives rise to new birth. Thus it is said: "Each returns to its root, yet knows it not." "Hunhun dundun" describes the state of knowing nothing, sensing nothing. In this state, one never departs from the Dao; the moment knowing and sensing arise, one divides from the Dao. Thus it is said: "If one knew it, this would be to depart from it." This line is profoundly subtle—one must fix one’s gaze upon it.

All discrimination is called "name"; all likes and dislikes are called "emotion." "Peering" means seeing. Without questioning, without peering, there is no discrimination, no likes or dislikes—this is non-action and spontaneity. If I can be non-active and spontaneous, then all things fulfill their own lives, for this is their inherent nature. Thus it is said: "Things inherently live of themselves." "Inherent" means "innate."

"Jiang" means "bestowed upon me"; "mo" means "silent." The Way bestows upon me the virtue of spontaneity, reveals to me the principle of wordlessness. Turning inward to seek it, I have already attained this Dao. "Gong" means "personally," "oneself"—only by seeking within myself do I obtain what is to be obtained. Then, bowing in gratitude, he departed.

Ordinary people all delight in those who agree with them and resent those who differ. Those who desire agreement and reject difference do so with the aim of standing out from the crowd. Yet how can one who aims to stand out ever truly stand out? Relying on the crowd to secure what one has heard is no better than the crowd’s many skills. Yet those who would rule others’ states grasp at the advantages of the Three Kings while blind to the dangers. This is gambling with others’ states—how often can one gamble and not lose another’s state? The chance of preserving another’s state is less than one in ten thousand, while the risk of losing it is more than ten thousand to one. How tragic that those who possess lands do not understand this!

From this point to the end of the chapter, Zhuangzi unfolds his argument in full. To desire others to agree with oneself and resent their difference is to seek to place oneself above the crowd. Yet if one insists that all conform to what one has heard before feeling at ease, how is one different from the crowd? Though one may wish to stand out, how can one do so? If one claims unique insight, it must be that no one else understands—yet if one desires everyone to agree with oneself, then one’s skills are no greater than the crowd’s. Laozi said: "When few know me, then I am valued." Zhuangzi here turns the point another way. Han Tuizhi’s remark on writing—that it still contains others’ ideas—expresses the same meaning.

With such a mindset, to rule another’s state is to seize the Three Kings’ advantages while ignoring the inevitable harm. To scheme for another’s state is to rely on luck. When luck is one’s aim, one sees only ruin—how can there be success? Yet those who possess lands do not recognize such people and are deceived by them. "Those who possess lands" refers to the feudal lords of the time. This passage clearly satirizes the itinerant persuaders of the age.

Those who possess lands possess great things. Yet great things cannot be treated as things. Only by not being a thing can one master all things. To recognize that the master of things is not a thing—how could this apply merely to ruling the world and its people? Thus it is said: "Moving in and out of the six directions, roaming the nine provinces." This speaks of the Dao transcending all things. Operating freely within creation, opening and closing with the transformations of nature, one becomes one with Heaven—no person can divide this unity. Thus it is said: "Coming and going alone—this is called 'possessing alone.'" One who possesses alone is called "most noble."

Those who master things have intentions and traces. Those who are not things act without acting, spontaneously and naturally. Without acting, there is nothing they do not do. Thus it is said: "Not being a thing, they can master all things." If one knows the master of all things, how could this apply merely to ruling the world? Thus it is said: "Moving in and out of the six directions, roaming the nine provinces." This speaks of the Dao transcending all things. Operating freely within creation, opening and closing with the transformations of nature, one becomes one with Heaven—no person can divide this unity. Thus it is said: "Coming and going alone—this is called 'possessing alone.'" Such is the most noble.

The teaching of the great person is like a shadow following form, an echo answering sound. When questioned, they respond, exhausting what is in their heart to match the world. They dwell in no-sound, move in no-direction. Leading you, they guide you to the bustling throng, roaming without end. Entering and exiting without side, with the sun having no beginning, they praise and discuss the form and body uniting with the great unity. In great unity, there is no self—how could there be anything possessed by the self?

Those who see being are the gentlemen of old; those who see non-being are the friends of Heaven and Earth. The "great person" is the perfected person—the one who "possesses alone." Form must have shadow, sound must have echo—this is spontaneous and natural. When questioned, they exhaust what is in their heart to respond, matching the world with their single body. They are the host; the world is the guest. Without sound, without mark, without direction, without trace. "Naonao" describes the ceaseless movement of the multitude. "Shi" means "to go"; "qie" means "to lead."

You point to all the people of the world. "Return" means to go back; you lead all the people of the world to return into the midst of the ceaseless movement, for though one emerges from the world, one does not stand apart from it—emerging from the world and dwelling in the world are not two separate ways. "Without end" means without beginning; "without side" means boundless in all four directions. Entering and exiting, you wander within it, day after day in this manner, seeing no end—how could you know its beginning? Thus it is said: "with the sun having no beginning."

When we discuss and praise in terms of bodily form, all within Heaven and Earth share this same body, and so it is said: "they unite with the great unity." "Praise" means to extol. Since my body is the same as the myriad things, I cannot act for myself alone—this is "no self." If there is no self, then what could be possessed? This is what Master Pang meant by "emptying all that exists, not filling what does not."

The gentlemen of old saw only being; those who are friends with Heaven and Earth see non-being. When it says "the gentlemen of old," it includes all from Yao and Shun downward. That which is base yet cannot be neglected is *things*. That which is lowly yet cannot be forsaken is *the people*. That which is hidden yet cannot be left undone is *affairs*. That which is coarse yet cannot be abandoned is *laws*. That which is distant yet cannot be departed from is *righteousness*. That which is intimate yet cannot be left unexpanded is *benevolence*. That which is regulated yet cannot be left unaccumulated is *ritual*. That which is centered yet cannot be left unexalted is *virtue*. That which is unified yet cannot be left unchanged is the *Dao*. That which is numinous yet cannot be left undone is *Heaven*.

Observing this passage, one sees that Master Zhuang still concerns himself with worldly affairs—he does not merely discourse on emptiness and nothingness. Master Yichuan said that the Buddhists have "upward attainment" but no "downward study," and this is an excellent remark. Yet even in these few lines, there are places that approach "downward study," and an understanding that the refined and the coarse cannot be separated.

If the Dao is esteemed, then things are deemed base—but how can one abandon things? Thus it is said: "that which is base yet cannot be neglected is *things*." "Neglect" means to disregard. If the Dao is honored, then what pertains to people is lowly—yet how can one stand apart from people? Thus it is said: "that which is lowly yet cannot be forsaken is *the people*." "Forsake" means to depend upon. "Hidden" means concealed; "obscure" means dim. That which is clear is the Dao. When affairs are contrasted with the Dao, affairs are obscure—yet how can one entirely abandon worldly affairs? Thus it is said: "that which is hidden yet cannot be left undone is *affairs*."

The Dao is refined; laws are coarse. How can laws be entirely discarded? Thus it is said: "that which is coarse yet cannot be abandoned is *laws*." Righteousness is distant from the Dao—yet how can righteousness be abandoned? Thus it is said: "that which is distant yet cannot be departed from is *righteousness*." The Dao has no intimacy or estrangement; benevolence involves love. Though it is not the ultimate Dao, how can one abandon benevolence? One must extend it. Thus it is said: "that which is intimate yet cannot be left unexpanded is *benevolence*."

Ritual has regulations and forms, seeming forced upon the world, yet it cannot be left undone. Thus it is said: "that which is regulated yet cannot be left unaccumulated is *ritual*." The rituals number three hundred, the rules of deportment three thousand—how could these be accomplished by the effort of one person in a single day? Thus it is said: "accumulating virtue is what all people share." Though one harmonizes with the world, there are places where one must stand alone—how could one be the same as others? Thus it is said: "that which is centered yet cannot be left unexalted is *virtue*." "Centered" means harmonizing with others.

That which is unified with the natural is the Dao. Yet there are places where change is necessary—how could one cling to oneness without change? Thus it is said: "that which is unified yet cannot be left unchanged is the *Dao*." That which is unknowable is called numinous; what Heaven does is all unknowable. Human affairs cannot be left undone—how could one entirely entrust them to the unknowable? Thus it is said: "that which is numinous yet cannot be left undone is *Heaven*."

Thus the sage observes Heaven yet does not assist, completes virtue yet is not burdened, emerges from the Dao yet does not scheme, unites with benevolence yet does not rely on it, approaches righteousness yet does not accumulate it, responds to ritual yet does not conceal, engages with affairs yet does not yield, equalizes through laws yet is not disordered, depends on the people yet does not belittle them, and follows things yet does not abandon them.

Things are not worth doing, yet they cannot be left undone. Those who do not understand Heaven are not pure in virtue; those who do not comprehend the Dao have no means to proceed. Those who do not understand the Dao—how lamentable! "Not assisting" means not applying force. What pertains to people cannot be left undone, yet when viewed with the eye of the Dao, though one acts, one does not apply force. Thus it is said: "observes Heaven yet does not assist." This "assist" is the same as in "assisting growth."

"Not burdened" means not piling up to become lofty. Piling up to become lofty is to harbor intentions that are not natural. "Burdened" is pronounced like *lěi*. "Not scheming" means having no mind for calculation. "Not relying" means not considering it a personal favor. "Unites" means to gather. "Accumulating" means not transforming; if one does not accumulate, one transforms. "Approaches" means to press near. Though one’s conduct is near to righteousness, one does not consider oneself to possess it—if one accumulates righteousness, one does not transform.

"Not concealing" means not being constrained by taboos. "Responds" means to engage. If one is bound by the forms of ritual, there are things one conceals and avoids. What can be done is done; one engages with things as they come. Thus it is said: "responds to ritual yet does not conceal." "Yielding" means shrinking back. In engaging with affairs, one acts directly and straightforwardly, without shrinking back. Thus it is said: "engages with affairs yet does not yield."

Using laws to equalize things, even amid complexity there is a sense of simplicity and directness. Thus it is said: "is not disordered." Though the people can be depended upon, one does not belittle them. Though things can be relied upon, one does not abandon the root to pursue the branches.

From the preceding lines to this point, the discussion has fully turned—yet once more the character "thing" (物) is raised: "Nothing is worth doing, yet nothing can be left undone." This "thing" encompasses both the refined (精), which is the Dao, and the coarse (粗), which is the material world; all affairs and all things reside within it. Viewed through the mind of Dao, nothing is worth doing. Yet there are things that cannot be left undone—this is where the human mind comes into play. From this single line, can we not see that Zhuangzi understood the principle of the refined and the coarse as one?

It is further said: "One who does not understand Heaven cannot perfect virtue." Though worldly affairs cannot be left undone, one must grasp the principle of spontaneity. Without understanding the spontaneity of Heaven’s principle, one’s own virtue remains impure. To be unpervaded by the Dao is to be unenlightened about Heaven. "There is nowhere one can go without obstruction"—this means that without progress, one encounters only blockages.

Earlier, it was said that one who does not understand Heaven is unpervaded by the Dao; here, at the conclusion, it is again stated that one does not understand the Dao. Thus, the two phrases—"not understanding Heaven" and "not pervaded by the Dao"—express the same idea.

What is the Dao? There is the Dao of Heaven and the Dao of humanity. The honored is that which is without action: this is the Dao of Heaven. The encumbered is that which acts: this is the Dao of humanity. The ruler follows the Dao of Heaven; the minister follows the Dao of humanity. The Dao of Heaven and the Dao of humanity are vastly different—this cannot be left unexamined. These two lines are most subtle and most intimately connected to learning, yet readers often overlook them without deep inquiry.

That which is without action yet honored is the spontaneity of Heaven’s Dao; that which acts and is encumbered is the inescapable doing of humanity’s Dao. The former pertains to the mind of Dao; the latter, to the human mind. This word "encumbered" (累) is akin to "perilous" (危). The ruler embodies the Dao of Heaven—this means taking the mind of Dao as the master. The minister embodies the Dao of humanity—this means making the human mind obey. These terms "ruler" and "minister" do not refer to courtly sovereigns and subjects; readers have long mistaken them as such. They refer to the sovereign and subject within the self. As the *Qi Wu Lun* says: "Do they alternate as ruler and subject? Is there a true ruler abiding within?" This is how they should be understood.

Zhuangzi’s writings generally esteem non-action and disdain action. Having already explained that there are things one cannot leave undone, he feared that readers might conflate action and non-action. Thus, he reiterates here: "The Dao of Heaven and the Dao of humanity are vastly different—this cannot be left unexamined." The text opens and closes, rises and falls, with mutual resonance throughout. If one sees this clearly, it becomes lively and dynamic. Yet his language is intricate, shifting and transforming like drumbeats—hence, some fail to fully grasp it.

Take, for instance, the phrases: "That which is distant yet cannot be left uninhabited" (referring to righteousness) and "That which is near yet cannot be left unexpanded" (referring to benevolence). Such expressions do not align with the coherent principles of the sages and worthies, and thus drift toward heterodoxy. One must not read them as one would the *Analects* or *Mencius*.

From "That which is lowly yet cannot be left unassigned" to "this cannot be left unexamined," this is one of the great guiding principles in Zhuangzi’s thought, akin to the *Tian Xia* chapter. Su Dongpo observed that Zhuangzi never criticized Confucius, a point discerned from the *Tian Xia* chapter. Here, we see that Zhuangzi never failed to understand the principle of the refined and the coarse, the fundamental and the incidental, as one.

There is another perspective: the words of sages and worthies endure for all ages without flaw, yet the various masters of the Hundred Schools also have their incisive insights. Consider the *Yi Jing*: "That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the vessel. To transform and regulate it is called change; to extend and enact it is called penetration. To lift and apply it to the people of the world is called the enterprise of the sage." And again: "What is perceived is called the image; what takes form is called the vessel. To fashion and employ it is called the law. When its utility is employed in egress and ingress, and the people all use it, it is called the numinous." Did it not speak of the refined? Did it not speak of the coarse? Expressed with such seamless integrity, it naturally avoids flaw.

Lèxuān remarked: "When Confucians awaken to the Dao, their minds become ever more refined; when Chan Buddhists awaken to the Dao, their minds become ever coarser." This penetrates to the marrow of the distinction between Confucianism and Buddhism—something unseen before. In passages like this, Zhuangzi belittles worldly affairs, dismissing them as base and coarse, yet interjects the phrase "cannot be left undone." Such maneuvers are even coarser, lacking the spirit of "only refinement, only unity" and the equilibrium of "holding fast to the center." Only by discerning this distinction in refinement and coarseness can one recognize that Lèxuān truly awakened to the Dao—he was a man of great vision. Others who refute Buddhism merely scratch the surface; since Buddhism claims to be a "dharma beyond the world" and attacks human relationships and ethical norms, how could they ever convince its adherents?

**Outer Chapters: "Heaven and Earth"**

Though heaven and earth are vast, their transformations are uniform.
Though the myriad things are numerous, their governance is one.
Though the masses of people are many, their lord is the ruler.
The ruler originates in virtue and is perfected by Heaven. Thus it is said: the rulers of remote antiquity governed all under heaven through non-action, embodying nothing but the virtue of Heaven.

That their transformations are uniform means all are of primordial *qi*. "Governance" means mastery. Though the myriad things are numerous, what masters them is but the singular work of creation. Though the masses of people are many, their lord is the ruler—just as heaven has no second sun, nor the people a second king.

What Heaven bestows upon me is virtue. If I can trace the origin of this virtue, seeing that all is perfected by Heaven, then human effort adds nothing. Should one who is a ruler comprehend this, he would govern through non-action, following nature—non-action and naturalness being the virtue of Heaven.

"Remote" (*xuán*) means distant; "remote antiquity" (*xuángǔ*) is akin to "deep antiquity." Viewing all under heaven through the Dao, the ruler is rectified. Viewing distinctions through the Dao, the principles of ruler and minister become clear. Viewing abilities through the Dao, the offices of all under heaven are well-ordered. Viewing all things broadly through the Dao, the responses of the myriad things are complete.

Thus, what pervades heaven and earth is virtue. What courses through the myriad things is the Dao. What governs the people above is affairs. What enables skillful execution is technique. Technique is encompassed by affairs, affairs by righteousness, righteousness by virtue, virtue by the Dao, and the Dao by Heaven.

Between heaven and earth, where there is *qi*, there is sound; where there is sound, there are names. When names designate the ruler, the divisions of all under heaven are settled. This was determined from the very beginning, when sound first arose—it is natural. Thus it is said: viewing all through the Dao, the ruler of all under heaven is established. "Speech" (*yán*) is sound; the Dao is nature.

Once these divisions exist, the principles of ruler and minister naturally follow, as high and low are arrayed, and noble and base assume their stations. Thus it is said: viewing distinctions through the Dao, the principles of ruler and minister become clear.

The affairs of all under heaven cannot be managed by one person alone; rather, each fulfills their duties according to their abilities. What enables these abilities is bestowed by Heaven. For Heaven brings forth many people to accomplish many tasks. Thus it is said: viewing abilities through the Dao, the offices of all under heaven are well-ordered.

Among the myriad things, nothing exists without its counterpart: where there is cold, there is heat; where there is female, there is male; where there is above, there is below; where there is front, there is back; where there is left, there is right. Each responds to the other, all arising naturally. Thus it is said: viewing all things broadly through the Dao, the responses of the myriad things are complete.

These four phrases are most exquisite, their language pure and unadulterated.

Heaven covers and engenders; earth bears and completes—both share this virtue. "Pervades" (*tōng*) means "unites." Among the myriad things, each follows its natural principle. Thus it is said: what courses through the myriad things is the Dao.

What those above use to govern—rites, music, punishments, and policies—are the affairs of governance. Within each affair lies its respective craft, and what enables these is human technique.

The Dao and virtue are refined; affairs and technique are coarse. Yet both refined and coarse arise from nature. Thus technique is affairs, affairs are righteousness, righteousness is virtue, virtue is the Dao, and the Dao is Heaven. "Encompassed" (*jiān*) means "uniting two as one." "Righteousness" (*yì*) was originally written as "art" (*yì*), a scribal error due to their similar pronunciation.

Thus it is said: those of antiquity who nurtured all under heaven desired nothing, and all under heaven was sufficient; they acted not, and the myriad things were transformed; they were profound and still, and the hundred clans were settled.

The Record states: "Grasp the One, and the myriad affairs are complete; attain effortless attainment, and even spirits submit." To "nurture all under heaven" is what Mencius called "nourishing all under heaven with goodness." If I desire nothing, all under heaven is naturally sufficient; if I act not, all under heaven is naturally transformed; if I am still, the hundred clans are naturally settled. "Profound stillness" (*yuānjìng*) is clarity and tranquility.

The myriad affairs are but one principle. Thus it is said: grasp the One, and the myriad affairs are complete. If what is attained within me is free of contrivance, not only will people submit, but even spirits will yield. "The Record states" means "as the tradition has it." These words were handed down from high antiquity, and Zhuangzi cites them as corroboration. These five phrases are exceedingly pure, with the first three resembling the thought of Laozi.

The Master said: "The Dao is that which covers and bears the myriad things. Vast and boundless, how great it is! The noble person cannot but hollow out his heart." Non-action in doing is called Heaven; non-action in speaking is called virtue; loving others and benefiting things is called benevolence; uniting what is different is called great conduct; being unbound by distinctions is called magnanimity; possessing myriad differences is called abundance.

Thus, holding fast to virtue is called discipline; the completion of virtue is called establishment; following the Dao is called fulfillment; not allowing things to thwart one’s resolve is called wholeness. Should the noble person comprehend these ten principles, his mind would be vast in its engagement with affairs, and he would flow with the myriad things in boundless abundance.

"The Master" refers to his teacher. "Hollowing out the heart" means excising the heart of discriminating awareness. Only by removing this heart of awareness can one study the Dao.

"Others" (*rén*) means nature. Acting in accordance with nature is called Heaven. What is attained within oneself is self-evident without speech. Thus it is said: non-action in speaking is called virtue. "Non-action in speech" means having nothing to say.

What is different is also the same. Thus it is said: uniting what is different is great. "Distinctions with traces" (*yáyì*) means having form; "magnanimity" (*kuān*) means expansiveness.

The myriad things are all different, yet I possess them all—thus it is said: to contain ten thousand differences is called abundance. This means all things are complete within me.

*Ji* (紀) means order. The virtue one holds, whether great or small, follows a sequence and has its own order—thus it is said: holding to virtue is called *ji*. Standing towering as if established marks the completion of virtue. Following the Dao in action, nothing is lacking—*bei* (備) means the Dao is whole and perfect, complete. When external things cannot disturb the mind, what lies within remains whole—thus it is said: not allowing things to thwart one’s resolve is called perfection.

These ten are: the heavenly virtue, benevolence, greatness, magnanimity, abundance, order, establishment, completeness, and perfection. *Tao* (韜) means concealment, encompassing all affairs without omission, all returning to the mind. This mind is so vast it has no bounds—thus it is said: vast in its engagement with affairs. *Shi* (逝) means to go, flowing like this passing away. The myriad things come and go without end, yet I move with them in boundless abundance—thus it is said: flowing with the myriad things in boundless abundance.

One who is thus conceals gold in the mountains and pearls in the depths, neither valuing wealth nor seeking nobility and riches. They do not rejoice in long life nor grieve over early death, feel no pride in success nor shame in poverty. They do not confine the world’s benefits for private gain, nor regard ruling all under Heaven as a mark of distinction—distinction lies in clarity. All things are stored in a single repository; death and life share the same form.

Concealing gold in the mountains and pearls in the depths means wealth is stored throughout the world. "Not seeking" means keeping distance. They do not take longevity or early death as causes for joy or sorrow, nor success or failure as grounds for honor or disgrace—*chǒu* (丑) here surpasses *rǔ* (辱) in meaning. The benefits of an age are shared with all, not hoarded as one’s private portion—this is the idea that when one loses a bow, another gains it. Though ruling all under Heaven, they do not consider themselves exalted; the imperial yellow canopy was not Yao’s desire. The clarity within their breast illuminates Heaven and Earth—this is true distinction, so they do not regard ruling all under Heaven as distinction.

Gathering the myriad things into one principle is called a single repository. Death and life are great indeed, yet they bring no change to the self—viewing them as one is called sharing the same form.

The Master said: The Dao dwells in profound stillness, its clarity like flowing water. Metal and stone cannot remain silent—thus they have sound, yet without striking, they do not ring. Who can determine the myriad things?

"Dwelling in profound stillness" means tranquility, stillness, and stability. "Clarity like flowing water" means purity without mixture or confusion. The resonance of metal and stone is also the natural work of Heaven—thus it is said: metal and stone cannot remain silent. This resonance is itself the Dao. Yet though metal and stone have sound, without human striking, they do not ring—human striking is also the work of Heaven’s mechanism. These two lines express the same principle as the earlier saying: how do we know what I call Heaven is not human, and what I call human is not Heaven? Thus it is said: who can determine the myriad things? Heaven relies on humanity to act, and humanity relies on Heaven to complete—this is the same idea, though the wording here is extraordinary.

One who embodies royal virtue moves with simplicity and feels shame in becoming entangled in affairs. They establish the root and understand the divine in its manifestations. Thus their virtue is vast, and their mind’s responses are shaped by things. Therefore, form does not arise without the Dao, and life is not illuminated without virtue. Preserving form and exhausting life, establishing virtue and illuminating the Dao—is this not the mark of one with royal virtue?

Vast and boundless, they suddenly emerge, stirring dynamically, and the myriad things follow them—this describes one with royal virtue. *Wangde* (王德) means possessing the virtue to rule all under Heaven. *Su shi* (素逝) means moving with unadorned simplicity, like the *Yi*’s "plainly treading the path." They act without doing, yet nothing is left undone, and they do not seek recognition—thus it is said: feeling shame in becoming entangled in affairs. The root is the origin of the myriad things. "Understanding the divine in its manifestations" means perfect sincerity like the divine. *Cai* (采) means to take. Things take from me, and only then does the mind respond—thus it is said: the mind’s responses are shaped by things. *Cai* means to be moved; *chu* (出) means to respond.

All things are born of creation; all that have form share this Dao. Yet without self-realization, the Dao remains unilluminated—meaning it is not understood. The next *sheng* (生) refers to my receiving the center of Heaven and Earth to live. Preserving my form to exhaust the principle of life’s origin, establishing my virtue to illuminate the natural Dao—this is beyond the capacity of ordinary people. *Dangdang* (荡荡) describes greatness. "Suddenly emerging" means rising above the multitude. "Stirring dynamically" expresses the inevitability of action. "The myriad things follow" means that when the sage acts, all things behold it.

Gazing into darkness, listening to silence: within obscurity, they alone perceive clarity; within silence, they alone hear harmony. Thus, delving ever deeper, they can engage with things; refining ever further, they can attain subtlety. Therefore, in their interaction with the myriad things, they provide for all needs from nothingness. Timely and swift, they grasp the essence of all, whether great or small, long or short, near or far.

*Mingming* (冥冥) is the realm of formlessness. Gazing into formlessness yet perceiving clarity is like the *huanghu* (恍惚) where images emerge. Others consider it silent, yet they alone hear, as in the harmony of the eight sounds—this is not seeing others but seeing oneself, not hearing others but hearing oneself. "Delving ever deeper" means entering the profound and wondrous. Yet they can also respond to things, adapting to the refined and the coarse. *Shen* (神) is formless; *jing* (精) is qi. With formlessness, they perceive the presence of qi—this is the interplay of the formless and the formed. What resides within me is emptiness, yet it responds to things.

To attain the ultimate nothingness is to fulfill the needs of all things. Timely and swift, they emerge and are put to use.

To grasp their ultimate destination is not to fix upon one, for they may be small or great, long or short, near or far—this is the meaning of timeliness. "Far-reaching" should be paired with "near" to complete the sense; here, "far-reaching" implies "long," yet its meaning clearly aligns with "near." Perhaps since the above mentions "small and great, long and short," this reference to "far-reaching" includes "near" as well. Otherwise, it would be a lapse in careful phrasing. Yet these scattered passages are exquisitely precise—how could others wield such a brush?

The Yellow Emperor roamed north of the Red Water, ascended the heights of Mount Kunlun, and gazed southward. Upon returning, he lost his Dark Pearl. He sent Knowledge to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Li Zhu to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Chi Gou to seek it, but it was not found. Then he sent Indistinct, and Indistinct found it.

The Yellow Emperor said: "How extraordinary! Could only Indistinct obtain it?"

This passage speaks of seeking the Dao: it does not lie in cleverness, nor in eloquence—just as the Buddhist sutras say, "To seek the Great Perfect Enlightenment with a thinking mind is like trying to burn Mount Sumeru with a firefly’s glow." Yet it unfolds such a discourse.

The Dark Pearl is the Dao. *Knowledge* is perception. *Li Zhu* is clarity. *Chi Gou* is eloquence. *Indistinct* is absence of mind. Perception, clarity, and eloquence cannot attain the Dao; only with absence of mind is it obtained. Such metaphors are truly extraordinary.

Yao’s teacher was Xu You; Xu You’s teacher was Nie Que; Nie Que’s teacher was Wang Ni; Wang Ni’s teacher was Pi Yi.

Yao asked Xu You: "Could Nie Que be fit to rule as Heaven?" "I would summon Wang Ni to inquire."

Xu You said: "How perilous it would be for the world! Nie Que’s nature is keenly perceptive, quick-witted, and sharp—his abilities surpass others, yet he still relies on human effort to align with Heaven. He is meticulous in restraining faults but does not understand their source. How could he be fit to rule as Heaven? He rides upon human affairs yet knows not the Heavenly; he takes himself as the root yet differs from other forms. He exalts his intellect and races like fire; he is driven by trivial matters and ensnared by things. He looks all around as things respond, adapts to every circumstance, and merges with things—yet has never known constancy. How could he be fit to rule as Heaven?

"Nevertheless, he has lineage and ancestry; he may serve as a father to the multitude but not as the father of fathers. He may lead order or chaos, yet bring calamity whether facing north or south."

Passage after passage unfolds, growing ever more wondrous—could one say the outer chapters are coarser than the inner?

*To rule as Heaven* is like the saying in the *Book of Documents*, "The rites of Yin ascend to match Heaven," meaning to govern the world. *Summon* means to invite. *Perilous* and *danger* both signify risk. *Keen perception and wisdom* are his nature. *Quick* means nimble; *sharp* means swift in response. His nature is agile, so he responds with alacrity—this is how he surpasses others. He cultivates human affairs to accord with Heavenly principle, hence "relies on human effort to align with Heaven." *Meticulous* means clear. *Restraining faults* is like holding the mind without transformation. If one understood the source of faults, there would be no need for restraint.

*Riding upon human affairs yet knowing not the Heavenly* means exhausting one’s efforts in action without understanding non-action. *Riding* means to act, to engage in human affairs. *Self* refers to me; opposing things, it is called "taking oneself as the root yet differing from other forms." *Racing like fire* describes haste. Exalting one’s intellect and using it urgently is called "exalting intellect and racing like fire." *Trivial matters* are the ends. Being enslaved by ends without knowing the root is called "driven by trivial matters," implying fragmentation. *Ensnared by things* means being constrained by affairs and objects. Things come from all four directions, and he looks around to respond—hence "looks all around as things respond." Adapting to each situation and measuring its fitness is called "adapting to every circumstance." Losing one’s natural constancy by being swept away by things is not true responsiveness—hence "merging with things yet never knowing constancy." *Merging* means being altered by affairs and objects. *Constancy* means unity. *Never knowing constancy* means having no stability.

Seven "he is" and seven "just then" in succession—where in ancient or modern times has such prose been seen?

Yet it turns again: though he may not be fit to rule as Heaven, there is still something worthy of reverence. A clan gathers and honors its ancestors—hence "has lineage and ancestry." These four casual words are also extraordinary. *A father to the multitude* means rising above others to guide them. The *father of fathers* is even higher—the father of fathers is Heaven, the natural. *Lead* means to command; this person’s role in the world may bring order or chaos. *Facing north* is the minister; *facing south* is the ruler. To make this the way of minister or ruler invites disaster—hence "calamity whether facing north or south."

Yao observed Hua, and the border guard of Hua said: "Ah! Sage!"

The border guard offered blessings to the sage, wishing him long life. Yao declined. He wished him wealth. Yao declined. He wished him many sons. Yao declined.

The border guard said: "Long life, wealth, and many sons—these are what all men desire. Why do you alone not desire them?"

Yao replied: "Many sons bring many fears; wealth brings many troubles; long life brings many humiliations. These three are not what nurture virtue—hence I decline."

The border guard said: "At first, I took you for a sage, but now you are merely a gentleman. Heaven gives life to the people and must assign them their duties. If you have many sons and assign them duties, what fear is there? If you are wealthy and distribute it among others, what trouble is there? Long life, wealth, and many sons are what all men desire, yet those who study the Way regard them as unworthy of concern. Zhuangzi turns this on its head, revealing his loftiness. 'Heaven gives life to the people and must assign them their duties'—this is like a child falling to the earth and already having clothing and food, the natural allotment of mountains and valleys, as in the saying 'a hundred grasses grieve in the spring rain.' 'Wealthy and distributing it among others' means entrusting it to each person.

The sage dwells like a quail and eats like a fledgling, moving like a bird without leaving a trace. When the world follows the Way, all things flourish together; when the world loses the Way, he cultivates virtue and retreats to leisure. After a thousand years, weary of the world, he departs and ascends as an immortal, riding the white clouds to the realm of the Emperor. The three afflictions never reach him, and his body remains free from harm—what humiliation can there be?

'Dwelling like a quail' means having no fixed abode. 'Eating like a fledgling'—the young bird is fed by its mother, though it eats, it does not seek food itself, meaning it is without concern for sustenance. 'Moving like a bird' means flying. 'Without leaving a trace' means having no attachments, dwelling wherever one finds oneself. 'All things flourish together' means each thing and I attain our respective lives. 'Cultivating virtue and retreating to leisure' means withdrawing when the state lacks the Way. 'Weary of the world and ascending as an immortal' expresses the idea of liberation. 'White clouds and the realm of the Emperor' refer to the heights of emptiness. The 'three afflictions' are youth, adulthood, and old age—the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*'s metaphor of the Ganges' waters. 'The body remains free from harm' means self-contentment.

Above, he spoke of long life, wealth, and many sons; below, he reverses the order, placing long life last, and the rhetoric grows more expansive—this is the pivot of the text’s artistry.

The border guard departed, and Yao followed, saying: 'May I ask a question?' The border guard replied: 'Withdraw.' Yao still wished to ask, but the border guard did not answer, merely saying 'withdraw,' as if to say, 'Go away.' Jie Yu hurriedly avoided him; the old man with the staff left upon arrival. Master Cheng could not share a boat with such a one—all these are instances of this mechanism.

Yao governed the world, and Bo Cheng Zi Gao was established as a feudal lord. When Yao passed the throne to Shun, and Shun to Yu, Bo Cheng Zi Gao resigned his lordship to plow the fields. Yu went to see him and found him plowing in the wilds. Yu hastened to stand downwind and asked, standing: 'In the past, when Yao governed the world, you, sir, were established as a feudal lord. When Yao passed the throne to Shun, and Shun to me, you resigned your lordship to plow. May I ask the reason?'

Bo Cheng Zi Gao said: 'In the past, when Yao governed the world, he did not reward, yet the people were encouraged; he did not rage, yet the people were awed. Now you employ punishments, and the people grow unkind. Virtue has declined from this point, and penal law has been established from this point—from here, the disorders of later ages begin. Sir, why do you linger? Do not interfere with my work.'

He bent low to his plowing and did not look back. This passage speaks again of the world’s decline, each era worse than the last—even in Yu’s time, it was not as in Yao and Shun’s. 'Do not interfere with my work'—*luò* means 'to neglect'; he said he had no time to speak with Yu, lest he neglect his plowing. *Yìyì* describes the posture of bending low to plow.

Yao did not reward or punish, yet now you reward and punish, and the people grow unkind. His meaning is that rewards and punishments are not as good as their absence—like the idea that litigation should ideally not exist. Yet he uses the names of Yao, Shun, and Yu to make his point.

In the Great Beginning, there was nonbeing; there was no being, no name. The One arose from this—there was the One, yet no form. Things obtained it and were born—this is called *power*. Before form, there were divisions, yet they were seamless—this is called *fate*. Movement abided and gave birth to things; things formed and possessed the principle of life—this is called *form*. Form and spirit preserved each other, each with its own pattern—this is called *nature*. When nature is cultivated, it returns to power; when power reaches its fullness, it is one with the beginning. Being one is emptiness; emptiness is vastness. Harmonizing with the cries of the world, the cries of the world harmonize with it, joining with Heaven and Earth. This joining is profound, appearing foolish and dull—this is called *mysterious power*, one with the Great Compliance.

'The Great Beginning' is the inception of creation. What existed was only nothingness—there was not yet even the word 'being.' If being were like nonbeing, how could there be a name? This is the origin of the One. This 'One' is the word 'nothingness,' hence 'there was the One, yet no form.' Things obtained it and were born—then there was being. All things possess their own being—this is *power*. 'Before form' refers to the moment when the One arose. Though there were divisions, they could not be separated, hence 'seamless.' *Qiěrán* means 'just so,' and the word *qiě* is often followed by another character. 'Seamless' means undifferentiated; 'having divisions' means distinct—this 'fate' is the mandate of Heaven that gives rise to nature.

'Movement abided and gave birth to things'—the primordial *qi* moved ceaselessly, and when its movement abided in a place, it gave birth to things. Hence 'movement abided and gave birth to things.' The phrase 'movement abided' is profoundly subtle—do not read it carelessly. 'Movement' is yang; 'abided' is stillness, and stillness is yin. This line already contains the idea of yang generating and yin completing. Things obtain it and are born; once formed, they possess the principle of life. The movement of primordial *qi* becomes my life—this is called *form.*"

Observe how the character *xing* (形, "form") is explained here—this is found nowhere else in other texts. "Form and body preserve the spirit, each possessing its own norms and patterns, which is called *xing* (性, nature)." This single phrase corresponds to the *Book of Poetry*'s "There are things, there are norms," and to the *Zuozhuan*'s statement that "the people receive the mean of Heaven and Earth, thereby possessing the norms of movement, action, dignity, and propriety." "Form and body" are *qi*; within *qi* resides the spirit, and the so-called norms and patterns are all brought forth by this spirit—this is the idea that within *xing* naturally reside benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom.

If we discuss this in terms of my own work, the first of these four phrases should replace the character *ban* (搬) with *xing* (性), and this *xing* refers to the functioning of nature. Thus, one must regard the meanings of the characters in this text as a single, unified vision. "*Xing* cultivated returns to *de* (德, virtue/power)" means that by cultivating this *xing*, one restores its natural *de*. When *de* reaches its utmost perfection, one becomes identical to the state before the existence of things. "Returning to *de*" is akin to "returning to *li* (禮, ritual)." "Utmost" means "to reach." To be identical to the state before the existence of things is to be empty; emptiness is vastness, and vastness is speech without words.

"Closing the beak" is silence; "chirping" is speech. The three characters following "speech without words" mark the text’s extraordinary flourish. Below, however, the phrasing turns again, stating, "the beak’s chirping closes"—here, the character *he* (合, "close/unite") differs from the earlier *he*. This means that when the beak’s chirping speaks through silence, it unites with the natural. Through this natural union, it unites with Heaven and Earth. Hence, it is said, "the beak’s chirping closes, uniting with Heaven and Earth." *Minmin* (缗缗) is like *minmin* (泯泯), describing a state of seeming foolishness or dullness—this depicts the character *he* (合). This is what is called the wondrous and subtle *de*, which is identical to the Great Compliance. The Great Compliance is the principle of the Great Beginning’s spontaneity.

Confucius asked Lao Dan: "There is a man who governs the Dao as if imitating others—affirming the unconfirmable, agreeing with the disagreeable. A debater once said, 'Separate hardness and whiteness, as if suspended in midair.' Could such a one be called a sage?" Lao Dan replied: "This is like a clerk or artisan bound by skill, laboring the body and startling the mind. A dog kept to catch raccoons becomes anxious; a monkey’s agility brings it from the mountains. Qiu, I tell you what you cannot hear and speak of what you cannot utter. All those with heads and feet but no heart or ears are many; those with form and those without form or shape who all exist are entirely absent. Their movement and stillness, their life and death, their decline and rise—these are not their true causes.

There is governance in man: forget things, forget Heaven, and it is called forgetting the self. One who forgets the self is said to enter into Heaven. 'As if imitating' refers to the idea that emperors and kings share the same lineage and tribute. By my affirmation, I clarify their negation; by my agreement, I clarify their disagreement. Though the debater’s words—hardness and whiteness, sameness and difference—are tangled and multifarious, I can distinguish them as if suspended in the sky, clearly revealing them to others. *Li* (離) means analysis. *Xuyi jixi* (胥易技系) has been explained in a previous section. *Chengsi* (成思) means being bound by others and thus becoming anxious. 'Coming from the mountains' means being captured and brought here. Earlier it said 'grasping the *zhi* (斄),' but here it says 'grasping the *li* (狸)'—*zhi* is a mistake.

'What cannot be heard, what cannot be spoken' refers to the idea that the *xing* and the Dao of Heaven cannot be heard. 'Having heads and feet' means that people share the same crown and heels. 'Without heart or ears' means they are without knowledge or perception. 'Without form or shape' refers to the spontaneous; from the realm of form, one sees the formless—this is 'those with form and those without form or shape who all exist.' This phrase is also remarkably crafted. 'Entirely absent' means no such person exists in the world. 'Movement and stillness' refer to daily life; 'decline and rise' refer to success and failure. Life and death, success and failure—all have their spontaneous causes. People know the movements and stillnesses, lives and deaths, declines and rises as such, but do not know their true causes.

Han Yu’s *Preface to Sending Wen Chang* says: 'The reason rivers flow, the reason beings flourish.' This too is an insightful remark, but people today read it carelessly. *Zhi* (治) refers to governance; *ren* (人) refers to human affairs. Governing through human affairs leaves no room for personal intent—hence, 'there is governance in man.' Not only does one forget things, but one also forgets Heaven—this is called forgetting the self. One who forgets the self has no self. 'Entering into Heaven' means entering into spontaneity, akin to the earlier 'entering into the non-human.' Above it says 'forget Heaven,' and here it says 'enter into Heaven'—entering means uniting with Heaven, and only through forgetting can one achieve unity.

However, in *Responding to Emperors and Kings*, it says, 'Never yet has it emerged from the non-human'—this means one has not yet forgotten Heaven. 'Never yet has it entered into the non-human'—this means rising above creation. This differs from the phrase 'entering into Heaven.' These are all instances of the text’s dynamic flourishes; one must not cling rigidly to them, for clinging makes *Zhuangzi* difficult to read.

Jiang Lü Meng visited Ji Che and said: "The Lord of Lu told me, 'I request your instruction,' and I could not decline. Having already spoken, I do not know if it was appropriate—allow me to try presenting it. I told the Lord of Lu: 'You must practice reverence and frugality, promote those who are publicly loyal and free from partiality—then which of the people would dare not be harmonious?'" Ji Che laughed heartily and said: "If these are your words on the virtue of emperors and kings, it is like a mantis raising its arms to block a chariot wheel—it will surely fail. Moreover, if this is how you conduct yourself, you endanger your viewing platform, and many will come, treading in your footsteps."

Jiang Lü Meng, startled, said: "I am at a loss regarding your words."

Though so, I wish to hear the drift of your words.

To "present" means to set forth—allow me to set forth what I have said. "Promoting those who are publicly loyal" means to elevate the worthy. "Free from partiality" means to be without favoritism or cliques. "Harmonious" means at peace.

"Chuckling" describes the manner of laughter. The mantis raising its arms to block a chariot wheel speaks of strength too small to bear so great a task. We say "flaring into flight," we say "plants flaring into growth"—here, it speaks of "flaring its arms," for Master Zhuang delights in placing the word "flare" below.

"His self-made place" means the position he has made for himself. If he conducts himself thus, it is as if he endangers his viewing platform to display it to others—people will come and turn to him, and those who tread in his footsteps will grow ever more numerous.

"Many things" refers to the multitude of people. The implication is that the more his reputation flourishes, the more the world will flock to him, and thus he will burden himself.

"Startled" describes the manner of surprise. Hearing these words yet understanding nothing, he said he was utterly lost in what you had spoken.

The term "wind" here refers to the wind of legacy, much like saying "in brief." Ji Che said: When the great sage governs the world, he sways and stirs the people’s hearts, shaping their teachings and transforming their customs. The multitude abandons their predatory minds and advances their solitary aspirations—just as if it were their nature’s own doing, and the people know not how it came to be.

If this is so, how could he merely rank alongside Yao and Shun, humbly submitting to their teachings? He desires that all align with virtue, and thus his heart finds repose.

"Sways and stirs" means to shift and transform. "Predatory mind" refers to the mind of deliberate action. "Solitary aspiration" is the aspiration of solitary attainment—the "solitary" seen in "dawn clarity." Once the people have been shaped by teaching and their customs transformed, they all cast aside their private minds and advance toward the Dao, as if by the nature of innate knowledge, unaware of the ruler’s transformative influence. Thus it is said, "they know not how it came to be."

To regard Yao and Shun as superior and oneself as inferior is to call their teachings elder and one’s own younger. The implication is: How could Yao and Shun surpass me? I am not beneath them—yet the following phrase takes such a stance, which is rather striking. "Humbly submitting" carries the sense of bowing one’s head in deference. The word "people" here is synonymous with "person." If ordinary people could attain this, how could they willingly rank Yao and Shun’s teachings above their own and place themselves below?

When one aligns with the virtue of spontaneity, the heart finds peace. "Reposes" means to settle. "Desires" refers to the sage’s wish for the people to be thus.

Zigong traveled south to Chu and, on his return to Jin, encountered an old man in Hanyin who was tending his garden plots. He had dug a tunnel to enter the well, then hoisted a jar to draw water for irrigation, exerting great effort yet achieving little. Zigong said: "There is a device that can irrigate a hundred plots in a day, requiring little effort yet yielding great results. Would you not wish to use it?"

The gardener looked up and asked: "How does it work?"

Zigong replied: "Carve wood into a mechanism—heavy at the rear, light at the front. It draws water as if pulling, gushing forth like boiling water. It is called a well-sweep."

The gardener flushed with anger, his expression darkening as he laughed: "I have heard from my teacher that those who rely on machinery inevitably engage in mechanical affairs, and those who engage in mechanical affairs inevitably harbor a mechanical mind. When a mechanical mind resides in the breast, purity and whiteness are incomplete. When purity and whiteness are incomplete, the spirit is unsettled. One whose spirit is unsettled cannot bear the Dao. I am not ignorant of this—I am ashamed to do such a thing."

Zigong hung his head in shame and made no reply. After a pause, the gardener asked: "What are you doing here?"

Zigong said: "I am a disciple of Confucius."

The gardener replied: "Are you not that man of vast learning who emulates the sages, boasting to overshadow the crowd, strumming a lone zither and chanting mournful songs to peddle your reputation across the world? You should first forget your spirit and qi, cast aside your bodily form, and only then might you approach this. If you cannot even govern yourself, how can you presume to govern the world? Be on your way—do not hinder my work."

"Digging tunnels between plots" refers to creating water channels. "Pulling" means to draw up. "Gushing forth like boiling water" describes the ease of drawing water. These lines vividly depict the well-sweep’s efficiency.

"Machinery" refers to devices. Using them constitutes "mechanical affairs," and the mind that employs them is the "mechanical mind." A mechanical mind renders purity and whiteness incomplete, meaning it lacks undivided clarity. When the spirit is unsettled, one cannot embrace stillness and unity. "Cannot bear the Dao" means one cannot carry the Dao.

Such matters of learning and effort demand careful reflection.

"Who are you?" is akin to the *Analects*’ "Where are you from?" "Emulates the sages" means to admire the sages. "Boasting" describes an air of self-importance. "Strumming a lone zither and chanting mournful songs" refers to reciting and expounding when others do not understand—akin to striking a chime in Wei, though not quite the same. "Peddling reputation" means to seek fame.

"Forget your spirit and qi" is like saying "dismiss your cleverness." "Cast aside your bodily form" means to forget oneself. If you can do this, you may yet approach it. Otherwise, if you cannot even govern yourself, how can you govern others? These words mock our sage.

"Do not hinder" means "do not delay." Zigong, abashed and crestfallen, walked thirty *li* before recovering his composure.

His disciples asked: "Who was that man just now? Why did you change countenance and lose composure, unable to regain yourself for the rest of the day?"

Zigong replied: "At first, I thought there was only one man in the world—yet I did not know there was another like him. I have heard from the Master that in affairs, one seeks what is feasible; in achievements, one seeks completion; in effort, one seeks minimal labor for maximal results—this is the Way of the sage. But now, it is not so. One who holds to the Dao attains wholeness of virtue; one with wholeness of virtue attains wholeness of form; one with wholeness of form attains wholeness of spirit. Wholeness of spirit is the Way of the sage.

Entrusted with life, he moves among the people yet knows not where he goes—vast and perfectly whole! One must forget the mind of utility, skill, and craft.

"Crestfallen" describes a look of shame. "Abashed" conveys a sense of self-loss. "Unable to regain himself" means he did not return to his usual state. "One man in the world" refers to Confucius.

"In affairs, one seeks what is feasible" means to act only when it is proper. "Minimal labor for maximal results" is like the well-sweep. "Now, it is not so" refers to the uniqueness of the old man from Hanyin.

"Entrusted with life" means living in the world, moving among people yet unaware of his destination—like drifting without aim, reckless and unknowing. Thus it is said, "entrusted with life, he moves among the people yet knows not where he goes." "Perfectly whole" means pure and undivided. "Vast" describes a lack of form or trace.

"One must forget the mind of utility, skill, and craft" means this man’s heart surely holds no such things. Here, "forget" is synonymous with "absence." Such a man does not go where his aspirations do not lead, nor does he act where his heart does not incline.

Though the whole world praise him for attaining what he deems right, he remains aloof and unmoved; though the whole world blame him for losing what he deems right, he remains unperturbed and unshaken. Neither praise nor blame from the world can add to or take away from him—such is the man of perfect virtue. I, however, am but one tossed by the winds and waves of the world.

This man refers to the old man from Hanyin. He does not regard slander or praise as gain or loss; if even praise fails to sway him, how much less would blame? What he speaks and acts upon in the world is called "attaining what he deems right"; what he speaks and does not act upon is called "losing what he deems right."

Returning to Lu, he reported this to Confucius. Confucius said: "That man practices the great arts of the Primal Chaos. He grasps the one but knows not the two; he cultivates his inner self but neglects the outer. Now, one who embodies clarity to enter simplicity, who practices non-action to return to uncarved simplicity, who preserves his nature and embraces the spirit to wander among the common world—would you not be right to marvel at him? Moreover, the arts of Primal Chaos—how could you or I truly comprehend them?"

"Great" here means vast cultivation. "Primal Chaos" refers to the beginning of Heaven and Earth. "Arts" means the Dao. "Grasping the one" means holding to undivided purity; "knowing not the two" means the heart remains undivided. "Inner" refers to the original heart; "outer" refers to external things. "Clarity" allows one to enter simplicity—simplicity being uncarved simplicity. "Non-action" returns one to the natural state of uncarved simplicity. "Preserving nature" means keeping one’s nature whole; "embracing the spirit" means unity. "Would you not be right to marvel?"—"right" here means fitting, for you have not yet understood this Dao and thus fittingly find it strange.

When Zhun Mang journeyed east to the Great Abyss, he encountered Yuan Feng on the shores of the Eastern Sea. Yuan Feng asked: "Where are you going?" "To the Great Abyss," he replied. "What will you do there?" "The Great Abyss," said Zhun Mang, "is such that no matter how much flows into it, it never fills; no matter how much is drawn from it, it never empties. I shall wander there." Yuan Feng said: "Have you no concern for the people of the horizontal-eyed world? I wish to hear of sagely governance."

Zhun Mang said: "Sagely governance? It appoints officials without error, promotes the capable without oversight, fully perceives the true state of affairs, and acts accordingly. Words and deeds arise from self-interest, and the world is transformed. With a wave of the hand or a glance, the people of the four directions all come—this is sagely governance."

The "Great Abyss" is the great sea. "The people of the horizontal-eyed world" is a phrase coined to describe the common folk. "Wandering in the Great Abyss" means that the world is not worth observing, and one instead turns to the sea. "Appointing officials without error" means each fulfills their duty fittingly. "Promoting the capable without oversight" means no talent is overlooked. "True state of affairs" refers to concrete matters. Perceiving all that can be done and acting accordingly is called "fully perceiving the true state of affairs and acting accordingly." Words and deeds arise from self-interest, not for others, and the world naturally transforms. "Self-interest" means acting for oneself, not for others. "A wave of the hand" means stirring movement. With a gesture or glance, none fail to respond—this is recorded in the *Book of Documents*: "Only when moved does great response follow, fulfilling the will." "A wave of the hand or a glance" conveys the ease of command. Such is the governance of the sage over the world—referring to the ancient emperors and kings.

"I wish to hear of the virtuous man."

Zhun Mang said: "The virtuous man dwells without thought, moves without calculation, harbors no judgments of right or wrong, beauty or ugliness. Within the four seas, all share in his benefit and delight in his presence; all are provided for and find peace in his care. He is forlorn as an infant parted from its mother, disoriented as a traveler who has lost his way. Wealth and resources abound, yet he knows not their source; food and drink suffice, yet he knows not their origin. This is the bearing of the virtuous man."

"Dwelling and moving" refer to activity and stillness. Without concern for either, it is said he "dwells without thought, moves without calculation." "Harboring no judgments of right or wrong, beauty or ugliness" echoes the Buddhist teaching of "neither thinking of good nor thinking of evil." "Sharing benefit and provision" conveys the joy of mutual delight. "Forlorn" describes a desolate appearance. Like an infant parted from its mother or a traveler who has lost his way, he is detached from the world yet not without constraint. Wealth, resources, food, and drink all come to him unbidden—this is the mark of a heart without attachment. The virtuous man stands a level above sagely governance.

"I wish to hear of the spirit man."

The spirit man rides the light, vanishing with form—this is called "illuminating vastness." He fulfills destiny and exhausts feeling, so heaven and earth rejoice and the ten thousand affairs dissolve; the ten thousand things return to their true nature—this is called "primordial chaos."

"Spirit man" speaks of one whose spirit soars upward, transcending heaven and earth, so that even the light of sun and moon lies beneath him—thus he "rides the light." "Vanishing with form" means that though he has a body, it is as if he has none. "Illuminating vastness" describes his great clarity. "Fulfilling destiny" means attaining the utmost of heaven’s mandate. "Exhausting feeling" means fully realizing the feelings inherent in his nature—this "feeling" aligns with Mencius’ "if one follows one’s true feelings, one may do good." Delighting in the Way of heaven and earth, with no affairs to burden him, it is said that "heaven and earth rejoice and the ten thousand affairs dissolve." "Returning to true nature" means reverting to reality, so that when the ten thousand things all return to reality, they become one with him. "Primordial chaos" is the undifferentiated state, the so-called "Hundun."

The spirit man stands yet another level above the virtuous man. Such distinctions suggest that above the ancient sage-kings, there are those who remain beyond reach.

Menwugui and Chizhang Manji observed King Wu’s army. Chizhang Manji said, "Is he not inferior to the Lord of Yu? That is why he incurs this disaster." Menwugui replied, "Was the world well-governed before the Lord of Yu governed it? Or did he bring order only after chaos?" Chizhang Manji said, "A well-governed world is the universal wish—why calculate whether it was the Lord of Yu? The Lord of Yu was like a physician treating sores: applying a wig to a bald head, seeking a doctor for illness. A filial son prepares medicine to cure his compassionate father, yet his countenance remains distressed. The sage feels shame at this." Manji’s words imply that military conquest falls short of yielding and deference. In response to Menwugui’s question, he further criticizes the Lord of Yu, saying that while all desire a well-governed world, relying on the Lord of Yu’s governance only becomes a burden. "Without sores, what need is there for medicine? Without baldness, what use for a wig? Without illness, what need for a doctor?"—this suggests that calling governance "governance" is itself an affliction. Governing through non-action means no affliction exists. A filial son preparing medicine for his father still appears uneasy—how much better if the father were never ill? Thus, the sage deems those who act with intent to govern as bringing shame upon the world. Though his words are not orthodox, their metaphors are striking.

Cultivation signifies advancement, synonymous with shame—these characters were interchangeable in ancient script. "Deems them shameful" means deems them disgraceful. In the age of utmost virtue, worthies were not exalted, nor were the capable employed. Rulers were like bare branches, the people like wild deer: upright yet unaware of righteousness, affectionate yet unaware of benevolence, sincere yet unaware of loyalty, fitting yet unaware of trustworthiness, instinctively aiding one another without perceiving it as favor. Thus, their conduct left no traces, their affairs no records. The entire world, pure and undivided, bore no names of worthies or the capable—hence, "worthies were not exalted, nor were the capable employed." Bare branches refer to withered limbs, visible only in their boughs, devoid of leaves—an analogy for the absence of emotion and desire. Uprightness denotes self-cultivation; affection, mutual kinship. Sincerity in interaction is integrity, the heart’s expression is loyalty. Fitting action means affairs are aptly managed. The four "unawares" following uprightness indicate that in that era, there were no names for benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, or trustworthiness. "Instinctive movement" refers to all living people; "aiding one another" means mutual friendship and assistance. "Without perceiving it as favor" means without regarding it as grace. "Conduct left no traces, affairs no records" signifies that in that time, there were no matters of right or wrong, praise or blame. All this depicts the age of great antiquity.

A filial son does not flatter his parents; a loyal minister does not fawn upon his lord—this is the height of ministerial and filial devotion. Yet when a parent’s words are affirmed and their conduct deemed good, the world calls such a son unworthy. When a lord’s words are affirmed and their conduct deemed good, the world calls such a minister unworthy. But how can this be certain? When the world’s so-called "right" is affirmed as right, and its so-called "good" is deemed good, one is not called a sycophant. Is it then that worldly custom reveres parents and lords more strictly? To be called a flatterer provokes indignation; to be called a fawner elicits displeasure—yet one spends a lifetime flattering and fawning. One who neither flatters nor fawns can admonish their lord or father. To affirm whatever they say as right and whatever they do as good is to fail in admonition. In the case of lords and parents, admonition is deemed correct, and its absence incorrect. Yet in the world, one follows what is deemed good and affirms what is deemed right—does this not mean worldly custom reveres lords and parents less strictly?

This suggests that what people today call the Way is merely what the world collectively deems right, not something uniquely attained by the self, nor something that aligns with the Creator. "Guiding" means compliance; "flattery," obsequiousness. If what I call the Way merely aligns with worldly custom, then my conduct is nothing more than guiding and flattering the world. If others brand me a flatterer, I will surely resent it—yet my lifelong conduct cannot escape such a charge, for it cannot differ from worldly custom. The sage takes what is universally practiced as the Way, but Zhuangzi holds that the Way transcends the age, thus ranking the emperors and sages of antiquity a grade below. This passage unfolds with such force, its brushwork surging and irresistible—truly unmatched. Yet his words may err on the side of excess.

Gathering analogies and adorning words is to assemble the masses—yet beginning and end, root and branch, do not correspond. Donning robes and skirts, displaying colors, altering countenance to ingratiate an age, yet never calling oneself a guide or flatterer; aligning with others in right and wrong, yet never deeming oneself one of the common folk—this is the height of folly.

"Gathering analogies" means assembling the world’s metaphors to establish a doctrine. "Adorning words" means refining one’s rhetoric. "Assembling the masses" means drawing all scholars of the world to oneself. At the outset, the heart aspires to rise above the age, yet in the end, it cannot depart from the people of its time. Thus, beginning and end, root and branch, do not align—hence "do not correspond," meaning they do not match.

"Donning robes and skirts, displaying colors, altering countenance" refers to the Confucians’ attire and demeanor. "Colors" signify patterns. They methodically guide and instruct scholars, thus ingratiating themselves to the age. This is all a veiled critique of our sage. What one deems right, one’s disciples also deem right; what one deems wrong, one’s disciples also deem wrong. Those who study under one are all mediocre folk of the vulgar world. If one’s judgments align with theirs, then one is also a mediocre person. Yet to consort with mediocrity and not call oneself mediocre—this is the utmost stupidity, utterly lacking in discernment.

Zhuangzi’s intent is that what he alone has grasped, others do not know, and thus he differs from them. This gives rise to such resentful words, which are not sound argument. To know one’s own folly is not great folly; to know one’s own confusion is not great confusion. The greatly confused never awaken in their lifetime; the greatly foolish never gain insight. If one in three is confused, the path one seeks may still be reached, for confusion is slight. If two in three are confused, one labors in vain and does not arrive, for confusion prevails. But now the whole world is confused—though I have my own aspirations, how can they be realized? Is this not lamentable?

Grand music does not enter the ears of the village; the tunes *Zhe Yang* and *Huang Hua* make them burst into laughter. Thus, lofty words do not lodge in the hearts of the common folk; profound speech remains unspoken, for vulgar words prevail. If two jars and bells confuse, the path one seeks cannot be found. Now the whole world is confused—though I have my aspirations, how can they be attained? To know they cannot be attained and yet force the matter is yet another confusion.

Thus, it is better to let go and not press the point. If one does not press, who then shares the sorrow? To never awaken or gain insight is merely to lack self-knowledge.

"Aspirations" means direction. If two of three companions are confused, one still toils in vain and does not arrive. Now the whole world is confused by such doctrines—though I alone have a direction, how can I turn the age? This "I" is Zhuangzi speaking of himself. *Zhe Yang* and *Huang Hua* are names of rustic tunes. "Grand music" refers to ancient melodies, an analogy for his most profound teachings. That they "do not lodge in the hearts of the common folk" means his words do not penetrate. *Zhe Yang* and *Huang Hua* stand for vulgar speech. When vulgar speech prevails, profound words remain hidden.

"Dangling the heels" means sitting with feet hanging, unwilling to proceed. "Two dangling heels confused" refers to the earlier "two confused." "The path one seeks cannot be found" echoes the earlier "labor in vain and do not arrive." Scribal errors have rendered "dangling" as "jars" and "heels" as "bells," both unintelligible. Comparing the preceding and following phrases, "dangling heels" is clearly correct.

To know it cannot be attained and yet force the matter is yet another confusion—this is self-deception. Knowing it cannot be conveyed and yet insisting on conveying it adds another layer of confusion. "Let go" means to abandon it. "Not press" means not to insist on explaining. "Near" means close. To entrust it to silence is to avoid drawing near to sorrow—this is self-consolation.

A leper gives birth in the dead of night, hastily seizing a torch to examine the child, anxious lest it resemble himself. A "leper" is an evil person. The inserted "之" is like the earlier "骊之姬"—this is his stylistic pattern. An evil person fears his child will resemble him, for he knows his own wickedness. Yet those who are confused in the world do not know themselves and thus fall short even of the leper.

From the earlier "great confusion never awakens in a lifetime" and "great folly never gains insight," to these two analogies, the argument remains unresolved—this is mere literary play.

A century-old tree, split into sacrificial vessels, painted with green and yellow patterns—its offcut lies discarded in a ditch. Compared to the sacrificial vessel, the offcut in the ditch is one of beauty and ugliness, yet both have lost their original nature. Robber Zhi and the virtuous Zeng and Shi differ in conduct, yet all alike have lost their original nature.

Moreover, there are five ways to lose one’s nature: first, the five colors confuse the eyes, making them unclear; second, the five sounds confuse the ears, making them dull; third, the five odors choke the nose, congesting the sinuses; fourth, the five flavors cloy the mouth, making it numb; fifth, preferences and aversions agitate the heart, scattering the nature. These five are all harms to life, yet Yang Zhu and Mo Di strain to stand apart, claiming to have attained something—this is not what I call attainment.

If what is confined can be called attainment, then the owl in a cage may also be called attainment. The offcut in the ditch is the remnant of the tree split into sacrificial vessels. Though the same wood may be fashioned into a vessel or discarded in a ditch, its honor or disgrace differs, yet both are but withered wood—this is akin to the parable of the hidden grain and the lost sheep.

The five colors, five sounds, five odors, and five flavors are all products of human effort, thus they disrupt the nature. These four, along with preferences, are all denigrated.

"To be confined is to be obstructed and opposed by others. The central glabellum connects from the nose to the forehead. Alone, the mouth defiles its... Alas! *Lishuang* means deviation and loss. *Quhe* refers to judgments of right and wrong, preferences and aversions. When *quhe* muddles the heart, the natural nature is lost—thus it is said that *quhe* disturbs the heart, causing the nature to scatter and soar. The teachings of Yang Zhu and Mo Di are those that disturb the heart with *quhe*, yet they claim ability. They confine themselves with their doctrines and call it attainment. If this is called attainment, then beasts in cages may also be called attainment. This is a severe rebuke. (The variant *zhuokou* is incorrect.)

Moreover, preferences and aversions toward sounds and colors clutter the inner self, while *pibian*, *yuguan*, *jin hu*, and *shenxiu* constrain the outer. Internally, one is propped up by a wooden fence; externally, one is weighed down by snares. Bright-eyed within the snares, one yet claims attainment—this is like a criminal with bound arms and crossed fingers, or tigers and leopards trapped in sacks and cages, which may also be called attainment.

For their preferences and aversions manifest in speech and countenance, contending with others over right and wrong, their hearts become obstructed—thus it is said that preferences and aversions toward sounds and colors clutter the inner self. *Pibian*, *yuguan*, *jin hu*, and *shenxiu* are all the attire of the Confucians; clothing and conduct must be forcibly restrained by ritual—thus it is said to constrain the outer. *Jin* means to hold a *hu*; *shenxiu* refers to the long sash."

Within, one is crammed and congested as though by a wooden fence—this speaks of the lack of ease in the breast. Without, one is bound and constrained by ritual and decorum as though a criminal under restraint; *jijiao* refers to being tied with rope. *Huǎn huǎn* describes the appearance of gazing. Though others see one tormenting oneself as though in bondage, one yet claims attainment—would this be like a prisoner or a tiger in a sack and cage also claiming self-attainment?

To condemn Yang Zhu and Mo Di with such vehemence is excessive indeed. *Jiaobi* means to bind the arms; *lizhi* refers to the fingers being so tightly bound by rope that they may be counted. *Nang* and *kan* are spoken of together, much like the common saying of "a macaque in a sack."

**Outer Chapters: The Dao of Heaven**

The Dao of Heaven revolves without accumulation, thus all things are brought to completion. The Dao of the Thearch revolves without accumulation, thus the world submits. The Dao of the Sage revolves without accumulation, thus all within the seas obeys. One who is enlightened by Heaven and attuned to the Sage, whose six penetrations and four openings align with the virtue of thearchs and kings—such a one acts in profound obscurity, yet nothing is not at rest.

The stillness of the sage is not stillness for its own sake; it is good, and thus still. No thing suffices to disturb the heart, and so it is still. When water is still, it clearly reflects beard and brows, its level serves as a standard, and the great craftsman takes it as a model. If still water is so luminous, how much more so the spirit! The heart of the sage is still—it is the mirror of Heaven and Earth, the mirror of the ten thousand things.

The Dao of the Thearch and the Dao of the Sage are fundamentally difficult to distinguish. Zhuangzi’s intent is likely to regard the Thearch as the Three Sovereigns and the Sage as the Five Emperors. To revolve without accumulation is to be pure and unceasing. The phrase “without accumulation” makes this clearer. The central meaning of this passage, however, lies in the word *stillness*.

Within utmost stillness, revolving without accumulation—how could this be like withered wood or dead ashes? It is only that readers fail to perceive it. “Six penetrations and four openings” means unobstructed in all directions—east, west, south, north, above, and below. *Obscure* here carries the sense of *profoundly dark*. The sage’s stillness is not stillness for its own sake; it is good, and thus still—this line is most vital. It means the sage does not prize stillness as a virtue and thus seek it. No thing suffices to agitate the heart, so stillness is not pursued but arises naturally. *Disturb* is interchangeable with *agitate*.

The analogy of water and mirror for stillness is drawn from everyday speech, yet the phrasing is exquisitely precise. Now, emptiness, stillness, tranquility, quiescence, and non-action—these are the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth and the perfection of virtue and power. Thus thearchs, kings, and sages rest in them. To rest is to be empty; to be empty is to be full. What is full is ordered. To be empty is to be still; to be still is to move; to move is to attain. Stillness is non-action; in non-action, those who handle affairs bear responsibility. In non-action, one is at ease; at ease, one cannot be beset by care or calamity, and thus enjoys long life.

Emptiness, stillness, tranquility, quiescence, and non-action—these are the root of the ten thousand things. Understanding this and facing south, one becomes a ruler like Yao. Understanding this and facing north, one becomes a minister like Shun. Practicing this in a high position, one embodies the virtue of thearchs, kings, and Son of Heaven. Practicing this in a low position, one follows the Way of the dark sage and unadorned king. Retiring to leisurely wander rivers and seas, recluses of mountains and forests submit to this. Advancing to govern the world, one achieves great merit, renowned fame, and unifies all under Heaven.

Expanding the single word *stillness* into eight—emptiness, stillness, tranquility, quiescence, and non-action—clarifies its meaning. *Equilibrium* means *fixed*; *perfection* means *utmost*. This is the unchanging principle of Heaven and Earth, the ultimate in virtue and power. *Rest* means *to halt*. The hearts of thearchs, kings, and sages halt at this—akin to the saying “halt at utmost goodness.” To rest is to be empty, just as “only the Dao gathers in emptiness” and “auspiciousness halts where it halts.”

Yet what follows—“to be empty is to be full; what is full is ordered”—is even more incisive. “To be empty is to be full” is like the Chan saying that true emptiness gives rise to real existence. *Ordered* means *principle*; within true fullness, there is inherent pattern—this is radiance within undifferentiated wholeness. The previous line expounds “to be empty is to be full,” while the next speaks of “to be empty is to be still; to be still is to move.” This is the mutual rooting of movement and stillness. To move without failing to accord with what is fitting is called “to move is to attain.” “Those who handle affairs bear responsibility” means each fulfills their duty, achieving non-action yet nothing left undone.

*At ease* describes a state of bliss. “Cannot be beset by care or calamity” means not falling into distress; *beset* implies *sinking into*. Not entering into care or calamity is like the saying “the humane are without anxiety.” Long life is the reward of stillness. These four lines develop the idea of emptiness, stillness, and non-action—this is Zhuangzi’s literary method.

Here, the eight characters—emptiness, stillness, tranquility, quiescence, and non-action—are reiterated, concluding with “the root of the ten thousand things.” *Root* means *beginning*. This principle arises before the existence of the ten thousand things. Practicing this in a high position, one faces south as a ruler; in a low position, one does not serve. The *dark sage and unadorned king* refers to one who possesses the virtue of a sage but not the position. Retiring to leisurely wander is the path of the recluse; advancing to govern the world is the path of one who serves the times. Observe this line—how could its intent not be to engage with the world? How could it not regard movement and stillness as one?

Stillness makes one a sage; movement makes one a king. In non-action, one is revered; in simplicity, none under Heaven can rival its beauty. One who comprehends the virtue of Heaven and Earth—this is called the great root and great origin, harmonizing with Heaven. Thus one harmonizes and regulates all under Heaven, harmonizing with others. To harmonize with others is called human joy; to harmonize with Heaven is called Heavenly joy.

Stillness makes one a sage; movement makes one a king—this is the four characters *inner sage, outer king*. “In non-action, one is revered”: *revered* means *noble*, for no Dao under Heaven is more noble than non-action. *Simplicity* means *without adornment*. Though it may seem plain, none under Heaven surpasses its beauty, hence “in simplicity, none under Heaven can rival its beauty.” *Comprehends* means *clearly understands*. Knowing this virtue of Heaven and Earth, one may become Heaven’s companion, hence “harmonizing with Heaven.” *Harmonize* means *to unite*. *Great root and great origin* is praise for the virtue of spontaneity, akin to the idea of “self-rooted, self-so.” To harmonize and regulate all under Heaven is to unite with others—just as Yao said, “You are Heaven’s match.”

“For I am humanity’s match.” Having spoken of harmony with Heaven and harmony with humanity, the text now turns to *humanity delighting in Heaven’s delight*, its brushwork soaring and exultant—such is its general tenor.

Zhuangzi says: “My master! My master!”—who crushes nothing yet leaves no thing unblest, whose grace spans ten thousand ages yet claims no benevolence, who outlasts high antiquity yet boasts no longevity, who roofs and bears the cosmos, who carves and shapes the myriad forms yet lays no claim to artistry. This is called *Heaven’s delight*. These lines recur in the *Great and Venerable Master* chapter, though here they are prefaced with “Zhuangzi says.” Earlier they were the words of Xu You; now they are spoken as if by Zhuangzi himself. Clearly, every utterance is a parable—how could one take them as literal speech?

Thus it is said: One who knows *Heaven’s delight* moves in life as the heavens move, dies as things transform; in stillness shares the power of yin, in motion rides the wave of yang. Therefore, one who knows *Heaven’s delight* bears no resentment from Heaven, no blame from humanity, no burden from things, no reproach from spirits. Hence it is said: In action, one is Heaven; in stillness, one is Earth. With a single mind settled, one rules all under Heaven; no ghost brings misfortune, no soul grows weary. With a single mind settled, the myriad things submit. This speaks of extending the principle of emptiness and stillness to Heaven and Earth, penetrating the myriad things—this is called *Heaven’s delight*.

*Heaven’s delight* is the heart of the sage nurturing all under Heaven. *Heaven’s movement* means following the spontaneous pattern of Heaven’s principle. *Transformation of things* means changing with the myriad things. In stillness, one is yin; in motion, one is yang. *Riding the wave* means flowing together. The Confucian school speaks only of “not resenting Heaven, not blaming others,” but here two more phrases are added—*no burden from things, no reproach from spirits*—rendering the passage even more spirited. When ghosts manifest to humans, it is called *misfortune*; *no ghost brings misfortune* means the spirit is concealed and does not reveal itself. *No soul grows weary* means the spirit is not exhausted. *Ghosts* and *souls* refer to the spirit itself. When the mind is settled, the spirit is naturally settled, and the myriad things submit of themselves.

Extending the principle of emptiness and stillness to move among Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things—this is called *extending to Heaven and Earth and penetrating the myriad things*. *Nurturing all under Heaven* means governing the world by skillfully nourishing its people.

The virtue of emperors and kings takes Heaven and Earth as its model, the Dao and its power as its foundation, and non-action as its constant. In non-action, one employs all under Heaven with abundance; in action, one is employed by all under Heaven with insufficiency. Thus the ancients prized non-action.

When the ruler practices non-action, the subjects also practice non-action—this means the subjects share the ruler’s power, and when subjects share the ruler’s power, they do not serve as ministers. When the subjects act, the ruler also acts—this means the ruler shares the subjects’ path, and when the ruler shares the subjects’ path, he does not serve as lord. The ruler must practice non-action to employ all under Heaven; the subjects must act to be employed by all under Heaven—this is an unchanging principle.

The Dao of Heaven and Earth and the power of virtue are nothing but the principle of non-action. This passage contrasts non-action with action, taking non-action as the ruler’s path and action as the minister’s path. *When subjects share the ruler’s power, they do not serve as ministers* means ministers should labor. *When the ruler shares the subjects’ path, he does not serve as lord* means the lord should be at ease. *Employing all under Heaven* is the role of the ruler; *being employed by all under Heaven* is the role of the minister. This discussion of lord and minister presents yet another perspective, distinct from the *Heaven’s Dao, Humanity’s Dao* passage in *Preserving and Nurturing*. If one clings rigidly to such distinctions, one cannot read Zhuangzi.

Moreover, though this chapter states that the ruler should practice non-action while the minister should act, an earlier passage says, “Understanding this and facing north, as Shun did when serving as minister,” and “Using this to advance and govern the age, one achieves great merit and renowned fame”—thus even the minister’s path is one of non-action. How could these teachings contradict one another? Therefore, if one reads Zhuangzi with such rigid adherence, one will fail to grasp his meaning.

Thus the ancient rulers of all under Heaven, though their knowledge encompassed Heaven and Earth, did not scheme for themselves; though their eloquence adorned the myriad things, they did not delight in themselves; though their abilities exhausted the realm, they did not act for themselves. Heaven does not produce, yet the myriad things transform; Earth does not grow, yet the myriad things are nurtured; emperors and kings practice non-action, yet all under Heaven achieves success. Hence it is said: Nothing is more divine than Heaven, nothing richer than Earth, nothing greater than emperors and kings. Thus it is said: The virtue of emperors and kings matches Heaven and Earth. This is the Dao of riding Heaven and Earth, driving the myriad things, and employing the human realm.

*Encompassing Heaven and Earth* means embracing them—*embracing* and *encompassing* share the same meaning. *Adorning the myriad things* refers to their artistry. The myriad things generate themselves, not by Heaven’s production; they grow themselves, not by Earth’s growth. Thus it is said: Heaven does not produce, Earth does not grow. Emperors and kings achieve the world’s success through non-action, aligning with Heaven and Earth. *Riding Heaven and Earth* is like saying “riding the six dragons to govern Heaven”; *driving the myriad things* means commanding the moving multitude.

This passage simply praises the ruler’s path of non-action. Its essence lies in the ruler; its details lie in the minister. What matters is the lord; what is elaborated is the minister. The deployment of the three armies and five weapons is the outermost expression of virtue; rewards and punishments, benefits and harms, the five punishments—these are the outermost expression of teaching. Rituals, laws, measures, punishments, names, and detailed comparisons—these are the outermost expression of governance. The sounds of bells and drums, the forms of feathered banners—these are the outermost expression of music. Wailing and mourning, the gradations of mourning attire—these are the outermost expression of grief. These five outer expressions require the movement of spirit and the activation of the mind’s art before they can be followed.

Such outer expressions were practiced by the ancients, but they are not what should come first. From this point onward, the text again discusses action, for non-action is the root, while action is the branch. What matters is the ruler’s path of non-action; what is elaborated is the minister’s path of action. The assistance of martial and civil virtue—hence it is said: *The deployment of the three armies and five weapons is the outermost expression of virtue*. The *five weapons* are the bow, shield, spear, dagger-axe, and halberd.

The clarification of punishments assists instruction, hence it is said: rewards and penalties, advantages and harms, the five punishments and their applications—these are the outermost expression of teaching. Measurements and gradations are matters of rank and distinction; penal codes and names are matters of nomenclature. *Bi* means classification by analogy; *xiang* means meticulous detail. Ritual laws, measurements, bells, drums, plumes, and banners—none of these are the root of ritual and music. It is like saying: "Are jade tablets and silk, bells and drums the essence of ritual and music?" The outermost expression of grief likewise embodies the meaning of "rather sorrow than ease."

These several lines are most balanced. The movement of spirit and the activation of the mind’s art must come first, for all proceed from the inner heart and are not imposed from without. That the ancients practiced these outer expressions does not mean they should come first—this line is particularly fine, for it shows that Zhuangzi never intended to entirely abandon weapons, punishments, ritual, or music.

The ruler leads and the minister follows; the father leads and the child follows; the elder brother leads and the younger follows; the elder leads and the younger follows; the man leads and the woman follows. This hierarchy of honor and precedence is the course of Heaven and Earth, and thus the sage takes it as his model. Heaven is honored and Earth is lowly—such is the positioning of the numinous. Spring and summer come first, autumn and winter follow—such is the sequence of the four seasons. The transformations and creations of the myriad things, their sprouting forms and distinct shapes, their waxing and waning, their flowing changes—all these too are the course of Heaven and Earth. If even Heaven and Earth, most numinous of all, possess this order of honor and precedence, how much more should the human Dao?

In ancestral temples, kinship is honored; in court, honor is given to rank; in village communities, age is honored; in affairs of state, worth is honored—this is the sequence of the Great Dao. To speak of the Dao while violating its sequence is not the Dao. To speak of the Dao while misrepresenting the Dao—how can one claim to grasp the Dao?

Following the contrast of "leading" and "following," the text offers many analogies. It means that what should lead must lead, and what should follow must follow—all is the natural principle of Heaven and Earth. Thus the sage takes it as his model, saying: "The hierarchy of honor and precedence is the course of Heaven and Earth, and the sage takes it as his model." The analogies of Heaven, Earth, and the four seasons serve to illustrate this. *Huazuo* means transformation and generation—like the line in the *Book of Songs*: "The fern also sprouts." *Meng* means sprouting; *qu* means differentiation. It speaks of things being born with different forms. Changing with the seasons, first flourishing then declining, this too is an analogy. The sequence of precedence and the gradations of decline are matters of degree. What flourishes does not flourish all at once, nor does what declines decline all at once—all follows an order, hence it is called "the gradations of flourishing and decline."

From the sequence of precedence, the text moves to honor and lowliness, for honor and lowliness are also matters of precedence. "In affairs of state, worth is honored" means that in assigning duties, the worthy take precedence. Age, rank, kinship, and worth—these too are the natural principles of the world, hence they are called "the sequence of the Great Dao." "How can one claim to grasp the Dao?" means that if one does not know this sequence, how can one possess the Dao?

Thus those in antiquity who illuminated the Great Dao first illuminated Heaven, then virtue/power followed; once virtue/power was illuminated, benevolence and righteousness followed; once benevolence and righteousness were illuminated, the division of duties followed; once the division of duties was illuminated, forms and names followed; once forms and names were illuminated, the assignment of tasks followed; once the assignment of tasks was illuminated, investigation and reduction followed; once investigation and reduction were illuminated, right and wrong followed; once right and wrong were illuminated, rewards and punishments followed. Once rewards and punishments were illuminated, the foolish and the wise were placed appropriately, the noble and the base occupied their proper positions, the benevolent and the worthless each settled into their true natures. Abilities were distinguished, names were adhered to, and with these one served superiors, nurtured inferiors, governed things, and cultivated the self. Scheming and planning were set aside, and all necessarily returned to their Heavenly nature. This is called the ultimate state of Great Peace and governance.

This passage describes the sequence of governance, comprising nine levels. Heaven is first, virtue/power second, the seven virtues (benevolence and righteousness) third, the division of duties fourth, forms and names fifth, the assignment of tasks sixth, investigation and reduction seventh, right and wrong eighth, and rewards and punishments ninth. *Fenshou* means official duties; *xingming* refers to external designations (the character *xing* is interchangeable with *xing*, meaning "form"). *Yinren* means assigning great tasks based on one’s duties. *Yuan* means exemption; *sheng* means reduction—if one is not suited to a task, they are exempted or removed. *Shifei* means distinguishing the good from the bad. *Shangfa* refers to punishments like flogging or rewards like chariots and robes to make them known.

Zhuangzi’s account of the sequence of governance is thus, yet how can it be said that Heaven’s punishment of the guilty and Heaven’s mandate to the virtuous—how can rewards and punishments not be of Heaven? Why must one go through nine transformations before reaching them? Such reasoning strays far from the sages. Yet to say "first illuminate Heaven, then virtue/power," and then proceed through these several stages is not a matter of abandoning the coarse to seek the refined.

"The foolish and the wise are placed appropriately" means being suited to their tasks. *Lüwei* likewise means being in one’s proper position. *Xi* means to settle—settling into one’s true nature means the noble and the base each have their place. "Names are adhered to" means demanding reality in accordance with names. "Scheming and planning are set aside, and all necessarily return to their Heavenly nature" means that though each matter has its place, there is no room for contrivance—all returns to spontaneity. This is the age of Great Peace.

Thus the *Book* says: "There are forms and names." Forms and names were practiced by the ancients, but they are not what should come first. Those in antiquity who spoke of the Great Dao underwent five transformations before forms and names could be established, and nine transformations before rewards and punishments could be discussed. To abruptly speak of forms and names is to ignore their root. To abruptly speak of rewards and punishments is to ignore their beginning. To speak of the Dao in reverse or to expound it perversely is what others may govern, but how can one govern others?

To abruptly speak of penal codes, names, rewards, and punishments is to possess the tools of governance but not the Dao of governance. Such a one may be employed by the world but cannot employ the world—this is called a disputatious scholar, a man of partial understanding. Ritual laws, measurements, penal codes, classifications, and meticulous details were practiced by the ancients, but these are what inferiors use to serve superiors, not what superiors use to nurture inferiors.

The texts are ancient writings. Though they contain discussions of forms and names, they never abandon the root to pursue the branches—thus they are not what should come first. If one does not know the proper sequence and speaks of them abruptly, one loses their fundamental origin. "Inverted" means to place things upside down; "perverse" means to go against the natural order. If one reverses this natural Dao or inverts its teachings, one becomes governed by others—used by the world rather than using the world. To regard penal codes, names, rewards, and punishments as the tools of governance, and to divide and uphold benevolence and righteousness as the Dao of governance—where is the error in this? Only that the exposition becomes convoluted. "Partial" means one-sided. What superiors use to nurture inferiors is the way of the ruler; what inferiors use to serve superiors is the way of the minister.

Formerly, Shun asked Yao, "How does the Son of Heaven employ his heart-mind?" Yao replied, "I do not slight the destitute, nor abandon the impoverished. I grieve for the dead and commend the young, pitying widows—this is how I employ my heart-mind." Shun said, "Admirable as this is, it is not yet great." Yao asked, "Then what should it be?" Shun said, "Let virtue emerge in tranquility, like the sun and moon shining and the four seasons proceeding. As day and night follow their constant course, clouds move and rain falls." Yao said, "Then I am but restless and troubled! You are in accord with Heaven; I am in accord with man." Now, Heaven and Earth are what the ancients deemed greatest, what the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun all esteemed. Thus, those who ruled all under Heaven in ancient times—what did they do? They simply followed Heaven and Earth.

"Slight" means to treat with contempt; "grieve" means to feel compassion. "Commend" means to approve. "Widows" refers to women without husbands. Though the term "widow" is not used, it is implied by the pairing with "the young." "Heavenly virtue" is the virtue of nature. "Emerging in tranquility" means to rise above all things so that the myriad states are at peace. As the sun sets, the moon rises; as cold departs, heat arrives—this is the sun and moon shining and the four seasons proceeding. Day follows night, and night follows day, ever constant—this is the meaning of "course." Clouds move and rain falls, following the seasons naturally—all this illustrates the idea of acting without contrivance. "Restless and troubled" describes disorder. Yao said his actions fell short of Shun’s, for he could not avoid self-generated disorder, and thus he was in accord only with man, not with Heaven. The next three sentences are Yao’s self-deprecating words.

"Heaven and Earth are what the ancients deemed greatest"—this means the principle of Heaven and Earth, from ancient times to the present, has been the greatest of all. "All esteemed" means all cherished it. Those who ruled all under Heaven did nothing else but model themselves on Heaven and Earth. The earlier praise and criticism of Yao and Shun, followed by their equal mention alongside the Yellow Emperor, show no distinction in weight. If one clings to their names and words, one will be obstructed and unable to proceed.

Confucius traveled west to deposit his writings in the Zhou archives. Zilu counseled, "I have heard that in Zhou there is a keeper of the archives named Lao Dan, who has retired and now lives in seclusion. If you wish to deposit your writings, you might visit him and seek his aid." Confucius said, "Very well." He went to see Lao Dan, but Lao Dan refused his request. Thereupon, Confucius expounded the Twelve Classics to persuade him. Midway through, Lao Dan interrupted, saying, "This is too prolix—pray tell me the essentials." Confucius replied, "The essentials lie in benevolence and righteousness." Lao Dan asked, "Are benevolence and righteousness part of human nature?" Confucius said, "Indeed. The noble person who lacks benevolence cannot achieve completion, and without righteousness, cannot live. Benevolence and righteousness are the true nature of humanity—what more could one do?" Lao Dan said, "I ask what you mean by benevolence and righteousness." Confucius replied, "To delight in all things with a harmonious heart-mind, to love universally without partiality—this is the essence of benevolence and righteousness." Lao Dan said, "Alas! These are but shallow words. Is not universal love impractical? To claim impartiality is itself partiality. If you wish to ensure that all under Heaven do not lose their proper nurture, know that Heaven and Earth have their constancy, the sun and moon their brightness, the stars and constellations their order, birds and beasts their flocks, and trees their uprightness. You too should emulate virtue and act, follow the Dao and proceed—you have already arrived. Why then do you laboriously brandish benevolence and righteousness, as if beating a drum to seek a lost child? Alas! You confuse human nature."

"Traveled west to deposit his writings in the Zhou archives" means he went west to Zhou to examine its archival texts. "Expounded" means to explain repeatedly. "Midway through" means Laozi found the discourse too verbose when only half complete. "Too prolix" means too diffuse. "Delight in all things" means to find joy in things and become one with them. "Shallow words" means superficial remarks. "Alas!" expresses concern. "Things are unequal"—how can one love them universally? This is an impractical and convoluted doctrine. To claim impartiality is to harbor partiality in one’s heart—this "impartiality" itself becomes a preoccupation, revealing an intentional mind. Thus, "to claim impartiality is itself partiality."

"Nurture" means to care for. If you wish to ensure that all under Heaven do not lose their proper care, know that all things between Heaven and Earth have their natural transformations—how can human effort intervene? One should only emulate natural virtue and follow the natural Dao—this is already perfection. Thus, "you have already arrived." "Lost child" refers to a runaway; beating a drum to seek one is to labor and disturb the world—this is to confuse human nature. Thus, Lao Dan spoke deceptively, saying, "Alas!" as if in reproach. "You" is a respectful term, like "my lord." "Laboriously" describes the appearance of exertion.

Shi Chengqi visited Laozi and said, "I have heard that you are a sage, so I did not hesitate to travel a great distance to seek an audience. For a hundred days, with calloused feet, I dared not rest. Now I observe you and find you are not a sage. You have surplus grain in your rat holes yet abandon your younger sister—this is not benevolence."

The feast before him was not fully consumed, yet he hoarded without end. Laozi remained silent, offering no response.

The next day, Shi Chengqi visited again and said, "Yesterday, I reproached you, but now my heart has wholly receded—why is this?" Laozi replied, "The man of cunning knowledge and divine sagacity—I have long since transcended such. Formerly, when you called me an ox, I accepted it as an ox; when you called me a horse, I accepted it as a horse. If one truly possesses the reality, yet refuses the name others give, one invites double misfortune. My conduct is ever thus, not because I deem it right to act so. 'A hundred lodgings, calloused feet without rest'—this describes your toil. *Jun* refers to the thickened skin on the soles of the feet. To discard surplus food in the dark recesses of rat burrows, where light does not reach—*mei* shares the meaning of *mei* (obscurity), and this is to lack care for things, hence deemed unbenevolent. 'The feast before him was not fully consumed, yet he hoarded without end'—this speaks of his boundless accumulation. *Shengshu* refers to raw and cooked foods. What lies before one is not exhausted, yet he still gathers and stores without cease—thus, 'hoarding without end.' Laozi’s silence was his refusal to answer. *Ci* means reproach. *Que* means retreat. Formerly, there was reproach; now, his heart has wholly receded, as if, upon meeting, he suddenly awakened. *Qiaozhi* refers to the learning of divine sagacity through artificial means. *Tuo* means departure—transcending such. Since I am without fixed intent, whether you call me horse or ox, I merely listen. 'If one truly possesses the reality, yet refuses the name others give, one invites double misfortune'—this line is most pure. If I truly possessed such faults, and you reproached me, yet I resisted, this would be a twofold transgression—first the fault, then the denial. *Fu* means conduct. My actions are ever thus, not because I deem them right to act so—this is to act without self-awareness. Thus, 'My conduct is ever thus; I do not act because I deem it right to act.' This is akin to 'not saying stillness is good, yet stillness arises naturally.' The four *fu* characters below are all masterful strokes.

Shi Chengqi walked sideways, avoiding his shadow, treading step by step, gradually advancing, and asked how to cultivate the self. Laozi said, "Your countenance is haughty, your gaze piercing, your forehead prominent, your mouth agape, your demeanor rigid—like a horse tethered yet straining to bolt. In movement, you are restrained; in action, you are mechanical; in scrutiny, you are exacting; in knowledge, you are cunning, yet your bearing is overbearing. All this stems from a lack of sincerity. At the borderlands, such a man would be called a thief." *Yanxing biying* describes his sidling posture. *Lüxing* means stepping cautiously, one foot after the other; *lüxing suijin* depicts his gradual, hesitant advance. *Yairan* suggests an aloof, exceptional bearing. *Chongran* suggests a piercing, fixed stare. *Kanran* describes a gaping mouth. *Yiran* suggests rigidity. A horse’s nature is to run; though tethered, it still strains to bolt—this is the meaning of "sitting in restless motion," a most apt description. *Dong er chi* depicts restraint in movement. *Fa ye ji* refers to the trigger of a crossbow—his judgments are as swift and mechanical. *Cha er shen* means he is overly discerning and precise, lacking any concealment. *Zhi qiao er du yu Tai* means he relies on his cleverness, and his arrogance is plainly visible. These ten traits all arise from insincerity, hence "all stem from a lack of trustworthiness." *Buxin* means insincerity. If one perceived the true principle, these faults would vanish. At the borderlands, such a man would surely be branded a thief—his overactive scheming, his failure to follow the natural Way in life, invites disaster.

The Master said, "The Dao is not exhausted in the great, nor does it neglect the small—thus, the ten thousand things are complete. Vast and boundless, it embraces all; deep and unfathomable, it cannot be measured. Manifest virtue, benevolence, and righteousness are but the remnants of the spirit. Who but the perfected person can rightly discern this?" The Master is Laozi. "Not exhausted in the great" means it has no limit; "not neglecting the small" means it leaves nothing out—this echoes the saying, "In speaking of the great, nothing can contain it; in speaking of the small, nothing can break it." No thing lies beyond the Dao, hence "the ten thousand things are complete." *Guangguanghu* means vastness. *Yuanhu* means depth. When the spirit takes form as virtue, benevolence, and righteousness, these are but its secondary manifestations. *Xing* means manifestation; *shen* means the wondrous function. *Ding* means to discern rightly. Who but the perfected person can distinguish its root from its branches?

"The perfected person possesses the world—is this not grand? Yet it does not burden him. Though the world seizes power, he does not join in its pursuits. He discerns the unreal and does not shift with profit. He exhausts the truth of things and guards their root—thus, he puts heaven and earth aside, leaves the ten thousand things behind, and his spirit is never constrained. In harmony with the Dao, aligned with virtue, he sets aside benevolence and righteousness, treats ritual and music as guests—such is the settled mind of the perfected person." *You shi* means possessing the world. Though he holds the world’s vastness, it does not burden his heart. *Bing* means power. Though the world seizes power, his heart does not follow—this means his mind is unmoved. *Bu wei li qian* means he does not calculate profit and loss. He exhausts the true principle of things, thus guarding their inherent stillness. *Wai tiandi, yi wanwu*—he is unmoved by externals. With his mind unmoved, how can his spirit be constrained? *Tong* means unity. *Daode* means naturalness. *Tui renyi* means treating benevolence and righteousness as secondary, not primary. *Bin liyue* means regarding emotions and nature as primary, with ritual and music as secondary.

Stillness is stability. This is how the mind of the perfected person attains stillness and stability. What the world values in the Dao is the written word. Yet writing is but speech, and speech has its value. What is valued in speech is meaning. Meaning has its source, but what meaning follows cannot be transmitted through words. The world, however, prizes the transmission of words through writing. Though the world values it, it is still not truly worthy of value—for what it values is not what should be valued.

Thus, what can be seen are forms and colors; what can be heard are names and sounds. How lamentable that the world believes forms, colors, names, and sounds suffice to grasp the true nature of things. If forms, colors, names, and sounds indeed cannot grasp that nature, then the wise do not speak, and those who speak are not wise—how could the world recognize this?

Writing can convey the Dao, which is why the world values it. Yet what is truly valued is the Dao, not the writing. When words express the Dao, they become valuable; but what is valuable is the meaning, not the words. *Sui* means direction. Where meaning directs itself, words cannot transmit it—thus neither words nor writing are truly worthy of value. To prize these is to prize what is not truly prized, hence it is said: "what it values is not what should be valued."

*Ming* refers to verbal expressions. Forms and colors can be seen, names and sounds can be heard—but does the Dao have form, color, name, or sound? That the world seeks to grasp its reality through seeing and hearing is truly lamentable. *Qing* means reality. *Guo* means certainty. Since seeing and hearing are certainly insufficient to grasp it, those who know the Dao do not speak, and those who speak do not know it. How could the world’s understanding reach this? This is why it is lamentable.

Duke Huan was reading in the hall while Wheelwright Bian carved a wheel below. Setting down his mallet and chisel, Bian went up and asked, "May I ask what Your Lordship is reading?" The Duke replied, "The words of the sages." Bian asked, "Are the sages still alive?" The Duke said, "They are already dead." Bian said, "Then what you are reading is but the dregs of the ancients."

The Duke said, "I am reading—how dare a wheelwright comment? If you have an explanation, fine; if not, you die." Wheelwright Bian said, "Your servant observes this from his own work. If the carving is too slow, it is smooth but not firm; if too fast, it is rough and does not penetrate. Neither too slow nor too fast—it is grasped by the hand and responds to the heart, yet the mouth cannot express it. There is a measure within, but I cannot explain it to my son, nor can my son receive it from me. That is why I am still carving wheels at seventy. The ancients and what they could not transmit are gone. Then what you are reading is but the dregs of the ancients."

This passage illustrates the earlier point—that the Dao cannot be transmitted through words—with an analogy so precise it is marvelous. *Gan* means smooth. *Ku* means rough. *Xu* means loose. *Ji* means tight. If too loose, it is smooth and easy to enter but not firm; if too tight, it is rough and hard to penetrate. The key is neither too loose nor too tight, for there is a proper measure within—yet it cannot be put into words. Even from father to son, it cannot be transmitted. Writing records the words of the ancients, but if the person is gone, how can what cannot be transmitted be obtained? Feeding on the dregs, how can one know the taste of wine?

If the Dao could be offered to others, none would fail to offer it to their lord; if it could be transmitted, none would fail to pass it to their children—this is the same idea. Generally, what is written in books does not pertain to a single matter. This text repeatedly expounds on the principle of naturalness, unfolding many words, growing ever more extraordinary, yet never departing from its single theme. Read in this way, the unmatched brilliance of Zhuangzi becomes ever clearer. The same holds for those who read Buddhist scriptures.

*End of the Fifteenth Scroll of the Oral Exegesis of the True Scripture of Southern Florescence*
*Beginning of the Sixteenth Scroll of the Oral Exegesis of the True Scripture of Southern Florescence*

The *Yanzhai* commentary by Lin Xi-yi on the "Outer Chapters: Heaven’s Motion":

Does Heaven move in its course? Does Earth abide in its place? Do the sun and moon contend for their positions? Who directs and sustains this? Who governs and orders this? Who, dwelling in non-action, yet propels and enacts this? Is it that some mechanism is at work, compelled by necessity? Or does it revolve ceaselessly, unable to halt itself?

Do clouds give rise to rain, or does rain give rise to clouds? Who causes them to swell and descend? Who, dwelling in non-action, indulges in excess and urges them on? Winds arise from the north, now west, now east, drifting upward in restless motion. Who breathes and draws them forth? Who, dwelling in non-action, yet scatters and stirs them?

These several lines are exquisite in every phrase—five instances of *hu* (乎), unmatched by any before or since. Heaven’s motion completes a circuit each day—is this its own self-motion? Earth has four directions and above and below—how could it remain fixed in place? To speak of the sun’s departure and the moon’s arrival as "contention" is to liken it to men vying for possession—who else could have coined these three words?

"Directing and sustaining" and "governing and ordering" both imply exertion. "A mechanism compelled by necessity" and "revolving ceaselessly, unable to halt itself" suggest that it is not subject to external control. Heaven’s *qi* descends, Earth’s *qi* ascends—thus clouds and rain are formed. But which gives rise to which: do clouds become rain, or does rain become clouds? Such a question is truly extraordinary.

"Swelling and descending" (*longshi*): *long* means to rise, *shi* means to cease. Like the alternation of tension and release, sometimes active, sometimes still—who brings this about? "Excessive indulgence" (*yinle*): *yin* means wantonness, *le* means play or amusement. "Urges" (*quan*) means to assist. Who engages in such unrestrained play and aids in the formation of clouds and rain?

Winds blow from all directions, but here it speaks of arising from the north—this follows the shape of Heaven, which leans toward the north, so winds naturally come from there. Sometimes west, sometimes east, sometimes above, sometimes below. "Restless motion" (*panghuang*) describes their coming and going; that it speaks only of "above" and not "below" is a matter of literary structure. "Scattering and stirring" (*pifu*) means to sway and agitate. One dares to ask: for what reason?

Wu Xian Shao replied: "Come, let me tell you."

The heavens possess the Six Ultimates and Five Constants; when rulers align with them, there is order, but when they defy them, there is calamity. In the affairs of the Nine Luo, governance is perfected and virtue is complete, illuminating the lands below, so that all under heaven revere them—this is called the Supreme Sovereign. The question is posed without naming the interlocutor, yet another shift in stylistic approach.

The Six Ultimates are the six qi; the Five Constants are the five phases. Both six qi and five phases are the principles of nature. The Nine Luo refer to the nine provinces. *Luo* means to gather or converge; *luo* and *luò* are interchangeable in ancient script. "Governance is perfected and virtue is complete" means that when rulers align with these natural principles to govern, the nine provinces achieve success and their virtue is fulfilled, shining upon all under heaven so that the people universally revere them. These are the men above even the Three Sovereigns, hence it is said: this is called the Supreme Sovereign.

The Grand Steward Dang of Shang asked Zhuangzi about benevolence. Zhuangzi replied: "Tigers and wolves—they are benevolent." Dang said: "What do you mean?" Zhuangzi said: "Father and son are affectionate toward one another—how is this not benevolence?" Dang said: "May I ask about perfect benevolence?" Zhuangzi said: "Perfect benevolence has no partiality." The Grand Steward said: "I have heard that without partiality there is no love, and without love there is no filial piety. Can it be said that perfect benevolence is unfilial?" Zhuangzi said: "It is not so. Perfect benevolence is lofty indeed; filial piety is simply insufficient to describe it. This is not a matter of surpassing filial piety, but of falling short of it. Comparing tigers and wolves to benevolence is akin to the idea that even bandits have their own Way. These are all arguments that reject and diminish the Confucian school, yet though their words may be biased, they still possess their own logic. As the saying goes, 'Even fierce tigers do not devour their young'—is this not the benevolence of tigers and wolves? 'Perfect benevolence has no partiality' means that benevolence is rooted in mutual affection, yet one does not recognize the source of that affection—this is called the perfection of benevolence. 'Filial piety is insufficient to describe it' does not mean it is unfilial, but rather that when it comes to perfect benevolence, filial piety need not even be mentioned. At its perfection, it transcends filial piety, surpassing it. As for the Grand Steward’s question, it merely falls short of filial piety. It is like saying, 'If you cannot fully exhaust the seven [virtues], then you fall short of filial piety; but if I can exhaust them, then I have surpassed it.' One who travels south to Ying, facing north yet unable to see Mount Ming—why is this? It is because the distance is too great. Thus it is said: Reverent filial piety is easy; loving filial pity is difficult. Loving filial piety is easy; forgetting one’s parents is difficult. Forgetting one’s parents is easy; making one’s parents forget you is difficult. Making one’s parents forget you is easy; forgetting all under heaven is difficult. Forgetting all under heaven is easy; making all under heaven forget you is difficult. The virtue of Yao and Shun was left behind, yet they did not act for its sake; their beneficence flowed through ten thousand generations, yet all under heaven remained unaware. How could one merely sigh and speak of benevolence and filial piety?

Filial piety, brotherly respect, benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, trustworthiness, integrity, and incorruptibility—these are all self-exhortations that serve to constrain one’s virtue; they are not worthy of praise. Thus it is said: The most noble—state rank is equaled by it. The most wealthy—state wealth is equaled by it. The greatest aspiration—fame is equaled by it. Therefore, the Way does not change.

Dark Mountain lies to the north; traveling south from the north to Ying, one no longer sees the northern mountains—this is because they have receded too far, not because they are out of sight. Such a trivial analogy, yet it serves to illustrate the idea that falling short of filial piety is not the same as surpassing it. Reverent filial piety still leaves traces, while loving filial piety leads to mutual forgetting. Beyond this lie "intent upon one’s parents," "forgetting all under heaven," and "all under heaven intent upon me." Each step must rise above the last—such is the stylistic method of this text. All things with traces are inferior to those without; all things with intent are inferior to those without.

To *leave behind* (遺) is to abandon, to disdain—disdaining even Yao and Shun as insufficient for virtue. Beneficence flowing through ten thousand generations is insufficient for benevolence; how then could one sigh and boast of mere filial piety and benevolence? Such sighs are but self-deception and vainglory.

Filial piety, brotherly respect, benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, trustworthiness, integrity, and incorruptibility—these eight are what the world deems fine virtues, yet in truth, they are but self-exhortations that weary one’s virtue. Thus it is said: "self-exhortations that constrain one’s virtue are not worthy of praise." *To constrain* (役) is to labor; *not worthy of praise* means not worthy of esteem. What need has my utmost nobility for state rank? What need has my utmost wealth for state riches? What need has my greatest aspiration for fame? *To equal* (并) is to cast aside—all are cast aside. Utmost nobility, utmost wealth, and greatest aspiration belong to the Dao of non-action. *State riches* refer to the wealth of the entire state. *Unchanging* means constant, that which is ever thus. The eight are acts of self-constraint through effort, while I remain ever in non-action.

Beigong Cheng asked the Yellow Emperor: "When you performed the *Xianchi* music in the wilds of Dongting, at first I heard it and was afraid; then I heard it again and grew weary; finally, I heard it and was bewildered. Adrift and silent, I could no longer find myself." This passage uses music to craft another striking discourse. First fear, then weariness, then confusion—such were the three transformations I underwent upon hearing this music. *Adrift* (荡荡) means the spirit scattered; *silent* (默默) means the mouth sealed. *Not finding oneself* means not feeling at ease, overwhelmed by the music’s awe.

The Emperor said: "You were nearly right. I performed it with human affairs, harmonized it with Heaven, conducted it with ritual and righteousness, and conveyed it through the Great Purity. The supreme music first responds to human matters, aligns with the principles of Heaven, proceeds through the five virtues, and accords with the natural—only then does it regulate the four seasons and harmonize the myriad things. The four seasons arise in succession, and the myriad things follow their growth. One flourishes, one declines; civil and martial follow their order. One clears, one muddies; yin and yang attain harmony. Its sound flows luminously, and hibernating creatures stir as I startle them with thunder. In the end, it has no tail; in the beginning, no head. One dies, one lives; one collapses, one rises. Its constancy is inexhaustible, yet its unity cannot be awaited. Thus, you were afraid.

You were nearly right—when you heard my music, these three transformations were fitting. *Performed* (奏) means to initiate; *harmonized* (徽) is like the markers on a zither. *Conducted* (行) means to establish and set in motion. *Human affairs* refer to worldly matters; *Heaven* to the principles of Heaven. *Ritual and righteousness* mean the music follows order. *Great Purity* means it aligns with the workings of creation. The initial sounds were thus balanced and just.

From 'the four seasons arise in succession' onward, it speaks of the music’s workings—its transformations startling and wondrous, now playing, now ceasing, yet without revealing its ultimate destination. Generation is civil, decline is martial—they follow their sequence. The four seasons’ growth and decay, the myriad things’ orderly flourishing, their eventual decline—like the music’s civil and martial rhythms. The zither’s civil and martial strings are of this kind, hence 'civil and martial follow their order.' *Flowing light* means the sound flows luminously. Tuning the music’s yin and yang, its clear and muddy tones, it flows thus radiantly, like hibernating creatures roused by thunder.

One cannot see its beginning when approaching, nor its end when following—thus 'in the end, no tail; in the beginning, no head.' Head and tail are but beginning and end. Death and life, collapse and rise—its constancy is inexhaustible, yet its transformations are ceaseless. Seeking its unifying ground, one finds it unattainable—hence 'its unity cannot be awaited.' This is why you were afraid at first.

Then I performed it with the harmony of yin and yang, illuminated it with the brightness of sun and moon. Its sounds could be short or long, soft or hard, transforming uniformly without clinging to old forms. It filled valleys, filled ravines, blocked the senses to guard the spirit, taking things as its measure. Its sounds soared freely, its name lofty and bright—thus ghosts and spirits guarded their depths, while the sun, moon, and stars followed their courses. I halted it at the finite, flowed it into the infinite. You wished to ponder it but could not know it, to gaze upon it but could not see it, to pursue it but could not reach it. Suddenly standing on the path of the fourfold void, leaning against a withered catalpa and chanting, your eyes exhausted in seeking what they desired to see, your strength spent in chasing what you wished to pursue. I had already surpassed you, my form filled with emptiness until it became supple and yielding—thus you grew weary.

The harmony of yin and yang, the light of sun and moon—these too signify harmony and radiance. Long and short, hard and soft—all are transformations, indistinguishable, hence 'transforming uniformly without clinging to old forms.' *Uniform* (齐一) means the same; *old* (故) means former. *Without clinging to old forms* means ever renewing. Filling ravines and valleys means pervading all between Heaven and Earth. *Blocking the senses* (涂却) means sealing one’s clarity—*blocking* (却) is akin to *crevice* (隙), referring to the seven apertures."

Dismiss your cleverness and guard it with spirit, following the myriad things as their measure—this means my music arises not from cunning but from following nature. Its sound unfurls with spacious ease, naturally bearing the name of loftiness. Ghosts and spirits guard their depths, so that no specters haunt nor souls grow weary. Sun, moon, and stars move in their courses, their comings and goings natural. As if halting yet not halting, it is said: "Halting at the finite, flowing without cease." Desires and thoughts know nothing; desires and longings see nothing; desires and pursuits reach nothing—all describe how it seems to have form yet has no form. The four voids are the Great Void.

At such a time, I stand amid the Great Void, leaning on my armrest and chanting. Though I long to see, it cannot be exhausted; though I long to pursue, it cannot be reached. My form, though full, forgets itself, as if empty—thus yielding and at ease. How much more so for you? It is precisely this ease that makes you weary.

*Tangran* describes a state without intent. I then play with tireless sound, tuning it to the command of nature. Thus, it mingles and chases in profusion, like music in the forest yet without form, spreading and waving without drag, dark and dim yet without sound. Moving without direction, dwelling in the profound and obscure—some call it death, some call it life; some call it substance, some call it glory. Flowing, scattering, shifting, it does not adhere to fixed sounds. The world doubts it, so they consult the sage. The sage is one who penetrates reality and fulfills destiny. The celestial mechanism does not unfold, yet the five senses are all complete—this is called celestial music. Without words, the heart rejoices. Thus, the Lord of Yan sang its praise: *"Hearing it, you do not hear its sound; seeing it, you do not see its form. It fills Heaven and Earth, enveloping the six directions."* You wish to hear it yet find no point of contact—hence your confusion.

*Tireless* means unceasing. *The command of nature* is the principle of nature. *"Mingling and chasing in profusion"* describes how the myriad things grow thickly, chasing one another in undifferentiated unity. *Music in the forest* means music so abundant it fills the forest, yet no form is seen. It spreads and waves without force to pull or drag, dark and dim without sound. Changing and moving without fixed direction, its dwelling is in the profound and obscure, beyond exhaustion or fathoming. Neither life nor death, neither glory nor substance. Flowing, scattering, shifting—it does not abide in fixed sounds, that is, it does not cling to old forms. The world, perplexed by this, questions the sage. *Consult* means to inquire. *Penetrating reality* means grasping the true principle. *Fulfilling destiny* means attaining the natural. The five senses are all complete, yet the celestial mechanism does not stir—eyes, ears, hands, and feet are present, yet seeing, hearing, and movement are not self-aware. This is attaining the joy of nature, hence "celestial music." As the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: *"Returning the flow to perfect unity, the six senses do not function"*—this is the meaning of the celestial mechanism not unfolding while the five senses are complete. *Without words, the heart rejoices* means its joy transcends speech. Though you wish to hear it, there is nothing to grasp—hence your confusion.

At this point, another verse is composed, showcasing the artistry of literary elaboration. *"Filling Heaven and Earth, enveloping the six directions"* is the same as *"pervading all between Heaven and Earth."* These four lines carry no separate meaning; their rhythmic turn creates cadence—this is the method of composition.

As for music: at first, there is fear; fear gives rise to haunting. Next comes rest; rest gives rise to escape. Finally, there is confusion; confusion gives rise to foolishness, and foolishness gives rise to the Way. The Way can be borne and journeyed with. Earlier, fear, weariness, and confusion seemed without purpose, but in the conclusion, foolishness leads to entering the Way—this turn is especially artful. For those who seek the Way must pass through such states before making progress.

*Haunting* means eerie clarity. *Weary and escaping* describes the moment of being unable to stop. *Confused and foolish* describes when consciousness vanishes and the six senses cease. These three stages resemble the Chan school’s approach to discussing music. Though divided into three parts, there is no great distinction—merely rhetorical flourish.

When Confucius traveled west to Wei, Yan Yuan asked Shi Jin: *"What of the Master’s conduct?"* Shi Jin replied: *"Alas! Your Master is doomed to hardship."* Yan Yuan asked: *"Why?"* Shi Jin said: *"Before the straw dogs are presented, they are adorned with baskets and mats, wrapped in embroidered cloth, and the invocator fasts to prepare them. Once presented, passersby trample their heads and spines, and gatherers take them to burn. If one were to gather them again, adorn them with baskets and mats, wrap them in embroidered cloth, and wander or rest beneath them, they would not dream—yet surely they would blink in irritation. Now your Master has taken the straw dogs of the former kings, already presented, and wanders with his disciples, resting in their shadow. Thus, he was assaulted while felling a tree in Song, had his borders pared in Wei, and was impoverished in Shang and Zhou—was this not his dream? Besieged between Chen and Cai, seven days without fire or food, death and life as neighbors—was this not his irritation?"*

This passage critiques our sage. Even in Confucius’ time, there were figures like the Old Man with the Staff, Jie Yu of Chu, and the recluses Chang Ju and Jie Ni—all of this kind. *Straw dogs* are dogs made of grass for exorcism, used in sacrifices and then discarded. *Basket* refers to a container; *mat* to a bamboo tray. *Gatherers* collect grass. *Blinking* means dust in the eyes—implying that the learning of the Confucians consists of ancient, outdated words, useless in the present age.

Just as traveling on water is best done by boat, and traveling on land is best done by cart, so too is it with all things. To take a boat’s fitness for water and seek to push it on land is to spend a lifetime going nowhere. How could the difference between past and present be any less than that between water and land? How could the difference between Zhou and Lu be any less than that between boat and cart? Now to insist on practicing Zhou’s ways in Lu is like pushing a boat on land—laborious and fruitless, bringing only misfortune upon oneself. They do not understand the transmission of the boundless Way, which responds to things without exhaustion.

The analogy of rivers and land, boats and carts, speaks to the difference of times. The "transmission of the boundless Way" means not clinging to a single path. Since ancient times, the transmitted Way has always been one that adapts to the times without fixation, thus responding to the world without exhaustion.

Have you alone not seen the well-sweep? Pulled, it descends; released, it rises. What moves it is not the pull of man, yet it bows and lifts without offending anyone. Bowing and lifting, it follows others without attachment—this is the analogy of responding to things without fixed method.

Thus, the rites, righteousness, laws, and measures of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors were not prized for their uniformity but for their efficacy in governance. The rites, righteousness, laws, and measures of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors may be likened to hawthorns, pears, oranges, and pomelos—their flavors differ, yet all are pleasing to the mouth. Thus, rites, righteousness, laws, and measures are things that change with the times.

Hawthorns, pears, oranges, and pomelos are all prized by people, though their flavors differ—this illustrates the idea that the Three Kings had different rites and the Five Emperors had different music. The hawthorn is a type of fruit, resembling a pear but sour.

Now take a gibbon and dress it in the robes of the Duke of Zhou, and it will surely gnaw and tear at them, casting them off entirely before it is satisfied. To observe the difference between past and present is like seeing the difference between a gibbon and the Duke of Zhou. To force the rites and music of the ancients upon people today is like forcing a gibbon to wear human clothes. It is not merely "human clothes" but "the robes of the Duke of Zhou"—the phrasing is meant to mock the sages, hence the pointed wording. The Duke of Zhou established rites, including the system of caps, crowns, robes, and garments, hence "the robes of the Duke of Zhou."

When Xi Shi suffered from heartache, she knit her brows in her village, and the ugly women of her village, seeing this, thought it beautiful. Returning home, they too clutched their chests and knit their brows. The rich of the village, seeing this, firmly shut their doors and refused to come out, while the poor, seeing it, took their wives and children and fled. They knew the beauty of the knitted brow but did not know why it was beautiful. Alas, how your Master will come to ruin!

"Knit her brows" means to furrow the forehead. For people of today to imitate the ancients is like the village women imitating Xi Shi’s knitted brow. The beauty of the knitted brow can only be spoken of in the presence of Xi Shi herself. The way to practice can only be seen in the presence of the ancients. "Your Master" refers to your Master.

This passage contains six analogies, each one excellent—nothing is more difficult in writing than analogy. Wang Quxuan once said: "All my life, I have wanted to create an analogy of my own, but whenever I think of one, it turns out to be something the ancients have already used." In the *Zhuangzi*, every analogy is extraordinary.

Confucius, at the age of fifty-one, had still not heard the Way, so he went south to Pei to see Lao Dan. Lao Dan said: "Have you come? I have heard of you, a worthy man of the north. Have you attained the Way?" Confucius said: "Not yet." Laozi said: "How have you sought it?" Confucius said: "I sought it in measures and numbers, but after five years I had not attained it." Laozi said: "How else have you sought it?" Confucius said: "I sought it in yin and yang, but after twelve years I had not attained it."

Laozi said: "Indeed, if the Way could be offered, no one would fail to offer it to their lord. If the Way could be presented, no one would fail to present it to their parents. If the Way could be told to others, no one would fail to tell it to their brothers. If the Way could be given to others, no one would fail to give it to their children and grandchildren."

"Measures and numbers" refers to rites and music. "Yin and yang" refers to the principles of the myriad things. "Five years" and "twelve years" have no inherent meaning—they simply indicate a long and fruitless search.

The four lines beginning with "If the Way could be offered" are brilliantly put, for they express precisely that the Way cannot be transmitted. Yet the reason it cannot be is no other: without an inner master, it does not abide; without an outer standard, it does not proceed. What issues from within is not received from without—thus the sage does not expound. What enters from without finds no master within—thus the sage does not conceal.

"Without an inner master, it does not abide" means it is not self-seen or self-realized. It speaks of those who study the Way: though they may hear something from without, if they have no inner master of their own, it is not something they have attained for themselves. Though they may wish to retain it, it does not stay. "Without an outer standard" means having nothing against which to verify it—what today’s Chan Buddhists call "confirmation." If I have attained something myself and verify it with a person of the Way, receiving their confirmation, then I may proceed on my own. But if I have no attainment of my own, how can I seek confirmation from others? Though these two lines distinguish inner and outer, in truth they both emphasize self-attainment.

"What issues from within is not received from without" refers to those who teach others. Though my words issue from within, if you cannot receive them, then even when I speak to Yan Hui all day without contradiction, it is because he can receive them. If you cannot receive them, then the sage will not tell you—thus "the sage does not expound." "What enters from without finds no master within" refers to those who receive teaching. Though my words enter your ears from without, if you have no insight and no inner master, then even if you hear the words, you gain nothing—just as the Chan Buddhists say, "What enters by the gate is not the family treasure." Since you have no attainment, you merely assume the sage is concealing something, but the sage is not concealing anything.

"Some of you think I am concealing something from you—do I have anything concealed from you?" This is the meaning.

These four lines are most subtle and profound—you must examine them carefully. The Dao cannot be transmitted, and there is no other reason for this: the flaw lies entirely in these four lines.

Thus it is first said: "that which is so yet cannot be [transmitted]—there is no other reason." A name is a public vessel; one cannot take too much of it. Benevolence and righteousness are the traveller’s hut of the former kings—one may lodge there for a single night but cannot dwell there long, for to be seen and held to account brings many demands.

The utmost persons of antiquity borrowed the Way from benevolence and lodged in righteousness, roaming the wilds of carefree wandering, feeding in fields of simplicity, standing in gardens of no loss—thus they wandered carefree and acted without contrivance. Simplicity is easy to nourish; no loss means no expenditure. The ancients called this "the wandering of gathering the real."

That one cannot take too much of a public name is a rebuke to the Confucians’ love of fame. A traveller’s hut is a thatched cottage—benevolence and righteousness cannot be dwelt in long, for what has traces cannot endure. To be seen (*gòu*) means to be visible. As soon as there are traces and appearances to be seen, calamity and trouble arise from them—thus it is said, "to be seen and held to account brings many demands." To borrow the Way and lodge temporarily is not to dwell long; to go beyond is to transform.

Simplicity (*gǒujiǎn*) means provisional and unadorned—acting in accord with the times without clinging to forms. "No loss" (*bù dài*) is like the modern saying "not taking a loss." Easy to nourish means easy to satisfy; no expenditure means no effort is wasted, nothing is lost to me. "Gathering the real" means gathering the principle of reality.

Those who take wealth as right cannot yield emolument; those who take prominence as right cannot yield fame.

Those who cling to power cannot share authority with others. Grasping it, they tremble; relinquishing it, they grieve—yet they have no mirror to perceive what ceaselessly eludes them. These are the people Heaven condemns. This is the meaning of the greedy man who dies for wealth, the resolute man who dies for fame, and the boastful man who dies for power. Grasping it, they fear loss and tremble; relinquishing it, they cling in confusion and grieve. All three are the same. "No mirror" means they see nothing at all. *Kuī* means to observe; "what ceaselessly eludes them" means they are lost and cannot return. With no clarity in their hearts, they cannot turn back to see their own delusion—these are the people from whom Heaven has stripped their spirit. "Heaven’s condemned people" means Heaven punishes them with this suffering.

Grievance and gratitude, taking and giving, admonition and instruction, life and death—these eight are the instruments of rectification. Only those who follow great change without obstruction can wield them. Thus it is said: "Rectification is rectification." If one’s heart deems this untrue, the Gate of Heaven will not open. Between ruler and minister, it is called *admonition*; between teacher and friend, it is called *instruction*. Where there are human relationships, these eight are put to use. *Instrument* means function. To use what ought to be used is called *rectification*; only those without attachment can wield them. "Following great change" means aligning with the transformations of creation. "Without obstruction" means without being drowned. If I can follow creation without being drowned, then what is within me is rectified, and only then can I rectify others. If I cannot be without attachment and deem the principle of spontaneity untrue, then the Heaven within my breast is already darkened and blocked. Thus it is said, "the Gate of Heaven does not open." The *Book of Songs* says, "Heaven guides the people," which is the meaning of the Gate of Heaven.

When Confucius visited Lao Dan and spoke of benevolence and righteousness, Lao Dan said: "When chaff gets in the eye, the four directions of heaven and earth seem to shift; when mosquitoes and gnats bite the skin, one cannot sleep all night. Benevolence and righteousness are so bitter—they agitate my heart, and no disorder is greater. Sir, if you could make the world not lose its uncarved simplicity, you too would move with the wind and act, holding fast to virtue and standing firm. Why then do you strut about as if shouldering a great drum, seeking a lost child?" *Biting the skin* and *chaff in the eye* are metaphors for things that go against the heart. *Xī* means night, as in the *Zuozhuan*: "At home, one prepares a night’s defense." *Cǎnrán* describes bitterness—it means self-inflicted suffering. "Agitating my heart" means going against my heart. "No disorder is greater" means it disorders one’s nature. "Moving with the wind" means following transformation; acting in accord with transformation is called "moving with the wind." *Zǒng* means to grasp. If the world did not lose its original simplicity, all would act in accord with transformation, grasp virtue, and stand firm—what need would there be for instruction? King Wen set up a drum at his gate to summon the people and teach them, like one shouldering a great drum to seek a lost child. *Jiéran* describes a self-aggrandizing appearance.

The egret is not white from daily bathing, nor is the crow black from daily dyeing. The simplicity of black and white is not worth debating. The spectacle of fame and reputation is not worth expanding. When a spring dries up, fish find themselves on dry land, where they moisten each other with breath and wet each other with foam—yet this is not as good as forgetting one another in rivers and lakes. The whiteness of the egret and the blackness of the crow are naturally so, requiring no bathing or dyeing—these two metaphors are most apt. *Qiān* means to dye black. "The simplicity of black and white" means black and white both have their natural qualities, neither beautiful nor ugly, not worth debating. To display fame and reputation to the world is to introduce the idea of right and wrong; where there is praise, there is blame, and this heart is no longer vast. Black and white are metaphors for right and wrong. How much can fish moisten each other with breath and foam? If they dwelt in rivers and lakes, they would forget one another in the water. In an age of the perfect Dao, each follows spontaneity, without right or wrong, and superiors and inferiors likewise forget one another.

After Confucius visited Lao Dan and returned, he did not speak for three days. His disciples asked: "Master, when you saw Lao Dan, what admonition did you offer?" Confucius said: "Only now have I seen the dragon. The dragon coalesces into form and scatters into pattern, riding the clouds and qi, nourishing itself in yin and yang. My mouth gaped and could not close—what admonition could I offer Lao Dan?" *Guī* means to admonish. "Coalescing into form" means being whole and undifferentiated. "Scattering into pattern" means being distinct and ordered. The dragon in heaven and earth is visible yet not visible, hence the metaphor of scattering and coalescing. "Riding the clouds and qi" means being above the transformations of creation. "Nourishing itself in yin and yang" means delighting in the Dao of heaven and earth. *Xié* means to close. Gaping and unable to close, there was no place for words.

Zigong said: "Then are there indeed people who dwell like corpses yet manifest like dragons, thunderous in voice yet deep in silence, moving like heaven and earth? Could I too observe such a one?" Thereupon he went to see Lao Dan on Confucius’ behalf. Lao Dan was just then sitting arrogantly in the hall when he responded in a low voice: "My years have advanced and departed—what would you warn me about?" Zigong said: "The governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors differed, yet all were linked to fame. Why alone do you deem them untrue? How should the sage act?" Lao Dan said: "Young man, come closer. Why do you say they differed?" Zigong replied: "Yao passed the throne to Shun, Shun to Yu, Yu relied on strength, and Tang on arms; King Wen submitted to Zhou and dared not oppose, while King Wu opposed Zhou and would not submit. Thus I say they differed." Lao Dan said: "Young man, come closer. Let me tell you of the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. The governance of the Yellow Emperor made the people’s hearts not partial—though they had no particular affection, and though the dead were not mourned, the people did not deem it wrong..."

Shun’s governance of the realm made the people’s hearts competitive. Women bore children at ten months, and the infants could speak at five months, asking, “Who is this?” before they could even toddle—thus did people begin to die young. Yu’s governance made the people’s hearts change: each had their own desires, and warfare became a matter of course. Killing bandits was not considered murder; all acted for their own kind, and that was all there was to the world. Thus the realm was greatly alarmed, and the schools of Ru and Mo arose. Their beginnings had order, yet now—what can women say of it?

Confucius’s reputation reached Lao Dan, who remarked on the Master’s disciples and their refined inquiries. Yet when seated in the hall, he reclined with an air of arrogance. His responses were so faint as to be barely audible.

The governance of the Yellow Emperor accorded with nature. The following passages echo this idea, as seen repeatedly in earlier sections. Here, several additional lines appear, rather extraordinary.

Mourning garments were graded by the closeness of kinship, hence it is said, “For their kin they killed their killing.” This refers to the ancient absence of mourning rites, whereas now ritual is established. In ancient times, children were born at fourteen months and did not speak until two years old. To be born at ten months and speak at five is to be precocious. *Shui* means “to ask.” Before reaching the age of toddling, they could already ask, “Who is this?” *Shi* means “early.” *Shui* here means “to identify.” “Made the people’s hearts change” means they changed from ancient ways. “Each had their own desires” means each person had their own private inclinations. “Warfare became a matter of course” means that the use of arms was considered natural. Those who were bandits could be killed without it being deemed a crime or violation of law. At that time, people all divided themselves by kind, each loving their own kin, each cherishing their own children. They merely shared the world together, hence it is said, “and that was all there was to the world.” “Their beginnings had order” means that when such actions first arose, the principles of human relations still existed. Yet their corruption led to the violation of those relations, and when women became wives, what more could be said? That is, there was no room for discussion.

The passage in the *Record of Rites* on “the Great Way being public” conveys a similar idea, though Zhuangzi’s account is far more extreme.

“Let me tell you of the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. Though called governance, none brought greater disorder. The wisdom of the Three Sovereigns obscured the brightness of sun and moon above, disrupted the essence of mountains and rivers below, and threw into chaos the operations of the four seasons in between. Their cunning was more venomous than the sting of wasps or scorpions, more predatory than the hunting of small beasts. None could preserve the natural state of their lives, yet they still called themselves sages. Is it not shameful that they had no shame?”

Zigong stood uneasily, shifting from foot to foot.

The wisdom of the Three Sovereigns also defied the principles of Heaven and Earth’s creation. Earlier passages often exalted the Three Sovereigns while disparaging the Five Emperors, but here even the Three Sovereigns are condemned. *Yichai* refers to wasps and the like, whose tails bear venom. *Xian* means “few.” *Gui* means “to seek.” Small beasts seek little—foxes and the like—yet their cunning is as poisonous as this. Even small creatures are mocked and belittled. *Can* means “venomous.” *Cujuan* describes an uneasy, restless demeanor.

Confucius said to Lao Dan: “I have studied the Six Classics—*Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, *Music*, *Changes*, and *Spring and Autumn*—for a long time, and I believe I understand their essence. Yet in advising seventy-two rulers, expounding the Way of the former kings and clarifying the borders of Zhou and Shao, not one ruler took up my counsel. How difficult it is to persuade people, and how hard to make the Dao clear!”

Laozi said: “Fortunate indeed that you have not encountered a ruler of a well-ordered age. The Six Classics are but the worn-out traces of the former kings—how could they be the true borders? What you speak of are merely traces. Traces are what shoes produce, but are traces the shoes themselves?”

The *Record of Rites* also records Laozi addressing sages by name, likely during Confucius’s inquiry about rites when he took him as his teacher. “Understood their essence” means he grasped their origins and precedents. “Fortunate not to have encountered” implies that had he met an ancient sage, he would have been ridiculed. Where there are shoes, there are footprints. One may follow the traces but not obtain the shoes themselves—this is like the metaphor of dregs and糟粕.

When white egrets gaze at one another, their pupils do not move, yet they conceive through the wind. When male insects chirp on the windward side, females respond on the leeward, and they conceive through the wind. Each kind produces its own male and female, hence they conceive through the wind. Nature cannot be altered, fate cannot be changed, time cannot be halted, and the Dao cannot be blocked. If one attains the Dao, there is nothing that cannot be done, and nothing that can be lost.

Three months later, Confucius returned and said: “I have grasped it! Crows and magpies rear their young, fish spawn in foam, the slender-waisted transform, and the elder brother weeps for his younger brother—how long has this been so? I, Qiu, do not transform with others into a person; if I do not transform with others into a person, how can I transform others?”

Laozi said: “Good. You have grasped it.”

This passage is among the most extraordinary. Male and female egrets do not mate but conceive merely by gazing at one another. All things are born of the wind. The character for “wind” (*feng*) contains the radical for “insect” (*chong*), implying the power to generate life, hence “wind-transformation” refers to reproduction. When insects chirp on the windward side and respond on the leeward, it signifies their positions above and below. The Yellow Emperor followed the leeward path, which aligns with this. Here, the word “wind” differs from “wind-transformation.” “Each kind produces its own male and female” means that within all things, male and female exist as distinct categories, and thus they conceive through wind. The ichneumon wasp transforms the grub of the *gualei* through incantation, but this is a different kind of transformation—here, conception occurs through mutual gaze. Nature, fate, time, and the Dao all refer to the unalterable principles of spontaneity.

Crows and magpies rear their young; fish spawn in foam; the slender-waisted transform; and the elder brother weeps for his younger brother—how long has this been so?

The slender-waisted is the bee. *Hua* (化) refers to spontaneous generation. When a younger brother is born and the elder brother weeps, it is because siblings of the same mother must first wean from the breast before the next is born—thus, the elder is deprived of milk upon the arrival of the younger, hence the elder’s weeping. This phrase is particularly extraordinary; such passages abound in Buddhist scriptures, for they encompass the finest subtleties of literary art—these must not be overlooked.

Those who "do not unite with transformation to become human" speak of knowing humanity but not Heaven, unable to merge with the creative workings of nature. This chapter expounds the principle of ceaseless generation through transformation, illustrating the Dao of spontaneity. It suggests that what Confucians study consists of *wei*-action rather than *wuwei*-nonaction; only *wuwei*-nonaction achieves the same efficacy as the workings of nature.

The Buddhist categories of birth—womb-born, egg-born, transformation-born, and moisture-born—likely derive from this, though their intent differs: they seek to show that this body arises from nothingness to existence, just as all things do, thereby breaking the worldly attachments of self-cherishing and self-adoration.

The *Oral Exegesis of the Southern Florescence Scripture*, Volume Sixteen, concludes here.

---
*The supreme joy first responds to human affairs, accords with the principles of Heaven, enacts the Five Virtues, and aligns with spontaneity; only then does it harmonize the four seasons and bring perfect harmony to the myriad things.*

The *Oral Exegesis of the Southern Florescence Scripture*, Volume Seventeen, by Lin Xiang of Yongzhai.

**Outer Chapters: Carving Intentions**

Those who carve intentions and esteem conduct, distancing themselves from the world and differing from common customs, indulging in lofty discourse and resentful slander—this is but arrogance. Such are the mountain-valley scholars, those who reject the world, those who delight in withering solitude and plunging into the abyss.

Those who speak of benevolence and righteousness, loyalty and trust, reverence and frugality, deference and yielding—this is but cultivation. Such are the scholars of an orderly age, the teachers of the world, those who delight in travel, residence, and learning.

Those who speak of great achievements, establishing great renown, honoring the rites between ruler and minister, rectifying superior and inferior—this is but governance. Such are the scholars of the court, those who exalt the sovereign and strengthen the state, those who delight in achieving merit and annexing lands.

Those who dwell in marshes and wilds, abide in seclusion and vastness, fish and idle—this is but nonaction. Such are the scholars of rivers and seas, those who flee the world, those who delight in leisure and repose.

Those who practice breath control, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, imitating the bear’s climbing and the bird’s stretching—this is but longevity. Such are the practitioners of Daoist arts, those who nurture the body, those who delight in the long-lived like Pengzu.

Yet there are those who, without carving intentions, attain loftiness; without benevolence and righteousness, achieve cultivation; without merit and fame, bring order; without rivers and seas, find repose; without Daoist arts, attain longevity. They forget nothing, yet lack nothing. Serene and boundless, all virtues follow them—this is the Dao of Heaven and Earth, the virtue of the sage.

*Carving* means sculpting, laboring with intent to esteem conduct. *Arrogance* is loftiness. *Resentful slander* is indignation at worldly corruption. *Rejecting the world* is debating the right and wrong of worldly affairs. *Withering solitude* is desolation. *Plunging into the abyss* is seeking profound stillness—like those who fear the forest is not secluded enough or the mountains not deep enough.

*Cultivation* is delighting in refinement. *Teachers of the world* are those who instruct others. *Achieving merit and annexing lands* reflects the realities Zhuangzi observed in his time.

*Fleeing the world in leisure* describes recluses, those who escape society and transcend right and wrong, differing from the arrogant and world-rejecting.

*Imitating the bear’s climbing and the bird’s stretching* refers to Hua Tuo’s *Five Animal Exercises*.

*Forgetting nothing, lacking nothing* is the same as *nonaction yet nothing left undone*. *Boundless* means without fixed limits. *All virtues follow* means possessing all goodness. The sage embodies the natural Dao of Heaven and Earth, hence this state.

Thus it is said: "Serenity, stillness, emptiness, nonbeing, and nonaction—this is the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth and the essence of the Dao and virtue." Therefore, the sage, resting in ease, is level and yielding; being level and yielding, he is serene and still. Serene and still, worries and troubles cannot enter, and perverse qi cannot assail. Thus his virtue is whole, and his spirit is unharmed.

This entire passage, from here onward, strings together many "thus it is said" phrases, culminating in a parable and concluding with a rustic saying—observe closely the ebb and flow of his brushwork.

The *essence* of the Dao and virtue is their natural state. *Level and yielding, serene and still*—this is the meaning of nonaction. *Spirit unharmed* is the same as *virtue whole*. These three characters heighten the vitality.

Thus it is said: "The sage’s life is the movement of Heaven; his death is the transformation of things. At rest, he shares the virtue of yin; in motion, he flows with the waves of yang. He does not precede fortune nor initiate misfortune. He responds only after being moved, acts only when compelled, rises only when unavoidable. Abandoning cunning and contrivance, he follows the principles of Heaven. Thus he suffers no heavenly disasters, no burdens from things, no human reproach, no ghostly blame. His life is like floating; his death is like repose. He neither schemes nor plans. Radiant yet not dazzling, trustworthy yet not demanding. In sleep, he does not dream; awake, he has no worries. His spirit is pure; his soul is not weary."

*Movement of Heaven* means acting in accord with Heaven’s principles. *Transformation of things* means viewing the body like a cast-off husk. *Flowing with the waves* means moving with the current. Responding only after being moved means having no preconceptions, thus transcending fortune and misfortune. *Acting only when compelled, rising only when unavoidable*—this is the meaning of responding to things without intent.

*Cunning* is private cleverness. *Contrivance* is adherence to past methods. Abandoning private cleverness and departing from past methods, one follows nature.

*Like floating, like repose*—this is the meaning of being unattached. *Neither scheming nor planning*—this is the same as "what thought, what worry?" *Radiant yet not dazzling*—this is self-effacement. *Trustworthy yet not demanding*—this is not seeking anything from things.

His spirit is whole, hence pure; his soul is still, hence not weary. *Weary* is the same as *fatigued*.

Thus it is said: "Sorrow and joy are perversions of virtue; delight and anger are transgressions of the Dao; likes and dislikes are lapses of virtue." Therefore, a heart free from sorrow and joy is the perfection of virtue; unchanging unity is the perfection of stillness; encountering nothing contrary is the perfection of emptiness; not engaging with things is the perfection of serenity; meeting nothing adverse is the perfection of purity.

If there is sorrow and joy, delight and anger, likes and dislikes, it is not natural. Only when worries and joys do not bind the heart is virtue perfected. *Unchanging unity* means focusing on one without distraction. *Encountering nothing contrary* means following nature. *Contrary* means opposition. *Not engaging with things* means responding only after being moved—though interacting with things, one is not burdened by them.

*Stillness, emptiness, serenity, purity*—these all describe the virtue of spontaneity, thus elaborated.

*Contrary* and *adverse* are similar, but *adverse* is deeper, hence two separate phrases. *Purity* means without flaw.

Thus it is said: "When the body labors without rest, it becomes worn; when essence is used without cease, it becomes exhausted; exhaustion leads to depletion. Water, by nature, is clear when unadulterated, level when undisturbed. If obstructed and not flowing, it cannot remain clear—this is the image of Heaven’s virtue."

Thus it is said: "Pure and unadulterated, still and unchanging, serene and nonactive, moving in accord with Heaven’s movement—this is the Dao of nurturing the spirit."

The body’s labor leads to wear, the use of essence leads to exhaustion—these are the earnest words of those who cultivate life, echoing the earlier passage: *"Only by not agitating one’s essence can one attain longevity."* Labor, if unceasing, must lead to depletion, hence it is said: *"Exhaustion leads to depletion."* The water analogy, though seemingly commonplace, reveals a deeper truth: *"If obstructed and not flowing, it cannot remain clear."* This is not the same as withered wood or dead ashes.

*"Unadulterated, it is clear; undisturbed, it is level"*—this is nonaction. *"Not flowing, it cannot remain clear"*—within nonaction, there is action. As Xiangyan said: *"One cannot merely sit idly."* To be obstructed and not flowing is what Chan Buddhists call *"sitting in a ghost’s den"*—the so-called *"silent illumination"* heresy.

Heaven’s movement completes a cycle each day—is this not action within nonaction? Thus it is called *"the image of Heaven’s virtue."*

Nurturing the spirit is nurturing life. To invoke the word *"spirit"* is to make it intimate—this is the learning of the Daoists. The Buddhists, however, refuse to speak of such a *"spirit."* When they say *"from beginningless time"* or call the *"root of birth and death"* the *"original self,"* they are merely evading this term.

A sword of Gan and Yue is treasured in a case and never used—this is the height of reverence. The spirit flows in all four directions, reaching everywhere, ascending to Heaven, coiling upon the earth, transforming and nourishing the myriad things, yet leaving no trace—it is called the *"Dao of unified simplicity with the Emperor."* Only the spirit is to be guarded; guard it without loss, and you become one with the spirit. The unity of essence penetrates and harmonizes with Heaven’s order.

To treasure a sword is to keep it cased and hidden—how much more so the spirit? This is the analogy for *"the use of essence leads to exhaustion."* *"Flowing in all four directions, coiling below and ascending above"* describes the spirit’s function. The transformation and nourishment of the myriad things are also the work of this spirit. Yet no trace is visible, hence it is said: *"no image can be made of it."*

*"Unified with the Emperor"* means its function is equal to that of Heaven’s Emperor. Those who practice *"pure simplicity"* begin by guarding only the spirit, preserving it without loss. Through long practice, they become one with the spirit—this is the time of *"great transformation."* Before transformation, one remains separate from the Dao; after transformation, one is one with the Dao.

*"Heaven’s order"* is Heaven’s principle. Unity, taken to its utmost refinement, merges with Heaven—this is what is called *"sagely and unknowable spirit."*

This chapter aligns closely with my own writings, yet its stirring and dynamic expression veers into heterodoxy. A rustic saying goes: *"The common people value profit, the upright value reputation, the worthy uphold aspiration, the sages treasure essence."* Thus, *"simplicity"* means having nothing mixed in; *"purity"* means not diminishing one’s spirit. One who embodies pure simplicity is called a *"Perfected Person."*

*"Rustic saying"* refers to folk adages, like proverbs. *"The sages treasure essence"*—*"essence"* here is the spirit. The three preceding lines—profit, reputation, aspiration—frame this final line. *"Simplicity"* is undivided color, hence *"nothing is mixed in."* *"Purity"* is whole, hence *"nothing is diminished."* *"Pure simplicity"* is the *"pure and refined essence"* of Qian. The *"Perfected Person"* is the *"Ultimate Person."*

Earlier, it spoke of *"the virtue of the sage,"* and now of the *"Perfected Person"*—just as the *Inner Chapters* say *"the Ultimate Person has no self, the Spirit Person has no name."* These are merely different names for the sage, not that the Perfected Person or Ultimate Person surpass the sage.

The *"Cultivating Intent"* chapter discusses nurturing the spirit with theories of Heaven’s movement and the transformation of things, while the *"Mending Nature"* chapter speaks of preserving the body with doctrines of fate and misguided conduct. Dividing the cultivation of spirit and the preservation of the body into two chapters reveals the distinction in their methods of study. Readers who fail to examine this carefully betray Zhuangzi’s intent across the ages.

The *"Mending Nature"* chapter of the *Outer Chapters* states:
*"Mending nature through vulgar learning to seek a return to one’s origin, drowning desires in worldly thoughts to pursue fame—these are the benighted masses."*

*"Mending nature"* means cultivating one’s nature. *"Mending nature through vulgar learning"* critiques the Confucian and Mohist discourses on human nature of the time. *"Origin"* is the principle of spontaneity—one’s nature. *"Drowning"* means being submerged. *"Drowning desires in the vulgar"* means being submerged in worldly desires. *"Brightness"* is the principle of emptiness and clarity. To cultivate one’s nature through vulgar learning in pursuit of returning to the original principle of reason, or to be drowned in desires while seeking the state of emptiness and clarity—these are the most ignorant, those devoid of knowledge. Such are called the *"benighted masses"*—a term for the foolishness of vulgar learning.

The opening of this passage is most striking, beginning with such force. Only after three sentences does it speak of *"those who cultivated the Dao in ancient times"*—truly fine writing. As Su Dongpo said: *"Reading Zhuangzi, I grasped the method of writing, and only after practicing it did I understand."*

*"Those who cultivated the Dao in ancient times nurtured knowledge with tranquility, living without employing knowledge—this is called nurturing tranquility with knowledge."* Knowledge and tranquility nurture each other, and harmony and principle emerge from one’s nature.

*"Virtue"* is harmony; *"Dao"* is principle. *"Virtue admits all"* is benevolence; *"Dao orders all"* is righteousness. *"Righteousness is clear, and things draw near"* is loyalty. *"Centered, pure, and returning to emotion"* is joy. *"Trust in conduct, receptivity in form, and compliance with pattern"* is ritual. If ritual and music are practiced in isolation, the world falls into chaos.

If one rectifies others while obscuring one’s own virtue, virtue is no longer all-embracing. If virtue is not all-embracing, things lose their nature.

*"Tranquility"* is stillness and stability; stability gives rise to wisdom, hence *"nurturing knowledge with tranquility."* Knowing that in the beginning of one’s existence there was originally nothing—what is there to employ knowledge for? Only then can one attain stillness and stability, hence *"nurturing tranquility with knowledge."* When these two nurture each other, one recovers one’s natural nature.

*"Principle"* means compliance; *"harmony and principle"* is another way of saying *"harmony and compliance."*

Stillness and stability recover one’s original, harmonious, and compliant nature—hence *"harmony and principle emerge from nature."* The term *"nature"* is synonymous with *"natural."* *"Nurturing knowledge with tranquility, nurturing tranquility with knowledge"*—these six characters are most profound. The Buddhists say: *"Precepts give rise to stability; stability gives rise to wisdom."* Yet they do not speak of wisdom giving rise to stability. Such passages merit careful study.

Virtue and the Dao are themselves harmony and compliance—hence *"virtue"* means *"harmony,"* and *"Dao"* means *"principle."* *"Nothing is not embraced"* is *"nothing is not loved,"* and *"nothing is not ordered"* is *"each attains its proper place."* Only when righteousness is luminous within can one be intimate with things—this is exhausting oneself for others, which is called *"loyalty."* Emotion is that which manifests outwardly. When the true purity of the center is expressed externally, and one returns from outward manifestation to seek the center, joy is born—once born, how can it be restrained? Thus, *"inner purity and sincerity returning to emotion"* is *"joy."*

Trusting in the conduct of one’s bearing and following the natural patterns of refinement is to move and turn in accord with ritual in all things. Hence, *"trusting in conduct and bearing, complying with pattern"* is *"ritual."* *"Trust"* means *"to rely upon,"* and *"trusting in conduct"* is like *"acting with ease."* Seeking ritual and music externally while ignorant of their root is called *"practicing in isolation,"* as if seeing only half the matter. *"Obscuring"* means *"concealing."* When virtue accumulates within without self-display, things naturally rectify themselves—hence *"rectifying others while obscuring one’s own virtue."* *"Not all-embracing"* means one does not impose virtue upon others. If virtue is not concealed but sought to be imposed, it loses its naturalness—hence *"if all-embracing is lost, things necessarily lose their nature."* Ruling the world through goodness is not as good as nurturing the world through goodness—this is the meaning here.

In ancient times, people dwelled in primordial obscurity, attaining tranquility and indifference with their age. At that time, yin and yang were harmonious and still, spirits and gods did not disturb, the four seasons kept their rhythm, the myriad things were unharmed, and the multitude of living beings did not die prematurely. Though humans possessed knowledge, there was nothing to employ it for—this was called *"perfect unity."* At that time, nothing was done, yet all was constantly natural.

*"Primordial obscurity"* means *"concealed and not self-displaying."* *"Tranquil and indifferent"* suggests no seeking between above and below. The entire world was pure and complete, lacking nothing in the Dao—hence *"perfect unity."* *"Nothing was done"* means no effort was required. *"Spirits and gods did not disturb"* means mountains, rivers, spirits, and gods were all at peace. *"The four seasons kept their rhythm"* means heaven and earth followed their order, and the four seasons unfolded.

When virtue declined, it reached the era of Suiren and Fuxi, who first ruled the world—thus, compliance was achieved, but not unity. When virtue declined further, it reached the era of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor, who first ruled the world—thus, peace was achieved, but not compliance. When virtue declined yet further, it reached the era of Tang and Yu, who initiated the currents of governance and transformation. Simplicity dissolved, and purity scattered; they departed from the Dao to pursue goodness, flaunted virtue to enact policies, then abandoned nature to follow the heart. Hearts and minds recognized one another, yet knowledge was insufficient to stabilize the world. Only then did they append refinement and augment it with breadth. Refinement destroyed substance, and breadth drowned the heart—thereafter, the people began to be confused and disordered, unable to return to their nature and emotions and recover their origin.

These three declines each exhibit their own peculiarities.

Once one recognizes that principle may be followed, the pure and unified has already departed—hence, "compliance without unity." When each person takes principle as their security, they become aware of the self; aware of the self, they depart from the Dao—hence, "peace without compliance." When one deliberately acts for the world and initiates its teachings and transformations, it is no longer non-action or spontaneity—hence, "simplicity dissolved, and purity scattered." *Li* means dissipation. To possess the name of goodness is already to distance oneself from the Dao; to make virtue visible in action is to render it no longer plain and spontaneous—hence, "departing from the Dao to pursue goodness, flaunting virtue to enact policies." *Xian* means not plain or spontaneous. To abandon one’s natural nature and follow the heart of deliberate action—hence, "abandoning nature to follow the heart." I act with intention, and others respond in kind—hence, "hearts recognizing one another." *Shi* means mutual recognition and discernment. In such cases, the "heart" is always the blazing heart. *Wen* refers to ornamentation; *bo* refers to the multitude of names and things, the completeness of rites, music, and all affairs. When knowledge proves insufficient, and one appends it with rites and music—hence, "knowledge insufficient to stabilize the world, then appending refinement and augmenting it with breadth." *Bo* means profusion lacking essentials. To apply the heart to such things is like drowning. From this perspective, the world has lost the Dao, and the Dao has lost the world—they mutually lose one another. How can the person of the Dao arise in the world? How can the world arise in the Dao? If the Dao cannot arise in the world, and the world cannot arise in the Dao, then even if the sage does not dwell in the mountains and forests, their virtue is concealed. Concealment is not self-concealment. The Dao and the world mutually lose one another, meaning they do not interpenetrate. If they do not interpenetrate, how can the person of the Dao inspire the world’s perceptions? How can the world’s people come to know the Dao? When the entire world does not know the Dao, even if the sage stands before them, they remain unaware. It is not that the sage conceals themselves; others do not recognize them, and thus they are concealed without seeking concealment—hence, "concealment is not self-concealment." The reason for their concealment is not that the sage deliberately hides, but that they stand before others unrecognized. These five characters below are also striking.

The ancients’ so-called "recluses" did not crouch in concealment nor refuse to appear; they did not seal their words nor withhold their knowledge. It was the great perversity of the times. When the times aligned with their destiny and they could fully act in the world, they returned to unity without trace. When the times did not align and they were greatly constrained in the world, they deeply rooted themselves, settled in stillness, and awaited their moment. This is the way of preserving the self. Following the above discussion of "concealment," the text now turns to recluses. Such scholars did not wish to hide their bodies, seal their words, or conceal their knowledge—it was the times that were unfit. *Concealing knowledge* means appearing foolish when the state lacks the Dao. *The times were greatly perverse* means they were profoundly at odds with destiny; *miu* means opposition. *Returning to unity without trace* means achieving success without possession, allowing the Dao to be practiced while entrusting things to non-intention. What lies within me is unity alone—hence, "returning to unity." *Root and extremity* refer to one’s fundamental nature; *ji* means cessation. *Deeply rooting* is like retreating into secrecy; *settling in stillness* is like "calm your cessation." Preserving the self to await the moment—hence, "deeply rooting, settling in stillness, and awaiting"—preserving the self is preserving the self.

The ancients who conducted themselves in the world did not adorn their knowledge with eloquence, did not exhaust the world with their knowledge, nor exhaust virtue with their knowledge. Solemnly abiding in their place and returning to their nature—what more was there to do? The Dao is not to be practiced in petty ways; virtue is not to be known in petty ways. Petty knowledge harms virtue; petty action harms the Dao. Hence, it is said: "Rectify the self and that is all." To delight in wholeness is called "attaining one’s aspirations." Following the discussion of "preserving the self," the text now speaks of "conducting oneself." *Preserving* pertains to times of non-use; *conducting* pertains to times of use. *Not adorning knowledge with eloquence* means not embellishing one’s insights with florid words. *Not exhausting the world with knowledge* means not daring to use one’s surplus. *Not exhausting virtue with knowledge* means using knowledge without losing one’s natural nature. *Solemnly abiding in their place* means standing in loftiness. *Returning to their nature* is the same as "returning to unity without trace." Non-action is the greatness of the Dao; deliberate action is petty conduct, and petty conduct harms the Dao. Unknowing and unperceiving are the greatness of virtue; having knowledge and perception is petty knowledge, and petty knowledge loses virtue. Rectifying the self causes things to rectify themselves—one does not initially seek to rectify things—hence, "rectify the self and that is all." Taking this as joy means that what is joyful is complete; one’s gratification lies here, not in external things. *Attaining one’s aspirations* is like gratification; these two characters generate the following passage.

The ancients’ so-called "attaining one’s aspirations" did not refer to carriages and caps of office—it meant that nothing could augment their joy. Today’s so-called "attaining one’s aspirations" refers to carriages and caps of office. Carriages and caps on the body are not one’s nature or destiny. Their arrival is fortuitous, a lodging. When lodged, their coming cannot be resisted, nor their going halted—thus, one does not indulge their aspirations for carriages and caps, nor conform to custom in poverty and constraint. Their joy is the same in both, hence they are without sorrow. If one is unhappy when the lodging departs, then even in joy there is distraction. Hence, it is said: "Those who lose themselves in things and their nature in custom are called inverted people." One who is sufficient within seeks nothing without—hence, "nothing can augment their joy," for all things are complete within the self. Turning inward in sincerity, joy is unbounded. Nature and destiny are the heavenly nobility; carriages and caps are external things. Their arrival is accidental—hence, "fortuitous." Going and staying lie with them, not with me—hence, "lodging."

These three characters are exquisitely placed. Knowing that their coming and going cannot be certain, the enlightened are neither unrestrained in prosperity nor bent in adversity—hence, "one does not indulge their aspirations for carriages and caps, nor conform to custom in poverty and constraint." To "conform to custom" is to bend the self to follow the times. "That" refers to the Dao. Their joy in the Dao is the same as others' joy in carriages and caps—hence, "their joy is the same in both." If joy resides within the self, there is no moment when sorrow can arise; if joy depends on external things, then when those things depart, joy departs with them. Since their joy has coming and going, it is not true joy—hence, "even in joy there is distraction." "Inverted" means not knowing root from branch. The self and nature are the root; things and custom are the branch. To value the branch and lose the root is called "inverted people." This entire passage is a seamless text—one must carefully observe how it binds the end to the beginning and connects what follows to what precedes.

**Outer Chapters: "Autumn Floods"**

When the autumn floods came, the hundred rivers poured into the Yellow River. The turbid currents swelled so vast that between its two banks and the isles within, one could not distinguish ox from horse. Thereupon the River Lord rejoiced, exulting that all the world’s beauty was his alone. Following the current eastward to the Northern Sea, he turned to face the east and saw no end to the waters. Then the River Lord at last turned his countenance, gazed across the ocean toward Ruo, and sighed:

There is a rustic saying: “Hearing of the Dao a hundred times, one thinks none can compare to oneself.” That describes me. Moreover, I once heard of those who belittled Confucius’s learning and made light of Boyi’s righteousness—I did not believe it at first. Now I have witnessed the boundlessness of your realm. Had I not come to your gate, I would have remained in peril. I would long have been ridiculed by those of great attainment.

*Turbid*: The Yellow River’s waters surge in and churn muddy, filling both banks—hence “the vastness of the turbid flow.” *Two banks*: This is not the Jing of “Jing and Wei.” *Isles and shores*: The isles within the river. The two characters *zhu* and *ya* carry equal weight; if *ya* were glossed as “boundary,” the phrase below would not cohere. *Unable to distinguish ox from horse*: Seen from afar, things are unclear. *No end to the waters*: One cannot know the water’s source. *Ocean*: The expanse of the sea. *Ruo*: The name of a sea deity.

The myriad principles of the world—if one has heard but a hundred, one thinks oneself abundant. The phrase “hearing of the Dao a hundred times” seems an ancient saying, its meaning directed at Confucius and Boyi, hence the analogy of rivers and seas.

*Great attainment*: The great Dao.

The Northern Sea’s Ruo said: “You cannot speak of the sea to a frog in a well—it is confined by its dwelling. You cannot speak of ice to a summer insect—it is bound by its season. You cannot speak of the Dao to a narrow scholar—he is shackled by his teachings. Now that you have emerged from your banks and beheld the great sea, you know your own inadequacy. You may now be spoken to of great principles.

No water in the world is greater than the sea. The ten thousand rivers return to it, yet it never fills, though they flow without cease. The Tail Pool drains it, yet it never empties, though it flows without end. Unchanged through spring and autumn, unmoved by flood or drought—its surpassing of the rivers’ flow cannot be measured. Yet I have never taken pride in this, for I compare my form to heaven and earth and receive qi from yin and yang. I stand between heaven and earth as a pebble or twig stands in a great mountain. Aware of my own smallness, how could I take pride?

*Confined by its dwelling*: Limited to its abode. *Bound by its season*: Knowing only one time, like the cicada unaware of spring and autumn. *Knows its own inadequacy*: Recognizes its own shame. *Tail Pool*: The Scorched Waste, mentioned in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*—where the sea’s waters vanish as soon as they arrive.

Comparing the sea to heaven and earth, one sees only its smallness—how could one know its greatness? As the Chan masters say: “Even the greatest must rise from the earth; beyond the highest, there is still heaven.” This is the meaning here.

Consider the four seas within heaven and earth—are they not like a crevice in a great marsh? Consider the Central States within the seas—are they not like a grain of millet in a granary? The number of things is called ten thousand, yet man occupies but one. The nine provinces teem with people, where grain is grown and boats and carts travel—yet man occupies but one. Compared to the ten thousand things, is he not like the tip of a hair on a horse’s body?

What the Five Emperors inherited, what the Three Kings contended for, what the benevolent lamented, what the capable toiled over—all is encompassed here. Boyi renounced it to gain fame; Confucius discoursed on it to display his erudition. Their self-regard was no different from your former pride in your waters.

*Crevice*: A small hole, like a wasp’s nest. *Teeming people*: The multitude. Man is but one among the ten thousand things—this is reckoned within the vastness of the cosmos, considering all that can be named. Within the nine provinces, he is but one among grasses, trees, birds, and beasts. These two lines are exquisitely phrased. As Le Xuan said: “Though heaven and earth are vast and the human body small, a fist-sized stone in the void makes a splendid journey.” This is the meaning.

The world is so small that the knowledge and abilities of the Five Emperors, Three Kings, and all the sages and worthies do not exceed it. Such words are vast and profound, yet they hold truth. Boyi renounced it for fame; Confucius discoursed on it for breadth—who before has spoken thus?

*Capable scholar*: One who undertakes affairs, meaning those who govern the world.

The River Lord said: “Then may I consider heaven and earth great and the tip of a hair small?”

The Northern Sea’s Ruo said: “No. The measure of things is boundless, time has no end, divisions are not constant, beginnings and endings are not fixed. Thus the great-minded observe near and far: small yet not meager, great yet not excessive. Knowing measure is boundless, they verify the past and present—thus distant yet not weary, grasping yet not straining. Knowing time has no end, they discern fullness and emptiness—thus gaining without joy, losing without sorrow. Knowing divisions are not constant, they understand the level path—thus living without delight, dying without calamity, knowing beginnings and endings cannot be fixed.

What man knows is less than what he does not know; the time of his life is less than the time before his birth. To seek the limits of the greatest with the smallest is to become lost and unable to find one’s way. From this perspective, how can one know the tip of a hair suffices to define the finest boundary? How can one know heaven and earth suffice to exhaust the greatest realm?”

This turn of speech is also fine. Earlier, it spoke of greatness; here, it speaks of no small and no great—just as it is said: “Nothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small.”

The measure of things is boundless—this means things cannot be measured or delimited. Time knows no pause—this means cold and heat, day and night follow one another without end. Divisions are not constant—this means being and non-being, gain and loss, the apportionments of men, may come first or last, with no fixed order. Beginnings and endings know no precedent—this means there is no end and no beginning, no new and no old.

Thus, those of great wisdom—those with profound understanding—are the ones who attain the four insights that follow. Observing the distant as if near, they do not regard size as determining quantity, and so they know measure is without limit. *Zheng xiang* means to examine and clarify. *Jin gu* means past and present. Understanding that past and present are one, they welcome what has not yet arrived without anxiety, though distant, and do not strain to grasp what is easily taken, though near. Only by awaiting it do they know time has no fixed pause. Fullness is gain; emptiness is loss. The waxing and waning of fullness and emptiness move with time, and not taking this as cause for joy or resentment, they know apportionments are not constant. Understanding the level path is to recognize the true Dao. Following the true Dao, they let life and death take their course—this is the meaning of "longevity and early death are not two, cultivate the self and await it." Understanding this, they know endings cannot be treated as precedents for beginnings. This is the teaching of tracing origins and grasping ends.

What man knows is man; what he does not know is heaven. For example, after birth, I know it; before birth, how could I know it? This is like the Chan saying: "the phrase of the Dao before father and mother were born." The smallest is the self; the greatest is heaven. To seek to exhaust heaven’s vastness with the self’s smallness is to become lost and disquieted—these few lines, in Chan terms, would be a great *gong’an*. Zhuangzi, however, speaks of it casually.

What follows, from "those of great wisdom" onward, explains the preceding lines. The phrasing expands and contracts, long and short, even yet uneven—this is the art of prose. *Ni* means tip; *yu* means realm. Speaking of the small, there is no tip; exhausting the great, there is no realm. Thus it is said: how can one define the finest tip? How can one exhaust the greatest realm?

The River Lord said: "Those who discuss the world all say the most refined has no form, the greatest cannot be encompassed—is this true?"

The Lord of the Northern Sea said: "One who views the great from the small cannot see it all; one who views the small from the great cannot see it clearly. The refined is the subtlest of the small; *fu* is the fullness of the great. Thus, differences arise—this is the nature of things. The refined and the coarse are limited to what has form. What has no form cannot be divided by number. What cannot be encompassed cannot be exhausted by number. What can be discussed in words is the coarse aspect of things. What can be grasped by intention is the refined aspect. What words cannot discuss, what intention cannot fathom, does not depend on refinement or coarseness.

This turn of speech is also fine. The most refined has no form—this is the subtle, not merely the smallest. To say "most refined" rather than "smallest" is where the language comes alive. *Xin qing* means: does one truly believe this statement? Viewing the great from the small cannot exhaust it—like peering at the sky through a tube. Viewing the small from the great cannot clarify it—like the roc bird looking down at wild horses and dust. The subtlest of the small is called *jing*—smaller and smaller. The fullest of the great is called *fu*—greater and greater. *Yin* means fullness. *Yi bian* means what is fitting differs. Introducing these two lines in the context of small and great is also exquisite. The formless small cannot be divided by number—whether hair or feather, it cannot be done. The unencompassable great cannot be exhausted by number—whether *ti* or *zhao*, it cannot be done. All things, refined or coarse, are confined to form, so they can be discussed in words and inferred by intention. But if the small and the great have no form, then words cannot discuss them, and intention cannot reach their limits. Since they are formless, one cannot speak of them in terms of refinement or coarseness—thus it is said they do not depend on refinement or coarseness. *Cha zhi* means to examine their utmost.

Therefore, the conduct of the great person does not extend to harming others, nor does it abound in benevolence and kindness. Their actions are not for profit, nor do they despise gatekeepers and servants. They do not contend over wealth, nor do they excessively defer to others. In affairs, they do not rely on others, nor do they overindulge in their own strength. They do not despise the greedy and corrupt, and their conduct differs from the common, though not excessively so. They follow the crowd without despising flatterers. The world’s ranks and emoluments are insufficient to encourage them; disgrace and punishment are insufficient to shame them. They know right and wrong cannot be fixed as divisions, nor can the fine and the great be defined as boundaries.

It is said: the Daoist does not strive, the one of utmost virtue does not attain, the great person has no self—this is the ultimate in moderation. Though they do not harm things, neither do they take loving things as their ability—thus it is said they do not extend to harming others. Not abounding in benevolence and kindness refers to gatekeepers and menial laborers who seek profit. As it is said: "Even if it were holding a whip, I would do it." Though I do not seek profit, neither do I regard those who seek profit through menial labor as wrong—thus it is said their actions are not for profit, and they do not despise gatekeepers. If one harbors the thought of despising menial labor while exalting oneself, one leaves traces. I do not contend over wealth, nor do I take deference as ability—thus it is said they do not contend over wealth, nor do they excessively defer. To take deference as one’s abundance is to approach fame. In all affairs, they act for themselves without relying on others, yet they do not exhaust their strength to feed themselves—thus it is said they do not rely on others in affairs, nor do they overindulge in their own strength. To say "not overindulging in strength" means they do not dare to use it all. They do not despise the greedy and corrupt—you are you, I am I—thus it is said they do not despise the greedy and corrupt.

Their conduct is truly different from others, yet they do not deliberately set themselves apart—thus it is said their actions diverge from the common, yet they do not excessively cultivate eccentricity. *Bi* means "perverse"; *bi yi* means "deliberate eccentricity." To act is to follow the multitude, blending light and merging with dust. They do not despise the fawning and obsequious, dwelling with them in ease, for such men cannot taint their intent. "Not despising" means they do not revile or loathe them. Such people make no distinctions of right and wrong, merging the great and the small—these are the men of the Dao, of utmost virtue, the great ones. "Not hearing" means namelessness. "Not obtaining" means neither gain nor loss. "Restricting one’s portion" means aligning with the utmost principle in its utmost simplicity and fulfilling one’s allotted role. *Wen yue* means "I have heard this saying from antiquity." "Restricting one’s portion" is simply another way of saying "fulfilling oneself."

The River Earl said: Beyond things, within things—where do distinctions of noble and base, great and small reach their limit?
The Lord of the Northern Sea said: Viewed through the Dao, things have no nobility or baseness. Viewed through things themselves, each esteems itself and devalues others. Viewed through custom, nobility and baseness do not reside in oneself. Viewed through gradation, if one magnifies what is great in each, then nothing is not great; if one diminishes what is small in each, then nothing is not small. Knowing heaven and earth to be but a grain of millet, knowing the tip of a hair to be a mountain—then the gradations of difference become clear. Viewed through function, if one affirms what each possesses, then nothing is without possession; if one negates what each lacks, then nothing is without lack. Knowing east and west to be opposites yet indispensable to one another—then the boundaries of function are fixed. Viewed through inclination, if one affirms what each affirms, then nothing is not affirmed; if one negates what each negates, then nothing is not negated. Knowing Yao and Jie each affirmed their own way and negated the other—then the tendencies of conduct become clear.

The earlier passage on not despising gatekeepers or the greedy and corrupt is here extended to include nobility and baseness, great and small. "Beyond and within things" means considering things in their external and internal aspects. *Zhi* means "limit." *Wu zhi* means "where does it reach its limit?" Noble and base, great and small—where does one seek their beginnings and endings? Viewed through things, each esteems itself and devalues others, like the pigweed and the *fuling* herb, which may at times be esteemed as imperial. What is unseen in oneself is known in others—this is like the hundred bones and nine orifices, each alternately serving as ruler and subject. This line is particularly well put. "Nobility and baseness do not reside in oneself" expresses the idea that cap and gown come as temporary lodgings.

*Cha* means gradation. If heaven and earth are but a grain of millet, and the tip of a hair rivals Mount Tai, then the numbers of gradation are not worth mentioning—they are plain to see. *Gong fen* means the boundaries of merit and duty. Each fulfills a role as their merit, hence "boundaries of merit." Farmers, merchants, artisans, and traders each exert their strength according to their portion, and the world cannot do without a single one—just as east and west, though opposites, cannot do without one another. *Qu cao* means the inclinations and integrity of one’s conduct. To take Yao as right and Jie as wrong is the natural tendency of conduct. Yet if one were to abolish the unworthy, how would a lord arise? From this, the instability of conduct’s inclinations is evident. Affirming their greatness or smallness, their possession or lack, their rightness or wrongness—this is the meaning of "equalizing things by following their 'that's it.'"

In ancient times, Yao and Shun abdicated and became emperors; Zhi and Kuai abdicated and perished. Tang and Wu contended and became kings; the Duke of Bai contended and was destroyed. From this, we see that the rites of contention and deference, the conduct of Yao and Jie, nobility and baseness—all have their time and cannot be taken as constant. Comparing Yao and Shun with Zhi and Kuai, Tang and Wu with the Duke of Bai—these are all impassioned arguments of the times. Such passages appear frequently; one must observe the flow of the text.

A roof beam can batter a city wall but cannot plug a rat hole—this speaks of different implements. The *qiji* and *hualiu* can gallop a thousand *li* in a day, but they are no match for a wildcat in catching mice—this speaks of different skills. The owl snatches fleas at night and discerns the tip of a hair, but when it emerges in daylight, it glares and cannot see a mountain—this speaks of different natures. Thus it is said: If one takes "this" as the teacher and rejects "that," or takes order as the teacher and rejects disorder—this is not yet to understand the principles of heaven and earth and the conditions of the myriad things. It is like taking heaven as the teacher and rejecting earth, or taking yin as the teacher and rejecting yang—its impracticability is obvious. Yet to persist in such speech without ceasing is either foolishness or deceit.

The abdications of emperors and kings differ; the successions of the Three Dynasties differ. Those who oppose their times and defy custom are called usurpers. Those who align with their times and follow custom are called men of righteousness. The River Earl, silent, asks: How could you know the gate of nobility and baseness, the house of great and small?

A *liang* is a roof beam. *Li* (read as *li*) is a ridgepole. Great and small each have their uses—hence "different implements." The *qiji* and the wildcat each have their abilities—hence "different skills." The owl, an ominous bird, sees clearly at night but is blinded by daylight—its nature differs. Right and wrong, order and disorder cannot be mutually abolished; these are necessities of the human world, hence the analogies to different implements, skills, and natures. Heaven and earth, yin and yang are likewise analogies for their indispensability. Usurpers and men of righteousness are the same as the discussion of Yao and Jie.

The River Earl said: Then what should I do? What should I not do? How should I decide what to accept or reject, what to pursue or abandon? What is my ultimate course?
The Lord of the Northern Sea said: Viewed through the Dao, what is noble? What is base? This is called "reversion and overflow." Without constraint in one’s intent, one greatly obstructs the Dao. What is little? What is much? This is called "decline and bestowal." Without uniformity in one’s conduct, one deviates from the Dao. Solemn as a state with its ruler, impartial in virtue; flowing as a sacrifice with its officiant, impartial in blessing; boundless as the four directions, without boundaries—embracing the myriad things, who bears them up? This is called "without direction."

All things are equal—what is short? What is long? The Dao has no end or beginning; things have death and life. Do not rely on their completion. Now empty, now full, they do not abide in form. Years cannot be lifted; time cannot be halted. Waning and waxing, fullness and emptiness—an end gives rise to a beginning. This is how one speaks of the great meaning’s direction, how one discusses the principle of the myriad things.

Things come to life as if galloping, as if racing—no movement without change, no moment without shift. What should be done? What should not be done? They will transform of themselves.

This question is well asked. Since there is no noble or base, no right or wrong, then how should I decide what to accept or reject? *Yan* means spacious and unconfined. *Fan* means to turn back and seek within. Viewed through the Dao, there is no noble or base, so one turns back to oneself, naturally at ease and expansive—hence "reversion and overflow." If one binds oneself with distinctions of noble and base, right and wrong, one strays far from the Dao—hence "without constraint in one’s intent, one greatly obstructs the Dao." *Jian* means obstruction. Bestowal entails more or less; when bestowal ceases, there is no more or less—hence "decline and bestowal." If one clings to uniformity in conduct, bound by more or less in bestowal, one deviates from the Dao—hence "without uniformity in one’s conduct, one deviates from the Dao." A state has its ruler, a sacrifice its officiant—both illustrate that this heart takes the Dao as its master, without private virtue or private blessing. This heart is vast, like the four directions without limit, so there is no private division—hence "without boundaries." These three sentences, each with its *qi*, are distinctly placed.

All things are complete within me—this is "embracing the myriad things"—yet without private attachment, hence "who bears them up?" *Cheng yi* describes the intent of private attachment. "Without direction" means "without heart." With no heart of my own, things have no short or long, no life or death. "Do not rely on their completion" echoes the earlier "do not assert completion." Fullness and emptiness follow the time; they cannot be fixed—hence "now empty, now full, they do not abide in form." *Bu wei* means "not fixed." Without past or present, years cannot be lifted; without going or coming, time cannot be halted. The "great meaning" is the great Dao.

Things come to life as if galloping, as if racing—this is what is meant by "that which passes is like this." Change and movement never cease. What is to be done? What is not to be done? All is left to nature’s transformation—hence "they will transform of themselves."

The River Earl said: Then what is noble about the Dao?
The Lord of the Northern Sea said: One who knows the Dao necessarily grasps principle; one who grasps principle necessarily understands adaptability; one who understands adaptability does not allow things to harm the self. The one of utmost virtue—fire cannot burn them, water cannot drown them, cold and heat cannot harm them, birds and beasts cannot injure them. This is not to say they slight these things. It means they discern safety and danger, remain composed amid fortune and misfortune, are cautious in approach and retreat—nothing can harm them. Thus it is said: Heaven is within, man is without; virtue resides in heaven. Know the conduct of heaven and man, root it in heaven, rest in attainment. Advance and retreat, bend and stretch—return to the essential and speak of the ultimate.

This question is also well asked. If one simply follows nature’s transformations, then why should man study the Dao? In Zhu Xi’s *Questions and Answers*, Liao Deming once raised this very question, but Zhu Xi did not answer—perhaps it was difficult to explain. Here, Zhuangzi introduces the term *quan* ("adaptability"), and with the phrase "does not allow things to harm the self," the meaning becomes even clearer. It seems Zhuangzi’s grasp of the Dao was intimate, but readers of his book often fail to see through it.

*Dao* is the all-encompassing term; *li* is the principle inherent in each thing. *Quan* is the application that lies within oneself. Only with the complete substance of the Dao does one attain this great function. One who understands adaptability does not allow things to harm the self—they know the weight of things. The four phrases about water, fire, birds, and beasts each use "cannot," then conclude with "this is not to say," showing how forcefully the argument is constructed. *Bo* means to press close. The person of utmost virtue certainly knows that all things follow their allotted course—how could external things harm them? Yet this does not mean they presume to press close to such things and remain unharmed. For example, though death by water or fire is said to be fate, would one willingly throw oneself into water or fire? The following phrase, "cautious in approach and retreat," makes the meaning even clearer—just as Mencius said, "One who knows fate does not stand beneath a crumbling wall."

Discerning safety and danger, settling fortune and misfortune, being cautious in approach and retreat—this is the human heart within the heart of the Dao. How could it all be left to nature’s spontaneity? Here, Zhuangzi is anything but vague or complacent. "Heaven is within, man is without" echoes the earlier passage: "The ruler is the Way of Heaven; the minister is the way of man." "Virtue resides in heaven" refers to natural virtue. Yet the word "know" in "know the conduct of heaven and man" arises from the human heart. Rooted in nature and content with what is attained—hence "root it in heaven, rest in attainment." This sentence belongs to the heart of the Dao. *Wei* means to dwell in peace. *Zhi ti* means advance and retreat. Advancing and retreating, bending and stretching—each follows its principle. This sentence belongs to the human heart, clarifying the essentials of the Dao and the ultimate of principle—hence "return to the essential and speak of the ultimate," much like Mencius’ "return to the simple and speak of the essential."

The River Earl said: What is heaven? What is man?
The Lord of the Northern Sea said: That oxen and horses have four legs is called heaven; that man places a halter on a horse’s head or a ring through an ox’s nose is called man. Thus it is said: Do not let man obliterate heaven; do not let purpose obliterate fate; do not let gain be sacrificed for fame.

Guard it carefully and do not lose it—this is called returning to one’s true nature. These several lines make the distinction between the human heart and the Dao-heart ever clearer. That oxen and horses have four legs is what they receive from heaven; naturally, they are not haltered or pierced, and thus have no need for such things—this is a matter of the human heart. To let man obliterate heaven, to let purpose obliterate fate, to covet gain and be sacrificed for fame—here the human heart flows into peril. The three phrases beginning with “do not” are prohibitive, much like the “four abstentions.” Having known heaven and also known man, if one guards this carefully and does not lose it, then the heavenly principle is preserved whole. Thus it is said: this is called returning to one’s true nature. Fate is the heavenly principle; purpose is human affairs; gain is the gain and loss of gain.

Kui pitied the centipede; the centipede pitied the snake; the snake pitied the wind; the wind pitied the eye; the eye pitied the heart. Kui said to the centipede: “I go forth with one foot, leaping and striding—none is like me.” Now you deploy ten thousand feet—how can you manage it? The centipede said: “Not so. Have you not seen one who spits? When he sprays, the large drops are like pearls, the small like mist, and those that fall in profusion cannot be counted. Now I move my heavenly mechanism without knowing how it is so.”

The centipede said to the snake: “I go forth with many feet yet do not match you who have none—why is this?” The snake said: “How can one alter what the heavenly mechanism moves? What need have I for feet?” The snake said to the wind: “I move my spine and ribs to go forth, and thus have some semblance of form. Now you rise whirling from the Northern Sea and enter whirling into the Southern Sea, yet seem to have no form—why is this?” The wind said: “Indeed, I rise whirling from the Northern Sea and enter whirling into the Southern Sea. Yet if one points at me, I am overcome; if one treads upon me, I am overcome. Nevertheless, to break great trees and topple great houses—only I can do this. Thus to take many small defeats as a great victory is also a great victory—only the sage can do this.”

Kui has no horns, walks on one foot (see the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*). The centipede is the hundred-footed insect; the snake has no feet. From one foot to no feet, all speak of the movement of the heavenly mechanism in its naturalness—this may be called the most marvelous passage in the world. In between, the comparison of the centipede’s feet to human spittle is also wondrous. At the end, it returns to the wind, while the eye and the heart are left unspoken—such shifts in the text are marvelous and yet more marvelous.

*Trendun* describes the manner of walking on one foot; “none is like me” means none resembles me. “How can one alter it?” means it cannot be changed. “Some semblance” means some visible form. *Pengpeng* is the sound of the wind. “Points at me” means to point at the wind with a hand; “treads upon me” means to tread upon the wind with a foot. Within the discussion of the wind, to add the idea of small defeats making a great victory is yet more marvelous—this is like the saying that “the many can overcome heaven, but heaven’s decree overcomes man.” Though small may not overcome, the great victory means that no thing in the world can escape the workings of creation. What is so of itself cannot be violated.

Confucius was traveling in Song when men of Song surrounded him several layers deep, yet he continued his zither playing and singing without pause. Zilu entered and said: “How can you be so at ease, Master?” Confucius said: “Come, let me tell you. I have long avoided adversity, yet cannot escape it—this is fate. I have long sought success, yet cannot attain it—this is timing. When it was the age of Yao and Shun, there were no men in adversity in the world, not because of their wisdom; when it was the age of Jie and Zhou, there were no successful men in the world, not because of their lack of wisdom. Such is the way of the times. One who travels by water does not avoid dragons and serpents—this is the courage of the fisherman; one who travels by land does not avoid rhinoceroses and tigers—this is the courage of the hunter; one who faces blades crossing before him and sees death as life—this is the courage of the stalwart; one who knows that adversity has its fate, that success has its time, and faces great peril without fear—this is the courage of the sage. You may rest now; my fate is in the hands of another.”

Before long, the armored men came forward to apologize: “We thought you were Yang Hu, so we surrounded you. Now that we know you are not, we beg leave to withdraw.” This passage speaks only of the naturalness of timing and fate, which human effort cannot foresee—what is there to fear? In between, the comparison of the fisherman, hunter, and stalwart to the sage also has its own reason. It is meant to make him cease and desist, without need for further words.

Gongsun Long asked Wei Mou: “In my youth, I studied the Way of the former kings; in maturity, I understood the practice of benevolence and righteousness. I united sameness and difference, separated hardness and whiteness, affirmed the un-affirmable, and denied the un-deniable, confounding the wisdom of the hundred schools and exhausting the eloquence of all disputants—I thought myself most enlightened. Now I hear the words of Zhuangzi and am lost in bewilderment. I do not know whether my reasoning falls short or my knowledge is inferior. Now I have no words to open my beak—may I ask the method?”

Prince Mou sighed deeply, leaned against his armrest, looked up to the sky, and laughed: “Have you alone not heard of the frog in the shallow well? It said to the turtle of the Eastern Sea: ‘How joyful I am! I leap and prance upon the well’s railing, rest at the broken edge of its bricks, plunge into the water to touch my armpits and support my chin, tread in the mud to sink my feet and cover my insteps. Looking around at the shrimp, crabs, and tadpoles, none can match me. Moreover, to possess the water of a single ravine and stand astride the joy of the shallow well—this is the utmost. Why do you not come in from time to time to see?’

The turtle of the Eastern Sea had not yet placed its left foot inside when its right knee was already stuck. Thus it retreated and told the frog of the sea: ‘A distance of a thousand *li* is not enough to describe its greatness; a height of a thousand *ren* is not enough to measure its depth. In the time of Yu, there were nine years of floods, yet the water did not increase; in the time of Tang, there were seven years of drought, yet the shore did not recede. Not to be moved by the passage of time, not to advance or retreat with the quantity of water—this is the great joy of the Eastern Sea.’”

Upon hearing this, the frog of the shallow well was struck with alarm, disoriented and at a loss. Moreover, to seek to comprehend the bounds of right and wrong with the limited understanding one possesses, and yet desire to examine the words of Master Zhuang—this is like commanding a mosquito to bear a mountain or a centipede to race across a river; it is surely beyond one’s capacity. And those who, though unable to fathom the subtleties of profound discourse, yet content themselves with the fleeting gains of the moment—are they not the very frogs of the shallow well?

For he now treads upon the Yellow Springs below and ascends the Great Vault above, unbound by south or north, released in all four directions, submerged in the unfathomable, unrestrained by east or west. Beginning in the dark and mysterious, he returns to the Great Pervasion. Yet you, with your narrow and scrutinizing gaze, seek to grasp this through examination and debate—is this not like peering at the heavens through a tube or measuring the earth with an awl? Is it not petty indeed?

Begone! Have you not heard of the young men of Shouling who went to Handan to learn its way of walking? Before mastering the local skill, they lost even their former gait, and so could only crawl home on all fours. If you do not leave now, you will forget your original ways and lose your own calling.”

Gongsun Long’s jaw dropped and would not close; his tongue lifted and would not descend. Thus he fled in haste. Gongsun Long was among the most eloquent debaters of his time—here his name is invoked merely to refute him. The parables of the well-frog and the sea-turtle are all inventions. How could the mind of this old Master hold so many petty comparisons?

(Note: *hán* are red worms in the well; *xiè* are crabs. In the confines of a shallow well, *hán*, crabs, and tadpoles all move about together, hence the phrase “tadpoles, crabs, and *hán*.” As for the nine years of floods and seven years of drought—this is how people commonly speak, but how could water and drought persist so long? Surely all humankind would perish. Yet when Master Zhuang adds the words “ten years of nine floods” and “eight years of seven droughts,” he sets himself apart from such trivialities, revealing the power of his brush.)

(*Shìshì* means the same as *xìxì*: trembling with fear. *Shāngjù* is a small insect. *Cǐ* means to tread. *Dàhuáng* is heaven. To tread upon the Yellow Springs below and ascend to heaven above is to speak of the loftiness and vastness of his vision. *Shìrán* means the same as *shìrán*: unbound, released in all four directions. *Lún yú bùcè*: to enter into the profound. *Shǐ yú xuánmíng*: to begin in the boundless dark. *Fǎn yú dàtōng*: to return to the Great Pervasion. To seek to exhaust the infinite with the petty clarity of examination and debate—is this not small indeed?)

The parable of losing one’s gait in Handan is especially fine. *Guónéng* refers to the way of walking in Handan. To learn a new skill before mastering it, only to lose one’s former step—this is why they crawled home. What Liezi says of Wei Mou and Gongsun Long differs entirely from this account.

When Master Zhuang was fishing at Pu River, the King of Chu sent two ministers to approach him first, saying, “We wish to burden you with the affairs of our realm.” Master Zhuang, holding his fishing rod, did not turn his head, and said, “I have heard that in Chu there is a sacred turtle, dead for three thousand years. The king keeps it wrapped in silk and stored in a casket in the ancestral temple. Would this turtle rather have died to leave its bones venerated, or lived to drag its tail through the mud?”

The two ministers said, “It would rather live and drag its tail through the mud.”

Master Zhuang said, “Go away. I too will drag my tail through the mud.”

(*Wǎng xiān* means to go and see him first, to convey this meaning beforehand. *Yǐ jìngnèi lěi* means they wished to entrust him with the governance of the state. The parable of the dead turtle leaving its bones versus the living one dragging its tail is truly extraordinary.)

When Huizi was chief minister of Liang, Master Zhuang went to visit him. Someone said to Huizi, “Master Zhuang is coming to replace you as minister.” Thereupon Huizi grew fearful and searched the state for three days and three nights. Master Zhuang went to see him and said, “In the south there is a bird called the *yuānchú*—have you heard of it? The *yuānchú* sets out from the South Sea and flies to the North Sea. It will not perch except on the *wútóng* tree, will not eat except the fruit of the bamboo, and will not drink except from the purest springs. Then a *chī* bird, having obtained a rotting rat, saw the *yuānchú* passing by and looked up, crying, ‘Hè!’ Now do you wish to frighten me with your state of Liang?”

(*Hè* is the sound made to scare away one who might seize its food. To compare the *chī* bird’s rotting rat to Huizi’s state, and the cry of *hè* to his attempt to frighten me—where does this old Master find so many fine parables? From Master Zhuang onward, all who write merely steal his devices. How could the world do without this book? Master Zhuang and Huizi were the closest of friends; this incident likely never occurred, but was a playful jab between them.)

(*Liànshí* is the fruit of the bamboo.)

Master Zhuang and Huizi were strolling on the bridge over the Hao River. Master Zhuang said, “See how the minnows dart about so freely—this is the joy of fish.”

Huizi said, “You are not a fish—how do you know the joy of fish?”

Master Zhuang said, “You are not me—how do you know that I do not know the joy of fish?”

Huizi said, “I am not you, so of course I do not know you. But you are certainly not a fish, so your ignorance of the fish’s joy is complete.”

Master Zhuang said, “Let us return to the beginning. When you said, ‘How do you know the joy of fish?’ you already knew that I knew it when you asked me. I know it here on the Hao River.”

(This exchange is most curious. *Xún qí běn* means to return to the origin. When you first asked, “How do you know the joy of fish?” you already knew my mind, which is why you asked. Since you knew me thus, then I, here on the Hao River, knew the fish in the same way. These two were the closest of friends; one can well imagine their conversation at the time.)

This dialogue between the River Spirit and the Ocean Spirit is much like the exchanges in the *Transmission of the Lamp*, where National Teacher Zhong says, “Preaching without emotion, attaining Buddhahood without intent.” The great master Dahui remarked, “This old Master is so stubborn, and he’s met a monk just as stubborn—they’re stuck in their questions.”

The household thrives, the gates stand wide, the waves surge vast—yet the root of life is severed. These few words from Zhuangzi are most apt.

The detailed remarks of Dahui can be found in his *General Teachings*, Section 4. *The True Classic of Southern Florescence, Proper Meaning*, Scroll Eighteen, concludes here.

*The True Classic of Southern Florescence, Oral Exegesis*, Scroll Nineteen
By Lin Xiyi of Yuanzhai

**Outer Chapters: "Utmost Joy"**

Is there in the world an utmost joy, or is there not? Is there a way to preserve life, or is there not? What should one do? On what should one rely? What should one avoid? Where should one dwell? What should one pursue? What should one forsake? What should one delight in? What should one detest?

What the world honors are wealth, nobility, longevity, and goodness. What it delights in are bodily ease, rich flavors, fine garments, beautiful sights, and harmonious sounds. What it despises are poverty, lowliness, early death, and misfortune. What it suffers are the body denied rest, the mouth denied rich flavors, the form denied fine garments, the eyes denied beautiful sights, and the ears denied harmonious sounds. If one does not obtain these, one is deeply troubled and fearful—how foolish it is to be thus bound to form!

The wealthy exhaust themselves with toil, amassing wealth they cannot fully use—how alienated they are from their own form! The noble pass their days and nights in ceaseless deliberation, weighing good and ill—how estranged they are from their own form! Human life is born with worry, and the long-lived grow dull with age, enduring endless sorrow without death—how distant they are from their own form!

The steadfast knight is praised by the world as good, yet this is not enough to preserve his life. I do not know whether such goodness is truly good or truly not good. If it is good, it does not preserve life; if it is not good, it may preserve others. Thus it is said: "When loyal admonition goes unheeded, withdraw and do not contend." Thus Wu Zixu contended to the point of mutilating his form, yet even without contending, his name was not preserved. Is there truly goodness, or is there not?

Now, as for the world’s pursuits and its joys, I do not know whether its joy is truly joy or truly not joy. I observe the world’s so-called joys: the masses rush together in a frenzy, as if they cannot help themselves, all calling it joy. Yet I find it neither joy nor not joy. Is there truly joy, or is there not?

I hold that non-action is true joy, yet it is what the world deems the greatest suffering. Thus it is said: "Utmost joy is no joy; utmost praise is no praise." The right and wrong of the world cannot truly be settled. Nevertheless, non-action can settle right and wrong. Utmost joy and the preservation of life lie only in non-action, which nearly abides.

This chapter expands upon the previous passage, "Do not let things harm the self." The four phrases beginning with "What should one do? On what should one rely?" ask how one may act rightly, echoing the style of Qu Yuan’s *Encountering Sorrow*. Wealth, nobility, longevity, and goodness—these are four types of people. Good and evil are matters of reputation. "Toil" means laboring diligently. "Deliberating good and ill" means pondering one’s duties with anxiety. "Dull" describes the aged who are no longer clear-minded. The "steadfast knight" is one who seeks reputation. These four passages share the same meaning: all are cases of things harming the self.

Having discussed the three states of nobility, wealth, and longevity, the text now elaborates on the steadfast knight with a shift in phrasing—this is a literary technique. "Withdrawing" is akin to "keeping one’s distance." "Contending for wealth mutilates the form; not contending for fame brings no success"—these two lines expose worldly affairs, showing that striving for reputation to the point of mutilating the form cannot be called good.

The passage beginning "Now, as for the world’s pursuits" concludes the preceding four sections. "The masses rush together" describes the whole world rushing in unison. "In a frenzy" conveys an insistent, grasping intent. They act as if they cannot help themselves, hence "as if they cannot stop." "I find it neither joy nor not joy" means that I do not understand the world’s notions of joy and not-joy—this expresses deep disdain. Yet I take non-action as joy, while the world sees it as great suffering.

Utmost joy lies in no joy; utmost praise lies in no praise. But who among the world’s people knows the joy of no-joy or the praise of no-praise? Thus, the right and wrong of the world cannot truly be settled. Nevertheless, only non-action can settle right and wrong. In these few lines, one must recognize the rise and fall of the text to appreciate its excellence. "Nearly abides" means that through non-action, joy is nearly preserved.

Let me attempt to explain: Heaven is clear through non-action; Earth is tranquil through non-action. When the two non-actions unite, the myriad things are transformed. Vague and indistinct, without origin; indistinct and vague, without form. The ten thousand things flourish abundantly, all growing from non-action. Thus it is said: "Heaven and Earth practice non-action, yet nothing is left undone." Who among men can attain non-action?

These lines conclude the preceding discussion. Only when the two non-actions unite can the myriad things be transformed—this is "non-action yet nothing left undone." "Without origin" means no trace of beginning. "Grow" means to be born. All things arise naturally, hence "all grow from non-action."

From "Is there in the world an utmost joy" to "can one attain non-action?" this passage is a single piece of writing, with its rises and falls most worthy of contemplation.

When Zhuangzi’s wife died, Huizi came to offer condolences. Zhuangzi was squatting, drumming on a basin and singing. Huizi said: "To live with someone, raise a child to old age, and then, when they die, not weep would be enough—yet you drum on a basin and sing. Is this not excessive?" Zhuangzi replied: "Not so. When she first died, how could I alone be without sorrow? Yet I considered her beginning: originally, there was no life. Not only was there no life, but originally there was no form. Not only was there no form, but originally there was no qi."

Amidst the boundless and indistinct, transformation gives rise to qi; qi transforms into form, and form transforms into life. Now, it transforms again into death—this is like the succession of spring, autumn, winter, and summer, the ceaseless progression of the four seasons. A man lies at peace within the vast chamber, yet I wail and weep after him, believing myself to be ignorant of fate—thus I cease.

"Form transforms into life" means that form precedes the movement and activity of life. The Buddhists say that movement and turning belong to the wind, which is what this "life" refers to. They also say: in the eyes, it is seeing; in the ears, it is hearing; in the hands, it is grasping; in the feet, it is running—this is what "life" means. The progression of the four seasons is a metaphor for the inevitability of death following life. This passage elucidates the principle that life and death are one continuous process.

The tale of drumming on the basin is but an allegory. Consider Yuan Rang, who climbed a tree and sang at his parent’s death—could he truly have been devoid of human feeling? If he were entirely without human feeling, he would be a jackal or a wolf. Would the Master still have befriended him? The teachings of the sagely school aim to fulfill the duties of filial piety and reverence—how could they be ignorant of the principle of life and death? Yuan Rang, Zhuangzi, and their like sought to shatter the delusions of the human heart, and so they resorted to such excessive acts.

This is why the Daoist mind is so subtle and cannot be practiced in isolation in the world, hence the teaching of "holding to the mean." Did Zhuangzi and Liezi not understand this? They merely sought to correct the world’s weariness of convention, and so they put forth such arguments.

When Li Hanlao mourned his son and asked Dahui, fearing that his inability to forget his emotions might distance him from the Dao, Dahui replied: "If you did not weep for your dead son, you would be a jackal or a wolf." This elder’s words reveal profound insight. Other Buddhists, when asked such a question, would surely have spoken nonsense.

Zhili Shu and Hua Jieshu were observing the mound of Mingbo, the wasteland of Kunlun, and the place where the Yellow Emperor once rested. Suddenly, a growth appeared on Hua Jieshu’s left elbow, and he frowned in displeasure. Zhili Shu asked: "Do you dislike it?" Hua Jieshu replied: "No, why should I dislike it? Life is but a temporary borrowing. What borrows and gives rise to life is mere dust and grime. Life and death are like day and night. Moreover, you and I observe transformation, and transformation reaches me—why should I dislike it?"

"Hua Jieshu" implies a sense of humor—such a name must have been invented. "Where the Yellow Emperor rested" means the Emperor once rested there. "Liu" refers to a sore; today, people call it a boil. It seems such a term existed in ancient times. "Frowning in displeasure" expresses the sentiment of one afflicted by illness.

"Temporary borrowing" means this body is formed by the temporary convergence of external things. "Dust and grime" means that within the workings of creation, it is utterly insignificant and unworthy of esteem. The Buddhist idea of the "four conditions converging to form a false body"—and now, where is this illusory body?—truly originates from this.

"Observing transformation" means witnessing the changes of all things. "Transformation reaches me" means that I, too, will follow the Creator in transformation. Earlier, he frowned in displeasure, but now he says, "Why should I dislike it?" The statements seem contradictory. Yet displeasure in illness is human nature; understanding the principle of life and death and recognizing its origin is where the Daoist mind prevails.

When Zhuangzi traveled to Chu, he saw an empty skull, still intact in shape. He tapped it with his horse whip and asked: "Did you, sir, covet life and lose reason, becoming like this? Or did you suffer the fall of a state, the execution by axe, and become like this? Or did you commit some unworthy deed, bringing shame upon your parents, wife, and children, and become like this? Or did you endure the miseries of cold and hunger and become like this? Or did your years naturally come to this end?"

Having spoken, he took the skull as a pillow and lay down. In the middle of the night, the skull appeared to him in a dream and said: "Your words resemble those of a debater. All that you mentioned are the burdens of the living—death is free of them. Would you like to hear the truth of death?" Zhuangzi said: "Yes." The skull replied: "In death, there is no ruler above, no subject below, nor the affairs of the four seasons. At ease, with heaven and earth as spring and autumn, even the joy of a king facing south cannot surpass it."

Zhuangzi, unconvinced, said: "If I had the Controller of Fate restore your form, giving you bones, flesh, and skin, returning you to your parents, wife, children, neighbors, and friends, would you desire it?" The skull furrowed its brow deeply and said: "How could I abandon the joy of a king facing south and return to the toils of the human world?"

"Rao ran" describes the appearance of emptiness and solidity.

"Congran" signifies a state of ease and self-contentment. "All that you mentioned" refers to everything previously spoken of. This passage discusses the principle of life and death, introducing the peculiar dialogue with the skull. Readers should grasp its intent and not take it as literal speech.

When Yan Yuan journeyed east to Qi, Confucius wore a troubled expression. Zigong stepped from his mat and asked: "This student dares to inquire—why does the Master appear troubled as Yan Yuan travels to Qi?" Confucius replied: "Your question is excellent. Formerly, Guanzi spoke words I deeply admired: 'A small sack cannot hold a large object; a short rope cannot draw from a deep well.' Such is the way of things—fate has its completion, and form has its proper place, neither to be diminished nor augmented. I fear that Yan Yuan, in speaking to the Marquis of Qi of the Dao of Yao, Shun, and the Yellow Emperor, and further adding the words of Suiren and Shennong, will cause the Marquis to search within himself and find nothing. Finding nothing, he will be perplexed; perplexed, he will perish.

Have you not heard this before? Once, a seabird alighted in the outskirts of Lu. The Lord of Lu received it and offered it wine in the ancestral temple, performed the *Jiu Shao* as music, and prepared an ox, sheep, and pig as a feast. Yet the bird only gazed in dizziness and sorrow, refusing to eat a single morsel or drink a single cup, and died within three days. This was nourishing the bird with what nourishes man, not with what nourishes birds. To properly nourish a bird, one should let it roost in deep forests, roam the sandy plains, float upon rivers and lakes, feed on loaches and minnows, rest in formation, and dwell in tranquility. It detests the sound of human speech—why then subject it to clamor?

When the music of *Xian Chi* and *Jiu Shao* is played in the wilds of Dongting, birds hear it and fly away, beasts hear it and flee, fish hear it and dive deep, while men, upon hearing it, turn back to observe. Fish live in water, yet men die in it—they must differ, for their likes and dislikes are not the same. Thus, the sages of old did not unify abilities or standardize affairs; names were confined to reality, and principles were set according to what was fitting. This is called 'orderly attainment and the preservation of fortune.'

A *chu* is a cloth sack; a *geng* is the rope used to draw water from a well. This illustrates the idea that small strength cannot bear great burdens. Fate and form, bestowed by Heaven, each have their fixed measure, neither to be diminished nor augmented. To speak to the Marquis of Qi of the Dao of the ancient sages, without the power to move or transform him, would invite blame upon myself. This passage uses Yan Yuan to satirize the persuaders of the present age.

What nourishes birds is not what nourishes men; to feed a bird with human food violates its nature. The meaning is simply that one should not speak where speech is unfit, for to do so is to speak amiss. The Confucian school has but a single principle, yet here it is expanded into vast and sweeping discourse.

*Yu* (御) means to receive and offer wine; *shang* (觞) means to drink. *Tan* (坛) is pronounced like *dan* (但) and is the same as *chan* (澶), referring to sandy plains in riverlands. 'Not unifying abilities' means that human talents differ; 'not standardizing affairs' means each attends to their proper task. Names are confined to what is real, and principles are set according to what is fitting—thus, 'names are confined to reality, and principles are set according to what is fitting.' This means each follows their allotted place.

'Orderly attainment' means proceeding directly without strain; 'preservation of fortune' means that fortune endures. To hold (持) is to preserve. Not undertaking what exceeds one’s capacity avoids strain and preserves life, free from harm. The meaning is no more than this.

Liezi was traveling and eating by the roadside when he saw a century-old skull. Pulling aside the overgrown grass, he pointed to it and said: "Only you and I know that you have never died, never lived. If indeed you were nourished, would I indeed be joyful?" There are seeds of all kinds: when they obtain water, they become *gan*; at the water’s edge, they become the moss of frogs and toads; growing on mounds, they become *lingxi*; *lingxi* that obtains *yuqi* becomes *niaozu*; the root of *niaozu* becomes *qicao*, its leaves become butterflies. Butterflies, in time, transform into insects, born beneath the stove, resembling cast-off skins, named *quduo*. After a thousand days, *quduo* becomes a bird called *ganyugu*; the foam of *ganyugu* becomes *simi*, and *simi* becomes *shihai*. *Yixia* is born from *shihai*, *huangkuang* from *jiuyou*, *maorui* from rotten silkworms, and *yangxi* is akin to *busun*. Old bamboo gives rise to *qingning*, *qingning* to *cheng*, *cheng* to horses, and horses to men. Men, in turn, return to the mechanism. All things emerge from the mechanism and return to the mechanism.

'From seeing' means seeing as a consequence. 'Pulling aside the overgrown grass' refers to the skull lying amid the grass, which he drew aside to point at it. 'Nourishment' refers to eating and drinking in life; 'joy' refers to the stillness of extinction in death. Yet here it is expressed in such terms—this is merely playing with marvels in writing.

'You and I' refer to the skull. This 'joy' is the bliss of stillness and extinction. 'Seeds of all kinds' means that among the myriad things between Heaven and Earth, the seeds of life differ. Below, the most minute are described—not as a small metaphor for the great, but to show that the great is no different from the small. This conveys the idea of no small or great, no noble or base. The meaning is simply this, yet the artistry of the writing is unparalleled across the ages. Amid order, there is disorder; amid disorder, order—like watching scattered geese in flight, like gazing upon solitary peaks and rugged slopes. The more one reads, the finer it becomes. Liezi adds two sentences here, which would have been better omitted. *Gan* is the scum on water, the first growth of moss, not yet fully formed, with threads intertwined—yet it is a most minute thing.

The "clothing" of the turtle and freshwater mussel is none other than green moss. The "water-and-earth juncture" refers to where water clings to the bank—such places are typically lush and thick, hence called "clothing." Though these two lines speak of green moss, they then turn to the *lingtun*, the high ground in the fields. *Lingxi* is *cheqian* grass. *Yuqi* is manure and soil. When *cheqian* grass grows amid manure and soil, it transforms into *niaozu* grass; the roots of *niaozu* further metamorphose into *qicao*, while its leaves become butterflies. *Qicao* is the grub of the scarab beetle. *Xu* is another name for the butterfly. The addition of this line beneath the butterfly is especially striking.

Below, it speaks again of creatures born from transformation—those beneath the stove, some of which are called *quduo*, soft and without skin or grain, hence said to be "as if shed," like the silkworm today. *Quduo* can further transform into a bird called *ganyugu*, the "dried remnant bone." *Simi* is an insect. Its foam becomes another insect. *Shihai* is the *yimeng* midge. *Yimeng* transforms into *yilu*, *yilu* into *jiuyou*, *jiuyou* into *huanghuang*, *huanghuang* into *fuxuan*, and *fuxuan* into *maorui*. Here, two lines are omitted with the phrase "born from," a stylistic choice. *Huanghuang*, *jiuyou*, *fuxuan*, and *maorui* are all names of insects. The meaning here is that the transformations of the myriad things are ceaseless, their generation without end.

The preceding section having been expounded, it concludes with the most bizarre examples—this is where it startles the common world. Do not take it as literal truth. *Yangxi* is a type of grass. Grass resembling bamboo but not producing shoots is called "non-shooter." While the shoots of old bamboo are edible, these are not. *Qingning* is an insect. *Cheng* is also an insect, and *ma* is a grass, what is now called purslane or *malan* grass. *Ren* is also a grass, what is now called ginseng or *renmianzi*. Clearly, many grass names are used, yet the characters for "horse" and "man" are deliberately employed to craft strange and uncanny names. Previous commentators have all deemed these obscure, showing that for ten thousand generations, people have been baffled by Zhuangzi, unable to see through his artifice.

The transformations of the myriad things—such as the sparrow becoming a clam, the hawk into a turtledove, rotting grass into fireflies, or the rat into a bat—show that nothing fails to enter the mechanism. This speaks of returning to the ultimate end. To "emerge from the mechanism" and "enter the mechanism" is to emerge from and enter death and life—it is the transmission of fire, the unknowing of its end.

The *Outer Chapters: "Attaining Life"* by Lin Xiyi of Yanzhai

One who attains the essence of life does not pursue what is of no use to life. One who attains the essence of fate does not strive after what knowledge cannot master. To nourish the body, one must first rely on things, yet there are cases where things are in excess while the body remains unnourished. To have life, one must first not depart from the body, yet there are cases where the body does not depart while life perishes. Life’s coming cannot be refused, nor can its going be halted—how lamentable that the people of the world believe nourishing the body suffices to preserve life, yet nourishing the body ultimately does not suffice to preserve life. If this is so, what in the world is worth doing? Though it may not be worth doing, one cannot but do it, for such doing is inescapable.

To escape doing for the body’s sake, nothing surpasses abandoning the world. Fleeing the world means being without entanglements; without entanglements, one is upright and equanimous; upright and equanimous, one renews life with the Other; renewing life, one approaches the ultimate. What need is there to abandon affairs? What need is there to cling to life? Abandoning affairs, the body is not wearied; forgetting life, the essence is not depleted. When the body is whole and essence restored, one becomes one with Heaven. Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things: united, they form a body; dispersed, they return to the beginning. When form and essence are not depleted, this is called "the power to transform." Refining essence further and further, one returns to assist Heaven.

What is "of no use to life" refers to things external to the body—such as how many pairs of shoes a person wears in a lifetime, or how many spoons they use in a day. What "knowledge cannot master" refers to what lies beyond human power. Nourishing the body must rely on things, and having life must preserve the body—this is the common view of the world. Yet things are often in excess, while the body does not endure forever; the body may be preserved, yet life has its end. Thus it is said: there are cases where things are in excess yet the body is not nourished, and cases where the body does not depart yet life perishes. Though it may not be worth doing, one cannot but do it—this is what was previously meant by "nothing is worth doing, yet one cannot but do it." "Inescapable" means that whether one acts or not, one cannot avoid self-entanglement. To escape self-entanglement, nothing suffices but abandoning the world.

Abandoning the world does not mean fleeing it; it means dwelling in the world with a mind free of intent, responding only when moved, acting only when compelled, rising only when unavoidable. Then the self remains the self, and the world remains the world. "Upright and equanimous" means the mind is without preference or discrimination—akin to the Buddhist saying, "All dharmas are equal." "Renewing life" means becoming inexhaustible with the Other; the Other is the Creator. Moving in unison with the Creator, one is renewed day by day, hence "renewing life with the Other." At this point, one reaches the ultimate—*ji* (the ultimate) means "exhaustion." Knowing this, the affairs external to the body and the life one clings to are abandoned of themselves, without need for deliberate abandonment.

"Essence restored" means the spirit is not scattered outward. "United, they form a body" refers to the four great elements combining to form the body; "dispersed, they return to the beginning"—the beginning being the origin before things existed. "Form and essence" here means body and spirit. When body and spirit are not depleted, they possess the power to transform, hence "the power to transform." *Transform* means *change*. When one embodies the Dao to this degree, refining essence further and further, one can then assist in creation. "Assisting Heaven" means aiding Heaven. These two instances of *essence* differ from *form and essence* above. *Return* means *revert*—to serve and thereby return.

When Liezi asked Guanyin, "The perfected person walks underwater without obstruction, treads fire without heat, and moves above the myriad things without fear. May I ask how one attains this?" Guanyin replied, "This is the preservation of pure qi, not the realm of knowledge, skill, courage, or daring. Stay, and I will tell you. All that has form, image, sound, or color belongs to things. How can things be distant from one another? Why should one strive to surpass them? They are but appearances. Things arise from the formless and cease where transformation ends. One who fully attains this cannot be limited by things. They dwell within the measure of non-excess, abide in the principle without origin, and roam through the beginning and end of the myriad things. Unifying their nature, nurturing their qi, harmonizing their virtue, they commune with the source of things. One who is thus has their Heavenly endowment intact, their spirit unobstructed—how could things enter them?

Consider the drunkard who falls from a cart: though the fall is swift, he does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs—his spirit is whole. He is unaware of riding, unaware of falling; life and death, terror and fear do not enter his breast. Thus he is not daunted by things. If one who is whole through wine is like this, how much more so one who is whole through Heaven? The sage hides in Heaven, and thus nothing can harm them.

A man seeking vengeance does not break the sword’s blade; even one with a vengeful heart does not resent a tile fallen by chance. Thus the world is in balance: there are no wars of aggression, no punishments of execution. This is the way of such a Dao. Do not open the Heavenly in man but open the Heavenly of Heaven. Opening the Heavenly gives birth to virtue; opening the human harms life. Do not weary of Heaven, nor neglect the people—thus one approaches the authentic.

"Walking underwater without obstruction" means moving silently without hindrance. "Moving above the myriad things without fear" is like riding the wind. "Preservation of pure qi" means guarding the original qi, keeping it unified and unadulterated. "Knowledge" refers to cunning; "skill" to force. This matter cannot be achieved through cunning or force. Though these words may seem impractical, the principle is real—observe today’s practitioners of qi-cultivation, and you will see.

"Form, image, sound, color" refer to having traces. All things in the world are bound by form; if I too have traces, I am no different from them—how then can I surpass what existed before things? People, confined to their single bodies, cannot perceive the beginning of the myriad things—all because they are burdened by traces. Thus it is said, "They are but appearances." *Appearance* means *traces*."

"Form, image, sound, color"—above, all four characters were listed, but here only one is cited; this is a matter of literary technique.

The Creator of things has no form, hence it is said, "things are created from the formless." Without end or beginning, unified and undivided, it is thus said to "abide where there is no transformation." *Transformation* means *change*; this speaks of its unchanging nature. To grasp this and exhaust its wonders is to comprehend the principle of creation.

To attain this principle and plumb its depths is to distance oneself far from the realm of existing things, hence it is said, "How could things be divided?" *Excess* means *disorder* and *instability*. *The measure of non-excess* is the unchanging standard. *The beginning without origin* is the inception before things. *Beginning* here means *principle*.

The end and beginning of the myriad things is creation. To unify one’s nature is to keep it pure and undivided. To harmonize one’s virtue is to maintain its wholeness without separation. To merge with the Creator is thus said to "penetrate to what things are created from."

To call it *Heaven* or *Spirit* is to refer to this principle within me. *Without division* means *without gap*. When what is within is complete and without gap, how can external things enter?

"Unmoved by things" means that though touched by things, one’s spirit remains undisturbed, hence unafraid. The analogy of the drunken man falling from a cart is most precise. "Hidden in Heaven" means none can harm him—this is the earlier passage on "not allowing things to harm oneself," which is called *non-action*.

A sword may wound a man, a flying tile may strike him, yet he feels no anger—because these things have no intent. These two lines serve as an analogy for *no-mind*, and their reasoning is most sound.

"Balanced throughout the world" means acting without preference or aversion. Where there is contention, there is war, slaughter, and strife; but if I have no mind, there is no contention—how then could such things arise? The *Heaven of man* still has mind, while the *Heaven of Nature* has no mind.

*Opening* means *illuminating*. *Virtue that gives life* is natural virtue. To "open man’s Heaven" is to leave the heart untransformed; if the heart remains untransformed, the six senses become six thieves—how much more so external things?

"Not rejecting one’s Heaven" means not abandoning one’s heavenly principle. "Not neglecting the human" means that while one does not disregard worldly affairs requiring action, one acts without contrivance. Thus one approaches the truth of reality—*approaches*, for it is near.

When Confucius traveled to Chu, he emerged from a forest and saw a hunchback catching cicadas with a pole as easily as if picking them up. Confucius said, "You are skillful—do you have a method?" The man replied, "I do. For five or six months, I balance two pellets on the pole without dropping them, and I lose only a few. With three pellets, I lose only one in ten. With five, it is as easy as picking them up."

"I hold my body still as a tree stump, and my arm steady as a withered branch. Though Heaven and Earth are vast and the myriad things numerous, I am aware only of the cicada’s wings. I do not turn or sway, nor do I let the myriad things distract me from the cicada’s wings—how could I fail?"

Confucius turned to his disciples and said, "When the will is undivided, it becomes concentrated in spirit." This describes the hunchbacked old man. *Catching cicadas* means using a pole to snare them. Balancing nine pellets on the pole’s tip—from two to five without dropping them—shows such concentration that one enters the realm of spirit. Guo Xiang’s use of "stillness" and "focus" here is also apt.

*A tree stump* is what we now call a *wooden stake*. *Root* means *stake*, *stump* is the name of the wood, and *fixed* means *immobile*. It seems these three characters existed in ancient times. *Not turning or swaying* simply means *concentration*. While catching cicadas, his body was as motionless as a wooden stake, his arm like a withered branch, yet his mind was fixed solely on the cicada, unaware of anything else—this is the height of purity.

"When the will is undivided" means the will is single-minded. "Concentrated in spirit" means focused to the point of spiritual mastery. Though this analogy illustrates the preservation of pure *qi*, such things truly exist in the world—even today—but people regard them as mere skill and do not recognize the Dao within.

*A hunchback* is one whose back is bent. Yan Yuan asked Confucius, "I once crossed the deep abyss of Shang. The ferryman handled the boat as if by magic. I asked him, 'Can one learn to handle a boat?' He said, 'Yes—those skilled in swimming can learn quickly. As for divers, they can handle a boat without ever having seen one.' I pressed him, but he would not explain. May I ask what he meant?"

Confucius said, "Those skilled in swimming can learn quickly because they have forgotten the water. As for divers who can handle a boat without ever having seen one—they see the abyss as level ground and a capsized boat as merely a cart rolling backward. Though countless dangers lie before them, they do not enter their minds—where could they find leisure to fear?"

"One who stakes tiles is skillful; one who stakes hooks is hesitant; one who stakes gold is troubled—yet their skill is the same. Where there is attachment, the weight is external." Whoever values externals is clumsy within.

*Shang* is the name of a deep abyss. *Swimming* means floating on the surface. *Divers* are those who submerge in water. A skilled diver sees water as level ground, so he can handle a boat without learning. Though countless dangers arise, his mind remains undisturbed—hence it is said, "they do not enter their minds." The mind is the dwelling of spirit and clarity.

*Staking* means *shooting at a target*. *To gaze at the object* is called *staking*. Wang Qinruo once said, "To make Your Majesty a lone stake"—this is the same *stake* character.

One who stakes tiles has no concern for gain or loss; one who stakes hooks begins to feel attachment; one who stakes gold grows more attached and thus more troubled. *Attachment* means *cherishing*. The archer’s skill is fundamentally the same, but when there is attachment, what is valued lies outside, and the mind becomes confused.

When the mind is confused, even the most skillful may at times become clumsy.

Having answered the question, he further seals it with this analogy—these two metaphors both embody the supreme principle of the world. Observe how the flow of his prose rises and concludes, itself most singular.

Tian Kaizhi visited Duke Wei of Zhou. The Duke said, “I have heard that Zhu Shen was a student of learning. You have kept company with Zhu Shen—what have you learned from him?”

Tian Kaizhi replied, “Kaizhi’s duty is but to grasp the broom and attend the gate—what could I have learned from the Master?”

The Duke said, “Tianzi, do not decline. I wish to hear it.”

Kaizhi said, “I heard the Master say: ‘One who nurtures life well is like a shepherd—he watches for those lagging behind and whips them forward.’”

The Duke asked, “What does this mean?”

Tian Kaizhi said, “In Lu there was a man named Shan Bao who dwelled in the cliffs and drank from streams, sharing no profit with the people. At seventy, his complexion remained that of a child. Unluckily, he encountered a starving tiger, which killed and devoured him. There was also a man named Zhang Yi who ran to every high gate and hanging curtain, yet at forty he died of internal heat. Bao nurtured his inner self, but the tiger consumed his outer; Yi nurtured his outer, but illness assailed his inner. These two men both failed to whip the laggards forward.”

*Ba hui* means *to grasp the broom*—*ba* as in *uprooting*, holding the broom to tend the gate, fulfilling the disciple’s duty of sweeping.

Shepherding sheep is naturally left to their own course, but if some fall behind and fail to follow the flock, they must be whipped forward. This implies that while one follows the Dao of Heaven, one must also fulfill human effort.

Shan Bao was a recluse yet was slain by a tiger; Zhang Yi frequented the houses of the rich and noble, though spared the harm of tigers, yet perished from inner turmoil and internal heat. Both cases show that human effort was incomplete—one cannot simply entrust all to Heaven.

This passage is most intimate to those who study the Dao, and from it one may infer Zhuangzi’s intent in expounding the Dao of Heaven and the Dao of Man throughout his work. First he sets forth the analogy, then confirms it with two examples—his prose is singular indeed.

Confucius said: “Do not retreat and hide away; do not advance and display yourself; stand like a withered tree in the center. If these three are attained, one’s name will surely reach the utmost.”

“Do not retreat and hide away” means not to be fixated on stillness. “Do not advance and display yourself” means not to be bound to activity. “Stand like a withered tree” describes standing without intent, its form like dead wood. Movement and stillness have no constancy, and one does not lean to either side—thus it is said, “stand in the center.” The “three” refer to the three phrases above; mastering these three, one may be called a Perfected Person. Hence it is said, “If these three are attained, one’s name will surely reach the utmost”—*utmost* meaning *supreme*.

Those who fear the road where ten kill one will warn their fathers, sons, and brothers, and only dare to venture forth with a great company of armed men—are they not wise in what men truly fear? Yet in the intimacy of bed and mat, in the midst of food and drink, they remain unaware of the need for caution—this is their error.

Drawing an analogy between the perilous road and the bedchamber conveys the same meaning as “the axe that hews life through the allure of moth-eyebrows”—this is a warning to restrain desire. Even sages and worthies, upon hearing Zhuangzi’s words, would surely nod in assent. How could this be the teaching of a heterodox school?

The invocator dons dark ceremonial robes to approach the pen and address the swine, saying: "Why do you abhor death? I shall rear you for three months as a sacrificial beast, purify you for ten days, fast for three, and spread white couch-grass beneath you. Then I shall place you, shoulder and haunch, upon the carved offering-tray—would you consent to this?" For the swine, he counsels: "Better to be fed husks and dregs and left in the pen." Yet for himself, he reasons: "If living brings the honor of high carriage and cap, and dying grants one a place upon the patterned bier amid woven bamboo, then so be it."

For the swine, he rejects such a fate; for himself, he embraces it. What, then, makes him different from the swine? *Dark ceremonial robes*: the cap of office. *Rear*: to nourish with fodder. *Haunch*: the hindquarters of the pig. *Patterned*: akin to *seal-script*, referring to the carved designs on the bier. *Bier*: the frame of the funerary platform. A frame adorned with patterns is called a *pig-bier*. *Woven*: bent, as in objects that gather things—baskets and containers of that sort. Earlier texts refer to *woven bamboo* as *bent strips*; thus we know this too is a bamboo vessel. In the second year of Duke Xuan of Lu, a pen-keeper roasted a bear’s paw improperly, killed him, and placed the body in a basket—this is of the same kind.

To live with the nobility of high carriage and cap, yet die by execution and be cast upon a stumbling-block, amid coarse baskets, and still find contentment—this is what Han Yu meant by "dwelling in filth without shame, meeting execution and death without remorse." To counsel the swine thus, yet choose otherwise for oneself—this analogy may be called apt.

Duke Huan was hunting in the marshes, with Guan Zhong driving his chariot, when he saw a ghost. The duke grasped Guan Zhong’s hand and asked, “What did you see, Father Zhong?” Guan Zhong replied, “Your servant saw nothing.” Upon returning, the duke fell ill from distress and did not emerge for several days. A Qi scholar named Huangzi Gao’ao said, “The duke has merely harmed himself—how could a ghost harm him? When pent-up qi scatters and does not return, it causes deficiency; when it rises but does not descend, it makes one prone to anger; when it sinks but does not rise, it makes one prone to forgetfulness. If it neither rises nor sinks but lodges in the middle of the body, striking the heart, it causes illness.”

Duke Huan asked, “Then do ghosts exist?” Huangzi replied, “They do. In the depths of the marsh, there is *Lü*; in the stove, there is *Ji*. The foul earth within the door is where *Leiting* dwells. Beneath the northeast corner of the house lurks *Bei’e Xielong*; beneath the northwest, *Yiyang* resides. In water, there is *Wangxiang*; on mounds, *Zhen*; in mountains, *Kui*; in the wild, *Fanghuang*; and in the marshes, *Weiyi*.”

The duke asked, “What does *Weiyi* look like?” Huangzi said, “*Weiyi* is as thick as a wheel hub and as long as a chariot shaft. It wears purple robes and a crimson cap. As a creature, it is fearsome—when it hears the rumble of thunder-chariots, it clasps its head and stands erect. Whoever sees it is destined for hegemony.”

Duke Huan laughed heartily and said, “This is what I saw!” He then straightened his robes and cap, sat with Huangzi, and before the day was out, his illness had vanished. This account resembles the tale of the *peishe*, though it is more extraordinary. *Eyi* is like the sound of retching—an ailment of reversed qi. *Fenchu* is stagnation. When illness strikes the body’s center, affecting the heart, it is what people today call a *zhongguan* malady.

*Shen* refers to the mud of ditches, where *Lü* dwells; *Ji* is another spirit of the stove. *Fanrang* is filthy earth, where *Leiting* resides. *Bei’e Xielong* is the ghost of the northeast corner of a house, while *Yiyang* inhabits the northwest. The above names all refer to spirits dwelling in households. *Wangxiang* is the spirit of water; *Zhen*, the spirit of small mounds; *Kui*, the spirit of mountains; *Fanghuang*, the spirit of the wild; and *Weiyi*, the spirit of great marshes. Since Duke Huan saw the ghost in the marshes, he inquired specifically about *Weiyi*. At first, he mistook it for an omen and fell ill from fear, but upon learning that seeing it foretold hegemony, he rejoiced, and his illness vanished. *Zhenran* describes the manner of his laughter.

This parable differs from the one about seeing a pig bearing mud or a cartload of ghosts, yet since the Sage included such words in the hexagrams, such things must exist in the world—there is no need for surprise.

Ji Xiaozhi was raising fighting cocks for the king. After ten days, the king asked, “Are the cocks ready?” Ji replied, “Not yet—they are still hollow and arrogant, relying on their qi.” After another ten days, the king asked again, and Ji said, “Not yet—they still respond to shadows and echoes.” After another ten days, the king asked, and Ji said, “Not yet—they still glare fiercely and bristle with qi.” After another ten days, the king asked, and Ji said, “Nearly so. Though other cocks may crow, they show no change. From a distance, they resemble wooden cocks—their virtue is complete. No other cock dares challenge them; they turn and flee.”

Responding to sounds and reacting to shadows means the heart is still moved by external things. “Glaring fiercely and bristling with qi” describes their spirit and qi flourishing. Earlier, they were “hollow and arrogant, relying on qi,” meaning their qi was still external; now, “glaring fiercely and bristling with qi” means their qi is internal. The word *ji* implies anger—it means a fixed gaze, not the same as a commoner gripping his sword and glaring. When they appear like wooden cocks, their spirit and qi are fully integrated. This passage uses cocks as a metaphor for the study of guarding one’s qi.

Confucius observed the Lüliang Falls, where the water plunged thirty *ren* and its foam stretched forty *li*, a place where turtles, alligators, fish, and soft-shelled turtles could not swim. He saw a man swimming there and thought he was in distress, seeking death. He sent his disciples to follow the current and rescue him. After several hundred paces, the man emerged, his hair unbound, singing as he strolled beneath the embankment.

Confucius approached and asked, “I took you for a ghost, but upon closer inspection, you are a man. May I ask if there is a method to treading water?” The man replied, “No, I have no method. I began with my origins, grew with my nature, and completed it with fate. I enter with the swirl and emerge with the surge, following the water’s way without imposing my will. This is how I tread it.”

Confucius asked, “What do you mean by beginning with origins, growing with nature, and completing with fate?” The man said, “I was born on the hills and am at ease on the hills—this is my origin. I grew up in water and am at ease in water—this is my nature. I do not know why I am so, yet I am so—this is fate.” This passage shares the same meaning as the earlier discussion of steering a boat.

*Bingliu* means following the current. *Gu* refers to one’s inherent state—Mencius said, “Those who speak of nature refer only to *gu*.” Nature and fate are the principles of spontaneity. *Qi* refers to the swirling of water; *gu*, to its surging. “Entering and emerging” means rising and falling with the water. “Following the water’s way without imposing my will” means going with the flow, not against it. Being born on the hills and at ease there, growing up in water and at ease there—all arise from following one’s nature without knowing why. The three terms *gu*, *xing*, and *ming* are initially undifferentiated; they are merely used this way in writing. To force meanings onto the words *sheng* (birth) and *zhang* (growth) would be a mistake.

Master Qing of Zi carved wood into a *ju*. When it was finished, those who saw it marveled as if it were the work of ghosts or spirits. The Marquis of Lu saw it and asked, “What technique did you use?” Master Qing replied, “I am but a craftsman—what technique could I have? Nevertheless, there is one thing.”

When I set out to carve the *ju*, I never dared to waste my *qi*—I first fasted to still my mind. After three days of fasting, I no longer dared to harbor thoughts of rewards, ranks, or emoluments. After five days, I no longer dared to harbor thoughts of praise or blame, skill or clumsiness. After seven days, I would suddenly forget that I had limbs or a body. At that moment, I was no longer aware of the court; my craft became single-minded, and all external distractions dissolved. Only then did I enter the mountain forests to observe the natural essence of things, where the form of the wood revealed itself in its fullness. Only then did the *ju* appear before me, and only then did I set my hand to it—otherwise, I would have stopped. Thus, I merged my nature with the nature of the wood. This is how the vessel gathers spirit—is it not so?

The *ju* resembles the *jiazhong* bell, though this is merely the interpretation of commentators. Since bells are made of metal, how could carved wood achieve the same? In my humble opinion, the *Da Guan Lei Pian* states that the *ju* is the ornament on bells and drums, akin to the *sun* and *□* (brackets) used to suspend them. These ornaments, shaped like birds or beasts and carved from wood with exquisite precision, can be seen in the *Kaogong Ji*. That people marveled as if it were the work of ghosts or spirits speaks to its unparalleled craftsmanship—beyond what any human could achieve.

"Wasting *qi*" means the *qi* is unsettled. Fasting stills the mind, and only then does the *qi* settle. Not harboring thoughts of rank or emolument, not harboring thoughts of praise or blame, forgetting one’s limbs—this means guarding the pure *qi* and shutting out external things. "No longer aware of the court" means even the thought of the court vanishes. Only thus does the mind’s skill become focused, and all external things that might disturb it dissolve and fade away.

"Entering the mountain forests to observe the natural essence" means observing the nature of the wood. Each piece of wood has its own inherent form, as if already complete. Only then does one select and use it. "Setting the hand to it" means taking it up. Merging one’s own nature with the nature of the thing is called "merging heaven with heaven."

Dongye Ji was summoned by Duke Zhuang of Wei for his charioteering. His advances and retreats were as straight as a plumb line, his left and right turns as precise as a compass. The Duke thought even Wen’s skill could not surpass this and ordered him to circle a hundred times before returning. Yan He encountered him and, entering the court, said, "Ji’s horses are about to fail." The Duke remained silent, but soon enough, the horses faltered and returned. The Duke asked, "How did you know?" Yan He replied, "His horses’ strength was exhausted, yet he still demanded more—hence, failure."

The six reins were woven like a pattern, and his driving was as skillful as weaving—hence, "even Wen could not surpass this." "Circling" refers to driving the horses in a hunt. "A hundred turns" means a hundred circuits. When the horses’ strength is spent yet they are still driven relentlessly, even the most skilled charioteer will fail. How, then, can one overtax their spirit through self-exertion? This analogy is most apt and precise.

When Gongchui turned his hand, it was as if compass and square were already there. His fingers transformed with the object, without the mind lingering. Thus, his spirit was unified and unshackled. Here, the text digresses briefly.

Gongchui served as the craftsman for Gonggong, hence "Gongchui." "Turning" means rotating the hand to draw a circle. When Gongchui crafted vessels, his hand turned, and the circle was as perfect as if measured by compass and square. The *Kaogong Ji* states that the roundness of a vessel symbolizes heaven and earth. The cover is the roundest of objects, hence the analogy—though it does not mean the vessel itself was a cover. It is like Wu Daozi painting the halo of a Buddha: with a single stroke, it became a masterpiece, transcending skill. Here, too, the craft is divine. A vessel’s roundness requires no compass—only the hand draws it, yet the skill is sublime.

"Fingers" refer to the hand. "Transforming with the object" is like the saying in calligraphy: "The hand does not know the brush, the brush does not know the hand." Hand and object forget each other, the mind no longer lingering—this is what is meant by "the senses halt, the spirit moves." Hence, "without the mind lingering." "Lingering" means clinging.

Some ask, "If it is round, it conforms to the compass—why mention the square?" They do not realize that within roundness lies the square. A circle that does not conform to the square is not truly round. When craftsmen carve wood into a circle, they first make it square, revealing how compass and square are inseparable. Thus, it is said, "The compass gives rise to the square."

"Spirit terrace" refers to the mind. "Unified" means pure and undivided. "Unshackled" means unbound. Forgetting the feet is the comfort of shoes; forgetting the waist is the comfort of a belt. Forgetting right and wrong is the comfort of the mind. No inner change, no outer compliance—this is the comfort of meeting events. Beginning with comfort and never departing from it is the comfort of forgetting comfort.

"Comfort" means ease. The feet are at ease in shoes, the waist at ease in a belt—it is as if they are not there, hence "forgetting the feet, forgetting the waist." "Meeting" means encountering. Encountering the Dao and attaining ease, the inner realm becomes pure and unchanging. Though one engages with the external world, they no longer know what they are doing. "Beginning with comfort and never departing from it" means that over time, even the sense of comfort is forgotten. It is like putting on shoes: at first, one notices how well they fit, but after wearing them long enough, the initial sense of comfort fades—this is forgetting comfort. This illustrates human nature to elucidate the Dao. One must personally experience it to grasp how Zhuangzi exhausts the principles of things.

There was a man named Sun Xiu who came to the door and lamented to Bian Qingzi: "In my village, I am not seen as diligent; in times of crisis, I am not seen as brave. Yet when tilling the fields, I meet with poor harvests; when serving a lord, I meet with unworthy times. I am shunned by my village, driven from my district—what crime have I committed against heaven? Why must I suffer such fate?" Bianzi replied: "Have you never heard of the conduct of the perfected person? They forget their liver and gall, abandon their ears and eyes, wander aimlessly beyond the dust and grime, roam freely in the realm of no affairs. This is called acting without reliance, growing without domination. Now you adorn your knowledge to astonish the foolish, cultivate your conduct to expose others’ flaws, shining as brightly as if carrying the sun and moon. How can this be?"

"Yet you have preserved your whole form and body, retained all nine orifices, and—unlike those struck midway by deafness, blindness, lameness, or deformity—are counted among the ranks of men. This is already fortune enough. Why then spare time to resent heaven?

Be gone."

Sunzi departed. Bianzi entered, sat for a while, then looked up to the sky and sighed. His disciples asked, "Master, why do you sigh?"

Bianzi replied, "Just now, when Rest came, I spoke to him of the virtue of the perfected person. I fear he was startled and may fall into confusion."

The disciples said, "Not so. If Sunzi’s words were right and yours were wrong, then wrongness could not confuse rightness. If Sunzi’s words were wrong and yours were right, then he was already confused when he came—what fault is yours?"

Bianzi said, "Not so. Once, a bird alighted in the outskirts of Lu. The Lord of Lu delighted in it, prepared a grand feast to entertain it, and performed the *Nine Shao* to please it. The bird grew anxious, sorrowful, and dizzy, and dared neither eat nor drink. This is called nourishing a bird with what nourishes oneself. As for nourishing a bird as a bird ought to be nourished, one should let it roost in deep forests, float upon rivers and lakes, feed on whatever it finds, and rest on level ground—nothing more.

Now, Rest is a man of narrow vision and shallow learning. When I spoke to him of the virtue of the perfected person, it was like burdening a field mouse with chariots and horses, or delighting a sparrow with bells and drums. How could he not be startled?

*Banished by his village* means cast out by his village. *Exposing others’ flaws* means setting himself apart from vulgar customs. *Adorning knowledge to astonish the foolish, cultivating conduct to expose flaws*—this speaks of his deliberate pursuit of fame to distinguish himself. *Shining as brightly as if carrying the sun and moon*—this shows his desire for renown.

He was already confused when he came; his confusion was not of my making. What fault is mine?

*Narrow vision* refers to his limited perspective, like a small opening. *Shallow learning* means his knowledge is superficial. His understanding was already shallow, yet I spoke to him of lofty matters. How could he not be startled and fall into self-doubt? This is meant to satirize the scholars of our time, whose vision is narrow and who remain ignorant of the great Dao.

*Feeding it with whatever it finds* means allowing it to eat freely and at ease. *Whatever it finds* means self-sufficiency.

The parable of nourishing the bird has already appeared in the *Supreme Joy* chapter."

**Outer Chapters: The Mountain Trees**

When Master Zhuang was traveling through the mountains, he saw a great tree with luxuriant branches and leaves. A woodcutter stood beside it but did not fell it. Asking the reason, he was told, “It is of no use.” Master Zhuang said, “This tree, by being useless, has fulfilled its natural lifespan.”

Emerging from the mountains, he lodged at the home of an old friend. The friend, delighted, ordered his servant to kill a goose and cook it. The servant asked, “One can caw, the other cannot—which should we kill?” The host replied, “Kill the one that cannot caw.”

The next day, a disciple asked Master Zhuang, “Yesterday, the tree in the mountains, by being useless, fulfilled its natural lifespan, yet today the host’s goose, by being useless, was killed. Where should the Master stand?” Master Zhuang laughed and said, “I would stand between usefulness and uselessness. Yet even between usefulness and uselessness, one only *seems* to be free—thus one is not yet free from entanglement. But if one rides the Dao and floats upon virtue, it is otherwise: no praise, no blame, now a dragon, now a serpent, transforming with the times, never clinging to a single form. Rising and falling, one takes harmony as one’s measure, drifting upon the origin of the myriad things. Treating things as things yet not being treated as a thing by them—how then could one be entangled? This is the method of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor.

As for the passions of the myriad things and the traditions of human relationships, it is not so. Union leads to separation, completion to ruin, sharpness to blunting, honor to criticism, action to loss, worthiness to scheming, unworthiness to deceit—how can one be certain of anything? Alas! Remember this, my disciples: only in the realm of the Dao can one be secure.

That uselessness preserves one’s natural lifespan has been said many times before. Now, adding the case of the goose killed for its uselessness, another meaning emerges. For whether useful or useless, one still clings to form and trace, and thus remains entangled. Only when good and evil are both dissolved, when nothing can be named, is one’s natural wholeness preserved.

To *ride the Dao* is to follow nature. *Now a dragon, now a serpent*—like Dongfang Shuo’s saying: “When used, it is a tiger; when unused, a rat.” Whether employed or set aside, one follows the times without fixed intent, thus free from both slander and praise. To *cling to a single form* is to have intent; to *never cling* is to be without intent. *Rising and falling* means advancing and retreating. *Harmony* is compliance. *Measure* is standard, principle. Taking compliance with nature as one’s rule, whether rising or falling, all is acceptable. *The origin of the myriad things* is the beginning of all things. This is what Shennong and the Yellow Emperor could do—hence it is called *the method of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor.*

*The passions of the myriad things* refers to private desires. *Tradition* means custom. *The traditions of human relationships* are the inherited practices of humankind. The following lines exhaustively describe human nature: where there is union, there is separation—so it is said, “In this world, no feast lasts forever.” Where there is completion, there is ruin—“Were nothing ever abolished, how could a ruler rise?” One who exposes their edges will inevitably be blunted; one who stands above others will be criticized. One who acts with intent will suffer loss in reputation. People resent success and delight in failure, so the worthy must scheme for self-preservation—hence *worthiness leads to scheming.* The unworthy, fearing loss, will stop at nothing, resorting to deceit and treachery—hence *unworthiness leads to deceit.* In worldly affairs, one cannot be certain of anything—hence *how can one be certain?* *Alas!* laments the imperfection of the world, the impermanence of human affairs, the peril of hidden dangers. These words strike close to home, so I urge you, my disciples, to remember them well. Only by following nature can one avoid harm—hence *only in the realm of the Dao can one be secure.*

When Shinan Yiliao met the Lord of Lu, the lord wore a troubled expression. Shinan said, “My lord, why do you look troubled?” The Lord of Lu replied, “I study the Way of the former kings, uphold the legacy of my ancestors, revere the spirits and honor the worthy, practicing these without ceasing—yet I cannot escape misfortune. This is why I am troubled.”

Shinan said, “My lord’s method of avoiding misfortune is too shallow. The sleek fox and the patterned leopard dwell in the mountains and forests, crouch in caves and grottos, remaining still. They move by night and rest by day, ever vigilant. Though hungry and thirsty, they still keep their distance from the rivers and lakes, seeking food with caution. Yet they cannot escape the snares and traps—what crime have they committed? Their pelts bring them disaster. Is the state of Lu not your pelt?

I wish you would shear away your form, shed your pelt, cleanse your heart, and cast off desire, wandering in the wilds where no one dwells. *Residing thus*—calm and at ease. Here, the idea of *using or not using* leading to misfortune means that though one should have no cause for trouble, one still cannot escape it. *Hidden and constrained*—dwelling in seclusion, even when hungry and thirsty, one emerges to seek food by the rivers and lakes, yet still avoids others, keeping one’s distance. *Mutually*—as in the saying, ‘pecking sideways, looking all around, dwelling deep and venturing out little.’ To *be burdened by one’s pelt* means that having fame and position in the world only invites disaster. This truth cuts deep—only those deeply entangled in worldly affairs can understand it.

In the southern lands, there is a place called the State of Establishing Virtue. Its people are simple and unrefined, with few private desires. They know how to work but not how to hoard, give without seeking repayment, do not know where duty lies, nor where propriety leads. Wild and uninhibited, they tread the great Way. Their lives are joyful, their deaths are fitting. I wish you would abandon your state, cast off custom, and walk alongside the Dao.”

The preceding discourse on the "wilds without people" speaks of the origin before all things—here again named the State of Establishing Virtue. Reading this passage, one sees that today’s practice of "seeking rebirth in the Pure Land" traces its source to the Warring States era. The southern lands had yet to connect with the Central States, so the text borrows their name without other intent.

"Knowing how to work but not how to hoard" means tilling the land to feed oneself without private accumulation. Unburdened by the names of ritual and duty, they are said not to know where duty leads or where propriety goes. "Wild and uninhibited" describes following the heart’s desires, all of which accord with the Dao—thus "treading the great Way." "Walking alongside the Dao" means encouraging one another with a heart that admires the Way, aspiring to reach this land.

The lord said: "That Way is distant and perilous, with rivers and mountains in between. I have no boat or carriage—what can be done?"
Master Shinan replied: "Be without rigid form, without lingering attachment—let this be your carriage."
The lord said: "That Way is secluded and far, with no one there. Who would be my neighbor? I have no provisions, no food—how could I reach it?"
Master Shinan replied: "Reduce your expenses, lessen your desires—though you lack provisions, you will find sufficiency. Cross the river and float upon the sea; gaze as far as you can and see no shore, advance further and know no end. Those who see you off will all turn back from the shore—from then on, you will be far away.

"Without rigid form" means not clinging to one’s body. "Without lingering attachment" means not clinging to one’s state. If you can cultivate this mind, you may go—thus it is called your carriage. With no desires, nothing is lacking—thus, "reduce expenses, lessen desires, and though you lack provisions, you will find sufficiency." Crossing rivers and floating on the sea, gazing without seeing the shore, advancing without knowing the end—these three words, "advancing without end," are expounded here. "Those who see you off all turn back from the shore—from then on, you will be far away"—this line is most profound.

It speaks of those who study the Dao: once awakened, what once aided their enlightenment—like those who bid farewell and see one off to the sea’s edge—all return. Whether awakened by the sound of bamboo or the rolling up of a blind, these are but the senders. Like one who sees swordplay and masters calligraphy, the sword was the means at first, but once awakened, the sword becomes the sender. Even reading books serves as a sender.

Thus, to possess others is a burden; to be possessed by others is sorrow. Therefore, Yao neither possessed others nor was possessed by them. I wish to free you from your burdens, remove your sorrows, and wander alone with the Dao in the boundless land.

When two boats cross a river side by side, if an empty boat drifts and strikes them, even a hot-tempered person would not grow angry. But if there were someone aboard, one would shout to make them push away—if the first call goes unheard, a second, and then a third, anger would surely follow with harsh words. Before, there was no anger, but now there is; before, the boat was empty, now it is full. If one can empty oneself and wander through the world, who could harm them?

"Possessing others" means using the self to control things. "Being possessed by others" means being controlled by things. Neither accords with the natural Way. Yao neither used the self to control things nor was controlled by them—thus it is said he neither possessed others nor was possessed by them.

The "boundless land" is the vast emptiness of the Great Void—the same as the "wilds without people" and the State of Establishing Virtue. This concludes the preceding chapter, its meaning now complete, followed by an analogy.

"Two boats side by side" refers to paired vessels. If my boat is underway and struck by an empty one, since the boat is empty, I would not grow angry. But if someone were suddenly aboard the empty boat, I would call out to make them push away. If my first call goes unheard, then a second, and by the third, I would surely curse. No one means emptiness; someone means fullness. Before, with no one, there was no anger—now, with someone, anger arises. Such is human nature. This analogy is excellent.

It means: if I am without intent, I will not clash with things. Wandering through this world with an empty heart, what harm could there be?

After this long discourse, the analogy brings it to a close—this is the method of structuring a text from beginning to end. *Liezi* contains a similar passage:

When Beigong She levied taxes for Duke Ling of Wei to cast bells, he built an altar outside the city gates and completed the upper and lower chime racks in three months. Wang’s Qing Ji saw this and asked: "What technique did you employ?"
She replied: "In the midst of purity, I dared not impose anything. I have heard that once carving and polishing are done, one returns to simplicity. Unknowing and carefree, drifting in boundless uncertainty, I sent off the departing and welcomed the arriving—letting newcomers come without restraint, letting the departing go without hindrance, following their strength, adapting to their shapes, and letting them reach their own ends. Thus, though I levied taxes day and night, not a hair was harmed—how much more so for those on the great path?"

Levying the people’s wealth to cast bells, he first made offerings before smelting—thus "building an altar and completing it in three months." Bells have frames to hang them, and the frames have two tiers—hence "upper and lower racks," referring to the chime arrangement.

"What technique did you employ?" means: what method allowed such speed? "Purity" means undivided. Following the principle of nature, maintaining purity from beginning to end without interference—thus "in the midst of purity, I dared not impose anything." It is like saying nothing else could be inserted here.

"Once carving and polishing are done, one returns to simplicity" means shedding sharp edges to return to nature.

How vacant and unknowing in appearance! How hesitant and doubtful, as if without any intent or purpose! Some come, some go—neither leading nor welcoming—hence "gathered yet scattered." "Gathered" suggests a solid mass; "scattered," the absence of form. Let those who come not be barred, and those who go not be detained—this means following their natural course without welcoming or sending off. Those who depart in defiance and refuse to comply are crooked and cling stubbornly; those who turn back and attach themselves to me, I follow and heed, allowing them to be as they are. "Self-exhausting" means self-arriving. Whether compliant or resistant, in the end, none seek yet all arrive of themselves—thus "following their self-exhaustion." Though I levy taxes, not a hair of the people is harmed—hence "not a hair was harmed." Those on the great path proceed smoothly and openly; simply approach it with a mind free of intent, and all is swiftly accomplished.

When Confucius was besieged between Chen and Cai, he went seven days without cooked food. Taigong Ren went to console him, saying: "You nearly died, did you not?" "Indeed," replied Confucius. "Do you detest death?" "Indeed." Ren said: "Let me speak to you of the way of not dying. In the Eastern Sea there is a bird called the *yidai*. As a bird, it is slow and sluggish, appearing incapable. It takes flight only with the aid of others, and perches only when pressed. It does not dare to lead in advancing nor to lag in retreating. It does not dare to be the first to eat, but must take the leavings. Thus, though it flies in formation, it is not driven away, and outsiders never harm it—so it avoids disaster. The straightest trees are felled first; the sweetest wells run dry first. You, with your intent to adorn knowledge to startle the ignorant, cultivate yourself to expose others’ flaws, and shine forth as if carrying the sun and moon in your stride—how could you escape harm? Long ago, I heard a man of great attainment say: 'Those who boast of themselves achieve no merit; those who take pride in their achievements ruin their names. Success is already a loss—who can relinquish merit and fame and return to the common fold? The Dao flows yet does not shine; dwelling in attainment, it does not claim a place. Pure and constant, it resembles madness. Erasing traces and relinquishing power, it does not pursue merit or fame—thus it bears no blame from others, and others bear none from it. The perfected person remains unknown—why do you delight in fame?'"

Confucius said: "Well said!" He then parted ways with his acquaintances, dismissed his disciples, and fled to the great marsh. He wore coarse furs and ate wild fruits, moving among beasts without disrupting their herds, among birds without disturbing their flocks. Neither beasts nor birds shunned him—how much more so for people!

"Do you detest death?"—this means: in this dire strait of mortal peril, does your heart also loathe it? "The way of not dying" refers to self-contentment free from disaster. The *yidai* is today’s swallow. "Slow and sluggish" describes its flight. "Taking flight with the aid of others" means flying in flocks. "Perching when pressed" means nesting near humans. "Not daring to lead in advancing nor to lag in retreating" means it does not contend in coming and going. "Leavings" are what others discard—it eats insects and the scraps of the world. "Not driven away" means not being numerous. Though it flies in formation, it does not gather in great numbers like crows or geese; each relies on human dwellings, and outsiders do not harm it. The straight tree and sweet well are metaphors for those who make themselves known through reputation.

The "man of great attainment" is a scholar of the great Dao. Those who boast of themselves cannot succeed; those who delight in merit and fame ultimately bring ruin upon themselves—all is self-inflicted harm. "Return to the common fold" means withdrawing to be as others. Proceeding in accord with the Dao, one remains obscure and self-effacing—hence "the Dao flows yet does not shine." Though one dwells in a time when one’s will may be fulfilled, one does not exalt oneself through reputation—hence "dwelling in attainment, it does not claim a place." "Not claiming" means not possessing. "Pure and constant" means unity. "Resembling madness" means appearing without intent. "Erasing traces and relinquishing power" means not pursuing merit or fame—this implies transformation without leaving a mark. I do not blame others, and others forget me—this is the perfected person. The perfected person desires no renown in the world. Why then do you delight in fame?

The final passage echoes the sentiment of "eating pork as if it were human flesh." Here, the name of Confucius is borrowed to expound the teaching—this is emphatic repetition.

Confucius asked Zisang Hu: "I was twice exiled from Lu, had a tree felled upon me in Song, erased my traces in Wei, was impoverished in Shang and Zhou, and besieged between Chen and Cai. I have endured these many hardships—my close associates have grown more distant, and my disciples and friends have scattered. What is the reason for this?" Zisang Hu replied: "Have you not heard of the man of Jia who fled? Lin Hui abandoned a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces and carried a baby on his back as he fled. Someone said: 'Was it for the sake of money? The baby is of little worth. Was it for the sake of burden? The baby is a great encumbrance. Why abandon a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces and carry a baby on your back as you flee?' Lin Hui said: 'That was bound by profit; this is bound by Heaven. Those bound by profit, when pressed by poverty, disaster, or harm, abandon one another; those bound by Heaven, when pressed by poverty, disaster, or harm, draw closer together. The difference between drawing closer and abandoning is vast. Moreover, the friendship of the noble is as bland as water; the friendship of the petty is as sweet as wine. The noble are bland yet intimate; the petty are sweet yet easily severed. Those who unite without cause will part without cause.'"

Confucius said: "I respectfully receive your instruction." He then walked slowly and leisurely back, abandoned his learning, discarded his books, and his disciples no longer vied for his attention—yet their affection for him grew even deeper.

Zisang Hu—*Hu* means "door." "The man of Jia" refers to a man from the state of Jia. The metaphor of abandoning jade to carry a child is most apt. Those bound by Heaven always draw together; those bound by profit always abandon one another. The friendship of the noble is bland yet intimate; the friendship of the petty is sweet yet easily severed—this perfectly captures the ways of the world. Though these words appear in the *Analects* and *Mencius*, they are fitting here.

"Those who unite without cause will part without cause—this is clearly seen in the *Mang* poem. This single line forms another fine thread of coherence.

'His disciples no longer vied for his attention'—unrestrained by immediate concerns. *Yi* refers to the ritual of bowing. Yet their affection for him grew even deeper.

Later, Zisang Hu said: As Shun was about to die, he truly admonished Yu, saying: 'Be ever vigilant! In form, follow the natural course; in feeling, follow the natural impulse. Following the natural course ensures no separation; following the natural impulse ensures no toil. Without separation or toil, one does not seek adornment to await the form; without seeking adornment to await the form, one fundamentally does not depend on external things.'

*Ling* is pronounced *ling*, meaning 'to enlighten.' Shun spoke to Yu with the true and unadorned Dao, hence 'truly admonished.' *Yuan* means to follow its natural state; *shuai*, to comply with its natural tendency. 'No separation' means to become one with the Dao. 'Form' refers to the self. 'Adornment' refers to things external to the body. 'Not seeking adornment to await the form' means not relying on external things to sustain the self—hence 'fundamentally does not depend on external things.' Today, when people entertain guests, they say 'to await guests'—this is the sense of the first *dai*. Not treating externals as adornment means having no need for things—hence 'fundamentally does not depend on things.' The second *dai* here carries the sense of 'not relying on.' The three instances of *dai* thus divide into two distinct meanings.

Zhuangzi wore coarse cloth patched with rags, tied his shoes with twisted hemp, and passed by the King of Wei. The king said: 'Why is the Master so weary?' Zhuangzi replied: 'It is poverty, not weariness. When a scholar possesses the Dao and virtue yet cannot put them into practice, that is weariness. Worn clothes and tattered shoes are poverty, not weariness—this is what it means to be out of step with the times.'

'Have you not seen the leaping monkeys? When they find themselves among nanmu, catalpa, and camphor trees, they grasp the vines, swing through the branches, and reign as kings among them—even Yi or Feng Meng could not take aim at them. Yet when they find themselves among thorny brambles, prickly ash, and wolfthorn, they move cautiously, glance about in fear, and tremble with dread. It is not that their sinews and bones have suddenly stiffened and lost their suppleness, but that their circumstances are unfavorable, leaving them unable to display their abilities. Now, dwelling among dark rulers and chaotic ministers, how can one avoid weariness? This is comparable to the case of Gan, whose heart was cut out as proof.'"

Cloth of coarse hemp is but a rough fabric. *Hui* refers to a sash; a proper sash is tied at the waist. To "bind the shoes" means to thread them with cord when they are worn out. *Bei* signifies illness. *Lan* means to grasp; *man*, to entwine—these two words depict the monkey in the trees, naturally and without carelessness. "Reigning as king" expresses the fullness of its ambition and the satisfaction of its will. *Zhe*, *ji*, *zhi*, and *gou* are all thorn-bearing trees. "Trembling" denotes fear. The phrase "not supple" with the addition of "stiffened" is particularly apt. Medical texts describe a condition of stiffened neck and nape—this is stiffness without suppleness, and it vividly captures the monkey’s state.

"As proof" means that, by comparing this to the case of Bi Gan, one sees its verification. These three characters are also striking.

When Confucius was stranded between Chen and Cai, he went seven days without cooked food. Leaning against a withered tree with his left hand and striking its withered branches with his right, he sang the airs of the *Yan* clan. There was the form but not the measure, the sound but not the tones of gong or jue. The sound of wood and the sound of man—neither held constancy in the human heart. Yan Hui stood upright, hands folded, and turned his gaze to observe. Fearing that Hui would exalt him and thus advance too far, or cherish him and thus fall into sorrow, Confucius said: "Hui, to refuse what harms a man is easy; to refuse what benefits him is difficult. There is no beginning that is not also an end—man and Heaven are one."

"Now, who is it that sings?" The "withered tree" is a stand; the "withered branches" are staffs—what the *Qi Wu* chapter calls *ce ji*. Since he strikes withered staffs against a withered stand, it is said there is the form. Though he strikes, there is no rhythm, so it is said there is no measure. "No gong or shang" means it does not conform to the five notes. The sound of wood is that of the striker; the sound of man, that of the singer. The meaning is clear and precise.

"Exalting me" means honoring me. If one seeks it with the intent to honor me, what is attained will have no bounds—hence the fear that he would "exalt me and advance too far." If one reflects on it with affection for me, it will inevitably lead to sorrow—hence the fear that he would "cherish me and fall into sorrow." *Zao* is read as *cuo*.

"Man and Heaven are one" means that all within me is Heaven’s principle. The singer now is not myself—hence the question, "Who is it?"

Hui said: "May I ask why refusing what Heaven harms is easy?"
Confucius replied: "Hunger, thirst, cold, heat, and confinement that cannot be escaped—these are the movements of Heaven and Earth, the unfolding of the workings of things. To move with them is what is meant by 'going along.' As a minister, one does not dare to depart from them; holding to the Way of the minister is already thus—how much more so in awaiting Heaven’s decree."

"What is meant by refusing what benefits a man being difficult?"
Confucius replied: "At the first flourishing of one’s use, ranks and emoluments arrive together, yet one does not pursue the profit of things—this is not of oneself, for my fate lies beyond. The noble man does not act as a thief; the worthy does not act as a pilferer. If I were to take these, what would I be doing? Thus it is said: No bird is wiser than the swallow. Where its eyes deem it unsuitable to dwell, it does not even glance—though fruit should fall, it abandons it and flees. Its fear of man leads it to nest among men. Yet the altars of soil and grain endure."

"What is meant by 'no beginning that is not also an end'?"
Confucius replied: "Transforming the myriad things without knowing who effects the succession—how can one know its end? How can one know its beginning? One simply awaits it uprightly."

"What is meant by 'man and Heaven are one'?"
Confucius replied: "There is man, and there is Heaven; yet Heaven is also Heaven. That man cannot possess Heaven is his nature. The sage, at ease, embodies passing away and thus comes to an end."

"Heaven’s harm" refers to times of hardship. "Refusing" means to remain joyful in poverty. "Man’s benefit" refers to wealth and honor. "Refusing" means to remain uncorrupted by wealth and honor. Common opinion holds that to remain uncorrupted by wealth and honor is easy, while to remain joyful in poverty is difficult. Yet Zhuangzi reverses this, and it is profoundly meaningful.

In times of Heaven’s harm, affairs are not within one’s control. Though one may wish to refuse, how can one not accept? One cannot but endure poverty—hence it is said to be easy. As for man’s benefit, when wealth arrives daily and rank rises ever higher, increasing month by month, I may wish to decline but cannot. Thus nobility does not await arrogance to become arrogant; wealth does not await extravagance to become extravagant—hence it is said that refusing is difficult.

"Confinement" means blockage; "cannot be escaped" means it cannot be pushed away. "The workings of things" refers to the movements of qi; "unfolding" means their expression. The coming and going of the workings of things is Heaven. I move with them and express them together—hence "going along." This is what is meant by "moving with the times" and "reaching the limit with the times." One cannot disobey the command of one’s lord—how much less can one disobey Heaven’s decree? This is the meaning of "refusing what Heaven harms is easy."

"Flourishing in all directions" means that one’s intentions encounter no obstruction. "First use" means that as soon as this intention arises, affairs follow and gather without obstruction—arriving together without exhaustion, converging without cease. I do not seek the profit of things, yet profit comes of itself—hence "not of oneself." Ranks and emoluments all come from without; such is the decree of the times. Thus it is said, "my fate lies beyond." To receive emolument without merit is a shame to the noble man; he regards it as theft or pilfering. Though I may wish not to take it, there is that which cannot be pushed away. When Gongsun He was appointed minister, he wept—was this not the difficulty of refusing man’s benefit?

The *yiyi* is the swallow. "Does not even glance" means it deems it unworthy of sight. Where it is not suitable to dwell, though its eyes may see, it considers it unworthy of sight and departs. When fruit falls, it must flee in fear of harming itself—hence "abandons it and flees." Though its will is to avoid man, it nonetheless dwells near man—hence "nests among men." *Xi* means to enter.

The altars of soil and grain are places of sacrifice; though they inspire no fear, neither do they offer anything to take. People revere and preserve them of their own accord, just as the swallow dwells in human homes—though it brings no benefit, neither does it cause harm, and so people tolerate its presence. This is to say, if one in wealth and honor could be like the swallow, neither benefiting nor harming, then none would reproach or despise him. Yet once called wealthy and honored, how can one remain without benefit or harm? Hence it is said to be difficult.

That which has no beginning yet will have no end means one knows neither its start nor its finish. The transformations of the ten thousand things succeed one another in turn—who knows their end, who knows their beginning? One can only abide in the midst and await them. "Right" means the center, referring to dwelling within the workings of creation.

What is meant by "man and Heaven are one"? Man is born of Heaven, thus it is said, "there is man"—this is Heaven. Heaven, too, is made by the workings of creation, thus it is said, "there is Heaven"—this is also Heaven. Nature is the nature mandated by Heaven; this character *xing* (nature) is the same as *sheng* (life). The nature within man, that which is possessed from birth, is all received from Heaven—how could man claim it as his own? The sage knows only what man cannot possess, and so abides in it with ease, exhausting only his own body.

Mencius said, "This nature has its mandate." The noble man does not call it nature—this is to say, man cannot possess Heaven’s nature. "At ease" means composed. Abiding in due time and following the natural course to the end of one’s days, thus it is said, "embodying transience, one comes to an end."

Zhuang Zhou wandered within the fence of Carved Mound and saw an unusual magpie coming from the south. Its wings spanned seven feet, its eyes measured an inch in circumference. It brushed past Zhuang Zhou’s forehead and alighted in the chestnut grove. Zhuang Zhou said, "What bird is this? Its wings are vast yet it does not fly, its eyes are large yet it does not see." He hitched up his robe, strode forward, took up his sling, and waited. He saw a cicada that had just found a fine shade and forgotten itself; a mantis seized the opportunity to strike, seeing only its gain and forgetting its form. The strange magpie then took advantage of the mantis, seeing only profit and forgetting its true nature. Zhuang Zhou started and said, "Alas! Things indeed entangle one another—two kinds summon each other." He cast aside his sling and turned to flee, but the gamekeeper pursued and berated him.

Zhuang Zhou returned home and for three months did not leave his courtyard. Jian Qie followed and asked him, "Master, why have you not left your courtyard of late?" Zhuang Zhou said, "I guarded my form yet forgot my person, gazing upon turbid waters and becoming lost in the clear abyss. Moreover, I have heard from the Master that when entering a custom, one follows its ways. Today I wandered in Carved Mound and forgot myself; the strange magpie brushed my forehead, and I wandered in the chestnut grove, forgetting my true nature. The gamekeeper of the chestnut grove took me for a thief—this is why I have not left my courtyard."

Carved Mound is a place name. *Fan* refers to the fence of a garden. "Brushed past Zhuang Zhou’s forehead" means it flew past before his brow. *Yin* means great. *Shi* means to go. Its wings were large yet it could not fly; its eyes were large yet it could not see—this is the state of one who pursues things and becomes lost. "Took up his sling and waited" means he intended to capture it. The mantis, seizing the cicada, sought only gain and forgot its form; the strange magpie, coveting the mantis, forgot its true nature—hence its inability to fly or see. Mantis and magpie, though of different kinds, summoned each other, both forgetting their form and their true nature, thus entangling one another. The *yuren* is the keeper of the garden. *Sui* means to scold. "Did not leave his courtyard" means he did not go out into his courtyard.

"Guarding the form" refers to one who nurtures life. I, studying the nurturing of life, suddenly forgot myself in pursuit of the magpie—this is to be led astray by desire and muddy one’s principles. Turbid waters are a metaphor for human desire; the clear abyss, for Heavenly principle. The Master is Laozi. "When entering a state, inquire about its customs"—this means to ask about its prohibitions. To enter another’s garden by mistake is to violate the prohibition. "Took me for a thief" means he was humiliated by the gamekeeper. This passage illustrates that in things, great or small, wherever there is pursuit, there is delusion. These are words for the scholar’s use.

Yangzi traveled to Song and lodged at an inn. The innkeeper had two concubines: one beautiful, the other plain. The plain one was honored, while the beautiful one was slighted. Yangzi asked the reason, and the innkeeper’s servant replied, "The beautiful one is beautiful in her own eyes; I do not see her beauty. The plain one is plain in her own eyes; I do not see her plainness." Yangzi said, "Disciples, take note: act with virtue yet discard the conduct of self-regard—where could you go and not be loved?"

"The beautiful one is beautiful in her own eyes" means she is self-conceited. "The plain one is plain in her own eyes" means she humbly considers herself inadequate. "Act with virtue yet discard the conduct of self-regard" means to possess the virtue of the worthy without the conduct of self-importance—then wherever one goes, people will cherish and delight in him. This passage, too, is an intimate lesson for the scholar’s use.

Reading these several chapters, some deem the Outer Chapters not to be the work of Zhuangzi—could this truly be so?

*The True Classic of Southern Florescence, Proper Meaning, Scroll Twenty-One, Ends Here.*

**The True Classic of Southern Florescence, Oral Explications, Scroll Twenty-Two**

*By Lin Xiang of Yuanzhai*

**Outer Chapters: "Tian Zifang"**

Tian Zifang was in attendance upon Marquis Wen of Wei. He repeatedly praised Xi Gong, whereupon the Marquis said, "Is Xi Gong your teacher?"

Zifang replied, "No. He is but a fellow villager of Wuze. His praises of the Way were timely and apt, so Wuze commended him."

The Marquis said, "Then have you no teacher?"

Zifang said, "I do."

The Marquis asked, "Who is your teacher?"

Zifang said, "Dongguo Shunzi."

The Marquis said, "Then why have you never spoken of him?"

Zifang said, "His person is true: in human form yet of Heaven, empty and compliant yet preserving the real, pure yet accommodating all things. When others act without the Way, he corrects his bearing to awaken them, dissolving their misguided intentions. How could Wuze be worthy to speak of him?"

Zifang departed. The Marquis, lost in thought, remained silent the rest of the day. Summoning the ministers who stood before him, he said, "How distant is the gentleman of perfect virtue! At first, I took the words of sagely wisdom and the conduct of benevolence and righteousness to be the ultimate. But upon hearing of Zifang’s teacher, my form dissolved and I had no desire to move; my mouth was sealed and I had no desire to speak. What I have learned is but a clay effigy. Truly, Wei has become a burden to me."

*Timely and apt in praising the Way* means his recitations of principle were all fitting. *His person is true* means he is pure. *In human form yet of Heaven* means that though his appearance is human, he possesses the natural virtue of Heaven. *Empty and compliant* means he never stirs his heart, thus *preserving the real*. *Pure* means self-purified. Being pure, he readily disengages from things yet can accommodate them—this speaks to his greatness. When others act contrary to the Way, he never reproaches them with words but merely adjusts his bearing to make them self-aware, naturally dissolving their unworthy intentions. Hence, *dissolving their misguided intentions*. Xi Gong’s goodness could still be described, but Shunzi’s excellence cannot be put into words. Thus, *how could Wuze be worthy to speak of him*. *The gentleman of perfect virtue* refers to Shunzi. *Form dissolved* means self-lost. *Clay effigy* means grasping the coarse but not the refined. Taking possession of a state as a burden, one cannot deeply investigate the Way of non-action and spontaneity. Thus, *truly, Wei has become a burden to me*.

When Wenbo Xuezi journeyed to Qi, he lodged in Lu. A man of Lu requested an audience, but Wenbo Xuezi said, "I cannot. I have heard that the gentlemen of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and righteousness but coarse in understanding the human heart. I do not wish to meet them."

Upon reaching Qi, he returned and lodged again in Lu. The same man again requested an audience. Wenbo Xuezi said, "Formerly he sought to see me, and now he seeks to see me again—he must have some way to rouse me."

He went out to meet the guest, then returned and sighed. The next day, he met the guest again and returned, sighing once more. His servant said, "Each time you meet this guest, you return and sigh. Why?"

He said, "I already told you: the people of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and righteousness but coarse in understanding the human heart. The one who saw me before advanced and retreated as if bound by compass and square, moved with the composure of a dragon or a tiger. His admonitions were like those of a son; his guidance, like that of a father. That is why I sighed."

Confucius saw him but did not speak. Zilu said, "Master, you have long wished to see Wenbo Xuezi. Now that you have seen him, why do you not speak?"

Confucius said, "In such a man, the Way is present at a glance. It cannot be contained in sound."

*Bo* is his given name.

Wenbo Xuezi—*Xuezi* is his courtesy name.

Ritual and righteousness are teachings of deliberate action. To be "coarse in understanding the human heart" means to be deficient, for it signifies a failure to recognize the fundamental mind. "To invigorate" is to invigorate one’s virtue; it means his words must benefit me, hence "he invigorates me." "Advancing and retreating as if bound by compass and square, moving with the composure of a dragon or a tiger"—this describes his demeanor and conduct as perfectly aligned with ritual. "Compass and square" denote regulated standards; "dragon and tiger," the embodiment of refined patterns. This is what is meant by "the great man’s transformation like a tiger."

"His admonitions were like those of a son; his guidance, like that of a father"—this refers to speaking profoundly despite a shallow acquaintance. "The Way is present at a glance" means that through proper bearing alone, one awakens, causing the other’s intent to dissipate. "Contained in sound" refers to verbal expression.

Yan Yuan asked Confucius, "When the Master walks, I walk; when the Master hastens, I hasten; when the Master gallops, I gallop. Yet when the Master races ahead, leaving all dust behind, I can only stare blankly in his wake."

Confucius said, "Yan, what do you mean?"

"When the Master walks, I walk; when the Master speaks, I speak; when the Master hastens, I hasten; when the Master debates, I debate; when the Master gallops, I gallop; when the Master speaks of the Way, I too speak of the Way. Yet when he races ahead, leaving all dust behind, I can only stare blankly in his wake—why is this?"

Confucius said, "Alas! Should this not be examined? There is no sorrow greater than the death of the heart, and the death of the body is secondary to it. The sun rises in the east and sets in the westernmost reaches; all things align themselves accordingly. Those with eyes and limbs depend on it to accomplish their tasks. When it emerges, they thrive; when it withdraws, they perish. All things are likewise. There is that upon which they depend in death, and that upon which they depend in life.

I, having received my completed form, do not alter it while awaiting its end. I move in imitation of things, acting day and night without pause, yet I do not know where it will end. Harmoniously, my form is complete, yet even knowing fate, I cannot regulate what lies before me. I, Qiu, daily decline in this way. To spend my entire life at your side, only to lose grasp of it in an instant—how can this not be sorrowful? You are likely fixated on what I am fixated upon. That has already reached its end, yet you seek it as if it still exists—this is like searching for a horse in an empty market stall. What I practice in you is profoundly forgotten; what you practice in me is likewise profoundly forgotten. Yet why should you be troubled? Though you may forget my former self, there remains that which I do not forget."

"Not relying on close association yet achieving perfect harmony"—this means that without depending on intimate familiarity, his nature is naturally complete and beautiful. "Without instruments" refers to the impossibility of tracing or naming it. "The people tread before him"—this means they come of their own accord, which illustrates the Master’s unattainability. "Not knowing how it is so"—this means I have reached a point where I no longer understand how it comes to be.

"Racing ahead" means swift flight. "Leaving all dust behind" means moving so quickly that no dust is seen. "Staring blankly" means gazing with fixed eyes. "Walking, hastening, galloping"—all are metaphors drawn from horses. "Should this not be examined?" means one must scrutinize this further. "The death of the heart" means having nothing to perceive. To live without perception is worse than death, hence "there is no sorrow greater than the death of the heart, and the death of the body is secondary to it."

"Alignment" means being measurable. When the sun is bright, the length and size of all things can be fully discerned, hence "all things align themselves accordingly." Rising in the east and setting in the west spans from dawn to dusk. "Those with eyes and limbs" refers to all living creatures. They must see the sun before their tasks can be accomplished; "depending on it" means depending on the sun, hence "they depend on it to accomplish their tasks." "When it emerges, they thrive; when it withdraws, they perish"—the flourishing and decline of human affairs are tied to the sun’s rising and setting, as in "rising at sunrise and resting at sunset." All things’ dependence on the Way is like human affairs’ dependence on the sun, hence "all things are likewise."

"Life and death both follow the natural course of the Way," hence "there is that upon which they depend in death, and that upon which they depend in life." Once born and having received one’s form, this Way resides within the body, unchanging while awaiting its end, hence "do not alter it while awaiting its end." "Not altering" means remaining without change. "Imitating" means following. Acting in imitation of things leaves no room for personal intent, hence "moving in imitation of things." "Things" refers to external phenomena. "Without pause" means without interruption. "Not knowing its end" means having no limit.

"Harmoniously, this body is nothing but the principle of compliance," hence "harmoniously, my form is complete." "Harmoniously" means in accord. Though one may know that all things are fated, in daily practice one does not use fate as a measure—this is what is meant by "the sage does not speak of fate." "Daily decline" means being thus every day, advancing together with it in unceasing purity. "Exchanging an arm’s length" means standing side by side. To spend one’s entire life in your company yet fail to grasp this Way is what is meant by "exchanging an arm’s length yet losing it."

"Fixated" means what is visible. You see only what is visible in me and do not recognize what is invisible, hence "you are likely fixated on what I am fixated upon." "Exhausted" means nothingness. The Way must reach nothingness before it is complete; you seek it as if it exists, which is why you cannot perceive its completion, hence "that has already reached its end, yet you seek it as if it exists." A *si* is a place where horses are traded. *Tang* refers to a roofless structure. The *Book of Songs* says, "In the central hall there are bricks." A *tangsi* is like today’s roadside pavilion. Those who trade horses come and go unpredictably; to seek one by stopping at its stall is like marking the boat to find a sunken sword.

"Forgotten" means what cannot be known. "Profoundly forgotten" means utterly unknowable. "Practicing" means acting. What I practice in you is utterly unknowable; what you practice in me must likewise be utterly unknowable, hence "what I practice in you is profoundly forgotten; what you practice in me is likewise profoundly forgotten."

This means that this matter cannot be spoken of between you and me—you cannot speak of it to me, nor can I to you—it is only when words are forgotten that its fullness is attained.

Yet there is another turn. Though you may not yet have reached this point, what cause is there for concern? For since you already know that those who gallop ahead, leaving all dust behind, can only stare in bewilderment from afar, you thereby recognize that there remains an unexhausted understanding. If you can reach the point of forgetting your former self, though what you perceive now may differ from before, what remains unforgotten within me endures as it was. This is what the Buddhists mean when they say, "After awakening, one is still the same person as before"—it is to see that only when one reaches the realm of no-place does fullness arise, yet this is still the principle of sometimes-existing. Thus it is said: though the former self is forgotten, there remains something in me that is not forgotten.

These two instances of "me" refer to Yan Hui himself, differing from the earlier "what I practice in you" and "what you practice in me."

When Confucius visited Lao Dan, Lao Dan had just washed his hair and was letting it dry, unbound. He stood motionless, like a wooden figure. Confucius withdrew and waited. After a while, he approached and said: "Was I deluded just now? Truly, was it so? Earlier, Master, your form appeared stiff as a withered tree, as if you had abandoned all things and departed from humankind, standing alone beyond the world."

Lao Dan said: "I let my mind wander in the beginning of things."

Confucius said: "What do you mean?"

Lao Dan replied: "The mind is confounded and cannot know; the mouth shuts and cannot speak. I have tried to describe for you something akin to it. In the depths of yin, there is solemn stillness; in the heights of yang, there is blazing brilliance. The solemn stillness emerges from Heaven; the blazing brilliance arises from Earth. When the two intermingle, harmony is born, and all things come into being. Some pattern governs this, yet its form is unseen. It waxes and wanes, fills and empties, now dark, now bright. Day by day it transforms, month by month it changes, daily it acts yet no one sees its work. Life has its sprouting, death has its return. Beginning and end turn back upon themselves without origin, and none know where it ends.

If not this, then what else could be its source?"

Letting his hair loose to dry was what *Li Sao* calls "longing for unbound hair." *Zhiran* describes a state of concentrated stillness. "Not human" means like a wooden puppet. *Jue* means stiff and motionless. "Abandoning things" means leaving external objects behind. "Departing from humankind" means separating from human concerns. "Standing alone" means rising above the world.

"The beginning of things" refers to the origin before things existed. *Pi* means closed. With the mind knowing nothing and the mouth unwilling to speak, it is said to be "confounded" and "closed." *Jiang* means near. Since the profound mystery is difficult to express, one can only approximate its nearness, hence "describe something akin to it." Earlier it was said "its fence, its wind," here it is "something akin," a shift in phrasing.

*Susu* conveys the sense of severe cold. *Hehe* conveys radiant brightness. This is what is meant by "the Dao is the alternation of yin and yang." The next four lines state that only when yin and yang harmonize do the myriad things come to be. *Jiaotong* means mutual interaction. Yin alone cannot generate, yang alone cannot complete, thus "intermingling brings harmony."

*Ji* means the guiding principle, the governing force. It is as if something governs yet remains invisible, hence "some pattern governs this, yet its form is unseen." What governs this is the work of creation. "Now dark, now bright" refers to day and night. "Waxing and waning, filling and emptying" describe the movement of qi through the four seasons. "Day by day it transforms, month by month it changes" means each day differs from the last, each month from the one before. "Daily it acts yet no one sees its work" means that though it operates every day, the work of creation cannot be named or described.

"Turning back" means differing. Though beginning and end differ, their origin cannot be traced. For example, when a sparrow transforms into a clam, if we say the sparrow’s end is the clam’s beginning, then the clam’s beginning is the sparrow’s end. Even in the grand succession of emperors, it is the same: how can one see its end? Thus it is said, "Beginning and end turn back upon themselves without origin, and none know where it ends."

This clearly describes the Creator, yet without naming it, it then asks, "If not this, then what else could be its source?" *Zong* also means the Creator. It is to say, if not this, then what governs and sustains all?

Zhuangzi’s writing is alive in every line—this is one such instance.

Confucius said: "May I ask about wandering in this?"

Lao Dan said: "To attain this is to reach the utmost beauty and joy. One who attains the utmost beauty and wanders in the utmost joy is called a perfected person."

Confucius said: "I would like to hear the method."

Lao Dan replied: "Beasts that graze do not resent changing marshes; creatures of the water do not resent changing streams. They undergo small changes but do not lose their great constancy. Joy and anger, sorrow and happiness do not enter their hearts.

Now, the world is the unity of the myriad things. If you attain this unity and become the same as it, then your four limbs and hundred parts will be but dust and grime, and life and death, beginning and end will be like day and night—nothing can disturb them, much less the mere trifles of gain and loss, fortune and misfortune.

Those who cast off servitude do so as if discarding mud and mire, knowing that the self is nobler than servitude. What is noble resides within me and does not lose itself to change. Moreover, the myriad transformations have no end—how could they trouble the heart? Those who have attained the Dao understand this."

"Utmost beauty and utmost joy" praise the beauty of the Dao. "Do not resent" means do not grow weary. "Small changes" refers to changing marshes and streams, yet they do not lose their great constancy—what they eat and drink remains the same.

All living things exist under Heaven, so they must follow Heaven’s workings. How can they set themselves apart? Thus it is said, "The world is the unity of the myriad things." Knowing that this unity arises from Heaven and is no different from it, then not even life and death can disturb the heart—how much less gain and loss, fortune and misfortune?

*Jie* means a trifling obstacle. *Li* means servants.

Servants come and go, discarded like mud and mire—because I deem myself noble and them base. Yet if one understands that the true value of the Dao lies within oneself, how could external changes ever strip away one’s utmost beauty and joy? Between Heaven and Earth, transformations follow one another endlessly, as they have for all eternity—when will they ever cease? Gain and loss, fortune and misfortune are nothing but the workings of nature; how could they trouble the heart? Thus it is said, "The myriad transformations have no end—how could they trouble the heart?"

Yet the common world cannot grasp this; only those whose self and Dao are one can truly comprehend it. *Ji* (己) means the self. When the self and Dao are one, it is said, "the self has attained the Dao."

Confucius said: "The Master’s virtue matched Heaven and Earth, yet he still relied on profound words to cultivate his heart. Which ancient noble could surpass this?" Laozi replied: "Not so. Water, when drawn, does nothing yet naturally fulfills its nature. The perfected person’s virtue requires no cultivation, yet things cannot depart from it. Just as Heaven is naturally high, Earth naturally thick, and the sun and moon naturally bright—what need is there for cultivation?" Confucius went out and told Yan Hui: "My grasp of the Dao is like a vinegar gnat. Without the Master’s enlightenment, I would remain confined, unaware of the great wholeness of Heaven and Earth."

*Jia* (假) means "to borrow." *Zhiyan* (至言) refers to the many words above. It means that even Laozi, with such virtue, could not cultivate his heart without relying on words—how could others escape this? *Tuo* (脱) means "to free oneself," implying one cannot seek the Dao without words. *Shuo* (说) is synonymous with *tuo*. Laozi’s "Not so" means that relying on words to cultivate the heart is mistaken. *Zhuo* (汋) means "to draw," the same as *zhuo* (酌). Rivers and seas can be drawn from endlessly because their essence is non-action and naturalness. *Cai* (才) means "essence." What makes water water is its natural essence. The perfected person’s virtue is rooted in nature; though it requires no cultivation, external things cannot separate from it. Heaven, Earth, the sun, and moon are likewise natural—what need is there for effort? Thus it is said, "What cultivation is needed?"

*Xijing* (酰鸡) refers to midges in a vinegar vat. Confined within the vat, how could they know the vastness beyond? This means their vision is small.

When Zhuangzi met Duke Ai of Lu, the Duke said: "Lu has many Ru scholars, but few follow your methods." Zhuangzi replied: "Lu has few Ru." The Duke said: "The whole state of Lu wears Ru robes—how can you say there are few?" Zhuangzi said: "I have heard that Ru scholars wear round caps to know the seasons, square shoes to know the terrain, and jade pendants to decide matters when they arise. But those who possess the Dao need not wear such robes, and those who wear the robes need not know the Dao. If you truly doubt this, why not issue a decree throughout the state: 'Those without the Dao who wear these robes shall be put to death'?"

After five days, no one in Lu dared wear Ru robes. Only one man, dressed as a Ru, stood at the palace gate. The Duke summoned him and questioned him on state affairs; his answers were inexhaustible, shifting through a thousand turns without faltering. Zhuangzi said: "With all of Lu, there is only one Ru—can you call that many?"

*Fang* (方) means "method." This means the Ru scholars of Lu practiced methods different from Zhuangzi’s. *Huanpei jue* (缓佩玦) describes their measured gait and jade pendants, the *jue* symbolizing decisiveness. *Yi zhangfu* (一丈夫) refers to Confucius. The implication is that while many wear Ru robes, few truly know the Dao.

Baoli Xi cared not for rank or salary in his heart, so when he fed cattle, the cattle grew fat, and Duke Mu of Qin forgot his lowly status and entrusted him with governance. The Lords of Yu cared not for life or death in their hearts, and thus could move others. When feeding cattle, how could he have sought rank or salary? Precisely because he did not seek them, he was employed by Duke Mu. "Moving others" means to touch and transform them. "Caring not for life or death" means acting without contrivance, the heart unmoved.

Here again, these two lines are spoken casually.

When the Lord of Song was about to commission paintings, all the scribes arrived, bowed and stood in attendance, with half licking their brushes and grinding ink outside. One scribe arrived late, strolling leisurely, oblivious; he bowed but did not stand still and went to his quarters. The Lord sent someone to observe him, who saw him strip, sit cross-legged and bare-chested. The Lord said: "This is the true painter." *Chanchran* means leisurely and unhurried, at ease. "Bowed but did not stand" means he exchanged courtesies with the other scribes but did not linger. *Panbo* describes the posture of sitting with legs splayed. *Luo* means bare. This speaks of one who is free from the desire for recognition as a true painter. Su Dongpo’s description of painting bamboo and Du Fu’s poetry—"With spirit calm and will composed, he sweeps with a single stroke"—approach this meaning.

King Wen observed at Zang, where he saw an old man fishing, yet his fishing was no fishing—he did not hold his rod as one who fishes, but fished habitually. King Wen wished to raise him and entrust him with governance, yet feared his ministers, elders, and brothers would not accept it. He wished to abandon the idea but could not bear the thought of the people being left without a ruler. Thus, at dawn, he addressed his ministers: "Last night, I dreamed of a worthy man, dark-complexioned and dignified, riding a dappled horse with one red hoof. He commanded: 'Entrust governance to the old man of Zang; perhaps the people will yet recover.'" The ministers, startled, said: "It is your late father, the former king." King Wen said: "Then let us divine it." The ministers replied: "The command of the former king leaves no room for doubt—what need is there for divination?" They then welcomed the old man of Zang and entrusted him with governance. No laws were altered, no decrees issued. After three years, King Wen surveyed the state and saw that the knights had dissolved their factions and scattered, high officials no longer claimed virtue, and foreign measures dared not enter the four borders. When knights dissolve factions and scatter, it shows unity; when high officials do not claim virtue, it shows shared purpose; when foreign measures dare not enter the borders, it shows the lords have no divided loyalties. King Wen then made him Grand Preceptor, faced north, and asked: "Can governance extend to all under heaven?" The old man of Zang, bewildered, did not respond, declined vaguely, and fled that night, never to be heard from again.

This passage recasts the tale of the Grand Duke in a different guise. "Habitual fishing" means the fishing rod is always in hand. Though the rod is in hand, there is no intent to fish—thus it is said he did not hold his rod as one who fishes. Such phrases are all excellent. "Without heaven" means without a master. "One red hoof" means only one hoof was red. "The former king" means the dream was of King Wen’s father. "No laws were altered" means no changes were made to the legal system. "No decrees issued" means no single matter was decreed—hence "no decrees." "Dissolved factions and scattered" means no cliques were formed. "Did not claim virtue" means not taking credit for success, as in the *Book of Changes*: "Some follow the king’s service without success." "Shared purpose" means working with others without distinction. *Yu* refers to measures. When foreign measures of varying sizes dare not enter the borders, it shows the lords all submit—hence "no divided loyalties." "Decree at dawn" means upon hearing King Wen’s command and the question of extending governance to all under heaven, he fled that night and was never heard from again, as in the *Book of Documents*: "To the end, he remained obscure."

Liezi, voicing Bo Hun Wu Ren, drew his bow to full draw, placed a cup of water on his elbow, loosed the arrow, and as one shaft departed, another followed, fitting perfectly into the bowstring. At that moment, he resembled a wooden figure. Bo Hun Wu Ren said: "This is the shooting of one who shoots, not the shooting of one who does not shoot. Once, I climbed a high mountain with you, trod on perilous rocks, stood at the edge of a hundred-fathom abyss—could you have shot then?" Thereupon, Wu Ren ascended the high mountain, trod on perilous rocks, stood at the edge of the abyss, his back turned, hesitating, with two parts of his feet dangling over the edge. He beckoned Liezi forward. Liezi prostrated himself, sweat streaming to his heels. Bo Hun Wu Ren said: "The perfected man gazes above into the blue sky, delves below into the yellow springs, roams the eight directions, yet his spirit and qi remain unchanged. Now you tremble with fear in your eyes—your inner strength is perilous indeed."

"Drew his bow to full draw" means drawing the bow to its fullest. With the front hand straight and the elbow level, a cup of water could be placed upon it—this speaks of steadiness. *Fa* means to shoot. *Shi* means to depart. *Ta* means repeated. *You* means again—the arrow had just departed when another was already on the string. The arrow that had just left was followed by another fitting into the bowstring.

This speaks of one arrow following another with such divine swiftness.

*Xiangren* refers to wooden puppets. "Backing in hesitation" means facing upward toward the heights while one’s back hangs over a deep abyss, the sense of retreating yet never ceasing—hence "hesitation." With three parts of his feet, one part on the bank and two dangling over the void, this was peril in the extreme, yet Bo Hun Wu Ren could do it—this is what is called the pure guarding of qi.

To stand on solid ground and shoot is the ordinary way of shooting, and thus it is said: "not the shooting that is no-shooting." If the spirit can guard the One, then though one gazes above into the blue sky or delves below into the yellow springs, roams the eight directions, the heart remains unmoved. If one’s eyes tremble with fear before perilous or level terrain alike, this is to have never known the learning of the perfected man. To seek the essence of hitting the mark through such shooting is difficult indeed—hence it is said: "your inner strength is perilous indeed."

*Chu* means fear. *Xunmu* means the trembling of the eyes.

Shoulder Wu asked Sun Shu Ao: "You have thrice served as Prime Minister without pride, and thrice resigned without sorrow. At first I doubted you, but now I see the ease between your brows—how do you alone manage your heart?"

Sun Shu Ao replied: "What do I possess beyond others? I accept what comes as unavoidable, and let go what departs as unstoppable. I regard gain and loss as no concern of mine, and thus remain free of sorrow. What do I possess beyond others? Moreover, I know not whether it lies in them or in me—whether what is in them is absent in me, or what is in me is absent in them. I am still hesitating, still looking all around—how could I have leisure to consider whether men are noble or base?"

The ease between his brows showed that his breath was not directed outward but inward, revealing a spirit of self-nourishment. If the honor of being Prime Minister lay in the office itself, it would have no bearing on me; if what makes me honorable lay in myself, it would have no bearing on the office of Prime Minister. Hence it is said: "whether it lies in them or is absent in me, or lies in me or is absent in them." These lines express the essence with great vitality.

"Hesitating and looking all around" means gazing loftily and musing upon heaven and earth—how could one know what men call noble or base?

Confucius heard of this and said: "The true men of old could not be swayed by the clever, seduced by the beautiful, coerced by thieves, or befriended by Fuxi or the Yellow Emperor. Life and death are great indeed, yet they brought no change to themselves—how much less titles and emoluments! Such men passed through Mount Tai without obstruction, entered deep springs without getting wet, dwelt in lowly and humble places without weariness, and filled heaven and earth. Having given to others, they themselves possessed even more."

The clever could not persuade them, for words could not exhaust their meaning. The beautiful could not seduce them, for sensual allure could not corrupt them. Thieves could not plunder them, for brute force could not bend them. Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor could not befriend them, for they withdrew from the world and held it in light regard.

*Jie* means obstruction. Though stone has no gaps, one may still bore through it—hence it is said: "passed through Mount Tai without obstruction." To dwell in poverty and lowliness without distress is what is meant by "dwelling in humble places without weariness." That which fills heaven and earth is the Dao. When the Dao within oneself pervades heaven and earth, and one extends it to transform others, its use is inexhaustible—hence it is said: "having given to others, they themselves possessed even more."

The King of Chu was sitting with the Lord of Fan. After a while, the King of Chu’s attendants announced: "Fan has fallen three times." The Lord of Fan said: "The fall of Fan is not enough to lose what I possess. If the fall of Fan is not enough to lose what I possess, then the survival of Chu is not enough to preserve its survival."

From this perspective, Fan had never truly fallen, nor had Chu ever truly existed. This is like the amputee who loses a foot yet retains what is honorable in the foot—here the same idea is expressed differently. It means that the Dao within oneself is unaffected by whether one has a state or not. If Fan’s fall does not constitute loss, and Chu’s survival does not constitute preservation, then the world’s gains and losses, fortunes and misfortunes, are all external things. Yet the deeper meaning lies in the phrase: "the survival of Chu is not enough to preserve its survival."

If loss is not enough to cause oneself shame, then gain is not enough to cause oneself pride. *Zi qian* means shame; *zi jin* means boasting. These words are especially profound—words of learning that one applies to oneself.

**Outer Chapters: "Knowledge Wanders North"**

Knowledge wandered north to the Dark Waters, ascended Mount Hidden Gate (or "Hidden Gate Peak," *yinfen* or *fanfen*), and there encountered Non-Action’s Discourse. Knowledge said to Non-Action’s Discourse: "I wish to ask you something. What thoughts, what reflections lead to knowing the Dao? What dwelling, what conduct lead to resting in the Dao? What following, what path lead to attaining the Dao?"

Three questions, yet Non-Action’s Discourse gave no answer. Not that he refused to answer—he did not know how. Knowledge, receiving no reply, returned south of the White Waters, ascended Fox Tower, and there beheld Mad Qu. Knowledge repeated his questions to Mad Qu. Mad Qu said: "Ah! I know the answer—I will tell you." But midway through speaking, he forgot what he wished to say.

Knowledge, still unanswered, returned to the Emperor’s palace and questioned the Yellow Emperor. The Yellow Emperor said: "Without thought, without reflection, one begins to know the Dao. Without dwelling, without conduct, one begins to rest in the Dao. Without following, without path, one begins to attain the Dao."

Knowledge asked the Yellow Emperor: "You and I know it, but those two do not. Which of us is correct?" The Yellow Emperor said: "That Non-Action’s Discourse is truly right; Mad Qu approximates it; you and I never come close. These three names are all allegorical, each distinct in meaning. *Knowledge* is one who possesses a thinking mind. *Non-Action’s Discourse* is spontaneity itself. *Mad* means wild and unrestrained; *Qu* means stiff, like a withered branch. In this text, the term *mad* (*changkuang*) aligns with the *floating* (*fuyou*) of the *Free and Easy Wandering*. Wild and stiff—this is the appearance of one without knowledge. This passage simply means that those who know do not speak, and those who speak do not know, hence the elaborate staging of dialogue. Asking yet receiving no answer—this is like the Chan saying, 'There is no old monk here, nor any *jieli* before me.' Mad Qu, forgetting his words mid-reply, still knew there was a questioner. Thus it is said: Non-Action is truly right, Mad Qu approximates it, coming closer. For those who know do not speak, and those who speak do not know—hence the sage practices the teaching without words.

The Dao cannot be attained, virtue cannot be reached. Benevolence may be practiced, righteousness may be diminished, and ritual is mutual pretense. Thus it is said: Lose the Dao, then comes virtue; lose virtue, then comes benevolence; lose benevolence, then comes righteousness; lose righteousness, then comes ritual. Ritual is the flower of the Dao and the beginning of disorder. Therefore it is said: Those who practice the Dao daily diminish, diminishing further and further, until they reach non-action. Through non-action, nothing is left undone.

Now, if one has become a thing (*wu*) and wishes to return to the root, is this not difficult? How easy it is—only for the great person! Those who know do not speak—this is Bodhidharma’s coming from the West without relying on words, directly pointing to the human mind, seeing one’s nature and becoming a Buddha. The teaching without words is the Vimalakīrti’s *non-dual dharma-gate*. The Dao cannot be attained—it cannot be reached through words. Virtue cannot be reached—it cannot be sought through traces. Benevolence, righteousness, and ritual are all progressions, all traces, and where there are traces, the Dao is ruined. Zhuangzi regarded ritual as forcing the world, hence he compared it to benevolence and righteousness, whose traces are even more excessive. Thus he called it the *flower* of the Dao—the beginning of disorder. A flower is outward adornment without substance. Such external pretense gives rise to deceit and fraud—hence it is the beginning of disorder.

To discard cleverness, to cast off limbs and body—this is the daily diminishing of the Dao. Diminishing further and further until reaching nothingness is to forget one’s former self. Able to practice non-action, one follows the spontaneity of Heaven’s principle, and nothing remains impossible. *Things* (*wu*) are traces. Seeking the Dao while still clinging to traces means one remains the same as other things, and thus to see one’s own root and origin is indeed difficult. *Returning to the root* means gathering inward and returning to the state before things existed. The *great person* is one who practices non-action. The phrase *how easy it is* follows Zhuangzi’s style; another writer might say, "Only the great person finds it easy."

Those who are born are companions of death; those who die are the beginning of life. Who knows their guiding principle? Human life is the gathering of *qi*; when *qi* gathers, there is life; when it disperses, there is death. If death and life are companions, what have I to fear? Thus the myriad things are one. What they deem beautiful is wondrous and strange; what they despise is foul and rotten. Yet the foul and rotten transform into the wondrous and strange, and the wondrous and strange transform back into the foul and rotten. Thus it is said: The world is united by a single *qi*. Therefore the sage values oneness.

"Those who are born are companions of death; those who die are the beginning of life"—the latter phrase is easy to explain, the former more difficult. Consider the flowering of plants into branches and leaves—this is their life. Yet what has already flourished must inevitably perish; thus what is born is already dead. As Master Yichuan said: "The breath that re-enters is not the breath that has already left." This saying is excellent—it captures the same meaning. The hard fruit that remains unharvested is peeled away—this is the sprouting of return. To call it a *sudden fruit* is to declare it dead; when planted again, it revives. Is this not death as the beginning of life? The coming and going of death and life apply to all things—who knows the principle behind it? *Guiding principle* (*ji*) means the net’s cord, the one who governs and brings it about.

The gathering and scattering of *qi* give rise to life and death—this all know. But if one understands that death and life are a single principle, then what have I to fear? *Companions* means death and life are one. Death and life are fundamentally one principle, applying to all things. Yet people distinguish beauty and ugliness, love and hate. When flowers and plants are in full bloom, they are deemed wondrous and strange; when they fall to the ground, they become foul and rotten. Yet they do not realize that fallen leaves nourish the roots, and life begins anew from this—thus the foul and rotten transform into the wondrous and strange. Once flourishing and then fallen, the wondrous and strange transform back into the foul and rotten.

From ancient times to the present, through all the comings and goings, there is only this single *qi*. The sage understands this, and thus does not distinguish between life and death, success and failure, fortune and misfortune—hence it is said the sage values the One. The One is without distinction.

Yi asked Wuweiwei, "Wuweiwei did not respond to me." It was not that he refused to respond, but that he did not know how to respond. I asked Kuang Qu, and Kuang Qu wished to tell me but did not—it was not that he refused to tell me, but that in wishing to tell, he forgot. Now I ask you, and you know it—why then do you not come near?

The Yellow Emperor said: "He is truly so because he does not know. He seems so because he has forgotten. You and I will never come near, because you know."

Kuang Qu heard this and regarded the Yellow Emperor as one who spoke truly.

These few lines clarify the preceding meaning with great clarity.

Heaven and earth possess great beauty yet do not speak; the four seasons follow clear patterns yet do not debate; the myriad things have their inherent principles yet do not explain. The sage traces the beauty of heaven and earth and comprehends the principles of the myriad things—thus the perfected person does nothing, the great sage does not act, for this is what it means to observe heaven and earth.

Now, that which is spiritually luminous and most refined, together with the hundred transformations—whether things live or die, take square or round form—none know their root. Yet all things have existed since antiquity, spontaneously so. The six directions are vast, yet they do not depart from its bounds; the tip of an autumn hair is minute, yet it depends on this to take form. Under heaven, none do not rise and fall, yet throughout life, nothing remains fixed.

Yin and yang, the four seasons, move in their courses, each keeping to its proper order—dimly as if absent yet present, effortlessly without form yet spiritually potent. The ten thousand things are nurtured yet do not know it—this is called the root and origin, by which one may observe heaven.

Heaven and earth possess great beauty yet do not speak—this is like the *Qian* hexagram, which "with beautiful virtue benefits all under heaven without speaking," for what it benefits is truly great. The "clear patterns" refer to the coming and going of cold and heat, the waxing and waning, growth and decline—all following a distinct and unchanging law. How could they be subject to deliberation? Hence it is said they do not debate.

The hare’s legs are short, the crane’s long; wheat droops, millet stands upright; some are cold, some hot; some bitter, some sweet—all are the principles of nature. Yet how can one explain why they are long or short, bitter or sweet? Thus it is said they have their inherent principles yet do not explain.

"Not acting" is the same as "non-doing"; "non-doing" and "not acting" both mean following nature. The sage’s way of following nature is simply to grasp the greatness of heaven and earth—hence it is said this is what it means to observe heaven and earth.

"Spiritually luminous and most refined" refers to the subtle principle. "Hundred transformations" refers to the transformations of the hundred things. The first "that" refers to heaven, the second to things. Whether things live or die, whether in life they take square or round form—all is brought about by that which is spiritually luminous and most refined. Yet once they exist, who can fathom the ultimate root? Thus it is said: whether things live or die, take square or round form, none know their root.

"Spontaneously" is like "fluttering"—it carries the sense of ceaseless departure, like the saying "that which passes is like this." The transformations of the ten thousand things follow one another without end, yet their creative power remains constant—what Su Dongpo called "that which passes is like this, yet it never truly departs." Without true insight, one could not speak of this.

The six directions are vast, yet they do not depart from its bounds—this means that though heaven and earth are great, they do not go beyond the bounds of creation. The tip of an autumn hair is minute, yet it depends on this to take form—without this minute form, there would be no name for the autumn hair, just as "under heaven, nothing is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small."

"Rising and falling" means coming and going; "nothing remains fixed" means ever-renewing. The ten thousand things come and go without end, day after day—hence it is said under heaven, none do not rise and fall, yet throughout life, nothing remains fixed. Precisely because nothing remains fixed, the four seasons move in their courses and keep to their proper order.

"Dimly" means not visible. "Effortlessly" means the vitality of life. "As if absent yet present"—the dead are companions to the living. "Without form yet spiritually potent"—it does not rely on form to exist, nor does it perish with life. "Nurtured"—means to nourish. That which nourishes the ten thousand things is the Dao. Yet people do not know it—this is the root and origin of creation. To observe heaven is nothing beyond this principle—hence it is said one may observe heaven thereby.

Nie Que asked the Way of Bei Yi. Bei Yi said: "Straighten your body, unify your gaze, and the harmony of heaven will come. Gather in your knowledge, unify your thoughts, and spirit will come to dwell. Virtue will become your beauty, the Dao will become your dwelling. Your eyes will be bright as a newborn calf’s, seeking nothing of the old."

Before he had finished speaking, Nie Que fell asleep. Bei Yi was greatly pleased and departed singing, saying: "His form like withered bones, his heart like dead ashes—truly he knows reality. He does not cling to the old, drifting in dim obscurity, his mind empty and beyond consultation. What manner of man is this?"

This passage once again presents two who know the Way conversing—what the Buddhists call "a master’s hand presenting to a master’s hand, a red heart within a red heart."

"Straighten your body, unify your gaze"—this means forgetting the body, ears, and eyes. "Gather in your knowledge, unify your thoughts"—this means abandoning deliberation and consciousness. "Thoughts" refers to mental deliberation.

"The harmony of heaven" is the primordial *qi*. Forgetting the body, ears, and eyes, the primordial *qi* is preserved whole. "Spirit"—what the Buddhists call "the master within"—comes and goes without fixed time, without known abode, thus it comes to dwell.

"Virtue will become your beauty"—virtue moistens the body. "The Dao will become your dwelling"—dwelling in the vast dwelling of all under heaven. "Bright"—the look of one who knows nothing yet gazes directly. A newborn calf does not fail to look, yet what does it truly see? The same is true of an infant.

"Seeking no reason for things"—this means one does not know how it is that they see. This describes the appearance of being without mind. "Before speech is finished, one falls asleep"—this means that as soon as the answer is given, one naturally sleeps, for the meaning is mutually understood without need for words, hence such a state arises.

"Truly one who knows in reality"—this means one who truly sees this principle. Matters and things do not enter their mind, hence it is said, 'they do not rely on reasons to sustain themselves.' *Gu* here means 'matters.' 'Vague and obscure, indistinct and unseen'—this describes the state of being without form or trace.

Since they are without mind while I have something that cannot be put into words, it is said, 'being without mind, they cannot be consulted.' Between heaven and earth, there exists such a person—hence it is said, 'What manner of person is this?' This is deep praise indeed.

Shun asked Cheng, 'Can the Dao be possessed?' Cheng replied, 'Your body is not your own possession—how can you possess the Dao?' Shun said, 'If my body is not my own, then who possesses it?' Cheng said, 'It is the form entrusted by heaven and earth. Life is not your possession—it is the harmony entrusted by heaven and earth. Nature and destiny are not your possession—they are the compliance entrusted by heaven and earth. Children and grandchildren are not your possession—they are the shedding entrusted by heaven and earth.

Thus, in walking, one does not know where one is going; in dwelling, one does not know what one is holding; in eating, one does not know the taste—this is the strong yang *qi* of heaven and earth. How then can it be possessed? *Wei* means 'to gather.' The four great elements temporarily combine to form this body, hence it is called 'entrusted form.' Only after yin and yang harmonize does life arise, hence it is said, 'life is entrusted harmony.' *Shun* means 'principle.' Nature and destiny reside within me as the principle of creation, hence it is called 'entrusted compliance.' Generations succeed one another like the molting of cicadas, hence it is said, 'children and grandchildren.' *Wei* means 'to shed.' Strong yang *qi* is vital *qi*—that which moves is yang. Human walking, dwelling, and eating are all brought about by the movement of this *qi*—none of it is truly one's own. This is the meaning of the *Yuanjue* sutra’s 'Where shall this body now abide?' This passage is also most extraordinary. 'Not knowing what one holds' means having no attachments."

Confucius asked Lao Dan, "This evening, may I dare to inquire about the supreme Dao?" Lao Dan said, "Purify yourself through fasting, dredge and clear your mind, cleanse and refresh your spirit, and shatter your knowledge. The Dao—how profoundly difficult it is to speak of! I shall tell you its rough outlines.

Brightness emerges from darkness; order arises from formlessness. Spirit is born of the Dao; form originates from essence. And the myriad things give birth to one another through form. Thus, those with nine orifices are born from the womb, while those with eight orifices are born from eggs." *Shuyue* means 'to dredge and guide.' *Zaoxue* means 'to wash and cleanse.' *Pouji* means 'to cast aside.' *Yaoran* describes a profound appearance. *Yai* means 'boundary.' *Yailüe* means that since the profound and wondrous are difficult to express, one can only speak of their rough outlines.

*Zhaozhao* refers to what is visible; *mingming* to what is invisible. What can be seen and distinguished is called 'having order'—this is the myriad things. 'Formless' refers to creation. 'Spirit' resides within humans. 'Form' is what is visible; 'essence' is what is invisible. 'Nine orifices' refers to humans; 'eight orifices' to birds. Speaking of humans and birds together is to humble them. The Buddhist sutras’ categories of womb-born, egg-born, and moisture-born all originate from this idea. The meaning here is that though humans are nobler than other beings, their birth is in fact the same—hence one should rejoice in relinquishing the colored body to seek the Dharma-body. This is also the intent of Zhuangzi.

Its coming leaves no trace; its going has no boundary. Without gate or chamber, its sound spreads in all directions, vast and boundless. Those who attain this have strong limbs, penetrating thoughts, keen hearing and sight. Their minds do not labor, and their responses to things are without fixed form. Heaven cannot but be high, earth cannot but be broad, the sun and moon cannot but move, and the myriad things cannot but flourish—this is the Dao.

'Its coming leaves no trace; its going has no boundary'—this speaks of the transformations of creation, where what departs and what arrives cannot be traced. 'Spreading in all directions, vast and boundless'—this describes the great emptiness. Human dwellings have gates and chambers, but in the great emptiness, one only sees its vastness—how could one know where it enters or exits? 'Those who attain this' means those who seek and perceive this Dao. 'Strong limbs' is what the *Yuanjue* sutra calls 'the body being light and at ease.' *Xundá* means 'penetrating and thorough.' 'Not laboring' means following nature. 'Without fixed form' means being unfixed—this is to respond to things as they arise in the mind.

If not for this Dao, who would bring about heaven, earth, the sun, moon, and the myriad things? These four lines merely describe how, from top to bottom, there is nothing that is not this Dao.

Moreover, extensive knowledge is not necessarily true knowledge; eloquence is not necessarily wisdom—this the sage has already decided. As for that which, when increased, does not become more, and when diminished, does not become less—this is what the sage preserves. Profound as the sea, lofty in its endless cycling. It measures and sustains the myriad things without exhaustion. Thus, the Dao of the noble person—is it external to them? The myriad things all draw from it without exhaustion—this is the Dao.

There is a person within the central kingdom, neither yin nor yang, dwelling between heaven and earth. Upright and human, they will return to the source. Viewed from their origin, life is but the exhalation of dark and turbid *qi*—the same as a sigh. Though there are differences in longevity, how far apart are they? This is but a moment’s matter—how could it suffice to distinguish between Yao and Jie?

'Extensive knowledge' means knowing everything. Human eloquence and learning are all boasting of one’s own abilities, not necessarily arising from one’s own wisdom. That by which one is wise is the work of creation."

Thus, the sage judges only by the work of creation, neither taking increase as increase nor decrease as decrease. What they preserve lies within themselves, and external things cannot add to it—this is the sage’s affair. Ending, then, returning to the beginning, the pure ceaselessly continues. They measure and move the myriad things without exhaustion, responding to things without limit. To move and measure them is called "measuring and moving." This is not yet free from intention, for it remains the Way of the noble person—it speaks only of their traces. When I respond to things, it is called "measuring and moving the myriad things"; when things arrive and I respond to them, it is called "the myriad things all drawing from it"—this is but responding after being stirred, moving after being pressed. If this does not exhaust, then it is called the Way. The Way is without intention, without trace.

There is a person within the central kingdom—this means there is a perfected person within heaven and earth. Neither yin nor yang, it cannot be named by things. They possess the form of a human, yet their heart roams at the origin of things, merely lodging their form between heaven and earth. Thus it is said: upright and human, they will return to the source. The source is the origin of the myriad things. *Yinyin* is *qi* that is not smooth. When the *qi* of the human body is not smooth, it becomes warts and tumors; when the *qi* of creation gives rise to humans, it is also that which is not smooth. Thus it is said: "viewed from their origin"—this means returning to the beginning of heaven and earth to observe. This idea is a denigration of the human body, akin to the Buddhist notion of a "skin-bag filled with blood." Upon close examination, many discourses in the *Tripitaka* emerge from this. The right and wrong of Yao and Jie refer to the judgments of the human world, which arise only after the existence of this body. Though lifespans vary within a hundred years, compared to heaven and earth, it is but a moment. These few lines are well said.

Fruits and melons have their principles; human relationships, though difficult, are ordered by seniority. The sage encounters them without resistance, passes them without clinging. To harmonize and respond is virtue; to coincide and respond is the Way. This is how emperors rise and kings emerge. Human life between heaven and earth is like a white colt passing a gap—suddenly, it is gone. Bursting forth, surging, all things emerge; flowing, limpid, all things return. Fruits and melons, the most insignificant of things, have their seasons of growth and their seeds of propagation. From ancient times to the present, their kinds remain unmingled—is this not the principle of spontaneity? Taking the smallest to speak of it, the greater can be known.

Though human relationships contain many hardships—such as the restraints of hierarchy, the oppressions of the strong over the weak, the sorrows and joys of longevity and early death—all these are hardships. Yet, dwelling together in the cosmos, they form an order of seniority: ruler and minister, father and son, the central states and the barbarians—all are but one thing among the works of creation. The sage says: "Things gather by kind, and are divided by leather." Here, there is no distinction between refined and coarse, self and other—all are said to be ordered by seniority. This, too, is a lofty discourse.

"Encountering without resistance" means facing times of adversity and prosperity, and simply following them. "Passing without clinging" means that what passes is transformation. To harmonize is to attune; to coincide is to align. Responding spontaneously to stimuli, joining in harmony—this is the naturalness of virtue and the Way. The rise of emperors and kings does not exceed this principle. "Suddenly" is the meaning of "a moment." Emergence is birth, extension, coming; return is death, contraction, going. *Zhuran boran* describes the state of being pushed and surging forth; *youran liaoran* describes liveliness and ripeness. This is the extension of what departs and the contraction of what arrives—what the *Yijing* calls "exhausting the spirit and knowing transformation."

Having transformed and been born, then transformed and died, living things mourn it, and humankind grieves. Loosening heaven’s bow-case, casting off heaven’s sack, tangled and winding, the hun and po are about to depart, and the body follows. Thus, the great return. Things, initially born from nothing into being, then transformed from being into nothing—it is the same principle, yet the kinds of humans and things deem it sorrowful. How deluded! The *tao* is the case that holds a bow; the *cuo* is a sack. Deluded people still have something wrapped up and do not understand. If they could awaken, they would loosen the bow-case and cast off the sack. To cast off is to discard, to abandon. *Fenhu wanhu*—*wan* means to turn, to speak of transformation. The hun and po are the spirit. When the spirit is about to scatter, the body follows. Thus, it is called the "great return," meaning to return to one’s dwelling.

The formless form, the formed formlessness—this is what all people know, yet it is not the concern of those who are about to reach the ultimate. This is the common discourse of the multitude. Those who reach the ultimate do not discourse; those who discourse do not reach it. The "formless form" is that which cannot be seen; the "formed formlessness" is the form within the physical body that cannot be seen. This is what the Buddha called: "Only the Dharmakāya abides eternally, unperishing." Yet, though all people know this, they cannot depart from form to seek it, and thus do not attain it. *Wu* means "affair." If one studies and aims to reach the ultimate, what they pursue is not limited to this alone. Thus, it is said: "not the concern of those who are about to reach the ultimate." The multitude’s discourse is all like this, yet none have reached it. Thus, it is said: "this is the common discourse of the multitude." Further expounding on this: those who can reach the ultimate do not discourse; as soon as there is this discourse, it is not reaching. Thus, it is said: "those who reach the ultimate do not discourse; those who discourse do not reach it." For the "formless form" is fundamentally easy to know and does not require words. If one takes this as a subject of discourse, it is because they have not yet attained its most wondrous state.

This further elevates the discourse.

Clear perception finds no value; disputation is not as good as silence.
The Dao cannot be heard; hearing is not as good as blocking one’s ears.
This is called "great attainment."

"Value" means grasping something through perception—this is perception with traces.
The Dao cannot be perceived through form or traces, hence no value is found.
Thus it is said: "clear perception finds no value."
Disputation is not as good as silence; as soon as there is disputation, it is already wrong.
*Mo* means "not speaking."
As for the Dao, it is not heard from another but heard within oneself.
To call it "hearing" is already not the Dao.
Having heard is not as good as not having heard.
"Blocking" means stopping one’s ears to hear nothing.
Thus it is said: "the Dao cannot be heard; hearing is not as good as blocking."

"Great attainment" means profound mastery.

Dongguo Zi asked Zhuangzi: "Where does the so-called Dao reside?"
Zhuangzi said: "It is nowhere not present."
Dongguo Zi said: "Specify a place, then it can be confirmed."
Zhuangzi said: "It is in the ants."
Dongguo Zi said: "How can it be so lowly?"
Zhuangzi said: "It is in the millet stalks."
Dongguo Zi said: "How can it be even lower?"
Zhuangzi said: "It is in the tiles."
Dongguo Zi said: "How can it be even more so?"
Zhuangzi said: "It is in excrement and urine."
Dongguo Zi fell silent. Zhuangzi said: "Your question fundamentally does not reach the essence.
The inquiry of Zheng Huo to the market supervisor about weighing pigs—each descent reveals more.
This passage is exceptionally well composed.
Though it may seem like an extreme statement, all things, whether refined or coarse, emerge from the same principle—this too is a valid point.
What the Buddhists call 'the insentient preaching the Dharma'—tiles and shards blazing, constantly expounding—expresses this same idea.
'Specify a place, then it can be confirmed' means designating a location to verify the root.
Your question does not reach the root, hence my answers descend further.
The 'market supervisor' is like today’s head of the butchers’ guild.
'Weighing pigs' means pressing one’s foot on a pig to gauge its weight.
'More' means comparison; 'descent' refers to the lowest of the market workers.
The official Zheng Huo, who assesses the fatness or leanness of pigs, if asked about the most base, would make the comparison even clearer.
Thus it is said: 'each descent reveals more.'
*Zheng* refers to the market inspector; *Huo* is a person’s name.
This serves as an analogy for those who inquire about the Dao.

You must not be fixed; nothing escapes the realm of things.
The supreme Dao is like this; grand discourse is likewise.
"All-pervading," "universal," and "complete"—these are different names for the same reality, pointing to the one.
Once we roamed together in the Palace of Nothing-Whatsoever, merging in discussion without end.
Once we practiced non-action together—serene and still, vast and clear, harmonious and at ease.
My aspiration is emptied; I go nowhere without knowing where I arrive, depart and come without knowing where I rest.
I have gone and come without knowing its end, wandering in boundless vastness, where great knowledge enters without knowing its limit.

"Not fixed" means having no rigid attachment.
If you have no rigid attachment in your heart, then the principle of all things cannot escape—how could you doubt my words?
Thus it is said: "the supreme Dao is like this; grand discourse is likewise."
"All-pervading," "universal," and "complete" share the same meaning, hence "different names for the same reality."
This sentence illustrates that things, whether refined or coarse, share the same principle.

The Palace of Nothing-Whatsoever embodies the aspiration without rigid attachment.
"Merging in discussion" means that without distinction between refined and coarse, all are discussed as one—how could there be an end?
"Harmonious and at ease" means peace and tranquility.
"Serene and still," "vast and clear," "harmonious and at ease"—all describe the wonder of non-action.

"Emptied" means emptiness; *yi* is the same as *already*.
To have investigated this wonder of emptiness and oneness is to fulfill my aspiration.
Thus it is said: "my aspiration is emptied."
These four characters are concise yet powerful.
If there is no going, how can there be arrival? Though there is departure and coming, there is no place to rest.
Having expressed the unknowability of going and coming, it concludes: "I have gone and come without knowing its end."
Thus, one only sees wandering in boundless vastness, entering great knowledge without knowing its limit.
"Wandering" means roaming freely.
"Boundless vastness" means emptiness and openness.
"Great knowledge" means the supreme Dao.

The one who things things is without boundary with things, yet things have boundaries—this is what is called the boundary of things.
The boundary of the boundless is the boundless boundary.
This refers to fullness and emptiness, growth and decline: what is fullness is not fullness, what is emptiness is not emptiness; what is growth is not growth, what is decline is not decline; what is root and branch is not root and branch; what is accumulation and dispersal is not accumulation and dispersal.

The one without boundary with things is the one who transforms with things.
Transforming with things, one can thing things—this is what is called "the one who does not thing things can thing things."
Without transforming with things, there are boundaries.
With boundaries, one is limited by them.
With boundaries, there is limitation.
Thus it is said: "things have boundaries—this is what is called the boundary of things."
Reaching the limitless from the limited, exhausting the inexhaustible from the exhaustible—this is to be unbounded by the boundaries of things and attain the unbounded.
Thus it is the boundary of the boundless.
This means perceiving the absence of boundaries within the bounded.
The formless form, the form of the formless; the boundary of the boundless, the boundless boundary—such phrasing is where Zhuangzi’s writing excels.

"Decline" means flourishing and decline; "killing" means rising and falling.
Mentioning one implies the other.
Fullness and emptiness, flourishing and decline, root and branch, gathering and dispersal—all seem to have traces yet are ultimately inexhaustible.
This is the boundary of the boundless, the boundless boundary.

Zhi Hegan and Shennong studied together under Old Dragon Ji.
Shennong leaned on his desk, closed the door, and dozed at midday.
Zhi Hegan, returning from the wild at noon, pushed open the door and entered, saying: "Old Dragon is dead."

Shennong leaned on his staff and rose, then cast it aside with a clatter and laughed, saying: "Heaven knew my perversity, my sloth, my arrogance—thus he abandoned me and died. Alas, Master! You died without uttering the words that would have roused my madness."

Yan Gang, upon hearing this while offering condolences, said: "Those who embody the Dao are whom the noble ones of the world revere. Now, in the Dao, not even a fraction of the tip of an autumn hair has been attained—yet he still knew to conceal his mad words and die. How much more so for those who truly embody the Dao?"

The Dao has no form to see, no sound to hear. When people discuss it, they call it "the obscure"—this is how they speak of the Dao, yet it is not the Dao. *Zha* means "to open"; he pushed open the door and entered. *Boran* is the sound of casting aside the staff. "Heaven knew me" refers to Shennong addressing Old Dragon Ji. While the Master lived, he could awaken my grand words; now that he is dead, there are no words to awaken me—this means Old Dragon Ji died without speaking. *Yan* is his surname, *Gang* his given name. He heard Shennong’s words while mourning Old Dragon. Those who embody the Dao become one with it. *Xi* means "to revere and follow." If there are those who embody the Dao, all noble ones of the world will revere and follow them. Though Shennong had not yet perceived the Dao, he still understood that Old Dragon’s death was a concealment of his mad words—how much more so for those who embody the Dao as Old Dragon did? "Mad words" are grand words; the meaning is that the Dao resides in silence, and concealing one’s words in death is the way of the Dao. Though Shennong had not reached this state, he still spoke thus—how much more so for those greater than Shennong? The tip of an autumn hair is exceedingly small; to not even attain a ten-thousandth part of it is to have attained the least of the least. Buddhist scriptures also employ such numerical metaphors. The Dao has no sound or form; it cannot be seen or heard. If one discusses it with others, calling it "the obscure" is merely a forced designation—it is not the Dao. Thus, it is said that this is how one speaks of the Dao, yet it is not the Dao. This expresses the idea that the speaker does not know. Form and sound are "being"; "the obscure" is "non-being." To know being as non-being is not as good as merging with the non-being of non-being. This suggests that Shennong’s words still did not constitute true knowledge of the Dao.

Thereupon, Tai Qing asked Wu Qiong: "Do you know the Dao?"
Wu Qiong said: "I do not know."
He then asked Wu Wei, who said: "I know the Dao."
Tai Qing said: "Does your knowledge of the Dao have a pattern?"
Wu Wei said: "It does."
Tai Qing asked: "What is its pattern?"
Wu Wei said: "I know the Dao can be noble, can be base, can be gathered, can be dispersed—this is the pattern by which I know the Dao."

Tai Qing then asked Wu Shi: "If so, then is Wu Qiong’s not-knowing correct, or is Wu Wei’s knowing correct? Which is right and which is wrong?"
Wu Shi said: "Not-knowing is profound; knowing is shallow. Not-knowing is internal; knowing is external."

Thereupon, Tai Qing sighed and said: "Is not-knowing then knowing? Is knowing then not-knowing? Who knows the knowing of not-knowing?"
Wu Shi said: "The Dao cannot be heard; to hear it is not it. The Dao cannot be seen; to see it is not it. The Dao cannot be spoken; to speak it is not it. Do you know that which gives form to the formless? The Dao should not be named."

Wu Shi said: "Those who answer when asked about the Dao do not know the Dao. Even those who ask about it have not heard the Dao. The Dao has no questions; questions have no answers. To ask without asking is to ask exhaustively; to answer without answering is to lack inner attainment. Responding to exhaustive questions with no inner attainment—such a one does not observe the cosmos externally nor know the Great Beginning internally. Thus, he does not pass beyond Kunlun nor roam the Great Void. The opening phrase, marked by these two characters, is like the Buddhist scriptures’ 'Thus have I heard,' which begins with 'thus.'"

The "pattern" of the Dao refers to what can be enumerated and spoken of—nobility and baseness, gathering and dispersal are all things that can be enumerated in the Dao. *Yue* means "to gather," to inwardly attain. "External" means to be separate from the Dao. The knowing of not-knowing is the ineffable subtlety. "That which gives form to the formless" is like "only the non-thing can give form to things." *Dang* means "to correspond." If the Dao has a name, then the name stands opposite the Dao, departing from its original truth—thus, the Dao should not be named. The Dao has no questions; to ask and answer is to depart from the Dao. The questioner’s hearing is also not the Dao. "Asking exhaustively" means that one’s understanding reaches its limit in questioning—this refers to being mired in language and seeking knowledge through views. "Lacking inner attainment" means the center has not attained the Dao; if one had attained it, one would not answer. The cosmos is what can be seen, thus it is "external." The Great Beginning is what cannot be seen, thus it is "internal." Kunlun lies beyond the cosmos, and the Great Void lies beyond Kunlun. If one has not even passed Kunlun, how can one reach the Great Void?

Guang Yao asked Wu You: "Does the Master exist, or is he non-existent?"
Unable to obtain an answer, Guang Yao gazed intently at Wu You’s appearance—it was vast and empty. He looked at him all day without seeing, listened without hearing, and sought to grasp him without success.

Guang Yao said: "This is perfection! Who could attain this? I can attain being and non-being, but I have not yet attained non-being of non-being. How could I reach this state of non-existence?"

The phrase "gazing intently at his appearance" merely describes the Dao’s invisibility. "I can attain being and non-being, but I have not yet attained non-being of non-being"—this saying is subtler still. If one has not attained non-being of non-being, then one remains within the realm of "non-being," possessed by the concept of "non-being." How could one reach the state of vast emptiness?

The *Yuanjue* states: "To speak of non-awakening is likewise so. To awaken and arrive at non-awakening may be called sublime. Yet even to regard non-awakening as incomplete is to remain within the meaning of 'non-being of non-being'—that is, to have not yet attained 'non-existence.' The earlier terms—*zhi* (knowing), *wuwei* (non-action), *Taiqing* (Great Clarity), *Wushi* (Without Beginning)—and these later ones—*Guangyao* (Radiant Brilliance), *wuyou* (non-existence)—all such names convey their meaning with great clarity, unlike others such as Wang Ni or Pi Yi.

The forger of hooks under Grand Marshal Ma was eighty years old yet never erred by a hair’s breadth. Grand Marshal Ma said: 'Are you skillful, or do you possess the Way?' He replied: 'I have my discipline. At twenty, I delighted in forging hooks, seeing nothing beyond them. I observed nothing but hooks—this is to employ the non-employed to long preserve its use. How much more so for that which employs nothing yet employs all? What thing would not depend on it?'

A hook is a belt-hook. Grand Marshal Ma is the Grand Marshal. *Chui* means to forge. Among the Grand Marshal’s subordinates was a hook-forger, aged yet peerless in precision, without the slightest deviation—this describes his skill. 'Observing nothing but hooks' echoes the earlier 'knowing only the cicada’s wings,' for his mind was fixed solely on hooks, seeing nothing beyond. 'The employed' is skill; 'the non-employed' is the naturalness of the Dao; 'the non-employing that employs all' is the Dao’s non-action that accomplishes all. He says: 'I take the non-employed’s natural wonder and apply it to skill, thereby preserving its use into old age. How much more so for the Dao, which employs nothing yet accomplishes all? What in the world does not rely on it?'

Ran Qiu asked Confucius: 'Can one know what preceded heaven and earth?' Confucius said: 'Yes. The past is like the present.' Ran Qiu, unsatisfied with the answer, withdrew. The next day, he returned and said: 'Yesterday, I asked whether one could know what preceded heaven and earth, and you said, "Yes, the past is like the present." Yesterday, I understood clearly; today, I am confused. May I ask what you meant?' Confucius said: 'Yesterday’s clarity came from the spirit’s prior reception; today’s confusion arises from seeking with what is not spirit. Without past or present, without beginning or end—could there be descendants before there were ancestors? Is this possible?'

Ran Qiu did not respond. Confucius said: 'Enough. You have not yet grasped it. Do not take life to give death, nor take death to give life. Do life and death depend on one another? They are of one body. Is there something that existed before heaven and earth? That which gives rise to things is not itself a thing. A thing cannot precede that which gives rise to things—yet there is indeed something. The sage’s ceaseless love for others likewise draws from this.

At the inception of the Great Ultimate, yin and yang divided to form heaven and earth. Heaven and earth move, yin and yang alternate, cycling endlessly. The past is like this; the present is like this. To answer the question of what preceded heaven and earth by saying 'the past is like the present' carries this meaning.

*Zhaozhao* means seeing with utmost clarity. 'Spirit' refers to one’s own awareness; 'non-spirit' is when awareness’s luminosity is obscured by qi. Yesterday’s clarity came from the presence of empty, numinous awareness, hence its reception; today’s confusion arises from its absence, hence further seeking without understanding.

'Without past or present, without beginning or end'—this speaks of the principle of the Great Ultimate, which moves and rests without ceasing. The principle of creation is inexhaustibly generative, like the existence of descendants: one does not wait for their birth to know of them. With humanity, there are descendants; with the cosmos, there are yin and yang—without a moment’s interruption.

'Enough. You have not yet grasped it.' To speak of 'life' is to imply 'death,' for death follows from life; to speak of 'death' is to imply 'life,' for life follows from death’s name. Thus, the four words 'no life, no death' are expressed through such transformations. Life and death depend on one another, yet they are of one body—one root, one principle, the spontaneity of creation.

'That which gives rise to things is not itself a thing'—then there must be a non-thing that existed before heaven and earth. How can it be named a 'thing'? Hence, 'Is there something that existed before heaven and earth?' To say it is not a thing is to avoid naming it as such; once named a 'thing,' it cannot precede heaven and earth. This is to posit something—hence, 'a thing cannot precede that which gives rise to things, yet there is indeed something.' This is to say: once there is a thing, the things it gives rise to are endless. Thus, 'yet there is indeed something without end.'

Such passages exemplify the subtlety of the text.

The sage’s love for others leaves visible traces. The ceaseless pursuit of forms and descriptions arises from taking 'something' as its basis, unaware that what gives rise to things is not itself a thing.

Yan Yuan asked Confucius: 'I once heard you say, "Do not send off, do not welcome." May I ask about the wandering therein?' Confucius said: 'The ancients transformed externally while remaining untransformed internally; people today transform internally while remaining untransformed externally. One who transforms with things is one who does not transform. At peace with transformation and non-transformation, at peace in mingling with them, one must be without excess.

The parks of Xiwei, the gardens of the Yellow Emperor, the palaces of Youyu, the halls of Tang and Wu—these are the masters of the Confucians and Mohists, who thus engage in mutual disputation. How much more so for people today?'

The sage engages with things without harming them; one who does no harm to things is one whom things cannot harm. Only one who is free from harm can truly send off and welcome others. To be without sending off and without welcoming is to be without a mind attached to things. Responding to things without being burdened by them is external transformation; responding to stimuli without stirring the heart is internal non-transformation. Thus it is said: "The ancients transformed externally while remaining untransformed internally." To engage in contention, daily battling with the heart, is internal transformation. To struggle and clash with things, being inwardly enslaved by them, is external non-transformation. Thus it is said: "People today transform internally while remaining untransformed externally." When one’s unchanging inner self externally responds to things, what passes becomes transformed without sending off or welcoming—so transformed, one knows not transformation; untransformed, one knows not non-transformation. Thus it is said: "One who transforms with things is one who does not transform." To be at peace with transformation and non-transformation—this "one who does not transform" is a mind without mind. *An* means "how." *Xiangmi* means mutual grinding; *mi* is the same as *mo*. *An yu* means "how can one." *Duo* means seeking excess; seeking excess is striving to surpass, while *mo duo* means not seeking to surpass. "Must not seek to surpass" means that one of the utmost Dao does not contend with things by seeking excess.

Xiwei, the Yellow Emperor, Youyu, Tang, and Wu—masters of the Confucians and Mohists—all failed to fully embody the principle of internal non-transformation, thus descending into disputes over right and wrong. *Xi* signifies that they still engaged in contention over right and wrong. Only when the five flavors clash can harmony be achieved; thus it is said they "contend." Comparing Xiwei and those who followed to the Confucians and Mohists implies a critique of the latter’s lesser attainment. Parks, gardens, palaces, and halls refer to their being trapped in fixed patterns. Not harming things means transforming with them; having transformed with things, things cannot harm one, for one is unburdened. Only with an unburdened heart can one truly send off and welcome others. The earlier statement "without sending off and without welcoming" and this one "sending off and welcoming others" express the meaning of "non-action yet nothing left undone," and "not treating things as things yet treating all things as things."

Mountains and forests, marshes and wilds—these bring me joy, joy unbounded. Yet before joy is complete, sorrow follows; sorrow and joy come, and I cannot resist them; they depart, and I cannot halt them. How pitiful are the people of this world, mere lodging-houses for things! Those who know what they encounter yet do not know what they do not encounter, who know what they can do yet cannot do what they cannot—this lack of knowledge and ability is something no person can avoid. Yet those who strive to avoid what no one can avoid—how tragic indeed!

Ultimate words transcend words, thus "ultimate words abandon words." Ultimate action transcends action, thus "ultimate action abandons action." To equate what one knows with all that can be known is shallow; thus it is said: "To level knowledge with what is known." *Qi* means "to equate," like "all." When people wander among mountains, forests, marshes, and wilds, they begin with joy, but joy inevitably gives rise to emotion, and emotion to sorrow. The *Lanting Record* employs precisely this idea. Joy and sorrow arise from things, coming and going beyond my control—thus this heart of mine is but an inn for sorrow and joy. This speaks of lacking an inner master, being moved by things.

What is encountered is visible; what is not encountered is invisible. The visible is human; the invisible is Heaven. What one can do is human; what one cannot is Heaven. All people in the world have what they do not know and cannot do. Since this is unavoidable for all, it is said: "Lack of knowledge and ability is something no person can avoid." Only by knowing the human and not knowing the Heavenly do people exert their minds and intelligence, seeking to avoid what cannot be avoided—how tragic indeed! Ultimate words are wordless, hence "ultimate words abandon words." Ultimate action is actionless, hence "ultimate action abandons action." Not knowing what cannot be known, yet taking what can be known as knowledge—this is shallow insight; thus it is said: "To level knowledge with what is known." *Qi* means "to equate," like "all."

The "Miscellaneous Chapters: Gengsang Chu" of the *Nanhua True Classic*

Among the followers of Lao Dan was one named Gengsang Chu, who had partially grasped the Dao of Lao Dan. He dwelt in the north upon Mount Weilěi. Those among his servants who were clever and discerning departed; those among his concubines who were pure and benevolent kept their distance. Only the dull and clumsy remained, and the restless and burdened served him.

After three years, Weilěi enjoyed great abundance. The people of Weilěi said to one another: "When Master Gengsang first arrived, we found him uncommonly refined. Now, when we reckon our days, we find them insufficient, but when we reckon our years, we find them abundant. He must be a sage! Why do we not together offer him sacrifices as to an ancestral spirit, and worship him as we do the gods of soil and grain?"

Gengsang Chu heard of this and, facing south, was displeased. His disciples found this strange. Gengsang Chu said: "Disciples, why do you find me strange? When the spring *qi* arises, the hundred grasses grow; when autumn arrives in due season, the myriad treasures ripen. Is it not the Dao that brings this about? The Great Way has already unfolded. I have heard that the perfected person dwells like a corpse within a walled chamber, while the common people run wildly about, not knowing where to turn. Now, among the petty folk of Weilěi, there are those who secretly wish to place me among the vessels of the worthy. Am I one to be measured by such standards? This is why I am displeased with the words of Lao Dan."

*Yi* (役) means "follower." *Menren* (门人) means "disciple." *Piande* (偏得) means "to grasp partially." *Chen* (臣) means "servant." *Zhouran* (昼然) conveys the sense of clarity and discernment; *xieran* (絜然), the sense of gentle kindness. *Yongzhong* (拥肿) means dull and unrefined; *yangzhang* (鞅掌), restless and burdened. *Saran yi zhi* (洒然异之) means they found him uncommonly refined and different from others. *Sui ji you yu* (岁计有余) means that over time, benefits became apparent.

The "spirit-mediums of altars and grain" serve merely as terms of reverent sacrifice, with all four characters bearing equal weight—such phrasing reveals the rhythmic vitality of his brush. "Facing south" necessarily describes the direction of one’s dwelling. *Bu shiran* means displeasure. That the *Spring and Autumn* achieved what it did was ordained by Heaven; thus it is said, "How could it have been otherwise?" The Great Dao has already been enacted—the Great Dao being the natural order—a metaphor for spontaneity without intent.

To dwell like a corpse within a walled chamber while entrusting oneself to the wild abandon of the people, becoming one with them, is to remain unaware of one’s own conduct; hence it is said, "The common people run wildly about, not knowing where to turn." *Ru* also means "to go." This speaks of forgetting the world. *Zu dou* is akin to "position" or "rank." *Shao* refers to a small vessel. If I am shallow and easily perceived, others may come to know me—much like the Buddhist saying, "My cultivation lacks strength, and so the spirits see through me." To be displeased with the words of Lao Dan is to fear failing my teacher’s instruction and thus feel uneasy.

The disciple said: "It is not so."

The ordinary ditch is too narrow for a great fish to turn its body, so the minnows and loaches dominate it; the modest hill of a few paces is too small for a massive beast to conceal itself, so the fox and wildcat claim it as their omen. Moreover, honoring the worthy and entrusting the capable, bestowing goodness and benefit—this has been the way since the time of Yao and Shun, let alone the people of Weilei. You should listen to this.

Gengsangzi said: "Come, my disciple. The beast that leaves the mountain in its armored carriage will not escape the snares and nets; the fish that swallows boats, once stranded from the water, will be tormented by ants. Thus, birds and beasts do not tire of the heights, and fish and turtles do not tire of the depths. For one who preserves their form and life, concealing their person, there is no depth too profound.

And yet, what are those two worth praising? In their disputations, it is like recklessly chiseling at walls to plant mugwort and thistles—combing one’s hair strand by strand, measuring rice grain by grain to cook. How could such petty efforts ever save the world? Promote the worthy, and the people will contend; rely on cunning, and the people will steal. These methods are not enough to enrich the people. The people toil relentlessly for profit—sons kill fathers, ministers kill rulers, thieves rob in broad daylight, and at noon, they bore through walls. I tell you, the root of great chaos arises between Yao and Shun, and its legacy will not vanish for a thousand generations. A thousand generations hence, there will surely be men who devour one another.

Though the minnow and loach are small, they rule the ordinary ditch; though the fox and wildcat are small, they rule the modest hill. This means that no place, great or small, lacks its lords. 'Bestowing goodness and benefit' means that when fame arises, profit follows. In the time of Yao and Shun, it was the same with the worthy and capable—when a person possessed the virtue of worthiness, others would revere them. Though Weilei is small, its reverence for the worthy is no different from ancient times. You ought to heed this.

The beast that swallows carriages, when isolated, cannot escape harm; the fish that swallows boats, when adrift from water, is vulnerable to ants. This is a metaphor for how fame in the world endangers one’s person. 'Preserving form and life' refers to long life and enduring vision. 'Concealing one’s person without tiring of depth' means desiring to withdraw from the world without renown. The 'two' refer to Yao and Shun. To cite Yao and Shun in debate is like trying to plant grass on a wall—it is impossible, meaning their examples are misapplied. 'Combing hair strand by strand, measuring rice grain by grain' describes their petty, meticulous concerns. Promote the noble, and the people will compete; rely on knowledge, and the people will grow deceitful. These methods cannot enrich the people. 'The people toil relentlessly for profit' means they suffer greatly for survival. *Re* means 'wall.' Boring through walls at noon is to steal in broad daylight. 'A thousand generations hence, there will surely be men who devour one another' means that the world’s decay began with Yao and Shun."

Nanrong Chu sat upright and said: "At my age, I am already old. How can I entrust myself to learning to attain such teachings?"

Gengsangzi said: "Preserve your form, embrace your life, and do not let your thoughts and worries run wild. If you do this for three years, you can attain these words."

Nanrong Chu said: "The eyes and the body—I do not see them as different, yet the blind cannot see themselves; the ears and the body—I do not see them as different, yet the deaf cannot hear themselves; the heart and the body—I do not see them as different, yet the mad cannot grasp themselves. The body and the body are open to one another, yet something intervenes, so that though I seek to unite them, I cannot. Now you tell me to preserve my form, embrace my life, and not let my thoughts and worries run wild. I have striven to hear the Dao and reach understanding."

Gengsangzi said: "My words are exhausted. The fleeing bee cannot transform the giant caterpillar; the Yue chicken cannot hatch the swan’s egg, though the Lu chicken certainly can. Chickens are chickens—their virtue is not different, yet some can and some cannot, for their talents are inherently great or small. My talent is small and insufficient to transform you. Why not go south to see Laozi?"

"Entrusting oneself to learning" means receiving instruction. "Attaining these words" means reaching the teachings of Gengsangzi. Though all possess human form, their hearts, ears, and eyes are the same—hence, "I do not see them as different." Yet the mad, though they have this heart, cannot grasp themselves, just as the blind and deaf cannot see or hear. *Pi* means "open." My form and others’ forms are all open and unobstructed, yet I am hindered by worldly desires. I seek the heart with the heart, but it grows ever more elusive—hence, "though I seek to unite them, I cannot." As I pursue the heart in vain, you tell me not to let my thoughts and worries run wild. If I strive diligently in this, perhaps I may yet attain understanding.

Nanrong Chu’s words show no path to liberation. Gengsangzi, wishing to further enlighten him but not having exhausted his own words, directs him to see Laozi, saying, "My words are exhausted." This is a humble pretense, not a true lack of words. The fleeing bee is a small bee; the *huozhu* is a large insect in beans. The Yue chicken is small, the Lu chicken large, and the swan is also a large bird. The small bee cannot enchant the giant caterpillar; the small chicken cannot hatch the large egg. This is a metaphor for his limited power, which cannot enlighten you. Thus, he sends him to see Laozi.

Nanrong Chu packed provisions and, after seven days and nights, arrived at Laozi’s abode.

Laozi said, "Have you come from the land of Chu?"
Nanrong Chu replied, "Indeed."

Laozi said, "Why have you brought so many people with you?"
Nanrong Chu, startled, looked behind him. Laozi said, "Do you not understand what I mean?"

Nanrong Chu bowed his head for a moment, then looked up and sighed, saying, "Now I have forgotten my answer and thus lost my question."

Laozi said, "What do you mean?"

Nanrong Chu said, "If I am ignorant, people call me stubbornly foolish; if I know, it only brings sorrow to my body. If I am unkind, I harm others; if I am kind, it only brings sorrow to myself. If I am unjust, I injure others; if I am just, it only brings sorrow to my own self. How can I escape this? These three dilemmas are what trouble me. I wish to ask you about them through my coming from Chu."

Laozi said, "Earlier, I saw between your brows that I had already grasped your state. Now you speak, and it confirms it. You are like one who has lost his parents, holding up a pole to search for them in the sea. You are a lost man—bewildered and forlorn. You wish to return to your true nature but have no way in. How pitiful!"

Nanrong Chu, seeking to enter and rest, summoned what he loved and cast aside what he hated. For ten days he grieved alone, then saw Laozi again.

Laozi said, "You have cleansed yourself—why then are you still so troubled? Yet within, you still brim with what you detest. One who is bound externally cannot be tightly grasped, for he will turn inward to secure himself. One who is bound internally cannot be twistedly grasped, for he will turn outward to secure himself. If one so bound cannot even hold fast to virtue and power, how much less can one who wanders from the Way and acts freely?"

Nanrong Chu said, "When a villager falls ill, his neighbors ask after him, and the sick man can describe his illness. Yet though he speaks of his sickness, he remains unwell. When I hear of the great Dao, it is like taking medicine that only worsens my illness. I wish only to hear the principles of preserving life."

Laozi said, "The principles of preserving life—can you embrace the One? Can you not lose it? Can you know good and ill fortune without divination? Can you stop? Can you cease? Can you abandon seeking in others and seek within yourself? Can you be carefree? Can you be uncontrived? Can you be like a child? A child may cry all day, yet his throat does not grow hoarse—such is the perfection of harmony."

All day long he grasps yet his hand does not stiffen—such is the sharing of his power. All day long he gazes yet his eyes do not blink—his focus lies not without. In movement he knows not where he goes; at rest he knows not what he does. He flows with things, riding their waves—this is the principle of preserving life.

When a sick man is still able to describe his illness, his sickness is not yet severe. When illness grows severe, he can no longer speak. Now I wish to hear of the great Dao yet do not know where I am afflicted—so deep is my confusion and delusion. Though there be teachings to instruct me, they only deepen my bewilderment, and thus I say it is like taking medicine that worsens the illness. Now I dare not ask for further instruction; I wish only to learn the Way of preserving life.

To "embrace the One" is to preserve its purity. To "not lose it" is to keep what one receives from Heaven without loss. To "know good and ill fortune without divination" is to know beforehand through the Way of perfect sincerity. To "stop" is to be settled. To "cease" is what the Śākya tradition calls "great rest." To "abandon seeking in others and seek within oneself" is to turn from externals and attend to what is within.

"Carefree" describes being without encumbrance. "Uncontrived" describes being without pretense. To "be like a child" is to retain the heart of an infant. *Hao* means to cry; *ya* means the throat; *sha* means hoarseness. An infant may cry all day without growing hoarse, for it harms not its harmony by deliberate effort.

*Nie* means to be bent and unable to straighten. A man’s hand, if clenched too long, will resist when he tries to open it, but a child’s hand is not so—such is its natural disposition. "Sharing" means together. "Power" means inherent nature.

The eye gazes without blinking, yet though it sees, it sees nothing—it does not yet know external things. To know external things is to be partial.

*Xuān* is the same as blinking. To walk without knowing where one goes, to dwell without knowing what one does—this is to speak of being without mind.

*Wei-yi* means to follow and comply. Whether walking or dwelling, one moves in accord with things. *Bo* means to flow. To be "of the same wave" is to go along with things.

Such is the constant principle of preserving life, and thus it is called "the warp of life-preservation."

Nan Rong Chu said: "Then is this the virtue of the perfected person?"

He replied: "No. This is what is called 'water melting, ice dissolving.' As for the perfected person: they share sustenance with the earth and share joy with heaven. They do not let the gains and harms of people and things disturb them, nor do they conspire in strangeness, nor scheme together, nor act in concert. They go carefree, they come uncontrived—this is called 'the warp of life-preservation.'"

He said: "Then is this perfection?"

He replied: "Not yet."

"I have already told you: can you be like an infant? The infant moves without knowing what it does, walks without knowing where it goes. Its body is like the branch of a withered tree, its heart like dead ashes. In such a state, misfortune does not arrive, nor does fortune come. With neither misfortune nor fortune, how could there be human calamity?

Chu asked about the warp of life-preservation, seeking something secondary. Yet upon hearing Laozi’s words so profound, he then inquired about the virtue of the perfected person. This question was reasonable, but Laozi again said ‘No,’ fearing he might cling to this and make it a fixed pattern—what the Buddhists call ‘taking the provisional as real.’ ‘Ice dissolving, frost melting’ means awakening as if sobering from drunkenness.

‘Sharing sustenance with the earth’ is to be one with others; ‘sharing joy with heaven’ is to be one with heaven. *Jiao* means ‘together’ or ‘the same.’ *Xiangying* means to clash or collide. ‘Conspiring in strangeness’ means pursuing the unusual. ‘Scheming together’ means having no calculating mind. ‘Acting in concert’ means leaving no trace of deliberate action.

He then says, ‘This is the warp of life-preservation.’ Earlier, he spoke of ‘the perfected person,’ and now he speaks of ‘life-preservation,’ implying that the Way of life-preservation is the affair of the perfected person. Seen thus, the earlier ‘No’ was clearly not an absolute denial.

Chu, having heard this, then asked, ‘Then is this perfection?’—meaning this Way is the ultimate Way. Yet Laozi again said, ‘Not yet.’ If he truly meant ‘not yet,’ there should have been further explanation, but instead he returned to his earlier question, ‘Can you be like an infant?’—suggesting that even ‘not yet’ was not an absolute statement.

‘With neither misfortune nor fortune’ means transcending the realm of fortune and misfortune. ‘Human calamity’ refers to the afflictions of worldly concerns. If I have already transcended fortune and misfortune, then I have departed far from the world—how could there be worldly afflictions?

The replies ‘No’ and ‘Not yet’ were not meant to exhaust the truth but to lead him toward self-realization. This is a method often used in Chan Buddhism."

One whose cosmos is at peace emits the radiance of Heaven. To emit the radiance of Heaven is to be perceived by others as one who has become one with Heaven. Those who cultivate themselves thus attain constancy; those who attain constancy are embraced by others and aided by Heaven. What others embrace is called the people of Heaven; what Heaven aids is called the child of Heaven.

The learner learns what cannot be learned; the practitioner practices what cannot be practiced; the debater debates what cannot be debated. To know where to halt at what cannot be known—this is perfection. Should one deviate from this, the balance of Heaven will undo it.

Hereafter, Zhuangzi expounds the supreme principle in general terms. "Cosmos" refers to the chest. When one is serene and settled, the radiance of Heaven manifests—this is sincerity becoming illumination. Thus, "one whose cosmos is at peace emits the radiance of Heaven." Once the radiance of Heaven shines forth, though others may perceive one as merely human, one has already become one with Heaven.

Those who cultivate themselves are cultivators of the real. When such cultivators reach the point where the radiance of Heaven shines forth, they attain constancy. Constancy means duration—this is the enduring sincerity of utmost truth. When utmost sincerity endures, Heaven aids it, and others return to it. "Embrace" means to rest or return. The people of Heaven are the people of Heaven—those who are no ordinary persons. The child of Heaven is one whom Heaven cherishes as its child.

Learning, practicing, and debating all leave traces; what cannot be learned, practiced, or debated is the natural. When one’s knowledge reaches its limit at what cannot be known, this is the ultimate attainment. The balance of Heaven is the workings of creation. To "deviate from this" is to fail to conform. To fail to conform is to oppose it, thereby losing the principle of creation’s spontaneity. "Undo" means to lose.

To prepare things to nurture form, to conceal the unforeseen to give rise to the mind, to revere the center to reach the external—if, having done all this, myriad evils still arise, they are of Heaven, not of man. They are insufficient to disturb one’s perfect integrity. They cannot enter the numinous terrace.

The "numinous terrace" is the mind. To "not admit into the numinous terrace" means external things do not enter the mind. External things do not enter the mind, so they cannot disturb one’s integrity. "To have hold" means to have a master. "Not knowing what one holds" means that though one has a master, one does not know what one masters—this is transformation through vastness. "What cannot be held" means that if one holds to something, one has not yet transformed. These three instances of "hold" are most subtly expressed and must not be read carelessly.

If one does not see the sincerity within oneself manifesting, every manifestation will be inappropriate. Once karma enters and is not relinquished, each change will result in loss. To do evil in the open, others will punish it; to do evil in secret, ghosts will punish it. Only when one is enlightened about others and enlightened about ghosts can one walk alone.

These several lines again speak of those who do evil, who have not perfected themselves yet act. "To act" is to act recklessly. Reckless action leads to every matter being inappropriate. Once karma has entered, though one knows it, one cannot relinquish it—this is the shame of error and the commission of wrong. "Change" means to alter. To feel shame for error and commit wrong, each alteration only reveals further mistakes. Thus, "each change results in loss." "Karma" also means affairs; today, people say "karma has already taken shape" or "karma is already thus"—this is the meaning of "karma."

Such a person’s conduct is already not good; if not punished by others, they will be held accountable by ghosts. This speaks of the unseen and seen—there is nowhere to escape. If one knows the awe-inspiring nature of the unseen and seen, one can be cautious in solitude. Thus, "enlightened about others, enlightened about ghosts, only then can one walk alone." This is the same as "nothing is more visible than the obscure, nothing more manifest than the subtle; thus the noble person is cautious in solitude." "Walking alone" is being cautious in solitude. Such lines could well be included in the classics.

Those within the contract act without seeking fame; those outside the contract aspire to extravagant expenditure. To act without seeking fame is to be steadfast and radiant; to aspire to extravagant expenditure is to be like a merchant—others see them as towering, like a mound. One who exhausts things enters into them; one who merely engages with things cannot even contain themselves—how can they contain others? One who cannot contain others has no intimacy; one who has no intimacy is forsaken by all.

Those within the contract seek what lies within their allotted portion—this is what Mencius meant by "seek and you shall obtain it, for what is sought lies within." "Without fame" means others cannot name it. Those outside the contract seek what lies without. Those who pursue external things set their aspirations on nothing more than resources for expenditure—this is seeking for self-benefit. "Steadfast and radiant" means to be replete and luminous. "Steadfast" means constant; radiance is ever-present.

Abandoning the self to seek externals, with the mind set on gaining profit—this is the intent of merchants, hence it is said: "only merchants do so." *Qi* (跂) describes a lofty, self-standing appearance. People see only externals—wealth or rank surpassing others—and thus regard them as towering and worthy of reverence, unaware that they are bound to desires from beginning to end, exhausting themselves without cease. Their very being is submerged in desire, thus it is said: "one who exhausts things enters into them; things enter into them." *Qie* (且) means "merely" or "temporarily." *Zhu* (逐) means to chase after things. Those who pursue gains with such temporary attachment, even to the point of losing themselves without regret, are said to "merely engage with things," and thus "cannot even contain themselves." If one cannot contain oneself, how can one contain others? With such an inability to embrace others, even kin and flesh-and-blood relations grow distant and estranged, hence it is said: "one who cannot contain others has no intimacy; one who has no intimacy is forsaken by all."

Observe these lines—how could Zhuangzi not comprehend worldly dharmas? "No weapon is more cruel than the will; even *Moye* blades are inferior. No foe is greater than yin and yang, from which there is no escape between heaven and earth." It is not yin and yang that harm one, but the heart that invites it. *Zhi* (志), or will, is the heart’s attachment. Any attachment of the heart can injure the self, and no self-harm is crueler than this—will is even more severe than the *Moye* blade, hence it is said: "no weapon is more cruel than the will; even *Moye* blades are inferior." The qi of yin and yang can harm a person, like a bandit, yet if the heart remains balanced, how can yin and yang cause harm? Thus it is said: "it is not yin and yang that harm one, but the heart that invites it." This is what is meant by "its heat scorches like fire, its cold congeals like ice." These two lines are excellent; in the practice of heart-learning, this teaching is most incisive.

"The Dao is all-pervading—whether in allotment, completion, or destruction." What is despised in allotment is its tendency toward exhaustiveness. What is despised in exhaustiveness is its reliance on having. Completion and destruction are two distinct matters, but from the perspective of the Dao, they are one and the same. Thus it is said: "the Dao is all-pervading—whether in allotment." Once the human heart divides self from other, it inevitably seeks exhaustiveness for its private ends, hence it is said: "its allotment tends toward exhaustiveness." All things return to nothingness, yet those who cling to exhaustiveness seek only to possess. Those who understand the Dao despise this, hence it is said: "what is despised in exhaustiveness is its reliance on having."

"To depart without returning is to become a ghost." To "depart and obtain this" means to attain death. One who responds to externals yet returns to the internal attains virtue; attaining virtue, one becomes spirit-like and celestial. But one who chases externals without returning sinks into the realm of ghosts, hence it is said: "to depart without returning is to become a ghost." As the Buddhists say, "the ghostly den’s livelihood"—this is precisely it.

"Without affirmation or negation, this heart remains ever-alive; clinging to right and wrong without transformation, this heart is dead." "To depart and obtain this" refers to being enslaved by externals and acquiring self-righteous views. *The Equality of Things* says, "a heart near death cannot be revived"—this is the same idea. "To extinguish yet possess reality—this is one with ghosts." Those with form model themselves on the formless to attain certainty. *Shi* (实), or reality, is the true principle within heaven and earth. Without the heart, there is emptiness; in emptiness, there is reality. But if one extinguishes with a selfish heart and takes possession as reality, then one is no different from a ghost, hence it is said: "to extinguish yet possess reality—this is one with ghosts." Those who sink into ghostly realms all extinguish principle with selfish hearts, clinging to existence while ignorant of true emptiness and real being. If one can perceive the formless within the formed, then principle is made certain. *Xiang* (象) means "to resemble." The Buddhists say, "one may empty all that exists, but must not reify what does not"—this is the same idea.

"Emerging without origin, entering without aperture—real yet without location." *Chu* (出), or emergence, is birth, the beginning of all things. Though it has no origin, it cannot be known, hence it is said: "without origin." *Ru* (入), or entry, is death, the end of all things. Though one may know its end, one cannot see where it enters, hence it is said: "without aperture." Though true principle exists, it cannot be sought in any fixed place, hence it is said: "real yet without location."

"Having duration yet without beginning or end—what emerges has no aperture, yet is real." That which is real yet without location is *yu* (宇), space. That which has duration yet no beginning or end is *zhou* (宙), time. There is life, there is death; there is emergence, there is entry. Emergence and entry leave no visible trace—this is called the Gate of Heaven.

The following explains the three preceding lines. Principle exists in past and present, unchanged for thousands upon thousands of years, hence it is said: "having duration." Yet its beginning and end are unseen, hence it is said: "without beginning or end." *Ben* (本) is the start; *piao* (剽) is the end. Laozi said, "empty yet inexhaustible, the more it moves, the more it emerges—though it emerges endlessly, it cannot be exhausted." Its aperture is empty; emptiness is the very source of reality, hence it is said: "what emerges has no aperture, yet is real." Emergence and entry are one—this explains the character *ru* (入) by saying "what emerges," revealing the intended meaning.

*Yu* (宇) is the four directions and above and below. The Dao has no fixed location—all directions and dimensions are its domain, hence it is called *yu*. This is like the kite soaring in the sky and the fish leaping in the abyss, signifying its pervasiveness in all directions. *Zhou* (宙) is past and present. The Dao’s passage through thousands of years remains ever thus—this is *zhou*. Life is emergence; death is entry. Life, death, emergence, and entry all have their source, yet no visible form—this is the marvel of creation. The Gate of Heaven is creation itself, the natural order. Since the text speaks of emergence and entry, it concludes with the word *men* (门), "gate."

The Gate of Heaven is Non-Being. All things emerge from Non-Being. Being cannot make Being from Being—it must emerge from Non-Being, and this Non-Being is itself a Non-Being. The sage conceals himself therein.

Being does not arise from Being but from Non-Being. Thus it is said, "Being cannot make Being from Being—it must emerge from Non-Being." Yet this Non-Being is itself a singular Non-Being, hence "there is no Non-Being within Non-Being." The *Qiwu* [Equalizing Things] chapter says: "There is Being and Non-Being," and "there is that which has never begun to have Non-Being"—this is the same meaning. "Concealing" means withdrawing into secrecy. The sage’s heart conceals itself in Non-Being, thus "he conceals himself therein."

The ancients’ knowledge reached its utmost. How far did it reach? Some held that there had never yet been any thing—this was the utmost, the exhaustion of all possibility, beyond which nothing could be added. The next held that things existed, regarding life as loss and death as return, thus making distinctions. Still others said that originally there was Non-Being, then came life, and life swiftly turned to death, taking Non-Being as the head, life as the body, and death as the tail. Whoever knows that Being, Non-Being, death, and life are one and the same—I befriend them. Though these three differ, they belong to the same clan: the Zhaos and Jings, distinguished by office; the Dais, distinguished by duty; and the Jias, distinguished by fief. They are not one.

The beginning of Non-Being, the end of life and death, the cycle of beginning and end—these have no divisions. The next level introduces the names of life and death. "Loss" is sojourning. The *Qiwu* speaks of "weakness and loss without knowing return"—to regard life as loss is to see it as a temporary dwelling in the world. To regard death as return is to speak of returning to truth. Once life and death are divided, things exist, hence "thus distinctions are made."

The highest level is Non-Being—the primordial state of the Great Ultimate. The next level is Being—the division of yin and yang. The next says there is life, and with life comes the self. Though one knows the self, one still regards death and life, Being and Non-Being as one—this is knowing their distinction yet also knowing their non-distinction. Though these three have an order, none depart from the Dao. They are like a noble clan divided into three branches, yet sharing the same surname. The Zhaos and Jings are distinguished by their offices; the Jias by their fiefs. *Dai* means duty or office. Though the Zhaos, Jings, and Jias are not one family, they are all noble clans of Chu. Above, it says the three differ yet share the same clan, then concludes with "they are not one" beneath the word "also"—this seamless yet unbroken structure is the subtlety of the text.

"Having life" is *yǎn hù miè fǎn* (黬户灭反). To rashly say "this shifts" is to speak of what should not be spoken. Yet it remains unknowable. *Yǎn* means soot, the blackness at the bottom of a cauldron, or a blemish—here it signifies the coagulation of qi. When the qi of heaven and earth coalesces into a person, it is a sickness of primordial qi. Earlier, it spoke of life as "stifled breath"—this is the same meaning. Human life arises from this same qi, yet people forcibly make distinctions, hence "rashly." *Rashly* means to divide. Once distinctions are made, each clings to their own, and in clinging to their own, each asserts their own "this," yet what is called "this" shifts. *Shifts* means instability. That has its right and wrong, this has its right and wrong—this is shifting. The meaning aligns with the *Qiwu* chapter, yet it coins the term "shifting this."

"Not to be spoken" means it should not be spoken. The theory of "shifting this" should not be spoken by anyone, for to speak it is to be partial. Though each person has their own "this," what they affirm is unstable, hence "though this is so, it is unknowable."

The sacrificial victim has its *pì* (百叶) and *hǎi* (胲)—it can be dispersed yet cannot be dispersed. *Là* is the sacrifice. *Pì* is the cow’s omasum. *Hǎi* is the toes. They are parts of the same sacrificial animal. When the sacrifice is performed, the animal is slaughtered, its limbs and organs arranged on the altar—this is called "dispersed." Yet though dispersed, the sacrifice remains one thing; though not dispersed, its organs and limbs are already divided among the vessels. This is like the shifting of what people call "this."

To observe a house is to encompass its chambers and ancestral halls, and to visit its resting places—this illustrates "shifting this." Within one house there are chambers, ancestral halls, and places of rest. To call them chambers, halls, or resting places is to name them differently, yet to call them a house is to unite them. This is like the instability of "shifting this." These two examples are metaphors for "shifting this." *Jǔ* means "all." Observing the sacrifice and the house, what is called "this" is always shifting and unstable, hence "this illustrates 'shifting this.'"

Let me speak of "shifting this." Taking life as the root, knowledge as the teacher, one rides upon right and wrong, resulting in names and realities. Taking oneself as the standard, one makes others follow one’s own measures, and even dies to uphold them. Those who do so use action as wisdom, inaction as foolishness, thoroughness as fame, and failure as shame. "Shifting this" describes people today—the cicada and the quail are the same in their sameness.

Having concluded above, it returns to the term "shifting this." "Taking life as the root" means that once there is "this," life is taken as the root. Using the knowledge one possesses as a teacher, one then rides upon right and wrong—what is name, what is reality? Thus it is said, "resulting in names and realities."

"When it says 'resulting in,' it means that this is not necessarily so. *Zhi* (质) means 'root.' Taking one’s own knowledge as the teacher and this as the root, one demands that others follow one’s own measures—thus it is said, 'taking oneself as the standard, making others follow one’s own measures.' Precisely because of this self-centeredness, disputes over right and wrong are willingly settled even by death—hence, 'dying to uphold them.' The latter *jie* (节, 'measures') arises from the former *jie* (节, 'uphold'). Only thus do distinctions of wisdom and foolishness, honor and shame emerge in matters of action and inaction, success and failure. People today all 'shift this'—hence, 'shifting this describes people today.' *Che* (彻) means 'thorough.' The cicada and the quail both mock the great Peng, just as those who 'shift this' ridicule the person of perfect Dao, their vision no different from that of the cicada and quail. The cicada and quail are the same, and people are again the same as the cicada and quail—hence, 'the same in their sameness.' This is stirring prose.

If you tread on a stranger’s foot in the marketplace, you apologize with deference, fearing their anger. If an elder brother treads on his younger brother’s foot, he merely scolds him, without apology, for their bond is close and no thanks are needed. If parents tread on their child’s foot, not even a scolding is given—their intimacy is so profound that mutual understanding is natural. 'In perfect ritual, there is no distinction between self and other'—the highest ritual forgets formalities of bowing and yielding. 'In perfect righteousness, things are not treated as things'—the highest righteousness does not measure appropriateness by external objects. 'Perfect wisdom does not scheme'—it requires no deliberation. 'Perfect benevolence has no favorites'—no trace of partial affection is seen. 'Perfect trust dispenses with collateral'—it does not rely on gold or treasure as security. *Pi* (辟) is read as *ping* (屏), meaning 'to remove.' The analogy of treading on feet is set forth for the five principles of ritual, righteousness, and the rest that follow.

Dispel the turbulence of the will, untangle the delusions of the mind, cast off the burdens of virtue, and clear the blockages of the Way. Wealth, honor, prominence, prestige, fame, and profit—these six disturb the will. Appearance, movement, countenance, speech, qi, and intent—these six entangle the mind. Aversion, desire, joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—these six burden virtue. Withdrawal, approach, taking, giving, knowledge, and ability—these six obstruct the Way. If these four sets of six are not stirred within the breast, one is upright; being upright, one is still; being still, one is clear; being clear, one is empty; being empty, one acts without acting and yet nothing is left undone. *Che* (彻) is the same as *sa* (撒), meaning 'to explain.' *Xian* (显) means 'conspicuous glory.' *Yan* (严) means 'dignity.' 'Turbulence of the will' means these six can confuse one’s resolve. *Dong* (动) means 'conduct.' *Li* (理) means 'reasoning in speech.' 'Delusions of the mind' means these six can entangle and bind the mind. 'Burdens of virtue' means that when emotions prevail, they encumber one’s innate truth. *Zhi* (知) means 'discernment.' *Neng* (能) means 'talent.' 'Blockages of the Way' means obstacles to the Way. *Dang* (荡) means 'to disturb.' Removing these four sets of six harms—turbulence of the will, delusions of the mind, burdens of virtue, and blockages of the Way—prevents disturbance within the breast. This is where one applies effort.

The Way is the reverence of virtue; life is the radiance of virtue..."

Nature is the essence of life. The movement of nature is called *action*; the artificiality of action is called *loss*. *Knowledge* is response; *knowledge* is planning. What the knower does not know is like a sidelong glance. Movement through inevitability is called *virtue*; movement without self is called *order*—their names oppose each other, yet their realities align.

*Reverence* is holding fast with respect. *Life* is the manifestation of virtue; in manifestation, there is radiance. *Nature* is what lies within me. *Essence* is the original state. When nature moves, there is action; when action flows into human artifice, it becomes the loss of nature. *Response* is correspondence. *Planning* is deliberation. From response to deliberation, all are the knowledge within nature. Here, the meaning of these words differs from that in the *Analects* and *Mencius*—read *Zhuangzi* through *Zhuangzi*, without rigid adherence.

An infant’s gaze, seeing nothing, is called a sidelong glance; the knower, claiming knowledge of the unknown, is like the infant’s glance. This aligns with the meaning of *"the wise act without contrivance."* All movement and use arise from inevitability—this is called *virtue*, which is the forgetting of self. Within this forgetting, there is nothing that is not the self—this is the form within the formless, the formless within form. *Order* is peace; that which nothing can disturb is called *order*. Though *virtue* and *order*, *inevitability* and *selflessness* seem opposed in name, their realities never fail to align—this is another way of speaking.

Yi excelled at hitting the subtlest mark yet was clumsy at preventing others from praising him; the sage excels at the Way of Heaven yet is clumsy in human affairs. Only the *whole person* can excel at Heaven and be adept in human matters. Only creatures can be creatures; only creatures can follow Heaven. The *whole person* detests Heaven, detests the Heaven in others—how much more the Heaven or humanity in oneself!

*Subtle* means refined. Archery that hits the most refined mark is called *hitting the subtle*. Yi’s inability to prevent others from praising him is like the sage’s inability to escape the world’s renown. *Excelling at Heaven* means fully embodying the Way of Heaven. *Clumsy in human affairs* means concealing oneself among people. *Liang* (俍) is pronounced like *good* and means *skill* or *ability*. The *whole person* is one of complete virtue. *Creature* is the general term for birds, beasts, and all things. Though each thing is small, it possesses what Heaven has granted—whether flying, running, crying, spouting, calling, or leaping—all fulfill their Heaven-given nature, hence *"only creatures can be creatures; only creatures can follow Heaven."* To call oneself a *whole person* is not to claim the name of Heaven. Where there is the name of Heaven, there is the name of humanity. Thus, the *whole person* detests Heaven. *Detests* means disliking the name. To distinguish Heaven and humanity in others is already detestable—how much more to distinguish Heaven and humanity in oneself? Hence, *"detests the Heaven in others, and how much more the Heaven or humanity in oneself."*

*"Only creatures can be creatures; only creatures can follow Heaven"*—these eight words are profoundly apt. When a sparrow encounters Yi, Yi must catch it—this is *power*. To treat the world as a cage is to leave the sparrow nowhere to escape. Thus, Tang used a cook to cage Yi Yin, and Duke Mu of Qin used five sheepskins to cage Baili Xi. Therefore, nothing can be caged except through its desires.

The *maimed one* discards fine robes—external praise and blame mean nothing to him. The *convict laborer* climbs high without fear—he has forgotten life and death. Yi’s archery ensures the sparrow is caught, and the sparrow fears him; when the monkey sees Yang Youji, it clings to the tree and wails—this is the same idea. To treat the world as a cage is to have all sparrows within it, without needing to shoot them. The point is not Yi but to lead to the next line. This means that when people have desires, they are inevitably misled by them. Yi Yin and Baili Xi were also caged by their desires. If I have no desires, I transcend all things—who can cage me?

The *maimed one* is the amputee. *Fine robes* are ornate garments. *Discards* means to cast them off. With his feet already maimed, what use are fine robes? His heart has already cast aside praise and blame, hence *"external praise and blame mean nothing."* *Blame* here means slander. *Convict laborer* refers to those sentenced to *chengdan* or *chun* labor. As a criminal, he does not cherish his life, so he climbs high without fear. This illustrates a heart with no attachments.

To *"return repeatedly without offering"* is to forget others and become one with Heaven. *Return* means to turn back, like the *Yi Jing*’s *"returning to the Way."* *Familiar* means well-practiced. *Not offering* means not giving to others—this Way is within oneself, not a commodity. Knowing only to act for oneself without thought of others is to forget others. Forgetting others, what is within me is purely Heaven, hence *"Heavenly person."* *Familiar* is the same as *practice*. The *Xu Wu Gui* chapter says, *"I must sell it, so he sells it."* From this, one can understand the meaning of *"not offering."*

Thus, one who is revered yet not pleased, or insulted yet not angered, is one who aligns with the harmony of Heaven. Anger arises from non-anger; action arises from non-action. To calm the mind, pacify the qi; to be spirit-like, follow the heart—this is *action*. To act only from inevitability, in the manner of inevitability—this is the sage’s Way. Revered or insulted, neither brings joy nor anger, as in *"the whole world praises him yet he is not encouraged; the whole world blames him yet he is not discouraged."* *Harmony of Heaven* is the harmonious qi of creation. To align with it is to become one with it. Though anger arises, it is not anger—its origin is non-anger, a natural outpouring, not an intentional one.

Thus does one phrase illuminate the next.

The perfected person acts in the world yet holds no concerns for it—though acting, it is as though non-acting. What underlies such action arises from non-action, and this is the state of "non-action yet nothing left undone." Again, the phrasing shifts to express this.

To attain stillness, one must first pacify the qi; if the qi is not pacified, stillness cannot be achieved. To preserve the spirit whole, one must follow the heart without resistance; the slightest disturbance of the heart and the spirit is no longer whole.

In all action, to achieve rightness, one must respond only to inevitability, arising from what cannot be avoided. That which cannot be avoided is a response without intention. To respond to affairs without intention—this is the sage’s Way. Thus it is said: "what cannot be avoided, this category of things, is the sage’s Way."

How does this passage differ from the Inner Chapters? Some claim the Outer Chapters are coarse while the Inner Chapters are refined—this is mistaken.

**Miscellaneous Chapters: Xu Wugui**

Xu Wugui, through the introduction of Nü Shang, was granted an audience with Marquis Wu of Wei. The marquis greeted him, saying: "Master, you must be weary—exhausted by the toils of mountain and forest—before deigning to meet with me."

Xu Wugui replied: "It is I who am wearied by you, my lord. What weariness have you for me? If you indulge your desires and prolong your likes and dislikes, the true nature of your life and destiny will sicken. If you suppress your desires and study likes and dislikes as dualities, your ears and eyes will sicken. I weary you, my lord—what weariness have you for me?"

Marquis Wu, startled, made no reply. After a moment, Xu Wugui continued: "Let me tell you something. I judge dogs. Those of low quality stop when their bellies are full—this is the virtue of the wildcat. Those of middling quality gaze fixedly upward like one watching the sun. Those of the highest quality seem as though they have forgotten their own unity. Indulging desires and prolonging likes and dislikes severs the principle of life and destiny. Abandoning desires and likes and dislikes abruptly severs the natural function of ears and eyes—both are sickness. *Xueyinpan* means to pull back and withdraw.

The virtue of the wildcat refers to a dog of the lowest rank, whose nature is like that of a wildcat. The phrase *virtue of the wildcat* is well-placed. *Gazing at the sun* describes a dog that stares fixedly upward without blinking. *One* refers to the inherent nature of life. Such a dog lives as though dead, hence the saying: *as though it had forgotten its unity*—like a wooden chicken, this is the highest rank.

Yet my judgment of dogs is not as refined as my judgment of horses. When I judge horses, those whose straight lines meet the marking cord, whose curves fit the hook, whose angles align with the square, and whose circles match the compass—these are the state’s finest horses, though they do not compare to the horses of the world. The world’s horses possess innate talent—seeming to grieve, seeming to lose themselves, seeming to have forgotten their unity. Such horses surpass all, leaving dust in their wake, their destination unknown."

Marquis Wu was greatly pleased and laughed.

The passage about horses meeting the compass, square, marking cord, and hook describes how every part of their form accords with principle—hence the analogy of straight and curved, square and round. One need not interpret this literally as applying to the horse’s body. *Innate talent* refers to natural endowment. *Seeming to grieve, seeming to lose themselves* conveys a sense of deep absorption. *Forgotten their unity* echoes the earlier *forgotten its unity*. *Their destination unknown* means they depart without one knowing where they will stop. All these are borrowed metaphors."

Marquis Wu grasped the meaning of effortless spontaneity, and so was greatly pleased and laughed.

Xu Wugui departed. Nü Shang said, "Sir, by what means alone did you delight our lord? When I delight our lord, I expound horizontally with the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music; I expound vertically with the golden tablets and the Six Strategies. Those who serve him with great merit cannot be numbered, yet our lord has never once parted his lips in response. Now by what means have you delighted our lord, causing him to be so pleased?"

Xu Wugui said, "I merely told him how I judge dogs and horses."

Nü Shang said, "Is that all?"

Xu Wugui replied, "Have you not heard of the exiles of Yue? After several days away from their state, they rejoice upon seeing those they know; after a month away, they rejoice upon seeing those they once saw in their state; after a full year, they rejoice upon seeing those who merely resemble people. Is it not that the longer one is parted from others, the deeper one’s longing grows? Now, those who flee into the emptiness of the wilds—where brambles and thorns obstruct the paths of badgers and weasels—stumble through the void, yet when they hear the sound of human footsteps, they are overjoyed. How much more so, then, for the voices and laughter of brothers and kin at their side? For how long has no one spoken the words of a true person at our lord’s side?"

*The Golden Tablets and Six Strategies* is none other than the *Military Methods of the Grand Duke*. This text was stored in the royal court, hence the name "Golden Tablets," akin to the "Golden Casket" or the writings of the Stone Chamber. Its teachings encompass shifting alliances and reversals, unfolding in expansive discourse—one must not rigidly equate the *Odes* and *Documents* with "alliances" and the *Six Strategies* with "submission."

"Serving in attendance" refers to following the king’s affairs. When the principles of the *Odes*, *Documents*, and *Six Strategies* are applied to action and all prove efficacious, it is said that "serving in attendance yields great merit."

"Parting the lips" signifies laughter. "Exiles" are those banished from their state and cast adrift. "Those they know" refers to old acquaintances; "those they once saw" means those merely recognized by face; "those who resemble people" are those who look like their fellow villagers.

The paths of mountain valleys are called "the trails of badgers and weasels." *Zhu* means "to obstruct." *Liàng* (踉) is pronounced like *láng*; the *Lei Pian* states it describes a stumbling gait. *Wèi* means "to dwell" or "to halt"—it speaks of one exhausted, attempting to move yet stopping, crouching in the ravine. "Emptiness" refers to the valley. Hearing the sound of footsteps brings joy, for it is enough that they belong to a person, not necessarily an acquaintance or fellow villager.

This illustrates that the innate truth of Lord Wu had long been lost; even a faint echo of such words was like one fleeing through an empty valley hearing footsteps—thus the joy. This is what the Chan school calls "a long journey home."

If the people’s *qì* and virtue prevail, the people will have escaped death and each secured their lives—what need would there be to seek the cessation of war?

When the Yellow Emperor sought to meet the Great Hidden One at Mount Juzi, Fangming drove his chariot, Changyu rode as his attendant, Zhangruo and Zhupeng led the horses, while Kunhun and Guji followed in the rear carriage. Arriving at the wilds of Xiangcheng, the Seven Sages all lost their way and had no one to ask for directions. They happened upon a boy herding horses and inquired of him, saying, "Do you know of Mount Juzi?" The boy replied, "I do." "Do you know where the Great Hidden One resides?"

The boy said, "I do." The Yellow Emperor said, "How extraordinary, little boy! Not only do you know of Mount Juzi, but you also know where the Great Hidden One resides. May I ask how to govern the world?" The boy replied, "Governing the world is just like this—what more is there to do? When I was young, I roamed freely within the Six Directions, but then I fell ill with dizziness. An elder taught me, saying, 'Ride the chariot of the sun and wander the wilds of Xiangcheng.' Now that my illness has slightly improved, you speak of my roaming beyond the Six Directions again. Governing the world is just like this—what more is there for me to do?"

The Yellow Emperor said, "Governing the world is truly not your concern. Nevertheless, may I ask how to govern it?" The boy declined, but the Yellow Emperor pressed further. The boy then said, "What difference is there between governing the world and herding horses? It is simply a matter of removing what harms the horses, that is all." The Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touching his forehead to the ground, and called him "Heavenly Master" before withdrawing.

The Seven Sages—namely, the Yellow Emperor, Fangming, Changyu, Zhangruo, Zhupeng, Kunhun, and Guji—are all allegorical figures. To take the Great Hidden One as the embodied *po* of the Great Dao would be a forced interpretation. *Mào* means dizziness.

One who rides the sun moves with it, ever renewing with each day. To say that within the Six Directions one has not yet parted from things is to suffer the affliction of self-inflicted blindness. If one can depart from this affliction and wander in spontaneity, one enters beyond the Six Directions. The meaning is that governing the world is likewise a matter of being unburdened by things.

"That is not your concern" means: though you stand beyond things, you must still explain it to me. Horses form herds and are pastured—each follows water and grass, and if one simply follows their nature and ensures they come to no harm, the Way of herding horses is complete. This is the same as the idea of herding sheep by striking those that lag behind.

"Heavenly Master" means one whom heaven and humanity may take as their teacher. The contemplative scholar finds no joy without the transformations of thought; the eloquent scholar finds no joy without the order of discourse; the scrutinizing scholar finds no joy without the confrontation of reproof—all are confined by things. "Transformations of thought" refers to the hundred shifts of reflection. "Order of discourse" means speaking with coherence. *Líng* means to overbear; *suì* means to reprove. The keen observer delights in disputing the finest distinctions. All three take their strengths as sources of joy, and thus a single day without them brings no joy. This is to be enveloped by the desires of things—hence, "confined by things."

Those who summon the age rise to court; the mediocre delight in office; the strong boast of overcoming hardship; the brave exult in peril; warriors rejoice in battle; recluses cherish their names; legalists expand governance; ritualists refine their demeanor; the benevolent prize connection. "Rising to court" means establishing oneself in the halls of power. "Summoning the age" refers to those who set up banners to make a name in the world—those who love fame. The "mediocre" are common folk who take rank and salary as glory. "Strong" refers to those with talent and strength. "Boasting of hardship" means priding oneself on overcoming adversity. "Brave" refers to warriors who delight in peril. "Recluses" are those who wither in seclusion, intent on preserving their reputations. "Legalists" belong to the school of law, seeking to expand governance. "Refining demeanor" means maintaining outward composure as a display. "Prize connection" means valuing social ties.

Farmers find no harmony without the work of tilling; merchants find no harmony without the bustle of the marketplace. Common folk are spurred by daily labor; artisans take pride in the skill of their tools. "Tilling" refers to the work of cultivation; "marketplace" to the affairs of trade. "Harmony" means joy. "Daily labor" accumulates over time, and its surplus brings encouragement and the will to exert oneself. Artisans take their abilities as a source of pride—this is self-praise. The greedy grow anxious without accumulating wealth; the vainglorious grieve when power does not exceed others. Those who rely on power and things delight in change. The boastful and deceitful flock to power, and a single setback plunges them into sorrow. *Yóu* means "excessive"—the desire for ever-greater prominence. "Not excessive" means not reaching such extremes. Those with support are called "power"; those with accumulation are called "things." "Followers" are those who attach themselves. "Those who rely on power and things" are those who cling to the gates of the rich and noble. "Delighting in change" means taking deceit as pleasure. Petty men who attach themselves prefer action to stillness, for only by swaying their patrons into action can they achieve their aims—hence, "those who rely on power and things delight in change." The foregoing, along with the three instances of "find no joy," share the same meaning, varying only in length and phrasing—this is a matter of literary technique.

When the times call for action, one cannot remain inactive. All these follow the seasons in accord, not subjecting things to change. They exhaust their natures and sink into the ten thousand things, never returning for the whole of their lives—how lamentable!

"When the times call for action" means the age compels it; even one’s own body is not free, and though one may wish to remain inactive, it is impossible. Just as in the course of a year, the growth and completion of the hundred things follow their sequence, their changes are not freely chosen—hence, "follow the seasons in accord, not subjecting things to change." This sentence serves as a metaphor for the preceding one. "Not subjecting things to change" means things do not alter of their own accord. "Exhausting their natures" means wearing out body and mind. "Sinking into the ten thousand things" means drowning, submerged in the midst of them. To spend one’s life without knowing how to return—*fǎn* here is like the Buddhist phrase "turning the light inward to illuminate oneself."

Zhuangzi said: "An archer who hits the mark without aiming is called a good shot. If all under heaven were like Yi, would that be acceptable?" Huizi said: "It would." Zhuangzi said: "If all under heaven lack a shared standard of rightness and each takes their own as right, then if all under heaven were like Yao, would that be acceptable?" Huizi said: "It would." Zhuangzi said: "Then the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Bing—four schools—together with you make five. Which is truly right? Or is it someone like Lu Ju?" His disciple said: "I have grasped the Master’s Way! I can boil a cauldron in winter and make ice in summer!" Lu Ju said: "This merely summons yang with yang and yin with yin—it is not what I call the Way. Let me show you my Way." Thereupon, he tuned two zithers, placing one in the hall and one in the chamber. When he plucked the *gōng* note, the *gōng* note resonated; when he plucked the *jué* note, the *jué* note resonated—their tones were in harmony. But if he altered the tuning of one string so that it no longer fit the five notes, and then plucked it, all twenty-five strings would vibrate, yet the sound was no different—its ruler was already established. "Is this what you mean?"

"Aiming and hitting the mark" means having a target to aim for; only with a target can one see true skill.

If one shoots with eyes half-closed, then all who hit the mark would be Yi. This sentence serves as a metaphor for the following one—its phrasing is most ingenious. Since the world lacks a single, unified truth, each person clings to their own doctrine, and thus all become Yao. Yang refers to Yang Zhu; Bing refers to Gongsun Long. Mo Di, Yang Zhu, Gongsun Long, and Hui Shi formed a cohort, yet their teachings diverged—who then held the true Way?

In winter’s cold, one does not heat a cauldron with fire; in summer’s heat, one can make ice with water—such defiance of the seasons seems impossible. Yet on the winter solstice, yang qi has already begun to stir; on the summer solstice, yin qi has already begun to rise. Summon yang with yang, and winter loses its chill; summon yin with yin, and summer loses its heat. Though this appears to defy the seasons, there is a principle by which they may be summoned—thus it is not what I call the Way. The art remains unrefined.

*Fèi* means "to place." One zither is set in the hall, another in the chamber. Though separated by distance, when this one is plucked, that one responds: *gōng* answers *gōng*, *jué* answers *jué*—their tones harmonize, and this is easily done. But if one string is retuned so that it no longer aligns with the five notes, then whether one plays *gōng* or *zhǐ*, it matters not—for my tone has no fixed place. Yet when that single string is plucked, all twenty-five strings, though distant, vibrate in unison. Compared to the resonance of *gōng* with *gōng* or *jué* with *jué*, this is far more difficult. Yet in principle, whether *gōng*, *shāng*, *jué*, *zhǐ*, or *yǔ*, all are but sound responding to sound—thus it is the ruler of tones. None depart from the sound of the strings, so it is said they do not differ in essence. How then does this differ from summoning yin with yin or yang with yang? Lu Ju merely believed himself superior to his disciple—each insisting on their own rightness, neither discerning true rightness.

"Is this not the case?"—meaning Hui Shi’s claim to rightness is no different from Lu Ju’s.

Hui Shi said: "Now the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Gongsun Long all contend with me in debate, clashing in words, overpowering with voices, yet never conceding my wrongness—what then is to be done?"

Zhuangzi replied: "A man of Qi, having sent his son to Song to serve as a gatekeeper, did not entrust him with the full duty, yet when seeking a small bell, bound it carefully. When searching for his lost son, he never left his hometown—what folly! The man of Chu who lodged abroad as a lame gatekeeper fought with the boatman in the dead of night, though he had not yet left the shore, and thus sowed the seeds of resentment.

*Xiāngfú yǐ cí* means to clash in words; *xiāngzhèn yǐ shēng* means to overpower with reputation. *Wèishǐ wú fēi* means insisting to the end that one is right. *Zhí* (蹢) is pronounced like *zhì* (掷); the *Shuowen* defines it as "to halt the foot." A child who halts and cannot walk is called a *zhízi*. The man of Qi, sending his lame son to Song, believed him fit to guard the gate. Yet gatekeepers are not chosen from the whole—thus he already deemed his son right. But when seeking a small bell, he bound it with care—why cherish an object more than one’s own child? He too believed himself right. *Xíngzhōng* refers to a small bell. *Táng* means "lost." Searching for his lost son only within his hometown—what confusion! Yet he never saw himself as confused. This sentence does not directly follow the previous analogy of the lame son.

*Yí* means "remnant" or "partial"; *lèi* means "likeness." These three examples all resemble Hui Shi and the followers of Yang and Mo—thus it is said they share a partial likeness. This echoes the earlier phrase, "Is this not the case?" Yet rather than concluding with "sowing resentment," it first ties the analogy here—such is the artistry of the prose.

*Jì* means "guest." A lame gatekeeper from Chu, lodging abroad, unable to return home, boarded a boat. Upon reaching the shore at midnight, he quarreled with the boatman, forgetting the debt of his deliverance and thus breeding enmity. *Cén* means "shore." "Not yet having left the shore" means the boat had just arrived, and he had not forgotten the journey’s length. *Zhí* means "to halt the foot." Afflicted in foot, he served as a gatekeeper—thus *zhíhūn*. To fight in ingratitude in the night—though he did not realize it then, by dawn, could he not feel shame? In the moment of conflict, he too believed himself right.

These several passages all employ analogies to mock Hui Shi’s self-righteousness. Yet because Hui Shi delighted in debate, Zhuangzi crafted these cunning words—some obscure—to confound him. Such was the playful banter of their lifelong exchanges. One may compare this to the debates of Dongfang Shuo, which share a similar spirit.

Once, as Zhuangzi passed by Hui Shi’s grave while attending a funeral, he turned to his followers and said: "A man of Ying daubed his nose-tip with white clay, thin as a fly’s wing, and had Carpenter Shi shave it away. Carpenter Shi swung his axe like the wind, listening as he struck, removing all the clay without harming the nose. The man of Ying stood unmoved. When the Lord of Song heard of this, he summoned Carpenter Shi and said, 'Try it for me.' Carpenter Shi replied, 'Your servant once could do this—but my partner has long been dead.' Since the Master’s passing, I have had no partner, no one with whom to speak."

*È* is white clay. The man of Ying smeared his nose-tip with white clay, as thin as a fly’s wing, and had Carpenter Shi pare it away. *Yùn jīn chéng fēng* means the swiftness of his swing. That the clay was removed without harming the nose was already difficult; yet had the man of Ying stood unsteadily, even a skilled carpenter could not have spared his nose—thus the one standing was even more difficult. The partner is the ground for skill’s display.

Here the meaning is that only with Hui Shi’s disputation could I exhaust my arguments—now that Hui Shi is dead, there is no one left to speak with.

When Guan Zhong fell ill, Duke Huan asked him, "Master Zhong’s illness has grown grave—what should I do? If it reaches its final stage, to whom may I entrust the state?" Guan Zhong replied, "Whom does Your Lordship wish to appoint?" The Duke said, "Bao Shuya." Guan Zhong said, "That will not do. He is a man of spotless integrity and noble character, yet those who do not measure up to him he will not countenance. Moreover, once he hears of another’s fault, he never forgets it. If he were to govern the state, above he would constrain his lord, and below he would alienate the people. It would not be long before he offended his ruler." The Duke said, "Then who is suitable?" Guan Zhong replied, "If you must choose, then Xi Peng will do. His character is such that he forgets his rank above and keeps his distance below. He feels shame before those who surpass the Yellow Emperor and pity for those who fall short. To share virtue with others is the mark of a sage; to share wealth with others is the mark of a worthy. To lord one’s worth over others is never to win their allegiance; to humble one’s worth before others is never to fail in winning their allegiance. In governing the state, there are things he does not hear; in managing his household, there are things he does not see. If you must choose, then Xi Peng will do."

To entrust the state means to entrust the governance of the state. "Does not countenance" means he does not associate with such people. "Constrain" means to bind and restrict. "Alienate" means to force the people to comply with ritual and duty. These several phrases all refer to his being too stark in his judgments of right and wrong. "Forgets his rank above" means he forgets his own position; "keeps his distance below" means he remains aloof and makes no demands on his subordinates. "To share virtue with others" is like the saying, "When virtue descends, the common people embrace it." "To share wealth with others" means not to be selfish. "To lord one’s worth over others" means to flaunt one’s reputation and look down on those below. "There are things he does not hear, things he does not see" means he is not overly exacting. This account does not appear in other texts and is found only in the *Liezi*; it is merely a parable. "What should I do?" means he is speaking to himself, hence the phrase, "what should I do? If it reaches its final stage."

When the King of Wu was sailing on the river, he ascended Mount Cu and was seen by a gathering of macaques. Startled, they fled in terror into the dense thickets. One monkey, however, moved sinuously through the branches, seizing and grasping with great dexterity, as if showing off before the king. The king shot at it, and the monkey swiftly caught the arrows in mid-flight. The king ordered his attendants to shoot together, and though the monkey was nimble, its strength was no match for theirs, and it was seized and killed. The king turned to his companion Yan Buyi and said, "This monkey relied on its skill and agility to defy me—see how far it has brought itself! Take heed! Alas, never let your bearing be so arrogant toward others." Yan Buyi returned home and became a disciple of Dong Wu, purging his arrogance. He forsook pleasure and shunned fame, and after three years, the people of the state praised him.

"Moved sinuously through the branches, seizing and grasping" describes its leaping and swinging among the trees. "Swiftly caught" means the arrows flew fast, yet the monkey could snatch them with great speed. "Attendants" refers to those at the king’s side. Though the monkey was skillful, when all shot at once, its strength failed, and it was seized and killed—hence "seized and killed." "Purging his arrogance" means removing his haughty demeanor. "Forsaking pleasure" means embracing hardship willingly. "Shunning fame" means withdrawing into obscurity. This is a parable for those who bring disaster upon themselves through pride in their abilities.

Nanbo Zijing sat leaning on his armrest, gazing upward and sighing. Yan Chengzi entered and said, "Master, you are a paragon among men—can the body truly be made like withered bones, the mind like dead ashes?" Zijing replied, "Once I dwelled at the mouth of a mountain cave. At that time, when the farmer He saw me, the people of the state of Qi all rejoiced three times. I must have been the first to know something, and so he knew it; I must have sold it, and so he purified himself to receive it. Had I not possessed it, how could he have known it? Had I not sold it, how could he have purchased it?"

Alas! I grieve for those who ruin themselves, yet I grieve still more for those who grieve for such grief—how distant their later days become.

"Paragon among men" means the greatest among all beings. *Tian He* was the lord of Qi. The people of the state rejoiced because they beheld one worthy. At that time, I could not conceal my traces, and so this fame arose. "First" and "sold" mean that I must have left visible marks, and thus he could perceive me.

Those who reveal themselves through such traces are indeed self-ruined. Yet one who can grieve for another’s self-ruin but cannot awaken to their own—such grief for others is itself pitiable. *The mouth of the mountain cave* is a place name. At that time, I only grieved for others’ grief while awakening to myself, and so my Dao daily advanced, until today my form has become like withered bones and my mind like dead ashes. Thus it is said, "how distant their later days become." "Distant" means the Dao grows ever more lofty and remote.

When Confucius traveled to Chu, the king of Chu offered him wine. Sunshu Ao stood holding the goblet, while Shinan Yiliao received the wine and made a libation, saying: "Men of old have spoken thus." Confucius said: "I have heard of the wordless word, yet never have I spoken it—until now, when I speak it here."

Shinan Yiliao juggled balls to resolve the feud between two families, while Sunshu Ao slept sweetly, holding a feather fan, and the people of Ying laid down their weapons. I wish I had a beak three feet long! What they call the "Dao of the undaoed," this is what I call the "eloquence of the unspoken."

Thus virtue gathers where the Dao is one, and speech ceases where knowledge knows no more—this is perfection. Where the Dao is one, virtue cannot be the same; where knowledge knows no more, eloquence cannot exhaust it. Names like "Confucian" or "Mohist" bring only misfortune.

Thus the sea does not refuse the eastward flow—this is the utmost greatness. The sage embraces heaven and earth, bestowing blessings upon the world, yet none know his name. Thus in life he holds no rank, in death he bears no posthumous title; his reality does not accumulate, his name does not endure—this is the *Great Man*.

A dog is not good because it barks well, nor is a man worthy because he speaks well—how much less so for one who is but a dog! To be great is not enough to be called great—how much less so for virtue! The greatest completeness is nothing like heaven and earth, yet what do they seek to be complete?

One who knows great completeness seeks nothing, loses nothing, discards nothing, does not alter himself for things, returns to himself without exhaustion, follows antiquity without friction—this is the sincerity of the *Great Man*.

"Men of old have spoken thus"—he meant that even in drinking wine, one may engage in lively discourse, just as the ancients did. The Master replied: "I possess a wordless word, which I have never spoken to others—until now, when I speak it here."

Playing with balls is but a trifling amusement. Holding a feather fan and sleeping contentedly—this is the bearing of one who acts through non-action. You two have already mastered the art of non-action; what need is there for me to say more?

"Three-foot beak" speaks of one whose tongue is not so long. The tales of Yiliao and Shu Ao differ from the historians' accounts—these are but allegories.

Where the Dao unites, it is the natural state. Virtue is what one attains within oneself. What the Creator unifies differs from what men contrive; thus, virtue cannot be the same. Note how this "virtue" differs from its usage elsewhere in this text.

If one bears the names of Confucian or Mohist, one has already strayed from the wordless discourse—hence it is said, "and none knew whose clan he was," for the people could not name him. "Not gathering in reality" means that though one may possess goodness, one does not claim it for oneself alone.

Even the worthy do not take loquacity as ability—how much less the *Great Man*? To bear the name of greatness is insufficient to be great—how much less can the towering virtue of such a one be named? "Great completeness" is great perfection. Only by seeking nothing does one lose nothing and discard nothing.

"Not altering oneself for things" means that the self is nobler than external things. "Following antiquity" means proceeding in accord with the ancient Way. "Without friction" means without forcing.

Zijing had eight sons arrayed before him. Summoning Jiufang Yin, he said: "Examine my sons for me and tell me which is most auspicious." Jiufang Yin replied: "Kun is the most auspicious." Ziqí started in delight and asked: "In what way?" He answered: "Kun will share the ruler’s table and feast thus for the rest of his life." Ziqí’s face fell, and tears welled up as he said: "What has my son done to reach such an extreme?"

Jiufang Yin replied: "When one shares the ruler’s table, blessings extend to three generations—how much more to one’s parents? Yet you weep upon hearing this; this is to reject good fortune. Your son is auspicious, but you are not."

Ziqí said: "Yin, how could you possibly know that Kun is auspicious? His fate is bound to meat and wine, entering only through his nose and mouth—how could he know their source? I have never herded, yet creatures gather in the inner chamber; I have never hunted, yet quails hatch in the corner. If this is not strange, what is?

What I share with my sons is a wandering through heaven and earth. With them, I roam in joy beneath the sky; with them, I feast upon the earth. I do not involve myself in their affairs, nor in their schemes, nor in their oddities. With them, I ride the sincerity of heaven and earth without clashing with things. With them, I drift in harmony, unconcerned with what affairs deem fitting.

Yet now, such worldly recompense has befallen us. Wherever strange omens appear, strange conduct must follow. Alas! This is not the fault of my sons or me—it is Heaven’s doing. This is why I weep."

Before long, Kun was sent to Yan. Bandits seized him on the road. To sell him whole would be difficult; to sell him maimed would be easy. Thus, they cut off his feet and sold him in Qi, where he ended up on the Duke of Qu’s estate, fed meat for the rest of his life.

Meat and wine enter the nose and mouth, yet he knows not whence they come—how could he claim to have earned them?

*Zhi* is a ewe. *Ao* is the southwest corner of a room. *Jian* is the northeast corner. Though I have never herded nor hunted, these creatures suddenly appear in my home—how strange! This is meant to illustrate that my sons and I seek nothing from the world; how could such things befall us?

"Roaming in joy beneath the sky" means delighting in accord with Heaven. "Feasting upon the earth" means sustaining oneself in the world without other desires. "Affairs" are worldly matters; "schemes" are private plots. Worldly affairs and private schemes are aberrations against the natural Way. I have never involved myself in such things with my sons—this is what it means to be "without heart for the world." Hence: "I do not involve myself in their affairs, nor in their schemes, nor in their oddities."

"Drifting in harmony" means following the natural course. One does not seek to respond to affairs, nor does one know what is fitting or unfitting—hence, "unconcerned with what affairs deem fitting."

"Repayment" means settling a debt. While I delight in non-action, if those associated with me share sustenance with rulers, it signifies that within their allotted portion remains an unpaid debt to worldly customs. Such strange confirmations should not befall my sons, for discordant and aberrant matters will surely follow—hence, "aberrant conduct."

"The streets of Lord Qu" refers to a gate facing the thoroughfare, where a gatekeeper stands. This further illustrates how human affairs may yield events beyond expectation—such is fate.

Nie Que encountered Xu You and asked, "Where are you going?"
Xu You replied, "I am fleeing from Yao."
Nie Que asked, "What do you mean?"
Xu You said, "Yao, with his boundless benevolence, I fear will become a laughingstock to the world. In later ages, men may well devour one another. The people do not disperse of their own accord: if you love them, they draw near; if you benefit them, they come; if you praise them, they are encouraged; but if you impose what they detest, they scatter. Love and benefit arise from benevolence and righteousness, yet those who discard benevolence and righteousness are few, while those who exploit them are many. The practice of benevolence and righteousness lacks sincerity and is but a tool for rapacious men, like beasts of prey. Thus, when one man’s decrees benefit the world, it is like a single thin knot unraveling in reverse. Yao knew that worthy men could benefit the world, but he did not realize they could also harm it—only those who stand beyond worthiness understand this.

If you love them, they draw near; if you benefit them, they come; if you praise them, they are encouraged; but if you impose what they detest, they scatter. Knowing these four principles, one may gather the people. To impose what they detest is to act contrary to their desires, and when you impose what they detest, the people will not return. To follow their likes and dislikes in seeking their allegiance is the way of those who harbor ulterior motives.

Benevolence and righteousness, when practiced outwardly, are acts of deliberate effort—hence, they lack sincerity. Rapacious men, like beasts, may exploit these seven virtues for their own ends—thus, they are but tools for the predatory. *Mi* means to sever. A single severance is like a single cut, a decisive break. Those who act with intent to decree and benefit the world sever the pure, uncarved simplicity of nature into fragments. Only those who stand beyond worthiness—above the worthy—can perceive that those who act with intent to benefit the world instead harm it.

There are those who are *nuan shu*, those who are *ru xu*, and those who are *juan lou*. The *nuan shu* are those who study the words of a single master, delighting privately in their narrow learning, self-satisfied and unaware that nothing has truly begun—hence, they are called *nuan shu*. The *ru xu* are like lice on a pig: they choose sparse bristles, imagining them a vast palace or park, nestling in the crooks of hooves, between teats and thighs, believing themselves secure in their advantageous position—until the butcher one day rolls up his sleeves, spreads straw, and lights the fire, and they are roasted along with the pig. These advance and retreat within their narrow bounds—hence, they are called *ru xu*. The *juan lou* is Shun. Mutton does not attract ants, but ants are drawn to mutton because of its rank odor. Shun’s rank conduct pleased the people, so that when he moved thrice, he founded cities, and by the time he reached the wilds of Deng, a hundred thousand households had gathered. Yao, hearing of Shun’s worthiness, raised him from barren soil, saying he hoped to receive his beneficent influence. Yet when Shun was raised from that barren land, his years had grown long, his faculties had dimmed, and he could not retire—hence, he is called *juan lou*.

*Nuan shu* describes those with shallow vision who take private delight in their learning, mocking those who pursue study. "Unaware that nothing has truly begun" means they do not comprehend the wonder of non-being. *Ru xu* describes those who are mired and dependent, clinging to power and profit—like lice on a pig. *Shu lie* refers to the pig’s sparse bristles; *qu wei*, the crooks of its hooves; *gu jiao*, the area near its flanks and legs. This is like a beggar warming himself by a fire while leaning on an iceberg—what he relies upon cannot be relied upon. *Yu* means confining one’s heart to the pursuit of wealth and rank without self-awareness—hence, "advancing and retreating within their bounds." *Juan lou* describes one who is bent and self-afflicting: those who cultivate virtue believe their reputation will draw people, yet they are ensnared by it, toiling endlessly without respite—this is a veiled mockery of emperors and kings. *Tong tu* means barren land, referring to the desolate place where Shun first dwelled.

Thus, the spirit-like person detests the multitude’s arrival, for when the multitude arrives, they do not harmonize, and when they do not harmonize, it brings no benefit. Therefore, one should be without extreme closeness or extreme distance, embracing virtue and kindling harmony to follow the world—this is the true person. With ants, discard knowledge; with fish, act with calculation; with sheep, discard intent. Use the eye to see the eye, the ear to hear the ear, the heart to return to the heart. Those who are thus are as level as a carpenter’s line, their transformations following the natural course.

The true persons of old treated things with Heaven, not allowing the human to intrude upon the Heavenly. The true persons of old gained life through it and lost life through it, gained death through it and lost death through it. "The multitude’s arrival" means the gathering of the common people. "Not harmonizing" means discord. "No benefit" means self-harm. "Embracing virtue and kindling harmony" means nurturing one’s virtue without display—*yang* means warming oneself inwardly. Ants are the most insignificant of creatures, yet even they cannot fully abandon knowledge; sheep are the most foolish, yet even they cannot fully abandon intent. Only the true person is without knowledge and without intent—hence, "with ants, discard knowledge; with sheep, discard intent." Fish in water are carefree and content; the true person’s self-calculation is like that of a fish—here, water symbolizes the Creator, and the fish symbolizes the self. Ants and sheep seek sustenance externally and cannot be without desire—thus, they are not equal to the fish.

The true person’s heart, ears, and eyes are the same as those of others, yet they employ them without intent—thus it is said: "With the eye, see the eye; with the ear, hear the ear; with the heart, return to the heart." The levelness of a plumb line is the levelness of nature itself. To change yet follow it is to comply with its movement. Not imposing the mind’s intent upon the principles of nature—thus it is said: "Do not let the human intrude upon the celestial."

In life, they seem to gain or lose; in death, they likewise seem to gain or lose. Yet they do not regard life and death as gain or loss, allowing things to unfold as they will—whether calling life "gain" or death "gain," death "loss" or life "loss," all is acceptable.

As for medicines, their true nature—*ge* (reed), *jiegeng* (balloon flower), *jiyong* (foxnut), *shiling* (chinaroot)—at times serves as the sovereign. How can one exhaust their descriptions? *Dong* is Sichuan aconite. *Jiyong* is the seed of the foxnut. *Shiling* is wood polypore. When physicians prepare medicines, they adapt them to their use, each having its governing role. The sovereign governs, while the rest serve as ministers. Though called "medicines," their true nature is the same. Their application varies in weight, much like people in the world—when their time comes, they are valued; when it does not, they are disregarded. Yet in themselves, they are neither noble nor base.

These several lines are extraordinary prose.

Goujian, with three thousand men in armor, took refuge on Mount Kuaiji. Only Fan Li knew how to preserve the state from ruin, yet only Fan Li failed to perceive the sorrow that would befall himself. Thus it is said: "The owl’s eyes have their purpose; the crane’s legs have their measure—when untied, it is sorrowful." Minister Fan Li enabled Goujian to avenge Yue against Wu, securing survival from the brink of destruction—this was wisdom indeed. Yet he did not foresee that it would lead to his own demise. At first, Goujian’s use of Fan Li was like the sovereign’s moment; later, his execution of him was another moment.

The owl’s eyes serve by night but not by day—this too follows the moment. The crane’s legs have their joints, though long, they cannot be severed. *Jie* means to sever. When the crane stands, its legs may stretch or bend, yet they too must follow the moment in their use.

Thus it is said: when the wind passes over the river, it diminishes it; when the sun passes over the river, it diminishes it. Suppose only the wind and sun were to remain together by the river—the river would not yet consider itself diminished, for it relies on its source. The wind and sun above the river both diminish the water, yet the river never deems itself diminished, for its source is long. Its source arises from the natural, so though things may diminish it, it suffers no conflict or resistance.

These five lines form a single idea. *Zhi* means "only." *Qing* means "to cause." To cause the wind and sun to remain together by the river is to say they guard it without departing.

Thus water’s adherence to earth is certain; a shadow’s adherence to its form is certain; a thing’s adherence to another thing is certain. Water and earth naturally intermingle; form and shadow naturally depend on one another. *Shou* means they do not separate. A thing’s adherence to another thing is like water flowing toward the wet, fire inclining toward the dry—what is rooted in heaven turns upward, what is rooted in earth turns downward. *Shen* means fixed, certain, unchanging: this is how it is determined. These three lines share a single idea—an immutable principle of heaven and earth, one that cannot be altered. Only by examining these three *shen* does one understand why the *shen* in the seventh chapter’s "profound name" cannot be replaced with *pan*.

Thus the eye’s reliance on clarity is perilous; the ear’s reliance on hearing is perilous; the heart’s pursuit of things is perilous. Whatever exerts its faculties from the organs is perilous. Once peril is formed, there is no time to change it; calamity’s growth thus accumulates. *Dai* means danger. To fix the mind on using clarity, on using hearing, on pursuing things—none of these are the way of self-preservation, hence they are perilous. *Fu* refers to the organs. When wisdom issues from the organs, one takes it as ability, yet all such things are dangerous—thus it is said, "Whatever exerts its faculties from the organs is perilous." *Bu ji* means "not in time." Once danger is formed, there is no time to change it. *Zi cui* means "ever more." *Zi* is the same as *zi* ("to increase").

Its reversal arises from striving for merit; its consequence awaits duration. Yet people regard this as their treasure—is this not lamentable? Thus there are those who lose their states and slaughter their people without end, for they do not know to question this.

*Fan* means overturn; *yuan* means "to follow." Following the mind that schemes for merit will inevitably lead to self-overturning and defeat. *Guo* means "inevitable." One who waits for a long-term scheme becomes rigid and unyielding—all these harm the self, yet people delight in them as if they were treasures. Thus it is said, "people regard this as their treasure." From ancient times to now, those who have lost their states or suffered punishment have followed one after another without end, all because they did not know to question this—meaning they did not seek the Way.

Thus the foot’s tread upon the earth is limited, yet though limited, it relies on what it does not tread to achieve breadth. Human knowledge is scant, yet though scant, it relies on what it does not know to comprehend what heaven calls knowing.

When a person walks upon the earth, the ground their feet tread is but a small portion. If one were to shave away all the earth except what the feet could stand upon, walking would become difficult. *Bo* means "far." Beyond what the feet tread, there must be ground they do not tread—only then can one walk to great distances. *Nian* also means "to tread." This line serves as a metaphor for the next: how little humans truly know! What they do not know is all of heaven. Not relying on what one knows but on what one does not know—this is to know heaven.

To know the Great Unity, to know the Great Yin, to know the Great Eye, to know the Great Balance, to know the Great Square, to know the Great Faithfulness, to know the Great Constancy—this is perfection.

The Great Unity unites all; the Great Yin dissolves all; the Great Eye sees all; the Great Balance follows all; the Great Square embodies all; the Great Faithfulness verifies all; the Great Constancy upholds all.

The Great Unity is the movement of creation—it is heaven’s division of creation from the One. *Yin* means stillness. The Great Yin is supreme stillness; in perfect stillness and constancy, nothing remains unresolved. *Jie* is pronounced like *xie*—akin to what Buddhist texts call "liberation." The Great Eye sees broadly. The Great Balance is the great measure; *yuan* means "to follow." The Great Square is the great void, boundless and undivided—thus it is said, "the Great Square embodies all." The Great Faithfulness is the principle of truth. *Ji* means "to decide." Knowing this truth leaves no doubt to resolve. The Great Constancy is the constancy of all things. *Chi* means "to uphold." To uphold all things under heaven is this single, constant principle.

When one exhausts heaven, there is illumination; when one follows the obscure, there is a pivot; when one begins with that, then its dissolution resembles non-dissolution, its knowing resembles non-knowing—only by not knowing does one come to know.

When affairs reach their limit, the mandate of heaven becomes visible—thus it is said, "when one exhausts heaven, there is illumination," meaning human affairs are exhausted and heavenly principle appears. Following the natural, fortune and misfortune, honor and disgrace, gain and loss—all their principles become clear. Thus it is said, "when one follows, there is illumination." Within obscurity, there is that which holds the pivot—this is what is meant by "upholding the essential," hence it is said, "when one follows the obscure, there is a pivot." The beginning of no-thing must have something to begin it—*Qi Wu Lun* says, "without that, there is no self; without the self, there is nothing to grasp," referring to this *bi*. Thus it is said, "when one begins with that." *Bi* is the natural principle of creation.

Though one may speak of heaven, illumination, the pivot, and that, though one may dissolve and know them, it resembles non-dissolution and non-knowing—meaning one does not presume to claim them as knowable or dissolvable.

Only by taking non-knowing as knowing does one attain true knowing. In inquiring into it, one cannot posit limits, nor can one deny limits. Profound and elusive yet real, unchanging through ancient and modern times, never diminished—how could this not be a grand discourse of exalted exposition? Why, then, remain perplexed? To resolve perplexity with non-perplexity, and return to non-perplexity, is to approach the greatest non-perplexity.

To inquire is to inquire into the principle of creation. To say, "I wish to inquire into the principle of creation," and assume it has limits—this will not do; to assume it has no limits—this, too, will not do. *Xie* means stubborn and dense; *hua* means revolving and turning. The marvel of creation defies all grasp. Ungraspable, it seems as though it were nothing, yet it is real—hence it is said, "profound and elusive yet real." From ancient times to the present, there has been but one transformative process, never replaced, and its use is inexhaustible, never suffering the slightest loss—thus it is said, "unchanging through ancient and modern times, never diminished." Speaking of this principle, how could it not be a momentous argument? *Yangque* means to lift, expound, and discuss it.

Why not inquire into this principle of creation? Why, then, remain in doubt? Hence it is said, "why be perplexed?" Resolving the world’s doubts with this doubtless principle, and returning once more to the state of non-doubt—this is to approach the greatest non-doubt. When Zhaozhou asked Nanquan about the Way of non-doubt, his intent was none other than these words. *Shang* means "to approach." With the two characters "non-doubt," Zhuangzi stirs the spirit, then crafts these lines to conclude the essay—truly extraordinary. In this, how does this chapter differ from the Inner Chapters?

Then Yang of the Miscellaneous Chapters

Zeyang journeyed to Chu, where Yijie spoke of him to the king, yet the king did not summon him. Yijie returned home, and Pengyang sought an audience with King Guo, saying: "Why does the Master not recommend me to the king?" King Guo replied: "I am not your equal to Gong Yuexiu." Pengyang asked: "What does Gong Yuexiu do?" The king said: "In winter, he retreats alone to the river to catch turtles; in summer, he rests in the mountain thickets. If one passes by and asks, he says, 'This is my dwelling.'"

"Yijie could not do this—how much less could I? I am not even Yijie’s equal. As for Yijie’s character: though devoid of virtue, he possesses cunning. He does not rely on the spirit that is naturally his own, and his associations are entangled in the dark and confused realm of wealth and honor. He does not aid others through virtue but instead assists in their dissipation.

"The frozen borrow warmth from spring; the scorched turn back to winter’s cold wind. As for the King of Chu’s character: his form is august and stern. In matters of punishment, he is as unforgiving as a tiger. Without the flattery of a true villain or the rectitude of true virtue, who could sway him?

"Thus the sage: in poverty, he makes his family forget their want; in success, he makes kings and lords forget their ranks and emoluments, transforming loftiness into humility. Toward things, he delights in harmony; toward people, he rejoices in the free flow of all things while preserving himself. Thus, sometimes without speaking, he offers others the harmony of his presence, standing beside them to effect their transformation. In the proper order of father and son, he returns to his dwelling, and in a single moment, all he enacts is fitting.

"His influence on the minds of outsiders is as distant as this. Hence it is said: 'Await Gong Yuexiu.'

"Zeyang’s surname was Peng, his given name Yang, and his courtesy name Zeyang. Yijie once recommended Zeyang to the king, but the king did not employ him and Yijie returned. 'This is my dwelling' means he had no fixed abode. Pengyang was eager for advancement, so the king used the words of a recluse to enlighten him, hoping he would awaken on his own.

"Devoid of virtue yet possessing cleverness means he did not recognize the heavenly principle but relied entirely on private scheming. The spirit is the natural endowment within oneself. To be lost in the entanglements of wealth and honor is to become obstinately confused and lose one’s original heart, no longer knowing that one’s own nature possesses a natural spirit. Hence it is said: 'He does not rely on the spirit that is naturally his own.'

"In his dealings with others, he does not join with them in goodness but instead leads them into a path of self-diminishment. Thus it is said: 'He does not aid others through virtue but instead assists in their dissipation.' This phrase is well-placed below.

"The frozen, when given clothing, feel the warmth of spring; the scorched, when touched by the wind, feel the cold of winter. This speaks of how people must use their surplus to relieve others’ deficiencies. Pengyang’s eagerness for advancement is his deficiency. I tell you to withdraw, like offering a bath to one who is hot or clothing to one who is cold—this will benefit you.

"'His form is august and stern' means he relies on his power to overawe his inferiors. 'In matters of punishment, he is as unforgiving as a tiger' means he is unbenevolent. *Nao* means to humble oneself. Without being a true villain, who could bend and humble themselves to serve him? 'The flattery of a true villain or the rectitude of true virtue'—these four characters are particularly fine.

"Thus, 'the sage in poverty' and what follows all speak of one who possesses the Way and lives in reclusion, without desire for advancement or employment. Kings and lords are the exalted. To forget their ranks and emoluments and humble themselves before scholars is to transform loftiness into humility.

"He exhausts the principles of the myriad things to delight in himself, hence it is said: 'Toward things, he delights in harmony.' In the human world, he follows the principles of the myriad things without the slightest obstruction, taking joy in preserving his true nature. Hence it is said: 'Toward people, he rejoices in the free flow of all things while preserving himself.'

"There is a teaching without words that can awaken others, like offering them the harmony of the purest essence—what the Buddhist scriptures call 'drinking ghee.' The presence of the Way is conveyed in a glance, and proper demeanor dissolves others’ intentions. Hence it is said: 'Standing beside others, he effects their transformation.'

"*Biqi* is like the phrase in the *Book of Songs*: 'That man of his.' This sentence is inverted below. The meaning is: 'That man of his, if he returns to dwell there,' then the proper order of father and son, elder and younger, is each fulfilled. Hence it is said: 'In the proper order of father and son, he returns to his dwelling.' And what he enacts is all fitting in a single moment, without the slightest exertion. Hence it is said: 'In a single moment, all he enacts is fitting.'

"These words speak of how, whether at home or in his village, all is in harmony. 'His influence on the minds of outsiders is as distant as this' means the disparity between people’s capacities is as great as this. This refers to Gong Yuexiu’s heart being as described, while Pengyang’s heart is otherwise—their distance is vast.

"'I am not even Yijie’s equal' means Yijie is a flatterer, and he too is one who seeks advancement. If he recommended you to the king, how could I be like him? This expresses disdain for Yijie.

"'In the proper order of father and son, he returns to his dwelling' is one sentence.

"The sage, in success, is so thoroughly attuned that he embodies all things as one, yet does not know it as such—it is his nature."

The return to one’s mandate is movement and action, taking Heaven as teacher—yet others follow and name it thus.

To be anxious in knowledge is to have few deeds that ever come to fruition; when their time meets obstruction, what then?

"Interwoven" speaks of yin and yang’s creative transformations, their ceaseless mutual arising. "One body" means essence and coarse are united as one.

The sage fathoms the principles of creation and exhausts the wondrous unity of essence and coarse, all-pervading—thus he follows nature without knowing why, and this is called *xing*. *Xing* is the natural.

"Movement and action" are dynamic function. All dynamic function and activity return to Heaven’s mandate, taking the natural as their master—hence "taking Heaven as teacher." "Naming it" means designating it. To name the sage thus is merely what others do—what intent did the sage himself ever have? Thus it is said: "others follow and name it."

"Anxious in knowledge" refers to the private cleverness of men, whose worries are endless, their calculations many—how few of these calculations ever come to pass? Hence "their deeds ever few." If I were to act and be obstructed by fate, what could others do? Thus "when their time meets obstruction, what then?" "Time" is fate; "obstruction" is hindrance.

These two lines thoroughly capture worldly sentiments, tracing their afflictions back to the word "knowledge." If one knew what one does not know, there would be no anxiety—hence the following analogy of the beautiful mirror.

One born beautiful—people offer them a mirror, yet if uninformed, they do not know their beauty surpasses others. Whether they know or do not know, hear or do not hear, their delight never ceases, and others’ admiration for them never ceases—this is *xing*.

The sage’s love for others—people give them this name, yet if uninformed, they do not know of their love for others. Whether they know or do not know, hear or do not hear, their love for others never ceases, and others’ contentment in them never ceases—this is *xing*.

Beauty arises from ugliness; if not shown their ugliness, they would not know their own beauty. Once beauty and ugliness, good and bad are distinguished, the roots of anxiety arise—hence "if they do not know or hear, their delight never ceases." Having no distinction between beauty and ugliness, I meet things with a mindless heart—then others’ admiration for me never ceases. This is the principle of nature, hence "this is *xing*."

Following the analogy of the beautiful mirror, the text turns to the sage’s love for others—its meaning suggests that love, once named, involves intent, and intent departs from the original truth of *xing*.

Returning to one’s old state and old capital, the sight brings joy—even if nine-tenths of its hills, woods, and grasses have overgrown, the joy remains. How much more when one sees and hears what is familiar? It is like a towering terrace where music hangs amidst the crowds.

Ran Xiangshi grasped the center of the ring, following completion—with things, he had no end, no beginning, no moment, no time. One who daily transforms with things is one who does not transform—when did he ever abandon it?

After long travel, returning to one’s old state and capital, there must be a joyful resonance, a stirring of feeling. Even if, within that old state, people and things have changed, the hills overgrown with weeds, nine-tenths lost compared to the past—yet if even a fraction remains familiar, there is still joy. How much more for one seeking the Dao who suddenly awakens, seeing what they have always seen, hearing what they have always heard—all things originally possessed—could they not rejoice? This is what the Buddhists call "original face" and "native scenery."

A ten-*ren* terrace is the highest place. "Hanging" means displaying music; "crowds" means many displays; "amidst" refers to the alternating sounds of *sheng* and *yong* instruments. To stand in so high a place and hear the interwoven music can stir the ears and eyes of the world—how much more for the ancient sages, who with the principle of emptiness, non-action, and nature, delighted in following all things. Their self-abiding was as lofty as the empty center of a ring.

No end, no beginning—end and beginning are as one. No moment, no time—no past, no present. "Moment" refers to the changes of seasons. "Daily transforming with things" means moving with things, ever renewing—yet what I have attained is one unchanging thing, thus put into use. "Abandon" means to leave; "why" is *he*. Why do worldly people not abandon old habits and return to the ultimate Dao?

Ran Xiangshi is an ancient sage. To take Heaven as teacher yet not take Heaven as teacher, to be enslaved with things in their pursuits—how could this be their affair?

The sage never began with Heaven, never began with man, never began with beginning, never began with things. He moves with the world without ceasing, his actions complete yet not stagnant—how could he be said to unite with it?

Tang found his gatekeeper, Yin Deng, and made him his tutor, following the teacher without constraint. Grasping what follows completion, he oversaw its name.

"Taking Heaven as teacher yet not taking Heaven as teacher" means taking nature as model yet having no name for modeling nature—merely following things in accord. Hence "enslaved with things in their pursuits." If there is intent in affairs, then how could it be thus? The slightest intent in affairs is already not natural.

"Man" is having intent; "Heaven" is without intent. Not only are there no traces of action, but even the absence of action is absent—hence "never began with Heaven, never began with man." "Things" are traces; "beginning of no things" is no trace. Not only are there no traces of things, but even the absence of traces is absent—hence "never began with beginning, never began with things."

In traversing this world, one has never not been the same as others, yet in the human realm nothing is ever neglected—hence "moving with the world without ceasing." "Without ceasing" means without neglect. All actions are complete yet none is clung to, hence "what is done is complete yet not sunk." "Equalizing things" speaks of its aged sinking; "sunk" means mired and drowned in attachment. United with the Dao, one does not seek yet naturally accords—if one seeks accord with the Dao, accord cannot be attained, hence "how could it be accorded?"

Tang’s relation to Yi Yin was that he studied under him before making him minister. Zhuangzi, however, alters the names and words, changing his office to "Director of Chariots" and calling him "Gatekeeper Deng Heng"—all such strange and uncanny speech. "Attendant" means assistant, speaking of Yin assisting Tang. Though Tang took Yin as teacher, he was not confined by him, hence "following the teacher without constraint." Tang’s non-action was self-attained from the completed patterns of the myriad things, and he naturally dwelled in the realm of non-action, allowing his assistant to act. Yin, however, took charge of names, hence "attaining what follows completion, overseeing its name." This speaks of Tang’s non-action and Yin’s action, Tang’s namelessness and Yin’s having names. "Oversee" means to take charge, speaking of the Gatekeeper bearing many names of action. These names and models are excessive, revealing both sides. "Zhongni’s exhaustive deliberation" serves as his attendant.

The Master of Rongcheng said: "Remove the days and there is no year; with no inner, there is no outer." This is a name—this name. "Surplus" means excess, remainder. To say this name exists in the world is to speak of surplus patterns, like something superfluous. "Two manifestations" means body and name are divided. If one is intent on making a name, one cannot attain the undifferentiated unity, hence "attaining its two manifestations." What Yi Yin took upon himself was not yet extraordinary, yet Confucius admired him, exhausting his thoughts and deliberations to serve as an assistant in this world—this speaks of the Master wishing to do as Yi Yin had done. This is mockery of the sage’s intent.

The Master of Rongcheng borrows the name of an ancient sage. Combine three days and sixty days to make a year; if you remove the days one by one, you may only call it a day, not a year, hence "remove the days and there is no year." This line is fine in itself—Laozi said, "Count the spokes and there is no cart," which carries the same meaning. The name of the outer arises from the inner; without inner, there is no outer, hence "with no inner, there is no outer." These two lines serve as proof of the natural intent.

When Wei Ying made a pact with Marquis Tian Mou, Marquis Tian Mou betrayed it. Wei Ying grew angry and was about to send an assassin to kill him. Xishou heard of this and found it shameful, saying: "You are a lord of ten thousand chariots, yet you would avenge yourself like a common man? I, Yan, request to receive two hundred thousand armored troops to attack him for you. I will capture his people, seize his cattle and horses, and make his lord’s heart burn within him until his back erupts in sores. Then I will take his state, drive out Ji, and break his spine." Master Ji heard of this and found it shameful, saying: "To build a city wall seventy feet high—once it reaches seventy feet, to tear it down again is the toil of convict laborers. Now, for seven years there has been no war; this is the foundation of your kingship. Yan is a troublemaker; you cannot listen to him."

Master Hua heard of this and found it disgraceful, saying: "One who speaks well of attacking Qi is a troublemaker; one who speaks well of not attacking is also a troublemaker. To say that both attacking and not attacking are the words of troublemakers is yet again the speech of a troublemaker." The lord said: "Then what should be done?" He replied: "My lord, seek only the Dao."

Wei Ying was King Hui of Wei. Tian Hou was King Wei of Qi. *Xumi* were penal laborers conscripted for wall-building. Once a wall is built and then torn down, the laborers find it bitter indeed. For seven years there has been no war—this is the fine achievement of the King of Wei—yet Xishou urges him to deploy troops, like tearing down a wall already built. *Yan* was the given name of Xishou. Master Hua’s words implied that once the word “attack” is uttered, all parties harbor ulterior motives, so he deemed all three positions as those of troublemakers. To know the Dao is to regard war itself as inauspicious. Thus he said: “My lord, seek only the Dao.”

Master Hui heard this and summoned Dai Jinren. Jinren said: “There is a creature called the snail—do you know it?” The king replied: “Yes.” Jinren continued: “On the left horn of the snail dwells the state of Chushi; on the right horn dwells the state of Manshi. From time to time they contend over territory and wage war. Corpses number in the tens of thousands; the pursuit of the routed lasts fifteen days before the victors return.” The king said: “Alas! Is this not an empty tale?” Jinren replied: “Let your servant demonstrate its truth.”

The king pondered: "Do you suppose the four directions and the realms above and below have limits?" The king replied: "They are without limit." Jinren said: "To let the mind wander in the boundless and then return to the lands of communication and passage—do they not seem as if existing, as if not? The king said: "Indeed." Jinren continued: "Within the lands of communication lies Wei; within Wei lies Liang; within Liang lies the king. Is there any distinction between the king and the Manshi?" The king replied: "There is no distinction."

The guest departed, and the king remained in a daze, as if having lost something. When Master Hui entered and saw him, the king said: "This guest is a great man—even a sage cannot compare to him." Master Hui replied: "When one blows into a pipe, there is still a resonant sound; when one blows across the hilt of a sword, there is but a faint whistle. Yao and Shun are praised by all people, yet to speak of Yao and Shun before Dai Jinren is like that faint whistle—utterly insignificant."

Master Hui, having heard of Master Hua’s discourse on seeking the Dao, thus recommended Dai Jinren to the king. Dai Jinren was a man of the Way. The parable of the snail’s horns may seem like an empty tale, yet what follows makes it truly so—hence he said, "Let your servant demonstrate its truth." The boundless refers to the great void. The lands of communication are the Central States. Viewing the Central States from the perspective of the great void, they become exceedingly minute, as if present, as if not—hence the question: "Do they not seem as if existing, as if not?" Du Zimei said: "Gazing down, all is but a single qi—how could one distinguish the imperial domain?" This is the same idea. From the perspective of the Central States, Wei is but small; Liang is its capital, and within Wei, the capital is yet smaller; within the capital, the king’s person is even more minute. From the great void above, descending step by step, the king’s body and the Manshi and Chushi of the snail’s horns are no different—hence the king said, "There is no distinction." This means they are the same.

The king’s dazed state, as if having lost something, reflects his sudden realization that what he once contested was not worth contending. A pipe still has holes; compared to flutes and reeds, though it lacks melody, the one who blows it still produces a resonant sound. But if one blows across a sword’s hilt, there is but a single breath—utterly soundless. This implies that before a man of the Way, even attempts to speak of propriety, righteousness, the Dao, or principle find no place for their voice.

When Confucius traveled to Chu, he lodged at the house of a seller of fermented grain on Ant Mound. A neighbor there—a husband, wife, servant, and concubine—had climbed to the roof’s peak. Zilu said: "What is that bustling crowd doing?" Confucius replied: "They are servants of a sage. They bury themselves among the people, conceal themselves among the fields. Their fame is erased, their aspirations boundless; though their mouths speak, their hearts never truly do. They go against the world, their minds disdaining to align with it. These are the 'land-sunk'—are they not disciples of Shi Nanyilao?" Zilu asked to summon them, but Confucius said: "Enough. He knows I have taken notice of him; he knows I am traveling to Chu. He assumes I will surely persuade the king of Chu to summon him—he would take me for a flatterer. If he feels shame even to hear the words of a flatterer, how much more to meet him in person? What makes you think he remains?" Zilu went to see, but the house was empty.

Ant Mound was a place where a seller of fermented grain lived, and the Master lodged at his home. "Climbing to the roof’s peak" means ascending to the highest point to observe people. *Zongzong* means bustling. "Servants of a sage" refers to the sage’s followers. "Burying themselves among the people" means hiding among the common folk. *Pan* means neighbors—concealing themselves here, even neighbors do not know them. "Their fame is erased" means they flee from renown. *Chen* (sinking) does not refer to water but to land, comparing those who hide in the marketplace’s dust to those submerged. This person must be a disciple of Shi Nanyilao. Nanyilao’s surname was Xiong, and he lived south of the market—a man of Chu.

"Taken notice of him" means he assumes I must know him. A flatterer is one who speaks excessively. "What makes you think he remains?" means he must have departed and not stayed. The house was empty because he fled, fearing the Master would speak of him to the king of Chu and summon him.

Changwu, the border warden, asked Zilao: "In governing, do not be reckless; in ordering the people, do not be careless."

Once, when I farmed grain, I tilled carelessly, and the harvest repaid me in kind; when I weeded recklessly, the yield repaid me likewise. The following year, I changed my methods: I plowed deeply and harrowed thoroughly, and the grain flourished, nourishing me so that I ate my fill all year.

When Zhuangzi heard this, he said: "Most people today, in cultivating their bodies and ordering their minds, resemble what the border warden described—fleeing from their Heaven, departing from their nature, extinguishing their emotions, and losing their spirit, all for the sake of worldly affairs, thus recklessly harming their nature. Desires and aversions sprout like reeds and rushes, first aiding our form, then gradually uprooting our nature. When these fester and erupt without restraint, they manifest as boils, scabies, paralysis, internal heat, and turbid urine. The border warden used farming to illustrate governance; Zhuangzi, in turn, used it to illustrate learning. Su Dongpo’s *On Farming* follows this same analogy.

'Changed my methods' means altering my approach. *Yantie* means to eat one’s fill. 'For the sake of worldly affairs' means such people are common in the world. *E* refers to likes and dislikes. *Nie* means calamity. The harm of likes and dislikes obstructs our inherent nature like dense reeds, akin to the saying 'one’s heart is choked with weeds.' Once nature is obstructed, the growth of base desires spreads like sprouting rushes, filling the body—meaning the entire self becomes consumed by human desires. *Fu* means to assist. When material desires assist our form, sight, hearing, speech, movement, rest, and diet all lose their natural principles. Thus, it is said, 'gradually uprooting our nature.' *Xun* means gradually; *zhuo* means to uproot. At first, true nature is merely obstructed, but as it worsens, it is gradually uprooted, until Heaven’s principles are extinguished. With true nature lost, qi becomes diseased, leading to festering sores, erupting ulcers, and indiscriminate outbursts—any touch may cause illness. 'Festering sores' refer to boils, scabies, and paralysis—diseases of pus and blood. 'Erupting ulcers' refer to internal heat and turbid urine, what we now call wasting disease. This passage warns those who indulge their desires without studying the Dao that they will ultimately destroy themselves.

Boju studied under Lao Dan, saying: "I wish to travel the world." Lao Dan replied: "Enough. The world is everywhere the same." Boju persisted, and Lao Dan asked: "Where will you begin?" He said: "I will begin in Qi." Arriving in Qi, he saw a condemned man. He pushed through the crowd to reach him, removed his court robes to cover him, and wailed to Heaven: "Oh, sir! The world suffers a great calamity, and you alone have encountered it first. Do not steal; do not kill. When honor and disgrace are established, one sees what brings harm; when wealth and property accumulate, one sees what causes strife. Now, you establish what harms people and gather what they contend over, exhausting their bodies without respite. Could one avoid reaching this point?"

'The world is everywhere the same' means the world is universally like this. 'Do not steal; do not kill' implies: "Was your imprisonment due to theft or murder? No, it was not." *Rongru* refers to fame; *huocai* to profit. *Bing* means harm. Those above value fame, and thus such harm arises; those who govern hoard wealth, and thus strife ensues. Laozi said: "Do not exalt the worthy, and the people will not contend; do not prize rare goods, and the people will not steal." This is the same idea. Using fame and profit to enslave people, driving them to endless hardship—how could they not reach this point? His meaning was that in high antiquity, without fame or profit, customs were pure, and states had no criminals.

Ancient rulers regarded success as belonging to the people, failure as their own; uprightness as belonging to the people, crookedness as their own. Thus, if even one person lost their proper form, the ruler would withdraw and take responsibility. Today, it is not so. They conceal matters and deem the unknowing foolish; impose great difficulties and punish those who dare not act; assign heavy burdens and penalize those who cannot bear them; set distant paths and execute those who cannot reach them. When the people exhaust their strength, they resort to deceit. As deception grows daily, how can scholars and commoners not be false?

When strength is insufficient, they feign; when knowledge is lacking, they deceive; when wealth is wanting, they steal. Who is to blame for such thievery? The phrases 'success and failure, uprightness and crookedness' echo: "If the people err, the fault lies with me alone." If even one person fails to live properly, the ruler withdraws and takes responsibility, as if he had cast a commoner into a ditch. But today, it is not so—this refers to later ages. 'Concealing matters' means hiding them and calling the ignorant foolish. 'Imposing great difficulties' means punishing those who dare not act. 'Assigning heavy burdens' means not measuring people’s strength. 'Setting distant paths' means not calculating people’s journeys. They force people to do what they cannot, then punish their failure; they demand what they cannot reach, then execute their shortfall. Those above issue decrees that grow more deceptive by the day—how can scholars and commoners not be false? Forcing what their strength cannot bear, they must respond with deceit; forcing what their knowledge cannot grasp, they must respond with fraud; taking excessively without restraint, they must steal to supply the demand. Thus, we drive them to deceit, fraud, and theft. Who, then, is to blame?

Ju Boyu, at sixty, transformed sixty times, never failing to begin with what he deemed right and end by deeming it wrong. How could what he called right at sixty not have been wrong at fifty-nine?

At sixty, he transformed sixty times—each year’s insight surpassing the last. Yet how can we be certain that what he deemed right at sixty was truly right? This is one point to consider.

All things have life, yet none see their roots; all things emerge, yet none see their gates. People all honor what their knowledge knows, but none know that they must rely on what their knowledge does not know before true knowing arises—can this not be called great doubt? Enough, enough! There is no escaping what is called "so" and "so indeed."

Life must have its roots; emergence must have its gates—only people do not see them. This is what lies beyond knowing. For one to know what they know yet not know what they do not know is the height of subtlety—such is the person of great delusion.

"There is no escaping" means that it is naturally so, so of itself. This unknowing knowing spans past and present, penetrates above and below—all is thus. Where is there a place not governed by this principle? How could one escape it?

"Is it so, indeed?" is a concluding phrase. To call it "so"—is it truly so? When Zigong replied, "So, yet not so," he expressed this very meaning. (See the *Duke Ling of Wei* chapter.) *Ran yu* is read as *yu*.

Confucius questioned the Grand Historian Da Qiang, Bo Changqian, and Xi Wei, saying: "Duke Ling of Wei indulged in wine and revelry, neglecting the governance of his state; he devoted himself to hunting and fowling, ignoring the affairs of the feudal lords. How then did he come to be called 'Ling'?"

Da Tao replied: "It was because of *this* that he was so called."

Bo Changqian said: "Duke Ling had three wives, with whom he bathed in shared licentiousness. When the historian You presented himself in attendance, bearing the ceremonial gifts, the duke had others support and escort him—so extreme was his insolence. Yet when he encountered a worthy man, he would whistle thus in admiration. This is why he was called 'Ling.'"

Xi Wei said: "When Duke Ling died, divination for burial at the ancestral tomb proved inauspicious, while divination at Shaqu was auspicious. Upon digging several *ren* deep, a stone outer coffin was found. After washing it, an inscription was revealed: *'It shall not serve his son.'* Duke Ling seized it and buried it again. That Duke Ling was called 'Ling' had long been so—how could these two men suffice to understand it?"

"Fowling and hunting" refers to the taking of birds and beasts. He ignored all the rites of intercourse between feudal lords. Given such conduct, why was he posthumously titled 'Ling'? The implication is that the title was insufficient to match his wickedness.

Da Tao said: "This was also because the people of the state collectively affirmed it in naming him thus." (The first *shi* character here is synonymous with *ci*, meaning "this.") "Presenting his residence" refers to bringing him to his place of dwelling. "Bearing attendance" is akin to what is now called "summoning for audience." "Grasping the ceremonial silk" means holding the gifts used in formal presentation. Yet Duke Ling had others support and escort him—this was said to be a mark of propriety. *Su* means "reverence."

Before the tomb of sandalwood and stone there were already guests of Duke Ling—thus this name was fixed before his birth, and what power did men have in it? This passage speaks to how all worldly affairs arise from nature.

The two men were Da Tao and Bo Changqian. Sand Hill was an ancient burial site. "Not entrusting to his sons" means his descendants could not be relied upon, so Duke Ling seized it. *Feng* means "to entrust."

Shaozhi asked Taigong Diao: "What is meant by 'the speech of the mound and village'?"

Taigong Diao said: "The mound and village unite ten clans and a hundred names to form customs. They gather differences to make sameness, and scatter sameness to make differences. Now, if you point to the hundred parts of a horse and cannot find the horse, yet the horse stands before you—it is by establishing its hundred parts that you call it a horse. Thus, hills accumulate the low to become high; rivers gather waters to become great; the great person unites all to become public. Therefore, what enters from without has a master but is not grasped; what issues from within has a norm but is not resisted. The four seasons have distinct *qi*, yet Heaven does not bestow them, and so the year is completed. The five offices have distinct duties, yet the ruler does not favor them, and so the state is governed. The virtues of the cultured and martial great person are not bestowed, and so their power is complete. The myriad things have distinct principles, yet the Dao does not favor them, and so it is nameless. Being nameless, it does nothing; doing nothing, yet nothing is left undone. Time has endings and beginnings; the world has changes and transformations. Fortune and misfortune flow naturally—wisdom may encounter what is adverse yet find what is fitting. In pursuing one’s own path, faces differ; where there is rectification, there is also error. Compared to a great marsh, a hundred materials all meet their measure; gazing at a great mountain, trees and stones share the same ground. This is called 'the speech of the mound and village.'"

Gathering wells makes a mound; clustering fruits makes a village—hence "mound and village." Within one village are ten clans and a hundred names; though people and things differ, customs are the same—this is the metaphor of gathering differences to make sameness. "The speech of the mound and village" is the public speech of a village; gathering differences to make sameness means the myriad things share one principle; scattering sameness to make differences means each thing possesses its own principle. Combining a hundred parts to make a horse, no single part bears the name "horse"—this is scattering sameness to make differences. Establishing its hundred parts to call it a horse is gathering differences to make sameness. Accumulating to make a mountain, converging to make water—this is the same idea. Uniting to become public is gathering the differences of the myriad things to make sameness.

"Having a master but not grasping" means what is mastered lies within yet is not held—holding would not be natural. The norm is the principle of the myriad things. What emerges from the heart shares the same principle as the myriad things, thus naturally harmonizing without resistance. Not grasping, not resisting—this is following nature without intent toward sameness or difference.

"Heaven does not bestow" means it does not claim merit, as if saying it does not act for the sake of bestowal. The five offices are ranked, each with its duty—how could the ruler privately weigh them? The great person’s cultured and martial virtues arise in their time: when culture is needed, culture is used; when martial power is needed, it is employed—this is not a matter of bestowal, hence their power is complete. The myriad things each possess their own principle, thus they are called "distinct principles." The great Dao unites them to become public, hence it is said to be "not partial." "Nameless" means it cannot be named.

*Chunchun* means flowing naturally. The arrival of good and ill fortune is ever-changing; what seems adverse may turn out fitting—this is the meaning of the old man by the frontier who gained and lost a horse. *Fu* means adversity, dissatisfaction; *yi* means fitting, satisfaction. If one clings to self-sacrifice, it is like faces—all are different. Where there is rectification, there is rigidity; where there is rigidity, there may be error—hence the saying, "where there is rectification, there is error."

"Compared" means "for example." For instance, in a great marsh, the materials of a hundred things each meet their measure—none too small or large, all can be used. "Same ground" means the same earth. Trees and stones originally share one mountain—what distinction was there at first? This is gathering differences to make sameness.

Shaozhi said: "Then is it sufficient to call this the Dao?"

Taigong Diao said: "No. Now, the count of things is not limited to ten thousand, yet we speak of 'the myriad things'—this is naming them by their great number. Thus, Heaven and Earth are the greatest of forms; yin and yang are the greatest of *qi*; the Dao is their public principle. It is permissible to name and speak of them by their greatness, but once a name exists, how can it be compared? If one were to argue thus, it would be like comparing dogs and horses—they fall far short. Things are not limited to ten thousand, yet we speak of 'the myriad things'—this is their total number. *Qi* means 'to approximate,' to speak concisely. Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, are but general names for forms and *qi*. Forms and *qi* are not limited to Heaven and Earth, yin and yang—we speak of them by their greatness. The Dao as public principle is also spoken of by its greatness. Though the name 'Dao' already exists, how can it be compared or explained thus? Hence it is said, 'once a name exists, how can it be compared?' Dogs and horses cannot be classed together. *Si* means 'to compare.' If one were to use the name 'Dao' to make comparisons and arguments, it would be like trying to unite dogs and horses—utterly unequal. *Bu ji* means 'not comparable'; *yuan* means 'far off.'"

Shaozhi said: "Within the four directions, encompassing the six conjunctions, whence do the myriad things arise?"

Taigong Diao said: "Yin and yang illuminate and cover, regulate and order each other; the four seasons succeed, give birth to, and destroy each other. Desires and aversions, departures and approaches arise in this way; male and female, paired and joined, are ever thus."

Safety and danger alternate, fortune and misfortune give rise to one another; urgency and leisure rub against each other, gathering and scattering thus take form. These are the names and realities that may be recorded, the subtleties that may be inscribed. Following the sequence of their inherent patterns, rising and operating in mutual employment—when exhausted, they return; when ended, they begin anew. These are the inherent properties of things, the limits of speech, the extent of knowledge—nothing more than the exhaustion of things.

Those who perceive the Dao do not follow what has decayed, nor trace what has arisen—this is where discussion halts.

From whence do the myriad things begin? Hence it is said, "whence do they arise?"

*Xiang zhao* means "to respond"; *xiang gai* means "to converge"; *xiang zhi* means "to wax and wane." The four seasons succeed one another—spring gives life, autumn destroys—each following its time without deviation. From this arise desires and aversions, departures and approaches, the pairing and separation of male and female, safety and danger, fortune and misfortune, urgency and leisure, gathering and scattering. This is to say: only after the existence of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, do the affairs of the human world arise. All these instances are differences within sameness.

*Qiao* means "to rise prominently." *Pian* means "to divide." *Pian he* thus means "division and union." *Yong you* means "constantly present." *Yi cheng* conveys the sense of mutual completion, merely altering a single word for stylistic effect.

From desires and aversions down to gathering and scattering, their names and realities may all be recorded, their subtleties all inscribed—each clearly visible, not only expressible in speech but also recordable in writing. Following the sequence of their times, they order one another, just as yin and yang regulate each other. *Qiao* means "to rise"; rising and operating, they mutually employ one another in waxing and waning. When exhausted, they return to openness; when ended, they begin anew. These are the necessary properties of all things. Speech, when taken to its limit, reaches only this; knowledge, when pursued to its utmost, reaches only this. Exhausting heart and effort, one speaks only of "things"—hence it is said, "nothing more than the exhaustion of things."

Only those who understand the Dao regard what decays and what arises as all returning to nothingness, all returning to spontaneity. Thus their discourse halts at this point—here, there is nothing left to say.

Shaozhi said: "Jizhen’s doctrine of *wu wei* (‘non-action’) and Jiezi’s doctrine of *huo shi* (‘contingent agency’)—which of these two theories accords with reality, and which is partial in its reasoning?"

Taigong Diao said: "The crowing of roosters and the barking of dogs—these are what people know. Yet even one of great wisdom cannot articulate in words the transformations they undergo, nor can anyone fathom in thought what they will do next. If one dissects this principle, its subtlety reaches the unparalleled, its vastness the immeasurable.

The doctrine of *huo shi* (‘contingent agency’) and *wu wei* (‘non-action’) remain entangled with things and ultimately incur error. Jizhen and Jiezi were two contemporaries, each advancing their own theories—one advocating *wu wei* (‘non-action’), the other *huo shi* (‘contingent agency’). *Wu wei* holds that in the unseen depths, there is no governing agency, all is mere coincidence; *huo shi* holds that there is a governing agency, and nothing occurs without its agency—what moves is made to move, what halts is made to halt.

*Accords with reality* means it aligns with the truth; *partial in reasoning* means it grasps only one side. Which of these two is correct, and which is mistaken?

The crowing of roosters and the barking of dogs serve as metaphors for differences. Since human knowledge already varies, even one of great wisdom cannot exhaustively articulate it in words, nor can they fully comprehend it in thought. *What undergoes self-transformation*—this refers to the marvels they themselves perceive. *Du* means "to recite." How can one recite their words and thereby know the marvels they perceive? *What they will do*—what they intend to do. How can one fathom in thought what they intend?

*Si* refers to this principle. If one analyzes this principle, one may speak of it in terms of greatness or smallness—its scope is inexhaustible. *Wu lun* ("without peer") is the extreme of smallness; *bu ke wei* ("unfathomable") is the extreme of vastness. Both doctrines remain entangled with things and ultimately incur error—each has its flaws.

*Huo shi* is substantive; *wu wei* is insubstantial. That which has name and reality resides within things; that which has no name and no reality dwells in the emptiness of things. What can be spoken or conceived only drifts further from the truth.

*Huo shi* is substantive—it posits that in the unseen depths, there is something that governs, which is real. *Wu wei* is insubstantial—it posits that in the unseen depths, there is fundamentally no governing agency, which is empty. If there is reality, then names accompany it—this is to be entangled with things. *Ju* means "to reside"; it means to be within things—hence it is said, "this resides within things." If one speaks of nothingness, then names and realities are both absent, yet what is called "nothing" still exists and cannot be equated with the absence of absence—this too is entanglement with things. Hence it is said, "it dwells in the emptiness of things."

In general, whether one speaks of being or non-being, both can be conveyed in words and conceived in thought—yet both remain bound to language, and thus drift ever further from the Dao.

What has not yet been born cannot be prevented; what has already died cannot be obstructed. Death and life are not distant—their principle cannot be seen. *Ji* means "to forbid." At the inception of what has not yet been born, one cannot prevent its birth; once born, death cannot be defied or obstructed. The principle of life and death is right before us, not at all distant—yet one wishes to see it and cannot. Hence it is said, "their principle cannot be seen."

The doctrines of *huo shi* and *wu wei* are crutches for doubt. Observing their root, their going is without end; seeking their end, their coming is without limit. Without end and without limit—speech reaches nothingness, sharing the same principle as things. If one holds to *huo shi* or *wu wei*, then the doubts of the world arise from these assumptions—how can one be free from entanglement?

*Ben* means "beginning," the time before movement. Observing from the time before movement, one already sees that what goes is without end.

The *mo* means "end," the time when movement ceases after having begun. Observing from the time when movement has ceased, one already sees that what is coming has no end. Viewed thus, only by dissolving into wordlessness can one merge with the myriad things and await the one principle—hence it is said, "speech reaches nothingness, sharing the same principle as things."

*Huoshi* and *wuwei* are the root of speech, accompanying things from beginning to end. The Dao cannot be possessed; what is possessed cannot be without. The name "Dao" is but a borrowed term for its circulation. *Huoshi* and *wuwei* are but partial aspects of things—how could they encompass the great Dao? When these two doctrines are traced to their source, whether one calls it *huoshi* or *wuwei*, they have not yet departed from things, merely seen to accompany them from beginning to end—hence it is said, "accompanying things from beginning to end." If one cannot depart from things, then this is possession—how can one claim the Dao is possessed? Thus it is said, "the Dao cannot be possessed." Yet once it is called possession, how can what is possessed be made to cease? It cannot be separated—hence it is said, "what is possessed cannot be without." Viewed in truth, the term "Dao" is but a borrowed name for its circulation in the world—thus it is said, "the name 'Dao' is but a borrowed term for its circulation." These two doctrines remain mired in things and confined to one side—how can they be called the great Dao? *Yiqu* means "one-sided"; *dafang* means "the great Dao."

Having concluded the above, two further lines are wondrously spoken: If speech suffices, then speaking all day exhausts the Dao; if speech does not suffice, then speaking all day exhausts only things. At the extremity of Dao and things, neither speech nor silence can contain them. Beyond speech and silence, discussion reaches its limit. This saying is the same: if I truly have insight, then calling it speech may fully express the Dao, and speaking all day does no harm—hence it is said, "if speech suffices, speaking all day exhausts the Dao." If I have no insight, then speech does not suffice to express the Dao, and no matter how much one speaks, it remains confined to mere appearances—hence it is said, "if speech does not suffice, speaking all day exhausts only things." The Dao is essence; things are coarse. Seeking at the extremity of essence and coarseness, neither speech nor silence suffices to exhaust them. *Zai* means "to be present," implying they are not contained therein. Within the realm beyond speech and silence, there exists the ultimate discussion. *Jiyi* means "ultimate speech." This is akin to the Buddhist saying: "As I press my finger, the ocean seal emits light; as you raise your mind, the dusts of labor arise first." It is also said, "I am the Dharma King, autonomous in the Dharma"—for one who has realized the Dao, speaking is right, and not speaking is also right; but for one who has not realized the Dao, even if you speak correctly, it is not.

How does this chapter differ from the Inner Chapters? *Nanhua Zhenjing Kouyi*, Scroll Twenty-Six concludes. *Nanhua Zhenjing Kouyi*, Scroll Twenty-Seven, by Yuanzhai Lin XiYi.

**Miscellaneous Chapters: External Things**

External things cannot be relied upon, thus Longfeng was executed, Bigan slain, Jizi feigned madness, Elai died, and Jie and Zhou perished. No ruler fails to desire loyalty from his ministers, yet loyalty does not necessarily earn trust—hence Wu Yun was cast into the river, and Chang Hong died in Shu, his blood stored for three years before transforming into jade. No parent fails to desire filial piety from their children, yet filial piety does not necessarily bring love—thus Xiaoji grieved and Zeng Shen mourned.

External things are matters beyond the self, for they are sought in what lies within. In the time of Jie and Zhou, the worthy and the unworthy alike suffered calamity—this is their unreliability. These are all events of Zhou’s reign, yet Jie is mentioned alongside him; one may infer the meaning. Chang Hong was exiled and returned to Shu, where he disemboweled himself in death. The people of Shu placed his blood in a casket, and after three years, it turned into jade. This account differs slightly from that in the *Zuozhuan*, and its details seem fantastical. When Emperor Yuan of Jin blamed his minister for delayed grain shipments and executed him, the blood spurted upward against a pillar. In Qi, due to the prophecy of the "Bright Moon," Hulü Guang was killed, and his blood on the ground could not be wiped away—such things do occur in the world.

Xiaoji was the son of Gaozong of Yin, driven away by his stepmother. As for Zengzi, no record of his weeping is found; perhaps it refers to his fleeing when his father wielded a large staff. Those who read this book should grasp its intent—matters like these need not be rigidly scrutinized. Loyalty and filial piety are virtues men prize, yet they may bring harm to the self: all are external things that cannot be relied upon.

When wood rubs against wood, fire ignites; when metal is held to fire, it melts. When yin and yang clash, heaven and earth convulse. Thus, thunder and lightning arise, and fire burns within water, even consuming the great locust tree. Wood naturally produces fire when rubbed—today’s boatmen use elm and willow in the same way. Metal, though hardest, flows when exposed to fire. This too speaks to the unreliability of things.

"Great convulsion" means great disorder. During violent thunderstorms, trees may burn—hence "fire within water" that scorches the great locust. It does not speak of other trees but the locust, for the locust can generate fire, as the *Huainanzi* says: "Old locust trees produce fire" (*Fanlun* chapter). Yet it is not only the great locust that burns—all such phenomena arise from yin and yang clashing. Unusual disasters, too, illustrate their unreliability.

In extreme distress, one is trapped on both sides with no escape. *Chen* and *dun* evoke unease and restlessness; unable to find resolution, the heart hangs suspended between heaven and earth. Oppression and stagnation, *weimin* and *chentun*, intertwine; profit and harm grind against each other, generating intense fire. The multitude burns their harmony, and the moon cannot withstand the flames. Thus, one collapses, and the Dao is exhausted.

"Extreme distress" means utmost suffering. "Trapped on both sides" refers to either human or natural calamities—*Ren Jian Shi* speaks of these two, and this is the same idea. *Chen* and *dun* describe fear and disquiet. "Unable to find resolution" means that in extreme distress, with no escape, one’s emotions remain unsettled. "The heart hangs suspended between heaven and earth" speaks of the mind bound and tormenting itself. *Weimin* is gloom; *chentun* is sinking into peril. When profit and harm war within the breast, the inner heat surpasses scorching fire—hence "generating intense fire." These are all worldly people who do not understand the Dao, unaware that external things cannot be relied upon, and thus overtax their minds, burning the harmonious qi within their breasts. Hence, "the multitude burns their harmony." The moon represents one’s nature. In life, people receive from heaven this principle of perfect harmony, like the moon, but when obscured by worldly desires, their flames blaze like fire, and the moon cannot prevail, leading to the burning of harmony. As Shan Gu says, "The original mind is like the sun and moon; profit and desire eclipse it"—this is precisely the meaning. "Collapsing" describes a state of utter release. "The Dao is exhausted" means the heavenly principle is extinguished. For the multitude, drowned in profit and desire, lives without awakening, until the heavenly principle is utterly destroyed.

When Zhuangzi was poor, he went to borrow grain from the Marquis of the River. The marquis said, "Very well. I will soon receive tax revenue from my fief; I will lend you three hundred gold pieces—will that suffice?" Zhuang Zhou flushed with anger and said, "Yesterday, on my way here, I heard someone calling out. I turned to look and saw a crucian carp in the rut of a cart wheel. I asked it, 'Crucian carp, what are you doing here?' It replied, 'I am a wave-minister of the Eastern Sea. Might you have a pint or quart of water to save me?' I said, 'Very well. I am about to travel south to persuade the kings of Wu and Yue, and I will divert the waters of the West River to welcome you—will that do?' The crucian carp flushed with anger and said, 'I have lost my usual element and have nowhere to go. I could be saved with a pint or quart of water, yet you speak like this—you might as well seek me in the dried-fish market!'"

The Marquis of the River, according to the *Shuo Yuan*, was Duke Wen of Wei—though this is not necessarily true. He may have been an official overseeing the river, addressed as "Marquis," or "Marquis" may have been his surname. "Tax revenue from my fief" refers to the tribute from his domain. "Wave-minister" is akin to "water official." This passage likely records a jest from the time, illustrating the modern saying, "Distant water cannot quench a nearby fire." The "dried-fish market" means that by the time the water arrives, the fish will already be dried. "Usual element" refers to what one habitually relies upon.

Task Public Master fashioned a great hook with a massive black rope, baiting it with fifty bullocks. He crouched upon Mount Kuaiji, cast his line into the Eastern Sea, and fished day after day—yet after a full year, he caught nothing. Then, a colossal fish took the bait, dragging the enormous hook and heavy tackle downward. It surged and thrashed, its dorsal fins breaking the surface, white waves towering like mountains, the sea churning violently. The sound shook heaven and earth, terrifying even spirits, its thunderous roar striking fear for a thousand *li* around.

When Task Public Master landed the fish, he butchered and dried it. From the lands east of the Zhi River to the north of Cangwu, none went unsatisfied by its flesh. Yet afterward, those of mediocre talent and street-corner orators all marveled and spread the tale. For those who wield a slender pole with a flimsy line, who chase minnows in shallow streams and guard the tiniest of fish—how could they ever hope to land a great catch? Those who polish trivial words to curry favor with proclamations are as far from true enlightenment as the heavens from the earth.

Thus, those who have never heard of the Task clan’s way are all the more unfit to govern the world. The "massive black rope" was a thick, dark cord. "Bullocks" refers to cattle. The character *xiè* (䱇) is interchangeable with *xiàn* (陷). "The sea churned violently, its sound shaking spirits" describes how the fish’s thrashing stirred the waters, its roar terrifying to behold. "Striking fear" means that even those a thousand *li* away heard its sound and trembled. "Satisfied" means they feasted upon its flesh to their fill. "Mediocre talent" refers to those of shallow judgment and limited vision. "Street-corner orators" are those who repeat hearsay. Knowing only the ordinary and blind to the extraordinary, seeing only the small and missing the great—no wonder they marveled and spread the tale.

A "flimsy line" is a thin cord. "Chase" means to pour. "Shallow streams" refers to minor waterways. "Minnows" are small fish. "Proclamations" are like today’s posted notices—*xiàn* (县) is interchangeable with *xuán* (悬), meaning the displayed decrees or rewards. This describes how petty men adorn their words to ingratiate themselves with authority, seeking to match the standards set forth. Even if they succeed, what is truly gained? Thus, it is said they are far from great attainment.

The vulgar of the world cannot be spoken to of the Way of governing—hence, "the vulgar are all the more unfit to govern the world." "Far" here means "greatly so."

The Confucians who rob graves with *Odes* and *Rites*:
The great Confucian proclaimed in relay: "The east is stirring—how goes the affair?"
The lesser Confucian replied: "The skirt and jacket are not yet undone, but there is a pearl in the mouth."
The *Odes* indeed say:
*"The green, green wheat grows on the hillside mound.
Living, he gave nothing; why hold a pearl in death?"*
Grasping the temples, pressing the chin,
The Confucian used a metal pick to pry open the jaw, gently parting the cheeks—lest the pearl in the mouth be harmed.

This passage likely satirizes those who use the words of the *Odes*, *Rites*, and sages to cloak their deceit. Speech from superior to inferior is called *lú*; from inferior to superior, *jù*. "Proclaimed in relay" means the great Confucian took the lead in instructing his followers. *"The green, green wheat grows on the hillside mound"* describes the grave’s field. *"Living, he gave nothing; why hold a pearl in death?"* mocks the wealthy. This poem consists of only four lines—whether it is an ancient verse or composed by Zhuangzi himself is unknown.

The lines from *"Grasping the temples"* onward are the great Confucian’s instructions to the lesser. "Grasping" means to seize. "Pressing" means to hold down with the hand. "Chin" refers to the area beneath the jaw. "Prying open the jaw" means to force it apart. "Parting" also means to open. The verse says, *"Why hold a pearl in death?"*—so now they take it. This aligns with the meaning of the ancient poem.

When Master Lao Lai’s disciple went out to gather firewood, he encountered Confucius. Returning, he reported: “There is someone over there—tall above, yet hastening below, his back slightly stooped yet his ears set back. His gaze seems fixed on the Four Seas, yet I know not whose son he may be.”

Master Lao Lai said: “That is Qiu.”

He summoned him to come.

When Confucius arrived, Master Lao Lai said: “Qiu, cast off your bodily pride and your cultivated wisdom—only then may you become a true gentleman.”

Confucius bowed and withdrew, his expression altered as he asked: “May my practice still advance?”

Master Lao Lai replied: “To recoil from the sorrow of one age yet startle at the calamities of ten thousand generations—is this not stubborn poverty of spirit, or perhaps a failure of foresight? To take delight in recklessness as kindness brings lifelong disgrace. The conduct of the common people advances thus: drawing one another by fame, binding one another by concealment. Rather than praise Yao and condemn Jie, it were better to forget both and seal away all praise. To turn back is never without harm; to act is never without deviation. The sage hesitates to initiate affairs, yet thereby achieves success in every endeavor. Why then should you persist in bearing this pride to the end?”

"Went out to gather firewood" means he went forth to collect kindling. "Tall above" describes his upper body as long. "Hastening below" refers to his gait, which was swift and resonant. "Slightly" means faintly, indicating his back bore a subtle curvature. "Ears set back" means that when viewed from the front, his ears were not visible. "Gaze fixed on the Four Seas" conveys the sense of gazing anxiously upon the world’s ills. "Bodily pride" refers to the self-importance of one’s bearing. "Cultivated wisdom": "cultivated" means external adornment, while "wisdom" refers to thought and deliberation. "May my practice still advance?" asks whether the Way and its cultivation may still be pursued. "The sorrow of one age" refers to the pitiable suffering of the people of the time.

"Haughty" conveys the meaning of arrogance without concern. It means that while you fret over the affairs of a single era, you apply your mind universally yet remain haughtily indifferent to the calamities you bequeath to later generations. Given this, the exhaustion of the Way is only fitting. "Destitute" means impoverished; "fitting" means proper. Your Way has reached such an impasse because you fail to recognize that worldly affairs transcend the reach of mere strategy—hence the saying, "Have you forgotten the schemes that fall short?" "Forgotten" is synonymous with "lost." "Benevolence" means bestowing kindness upon others; "delight" means seeking the joy of others. To regard the pursuit of others' delight through benevolence as haughtiness, and to be startled by the world’s disapproval of such conduct, is a lifelong disgrace. This is precisely what mediocre people strive for—hence the saying, "the conduct of the common folk advances thus." "Common folk" refers to the mediocre. They vie for reputation, conceal their schemes, and form alliances—such is the way of the mediocre. When Yao and Jie are both forgotten, there is neither blame nor praise—hence the saying, "close off what you praise." "Reverse" means to turn one’s back. To turn one’s back on the natural principle is to engage in nothing but actions that harm the Way. To favor movement over stillness is to indulge in nothing but perverse conduct. The sage does not act thus.

"Hesitant" describes the state of wanting to advance yet holding back. To initiate action with hesitation is to act only when compelled. Precisely because he is without intent, he succeeds time and again. "Burdened" means self-importance. Why do you persist in carrying yourself with such haughty pride? Hence the saying, "How can you remain so burdened by self-importance?" This line is remarkably incisive.

Duke Yuan of Song dreamed in the dead of night of a man with disheveled hair peering through the side gate, who said: "I come from the abyss of Zailu. I was sent by the spirit of the Qing River as an emissary to the River Lord, when the fisherman Yu Qiu caught me." The duke awoke and had the dream interpreted. The diviner said, "This is a divine turtle." The duke asked, "Is there a fisherman named Yu Qiu?" His attendants replied, "There is." The duke said, "Summon Yu Qiu to court." The next day, Yu Qiu appeared at court. The duke asked, "What did you catch while fishing?" Yu Qiu replied, "I caught a white turtle in my net, five feet in circumference." The duke said, "Present your turtle." When the turtle arrived, the duke wavered between killing it and sparing it. Unsure, he consulted the oracle, saying, "Killing the turtle for divination will bring good fortune." He then disemboweled the turtle, drilling seventy-two holes without a single miscast.

Confucius said: "The divine turtle could appear in Duke Yuan’s dream yet could not escape Yu Qiu’s net. Though it knew how to drill seventy-two holes without error, it could not avoid the disaster of being disemboweled. Thus, knowledge has its limits, and divinity has its shortcomings. Even the wisest cannot prevail against the schemes of ten thousand men. Fish do not fear nets but fear pelicans. Discard petty wisdom, and great wisdom becomes clear; abandon the pursuit of goodness, and goodness naturally follows. Infants learn to speak without a great teacher simply by being among those who can speak."

"Side gate" refers to a curved gate. "Zailu" is the name of an abyss. "I was sent by the spirit of the Qing River as an emissary to the River Lord." "Wavering between killing and sparing" describes his repeated hesitation. He consulted the oracle, which deemed killing auspicious, so he killed it. "Seventy-two holes" signifies that even if one were to employ seventy-two stratagems in divination, how could they rival the turtle’s wisdom? This illustrates that if I act with intent, others will respond in kind. Only by relinquishing petty wisdom and entrusting oneself to nature can great wisdom become clear. Abandon the desire to be known for goodness, and goodness will naturally return to you—hence the saying, "Abandon goodness, and goodness follows."

"Stone" is synonymous with "great." A "stone teacher" is a great teacher, one capable of instructing others. Infants learn to speak not by seeking a teacher but by being among those who can speak. The turtle’s wisdom surpasses that of humans, yet it could not save itself—hence the saying, "Knowledge has its limits, and divinity has its shortcomings." This implies that knowledge, when named, has its bounds. The following lines broadly illustrate worldly affairs to substantiate this point.

Even the wisest cannot single-handedly overcome the schemes of ten thousand men. Pelicans catch fish by draining the water and then consuming them all—this is a deliberate harm far worse than a net. The above speaks of how others may act with intent to harm a single individual. Great wisdom and natural goodness are principles of nature. The analogy of learning to speak without instruction is also natural.

Hui Shi said to Zhuangzi, "Your words are useless." Zhuangzi replied, "Only when one understands uselessness can we discuss usefulness. The earth is neither narrow nor small, yet what people use is merely enough to stand upon. If one were to dig beside one’s feet until reaching the Yellow Springs, would the ground still be of use?" Hui Shi said, "It would be useless." Zhuangzi said, "Then the usefulness of uselessness is also clear."

"Digging" means excavation. Beyond the space for one’s feet lies an abyss, rendering it impassable—this echoes the earlier idea of treading only where one does not step. Hence the saying, "the usefulness of uselessness."

From the *Xu Wugui* chapter:
Zhuangzi said: "If a man has the ability to wander freely, can he choose not to? If he lacks the ability, can he wander at all? Those with drifting ambitions and resolute actions—alas, are they not unfit for the tasks of utmost wisdom and profound virtue? Falling and unable to recover, rushing forward without looking back—though they may serve as ruler and minister for a time, when the age changes, they will have no means to belittle one another. Thus, the perfected person does not linger in their conduct."

Those who revere antiquity and disparage the present belong to the ranks of scholars. Yet if we observe the present age through the lens of the age of Xiwei, who could avoid being swept along by the current? Only the perfected person can wander through the world without deviation, following others without losing themselves. They teach without instruction, and their intentions are understood without being imposed.

Those who can wander do so; those who cannot will forever remain unable. This speaks of the world’s having those who attain understanding and those who do not. To wander is to delight in oneself. To drift and flee is to pursue things and forget to return. To cut oneself off is to stand apart from the world in stark distinction. *Task* means *to act*. Those of utmost wisdom and profound virtue, who follow nature, act without the faults of drifting or cutting themselves off. To fall and sink is to be mired in worldly entanglements. To rush like fire is to be swept along by the world’s urgency. All these are bound by worldly burdens and cannot turn back to reflect on themselves—hence the saying, “unable to turn back or look,” meaning they cannot reverse their gaze inward. Though for a time there may be noble and base, ruler and minister, after death what becomes of noble and base? Thus it is said, “Who could avoid being swept along?” Scholars’ view of antiquity and the present begins only with the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. This is a veiled criticism of those ancient rulers. *Deviant* means *partial*. To wander through the world without bias is not to judge right and wrong by antiquity or the present. Though one may blend with the dust and not clash with the world, what one preserves remains intact—hence the saying, “following others without losing oneself.” They teach what they deem correct, but I do not study it; yet I comply with their intent without division between self and other. This speaks of kings and ants alike, all reduced to mounds of earth. Only the perfected person’s conduct leaves no lingering attachment in the world—hence the saying, “the perfected person does not linger in their conduct.” Human nature in antiquity and today is largely the same; where is the difference between simplicity and decadence? Scholars revere antiquity and disparage the present because they do not understand the changes of the world. Xiwei was before the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. If we view the present through the lens of the world’s beginning or high antiquity, all appear as those swept along by currents, having lost their nature. This aligns with the idea of equalizing things and following what is so—hence the saying, “their intentions are understood without being imposed.”

Eyes that penetrate are called *bright*; ears that penetrate are called *keen*; the nose that penetrates is called *acute*; the mouth that penetrates is called *sweet*; the mind that penetrates is called *wise*; wisdom that penetrates is called *virtue*. The Dao does not desire obstruction; obstruction leads to choking, and if choking persists without cease, it treads a path that gives rise to manifold harms. All sentient beings depend on breath for awareness; if it is not ample, the fault does not lie with heaven. Heaven pierces it day and night without cessation, yet people deliberately block its openings. *Penetrate* means *to flow freely*—when one attains the principle of nature and achieves great penetration, what the eyes and ears perceive is true keenness and brightness; what the nose and mouth smell and taste is true acuity and sweetness; what the mind knows is true wisdom, and virtue is the highest virtue. *Obstruction* means blockage and impediment. *Choking* means constriction and lack of flow. *Treads a path* refers to the marks left by footsteps. If my understanding of the Dao is obstructed and choked, unable to awaken, it becomes bound by traces. *Without cease* means delusion without knowing when to stop. Once bound by traces, manifold harms arise. *Breath* means *life*. Life is called *nature*; all possess it, and only with this nature of being born do they have awareness. This awareness depends on breath. All people are thus, yet some act contrary to principle—how could heaven have failed to grant them ample breath? The principle of heaven in the human mind manifests its apertures day and night without end—hence the saying, “Heaven pierces it day and night without cessation.” *Pierces* refers to the apertures of the mind. *Without cessation* means without stop. *Openings* also refer to the apertures of the mind. People, deluded by material desires, block these openings themselves.

The womb has layered membranes; the mind has the wandering of heaven. If a room lacks emptiness, mother and daughter-in-law quarrel; if the mind lacks the wandering of heaven, the six senses vie with one another. The great forests and mountains are good for people, yet even the spirit cannot overcome them. Virtue overflows into fame; fame overflows into haste. Plans rely on recognition; wisdom arises from contention. Firewood is born from guarding; official affairs are settled by accommodating the many. When spring rains come in season, grasses and trees flourish. Hoeing and weeding begin then, and more than half of the planted grasses and trees perish without knowing why. The *womb* is the bladder membrane. Within the body’s flesh lies a layered membrane enclosing it. *Layered membranes* means *spaciousness*. Within the body’s spaciousness, if the mind rules with heavenly principle and delights in itself, it is called *the wandering of heaven*. *Quarrel* means *conflict*. In a cramped house, mother and daughter-in-law are always face-to-face, easily leading to conflict—this is the metaphor for lack of emptiness. When the mind is obstructed and does not know the joy of heavenly principle, the six senses inevitably clash and rebel. The *six senses* are the six roots. Great forests and mountains are pleasing to people because their ears and eyes are habitually narrow, unable to preserve the spirit of nature to overcome external things. Suddenly seeing vast and open land, they rejoice—hence the saying, “even the spirit cannot overcome them.” Seeking fame externally causes virtue to overflow; haste and restlessness cause fame to overflow. Plans depend on recognition; wisdom emerges from contention. Firewood is born from guarding; official affairs are resolved by accommodating the many.

The words coincide with the loss of name. Only with a sense of urgency does one then deliberate on matters of strategy and planning. *Yi* (discussion) is akin to *xian* (tension). Only with a competitive heart do strategies and plans arise. Clinging rigidly without transformation gives rise to the obstinate and joyless. *Guo* means "fruit," "obstruction," or "fullness"; in *Qi Wu* (Equalizing Things), the belly is likened to the fullness of *guo*.

Seeking to make all affairs fitting before assigning tasks leads to the flaw of inevitable obstruction. This speaks of the fool who settles official matters—official matters cannot be settled thus. *Diao nou* are farming tools. When spring rains arrive, grasses and trees sprout vigorously—hence "anger of growth." At this time, if one prepares farming tools for plowing and planting, one must hoe and uproot the grasses and trees. Those grasses and trees, having just taken root with the rain, will be toppled more than halfway. *Dao* is the same as *dǎo* (to fall). As Du Fu said, "Frost topples half the pond’s lotuses"—this is the same *dǎo*. Are those who wield *diao nou* harming the life of grasses and trees? For the sake of farming, they cannot but do so, unaware of the harm to the vitality of growth. This meaning suggests that while life grows, uprooting continues; though grasses and trees are removed, the crops grow anew—thus its success is its destruction, its destruction its success.

Viewed thus, success and failure, gain and loss, life and death, fortune and misfortune—all should be left to nature. Why harbor intentions? From the overflow of virtue into name downward, all are the faults of harboring intentions. If one can be free of such intentions, one attains the heavenly wandering.

Stillness can mend illness; cutting away can rest old age; tranquility can halt haste. Yet these are the tasks of the toiling, not the concerns of the carefree who have never inquired into them. *Jingran* (stillness) means serenity. To mend illness is to shed the old and renew, to abandon the branches and return to the root. If the heart can be serene, past losses can be mended and made whole. *Zì* is pronounced *jiǎn*; *cuì* is pronounced *miè*. *Zī cuì* (cutting away) means removing desires to preserve heavenly principle, allowing one to wander leisurely into old age. *Jù* means urgency. If the heart can be tranquil, haste can be stilled.

These three phrases all speak of recovery after loss, much as Yangzi said: "First illness, then healing." Thus it is said: "Yet these are the tasks of the toiling." This sentence concludes here, meaning that only after experiencing the suffering of being burdened by things can one come to regret; as for those who are carefree and self-content, their hearts are originally at peace and self-sufficient, so they never inquire into such matters. *Yi* means self-contentment. "Not the concerns of the carefree" is akin to saying "not the affairs of the carefree." *Suo* is like *suo* in "that which is without idleness."

The reason the sage startles the world is something the spirit-like person has never inquired into; the reason the worthy startles the age is something the sage has never inquired into; the reason the noble startles the state is something the worthy has never inquired into; the reason the petty person conforms to the times is something the noble has never inquired into. In Yanmen, when a man’s kin died, he was enfeoffed as a court master for his virtuous mourning, and half of his fellow villagers mourned themselves to death. Thus, without ever asking a single question, four more sentences follow. *Xie* is pronounced the same as *hai* (to startle).

The sage governs the world through benevolence and righteousness—this is what startles the world, yet the spirit-like person has no part in it. The worthy astonishes the age with overflowing virtue—yet the sage has no part in it. The nobleman startles his state with reputation and renown—yet the worthy has no part in it. The petty person busily strives to conform to the times—yet the nobleman has no part in it.

Yanmen is a place name. *Shan hui* (virtuous mourning) is filial piety. Having gained rank through filial piety, he became an official master, and his fellow villagers, admiring him, even mourned themselves to death—this speaks of the burden of seeking fame. *Guan shi* (official master) is what we now call an official.

When Yao offered the world to Xu You, Xu You fled; when Tang offered it to Wu Guang, Wu Guang grew angry. When Ji Tuo heard of this, he led his disciples to crouch by the Kuang River, and the feudal lords came to offer condolences. After three years, Shen Tu Di followed suit and drowned himself in the Yellow River. Xu You and Wu Guang gained fame through reclusion, and Ji Tuo, admiring them, likewise led his followers into hiding by the Kuang River. *Cun* is pronounced the same as *dun* (to crouch), with a tone of disdain. Ji Tuo’s intent was that the feudal lords would yield their states to him, yet they merely came to commiserate with his hardship. His own folly was laughable, and three years later, Shen Tu Di, coveting the fame of reclusion, threw himself into the river. This is the extreme to which the burden of seeking fame can lead.

The *quan* is what catches the fish, yet once the fish is caught, the *quan* is forgotten. The *ti* is what snares the hare, yet once the hare is snared, the *ti* is forgotten. Words are what convey meaning, yet once the meaning is grasped, the words are forgotten. Where might I find a man who has forgotten words, that I might speak with him?

The above having been fully expounded, it concludes with the analogy of the *quan* and *ti*, much like the earlier passage’s "words suffice" and "words do not suffice" in structure. The *quan* and *ti* are tools for catching fish and hares—once their purpose is served, they are of no further use. Words lodge meaning; once the meaning is grasped, the words are forgotten. Those who cannot forget words become mired in them and lose the meaning. Only one who has forgotten words may truly be spoken to. This essay, too, is finely wrought. "In the hare" means the intent is to catch the hare.

*Southern Florescence Perfected Scripture: Oral Exegesis*, Scroll Twenty-Seven, concludes.
*Southern Florescence Perfected Scripture: Oral Exegesis*, Scroll Twenty-Eight, by Lin Xi of Yuanzhai.

The "Miscellaneous Chapters" begin with "Parables": nineteen-tenths are parables, seventeen-tenths are reiterations, and *zhi*-words emerge daily, harmonized by the celestial norm.

Nineteen-tenths are parables, borrowing external voices to expound. A father does not act as matchmaker for his own son; his praise carries less weight than that of one who is not his father. The fault is not mine—it is the fault of others. When views align with one’s own, they are affirmed; when they diverge, they are rejected. What accords with oneself is deemed right; what differs is deemed wrong.

At the outset of this chapter, Zhuangzi himself explains the three modes of discourse in his work. *Parables* (*yuyan*) employ one’s own words but attribute them to others. "Nineteen-tenths" signifies that nine-tenths of this text consists of such parables—examples include Nie Que, Wang Ni, and Gengsang Chu. *Reiterations* (*chongyan*) borrow the names of ancient figures to lend weight, such as the Yellow Emperor, Shen Nong, and Confucius. "Seventeen-tenths" indicates that seven-tenths of the text falls into this category.

*Zhi* is a wine vessel. All may drink from it, and the drink has flavor—hence, *zhi*-words. "Emerge daily" means that such words appear in every matter. *He* means to harmonize; *tianni* is the celestial principle. It is to harmonize the hearts of all with the celestial principle. *Jie* means to borrow. What does not originate from oneself but from others is called "external," hence "borrowing external voices to expound."

A father who praises his son to arrange a marriage will not be believed; thus, he must borrow another’s praise—this is the analogy. The fault lies not with me but with others’ lack of trust, which necessitates these parables. If it were seen as coming from me, others would inevitably divide into agreement or disagreement, affirming what aligns with them and rejecting what does not. Whether in accord or discord with oneself—this reflects the self-centered views of others.

"Seventeen-tenths are reiterations" serve to silence debate. To be venerable in years is to precede others, yet without the warp and weft of beginnings and ends to mark one as truly venerable, one is not truly prior. A person who has nothing to offer that surpasses others lacks the Way of humanity. One who lacks the Way of humanity is but a "worn-out person." *Yi* means to cease; *yiyan* means to halt contention. Borrowing the weight of the venerable ensures that listeners dare not dispute, thus stifling debate.

The ancient sage-kings and worthies were all venerable elders. "Warp and weft of beginnings and ends" refers to knowing constancy, knowing change, knowing origins, and knowing conclusions. *Qinian* is the age of one hundred years. Though one’s years may precede others, if one’s learning offers no insight, merely being called a venerable elder by virtue of age does not make one truly prior. It means one has nothing to surpass others. A person who cannot surpass others fails to fulfill the Way of humanity and is but a "worn-out person"—a long-standing, useless figure in the world.

This implies that those I borrow are all venerable and worthy of respect, not merely invoked as predecessors. *Zhi*-words emerge daily, harmonized by the celestial norm, flowing and unfolding to exhaust the years. Without speech, all is equal; equality and speech are not equal, nor are speech and equality. Thus, it is said: "No speech." To speak of "no speech" is to speak all one’s life without ever having spoken; to remain silent all one’s life is never to have failed to speak.

There are origins that make things permissible, origins that make them impermissible; origins that make them so, origins that make them not so. How is it so? It is so in being so. How is it not so? It is not so in being not so. How is it permissible? It is permissible in being permissible. How is it impermissible? It is impermissible in being impermissible. Things inherently have what makes them so; things inherently have what makes them permissible. Nothing is not so; nothing is impermissible.

Were it not for *zhi*-words emerging daily, harmonized by the celestial norm, who could attain such enduring truth? All things are seeds, succeeding one another in different forms, beginning and end like a ring with no discernible order—this is called the celestial balance. The celestial balance is the celestial norm.

*Manyan* means to roam freely and find contentment. *Qiong nian* means to pass the days and months thus. Without speech, all is equal—speech without words returns to a single principle. *Qi* means unity. To express this unity in words and then debate it is to introduce partiality, losing the equality of unity. Thus, it is said: equality and speech are not equal, nor are speech and equality.

Only without speech is there equality—without speech, there are words without intent. To speak all one’s life without ever having spoken is to be without intent in speech. To remain silent all one’s life without ever failing to speak is to awaken to principle even in silence, which is not truly silence.

*You zi* means to have an origin. All that people deem permissible, impermissible, so, or not so arises from particular origins, each affirming what it affirms. How, then, can I determine what is so or permissible? I simply follow what is so and permissible in being so and permissible, and what is not so and impermissible in being not so and impermissible.

Things inherently have what makes them so—each thing has its own rightness. Since each has its own rightness, all things are right, hence "nothing is not so, nothing is impermissible." This idea is discussed in detail in the "Equality of Things" chapter.

"Were it not for *zhi*-words emerging daily, harmonized by the celestial norm, who could attain such enduring truth?" If I did not use natural words to harmonize all voices, aligning with their judgments of right and wrong, how could I ensure lasting agreement? For the principle of nature is unassailable across all ages.

All things share a common origin in creation, yet their different forms succeed one another between heaven and earth.

Then humans take grass as grass, trees as trees, birds as birds, and beasts as beasts—seeing only their differing forms while unaware that all emerge from the same primordial *qi*, their origin being one. All things within heaven and earth follow a cycle of coming and going, beginning and ending, as if in ceaseless rotation. The marvel of their order eludes human comprehension, for it cannot be fully known. This is called the "Celestial Equality."

"Equality" means sameness; what is the same in the celestial principle is thus called *Celestial Equality*. Zhuangzi said to Huizi: "Confucius lived sixty years, and in those sixty years, he transformed sixty times. What he once deemed right, he later deemed wrong. How can we know that what he now calls right is not what he deemed wrong at fifty-nine?" Huizi replied: "Confucius diligently applied his will to serve knowledge." Zhuangzi said: "Confucius has abandoned that path, though he has never spoken of it. Confucius once said: 'One receives talent from the Great Root and returns to the numinous to live. When one sings, it accords with the pitch; when one speaks, it accords with the law. When profit and righteousness are arrayed before one, likes and dislikes, right and wrong merely submit to others’ words. If one could make others submit in their hearts without daring to oppose, one would establish the settled order of the world. Alas! Alas! How could I ever reach his level?'"

"Serving knowledge" means serving through action. "Knowledge" refers to intellectual perception. To exert the mind in pursuit of intellectual perception is to engage in broad learning. "Abandoned" means to depart. Zhuangzi means that Confucius had already left behind the pursuit of broad learning to advance toward the Dao, though he had never spoken of this to others. When Zhuangzi cites "Confucius said," he is quoting Confucius’s own words, meaning that Confucius once spoke thus.

"Receiving talent from the Great Root" is like saying "receiving one’s nature from the Great Origin." The "Great Root" is the Creator. "Numinous" refers to the nature of awareness. "Returns" means to revert. Only by returning to the original nature of awareness can one fulfill the Way of human life, hence "returns to the numinous to live." "Sings" also means "speaks." "Pitch" is the law. "Accords" means that all speech conforms to principle. When profit and righteousness are placed before one, and one’s likes and dislikes, right and wrong, merely submit to others’ words, one may win verbal assent but not heartfelt submission. Only by relinquishing profit and righteousness and forgetting likes and dislikes, right and wrong, can one make others submit in their hearts without daring to oppose, thus establishing the settled order of the world. *Jiang* (悟) means opposition; to stand face-to-face is to set oneself in accord while others oppose. The *Rites of Zhou* says, "to receive the opposition of the feudal lords," meaning those who come toward me are deemed opposition.

After praising Confucius’s words, Zhuangzi sighed to Huizi, saying, "Alas! Alas! How could I ever reach the level of that Confucius?" From this alone, it is clear that Zhuangzi was not one who failed to revere our sage. Zengzi took office twice, and his heart transformed twice. He said: "When I served while my parents were alive, three *fu* of grain brought me joy; later, when I served with three thousand *zhong*, I could not reach my parents, and my heart grieved." A disciple asked Confucius: "Can Zeng Shen be said to be free of entanglement in fault?" Confucius replied: "He is already entangled. How could one free of entanglement feel sorrow?" To him, three *fu* and three thousand *zhong* were like watching sparrows, mosquitoes, and gnats pass before him.

"Not reaching" means not attaining one’s parents. "Free of entanglement in fault" means: was Zengzi’s statement entangled in fault or free of it? The doubt arises from his two transformations—joy and sorrow. "Already entangled" means that even this joy and sorrow are entanglements. If one were free of entanglement, the weight of external things passing before one would be like birds, insects, and gnats—how could one feel joy or sorrow over them? To feel joy or sorrow is to have a heart.

Yan Cheng Ziyou said to Dongguo Ziqí: "Since I heard your words, after one year, I became rustic; after two years, I followed; after three years, I penetrated; after four years, I became as things; after five years, I came; after six years, spirits entered; after seven years, heaven was completed; after eight years, I knew neither death nor life; after nine years, I attained the Great Mystery."

"After one year, rustic" means returning to simplicity. "After two years, following" means compliance—no opposition to right or wrong, likes or dislikes. "After three years, penetrating" means thorough penetration. "After four years, as things" means becoming like withered wood or dead ashes. "After five years, coming" means that within stillness, there is also non-stillness—what Chan Buddhists call "the great death and yet alive." "Spirits entered" means embracing creation within one’s breast. "Heaven completed" means becoming one with heaven. "Knowing neither death nor life" means being at ease in every situation. "Great Mystery" means the ultimate profundity. From one to nine years, these are merely stages in sequence; such matters cannot be measured by years.

To regard life as existence is death. Exhort the lord with his death, for it has its origin. Yet life is yang—it has no origin. Is this truly so? Where does it go? Where does it not go? These lines speak of the principle of neither life nor death.

"To regard life as existence" means that if one takes life as real, then death follows. To hold the view of life and death is self-centered. If one urges impartiality, one should know that among the Creator’s works, nothing is immortal—hence "exhort the lord with his death." Yet to call it death is to give it an origin. If death has an origin, then seek life at its first stirring—it fundamentally has no origin. Since its beginning is without life, how can there be death? Yang is the beginning of movement. Thus, the principle of life and death is as such—who knows if it is truly so?

Where it goes, it is so; where it does not go, it is not so. Yet when observed in its entirety, where is it so? Where is it not so? To call it existence is not so; to call it non-existence is also not so. Thus, is it truly so? Where does it go? Where does it not go?

Heaven has its celestial reckonings; earth has its human records. Where then shall I seek it? None know its end—how can it be said there is no mandate? None know its beginning—how can it be said there is a mandate? When there is resonance, how can there be no spirits? When there is no resonance, how can there be spirits?

Celestial reckonings refer to the movements of stars, constellations, sun, and moon, recorded in almanacs and calculations. Human records refer to the traces of human activity that can be verified, much like geographical treatises. Yet can one truly exhaust the principles of heaven and earth by seeking them in celestial reckonings and human records? Thus, it is said: Where shall I seek it?

Between heaven and earth, days pass and months flow—who can know their end? As their movement continues, there must be a Creator. How then can it be said there is no mandate? Yet in the primordial vastness, originally there was nothing. How can it be said there is a mandate?

Morning must yield to evening; cold must yield to heat. When the time comes, qi responds with utmost precision. Given such resonance, how can it be said there are no spirits? Yet the humble are not always blessed, the virtuous do not always live long. Between the seen and unseen, there are times when resonance fails. How then can it be said there are spirits? These lines elucidate the unknowability of the Creator.

The multitude of *wangliang* asked the shadow: "Before, you were bowed; now, you are upright. Before, your hair was tied; now, it is loose. Before, you were seated; now, you are standing. Before, you were walking; now, you are still. Why is this?"

The shadow replied: "Hush—why do you ask such trivial things? I have this, yet I know not why. I am like the cicada’s molted husk, the snake’s sloughed skin—similar, yet not the same. Fire and sunlight are my gathering; darkness and night are my succession. That which I depend upon—how much more so for those who depend on what depends? When it comes, I come with it; when it goes, I go with it. When it is strong and yang, I am strong and yang with it. What question is there in this?"

"Hush" conveys the sense of something fleeting and indistinct. "Trivial" means slight or cursory—why ask such a hasty question? What I possess is fundamental, yet I do not know why it is so. Thus, it is said: I have this, yet I know not its origin.

The cicada has transformed, yet its husk remains; the snake has transformed, yet its sloughed skin remains. This is to liken the movement of form to the life of cicadas and snakes, and to compare the shadow to the shed husk and skin. "Similar, yet not the same" means that while this comparison is close, it is not exact. When within the light of sun and fire, this shadow exists—thus it is said to gather and assemble. When day turns to shade without sun, and night falls without fire, the shadow becomes invisible—this is its succession and departure. "That" refers to form; "I" refers to the shadow. It is said: what I depend upon is that—thus, "that upon which I depend." Yet the movement of form itself also depends on something else—hence, "how much more so for those who depend on what depends." "Strong yang" is movement. Form moves by depending on the qi of strong yang; that by which form comes and goes is strong yang. If that moves by strong yang, I follow it—yet what strong yang is, form itself does not know. Why then do you ask me?

This passage parallels the *Equalizing Things*, but adds the explanations of strong yang, fire, and sun—merely playing with the brush. It is what Chan Buddhists call "repeating the gāthā."

Yang Ziju traveled south to Pei, while Lao Dan journeyed west to Qin. They met by chance at Liang, where Laozi looked up to the sky and sighed mid-journey, saying: "At first, I thought you could be taught, but now you cannot." Yang Ziju made no reply. Upon reaching their lodging, he presented water for washing, a towel, and a comb, removed his shoes outside the door, and advanced on his knees, saying: "Earlier, your disciple wished to ask you, Master, but you were walking without pause, so I dared not. Now that there is a pause, I beg to ask: what is my fault?" Laozi said: "You are haughty and overbearing—with whom can you dwell? The purest white seems tarnished; the greatest virtue seems insufficient." Yang Ziju’s expression changed abruptly, and he said: "I respectfully receive your instruction."

When he had gone before, the innkeepers welcomed and saw him off at their home; the master of the house held the mat, his wife held the towel and comb, the guests avoided the seats, and the cook avoided the stove. When he returned, the innkeepers contended with him for seats. "What is my fault?" means: the Master said I could not be taught—where does my fault lie? "Haughty and overbearing" describes a constrained and uneasy demeanor. "With whom can you dwell?" means that he had not forgotten the distinction between self and others, always appearing as if dwelling with others. "The purest white seems tarnished" conveys the idea of brightness concealing itself. "The greatest virtue seems insufficient" means that though one possesses it, one does not presume upon it. "Welcomed and saw off" refers to escorting him. "The master of the house" is the host of the inn. "Holding the mat" and "holding the towel and comb" are acts of service. "The cook" is the one who tends the fire. "Avoiding the seats" and "avoiding the stove" show respect. "Contending for seats" means they no longer knew to respect him. Before hearing Laozi’s words, he had an air of self-importance and self-regard, so people saw him and respected him. After receiving this awakening, he withdrew and concealed himself, and people saw him as an ordinary man. The composition of this chapter is also refined.

**Miscellaneous Chapters: "Yielding the Throne"**

Yao offered the realm to Xu You, but Xu You declined.
He then offered it to Zizhou Zhi Fu, who replied: "Were I to be made Son of Heaven, it would be acceptable. Yet I happen to suffer from a hidden affliction and am presently tending to it—I have no leisure to govern the realm."
The realm is of utmost weight, yet he would not let it harm his life—how much less would he allow other things to do so!
Only one who takes no account of the realm may be entrusted with it.

Shun offered the realm to Zizhou Zhi Bo, who said: "I happen to suffer from a hidden affliction and am presently tending to it—I have no leisure to govern the realm."
Thus, the realm is a great vessel, yet one does not exchange life for it—this is how those who possess the Dao differ from the common.

A "hidden affliction" is what we now call a concealed malady.
One who "takes no account of the realm" is one who does not desire to be Son of Heaven; only such a person may be entrusted with it—this is one who possesses the realm yet does not cling to it.
"Differs from the common" means he is not like the worldly.

Shun offered the realm to Shan Juan, who said: "I stand amid the cosmos: in winter, I wear furs; in summer, I wear fine linen. In spring, I plow and sow, and my body is sufficient for labor; in autumn, I reap and gather, and my person is sufficient for rest and sustenance. I rise with the sun and rest at its setting. I wander freely between heaven and earth, and my heart is content. Why should I take the realm for myself? Alas, you do not know me!"
He refused and departed, entering the deep mountains, and none knew his whereabouts.

Shun offered the realm to his friend, the farmer of Shihu, who said: "How earnest is the lord’s conduct—a man who preserves his strength!" Yet he deemed Shun’s virtue not yet perfected. Thereupon, he and his wife, carrying their child, fled to the sea and never returned.
"Earnest" (*juanjuan*) describes the appearance of one who toils on his own behalf.
"Preserves his strength" means to labor diligently.
"Virtue not yet perfected" refers to a virtue that is not yet natural.
Both fled: the wife bore the child upon her head, the husband carried them on his back.

These two passages lack concluding remarks, for their meaning is the same as the preceding.

King Tai of the Zhou dwelt in Bin. The Di tribes attacked, offering furs and silks, but he would not accept; they offered dogs and horses, but he would not accept; they offered pearls and jades, but he would not accept. What the Di sought was land.
King Tai Dan Fu said: "To dwell with a man’s elder brother and kill his younger brother, to dwell with a man’s father and kill his son—I cannot bear it. Go, all of you, and dwell here. What difference is there between serving me and serving the Di?"
Moreover, I have heard that one must not harm what is nurtured for the sake of what nurtures it.
Thereupon, he took up his staff and departed. The people followed in droves, and he established a state beneath Mount Qi.
King Tai Dan Fu may be called one who knew how to honor life.
One who honors life does not, though rich and noble, let what nurtures injure the self; though poor and lowly, does not let profit burden the body.
Yet men of this age who occupy high office and exalted rank all fear losing them. Seeing profit, they lightly cast aside their lives—is this not delusion?
"What nurtures" refers to what one relies upon for self-sustenance—namely, land.
"What is nurtured" refers to the common people.
"Honoring life" means valuing the self and treating external things as light.

This is a rebuke to those of the time who fretted over loss.

The people of Yue murdered their ruler for three generations. Prince Sou, troubled by this, fled into the cinnabar cave, and Yue was left without a ruler. When they could not find Prince Sou, they pursued him to the cave. He refused to emerge, so they smoked him out with mugwort and bore him forth in a jade carriage.
Prince Sou grasped the reins and mounted the chariot, gazing heavenward and crying: "Lordship! Lordship! Can you not spare me this?"
Prince Sou did not hate lordship—he hated the calamity that came with it.
Such a one may be called one who would not let the state harm his life.
This was indeed what the people of Yue desired in a ruler.
"Lordship! Lordship!" means "Do you take me for a lord?"
Only one who has no intention of being lord may be entrusted with the state—thus it is said that he was what the people of Yue desired in a ruler.

Han and Wei contended over encroached land. Master Hua Zi visited Marquis Zhao of Han, who wore a troubled expression.
Master Hua Zi said: "Suppose the world inscribed a contract before you, with these words: 'If you seize it with your left hand, your right hand will be lost; if you seize it with your right hand, your left hand will be lost. Yet whoever seizes it shall possess the realm—could you seize it?'"
Marquis Zhao said: "I would not."
Master Hua Zi said: "Excellent. From this we see that both arms are weightier than the realm, and the body is weightier than both arms. Han is far lighter than the realm, and what you now contend over is far lighter than Han. Yet you grieve, harming your life and body over what you cannot obtain."
The marquis said: "Well said! Many have instructed me, but never have I heard such words."
Master Hua Zi may be called one who knew the measure of light and heavy.

"Seize" (*jue*) means to grasp and take.
"A contract" (*ming*) is like an agreement.
"Lost" means severed and gone.
To seize the contract would be to gain the realm, yet one who cherishes his body would not do so—how much less when Han, compared to the realm, is so light!
To grieve over not obtaining it, to the point of harming one’s life and body, is worse than losing an arm.
Thus it is said he knew the measure of light and heavy.

This analogy offers great benefit to the worldly; this passage resembles the "Inner Chapters."

The Lord of Lu heard that Yan He was a man who had attained the Dao, so he sent an envoy bearing gifts to approach him first. Yan He lived in a humble lane, wearing coarse cloth and personally tending oxen. When the envoy from Lu arrived, Yan He received him himself. The envoy asked, "Is this the home of Yan He?" Yan He replied, "This is the home of He." The envoy presented the gifts, but Yan He responded, "I fear the messenger may have misheard and would thus incur blame. It would be better to verify this." The envoy returned, confirmed the matter, and came back to seek him again—only then did Yan He accept. Thus, one like Yan He truly detested wealth and honor.

Therefore it is said: The true essence of the Dao is for cultivating the self; its remnants and leavings may be used for governing the state; its dregs and chaff may be used for ordering the world. From this perspective, the achievements of emperors and kings are but the surplus affairs of sages—never the means to perfect the self or nurture life. Yet today, the worldly gentlemen often endanger their bodies and abandon their lives to pursue external things—is this not lamentable?

Whenever the sage acts, he must examine both his purpose and his means. Now suppose there were a man here who used the Marquis of Sui’s pearl to shoot a sparrow a thousand *ren* high—surely the world would laugh at him. Why? Because what he employed was weighty, while what he sought was light. How much more so is life itself, which far exceeds the value of the Marquis of Sui’s pearl!

*Ju bu* refers to coarse cloth. *Mishearing* means hearing incorrectly. *Tu zha* (dregs and chaff) is pronounced with the first syllable as *che* and the second as *zhaya*—it signifies worthless residue. The implication is that the governance of the world and the state, within the Dao of the sage, are mere surplus affairs. The self is the foundation of the world and the state; cultivating the self enables one to govern the world and the state. This is the teaching of the sages.

Zhuangzi’s words make such distinctions, leading people to believe he divides things into two separate realms—refined and coarse—yet they fail to grasp his true intent: that one who knows the Dao does not allow external things to burden his fundamental mind. For example, Yao’s heart was not set on the imperial carriage, and Shun and Yu held the world as if it were not theirs. Only thus can one fully realize the governance of non-action. However, his rhetoric may at times be overly emphatic.

The phrases "remnants and leavings" and "dregs and chaff" arise from surplus affairs, much like saying "dust, chaff, and husks can be molded into Yao and Shun." His language sometimes exceeds proper bounds, and this is one such case. Wang Anshi’s scholarship truly took these as two separate matters, attempting to apply them by emphasizing the "remnants and leavings" and "dregs and chaff"—hence Zhu Xi’s thorough refutation.

Zhuangzi’s excessive rhetoric may mislead later generations, yet his true intent was otherwise. To endanger one’s body and abandon one’s life in pursuit of external things is to allow external things to burden the mind.

*Suo yi zhi* means "the purpose of going." The two phrases *suo yi zhi* and *suo yi wei* express a single idea. No one would willingly use a pearl to shoot a sparrow, yet people fail to recognize when external things burden their bodies. This analogy is most clear and apt; this passage, too, resembles the "Inner Chapters."

Liezi was poor, his countenance bearing the hue of hunger. A guest mentioned this to Zi Yang, the minister of Zheng, saying, "Lie Yukou is a man of the Dao. That he dwells in your state yet suffers poverty—could it be that you, my lord, do not favor scholars?" Zi Yang immediately ordered an official to send him grain. When Liezi saw the messenger, he bowed twice and declined. The messenger departed, and upon entering his home, Liezi’s wife struck her breast and said, "I have heard that the wife and children of a man of the Dao all enjoy ease and happiness. Now you bear the look of hunger, yet when the lord sent you food, you refused it—is this not fate?" Liezi laughed and said to her, "The lord does not know me personally. He sent me grain based on another’s words, and if he were to blame me, he would do so based on another’s words as well. This is why I did not accept it."

In the end, the people indeed rose in rebellion and killed Zi Yang. Zi Yang was the minister of Zheng, and Liezi was a native of Zheng. To send grain based on another’s words shows he did not truly know him; if he did not truly know him, then praise could be trusted, but so too could slander. This explanation is most apt and aligns with the *Liezi*.

King Zhao of Chu lost his state, and the butcher Shuo fled alongside him. When the king regained his state and was about to reward those who had followed him, he came to the butcher Shuo. The butcher Shuo said, "When Your Majesty lost the state, I lost my butchery. Now that Your Majesty has regained the state, I have regained my butchery. My rank and emolument have already been restored—what reward is there to give?"

The king said, "Insist that he accept it."

The butcher Shuo replied, "When Your Majesty lost the state, it was not my fault, so I dared not accept punishment. Now that Your Majesty has regained the state, it is not my merit, so I dare not claim reward."

The king said, "Let me see him."

The butcher Shuo said, "According to the laws of Chu, one must have performed great deeds to receive a grand reward before being granted an audience. Now, my wisdom was insufficient to preserve the state, and my courage was insufficient to die in battle against the enemy. When the Wu army entered Ying, I fled from danger to avoid the enemy—it was not that I intentionally followed Your Majesty. Now, if Your Majesty wishes to set aside the law and break the covenant to see me, this is not what I wish to be heard throughout the world."

The king said to Sima Ziqi, "The butcher Shuo dwells in lowly circumstances yet upholds principles of the highest order. You, sir, should extend to him the position of the Three Standards."

The butcher Shuo said, "I know that the position of the Three Standards is nobler than the butcher’s stall, and that the emolument of ten thousand *zhong* is richer than the butcher’s profit. Yet how could I greedily accept rank and emolument and cause my lord to gain a reputation for reckless bestowal? I dare not accept. I wish to return to my butcher’s stall." Thus, he declined and did not accept.

When the king regained his state, Shuo regained his butchery—each returned to his proper place and duty.

The Three Standards refer to the Three Dukes. The carriages and robes of the Three Dukes each bear distinct banners, hence the term "Three Standards." This passage is also excellent.

Yuan Xian dwelled in Lu, his home a wattle hut with walls barely spanning a few paces, its roof thatched with wild grass. The door, woven of brambles, was incomplete; the hinge was made of mulberry wood, and the two windows were fashioned from earthen jars. Coarse cloth stuffed the gaps to block wind and rain. Above leaked, below dampened, yet he sat upright, plucking the strings of his zither.

Zi Gong arrived in a grand carriage, its canopy deep purple, its lower robes pure white, the axle so wide it could not pass through the narrow lane. He came to visit Yuan Xian. Yuan Xian, wearing a hat of birch bark, dragging his hempen shoes, and leaning on a staff of wild thorn, answered the door. Zi Gong said, "Alas! Master, what ails you?" Yuan Xian replied, "I have heard that to lack wealth is called poverty, but to study and fail to practice is called affliction. I am poor, not afflicted."

Zi Gong stepped back, his face flushed with shame. Yuan Xian smiled and said, "To act in pursuit of worldly favor, to befriend for mutual gain, to study for others’ sake, to teach for personal profit, to feign benevolence and righteousness as a cloak for deceit, to adorn oneself with carriages and fine horses—these are things I cannot bear to do."

The thatch refers to the roof covered with grass. Both rooms of the husband and wife had windows made from earthen jars, hence "two rooms with jar-windows." A window is an opening chiseled into a wall to admit light. Coarse cloth stuffed the windows to ward off wind and rain, hence "coarse cloth as a seal." *Xian* means to strum the zither or lute. *Kuang zuo* means to sit upright. *Gan* is a deep blue-red. The outer garment was white, hence "white as the outer robe." The carriage could not pass through the lane, meaning the lane was too narrow for its width. *Hua guan* refers to a hat made of birch bark. *Zong lv* means to drag one’s shoes. "To act in pursuit of worldly favor" describes conduct aimed at currying favor. "To befriend for mutual gain" means associating with unworthy people. To study for others rather than oneself, to teach for profit rather than the Dao, to use benevolence and righteousness as a pretext for villainy—this is what is meant by "the treachery of benevolence and righteousness."

Zengzi lived in Wei, his quilted robe without an outer layer, his complexion sallow and swollen, his hands and feet calloused. For three days, he did not kindle a fire; for ten years, he did not make new clothes. When he straightened his hat, the cord snapped; when he grasped his lapel, his elbow showed; when he put on his shoes, the heels split. Yet as he dragged his tattered hem and sang the *Odes of Shang*, his voice filled heaven and earth, resonant as metal or stone. Neither the Son of Heaven could make him a subject, nor the feudal lords befriend him. Thus, those who cultivate the will forget the body; those who cultivate the body forget profit; those who attain the Dao forget the mind.

The quilted robe refers to today’s padded clothing. "Without an outer layer" means the outer fabric was torn, exposing the padding. *Zhong kuai* describes a bloated, puffy appearance. When he straightened his hat, the cord broke—the cord being what secures the hat. "Elbow showed" means the sleeves of his lapel were torn. "Heels split" means the backs of his shoes were broken. *Ye zong* means to drag one’s hem as one walks. *Shang song* refers to the songs he sang. "Resonant as metal or stone" describes the rhythmic quality of his voice. "To cultivate the will and forget the body" means not to burden the mind with concerns for bodily care. "To cultivate the body and forget profit" means not to exhaust oneself chasing external things. "To attain the Dao and forget the mind" means that without a mind, one approaches the Dao.

Confucius said to Yan Hui, "Hui, come here. Your family is poor and your station low—why do you not seek office?" Yan Hui replied, "I do not wish to serve. Outside the city walls, I have fifty *mu* of fields, enough to provide gruel and porridge; within the city walls, ten *mu* of land, enough to yield silk and hemp. Playing the zither brings me joy, and the Dao I study from you is enough to bring me happiness. I do not wish to serve."

Confucius’s expression changed solemnly as he said, "Excellent, Hui’s intent! I have heard that one who knows contentment is not burdened by profit; one who truly possesses self-mastery is not fearful of loss; one whose conduct is cultivated within feels no shame in any position. I have recited these words for a long time, but only now do I see them in you. This is my gain."

"Outside the city walls" refers to fields; "within the city walls," to gardens. Yan Hui may not have actually possessed these, and Zhuangzi’s words may not be entirely trustworthy. "The Dao I study from you is enough to bring me happiness"—what is this happiness? Thus, the Cheng brothers often taught people to seek the source of Yan Hui’s joy, a matter not to be glossed over lightly. "One who knows contentment is not burdened by profit" means that one who is content with oneself has no need of external things. *Shen* means "truly." If what is within oneself is genuinely sufficient, then the loss of external things brings neither joy nor fear. "No shame in any position" means not feeling ashamed when others do not recognize one’s worth. "I have recited these words for a long time, but only now do I see them in you" means that though he had long heard these words, he now saw them embodied in a person. "This is my gain" refers to truly having gained a friend.

The Prince Mou of Zhongshan said to Shanzi, "Though my body dwells by rivers and seas, my heart remains beneath the palace gates of Wei—what is to be done?" Shanzi replied, "Value life. If you value life, profit will seem light."

The Prince Mou of Zhongshan said, "Though I know this, I cannot overcome myself." Shanzi said, "If you cannot overcome yourself, then follow your inclinations—your spirit will not resent it. If one cannot overcome oneself yet forcibly resists, this is called double injury. A doubly injured person does not belong among the long-lived."

Prince Mou of Wei was the son of a ruler of ten thousand chariots, and his retreat to mountain caves was more difficult than for a commoner. Though he had not yet attained the Dao, he could be said to have grasped its essence. "My heart remains beneath the palace gates" means he had not yet forgotten wealth and rank. "Value life and profit will seem light" means that when one recognizes the preciousness of the original mind, external things grow light. "Though I know this, I cannot overcome myself" means that principle had not yet triumphed over desire. "If you cannot overcome yourself, then follow" means that if the mind cannot yet master itself, one should temporarily yield and comply. This refers to the occasional arising of such thoughts while dwelling by rivers and seas—one need not forcibly suppress them. Forcible suppression may inwardly harm the spirit or even lead to illness, hence "if you cannot overcome yourself, then follow."

To follow is to comply. Complying harms not the spirit, hence "the spirit suffers no aversion." Inability to master oneself is the first injury, occurring when such thoughts arise. If, at the moment these thoughts emerge, one forcibly suppresses and refuses to comply, the strain of self-restraint becomes a second injury—thus "double injury." This is no way to preserve one’s life. Those who do not belong to the long-lived are not counted among their kind.

Wei Mou, though a prince, became a recluse, making self-mastery all the harder for him. Though his learning had not yet attained the Dao, he could be said to have grasped its intent. These words align with the *Doctrine of the Mean*’s encouragement to persevere in practice.

Confucius, beset between Chen and Cai, went seven days without cooked food, subsisting on a broth of greens without grain. His complexion grew gaunt, yet he still strummed and sang in his chamber. Yan Hui picked vegetables. Zilu and Zigong spoke to one another: "The Master was twice driven from Lu, his traces erased in Wei, his tree felled in Song, and now he is destitute between Shang and Zhou, besieged in Chen and Cai. Those who would kill him face no penalty; those who would trample him meet no prohibition. Yet he never ceases his strumming and singing—can a noble person be so shameless?"

Yan Hui, unable to respond, entered and told Confucius. Confucius pushed aside his zither and sighed deeply: "You and Ci are petty men. Summon them, and I will speak to them." Zilu and Zigong entered. Zilu said, "In such straits, one may truly be called destitute." Confucius replied, "What words are these? When a noble person is at one with the Dao, that is success; when cut off from the Dao, that is destitution. Now I embrace the Dao of benevolence and righteousness yet suffer the calamities of a disordered age—how can this be called destitution? Thus, in self-examination I am not cut off from the Dao; facing adversity, I do not lose my virtue. When bitter cold arrives and frost and snow descend, I know the pine and cypress remain verdant. The straits of Chen and Cai may yet prove fortunate for me."

Confucius then calmly returned to his zither and strummed and sang. Zilu, inspired, took up his shield and danced. Zigong said, "I did not know the height of heaven or the depth of earth!" Those of old who attained the Dao found joy in adversity and joy in success—their joy lay not in adversity or success. When the Dao and its virtue are thus realized, adversity and success become as regular as the seasons of cold and heat, wind and rain.

Thus, Xu You found delight by the Ying River, and Gong Bo found contentment on Mount Qiu. "A broth of greens without grain" means there were vegetables but no rice. "Trample" means to oppress. "No prohibition" means no one deemed it a crime.

When the cold of winter arrives, one knows the flourishing of the pine and cypress—this is what is meant by "only in the cold of the year does one know the pine and cypress." Through the straits of Chen and Cai, the Dao of the sage in adversity could manifest itself, becoming a model for later generations. Thus it is said, "How fortunate for me."

*Xiaoran* suggests a carefree and unconstrained manner. "Returned to his zither" means he took up the zither again to play. *Guran* means leaping with joy. Zilu heard these words and rejoiced. The following lines from Zigong indicate his enlightenment.

Mount Qiushou is the name of a mountain. The so-called Gong Bo may not refer to the Gonghe Regency; these are likely allegories, not to be taken as factual. The intent is that Zigong, moved by joy, spoke thus, praising those like Xu You who could remain reclusive to the end, finding joy in adversity through the Dao. Xu You and Gong Bo are invoked through Zigong’s words.

During the Shang and Zhou dynasties, the Zhou capital included the former lands and people of Shang. Shun offered the world to his friend, the Northerner Wuze. Wuze said, "How strange is the ruler’s conduct! Dwelling in the fields and yet frequenting Yao’s court—this alone would have been improper. Now he further seeks to defile me with his disgraceful conduct. I am ashamed to see him." Thereupon he cast himself into the Clear and Cold Abyss.

"Would have been improper" means Shun’s actions were already wrong. Your own faults are yours alone to bear—why further seek to sully me? Thus he drowned himself. No other records attest to this event; it too is likely allegorical. *Ru xing* means "defiled virtue."

When Tang was about to attack Jie, he consulted Bian Sui, who said, "This is not my affair." Tang asked, "Who then is suitable?" Bian Sui replied, "I do not know." Tang then consulted Wu Guang, who said, "This is not my affair." Tang asked, "Who then is suitable?" Wu Guang replied, "I do not know." Tang said, "What of Yi Yin?" Wu Guang answered, "He is strong and enduring, patient of disgrace. I know nothing beyond this." Tang then conspired with Yi Yin, overthrew Jie, and succeeded him. He offered the throne to Bian Sui, who declined, saying, "When the ruler plotted against Jie, he consulted me—he must have thought me a villain. Now that he has triumphed, he offers me the throne—he must think me greedy. I live in a chaotic age, and a ruler without the Dao twice seeks to defile me with his disgraceful conduct. I cannot bear to hear such things again." Thereupon he cast himself into the Thicket Waters and drowned.

Tang then offered the throne to Wu Guang, saying, "The wise plan, the martial execute, the benevolent rule—this is the ancient Way. Why do you not ascend?" Wu Guang declined, saying, "To depose a ruler is unrighteous; to kill the people is unbenevolent. Others bear the hardship while I enjoy the gain—this is dishonorable. I have heard that one does not accept emoluments from unrighteous sources, nor tread the soil of a lawless age. How much less would I accept such honor? I cannot bear to witness this any longer."

Then he strapped stones to himself and drowned in the Lu River. "Strong in effort" signifies the intent to achieve. "Enduring disgrace" means tolerating the world’s defilements.

"Martial ones complete it" refers to those who succeed through war. "The benevolent dwell in it" describes Wu Guang as a man of benevolence. Bian Sui and Wu Guang were both recluses of antiquity, yet their act of drowning themselves remains unverifiable—perhaps it was merely allegory.

In the rise of the Zhou, two scholars dwelt in Guzhu, named Boyi and Shuqi. The two conferred, saying: "We have heard there is one in the west who seems to possess the Dao. Let us go and observe." Arriving at Qiyang, King Wu learned of them and sent Shu Dan to meet them, proposing an oath: "I shall double your rank and appoint you to the highest office, sealing the pact with blood and burial." The two exchanged glances and laughed: "Strange indeed! This is not the Dao as we know it.

In the days when Shennong ruled the world, sacrifices were made with utmost reverence yet without prayers for blessing. Toward men, he was loyal and trustworthy, governing thoroughly yet without demand. He delighted in governance as governance, in order as order. He did not build himself up through others’ ruin, nor exalt himself through others’ lowliness, nor profit from the times.

Now Zhou, seeing Yin’s chaos, hastily seizes power. Above, it schemes; below, it bribes. It deploys force to preserve might, slaughters beasts to swear oaths as trust, parades its deeds to please the masses, and wages war for gain—merely replacing one tyranny with another.

We have heard that in ancient times, when the world was well-ordered, the worthy did not shirk their duty; when it was disordered, they did not cling to mere survival. Today, the world is benighted, Zhou’s virtue wanes. To align with Zhou would sully our persons—better to withdraw and keep our conduct pure."

The two journeyed north to Mount Shouyang and starved to death. As for Boyi and Shuqi, when it came to wealth and rank, if they could have obtained them without compromise, they would not have refused. Their lofty integrity and unyielding conduct were their joy alone; they served no worldly cause—such was the resolve of these two scholars.

Shu Dan—*Shu* being a term for younger brother. "Double your rank" meant doubling their emolument. "Appoint you to the highest office" referred to the pinnacle of officialdom. The oath was sealed by slaying an animal, drawing its blood, and burying the remains.

Invoking Shennong was to contrast with the ancient age, which was not like this. "Sacrifices in season" meant timely rites. "Without prayers for blessing" meant sacrificing without seeking favor. "Governing thoroughly yet without demand" meant no desire for renown. "Delighting in governance as governance, in order as order" implied action without self-interest.

"Hastily seizes power" described Zhou’s eagerness to enact good governance. "Below, it bribes" referred to using ranks and emoluments to lure the world’s scholars. "Deploys force" meant resorting to perilous measures. "Preserves might" meant establishing martial authority. "Parades its deeds" meant broadcasting its reputation. "Replacing one tyranny with another" meant Zhou’s deeds were no better than Zhou Xin’s.

"To align with Zhou" meant joining Zhou in this age—defiling themselves, as if clad in court robes and cap while seated in filth and ashes. "Would not have refused" meant not taking such things as their due.

Later, the mountain inscription read: "In youth, one relies on emoluments"—hence the use of *rely*. "Unyielding" meant conduct so rigid it verged on defiance. To "carve intent" was to act with such extremity—this was "unyielding conduct." Boyi and Shuqi did not seek lofty integrity or unyielding conduct; had there been even a hint of justifiable acceptance in wealth and rank, they would have accepted. Only when no such justification existed did they act thus.

"The world is benighted" referred to Shang’s chaos. "Zhou’s virtue wanes" meant Zhou, though rising, acted as it did—its use of cunning to seize the world was called "waning virtue."

This passage does not fully resemble Zhuangzi’s style, though its metaphors—like casting a pearl to strike a sparrow, or prizing one’s arms over the world, or the parables of the butcher and the sheep—are still fine. Yet it falls short of his other works. As for *Robber Zhi*, *Discoursing on Swords*, and *The Old Fisherman*, they are even more so.

**Miscellaneous Chapters: Robber Zhi**

Confucius was a friend of Liuxia Ji, whose younger brother was named Robber Zhi. Robber Zhi commanded nine thousand followers, rampaging across the world and oppressing the feudal lords. He broke into chambers and forced open doors, driving off people’s oxen and horses, and seizing their wives and daughters. Greedy and forgetful of kinship, he paid no heed to parents or brothers and did not offer sacrifices to his ancestors. Wherever he passed, great states fortified their cities, small states took refuge in their strongholds, and the common people suffered greatly.

Confucius said to Liuxia Ji: "As a father, one must instruct one’s son; as an elder brother, one must teach one’s younger brother. If a father cannot instruct his son, or an elder brother cannot teach his younger brother, then the bond of father and son, elder and younger brother, is of no worth. Now, sir, you are a man of talent in this generation, yet your younger brother is Robber Zhi, a scourge upon the world, and you cannot teach him. I am secretly ashamed for you. Allow me to go and reason with him."

Liuxia Ji replied: "You say that as a father one must instruct one’s son, and as an elder brother one must teach one’s younger brother. But if a son does not heed his father’s instruction, or a younger brother does not accept his elder brother’s teaching, what can even your eloquence do? Moreover, Zhi’s nature is such that his mind surges like a spring, his intentions gust like the wind. He is strong enough to resist enemies, and his eloquence suffices to gloss over wrongs. He is pleased when his heart is followed, enraged when it is opposed, and easily provoked by words. You must not go."

Confucius did not listen. With Yan Hui driving his carriage and Zigong as his attendant, he went to see Robber Zhi. Robber Zhi was then resting his troops on the southern slopes of Mount Tai, mincing human livers to eat. Confucius alighted from his carriage and approached the messenger, saying: "I, Kong Qiu of Lu, have heard of the general’s lofty virtue and respectfully bow twice to the messenger."

The messenger entered and announced Confucius to Robber Zhi, who flew into a rage. His eyes blazed like stars, his hair bristled to lift his cap, and he said: "Is this not that crafty and deceitful Kong Qiu of Lu? Tell him this: You fabricate words and concoct phrases, falsely invoking Wen and Wu. You wear a cap of twigs and gird yourself with the flanks of dead oxen. You spout a torrent of specious arguments, eating without plowing, clothing yourself without weaving. You flap your lips and wag your tongue, stirring up right and wrong to delude the rulers of the world, causing scholars everywhere to abandon their roots and falsely perform filial piety and brotherly love in hopes of attaining enfeoffment and wealth. Your crimes are grave and heavy. Flee at once, or I shall add your liver to my midday meal."

Confucius sent word again: "I am fortunate to be acquainted with Ji and wish to gaze upon the hem of your robe." The messenger relayed this, and Robber Zhi said: "Let him come forward." Confucius hastened forward, stepped back from his mat, and bowed twice to Robber Zhi.

Robber Zhi was enraged. He stretched out his legs, grasped his sword, glared with bulging eyes, and roared like a nursing tiger: "Come forward, Qiu. If your words please me, you shall live; if they oppose me, you shall die."

Confucius said: "I have heard that there are three virtues under heaven. To be born and grow tall, surpassingly handsome, so that young and old, noble and base all delight in seeing you—this is the highest virtue. To comprehend the bounds of heaven and earth and distinguish all things—this is the middle virtue. To be brave, resolute, and daring, gathering multitudes and leading troops—this is the lowest virtue. Whoever possesses even one of these virtues is fit to face south and call himself a lord. Now, general, you combine all three: your body stands eight feet and two inches tall, your face and eyes radiant, your lips bright as cinnabar, your teeth even as clamshells, your voice attuned to the Yellow Bell. Yet you are called Robber Zhi. I am secretly ashamed for you that you do not claim a nobler name. If you are willing to heed me, I shall go south to Wu and Yue, north to Qi and Lu, east to Song and Wei, and west to Jin and Chu. I shall have a great city of several hundred *li* built for you, establish a settlement of several hundred thousand households, and honor you as a feudal lord. Together with the world, you may begin anew, disband your troops, rest your soldiers, care for your brothers, and jointly sacrifice to your ancestors. This is the conduct of a sage and a man of talent, and the wish of all under heaven."

Robber Zhi flew into a rage and said: "Come forward, Qiu. Those who can be guided by profit or admonished by words are but the foolish and vulgar common folk. As for being tall and handsome, delighting all who see you—this is the legacy of my parents. Even if you do not praise me, do I not know it myself? Moreover, I have heard that those who flatter others to their faces also slander them behind their backs. Now you tell me of great cities and multitudes of people, seeking to guide me with profit and treat me as a herded beast. How can this last long? The greatest of cities is none other than the world itself. Yao and Shun possessed the world, yet their descendants had not even a place to plant an awl. Tang and Wu became Sons of Heaven, yet their posterity perished. Was this not because their profit was too great?

Furthermore, I have heard that in ancient times, beasts were many and people few. Thus, people dwelled in nests to avoid them, gathering acorns by day and roosting in trees by night. Hence, they were called the People of the Nest-Builder. In ancient times, people did not know clothing. In summer, they amassed firewood; in winter, they warmed themselves by it. Hence, they were called the People Who Knew Life. In the age of Shennong, they lay at ease and rose without care. People knew their mothers but not their fathers and lived among elk and deer. They plowed to eat and wove to clothe themselves, harboring no thought of harming one another. This was the height of perfect virtue. Yet the Yellow Emperor could not sustain this virtue. He fought Chiyou on the plains of Zhuolu, and blood flowed for a hundred *li*. Yao and Shun arose and established hosts of ministers. Tang exiled his lord, and King Wu killed Zhou. Ever since, the strong have oppressed the weak, and the many have bullied the few. From Tang and Wu onward, all have been men of disorder.

Now you cultivate the Way of Wen and Wu, grasp the world’s eloquence to instruct later generations, wear embroidered robes and sashes, utter false and deceptive words to delude the rulers of the world, and seek wealth and honor."

No thief is greater than you, yet why does the world not call you "Robber Qiu" and instead call me "Robber Zhi"? You beguiled Zilu with honeyed words to make him follow you, causing him to remove his warrior’s cap, lay aside his long sword, and receive your teachings. The world all says that Confucius can halt violence and forbid wrongdoing. Yet in the end, Zilu sought to kill the lord of Wei, failed in the attempt, and was impaled at the eastern gate of Wei—this was the result of your incomplete instruction.

Do you truly consider yourself a man of talent and a sage? You were twice driven from Lu, your traces erased in Wei, impoverished in Qi, besieged between Chen and Cai, and found no refuge anywhere under heaven. You taught Zilu to bring about this disaster—above, he had no way to preserve himself; below, he had no way to serve others. Is your Way truly worthy of esteem?

Of those the world exalts, none surpasses the Yellow Emperor, yet even he could not preserve his virtue and fought on the plains of Zhuolu, where blood flowed for a hundred *li*. Yao was not compassionate, Shun was not filial, Yu exhausted himself, Tang exiled his lord, King Wu attacked Zhou, and King Wen was imprisoned at Youli. These six men, whom the world reveres—when closely examined, all were deluded by profit and forced their true natures into false paths. Their conduct is truly shameful.

As for the world’s so-called worthy men, Boyi and Shuqi: they renounced the lord of Gubu and starved to death on Mount Shouyang, their flesh and bones left unburied. Bao Jiao adorned his conduct to condemn the age and died embracing a tree. Shentu Di remonstrated but was not heeded; he carried a stone and drowned himself in the river, where fish and turtles fed on him. Jie Zitui was utterly loyal, cutting flesh from his thigh to feed Duke Wen, yet later the duke betrayed him. Enraged, Zitui departed and burned to death in a tree. Weisheng made a tryst with a woman beneath a bridge; when she did not come and the waters rose, he refused to leave and drowned clutching the pillar. These four men differ not from dismembered dogs or drifting swine, or beggars clutching gourd ladles—they all pursued fame and scorned death, heedless of preserving their lives and nurturing their longevity.

As for the world’s so-called loyal ministers, none surpass Prince Bigan and Wu Zixu. Zixu was drowned in the river, Bigan had his heart carved out—these two, whom the world calls loyal ministers, yet in the end became objects of ridicule. From the highest perspective, even Zixu and Bigan are not worthy of esteem.

As for what you, Qiu, have tried to persuade me with: if you spoke to me of ghostly matters, I would not understand them; if you spoke of human affairs, it would be no more than this—all things I have already heard. Now let me tell you of human nature: the eyes desire to see beauty, the ears to hear sound, the mouth to savor taste, and the will to be fulfilled. The longest-lived reach a hundred years, the average eighty, the shortest sixty. Subtracting illness, emaciation, mourning, death, and sorrow, the days one opens one’s mouth to laugh in a month number no more than four or five. Heaven and earth are without end, yet human death comes at its appointed time. Clutching this finite vessel and entrusting it to the boundless, it vanishes in an instant, no different from a swift steed galloping past a crack in the wall. Those who cannot delight their will and nurture their lives are not masters of the Way.

All that you, Qiu, have said are things I reject. Hurry, leave, and return home—speak no more of it. Your Way is frantic and deceitful, a craft of falsehood and pretense, incapable of preserving the true. What is there to discuss?

Confucius bowed twice, hastened away, exited the gate, and mounted his carriage. Three times he fumbled the reins, his eyes blank and sightless, his complexion ashen, his head bowed against the crossbar, unable to catch his breath. Returning to the eastern gate of Lu, he encountered Liuxia Ji. Liuxia Ji said, "You have been absent for days. Your carriage and horses bear the marks of travel—did you by chance go to see Zhi?"

Confucius looked up to the heavens and sighed, "Yes."

Liuxia Ji said, "Did Zhi perhaps offend you as before?"

Confucius replied, "Yes."

Qiu, what you speak of is like needlessly cauterizing oneself when free of illness. You rush to measure the tiger’s head and braid its whiskers—how nearly did you escape its jaws? To "enter the fortress" means to shut the gates and guard oneself. "The heart like a gushing spring" describes qi in its full vigor. "The intent like a whirling wind" conveys the sense of hollow arrogance and frivolous pride. "Falsely invoking Wen and Wu" means to claim falsely the Way of Kings Wen and Wu as one’s own. "Branch-wood" refers to stripping bark from tree branches to fashion a cap. "Ox-flank" is oxhide. "Found favor with Ji" means to have grown close to Liuxia Ji. "Gazing at his sandals in deference" describes how, upon a single audience with Liuxia Ji, one would long for even the sight of his footwear—this is the language of repeated pleas for an audience. "Knowledge encompasses heaven and earth" means that one’s knowledge can embrace heaven and earth, leaving nothing beyond its scope. "Able to distinguish all things" means that one’s talent can discern the names of all things—implying omniscience. "In the end" refers to the final outcome. "Yu’s partial paralysis" alludes to his calloused hands and feet. "Who would debate it in detail?" means to examine it thoroughly. "Dismembering dogs and butchering swine" describes how one’s own death resembles the slaughter of dogs and pigs. "Holding a gourd to beg" signifies seeking from others. "Detached" means clinging—being mired in fame, hence "detached from fame." "Not contemplating the root" means failing to recognize one’s original, true nature. "Frantic" is synonymous with restless. "Three times he fumbled the reins" means the reins repeatedly slipped from his grasp. "His carriage and horses bore the marks of travel" suggests the appearance of one who had set out and was only now returning. "By chance" means "perhaps"—"Did you by chance go to see Zhi?" "As before" refers to what had been said previously. "As I said before..."

Zizhang asked Mang Goude, "Why not cultivate conduct?" Mang Goude replied, "Without conduct, there is no trust; without trust, no appointment; without appointment, no profit. Thus, when one observes fame and calculates advantage, righteousness is indeed the truth. If one abandons fame and profit and turns inward to the heart, then the scholar’s conduct cannot be neglected for a single day." Mang Goude said, "The shameless grow rich, and the deceitful gain prominence. The greatest fame and profit lie in shamelessness and deceit. Thus, when one observes fame and calculates advantage, trust is indeed the truth. If one abandons fame and profit and turns inward to the heart, then the scholar’s conduct embraces the heavens." Zizhang said, "In ancient times, Jie and Zhou were exalted as Sons of Heaven, possessing all under heaven. Yet if one were to tell Zang Ju, ‘Your conduct resembles Jie and Zhou,’ he would flush with shame. Such disdain marks the baseness of petty men. Confucius and Mo Di lived in poverty as commoners, yet if one were to tell a prime minister, ‘Your conduct resembles Confucius and Mo Di,’ his expression would change, and his color shift. Such praise is deemed insufficient—for the scholar, true nobility lies therein. Thus, to hold the power of the Son of Heaven does not necessarily confer nobility, nor does poverty as a commoner necessarily mean baseness. The distinction between noble and base rests in the goodness or evil of one’s conduct." Mang Goude said, "Petty thieves are imprisoned, while great thieves become lords. At the gates of lords, righteous scholars reside. In former times, Duke Huan of Qi, Xiaobai, killed his brother and took his sister-in-law, yet Guan Zhong served as his minister. Tian Chengzi murdered his lord and usurped the state, yet Confucius accepted his gifts."

To condemn in speech yet defer in conduct—this is the contradiction of words and deeds warring within the breast. Is this not perverse?

Thus the Book says: "Who is vile? Who is noble? The successful become the head, the failed the tail." Zizhang said, "If you do not act, kinship and affection will lack order, noble and base will lack righteousness, elder and younger will lack sequence—how then shall the Five Constants and Six Positions be distinguished?" Mang Goude replied: "Yao killed his eldest son, Shun exiled his younger brother—where is the order in kinship? Tang punished Jie, King Wu slew Zhou—where is the righteousness in noble and base? King Ji was the rightful heir, yet the Duke of Zhou killed his elder brother—where is the sequence in elder and younger? The Confucians preach hypocritical words, the Mohists advocate universal love—how can the Five Constants and Six Positions be distinguished? Moreover, you rectify for the sake of reputation, I rectify for the sake of profit. The substance of reputation and profit does not accord with principle, nor does it reflect the Dao. Daily I dispute with you before Wu Yue, saying: 'The petty man dies for wealth, the gentleman dies for reputation.' Though their motives for altering their nature differ, when they abandon what they should do to die for what they should not, they are the same. Thus it is said: 'Do not be a petty man, and in turning back, follow Heaven. Do not be a gentleman, and follow Heaven’s principle.' Whether crooked or straight, they form the ultimate pattern of Heaven. Observe the four directions, and move with the seasons. Whether right or wrong, grasp the round mechanism. Alone in your intent, wander with the Dao. Do not turn against the Way in action, do not seek success in righteousness—you will lose what you strive for. Do not rush toward wealth, do not die for success—you will abandon your Heaven. Bi Gan was disemboweled, Wu Zixu had his eyes gouged out—such are the calamities of loyalty. Zhigong testified against his father, Weisheng drowned—such are the disasters of trustworthiness. Master Bao stood rigid, Shen Buhai did not defend himself—such are the harms of integrity. Confucius did not see his mother, Kuangzi did not see his father—such are the failures of righteousness. These are the tales handed down from high antiquity, the lessons repeated in later ages to instruct scholars: rectify your words and align your conduct, yet they still suffer misfortune and encounter disaster.

Why not act? Why not cultivate virtue and conduct? To observe reputation and calculate profit, only righteousness is truly right. If a man abandons reputation and profit, he reverses his heart’s desires and finds no joy—he must seek them, and only through righteous conduct can he do so. This is the intent of those who study to obtain office. The trustworthy become eminent—this means using trustworthy words to seek glory. Such words feign trustworthiness for self-interest. Zizhang speaks of seeking profit through righteousness, while Mang Goude says that those who seek reputation and profit today do so through deceit alone.

If one claims to abandon reputation and profit yet reverses his heart’s desires, insisting on obtaining them, then following the heart’s desires in a self-satisfied, opportunistic scheme is still to embrace one’s natural Heaven, free from artifice. Thus it is said: "Hold fast to your Heaven." Petty thieves are imprisoned, great thieves become lords—this is the argument from the *Opening the Trunk* chapter. The contradiction of words and deeds warring within the breast means that actions disregard words, and words disregard actions. "The successful become the head, the failed the tail"—this is what was previously called "those who seize the moment are righteous followers, those who miss it are usurpers." The underlying meaning is that acts of benevolence and righteousness are all deceitful and artificial, not natural Heaven.

The Five Constants are the five virtues; the Six Positions are the Three Bonds—ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife. "You rectify for the sake of reputation" means you seek to obtain through the name of benevolence and righteousness, while I seek only profit, without feigning such names. Both reputation and profit are not true principles, thus it is said: "The substance of reputation and profit does not accord with principle, nor does it reflect the Dao." Wu Yue means unrestrained, following nature. Mang Goude and Wu Yue are names with implied meanings, like "Knowing Non-Action" in the previous chapter.

"Abandoning what one should do" means forsaking what one ought to do, failing to preserve life and protect one’s nature. "Dying for what one should not do" refers to pursuing profit and reputation, which are not what one should do. Following Heaven’s natural principle eliminates the distinction between gentleman and petty man, thus it is said: "Do not be a petty man, and in turning back, follow Heaven. Do not be a gentleman, and follow Heaven’s principle." This means neither being a gentleman nor a petty man, so one can follow the natural principle of Heaven.

Whether crooked or straight, when viewed in relation to one another, they are all the ultimate principle of Heaven. Thus it is said: "Whether crooked or straight, they form the ultimate pattern of Heaven." The four directions each have their place, and the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter belong to them—ebb and flow are all of a single qi. Thus it is said: "Observe the four directions, and move with the seasons." Grasping the round mechanism eliminates right and wrong, thus it is said: "Whether right or wrong, grasp the round mechanism." Acting on true intent alone, one attains the Dao, thus it is said: "Alone in your intent, wander with the Dao."

"Turning" means going against. Acting against the Dao, self-righteously seeking success, one loses what is truly natural. Thus it is said: "Do not turn against the Way in action, do not seek success in righteousness—you will lose what you strive for." Rushing toward wealth and dying for success will cause one to lose one’s natural Heaven. Thus it is said: "Do not rush toward wealth, do not die for success—you will abandon your Heaven." "Do not" means "do not act thus," an expression of prohibition.

"Rectifying one’s words" means taking loyal, trustworthy, virtuous, and righteous words as true. "Aligning one’s conduct" means acting with loyalty, trustworthiness, virtue, and righteousness. "Suffer" means to endure; "encounter" means to adhere. Thus one inevitably meets with misfortune and disaster. Why not act? Why not cultivate virtue and conduct? Observing reputation and calculating profit, only righteousness is truly right. If a man abandons reputation and profit, he reverses his heart’s desires and finds no joy—he must seek them, and only through righteous conduct can he do so. This is the intent of those who study to obtain office. The trustworthy become eminent—this means using trustworthy words to seek glory. Such words feign trustworthiness for self-interest. Zizhang speaks of seeking profit through righteousness, while Mang Goude says that those who seek reputation and profit today do so through deceit alone.

Zizhang sought to practice righteousness to attain wealth and recognition, borrowing the language of seeking office to lend it a name. Those who are content with mere acquisition treat such opportunism as the natural Way, thus framing their arguments in question-and-answer form. Their intent is to claim that feigning virtue to gain advantage is inferior to following one’s true nature. This distorts Mencius’ distinction between the Heavenly office and the human office.

Wu Zu asked Zhi He: “No man is without the impulse to pursue fame and profit. The wealthy attract followers; followers submit to them; submission leads to reverence. To be revered and submitted to—this is the Way to long life, bodily ease, and joy of mind. Yet you alone show no interest. Is your wisdom insufficient? Or do you understand but lack the strength to act? Why do you persist in upholding principle without letting go?”

Zhi He replied: “These men you speak of—born in the same era, dwelling in the same land—believe themselves to be transcendent sages beyond the common world. Yet they lack any guiding principle, drifting with the times to judge right and wrong. They conform to worldly customs, abandoning what is most weighty and most noble, all for the sake of their pursuits. How can such conduct be the Way to long life, bodily ease, and joy of mind? Grief and sorrow, contentment and joy—these are not reflected in their bodies. Fear and dread, delight and apprehension—these are not mirrored in their hearts. They know how to act but not *why* they act. Thus, though they may be honored as Son of Heaven and possess all under Heaven, they cannot escape suffering.

‘Persisting in upholding principle without letting go’ means: Do you truly lack the wisdom to desire wealth and honor? Or do you *know* this path but lack the power to follow it? Thus, I press the right principle to curb the craving for wealth and status, yet you cannot forget it. These men—these wealthy and honored men—live in the same world and the same land as I do. They are not sages who transcend the age; they are no higher than anyone else. My point is that they are ordinary men, and I am no less aware of this than you. Their hearts have no fixed anchor, no grasp of the true nature of life and destiny. They merely chase the trends of the moment to secure their own advantage, swept along by the tide of custom. Their judgments of right and wrong are self-serving, weighing past and present to seek personal gain. What is most weighty and most noble—the natural principle of Heaven—they cast aside, all for the sake of their pursuit of wealth and status. How can this be the Way to long life, bodily ease, and peace of mind?

Those who seek wealth and status may experience bodily comfort or distress, joy or sorrow, yet they remain blind to it all, unable to perceive themselves. Thus it is said: ‘not reflected in their bodies, not reflected in their hearts.’ They know *how* to act—through human effort—but not *why* they act—the principle of Heaven. Even the Son of Heaven, knowing only human effort and not Heaven’s principle, cannot escape harm to his person. How much less can those beneath him?

Wu Zu said: “Wealth brings every advantage to man. It exhausts beauty and exhausts power, reaching what even the most accomplished cannot attain, surpassing what the worthiest cannot match. It harnesses others’ strength to amplify its might, wields others’ wisdom to sharpen its discernment, and appropriates others’ virtue to adorn its goodness. Though not a ruler, it commands awe like a sovereign. Moreover, the allure of sensual pleasures, fine flavors, and power over men’s hearts is innate—no learning is needed to delight in them, no model is required to find them agreeable. Desires and aversions, attraction and avoidance—these are not taught; they are man’s nature. Though all the world may oppose me, who can renounce them?”

Zhi He replied: “The actions of the wise are always for the sake of the people, never transgressing the proper measure. Thus, they have enough and do not contend; having no ulterior motive, they do not seek. Those who lack, seek; they vie for every opportunity yet do not consider themselves greedy. Those who have enough, decline; they renounce all under Heaven yet do not consider themselves noble. True nobility or greed is not imposed from without—it is a reflection of one’s own measure.

Though possessing the power of the Son of Heaven, they do not use their rank to domineer over others. Though owning all under Heaven, they do not flaunt their wealth to toy with men. They weigh the consequences, consider the repercussions, and recognize the harm to their nature. Thus, they decline and do not accept—not to seek fame. Yao and Shun ruled as emperors yet remained at ease, not out of benevolence toward the world, but to avoid allowing beauty to harm their lives. Shan Juan and Xu You declined the throne, not out of empty modesty, but to avoid allowing affairs to harm themselves. All of them pursued what benefited them and declined what harmed them. Though the world calls them worthy, they did not act to cultivate reputation.

Here, Wu Zu speaks not of honor but only of wealth. ‘Exhausting beauty’ means indulging every desire; ‘exhausting power’ means exercising every prerogative. Even the most accomplished and worthy cannot match this—it speaks to the sheer force at one’s disposal. ‘Harnessing others’ and ‘wielding others’ both describe how wealth can command men, embodying the idea of ‘moving even the gods.’ Desire for wealth and aversion to poverty, fleeing poverty and pursuing wealth—these require no instruction, for they are not learned from a teacher. They arise from the spontaneity of human nature. Though all the world may condemn it, how can I renounce it?” This is the argument of the greedy.

Wu Zu—whose name means ‘Never Enough’—and those like ‘Content with Mere Acquisition’ are insatiable. The actions of the wise are always guided by what the people share from Heaven, never daring to transgress the proper measure.

The people’s shared endowment from Heaven consists of tangible things and their inherent principles—measure is principle. To be content and not contend means one’s virtue suffices for oneself, leaving nothing to dispute. To act without purpose is not to seek action; this lies not in man but in Heaven, for human effort plays no part—hence “to act without purpose.” Recognizing that human effort plays no part, one ceases to seek. If what lies within oneself is insufficient, one may exhaust the four quarters in pursuit without being deemed greedy—this is the pursuit of virtue, the search for what lies within. When virtue suffices and overflows, one renounces all external things; even if one were to renounce the world, it would not be for comfort.

These two—seeking sustenance and comfort—are not pursued for others, nor do they involve external striving; rather, they both return to the principles and measures of Heaven’s pattern and reflect upon them—hence “returning to reflect upon the measure.” To dazzle others with wealth is to stir the world. To consider the reverse is to turn inward and reflect. *Yong* means the people at peace in times of change. Not allowing beauty to harm life means acting without contrivance, not letting a fine reputation harm oneself, and possessing the world without clinging to it. One *can* possess it, for the worthy name of the world can be rightfully claimed without shame. Such conduct in the Dao and virtue arises from the sincerity of the heart, not from seeking to establish fame.

Here again, Yao, Shun, and Xu You are all treated as fond of persuasion. Wu Zu says: “One who clings to reputation, hardens the body, rejects sweetness, and restricts nourishment to preserve life is like one long afflicted by chronic illness yet does not die.” Zhi He says: “Balance brings fortune; excess brings harm—nothing is otherwise, and wealth is the most extreme case. Now the rich man’s ears are filled with the sounds of bells, drums, pipes, and flutes; his mouth savors the flavors of fine meats and wines, stirring his mind and causing him to neglect his affairs—this may be called disorder. Overwhelmed by pent-up *qi*, he labors like one bearing a heavy load uphill—this may be called suffering. Coveting wealth, he exhausts himself; grasping for power, he depletes himself. In quietude, he drowns; in abundance, he swells—this may be called sickness. Driven by the desire for wealth and profit, he rushes forward like one with ears blocked, unable to avoid danger, pressing on relentlessly—this may be called disgrace. Wealth accumulates yet goes unused; he clings to it without release, his heart filled with sorrow and distress, ever seeking more without cease—this may be called anxiety. Within, he fears the threats of extortion and robbery; without, he dreads bandits and thieves. His inner chambers are fortified, and he dares not walk alone—this may be called fear. These six are the greatest harms in the world, yet they are forgotten and left unexamined. When calamity strikes, one seeks to exhaust one’s nature and deplete one’s wealth to return to a single day of carefree ease—but it cannot be obtained.

Thus, when one gazes upon reputation, it is not seen; when one seeks profit, it is not gained. Yet one strains the mind and exhausts the body in contention for these—is this not delusion? ‘Clinging to reputation’ means insisting on seeking fame while forsaking the benefits of wealth and honor, thereby needlessly tormenting oneself—though alive, one is like one gravely ill. ‘Rejecting sweetness’ means forgoing fine flavors. ‘Restricting nourishment’ means frugality in self-care. ‘Long afflicted by chronic illness yet does not die’ echoes the *Yijing*’s ‘steadfast in illness, ever undying.’ Balance brings fortune; excess brings harm—nothing is otherwise, and wealth is the most extreme case.

Though this passage’s branches and leaves are somewhat coarse, falling short of the *Rang Wang* and *Yu Fu*, even a single line here is well-phrased—how could it be erased? *Qian* means to stuff the mouth full. The monkey’s cheek is called *qian*. ‘Stirring his mind’ means agitating his thoughts, implying enslavement of the heart. ‘Neglecting his affairs’ means forsaking what he ought to do. *Feng qi* means angering the *qi* so that it cannot flow. *Hai* means drowning, being ill at ease, like one carrying a heavy load uphill. ‘Seeking sufficiency’ means seeking fulfillment. ‘Seeking depletion’ means exhausting all. As the common saying goes, ‘Do not use all your power.’ ‘In quietude, he drowns’ means being unable to endure idleness and sinking into desires. ‘In abundance, he swells’ means that when the body is plump and sleek, it becomes full and arrogant. ‘High as a wall’ means wealth piled high like a wall—what is called ‘that thing by the bed.’ ‘Unable to avoid’ means insatiable, ever pursuing without cease. *Feng* means reliance. Relying on this for boasting, he cannot let go. ‘Clinging without release’ means constant remembrance, never forgotten. ‘Constant remembrance’ means only seeing sorrow and distress filling the heart—hence ‘the heart filled with sorrow and distress.’ So afflicted, he still seeks more without cease. *Cha qing* means extortion and robbery.”

Those who hoard within their houses, fearing robbers, construct lofts and lattice windows all around their chambers. When transporting goods abroad, fearing great bandits, they must assemble a retinue of followers and dare not travel alone. *Shu* means windows; *lou* refers to the upper stories of walls.

These six are called chaos, suffering, illness, disgrace, sorrow, and fear. "Neglected and unexamined" means losing all self-restraint without awareness. *Dan* means alone. *Dan* also signifies "merely," as in "mere affairs." *Fan* means to return. Once illness and misfortune have taken form, though one may seek to preserve life and relinquish wealth, merely longing for a single day’s return to the carefree poverty of former times is no longer possible.

"Exhausting one’s nature" means fully preserving life. *Jie* means to remove. "Reversed desire" means abandoning wealth to embrace poverty. By the time one reaches this point, where then is fame? Where then is profit? "Entangled thoughts and severed body" describes the binding of one’s body and mind. In the pursuit of profit, one merely ensnares body and mind, only to bring about such calamity—is this not folly?

Su Dongpo observed that the four chapters following *Rang Wang* were not the work of Zhuangzi, a judgment of great insight. Among these four, *Dao Zhi* is the most extreme, yet Sima Qian’s *Biography of Zhuangzi* merely states that he composed *Yu Fu*, *Dao Zhi*, and *Qu Qie* to slander and ridicule Confucius’s disciples, without the slightest doubt regarding the differences in refinement or consistency of the texts. Why is this? What was Zichang’s intent?

Moreover, did he speak of criticizing the Master merely to overlook the quality of the text? If not, then this book and this chapter, having survived into the Han dynasty and beyond, may have suffered from scattered fragments later interpolated by others—much like the *Liezi* of today.

**Miscellaneous Chapters: "Discourse on Swords"**
Formerly, King Wen of Zhao delighted in swords. Swordsmen thronged his gates as retainers, numbering over three thousand. Day and night, they clashed before him, with over a hundred dying or wounded each year. His obsession knew no end, and after three years of this, the state declined, and the feudal lords plotted against him. The crown prince, Kui, grew anxious and offered a reward to his attendants: "Whoever can persuade the king to abandon his fondness for swordsmen shall receive six thousand gold pieces." His attendants replied, "Zhuangzi would be capable of this."

The crown prince then sent envoys bearing a thousand gold pieces to present to Zhuangzi, but Zhuangzi declined and accompanied the messengers back. Meeting the crown prince, he said, "What instruction does the prince have for Zhou, that he offers Zhou a thousand gold pieces?" The crown prince replied, "I have heard that you, Master, are enlightened and sagely. I humbly present this thousand gold as a gift for your attendants. If you refuse, how dare I speak further?"

Zhuangzi said, "I have heard that the prince wishes to employ Zhou to end the king’s obsession. If I were to persuade the king but contradict his will, or fail to please the prince, I would face execution. How then could I accept the gold? But if I persuade the king and satisfy the prince, what in Zhao could I not obtain?"

The crown prince said, "Indeed. What my king sees are only swordsmen."

Zhuangzi replied, "Very well. Zhou is skilled in the sword."

The crown prince said, "Yet the swordsmen my king favors all have unkempt hair, bristling sideburns, drooping caps, tassels of coarse silk, short-backed robes, glaring eyes, and speak in harsh tones. The king delights in them. If you, Master, appear before him in Confucian garb, the matter will surely go awry."

Zhuangzi said, "Permit me to prepare sword attire." After three days of preparing his sword attire, he appeared before the crown prince, who then presented him to the king. The king, gripping his unsheathed blade, awaited him.

Zhuangzi entered the palace gates without haste and did not bow upon seeing the king. The king said, "What would you teach me, that the crown prince has gone before you?"

Zhuangzi replied, "I have heard that Your Majesty delights in swords, so I have come to present my swordsmanship."

The king asked, "What can your sword do to restrain or control?"

Zhuangzi said, "My sword can strike down one man every ten paces and traverse a thousand *li* without hindrance."

The king, greatly pleased, exclaimed, "You would be invincible in the world!"

Zhuangzi said, "For the swordsman, one displays emptiness, entices with advantage, strikes after the opponent moves, and arrives before the opponent. I wish to demonstrate this."

The king said, "Rest now, Master."

He was lodged in the guest quarters to await the king’s command. The king then ordered a sword exhibition to be arranged and invited the Master. Over seven days, the king assembled swordsmen, of whom over sixty were killed or wounded, leaving only five or six. These were made to present their swords at the palace steps, and then Zhuangzi was summoned.

The king said, “Today, let us have the warriors test their swords in contest.”

Zhuangzi replied, “I have long awaited this.”

The king asked, “What length of weapon does the Master wield?”

Zhuangzi said, “Any length I am given will suffice. Yet I possess three swords, and whichever the king chooses to employ, I shall first describe and then demonstrate.”

The king said, “I would hear of the three swords.”

Zhuangzi said, “There is the Sword of the Son of Heaven, the Sword of the Feudal Lords, and the Sword of the Common Folk.”

The king asked, “What is the Sword of the Son of Heaven like?”

Zhuangzi said, “The Sword of the Son of Heaven has its blade forged from Yanxi and Shicheng, its edge from Mount Tai of Qi, its spine from Jin and Wei, its guard from Zhou and Song, and its hilt from Han and Wei. It is bound by the Four Barbarians, wrapped in the Four Seasons, encircled by the Bohai Sea, and girded by Mount Chang. Its governance follows the Five Phases, its judgments balance punishment and virtue, its opening aligns with yin and yang, its grasp is held in spring and summer, and its execution proceeds in autumn and winter. This sword, when thrust, knows no forward obstacle; when raised, knows no height above; when pressed, knows no depth below; when swung, knows no side beside. Above, it cleaves the floating clouds; below, it severs the earth’s foundations. When this sword is once employed, it rectifies the feudal lords, and all under heaven submits. Such is the Sword of the Son of Heaven.”

King Wen, dazed and self-abashed, asked, “And what of the Sword of the Feudal Lords?”

Zhuangzi said, “The Sword of the Feudal Lords has its blade in the wisdom and courage of knights, its edge in the purity and integrity of scholars, its spine in the worthiness and goodness of gentlemen, its guard in the loyalty and sagacity of ministers, and its hilt in the heroism and valor of warriors. This sword, when thrust, likewise knows no forward obstacle; when raised, no height above; when pressed, no depth below; when swung, no side beside. Above, it models the round heavens, following the Three Luminaries; below, it models the square earth, aligning with the Four Seasons; within, it discerns the people’s will, bringing peace to the four quarters. When this sword is once employed, it strikes like the thunder’s shock, and within the four borders, none fail to submit and heed their lord’s command. Such is the Sword of the Feudal Lords.”

The king asked, “And what of the Sword of the Common Folk?”

Zhuangzi said, “The Sword of the Common Folk is wielded by those with disheveled hair and unkempt topknots, their caps askew, their tassels coarse and rough, their robes short and trailing. They glare fiercely and speak in challenge. They clash before one another, striking above at necks and throats, below at livers and lungs. This sword of the common folk differs not from cockfighting—one life is lost in a day, and it serves no purpose in the affairs of state. Now, though Your Majesty holds the position of the Son of Heaven, you delight in the sword of the common folk. I humbly deem this unworthy of Your Majesty.”

Thereupon, the king led Zhuangzi up to the hall. The royal steward presented the feast, and the king circled the table thrice. Zhuangzi said, “May Your Majesty sit composed and settle your qi. The matter of the sword has now been presented in full.”

From that day, King Wen did not leave the palace for three months, and the swordsmen all prostrated themselves and perished where they stood. Those who delighted in the sword were fond of such swordplay as sport. To "flank the gates" means to crowd the gates. Over three thousand swordsmen, treating their swordsmanship as a profession, were retained as guests at the king’s gates. "With gifts as followers" refers to those who received such offerings as their stipend, akin to what is now called "rewarding followers." "Disheveled hair and unkempt topknots" describes their hair and sideburns left exposed. "Caps askew" means their headgear was not properly raised, like a wrapped kerchief today. "Tassels" are what hang beneath the neck. "Coarse and rough" describes their uncouth manner. "Short and trailing robes" means their garments were not hemmed. "Speaking in challenge" refers to their verbal provocations when seeking combat. "Displaying emptiness and enticing with advantage" means luring the opponent forward with an opening. "Striking after the opponent moves yet arriving first" describes the raptor’s crouch before it strikes. "Arranging the exhibition" means setting up the swordplay display. "Testing swords" refers to the decisive clash of blades. "Wielding the weapon" means to use and grasp it. "Blade" refers to the sword’s tip. "Edge" is the cutting part. "Guard" is the sword’s mouth. "Hilt" is the sword’s handle. "Wrapped in the Four Seasons" signifies its use is timely. "Governed by the Five Phases" means it follows the principles of the Five Phases. The sun represents virtue, the moon punishment; the sun and moon embody yin and yang, and spring, summer, autumn, and winter all accord with the natural order of creation. "Thrusting, raising, pressing, and swinging" all describe the sword’s vast and boundless application. "Dazed and self-abashed" means that upon hearing such grand discourse, the king realized the shallowness of his own preferences and thus felt abashed. "Above modeling heaven, below modeling earth, and within harmonizing the people’s will" corresponds to the harmony of heaven’s timing, earth’s advantage, and human accord. "The four quarters" refers to the four directions. "Led up to the hall" means he was drawn upward. "Circling thrice" means he did not sit but walked three times around the place where the food was set, an expression of his shame. "Prostrated" shares the same meaning as "submitted"; since the king no longer favored such displays, the swordsmen all withdrew and perished in their quarters.

**Miscellaneous Chapters: The Fisherman**

Confucius wandered in the Ziwei Forest and rested, sitting upon the Apricot Platform. His disciples read their books while Confucius strummed his zither and sang, playing a melody not yet halfway through when a fisherman descended from his boat and approached. His temples and brows were mingled with white, his hair unbound, and his sleeves swaying as he walked. Ascending from the marshland, he stopped at the shore, his left hand resting on his knee, his right hand supporting his chin, listening. When the song ended, he beckoned to Zilu and Zigong. Both responded, and the stranger pointed at Confucius, asking, “What is that man doing?”

Zilu replied, “He is a gentleman of Lu.”

The stranger asked about his clan.

Zilu answered, “His clan is Kong.”

“And what does the Kong clan govern?”

Zilu did not respond, but Zigong answered, “The Kong clan cultivates loyalty and trust in nature, embodies benevolence and righteousness in conduct, refines ritual and music, and selects the principles of human relations. Above, they serve the rulers of the age with loyalty; below, they transform the common people, seeking to benefit the world. This is what the Kong clan governs.”

The stranger then asked, “Is he a lord with lands?”

Zigong said, “No.”

“Is he an advisor to kings and princes?”

Zigong said, “No.”

The stranger laughed and turned away, walking off as he spoke: “Benevolent, indeed, he is—but I fear he will not escape harm to himself. His heart labors and his form toils, endangering his true nature. Alas, how far he is from the Dao!”

Zigong returned and reported this to Confucius. Confucius pushed aside his zither and rose, saying, “Is he a sage?” He then descended to seek him, reaching the marsh’s edge. The fisherman was just then poising his pole to draw his boat when he turned and saw Confucius standing with his face toward home. Confucius retreated a few steps, then advanced and bowed twice.

The stranger said, “What do you seek?”

Confucius replied, “Earlier, sir, you left with words unfinished. I, unworthy as I am, did not understand. I have secretly waited here, hoping to hear even the sound of your cough or sigh, that I might receive your instruction to the end.”

The stranger said, “Ah! How earnest is your love of learning!”

Confucius bowed twice and rose, saying, “From my youth I have cultivated learning until now, at sixty-nine years of age. Yet I have never heard the ultimate teaching. How dare I not be humble in heart?”

The stranger said, “Like attracts like, and like sounds resonate—this is the principle of heaven. Let me set aside what I possess and explain to you what you should know. What you should know concerns human affairs. The Son of Heaven, the feudal lords, the great officers, and the common people—these four ranks are the perfection of proper governance. If these four abandon their positions, no greater disorder can arise. When officials govern their duties and people attend to their tasks, none encroach upon another. Thus, fields lie fallow and homes stand exposed, clothing and food are insufficient, taxes and levies are unmet, wives and concubines are discordant, and elders and juniors lack order—these are the worries of the common people. Inability to fulfill one’s role, official duties left undone, conduct that is not pure, subordinates who are negligent, achievements unrecognized, ranks and emoluments unstable—these are the worries of the great officers. The court lacks loyal ministers, the state is benighted and disordered, craftsmen lack skill, tribute is unworthy, seasonal rites are delayed or out of order, and the Son of Heaven is not obeyed—these are the worries of the feudal lords. Yin and yang are not in harmony, cold and heat arrive untimely, harming all things; feudal lords act with violence and disorder, seizing and attacking one another, ravaging the people; ritual and music lack moderation, resources are exhausted, human relations are unrefined, and the hundred clans are licentious—these are the worries of the Son of Heaven’s ministers.

Now, you possess neither the authority of a lord or minister above nor the office of a great officer below, yet you presume to refine ritual and music, select the principles of human relations, and transform the common people. Is this not overreaching?

Moreover, people have eight flaws, and affairs have four perils—these cannot be left unexamined.

To meddle in affairs that are not one’s own is called *zong* (meddlesomeness);
To advance where none heed you is called *ning* (obsequiousness);
To guide speech by anticipating others’ wishes is called *chan* (flattery);
To speak without discerning right or wrong is called *yu* (sycophancy);
To delight in speaking of others’ faults is called *chan* (slander);
To sever friendships and divide kin is called *zei* (treachery);
To praise falsely and deceive, leading others to ruin, is called *te* (depravity);
To fail to distinguish good from bad, accommodating both sides, stealthily seizing what one desires, is called *xian* (perfidy).

These eight flaws externally confuse others and internally harm oneself. The noble person does not befriend such people, nor does the enlightened ruler employ them.

As for the four perils:
To love undertaking great affairs, altering and changing the constant, seeking to hang one’s name upon achievements, is called *tao* (presumptuousness);
To monopolize knowledge, arrogate affairs, encroach upon others, and act on one’s own, is called *tan* (greed);
To see one’s faults yet not change, and to hear admonition yet grow worse, is called *hen* (obduracy);
To approve of what accords with oneself and disapprove of what does not, even if it is good, is called *jin* (arrogance).

These are the four perils. Only when one has cast off the eight flaws and refrains from the four perils can one begin to be taught.

*Ziwei* is the name of the forest. *Yumei* means to swing one’s sleeves. *Selecting human relations* means choosing their principles to teach people. *Walking and speaking* means departing without telling Zigong and Zilu, speaking as he went. *How far he is from the Dao* means he is distant from the Dao. *Na* is a boat pole. *Retreating and walking* means stepping back a few paces before advancing. *Unfinished words* refers to brief remarks that were not exhaustive. *To the end assist so-and-so* means to ultimately teach and aid that person. *Like attracts like, like sounds resonate* means this principle is shared by all people. *Setting aside what I possess* means putting aside the Dao I possess. *Explaining what you should know* means systematically presenting what people ought to know. *Setting aside* means to let go and not speak of it. *Systematically presenting* means to arrange in order. The *four ranks being proper* means each fulfills its duty; the *four ranks abandoning their positions* means they encroach upon one another’s affairs. Each office governs its own duty, and each person attends to their own task. *Worry* means to think. The *Book of Songs* says, “In office, think of its worries.” *None encroach upon another* means none usurp or seize from one another. *Taxes and levies unmet* means they are not continuous.

Not claiming credit for achievements is to have no merit. *Not holding fast* means being unable to maintain and guard. *Spring and Autumn out of order* means the sequence of court audiences is lost. *The Son of Heaven’s officials* refers to the Son of Heaven’s dukes and ministers. *Taking up what is not one’s affair* is called meddling—presuming to handle what is not one’s own business. *Advancing without being heeded* means forcing one’s words forward without being asked, flaunting one’s eloquence. *Flattery* is glib speech. *Sowing discord* means severing others’ close relationships. *Harming* means to injure. *False praise* means praising what should not be praised, a private act of deception. *Slandering* is like disgracing—destroying what should not be destroyed. When slander and praise arise from private motives, they are nothing but treachery. *Concealing* is deceit. *Adapting one’s countenance to others’ preferences* is called *facial compliance*. *Pleasing all without distinction* means courting favor with both good and bad alike, hence *two-faced*. *Probing others’ desires and subtly encouraging them* fosters their faults—such a person is treacherous. These *eight flaws* refer to eight grave moral diseases. *The noble person does not befriend them*—the noble person should not associate with such people. *The enlightened ruler does not employ them*—petty men must not be used, for they will surely throw the state into chaos.

*Delighting in great affairs* means taking pleasure in managing the state’s major matters. *Constantly altering and changing* means altering established laws to set up one’s own high reputation—*hanging* means elevating. *Presumptuous* means shameful. *Relying solely on private judgment*, monopolizing authority, encroaching on others’ power while delighting in self-assertion—this is greed. *Obstinate* means stubborn and refusing admonition. *Even when others have virtue*, if it differs from one’s own, one deems it unvirtuous—this is self-aggrandizement. These *four* are humanity’s great failings. Only by removing these flaws and perils can one begin to study the Dao, hence it is said, “Only then may one be taught.”

All these are what you should employ in navigating the world, hence it is said, “what you should use.” *Employing* means using them to examine oneself.

Confucius sighed deeply, bowed twice, and rose, saying: “I was twice exiled from Lu, my traces erased in Wei, my tree felled in Song, and I was besieged in Chen and Cai. I do not know what fault of mine brought these four slanders upon me—why was this?”

The guest’s expression turned somber as he replied: “How difficult it is for you to awaken! There was a man who feared his shadow and loathed his footprints, so he ran to escape them. The more he lifted his feet, the more footprints he made; the faster he ran, the more his shadow clung to him. Believing he was still too slow, he ran without rest until he collapsed and died. He did not know that by standing in the shade he could rest his shadow, and by remaining still he could cease his footprints—how utterly foolish!

You scrutinize the boundaries between benevolence and righteousness, examine the divisions of similarity and difference, observe the changes of movement and stillness, adjust the measures of giving and receiving, order the passions of like and dislike, and harmonize the moderation of joy and anger—yet you nearly could not avoid calamity. If you carefully cultivate yourself and guard your true nature, returning things to others, you will have no encumbrances. Now, instead of cultivating yourself, you seek from others—is this not misplaced?

*Not knowing what fault* means not knowing what error was committed. The *four slanders* refer to the four humiliations in Lu, Wei, Song, Chen, and Cai. *Standing in shade, remaining still*—this is a metaphor for the Dao. *Scrutinizing the boundaries between benevolence and righteousness* means debating the differing principles of benevolence and righteousness. *The divisions of similarity and difference* refer to the distinctions of right and wrong. *The changes of movement and stillness* mean adapting to the needs of the time. *The measures of giving and receiving* refer to the moderation of accepting and declining. *The passions of like and dislike, the moderation of joy and anger*—these clarify the principles of human nature.

The Fisherman’s meaning is that your actions, Master, are all for others rather than for yourself, which is why you could not escape the four slanders. If you cultivate yourself and guard your original, natural Dao, without opposition between self and others, you will have no encumbrances. *Returning things to others* means giving external things back to others and returning wholly to nature, so that self and others do not stand in opposition. Now, instead of seeking within yourself, you rush about serving others—this is attending to externals rather than internals.”

Confucius sighed deeply and said: “May I ask what is meant by *the true*?”

The guest replied: “The true is the utmost of sincerity. Without purity and sincerity, one cannot move others. Thus, forced weeping, though sorrowful, is not mournful; forced anger, though stern, lacks awe; forced affection, though smiling, is not harmonious. True sorrow is silent yet mournful; true anger, though unexpressed, is awe-inspiring; true affection, though not smiling, is harmonious. When the true resides within, the spirit moves without—this is why the true is prized.

Applied to human affairs: serving parents, it is filial devotion; serving a lord, it is loyalty; drinking wine, it is joy; mourning, it is grief. Loyalty is centered on accomplishment; drinking wine, on joy; mourning, on grief; serving parents, on suitability. When accomplishment is perfected, none resemble it; serving parents with suitability disregards the means; drinking wine with joy disregards the vessels; mourning with grief disregards the rites.

Rites are what the common customs establish; the true is what one receives from Heaven, natural and unalterable. Thus the sage models Heaven and prizes the true, not bound by custom. The foolish do the opposite: they cannot model Heaven but worry about people, not prizing the true, blindly following custom’s changes—hence they are inadequate. Alas! You were early immersed in human artifice and late to hear the great Dao.

Without purity and sincerity, one cannot move others—this is the meaning of utmost sincerity moving the spirits. *Forced weeping, forced anger, forced affection; true sorrow, true anger, true affection*—these six phrases are most precise. *When the true resides within, the spirit moves without*—what is within must manifest without. *The spirit moving* means the spirit is outwardly affected.

*Serving parents with suitability* means suiting the parents’ wishes.”

The beauty of accomplishment leaves no trace—it is achieved yet unpossessed, with no single act bearing its mark. *"Not selecting its instruments"* means not choosing its flavors. *"Without inquiring into its rites"*—between ease and sorrow, sorrow is preferable. Rites are mere adornments of externals, hence called the creations of worldly custom. The true is the principle of Heaven’s natural mandate. *"Modeling Heaven and prizing the true without being bound by custom"* means not being constrained by what worldly custom favors. *"Worrying about people"* means fretting over failing to conform to others. Not knowing the nobility of Heaven’s rank, one *"does not know to prize the true."* Taking worldly emoluments as one’s reward and willingly being transformed by vulgar custom—this is *"blindly following custom’s changes."* Such people are always seen as inadequate, their demeanor perpetually dissatisfied. *"Immersed in human artifice"* means drowning in learning that pursues externals.

Confucius bowed twice and rose, saying: *"Today I have been fortunate indeed. As if blessed by Heaven, you have not disdained to treat me as a servant, instructing me in person. Dare I ask where you dwell? I would follow and receive your teachings to complete my study of the great Dao."*

The stranger replied: *"I have heard that those who can be led may be guided to the subtle Dao; those who cannot be led do not understand the Way—beware of accompanying them, lest you bring harm upon yourself. Strive on, I leave you now, I leave you now."* With that, he poled his boat away, gliding along the reeds. Yan Yuan turned the carriage, and Zilu handed the reins, but Confucius did not look back, waiting until the water’s ripples stilled and the sound of the pole could no longer be heard before daring to board.

Zilu stepped beside the carriage and asked: *"I have long served you, yet never have I seen you meet someone with such reverence. Even rulers of ten thousand chariots or lords of a thousand, when they receive you, do not fail to observe proper courtesy, yet you still carry yourself with dignity. But today, this old fisherman stood with his staff facing you, and you bent at the waist, bowing deeply in response—was this not excessive? The disciples all find it strange. How has this fisherman earned such deference?"*

Confucius leaned on the crossbar and sighed: *"How difficult you are to transform, Zilu! You have been steeped in rites and righteousness for some time, yet your crude and rustic heart remains unchanged. Come closer, let me tell you: to meet an elder without respect is a breach of ritual; to meet a worthy without reverence is a lack of benevolence. If he were not a perfected person, he could not humble himself before others. Without utmost sincerity in humbling oneself, one cannot attain the true—thus one harms oneself for long. Alas, the lack of benevolence in a person! No greater misfortune exists, yet you alone cling to it. Moreover, the Dao is the path by which all things proceed. All beings that lose it die; those that attain it live. Acting against it brings failure; following it brings success. Thus, wherever the Dao resides, the sage honors it. This fisherman possesses the Dao—how could I not revere him? Comparing myself to a servant means treating him as a disciple. Asking where he dwells means inquiring about his abode. Gliding along the reeds describes poling the boat along the shore—a vivid four-character brushstroke. Waiting for the water’s ripples to still means the boat had gone far. 'Such reverence' refers to such awe and respect. 'Facing me' means standing directly opposite. Bowing in response means clasping hands in a bow. 'Steeped in rites and righteousness for some time' means you have long been immersed in the study of ritual and righteousness. 'If he were not a perfected person, he could not humble himself'—if this fisherman were not a perfected person, how could he elicit such deference and reverence? 'Without utmost sincerity in humbling oneself, one cannot attain the true'—only by wholeheartedly lowering oneself to seek instruction can one hope to hear true teachings. This is the foundation of learning. 'Thus one harms oneself for long' means that failing to do so brings no benefit to the self but only harm. The life and death of all things lie within the Dao, and the fisherman possesses it—thus I honor the Dao by revering him."*

From *"Yielding the Throne"* onward, the four chapters do not resemble Zhuangzi’s style. *"Yielding the Throne"* still contains one or two passages of merit, and *"The Old Fisherman"* also has its strengths, but *"Robber Zhi"* is even more distant from the truth than *"Discourse on Swords."* In *"Robber Zhi,"* the term *"prime minister"* is used, yet no such title existed in the Warring States period—this is clearly a later fabrication. The *Han Dynasty’s* *Art and Literature Annals* records fifty-two chapters of *Zhuangzi*, a number differing from the present text. The *Tang Dynasty* catalog lists only forty chapters, which are the ones now in circulation. It is unknown whether the fifty-two chapters included works like *"Yielding the Throne"* and *"Discourse on Swords,"* or if there were other chapters by Zhuangzi that have not survived.

When Lie Yukou was traveling to Qi, he turned back midway and encountered Bohun Maoren. Bohun Maoren asked: *"Why have you returned?"*

Lie Yukou replied: *"I was startled."*

*"What startled you?"*

*"I once drank at ten porridge stalls, and at five of them, they served me first."*

Bohun Maoren said: *"If that is so, why were you startled?"*

Lie Yukou replied: *"When inner sincerity is not dissolved, one’s demeanor shines with a radiant light, which externally pacifies others’ hearts, causing them to slight their elders and disregard their concerns. Those porridge-sellers merely peddle food and broth for profit—small gains from modest surpluses, their influence slight and their power light. Yet even they behaved thus—how much more so a ruler of ten thousand chariots? If I exhaust myself in service to the state and expend all my knowledge on affairs, he will entrust me with tasks and measure me by my achievements. That is why I was startled."*

Bohun Maoren said: *"A keen observation! If you conduct yourself thus, others will protect you."*

Not long after, when he went to visit, the shoes outside the door were piled high. Bohun Maoren stood facing north, leaning on his staff and pressing it against his chin. After standing for a while, he left without a word.

A visitor reported this to Liezi. Liezi, grasping his shoes, rushed barefoot to the gate and said: *"Master, since you have come, will you not dispense your remedy?"*

*"It is done,"* he replied. *"I had already told you that others would protect you—and so they have. It is not that you can make others protect you, nor that you cannot prevent them from doing so. What use is it to you? Their delight and surprise arise from your peculiarity. You must have stirred some response, disturbing your fundamental nature—all to no purpose. Those who wander with you offer no true counsel; their petty words are all poison to men. None awaken, none comprehend—how could they scrutinize one another? The cunning toil and the wise fret, while the incapable seek nothing. They eat and roam freely, drifting like an untethered boat—empty, they wander without restraint. Where is the turning back? Where do words return?*

*At a stall of ten porridge-sellers, five offered their wares first without waiting for purchase—such was the respect the man commanded. Harmony and compliance accumulate within, and blossoming brilliance emerges without: this is the teaching of the sages’ gate. If inner sincerity remains unresolved, it accumulates within but does not transform. ‘Resolution’ means transformation. ‘Planning’ means action. ‘Formed plans’ describe the appearance of conduct. Cheng Guang refers to one with radiant bearing—the outward manifestation of inner accumulation. Yet here, it is taken as a learning of visible traces. ‘To pacify the hearts of others’ means to subdue and win them over. It means: since I could not eliminate traces, others perceived them, and thus their hearts submitted in respect.*

*Zhaozhou said: ‘This old monk’s cultivation lacks strength; even ghosts and spirits see through it’—this is the same idea. The noble and the aged command respect, yet now, though neither old nor noble, the man is revered while others are slighted. This means his respect surpasses that of the noble and aged. ‘聚’ means to gather, to accumulate. Such matters, when accumulated over time, must become harmful. The more one’s fame and traces are exposed, the less one can escape the perils of the age. ‘Modest surpluses’ means their pursuit of profit seeks only excess, desiring more than mere gain. Those with power in the world can weigh others lightly or heavily. A porridge-seller is insignificant, initially lacking the power to influence others, yet even he could show such respect—how much more so a ruler?*

*When the body is wearied and wisdom exhausted, he will surely seek you out and employ you, demanding you present your achievements. This is what is meant by ‘disregarding their concerns.’ ‘Present’ means to offer. Bohun Maoren rejoiced in this, saying: ‘A keen observation!’—meaning you possess a single discerning eye. He also said: ‘You have stopped’—meaning you need not wander further, for others will gather to you and guard you as their teacher. ‘Stop’ means to remain. ‘已’ is an auxiliary particle. ‘Protect’ means to guard; ‘gather’ means the crowd guarding his gate. This single word ‘protect’ already hints at insufficiency, for Bohun Maoren’s vision rises yet higher. ‘The shoes outside the door were piled high’—his disciples were many. ‘Leaning on his staff and pressing it against his chin’ means he planted his staff firmly and rested it against his chin. ‘蹙’ means to press. ‘A visitor’ refers to one who receives guests.*

*‘Dispense your remedy’ means to instruct, enlighten, and treat like medicine. ‘It is done’ means ‘say no more.’ I had already told you that others would guard you. You cannot prevent them from protecting you—this is what is meant by ‘forgetting oneself is easy, but making others forget you is difficult.’ ‘What use is it to you?’ means: why have you acted thus? Those who are moved and delighted by you must be unable to contain themselves, causing their peculiarities to manifest outwardly—hence ‘delight and surprise arise from peculiarity.’ Since you are thus, not only can you not conceal your outward manifestations, but you must also stir and shake your fundamental nature—this is of no benefit to your person. ‘No purpose’ means ‘no benefit.’ ‘又’ here intensifies the meaning."*

Those who accompany you in your journeys are your friends, yet their learning remains incomplete, their words shallow and common—hence they are called "petty words." Their speech is capable of poisoning and harming others, and since none can admonish or correct you, you will never awaken. Who, then, would still inquire how you fare?

*Xiangshu* means "to inquire of one another"—the sense of mutual questioning. All people in the world: the cunning inevitably exhaust themselves, the wise inevitably torment themselves. Only those who embody the Dao and follow nature without employing their abilities make no demands upon external things, content merely to eat their fill and wander at leisure. They drift like an untethered boat, their hearts unattached to anything. This culminates in the single word *xu* (emptiness). Emptiness unites with the great void, and thus they wander at the origin of things. *Wu neng* ("without ability") is the meaning of *wu wei* ("non-action").

Among the people of Zheng, there was Huan, who chanted and intoned over the land of the Sang clan. After just three years, Huan became a Confucian scholar. His virtue moistened the land for nine *li*, and his beneficence extended to three generations, even enabling his younger brother to study Mohism. When the Confucian and Mohist brothers debated, their father sided with Di. After ten years, Huan took his own life. His father dreamed of him, saying: "It was I who made your son a Mohist." He then looked toward his grave, where the cypress and cedar had already borne fruit. The Creator’s retribution does not punish the person but the Heaven within the person—thus it was destined for him.

People consider themselves distinct from others, despising their kin. The villagers of Qi who drew water from the same well would seize one another. Thus it is said: "All in this world are Huan." From this, those with virtue pretend ignorance—how much more so those with the Dao?

In ancient times, this was called "the punishment of fleeing from Heaven." *Shen yin* means "to chant and intone." *Zhi san nian* ("just three years") means "exactly three years." *He run jiu li* ("the river moistens nine *li*") is a metaphor for the breadth of his beneficence. With his remaining resources, he enabled his younger brother to study Mohism. Huan became a Confucian, while his brother Di became a Mohist; their differing studies led to debates. Their father, favoring the younger brother, sided with him, and Huan, resenting his father, killed himself. He then appeared in his father’s dream, saying: "It was my residual beneficence that enabled your son to become a Mohist." Now that the brothers had quarreled to the point of suicide, the pines and cypresses on his grave had already grown and borne fruit—signifying the length of time since his death.

*Liang* may also be written as *yin* (pronounced *lang*), meaning "grave." *He hu chang shi qi liang* ("Why did he ever look at his grave?") means: "Why did he not look upon my grave?" *He* and *hu* both mean "why."

Zhuangzi then proceeded to judge this past event, saying: Huan believed it was he who enabled his brother to study Mohism, yet he did not understand that in the workings of creation there is a principle of retribution for men—one that does not respond to human ability but rather to what a person has received from Heaven. That his brother studied Mohism and mastered it was Heaven’s response to his innate nature, not something achieved by Huan’s human effort in providing resources. "It was Heaven that enabled him"—the first "him" refers to creation, the second to his brother Di. As for Huan, he considered himself exceptional, believing his study of Confucianism had extended his beneficence to three generations, surpassing others. In scorning his kin—resenting his father—he showed he did not comprehend Heaven’s design. A wellspring flows from nature itself. *Zuo* means to wrestle or grapple in conflict. The people of Qi drank from natural waters and fought over them, yet was that water their private possession? Their perception was the same as Huan’s. People today, unaware of Heaven, contend with private motives, and so it is said: the people of this age are all Huans.

Observe how "it was Heaven that enabled him" and the passage on well-water drinking are quintessentially Zhuangzian prose. How could such language appear in the four chapters beginning with *Yielding the Throne*? Even those of virtue regard creation as unfathomable—how much more so those who have attained the Dao?

Zhuangzi’s words often suggest that beyond one layer lies another, hence the distinction between those of the Dao and those of virtue. To flee from Heaven is to abandon one’s Heavenly principle. To be punished is to offend creation. This line reproaches those like Huan. The sage finds peace in what is naturally so and does not seek peace where it cannot be; the multitude finds peace where it should not and cannot find peace where it should. Zhuangzi said: Knowing the Dao is easy; refraining from speech is difficult. To know and not speak is to align with Heaven; to know and speak is to align with man. The ancients aligned with Heaven, not man.

What is naturally so is the principle of spontaneity; what is not naturally so is human contrivance. "Refraining from speech is difficult" means it is hard to forget words. To know the Dao and forget speech is to become Heaven’s companion; to know the Dao yet not forget speech is still entangled in human artifice, still bound by traces. The ancients were purely of Heaven, not man. *Zhi* means "to be" or "to go." "To align with Heaven" and "to align with man" convey the idea of returning to Heaven or man.

Zhu Pingman studied dragon-slaying under Zhi Liyi, exhausting a thousand gold pieces from his family. After three years, his skill was perfected, yet he had no use for his craft. *Dan* means "to exhaust," signifying he spent all his wealth. Though his learning was complete, there were no dragons to slay—this metaphor speaks for itself. Zhuangzi’s Dao is vast and has no place for application.

The sage treats the inevitable as if it were not, thus avoiding conflict; the multitude treats the inevitable as if it were not, thus inviting strife. To follow conflict is to act with desire; to rely on conflict is to perish. The inevitable is the unknowable. To treat the unknowable as knowable is to claim knowledge of the unknown. "Avoiding conflict" means avoiding contention. The multitude takes what cannot be certain and makes it certain, hence their many disputes. They resort to arms to settle them—here, the greatest conflicts are cited as examples. If one follows the heart of contention, one’s conduct in the world will always seek adversaries, for the distinction between self and others cannot be forgotten. Thus it is said: to follow conflict is to act with desire. To rely on the struggle of knowledge and power is to court one’s own destruction. Thus it is said: to rely on conflict is to perish.

The petty man’s knowledge does not extend beyond bribes and inquiries, wasting his spirit on such things. Shallow and narrow, he yet seeks to guide and benefit all things, to embody the Great Unity and formless emptiness. Such a one is deluded by the cosmos, burdened by form, and unaware of the Great Beginning. The perfected person, however, returns his spirit to the beginningless and finds sweet repose in the realm of nothingness.

*Baoju* refers to gifts; *gandu* to mutual inquiries and courtesies—these are trivial, insignificant matters. The petty man exhausts his spirit, considering such things wisdom, and seeks to benefit all under Heaven, to guide the myriad things toward the Great Unity’s origin and formless mystery. How could this be achieved? *Xingxu* means formless. With such limited vision, he is bewildered by the universe—space above and below, time past and future—and, burdened by form, remains ignorant of the Great Beginning’s natural principle. Only the perfected person returns his spirit to the beginning of nothingness and dwells content in the realm of non-action. *Gan* means "pleasing"; *ming*, "sleep." The metaphor of sweet sleep illustrates contented dwelling.

Water flows from the formless and disperses into the Great Purity. Alas! You take knowledge to reside in the finest hair yet do not know great tranquility. People see water flowing as if it had form, yet do not realize it originates from the formless—speaking of existence arising from non-existence. When it disperses and departs, they do not know it returns to the Great Purity. The Great Purity is the Great Void. This analogy laments that ordinary people, like those observing water, do not grasp the beginning and end of things. Thus it is said: "knowledge resides in the finest hair," meaning their perception is small. Great tranquility is the principle of non-action and spontaneity. The phrase "Alas!" precedes "you take," lamenting their narrow vision.

There was a man of Song named Cao Shang who was sent by the King of Song as an envoy to Qin. On his departure, he received several carriages; the king, pleased with him, added a hundred more. Returning to Song, he visited Zhuangzi and said: "To dwell in a cramped alley, impoverished and weaving sandals, with a withered neck and sallow face—this is what I am unskilled at..."

A single awakening to a ruler of ten thousand chariots, followed by a hundred chariages—this is my strength."

Zhuangzi said: "The King of Qin fell ill and summoned physicians. Those who lanced boils and drained abscesses received one chariot; those who licked his hemorrhoids received five chariots. The baser the treatment, the greater the reward. Did you, perchance, treat his hemorrhoids? How else could you have gained so many chariots? Begone!

'Cramped and weaving sandals' speaks of poverty and self-made footwear. 'Withered neck and sallow face' speaks of old age. A withered neck is gaunt and fleshless; a sallow face is yellowed and sunken at the temples. An abscess is akin to a boil. Boils appear above, hemorrhoids below—yet the lower the cure, the richer the reward. To gain chariots by licking hemorrhoids is base, a humiliation unworthy of esteem."

Duke Ai of Lu asked Yan He: "I regard Confucius as the state’s pillar; will the realm not be well-ordered?" Yan He replied: "Perilous indeed! Dangerous and crumbling! Confucius adorns feathers with paint, engages in florid speech, exalts the branch over the root, and forces his nature to govern the people—yet he neither knows nor trusts himself. His heart clings to this, his spirit is ruled by it. How could he be fit to lead the people? Does he truly benefit you, or do you merely sustain him? You would be deceived. Now, if you cause the people to abandon truth and study falsity, this is no way to instruct them. If you consider posterity, it would be better to cease. A steadfast pillar suffices to support affairs.

The *Book of Songs* says: 'The pillar of the state.' A steadfast pillar is like a worthy assistant. 'There is healing' means the state’s ills can yet be cured. *Ji* means peril; *dai* likewise means danger. 'Perilous indeed! Dangerous and crumbling!'—this is extreme peril. *Hua* means color; after coloring an object, he further adorns it with feathers—his embellishments are excessive. 'Florid speech' refers to ornate, extravagant words. 'Exalting the branch over the root' means his guiding principle lacks foundation. 'Forcing his nature' means artificial zeal. 'Governing the people' means standing above them. 'Neither knows nor trusts' means he does not recognize his own insincerity. 'His heart clings to this' means his heart is fixated on it. 'His spirit is ruled by it' means his spirit takes it as its master. 'How could he be fit to lead the people?' means he is unfit to guide them. 'He' refers to the Master; 'you' refers to Duke Ai. 'Does he truly benefit you?'—thus he says, 'Does he suit you?' *Yi* means to nourish. If you regard him as worthy and sustain him, he will bring you no benefit but only deception. 'Deceived, perhaps' means deception may well occur. Now, if you cause the people of the state to abandon truth and learn deceit, this is no way to teach them. *Shi* means to instruct. If you consider posterity, it would be better to cease. *Xiu* means to stop.

Difficult to govern! To act upon others yet not forget it is not the Heavenly Way. Merchants are not esteemed; even if circumstances force one to rank with them, the spirit does not esteem them. External punishments are metal and wood; internal punishments are action and transgression. When petty men incur external punishments, metal and wood interrogate them; when they incur internal punishments, yin and yang consume them. Only the true person can escape both internal and external punishments.

The people need not be governed; to govern with intent is to make governance difficult—thus it is called 'difficult to govern.' 'To act upon others yet not forget' means governing with intent. *Shi* means to administer policy. *Bu* means to display. The Heavenly Way is the Heavenly Principle. To administer policy and instruction with intent is not the Heavenly Principle. It is like merchants: a gentleman would never rank with them, and even if circumstances force a gathering, his spirit remains displeased. Likewise, a person of the Dao would not rank with those who act with intent. This analogy likens merchants to scholars of benevolence and righteousness.

External punishments are the blade, saw, and cangue; internal punishments are action and transgression. A person’s movements and faults are akin to corporal punishment. *Xun* means interrogation. 'Yin and yang consume them' means they are afflicted by the Creator’s reproach. *Shi* is like the eclipse of the sun—it brings illness. The first clause describes external punishment; the second, internal. *Li* means attachment.

Confucius said: "In general, the human heart is more treacherous than mountains and rivers, harder to know than Heaven. Heaven has its seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer, dawn, and dusk—but man has a thick exterior and deep emotions. Thus, some appear honest yet seek profit; some seem talented yet conceal their abilities; some are gentle and yielding yet discerning; some appear firm yet are weak and pliant; some seem slow yet are quick-tempered. Therefore, those who rush to righteousness are as thirsty for it as they are eager to flee it. Thus, the gentleman sends them far to observe their loyalty, brings them near to observe their respect, burdens them to observe their ability, questions them suddenly to observe their knowledge, sets urgent deadlines to observe their trustworthiness, entrusts them with wealth to observe their benevolence, warns them of danger to observe their integrity, intoxicates them with wine to observe their restraint, and mingles them with others to observe their demeanor. When all nine tests are complete, the unworthy are revealed.

'Thick exterior and deep emotions' means that feigned appearances are not easily seen, and hidden feelings are not easily fathomed. Some appear simple and honest yet secretly seek profit; some harbor great talent yet outwardly seem incapable. *Bu xiao* means 'not resembling.' Some are gentle and yielding yet discerning; *man* means entangling. Some seem firm yet are weak and pliant—*The Book of Songs* says: 'Once a hundred-fold refined steel, now pliable as a finger’s curl.' *Man* means to curl around a finger. *Han* means urgency. Some seem slow yet are quick-tempered. All this shows how inscrutable people are. 'Rushing to righteousness as if thirsty' describes their fervent advance."

Those who abandon righteousness as if scorched retreat swiftly—this describes their hasty withdrawal. The phrase "advancing fervently, retreating swiftly" is thus rendered with striking precision.

Those far apart are easily deceived, so observe their loyalty from afar. Those close and intimate are prone to familiarity and disrespect, so observe their reverence up close. Those tasked with urgent and complex matters may falter under pressure, so assign them sudden burdens to test their competence. Those slow to perceive hesitate in response, so question them abruptly to gauge their wisdom. Pressing deadlines easily lead to broken promises, so impose tight schedules to assess their trustworthiness. Facing wealth, one may resort to improper gain, so entrust them with riches to observe their benevolence—here, *benevolence* aligns with the term *Dao/Way*. Confronted with peril, one may seek cowardly escape, so warn them of danger to examine their integrity. Wine clouds the mind, so observe their dignity when drunk. Beauty bewitches, so place them in mixed company to see if they maintain self-restraint. *Zheng* means verification. Testing them through these nine methods reveals the worthy from the unworthy.

This passage’s reasoning is sound, though attributed to Confucius, showing that Zhuangzi was not disrespectful toward him. When Zheng Kaofu received his first appointment, he stooped; at the second, he bent; at the third, he prostrated himself, shuffling along walls—who would dare not follow his example? Yet there are those who, upon their first appointment, strut with arrogance; at the second, dance atop chariots; and at the third, address elders by name—who could reconcile such conduct with the ways of Yao and Xu You? *Yu* means a hunched back; *lou*, a bent waist; *fu*, bowing to the ground—all signify that the higher one’s rank, the lower one’s posture. Shuffling along walls shows one dares not walk the main path, embodying humility. If the world had such virtuous men, who would not take them as models? *Gui* means model. *Er fu* refers to such men. *Lü ju* describes a haughty demeanor; dancing on chariots, frivolous behavior; calling elders by name, arrogance toward kin. *Tang* refers to Yao; *Xu*, to Xu You. Yao offered the throne to Xu You, who refused—how could such petty men, upon slight success, grow so arrogant, oblivious to the examples of Yao and Xu You? *Xie* means alignment. Comparing them to Yao and Xu You reveals the disparity. *Shu xie* asks: who could align them with such paragons?

No thief is greater than one whose virtue is deliberate, whose mind has eyes—once it has eyes and turns inward, inward vision leads to ruin. These words strike closest to the heart of those who pursue the Dao/Way. Chan Buddhists call this the "leaking mind" or the "second thought," capturing this very idea. *De/virtue* here means "to practice virtue." To practice virtue while being conscious of it is to act with intent—this is the greatest hindrance to those on the Dao/Way, hence "no thief is greater than one whose virtue is deliberate." Within this intent, if one begins calculating and scheming, it is as if the mind grows another eye—this is the "leaking mind," the "second thought." With this eye turned inward, distinctions multiply, chaos reigns, and the primordial unity is lost, leaving no path to the Dao/Way. Thus, it is called *ruin*—failure.

There are five pernicious virtues, with the central one foremost. What is the central virtue? It is self-satisfaction that scorns what one does not do. The five pernicious virtues correspond to the heart, ears, eyes, nose, and mouth, with the central virtue being the heart. The harm of the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth does not compare to that of the heart, hence "the central virtue is foremost." *Having self-satisfaction* means believing in one’s own abilities. *Pi* means to disparage or mock. To belittle others for what they cannot do is to render the heart unfit for the Dao/Way. The *Yuanjue Sutra* says: "Do not disdain long practice or slight beginners." Dahui warned: "Never think, 'I understand, they do not'—this is the very meaning here."

Exhaustion has eight extremes, success three certainties, and the body six repositories. Handsome beards, tall stature, robust build, radiant beauty, strength, courage, and boldness—eight traits surpassing others—lead to ruin when relied upon. Compliance, adaptability, and timidity, though inferior to others, ensure smooth passage. Wisdom and cunning, when outwardly displayed, breed resentment; courage and daring invite grievances; benevolence and righteousness bring reproach. Those who grasp the essence of life are enigmatic; those who grasp knowledge are elusive. Those who grasp the great mandate follow; those who grasp the small mandate encounter.

*Exhaustion has eight extremes* means that reliance on any trait leads to ruin. *Success has three certainties* means that those who humbly acknowledge their shortcomings will inevitably thrive. *Beautiful* refers to appearance; *ran*, to having a beard (as Fang Xuanling said of Li Wei’s beard). *Tall* means height; *large*, girth; *strong*, physical power; *radiant*, splendor; *brave*, vigor; *daring*, resolve. These are the eight extremes—traits that surpass others. Relying on them leads to ruin. *Compliance* means yielding and adapting to circumstances. *Adaptability* means rising after falling. *Timidity* means distress and fear. These three traits, though inferior to others, ensure smooth passage, as people favor those who do not compete. These are Zhuangzi’s contrarian arguments.

*The body has six repositories* refers to the six accumulations within the human form. *Repository* means a place of storage. Wisdom is one repository; *outwardly displayed* means applying wisdom externally to seek success. Courage is another; relying on strength breeds resentment. Benevolence and righteousness form another; seeking fame through them invites reproach.

Kuai (sounds like "魁").

*Attaining life* is one repository—violating the principles of life leads to haughty self-exaltation. *Attaining knowledge* is another—grasping the insights of the multitude necessitates scrutinizing every matter. Xiao (sounds like "消").

*Attaining destiny* is another repository. That which lies with Heaven is great; that which lies with oneself is small. To attain what lies with Heaven is to follow and yield to it, heeding nature. To attain what lies with oneself is to accept whatever one encounters as fate. Though encounters may bring gain or loss, a heart that entrusts itself to destiny remains free of attachment. These two are distinct in meaning. The six repositories conclude with the character *destiny*, which is elaborated into two clauses—this is a matter of literary structure.

There was a man who had an audience with the King of Song. The king bestowed upon him ten carriages, and with these ten carriages, he grew arrogant toward Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi said: "By the river lived a poor family who made their living weaving reeds. Their son dived into the depths and obtained a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces. His father said to him, 'Bring a stone and pound it!' For a pearl of such value must lie in the ninefold abyss beneath the chin of a black dragon. That you could obtain it means you must have encountered the dragon while it slept. Had the black dragon been awake, what scrap of you would have remained?"

"Now, the depths of the state of Song are not merely a ninefold abyss, and the King of Song is fiercer than a black dragon. That you could obtain these carriages means you must have encountered him while he slept. Had the King of Song been awake, you would have been ground to powder."

*Arrogance* here means haughty condescension, as if patting Zhuangzi like a child. *Weaving* means to plait; *reeds* are rushes. This is the same as the character for "编曲." They relied on this craft for sustenance, selling their wares. "Bring a stone and pound it" expresses disdain for the pearl and the desire to destroy it. This analogy illustrates that those who seek wealth and rank tread a perilous path, deceiving their ruler. If the ruler awakens, they will surely face execution. "What scrap of you would have remained" means being devoured without a trace.

Someone sent an invitation to Zhuangzi, who replied to the messenger: "Have you seen the sacrificial ox? It is clothed in embroidered silk and fed with fine hay and beans. Yet when it is led into the grand temple, though it may wish to be a lone calf, how could that be possible?" This echoes the earlier passage about the turtle dragging its tail in the mud.

When Zhuangzi was near death, his disciples wished to bury him with lavish rites. Zhuangzi said: "I take heaven and earth as my inner and outer coffins, the sun and moon as my paired jades, the stars and constellations as my pearls and beads, and the myriad things as my funeral gifts. Are not my burial preparations already complete? What could be added to them?"

His disciples said: "We fear that crows and kites will feast on you."

Zhuangzi replied: "Above, I would be eaten by crows and kites; below, by ants and mole crickets. To snatch me from one to give to the other—how partial you are!" This was a rebuke of those in his time who practiced extravagant burials. To take from crows and kites to give to ants and mole crickets is partiality. Though his words may seem extreme, they are not easily matched by those who have not truly attained the Dao.

To level with what is not level is to fail to achieve levelness; to verify with what is unverified is to fail to achieve verification. The enlightened are but servants of things; the spiritually attuned verify them. That the enlightened cannot surpass the spiritually attuned has long been so. Yet fools rely on their limited perceptions to impose upon others, seeking merit in externals—is this not lamentable?

The principles of the myriad things are fundamentally level. If I use an unlevel mind to level what is already level, then what was level becomes unlevel. The principles of the myriad things are each verifiable. If I use an unverified mind to verify them, then what was verifiable becomes unverified. Thus it is said: to level with what is not level is to fail to achieve levelness; to verify with what is unverified is to fail to achieve verification.

*Verification* means confirmation. "Servants of things" describes those who, though they do nothing, are made to act as if by something else—this is to impose intention where there is none. The enlightened are often burdened in this way. As for the spiritually attuned, they simply allow things to respond naturally. That the enlightened cannot surpass the spiritually attuned means that human effort cannot surpass non-action. Fools rely on their private views to impose upon others, constantly seeking merit in externals—is this not lamentable?

Lin Xiyi of Yanzhai Studio, *Miscellaneous Chapters: "The World"*

The world abounds with those who cultivate methods of governance, each deeming their own approach unsurpassable. Yet where, truly, does the ancient *Dao*-art reside? It is said: nowhere it is not present. Then by what means does the numinous descend, and from whence does clarity emerge? The sage’s arising and the king’s accomplishment both originate from the One. Not departing from the Source is called the "Heavenly Person." Not departing from essence is called the "Spiritual Person." Not departing from the authentic is called the "Perfected Person." Taking Heaven as their source, virtue as their root, and the Dao as their gate, presaging through transformation—this is the sage. Taking benevolence as their thought, righteousness as their principle, propriety as their conduct, and music as their harmony, suffused with compassion and kindness—this is the noble person. Taking law as their division, names as their markers, conduct as their verification, and examination as their judgment—such is the enumeration of one, two, three, four, by which the hundred officials rank themselves. Taking duty as their norm, clothing and food as their priority, they foster growth, store provisions, and care for the elderly, the weak, the orphaned, and the widowed—all to nurture the people. Such is the governance of the common folk.

The ancients were truly complete. They matched the divine luminaries, harmonized with Heaven and Earth, nurtured the myriad things, brought harmony to the world, and extended their blessings to the hundred clans. Clear about fundamental principles and connected to the yet-unmeasured, their operation—encompassing the six directions and the four openings, the refined and the coarse, the great and the small—was nowhere absent. Those manifestations of clarity that reside in measures and degrees are still largely preserved in the transmitted records of ancient laws. Those found in the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music* are often elucidated by the scholars of Zou and Lu, the girdle-wearing masters. The *Odes* guide the will, the *Documents* guide affairs, the *Rites* guide conduct, the *Music* guides harmony, the *Changes* guide yin and yang, and the *Spring and Autumn* guide names and duties. These principles, dispersed throughout the world and established in the Central States, are at times expounded and transmitted by the hundred schools.

Yet when the world fell into great disorder, the worthy and the sagely were obscured, the Dao and virtue were no longer unified, and the world’s people each grasped but a single insight to cherish as their own. Like the ear, eye, nose, and mouth—each possessing its own clarity yet unable to communicate with the others—so too are the hundred schools and their various arts, each possessing its own strength and occasional utility. Nevertheless, they are neither comprehensive nor all-encompassing, being but partial scholars. To judge the beauty of Heaven and Earth, to analyze the principles of the myriad things, to examine the wholeness of the ancients—few can fully embody the beauty of Heaven and Earth or match the countenance of the divine luminaries. Thus, the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship has grown dim and obscured, stifled and unexpressed. The people of the world each pursue what they desire, fashioning their own methods.

Alas! The hundred schools have gone forth and not returned; they will surely never converge. Later scholars, unfortunate in not witnessing the purity of Heaven and Earth or the greatness of the ancients, will see the *Dao*-art rent asunder by the world.

In the final chapter, Zhuangzi’s preface on the learning of past and present resembles the closing of Mencius’ work, where "hearing knowledge" and "seeing knowledge" are discussed. From "The world abounds with those who cultivate methods of governance" to "the *Dao*-art will be rent asunder by the world," it serves as a clear introduction. Having provided this general preface, he then proceeds to discuss the various schools, placing his own work among them. Yet the learning of Zou and Lu is expounded within the general preface, revealing that this elder’s intent was never to dismiss the Confucian tradition as merely one-sided or extreme—he was well aware that the Sage’s gate was the true standard. Reading this preface, one sees that his learning was fundamentally sound. As Su Dongpo observed, Zhuangzi never disparaged the Master.

*Fangshu* means "learning" or "art." Each person deems their own learning unsurpassable, for all are self-assured. The ancient *Dao*-art—this *yan* (衍) is akin to "benevolent arts" or "heart arts." Where does it reside? Nowhere it is not present—this conveys the idea of the "mean in timing," for though the hundred schools differ, the Dao is never absent from their midst. By what means does the numinous descend, and from whence does clarity emerge? This asks how the Way of spirit and luminosity may be perceived. The sage’s accomplishments in arising and the king’s in completion are the same as the principles of Heaven and Earth’s generation—all originate from the One. The One is creation itself. "Source," "essence," and "authentic" are all synonymous with the One, differing only in phrasing.

Taking Heaven as their source, virtue as their root, and the Dao as their gate—all are non-action and spontaneity. "Presaging through transformation" is the same as "originating from the One." The sage is thus the Heavenly Person, the Perfected Person, and the Spiritual Person. "Suffused with compassion and kindness" describes their demeanor. Laws entail distinctions, hence "taking law as their division." Names serve as standards, hence "taking names as their markers." "Taking conduct as their verification" and "examination as their judgment" mean that their verifications and judgments are each grounded in evidence. The enumeration of one, two, three, four signifies meticulous clarity in all details. "Ranking themselves" means that great and small, high and low are ordered. "Taking duty as their norm" means each has a regular office. "Taking clothing and food as their priority" means teaching the people agriculture and sericulture. "Fostering growth and storing provisions" refers to practices like storing a year’s food for every three years of farming. "Caring for the elderly, the weak, the orphaned, and the widowed" means that in enacting governance and bestowing benevolence, these four groups must come first. All their divisions of offices, arrangements of duties, governance, and instruction are for the nurturing of the people.

"The ancients were truly complete" means the ancient sages could fulfill all these. They could match the divine luminaries and harmonize with Heaven and Earth. "Harmonized" means attuned. "Nurturing the myriad things, harmonizing the world, extending blessings to the hundred clans" describes the vastness of their efficacy. "Fundamental principles and yet-unmeasured degrees" are akin to "refined and coarse, root and branch." "Connected" means interrelated, signifying that root and branch do not depart from one another. "Six directions and four openings" mean east, west, south, north, above, and below—nowhere is unusable. "Operation" means the Dao.

The operation of the Dao encompasses the small and large, refined and coarse—all are the Dao, hence it is said to be present everywhere without exception. Examining these several lines, one sees that the substance and function of the Dao are never left obscure.

Numerical standards and degrees are what can be recorded, meaning their methods and measures—clear and traceable—are all transmitted through established models of past ages. *Shi* refers to written records. There are still many such accounts, for all these matters are documented therein.

The scholars of Zou and Lu, the girdled gentlemen—these refer to the sagely lineage, explicitly speaking of Confucius’ Six Classics. The *Spring and Autumn* upholds proper names and distinctions, for even the two words "names and distinctions" already contain a warning against rebellious ministers and traitorous sons. Their teachings spread throughout the world, meaning that while Zou and Lu preserved the complete tradition, its learning dispersed across the land, establishing instruction in the Central States and branching into a hundred schools. There were still those who occasionally spoke of these matters, yet none could match the completeness of the learning of Zou and Lu.

The great disorder of the world refers to the period after the *Spring and Autumn*. The worthy and sagely were no longer manifest; above, there were no Wen or Wu, no Duke of Zhou, and below, no disciples like Confucius or Yan Hui. The Way and virtue were no longer unified, scattering into a hundred schools. Many in the world grasped but a single fragment, examining it and taking pride in it, meaning they merely scrutinized one aspect and boasted of it. The ears, eyes, nose, and mouth cannot function interchangeably—ears cannot see, eyes cannot hear, mouths cannot smell, noses cannot taste—each follows its own capacity, hence it is said that each has its own clarity. This analogy applies to the hundred schools and their various arts: each has its strengths and may be useful at times, yet none can fully encompass the comprehensive Way of the sages. Thus, they are but partial and one-sided scholars.

The beauty of Heaven and Earth is thereby divided and incomplete; the principles of the myriad things are thereby fragmented and discordant. If one examines them through the complete learning of the ancients, one knows that the one-sidedness of the hundred schools rarely embodies the full beauty of Heaven and Earth or matches the countenance of the divine luminaries. *Beauty* refers to the Dao within, its substance; *countenance* refers to the Dao without, its function. *Matching* means being fitting. Few can truly match the countenance of the divine luminaries, meaning they fall short of being fitting.

Inward sageliness is substance; outward kingship is function. With the Dao of inner and outer thus obscured, each person pursues what they desire and fashions their own methods. The learning of the hundred schools, from this point onward, has strayed and cannot return, making reunification impossible. Later scholars cannot perceive the pure wholeness of Heaven and Earth or the complete body of the ancient Way—this is the misfortune of later ages.

The arts of the Dao in the world have since become fragmented, hence it is said, "The arts of the Dao will be torn asunder throughout the world." This concluding line is exceptionally forceful and finely wrought.

Not extravagant toward later ages, not wasteful toward the myriad things, not dazzled by numerical standards, yet using the carpenter’s line to correct oneself and prepare for the world’s emergencies—such were the ancient arts of the Dao. Mo Di and Qin Guli, hearing of this approach, delighted in it. Yet they carried it to excess, imposing rigid uniformity, creating the doctrine of "opposing music" and calling it "frugality." They forbade singing in life and mourning in death; Mozi advocated universal love, mutual benefit, and opposition to conflict. His Way eschewed anger, and he was fond of learning and transmitting without deviation, yet he did not align with the former kings, instead condemning the rites and music of antiquity.

The Yellow Emperor had the *Xianchi*, Yao the *Dazhang*, Shun the *Dashao*, Yu the *Daxia*, Tang the *Huo*, King Wen the music of the *Biyong*, and King Wu and the Duke of Zhou composed the *Wu*. In ancient mourning rites, noble and base had their proper forms, superior and inferior their respective ranks. The Son of Heaven had seven layers of inner and outer coffins, the feudal lords five, high ministers three, and officers two. Yet Mozi alone forbade singing in life and mourning in death, using a paulownia coffin three inches thick without an outer coffin as the model. Teaching others thus seems unloving; practicing it oneself is surely self-neglect.

This does not yet defeat Mozi’s Way. Yet to sing yet oppose singing, to weep yet oppose weeping, to delight yet oppose delight—is this truly reasonable? Their lives are toilsome, their deaths meager; their Way is harsh, causing people sorrow and grief. Their conduct is difficult to uphold, and one fears it cannot be the Way of the sages. It runs counter to the hearts of the world, and the world cannot endure it. Though Mozi alone could bear it, what could he do about the world? Separated from the world, he is far from the kingly Way.

Mozi spoke of the Dao, saying: "In ancient times, Yu controlled the floodwaters, dredged the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, and connected the four barbarians and the nine provinces. There were three hundred famous rivers, three thousand tributaries, and countless smaller streams. Yu personally wielded the spade and basket, mingling with the laborers across the land’s rivers. His calves bore no flesh, his shins no hair; he bathed in heavy rain and combed his hair in fierce winds, establishing ten thousand states. Yu was a great sage, yet he wearied his body for the world." Thus, later Mohists often wore coarse garments of felt and hempen sandals, laboring day and night without rest, taking self-imposed hardship as the ultimate virtue. Those who could not endure this were deemed unworthy of the Mohist name and insufficient to be called followers of Yu.

The disciples of Xiangli Qin and the followers of Wu Hou, along with the southern Mohists like Ku Huo, Ji Chi, and Deng Lingzi, all recited the Mohist canon yet diverged in their interpretations, calling one another "deviant Mohists." They engaged in debates over the "hard and white" and "same and different," responding to one another with sophistry and contrariness. They revered the *Juzi* as a sage, all wishing to serve as his representative, hoping to succeed him, yet to this day they remain unresolved.

Mo Di and Qin Guli’s intentions were sound, but their conduct was misguided. They would have later Mohists necessarily wear themselves out—calves without flesh, shins without hair—competing in asceticism. This is the height of disorder and the nadir of governance.

Though indeed, Mozi was truly one who loved the world—one whom one might seek in vain, yet even if he withered away, he would not abandon his cause. A man of true talent! He did not indulge later generations, nor did he teach them indulgence. "Lavishness" means adornment; he did not take the embellishments of the myriad things as adornment. "Radiance" means splendor; he did not take ritual, music, measures, or numbers as radiant splendor. The "inked line" was self-restraint; he restrained himself to correct the world, desiring that all under Heaven have abundance. His intent lay in frugality to ensure sufficiency, thus he spoke of meeting the world’s urgent needs, for people take clothing and food as urgent, leading to strife and disorder.

Among the arts of the Dao of antiquity, there were those that resided in this. Yet only Mo Di and Qin Guli heard of this teaching and rejoiced in it, hence it is said they "heard its wind and delighted in it." Precisely because they rejoiced in it, they proceeded to act upon it. "Excessive" means going too far. "Following" means compliance; "great compliance" refers to their doctrine’s overbearing restraint, thus it is called "their own great compliance." "Their own" conveys the sense of suppression. *Against Music* and *Moderation in Use* are chapter titles in Mozi’s writings. Having composed these, Mozi desired that in life, people would not sing—rejecting music—and in death, they would have no mourning garments, nearing bare burial, all to moderate use. "Universal love and mutual benefit" meant loving all without exception, thus deeming strife wrong and non-anger the Way. "Broad and undifferentiated" meant esteeming uniformity. Expanding his doctrine to serve as instruction, he centered it on esteeming uniformity. Though he sought unity, his teachings did not align with the former kings. From the Yellow Emperor to King Wu, none had done without music, yet Mozi sought to abolish it. From ancient times, from the noble to the base, none had lacked mourning rites, yet Mozi sought to abolish them, setting a standard of three-inch coffins without outer coffins—moderation in use. Teaching people thus was too harsh, hence it is said, "I fear this does not love others," for it is not the way to love people. "Not loving oneself" means self-affliction. "Ultimate ruin" means Mozi’s Way, in the end, cannot be practiced. People cannot live without song, yet Mozi deemed song wrong; human nature cannot do without weeping, yet Mozi deemed weeping wrong; they cannot do without joy, yet he deemed joy wrong. His Way was entirely removed from human sentiment, thus it is said, "Does this truly resemble it?" "Resemble" means proximity. Does this truly align with human sentiment? In life, they toiled in hardship; in death, they practiced meager burials. "Too crude" means too unrefined. Their conduct was difficult to emulate. They opposed the hearts of all under Heaven, being far from human sentiment. Though all under Heaven could not endure it, Mozi alone could—endurance, too, is endurance. Yet if only one can endure while all under Heaven cannot, what can be done? Having estranged the hearts of the people, it cannot serve as the Way to rule all under Heaven.

The great rivers between Heaven and Earth are called "famous rivers"; the tributaries were dredged by Yu. The *nang* was a vessel for carrying earth; the *si* was a tool for digging. The Nine Rivers were brought together, their functions harmonized to govern all the rivers under Heaven. Mozi’s doctrine held that Yu was a great sage who labored thus himself—how much more should others? "Raised heels" and "flat feet" are the same; "straw sandals" and "wooden clogs" are the same—wooden footwear is called *ji*, straw footwear *jue*. "Service" means use.

Xiangli was a surname; Qin was a given name, also a student of Mohism who became a teacher in the world. His disciples were all followers of the five feudal lords, indicating many studied under him. Ku Huo, Ji Chi, and Deng Lingzi were the names of three men. All three resided in the south, also studied the Mohist canon, yet their eccentricities surpassed even Mozi’s. Moreover, their doctrines all differed, so they named themselves "deviant Mohists," meaning separate branches of Mohism. "Not contrary" means not differing. Odd and even are inherently distinct, yet they claimed they did not conflict—this was forced sophistry. They used such contrarian rhetoric in their exchanges, hence it is said they "responded to one another." The *Juzi* was akin to the "foremost disciple," what Chan schools call a "Dharma heir." Among those who transmitted his teachings, they took the most accomplished as sages and made them their leaders. "Corpse" means leader. Hoping to become his successors, the *Juzi* transmitted it to their disciples as their posterity. "Posterity" still means descendants. "Unbroken" means uninterrupted, indicating its transmission continues to this day.

Tracing its origins, Mo Di’s intent was indeed noble, but his conduct was excessive, hence it is said, "his intent was sound, but his conduct was misguided." "Vying with one another" means emulating one another, for those who transmitted Mozi’s Way emulated self-affliction, desiring thereby to govern all under Heaven. Yet before governance could be seen, they first brought about disorder, hence it is said, "the height of disorder." Though Mozi’s goodness arose from the sincerity of his heart, there are no such people in the world today. "Seek in vain" means there are no longer such men.

"Unceasing" means unrelenting. Though they exhausted themselves to the point of emaciation, they never ceased their efforts—such men may indeed be called heroic scholars. "Scholars of talent" is a term for heroic figures. Mencius rejected Yang Zhu and Mo Di, and this text likewise mentions them together repeatedly. Yet when discussing the various schools by their doctrines, it omits the Yangists, for their teachings are deemed unworthy of inclusion.

Unburdened by convention, unadorned by externals, uncompromising toward others, unopposed to the multitude, they wished for the world’s peace to preserve all lives, seeking only that all—self and others—be fully provided for, and no more. In this they purified their hearts. Among the ancient arts of the Dao, some were found in this. Song Jian and Yin Wen, hearing of their example, were delighted. They fashioned the *Huashan* cap as their emblem, engaging all things by beginning with "distinguishing constraints," and called their teaching of the heart’s capacity "the conduct of the heart." They sought to harmonize and unite, to reconcile and pacify, proposing to establish this as their guiding principle.

They endured insult without shame, sought to end the people’s strife, forbid aggression, and halt warfare to save the age from conflict. With this, they traveled the world, persuading rulers above and instructing the people below. Though the world rejected them, they persisted stubbornly, unyielding in their advocacy—hence it is said, "both high and low grew weary of them, yet they forced themselves upon all."

"Unburdened by convention" means free from worldly entanglements. "Unadorned by externals" means not indulging in material things. "Unopposed to the multitude" means not defying human nature. Their wish was for all to live, seeing others as themselves, desiring only that each be sufficiently provided for. In this they centered their hearts and proclaimed it to the world—such was the teaching of Song Jian and Yin Wen.

*Huashan* is the name of their cap. "Distinguishing constraints" is akin to "being in ease." To "distinguish" is to abide by one’s lot, and to "be in ease" is to rest in spacious tranquility. "Beginning" means foundation. They engaged all things with this intent—"engaging" means drawing others in. "The heart’s capacity" refers to the heart’s inherent state. They expounded its nature to others, calling it "the conduct of the heart," for conduct is the heart’s function. This is akin to what the Buddhists call "the great function manifesting before one."

With the intent to harmonize, they sought to unite others in joy, to reconcile and unify all under Heaven, proposing to exalt Song Jian and Yin Wen as the leaders of their teaching. Seeing the people’s love of strife, they taught "enduring insult without shame" to save them. Seeing the age’s love of war, they taught forbidding aggression and halting warfare to save it. Above, they persuaded rulers; below, they instructed the common people. Though the world ignored them, they persisted stubbornly in their advocacy, boasting and expounding without cease. Both high and low grew weary of them, yet they forced themselves upon all—this saying must have been common at the time, hence it is repeated here to conclude.

Yet their concern for others was too great, and their care for themselves too little. They said: "Let us simply secure five *sheng* of rice—this will suffice." The master feared he would not be full, while the disciples, though hungry, never forgot the world, laboring day and night without rest, saying: "We must surely save lives!" How haughty were these would-be saviors of the world! Their concern for others was excessive, and their self-imposed suffering too great.

Their teaching held that each day, five *sheng* of rice would suffice for master and disciples to share. The master would still go hungry, so how could the disciples not? Thus, both master and disciples endured hunger to uphold their teaching. Yet they claimed: "We do not forget the world, laboring day and night without cease." They said: "Our self-imposed suffering is thus—how could this be a path to long life? But we do this to correct those who falsely claim to save the world while seeking their own gain." Hence it is said: "How haughty were these would-be saviors of the world!" "Haughty" means to correct. This is akin to Yu Rang’s words: "What I do is most difficult, to shame all those ministers who harbor divided loyalties." Li Bai’s poem *Drinking Alone, Sent to Wei Liu* contains the line: "I think of you wandering the world’s dust, haughty and self-mocking"—this is the same sense of "haughty."

They said: "The noble man does not engage in petty scrutiny, nor lend himself to things. If something is of no benefit to the world, clarifying it is not as good as abandoning it."

To take the prohibition of attack and the cessation of warfare as external matters, and the reduction of emotions and desires as internal ones—such are the distinctions between the great and the small, the refined and the coarse, and their practice extends no further than this.

Their teaching further states: "Do not engage in petty scrutiny, for petty scrutiny is contrary to the principle of *bie you* (distinguishing boundaries)." This means one should not insist on the distinction between self and other. "Not lending oneself to things" means that in all matters, one acts for oneself and does not rely on others for assistance. If something brings harm to the world and no benefit, even if one clearly knows it can be done, it is better to abandon it. Hence it is said: "Clarifying it is not as good as abandoning it."

The essence of their learning is this: externally, one should eliminate the conflicts of attack and warfare; internally, one should eliminate the turbulence of emotions and desires. *Gua qian* (reduction and restraint) refers to diminishing and curtailing emotions and desires. Though their learning varies in scale and refinement, the general thrust of their practice amounts to no more than this. *Shi* means "only."

Impartial yet not partisan, yielding yet without self-interest, resolute yet without fixed position, following things without duality, unburdened by deliberation, unguided by cunning—indiscriminate toward things, moving with them in unison: such were the ancient arts of the Way.

Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao heard of this teaching and delighted in it. They took the equalization of the myriad things as their guiding principle, saying: "Heaven can cover all things but cannot bear them; earth can bear all things but cannot cover them; the great Dao can encompass all things but cannot distinguish them. Knowing that all things have their *ke* (what is permissible) and their *bu ke* (what is not permissible), they said: 'Selection is never universal; teaching never reaches all; only the Dao leaves nothing behind.'"

Thus, Shen Dao abandoned knowledge and self, following only what could not be avoided. He let things flow naturally, taking this as the principle of the Dao, saying: "To know that one does not know is to approach the thinnest edge of knowledge—this is harmful." Xi Tan (or Xidan) said: "Without responsibility, he mocked the world’s esteem for worthies; unrestrained and unprincipled, he rejected the world’s great sages." Pushing and pulling, turning with things, he abandoned right and wrong, seeking only to avoid trouble. He did not rely on wisdom or planning, nor did he distinguish before or after. He was like a drifting gale, like a spinning feather, like a grinding stone’s rotation—whole yet without fault, moving or still without error, never incurring blame. Why? Because things without knowledge have no peril of self-assertion, no burden of cleverness. Moving or still, they do not depart from principle, and thus they pass their lives without praise. Hence it is said: "One reaches the state of things without knowledge, rendering worthies and sages useless."

A clod of earth does not lose the Dao. Yet the heroic laughed together, saying: "Shen Dao’s Way is not the conduct of the living but the principle of the dead—how bizarre!" Tian Pian was the same. He studied under Peng Meng and attained the teaching of "no instruction."

Peng Meng’s master said: "The ancient men of the Way reached the point of neither affirming nor denying anything." Their manner was abrupt and unyielding, difficult to describe. They often opposed others, avoided gatherings, and did not fall into the trap of rigid distinctions. What they called the Dao was not the Dao, and what they spoke of could not escape being wrong.

Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao did not understand the Dao. Nevertheless, in general, they had once glimpsed something of it.

"Not partisan" means also "without self-interest."

The *Yi* is level and smooth. *Jue* means to discard private intentions and have no partiality. "Following things" refers to the principles and tendencies of the myriad things. "Not two" means oneness. "Not turning to deliberation, not scheming with wisdom" means having no calculation. "Toward things, no selection"—no choosing—means the eye’s scope is even. "Going along with them" means following nature and acting. Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao were all recluses of Qi. Their teachings held that heaven and earth are also one among the myriad things, and if one calls them "one," then all are equal. Yet what leads them is the Way of non-action. Heaven can cover but cannot bear; earth can bear but cannot cover—this speaks of their partiality. The "Great Way" refers to the scholars of the Daoist school. They knew only to embrace all as one without distinction, a mode of discourse that existed in their time. "Each has what it affirms and what it denies" means each has its own partiality. If one selects among the myriad things, then one cannot be all-encompassing. To take this as a teaching is to fail to reach its ultimate. But if one returns to the Way, then nothing is left out. Hence it is said: "The Way leaves nothing behind." Selection entails affirmation and denial; to abandon knowledge, discard the self, and follow necessity—this is non-action. *Lingtai* means uninhibited. "Cool and unburdened toward things" means free from constraint. What they took as the principle of the Way was that things move without obstruction as the highest truth. Their teaching said: If one divides by knowledge and ignorance, one will be pressed by knowledge and come near to self-harm. *Bo* means pressing; *lin*, near. *Xikuo* describes something crooked and unstable. "No responsibility" means not fixing the mind on affairs. *Ren* means esteeming worthies to take up tasks. Since they did not engage in affairs, they laughed at the world’s esteem for worthies. The learning of the sage must uphold conduct, but since they were unrestrained and without conduct, they took the world’s scholars of sageliness as wrong. "Pushing and cutting off"—both mean having no sharp edges. "Turning with things" means having no sharp edges, no affirmation, no denial, with the aim of merely avoiding worldly entanglements. "Not taking knowledge and deliberation as a teacher" means having no thought. "Not knowing before and after" means no calculation. *Wei* (read as *wei*)—*weiran* means the sense of being towering and unmoving. "Pushed, then it moves; pulled, then it goes; pressed, then it responds"—this means rising only when compelled. "Wind returning, feather whirling, the path of a millstone"—all are metaphors for being without intent and turning with things. *Sui* means turning, revolving. They sought to preserve themselves by not being seen as wrong in the world, moving and resting in accord with nature without excess, thus avoiding offense to others. What was the basis of their learning? It was this: Only things without knowledge have no urgency for self-affirmation and no burden of concern. Moving and resting all follow the natural, so they do not depart from principle. Not seeking knowledge from human desires, they live their lives without praise. Precisely because they have no praise, they have no blame. Hence it is said: "They never incurred fault." Things without knowledge—such as wood, stone, tiles, and pebbles—are of this kind. "Establishing the self" means affirming the self and standing alone. Thus their teaching said: In living in the world, why use the names of sages and worthies? If one can be like a clod of earth, a thing without knowledge, then one does not lose the Way. Hence it is said: "The clod does not lose the Way." These words resemble those of the ascetics who practice austerities in remote mountains and valleys. Thus the heroic laughed at them, saying they were like dead men. "Strange indeed!" refers to Peng Meng and his followers being seen as odd by the world. "Received no instruction" means that in their early learning, they naturally resonated without needing teaching. Peng Meng was jealous of having a teacher, but his teacher’s words said: The ancients who possessed the Way took the absence of right and wrong as their foundation. *Huo ran*—the sound of wind—means their speech was like the rushing of wind. Without concern, though they spoke, what was there to hold in their words? Hence it is said: "How could one speak of it?" Their views were always contrary to the world, unable to gather and observe with others, thus becoming a one-sided teaching. "Not exempt from"—they merely sought to have no sharp edges. *Yuanduan* means having no sharp edges. Though their words were grand, what they called the Way was not the Way, so they were not exempt from the world’s ridicule. *Wei* is the same as *wei*. Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao did not understand the Way—this is Zhuangzi’s concluding judgment. "In general"—viewing them broadly, they had all heard something of this Way, but did not grasp its true essence. Such closing lines reveal his literary style.

The root is taken as essence, things as coarse; accumulation is seen as insufficient. Serene and alone, they dwelled with the spirit-like clarity—this was one of the ancient arts of the Way. Guan Yin and Lao Dan heard of their teachings and delighted in them. They established them on the constant of "nothingness and being," centered them on the Great One. They took gentleness, weakness, humility, and yielding as their outward form, and emptiness, non-destruction of the myriad things as their substance. Guan Yin said: "Abiding nowhere in the self, the forms of things manifest on their own. In movement, they are like water; in stillness, like a mirror; in response, like an echo. Fleeting as if vanished, silent as if pure. Those who are the same are in harmony; those who grasp lose. They never precede others but always follow." Lao Dan said: "Know the masculine, keep to the feminine, and be the world’s valley. Know the white, keep to the disgraceful, and be the world’s lowland. When others all seek to be first, I alone seek to be last, saying: I receive the world’s filth. When others all seek the substantial, I alone seek the empty. Having no store, thus I have surplus."

Abiding thus, it stands towering and ever-abundant. In conducting oneself, it is unhurried yet without waste, effortless yet mocking all contrivance. While others seek fortune, I alone seek the preservation of wholeness through bending, saying: "Merely to avoid blame." Taking depth as the root, restraint as the guiding principle, I say: "What is hard will shatter; what is sharp will break." Ever tolerant toward things, never carving away at others—this may be called the ultimate attainment.

Ah, Guan Yin and Lao Dan—were they not the great perfected of antiquity? The root is the Dao; things are the ten thousand affairs. Those who regard accumulation as insufficiency speak of treasuring wealth for all under heaven. Dwelling with the numinous and luminous is to guard the natural. That Guan Yin was a disciple of Lao Dan—this merely means that the disciple came first and the master later, a fleeting stroke of the brush. Taking nothingness as the essence, the inception of the Great Ultimate as the ruler—establishing this, too, is to rule.

"Gentle, weak, humble, and yielding" express the meaning of "the soft tongue endures." As outward form, this describes how one engages the world and interacts with things as seen externally. In emptiness, all things are preserved whole; thus it is said: "Taking emptiness and non-destruction of the myriad things as substance." Substance is the true principle. As Le Xuan said: "Where nothing exists, all things are complete."

"Abiding nowhere in the self" means having no private agenda. "The forms of things manifest on their own" means that the appearances of things arise naturally as they are. The movement of water, the stillness of a mirror, the response of an empty valley—all are without intent. "Fleeting as if vanished" describes the indistinct presence of something that seems both there and not there. "Silent as if pure" means that purity is not seen as purity. Harmony comes from being the same as things; to grasp is to lose. "Never preceding others but always following" means acting only when pressed, rising only when unavoidable.

"Know the masculine, keep to the feminine"—this is to conceal ability within inability. "Know the white, keep to the disgraceful"—this is to remain lowly while knowing one’s worth. Valleys and lowlands lie below yet contain all things; to be a valley or lowland is to embody the greatness of receptivity. "When others all seek to be first, I alone seek to be last"—this is the same as never preceding others but always following. "Receiving the world’s filth" is to know purity yet guard disgrace. Not taking the substantial for emptiness, nor emptiness for substance, thus when others all seek the substantial, I alone seek the empty. "Having no store, thus I have surplus"—this is the same as regarding accumulation as insufficiency. Only by taking emptiness as substance does one remain towering and ever-abundant, for where nothing is stored, all things are complete.

"Unhurried" means at ease. "Without waste" means without loss. While others prize skill, I find skill in non-action, thus I mock their contrivance. While others seek fortune, I seek fortune in the absence of misfortune. "Preservation of wholeness through bending" means that by yielding, one preserves oneself. "Merely to avoid blame"—there is no greater fortune than the absence of misfortune. "Taking depth as the root" means that the foundation lies in the inception of the Great Ultimate. "Taking restraint as the guiding principle" means that the utmost simplicity and frugality are the methods of preserving oneself. "Guiding principle" means method. All things that are hard or sharp will break or be blunted—this is what is meant by "teeth, being hard, will shatter."

Taking the capacity to contain all things as one’s measure, nothing can diminish one. "Never carving away at others" means preserving one’s own life alone. "This may be called the ultimate attainment"—this is the ultimate Dao under heaven. To call them "great perfected" is an expression of reverence.

Vast and formless, ever-changing and constant, death and life as one, coextensive with heaven and earth, moving with the numinous and luminous—where does it go? Where does it wander? All things are encompassed, yet none can be its refuge. Among the arts of the Dao in antiquity, some were like this. Zhuang Zhou heard of their teachings and delighted in them, expounding with absurd and boundless words, wild and unbounded speech, limitless and unconstrained phrases, at times unrestrained yet never partial, never showing bias in his views.

He saw the world as sunk in turbidity, unfit for solemn discourse, so he used "goblet words" to ramble, "weighty words" as truth, and "parables" to broaden his meaning. Alone he roamed with the spirit of heaven and earth, yet never looked down upon the ten thousand things, never reproached right or wrong, and lived among the common world. Though his writings were intricate and marvelous, they flowed without harm; though his words were uneven and strange, they were profound and worth contemplating. His fullness could not be exhausted. Above, he wandered with the Creator; below, he befriended those beyond death and life, without beginning or end.

In regard to the root, his teachings were vast and expansive, profound and unbridled. In regard to the essence, they may be called well-tempered and supremely attained. Yet in responding to transformation and dissolving things, his principles were inexhaustible, his arrival unchanging. Vague and obscure, their depths remain unfathomed.

Vast and formless—this is nothingness. Ever-changing and constant—this is to take non-unity as unity. Death and life as one—this is to be ignorant of life and death. From this single phrase, one knows that the learning of the Śākya has long been present. "Coextensive with heaven and earth"—this is to be of the same body as heaven and earth. "Moving with the numinous and luminous"—this is to move in harmony with creation. "Where does it go? Where does it wander?"—this is to act without trace. "All things are encompassed"—this is to fully realize the principles of the ten thousand things. "None can be its refuge"—this means that none can know its ultimate destination.

"Absurd and boundless" means distant and unfathomable. "Wild and unbounded" means vast and limitless. "Limitless and unconstrained" means without beginning or end. "At times unrestrained yet never partial"—his teachings were free yet without faction. "Partial" means partisan. "Never showing bias in his views"—his insights were not confined to one aspect. "Bias" means singularity.

He saw the people of the world as foolish and sunk in turbidity, unable to be enlightened by sincere and earnest speech. "Solemn discourse" means dignified and truthful speech.

Spreading and unfolding—this means boundless. "To be true" means to invoke the weight of antiquity, first desiring others to regard it as real. "To be vast" means to lodge meaning in words that are broad and unrestrained. To commune with the spirit of Heaven and Earth, to befriend the natural workings of creation—this is to be a true companion. "Not scorning the ten thousand things" means not using this to scorn the world. Yet Zhuangzi’s intent was precisely to scorn this world, and thus he spoke in such contrary terms.

"Not reproving right and wrong" means that right and wrong are not clung to. Only when there is no right and no wrong can one dwell among the common customs of the age. "Magnificent and grand"—this means lofty and majestic. "Interwoven and harmonious"—this conveys the meaning of blending and merging as one. "No harm"—this means no mockery of others. "Uneven and irregular"—sometimes this, sometimes that; sometimes suppressed, sometimes exalted—it cannot be fixed. "Playful and cunning"—this means witty, slippery, and elusive. These two lines reveal the intent behind his writing: though his words may seem strange and absurd, they are worthy of contemplation. Once these two lines are understood, one can read Zhuangzi.

"That which is replete and cannot be restrained"—this means that within his book, principles fill every space, making it a work the world cannot do without. "Root" means the fundamental teaching. The root and teaching of his book are nothing other than the vast, profound, and harmonious Dao. "Opening wide"—this means expansive. "Unfettered"—this means freely released. "Ascending to fulfillment"—this means it can ascend to the principles of Heaven. Though his words are all of non-action and naturalness, when applied to the world, they respond to transformation and resolve the principles of things—meaning they can civilize customs and clarify principles.

"Its principles are inexhaustible"—this means their use is never depleted. "Not shedding"—this means his words arise from the Dao and do not depart from it. "Vast and obscure"—this describes the profound depth of his book. "Not yet fully expressed"—this means that what he attained in his heart cannot be fully conveyed in words.

From the beginning onward, he distinguishes five teachings and places himself last, following Laozi, explicitly stating that his learning derives from Laozi. The first three sections each begin with "though," all making definitive statements about the validity of his learning. Only Laozi is free of such judgments. Here, he again uses "though," saying his learning is not without use in the world. This is where the text shifts, displaying its highest literary skill—it must be read with great care.

Hui Shi was versatile in many arts; his writings filled five carts. Yet his Dao was contradictory and flawed, and his words did not hit the mark. His "intent in surveying things" states: "That which is supremely great has no outside—this is called the Great One. That which is supremely small has no inside—this is called the Small One. Without thickness, it cannot accumulate, yet its greatness spans a thousand *li*. Heaven and Earth are low; mountains and marshes are level. The sun is just at its zenith yet already slanting; things are just born yet already dying. Great sameness differs from small sameness—this is called the small sameness and difference. The ten thousand things are entirely the same and entirely different—this is called the great sameness and difference."

Mo Di, Song Xing, Peng, Tian, and Shen Dao were all partial in their grasp of the Dao, but Hui Shi merely delighted in debate and thus did not partake in the true arts. His mention in the "Lineage of Those Who Have Heard the Wind" appears only at the end of the chapter. "His writings filled five carts"—this means his books, though numerous, could not be contained even by five carts. Yet despite their volume, his learning was not correct, and his words were not apt, hence the criticism of their contradictions and inaccuracy.

"Intent in surveying things"—this means examining one by one the ideas he discussed regarding things. "Supremely great has no outside"—this refers to the great void. "Supremely small has no inside"—this refers to things like the tip of an autumn hair. These eight characters align with what Zhuangzi said, but by calling them the Great One and Small One, he introduces the beginning of disputation. If one speaks of "the One," there is no great or small; yet within the One, he distinguishes great and small—this is sameness within difference and difference within sameness.

"Without thickness"—this means supremely thin. "Cannot accumulate"—for if it accumulates, it becomes thick. Accumulate without cease, and its greatness can reach a thousand *li*. Thus, he speaks of great and small as the same: the vastness of a thousand *li* is merely the accumulation of that which has no thickness. Though Heaven is high and Earth spread low, when Heaven’s *qi* descends, it too becomes low—hence "Heaven and Earth are low." Though mountains are higher than marshes, the *qi* of marshes can reach mountains, so "mountains and marshes are level."

"Slanting"—this means looking sideways. When the sun is at its zenith, if one looks at it sideways, it is no longer at the center. Thus, "just at its zenith yet already slanting." Things are just born, yet their seeds must have come from what died before—hence "just born yet already dying." To speak of great and small is to speak of small sameness and difference. To unite the ten thousand things in sameness and difference is to speak of great sameness and difference. Though one may call it great, it does not transcend the accumulation of small things; though one may call it small, when combined, it can become great—thus there is neither sameness nor difference.

"The south has no limit yet has a limit. Today I go to Yue, yet I came yesterday. Linked rings can be unlinked. I know the center of the world—it is north of Yan and south of Yue. Embracing all things with universal love—Heaven and Earth are one body." Hui Shi regarded these as grand insights into the world, and those skilled in debate among the world’s debaters delighted in them.

"The south"—this refers to the sea. Though it is boundless, to call it a "direction" implies it must have a limit. This is true of all four directions, but he speaks only of the south not merely to illustrate one and imply the other three, but because Heaven leans to the northwest and the sea lies only in the south, while the other three directions in the north are distant—hence he speaks of it specifically.

"Today I go to Yue, yet I came yesterday"—though my feet have not yet reached Yue, knowing of Yue’s name and having come later, today’s departure can also be called yesterday’s arrival. Two rings linked together cannot be unlinked, yet each ring is itself a circle and cannot adhere to the other. If they do not adhere, they are not truly linked rings.

"Embracing all things with universal love—Heaven and Earth are one body"—this is the teaching of Mo Di. Hui Shi took this as a grand vision of the world, and those skilled in debate among the world’s debaters rejoiced in it.

In the north lies Yan, in the south Yue—neither is the center of the world. Yet the people of Yan know only Yan, and the people of Yue know only Yue. At the world’s beginning, neither knew of the other, each taking their own land as the center of Heaven and Earth.

All things form one body with Heaven and Earth, so though Heaven and Earth are vast, they are but one thing among the ten thousand things. How then can there be great or small? They are of one body.

The grand vision claims this as uniquely lofty above all under Heaven, and thus its doctrine is taught to those who study debate. Once the world’s scholars rejoiced in it together, its influence spread ever wider, giving rise to the following arguments:

Eggs have hair.
A chicken has three feet.
Ying possesses all under Heaven.
A dog can be a sheep.
A horse lays eggs.
A tadpole has a tail.
Fire is not hot.
Mountains speak.
Wheels do not touch the ground.
Eyes do not see.
Fingers do not reach, yet what reaches is not continuous.
A tortoise is longer than a snake.
A carpenter’s square is not square; a compass cannot draw a circle.
A chisel does not fit its socket.
The shadow of a flying bird never moves.
An arrow in flight has a moment of neither motion nor stillness.
A dog is not a hound.
A yellow horse and a black ox make three.

A white dog is black. A solitary colt has never had a mother. A one-foot staff, halved each day, will never be exhausted for ten thousand generations. Debaters used these arguments to engage with Hui Shi, exhausting themselves without end.

Huan Tuan and Gongsun Long, disciples of the debaters, adorned men’s minds and altered their intentions. They could overcome others in speech but could not win over their hearts—such was the confinement of the debaters. Hui Shi daily wielded his knowledge to contend with others, uniquely crafting monstrosities with the world’s debaters; this was his foundation.

Yet Hui Shi, in his oral disputations, deemed himself the most worthy, declaring, “How grand are Heaven and Earth!” Though he maintained a bold stance, he lacked true method.

As for the claim that eggs have hair: though the hair within an egg is not yet visible, the feathers of sparrows and chickens differ. For instance, if a chicken were to brood a duck’s egg, what emerges would bear duck feathers, not chicken feathers—thus, eggs have hair.

A chicken, by nature, has two feet, but there must be something that moves and propels it—hence, three.

That Ying possesses all under Heaven: the capital of Chu was at Ying, where its ruler declared himself king, no different from one who has gained the world.

That a dog can be a sheep: the names “dog” and “sheep” arise from human convention, not from the things themselves. Had the first beings called a dog a sheep, people today would likewise regard it as a sheep; had they called a sheep a dog, people today would regard it as a dog.

That a horse lays eggs: though live birth differs from egg-laying, the terms “womb-born” and “egg-born” are human constructs. If one may call a womb an egg, then the same logic applies to dogs and sheep.

Dingzi refers to the toad or frog; in Chu, it is called *dingzi*. Though the toad has no tail, it begins as a tadpole, which does have a tail—thus, one may say the toad has a tail.

That fire is not hot: heat and cold are also human designations. Moreover, there are fire-dwelling rats and fire-washed cloth. If rats can enter and exit fire, and fire can wash cloth, then it is not hot.

That mountains speak: empty valleys transmit sound; when one calls out, an echo answers—is this not the mountain having a mouth?

That wheels do not touch the ground: when a wheel rolls upon the earth, it is a wheel, but the moment it touches the ground, it cannot turn—thus, one may say wheels do not tread the earth.

That eyes do not see: only after the eye sees can the finger reach. Yet the eye cannot reach what the finger cannot see—thus, what reaches is neither separable from nor continuous with the eye and finger.

That a tortoise is longer than a snake: if a tortoise were as long as a snake, it would no longer be called a tortoise. Since it is called a tortoise, its length is naturally thus—one may also say it is longer than a snake.

That a carpenter’s square is not square, and a compass cannot draw a circle: once called a square, it cannot also be called square; once called a compass, it cannot also be called round.

That a chisel does not fit its socket: though the tenon rests within the mortise, its rotation cannot be restrained by the mortise—thus, one may say it does not fit, or that the fit is imperfect.

That the shadow of a flying bird never moves: once the bird takes flight, the shadow follows it away. One may speak of the bird’s flight, but not of the shadow’s movement.

That an arrow in flight has a moment of neither motion nor stillness: when the arrow is on the bowstring, it is at rest; when it strikes the target, it is in motion. Between leaving the string and reaching the target, there is a moment of neither motion nor stillness.

That a dog is not a hound: dog and hound are the same thing. If called a dog, it cannot be called a hound; if called a hound, it cannot be called a dog—thus, a dog is not a hound.

That a yellow horse and a black ox make three: horse and ox are two bodies; yellow and black are two colors. To speak of two bodies alongside two colors is to make three.

That a yellow horse and a black ox make three: yellow and black are two colors; horse and ox are two bodies. When two colors attach to two bodies, they become three.

That a white dog is black: the names “black” and “white” do not arise from the original nature of things. Thus, one may also call white black.

That a solitary colt has never had a mother: to name it “solitary” is to deny it ever had a mother; one cannot say it is solitary yet once had a mother.

A one-foot staff, broken in half each day: today one uses this half, tomorrow that half. Though divided endlessly, it will never be exhausted for ten thousand generations.

All the above arguments were learned from Master Hui, expanding his doctrines to engage with him. Throughout their lives, they ceaselessly debated—such were Huan Tuan, Gongsun Long, and their ilk.

To adorn men’s minds is to obscure them; to alter their intentions is to confuse them. In a moment’s debate, though one may silence another in speech, the other’s heart remains unconvinced. The debaters, lost in their own labyrinth, do not perceive this—thus, it is called their *enclosure*.

Hui Shi daily wielded his knowledge to contend with others, relying on his cleverness to overpower them in debate. Alone, he and his followers became objects of astonishment—yet this was the extent of his ability, and thus it is called his *foundation*. *Foundation* means root.

He prided himself on his rhetorical skill, deeming his grandeur equal to Heaven and Earth. Though he maintained a bold stance, he was truly devoid of learning and method.

In the south there was a man named Huang Liao who asked why Heaven and Earth do not collapse or sink, and the causes of wind, rain, thunder, and lightning. Hui Shi did not decline but answered without hesitation, discoursing on the myriad things without pause. Though his words were many, he deemed them few and added ever more monstrosities.

He took contrarianism as truth and sought to prevail over others in reputation, which is why he never fit in with the crowd. Weak in virtue yet strong in disputation, his path grew ever more obscure.

Viewing Hui Shi’s abilities through the Dao of Heaven and Earth, he was no more than a mosquito or gadfly’s labor—what use was he to the world? To fill one vessel is possible; to exalt the Dao further is near perfection. Yet Hui Shi could not find peace in this. Scattered among the myriad things, never satisfied, he ultimately gained fame as a master of debate.

Alas for Hui Shi’s talent—so unbounded yet unfulfilled, chasing the myriad things without return! He exhausted echoes for sound, while form and shadow raced in vain. How lamentable!

Those who lean upon others are men of strange divergence. In the south there was a solitary lofty man named Huang Liao, who questioned Hui Shi: “Why does Heaven not fall? Why does Earth not sink? Who truly brings forth wind, rain, thunder, and lightning?” These are the marvels of Creation—how could words contain them? Yet Hui Shi did not decline but answered without hesitation, responding without deliberation, discoursing on the ten thousand things in endless variety. The myriad things are manifold indeed. Though his words were many, he deemed them few and added ever more monstrosities. Taking contrarianism as truth, he sought to prevail over others through eloquence, crafting a reputation for himself—thus he never harmonized with the world. *Not fitting* means not finding accord. Within, he had no true attainment, hence “weak in virtue.” Outwardly, he forced disputation, hence “strong in things.” *Ào* means dark and secluded; his path was neither bright nor upright but obscure and crooked.

Viewing Hui Shi’s abilities through the Dao of Heaven and Earth, he was no more than a mosquito or gadfly’s labor. What use was he to the world of men? To fill one vessel is possible; to deem this superior to exalting the Dao is perilous. *Yù* means to surpass; *jī* means peril. Unable to find peace within himself, he scattered his efforts among the myriad things, never satisfied, ultimately knowing not the Dao but gaining fame as a master of debate. *Zú* means in the end.

Hui Shi was indeed a man of talent, yet his dissipation brought no attainment, and his pursuit of externals left him without return—how regrettable! *Dài* means dissipation. Echo arises from sound, sound being the root and echo the branch; to exhaust echoes for sound is to forget the root. Shadow arises from form, form being the root and shadow the branch; to seek rest for the shadow without stopping the form is to race with it—another parable of forgetting the root.

This concludes the *Zhuangzi*, ending with Hui Shi. Though he did not stand among those who grasped the Dao, his words as a debater were ever turning nothing into something, and his speech was indeed extraordinary—thus he fittingly closes this chapter. For though this work differs from composition, it too has its own structure, with deliberate openings and endings. Like the *Spring and Autumn Annals*’ final brushstroke at the capture of the qilin, or the *Doctrine of the Mean*’s “Heaven’s charge is soundless, scentless,” this book’s Inner Chapters—with “Hundun’s seven orifices”—all follow a single pattern, which must not be overlooked.

Those who explain the classics in terms of literary technique may not grasp the principle; those who grasp the principle may overlook the literary art. Thus their readings lack vitality, and their interpretations lack savor. Only Master Aixuan, whose Dao was lofty and whose prose was exquisitely refined, gave the Six Classics an interpretation that stands apart through the ages. Alas, after Wangshan and Lexuan, his learning was not transmitted, and no one today knows of it.

The *Book of Southern Florescence* is a marvel of brushwork across past and present. Yet those who revere it may drift into hollow emptiness, while those who mock it may doubt its strangeness and extravagance. Though its literary brilliance cannot be erased, its annotations have long remained obscure, a lasting burden upon the text.

In my youth, I served Master Chen Lexuan, hearing fragments of his discourse. I came to admire the text but could not fully grasp its passages. Later, I traveled and studied with Zhuxi, often taking it up to read together. I delighted in its lucid dissections, though its divergences from common understanding were many. The more I read, the deeper my admiration grew.

After passing the imperial examinations and returning south, I lived in leisure for a long while. I devoted myself to the study of the classics, and with this book, the more I read, the more I loved it—and the more I doubted it. For this book is difficult to comprehend: its words often differ from our own, its arguments sometimes contradict the ancient sages, and its purport resists inquiry—like grasping at shadows in midair or seizing a horned dragon with bare hands. Its unifying principle eludes certainty, like tracing the three rivers to their hidden tributaries or following the nine streams to their lost courses.

Each time I opened the scroll, I could not help but leap with joy, nor could I avoid sinking into confusion. In the year *wuwu*, I visited Zhuxi by the stream, and in conversation, he suddenly said to me: "I once wished to cleanse Master Nanhua’s old immortal of Guo Xiang’s vulgarities, but with each meal and every shift of circumstance, I never found the time to shut my door and write. Since misfortune and setbacks have forced me into retirement, I have turned to this work to ease my cares and amuse my old age. Now, at last, the book is complete."

Overjoyed, I sought it out. Upon returning, I read it eagerly and saw how it divided and analyzed, branched and dissected, with no empty phrases in its chapters, no superfluous words in its lines. It unfolded with boundless freedom, stirring and transforming like a dance without end. Yet every word and phrase had its place, as if waking from a dream to find clarity, or being freed from bonds to gain release.

Only then did I understand that this book stands as a school unto itself, unbound by conventional meanings. Though it roams the profound and obscure, it does not neglect worldly affairs. It does not fail to recognize the worth of sages and worthies but disdains mere conformity. It does not ignore the excesses of cunning and deceit but champions defiance of the vulgar. Whether in ancient or modern times, those who recite it may differ, but all have merely glimpsed its fence without reaching its inner sanctum.

Since assuming my post in this humble district, though official documents pile high and my days are constrained, in the quiet of early dawn before the clerks assemble, I must light a lamp and chant its verses—sometimes finishing a single chapter, sometimes an entire scroll—dancing with hands and feet, as if meeting the author in person.

Thus I declare: the *Book of Southern Florescence* is indispensable to this world, and Zhuxi’s exegesis is indispensable to *Southern Florescence*. For Zhuxi’s learning derives from Lexuan, Lexuan’s from Wangshan, and Wangshan’s from old Master Aixuan, transmitted through three generations without deviation. Zhuxi not only mastered his teacher’s transmission but also scoured the Buddhist and Daoist texts beyond the Six Classics, the Masters, and the Histories. Thus he was able to fathom the hidden subtleties of this old master and exhaust his ingenious insights. If *Southern Florescence* were to return to life, he would surely be its confidant.

Now, those who read this book may do so without regret. Though our district is remote, my devotion to it runs deep, and I wished to spread its transmission. By economizing on furs and provisions, I have fortunately brought the project to completion. Here I record why I love it, how I came to understand it, and the joy it has brought me.

Zhuxi of the Lin family, styled Suweng, once held office as a literary official. Now he serves as *Baomo* Director of the Jade Bureau Abbey. *Yanzhai* is the name of his study. His prose often resembles that of Zhuangzi. This book is titled *Oral Exegesis* because it does not strive for literary polish but freely mixes the colloquial with direct exposition.

In the first year of the Jingding era, during the Zhonghe Festival, Lin Jingde, *Xuanjiao Lang* and Magistrate of Jianning County in Shaowu Prefecture, composed this preface.

Zhuangzi’s prose soars with heroic grandeur, traversing all things in spirit and roaming beyond the cosmos in mind—his joy and insight unmatched by any in antiquity. His words surge and transform, eclipsing sun and moon, cleaving through clouds and rivers, at once subtle and flowing, resplendent as scales and feathers, vast as heaven and sea. Though lavish, they never entangle; though bold, they never overreach—truly the most towering literary achievement under heaven.

Yanzhai’s exegesis of this work is like the soaking immersion of rivers and seas, the nourishing moisture of fertile rains. He enters Zhuangzi’s emotions as his own, follows his thoughts as his own, dreams his dreams and awakens to his awakenings. Thus, he speaks Zhuangzi’s words and points to his pointers, bringing forth voice, laughter, and presence as if in person—so that readers encounter him face to face. How could this be achieved by mere luck or effort?

Yanzhai’s learning is profound, his discernment peerless; his roots run deep, his practice refined. In the realm of his awakening, no height is too lofty to brush against; in stillness and depth, his insight ascends effortlessly. I observe Yanzhai: his bearing is noble, his form and function harmonious with heaven and earth, his spirit full and luminous, stretching forth with self-assured majesty—is he not like the *kun* and *peng*? Yet he has also steeped himself in this text, and who but Yanzhai could grasp its words as he does?

Now, Yanzhai’s work stands resolute, reviving Zhuangzi from dry bones and unlocking a treasure trove of millennia. Is Yanzhai not himself a figure of great magnanimity, a heroic and towering scholar? When I first obtained this text, I read it with astonishment, recording my marvel at the end to pass down to my descendants—not that I dare claim to fully comprehend Yanzhai’s exegesis.

When the Old Immortal of Qiyuan composed this work, his vision of the Dao was precise, his indignation at the world keen. Only his reclusive and untrammeled ways allowed him to express it, and only his extraordinary vigor allowed him to unfold it—venturing into boundless obscurity, stirring transformations beyond measure. One may trust the reach of his eye and the force of his brush. Yet he did not know when he overstepped, when he verged on the extravagant. Did he ever intend, at the outset, to leave this for posterity or establish a teaching? Or to exalt Laozi while suppressing the Confucians? Why, then, do readers fail to perceive this? Some dismiss it as mere "emptiness and nothingness," others condemn it as "heterodoxy." They see its transcendent vision, hear its world-shaking words, yet often stumble over incomplete sentences or unclear characters, resorting to doubt, omission, or excuses. Did Zhuangzi ever wish for such treatment from later generations?

Master Yanzhai of the Jade Bureau, Lord Lin, received the Dao of the Sage from Lexuan. Lexuan’s relation to Zhuangzi is like that of Ziyun to later ages; Yanzhai’s to Lexuan, like Houba to the *Great Mystery*. Thus, he emerged to compose this work—organizing its chapters, parsing its sentences, clarifying its characters—so that no chapter lacks explanation, no sentence lacks resolution, no character lacks illumination. What was once empty is now solid, what was divergent now unified, what was doubtful now certain, what was fragmented now complete. Only after thousands of years does the *Nanhua Jing* become a whole book in the world. Not only will the Old Immortal leap for joy above the ninefold heavens, but Lexuan, too, will surely dance with hands and feet between the seen and unseen.

Some ask: If one applies philological scholarship to a text on life and destiny—like Master Zhu’s "culmination of all learning," which offers exegesis from the *Book of Changes* to the *Songs of Chu*, yet leaves Zhuangzi’s work untouched—is this not a flaw? I reply: Does not Han Yu’s saying hold—"from the ancient *Ya* and *Song* to Zhuangzi and Qu Yuan"? And did not Master Zhu himself say, "The scholars of the Jin and Song did not fully grasp Zhuangzi’s truth"? If not, is there still more to uncover, or was this left for a reason yet to come? Yanzhai’s achievement may well stand no lower than Master Zhu’s.

I fear that later scholars, forgetting past difficulties and delighting in present ease, may grow complacent. Thus, I reiterate these words.
