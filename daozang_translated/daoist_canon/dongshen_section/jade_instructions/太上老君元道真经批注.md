# 太上老君元道真经批注

**The Supreme Lord Lao’s *Original Dao True Scripture* with Commentary**
*Commentary by Hermit Hidden Mushroom of the Luminous Union*

**Title Explanation:**
*Original* (元) signifies the root, the beginning. *Dao* (道) refers to the Supreme True One’s Dao. *Scripture* (经) means the path, the primal truth of the origin. This scripture is most wondrous, hence called the *True Scripture*.

---

### **The Original Dao, Upper Scroll**
The *Original Dao* is the supreme Dao of Lord Lao. *Supreme* (元上) denotes the unfathomably lofty, the highest source, thus called *supreme*.

Lord Lao said: The Dao has three levels—upper, middle, and lower. These correspond to the three cinnabar fields: upper, middle, and lower. Thus, above lies the *Mud Pill Palace*, in the center the *Crimson City*, and below the *Boiling Sea*—hence the three. The *Yellow Court* Dao also has upper, middle, and lower.

The *Immortals’ Scripture* states: "One even, one odd—this is harmony. Taste not twice, pair not twice." All Daos have three levels, each with its sequence. The term *all Daos* refers to the myriad paths. Thus, methods have many gates, all for refining the elixir to completion. Some ride carp to ascend to heaven, some mount dragons to reach the Han, some perform rites to face the origin, some swallow qi to attain longevity, or trace the current to extend life.

The *Immortals’ Scripture* says: "The Dao has ten thousand methods, all leading to longevity. Water has a thousand sources, all flowing to the Eastern Sea—all achieve longevity." Comparing Lord Lao’s middle Dao to the *Yellow Court*’s upper Dao, among these three scriptures, the highest is the *Original Dao*. This Dao is supremely lofty, empty and primal, subtle and wondrous, serene and formless, moving in accord with nature—thus scholars find it difficult to glimpse.

The highest is the foremost of all scriptures; the most wondrous is the gateway to all methods. Only those of superior capacity who suddenly awaken on their own may study it. Thus, scholars with deep karmic affinity for the Dao, their resolve firm as iron and stone, aided by hidden merit and perfected by immortal qi, achieve the Dao and return to heaven. Those who fear death and cling to life cannot study it. Only those who cast aside ill-gotten wealth as they would an enemy, and shun seductive beauty as they would a foe, may harmonize with the Dao.

Many admire and practice the middle Dao, but it is difficult to align with this Dao, so it has not descended for long. Those who chase the false while seeking the true, though they grasp principles, struggle to succeed—this is misalignment. Yet if those of superior capacity practice it with singular resolve, they naturally attain the primal measure. This refers to those of shallow learning and inferior capacity; only the resolute, who cherish life and detest death, are called *superior capacity*.

Mastering the *Book of Changes* and the primal measure is no easy task—it emerges from the vast. Moreover, all Daos have masters to serve, and their transgressions and punishments vary. Only this Dao has no transgressions or punishments, hence no master to serve.

The *Inner Teaching Scripture* states: "Act without acting, think without thinking, move without moving." These three intermingle truth and falsehood, teaching crooked and straight alike, thus incurring transgressions and punishments. Lesser Daos require secluded mountains and forests to practice. Ancient sages blended with the mundane world, neither fitting nor unfit; middling scholars hid in mountains and forests, fitting yet not fitting. Thus, the *Original Dao* differs from other Daos in practice, offering swift methods, free from harm or setbacks. Its prohibitions and admonitions against heterodoxy prevent illness and stillness. This Dao aligns with the *Double Mystery*, hence it suffers no harm. Otherwise, harm would arise.

The *Immortals’ Scripture* says: "Lesser Daos are easily deluded; middling practitioners are easily corrupted." Laozi said: "Not seeing what may be desired keeps the mind undisturbed." Only this Dao can be perfected in the mundane world.

The *Immortals’ Scripture* states: "The supreme Dao acts without acting, harms yet does not harm, its principle utterly natural, ails yet does not ail." Laozi said: "Harmonize its light, blend with the dust—profound and abiding." Thus, it suffers no harm.

Drawing in through the nose and expelling through the mouth can dispel cold and heat. Laozi said: "The gate of the Mysterious Female is the root of life and death, subtly enduring." Mastering this principle ensures enduring as heaven and earth, untouched by cold or heat. Thus, exhaling clears the heart, which accumulates no poisons, hence no cold or heat. It can also dispel stagnant primal qi.

Dispelling stagnation means entering subtlety from excess, refining it gradually—then the Dao descends naturally. If one hastily seeks results, it backfires and yields no merit—hence *dispelling stagnation*. *Primal qi* is the qi of nature, arising from the obscure, descending from the empty and primal. The awakened use it without using, thus it is called *primal qi*.

Holding the breath can relieve hunger and weakness, unblock the hundred passages, and cure all illnesses—not by cultivating qi to restore the origin. Swallowing qi can relieve deficiency and frailty—not by naturally filling oneself. Thus, superior practitioners of the true refine subtlety within subtlety, acting without acting, focusing on one Dao, awakening to mystery within mystery, never losing the *Original Dao*.

The *Immortals’ Scripture* says: "Forcing breath by puffing the cheeks and swallowing is the path to seeking death; holding the breath to exhaustion is the root of harming the spirit." Those who study the Dao must avoid this. Circulating qi can moisten the skin—this is no ordinary Dao. Those who attain their will have primal qi abundant and subtle, their skin moist and radiant.

"Clouds move, rain falls—all things flourish." Qi fills the hundred vessels—all spirits are numinous.

The *Immortals’ Scripture* states: "Not a single hair fails to connect with qi; not a single joint fails to house the spirit." This Dao returns to the root and restores the origin, uniting with spontaneity—thus it is called the *Original Dao*. Laozi said: "The teeming things all return to their root. Returning to the root is called quiescence; quiescence is called restoring the mandate." In the great subtleties of practice, one must comprehend the Three-in-One. If it does not fill itself, yet one acts as if forgetting, one will eventually awaken on their own. If one cannot return to simplicity and restore the root, this is to lose the principle of the *Original Dao*.

Those who achieve cultivation strengthen the sinews and replenish the marrow, secure the five viscera, clear and benefit the Mud Pill Palace, and pacify the Cinnabar Terrace. When one attains the Dao, the sinews and bones transform naturally, reverting to youth and returning to childhood. The *Central Yellow Scripture* says: "The skin is white as frost, the sinews and bones green; the underworld removes their register, and heaven records their name. Seated, they inspect the netherworld and command ghosts and spirits." Attaining the *Original* without dissipation of essence, serene and natural, heaven and earth protect and guard them. Poisonous creatures do not move, and all illnesses do not arise. The *Yellow Court Scripture* states: "Bones green, sinews red, the body like frost; the seven apertures dispel misfortune, and one attains eternal peace."

That the six do not recklessly enter and the three do not recklessly exit—this is the Dao. In the great subtleties of Dao cultivation, one must strictly avoid the six desires. Internally, they disturb the heart; they confuse the spirit. When the heart is turbid, qi stagnates. When the six desires stir, the six emotions arise. When the six emotions stir, the six roots become turbid. When the six roots are turbid, the six emotions are stained. When the six emotions are stained, one drifts far from the true Dao.

The three that do not exit are the three primordial *yuans* in the three cinnabar fields. The three primordial *yuans* must not be recklessly discharged. Within the three cinnabar fields are the three *yuans*; when the three *yuans* congeal, they form the Three-in-One. The Three-in-One transform and give rise to the three *hun*; the three *hun* evolve and gather the ten thousand spirits. The ten thousand spirits are the yang spirit of the *Original Dao*. Thus, the *Original Spirit* forms qi; qi binds and forms essence; essence transforms into the ten thousand spirits—hence it is called *spirit*. Spirit is qi; non-being is essence; essence is the Dao; the Dao is thing. Laozi said: "Vague and indistinct, within it there is thing. Thing must not forget thing."

The *Immortals’ Scripture* says: "Projecting qi onto others can give them life; retaining qi within oneself can give oneself life—thus it must not be recklessly discharged." The *Yellow Court Scripture* states: "If the sea of qi were poured out like the hundred rivers, leaves would fall and the tree wither, losing its verdancy—thus it must not be discharged." When all filth and turbidity are expelled, true qi roams the body, ascending to the great void, and one becomes a *Perfected Person*. Since ancient times, those who have ascended to perfection have all followed this Dao.

Expelling filth and turbidity means that through long and persistent practice, one attains the great Dao, and the dregs of the five grains naturally cease entirely. The *Immortals’ Scripture* says: "If you wish not to die, expel the primordial dregs from your abdomen"—hence it is called "completely expelled."

**Middle Chapter of the Original Dao**

Humans are the most numinous among the ten thousand things, born together with heaven and earth at the beginning of the primordial void. Primordial qi congealed and formed their shape. Once the shape was established, the ten celestial spirits descended into the human body and transformed into spirit. Laozi said: "Accumulating essence and gathering radiance, when father and mother unite, yin and yang commingle, in the first month it becomes an embryo; in the second month, a womb; in the third month, a fetus, and the signs of form appear—then the three *hun* descend. In the fourth month, the four spirits guard it. The four spirits are the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior. In the fifth month, the five viscera are settled and secured. In the sixth month, the six pitch-pipes harmonize the six roots. In the seventh month, the seven *po* are born. In the eighth month, the eight scenes appear, and the eight true spirits harmonize. The eight scenes are the five viscera and the three cinnabar fields. In the ninth month, the nine palaces are settled, and the nine *Perfected* are born. The nine palaces are located around the Mud Pill Palace, above and below. In the tenth month, the form is complete, the ten celestial spirits align, the qi of the *Original Dao* is whole, and one receives life." Thus, it is said that humans are born together with heaven and earth at the beginning of the primordial void.

Laozi said: "Heaven and earth unite their essences, and thus give birth to humans." Therefore, humans can achieve their form. It is by attaining the *Original Dao* that they take shape. Since they are born together with heaven and earth at the beginning of the primordial void, they should share the same longevity as heaven and earth. Yet now, heaven and earth endure long, while humans cannot—why is this?

It is said: Heaven and earth endure long because they are warm, quiescent, gentle, and harmonious, never altering their original nature. They constantly abide in emptiness and tranquility, profoundly undisturbed, and thus attain the Dao of spontaneity. Their primordial true does not scatter, so they endure long. Humans cannot long endure because, from birth, they harbor deluded thoughts, alter their original nature, do not adhere to spontaneity, do not guard their root, and bring labor upon themselves. Constantly seeking self-benefit, their thoughts never cease, and their mechanisms are myriad. Thus, primordial qi dissipates with desire, and they cannot attain long life.

Humans cannot endure as long as heaven and earth because heaven is non-acting while humans act; earth is without desire while humans have desires; heaven is constantly luminous while humans obscure themselves; earth is fundamentally solid while humans are frivolous; heaven’s qi revolves while humans’ qi stagnates; earth’s springs lie hidden while humans have qi. These are the ways in which humans oppose heaven and earth. By not guarding the *Original Dao* and embodying the primordial void, they cannot be the same.

Those whose lives extend for countless eons do so by retaining radiance within the body and preserving their life. The six roots are originally empty and quiescent, but humans generate deluded thoughts, and the six thieves lead them astray, so they never return to the root. These six thieves are: the heart deludedly thinking, the eyes deludedly seeing, the ears deludedly hearing, the nose deludedly smelling, the mouth deludedly speaking, and the tongue deludedly tasting. Thus, they cannot return to the root and cannot endure forever.

Returning to the root means restoring the fundamental root of primordial qi. Whenever the thieves disrupt harmony and centrality, one loses their original nature. When the heart harbors delusion, the spirit becomes disordered; when the eyes harbor delusion, they gaze outward; when the ears harbor delusion, they listen outward; when the nose harbors delusion, the numinous gate is lost; when speech harbors delusion, true conduct is lost; when the tongue harbors delusion, the jade fluid does not congeal. All these arise from deluded entanglements, and one drifts far from the Dao.

Restoring the primordial qi follows a path distinct from all other methods—it requires only the settling of the heart into profound stillness. If one can constantly empty the heart and abide in deep tranquility, the primordial qi will naturally return. The method for restoring primordial qi takes regulated breathing as its sign. When the heart-spirit is profoundly still, the breath becomes subtle of its own accord. If the breath is halved, half a lifetime is added. By "half a breath," it means that in one day and night, a person takes fifteen thousand breaths. If one can return to the root and stabilize the breath so that it neither exits nor enters, life is extended by half its original span. From the cessation of breath to the primordial breath, the primordial qi is restored and the root regained—thus one may dwell in the world for eternal kalpas without decay.

The way of breath-holding is most wondrous: by directing the mind to the spirit and obscurely embodying the Dao, the Dao returns to the body, the spirit returns to the root, and the mysterious gate subtly opens. With time, one attains perfection. As the scripture says: "Ordinary people take the presence of breath as the norm; sages take the primordial breath as the norm." The *Yin符经* states: "Death is the root of life—this is the way of the primordial breath." Movement entails breath; stillness, primordial breath. Thus, the primordial breath is the natural Dao. Those who cultivate the primordial Dao should always regard the primordial breath as correct and the presence of breath as incorrect, the primordial breath as constant and the presence of breath as delusion. First, one should make breath-regulation the primary task, for it is easy and yields great merit. If one does not take it as a task, progress will be difficult and merit scant. Simply nurturing qi in profound stillness brings joy to the Three Spirits, and the hun-soul flourishes—then the primordial qi arrives without practice.

Laozi said: "If one can constantly remain pure and still, the myriad spirits all return." The *Huangting Jing* says: "When the heart’s intent is joyfully directed, this is what it means." The Way of the Yellow Court has thirty-six cautions, each caution corresponding to a response. After thirty-six responses, half the merit is achieved. Most Daoist practices require many cautions and responses, but the primordial Dao requires only one caution and three responses to succeed. Thus, those who cultivate the Dao accumulate merit and refine essence into stability.

The one caution is to be cautious of cessation. Therefore, in cultivating the Dao, one must inwardly guard with firm resolve and temporarily forget all affairs—cessation is not permitted. If one is cautious and yet stops, the primordial qi will be lost in an instant.

The three responses are three turns of intent, each turn lasting one hundred days. Merit accumulates in stages, and each stage has its corresponding lunar cycle. The first response occurs after one hundred days: one may cease affairs when necessary, but when there are no affairs, one should remain in stillness. By this time, worldly concerns naturally recede, and no troubling matters can arise. Emptiness and tranquility increase daily—this is the first response, and minor merit is achieved.

The second response occurs after two hundred days: a sudden stillness marks the second turn of intent. By this time, one no longer eats the five grains or craves the five flavors, and hunger and thirst vanish—middle merit is achieved. After two hundred days, minor merit is complete and middle merit fulfilled, and hunger and thirst disappear forever.

The third turn of intent occurs after three hundred days: the primordial qi suddenly stabilizes of its own accord, the primordial Dao returns to the root, hunger and thirst do not arise, cold and heat cannot harm, the register of death is forever erased, and one’s lifespan equals that of heaven and earth. One cycle through the world is complete—this is the achievement of great merit. After attaining the Dao, one’s name is removed from the earthly registers and recorded in heaven. The Dipper of the East records one’s lifespan, the Dipper of the West records one’s blessings, the Dipper of the North removes one’s death, and the Dipper of the South bestows life. One’s name is inscribed in the immortal records, and one becomes a perfected person forever. Thus, the register of death is forever erased. Having attained the rank of true immortal, one enters and leaves the Land of Huaxu, leaving behind the concerns of the vulgar world and ascending to heaven.

"Ceasing affairs when there are no affairs" marks the sprouting of merit. In this method, whether there are affairs or not, all can be set aside—then the primordial qi gradually returns. "Sudden stillness" indicates that the primordial qi is about to stabilize. "Abrupt stillness" means the primordial qi has already stabilized. In stabilization, all things decay, but this stabilized body remains forever unmoved.

The Great Lord said: "From the cessation of breath to the primordial breath, from the primordial breath to stabilization. Stabilization is neither grasping nor relinquishing—it is the stabilization of the primordial, not the stabilization of attachment." Those who attain this stabilization find yin and yang naturally harmonized, the four seasons naturally transcended, the primordial qi naturally full, and the myriad spirits naturally governed. Wisdom penetrates the profound and mysterious.

Laozi said: "Their wisdom awakens of itself, from non-being entering into being." Thus, when yin and yang are harmonized, the hundred diseases do not arise; when the four seasons are transcended, cold and heat cannot harm; when the primordial qi is full, hunger and thirst never occur; when the myriad spirits are governed, tigers and weapons cannot harm; when wisdom penetrates the profound and mysterious, the myriad affairs do not arise—all is the accomplishment of the natural Dao.

"Wisdom" means knowing the world without leaving one’s door, seeing the Dao of heaven without looking through the window. The Great Lord said: "When people’s thoughts and worries are not unified, the primordial qi dissipates, and the yin po-soul flourishes." Only when the merit of this Dao is complete do delusions extinguish themselves.

After three hundred days of cultivation, the cultivator may still be disturbed by yin demons and corpse-ghosts, which stir and provoke madness, arousing intense emotions. One may often retreat—vigilance is essential. Even if something arises, it is not improper; even if something is used, it is not misapplied. There are spontaneous arisings of goodness, wisdom, and penetration—all arise naturally, and joy, anger, sorrow, fear, shock, and aversion never arise.

Those who aspire to the Dao extinguish joy and anger, and misfortune and harm do not arise. Merit and practice perpetuate one another, and subtlety is naturally attained. The Great Lord said: "There is no other way to long life—only the perfection of spirit, qi, and form." Spirit is perfected in emptiness and non-being, qi is perfected in profound stillness, and form is perfected in purity and tranquility. When the primordial qi is full and accumulated—"full" means repletion, "accumulated" means the congealing of transformations into spirit and illumination—the form endures forever. When spirit and qi are both perfected, one can lift the form and ascend as an immortal.

**Method of Qi-Retention and Qi-Circulation**
The oral instruction says: Regulating qi and ceasing breath yields merit slowly; if one retains qi while also circulating qi, merit doubles. To retain qi, wait until the spirit is calm and harmonious, settled and at peace, then retain it—taking it to the utmost is called "circulating freely."

At each session, wait until the time between the crowing of the cockerel and the hour of *yin* (3–5 a.m.), then perform five to seven cycles, gradually increasing to ten. One may also intentionally increase the count, and when both intention and *qi* settle, they settle of themselves, reaching profound tranquility. Initially, one may inhale through the nose, count the breaths, then retain them—pushing this to the utmost brings great benefit without harm, a most subtle and wondrous practice.

When retaining the breath, wait until the usual exhalation is complete before holding it; this is called "not clashing with external *qi*." One should first cool a chamber, select a trusted companion to count the breaths, and proceed gradually, increasing the count over time. Practicing this method of breath-retention and circulation doubles the speed of merit accumulation.

The *Yin Fu Jing* says: "Cut off one source of profit, and your strength becomes tenfold." Yet one must be cautious: violent exhalations and forced inhalations may occur. Beginners cannot always avoid them, so great care is required—restraint in such matters is most refined. If careless, sudden internal injury may result, and what was meant to benefit will instead cause harm.

An immortal scripture says: "Exhale gently, inhale softly—profound principles naturally reveal the mysterious." The Great Lord says: Retaining *qi* can unblock the hundred passages, dissolve obstructions, cure all illnesses, and guide the primordial *qi*. For the practitioner, retaining *qi* is like a gardener irrigating a field: when one channel is filled, water flows through, nourishing all plants. Similarly, a single *qi* transforms into myriad spirits, and the Three Elixir Fields reign supreme—thus the key lies in guiding the primordial *qi*.

Once the hundred passages are unblocked, breathing naturally diminishes, and primordial *qi* flows freely at will. The pathways of fluids open, and wherever primordial *qi* and fluids reach, they first transform into marrow, which never decays. The *Zhong Huang Jing* says:
*"Steam the wasteland, expose the bones to reach all passages,
Grasp firmly, gradually unblock, open the hundred apertures.
The hundred orifices, all linked, each has its spirit—
From your borrowed body, return them to your true self.
Joyfully attaining clarity, you perceive the truth,
And the Way of self-illumination endures forever."*
Thus, the body becomes indestructible.

At first, one feels a gentle warmth throughout the body—this is the primordial *qi* filling the four limbs and overflowing into the hundred orifices, hence the saying: "It is here, responding." Then, one must grasp firmly and guide the *qi* into the Three Elixir Fields. As the Three Elixir Fields emit their flow, it circulates throughout the body, connecting with the hundred spirits, causing even the hair to stir and the complexion to glow, the face as radiant as a maiden’s.

An immortal scripture says: "Not a single hair fails to connect with *qi*, not a single joint fails to house spirit." This is the method of refining the bones. With long practice, one attains golden marrow and jade bones, becoming a long-lived immortal.

The Great Lord says: Diminish breathing and retain *qi*, taking primordial breath as the norm and settled *qi* as the merit. If one still relies on forced breathing, progress is slow; if one focuses solely on retaining *qi*, attaining primordial breath is difficult. But if the hundred passages are unblocked while practicing both *qi*-retention and *qi*-circulation, primordial *qi* naturally fills the body, and merit accumulates swiftly, doubling the speed of attainment.

Primordial *qi* pervades the entire body—stillness without movement is its head, absence of exit and entry its feet. Dissolve the myriad phenomena, quiet the six emotions, thoroughly cleanse the troubled mind, and wash away all thoughts.

**The Lower Scroll: Methods of Primordial Attainment**
The lower scroll discusses the rewards of merit. The scripture says: "Though the first scroll exists, its text is not seen—only when the Dao is attained and ascension nears will it be revealed." The rewards of merit refer to the recompense for cultivating the primordial Dao.

The scripture says: The rewards of merit include the wondrous transformations of immortals, the adornments of divine power, the celestial vehicles of command, the marvelous sights of palaces, the delicacies of banquets, the attendants and servants, the profound joys of leisure—all to repay the merit of cultivation. These are recorded for ten thousand generations, surpassing even the Nine Bestowments of Lord Mao by a hundredfold.

Those who study the primordial Dao must not be remiss. The lower scroll originally listed dozens of sections, of which five are recorded here.

The *Zhong Huang Jing* says: After attaining the Dao, one ascends above the vast heavens, riding in a procession of the Nine Celestial Regalia. What the Heavenly Worthy bestows includes:
Maidens from the ten directions, each bearing banners,
A hundred dragons drawing the chariot,
Jade lads following behind,
Dragon banners ahead, tiger flags behind,
Feathered robes fluttering,
Eight winds blowing in harmony,
Eight *luan* birds singing in chorus,
Nine phoenixes chanting melodies,
A crown of the Seven Luminaries upon the head,
Shoes of five-colored cloud-woven silk upon the feet,
A skirt trailing with cicada-wing sashes,
A robe of layered mist,
A seal of the Golden Tiger at the waist,
Ascending to pay homage to the Supreme Emperor of Grand Clarity—
The Emperor is the Lord of the Golden Tower, the Primordial Elder.

The first reward is for merit,
The second for resolve,
The third for unwavering perseverance,
The fourth for unflagging diligence,
The fifth for not being remiss.
These are the separate records of the rewards of the primordial Dao.

The Great Lord is the Lord of Long Life in the Southern Dipper. If any of these five are neglected, the merit of the primordial Dao will not be fulfilled. One must be cautious in rest and cessation—without rest, nothing will go right. Worldly affairs may be difficult to practice, and at times one must rest. During such rest, one must not be careless; thus, the following admonitions are recorded for those who rest with caution:

One great sigh wastes two days’ merit.
One minor fatigue wastes two days’ merit.
One major fatigue wastes thirty days’ merit.
One minor drunkenness with vomiting wastes sixty days’ merit.
One major drunkenness with vomiting wastes a year’s merit.
One lapse of desire wastes thirty days’ merit.
One great anger wastes twenty days’ merit.
One sorrow or one fear each wastes seven days’ merit.
One overindulgence or one hunger each wastes five days’ merit.
One shock wastes ten days’ merit.
One exhaustion or one weariness each wastes twenty days’ merit.
One vexation or one agitation each wastes five days’ merit.
One rage wastes ten days’ merit.

For all dietary transgressions, imbalances of cold and heat, exposure to wind and damp, irregularities in daily life, or idle chatter—
Laozi said: "Much speech leads to frequent exhaustion; it is better to abide in the center."

The *Scriptures of the Immortals* state: "Those who guard their speech unite with the Dao and truth. They also prevent the leakage of celestial secrets." The *Book of Changes* says: "Be cautious in speech and moderate in diet; inwardly preserve the centered harmony, lest the Dao be lost." The scriptures further warn: "To contend with others over right and wrong depletes hidden merit and shortens lifespan. Excessive thoughts and worries all diminish the primordial qi." According to the severity of each transgression, the degree of depletion is measured, and one must replenish it day by day without negligence. Here, "depletion" means loss. The number of days depleted corresponds to the actual merit lost. Those who cultivate the Dao of primordiality must be profoundly vigilant. Primordial qi is difficult to accumulate yet easy to disperse; the joints are easy to block yet hard to unseal. Though the dwelling qi must not be severed, its depletion demands utmost precision.

In cultivation, one should rise at the first light of dawn, sit upright, and comb the hair over a hundred times to thoroughly unblock the passages. Then, with hair unbound, perform spontaneous *daoyin* exercises, stretch and massage the four limbs, exhale turbid qi with a *he* breath, and gently await the harmonization of primordial qi. Free the mind from thoughts, and let the heart settle into profound stillness. Naturally, the breath will become subtle, and as breathing diminishes, so too will its depletion—halving the breath extends life by half. When breath is reduced to nothingness, the merit of the primordial Dao is perfected. The true persons of antiquity practiced this diligently, and those who never abandoned it for even a moment achieved success in a single year. Those who practiced for two hours daily attained it in five years. Mastery of this Dao elevates one to the rank of *Taiyi Primordial Supreme Perfected Lord*.

From antiquity to the present, the Most High has transmitted this scripture to nineteen individuals, each of whom ascended as immortals to dwell in the Great Ultimate. The text was never left in the world until, in the *wuxu* year of the Yuanhe era of the Great Tang, the *Nantong* Great Lord transmitted it to Meng the Banished Immortal, who in turn disseminated it to the world. It is most profound and wondrous—those who encounter it must keep it secret, for it is not to be shared indiscriminately. To transmit it to the unworthy invites calamity upon the distant and mysterious.

**Eulogy:**
There is the Primordial Dao—
Root of the empty and boundless,
Source of the dark abyss,
Foremost among the ten thousand scriptures.
Gateway of the Three Ones,
Expounding the vast and unfathomable,
Its subtlety finer than dust.
Vast and unknowable, yet trustworthy;
Still and silent, yet spiritually penetrating.
It gives form to the formless,
Aligns with the Dipper and stars.
In its qi, it is the eternal root of the numinous.
Only our Primordial Dao,
Unsettled yet self-clarifying,
Unmuddied even when stirred,
Is the teaching of the primordial and boundless.
In perfect stillness, returning to the root,
Without rigidity or leakage—
All things flourish,
Yet of thirty-five parts,
Only one endures.
Only our Primordial Dao,
Dwelling alone, is supreme.
Formless in form,
Soul of the primordial beginning,
It revolves the sun and moon,
Envelops heaven and earth.
Round yet expanding,
Profound yet returning to simplicity,
Its nature is good and beneficial,
Nurturing all people.
Excess and greed deplete,
Insufficiency is balanced.
Spontaneous, not contrived,
It is fundamentally attuned to humanity.

The *Commentary on the Primordial Dao True Scripture of the Most High Lord Lao* concludes.
