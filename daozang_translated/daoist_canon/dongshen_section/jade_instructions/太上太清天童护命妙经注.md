**Preface to the Commentary on the Supreme and Most Pure *Heavenly Youth’s Wondrous Scripture for Protecting Life***

The Supreme (*Taishang*) is the sovereign of the Mysterious Origin, the master of all sages, most exalted without peer, most lofty without rank. Above, it encompasses all images; in the middle, it universally succors all beings; below, it nurtures the myriad things. In ceaseless generation and transformation, it receives *qi* from the midst of the Great Beginning; in the individuation of each thing, it endows the Dao within the realm of emptiness and non-being. In its thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, none exist beyond the Supreme.

Thus, the Dao of Heaven operates as the *qi* of pure yang; the virtue of the Youth aligns with the perfection of the true. When these two mechanisms harmonize, their wondrous function becomes one—protecting life and nurturing vitality. With the numinous aid of spirit, rhinoceroses and tigers cannot harm, venomous creatures cannot injure. What, then, could be more steadfast? The ultimate efficacy lies in the mechanism of the spirit.

**Commentary on the Supreme and Most Pure *Heavenly Youth’s Wondrous Scripture for Protecting Life***
Annotated by Hou Shanyuan, the Great Mystery Master of Mount Guye.

The Supreme and Most Pure Heavenly Youth,
High Perfection gathers and transforms,
Their divine function boundless.

**Hymn:**
The Supreme, Mysterious Origin, First Honored One,
Seated high upon the lotus in the Jade Clarity Palace,
The Heavenly Youth’s wondrous transformation—perfect luminous body,
Its radiance illumines the world, all phenomena dissolved in emptiness.

*The Wondrous Scripture for Protecting Life.*
Those who recite it dispel evil,
Those who cultivate it gather rectitude.

**Hymn:**
The Supreme personally transmitted *The Scripture for Protecting Life*,
Its profound words and direct speech most clear.
Silently chant it thrice at dawn’s first light,
Countless demons all lose their terror.

Heaven above births me,
Golden Lord, Dao Father,
Shelters my true nature.

**Hymn:**
The ten thousand things arise from the *qi* of the Dao,
Heaven nurtures me, my spirit and *qi* purified.
Within the crucible, the dragon stirs fire,
In the cauldron, the golden elixir gradually coalesces.

Earth below bears me,
Yellow Dame, Receptive Mother,
Moves my form.

**Hymn:**
One *qi*, harmonious and surging, manifests the ten thousand things,
Originally born and produced at the center.
The elixir of immortality nurtured in the cinnabar field,
Only then does one realize the spirit’s journey into the imperial realm.

Sun and moon illuminate me,
Essence of Heaven and Earth,
Stirring pure yang.

**Hymn:**
Where paths cross, the crow flies and the hare courses the waves,
The twin wheels gleam bright, surpassing the celestial river.
The enlightened one, here, opens their clear eyes—
Dare I ask the common person: do you recognize this?

The Northern Dipper assists me,
Heart connected to the seven apertures,
The Dipper’s handle distinct and clear.

**Hymn:**
Turning the Dipper’s mouth, it governs the celestial gate,
Twin meteors flow freely to and fro.
The cauldron’s eye brims, silver waves surge,
The furnace’s door—one expanse of crystal waters churning.

The stars and constellations honor me,
The sky’s essence and refinement,
Illumine my spirit’s concentration.

**Hymn:**
Gazing afar, the yang essence—countless points of radiance,
Rising and descending swiftly as flight.
Nurtured in emptiness, the immortal embryo forms,
Steadily riding the golden dragon into the Supreme Subtlety.

The rivers and streams ferry me,
Winding river of golden waters,
Steadily steering the divine boat.

**Hymn:**
Spiritual waves surge, joining the eastern flow,
Pouring into the vast ocean of the Dharma sea.
Steadily steering the divine boat, traversing all obstacles,
From the water’s heart, directly casting the dragon hook.

The Northern Asterism serves me,
The Northern Asterism first appears,
Serves me, sharing its brilliance.

**Hymn:**
The Northern Culmen’s mysterious subtlety anchors the azure vault,
Heart opened, sudden awakening—no distance too far.
Where the fetal radiance, one point, settles and congeals,
Myriad streams of rosy clouds drift beyond the mundane.

Wind and rain escort me,
The world’s emptiness and stillness,
Rain passed, wind cleared.

**Hymn:**
Thin mist, light smoke, fine rain falls,
Distant peaks, verdant and serene, harmonize.
Where do they escort me?
Striking the sword, riding the dragon, ascending the Purple Tenuity.

The host of immortals lift me,
The assembly of perfected ones aids,
One body, undivided.

**Hymn:**
The host of immortals lifts me to pay homage in the Three Realms,
The assembly of sages supports me into the imperial capital.
Within the Golden Watchtower’s gate, they summon the feathered guest,
On the Jade Empyrean’s roster, the immortal’s name is inscribed.

The Director of Destinies is with me,
Heaven’s Director of Destinies,
Shares my origin.

**Hymn:**
The Director of Destinies, composed, their intent naturally clear,
Calmly with me, nurturing the spirit infant.
The infant grows vast, utterly without thing,
One luminous pearl of spirit-light, shining everywhere.

The Great One empowers me,
The Great One’s mysterious mechanism,
Empowers my divine transformations.

**Hymn:**
The Great One’s crucible opens with a lion’s roar,
The Primordial Cauldron shatters as fire-dragons soar.
Light and flame fill the heavens, scorching the void,
Myriad streams of refined gold gleam with solar radiance.

The Six Ding advance me,
Six gates unobstructed and serene,
Advancing my spirit’s wandering.

**Hymn:**
The Six Ding advance me, free to roam,
Hair unbound, robes flowing, astride a fire-ox,
Grasping my sword, teeth clenched, I devour sun and moon,
Flying talismans pursue and seize the living heads.

Jade Maidens follow me,
Golden Lads lead the way,
Jade Maidens trail behind.

**Hymn:**
Jade Maidens follow me into the grotto’s wanderings,
Pipes and song guide me to the Crystal Tower.
Leaning on the balustrade, the red dust’s affairs vanish,
Only the empty void remains, floating with the sun.

The Five Emperors guard me,
Fivefold radiance of mist,
Gathered into the spirit palace.

**Hymn:**
Five qi ascend to the origin, entering the jeweled palace,
Three flowers scatter like petals through the void.
The Mystic Pearl harmonizes, generating luminous light,
Illuminating the cosmos above and below, all-pervading.

Heaven’s gates open for me,
Ascending to the Golden Watchtower,
Entering and exiting the Gate of Peace.

**Hymn:**
Leisurely riding a white horse through Heaven’s gates,
Strolling at ease to wander the Moon Palace.
The Jade Maiden in the jeweled hall issues a new decree,
Bestowing upon me a sprig of red cinnamon.

Earth’s portals align with me,
The heart connects two apertures,
The spirit’s attainment knows no bounds.

**Hymn:**
A single strike opens the Mystic Pass, Earth’s portals part,
Crimson Palace immortals ascend the Spirit Terrace.
Gazing far, jade flowers bloom in full,
All planted within the red crucible’s fiery heart.

My destiny claims me,
Nature and life both complete,
Essence, qi, and spirit whole.

**Hymn:**
Cultivating qi and preserving spirit follows another Way,
Calming the hun and settling the po, they do not scatter.
The elixir perfected, the heart already attains the sacred,
Boring through walls, piercing mountains, penetrating the sea’s depths.

The Supreme Clarity’s Mystic Register.
The Way of Supreme Clarity,
Mystic Register of the Myriad Spirits.

**Hymn:**
Supreme Clarity eternally guards the Gate of Peace,
Myriad transformations arise within it.
One nature threads through heaven and earth,
The Golden Infant returns to the Jade Dawn Palace.

The Three Palaces ascend and descend,
Rising and falling,
The Three Ones float and sink.

**Hymn:**
The Three Palaces’ ascent and descent determine floating and sinking,
The enlightened heart opens, nature deepens.
The Great One’s crucible adds civil and martial fire,
Within the cinnabar cauldron, refining refined gold.

Endless ascent and descent.
Near and far, intimate and estranged,
The great reckoning knows no end.

**Hymn:**
Endless ascent and descent, form unseen,
The formless body is naturally pure.
Gently refined, the crucible fills with numinous cinnabar,
Brilliant radiance dazzles the eyes.

Golden grain and jade nectar,
All sought-after things arrive.
A single, natural flavor,
Those who partake extend their years.

**Hymn:**
A platter of golden grain steeped in jade nectar,
After sipping, the spirit clears, entering the Great Granary.
Amid five-colored clouds, I pay homage to the Sage Lord,
Within the Purple Tenuity’s hall, I present myself to the Luminous August One.

The Void and Brahman, sun and moon,
The precious mirror suspended,
The Dao-eye lofty and bright.

**Hymn:**
The Void and Brahman resplendent, illuminating the Great Net,
High-hung sun and moon shine upon the mundane world.
Within the crucible, mercury drips drop by drop,
Forging red cinnabar until the cauldron overflows.

I swear by Heaven.
Heaven’s nature is human,
The human heart is the mechanism.

**Hymn:**
Heaven’s nature is human, humanity mirrors Heaven,
Heaven and humanity unite, establishing the root.
Where does the root merge into oneness?
Vast and boundless, before the myriad transformations.

Ghosts and goblins, demons and specters,
The title of the Northern Culmen,
Receiving the orthodox, expelling the perverse.

**Hymn:**
The Northern Culmen’s Primordial Lord guards the upper realm,
Teeth clenched, sword in hand, slaying demon kings.
Goblins, specters, and demons all perish,
Transformed entirely into formless blood-light.

What is pursued is accomplished,
Those who turn away die,
Those who turn toward live.

**Hymn:**
The elixir, once refined, never withers,
In the void of the Mysterious Female, breath flows free.
The White Tiger ever devours the Golden Phoenix’s marrow,
The Black Dragon constantly drinks the Sun’s butter.

What spirit does it not command?
Every person has a share,
Every thing follows its course.

**Hymn:**
The myriad spirits rejoice as the Three Lights gather,
The supreme Dao, unborn, attains eternal endurance.
Ever invert mercury and lead in their use,
And naturally the elixir coalesces into pure yang.

What decree goes unfulfilled?
Heaven and earth, the ten thousand things,
Are born by receiving qi.

**Hymn:**
At the first stirring of yang, the yellow sprout flourishes,
The two qi intertwine, the white snow clarifies.
The two flavors blend in sixteen ounces,
Perfecting the form of a single luminous pearl.

Above, the Vermilion Bird,
The Fire Dragon coils atop the crown,
The Cinnabar Phoenix congeals yang.

**Hymn:**
The Vermilion Bird leaves its nest, chasing the sun in flight,
Ascending to the Celestial Valley, piercing the clouds.
Spreading its golden wings, it grinds the stars,
Pushing the sunlight to fill the Grand Tenuity.

Below, the Dark Warrior,
The Black Tortoise of the Water Palace,
The essence of the Great Yin.

**Hymn:**
The Dark Warrior moves through the Water Palace’s halls,
A crimson serpent entwines it, born in fire.
In an instant, a well of golden waves surges,
Pouring into the red crucible, filling the cauldron for refining.

To the left, the Azure Dragon,
The dragon from the Thunder position,
Mercury born in the west.

**Hymn:**
The Azure Dragon leaps forth from the eastern isles,
Unfurling red clouds to shroud the Jade Capital.
Twin bolts of lightning crackle like thunder,
The Three Heavens tremble, subduing rivers and lakes.

To the right, the White Tiger,
The tiger from the Lake position,
Lead born in the east.

**Hymn:**
The White Tiger retreats deep into the Lake’s domain,
Seated in stillness upon Mount Sumeru, it radiates dragon-light.
Piercing the cosmos, all demons retreat,
It alone rules mountains and rivers, guarding the seas.

Those who love me live,
Nurturing spirit and cultivating qi,
Preserving life to attain longevity.

**Hymn:**
Let not the fire-timing of yin and yang err,
As lead in the crucible flies frost and spits emerald sand.
A single luminous pearl rolls in inversion,
Its essence illuminating the heavens with crimson radiance.

Those who despise me meet misfortune,
Greed and wrath deplete qi,
Jealousy harms the spirit.

**Hymn:**
Let not greed, wrath, or jealousy arise,
Trust in the world’s freedom to roam at ease.
When stillness encounters the clamor of corpse-ghosts,
Draw the sword from your sleeve to slay the Three Corpses.

Those who scheme against me die,
Wealth, beauty, profit, and fame—
Those who cling to them perish.

**Hymn:**
Do not contend for fame or fortune,
For love and desire deepen karmic debt.
The enlightened transcend and keep their distance,
While the deluded remain forever entangled.

Those who hate me perish.
The mind-monkey and intent-horse—
If indulged, they bring ruin.

**Hymn:**
When demonic ghosts and yin spirits stir in chaos,
Grasp firmly and preserve the spirit, allowing no intrusion.
When stillness is disturbed by worldly affairs,
Release the moon of the heart to illuminate the void.

Three thousand six hundred Jade Maidens
Ever attend me,
The myriad spirits gather,
Never leaving my body.

**Hymn:**
A throng of immortals, their qi pure and refined,
In the depths of rosy clouds, they celebrate peace.
A celestial melody resounds in the void,
As they escort the Perfected One into the Grotto-Heaven.

Holding talismans and bearing commands,
They wander with me.
In walking, standing, sitting, or lying,
They follow my every movement.

**Hymn:**
The Jade Maidens wander with me in the land of eternal night,
Phoenixes and simurghs welcome the chariot into the Hall of Light.
The Golden Lads offer nectar of jade,
Its fragrance so pure it cools the crown of the head.

The Most High presides over the capital,
The Lofty Perfected assume their ranks,
The host of sages comes to pay homage.

**Hymn:**
The Most High, suspended in emptiness, sits upon the jeweled lotus,
Unfurling the sun of wisdom to illuminate boundlessly.
All immortals are gathered in the ranks of the Lofty Perfected,
The host of sages comes to pay homage before the throne.

Heaven’s great fortune prospers.
Vast and empty, tranquil and still,
Profound and serene, full and void.

**Hymn:**
The Primordial qi of the Chaos determines rise and fall,
Alone in the boundless void, the myriad forms begin.
Beyond the thousand kalpas, in the distant and mysterious,
Clear and still, it pervades the formless.

The twenty-four talismans,
Divine talismans dispel illness,
The heart-seal expels perversity.

**Hymn:**
Divine talismans sever misfortune, yin evils vanish,
The heart-seal expels perversity, the Dao naturally arises.
The golden register and mysterious rites are personally transmitted,
Aiding the people and assisting the nation in eternal peace.

In accord with the stars and calendar.
The starry river gleams like jade,
The moon of the heart is pure as ice.

**Hymn:**
The starry river gleams, piercing the silver toad,
The Supreme Perfected One is revered in worship.
The Jade Maidens draw open the halls of autumn waters,
The Golden Lads raise the curtains of night’s radiance.

Swiftly, swiftly, as in the law’s command!
Grasp the meaning within the scripture,
Hasten to cultivate and uphold it.

**Hymn:**
Cultivating merit and conduct, both tasks complete,
Suddenly one ascends lightly, transformed into a flying immortal.
The Azure Lads lead the way to the Court of the Origin,
The crane-drawn chariot and fragrant winds enter the Grotto-Heaven.

Here ends the commentary on *The Wondrous Scripture of the Heavenly Lads Protecting Life, from the Supreme Clarity of the Great High*.
