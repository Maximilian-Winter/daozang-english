**Preface to the Collected Commentaries on the Dao De Jing**

The *Records of the Historians* (Shiji) states:
*"Laozi, born in the village of Qu Ren in Le Xiang, Ku County, the state of Chu. Ku is pronounced ‘hu’ (怙). Originally belonging to Chen, when Chu annexed Chen, it became part of Chu—this is now Zhenyuan County in Bo Prefecture. Le is sometimes written as Li. Du Yu notes that the Le River flows to its west, hence the name of the village. His family name was Li, given name Er, with the courtesy name Boyang, posthumously honored as Dān (聃). He served as the Keeper of Archives in the Zhou dynasty, and Confucius once visited Zhou to inquire about rites from him."*

The *Zhouli: Zengzi’s Questions* (礼记·曾子问), annotated by Zheng Xuan, states:
*"Lao Dān was an ancient title for longevity. He was contemporary with Confucius."* The commentary elaborates: *"Lao Cong (老聪) is Laozi."*

The *Shuowen Jiezi* (说文解字) states:
*"Peng (鹏) means ‘ear-like’ (曼)."*

The annotation in the *Book of Later Han: Biography of Dou Zhang* (后汉书·窦章传) states:
*"Laozi served as both the Keeper of Archives and the G

In the reign of King Zhao, observing the wondrous *zǐqì* (紫炁) drifting westward and celestial omens manifesting, he knew that a sage would soon pass through the Hangu Pass and journey west. Thus, he sought to be appointed as the Pass Warden, and the king complied.

Upon arriving at the Pass, he declared:
*"The Yang numbers reach their peak at nine, the stars align with Metal, the year and month coincide with the king’s reign—by law, a great sage shall pass through the capital within ninety days."*

He first instructed the Pass officer, Sun Jing, saying:
*"If there be a stranger of unusual appearance, with distinctive carriage and attire, do not allow passage."*

Emblem Xī (喜) prepared himself with fasting and purification, sweeping the road and burning incense in anticipation.

At that time, in the twenty-third year of King Zhao’s reign, on the fifth month’s *rénwǔ* (壬午) day, the Old Master, riding a green ox-drawn chariot with a thatched canopy and Xu Jia as his charioteer, set out to civilize the Western Regions.

On the twelfth day of the seventh month, *jiǎzǐ* (甲子), a venerable old man appeared—his hair snowy white, his ears long—riding a white carriage drawn by a green ox.

The officers said:
*"The magistrate has ordered: Kind sir, please tarry a moment."*

They then reported to Xī, who immediately donned his official robes and went out to greet him, bowing his head in reverence.

The Old Master declined three times, but Xī said:
*"Last winter, the tenth month, the Celestial Pattern Star passed west over the Pleiades. This month’s new moon saw the *róngfēng* (融风) three times, and the true *qi* of the East, like a dragon-serpent, moved westward—this is the sign of a great sage."*

Thus, he arranged for the Old Master to stay in the official guesthouse and seated him in accordance with the rites for a master-disciple relationship.

Xī then feigned illness and resigned his post. On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, he escorted the Old Master back to his home. On the twenty-eighth day, the Old Master imparted the *Wǔqiānzi* (五千言). The following year, on the twenty-eighth day of the fourth month, he bade farewell on the southern mountain’s mound and ascended to heaven, instructing that he would be sought again after a thousand days at the Green Sheep Market.

In the twenty-seventh year, they met at the home of Li Taiguan in Shu. At that time, the celestial hosts and immortals descended from the sky, and the Old Master commanded the Five Elders and the Supreme Deities to grant Xī a jade tablet with golden inscriptions, bestowing upon him the title *Wénshǐ Xiānsheng* (文始先生) and the rank of *Wúshàng Zhēnrén* (无上真人). He was also granted a purple robe and a peony-crowned cap, and allowed to wander beyond the Eight Strings (of the celestial sphere).

He was called *Lǎozi* (老子) because he was born with white hair, and also because he cultivated the Dao and nourished his longevity.

The *Dàodéjīng* (道德经) expounds upon the principles of virtue and the Way, and may be followed perpetually.

The *Tang Yìwén Zhì* (唐艺文志) states:
*"During the Tianbao era, it was further titled the *Lǎozi Xuāntōng Dàodéjīng* (老子玄通道德经)."*

Ge Xuan’s preface reads:
*"The Five Thousand Words proclaim the source of virtue and the Way, encompassing all that is great without exclusion, all that is minute without omission—it is the natural scripture of heaven and humanity."*

Bān Gù recorded the traditions of Laozi, with Fu Shi’s thirty-seven chapters, Lin Shi’s four, Xu Shi’s six, and Liu Xiang’s four. Du Guangting noted the commentators:
*"There are Emblem Xī’s Inner Exegesis, Han Zhang Daoling’s Xiang’ěr, He Shang Gong’s Chapter-by-Chapter Analysis, Yan Zun’s Indicators, Wei Wang Bi, He Yan, Guo Xiang, Zhong Hui, Sun Deng, Jin Yang Fu, Pei Chu Si, Fu Jian’s monk Luo Shi, Hou Zhao’s Fo Tuo Cheng, Jin Seng Zhao, Liang Tao Hong Jing, Hou Wei Lu Jingyu, Liu Renhui, Nan Qi Gu Huan, Song Ling Xianren, Qi Du Pi, Song Zhang Ping, Liang Wu Di, Liang Jian Wen Di, Zhang Si, Liang Dao Shi Zang Xuan Jing, Meng Anpai, Meng Zhizhou, Dou Lue, Chen Dao Shi Chu Rou, Sui Dao Shi Li Bo, Liu Jinxi, Tang Wei Zheng, Fu Yi, Yang Shangshan, Jie Zhi, Wang Guangting, Wang Zhen, the Immortal Hu Chao, the Daoist Song Wenming, Yin Wencao, Wei Lu, Wang Xuanbian, Yin Yan, Xu Mian, He Siyuan, Xue Jichang, Wang Di, Zhao Zhijian, Che Huibin, Li Rong, Li Yuanxing, Zhang Huichao, Gong Fashi, Ren Taixuan, Shen Fu, Zhang Daoxiang, Cheng Xuan Ying, Fu Shaoming."*

The *Tang Yìwén Zhì* further lists:
*"An Qiu Wangzhi, Xiang Yi (whose surname is lost), Cheng Shao, Wang Shang, Shu Cai, Yuan Zhen, Shi Huìyán, Huìlín, Yìyíng, Liang Kuangshu, Li Yunyuan, Chen Sigu, Feng Kuò, Xuánjǐng Xiānsheng, Yang Shangqi, Han Du, Jia Dayin, Bìlǘ Rénxù, Liu Zhongrong, Wang Su, Dai Yan, Yuán Zōng, Lú Cángyòng, Xíng Nánhé, Féng Cháo yǐn, Bái Fùzhōng, Yín Zhīzhāng, Lǚ Dé Míng, Chén Tíngyù, Lǚ Xīshēng, Wú Shànjīng, Sūn Sīmiào, Lǐ Hán Guāng—forty families in total."*

Yet in the *Zàng* (藏), those preserved include Li Yue, Jia Qingyi, Wang Gu, and Du Guangting—all Tang-era figures—some not even recorded in the *Zhì*. Thus, it is known that the records are still incomplete.

Alas, of those whose names survive but whose works are lost, nine out of ten are gone.

He Shang Gong divided it into eighty-one chapters, corresponding to the extreme number of the Taiyang (Great Yang).

The *Upper Scripture* has thirty-seven chapters, following the odd numbers of heaven; the *Lower Scripture* has forty-four, following the paired numbers of earth.

Liu Yin’s *Qīlüè* (七略) states:
*"Liu Xiang established it as two sections of eighty-one chapters: thirty-four in the Upper, forty-seven in the Lower."*

Yet Ge Hong and others later added or subtracted, claiming:
*"Heaven completes with four seasons, hence the Upper Scripture has four nines—thirty-six chapters. Earth completes with five phases, hence the Lower Scripture has five nines—forty-five chapters, totaling the nine-nine number."*

Qīngyuánzi Liu Jì said:
*"If spoken hastily, it was never divided into nine sections."*

Yan Zun, considering the nine Yang and eight Yin multiplied together, made seventy-two chapters—forty in the Upper, thirty-two in the Lower.

Wang Bi combined the Upper and Lower into a single text, without division into chapters.

Today’s editions mostly follow He Shang Gong’s chapter divisions, or group them into Upper and Lower Scriptures.

Dòng Áo of Guangchuan noted:
*"After Emperor Xuānzōng of Tang annotated the *Lǎozi*, the chapter divisions were first standardized."*

The text that speaks of the **Dao/Way** is classified in the **Upper Scripture**, while the text that speaks of **virtue/power** is classified in the **Lower Scripture**; these were engraved in stone at the **Yuékǒu Temple** in **Lǎozi’s** lineage.

Emperor Xuānzōng’s annotation explained:
*"The **Dao/Way** is the essence of **virtue/power**; **virtue/power** is the application of the **Dao/Way**. The Scripture is divided into Upper and Lower to first elucidate the **Dao/Way**, followed by **virtue/power**. Yet at its conclusion, it states:*
*'Thus one knows that essence and application are mutually expressed, each clarifying the core principle, and there is no need to rigidly name them as Upper or Lower.'*

Dòng Áo of **Jiāngmào** remarked:
*"In my past visits to libraries, I have seen ancient texts where the sequence of the *Lǎozi* differs greatly from today’s chapter divisions, and I have also doubted whether later scholars may have altered its original structure."*

Emperor Xuānzōng commanded **Sīmǎ Zǐwēi** to transcribe the text in three styles (**sān tǐ**—likely referring to *old text*, *transmitted text*, and *commentary*), resulting in a version of **5,380 characters**.

Fù Yì examined numerous manuscripts and verified their character counts, stating:
*"The **Xiàngyǔ’s Concubine’s** manuscript was unearthed from her tomb in **Péngchéng** by a local scholar in the **5th year of Qí Wǔpíng’s** reign (269 CE).
The **Ānqiú Wàngzhī’s** manuscript was obtained by the **Daoist** **Kòu Qiānzhī** during the **Wèi Tàihé** era (227–233 CE).
The **Héshàng Zhàngrén’s** manuscript was passed down by the **recluse** **Qiú Yuè** of **Qí**."*

The three manuscripts total **5,722 characters**, which aligns closely with *Han Fei’s* *Yù Lǎozǐ* [《喻老》]. The **Lòuyáng official edition** contains **5,635 characters**, while **Wáng Bì’s** version has **5,683 characters**, with variations of **610, 355, or 590 characters**—the counts differ.

The *Records of the Grand Historian* states it contains over **5,000 words**, though not reaching **6,000**, which is accurate. The current claim of **5,000 characters** refers to the full count.

**Péng Zhì’s** *Huáng Sòng* compilation includes commentaries by:
- Emperor Xuānzōng’s *Zhènghé* imperial annotations,
- Daoist **Chén Jǐngyuán**,
- **Sīmǎ Wēngōng Guāng**,
- **Sū Wéndìng**,
- **Wáng Jīnggōng Ānshí**,
- **Wáng Pán**,
- **Lù Tiǎn**,
- **Liú Gài**,
- **Liú Jǐng**,
- **Xiān Gū Cáodàochōng**,
- **Mǎ Tíshān**,
- **Dázhēn Zǐ**,
- **Yīliǎo Zǐ**,
- **Lǐ Wénchóu**,
- **Chén Xiànggǔ**,
- **Yè Mèngdé**,
- **Qīngyuán Zǐ Liú Jì**,
- **Zhū Wén Gōng Xī**,
- **Huáng Màocái**,
- **Chéng Wénjiǎn Gōng Dàchāng**,
- **Lín Dōng**,
- **Shào Ruòyú**,
- **Ní Wénjié**,
- **Gāo Shì Xú Zhīcháng**,
and others—though not all are listed exhaustively.

In essence, the **Dao of Lǎozǐ** takes **cleansing, non-action, and natural spontaneity** as its core, **emptiness and clarity in responding to things without obstruction** as its application, **compassion, frugality, humility, and non-contentiousness** as its conduct, and **desirelessness, non-interference, and non-precedence over Heaven to benefit humanity** as its governance. In governing self and others, it attains the utmost.

If applied, the governance of **Tàigǔ** could be restored.

The *Records of the Han*’s *Arts and Literature Register* states:
*"The Daoist school holds fast to the essentials and roots, guards itself in purity and emptiness, and maintains itself in humility and weakness—this is the art of ruling as a sovereign."*

**Ouyáng Xiū** in *Chóngwén Zǒngshū* writes:
*"Rooted in purity and emptiness, abandoning ambition and greed, serene and self-guarded, hence the saying: ‘I do nothing, yet the people transform; I love stillness, yet the people align.’ Even the Sage’s governance cannot surpass this."*

Given the times, when literary flourish prevailed and the pure, unadorned customs had vanished, **Lǎozǐ** upheld his **unadulterated Dao**, aligning with the age’s extremes. Though he responded only when moved, he could not attain office to propagate his Dao across the world. Yet he knew the **fate of the times**, yet still his teachings did not vanish—thus, he taught without distinction, and though his influence extended to the **Western lands of strange customs**, how profound was his pity for his own time and concern for posterity!

Fortunately, this text endured, so **Xīguān** awaited his arrival, **Dōnglǔ** beheld his dragon, and the **Book and its words** still remain.

Figures like **Héshàng Zhàngrén**, **Huángshí Gōng**, **Lèchén Gōng**, and **Gài Gōng**’s disciples understood its essence and embodied it, refining its applications within themselves—thus, their world already resembled **Xīnhuáng’s** era.

When his Dao was passed on, **Emperor Xiào** ruled by it, **Zǐfáng** assisted the **Hàn**, and **Cáo Shēn** governed **Qí**, truly reviving the **unbroken lineage** after the **tyranny of Qín**.

Ah! This is verified.

Yet if one were to surpass this—if one followed **Xīnhuáng’s** model, one would indeed achieve **Xīnhuáng’s** governance.

Some see this book’s **grand and expansive words** but fail to grasp its **subtle essence of emptiness, stillness, and profound sincerity**, mistaking its **foundation for all affairs** as mere **obscure, sluggish dullness**, thus falling into **indulgent neglect**, leading to the criticism that **emptiness fails in application**. Hence, they dismiss it without examination.

Alas, what a pity!

**Wén Zhōngzǐ** said: *"Prolonged emptiness led to the chaos of the Jìn—this was not Lǎozǐ’s fault."*

**Zhū Wén Gōng** declared: *"The Jìn officials merely used his words to justify their abandonment of ritual and law. Given their corrupt and turbulent hearts, how could they comprehend Lǎozǐ’s true intent?"*

In the *Old Book of Tang*, **Lǐ Fān** replied: *"Lǎozǐ’s* **Zhǐguī** *differs not from the Six Classics."*

**Li Yào**, a **Bīngbù Láng** of the Tang, stated: *"The world claims this book speaks of divine immortality and emptiness, yet the Six Classics are merely its branches—**Huáng-Lǎo’s** offshoots."*

Thus, **Sīmǎ Qiān** in discussing the **Great Dao** prioritized **Huáng-Lǎo** over the Six Classics—not without reason.

Though the **grand principles** of this text are evident in various commentaries, some criticize its lack of **moderation**. I, a **dim-witted late learner**, presumptuously adopt and synthesize these views, adding my own insights to supplement a few gaps. Sometimes I **explicate the text**, sometimes **elaborate its intent**, appending **phonetic annotations** and **cross-referencing discrepancies**, aiming to aid comprehension. May this lead to **daily improvement**, aligning with the **Dao beyond words** in the realm of **absolute learning and carefree wisdom**.

Some say **subtle teachings and hidden precepts** abound, thus the **first chapter’s "having" and "not having"** refer to the **Two Elixirs**—**spiritual qi and water-fire**. **Emptying the heart and filling the belly** signifies **refining lead**; **skilled warfare** denotes **extracting lead**.

The character **chōng** (冲), composed of **water and center**, symbolizes **true-one qi within the breath**. **Thirty spokes converge at one hub**, illustrating the **five viscera each harboring six qi**, as well as the **monthly fire符’s alignment**.

Such meanings are now omitted.

Some interpret **"not having"** as **Earth’s Two Fire**, and **"having"** as **Heaven’s One Water**, thus citing the *Gǎngtōng Jué*:
*"Two voids submit to one existence—mysterious transformation, beyond comprehension."*

And they derive the **gold-water theory** of **"preserving white while embracing black"**, though this pertains to **Great Elixir methods**, aligning with the **Yì’s symbols**, modeling **Heaven and Earth**, using **sun-soul and moon-shadow as medicines**—as seen in:
- **Shénnóng’s** ancient *Lónghǔ Shàngjīng* (36 characters),
- **Huáiyáng Wáng’s** *Jīnbì Yàozhǐ Jīng* (Western Han),
- **Wèi Bóyáng’s** *Cāntóng Qì* (Eastern Han),
- **Yuányáng Zǐ’s** *Jīnbì Qiántōng Jué* (Tang).

Thus, the methods are established.

「As the *Hùnyuán Shílù* states: The **Dao Master** first taught **Yín Zhēn** the **Inner and Outer Two Elixirs** as safeguards, then revealed the **principles of Dao and virtue**. Thus, it is clear that **Elixir Craft** was not intermingled with the **fundamentals of this Scripture**.

Moreover, the **Three-One-Nine Thoughts** (三一九思) are the essence of **inner cultivation**. The **Nine Elixirs of Golden Liquid** (九丹金液) represent the pinnacle of **external refinement**. Hence, the **Too-Qīng Scriptures** he was taught focus solely on the **external refinement of Golden Liquid**, though they differ little from the **Great Elixir methods** mentioned earlier.

Later disciples, seeing the **altars, furnaces, and crucibles** (坛炉鼎灶) set up, mistakenly regarded **sacred minerals and metals** (灵砂金石) as **external elixirs**. Little did they know that **post-heaven substances** (后天) are impure and **yin-heavy** (阴杂非类), consuming them causes agitation, loss of clarity, and failure to grasp their true nature.

Others further say: **"Not having"** refers to **Spirit** (神), **"having"** to **Qi** (氣). Thus, the **interplay of presence and absence** (有无交入) is the **foundation of Elixir**, while **"hidden and revealed"** (隐显相符) correspond to the **interaction of Water and Gold**. **"White within black"** (黑中有白) signifies the **Elixir Matrix**, and the **poetic lines on the unity of the thirty-two spokes with the hub** (三十辐兮同一毂) serve as proof. Though these interpretations all borrow phrases from the Scripture to construct their own **precepts**, they form a distinct **school**, namely the **method of Inner Elixir**.

As for **Yín Zhēn’s** received **Three-One-Nine Thoughts** (三一九思), though termed **inner cultivation**, they differ fundamentally from the **Inner Elixir lineage**. In essence, **Dao, methods, and Scriptures** each have their own **purpose and scope**; one cannot exhaust all schools with a single text. If forced to merge them, such interpretations are merely **fabricated analogies**.

Why? **Nature must be self-awakened** (性由自悟), while **methods rely on transmission from a teacher** (术假师传). If these truths are indeed **concealed within profound meaning**, the adept must receive **oral instruction in meticulous detail** before doubts are dispelled. How can mere **written words** suffice?

Moreover, the Scripture **proclaims the Dao of virtue and non-action**, transcending all forms, and **penetrating the subtlest cycles**. How could it accommodate such **external speculations and minor arts**?

**Bái Lètiān** remarked: *"The Five-Thousand-Word Scripture of the Primordial Emperor speaks not of medicines, not of immortals, nor of ascending to the Green Sky in White Day."* This is a sound observation.

**Sū Wénzhōnggōng** (蘇文忠公) **Zhuó** composed the **inscription for the Chǔxiáng Palace** upon imperial command. Its general meaning is as follows:

The **Daoist tradition** originates with **Huángdì** and **Lǎozǐ**. Its **Dao** is **purity, tranquility, and non-action**; its **application** is **clarity and responsiveness**; its **conduct** is **modesty, benevolence, and non-contentiousness**. This aligns with the *Yì*’s **"What thoughts? What contemplations?"** and the *Lúnyǔ*’s **"The virtuous person is tranquil and attains longevity."**

Since the **Han Dynasty**, Daoists began incorporating **alchemists’ teachings**, introducing **arts of transcendence and transformation**, such as the **Yellow Court and Great Cavern methods**, the **titles of Wood Official and Golden Mother**, and the **veneration of Tàiyǐ and Zǐwēi**. Even **external elixir techniques, talismans, and minor arts** were all subsumed under **Daoist practice**.

I have pondered this: The **Dao of Huángdì and Lǎozǐ** is the **foundation**; the **alchemists’ words** are the **branches**. Grasping the foundation naturally leads to the branches. Alas, cultivating it **for oneself**, one’s **virtue is genuine**; applying it **to the world**, one’s **virtue becomes universal**—not two distinct foundations.

If scholars truly **master the One** and **unify its principles**, then the so-called **"profound and elusive essences"** and **"flickering, wondrous subtleties"** will **manifest within the practice of guarding the Center and embracing the One** (守中抱一), while the **"mysterious feminine"** and **"the use of the gourd’s latch"** (橐钥之用) are all **works of the Dao**. Only those **deeply cultivated and self-actualized** understand this.

Written in the **twelfth month of the 11th year of Chúnyòu** (淳佑丙午腊月), by the **humble student Dòng Sījìng** of **Qīngyuán Tiānqìng Guān** (清源天庆观), at **Jūishān** (圭山).

**Volume One of *Dàodé Zhēnjīng Jíjiě* (道德真经集解) – Exegesis by the Humble Student Dòng Sījìng**

*"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;
The name that can be named is not the eternal name."*

This **precedes the entire discourse**, marking its **beginning**.

**Dao** is the **comprehensive term for all principles** (万理之总名).
**Name** is the **designation of all things** (万物之所指).

Yet **Dao cannot be named**—not because words are inadequate, but because **Dao must be conveyed through words**, and though **forced to name it as Dao**, it is **not the eternal Dao or name**. Thus, the **Dao that can be named** and the **name that can be named** are **not the eternal Dao and name**.

The **eternal Dao and name** are as the Scripture states: **Dao is eternal and nameless**, yet **its name persists from antiquity to the present**. **Eternal** means **naturally enduring**, without **time or place** where it does not exist.

**Nameless**, the **beginning of Heaven and Earth**—this speaks of **Dao as the origin of all things under Heaven**.

Since **Dao lacks any trace or sign**, none can name it. This is the **eternal Dao and name**, the **form beyond form** (形而上).

**Having a name**, the **mother of all things**—this refers to **the Two Principles established**, where **all things can be named**, and **all existence arises from here**, the **form within form** (形而下).

*"Eternal non-desire, to observe its mystery"*—this means the **Sage embodies Dao within oneself**, remaining **serene and unmoving**, while **the Spirit’s presence** is **what is stored**. Here, **Dao’s subtlest essence** is **visible**.

**Eternal** is the **true, constant, and wondrous origin** (真常妙本).
Non-desire is **stillness**—this is **Dao’s constant nature**.
Desire is **movement**—this is **Dao’s active function**.

Though **stillness and movement** are not simultaneous, **essence and function** must be **distinct**. Yet the **wondrous origin** is **profoundly settled**, **still yet ever-responsive**, **responsive yet ever-still**, never ceasing—**eternally as it is**.

Thus, it is called *"eternal observation"*—**impartial and vast**, **illuminating all stillness**.

*"Eternal desire, to observe its boundary"*—this is the **time of response and adaptation**, where **Dao’s wondrous function** can be **observed**.

This refers to **movement’s visible aspects**, as **Zhōu Zǐ** said: *"Stillness is nameless; movement is named."*

**Chén Jǐngyuán** remarked: *"The great Dao has a lesser path called the boundary."* These two—**nameless and named**, **mystery and boundary**—**share the same source yet differ in name**, both called **the Profound** (玄).

*"The Profound yet again profound—
The gateway to all wonders."*

This **concludes the preceding meaning**.

The two refer to **nameless and named**, **mystery and boundary**. Since **essence and function** stem from **one source**, they are **the same**.

**"Out" (出) is the meaning of movement and stillness.**

It refers to either movement or stillness, yet **essence and function** are divided within them, hence it is called **"different names"**.

Though the names differ, their **source is one**, so it is also called **"the same"**.
Only when they are **the same**, their **nature and disposition** are profound and unquestionable—this is called **the Profound (玄)**.

All things that are **far-reaching and without limit** must have **their hue as the Profound (玄)**, and in the human heart, this is the meaning of **abyssal silence and formlessness**.

Though **the Profound (玄)** is **endlessly transformative and unfathomably deep**, yet **the heart of the Profound** still exists within it.

Again, **the Profound (玄)**, it **discards the burdens of stagnant profundity**, **serene yet leaving no trace**, yet able to **open and close yin and yang**, **generate transformations without cessation**—this is because **it lies at the most subtle juncture of affairs and principles**, and **all wonders arise from it**, hence it is called **the gateway to all wonders**.

This entire chapter is named **"The Chapter of Essence and Dao"** by Master Héshànggōng (河上公), while other scholars often take the first few characters of the chapter as its title.
This chapter **embodies the core intent** of the *Guīxù* (揆序) Canon.

Someone asked: *"What of 'named' and 'nameless'?"* Earlier masters often took **"without" (无) and "with" (有)** as the key phrases, but now it is not so—why?

I say: **"The nameless" is the Dao**, **"the named" is qi (炁)**.
Only the Dao is **formless**, while qi has **manifestations**—thus they are distinguished by **"nameless" and "named"**.

When it is said **"the nameless at the beginning of heaven and earth"**, it means the Dao **existed before heaven and earth**, yet **initially there was no fixed name to point to**, hence the Canon says *"The Dao is ever nameless"* and *"The Dao is hidden and nameless"*.

Though the Dao is **omnipresent**, transcending **the state before any thingness (无物)**, it is also **never absent from the state after any thingness (有物)**.
Thus, in **non-being (无)**, it is **non-being**; yet it **never stagnates in non-being**.
In **being (有)**, it is **being**; yet it **never confines itself to being**.
Only because it **cannot be fixedly named**, yet its name has **always existed from antiquity**, this is why it is called **"the eternal Dao and the eternal named"**.

If one were to **directly name it "without" (无)**, then it would be **restricting the Dao solely to non-being**, and when **non-being transforms into being**, one could no longer call it **"without"**.

Being and non-being **interdependently arise**, transformations **ceaselessly unfold**, and names **shift accordingly**—how could this be called **"eternal named"**?

The **mere presence or absence of "without" (无)** is **insufficient to discuss the Dao**.
If one insists on calling it **"without"**, one risks **falling into the void of empty stillness (空寂)**.
Then, where does **the myriad transformations of heaven and earth** truly **originate**?

Now, when it is said **"the nameless"**, it is only because **it is tranquil and boundless**, **formless and beyond naming**.
Yet, within **this formlessness and namelessness**, the **principles of heaven and earth and all things** are **fully inherent**—this is why it **cannot be directly called "without"**.

The Dao **cannot be named**; only the sage **refrains from speaking** can suffice.
If one **must establish speech**, then **naming is necessary** to **reveal its Dao**.
Yet there is fear that scholars **will cling to words and phrases**, **boxing the Dao into rigid definitions**—
hence the Canon **first declares at the beginning**:
*"The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao;
The name that can be named is not the eternal name."*
Its meaning is **profound indeed**.

Someone asked: *"What of 'eternal without desire' and 'eternal with desire'?"*
Earlier masters often took **"eternal without" (常无) and "eternal with" (常有)** as standalone couplets,
but even this is not correct—why?

I say: **"The sage’s heart never truly has desire**;
when it is said **"eternal with desire"**, it is only **referring to the point where desire arises**.

When **still and non-acting (静而无为)**, it is **eternal without desire**.
When **responding to things and moving**, though **never truly departing from stillness (静)**,
yet **in all affairs and matters**, there are **boundaries, edges, and limits that become visible**—
**visible**, hence **opposing "eternal without desire"** is called **"eternal with desire"**.

Desire is **like the heart’s spontaneous inclinations that exceed measure (从心所欲不逾矩)**.
Master Zhū Wén Gōng (朱文公) also answered Master Shěn Zhuāng Zhòng (沈庄仲) this way.

**The "boundary" (徼)** is the edge, like a boundary—this is what is meant by the **point of response**.
Formerly, people would **make a single couplet of "eternal without, eternal with"**,
but it is **better to see it as "eternal without desire, eternal with desire"** alone.

If one **must insist on framing "eternal without, eternal with" as a couplet**,
then **"eternal without" risks collapsing into the rigid void of annihilation (断灭之顽空)**,
while **"eternal with" falls into the stubborn clinging of fixed dispositions (执滞之常情)**—
how could this **suffice to observe the Dao’s profound essence and function**?

Moreover, if **"eternal without" is the couplet**,
yet the following text says *"desire to observe its mystery"*—
then **in the time of "eternal without"**, how can one **also call it "desire"**?

Someone asked: *"These two—same source yet different names—
are often taken as couplets with 'them' (者), or sometimes the 'same' (同) is attached to the previous phrase—why?"*

I say: Since the **beginning of this chapter distinguishes Dao and qi (炁) by "nameless" and "named" (无名有名)**,
and then **divides essence and function by "eternal without desire" and "eternal with desire" (无欲有欲)**,
it is **only proper at the end to merge and conclude them**.

Though **Dao and qi, essence and function, are inherently distinct**,
they were **never originally separate as two distinct things**.
Only when **"the boundary" (徼) is absent**, then **Dao is without qi**; when **qi is without Dao**, then **Dao lacks a place to dwell**.
Without **essence**, **function cannot operate**; without **function**, **essence cannot be revealed**.

Dao **governs qi yet is not confined by qi**,
function **depends on essence yet truly originates from essence**—
Dao is **essence itself**, qi is **function itself**.
Since **essence and function share one source**,
and **principles and affairs are undivided**,
hence it is said: *"These two..."* and so forth.

Though **it is the boundless, void essence (冲漠无眹之体)**,
yet **the luminous functions of affairs and principles (昭然事物之用)** are **already complete**.

Though **it is the functions of all affairs and principles (事事物物之用)**,
yet **the tranquil, trace-less essence (漠然无朕之体)** does not **contradict**.

Yet **movement and stillness differ in name**,
and **principles and affairs must be divided**—
thus, **stillness, namelessness, and without desire (静而无名无欲)** is **essence**,
while **movement, namedness, and with desire (动而有名有欲)** is **function**—
hence it is called **"different names"**.

This is **essence as stillness becoming function in movement**—
**not pointing to two separate origins of movement and stillness**,
nor **placing essence and function in absolute distinction**.
Hence it is said: *"These two share the same source yet differ in name."*

Because **they share one source yet differ in name**,
they **encompass essence and function**, **thread movement and stillness**,
**mysteriously unified**, yet **leaving no trace to point to**—
this is why they are called **"the same Profound (玄) indeed"**.

「The Master Guan Yin said that which cannot be tilted or divided,
hence it is called **Heaven (天)**, **Fate (命)**, **Spirit (神)**, **Profound (玄)**—
all together, it is the **Dao/Way (道)**.

Thus, what is called **Profound (玄)** is merely a word to describe it,
and yet **it transcends stagnant attachment to the Profound (玄)**,
endlessly transforming—so profound indeed.

All under Heaven know **beauty (美)** as beauty,
and thus it becomes **ugliness (恶)**;
all know **good (善)** as good,
and thus it becomes **not-good (不善)**.

Once **names are applied (才涉定名)**,
oppositions arise.
They **interact and oppose each other (相因相轧)**,
like a cycle without end.
Thus, **the opposites of having and not-having (有无)** generate each other,
**difficult and easy (难易)** complete each other,
**long and short (长短)** define each other,
**high and low (高下)** incline toward each other,
**sounds and tones (声音)** harmonize with each other,
**before and after (前后)** follow each other.
*Harmony (和)*, with a falling tone.
These six pairs,
**arise through their mutual dependence (相因而有)**.

Therefore, the **Sage (圣人)** acts in **non-action (无为)**,
and practices **teaching without words (不言之教)**.
*Act (处)*, with a rising tone.
This **non-action (无为)**,
is simply **not favoring one extreme (一偏)**,
thus the six pairs **cannot arise (不得而有)**.

All things **act without complaint (作而不辞)**,
this is **nothing that is not done (无不为)**.

**Give birth yet do not possess (生而不有)**,
**act yet do not rely on (为而不恃)**,
**accomplish yet do not claim (功成不居)**.
This is the **great transformation of the Dao (大而化之)**.

Only because **they do not claim (不居)**,
is it that **they do not depart (不去)**.
*This (夫)*, pronounced *fú*.
Thus is the way of the **Sage (圣人)**.

Only **non-action is natural (无为自然)**,
so what is there to claim or depart from?

The **two preceding chapters (右二章)**,
Master He Shang named **"Nurturing Life (养身)"**,
this chapter **advances the scholar to the realm of forgetting both name and trace (名迹两忘)**.

Do not **exalt the virtuous (不尚贤)**,
so the people do not **contend (争)**;
do not **value hard-to-obtain wealth (难得之货)**,
so the people do not **become thieves (为盗)**;
do not **perceive what is desirable (不见可欲)**,
so the **heart does not become disordered (心不乱)**.
*Exalt the virtuous (尚贤)*, is a **name (名)**;
*value wealth (贵货)*, is **profit (利)**.
Only **without bias (无所徇)**,
does the **heart not stray outward (心不外驰)**.

What is called **not perceiving what is desirable (不见可欲)**,
is not **sealing the eyes (胶其目)** to not see,
but **to make all things before one’s eyes (万境之维乎吾前)**,
yet **not see them as desirable (不见其有可欲之处)**,
then **emotion does not cling to things (情不附物)**,
and **this heart becomes clear (此心澄然)**.

Thus, **the Sage’s governance (圣人之治)**,
**empties the heart (虚其心)**,
**fills the belly (实其腹)**,
**weakens the will (弱其志)**,
**strengthens the bones (强其骨)**.
Always **making the people without knowledge and without desire (常使民无知无欲)**,
*Strong (强)*, pronounced *qúliáng*.
**Knowledge (知)**, as the character reads.

**Emptying the heart (虚心)**,
is **forgetting both self and things (物我兼忘)**;
**filling the belly (实腹)**,
is **guarding the spirit internally (精神内守)**.
**Forgetting both self and things (物我兼忘)**,
then **concerns do not arise (虑不萌)** and **the will is naturally weakened (志自弱)**;
**guarding the spirit internally (精神内守)**,
then **the qi does not diminish (气不馁)** and **the bones are naturally strengthened (骨自强)**.
**Emptying the heart and weakening the will (虚心弱志)**,
then **the people are naturally without knowledge (民自无知)**;
**filling the belly and strengthening the bones (实腹强骨)**,
then **the people are naturally without desire (民自无欲)**.

Thus, **those who know (知者)** do not **dare to act (不敢为)**.
**Acting in non-action (为无为)**,
then **nothing remains ungoverned (无不治)**.

**The Way of Sound (夫音扶)**

**Knowing sound (知音智)**,
the **Dao/Way** of the **Sage (圣人)** is **internally applied to govern oneself (内以之治身)**,
and **externally applied to govern others (外以之治人)**—
all such.

As **Zhuangzi (庄子)** said:
*"Wander the heart in simplicity (游心於淡),
unite the qi with emptiness (合气於漠),
follow things naturally (顺物自然),
without harboring private concerns (无容私焉),*
and the **world is governed (天下治)**—
this is it.

**The following three chapters (右三章)**,
**River Upper (河上)** named **Peaceful Governance (安民)**.
This chapter speaks of **forgetting the pursuit of honor (忘贵尚)**,
and **erasing thoughts and concerns (泯思虑)**,
so that **one returns to non-action (复无为)**,
and **aligns with ultimate truth (合至理)**.

**The Dao/Way is vast yet applied (道冲而用之)**—
sometimes **it does not fill (或不盈)**.
**Profound (渊兮)**, it **seems like the origin of all things (似万物之宗)**.
**The Dao’s essence is vast and empty (道体冲虚)**,
**indifferent and without trace (漠然无朕)**,
yet **its application encompasses all without exception (而其用则无所不该)**.
Though **the greatness of heaven and earth (天地)**,
and **the abundance of movement and growth (动植)**,
all exist within it—
**it is never exhausted by their measure (亦莫盈其量矣)**.

For **form is limited (形有限)**, yet **principle is boundless (理无穷)**—
this is **the Dao’s greatness without end (道之大而无外)**,
**a treasure that never fills (宝不盈也)**.
Yet **its subtlety is also without interior (然而其细亦无内)**,
so though **a single thing or matter (一物一事)**,
**none escape its full possession (莫不各具)**, not even **a hair’s breadth (毫发不遗)**.
Thus, **one must necessarily examine this closely (必近察乎此)**,
and **not recklessly abandon the heart to empty wonder (不可一向驰心空妙)**,
lest **one seek what is called vast yet unfilling (以求其所谓大而不盈者)**—
hence **it says "sometimes" (故云或也)**.
**"Sometimes" (或)** means **doubt (疑)**.

Again, **it continues (又继之)**:
*"Profound (渊兮), it seems like the origin of all things (似万物之宗)***—
**profound (渊)** is the **name for that which is empty, clear, deep, and tranquil (虚澄深静而不可测)**.
This is **why it is called the origin of all things (所以为万物之宗)**,
**its nature inherently indefinable (本然不可定名)**—
hence **it says "seems" (故云似也)**.
For **when observing all things (即万物而观)**,
there must be **something that serves as their sovereign (必有以为之宗主者)**,
yet **in truth there is never a fixed form (而实未尝有方体也)**.

**Dull its sharpness (挫其锐)**,
**untangle its complexity (解其纷)**,
**harmonize its brilliance (和其光)**,
**unify its dust (同其尘)**.
**Serene (湛兮)**, yet **seems as if it might exist (似或存)**.
**All things possess this Dao (物莫不有是道)**,
but **only humans can fully embody it (而人独能全之)**—
thus, **the teachings of the highest Sage instruct people to cultivate it (故上圣教人修之)**,
to **attain its fullness (以极其全也)**.

**Sharpness (锐)** is **that which projects human talent and wisdom outward (人之才智外形而有芒角)**,
**complexity (纷)** is **that which entangles affairs in myriad details (事之节目繁会而盘错)**.
**Dulling (挫)** means **grinding and polishing to remove its jagged edges (磨砻以去其圭角)**,
so that **its inherent wholeness remains (而本然圆成者自若矣)**.
**Untangling (解)** is like **the butcher’s skill in dissecting (犹庖丁之理解)**—
**complexity (纷)** is **its myriad strands (其族)**.
When **it is fully severed (及乎磔然已解)**,
and **stillness is unbroken (而静一不紊)**—
**its nature remains (自若矣)**.
This is **cultivation in outward matters (修於外)**,
to **nourish what lies within (以养其中)**.

**Harmonizing its brilliance (和其光)**,
then **it shines without dazzling (光矣而不耀)**.
**Unifying its dust (同其尘)**,
then **it encompasses all things as one (磅砖万物以为一)**.
This is **unity within (一於内)** to **respond to the outside (以应其外)**—
when **it reaches its utmost (及其至也)**,
**inner and outer are as one (内外一如)**,
and **only then does the whole, undivided body reside in me (浑然之全体在我)**,
**serene and ever present (湛然常脊矣)**.
**Seems as if it might exist (似或存)**—
**it dares not be directly pointed at (不敢正指)**.
For **the Dao has no fixed form (道无定体)**,
yet **grasping at it leads to loss (执之则失矣)**.

**I do not know whose child the Dao is (吾不知谁之子)**,
yet **it precedes the Sovereign (象帝之先)**.
**The Dao is the mother of heaven, earth, and all things (道者，天地万物之母)**—
hence **it says "I do not know whose child" (故曰不知谁之子)**.
**Form (象)** is **the beginning of the tangible (有形之始)**,
**the Sovereign (帝)** is **the master of the manifest (有物之主)**.
**It precedes (先)** refers to **before there was form or manifestation (其未有形有物之前)**.

**The following four chapters (右四章)**,
**River Upper (河上)** named **The Source-less (无源)**.
This chapter **illuminates the subtle origin (明妙本)**,
**vast and empty (冲虚)**, yet **its application is unfathomable (而其用不测)**.

**Heaven and earth are not "仁" (天地不仁)**,
yet **they treat all things as fodder for horses and dogs (以万物为刍狗)**;
**the Sage is not "仁" (圣人不仁)**,
yet **they treat the people as fodder for horses and dogs (以百姓为刍狗)**.

**"仁" (仁)** is **the root of life (生之本)**,
**the principle of love (爱之理)**—
**the greatest virtue of the Three Powers (三才之大德)**.
What is called **"not仁" (不仁)** is **not clinging to仁 (不滞於仁)**,
just as **the highest virtue is not virtue (上德不德)**.

For **the constant of heaven and earth (天地之常)** is **to embrace all things universally (以其心普万物)** yet **without heart (而无心)**;
**the constant of the Sage (圣人之常)** is **to conform to all affairs (以其情顺万事)** yet **without emotion (而无情)**.
Thus, **they are not bound by present concerns (不系累於当时)**,
nor **entangled by past affections (不留情於既往)**—
like **bundling fodder for sacrificial dogs (犹束刍为狗)**,
**ceremonial rites (祭祀之仪)**,
**used at the proper time (适时而用)**,
**discarded when the ritual is done (已事而弃)**—
how could **they harbor attachment (岂容心哉)**?
This is **the utmost of selflessness (此无私之极)**,
**the peak of仁 (仁之至也)**.

Between **heaven and earth (天地之间)**,
**it is like the bellows (橐钥)**.
**Bellows (橐)**, pronounced *tú* (他各切),
**is a leather bag (鞴)**.
**Tube (钥)**, pronounced *yào* (音药),
**is a pipe (管)**—
**a thing that can receive wind and air (能受气鼓风之物)**.
Between **heaven and earth (天地之间)**,
**the two qi move in and out, bending and stretching (二气往来屈伸)**—
just as **this thing is empty yet receptive (虚而能受)**,
**responding without storing (应而不藏)**.
**Empty yet unyielding (虚而不屈)**,
**moving yet ever emerging (动而愈出)**.
**River Upper (河上)** and **Lu (陆)** both **interpret屈 as竭 (释屈作竭)**.
**Zhu Wenzhong (朱文公)** said:
*"If it does not receive a single thing (有一物之不受)**,
then **it is empty yet yielding (虚而屈)**.
If **it does not respond to a single thing (有一物之不应)**,
then **it moves yet cannot emerge (动而不能出)**.
**Many words exhaust meaning (多言数穷)**,
**better to hold fast to the center (不如守中)**."
**数 (数)**, pronounced *shuò* (音朔), means **repeatedly (屡)**.
**Sima Wengong (司马温公)** said:
*"One who can **hold fast to the center with sincerity (守中诚)***
**is believed without speech (不言而信)**."
**Su Wendingong (苏文定公)** said:
*"Seeing **its movement yet ever emerging (动而愈出)**,
**one does not know it is the response of the empty center (不知其为虚中之报)**—
hence **he tells this (故告之云云)**."

**The following five chapters (右五章)**,
**River Upper (河上)** named **The Empty Application (虚用)**.
This chapter **first cites the affairs of heaven, earth, and the Sage (先以天地圣人之事)**,
and **draws analogies from distant things (及远取诸物)**,
to **illustrate their selflessness and non-action (以明其无私无为)**.
Once **the body of the empty center is established (虚中之体既立)**,
then **its application naturally ceases not (则其用自然不息)**.
One **cannot merely follow its application (不可徒徇於用)**,
without **returning to seek its root (而不知反求其本之所以然)**—
thus **it teaches to speak little and hold fast to the center (故教之讷言守中)**,
as **the gateway to entering virtue (以为入德之门)**.

**The center (中)** is **the Dao itself (即道也)**—
**its body is round and unified with the Great Emptiness (即其体则圆同太虚)**,
**standing alone without deviation (卓然而无所偏倚)**.
**Its application flows without interruption (以其用则周流无间)**—
**in all things and matters (在於事物)**,
**it is neither excessive nor deficient (各无过不及)**.
**To hold fast (守)** is **the matter of learning to seek its utmost (学以求至者)**.
When **its functions are perfected (及乎功用纯熟)**,
**then holding fast is naturally cast aside (则守底瞥地脱落)**,
**its essence is clear (当体澄然)**,
and **the center stands firm (中斯立焉)**.

Some say **the center (中)** refers to **the Central Palace (中宫黄庭)** and **the Great Abyss of the North Pole (北极太渊)**—
meaning **to store the spirit in the Central Palace (存神中宫)**,
**so as to nourish the fetal essence (所以养胎元)**,
**and inherit the essence of the qi-mother (袭气母之要)**.
This is **also speaking of the center in terms of form and vessel (此又就形器而言中)**—
just as **the North Pole resides in the center of heaven (北极在天之中)**,
**dwelling in its place (居其所)** as **the pivot of the primal unity (为玄浑之枢纽)**,
so **the center (中)**—
**thus it is that the center can be implied and seen (于是乎有以寓而可见矣)**."

Yet the **pivot and hinge** by which it operates,
and the **Primordial Transformation** by which it never ceases,
are **indeed reliant upon the center** alone.

If one perceives it thoroughly,
then **whether spoken of as horizontal or vertical**,
it is **all contained within**.

**The Valley Spirit does not die**—this is called the **Mysterious Female**.
The **Valley Spirit** refers to **its form being void yet receptive to all things**,
while **its function responds yet remains unfathomable**.
Since it **governs the threads of transformation**,
flowing through past and future,
wondrously encompassing all things while **endlessly generating life**,
it is thus called **undying**.
This is the **true One’s essence**,
the **master of yin and yang**—
hence, the **Mysterious Female**.
This speaks of **principle inhering in qi**—
the **Mysterious Male** and the **Female Yin**.

For the **Male transforms into the Mysterious**, beyond measure,
while the **Female unites to generate endlessly**—
thus it is said.

**Master Wen** remarked:
*"The most subtle principle carries the intent of endless generation."*
Hence, **Master Cheng** adopted this teaching.

The **Gate of the Mysterious Female** is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.
The **Gate** is the **portal to all marvels**,
from which **Heaven, Earth, and all things emerge**.
The **Root** is like the root of plants—
invisible to mortals,
yet the **true source of endless generation**.
It refers to **the opening and closing of yin and yang** as the **foundation of Heaven and Earth**.
In the human body, it is the **Primordial Palace and the Female Repository**—
the **convergence of spirit and qi**,
where **Heaven and Earth share the same root**.

**Master Cao Dao-Chong** said:
*"The Mysterious is the **dim and hidden**, where the spirit is stored**.
The Female is the **gentle and harmonious**, where the qi is stored**.
**Continuous as if ever-present**,
its use requires no exertion."*

**Master Cao** further explained:
*"Continuous" means **unbroken harmony**.
The **Way values non-action**—
to call it *having* is rigidity,
to call it *not having* is dullness—
thus, it is said to be *as if ever-present*."*

**Master Wen Ding** stated:
*"Continuous—**subtle yet unbroken**.
As if ever-present—**present yet unseen**.*
He who embodies this
**need not labor even if using it all day**."*

---
**The Sixth Chapter**—*River Above, named Cheng Xiang.*
This chapter speaks of **the Dao’s essence and function**,
**the qi’s yin and yang**,
**the form’s motion and stillness**—
and how **humans embody it**.

For **only through the Mysterious Female’s endless generation**
does one **know the Valley Spirit’s immortality**.
And **only through Heaven and Earth’s constant motion and stillness**
does one **recognize the Mysterious Female’s work**.

The **Valley Spirit** is spoken of in terms of **principle**,
the **Mysterious Female** in terms of **qi**,
and **Heaven and Earth** in terms of **form**.
The **Dao’s wondrous function**
does not exceed **yin and yang**,
yet its **reason for being**
is **never dependent on yin and yang**—
rather, it **governs qi and form**, **penetrating all without obstruction**.

Someone asked:
*"The* Ling Shu *says:
*'The Heavenly Valley Spirit—guard it, and it remains true.
Above, the Mysterious; below, the Female—child and mother in harmony.
The nose is the Mysterious—drawing qi upward to connect with Heaven;
the mouth is the Female—receiving saliva downward to connect with Earth.'*
Yet you reject this teaching—why?"*

The reply:
*"This is **limited to the human body alone**,
while this chapter **traces directly to the origin of all transformations**.
The **Dao governs yin and yang**, **generates Heaven and Earth**—
yet the **governance of yin and yang** is **human nature**,
and the **qi of Heaven and Earth** is **the human body**—
thus, **near analogies from the body** reflect the same principle.
From the **mouth and nose theories**, later alchemists elaborated,
and **later scholars** made it **ever more fragmented**.
As **Zhang Ping-Shu** said:
*'The Gate of the Mysterious Female few know—
only to rely on mouth and nose in vain.
Rao the Master practiced inhalation a thousand times—
how could he grasp the Golden Rooster and Jade Rabbit?'*

**Shao Dao-Guang** wrote:
*'The Gate of the Mysterious Female—know it well,
yet few dare to begin.
You still doubt the logic of immortality—
just look between the frost and the dawn.'*

**Master Zhu** declared:
*'The Gate of the Mysterious Female is called the Golden Mother,
**Prior to Heaven and Earth, it hides the True Soil**.
**Embrace the Primordial, hold the breath—thus life is born**,
**One qi, void yet eternal through ages**.
Again, he said:
*'If mortals would recognize the True Mysterious Female,
it is **not in the heart nor in the kidneys**.
**Trace the origin of life’s received qi**—
do not blame the **Heavenly Mechanism** for leaking entirely.'*

**Master Lü Chongyang** composed:
*'The Gate of the Mysterious Female is hard to speak of—
from ancient times, here **Kun and Qian** unite.
The **Hall of Jade** is called the **Communing Sage**,
the **Golden Pit** is the **Mysterious Principle**.
Its use is like **the Sun’s spirit entering the Moon’s body**,
its arrival like **the sea’s pulse surging as a spring tide**.
Once the mechanism is understood, all is effortless—
**a youth roams ten thousand miles, unbound**.'*

Though these **alchemical schools** consider it the **ultimate marvel**,
their **core intent** has already been **expressed in the preface**.

*The Liezi* records:
*"The Yellow Emperor’s text says..."*—
**fully quoting this entire chapter**.
For **ancient texts existed**, yet **Laozi only transmitted them**.
And **Master Ge Xian Gong’s** *Inner Transmission* states:
*"In the Yellow Emperor’s time, the Old Master was Guangchengzi,
who expounded this scripture for the Emperor—
thus the Emperor recorded it, citing this chapter."*

---
**Heaven endures, Earth persists.**
**Heaven and Earth endure long**
because **they do not generate themselves**—
thus they **endure in generation**.
**The non-generating is the source of generation**—
hence, **"endless generation"** refers to **the non-generating**.

All **adornments of form and number**
must have **limits and measures**.
Yet when it is said that **"Heaven endures, Earth persists"**
it is **only from the perspective of mortal sight**.

Thus, the **Sage** **delays the self** yet **the self precedes**;
**abandons the self** yet **the self is preserved**.
This is **bending oneself to forget the ego**—
**not for private gain or selfish profit**,
but the **natural unfolding of principle and circumstance**.
For **humility brings radiance**,
**forgetting the form brings longevity**.
Is this not **selflessness**?
Thus, **private concerns are fulfilled**.

The **Heavenly and Earthly** do not vie with things for life,
the **Sage** does not contend with others for virtue—
thus they **transcend mortals**.

The **most impartial principle** is unalterable and enduring—
this is the **Way of lastingness**.

**Chapter Eight**—*Riverbank* names it **"Concealing One’s Brilliance."**
This chapter elucidates the **doctrine of selflessness**—
the **Dao of enduring**.

**The highest excellence is like water.**
Water excels in benefiting all things yet does not contend—
what mortals despise is **closest to the Dao**.

*处 (chǔ)*, upper tone.
*恶 (wù)*, departing tone.
*几 (jī)*, near—**almost**.

To **guard softness and dwell low** is what the vulgar despise,
yet truly **closest to the Dao**.
But if adorned with form, it **falls short of the Dao**—
hence, **"almost."**

To **dwell well** is to **humble oneself** and **nurture the self**—
like descending to the lowly.

To **cultivate the heart’s depth**—
stillness brings clarity and emptiness—
these are all **first preserving one’s essence**.

Only with **humility, modesty, and tranquil depth** as virtue
do the five functions unfold.

**To give generously**—
to **share with emptiness yet not with fullness**,
to **broadly bestow without seeking return**—
this is **selflessness alone**.

**To speak well**—
sincere words **need no oaths to align**,
like tides that **never fail**—
when blocked, they cease; when released, they flow,
discerning beauty and ugliness without error,
traversing perilous paths without loss.

**To govern well**—
to **rectify conduct and awaken others**,
to **cleanse stillness and transform the people**—
like a level measure **purifying all filth**.

**To act well**—
to **adapt to change and fulfill duties**,
each fitting its capacity—
like clay shaped to round or square,
bearing loads light or heavy,
avoiding obstacles and seeking passage—
never stagnating in one form.

**To move well**—
to **act and rest with the times**—
like spring thawing and winter freezing.

Only because they **do not contend**,
they **incur no blame**.
With **virtue and merit yet no contention**,
this is the **apex of excellence**—
thus, **what fault remains?**

*尤 (yóu)*, error; resentment.

**Chapter Eight**—*Riverbank* names it **"Changing Nature."**
This chapter uses **water to illustrate highest excellence**,
clarifying the **conduct of non-contention**.

**To grasp and fill** is not as good as **letting go**;
**to sharpen and hone** cannot be **long preserved**.

「已（yǐ）音以（yīn yǐ），止（zhǐ）也。
**To stop** is to **abide in stillness**—
**to rest** is to **abide in stillness**.

揣（chuǎi），初委切（chū wěi qiè），治（zhì）也。
**To probe**—initially yielding, then **to refine**—
**to test and temper** is **to refine**.

文定曰：知盈之必溢而以持固之，不若不盈之安也。
**Wén Dìng** says:
**To know that fullness will overflow** and yet **to cling and constrain it**—
this is **not as good as letting it remain unfilled** for **serene stability**.

知说之必折而以揣先之，不如揣之不可必恃也。
**To know that sharpness will break** and yet **to probe and force it prematurely**—
this is **not as good as letting it blunt naturally**, for **it cannot be relied upon**.

若夫圣人无积，尚安有盈？
**Yet the Sage** has **no accumulation**—
how then could there ever be **overflow**?

循理而行，尚安有锐？
**Following the Dao/Way in action**—
how then could there ever be **sharpness**?

无盈则无所用持，无锐则无所用揣矣。
**Without overflow**, there is **no need to cling**;
**without sharpness**, there is **no need to probe**.

金玉满堂，莫之能守；
**Though gold and jade fill the halls**—
none can **preserve them**.

富贵而骄，自遗其咎。
**Though wealthy and honored, if proud**—
one **invites its own blame**.

功成，名遂，身退，天之道。
**When achievements are complete**, **repute is fulfilled**—
**to withdraw oneself** is the **Dao/Way of Heaven**.

遗（wèi），唯季切（wéi jì qiè），贻（yí）也。
**To leave behind**—

如刘泾曰：黄帝云：动以营生谓之魂。
As **Liú Jīng** says:
**The Yellow Emperor** declared:
**"To move while nurturing life is called the soul (hún)."**

**Bì Xū** said:
**"The vital essence (yíng) is the soul (hún)."**

**"The vital essence (yíng) is the form of restless fluctuation."**

载（zài），乘（chéng）也。

文定曰：圣人性定而神凝，
**Wén Dìng** says:

**not swayed by things**, though **the spirit is the dwelling**—

而神欲行，魄无不从，
**when the spirit wishes to move**, the **spirit never fails to follow**—

then **the spirit always rides upon the essence**.

众人以物役性，神昏而不治，
**Common folk let things enslave their nature**—
their **spirit grows dim and unrefined**—

则神听於魄。
then **the spirit submits to the essence**.

耳目用於声色，口鼻劳於臭味。
**Eyes and ears are used for sounds and colors**—
**mouth and nose are strained by smells and tastes**.

魄所欲行而神从之，则魄常载神矣。
**Where the essence wishes to move**, the **spirit follows**—
then **the essence always rides upon the spirit**.

故教之以抱神载魄，使两者不相离也。
Thus **the teaching is to embrace the spirit and ride upon the essence**—
**to ensure the two never separate**.

文公曰：以车承人谓之载，
**Wén Gōng** says:
**"To bear" means to let a carriage support a person**—
this is **common parlance**.

以人登车亦谓之载，则古文史类多有之。
**To let a person ascend a carriage** is also called **"to bear"**—
many ancient texts use this **metaphor**.

如《汉纪》云：刘章从谒者与载。
As in the *Hàn Jì*:
**"Liú Zhāng followed the attendants and rode."**

韩集云：妇人以孺子载。
The *Hán Jí* states:
**"A woman carried a child."**

盖皆此意。
**All follow this meaning**.

营者，字与荧同，而为晶明光炯之意。
**The vital essence (yíng)**—
its character is the same as *yíng* (as in "radiance")—
but it means **clear and luminous**.

其所谓魄，亦若予论於《九歌》耳。
**The spirit (pò)**—
this is as **I discussed in the *Jiǔ Gē* (Nine Songs)**.

盖以魂阳动而魄阴静，
**For the soul is yang and active**, while **the spirit is yin and still**—

魂火二、而魄水一，
**the soul is like two flames**, while **the spirit is like one water**—

谓以魂加魄，以动守静，
**meaning to let the soul govern the spirit**—
**to let the active preserve the still**—

以火迫水，以二守一，
**to let fire press upon water**—
**to let the dual guard the singular**—

而不相离，如人登车而常载於其上，
**without separation**, like a **person ascending a carriage**—
**always riding upon it**—

则魂安静而魄精明，
then **the soul is tranquil** while **the spirit is refined**—

火不燥而水不缢，
**the flames do not scorch** and **the water does not dry**—

固长生久视之要也。

But those who explain it fail to delve deeply. When **Hé Shàng Gōng** takes *yíng* as the soul, this is not only incorrect in terms of the character’s meaning, but he also speaks of a person carrying the soul and spirit upon a carriage to attain life, urging their care—this is also a misinterpretation of the text’s intent. Only his understanding of the character *zài* (載) is roughly correct.

If **Wáng Fǔsì** takes *zài* to mean "to reside," and regards *yíng-pò* as the place where a person habitually dwells, this is also in line with Hé Shàng’s view. Yet in later times, **Sū Shìyóu** and **Wáng Yuànzé** offered their own interpretations. **Hóng Qìngshàn** also claimed that when yang-qi fills the spirit, it becomes the soul, and if the soul can move, life is preserved. Yet all these interpretations take *zài* to mean "to carry a person upon a carriage," which not only contradicts the text’s meaning but would also force the spirit to labor constantly while the soul never rests. Though one might avoid the burdens of material desires, in the depths of obscurity, the refined unity of essence would instead be seized by excessive yang, driving it through chaotic and entangled paths—ultimately falling into the realm where ordinary people harm their vitality and shorten their lives, unaware.

In *Jiǔ Gē Biànzhèng*, someone asked about the meaning of soul and spirit, and replied:
**Zǐ Chǎn** said: *"When a thing first takes form, it is called spirit (pò); once born, the spirit becomes yang and is called soul (hún)."*
**Confucius** said: *"Qi is the manifestation of the spirit."*
*"The spirit is the essence of the ghost."*
**Zhèng Xī’s commentary** states: *"The inhaling and exhaling is qi. The clarity of the ears and eyes is the spirit. Qi is what is called the soul."*

*The Huáinánzǐ* says: *"Heavenly qi is the soul; earthly qi is the spirit."*
**Gāo Yòu’s commentary** explains: *"The soul is the yang-spirit of man; the spirit is the yin-spirit of man."*
These several explanations elaborate the meaning of soul and spirit well.

Indeed, when it says *"a thing first takes form"* (物生始化), it means that at the moment of receiving form, when vital essence and blood gather, the luminous aspect among them is called *spirit*. When it says *"once born, the spirit becomes yang and is called soul"* (既生魄阳曰魂), it means that once the spirit is born, there arises a warm vitality, and the divine aspect among them is called *soul*. Only when these two unite does a thing come into being—this is what the *Yì* means by *"refined qi forms things."*

When they disperse, the soul wanders as spirit, and the spirit descends as ghost. Yet those who explain it do not consider this, and merely rely on **Zuǒ Zhū’s commentary**, which divides the divine and luminous into yin and yang. Though this seems reasonable, to take the inhaling and exhaling as the spirit is incorrect. His statement that *"the luminous attached to form is the spirit, the divine attached to qi is the soul"* is closer to the truth, but his claim that *"the spirit’s cognition is limited while the soul’s cognition is vast"* is wrong. They merely differ in their functions of movement and storage.

**Yáng Zhīzhōng** further explains this through the luminosity of the sun and moon, asserting that the moon’s substance is the spirit, while the sun’s radiance is the soul. He says the sun’s light illuminates the moon’s spirit, just as a person ascends a carriage and rides upon it. Hence, *"when the moon is not yet full, the spirit is carried westward."* When full, *"the spirit terminates eastward,"* tending toward the sun. This means that when the moon is waxing, the sun’s light shines upon the spirit’s western side, gradually filling its eastern side until it reaches fullness. Once full, the sun’s light guards the spirit’s eastern side, gradually diminishing its western side until it wanes and vanishes. The moon’s brilliance depends on its proximity to the sun—before fullness, the sun is to its right; after fullness, to its left. Thus, it faces whichever direction the light comes from, like the people turning toward their ruler’s transformation to form customs. This is the doctrine of soul and spirit.

*"Thirty spokes converge at one hub; though the hub is empty, it fulfills the carriage’s use."*
**Fú** (輻) is pronounced *fú*, and **gǔ** (毂) is the hollow center of the wheel, made of many hard woods. **Gǔ** is pronounced *gǔ* (古木切), meaning the outer part where all spokes meet, hollow inside to receive the axle as its pivot. **Dāng** (當) is pronounced *dāng* (丁浪切), meaning "just so." The "empty" refers to the hollow space, meaning that the spokes and hub combine to form a carriage, and it is this central void that makes the carriage functional. **Wén Gōng** said: *"The empty is the hollow within the hub."* Only because it is empty within can it receive the axle and turn endlessly. This is what **Zhuāngzǐ** meant when he said: *"The pivot begins to find its circular center, responding to the boundless."*

*"Mixing clay to make a vessel: though it is empty, it fulfills the vessel’s use."*
**Suō** (埏) is pronounced *suō* (始然切), meaning "to blend earth," and **zhí** (埴) is pronounced *zhí* (市力切), meaning "sticky clay"—both are the work of potters. This too relies on the vessel’s inner emptiness to contain things, making it a useful vessel. The meaning below is the same.

*"Piercing doors and windows to make a room: though it is empty, it fulfills the room’s use."*
**Záo** (凿) means "to bore." A half-door is called *hù* (户), and a window beside the door is called *yǒu* (牖). Thus, what is "having" is for convenience, while what is "empty" is for function. These three things all have outer forms to take shape, yet are hollow within to receive things. The outer form brings timely benefit, while the inner emptiness holds true, constant use. Without the empty, there would be no way to apply its benefit; without the having, there would be no way to achieve its function. Thus, form and spirit rely on each other, and having and emptiness complement one another. Yet the one who governs form and directs qi is always in the empty—this is how wondrous transformations arise, and utility is endless.

The *Yì* says: *"If the Heaven and Earth were destroyed, there would be no way to see the *Yì*; if the *Yì* were unseen, Heaven and Earth might nearly cease to exist."* This conveys the same meaning.

**Eleven chapters have been discussed.**
**Hé Shàng** named this chapter *"The Use of the Non-Use."*

This chapter elucidates the wondrous interplay of having and emptiness, dispelling the confusion of one-sided extremes.

Five colors make the eyes blind;
Five tones make the ears deaf;
Five flavors make the palate lose its true taste.
**Lìng** (令) is pronounced *lìng* (令, all level tones), meaning "to cause."
**Shuǎng** (爽) means "to lose," referring to the loss of the genuine, unadulterated taste.

Hunting and galloping across fields drive one’s mind to madness—
this is when *qi* reverses and agitates the heart.
Though the will may move *qi* nineteen times out of twenty,
this chapter speaks of all that which, coming from without, bewilders us.
Thus it instructs us to master the external so as to tranquilize the inner.

Rare and coveted goods disrupt one’s conduct.
*"Conduct"* is pronounced *xíng* (行, departing tone).
Rare and coveted goods are all external things.
*"Disrupt"* means to harm.
When the heart clings to externals, it obstructs virtuous conduct.
Therefore, the Sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes,
and thus discards the former to embrace the latter.
*"Discards"* (去), pronounced *qù* (mouth-ju, to scatter), here means to remove—
not the *qù* (去) of departure.
The belly contains within yet desires nothing;
the eyes chase what appears without and lure the inner.
To act for the belly is akin to the *Gèn* (艮) meaning of "ease and retreat";
not to act for the eyes aligns with the *Yīnfú* (阴符) saying, *"The mechanism lies in the eyes."*

**Chapter Twelve**
*Hé Shàng* named this *"Frugality in Desire."*
This chapter clarifies how attachment to dust and pursuit of phenomena
all lead one astray from the true Way.
For the previous chapter spoke of the boundless wonders of emptiness within,
here it warns against being filled by external evils.
Its essence lies in the eyes—
thus it begins and ends with them,
as with the six senses and six dusts, where *eye-color* ranks first.
The Master’s *"Four Do Nots"* (四勿) must first say *"Do not gaze"*—
all of this meaning is the same.

Yet the eyes must see, the ears must hear,
the mouth must taste, the form must labor,
the heart must respond—
these cannot be stilled.
Only when movement never departs from stillness
does one, though moving, not cling to things,
and thus attain serene desirelessness.

Honor and disgrace strike like alarms;
wealth and great calamity press like the body itself.
To gain honor is disgrace;
honor is the root of disgrace—
only after honor does disgrace arise,
hence it is called *"the lesser."*
To receive it is like an alarm;
to lose it is like an alarm—
this is called *"honor and disgrace striking like alarms."*
If not aligned with the Way,
then gain and loss burden the heart like bells,
and thus one is alarmed.

What is meant by *"wealth and great calamity press like the body itself"*?
The reason I have great calamity is that I have a body.
When I have no body, what calamity do I have?
*"For"* is pronounced *wèi* (去, departing tone).
This again speaks of the body as the root of wealth and calamity—
without a body, one forgets the self.
The previous did not reach disgrace,
this did not reach wealth—
it is mutual phrasing to convey the meaning,
and since no one fails to love wealth or hate calamity,
it speaks only of calamity.
This stems from the persistence of the *self-view*;
if one could abandon the self,
then naturally wealthy one walks in wealth,
naturally afflicted one endures affliction—
smooth and rugged are as one,
pleasure and pain are equal—
then who would further bear wealth or calamity?

Thus, to hold wealth as the body is to entrust it with the world;
to love the body as the world is to commit the world to it.
Guó Xiàng says:
*"If one lightly discards the body to pursue gain,
abandons the self to serve things,
then the body itself cannot be secure—
how much less the world?"*
It means one must truly cherish and love the body
before one can be entrusted with the world.
Yet wealth does not reach the depth of love,
and entrustment does not last as long as commitment.
Some say: *"To know how to cherish and love the body
is to transcend the world."*

**Chapter Thirteen**
*Hé Shàng* named this *"Loathing Shame."*
This chapter clarifies how to discard false emotions
and restore the true nature.
If one abandons honor, disgrace does not reach;
if one forgets the body, calamity does not come.
The world is a great thing—
yet even it is not a burden,
how much less other things?
But to forget the body is the study of the transcendent.
One who cherishes and loves the body
yet does not let the world be a burden
is not one bound by the *Huánghù* (yellow-roofed palace).

What is unseen when gazed upon is called *yí* (夷);
the great symbol is level and smooth, without visible color.
What is unheard when listened to is called *xī* (希);
the great sound is subtle and silent, beyond hearing.
What cannot be grasped is called *wēi* (微).
*"Grasp"* is pronounced *bó* (伯各).
Subtle and formless, it is empty and cannot be held.
These three cannot be forced or questioned,
so they merge into one.

*"Question"* is pronounced *jié* (契吉).
The Dao is not reachable by sight, hearing, wisdom, or strength—
it must be returned to unity before it can be attained.
Above, it is not bright;
below, it is not dim.
*"Bright"* is pronounced *jiǎo* (古晓).
It means that though above it does not add clarity,
and though below it does not add obscurity,
it is taut yet nameless,
returning to nothingness.
Though taut like a cord, unbroken in motion,
it is truly without substance to name.

This is called the *form of no-form*,
the *symbol of no-symbol*—
this is called *huǎnghǔ* (恍惚).
Wén Dìng says:
*"Form"* refers to its manifestation,
*"symbol"* to its subtlety.
Since it is neither having nor not-having,
and having and not-having cannot be fixed in name,
it is called *huǎnghǔ*.

Approach it and you see no head;
follow it and you see no tail.
Only because it lacks form and color yet flows boundlessly without end
is it impossible to grasp or follow.

To hold the ancient Dao
and govern the present *you* (有),
to know the ancient beginning
is called the *memorial of the Way*.
Time has ancient and present,
the Dao has no end or beginning.
The Sage teaches people to embody the Dao
to govern the body and master things—
that is, to take the *you* of things
and trace it back to its original *wu* (无),
thus grasping its root and unifying its lineage.

**Chapter Fourteen**
*Hé Shàng* named this *"Praising the Mysterious."*
This chapter speaks of the Dao’s supreme subtlety thus:
If one hears without sound emerging,
sees without transcending color,
then unless one is deluded and clinging to things,
one must abandon *you* and cling to *wu*.
Thus it repeatedly elucidates the meaning of neither approaching nor departing,
urging one to delve deeply and attain it oneself.

The virtuous scholars of antiquity
were subtle, mysterious, and profound—
deep beyond recognition.
Wén Dìng says:
*"Coarse exhaustion leads to subtlety,
subtlety to profundity,
profundity to mystery,
mystery then flows through all without measure."*

**Chapter Fifteen**
For that which is beyond recognition,
one must forcefully give it form:
**Reverent** as one who treads a winter river,
**Cautious** as one who fears the four neighbors.

**Reverent** (豫) is to forestall calamity before it arises,
moving with hesitation as though compelled by necessity—
the utmost in vigilance.
**Cautious** (犹) is to harbor doubt in matters already done,
like one who cultivates virtue in secret,
then conceals himself in obscurity—
the deepest in restraint.

**Dignified** as a guest,
Wén Gōng says: *"Dignified as a guest"*—
the phrasing is most precise.
Later editions often errantly render this as *"form"* (容),
utterly missing the original intent.
Moreover, these seven lines form three rhyming couplets,
and *"guest"* (客) aligns perfectly with *"release"* (释).
For whenever it says *"as if"* (若某),
there is always a tangible reality beneath—
the *"guest"* is he who does not presume to be master,
yet remains involved in affairs,
thus his bearing is dignified.

**Dissolved** as ice about to melt,
exteriorly composed yet interiorly expansive—
dissolved and unconstrained by things.

**Sincere** as uncarved wood,
pure and undifferentiated,
its edges not exposed.

**Vast** as a valley,
broad yet accommodating,
empty yet responsive.

**Turbulent** as muddy water,
blended with the dust—
stirring the mud while raising the waves,
lost in the Dao’s ultimate mystery.

Who can settle the muddy with slow stillness to reveal clarity?
Who can remain at ease while in motion to nurture life?
Those who let things muddle their nature,
must only stillness to clarify it,
then their innate purity will slowly return.

Those who dwell in quiescence,
must only be at ease while capable of change,
then they will not stagnate in one corner
and life will slowly emerge.

Thus, they move and rest with lively spontaneity,
forgetting both motion and stillness.

The true keepers of this Dao
do not desire fullness.
For only the unfull can endure wear,
without seeking new perfection.

**Yuè Zhù’s commentary** says:
*"Great brightness seems like shame,
abundant virtue seems like insufficiency."*

To nurture modesty and restraint to the end—
this is what people find difficult,
so again it warns against pride and self-satisfaction—
its meaning is profound.

Only by lacking self-satisfaction
can one always preserve the worn,
without claiming credit for new achievements.

*Hé Shàng* named this *"Manifesting Virtue/Power"* (显德).
This chapter’s lines are sequentially ordered,
with the principle of *"fulfillment"* (成) as master,
and *"as if worn"* (若敝) as its exhaustion.
Like **Liezi** dwelling in the **Jīng Garden** for forty years,
without anyone recognizing him—
this is precisely the state described.

**Examine** the winds of the **Western Jin**—
how could such a spirit ever exist?

**Attain emptiness to its utmost**,
**hold fast to stillness with sincerity**—
emptiness and stillness forgotten,
this is called *"sincerity’s utmost"* (笃极).

All things arise together,
I observe their return.
Things are myriad and diverse,
each returning to its root.
**Myriad and diverse** (芸芸) is the appearance of motion.
Emptiness is the root of reality,
stillness is the root of motion—
all things arise from nature,
all return to nature.
Returning to the root is stillness,
stillness is called *"restoring the vital breath"* (复命).

Stillness is the nature of Heaven,
the vital breath given to me as such.
Yet when responding to things,
it moves.

Only by harmonizing motion and stillness
does motion never stray from stillness,
and one restores their original Heavenly nature.

Wén Dìng says:
*"If one cannot yet restore themselves to nature,*
even by ceasing motion and halting thought to seek stillness,
this is not stillness.*
Thus only returning to the root
can be called stillness.*

**Vital breath** (命) is nature’s subtlety.
The *Yì* says:
*"Exhausting principles, attaining nature’s subtlety, reaching vital breath"*—
this is it.

**Restoring vital breath** (复命) is called *"constant"* (常).
No thing can remain constant,
yet when one reaches vital breath,
it abides serenely and eternally.

**Knowing constant** (知常) is called *"clarity"* (明).
To grasp this,
then clarity is attained.
To not know constant,
is reckless action—
disaster.
To know constant is to be **comprehensive** (容).

To perceive the original essence,
then distinctions merge and barriers dissolve—
what cannot be contained?

**Comprehensive** (容) is **impartial** (公).
Who then would be private?
**Impartial** (公) is **sovereign** (王).

Wén Dìng says:
*"The world will then return to it."*

**Sovereign** (王) is **Heaven** (天).
Huáng Mào Cái says:
*"The sovereign learns from Heaven."*

**Heaven** (天) is **Dao/Way** (道).
Heaven follows the Dao.

---

Wén Dìng says:
*"Heaven still has form,
yet when one reaches Dao/Way, it attains its utmost.
Dao/Way is enduring—
to labor with the body without peril.
Liú Jìng says:
*'This is what has always existed since antiquity.'*

**Chapter XVII** — *Hé Shàng* names it *"Returning to Root."*
This chapter states:
When one awakens to this Dao,
one can be empty and tranquil,
and thus merge with Dao/Way in essence.

The **Supreme Primordial** (太上):
The lower knows its existence.
In the **Supreme Primordial** of ancient times,
the ruler was like a standard branch,
and the people like wild deer—such was their state.

The next stage:
They were cherished and praised—
this is binding people through *ren* (仁) and *yì* (义).

The next stage:
They were feared and insulted—
this is subduing people through wisdom and strength.

Thus, when trust is insufficient,
distrust arises.
If I truly trust myself,
then governing the world through Dao/Way is enough.
Only when self-trust is insufficient
do we then reinforce it with exhortations and rewards,
and press it with laws and governance—
then the people begin to harbor distrustful hearts.

Ah! How precious is speech.
When deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,
the common folk will say, *"It was natural."*

If one values naturalness and the people submit to effortless transformation,
then the governance of the **Great Antiquity** can be restored—
thus it is said that *sound and color in civilizing the people*
are but superficial.

**Chapter XVIII** — *Hé Shàng* names it *"Refined Winds."*
This chapter praises the effortless transformation of the **Great Antiquity**
while warning of the daily decline of customs.

When the **Great Dao** is abandoned,
*ren* and *yì* emerge;
when wisdom arises,
great deceit follows;
when the six kins are discordant,
filial piety and kindness appear;
when the state is chaotic and confused,
loyal ministers arise.

The grandeur of the **Great Dao**,
the substance of the seven virtues—
they lie hidden within,
yet the people remain unaware.
This is what is meant by *"pure and unblemished"*—
who would then need sacrificial vessels?

Yet sacrificial vessels are not separate from purity and simplicity—
they are merely the products of emerging wisdom and deceit.

Wén Dìng says:
*"Emperor Yáo was not unfilial,
yet he alone extolled Shùn—
there were no blind historians.
The Duke of Zhoū was not disloyal,
yet he alone extolled Lóng Fēng and Bǐ Gān—
there were no tyrants like Jié and Zhòu."*

**Chapter XIX** — *Hé Shàng* names it *"Restoring Purity."*
This chapter extols the winds of simplicity and purity,
discarding the burdens of private desires—
its benefits are vast.

The *Yīn Shù Jīng* says:
*"Cutting off one source of profit,
one needs tenfold the use of force."*
So it is.

Some say *"absolute"* (絶) is not *"to utterly discard"* (去絶),
but rather *"to reach its utmost, beyond mortal attainment."*

One must utterly abandon wisdom
before discarding private cleverness—
the lower ranks agree.

To abandon learning is to have no worries.
To attain Dao/Way is to forget its articulation—
effortlessly unburdened.

How far apart are *"yes"* (唯) and *"ah"* (阿)?
*"Yes"* (唯) — pronounced *wéi shuǐ*, its tone respectful and reverent.
*"Ah"* (阿) — pronounced *wū hé*, its tone lofty and arrogant.

How far apart are *"good"* and *"evil"*?
What one fears,
one must truly fear.

If one has not yet reached the stage of abandoning learning,
one must know that this mind is serenely effortless—
before good and evil arise,
it is the undivided original essence,
the most upright and virtuous.

When one inclines toward good or evil,
these are movements.
Yet the body cannot help but respond—
thus one must scrutinize the moment of sensation and response.

*"Respect"* and *"good"* originate from the rectitude of principle;
*"arrogance"* and *"evil"* sink into the private *qi* of form.
Between these two,
the distance is as thin as a hair—
yet Heaven’s principle and human desires are divided.

Desire is easily swayed—
no one is exempt.
This is why one must fear it.

If one can examine it with precision,
choose with discernment,
guard it firmly,
and nurture it thoroughly—
until movement is without movement,
stillness is without stillness—
then even with infinite responses,
one remains serene and luminous,
pure in Heaven’s principle,
utterly without opposition—
what then of arrogance and evil?

Ah! Its vastness knows no end.
Its grandeur is boundless, its shores unknown—
for it never leans toward one side of respect or arrogance.

「The multitude bustles and rejoices,
like feasting on the grandest sacrificial meats,
like ascending to the Spring Platform.
Yet I alone stand in dread—
its signs not yet revealed—
like an infant before it learns to speak.

*Dread* is *white-ge* (báigé), the state of stillness.
As the heart and eyes traverse the world,
external things flourish in their splendor,
and one follows them moment by moment,
unaware of their falsity.

Only the Sage of Highest Clarity sees through their delusion,
encountering them with indifference and unmoved,
like an infant not yet taught to grasp,
for its heart clings to nothing.

*Buoyant* and unrestrained—
as though it had no place to return to.
Zao said: *"To ride the myriad things in their course,
without attachment or hindrance."*

While others all have excess,
I alone seem abandoned—
*abandoned* is *forgotten*,
yet it is as though I have and have not.

Ah! My heart is that of a foolish man—
pure and unadulterated.

Yu’s annotation says:
*"The natural Dao does not manifest,
yet silently aligns with the Way—
this is called Great Wisdom."*

The vulgar shine brightly—
I alone seem dim.
The vulgar are keenly discerning—
I alone am *muted* and *spacious*.
*Shining brightly* is the radiance that dazzles the eyes,
*dim* is to not distinguish.
*Keenly discerning* is clarity without self-display,
*muted* (mèn), with the sound of *mo-bun* (mòbēn), is spaciousness.

*Vast* and *unbounded*—
like the sea, *billowing* without end.
*Billowing* (liáo), with the force of *li-you* (lìyōu), is the state of long winds swaying.

The depths hold stillness to contain all things—
thus the perfect unity of the whole.
Change and movement without rest—
thus the wondrous flow of Great Function.

While others all have their uses,
I alone am *stubborn* and *crude*.
*Uses* are *functions*.
*Stubborn* (wǎn) is ignorance,
*crude* (bǐ) is rusticity.
All know the use of function,
yet none know the use of *non-function*.

I alone differ from others,
valuing *food from the Mother*.
Wen Ding said: *"The Dao is the Mother of all things.*
Others follow things and forget the Dao,
but the Sage abandons all things,
taking the Dao as his ultimate refuge—
like an infant seeking nourishment from its Mother."*

---

**Chapter 21** – *He Shang* names it *Empty Heart*.
This chapter reveals the true Dao,
grasping the constant nature of all things.

*Flexibility* brings completeness.
The Sage of Highest Clarity aligns with heart and aligns with Dao—
whether bent or straight,
it is only the rightness of purpose that ensures the Dao is fully realized.

If one abides in the changes of time,
then bending the self preserves the Dao.
Only by bending can one avoid clashing with things,
keeping the body whole within,
and the world whole without.

*Crookedness* brings straightness.
Crookedness is what makes straightness possible—
the inchworm’s curl to seek its stretch.

*Lowliness* brings fullness.
*Lowliness* (wā), with the sound of *wu-guā* (wūguā), is *hollow*—
like the earth’s depths receiving water,
for humility invites benefit.

*Decay* brings renewal.
Darkness giving way to daily radiance.
*Little* brings attainment—
the Dao is singular.
To attain the One is to attain all.
Thus, within the utmost simplicity,
the fullness of its essence is realized,
its marvelous function complete in every way.

*Excess* brings confusion.
All matters with too many paths lead to confusion.
Therefore the Sage embraces the One
as the model for all under Heaven.

This is to follow the Dao’s transformations with time,
yet to hold to humility and simplicity as the core.
The Sage alone embraces the One
as the eternal standard for all ages—
for to embrace the One is to realize the Dao in its entirety.

He does not display himself—
thus he is luminous.
He does not affirm himself—
thus he is manifest.
He does not boast of himself—
thus he has merit.
He does not exalt himself—
thus he endures.

Only by not contending,
does he make all under Heaven unable to contend with him.
*Display* (xiàn), with the sound of *xing-diàn* (xìngdiàn), is *to show*.
This teaches the scholar how to cultivate *virtue*.

For to embrace the One is to have no self—
if he still displays himself, affirms himself, boasts of himself, or exalts himself,
then his self-perception has not been forgotten—
how then can he speak of the One?»

When one attains the realm of *no-self*,
then naturally luminous and vast,
ever fresh with time—
mind and *dharma* merge, self and others both extinguished—
what contention remains?

The ancients spoke of *"curved then whole"*—
was this mere idle talk?
Truly whole, and thus returned.

For Laozi, though obscured, did not compose—
his words *"curved then whole"* and such
were the ancient texts.
This further confirms their truth,
urging deeply.

If the scholar truly exhausts the *Way* of yielding and bending,
then the *Way’s* fullness
is indeed all returned to him.
The *Way* is inherently human—
thus *"returned,"* meaning restored to its origin.

Thus, his straightness and fullness are profound.

---
**Chapter Twenty-Two**
*Riverbank Benefit-Humility* demonstrates
the *virtue* of yielding compliance,
perfecting harmony.

*Xi* (希) speaks of naturalness.
The *Classic* says: *"Listening yet not hearing is called xi."*
The Sage’s words arise from *xi*,
all from their naturalness—
thus enduring without exhaustion.

Duke Wen said: *"The virtuous do not speak yet are believed—
thus natural."*

Hence, gusting winds do not last till morning,
sudden rains do not last till evening.
Gusting winds are the frenzied, swift winds;
sudden rains are the violent, abrupt rains.
This is the collision of *yin* and *yang*,
a sudden transformation.

Yet they cannot overcome the natural tranquility,
so they cannot endure.
From dawn till noon is *"till morning,"*
from dawn till dusk is *"till evening."*
Who does this?
Heaven and Earth.
Even Heaven and Earth cannot endure—
how much less can mortals?

If one reverses the natural,
it is not natural.
Though arising from Heaven and Earth,
it cannot endure—
how much less from mortals?

Yet Heaven and Earth also cannot always be natural,
so mortals—
how could they escape loss?

Thus those who cultivate the *Way*
must cultivate the *Way* of naturalness,
keeping their hearts steadfast,
to embody the *Way’s* workings—
thus joyful in giving and skilled in guiding,
with no distinctions to make.

The *Way* aligns with the *Way*—
this is the path of the easy-walker.
Yet even the Sage’s innate wisdom
still relies on learning to perfect the *Way*.
Thus, *"virtue does not stand alone—
it must have companions,"*
and so aligns with the *Way*.

*Virtue* aligns with *virtue*—
this is the path of the beneficial-doer.
Learning and seeking to gain for oneself.

The lost align with the lost—
this is the path of the striving-doer.
For though one’s innate *qi* may be flawed,
one’s nature is never truly different—
thus, align and transform with them.

Align with the *Way*, and the *Way* is gained;
align with *virtue*, and *virtue* is gained;
align with loss, and loss is gained.
Though their inherent endowments differ,
their reception must diverge.
Yet if one aligns and transforms them,
when gained, the result is the same.

*"Faith insufficient, there is doubt."*

Yet when the sincerity of self-*virtue* does not reach its fullest extent,
one doubts because of their flaws,
thus falling into the affliction of *unfaith*.

If *unfaith* arises,
even when aligning with them,
one cannot transform them either.

Only when one deeply cultivates and attains self-*virtue*
does one stand firmly in the realm of *unfaith’s absence*.

**Chapter Twenty-Three**—*River Above* names it *Emptiness-Nothingness*.
This chapter illustrates that the *Dao* of Nature can endure eternally,
yet though it is most effortless to attain,
it is difficult to guard.
Hence, though the heavens and earth are vast,
if they lose their constancy,
they too cannot endure—
how much more so for mortals!

In mortals, their *nature* is inherently the same,
but their *qi* and constitution differ.
If one is ensnared by the private desires of form and *qi*,
they lose their natural *nature*,
yet their *nature* is never truly lost.
Only the *First Awakened* can skillfully guide them to awareness,
align with their affairs to encompass them,
and thus restore their original, natural state.

As *Zhuangzi* says:
*"If they stand at the brink of the abyss,
I shall also stand with them at the brink of the abyss."*
To reach the state of *flawlessness*—this is the way.

This is the *virtue* of the Sage’s great harmony,
the teaching of *no private agenda*,
by which one follows *nature*’s course,
bending and completing without omission.

Only those who end in *self-abandonment*
are not included in this.

The *lame* do not stand,
the *limping* do not walk.
*Limping*—pronounced *kuà*, same as *enterprising*.
The *limping* are those who straddle both extremes.

*Master Wen* said:
*"To defy the constancy of one’s *nature* while the heart clings to partiality—
thus, both cannot coexist."*

The *self-revealed* are not enlightened,
the *self-proclaimed* are never truly clear,
the *self-righteous* do not shine,
those who *mar their own worth* while claiming righteousness—
who would believe them?

The *self-praised* achieve no merit,
those who boast of their own labors—
others do not regard them as merit.
The *self-conceited* do not endure,
those who dazzle with their abilities—
they cannot last long.

As for the *Dao*,
it speaks of *"excessive nourishment and superfluous actions."*
Some may detest them,
*superfluous*—pronounced *zhuàng*, meaning flesh attached to the main body.
*Actions*—pronounced *xíng*, as in *"to walk."*
*Detest*—with falling tone.

Master Wen said:
*"These are all those who compete externally while losing themselves internally.
Like discarded surplus food—
it only makes others detest it;
like parasitic growth—
it only makes one appear grotesque.
Thus, those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon such things.
*Dwell*—upper tone, meaning not to fix one’s mind upon them, as if casting them off entirely."*

**Chapter Twenty-Four** (River Above: *Kù’ēn*)
This chapter speaks of those who master unity within, yet do not boast outwardly.

There exists something mixed and complete,
born before Heaven and Earth.
*Born*—*xījiàn* cut, meaning prior in existence.
The Dao is mixed and complete in its essence,
eternally existing since antiquity,
from which the Two Complements arise.
*Thing*—the Dao’s manifestation as things.
Silent and boundless,
it stands alone yet never alters,
circulates endlessly yet never falters—
thus it may be called the Mother of all things.
*Silent*—utterly soundless,
*boundless*—formless and distant.
In its essence, it stands unmatched and unchanging,
in its function, it circulates universally without peril—
this is the complete, original whole,
possessing the wondrous power of generation and transformation.
*Mother*—the source of all generation,
not reducible to any single thing,
thus praised as *silent and boundless*;
yet not lost in empty stillness,
so both essence and function are spoken of—
independent, circulating, and inexhaustibly generative.

I know not its name—
I call it *Dao*,
and forcefully name it *Great*.
*Forcefully*—upper tone, for it cannot truly be named.
*Great* is called *Passing*—
*Passing*—to go forth, meaning it pervades all things.
*Passing* is called *Distant*—
it reaches everywhere without limit.
*Distant* is called *Returning*—
when pushed to its utmost, its greatness knows no boundary;
when sought, its smallness knows no interior—
it permeates all things yet never departs from its source.
Thus, the Dao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
and the Sage is great.
Within the realm, there are four greats,
and the Sage occupies one of them.

The Dao transcends Heaven and Earth’s formed existence,
hence the chapter begins with *"before Heaven and Earth,"*
yet it is never absent from within Heaven and Earth’s formed realm,
hence it is also said: *"Within the realm, there are four greats."*
If spoken of in terms of the Dao,
then Heaven, Earth, and the Sage are insufficient to describe its greatness—
yet the Dao is not separate from these three as another thing.
Thus, when speaking of the realm,
people only recognize the greatness of these three,
hence it is said so.
It is not meant to say the Dao is also one thing within the realm—
scholars must not let the words obscure the meaning.
The phrase *"and the Sage occupies one of them"* means:
Man is the heart of Heaven and Earth,
uniting with the Dao,
to conceal Heaven within Heaven,
and Earth within Earth.
Among all things, the most refined and luminous is Man,
and the Sage governs them.
Man follows Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the Dao,
The Dao follows *zìrán*.
*Follow*—the meaning of mutual dependence.
Thus, in order:
Man dwells within Earth,
taking form and receiving position;
Earth corresponds to Heaven,
while Heaven still has form;
The Dao permeates the Three Powers,
its essence being *zìrán* alone.
If we trace their mutual dependence,
these three all originate from the natural Dao—
diverse in form, yet one in essence.
Thus, Heaven is within the Dao,
Earth is within Heaven,
Man is within Earth,
Mind is within Man,
Spirit is within Mind—
all converging in the Dao.

Thus, Spirit is hidden in Mind,
Mind in Form,
Form in Earth,
Earth in Heaven,
Heaven in the Dao.
Master Wen said:
*"If a man were to recover his nature in a day,
then these three—Heaven, Earth, and Man—
all would be fully realized by him."*

**Chapter Twenty-Five** (River Above: *Xiàngyuán*)
This chapter praises the Dao’s greatness and naturalness.

The heavy gives root to the light,
the still governs the restless.
Thus, the virtuous person walks all day
without departing from his burden.
*Heavy*—*zhíyòng* cut.
*Light*—*qǐzhèng* cut, of few schemes.
*Restless*—*zào*, early report cut.
*Depart*—falling tone.
*Burden*—*zī*,庄持 cut, a heavy cart.
The Sage’s Way takes stillness and weight as its foundation,
not to be recklessly abandoned,
like a cart’s burden—
its movement must not be taken lightly.

Though there are splendid sights,
his dwelling remains serene and detached.
*Sights*—*guān*, ancient *luàn* cut.
*Dwelling*—upper tone.
Splendor belongs to things,
tranquility belongs to oneself—
only by not exchanging oneself for things
does one wander and observe with ease,
unattached, self-sufficient beyond things.

How can one who rules the myriad chariots
make his body lighter than the world?
Lightness leads to losing one’s ministers,
restlessness leads to losing one’s sovereignty.
*Chariots*—falling tone.
*Body lighter*—as the characters.
The exalted ruler must not indulge private desires
while neglecting the world’s weight.
Lightness leads to reckless action,
thus losing the support of ministers.
Restlessness disturbs the people,
thus losing the Way of rulership.
Some say:
*"Lightness causes the ruler to lose the support of ministers,
restlessness causes ministers to fail in their duties to the ruler."*

**Chapter Twenty-Six** (River Above: *Zhòngdé*)
This chapter states that only through stillness and weight
can one govern all things.

Some say:
*"Taking it near to oneself,
the mind is the ruler,
qi is the minister—
lightness causes the mind to act recklessly and oppress qi,
restlessness causes qi to disturb and counter the mind.
The ruler is the master of people and things,
the mind is the master of the body—
what must be still and weighted is non-action, yet achieving success."*

Good conduct leaves no tracks,
*Conduct*—*xíng*, down *Mèng* cut.
Wheels rolling leave tracks in the earth—
what tracks does the Dao leave?
Good speech leaves no flaws,
*Flaws*—*xiá*, down *Jiā* cut, blemishes.
*Over*—*zhé*, straight *gé* cut, meaning speech is harmonious with Heaven’s intent,
thus no verbal errors.
Good planning does not require calculations—
the Dao is one, encompassing all things.

「善闭无关楗而不可开，
The adept at closure requires no bolts or bars yet remains unopenable—
*Bolts*—*guān*, *its* *yǎn* cut; *bars*—*jié*, *its* *yǎn* cut, the wooden frame that blocks a door. Horizontal is called *guān*, vertical is called *jié*.
Without doors or walls, four ways open vast and boundless,
Yet even the boundless Heaven and Earth cannot exceed its limits—
this is called adept closure.

善结无绳约而不可解。
The adept at binding needs no cords or fetters yet remains unseverable.

妙本湛然，不为法缚，不求法脱，
The wondrous root is profound and serene—
unbound by dharma, yet not clinging to dharma’s release,
spacious and dense, utterly without separation—
this is called never to be parted for a moment.

苟溺於刻意尚行，执言滞句，
If one is ensnared by rigid intentions and dogmatic practices,
clutching words and fixating on phrases,
using the mind to measure and calculate in pursuit of the Dao,

而不达方便之门，
yet fails to enter the gate of expedient means,
then one is bound by doctrinal forms and cannot penetrate to the fundamental source of all dharma.
Thus, one cannot truly perceive the roots of ten thousand things.

所谓善者，无为而已。
What is called "good" is simply non-action.

是以圣人常善救人，故无弃人；
Thus, the sage always adeptly rescues others—
therefore, there are none abandoned.
常善救物，故无弃物。
Always adeptly rescuing things—
therefore, there are none discarded.
This is called inheriting clarity.

夫救人於危难，特救其形耳，
To rescue others from peril is but to save their physical form—
而且未必能博，
and even this may not always succeed.
岂足为善哉。
How can this be called "good"?

惟彼方执着有为，迷其性於暗蔽之中，
Only those who cling to deliberate action,
lost in their nature within the obscured darkness,
我以兼容之量容之，以先觉之明觉之，
I encompass them with boundless tolerance,
and awaken them with foresighted clarity,
使彼之天光自发，
so that their inherent luminosity may naturally arise—
如明灯之传袭无尽，
like a bright lamp passed endlessly,
而在我者既以与人己愈多，
and as I give more to others, I also give more to myself,
则其明亦何限量哉。
thus, my clarity knows no bounds.

叶梦得曰：常之为言，无时而不然也。
Ye Mengde says: "Constant" means
never failing at any time.

故善人，不善人之师；
Thus, the good person is the teacher of the ungood;
不善人，善人之资。
and the ungood person is the resource of the good.
因其不善而教之使善，
To take their ungoodness and guide them toward goodness—
乃所以为善救也。
this is the true way of adept rescue.

则是资其不善者，以为吾施教之地矣。
Thus, those who rely on their ungoodness
are the very ground upon which I teach.

林东曰：因其不善而不为之，是可资也。
Lindong says: "To act upon their ungoodness yet not be swayed by it—
this is the true resource.
不贵其师，不爱其资，
I do not revere their teacher,
nor cherish their resource,
虽智大迷，是谓要妙。
even if their wisdom is great yet they remain lost—
this is called essential subtlety.

夫道之要妙，非教能到，
For the essential subtlety of the Dao,
no teaching can reach it.
故至於不贵不爱之地，
Thus, when one arrives at the realm of neither reverence nor attachment,
则知无我。
one knows the selflessness of all things.
人虽大智而莫测，
Though one may possess great wisdom yet remain unfathomable,
盖能所俱忘，
for both subject and object are forgotten—
是曰独化者也。

This is called the One Who Transforms Alone.

右二十七章　河上名巧用。
This concludes the twenty-seventh chapter,
known by Hedong as *Skillful Application*.

此章明名连双泯，教理兼忘。
This chapter elucidates the extinction of names and pairs,
and the simultaneous forgetting of teachings and principles.

知其雄，守其雌，为天下溪。
To know its *yang* (masculine),
and hold to its *yin* (feminine)—
this is the model for all under Heaven.
*Model*—*xī*, down *Sì* cut; *stream*—*xī*.
*Yang*—*xióng*, down *Yǔ* cut; *yin*—*cí*, down *Shì* cut.

知彼守此，则所守者非勉强而有常。
To know the other while holding to this—
then what is held is not forced yet remains constant.
夫雌静谦下，众必赴归，
For *yin* is tranquil, humble, and yielding—
all things will naturally converge.
犹水附地。
Like water clinging to the earth.
相守之审在乎有常，
The essence of mutual holding lies in constancy,
则雄动高强之念不作，
thus the thought of *yang*’s forceful action does not arise,
故性醇气和，无欲之至，
and so the nature is pure, the *qi* harmonious,
reaching the utmost of desirelessness,
而赤子之心不失，
and the heart of the uncarved infant remains unlost—
此专气以致柔也。
this is called concentrating *qi* to attain softness.

知其白，守其黑，为天下式。
To know its white,
and hold to its black—
this is the pattern for all under Heaven.
*Pattern*—*shì*, down *Zhì* cut.

为天下式，常德不忒，
As the pattern for all under Heaven,
constant virtue never falters—
复归於无极。
and returns to the boundless.
以恬养智，与道冥一，
To cultivate wisdom with serenity,
and merge with the Dao in obscurity,
则可为天下之所取式。
then one may be adopted as the pattern for all under Heaven.
以其德有常而不变不差，
For their virtue is constant,
neither changing nor erring,
故用未尝穷，量未尝极，
thus their application is never exhausted,
their capacity never bounded—
此恬与智交养而成和也。
this is called the harmony of serenity and wisdom.

知其荣，守其辱，为天下谷。
To know its glory,
and hold to its humiliation—
this is the valley for all under Heaven.
*Valley*—*gǔ*, down *Yù* cut.

为天下谷，常德乃足，
As the valley for all under Heaven,
constant virtue is sufficient—
复归於朴。
and returns to the uncarved.
为众所归而取式，
To be the refuge of all yet remain as a pattern,
则荣矣。
is to be glorified.
故处之以辱而受众垢，
Thus, to place oneself in humiliation
and endure the defilement of all,
有如谷之能容能应而未尝匮乏，
like a valley that can contain and respond
yet never lacks—
则复於浑然之全体矣，
then one returns to the complete unity of the undivided—
此和行而成德也。
this is called the virtue of harmonious action.

自婴儿与无极，言入德之序，
From the uncarved infant to the boundless,
these words describe the stages of entering virtue,
而复於朴，
and returning to the uncarved—
乃其所至之地也。
this is the ultimate destination.

朴散则为器，
The uncarved disperses to become vessels;
圣人用之则为官长，
the sage employs it to become an official or leader—
故大制不割。
thus, great governance does not cut or sever.
*Leader*—*guānzhǎng*, down *Guàn* cut.

朴即道也，
The uncarved is the Dao itself—
形而上者谓之道，
the formless and transcendent is called the Dao;
归於朴则体斯立焉。
returning to the uncarved, its substance stands firm.
形而下者谓之器，
The formed and immanent is called vessels.
故散朴为器以应万物，
Thus, the dispersion of the uncarved into vessels
responds to all things—
道之用所以行也。
this is how the Dao’s application unfolds.
圣人用此道以为民物之主，
The sage employs this Dao to rule over people and things,
亦因其理势之自然，
following its inherent principles and tendencies,
虽制而非有所裁割。
though governing, yet without arbitrary division or severance.

曹曰：大制犹天地之造物，
Cao says: Great governance is like Heaven and Earth’s creation—
物随性而自成，
things follow their nature and form spontaneously,
不烦裁制也。
without need for artificial regulation.

右二十八章　河上名反朴。
This concludes the twenty-eighth chapter,
known by Hedong as *Returning to the Uncarved*.

此章明牧谦以容物，
This chapter elucidates the sage’s humble shepherding to contain all things,
泯迹而返朴，
extinguishing traces and returning to the uncarved,
故其用不穷。
thus its application is inexhaustible.

或云雄者天一之水，
Some say: *Yang* is the water of Heaven’s first principle—
在人为精。
in humans, it is essence.
雌者地二之火，
*Yin* is the fire of Earth’s second principle—
在人为神。
in humans, it is spirit.
白者，金也。
White is metal.
黑者，水也。
Black is water.
此又一家之论也。
This is another school’s interpretation.

将欲取天下而为之者，
Those who would seize all under Heaven and act upon it—
吾见其不得已。
I see their necessity as futile.
天下神器，
All under Heaven is a divine vessel—
不可为也。
not to be acted upon.
为者败之，
To act upon it is to ruin it;
执者失之。
to grasp it is to lose it.
天下乃天地神明之器也，
All under Heaven is the divine vessel of Heaven and Earth’s luminous clarity—
惟顺其自然而自治。
only by following its natural course can it be governed.
将欲取而为之，
Those who would seize and act upon it—
是以人灭天，
thus extinguish Heaven with human contrivance,
以故灭命。
and extinguish life with fate.
身犹天下也，
The body is like all under Heaven—
故黄帝南望而玄珠遗，
thus, the Yellow Emperor, gazing south, lost his black pearl.
机心方存而纯白不备。
For while deliberate scheming still lingered,
the pristine whiteness was not yet complete.
故物或行或随，
Thus, things either move or follow,
或嘘或吹，
or warm or cool,
或强或羸，
or flourish or weaken,
或载或隳。
or complete or decay.
*Warm*—*xū*, down *Yù* cut; *cool*—*chuī*, down *Zhì* cut.
*Flourish*—*qiáng*, down *Jiàng* cut; *weaken*—*léi*, down *Lì* cut.
*Complete*—*zài*, down *Zhǎi* cut; *decay*—*huī*, down *Hùi* cut.

有为之物，必属对待，
Things of deliberate action inevitably belong to opposites,
消息盈虚，
rising and falling, full and empty,
相推不已。
endlessly propelling one another.
惟抱一者，
Only those who embrace the One—
不入其机。
do not enter their contrivances.
是以圣人去甚，去奢，去泰。
Thus, the sage eliminates excess, extravagance, and superfluity.

「去」—*Qù*, rising tone, **to eliminate**.

The sage knows that external things cannot be relied upon,
yet understands that circumstances inevitably influence one another,
which is the natural order of things.
Thus, he follows their spontaneity
and does not wish to make them overflow and exceed.

Hence, the *Tài* hexagram states:
*"The ruler, with wealth, fulfills the Dao of Heaven and Earth,
supports the harmonious principles of Heaven and Earth,
and governs the people."*

**Chapter 29**—*Hé Shàng* names it **"Non-Action"** (*Wúwéi*).
This chapter says that only through **Non-Action** (*Wúwéi*) and natural spontaneity
can there be enduring constancy.

Those who assist the ruler with the Dao
do not use force to subdue the world;
their actions are **fruitful yet return to moderation**.

Where armies dwell, thorny brambles grow.
After great campaigns, there will surely be years of calamity.

*Strong*—*qiáng*, down *Qǔliáng* cut.
*Good*—*hǎo*, down *Qù* cut.
*Return*—*huán*, rhymes with *xuán* ("rotate").
*Dwell*—*chǔ*, rising tone.

The *Yù Zhù* commentary says:
*"What Mencius called 'turning against them'—
the army seizes the people’s strength.
Thus, thorny brambles grow,
as it disrupts the harmonious *qi* above,
and so there are years of calamity."*

Thus, the virtuous act **fruitfully** (*guǒ*)
and nothing more;
they dare not take force upon themselves.

*Fruit*—*guǒ*, rhymes with *yǐ* ("already"), same below.

War is indeed something that those who follow the Dao do not take,
yet Heaven creates the **Five Villages** (*Wǔcūn*), which cannot be abandoned.
**Compare water and fire**—
it lies in their **proper use**.

Only in stopping violence and relieving hardship
does fruitfulness rank just below righteousness.
For all that is **right and proper** within us,
what we uphold will never bend.

The *Chūnqiū* commentary says:
*"Slaying the enemy is fruitfulness."*
It means that slaying the enemy
is merely to prevent mutual encroachment—
how dare one take force upon the world!

**Fruitful yet unboastful**,
**fruitful yet unvaunting**,
**fruitful yet unproud**,
**fruitful only when unavoidable**,
**fruitful yet not forced**—
for fruitfulness triumphs through **rightness**,
while force triumphs through **strength**.

Only the **fruitful** have the latent yet certain power to conquer,
not because they rely on strength and delight in war.
Thus, they stand in fear before action,
delight in strategy yet achieve success,
and respond only when unavoidable—
never forcing it.

When things reach their **peak of vigor** (*zhàng*), they grow old—
this is called **not following the Dao**,
and **not following the Dao** leads to early decline.

When things reach their **peak of vigor** (*zhàng*), they grow old;
when armies reach their **peak of force** (*qiáng*), they meet defeat.
Thus, armies that rely on **force** (*qiáng*)
cannot fully preserve their **virtuous conquests** (*shànshèng*).
The use of **peak vigor** (*zhàng*)
only hastens their decay and aging—
all are **not in accord with the Dao** and **lack knowing when to stop**.

**Chapter 30**—*Hé Shàng* names it **"Frugal Martiality"** (*Jiǎnwǔ*).
This chapter says that assisting with the Dao
brings the people’s hearts to love and revere,
while wielding arms and seeking **force**
is insufficient to win their loyalty.

The **best weapons** are **ominous instruments** (*liáoqì*),
and things often **abhor** (*wù*) them—
thus, those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.

*Abhor*—*wù*, down *Qù* cut.
*Dwell*—*chǔ*, rising tone, same below.

The finest weapons are those wielded by the virtuous.

Yet arms are ultimately instruments of calamity. Even sentient beings abhor and avoid them—how much more so those who follow the Dao? Only when used to resolve crises, never as a constant, do they not dwell upon such things in their hearts.

Thus, the virtuous in repose honor the left, while wielding arms they honor the right.
The left is yang, the principle of life.
The right is yin, the principle of killing.
Weapons are ominous instruments, not the tools of the virtuous. Used only when unavoidable, tranquility and composure are paramount.

Victory without pride—
*Composure* (*tian*), pronounced *Du Lǎn*, meaning *tranquility*.
To cherish life and abhor killing, yet hold no desire for conquest—
thus, those who delight in killing cannot prevail in the world.
*Delight*, pronounced *Qù*.
Only those who do not crave killing can fulfill the world’s aspirations.

Auspicious matters favor the left; inauspicious matters favor the right.
Hence, the *Pianjiang* (vanguard general) stands left, the *Shangjiang* (commander-in-chief) stands right—
speaking of treating war as funeral rites.
When many are slain, mourn with sorrowful tears;
when victorious, observe funeral rites.
*Treat*, rising tone. *Funeral*, level tone.

*Bìxū Zǐ* says: The right is yin, the domain of death—
thus funeral rites favor the right, an inauspicious act.
The *Shangjiang* holds sole authority over slaughter—
thus he stands right, while the *Pianjiang* does not wield such power.

*Huáng* says: Weapons cannot be abandoned because bandits and hostile states harm humanity.
The body is like a state—greed and desire harm others in the same way.
Only those who follow the Dao, empty and tranquil, without cravings or attachments,
need fear no harm from external things—
whether voices, colors, or other temptations.

---
**Chapter 31**—*Hé Shàng* names it **"Laying Down Arms"** (*Yǎnwǔ*).
This chapter states that weapons are ominous instruments,
not to be relied upon as a constant.

*Wang Bì* suggests this chapter may not be by Laozi himself,
yet these words arise from the times.
The Dao is ever nameless; though simple, it cannot be subdued.
If lords and kings could guard it, all things would submit of their own accord.
Heaven and Earth unite, descending sweet dew—
no command is given, yet all is balanced.
*Command*, pronounced *Lìzhèng*, akin to *teaching and decree*.
*Simple* (*pǔ*)—this refers to the Dao’s complete essence.
Because it is formless, it is called *small*.
Because it precedes all things, none can subdue it.

*Wēn Gōng* says: When lords and kings uphold the Dao,
the people submit, the *qi* harmonizes, and all are transformed—
just as the receptive *qi* unites and sweet dew descends naturally,
spreading evenly and permeating all things.
This is called the *Three Powers* (*tiān, dì, rén*) converging in the Dao.

Once names are established, names are already set.
Yet one must know when to stop—
knowing when to stop prevents disaster.

*Wén Dìng* says: The undifferentiated is dispersed into instruments,
thus rites are established based on their functions.
Yet how could one abandon the undifferentiated for names,
or pursue the superficial while losing the fundamental?
Rather, one must know when to stop and return to one’s nature—
thus, amid endless transformations, one remains unshaken.
The Dao in the world is like streams and valleys to the sea.
*Cáo* says: The sea is the source of water;
streams and valleys are its branches.
All branches ultimately converge at the source,
all names return to the Dao.

---
**Chapter 32**—*Hé Shàng* names it **"Victory Through Virtue"** (*Shèngdé*).
This chapter speaks of how guarding the Dao ensures constancy.

To know others is wisdom;
to know oneself is enlightenment.
*Discernment* (*bié*) is wisdom—knowing others.
*Exhaustive clarity* (*bì*) is enlightenment—seeing one’s true nature.
Once enlightened, one does not merely know oneself
but can also comprehend others.

Those who overcome others rely on strength;
those who overcome themselves are truly strong.
The vigor of blood and *qi* cannot be possessed—
thus, conquering others through force is not to be prized.
The courage of principle and righteousness cannot be absent—
thus, subduing oneself and returning to one’s nature
means no one can bend you, and none are stronger.

The contented are rich—
only through self-knowledge does one always suffice,
abundantly at ease.
The resolute have will—
only through self-mastery does one persist in the Dao without ceasing,
and none can steal one’s resolve—
thus, one aligns with Heaven’s vitality.

Those who do not lose their place endure.
*Place*, akin to the *Gèn* hexagram’s "stopping in one’s place."
Only those who know the Dao and act upon it
find their proper place and dwell in security.
Thus, though things transform endlessly, the heart never strays—
never a day without self-realization—
this is how one endures.

To die without forgetting is longevity.
Only those who know themselves, strengthen themselves,
and never lose their place truly attain longevity.
This is not bound by life and death’s fluctuations,
standing alone and unchanging—
how could such a state be measured by years?

Initially, this does not speak of *spirit, soul, or vital essence*
remaining untransformed, lingering in the murky void—
here, one must see through to clarity.

*Shào Ruòyú* says: Though the form perishes, the nature does not die.

---
**Chapter 33**—*Hé Shàng* names it **"Discriminating Virtue"** (*Biàndé*).
This chapter begins with self-knowledge,
thus wisdom is attained.
Then, with resolute will and acceptance of one’s fate,
one exerts utmost effort to reach the proper stopping point—
thus, one governs the body without peril.
This is why the *Rǔyǎo* must awaken to solitary clarity
before entering the realm beyond life and death.

The Great Dao is vast—
it cannot be confined to left or right.
*Vast* (*fàn*), also read as *fàn*—unobstructed.
Only by not clinging to any single thing,
remaining in its proper place,
present everywhere and never otherwise,
does one encounter the source on all sides.

All things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse—
its work done, it does not dwell on achievement.
Clothing all things yet claiming no mastery,
thus, it is ever without desire—
this may be called *small*.
All things return to it, yet it knows no lord—
this may be called *great*.

The *clothing* (clothing, *yī*)—with a falling tone—
covers all things yet does not reveal its sovereign dominion,
thus it remains ever still and without trace,
the utmost of *small*.

All things move and interact yet none can perceive its measure,
so it expands boundlessly yet lacks form to be grasped,
the utmost of *great*.

This is why the Dao is *vast*—
it may be encountered on all sides.

Hence, the Sage never claims greatness,
and thus is able to fulfill it.
If one claims greatness, it becomes *small*—
only the Supreme Sage merges with the Dao,
and thus attains greatness.

---
**Chapter Thirty-Four**
*River-Upper* names it *Achievement* (*Rén Dé*).

This chapter states that those who perfect the radiant virtue
all derive it from following the Dao.

To hold the *Great Image* (*Dà Xiàng*), all under Heaven will come.
Coming yet causing no harm,
they are secure, tranquil, and at ease.

The *Image without image* (*wú xiàng zhī xiàng*)—
thus it is called the *Great Image*.
To *hold* (*zhí*) is to embody it without contradiction.

The Dao is the mother of all things;
things come and attach to virtue,
like children returning to their mother.

To *come* (*wǎng*) is to *return* (*guī*).
Yet when the multitude returns,
if one harbors a sense of self,
harm will ensue.

Only the Supreme Sage empties himself to preserve sincerity,
benefiting yet causing no harm,
so neither he nor others are injured,
and his heart remains tranquil, peaceful, and at ease.

Zhuangzi said:
*The Sage interacts with things without harming them,
and if he does not harm them,
things cannot harm him either.*
Only he who harms nothing
can truly meet others with mutual accord—
this is the same meaning.

*Music and bait* (pleasures and inducements),
*passing guests* (fleeting influences) may halt.
The Dao’s utterance is bland—
without flavor to taste,
unseen when viewed,
inaudible when heard,
its use never exhausted.

*Music* (pleasures) and *bait* (inducements) are *Yue* (ear-pleasing).
*Out* (utterance, *chū*)—with a falling tone.
*Bland* (*dàn*)—read as *tú zàn*.
It refers to those who do not grasp the *Great Image*
and are confined to a narrow, one-sided Dao,
like the loss of hearing to melodious tones,
or the fleeting delight of cattle and horses in food.

Though *passing guests* (fleeting influences) may linger for a moment,
their power is ultimately finite—
then they will depart, leaving behind.

Zhuangzi metaphorically speaks of stopping at the *Qiaolu* (a humble dwelling)
for one night—
this is the same intent.

Yet the *Great Dao*,
though profound and without form, sound, or scent,
its efficacy is boundless.

*Exhausted* (*jì*)—to *finish* (*jìn*).
---
**Chapter Thirty-Five**
*River-Upper* names it *Virtue and Benevolence* (*Rén Dé*).

This chapter illustrates the boundless effects of embodying the Dao.

To *gather* (*xī*), one must first *expand* (*zhāng*);
To *weaken* (*ruò*), one must first *strengthen* (*qiáng*);
To *abandon* (*fèi*), one must first *flourish* (*xīng*);
To *take away* (*duó*), one must first *bestow* (*yǔ*).

This is called *Subtle Clarity* (*Wēi Míng*).

When *expansion* reaches its limit, it must *gather*;
When *bestowal* is excessive, it must *take away*—
this is the inevitable principle.

What is called *"must first"* (*bì gù*)
is like saying:
When things are about to *gather*,
they were originally *expanded*—
then *gathering* follows naturally.
This is the principle of *ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness* (*xiāo xì yíng xū*).

Though its mechanism is subtle and hidden,
the principle is clear and evident—
only those who dwell in *clarity and stillness, gentleness and weakness*
do not fall into its trap.

*Gentleness* overcomes *rigidity*,
*weakness* overcomes *strength*.
Only by residing in *gentleness and weakness*
does one lack the intent to overcome,
and the principle naturally aligns—
this is the teaching of *Returning to the Root* (*Shǒu Fù*).

If one is *rigid and strong*,
it means they have already overreached—
*decay* will inevitably follow.

*A fish cannot be plucked from the depths*—
The state’s *sharp tools* (tools of power),
cannot be displayed to the people.

For the one who embraces the Dao within himself
and withdraws to conceal it in secrecy.

*Sharp tools* are those that control entry and exit,
which all people rely on,
yet the ruler who holds their mechanism
uses them to govern others.

Not only should they not be displayed to the people,
but they cannot even be *obtained* to display to others.
This is what the *Yinfu* (a Daoist text) refers to as *stealing the mechanism*.

The people can be made to follow,
but cannot be made to know.

Wen Ding said:
*The fish, as a creature, has no claws or teeth
to overpower others.*
Yet when it rests in the depths,
even the strongest cannot seize it—
but once it leaves the depths,
then people can capture and control it.

The Sage alone dwells in *gentleness and weakness* without satiety,
thus he can ultimately subdue all under Heaven—
this is not something shared with the common people.

---
**Chapter Thirty-Six**
*River-Upper* names it *Subtle Clarity* (*Wēi Míng*).

This chapter demonstrates that the principle of *ebbing and flowing, fullness and emptiness*
is constant,
while those who cling to *gentleness and weakness*
do not understand its mechanism.

The Dao acts without action,
yet nothing remains undone.
Silent and unmoving,
all principles are complete,
responding when touched,
leaving no matter unattended.

If sovereigns and kings could preserve this,
all things would naturally transform.

When transformation is complete and they wish to act,
I would restrain them with the *Unnamed Root* (*wú míng zhī pǔ*).

To always embody the *Supreme Dao*,
then one need not teach—
transformation will occur naturally.

Yet time will bring change,
like the infant’s hair turning into knowledge—
then one must again restrain with *non-desire*.

*Non-desire* leads to *stillness*,
which is the complete embodiment of the Dao—
truly the *Unnamed Root*.

The *Unnamed Root* will also not desire,
*non-desire* brings *stillness*,
and all under Heaven will naturally align.

If one harbors a *desiring Root* (*yù pǔ*) in his heart,
he will lose its complete embodiment.

This is to exhaust one’s nature to reach one’s destiny,
to be great and capable of transformation.

Such *true stillness* (*zhēn jìng*)
is why all things under Heaven
are naturally transformed,
each preserving its innate nature and destiny.

---
**Chapter Thirty-Seven**
*River-Upper* names it *Governance* (*Wéi Zhèng*).

This chapter reveals how embodying the Dao can transform,
and how it also encompasses
forgetting in *mystic enlightenment* (*Xuǎn Wù*).

From the beginning to this point,
a total of thirty-seven chapters—
completing the *Upper Part* (*Shàng Piān*).

*Daoist Classic of the Way and Virtue with Annotated Commentaries*
*Volume Two* ends.

---
**Volume Three**
*Commentaries by Later Scholars*
*Bo Dong Si Jing* (董思靖)

The virtue of the **Highest Dao** does not cling to virtue,
and thus it possesses virtue.

*The Commentary* says: Confucius did not dwell upon his sageliness,
and thus he truly possessed virtue.

To embody the Dao and gain its benefits for oneself—this is virtue.

Wang Gu and others say:
He who has virtue transcends his flaws,
while he who lacks virtue clings to his gains.

The virtue of the **Lower Dao** does not lose virtue,
and thus it lacks virtue.

To cling rigidly to it, trembling in fear of losing it—
this is one who cannot yet transform,
and thus falls short of the **Highest Dao**.

The **Highest Dao** acts without action,
and yet nothing is left undone.
*"With"* here means *"to employ"*—
it means employing nothing in action.
The same applies below.

The **Highest Dao** is supreme virtue,
and its essence lies in non-action alone.

The **Lower Dao** acts and yet employs means.

This requires thought before attainment,
and effort before fulfillment—
the deeds of those who act yet have not reached perfection.

Since they are still entangled in action,
they cannot fully embody the Supreme Dao.
This explains the distinction between **Highest** and **Lower Dao**.

**Highest Benevolence** acts yet employs nothing.
Benevolence is the virtue of the heart,
the principle of love—
when spoken of specifically, it encompasses the four virtues.

This does not refer to the universal transformation of the Dao,
and thus it falls short of the **Highest Dao** in rank.
Yet transformation is stillness—
though it acts, it employs nothing in action.

**Highest Righteousness** acts and yet employs means.
Righteousness is what is fitting in conduct,
but carries the implication of division and constraint,
and thus ranks lower.

**Highest Ritual** acts, yet none respond,
so it forces compliance by bared arms.
Ritual is the ordered patterns of Heaven’s principles,
the propriety of human affairs—
its foundation lies in loyalty and sincerity,
but excessive formality becomes mere ornament.

If today it is enforced, then its essence is stripped away,
and it is imposed by force.
When some refuse to comply, it resorts to bared arms,
and its excesses become unbearable.

Laozi lived in an age of extreme formalism,
and thus speaks of it with particular urgency—
he wished to transform the people through the natural Way of non-action.

These three are spoken of as **"Highest"**
because those below are unworthy of mention.

*"Bared arms"* means rolling up one’s sleeves to bare the arms.
*"Rem"* means *"to follow"*—
Wen Gong says: *"Rem"* means *"to draw"*—
the character may also be written as *"rēng."*

When the Dao is lost, only then does virtue arise;
when virtue is lost, only then does humanity appear;
when humanity is lost, only then does righteousness emerge;
when righteousness is lost, only then does ritual take form.

The Dao is an undifferentiated whole,
shared by Heaven, Earth, and all things.

Human nature embodies principle,
and when this principle is realized within oneself—
without reliance on the external—
it is called *virtue*.

Initially, there is no virtue separate from the Dao,
but once named as *virtue*,
it is divided into ranks and distinctions,
unlike the Dao’s all-encompassing embrace.
Thus, when virtue is not fully realized,
the complete body is still the Dao.

If one clings to virtue as possession,
then lower virtue fails to transform,
and the Dao’s wholeness is lost—
hence, *"When the Dao is lost, only then does virtue arise."*

The *Guan Yin Zi* says:
*"What can be named is called virtue, not Dao."*

When the name of virtue is prominent,
the name of the Dao fades.
When the name of humanity is prominent,
the name of virtue fades.
The more one pursues, the lower one descends,
and the more one values, the more one strays.

As *Zhuangzi* says:
*"The Dao is hidden in small achievements."*
Truly so.

Ritual is the thinning of loyalty and sincerity,
and the beginning of chaos.
When ritual’s excesses reach their peak,
its essence is diluted,
and its later stages become the source of disorder.
This is why Confucius sought guidance from those ahead of him.

Preconceived knowledge is the ornament of the Dao,
and the origin of folly.
This is the work of those who wield intelligence—
to force understanding through cleverness,
or to guess and occasionally succeed,
yet never truly comprehend.
This only obscures one’s natural clarity,
making it the beginning of folly.

As *Mencius* says:
*"What I dislike in intelligence is its rigidity."*

When obscured by superficial adornment,
one cannot preserve the purity of the Great Dao—
what else could it be but folly?

Thus, the true gentleman
has lofty vision beyond the world,
yet does not conform to its trends.
He dwells in substance, not in superficiality,
in reality, not in ornament—
and so he discards the latter for the former.

*"Dwelling"* and *"discarding"* are both read with the rising tone.
Why not return to the original?

Wen Ding says:
*"People’s sight stops at the eyes,
their hearing at the ears,
their thoughts at the mind—
thus they delight in what they grasp below
and lose sight of what is above.
They favor the shallow and neglect the profound,
pursue ornament and abandon substance.
Without the true gentleman’s resolve,
who could discard the one for the other?"*

---
**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Riverbank Discourse on Virtue**
This chapter clarifies complete virtue and encourages a return to simplicity.

Someone asked:
*"Do the Five Constants of morality and virtue have distinctions?
Or are they undifferentiated?
How do their applications differ?"*

The reply:
*"How could they be undifferentiated?
The Dao encompasses the whole,
while virtue arises from the measure of one’s capacity within oneself.
The Dao is like the undifferentiated primordial *qi*,
virtue is like the names given to seasons and times,
and humanity, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom
are like the designations of spring, summer, autumn, and winter.
When all four are fully realized,
it is called a year.
When humanity is at its peak,
it is spring;
when ritual is at its peak,
it is summer;
when righteousness is at its peak,
it is autumn;
when wisdom is at its peak,
it is winter—
each attaining its true essence.
Thus, every eighteen days of the season’s soil phase
corresponds to this principle.

There is humanity within righteousness,
so life contains death;
there is righteousness within humanity,
so death contains life—
as when willows wither in February
yet wheat sprouts in August.

The same applies to the world.

The *Huang Ji Jing Shi Shu* says:
The Three Sovereigns governed the world through the Dao,
the Five Emperors through virtue,
the Three Kings through merit,
and the Five Hegemons through force.
The Three Sovereigns shared humanity but differed in transformation,
the Five Emperors shared ritual but differed in teaching,
the Three Kings shared righteousness but differed in exhortation,
the Five Hegemons shared wisdom but differed in leadership.

Thus, the age of the Three Sovereigns was like spring,
the age of the Five Emperors like summer,
the age of the Three Kings like autumn,
and the age of the Five Hegemons like winter.

When Laozi met Guan Yin,
it was at the juncture of autumn and winter—
perhaps he sought to transform the world
with the steadfast Dao
and restore it to spring.

Someone asked:
*"Why do their sequences differ?"*

The reply:
*"Governance involves both adaptation and revolution.
Thus, the order follows what is natural,
but this chapter addresses the excesses of named distinctions,
so it advocates complete revolution.

As the *Book of Transformation* says:
When humanity is insufficient, righteousness supplements it—
metal subdues wood;
when righteousness is insufficient, ritual supplements it—
fire subdues metal;
when ritual is insufficient, wisdom supplements it—
water subdues fire;
when wisdom is insufficient, trust supplements it—
earth subdues water.

Thus, dwelling in substance and profundity
is the true essence of trust—
the beginning that is the end,
and the end that is the beginning.

Guo De Yuan once asked Zhu Wen Gong:
*"Laozi says ritual is the thinning of loyalty and sincerity,
and the origin of chaos.
Yet Confucius also sought guidance on ritual from others.
Why is this?"*

Wen Gong replied:
*"Laozi understood the complexities of ritual,
for he had once served as the Palace Archivist,
and thus grasped its intricacies—
that is why he spoke so well with Confucius.
But he also said ritual could be dispensed with,
as if the Sage’s use of it seemed burdensome,
which is why he spoke thus.
As in the *Ritual of Music*, where it says
*'Planning leads to action, and war arises from this,'*
there lies this very meaning.

In ancient times, those who attained Oneness—
Heaven attained Oneness and became clear,
Earth attained Oneness and became tranquil,
the Spirit attained Oneness and became responsive,
the grains attained Oneness and became abundant,
all things attained Oneness and flourished,
and the feudal lords attained Oneness to govern the world with integrity—
this is the effect of Oneness.

The One is the Dao,
which has always existed—
hence, it is called *ancient*.

All things possess it yet the Dao remains unchanged—
thus, it is called One.
Heaven’s clarity, Earth’s tranquility,
the Spirit’s responsiveness,
the grains’ abundance,
all things’ flourishing,
and the lords’ integrity—
each fulfills its natural function
through the power of the One."*

The Master Wen said: When speaking of affairs, if they endure without ceasing, this is what is meant by *One*.

Heaven, without its clarity, would risk fracturing;
Earth, without its tranquility, would risk erupting;
The Spirit, without its responsiveness, would risk fading;
The grains, without their abundance, would risk depletion;
All things, without their flourishing, would risk extinction;
The feudal lords, without their integrity, would risk collapse.
*Collapse*—pronounced *jué*, meaning to topple and fall.

It is through the *One* that Heaven remains clear and fulfills its role in nurturing life,
and through the *One* that Earth remains tranquil and fulfills its role in bearing and sustaining.
Should there be no clarity or tranquility,
then there would be the possibility of cracks, fractures, tremors, or upheavals—
this arises from losing the *One*.
Yet the *One* has never truly been lost;
hence, it is said *"would risk"*—this is merely an expression of doubt.

Moreover, the *One* as a thing
has neither departure nor arrival—
how could it be lost?
It is only that the ebb and flow of *qi* may sometimes be excessive or deficient,
unable to fully embody what the *One* accomplishes.

Thus, the *Book of Yin-Yang* states:
*"Heaven’s fracturing"* is due to insufficient *yang qi* and the decline of the ruler’s virtue.
*"Earth’s trembling"* is due to excess *yin qi* and the failure of the ministers’ duties.
For example, during the *Yuan Kang* era of the Jin Dynasty’s Emperor Hui,
Heaven split open for several *zhang*, with a resounding crash.
In the second year of King You of Zhou,
the Three Rivers trembled, and Mount Qi collapsed—
these are cases of the same kind.

As for the Spirit, it is called *Spirit* because of its responsiveness,
and its responsiveness comes from attaining the *One*.
If it lacks responsiveness, then its vitality is already extinguished.
*Fading*—meaning to cease.

The grains, without abundance, cannot receive and respond—
they too would reach their limits,
hence, it is said they would *deplete*.
All things rely on the *One* to flourish;
lose it, and they perish.
The feudal lords, without integrity, lose the Dao and cannot secure their own stability—
their states cannot be preserved.

Although the *One* is not absent,
it is merely that external malevolent *qi* or intrusive influences may sometimes obstruct its proper manifestation.

First mentioning Heaven—
the greatest of forms.
Finally mentioning the ruler—
the sovereign over Heaven, Earth, and all things.
Only the ruler can preserve the *One*
to set the standard for the world,
and thus Heaven and Earth take their proper places while all things flourish.

The Sage of Azure Emptiness said:
*"Gather and return to admonish the rulers and nobles."*
This is correct.

Thus, nobility finds its foundation in humility,
and height finds its base in lowliness.
Hence, the feudal lords refer to themselves as *"lonely, bereaved, and lacking"*—
is this not their way of grounding themselves in humility?
Is it not so?
*Lacking*—meaning *"beautiful"* in this context.

The perverse sounds—ah, yes.

Wén Dìng said:
*"What, then, is this* One *truly?*
To gaze upon it, no form is seen;
to grasp it, nothing is held—
the most subtle of all beneath Heaven.
This is what is called *lowly* and *base*.

When feudal lords call themselves *lonely, bereaved, and lacking*,
they speak of attaining the *One* as their foundation.
Thus, they seek neither hasty praise nor disdainful censure,
nor do they desire the gleaming brilliance of jade,
nor the rough hardness of stone.
*Lü*—the sound of *lù*, its likeness to jade.
*Luo*—the character should read *gě*, the sound of *luò*, its likeness to stone.
*Shù*—entered tone, swiftness.
Those who cannot shepherd humility,
who take *lowliness* as their foundation,
yet crave swift fame and exalted status—
this is *hasty praise*.
So then, exaggerated flattery gathers violently,
while baseless slander follows in its wake—
this is *disdainful censure*.
Yet still, they do not wish to be like jade,
noble yet unable to be base,
nor like stone,
base yet unable to be noble.
For only he who does not lean upon any single thing
cannot be defamed or praised, exalted or debased—
who else but he who has attained the *One* could achieve this?"

**Chapter Thirty-Nine**
*Riverbank [School] Canon of Names: The Origin*

This chapter extols the *One*’s function as supremely great,
yet ultimately warns against clinging to it.

The *Way* moves through inversion,
and finds its use in weakness.
To invert stillness is how the *Way* moves,
while its body, though weak, manifests true power.
It speaks of motion without mentioning stillness,
of weakness without mentioning strength—
a mutual parallelism revealing intent,
and clarifying the meaning of *body* and *use*.

It is said that if one establishes stillness to ground the *body*,
then the *use* of motion may unfold.
To speak of the *body*’s tranquil emptiness—this is weakness,
yet its reach is vast and ungoverned—this is strength.
Though *body* and *use*, motion and stillness flow without interruption,
motion must still root in stillness,
and *use* must still spring from *body*—
thus the primal transformation’s craft lies hidden in winter,
only to flourish in spring.
The *Way* of learning:
to refine essence and penetrate spirit—
this is the foundation for governance and application.

All things beneath Heaven arise from *having*,
yet *having* arises from *non-being*.
This is further proof of the principle of generation.

It is said that all things emerge through *qi*-transformation,
thus they arise from *having*.
Yet tracing their origin to their source—
the *Way* itself.
The *Way* initially has no form, sound, scent, or tangible presence—
thus it is said to arise from *non-being*.

**Chapter Forty**
*Riverbank [School] Canon of Names: The Elimination of Use*

This chapter clarifies how to exalt the *body* to achieve *use*.

Some say the *Way* takes stillness as its essence,
so motion becomes contrary to the *Way*.
If so, then the *Way* is confined solely to stillness—
a grave misunderstanding.
Truly, motion and stillness are the workings of *qi*,
while the *Way* governs and transcends motion and stillness,
unbound by them.

Some say inversion aligns with propriety—
this is the *Way*’s motion and responsiveness to change,
a display of *adaptive expedience*;
while weakness as self-preservation—
this is the *Way*’s constant application,
a display of *substantial reality*.
Yet when *having* arises from *non-being*,
expedience and reality merge indistinguishably.

The superior man hears the *Way* and diligently practices it;
the man of middle rank hears the *Way* and holds it as if present, as if absent;
the inferior man hears the *Way* and laughs in derision—
to not laugh would be to fail in recognizing the *Way*.
The *Way* is not form or sound,
not visible or audible—
only the superior man, endowed with pure stillness,
whose insight transcends, accepts it without doubt,
as empty when confronted with emptiness,
and never strays in haste.

The middle man’s perception wavers between high and low,
thus he oscillates between belief and doubt.
The inferior man lacks wisdom to comprehend,
and faith to uphold—
as Zhuangzi said, *"Lofty speech does not settle in the common heart,"*
so he laughs in derision.

Thus, the *Establishment of Speech* says:
*"The ancients who formulated doctrine declared:*
The *Way*, though clear, seems obscured—
only by illuminating the subtle essence,
abandoning form and discarding intellect,
does one contain light without radiance.

The *Way*, though level, seems uneven—
*level*—plainness;
*lu*—Lu’s cutting, like uneven silk.
High and low merge harmoniously,
boundless with all things,
yet to the vulgar eye,
it appears as if marked with defects,
unfit for use.

Advancing the *Way* seems like retreat—
to practice the *Way* is daily diminishment,
diminishing again and again,
until reaching *non-action*—
thus it seems like retreat.

Great *virtue* seems like a valley—
great *virtue* does not cling to *virtue*,
like a valley’s emptiness.

Great brightness seems like shame—
those who forget form and color
can embrace filth.

Broad *virtue* seems insufficient—
if *virtue* is broad yet constrained by measure,
then it is not truly broad.
Only when *virtue* is boundlessly broad,
yet does not consider itself sufficient,
can it truly be broad.

Establishing *virtue* seems like laziness—
to cultivate in secret, act in obscurity,
to build *virtue* without self-aggrandizement.
*The Treatise on Mysterious Threads* says:
*'Hidden merit preserves its wholeness.'*
This is the same meaning.

True substance seems corrupt—

---

True substance, though pure and unadorned, seems corrupt*—
*"Semü"* (渝), pronounced *Yangzhu*, means "to change."
True substance (质真) is pristine simplicity.
Only when both form and substance are complete
does one not cling to one alone,
thus adapting to things while inwardly preserving its truth,
outwardly appearing corrupt.

The Great Square has no corners—
A corner is where angles meet the earth.
The Great Square has no boundaries to exhaust,
thus it has no corners.

Great vessels take long to mature—
What is accumulated over time
when unleashed must be vast,
so great vessels are never hastened to completion.

Great sound is rare in tone,
great form is shapeless—
the Way is hidden, nameless.
The *Classics* say: *"Listening yet not hearing is called rare"* (希),
thus great sound is rare in tone.
The *Classics* say: *"The formless form"* (无象之象),
thus great form is shapeless.
Though these transcend sight and hearing,
yet in the unseen they are known,
and in the voiceless there is harmony—
how could they not be manifest in perception?

These are the twelve ways
the Way is sometimes hidden, sometimes revealed,
embodied in things,
while the Way’s fullness remains hidden in the nameless.

Only the Way is both generous and complete—
*"Acquit"* (贷) means to bestow,
*"Complete"* (成) means things rely on it to succeed.
---
**Forty-first Chapter** (*Riverbank* on *Same and Different*)
This chapter speaks of the Way’s fullness,
difficult for the middle and lower ranks to know.
For the Way is formless and nameless,
thus cannot be attained by deliberate action.
Only by sinking deep and immersing oneself
does the Way itself take residence—
this is how the Way generously bestows upon all things,
completing its boundless, selfless wholeness.

Thus the ancient scholars cultivated for themselves
yet ultimately achieved success for all—
this is embodying the Way.

The Way gives birth to One,
One generates Two,
Two generates Three,
Three generates all things.
Master Zhu Wen (朱文公) said:
*The Way is the *Taiji* of the *Yijing*,
One is the oddness of Yang,
Two is the pairing of Yin,
Three is the accumulation of odd and paired.
When it says "Two generates Three,"
it means Two and One make Three.
When it says "Three generates all things,"
it means the union of odd and paired gives birth to all things.
If one simply takes One as the *Taiji*,
then it cannot be said that the Way generates One—
this aligns with Liezi’s claim that the *Yijing* transforms into One.
The so-called "One" is merely the beginning of transformation,
not the abstract number One.

All things carry Yin on their backs and embrace Yang,
their vital breath harmonized.
For living beings,
their backs face rearward—Yin’s stillness—
while mouths, noses, ears, and eyes face forward—Yang’s activity,
thus "carry Yin and embrace Yang."
As for plants,
they turn toward warmth and away from cold,
while vital breath circulates between.
In broader terms,
the spirit is Yang, substance is Yin—
the spirit moves within as "embracing,"
substance manifests externally as "carrying."
Qi moves as dynamic Yang and stasis Yin,
balanced by central harmony,
filling form and substance,
the mechanism upon which the spirit rides.
Master Wen (温公) said:
All things take Yin and Yang as their essence,
and central harmony as their function.
Master Wenjian (文简) said:
When Yin and Yang qi are imbalanced,
or when they intermingle and harmonize,
this is the exchange of Two to form Three,
the pervasion of Three to form all things.

What people detest—
the lonely, the orphaned, the childless—
the king and duke hold as virtues.
Thus things may be diminished yet benefit,
or benefited yet diminished.
*"Evil"* (恶), pronounced *wù*—
Master Wen said:
*"Fullness invites loss, humility invites gain."*
This is to avoid extremes and approach central harmony.

What people teach,
I also teach with my *Yi*.
The tyrannical meet no good end—
I will take them as my teaching fathers.
*"Strong"* (强), pronounced *qiáng*.
If one knows the principle of diminishing and benefiting thus,
then all teaching should follow my *Kun* and harmonious *Yi*—
knowing the tyrannical reach their extreme
yet still meet no good end.
This is especially so—
thus I say, *"I will take them as my teaching fathers."*
*"Father"* (父) is the root.
Though teaching is the master’s way,
masters are honored yet distant,
while fathers are honored and intimate—
thus there is no hidden meaning.
As the *Yijing* says:
*"Without a teacher or guardian,
it is as if facing one’s parents."*
This is the same intent.
Now, speaking specifically of *"father"*
emphasizes the severity of teaching.
---
**Forty-second Chapter** (*Riverbank* on *Dao’s Transformation*)
This chapter speaks of the Way embodied in Yin and Yang,
giving birth to all things,
all relying on central harmony for function.

The softest in the world
overcomes the hardest in the world—
no gap exists in the unbroken,
thus one knows the benefits of *non-action*.
*"Interval"* (间), pronounced *jiàn*.
Only the Way is formless, thus *"the softest."*
Only things have substance, thus *"the hardest."*
*"Galloping"* (驰骋) means to transform and employ.
The Way’s marvelous transformation
is to agitate the substantial with the formless.

The Way’s essence is nonexistent,
yet it generates all forms—
Tai Mountain, autumnal hair—
they rely on it to take shape.
Thus when it enters things,
initially there is no separation.
The Way’s essence encompasses all,
neither existence nor nonexistence
are confined within—
mysteriously seamless, no gaps exist.
This is the Way within things,
things within the Way—
all without gaps.

If one embodies this,
nature and essence harmonize,
boundlessly effortless,
benefits endless.

Master Wéndìng (文定) said:
Only the sage can practice *non-action*,
thus employing all strength,
entering and exiting all existence.
Silent teaching, benefits of *non-action*—
few in the world attain this.

*"Rare"* (希), meaning *"scarce."*
Master Wáng Fǔsì (王辅嗣) said:
The softest cannot be bent,
nothing cannot be exhausted.
Extending this reasoning,
one knows *non-action* benefits things—
who can surpass this?
---
**Forty-third Chapter** (*Riverbank* on *Universal Application*)
This chapter praises the benefits of emptiness, softness, and *non-action*.

---

**Forty-fourth Chapter** (*Riverbank* on *Establishing Precepts*)
What is closer: name or body?
What is more abundant: body or wealth?
The body is the vessel of the spirit—
how could it not be close?
The name is a guest of reality—
how could it be revered?

Moreover, the body is singular,
while external things are boundless.
If one abandons the body for the sake of name,
enslaving the singular to seek the abundant—
foolishness knows no greater extreme.

For when a person expands the Dao,
the body becomes the Dao’s foundation.
Master Wéndìng said:
If one forgets the self,
the body itself is not possessed—
how much more so name and wealth?

Gain or loss—
which is the greater affliction?
Master Wēngōng said:
To gain name and wealth while losing the body,
or to gain the body while losing name and wealth—
which is the greater affliction?

Master Wéndìng said:
Not to gain is to suffer loss,
but once gained, loss is already present—
what further affliction can there be?

Thus, excessive love brings great expenditure;
to hurl a **Hísì** pearl at a thousand-**rèn** high bird,
both are instances of excessive love’s delusion.

Excessive hoarding brings great loss.
No hoarding means nothing to lose.
**Kāiyuán** annotated:
Excessive love of name exhausts the spirit—
is this not great expenditure?
Excessive hoarding of wealth burdens the body—
is this not great loss?

Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace,
knowing restraint brings no peril—
thus one can endure long.

Only by discerning the distinction between inner and outer
does one know restraint and sufficiency,
and escape the calamity of gain and loss—
therefore one can abide in the constancy of life and death,
and what peril or disgrace remains?
This is why one can endure long.
The **Han**’s two **còu** commentaries once expounded upon these words.

---

**Forty-fifth Chapter** (*Riverbank* on *Abundant Virtue*)
This chapter speaks of embodying the Dao’s completeness
and thus becoming the standard for all under heaven.

Some say:
If one is complete yet not as if deficient,
full yet not as if void,
straight yet not as if bent,
clever yet not as if clumsy,
eloquent yet not as if tongue-tied—
this is merely the agitation that cannot be tranquil,
the tranquility that cannot be agitated.

Agitation can conquer cold but not heat;
tranquility can conquer heat but not cold—
both are constrained by one-sidedness.
Yet only the serene and tranquil
transcends the definitions of complete/deficient,
eloquent/tongue-tied—
and thus nothing remains unconquered.
This is why it becomes the standard for all under heaven
and fulfills its great purpose.

When the Dao prevails under heaven,
warhorses are driven back to manure the fields;
When the Dao does not prevail under heaven,
warhorses breed in the suburbs.

「却，与部同，除去也。
*This is the same as "除" (to remove or eliminate).*

粪，治田畴也。
*Manure, which nourishes the fields.*

戎马者，备战之马也。
*Warhorses are those kept ready for battle.*

郊者，二国相交之境也。
*The suburbs are the borderlands where two states meet.*

以内言之，心君泰然，
*Speaking inwardly, when the heart-mind (心君) is serene and at ease,*

则却返气马以培粪其本根，
*it drives back the restless qi-warhorses (气马) to manure and nourish the roots of its foundation.*

反是则意马驰於外境矣。
*But if it is otherwise, the mind-warhorses (意马) gallop unrestrained into external distractions.*

罪莫大於可欲，
*No crime is greater than the pursuit of what can be desired,*

祸莫大於不知足，
*No calamity is greater than the ignorance of contentment,*

咎莫大於欲得。
*No blame is greater than the greed to acquire.*

究其根本，原於纵欲。
*Examining their roots, they stem from indulging desires.*

文定曰：匹夫有一於身，患必及之。
*Wéndìng says: If even a common man harbors such things within himself, misfortune will surely follow him.*

侯王而为是，必戎马之所自起。
*If a lord or king indulges in them, warhorses will inevitably arise from his own domain.*

故知足之足，常足矣。
*Thus, the contentment of contentment is everlasting contentment.*

黄茂村曰：一性之内，无欠无余。
*Huáng Màocūn says: Within the singular nature (一性), there is neither lack nor excess.*

人能安之，无适不足。
*If one can settle upon it, there is no place where it is not sufficient.*

---

**Chapter 46**
*River Upper (河上) names it "Moderation in Desire (俭欲)."*
*This chapter warns against the harm of avaricious pursuit and values contentment as a constant.*

不出户，知天下；
*Without stepping beyond one's door, one knows all under heaven;*

不窥牖，见天道。
*without peering through the window, one sees the Dao of heaven and earth.*

天地万物同出於道，
*Heaven, earth, and all things arise from the same Dao,*

反身而诚，万物皆备。
*returning inwardly and being genuine (诚), one possesses all things.*

温公曰：得其宗本故也。
*Wēngōng says: This is because one has attained its fundamental source (宗本).*

其出弥远，其知弥少。
*The farther one goes from it, the less one knows.*

温公曰：迷本逐末也。
*Wēngōng says: This is because one becomes lost in the roots (本) and pursues the extremities (末).*

是以圣人不行而知，不见而名，不为而成。
*Therefore, the sage does not act yet knows, does not see yet names, does not do yet accomplishes.*

盖清明在躬，无为而已。
*For clarity and serenity reside within oneself, and that is all there is to doing (无为).*

温公曰：至理不易也。
*Wēngōng says: This is the unchanging ultimate truth (至理).*

---

**Chapter 47**
*River Upper (河上) names it "Discerning the Distant (鉴远)."*
*This chapter states that true understanding can transcend the limits of perception and hearing, hence the sage’s ability to transform without action.*

为学日益，为道日损。
*In the pursuit of learning, one gains daily; in the pursuit of the Dao, one diminishes daily.*

损之又损，以至於无为，
*Diminish again and again, until one reaches the state of non-action (无为),*

无为而无不为矣。
*then one can do without doing, and nothing remains undone.*

开元注云：因益以积功，忘功而体道。
*Kāiyuán’s annotation says: One accumulates merit through learning (因益), then forgets merit and embodies the Dao (体道).*

故取天下常以无事，
*Thus, to govern all under heaven, one must rely on non-interference (无事),*

及其有事，不足以取天下。
*but when one must intervene, it is insufficient to govern all under heaven.*

取者，取而化之也，
*The act of taking means to take and transform (化),*

盖克已复礼而天下归仁之意。
*for it is the intention of subduing oneself and returning to propriety (复礼), so that all under heaven may find virtue (归仁).*

黄茂村曰：无所不知，而后可以言学，
*Huáng Màocūn says: Only when one knows nothing that can be known (无所不知), can one speak of learning (学),*

故学欲日益。
*hence learning must be daily increased (日益).*

益者已化，然后可以言道，
*What is gained must already be transformed (已化), then one can speak of the Dao (道),*

故道欲日损。
*hence the Dao must be daily diminished (日损).*

然益者可以进，
*However, what is gained can be advanced (进),*

损者不可强损，
*but what is diminished cannot be forcibly reduced (强损),*

而未能兼忘其损，未为损也。
*and until one can simultaneously forget what is diminished, it is not yet true diminishing.*

直须瞥地脱落，
*Only when one suddenly abandons all attachments (瞥地脱落),*

前后际断，
*and severs the past and future (际断),*

乃至无为之地，
*reaching the state of non-action (无为),*

故能无所不为，而应用不穷，
*then one can do without doing (无所不为), and its applications are boundless (应用不穷),*

施於天下，绰绰然矣。
*acting upon all under heaven with effortless grace (绰绰然).*

---

**Chapter 48**
*River Upper (河上) names it "Forgetting Knowledge (忘知)."*
*This chapter speaks of the virtue of emptying knowledge to attain boundless Dao.*

圣人无常心，
*The sage has no fixed mind (常心),*

以百姓心为心。
*but takes the hearts of the common people (百姓心) as his own.*

惟圣人无我，
*Only the sage is without self (无我),*

故其心不滞於一，
*thus his mind is not constrained by one thing,*

而物来顺应矣。
*and things come and respond in accordance.*

善者吾善之，不善者吾亦善之，
*To the virtuous, I am virtuous; to the non-virtuous, I am also virtuous,*

德善矣。
*thus my virtue is ever-virtuous.*

信者吾信之，不信者吾亦信之，
*To the trustworthy, I trust them; to the untrustworthy, I trust them also,*

德信矣。
*thus my virtue is ever-trustworthy.*

御注云：舜之於象，所以善信者至矣。
*The Imperial annotation says: As Shun (舜) treated the Ox (象), his virtue of being virtuous and trustworthy was supreme.*

人之有生，同具此理。
*All who are born share this same principle.*

圣人於人，莫不皆以善信遇之，
*The sage, in dealing with people, meets all with virtue and trust,*

此圣人之德量也。
*this is the measure of the sage’s virtue.*

盖善不善、信不信在彼，
*For virtue and non-virtue, trust and non-trust lie in others,*

而吾之善信未尝渝，
*yet my own virtue and trust never waver (未尝渝),*

此圣德之善信矣。
*this is the sage’s virtue of being ever-virtuous and ever-trustworthy.*

苟善善信信而绝其不善不信者，
*If one were to be virtuous toward the virtuous and trustworthy toward the trustworthy while severing the non-virtuous and untrustworthy,*

则岂所谓常善救而不弃哉。
*then would it not be contrary to the saying that the sage always rescues the virtuous and does not abandon them?*

圣人之在天下，惵惵为天下浑其心。
*The sage, in his presence under heaven, is diligently blending (浑) the hearts of all.*

百姓皆注其耳目，
*All the common people focus their ears and eyes upon him,*

圣人皆孩之。
*and the sage treats them all as infants (孩).*

惵，图协切，忧勤貌。
*"惵" (diligently), pronounced *túxié*, means anxious and industrious.*

为，去声。
*"为" here is pronounced with the departing tone (去声).*

浑，与混同，胡本切。
*"浑" (blending), the same as "混" (mingling), is pronounced *húběn*.*

天下之善恶信伪，皆未知所定，
*As for the virtue and non-virtue, trust and deceit of all under heaven, they are all yet undetermined,*

圣人则惵惵然为天下浑心，
*yet the sage diligently blends (浑心) their hearts,*

盖欲融化其异而混合其同，
*for he seeks to dissolve their differences and merge their likenesses,*

故无善恶，无信伪，
*thus there is neither virtue nor non-virtue, neither trust nor deceit,*

皆一以待之。
*but he treats them all with a singular response.*

彼方注其耳巨，以观圣人之予夺，
*They focus their ears and eyes to observe whether the sage gives or withholds,*

吾皆以婴孩遇之，
*and I meet them all as infants (婴孩),*

若保赤子，
*like cherishing a newborn babe,*

此圣人之诚心也，
*this is the sincerity of the sage’s heart,*

则彼亦将释然而自化矣。
*and thus they will also relax and transform of their own accord.*

皆孩之意，谓不生分别也。
*The meaning of "treat them all as infants" is that no distinctions are made.*

---

The response to *"why is it so?"* lies in the depth of its **generative vitality (生生)**—
this is the answer’s phrasing.

It means that though one seeks to thicken life’s abundance, they cannot forget the self,
and thus are driven by delusion into the realm of death.

For those drowned in the pursuit of life must inevitably meet death as its counterpart,
while those who dwell beyond life and death—where no duality exists—
remain oblivious, hence the *Classic* says:
*"Only those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who prize it."*

Some say delusive thoughts proliferate endlessly—
this too is the extreme of **generative vitality (生生)**—
and it is also acceptable.

If one can cultivate stillness to nourish **pure clarity (虚明)**,
then movement never departs from stillness,
and movement and stillness are both forgotten—
this is the conduct of those who excel in **life-nurturing (摄生)**.

As **Wen Ding** says:
*"The followers of life and death, each occupying three parts of ten,
do they not amount to nine parts of life and death,
while the **Dao of neither life nor death** stands alone?"*

Neither life nor death is what the *Yijing* calls **"serene and unmoving."**
Laozi speaks of the nine but omits the one,
leaving it to the seeker to realize,
and thus entrusts the subtlety of **non-thinking, non-action (无思无为)**.

It is said that those who excel in **life-nurturing (摄生)**
walk on land without encountering rhinoceros or tiger,
enter battlefields without bearing armor.
The rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,
the tiger no place to strike with its claws,
the blade no place to find its edge.

*Why is this?*
Because there is no realm of death.
*"Rhinoceros"* sounds similar.
The *Shan Hai Jing* says:
*"The rhinoceros emerges from the southern banks of the Xiang River,
with a blackish hue."*
The *Er Ya* says:
*"Its form resembles a wild ox, yet it has but one horn."*
This is the language of modesty—
one does not dare speak of oneself.

When the **returning flow is whole and unified (反流全一)**,
when the gathered thoughts dissolve into **non-being (归无)**,
this is the conduct of those who excel in **life-nurturing (摄生)**—
as **Guan Yin** said: *"Forgetting vitality and transcending life."*

Thus, even the *one* is not established,
and so their **heavenly defense (天守)** remains intact,
their **spirit (神)** unassailable,
and nothing can enter them of its own accord.
Thus numbers cannot constrain them,
calamities cannot reach them,
and even the realm of life is absent—
how could there be a realm of death?

Hence it is said: *"The Perfect One has no self,
and aligns with the Dao in unity."*

---
**Chapter Fifty**
Named *"Noble Life"* by **He Shang**

This chapter clarifies that those who excel in **life-nurturing (摄生)**
take **non-action (无为)** as their ultimate principle,
thus able to evade calamities and transcend life and death.

Yet interpretations vary:
**He Shang Gong**, **Han Fei**, **Bi Xu Zi**, **Ye Mengde**, and **Lin Dong**
all take the **four limbs and nine orifices** as thirteen,
with movement and stillness belonging to life and death.
The ignorant harm themselves through reckless action,
and movement aligns with evil, leading to the realm of death.

If so, then the followers of death and the realm of death’s movement
are indistinguishable—
what more can be said of mere form?

**Du Guangcheng** takes the **ten evils and three actions** as thirteen,
and there are also those who speak of **seven emotions and six desires**.

**Li Wenchou** says:
*"The kidneys are **Kan (坎)**, the gate of life.
The heart is **Li (离)**, the door of death."*
Each completes a cycle of twelve branches,
waning and renewing—
this makes thirteen,
yet it omits the thirteen of the realm of death’s movement.

The **Kaiyuan Commentary**, **Sun Deng**, **Sima**, **Shao**, **Wang**, and **Cao**
all say:
*"Among ten people, three belong to each category—
roughly, those who preserve life through gentleness occupy three of ten,
those who hasten death through rigidity occupy three of ten,
and those who, though loving life, inevitably trend toward death also occupy three of ten."*

**Cao** says:
*"Those who cultivate longevity are followers of life,
those who cultivate quiescence are followers of death,
and those who indulge in desires and reckless action
all trend toward the realm of death."*

**Shu Zhao Shi** further takes the **five-phase life-death numerology** as thirteen,
using the following method:
*Jia-Ji-Zi-Wu* nine, *Yi-Geng-Chou-Wei* eight,
*Heng-Xin-Yin-Shen* seven, *Ding-Wen-Mao-You* six,
*Si-Hai* alone stands at four—
this sums to thirteen.
For example: water is born in *Shen* (seven), dies in *Mao* (six),
totaling thirteen.
This can be extended similarly—
thus the *Classic* should say *"the thirteen followers of life and death"* instead.

**Huang Ri** says:
*"Water’s complete number is six,
fire’s complete number is seven—
together, thirteen."*
Though many recent commentaries adopt this,
who can say such hasty compilation must be so?
Moreover, why single out two of the five phases,
and why discard the life-generating numbers while taking only the complete numbers?
What is the meaning of this?

There are also those who say:
*"From the kidneys’ water rising into the heart,
this is the birth-and-death cycle."*
They even cite **Zhang Pingzhu’s** poem:
*"Thirteen wrapped in yin, six and seven in yang"*
as proof.

So-called **life-nurturing (摄生)** is thus taking **Kan’s substance**
to punctuate **Li’s void**—
until, in the absence of death’s realm,
one transforms into the **Great Receptive (乾)**.

Their theory seems plausible yet strays from the *Classic’s* intent.

**Wen Ding** says:
*"Those who use things to extract essence for self-nourishment
are followers of life.
Those who indulge in sounds, colors, odors, and flavors
harm themselves—these are followers of death."*
Having thus divided the paths of life and death,
I also know deceit yet fail to know stillness,
know speech yet fail to know silence,
know thought yet fail to know forgetting—
and thus rush toward exhaustion.
This is what is called the **realm of death’s movement**.

Yet **Qing Yuan Zi’s** view is similar—
but the followers of death and the realm of death’s movement
are indistinct.
This is why I alone clarify that **qi’s extension and contraction**
are the followers of life and death,
while **entering into use** is the realm of death’s movement.

For the **Dao of Immortality** values life,
and thus cherishes the **yang qi of generation**—
how much more so the **Heavenly Dao**?

The **Dao of Ghosts** values termination,
and thus clings to the **yin qi of decay**—
death on earth.

The **Human Dao** values the **heart-mind (#1)**,
and thus can both live and die—
for **qi in use** is moderate and balanced—
how much more so for humanity?

As for the **one of neither life nor death**,
it is not numbered yet numbers flow through it,
not used yet use is accomplished—
this is the **embodiment of the Dao (尸乎道)**.

This is how it circulates beyond the three,
yet is not confined by them.

The *Classic of the Dao* speaks of the three uses and one non-use—
just as the three (Heaven, Earth, humanity) die in their own ways,
while the one (Dao) transcends them all.

Thus, the interplay of **Elemental Changes** (元亨利贞) is called the **harmonious number**—
between **Virtue (贞)** and **Primordial (元)**, there lies the **extreme of being and non-being**,
and thus it is **numberless**.

Numberless, it abides in the **kernel of the Dao**—
the ancients rightly saw **Kang Jie** as grasping **Laozi’s intent**.

The Dao **gives birth** to all things,
**Virtue (德)** nurtures them,
**Form (物)** manifests them,
**Momentum (#2)** completes them—
thus all things cannot but **revere the Dao** and **honor Virtue**.

The Dao’s reverence, Virtue’s nobility—
none can bestow them, yet they abide **naturally and eternally**.

The Dao is the **Mother of all things**,
while Virtue is the Dao **embodied within us**.

In Heaven and Earth, it is **Heaven and Earth’s Virtue**;
in the Sage, it is the **Sage’s Virtue**.

The Dao is the **origin of perpetual generation**,
while Virtue **tends to the multitude without arrogance**.

Without Virtue, all things cannot fulfill their **destiny**—
hence it is called **nurturing**.

**Form** is but the **manifestation of Dao and Virtue**,
while **Momentum (#2)** is the **interdependent principle** by which all things arise.

Thus, how could one fail to **venerate the root**?
Hence all revere the Dao and honor Virtue.

To receive one’s mandate from **Heaven** makes one the **Son of Heaven**,
to receive it from the **Son of Heaven** makes one a **feudal lord**—
where there is a mandate received, the one who grants it can **debase the other**.
Yet the Dao precedes all things in **ordaining their fates**—
who then could **confer rank upon it**?

Only **bestowal and deprivation** belong to none but itself,
thus it abides **naturally and eternally**, and so is **revered and noble**.

The Dao **gives birth, nurtures, lengthens, matures, completes, ripens, nourishes, and shelters**.
It **generates without possession**, **acts without reliance**, **lengthens without domination**—
this is called **Mysterious Virtue**.

*Lengthen* (長) is pronounced with a rising tone.

These eight are the **primordial functions of the Great Dao**,
and **non-possession, non-reliance, non-domination** all stem from **selflessness**—
this is the **ultimate of Virtue**, profound and distant, hence **Mysterious Virtue**.

The meanings of the eight:
**Generates** (生) is to **provide the beginning**,
**Nurtures** (畜) is to **encompass fully**,
**Lengthens** (長) is to **fulfill their form**,
**Matures** (育) is to **refine their substance**,
**Completes** (成) is to **assist their function**,
**Ripens** (熟) is to **fulfill their time**,
**Nourishes** (养) is to **preserve their harmony**,
**Shelters** (覆) is to **guard against harm**.

Though it begins with **Virtue nurturing**, all ultimately return to the **Dao**—
for nothing is outside the Dao.

Though it starts with the **Dao**, it ends with **Mysterious Virtue**—
for without **ultimate Virtue**, the **Great Dao** would not solidify.
In truth, they are one.

**Chapter 51: *He Shang* on Nurturing Virtue**

This chapter elucidates the **wondrous root** and the **responsive generation** of all things,
clarifying why all things **revere the Dao and honor Virtue**,
then praises the **functions of generation and nurturing**,
and finally extols the **Virtue of forgetting merit**.

**Heaven and Earth** have a beginning,
and thus are called the **Mother of all things**.

Having obtained the **Mother**, one knows her **children**;
having known the **children**, one must **return to guard the Mother**—
then one’s life will never perish.

Before Heaven and Earth existed, the Dao **eternally stood**,
yet all things **draw from this beginning to be born**—
thus it is called **Mother**.

Once the **origin is obtained**, the **Mother is known**,
and thus the **form is established**.

Moreover, one must discern that the Dao **never ceases to be present within all things**—
for all that **draws from the Dao to be born** are its **children**.
Thus, by **turning back to examine the children**, one’s understanding is boundless.

Having known the **children**, one must not **lose the root for the branches**,
hence the admonition to **return and guard the Mother**.

If humanity **abides in effortless spontaneity**,
and remains **pure without ceasing**,
then all things and all affairs will **each find their place**—
there is no other method, nor any intention to **guard** it.

**Responding to things** is **transformation**,
**Within oneself** is **the numinous**—
such is all there is.

The **substance of the Dao** is **indistinctly unified**,
and thus is the **single source** from which all differences arise—
hence, by obtaining the **Mother**, one knows the **children**.

The **function of the Dao** is **boundless**,
and thus the **single source** gives rise to all differences—
hence, by knowing the **children**, one must **return and guard the Mother**.

Thus, one **unifies beginning and end, essence and manifestation**,
and **returns to the origin while completing the cycle**—
then **life and death bring no confusion**,
hence it is said: **"One’s life will never perish."**

**Seal your joy (兑)**, **close your gates**—
then your whole life will be **unlabored**.
**Open your joy**, **pursue your affairs**—
then your whole life will be **unsaved**.

The *Classic of Changes* says: **"Joy (兑) is delight."**
When the **heart-mind** indulges in **pleasure and attachment**, it is **defiled**.

**Gates** are the **portals of the senses**.
To **seal** and **close** is to instruct the learner in **guarding the Mother**—
that is, to **restrain speech**, **moderate diet**, **quiet emotions**, **preserve the spirit-qi**,
to **view and listen with propriety**, to **move and rest in harmony**—
these are all ways to **nourish the form and cultivate Virtue**,
and thus one’s life will **flourish without toil**.

If one does the opposite—
abandoning the **inner** while **pursuing external delight**—
then one’s life will be **endlessly exhausted**, yet **never saved**.

**Seeing what is small** is called **clarity**,
**holding to gentleness** is called **strength**.

**Using its light**, yet **returning to its clarity**—
without **leaving behind calamity**—
this is called **inheriting constancy**.

*遗 (遗)* is pronounced as *yí* (with the *yì* rhyme), meaning **to leave behind**.

Only the **Dao is formless**—
it cannot be **seen with the eyes**, hence it is **small**;
it cannot be **obtained by force**, hence it is **gentle**.

To **perceive it precisely** without **being obscured by things** is **clarity**;
to **hold to it steadfastly** without **being taken by things** is **strength**.

The scholar, **concentrating the mind** and **deliberating deeply**,
**sets it down and savors it**—
then the **nurturing function** is achieved.

Moreover, **seeing** and **holding** are the **practices of cultivation**,
while **clarity** and **strength** are the **manifest effects**.

**Clarity** is the **substance**,
**Light** is the **function**—
saying that the **still-stored substance** is established,
then the **active perception** must necessarily follow,
just as the **light of clarity** illuminates things—
the **substance remains unharmed**, while the **function is boundless**.

Yet one must also **harmonize the light without dazzling**,
**conceal the wisdom in ignorance**,
then **retreat into obscurity**—
and thus **calamities cannot reach**.

This is called **properly transmitting the eternal Dao**.

「Thus, the **virtue/power** grows ever more profound, the mind becomes ever more humble.
When one reaches this state, there is no lingering calamity to fear—
this is the **language of the cultivator**.

**Chapter 52**—*He Shang* names it **"Returning to the Origin, Reverting to the Root"**.
This chapter elucidates the **Dao/Way of returning to the source and embracing the root**.
Some say that the **origin** is **qi**—
for all mortals are born from **qi**, thus **qi** is the **mother**,
while the **spirit** abides within **qi**, hence the **child**.
When **mother** and **child** are in harmony, the **spirit** is tranquil and the **qi** is focused—
this too is the **initial mechanism for entering the Dao**.

If one were to say, *"I possess knowledge and walk the Great Dao,"*
only **deeds** would be worthy of fear.
The Great Dao is vast and unobstructed,
with neither origin nor end—
it cannot be grasped by **intellect** nor discerned by **perception**,
for it is without contrivance or deliberate action.
Now, if one were to say, *"I possess knowledge and walk the Great Dao,"*
this mind has already begun to **lean upon** and **cling to** something—
thus, only such **deliberate actions** are truly worthy of fear.

For the previous chapter exhorted one to **guard the mother** in practice,
this chapter now warns against the **harm of contrivance**.
The Great Dao is most **plain and simple**,
yet mortals prefer **shortcuts**.
*"Good"* (read with falling tone)—
The *Ding Guan Jing* says:
*"To seek the Dao against the Dao,
to resent the Dao yet lack compassion for it."*
Indeed, preferring **shortcuts** means one will never reach the **principle**.
The **palace** is **exhausted** by **excessive adornment**,
and the **heart** is **overwrought** by **excessive scheming**—
this is **internal depletion**.
If speaking of the **body**, then the **palace** is the **three fields**—
the **storehouse** is where **vital essence and qi** dwell,
such as the **stomach** being the **Great Granary**.
To **don fine attire** and **wear sharp blades**,
to **overindulge in food** while **wealth overflows**,
is called **plundering and boasting**—
this is **not the Dao**!
*"Overindulge"* means **excess**.
All these are **failures to cultivate internally** while **ostentatiously displaying externally**—
this is **teaching plunder**,
how could it be the **practice of the Great Dao**?
The **Wen Gong** says:
*"To wear beauty without propriety,
to gorge on food without satiety—
thus it is called **plundering and boasting**."*
Why does such **boasting** arise?
Is it not because one **desires to practice the Dao** yet **further digresses into political scheming**?

**Chapter 53**—*He Shang* names it **"Further Validation"**.
This chapter states that **knowledge alone is insufficient to illuminate the Dao**,
preferring **shortcuts is insufficient to walk the Dao**,
and that **unverified is mistaken for verified**,
**unobtained is mistaken for obtained**—
all these are **not the Dao**.

*"The well-established will not be uprooted,
the well-embraced will not be cast off,
and descendants continue in **sacrifice** without ceasing."*
The Dao **encompasses** the heavens and earth,
**permeates** the ancient and the present,
**embraces** all above and below without being uprooted,
**circulates** through all transformations without being cast off—
when **yin** and **yang** alternate, the **new** arises from the **old**,
just as descendants **inherit** without end.
The cultivator must first **establish the central** to **ground their foundation**,
then **rootedness** will be **unshakable**;
embrace **oneness** to **focus their vigilance**,
then **attachment** will be **unbreakable**.
When **virtue/power** flourishes and **benefits others**,
the **later awakened** will **revere it**—
until its **source is deep and its current long**,
passed down through generations,
evermore **intimate** with time.

The **Wen Gong** says:
*"The **unrooted** is **deep-rooted and firmly established**, **unshakable**.
The **uncast off** is **the people’s hearts in submission**, **unsubverted**.
The **unceasing** is **long-lasting prosperity**."*
Cultivate it **within oneself**, and its **virtue/power** becomes **true**;
cultivate it **within the family**, and its **virtue/power** becomes **abundant**;
cultivate it **within the village**, and its **virtue/power** becomes **enduring**;
cultivate it **within the state**, and its **virtue/power** becomes **prosperous**;
cultivate it **throughout the world**, and its **virtue/power** becomes **universal**.
**True** means **unfeigned**;
**abundant** means **effortlessly ample**;
**enduring** means **nothing is beyond its reach**;
**prosperous** means **nothing is lacking**;
**universal** means **nothing is excluded**.
For the Dao’s **truth** lies in **self-cultivation**,
its **overflow** in **governing others**—
yet cultivating it **within oneself** is the **principle**.
Extending it to **family, state, and world**,
it remains **no different in essence**.
The **Wen Gong** says:
*"All follow the **root** to govern the **branches**,
from the **near** to the **far**."*

Thus, one **observes the body** through the **body**,
the **family** through the **family**,
the **village** through the **village**,
the **state** through the **state**,
the **world** through the **world**.
How do I know the **world** is thus?
Because of this.
The **method of observation** is **not distant**—
why seek it elsewhere?
Though **things differ in outward division**,
they share **one root**—
to observe them thus, none will fail to align.
This meaning should be **silently grasped beyond words**.

The *Kai Yuan* commentary says:
*"By the **method of self-cultivation**,
one observes the **true nature of the body**—
its **origin** is **pure and cool**;
once **seen**, all **perceptions** are **discarded**;
knowing **emptiness**, even **emptiness** is **discarded**—
abandoning **both extremes**, one **suddenly harmonizes** with the **Middle Dao**,
thus **truly attuned**."*

**Chapter 54**—*He Shang* names it **"Cultivation Through Observation"**.
This chapter elucidates **cultivating oneself and extending to all things**.
The broader the **cultivation**, the farther its **reach**.
**Knowledge** and **rectification of things** are **no different** in essence.

The **depth of virtue/power** is **like that of an infant**.
**Nurturing** the **most profound virtue/power**,
as if one were a **babe**.
**Venomous insects** do not **sting**,
**ferocious beasts** do not **seize**,
**raptorial birds** do not **clutch**.
*"Sting"* (pronounced *shì*)—
*"Seize"* (pronounced *jù*)—
*"Clutch"* (pronounced *bó*).
A **hollow vessel** striking another,
though **violent**, does not **rage**.
**The perfect human**—
**harmony with all things**.

*Bi Xu* says:
*"Venomous insects* (like wasps) **sting** with their tail ends;
*ferocious beasts* (like tigers and leopards) **seize** with their claws;
*raptorial birds* (like eagles and hawks) **clutch** with their talons.
**Bones weak, sinews soft**, yet **grasp firm**—
**unaware of sexual union** yet **naturally aroused**,
this is the **apex of essence**."

*"Aroused"* (pronounced *zuò*)—
The *Shuo Wen* says:
*"The infant is **yin**."*

*Wen Ding* says:
*"To hold without **grasping**,
to act without **desire**—
this is **essence in excess**, not the **mind**.
To **wail all day** yet **throat unhoarse**,
**harmony** is **perfect**.
*"Wail"* (pronounced *hào*)—**to cry**.
*"Throat"* (pronounced *yì*)—
*"Hoarse"* (pronounced *gě*)—
**to lose one’s voice**.
*Wen Ding* says:
*"When the **mind moves**, the **qi** is **injured**;
when the **qi** is **injured**, **weeping** becomes **rasping**—
thus, one knows that **stillness of the mind** brings **qi harmony**."*

**"Knowing harmony is constancy.**
*Cao* says:
*"Harmony is the natural principle of life.*
To know harmony is to be pure, still, and one—
to traverse ten thousand changes without loss."

**"Knowing constancy is clarity.**
From clarity comes vision—
this is the Dao of enduring, natural constancy.
Only by abiding in constancy does one’s Dao grow ever clearer,
thus knowing constancy brings no greater enlightenment."

**"Excessive cultivation is ominous.**
*Yi Sheng* says: *"All contrived action is excessive cultivation."*
Ominous—this is *yao* (portent).
*Da Zhen Zi* says:
*"Ominous is not the natural way."*
*Wen Ding* says:
*"Life cannot be artificially enhanced—
yet if one seeks to enhance it,
this is not the right path,
a reckless fabrication.
The Classic says:
*'Not knowing constancy, reckless action brings calamity.'*
When the mind forces *qi*, this is coercion.
If the mind moves, it cannot focus *qi* to gather softness—
this is the beginning of coercion,
the loss of the infant’s pure heart.
When things flourish, they age—
this is called *not the Dao*,
and *not the Dao* brings early decay."
*Yi* (pronounced *yǐ*), to cease.

All forced cultivation of *qi* abandons the natural way,
thus only hastening decay and aging.
If one knows it does not align with the Dao,
one should cease it early.

---
**Chapter LVI**
*River Above* names it *Xuan Fu* (Mysterious Symbol).
This chapter begins with the infant’s essence—
the pure, undivided, chaotic unity of nature’s foundation,
so nothing can penetrate it.
Thus, even grasping or wailing arises from nature alone.
At its end, it warns against even a thread of contrived thought,
for this loses the natural way.

*Huang Mao Cai* says:
*"The ancient text had no *yì* (throat) character,
and *hào* (wail) without *gě* (hoarse) is *Zhuangzi*’s style—
later scholars added it."*

The wise do not speak;
those who speak do not know.
The true Dao transcends speech and silence—
only those who embody it know it.

**Block the senses’ excess,
close the gates of perception,
dull the sharp edges,
unravel the tangled,
harmonize the radiance,
blend with the dust—
this is called *Xuan Tong* (Mysterious Unity).**
*(See Chapters IV and LVII.)*
For within and without nurture each other,
silently merging with the Dao without distinction from others.

**It cannot be approached or distanced,
cannot be used for gain or harm,
cannot be exalted or debased—
thus it is the most noble in the world.**
This describes those of *virtue/power*.

Only because it is all-encompassing yet not partial,
grasping yet roundly responsive,
meeting the boundless without fixating—
it does not dwell in any single realm.
How could the mind’s schemes ever reach it?
Thus the Master sighed like the *Yu Long* (Jade Dragon).

---
**Chapter LVII**
*River Above* names it *Xuan De* (Mysterious Virtue/Power).
This chapter speaks of the enlightened one—
forgetting speech, free of attachment,
thus inner and outer are both refined,
mysteriously unified and vast—
hence its nobility.

**Govern with rectitude, act with strategy in war,
and take the world without strife.**
How do I know this is so?

**Chapter LVII**

*River Above* says: The ancient sages were gentle yet far-reaching, capable yet near—
they had no desire for war,
only resorting to military campaigns when absolutely necessary.
Thus, governing the state with rectitude is the proper way,
while employing force in war is the expedient measure.

The world is a divine instrument—
it cannot be coerced.
Therefore, those who embody the Dao simply remain effortlessly tranquil,
though they have no conscious intention of taking the world,
yet the world naturally submits to them.

The more prohibitions a ruler imposes,
the poorer the people grow.
The more weapons a people wield,
the more corrupt the state becomes.
The more cunning they are,
the more strange objects proliferate.
The more laws are promulgated,
the more thieves and robbers arise.

If one abandons the principle of *non-action* (無為) in governance
and instead multiplies prohibitions,
the people will lose their bearings and resort to mechanical schemes.

If the ruler is likened to the world,
then the mind is the sovereign,
and *qi* (氣) is the people.
But if one clings to petty techniques,
fixates on private intelligence,
drowns in endless stratagems,
and indulges the six vices (六賊),
then *non-action* (無為) becomes impossible.

*River Above* says: When rulers multiply prohibitions,
the common people’s grievances cannot reach above—
then the people will grow impoverished and helpless.

Weapons are the tools of *power politics* (權謀).
The sovereign who practices *non-action* (無為)
simply ensures the people have no knowledge or desires.
If the sovereign and the people deceive each other through intelligence,
the people will grow cunning,
and the sovereign will grow increasingly bewildered and corrupt.

Strange objects are marvels and oddities.
If people abandon their fundamental occupations
and pursue frivolous enterprises,
then useless and extraordinary things will emerge.
If rulers fear the people’s deceit
and thus issue excessive laws to suppress it,
the people will be at a loss,
and thieves and robbers will multiply daily.

Thus the sage says:
*I practice non-action, yet the people transform themselves;
I love tranquility, yet the people align with propriety;
I remain without affairs, yet the people grow wealthy;
I have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.*
This is the natural response,
and the success of *non-action*.

**Right, the fifty-seventh chapter.**
*River Above* names it *Pure Wind* (淳風).
This chapter elucidates the governance of *non-action*.

Its governance is *mysterious and expansive* (闷闷),
its people are *pure and harmonious* (淳淳).
*Mysterious* (闷), pronounced *wǎn*, rhymes with *mò* (莫) and *bèn* (奔),
symbolizing the broad, yielding, and effortless nature of governance.

Those of *virtue/power* (德),
when it comes to matters of right and wrong,
are always clearly distinct,
yet their capacity is vast and boundless.
Thus, governing with *virtue/power*,
they do not scrutinize the common people with rigid laws.
Though it may appear to the vulgar eye
as if they do nothing,
the people are truly moved by the natural transformation,
making this the ultimate governance of purity and harmony.

Its governance is rigid and scrutinizing (察察),
its people are deficient and chaotic (缺缺).
Only those who do not know
to cultivate *virtue/power* as the foundation of governance,
and instead rely solely on cleverness,
seek to impose order on the people through laws and punishments.
But the people cannot be suddenly made uniform—
if one insists on forcing uniformity,
then injury will inevitably occur,
and thus their chaos.

This is what is called:
*harm arises from kindness, disaster lurks in fortune.*
*Disaster, oh disaster, is fortune’s companion;
fortune, oh fortune, is disaster’s shadow.*
Who knows their limits?
For it is said that disaster and fortune intertwine,
and none can know where they cease or begin.

Is there no distinction between right and wrong?
If so, then is there no fixed principle of right?
Right itself becomes expedient,
goodness itself becomes *heretical* (祆).
The people’s confusion is long-standing.

Only the worldly are bewildered by the shallow clarity of rigid laws,
and do not comprehend the completeness of the true Dao.
They cannot rest in the ultimate right,
and instead take expedient measures as the standard of right;
they cannot follow the ultimate goodness,
and instead regard heresy as goodness.

When their responses diverge,
they do not know to reflect inward
on the source of their own confusion,
but instead revere the external manifestations of right and wrong.
This is a profound and long-standing deviation from the true Dao.

It is also like governance—
unable to contain the people with broad, mysterious virtue,
and instead insisting on rigid scrutiny as the measure of goodness and right,
they fail to realize that this will lead to the very chaos they seek to avoid.
Thus, the following passage urges the cultivation of the sage’s virtue.

The *Kai Yuan* (開元) annotation says:
*When beings cling to delusion,*
*the truly right is seen as cunning deceit,*
*and the truly good is seen as heretical strangeness.*
Thus, disaster and fortune intertwine,
as if there were no true rightness at all.

Hence the sage is square yet not rigid,
only acting squarely while embodying rounded virtue—
thus no trace of rigid division remains.
Frugal yet not harmful,
clear yet accommodating—
thus no injury occurs.
Straightforward yet not domineering,
for great straightness seems like bending—
thus no forceful imposition.
Luminous yet not dazzling,
returning to its natural brightness.

---

Thus, these four [qualities] are all the governance of **frugality** (*jǐn*).
Indeed, the sage alone practices tranquility, simplicity, and non-action,
while employing the methods of **square** (*fāng*), **ease** (*kāng*), **straightness** (*zhí*), and **luminosity** (*guāng*).
They naturally arise within him, yet others remain unaware—
allowing all under heaven to follow their own nature and destiny,
without falling into one-sided extremes.
Thus, there is no fault of **rigid division** (*割截*), **harmful injury** (*刿*), **forceful imposition** (*肆*), or **dazzling excess** (*耀*).
Where then do disaster and fortune arise?

**Chapter 58** – *Hé Shàng* names it **Harmonious Transformation** (*Shùn Huà*).
This passage seeks to guide the people away from cleverness and artifice,
following the Dao of heaven to dispel their narrow, deceptive perceptions.

The *Zhēn* (*真*) and *Dào* (*道*) *Zhēn Jīng* (*真经*) *Jí Jiě* (*集解*) states:
**#1** *The noble Dao of humanity is the heart* – Originally read as *"The noble Dao of humanity is in the heart"* (*人道者心*), corrected according to the *Shí Wàn Běn* (*十万本*) to *"The noble Dao of humanity is the heart"* (*人道贵心*).
**#2** *Those who cling to appearances* – Originally read as *"Those who cling to things"* (*执者*), corrected according to the *Shí Wàn Běn* (*十万本*) to *"Those who cling to appearances"* (*势者*).

In governing humanity and serving heaven,
nothing surpasses **frugality** (*jǐn*).
**Frugality** (*jǐn*)—when applied to music and sound—
refrains from excessive display, embodying restraint, concealment, and steadfastness.

Those who study the Dao long enough
will broaden their heart and fill their **qi** (*氣*),
thus attaining the fullness of **heavenly virtue** (*天德*).
This is the **"ultimate sincerity"** (*至诚*) that exhausts one’s own nature,
and only then can one exhaust the nature of others—
reaching even to the point of harmonizing with heaven and earth.

Indeed, the principle of humanity and heaven is one,
with no separation at all.

*Mèng Shì* (*孟氏*) says:
*"To preserve the heart and nurture one’s nature*
*is the way to serve heaven."*

Only through **frugality** (*jǐn*) can one return early,
and returning early is called **repeatedly accumulating virtue** (*重积德*).
**Repeatedly** (*重*)—pronounced with a falling tone—means *again*.
*Wén Gōng* (*文公*) says:
*"Returning early"* refers to the ability to correct faults without delay.
**Repeatedly accumulating virtue** means that one has already amassed some virtue,
and through **frugality** (*jǐn*), nurtures it further—
this is another layer of accumulation, like those who cultivate early
and, having not yet suffered loss, promptly correct themselves.

Repeatedly accumulating virtue,
one can overcome all obstacles.
Overcoming all obstacles,
one’s capacity knows no bounds.

Only **virtue** (*德*) can conquer things,
so when one’s personal virtue is fully realized,
its measure and extent are boundless.

Boundless virtue can establish a state.
A state founded upon such virtue can endure.

The people’s attachment to virtue
is like a child’s longing for its mother.

Indeed, the foundation of a state lies in the self,
and if the self possesses its Dao,
then it can endure forever.
If one takes the self as the state,
then the mother is the root of **yin** (*雌*), and
the nature of life and death,
though subject to birth and death,
cannot be altered—
hence the saying, *"endure forever."*

This is called the **Dao of deep-rooted stability and long-lasting vision** (*长生久视之道*).
**Gǔi** (*柢*)—pronounced *Dīng Jì* (*丁计*)—
*Yù Zhù* (*御注*) says:
*"With heaven and earth as its constant, it can achieve long life;
with the sun and moon sharing its radiance, it can endure forever."*

*Wén Dìng* (*文定*) says:
*"Using **frugality** (*jǐn*) to govern the people, one can establish a state;
using **frugality** (*jǐn*) to serve heaven, one attains deep-rooted stability."*

The sages of antiquity preserved their nature and destiny,
not expending their inner essence on external affairs,
thus their roots were deep and their foundations firm—
unassailable by force.
Though long life and enduring vision were possible,
they were not the ultimate aim.

In governing humanity and serving heaven,
though there are distinctions between inner and outer,
nothing surpasses **frugality** (*jǐn*).

*Chéng Yī Chuān* (*程伊川*) says:
*"The method of cultivation that prolongs one’s years,
the method of governance that invokes heaven’s blessing for a state’s longevity,
and the way common folk ascend to sagehood—
all these are the same.
When one reaches this point,
these effects naturally follow."*

**Chapter 59** – *Hé Shàng* names it **Abiding by the Dao** (*Shǒu Dào*).
This passage clarifies the use of **frugality** (*jǐn*).
Governing the people brings prolonged state fortune,
serving heaven brings enduring life.

To govern a great state,
it is like boiling a small fish—
**boiling** (*烹*), pronounced *Pú Gēng* (*普庚*), means *cooking*.
**Fish** (*鲜*), pronounced *Xiān* (*仙*), refers to *fish*.
This means it cannot be overdone.

Those who rule under the Dao
have no need for supernatural ghosts.
Not that their ghosts are not supernatural,
but that their supernatural power does not harm people.
Not that their supernatural power does not harm people,
but that the sage does not harm the people.

Thus, the two do not harm each other,
and **virtue** (*德*) flows back in harmony.

**Abiding** (*莅*), pronounced *Lì Zhì* (*力至*), means *to preside over*.
All responses to stimuli originate from within—
thus the sage practices non-action,
and the people find contentment in their natural state.
Externally, they seek nothing;
internally, they fear nothing.
Then **yin** and **yang** (*阴阳*) harmonize,
and all things find their proper order.
Hence, ghosts too have no need to exert their supernatural influence.

It is not that their ghosts lack supernatural power,
but that their supernatural power does not harm people—
because the sage does not harm the people.
Thus, ghosts and spirits all respond to his **virtue** (*德*) and transformation.
The two sides harmonize and delight in each other,
and all virtues converge—
this is the governance of **ultimate virtue** (*至德*).

*Liè Zǐ* (*列子*)’s discussion of sage governance
extends even to the point where *"all things lack blemish or disease,
and ghosts lack any supernatural resonance"*—
this is the same meaning.

*Wén Gōng* (*文公*) says:
*"If the kingly Dao is cultivated and made clear,
then these unrighteous **qi** (*氣*) will all be consumed and refined."*

**Chapter 60** – *Hé Shàng* names it **Abiding in Position** (*Jū Wèi*).
This passage clarifies that using the Dao leads to **virtue** (*德*) returning in harmony.

A great state is the **lowest flow** (*下流*) of the world.
Like the great rivers and seas,
which must lie beneath all other streams.

*Wén Dìng* (*文定*) says:
*"The world’s convergence upon a great state*
*is like all waters flowing downward."*

The world’s **intercourse** (*交*) is the world’s **yin** (*牝*).
**Yin** (*牝*), pronounced *Pí Rěn* (*婢忍*), is the *female* or *mother* of livestock;
**yang** (*牡*), pronounced *Mǒu* (*某*), is the *male* or *father* of livestock.
**Yin** (*静*) always conquers **yang** (*牡*) through stillness,
and stillness is the lowest.

Thus, when a great state abides below a small state,
it takes the small state;
when a small state abides below a great state,
it takes the great state.
Hence, sometimes it abides below to take,
sometimes it abides below and is taken.

**Abiding below** (*下*)—when referring to a great state taking a small state—
is pronounced *Xiá* (*暇*), meaning *from above to below*.
**Abiding below** (*下*)—when referring to a small state being taken by a great state—
is pronounced as in the character, with an ascending tone,
as it originates from the lower.

**Intercourse** (*交*) means *interaction and convergence*.
**Yin** (*牝*) embodies the **virtue** (*德*) of *stillness, gentleness, and yielding*.
**Yang** (*牡*) embodies the attributes of *vigorousness, strength, and elevation*.
Stillness can contain movement,
gentleness can overcome strength—
this applies to all things.
Thus, stillness and yielding are the constant way of victory,
and this is why they are the world’s convergence—
the meaning of *abiding in yin* (*守雌*) as the world’s *stream* (*溪*).

**Taking** (*以取*) means that a great state,
through its ability to abide below,
ultimately takes the small state and encompasses it.

**Taking** (*而取者*) means that when a small state abides below,
it will be cherished and received by the great state.
In the end, the people of the great state will even take pleasure in returning to it—
as when King Wen of Zhou excelled in honoring the aged,
and the people of Shao came flocking to him.

**Ye Mengde** said:
*"Taking"* means to obtain what one desires.

**Huang** said:
When a great state abides below toward a small state, it is like Tang serving Ge.
When a small state abides below toward a great state, it is like Goujian serving Wu.
The great state seeks only to encompass and nurture others,
while the small state seeks only to serve and submit.
Both achieve what they desire,
so the great should take the lead in abiding below.
Their reason for abiding below is merely to nurture and serve others.
It is not a calculated move for gain,
so if both fulfill their natural inclinations,
the great should be able to abide below,
allowing the small to return of its own accord.

After the *Great* (*大有*) in the *Yijing*,
it must be followed by *humility* (*谦*)—
for this is how one preserves the great.

This chapter elucidates how, through virtue, one abides below,
and how people converge and return in response.

**Qingyuanzi** said:
The body is the model of a state.
When the body is empty, all things come;
when the heart is without, harmonious *qi* returns.
This is what is meant by *abiding in yin* (*守雌*) and *embracing oneness* (*抱一*)—
that is, *yang* descending to refine *yin*,
transforming into pure *yang*,
the subtlety of *wuwei*.

This is another meaning.

**Dao** is the essence of all things.
*奥* (*Ào*), pronounced *yú-dào* (於到切).
The *Shuowen Jiezi* says:
*"The southwest corner of a hall"*—
deep and secluded, like the inner sanctum.
Truly, the Dao is vast and undivided,
its greatness without bounds,
all things contained within it and sustained by it.
Its smallness without limits,
yet all things are also within it, unseen.
Thus, the *Xisheng Jing* says:
*"The Dao is profound and mysterious,
an abyss of emptiness and nothingness.*
The treasure of the virtuous,
the refuge of the unvirtuous.
Though a person may be unvirtuous,
they cannot escape relying on the Dao for life—
thus, it is their refuge."

**Wen Gong** said:
The virtuous guard and use it,
while the unvirtuous also depend on the Dao for security.
Fine words can be traded,
and noble conduct can be bestowed upon others.
How could one abandon those who are unvirtuous?
*行* (*xíng*), pronounced *qù-shēng* (去声).
Truly, all people possess this nature;
even the lowest fool cannot lack the Dao-heart.
How distant is the Dao from people?
Thus, the most beautiful words are known to all,
and the most noble conduct is within everyone’s reach.
If someone, having committed wrong in the morning,
hears the great Dao in the evening,
they will abandon their falsehood and return to their true nature—
even if one tries to point out their wrongdoing,
it cannot be found.
How could they be abandoned?
Only salvation is needed—
this is the refuge of the unvirtuous.

Thus, establishing the Son of Heaven and the Three Ministers,
even with a *hongbi* jade and four-horse chariot as tribute,
is not as precious as sitting and offering the Dao.
*先* (*xiān*), pronounced *shì-xiàn* (悉荐切).
*Hongbi* (*拱璧*)—a jade of perfect curvature, the finest of gems.
*Si* (*驷马*)—four horses harnessed to a single carriage.
In ancient tribute rituals, when presenting a four-horse carriage,
one would lead with a *hongbi* jade.
Though the Son of Heaven and the Three Ministers are noble by power,
and *hongbi* and four-horse carriages are noble by material wealth,
they are not as noble as calmly offering the Dao.
The Dao is inherently possessed by all—
this is true nobility.
Yet the Three Ministers and *hongbi* are granted by fate,
not something one can casually attain.
People should strive for what is inherently theirs,
and what comes from outside is of little worth.

Why did the ancients value the Dao so highly?
Was it not because *"seeking leads to obtaining"*—
that even crimes can be pardoned?

This is why the Dao is the most noble under heaven.

**Question:** What is the meaning of valuing the Dao so highly?
It is because one does not seek externally but finds it within—
thus, seeking brings benefit to obtaining.
He who is resolute in the Dao will have no evil.
Only by not relying on external means to attain it
does one rise above calamity and fortune,
and how could misfortune reach them?
This is why the Dao is the most noble under heaven.

Some say:
*"Seeking leads to obtaining"*—the treasure of the virtuous;
*"Crimes can be pardoned"*—the refuge of the unvirtuous.

This is Chapter 62: *The Most Noble Under Heaven*.
**He Shang** names it *Dao*.

This chapter speaks of the Dao as:
*Wuwei* (*为无为*), *wu shi* (*事无事*), *wu wei* (*味无味*).
Great and small, many and few—
repaying resentment with virtue.

To engage with form brings great and small,
to be bound by numbers brings many and few.
The distinctions of great and small,
the divisions of many and few—
this is how resentment arises.
Only the Dao, beyond form and number, unites with the sage.
*Wuwei* emerges from *wuwei*,
*wu shi* from *wu shi*,
and *wu wei* from *wu wei*—
thus, it contains the boundless *Taipe* within the square inch,
unburdened by the slightest private desire,
gathering all things in the One Truth,
unmoved by high or low, external conditions.
Thus, each thing returns to its own nature,
each matter to its own course,
and great and small, many and few—
viewed as one, hatred and love vanish,
sage and commoner alike are undone,
and what resentment remains to be repaid?
Only virtue can contain it.

Moreover, if one’s intentions are extinguished,
it is like the heavens and earth covering and nurturing all without distinction.
Yet this is what common people find most difficult.
Only through earnest questioning and contemplation,
gradually cultivating it,
can one attain this state.

The following text outlines the method of cultivation to reach perfection.

*"Difficulties arise from what is easy,
the great from what is small.*
The most difficult matters under heaven begin with ease,
the greatest matters under heaven begin with the minute.
The Dao exists in the intervals of rising, resting, eating, and breathing—
this is easy.
Yet when it reaches its fullness,
only the sage can attain it—
this is difficult."

When one’s thoughts and deliberations have not yet arisen,
and one is blankly void without trace—
this is minute indeed.

Yet when it fills and suffuses completely,
even heaven and earth cannot exhaust its measure—
this is great.

Thus, gradually cultivating without a single action left unguarded,
when virtue is perfected, one’s abilities align with the sage’s.

When it is subtle yet nothing is wasted by even a hair’s breadth,
and one attains fullness of the Dao’s essence,
then one’s capacity matches that of heaven and earth.

Only by being cautious at its beginning
and not neglecting its end,
can the difficult be accomplished,
and the great be fully realized.

If one speaks of resentment,
then human resentment also grows from the small to the great,
and as resentment deepens, forgetting becomes more difficult.
If one can, at its origin, illuminate and penetrate thoroughly,
then it will immediately cease in stillness.

Thus, the sage never considers anything great,
and so can perfect the great.

The scholar must steadfastly establish resolve with broad and unwavering purpose,
yet most cannot harbor a heart of "greatness" beforehand.
If one harbors such a heart,
then one will surely fall prey to arrogance and self-conceit,
which only obstructs the Dao—
thus failing to act in non-action (*wuwei*),
to manage non-affairs (*wushi*),
or to savor non-savor (*wuwèi*).

Only the sage can transcend self,
and so their heart remains ever small,
thus enabling them to perfect the great.

Light promises bring few trusts,
excessive ease invites many difficulties.
It is because of their crudeness and lack of refinement,
that their words lack resilience and their deeds fail to harmonize,
and a neglectful attitude toward ease takes root—
this is why they find the Dao so hard to attain.

Thus, the sage regards difficulty as difficulty,
and so ultimately faces no difficulty.

The sage is born knowing and acts naturally,
certainly not needing exhortation before attaining ability,
yet how could they neglect it?

For virtue and capacity are equal,
unifying small and great,
one and many,
without any deficiency—
without any difficulty,
for there is nothing beyond their reach.

This again exhorts the scholar:
never to have a moment’s neglect of what is easy,
then their resolve will be bold,
their adherence firm,
and their caution at the end like that at the beginning—
and so they too will face no difficulty.

**Chapter 63**
*Named "Enshǐ" by Heshang*
This chapter elucidates the sage’s complete attainment of the Dao.

Its ease is firm in practice,
its foresight is simple in planning,
its fragility is simple in nurturing,
its subtlety is simple in dispersing.

Act upon it while it is yet unseen,
order it while it is yet undisturbed.

**Chapter 64**
*Named "Shǒuwēi" by Heshang*
This chapter praises the sage’s learning of *wuwei*, warning against the faults of action and attachment.

**Fragility**—*ruì*, pronounced with the *ruǐ* rhyme—refers to the tender, easily broken state, meaning desires are not yet firm. **Dispersion**—*pàn*—is like ice melting. This too follows the meaning of the previous chapter: if preserved when it has not yet sprouted, it becomes one with nature, hence *"easy to hold, easy to plan."* If observed at the moment of first sprouting, it will not stray far before returning, hence *"easy to nurture, easy to disperse."* **"Unseen"** refers to the time of *wuwei* and *wuwei*—when there is no thought, no action. **"Undisturbed"** refers to the time when it is just beginning and has not yet sunk into disorder. To act and govern at this moment means success without effort.

Yet reason arises suddenly, and enlightenment dissipates suddenly, while practice does not achieve perfection all at once—only through gradual cultivation. Hence, the following text speaks of nurturing virtue.

A tree of embrace grows from the smallest sprout;
A nine-tiered tower begins with a clod of earth;
A thousand-*li* journey starts beneath one’s feet.
These are words of exhortation, saying:
One must establish resolve beyond things and act with reverence within them—knowing and acting, striving for substance and root, never neglecting the minute, never overlooking the humble. Cultivate with meticulous care, nurture with enduring patience, and thus even the small may become great, the low may rise high, and the distant may be reached.

Yet if even a thread of scheming for gain or calculating success enters first, it will only hinder the Dao. Hence, it is further elaborated:

Those who act will fail;
Those who cling will lose.
Thus, *wuwei* means no failure,
And *wuji* (non-attachment) means no loss.
The people’s undertakings often falter when nearly complete.
If one remains as cautious at the end as at the beginning, there will be no failed endeavors.

*Jǐ*—level tone—
For Heaven’s principles are subtle and profound; private intelligence has no part in them. Thus, those who exert intention act with *wei*, and those who relax even slightly fail. Only by guarding with spontaneity does true strength accumulate over time, and virtue naturally form.

Therefore, the sage desires what others do not desire,
And values not the hard-to-obtain treasures.
He learns what others do not learn,
Returning to the errors of the common people.
To aid the natural unfolding of all things
Without daring to act.

The Dao is without desire—
By "desire," it means seeking what is within oneself.
Not desiring external things as noble,
True learning is *wuwei*—
Not indulging in excessive knowledge as learning,
But only returning to the common people’s excesses of emotion and desire,
Restoring them to their origin.

This Dao was never sought externally,
Nor could the sage make it a model for others.
Moreover, all things have their own natural Dao.
The sage only follows the principles of nature and life to establish teaching,
Guiding them to balance without daring to artificially benefit or aid growth.

---

**Chapter 65**
*Named "Chúndé" by Heshang*
This chapter clarifies how using intelligence breeds delusion, demonstrating the rule of profound virtue’s great harmony. Was this Laozi’s foresight of inevitable worldly changes, or did he bear a heart of concern?

The rivers and seas become kings of the valleys
Because they excel in descending.
Thus, the sage who wishes to be above others
Speaks in a manner that descends;
Who wishes to lead others
Places himself behind them.

「Thus, when one is in the highest position yet others do not feel burdened,
When one is at the forefront yet others are not harmed,
The world finds joy in recommending and supporting him without growing weary,
For he does not contend, so none contend with him.

He excels in descending—both in speech and in action.
*下* rhymes with *暇*, *乐* rhymes with *洛*.
The *Yǔ Zhù* says: *"Lún Chūjiǔ"* states,
*"With noble descending upon lowly, great favor is won from the people."*
Indeed, it is by winning their hearts.

When one is in the highest position yet others do not feel burdened,
They revere him with trepidation;
When one is at the forefront yet others are not harmed,
Many benefit from him willingly.

If such is the case, there is no thought that does not submit,
Hence, he is never weary of the world’s support.
The sage adapts to the times, conforming to changes through the Dao,
Does he seek profit? It is merely the virtue of humility in action.

Descend in virtue, and one’s form ascends;
Retreat in virtue, and one’s form leads.
Yang Xióng said:
*"He who descends himself is exalted by others;
He who places himself behind is placed ahead by others."*
Thus, the world delights in recommending and supporting him without tiring,
This is the Dao’s virtue of non-contention.

---
**Chapter 66**
*Named "Fùjǐ" by Heshang*
This chapter elucidates the virtue of descending without contention.

The world all deems my Dao great,
Yet it appears unorthodox.
Only because it is great,
Does it seem unorthodox.
If it were orthodox for long,
How could it be considered great?

*音* rhymes with *扶*.
If it resembles something,
Then it is no different from that thing—
How could it be great?

Xītáng Zhèng Xiá said:
*"The Dao is vast while things are small.
Men’s ceaseless striving yet ultimately clinging to smallness—
This is their entanglement in things."*

*Yuán* refers to the utmost of virtue reaching greatness.
If one attains greatness yet does not recognize it as such,
Then he aligns with the Dao and does not conform to worldly norms,
Thus the world deems my Dao great yet unorthodox.

I possess three treasures—treasures to uphold.
First: **compassion** (*cí*),
Second: **frugality** (*jiǎn*),
Third: **not daring to lead the world**.

Compassion makes one courageous;
The virtuous must have courage.
Frugality makes one expansive;
To guard moderation while giving generously.
Not daring to lead the world,
Thus one attains enduring leadership.
*长* is pronounced with the rising tone.

By placing oneself behind, one’s form leads,
Hence, he ultimately becomes the leader of all things.

The *Gàn* text states:
*"When the *Shēn* dragon emerges, if it lacks a head, it is auspicious."*

These three treasures all differ from worldly norms,
Thus they are considered great.

If one abandons compassion and courage,
If one abandons frugality and expansiveness,
If one abandons retreat and leadership,
Then he dies.

To abandon one’s foundation for superficial gain,
This is how one falls into exhaustion.
Thus, those who are harsh and boastful,
Who love to advance themselves,
Are all doomed to perish.

Compassion—when wielded in battle, it conquers;
When used in defense, it secures.
When Heaven intends to rescue one,
It shields him with compassion.

Compassion is the means by which the Dao of life flows and thrives,
It is the function of the *biàn*—
Thus, it is the foremost of the three treasures.

To govern with compassion,
Things respond as if drawn to a beloved parent;
They would even die for him without hesitation—
Thus, in battle he conquers,
In defense he secures,
Hence it is said: *"The virtuous have no rival under Heaven."*

If someone falls short in any way,
Heaven will still rescue and shield him with compassion—
This is the Dao’s principle of reciprocity,
For Heaven’s nature loves to return,
Ever favoring the good.

Wén Jiǎn said:
*"To depart from unity and embrace division—
This is how the Dao rescues."*

---
**Chapter 67**
*Named "Sān Bǎo" by Heshang*
This chapter clarifies that the Dao’s essence is supreme,
Yet its practice relies on compassion.

The virtuous scholar does not resort to force,
He does not valorize strength.」

**Chapter 67**
*Named "Sān Bǎo" (Three Treasures) by Heshang*
This chapter declares that though the Dao’s essence is supreme,
Its practice rests upon compassion.

The virtuous warrior does not rage,
Nor fights unless compelled—
Such conflict does not spring from private desires.
The one who best conquers foes does not contend,
For it is only the heart that does not contend
Which can overcome the contending of others.
Those greedy for victory who strike first are certain to fail.
The adept at using others places himself beneath them.
When his virtue is humble and yielding,
Others gladly serve him—
For his sincerity evokes their willingness to labor.
This is called the virtue of non-contention,
This is called the power of using others,
This is called the ancient harmony with Heaven’s extreme.

Only through non-contention and yielding
Does one abandon cleverness and artifice,
Follow Heaven’s natural order,
And thus align with Heaven’s own virtue.

Master Wén Jiǎn said:
*"When virtue merges with Heaven,
It surpasses all since the birth of humanity."*

**Chapter 68**
*Named "Pèi Tiān" (Harmony with Heaven) by Heshang*
This chapter sets forth four virtues to illustrate the harmony with Heaven.

In wielding arms, there is a saying:
*"I dare not be the aggressor but only the defender,
I dare not advance an inch without retreating a foot."*

This is called:
*"Moving without movement,
Warding off without arms,
Resisting without enemies,
Grasping without weapons."*
*(行: Upper as in the character, lower pronounced as *hù jiàng* (户刚切).)*

Master Wén Dìng said:
*"To act is to be the aggressor (*主*),
To respond is to be the defender (*客*).
To advance is to harbor intent for contention,
To retreat is to lack such intent.
Only when one lacks intent for contention
Does wielding arms equal not wielding at all—
Thus it is hard to advance but easy to retreat.
Even amid war’s chaos,
If there is no movement to be made,
No arms to wield,
No enemies to resist,
No weapons to seize,
How could there ever be blame for wielding arms?"*

No greater calamity exists than underestimating the enemy—
Underestimating the enemy risks losing one’s treasure.
Thus, when armies clash in battle,
The compassionate prevail.

*(几: Level tone.
丧: Departing tone, meaning "lose."
抗: To raise/lift.)*

Master Wén Dìng said:
*"Since compassion is the treasure,
To underestimate the enemy is to lighten the fight,
To lighten the fight is to risk killing—
This is to lose what one holds dear.
When two armies raise their forces in conflict,
And I act only when compelled,
Then my heart is filled with pity for slaughter—
When pity is seen, Heaven and humanity aid me.
Though I might wish not to conquer,
It cannot be helped."*

**Chapter 69**
*Named "Xuànyòng" (Mysterious Application) by Heshang*
This chapter uses the metaphor of warfare to elucidate the Dao,
With the key resting in safeguarding compassion.

Some say:
*"If applied to the human body,
Then wicked thoughts are more numerous than enemy states,
And desires for gain surpass the sharpest blades—
Is this not also the case of few desires reaching the state of no desires,
Thus preserving one’s treasure?"*

My words are very easy to know,
Very easy to practice.
Yet none under Heaven can know them,
None can practice them.

Human nature is inherently fixed and shared—
Pointing this out to others,
It should seem as though there is nothing difficult to know or practice.
Yet Heaven’s principles are vast and undivided—
If one deviates by even a hair’s breadth,
The error grows vast as a thousand miles,
For it cannot be illuminated by calculation.
Thus, those who overthink exceed the mark,
While those who forget fall short—
Hence none can truly know it.

It cannot be reached by gradual steps—
Those who seek quick gains favor shortcuts,
While those lacking strength abandon half the path—
Hence none can truly practice it.

Words have their root,
Affairs have their master.
Words are the elucidation of the Dao,
Affairs are the manifestation of the Dao.
Teaching without words,
Acting without action—
Is this not the root and the master?

This is why the dull-witted and the obstructed
Cannot know or practice it.

Only because of their lack of knowing
Are they not known by me.

Master Wén Dìng said:
*"The ancient sages had no thoughts, no actions,
Yet there remained those who were vaguely unaware of their own existence.
This is beyond the reach of deliberation—
Thus none ever truly knew them."*

Few know me,
Hence my worth is great.

Master Wén Jiǎn said:
*"The Dao is vast,
Thus few understand it."*

Hence the sage wears coarse garments while treasuring jade.
*(The Commentary says:
*"The sage conceals himself in Heaven without boasting or startling others.")*

Qīngyuán Zǐ said:
*"To wear coarse garments is to blend with the common dust,
To treasure jade is to embrace the Dao and nurture virtue."*

Master Wén Jiǎn said:
*"Coarse garments are the necessities of daily life,
Shared by all the world.
Jade is the most precious of goods,
Unique to me alone.
Few know me—
This alone reveals the Dao’s summit.
Yet the sage does not flaunt his differences,
For even his most profound and unknowable mysteries
Are displayed in the mundane and shared,
So that all may grasp them.
This is what Confucius meant by:
*'I have no secrets from you.'*"*

**Chapter 70**
*Named "Zhī Nán" (Knowing Difficulty) by Heshang*
This chapter shows that the Dao is very easy to know and practice,
Yet overlooked, it becomes very difficult.

To know what one does not know—this is excellence;
To not know what one knows—this is illness.

Only true knowing
Unites with the Dao,
Thus it is not hindered by knowledge—
This is the virtue’s summit.

If one does not reach true knowing
Yet claims to know,
Then he destroys substance with words,
Drowns the mind in superficiality—
To force knowing is to fall ill,
This is the virtue’s disease.

Only because of illness
Does one avoid illness.
The sage’s non-illness
Comes from his illness of illness—
Thus he avoids illness.

Only because he knows illness for what it is
Does he not fall into it.

The sage is born knowing—
His illness is inherently nonexistent,
No need to diagnose his illness
Before attaining the state of non-illness.

To say *"illness of illness"*
Is to show the student the medicine of illness,
So that he diagnoses the sickness of forced knowing
And awakens to true knowing, dispelling his illness—
Then illness and medicine are both removed,
Abilities and objects vanish together,
And he begins to realize:
*"From the start, there was no illness at all."*
Thus he aligns with the sage.

「Only humans are shackled by the private confines of form and matter,
Drowned in the delusion of common illusions,
Fearful of life and death,
Dreading gain and loss.
Thus the myriad threats of all things assail them,
And they tremble all their lives.

There is such a great threat, yet they do not know it.
If they truly know it,
Life and death are equalized,
Gain and loss are balanced—
Boldly advancing, acting without hesitation,
Then this great threat shines clearly before them.

Do not narrow their dwelling,
Do not weary of their birth.
Only because one does not weary of it,
Is one able not to weary of it.

*"Narrow"* (狭) is pronounced *xu* (胡夹切), meaning confined.
*"Weary"* (厌) is pronounced *yàn* (於艳切), meaning to abandon.

*"Do not"* (无) should be rendered as *"must not"* (毋).

Their dwelling is the ground of their nature—
To dwell in the vastness of all things,
Then they align their substance with the Great Void.

Their birth is the gathering of *qi*—
Containing the utmost essence of the Great One,
Then they share their function with Creation.

Only the *curved scholars* (曲士) cannot be spoken to of the Dao.
If they do not drown in petty transformations,
And truly embody what is without,
Then they narrow their dwelling by clinging to the *"no"* and abandoning the *"yes"*,
And are obscured by the doctrine of annihilation,
Wearying of their birth.

Thus I teach them: *"Must not narrow, must not weary,"*
So that students may know:
Nature is the leader of *qi*,
And its greatness is boundless—
They must expand and fill it to preserve its fullness.
Birth is the abode of the Dao,
And its function is inexhaustible—
They must cherish and nurture it to achieve its purpose.

Then nurturing *qi* preserves life,
Exhausting nature reaches the vital principle,
And they do not generate a heart of weary attachment,
Thus embodying *"no non-force, no non-stubbornness,"*
And *"long life is not the fault of life, nor is life an obstacle."*

If this is so,
Then life and the Dao dwell together,
And the Dao has never truly abandoned humans.

Thus the sage knows himself without revealing himself,
Loves himself without esteeming himself,
Hence he discards the latter to take the former.

*"Revealing"* (见) is pronounced *xiàn* (贤遍切), meaning to display.
*"Discards"* (去) is pronounced with an ascending tone.

To know himself is to return to fearless self-reflection,
Not narrowing his dwelling.
To love himself is to cut off external desires,
Not wearying of his birth.

Only through self-knowing and self-loving
Does one dwell in security.

And by not revealing himself to boast of his abilities,
Not esteeming himself to belittle things,
He has no heart to know what is revealed,
Nor to forget what is loved.

Wen Ding said:
*"Even though one knows himself,
He must not reveal himself to others;
Even though one loves himself,
He must not esteem himself to dazzle others—
For fear that others will weary or covet."*

As long as this heart is not forgotten,
There will still be fear.
Fear departs only when the great threat arrives,
Thus he discards the self-revealing and self-esteeming,
And takes the self-knowing and self-loving.

Yet the sage’s movement and stillness are both in accordance with Heavenly Principle,
With no discarding or taking—
This is the teaching that opens the Dao and guides the common folk.

---
**Chapter 72** (河上名爱己)
Heavenly River names *"Love Oneself."*
This chapter dispels false delusions to preserve the true.

To be bold in daring is to kill,
To be bold in not daring is to live.
These two are either beneficial or harmful.
What Heaven detests, who knows its reason?

Thus the sage finds it difficult.
*"Detests"* (恶) is pronounced with a falling tone—
The strong and rigid are destined for death,
Boldness here leads to killing and harm.

The gentle and yielding are in accordance with life’s principle,
Boldness here leads to living and benefit.
This is an immutable law,
Yet sometimes it reverses its norm—
Hence, *"either beneficial or harmful."*

The strong and rigid are destined for death,
Truly what Heaven detests.
If they escape by chance and have not yet suffered their fate,
Who can know its reason?
Thus the sage finds it difficult.

Liezi said:
*"To meet Heaven’s intent,
To weigh benefit and harm—
It is better to let it be."*

This is indeed so.
Yet to exhaust its end and witness its full change,
There is never a moment without loss—
Hence the following passage elaborates upon it.

Wen Gong said:
*"The sage, regarding Heavenly Dao,
Dares not alter its words.*

The Dao of Heaven
Is victorious without contention,
Wen Gong said:
*"To let things follow their natural course,
And things cannot defy it."*

It responds without words,
Heaven speaks of what?
The seasons proceed in their order—
Its response to rewarding virtue and punishing licentiousness
Is indeed without error.

It comes without being summoned,
The divine’s approach is spontaneous—
There is no favor or aversion,
As summer departs and winter arrives—
How could it await a summons before coming?

It is tranquil yet ever-strategic.
Yu’s Commentary says:
*"Virtue and conduct are always easily known,
Yet the perilous is discerned through them."*

Heaven’s net is vast and encompassing,
Sparse yet never failing.

*"Fail"* (失) may also be written as *"leak"* (漏).
---
**Chapter 73** (河上名任为)
Heavenly River names *"Act in Accordance."*

This chapter instructs that one must be bold in the Dao,
Not bold in force.
It continues to clarify Heavenly Dao’s natural course,
And concludes with a warning of Heaven’s net’s inexhaustibility,
So that people may believe it without doubt.

The people commonly do not fear death,
How can one frighten them with death?

If one makes the people constantly fear death,
And treats them as if they were strange anomalies,
I would seize and execute them—
Who would dare?

Wen Ding said:
*"Governance is burdensome and punishments are severe,*
Then the people have no place to rest their hands and feet,
Thus they commonly do not fear death—
Even if one frightens them with death,
It is of no benefit."*

If the people are at ease with governance,
Then they always delight in life and fear death.
If there are deceitful or rebellious ones who disturb the group,
Then I would seize and execute them—
Who would dare not submit?

There are always those who hold the power of execution killing,
And those who take their place killing—
This is like substituting for the Master Carpenter.

To substitute for the Master Carpenter
Is to risk injuring one’s hands.

Wen Ding said:
*"Those who hold the power of execution are Heaven,
Are Principle.
In the world’s governance,
If deceitful or rebellious ones act freely,
Then they are abandoned by Heaven—
To kill them is for Heaven to kill,
Not for me."*

Otherwise, it is to substitute for those who hold the power of execution killing—
To substitute for the Master Carpenter is to injure one’s hands,
To substitute for those who hold the power of execution killing is to involve oneself in the act.

Sheng Yi川 said:
*"Those who have not yet attained virtue
And first engage in deeds and achievements—
Are akin to this."*

**Chapter 74: *Heshang* [Riverbank] on "Naming Deception"**
This chapter states that when the ruler does nothing, the people know how to exhort themselves.

Master Zhang of History said:
*"Things are not feared for lack of those who kill them—
All things, left unchecked, will inevitably decay until they perish,
and thus there are always those who execute judgment.
But if one usurps the role of executioner out of fear,
not only will it fail to deter things,
but it will also miss its mark entirely.
Therefore, to wield the power of life and death over the people,
driving the world to follow you—
this is surely not the way.

The people’s hunger stems from the heavy taxes of their rulers—
thus they hunger.
The people’s difficulty in being governed stems from the ruler’s interference—
thus they are hard to govern.
The *Yuzhu* [Official Commentary] says:
*'Heavy taxation leaves the people impoverished,
excessive governance breeds deceit and falsehoods.'

People grow reckless with death
because their rulers overvalue life—
thus they grow reckless with death.
The *Yuzhu* says:
*'When life is indulged too greatly,
greed for gain becomes relentless;
no depravity or extravagance is left undone.'

Wen Ding said:
*'When rulers prioritize their own desires over the people,
the people likewise vie to enrich their own lives—
even in death, they will not cease pursuing gain.
Only those who do not cling to life
are wiser than those who do.'*

Master Wen of the Tang said:
*'To set oneself apart is to preserve oneself.'*

---

**Chapter 75: *Heshang* on "Acquisitiveness as Diminishment"**
This chapter warns against the harm of interference,
for only by forgetting life can one preserve it.

Wang Bi’s commentary suggests this chapter may not be by Laozi.

*"The living are soft and weak,
the dead are rigid and strong.
Grass and trees, when living, are soft and brittle,
when dead, withered and dry.
Thus, rigidity and strength belong to death,
while softness and weakness belong to life.
Wen Ding said:
*'When the unobstructed *qi* flows within,
the body knows no rigidity or strength.
When the supreme Principle abides,
affairs bear no burden of rigidity or strength.'

Thus, strong armies do not conquer,
strong trees are felled.
Therefore, rigidity and strength belong below,
softness and weakness belong above.
*Gong* [共], as in the text, means ‘the people collectively fell it.’

Liezi said:
*'Strong armies perish, strong trees break.'
This is correct.

The refined essence of things always resides above,
while the coarse always settles below.
The refined must be soft,
the coarse must be strong—
this is the natural order.
Yet in the world, there has never been one who was rigid and strong
yet able to stand above others.
Zhuangzi said:
*'To display meekness and humility as a standard.'
This is so.

The Master of True Perfection said:
*'Those who excel at overcoming enemies do not contend—
for their intent is not in strength.'

When wood grows strong and large,
people will surely fell it together.
Arms achieve victory through softness and weakness,
trees endure through softness and weakness.
Thus, rigidity and strength belong below,
while softness and weakness belong above—
human nature is no different."*

---

**Chapter 76: *Heshang* on "Warn Against Strength"**
This chapter states that softness and weakness can preserve the unobstructed and harmonious *qi*.

*"The Way of Heaven—
is it not like drawing a bow?
The high are lowered, the low are raised,
the excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.
The Way of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient.
But the Way of man is otherwise—
they diminish the deficient to serve the excessive.
The Way of Heaven is impartial,
always aligning with the mean,
so fullness invites diminishment,
humility invites benefit—
this is the Way of Heaven.

Ye Mengde said:
*'The archer draws the bow before releasing—
this too is a gathering unto oneself
before bestowing upon things.
With evenness as the master and harmony as the constant,
it aligns with the Way of Heaven,
so its raising and lowering, its excess and deficiency—
none fail to meet their measure.
Its taking does not come from without,
for it arises naturally,
thus it is impartial and balanced.

But man is otherwise—
he does not seek within,
thus he always diminishes the deficient
to serve his own excess,
forcing the issue,
thus he is partial and unbalanced.

The *Kaiyuan* commentary cites:
*'Diminishing the upper to benefit the lower is benefit,
diminishing the lower to benefit the upper is diminishment'—
the meaning of the two *gua* [trigrams] is clear.

Who can diminish the excessive
and serve the deficient throughout the world?
Only the Dao."*

The Sage acts yet does not rely upon it,
completes the work yet does not dwell upon it.
Is this not because he does not wish to be seen as virtuous?

Only the one who follows the Dao can do what Heaven does,
yet does not rely upon his doing,
nor dwell upon his work.
If one acts yet relies upon it,
and dwells upon his work,
then the virtuous will be seen in the world.
When the virtuous are seen in the world,
it is because they serve their own excess.

---
*Chapter LXXVII* – *Heshang* names this *Tian Dao*.
This chapter clarifies that the Dao’s use is upright and impartial,
and only by observing Heaven’s Way can one know it.
The Sage aligns with it.

Nothing is softer or weaker than water,
yet nothing can overcome the firm and strong.
This is because nothing can replace it.
Since water’s nature is to be gentle and yielding,
it does not lose itself yet conquers all things.
The yielding overcomes the rigid,
the weak overcomes the strong—
all know this, yet none can practice it.
Observing water reveals its lesson,
for truth is near and principle is clear—
how difficult can it be to know?
Only those who do not deeply trust the Dao fail to act.

Thus the Sage says:
*"To bear the nation’s filth is to be its sovereign;
to bear the nation’s calamities is to be its king."*

*Wen Gong* says:
*"To contain filth and absorb impurities is to achieve greatness.
Upright speech seems contrary.*
Upright speech aligns with the Dao,
yet appears contrary to the common,
for it opposes the shallow wisdom of near-emotion,
and thus aligns with the supreme Dao’s rectitude."*

---
*Chapter LXXVIII* – *Heshang* names this *Ren Xin*.
This chapter speaks of yielding gentleness,
so all things turn to it.

To reconcile great grievances,
there must remain excess grievance—
how can this be called good?
Grievance arises from delusion;
awakening from delusion reveals truth—
where then is grievance?
Now, if one does not treat the root
yet seeks to reconcile the branches,
though outwardly reconciled,
internally it is not forgotten—
this is excess grievance,
how can it be called good?
If one penetrates to the root,
then true forgetting is serene and still.

Thus the Sage holds the left contract,
yet does not demand accountability from others.
Contracts have left and right,
to establish trust and end contention.
The Sage shares this nature with all people,
yet people, lost in delusion,
chase after contention and strife,
thus they are confused by great grievance
and forget their root,
unaware of their true nature’s non-delusion.
Therefore the Sage holds fast to this original uprightness,
though he does not seek enlightenment from others,
yet people are moved by his transformation.
When delusion is exhausted and grievance released,
all spontaneously attain clarity,
returning to their inherent goodness and alignment—
just as the right contract fits the left.
What need is there for demands?

The left contract is like the prior awakening of nature.
*Qingyuanzi* says:
*"In ancient times, they tied knots to govern,
and split wood to make contracts—
the ruler held the left, the subject the right.
When the contracts met, trust was established.
Thus, the virtuous held the contracts,
the unvirtuous held the pass-through.
The virtuous required no words to be trusted,
for they governed without action,
yet people transformed of their own accord—
just as holding the contract.
The pass-through means ‘to pass through’—
those without virtue desire all to pass through them,
thus they eagerly seek to reconcile grievances.
Heaven’s Way has no favorites,
yet it always aligns with the virtuous."*

*Qingyuanzi* says:
*"The contract’s impartiality is like this—
only the fitting attain it."*

*Huan* says:
*"Those who do good do not seek from others,
nor from Heaven—
they simply trust in its natural coming."*

---
*Chapter LXXIX* – *Heshang* names this *Ren Qi*.
This chapter clarifies that extinguishing delusion lies in restoring nature—
all are governed by non-action.

In small states with few people,
let the people have tenfold or hundredfold tools yet not use them.
With sparse population and simple duties,
the ruler has no need to prize the virtuous,
while the people each rest in their natural allotments of Heaven.
Even if there are village tools sufficient for ten, hundred, or thousandfold leadership,
they do not seek use in the world.
For when words prevail and desires are exhausted,
people grow self-sufficient and boastful in outward display,
thus this is held up to instruct the governance of antiquity,
and to encourage the study of inward cultivation.

Let the people hold death in reverence
and not wander far.
Nurturing nature without desire,
they settle in their land and do not migrate.
Though there are boats and carriages,
they have no use for them;
though there are armor and weapons,
they have no need to array them.

Let the people return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.
Without competition for profit, without contentious strife,
thus the return to knotted cords is sufficient.

They find their food sweet, their clothing fine,
their customs settled, their occupations joyous.
With inner sufficiency and no external longings,
they take delight in their own nature alone,
so that wherever they go, they find contentment within themselves.
Thus, even in barren and desolate places,
they deem them sweet, fine, settled, and joyous—
for their joy lies in the Dao, not in things.

Neighboring lands lie in view, yet the sounds of roosters and dogs reach one another,
while the people live out their lives and die without ever visiting one another.
*"望音亡"*—when the sight of music fades—
is akin to *"望冠盖"*—when the sight of official carriages fades.
This is so because of their lack of desire and want.

---
**Eighty Chapters of the Yellow River School (Heshang Bingli):**
This chapter clarifies that when one settles into one’s natural allotment,
there is nothing to aspire to or seek.

*"True words are not ornate; ornate words are not true."*
Truth aligns with reality and the Dao, so it need not be adorned;
ornamentation pleases others, so it may not be true.

*"The virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous."*
Master Wen defined it thus:
If virtue is the priority, there is no need for argument;
if argument is the priority, it may not be virtuous.

*"The wise are not erudite; they grasp the One through which all things pass—
what need have they of breadth?
The erudite do not know.
Those drowned in breadth may not know the Dao."*

*"The Sage accumulates nothing.
The more they give to others, the more they possess;
the more they share with others, the more they have."*

*"为"* (for), phonetically akin to *"伪"* (deceit), is assistance.
The Sage embodies unity in their very being—
the One itself stands unestablished, so what accumulation could there be?
They hold nothing in reserve, exchange nothing with the world,
serene and unadorned, without self-interest alone.

Thus, they extend their virtue to others without depletion,
and impart the Dao to others without exhaustion.

Master Cao remarked:
*"The Sage’s body is empty yet responds with perfect aptitude."*

The Dao of Heaven benefits without harming;
The Dao of the Sage acts without contention.

「Wén Dìng remarked: *"If power can benefit others, then it can also harm them.
If strength suffices to act, then it suffices to contend.
Yet able to benefit and harm without ever harming,
able to act and contend without ever contending—
this is how the Sage follows the Dao of Heaven,
and thus surpasses all others to become the progenitor of all things."*

**This concludes the 81st chapter.**
The *Hé Shàng* [河上] Master expounds upon the essence of *Dào Dé* [Dao/Virtue], establishing *kě Dào kě míng* [可道可名]—that which can be spoken and named—as the fundamental principle of teaching.
Next, he distinguishes *shàng Dé xià Dé* [上德下德]—superior and inferior virtue—and describes the varying simplicity and refinement according to the times.

This chapter conveys trust in beauty to illuminate the spoken teachings,
discusses skillful argumentation to caution practitioners,
explains the understanding of breadth to show the distinction between confusion and enlightenment,
and expounds on the principle of *wú jī* [无积]—non-accumulation—to instruct those who would abandon excess.
It borrows the concept of *yǒu duō* [有多]—abundance—to elucidate the nature of the Law.
Finally, it unites the Dao of Heaven to discuss the Sage.

To lead scholars to grasp the profound subtleties within reason,
and to forget the means and symbols beyond the words—
thus, one may comprehend the teachings and yet forget them,
and attain the end.

This is the grand intent of the annotator.»

The *Liù Yáo* [六爻] [of the *Yì Jīng* [易经, *Classic of Changes*]] weighs heavily yet the entirety of the *Dà Yì* [大易] is subtle,
the *Sān Chuàn* [三传] [Commentaries] are crafted yet the initial intent of the *Chūn Qiū* [春秋] is obscured.
The *Hé Shàng* Master divides the chapters and defines the sentences,
while the *Lǎo Zǐ* [老子] blends the unified Dao into a scattered whole.

The Dao is beyond words,
yet the Sage seeks to awaken people’s understanding,
to make them know that Heaven and Earth’s vast completeness
is wordless and unattainable.
This text is the grand path to attaining the Dao;
scholars who follow it shall naturally find their return.

When the *Hé Shàng* Master and others interweave their interpretations,
their annotations become chaotic,
and some may begin to lament the lost sheep and divergent paths.

The *Guī Shān* [圭山] collection’s annotations—
are they not meant to illuminate the murky way within the obscured?
Those who cling to the *Yóu Rén* [涂人]’s [lost traveler’s] perspective
and question the *Gù Lú* [故庐] [old dwelling]—
by this path, they may directly grasp the *Lǎo Zǐ*’s unified essence.

I praise their earnest dedication and correct articulation,
and thus commend this single annotation.

In ancient times, Confucius had no fixed teacher,
so figures like *Cháng Hóng* [苌弘], *Shī Xiāng* [师襄], *Lǎo Cōng* [老聪], and *Zhèng Zǐ* [郑子] all sought his counsel.
Yet observing his words,
only *Nán Gōng Jìng Shū* [南宫敬叔] inquired about the origins of rites and music,
and the essence of *Dào Dé* [Dao/Virtue], from *Lǎo Dān* [老聃].
Could *Lǎo Dān* truly be compared to those below *Cháng Hóng*?
The criticism of *Yuán Rǎng* [原壤] stemmed from his study of *Lǎo Zǐ* [老子] falling short of the Master’s Dao—
this was not a disparagement.

Though Confucius grounded his teachings in tangible reality,
and *Lǎo Zǐ* [老子] sought the Dao in emptiness—
Confucius held that *Tài Jí* [太极], *Liǎng Yí* [两仪], *Sì Xiàng* [四象], and *Bā Guà* [八卦] were the foundation of all life,
while *Lǎo Zǐ* [老子] declared:
*"The Dao gives birth to One, One gives birth to Two, Two gives birth to Three, Three gives birth to all things"*—
their numbers differ as well.

Confucius wished people to know
that the Dao encompasses all things, is present everywhere, and never ceases;
*Lǎo Zǐ* [老子] wished people to seek
the Dao in the beginning of Heaven, Earth, and all things.
The Dao is singular,
yet its manifestations vary with each person’s focus.
The numbers are singular,
yet their applications differ with each person’s use.

Their differences cannot be forced into uniformity.

Yet in embracing simplicity and preserving purity,
in cultivating few desires and minimal self-interest to govern the heart,
in nurturing the spirit and holding to the One,
in extending gently and maintaining continuity to govern the body,
in treating substance as the root of lightness,
in treating stillness as the root of action,
in not boasting, not claiming credit, and not contending to respond to things,
in acting without action and desiring without desire,
in removing excess and moderation to govern the state and the world—
even the Sage cannot defy these principles.

Thus, *"the mysterious female, the progenitor of the valley"* [谷神玄牝],
*Chéng Zǐ* [程子] adopted it;
the teachings on *"nurturing qi"* [养气],
*Zhū Zǐ* [朱子] adopted them.
How could our school dismiss them lightly?
The *Guī Shān* [圭山] *Dòng Dàoshì* [董道士]’s annotations of *Lǎo Zǐ*’s *Dào Dé Jīng* [道德经]
gather the merits of all ancient and modern interpretations,
to elucidate and clarify the fundamental intent.
Even those who attach themselves to *Lǎo Zǐ*’s teachings for the sake of cultivation
shall find distinction in their origins and sequence.
Their labor is profound and greatly aids the Master’s teachings;
readers must not overlook them.
