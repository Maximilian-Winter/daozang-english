**Preface to the *Commentary on the Chapters and Sentences of the Dao De Jing*:**

The **Supreme Venerable Lord Lao** (太上老君) possesses the **Dao** (道) of vast profundity and the **virtue/power** (德) of boundless magnitude. He upholds simplicity while bestowing generosity, conceals the great and applies it where it seems useless, and embodies boundless action within the realm of **non-action** (无为). He transcends the **Ultimate** (太极) yet is not of antiquity, and extends beyond the **Three Realms** (三极) yet is not of the present age.

Those who grasp its lofty brilliance are called **Heaven** (天), those who grasp its vast depth are called **Earth** (地). The sun and moon receive it to alternate their luminous roles, the four seasons receive it to regulate their courses, and the mountains and rivers receive it to sustain their flowing and steadfast forms.

The **great** (洪) and the **subtle** (纤), the **high** (高) and the **low** (下), the **soaring** (飞) and the **concealed** (潜), the **active** (动) and the **rooted** (植)—each attains a portion of this **Dao** (道) and thus becomes the myriad things. Among these things, the most **responsive** (灵) is **humanity** (人).

Though I cannot fathom its full scope beyond its established boundaries, nor comprehend its intricacies beyond its given forms, I compel myself to name it the **Dao**. Without the **Sage** (圣人), this **Dao** would not exist; without the **Classic** (经), this **Dao** would not be transmitted. Hence, the **Dao** is difficult to hear, yet through the **Classic** it may be heard; the **Dao** is difficult to see, yet through the **Classic** it may be seen.

Those who recite this **Classic**, if they gain even a thread of insight into **non-action** (无为), may thereby **cultivate their own person** (修身), **harmonize their families** (齐家), **settle the people** (安民), and **bring the world to great peace** (措天下於太平). Yet even this is but its **coarse** (粗) application.

The *Nanhua Jing* (南华经) states: *"Its dust and dross, its husks and chaff, are still sufficient to mold the worthies Yao and Shun."* Is this not true?

As for the **essential roots of nature** (性根) and the **foundations of life** (命蒂), their **interwoven** (交摄) and **mutually fused** (互融) essence—where **wondrous manifestation** (妙有) meets **true emptiness** (真空), and **subtle speech** (微言) reveals **profound meaning** (显说).

The lofty words in layered profundity are like solitary peaks and sheer cliffs;
The supreme taste in serene simplicity is like prime wine and grand broths.
Its clarity is like flowers in a mirror’s reflection;
Its depth is like the moon in water’s embrace.

It may be grasped in silent accord, yet not comprehended through speech;
It may be met with divine intuition, yet not pursued through outward traces.
Unless one possesses a singular vision and meets Laozi in the boundless void,
It is difficult to even hint at its slightest essence.

My ancestor, the True Lord of Rectified Unity,
Twice receiving divine guidance,
Descended to the Western Shu,
Personally transmitting the ultimate Dao,
Unveiling the intent beyond the Five Thousand Words—
No residue remains.

Our lineage has guarded it for countless centuries,
Passed down through generations like dust,
Faithfully preserving the sacred teachings of the Most High Laozi,
As the foremost vow of our sect.

Thus, at every triennial assembly where scriptures are transmitted and blessings bestowed,
This Classic is expounded upon,
So that those in the hall and seekers of the Way may drink deeply,
Each fulfilling their measure.

Yet even if one instructs ten thousand miles of people daily,
The time would still be insufficient.

To be a disciple of Laozi yet not know his Dao
Is like eating full daily yet not recognizing the grains,
Or holding a candle all night yet not knowing fire.

Not only does one fail oneself,
But does one not deeply betray the Sage’s reverence for scripture?

Out of this recklessness, I have expounded its meaning,
Setting forth its chapters and phrases.

I do not dare claim to have grasped Laozi’s intent,
Yet if my disciples and those who honor virtue and delight in the Dao
May ponder it and gain insight,
Then the Elixir of Immortality need not be sought elsewhere—
The ultimate Dao is inherently ours.
When merit is complete and practice fulfilled,
The Dharmakāya remains unbroken—
This is an inner certainty.

Those who understand its meaning a thousand years hence
Shall find it as commonplace as dawn and dusk.

Oh, my fellow seekers—
Should we not strive with vigor?

「至治壬戌夏五月，嗣汉三十九代天师太玄子张嗣成再拜稽首谨序。」
In the summer fifth month of the *Zhìzhì* era (1309 CE), the 39th Heavenly Master of the Han succession, **Lord Taixuan Zhang Sicheng**, prostrates himself twice in reverence and respectfully composes this preface.

「**道德真经章句训颂卷上 嗣汉三十九代天师太玄子张嗣成训颂 道可道章第一**」
**Commentary on the *Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*, Volume One: The 39th Heavenly Master of the Han succession, Lord Taixuan Zhang Sicheng’s Explanation**
**Chapter One: *The Dao That Can Be Spoken***

The Dao that can be spoken is not the Eternal Dao;
The Name that can be named is not the Eternal Name.

*The Void* is named the beginning of Heaven and Earth;
*The One* is named the mother of all things.

Ever seek the Void with unwavering desire to behold its subtlety;
Ever seek the One with unwavering desire to behold its manifestation.

These two—though of one origin, yet bearing different names—
Are both called the *Mysterious*.

The *Mysterious* again the *Mysterious*—
The gateway through which all subtleties arise.

How shall I constrain the Dao with rigid labels?
Speak of it clearly, yet it is not so.

The interplay of *Void* and *One* in their creative transformations—
Only through probing *principle* and *qi* is the true mechanism revealed.

Ah! Those who have not yet awakened to the fact that it is neither *Void* nor *One*,
Yet cling to the notion of the Eternal Dao and the Eternal Name—
From such delusion, they conceive themselves, yet fail to grasp the formless essence.

What is the Dao?
It is *principle* and *qi*.

The *principle* that arises from the *Void* is called *li*;
The *qi* that manifests in the *One* is called *qi* itself.
With this *principle*, the Dao is named;
With this *qi*, the Dao takes form.

The *principle* abides in the *Void* yet is divine,
Thus it is natural and the essence of *xìng*.
The *qi* abides in the *One* yet is empty,
Thus it is natural and the source of *mìng*.

Heaven and Earth, all things—none can defy it.

Compare it to a *tǔlǐng*—
Its construction must follow its path.
Thus, where there is *principle*, there must be *qi*;
Where there is *qi*, there must be form.

Form becomes Heaven and Earth, all things—
This is the *Dao that can be spoken*, the *Name that can be named*.

Yet the *principle* as *principle* and the *qi* as *qi*—
Can they not also be spoken of and named?

Thus, it is neither *Void* nor *One*,
Yet the *Void* and *One* cannot be easily grasped—
This is the Eternal Dao, the Eternal Name.

The beginning of Heaven and Earth, when spoken of as *principle*, is the *Void*;
The mother of all things, when spoken of as *qi*, is the *One*.

Ever seek the *Void* with unwavering desire, and one attains stillness—
Thus one beholds the *principle* before its manifestation.
Ever seek the *One* with unwavering desire, and one attains responsiveness—
Thus one beholds the *qi* in its unfolding.

Same origin, different names, the *Mysterious*—
All subtleties arise from the interplay of *principle* and *qi*,
With neither *Void* nor *One* to constrain them.

Terms like *subtlety*, *manifestation*, and *gateway*—
Are but guides to lead the student onward in cultivation.

In this way, when one delves deeply,
All myriad things, though vast in number,
Are never separate from *principle* and *qi*, from *xìng* and *mìng*.

---

「**天下皆知章第二**」
**Chapter Two: *All Under Heaven Know***

All under Heaven know beauty as beauty—
Then ugliness arises.
All know goodness as goodness—
Then what is not good arises.

Thus, the *Void* and *One* give rise to each other,
Hard and soft complete one another,
Long and short define one another,
High and low balance one another,
Sounds and voices harmonize one another,
Front and back follow one another.

Therefore, the Sage acts in affairs of *wuwei*,
Practices the teaching of *non-speech*.

All things arise yet he does not claim them,
They are born yet he does not possess them,
He acts yet does not rely upon it,
When the task is done, he does not dwell upon it.

Only because he does not dwell upon it—
Thus it does not depart from him.

Even slight deviations from the *One* harm the great harmony,
Yet no opposition exists—this is the realm of *emptiness*.

When spring arrives, all things awaken with intent—
Why seek elsewhere the function of creation?

Ah! Now all words are utterly exhausted—
How shall I name this for my disciples?

If I chance to speak with Yao and Shun of the *ascendant peace*,
It is but a fleeting vision in dreams.

---

「**不尚贤章第三**」
**Chapter Three: *Not Valuing the Virtuous***

Not valuing the virtuous, the people do not contend;
Not prizing difficult-to-obtain wealth, the people do not steal;
Not displaying what is desirable, the hearts do not grow乱.

Thus, the Sage’s governance:
Empties the hearts, fills the bellies,
Weakens the will, strengthens the bones.

Ever makes them without knowledge and without desire,
So that even the knowing dare not act.

Acting in *wuwei*,
Then there is nothing that cannot be governed.

How does the Sage govern?
He simply extinguishes the impulse to create.

All people wander in their own *tian*—
What have I to do with myself?

Ah! When hungry, one eats; when weary, one sleeps—
All under Heaven, originally, has no single affair.

---

「**道冲章第四**」
**Chapter Four: *The Dao is Unbound***

The Dao is unbound yet used—
Sometimes it does not fill.
Deep as the abyss, it seems the source of all things.

It blunts the sharp, resolves the tangled,
Harmonizes the bright, aligns the dust—
Serene, it seems as though it might yet remain.

I do not know whose child it is,
Yet it precedes the Emperor.

The *Void* is unconstrained—
Where does it find obstruction?
All that is manifest, it contains within itself.

When things come, do not compete with them;
When affairs pass, the heart remains cool.

No place to flee from the bright moon,
The world vast and hazy.

Leisurely, one recognizes Me—
I am the *Emptied Sovereign*.

Ah! Laughable—these years gazing at shadows,
Now, even the *water mirror* is forgotten.

---

「**天地不仁章第五**」
**Chapter Five: *Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent***

Heaven and Earth are not benevolent,
Yet treat all things as *chúdòu*;

The Sage is not benevolent,
Yet treats all people as *chúdòu*.

Between Heaven and Earth—
Is it not like a *tǔlǐng*?

Empty yet unyielding,
Moving yet ever emerging.

Many words exhaust the meaning,
Better to guard the *Middle*.

All things employ and discard the *chúdòu*—
Used in sacrifice, then cast aside.
Yet this employing and discarding—
Is but the fitting of the times,
Not the Sage’s heart of preference or aversion.

Why should I burden My heart?

Compare it to a single breath—
It seeks the wind naturally.

At the juncture of the *Void* and *emptiness*,
How divine is the response of *qi*!

Do not weary in chewing the tongue—
I grasp this, My true essence.

Ah! When one forgets the mutual reliance,
Only then does benevolence reach its utmost,
Thus the Sage does not act as benevolent.

Because the Sage does not act as benevolent,
Thus he can be forgotten by all.

Where he passes, transformation occurs.
All words, myriad teachings—
Which are not mere illusions?

---
「**谷神不死章第六**」
**Chapter Six: *The Spirit of the Valley Does Not Die***

The spirit of the valley does not die,
This is called the *Mysterious Female*.

The *Mysterious Female*’s gateway,
This is called the root of Heaven and Earth.

Continuous yet ever present,
Used yet without depletion.

Strange and wondrous—*principle* and *qi* in their forms—
From *emptiness* to *reality*, they mutually generate.

Originally, Heaven and Earth are but one thing,
Endless responses—this is My essence.

Ah! This is the place of My birth,
This is the path to the *Daoyuan*.

The *Hidden Female* transforms into the *wooden rooster*,
Why labor to seal the clay pot?

「**谷言虚空章第六**」
**Chapter Six: *The Valley Speaks of Emptiness***

The valley speaks of emptiness,
For emptiness is the *principle* of the spirit.

The *Mysterious Female* holds the *principle* of life-giving,
The source from which *qi* arises.

Called the *Gate*,
It bears the meaning of opening and closing,
Where yin and yang are complete.

Because there is yin and yang, there are Heaven and Earth,
And all things take form accordingly.

Before their manifestation,
They originate from emptiness,
Thus their use is boundless.

---

「**天长地久章第七**」
**Chapter Seven: *Heaven and Earth Endure***

Heaven and Earth endure,
Because they do not generate themselves,
Thus they can endure eternally.

Therefore, the Sage places his body last,
Yet his body is first;
He abandons his body,
Yet his body is preserved.

Is this not because he has no selfishness?
Thus he fulfills his selfishness.

How can Heaven and Earth escape beginning and end,
Yet alone endure, surpassing the *Original Worker*?

To know *nature* and *command* is to prolong life for all—
Do not say the immortals are not impartial.

Ah! To know *nature* and preserve the spirit,
To know *command* and follow *qi*,
Without selfishness—this is the ultimate *principle*.

---

「**上善若水章第八**」
**Chapter Eight: *The Supreme Good is Like Water***

The supreme good is like water,
For water benefits all things without striving,
Dwelling where others scorn to be,
Thus it approaches the *Way*.

It rests in the lowly places,
Its heart is deep,
Its virtue is kind,
Its words are trustworthy,
Its governance is effective,
Its deeds are accomplished,
Its actions are timely.

Because it does not contend,
It incurs no blame.

Here, softness overcomes hardness—
The marvel of *nature*’s use is boundless.

The jade-green pool reflects my true face,
No need to gaze into the boundless sea.

Ah! When reaching the boundless sea,
Even greater clarity and tranquility arise,
All phenomena embraced in emptiness.

All under Heaven share its rain and dew,
A single pool of sweetness endures.

---

「**持而盈之章第九**」
**Chapter Nine: *Hold and Fill***

Hold and fill—
It is better to stop before fullness;
Shape and sharpen—
It cannot be long preserved.

Gold and jade fill the hall,
Yet none can guard them;
Rich and noble yet arrogant,
They invite their own ruin.

When the deed is done,
When the name is achieved,
Withdraw—this is the *Way* of Heaven.

Fullness tilts, rigidity breaks—
The four seasons cycle as they will.
Clear moon and cool wind are true enjoyment,
Only then do the sages inherit their legacy.

Ah! Heaven warns against excess,
Humanity values humility.
To attain harmony between Heaven and man,
No shame in the *Book of the Ramparts*.

---

「**载营魄章第第十**」
**Chapter Ten: *Nurturing Essence and Soul***

Nurturing essence and soul, embracing unity—
How could it ever depart?

Focusing *qi* to attain softness—
Could one be like an infant?

Purifying and gazing into the void—
Could one remain without blemish?

Loving the people, governing the state—
Could one act without doing?

Heaven’s gate opens and closes—
Could one remain without duality?

Clarity and openness in all directions—
Could one remain without knowing?

Nurturing yet not possessing,
Creating yet not relying,
Nourishing yet not controlling—
This is called *Mysterious Virtue*.

The Four Great Elements coalesce,
Entrusted to luminous clarity.

Preserve it with ease,
Unconcerned and unrestrained.

Within, what is there to see?
The world naturally settles.

The mechanism of entering and exiting—
Discerning motion and stillness.

While others are dazzled, I am as if blind.
Not claiming merit, not revering the sage.

Body and use are natural—
This is true *nature* and *command*.

Ah! True *nature* and *command* lie here,
Unfathomable, uncontradictable.

Soul and spirit merge to form a person,
Embracing unity—this is guarding *nature*.

What is meant by attaining softness, void-gazing,
Non-action, non-duality, non-knowing, non-possession, non-reliance, non-control—
All speak of the *Way* of embracing unity in accordance with *nature*.

---

「**三十辐章第十一**」
**Chapter Eleven: *Thirty Spokes***

Thirty spokes share one hub,
Yet it is the emptiness that gives the chariot its use;
Clay is shaped into vessels,
Yet it is the emptiness that gives them their function;
Doors and windows are carved for a room,
Yet it is the emptiness that gives it its purpose.

Thus, having is for utility,
Emptiness is for use.

The azure sky is vast and boundless,
All phenomena it contains without limit.

A mere clod of earth—
A well brings forth the spring.

Ah! Do not say two things are great,
For they exist within emptiness.

Where else could emptiness be placed?
Originally, it does not extend beyond oneself.

Emptiness is space—
The chariot’s space bears loads,
The vessel’s space holds contents,
The room’s space provides dwelling.

This speaks of the boundless use of Heaven and Earth’s emptiness,
Expanded to its utmost.

And it says it does not extend beyond oneself—
The heart, contracted to its essence.

---

「**五色章第十二**」
**Chapter Twelve: *The Five Colors***

The five colors blind the eyes,
The five tones deafen the ears,
The five flavors dull the palate,
Galloping and hunting drive the mind to madness,
Rare treasures lead to erratic conduct.

Thus, the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes,
And takes this while discarding that.

Form is a burden to me—
How much more so eyes, ears, and mouth?

A hollow heart and a full belly—
Thus one clarifies taking and discarding.

Ah! This is the path all must walk,
Concentrating essence, refining reality in practice.

When the belly is full and all is forgotten,
Inner and outer alike dissolve distinctions.

---

「**宠辱章第十三**」
**Chapter Thirteen: *Honor and Humiliation***

Honor and humiliation—like a startle,
Great calamity—like a personal injury.

What is meant by honor and humiliation?
Honor is exalted, humiliation is lowly;
Gaining it is like a startle, losing it is like a startle—
This is called honor and humiliation as a startle.

What is meant by great calamity as personal injury?
My great calamity arises because I have a body.
When I have no body, what calamity do I have?

Thus, to value the body for all under Heaven—
If one can entrust all under Heaven to the body;
To love the body for all under Heaven—
If one can commit all under Heaven to the body.

Honor precedes humiliation,
Wealth precedes great calamity.

Why be startled by it?
This body is also external.

This can be spoken of with those who know,
Thus one values and loves oneself.

All under Heaven is a single hut,
Entrustment may have its place.

Ah! This speaks of the calamity of having a body—
What benefit is all under Heaven to me?

If the body is forgotten, I am forgotten;
Xú Zhōng’s wind and bottle stir no emotion—
This is still not forgetting the body,
This is still not forgetting the body.

「To behold me as though I have abandoned myself—
How does this compare to the case of Nánguō Zǐ Qí?

**Chapter Fourteen: The Unseen Vision**
When seen, no form is named—this is called *yí* (平易, simplicity),
When heard, no sound is named—this is called *xī* (希微, subtlety),
When grasped, nothing is obtained—this is called *wēi* (微妙, elusiveness).
These three qualities,
Cannot be summoned or questioned,
Thus they merge into one.

Its upper reaches are not bright,
Its lower depths are not dim.
Boundless yet nameless,
It returns to the formless void.
This is called the *state* of the *stateless*,
The *symbol* of the *formless*—
This is called *hūhuǎng* (惚恍, vague and indistinct).

Approach it and you see not its head,
Follow it and you see not its tail.
Hold fast to the ancient Dao,
To govern the present with its essence.
To know the ancient origins—
This is called the * Dao Mémò* (道冒, the Dao’s beginning).

Not hearing is true hearing,
Not seeing is true seeing.
No need to grasp the firewood pitchfork,
No need to blow—it reveals itself naturally.

No beginning means no end,
Past and present are one thread,
From it arise myriad transformations,
Yet it remains the original face.

Ah! Recognizing the original face,
Lifting the *zhèngfǎ gāng* (正法鋼, the iron staff of correct teaching),
Clearly it is the *Xūhuáng* (虚皇, the Void Emperor),
Bowing to the Ten Directions in surrender.

**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Virtue of the True Gentleman**
The ancient virtue of the true gentleman—
Subtle, profound, and beyond comprehension,
Deeply unknowable.
Because it is unknowable,
He feigns its outward form:
Lighthearted yet cautious, as if crossing a river in winter,
Solemn yet wary, as if fearing his neighbors,
Dignified yet aloof, like a guest,
Dissolved yet clear, as if ice about to break,
Thick yet simple, like uncarved wood,
Vast yet hollow, like an empty valley,
Muddled yet pure, like turbid water.
Who can make turbid water still and gradually clear?
Who can settle the restless and make it move slowly, then flourish?
Those who preserve this Dao do not wish to be full.»

「For only by not being full can one avoid constant renewal.
It is because of what exists within,
That it manifests without.
Without and within—what does the heart contain?
Thus, nothing remains unsolved.
Only by being still and waiting,
Does one align with movement and response.
Ah, the unpossessed is truly possessed—
Thus it remains ever-present.
Ah, ever-present yet not present,
Not present yet unbroken,
Neither colored nor empty,
Neither strange nor monstrous.

**Chapter Sixteen: The Ancient Virtue of the Ultimate Void**
To attain the ultimate void,
And steadfastly guard stillness—
When all things arise together,
I observe their return to root.
Things teem and flourish,
Each returning to its origin.
Returning to origin is stillness,
Stillness is restoring vital breath.
Restoring vital breath is constancy,
Knowing constancy is clarity.
To not know constancy,
And act presumptuously—
Is perilous.
Knowing constancy is tolerance,
Tolerance is impartiality,
Impartiality is sovereignty,
Sovereignty is heaven,
Heaven is Dao,
Dao is enduring,
And one who abides in it faces no ruin.
It is said: "No obstruction, no wind passes through,
Leaves fall, the forest stands empty, year after year the same."
The void and stillness were once explained in ancient times,
Qi returns to the primal sea, life endless.
Ah, only the nature of qi is subtle,
And I alone know stillness.
If a person can remain perpetually clear and still,
All of heaven and earth shall return to him.

**Chapter Seventeen: The Supreme Sage**
The supreme sage—
The lowest knows of his existence;
The next, cherishes and praises him;
The next, fears and reviles him.
When trust is insufficient,
There will be distrust.
Ah, how precious is his silence!
When deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,
The people all say, "It was natural."
In times of harmony,
When frost and snow abound,
The people’s joy and fear follow the seasons.
Ah, who was it that struck the earth in song?
A thousand years have passed, yet his melody still resounds.
Ah, the qi of Yao, Shun, and Yu differed little in their splendor,
Rise and decline followed in turn—
Such is heaven and earth.

**Chapter Eighteen: The Decline of the Great Dao**
When the Great Dao is abandoned,
There arises benevolence and righteousness;
When wisdom and intelligence emerge,
There arises great deceit;
When the six relationships are discordant,
There arise filial and loving subjects;
When the state is in chaos,
There arise loyal ministers.
Without the Three Sovereigns,
Without the Five Emperors,
The Three Kings do not arise,
The Five Hegemons do not emerge.
No Blind Old Man nor King Tang of Shang,
Now is the time to observe heaven and earth’s beginning.
Ah, to observe beyond heaven and earth’s origin,
To perceive the wondrous before the beginning—
Only to find delight in wine’s essence,
And not trouble the sober with its transmission.

**Chapter Nineteen: Discarding the Sage and Abandoning Wisdom**
Discard the sage and abandon wisdom,
And the people benefit a hundredfold;
Discard benevolence and abandon righteousness,
And the people return to filial piety and love;
Discard cleverness and abandon profit,
And thieves and robbers vanish.
These three measures—
To use them as ornament is insufficient!
Thus, they must be relinquished.
Seeing undyed simplicity,
Embracing unrefined purity,
With few desires and little private gain.
The original chaos had no seven orifices,
Yet suddenly, eagerly, they were carved for it.
Who knows that within love, poison still breeds?
Poison kills vital qi, yet heaven remains unaware.
Ah, the two become one, the one is split,
The small obstructs the great.
Only when the heart has attachments,
Does it become its own harm.
Qi moves with singular purpose,
The primal is without opposition.
Retracting vision, returning hearing,
Focuses solely on what is within me.

**Chapter Twenty: Ceasing Learning Brings No Worry**」

The *Yes* and the *Ah*—how far apart are they?
The good and the evil—how far apart are they?

What people fear, one must not fail to fear.
Ah, its vastness knows no end!

The multitude bustles and rejoices,
As if feasting on the grandest sacrifice,
As if ascending the Spring Terrace.
Yet I alone stand still, unmarked by signs,
Like an infant yet to be weaned—
Contented and drifting, as if nowhere bound.

While others have abundance, I alone seem forsaken.
Ah, my foolish heart!
Pure and unadorned—
While the common folk are bright and clear,
I alone am dim and murky.
While the common folk are sharp and discerning,
I alone am dull and confused.

Serene as the sea, yet restless as if boundless—
While others have purpose, I alone seem crude and base.
I alone differ from others, yet depend on my mother for sustenance.

The Dao is forgotten in unity, undivided.
Like an infant, it only seeks the breast,
Lying content, drifting—what need has it of anything else?

When strength grows long, myriad disturbances arise;
Loss and gain within and without—
Thus, learning becomes a burden.

Only by ceasing learning am I free of burdens.
Ah, wondrous! Wondrous! Returning to the origin of heaven and earth.
Alas, to study is to lose the true—
The true is already lost, yet seeking it must be done within study.

Before others, speak not of dreams as truth—
Lest you deceive the foolish into graying in vain.

**Chapter Twenty-One: The Virtue of the Dao’s Form**
The Dao’s form follows only the Dao itself.
The Dao, as a thing, is only vague and indistinct.
Vague and indistinct—yet within it, there are forms;
Indistinct and vague—yet within it, there are things.
Deep and dark—yet within it, there is essence,
Its essence most true—yet within it, there is verity.
From ancient times to now, its name does not fade,
To observe the myriad things.

How do I know the myriad things are thus?
By this:
Only the void exists—
Only the void has spirit,
Only the spirit has *qi*,
Only the *qi* has essence.
Void and *qi* intermingle,
Substance without form—
Grasped in stillness, wondrous transformations flow ceaselessly.

Ah, the three treasures—spirit, *qi*, essence—
From nonexistence to existence, naturally formed.
All things in the world are thus—
Do not doubt the immortals’ true renown.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: The Fullness of Flexibility**
Bend, and you are whole;
Twist, and you are straight.
Hollow, and you are filled;
Worn, and you are renewed.
Few, and you gain;
Many, and you are confused.

Thus, the sage embraces unity as the model for all under heaven.
Not self-aware, hence clear;
Not self-righteous, hence illustrious;
Not self-praising, hence meritorious;
Not self-conceited, hence enduring.

Only by not contending does one avoid contention from others.
Was it not said that "bend and you are whole"?
Truly, fullness lies in sincerity.
Sincerity alone is whole—
Where sincerity reaches, nothing is otherwise.

The Confucian scholars—who claims they differ?
For a thousand years, they have only inquired about rites.
Ah, the Non-Ultimate and the Ultimate,
The Nameless and the Named—
Only sincerity and unity hold the true void.

Bend and you are whole, twist and you are straight,
Hollow and you are filled, worn and you are renewed,
Few and you gain, many and you are confused—
Naturally, they follow one another.

Darkly, the sun rises;
Clearly, the sun sets.
Subtract, and it increases;
Humility and honor shine forth.

This is where it returns—
Debate is like comparing millet to husks.

**Chapter Twenty-Three: The Simplicity of Few Words**
Few words, naturalness—
Thus, the gusting wind does not last a morning,
The sudden rain does not last a day.

Who does this?
Heaven and earth.
Even heaven and earth cannot endure long—
How much less so for humans?

Thus, those who follow the Dao:
Those who align with the Dao, the Dao delights in them;
Those who align with virtue, virtue delights in them;
Those who align with loss, loss delights in them.

Faith insufficient, there is doubt.
When words are natural, they are real—
Like heaven and earth in their constancy.
The unnatural is neither real nor enduring—
All return to one hidden principle.

Ah, neither speech nor silence—
Its pursuit is already exhausted.
Neither pretense nor change—
Gusting wind, sudden rain.
Thus, they are the same in their sameness—
Who differs in their difference?

Transformation! Ah, sincerity!
Nowhere it does not reach.
Speak only when the time is right,
And people will not weary of your words.

Words are not the Dao—
Words untimely are not trusted,
Not trusted, not sincere,
Not sincere, not constant.

Gusting wind, sudden rain—
The changes of heaven and earth.
Change cannot endure long—
Such is the natural order.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Unsteady Do Not Stand**
The limping do not stand,
The striding do not walk,
The self-aware are not enlightened,
The self-righteous are not illustrious,
The self-praising have no merit,
The self-conceited do not endure.

In the Dao, they are called "excess food, superfluous steps"—
Things may despise them, so those who follow the Dao do not dwell there.

Those who strive for height do not know their feet are raised,
Those who rush forward do not know their steps are wide.
Those who cling to possession do not transform,
Those who follow traces only prolong things.

Ah, the Dao diminishes again and again—
Without self, what more is there to seek?
The Tang and Yu had excess food,
Heaven and earth bore a superfluous mole.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Formless Unity**
There was a formless unity,
Born before heaven and earth.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Four**
Silent and boundless, it stands alone yet never alters,
Circumnavigates yet never falters.
It may be called the Mother of Heaven and Earth.

I know not its name, so I call it **Dao**,
And forcefully name it **Great**.

Great passes away,
Passing away grows distant,
Distant returns.

Thus, the Dao is Great,
Heaven is Great,
Earth is Great,
And the Sovereign is also Great.
Within the Four Great of the realm,
The Sovereign holds one.

Humans follow Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the Dao,
The Dao follows **Ziran** [自然, "So of Itself"].

The Dao has no fixed form—
Ah, its mystery in **Huncheng** [混成, "Formless Unity"]!

Within and without, Heaven and Earth,
Transform and give birth through transformations.

Seeking it, one cannot find—
Yet forcefully name it and it is named.

Who can reverse it?
The **ling** [灵, "spirit/soul"] of all things.

Ah, the **ling** of **Ziran** [自然]—
Do not grasp it with form!

Ah, to covet the peak of **Kunlun**,
Layer upon layer, building loftier halls.
Yet right before your eyes, **Kunlun** stands—
Pointing to others, can you truly see?

---

**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Weight as Root of Lightness**
The weight is the root of lightness,
The stillness is the lord of agitation.

Thus the Sage moves all day yet never strays from his baggage,
Though adorned with splendor, he dwells in serene detachment.

How can the ruler of ten thousand chariots
Lighten himself upon the world?

Lightness brings loss of ministers,
Agitation brings loss of subjects.

Ah, profound is the **Kunyuan** [坤元, "Earthly Origin"]—
Weight and stillness suffice.

Not to walk while walking,
Not to dwell while dwelling,
To govern the world—
This does not exceed following Earth.

Ah, when spring arrives, willow fluff drifts aloft,
Only the east wind they say holds sway.
Yet gone, it finds no resting place—
In vain do Heaven and Earth stretch vast!

---

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Virtue of Good Conduct**
Good conduct leaves no tracks,
Good speech has no flaws or blemishes,
Good calculation needs no reckoning or strategy,
Good closure has no doors or bolts yet cannot be opened,
Good binding has no cords or knots yet cannot be undone.

Thus the Sage is always good at saving others,
And so there are none he discards;
Always good at saving things,
And so there are none he casts aside.

This is called **Ximing** [袭明, "Emulating Clarity"].

Good people are teachers for the not-good,
Not-good people are resources for the good.
If one does not honor their teachers,
Does not cherish their resources,
Even if wise, they are greatly confused—
This is called the **key mystery**.

If there is no place to apply one’s strength,
Then there is no way to glimpse their openings;
If one applies their virtue,
Then there is a way to share their gains.

To take from all is to have no bias,
To boast of oneself is to be ensnared.

Ah, the **Yuanzao** [元造, "Original Maker"] does not cling to form,
What purpose does the Sage hold in mind?

Spring’s gentle warmth, flowers in bloom,
The sea’s embrace, waters deep.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing the Masculine**

Know its masculine, hold to its feminine,
And you become the **river** [溪] of the world.

To become the **river** of the world,
One’s constant virtue never strays—
Returning to the **baby-child** [婴儿].

Know its white, hold to its black,
And you become the **model** [式] of the world.

To become the **model** of the world,
One’s constant virtue never errs—
Returning to the **Wujie** [无极, "Formlessness"].

Know its glory, hold to its shame,
And you become the **valley** [谷] of the world.

To become the **valley** of the world,
One’s constant virtue is complete—
Returning to the **Pu** [朴, "Uncarved"].

The **Pu** scatters and becomes vessels,
The Sage uses it and becomes the **officials** [官长],
Thus great measures are never cut.

My body is wondrous like the baby-child,
Heaven and Earth are wondrous like the **Wujie** [无极],
The Dao’s essence is wondrous like the **Dapu** [大朴, "Great Uncarved"].

Observe its wonder,
And you know its **boundary** [徼, "limit"].

Firm yet yielding,
Bright yet not dazzling,
Noble yet humbly low—
This is to grasp its essence.

Ah, the **Dapu** scatters,
Heaven and Earth become vessels.

To grasp its essence,
To use Heaven and Earth.

The Dao originally has no form—
Forcefully calling it **Dapu** [大朴, "Great Uncarved"].

What is the **Dapu** [大朴] truly like?
When scattered and sought,
The beginning of Heaven and Earth, all things—
Yet still one sees its **unbegun wonder** [未始之妙],
Called the **Wujie** [无极].

When gathered and sought,
My body’s birth—
Still there remains the wonder of the yet-unborn,
Called the baby-child.

The baby-child is the wonder of form,
The **Wujie** [无极] is the wonder of no form.

Thus the wonder of the **Dapu** [大朴] lies between **having** and **non-having**,
Having yet non-having,
Non-having yet having—
This is how it becomes the Dao.

Humans are the **ling** [灵] of things,
To embody the Dao and know it—
To walk the Dao is to be bound by it.

To know the masculine and hold to the feminine,
To know the white and hold to the black,
To know the glory and hold to the shame—
To know and act upon this is the **Way** [方].

To never leave nor guard is to be complete,
All called **constant virtue**—
The Dao’s essence is the body,
Virtue is its application.

To know this is to hold **creation** in my palm.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Approach to Taking**

When one is about to take the world and do so,
I see it as unavoidable.

The world is a **divine vessel** [神器],
Unfit to be acted upon.

To act upon it is to ruin it,
To grasp it is to lose it.

All things either move or follow,
Either sigh or blow,
Either are strong or weak,
Either bear or collapse.

Thus the Sage avoids excess,
Avoids extravagance,
Avoids excessiveness.

To act without acting—
This is how one gathers what cannot be gained;
To have no mind yet mind—
This is how one governs what leaves no trace.

Even Heaven and Earth do not know my **crafting** [裁成],
Then who knows it as the **Emperor’s power** [帝力]?

Ah, to grasp the world’s movement,
To toy with things’ transformations—
All is **Ziran** [自然] and natural,
Wisdom and strength are all borrowed.

---

**Chapter Thirty: Assisting the Sovereign with the Dao**

To assist the Sovereign with the Dao—
Not to coerce the world with arms,
His undertakings are **revered** [好还, "returned with favor"].

Where the army encamps,
Briars and thorns arise.
After great armies,
Surely come years of calamity.

Thus the good one is **firm** [果] but not arrogant,
Firm yet not self-praising,
Firm yet not proud,
Firm yet not forced—
This is to be firm yet not coercive.

Things grow old when they are strong—
This is called **not-Dao**,
**Not-Dao** brings early ruin.

Great virtue is **life** [生],
To cease the sword is **martial** [武].

One moment’s wrongdoing
Harms the **qi** [炁] of Heaven and Earth.

Ah, to do good and receive a hundred blessings,
The **Great God** [上帝] descends upon you.

The **fine arms** [佳兵]—
A **disastrous** [不祥] instrument,
Things may loathe them,
Thus those who follow the Dao do not dwell there.

The **junzi** [君子] at home values the left,
In war values the right.

Arms are a **disastrous** instrument,
Not the tool of the **junzi** [君子],
Used only when there is no alternative,
To be **calm and simple** is the highest way.

---

To conquer yet not delight in victory—
Yet those who delight in victory,
These are those who take pleasure in killing.

Those who take pleasure in killing
Cannot fulfill their ambitions in the world.

Auspicious matters honor the left,
Inauspicious matters honor the right.

The Left General takes the left,
The Upper General takes the right—
This is to treat them as funeral rites.

Many killed, weep with sorrow and lament,
Victory in war is treated as funeral rites.

Prepared yet unused preserves the army intact,
Mobilized yet without battle is the highest victory,
To exchange positions is not what we revere,
To lament their deeds is to show profound warning.

Ah, the *Jinlu* [金箓] of Nine Truths thrice admonishes:
Compassion and mercy, no killing—this is the true talisman.

*O noble one*, do not speak of ennoblement,
For every triumph built on a field of bones.

---
**Chapter 32: The Dao Ever Nameless**

The Dao ever nameless,
Though crude and small,
The world dares not submit to it.

If lords and kings could guard it,
All things would come of their own accord.

Heaven and Earth unite,
Descending sweet dew—
No one commands it, yet all is balanced.

When first named, names were made.
Knowing when to stop,
Knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril.

The Dao in the world
Is like rivers and valleys to the sea.
Subtle yet honored—*li* [理],
Responsive yet certain—*qi* [炁],
Dispersed yet named—*form* [形],
Grasped yet unreturned—*instrument* [器].

Ah, emerging from the instrument,
Returning to the void,
Embracing the One from all things’ beginning.

---
**Chapter 33: Knowing Others is Wisdom**

Knowing others is wisdom,
Knowing oneself is enlightenment.
Overcoming others is strength,
Overcoming oneself is power.

Knowing contentment is wealth,
Persistent action is will.
Unshaken in one’s principles endures long,
Dying yet not perishing is longevity.

Self-knowledge and self-mastery hold deep virtue,
Sincere, firm, and pure—guard this center.

The nine orifices, the hundred bones—all illusory,
No past, no future—this is true emptiness.

Ah, clear in stillness,
At ease in constancy,
Thus one possesses one’s nature,
Not yielding to fate’s command.

---
**Chapter 34: The Great Dao Flows**

The Great Dao flows—
It cannot be confined to left or right.
All things rely on it to live, yet it does not claim.
When its work is done, it does not dwell upon it.
It clothes all things yet does not lord over them—
Thus it is ever without desire,
And may be called *small* indeed;
All things return to it yet it does not lord over them—
Thus it may be called *great* indeed.

Therefore, the sage never claims greatness,
And thus achieves true greatness.
Only because it is unattached,
No one can fathom its workings.
No one can fathom its workings,
Thus all things cannot defy it.
Only those who do not claim greatness for themselves can achieve it.

Ah, Heaven and Earth, ten thousand things—
Only form obstructs.
The great cannot be small,
The small cannot be great.

---
**Chapter 35: Grasping the Great Symbol**

Grasp the Great Symbol,
And the world will come.
Come yet cause no harm,
Peace and ease prevail.
Delight and bait—
Passing guests will stop.

The Dao spoken of—
Its taste is insipid.
Look upon it—insufficient to see,
Listen to it—insufficient to hear,
Use it—never exhausted.
Mysterious symbol without form,
Mysterious delight without sound,
Mysterious bait without taste,
Mysterious use without ability—
They return of their own accord,
They complete themselves of their own accord.

Ah, blowing the dragon flute,
Striking the *dù* drum.
The purple camel’s hump rises from the emerald pot,
Ten thousand ants, a thousand flies gather briefly.
How to cleanse the dust of three lifetimes?
I give you a cup of ever-flowing water.

---
**Chapter 36: When One Would Seize**

When one would seize it,
First must one firmly release it;
When one would weaken it,
First must one firmly strengthen it;
When one would destroy it,
First must one firmly establish it;
When one would take from it,
First must one firmly give to it.
This is called *subtle clarity*.

The soft overcomes the hard,
The weak overcomes the strong.
Fish cannot escape the depths,
The state’s sharpest tools
Must not be shown to others.
Opposites give rise to each other—
This is the inevitable *li* [理].
Fulfill our use,
And softness suffices.

Fish forget the depths,
People forget advantage.
Forgetting yet not forgetting—
This is how governance is achieved.

Ah, humans dwell between *li* and *qi*,
Like fish in water—
Unaware of their being,
Life and death in entering and exiting.
Follow it in accordance with *li*,
Guard it with softness of *qi*,
Treasure the utmost within,
Heaven and Earth in one beginning and end.

---
**Chapter 37: The Dao Ever Without Action**

The Dao ever without action yet without not acting,
If lords and kings could guard it,
All things would transform of their own accord.

When transformation stirs to act,
I shall restrain it with the nameless crude.
The nameless crude—
It too shall not desire.
Without desire, in stillness,
The world will self-correct.
Natural yet not forced—this is Heaven’s way,
Uniform yet not uniform—this is things’ nature.
Hold to its way,
Attain its nature,
And return to the formless form.
Silent, vast—
No scent, no sound—
Who then commands Heaven’s clarity and Earth’s peace?

Ah, observe water to know the Dao’s use of subtlety—
The waves stilled, yet wind may blow again.
No harm in standing quietly until it settles,
For then all will see its reflection.

It is said:
"Constant action yet without action,
To complete without dwelling, not to lord over, not to lead,
Softness, stillness,
Return, naturalness,
Diminish again, diminish—
All these stem from one fundamental meaning,
The way to seek the Dao."

The *Daodejing*’s five thousand words
Originally flow as one continuous meaning,
Master River-Up divided them into eighty-one chapters,
Yet its intent remains inherent.
Though some passages seem forced by analysis,
The reader, by seeking the whole through its divisions,
Shall naturally awaken to understanding.

---
*End of Commentary on the Chapters of the Daodejing, Volume One*
*End of Commentary on the Chapters of the Daodejing, Volume Two*

The succession of the Thirty-Ninth Heavenly Master, Great Mystic Sage Zhang Sici, *Commentary and Praise on the Chapter of Supreme Virtue Without Virtue*, Chapter Thirty-Eight:

Supreme virtue is without virtue—
Thus it has virtue.
Inferior virtue clings to virtue—
Thus it lacks virtue.
Supreme virtue acts without action,
Yet nothing is left undone.
Inferior virtue acts and yet leaves much undone.
Supreme benevolence acts without leaving anything undone,
Supreme righteousness acts and yet leaves much undone.
Supreme propriety acts, yet none respond—
Then it forces compliance with arms outstretched.
Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows;
When virtue is lost, benevolence follows;
When benevolence is lost, righteousness follows;
When righteousness is lost, propriety follows.
For propriety is the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,
Yet the first cause of chaos.
Premeditation is the adornment of the Dao,
Yet the beginning of folly.
Thus, the noble man dwells in substance, not in ornament,
In reality, not in pretense—
Hence he discards the latter and takes the former.

The Imperial Way bends, the Sovereign’s virtue declines,
Kings and tyrants mix, and benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom arise in succession,
A myriad words and thousand phrases—
Rhetoric triumphs over substance.
Yang seeks longevity, yin seeks transformation—
Clay and stone become elixirs, resembling oranges.
The Five Phases invert, primordial *qi* dissipates—
Alchemists swarm with mere techniques.
Alas! Since the world’s beginning,
All have been puppets of the past—
Though each generation grows more ingenious,
Each solution is worse than the last.

*Chapter on the Ancient Attainment of Oneness*, Chapter Thirty-Nine:

Those who attained Oneness in antiquity—
Heaven attained Oneness and thus was clear,
Earth attained Oneness and thus was tranquil,
The numinous attained Oneness and thus was responsive,
The valleys attained Oneness and thus were full,
All things attained Oneness and thus lived,
The lords and kings attained Oneness and thus ruled the world with integrity.
Yet if they lost that Oneness—
Heaven, without clarity, would fear to fracture,
Earth, without tranquility, would fear to erupt,
The numinous, without responsiveness, would fear to falter,
The valleys, without fullness, would fear to dry,
All things, without life, would fear to perish,
The lords and kings, without integrity, would fear to decline.
Thus, nobility finds its root in humility,
Exaltation finds its foundation in lowliness.
Hence, lords and kings call themselves "lonely, bereaved, and unworthy"—
Is this not their rooting in humility?
Is it not so?
Thus, the attainment of Oneness in numbers:
Though ten thousand chariots gather, there is no chariot.

The jade of old was not polished bright,
Nor chiseled sharp—rough as stone.
Heaven’s movement thrives through strength,
Earth’s bearing thrives through stillness.
The numinous shifts without fixed form,
The valleys empty to receive their fill.
All things in their diversity arise naturally,
Lords and kings govern through self-restraint.

Purity follows—
Duality brings discord.
Stone cannot be jade,
Jade cannot be stone,
Yet when stone may be jade and jade may be stone—
This is called *full virtue*.

Ah! Void and *qi* clash in wondrous strangeness,
Ten thousand forms, ten thousand shapes arise without end.
Each thing’s nature acts as it must—
Who knows the thread that binds them all?

**The Movement of the Dao’s Return (Chapter 40)**
The Dao’s return is movement,
The Dao’s use is softness.
All things arise from *having*,
*Having* arises from *non-being*.

Stillness governs motion,
Substance governs function.
*Having* and *non-being* cycle endlessly,
Like waking after a dream.

Ah! *Non-being* is spirit,
Spirit is nature,
Void is *qi*,
*Qi* is life.
Mutually they embody and function,
Motion and stillness—
Who escapes death and severs response?

**The Noble Hear the Dao (Chapter 41)**
The noble hear the Dao and diligently act upon it;
The mediocre hear the Dao and half-forget it;
The lowly hear the Dao and laugh—
If they do not laugh, it is not the Dao.

Thus the ancient said:
The bright Dao appears dim,
Advancing the Dao seems retreat,
The smooth Dao seems rough,
Highest virtue seems a valley,
Great whiteness seems shame,
Ample virtue seems lacking,
Established virtue seems stolen,
Sincerity seems perverse,
The greatest square has no corners,
The greatest vessel is fashioned late,
The greatest sound is near-silent,
The greatest form is shapeless,
The Dao is hidden, nameless.

Only the Dao
Lends itself and completes.
The wise see it and grow clearer,
The dim see it and grow dimmer—
People’s habits differ,
Yet the Dao’s essence and function are ever-present.

Not prizing one’s own worth,
Not claiming preeminence—
Only by yielding *having* to *non-being*
Can one generate the vastness of Heaven and Earth,
Surpass their enduring span.

Ah! The Dao is void and natural,
Yet faith and doubt alike fail to grasp it fully.
Do not follow the habits that divide people—
Better to forget before laughter comes.

**The Dao Generates Oneness (Chapter 42)**
The Dao generates Oneness,
Oneness generates Two,
Two generates Three,
Three generates all things.
All things bear *yin* and embrace *yang*,
Their *qi* mingles in harmony.
What men despise—
The lonely, bereaved, unworthy—
Are the titles of kings and lords.

Thus some things are benefited by loss,
Others by gain.
What men teach as right,
Is also my teaching.
The strong and violent
Do not meet a natural end.
I will make this my guiding principle.

*Tai Ji* by name,
Two *Yin-Yang* in form,
Three *Heaven-Earth-Man* complete.
Things move in their ranks—
Lowly in name,
Empty in fullness,
Thus preserving their life.

Ah! The numinous thrives through spirit,
Life through *qi*—
Empty and yielding,
One may match Heaven and Earth.

**The Softest in the World (Chapter 43)**
The softest in the world
Overcomes the hardest in the world.
Entering where there is no gap—
Thus the benefit of *wuwei* is great.
Teaching without words,
Benefiting without action—
Few in the world attain it.

Within Heaven and Earth, *qi* swirls and condenses,
Metals harden and dissolve.
No trace, no flaw—
Things arise and form without awareness.

Ah! The rope saw cuts wood,
Dripping water wears stone.
Silently know this—
Mystery aligns with nature.

**Which is Dearer: Name or Body? (Chapter 44)**
Which is dearer: name or body?
Which is more: body or wealth?
Which is more harmful: gain or loss?
Thus excessive love brings great expenditure,
Hoarding brings great loss.
Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace,
Knowing limits brings no peril—
Thus one may endure.

High renown brings slander,
Wealth invites theft—
Gain and loss cycle endlessly.
Only flesh and blood decay beyond repair.
Ah! The restless strive—
Why not turn inward?

Ah! The body itself is affliction,
What more could one seek outside?
Recognize the formless treasure—
Without the body, true freedom.

**Great Achievement Seems Deficient (Chapter 45)**
Great achievement seems incomplete,
Yet its use is unexhausted.
Great fullness seems empty,
Yet its use is boundless.
Great straightness seems bent,
Great skill seems clumsy,
Great eloquence seems tongue-tied.

Frenzy overcomes cold,
Stillness overcomes heat—
Calm and quiet are the norm for all things.
Heaven’s Way, Earth’s Way, Man’s Way—
All in their mystery rely on humility.
Cold and heat naturally alternate,
All things return to the void.

Ah! Heaven and Earth are formed,
Inner and outer—*qi*.
Great is its use—
Only emptiness suffices.

**When the Dao Prevails (Chapter 46)**
When the Dao prevails,
Warhorses plow the fields.
When the Dao fades,
Warhorses breed in the wilds.
No greater crime than craving desire,
No greater calamity than insatiability,
No greater fault than grasping.
Thus he who knows sufficiency is always sufficient.

Warhorses are worth less than dung,
Plow oxen sing as they till—
Clothing and food, each home provides.
Beware of greed and excess.

Ah! Desire’s first sprout
Grows from not knowing when to stop.
Unlucky to obtain—
Disaster lurks in fear.
The *Loulan* horse, a thousand li of bones,
The *Yuntai* edict—
Too late to lament.

**Not Leaving the Door (Chapter 47)**
Not leaving the door,
One knows the world.
Not peering through the window,
One sees the Dao.
The farther one goes,
The less one knows.

Thus the sage acts without going,
Sees without looking,
Achieves without doing.
Following footprints,
Straining the eyes—
Things turn endlessly without end.
At one moment’s stillness, clarity arises naturally,
Piercing to the marrow of all things.

Ah! Order and chaos, rise and fall,
Yin and yang’s shifts—
All gathered in the self,
None in contradiction.

Nurture *qi*, preserve spirit,
Cultivate spirit, nurture the True.
True realized, the Dao is one—
Eternal spring for ten thousand ages.

**Chapter 48: Daily Learning and the Dao**
Daily learning brings daily gain,
Daily Dao brings daily loss.
Loss upon loss,
Until one reaches *wuwei*—
*Wuwei* yet nothing remains undone.

Thus to take the world,
One must act with *wuwei*.
When action arises,
It is insufficient to take the world.

True learning flows naturally,
Asking nothing, debating nothing.
Loss without gain is futile—
Only gain can bring loss.
Cease not in loss,
And human desires will be exhausted.

All the world’s goods,
I take with joy.
Ah! Studying the Dao wearies the mind—already a demon’s work,
Studying immortality or *fa*—how much more so?
Who knows true learning is effortless?
When truly learned, affairs multiply.

**Chapter 49: The Sage’s Unchanging Heart**
The sage has no fixed heart,
Taking the people’s heart as his own.
The good, I approve;
The unvirtuous, I also approve—
Thus virtue is complete.
The trustworthy, I trust;
The untrustworthy, I also trust—
Thus trust is complete.

The sage moves among the world in simplicity,
Blending his heart with the people’s.
All gaze with their ears and eyes,
The sage treats them as children.

Not clinging to this,
The Dao follows;
Not dividing from that,
Virtue is contained.
The people, my kin;
All things, my companions—
Let their hearts return to innocence.

Ah! No distinctions among people and things,
Inclusive harmony, one accord.
All things generate and regenerate—
Truly, the vastness of Heaven and Earth.

**Chapter 50: Birth and Death**
Birth and death—
Thirteen perish in life,
Thirteen perish in death,
Thirteen perish in life’s motion toward death.
Why so?
Because of the excess of *shēngshēng* [vital proliferation].

「Thus it is said that those who skillfully cultivate life—
They walk upon land and do not meet rhinoceros or tiger,
They enter battle and are not harmed by armor or weapons.
The rhinoceros has no place to lodge its horn,
The tiger has no ground to set its claws,
Weapons have no room to hold their blades.
Why so?
Because there is no place where death may take them.
Birth and death are the natural order,
Not departing from the Dao’s measure—
Thirteen perish in life,
Thirteen perish in death,
And thirteen more perish in life’s motion toward death.
Exceeding in the pursuit of life,
One falls into death’s domain—
Thus three more perish, making six in death.
Life three, death six—
Together they form nine.
Neither life nor death—
Only one remains.
This one is the *kūn* [Receptive] root,
This one is the *qián* [Creative] origin—
Thus preserving my spirit,
Thus gathering my *qi*.
Spirit and *qi* void and empty,
One without division—
Things and self alike vanish,
What harm, what burden?

Ah! One and two rely upon each other yet never part,
Following life and death’s numbers, hard to defy.
Not seeking Heaven and Earth beyond my *qi*,
Who in dreams could know if dreams are real?
Heaven, Earth, and all things—
Within and without, none depart from *qi*.
*Qi* gathers and form arises,
*Qi* flows and life is sustained.
What is called nurturing life—
Is but following *qi*’s flow.

The Way of nurturing life—
If one indulges in excess, harming *qi* to bring death,
Then three more perish, making six in death.
Life three, death six—
Together they form nine.
Neither life nor death—
Only one remains.

Ah! This is the marvel of spirit and *qi* in void and emptiness,
Forgetting life and death,
Entering and exiting without hindrance—
What need have I of external things?

Understanding stillness,
Knowing its source and thus attaining stillness,
Not like counting breaths in rigid sitting,
Or dull stupor, mistaking it for emptiness.
If one sits dully in emptiness,
How could they observe *qi*’s flow to see Heaven and Earth?

Yet when *yang qi* is weak,
And *yin qi* is congested,
*Yin* ever thrives,
*Yang* ever suppressed—
Success is hard,
Failure is easy.
Days of clarity are few,
Days of obscurity are many—
Thus the fate of thirteen in life and six in death is manifest.

Not the root of right and wrong,
Yet all stem from human affairs.
The *qi* of Heaven and Earth,
In my body, not a moment ceases to flow.
Those who nurture life must be cautious in their movements.

**Chapter 51: The Dao Nourishes Life**
The Dao nourishes it,
Virtue cherishes it,
Things give it shape,
Circumstances perfect it.
Thus all things honor the Dao and revere virtue.
The Dao’s honor,
Virtue’s nobility—
None command them yet they act naturally.
Therefore the Dao nourishes, cherishes, lengthens, and matures it,
And sustains it with care.
It gives life yet does not possess it,
Acts yet does not rely on it,
Lengthens yet does not control it—
This is called *xián dé* [profound virtue].

Formless yet honored,
Emerging from all things—
This is the Dao.
Nameless yet noble,
Nurturing all beings—
This is virtue.
Thousands of forms, myriad states,
Great and small, diverse and layered—
These are things.
Past and present, bending and extending, growing and waning—
These are circumstances.
Honor its honor,
Revere its nobility—
It applies to all without exception,
It pervades all without obstruction,
Yet does not know its own source—
This is called supreme reason.

Ah! The Dao nourishes, virtue cherishes—
What wondrous purpose lies beyond trace?
Better yet, forget both honor and nobility,
Let them be clay tiles or gold—
It matters not.

**Chapter 52: The Origin of the World**
The world has an origin,
Which serves as the world’s mother.
Having obtained its mother,
One knows its child—
Having known its child,
One returns to guard its mother,
And thus perishes not in life.

Seal its *yuè* [Joy] orifice,
Close its gates—
A lifetime’s labor yields no fruit.
Open its *yuè* orifice,
Accomplish its work—
A lifetime’s labor brings no salvation.

Seeing the small is called wisdom,
Holding to the soft is called strength.
Using its radiance,
Then returning to its source—
No calamity befalls the body,
This is called *xí cháng* [following the constant].

Before Heaven and Earth,
Before parents—
The origin, not yet an origin,
This is called *yī yuán* [One Origin].
As father and mother,
Creation emerges from it—
Knowing emergence yet returning to origin,
Thus the spirit is preserved whole.

The spirit whole and unadulterated,
Wisdom and radiance in unity—
External thoughts do not intrude,
Internal speech does not issue forth—
Clearly perceived,
Blue sky, white sun—
No creation, no transformation,
What need have I of things?

Knowing the subtle and the manifest,
Knowing the soft and the hard,
Knowing action and concealment,
Knowing change and constancy—
The sage ascends to *Dǐng Hú* [Cauldron Lake],
The ruler governs as *Táo Tāng* [Emperor Yao].
Ah! Their dust and chaff—
Death yet no annihilation.

Ah! This is the first path to *Cháo Yuán* [Morning Origin],
The heart’s crown ascending to see the *Xū Huáng* [Void Emperor].
Flags of the *Dòu* [Big Dipper] constellation,
Sacrifices to the kitchen god—
All mere techniques.
Grasping tigers, seizing dragons—
Futile madness.»

The path of sudden enlightenment and direct attainment
differs from the fifty-ninth chapter’s gradual cultivation—
though their ultimate success is one and the same.

**Chapter 53: "Make Me Understand"**
Make me understand the Way,
and walk in its truth—
only reverence is needed.

The Way is vast and smooth,
yet people prefer shortcuts.
Morning halls grow empty,
fields lie overgrown,
granaries stand bare—
yet they adorn themselves in fine silks,
wear sharp blades at their sides,
gorge on delicacies,
hoard wealth in excess—
this is called thieving vanity,
not the Way.

To grasp affairs yet demand results,
to abandon the true and chase the crooked,
to govern the branches while neglecting the roots,
to fatten oneself while plundering one’s own—
all this is self-theft,
yet they know not to spare,
and still they boast.

Ah! Crossing seas, bridging rivers—
all labor in vain.
Pursuing flowers without fruit—
spring comes and goes in vain.

Do not boast of swift cleverness,
stealing my priceless treasure.

---

**Chapter 54: "The Unshaken Foundation"**
What is firmly established cannot be uprooted,
what is held close cannot slip away—
thus descendants offer sacrifices without ceasing.

Cultivate the self, and virtue becomes true;
cultivate the family, and virtue overflows;
cultivate the village, and virtue endures;
cultivate the nation, and virtue flourishes;
cultivate the world, and virtue is universal.

Thus observe the self to understand the self,
the family to understand the family,
the village to understand the village,
the nation to understand the nation,
the world to understand the world.

How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

Founding a dynasty is arduous,
preserving it is difficult.
Sacrifices at the ancestral halls—
for one age, for ten thousand ages.

Refine the self, harmonize the family—
the beginning of virtue’s effect.
Extend to village, nation, world—
simply carry it forward.

Cultivate the True, preserve the spirit,
cultivate the Dao, nourish the *qi*.
Small as serpent and fish,
great as heaven and earth—
all seen equally,
none outside this.

Ah! The hare is killed, the bird roasted—
no return to life.
Jewels buried deep in the sea—
no ripples arise.

How then to recognize the transcendent breakthrough?
Look where fish and dragons transform.

---

**Chapter 55: "The Depth of Embracing Virtue"**
The depth of embracing virtue
compares to the infant.
Poisonous creatures do not sting,
ferocious beasts do not seize,
grasping birds do not strike.

Bones weak, sinews soft, yet grip is firm;
unaware of male and female union, yet life arises—
the utmost of essence.
Crying all day, yet throat never hoarse—
the utmost of harmony.

Know harmony as constancy,
know constancy as clarity,
increase life as auspicious,
let the heart direct the *qi* as strength.

When things grow strong, they age—
this is called not the Way,
and not the Way brings early decay.

Five strokes of pure *yang*—
the *Buyan* child alone prevails.
Formless yet visible—what harm?
Ancestral essence deep and hidden—hold fast.

Harmony within essence—
no need to await union.
Constant and clear—
naturally one, never separate.

Mystery attains the logic of longevity,
fire and timing—do not force.

Ah! *Yang* virtue is *Buyan*,
five creations all of heaven.
*Yin* abides in two and four—
naturally so.

The infant’s use,
essence and *qi* complete—
no place of death,
what can harm?

*Yin* preserved yet unaffected,
*yang* robust and ever firm,
nature ungoverned—
how then ten thousand years?

This is the method to preserve the *yang* spirit.

From *Tian Yi* generating water to five creations forming earth,
the six strokes of pure *yang* usage—
then earth forms one *yin* shape.
Preserve it, yet do not employ externally.

Yet when combined, six is *yin*;
when analyzed, it is one *yang* number—
returning to beginning at the end.

Two and four—*yin* within *yang*,
used yet not employed.

Union means one *yin* below,
separation means two *yin* within—
thus deeply severed.

When essence and harmony reach their peak,
constant and clear—
all effects of pure *Buyan*, single use:
the divine light, one point,
self-illuminating from beginning to end,
penetrating to the finest hair,
transcending heaven and earth,
brightly enduring,
perceiving and knowing all.

---

**Chapter 56: "The Wise Do Not Speak"**
The wise do not speak;
those who speak are not wise.

Close the *Dui* [speech] orifice,
shut the gate,
dull the sharp,
resolve the tangled,
harmonize the light,
blend with dust—
this is called *Xuan Tong* [Mysterious Unity].

Cannot be approached yet not distanced,
cannot be used yet not harmed,
cannot be honored yet not debased—
thus it is the world’s most noble.

Zi Cha sits hidden,
Confucius feigns stupidity,
Kashyapa smiles subtly—
diverse paths, one destination.

No thought of others—
what difference in closeness?
No thought of gain or fear—
what use in harm?
No thought of shame or glory—
what bond in rank?

Silent insight, direct enlightenment—
rare and subtle,
this is true nobility,
the celestial lineage.

Ah! Withdrawing divine light, still as nonexistence,
while others drink their wine.
Only those who grasp the mystery know its wonder—
seize the divine dragon and ride it free.

---

**Chapter 57: "Governing with Rectitude"**
Govern with rectitude,
employ the unusual in war,
take the world with non-action.

How do I know this is so?
When the world abounds in taboos,
the people grow poorer.
When the people wield sharp tools,
the state grows corrupt.
When the people excel in craft,
strange things multiply.
When laws proliferate,
thieves and rebels arise.

Thus the sage says:
I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;
I love stillness, yet the people align themselves;
I act in non-action, yet the people grow rich;
I desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity.

Drape the robes and let the people transform—
this is governance by rectitude.
Dance the *Gan Yu* [ritual music] and the crops stand tall—
this is war’s unusual strategy.
Seize the world through non-action—
it lies in yielding and deference.
Rule the world through excess—
it lies in self-interest alone.

Ah! Ten thousand ages, ten thousand ten thousand ages—
ruler and people share one mechanism.
All desires become affairs,
stillness follows non-action.

Rectitude lost becomes punishment,
the unusual becomes deceit.

The Sage beyond Heaven and Earth,
observing the moon in midnight’s hour—

**Chapter Fifty-Eight: The Murky Governance**
When governance is murky, the people are pure;
When governance is scrutinizing, the people grow hollow.
Calamity, oh, leans upon fortune,
Fortune, oh, harbors calamity within.
Who knows their ultimate end?
Is there no rectitude or perversity?
Rectitude turns to the unusual,
Goodness twists into malevolence.
The people’s confusion—
its day has long since come.

Thus the sage is square yet does not cut,
sharp yet does not cleave,
straight yet does not overreach,
bright yet does not dazzle.
The people’s customs blend like muddy waters,
governance shifts between laxity and rigor,
calamity and fortune are not without cause—
human hearts are inherently uncertain.

Endless myriad transformations surge,
like dreams that cannot be grasped.
The perfected one embraces the primal *qi*,
nurturing the embryo’s foundation.
Holding the *you* within the *wu*,
wondrous use never falters.
Piercing the illusion beyond illusion,
this unity was never one.

Ah! Calamity and fortune—
none but oneself creates them.
See in the four limbs their prescience.
Refine human affairs with Heaven’s principle,
recognize sincerity’s impulse before motion.

**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Governing Human Affairs and Heaven**
To govern human affairs and align with Heaven,
nothing surpasses *jian* [frugality].
For *jian* is early return.
Early return is called accumulating virtue deeply,
deeply accumulated virtue conquers all.
Conquering all, its limits are unknown—
unknown limits ensure the realm’s endurance.
The mother of the realm,
enduring through longevity and clarity.

This is the Dao of deep roots and firm foundations,
long life and enduring vision.
Extending beyond oneself—
the method for governing others.
Drawing inward to guard the heart—
the principle for serving Heaven.
Following substance to attain emptiness,
not exhausting use is *jian*.
Thus returning to the origin,
thus accumulating virtue,
being able through inability,
reaching the extreme of the boundless.

Thus the ruler’s governance over people
and the mother’s service to Heaven
both attain their essence.
Once the mother is secured,
the child needs no seeking—
nature’s root and life’s foundation,
nurtured and planted firm.
Twining the two *qi* into thread,
transforming myriad things beyond measure,
gazing upon Heaven and Earth’s ultimate end,
soaring in the boundless domain.

Ah! This is the second method of *Chao Yuan*,
Blue Spruce not in the sea’s center.
The hidden female stirs no zephyr,
the embryo-shell divides the moon’s light.
Cultivating the True, learning the Dao—
enter as one, or if divergent,
discern motion and stillness’ mechanisms,
clarify response and correspondence’s logic,
guard with waiting—
naturally, naturally.
This is the accumulation of merit and conduct,
fulfilling the three thousand.

**Chapter Sixty: Governing Great States**
Govern a great state as you would cook a small fish—
with Dao rule the world, its spirits are not numinous.
Not that its spirits are not numinous,
but that they do not harm—
not that they do not harm,
but that the sage does not harm.
Thus both sides remain unharmed,
virtue returns in exchange.

As cooking a small fish—
one seeks the proper water and fire,
balancing yin and yang.
Its spirits are not numinous—
using yin’s softness to conceal the yang.
Its spirits do not harm—
yang is not unused, yet its rigidity is hidden.
The sage does not harm—
harmonizing and completing,
preserving the Great Harmony.

Ah! Sole yang cannot stand,
sole yin cannot generate.
Generating and completing all things,
yin and yang merge.
Using rigidity brings fracture,
enduring softness is strength.
Rigidity guards within,
softness acts without.
Following Heaven, conforming to Earth—
this is humanity’s brilliance.
Harmonizing and completing,
Heaven and Earth attain serenity.
Returning to the self,
all things are encompassed.
Showing withered death,
preserving my rigid clarity,
endlessly unwaning,
aspiring to the Supreme Clarity.

**Chapter Sixty-One: Great States as the Lowly**
Great states are the lowly flow,
the world’s confluence, the world’s female.
The female ever overcomes the male through stillness,
stillness is the lowly way.
Thus great states humble themselves to small states,
then take them;
small states humble themselves to great states,
then are taken.
Thus sometimes one humbles to take,
sometimes humbles and is taken.
Great states desire only to nurture others,
small states desire only to serve others.
Both gain what they desire,
so the great should naturally be lowly.
Serving the small with greatness is virtue.
Serving the great with smallness is wisdom.
The virtuous rejoice in Heaven and are universal,
the wise fear Heaven and are complete.
Universal, the world emulates its land;
complete, a state secures its Heaven.
Uniting great and small in mutual gain,
this is the natural result of humility.

Ah! Rivers surge ceaselessly—when will they rest?
The sea vast as Heaven, congealed and still.
Observe how motion stirs within stillness,
where yin and yang intertwine—soften the heart.

**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao as the Essence of All Things**
The Dao is the essence of all things,
the good person’s treasure,
the unvirtuous’ safeguard.
Fine words can be sold,
noble conduct can be bestowed upon others.
What use is discarding humanity’s flaws?
Thus establishing the Son of Heaven,
appointing the Three Ministers—
even with a jade tablet and four horses leading,
it is not as good as presenting this Dao.

Why did the ancients value this Dao?
Not for seeking to obtain,
not for escaping blame—
thus it is the world’s most precious.
That which hides all things in formlessness is called essence,
knowing its value and possessing it is called treasure,
borrowing it to live without knowing is called safeguard.
Thus when there is no goodness, its goodness appears;
when there is no beauty, its beauty appears;
when there is no honor, its honor appears—
all these arise interdependently for use.
Why debate what to keep or discard?
Elevate it with rank,
court it with rites—
only the worthy can wield such resources.
Why not seek it within oneself?
Restore all wonders in a single thought’s shift.

Ah! The Dao—how can it be spoken of?
How can it be done?
If the Three Ministers were to sit and debate it...

「九万里天同看月，妙哉善恶未分时。
*For the Way of Non-Action, Chapter 63*
To act without action,
to do without doing,
to savor without savoring—
great or small, much or little,
rewarding resentment with **virtue**,
attempting the difficult at its easy,
achieving the great at its small.

The world’s difficult tasks must begin with ease,
the world’s great undertakings must arise from the minute.
Thus the Sage never seeks to act greatly,
and so can accomplish the greatest deeds.

Light promises bring few fulfillments,
many trivialities invite many calamities.
Therefore the Sage regards what is difficult as difficult,
and so never faces true difficulty.

Having a mind is not the true mind,
clinging to forms is not the true form—
effortless and natural,
without resentment or **virtue**-seeking.

Attempt the difficult at its easy,
achieve the great at its small—
only **few** (fewness) and **pā** (subtraction/abnegation) matter,
grasp their essence, and you hold the key.

Four horses cannot overtake a spoken word,
a single promise must be weighed with utmost care.
Heed it, heed it—
only then can success be ensured.

Ah! When the sun rises, deeds spring forth;
when the tongue remains, flavors seek their match.
Greatness and smallness, difficulty and ease—
they flow and ebb in endless exchange.

Heaven and Earth have no fixed order—
who can say there is a day of *non-doing*?

Alas! I have lost myself—
what is true gain or loss?

*On Ease and Simplicity, Chapter 64*
Its ease is simple to uphold,
its unseen signs are simple to plan,
its fragility is simple to float away,
its subtlety is simple to disperse.

Act before it exists,
order before it is disordered.
A tree of ten arms begins from a tiny sprout;
a nine-tiered tower rises from piled earth;
a journey of a thousand *lǐ* begins beneath one’s feet.

The doer brings ruin,
the clinger loses hold.
The Sage acts without acting,
and so knows no ruin;
holds without clinging,
and so suffers no loss.

When the people undertake affairs,
they often falter just as completion nears.
If you guard the end as you guard the beginning,
there will be no ruined undertakings.

Thus the Sage desires without desiring,
does not prize hard-to-obtain goods;
learns without learning,
corrects the errors of the common people,
to assist the natural unfolding of all things—
and never dares to act.

Seeing the world’s *few* (precursors) and then acting,
to fulfill the world’s tasks;
knowing the world’s *wēi* (subtleties) and then acting,
to dissipate the world’s transformations.

There are gains and losses that can be weighed before the *few* (precursors),
and wisdom insufficient to reveal the *wēi* (subtleties).
Therefore, guard the end as you guard the beginning—
abandon this, take that—
so that you may assist the natural creation of all things
and follow the principles of **Dao/Way**.

Ah! Seek your cloak before the snow and frost arrive,
a woodworm can still bore through stone.
Act without scheming and still find fulfillment,
adding legs to a snake only brings misfortune.

*Ancient Masters Skilled in the Dao, Chapter 65*
The ancients skilled in the Dao
did not seek to enlighten the people,
but rather to befuddle them.

The people are difficult to govern,
because their cleverness is too great.
To govern with cleverness is to harm the state,
to govern without cleverness is the state’s blessing.

Knowing these two principles is the **kǎishì** (standard/criterion).
The one who can know the **kǎishì** (standard/criterion)
is said to possess **Xuándé** (Mysterious Virtue).

**Xuándé** (Mysterious Virtue) is profound and distant,
contrary to things—
only then does one reach the **great order**.

Cleverness flows like water,
foolishness nears the true.

Lend them their own harm,
and they will harm others.

The true returns to simplicity,
and the people transform with purity.

Thus, when the standard is taken,
the world returns to **rén** (benevolence).

Ah! Qin ruled with cleverness to fool the masses,
yet did not know the masses fooled Qin.
If you grasp the truth of foolishness,
ask Han Wen of old.

*Jiānghǎi as the Sovereign of All Valleys, Chapter 66*
Jiānghǎi (the sea) can be sovereign of all valleys,
because it excels in yielding to them,
and so becomes their master.

Thus the Sage, wishing to lead the people,
must speak in terms of yielding to them;
wishing to serve the people,
must place himself behind them.

Thus the Sage stands above yet the people do not feel burdened,
leads yet the people do not suffer harm,
and so the world gladly follows and does not weary.

Because he does not contend,
the world cannot contend with him.

No humility compares to the sea,
and all waters flow toward it;
no self-subtraction compares to the Sage,
and all the people return to him.

Waters flow toward it and so exhaust the earth’s advantages,
the people return to it and so harness the times of Heaven—
thus humility is the foundation of exaltation,
and self-subtraction is the root of enrichment.
These are all hidden in their *wu* (non-being),
who can know their purpose?

Ah! The Dao of **humble yet exalted, subtract yet enrich**—
observe the sea to understand the **creative principle**.

Look now at the Milky Way in the sky,
its tail has never known a reverse flow.

*The World Speaks of the Dao, Chapter 67*
The world speaks of my Dao as vast,
yet it seems unlike.

Only because it is vast does it seem unlike.
If it were like, it would have long been trivial.

I hold three treasures,
protecting and upholding them.
The first is **cí** (compassion),
the second is **jiǎn** (frugality),
the third is *not daring to lead the world*.

**Cí** (compassion) brings courage,
**jiǎn** (frugality) brings abundance,
not daring to lead the world
brings completion and longevity.

Now abandon **cí** for courage,
abandon **jiǎn** for abundance,
abandon humility for precedence—
death will follow.

**Cí** (compassion) in battle ensures victory,
**cí** (compassion) in defense ensures stability.
When Heaven would rescue someone,
it shields them with **cí** (compassion).

The Dao is vast without form—
if it takes form, it becomes small.

Only these three treasures can govern the world.
**Cí** (compassion) sustains life,
**jiǎn** (frugality) enriches the people,
not daring to lead
preserves enduring peace.

Only by guarding and remaining tranquil
can one achieve lasting completion.

Abundance aids mutual support,
courage drives righteousness—
abandon these to take others,
beware, lest death ensue.
Return to them, and you will attain eternal life.

The Dao has no favorites,
it rewards only the **good**.

Ah! These three treasures are shared by all—
having them depends on the person.

How else guard the **qi**?
How else conserve the **jīng** (essence)?
Disturbing and striving to lead,
how can one preserve one’s **shén** (spirit)?

**Shén** (spirit) preserved, **jīng** (essence) and **qi** harmonized—
enduring and tranquil, let no emotions stir.

Neither contend nor defend—
naturally, my true self is fulfilled.

*On the Virtuous Scholar, Chapter 68*
The virtuous scholar is not martial,
the skilled warrior does not rage,
the conqueror of enemies does not contend,
the master of people places himself beneath them.

Is called the **virtue of non-contention**,
Is called the **power of using people**,
Is called the **harmony with Heaven’s ancient extreme**.

The scholar who is not martial,
preserves his body thereby;
The warrior who does not rage,
calms his **qi** thereby;
The victor who does not contend,
preserves his full **power** thereby;
He who places himself beneath others,
finds his **virtue** and joy thereby.

Uniting with Heaven’s **virtue** to return to the same source—
This is the ultimate attainment of the ancients.

Ah! Preserving the body and calming the **qi** are both difficult,
And preserving full **power** while attaining **virtue** is even harder.
When water and fire harmonize, dragons and tigers submit,
Where human and Heaven meet is the **Golden Elixir**.

*On the Art of War, Chapter 69*
The art of war has this saying:
I dare not be the aggressor but only the guest,
I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.

This is called **action without action**,
This is called **having no enemy**,
This is called **pushing without arms**,
This is called **grasping without weapons**.

No greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—
Underestimating the enemy risks losing my **treasures**.

Thus, when armies clash,
the compassionate shall prevail.

To be the guest rather than the aggressor,
lies in **responding** with subtlety;
To retreat as a means of advancing,
lies in **holding firm within oneself**;
**Action without action**,
lies in **not disturbing the mind**;
**Having no enemy**,
lies in **yielding to the other**.

Humble and decisive to achieve **power**,
despising the petty while seizing the vital.
The angry destroy their own **virtue**,
the merciful grasp the principle of victory.

Ah! In eighty-one chapters on war,
knowing the subtlety of war brings **eternal life**.
Heaven and Earth, all things share the same **body**,
victory and defeat are originally but two sides of balance.

*My Words Are Easy to Know, Chapter 70*
My words are easy to know,
easy to practice.
Yet none in the world can know them,
none can practice them.

Words have their **root**,
affairs have their **master**.
Only the ignorant fail to recognize me.
Few know me,
and thus I am honored.

Therefore, the sage wears coarse robes while treasuring **jewel-like virtue**.

Easy to know, easy to practice—
these are my words.
None know, none practice—
this is called the **Dao**.

Only the **Dao** has a **root** and a **master**,
like a **jewel**, thus worthy of honor and treasure.

Ah! All myriad things are the **Dao**,
and the **Dao** flows—what does not follow it?
Each person carries a **jewel within**,
its wonder lies in **speechlessness and unawareness**.

*Knowing the Unknown, Chapter 71*
Knowing the **unknown**, this is supreme;

---

**Chapter 71**
*Knowing the Unknown*
Not knowing the **unknown** is a **flaw** [病].
Yet only those who recognize their **flaw** [病] do not suffer from it.
Thus the sage does not **flaw** [病],
because he recognizes his **flaw** [病],
and so does not **flaw** [病].

To know what one does not know is **self-effacement** [自谦];
to claim to know what one does not know is **self-delusion** [自昧].
If one can recognize **self-delusion** as a **flaw**,
then one knows **harm** [害] yet avoids it.

Only the **innately wise** [生知] is called the sage—
what **flaw** could there be?

If one does not know yet claims to cure the **flaws** of others,
is this not the reason he is called the **sage of sages** [圣圣] and the **fool of fools** [愚愚]?

Ah! Being yet not being,
having yet not having—
the Confucian **standard of conduct** [格言],
to claim attainment when none is gained,
to claim realization when none is verified—
the Buddhist **precepts and warnings** [戒示].
Combining these two to return to their source,
what need is there to distinguish between them?

**Chapter 72**
*The People Do Not Fear Authority*
The people do not fear **authority** [威],
then **great authority** [大威] arrives.

Do not narrow their dwellings,
do not satiate their desires.
Only because one does not satiate,
does one not satiate.

Thus the sage knows himself yet does not reveal himself,
loves himself yet does not exalt himself—
so he abandons that and takes this.

The ruler is **benevolent** [慈], the people are **affectionate** [爱].
If they are **affectionate**, they will not fear—
the **affection** of those who do not fear,
**great authority** [大威] resides in it.

**Tolerate** them like the **heavens** [天],
and their dwellings will be secure;
**nurture** them like the **earth** [地],
and their lives will be joyful.

Above and below are not satiated,
**responsive harmony** [感应] follows one principle—
knowing yet not revealing,
loving yet not exalting.

To **conceal** as **virtue** [能],
to **humble** as **beauty** [美],
abandoning that which is not the **Dao**,
taking only this **Dao**—
governing others, cultivating **true essence** [修真],
there is no place it does not reach.

Ah! Within the **just and yielding** [刚阳外顺],
the heart naturally expands,
the body naturally at ease.

Therein recognize **true knowledge** [真知] and **affection** [爱],
and believe in the **longevity scripture** [长年住世书].

**Chapter 73**
*Courage in Daring*
**Courage** in daring leads to **slaying** [杀];
**courage** in not daring leads to **life** [活].
These two—
one brings **benefit** [利], the other **harm** [害].
What the **Heavenly** [天] abhors,
who knows its reason?

Thus the sage finds it difficult.
The **Dao** of **Heaven** [天之道]:
**Virtue** prevails without **strife** [不争],
**Resonance** responds without **words** [不言],
**Summons** are answered without **calling** [不召],
**Simplicity** yet **virtue** is well-planned [善谋].

**Heaven’s net** is vast and wide,
**Sparse yet nothing escapes** [疏而不失].
**Venting one’s qi** [暴其气] is the **mechanism of death** [死之机];
**Upholding one’s resolve** [持其志] is the **principle of life** [生之理].

Why must these two—
one bringing **harm**, the other **benefit**—
be so inevitable?

Those who do not seek **Heaven’s** [天] changes are like that—
who then knows **Heaven’s** [天] constant principles?

Thus a **drip** can **pierce stone** [石穿],
**Silence** can **summon thunder** [雷厉],
**Cold and heat** follow **nature’s** [自然] course,
**Wisdom and calculation** [智虑] do not **stall** [滞].

**Boundless** yet encompassing all **myriad things** [万有],
without constraint—
though as small as a **thread of hair** [一毫],
none can escape it.

Ah! **Heaven’s** [天] **abhorrence** of excess and **slaying** [恶盈恶杀] is none other than the **Dao**;
**Entering death, entering life** [入死入生] are all **mechanisms** [机].
Seizing the **great outline** [大纲],
returning to **mastery** [掌握]—
let **constant and change** [常变] be as one’s will,
and none will transgress.

**Chapter 74**
*The People’s Common Fear of Death*
The people commonly do not fear **death** [死],
so how can one frighten them with it?

If one makes the people constantly fear **death**,
and yet does so **strangely** [奇],
I would seize and **slay** them—
who would dare?

There are always those **charged with slaying** [司杀] who **slay** [杀].
If one **charged with slaying** **slays** [代司杀者杀] instead,
this is called **substituting for the master carpenter** [代大匠斲].

If one **substitutes for the master carpenter** [代大匠斲],
rarely will one not harm one’s hands.

People do not yet know to **cherish life** [爱生],
so they act as if they do not fear **death** [死].
If one makes them **rejoice in life** [生以乐],
how could they not fear **death**?

Those **charged with slaying** [司杀] are none other than **Heaven** [天],
for **guilt** [罪] is **slain** [斯杀].
What is called **substituting for those charged with slaying** [代司杀],
is **slaying** with **private intent** [私意].
Like **substituting for the carpenter** [代匠斲],
harming one’s hands is inevitable.

Harming others harms oneself—
**Heaven’s Dao** has a **retributive principle** [还理].

Ah! To **arouse intent** [起心] is to **harm** [伤] already;
when one **harms** others, it **harms** oneself as well.
Even one’s **descendants** [子孙] cannot escape—
after a **single reflection** [一回念],
one returns to **benevolence** [仁].

**Chapter 75**
*The People’s Hunger*
The people’s **hunger** [饥],
is due to their rulers **taxing and consuming** [食税] too much—
thus they **hunger** [饥].
The people are **difficult to govern** [难治],
because their rulers **act** [有为]—
thus they are **difficult to govern** [难治].
The people **despise death** [轻死],
because their **pursuit of life** [求生] is excessive—
thus they **despise death** [轻死].

Only those who do not **pursue life** [无以生为],
are **worthy of life** [贤於贵生].
**Taxation and levies** [赋敛] are heavy,
**ten thousand households** [万腹] are empty;
**clever schemes and strategies** [智术] are employed,
**ten thousand breaths** [万息] are disturbed.

**Indulgent cravings** [嗜欲] are boundless,
yet I **bestow** them thickly—
**pursuing life** yet **entering death** [入死求生],
unknowing of **pain** [痛].

How better to **forget** both **cleverness** and **quietude** [清静]?
With **abundant food** [饱饭] and **mechanisms** [机],
the people **value life** [重].

Ah! The **life** of **indulgent cravings** [嗜欲之生],
is like the **day** suddenly **darkening** [昼忽暝].
**Ten thousand burdens** [万累] pile up,
**daily** competing with the **heart** [与心竞].
How to **remove** them?
By **simplifying** and **calming** [以省以定].
The **Dao** of **quietude** [清静之道],
is its **essential principle** [要领].

**Chapter 76**
*The Principle of Human Life*
Human **life** [生] is **soft and weak** [柔弱],
**death** is **hard and strong** [坚强].
All **myriad things** [万物] and **grasses and trees** [草木],
their **life** is **soft and brittle** [柔脆],
their **death** is **withered and decayed** [枯槁].
Thus **hard and strong** [坚强] are **death’s** [死] companions,
**soft and weak** [柔弱] are **life’s** [生] companions.

Therefore, **strong armies** [兵强] do not **conquer** [胜],
**strong trees** [木强] are **split** [共].
Thus **strength** and **greatness** [强大] are **low** [处下],
**softness** and **weakness** [柔弱] are **high** [处上].

**Soft and weak** [柔弱]—
**qi** tempered in **gentleness** [气之温和];
**hard and strong** [坚强]—
**qi** constrained in **severity** [气之肃杀].

**Gentleness** [温和] is the **void** [虚] of **yang** [阳],
**severity** [肃杀] is the **blockage** [塞] of **yin** [阴].
The **void** [虚] preserves **spirit and essence** [魂神],
the **blockage** [塞] restores **corporeal form** [体魄].

Who knows that **death** and **life** [死生] are not merely **companions** [徒],
but surpass **creation’s** [造化] unfathomable **mysteries** [不测]?

Ah! The **yin body** [阴体] is **soft and weak** [柔弱], yet employs **hardness and strength** [刚强];
the **yang body** [阳体] is **hard and strong** [刚强], yet employs **softness and weakness** [柔弱].
**Reversing the Five Phases** [五行颠倒] is but a **minor technique** [小技];
**life** and **death** of **myriad things** [万物死生],
are all under **mastery** [归掌握].

**Chapter 77**
*The Dao of Heaven*
The **Dao** of **Heaven** [天之道],
is it not like **drawing a bow** [张弓]?

The **high** are **lowered** [抑],
the **low** are **raised** [举],
the **excessive** are **reduced** [损],
the **deficient** are **supplemented** [补].
The **Dao** of **Heaven** [天之道]:
**Reduce** the excessive,
**supplement** the deficient.

The **Dao** of **humans** [人之道] is otherwise:
**Reduce** the deficient to **serve** the excessive.
Who can **serve the world** [奉天下] with the excessive?

Only those who follow the **Dao** [有道者].
Thus the sage **acts** [为] yet does not **rely upon** [恃],
**achieves** [功成] yet does not **reside in** [居].
His **not desiring** to be seen as **virtuous** [不欲见贤],
what is the **Dao** of **Heaven** like?

Using the **bow** as an **analogy** [譬诸],
when it is **fully drawn** [既张],
it will soon **relax** [不久必弛].
The **high** must be **lowered** [必抑],
the **low** must be **raised** [必举],
the **excessive** must be **reduced** [必损],
the **deficient** must be **supplemented** [必补].

Using the bow as an analogy, all things share one principle—yet people do not follow Heaven’s way, instead acting contrary to it. Who understands this truth? This is the way of taking what is right.

Only the sage, though not yet sage, is the sage by this very means.

Ah! Heaven’s Dao is like the bow—relaxing after tension, the two *qi* forces cycling endlessly for whom? If one truly recognizes the mark at the center, all things and the bow alike are forgotten.

**Chapter 78: The World’s Softness and Weakness**
Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet nothing surpasses it in overcoming the hard and strong—none can replace it. Thus, the soft overcomes the hard, the weak overcomes the strong.

All know this, yet none can practice it. Therefore, the sage says:
*"Bear the nation’s filth—this is called the guardian of the ancestral altars;
Bear the nation’s misfortunes—this is called the ruler of the world."*
True words seem contrary.

Here, virtue is prized in constancy—constancy makes the soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.
To receive filth from below and form the sea, the sea’s work lies in enduring time.

Ah! Water conquers with softness—who does not know? Yet none can practice it, for they cannot maintain it.
Accumulating goodness and embracing breadth, unceasing and steadfast, virtue is complete, the Dao is fulfilled—Heaven and Earth all submit.

**Chapter 79: Reconciling Great Grievances**
To reconcile great grievances must leave lingering grievances—how can this be good? Thus, the sage holds the left contract yet does not demand repayment from others.

Therefore, one with virtue oversees the contract, one without oversees the tally.
Heaven’s Dao favors none—it always aligns with the virtuous.
Grievances should not arise, nor should they be reconciled—reconciliation without end only deepens the calamity.
The origin of grievances lies with others, yet blame returns here—the analogy of holding the contract reveals the logic of retribution.

What should be demanded is not demanded—only virtue is taken.
One with virtue holds virtue—this is called overseeing the contract.
*Simpèi* (彻) means "track"—its cyclical meaning is illustrated by overseeing the tally, where grievances persist unchecked.
Heaven’s Dao favors none—only the virtuous does it aid. The virtuous do not demand retribution—Heaven itself repays them.

Ah! All things vanish in boundless clarity—where are grievances? Where is virtue named?
If all were virtuous, from whence would Heaven’s aid come? In ancient times, green mountains remain green.

(*Simpèi* is also written as *zhé* 辙.)

**Chapter 80: Small States, Few People**
In small states with few people, let there be ten- or hundred-person tools yet leave them unused; let the people value death yet not flee far. Though there are boats and carriages, they have no use for them; though there are armor and weapons, they have no need to display them. Let the people return to knotted cords for record-keeping.

Let them find their food sweet, their clothing fine, their dwellings secure, their customs joyful.
Neighboring states are visible, the sounds of roosters and dogs heard between them—yet the people die of old age without visiting one another.
Relying on what is useless yet finding self-sufficiency in it,
The Dao runs parallel without contradiction, all things flourish yet each finds its place.
Their intentions are shared, yet their paths do not meet.
Ah! The sage’s embrace is vast—already complete in a hundred-li realm.

Ah! The Dao is naturally effortless, customs naturally pure—mountains, rivers, people, ancient as today.
The Azure Ox departs, leaving no trace—who knows the heart of its past service to the world?

**Chapter 81: True Words Are Not Ornate**
True words are not ornate; ornate words are not true.
The virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.
The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.
The sage accumulates nothing—yet the more they give to others, the more they possess; the more they bestow, the more they have.

Heaven’s Dao benefits without harming;
The sage’s Dao acts without striving.
Beautiful speech is flowery; true speech is plain.
Those who argue create strife; the virtuous create no ill.
Unity brings knowledge; multiplicity brings breadth.
The sage accumulates nothing—emptiness governs all, giving to others only increases their own abundance, mirroring the workings of creation, like the timing of deep springs.

Benefit without harm, action without strife—this is both Heaven and humanity, one yet not two.
All things are as they should be; all things are complete. Great is the Dao! By it, all begins and ends.

Ah! Not-speech, not-Dao—Dao is not-speech, speech is not-Dao.
Who knows the subtlety of argument and learning? The mystery is never passed on.
Human laws follow Heaven; Heaven follows the Dao—what does the Dao follow? It follows *ziran* (自然).
The *Morality and Virtue Classic* (道德真经) *Commentary and Praise* concludes here.

*"Although" and its success are one*—the word *"although"* (虽然) is likely superfluous.
