### **Preface to *The Original Purport of the Mysterious Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue***

The *Laozi* and the *Yijing* share the same Dao. The *Yijing* speaks of the Supreme Ultimate, yet the sacred scripture leaves it unelaborated. Its opening with *Qian* and *Kun* pertains to the Dao of the Posterior Heaven—modeled after heaven and earth, thus aligning the Confucian and Daoist paths with the workings of heaven and earth. The Supreme Change (*Taiyi*), unseen even in qi, is regarded by Daoists as the ancestor of the Great Dao, the nameless origin of heaven and earth, the Dao of the Prior Heaven. The Dao follows spontaneity, and thus the sage of old attained the wondrous return to nothingness. Alas! The entire *Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* is contained herein.

I have long held that the supreme Dao is not cumbersome, and so I once expressed it through diagrams and eulogies without daring to exhaust its meaning. One day, my nephew Jiancheng Xing arrived from Hangzhou and told me that he had recently met Master Du of Nangu. Their discussions often aligned with my diagrams and eulogies, and so he obtained Master Du’s work, *The Original Purport*. Upon reading it, I sighed that no one in this world had ever discussed these matters with such resonance—every word struck a chord within. It speaks of the mysterious as seemingly nonexistent, yet existence itself is again mysterious, seemingly existent yet nonexistent, the heaven that gives birth to all things. From this great revelation, the heaven of spontaneity endures, hidden yet ever-present.

It states: "Within the emptiness of the Supreme Ultimate dwells the Valley Spirit." The valley’s emptiness, responsive and good, is the heart; the spirit’s stillness, numinous and true, is nature. It declares: "The Supreme Ultimate is the primordial undifferentiated Great One; the Limitless is the formless Great Void before the Supreme Ultimate." It further says: "Of the ten aspects of the Dao as a thing, the Supreme Ultimate is one." All these are profound discourses. As the saying goes, "Build a cart behind closed doors, and it will match the tracks when taken out"—truly so!

If one encounters a work like this, the causes and effects of past and present become instantly clear. Within the five thousand words of the *Laozi*, its principles are thoroughly expounded and elucidated, confirming that this is no empty rhetoric. Lord Lao’s Dao extends beyond the earliest beginnings; his spirit roams the boundless ancient past. He lived through the late Zhou dynasty, witnessing all the changes under heaven. To leave teachings for ten thousand generations—what benevolence and righteousness could surpass this? Yet some criticize it without reflection.

Generally, the Dao and its virtue are spoken of in terms of the Limitless and the Supreme Ultimate, while benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust are expressed through yin-yang and the Five Phases. The sage’s treatment of heaven, earth, and the myriad things as straw dogs is deemed "without benevolence," yet this aligns with the Six Classics’ nurturing of benevolence. Consider the discussions on "supreme virtue and supreme benevolence," "losing the Dao and losing virtue," "rejecting benevolence and abandoning wisdom"—these describe the progression from the August to the Emperor, from the Emperor to the King. The Dao rises and falls, while the hegemons usurp benevolence, steal righteousness, and falsify propriety through cunning. *The Original Purport* truly grasps this meaning.

Moreover, it states that the Dao governs the fate of the people, unaware of the life-giving power of benevolence, the growth fostered by propriety, the completion brought by righteousness—only the concealment of wisdom is esteemed. This is like a year without spring, summer, or autumn, perpetually in winter. How profound!

Alas! The flow of the heavenly Dao and the shifts of the worldly Dao, once gone, do not return—such is the inevitable trend. To adapt and preserve them lies with humanity, and thus this classic was composed. It says: "Its essence is most true; within it lies sincerity." The sincerity of the Five Constants is the earth of the Five Phases; the Dao of the Prior Heaven’s Limitless and the Supreme Ultimate cannot be altered by ten thousand changes—this is what is called *cheng* (integrity). Having gathered the essential purport of the classic to cultivate nature and conduct, I append it at the end of the scroll.

### **Preface by Zhang Yucai**

The eighty-one chapters of the *Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* have been annotated by over three thousand scholars. Master Du of Nangu’s *Original Purport* begins with "The Purport of the Mysterious Classic," primarily addressed to rulers. It further states that the sage Lao composed the *Mysterious Classic* to elucidate the august Dao and the imperial virtue. Its grand principles and essential themes are made clear from the very first scroll.

In this world, the classic, when unfolded, fills the six directions; when rolled up, it enters the tiniest speck of dust. Its essence cannot be confined to one corner. *The Original Purport* grasps its greatness, and thus its lesser aspects cannot contradict it.

I have heard that Master Du of Nangu once accompanied Dongming in an imperial audience. Though he harbored earnest intentions, he did not have the chance to present this work. Perhaps his lifelong aspirations could not be expressed in his time, so he entrusted them to later generations. Those who obtain this work will achieve governance surpassing even that of Emperor Wen of Han. Master Du is truly extraordinary!

Written by Zhang Yucai, Inheritor of the Heavenly Master, on the Minor Snow of the *yisi* year of the Dade era.

### **Preface by Mou Yan**

In the cramped and dusty world, my heart is often troubled, and conversing with ordinary people brings no joy. When Master Du of Nangu arrived by boat, our discussions were transcendent, lifting my spirits. Together, we ascended the Cloud Peak of the Daoist sanctuary and lodged there. At midnight, by the light of a flickering lamp, he showed me his *Original Purport of Laozi*. I read through the night until dawn.

Master Du has studied extensively across all texts, and his work does more than merely elucidate the classic’s essential purport. On one chapter, he remarked, "This pertains to the affairs of Yao and Shun." On another, he said, "This concerns the deeds of Yu, King Wen, and King Wu." His interpretation treats Laozi as the Archivist of the Zhou, whose duty was to record history—and the hundred-chapter book is also history. Thus, he approached it through historical inquiry, which astonished me.

Ever since Sima Qian placed Laozi and Han Fei in the same biography, dissatisfaction has lingered for a thousand years. He Shanggong’s commentary on the *Laozi* frequently touches on breathing exercises and guiding-and-pulling techniques. Later, scholars like Sun Deng, Tao Hongjing, the Immortal of Pine Spirit, the Tang Daoist Cheng Xuanying, and Zhang Junxiang also annotated the *Laozi*. More recently, the immortalist Wang Fusi used the *Laozi* to interpret the *Yijing*, which some criticized. Yet his interpretation of the *Laozi* itself made no reference to the *Yijing*.

To Su Ziyou, who directly regarded it as an inheritance of enlightenment, a transmission of the lamp of the Śākya clan—how could the *Laozi* have foreseen that its later currents would reach such a state? Now, Master Du seeks it through the books of emperors and kings, cross-referencing it with their deeds. It is as if one emerges from darkness into light, from obscurity into grandeur, where the atmosphere and vision suddenly transform—how could this not be most fitting? Some say this is merely his *Origins of the Dao* commentary.

Alas, the world has yet to discern Master Du’s true intent. For long has the Way been fragmented, each clinging to their own biases, vying to establish sects, even preserving remnants and guarding gaps to disparage others. None are willing to set aside their prejudices and seek the convergence of truth. Though Master Du titles his work *Original Purport*, he does not adhere to a single school. He harmonizes only with principle, follows only the classics, and venerates only what is correct, striving to leave no room for doubt in later generations regarding his master’s teachings. Such is his intent—truly magnanimous. How could it fundamentally differ from the *Origins of the Dao*?

I, being of limited understanding, have not deeply examined the *Original Purport*, but I shall briefly discuss its general meaning.

Scholars of the Laozi’s teachings invariably favor Laozi over Confucius. The followers of Liezi and Zhuangzi go so far as to exalt their masters by disparaging Yao, Shun, and Confucius, using them as foils. Thus, Confucians label them as heterodox, and the teachings of Confucius and Laozi diverge into two paths. Yet the Laozi’s teachings were not inherently at odds with Confucianism. Its Way transcends being to function in non-being, gathering emptiness to transform the substantial, directly aiming to replace sagely wisdom and benevolence with a world of plain simplicity. Confucians often recoil at its radical renunciations, but how could they know whether such words are feigned or genuine?

When its principles are applied well, the Western Han governed through tranquility. When followed poorly to the extreme, the Western Jin perished through vacuity. Must one abandon all restraints and standards to claim it differs from what I call the Way?

Master Du of Nangu, in his study of this teaching, does not interpret the Laozi’s text through Daoist doctrines. Instead, he draws from Confucianism to illuminate it. Through meticulous analysis of chapters and phrases, he ensures coherence without fragmentation, preferring not to dissect it piecemeal. By drawing analogies and comparing meanings, he fully incorporates the Way of the Five Emperors, the Three Kings, and the teachings of Confucius and Mencius into his explanations. It is like the five colors adapting to their subjects, blending harmoniously into brilliance; like the five notes, high and low, clear and deep, resonating to form a perfect melody; like thirty spokes converging at a single hub, each taking different paths east and west, yet ultimately aligning in their tracks. In my view, his work achieves unity.

The Laozi’s teachings aspire to restore the governance of knotted cords—a practice of Fuxi and Shen Nong from the distant past. Its discourse on the Valley Spirit traces back to the Yellow Emperor; its esteem for non-action resembles Shun; its valuing of humility and lack of boasting mirrors Yu. Countless subtle words and profound meanings align with the Six Classics. Observing the convergence of all schools, to claim Confucius and Laozi do not belong to the same tradition—I do not believe it.

Master Du, as one who has heard the Dao and progressed from subtlety to wonder, harmonizing differences into unity, embodies what Sima Qian called the Daoist spirit: single-minded, yet incorporating the strengths of Confucianism. Is this not so?

In my youth, when I first took office in Wuxing, I once drifted along Fengxi. Now, in old age, one day Master Du sent a letter through a mutual friend, presenting me with his *Original Purport*. Though I have not fully grasped its meaning, I privately admire his exhaustive and erudite synthesis.

Readers should examine it in detail for themselves.

Written by the remnant subject Xu Tianyu, courtesy name Siwanfu, at Yichu Mountain Studio.

I recall Sima Qian’s record of the Western Capital during the reign of Emperor Wen of Han, when the people lived in joy, and elders of sixty or seventy played like children. The prosperity of that golden age can still be imagined. Was this not the result of studying the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s teachings of tranquility? Yet the Han is not our only evidence.

The essence of the Laozi’s text lies in non-action and non-contention. These were the practices of the ancient sage-kings, which even Tang and Wu found difficult to uphold. As the Zhou declined, a purple aura crossed the pass westward. Moved by the times, Laozi composed his five thousand words, then departed, concealing his intent and deepening his hopes for the age. Once the text spread, it naturally found adherents. Yet its scholars—whether wielding the harsh techniques of Legalism or the abstruse theories of immortality—failed to mutually illuminate, instead turning to mutual criticism. Moreover, with hundreds of commentaries, few have truly grasped the original meaning of the classic.

Master Du of Nangu’s *Original Purport*, the last to emerge, decisively declares: This is my master’s exploration of ancient history, expounding the Way of Fuxi, the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun. As Laozi served as the Archivist of the Zhou, the past was not distant, and the governance of "wearing robes and knotting cords" remained vividly before his eyes. No record is more trustworthy than history. To verify it through ancient history and make it easily credible—this truly begins with Master Du.

Ban Gu described Daoists as "vacuous and self-contained," aligning with Yao’s abdication, yet overlooking the ruler’s role. His *Treatise on the Nine Schools* separates Confucianism from Daoism, tracing the Dao’s origin to the Heavenly Sage. Yet the Sage’s transmission—nameless, designated only as the Dao—was later monopolized as a school. Was this truly Laozi’s intent? If his teachings were applied today, they would purely return to the ancient Way of Confucius, offering great assistance.

Master Du, hailing from the Confucian tradition yet studying the Laozi’s teachings, does not favor one over the other but reconciles both. How admirable! Though I am dull and have not fully grasped his intent, I hope one day to retreat to the mountains, sharing a patch of land beneath the white clouds, to resolve doubts and clarify uncertainties—perhaps gaining insight beyond mere words and texts.

*Original Purport of the Mysterious Classic of Dao and Virtue*, Volume One
Annotated by Du Daojian, Eminent Scholar of the Daoist Teachings of Dangtu

The *Classic* states:
The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
Named, it is the mother of the myriad things.
Through constant non-being, one observes its mystery.
Through constant being, one observes its manifestations.
These two emerge together yet differ in name;
Together they are called the profound.
Profound and again profound—
The gateway to all mysteries.

The *Original Purport* states:
Heaven is the ancestor of all things; the Dao is the ancestor of Heaven.
Heaven does not speak of the Dao—how can it be spoken? What can be spoken is not the Dao.
It is said: "Cannot be spoken, cannot be named"—this is the natural Heaven, constant and unchanging.
This is prior to Heaven.
That which "can be spoken, can be named" is the Heaven that generates things, changing yet not constant.
This is posterior to Heaven.
Here we see the beginning of Heaven and Earth, the mother of the myriad things, the evidence of mystery, the interplay of being and non-being—again profound, encompassing the primordial origin of great transformation, leaving nothing unincluded.
Observing the mystery of constant non-being, one perceives the nameless beginning.
Perceiving the nameless beginning, one sees the Limitless and the Supreme Ultimate.
Observing the manifestations of constant being, one perceives the named mother.
Perceiving the named mother, one sees the Two Modes and the myriad things.
These two originally share the same beginning, emerge from the same mother, yet differ in name.
Doubling them again and again, one perceives the profound and again profound—
The gateway to all mysteries.
The Heaven that generates things becomes manifest through this.
The natural Heaven remains subtly enduring.
Above form, below form—Heaven is this Dao, I am this Dao.
Words beyond words, names beyond names—what need is there for more speech?
Heaven does not speak; the sage also wishes to remain silent. Alas!
Lofty words do not reach the hearts of the multitude; ultimate words do not surpass common speech.
Thus, the sage does not speak, yet cannot but speak.
When the mysterious sage journeyed west, the Keeper of the Pass, Yin Xi, knowing that the great Dao was about to withdraw, compelled him to write a book.
Reluctantly, he spoke, saying:
"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name."
Master Guan Yin said: "The Dao cannot be spoken; if it cannot be spoken, then the correct Dao is precisely this."
This is the explanation of the Dao.
Between Heaven and Earth, the two qi recombine as one—this is called the harmonious void.
The harmonious void embodies the essence of the Supreme Ultimate, the root of generation and transformation.
The Three Powers are established, and the human Dao arises.
The *Book* states: "Only Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things; only humans are the spirits of the myriad things."
From constant non-being upward, we speak of the Dao of Heaven; below, we speak of the human Dao.
If one can observe the Dao of Heaven and cultivate the human Dao, there is none who will not enter the realm of the sage.
The *Classic of the Hidden Correspondence* states: "Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp the movements of Heaven—this is perfection."
Constant non-being is prior to Heaven; observing mystery, one sees the inherent self.
Constant being is posterior to Heaven; observing manifestations, one sees the undying self.
Tracing its beginning, formless gives rise to form; tracing its end, form returns to formlessness.
Observing the comings and goings of daily affairs and the movements of the heart-mind, none lie outside this Dao.
These two emerge from the same Dao yet differ in name.
Their sameness lies in this Dao.
The profound is one yet two, two yet one.
The profound seems non-being yet is being; again profound, it seems being yet is non-being—this is the myriad things.
The gateway implies entry and exit: the myriad things emerge from the mechanism and return to the mechanism.
The body contains Heaven and Earth; the heart-mind contains the Supreme Ultimate.
Knowing, yet never born; never dying.
Alas! The heart-mind of the sage is the heart-mind of Heaven and Earth.
Observing the morning mists and evening clouds of Heaven and Earth, ever-changing yet impermanent, while the great void remains unchanged—
One knows that when the sage responds to the myriad affairs, his heart-mind is quiescent, and his celestial nature remains undisturbed.
I have often said: Heaven and Earth are the great body; my body is the small Heaven and Earth.
Like Yao’s boundless virtue—
"The people could not name it"—
This may be called the sagely person of the Dao.
The *Classic* states:
When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises.
When all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises.
Thus, being and non-being give rise to each other;
Difficulty and ease complete each other;
Long and short shape each other;
High and low incline toward each other;
Sound and voice harmonize with each other;
Front and back follow each other.
Therefore, the sage dwells in non-action and practices the teaching without words.
The myriad things arise, yet he does not reject them;
He gives life yet does not possess;
He acts yet does not rely;
He accomplishes yet does not dwell.
Only because he does not dwell does he not depart.

The *Original Purport* states:
The Dao stands alone, without counterpart; once there is duality, it becomes a thing.
Things take form, and beauty and ugliness, goodness and not-goodness arise.
If Heaven and Earth possess great beauty yet do not speak of it, if Yao possesses great goodness yet does not know it—
Then what ugliness or not-goodness could there be?
Once there is self-pride or self-promotion, a desire for others to know oneself—
Beauty becomes ugliness, goodness becomes not-goodness.
How much more so if one desires all under Heaven to know?
The ancients, when possessing goodness, feared others knowing.
Today, when possessing goodness, one fears others not knowing.
How shallow this is!
The purport of the *Mysterious Classic* was originally addressed to the ruler.
The ruler is the teacher and elder of all under Heaven.
What the ruler above favors, those below will follow.
The *Book* states: "Following the good brings fortune; following the perverse brings misfortune—like an echo following sound."
Alas! It is not the shadow that moves the form, but the form that moves the shadow.
It is not the valley that moves the sound, but the sound that moves the valley.
Can one not be cautious about this?
Thus, being and non-being, difficulty and ease, long and short, high and low, sound and voice, front and back—
These six pairs give rise to and complete each other, shape and incline toward each other, harmonize and follow each other.
All possess duality—this is the inevitable principle.
Therefore, the sage acts through non-action and teaches without words.

Non-action does not mean inaction, but acting without contrivance. Non-speaking does not mean silence, but sparing the trouble of decrees and admonitions. Allowing the people and all things to act, grow, and function on their own—without refusal, possession, or reliance—thus can one achieve the work of nurturing life. When the work is accomplished, one does not claim credit, and so the merit does not depart. Should it be otherwise, the merit will vanish.

The *Classic* refers to sages only from the sovereigns of remote antiquity down to Yao; thereafter, it speaks of kings, dukes, marquises, good men, noble persons, and great men. Distinctions in virtue are made, and praise or censure is implied—scholars must view this with the eyes of the ancients, observing the era before the Zhou and the Warring States.

The *Classic* states:
Do not exalt the worthy, and the people will not contend.
Do not prize rare goods, and the people will not steal.
Do not display what is desirable, and the people’s hearts will not be disordered.
Thus, in the sage’s governance, he empties their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their ambitions, and strengthens their bones, ever keeping the people without cunning or desire. He ensures that the clever dare not act; by acting through non-action, nothing remains ungoverned.

The *Original Meaning* states:
The ancient sage composed the *Mysterious Classic* to illuminate the imperial Dao and the virtue of emperors. The world is vast, and things are manifold—what exists in the world must not exist in me. If those above exalt their own superiority over others, prize rare goods, or display their desires, then those below will take these three as their hearts’ aims: they will contend, steal, and create disorder. Only when I have no desires will they, though rewarded, not covet. Thus, in governing the world, the sage must first empty his own mind, not obstructing affairs; fill his own belly, not allowing evil to enter; weaken his own ambitions, not competing with things; and strengthen his own bones, not opposing with force. He constantly keeps the people from transgressive knowledge and usurping desires. Even if there were one as wise as the giant Longbo, who could hook the six great turtles, he would not dare to commit the slightest transgression or usurpation—how then could there be rebellious ministers or treacherous sons? The rulers of remote antiquity governed the world by acting without contrivance, and so nothing remained ungoverned.

The *Classic* states:
The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.
Abysmal! It seems the ancestor of the myriad things.
Blunting its sharpness, untying its tangles,
Harmonizing its light, uniting with its dust—
Profound! It seems ever present.
I know not whose child it is; it seems the image of what preceded the Lord.

The *Original Meaning* states:
That which governs Heaven and Earth and administers the myriad things is the mind. The mind is the pivot of the Dao; all people possess this mind, and in this mind, the Dao resides. Only through its empty subtlety and wondrous function, its abysmal stillness and capacity, can it embrace the six directions without appearing full. Its knowledge pervades the myriad things without departing from its source. Once this Dao is obscured by things, the mind becomes as if blocked by thatch. When responding to affairs and engaging with things, one must first rectify what lies within, and then what lies without will not disturb. At the first hint of entanglement or sharpness disturbing the center, one must blunt and untie it. When purity is thorough, one can harmonize light and dust, coexisting without conflict. Thus, one’s empty subtlety and wondrous function, luminous and penetrating, lie hidden within—profound, as if ever present. To regard it as mine, I know not whose child it is; to regard it as not mine, it yet resembles the image of what preceded my spirit and lord. Unless one is clear and bright, with a spirit-like will and qi, who could comprehend this?

The *Classic* states:
Heaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat the myriad things as straw dogs.
The sage is not benevolent; he treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.
The space between Heaven and Earth—is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet inexhaustible, the more it moves, the more it produces.
Much speech leads to exhaustion; it is better to hold to the center.

The *Original Meaning* states:
Heaven’s duty is to cover, Earth’s duty is to bear, and the sage’s duty is to transform. Enabling the myriad things and the hundred clans to each fulfill their lives, and though they accomplish this, they do not regard it as benevolence—such is the utmost benevolence. Not regarding it as benevolence, they have no expectation of reward, and thus, like straw dogs, no thought of discarding things. It is like the state’s sacrificial offerings, where straw dogs are bound for the spirits. During the sacrifice, though the straw dog is humble, it must be set out; once the rite is complete, though the embroidered silk is noble, it must be removed. How could there be a mind that distinguishes between noble and base? It is simply a matter of what is fitting. Moreover, the myriad things and the hundred clans are what Heaven and Earth rely upon to perfect their virtue of covering and bearing, and what the sage relies upon to perfect his work of transformation—how should they be treated? Observe the space between Heaven and Earth, like a bellows: empty yet capacious, it does not exhaust; moving without losing the center, it produces ever more. The sounds of Heaven’s pipes are myriad and different, yet if they arise of themselves, each takes what it will—who is the one who forces them? The sage’s relation to the hundred clans is the same. Should he act much or speak often, issuing frequent decrees, he will soon be exhausted. One must regard Heaven and Earth as a bellows, empty the mind to embody the Dao, and truly hold to the center—this is how Yao, reverent and silent in non-action, treated all equally as straw, and the world was governed.

The *Classic* states:
The valley spirit does not die; it is called the Mysterious Female.
The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
Subtle and continuous, as if present—its use is inexhaustible.

The *Original Meaning* states:
The valley spirit is the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is empty at its center, and the valley spirit resides there. Heaven has this valley spirit, and humans have this valley spirit—its nature as a valley is the same. Mysterious and identical with yin and yang, it embraces and contains creation; its spirit is the wondrous functioning of the myriad things. Only because it does not die can it generate and transform without end. The Mysterious Female is yin and yang.

The gate is the portal through which Qian and Kun undergo their transformations; the root is the source from which the myriad transformations arise. "Subtle and continuous, as if present"—this endures from ancient times to the present without cease. "Its use is inexhaustible"—this arises from spontaneity.

This passage elaborates upon the preceding chapter’s analogy of the bellows and the key to Heaven and Earth, revealing that the Supreme Ultimate within our hearts and the Dao of our bodies as Heaven and Earth flow in unison with the Creator, never born and never dying. The valley’s emptiness responds with perfect receptivity, serving as a metaphor for our hearts. The spirit’s stillness engenders numinosity, serving as an analogy for our nature. In the midst of profound quiescence, one perceives the wondrous resonance of responsiveness—only then is the meaning of "not dying" revealed. Yet spirit cannot arise without qi, nor can qi be numinous without spirit. Where spirit is spoken of, qi is already present. When spirit and qi intermingle and merge, only then is the Mysterious Female manifest.

The Mysterious (Xuan) takes root in Heaven, possessing the virtue of the Father—it is the origin of spirit. The Female (Pin) takes root in Earth, possessing the virtue of the Mother—it is the origin of qi. Is not the Mysterious Female the Heaven and Earth within our bodies? The gate is where spirit and qi return to their origin, the place of their interaction, as if something were present. Inhaling and exhaling, yet none perceive the gate—thus may the opening and closing of our bodies be seen. The root is where spirit and qi return to their origin, the ground of their intermingling, as if something were present. Generation after generation, transformation after transformation, yet none perceive the root—thus may the Supreme Ultimate within our bodies be seen. Observing its "as if present" within the continuous flow, one finds its "inexhaustible use." From this, we may understand how the Old Sage, spanning the Shang and Zhou dynasties for over nine hundred years, mastered the essentials of cultivating the Dao and nurturing longevity—all encompassed herein.

The *Liezi* also contains this passage, though it attributes it not to Laozi but to the Yellow Emperor. The *Book* states: It is evident that Laozi’s *Five Thousand Characters* draws extensively from the ancient words of the *Canon* and *Classic*. For instance, wherever the *Classic* speaks of "therefore the sage," "what the ancients called," "it is said in established teachings," "thus the sages declared," or "there are words on the use of arms," it clearly cites the transmitted sayings of the ancient sages. Thus, Confucius, though he "transmitted but did not create," subtly aligned himself with them. Only those who "believe in and delight in antiquity" may be spoken to of this Dao.

The *Classic* states:
Heaven is eternal, Earth enduring.
The reason Heaven and Earth can be eternal and enduring
Is that they do not live for themselves—
Thus they can long endure.
Therefore the sage places himself last yet finds himself first,
Considers himself external yet finds himself preserved.
Is it not because he is selfless?
Thus he fulfills his self.

The *Original Meaning* states:
Heaven’s eternity and Earth’s endurance cannot be surpassed. Yet by what principle do Heaven and Earth attain their long and enduring nature? The heart of Heaven and Earth is one with all things, capable of generating life without taking self-preservation as its own life. Thus, nothing harms them, and they attain long life. Observing this, the sage embodies the Dao in action, free from the slightest trace of self-interest. He knows only to place the world before himself and to internalize the Dao while externalizing his own person. Thus, though he places himself last, he is inevitably first—people push him forward. Though he considers himself external, he is inevitably preserved—nothing harms him. The body is one’s closest possession, yet to place it last and externalize it is fundamentally selfless. By placing oneself last and externalizing oneself, one paradoxically finds oneself first and preserved—self-interest is thus fulfilled. How could the sage intentionally seek self-interest? It is precisely through selflessness that he fulfills his self-interest. The sage governs Heaven and Earth and administers the myriad things, yet never selfishly preserves his own life. Only by not living for himself does the vitality of life endure.

The *Classic* states:
The highest virtue is like water.
Water benefits the myriad things yet contends not;
It dwells in places all others disdain—
Thus it is near to the Dao.
In dwelling, be like the earth.
In the heart, be like the abyss.
In association, be like kindness.
In speech, be like truth.
In governance, be like order.
In affairs, be like capability.
In action, be like timeliness.
Only by not contending
Does one avoid blame.

The *Original Meaning* states:
The highest virtue is perfect virtue. The nature of water is perfectly virtuous. The person of highest virtue is humble and lowly, possessing the virtue of water. When Yu served as Minister of Works, he had already grasped the goodness of water’s nature, enabling him to fully realize water’s nature and accomplish the work of regulating the waters. From the highest virtue, he effortlessly entered the realm of the sage. There is no other reason—he simply acted without contrivance. Mencius said, "No person is without goodness; no water is without downward flow"—there is indeed a reason for this. Water benefits things without contention, dwelling in places all disdain, thus it is near to the Dao. Water’s virtues are manifold. The *Classic* lists seven; the rest may be inferred by analogy. Abiding where it dwells, it is "good at dwelling in the earth." Clear and deep, undisturbed, it is "good at the heart like the abyss." Moistening things without partiality, it is "good at association like kindness." Flowing downward without change, it is "good at speech like truth." Softness overcoming strength, it is "good at governance like order." Bearing the heavy and floating the light, it is "good at affairs like capability." Waxing and waning without loss, it is "good at action like timeliness." If one can emulate water’s virtue, conduct oneself with goodness, and contend with nothing, what blame could there be? At the moment of Yao’s transmission to Shun and Shun’s to Yu, they should have been most diligent in humility and non-boasting, contending with none. Only Yu was truly worthy of contending for merit.

The *Classic* states:
To hold and fill it to the brim
Is not as good as stopping in time.
To hammer and sharpen it to a point
Cannot be long preserved.
When gold and jade fill the hall,
None can guard them.
Wealth and honor leading to arrogance
Bring calamity upon oneself.
When merit is achieved and fame established, withdraw—
This is the Dao of Heaven.

The *Original Meaning* states:
Humility leads to increase, fullness to loss; hardness breaks, softness endures—this is the inevitable principle of Heaven. Thus, one who understands the noble must restrain himself, and the sharp must be swiftly blunted—this is the way of the wise in preserving themselves. If one holds fullness without caution or sharpens a point without concealment, the vessel will surely overturn, and the blade will surely break—its inability to be long preserved is clear. When gold and jade fill the hall, who can guard them? Wealth and honor leading to arrogance bring calamity upon oneself.

Those who occupy high positions, bearing heavy seals of office, grow arrogant, extravagant, dissolute, and insatiable—never knowing moderation or contentment. When the tripod shatters and the cauldron overturns, none can preserve their vital essence, and all perish without meeting a natural end. How much better is the gourd on Mount Ji or the single boat on the Five Lakes! Thus we know: merit need not be great—only those who know when to stop succeed. Fame need not be lofty—only those who know contentment attain fulfillment.

How few in this world escape the net of profit, break free from the tether of fame, withdraw from the rushing current, and preserve themselves in accord with the Dao of Heaven! To achieve merit and retire—this is the Dao of Heaven, grasped only by Yao and Shun.

The *Classic* states:
Carry your soul and embrace the One—can you never part from it?
Concentrate your qi and attain suppleness—can you be like an infant?
Purify and refine your profound vision—can you be without blemish?
Love the people and govern the state—can you do so without action?
The gates of Heaven open and close—can you remain feminine?
Understand the four directions—can you do so without knowledge?
Give life and nurture, yet do not possess;
Act, yet do not rely;
Lead, yet do not dominate—
This is called profound virtue.

The *Original Meaning* states:
Only by cultivating the self can one govern the state, for the self is like the state, and the hundred limbs like the multitude. Thus the noble person cannot but cultivate the self. Human life carries the soul and embraces the One—can it hold them without separation? If not separated, it becomes One. Qi is the master of the hundred limbs; concentrate your qi and attain suppleness—can you be like an infant? If like an infant, you attain suppleness. The profound cannot be seen; purify and refine your vision—can you be without blemish? Without blemish, you attain the profound. To love the people and govern the state, value preservation and peace—can you do so without action? Without action, you attain peace. The gates of Heaven open and close; value stillness and guard it—can you remain feminine? If feminine, you attain stillness. To understand the four directions, value unimpeded clarity—can you do so without knowledge? Without knowledge, you are not obstructed.

One who embodies these six attainments, cultivating the self and governing the state, gives life through the Dao and nurtures through virtue. Each thing and self attains its natural course—giving life, acting, leading, yet not possessing, not relying, not dominating. This is why the people of Emperor Yao knew nothing, understood nothing, and asked, "What has the emperor’s power to do with us?"—this is called profound virtue.

The *Classic* states:
Thirty spokes share one hub;
Where it is empty, lies the use of the wheel.
Clay is shaped into a vessel;
Where it is empty, lies the use of the vessel.
Doors and windows are cut to make a room;
Where it is empty, lies the use of the room.
Thus, being serves as advantage,
Non-being serves as use.

The *Original Meaning* states:
The sage observes images to create tools, benefiting the world—there is wisdom in this. Movement is round, stillness square—these are the images of Heaven and Earth. Their emptiness is their use. Qi forms the sun, moon, and stars; shape forms mountains, rivers, and plants. Being exists within non-being, non-being within being—nothing is excluded. Thirty spokes share one hub: the wheel’s roundness images Heaven, the carriage’s square images Earth—this is the "being" of the cart. Its emptiness is its "non-being." Where it is empty lies the cart’s use. Observing how the hollow hub turns and the empty carriage bears, we see that form serves the advantage of the formless, and the formless serves the use of form—its wonder lies therein.

The *Classic* speaks of the wheel’s spokes and hub but not of the wheel, carriage, shaft, or traces—yet in speaking of the cart, its entirety is implied. The same principle applies to shaping clay into vessels or cutting doors and windows to make a room. The Dao speaks of being and non-being, the *Book of Changes* of movement and stillness—both are one. Clarify the non-being of the Dao, and you see the stillness of the *Changes*. Clarify the movement of the *Changes*, and you see the being of the Dao. The meaning of being and non-being, the mechanism of movement and stillness—how vast they are!

The *Classic* states:
The five colors blind the eyes,
The five tones deafen the ears,
The five flavors dull the palate,
Racing and hunting madden the mind,
Rare goods corrupt conduct.
Thus the sage is for the belly, not the eyes—
Therefore he rejects that and chooses this.

The *Original Meaning* states:
When the sage is above, he serves as a model for the people, and the world follows his example. What those above favor, those below emulate—like wind and cloud responding to dragon and tiger, or water and fire to moisture and dryness, without need for summoning. Thus, whatever is vain, extravagant, and harmful to the people’s livelihood is rejected and not chosen.

Knowing that the five colors dazzle and blind the eyes, he does not pursue adornment but guards purity and simplicity. Knowing that the five tones confuse and deafen the ears, he does not indulge in lewd music but guards silence and stillness. Knowing that the five flavors cloy and dull the palate, he does not seek delicacies but guards frugality and plainness. Knowing that racing and hunting madden the mind, he does not indulge in frivolous amusements but guards tranquility and constancy. Knowing that rare goods corrupt conduct, he does not pursue worldly treasures but guards the Heavenly nobility.

These five are all extravagances that agitate the true nature and harm the people’s livelihood—no benefit to sustaining life. They are not the way of filling the belly, strengthening the root, and enduring long. Thus the sage values the substance of the belly, not the splendor of the eyes. Therefore he rejects that and chooses this, practicing frugality himself to encourage the people. He seeks to transform the world naturally, so each person is content, no external desires usurp their nature, and the world is governed.

The *Classic* states:
Favor and disgrace are both startling;
Regard great calamity as you do your body.
What is meant by "favor and disgrace are both startling"?
Favor is lowly—
To gain it is startling, to lose it is startling—
This is what is meant by "favor and disgrace are both startling."
What is meant by "regard great calamity as you do your body"?
The reason I have great calamity
Is that I have a body.
If I had no body,
What calamity could I have?
Thus, one who values the self as the world
May be entrusted with the world;
One who loves the self as the world
May be charged with the world.

The *Original Meaning* states:
The sage values the self through the Dao, while the multitude values the self through fame—how vastly different they are!

To value the self through the Dao is non-action. To value the self through fame is to act without cease for the self. Favor and disgrace are both startling—where there is favor, there is disgrace; how could one not be startled? To regard great calamity as one does the self: whether valuing the self or valuing fame, the calamity is the same.

What is meant by "favor and disgrace"? Favor is lowly, and fame is thereby manifest. To gain it is startling, to lose it is startling—fearing loss and coveting gain, both are equally startling. What is meant by "regarding great calamity as one does the self"? The reason I have great calamity is that I have a self, and having a self means clinging to things. Clinging to things, one cannot escape the burden of fame. Without a self, one forgets things; forgetting things, the burden of fame is cast off. This is spoken for those who value the self through fame. The sage values the self through the Dao—what weariness could there be?

Knowing fame is not worth valuing, one sees the value of the self. Knowing the self is not worth valuing, one sees the value of the Dao. Seeing the value of the Dao, what calamity could I have? When Han and Wei contended over land, Master Zihua advised Marquis Zhaoxi to cast off his two arms in exchange for the world. The marquis refused—thus his two arms were heavier than the world. The self is heavier than two arms, and the Dao is heavier still than the self.

When the noble person is compelled to govern the world, they must be able to value the self as the world—such valuing may entrust them with the world. To love the self as the world—such love may charge them with the world. "Valuing" speaks of position; "loving" speaks of virtue. Valuing position allows one to be entrusted; loving virtue allows one to be charged. Yet knowing position may be relinquished while virtue cannot, then favor and disgrace become light—what calamity could I have?

The *Classic* states:
Look and it cannot be seen—it is called *Yi*.
Listen and it cannot be heard—it is called *Xi*.
Grasp and it cannot be held—it is called *Wei*.
These three cannot be fathomed,
Thus they merge into one.
Above, it is not bright;
Below, it is not dark.
Endless, it cannot be named,
Returning to nothingness.
This is called the formless form,
The imageless image,
Called the indistinct and evanescent.
Meet it and you do not see its beginning;
Follow it and you do not see its end.
Hold to the ancient Dao
To master the present being.
To know the ancient beginning
Is called the thread of the Dao.

The *Original Meaning* states:
One cannot but know the Dao; the Dao cannot but know the ancient. The ancient must have a beginning, and the beginning must have something. The things of the world are many—what thing is not the Dao? What Dao is not a thing? It cannot be named. Seek it by sight, by hearing, by grasping—*Yi*, unseen; *Xi*, unheard; *Wei*, unobtainable. Question it with words, yet it cannot be reached, thus it merges into one. Observe its above—it is not bright; observe its below—it is not dark. Endless, it cannot be named; once named, it returns to nothingness. The formless form, the imageless image, indistinct and evanescent—meet it and you do not see its beginning; follow it and you do not see its end. Thereby one sees that nothing is not the Dao, and no Dao is not a thing—the Dao is thus. If one can hold to this ancient, wondrously formless Dao to govern the wondrously formed present, not only may one perfect the self, but may also order the world, returning all to the Dao. Who would then be bound by things?

The *Classic* states:
The ancients who were good as scholars
Were subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating,
Too deep to be known.
It is only because they could not be known
That I force descriptions of them:
Hesitant, as if crossing a winter stream;
Cautious, as if fearing neighbors on all sides;
Reserved, as if a guest;
Yielding, as ice about to melt;
Simple, as uncarved wood;
Vast, as a valley;
Opaque, as muddy water.
Who can make the muddy clear through stillness?
Who can make the still come to life through movement?
One who preserves this Dao does not desire fullness.
It is only because they are not full
That they can be worn yet newly made.

The *Original Meaning* states:
The ancients who were good as scholars embraced the Dao and dwelled in constancy, cultivating hidden virtue, flowing with the world without self-importance. They attained the subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating principle, which the multitude could not know. Only because they could not be known do I force descriptions of them—like the seven "as ifs" below, all embodying the mean, neither leaning nor drifting.

Hesitant, as if crossing a winter stream—no hasty advance.
Cautious, as if fearing neighbors on all sides—no reckless movement.
Reserved, as if a guest—no wantonness.
Yielding, as ice about to melt—no rigidity.
Simple, as uncarved wood—no adornment.
Vast, as a valley—no obstruction.
Opaque, as muddy water—no artifice.

Who can make the muddy clear through stillness? Who can make the still come to life through movement? The order and disorder, safety and danger of human affairs are like the waxing and waning of heaven’s way—movement reaches its extreme and turns to stillness; stillness reaches its extreme and turns to movement. Had Qu Yuan known this Dao, his loyalty would not have led to drowning. Had Bo Yi known this Dao, his purity would not have led to starvation. Thus it is said: One who preserves this Dao does not desire fullness, having no insistence on fulfilling the self. Only without insisting on fulfilling the self can one be worn yet newly made—speaking of abiding in constancy without great change. The Old Sage passed through the two dynasties of Shang and Zhou, thrice parted at the Pass, four times entered the archives, wandering for over nine hundred years, and in his later years journeyed to the shifting sands—none knew his end. This is how to be good.

The *Classic* states:
Attain utmost emptiness,
Abide in profound stillness.
The ten thousand things arise together,
And I observe their return.
Things flourish abundantly,
Each returning to its root.
Returning to the root is called stillness;
Stillness is called returning to life;
Returning to life is called constancy.
Knowing constancy is called illumination.
Not knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune.
Knowing constancy, one is all-embracing;
All-embracing, one is impartial;
Impartial, one is kingly;
Kingly, one is heavenly;
Heavenly, one is of the Dao;
Of the Dao, one is enduring.
To the end of life, one is not imperiled.

*The Original Purport* states:
Before the ten thousand things, there was Heaven and Earth;
before Heaven and Earth, there was the Supreme Polarity;
before the Supreme Polarity, there was utter emptiness and perfect stillness—
an unformed One abiding therein, which is the root of Heaven and Earth.
Yet it does not speak of attaining the Supreme Polarity but of governing utmost emptiness,
for utmost emptiness is the Nameless.
At the inception of utmost emptiness and profound stillness,
the ten thousand things arise together,
and I observe their return—
thus the heart of Heaven and Earth is revealed.
Things flourish abundantly,
each returning to its root.
Returning to the root is called stillness;
stillness is called returning to life;
returning to life is called constancy.
Knowing constancy is called illumination.
From this perspective,
my own return to the root and restoration to life
reveal their constancy and illumination.
Not knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune—
one strays far from the Dao.
Knowing constancy, one is all-embracing—
stillness and emptiness.
All-embracing, one is impartial—
emptiness and vastness.
Impartial, one is kingly—
vastness to which all under Heaven return.
Kingly, one is heavenly—
man models himself on Heaven.
Heavenly, one is of the Dao—
Heaven models itself on the Dao.
Of the Dao, one is enduring—
the Dao models itself on spontaneity.
To the end of life, one is not imperiled—
thus it is clear that before the Supreme Polarity,
there abides an utterly empty, perfectly still, unformed One,
and in its imperilment lies its enduring nature.

The *Classic* states:
Of the highest,
those below merely know of its existence.
Next,
they draw near and praise it.
Next,
they fear it and revile it.
Where trust is insufficient,
there is distrust.
How solemnly it treasures its words!
Its work complete, its affairs accomplished,
the hundred clans say, "We are naturally so."

*The Original Purport* states:
In the age of remote antiquity,
men dwelt in nests and caves,
free from taxes, levies, and corvée labor,
from rites, music, punishments, and laws,
from canons, models, instructions, and admonitions.
Those below knew only that a ruler existed above,
and those above knew only that the people existed below—
all was harmonious, spontaneous, and non-action.
Next, the Three Sovereigns introduced the first stroke,
established writing and contracts,
and taught the people the use of nets, plows, boats, and carts—
thus the world first had action.
The people reaped its benefits,
and the world drew near.
Next, the Five Emperors instituted rites, music, laws, and measures—
the people gained security,
and the world praised them.
Next, Qi attacked Youhu, Tang exiled Jie, and King Wu overthrew Zhou—
weapons were drawn,
and the world feared them.
Next, King Zhao marched south, King Yi descended the hall, King Ping moved east,
and men inquired about the cauldrons and challenged succession—
the world reviled them.
This arose from nothing else:
the trust of those above in those below was insufficient,
and the trust of those below in those above was lacking.
In the governance of Tang Yao,
the people knew not and could not name it—
what words were there to treasure?
As the saying goes: "The highest establishes virtue;
next, merit;
next, words"—
these are not sought but arise of necessity.
Alas! From remote antiquity to the Five Hegemons,
observing how those below knew of its existence, drew near, praised, feared, or reviled it—
in a few words, not a single ancient name is mentioned,
yet it encompasses thousands of generations,
implicitly discernible—
truly profound indeed!
Thus I know this is the nameless ancient history.

Guanzi also said: In the governance of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang,
all under Heaven called it "natural."

The *Classic* states:
When the Great Dao declined, there arose benevolence and righteousness.
When wisdom and cleverness emerged, there arose great falsity.
When the six relations fell into disharmony, there arose filial piety and compassion.
When the state fell into chaos and disorder, there arose loyal ministers.

*The Original Purport* states:
With the rise of the Three Sovereigns, the Great Dao declined—
the beginning of the scattering of simplicity.
With the Five Emperors, there arose benevolence and righteousness.
With the rise of the Three Kings, wisdom and cleverness emerged.
With the Five Hegemons, great falsity arose.
This continues the purport of the preceding chapter.
The sovereign’s Dao, the emperor’s virtue, the king’s wisdom, the hegemon’s falsity—
as the world’s virtue declined further and grew ever more shallow,
loyalty and filial piety became manifest.
Was this not the inevitable flow of Heaven’s course?
Alas! From the profound antiquity onward, I cannot examine it.
In the age of Emperor Yao,
every household was worthy of enfeoffment—
who were the loyal ministers, who the filial sons?
Yet when Great Shun was unfortunate enough to have a blind father, Gu Sou,
and a haughty brother, Xiang,
who plotted daily to kill him—
whether digging a well or repairing a granary—
Shun’s heart remained set on bringing Gu Sou to joy and resolving their enmity.
Only through the difficulty of a stubborn father and haughty brother
is Great Shun’s filial compassion revealed.
Had Jie not been cruel and oppressive, Longfeng would not have been killed.
Had Zhou not been lewd and disorderly, Bigan would not have died remonstrating—
how else would the loyalty of these ministers be seen?
Thus when kinship is harmonious, the name of filial piety is hidden,
yet filial piety is never absent.
When the world is well-governed, the name of loyalty is obscured,
yet loyalty is never absent.
Alas! When loyalty and filial piety shine forth in the world,
benevolence and righteousness are lost and deceit arises—
how far this is from the sovereign’s wind!

The *Classic* states:
Abandon sageliness and discard wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold.
Abandon benevolence and discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and compassion.
Abandon skill and discard profit, and there will be no thieves or robbers.
These three, as teachings, are insufficient—
thus let them have something to which to belong:
Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity,
reduce selfishness, diminish desires.

*The Original Purport* states:
Sageliness, wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness are the great roots of the world—
how can they be abandoned?
This continues the purport of the preceding chapter.
The people’s benefit, filial piety, and compassion—
from these arise thieves and robbers.
If they knew that ornamentation could be stripped away and simplicity restored,
then all who feign sageliness to startle the foolish,
wield benevolence and righteousness to brandish weapons,
or employ skill and profit to incite thieves—
these would be abandoned.
Let the people dwell securely, and the land’s benefits will increase a hundredfold.
Let households have enough for their needs, and the people will return to filial piety and compassion—
how could there be thieves?
In the late ages of the Three Dynasties,
the Dao no longer returned to its ancient source.
What they called the heart of sageliness, wisdom, benevolence, righteousness, skill, and profit
was nothing but the theft of the former kings’ model words,
adorned to deceive the present age—
as when Tian Cheng murdered his lord and seized the state of Qi—
was this not robbery?

Thus it is said: these three—when deemed insufficient as cultural adornments—must be made subordinate to something greater. One ought to trace back to the emperors and sovereigns of antiquity, contemplating the restoration of the ancient Way. Outwardly, manifest purity and simplicity; inwardly, embrace unadulterated sincerity. Rectify oneself above to encourage those below. Even if one cannot achieve complete selflessness and desirelessness, one should at least strive for minimal self-interest and few desires, thereby avoiding the conduct of thieves and robbers. When the people’s benefits are sufficient, filial piety and compassion may be restored.

The *Classic* states:
*"Abandon learning, and there will be no worries."*
Between "yea" and "nay," how great is the distance?
Between good and evil, what is the difference?
What people fear cannot but be feared.
Vast and boundless—how endless it seems!

The multitude bustles and rejoices,
as if feasting on the grandest sacrifice,
as if ascending the springtime terrace.
I alone remain cautious, as yet without sign,
like an infant who has not yet learned to smile,
adrift, as if with no place to return.
The multitude all have more than enough,
while I alone seem to have lost something.
What a fool’s heart I possess!
So guileless—
while the common folk are bright and clear,
I alone seem dim.
The common folk are sharp and discerning,
I alone am dull and muddled.
Vast as the sea, drifting without end,
still as if nowhere to abide.
The multitude all have their uses,
while I alone seem stubborn and coarse.
I alone differ from others,
yet I prize seeking sustenance from the Mother.

The *Original Meaning* states:
The Way of the sage is learning of inner attainment.
The way of the world is learning of external acquisition.
The sage does not pursue external acquisition, hence:
*"Abandon learning, and there will be no worries."*
Yet between "yea" and "nay," how great is the distance?
Between good and evil, what is the difference?
What people fear refers to the multitude and the common folk of later ages—
thus one cannot but fear them.
Their bustling abundance, their brightness and clarity,
all have their purposes—
how vast and boundless it remains!
Feasting on the grandest sacrifice, ascending the springtime terrace—
their external acquisitions are plain to see.
I alone remain cautious, as yet without sign,
like an infant who has not yet learned to smile,
adrift, as if with no place to return.
While the multitude all have more than enough,
I alone seem to have lost something.
What a fool’s heart I possess!
So guileless—
I alone seem dim,
I alone am dull and muddled,
vast as the sea, drifting without end,
still as if nowhere to abide.
While the multitude all have their uses,
I alone seem stubborn and coarse.
I alone differ from others,
yet I prize seeking sustenance from the Mother.
The Mother is the Dao.
What is sought lies within oneself—
is this not inner attainment?
Attaining what is inherently one’s own,
one no longer pursues external acquisition.
Worldly learning may be abandoned,
and I shall have no worries.

*Original Meaning of the Mysterious Classic of the Dao and Virtue*, Scroll Two
Commentary by the Teaching Gate’s Eminent Scholar, Du Daojian of Dangtu

The *Classic* states:
The bearing of great virtue follows only the Dao.
As for the Dao as a thing—
it is only dim, only vague.
Vague yet dim, within it there are images.
Dim yet vague, within it there are things.
Deep and obscure, within it there is essence.
Its essence is utterly real,
within it there is sincerity.
From ancient times to the present,
its name has never departed,
by which we observe the origins of the myriad beings.
How do I know the origins of the myriad beings are thus?
By this.

The *Original Meaning* states:
"Great" means vast. "Virtue" means attainment. Attainment within one’s heart is called virtue. "Bearing" means capacity. Possessing great virtue, one’s cosmic capacity becomes boundless—following only the Dao, nothing is not encompassed. Thus the origins of the myriad beings may be observed.
Yet what is the Dao as a thing like?
It is only dim, only vague.
Vague yet dim, within it there are images—seemingly absent yet present.
Dim yet vague, within it there are things—seemingly present yet absent.
Deep and obscure, within it there is essence—what is attained within one’s heart.
Its essence is utterly real—what one inherently possesses.
Within it there is sincerity—truly existing within oneself.
From ancient times to the present, its name has never departed,
for it has existed since before heaven and earth, since ancient times.
What we forcibly name the Dao remains the same today as of old.
The greatness of heaven and earth, the multitude of the myriad beings—
by this, all are complete within me.
How then do I know the origins of the myriad beings are thus?
By observing with what my heart has itself attained—this is how it may be known.

The *Classic* states:
Bent, then whole; crooked, then straight;
hollow, then full; worn, then new;
little, then attained; much, then confused.
Thus the sage embraces the One,
serving as the model for all under heaven.
Not self-displaying, therefore luminous.
Not self-asserting, therefore illustrious.
Not self-boasting, therefore meritorious.
Not self-aggrandizing, therefore enduring.
It is only by not contending
that none under heaven can contend with him.
The saying of old, "Bent, then whole"—how could it be empty words?
Truly whole, one returns to it.

The *Original Meaning* states:
Being bent can embody sincerity—sincere, then whole.
What the sage embraces as the One, serving as the model for all under heaven, is sincerity.
Sincerely guarding what is crooked, in time it will straighten itself.
Sincerely guarding what is hollow, in time it will fill itself.
Sincerely guarding what is worn, in time it will renew itself.
Sincerely guarding what is little, in time it will attain itself.
If even slightly insincere, taking much as attainment—this is confusion.
Confused, one does not attain.
Thus the sage does not self-display, therefore luminous.
Does not self-assert, therefore illustrious.
Does not self-boast, therefore meritorious.
Does not self-aggrandize, therefore enduring.
Only by guarding the preceding six
can the latter four avoid contending with things.
Thus none under heaven can provoke contention.
The saying of old, "Bent, then whole"—how could it be empty words?
Embracing my own Oneness to serve as the model for all under heaven—
then truly whole, one returns to it.

The *Classic* states:
Sparse words are natural.
Whirlwinds do not last the morning;
torrential rains do not last the day.
What causes these? Heaven and earth.
If even heaven and earth cannot endure,
how much less can man?
Therefore, those who engage with the Dao:
those of the Dao are one with the Dao,
those of virtue are one with virtue,
those of loss are one with loss.
One with the Dao, the Dao also attains them.
One with virtue, virtue also attains them.
One with loss, loss also attains them.
Where sincerity is insufficient, there is disbelief.

The *Original Meaning* states:
Sparse words are natural—words of non-words, actions of non-action,
the Dao of utmost sincerity without ceasing.
If one takes words as action, as intention—then sincerity is insufficient, and there is disbelief.
Sincerity ceases.
This chapter, following the preceding chapter’s theme of sincere wholeness, elucidates it further.
The attainment or loss of the Dao depends on the division between sincerity and insincerity.
Sincere, then attained; insincere, then lost.
Whirlwinds and torrential rains harm the myriad beings,
inevitably causing collapse—unable to last even a morning or evening,
self-incapable of endurance—this is not the Dao of utmost sincerity.
What then causes these? Heaven and earth.
If even heaven and earth’s whirlwinds and torrential rains cannot endure,
how much less can man?
If a state has harsh governance and oppressive decrees,
harming the hundred clans and inevitably leading to exhaustion—
this too will be unable to endure.
Is this the Dao of utmost sincerity? No.
Sincere, then one does not act with harshness or oppression.
Thus those under heaven who engage with the Dao
follow only what is above.
If above follows the Dao, below is one with the Dao.
If above follows virtue, below is one with virtue.
If above follows loss, below is one with loss.
Thus one with the Dao, the Dao also attains them.
One with virtue, virtue also attains them.
One with loss, loss also attains them.
Where sincerity is insufficient, there is disbelief—can one not be cautious in this?
Observe the *Doctrine of the Mean*: "Bent, then sincere; sincere, then formed;
formed, then manifest; manifest, then luminous; luminous, then moving;
moving, then transforming; transforming, then transforming others."
Only the utmost sincerity under heaven can transform.
From the bent and sincere, through six transformations, then comes transformation—
this is not easily altered.
When the noble person occupies office, wields governance, and transforms all under heaven,
how can the Dao of utmost sincerity be allowed to cease?

The *Classic* states:
One who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firm;
one who strides cannot walk.
One who self-displays is not luminous;
one who self-asserts is not illustrious;
one who self-boasts has no merit;
one who self-aggrandizes does not endure.
In the Dao, these are called
"leftover food and parasitic conduct."
Things may detest them—
thus those with the Dao do not dwell in them.

The *Original Meaning* states:
One who overreaches cannot stand firm.
The path of officialdom in the worldly realm—
though seemingly unrelated, they are never truly unrelated.
People chase after fame and position,
and with the slightest impetuous heart,
they fall into the realm where the Dao is unseen.
From a lowly position, things are placed far away—
the heart desires hasty attainment,
straining upward in pursuit.
Not only can things not be obtained,
but even one’s feet cannot stand firm.

「跨者不行。 To stride too boldly is to fail in action.

欲速进而大跨，未有能行者矣。
One who seeks swift advancement yet overreaches—
there has never been one who could succeed.

盖由心不知道，物欲所牵，过望功名，
This is because the heart does not grasp the Dao,
dragged by the cravings of things,
excessively coveting fame and position,

曾不知分彼心，必有不容自己之惑，
yet unaware of the limits of the heart,
it must harbor afflictions that cannot be contained.

不颠厌不已也，
Ever restless, never sated—
oh, how pitiful!

故曰：自见者不明，自是者不彰，自伐者无功，自矜者不长。
Thus it is said:
One who self-displays is not luminous;
one who self-asserts is not illustrious;
one who self-boasts has no merit;
one who self-aggrandizes does not endure.

其六者之在道也，
These six transgressions, in the Dao,
譬犹残余之食，赘洗之行，
are like leftover scraps of food and parasitic habits—
物或恶之，故有道者不处。
things may detest them—
thus those who follow the Dao do not dwell in them.

《经》曰：有物混成，先天地生。
The *Classic* states:
There is a thing of undifferentiated unity,
born before Heaven and Earth.

寂兮寥兮，
Silent and vast—
独立而不政，
it stands alone yet does not rule,
周行而不殆，
it circulates universally yet is never exhausted.
可以为天下母。
It may be called the Mother of all under Heaven.

吾不知其名，字之曰道。
I do not know its name,
so I call it the Dao.

强为之名曰大。
For want of a better term, I name it *Great*.

大曰逝，
The Great is called *Passing*—
逝曰远，
*Passing* is called *Distant*—
远曰返。
*Distant* is called *Returning*.

故道大，天大，地大，王亦大。
Thus the Dao is Great,
Heaven is Great,
Earth is Great,
and the King is also Great.

域中有四大，而王居其一焉。
Within the realm of the Great,
there are four Greatnesses,
and the King holds one among them.

人法地，地法天，天法道，道法自然。
Humans model themselves after Earth,
Earth models itself after Heaven,
Heaven models itself after the Dao,
and the Dao models itself after *Naturalness*.

《原旨》曰：有物混成，先天地生。
The *Original Meaning* states:
There is a thing of undifferentiated unity,
born before Heaven and Earth.

天地之先，无物也。
Before Heaven and Earth,
there was nothing.

而曰有物混成，
Yet it is said there was a thing of undifferentiated unity—
是何物耶。
what thing was this?

天地之先，有五太。
Before Heaven and Earth,
there were the Five *Supremes*.

列子止言太易、太初、太始、太素，
The *Liezi* speaks only of *Supreme Facile*,
*Supreme Primordial*,
*Supreme Beginning*,
and *Supreme Substance*,
而不言太极。
but does not mention *Supreme Polarity*.

又言气形质具，而未相离。
It also says:
*Qi* takes form and substance,
yet they are not yet distinct.

故曰浑沦。
Thus it is called *Undifferentiated*.

浑沦者，言万物浑沦而未相离也，
*Undifferentiated*—
speaking of all things in undifferentiated unity,
非太极乎。
is it not the *Supreme Polarity*?

夫列子得之发明及此，
Now, the *Liezi* expounds upon this,
是知有物混成非物也，
knowing that the "thing of undifferentiated unity"
is not a thing at all,
指万物相浑沦者而言也。
but refers to all things in their state of undifferentiated unity.

吾尝曰：未有吾身，先有天地。
I have said:
Before my body existed,
Heaven and Earth already were.

未有天地，先有吾心。
Before Heaven and Earth existed,
my heart already was.

吾心此道也，
My heart is this Dao—
岂惟吾哉。
not just my own.

人莫不有是心，
All people possess this heart,
心莫不有是道，
and all hearts possess this Dao.
知此谓之知道，
To know this is to know the Dao,
得此谓之得道。
to attain this is to attain the Dao.

然则道何自而知，何从而得哉。
Yet how does one come to know the Dao,
and from where does one attain it?

吾将欲言，而忘其所欲言也。
I would speak of it,
yet I forget what I wished to say.

余尝於酒扫之暇，隐几神进，
In my leisure moments,
after drinking and sweeping,
I sit quietly and concentrate my spirit,
适仰先天混成之道，
to contemplate the Dao of undifferentiated unity before Heaven and Earth—
寂寥无朕独立周行，
silent and vast, with no trace,
it stands alone yet circulates universally.
化化生生，
It transforms and gives birth to transformations,
今古不忒，
from ancient times to now, it is never erring.
是宜可为天下母也。
It is fitting to call it the Mother of all under Heaven.

老圣谦辞，谓吾不知其名，字之曰道，
The venerable sage humbly says,
"I do not know its name,
so I call it the Dao."

强为之名曰大。
For want of a better term, I name it *Great*.

此一节摹写道妙若可即席而励奋语。
This passage vividly depicts the Dao’s subtlety,
as though one could be inspired and roused
while seated right before them.

首章言无名天地之始，
The opening chapter speaks of the nameless beginning of Heaven and Earth,
演至此而漏泄春风，
and now, in unfolding this,
it reveals the vitality of the Dao—
有不容閟者矣。
there is no way to conceal it.

大曰逝，
The Great is called *Passing*—
逝，往也。
*Passing* means *to go*.

逝曰远，
*Passing* is called *Distant*—
远而无所至极也。
*Distant* yet without any ultimate destination.

远曰返，
*Distant* is called *Returning*—
返，复也。
*Returning* means *to return*.

复则可以见天地之心矣。
To return is to perceive the heart of Heaven and Earth.

此道之盈虚消息，
This is the Dao’s waxing and waning,
如环无端。
like a circle with no beginning or end.

先乎天地，莫知其始。
Before Heaven and Earth,
no one knows its origin.

后乎天地，莫见其终。
After Heaven and Earth,
no one sees its conclusion.

故以道观天地，则见道大。
Thus, when observing Heaven and Earth through the Dao,
one sees the Dao’s Greatness.

以天地观帝王，则见天地大。
When observing emperors through Heaven and Earth,
one sees the Greatness of Heaven and Earth.

以帝王观人民，则见帝王大。
When observing the people through emperors,
one sees the Greatness of emperors.

虽然究其端倪，四者之大，莫不均囿大虚之域法则也。
Though they differ in appearance,
the Greatness of these four—
the Dao, Heaven, Earth, and the King—
all conform to the principles of the boundless void.

人能仰观俯察，近取远求，
If humans can gaze upward and downward,
draw near and reach far,
由地而知天，
from Earth, they can know Heaven,
知道，
and from the Dao, they can know Naturalness,
知自然，
taking this as their model—
取以为法，
内而正心诚意，
within, they rectify their hearts and make their intentions sincere,
外而修齐治平，
without, they cultivate harmony and bring peace,
以至功成身退，入圣超凡，
until their deeds are accomplished and they withdraw,
ascending to sainthood and transcending the mundane,
投身不殆，
their bodies never faltering—
是则可与此道伺久也，已噫焉。
then they may dwell with this Dao for long.
Ah, how noble!

得知自然者，而与之言哉。
Only those who know *Naturalness*
can speak of it with them.

惟知自然者，则可与言道也。
Only those who know *Naturalness*
can speak of the Dao with them.

王亦大，一作人，
The King is also Great—
one variant reads *humans*—
言王则人在焉。
but when it speaks of the King,
it implies humans are present.

今从王，
I follow the reading of *King* here,
尊君也。
to honor the ruler.

《经》曰：重为轻根，静为躁君。
The *Classic* states:
*Weightiness* is the root of *lightness*,
and *stillness* is the sovereign of *restlessness*.

是以君子终曰行，不离辎重。
Thus the virtuous one always says,
"I will go,"
yet never leaves their *burden*—
虽有荣观，
though there may be splendor and grandeur,
燕处超然。
they dwell in rest with an effortless transcendence.

奈何万乘之主，而以身轻天下。
Yet how can a ruler of ten thousand chariots
make their body *light* to the world?
轻则失臣，
*Lightness* leads to losing their ministers,
躁则失君。
and *restlessness* leads to losing their sovereignty.

《原旨》曰：天下之理，重能制轻，静能制躁，
The *Original Meaning* states:
In the principles of the world,
*weightiness* can govern *lightness*,
and *stillness* can govern *restlessness*—
自然之道也。
this is the Dao of Naturalness.

曰重，曰静，根本也。
*Weightiness* and *stillness*
are the roots and foundations—
君主也。
the rulers.

曰轻，曰躁，枝叶也。
*Lightness* and *restlessness*
are the branches and leaves—
臣民也。
the ministers and people.

根者重则枝叶茂，
When the roots are *weighty*,
the branches and leaves flourish.
君者静则臣民安，
When the ruler is *still*,
the ministers and people are at ease.

吾计其天下之必归往，
I calculate that the world
must inevitably return to this—
四海之必清平矣。
and that the four seas will inevitably become serene and peaceful.

是以君子终曰行不离辎重，
Thus the virtuous one always says,
"I will go,"
yet never leaves their *burden*—
虽有荣观，
though there may be splendor and grandeur,
燕处超然，
they dwell in rest with an effortless transcendence—
君子士之知道者也。
this is the Dao of the virtuous scholar.

惟君子而知此道，
Only the virtuous scholar knows this Dao,
故行不离辎重，
thus they go yet never leave their *burden*,
燕处则超然，
and dwell in rest with an effortless transcendence—
见其行不失重，
it is seen that their going does not lose *weightiness*,
居不失静也。
and their dwelling does not lose *stillness*.

奈何万乘而以身轻天下，
Yet how can a ruler of ten thousand chariots
make their body *light* to the world?
叹三代之昏主，
Alas for the rulers of the Three Dynasties—
反有不如君子之知道，
they even failed to match the Dao of the virtuous scholar,
而能守重静者也。
yet could not uphold *weightiness* and *stillness*.

若桀、纣可谓身轻天下者矣。
Like Jie and Zhou,
they may be called those who made their bodies *light* to the world.

伊尹五就而不能用，
Yi Yin five times approached them,
yet they could not employ him;
微子抱祭器而归周，
Wei Zi carried the sacrificial vessels and returned to the Zhou—
轻则失臣也。
*lightness* leads to losing their ministers.

禹、汤建久长之业，
Yu and Tang established enduring and long-lasting achievements,
卒以其昏主暴虐而亡，
yet ultimately perished
because of their foolish rulers’ cruelty and tyranny—
躁则失君也。
*restlessness* leads to losing their sovereignty.

有国有家者，可不戒哉。
Rulers who possess states and families—
can they not be warned?

《经》曰：善行，无辙迹。
The *Classic* states:
Good conduct leaves no tracks or traces;
善言，无瑕谪。
good speech has no flaws or defects;
善计，不用筹策。
good planning does not require calculations or strategies;
善闭，无关键而不可开。」
good closure requires no locks or keys,
yet cannot be opened.

「Good binding, though lacking cords or knots, cannot be undone.
Thus, the Sage always excels in saving others,
so there are none abandoned.
Always excels in saving things,
so there are none discarded.
This is called *embracing clarity*.

Therefore, the virtuous person is the teacher of the unvirtuous,
while the unvirtuous serve as the resources of the virtuous.
To not hold one’s teacher in high regard,
nor cherish one’s resources,
though seemingly great confusion—
this is called *the essential mystery*.

*The Original Meaning* states:
There is the kind of goodness with *compassionate gentleness*,
and the kind with *utter appropriateness*.
If one attains the goodness of *utter appropriateness*,
then there is nothing it does not fit,
nothing it does not perfect.
Good conduct, good speech, good planning, good closure, good binding—
those aligned with the Dao all reside in *utter appropriateness*.
Without tracks or traces,
without flaws or defects,
without calculations or strategies,
without locks or keys yet unopenable,
without cords or knots yet unbreakable—
in things, this means there are no gaps for scrutiny.

Thus, the Sage saves people and things,
always through *my* goodness,
so there is no abandonment of people or things.
This is called *embracing clarity*.
*Embracing clarity* means
acting in what is most fitting,
yet never doing what is unfitting.

Therefore, the virtuous person
can be the teacher of the unvirtuous.
The unvirtuous
can be the resources of the virtuous.
Teachers originally exist to guide others with goodness.
If one teaches others, then one’s own heart is not held in high regard.
Thus,
Mencius said: *"Capital is for using people well."*
If one uses people as resources,
then one’s own heart loses affection.
Thus, the noble one does not harm others through what sustains them,
and so does not hold their teachers in high regard,
nor cherish their resources.
One does not regard others’ teachers as noble,
nor others’ resources as beloved.
From the perspective of the world,
though it may seem like great confusion—
from the perspective of the Dao,
this is called *the essential mystery*.

The *Classic* states:
Know the *heroic* yet hold to the *receptive*,
and you become the valley of the world.
As the valley of the world,
your virtue never departs,
returning to the *infant*.
Know the *white* yet hold to the *black*,
and you become the model of the world.
As the model of the world,
your virtue does not overreach,
returning to the *Non-Extreme*.
Know the *honored* yet hold to the *humiliated*,
and you become the basin of the world.
As the basin of the world,
your virtue is complete,
returning to the *Uncarved*.
The *Uncarved* disperses into things below—
the Sage uses it,
and it becomes officials and leaders,
thus great governance does not harm.

*The Original Meaning* states:
The *infant*—the marvelous form of *my* body.
The *Non-Extreme*—the marvelous form of heaven, earth, and all things.
The *Uncarved*—the marvelous form of the Dao.
Knowing the marvelous form of *my* body,
one holds to the *receptive* without the heart of contending for the *heroic*,
thus able to be the valley of the world.
As the valley of the world—
a metaphor for the sea.
The sea contains all things,
revealing that one’s constant virtue never departs
from the marvelous form of *my* body,
returning to the *infant*.

Knowing the marvelous form of heaven, earth, and all things,
one holds to the *black* without the heart of flaunting the *white*,
thus able to be the model of the world.
As the model of the world—
a metaphor for *embracing unity*.
Unity can gather all things,
revealing that one’s constant virtue does not overreach
the marvelous form of heaven, earth, and all things,
returning to the *Non-Extreme*.

Knowing the marvelous form of the Dao,
one holds to the *humiliated* without the heart of coveting the *honored*.
To hold to the *humiliated*—
to hold to the lowly.
Thus able to be the basin of the world.
As the basin of the world—
a metaphor for deep, bottomless valleys.
When the first *yang* stirs,
the root of primordial *qi* lies therein.
This is where one’s constant virtue is complete
in the marvelous form of the Dao,
returning to the *Uncarved*.
The *Uncarved* disperses into things below—
the divine vessels of the world.
When the Sage uses them,
they become officials and leaders,
thus able to govern the world greatly,
without causing harm or injury.

The *Classic* states:
*"Those who would take the world and act upon it—
I see that they will not succeed.
The divine vessels of the world cannot be seized.
To act upon them is to ruin them;
to grasp them is to lose them.
Thus, things sometimes move or follow,
sometimes warm or cool,
sometimes strong or weak,
sometimes bear or collapse.
Therefore, the Sage avoids excess,
avoids extravagance,
avoids extravagance."*

*The Original Meaning* states:
The Sage sits in the precious position and leads the world,
like the great sea controlling all rivers,
listening as they flow toward their tributaries.
If one harbors the intent to take,
then the rivers dry up,
and those flowing toward tributaries cease—
the sea’s exhaustion awaits.
To sit in the precious position yet harbor the intent to take the world,
and to amass—
is this not like the sea drying up rivers
and cutting off their flow toward tributaries?
I see that they will not succeed is clear.

The divine vessels of the world—
the precious position of emperors and kings.
Life depends on it.
It cannot be achieved by cleverness,
nor seized by force.
To act upon it is to ruin it;
to grasp it is to lose it.
Thus, things sometimes move or follow,
sometimes warm or cool,
sometimes strong or weak,
sometimes bear or collapse.
The *things* referred to—
the divine vessels mentioned earlier—
are what the world relies upon,
and cannot be treated as one’s own possessions.
*Following* means migration.
*Warming/cooling* means praise and blame.
*Strong/weak* means prosperity and decline.
*Bearing/collapsing* means safety and peril.
The *sometimes* reflects
that the Way has no constancy,
and the people are to be feared.
Thus, the Sage knows
that safety must have peril,
and avoids excess.
Knows that prosperity must have decline,
and avoids extravagance.
Knows that praise must have blame,
and avoids extravagance.

The *Classic* states:
*"Those who assist rulers with the Dao
do not use force to dominate the world.
Their affairs return naturally—
where the army passes, thorns and brambles grow.
After great armies, there are years of famine.
Thus, the virtuous achieve only what is fitting,
daring not to take by force."*

「Thus, the fruits of action must be reaped without arrogance,
without boasting,
without pride,
and only when unavoidable—
this is the way of reaping fruits without force.

When things reach their peak, they grow old—
this is called *not* the Dao.
Not the Dao means early ruin.

*The Original Meaning* states:
Chapter A: When rulers possess the world,
it is because they have the land.
With the land, there are ancestral altars.
With ancestral altars, there are the people.
The ancestral altars and the people—
these are the sacred tools of the world.
The previous chapter admonished rulers with the Dao,
this chapter warns ministers against using arms.
Ah! The wisdom of the ancient Sage is profound indeed.
Even to not aspire to the world—
this is why he stands as a teacher for a hundred generations.

The Dao of Heaven favors life and abhors killing,
filling the abundant and nourishing the modest,
valuing gentleness and not favoring harshness.
Gentleness brings life,
harshness brings death—
this is the inevitable course of nature.

Thus, the virtuous act only when unavoidable.
When the people of the world are led by the Dao,
the ministers should assist the ruler,
protect the ancestral altars,
and ensure the people’s safety.
If they instead use arms to dominate the world,
they overturn the ancestral altars,
poison the people—
this is even worse.
Moreover, arms have no constant victor,
their consequences return naturally,
and defeat follows swiftly—
how can one not be warned?

If ministers cannot assist their ruler with the Dao,
but instead indulge in reckless warfare,
boast of martial prowess,
and scheme for glory within the state,
then they waste their people through battle.
The people cannot endure,
and if they do not die in war,
they flee and abandon the land.
The calamities of arms are such across the world.
Where the army marches,
plowing and weeding cease,
and thorns and brambles grow.
A hundred *li* of war brings harm to a hundred *li*.
A thousand *li* of war brings harm to a thousand *li*.
After great armies are raised,
without waiting for floods or droughts,
the years become calamitous.
Is this the Dao of a virtuous minister?

The virtuous achieve only what is fitting,
daring not to take by force—
thus, they should carefully examine what they take.

Observe Confucius, when answering Duke Ling’s inquiry about warfare at a sacrificial feast,
and you will know that arms are not to be spoken of lightly.
When answering Zigong’s question about governance,
you will know that arms can be abandoned.
Alas! The Sage Confucius’ concern for the world—
how is it different from the ancient Sage’s?

To reap fruits without arrogance,
without boasting,
without pride,
and only when unavoidable—
this means that when natural reason dictates,
as in what I have spoken,
one must know that it is unavoidable
and proceed accordingly—
only then does one embody the Dao of reaping without force.

When things reach their peak, they grow old—
if ministers, at the height of their power,
do not know when to retreat,
but instead engage in military posturing and political games,
then danger is near.
This is called *not* knowing the Dao,
and not the Dao means early ruin—
how much more so when bows are stored and dogs are slaughtered,
only hastening their own downfall!

How then can they hope to assist the ruler,
bring order to the state,
and achieve peace in the world?
Those who hear this should take heed.

*The Classic* states:
*"Fine arms are ominous instruments,
which things often detest,
so those who follow the Dao do not wield them.
The virtuous should honor the left in peace,
but honor the right in war.
Arms are ominous instruments,
not the tools of the virtuous,
used only when unavoidable.
Serenity and simplicity are supreme.
Victory should not be gloried in—
to glory in it is to delight in killing.
Those who delight in killing cannot aspire to rule the world.
Auspicious matters favor the left,
ominous matters favor the right.
The lesser general is placed on the left,
the supreme general on the right—
this is to liken them to funeral rites.
When many are killed,
they should be mourned with sorrowful tears.
Victory should be treated as funeral rites."*

*The Original Meaning* says:
*"Bows and arrows have long threatened the world,
and yet the world has always had those who steal them
to defy the Son of Heaven—
this has been so since ancient times.
How can arms not be treated with caution?
Arms are instruments of killing.
Yet they are called 'fine arms'—
there must be those who delight in killing.
Ominous instruments are instruments of harm.
Earlier, they were called sacred tools,
now they are called instruments of harm—
sometimes revered as sacred,
sometimes reviled as ominous—
how can one possess the world
while allowing such conflicting hearts to arise?
Thus, those who follow the Dao do not wield them.
This follows the remaining meaning of the previous chapter,
warning ministers who love to use arms.*

When the world is at peace,
the virtuous in office should value the left.
But when war arises,
they should value the right.
Arms are ominous instruments,
not the tools of the virtuous,
used only when unavoidable.
They should always uphold serenity and simplicity as supreme.

Serenity and simplicity—
the ruler’s teacher seeks to nurture the people,
not to revel in captives and deceit,
nor to harbor treacherous intentions.
Thus, though they may win,
they do not take pride in it.
If they do take pride,
it is because they delight in killing.
Those who delight in killing cannot aspire to rule the world.

Like the Duke of Chu’s Ziyou at Chengpu,
or Jin’s Xianguo at Ji,
all those who wield arms and love war
ultimately cannot achieve their ambitions.

Mencius told King Xiang of Liang:
*"Those who do not delight in killing can unite the world.
Again he said:
The world has no one who does not seek harmony,
how can one who delights in killing
aspire to rule the world?"*

The left is the honored position,
the right is the lowly position.
Auspicious matters favor the left—
this is joyful.
Ominous matters favor the right—
this is sorrowful.
The lesser general is placed on the left,
for he does not bear sole responsibility for killing,
and thus is given an honored position.
The supreme general is placed on the right,
for he holds the power of life and death,
and thus is given a lowly position.
This clearly shows that ominous matters should not be honored.

Alas! When receiving orders from the general,
the general commands the army,
and the ruler’s orders may not always be obeyed.
At such times, how should the ruler’s heart be?
It is perilous.
Thus, the lesser general is placed on the left,
to show the need for caution,
while the supreme general is placed on the right,
to bear the ominous name of war.»

The **Dao** is ever nameless.
The **uncarved block**—though small—
the world dare not enslave.
If lords and kings could guard it well,
all things would come as guests.

Heaven and Earth unite,
and sweet dew descends.
No command from Heaven,
yet all is balanced.
At first, the **Dao** was nameless,
but when names were given,
Heaven knew to halt.
To know when to stop
is how one avoids ruin.

Like the **Dao** in the world,
it is akin to streams and valleys
with the great rivers and seas.

The *Original Meaning* says:
The **Dao** is ever nameless—
nameless, hence honored.
The **uncarved block** has no form—
no form, hence vast.
Only by not dwelling in what is honored and vast
does it remain small yet unassailable by the world.
If lords and kings could embody
this nameless honor and formless greatness,
guard it without loss,
they would not need to proclaim their virtue to all under Heaven—
yet the multitude of people and things
would naturally submit.

For lords and kings to the people,
as Heaven and Earth to all things,
this response and that reaction
are governed by one principle.

Observe Heaven and Earth’s weaving and binding,
the union of yin and yang,
and sweet dew descends—
nothing but the **harmony of balance** at work.

That which is balanced without command
shows how all things first divided,
their **spirit-essence and vital qi** allotted,
their beginnings and growth
requiring not a hair’s breadth of human effort.

From the **Dao**’s nameless origin
to the giving of names,
each thing follows its own principle.
Once names are given,
when deeds are done and matters settled,
Heaven knows to halt—
the **Dao** of withdrawal.

The ancients who grasped this
were exalted as emperors or kings.
Those who do not know the **Dao**,
the **Way** is long past—
how much more so
when bows are stored and dogs are boiled,
only hastening their own downfall?

How then could they hope
to aid the sovereign’s rule,
govern the state in order,
and bring peace to the world?
Hearers of this should take warning.

The *Scripture* says:
**"Excellent weapons are not auspicious instruments**—
things may detest them,
so those who follow the **Dao** do not dwell upon them.
The gentleman in peace values the left,
in war values the right.

Weapons are not auspicious instruments,
not the tools of the gentleman,
used only when there is no other choice.
Calm and unassuming is the highest virtue,
to conquer yet not take pleasure in it.

But those who take pleasure in it
delight in killing people.
Those who delight in killing people
cannot hope to prevail in the world.

Auspicious matters favor the left—
this is joyful.
Ominous matters favor the right—
this is sorrowful.
The lesser general is placed on the left,
for he does not bear sole responsibility for killing,
and thus is given an honored position.
The supreme general is placed on the right,
for he holds the power of life and death,
and thus is given a lowly position.
This clearly shows that ominous matters should not be honored.

Alas! When receiving orders from the general,
the general commands the army,
and the ruler’s orders may not always be obeyed.
At such times, how should the ruler’s heart be?
It is perilous.
Thus, the lesser general is placed on the left,
to show the need for caution,
while the supreme general is placed on the right,
to bear the ominous name of war.

The *Scripture* says:
Weapons are treated with funeral rites—
the ominous nature is evident.
When many are slain,
it is mourned with sorrowful weeping.
When victory is won,
it is treated with funeral rites—
is this not something one should endure with reluctance?

If not an enemy state invading us,
yet unrest lingers below,
and one must use force,
it should not be raised lightly.

The ancient kings had a heart
that could not bear to harm others—
thus they governed with a policy
that could not bear to harm others.

The *Scripture* says:
The **Dao** is ever nameless.
The **uncarved block**—though small—
the world dare not enslave.
If lords and kings could guard it well,
all things would come as guests.

Heaven and Earth unite,
and sweet dew descends.
No command from Heaven,
yet all is balanced.
At first, the **Dao** was nameless,
but when names were given,
Heaven knew to halt.
To know when to stop
is how one avoids ruin."

The **Dao** in the world is like rivers and valleys to the seas.

*The Original Meaning* says:
The **Dao** is ever nameless—
nameless, hence revered.
The **uncarved block** has no form—
no form, hence vast.
Though it does not dwell in reverence or vastness,
it is small yet none dare enslave it.
If lords and kings could embody this nameless reverence,
this formless vastness,
and guard it without loss,
they would not need to proclaim their virtue to all under heaven—
yet the multitude of people and things would submit as guests.

For lords and kings to the people,
as Heaven and Earth to all things,
this response and that reaction—
they share the same principle.
Observe how Heaven and Earth, in their interplay,
with yin and yang united,
descend sweet dew—
all arising from the **harmony of balance**.
None commands it, yet all is equal.
At first, the **Dao** was nameless,
but when names were given,
one thing, one principle—
names given, deeds accomplished,
Heaven knows when to halt—
the **Way of withdrawal**.

The ancients who grasped this
were **Emperors above** and **Kings below**—
Fuxi and King Wen.
Fuxi attained it as **Emperor**,
drawing the six primordial strokes,
with **Heaven** to the south and **Earth** to the north,
fixing their positions,
and first giving names—
thus the **Emperor’s Way** flourished.
When King Wen attained it as **King**,
the **Dao** was fully realized—
names had been given.
He then composed the eight trigrams of **Later Heaven**,
with **Heaven** withdrawing to the northwest,
**Earth** to the southwest—
Heaven knew when to halt.
To know when to halt
is how one avoids ruin.
Withdrawing at the right time—
what danger could there be?
The **Emperor-King’s** spirit is thus revealed.

The Sage gathers the essence of Heaven and Earth,
clarifying the **uncarved block**,
and for those who would be lords and kings,
explains it in parables and mysteries—
the principles are now fully laid out.
Yet fearing later ages might not grasp its meaning,
he speaks again in closer terms:
*"The **Dao** in the world is like rivers and valleys to the seas."*

This elucidates what was seen earlier:
*"The heroic, about to take the world."*

*The Scripture* says:
He who knows others is wise,
he who knows himself is enlightened.
He who overcomes others has strength,
he who overcomes himself is powerful.
He who knows contentment is rich,
he who perseveres has resolve.
He who does not lose his place endures,
he who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.

*The Original Meaning* says:
Life and death are great matters indeed.
Examined closely,
when one is manifest, they are human;
when hidden, they are spirits and gods.
Manifest, they return to humanity—
no ancient or modern, no wise or foolish—
all the same.
Yet in life,
prosperity and adversity, gain and loss,
cycle like clouds—
emotions shift with circumstances,
as one bows and rises through an age,
like the Creator’s alternating dark and bright,
expanding and contracting—
ever-changing, a myriad forms in a day.
Without the **Dao** to guide them,
who would not stumble and fall?

Thus one must first know self and others,
then can fully respond to the world and engage with things—
the **Way of humanity**,
the **Way of knowing life and death**.

He who knows others is wise,
he who knows himself is enlightened.
By "know," I do not mean knowing their clans or kin,
their achievements or deeds—
only their hearts.
To know another’s heart,
what task could not be accomplished with wisdom?
To know one’s own heart,
what action could not be measured with clarity?

He who overcomes others has strength—
for desire burns fiercely in them.
He who overcomes himself is powerful—
for Heaven’s principle is clear.
He who knows contentment is rich—
for his inner substance is full.
He who perseveres has resolve—
for his body is strong and healthy.
He who does not lose his place endures—
for he abides in the **Middle Way**.
He who dies yet does not perish is long-lived—
for his essence returns whole.

Mortals, in their rise and fall,
their lifespan fixed by transformation,
do not merely possess enduring virtue or great deeds
to prolong this age—
but those who are manifest as human,
hidden as spirits and gods,
seem to vanish yet endure,
unseen yet divine—
truly, the unperishing exists.

*The Scripture* says:
The **Great Dao** flows—
it can be neither grasped nor resisted.
All things rely on it to live,
yet it does not claim credit.
It accomplishes without naming itself.
It nurtures all things yet does not rule—
ever without desire,
it may be called **small**.
All things return to it yet it does not rule—
it may be called **great**.
Thus the Sage never claims greatness,
and so achieves true greatness.

*The Original Meaning* says:
The Sage nurtures the people,
not boasting of achievements or virtue—
for he embodies the **Dao**.
Though the world bears him up without burden,
and he delights in spreading virtue without restraint,
though he does not desire greatness,
it is inevitable.
The **Great Dao** flows—
omnipresent, neither left nor right.
Wherever it goes,
all things rely on it to live,
yet it does not refuse.
Things live because of it—
no refusal, no gratitude.
It accomplishes without claiming credit—
what deeds remain to claim?
It nurtures all things yet does not rule—
what it should nurture, it nurtures—
how could it claim mastery?
Ever without desire,
it may be called **small**—
the ultimate in humility.
All things return to it yet it does not rule—
it may be called **great**.
With no intention to receive,
things come of their own accord.
With no intention to be great,
things grow great of their own accord.
Such is the **Dao** in its essence.
Thus the Sage takes the **Dao** as his heart,
nurtures all the people,
though his deeds and virtues are great,
he never considers himself great—
and so the world submits,
and he achieves true greatness.

I conclude this chapter,
leaning back, savoring in silence,
wandering in spirit to antiquity,
and there I see the **Emperor of Primordial Times**,
his followers like wild deer,
the **Great Uncarved** in its pure simplicity—
still vibrant, as if alive.

*The Scripture* says:
Hold fast to the **Great Symbol**—
the world will come.
Come without harm,
secure and at peace.
Joy and bait—
passengers will stop.
When the **Dao** leaves the mouth,
it is bland, without taste.
To look at it, insufficient to see;
to listen, insufficient to hear;
to use it, inexhaustible.

*The Original Essence* says:
The **Dao** is vast without bounds—
the Sage follows its pattern and embodies it,
to nurture all under Heaven.

The **Four Quarters** and **Eight Barbarians**,
all are embraced with love and nourished,
their needs met without measure—
thus the world comes to him.

When they come, they are unharmed,
settled in peace,
peace brings tranquility,
tranquility brings harmony.

The ancients who practiced this—
**Yellow Emperor** was one.
Observing the **Dao** of Heaven,
holding fast to its ways,
he ruled with ease while all under Heaven was ordered.

Yet what is this "order"?
Joy and bait—
passengers stop when they arrive.
Weapons against rebels
are like joy and bait for travelers:
when guests come, spread music and food to entertain them,
and they will stay—
then depart.

When **Chiyou**’s chaos arose, it must be punished—
weapons were raised.
When **Yandi** returned, he was pardoned—
weapons could then be laid down.

Weapons cannot always be wielded,
nor can they always be governed by ritual.
Drinking wine begins with order,
but ends in disorder.

When harmony reaches its peak,
strange delights arise—
so too with all things:
beginning with sincerity,
ending in vulgarity.
At first, it is simple,
but when complete,
it becomes excessive.
Thus, weapons—
how can one not be wary?

The **Dao** as speech,
when spoken, is bland without taste—
not like joy and bait,
but like the **Great Symbol**.

The **Symbol** has no form,
so it cannot be seen.
The **Symbol** has no sound,
so it cannot be heard.
The Sage follows and applies it—
its use is boundless.

*The Scripture* says:
To seek to nourish,
first stretch it taut.
To seek to weaken,
first strengthen it.
To seek to abandon,
first establish it.
To seek to take,
first give it—
this is called **subtle clarity**.

The soft overcomes the hard.
Fish cannot escape the deep—
a state’s sharp tools
should not be displayed to the people.

*The Original Essence* says:
Day and night alternate in brightness and obscurity,
people and things wax and wane—
the unceasing flow of antiquity and present,
for **Great Transformation** moves through the cosmos.
Some things cannot escape:
spring brings warmth, winter brings cold,
autumn brings coolness, summer brings heat—
their cycles shift without end,
the natural order.

What intent does **Transformation** have?
Thus cold and heat succeed each other,
and the year’s work is complete.
To seek to nourish,
first stretch it taut—
this is **opening and closing**.
To seek to weaken,
first strengthen it—
this is **subtraction and addition**.
To seek to abandon,
first establish it—
this is **negation and affirmation**.
To seek to take,
first give it—
this is **life and death**.
This is the **subtle yet clear** work of **Great Transformation**.

Thus the soft overcomes the hard.
Softness is the nature of **qi**.
Things change and flow.
Hardness is the nature of form.
Things grow strong and then decay.
To know change and flow,
without falling into rigidity or decay—
then victory lies within our grasp.

Fish cannot escape the deep.
Fish are the people,
the deep is the state,
water is the sharp tools.
Sharp tools are wealth and food.
When the deep holds water, fish are secure;
when the state has wealth and food, the people are secure.
Water hidden in the deep—
fish do not flee.
Wealth and food hidden in the world—
the people do not flee.

For a ruler governing a state,
can he display the means of accumulation to the people?
Knowing the flow of **Great Transformation**,
the ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness,
the fixed principles of nature—
then the mind of reckoning
will naturally have no need for excess.
How much more so when the state’s resources
are stored throughout the world,
like water drying in winter and filling in spring—
never lacking—
what need for worry?

*The Scripture* says:
The **Dao** acts without action,
yet nothing remains undone.
If lords and kings could uphold it,
all things would transform of their own accord.
If transformation begins to stir,
I will steady it with the **Unnamed Primordial**.

The **Unnamed Primordial** will also not desire—
not desiring, it remains still,
and the world will align itself.

*The Original Essence* says:
The **Dao** acts without action,
yet nothing remains undone.
The **Dao** has fixed principles:
what should be done and what should not.
Not doing what should not be done,
doing what should be done—
then spring will be spring,
summer will be summer,
yin and yang will not err,
without words, the four seasons proceed.
If things and their **Dao** reverse their nature,
disastrous **qi** arises,
the seasons lose harmony,
and things are harmed.

So too with governance.
If lords and kings embody the **Dao** of governance,
upholding what the ruler should do,
not doing what the ruler should not—
then rulers will be rulers,
ministers will be ministers,
their roles without error.
The ruler need not speak,
and all officials will be correct.
All things will transform of their own accord.

The altars and people—
none will dare overstep their place,
doing what they should,
not doing what they should not.

If imperial virtue falters,
alternative policies arise.
If the ruler fully embodies the **Dao** of rule,
and ministers fully embody the **Dao** of service,
superiors do not oppress inferiors,
inferiors do not overstep superiors—
how could anyone dare defy their will
and not conform to the **Dao**?

If transformation begins to stir,
it means that after transformation,
there is still another desire to act.
The ruler’s path must consider:
*Why does this desire to act arise?*
There must be those who provoke it.
Do not wait for them to act first—
examine what I have not yet done correctly,
return to what is correct,
and steady it with stillness.

Thus, their intentions will naturally dissipate,
their crimes exposed without need for words,
and they will transform of their own accord.
How dare they act again?

This is called:
*I will steady it with the **Unnamed Primordial**.*
The **Unnamed Primordial** will also not desire—
the ruler, ashamed of his virtue,
the people, fearful of his might—
he must also forget speech,
serene as if unaware—
this is called *not desiring*.
Not desiring, he remains still,
and the world will align itself.

The **Dao**’s action without action,
yet nothing remains undone.

If people of this age
were as inert as logs or stones,
only then could they be called "without action"—
how then could anything be done?

「This is not what I know.

From the original meaning of *Dao De Xuan Jing* (卷之二竟), and the original meaning of *Dao De Xuan Jing* (卷之三):

The Master of the Teachings, **Du Daojian** of Cangtu, annotates:

The *Classic* says:
The **virtue** of the **Way**’s highest does not cling to virtue—
thus, it has **virtue**.

The **virtue** of the **Way**’s lowest does not abandon virtue—
thus, it lacks **virtue**.

The **Way**’s highest acts without action—
yet nothing is left undone.

The **Way**’s lowest acts for action—
yet it has much to do.

The **Way**’s highest **ren** acts with intention—
yet nothing is left undone.

The **Way**’s highest **yi** acts with intention—
yet it has much to do.

The **Way**’s highest **li** acts with intention—
yet none respond in kind,
so it forces arms and persists.

Thus, one loses the **Way** and then finds **virtue**,
loses **virtue** and then finds **ren**,
loses **ren** and then finds **yi**,
loses **yi** and then finds **li**.

For **li** is but the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,
yet the root of chaos.

Preconceived knowledge is but the superficial bloom of the **Way**,
yet the beginning of folly.

Therefore, the **great man** abides in its depth,
not dwelling in its shallowness.

He holds to its substance,
not lingering on its ornamentation.

Thus, he abandons that and takes this.

The *Original Meaning* says:
The **Way** is to tread.
**Virtue** is to attain.
To tread the **Way** and attain **virtue**—
this is called the **Way**’s highest **virtue**.

The heart of the **Way**’s highest **virtue** does not exalt itself in **virtue**,
so the hearts of people naturally turn to it—
thus, it has **virtue**, and its **virtue** is vast.

The heart of the **Way**’s lowest **virtue** does not forget itself in **virtue**,
so the hearts of people may not necessarily turn to it—
thus, it lacks **virtue**, and its **virtue** is small.

The **Way**’s highest **virtue** has no intention of acting,
no means to act—
this is the **Way**’s secondary aspect.

The **Way**’s lowest **virtue** has intention of acting,
means to act—
thus, its **virtue** is low.

The **Way**’s highest **ren** has intention of acting,
yet no means to act—
this is **virtue**’s secondary aspect.

The **Way**’s highest **yi** has intention of acting,
yet it has means to act—
this is **ren**’s secondary aspect.

The **Way**’s highest **li** has intention of acting,
yet none respond in kind—
this is **yi**’s secondary aspect.

If none respond with strength,
then the heart of the unworthy arises,
and when the heart of the unworthy arises,
it forces arms and persists—
this is not strange.

Thus, one loses the **Way** and then finds **virtue**,
loses **virtue** and then finds **ren**,
loses **ren** and then finds **yi**,
loses **yi** and then finds **li**.

For **li** is but the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,
yet the root of chaos.
Chaos brings forth much forcing of arms.

Preconceived knowledge is but the **Way**’s superficial bloom,
the **Way**’s lack of substance now revealed,
folly’s beginning.
The shallow customs are already evident—
thus, the **great man** abides in the **Way**’s depth and substance,
not dwelling in the **li**’s superficiality.

Hence, it is said: *abandon that and take this.*

Alas! The **Way** descends to become the **virtue** of the Emperor,
the Emperor’s **virtue** descends to become the **ren** and **yi** of the King,
the King’s **ren** and **yi** descend to become the **yi** and **strategy** of the **Duke**,
the **Duke**’s **strategy** descends to become the deceit and chaos of the Warring States,
forcing arms and persisting—
the people cannot endure it.

Thus, the **Way** of the **Way**’s highest and the **Way**’s lowest is revealed,
and the division of **virtue** and **desire** is established.
The *Spring and Autumn Annals* are composed,
and the distinctions of names are defined—
though the words differ, their meaning is one.

The **great man** with aspirations for his age,
aiming to enlighten the ruler and benefit the people,
need not be bound by office or seclusion—
he refines his words and establishes sincerity,
for the **Way** is within them.

The *Classic* says:
Those of old who attained **Oneness**—
the heavens attained **Oneness**, thus it was clear.
The earth attained **Oneness**, thus it was tranquil.
The **spirit** attained **Oneness**, thus it was responsive.
The **valleys** attained **Oneness**, thus they were full.
All things attained **Oneness**, thus they were born.
The lords and kings attained **Oneness**, thus they became the **acme** of the world.

If they overreach in attaining it—
the heavens, lacking clarity, would fear to split.
The earth, lacking tranquility, would fear to erupt.
The **spirit**, lacking responsiveness, would fear to stagnate.
The **valleys**, lacking fullness, would fear to dry.
All things, lacking birth, would fear to perish.
The lords and kings, lacking nobility, would fear to fall.

Thus, nobility is rooted in humility,
and height is founded on lowliness—
hence, lords and kings call themselves *lonely*, *few*, and *unfilled*—
this is their rooting in humility,
is it not?

Thus, they overreach in attaining **Oneness**,
yet have no **Oneness**—
they do not desire brilliance like jade,
nor aloofness like stone.

The *Original Meaning* says:
The **Way**’s presence among heaven, earth, **spirit**, things, and rulers of the people—
none lack their portion,
yet one can only diminish, not increase it.
Thus, the heavens diminish in the west and north,
the earth lacks in the east and south—
only by their diminishing and lacking,
and not by self-satisfaction,
can they endure long.

The Sage has no absolute power,
and the **Way** is the same.
Only by having no absolute power,
can one be called Sage.

If one understands this **Way** as a lord or king,
one must not fail to practice humility and self-lowering—
how much more so for subjects and commoners,
who do not know of humility and self-lowering!

Observing from the greatest aspect,
one should not cling to what should not be—
many such cases exist.
Observing from the smallest aspect,
one should not abandon what should be—
many such cases exist.

Since neither should be abandoned nor should be clung to,
many things can be diminished, yet not all—
the **Way** also has its portions.

Those of old who attained **Oneness**—
like heaven, earth, **spirit**, **valleys**, all things, and lords and kings—
none failed to attain their portion,
thus they could be clear, tranquil, responsive, full, born,
and become the **acme** of the world.
This is attaining to the extreme.

If they overreach to the extreme—
the heavens, lacking clarity, would fear to split.
The earth, lacking tranquility, would fear to erupt.
The **spirit**, lacking responsiveness, would fear to stagnate.
The **valleys**, lacking fullness, would fear to dry.
All things, lacking birth, would fear to perish.
The lords and kings, lacking nobility, would fear to fall.

If one lacks portions and yet seeks to contain them all,
how can it endure?

Thus, nobility is rooted in humility,
and height is founded on lowliness.
Knowing the danger of overreaching,
one must not forget humility and lowliness when in high and noble positions—
the foundation is thus secure.

Hence, lords and kings call themselves *lonely*, *few*, and *unfilled*—
speaking of their **virtue** being lonely and few,
words of self-humility.
This is their rooting in humility,
is it not?

Reflecting on their own words,
and yet sighing in lamentation,
thus they overreach in attaining **Oneness**,
yet have no **Oneness**—
speaking of **virtue**’s noble self-concealment.
If **virtue**’s noble self-concealment is within what I attain,
then those who have the heart to reveal and flaunt
will be few indeed.»

The Wheel, as an object, inherently possesses a complete form—
it cannot be said to have many spokes, yokes, hubs, or axles,
yet if one seeks to make it a Wheel by counting and demanding these parts,
then the Wheel is lost.

Thus, the Way of lords and kings does not desire
to be polished like jade (*琭琭*),
but rather to multiply their **virtue**.
Nor does it wish to be rugged like a *·* stone (*落落*),
but to diminish themselves through **virtue**.

Neither multiplying nor diminishing,
then the former attainment of **Oneness** naturally aligns with the proper distribution of parts.
When the proper distribution of parts is attained,
how can it not endure?

The *Classic* says:
*"Reversal is the movement of the Dao,
and weakness is its operation.*
All things under heaven are born of **Being**,
and **Being** is born of **Non-Being**."

The *Original Meaning* says:
*"Reversal is the movement of the Dao,
and weakness is its operation.*
The upper sentence speaks of **substance**,
the lower of **operation**.
The substance of the Dao is **operation** itself.
Thus, reversal and return are one—
returning to what reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth.
The Dao has no fixed substance,
only change is its substance.
When it moves, **Transformation** and **Manifestation** flow,
and all things are born.
Weakness is softness.
The soft and weak are the companions of life.
The Dao has no fixed operation,
only **Manifestation** is its operation.
When it operates, the intention of life unfolds and applies itself,
and all things find tranquility.

Ah! All things under heaven are born of **Being**,
and **Being** is born of **Non-Being**—
**Being** and **Non-Being**—
what are they truly?

**Void** transforms into **Spirit**,
**Spirit** transforms into **Qi**,
**Qi** transforms into **Form**—
all that possess **Form** and **Qi** are things.
Things must decay,
and when they decay, they return to **Non-Being**.
If there is **Oneness** that does not decay,
what remains is it?

Observing that **Qi** brings forth things,
one knows that **Spirit** generates **Qi**,
and **Spirit** is born of the Dao.
**Spirit** is nature,
**Qi** is fate—
together, they are called the Dao.
The Sage establishes teaching,
so that people may cultivate the Dao,
each rectifying their nature and fate—
this is rooted in this principle.

Zhongni exhausts nature to reach fate,
speaking of reversal to its end.
Zisii says fate is nature,
speaking of the origin of the beginning.
The Master Lao speaks of returning to fate but not of nature—
this is the saying that **Being** is born of **Non-Being**,
for nature is already present.

I have often discussed nature—
what I inherently possess—
and fate—
what Heaven bestows at the beginning of life.
Nature without fate,
I have no means to live.
Fate without nature,
Heaven has no means to bestow.
Nature and fate mutually nourish each other,
and only then is the Dao of life fully realized.
At the end of life,
when form perishes and fate returns,
only nature does not perish—
it endures with the Dao through long cultivation.
This is called cultivating the Dao.
Attaining this is called attaining the Dao.

Those who study the Dao may fail to examine their own original nature,
yet ask of others about fate—
this is not understanding the proper relationship between nature and fate.
I have obtained this principle and will expound it further.

The *Classic* says:
*"The superior man hears the Dao and diligently practices it.
The middle man hears the Dao and holds it uncertainly, as if it exists or does not.
The inferior man hears the Dao and laughs greatly at it.
If one does not laugh, it is not sufficient to be called the Dao.
Thus, the Sage’s speech is established as **Being**,
yet the Dao is as if in darkness.
Advancing the Dao is like retreating,
leveling the Dao is like obstructing it.
The highest **virtue** is like a valley,
the greatest brightness is like a stain,
the broadest **virtue** is like insufficiency,
the established **virtue** is like theft,
the genuine simplicity is like perversity.
The greatest square has no corners,
the greatest vessel is slow to form,
the greatest sound is rare in tone,
the greatest image is formless.
The Dao is hidden and nameless.
Only the Dao is good at lending itself and yet completing its task."*

The *Original Meaning* says:
*"The Dao has sentiment and trustworthiness,
no action and no form—
it can be transmitted but not received,
it can be attained yet not seen.
The superior man hears the Dao and comprehends its sentiment and trustworthiness,
and also grasps its actionless and formless nature—
thus, he diligently practices it.
The middle man hears the Dao and, though he comprehends its sentiment and trustworthiness,
has yet to grasp its actionless and formless nature—
thus, he holds it uncertainly, as if it exists or does not.
The inferior man hears the Dao and is perplexed by both aspects—
thus, he laughs greatly at it.
Indeed, the inferior man’s innate endowment is shallow,
and he is further drowned by human desires—
Heaven’s principles are not yet clear,
and the things of the world that have form and action,
he has yet to attain—
how much less could he grasp the Dao’s actionless and formless nature?
Thus, the inferior man cannot help but laugh.
If he does not laugh, it is not sufficient to reveal the greatness of my Dao.

Established speech, anciently spoken,
the Dao is as if in darkness,
advancing the Dao is like retreating,
leveling the Dao is like obstructing it,
the highest **virtue** is like a valley,
the greatest brightness is like a stain,
the broadest **virtue** is like insufficiency,
the established **virtue** is like theft,
the genuine simplicity is like perversity.
These eight aspects speak of the Dao’s **operation**—
**Being** as if **Non-Being**.

The greatest square has no corners,
the square has no corners, thus it is greatest.
The greatest vessel is slow to form,
the vessel is slow to form, thus it is greatest.
The greatest sound is rare in tone,
the sound is rare in tone, thus it is greatest.
The greatest image is formless,
the image is formless, thus it is greatest.
These four aspects speak of the Dao’s **substance**—
**reality** as if **void**.

The Dao is hidden and nameless,
known yet unsaid,
capable yet unacted upon.
Only the Dao is good at lending itself and yet completing its task.
Only because it is good at lending itself,
it can be transmitted.
Only because it is yet completing its task,
it can be attained.
Thus, the unattainable and unseen aspects of the Dao—
the Dao is not an external thing,
so it cannot be grasped by the hand or seen by the eye.
Only in hearing the Dao and diligently practicing it,
seeking its presence within oneself,
will one naturally attain it without waiting for reception or prolonged seeking.

The *Classic* says:
*"The Dao gives birth to **Oneness**,
**Oneness** gives birth to the **Two**,
the **Two** gives birth to the **Three**,
and the **Three** gives birth to all things.
All things bear **Yin** while embracing **Yang**,
and the interplay of **Qi** creates harmony.
What people detest are the lonely, few, and unfilled—
yet lords and kings take these as their titles.
Thus, things may be diminished to benefit,
or benefited to diminish.
What people teach is also what I teach.
The strong and rigid do not find their proper death—
I will take this as my teacher’s principle."*

The *Original Meaning* says:
*"The heart of Heaven and Earth in giving birth to things has no other purpose—
to block my **substance**,
to lead my **nature**,
and to harmonize the **Qi** of **Oneness** alone."*

The *Classic* says:
*"That which creates and gives birth does not exhaust itself in merging—
this, then, is what?*
**Succession and harmony** is **the central harmony**.

*The Dao gives birth to **Oneness**,
which is **the Unexcelled** and **the Supreme Unexcelled**.*
**Oneness** gives birth to the **Two**,
and the **Twofold Polarities** arise.
The **Two** gives birth to the **Three**,
and the **Three Powers** are established, giving birth to all things.
This is called **the Three giving birth to all things**.

All things bear **Yin** while embracing **Yang**,
and the interplay of **Qi** creates harmony.
**Heaven is Yang**, **Earth is Yin**—
the **Two Qi** intermingle and resonate,
refining their union to coalesce,
a singular point in the void,
thus forming **succession and harmony**.

The purest and most refined is **the Human**,
the mixed and irregular is **the Material**.
Humans and things receive their forms—
before and after, bowing and stooping—
embodying the **Yin-Yang** pattern.

Those who combine the **Three Powers** yet remain **Twofold** are found in me.
To uphold **central harmony** is to align with **Heaven and Earth**,
to nurture all things is to rectify the **Dao**.

Ah! **Heaven and Earth** are the parents of all things.
**Humans** are the **souls** of all things.
The **Directly Perceptive and Intelligent** act as the **Primordial Sovereign**,
the **Primordial Sovereign** nurtures the people as parents.
The **Sage** takes the **Heaven and Earth’s** nurturing of all things and the **people as their children** as his heart.

Alas, in the **Later Ages of the Three Dynasties**,
each valued **intellect and strength**,
contended for land, harming the people,
the rulers lost what they cherished,
the common folk suffered cruelty.
The **Mysterious Sage** embodied **Heaven and Earth’s** nurturing heart,
following the **Dao’s** **succession and harmony**,
valuing **gentleness and weakness**,
warning against **rigidity and strength**,
to teach and nurture the world.
Thus, he used the **lords and kings’** titles of **lonely, few, and unfilled** as an analogy:
*'What people detest are the lonely, few, and unfilled—
yet lords and kings take these as their titles.'*
This is to uphold **gentleness and weakness**,
yet **lonely, few, and unfilled** are paradoxically my virtues.
How much more so for those below—
who may boast of **intellect and strength**,
yet fail to recognize **rigidity and strength** as warnings?

Thus, things may be diminished to benefit,
or benefited to diminish.
Those who act in **Heaven’s Way** undetermined,
when human desires burn fiercely,
know only to boast of **intellect and strength** as victory.
The **gentle** suffer loss,
the **strong** gain benefit.
But once **Heaven’s Way** is established,
the **gentle** are benefited,
the **strong** are diminished.

Those who have not heard the **Dao**,
often value **intellect and strength**,
flaunt **rigidity and strength**,
and even teach others that **rigidity and strength** are good—
just as I uphold **central harmony**,
guard **gentleness and weakness**,
and teach others that **gentleness and weakness** are good.

The **Sage’s** and the **fool’s** perceptions differ as **Heaven and Earth**.
Yet the **strong and rigid** never meet their proper death—
this is a warning.
I will take this as my teacher’s principle.
To see the unvirtuous and reflect inwardly is also teaching and admonishing.

To cultivate oneself without understanding this is to fail in attaining **my central harmony**.
To govern the realm without understanding this is to fail in nurturing all things between **Heaven and Earth**.

The *Classic* says:
*'The utmost **gentleness** in the world
overcomes the utmost **firmness** in the world.
The **non-existent** enters the **non-gap**.
I know this is the benefit of **non-action**.
The teaching of **non-speech** is the benefit of **non-action**,
few in the world can attain it.'*

The *Original Meaning* says:
*'The previous chapter elucidates the **virtue of succession and harmony**,
to warn the **strong and rigid** that they will not meet their proper death.
This chapter speaks of the **principle of utmost gentleness**,
to illustrate that it overcomes the **utmost firmness** in the world.
These are all **Heaven’s Way** in its natural principles.
The **Sage** presents them clearly,
to warn the world—
not merely relying on empty words.
How can this be proven?
Observe the **Heavenly Movement** in the **Supreme Void**,
ancient and modern, ceaseless—
who compels it thus?
There is a **Bell** that tolls without rest to move it.
Thus it is said:
*The **floating Heaven** and the **bearing Earth** are **Qi**,
and **water**.
**Qi** is the **formless water**,
**water** is the **formed Qi**.
**Water**, though **gentle**, conquers **firmness**—
the **strong** cannot overcome it.
**Qi**, though **gentle**, moves and overcomes—
the **firmest** cannot resist it.
The **Sage** speaks of **utmost gentleness** yet does not mention **Qi**—
**Qi** is surely present.
**Heaven**, with its **succession and harmony** of **utmost gentleness**,
operates through the **dry and firm** body of **the Supreme Unexcelled**—
this is **the utmost gentleness** overcoming **the utmost firmness** in the world.
The **non-existent** enters the **non-gap**.
The **non-existent** is **Qi**.
**Qi** has no substance—
thus it is called **non-existent**.
The **non-gap** is **emptiness**.
Observe how the **non-existent Qi** enters the **Supreme Void’s** emptiness—
**Qi** acts without effort,
yet the four seasons proceed naturally.
The four seasons speak not,
yet all things are born—
its benefits are vast indeed.
Thus I know the benefit of **non-action**.
The teaching of **non-speech** is the benefit of **non-action**,
few in the world can attain it.

The phrase *"few in the world can attain it"* is an exclamation of lament.
The **Sage** embodies **Heaven’s Way**,
yet engages in **non-action** and **non-speech**,
to teach the world.
Simple and clear—
it should be trustworthy.
Yet why are there so few who believe and follow?
If belief does not reach them,
how can they act accordingly?
The **Sage** truly has no desires—
yet if people must be convinced,
the heart naturally laments this phrase,
which cannot be withheld.

This **Dao** was grasped by **Laozi** and **Confucius**,
yet they could not practice it in their age—
thus **Confucius** also had his sigh of *"I wish to speak but cannot."*
Again he said:
*"If there were someone who used me,
would I not make him the **Eastern Zhou**?"*
The **Sage’s** sorrow was for the world,
and he took the **Dao** upon himself.
If this is so,
could it be that he truly wished to speak but could not?
Could it not be that he wished to practice in his age?
There must have been reasons he could not—
and he accepted them.

The *Classic* says:
*'**Name** and **body**—which is closer?
**Body** and **wealth**—which is more?
**Gain** and **loss**—which is more harmful?
Thus, the more one loves,
the greater the expense.
The more one hoards,
the greater the loss.
To know **sufficiency** is to avoid disgrace.
To know **cessation** is to avoid peril.
This can endure long.'*

The *Original Meaning* says:
*'Nurturing life and preserving the body
is how one preserves **Heaven**.
To nurture life without knowing how to preserve the body,
or to preserve the body without knowing how to preserve **Heaven**,
is like feeding livestock.
All things that possess **Qi** and **body** between **Heaven and Earth**,
none lack their own nurturing."*

The *Classic* speaks:

*"Heaven grants to all things—
each has its own Dao and measure,
great and small, long and short,
not awaiting request,
yet those who nurture are never without sustenance.

Only because it is not awaited by seeking,
does one unseen receive what nourishes,
and when not sought, still not fail to receive what nourishes.
If one seeks and yet receives what nourishes,
or does not seek yet fails to receive what nourishes,
then Heaven would favor the private,
and desire that men obstruct themselves.

If Heaven desires that men obstruct themselves,
then sentient beings would long accumulate what nourishes yet never die,
and the insentient would fail to receive what nourishes, nearly perishing.
How can this be said to reflect Heaven’s utmost fairness?

Only because it is not awaited by seeking,
does one not dare to seek it.
This is how it becomes Heaven.
Why alone does man fail to perceive delusion,
and harbor the heart to seek more sustenance?

If one harbors the heart to seek more sustenance,
then the food of fame and the greed for wealth—
if not lost here, will be lost there,
and in reverse, one fails to preserve Heaven’s granted sustenance.
This is truly pitiable.

The Sage pities those who fail to awaken,
and instructs them:
Compare fame to the body—
which is closer?
Compare the body to wealth—
which is more?
Compare gain to loss—
which is more harmful?
The more one loves,
the greater the expense.
The more one hoards,
the greater the loss.
Only by knowing sufficiency
and not loving excessively,
does one avoid disgrace’s harm.
Knowing cessation
and not hoarding greatly,
does one avoid peril’s harm.
Then one may fulfill the goodness of nurturing,
and Heaven’s granted sustenance will be preserved.
This is how one may endure long.

For the ruler who knows this Dao,
he does not await the people’s seeking,
yet does not neglect what Heaven grants to nourish.
For the subject who knows this Dao,
he does not dare to seek from above,
yet remains content with his own self-nourishment.
Not loving excessively,
not hoarding greatly,
knowing cessation and sufficiency,
each preserving his own sustenance,
then households may endure,
and states may last long.

The *Classic* says:
*'Great completion seems deficient—
its use is not exhausted.
Great fullness seems empty—
its use is not spent.
Great uprightness seems bent—
great skill seems clumsy,
great eloquence seems inarticulate.
Agitation overcomes cold,
stillness overcomes heat,
and serene stillness is the Way’s rectitude for all under Heaven.'*

The *Original Meaning* says:
*'The virtue of humility is vast indeed!
Heaven’s Dao diminishes excess yet benefits humility,
so the lowly are rescued and radiance is clear.
Great completion seems deficient—
its use is not exhausted.
Earth’s Dao transforms excess into flowing humility,
so the lowly ascend upward.
Great fullness seems empty—
its use is not spent.
Ghosts and spirits harm excess yet favor humility,
so the honored are radiant.
Great uprightness seems bent.

Human nature abhors excess yet loves humility,
so the lowly are uncrossable.
Great skill seems clumsy.

The gentleman practices *kǎo* (积) the many and aiding the few,
balancing things with just application.
Great eloquence seems hesitant.

Agitation overcomes cold—
the earth lies above the mountains.
Stillness overcomes heat—
the mountains lie below the earth.
Serene stillness is the Way’s rectitude for all under Heaven.
Humility is the gentleman’s virtue,
and all the people serve it.

Ah! The Dao of the *Book of Changes* and the *Laozi*,
though named differently, springs from the same source.
The *Dao De Jing* unfolds in the mound and classic texts,
the *Yijing* manifests in diagrams and words.
All observe Heaven’s Dao to illuminate human nature.

The previous chapter speaks of fame and wealth
to warn against excessive love and hoarding,
and of gain and loss
to clarify knowing cessation and sufficiency—
thus the meaning of *kǎo* (积), aiding, and balanced application, is evident.

This chapter speaks of those who sing of ‘unknowing sufficiency’,
and desire gain to avoid blame and calamity,
thus the virtue of humility is clear.

Some say: *‘Shèng’* (胜) means ‘extreme’.
Extreme agitation brings cold,
extreme stillness brings heat—
this is speaking of *Qi*.
Some say: Agitation can overcome cold,
stillness can overcome heat—
this is speaking of *Dao*.

Humility is present indeed.
Yet then the *Hexagram of Humility*’s sixth line says:
*'Not enriching oneself with neighbors,
beneficial to use slander to invade and plunder.'*
And the top line says: *‘Resounding humility,
beneficial to use troops to march and conquer states.’*
But this lower chapter says:
*'When the Way prevails under Heaven,
the war-horses are turned back to manure.
When the Way does not prevail under Heaven,
war-horses are born in the suburbs.'*
Then humility’s words of invasion and marching troops—
is this not untenable?

Knowing lowliness yet uncrossable,
*aiding the many and the few* with balanced application—
this is acceptable.
If one must reach the point where war-horses are born in the suburbs,
what need has humility of such?

The Sage’s Dao of the *Laozi* teaches
that softness overcomes hardness,
thus aligning with humility.
Yet Shen Buhai and Han Fei failed to learn well,
descending into legalism and name-schooling,
becoming the wretched offenders of the Sage’s gate for ten thousand ages.

The *Classic* says:
*'When the Way prevails under Heaven,
the war-horses are turned back to manure.
When the Way does not prevail under Heaven,
war-horses are born in the suburbs.
No crime is greater than desiring gain,
no calamity greater than unknowing sufficiency,
no blame greater than coveting what is obtained.'*
Thus, the sufficiency of sufficiency,
is always sufficiency.

The *Original Meaning* says:
*'The ancient rulers of all under Heaven—
the vastness of their lands,
the multitude of their people,
the longevity of their sovereigns—
from Yao and Shun onward,
too distant to trace.
Yet in the words of the *Yugong*,
we see that Yao’s and Shun’s reigns
eastward reached the sea,
westward extended to the flowing sands,
northward to the boundless frontier,
and their teachings spread to all four seas.
Their people matched their lands.

Yao ruled as Son of Heaven,
Shun, Yu, Ji, Xie, and Gao Yao as ministers.
They swayed the people with ease—
none could name their virtue.
Manifest in the *Strike-the-Earth* song,
we know them as the age of the Way’s prevalence.
Yao was not yet very old,
yet he yielded the throne to Shun.
Shun followed Yao’s Dao,
not yet very old,
yet he yielded the throne to Yu.
Yao and Shun,
though not losing Heaven’s honor and eminence,
both lived over a hundred years,
and their descendants did not lose their lands’ boundaries,
nor abandon the duty of ancestral sacrifices.
Such as the two Sages,
can truly be called sufficiency’s sufficiency—
always sufficiency.

When the Way prevails under Heaven,
the war-horses are turned back to manure—
the prosperity of Tang and Yu is evident.
When the Way does not prevail under Heaven,
war-horses are born in the suburbs—
the decline of Xia and Shang is evident.
No crime is greater than desiring gain—
excessive love brings great expense.'*

Misfortune knows no greater than the failure to know sufficiency—
excessive hoarding brings swift ruin.

No fault is greater than the desire to possess—
what I desire to possess, others also desire to possess.
Why then would the world not contend?
Why would war-horses not multiply?

To flee what is without the Way
and seek what is with the Way,
is better than enduring the decline of Xia and Shang,
and striving for the prosperity of Tang and Yu.
To know sufficiency is to always suffice—
thus one will not lose the eminence of Yao and Shun.

Yet if the Way prevails under Heaven,
it must have rulers like Yao and Shun,
ministers like Gao Yao and Kui,
and people like those of Tang and Yu—
then every household may be ennobled,
and all will recognize the weight of the world,
without harming their own lives.

Who then would bear the guilt of desire,
the calamity of insatiability,
the fault of covetousness?

The *Classic* says:
Without leaving one’s door, one knows the world.
Without peering through a window, one sees the Way of Heaven.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.

Thus the Sage acts without knowing,
names without seeing,
accomplishes without doing.

The *Original Meaning* says:
Without leaving one’s door, one knows the world—
this is the speech of the Sage who follows the Way.
Who else but Yu and Yi refused Yao’s abdication?

Without peering through a window, one sees the Way of Heaven—
Yu declined Yao’s throne, saying:
“The sun and moon have risen,
timely rains descend,
the glow of torches and the nourishment of irrigation—
are they not difficult and laborious?”

Yu’s refusal to descend from Mount Ji,
this was how he knew the world.
Once order is established,
the farther one goes, the less one knows—
this is the fate of those who stop at insatiability.
The Way does not prevail, yet they know—
this is why Yu did not succeed Yao.

“To name without seeing”—
shall I seek fame?
Or shall I be a guest?

“To accomplish without doing”—
I have no need of the world’s affairs.

Yu’s refusal of Yao’s abdication
was to achieve eternal renown without leaving his door—
perhaps he was even more virtuous than Yao.

The cow of Chu Fu
would not drink from the Washui River—
this was to bear no name of right or wrong without peering through a window,
and thus surpass even Yu.

Yao passed the Mandate to Shun,
Shun to Yu.
Yao and Shun were Sages with both the Way and position,
Chu Fu and Yu were Sages with the Way but without position.
Those like Chu Fu and Yu
can be said to have no fame yet achieve fame—
this is to accomplish without doing.

Zhuangzi and Huizi observed fish by the Hao Pond.
Zhuangzi said:
“The carp glides leisurely—
this fish is joyful.”

Huizi said:
“You are not a fish—
how do you know the fish is joyful?”

Zhuangzi replied:
“I know it at the Hao Pond.
The waters of the Hao are deep,
nets cannot reach them,
and the fish do not need to leap from the pond.
Yet I know that in all the world’s waters,
there are still nets that harm them.
Thus they rejoice in their leisure,
and do not emerge.”

The fish’s refusal to leap from the Hao Pond
is like Chu Fu and Yu’s refusal to descend from Mount Ji.

Alas! Without the Later Kings,
we could not see the Sagehood of Yao and Shun.
Without Yao and Shun,
we could not see the exalted virtue of Chu Fu and Yu.

The *Classic* says:
To study is to daily increase,
to follow the Way is to daily decrease.
Decrease until it is empty,
until there is no doing—
no doing, yet nothing remains undone.
To take the world,
one must act with non-action.
When action arises,
it is insufficient to take the world.

The *Original Meaning* says:
To study is to increase—
this is the way of the common people.
To follow the Way is to decrease—
this is the way of the Sage.

The wise cannot lack human-heartedness,
the foolish cannot lack Dao-heartedness.
When Yao entrusted the Mandate to Shun, he said:
“Hold fast to the Mean—
what more could be subtracted?”

When Shun entrusted the Mandate to Yu,
he added words of human-heartedness, Dao-heartedness, and perilous subtlety—
this was what could not be avoided in decreasing.

To decrease again and again,
until there is no doing—
no doing, yet nothing remains undone.
“Decrease” means to remove human desires.
“Decrease again” means to purge human desires utterly.
When human desires are purged,
there is no indulging in self.
Without indulging in self,
all that is done is what Heaven’s principle demands,
and cannot but be done.

As Yu’s flood control—
passing his door three times without entering—
his labor is evident.
Yet he said, *“Act in what is without doing,”*
thus revealing that all Yu did
was what must be done and could not be avoided.

“To take the world” means not to take
the world’s lands and people,
its dogs and horses, its jade and silk.
It means to take joy in what others deem good.
“Without doing” means to act in what is without doing.
Only by taking joy in what others deem good
and acting in what is without doing
will the world rally to you,
as water flows downward.

When action arises,
it is insufficient to take the world.
“Action” means forcing others to follow you
because you believe none are your equal—
this is the way of the common people.
How could it suffice to take the world?

The *Book of Documents* says:
Do not deviate from the Way to seek the people’s praise,
nor deceive the people to satisfy your desires.
These words are well taken.

The *Classic* says:
The Sage has no fixed heart,
but takes the hearts of the people as heart.
The good, I make good;
the ungood, I also make good—virtue is good.
The trustworthy, I trust;
the untrustworthy, I also trust—virtue is trust.
The Sage moves through the world with solemnity,
harmonizing the hearts of the people.
The people all focus their ears and eyes,
while the Sage treats them like infants.

The *Original Meaning* says:
The Sage responds to things without being preceded by them,
thus having no fixed heart.
This follows the meaning of the previous chapter:
virtue and the Way can be constant,
but the heart cannot be constant.
The heart of the Sage is vast as the sky without clouds,
still as water without ripples.
Fish leap, kites fly—
nothing escapes its response.
Thus the Sage unifies all things,
and flows with the high and low,
harmonizing with Heaven and Earth,
taking the hearts of the people as heart.

With the hearts of the people as my own,
then there is nothing that does not respond naturally—
I simply respond to it with the Way.

The virtuous, I respond to with virtue—
the unvirtuous, I also respond to with virtue—**virtue is virtue**.
The trustworthy, I respond to with trust—
the untrustworthy, I also respond to with trust—**virtue is trust**.

Virtue has no constant teacher,
but takes virtue itself as its teacher.
Thus, all virtue under Heaven is virtue,
and no one fails to be virtuous.

With trust as the trust of all under Heaven,
no one fails to be trustworthy.

The Sage moves through the world with solemnity,
harmonizing the hearts of all people.
The Sage with **positioned speech**—
like **Emperor Yao** in his **tolerant governance** of all.

**Shun told Yu**:
*"Consult the multitude,
abandon self to follow others,
do not oppress the helpless,
do not neglect the poor and destitute.
Only when the **Emperor’s timing** is perfect,
does solemnity and harmonization of hearts appear."*

The people all focus their ears and eyes,
while Heaven sees as the people see,
Heaven hears as the people hear—
virtue and transformation spread,
where hearts naturally turn.
The Sage treats them all as infants—
**one regards them with the eyes of a赤子 (*baby/innocent child*).**

As for **啮缺 (*Niè Kuē*)**, though he could be the father of the multitude,
he could not be the father of the multitude’s father—
he was but a single step removed from **Emperor Yao**.

The *Classic* says:
*"To be born and enter death,
those who belong to life are thirteen in ten,
those who belong to death are thirteen in ten.
Humans who live,
thirteen in ten move toward death’s domain.
Why is this so?
Because of the **thick nourishment of life**.*

I have heard that those who skillfully **cultivate life (*shè shēng*)***
walk on land and do not meet **兕 (*rú*)** or tigers,
enter armies and are not struck by weapons or soldiers.
**兕 (*rú*)** have nowhere to lodge their horns,
tigers have nowhere to place their claws,
soldiers have nowhere to wield their blades.
Why is this so?
Because there is no **death’s domain** for them.

The *Original Meaning* says:
*"All things under Heaven and Earth,
none do not have **clans** and **ancestors**.
**Clans** refer to their multitude,
**ancestors** refer to their intimacy.
This is the great **连庐 (*lián lú*)** of Heaven and Earth and all things.
To be born and enter death—
life brings death,
death brings life—
this is the constant principle of Heaven.
How could the heart interfere with it?

Knowing my **出 (*chū*)** and **入 (*rù*)**—
never having been born,
never having died—
then who are those who belong to life?
Who are those who belong to death?
And who are those who belong to neither life nor death?

Life is thirteen in ten,
death is thirteen in ten,
neither life nor death is thirteen in ten—
this makes nine.
What kind of thing is this?

The **Dao** is tenfold,
the **三才 (*Three Powers*)** each take their three,
and the remaining one is the **祖 (*ancestor*)** of **太极 (*Tàijí*)**.
Those who belong to life are the **天三阳 (*Heaven’s Three Yang*)**—
light and clear **气 (*qi*)**, the kin of the sun, moon, and stars.
Those who belong to death are the **地三阴 (*Earth’s Three Yin*)**—
heavy and turbid **气 (*qi*)**, the kin of mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees.
Those who belong to neither life nor death are the **人三元 (*Human’s Three Elements*)**—
**冲和 (*chōng hé*)** **气 (*qi*)**, the kin of **精 (*jing*)**, **气 (*qi*)**, and **神 (*shén*)**.

Humans as humans,
none do not combine these **Three Powers**,
while also embracing the **祖 (*ancestor*)** of **太极 (*Tàijí*)**,
thus attaining their life.
This is what **Mencius** called:
*'All things are complete within me'*—
humans are thus noble as well.

Having attained their life,
they do not regard it as their own.
Those who **nourish their ancestor** while being intimate,
yet **move toward death’s domain**—
this is truly pitiful.

Why is this so?
Because they forget their own source of nobility,
yet seek externally to add to their nourishment,
increasing their **thick nourishment of life**.
This is called **calculating on the left**—
once the heart is set upon this,
they will **enter tiger’s dens** and **tread upon white blades**,
unmindful of peril and ruin,
and none will refrain.

I have heard that those who skillfully **cultivate life (*shè shēng*)***
walk on land and do not meet **兕 (*rú*)** or tigers—
they have no **心 (*heart*)** of entering dens.
Enter armies and are not struck by weapons or soldiers—
they have no **心 (*heart*)** of treading blades.
From where does **兕 (*rú*)** come to lodge its horns?
From where does the tiger come to place its claws?
From where do soldiers come to wield their blades?
Why is this so?
Because I have no **death’s domain**,
and thus nothing can harm me.

The *Classic* says:
*"The Dao **gives birth** to it,
**virtue** **nurtures** it,
things **take form** from it,
**势 (*shì*)** **completes** it.
Thus all things do not fail to **revere the Dao** and **honor virtue**.
The Dao’s reverence, virtue’s honor—
none bestow titles upon it,
yet it remains ever naturally so.
Hence the Dao **gives birth**, **nurtures**, **lengthens**, **rears**, **completes**, **ripens**, **nourishes**, and **covers**.
It **gives birth** yet does not possess,
**acts** yet does not rely,
**lengthens** yet does not control—
this is called **玄德 (*Xuán Dé*)** **virtue/power**."*

The *Original Meaning* says:
*"The Dao gives birth,
virtue nurtures,
things take form,
**势 (*shì*)** completes—
this follows the meaning of the previous chapter.
It speaks of Heaven and Earth and all things,
all born from **Dao/Way** **气 (*qi*)**.
The Dao is the **祖 (*ancestor*)** of things—
all marvels are within it.
Its **形 (*form*)** is singular,
its **生 (*birth*)** is boundless.

Virtue is the **族 (*clan*)** of things—
its **一 (*oneness*)** is in the unformed.
When **nurturing** reaches its peak,
things attain their **形 (*form*)** and **势 (*shì*)**—
its **一 (*oneness*)** is in the formed,
and things each **complete their appearance**.

When **势 (*shì*)** is completed,
their **貌 (*appearance*)** and **象 (*form*)** are manifest,
their **声 (*sound*)** and **色 (*color*)** are present.
The grand—Heaven’s **穹窿 (*qióng lóng*)** dome,
Earth’s **磅砖 (*páng zhèn*)** vastness—
the minute—**朝菌 (*zhāo jūn*)**’s transformation,
**蜩 (*tiáo*)**’s shell and **蛇 (*snake*)**’s slough—
all are **祖 (*ancestors*)**, **族 (*clans*)**, and **道 (*Dao*)** **德 (*virtue*)** becoming things.

Thus all things do not fail to **revere the Dao** and **honor virtue**.
The Dao’s reverence, virtue’s honor—
none bestow titles upon it,
yet it remains ever naturally so.
Saying it is **族 (*clan*)**, saying it is **祖 (*ancestor*)**—
this is to be **子 (*son*)** of Heaven and Earth,
and **孙 (*grandson*)** of all things.
Who then bestows titles?
Virtue and the Way are constant and natural.
Hence it is said:
**'The Dao gives birth, nurtures, lengthens, rears, completes, ripens, nourishes, and covers.
It gives birth yet does not possess,
acts yet does not rely,
lengthens yet does not control—
this is called **玄德 (*Xuán Dé*)** **virtue/power**.'***

The Sage embodies the Dao as his heart,
**completing** all things,
yet does not **控 (*control*)** their **玄德 (*Xuán Dé*)** **virtue/power**—
this is the **玄德 (*Xuán Dé*)** of the Sage.
**Shun’s** **玄德 (*Xuán Dé*)** **virtue/power** ascending and heard,
is also this Dao.

The *Classic* says:
*"Heaven and Earth have their beginning,
and it is called the **mother** of Heaven and Earth.
Having obtained their mother,
one knows their children."*

Having known its children, return and safeguard its mother—
then one’s life will never perish.
Close the senses’ openings, shut the gates—
then one’s whole life will know no toil.
Open the senses’ openings, aid in affairs—
then one’s whole life will know no salvation.

To see what is small is called **clarity**—
to hold fast to softness is called **strength**.

Employ its radiance, then return to its clarity—
no calamity will befall the body—
this is called **clinging to the constant**.

The *Original Meaning* says:
The world has a beginning—
and that beginning is **One**.
There is the beginning before parents were born,
the beginning before Heaven and Earth took form,
the beginning before there was any beginning—
its origin is ancient indeed.
How could one not say that the **Divine One** attains **spirituality** through **Oneness**?

The Dao speaks of **Divine Clarity**,
the Release School speaks of **Spiritual Radiance**,
the Confucian speaks of **Keen Insight**—
all speak of the same beginning.

This is called the **mother** of the world.
The **mother** is that from which all things emerge.
No one lacks this mother.
Having obtained the mother, **spirituality** is born from **clarity**,
and knowing its children, **clarity** gives rise to **radiance**.

Having known its children, return and safeguard its mother—
know that its radiance must be guarded,
its clarity must not depart.
When radiance does not depart from clarity,
then **Divine Clarity** is preserved.
Though the body perishes, the clarity will not fail.

The mother is also **qi**.
The child is **spirit**.
When **spirit** and **qi** guard each other,
then **radiance** and **clarity** arise.

The **Nurture-Life** school speaks of
sealing the senses and lowering the curtain,
retracting sight and returning hearing—
this is rooted in this principle.

To close the senses’ openings, shut the gates—
this is the **Way** for oneself.
Internally attaining its nourishment,
then **Divine Clarity** is preserved.
When **Divine Clarity** is preserved,
then one’s whole life will know no toil is fitting.

To open the senses’ openings, aid in affairs—
this is the **Way** for others.
Externally attaining its nourishment,
then it manifests as deeds and enterprises.
When enterprises are accomplished,
then one’s whole life will know no regret is fitting.

Thus, **Fu Xi** attained it to **inherit the mother’s qi**,
the **Yellow Emperor** attained it to **ascend to the Clouded Sky**,
while **Tang and Wu** with their lifespans of no more than a hundred years,
plotted to establish enterprises lasting a thousand ages.

The **Way** of **inner Sagehood and outer Kingship** differs thus.

To see what is small is called **clarity**—
knowing the subtle and the manifest.
Smallness carries the meaning of **children**.
To hold fast to softness is called **strength**—
knowing softness and hardness.
Softness carries the meaning of **mother**.

To employ its radiance—radiance of the **child**,
the **mother** summons her **child**.
To return and restore its clarity—clarity of the **mother**,
the **child** hides within the **mother’s womb**.
This is the **Way** of knowing the **child** and safeguarding the **mother**.

If guarded without loss,
then calamity will not reach the body—
this is called **clinging to the constant**.
**Clinging** means **uniting**.
Uniting with the **Great Constant**—
this is called **"steadfastly holding the central"**,
this is called **"standing alone, unchanging"**,
this is called **"not leading the myriad laws"**—
all share this **Way**.

Is this not the **Great Man’s** exit from the world,
his accomplishments fulfilled and name established?

The *Classic* says:
*"Let me be resolutely aware—
walking the Great Dao,
only reverence is feared.
The Great Dao is smooth,
yet people love shortcuts.
The court is ever more empty,
the fields ever more overgrown,
the granaries ever more bare.
They wear embroidered robes,
belt sharp swords,
carry food and goods—
wealth overflows.
This is called **robber’s boast**—
not the Dao indeed."*

The *Original Meaning* says:
The **Old Sage** sighed at the decline of the Three Dynasties,
when feudal lords contended for hegemony,
the people barely surviving,
and thus composed words to lament himself:
*"Let me be resolutely aware of governance—
walking the Great Dao,
only reverence is feared.
Your words do not stir strife.
If the ruler does not stir strife, the people are at ease,
and the people at ease, the state is governed.
This is called **‘no neglect, no waste’**—
the four quarters bring tribute as kings.
The Great Dao is the **straight path**.
The **shortcut** is the **byway**.
Speaking of how, at that time, feudal lords and great ministers
pursued merit through martial prowess,
loved wealth and indulged in luxury,
abandoning the straight path and not following it,
prioritizing schemes that sparked contention across the land.

The court is ever more empty—
officials proliferate, palaces grow extravagant.
The fields are ever more overgrown—
the people scatter, farmlands lie fallow.
The granaries are ever more bare—
grain is depleted, storehouses are utterly empty.

Clothing should suffice to cover the body—
why adorn with embroidery?
The belt should suffice for stability—
why carry a sharp sword?
Food should suffice to fill the stomach—
why indulge in rich delicacies to gluttony?
Wealth should suffice for practical use—
why hoard treasures beyond necessity?

All these bring no benefit to life,
yet harm governance.
This is called **robbery’s boast of wealth**—
not the Sage’s **Way**."*

The *Classic* says:
*"The well-built does not topple,
the well-embraced does not slip,
and descendants offer unbroken sacrifices.
Cultivate it in the self, its virtue becomes **true**.
Cultivate it in the family, its virtue becomes **abundant**.
Cultivate it in the village, its virtue becomes **long-lasting**.
Cultivate it in the state, its virtue becomes **prosperous**.
Cultivate it in the world, its virtue becomes **universal**.
Thus, observe the self to understand the self,
observe the family to understand the family,
observe the village to understand the village,
observe the state to understand the state,
observe the world to understand the world.
How do I know the world is thus?
By this."*

The *Original Meaning* says:
The establishment of the *Hong Fan* [Classic]
uses the **Royal Pivot** to set an example for the people.
The Sage’s **embracing of Oneness**
is the model for the world,
the foundation for establishing the people’s fate.

To **build** must be like Heaven and Earth’s **upright mountains**,
eternally unshaken—
to **embrace** must be like rivers and seas **encompassing the land**,
eternally unbroken—
only then can one speak of **excellence**.

**Yu** completed the waterworks,
extended the Five Regions outward,
approaching the Four Seas,
establishing the Five Ministers—
how could this not be **unshaken**?
With ancestral temples and people—
how could this not be **unbroken**?
With the virtue of **Qi’s** descendants,
passed down through generations,
how could sacrifices not continue?
Yet see **Yu’s** ancestor,
and **Jie’s** descendant.
**Jie’s** virtue was in darkness,
the people plunged into suffering—
once the people’s hearts departed,
the ancestral temples were lost.
Where are the ancestral sacrifices now?
This is because **Jie** failed to know
**self-cultivation** reaching this far.
**Shang’s** **Zhou** was the same.

Thus the Sage could not but speak—
for from the Son of Heaven to the commoner,
all must take **self-cultivation** as the foundation.
Yet the **true Dao** is for governing the self,
its remnants for governing the state,
its dregs for governing the world.

「When governance grows broader, the Dao grows more distant—
one must know what to guard with caution.

Cultivate within the self,
and its virtue becomes true.
Guard carefully the cultivation of the self,
and the true virtue is attained.

Cultivate within the family,
and its virtue becomes the remnant.
If one can master the family,
then blessings shall overflow abundantly.

Cultivate within the village,
and its virtue becomes enduring.
Thus one becomes a friend to the virtuous of the village.

Cultivate within the state,
and its virtue becomes abundant.
All its people shall take delight in it.

Cultivate within the world,
and its virtue becomes universal.
All under heaven shall admire it.

Therefore, to observe the self through the self,
the self shall be cultivated.
To observe the family through the family,
the family shall be harmonized.
To observe the village through the village,
the village shall flourish.
To observe the state through the state,
the state shall be well-ordered.
To observe the world through the world,
the world shall be in peace.

How do I know this is so?
By observing through this Dao—
then it can be understood.

The *Classic* says:
The depth of virtue is like that of an infant.
Venomous insects do not sting,
ferocious beasts do not attack,
and crows do not swoop.
Though bones are frail and sinews soft,
its grasp is firm.
It knows not the union of male and female,
yet cries when needed—
the utmost purity of essence.

All day it weeps without hoarseness,
the utmost harmony of qi.
To know harmony is to know constancy,
to know constancy is to know clarity,
to nurture life is auspicious,
to let the heart command the qi is strength.

When things reach their peak,
they grow old—
this is called *not the Dao*,
and *not the Dao* brings early decline.

The *Original Meaning* says:
The depth of virtue—
the previous chapter spoke of cultivating virtue and observing virtue,
not mentioning what virtue lies in,
but here it speaks of the depth of virtue,
comparing it to an infant.
Thus the virtue of an infant is virtue itself.

Observing its essence complete and qi harmonized,
its softness and weakness as true constancy,
the virtue of an infant is evident.
As for venomous insects, ferocious beasts, and ravenous crows,
all are the utmost evil of things,
with hearts of poison and harm,
yet they do not sting, attack, or swoop upon the infant.
This has no other reason—
it is the utmost power of gentle virtue.

In the chapter of birth and death,
there is no death,
and its virtue resembles this.
These venomous insects are all creatures with poison,
yet they lack wisdom.
They still do not harm the infant,
how much less would the wise harm it?
Yet those evil men, though they act unvirtuously,
are they truly without wisdom?
They simply lack the capacity to inflict harm.

The infant’s bones are frail, sinews soft—
initially, it has no great strength,
yet its grasp is firm.
It knows not the union of male and female,
initially having no carnal desires,
yet cries when needed—
the utmost purity of essence.

All day it weeps without hoarseness,
the utmost harmony of qi.
Harmony is the constancy of virtue,
to know harmony is to know constancy,
to know constancy is to know clarity,
and clarity encompasses all without exclusion.

To nurture life is auspicious,
and auspiciousness is omens.
With a heart that nurtures life,
even virtue becomes ominous.

To let the heart command the qi is strength—
the heart of one near death.
To let the heart command the qi is the sign of one nearing death.

When things reach their peak,
they grow old,
and old they die—
this is called *not the Dao*.
This has no other reason—
when gentle virtue is lost,
it is not a lasting way,
only early decline.

The *Classic* says:
The wise do not speak,
those who speak lack wisdom.
Block the mouth of the *Jue* [1],
close the gates of the *Men* [2],
dull the sharp,
untangle the chaotic,
harmonize the light,
blend with the dust—
this is called *mysterious observation*.

One cannot draw near or keep at a distance,
cannot profit or harm,
cannot elevate or degrade—
thus it is held in highest honor by all under heaven.

The *Original Meaning* says:
Those who harbor the Dao
can be sullied or exalted,
rise and fall with the times,
be seen as foolish or wise,
float and sink with the world.

Like the hidden few of Nan Guo Zi Ran,
or the feigned simplicity of Yan Zi,
this is the wise who do not speak.
Like the disputations of Gong Sun Long,
this is the speaker who lacks wisdom.
His wisdom is attainable,
his foolishness is not.

To block the *Jue* and close the gates,
to dull the sharp and untangle the chaotic,
to harmonize the light and blend with the dust—
these six are mysteriously unified,
thus one cannot draw near or keep at a distance,
lacking a heart of praise or encouragement.
One cannot profit or harm,
lacking a heart of covetousness or malice.
One cannot elevate or degrade,
lacking a heart of ambition or disgrace.

All these are insufficient to burden the heart,
thus one can remain at ease in the times and顺顺 [3],
living as if floating,
dying as if resting—
death and life bring no change to oneself,
how much less the matters of profit and harm?
Thus one can be like the deep stillness before thunder,
mysteriously unified with all phenomena,
moving divinely as heaven follows,
without revealing its jade-like angles,
so that the common folk may not recognize it—
hence it is held in highest honor by all under heaven.

The *Classic* says:
Govern the state with *zhèng* [4],
employ *qí* [5] in warfare,
and take the world with no action.
How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

The world has many taboos,
yet the people grow poorer.
The people have many tools of profit,
yet the state grows more chaotic.
Men have many clever arts,
yet strange things proliferate.
Laws and decrees grow ever more prominent,
yet thieves and robbers abound.
Thus the Sage says:
I take no action,
yet the people transform themselves.
I love tranquility,
yet the people become upright.
I have no affairs,
yet the people grow rich.
I have no desires,
yet the people return to simplicity.

The *Original Meaning* says:
*Zhèng* is governance.
The myriad achievements of Yao were all harmonious,
and the hundred measures of Shun were timely and ordered—
this is to govern the state with *zhèng*.

*Qí* is the variation of *zhèng*.
Yu’s battle-array was marshaled for seven months,
and the Miao tribes were subdued—
this is to employ *qí* in warfare.
Tang [6] waged war because Jie’s descendant failed to sacrifice,
and thus he extinguished eleven states.
Jie, though abandoned, still possessed the myriad Xia—
this was the next degree of *qí*.

The Zhou [7] waged war because Jie’s descendant did not follow the Dao,
and at the great assembly at the River Jin,
they battled at Mu Ye,
and Jie’s descendant, though burned, still held the myriad Shang—
this was yet another degree of *qí*.

The *Art of War* says:
The highest warfare is to strike the plans,
the next is to sever alliances,
the next is to strike the armies.»

[1] *Jue* (兑) – The *Jue* hexagram in the *Yijing* (Classic of Changes), representing joy, exhilaration, or the mouth.
[2] *Men* (门) – The *Men* hexagram in the *Yijing*, representing the gate or doorway.

[6] *Tang* (汤) – King Tang of Shang, here referring to the legendary founder of the Shang dynasty.
[7] *Zhou* (周) – The Zhou dynasty, here referring to the Western Zhou or King Wu of Zhou.

From the examples of **Yǔ’s** conquest of the **Yóu Mín** (有苗), **Táng’s** expedition against **Xià** (夏), and **Zhōu’s** assault on **Shāng** (商), we see the principle at work.

When this is carried further, the *Qí* (奇) transforms into *Zhà* (诈)—deception—
and deception then gives rise to *Luàn* (乱)—chaos.

To acquire the realm with no action of one’s own,
is to embody the *Zhāng Mò* (章末) doctrine of *Wúwéi* (无为) and love of stillness,
of *Wúshì* (无事) and *Wúyù* (无欲).

How do I know this to be true?
For when the **Zhōu** dynasty declined in the middle,
King **Lì** (厉王) coveted profit,
and appointing **Róng Gōng** (荣公) as his minister,
he monopolized gain and harmed the people,
so when the **Wèi** (卫) perverts and **Wū** (巫) censors reported him,
he had them killed.
The land was filled with taboos,
yet the people grew ever poorer.

The **Huái Yí** (淮夷) raided in rebellion,
and the people rose up against one another.
King **Yōu** (幽王) fled to **Jìng** (竞),
and the **Gònghè** (共和) administration took charge,
as the people multiplied their clever devices
and the state flourished in corruption.

King **Yōu** (幽王) grew dissolute and debauched,
and appointed **Shí Fù** (石父) as his minister,
who was skilled in flattery and profit-seeking,
entrusted with affairs and given full authority,
his governance filled with perversity,
so some lords rebelled,
while the **Róng-Dí** (戎狄) slew him.

When men abound in cunning arts,
strange contrivances multiply,
laws and decrees grow ever more explicit,
and thieves and robbers proliferate.

Thus the sage says:
*"If I act with **Wúwéi** (无为), the people will transform themselves;
If I love **jìng** (静), the people will become upright;
If I have **Wúshì** (无事), the people will grow rich;
If I have **Wúyù** (无欲), the people will return to simplicity."*

The words of the ancient sages,
the **Xuánshèng** (玄圣) cites them as proof,
are they not in accord with the sayings of *Fén* (坟) and *Diǎn* (典)?

In the second year of King **Yōu** (幽王),
the three rivers of the **Xī Zhōu** (西周) trembled.
The Grand Historian **Bó Yáng Fù** (伯阳父) declared:
*"In days past, when the **Yí** (伊) and **Luò** (洛) rivers dried up, **Xià** (夏) perished;
when the **Jiāng** (江) river dried up, **Shāng** (商) perished.
Now the **Zhōu** (周) **virtue** (德) is like that of the three dynasties in their decline—
they will not endure beyond the count of ten years."*

That year, the three rivers dried up,
and the **Qí Shān** (岐山) collapsed.
Three years later, the **Shēn Hòu** (申侯) was deposed,
and the former heir **Yí Jiù** (宜臼) was removed,
while favor was bestowed upon **Bào Sì** (褒姒) as queen,
and her son **Bó Fú** (伯服) was made heir.

The **Bó Yáng** (伯阳) read the records and said:
*"The **Zhōu** (周) is already destroyed."*

In the eleventh year, the king sought to kill the former heir **Yí Jiù** (宜臼),
and marched against **Shēn** (申).
The **Shēn Hòu** (申侯) allied with the **Dèng** (邓) people,
summoning the **Xī Yí** (西夷) and **Quǎn Róng** (犬戎),
to attack and slay the king,
and install the former heir **Yí Jiù** (宜臼) as **Píng Wáng** (平王).
He relocated to the **East Capital** (东都),
and the **West Capital** (西周) was indeed abandoned.

**Bó Yáng** (伯阳), surnamed **Lǎoshèng** (老圣),
once served **Xī Bó** (西伯) as the **Cángshǐ** (藏史),
and under King **Chéng** (成王) as **Zhùxiàshǐ** (柱下史),
while in the time of King **Yōu** (幽王) he was the **Grand Historian** (太史).
He cultivated the **Dao** (道) and nourished his years,
often holding the **Shìkuài** (史快) office,
and expounding the *Xuánjīng* (玄经).
His divinations and records endure for ten thousand generations—
this is what I call the **nameless ancient historian** (无名古史),
whose truth can now be verified.

Though his station was that of a subject,
his **Dao** (道) surpassed that of a hundred kings—
he was a sage who held the **Dao** (道) yet lacked position.

The *Jīng* (经) states:
*"When governance is **mènmèn** (闷闷) [deep and unobtrusive],
its people are **chúnhún** (淳淳) [pure and sincere].
When governance is **cháhè** (察察) [sharp and scrutinizing],
its people are **quēquē** (缺缺) [deficient and cunning]."*

Misfortune, oh, where fortune leans,
Fortune, oh, where misfortune lurks—
Who knows their ultimate measure?
Is it not the absence of **Zhèng** (正)?

**Zhèng** (正) becomes *Qí* (奇),
**Shàn** (善) becomes *Yāo* (妖).
The people’s confusion is indeed long-standing.

Thus the sage is square yet does not cut,
honest yet not harsh,
upright yet not domineering,
bright yet not dazzling.

The *Yuanzhǐ* (原旨) says:
*"Governance like that of **Fūzǐ** (夫子) [the sage],
where **virtue** (德) is the foundation of **mènmèn** (闷闷) governance,
and **Lǐ** (礼) is used for harmonization—
its policies are broad and expansive,
and the people take joy in their work,
while customs become **chúnhún** (淳淳) and **cháhè** (察察).*

*"Or governance like that of **Qí** (齐),
where **Xíng** (刑) [laws] are enforced strictly—
its decrees are severe and rigid,
and the people are left bewildered and at a loss,
their actions **quēquē** (缺缺).*

*"This is the saying: ‘When the upper levels carve too finely,
the lower levels respond with **Bùxiào** (不肖) [depravity].’*
Misfortune, oh, where fortune leans,
Fortune, oh, where misfortune lurks—
relying on fortune to act arrogantly,
misfortune is soon to follow;
fearing misfortune and cultivating **virtue** (德),
fortune is soon to follow.
Misfortune and fortune alternate like winter and summer—
who knows their ultimate measure?

*"**Yíng** (盈) and **Xū** (虚), **xiāoxì** (消息)—
when things reach their extreme,
they must change—
there is no fixed **Zhèng** (正) or **Yé** (邪).*

*"The **Dao** of Heaven has no constant form—
this is the language of doubt and verification.*

**Yǔ** (禹) ascended the **Lù Dì** (陆帝) throne with **Zhèng** (正) governance,
yet his descendants did not follow it.
The **Huángtiān** (皇天) sent calamity,
and through **Táng** (汤), it corrected **Zhèng** (正) with *Qí* (奇).

**Táng** (汤) waged war because of **Gě Bó** (葛伯)’s failure to worship,
yet his guilt surpassed that of **Jié** (桀),
and through **Zhōu** (周), **Shàn** (善) became *Yāo* (妖).
The people’s confusion is indeed long-standing.

*"To know preservation yet not know destruction,
to know gain yet not know loss—
this has been the case from ancient times."*

The **Square** (方), the **Comfortable** (康), the **Straight** (直), the **Luminous** (光)—
these are the inner virtues.

To **not** cut (割), **not** wound (創), **not** overreach (肆), **not** dazzle (耀)—
these are the outer restraints.

The Sage cultivates the inner and neglects the outer,
thus being square yet **not** harsh (割),
comfortable yet **not** excessive (劇),
straight yet **not** overbearing (肆),
luminous yet **not** blinding (耀).

Rectify what lies within yourself,
and what lies without will rectify itself.
What then is this so-called *Qí* (奇) or *Yāo* (妖)?

**Volume Three of the *Original Meaning of the Mysterious Dao Classic* concludes.**
**Volume Four of the *Original Meaning of the Mysterious Dao Classic*:**
**Du Daojian’s High Daoist Teachings on the Path**

The *Classic* says:
*"To govern people and serve Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality (啬).*
*Only frugality is called early cultivation (早服).*
*Early cultivation is called the accumulation of profound virtue (重积德).*
*Profound virtue accumulated—there is nothing it cannot overcome (无不克).*
*Nothing it cannot overcome—its limits are unknown (莫知其极).*
*When its limits are unknown, one can have a realm (有国).*
*The mother of having a realm—this is the Dao of enduring roots and lasting life (长生久视)."*

*The Original Meaning says:*
*"To govern people is to nourish their exterior (外).*
*Knowing what the body should nourish, one knows what people and all things should nourish.*
*To serve Heaven is to nourish the interior (内).*
*Knowing what the heart should nourish, one knows what spirit (精) should nourish.*
*All that Heaven bestows within us—none should be neglected in nourishment.*
*The way of nourishment is none other than *yin* (音).*
*Frugality (啬) is the preservation of love (保爱).*
*Only *yin*—this is called early cultivation (早服).*
*Diligent cultivation is the method of nourishment.*
*Early cultivation is called the accumulation of profound virtue (重积德).*
*Only by diligently cultivating what should be nourished does virtue accumulate deeply (积德斯厚).*
*Profound virtue accumulated—there is nothing it cannot overcome (无不克).*
*Virtue being profound, the functions of inner and outer nourishment are fulfilled.*
*When people receive their nourishment, even the perilous become secure (危者安).*
*When Heaven receives its nourishment, even the subtle becomes manifest (微者明).*
*Nothing it cannot overcome—its limits are unknown (莫知其极).*
*Only the refined and singular (精一) resides therein.*
*When its limits are unknown, thus one can have a realm (有国)—*
*a realm is like the body (国犹身).*
*What the body should nourish, the realm should nourish.*
*The mother of having a realm—this is the Dao of enduring roots and lasting life (长生久视).*
*The mother is the Dao (母，道也).*
*To govern people with Dao—then the realm flourishes (国昌).*
*To serve Heaven with Dao—then the body is at ease (身康).*
*When the realm flourishes and the body is at ease, enduring longevity is preserved (久长可保).*
*This is called the Dao of enduring roots and lasting life (长生久视).*
*The realm’s root is its people (民), the body’s root is the heart (心).*
*Deep roots make the people secure, firm roots make the spirit secure.*
*When the people are secure, the realm cannot fail to endure (无不长).*
*When the spirit is secure, the body cannot fail to last (无不久)."*

*The Laozi’s governance of people and service to Heaven,*
*recorded in prayers to Heaven and seeking life—*
*these are one and the same.*

The *Classic* says:
*"To govern a great realm, treat it as if boiling a small fish (小鲜).*
*One who rules the world with the Dao—its spirits are not formidable (不神).*
*Not that its spirits are not formidable—*
*its spirits do not harm people.*
*Not that its spirits do not harm people—*
*the Sage also does not harm people.*
*When neither harms the other, virtue returns in exchange (德交归)."*

*The Original Meaning says:*
*"To govern a great realm, treat it as if boiling a small fish (小鲜).*
*A small fish (鲜)—a tiny fish.*
*Boiling a tiny fish—disturb it and it disintegrates, overheat it and it disintegrates; there is a middle way (中道).*
*A great realm is one that possesses the world (天下).*
*The people are like the tiny fish.*
*Governance is like the fire—disturb it and it is damaged, overburden it and it is damaged.*
*One who rules the world with the Dao—its spirits are not formidable (不神).*
*Ghosts and spirits—these are the *qi* of Heaven and Earth, the yin and yang forces.*
*Heaven and Earth have ghosts and spirits, just as a realm has ministers and assistants.*
*One who rules the world with the Dao—*
*The Sage does nothing above, the worthy act below.*
*When above and below are not in discord, their Dao is unerring,*
*then yin and yang *qi* do not stray, and calamities do not arise—*
*thus its spirits are not formidable (不神).*
*The harmonizing function is evident:*
*When the sun shines, it shines; when it rains, it rains.*
*People suffer no illness, things bear no blemish.*
*Five grains ripen, and the people thrive.*
*Its spirits also do not harm people (不伤人).*
*Its spirits do not harm people—*
*The Dao is at peace, the times are prosperous, things abound, the people are rich.*
*Below, there are regular tributes; above, there are no oppressive taxes.*
*The Sage also does not harm people (不伤人).*
*Ah! The people are Heaven’s cherished children (赤子),*
*The ruler is Heaven’s eldest child (元子).*
*The eldest is the longest in virtue (善之长).*
*If the eldest does not harm the young, Heaven will surely aid them—*
*this is called neither harming the other, thus virtue returns in exchange (德交归).*
*By this, it is seen that Heaven has no favorites—*
*only virtue does it assist."*

The *Classic* says:
*"A great realm is the confluence (下流), the intersection of the world (天下之交),*
*the world’s intersection is the receptive (牝).*
*The receptive ever conquers the assertive (牡) through stillness (静),*
*and stillness is the lowly (下).*
*Thus, when a great realm humbles itself to a small realm, it takes the small realm.*
*When a small realm humbles itself to a great realm, it takes the great realm.*
*Thus, sometimes one humbles to take, sometimes one humbles and takes.*
*A great realm seeks only to shelter people,*
*A small realm seeks only to submit to service.*
*Both obtain what they desire, thus the great should properly humble itself."*

*The Original Meaning says:*
*"A great realm is the confluence (下流), the intersection of the world (天下之交)—*
*like when Duke Xuan of Qi asked Mencius about the exchange between neighboring realms (交邻国).*
*A great realm to a small realm is like the sea to rivers—*
*when the great is lowly, the small will return to it.*
*Thus, a great realm must practice humility well,*
*then it can communicate with all small realms of the world.*
*It is like the world’s intersection being receptive (牝)—*
*The receptive ever conquers the assertive (牡) through stillness (静),*
*The receptive is lowly through stillness—*
*when a great realm is both humbly lowly and governs with stillness,*
*like the receptive subduing the assertive through stillness,*
*then the small realms will not need to be subdued by force but will return on their own.*
*Thus, when a great realm humbles itself to a small realm, it takes the small realm.*
*Only the virtuous can govern the great to serve the small—*
*thus Tang served Ge, and King Wen served Kunyi.*
*When a small realm humbles itself to a great realm, it takes the great realm.*
*Only the wise can govern the small to serve the great—*
*thus the Great King served the Xirong, and Goujian served Wu."*

「Thus, when a realm humbles itself to take others, yet governs the great to serve the small, it is one who rejoices in the Dao/Way (乐天者).
When a realm humbles itself and yet takes others, yet governs the small to serve the great, it is one who fears the Dao/Way (畏天者).

A great realm seeks only to encompass and nourish (兼畜) all under heaven—
the one who rejoices in the Dao/Way preserves the world.
A small realm seeks only to submit and serve others—
the one who fears the Dao/Way preserves its own land.
Both attain what they desire,
exchanging mutual sustenance (交相养) and finding harmony (得其宜),
like mountains and valleys to grasses and trees (草木),
when they do not sharply distinguish between the high and the low (不锐上丰下),
then they honor the roots while slighting the branches (则重本轻末).
For the great, when they dwell in humility (处下),
the small will find no realm they cannot bear and contain (容载).
When the small flourish and spread their virtue (敷荣),
the great will find no realm that is not abundantly prosperous (富庶).
Thus, the great ought to dwell in humility (为下).

When Confucius saw Laozi,
and afterward Mencius emerged,
was there not one who gained wisdom from what they saw and heard?
The *Classics* say:
*The Dao/Way is the hidden mystery (奥) of all things,*
*a treasure for the virtuous (善人之宝),*
*a safeguard for the unvirtuous (不善人之所保).*
*Fine words can be used to trade (市),*
*noble deeds can elevate a person (加人).*
*Though people may be unvirtuous, why should they be abandoned?*
Thus, when establishing a Son of Heaven (天子) and appointing the Three Exalted Ministers (三公),
even if one offers a jade tablet with four horses,
it is not as valuable as simply sitting and imparting this Dao/Way.
This is why the ancients held this Dao/Way in such esteem—
was it not because seeking it brings reward (有所得),
and possessing it exempts one from blame (有罪以免)?

Thus, it is the most precious for all under heaven.
The *Original Meaning* says:
*The Dao/Way encompasses Heaven and Earth,*
*concealing and nurturing all things,*
*like a household’s inner chambers (阃奥).*
*When the virtuous obtain it, they can make it a treasure for themselves.*
*When the unvirtuous obtain it, they can make it a safeguard for themselves.*
*Fine words can be used to trade,*
*like Yao’s admonition to Shun: “Consider the matter well.”*
*Noble deeds can elevate a person,*
*as when you ascended to the imperial throne (汝陟帝位者).*
*Fine words and noble deeds are the Dao/Way manifested externally (发于外者),*
*yet even these can be used to trade and elevate—*
*how much more so when the Dao/Way is preserved within!*
*Though people may be unvirtuous, why should they be abandoned?*
*The Book of Documents* says:
*“To know people is wisdom (哲),*
*to appoint them properly is governance (官人).*
*To settle the people is benevolence (惠),*
*and the common folk will cherish you (黎民怀之).”*
*If one is wise and benevolent,*
*why fear the treachery of Huan Dou (欢兜),*
*why be exiled by the Youmiao (有苗),*
*why dread the deceitful tongues and pleasing appearances of Gong Ren (孔壬)?*

*Observe Yao’s words “Ah!” and “Alas!” (曰吁曰佛),*
*and the wickedness of the Four Tyrants (四凶) was known*
*even without Shun’s judgment.*
*Yet, when their wickedness was proclaimed (声其不善),*
*Yao did not immediately punish them (不即罪),*
*which shows his imperial virtue (帝德) was broad and far-reaching,*
*his benevolence as vast as Heaven (其仁如天),*
*and he did not lightly take life (不轻杀戮).*

Thus, when establishing a Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Exalted Ministers,
the Son of Heaven acts as father and mother to the people (作民父母),
the Three Exalted Ministers discuss the Dao/Way and govern the realm (论道经邦),
they harmonize (燮) the principles of yin and yang,
assist in the transformation and nurturing of all things (赞化育),
settle the people, and preserve the world.
*The Book of Documents* says:
*“Do not neglect the officials of the people (无旷庶官),*
*for the work of Heaven, let man take its place (天工人其代之).”*
*Beyond this, inspect the four directions (巡四岳),*
*audience the feudal lords (朝诸侯),*
*though one may have the honor of a jade tablet with four horses,*
*or the splendor of a chariot with four horses,*
*these are but external matters (外物),*
*far less valuable than humbling oneself and facing south,*
*sitting to impart this Dao/Way,*
*and letting all under heaven govern itself (自治).*

This is why the ancients held this Dao/Way in such esteem—
was it not for this reason?
It is not merely that seeking it brings reward,
and possessing it exempts one from blame.
Thus, it is the most precious for all under heaven.

When the people are ignorant and misguided (昏垫),
and unfortunately bear the guilt of wickedness (有不善之罪),
then the ruler laments and pities them, saying:
*“I am the one who wronged them.”*
*“Yea” (耶) is an uncertain word.*
*This is not to condone their wickedness,*
*but to recognize that those who carry out punishments (自有司杀者) exist.*
*Thus, he holds the left contract (执左契) and does not blame the people,*
*using this virtue of cherishing life (好生之德)*
*to win the hearts of the people (洽于民心).*
*If one were like Yao, they could be called*
*the most precious for all under heaven and all ages.*

The *Classics* say:
*“To act without action (无为),*
*to govern without governance (无事),*
*to savor without savoring (无味).*
*Great or small, many or few,*
*repay resentment with virtue (报怨以德).*
*Plan for difficulty in its ease (图难於其易),*
*achieve greatness in its smallness (为大於其细).*
*The most difficult matters in the world,*
*must be begun in ease (必作於易).*
*The greatest affairs in the world,*
*must be begun in smallness (必作於细).*
*Thus, the Sage never strives for the great,*
*and so can achieve the great.*

*He who makes light of promises,*
*will be few in his trustworthiness (寡信).*
*He who is prone to change,*
*will encounter many difficulties (多难).*
*Thus, the Sage still finds difficulty,*
*and so never faces difficulty.*

The *Original Meaning* says:
*The aged Sage (老圣) sighed at the corruption of the Dao/Way,*
*that the clever and deceitful (智诈) deceived one another,*
*leading to chaos (为乱),*
*and there was no way to restore the hearts of the people (无以挽回人心).*
*Thus, he expounded the ancient Way of non-action (敷迷上古无为之化),*
*to instruct posterity (诏后世),*
*to turn the shallow and deceptive (锲薄) winds of the age*
*into the pure and thick (淳厚) qi of virtue,*
*and to rely on the Dao/Way.*

*Thus, to act without action is to follow nature (法自然).*
*To govern without governance is to align with Heaven’s principles (顺天理).*
*To savor without savoring is to delight in simplicity (乐恬淡).*
*Great or small, many or few—*
*all are contained within the relations of lord and subject, ruler and common folk (君臣民庶在焉).*
*To repay resentment with virtue,*
*when there is interaction between the high and the low (上下之交),*
*if there is wickedness, then one should repay it with virtue as their heart.*
*As it says: “I treat the good with goodness, and the wicked also with goodness.”*

*Plan for difficulty in its ease,*
*achieve greatness in its smallness—*
*one’s schemes must be cautious from the beginning (谨始),*
*and not allow difficulties to grow unchecked (无使滋蔓难图).*
*The most difficult matters in the world,*
*must be begun in ease (必作於易).*
*The greatest affairs in the world,*
*must be begun in smallness (必作於细).*
*This is the principle of things (物理所在).*
*From the subtle to the manifest (从微至着),*
*like the easy reversals of the *I Ching* (易之不远复),*
*without regret or remorse (无祇悔),*
*from one yang to two yangs (一阳二阳),*
*accumulating to become the *Qian* (乾).*
*Thus, the Sage never strives for the great,*
*and so can achieve the great.*

*The Sage has the virtue of *Qian* (六阳之德),*
*not making themselves great,*
*yet achieving greatness.*

*He who makes light of promises,*
*will be few in his trustworthiness.*
*He who is prone to change,*
*will encounter many difficulties.*
*The hearts of people are shallow and fickle (浇薄),*
*often behaving thus.*
*Few begin with good intentions,*
*fewer still see them through (鲜克有终).*
*Thus, the Sage finds difficulty in the beginning.*
*The Sage’s heart,*
*worries before the world’s worries (先天下之忧而忧),*
*and rejoices after the world’s rejoicings (后天下之乐而乐).*
*This is the one who has both beginning and end (有始有卒).*
*Only because the Sage finds difficulty in the beginning,*
*do they never face difficulty in the end.*

The *Classics* say:
*“Its stability is easy to maintain,*
*its early signs are easy to plan against.*
*Its fragility is easy to shatter,*
*its subtlety is easy to disperse.”*

「To act before things exist,
And govern before chaos arises.
A tree as thick as a man can embrace,
Grows from a tiny sprout.
A nine-tiered terrace,
Rises from a pile of earth.
A journey of a thousand *li*,
Begins beneath one’s feet.

The doer invites ruin,
The grasping one invites loss.
Thus, the Sage acts without doing—no ruin;
Holds without grasping—no loss.

The people’s undertakings,
Often falter as they near completion.
To guard the end as the beginning,
Then no matter will fail.

Therefore, the Sage desires without desiring,
Does not prize hard-to-obtain goods.
Learns without learning,
Reversing the errors of the multitude.
To aid the natural flourishing of all things,
And dare not act.

*The Original Meaning* says:
*“Its stability is easy to maintain,”*
This follows the previous chapter’s intent,
Speaking of the principles of all things under Heaven.
To preserve their completion,
One must be cautious at their outset.
In times of peace and tranquility,
Guard against reckless action—
Then stability is easy to uphold.
Like planning before a matter takes shape,
Breaking what is brittle,
Dispersing what is subtle.

To act before things exist,
Is not to force existence—
This is how to prevent ruin before it begins.
To govern before chaos arises,
Is not to force order—
This is how to settle and restrain before disorder takes hold.

Thus, it is likened to a tree’s growth from a sprout,
A terrace’s rise from a pile of earth,
A journey’s start from one’s feet.
At their beginning, their signs are most faint,
Yet when they reach their end,
The tree is as thick as an embrace,
The terrace stands nine layers high,
The journey spans a thousand *li*.

Is this not the work of many years?
Their beginnings must not be neglected.

In all matters under Heaven,
Once one’s heart turns to action,
Defeat often follows.
To exert force and grasp,
Loss and regret often ensue.
What one undertakes with all one’s strength,
Will later bring misfortune.

Thus, the Sage does without forcing—
No ruin in undertakings.
Does not cling to rigidity—
No loss or regret.

The common people are otherwise.
Their undertakings,
Often falter as they near completion,
For they have not heard the Way of maintaining stability.
To guard the end as the beginning,
Then no matter will fail—
Only the Sage can achieve this.
Therefore, the Sage, like King Wen,
Held two-thirds of the realm under Heaven,
Yet served the Shang dynasty—
This shows their desire without desiring,
Their disregard for hard-to-obtain treasures.

To view the people as wounded,
To gaze upon the Dao yet not see it—
This shows their learning without learning,
Reversing the errors of the multitude.

But to aid the natural flourishing of all things,
And dare not act—
In the end, this is simply non-action.

Thus it is said:
“With King Ji as father,
And King Wu as son,
The Sage without worries—
Is this not King Wen?”

*The Classics* say:
“Ancient masters of the Dao,
Did not enlighten the people,
But rather sought to befuddle them.
The people’s difficulty in governance,
Arises from their excess of cleverness.
Thus, to govern with cleverness,
Is the thief of the state.
To govern without cleverness,
Is the state’s blessing.
Knowing these two truths,
Is the model for governance.
To always know the model,
Is called the Mysterious Virtue.
The Mysterious Virtue is profound and distant,
Opposed to things—
Only then does one reach the Great Harmony.

*The Original Meaning* says:
“Ancient masters of the Dao,
Like Yao’s governance of the world,
Where the people neither recognized nor knew—
Was this not to enlighten them,
But rather to befuddle them?

Why so?
The ruler governed with non-action,
Letting the people follow without knowing—
This was the state’s blessing.
The people’s difficulty in governance,
Came from the ruler’s stimulation of their cleverness.

Man possesses five natures,
All bestowed by Heaven,
None without natural principles,
Just as Heaven has the Five Phases.
Spring nurtures *ren*,
Summer fosters *li*,
Autumn fulfills *yi*,
Winter conceals *zhi*,
And *xin* flows through all four seasons.
Thus, the cold and heat regulate the seasons,
And floods and droughts do not occur,
Defects and diseases do not arise,
And all things flourish.

To govern the people as if holding their fate,
Yet unaware of *ren*’s springing,
*Li*’s growth,
*Yi*’s fulfillment,
And only valuing *zhi*’s concealment—
Then the year is always winter,
And all things are stored yet not born.

Can this be called a year?
A year of constant winter,
And all things stored yet not born—
Governance that favors cleverness,
Is only hoarding and not knowing release.
Can this be called governance?

It is better to have thieving ministers
Than ministers of hoarding.
Thus, to govern with cleverness,
Is to rob one’s people,
And thereby rob one’s state.
To govern without cleverness,
Is to bless one’s people,
And thereby bless one’s state.
Knowing these two truths,
Is the model for governance.
To always know the model,
And not exalt cleverness—
Then blessings extend to the state,
This is called the Mysterious Virtue.

The Mysterious Virtue,
Is to aid the natural flourishing of things,
And not to enlighten the people.
The Mysterious Virtue is profound and distant,
Opposed to things—
This speaks of its difference from governance through cleverness.
To govern without cleverness,
Only then does one reach the Great Harmony.
Great Harmony means all things fulfill their nature of growth and completion.

*The Classics* say:
“Rivers and seas become kings of all valleys
Because they excel in yielding.
Thus, the Sage desires to be above others,
By speaking from below.
To be first among others,
By placing themselves last.
Thus, the Sage, though in high position,
Does not burden the people,
Though in front,
Does not harm the people.
Thus, all under Heaven gladly follow,
And never tire—
Because they do not contend,
No one under Heaven can contend with them.

*The Original Meaning* says:
“Rivers and seas become kings of all valleys
Because they excel in yielding.
This ties together the meaning of the previous chapters.
Rivers and seas excel in yielding,
Thus they become kings of all valleys.
Therefore, the Sage follows the Way of yielding,
And does not desire to be above others.
Yet, when necessity compels them to be above others,
They say:
‘To desire to be above others,
By speaking from below.’
Though in high position,
Their words remain humble.”

The Sage does not contend—
Is this not the meaning of *humble reception and benefit*?

Though their name may come first,
Their person follows behind.
Yet there are those who push forward and take precedence.
Only because they can yield and follow,
The Sage, though in high position, does not burden the people—
Not because they seek to exalt themselves.
Though in front, they do not harm the people—
Not because they seek to obstruct others.
Only because they do not burden or harm,
All under Heaven gladly follow without tiring of their being above or first.

Why is this?
Because they do not contend with the people for high position or precedence,
Thus no one under Heaven can bear to contend with them.

*The Mysterious Classic* states:
When speaking of cultivating oneself,
The governance of family and state is included.
When speaking of governing the state and family,
Cultivating oneself is included.
The wise observer will surely grasp the deeper meaning beyond the words.

*The Classic* says:
All under Heaven say my Dao is vast yet seems unworthy.
Only because it is vast does it seem unworthy.
If it were worthy for long, it would be trifling.
I possess three treasures; I guard and hold them:
First, *compassion*;
Second, *frugality*;
Third, *not daring to be first under Heaven*.

Compassion makes one courageous.
Frugality makes one abundant.
Not daring to be first under Heaven makes one a vessel of excellence and leader.

Now they abandon compassion and seek courage,
Abandon frugality and seek abundance,
Abandon yielding and seek precedence—
They are doomed.

Compassion means victory in war and steadfastness in defense.
Heaven aids them, shielding them with compassion.

*The Original Meaning* says:
The Sage’s Dao is not the *Wuwei* of ancient antiquity,
Nor the harmonious Way of Tang and Yu.
Its greatness is formless—
It cannot be sought through names or speech.
Few common people recognize it,
Thus it is said: *All under Heaven say my Dao is vast yet seems unworthy.*
Meaning it is beyond comparison.

Only because it is vast does it seem unworthy.
If it were worthy for long, it would be trifling—
Self-explanatory words, like saying:
*Only Heaven is great; only Yao followed it—*
Who could truly emulate it?

As for Yu’s leveling the earth and completing Heaven’s work,
That can be traced and followed.

The Sage laments that all under Heaven say my Dao is vast yet seems unworthy,
So he further explains the lesser aspects:
I have three treasures; I guard and hold them.
Guard and hold means to cherish and preserve them.
First, *compassion*—not daring to slaughter Heaven’s people wantonly.
Second, *frugality*—not daring to waste Heaven’s resources recklessly.
Third, *not daring to be first under Heaven*—not daring to initiate Heaven’s punishments.

Compassion makes one courageous—
Returning victorious, the troops dance with dry reeds, and the people rally.
Frugality makes one abundant—
Wearing simple garments to honor the spirits,
Building low halls to invest in canals and dikes.
Not daring to be first under Heaven makes one a vessel of excellence and leader.

Shun appointed Zongzhen as his teacher, then promoted Gao Yao,
Saying: *“Let me abdicate.”*
The ministers refused, so he yielded.
Thus, the ancients who practiced this were like Yu.

Now they abandon compassion and seek courage—
Thus they slaughtered Long Fang and Bi Gan.
Abandon frugality and seek abundance—
Thus they built tilted palaces of jade and yew,
Chambers of gemstone and pearl gates.
Abandon yielding and seek precedence—
Thus they imprisoned Tang on the Southern Mound and at Youli,
And met their doom at Nanhuo and Muyewild.
The ancients who practiced this were like Jie and Zhou.

Compassion means victory in war—
The benevolent are invincible—
And steadfastness in defense.
The people would die for them without hesitation.
Heaven aids them, shielding them with compassion.
Thus they escaped the calamities of the Southern Mound and Youli.
The ancients who practiced this were like Tang and Wen.

When Tang overthrew Jie, he said:
*“In ancient Xia, the rulers and their successors flourished in virtue,
And there were no Heavenly calamities.
Mountains, rivers, ghosts, and spirits—
All were at peace.
Even birds, beasts, fish, and tortoises thrived.
But their descendants did not follow this.
Heaven sent disaster,
And entrusted it to me by decree.”*

When Zhou attacked Zhou, they said:
*“Only the wicked have no remorse.
They dwell in arrogance,
Do not sacrifice to Heaven or the spirits,
And abandon their ancestral temples.
The crimes of Shang are complete—
Heaven’s mandate punishes them.”*

This is what is meant by *worthy*.
Tang and Wu could not be the rulers of Yao and Shun—
Their lesser status is clear.

*The Classic* says:
The skilled warrior does not rely on force,
The skilled fighter does not rage,
The skilled victor does not contend,
The skilled leader serves below.

This is called the *virtue of non-contention*,
This is called the *power of using people*,
This is called *harmonizing with Heaven*—
The ultimate of the ancients.

*The Original Meaning* says:
The ancients skilled in being a warrior did not rely on force—
Was it not Wen Wang?
Imprisoned at Youli, he was betrayed by Chonghou Hu.
Wen Wang received the Mandate,
And after six years, he attacked Chong.
The skilled fighter does not rage—
Chonghou Hu advised Zhou,
Who offered the western lands of Luo and red-soil fields a thousand *li* to Zhou,
Asked to abolish the *pao-lao* torture,
And was granted bows, arrows, axes, and iron,
Thus gaining control over military campaigns as *Xiber*,
Overseeing the southern states of Jiang, Han, and Ru,
And the surrounding vassals.

The skilled victor does not contend—
Lü Shang, a man from the Eastern Sea,
Met over seventy rulers without being heard,
And people called him a madman.
Fishing at Weiyang,
Xiber labored and questioned him:
*“Do you take pleasure in fishing?”*
Lü Shang replied:
*“The noble takes pleasure in their aspirations,
The petty in their deeds.
I fish not for pleasure.”*
Xiber spoke with him and was greatly delighted,
Saying: *“My ancestor, Taigong, has long awaited you.”*
Thus he was called *Taigong Wang*,
And appointed as teacher.

The skilled leader serves below—
As in the *Four Virtues* described above—
This is called the *virtue of non-contention*,
This is called the *power of using people*,
This is called *harmonizing with Heaven*—
The ultimate of the ancients.

*Harmonizing with Heaven* means:
It is the ultimate standard for rulers.

As for the **Wen Wang**—he was indeed the finest exemplar of a scholar-official in antiquity, worthy of being a model for all under Heaven and future generations.

In days past, **Xī Bó** once asked **Taigong**,
*“The Shang king’s crimes kill the innocent—will you aid me in my distress?”*
Taigong replied:
*“The Dao of Heaven brings no calamity—one must not act first.
The Dao of humanity brings no calamity—one must not plot first.”*

Again he asked:
*“When a ruler’s actions and undertakings invite calamity or divine retribution, how does this manifest?”*
Taigong said:
*“Heavy taxation and lavish palaces bring widespread sickness and pestilence.
Frost and dew destroy the five grains, and silk and hemp fail to mature.
Excessive hunting and fowling, disregarding seasonal prohibitions, bring frequent great winds, and the grains bear no fruit.
Desecrating sacred mountains and damming great rivers brings frequent great floods.
Pursuing warfare without cease brings eclipses of the sun and moon, and the White Star strays from its course.”*

**Xī Bó** said, *“Truly so. Within no more than ten years, Shang perished, and all under Heaven turned to Zhou—this too is the proof of benevolent frugality and not acting first.”*

The **Classic** says:
*“In war, there is a saying: I dare not be the aggressor, but only the defender.
I dare not advance even an inch, but retreat a foot.
This is called *‘having no march’*—
*‘no arms’*—*‘no enemy’*—*‘no weapons.’*
No greater calamity exists than contempt for the enemy—
contempt for the enemy nearly loses my treasure.”*

Thus, when armies clash, the one who first yields will win.

The **Original Meaning** says:
*“Warfare is meant to guard against unforeseen threats, not to threaten all under Heaven.
In war, there is a saying—quoting ancient military doctrine, as follows:
The side that strikes first is the aggressor; the side that responds is the defender.
I dare not be the aggressor, nor dare I strike first to threaten all under Heaven.
But if I am the defender, and the enemy does not provoke me, I must respond only when forced—this is guarding against the unforeseen.
Even when forced to respond, I still dare not advance an inch to contempt the enemy;
rather, I retreat a foot to fortify my defense.
This is called *‘having no march.’*
*March* refers to leading an army—
*‘no march’* means having no aggressive intent, though the army moves, it does not advance lightly.

*‘No arms’*—*‘arms’* means defense—
*‘no arms’* means having no intent to strike, though defending, one does not lightly raise a hand.

*‘No enemy’*—*‘enemy’* means to provoke—
*‘no enemy’* means having no intent to provoke, though engaging in battle, one does not lightly confront the enemy.

*‘No weapons’*—*‘weapons’* are instruments of slaughter—
Though wielding instruments of slaughter, one does not resort to killing.
Why? No greater calamity exists than contempt for the enemy.

The feudal lords treat their states as their hearts—
thus, they cannot always avoid being the first to strike.
The Son of Heaven treats all under Heaven as his heart—
these are my people, those are also my people—
harming them is harming myself.
How could I lightly contempt the enemy?

This is why **Yú** bowed to **Chang’s** words and recalled his armies,
so that the **Miao people** submitted in peace.

Alas, contempt for the enemy nearly loses my treasure—
*‘treasure’* refers to the *three treasures* of the previous chapter:
the true treasure is virtue, and kindness and kinship are the treasures.
Thus, all under Heaven’s people are my treasures.
Therefore, when armies clash, the compassionate will prevail.
For when two armies face each other, if one is moved by pity and spares life,
the hearts of the people will be revealed—
without battle, their armies will yield, and victory is assured.”

This concludes the meaning of the two preceding chapters.
The previous chapter praised **Wen Wang** for his non-martial virtue,
while subtly restraining the intent toward **Wū Wáng**.

The sages, both ancient and modern, often cite warfare,
taking **Yú’s** pacification of the **Miao** as their model.

The **Classic** says:
*“My words are very easy to know,
very easy to practice.
Yet none under Heaven can know them,
none can practice them.
Words have their roots, deeds have their lords.
It is only because of ignorance
that they do not know me.
Few know me—
thus, I am precious.
Therefore, the sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade.
Some manuscripts read: *‘None know me.’*”*

The **Original Intent** states:
*"Words are the means to bear the Dao.
Knowledge is knowing the Dao; practice is walking the Dao.
Very easy to know, very easy to practice—
I have no hidden meaning for you.
To walk it is to find harmony on all sides,
Yet none under Heaven can know or practice it—
Ah, what a lament!
Words have their roots, deeds have their lords.
Words with roots are all drawn from the ancient texts of *Fen* and *Dian*,
And deeds with lords are all grounded in the Emperor’s Way.
How could this be mere empty speech?
To not know words is to not know the Dao—
Thus, they do not know me.
Since they cannot know, nor can they practice,
Their lack of knowledge is evident.
Only because of ignorance
Are those who know me few—
This is not surprising.
Alas, few know me,
So I am precious—
Or as some say, *‘the law.’*
My Dao is taken from the Dao,
Thus I am precious.

The **Original Intent** says:
Knowledge is knowing the Dao;
Ignorance is not knowing the Dao.
To know while not speaking is exalted;
To speak while not knowing is folly.
Only those who scorn folly
Do so because they are not folly.
The sage is not folly,
Because the sage scorns folly—
Thus, the sage is not folly.
*(The Classic says: To know while not speaking is exalted;
To speak while not knowing is folly.
Only those who scorn folly
Do so because they are not folly.
The sage is not folly,
Because the sage scorns folly—
Thus, the sage is not folly.)*
The **Original Intent** says:
The sage knows without error, acts without error—
Who would regret this?

In ancient Zhou, there stood a bronze man,
With three sealed mouths and inscriptions on his back.
When the sage was in Zhou,
Surely the bronze man was made—
Yet Confucius, upon seeing Zhou,
Had once been deceived by touching it.
The previous chapter said:
‘Very easy to know, very easy to practice—
Yet none under Heaven can know or practice it.’
This chapter speaks of:
‘To know while not speaking is exalted;
To speak while not knowing is folly.’
Does the Dao truly remain unknowable forever?
To know is to know, to not know is to not know—
This is knowing.

The **Classic** says:
*"If the people do not fear punishment,
Then the greatest punishment has arrived.
Do not narrow their dwelling,
Do not weary their birth.
Only because of not wearying
Is it that they do not weary me.
Thus, the sage knows himself but does not reveal himself,
Loves himself but does not exalt himself—
Hence, he discards that and takes this."*

The **Original Intent** says:
Punishment is the law.
The people value their bodies,
Yet when punishment is added—
Who does not know to fear?
Yet there are those who disregard the axe and the blade,
And transgress against it—
Why?
Because the greatest punishment has arrived.
They know they have no escape,
And even the lowly fear suffering—
How much more those of great strength!
Tang left Xia’s net of three sides—
This was well-founded.
The southern lords of Han heard it say:
‘Tang’s virtue extended even to birds and beasts—
Forty states submitted to him.’
Alas, Jie was a ruler,
Tang was a subject.
To comfort me is to be my successor,
To oppress me is to be my enemy—
The heart of the great man,
How could it be narrow?
If narrow, then there are things it cannot contain,
And it monopolizes blessings and imposes punishments—
Reaching everywhere, none can endure.
If the people cannot endure,
Then subjects kill their rulers,
Sons kill their fathers—
Surely there are those it cannot contain.
This is why Jie perished
And Tang rose.
Do not narrow their dwelling—
Their dwelling is the heart.
A heart not narrow is where spirit and clarity reside,
And all things are contained within the Way of life.
Do not weary their birth—
Their birth is both inner spirit and clarity,
And outer people and things—
All must not be weary.
If weary, then the heart will abandon me—
This is the Way of life and death.
Only because of not wearying
Do I not weary them.
Thus, they do not weary me.
The sage knows himself but does not reveal himself—
Without the heart of arrogating others.
Loves himself but does not exalt himself—
Without the heart of threatening others.
Hence, he discards that narrowness and weariness,
And takes this knowing and loving."*

The **Classic** says:
*"Courageous in daring brings death,
Courageous in not daring brings life.
These two paths—
One brings benefit, one brings harm.
What the heavens abhor,
Who knows their cause?
Thus, even the sage finds it difficult.
The Way of Heaven
Conquers without strife,
Responds without words,
Summons without calling.
It is tranquil yet ever-planning.
The Heavenly net is vast and wide,
Though sparse, it does not lose a single thread."*

The **Original Intent** says:
Courage is resolve;
Daring is *qi*.
Resolve reaches its end,
*Qi* follows next.
To hold resolve without unleashing *qi* is the Way of life.
If *qi* is one, then it moves;
If resolve moves and *qi* strays—
Then it is the Way of stumbling and death.
To know these two paths—
One brings benefit, one brings harm,
For resolve and *qi* are two things—
If their Way is mastered, then benefit.
If their Way is lost, then harm.
What the heavens abhor,
Who knows their cause?
This is the origin of abhorrence.
The heavens love life and abhor death—
Who can know the heavenly intent to abhor death
And not defy it?
Thus, even the sage finds it difficult.
The heavenly intent is unfathomable,
Yet the sage still considers it difficult,
And does not act with daring courage.
The Way of Heaven
Conquers without strife—
Softness overcomes hardness.
Responds without words—
Sincerity moves the spirit.

The Way does not summon yet comes of its own accord—
When one does good, a hundred blessings descend;
When one does evil, a hundred calamities descend.

Thus, when one is cautious yet skillful in counsel,
The Dao of Heaven rewards virtue and punishes licentiousness.

The Heavenly Net is vast and open,
Yet nothing escapes its grasp.

Heaven’s will is inscrutable,
Life’s decree is not constant—
If one’s virtue is constant,
One preserves one’s station.
If virtue is not constant,
The Nine Realms bring ruin.

For calamity and blessing have no gate—
Only the self invites them.

When Jie and Zhou ruled as tyrants,
Had they but appointed the worthy and heeded counsel,
Known Heaven’s abhorrence,
And not acted with reckless daring,
Even though they were cautious—
How could the sages Shang and Wu dare not submit?

Alas, how dire!
Was it not that Jie and Zhou brought ruin upon themselves?
Or was it the Heavenly Net’s vastness that never fails?

How the sage’s words cannot be defied!

The *Classic* says:
*"The people do not fear death—
How can you frighten them with death?"*

If one makes death a constant terror,
And those who act strangely are seized and killed—
Who would dare?

Only the proper officers should kill.
To usurp the role of the executioner
Is to usurp the place of the master carpenter in his craft.
To usurp the master carpenter’s chisel—
Few escape uninjured hands.

The *Original Meaning* says:
*"To cherish life and abhor death—
This is the common heart of all."*

The people do not fear death—
How can you frighten them with death?

This follows the previous chapter’s intent,
Lamenting that the Way of the King is not in action—
When the people do not die by war,
They die by famine—
Who kills them?

Yet laws are made strict,
Taxes and levies are multiplied,
The people are coerced by threats,
Driven to their deaths with no escape—
Not that they do not fear death,
But that they cannot avoid it.

Mencius said:
*"To kill with the blade or with governance—
This is the same intent."*

If the people do not fear death,
It means they cannot endure life,
And harbor a heart of equal indifference to death.

If the ruler relaxes laws,
Lightens taxes and labor,
Reduces burdens—
Then the people, each nourished in their place,
Would fear strange actions and unrest.

If the people are properly nourished,
Yet some still cause unrest—
Seize them and kill them as proper officers,
Place them under punishment—
This is Heaven’s killing.

Who dares say the people always fear death,
And dare not transgress?

The proper executioner is Heaven.
To usurp Heaven’s killing is to act as man.
To kill rightly is Heaven’s killing;
To kill wrongly is to kill as man—
How could it not injure?

Like the master carpenter’s craft—
To usurp the master’s chisel,
Few escape uninjured hands.
This illustrates killing by governance—
Truly, it is self-injury.

When the Zhou Dynasty moved east,
Authority fell to the feudal lords,
Who unilaterally waged war—
Like usurping the master’s chisel,
Not only did the proper order collapse,
But the armies of the feudal lords,
Ravaging a thousand *li*,
Slaughtered the people—
They had no time to fear death.

When Heaven’s decree overcame man,
Few did not fail—
This is the meaning of injury to the hands.

The *Classic* says:
*"The people’s hunger comes from their rulers’ excessive taxes—
Thus they hunger.
The people’s difficulty to govern comes from their rulers’ interference—
Thus they are difficult to govern.
The people’s indifference to death comes from their rulers’ excessive pursuit of life—
Thus they treat death lightly."*

Only those who do not cling to life
Are wiser than those who prize it.
The *Original Meaning* says:
*"The state depends on the people as its root,
The people depend on food as their heaven.
A state cannot exist without the people,
Just as the people cannot exist without food.
The people’s hunger comes from their rulers’ excessive taxes—
Thus they hunger.
In the late periods of the Three Dynasties,
The great granaries were alike.
Once, the Five Hegemons contended for power,
Imposing labor and warfare,
Unequal rewards and burdens,
Scarce state resources,
Fields left uncultivated,
Taxes uncollected—
And yet they increased levies.
This is why the people starved.
When starving, they stole and schemed without restraint—
Thus they were difficult to govern.
Not that the people were difficult to govern,
But because their rulers acted.
When rulers act, the people act in turn.
The people’s indifference to death comes from their rulers’ excessive pursuit of life.
Those who exhaust a nation’s people
To nourish their ears, eyes, noses, and mouths—
Their spirits do not permit it.
Their spirits not permitted,
Thus they treat death lightly.
Only those who do not cling to life
Are wiser than those who prize it.
Why?
Because nourishing life must first be rooted in substance—
Yet even with abundance, many fail to nourish themselves.
If the laws of a declining age are followed,
Even the sages would not adopt them."*

The *Classic* says:
*"When a person is born, they are soft and weak;
When they die, they become stiff and strong.
All things, grass and trees—
When they are born, they are soft and fragile;
When they die, they wither and decay.
Thus, the stiff and strong are the companions of death,
The soft and weak are the companions of life—
Hence, strong armies do not conquer,
Strong trees are easily split.
The strong and great are beneath,
The soft and weak are above."*

The *Original Meaning* says:
*"Death and life are profound.
The companions of life, the companions of death—
I have already spoken of their essence in *Entering and Exiting Death*.
Alas, when a person is born, they are soft and weak—
The soft and weak are the companions of life.
When they die, they become stiff and strong—
The stiff and strong are the companions of death.
Is it only for humans?
All things are the same.
Thus it is also said:
All things, grass and trees—
When they are born, they are soft and fragile;
When they die, they wither and decay.
Trace their origin in life and death—
It lies in the two *qi* of yin and yang.
The two *qi* originate from the One *Qi* of the Supreme Polarity,
The One *Qi* originates from the Boundless Void of the Great Emptiness.
The *Classic* says:
*The myriad things under Heaven are born from Being,
Being is born from Non-Being.*
In the *Yijing*, it says:
*The Great Polarity is born from the *Yi*,
From which the Two Complements arise.*
The *Yi* is without yet reaches the utmost of Being—
To know the *Yi* is without yet reaches the utmost of Being,
Is to know the *Yi* is Boundless.
The *Yi* has the Great Polarity—
How could it not be called Boundless and the Great Polarity?
The Great Polarity is the undifferentiated *qi* at the origin of things,
The Boundless is the formless Great Emptiness before the Great Polarity.
The Buddhist school says:
*All dharmas return to One,
One returns to where?*
It is also the saying:
Being is born from Non-Being,
And again returns to Non-Being."*

Thus, what is the role of those who follow life, and what of those who follow death? From the Great Polarity arise the Two Complements—*Qian* the firm, *Kun* the yielding—heaven and earth uniting in virtue.

*Qian* is heaven. Heaven’s One generates water: the father is firm, the child yielding, so water’s nature is soft and weak, its virtue to follow downward. Earth’s Two generates fire: the mother is yielding, the child firm, so fire’s nature is flaming upward, its virtue dry and hard.

Were it not for fire’s firmness, *Qian*’s vigorous body would not manifest. Were it not for water’s yielding, *Kun*’s accommodating function would not be fulfilled. Only through the interplay of firm and yielding does the enduring and vast virtue emerge.

In birth, the human is soft and weak—heaven’s water sustains it. In death, it becomes rigid and strong—earth’s fire reclaims it. Only when firm and yielding balance does the work of life and death complete itself, and thus the Dao of longevity and enduring vision lies within. Hence, the nurturers of life take this as their law.

The yielding and weak give life; the firm and strong bring death. Just as a strong army cannot prevail—it is attacked by many—so too a rigid tree is felled by many axes. The firm and great are lowly; the yielding and weak are exalted. This is the Way of Heaven.

The sages and the old masters say: yielding and weak preserve *qi*; firm and strong deplete the body. When *qi* is harmonious, life flourishes; when the body is robust, aging comes. Aging leads to death, and death must return to its source. To return to the infant state, to return to the Boundless—this is the Way of return.

The *Classic* says: The Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow. The high are lowered; the low are raised. The excessive are diminished; the deficient are supplemented. Heaven’s Way is to diminish the excessive and supplement the deficient. But the Way of humanity is otherwise: it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive. Who can serve the world with its excess? Only the Daoist.

Thus the sage acts without relying on it, achieves without claiming it, and does not seek to be seen as virtuous.

*The Original Meaning* says: In the *Hongfan*, the ninth category is *Huangji* (the Sovereign Polarity). The Sovereign establishes the Polarity, speaking of the central Way standing firm, its central path encompassing the nine categories.

The Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow. Using the analogy of drawing and releasing, the high are lowered, the low are raised—this is seen in the balance of high and low. The excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented—this is seen in the balance of great and small.

Earth’s *qi* ascends; heaven’s *qi* descends—this is the Way of lowering the high and raising the low. Extreme heat turns to cold; extreme cold turns to warmth—this is the Way of diminishing the excessive and supplementing the deficient. The Way of Heaven thus bends toward the middle, achieving harmony and establishing the positions of heaven and earth, nurturing all things.

But the Way of nurturing humanity is otherwise: it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive. Heaven’s nature and human desires are ever in opposition. The so-called gentleman practices the Mean; the petty man rejects it. Who can serve the world with its excess, as heaven’s clouds move and rain nourishes all things? Only the Daoist—this is the saying: *Virtue lies in good governance; governance lies in nurturing the people.*

The sage acts without presumption, expecting no reward. When the work is done, he does not dwell on it—this is the Way of Heaven. He does not seek to be seen as virtuous; he simply holds to the Mean.

The sage’s deeds are both action and non-action, encompassing heaven and earth. The common people do not recognize this.

Ah! The heavens’ burden is without sound or scent.

The *Classic* says: Under Heaven, nothing is softer and weaker than water. Yet nothing surpasses it in overcoming the firm and strong. There is no substitute for it. Thus, the yielding overcomes the firm; the weak overcomes the strong. All know this, yet none can practice it.

Hence the sage says: To bear the nation’s impurities is to be its sovereign. To bear the nation’s misfortunes is to be its king. His words seem inverted.

*The Original Meaning* says: Softness overcomes hardness; the female overcomes the male—this is the principle. No thing is softer and weaker than water, yet when it reaches its fullness, it breaches dams and floods rivers, and none can resist it.

The old sages pitied the decline of the Xia and Shang dynasties, fearing the rise of a second age of decline. Thus, through the question of Guan Yin, they admonished and rescued them, saying: All know this, yet none can practice it. Only Lord Yu attained it, using water to control water, leveling the earth so heaven’s order was fulfilled. King Tang attained it, conquering east and west, ever fearful of falling behind. The Western King attained it, subduing the barbarians and punishing the arrogant, yet none dared to rebel.

Is this not the very essence of how the soft overcomes the hard? Had Jie understood this, he might have governed like the sage-kings Yu and Tang, and never would Tang have conquered him. Had Zhou understood this, he might have learned from the fall of Xia, and never would Wu have overthrown him. But because of their rigid cruelty and stubborn ignorance, there arose ministers who usurped their thrones—how dire the consequence!

Thus the sages declared: To bear a nation’s calamities is to be its sovereign. To bear a nation’s misfortunes is to be its king over all. These are the words of the ancient sages. When Gun was drowned, when Tang and Wen were imprisoned, none suffered greater calamities than they. Yet when Yu received the Mandate of Heaven through abdication, when Tang and Wu seized power themselves, they became sovereigns and kings over all.

Alas! Jie and Zhou were indeed tyrants as rulers, while Tang and Wu were indeed sages as subjects. If Yu, through merit, received the Mandate peacefully, then no reproach attaches. But if Tang and Wu, through cunning and force, took the throne themselves, how could they avoid shame? Only King Wen, with his utmost reverence toward Zhou, never straying from propriety, could be compared in virtue to Yao and Shun.

The true intent of *The Mysterious Classic* is to admonish rulers: Rectify yourself, and you rectify the people. Rectify the people, and the realm’s order is fulfilled. How could a subject ever presume to replace his sovereign?

The proper relationship between ruler and subject: I, the people of the Yellow Emperor’s age, were unshackled by laws yet content with our food—coarse grains to eat, hollowed gourds to drink from, simple garments to wear, fur to ward off cold, and shelters of nests and caves to shield us from wind and rain. We took joy in our customs, cradling our infants and patting our bellies in contentment. Neighboring lands lay in sight, yet our paths never clashed. The sounds of roosters and dogs reached one another, yet all things flourished without harm. The people lived to old age without seeking one another’s company, knowing no desire to contest cities or lands. Heaven’s Way and Earth’s bounty were never wanting.

To ponder this passage: the ancient simplicity and purity still resonates through heaven and earth—just as it was then, so it remains now. Thus we know the sages’ wisdom was beyond the grasp of later-age tyrants.

What they called a "great sage encountered once in ten thousand years" is one whose understanding dawns as naturally as day follows night.

*The Classic* says:
*"Faithful words lack beauty; beautiful words lack truth.
The virtuous do not argue; those who argue lack virtue.
The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.
The sage does not hoard.
The more one gives to others, the more one possesses.
The more one shares with others, the more one has.
Heaven’s Way benefits without harming.
The sage’s Way acts without contention."*

*The Original Meaning* says:
The sage’s heart is the heart of heaven and earth—boundless in acceptance, boundless in giving. Like water poured in but never full, drawn upon but never exhausted.

But common people are otherwise:
Beautiful words lack truth, for they prize ornamentation.
Faithful words lack beauty, for the Way values simplicity.
The virtuous do not argue, for they embrace all without reservation.
Those who argue lack virtue, for they cling to words.
The wise are not learned, for they merge into oneness.
The learned are not wise, for they count without measure.
The sage does not hoard, for they align with the ebb and flow of time.
The more one gives to others, the more one possesses—
for the heart of nurturing life is ever-present.
The more one shares with others, the more one has—
for the heart of creation is inexhaustible.
Heaven’s Way benefits without harming.
Heaven’s lack of favor is itself the greatest favor.
The original intent of *The Mysterious Classic on Dao and Virtue* concludes here.
