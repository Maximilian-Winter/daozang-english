**Scroll Four of the *Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue***
*(Original lacks Scrolls One through Three)*

**The Chapter on Supreme Virtue (Chapter One)**

The Dao is the subtle origin of all things—its origin is revered, hence "supreme."
Virtue is the manifestation of compassionate relief—its trace is humble, hence "inferior."

This scroll contains forty-four chapters, divided into three major sections:
The first chapter establishes the foundational principle,
The next forty-two chapters expound its doctrines at length,
And the final chapter concludes by returning to the principle.

Within the first chapter, there are five distinctions:
First, it clarifies that virtue has a crucial essence, thus forming the distinction between supreme and inferior.
Second, it explains the five stages of virtue’s decline and destruction, arising from human nature and temporal conditions.
Third, it reveals how intentions gradually become corrupted, losing the Dao and practicing rituals in vain.
Fourth, it shows how loyalty and sincerity are insufficient, while superficial ornamentation abounds.
Fifth, it demonstrates the existence of the Daoic man, who discards ornamentation and returns to substance.

**Four Sentences (One Section)**

*"The supreme virtue does not act in virtue, yet it has virtue."*
Virtue (*dé*) means "to obtain." Obtaining the Dao, hence it is called virtue.
Virtue has two meanings:
First, the inherent virtue—the wondrous function of the Dao, nurturing all things according to their kind, ensuring universal benefit.
Second, the cultivated attainment—those who align with the Dao first obtain their true nature, ultimately returning to the original Dao. Having attained it themselves, they also enable others to attain it. What is obtained is the Dao, hence it is called *supreme virtue*.

*"Not acting in virtue"* refers to *supreme virtue*.
When virtue harmonizes with the Dao, benefiting all things profoundly and extensively, its deeds are accomplished yet remain hidden. Virtue does not flaunt itself—common people use it daily without knowing, and countless generations rely on it without recognizing it. This is the meaning of *having virtue*—unmatched and exalted, hence called *supreme*.

*"The inferior virtue does not lose virtue, yet it has no virtue."*
When the mind and its objects are both forgotten, and self and other merge seamlessly, harmonizing with the mysterious Dao, this is called virtue.
Yet now, arrogance and attachment persist, and the seals of constraint remain. Though virtue is present, self-perception lingers, and true forgetting has not yet been achieved—hence it is called *inferior*.

**Eleven Sentences (Second Section)**

*"The supreme virtue acts without action, yet nothing is left undone."*
*"Yì"* means "to use." *Without action* refers to the inner mind being empty and tranquil, free from contrived doing.
*"Nothing is left undone"* means external things are pure and unadorned—all conventional affairs are abandoned without interference.
This is the obscurity of supreme virtue.

*"The inferior virtue acts, yet there is much left undone."*
Unable to dispel noble attachments, it engages in contrived deeds and worldly achievements—hence *"acts."*
Seeking honor and profit to enrich one’s family, or fame and posthumous titles to exalt oneself—hence *"much is left undone."*

*"The superior benevolence acts, yet nothing is left undone."*
Benevolence (*rén*) is the advancement of kindness.
Relieving others’ deficiencies by sacrificing oneself, or pardoning others’ faults through private favor—this is *"acting."*
Yet completing what is beneficial without claiming credit, giving aid without expecting repayment—this is *"nothing is left undone."*
Those who receive such benevolence are numerous, and those transformed by it flow like water, swept away by the wind. Benevolence’s path is most excellent, hence it is called *superior*.

*"The superior righteousness acts, yet there is much left undone."*
Righteousness (*yì*) means "what is proper."

When people lack their proper distinctions, and things lose their natural order, yet in times of purity and integrity, there are upright and incorruptible men who tolerate no private deceit. They clearly distinguish right from wrong, carefully judge truth from falsehood, ensuring all receive their due distinctions and nothing loses its proper place—this is the work of the righteous scholar.

To seek near-term honor and profit, or distant fame and posthumous titles—this is *"much is left undone."*

The superior ritual acts, yet none respond to it, so one raises one’s arm and leads by example.

Ritual (*lǐ*) is the proper conduct of one’s bearing.
Bowing and rising, advancing and retreating—when these movements conform to measure, this is ritual.
*"Shoaling"* means to raise one’s arm.
*"Leading"* means to draw others along.
When all proper decorum is complete, this is called *superior*.

Now, ritual is the law governing form. As pure customs degenerate into corruption, human nature grows treacherous and thin, hearts no longer in harmony, and forms become arrogant. Thus, external regulations are established to govern posture and demeanor, so that the heart may gradually soften in step with the body, and the inner self align with the outer.

Yet there are those whose inner and outer selves contradict—where the form complies but the heart rebels, where deceit lurks within while the exterior conforms to ritual. Hence, anger arises, arms are raised, and contention ensues—this is the beginning of ritual’s failure, the origin of disorder.

Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows; when virtue is lost, benevolence follows; when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows; when righteousness is lost, ritual follows.
The Dao is the highest virtue.
*"Later virtue"* refers to lower virtue.
The highest virtue aligns with the Dao, hence it is called *Dao*.
Initially, it was paired with the Dao, hence called *virtue*.
Now, paired with later virtue, it is again called *Dao*.

Since people cannot practice the Dao of supreme, effortless virtue—where all is forgotten—yet cling to the lower virtue of deliberate action.
The lower virtue is when all actions are complete, yet nothing is forgotten.
Benevolence is but one aspect of virtue—kindness and forgiveness.
Since people cannot embody all virtues, this one alone is emphasized.
Within benevolence, the highest is called *superior*.
Benevolence wins through kindness, while righteousness prevails through severity.
Righteousness subdues through punishment, benevolence through grace.
Thus, benevolence surpasses righteousness.

Righteousness is like wielding punishment to suppress the heart, while ritual merely regulates form to conform to propriety. Hence, though the exterior may appear refined, the interior remains rigid and unyielding—this is the outward gentleman and inward petty man, hence the raising of arms and contention.

Ritual is but the thinnest veneer of loyalty and trust, yet it is the first seed of disorder.
Loyalty means a single, sincere heart; trust means unhesitating obedience.
From purity to corruption, ritual becomes the lowest extreme. As loyalty and trust fade, empty formalities remain, and the body betrays the heart—thus, it becomes the origin of chaos.

Moreover, the Dao is boundless, valuing only sincerity and unity. Thus, it embraces the clumsy and the refined alike, yet rejects the artificial and constrained.
Ritual, though structured by rules, emphasizes propriety in every movement—advancing, retreating, bowing, rising—thus attaining its highest form.
Here, the Dao values the heart, while ritual governs the form. To regulate the heart is to enter the Dao; to regulate the form is to conform to convention. If the heart lacks the Dao yet follows convention, how could disorder not arise?

*"Preconception"* is the flower of the Dao, yet the beginning of folly.
Preconception has two forms:
One, where the heart truly does not know, yet the mouth speaks as if it does—where recognition precedes knowledge, hence *"preconception."*
Two, where the mind is enslaved to premature judgments, competing to recognize first. The wise first know with the heart, then speak with the mouth; yet here, the mouth speaks before the heart knows. Thus, recognition precedes knowledge—this is the superficial bloom of the Dao.

When pure customs decay and competitive greed takes root, this becomes the initial loss of the Dao, the start of vulgar folly.

Thus, the true man abides in substance, not in superficiality.
*"Zhang"* means long; *"fu"* means to uphold.
He who possesses great virtue and nurtures all beings, sustaining the people—this is the true man.
In his conduct, he dwells in substance, not in corruption.
He is devoted solely to the Dao, knowing nothing of ritual’s artifices.
Substance and superficiality are one in origin, yet differ in preference—whether valued for their genuine or false qualities.
Thus, the false and superficial pale beside the true and substantial.
To reside in truth, not in illusion.
The true man is one who follows the Dao.
Guarding the heart in sincerity, rejecting deceit, he inspires others to do the same.
Thus, he discards the false and embraces the true.
To establish oneself in action, discarding the superficial and embracing the substantial.
For the substantial is near the Dao, while the superficial is distant.

**Former Chapter Two**
At the beginning of this great section, forty-two chapters expound on various principles. The previous chapter clarified how the five virtues decline—from Dao to ritual as the source of disorder. This chapter demonstrates how all people return to their roots, align with the Dao, and restore harmony. It follows the natural inclinations of each to guide them back, hence its placement.

Within this chapter, four distinctions are made:
First, it clarifies that all colored and formed things share the same fundamental *qi*.
Second, it shows that though disciples may be many, all are encouraged toward non-action.
Third, it demonstrates that lowering the high and elevating the low is the enduring way.
Fourth, it states that abandoning the noble for the humble is the path to returning to true nature.

**Those who attained Oneness in the past,**

Those who attained Oneness in the past,
**were the origin of the Dao/Way’s vital *qi*—the first to emerge and give birth.**

In ancient times, Heaven, Earth, and all ten thousand things
**received the same fundamental *qi* of Oneness, and thus came to life and form.**
This sentence summarizes how birth arises from the lower distinctions of obtaining Oneness.

Heaven receives Oneness and becomes **clear and serene**,
Earth receives Oneness and becomes **settled and tranquil**.
The *qi* of Oneness divides into yin and yang:
**Yang *qi* ascends, clear and pure, becoming Heaven.**
When Heaven receives the **clear *qi* within Oneness**, it is Heaven—thus **serene and luminous**.
**Yin *qi* descends, turbid and dense, becoming Earth.**
When Earth receives the **turbid *qi* within Oneness**, it is Earth—thus **stable and at peace**.

The **spirit** receives Oneness and becomes **responsive and alive**,
The **valleys** receive Oneness and become **filled and abundant**.
Within the *qi* of Oneness, there exists that which is **neither yin nor yang**—this is called **harmony**.
Once yin and yang are distinguished,
**the yin-dominant aspect of harmony becomes ghosts and spirits,**
as well as the **essences of mountains and rivers**.
Ghosts and spirits alike **obtain Oneness**—
their **mystical responsiveness** is inexhaustible,
their **flowing abundance** is unending.
The essences of rivers and valleys are also like **humans in possessing spirit**.

All **ten thousand things** receive Oneness and thus **come to life**,
**Nobles and kings** receive Oneness and become **the rectifiers of the world**.
Ten thousand things—**the collective name for all that bears life**.
Humans are **most responsive**, thus standing **at the head of all things**.
Nobles and kings **partially receive the refined harmony of Oneness**,
and become **leaders of the people, the sovereigns of governance and teaching**.

**This is how they achieve their station.**
*Station*—**this is attainment**.

**The six matters above**—
Heaven, Earth, spirit, and valleys—
**all share the same fundamental *qi* of Oneness**, and thus **come to life and form**.
**Six sentences follow.**

If Heaven lacks **clarity**, it **risks fragmentation**;
If Earth lacks **tranquility**, it **risks upheaval**.
Oneness—**the origin of *qi***—
**is the ultimate void, without form or trace**.
Heaven and Earth **retain Oneness** to preserve their **clarity and peace**,
but they must also **guard it** to endure.
If they indulge in **action or desire**,
they **will inevitably lose Oneness**—
then Heaven **lacks Oneness to sustain its clarity**, and **darkness, confusion, and rupture** will ensue.
Earth **lacks Oneness to uphold its peace**, and **tremors, convulsions, and overflow** will follow.
**Oneness is that which can be attained from beginning to end**—
it cannot be **obtained at the start and lost at the close**.
This is **the inevitability of initial attainment**,
but **the certainty of later loss through human interference**.
Thus, **fragmentation and upheaval** are warned against.

If the **spirit lacks responsiveness**, it **risks exhaustion**;
If the **valleys lack abundance**, they **risk depletion**.
If the spirit **employs Oneness**,
it **rises in emptiness and attains its own clarity**—
**mysterious and boundless, yet if it becomes arrogant and proud**,
its **functions and powers will surely cease**.
The **essences of rivers and lakes**,
**proud and self-satisfied**, clash with Oneness—
then **rivers and lakes dry up**, their **sources scorch**.
All **ten thousand things** lack **life**, and **decay will follow**;
Nobles and kings lack **Oneness**, and **downfall will surely come**.
Oneness—**the marvelous *qi* of the Dao/Way**—
**is the root of all formed things**.
If humans **can return to their origin and uphold Oneness**,
then **life is preserved**.
If they **chase the superficial and lose Oneness**,
then **true nature is extinguished**.
Nobles and kings **lack Oneness to govern their station**,
and **rapid ruin** will follow—**speaking of collapse**.
These **six matters all warn against arrogance and excess**,
and though **Heaven, Earth, spirits, and valleys** are mentioned,
it is because **all possess responsive essences**,
and through human warnings, they are **included universally**.
Thus the preface to the *jue* states:
**Heaven, Earth, ghosts, and spirits all revere the same principle—**
**their forms differ, yet their essence is identical.**

Therefore,
**the noble finds its foundation in the humble,**
**the high finds its base in the low**.
Those who **guard the Dao of Oneness**,
**must only rise in emptiness**—
**regardless of noble or humble status,**
**to be modest and self-effacing is to align with the Dao and ensure safety,**
**while pride and self-aggrandizement are to defy the Dao and court destruction**.

Thus, nobles and kings **call themselves "lonely," "widowed," and "without grain"**—
**is this not their claim of humility as foundation?**
No?
**"Lonely," "solitary," "widowed," "without grain"**—
these are **humans’ vilest names**.
**"Without grain"**—**also not virtuous**.
Grain—**this is stipend**.
To **humble oneself without virtue**,
to **be unworthy of receiving stipends**,
if one’s **actions and intentions are thus**—
how **could this not be a claim of humility**,
while **still employing Oneness to govern nobility?**
No—**this is a question to the saying above**.

Thus,
**to earn many praises is to have no praises at all**.
*Praise*—**this is commendation**.
To **seek praise and multiply commendations**,
**is to have none truly earned**—
the **king is named by the people’s collective acclaim**.
To **examine the king’s true substance**,
**there is no fixed form of kingship**.
Why?
The **four limbs and hundred bodies** each have their **own names**.
If there is **no named king**,
and the **title is only collective acclaim**,
then **it is a false union, not reality**.
To **trace the origin of the name**,
it **comes from the common folk**—
by **the common folk’s own accord**, it is **empty and false**.
If the **name of king** lacks **true substance**,
then **internally, there is no fixed kingly essence**,
and **externally, there is no true kingly name**.
If **both inner and outer lack substance**,
then **neither inner nor outer exists**—
who **then can claim the name?**
Through this **multiplication of praises**, **no true praise is earned**.
All **dharma/laws** follow this example—
**false claims of origin**.
**Carriages and vehicles**—
**also explained thus**.
This **scripture is concise in principle yet broad in meaning**,
its **body rich with implied refutations**.
It **discards all external causes**, and **forgets the heart’s attachments**,
**while aligning with the Dao of Laozi and Zhuangzi’s teachings**—
**both have established their doctrines**.
Thus **Zhuangzi says**:
*"Lending oneself to foreign things,
entrusting oneself to shared bodies—
if foreign things are borrowed,
shared bodies are not truly one’s own."*

Again he says:
*"Now, if one points to a horse’s hundred bodies
and cannot find the horse itself,
yet the horse is tied before you,
how can it be called a horse?"*

And in the *Sutra of the Western Ascension* it states:
*"The four great elements—Earth, Water, Fire, and Wind—
**are combined and dispersed according to the seasons’ *qi*.***
Earth and Water—**these are the four great**;
Fire and Wind—**these are the four seasonal *qi*.***
The **four great are falsely combined**,
**due to the ebb and flow of time**—
**temporarily forming a body**,
yet the **four great cannot each generate life independently**;
they **must rely on all causes converging** to **complete the form**.
If the **human body’s four great disperse**—
where **does the body go?**
Following the **text’s meaning**, I do not explain thus.
**One must instead rely on the interpretations of ancient scholars**—
how **does this differ from the Daoist and secular traditions?**

**To instruct the disciples of Fu Yi**—
though his **doctrine is established**, its **substance is not**—
it **declares that common Daoists**,
**tainted by foreign customs**,
if **Daoists can be slandered**,
then **it says "tainted"**—
**where does the scripture intend to place its teachings?**
It **does not wish to be smooth as jade,**
**nor rough as stone**.
**Ancient texts described smoothness like jade’s luster,**
**roughness like stone’s hardness, inferior to jade**.
Now **following the Master’s original terms**—*"luoluo ququ"*—
**jade is what humans hold most noble**.

The name **"falling and abandoned"**—
**stone is the most despised among things**.
**Those who follow the Dao do not wish to be as noble as jade,**
**chasing and striving without rest,**
**nor do they wish to be as despised as stone,**
**settling into stillness and returning to the Dao**.

Now **not speaking of being between jade and stone**,
**for this chapter follows only from the low and base,**
**with no intention of moderation**.

**The chapter on "Return"**—the third—
**previously clarified that all things, born of shared qi, are made,**
**now clarifies that all people, in their natural state, are without affairs.**
**Life follows the superficial while returning to the root—**
**contrasting the two to show gain and loss differ.**

**Previously, it was said to abandon traces and return to the root, without affairs;**
**now it points out the origin of life, ordering things to follow accordingly.**

**Two sentences before.**
**"Return" is the Dao’s movement,**
**"weakness" is the Dao’s application.**
**Return is returning to the root.**
**Movement refers to affairs.**
**Common people take change as movement—**
**seeking the new while abandoning the old.**
**Those who follow the Dao abandon the superficial and return to the root,**
**which is the affair of the enlightened—**
**thus it is called the Dao’s movement.**
**The body at ease, the heart tranquil—this is stillness.**
**Abandoning what is to return to what is not—this is movement.**
**Just as "far" is called returning first,**
**though not physically distant,**
**it is named "far" because the Dao has no form.**
**Now also not coming is not near,**
**for though the body possesses it, it is called "return."**
**The Dao has no coming or going, yet bears the names "far" and "return,"**
**and the tranquil heart also holds the meaning of return-movement.**

**When the inner heart is empty and still,**
**and outward conduct is gentle and yielding—**
**this is the practice of returning to the root.**
**Thus it is said: "Weakness is the Dao’s application."**

**Three sentences after.**
**All things under heaven are born from existence.**
**Existence is qi.**
**Though not yet formed, it already possesses qi.**
**Thus it is said that heaven, earth, and all dharmas**
**arise from one qi—**
**hence, "born from existence."**
**Existence is born from non-existence.**
**Non-existence is the Dao.**
**Qi arises from the Dao, hence "born from non-existence."**
**Pushing to the extreme the source of generation, pointing to the Dao,**
**to make all beings turn their hearts toward something before them—**
**for "return" is to return to this non-existence.**

**The chapter on the "Superior Person"**—the fourth—
**previously demonstrated the Dao’s root, ordering all things to return in unity,**
**now clarifies that the superior person, without doubt, diligently practices with faith.**
**First, diligence; then, habituation—**
**thus the three distinctions in rank.**

**Initially, it clarifies that the three kinds of people—**
**hearing the Dao and believing or slandering—differ:**
**Next, it cites ancient methods where blind teachers hid their virtue,**
**and finally, it states that only the Dao lends itself equally to all beings.**

**Seven sentences—first section.**
**The superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it.**
**The Dao is what was previously spoken of—**
**that which, born of non-existence, returns to the root.**
**The superior person, hearing of this Dao, believes and practices it with diligence,**
**the heart without doubt—**
**thus the superior person.**

**The middle person hears the Dao, as if it exists, as if it does not.**
**Existence is "having"; non-existence is "not."**
**Though hearing of the Dao, the heart does not fully believe,**
**sometimes desiring to return, yet doubting its truth—**
**thus the middle person.**

**The inferior person hears the Dao and laughs at it.**
**Hearing of the Dao’s emptiness, stillness, and formlessness,**
**not believing in its marvel, clapping and laughing—**
**thus the inferior person.**

**By this, the faith and slander of scholars are distinguished—**
**superior, middle, and inferior.**
**Not to laugh is insufficient to be the Dao.**
**Insufficient is as much as "not obtaining."**
**The inferior person takes gentleness for cowardice,**
**not competing for foolishness,**
**and thus laughs at it.**
**The inferior person does not laugh because they take**
**much knowledge as strength,**
**debate as virtue, deceit as wisdom,**
**and whatever is obtained as ability—**
**these are not the Dao, yet the inferior person holds them in esteem,**
**thus deeming them virtue and not laughing.**
**How can this be the Dao?**
**Thus it is insufficient to be the Dao.**

**Thirteen sentences—second section.**

**Thus it is said:**

*"To abandon the void and forget gentleness is what the inferior person laughs at.
Therefore, I cite ancient methods to prove the law of what is laughed at—
this is the superior sage’s teaching.
The Dao is bright yet seems obscured,
advancing yet seems retreating—
this is the ancient sage’s law, which the superior person believes and diligently practices.
Within, the heart is clear and advancing;
without, the appearance is dark and retreating.

The Dao is plain yet seems ordinary.
Within, the heart is level as the Dao,
while outward, the form does not differ from the common crowd.
*[Note: Some texts read *颣 (jié) as "restrained," meaning self-restraint.]*
The heart is level, the form restrained—
not differing from restraint.

The highest virtue is like a valley,
great brightness like humiliation,
vast virtue like insufficiency.
The valley—empty and receptive—
is the likeness of the highest virtue.
Within, the heart is pure and unadorned,
while outwardly, it appears as if stained with shame.
Virtue and deeds are fully present,
yet the form seems common and foolish—
thus, it appears insufficient.

Establishing virtue is like theft,
authentic simplicity like deceit.
*Theft—stealing. Deceit—change.*
To establish virtue as if secretly stealing,
fearing others’ awareness,
hiding one’s name while rejecting boastfulness.
*[Some ancient texts read *输 (shū) as "surrender," or *揄 (yú) as "to draw out." But the Sage’s teaching, for the sake of practical guidance, takes "theft" as the primary meaning.]*
Deceit—also meaning shallow color.
Within, the heart is pure and unchanging in the Dao,
while outwardly, it follows the times,
adapting to things and changing.
Speaking of shallowness—
its form is neither impure nor pure,
like the indistinct green and white of an ambiguous symbol.

The great square has no corners,
the great vessel is late in forming.
*[The next four lines elucidate the completion of Dao and virtue.]*
He who walks the straight Dao
has no small angles—
no minor practices to obstruct the Dao,
no petty corners to harm the upright.
The great vessel is the Dao-heart.
All things, though great, form early,
but the Dao-vessel, without doing,
cannot be completed in haste—
thus, it is late in forming.
*[This is for those who seek the Dao in the morning but gaze toward evening.]*

Great sound is rare in voice,
great form has no shape.
Great sound—speech that elucidates the Dao.
Those who harbor the Dao scarcely sense its response,
asking nothing, speaking little—
few question the Dao, so great sound is rare.
Thus, it warns against excessive speech.
Those who harbor the Dao and virtue
hold themselves in humble simplicity,
not adorned with artificial restraints—
hence, it is said to have no shape.
*[This warns against embellishing appearance.]*
*[End of the next three sentences.]*

The Dao is hidden and nameless.
*[This clarifies the Dao’s essence—
the ultimate Dao is formless,
shared yet unseen by all,
so it is hidden;
without substance to name,
so it is nameless.]*
Clothing covers all life—
a forced name for the great Dao.
The first eight lines and the four great principles are all methods;
this section reveals the Dao’s hidden exterior and illuminated interior,
establishing it as the core principle.

Only the Dao
is good at lending and completing.
*[A sigh of praise—
among all things, only the Dao
can lend qi and complete all things.]*
Speaking of lending—
it is temporary borrowing, not permanent giving,
"and" implies provisional completion, not lasting permanence.
It desires that those who borrow do not linger long,
that those who are completed do not remain forever—
that gratitude for borrowing and completion comes swiftly.

Those who are completed and return
owe it to the lending;
the profound meaning of "and" is deep.

**Chapter Five: The Dao Gives Birth**

Previously, it was said that the Dao alone
is good at lending and completing virtue and deeds.
Now, it is said that the Dao has divine mystery
as the source of birth and the origin of virtue and form—
thus, there are four distinctions:
First, it clarifies the origin of birth
to recognize the root.
Second, it reveals the delusions of the vulgar and foolish
in their inclinations toward or against the Dao.
Third, it warns of the consequences
to demonstrate gain and loss.
Fourth, it emphasizes the arrogance of the strong
as the heaviest delusion.

The Dao gives birth to One,
One gives birth to Two,
Two gives birth to Three,
Three gives birth to all things.
The Dao is ultimate emptiness,
One is subtle existence.
Ultimate emptiness is not nothing—
it can give birth from One.
The Dao is one body,
One is the Dao’s qi.
Qi arises from the body,
hence, the Dao gives birth to One.
Though the Dao gives birth to One,
it remains within One,
its divine functions flowing freely—
only coarse and subtle differ.

One originates from the Dao,
its essence never diminished.
One—this is the Original Qi, also called *Taihe* [Great Harmony].
Speaking numerically, it is called One;
speaking of virtue, it is called Harmony.
It is the beginning of qi, hence also called Original.
Qi is subtle existence, yet not existence—
without color, without sound,
not existing yet existing,
able to give birth to Two.
Two refers to the coarse qi of yin and yang.
Now, One as a thing—
from nothingness to existence,
most subtle and mysterious,
its nature distinct from emptiness,
not to be called nothing,
its form not yet shaped,
not to be called existence—
it contains all things,
mixed within.
It has divine function,
able to be clear or turbid.
Clear qi is yang,
turbid qi is yin.
Yin and yang emerge together,
hence, it gives birth to Two.
Yin and yang separate,
One spreads into Two affairs,
Two originates from One,
remaining whole as before.

Two then gives birth to Three—
Three refers to form and substance already complete:
heaven, earth, and humanity.
Pure yang is clear—heaven;
pure yin is turbid—earth;
harmonious qi is humanity.
Harmony—One qi containing the mysteries of yin and yang.
The three combine as harmony.
If harmony is taken as the blending of clear and turbid
to form heaven, earth, and humanity,
then this would be Three giving birth to Three.
But here it says Two gives birth to Three,
meaning One qi is spread within Two,
so only Two is spoken of.
It is like the Dao permeating the Three Realms—
directly taking heaven, earth, and humanity as Three,
not counting the Dao as a fourth.
Though heaven, earth, and humanity each contain
the three qi of yin, yang, and harmony in full,
outside of heaven, earth, and humanity,
the original yin, yang, and harmony qi are undiminished.
If heaven, earth, yin, and yang, and all things
lack harmonious qi, how could they stand?
How much more could they give birth to things?

*[Above, from nothingness to existence,
from subtlety to coarseness—
this is called "giving birth,"
not like today’s generation from form.]*

「Thus, when humanity first comes into being, it receives the harmonious and the two qi of purity and turbidity. The subtle and the refined coalesce and solidify, transforming and giving rise to form. The spirit and consciousness are the refined essence of the harmonious Dao, sharing with heaven and earth the same received qi to bring forth life. Therefore, the *Western Ascension Scripture* says: *"I divide One qi with heaven and earth to govern them, maintaining the original root as my principle."*

The Three giving birth to myriad things are as follows: heaven and earth give birth to myriad things, and humanity gives birth to humanity, nurturing and lengthening them, so that all things fulfill their nature and flourish. From this point onward, all is the interplay of yin and yang, generating life through form and appearance—thus it is called the Three giving birth to myriad things.

**The next five sentences speak of Two.**

All things bear yin on their backs and embrace yang in front, with the harmonious qi as their core. *Bear* means to lean against; *embrace* means to turn toward; *core* means the central space. For humanity, the back is yin, hence the word *bear*. The heart and front are yang, hence the word *embrace*. The harmonious qi resides within, permeating and regulating yin and yang, harmonizing the viscera and bowels, so that form and spirit are fully complete—thus it is said, *"the harmonious qi as their core."*

Grasses and trees grow from the earth and stretch toward the sky, similarly bearing yin and embracing yang, all possessing harmonious qi—only differing in lacking consciousness.

What humanity detests are the states of *孤* (lonely), *寡* (few), and *不谷* (unfulfilled), yet kings and nobles take these as titles. This reveals the emergence of emotional desires, where love and aversion first arise—this is the beginning of all beings creating karma.

*孤* (lonely), *寡* (few), and *不谷* (unfulfilled) are universally despised, yet all seek wealth and honor for their own gain. Others harm them instead of helping. Kings and nobles adopt these titles for themselves, and the people love them.

**The next two sentences speak of Three.**

Thus, things either suffer loss to bring benefit or benefit to bring loss. *Things* here refers to all humanity. Kings and nobles adopt titles of *孤* and *寡* for themselves—this is self-loss. Yet they ultimately reside in wealth and honor—this is the people’s loss to benefit themselves. Self-benefit invites harm from others.

This passage ties together the preceding and following sections. **The next five sentences speak of Four.**

What humanity is taught is also what I teach—easily understood. Common teachings all deviate from my Dao of *wuwei* (non-action), instead practicing the Way of *youwei* (action). Thus, the heart lacks humility and moderation, and life is cut short by untimely death. The strong and ruthless do not attain a natural death.

The bold and decisive, who harm others to benefit themselves, are like the strong and unyielding. All things suppress and crush them, causing them to perish midway—dying unnaturally, not in accordance with the Dao. They do not attain a good end, nor do they die in accord with principle.

I shall take them as my teaching example. *I* refers to Laozi. *Example* means root. For the bold and ruthless, death cannot be avoided, so I speak of self-loss to restrain them. Teaching serves as the foundation for those who study; by weighing loss and benefit, I clearly demonstrate what is to come.

This chapter first explains the origin of life to inspire reverence, then enumerates calamities to instill fear and abandonment. It is a combination of admonition and encouragement, urging one to discard superficiality and return to the root.

**The next four sentences speak of the sixth chapter on the world:**

Before, it was explained that the bold and ruthless do not attain a natural death; now, it is made clear that the gentle and weak align with the true and authentic.

Gentle opposes firm—this is the second distinction of the subsequent teachings. First, it is shown that refined intent and gentle weakness can break through rigidity and strength; then, it is lamented that the common people rarely understand the benefits of *wuwei* (non-action).

**The first four sentences:**

The world’s utmost gentleness overcomes the world’s utmost firmness. *Utmost gentleness* and *utmost firmness* each have two meanings: one external, one internal. The external meaning is that within all phenomena, the gentlest is the Dao, and the firmest is metal and stone. *Overcomes* is like the swiftness of a galloping horse—though metal and stone are firm, the Dao penetrates and courses through them, coming and going like a galloping horse.

Thus, the *Western Ascension Scripture* says: *"The Dao’s gentleness and weakness envelop heaven and earth, penetrating all things."*

The internal meaning is that *utmost gentleness* refers to the Dao-heart, and *utmost firmness* refers to afflictions. Afflictions, though countless, are as firm as metal and stone—only the gentle and weak Dao-heart can effectively assail them, causing all to dissolve. Without afflictions, one enters the realm of *wujian* (no separation).

Therefore, I know the benefits of *wuwei* (non-action). *Without afflictions* refers to the heart, and *no separation* refers to the Dao. The heart, free from sensory attachments, exhausts all worldly desires—thus it is called *without afflictions*. The supreme Dao is subtle and boundless, without flaws or gaps—thus it is called *no separation*. *Enter* means to unite harmoniously. Though the Dao is subtle and profound, the heart is the gap, and one who possesses nothing—uniting with the Dao’s inner emptiness—finds the heart ever more spacious. By this measure, it is known that the virtue of a vacant heart and the practice of *wuwei* greatly benefit humanity.

**The next three sentences speak of the seventh chapter:**

The teaching of *wuwei* (non-action), though unspoken, brings benefit—yet few in the world attain it. Those who know the Dao lead by example, not speaking aloud. Those who learn the Dao observe with their eyes and act with their hearts, laboring not with their bodies. The body does nothing, the heart desires nothing—first breaking afflictions, then entering *wujian*, attaining the benefits of *wuwei*.

He who does not speak is heard by none, and he who acts without doing is seen by none. Beyond hearing and seeing, this is not the knowledge of ordinary people. Thus, few in the world can truly grasp it—only those who can discern traces and know the heart may receive the unspoken teaching.

**The next three sentences speak of the eighth chapter:**

Before, it was shown that the virtue of *wuwei* benefits one without words; now, it is revealed that the common worldly Way is filled with greed, harming oneself. The first distinction was between gain and loss in relation to the body—what is closer, the body or reputation? Next, it is made clear that deep attachment brings danger, and heavy loss follows. Finally, it is shown that cutting off greed and knowing contentment brings self-fulfillment and eternal life.

**The first three sentences:**

Reputation and the body—what is closer? Reputation is the empty praise of external things, while the body is the true essence of life and death. Without the body, life is severed; without reputation, life endures long. Thus, the wise conceal their reputation to avoid calamity and preserve their body, while the foolish covet reputation and lose their spirit, harming their life.

This is why the question is posed: between reputation and the body, which is closer? It prompts self-examination and understanding. In Laozi’s time, there were those who killed their bodies to gain reputation—he lamented their delusion, hence setting this question to warn the virtuous.»

Between the body and wealth, which is more abundant?
Wealth is the general term for all possessions.
Those who seek wealth intend to nourish their bodies, yet now there are those who, in their greed for riches, lose their lives—it seems wealth is plentiful while the body is scarce, the height of folly.

If one arm is worth more than all under heaven, how much greater the benefit of preserving one’s whole body?
This is a warning to the petty.

Between gain and loss, which is the greater affliction?
This is a paired question.
To lose reputation and wealth is an affliction, while gain is not.
From the perspective of the Dao, gain is dishonor and injury to virtue, inviting calamity and misfortune—this is the affliction.
Loss, however, brings bodily peace, flourishing virtue, and blessings—full life is without affliction.

Reputation and wealth are what people commonly rely upon.
When appropriate, they bring fortune; when excessive, they bring disaster.
The distinction between appropriateness and excess is clear—this is the mirror.

Thus, the more one loves, the greater the expenditure;
the more one hoards, the greater the loss.
This explains the answer to the question of reputation.
To love dangerous tools excessively harms the spirit and shortens life, undermines merit, and depletes qi—this is great expenditure.
Greed without restraint, unable to disperse what is gained, hoarding deeply and hiding away—this invites robbery and plunder.
All who die unnaturally or suffer harm for the sake of reputation and wealth are victims of great loss.

Therefore, contentment brings no shame,
and knowing when to stop brings no peril—
thus one may endure long.
The contented know their proper measure, which has two aspects:
one is the measure of nature,
the other is the measure of things.
The measure of nature is like hunger requiring food, cold requiring clothing—
when the belly is full and the body warm, nature is already satisfied.
Excessive furs not worn, leftover food not tasted—
these are beyond natural measure.
Contentment is the ability to stop, called wisdom.
If one eats when already full, it breeds abdominal illness.
If one clothes oneself when already warm, it invites fever.
Within, there is the ugliness of self-harm;
without, there is the reputation of gluttony—
thus it is shameful.

The measure of things refers to what one ought to possess—
this is one’s proper share.
Not taking beyond one’s share is knowing when to stop,
and thus there is no danger or peril.
The unrestrained take beyond their share by force,
and thus invite ruin and death.
Even if one eats beyond fullness, unaware that food is one’s proper share and not another’s,
it is a failure of self-restraint—
thus one earns a shameful reputation.
Though shame is an ugly deed, it does not lead to ruin and death.
This shows that contentment’s virtue is profound while its deficiency is shallow,
and knowing when to stop is weak while its excess is deep.
Since one’s conduct already has contentment and restraint,
shame and peril cannot touch them—
thus they preserve their natural lifespan without early death,
securing enduring life—who can shorten it?

**Chapter Eight of *Daode Jing* Commentary:**
Previously, it was shown that greed for reputation and competition for wealth lead to the loss of both.
Now it is shown that abandoning wealth and forgetting reputation bring fulfillment of virtue and merit,
holding up blessings and warning against calamity—
thus the two distinctions follow in order.
Previously, it was shown that having virtue could diminish and thus achieve fulfillment;
now it is shown that agitation leads to deficiency while tranquility aligns with the Dao.

If Great Completion is deficient,
its use will not be exhausted.
"Exhausted" means impoverished.
Those whose deeds are perfectly accomplished
remain humble all day, as if deficient,
yet their virtue fills within and benefits others without—
like a wellspring, its use never ends,
and thus there is no exhaustion.

Previously, it was those who sought reputation and lost their lives,
for they did not forget.
Now, those who forget reputation and obscure their traces
preserve their virtue and longevity.

If Great Fullness is empty,
its use will not be spent.
Those whose virtue and Dao are perfectly full
appear externally empty, as if lacking,
yet they respond to circumstances without end—
already complete and full, their virtue is comprehensive.

If Great Straightness is bent,
the heart conforms to the Dao,
cutting off private and evil desires—
this is Great Straightness.
To follow the ways of the world, yielding without resistance—
this is bending.

If Great Skill is clumsy,
to act with clever expedience, perfectly suited—
this is Great Skill.
To follow conventions without innovation—
this is clumsiness.

If Great Eloquence is inarticulate,
to discern truth from falsehood, analyze doubts—
this is Great Eloquence.
To speak without flattery, expressing meaning without words—
this is inarticulateness.

**Chapter Sixteen: *Making Me***

Before, it was declared that reckless action brings ruin—
once lost, salvation is dire.
Now, with knowledge and action along the Dao,
fear is profound, warnings earnest.
Thus, three distinctions are made:
First, the expedient speech of the Sage
so things may follow in trust.
Second, how humans, loving false paths,
suffer loss in virtue and wealth.
Last, how thieves, boasting of their gains,
prove the Dao’s falsity.

**First Three Lines:**
*"Make me aware, that I may walk the Great Dao,*
*yet act with utmost reverence."*

*"Make me"*—expedient words.
*"Aware"*—vast.
Zang Xiú both deemed it small.
Now, with the Two Virtues,
those who know plot schemes—
small wisdom, yet hearts walk the Great Dao,
teaching with laborious intent.
Even killing a father or elder brother
demands restraint—
how much more so for those who know
and teach with purpose?

They blaspheme the brilliance of sun and moon,
erode the essence of mountains and rivers,
disrupt the harmony of the four seasons,
so that crawling worms feast upon them,
seated in their ruin.
The pure customs of antiquity
are thus defiled,
the Three Powers unbalanced,
the Five Phases disordered—
what greater terror than this?
Thus, with no trifling intent,
one who knows must not act in transformation.

**Next Nine Lines:**
The Great Dao is effortless,
yet people love shortcuts.
*"Shortcuts"*—false paths.
Ren and righteousness are minor deeds,
artificial actions bring scant fortune—
all are not the True Way,
yet crowds pursue them,
fearing they may not keep up,
their hearts lost to the vast,
unaware of what is not true.

The Great Dao is smooth and level,
without desire, without striving.
Within, the mind is not weary with thought,
without, no wealth is wasted.
Sitting in ease, doing nothing,
the world follows in transformation—
this is the Great Dao’s way.
Yet none can truly know it.

Morning, the halls are cleared,
fields lie fallow,
granaries stand empty.

「The morning court—
a hall of the Great Dao.
When the Five Ranks gather in unity,
and the Four Quarters bow in allegiance,
one must demonstrate **humility and gentleness** (谦柔),
and adorn with **frugality and plainness** (俭素).

*"Cleared"* (除)—the steps of the palace,
or the removal of old adornment for new.
Destroying thatched roofs and earthen steps,
erecting lofty halls and ornate pavements,
exaggerating craftsmanship to dazzle others,
indulging in extravagance to exalt oneself—
this is what *"cleared"* means.

Seizing the farmer’s labor,
conscripting the strong,
leaving eastern slopes unplowed,
abandoning southern fields to ruin—
this is *"fallow"* (芜).

Grain fails to ripen,
walls crumble, roofs leak,
the people lack sustenance,
households and states hold no reserve—
this is *"empty"* (虚).

**Morning** (朝) refers to the mind within the body—
the mind, where the Five Spirits and myriad talents converge,
where gain and loss of fame and profit intersect,
where right and wrong, deliberation and calculation gather.
Thus, it is called **morning**.

Yet, when one further diminishes the already diminished,
until reaching **non-action** (无为),
and instead scorns plainness and simplicity,
despises sincerity and authenticity,
speaks without truthfulness,
and favors empty flourishes—
this is *"cleared"* (除).

Cravings fill the heart,
right and wrong clutter the mind,
the **spiritual chamber** (灵府) grows dim and filthy,
wisdom and discernment wither—
this is *"fallow"* (芜) of the mind.

**Dao-practice** (道业) neglected,
virtuous deeds left incomplete,
straining necks to flaunt hollow boasts—
this is *"empty"* (虚).

Wearing garments of fine colors,
bearing sharp blades for gain,
sated by every delicacy,
while treasures overflow the storehouses—
this is called **robbery and boasting** (盗夸).
**Robbery and boasting** is not the Dao.
All these riches were never truly yours—
stripped from the people,
yet paraded as your own possessions.
The calamity and blame are profound—
how can this be the Dao?
All that was previously condemned
fails to embody the Great Dao.

Those who practice **Ren and righteousness** (仁义) have already been shown to abandon the Dao—
how much more so when they stray beyond Ren and righteousness into false paths?

**Chapter Seventeen: On the Goodness of Establishing Virtue**
The **illuminated** (明) love shortcuts without restraint,
benefiting themselves at others’ expense—
this is the **illuminated** (明) who value **true virtue** (真守分),
cultivate the self for others’ benefit (修身利物).
*"Remedy follows ailment"* (前病后药)—
thus it comes next.

There are three distinctions:
First, the **illuminated** (明) who steadfastly establish virtue and uphold the Dao without wavering.
Second, those who cultivate the self and their household, gradually broadening their benefit to others.
Third, those who, through this, perceive others and know what constitutes **true kinship** (至亲).

**Establishing virtue does not waver** (善建不拔),
**Embracing virtue does not falter** (善抱不脱).

*"Establishing"* (建)—the beginning of a matter.
*"Wavering"* (拔)—its ruin afterward.
To establish virtue in the Dao,
to correct its onset and solidify its foundation,
without being toppled by changing times—
this is to establish virtue well.

*"Embracing"* (抱)—to uphold and guard.
*"Faltering"* (脱)—to lose and abandon.
If one steadfastly upholds the Dao,
never losing it—
this is embracing virtue well.

Descendants continue sacrifices without ceasing.
To *"cease"* (辍)—to stop.
Sacrifices by descendants—
those with ancestral halls,
when descendants flourish, sacrifices endure.
When descendants decline, sacrifices vanish.
If virtue is established and the Dao unbroken,
a household of goodness accumulates vast blessings—
ancestors honored above,
descendants enlightened below,
each generation producing the worthy and wise,
their succession unbroken.
Though some may dismiss descendants as shallow,
this *Scripture* does not limit its teaching by such distinctions—
for even those with descendants
need not be excluded from embracing the Dao.

The following text speaks of
cultivating the self, the household,
and extending this to all under heaven—
thus it is known that the *Scripture*’s intent
permeates universally,
benefiting both **Daoists** (道士) and the **common folk** (俗).

When virtue is cultivated **in the self** (修之身),
its **power** (德) becomes **true** (真).
To cultivate the self with the Dao—
to abandon cravings,
to discard falsehood and deceit,
to focus and guard in unity—
its **power** (德) is **true**.

When virtue is cultivated **in the household** (修之家),
its **power** (德) has **surplus** (有余).
Like birds nurturing their young,
**power** (德) is complete and can transform—
when cultivation of the self is finished,
this principle is applied to the household,
teaching wife and children to return to sincerity,
to find ease in poverty and delight in the Dao,
as vulgar habits fade and **virtue** (德行) renews daily,
**Dao-practice** (道业) flourishes—
thus it is **surplus**.

When virtue is cultivated **in the village** (修之乡),
its **power** (德) becomes **long-lasting** (长).
Those with the Dao dwelling in the village,
neighbors and kin admire them in awe,
superior and inferior recognize their order,
the greedy and competitive know moderation—
their **power** (德) grows ever stronger,
hence it is called **long-lasting**.

When virtue is cultivated **in the state** (修之国),
its **power** (德) becomes **abundant** (丰).
To govern the state with the Dao—
all receive its nourishment,
customs shift and morals ease,
people return to sincerity, goods overflow—
thus it is called **abundant**.

When virtue is cultivated **throughout the world** (修之天下),
its **power** (德) becomes **universal** (普).
Where the Dao resides,
its kindred spread like a lamp passed on—
no one is left unnurtured,
while I alone accumulate profound virtue.
Transformation reaches the far and near,
grace extends to the hidden and the manifest,
the humble and the lofty alike find peace,
the sluggish and the restless attain their nature—
nothing is left unbenefited,
hence it is called **universal**.

Thus, one observes the self **through the self** (以身观身),
the household **through the household** (以家观家),
the village **through the village** (以乡观乡),
the state **through the state** (以国观国),
the world **through the world** (以天下观天下).

To observe others,
first observe oneself—
yet observation has many methods.
Here, three are briefly stated:
**1. Observing with discernment** (有观),
**2. Observing with emptiness** (空观),
**3. Observing with truth** (真观).

**1. Observing with discernment** (有观)—
**Master of the Yellow River** (河上公) says:
*"Observe those who cultivate the Dao in their bodies
and those who do not—
who endures, who perishes?
The village, state, and world follow the same pattern.
Only by observing traces of endurance and ruin at the edges
can one know the difference between cultivation and neglect—
thus it is called **observing with discernment**."*

**2. Observing with emptiness** (空观)—
to observe the body as illusory and without true substance,
and thus settle one’s resolve.
The *Scripture* says:
*"The essential precept must know
that within the **Three Realms** (三界),
even the **Three Dynasties** (三代) are empty.
Though there is my body,
all must return to emptiness—
thus it is called **observing with emptiness**."*

**3. Observing with truth** (真观)—
then, one must observe according to this *Scripture*,
investigating:
*"From what did this body arise?
From whence did it come?
Whose child is it?
With what does it form its limbs and myriad parts?
Who governs its **qi** (气命) and **spirit** (精神)?
Seeking the *Scripture*’s principles,
tracing the Dao’s flow,
first, the **One Qi** (一气) of the *Scripture*,
then the **Yin-Yang** (阴阳) transformations,
the Dao as **spirit** (精神),
**Primordial Unity** (元和) as **qi** (气命),
**Yin-Yang** as the **substance** (质绪),
the **Great Dao** as the **master craftsman** (都匠).
Collecting these elements,
molding and refining them into the body—
the **heart** (心) is the **essence of Yin-Yang** (阴阳之精),
yet it is the master of cravings.
The **spirit** (神) is the **essence of the Dao** (至道之精),
yet it is the master of **qi** (气命).
In all the body’s functions,
nothing is left unaccounted for."*

All conditions converge,
each with its own refinement and coarseness.
The refined become sages and worthies,
the coarse become common and foolish—
even birds and beasts,
all encounter this by nature.

This is called the **initial body**.
From here onward,
life arises through form,
with sentience yet no feeling—
each a distinct lineage,
where evil gradually takes root,
and deeds accumulate like grass and trees.
Plants lack sentience,
their nature unchanging,
but humans and beasts, endowed with awareness,
flow through their deeds.

By this reasoning,
examine step by step—
clear and distinct.

Know that **Dao** is the **mother**,
for if **Dao** is the mother,
then one is her child.
Recognizing the mother,
one must return to her early.
Thus it is said:
*"The world has its beginning,
and it is the mother of the world."*

Having found the mother,
one knows her child.
Having known the child,
one must again guard the mother.
This is the true principle—
only the enlightened understand it,
hence it is called **true observation**.

Thus, one must cherish and preserve oneself,
not abandoning the **Dao’s** ways,
devoting the heart to serving the mother,
with sincere filial devotion.
Do not indulge desires or cling to defilements,
lest you fall into death’s snare,
and the **Dao’s** essence be lost in the Three Realms of Suffering.
Having known the mother,
do not casually seek her—
first, know where the mother resides,
what form she takes.

Now observe the mother’s nature:
neither existence nor nonexistence,
coming from nowhere,
vanishing without trace,
beyond all forms and images,
unfathomable in description.
Seeking beyond empty and full,
she cannot be confined by any measure.

Approaching, no head is seen;
following, no tail appears.
Flickering like a lost shadow,
one does not know where she goes.

Having observed the mother’s ineffable mystery,
she is truly worthy of reverence,
deep reflection, and diligent practice.

The essence of the **law** lies in:
not clinging to existence,
not clinging to nonexistence,
empty yet grounded,
solitary yet unmoving.
After long practice,
a serene contentment arises,
as if something were attained.
Comparing the heart to the mother,
the method of placement is:
emptiness and stillness align.
When the heart resembles the mother,
it merges with the **One**,
and the **Dao** reaches divine harmony—
thus, it feels as if something is gained.

When the mind dwells here,
it is like losing one’s home,
yet the **Primordial Pearl** is obtained—
all matters are complete.
What more is there to seek?

Having understood the body thus,
next observe family, nation,
even the world—
from true sages to the lowliest insects,
all share the same mother,
the same **qi**,
the same **law-nature**.

Confucius cherished his brothers,
yet did not consider them alone as kin,
for the *Scripture of Western Ascension* says:
*"The **Dao** is not confined to me alone—
all things possess it."*

All things are unaware,
yet the **Dao** dwells within them.
Observing the body through the body,
this is the key.

How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

The **Venerable Master** feigned asking me
to show how one attains knowledge—
yet even so, it remains as described.

Thus, this *Scripture* is the finest guide
for recognizing the mother,
the essential method for awakening to truth.
It unifies all things into **One**,
harmonizing heaven and earth into great unity—
only this *Scripture* holds this secret.

Though the *Scripture’s* principles are clear,
those who attain it must still practice.
Cease all thought and action,
abandon all striving,
and verify through **sitting-forgetfulness**.
Diligence is essential—
mere recitation leads to familiarity and confusion,
like striking the water to seek a shadow,
wasting effort on mere reflection.

Those who practice **emptiness** see emptiness
and thus remain untouched by all things.
Those who practice **true observation** recognize truth
and thus falsehoods naturally cease.

Yet the mind that sees emptiness
still opposes existence,
while true wisdom transcends both empty and full—
only by abandoning existence does one emerge beyond empty and full.

Words arise from principles,
principles resonate with sentiment—
when understood, no words remain.
Seek the harmony of intent and attainment.

---
**Chapter Eighteen: Containing Virtue**

Previously, it was explained how practicing the **Dao**
transforms the self and the world into harmony.
Now it is shown how **containing virtue** nurtures all things
without causing harm.

From humans to creatures,
there are two distinctions in order:
First, the pure and harmonious fills internally,
harming nothing externally.
Later, one knows harmony brings benefit
but does not yet understand how to avoid harm.

The first ten lines:
The depth of **containing virtue**
is like that of an infant.

Those who deeply embrace **virtue and the Dao**
are internally filled with harmonious **qi**,
and thus external evils cause no harm.
Their virtue is profound and distant,
unknown to others,
yet even infants recognize it—
hence the comparison.

Poisonous creatures do not sting,
ferocious beasts do not attack,
grasping birds do not seize.

Poisonous creatures—snakes and lizards—
snakes bite with their mouths,
lizards strike with their tails.
*"Sting"* refers to venomous action.
*"Grasp"* means to clutch and seize.
Some birds snatch prey with their claws
to carry it away for feeding.

Ferocious beasts—tigers and wolves—
do not harm those who embody **containing virtue**,
for harmonious **qi** influences all things,
reaching even this extent.

Their bones are weak, their sinews soft,
yet their grasp is firm.
An infant, newly born,
has no hair, its skin red and plump—
hence *"赤子"* (赤子).
At this stage, sinews and bones are frail,
yet when it closes its fingers around the thumb,
its grip is unyielding.
This is the natural result of undispersed harmony—
no effort is exerted, yet it is so.

Before knowing the union of male and female,
the infant’s loins stir—
the essence is at its peak.
*"朘"* refers to the infant’s yin stirring.
Male and female—yin and yang—
before understanding sexual union,
the infant’s yin moves—
a sign of harmonious **qi** overflowing,
not driven by lust.

It cries all day without hoarseness—
the ultimate harmony.
*"嘎"* means a voice that is rough or strained.
Though it cries endlessly,
its voice remains unbroken—
a proof of complete internal harmony.

The next seven lines:
Knowing harmony is constancy,
knowing constancy is enlightenment.

For harmony in the body—
its cries are unstrained,
poisons cause no harm—
those who recognize these benefits
must practice diligently each day,
treating harmony as an unbroken practice.
This is the unceasing path of cultivation.

闭者为能闻**Dao/Way**，境不乱心，欲食亦无所味，欲言亦无所道，
恣耳目之视听，不足见闻，放心神於有城，
寂然不动，中人闭塞，先事后理，
上士悛悟，心境齐忘，
心虚境无，诚谓善闭。
挫其锐，解其纷。
挫，折除也。

「纷，结恨也。
The **halitosis of emotions** (*fēn*) is the knotting of resentments.

六情外闭，三毒内销，
The Six **Emotions** (*liù qíng*) are closed externally, while the Three **Poisons** (*sān dú*) are extinguished internally—

道来居心，纷锐自息，
When the **Dao/Way** arrives and dwells in the mind, the **turbulence and sharpness** (*fēn ruì*) naturally subside;

昔有今无，由道挫解，
What once existed now vanishes, for the **Dao/Way** blunts and resolves it;

非谓尚在，将道销除。
It is not that it lingers—rather, the **Dao/Way** will extinguish and eliminate it.

和其光，同其尘。
To harmonize its **radiance** (*guāng*), to blend with the **dust** (*chén*).

此六句前文已有，
These six lines have already been mentioned in the preceding text—

今又言者，
Yet they are spoken again—

为其於人切要丁宁戒劝，
because they are of vital importance and earnest admonition for all people;

故再言之。
hence they are reiterated.

是谓玄同。
This is called **Mysterious Harmony** (*Xuán Tóng*).

玄者，无滞之名，
**"Mysterious"** (*Xuán*) is the name for that which is without obstruction—

是前诸行，内能知道，外能顺俗，
It is the prior practices: internally, one can **know and act** (*zhīdào*), externally, one can conform to the **dust** (*súshì*, i.e., worldly ways);

内外中间亦无住着，
Within and without, in the midst, there is no attachment;

与理冥一，
One merges indistinctly with the **principle** (*lǐ*)—

故云玄同。
hence it is called **Mysterious Harmony**.

下七句后。
The following seven lines are appended.

故不可得亲，
Thus, one cannot be **obtained as close** (*dé qīn*)—

不可得疏。
nor can one be **obtained as distant** (*dé shū*).

玄同之德，虚淡之士，
The **virtue/power** (*dé*) of **Mysterious Harmony**, the **serene and insipid** (*xūdàn*) sage—

神凝物表，志洽道源，
whose **spirit** (*shén*) condenses beyond the **phenomena** (*wùbiǎo*), whose **aspiration** (*zhì*) aligns with the **source of the Dao/Way** (*dàoyuán*)—

雅趣悬殊，
whose **lofty tastes** (*yǎqù*) diverge vastly—

故不可以俗情亲附。
hence one cannot be **attached by worldly affections** (*súqíng qīnfù*).

有道君子德芳兰桂，
A **virtuous/powerful** (*dé fāng*) **noble of the Dao/Way** (*yǒudào jūnzǐ*)—

近益体熏，
When near, one’s **body** (*tǐ*) is **perfumed** (*xūn*)—

望风愈疾，
and merely **encountering their presence** (*wàngfēng*) intensifies one’s **illness** (*jí*)—

故不可以常嫌疏远。
hence one cannot be **constantly repelled as distant** (*cháng xián shūyuǎn*).

不可得利，
One cannot be **obtained for gain** (*dé lì*)—

不可得害。
nor can one be **obtained for harm** (*dé hài*).

无营无欲，
Without **scheming** (*yíng*) or **desire** (*yù*)—

不可以财色利。」
one cannot be **obtained for wealth, sensuality, or gain** (*cáisè lì*).

「Without **fault** or **renown** (*guò míng*), one cannot be **obtained for harm through titles and names** (*xíngmíng hài*).

One cannot be **obtained for nobility** (*dé guì*), nor can one be **obtained for ignobility** (*dé jiàn*).

**Coarse and despised** (*bǐbó*), **honored and favored** (*róngchǒng*), one cannot be **obtained for rank and title** (*yuèmìng guì*).

A **virtuous/powerful noble of the Dao/Way** (*yǒudào kě zūn*) may be **revered**, yet one cannot be **compelled to serve as a common laborer** (*tóngsī yì jiàn*).

For **affection, repulsion, gain, and harm** (*qīncū lìhài*), these arise from those with **intent** (*yǒuxīn*).

Now that **all deliberations are utterly abandoned** (*wàn lǜ dū sǔn*), and **one’s mind is bereft of duality** (*dá yān sàng ǒu*), how could **gain, harm, nobility, or ignobility** (*lìhài guìjiàn*) ever reach them?

Hence, they are **held in highest esteem by all under heaven** (*wéi tiānxià guì*).

Those whom **all under heaven** can hold in esteem—
only **the previous conduct** (*qiánxíng*) qualifies.

**Supreme virtue** (*zhì dé gāomiǎo*) is lofty and boundless,
**playing in perfect harmony with the Dao/Way** (*xuán tóng qīngyuǎn*) is pure and distant—
**honor and gain cannot be bestowed upon them** (*rónglì bùnéng jiā*),
and **worldly affairs cannot sway them** (*súshì wúnéng dòng*).
If one **encounters this virtue by fortune** (*xìng féng cǐ dé*),
who could fail to **hold them in esteem** (*bùnéng guì*)?

The **six qualities above** (*yǐshàng liù zhě*)—
these are the **afflictions of the age** (*shìdài zhī yīng*) and the **common ailments of humanity** (*chángrén zhī huì*).
Only those who **embody the Dao/Way** (*dāng yǒudào zhě*) can **free themselves from them** (*fāngnéng miǎn yān*).

With **governance by the Dao/Way** (*yǐ zhèng zhāng*), the **twenty-second chapter** (*èrshí yī zhāng*)—

**First clarifying the three virtues** (*shǒu míng sāndé*) for **broad application** (*yòng guǎng*) and **distinct categories** (*jú bùtóng*),

**Next demonstrating through hypothetical inquiry** (*cì míng jiǎwèn zhī yóu*) the **verifiable principles** (*kě yàn*),

**Then showing that one’s self is merely not a wealthy nation or a refined populace** (*sān míng wǒ dàn bùzuò guófù rén chún*).
---
**Five sentences in one** (*wǔ jù yī*).
---
With **governance by the Dao/Way** (*yǐ zhèng zhī guó*),」

With **governance by the Dao/Way** (*yǐ zhèng zhī guó*), it refers to the **feudal lords** (*zhūhóu yě*). Governance (*zhèng*) encompasses **仁** (*rén*—benevolence), **義** (*yì*—righteousness), **礼** (*lǐ*—ritual/propriety), **信** (*xìn*—trustworthiness), **法令** (*fǎlìng*—laws and decrees), and **科条** (*kētiáo*—statutes and regulations), which serve as methods for **teaching and regulating the people** (*zhèngjiào lǐrén zhī fǎ*). Yet, those who implement them find it **burdensome** (*fán*), and those who follow them labor under their weight. Such governance may suffice for **small matters** (*lǐ xiǎo*), but it cannot **transform the great** (*huà dà*). Hence, it is called **governance** (*zhì guó*).

With **unconventional means** (*yǐ qí*) in **wielding arms** (*yòng bīng*), unconventional (*qí*) here means **deception** (*zhà yě*). Those who wield arms—such as the **four tyrants** (*sì xióng*) rebelling against humanity—defy **heavenly order** (*bèi luàn tiāncháng*), causing unrest among the **common folk** (*wànxìng bù ān*). In such times, **sound strategies** (*liángcè*) are needed. Yet, **using arms to maintain peace** (*yòng bīng jìng nán*) is a challenge even for the wise, who must take it up. When difficulty arises, **flexibility and deception** (*quándào guì zhà*) become paramount, though such tactics cannot be **prolonged** (*bùkě jiǔxíng*).

With **non-action** (*wúwéi wúshì*) in **acquiring the world** (*qǔ tiānxià*), acquiring the world (*qǔ tiānxià*) refers to **emperors and kings** (*dìwáng yě*). **Non-action and non-interference** (*wúwéi wúshì*) are the **virtue/power** (*dé*) of emperors and kings. When the heart **has no desires** (*wú suǒ yù*), and affairs **are left undone** (*shì wú suǒ wéi*), they do not **summon the people** (*zhào yú rén*), yet the people **return in admiration** (*bǎixìng guī mù*), and all directions **come in harmony** (*sìfāng tóng zhì*). This is because they do not **purposefully take** (*wéi yǒuxīn qǔdé*) the world, hence it is called **acquiring the world without interference** (*wúshì qǔ tiānxià*).

**Ten sentences in two** (*xià shí jù èr*).

How do I know the world is thus? **By this** (*yǐ cǐ*). How do I know? **This is inquiry** (*hé yǐ zhī, fā wèn yě*). The world is thus (*zhī rán*), just as it is (*yú rú shì yě*). By this (*yǐ cǐ*) means **judging and measuring these three matters** (*zhǐ cǐ sān shì jiàoliáng yǐ dáshì*).

**Deception, governance, and non-interference** (*qí zhèng wúshì*) are **talent** (*cái yě*). **Military, state, and worldly affairs** (*jūn guó tiānxià*) are **position** (*wèi yě*). When **position secures talent**, affairs are **regulated** (*shì lǐ*), and when **talent finds position**, the **Dao/Way is practiced** (*dào xíng*). Therefore, seeing **talent** reveals the **order or chaos** (*lǐ luàn*) of **position**, and observing **position** can distinguish the **superiority or inferiority** (*yōu liè*) of **talent**. Hence, it is said **by this** (*yǐ cǐ yě*).

The world **abounds in taboos** (*tiānxià duō jìhuì*), yet the people **grow ever poorer** (*mín mí pín*). This illustrates that **acquiring the world through interference** (*yǒushì qǔ tiānxià*) harms the people (*shēng xià jìhuì*), just as **excessive governance impoverishes the populace** (*shàng zhèng mí pín*). It clarifies that **harsh taboos and governance** (*xià shēng jìhuì fēi yī lèi*) are not of one kind, hence it is said **the world abounds** (*guó duō*).

Taboos (*jìhuì*) are **laws and decrees** (*fǎlìng yě*). Strict statutes and severe laws (*yán kē jùn fǎ*), dense as **congealed fat** (*mì ruò níng zhī*), cause **internal distress from hunger and cold** (*gōngshǒu zé nèi pò jīhán*) if one does nothing, and **external entanglement in punishments and ordinances** (*cóngshì zé wài luó xíngzhuàn*) if one acts. Now, **restricting affairs and imposing taboos** (*yǔ shì míng huì*) briefly refers to three types:

1. **Family and state taboos** (*jiāguó jìhuì*), where **speech loses its meaning** (*yán tán zé shī qí yì*).
2. **Yin and yang taboos** (*yīnyáng jìhuì*), where **actions lose their timing** (*wéishì zé shī qí shí*).
3. **Laws and decrees taboos** (*fǎlìng jìhuì*), where **livelihoods lose their occupation** (*yíngshēng zé shī qí yè*).

Though **laws are established to benefit the people** (*fǎ zhī suǒshè, běn nǐ rén*), if the people are **forced to comply**, it becomes **inconvenient for them** (*yǐ zhòng cóngjī, zé yú rén bù biàn*). Disobedience leads to **punishment**, while compliance results in **loss of benefit** (*fán zé fàn jìn, cóng zé shī lì*). Hence, **poverty** (*pín yě*).

**By this, it is verified** (*yǐ cǐ yàn zhī*), knowing that **they are not the sovereigns of non-interference** (*bù wéi wúshì zhī zhǔ*). If **conducting affairs with utmost propriety and no taboos** (*xíng zhì lǐ, bùhuì*) is practiced, then **all will prosper naturally** (*rén jiē zì fù*).

When the people **abound in clever devices** (*mín duō lìqì*), the state **grows more corrupt** (*guójīā hūn*). The people (*rén*) are the **general term for all ranks** (*guì biān zhī tōngchēng*). Clever devices (*lìqì*) refer to **schemes and stratagems** (*jīquán móucè*). Those capable of **harming others for personal gain** (*kān yǐ shēng rén yì jī*) are all called **clever devices** (*lìqì*). Yet, when **family and state** pursue **affairs and interference** (*hǎoshì yǒuwéi*), the **rulers value clever schemes and stratagems** (*shàng wù quánzhì yǐ jìn xià*), while the **common folk devise deceitful plots to defy the rulers** (*xià shēng jiān cè yǐ wǔ shàng*). Rulers and subjects **colluding in schemes**, not practicing the **Dao/Way of rectitude** (*bù xíng zhèngdào*), lead to **deception and falsehood among the populace** (*rénshù wěi wàng*), and **confusion and bewilderment among rulers and ministers** (*jūnchén hūn huò*).

When the people **abound in cleverness and ingenuity** (*mín duō zhìxiào*), **unconventional things proliferate** (*qí wù zī qǐ*). Proliferate (*zī*) means **to increase** (*yì yě*). Cleverness and ingenuity (*zhìxiào*) are **unconventional products of worry and labor** (*yōuláo zhī qíwù*), referring to those who **possess extraordinary cleverness and ingenuity** (*bùfēi yǒushì zhī tú*), delight in **unusual things** (*hǎo wéi yìwù*), and **compete in mutual boasting** (*jìng xiāng guā shàng*), daily **increasing their unconventional abilities** (*yìbiàn qí néng*). This is because the **rulers cherish the strange and unusual** (*shàng guì zhēn qí*), causing the **common folk to indulge in extravagance and excess** (*bǎixìng jiāo huā yì shèn*).

When **punishments and regulations proliferate** (*fǎwù zī zhāng*), **thieves and robbers abound** (*dào zéi duō yǒu*). Punishments and regulations (*fǎwù*) refer to **tools of penal law** (*xíngfá zhī jù*), such as **strict statutes and harsh laws** (*yán kē kù fǎ*), including **stocks, fetters, and flogging** (*jiāsuǒ zhuīchǔ zhī shǔ*). Though **applying punishments and regulations aims to prevent theft** (*shī fǎwù běn nǐ fàn dào*), when **harsh penal methods are excessive** (*chǔ fǎ duō ér dào zéi shèn*), it is because the **rulers favor strange and unusual things** (*shàng hǎo qíwù*), the **common folk have no choice but to steal** (*xià wú zé dào*). Even if the **legal net is dense** (*fǎwǎng suī mì*), thieves **grow ever more cunning** (*dào zéi mí qí*), and **offenders multiply** (*fàn dào zé zhòng*), hence it is said **thieves and robbers abound** (*dào zéi duō yǒu*).

**Five sentences in two** (*xià wǔ jù èr*).

Thus, the **sage** (*shèngrén*) proclaims: **"I practice non-action, yet the people transform themselves naturally"** (*wǒ wúwéi, mín zì huà*);

The **Sage** now elucidates how the **uninvolved** (*wúshì*) attains **my Heavenly Sovereign** (*wǒ tiānwáng*).

Suppose the **Heavenly Sovereign** declares:
*"I govern from above with non-action, and all under heaven naturally transform themselves."*

**Non-action** refers to **superior governance** (*shàng zhèng*), while **self-transformation** reveals the **people’s growth** (*xià yì*). This aligns with the **fourfold harmony** of principle—**self-evident**.

*"I have no affairs, yet the people grow rich."*
Above, there are **no taxes or corvée labor** (*shàng wú fùyì zhī shì*), and below, there are **no weary or disturbed people** (*xià wú láorǎo zhī rén*).
All households dwell in peace, the **four classes** (*sìmín*) resume their vocations—women at their looms, men at their plows. **Pure virtue** fills the heart, and **abundant grain** overflows the fields—hence, they are **rich**.

*"I cherish stillness, yet the people align themselves."*
People are like water: **still, they become clear and level**; level, they can **rectify all things**.
Stillness arises from **tranquility**—when the lower moves, the upper follows. **Desires and perversities are severed**, and people return to **simplicity and rectitude**.
As previously stated: *"Clarity and stillness are the rectification of all under heaven."*

*"I have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity."*
**Desire** begins with **covetousness and attachment**; **simplicity** is the **undivided purity of the heart** before dispersion.
If the **Sovereign** abandons desire, the people **cease greed and licentiousness**, weary of frivolous excess, and **naturally revert to their original simplicity**.

The **Laozi’s** teaching does not merely extol the benefits of **non-action** but contrasts it with the **harm caused by governance**. The **gains and losses of kingship** are mirrored here—**like the tortoise-shell and bronze divination** (*guījìng*).
**Chapter Twenty-One on Governance** follows:
Previously, it was shown how **transformation** leads to **deviance or purity** among people. Now it clarifies how **governance**, whether **lenient or severe**, leads to **completeness or deficiency**.
Though **excesses are not fully removed**, this is why it is **sequenced in three distinctions**:
First, it distinguishes **governance’s leniency or urgency** and their **benefits or harms**.
Second, it explains that **calamity and fortune cycle endlessly**, with **no ultimate limit**.
Third, it demonstrates how **non-action** governs by **rectifying oneself and leading others**.

**Four sentences in one.**

When **governance is slow and measured** (*qí zhèng mènmèn*), the people are **simple and sincere** (*qí mín chúnchún*).
*"Slow and measured"* means **lenient and relaxed**. Some texts read *"mǐnmǐn"* (蒙昧), with the same pronunciation as *"mén"* (门), meaning **obscured and ignorant**.
*"Simple and sincere"* means **unadorned and straightforward**. If the **Sovereign** is **dim like darkness**, and governance is **lenient and relaxed**, then the people **naturally become honest and thick-witted like the unlearned**.
**Turning from corruption back to simplicity** marks the **beginning of fortune**.

When **governance is sharp and scrutinizing** (*qí zhèng cháchá*), the people are **depleted and failing** (*qí mín quēquē*).
*"Sharp and scrutinizing"* marks the **onset of strict governance**. *"Depleted and failing"* follows **exhaustion and ruin**.
This is for those who **cultivate fortune through self-discipline**: when the **Sovereign’s heart is broad and still**, the **five viscera** are harmonious, the **hundred passages** are regulated—**all functions operate as they should**.
But if the **Sovereign is overly vigilant**, **external conduct falters**, and **inner vitality dissipates**, leading to **premature death**—hence, they are **depleted**.

**Eight sentences in two.**

**Calamity** is the **leaning of fortune**; **fortune** is the **hidden seed of calamity**.
*"Leaning"* means **dependence**; *"hidden"* means **concealed**.
**Calamity and fortune** are the **retributions of good and evil**.
If one **empties the heart** of all **good and evil**, then **having neither**, how could there be **fortune or calamity**?
But when the **heart engages in good or evil**, **fortune and calamity naturally arise**—**calamity clings to evil**, while **fortune lies within**, though **calamity is evident** and **fortune is concealed**.
If one **abandons evil and practices goodness**, then **fortune emerges from calamity**, and **calamity is concealed while fortune appears**—hence, *"calamity is the leaning of fortune."*
If one **indulges in fortune with arrogance and excess**, then **fortune vanishes and calamity arises**—**calamity is the hidden seed of fortune**.
As long as **good and evil persist**, **fortune and calamity will never cease**.
The **heart is the master of good and evil**; thus, **calamity and fortune depend on it**, both **existing within the heart**.
**Fortune and calamity are formless**—they arise **instantly with perception**. Who can **know their limits**? There is **no fixed measure**.
*"Measure"* refers to the **central principle**—the **heart**.
**Fortune comes from goodness**, and **calamity arises from evil**; **fortune and calamity cycle endlessly**—who can **know their bounds**?
It is because **partial and perverse hearts** **give rise to goodness and evil**, yet those who **forget goodness and evil** possess the **rectified heart**.
The **rectified heart** is **strange**, and **goodness is also strange**.
Though the **Sovereign’s heart may forget**, **goodness and evil remain as the rectified principle**—this is **not yet the ultimate rectitude**.
*"Strange"* differs from other **good and evil**; **not inviting fortune or calamity**, though **called good**, it is **not yet worthy of the Dao**. This is **strangeness** (*xiān*).
*"Strangeness"* is the **perverse path** (*dào zhī yé*).
**Conforming to the Dao** still leaves **residual defilement**; **dwelling in the world** leaves **remaining hatred**.
This is merely **self-imposed eccentricity**, not yet **true goodness**.
The **people’s delusion** has **lasted for ages**.
*"Strangeness"* is the **habit of clinging to rectitude**; *"perversity"* is the **calamity of fixating on goodness**.
**Nurturing illness without awareness**, hence called **delusion**.
**Abandoning perversity and clinging to rectitude** is like **being trapped in a sack**—hence, **fixed**.
From **calamity and fortune** to **perversity and goodness**, spanning **ages and eons**, hence called **long-lasting**.

The **Sage’s compassionate benevolence** will **rescue them**—this is elaborated below.

**Five sentences in three.**

Thus, the **Sage** is **square yet does not cut**, **sharp yet not defiled**.
*"Square"* means **rectified**; *"cut"* means **severed**.
*"Defiled"* means **evil**; some texts read *"shuài"* (刿), meaning **harm**.
All who **cling to rectitude or perversity** as their own **strange conduct**—the **Sage** practices **great rectitude**, blending **all teachings into one**, **not severing the crooked** to follow the straight, **self-sufficient in virtue**, **not seeking external purity**.
The **people’s greed and defilement** are **internalized as true purity**, yet still **contaminated by worldly habits**.

**Breaking the perverse yet not indulging**, **bright yet not dazzling**.
*"Indulging"* means **displaying**; the **body acts upright**, the **mouth does not proclaim**, **boasting or provoking greed**—these are **self-imposed eccentricities**.
Though **wisdom, virtue, and names** differ externally, their **inner essence is empty and forgotten**.

If **goodness is attained through empty forgetfulness**, then **fools will naturally perceive it**, and the **wise will emulate it**, **hiding their brilliance**—**not disturbing the masses**, **not coveting darkness**, **non-action’s transformation** is **greatly realized**.

**Chapter Twenty-Two on Governing the People** follows:
Previously, it was shown how **calamity and fortune have no end** due to **governance and teaching through action**.
Now it clarifies how **transformation** extends to **both people and the heavens** through **non-action’s principles**.
**Transformation precedes action**—this is why it is **sequenced in three distinctions** within the chapter:
First, it shows how **non-action’s principles** can **transform people and the heavens**.
Second, it demonstrates that **mastering non-action** can **secure a kingdom**.
Third, it reveals that **sustaining non-action** leads to **self-attained longevity**.

**Chapter Twenty-Two on Governing the People (continued)**

**Eleven Sentences (First Section):**
To govern both people and the heavens, nothing surpasses **establishing the Dao as the standard**.
*"Thus"* (及) means *"to reach"* (至).
*"Heavens"* (天) refers to **Nature’s spontaneity**.
Some manuscripts read *"affairs"* (事), meaning *"undertakings"* (事业).
*"Standard"* (式) means **Law/Principle**.
Earlier, it was said: *"The Sage embraces Oneness as the standard for the world."*
Some manuscripts read *"frugality"* (啬), meaning *"thrift,"* but mere frugality is insufficient to subdue the world, hence **Law/Principle** is the correct interpretation.

To transform the people and unify distant and near in harmonious intent—so that all may attain **Nature’s inherent order**—nothing surpasses employing the **Dao of non-action** as the standard.
Thus, people are all governed, and the heavens all aligned.
Those who take **undertakings** (事业) as transforming the myriad people, or who practice **non-action** as their undertaking—once they have won the hearts of the myriad people and aligned with **Nature’s Way**, they can truly subdue.

Only through **establishing the standard** can one achieve early submission.
*"Submission"* (伏) means *"to follow."*
To lead and transform the myriad people, so that the four quarters submit early—this is achieved solely by the **Law of non-action**, the most critical principle.
Early submission is called **"accumulating virtue"** (重积德).
*"Virtue"* (德) refers to the **manifestation of the Dao in action**, encompassing all virtues, ever-increasing and unceasing—this is **"accumulating virtue."**
Difficult-to-transform individuals submit early because this virtue is profound and vast, layered and thickly accumulated, hence they are won over.
**"Accumulating virtue"** ensures nothing is unconquered.
*"Conquer"* (克) means *"to achieve fruitfully."*
When virtue resides within, one can move the heavens and earth, and awaken spirits and gods—nothing resists, so where can one not conquer?
Nothing is unconquered—its extent is boundless.
When virtue is deeply accumulated, all things revere and honor it, following the wind and emulating the Dao—what limit can there be?
Its extent being unknown—this is how one secures a kingdom.
There are two meanings of *"unknown extent"*:
First, virtue is accumulated so deeply and broadly that its measure equals the boundless void, with no limits to gauge.
Second, the number of those who submit is countless—only when virtue reaches this magnitude can one rule as sovereign to nourish the people of a kingdom.

**Two Sentences (Second Section):**
The **Dao as the mother of a kingdom** ensures its enduring longevity.
The **Dao** has the function of **generation and nourishment**, hence it is called *"mother."*
If one possesses the **Dao** and applies it, governing the state will bring stability and prosperity to the people, with blessings enduring long.

**Two Sentences (Third Section):**
Thus, **deep roots and firm foundations** yield the **Dao of longevity and enduring vision**.
For those who have previously accumulated virtue, treating the **Dao as the mother of the kingdom** grants longevity—yet it has not yet explained how guarding the mother ensures enduring rule.
Now, the full method of **preserving life and securing the state** is fully expounded, warning of the benefits of governing well.
Wood, as a thing, has roots below and fruit above—deep roots make it unpluckable, firm foundations make it unfailing.
Those who accumulate virtue have the **Dao in their person** and **virtue in their heart**; guarding the **Dao through non-action** deepens their **life-root**.
Cultivating the heart to nourish virtue ensures **longevity**.
Firm foundations and deep roots ensure **life’s continuity**.
Firm foundations prevent bodily dissolution, extended life ensures **longevity**, and bodily integrity ensures **enduring vision**.
*"Longevity"* refers to the **body**, *"enduring vision"* to its **function**—thus it is known that **deep roots and firm foundations** yield the **Dao of longevity and enduring vision**.

---
**Chapter Twenty-Three on Governing a Great State**
Previously, it was shown how **non-action’s transformation** benefits the people and the heavens.
Now, it clarifies how **applying the Dao to govern** brings blessings to both humans and spirits.
Virtue permeates the hidden and the manifest—hence the chapter is structured in three distinctions:
First, it uses the analogy of cooking to show that **action is unworkable**.
Second, it directly explains the principle to demonstrate that **humans and spirits alike receive blessings**.
Third, it reveals how **virtue extends to the hidden and manifest**, uniting humans and spirits in kinship.

**Two Sentences (First Section):**
To govern a great state is like **cooking a small fish**.
*"Cook"* (烹) means *"to boil."*
*"Fish"* (腥) is sometimes read as *"fresh"* (鲜)—both refer to **small fish**.
Boiling a small fish: if left alone, it remains whole; if prodded, it breaks apart.
This illustrates that **governing a state cannot rely on action**.
If the ruler practices **non-action**, the world is governed and the state preserved.
If the ruler acts, the world falls into chaos and the state perishes.
The fate of the world—**preservation or ruin**—is a grave matter.
Yet many fail to understand.

「Cooking a small fish is a minor affair,
yet it serves to illustrate a great principle.

A state being so, how much more should one cultivating **virtue** dare to act with **hasu**!

**Six sentences in three:**

When the **Dao/Way** is applied to govern the world,
its spirits do not become **shen**—*[**shen**: divine, supernatural, or awe-inspiring]*.
**Govern** (*莅*) means **to rule over** (*临*).
Those who rule the world with the **non-action** **Dao/Way**—
not only do humans cease their wickedness,
and those who rebel are punished for offending above—
but also the spirits below do not become **shen**,
and those who **feng** (*祟*) harm people are restrained.
It is not that the spirits lack **shen** and thus do not harm people,
but that the ruler above possesses **virtue/power** and **moral authority**,
and the spirits below dare not act with reckless **jingshen** (*精邪*)—*[**jingshen**: malevolent spiritual forces]*.
Nor is it that the spirits lack **shen** and thus do not harm people,
for the **sage** does not harm people either.
This demonstrates that the **sage’s** merit is the true cause,
not that the spirits inherently lack **shen** and thus do not harm people.
Rather, it is because they are blessed by the **sage’s** transformation,
and the spirits, moved by gratitude, act with propriety,
not daring to harm people.

**Two sentences in three:**

When both do not harm each other,
**virtue/power** flows in mutual exchange.
Both refers to **humans and spirits**.
Humans, when they do not **dig graves** (*掘冢*), **mutilate corpses** (*戮尸*), or **scold** (*诃骂*) the spirits,
this is humans not harming spirits.
Spirits, when they do not bring **disasters** (*灾*), **ominous portents** (*怪*), **calamities** (*祸*), or **feng** (*祟*) upon humans,
this is spirits not harming humans.
Humans, when they follow the **Dao/Way** in the world,
and their kindness extends even to the **white bones** (*白骨*—the dead),
and they perform sacrifices at the proper times,
then **virtue/power** flows from humans to spirits.
Spirits, when they guard and bless humans with their **shen** and **ling** (*灵*—numinous, spiritual),
then **virtue/power** flows from spirits to humans.
Thus, there is no calamity between them,
but blessings are shared in mutual exchange.

**Chapter Twenty-Four of the Great State:**
The previous section illustrated that when the **Dao/Way** rules over all,
humans and spirits alike receive blessings.
This section reveals how a great state practices **humility** (*谦*) and **harmony** (*华夷*—civilized and barbaric peoples),
and all nations are drawn by its **virtue/power**.

The first distinction shows that **great humility** overcomes arrogance,
the second that both great and small nations practice humility,
and the third that a great state must particularly guard against arrogance.

**Four sentences in one:**

A great state is the **lower stream** (*下流*—the receiving end),
the **gathering place** (*交*) of the world.
Wide lands and many people make it a great state.
Humility and self-abasing make it the **lower stream**.
Small states, admiring its **virtue/power**, vie to come and assemble.
The **gathering place** of the world:
the **yin** (*牝*—receptive, yielding) always triumphs over the **yang** (*牡*—assertive, aggressive).

**Yin** and **yang**—the yielding and the harmonious—
are those who practice **humility**.
The **yang**—the forceful, violent, and aggressive—
illustrates those who boast and compete.
The **yin**, when it is yielding and humble,
then the world’s nations come to assemble,
and thus it is victorious.
The **yang**, when it is forceful, violent, and aggressive,
then people all rebel and scatter,
and thus it is inferior.

**Eight sentences in two:**

Thus, when a great state humbles itself to small states,
it wins them over.
A great state, when it humbles itself to small states,
then the small states come to join it.
One cultivating **virtue**—when the heart is humble and yielding—
then the people all come to revere and look up to them.
**Wang Dai** (*王骀*—a legendary sage) gathered crowds,
and this was his way.

Small states humbling themselves to great states,
then they are gathered by the great states.
Small states, knowing their own inferiority and weakness,
use humble words and bend their conduct,
submitting to serve the great states,
and thus they are able to assemble within the great states.
They seek **favorable winds** (*钦风*—auspicious influence) and **request guidance** (*请益*—ask for instruction),
just as the **lower streams** (*小见*—minor tributaries) remove their narrow confines,
admiring the vast and distant,
sending their own people inward
and inquiring about those who follow the **Dao/Way** externally,
not boasting of their own strength but practicing **humility** and **self-effacement**,
pushing others forward—
this is the **lower stream** of such a person.

Thus, there are those who humble themselves and win,
and those who humble themselves and gather.
**Or** (*或*—sometimes) refers to the indeterminate.
Though great and small differ,
both practice **humility**.
The great win over the small states,
the small are gathered by the great states.
Humility is the same,
but winning and gathering differ,
and thus it is said **or**.

The intent of the great state’s **humility**
does not exceed the desire to **comprehensively nurture** (*兼畜*—to embrace and protect) all people.
The intent of the small states
does not exceed the desire to **enter into service** (*入事*—to submit and be governed).
The **humility** of the great state is without excess,
only desiring to embrace and protect the people of small states.
The **humility** of the small states is also without excess,
only desiring to serve the great state.

**Humility** is the **Dao/Way** for establishing oneself,
how could it be that one only practices **humility**
after desiring to **nurture and serve** others?
Now, for both great and small to practice **humility**,
the **qi** of like minds resonates—
the small entering the great is like returning home,
the great embracing the small is like nurturing one’s own children.
Their emotions are fulfilled,
their intentions harmonious,
all stemming from **humility**—
nearby people are united,
distant nations are aligned.
The **sage’s** teachings vary in depth,
to lure people in and strengthen the resolute.
Even the **forceful and aggressive** (*强梁*) are urged to speak,
but their intent is only to **nurture and serve** others.

**Four sentences in three:**

Thus, both parties attain what they desire.

The two parties—great and small states—
the great desires to **nurture and serve** the small, now already attains it,
the small desires to **nurture and serve** the great, now again attains it.
Both fulfill their wishes, hence it is said each attains its desire.
Therefore, the great ought to be the humble one.
The great and small practice **humility**,
from ancient times, humility has been inherent.
Now, it is emphasized again that the great ought to be humble,
for fear that **humility** may not endure long,
and lest the great should **overwhelm** the small.
Thus, a separate precept is given to the great,
to ensure they begin and end well.

**Chapter Twenty-Five of the *Dao* (Way):**
The great **Dao/Way** returns all under Heaven to **revere** the **Virtuous One** (*大人*),
this reveals the **Way**’s supreme **virtue/power** (*至道*)—formless yet embracing life’s shared treasure.
The **Way** of **virtue/power** (*从德之道*) is explained in four distinctions:
First, the profound and mysterious essence of the **Dao/Way** is treasured only by the worthy.
Second, the unworthy—foolish and dim—hold it lightly and do not cherish it.
Third, the **sage’s** heart is equally balanced, universally saving without neglect.
Fourth, seeking it is easy, and those with faults are all absolved.

**Three sentences in one:**
The **Dao/Way** is the profound essence of all things,
the treasure of the virtuous.

The essence (*奥*) is a deep chamber.
The **Dao/Way**’s profound mystery,
like the depths of a chamber,
is immeasurable.

Those who follow the **Dao/Way** yet do not know it,
those who bear the **Dao/Way** within yet do not recognize it,
are truly foolish.
The **Dao/Way**’s essence, unperceived and uncherished,
is only treasured by the wise and refined—
the truly virtuous alone can prize and love it.

**Four sentences in two:**
The unworthy do not treasure it.
The unworthy are the lesser folk.
Their actions are crooked and evil,
thus they are called unworthy.

Their hearts lack clarity and wisdom,
so they do not treasure it.

Sweet words can buy gain,
noble conduct can elevate others.
The petty seek profit through flattery,
pleasing those before them with smooth speech,
like merchants haggling for cheap bargains.

The noble vie for reputation through virtue,
their conduct lofty, their intent to uplift others,
to win hearts with noble deeds,
to surpass others in virtue.

These are not the virtuous,
but those without the **Dao/Way**.

**Seven sentences in three:**
How could one abandon the unworthy?
The unworthy are not joyful in nature.
Their minds are clouded and unaware,
so they should not be cast aside.
Teaching through expedient means,
they may yet have hope.

Thus, the **Son of Heaven** (*天子*) is established,
and the Three Exalted Ministers (*三公*) are appointed—
the ministers of **teaching** (*师*), **nurturing** (*傅*), and **protection** (*保*).
Since they are not abandoned,
there must be methods to guide them.
With expedient governance and restraint,
he offers lavish rewards to encourage virtue,
and severe punishments to halt evil—
this is the **Son of Heaven**’s way of not abandoning them.

Even with **jewel-embracing** (*拱璧*) and **four-horsed chariots** (*先驷马*),
it is not as good as sitting in **forgetting** (*坐进*) this **Dao/Way**.
This **Dao/Way** is the profound essence of all things,
the treasure of the virtuous.

**Jewel-embracing** (*拱璧*)—as when two hands join to hold a **jewel**—
**Four-horsed chariots** (*驷马*)—the steeds that lead a **Son of Heaven**’s carriage.
At rest, the **jewel** fills one’s sight,
in motion, the chariots precede.
Truly the height of wealth and honor,
yet still not as good as **non-action** (*无为*) and **forgetting** (*坐忘*), advancing in wondrous **Dao/Way**.

Why so?
The splendor of **jewel** and **chariot** is not free from care,
but through **forgetting** and **advancing in the Dao**,
one attains the **Divine** (*神*) and the **True** (*真*).
By this measure,
the latter is far superior.

This exhorts the **Son of Heaven** and the Three Exalted Ministers
to advance in the **supreme Dao/Way**,
to transform the unworthy into abandoning evil,
and now to transform the rulers into abandoning virtue.

**Four sentences in four:**
What makes the ancient **Dao/Way** so honored?
Is it not that seeking it brings attainment,
and faults are pardoned?

Thus, it is prized by all under Heaven.
This reveals the benefits of cultivating the **Dao/Way**,
not that one must seek to gain it—
no need for laborious body or mind,
daily searching afar to call it attainment.

The **Dao/Way** comes naturally through **non-action** and **forgetting**,
thus it is called attainment.
The *Sutra of Western Ascension* (*西升经*) says:
*"If a person can be empty and do nothing,
the **Dao/Way** will naturally return to them.*
Faults are the retribution of past evil,
but through **forgetting** (*坐忘*), they are naturally extinguished.
It is not said one must seek to gain clarity—
attainment is effortless.
To absolve faults and extinguish evil is not difficult,
with such divine efficacy,
the ancient **sages** and **worthy kings** all held it in highest esteem.

**Chapter Twenty-Six of the *Dao* (Way):**
This reveals that the profound essence of the **Dao/Way** is attained without effort,
now it is explained that **non-action** alone can cultivate it.

It must be elaborated on how attainment comes,
thus three distinctions are given:
First, **non-action**’s practice can **repay enmity with virtue** (*以德报冤*).
Second, **non-action**’s heart is hard to stir—great deeds do not arise.
Third, the **sage** transcends all signs and portents—no calamities are born.

**Five sentences in one:**
**Non-action** (*无为*) is **non-action** (*为无*).
**Non-action**’s flavor (*味无味*) is **non-action** (*无味*).

**Action** and **flavor** are the common pursuits of people.
**Non-action**, **non-action**’s practice, and **non-action**’s flavor—
these are the **Dao/Way**’s work.

Those advancing in **virtue/power** (*进德*) regard these three as their true calling,
thus they attain the **Dao/Way**.
All who stray from the **Dao/Way** and incur faults
do so because of **action**, **pursuits**, and **flavor**.

Now, to avoid faults and attain the **Dao/Way**,
one must abandon **action** and embrace **non-action**—
this is the **Dao/Way**’s heart.

To cease all scheming and contriving,
to take **non-action** as one’s practice—
this is the **Dao/Way**’s body.

To reject richness and delicacy,
to cut off all **flavor**,
to partake in the **Dao/Way**’s mystery—
this is the **Dao/Way**’s mouth.

The **Dao/Way**’s body and mouth
are the roots of **action** and **flavor**,
but its foundation is the heart.
If the heart attains **emptiness** and **forgetting**,
all burdens are cast off—
why single out **action** and **flavor**?

Great or small, many or few,
**repay enmity with virtue** (*报怨以德*).
The great and small refer to the **Dao/Way**’s **action** and **flavor**.
The many and few refer to the **Dao/Way**’s quantity.
To encroach on reputation and profit is small,
to slay or harm others is great.
**Enmity** (*怨*) is resentment and grudge.
Even if one’s **action** is small yet can become great,
if few can accumulate into many,
one small act turning great is still hard to undo—
how much more so if few accumulate into many?

Only through **non-action** can past faults be daily erased,
and new deeds permanently severed,
thus through **virtue** one **repays enmity** with the old,
and all resentment is fully extinguished.
Hence it is said: **"Repay enmity with virtue."**

**Eight sentences in two:**
To plot against the difficult through the easy,
to act great through the small.
The difficult is the retribution of faults,
the easy is the small cause.

The person of **non-action** and **non-doing** has already severed all causes—
no faults arise from nothing.
As for those who act and do things,
their initial causes are still small—
they should be immediately severed and extinguished,
for effort is slight and easy to complete.
If not cut off early, they grow into great matters,
their deeds becoming heavy and difficult to undo.

All great difficulties in the world begin in the easy,
all great matters arise from the small.
*"Action"* means *"to initiate."*
When it says *"the world,"*
it means all difficult and great matters
originate from easy and small beginnings.
Since their forms and kinds are numerous,
they cannot be exhaustively listed—
thus, *"the world"* encompasses them all.

He who makes light of promises will lack trustworthiness,
he who multiplies ease will invite difficulty.
*"He"* is a general term.
*"Promise"* means *"to agree."*
Those who lightly agree with others
make their words easy to speak.
But without corresponding action,
they inevitably break their word—
thus, they lack trustworthiness.
When they break their word,
others take offense,
and resentment and anger arise—
hence, they invite difficulty.

Earlier, I spoke of matters and things;
now, I turn to human tendencies—
all speak of ease leading to difficulty,
urging early severance while causes are still small.

**Eight sentences in three:**
Thus, even the **Sage** finds it difficult,
and so never encounters difficulty.
The **Sage** knows that light promises
often lack sincerity,
self-inviting future calamities,
never extinguishing prior causes—
therefore, the **Sage** exercises caution even in difficulty,
avoiding suffering from misfortune and easy causes.
The **Sage** does not act lightly,
while common folk are shallow and careless—
how much less should they be warned?
These are words urging the common through the **Sage’s** example,
not implying the **Sage** fears thus.

---
**Chapter Twenty-Seven: On Stability**

Earlier, it was shown that accumulated habits of **non-action** extinguish resentment and calamity.
Now, it is made clear that if the mind is undisturbed,
no misfortune will arise.
Before and after, the same principle connects—
four distinctions arise:
First, the mind at rest, desires unarisen;
Second, small causes unchecked accumulate into ruin;
Third, the **Sage’s** lack of failure stems from adhering to **non-action**;
Fourth, learning to sever and aid innate nature.

**Six sentences in one:**

Its stability is easy to maintain,
its unmanifested state easy to plan.
*"Maintain"* means to preserve what is established;
*"plan"* means to be cautious with what is new.
When at rest, the mind is still and empty,
not yet disturbed—
maintaining it is effortless.
Next, when the mind is barely stirred,
not yet attached to anything,
the mind and matters are not yet entangled—
at this stage, severance is effortless and requires little force.
How could it not be easy?

Its fragility is easy to shatter,
its subtlety easy to disperse.
*"Subtle"* refers to what arises from non-being,
already manifesting in form and appearance,
light and insubstantial—
easy to dissipate.
If not severed now, it gradually coalesces.
Though it has form, its substance is still weak—
to break it is not difficult.

These four sentences discuss the mind’s shift
from non-being to manifestation,
from subtlety to attachment—
all urging early intervention,
for matters are easy when small.
If not severed early,
they grow, expanding beyond control.

Why does subtlety precede attachment?
Because subtle *qi* is light and insubstantial,
nearly indistinguishable from non-being,
its form fragile like smoke or dust—
thus, its early stage is known.

Its fragility, though not yet firm,
has already begun to decay—
this is what is meant by *"easy."*
Though its segments remain,
time has passed, and attachment has taken root.
By this reasoning, subtlety is known to precede.

Earlier, it spoke of stability and the unmanifested;
later, of the unarisen and the undisturbed—
these four sentences reverse the order:
first coarse, then subtle.
Yet in structure, *"subtle"* follows *"fragile"*—
perhaps the recorder of the *Classic* erred.
If this were the **Sage’s** original intent,
I am too dull to discern.

*"To act before it arises,"*
*"to regulate before it is disturbed."*
*"Before it arises"* means when the mind is undisturbed.
*"Before it is disturbed"* means when the mind is untainted.

These two sentences recapitulate *"stability"* and *"the unmanifested,"*
leading into what follows.
If one can regulate while at rest,
no disturbance will arise.
If one can extinguish when it first appears,
it will not reach subtlety or fragility.
If subtlety and fragility are broken early,
they will not grow to the thickness of a man’s embrace.
Small faults accumulate into great ones—
calamity originates from the minute.
All causes of disaster are laid out in order,
to be systematically severed and dispelled.
If one does not trust and guards desire,
how should one proceed?

**Eight sentences in two:**

A tree thick enough to embrace
grows from a tiny sprout.
*"Embrace"* speaks of greatness;
*"sprout"* speaks of smallness.
Today’s greatness comes from yesterday’s smallness—
if the small is not severed,
it gradually becomes today’s greatness.
When great, even a gust of wind obscures the sun—
its removal is finally impossible.
This illustrates how initial thoughts, though slight as a sprout,
if nurtured, grow vast and deep,
shading the true nature like a courtyard tree.

A nine-layered tower
begins with a single basket of earth.
*"Layer"* means *"stacked."*
A nine-tiered tower starts with one basket of soil,
accumulated without pause,
until nine layers rise.
This shows how present-life sins
become towering and vast.

A height of a hundred *rèn*
begins at one’s feet.
Seven *chi* make a *rèn*;
ascending a mountain begins with lifting one foot,
step by step, until a hundred *rèn* is reached.
This illustrates that from now onward,
if evil is not halted,
each step compounds the height—
like piling earth from the ground up.

Nine layers, a hundred *rèn*—
this is perilous height.
From small beginnings, it ascends to ruin.
Some texts say *"a thousand-*li* journey,"*
but *"hundred *rèn*"* and *"thousand-*li*"* share similar meaning.
Yet ancient texts paired *"nine layers"* with *"hundred"*—
both rising from below—
so *"thousand-*li*"* was likely a later alteration.
Now, *"hundred *rèn*"* is retained as definitive.

*"To act"* leads to ruin,
*"to grasp"* leads to loss.
*"To act"* means to pursue and chase;
*"to grasp"* means to cling without release.
Pursuing without cease brings ruin to self and affairs.
Clinging without release brings loss of life and wealth.
If subtlety and fragility are not severed,
ruin and loss are inevitable.

「The seven lower sentences are three in number.
Thus, the Sage has no *forcing* hence no *ruin*,
no *grasping* hence no *loss*.
The Sage’s *ruin* and *loss* come from the commoner’s *forcing* and *grasping*;
to prevent people from *ruin* and *loss*,
the Sage himself speaks of *non-forcing* and *non-grasping*.

Those who meet with *ruin* must do so at *completion*.
But if there is no *forcing*, there is no *completion*.
Without *completion*, where is *ruin* to come from?
Those who suffer *loss* must do so through *acquisition*.
If I do not *grasp* or *take*, then there is no *acquisition*.
Without *acquisition*, where is *loss* to come from?
This is why, when the subtle and fragile are not early severed,
*ruin* and *loss* are inevitable.

The Sage’s words of *non-forcing* and *non-grasping*
can safeguard the original mind—
no *ruin*, no *loss*,
clearly avoiding all subsequent calamities.

People’s undertakings
often falter just as they near *completion*.
*Few* (几) means *near* (近).
*From* (从) means *to act* (行).
People’s actions, whether in Dao or worldly matters,
have many beginnings but few who can finish.
When their undertakings are near *completion*,
they are already self-destructing.
*Forcing* affairs never lasts long,
while *non-forcing* can endure to the end.
To lack an end is to meet with *ruin*—
this is the constant principle of Heaven.
If one treats the end as the beginning,
then there will be no *ruin* in affairs.
The nature of the mediocre person
is to begin but not to finish.
At first, they may have resolve,
but soon they falter and decline.
If one can persist in the initial resolve,
seeing the *ruin* of unfinished ends
and heeding the warning at the end,
then the Dao can truly be attained—
how much more so for worldly matters!

The four lower sentences are four in number.
Thus, the Sage desires what the desiring despise,
and does not value hard-to-obtain wealth.
Hard-to-obtain wealth is prized by the greedy,
but despised by those without desire.
Therefore, commoners, when they desire,
value what is hard to obtain and greedily cling to it,
leading to *ruin* and *loss*.
The Sage, when acting, desires what the desiring despise
and leaves hard-to-obtain things behind—
thus, no *ruin* or *loss* occurs.

Yet in the Sage,
there is no duality of desire or non-desire—
only the desiring are deceived into thinking
the Sage desires what the non-desiring despise,
so that all desiring may emulate his non-desire
and avoid *ruin* and *loss*.

To study or not to study,
prevents the errors of the multitude.
*Prevent* (备) means *to guard against* (防).
The multitude’s errors are not confined to one path.
Briefly, this speaks to their essential flaw.

The root of greed lies in the desire to learn what one desires,
yet non-desire is used to guide the petty.
The scholar’s source of distinction arises from learning,
yet non-learning is used to encourage the virtuous.
To uproot the root and block the source,
then people will have no contention or theft,
no action or strife—
the world will unite in virtue,
and wealth will be held cheap while learning is abandoned—
its benefit lies here.

To aid the natural unfolding of all things
without daring to act.
Naturalness is the innate essence of things.
When desire and learning harm this essence,
removing desire and learning restores it—
thus, aiding the naturalness of all things.
When speaking of "all things," even the lifeless are included.
Human excess in desire harms oneself,
and extends harm to the lifeless.
When humans abandon desire and learning,
the essence of things remains whole.
Thus, encompassing all things.

Those who speak thus intend to save all things,
daring not to act for their own gain.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight of the Ancient Text**
Previously, it was made clear that action and contrivance lead to self-ruin.
Now, it is made clear that following the Dao,
abandoning cleverness and eliminating harm,
nothing arises.

Teaching through stillness,
aligning with the Mysterious Virtue—
there are three distinctions:
First, abandoning cleverness as if in foolishness,
so that errors do not arise.
Second, using cleverness without measuring gain or loss.
Third, knowing gain and loss reveals profound virtue.

Five sentences make one meaning.

The ancients who excelled in the Dao
did not seek to enlighten people—
they sought to make them foolish.
*For* (wei) means *to cultivate* (xiu).
The ancients who cultivated the Dao well
internally cultivated virtue,
concealing their brilliance and hiding their radiance,
appearing foolish.
They did not desire to reveal their clarity to others,
lest the multitude revere cleverness and wisdom,
damaging others to benefit themselves.
Those who cultivate the Dao make themselves foolish and obscure,
benefiting both self and others—
this is the path of entering the Dao.
Thus, it is said they excel.

Thieves and robbers are minor harms.
The clever disrupting the masses are major harms.
Eliminating major harms prevents minor ones from arising,
so by making oneself foolish,
cleverness’s harm is removed.

The difficulty in governing people lies in their excess cleverness.
The ruler uses cleverness, the subjects use deceit.
Deceitful cunning is manifold,
falsehoods are not singular.
They seek honor and favor in advancement,
avoiding punishment in retreat.
The more refined the nets of law,
the more cunning the evaders.
The people’s difficulty in being restrained
comes from the ruler’s use of cleverness in governance.

Thus, governing with cleverness is the state’s ruin.
Not governing with cleverness is the state’s virtue.

Cleverness has two forms:
Dao-cleverness and worldly cleverness.
Dao-cleverness is a mind aligned with the Dao’s path,
treating excess as the highest practice,
and non-action as supreme achievement.
Worldly cleverness lacks Dao-knowledge but has keen perception.
The unvirtuous harbor deceit to seek reward.
The crafty use cleverness to provoke punishment.
Above and below deceive and betray each other,
mutually harming and benefiting.
The greatest ruin of the state stems from cleverness’s influence.

Those who do not use cleverness
govern through non-action, measuring the pure and the simple,
taking without sullying integrity,
giving without demanding repayment—
when the people reach this state,
it is due to the ruler’s virtue.

Understanding these two paths
is the model.
The two paths refer to using cleverness and not using it.
Speaking of "also" (yì) refers to the preceding text,
which spoke of governing through non-action,
now reiterating "not using cleverness" to govern.
Knowing that using cleverness is the state’s ruin,
and not using cleverness is the virtue of nurturing people—
this is the method for governing the state and cultivating oneself.
Always knowing this model
is called Mysterious Virtue.
Beginning to end, without change, is called constancy.
Knowing not to use cleverness
can be the method for governing the state and cultivating oneself.
Consistently practicing it without cessation
is the supreme virtue of aligning with the Mysterious Dao.

Mysterious Virtue is profound and far-reaching,
contrary to the ways of things,
only then reaching the Great Harmony.
"Profound" speaks to its depth,
"far-reaching" to its breadth.
Its virtue is thus called Mysterious.
The Dao permeates the hidden and the manifest,
virtue fills the universe—
this is called far-reaching.
Common people value cleverness,
Mysterious Virtue values foolishness.
Common people value accumulation,
Mysterious Virtue values dispersion.
Common people follow convention,
Mysterious Virtue follows the Dao—
thus, it is called contrary.
Its path always brings peace to the state and benefits the people—
thus, it is called Great Harmony.

*"The people do not fear death,
yet rulers impose executions and punishments.
The people suffer hunger,
yet rulers levy heavy taxes.
Excesses stem from the ruler—
thus, the sage must be cautious in season.
The chapter presents three distinctions:
First, it explains that burdensome levies and labor drain both wealth and virtue,
Next, that indulgence in life shortens one’s days through self-neglect,
And finally, that forgetting life brings longevity—
this surpasses the value placed on life itself."*

Six sentences, one meaning.

*"The people’s hunger arises
from the ruler’s excessive consumption and taxes.
Consumption refers to lavish expenditures,
taxes refer to burdensome levies.
When the common folk are destitute,
with none to provide them food,
it is surely because the ruler’s spending is unrestrained,
taxes are excessive,
external labor exhausts them,
and internal reserves are depleted—
thus, they hunger.
The first sentence reveals the emptiness of the state’s foundation,
the second shows the cause of its troubles,
the third leads to the conclusion,
and the fourth seals the overarching principle."*

*"The people’s difficulty in governance stems
from the ruler’s excessive actions—
thus, they are difficult to govern.
When moral teachings flow downward from above,
the people conform from below.
If food and wealth are insufficient, they turn to theft and strife;
if desires and competition overflow, they indulge in deceit and fraud,
and falsehoods proliferate—
thus, they are difficult to govern.
The first sentence shows that the more one avoids [excess], the more secure the retreat,
the second that the more one restrains [the people], the more cunning the assault,
and the third concludes the reasoning."*

Three sentences below, two in meaning.

The people’s disregard for death arises from their excessive pursuit of life—
thus, they scorn death.
Long enduring hunger and cold, constantly fearing want,
they resort to means without the Dao.
Public punishments and private vengeance,
indulging beyond measure, harming life and nature—
though people may despise death themselves,
ultimately, it is governance and teaching that drive them thus.
Hence, it is known that imparting instruction must not be coercive.

Two sentences below, three in meaning.

Only those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.
*"Wise"* means *"good."*
Those who do not cling to life are those who forget life.
Excessive greed for nourishment swiftly leads to death—
only those who forget life surpass those who cling to life.
To forget life while living is the greatest good—
thus, they are called *"wise."*

**Chapter Thirty-Nine of Human Nature**
Previously, it was shown that resolving to live while forgetting life is superior;
now, it is shown that desiring life and avoiding death through gentleness is skillful.
Having already spoken of excessive nourishment and forgetting life,
now it speaks of firmness and entering death—
both share the same *qi*, hence the two distinctions follow.
The first uses analogy to explain firmness and entering death, gentleness and living,
while the second concludes that the rigid do not surpass the gentle.

Five sentences, one meaning.

Human life is gentle and weak,
but death is firm and strong.
Life possesses harmonious *qi*, then sinews and bones are supple and yielding.
When death comes, harmonious *qi* departs the body,
and limbs become rigid and hard.
By contrasting death with life, it is shown that the gentle prevail,
while the strong and bold are inferior.
All things—grasses and trees—
in life are gentle and fragile,
but in death, they wither and stiffen.
Speaking of *"all things"* encompasses both sentient and insentient.
Humans and grasses alike, when *qi* is severed, their forms become firm and strong,
while in life, their forms are entirely gentle and weak.
This is an illustrative analogy.

Six sentences, two meanings.

Thus, the firm and strong are of death’s kind,
while the gentle and weak are of life’s kind.
The nature of rigidity and harshness
goes wherever it will—
some are bold and domineering over others,
some forcibly seize what they desire,
their will fixed on gain, fearless of danger.
Though perilous, they press forward;
though strong, they still overreach—
these are called *"walking corpses,"*
akin to the dead.

The gentle and weak, though death may not spare them,
walk as those who seek longevity do—
this is the proper teaching.
Thus, the strong in arms are not victorious,
the strong in wood are split.
These two examples serve as proof.
The strong in arms: when many attack, they are annihilated and do not prevail.
The strong in wood: when pressed by clay and tiles, they break.
Hence, the rigid and strong are beneath,
while the gentle and weak are above.
The strong in arms: when many attack, they are subdued by strength,
while the gentle and weak: when in peril, others aid them;
when harmonious, others uphold them—
thus, they are above.

**Chapter Forty of Heaven’s Nature**
Previously, it was shown that discarding strength and embracing weakness is the way to life;
now, it is shown that suppressing the high and elevating the low
to attain the middle path is essential.
The first is crude, the second refined—
hence, the four distinctions follow:
first, using analogy to show that the Dao seeks the balanced middle;
second, that Heaven benefits through humility while humans benefit through excess and deficiency;
third, that only through methodical self-abnegation and benefiting others can one achieve it;
fourth, that the sage’s wisdom forgets merit and conceals virtue.

Six sentences, one meaning.

Heaven’s Way is like drawing a bow:
the high are lowered, the low are raised,
the excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.
Heaven’s principles are profound and distant—
no one can fathom them.
The analogy of the bow is given
to make it comprehensible to all.
Yet the bow’s true purpose lies in its tuning.
Whether tuned or not is only seen when drawn—
pulling, releasing, loosening—
observing whether it is tuned or not.
When the grip is high, it lowers the bow;
when the grip is low, it raises it.
If the upper strength is excessive, wood is removed;
if the lower strength is insufficient, sinew is added.
When the upper and lower strengths are balanced—
equal in firmness and weakness—
only then does the bow serve its purpose.
The principles of governance must align thus.
Cultivating the Dao and attaining authenticity
should also follow this.

*"High"* and *"low"* refer to *"noble"* and *"base,"*
*"excessive"* and *"deficient"* refer to *"wealthy"* and *"poor."*
Some say that when the bow is slack,
the two ends curve outward, and the grip is convex and high.
When drawn, the two ends curve inward, and the grip bulges outward.
If *"high"* and *"low"* are thus,
it is like exceeding or falling short—
why? When slack, the face is high;
when drawn, the back is high—
yet it is never truly level,
nor is it enduring.
Thus, it does not accord with Heaven’s Way.

Six sentences, two meanings.

Heaven’s Way is to diminish the excessive and supplement the deficient.
Human conduct is otherwise:
they diminish the deficient to serve the excessive.
Natural principle is empty and without possession—
when there is excess, it is diminished;
it seems as if it has sentiment,
yet fate and necessity compel it—
no one knows why.
The sage takes this as truth,
using it as a clear warning.
If a person can diminish their own excess
to supplement others’ deficiencies,
they align with Heaven’s Way.
If they diminish others’ deficiencies
to serve their own excess,
they follow human conduct.
The distance between these two paths—
one corrupt, one virtuous—
is vast.

Three sentences, three meanings.

Who can have excess to bestow upon the world?
Only the Daoist.
Who can diminish their own excess
to supplement those in want?
None but the benevolent and virtuous.
Only the sagely and virtuous can achieve this.

Four sentences, four meanings.

Thus, the sage acts without relying on it,
achieves success without dwelling on it,
and does not desire to be seen as virtuous.
*"Demonstrate"* means *"to be seen."*
*"Virtuous"* means *"able."*
The sage diminishes the excessive—
previously encouraging self-abnegation to aid others,
fearing they might rely on their deeds,
thus citing the sage’s model:
though they open the way and guide with virtue,
they do not claim merit.
High-minded and accomplished individuals
despise the reputation of virtue
for two reasons:
first, relying on virtue and boasting of ability
is unworthy of the Dao;
second, fame brings gain,
fostering deceit and greed—
taking from those without benefit,
a sin Heaven punishes.

**Chapter Forty-One of the World’s Nature**
Previously, it was shown that Heaven’s Way balances excess and deficiency;
now, it is shown that water’s gentle and weak nature
attacks the strong from below.

**Chapter Forty-Two of the Great Harmony**
Previously, it was shown that the Way’s transformation and application lie in gentle and weak endurance of defamation to become a ruler—
all these are in accordance with the Dao.
True words are like their opposites.

**Chapter Forty-Three of the Small Realm**
Previously, it was shown that goodness aligns with the Dao and that people harbor no grudges.
Now, it is shown that the ruler and ministers unite in harmony,
with no need for action above or below.

*"Gentle"* is not *"rigid,"* and *"virtuous"* is secondary to three distinctions:
first, gentle overcoming strength is effortless in application;
second, principles and affairs are clear, yet people fail to act accordingly;
third, tolerating defamation brings blessings, yet the foolish do not believe.

**Five Sentences, One Meaning:**
Among all things in the world, none are as gentle and weak as water.
Within all things, the most gentle and weak are none other than water.
This illustrates water’s essence,
so that those who follow the Dao may take it as their model.
Yet in overcoming strength and rigidity,
nothing can surpass it—
its power is unchanging.
Strength and rigidity are like mountains and stones.
Water’s use: it erodes stone, topples mountains,
while other things cannot compare.
In essence, it bears no burden;
in application, it achieves great results.
Essence and application both excel—
in things, its power is unchanging;
this illustrates its application.
In humans, strength and rigidity are afflictions;
gentle and weak are the Dao-heart.
To overcome afflictions,
only the Dao-heart can do so—
no other thing can replace it.

**Four Sentences, Two Meanings:**
Thus, gentle overcomes rigid,
weak overcomes strong—
yet none in the world can know or act upon this.
Rigid refers to afflictions,
which are extinguished by the Dao-heart,
so the heart prevails.
Human arrogance and obstinacy
are subdued by gentle and weak conduct,
so strength is inferior.
All this is verifiable by sight—
yet those who cannot know are foolish.
Or those who know but cannot act—
they lack faith in the Dao.

**Six Sentences, Three Meanings:**
Hence, the sage says:
*"To bear a nation’s defamation,
this is called the sovereign of the land and grain."*
*"To bear a nation’s ill fortune,
this is called the ruler of all under Heaven."*
The Old Master cites ancient sage laws
to exhort the present:
defamation refers to slanderous words and calumny,
ill fortune refers to unjust suffering—
then all directions have faults,
while the blame rests solely on me.
To be gentle and weak below,
with a mind set on humility,
yet able to endure defamation,
one attains the rank of a public duke,
becoming the sovereign of the land and grain.
To bear ill fortune,
one’s virtue is even greater—
thus one becomes an emperor and sovereign ruler.
All under Heaven reveres the wind of virtue;
this is the flow of the sage’s Way.
With a heart as vast as a valley,
nearby, one becomes a transformative sage for humans and Heaven;
farther, one becomes the true sovereign of the law.

True words appear as their opposites.
Earlier, it was said that gentle and weak overcoming strength,
enduring defamation to become a ruler—
all these are in accordance with the Dao.
True words are sincere and not false,
yet to the common masses they seem contrary to convention.

---

**Chapter Forty-Two of the Great Harmony**
Previously, it was shown that the Way’s transformation and application lie in gentle and weak endurance of defamation to become a ruler—
all these are in accordance with the Dao.
Now, it is shown that the ruler’s virtue lies in non-action,
not provoking grudges.

**Three Sentences, One Meaning:**
To reconcile great grudges,
there must still be lingering grudges—
how can this be considered good?
*"Reconcile"* means *"to pacify and settle."*
Great grudges are those where one has been killed or injured.
When clothing and food are sufficient and rites and propriety are known,
people still harbor grudges—
this is truly insufficient.
Insufficiency leads to theft, plunder, killing, and injury;
grudges follow in succession.
With resentment and shame unresolved,
one must seek revenge,
swearing to kill to satisfy one’s heart.
Even if one sweetly speaks and acts with good intentions,
temporarily achieving reconciliation,
the grudge remains unfulfilled,
and the heart still harbors resentment.
Though this grudge may subside,
another will arise.
The world is vast,
and grudges and enmities are boundless.
To make those skilled in persuasion
travel from house to house,
using this method to reconcile grudges—
how can this be considered good?
If one achieves great harmony under Heaven,
then there are no grudges to reconcile—
this is true goodness.
Yet only the enlightened ruler’s virtue
can bring this about.
Those who cultivate themselves
wish to sever the cycle of birth and death,
freeing themselves from past grudges and afflictions.
Those newly tainted
must settle their minds in non-action,
conduct their bodies in non-doing—
then they attain the root of grudges permanently severed,
and no further grudges arise.
Using this to reconcile grudges,
one can truly be called good.

**Five Sentences, Two Meanings:**
Thus, the sage holds the left token
and does not blame others.
The token symbolizes *"trust."*
In ancient times, before writing existed,
people carved wooden tokens for agreements.
Male and female tokens fit together—
the left (male) token was held by the lord,
the right (female) token by the subject,
used for governance and transformation.
If their laws are just,
then all under Heaven will be as one—
trusting each other,
scales and measures will not be needed,
and love and respect will be equal.
The strong will not oppress the weak,
the noble will not bully the humble—
then how can grudges arise?
Hence, the enlightened ruler above
must observe the customs of the people.
If there are disputes and conflicts,
investigate their origins—
if they stem from above,
abolish the token decrees.
If the fault lies with oneself,
one does not blame others.
This is speaking of those who harbor great grudges.
If one cultivates oneself through practice,
nourishing life with the Dao,
preserving nature through non-action,
and others hold grudges against me,
I only blame myself—
not daring to blame Heaven, people, or gods and spirits.
Thus, the virtuous hold the token,
while the unvirtuous lose it.
*"Lose"* means *"to fail."* The virtuous ruler,
seeing others’ faults,
only reflects on himself—
*"My laws are not appropriate,"*
and does not punish or blame others.
The unvirtueful ruler
only knows to spy on others’ mistakes,
unaware that others’ faults originate from himself—
thus he punishes and blames others,
while not blaming himself.

**Two Sentences, Three Meanings:**
The Way of Heaven has no favorites,
always aligning with the virtuous.
*"Heaven"* means *"the natural order."*
*"No favorites"* means *"equality."*
The virtuous include all—
rulers, subjects, and the common folk.
If one can take responsibility for their own faults,
be humble and detached in non-action,
then the natural order will align with them—
though they hold the left token,
their agreements will be without grudges.
Better still is one who walks the great Dao—
no tokens are needed, yet grudges do not arise.
Even spirits and gods remain hidden;
how much more so among human relations?

---

**Chapter Forty-Three of the Small Realm**
Previously, it was shown that goodness aligns with the Dao,
and that people harbor no grudges.
Now, it is shown that the ruler and ministers unite,
with no need for action above or below.

**Three Sentences, One Meaning:**
Rulers and ministers, if they follow the Dao,
will ensure safety for the people.
People are content in their dwellings,
knowing the joy of the Dao,
content with sufficiency.
Rulers and ministers forget each other,
practicing the Dao—
no need for visits or exchanges.

**Six Sentences, One Meaning:**

The Small Realm, few in its people,
commands them to possess tenfold or hundredfold implements yet not employ them.
Its lands are narrow, hence called the Small Realm;
Its commoners and scholars are few, hence called few in its people.
This is because one can walk the Dao—
households are rich, the people content.
*Tenfold* and *hundredfold* refer to the great numbers of household goods;
all things are fully provided, yet simplicity saves effort—
thus they are not used.
*Moderation* is the Dao of the realm,
and the people’s six senses—
to speak of fewness and smallness is humility.

When it speaks of *tenfold* and *hundredfold implements*,
it means arts and crafts—
arts and crafts can be employed, hence called *implements*.
To say *not employed* is to say they are forgotten in emptiness.

Let the people hold death as weighty,
yet not flee to distant lands.
When the ruler walks the Dao,
the people rejoice in life yet dread death—
death is hard to bear, hence they do not lightly enter perilous ground.
Their bodies are self-sufficient,
free from laborious hoarding—
thus they do not wander far or scheme for external gains.
If the heart-mind’s king walks the Dao,
the senses and consciousness are tranquil and harmonious,
with no cravings, no demands—
evil is dispelled, burdens vanish,
and even minor offenses in life are not lightly committed,
how much more so death?
Though chariots and boats exist,
they find no use for them.
Though armor and weapons are kept,
they find no need to display them.

「Chariots and boats rank first among myriad implements.
In grand discourse, only the four matters are mentioned.
Boats traverse the waters, carriages bear the land—
when the Dao suffices for the body,
and wealth suffices for the home,
there is no need for further seeking,
so they are not employed.

*Armour* refers to protective gear,
to be worn on the body and head,
to repel external foes.
*Weapons* are spears and blades,
held in hand to strike and slash.
Yet the finest of weapons are called *armour*.
In cultivating the self, the ancient heart-mind was fierce and bold as weapons,
but now it is gentle and yielding, compliant and serene as water—
seeking only to benefit others,
not desiring to harm.
Their outward forms may exist,
but their application is none,
so though present, they are not displayed.

Let the people return to the governance of knotted cords.
*Return* means to revert to origins.
*Knotted cords* symbolize the pure politics of antiquity.
In terms of time, the ancient was pure while the present is corrupt.
In terms of the heart, the Dao-heart is pure while the vulgar heart is corrupt.
At their inception, when the heart-mind’s desires first sprout,
it shifts from purity to corruption.
When the heart-mind discards greed and craving,
it shifts from corruption back to purity.
Thus, the corruption or purity of time follows the heart-mind’s transformation,
like the Four Husbands’ pure simplicity—
it depends solely on one’s own cultivation,
not on altering the world’s customs.
If one wishes to restore the world to purity,
to match the age of antiquity,
it must await a ruler who walks the Dao.

The next four sentences are the second category:
Let their food be savoury,
their clothing be fine,
their dwellings be secure,
and their customs be joyous.
With no cravings for worldly tastes,
plain food is naturally sweet.
With only modest desires,
rough garments are deemed splendid.
When their abode is pleasing—
even a thatched hut suffices for comfort—
and they take delight in the Dao’s effortless Way,
what need have they for changing customs?

The following four sentences are the third category:
Neighbouring lands are visible,
and the sounds of roosters and dogs are heard between them,
yet the people do not visit one another until old age.
*Neighbouring lands* are small nations close at hand,
so that what the eye can see includes morning roosters and nighttime dogs,
making it clear they are not distant.
From childhood to old age,
spanning long years,
they do not come and go—
because each suffices in their own right.
When the Dao suffices, there is no need for consultation,
when wealth suffices, there is no need for borrowing or lending,
and mutual sufficiency leads to forgetting one another,
so they do not visit.

The next six sentences are the fourth category:
*True words are not ornate; ornate words are not true.*
*True words* refer to the teachings of the Dao.
The *Scriptures*’ teachings should be spoken directly,
plain in language yet profound in meaning,
without embellishment or allure,
without concealment or distortion—
easy to know, easy to practice.
This is the *direct Scripture*.
Crafty, ornate speech,
adorned with flowery words,
hollowly proclaiming blessings and calamities,
to seduce the greedy and mislead the foolish—
though it may appeal to the shallow,
it further confuses the profound.
Such is superficial without substance,
not the true *Scripture*.
With these two distinctions—*true* and *ornate*—
all teachings of the Dao can be judged for authenticity or falsity.

*Good persons do not argue; arguers are not good.*
Knowledge of words lies in the heart,
goodness of words lies in practice—
when the heart knows and the body acts,
there is no need to argue for oneself.
The true good person rejects what others deem wrong.
If one argues only for oneself,
condemning others while flattering the crowd,
using eloquence to bend others,
and many words to subdue things—
this is not the good person.
These six sentences universally discuss the merits and faults of scholars,
the authenticity or falsity of teachings,
and seek the most refined—
the tortoise-shell mirror lies here.
Fortunate are those who meet with like-minded hearts,
to leave behind a clear reflection for future generations.

*The wise are not versed in many things; versed ones are not wise.*
Those who truly grasp the Dao
know the Dao is not conveyed through words,
so they do not rely on excessive speech.
To amass knowledge and claim wisdom
is to drown in superficiality,
to further bewilder the heart-mind—
thus, they are said to be *unwise*.
This is *wisdom*, so they are not *versed*.
To be *versed*, they are *unwise*.
The Sage does not hoard.
*Hoard* means to store and accumulate.
There are two meanings of *hoard*:
one is to accumulate virtue,
the other is not to accumulate.

To cultivate virtue and establish merit,
layer upon layer, as in *repeatedly accumulating virtue*.
Not to accumulate means to bestow virtue upon the foolish,
to give wealth to the poor—
when the opportunity arises, to teach without hesitation,
to spare nothing of oneself.
To accumulate speech in self-cultivation,
but not to accumulate speech for others’ benefit.
Having served the people,
one’s own virtue grows ever more abundant.
*Having* means to exhaust,
*serve* means to teach and guide,
*abundant* means to increase.
The Sage’s virtue is boundless,
without stinginess or reluctance—
exhausted in teaching others,
guiding them through practice,
and benefiting them according to their capacity.
The recipients grow enriched,
and the Sage’s virtue renews itself daily—
thus it is said to *increase*.
Having given to the people,
one’s own virtue becomes even greater.
Wealth is given to the poor,
and one’s own abundance grows richer—
the Dao has no outward form,
so subtle and profound it can only be grasped by the heart-mind’s silent communion,
not by physical holding or seizing—
thus it is called *serve*.
Wealth is tangible and measurable,
so it is called *give*.

The Way of Heaven,
benefits yet does not harm.
The *Way of Heaven* is the Way of Nature.
In speaking of its essence,
it is empty, yet all-pervading—
divine and elusive.
In speaking of its function,
it gives rise to all things,
and brings all things to fruition.»

This is the Way of universal benefit,
yet never causing loss.
The Sage’s Dao is to act without striving.
The Sage’s teaching is in subtle words,
seeking only to preserve the empty self—
acting yet not claiming credit,
always attributing merit to others.
If one does not take, how can one contend?
If one benefits, how can one compete?
Merit and benefit without contention—
the ultimate of self-forgetting,
the marvelous harmony with the Dao,
the peak of virtue.

The heart and mouth are the tools of contention.
The Dao of Heaven and the Sage’s virtue
are indistinct and profound in unity.
All things arise and reach fulfillment
through the interplay of Heaven and Sagehood—
without Heaven, nothing is born;
without the Sage, nothing is perfected.
Hence, the Dao of Heaven speaks without harm,
while the Sage’s words avoid contention.
Yet though their names differ,
their essence is one:
Heaven’s speech causes no harm,
the Sage’s words provoke no strife.
If spoken of as indistinct unity,
then Heaven’s Dao has no contention,
and the Sage’s Way causes no harm—
yet they are distinguished by their teachings,
thus bearing two names.

To abandon teachings and return to principle,
to rest in the silent unity of Heaven and Sagehood—
the root of Heaven and Sagehood is already "none."
The progression of contention and harm
has no difference at all.
A single wondrous *Sutra*,
its meaning concludes here.
Those who establish and then discard
do so to forget words and grasp the Dao.

Thus, this chapter encapsulates the five thousand profound truths,
and if its intent is understood,
what words remain unclear?

The Dao pervades all existence—
yet if one seeks it within existence,
one will never find it.
Beyond existence, it is nonexistent.
If one seeks it apart from existence,
there is no method to attain it.
The faithful know that the Dao is without absence,
yet wherever it is present, it is without form.
To truly seek the Dao,
one must disregard all distinctions of place and direction.

Many household interpretations explain it through worldly affairs,
attaching words to the body—
this is the meaning of "node" (节).
Alchemical refinement of the highest medicines—
the origin of the *Dan Jing*.
Distant talk of emptiness—
the style of Wang Bi.
Illustrating principle through affairs—
the manner of Sun Login.
Preserving all phenomena—
the tradition of Yin-Yang.
Peaceful dwelling yet abandoning restraint—
the metaphor of Han Fei.
Drowning the mind to extinguish form—
the expansive method of Yan Zun.
Adding words to gain enlightenment—
the core of Confucian learning.

The vulgar cling to existence,
failing to grasp the Dao’s absolute wisdom;
The monks adhere to emptiness,
deriding Li Ji’s teachings as mere household matters.
This is because Confucius lacked the pursuit of true essence,
and the Buddha had no skill in elucidating the Dao—
both merely exhausted their vitality to earn later fame,
and drained their precious resources to seek transient fortune.

Thus, they sit in three corners and insist on their own correctness,
or monopolize a single tune and speak in riddles,
prolonging their confusion of the Great Dao,
until death they remain perplexed—
all are caught in contention over principle,
digging into corners to debate emptiness,
splitting the profound and true,
and their minds lean ever so slightly from the Dao.

This *Sutra*’s vast source is deep and broad,
its applications ranging from refined to coarse—
like a great bird soaring to the heavens,
seen from afar as a swallow, up close as a crane,
northerners behold it as southern,
southerners perceive it as northern.
Since minds differ,
their interpretations vary.
Now, we strive to transcend material adornments,
to focus on our own true essence.
The Dao is obtained through the body,
yet to attain it, one must demolish form and sit in forgetfulness,
pursuing it with constancy,
gradually feeling its profound benefits.

Thus, we know that the medicine which does not cause calloused hands
is but a floating wisp of cotton,
a mere shred of earthly deception—
how strange and false!

*The True Classic of Dao and Virtue*—
Exhaustive Exegesis, Volume Six concludes.
