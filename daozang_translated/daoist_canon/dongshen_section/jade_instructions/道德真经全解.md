**Preface to *The Complete Exegesis of the Dao De Jing***

The Five-Thousand-Character *Mixed Primordial* [text], with commentaries circulating in the world, are numerous. Yet they all dissect chapter by chapter, sentence by sentence, failing to weave a coherent whole—mere clever conjectures and fabricated interpretations, not the fruit of true enlightenment. Thus, the profound words and hidden meanings remain obscured, stifled and unexpressed. Readers, bewildered by their multiplicity, know not where to turn.

Then, a person from Huà returned to Zhēnzhēn after wandering in Huá, presenting *The Complete Exegesis of the Dao De* to me—its author unknown. Upon careful contemplation, my understanding opened like a floodgate; long-standing doubts dissolved like ice in spring. Inner and outer harmonized, the meaning flowed like strung pearls, transcending ordinary thought by tenfold measures—*#1*—far beyond the grasp of worldly scholarship.

Indeed, the lofty Immortals and Perfected Ones, moved by pity for the ignorant masses, unveiled the deepest mysteries. As the *Dao* is hidden and nameless, yet its benevolent transmission flourishes—such is their work.

Having received this text, I could not bear to hoard it alone. Thus, I urged my friends Shí Jīn and others, gathered the devoted, commissioned artisans to engrave the plates, and spread its teachings far and wide.

In the *Zhènglòng* era, the fourth year, when the year *Dānruò* began in the first month, Shí Yōng of the Huà Community, in leisurely repose, wrote this preface.

*#1* **陪 (péi):** Likely a corruption; should read **"倍" (bèi, "tenfold").**

*Exegesis by Shí Yōng of the Huà Community, in Leisurely Repose*

**Chapter One: "The Dao That Can Be Spoken Of"**

The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao;
The name that can be named is not the eternal Name.

The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;
The named is the mother of all things.

Ever without desire, one observes its subtlety;
Ever with desire, one observes its peril.

These two, though issuing from the same source, bear different names—
Yet both are called the Mysterious.
The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious—
The gateway through which all subtleties emerge.

The Dao is the void, the natural and spontaneous.
Because it is natural, it endures;
If forced, it perishes.

To call it the Dao is but to impose a name—
How can this be its true nature?

Yet if it can be named, then there exists what cannot be named—
This is the *you* (酉).

Heaven can be Heaven but cannot be Earth;
Earth can be Earth but cannot be Heaven.
Above and below differ in position;
Square and round differ in form.
Thus, departing from the origin, Heaven and Earth arise—
This is the Dao that can be spoken of, yet not the eternal Dao.

Dispersed, it becomes rivers and seas;
Condensed, it becomes mountains and peaks.
Birds and beasts fly and walk;
Grasses and trees blossom and bear fruit.
Thus, descending from the origin and flowing to the end,
All things are born—
This is the name that can be named, yet not the eternal Name.

The eternal Dao is the undifferentiated unity of yin and yang,
Before their separation, when they were one.
From this oneness arises the One yet unformed—
No name can be given to it,
Thus it is nameless, the beginning of Heaven and Earth.

The eternal Name is when yin and yang divide,
And Heaven and Earth emerge.
Only then do all things arise,
Thus it is named, the mother of all things.

Only the Dao of Heaven is called the eternal "without":
To embody Heaven’s Dao is to be without desire and without action;
To embody Earth’s Dao is to be without movement and ever still.

To harmonize Heaven and Earth’s Dao with humanity,
One attains the pure and harmonious *qi* to become perfect.
The greatest perfection is ineffable and inexpressible—
Yet it governs the world and brings peace to the people,
As does the Dao of Heaven and Earth.

Thus, for those above, without desire,
The people become pure and tranquil, transformed.
To cultivate what is beautiful as beautiful—
Its fullness cannot be exhausted.

This Dao is pure and uncarved,
Thus the Dao that can be spoken of cannot truly be spoken—
Yet it aligns with the eternal Dao.

Ever without desire, one observes its subtlety:
Because one remains ever still and unmoving,
The form returns to the center, the spirit undispersed—
Thus the eternal Dao reveals its subtlety.

The subtlety is motionless and ever tranquil;
Great transformation unfolds in the world,
As the body, unspoiled, finds joy—
Preserving the True One, its subtlety is nameless.

As for a land with a ruler,
If the ruler desires nothing,
The people desire nothing—
Thus arises the pure and thick virtue, untainted.
Hence, ever without desire, one observes its subtlety.

If one embodies Earth’s Dao and returns to the origin,
Then the ever-present becomes visible—
Desire is observed to perceive its peril.

These two—Heaven and Earth’s Dao—
Both arise from the One,
Thus they are said to issue from the same source yet bear different names.
Though issuing from the same source, they are both called the Mysterious.

The Mysterious contains red and black:
*Qián* is red, *Kūn* is black,
Both hidden within the *Huáng* (皇).
This is the *Huáng Tiān*, the *Huáng Dì*.

The Dao of Heaven and Earth
Gathers *qi* at the Upper Primordial—
Thus the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious.
The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious is called the Great *Fán* (梵).

The Heaven within Heaven,
Descending to govern the human body’s *ní wán* (泥丸) and *jiàng gōng* (绛宫),
Regulating the Five *Qi* and blending the Hundred Spirits,
Through which all subtleties enter and exit—
Thus it is called the gateway of all subtleties.

If one can cultivate purity, stillness, and embrace the One,
Preserving and guarding the *Xuándū* (玄都),
Then one attains the eternal Dao.

**Chapter Two: "When All Under Heaven Know"**

When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,
Then ugliness arises;
When all know goodness as goodness,
Then wickedness arises.

Thus, being and non-being give rise to each other,
Difficulty and ease define each other,
Long and short give form to each other,
High and low complement each other,
Sounds harmonize with each other,
Before and after follow each other.

Therefore, the Sage acts without action,
Teaches without speech.
All things arise without resistance,
Are born without possession,
Act without reliance,
And when the deed is done, takes no credit.
Because he does not take credit,
His virtue does not depart.

Beauty and goodness are the natural Dao of Heaven and Earth—
All under Heaven knows them.
Yet when beauty is recognized as beauty,
Then ugliness arises.
When goodness is recognized as goodness,
Then wickedness arises—
Why is this?

Heaven and Earth give birth to the forms of things,
Yet these forms are never without beauty.
Because things have birth, death, and decay—
Like the divine and the putrid, the return and transformation—
Then what was once beautiful becomes loathsome.

Heaven and Earth give birth to the spirit of humanity,
Yet this spirit is never without goodness.
Because humanity possesses external wisdom—
Like reconciling great grudges, yet leaving lingering resentment—
Then goodness splits into wickedness.

Once beauty and goodness are distinguished,
They no longer align with the Dao of non-action.
Thus, one and the other transform each other,
Meeting only to invert—
Hence the following text illustrates this.

Being and non-being give rise to each other
Because the eternal Dao is formless—
There is the logic of being and non-being generating each other,
Thus there are difficult and easy matters to define.

Long and short give form to each other
Because Earth’s Dao has no corners—
There are measures of long and short to define,
Thus there are inclinations of high and low.

Sounds harmonize with each other
Because Heaven’s Dao is subtle in sound—
There are musical tones to harmonize,
Thus there are responses of before and after.

Only the Sage understands the transformations of beauty and ugliness,
The burdens of goodness and wickedness—
Thus he embodies the natural Dao of Heaven and Earth,
Acting without action,
Teaching without speech.

Only by teaching without speech
Do all things arise without resistance.
Thus, holding the left tablet but not demanding compliance from others—
Who then would be wicked?

This is called knowing the good throughout the heavens.
Only by dwelling in non-action
Does one give birth yet not possess,
Act yet not rely upon,
Complete deeds yet not claim them.
Thus, one entrusts things to their natural unfolding,
Without harboring private intentions—
Who then would be blameworthy?

This is called knowing beauty throughout the heavens.
Because one acts without resistance,
One allows things to arise spontaneously—
Though born yet not possessed,
Though acting yet not relied upon,
Though having merit yet not dwelling upon it.

Born yet not possessed—this is the Earth’s Dao.
Acting yet not relying—this is Heaven’s Dao.
Completing deeds yet not claiming them—this is the Constant Dao.
Embodying these three,
Thus within oneself there is no dwelling,
Things cannot displace it—
What then could depart?

Hence it is said:
Only by not dwelling does one not depart.

**Chapter Three: Not Honoring the Worthy**
Not honoring the worthy, so the people do not contend;
Not valuing rare treasures, so the people do not steal;
Not displaying what is desirable, so the heart does not stray.
Thus the Sage’s governance:
Empties the mind, fills the belly,
Weakens the will, strengthens the bones.
Ever keeps the people without knowledge, without desire,
So even the wise dare not act.

Acting in non-action,
Then nothing remains untended.

The worthy have intelligence—
Honor them, and the people contend.
Merchants have desires—
Value their goods, and thieves multiply.
The worthy are names,
Merchants are profits—
Nothing more desirable to people than names and profits.
Since neither is honored nor valued,
This is called not displaying what is desirable.

Not displaying what is desirable,
Then the spirit guards the form—
How could the heart then be disordered?

Thus the Sage does not honor the worthy,
Embodying Heaven’s lack of knowledge;
Does not value goods,
Following Earth’s lack of desire.
Embodying Heaven, the mind is emptied,
Following Earth, the belly is filled—
The mind’s emptiness weakens the will,
The belly’s fullness strengthens the bones.
Thus ever keeping the people without knowledge, without desire,
Even great worthies, though wise,
Are subdued by the Sage and dare not act in contrivance.

This is called: Acting in non-action, then nothing remains untended.

**Chapter Four: The Dao’s Pervasiveness**
The Dao is pervading yet used without excess,
Sometimes not full—
Deep, like the origin of all things.
Blunting its sharpness,
Untangling its complications,
Dulling its brilliance,
Aligning with the dust—
Serene, as if it exists.

I do not know whose child it is,
Before the Imperial Sovereign.

The Dao in Heaven,
Using non-action,
Hence it is called the pervading Dao.
Pervading—
Empty yet containing all things.
Yet great fullness is like emptiness,
Because it can contain all things,
Thus it is not full yet overflows.

The Dao in Earth,
With stillness as its essence,
Hence it is called deep.
Deep—
Profound yet unfathomable.
Yet all things depend upon it,
Yet do not know their source,
Thus it seems like the origin.

If one embodies Heaven’s Dao,
Pervading, empty, tranquil—
Blunting sharpness;
Embodying Earth’s Dao,
Deep, still, quiescent—
Untangling complications.
Blunting sharpness—
Its upper reaches harmonize light without dazzling—
Is this not the Dao in Heaven?
Untangling complications—
Its lower reaches aligns with dust without filth—
Is this not the Dao in Earth?

The Dao in Heaven and Earth,
Pervading, empty, deep—
Serene, indeed it exists.
Though called existing,
In Heaven it sometimes exists,
In Earth it seems to exist—
Hence it is called "seemingly existing."

From the primordial beginning of ages past,
Thus unknown whose child transformed into all heavens—
This is called before the Imperial Sovereign.

**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth’s Lack of Ren**
Heaven and Earth lack *ren*—
They treat all things as sacrificial straw dogs;
The Sage lacks *ren*—
He treats the people as sacrificial straw dogs.

Between Heaven and Earth,
Is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet not exhausted,
Moving yet ever producing.

Much speech leads to exhaustion,
Better to hold to the center.

Seven—
This is the human heart.
Lacking *ren*, it is ever without attachment.
Only ever without attachment,
Thus though there is the reality of love and benefit,
There is no burden of love and benefit—
This is why Heaven, Earth, and the Sage treat all things and the people as sacrificial straw dogs.

Binding straw to make a dog,
For use in sacrifices—
When appropriate, it is used,
Thus there is the reality of love and benefit;
When over, it is discarded,
Thus there is no burden of love and benefit.

Between Heaven and Earth, like a valley—
Also because of its lack of attachment and central emptiness,
Thus it is like a bellows.
The bellows is empty yet can receive,
Receiving yet can respond,
Emerging from lack of attachment,
Thus it does not exhaust,
Moving yet ever producing.

If those who act without response,
Emerging from attachment,
Then much speech yet cannot avoid burden—
Thus they exhaust.
If one embodies Heaven and Earth’s lack of attachment,
Guarding the pervading, empty, tranquil Dao,
Naturally attaining the spirit,
Then responding only after stimulation—
What exhaustion could there be?

**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit’s Immortality**
The Valley Spirit does not die—
This is called the Mysterious Female.
The Mysterious Female’s gate—
This is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
Endless, as if it exists,
Using it is effortless.

The world’s people know only mountain and marsh valleys,
Yet do not know what is called the Valley of the World—
Heaven and Earth are this.

Heaven and Earth lack attachment yet are centrally empty,
Bearing the form of a valley.
Heaven and Earth can generate and transform,
Called the Ultimate Spirit.
Only the Spirit,
Responding and thus communicating,
Also like the valley’s emptiness in responding—
Thus it is called the Valley Spirit.

Yet the generator does not generate itself,
The transformer does not transform itself—
Thus it endures, hence the Valley Spirit does not die.

Heaven, though generating,
Its power to generate things is the Mysterious.
Earth, though transforming,
Its power to transform things is the Female.
Thus it is called the Mysterious Female.

The Mysterious Female—
Is it not yin and yang?
Before yin and yang harmonize and do not yet divide,
Who then is Heaven and Earth?
Only when yin and yang separate do Heaven and Earth emerge,
Thus Heaven and Earth enter and exit through this—
Hence it is called the gate of the Mysterious Female,
This is called the root of Heaven and Earth.

The root of Heaven and Earth—
Before Heaven and Earth exist,
It has ever been preserved since antiquity,
Hence it is called *Mianmian* [enduring like fine silk] as if it exists.

If such is the case—
Responding only after being moved,
Never acting before things,
How could there be any laboriousness?

Hence it is called *Use it not with effort*.

The Dao in Heaven and Earth is thus:
Humans, in appearance resembling Heaven and Earth,
Also have the *Nine Cauldrons* [泥九] to respond to it.

The *Nine Cauldrons*—
These are the Valley Spirit within me,
Called the *Kunlun Mountains* [昆仑之山].
Within lies the *square-inch elixir field* [丹田], connected to the *seven orifices* [七窍],
Known as the *Heavenly Valley* [天谷],
Where the *Divine Man* [神人] resides.

The elixir field within is round, responding to Heaven,
The field without is square, responding to Earth—
Thus the meaning of the Mysterious Female.

Yet, the *Thirty-five Divisions* [三十五分],
Collecting the *Upper Original Qi* [上元],
This is called the *Heavenly Root* [天根].
If one can embody the Dao within oneself,
Then one attains eternal life, unending,
And aligns with Heaven and Earth.

**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth Enduring and Long-lasting**
Heaven and Earth endure and last,
The reason Heaven and Earth can endure and last—
Is that they do not generate themselves,
Hence they can attain eternal life.
Thus, the Sage allows his body to be last, yet it is first,
Rejects his body outwardly, yet it is preserved.
Is it not because they have no selfishness?
Hence they can fulfill their selfishness.

The Dao generates all things yet does not generate itself,
Heaven and Earth resemble the Dao,
Hence they can endure and last—
Enduring and lasting, then they endure and last forever.

Heaven and Earth have no selfishness,
Hence they have no selfishness—
The Sage embodies Heaven and Earth,
Hence he can fulfill his selfishness—
Fulfilling his selfishness, his body is first yet preserved.

*Allowing his body to be last*—
This means not contending with things.
*Rejecting his body outwardly*—
This means preserving his spirit.
This is called embodying Heaven and Earth’s lack of selfishness.

Heaven’s utmost selfishness,
Yet its use is most public—
Is this not its effect?

**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Good Resembles Water**
The supreme good resembles water,
Water benefits all things yet does not contend,
Dwelling where people revile—
Hence it is close to the Dao.

Its dwelling is good,
Its heart is deep,
Its giving is generous,
Its speech is trustworthy,
Its governance is clear,
Its deeds are skilled,
Its actions are timely.

Only because it does not contend,
Hence it has no blame.
Water’s nature—
If not held, then clear,
If not stirred, then calm,
If stagnant and blocked, unable to flow,
It also cannot be clear—
This reflects Heaven’s virtue,
Hence the supreme good resembles water.

Water benefits all things,
Close to Heaven and Earth’s Dao,
Yet all these are actions fitting their measure,
Hence it is called *actions are timely*.
Actions fitting their measure—
How could there be any contention?
This is why it has no blame.

**Chapter Nine: Holding Yet Filling It**
Holding yet filling it,
Not as good as letting it be;
Pushing yet sharpening it,
Cannot long endure.

Gold and jade fill the hall,
Yet none can guard them;
Rich and noble yet arrogant,
They bring ruin upon themselves.

When achievement is complete,
And name is established,
Retire in body—
This is Heaven’s Way.

Filling cannot last,
Better not to desire filling—
Why must one hold it?

Advancing swiftly, retreating quickly,
Better to blunt its sharpness—
Why must one push it?

Gold and jade fill the hall,
Yet none can guard them—
This is because they are already full.
Rich and noble yet arrogant,
They bring ruin upon themselves—
This is because they are already sharp.

This is the loss of the *Way of Kindness and Modesty* [慈俭之道],
Hence there are the faults of excess and sharpness.

Excess is achievement complete,
Sharpness is name established.
Once achievement is complete and name is established,
Then there is the principle of retiring in body—
This is the movement of yin and yang’s advancing, retreating, excess, and deficiency.

If one can guard the *Way of Kindness and Modesty*,
Then abandon achievement and name,
Return to the common people—
How could there be excess or sharpness?

**Chapter Ten: Nurturing the Vital Essence and Spirit**
Nurturing the vital essence and spirit, embracing unity,
Can one avoid separation?
Focusing the qi to attain softness,
Can one be like an infant?
Cleansing and purifying the Mysterious Vision,
Can one avoid blemish?
Loving the people and governing the state,
Can one act without doing?

Heaven’s gate opens and closes,
Can one be female?
Bright and clear, reaching everywhere,
Can one be without knowing?

Nurturing and storing life,
Generating yet not possessing,
Doing yet not relying,
Long-lasting yet not slaughtering—
This is called the *Mysterious Virtue* [玄德].

The body—
The spirit’s chariot,
The vital essence’s vehicle.

The soul ascends and moves,
The vital essence follows, entering and exiting—
Thus the spirit’s threads extend outward,
And governance is directed toward action,
Hence the three souls are restless,
And the vital essence is ever declining.

Only the Sage hides the spirit within,
Thus nurturing and storing it—
The vital essence does not follow the soul in reckless movement outward.

Thus, it can be the *Essentials of Vitality and Longevity* [卫生之经],
Hence it is called *Nurturing the Vital Essence and Spirit*.

The *Essentials of Vitality and Longevity*—
Have no other secrets,
Yet do not depart from the three: *Essence* [精], *Qi* [气], *Spirit* [神].

Those who can embrace unity,
Their essence does not tremble;
Those who are like infants,
Their qi does not rage;
Those who cleanse and purify thought,
Their spirit is preserved—
This is called embodying Heaven and Earth’s Dao.

Not only this—
Those who embody Heaven’s Dao,
Can act without doing,
Loving the people and governing the state,
Desiring that they act without doing.

Those who can act without doing in loving the people and governing the state,
Then cleansing and purifying the Mysterious Vision—
I act without doing,
Yet the people transform themselves.

Those who embody Earth’s Dao,
Can be female,
Heaven’s gate opening and closing—
Desiring that they be female.

Those who can be female in the opening and closing of Heaven’s gate,
Then focus the qi to attain softness—
Day and night without sleep,
Thus attaining the truth.

Those who embody the *Constant Dao* [常道],
Can be without knowing,
Bright and clear, reaching everywhere—
Desiring that they be without knowing.

Those who can be without knowing in being bright and clear,
Then gather vision and return hearing—
Embrace unity as a model for all under Heaven.

If such is the case,
Then the essence is complete and unspent,
The qi harmonious and unrestrained,
The spirit clear and unblemished—
Then virtue and Dao unite as one,
Mingling indistinctly, in great harmony with the boundless void.

That which gives life is the Dao.
That which nurtures is virtue.
The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is called *generation*—
This virtue, when spoken of in terms of the whole of Heaven and Earth,
Is none other than the Dao itself.

Heaven is the Mysterious,
Earth is the Field—
Thus, nurturing follows them.
Earth’s Dao generates yet does not generate itself,
So it generates yet does not possess.
Heaven’s Dao acts without doing,
So it acts yet does not rely.
The Constant Dao fulfills and sustains,
So it sustains yet does not govern.

These three correspond to the *Dantian* at the crown of the head—
This is the virtue of Heaven.

In Heaven, it is the Mysterious—
Thus, the Mysterious Virtue is none other than Heaven’s Virtue.
Heaven’s Virtue acts through non-action,
And those who cultivate the spirit likewise rely on the absence of contrivance—
How could this virtue not be Heaven’s Virtue?

**Thirty Spokes, Chapter Ten**
Thirty spokes converge at one hub;
It is the emptiness that gives the wheel its use.
Mold clay to make a vessel;
It is the emptiness that gives it utility.
Carve doors and windows to make a room;
It is the emptiness that gives it space.

Thus, what is present brings advantage,
But what is absent brings use.
That which is ridden is the wheel’s motion alone;
That which is fitting is the vessel’s proper function;
That which is dwelt in is the room’s stillness.

Movement is action,
Stillness is repose,
And proper use lies between the two—
Thus the Sage elucidates the Dao through this.

Observing these three,
All bear the symbol of external presence and internal absence—
Presence is substance,
Absence is void,
Absence uses presence for advantage,
Presence relies on absence for function.
Reflecting inward, one must resolve this within oneself.

Presence is form,
Absence is spirit—
Spirit generates form,
So form relies on spirit for function.
Form shapes spirit,
So spirit relies on form for substance.
Without form, spirit cannot manifest,
Without spirit, form cannot complete itself.
When form and spirit unite in harmony,
They mutually generate and fulfill—
Then the Dao is preserved.

Yet how is it that spirit often loves humanity,
While humanity does not love spirit,
Thus leading to early decline?

Therefore, the virtuous cultivate a tranquil heart and preserve the spirit,
Maintaining emptiness within.

**Five Colors, Chapter Twelve**
Five colors blind the eyes,
Five tones deafen the ears,
Five flavors dull the palate,
Galloping hunts drive the mind to madness.
Rare treasures entangle one’s conduct.

Thus the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes,
And discards the former to take the latter.

That which is unseen is called *tranquil*—the Constant Dao.
The world’s people cannot gather vision inward,
But let the five colors dazzle the eyes externally,
Thus losing the Dao of the Primordial Beginning—
Hence, they are blind.

That which is unheard is called *subtle*—Heaven’s Dao.
The world’s people cannot return hearing to stillness,
But let the five tones assail the ears externally,
Thus losing the Dao of the First Origin—
Hence, they are deaf.

That which cannot be grasped is called *refined*—Earth’s Dao.
The world’s people cannot nourish qi from the Great Harmony,
But let the five flavors dominate the mouth,
Thus losing the Dao of the Great Simplicity—
Hence, they are dulled.

These three—
Losing the inner guard of the inch-field,
And wandering the mind—
Thus it is said that galloping hunts drive the mind to madness.

Once externally attached to things,
And fixated on desires,
One becomes burdened in conduct—
Thus rare treasures entangle one’s steps.

Therefore, the Sage, without knowing, nurtures virtue within,
And though desires may appear,
He does not lose his nature externally—
Thus he fills the belly alone,
And does not indulge the eyes.

Why speak of the eyes alone among these three?
The nine orifices and three vital gates—
Their mechanism lies in the eyes.
Thus, discard the external allure of sight,
And take the inner substance of virtue.

**Honor and Humiliation, Chapter Thirteen**
Honor and humiliation are like a shock,
Treasure great calamity as one’s own body.

What is meant by *honor and humiliation*?
Honor is lowly—
To gain it is like a shock,
To lose it is like a shock—
This is called *honor and humiliation as a shock*.

What is meant by *treasuring great calamity as one’s own body*?
My great calamity arises because I have a body.
If I had no body, what calamity would I have?

Thus, to treasure the body for all under Heaven,
Is to say that one may entrust all under Heaven.
To love the body for all under Heaven,
Is to say that one may commit all under Heaven to it.

Honor and humiliation arise from engagement with affairs.
Once engaged with affairs,
The spirit cannot guard internally—
Thus, it is like a shock.

Treasure is virtue.
Everyone has virtue within themselves,
Yet some burden their own virtue—
This is because they have a body,
Thus great calamity is like the body itself.

Honor is being subject to others,
The way of being beneath others—
To have honor is to invite humiliation—
Thus, to gain it is to lose it.

If one clings to it with the mind, one fears losing it;
If one abandons it with the mind, one grieves its loss.
Unable to guard internally within things,
This is why it is like a shock.

*I* refers to the sovereign above all things,
The title of virtue’s summit.

My great calamity arises because I have a body,
And thus burden my virtue.

To have a body is to serve all under Heaven.
If one serves all under Heaven,
Then form burdens the mind,
And the mind burdens virtue,
Losing what commands all things—
Thus, no calamity is greater.

If one does not use all under Heaven as a burden,
Then one takes emptiness as the body,
And does not let the body become a burden—
This is the *body without a body*—
And what calamity could there be?

The common folk are confused by presence and absence,
And do not know the principle of the bodiless.
Thus, the following analogy is given.

Moreover, to treasure the body for all under Heaven,
Is to treasure what is entrusted to the body—
Thus, those who awaken to the Dao
May entrust all under Heaven—
What calamity could there be?

Again, to love the body for all under Heaven,
Is to entrust honor to the body—
Thus, those who attain the Dao
May commit all under Heaven to it—
What humiliation could there be?

Knowing that coming and going are not mine,
Not burdening the body with oneself,
Forgetting all things in heart and mind,
Not prideful of honor—
Thus the gentleman, when forced to govern all under Heaven,
Does so as if entrusting it—
This is called *not using all under Heaven as a burden*.

**Chapter Fourteen: The Formless Form**

What cannot be seen is called *Yī* (均),
What cannot be heard is called *Xī* (希),
What cannot be grasped is called *Wēi* (微).
These three cannot be summoned or invited,
Thus they merge into one.

Above, it does not blaze,
Below, it does not obscure—
*Shéngshéng* (绳绳) it cannot be named,
Returning once more to the formless.

This is called the *state without state*,
The *symbol without substance*—
This is called *huǎnghū* (恍惚).
Approach it, and you see no head,
Follow it, and you see no tail.

Holding to the ancient Dao,
To govern the present with the formless.
Able to know the ancient beginning,
This is called *Dao jì* (道纪).

The Dao of the constant is the beginning of *Tài Chū* (太初),
Thus it is *Yī* (均) and cannot be seen.
The Dao of Heaven is the beginning of *Tài Shǐ* (太始),
Thus it is *Xī* (希) and cannot be heard.
The Dao of Earth is the beginning of *Tài Sù* (太素),
Thus it is *Wēi* (微) and cannot be grasped.

These three are the beginnings of *qì*, form, and substance—
Cannot be summoned or questioned,
Thus they merge into one.

One is the harmonized unity of *yīn* and *yáng* before division.
Above, there is no accumulated *yáng*,
Thus it does not blaze.
Below, there is no concentrated *yīn*,
Thus it does not obscure.
*Yīn* and *yáng* intermingle,
No grasp can name it—
Thus *shéngshéng* (绳绳) it cannot be named.
Though called *yīn* and *yáng*,
Yet *yīn* and *yáng* cannot be separated—
Thus it returns once more to the formless.

This is called the *state without state*—
The Dao of Earth before division.
The *symbol without substance*—
The Dao of Heaven before division.
When the Dao of Heaven and Earth is yet undivided,
Then *yīn* and *yáng* are inseparable—
Thus it is called *huǎnghū* (恍惚).

If so, approaching it you see no head—
Who knows its origin?
Following it you see no tail—
Who knows its end?

Here is the translation:

---

Now, if one wishes to practice and uphold this,
Then only by grasping the ancient Dao can one govern the present forms.

The ancient is Heaven and Earth.
The present forms are *xíng* (形).
If one can grasp the Dao of Heaven and Earth to govern *xíng*,
Then *xíng* will naturally align itself.

The ancient origin is One—
The source of Heaven and Earth—
Thus it is called *Dàojì* (道纪).

**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Sage Who Mastered the Dao**

The ancient sage who mastered the Dao was subtle, mysterious, and profound—
So deep that none could fathom him.

Since he could not be fathomed,
He feigned outward appearances:
Cautious as one crossing a river in winter,
Timid as if fearing neighbors on all sides,
Solemn as a guest,
Dissolving like ice about to melt,
Sincere as uncarved wood,
Vast as a valley,
Turbulent as muddy water.

Who can settle the muddy and let it gradually clear?
Who can remain still and let movement arise naturally?

Those who preserve this Dao do not seek fullness.
Only by not seeking fullness
Can one endure decay without losing one’s original nature.

The ancient sage who mastered the Dao
Mastered the subtle mysteries of the Way,
Penetrated the profound mysteries of Heaven’s Dao,
And grasped the subtle essence of Earth’s Dao—
Thus he was called *subtle, mysterious, and profound*.

Though inwardly he penetrated the subtle mysteries,
Outwardly he remained unfathomable—
Thus, when viewed externally, he only feigned these appearances.

Cautious yet following movement naturally—
Like one crossing a river in winter.
Silent yet still—
Like one fearing neighbors on all sides.
Neither active nor passive,
Yet dignified as a guest—
These three are outward appearances.

Yet outwardly cautious while inwardly like a valley—
Vast and without thought.
Outwardly fearful while inwardly like uncarved wood—
Sincere and without desire.
Outwardly like a guest while inwardly dissolving—
Like ice melting without attachment.

Because inwardly he was dissolving, like uncarved wood, like a valley,
He aligned with the true Dao—
Thus he was called *subtle, mysterious, and profound*.

Because outwardly he appeared cautious, fearful, like a guest,
Yet did not reveal himself—
Thus he was called *unfathomable*.

Though appearing thus,
He blended with the common flow—
Thus he was turbulent like muddy water.

Who can settle the muddy and let it gradually clear?
Who can remain still and let movement arise naturally?
Only those who penetrate the profound and grasp the subtle can do so.

Muddy is the body of Earth.
Stillness is the Dao of Earth.
If one follows Earth’s Dao,
Then gradually it will clear—
For Earth naturally follows Heaven.

Stillness is the body of Heaven.
Movement is the Dao of Heaven.
If one follows Heaven’s Dao,
Then gradually life will arise—
For Heaven naturally follows the Dao.

To preserve this Dao,
Only the sage who masters it does so—
Thus he does not seek fullness.
Only by not seeking fullness
Can one endure decay and hold fast to the original,
Without abandoning the root for the new.

**Chapter Sixteen: The Chapter on Attaining the Extremes of Emptiness**

Attain the extremes of emptiness,
Guard stillness with sincerity.
When all things flourish together,
I observe their return.

All things teeming, each returns to its root.
Returning to the root is called stillness,
Stillness is called restoring the vital breath.
Restoring the vital breath is called constancy,
Knowing constancy is called enlightenment.
Not knowing constancy brings misfortune.
Knowing constancy and embracing it—
Embracing it makes it universal,
Universal makes it sovereign,
Sovereign makes it Heavenly,
Heavenly makes it Dao,
Dao makes it enduring,
And death cannot harm the body.

Emptiness and stillness are the root of all things.
Manifesting Heaven’s function,
Attaining the extremes of emptiness,
Following Earth’s substance,
Guarding stillness with sincerity—
When all things flourish together,
The sage observes their return,
Illuminating the principles of things to transform humanity.

Even grasses and trees are of Earth’s kind—
Their roots below, their branches above,
Following Earth’s Dao and remaining still.
Humans are of Heaven’s kind—
Their roots above, their branches below,
Following Heaven’s Dao and moving.

All things teeming, each returns to its root—
When all things are nurtured without comparison, this is the original root,
And it can be observed in Heaven.

Thus the sage said:
*"Flowers and leaves return to their fruit,
Stems and leaves to their roots—
The Dao returns to its origin,
At the yellow cavity between the brows."*

This is what is meant.

Returning to the root is called stillness—
Only stillness follows Earth’s substance,
And thus one can restore one’s nature.

Stillness is called restoring the vital breath—
Stillness allows gradual clarity,
And only clarity manifests Heaven’s function,
Thus one can restore the vital breath.

The *Tàiyī* (太一) governs life,
Its root is in the *níwán* (泥丸).
Thus *Tàiyī* is the totality of Heaven and Earth’s Dao—
This is called constancy.

When Heaven and Earth’s Dao are unified as One,
One gradually enters the true constancy—
Thus restoring the vital breath is called constancy.

Knowing and guarding constancy,
Spirit arises from it,
Enlightenment emerges from it—
All originating from One—
Thus knowing constancy is called enlightenment.

Enlightenment is the union of *yīn* and *yáng* as One.
Not knowing constancy is to abandon Heaven and Earth’s Dao
And harbor delusions,
Following things as they shift,
Straying into misfortune,
Forever losing the true Dao—
Thus misfortune arises.

Knowing constancy and embracing it—
This is knowing Heaven and Earth’s Dao.
Between Heaven and Earth, there is nothing it does not contain—
What private interest could there be?
Thus it is said: *Embracing makes it universal.*

The sovereign embodies Heaven and Earth’s impartiality,
Yet achieves his own ends through it—
Thus it is said: *Universal makes it sovereign.*

The sovereign embodies Heaven and Earth’s Dao,
And his essence aligns upward—
Thus it is said: *Sovereign makes it Heavenly.*

Heaven is One and vast—
Thus it is said: *Heavenly makes it Dao.*

The Dao precedes Heaven and Earth,
Endures through countless ages,
Without beginning or end—
Thus it is said: *Dao makes it enduring.*

Enduring is the constancy of the Dao—
Those who know constancy
Thus their bodies are not harmed by death.

**Chapter Seventeen: The Supreme Sage**

The Supreme Sage—
Below, he knows existence;

The next level, they are honored and praised;
The next, they are feared and insulted.
Trust is insufficient, yet still distrustful.
Thus, it is said: *How much the Sage values speech.*

When deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,
The people all say virtue arises naturally.

The Great Dao is formless—
Yin and Yang blend into One.
One gives birth to Heaven and Earth,
Heaven and Earth give birth to all things,
From formless to form.

In the age of the Supreme Sage,
The ruler of all under Heaven acts without action,
And fulfills Heaven’s virtue alone.
The common folk know of their ruler,
Yet what imperial power could there be over me?
Thus it is said: *The Supreme Sage, below knows his existence*—
This is the return to the Great Dao’s formlessness.

In the middle ages, the Sage’s benevolence extends to the people,
And the people naturally grow close and praise him—
Thus it is said: *The next, they are honored and praised*—
This is the return to Heaven’s Dao lacking affection.

In later ages, emperors and kings enforce laws to bring order,
And the people naturally grow fearful—
Thus it is said: *The next, they are feared*—
This is the return to Earth’s Dao lacking desire.

Extending through several generations,
Laws breed deceit, edicts spawn trickery—
Thus it is said: *The next, they are insulted*—
This is the return to the King’s Dao of rectitude.

To take trust from people through laws and edicts,
Trust is insufficient, and distrust remains.
Thus, at the beginning of the Supreme Sage,
He practices the teaching of no-speech—
Thus it is said: *How much the Sage values speech.*

When deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,
The people all say it is natural—
Then there is no honoring, praising, fearing, or insulting,
No distrust.

**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao Declines**

When the Great Dao declines,
There arises benevolence and righteousness;
When wisdom emerges,
There arises great deceit;
When familial bonds fracture,
There arises filial piety and kindness;
When the state falls into chaos,
There arise loyal ministers.

When the Great Dao declines, why does benevolence and righteousness arise?
Benevolence can be feigned, righteousness can be lacking—
Because it is contrary to the constant Dao of non-action,
Thus the Great Dao declines.

When wisdom emerges, why does great deceit arise?
Wisdom has knowledge, kindness has perception—
Because it is contrary to Heaven’s Dao of non-knowledge,
Thus great deceit arises.

When familial bonds fracture, why does filial piety and kindness arise?
The filial revere their own kin, the kind cherish their own children—
Because it is contrary to Earth’s Dao of non-desire,
Thus familial bonds fracture.

When the state falls into chaos, why do loyal ministers arise?
They see peril and risk their lives in admonition—
Because it is contrary to the King’s Dao of rectitude,
Thus loyal ministers’ virtue is displayed.

The Great Dao is vast and unfathomable,
Neither declining nor flourishing—
Ancient and modern are unchanged,
Yet people ruin it themselves—
This is the natural course of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang.
Yet when exhausted, it transforms;
When transformed, it flows;
When flowing, it endures.

The Sage, ruling all under Heaven with the Dao,
Gathers at seven without relying on it,
Is light on righteousness without accumulation,
The people return to simplicity and purity,
And wisdom fades away.
People lack craftiness, deceit ceases,
Wind and customs become pure, filial piety and kindness vanish,
One becomes upright, and loyal ministers naturally comply—
This is called the utmost governance.

**Chapter Nineteen: Discarding the Sage and Wisdom**

Discard the Sage, abandon wisdom,
The people benefit a hundredfold;
Discard benevolence, abandon righteousness,
The people return to filial piety and kindness;
Discard cleverness, abandon profit,
Thieves and robbers vanish.

These three things, though called culture,
Are insufficient—
Thus they must be assigned.

Seeing simplicity, embracing purity,
Few desires, little private interest.

Does the Dao descend and virtue decline
To delight the Sage?
Is this flattering through art to delight wisdom?
Is this flattering through flaws to delight benevolence?
Is this confusing virtue to delight righteousness?
Is this contrary to the governance of all under Heaven,
And thus disturbing the natural state of life?

Thus, the Sage does not consider many talents as sageliness,
Does not consider ruling people as wisdom—
Instead, he embodies Heaven’s Dao of non-knowledge,
And the people benefit a hundredfold.

He does not consider loving things as benevolence,
Does not consider establishing self as righteousness—
Thus he discards benevolence and righteousness,
And embodies the Great Dao of non-action,
And filial piety and kindness return to obscurity.

He does not consider strange things as cleverness,
Does not consider wealth as profit—
Thus he discards cleverness and profit,
And embodies Earth’s Dao of non-desire,
And thieves and robbers vanish.

Thus, the people naturally return to their true nature
And recover their original state.

Sageliness and wisdom,
Benevolence and righteousness,
Cleverness and profit—
These three things,
Through culture, extinguish the natural,
Lose their original simplicity,
And cause the people to lack sufficiency,
Teach the people to rebel,
Agitate the people to thievery—
Because culture is insufficient,
Thus they must be assigned.

Seeing simplicity is to embody Heaven and Earth’s Dao.
The enlightened enter simplicity,
And simplicity naturally reduces private interest.

Embracing purity is to embody the constant Dao.
Thus, the non-acting return to purity,
And purity naturally reduces desire.

**Chapter Twenty: Discarding Learning, No Worries**

---

How far apart are *yes* and *no*?
How different are *good* and *evil*?

What people fear,
I cannot but fear.

How vast and boundless it is!

The crowd bustles and rejoices,
As if feasting on the grandest sacrificial meat,
As if ascending the spring platform.

I alone am timid, as yet unmarked,
Like an infant before it can speak,
Drifting, drifting, as if without direction.

The crowd all has abundance,
I alone seem abandoned—
My heart, a fool’s heart, is pure and simple.

The common folk are bright and discerning,
I alone seem dim and obscured;
The common folk are keen and observant,
I alone am muddled and dull.

Serene as the sea, it knows no end,
Rising like a boundless wind—
The crowd all has means,
I alone am stubborn, as if coarse.

I alone differ from others,
In that I prize nourishment from the Mother.

Culture extinguishes the natural,
And erudition drowns the heart—
Only then do the people begin to stray and confuse,
Unable to return to their true nature
And recover their original state.

Thus, the flaws of sageliness and wisdom,
The chaos of virtue and righteousness,
The theft of cleverness and profit—
These three things, because culture is insufficient,
Therefore the Sage discards the learning of contrived action,
Dwells in the affairs of non-action—
What worries could there be?

How far apart are *yes* and *no*?
How different are *good* and *evil*?

For those who learn, distinctions arise of their own accord,
And they lose their true nature, harming life alike.

What people fear,
Is the loss of life—
Learning multiplies ways to lose life,
And cannot but be feared.

This is why the Sage discards learning
Because of its many ways—
Thus, vast and boundless, he cannot be contained.

At the start of learning,
One practices in due season,
Bustling and joyful,
So it feasts on the finest sacrificial flavors
And loses its natural tranquility,
Ascends the spring platform for viewing
And loses its quiet solitude.

I alone am timid, treasuring the beginning of Heaven and Earth,
Like an infant before it can speak—
Drifting, drifting, its movements seem without purpose.

In the midst of learning,
Knowledge and perception multiply daily,
Each day bringing gain,
So all have abundance—
But I, for the Dao, am daily diminished,
Seem abandoned—
Between movement and stillness,
Heaven’s spontaneity does not unfold,
Yet silently aligns with the Dao.
Pure and simple, I do not conform to the scheming of the virtuous.

At the end of learning,
Culture surpasses substance,
And brightness shines like the unveiled sun and moon.
Erudition triumphs, drowning the heart,
Discernment reveals depths like fish in the sea—
I alone guard the original root,
Dim as if without outward vision,
Muddled as if without outward communication,
Vast as if forgotten, still as if at rest—
Seeming without end.

From the start to the extreme,
All are shaped by accumulated habits,
So all have means—
I alone am coarse and simple,
Without means at all.

Then, what makes me different from others?
Only that I prize nourishment from the Mother.

Heaven and Earth are the Mother of all things,
And people all consume grains and the five flavors—
But I alone consume the *qi* of the Great Harmony of yin and yang,
Thus I do not perish—
This is how I differ.

**Chapter Twenty-One: The Sage’s Virtue and Appearance**
---

The Sage’s virtue and appearance,
Follow the Dao alone.

**Chapter Twenty-One: The Nature of the Dao**

The Dao as a thing,
Is but vague and indistinct.
Indistinct and vague,
Yet within it lies an image;
Vague and indistinct,
Yet within it lies a substance.

Deep and dark,
Within it is essence—
Its essence most true,
Within it is trust.

From ancient times to now,
Its name has never vanished,
For it encompasses all beings.

How do I know all beings are thus?
By this.

The *Kong* (孔) is from *zi* (子) to *yi* (乙),
Where the three yang reside.
Between the boundless and the dark,
The *Bu* (乾) Dao possesses true essence,
The moment when it responds to things.

*Virtue* (德) is the Dao within me.
*Appearance* (容) is my form resembling Heaven and Earth.

If one attains this moment of true essence
And returns to my Heaven and Earth,
Then the Dao will naturally come to me—
Thus it is said: *The Sage’s Virtue and Appearance, follow the Dao alone.*

The Dao as a thing,
Is but vague and indistinct—
This is spoken of in terms of yin and yang.

*Virtue* (德) as a thing,
Is form and substance—
Thus the Dao as a thing,
Is yin and is yang.

The vague (恍兮) is when the Dao in Heaven becomes yang,
Yang within contains yin—
Thus it is said: *vague and indistinct.*

Responding to things is *spirit* (神),
Spirit is the presence of the formless—
Saying it is in Heaven—
Thus it is said: *within it lies a substance.*

The indistinct (惚兮) is when the Dao on Earth becomes yin,
Yin within contains yang—
Thus it is said: *indistinct and vague.*

Responding to things is *qi* (氣),
Qi is the presence of the void within substance—
Saying it is on Earth—
Thus it is said: *within it lies an image.*

Deep and dark,
Within it is essence—
Between Heaven and Earth, yin and yang coexist,
Transforming endlessly,
Thus forming the essence of things.
I ponder this Dao,
Originating from the deep and dark.

Its essence most true,
Responds to the *Upper Primordial* (上元).
Within it is trust,
Meaning it never fails in response.

The Dao endures from ancient times to now,
Thus from ancient times to now,
Its name has never vanished.
Heaven and Earth are the *origin* (甫) of all things,
Within me, my form resembles Heaven and Earth—
This is called *encompassing all beings.*

It must be called *origin* (甫),
For Heaven and Earth have the function of a father.

How do I know all beings are thus?
Essence gathers into spirit,
Spirit transforms into qi,
Qi transforms into things—
Between transformations, the cycle is endless,
The changes of all beings pass without ceasing—
Thus all things cannot help but be born,
Cannot help but die.
The Sage values essence,
For spirit can avoid death,
Can avoid birth.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: The Doctrine of Flexibility and Completeness**

Flexible yields completeness,
Crooked yields straightness,
Hollow yields fullness,
Exhausted yields renewal,
Little yields acquisition,
Much yields confusion.

Thus the Sage embraces *Oneness* (一) as the model for all under Heaven.
Not self-assertive, hence clear;
Not self-righteous, hence illustrious;
Not self-praising, hence fruitful;
Not self-conceited, hence enduring.

Only because he does not contend,
None under Heaven can contend with him.

The ancients said, *"Flexible yields completeness"*—
Is this not true?
Indeed, it is complete and returns to its source.

The constant Dao responds to things without contention,
Thus it is said: *Flexible yields completeness.*

The Earth Dao is great and straight,
Yet appears bent—
Thus it is said: *Crooked yields straightness.*

The Heaven Dao is boundless and void,
Yet appears like a valley—
Thus it is said: *Hollow yields fullness.*

The *Kingly Dao* (王道) upholds simplicity and does nothing—
Thus it is said: *Exhausted yields renewal.*

These four principles,
Are the four great domains of the world—
Though divided into four great domains,
They are in fact rooted in one Dao,
One Dao alone.

Heaven attains it to be clear,
Earth attains it to be tranquil,
The sovereign attains it to be the *orthodox* (貞) of all under Heaven—
Thus it is said: *Little yields acquisition.*

If one descends from the root to the branches,
And engages in artificial action,
Then one is bound by desires—
Countless ages cannot exhaust them—
Thus it is said: *Much yields confusion.*

Thus the Sage knows the *Supreme Dao* (至道) is not troublesome,
Different paths converge in the same meeting—
Hence he embraces *Oneness* as the model for all under Heaven.

In this way, he embodies the fourfold Dao,
To respond to the world without bearing its burdens.

Not self-assertive,
Embodying the *Flexible yields completeness* Dao—
Hence he is clear.

Not self-righteous,
Embodying the *Crooked yields straightness* Dao—
Hence he is illustrious.

Not self-praising,
Embodying the *Hollow yields fullness* Dao—
Hence he is fruitful.

Not self-conceited,
Embodying the *Exhausted yields renewal* Dao—
Hence he endures.

Yet in responding to things,
He always takes the constant Dao as his root—
The constant Dao does not contend with all things—
Thus Heaven and Earth cannot contend with him.

The ancients said, *"Flexible yields completeness"*—
Is this not true?
Indeed, it is complete and returns to its source.

**Chapter Twenty-Three: The Rarity of Natural Speech**

Rarely speaking naturally,
Thus gusts of wind do not last the morning,
Sudden rains do not last the day.

Who does this?
Heaven and Earth.

Heaven and Earth cannot endure long,
How much less so people?

Thus those who follow the Dao,
Those who follow the Dao align with the Dao,
Those who follow virtue align with virtue,
Those who lose align with loss.

Aligning with the Dao,
The Dao also attains them;
Aligning with virtue,
Virtue also attains them;
Aligning with loss,
Loss also attains them.

Lacking trust is untrustworthy.
Heaven says nothing—
Only listens without hearing.

Rare speech is the Heaven Dao,
Thus it is always natural.

Gusts of wind and sudden rains,
Are the transient *qi* of Heaven and Earth.

Heaven and Earth are not constant,
And yet cannot endure long—
If people are not constant,
How can their virtue follow the Dao?

Thus those who follow the Dao,
Embody the vast Dao as boundless and void,
Preserve and give birth to it—
They align with the Dao.

Embody the Upper Virtue as clear and tranquil,
Guard and nurture it—
They align with virtue.

Like gusts of wind and sudden rains,
Which are not constant,
Then they revert to madness and blindness,
Bearing self-blame—
They align with loss.

Aligning with the Dao,
They ascend to the *Southern Palace* (南宮),
This is the Dao attained.

Aligning with virtue,
They prolong life and years—
This is virtue attained.

Aligning with loss,
They connect with the *Ghostly Dao* (鬼道),
This is loss attained.

「The three ways of gaining trust in others
Are all necessary tokens of their ultimate fate—
If trust is insufficient,
Then doubt will arise.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Stilted Do Not Stand**
The stilted cannot stand,
The striding cannot walk,
The self-observing cannot see clearly,
The self-righteous cannot be manifest,
The self-praising achieve no merit,
The self-conceited cannot endure.

In the Dao,
They are called *excessive consumption* and *superfluous actions*.
Some may detest them,
Thus those who follow the Dao do not dwell here.
The stilted set themselves up,
So they do not stand firm.

If one embodies the Dao of Earth,
Silent and without desire,
They stand alone and never waver.
The striding act for themselves,
So they do not walk steadily.

If one embodies the Dao of Heaven,
Lofty and without scheming,
They traverse the world without faltering.

As for self-observation, self-righteousness, self-praise, and self-conceit,
All are self-made faults,
Comparable to the stilted and striding.
Thus they contradict the teachings of the earlier chapters.

Those who do so,
In the Dao, indulge in *excessive consumption* beyond what is allotted,
And in *superfluous actions* beyond virtue’s path—
These are all those who love fullness.
Some detest fullness,
Thus those who follow the Dao do not dwell here.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Primordial Unity**
There is a Primordial Unity,
Born before Heaven and Earth.

Silent and lofty,
It stands alone and never changes,
Traverses the world without faltering—
Thus it may be called the Mother of all things.

I do not know its name,
So I call it *Dao* and forcefully name it *Great*.
Great is *passing*,
Passing is *distant*,
Distant is *returning*.

Thus the Dao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
And the Sage-King is great.
Within the realm there are four great things,
And the Sage-King occupies one.

People follow Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the Dao,
The Dao follows *Naturalness*.

When *qi* takes form and substance yet remains undivided, it is called *Primordial Unity*.
If there is a Primordial Unity,
Then the undivided yet unseparated is it.

When form begins to change and becomes one,
This One gives birth to Heaven and Earth—
Thus it is said to be born before Heaven and Earth.

Speaking of the Dao,
Silent and unchanging,
Its root lies in *True Constancy*—
How could it ever waver?

Speaking of Earth,
Lofty and ever-transforming,
Its transformations are in *Mysterious Application*—
How could it ever falter?

Speaking of Heaven,
Only after Heaven and Earth arise do all things come into being—
Thus it is said to be the Mother of all things.

When discussing all things under Heaven,
They begin with the transformation of form,
Thus its name is unknown—
It is called *Dao*.

Above, no further origin exists,
So forcefully it is named *Great*.

The Dao separates from the Primordial Unity,
And Heaven and Earth begin to divide.
Heaven attains the Dao,
Moving without accumulation—
Thus *Great* is called *passing*.
Light and clear become Heaven,
Heavy and turbid become Earth—
Heaven moves without accumulation,
Earth is vast without bounds—
Thus *passing* is called *distant*.
Heaven and Earth contain the *Essential Qi*,
And all things transform and are born.
Descending from origin to extremity,
The farther they stray from the Dao,
The more they accumulate—
Thus *distant* is called *returning*.

Only the Sage-King stands independent above all things,
Transforming all things without being burdened by them,
In unity with the Dao,
And in function with Heaven and Earth.

Heaven and Earth are what the ancients called *Great*.
What then does the Sage-King who rules all under Heaven do?
He merely embodies *Heavenly Virtue*.

Thus the Dao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
And the Sage-King is great.
Within the realm there are four great things,
And the Sage-King occupies one—
The Dao, Heaven, and Earth
All attain *Oneness* to be great,
But only the Sage-King is one who follows the Dao,
And his *Oneness* surpasses even the union of Heaven and Earth—
Thus he is great as well.

From the beginning of Primordial Unity,
*Voidness* and *Nothingness* give birth to *Naturalness*,
*Naturalness* gives birth to the Dao,
The Dao gives birth to *Oneness*,
*Oneness* gives birth to Heaven and Earth,
And Heaven and Earth give birth to all things—
If one can reverse this law,
And return to the origin,
They will once again align with *Naturalness*.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Heavy as Root of the Light**
The heavy is the root of the light,
The tranquil is the sovereign of the restless.

Thus the Sage-King never leaves his *burden* (车辎) all day,
Though there are palaces and pleasures,
He rests in the lofty and detached.

How can the ruler of ten thousand chariots
Lighten his body over all under Heaven?
Lightness leads to losing his ministers,
Restlessness leads to losing his sovereignty.
The heavy can govern the light,
Thus the heavy is the root of the light.
The tranquil can control the restless,
Thus the tranquil is the sovereign of the restless.

These two principles
Are the fundamental roots of the Dao.

The Sage-King knows that the Dao’s fundamental roots lie here,
Thus he never leaves his *burden* all day.

The carriage, with its *voidness* as essence,
And *nothingness* as function,
Guards tranquility within,
And bears its own weight—
Thus externally it governs the light and restless wheels and spokes.

The Sage-King practices this,
So though there are palaces and pleasures of lightness and restlessness,
He rests in the heavy and tranquil,
Lofty and detached,
Never letting them cling to his heart.

If the heavy and tranquil are such,
How can the ruler of ten thousand chariots
Lighten his body over all under Heaven?

Lightness leads to losing the heavy—
His body does not rest.
Restlessness leads to losing tranquility—
His spirit does not ascend.

The Dao of ministers is especially to be rooted in self-weight,
The Dao of the sovereign is especially to be valued in guarding tranquility—
The Dao of sovereign and minister alike
Follows the principle of lightness and restlessness.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Art of the Good**
The good in action leaves no tracks,
The good in speech leaves no flaws,
The good in calculation does not rely on measures,
The good in closing requires no bolts yet cannot be opened,
The good in binding requires no cords yet cannot be undone.

Thus the Sage-King is always good at saving people,
And so there are none abandoned—
Always good at saving things,
And so there are none cast aside.
This is called *following clarity*.

Thus the good person,
Is the teacher of the not-good,
And the not-good,
Is the resource of the good.

If one does not honor their teacher,
Or cherish their resource,
Even with great wisdom they are greatly confused—
This is called *the essential subtlety*.

To traverse the six *voids* without tracks,
None are better than the *Great Dao*.
To speak of goodness without flaws,
To act without scheming measures,
None are better than the *Heavenly Dao*.

To store the *True Essence* of *Great Harmony* without bolts,
To bind the *Mysterious Function* of *Primordial Unity* without cords—
None are better than the *Earthly Dao*.

「Thus the Sage, throughout their day, moves without abandoning their baggage—
Yet leaves no tracks behind;
They teach without speaking—
Yet leave no flaws unaddressed;
They embrace *Oneness* as a model for all under Heaven—
Yet employ no scheming measures;
They harbor the Spirit within—
Yet no bolts can keep it sealed, nor can it be opened;
They return to the Mother of all under Heaven—
Yet no cords can bind it, nor can it be undone.

To embody this Dao,
They are ever skilled at saving people—
And each finds rest in their own customs,
No one left untouched by its transformation.
They are ever skilled at saving things—
And each fulfills its own nature,
No thing left unnurtured by its care—
This is called *the Sage who embodies the Dao*,
Hence it is said: *following clarity*.

Only the Sage excels in this,
And so becomes the teacher of the unvirtuous.
The common folk do not excel in this,
Yet still are touched by its transformation—
And so become the resource of the virtuous.
Those touched by its transformation,
All say, "This is my natural state,"
And thus do not honor their teacher.
Those who excel in this,
Yet dwell not in themselves—
And thus do not cherish their resource.
The Sage acts thus,
Not to enlighten the people,
But to befuddle them.

If the *flowering* of wisdom is its splendor,
Then it will turn against this Dao—
This is called *great confusion*.
Only those who forget both extremes,
Who hold nothing dear—
This is called *the essential subtlety*.

**Chapter XXVIII: Knowing the Heroic Virtue**
Know the Heroic and cherish the Feminine—
This is the *valley* of all under Heaven.
As the *valley* of all under Heaven,
Their *virtue/power* never departs—
And returns to the *Infant of the Feminine*.

Know the White and cherish the Black—
This is the *model* of all under Heaven.
As the *model* of all under Heaven,
Their *virtue/power* is never flawed—
And returns to the *Boundless*.

Know the Prosperous and cherish the Humble—
This is the *valley* of all under Heaven.
As the *valley* of all under Heaven,
Their *virtue/power* is ever sufficient—
And returns to the *Uncarved*.

The *Uncarved* scatters and becomes *vessels*—
The Sage uses it and becomes the *officials and leaders*,
Thus the grandest measures cannot sever the *Way of Non-action*.

The *Heroic* is the Yang,
The *Feminine* is the Yin.
If one knows the *Heroic* at the peak of the utmost Yang,
And cherishes the *Feminine* at the source of the utmost Yin,
Then their *nurturing* is constant—
And returns to the *Earthly Dao*,
Thus it is the *valley* of all under Heaven.
A mountain ravine is a small *valley*,
But the Earth is the *valley* of all under Heaven.

Though they act upon things,
Yet nothing is left to them—
This is called *their virtue/power never departs*.
If one can embody the *Earthly Dao*,
Honoring nourishment and depth,
Then they return to the *Infant of the Feminine*.

Day is the White,
Night is the Black.
If one knows the White at the height of the day,
And cherishes the Black in the time of the night,
Then day and night are preserved—
And align with the *Heavenly Dao*,
Thus it is the *model* of all under Heaven.
The *model* of a kingdom is but one nation’s pattern,
But the *Heavenly Dao* is the *model* of all under Heaven.

The *True Essence* reaches its peak—
Yet still remains within—
This is called *their virtue/power is never flawed*.
If one can embody the *Way of Oneness*,
Adjusting and yielding above to below,
Then they return to the *Boundless*.

The *spreading* of life is Prosperous,
The *carving* of form is Humble.
If one knows the Prosperous at the beginning of life’s spreading,
And cherishes the Humble after the carving of form,
Then they return to the Root and reclaim their Command—
And reverse to the *Heavenly Dao*,
Thus it is the *valley* of all under Heaven.
A mountain and marsh are small *valleys*,
But Heaven is the *valley* of all under Heaven.

Dwelling not in themselves,
Yet responding to all without exhaustion—
This is called *their virtue/power is ever sufficient*.
If one can embody the *Heavenly Dao*,
With serene simplicity and non-action,
Then they return to the *Uncarved*.

The *Uncarved* is the complete essence of the Dao,
Giving birth to Heaven and Earth.
When it scatters, it becomes *vessels*—
The light and pure become *Spirit-vessels*,
The heavy and coarse become *Utility-vessels*.
The *Spirit-vessels* are the *highest virtue/power*—
The *highest virtue/power* acts without doing,
And nothing is left to it—
Thus the *Spirit-vessels* of all under Heaven,
Cannot be wielded.
The *Utility-vessels* are the *lowest virtue/power*—
The *lowest virtue/power* acts and leaves traces—
Thus the *Utility-vessels* of a nation,
Cannot be shown to the people.

The Sage uses the *Uncarved* and becomes the *officials and leaders*—
Though Heaven and Earth carve and measure all things,
They cannot sever the *Way of Non-action*.

**Chapter XXIX: The Chapter of Taking Action**
Those who would take all under Heaven and act upon it,
I see them as not having reached the end of their means.

The *Spirit-vessels* of all under Heaven,
Cannot be wielded.
The *wielder* fails them,
The *grasper* loses them.
Thus things sometimes advance, sometimes retreat,
Sometimes rush forth, sometimes withdraw,
Sometimes grow strong, sometimes weak,
Sometimes ascend, sometimes descend.
Hence the Sage avoids excess, avoids extravagance, avoids grandeur.

Heaven and Earth endure long and last,
Because they constantly have no desires and act without doing—
Thus those who would take all under Heaven and act upon it,
I see them as not having reached the end of their means.

The reason they have not reached the end of their means,
Is that the *Spirit-vessels* of all under Heaven,
Cannot be wielded.
Yet the *Spirit-vessels* are profound and obscure,
Unfathomable and dark—
Wisdom cannot penetrate them—
Thus the *wielder* fails them,
And the *grasper* loses them.

Therefore, the things of all under Heaven,
When the Yang advances, the Yin follows;
When the Yang reaches its peak and rushes forth,
The Yin responds with withdrawal;
When the Yin grows strong,
Things will grow weak;
When the Yin reaches its peak and withdraws,
Things will follow suit.

Thus success and failure, gain and loss,
Are not known beforehand—
This is how those who would take all under Heaven and act upon it,
Are constrained by the numbers of Yin and Yang,
Yet still cannot escape their burdens.

Hence the Sage embodies the *Heavenly Dao*,
And wanders in the realm of *free and easy* non-action—
Thus it is said: *avoid excess*.
They embody the *Earthly Dao*,
And eat from the fields of *simple sustenance*—
Thus it is said: *avoid extravagance*.
They embody the *Great Dao*,
And dwell in the garden of *uncompromising* non-action—
Thus it is said: *avoid grandeur*.
This is not relying on all under Heaven,
Nor on ghosts and spirits,
Nor on all things—
Thus they suffer neither failure nor loss.

**Chapter XXX: Aiding the Ruler with the Dao**
To aid the ruler with the Dao,
Is not to use force to conquer all under Heaven—
Their affairs are fond of returning.

Where the army encamps,
Thorns and brambles spring up.
After a great campaign,
There must be years of hardship.
Thus the virtuous act only when necessary,
And dare not to conquer with force.

Acting when necessary,
Yet not boasting,
Acting when necessary,
Yet not claiming victory,
Acting when necessary,
Yet not growing arrogant,
Acting when necessary,
Yet not forcing—
Acting when necessary,
Yet not dominating.»

「When things grow robust, they age—
This is called *not* the Dao/Way,
And *not* the Dao/Way will come early.

Warfare is a *harsh* instrument,
Combat is a *perilous* affair,
Contention is *contrary to virtue/power*.
Thus, those who aid the ruler with the Dao/Way
Do not use force to conquer all under Heaven,
Their affairs fond of returning,
This is called *reverting to your own* Dao/Way.

Where the army encamps,
It seizes the labor of the people below,
Thus thorns and brambles spring up.
After a great campaign,
The ruler above disrupts the *harmony of Heaven*,
Thus there must be years of calamity.
Thus the virtuous act only when necessary,
And dare not rely on the strength of arms to claim victory over all under Heaven.
Understanding the text below,
Those who embody the Dao/Way of the *Great Way*:
Act when necessary, yet do not grow proud,
Thus their *virtue/power* endures;
Those who embody the Dao/Way of *Heaven*:
Act when necessary, yet do not boast,
Thus they achieve merit;
Those who embody the Dao/Way of *Earth*:
Act when necessary, yet do not grow arrogant,
Thus they incur no blame.

These three principles,
Though acting when necessary, yet not compelled,
Do not dare to rely on pride or arrogance to claim victory—
This is the meaning of *act when necessary, yet not force*.

To use force and strength,
Is to go against the Dao/Way,
Thus it is said: *not* the Dao/Way will come early.

**Chapter XXXI: On the *Illustrious* Army**
The *illustrious* army is an *auspicious* instrument,
Yet some may detest it,
Thus those who possess the Dao/Way do not dwell upon it.
Therefore, the virtuous ruler values the left in governance,
And values the right in warfare.
Warfare is an *auspicious* instrument,
Not the instrument of the virtuous,
Used only when unavoidable,
And *tranquility* is the highest ideal.
Thus it is not glorified,
For to glorify it would bring joy,
And those who take joy in it
Are those who take joy in killing others.
Those who take joy in killing others
Cannot fulfill their aspirations in all under Heaven.

Auspicious affairs are honored on the left,
Harsh affairs on the right.
Thus the *Junior General* is placed on the left,
And the *Senior General* on the right.
When occupying the highest position,
It is treated with funeral rites.
When many are killed,
It is mourned with sorrowful tears,
And when victorious in battle,
It is treated with funeral rites.
Warfare is the greatest *plunderer* of the people,
The harshest instrument under Heaven—
How much more so when it is *illustrious*?
This is called an *auspicious* instrument,
Yet some may detest it.
Those who detest it,
Are those who possess the Dao/Way and do not dwell upon it.

The virtuous ruler values the left in governance,
For the left is *yang* and governs life—
An auspicious affair.
In warfare, the right is valued,
For the right is *yin* and governs death—
A harsh affair.
Repeatedly speaking of an *auspicious* instrument,
Is a profound warning against warfare,
Thus it is not the instrument of the virtuous,
Used only when unavoidable,
With no desire to conquer others,
And *tranquility* is the highest ideal.
Though victorious, it is not glorified,
And even if glorified, those who take joy in killing others—
This is called the *illustrious* army.

The *illustrious* army is what Heaven detests,
How can it fulfill its aspirations under Heaven?
Thus auspicious affairs are honored on the left,
And harsh affairs on the right.
Therefore, the *Junior General* is placed on the left,
And the *Senior General* on the right—
This is called valuing the right in warfare.
When occupying the highest position,
It is treated with funeral rites—
This is called honoring harsh affairs on the right.
When many are killed,
It is mourned with sorrowful tears,
Thus victory in war is treated with funeral rites.

**Chapter XXXII: The Dao/Way is Ever Nameless**
The Dao/Way is ever nameless,
Yet the *Uncarved Block* (朴), though small,
All under Heaven dare not subject it.
If lords and kings could preserve it,
All things would come as guests.
When Heaven and Earth unite,
Sweet dew descends,
No one commands it, yet it is evenly distributed.

At first, the Dao/Way had no name,
Yet once named, the name already exists.
The Dao/Way, once in all under Heaven,
Is like streams and valleys to the rivers and seas.
The natural Dao/Way,
Is the origin of Heaven and Earth—
How could it be named?
Thus it is said: *nameless*.

The nameless is the Dao/Way blending into unity.
Heaven and Earth in their entirety,
Before differentiation, is called the *Uncarved Block*.
Heaven and Earth hold a single tiny thing in the void,
Thus the *Uncarved Block*, though small.

Yet the sage uses it to become *officials and leaders*,
And all under Heaven dare not subject it or humble themselves before it.

The heart is the ruler’s *official*,
The sovereign of the five *viscera*—
If one could preserve the Dao/Way of unity,
The body would be *emptied* and all things would come,
What would not come as guests?
When the heart is *non-acting* and *harmonious qi* returns,
Sweet dew descends,
No one commands it, yet it is evenly distributed.

At first, the Dao/Way was one.
The nameless is the mother of all things—
Heaven and Earth are such.
Only the one can govern Heaven and Earth,
Thus it is said: *At first, the Dao/Way had no name*.

Yet within us,
We should observe the Dao/Way of Heaven,
And once the name exists,
We should also know when to stop.
Those who know when to stop
Do not fall into peril.
The Dao/Way in all under Heaven,
Is like streams and valleys to the rivers and seas.
The natural Dao/Way,
Unites with the *essence/nature* (性).
The rivers and seas are good at descending,
Yet they do not desire the water of streams and valleys—
The water of streams and valleys naturally flows to them.
If people can know when to stop and be *emptied* and *non-acting*,
The Dao/Way is not desired—
The Dao/Way naturally returns to them.

**Chapter XXXIII: Knowing Others is Wisdom**
Knowing others is wisdom,
Knowing oneself is enlightenment.
Overcoming others is strength,
Overcoming oneself is power.

Knowing contentment is wealth,
Striving with vigor is aspiration.
Not losing one’s place is longevity,
Dying yet not perishing is life.

To act outwardly and observe others is wisdom,
To act inwardly and observe oneself is enlightenment,
Thus it is said: *Knowing others is wisdom, knowing oneself is enlightenment*.

To dare to act with boldness and govern others with firmness is strength,
To dare not to act and conquer oneself with gentleness is power,
Thus it is said: *Overcoming others is strength, overcoming oneself is power*.

Only the *perfected sage* (至人) strives to know oneself and not to know others,
Strives to overcome oneself and not to overcome others.

Their self-knowledge,
Embodies the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,
And external desires cannot move the heart,
Thus they settle contentedly in their portion—
This is called *knowing contentment is wealth*.

Their self-overcoming,
Embodies the Dao/Way of the *Great Way*,
And external things cannot conquer their aspiration,
Thus they strive endlessly—
This is called *striving with vigor is aspiration*.

External desires cannot move the heart,
This is to *conceal oneself within the body* and not emerge,
Thus it follows with *not losing one’s place is longevity*.」

「外物不能胜乎志者，心死於物而神存也，故继以死而不忘者寿。
The heart, though dead to external things, retains its spirit—
Thus, to die yet never forget is called *longevity*.

非体天地道者，孰能与於此哉？
Who, not embodying the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,
Could ever share in this?

**大道泛兮，章第三十四**
**The Great Way is boundless—Chapter Thirty-Four**

大道泛兮，其可左右。
The Great Way is boundless, yet it can be turned left or right.

万物恃之以生而不辞，功成不居。
All things rely upon it to live, yet it does not refuse,
Its deeds accomplished, it claims no credit.

衣被万物而不为主，故常无欲，可名於小矣；
It clothes and covers all things yet does not rule them,
Thus it ever lacks desire—
This may be called *the small*.

万物归之而不知主，可名於大矣。
All things return to it yet it knows no ruler—
This may be called *the great*.

是以圣人终不为大，故能成其大。
Therefore, the sage never claims to be great,
And thus is able to accomplish greatness.

阳可左而不可右，故能生而不能成。
The Yang can be turned left but not right,
Thus it can give birth yet cannot complete.

阴可右而不可左，故能成而不能生。
The Yin can be turned right but not left,
Thus it can complete yet cannot give birth.

唯大道泛兮，能阴能阳，能生能成，是以或左或右，无乎不可也。
Only the Great Way is boundless,
Capable of both Yin and Yang,
Of both giving birth and completing—
Thus it can be turned left or right without limit.

得此道以在天，故万物恃之以生而不辞；
To attain this Way in Heaven,
All things rely upon it to live, yet it does not refuse;

得此道以在地，故功成不名有。
To attain this Way on Earth,
Its deeds accomplished, it claims no credit.

生之者，天也。
The giver of birth is Heaven.

成之者，地也。
The completer is Earth.

天地之道，覆养万物而不为主，故常无欲。
The Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth
Nurtures and covers all things yet does not rule them,
Thus it ever lacks desire.

然天地肖道，其细也夫，故可名於小矣。
Yet Heaven and Earth resemble the Dao,
Though in their subtlety—
Thus they may be called *the small*.

惟大道泛兮，万物归之而不为主，故可名於大矣。
Only the Great Way is boundless,
All things return to it yet it knows no ruler—
Thus it may be called *the great*.

大者，道之强名也。
Greatness is the Dao’s forceful name.

是以圣人虚静无欲，体於天地，故终不为大，而常然之道不期而自归之，故能成其大也。
Therefore, the sage remains empty, tranquil, and without desire,
Embodying the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,
Never claiming greatness—
Yet the Way itself spontaneously returns,
Thus the sage accomplishes true greatness.

**执大象，章第三十五**
**Holding the Great Form—Chapter Thirty-Five**

执大象，天下往。
Holding the Great Form, the world comes.

往而不害，安平泰。
Coming yet causing no harm, it brings ease, tranquility, and boundless peace.

乐与饵，过客止。
Delight and bait—
Travelers pause when they arrive.

道之出言，淡乎其无味。
The Dao’s spoken expression is bland, without flavor.

视之不足见，听之不足闻，用之不可既。
To look upon it is insufficient to see,
To listen is insufficient to hear,
To use it is never to exhaust.

大象无形者，道也。
The Great Form without form is the Dao.

执大象，天下往者，以道莅天下也。
Holding the Great Form, the world comes—
This is to govern the world with the Dao.

有道则民之攸坚，故往而不害，安平泰。
When the Dao is present, the people have a firm foundation,
Thus coming yet causing no harm,
It brings ease, tranquility, and boundless peace.

盖法天道虚而容，故安而不扰；
It follows the Dao/Way of Heaven—
Empty yet all-encompassing,
Thus it brings ease without disturbance.

法地道载而宁，故平而不陂；
It follows the Dao/Way of Earth—
Bearing yet tranquil,
Thus it brings tranquility without unevenness.

法大道和而通，故泰而不塞。
It follows the Great Way—
Harmonious yet open,
Thus it brings boundless peace without obstruction.

若是者，物物不干，何害之有？
If such is the case,
Things do not interfere with one another—
What harm could there be?

世之人悦於声，而不知天道。
People of the world delight in sound,
Yet they do not know the Dao/Way of Heaven.

所谓声声者，美於味，而不知地道。
What is called *sound-sound* (聲聲),
Is pleasing to the palate,
Yet they do not know the Dao/Way of Earth.

所谓味味者，故着於嗜欲而久处之，不知有道者以此为蘧庐尔。
What is called *flavor-flavor* (味味),
They cling to their cravings and dwell long therein,
Those who do not know the Dao
Take this as their *hut of decay*.

乐以声言也，声之所声者彰矣，而声声者未尝发。
Delight is expressed through sound,
The source of sound is clear,
Yet *sound-sound* never truly emits.

饵以味言也，味之所味者尝矣，而味味者未尝呈。
Bait is expressed through flavor,
The source of flavor is tasted,
Yet *flavor-flavor* never truly presents.

道之出江，淡乎其无味，则所谓声声味味者也。
The Dao’s emergence is like water—
Bland, without flavor,
Thus it is what is called *sound-sound* and *flavor-flavor*.

以道莅天下者，得大道泰而妙，故视之不足见；
To govern the world with the Dao,
One attains the Great Way’s boundless peace and subtlety,
Thus to look upon it is insufficient to see;

得天道安而玄，故听之不足闻；
One attains the Dao/Way of Heaven’s ease and profundity,
Thus to listen is insufficient to hear;

得地道平而广，故用之不可既。
One attains the Dao/Way of Earth’s tranquility and vastness,
Thus to use it is never to exhaust.

直将还一世於澹泊，岂使民以嗜欲累其心哉？
Rather, it would return the world to simplicity and stillness,
How could it burden the people with cravings?

**将欲歙之，章第三十六**
**When One is About to Withdraw It—Chapter Thirty-Six**

将欲歙之，必固张之；
When one is about to withdraw it, one must first firmly expand it.

将欲弱之，必固强之；
When one is about to weaken it, one must first firmly strengthen it.

将欲废之，必固兴之；
When one is about to abandon it, one must first firmly establish it.

将欲夺之，必固与之。
When one is about to take it away, one must first firmly give it.

是谓微明。
This is called *subtle clarity*.

柔之胜刚，弱之胜强。
Softness overcomes hardness,
Weakness overcomes strength.

鱼不可脱於渊，国之利器，不可以一不人。
Fish cannot be removed from the depths,
Nation’s *sharp tools*—
They cannot be used without harm.

利器示人，欲心乱矣。
To display *sharp tools* to others,
The desire-heart is thrown into disorder.

唯有道者体天道之虚，於吾心本无所张也，何必歙之？
Only those who possess the Dao embody the Dao/Way of Heaven’s emptiness,
In my heart, there is originally nothing to expand—
Why must I withdraw it?

将欲歙之者，必固张之而已。
When one is about to withdraw it,
One must first firmly expand it—
That is all.

体大道之夷，於吾欲心本无所强也，何必弱之？
Embodying the Great Way’s simplicity,
In my desire-heart, there is originally nothing to strengthen—
Why must I weaken it?

将欲弱之者，必固强之而已。
When one is about to weaken it,
One must first firmly strengthen it—
That is all.

体王道之正，於吾欲心本无所兴也，何又废之？
Embodying the *Kingly Way’s* rectitude,
In my desire-heart, there is originally nothing to establish—
Why must I abandon it?

将欲废之者，必固兴之而已。
When one is about to abandon it,
One must first firmly establish it—
That is all.

体地道之静，於吾欲心本无所与也，何必夺之？
Embodying the Dao/Way of Earth’s stillness,
In my desire-heart, there is originally nothing to give—
Why must I take it away?

将欲夺之者，必固与之而已。
When one is about to take it away,
One must first firmly give it—
That is all.

此四者，皆欲於利器。
These four actions all concern the use of *sharp tools*.

利器者地道，故是谓微明。
*Sharp tools* are the Dao/Way of Earth,
Thus this is called *subtle clarity*.

何则？
Why?

柔弱处上，神器也。
Softness and weakness dwell above—
These are *divine tools*.

刚强居下，利器也。
Hardness and strength dwell below—
These are *sharp tools*.

圣人处於柔弱，不以利器动乎心，故以柔胜刚，以弱胜强。
The sage dwells in softness and weakness,
Does not use *sharp tools* to move the heart,
Thus he overcomes hardness with softness,
And strength with weakness.

胡不知鱼在水中，水在鱼中，人在道中，道在人中，
How could one not know?
Fish dwell in water, yet water dwells in fish,
Man dwells in the Dao, yet the Dao dwells in man,

鱼脱於渊丧乎躯矣，利器示人丧乎道矣。
Fish removed from the depths lose their bodies,
*Sharp tools* displayed to others lose the Dao.

**道常无为，章第三十七**
**The Dao is Ever Non-Action—Chapter Thirty-Seven**

道常无为而无不为，侯王若能守，万物将自化。
The Dao is ever non-action yet nothing is left undone,
If lords and kings could guard it,
All things would spontaneously transform.

化而欲作，吾将镇以无名之朴。
If transformation is sought yet action is desired,
I would govern it with the *nameless simplicity*.

无名之朴，亦将不欲。
The *nameless simplicity* would also not desire.

不欲以静，天下将自正。
Without desire, it would remain still,
The world would spontaneously align itself.

常然之道，无为也。
The constant Dao is non-action.

天地之道，无为而无不为也。
The Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is non-action yet nothing is left undone.

然天地法道，为出於无为，故曰道常无为而无不为。
Yet Heaven and Earth follow the Dao,
Their action arises from non-action,
Thus it is said: *The Dao is ever non-action yet nothing is left undone*.

侯王法天地，若能守道以御世，则万物化之，
Lords and kings follow Heaven and Earth,
If they could guard the Dao to govern the world,
Then all things would transform of themselves,

若性之自为而不知为之者，故曰侯王若能守，万物将自化。
As if by their own nature they would act without knowing why—
Thus it is said: *If lords and kings could guard the Dao, all things would spontaneously transform*.

夫化而欲作者，将有为而起之也，
Now, if transformation is sought yet action is desired,
It would be to create action through action,

圣人於是镇之以无名之朴，
The sage would govern this with the *nameless simplicity*,
使复於无为。
To return it to non-action.

「The *nameless simplicity* is the Dao of Heaven and Earth.
All things follow their transformation—who dares to desire anything?
Thus it is also said: *It does not desire*.
Its *not desiring* is merely *stillness*.
Stillness and non-action bring about the self-regulation of the world.

*Virtue/Power* is both high and low, yet spoken of in two ways.
From *ren* downward, it speaks only of the high—
the low is already beneath consideration.

As for *wisdom* as *foreknowledge*,
it is not even mentioned in its higher form—
thus it is even more inferior to *li*.

Exhausting thought and straining the mind,
grinding and sharpening it—
hence it is called *the adornment of the Dao*.
Wearying the heart and laboring the spirit,
to lose one’s natural purity—
hence it is called *the beginning of folly*.

Not speaking of *li* while speaking of *wisdom* is already disorderly in *virtue/Power*,
and *wisdom* contradicts the Dao.
Thus the true man dwells in the substance of *virtue/Power*,
not in its shallow adornment;
he abides in the reality of the Dao,
not in the embellishment of *wisdom*.
Hence he discards that which is the adornment of the human Dao,
and takes this which is the substance of the Dao of Immortality.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: *The Ancient Attainment of the One***

The ancient attainment of the One—
Heaven attains the One and becomes clear,
Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil,
The spirit attains the One and becomes responsive,
The grain attains the One and becomes full,
All things attain the One and become alive,
Lords and kings attain the One to establish order for the world.

If the One were lost—
Heaven would fear collapse without its clarity,
Earth would fear upheaval without its tranquility,
The spirit would fear stagnation without its responsiveness,
The grain would fear depletion without its fullness,
All things would fear extinction without their aliveness,
And lords and kings would fear ruin without their order—
thus the noble would be high, yet the humble would be its root,
the elevated would be low, yet the base would be its foundation.

Hence lords and kings call themselves *lonely* and *widowed*—
this is their way of making the humble the root, is it not?
Is it not so?

Thus, the attainment of the One is achieved without *wuyu* (vehicle),
not desiring to be smooth and lustrous like jade,
nor to be rough and solid like stone.

The One is the Dao.
Before form, it is the origin of all—
indistinct and uncarved from ancient times—
then things attain it.

Heaven is firm and opened above,
using non-action as its function,
thus it attains the Dao and becomes clear.

Earth is settled and rests below,
using stillness as its nature,
thus it attains the Dao and becomes tranquil.

The spirit is hidden in the profound,
unfathomable by yin and yang,
thus it attains the Dao and becomes responsive.

The grain is empty yet conforms to Heaven’s Dao—
since Heaven attains the Dao and becomes clear,
the grain attains the Dao and becomes full.

Things cease yet nurture Earth’s Dao—
since Earth attains the Dao and becomes tranquil,
things attain the Dao and become alive.

The spirit unites with the body,
the sovereign of all limbs,
the spirit is the sovereign of all saints,
the sovereign of all under Heaven—
since the spirit attains the Dao and becomes responsive,
lords and kings attain the Dao to establish order for the world.

This attainment is achieved through the Dao alone.
If Heaven loses its clarity,
it will have no way to cover,
and will fear collapse.
」

Earth loses its tranquility,
and thus has no way to bear,
fearing it will erupt.

The spirit loses its responsiveness,
and thus has no way to guard,
fearing it will falter.

If Heaven loses its clarity,
then the grain loses its fullness and fears exhaustion.
If Earth loses its tranquility,
then things lose their vitality and fear annihilation.
If the spirit loses its responsiveness,
then lords and kings lose their order and fear collapse.

Yet when the lowly is embraced, its nobility is revealed;
when the humble is attached, its height is displayed—
just as hills and mountains accumulate the low to become high,
and rivers and seas gather waters to become vast.
Great ones unite the scattered to become sovereigns,
so those of noble height must not abandon their foundation.

Thus, lords and kings reside in unity within their domains,
hence they call themselves "lonely and meager,"
drawing qi from the Great Harmony,
hence they call themselves "not-grain."

With a hundred limbs, the body’s sovereign attains nobility,
with a hundred subjects, the sovereign of all under Heaven attains reverence.
Lords and kings attain these titles of noble height—
is it not because they take the lowly as their foundation?

To forge a carriage, one gathers examples from nearby.
Now, if you assemble the axle, wheels, and spokes to form a carriage,
and then count its many parts before assembling them,
it would be insufficient to attain the carriage.
Only when the axle, wheels, and spokes are combined
does the carriage earn its name as a means of conveyance;
only when the humble subjects are united
does the lord and king attain the title of noble height.

Jade is noble,
stone is lowly.
Jade emerges from stone,
so even nobility has its roots in the lowly.

Yet jade has inherent substance and thus attains nobility,
while a lord and king, though possessing one domain,
does not inherently attain nobility—
could they truly be like jade and stone?

**Chapter Forty: The Movement of the Dao Through Reversal**
Reversal is the movement of the Dao,
weakness is the function of the Dao.

All things under Heaven are born from existence,
existence is born from non-existence.

Tranquility is the Dao of Earth.
To reverse Earth’s tranquility into motion
is the yin responding to the yang,
thus it is said: *Reversal is the movement of the Dao.*

Weakness is the Dao of Heaven.
To employ Heaven’s weakness as function
is the yang responding to the yin,
thus it is said: *Weakness is the function of the Dao.*

The yang employs non-action for its function,
the yin employs existence for its substance.
When yin and yang interact in the boundless void,
things are born.

All things arise from Earth’s Dao,
thus it is said: *All things under Heaven are born from existence*—
this is the movement of the Dao through reversal.

Yet what has form cannot thrive without Heaven’s Dao,
thus it is said: *Existence is born from non-existence*—
this is the function of the Dao through weakness.

Thus the sages say:
Existence takes non-existence as its mother,
non-existence takes emptiness as its mother,
emptiness takes the Dao as its mother.

Nature is the root of the Dao.
If one can preserve and guard the Mysterious Pivot,
conforming to nature,
then from motion arises stillness,
and function returns to substance—
thus one will return to the Dao.

**Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Person Hears the Dao**
The superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it;
the mediocre person hears the Dao and holds it uncertainly;
the inferior person hears the Dao and laughs at it—
if they do not laugh, it is not the Dao.

Thus the ancient teachings say:
The Dao appears obscure when illuminated,
advances when retreating,
is level when uneven,
virtue is great when humble,
brightness is supreme when stained,
broad virtue is vast when insufficient,
established virtue is firm when seemingly lazy,
authentic simplicity is true when appearing flawed,
the greatest square has no corners,
the greatest vessel is fashioned last,
the greatest sound is inaudible,
the greatest form is shapeless,
the Dao is hidden and nameless.

Only the Dao is good at lending and completing.
The superior person, having already understood the Dao,
believes in it deeply and guards it firmly,
and upon hearing, they must act upon it with vigor.

The mediocre person seeks to advance through the Dao,
striving to succeed, yet without effort, they fail;
pondering to attain, yet without thought, they do not.
They waver between presence and absence,
and even after hearing, they retain doubts,
thus they remain uncertain between action and inaction.

The inferior person takes the Dao as level,
like a rustic ear unable to hear great sounds,
like common minds rejecting profound speech.
When they hear the Dao, they must scorn it,
thus they oppose it entirely and laugh derisively.

If the Dao is not scorned by the inferior,
how different would it be from what rustic ears hear
or what common tongues speak?
How could it truly be the Dao?

Thus the ancient teachings say:
The Dao appears obscure when illuminated—
only through constant night and day reflection,
proper meditation, and diligent practice
can it be attained.

The Dao advances when retreating—
if measured by the day, it seems insufficient,
but if measured by the year, it has surplus.
If one remains unburdened by existence and non-existence,
it may be achieved.

The Dao is level when uneven—
if one clings to the attainable forms, colors, names, and sounds,
or to the desires of the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth,
then laughter at the Dao is an error.

Yet do they not know that the Four Great Elements exist within their domains,
yet do not transcend the Dao?

Great virtue is the Dao of Heaven.
Heaven’s Dao is empty yet full,
and because it is empty,
it is like a valley.

Great brightness is the Kingly Dao.
The Kingly Dao, when worn, renews itself,
and because it is worn,
it is like a stain.

Broad virtue, spoken of in terms of Earth’s Dao,
is used without depletion yet appears incomplete,
thus it seems insufficient.

Established virtue, spoken of in terms of the Great Dao,
is built unshakably yet refined unnoticeably,
thus it seems lazy.

Because it is like a valley, like a stain,
like insufficiency, like laziness,
one doubts its true nature has changed.
Yet its essence as great virtue, as supreme brightness,
as broad virtue, as established virtue remains constant—
this is called *authentic simplicity appearing flawed.*

Why does authentic simplicity appear flawed?
Because the greatest square has no corners,
the greatest vessel is fashioned last,
the greatest sound is inaudible,
the greatest form is shapeless.

The greatest square encompasses all,
its virtue boundless—
thus it has no corners.
The greatest vessel is used for long in its Dao—
thus it is fashioned last.
The greatest sound speaks not,
yet the four seasons follow—
thus it is inaudible.

---

**Chapter 42: The Dao Gives Rise to One**

The greatest form has no substance,
Yet the world turns toward it—
Thus it is shapeless.

This is why the four great things are great.
Virtue is encompassed by the Dao,
The Dao is encompassed by Heaven.
The virtue of sages and kings aligns with the Dao of Heaven and Earth,
Yet it remains nameless—
The origin of Heaven and Earth,
Where the Dao dwells in concealment.

If one divides the four great things among the lands,
Each is but its manifest Dao,
And the names imposed upon them are forced.

The Dao is not inherently a thing to be bestowed,
Yet through Heaven, Earth, and the sages and kings,
It embodies the Dao to perfect the world—
Thus the name of bestowal arises,
And the effects of partiality take root.

Yet its completion is but natural—
Who could have a mind to coerce its fulfillment?

The Dao gives rise to One,
One gives rise to Two,
Two gives rise to Three,
Three gives rise to myriad things.

Myriad things draw upon the yin and embrace the yang,
And their harmonizing *qi* is the result of mingling.
What people abhor,
Are the solitary, the widowed, and the unfilled—
Yet the sages and kings hold them as their ideal.

Thus, some things are diminished to be increased,
And increased to be diminished.

What people are taught,
Is also my righteous teaching.
The overbearing perish without their proper end—
I shall take this as my guiding principle.

Changeable yet unified, the origin of One—
Thus it is said, *the Dao gives rise to One*.
One is the beginning of form’s transformation,
The greatest form within Heaven and Earth—
Thus it is said, *One gives rise to Two*.
Heaven and Earth establish their positions,
And humanity dwells within—
Thus the Three Powers are complete—
Thus it is said, *Two gives rise to Three*.
The light and clear ascend to become Heaven,
The heavy and turbid descend to become Earth,
The mingling and harmonizing *qi* becomes humanity—
Then Heaven and Earth contain their essence,
And myriad things are born and transformed—
Thus it is said, *Three gives rise to myriad things*.
Heaven, as yang, sternly emerges—
Then the yin ascends to meet the yang,
And things draw upon it.
Earth, as yin, vibrantly unfolds—
Then the yang descends to meet the yin,
And things embrace it.
As yin and yang rise and fall,
Their mutual interaction brings forth
The mingling and harmonizing *qi*—
Thus it is said, *myriad things draw upon the yin and embrace the yang,
And their harmonizing qi is the result of mingling*.

Within a single human body,
The likeness of Heaven and Earth is displayed—
Yin, yang, and mingling *qi* are all contained therein,
Yet there is also the most divine
Who governs it.

Just as the sages and kings align with Heaven and Earth,
Within this realm, the greatest is the solitary,
And one who draws upon the *qi* of Great Harmony is unfilled.
The people of the world oppose the divine,
Yet they reverse it and call it evil—
While the sages and kings alone take this upon themselves—
Thus it is said, *what people abhor,
Are the solitary, the widowed, and the unfilled—
Yet the sages and kings hold them as their ideal*.

The mingling and harmonizing *qi* of yin and yang permeates all things,
Naturally neither diminishing nor increasing—
Yet through Heaven and Earth’s fullness and emptiness,
And their correspondence with the seasons,
Sometimes it is diminished to be increased,
And increased to be diminished.

What people are taught,
Is also the rectitude of Heaven and Earth—
I prefer tranquility, yet the people naturally align.
This is my righteous teaching—
This is called *diminished to be increased*.
The overbearing oppose this—
Thus they do not meet their proper end—
This is called *increased to be diminished*.

The sage observes this,
And takes it as a warning—
Thus I shall use it as my guiding principle.

---

**Chapter 43: The Most Supreme Softness**

The most supreme softness in the world,
Rides across the world’s most supreme firmness.

Without any entry into the boundless,
It is known that non-action benefits greatly.
The teaching of silent speech,
The benefit of non-action—
Few in the world can attain it.

The most supreme softness is the spirit.
The most supreme firmness is form.
The true spirit aligns with the Dao,
Capable of vanishing and enduring—
Only when the spirit governs form,
Can the spirit make form soar,
And form follow in its boundless course—
Thus it is said, *the most supreme softness in the world,
Rides across the world’s most supreme firmness*.

The most supreme softness is without substance,
The most supreme firmness is without gaps.
When form governs form,
There are gaps that form can enter—
Thus the boundless without gaps cannot be entered.
When the spirit governs form,
The spirit can permeate without gaps—
Yet it also cannot be entered without attaining its own accord—
Thus it is said, *without any entry into the boundless*.

What form transforms,
Is the teaching of silent speech.
What the spirit attains,
Is the benefit of non-action.
If one can embody the Dao of Heaven and Earth,
Dwell in non-action,
And practice the teaching of silent speech,
Then one shapes form and aligns with spirit—
Form and spirit both attain perfection,
And one’s essence merges with the Dao’s truth.

The world values spoken teaching and favors action,
Thus few can attain this.

---

**Chapter 44: Names and Bodies**

Between names and bodies, which is more intimate?
Between bodies and wealth, which is more abundant?
Between gain and loss, which causes greater harm?

Thus, the more one loves excessively,
The greater the cost.
The more one hoards,
The heavier the loss.

Knowing contentment brings no shame,
Knowing restraint brings no peril—
Thus one can endure long.

The noble ponder day and night,
Worrying over good and evil,
Yet their bodies are also worn thin—
Thus the error of sacrificing body for name—
How can one see what is truly intimate,
When it lies in the body, not in the name?

The wealthy exhaust their bodies with labor,
Amassing wealth yet unable to use it all—
Their bodies are also strained externally—
Thus the error of sacrificing body for profit—
How can one see what is truly abundant,
When it lies in the body, not in wealth?

Yet honor and disgrace are established,
And one sees what causes harm—
Wealth and goods are gathered,
And one sees what is contested—
Those who value the manifest as true,
Know that names are the source of honor—
Those who value riches as true,
Know that wealth is the source of profit—
Thus they see gain and forget their bodies,
See profit and forget their true nature.

Then, between gain and loss,
Which truly causes greater harm?

What is lost,
Is the nameless simplicity,
The unadorned frame—
No greater harm exists than this.

Thus, to love names excessively while unaware of restraint,
The greater loss will surely be incurred.
The greater refers to the Dao’s ideal—
The nameless simplicity itself.

To hoard wealth while unaware of contentment,
The heavier loss will surely be incurred.
The heavier refers to virtue’s substance—
The unadorned frame itself.

Only the sage embodies the broad virtue,
Knows contentment without valuing wealth as noble—
Thus they suffer no shame.

The sage embodies the broad virtue’s knowing restraint,
Yet does not exalt their name—
Thus they face no peril.

If such is their way, they endure eternally,
And stand equal with Heaven and Earth.

**Chapter 45: The Great Fullness as if Deficient**
The great fullness seems deficient—
Its use is inexhaustible.
The great excess seems empty—
Its use is boundless.
The most straight seems bent,
The most skillful seems clumsy,
The most eloquent seems tongue-tied.

Agitation overcomes cold,
Stillness overcomes heat,
And serene stillness is the norm for all under Heaven.

The great fullness is Earth’s virtue—
Broad virtue seems insufficient,
Thus though complete, it seems deficient.
The great excess is Heaven’s virtue—
High virtue does not revel in itself,
Thus though full, it seems hollow.

If completion is like a mountain,
Its accumulation will crumble—
Not true great fullness.
The great fullness seems deficient,
Never crumbling—
Thus its use is inexhaustible.

If excess is like piled water,
Its flow will dry up—
Not true great excess.
The great excess seems hollow,
Never drying up—
Thus its use is boundless.

These two are Heaven and Earth’s functions—
Yin and Yang.

Heaven can generate without ceasing,
Yet its generative use is boundless.
Earth can transform without ceasing,
Yet its transformative use is inexhaustible—
Thus the Dao acts truly within them.

Only the unified is threefold,
Hence by observing Heaven and Earth, the Dao may be known.
If divided, then:
The most straight seems bent—
This is Earth’s Way.
Earth’s Way is straight yet restrained,
Thus it seems clumsy.

The most skillful seems clumsy—
This is the Constant Way,
The Constant Way carves myriad forms yet does not vie for skill,
Thus it seems clumsy.

The most eloquent seems tongue-tied—
This is Heaven’s Way.
Heaven’s Way speaks not yet responds well,
Thus it seems tongue-tied.

Yet considering their essence,
Though Heaven and Earth are vast,
They do not depart from Yin and Yang,
And one Yin, one Yang—
This is the Dao.
Thus accumulated Yang is Heaven,
Accumulated Yin is Earth.
Yin is still, Yang is restless,
Yang is hot, Yin is cold.
What governs Yin is Yang,
Thus agitation overcomes cold.
What governs Yang is Yin,
Thus stillness overcomes heat.

Yet cold departs and heat arrives,
Heat departs and cold returns—
How could their use ever be exhausted or worn out?

The Dao has clarity and turbidity,
Movement and stillness.
Clarity is the source of turbidity,
Stillness is the foundation of movement.
If one can always remain serene and still,
Heaven and Earth will all submit—
What of things?
What of affairs?
Thus it is said: Serene stillness is the norm for all under Heaven.

**Chapter 46: When the World Has the Dao**
When the world has the Dao,
Warhorses are turned to manure.
When the world lacks the Dao,
Warhorses breed in the suburbs.

No guilt is greater than desiring what is desirable,
No calamity is greater than not knowing contentment,
No blame is greater than coveting gain.
Thus, true contentment is ever content.

Those who govern the world with the Dao
Always keep the people ignorant and desireless,
Thus each finds peace in their place and does not contend—
They merely till their fields.

In the declining ages, when the Dao cannot be revived,
They see what is desirable yet do not know contentment,
Then arises the heart of coveting gain,
And they begin to seize, plunder, and encroach,
While warhorses breed in the suburbs.

Reflecting upon oneself,
Within is one’s own world.
If the Dao is within oneself,
One rests in their measure,
And guards their inch of land with vigor.
If the Dao is lost within oneself,
One gallops and hunts recklessly,
And the heart runs wild—
Already, the inch of land is lost.

Thus no guilt is greater than desiring what is desirable,
No calamity is greater than not knowing contentment,
No blame is greater than coveting gain—
All stem from failing to rest in one’s measure.

When this is carried to excess,
Contention and plunder follow.
If one can return to the measure of life and nature,
And restrain one’s intentions and desires,
Cold and calm in self-cultivation,
Then sufficiency is found within oneself—
What lack could there be?
This is how true contentment is ever content.

**Chapter 47: Not Leaving the Door**
Not leaving the door,
Yet knowing the world;
Not peering through the window,
Yet seeing the Dao.
The farther one goes,
The less one knows.

Thus the sage acts not yet knows,
Sees not yet names,
Does not act yet achieves.

The world is the nine regions, mountains, rivers, seas—
Teeming with ceaseless life.
The Dao is the four seasons, Yin and Yang, winds and rains—
Endless transformation.

Reflecting upon oneself,
Nothing is not perfectly formed.
Thus the sage says:
“I share with Heaven and Earth one breath and govern together.”
If one understands this,
One need not leave the door or peer through the window
To see and know Heaven and Earth’s Dao.

If one seeks the Dao beyond oneself,
The farther one goes, the less one knows—
How could one know that within one’s own body,
Ten thousand principles are fully present?
Nearly taking from this,
Nothing is lacking.

Thus the sage embodies Earth’s Way,
With emptiness as body,
Hence acts not yet knows—
No need to leave the door.
Embodies Heaven’s Way,
With non-action as heart,
Hence sees not yet names—
No need to peer through the window.
Embodies the Great Dao,
With naturalness as constant,
Hence does not act yet achieves—
No need to exert wisdom or strength in what is seen or done.

**Chapter 48: Learning and the Dao**
Learning increases daily,
The Dao decreases daily.
Decrease again, decrease—
Until non-action,
Yet nothing remains undone.

Thus to take the world,
One must act with non-interference.
When action arises,
It is insufficient to take the world.

The scholar seeks to exhaust principles,
Thus daily increase.
The Daoist seeks to fulfill nature,
Thus daily decrease.
Decrease again, decrease—
Until fulfilling nature to its end—
This is returning to one’s original command.

Principles have an end,
Nature has its fulfillment,
Yet still not free from action—
Hence the terms learning and Dao.
Only when command is fulfilled
Does one return to stillness—
Stillness is called returning to command,
Until non-action.

Non-action is the time of perfect stillness,
Yet when moved, it responds and harmonizes with all under Heaven—
Thus non-action yet nothing remains undone.

The Sage and the Way of Non-Action

When there is something to do,
One cannot avoid burdening the world.
When there is nothing to do,
One cannot avoid severing oneself from the world.

How does the Sage act in the world?
He simply abides in non-action.
Abiding in non-action,
Only then can one take the world—
Thus, those who take the world always act with non-interference.

Yet the world is a divine vessel,
Unfathomable and beyond doing.
Those who act ruin it,
Those who grasp lose it.
When matters arise,
It is still insufficient to take the world.

Knowing the world cannot be taken by action,
One must instead learn what is not to be learned,
To reach the Dao of non-action.

**Chapter 49: The Sage Has No Constant Heart**
The Sage has no constant heart,
Taking the hearts of the people as his own.
The virtuous, I treat as virtuous;
The unvirtuous, I also treat as virtuous—virtue of virtue.
The trustworthy, I trust;
The untrustworthy, I also trust—virtue of trust.

The Sage in the world,
With a blurred and indistinct heart for the people,
The people all fix their ears and eyes upon him,
And the Sage treats them all as children.

The Sage seeks to return to the origin,
To revert to the unborn—
Thus, he has no constant heart.

Virtue and vice, truth and deceit—
These are what people do.
I have no fixed heart within them,
Only following the hearts of the people as my own.

When the people do good, I do not know it;
When the people do evil, I do not know it.
Accumulated virtue brings virtuous *qi* near—
I do not know it as virtue, so the virtuous, I treat as virtuous.
Accumulated vice brings malevolent *qi* near—
I do not know it as unvirtue, so the unvirtuous, I also treat as virtuous.
Trust and distrust are the same.

I entrust it to nature,
With no falsehood between us—
This is called virtue of virtue, virtue of trust.

Thus, aligning virtue and vice,
Unifying truth and deceit,
My heart has no partial attachments,
Hence blurred and indistinct for the world.

The people always have hearts,
Chasing the pleasures of sound and color,
Thus all fix their ears and eyes,
Unknowing of returning their gaze inward,
Guarding the Mother’s Dao.

Only the Sage always has no heart,
Embracing the world’s origin,
Returning to guard the world’s Mother—
Thus, he treats them all as children.

**Chapter 50: Birth and Death**
Birth and death—
Those who live, thirteen in number,
Those who die, thirteen in number,
And those who move from life to death’s domain,
Also thirteen in number.

Why is this?
Because of the excess of life’s vitality.

**Chapter 50: Birth and Death (continued)**

「Indeed, those who skillfully nurture life—
On land, they meet no rhinoceros or tiger,
Within armies, they are not struck by weapons.
The rhinoceros finds no place to thrust its horn,
The tiger finds no place to strike its claws,
Weapons find no place to lodge their blades.
Why is this?
Because they dwell in a realm where death has no hold.

All things arise from the interplay of Heaven and Earth—this is called *birth*,
And return to the transformations of yin and yang—this is called *death*.
Those who follow birth and death as companions,
Have not escaped the interplay of Heaven and Earth,
Nor have they avoided the transformations of yin and yang.
Yet, when all things move through birth and death,
It is said that only *human* life is driven to death’s domain—why?
This is all by the people’s own doing,
Not Heaven and Earth’s destruction,
Nor the harm of spirits and gods—
Because they possess *knowing* and their forms are restless.

The eyes see life’s approach and cannot repel it,
Death’s departure and cannot halt it—why?
Because life’s vitality is excessive,
And they are driven to death’s domain.

Only the Sage cherishes the subtle and profound,
Embraces the pure and unadorned,
And dares not contend with the world in action.
Though fierce beasts exist, they cannot seize him,
Though weapons strike, they cannot harm him.
His accumulated virtue is deeply resonant,
No thing can wound him—
Thus, he dwells in a realm where death has no hold.

**Chapter 51: The Dao Nurtures Life**
The Dao *nurtures* life,
Virtue *nurtures* it,
Things take their form,
Circumstances bring them to fruition.
Thus, all things revere the Dao and honor virtue.
The Dao’s reverence,
Virtue’s honor—
No titles bestow them, yet they endure naturally.

Hence, the Dao *nurtures*, *nurtures* it,
*Lengthens*, *cultivates* it,
*Completes*, *ripening* it,
*Nourishes*, *protecting* it.
It gives birth without possession,
Acts without reliance,
Lengthens without domination—
This is called the *profound virtue*.

From whence does the Dao nurture life?
It *nurtures* the harmonious *true qi* of Heaven and Earth,
And all things arise from it—
This is how the Dao nurtures life,
Hence it is said: *The Dao nurtures life, virtue nurtures it*.

From whence do things take form?
Following the ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth,
And the grasp of yin and yang—
All things are formed from it—
This is how things take form,
Hence it is said: *Things take their form, circumstances bring them to fruition*.

Because the Dao can nurture,
All things bow to it—
This is called *revering the Dao*.
Because virtue can *nurture*,
All things cannot *demean* it—
This is called *honoring virtue*.

Only the Dao and virtue reside in the accumulation of yang,
Not seeking reverence or honor from things—
Things themselves revere and honor them,
For from ancient times to the present,
No titles bestow them, yet they endure naturally.

Hence, the Dao *nurtures*, *nurtures* it,
*Lengthens*, *cultivates* it,
*Completes*, *ripening* it,
*Nourishes*, *protecting* it—
This is the Dao operating between Heaven and Earth,
And enduring naturally.

If one *nurtures* life without possession,
Acts without reliance,
Lengthens without domination,
Then it aligns with the harmony of Heaven and Earth—
This is called the *profound virtue*.

**Chapter 52: The Origin of the World**
The world has an origin,
Which we call the *Mother of the world*.
Having obtained its Mother,
We come to know her children,
Having known her children,
We return to guard its Mother—
And thus, our life remains unharmed.

Seal its *mouth* (兑),
Close its *gate* (门),
And we toil not our whole lives.
Open its *mouth*,
Advance its *affairs*,
And we are never saved our whole lives.

Seeing the small as *illumination*,
Guarding the soft as *strength*—
Using its *radiance*,
And returning to its *illumination*,
We suffer no calamity—
This is called *following the constant*.

First, there is the unity of Heaven and Earth,
And then the world has an origin—
Thus, it is called the *Mother of the world*.
Having obtained Heaven and Earth,
As the *Mother of the world*,
We know that all things are her children.

Having known her children,
And returning to guard the Mother’s Dao,
Then her children are whole.
Indeed, people only know Heaven and Earth and all things,
Yet do not know their own source of birth.
If one knows this,
And returns to guard the Dao of Heaven and Earth,
Then one’s life remains unharmed.

Thus, those who embody the Dao of Heaven and Earth,
Engage in *non-action*,
Follow the *teaching of silence*—
Hence it is said: *Seal its mouth, close its gate,*
*And we toil not our whole lives*.

Those who do not know the Dao,
Speak much and act—
Following affairs and losing the Mother’s Dao,
Hence it is said: *Open its mouth, advance its affairs,*
*And we are never saved our whole lives*.

The small is the *unadorned* of Heaven and Earth,
The soft is the *profound application* of the Dao—
Only by self-knowing do we see the Dao of Heaven and Earth,
Hence it is said: *illumination*.
Only by self-mastering do we guard the Dao’s subtlety,
Hence it is said: *strength*.

*Illumination* is the union of yin and yang in speech,
*Radiance* emerges from *illumination*—
Using *non-action*,
Within oneself, it becomes wisdom and intent.
The Sage discards wisdom and intent,
Not forcing but illuminating the Dao of Heaven—
Thus, he uses its *radiance*,
And returns to its *illumination*.

*Radiance* wasted outward is called *suffering calamity*,
Not wasting *radiance* and returning to *illumination*—
This is called *following the constant*.

Only thus can one guard the Mother’s Dao.

**Chapter 53: Let Me Explain Clearly**
If I were to explain clearly,
And walk the *Great Dao*,
I would only fear *excessive action*.

The *Great Dao* is most smooth,
Yet people love shortcuts.
Morning is neglected,
Fields grow overgrown,
Granaries are emptied,
Garments adorned with fine colors,
Belts bearing sharp blades,
Sated with delicacies,
Wealth overflowing—
This is called *robber’s pride*,
Not the Dao, is it?

The streams of mountain paths,
If used excessively, become thoroughfares,
If not used, are choked with weeds.
The people of the world do not know the *Great Dao’s* subtlety,
Yet engage in excessive action—
This is how they block their own hearts.

The stirring of *nature* is called *action*,
The artificiality of *action* is called *loss*—
Thus, those who know fear and do not dare act.

The *Great Dao* is most smooth,
Yet when viewed, it is unseen—
The heart desires swiftness,
Thus, people love shortcuts and forever stray from the *Great Dao*.

Moreover, the heart is the sovereign’s *minister*—
If the heart is restless,
Then even a single *inch of field* is lost,
And if a single *inch of field* is lost,
Then the harmonious *qi* does not descend,
And if the harmonious *qi* does not descend,
Then the *Great Granary* is emptied—
Hence it is said: *Morning is neglected, fields grow overgrown,*
*The granaries are emptied*.

Because of this,
There are distinctions in rank,
There are contests of seizing,
There is the enjoyment of the five flavors—
Thus, fine garments and adornments,
Belts bearing sharp blades,
Sated with delicacies—
And if wealth overflows,
Then all its harms are gathered at their root.»

This is called the labor of plundering the *Dao* and the body,
Yet those who do not know still boast of their own talents and abilities without ceasing—
How can this be called *stealing* and *boasting*? It is not the *Way*!

**Chapter Fifty-Four: The Unshaken Foundation**

One who builds well does not topple,
One who embraces well does not slip—
Thus, descendants continue sacrifices without ceasing.

When cultivated in the self, its *virtue* becomes true,
When cultivated in the family, its *virtue* overflows,
When cultivated in the village, its *virtue* endures,
When cultivated in the state, its *virtue* flourishes,
When cultivated in the world, its *virtue* becomes universal.

Thus, one observes the self through the self,
The family through the family,
The village through the village,
The state through the state,
The world through the world.

How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

*Building* refers to the origin of creation and action.
Only the *Dao* builds *virtue* and distinguishes,
Establishing Heaven and Earth—
Their grandeur unshaken—
This is when *One Qi* divides into the Two Principles.

*Embracing* refers to holding fast without separation.
Only *virtue* embraces the *Dao* to give birth,
Nurturing all things—
Their continuity unbroken—
This is when *One Qi* disperses into myriad forms.

All things share in *One Qi*,
Yet humanity is the most refined—
Thus, it becomes the progenitor of all things,
The root of Heaven and Earth.

If one establishes the central *One* and embraces unity for the world,
Then blessings descend upon future descendants,
And all within the Four Seas come with their duties to offer sacrifices without ceasing.

This *Way*—
I trace its origin,
For it stems from cultivating the self.

Once the *Way*’s truth is realized through self-cultivation,
Then its remnants extend to the state,
And its essence spreads to the world.

From one body to the world,
Its cultivation grows ever broader,
Its *virtue* ever more profound.

To cultivate the self—
Though the spirit dwells in the body,
It first conceals itself from Heaven and Earth,
Quietly residing at the origin of all things,
Making the mind dwell nowhere in the body—
This is called cultivating the self,
And thus its *virtue* becomes true.

From this, though one is in the family,
The mind dwells nowhere in the family—
This is called cultivating the family,
And thus its *virtue* overflows.

Though one is in the village,
The mind dwells nowhere in the village—
This is called cultivating the village,
And thus its *virtue* endures.

Though one is in the state,
The mind dwells nowhere in the state—
This is called cultivating the state,
And thus its *virtue* flourishes.

Though one is in the world,
The mind dwells nowhere in the world—
This is called cultivating the world,
And thus its *virtue* becomes universal.

Thus, to observe the self through the self—
It is an inward gaze, scrutinizing one’s own *virtue*.

For the observation of a single family, village, state,
Even unto the world—
The Sage harbors no contrivance in mind,
Each observes itself naturally,
And thus it is known.

How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

**Chapter Fifty-Fifth: The Profound Virtue of the Embracing**

The profound virtue of the Embracing
Is likened to the infant.
Poisonous serpents do not sting,
Fierce beasts do not seize,
Snatching birds do not clutch.

Bones are frail, sinews supple, yet the grasp is firm;
Unknowing of male and female union, yet it rises erect—
This is the utmost of *qi*.
All day it cries, yet its throat is unstrained—
This is the utmost of harmony.

To know harmony is to know constancy—
To know constancy is to know clarity.
To take life as gain is an omen—
To move *qi* with the mind is strength.

When things grow robust, they grow old—
This is called *not* the Dao.
Not the Dao perishes early.

The infant’s nature
Is one with the Dao,
Its heavenly safeguard intact,
Its spirit unbreached—
Thus the Sage does not lose the infant’s heart,
And the profound virtue of the Embracing
May be likened to the infant.

If such is the case,
Accumulating *virtue* in mysterious passage,
Hidden in Heaven, none can harm it—
Thus poisonous serpents do not sting,
Fierce beasts do not seize,
Snatching birds do not clutch.

Bones frail, sinews supple, yet the grasp is firm—
This is *virtue* complete in the Earthly Way.
The Earth’s *qi* begins at *zi* (the hour of birth),
The infant’s frail bones and supple sinews yet firm grasp—
This is the pure *qi*’s safeguard responding to the Earthly Way.

Unknowing of male and female union yet rising erect—
This is the utmost of *qi*—
This is *virtue* complete in the Constant Way.
The Constant Way’s *qi* is most true,
The infant, unknowing of male and female union, yet sometimes rising—
This is the Dao’s true *qi* responding in humanity.

All day it cries, yet its throat is unstrained—
This is the utmost of harmony—
This is *virtue* complete in the Heavenly Way.
Heaven governs sound,
Its yin-yang *qi* harmonized yet undivided—
Thus it cries all day, yet its throat is unstrained.

To know harmony—
Yin and yang blend as one—
Thus it is called constancy.
To know constancy—
Yin and yang merge yet remain undivided—
Thus it is called clarity.

The infant’s nature aligns with Heaven and Earth,
Its *virtue* does not take life as gain.
To reverse and take life as gain—
This is the sign of entering the death-ground—
This is called an omen.
Once life is taken as gain,
Then *qi* must be moved by the mind—
This is the way of the strong.

Beginning with taking life as gain,
Ending with things growing robust then old—
This is called *not* the Dao.
Not the Dao perishes early.

**Chapter Fifty-Six: The Wise Do Not Speak**

The wise do not speak,
Those who speak are not wise.

「塞其兑，闭其门，
*Plug its mouth*, seal its gate—
挫其锐，解其纷，
*Dull its sharpness*, disperse its tumult—
和其光，同其尘，
*Blend its radiance*, align with common dust—
是谓玄同。
This is called *Mysterious Unity*.

故不可得而亲，不可得而疏，
Thus it cannot be grasped as near nor distant—
不可得而利，不可得而害，
Cannot be seized for gain nor avoided for harm—
不可得而贵，不可得而贱，
Cannot be prized as noble nor debased as low—
故为天下贵。
Thus it is most honored by all under Heaven.

道要自然，
The *Dao/Way* requires *spontaneity* (zìrán)—
行者能得，
Those who practice can attain it—
闻者能言，
Those who hear can speak of it—
所以言者，以言相然。
Yet why do they speak? *Because speech can clarify* (yán) one another.

相然者，意之默识而已，
*Clarification through speech*—
This is but the silent understanding of the mind—
未尝见於譊譊之言辨也，
It does not manifest in *prolix* (yōuyōu) verbal disputation—
故曰知者不言。
Thus it is said: *The wise do not speak*.

不知道者，以言相烦，
Those who do not know the *Dao*—
They vex one another with speech—
不闻不言，不知所由然，
They neither hear nor speak,
Unknowing how it comes to be—
故曰言者不知。
Thus it is said: *Those who speak are not wise*.

唯圣人知天地之道，
Only the *Sage* knows the *Dao/Way* of Heaven and Earth—
有大美而不言，
Possessing great *virtue/power* (dàměi) yet not speaking—
故塞其兑，闭其门，
Thus *plugging its mouth*, sealing its gate—
涂邻守神而退藏於密。
*Dwelling in obscurity* (túlín) and *preserving the spirit* (shǒushén), *retiring into concealment* (tuìcáng yú mì).

及其出而为天下，
When it emerges to benefit all under Heaven—
於此体天之道，则挫其锐而和其光也，
Here it embodies the *Dao/Way* of Heaven:
*Dull its sharpness* and *blend its radiance*—
於此体地之道，则解其纷而同其尘也。
Here it embodies the *Dao/Way* of Earth:
*Disperse its tumult* and *align with common dust*.

天地之道是谓玄同，
The *Dao/Way* of Heaven and Earth is called *Mysterious Unity*—
玄有赤有黑，
*Mysterious* (xuán) holds both *red* (chì) and *black* (hēi)—
故玄同则合乎至一，
Thus *Mysterious Unity* converges with *Ultimate Oneness* (zhìyī)—
而与天地相参。
And harmonizes with the principles of Heaven and Earth.

天道无亲，
The *Dao/Way* of Heaven has no favorites—
故不可得而亲，
Thus it cannot be grasped as near—
既不可得而亲，亦不可得而疏也。
Since it cannot be grasped as near,
It also cannot be grasped as distant.

地道无欲，
The *Dao/Way* of Earth has no cravings—
故不可得而利，
Thus it cannot be seized for gain—
既不可得而利，亦不可得而害也。
Since it cannot be seized for gain,
It also cannot be avoided for harm.

大道无形，
The *Great Dao/Way* is formless—
故不可得而贵，
Thus it cannot be prized as noble—
既不可得而贵，亦不可得而贱也。
Since it cannot be prized as noble,
It also cannot be debased as low—
若是者，宜为天下贵。
If such is the case,
It should be most honored by all under Heaven.

以正治国章第五十七
**Chapter Fifty-Seven: Governing with Rectitude**

以正治国，以奇用兵，
*Governing with rectitude* (zhèng),
*Employing the strange* (qí) in warfare—
以无事取天下。
*Conquering through non-action* (wúshì) to attain all under Heaven.

吾何以知其然哉？
*How do I know this is so?*

夫天下多忌讳，
*For when all under Heaven abounds in taboos*—
而民弥贫；
The people grow ever poorer—
人多利器，
Men abound in *sharp implements* (lìqì)—
国家滋昏；
The state grows increasingly corrupt—
人多技巧，
Men abound in *crafty skills* (jìqiǎo)—
奇物滋起；
And strange artifacts proliferate—
法令滋彰，
Laws and decrees become ever more explicit—
盗贼多有。
Thieves and robbers abound.

故圣人云：
Thus the *Sage* says:
我无为而民自化，
*I act with non-doing* (wúwéi), yet the people transform themselves—
我无事而民自富，
*I take no action* (wúshì), yet the people grow wealthy—
我好静而民自正，
*I love tranquility* (hàojìng), yet the people become upright—
我无欲而民自朴。
*I have no cravings* (wúyù), yet the people return to simplicity.

闻在宥天下，不闻治天下，
*It is heard in pardoning all under Heaven*—
Not heard in governing all under Heaven—
天下不可治也，
*For all under Heaven cannot be governed*—
故以正治国者，必以奇用兵。
Thus those who govern with rectitude must employ the strange in warfare.

盖正复为奇，
*For rectitude becomes the strange*—
则有用兵之患，
Then the calamity of warfare arises—
以福兮祸所伏也，
*For blessing is the seed of calamity*—
孰知其极？
Who knows its limits?

是以圣人以无事取天下。
Thus the *Sage* conquers all under Heaven through non-action.

无事则法地而好静，
*Non-action* follows the *Dao/Way* of Earth and loves tranquility—
好静则法天而无为，
Loving tranquility follows the *Dao/Way* of Heaven and acts with non-doing—
无为则法道而无欲，
Acting with non-doing follows the *Great Dao/Way* and has no cravings—
无欲则天下自然归之。
Having no cravings, all under Heaven naturally returns to it.

吾何以知其然哉？
*How do I know this is so?*

夫治出於有为，
*For governance arises from doing*—
而失太上不言之教，
Yet losing the *Supreme* (tàishàng) *non-speech* (bùyán) teaching—
故多忌讳之禁，
Thus there are many taboo prohibitions—
则四民迁业而弥贫。
Then the four classes shift their occupations and grow ever poorer.

民贫则征求利器，
The people become poor and seek *sharp implements*—
贪污之风生，
The winds of greed and corruption arise—
故国家滋昏。
Thus the state grows increasingly corrupt.

玩好伎巧，难得之货贵，
*Delighting in luxuries and crafty skills*—
Rare treasures grow costly—
故奇物滋起。
Thus strange artifacts proliferate.

由此利害相攻，
From this, gain and harm contend—
法令滋彰，
Laws and decrees become ever more explicit—
克核太至，
Excessive severity reaches its extreme—
民不聊生，
The people barely survive—
故盗贼多有。
Thus thieves and robbers abound.

奇兵之用缘此而起，
The use of *strange forces* (qíbīng) stems from this—
此乃以正治国，正之极也。
This is indeed governing with rectitude, the extreme of rectitude.

是以圣人无事，
Thus the *Sage* acts with non-action—
则国实民富，
Then the state is strong and the people wealthy—
故忌讳不生，
Thus taboos do not arise—
好静则天下自正，
Loving tranquility, all under Heaven becomes upright—
故利器不作。
Thus *sharp implements* are not sought.

无为则万民自化，
*Non-doing* (wúwéi) lets all the people transform themselves—
伎巧何施？
*What use are crafty skills?*
无欲则民自归朴，
Having no cravings, the people return to simplicity—
盗贼何有？
*What thieves and robbers are there?*
此乃以无事取天下也。
This is indeed conquering all under Heaven through non-action.

其政闷闷章第五十八
**Chapter Fifty-Eight: The Sage’s Governance is Obscure**

其政闷闷，
Its governance is *obscure yet profound* (mènmèn)—
其民淳淳；
Its people are *simple and sincere* (chúnchún)—
其政察察，
Its governance is *explicit and scrutinizing* (cháchá)—
其民缺缺。
Its people are *cunning and deceitful* (quēquē).

祸兮福所倚，
*Calamity*—
*For calamity is the leaning of blessing*—
福兮祸所伏。
*Blessing*—
*For blessing is the seed of calamity*—
孰知其极？
Who knows its limits?
其无正邪？
*Is there no rectitude or deviation?*
正复为奇，
Rectitude becomes the strange—
善复为祆。
Blessing becomes *ill-omened* (jiāo).

民之迷，其日固久。
The people’s confusion has lasted long indeed.

是以圣人方而不割，
Thus the *Sage* is *square* (fāng) yet does not *sever* (gē)—
廉而不刿，
*Modest* (lián) yet does not *pierce* (jià)—
直而不肆，
*Upright* (zhí) yet does not *exaggerate* (shì)—
光而不耀。
*Radiant* (guāng) yet does not *blaze* (yào).

太上之世，
In the *Supreme Age* (tàishàng)—
处无为之事，
*Dwelling in non-doing*—
行不言之教，
*Practicing non-speech* teaching—
天下知有上而不知有政，
All under Heaven knows there is a *Supreme* (shàng) yet does not know there is governance—
故为政无处正，
Thus in governance, there is no need to establish rectitude—
自居之闷闷者，
*For the naturally profound* (zìjū zhī mènmèn)—
有政而不作也。
There is governance yet no action taken.

有政不作则非以明民，
Governance without action is not to enlighten the people—
将以愚之，
But to delude them—
故其民亦淳淳而若朴焉。
Thus its people are also *simple and sincere* yet appear as if in simplicity.

然既立政为正，
Yet if governance is established as rectitude—
必有以察为奇，
There must be *scrutiny as the strange*—
故始於闷闷而终於察察。
Thus it begins with *obscure yet profound* governance and ends with *explicit and scrutinizing* governance.

终於察察，政之极也。
Ending with *explicit and scrutinizing* governance is the extreme of governance.

其政太察，
If governance is too scrutinizing—
使民无所措手足，
The people have no place to set their hands and feet—
故其民缺缺焉。
Thus its people become *cunning and deceitful*.

圣人言但知求福，
The *Sage* says: *Only knowing to seek blessing*—
不知罪婴，
*Unknowing of the guilt of calamity*—
但知养身，
*Only knowing to nourish life*—
不知戮形，
*Unknowing of the punishment of form*—
祸福倚伏，
Calamity and blessing lean and hide—
理之然也，
This is the natural order—
故曰孰知其极，其无正邪？
Thus it is said: *Who knows its limits? Is there no rectitude or deviation?*

世之人以政为正，
The people of the world take governance as rectitude—
不知正之极而奇生，
*Unknowing that rectitude’s extreme gives rise to the strange*—
以福为善，
Taking blessing as good—
不知善之复而妖起，
*Unknowing that good’s reversal spawns the strange*—
迷迷相传，
Confusion is passed on in confusion—
于今久矣。
For ages now.

是以圣人方如广德之厚，
Thus the *Sage* is *square* (fāng) like the *great virtue/power* (guǎngdé) of *thickness*—
故不割也；
Thus does not *sever*—
廉如上德之清，
*Modest* (lián) like the *Supreme virtue/power* (shàngdé) of *clarity*—
故不刿也。
Thus does not *pierce*.

直而不申於外，
*Upright* (zhí) yet not *exaggerated* (shēn) outward—
光而返照於内，
*Radiant* (guāng) yet reflecting inward—
无正可处，
No rectitude can be fixed—
无奇可察，
No *strange* (qí) can be scrutinized—
是谓无极之道。
This is called the *Dao/Way of No Extremes*.

治人事天章第五十九
**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Governing People and Serving Heaven**

治人事天莫若啬，
*Nothing surpasses frugality* (sè) in governing people and serving Heaven—
夫唯啬，
*For only frugality*—
是谓早复。
Is called *early return*.

早复谓之重积德，
*Early return* is called *repeatedly accumulating virtue/power* (chóngjīdé)—
重积德则无不克，
Repeatedly accumulating virtue/power means nothing is unconquered—
无不克则莫知其极。
Nothing unconquered means no one knows its limits.

莫知其极，
No one knows its limits—
可以有国。
Thus one can have a state.

有国之母，
*The foundation of having a state*—
可以长久，
Can endure long—
是谓深根固蒂，
This is called the *Dao/Way of deep roots and firm stems* (shēngén gùdì)—
长生久视之道。
The *Dao/Way* of longevity and lasting vision.

---

**Frugality (Sè) as Gathering and Nurturing—Returning to Virtue/Power (Dé)**

Frugality (sè) is *gathering* (liǎn) and *nurturing* (xù).
To speak externally, it is *gathering*;
To speak internally, it is *nurturing*.
When gathering externally, one reaches *no desire* (wùyù),
Thus one retreats from the body, abandons the body—
This is how one governs people.

When nurturing internally, one reaches *no knowing* (wùzhī),
Thus one preserves the heart, nourishes the nature—
This is how one serves Heaven.

Externally, with no desire, one follows the Earth’s stillness
And thus fulfills one’s nature.
Internally, with no knowing, one embodies Heaven’s function
And attains *return to the primal command* (fùmìng).

To fulfill one’s nature and attain *return to the primal command*
Is to *retain one’s primal source* (fǔmǔ),
Thus it is called *early return* (zǎofù).

*Early* refers to the sun’s ascent at the beginning of Jia-Yang.
To retain one’s primal source
Is to harmonize with Heaven and Earth in virtue/power (dé),
This is called *repeatedly accumulating virtue/power* (chóngjīdé).

Accumulating virtue/power in profound unity,
Merging with the Dao in its truth,
Thus nothing is unconquered.

Merging with the Dao in its truth—
Difficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom,
Thus no one knows its limits.

Difficult to exhaust, yet when weak, all principles are complete—
Thus one can have a state.

*The foundation of having a state* (yǒuguó zhī mǔ)
Is this: neither square nor round,
Parallel with Heaven and Earth—
Thus it can endure long.

Thus to retain the source (mǔ)
Is to *deeply root* (shēn gēn),
To *firmly stem* (gùdì) in *return to the primal command* (fùmìng).
To obtain Heaven and Earth as constants
And the Five Phases not clashing,
To merge with the Great Dao as one
And the Three Lights without obscurity—
This is called the *Dao/Way of longevity and lasting vision* (chángshēng jiǔshì zhī dào).

---
**Chapter Sixty: Governing Great States**

To govern a great state, treat it like cooking a small fish.
To rule the world with the Dao,
Its spirits are not numinous.

Not that its spirits are not numinous—
But its numinous does not harm the people;
Not that its numinous does not harm the people—
The Sage also does not harm the people.

When both do not harm each other,
Virtue/power (dé) returns and exchanges.

The Dao of governance values stillness and quietude—
The people then regulate themselves.
Do not act artificially—
Thus, to govern a great state is like cooking a small fish.

Speaking of people,
A great state is the central realm of Yellow Emperor’s land—
And this is how it is governed.

Thus the Sage dwells in *non-action* (wúwéi),
With a single mind steadfast—
And rules the world.
Hence, spirits have no place to manifest their numinous resonance,
Depending on humans to act—
What numinous power could there be?

Not that its spirits are not numinous—
For it does not receive evil,
And evil qi departs on its own—
Thus the numinous does not harm people.

Not that its numinous does not harm people—
For the Sage dwells in *non-action*,
And the world transforms naturally.
Thus, externally, there are no calamities of contention, robbery, or war;
Internally, there are no schemes of murder or grudges.
Not transgressing the spirits’ retribution—
Thus the Sage also does not harm people.

When humans and spirits both do not harm each other,
The spirits bestow blessings—
Granting you abundant fortune and returning virtue/power to the spirits.
The people are sincere—
Daily nourished with food and drink,
And virtue/power returns to humans.

Virtue/power returns to the spirits,
Thus descendants continue sacrifices without ceasing.
Virtue/power returns to humans,
Thus the world joyfully promotes it without tiring.

This is the effect of the Sage ruling the world with the Dao.

---
**Chapter Sixty-One: Great States as the Lowly Flow**

A great state is the lowly flow,
The convergence of the world,
The world’s *yin*—
For *yin* always overcomes *yang* through stillness,
And stillness is *lowly*.

Thus, when a great state is lowly to a small state, it takes the small state;
When a small state is lowly to a great state, it takes the great state.
Thus, sometimes lowly to take,
Sometimes lowly and taken.

A great state seeks only to *nurture all* (jiānrú rén);
A small state seeks only to *enter and serve* (rùshì rén).
Both obtain what they desire—
Thus the great should properly be lowly.

Water excels in being lowly—
Thus rivers and seas become kings of all valleys.
A great state desires to *nurture all*—
Also through its lowly flow alone.
Thus it is said: *A great state is the lowly flow.*

The world converges, all things are born;
Human paths converge, achievements are completed—
This is called the world’s convergence.
Yet it must first dwell in gentleness and stillness—
For *yin* always overcomes *yang* through stillness,
And *yang* submits to it—
Thus stillness is lowly.

Stillness means no affairs—
Only through no affairs can one take the world,
Much less a state.
Thus, when a great state is lowly to a small state, it takes the small state;
When a small state is lowly to a great state, it takes the great state.

Sometimes lowly to take—this is the *Way of the Sovereign*.
Sometimes lowly and taken—this is the *Way of the Minister*.

The Sovereign is like Heaven—
Heaven’s *Way* is lowly yet nourishing, bright and clear,
Thus a great state seeks only to *nurture all*.
The Minister is like Earth—
Earth’s *Way* is lowly yet ascending,
Thus a small state seeks only to *enter and serve*.

When Heaven and Earth converge, all things are born;
When human paths converge, achievements are completed—
Both obtain what they desire.
Yet only the great should properly be lowly—
Thus it is again said: *The great should be lowly.*

---
**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao as the Mystery of All Things**

The Dao is the mystery of all things,
The treasure of the virtuous,
The refuge of the unvirtuous.
Fine words can be sold,
Noble conduct can elevate one.

If people are unvirtuous, what can be discarded?
Thus, when establishing a Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Ministers,
Even with a jade tablet and four horses offered first,
It is not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao.

Why did the ancients value this Dao so?
Was it not to *seek and obtain*?
Or to *have guilt and fear*?
Thus it is valued for the world.

The Dao is the abyss of emptiness—
People see things but do not see the Dao,
Thus the Dao is the mystery of all things.

To grasp the Dao’s subtlety is to be virtuous—
This is called the treasure of *nature and life* (xìngmìng).
To speak of the Dao falsely is unvirtuous—
Yet one still finds refuge in it.

*Market* refers to where the multitude gathers.
*Add* refers to placing oneself above the multitude.
Fine words and noble conduct—
Even the unvirtuous can gather the multitude and rise above them—
What could be discarded?

Thus, when establishing a Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Ministers,
It is to sit and discuss the Dao.

「Though one may possess a jade-like treasure to precede a team of four horses, the result is still the same: fine words and noble conduct gather the multitude and elevate one above them.

Yet even so, it is still not as good as sitting and advancing the Dao of *Non-Action* (wúwéi), attaining its subtlety, and thus achieving greater healing.

Why did the ancients hold this Dao in such esteem?
Was it not because the treasure of *nature and life* (xìngmìng) can be sought and obtained,
while the refuge of what is born is merely to escape guilt and fear?

Thus, this Dao is valued for the world.

**Chapter Sixty-Three: On *Non-Action* (wúwéi) and *Non-Affairs* (wúshì)**

To practice *Non-Action* (wúwéi),
to engage in *Non-Affairs* (wúshì),
to find contentment in *Non-Taste* (wúwèi).

Great and small, much and little—
rewarding resentment with *virtue* (dé).
Attempting the difficult through the easy,
achieving the great through the minute.

The world’s difficult tasks must begin in ease,
the world’s great affairs must arise from small beginnings.
Thus, the Sage never strives to be great,
and so can accomplish the truly great.

Light promises bring few trustworthy words,
many changes bring many difficulties.
Therefore, the Sage treats difficulty as difficulty,
and so never faces true difficulty.

The Sage embodies the *Dao of Heaven* (tiāndào) in practicing *Non-Spoken Teaching* (bùyánzhījiào),
thus attaining *Non-Action* (wúwéi);
embodies the *Constant Dao* (chángdào) in handling *Non-Affairs* (wúwéishì),
thus achieving *Non-Affairs* (wúshì);
embodies the *Dao of Earth* (dìdào) in delighting in the *power of tranquility* (tiándànzhīnéng),
thus finding contentment in *Non-Taste* (wúwèi).

From the perspective of what is appropriate,
it seems there is *Action* (yǒuwéi), *Affairs* (yǒushì), and *Taste* (yǒuwèi).
From the perspective of what is upheld,
then *Non-Action* (wúwéi) is *Action* (yǒuwéi),
*Non-Affairs* (wúshì) is *Affairs* (yǒushì),
and *Non-Taste* (wúwèi) is merely *Taste* (yǒuwèi).

The people of the world do not understand this,
so they act boldly and incur resentment,
pursue the small and reach the great,
accumulate the few and attain the many—
all driven by their fixation on deeds and desires.

Yet greatness and smallness, abundance and scarcity,
follow their kind and are repaid,
all arising from their own gains—
Heaven and Earth respond like echoes.
Thus it is said: *Reward resentment with virtue* (dé).

From this perspective,
the world’s difficult tasks arise from ease and become difficult,
the world’s great affairs arise from small beginnings and become great—
thus, calamities emerge from the unheeded,
disasters from the minutely overlooked.
Is this not what is meant?

Therefore, the Sage aligns with Heaven as Heaven,
so he never strives to be great;
unites with the Dao as one,
so he can accomplish the truly great.

As for those who make light promises and pursue many changes,
they harm themselves by acting lightly in *Action* (yǒuwéi),
thus they lack trustworthiness and face many difficulties.

The Sage practices *Non-Spoken Teaching* (bùyánzhījiào),
so he has no need for trustworthy words;
handles *Non-Affairs* (wúwéishì) and delights in the *power of tranquility* (tiándànzhīnéng),
so he avoids the blame of many difficulties;
leaves things to their natural course without daring to act,
so he never faces true difficulty.

**Chapter Sixty-Four: On the Ease of Holding What Is Tranquil**

Its tranquility is easy to hold,
its unmanifested state is easy to plan,
its fragility is easy to float away,
its subtlety is easy to disperse.

Prevent failure before it arises,
prevent disorder before it begins.

A tree thick enough to embrace grows from a tiny sprout;
a nine-tiered tower rises from a pile of earth;
a journey of a thousand *li* begins beneath one’s feet.

The doer brings failure,
the grasper brings loss.
Thus, the Sage practices *Non-Action* (wúwéi) and so knows no failure,
holds nothing and so knows no loss.

The people’s undertakings often fail just as completion nears,
but if they guard the end as they did the beginning,
then there will be no failed affairs.

Thus, the Sage desires what others do not desire,
values not the treasures that are hard to obtain;
learns what others do not learn,
restores the errors of the multitude,
assists the natural course of all things,
and dares not act.

Tranquility remains unspoiled before its emergence,
easy to plan and hold—
this is called *preventing failure before it arises*.

Fragility and subtlety have already taken form,
easy to disperse and dissolve—
this is called *preventing disorder before it begins*.

Yet, to prevent failure before it arises,
can one truly avoid all thought and deliberation?
To prevent disorder before it begins,
can one truly avoid all wisdom and strategy?

Thus, the Sage says:
Deliberation and thought are the origins of peril,
and peril will not last long.
Better to be cautious at the outset of affairs,
forgetting the need to act,
and cautious at the beginning of undertakings,
forgetting the need to govern—
this is the greater remedy.

For greatness arises from smallness,
height from lowliness,
distance from proximity—
this is the natural order.

The doer brings failure,
the grasper brings loss.
Only the Sage sees the beginning and contemplates the end,
discerns the intention and knows the conclusion—
thus he practices *Non-Action* (wúwéi),
and so knows no failure;
holds nothing,
and so knows no loss.

As for the people’s undertakings,
they cannot escape *Action* (yǒuwéi) and governance,
yet they do not know to be cautious.
Their desires grow ever longer,
and when the true harmony is exhausted,
they fail just as completion nears—
how could this not be so?

If one guards the end as the beginning,
and returns to the *Dao of the Infant Guarded by Its Mother* (yīng’érshǒumǔ),
then there will be no failed affairs.

Thus, the Sage desires what others do not desire,
externally does nothing—
even treasures that are hard to obtain are not valued;
learns what others do not learn,
internally does nothing—
even fine words and noble conduct are not esteemed,
restoring the errors of the multitude’s governance,
assisting the natural course of all things,
and daring not to act.

**Chapter Sixty-Five: On the Ancients’ Skill in Advancing the Dao**

The ancients who skillfully advanced the Dao
did not seek to enlighten the people,
but rather to rely upon them.

The people are difficult to govern
because their wisdom is excessive.
Thus, governing with wisdom is the ruin of the state;
not governing with wisdom is the state’s blessing.

Knowing these two principles is the *model of conduct* (kǎishì).
Always knowing the *model of conduct* (kǎishì)
is called *Mysterious Virtue* (xuándé).

*Mysterious Virtue* (xuándé) is profound and distant,
contrary to things and yet only then does it reach great harmony.

The Dao of *Non-Action* (wúwéi) brings self-possession within,
the Dao of *Non-Non-Action* (wúbùwéi) brings transformation without—
thus, the ancients who skillfully advanced the Dao
did not seek to enlighten the people,
but rather to *quell* (yù) them.

Enlightenment makes the pure and the turbid mix, bringing chaos,
*quelling* (yù) preserves simplicity and stillness.
Moreover, the people can be led but cannot be made to know.

The people are difficult to govern
because their wisdom is excessive and they have knowledge.

Wisdom is a tool for contention,
so governing with wisdom is the ruin of the state—
is this not because it makes them enlightened?
Not governing with wisdom is the state’s blessing—
is this not because it *quells* (yù) them?

The ruin of the state comes from opening the way to human designs—
thus, resentment is born.
The blessing of the state comes from opening the way to Heaven—
thus, *virtue* (dé) is born.

「This pair of principles is also the standard and model that can be emulated and followed. To know the standard and model, one can then observe the Way of Heaven, hence it is called *Mysterious Virtue* (Xuán Dé). *Mysterious Virtue* is the highest virtue, hence it is profound and vast. Nothing can find its equal in things, but only align with the great order. Thus, it opposes all things, and only then does it reach the great order.

**Chapter Sixty-Six: The King of All Valleys (Jiānghǎi)**
The reason the rivers and seas can become the king of all valleys is that they excel in yielding. Therefore, they can be the king of all valleys. Hence, the sage who desires to be above others does so by speaking from below, and who desires to lead others does so by placing himself behind them. Thus, the sage, though in the highest position, is not burdensome to the people; though in the lead, he does not harm them. Therefore, the world rejoices in pushing them forward without tiring.

Because he does not contend, none under Heaven can contend with him.
The rivers and seas, by their excellence in yielding, gather the flow of all valleys and become their king. The term *king* (wáng) carries the meaning of returning and going, hence one who holds high rank but yields to the lowly, and greatness but serves the vast, gains the people’s loyalty. Therefore, the sage embodies the Way of Heaven by speaking from below, and though in the highest position, the people do not burden him—thus, those who follow him find it effortless. He embodies the Way of Earth by placing himself behind, and though in the lead, he does not harm the people—thus, those who benefit from him are many. If this is so, then from the west and east, from the south and north, none will fail to submit without thought. Therefore, the world rejoices in pushing them forward without tiring.

In essence, it is nothing more than excellence in yielding.
Only those who excel in yielding do not contend with things, hence none under Heaven can contend with them.

**Chapter Sixty-Seven: The World’s Saying**
The world says of my Dao: *"It seems like the unworthy, yet how great it is!"*
Only because it is great does it seem like the unworthy.
If it seemed like the worthy for long, it would be trifling.
I have three treasures, treasures that I hold fast.
The first is *compassion* (cí), the second is *frugality* (jiǎn), the third is *not daring to be first under Heaven* (bù gǎn wéi tiānxià xiān).

*Compassion* makes one courageous;
*frugality* makes one broad;
*Not daring to be first under Heaven* makes one a vessel of enduring greatness.
Now, if one abandons *compassion* yet seeks courage,
abandons *frugality* yet seeks breadth,
abandons *placing oneself behind* yet seeks to be first—
then one dies.

*Compassion*, when waging war, ensures victory;
when defending, ensures steadfastness.
Heaven, intending to save, uses *compassion* to shield them.
The worthy seem small, while the unworthy seem great.
The Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, filling the six extremes, vast beyond measure—
thus, it seems like the unworthy.
Heaven is great, Earth is great, and they merely emulate the Dao—
thus, they can endure.

Yet Heaven and Earth are but a minute thing within the void—
their relation to the Dao is also minute.

Therefore, I hold fast to my three treasures.
The first is *compassion*—the Way of the Father, the origin of creation, speaking of Heaven.
The second is *frugality*—the Way of the Mother, the guardian of accumulation, speaking of Earth.
The third is *not daring to be first under Heaven*—the origin of Heaven and Earth, responding only after being moved, never acting before things, speaking of the Dao.

When Heaven and Earth combine and employ the Dao,
it is serene and boundless, and all beauties arise from it.
No treasures surpass these three.

All people possess these;
one should treasure them and not lose them,
holding them as the highest.

The Way of Heaven gives life and covers it—
this is called *compassion*.
Though compassionate, it does not contend yet triumphs—
this is why *compassion* makes one courageous.

The Way of Earth nurtures and accumulates—
this is called *frugality*.
Though frugal, its virtue aligns with the boundless—
this is why *frugality* makes one broad.

Only the great Dao encompasses the origins of Heaven and Earth;
though one does not dare to be first under Heaven,
life and transformation depend on it to stand—
this is why one can become a vessel of enduring greatness.
If one opposes Heaven and Earth and abandons the great Dao,
then one dies.

*Compassion* ensures victory in war
because it battles the yielding with the assertive.
It ensures steadfastness in defense
by embracing the *Mysterious Way*.
Moreover, when one battles disorder with order,
waiting for the time to move—
then he is supported and wins.
If one cannot move, he defends with order,
and Heaven’s timing also shields and steadies him—
thus, Heaven intends to save, using *compassion* to guard them.

**Chapter Sixty-Eight: The Art of the Gentle Scholar**
The gentle scholar excels not in force,
the skilled warrior does not rage,
the victor over foes does not contend,
the master of men places himself beneath them.

This is called the virtue of non-contention,
this is called the power of employing men,
this is called harmonizing with Heaven—
the ancient ultimate.

The gentle scholar cherishes the Way of the three treasures,
not using arms to coerce the world but employing force.
To wage war against others is to be skilled in war,
to overcome foes is to be skilled in victory,
to employ men is to be skilled in governance.

The skilled warrior waits for the time before moving;
though he wages war, he does not rage—
embodying the treasure of *compassion*.

The skilled victor considers victory before meeting;
though he prevails, he does not contend—
embodying the treasure of *frugality*.

The master of men does not scheme for himself,
but delights in employing others—
thus, men gladly serve him,
embodying the treasure of *not daring to be first under Heaven*.

If one excels in these,
then it is called the virtue of non-contention,
the power of employing men,
and harmonizing with Heaven.

Yet the ancient *orthodox* (zhèng) became *unconventional* (qí),
thus arose the warning of using arms—
hence it is said: the ancient ultimate.

Who knows its ultimate?

**Chapter Sixty-Nine: The Sayings of Using Arms**
The sayings of using arms are:
*"I do not dare to be the host but become the guest,
nor dare to advance an inch while retreating a foot."*

This is called *having no path but to follow* (xíng wú xíng),
*repelling without arms* (rǎng wú bì),
*returning without foes* (réng wú dí),
*grasping without weapons* (zhí wú bīng).

No calamity is greater than underestimating the enemy,
for underestimating the enemy nearly forfeits my treasures.
Thus, when armies clash in confrontation,
the compassionate prevail.

The sayings of using arms are not my own;
they are the common words of those who wage war.
*"I do not dare to be the host but become the guest,"*
then I am pressed before moving,
arising only when unavoidable—
never provoking others,
merely responding to them.*

**"The Sayings of Using Arms (Continued) — Chapter 69**

When one cannot avoid it, then it is not the case of *leaping forward to wage war* (yǒng yuè yòng bīng) but of taking delight in killing as one’s purpose—
thus, one does not dare to advance an inch while retreating a foot,
and so it is called *having no path but to follow* (xíng wú xíng).
*Repelling without arms* (rǎng wú bì) means to wage war skillfully yet without anger.
*Returning without foes* (réng wú dí) means to vanquish the enemy well yet without contention.
*Grasping without weapons* (zhí wú bīng) means to employ others skillfully yet place oneself beneath them.
This is the profound understanding of the **Three Treasures’ Dao** (sān bǎo zhī dào).

Yet the **Three Treasures** (sān bǎo) are not solely for discussing war—
how is it that the ancient extreme (jí) has come to this point of using arms?
Arms are cruel instruments; one must not underestimate the enemy,
for underestimating the enemy is to delight in killing.
Abandoning one’s **virtue of compassion** (cí) and **courage** (yǒng),
and taking up **frugality** (jiǎn) yet **broad ambition** (guǎng),
or **following others** (hòu) yet **placing oneself first** (xiān),
thus nearly forfeiting my treasures.
Therefore, when armies clash in confrontation,
those who are **compassionate and merciful** (āi lián) are virtuous (cí).
If one takes **virtue** (cí) as one’s treasure,
then there will be no calamity of underestimating the enemy,
and so one will prevail.

**The Sayings of Using Arms Are Very Easy to Know — Chapter 70**
My sayings are very easy to know,
very easy to practice—
yet none under heaven can know them,
none can practice them.
Words have a **root** (zōng),
affairs have a **master** (jūn).
Only because of **lack of knowing** (wú zhī),
they do not know me.
Few know me,
so those who follow me are noble.
Thus the sage wears coarse robes yet holds precious jade (bèi huái).
With **no thought and no concern** (wú sī wú lǜ), one begins to know the Dao—
this is why it is easy to know.
With **no following and no teaching** (wú cóng wú dào), one begins to attain the Dao—
this is why it is easy to practice.
Yet the wealthy and noble of the world squander their desires and lose their true nature (zāng yù yǐ sàng zhēn),
while the poor and lowly labor excessively and harm their lives (láo yì yǐ shāng shēng),
all losing themselves to things,
and their nature to customs—
thus none can know, none can practice.

Words have a root—
to clarify the meaning of a chapter,
and establish its **principle** (tǒng) as its root—
is this not what is called easy to know?
Affairs have a master—
to clarify the practice of a chapter,
and establish its **authority** (zhǔ) as its master—
is this not what is called easy to practice?
If one does not lose its root and master,
how could one not know or not practice?
Thus the sage says:
If you follow my Dao,
you should know the **Supreme Enlightenment’s Source** (shàng huì yuán),
for wisdom (zhì) is not born alone—
all must respond to their causes (yīn).
If you lack the **practice of the Host’s Original Nature** (wú xíng sù běn),
this is called lack of knowing—
how could you clarify the **Mysterious and Profound Dao of the Supreme One** (tài shàng xuán miào zhī lǐ)?
This is why they do not know me.
There are those who know without words,
who see what others do not—
and those who attain without learning,
who perceive what others do not—
thus those who know the Dao are few,
proving that those who truly see are noble.
Hence the sage appears **thin in externals yet rich in internals** (bó yú wài ér hòu yú nèi),
does not flaunt himself before others,
and holds the **jewel of Kunshan Mountain** (kuī shān zhī yù) yet remains unknown.

**The Sayings of Knowing and Not Knowing — Chapter 70**
To know what one does not know—
this is **exalted** (shàng).
To not know what one knows—
this is **illness** (bìng).
Only because one **diseases the illness** (bìng bìng),
one does not fall ill.
The sage’s non-illness comes from his disease of the illness—
thus he does not fall ill.
The Dao is originally **without knowing** (wú zhī),
yet through **no thought and no concern** (wú sī wú lǜ), one knows it—
thus it is called *knowing what one does not know*—
this is called **true knowing** (zhēn zhī).
To not know the Dao of *not knowing what one does not know*,
yet to **clearly** (zhāo) **discuss profound and subtle theories** (gāo tán miào lùn)
to **exhaust the principles and penetrate the roots** (jīu běn qióng yuán),
this is called **illness of knowing** (bìng zhī).
Only those who know that **knowing is an illness** (zhī zhī bìng wéi bìng)
and **forget their knowing** (ér wàng qí zhī),
thus do not fall ill.
How is it that the sage does not fall ill?
Because he knows that **knowing is an illness**,
yet always acts as if he does not know—
thus he does not fall ill.

**The Sayings of the People Not Fearing the Way — Chapter 72**
If the people do not fear the **Way’s威** (wēi),
then the **great威** (dà wēi) will arrive.
Do not **narrow their dwelling** (xiá qí suǒ jū),
do not **exhaust their life** (yàn qí suǒ shēng).
Only because of **non-exhaustion** (bù yàn),
one does not exhaust.
Thus the sage **knows himself yet does not reveal himself** (zì zhī bù zì xiàn),
**loves himself yet does not honor himself** (zì ài bù zì guì)—
thus he abandons that and takes this.

Anger and **威** (wēi) are small,
non-anger and **威** are great.
The sage does not bend the world with his **威**,
but makes the people **not fear the容 of威** (wēi zhī róng),
while having **the heart to fear virtue** (dé zhī xīn)—
then the **威 of non-anger** (bù nù zhī wēi) silently prevails over them—
this is called the **great威 arriving**.

To **transform the people** (huà mín) so they attain their nature (xìng) fully,
then to **expand and fulfill them** (kuò ér chōng zhī),
their dwelling will not be narrow—
to **nurture and complete them** (yù ér chéng zhī),
their life will not be exhausted—
this is how the sage embodies the **Dao of Heaven and Earth** (tiān dì dào).

Embodying **Heaven’s great威** (tiān dà wēi) yet not angering,
embodying **Earth’s broad dwelling** (dì guǎng jū) yet not narrowing,
embodying **the Dao’s perpetual generation** (dào shēng shēng) yet not exhausting.
Only the **Supreme One** (shàng) does not exhaust the people’s life—
thus the people attain their nature fully and are not exhausted,
and so the sage does not reveal himself yet is clear.
Only through **clarity** (míng) does one know oneself and embody Heaven and Earth,
and so not honor oneself yet is virtuous (dé).
Only through **virtue** (dé) does one love oneself and follow the **great Dao** (dà dào),
thus abandoning self-revelation and self-honoring,
and taking this embodiment of the **Dao of Heaven and Earth**.

**The Sayings of Courage in Daring and Not Daring — Chapter 73**
Courage in daring leads to **death** (shā),
courage in not daring leads to **life** (huó).
These two paths—
one beneficial, one harmful—
are what Heaven detests—
who knows their reason?
Thus the sage finds them difficult.
The Dao of Heaven is:
to **prevail without contention** (bù zhēng ér shàn shèng),
to **respond without words** (bù yán ér shàn yìng),
to **call without summoning** (bù zhào ér zì lái),
to **be plain yet skillful in plotting** (tǎn rán ér shàn móu).
**Heaven’s net is vast and open** (tiān wǎng huī huī),
**sparse yet never losing** (shū ér bù shī).

To be **courageous in daring** (yǒng yú gǎn) and place oneself before the world—
this is called **contrary to Heaven’s Dao** (nì tiān dào),
and so one dies.
To be **courageous in not daring** (yǒng yú bù gǎn) and not place oneself before the world—
this is called **embodying Heaven’s Dao** (tǐ tiān dào),
and so one lives.
Yet courage in not daring is beneficial to life yet harmful to customs,
while courage in daring is beneficial to customs yet harmful to life—
in the eyes of the world, this cannot be doubted,
and so they are confused.
If Heaven detests it,
who can truly know its reason?

Moreover, Heaven’s Dao **diminishes excess and benefits humility** (kuī yíng ér yì qiān),
so those who follow Heaven endure,
while those who go against Heaven perish—
thus the sage finds them difficult and does not dare to act.

Heaven’s Dao originally has no purpose—
when all things emerge,
it emerges with them yet does not claim credit,
when all things return,
it returns with them yet does not reject them—
all things receive their life from this,
and so it is called *prevailing without contention*.

The four seasons proceed therein,
and all things are born therein—
yet it speaks not and responds with perfect ease.

The virtuous are blessed by it,
the licentious are doomed by it—
yet it summons none, and all come of their own accord.

It shows humanity simplicity to know,
and responds to all things with boundless variation—
yet it is straightforward and ever well-planned.

The Heavenly Net is vast and wide,
spread yet never failing—
is this not how it works?

**Chapter 74: The People Do Not Fear Death**
The people do not ordinarily fear death—
how can one terrify them with death?

If one makes the people constantly fear death,
and those who act strangely are seized and killed,
who would dare?

There are always officials charged with killing.
If one substitutes for the officials who kill,
it is like substituting for the master carpenter to wield the axe.
If one substitutes for the master carpenter to wield the axe,
few will escape uninjured hands.

When the people retain their natural inclinations,
they always find joy in life.
If they lose their natural inclinations,
what is there to fear in death?

Even if harsh laws are imposed to terrify them with death,
the people will still defy them and never be truly reformed.
If one makes the people constantly fear death,
it is to ensure they retain their natural inclinations
and recognize the joy of life—
thus, they will avoid transgressions.
If there are those who act strangely,
I may seize and kill them—
who would dare to do so again?

There are always officials charged with killing—
this is called *virtuous governance by decree*.
If one substitutes for the officials who kill,
it is called *unvirtuous governance by edict*.
If the people do not ordinarily fear death,
yet one terrifies them with death—
is this not like substituting for the master carpenter?

The master carpenter of all things is the sovereign of creation.
The sovereign of creation is the Dao of Heaven’s non-action.
To act against Heaven and manipulate things is *action*—
few escape self-harm.

**Chapter 75: The People’s Hunger**
The people’s hunger arises from their rulers’ excessive taxation—
thus they hunger.
The people’s difficulty in being governed arises from their rulers’ interference—
thus they are difficult to govern.
The people’s indifference to death arises from their rulers’ excessive indulgence in life—
thus they regard death lightly.

Only those who do not cling to life are superior to those who prize it.
The king regards the people as Heaven,
and the people regard food as Heaven.
The sage’s governance reduces punishments,
lightens taxes and levies,
and understands the *Heaven of Heaven*—
only then can the people be preserved.

Excessive taxation arises from heavy burdens,
yet they do not know to lighten taxes and levies to nourish the people—
thus the people’s hunger.
The rulers’ interference arises from burdensome governance,
yet they do not know to reduce punishments to settle them—
thus the people’s difficulty in being governed.

In general, human nature thrives in prosperity,
then harbors anxiety,
and returns to simplicity and purity,
then desires nothing else.
When hunger and disorder prevail,
they do not accept their proper measure,
and their pursuit of gain grows ever more frantic—
thus, some are driven to death’s brink by excessive indulgence in life,
and so they regard death lightly.

Only those who embody the Dao
guard their inner realm with harmony,
and their vital essence remains unspent while their Heavenly nature is preserved.
Such beings understand the essence of life
and do not strive for what cannot be sustained—
this is superior to prizing life while regarding death lightly.

**Chapter 76: The Nature of Life**
When life begins, humanity is soft and weak;
when death comes, it becomes rigid and strong.
When plants and trees begin, they are tender and brittle;
when they die, they wither and decay.
Thus, rigidity and strength are the companions of death,
while softness and weakness are the companions of life.
Therefore, strong armies do not conquer,
and rigid wood snaps—
hence, rigidity and strength belong below,
while softness and weakness belong above.

In life, bones are weak and sinews supple;
in death, sinews and bones become rigid and strong.
In life, bark is tender and branches supple;
in death, branches and leaves wither and decay.
Thus, rigidity and strength are the companions of death,
while softness and weakness are the companions of life—
this is the natural order.
Strong armies do not conquer,
just as rigid wood snaps—
rigidity and strength are companions of death,
thus they belong below,
while softness and weakness are companions of life,
thus they belong above.
This is also the proper way of Heaven and Earth.

**Chapter 77: The Dao of Heaven**

「天之道，其犹张弓与？高者抑之，下者举之，有余者损之，不足者补之。天之道，损有余而补不足也。人之道则反：损不足以益有余。孰能损有余而奉不足於天下？唯有道耳。

是以圣人行而不恃，功成不居，不欲以己之贤显於人。天之道，畎中为至，无过与不及。其犹张弓乎：高者抑之，不使有余，故有余者损；下者举之，不使不足，故不足者补。天道减盈满，补虚空，毁强盛，益衰弱。人之道则一切相反，损不足以益有余。能以无为之道奉天下者，唯天道然。圣人体道者也，故行而不恃，功成不居，不以己之所长自见於人，常无损，此乃圣人之所以能天。

**Chapter 78: The Dao of the World’s Softness and Weakness**
天下莫柔弱於水，而攻坚强者莫之能先，以其无以易之也。柔胜刚，弱胜强，天下莫不知而莫能行。是以圣人言：受国之垢是为社稷主，受国之不祥是为天下王。正言若反。

天下莫柔弱於水，而能攻坚强之物者，物莫能胜，以其有常而无以易之也，故几於道矣。柔胜刚、弱胜强，天下莫不知而莫能行，何哉？以其益生，以其心使气，故失柔弱之道。夫柔弱有常而无以易之者，其唯天地之道乎？唯地之道，受国之垢而不自化，乃化化者也，是谓社稷主，此之谓柔之胜刚者欤？唯天之道，受国之不祥而不自生，乃生生者也，是谓天下王，此之谓弱之胜强者欤？夫正言若反者，受国之垢与不祥也。以正言之，若反者矣。

**Chapter 79: Harmonizing Great Grievances**
和大怨者，必有余怨，安可为善？是以圣人执左契，不责於人。故有德司契，无德司彻。天道无亲，常与善人：阳为德，无为也；阴为怨，有为也。

世之人勇於敢为，故怨生。加以知慧仁义以和大怨，怨愈多矣。若是者，安可为善？且知慧外通，七义多责，故敢为多怨。是以圣人执天之行，处无为之事，行不言之教，予於人而不取，故不责於人，何怨之有？

上德无为而报怨以德，故曰有德司契。下德有为而以和大怨，故曰无德司彻。天之道，是谓上德者：无亲无疏，唯善人无为者常与之。

**Chapter 81: Faithful Speech is Not Ornate**
信言不美，美言不信。善者不辩，辩者不善。知者不博，博者不知。圣人无积，既以为人己愈有，既以与人己愈多。天之道，利而不害；圣人之道，为而不争。

信言者，希言也，其出口也，淡乎其无味，故不美。」

**Chapter 81 (continued): Faithful Speech is Not Ornate**

*"Beautiful speech"* is mere pretense—
when one speaks lightly and promises much,
trust is scarce, and thus it is untrustworthy.

The Dao of Heaven speaks not, yet responds with perfect goodness—
thus the virtuous do not argue.

To reconcile great grievances—
how can it be called good?

Hence, those who argue are not virtuous.

The wise understand principles deeply,
and in grasping truth, they return to simplicity—
thus the wise are not learned in excess.

To drown in vast knowledge only multiplies what one sees and hears,
yet it falls short of true clarity—
thus the learned are not truly wise.

To be unadorned, unpersuasive, and unburdened by excess—
this is to dwell in non-possession within oneself.

The Dao of the Sage is non-possession within oneself,
so it flows without accumulation.
Thus the Sage has no hoard—
with hoarding comes insufficiency,
but without storing, there is abundance.

The Sage, having no hoard,
nourishes the world with the Way of abundance—
all turn to draw from it without depletion,
and so the more one gives to others, the more one possesses,
the more one bestows, the more one has.

For the Sage’s Dao is the Dao of Heaven itself—
Heaven’s Dao benefits without harm,
and thus the Sage’s Dao acts without contention.

Moreover, Heaven bestows beauty and benefit upon the world—
what harm could there be?

The Sage acts through non-action,
neither disrupting Heaven’s order
nor defying the nature of things—
what contention could there be?

This is the conclusion of the *De Jing*,
for virtue encompasses the Dao,
and the Dao encompasses Heaven.

To fail to comprehend Heaven is to fail to grasp the Sage—
thus the *Mystic Classic of the Dao and Virtue* ends here.
