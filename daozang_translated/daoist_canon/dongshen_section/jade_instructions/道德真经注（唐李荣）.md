**The *Daode Zhengjing Zhu* (Commentary on the *True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*)**

**Title and Attribution:**
*The Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*. Composed by the Daoist Li Rong during the Tang High Zhen period. The original text comprised two scrolls. Two fragmentary versions now survive:
1. *The Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), under the *Dongshen* (Cavernous Gods) section of the *Yujue* (Jade Precepts) category, preserving the original preface and commentaries on thirty-six chapters of the Dao scripture, arranged in four scrolls.
2. A Dunhuang fragmentary manuscript, containing commentaries on the *Dejing* (Virtue Classic) forty-four chapters and the thirty-seventh chapter of the Dao scripture. Though combined, the two texts remain partially incomplete.

The present edition collates the *Daozang* version with the Dunhuang manuscript, supplemented by the *Daode Zhengjing Xuande Mushu* (Mysterious Virtue and Profound Commentary on the *True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*) by Qiang Sici (hereafter, the Qiang Edition), reconstructing a complete text. The original work lacked chapter divisions; these have been added according to the standard transmitted version.

**Preface to the Commentary on the *Daode Zhengjing***

The Daoist subject Rong humbly speaks:

I have heard that the silent and tranquil precedes the primal heaven,
Yet the heavens lack brilliance to reveal its splendor.
The undifferentiated gives rise to things,
Yet the myriad things are insufficient to fathom its subtlety.

This is the transcendent and ineffable—
Beyond all forms, yet profound and boundless.
It traces the profound workings of the Cosmic Potter,
And its principle lies in the responsiveness of the Void.
It unfolds the hidden paths of the Craftsman-Guide,
And its meaning resides in the numinous diagram.

Thus, the sacred scriptures of the Celestial Village
Establish communion with the Imperial Symbols before their manifestation;
The True Sovereign of Ku County
Reveals the august origin of the numinous spirit.

Five thousand years of blessings descend,
And the mystic wind manifests in harmony with the Celestial.
The twin pillars flow with divine destiny,
And the purple qi shines upon the Imperial Throne.

I humbly observe that Your Majesty,
With jade-like virtue compiling the sacred,
And golden gates responding to the diagram,
Illuminates the radiance across the waves of the luminous mirror,
While auspicious vapors drift over the peaks of longevity.
You nurture the divine at Fen River,
And with the Great Compass alone transform—
Seeking the Dao at the Yellow River’s banks,
And practicing supreme benevolence without domination.

The sacred texts of the numinous caves
You personally labor to revere,
And the secret scrolls of the Immortal Metropolis
You graciously peruse with sagacious insight.
Concentrating at the Yellow Court to embody the subtle,
And bathing in the Dark Feminine to flow with humility,
You thus attain the stillness of the *Niqishang* (Rainbow Robe) wind,
And sever the transformations of the *Kunhai* (Dark Sea) with non-action.

Examining the scripture, I see that the Sage governs
By attending to affairs of non-action,
And practices the teaching of unsaid words.
It is also said: *"The Sage governs by emptying the mind and filling the belly."*
These anterior and posterior numinous confirmations
Are as if seals fitting together.

Ancient and modern masters
Do not clarify the profound intent,
For the divine spirit has yet to behold the Sage’s concentrated stillness.

Now, the Heavenly Opening of Your Majesty’s heart
Shines brightly and distinctly—
Truly the manifestation of the primal transformation of Great Peace,
Unfolding before the ages,
And establishing the supreme function of non-action,
Displaying auspicious omens for a thousand generations.

How could it merely echo the *Hetu* (River Diagram) records,
Transmitted in vain since the Han,
Or the vermilion inscriptions of the Shang,
Merely preserving the characters of the Zhou?

Its words are subtle yet profound,
Its principles profound yet distant.
Like gazing upward to the *Xīhé* (Sun God),
Where the six voids shine uniformly,
Or being moistened by the Supreme Good,
Where all things harmonize.

Thus, past sages and virtuous worthies vied to explore its depths,
While Wei-Jin scholars of brilliance faltered at the threshold of being and non-being.
Qi-B Liang Daoists erred in admonishing and encouraging within the domain of non-trace.
Those who merely echoed it were enshrouded in mist,
Talking of nothing but emptiness;
Those who wandered astray were lost in vaporous illusions,
Firmly grasping at existence.
Some merely touched upon the upper mechanism,
Leaving it incomplete,
While those clinging to petty knowledge
Made it verbose without simplicity.
Thus, this single scripture has spawned a hundred commentaries,
Confusing the Daoist winds like chaotic alarms,
And mingling the *Jing* and *Wei* (clarity and muddiness) in the sea of wisdom.
Assisting the age and guiding customs,
Sometimes obstructing the Dao’s gate,
Piercing the void yet failing to unlock the key of emptiness.

I, Rong, though my years are devoted to the Dao,
And my name recorded in the elixir registers,
Have rinsed my heart in the pure stream yet it is not still water,
And though I face the dark stone, my mirror hangs askew.
Dwelling among the red cinnamon and white cassia,
I have long listened to the fragrant winds,
Dancing and singing by the Green Stream,
Yet my back has been exposed to the Tang sun in vain.

With my inflated nature,
I twice received the words of perspiration and toil,
And thus dared to wield the jade scepter in the Purple Court,
And listen to the golden decrees upon the Vermilion Steps.
Though I frequently engaged in lofty discourse,
My inner sincerity remained unexpressed.

For the vast abyss of the Three Mountains
I drift upon the Lynx Isle without measuring its depths;
For the nine wells of the flowing spring,
I gaze upward at the Dragon’s virtue as if it still existed.

Daring to exhaust my mediocrity,
I venture to compose this commentary.
Though I strive night and day,
My understanding is but a drop in the ocean,
Yet like the mountain’s foundation supporting the clouds,
I hope to achieve something in the ant-hill of the world.

May I not merely imitate the myriad wonders,
But aspire to the formless symbol of the Dao’s pearl.
With dust clinging to the imperial canopy,
I fear the depths of the abyss.
With utmost trepidation,
I humbly present this offering.

**Commentary on the *Daode Zhengjing* – Scroll One**

**Chapter 1**
*The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.*

*The Dao*—this is the principle of the utmost void.
To discuss the principle of the utmost void,
One cannot divide its manifestation into being and non-being,
Nor can one measure its truth with high and low.

Thus, the utterly profound transcends prior cognition,
And the utterly real cannot be grasped by mundane understanding—
*"Mysterious, yet difficult to ponder;
Profound, yet impossible to fathom."*

The Sage wished to lay bare this profound path,
And opened the gate of teaching,
Borrowing the name *Round and Penetrating* (圓通)
To designate the principle of the utmost void.
Since the principle can be named,
And the named can be called *Dao*,
It is said: *"I do not know its name; I call it Dao."*

*The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao*—
This is not the common, mundane Dao of humanity.
The common, mundane Dao of humanity
Is honored through rites and propriety,
Valued for its superficial brilliance,
Where one sacrifices the self for fame,
And forgets the self for gain.
Having lost the Dao and its virtue,
This teaching now prevails.

Now, having discarded the superficial trappings of benevolence and righteousness,
And taken the substance of Dao and virtue,
Ceasing frivolous conduct and returning to the pure source,
Reversing habitual emotions—
Thus, it is called *the Dao that is not the eternal Dao*.

**The name that can be named is not the eternal name.**
*The name*—this is the designation of the Great Dao.
I forcefully name it: *"Great!"*
A name does not stand alone;
It arises from the substance.
A character does not exist independently;
It is established by virtue giving form to principle,
And in its operation, it does not stagnate—
Encompassing all, it reaches the boundless.*

**The Dao That Can Be Named**

Thus, with the name of the Great Dao,
I proclaim its essence,
So that all things may understand it.
Hence, it is said: *"The name that can be named."*

The name that is not the eternal name—
This is the name of vain worldly glory, not the true.
Therefore, I reject it as *not the eternal Dao*,
So that one may abandon the transient and return to the eternal truth.

Names arise from causes,
And wisdom progresses by gradual or sudden stages.
To open the way with principles,
One seizes the transient to grasp the eternal truth.

When laid out to its ultimate conclusion,
There is no eternal Dao to seize,
Nor is there a true eternal to take.
Not only is it not the eternal Dao,
But it is also not the transient.
If it is not the transient, then the eternal is transient,
And if it is not the eternal Dao, it is also not the transient.
Thus, the eternal and the transient are both beyond grasp.

Before names arose, Heaven and Earth began.
With names, all things took form.
The Dao’s virtue is profound and mysterious,
Its principle transcends existence and non-existence.
Since existence and non-existence are transcended,
Names are cast aside.

Yet the function of boundless emptiness—
Where can it not apply?
Therefore, though it is not existence, it exists,
And the nameless is the origin of the two *complementaries*.
Though it is not non-existence, it is non-existent,
And the named is the parent of all things.
Hence, the Dao generates virtue and nurtures,
This is what is meant.

To observe its mystery, one must be ever without desire.
To observe its subtlety, one must be ever with desire.
All who receive life
Draw their origin from Dao and virtue,
Share the same *qi* from Yin and Yang,
Yet their clarity and obscurity differ in spirit,
Their stillness and agitation differ in nature.

If one smooths the heart and stills the path,
Washes the will in the mysterious depths,
Then desires cannot disturb the spirit,
And distractions cannot cloud the intention—
The luminous *spirit platform* is clear and still,
The profound *mirror of the Dao* is deep and bright—
Then one may perceive the faintest traces,
Comprehend the subtlest mysteries.
This is the *conduct of without desire*.

If one cannot yet abandon the mind,
And remains bound to the realm of existence,
Chasing after right and wrong,
Agitating over sounds and colors,
Then one is merely caught in the affairs of existence,
And does not recognize the principle of non-action.
This is the *conduct of with desire*.

Subtlety is a trace, a return, a coming.
This means relying on Dao and virtue for conduct,
Observing profound principles to enter the cycle—
Losing the emptiness and stillness, calling them false,
And staining oneself with coarse methods, drifting into subtlety and traces.
These two arise from the same source yet bear different names.

Speaking closely,
With desire and without desire—these are the two.
This is called *humanity*.

All share the same substance of the Five *Eternal Virtues*,
And all possess the same *mind of an inch*.
They are the same.
To dim the sharpness and embrace tranquility,
To pierce through the Dao’s source,
This is to attain the profound.
To compete with prior knowledge and be entangled in confusion,
To sink into the world’s realm,
This is to drift into subtlety.
These are the differing names.

Speaking broadly,
The sages sought to expound the principle of boundless emptiness,
Thus taking Dao and virtue as their core.
Therefore, in this chapter,
They vividly illuminate this meaning,
And pair it with Dao and virtue.

Hence, it is said:
Though the two bear mixed and obscure principles,
They are one in essence.
The movement arising from stillness,
The use emerging from substance,
Hence, it is said: *they arise*.
The function of the Dao’s generation,
This is the *Dao itself*.
The meaning of nurturing,
This is the *virtue* made manifest.
Dao and virtue bear distinct names,
Thus, it is called *differing names*.

The profound is said to be the same.
The Dao of emptiness and stillness,
The profound virtue of mystery,
Is not easily discerned,
And its silent depth is not easily spoken.
No one can name it,
So it is called *the same*—
The mystery of the most profound mystery.

Without anything to establish,
Only the Dao and virtue can speak of the profound,
Hence, it is said: *"The profound virtue is deep and distant,
The ultimate Dao is profound and still."*

The profound beyond the profound,
Is the gateway to all mysteries.
Dao and virtue are remote and obscure,
Their principle surpasses words and forms.
The true core is empty and profound,
Their affairs transcend existence and non-existence.

Borrowing speech beyond words and forms,
Recording the marks of existence and non-existence,
To traverse the hidden path,
Hence, it is said: *"The profound beyond the profound."*

Yet fearing those lost in direction may cling to rigid principles,
And those who lose the principle may cling to fixed dogmas,
If one lingers here and calls it the true Dao,
Hence, it is said in its utmost terms:
It is not the mark of existence and non-existence,
So the name is called *profound*—
Borrowing *profound* to cast off existence and non-existence.
Once existence and non-existence are cast aside,
The profound is also lost,
Hence, it is said: *"The profound beyond the profound."*

The profound beyond the profound—
Three reversals are not enough to speak of its extremity,
Four phrases cannot fully convey its source.
Boundless and unobstructed,
It encompasses the pivot of all phenomena,
And opens the windows of a hundred spirits.
This is the gateway to all mysteries.

**Two Chapters**

All under Heaven know *beauty* when it is called *beauty*,
Then *evil* has already arisen.
*Beauty* is *joy*.
It is said that humanity’s inherent nature
Cannot take the Dao as delight,
But takes desire as joy.
Joy cannot be exhausted,
And when joy reaches its peak, sorrow comes.
Desire cannot be indulged,
And when desire is indulged, the nature is harmed.
Hence, it is said: *"All take sounds, colors, flavors, and tastes as supreme joy.
They do not know that sounds, colors, flavors, and tastes
Are the greatest calamities of the *Great Uncarved Block*.
Once they become calamities of the *Great Uncarved Block*,
They also become the roots of sorrow.
To extinguish the nature and harm the body—
This is where *evil* arises."*

All know *good* when it is called *good*,
Then *not-good* has already arisen.
Under Heaven and upon Earth,
Noble and ignoble alike,
Few can empty the heart and the self,
Yet all indulge desire and emotion.
Though their loves differ,
Each follows their own emotions—
Loving names, they call names *good*;
Loving gain, they call gain *good*.
To love gain as *good* is to seek gain without the Dao;
To love fame as *good* is to court fame to the point of self-destruction.
Though it conforms to emotion, it is *not-good*.
Hence, the Master of *Bountiful Virtue* died for fame atop *Chief Yang*,
And the Bandit *Zhi* died for gain beneath the *Eastern Mound*.
This is where *not-good* arises.

Hence, existence and non-existence give rise to each other,
All things under Heaven are born from existence,
Existence from non-existence.
From non-existence comes existence,
And from existence returns non-existence.
Thus, it is said: *"They give rise to each other."*

Difficulty and ease complete each other,
For all difficult matters under Heaven
Must first be made easy.
Difficulty arises from ease,
And ease accomplishes difficulty.
Ease arises from difficulty,
And difficulty completes ease.

Long and short take shape from each other,
For things separated have neither great nor small,
But gathered, they have short and long.
The *Great Mountain* and the *autumn hair* differ in proportion,
The *white crane* and the *green duck* differ in leg length—
Hence, it is known:
To avoid them is to have neither great nor small,
To preserve them is to have short and long.

High and low incline toward each other—
*Incline* means *danger*.
Water can bear a boat,
Yet also overturn it.
The high relies on the low as its foundation,
But the low is as perilous as the high.
Though the low is humble,
It yet endangers the high;
The high, though noble,
If it truly annihilates the low,
Then when the *Dao* is lost, high and low endanger each other,
But when the *Dao* is attained, both ruler and subject find harmony.

Sound and voice harmonize together—
The ruler transforms the people below,
Like wind swaying the grass.
The people follow the ruler above,
Like echoes answering sound.
It is like the *gong* and *shang* notes,
Alternately singing in harmony.
If the pitch is too high, the strings will snap;
If the ruler is too hasty, the people will grow restless.
Thus, when the Five Tones are in accord,
The Eight Sounds are perfectly attuned,
And when governance is harmonious,
The people rejoice.
Hence it is said: *"The sovereign is the people’s teacher,
And the people take him as their model."*

Before and after follow in sequence—
The ruler acts first, and the minister follows;
The father acts first, and the son follows.
Thus, those who rule as fathers and sovereigns
Must not act lightly or lose the heart of the *Dao*,
But should instead uphold stillness
And align with *virtue*.

Therefore, the Sage governs
By doing nothing yet achieving all,
By teaching without speaking,
While all things act without complaint.
Gazing back through the ages,
Some are coarse, some refined.
Surveying the hundred kings,
Their steps were sometimes swift, sometimes slow.
None have inscribed their titles on golden tablets,
Nor recorded their deeds in royal annals.
The Emperor responds to the thousand-year cycle,
And upholds the seven-hundred-year foundation,
Without wielding arms,
Yet takes joy in boundless fulfillment—
Thus, the sacred lineage shines far beyond its beginnings,
And its destiny is sealed before form takes shape.
Hence it is said: *"The Sage governs by doing nothing."*

Mighty generals stabilize the four quarters by upholding *威*,
Ministers and officials govern by discussing the *Dao* and clarifying affairs—
Their influence is not through words alone.
Hence it is said: *"They teach without speaking."*

*Action* is what is spoken of here—
The four classes each fulfill their duties,
All things retain their true nature,
And follow transformation naturally,
Without resistance or complaint.
To give birth yet not possess,
To entrust to *spontaneous transformation*,
To use without knowing—
To act yet not rely on it,
To treat all things as *chúgǒu* (sacrificial straw dogs),
Not claiming *virtue* as one’s achievement.
When success is attained, one does not dwell on it.
Though adorned with splendor,
One remains detached and distant—
Seeking the *Dao* beyond *Xiāngchéng*,
And focusing the spirit toward *Gūshè*.
Only by not dwelling does one not depart.
The *Dao* pervades the universe,
While *virtue* encompasses the Two Principles.
Though *virtue* avoids functional display,
The people revere it.
With effortless governance, the Nine Regions are pacified,
And through *wuwei*, the myriad states come in tribute,
The spirit ever serene.
Hence it is said: *"It does not depart."*

**Chapter Three:**
Not to exalt the worthy
Makes the people not contend.
The *Wang Dao* is vast and impartial,
Nobles and commoners alike are like jade and stone in the same dust,
The worthy and the foolish share the same rope—
This is the transformation of the *Great Dao*,
Where there is no contention.
The worthy must be placed in their proper station,
Rewards must be given for merit,
The foolish must be assigned to labor,
Punishments must be meted for offenses.
If rewards exceed merit,
Excess leads to arrogance and extravagance.
If labor exceeds capacity,
Poverty and exhaustion follow.
Arrogance and extravagance breed deceit and violence—
Even beasts, when cornered, will fight—
Thus, contention arises.
Hence the sun and moon shine impartially,
Not altering their light for the worthy or unworthy;
Heaven and Earth cover and nourish all,
Not lightly changing their ways for the good or evil.

**Chapter Four:**
Not to prize rare treasures
Makes the people not steal.
Abandon the jade of ten cities,
Cast aside the pearls of a thousand gold,
Regard them as tiles and rubble—
Who would steal?
If desires are unseen,
The heart remains undisturbed.
The ears do not hear the *Zhèngwèi* zither and pipes,
The eyes do not see the beauties of *Páo Sì* and *Dá Jǐ*,
The heart is purified, the self cleansed,
Emotions abandoned, desires forgotten—
Who would be disordered?
Thus, the Sage governs
With unified *virtue* and accumulated *ren*,
Perfecting goodness and beauty.
The *Laozi* wished to exalt the Sage’s *virtue*,
So he spoke of this as well:
Empty the heart,
Eliminate desires,
Sever right and wrong,
Abandon myriad concerns,
Preserve the One Truth.
Fill the belly,
Hold the *Dao* in the breast,
Let *virtue* fill the inner self.
Weaken the will,
Softening the heart to follow the *Dao* without resistance.
Strengthen the bones—
Only when the *Dao* gathers in emptiness,
When the empty heart embraces the *Dao*,
When the *Dao* resides where there is no harm,
Does one attain the strength of the *xian*.
Always keep the people ignorant and desireless,
So that the wise dare not act.
To act with *wuwei* is to govern completely.
Above, spread the winds of *wuwei*,
Below, cultivate the pure and simple transformation.
When the people follow above,
And both high and low are at ease,
Then there is no transformation that cannot be transformed.

The *Dao* is boundless yet used—
Or it does not overflow.
*Boundless* means *central*.
*Overflow* means *full*.
The *Dao* is not a partial thing;
Its use must lie in the center.
Heaven abhors fullness—
Fullness invites loss,
Hence it is said: *"It does not overflow."*
Fullness must have deficiency,
Emptiness must have substance.
The *Dao* of central harmony
Is neither full nor deficient,
Neither having nor lacking.
Having and lacking are not true,
Fullness and deficiency are not real—
Borrowing the medicine of the central path
To cure the ailments of the extremes.
When the illness is gone, the medicine discarded,
When the extremes are removed, the center forgotten,
There is nothing left at all.
This is also the meaning of *"not overflowing."*

Deep as the sea, it seems the origin of all things.
The sea is deep, so all streams flow toward it.
The *Dao* is deep, so all things revere and serve it.
Dull its sharpness—
Foreknowledge harms nature,
Prolonged evil harms others—
This is *sharpness*.
With an empty heart and forgotten self,
The *Dao* bends it—this is *dulling*.
Untangle its confusion—
Desires disrupt propriety,
Gain and loss confuse the heart—
This is *confusion*.
Abandoning the other, forgetting the self,
Distant from desires, controlling emotions—
This is *untangling*.
Harmonize its brightness,
Blend with the dust—
Serene, as if it might exist.
Bright yet not dazzling,
Stained yet not blackened,
Harmonious yet not obscured in form,
Blended yet not burdened in truth.
Thus, it is known:
Serene and tranquil, it remains ever present.

I do not know whose child it is,
Yet it precedes the Emperor.
The *Dao* is profound and mysterious,
A boundless abyss—
Even *迎* and *随* cannot fathom its end.
How then can it be defined?
Hence it is said: *"I do not know whose child."*

Unlocking the natural order,
It is divided by the **Three Powers**,
Its creative function unfolds,
Encompassed by the **Ten Thousand Beings**.
Examined in its practical application,
It precedes the Celestial Sovereign—
This mirrors Heaven.

**Chapter Five**
Heaven and Earth are without *virtue*,
Treating all things as *chúgǒu*.
Long and short define each other,
Right and wrong oppose each other—
This is the natural *Dao*.

*Virtue* is love,
And where there is love, there is hatred.
Heaven and Earth act without intention,
Severed from love and hatred.
Because they love not,
They are called without *virtue*.

*Chúgǒu*—
Straw shaped into a dog,
Used in ancient rites,
Then discarded.

It is said of people toward *chúgǒu*:
They use it without loving,
Abandon it without hating.

This illustrates how Heaven and Earth,
Warm as spring’s spontaneous harmony,
Are not called *virtuous*,
Cold as autumn frost’s descent,
Are not called *righteous*.

The Sage is without *virtue*,
Treating the people as *chúgǒu*.
The Sage acts without intention,
Merging in *virtue* with Heaven and Earth.

Without *virtue*, the meaning of *chúgǒu* is clear.
Though grace nourishes grass and trees,
Benevolence covers swine and fish,
Propagating wind and unfolding transformation,
It must first benefit humanity—
Hence, "the people."

Between Heaven and Earth—
Is it not like the *tuóqiè*?
Empty yet unyielding,
Moving yet ever flowing.

*Tuó*—the bellows.
*Qiè*—the flute.
*Yielding*—exhaustion.
*Interval*—the space between.

The *tuóqiè* is hollow within,
Thus it emits sound and breath without exhaustion.
Heaven and Earth are hollow within,
Thus they generate all things without end.

If one can empty the heart and body,
Deploying wisdom and *virtue* without limit,
There is no exhaustion.

Many words lead to ruin,
Better to hold to the center.

*Ruined*—confined.
As if filling the world with reason yet committing no fault.

Speaking without precision—
Words leave the mouth, calamity enters.
Calamity enters—
This is ruin.

Yet calamity and fortune lie in correctness or error,
Gain and loss are not in excess.

Now, many words lead to ruin—
A warning against the loss of speech,
Encouraging adherence to the center’s gain,
So that teaching is unobstructed and words forgotten within.

**Chapter Six**
The *Gu* spirit does not die—
This is called the **Mysterious Female**.
The *River Above* said:
Nurturing the spirit is the method of *thinking-preservation*.

Húisì remarked:
The emptiness within the valley—
This is metaphorical language.

Though true sages’ lofty insights
Are all explanations of things,
Now we simplify the principle and attempt to speak.

*Gu*—emptiness.
*Xuan*—the *Dao*.
*Pìn*—stillness.

With form and spirit, there is a master.
With birth and death, the *Dao* cannot be spoken of—
Flowing, unstable, how can it be called still?

If one can empty form and spirit,
Abandoning self and object,
Exhaling rootless *qi*,
Gathering without calling it birth,
Inhaling windowless *qi*,
Dispersing without calling it death—
Neither death nor birth—
This is the *Dao* of the *Gu* spirit.

Birth and death are unstable things.
Deep, feminine, still—
This is the meaning of the *Mysterious Female*.

The **Gate of the Mysterious Female**—
This is the root of Heaven and Earth.
The *Dao* in stillness—
Formless, without attributes.
When it moves,
It generates Earth, generates Heaven.

*Qi* manifests from here,
Thus it is called the **Gate**.
Heaven and Earth depend on it to live,
Thus it is called the **Root**.

Endless, as if it exists—
Using it is effortless.

*Endless*—subtle and wondrous.
The *Dao* of the *Mysterious Female*
Neither generates nor perishes,
The principle of feminine stillness
Neither exists nor vanishes.
To speak of existence—no form is seen,
To speak of vanishing—all things are born.

Neither flourishing nor decaying,
Neither constant nor severed—
Thus, *endless*.

*Effort*—toil.
Obtaining the *Dao* of the *Mysterious Female*,
Its use is boundless, effortless leisure.
Thus, it is said: *effortless*.

**Chapter Seven**
Heaven endures, Earth persists.
The reason Heaven and Earth endure and persist
Is that they do not generate themselves,
Thus they can endure and persist.

The sun and moon revolve and thin,
Their waxing and waning cannot be halted.
Yin and Yang contract and expand,
The cycles of cold and heat pass easily.

All things beneath them are insufficient,
Thus Heaven and Earth alone endure.

Examining the *virtue* of Heaven and Earth,
Asking the reason for their longevity,
None but the heartless,
The selfless in generation.

If one can model Heaven and Earth,
Acting without intention,
Nurturing without self-interest,
The bones of the Immortal will surpass gold and stone in endurance,
The *command* will embrace the square and round in permanence.

If one cannot abandon right and wrong to align with the *Dao*,
Discard emotions and desires to condense the *True Self*,
Then deaf and blind to sound and color,
Numb to fragrance and flavor,
The body toils externally,
The heart wearies internally—
Then a hundred years are like morning dew,
A thousand gold like evening dust.

Thus it is said:
People’s disregard for death
Comes from their thickened vitality—
Thus they disregard death.

Hence the Sage places himself last,
Yet his body is first.
He sets himself aside,
Yet his body persists.

Few abandon emotions and extinguish schemes,
Many pursue desires and betray the *True Self*.
Only the Sage knows and acts.

This is acting in humility to dwell among things,
Placing *virtue* last so as to be first in honor,
Preserving the *Dao* externally so the body persists with it.

Not that he lacks selfishness—
Thus he fulfills his selfishness.

Ordinary emotions are obscured,
The numinous awareness is clear.
Without a heart of utter impartiality,
There are actions of partiality.
Exalting self while burdening others,
Enriching self while impoverishing others,
Desiring to lead yet unable to surpass others,
Seeking to preserve yet the body already lost.

The Sage, without intention, dwells first among things—
Naturally first without emotion and desire, thus naturally preserved.
Hence it is said: *fulfilling his selfishness*.

**Chapter Eight**
The highest *virtue* resembles water.
Water benefits all things yet does not contend,
Dwelling where people dislike—
Thus it approaches the *Dao*.

The principle is profound and distant,
Difficult to fathom.
The virtuous cultivate the *Dao*,
Their actions are subtle and wondrous.
Thus water is borrowed as an analogy.

Water can moisten things,
The *Dao* can rescue people—
Hence it is said: *beneficial*.
Water clears blockages,
The *Dao* accommodates humanity—
Thus it is said: *does not contend*.

「Things often abhor the low,
Yet people often love the high.
Now water flows, drawn to the low,
The *Dao* acts with humility and retreat—
Thus it is said: *dwelling where people dislike*.

**Near** (*几*) is **close**. The nature of water is akin to the *Dao*,
Hence it is taken as an analogy.

*Residing in virtuous places*—
Water does not choose its place,
Flowing wherever it finds itself—
Those who cultivate the *Dao*,
Wherever they dwell, is virtuous.

*Heart’s virtue is profound*—
Water’s stillness reflects clarity.
Humans, when the heart is empty, become mirrors.
*With virtue in kindness*—
Water harmonizes with all things,
Kindness embraces the common folk.

*Words of virtue are trustworthy*—
Water’s mirroring reveals objects,
Beauty and ugliness without losing their form.
Kindness in speech,
From beginning to end, does not depart from truth.

*Governance’s virtue is rectitude*—
Great peace is unmatched by stagnant water’s neutrality,
Nor does it surpass the virtue of the people.
*Matters of virtue are accomplished*—
Water’s lack of contrivance does not hinder its purpose—
Why then cannot the *Dao*-cultigating person achieve all things?

*Action’s virtue is timely*—
Water freezes in winter, overflows in summer,
Never straying from its proper season.
The virtuous act in accordance with the times,
Never failing in what is appropriate.

Only because it does not contend,
Is there no resentment.
Water itself has no intention—
If a person empties themselves,
Not contending with things,
Naturally there is no fault.

**Chapter Nine**
*Fulfilling what is held*—
To hold and overflow is not as good as *its already* (*已*).」

**Chapter Ten**
The *qi*-vessel tilts when full and must topple,
Excessive indulgence reaches its limit and must fail.
If one wishes neither to topple nor fail,
Only the unarrogant and unfilled endure.

Sharpened by comparison, it cannot long persist.
Honored, it invites criticism; austere, it invites censure.
With sharp resolve to stand apart,
One becomes the object of others’ scorn—
Difficult to long endure.

Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them.
Gold and jade without feet flow freely on their own.
Disasters of water and fire, none can repel.
Bandits come—difficult to defend against.
Thus, the greedy who hoard lose *virtue*,
While those who accumulate and then disperse align with the *Dao*.

Rich and noble yet proud—
They invite their own ruin.
Wealth piled but not dispersed,
Using nobility to oppress others.
Fault arises from within, not from without.

When achievement is complete, name secured, step back—
The *Dao*’s way.
Yin and yang succeed one another,
Cool and warm shift in turn—
Things have no fixed principle;
This is the constant *Dao* of Heaven.
If one clings to honor and does not withdraw,
Destruction is inevitable—
Thus the *Er Chu* discerned the signs.
The Four Recluses departed in their wisdom,
Understanding the principles of things,
In harmony with Heaven’s *Dao*.

**Chapter Eleven**
*Carrying the spirit-essence, embracing the One*—
Can one remain undivided?
*Carrying*—to govern.
*Camp*—to protect.
*Essence*—the body’s spirit.
*One*—the *Dao*.
Humans are the spirit’s chariot—hence *carrying*.
A pure body calms the spirit-essence,
A turbid heart drives away the true spirit.
Severing thought to guard the spirit—hence *camp*.
The heart unclouded, undivided—hence *One*.
When wisdom aligns with the *Dao*,
Spirit and form unite—
Thus it is said: undivided.

*Concentrating qi to attain softness*—
Can one be like an infant?
A unified body and heart are pure and undispersed—
Concentrating qi.
Obtaining the *Dao* of longevity—
Attaining softness.
Unknowing the union of yin and yang,
Without clinging to right and wrong,
One can be like an infant.

*Purifying and gazing into the mysterious*—
Can one remain flawless?
Bathing in the *Dao*’s flow to cleanse the heart—*purifying*.
Wafting the numinous wind to dispel burdens—*cleansing*.
Inner and outer round and tranquil,
Like water’s clear stillness.
Exterior and interior pure and bright,
Free of blemish like jade and pearl.

*Loving people, governing the state*—
Can one act without action?
In high station yet unable to transform oneself,
One relies on others.
Transforming things and people,
Affairs depend on tranquility.
But those who act with agitation harm things,
While those who act without action love people.

*Heaven’s gates opening and closing*—
Can one be receptive?
Heaven has four seasonal gates:
The Azure Gate opens—warmth arrives,
The Vermilion Gate opens—heat arrives,
The White Gate opens—coolness arrives,
The Black Gate opens—cold arrives.
Now the petty folk complain of summer’s heat and winter’s cold—
This is inability to be tranquil.
*Closing*—to shut.
One gate opens while three close—
Receptive tranquility.
The Sage’s spirit condenses in the Great Void,
Wisdom stilled in the Empty Mystery.
Life and death, failure and success cannot disturb,
Fire and water, cold and heat cannot move.
Illuminated in all directions,
Can one remain without knowing?

The Sage’s wisdom encompasses all things,
Clarity equal to the two luminaries,
Illuminating the four quarters—
Fourfold illumination.
Illuminating yet ever still,
Shining yet not blazing,
Abandoning perception, blending the heart—
Can one remain without knowing?

*Nurturing and preserving*—
The *Dao* gives birth, *virtue* nourishes.
The Sage aligns with the *Dao*’s birth and nurturing,
Guiding the black-haired masses in pure transformation,
Nourishing all creatures in their natural state.
Giving birth yet not possessing,
Acting yet not relying,
Governing yet not dominating—
This is called *Mysterious Virtue*.
Forgotten are merit and *virtue*—
The highest *virtue* is without *virtue*,
Thus it has *virtue*.
Forgotten *virtue*’s *virtue*,
Deep and far-reaching—
Hence *Mysterious*.

**Chapter Twelve**
The five colors blind the eyes,
The five tones deafen the ears,
The five flavors dull the palate.
Though eyes can see, indulging in color without end
Loses their brightness.
Though ears can hear, wallowing in sound without rest
Loses their acuity.
Though the mouth can taste, probing flavors exhausts
Their nourishment.
*Dull*—to lose.
Yet blindness is justified by not seeing,
Deafness by not hearing.
Having eyes yet not seeing—
The True Person, the Great Sage, is blind.

**Chapter Thirteen**
To have ears yet not hear the vast *Dao*’s subtle music—
This is deafness to the soul’s refined sound.
The mouth’s use lies in knowing taste,
Yet if one craves vulgar flavors, one strays from the *Way*—
Thus, *taste* is called *dull*.

Chasing hunts across fields drives the heart to madness.
To indulge in fowling and fishing,
*Taikang* abandons his duties,
Zhang Yi falls ill from hunting fame—
This is the height of madness.

Rare treasures bring obstruction to one’s path.
Beautiful women and precious gems—
These are rare.
To let them disrupt the heart
Is to harm one’s conduct.
Thus, the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes,
And so discards the one to take the other.

To empty the heart yet fill the inner self—
This is nourishing the belly.
To listen in reverse yet not be blind—
This is not indulging the eyes.

Burdensome deeds are cast aside,
The *Way* of *wuwei* is embraced.

---

**Chapter Fourteen**
What cannot be seen is called *Yi*:
The *Dao* is distant—
The eye cannot perceive it,
Yet the Sage embodies it,
And alone comprehends its clarity.
Thus it is called *Yi*.
*Yi*—level, unobstructed.

What cannot be heard is called *Xi*:
The great sound is subtle,
Beyond the ear’s reach,
Yet the Sage penetrates it,
And alone hears its harmony.
Thus it is called *Xi*.
Mysterious teaching is rare—
Subtle speech, natural.

What cannot be grasped is called *Wei*:
The great form has no shape,
Unattainable to touch.
The Sage’s profound insight
Pierces the void’s essence.
Thus it is called *Wei*.
*Wei*—mechanism, emptiness.
Responding to things—mechanism.
Beyond all names—emptiness.

These three cannot be questioned,
Thus they merge into one.
*Xi, Wei, Yi*—three in essence.
Neither sound nor color,
Nor form nor name,
Neither presence nor absence suffices to define,
Nor length nor breadth can be measured.
Mingled chaos, undivided,
Named as one.

One is not one—
Because of the three, it is one.
Three is not three—
Because of the one, it is three.
From one comes three—
Three is one and three.
From three comes one—
One is three and one.
One does not complete one,
Three is one and three.
Three does not complete three—
Three is not three.
One does not complete one—
One is not one.

Without one, without three,
This is the logic of forgotten speech.
Clinging to three or one
Obstructs the fluidity of the Mysterious Teaching.

Above, it is not bright,
Below, it is not dark.
Vast and boundless—
It cannot be named.
Bright—illuminated.
Dark—obscured.
Vast—unfettered, unrestrained.

Riding the ten thousand things yet unattached,
The Supreme *Dao* is neither bright nor dark,
Cannot be named by light or shadow,
Nor perceived by sight or hearing.
The principles of *Xi* and *Yi*,
Having silenced the three and one,
Transcend all existence—
Thus it returns to *wu*.

*Wu*—nothingness, nothing to return to.
To know nothingness is to know nothing.
This is the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious,
Discarded yet again.

This is the form of the formless,
The image of the imageless—
This is called *hūhuang*.

To transcend existence and return to nothingness,
Nothingness has no form—
To perceive *Xi* and *Yi* through sight and hearing,
Yet *Xi* and *Yi* return to stillness,
Lest the bewildered fail to awaken,
And cling only to the formless,
Showing the lost the way home.

To open the form of the formless—
This arises from essence’s function,
The image of nothingness—
This is the cessation of response, returning to truth.

To cease response and return to truth
Is to gather traces and restore the root.
From essence’s function arises motion—
Stillness’s motion—
Speak of it as *wu*—
Yet suddenly, there is.
To gather traces and restore the root—
Speak of it as *you*—
Yet suddenly, there is not.

Suddenly not—
This is only fixed *wu*.
Suddenly yes—
This is only fixed *you*.
The fluctuating *you* and *wu*—
No name can contain it.

Approach and you see no head,
Follow and you see no tail.
*You*—it has a front to meet.
*Wu*—it has no rear to chase.
To approach and see nothing—
This is not *you*.
To follow and see nothing—
This is not *wu*.

The ancient Dao is held to govern the present’s *you*.
Govern—this is to rectify.
The ancient Dao is rectified by *wu*—
The present Dao is perverse by *you*.

The Sage upholds the Dao of *wu*
To rectify the *you* of action,
To cease the frivolous and thin,
And restore the pure and harmonious transformation.

To know the ancient beginning—
This is called the Dao’s foundation.

The mysterious ancient Dao is hard to know,
The *wu*’s wind is rarely awakened.
The superior governs the inferior with rectitude,
The inferior follows the superior with reverence.

**Chapter Fifteen**
The ancients who excelled as scholars
Were subtle, mysterious, and penetrating,
Deep beyond recognition.

The Dao of old was hard to walk,
Yet the wise of antiquity could cultivate it.
The Dao is subtle, essential, and wondrous,
Mysterious, still, and empty—
Its practice is extreme, reaching the utmost subtlety,
Unobstructed, with no stagnation.

When practice aligns with the Dao,
It is unfathomable and hard to know.
It cannot be spoken of with words—
He who speaks of it does not grasp the Dao;
It cannot be recognized with recognition—
He who recognizes it strays from truth.
Thus it is said: *It cannot be recognized.*

Since it cannot be recognized,
We forcefully give it form—
Form, meaning appearance.
The Dao is hard to ponder,
Its practice hard to discern—
Fearful that later scholars may lack the means to embody the Dao,
Students may not know how to establish and walk it,
Below, we briefly outline its appearances
To encourage and exhort.

Like one crossing a river in winter—
Stepping on thin ice,
Fearful of sinking into the depths,
The living fear danger,
Trembling, not daring to act wrongly,
Diligently knowing only to advance on the Dao.

Like one fearing the neighbors—
In the midst of the world, acting wickedly,
Startled by the neighbors’ warnings to awaken,
Resolving to follow the Dao and do good,
Fearful of the consequences in both life and death,
To be reproached by both the living and the dead.

Solemn in appearance—
In appearance, only to quietly cultivate the Dao,
Not to move recklessly.

Dissolving like ice about to melt—
On a fine spring day, the ice thaws,
The mysterious wind rises, and burdens dissolve.

Plain like uncarved wood—
Thick without being thin,
Substantial without being ornate.

Vast like a valley—
The valley’s emptiness
Holds all things and responds to sound.
The heart’s emptiness
Embraces the Dao and aids the world.

Mixed like turbid water—
The heart without distinction—mixed.
In harmony with the world—turbid.
Holding jade without stain,
Clutching a pearl, self-luminous—
Yet appearing turbid.
Who can, through stillness, gradually clarify the turbid?
Who can, through tranquility, gradually bring forth life from motion?
Tranquility—stillness.
Gradually—slowly.

To still movement in the heart,
The spirit naturally becomes tranquil.
To not disturb the water,
The turbid naturally clears.
Few practice this.
Thus it is said: *Who can?*

Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.
Above, we broadly expound on the Dao’s practice to encourage learners—
If one guards it, one attains clarity and stillness,
Humbly retreating, not indulging in excess.
Only by not being full
Can one be depleted and yet renewed.

Those who establish themselves do not aspire to fullness,
Assisting with loyalty and rectitude—
Though aged, they return to youth,
In depletion, like rebirth.

Learners of the Dao empty their hearts of sounds and colors,
Wash away worries and dissolve entanglements—
Though in a decaying body and corrupt world,
They yet attain fulfillment in the true Dao.

**Chapter Sixteen**
To perfect emptiness, to firmly hold stillness.
Its nature is still and true,
Its practice clear and distant.
Those who guard it deeply
May attain the Dao of perfect emptiness.

All things arise together—
Common people cannot guard *wu*,
Taking ease and stillness as the emotions’ movements,
Abandoning truth for falsehood,
Losing the root and chasing the branches.
I observe their return.

Return—root.
Common people lose the root and chase the branches,
Abandoning purity for frivolity.
The Sage suppresses the branches and honors the root,
Turning frivolity back to simplicity.

Things, teeming and diverse,
Each return to their root.
Things—also people.
Root—also the root.
Speaking of people with one heart clinging to myriad realms,
Their affairs are not singular—
Thus it is said: *teeming and diverse*.
The Sage all encourages returning to the root,
Thus it is said: *each return to their root*.

Returning to the root is stillness,
In the branches, the wheel turns back to the root,
Motionless and unmoving.
Stillness is called *returning to command*.
Nearly speaking, the strong and violent
Do not meet their natural end—
Their names are cut short in mid-life.
Preserving emptiness and stillness,
One attains the full span of life—
This is called *returning to command*.

Farther spoken of, movement brings birth and death,
Losing true nature.
Stillness brings neither death nor birth,
Returning to the enlightened command.

Returning to command is constancy—
Birth and death are thus interrupted.
Neither death nor birth—thus constancy.
Knowing constancy is clarity.
Those who are confused about this principle are dark,
Those who awaken to this Dao are clear.
Not knowing constancy—reckless action is calamitous.
Knowing constancy and trusting the Dao—
All actions are auspicious,
Heaven aids, people assist—
Thus it is said: *auspicious*.
Going against the Dao, following perversity,
Indulging emotions and will—
Stumbling into error, acting improperly,
Man and spirit condemn—
Thus it is said: *calamitous*.

Knowing constancy is capacity—
Knowing constancy, reaching principle,
Equal to the void, containing all—
Thus it is called *capacity*.
Capacity can be impartial.
Rectified without partiality.
Impartiality can rule—
Partiality cannot govern things,
Impartiality naturally can reign supreme.
Rule can align with Heaven—
Broad and heartless, moving in due season.
Heaven can embody the Dao—
In harmony with Heaven and Earth in virtue,
Shared in the Dao, aligned in truth,
Unobstructed and flowing,
All movement in accord with reason.
The Dao can endure—
The Dao has existed since ancient times,
The Sage enjoys eternal life without end.
No danger at the end of life—
End—termination.
Aligned with Heaven, in accord with the Dao,
Ending in this body,
Forever without peril.

**Chapter Seventeen**
The Supreme Sage—
The inferior know of his existence.
The Supreme Sage—referring to the ruler of supreme virtue.
Virtue, though not virtuous,
Its name is hard to name—
Only that the Great Person is above,
Speaking of the Supreme Sage,
The superior embraces virtue and the Dao below,
Needing nothing from below,
Self-sufficient above,
Nothing to receive—
Ruler and subjects, superior and inferior,
Know only of his existence.

The next—
He is praised and honored.
The ruler of lesser virtue has traces of action,
Not yet able to forget words.
Above, he is trusted by his subjects,
Below, he is praised by his superiors.

The next—
He is feared and insulted.

---

...unable to follow the transformations of all things,
to allow nature’s essence to unfold naturally,
and to establish laws and punishments to intimidate them—
thus they speak of being feared.

With commands numerous, the people below grow insolent—
thus they speak of being insulted.

This is the way of the ancient past.

Trust is insufficient, so there is distrust.
As the ruler above,
he transforms through the Dao,
he demonstrates through trust.

If the ruler above trusts those below,
those below also trust the ruler above.
If the ruler above cannot trust those below,
those below do not trust the ruler above.

Yet he values words—
this is the time of the middle age.

Unable to forget words,
he borrows speech to convey meaning,
and they mutually flatter and praise each other—
thus words become heavy.

When deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,
the people say, "This is natural."

The Dao of the Emperor shines forth—
deeds accomplished,
the wind of non-action takes root—
affairs fulfilled.

Having previously explained the three ancient stages,
he speaks of losing the Dao and then virtue,
from purity to corruption—
now he restores the connection,
desiring to show the abandonment of benevolence and righteousness,
to reverse corruption and return to purity.

The Dao is shallow and easily seen,
virtue is profound and hard to perceive.
Now the Sage’s transformation is deep,
his divine power unfathomable,
his daily actions unknown—
thus they speak of naturalness.

**Chapter Eighteen**
When the Great Dao is abandoned,
benevolence and righteousness arise.

In the realm of *Zhongxuan* (重玄),
the *qi* and its manifestations cannot be kept private.
In the principle of utmost emptiness,
the void itself is insufficient to discuss.

One cannot welcome or follow it—
what beginning, what end is there?

Flourishing and decline show no change—
what abandonment, what rise is there?

In days of pure simplicity,
near and far are not divided by closeness or distance,
in hours of tranquil reverence,
superior and inferior are not distinguished by rank.

The Dao and its manifestations align naturally,
without need for binding cords or records,
walking the Great Way,
how could one rely on written contracts?

When the times are in harmony with the One,
thus they speak of the Dao’s flourishing.

Practicing partial love as benevolence,
applying censure of wrong as righteousness,
corruption and shallowness become the norm—
unable to walk the Dao,
thus they speak of its abandonment.

The times have purity and corruption,
the Dao has no rise or fall.

Wisdom emerges, and great deceit follows.
Dim and silent, the Dao’s ultimate state.
Obscured and murky, the practice’s utmost form.

Unable to illuminate yet not dazzling—
thus one knows that wisdom is adorned to startle the foolish,
and disputes are vied to outdo others.
Disputes arise in succession,
and crafty deceits multiply.
The thief Zhi follows its rules as thievery,
and the usurper Tian Cheng rides it to steal the state—
this is great deceit.

When the six relations are not in harmony,
filial piety and kindness arise.
Father and son, brothers, husband and wife—
the six relations.
Mutually dependent,
disputes do not arise.
Long and short compared,
likes and dislikes then emerge.
Harmony is marked by discord,
filial piety is named by unfilial acts.

When the state is in chaos and disorder,
loyal ministers appear.
In the age of Xu and Nong,
no tales of the limbs’ devotion were heard.
In the days of Jie and Zhou,
the virtues of the loyal and upright were first praised.

Thus one knows:
when the sun rises bright in the sky,
the stars cannot compete in their radiance;
when the timely rains descend,
the fields cannot claim credit for their growth.

If the ruler above is benighted,
and ministers below are disorderly,
yet one who can internally assist his ruler
and externally pacify the bandits
emerges—
then the name of loyalty shines forth.

**Chapter Nineteen**
Abandoning the Sage, discarding wisdom,
the people gain a hundredfold benefit;
the Sage—
one whom the people revere;
wisdom—
what the foolish seek.

Without wisdom, how could one perceive the subtleties?
Without the Sage, how could one govern all things?

Now he speaks of abandonment—
this has not been heard before.

The Sage aligns with the Dao,
the Dao itself has no name.
When names arise, things become confused—
speaking of the Sage does not reach forgetting the Sage.
When wisdom emerges, deceit follows—
using wisdom does not reach forgetting wisdom.

Thus it must be abandoned and discarded.
Yet when the Sage arises, thieves appear,
and when wisdom is employed, robbers come.
Now he speaks of abandonment—
no thieves or robbers rise,
its benefits are indeed great—
briefly speaking, a hundredfold.

Abandoning benevolence, discarding righteousness,
the people return to filial piety and kindness;
benevolence—
to love all things;
righteousness—
to yield to others.
Though called the Way to establish humanity,
it is truly also a way to distort human nature.

Now, discarding the distorting benevolence and righteousness,
and returning to the natural filial piety and kindness.

Abandoning cleverness, discarding profit,
thieves and robbers will not exist.
Discarding the skillful hands of Gong and Tu,
quieting the scheming heart—
abandoning cleverness.
Discarding jade to shatter pearls,
abandoning profit—
this is the way.

Yet thieves and robbers follow profit’s rules,
and when profit is discarded,
who would steal?
These three—
as for teaching, it is insufficient,
thus they must be followed by later words.
Teaching—
instruction.
Following—
continuation.

The Great Person’s instruction
always refines the common to reach the Sage,
guides the foolish to wisdom,
and removes harm to seek profit.
Now all are discarded,
and instruction is insufficient.
The unlearned do not know where to place their hearts—
thus he continues with later words,
to show how to establish and practice.

Seeing simplicity, holding onto purity,
few private desires, little craving.
Purity—
the root.
Unstained by all phenomena—
seeing simplicity.
Guarding the One without deviation—
holding onto purity.
Impartial yet not cliquish—
few private desires.
Using nature to regulate emotions—
little craving.

**Chapter Twenty**
Abandoning learning, there is no worry.
As for the mind’s alignment with the Dao of non-action,
then learning has nothing to learn,
blending the foolish with the wise,
then gains and losses are unheard,
embracing forgetfulness in advance and retreat,
then honor and disgrace do not alarm.

Holding onto nature and aligning with the Dao,
how could there be worry?

Only those who preserve the affairs of action,
learning is not for oneself—
those who hang their heads and pierce their thighs to compete are called scholars,
those who study by candlelight and gather fireflies vie for profit—
fearing that honorable names will not be established,
and dreading that great profits will not come,
with this in mind,
worries and troubles arise.

How far apart are *Zhi* (之) and *A* (阿)?
How different are good and evil?
*Zhi* and *A* are paired in ritual,
the wilds respond with *A*.
To conform is called good,
to oppose is called evil.
Not far—
speaking of their nearness.

To embody the Dao,
all deliberations are forgotten,
to follow truth,
all paths are suitable.
Truly, there is neither opposition nor compliance,
neither praise nor blame—
yet those who act forcefully
give rise to false distinctions and partiality,
arbitrarily fostering likes and dislikes,
not keeping their hearts in the realm of virtue and the Dao,
only blaming others with shallow and refined rituals,
calling conformity to the heart "good,"
without asking whether they are virtuous or not—

「When one polishes oneself and calls it *ability*,
without considering wisdom or its absence.
This is how the wise become obscured in folly,
and the virtuous become inverted in ignorance.
Thus it is said: *How close they are*—
also saying that human nature is naturally self-sufficient,
and adding to it breeds sorrow.

To advance wisdom for the sake of reputation,
or to adorn falsehood as evil,
though their purposes differ,
both lose their true nature.
Thus it is said: *How close they are*—

What people fear,
one must fear—
how vast and unending is this dread!
Water and fire are to be feared,
yet not fearing them leads only to burning and drowning.
Wolves and tigers are to be feared,
yet not fearing them brings only harm and injury.
Thus, when people indulge in likes and dislikes without restraint,
they return to ruin and defeat;
when they covet fame and profit without end,
they invite danger and annihilation.

Now, the common folk are long ensnared,
drowned and forgetful of return.
They drift aimlessly, with no end in sight—
the multitude bustling like feasts of *Tai Lao* [great sacrificial meat],
ascending spring platforms like revelers in bloom.
*Familiar bustling*—joy and delight.
*Tai Lao*—flavor,
*Spring platform*—color.
The common folk pursue learning to shape reputation,
indulge passions to cloud the senses with color and taste.
They delight in color,
yet know not that blindness has its time;
they gratify the mouth,
yet know not that satisfaction will fade.
Chasing desires grows old yet overflows evermore,
exhausting the body without rest,
still they take pride,
calling it joy and delight.

I alone am fearful—
before signs appear,
like an infant yet to know childhood.
*Drifting and unmoored*—
as if without destination.
The Sage speaks of the common folk racing through the realm of *doing*,
moved by sounds and colors,
while I abide in the stillness of *non-doing*,
unperturbed by fragrance or flavor.

Like the unspoiled babe,
unaware of the union of male and female,
unknowing of lustful desires,
the heart has no attachment—
how could it be fixed to any destination?
The common folk all have excess,
while I alone seem abandoned.
The vulgar cling to purity and emptiness yet lack it,
dwelling in turbidity and filth yet have abundance—
amassing wealth as external burden,
giving free rein to desires to deepen inner defilement.

The Sage is unstained by dust and filth,
casting aside worldly affairs entirely,
thus it is said: *as if abandoned*.

My heart is that of a simple fool—
*simple and pure*.
The vulgar are foolish,
yet deem themselves wise,
bewildered by emotions and desires,
soiled and disordered day by day.

The Sage’s great wisdom seems like folly,
form and spirit serene and empty,
pure and white day by day.
The vulgar are *bright and clear*,
yet unaware that true wisdom is not mere eloquence—
inner clarity of heart,
outer radiance in things,
self-proclaimed as knowing and discerning,
thus it is said: *bright and clear*.

I alone seem *dim and dull*—
knowing yet appearing ignorant,
as if veiled in darkness.
The vulgar are *sharp and keen*,
fixated on the realm of right and wrong,
concentrating on the paths of gain and loss.

I alone am *obscured and tranquil*—
abandoning heart and mind,
free from distinctions,
forgetting good and evil,
thus it is said: *obscured and tranquil*.

Diluted like the sea,
drifting without end.
The expanse of *virtue* is vast,
the heart’s platform serene—
like the great sea stirred by winds,
waves rise and fall,
drifting east and west,
yet never fixed in place.
The common folk all have *means*—
they rely on *doing*.」

I alone seem crude and vulgar—
like the ignorant fool, unadorned like the lowly.
I alone differ from others,
yet cherish *Dao* as my nourishing Mother.
Food is *use*; Mother is *Way*.
All seek fulfillment,
yet none yet speak of it.
When things lose their *principle*,
the Sage establishes teaching.
From Spring Terrace downward,
all are the afflictions of sentient beings’ *doing*.
The Sage follows illness to heal,
prescribing *wuwei* as medicine.
Illness and *doing* differ,
*wuwei* and *having* differ—
thus the distinction in speech.

The vulgar, mired in convention,
the Sage uses *Dao*—
thus it is said: *nourished by Mother*.

---
**Chapter XXI**
The vastness of *virtue’s* bearing,
follows only *Dao*.
*Kong* means "great," "most."
*Dao* is *principle*.
*Virtue* encompasses all things—
thus it is said: *bearing*.
All movement aligns with *principle*—
thus it is said: *follows*.
It is also said: *great virtue*
does not come from elsewhere,
only from *Dao*.

*Dao* as thing—
only hazy, only vague.
Not yet knowing what it is,
yet *virtue* shines forth.
The Great *Way* is profound and mysterious,
too deep to fathom.
Speak of its *non-being*,
yet it forms the mixed whole;
speak of its *being*,
yet it returns to nothingness.
Returning to nothingness yet not lacking,
speaking of something yet not absent—
*being* and *non-being* are not constant,
life and death are not fixed—
thus it is said: *hazy and vague*.
Within hazy vagueness, there is form;
within vague haziness, there is substance.
The true of neither *being* nor *non-being*,
the most profound, most mysterious *Way*—
splitting the One to open the Three *Images*,
harmonizing the Two *qi* to birth ten thousand things.

In the dim and dark, there is essence.
The ultimate *principle* is singular—
thus it is said: *essence*.
The wondrous body is unchanging—
thus it is said: *true*.
Its essence is most true,
and within it, there is *faith*.
Silent without form,
yet responsive and penetrating.
Rewarding the good, punishing licentiousness—
its influence is ever-present.
From ancient times to now,
its name does not fade,
judging all beginnings.
*Yue* means "simplify"; *fu* means "beginning."
The ignorant lack knowledge,
the vulgar are mired in delusion,
claiming the dim and dark *principle*
is originally severed from cause and effect,
that within hazy vagueness,
there is no karma—
thus the virtuous grow slack,
the wicked do not repent.
Not recognizing essence as sacred,
how could they know truth as real?
It is said: *within it, there is faith*,
to illuminate *principle* as not empty,
to save all beings by prescribing teachings,
from end to beginning,
simplifying causes of good and evil.
From ancient times to now,
judging deeds of vice and rectitude.
The loyal and filial are rewarded with rank,
the transgressors punished with law.
Embracing both emptiness and substance,
pervading the cosmos,
its body stands independent,
yet its name endures—
serene and unceasing.
How do I know all beginnings are thus?
By this.

How do I know the Great *Way*
from ancient times to now,
judging all things from end to beginning,
distinguishing among people,
freeing the four births and three ages without loss?
Only by observing the present,
can one know past and future.

**Chapter XXII**
Bend and you are whole;
crooked and you are straight.
Hollow and you are full;
worn and you are new.
Few and you gain;
many and you are confused.
Outer conformity to inner harmony,
inner nourishment of spirit—
harmony with things—*whole*.
Bow to others, yet your body does not stray from *Dao*—*straight*.
Retiring to lowliness—*hollow*.
Mixed yet not turbid—*new*.
*Principle* is originally one—
thus it is said: *few*.
Forgetting speech aligns with *principle*—
thus it is said: *gain*.
*Doing* creates myriad teachings and doctrines;
many scholars chase desires, minds in turmoil,
lost in teachings, mired in delusion—
thus it is said: *confused*.

Therefore, the Sage embraces *One* as the model for all under heaven.
*One* is *Dao*.
The Sage cherishes *Dao*—
thus it is said: *embraces One*.
All movement aligns with *principle*,
can govern things—
thus it is said: *model*.
Not self-assertive, thus clear;
not self-righteous, thus manifest;
not self-praising, thus effective;
not self-conceited, thus enduring.
Abandoning distinctions, forgetting mind,
wisdom shines forth.
Discarding *self* and *other*, preserving truth,
*virtue* becomes manifest.
Claiming merit yet losing it,
boasting of *virtue* yet not enduring.

Only the non-contending
cannot be contended with.
Claiming *I* am right,
pointing to others as wrong—
unable to follow others,
only knowing to oppose things—
contention arises.
The Sage bends to follow things,
transcends right and wrong,
does not vie for merit and fame,
competes with none—
thus, though the world be vast,
who could contend?

Was it not said of old:
*"Bend and you are whole"*?
Truly whole, returning to it.
The Sage does not monopolize,
speaking through antiquity.
Crooked and straight, few and gain—
not empty words,
truly whole, returning to the body—
all are true records.

---
**Chapter XXIII**
Few words, natural.
*Xi* means "few."
Many words exhaust meaning;
few words align with *Dao*—
thus it is said: *natural*.
*Dao* is neither *non-being* nor *being*,
*principle* is neither few nor many.
To clarify the error of many words,
borrow few words to align with *Dao*.

A gust does not last the morning,
a sudden rain does not last the day.
Swift winds and violent rains
still do not span day or morning—
light and hasty speech,
how could it preserve the body and avoid harm?
Few words align with *principle*—
then ten days of rain, five days of wind.
Many words bring damage—
then raging winds and torrential rains.
Who does this?
Ask the heavens and earth.
Even they cannot endure—
how much less humans?
This uses the great to explain the small.

Thus, those who practice *Dao*:
those aligned with *Dao* gain *Dao*.
Those who practice *Dao* are pure, empty, and *wuwei*,
saving people and benefiting things—
if all actions follow *Dao*,
*Dao* is gained.
Those aligned with *virtue* gain *virtue*.
*Virtue* nurtures things,
benefits people—
if people act in accord with *virtue*,
*virtue* is gained by people.
Those aligned with loss lose *Dao*.
Those who practice *Dao* lose it.

---

The unaligned cannot embody *virtue* and *Dao*,
nor preserve the essence of transformation and *principle*.
To conspire with evil is to act against *Dao*;
to share in guilt is to suffer punishment.

When trust is insufficient, distrust arises.
Those aligned with *Dao* gain *Dao*;
those faithful to *virtue* gain *virtue*.
Those aligned with loss lose *Dao*—
when trust is insufficient, distrust arises.

**Chapter XXIV**
Those who stand on tiptoe cannot stand firm;
those who stride cannot walk steadily.
*Stride* means to overreach.
Slow steps and measured pace endure long.
Tiptoeing and overreaching divide the stride—
such steps do not endure long.
This illustrates that humility, modesty, and yielding endure,
while arrogance and self-aggrandizement bring peril and ruin.

Self-display brings no clarity,
self-righteousness no brilliance,
self-praise no merit.
Self-aggrandizement does not last.
This is not the conduct of a *junzi*—
how much less the forgetful scholar?

In *Dao*, it is called surplus food and superfluous actions.
Though some may detest it, those who practice *Dao* do not dwell there.
Surplus food cannot be offered in sacrifice.
Overreaching steps cannot advance *Dao*.
The confused love such conduct as correct,
while the enlightened reject it as false—
thus they do not dwell there.

**Chapter XXV**
There is a thing that blends and forms,
born before Heaven and Earth.
*The thing* is *Dao*—
thus it is said to be a thing.
Yet *Dao* as a thing is vague and indistinct,
neither to be affirmed nor denied in terms of existence,
nor to be debated as yin or yang.
Mingled and formless, it arises naturally—
thus it is called *blended and formed*.

By natural principle, it moves through transformation,
within the formless, opening through *qi* and phenomena.
Its origin precedes Heaven and Earth’s birth.
Silent and vast, it stands alone and unchanging,
circulating endlessly without exhaustion—
it can be the mother of all under Heaven.

*Blended and formed*, *Dao* precedes Heaven and Earth’s birth.
Listen, and no sound—silent and vast, no echo.
Grasp, and nothing—dim and boundless, no form.
It loses its pair and has no counterpart—
thus it is said to stand alone.
Deep and enduring, it ever exists—
thus it is said unchanging.
It is nowhere absent—
thus it circulates.
To use it is effortless, without exhaustion.
Covering and nurturing all things—
this is its maternal role.

I do not know its name—
I call it *Dao*.
I force a name upon it—*Great*.
Heaven, when shaped, is named;
when formless, it is nameless.
Approximating the origin of life for use,
it is called *Dao*.
It encompasses all without singular law—
thus it is called *Great*.
Principle has no name;
nameless, yet named—
this is called *forcing*.

*Great* is called *Passing*,
*Passing* is called *Distant*,
*Distant* is called *Returning*.
*Passing* means to go.
To seek *Great* is to find no going;
to pursue *Passing* is to fail to reach *Distant*.
Its essence is near within oneself—
thus it is called *Returning*.

Thus *Dao* is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great,
and the Sovereign is great.
*Dao* is honored, *virtue* is precious—
spanning all without limit.
Heaven can broadly cover,
without distinction between noble and base.
Earth can deeply bear,
without preference for beauty or ugliness.
The Sovereign controls,
penetrating far and near.
Nurturing and equalizing the poor and rich,
each with its proper use—
this is spoken of as *Great*.

Within the realm, there are four *Greats*,
and the Sovereign occupies one.
Beyond the world’s bounds,
words may cease.
Within form and image,
principle generates names.
Though countless things exist,
ultimately there are only four *Greats*.
Since the name *Great* is singular,
its applications differ in meaning.
To exhort the Sovereign to embrace *Dao* and *virtue*,
and take Heaven and Earth as models—

Humans model Earth,
Earth models Heaven,
Heaven models *Dao*,
*Dao* models Nature.

The Sovereign, in stillness, aligns with yin’s *virtue*,
his intentions unselfish—
this models Earth.
In action, he aligns with yang’s movement,
his governance public and just—
this models Heaven.
Clear, empty, and *wuwei*,
his actions flow without obstruction,
all movement in accord with principle—
this models *Dao*.
The Sage has no desires beyond attending to affairs,
emptying himself of schemes and managing things,
his purpose returning to spontaneous transformation—
this models Nature.

This is modeling Heaven and Earth,
not Heaven and Earth modeling each other.

**Chapter XXVI**
Weight is the root of lightness,
stillness the master of agitation.
If both great and small are light,
they cannot serve as roots.
If both high and low are agitated,
they cannot serve as rulers.
Thus, one light and one heavy—
the light relies on the heavy as root.
One agitated and one still—
the agitated relies on the still as master.

Therefore, *wuwei* and stillness are the *virtue* of the ruler.
Action and agitation are the duties of the minister.
Above and below each attend to their roles—
the ruler must prioritize stillness and weight.

Thus the *junzi* moves all day without leaving his carriage.
The enlightened ruler, governing people and things,
strives for stillness and weight,
never light or agitated,
never straying from *Dao*,
never departing from stillness.
Thus his movement is with the carriage,
his dwelling with guards.
He does not reach peril and ruin—
this is the power of stillness and weight.

Though adorned with splendor,
he dwells aloof and untroubled.
What the Sage values,
what *Dao* treasures,
is stillness and weight.
Though adorned with jade halls and palaces of beauty,
his true dwelling is emptiness and silence.
Though surrounded by beauty like Naoji and Feiyan,
his mind dwells in *wuwei*.
Desires cannot burden him,
luxury cannot deceive him.
Unencumbered by things,
thus he is untroubled.

How can the Sovereign of ten thousand chariots
make his body lighter than the world?
The son of a thousand gold,
sits not on the edge of the hall.
The Sovereign of ten thousand chariots—
how can he move recklessly?
Lightness loses ministers,
agitation loses the ruler.
Earlier, stillness and weight were praised—
thus he is untroubled and unburdened.
Now, lightness and agitation are warned against—
thus harm must follow.
Unburdened, ruler and ministers are at ease;
harmed, both ruler and ministers are lost.

**Chapter XXVII**
Good conduct leaves no traces.
The seven-scented carriage gliding over water—
its movement leaves tracks.
The thousand-*li* horse leaping through clouds—
its strides leave marks.

The Sage moves without haste yet swiftly,
the cloud-carriage glides without treading the earth.
He arrives without traveling,
the phoenix-bird leaves no trace behind.

When the Sage governs with hands at rest,
no wheels mark the halls of state.
The virtuous man fades into silence,
no footprints scar the hills and valleys of Confucius.

Good speech leaves no blemish.
When words are spoken, they strike true—
a thousand *li* responds.
Without law, no speech is given—
what fault could there be?

Good planning requires no tally-sticks.
Tally-sticks count things by number,
but through the Dao, all things are already complete—
why use numbers?

Good closure needs no bolt or bar to seal,
yet cannot be opened.
Doors may be barred or unbarred,
but if governed by the Dao,
there is no closing—
nor any opening.

Thus, the ruler of the realm governs the people with the Dao,
leaving no way for spies to peer.
The cultivator refines himself with the Dao,
leaving no path for desires to breach.

Good binding needs no rope or knot to tie,
yet cannot be undone.
Those who bind with ropes know of tying and untying,
but if the Dao governs the four quarters,
this is true binding.
All under heaven unite beneath one—
it cannot be undone.

The cultivator must align with the Dao,
thus it is said: good binding.
Holding to One without separation,
it cannot be undone.

Therefore, the Sage is always good at saving people,
and so no one is abandoned.
When one thing loses its place,
his heart aches with care—
he views all as his children.
How could there be abandonment?

The True Sage expounds the scriptures to enlighten,
responds to karmic impulses to guide the common,
and rescues with the Dao—
never leaving any behind.
Always good at saving things,
thus nothing is abandoned.
From beginning to end, the Dao is applied—
thus it is said: always good.

Joy reaches all under heaven—
thus it is said: good.
Virtue can broadly rescue—
thus it is said: save.
Speaking of all things—
thus it is said: things.
This is called *Clothing the Bright*.

Practicing these five virtues,
both people and things are rescued.
Following the Dao and applying it—
this is called *Clothing the Bright*.

The good man is the teacher of the unvirtuous.
The unvirtuous are the resources of the good.
When conduct aligns with the Dao,
virtue can benefit others—
this is the good man.
The model for all people,
the standard for all things—
this is the teacher.
The dim seek the bright,
the bright do not seek the dim.
They receive them to serve,
and provide them with offerings—
these are resources.
If one does not honor the teacher,
nor cherish the resources,
though one may know great confusion,
this is called the *Essential Mystery*.

To revere the teacher and honor the Dao—
this is honor.
To be kind and persuasive—
this is love.
The meaning of resources demands honor and love,
but if the teacher does not love the resources,
the dark flow is blocked and does not nourish,
and the resources do not honor the teacher.
The path of kindness is difficult to return—
the enlightened grasp this mystery,
the benighted fall into great confusion.

**Chapter XXVIII**
Knowing the雄 yet guarding the雌,
one becomes the valley of all under heaven.
Not flattering, not arrogant,
dwelling in moderation—
this is the conduct of the gentleman.
Not still, not agitated,
dwelling in harmony—
this is the foundation of the Dao.

Thus, those who harbor雄 and fierce intentions
cannot be fully true.
Those who embrace雌 and yielding nature
cannot aspire to the Dao.
Now, knowing one’s雄 nature yet guarding the雌,
one neither agitates nor acts hastily.
Similarly, knowing one’s雌 nature yet guarding the雄,
one neither stagnates nor delays—
avoiding extremes, naturally aligning with the Middle Way.

Yet those who act with雄 and fierceness are many,
while those who guard雌 and yielding are few.
Thus, the analogy: the Han River and valleys dwell low,
and all streams flow toward them.
The virtuous and refined retreat in humility,
and morality flows to them.
Constant virtue never departs,
returning to the infant’s state.
Within, no distinctions or judgments—
this is the conduct of the innocent child.
If one can always guard stillness,
constantly aligning with virtue,
this is not departing.

Small things lack emotion,
great things have desires—
abandoning the great awareness of maturity,
returning to the childlike ignorance of infancy—
thus it is said: returning.

Knowing the white yet guarding the black,
one becomes the model for all under heaven.
Great whiteness seems like disgrace,
great wisdom seems like folly—
retiring to preserve oneself,
this is the law.

Constant virtue does not err,
returning to the boundless.
*Err* means to deviate—
not to dazzle others with wisdom,
not to harm oneself for fame,
though inwardly pure,
externally appearing as dust.
He who establishes himself receives boundless blessings,
he who cultivates the Dao attains the boundless.

Knowing honor yet guarding disgrace,
one becomes the valley of all under heaven.
Holding office and rank—honor.
Having no position, no name—disgrace.
If one can know how to dwell in display without arrogance,
and guard humiliation with humility,
this is to contain all things,
becoming the valley of all under heaven.

To be the valley of all under heaven,
constant virtue is sufficient,
returning to simplicity.
In nobility, act as the humble;
in honor, appear as the disgraced—
the true and constant virtue naturally overflows.
Constant virtue returns,
thus it is said: returning to simplicity.

Simplicity scatters to form vessels—
the Sage uses them as officials and leaders,
thus the great order knows no cutting.
Before differentiation, there is simplicity.
The Three Powers have their places—vessels.
From the formless to the manifest,
thus it is said: scattering simplicity to form vessels.
The high and low of Heaven and Earth are established,
the noble and base of ruler and subject are clear—
planting the ruler as the root,
thus it is said: officials and leaders.
Overseeing all under heaven,
thus it is said: great order.
Above, nurturing like a parent,
below, ensuring no harm—
thus it is said: no cutting.

Pity extends to all things,
and all things are preserved—
no cutting.

**Chapter XXIX**
If one seeks to take all under heaven by force,
I see that it cannot be done.
Non-action and non-doing
can govern all under heaven.
If one acts with doing and force,
I see that it cannot be done.

All under heaven is a divine vessel—
it cannot be seized.
Seizing it brings ruin,
grasping it leads to loss.
If one instead shares all under heaven’s goodness,
without privatizing its benefits,
removes all under heaven’s harm,
without claiming its rewards,
then the four seas bathe in virtue and drink in harmony,
and all things follow transformation, rejoicing in customs—
thus one can secure the great treasure,
and guard the divine vessel.

The pity of the Dao does not know force,
yet those who grasp at force as right
will meet with ruin and loss.

Thus things move or follow,
breathe or sigh,
strengthen or weaken,
gather or scatter.
The laws of action have their paths—
forward or backward,
warm or cold,
flourishing or decaying.
To gather is to bind,
to scatter is to ruin.
If one acts with force,
though it may succeed, it must fail.
If one acts with non-action,
it can undo ruin and restore.

Thus the Sage avoids excess,
avoids extravagance,
avoids extravagance’s extremes.
Excess is the pursuit of desire,
extravagance is the heart’s indulgence in waste,
and extreme indulgence is boundless greed.
The Sage empties the heart, knows sufficiency—
this is avoiding excess.
Sees simplicity, embraces purity—
this is avoiding extravagance.
Forges joy from contentment—
this is avoiding extremes.

**Chapter XXX**
Those who assist the sovereign with the Dao
do not use force to subdue the world—
their deeds return as they were sent.
Loyal ministers aid the ruler,
virtuous ministers harmonize *yin* and *yang*,
and with the Dao they prevail over all under heaven—
not by force, but by the Way.
When subjects serve their superiors,
they too should assist with the Dao.
If the ruler already follows the Dao,
how could he rely solely on arms?
The Dao brings mutual peace,
while arms bring mutual assault.
Give and take—
thus it is said: *"deeds return."*

Where armies tread, thorns grow.
After great battles, famine follows.
Fine grains cannot be planted—
thus thorns flourish.
This too is the fault of arms.
Therefore, the virtuous act decisively,
yet do not claim strength.
To use arms for righteous slaughter is decisive.
When enemies invade, they must be removed—
not by relying on the nation’s might.
Decisive, yet not arrogant,
decisive, yet not boastful,
decisive, yet not proud,
decisive, yet not without cause.
Arrogance comes from self-importance,
boasting from claiming merit,
unending victory from love of triumph,
and showing superiority over enemies—
this is pride.
Thus it is said:
*"The king’s armies win by righteousness,
those of vengeance win by victory,
those of anger perish,
and the proud are destroyed."*
The skilled warrior decides with resolve,
yet is not arrogant, not vengeful,
not greedy, not proud.
Acting only when unavoidable,
responding from behind—
their purpose is to remove the enemy and save the people,
not to revel in force or war.
This is decisive without aggression.
A steady heart knows neither pride nor arrogance,
actions taken only when unavoidable—
this is decisive without aggression.

Things flourish then age—
this is against the Dao.
The Dao rejects what is premature.
Youth must grow to maturity,
flourishing must yield to decay—
this is the way of things aging.
Those who delight in arms as strength
will see their strength fail—
thus it is said: *"against the Dao."*
The Dao may be followed always,
but what is against the Dao must cease early.

**Chapter XXXI**
Fine arms are an inauspicious tool.
Things recoil from them,
so those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.
Polished and refined—
auspicious means "good."
Arms bring the peril of lost kingdoms and slaughtered people—
thus they are called inauspicious.
Life is what people cherish,
death what they abhor.
Thus those who follow the Dao do not cherish fine arms.

The noble in peace values the left,
in war, the right.
The celestial pattern is *wen* (culture),
halting the blade is *wu* (martial).
In their uses, they are equally vital—
ritual and music must proceed together,
water and fire must not be neglected.
Action must align with principle,
movement must follow the time.
Thus in peace, life is cherished—
the left is honored—
in war, killing is paramount—
the right is valued.

Arms are an inauspicious tool,
not the instrument of the noble.
Though arms may be used,
their cost is great.
They are the domain of claws and teeth,
not the ruler’s proper tool.
When unavoidable, their use must be serene and unadorned,
victory without glory.
Serene—this is stillness.
The king who deploys armies
has cause, not war—
movement without losing stillness—
thus it is said: *"serene and unadorned."*
To delight in arms is to delight in slaughter.
Those who delight in slaughter
cannot achieve their aims in the world.
The ruler is parent to the people—
to delight in arms is not to nurture them.
Thus auspicious matters honor the left,
inauspicious matters honor the right.
The *yang* Way values life—
thus it is auspicious.
The *yin* Way values killing—
thus it is inauspicious.
Therefore, the general of the left wing resides on the left,
the general of the right wing on the right.
The left general commands the auxiliary forces—
not to kill—
thus he resides on the left.
The right general leads the assault—
thus he resides on the right.
When many are slain,
mourning follows with tears.
Victory is marked with funeral rites.
The purpose of arms is to save people—
lamenting the loss of the Dao,
grieving the excess of slaughter.
In ancient times, armies were led with compassion,
valued by virtue,
deemed inferior to moral force.
After victory, the general wore mourning robes,
conducted funeral rites,
and received condolences.

**Chapter XXXII**
The Dao is ever nameless.

「The Dao of simplicity, though small,
holds the world in awe and does not submit.
Things with names are all transient—
yet the nameless is eternal and true.
Return to the Way of constancy.
Simplicity, the root—
submission, the base.
The root of constancy is wondrous—
neither great nor small,
yet great without being exalted,
small without being debased.
If kings and lords can uphold it,
all things will submit of their own accord.
When the heavens and earth unite,
sweet dew descends.
Guard the Dao, and virtue reaches to the four quarters—
act without striving, and Heaven and Earth harmonize.
Not only do Heaven and Earth unite,
but virtue unites with Heaven and Earth.
When virtue unites with Heaven and Earth,
one knows sweet dew descends,
and one knows the spring of wine flows—
this is the transformation of the Dao.
None command, yet all align.
The ruler like a guiding branch,
the people like wild deer—
no need for teaching or orders,
yet all is naturally at peace.
At first, the Dao was named—
once named, one knows to stop.
From root to origin,
it gives birth to Heaven and Earth—
the Dao was first named.
Having obtained its child,
one knows its mother.
The child depends on the mother—
this is the order of Heaven.
Thus it is said, *knowing to stop*.
Knowing to stop prevents ruin.
The child depends on the mother—
things suffer no harm;
the man depends on the Dao—
the Way meets no peril.
The Dao spreads throughout the world,
like streams and valleys to the rivers and seas.
Streams and valleys draw from their upper sources yet never run dry,
for they take the rivers and seas as their foundation.
Taking the rivers and seas as foundation,
they return to their source and flow back to the rivers and seas.
Men are born from the Dao and must return to it—
if they fail to return, they lose their foundation.
It is also said that men have the Dao,
and all things return to it,
like streams and valleys to the rivers and seas.

**Chapter XXXIII**
To know others is wisdom,
to know oneself is enlightenment.
To hear and know is called sagely,
to see and know is called wise.
Yet what is difficult to know externally is man,
and what is difficult to know internally is oneself.
Now, to discern others and know their good and evil—
this is wisdom;
to reflect on oneself and know one’s gains and losses—
this is enlightenment.
Knowing good, one approaches the virtuous—
like staining oneself with fragrant orchids;
knowing evil, one avoids the petty—
like fleeing the fishmonger’s stall.
Knowing gain, one fulfills it with loyalty and sincerity;
knowing loss, one removes it with repentance and regret.
This is the union of enlightenment and wisdom.
He who conquers others has strength,
he who conquers himself is powerful.
The man who uses strength—
the greater his strength, the more he conquers others.
The man who uses virtue—
the higher his virtue, the more things submit to him.
Cultivating virtue and refining practice,
self-strengthening without ceasing,
not indulging in what is not—
this is conquering oneself.
The man who cultivates the Dao forgets his concerns,
and thus external things cause no harm—
hence it is said, *he conquers others*.
With an empty heart, his spirit bones grow stronger daily—
hence it is said, *he conquers himself*.
The man who knows contentment is rich,
the man who acts with resolve has purpose.
He who knows his measure,
finds joy in a single gourd and calls it wealth.
He who covets profit,
accumulates a hundred million yet remains poor.
Adorning oneself and striving for self-improvement,
acting resolutely and trusting in the Dao—
the more steadfast, the more purposeful.
He who does not lose his place endures long.
The teachings of the highest vehicle
are given to instruct men.
Following the teachings and refining one’s practice,
one does not stray from their principles.
Thus it is said, *he who does not lose his place*.
The ruler who governs by the Dao
will have his kingdom endure long.
The man who cultivates himself by the Dao
will have his life and vitality endure long.
He who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.
When the king has the Dao,
the heavens are clear, the earth is tranquil,
men are at ease, their spirits harmonious,
and there is no more danger of decline.
Even if calamities and decay should befall him,
or if fate brings adversity and obstruction,
he who dwells in danger yet finds peace,
who abides in adversity yet remains harmonious,
preserves himself through endless ages—
thus it is said, *he who dies yet does not perish is long-lived*.
The man who cultivates the Dao
with a body nearing its hundredth year
gains a lifespan beyond all measure—
this is also *dying yet not perishing*.
Yet all things have birth and death,
while men have both existence and nonexistence—
all are governed by Heaven.
The Dao neither gives birth nor perishes,
yet it can show birth and death.
Though born, it does not exist,
though it dies, it does not perish.
Neither existing nor perishing,
thus it is called *long-lived*.

**Chapter XXXIV**
The Great Dao flows unrestrained,
left and right it may be turned.
A hollow boat drifts without mooring,
the Great Dao flows and communicates subtly.
Unmoored, it is not hindered by east or west;
subtly communicating, it is not confined by left or right.
Thus, entering the finest hairs, it leaves the small behind,
spanning the universe, it forgets the great.
Its reflections are not singular,
its transformations elusive and unending.
All things respond to it—
what cannot be done?
All things rely on it for birth yet do not refuse it.
Things obtain birth through the Great Dao,
the Dao alone transforms without ceasing.
The giver of birth does not claim it as merit,
the born do not repay it as virtue.
The ultimate truth of the Dao
does not exchange words of gratitude.
Success is nameless.
The Dao gives birth to things and thus they are born—
this is success.
The giver and the born alike are forgotten,
thus it is nameless.
It clothes all phenomena yet does not rule them—
it may be called small.
It nourishes all uniformly,
covers all without distinction—
this is clothing.
It grows yet is never reaped,
thus it does not rule.
It may be spoken of as small,
yet it is not small.
All things return to it yet it does not rule—
it may be called great.
All phenomena revolve in cycles,
never escaping the formless.
It gathers all beginnings and ends,
depending on the void and emptiness.
Thus it is said, *all things return to it*.
It may be called great,
yet it is not great.
Therefore, the sage never claims to be great,
and thus he achieves true greatness.»

The sage aligns with the Dao’s nurturing and forgets merit through its ultimate principle,
never clinging to the transient or the named.
He does not confine himself to the realm of small or great,
but must transcend both—thus it is said, *he never claims to be great*.

To grasp is to become small;
to abandon the mind is to become great.
Not great yet great—
thus he achieves true greatness.

**Chapter Thirty-Fifth**
Hold to the Great Image, and all under heaven will come.
The Great Image is formless.
The formless is the Dao of boundless emptiness—great.

*Hold*—this means to focus, to sustain.
He who sustains his body beneath the shadow of profound virtue
and concentrates his mind at the gate of silent stillness
finds that when the Dao is embraced, things return—
thus it is said, *all under heaven will come*.

When they come without harm, there is peace and ease.
Like clouds spreading oil, all things are moistened;
like dew bearing fat, every grass flourishes.
Yet even in nourishing the smallest,
there is benefit—
this is the Dao’s return without harm.

How does this principle of no harm manifest?
Stillness of body and spirit is called *peace*;
oblivion to life and death is called *ease*;
mysterious harmony between all is called *tranquility*.

Delight and indulgence are but passing guests.
The five tones of music are delight;
the eight rare flavors are indulgence.
A hundred years in the body—
a passing guest.
*Stop*—this means to linger, to abide.
Those who return to the Dao can ease all emotions,
but those who fail to awaken
cling to music to vent their spirits,
rely on orchids and cassia for comfort,
and cannot hold to the Great Image—
how then can they achieve tranquility?

The Dao’s expression is bland, without taste.
The ornate and flourishing are what the world desires,
yet the void and stillness are what the human heart cannot settle upon.
What the heart desires is called *beauty*;
what it cannot settle upon is called *bland*.

The eye cannot see what is unseen,
the ear cannot hear what is unheard,
the mind cannot grasp what is limitless.
*Limitless*—this means complete, exhaustive.

What the eye perceives is color,
dazzled by the radiant hues of blue and yellow;
what the ear hears is sound,
bewildered by the discord of pitch and tone;
what the heart covets is profit,
clouded by the allure of treasures and jewels.
Though treasures bring profit,
their use is finite;
though sounds may please,
deafness knows no distance;
though colors may charm,
blindness lies near.
Thus it is known—
those who stop at delight and indulgence
suffer these afflictions.

Yet the Dao of serene simplicity and non-action,
though unseen by the eye,
reveals itself to those who penetrate—
their vision is clear, nothing remains obscure.
Though unheard by the ear,
it is grasped by those who resonate—
their hearing is acute, their wisdom deepens.
Though the mind cannot calculate it,
those who attune employ it without end.

The Dao’s appeal to the common is like this,
its paths of gain and harm are such.

**Chapter 36:**
When one is about to make it slack,
one must first stretch it taut.
When one is about to block the *fù* and close the gates,
the foolish man refuses—
thus, let him open the *fù* and cross the border,
and he will be exhausted before he ceases.

When one is about to weaken it,
one must first strengthen it.
To still the heart’s fierce and mighty spirit,
yet indulge its rigid and resolute will—
the weak will breed followers,
the strong will meet their end in action,
and suffering will reach its limit when it must stop.

When one is about to abandon it,
one must first raise it.
When it wanes, it grows yet more vigorous;
when things reach their extreme, they turn back upon themselves.
When one is about to take it away,
one must first give it.

To take away its evil,
if the evil persists unchecked,
evil accumulates to destroy the self—
only then does one awaken to its folly.
This is called *Wēimíng* (微明).

The Sage’s *quán* Dao (权道) is observed from above,
yet it does not appear like the application of teaching.
To explore its principle is to grasp its profound resources—
its subtlety is wondrous, its distinctions clear and beneficial,
hence it is called *Wēimíng* (微明).

---

**Chapter 81:**
The Dao’s transformations are expounded at length,
yet common hearts remain bound—
their attachments differ,
so the truth is shown to them,
yet they do not follow.
Thus, *quán* Dao (权道) is employed to transform them,
so they may know to return to the *Xuán* teaching (返玄教),
and its profound and distant ways suit them well.

*Quán* Dao (权道) is first revealed in argument,
the true solution is then made manifest.
To gather and restrain, open the scriptures for transformation;
to weaken worldly desires, strengthen their *xiān* essence (仙骨).
To abandon false intentions, grant them the true Dao;
to take away evil deeds, give them virtuous actions.

The soft overcomes the hard.
*Quán* Dao (权道) follows without contradiction,
thus it is said that softness must ultimately prevail over hardness—
hence it is called *victory*.

A fish cannot be taken from the depths,
the state’s sharpest tools
should not be displayed to the people.
To take from the depths is to lose it.
The fish’s swimming depends on rivers and lakes;
the Sage’s greatest treasure
draws upon the resources of sharp tools.

A fish cannot lose its water,
or it perishes.
Sharp tools cannot be shown to the people,
or danger ensues.
Thus it is said:
One may lead the people by the path,
but one cannot make them know it.
This is the way of holding to *quán* Dao (执权之道)—
it does not alter the people’s nature.

---

**Chapter 38**
The virtue/power of the highest Dao does not claim itself as virtue/power—
hence it is said to have virtue/power.
Clarifying the ancient imperial Way,
dwelling in the Supreme Void as the heart,
concentrating the utmost unity as the body,
it neither speaks nor interferes with Heaven and Earth’s transformations,
yet all things are accomplished without effort.
It does not seek the fame of ritualized courtesy,
yet there is no strife of arms.
Though dwelling at the peak of the highest and the extreme,
it neither contends nor seeks renown—
effortless and natural, hence it is called *highest virtue/power*.
Acting yet not clinging,
achieving success yet not dwelling upon it—
hence it is called *not virtue/power*.
Nurturing all things,
things attain completion—
hence it is called *having virtue/power*.
Within, one understands virtue/power and harmonizes with the Dao,
its meaning is revered—
hence it is called *highest virtue/power*.
The Dao has no form,
virtue/power is empty and mysterious—
concealing light and storing action,
hence it is called *not virtue/power*.
Though stored in action,
the actionless action is indeed action.
Concealing light,
the unblazing light is indeed light.
Having action and light,
it benefits both people and things—
hence it is said: *thus it is called having virtue/power*.

The virtue/power of the lower Dao does not lose its virtue/power—
hence it is said to have no virtue/power.
The winds of virtue/power nearly lost,
the transformations of benevolence and righteousness almost to arise—
when texts are proclaimed,
the vulgar and the refined gradually emerge—
hence it is called *lower virtue/power*.
Claiming virtue/power as virtue/power,
claiming achievement as achievement,
relying on virtue/power to attack achievement—
hence it is called *not losing virtue/power*.
Clinging to words and claiming virtue/power,
it does not reach the Dao of non-action—
hence it is said: *thus it is called having no virtue/power*.
Within, one understands the body as identical to emptiness and stillness—
this is virtue/power’s highest.
Affairs become entangled—
this is virtue/power’s lowest.
Seizing and clinging in the heart,
hence it is called *not losing virtue/power*.
The seizer loses it—
hence it is called *having no virtue/power*.

The highest virtue/power acts yet has no means to act—
*use* (为) is *action* (用).
The highest action acts without means to act upon the lower,
the lower action acts without means to serve the higher.
The lower virtue/power acts yet has means to act—
the highest action uses means to guide the lower,
the lower also uses means to serve the higher—
how so?
Grasses sway with the wind, drifting east and west,
shadows follow form, bending crooked and straight—
thus it is known:
One who rules within the seas cannot engage in many affairs,
returning to the Void and tranquility.
Teaching disciples cannot stray from propriety,
righteousness abides in loyalty and filial piety.

The highest benevolence acts yet has no means to act,
the highest righteousness acts yet has means to act.
Universal love and broad benevolence—
this is benevolence.
Rewarding the good and punishing the evil—
this is righteousness.
If one steadfastly holds to virtue/power and the Dao,
it is fitting for the highest.
The distinction between highest virtue/power and lower virtue/power,
the refined and the vulgar,
is clear in the governance of gain and loss—
non-action and action.
The lower virtue/power’s designation as action
is inferior to the highest virtue/power.
The highest benevolence’s designation as non-action
is superior to the highest righteousness.

The highest propriety acts yet meets no response—
then one forces the arms and compels it.
The *Classics of Propriety* (上礼) number three hundred,
the *thousandfold admonitions* (威仪) three thousand—
with these to instruct the people,
hence it is said: *one acts*.
Propriety becomes burdensome, chaos ensues,
the lower cannot practice it—
hence it is said: *yet it meets no response*.
This may be called: *trust insufficient, thus distrust arises*.
Trust and belief can naturally forget words,
but distrust breeds anger and contention—
thus one brandishes fists and forces the arms,
mutually dragging and pulling.
Hence: *losing the Dao, then virtue/power; losing virtue/power, then benevolence; losing benevolence, then righteousness; losing righteousness, then propriety*.

The ancient mysteries were pure and harmonious,
the sentiments of things were sincere and real—
people were self-sufficient,
not needing benevolence and righteousness to warm and nourish them.
Families practiced non-action,
each cherishing virtue/power and the Dao in their conduct.
No *hexagram lines* (爻) nor *symbols* (象) were formed,
no traces of teaching arose—
distinguishing close and distant,
forgetting noble and base—
this was the *highest Sage’s* knowledge below,
the transformation of the *Great Dao*.

When these winds scattered,
false titles arose—
the meaning of nurturing was practiced,
the achievement of assistance became visible.
The Sage’s influence was subtle,
the common folk were at ease—
this was the transformation of the *highest virtue/power*.

Kindness and affection generated,
broad love and achievement arose—
kindness had limits to its universality,
love had distinctions in its application—
the vulgar winds grew thick.
Kindness and love were insufficient to transform customs,
thus rewards and punishments were used to govern the people.
Again, the meaning of rewards and punishments was abandoned,
the rituals of benevolence and righteousness were neglected—
teaching was reduced to barter and exchange,
conduct was carried out with jade and silk—
the ruler was deceived above,
the minister was deceived below—
the pure source had faded,
the vulgar and the refined were in turmoil.
Propriety, then, was the beginning of chaos.

Foreknowledge—
this is the Dao’s superficiality,
the beginning of folly.
Virtue/power and the Dao are the Dao’s substance.
Benevolence and righteousness are the Dao’s superficiality.
Those who first recognize benevolence and righteousness
see only superficiality, not substance.
The enlightened naturally align with reason,
the ignorant still await instruction from teachers.
Knowing propriety is not the foundation of the highest wisdom—
it is the beginning of the lowest folly.
Thus, the great man dwells in substance, not superficiality,
abides in reality, not ornament—
hence it is said: *discard that, take this*.

Dispersing simplicity to make vessels,
returning to its origin is the most pure—
losing the Dao, then virtue/power—
its end is vulgar and refined.
Thus, benevolence is not innate nature,
righteousness is not spontaneous,
trust does not come from the heart,
propriety is mere external ornament—
right and wrong, war and contention,
deceit and cunning in confusion—
fathers and sons lose the heart of filial piety,
rulers and ministers stray from the Way of loyalty and righteousness—
thus the great Sage, Laozi, lamented the times,
the great error of the age,
the collapse of the highest Dao—
desiring to suppress the latter and exalt the former,
to still the vulgar and return to the pure—
hence he raised the *Great Man’s* conduct in governing the state and managing the family,
in cultivating the self and establishing practice—
discarding superficial rituals,
returning to the true Dao.

**Chapter 39**
Those ancient who attained *Oneness* (一):
Heaven attained *Oneness* to become clear,
Earth attained *Oneness* to become responsive,
Valleys attained *Oneness* to become full,
All things attained *Oneness* to become alive,
Lords and kings attained *Oneness* to rectify the world.

**Chapter 40**
One is the *Primordial Qi*—undivided, hence called *One*.
Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they draw upon the *Primordial One*.
Though all things are abundant, they rely upon *Purity and Harmony*.
Though lords and kings are noble, they depend upon the *True Dao*.

Thus, Heaven is clear and vast in its coverage,
Earth is tranquil and thick in its bearing,
Transformation is refined and spiritual,
Vacuity is expansive and full,
Peace and ease preserve all life,
Non-action establishes rectitude—
how is this achieved?
All attain *Oneness* through the Dao.

In its attainment,
the Dao knows no rise or fall,
yet things gain or lose.
Those who attain it grow ever stronger,
those who lose it decline ever more.
Heaven, without clarity, would fear to crack,
Earth, without tranquility, would fear to erupt,
Spirit, without vitality, would fear to fade,
Valleys, without fullness, would fear to dry,
All things, without life, would fear to perish,
Lords and kings, without nobility, would fear to fall.

The *True One* Dao must not be lost.
Lost, it brings fear of ruin—
to form, fear of disturbance,
to mystery, fear of extinction,
to emptiness, fear of exhaustion,
to life, fear of annihilation,
to nobility, fear of downfall.

Thus, nobility finds its root in humility—
a kingdom’s foundation lies in its people,
for even the highest rise from the lowly.
Nine-tiered towers begin with piled earth.
Hence, lords and kings call themselves *"Lonely, Few, and Without Grain"*—
*"Lonely, Few, and Without Grain"* are the humble titles of kings,
lest they forget their roots.
Is this not taking humility as root?
No—it is saying that true nobility stems from humility.

Thus, one earns *countless praises* without praise,
for kings who are truly noble yet name themselves humble—
these are the Dao-bearing rulers.
Songs and odes praise their virtue, yet they do not claim renown—
this is *countless praise*.
To heed slander and accept counsel, yet not take it as blame—
this is *countless reproach*.

The enlightened gentleman transcends external honor and disgrace,
unshaken by gain or loss,
his heart forgets praise and blame,
his joy and anger do not show on his face.
He does not desire to gleam like jade,
nor to be rough like stone.
Jade gleams but is rare, hence noble,
stone is rough but common, hence low—
the lowly are despised, the noble are fit to govern,
yet neither brings true ease.

To hold nobility with humility,
to dwell in humility without craving equality—
to attain *One* and abide in *Middle*—
only then is there no unease, whether high or low.

**Chapter 41**
The superior man, hearing the Dao,
strives to practice it with diligence;

**Chapter 40**
The Dao moves through *returning*,
its power lies in *weakness*.
The Dao employs softness and weakness,
its actions all reverse convention—
to hold firmness in the heart is to lose the Dao.
All things arise from *Being*,
*Being* arises from *Non-Being*.
*Being*—Heaven and Earth take form, hence called *Being*.
Heaven covers, Earth bears, and things thereby live—
thus, they arise from *Being*.
*Non-Being*—the Dao has no form,
its essence is pure and void, hence called *Non-Being*.
Heaven and Earth follow the Dao to take form,
thus *Being* arises from *Non-Being*—
hence, *voidness* is the root of Heaven and Earth,
*Non-Being* is the source of all things.

The confused lose the Dao,
not recognizing the origin.
The Sage teaches, clarifying the beginning—
if one transcends life and death, entering *Non-Being* and *Being*,
then the deluded, lost in *Being* and *Non-Being*,
are bound to life and death.
Form and spirit unite to manifest—
thus, they arise from *Being*.
Form and spirit scatter, leaving no substance—
thus, *Being* arises from *Non-Being*.

The faithful in the Dao grow ever more steadfast,
strengthening their resolve with unwavering will.
Through shifting seasons, their resolve remains unshaken,
though gold and stone may melt, their integrity stands firm—
beginning and end, ever constant,
unshaken as the mountains.

This is the virtue of diligent practice.

The middling scholar hears the Dao,
now grasping, now losing it—
like unspun silk, shifting hues with every whim.
The middling scholar is unstable,
their heart swaying with desire and aversion.

When they encounter true Dao,
they preserve life to secure the realm,
yet cling to Dao while forgetting the common way.
When they see wealth and beauty,
they indulge their nature to gratify their passions,
yet cling to the common way while losing heart and Dao.

The lesser scholar hears the Dao and laughs.
Their mind is clouded by gain and loss,
knowing the near but not the far,
their senses dulled to truth and falsehood,
their understanding shallow—
they delight in petty virtues of the dusty world,
yet mock the vast, empty Way.

Not to laugh is not the Dao.
The Dao is profound and mysterious—
the lesser fool’s difficulty to grasp.
Its subtlety and penetration
are beyond the dull to recognize.
Now they laugh, yet cannot make the true mingle with the impure—
only to reveal the Dao’s purity and distance.

Thus it is said:
Human hearts are not one,
their choices vary with their wills.
The Sage establishes teachings—
without teaching, yet teaching all—
for common hearts turn toward or away,
some believing, some not.

Clarity like darkness,
wisdom without bounds—
this is illumination.
Shining without glare—
this is darkness.

Diligent practice advances,
yet great attainment seems incomplete—
this is retreat.

The Way of equality is like uniformity—
level and equal, this is the Way of equality.
Harmonizing light with dust,
this is uniformity.

Great virtue is like a valley—
it contains all things.
Great brightness is like shame—
modest yet unstained, this is great brightness.
Mingling like impurity,
this is shame.

Broad virtue seems insufficient,
great fullness seems empty.
Established virtue seems petty—
hidden practice, subtle influence.
True substance seems petty—
*petty* means transformation.
Nature knows no purity or impurity,
essence remains ever true—
this is true substance.
Transcending life and death,
embracing transformation—
this is petty.

The greatest square has no corners—
the cosmos encompasses forms,
yet the Way has no shape.
The greatest vessel matures late—
accumulated habit becomes natural,
beauty ripens with time—
thus, cultivating heart and practice
cannot be achieved in a single day.

Great sound is rare—
the bell chimes in response to rhythm,
the Mysterious Teaching acts in accordance with circumstances.

The greatest form has no shape—
the Dao is hidden, nameless.
The void encompasses all forms—
thus, it is called the greatest form.
Without shape, it is formless.
Unseen, the Dao is hidden.
Beyond all names, it is nameless.

Only the Dao
can generously bestow life.
Advancing yet appearing to retreat—
this is no advancement.
Retreating yet advancing—
this is retreat.
Clarity like darkness—
this is not clarity.
Darkness like clarity—
this is not darkness.

The supreme truth of the Dao
is neither advance nor retreat,
neither clarity nor darkness—
without color, without sound,
without form, without name.

Though nameless, what name cannot stand?
Though formless, what form cannot be seen?
Thus, it breathes *qi* and transforms,
bestowing life upon all things,
acting yet not relying on itself,
entrusting to the natural order.

---
**Chapter 42**
The Dao gives rise to *Oneness*—
the void stirs with *qi*, hence the Dao gives rise to *Oneness*.
Before *qi* divided, it was called *Oneness*.
*Oneness* gives rise to *Twoness*—
clear and turbid separate, yin and yang take form.
*Twoness* gives rise to *Threeness*—
the interplay of two *qi* forms the three essences.
*Threeness* gives rise to all things.
The round heaven covers above,
the square earth bears below,
and the sovereign governs between—
what thing cannot arise?

All things embrace yin while holding yang,
harmonizing *qi* to achieve balance.
Yang *qi*, hot and solitary, cannot give life,
yin *qi*, cold and lone, cannot form shape—
thus, they rely on the Great Dao to connect them,
borrowing harmonizing *qi* to balance them,
and so they live.

What humans despise are the solitary, the orphaned, the childless—
yet kings and nobles name themselves thus.
They embrace harmonizing *qi*,
neither liking nor disliking.
Losing the Way of *Oneness*,
they love and they hate.
They only cherish the names of wealth and nobility,
yet shun the titles of solitude and want.

Only the Dao-abiding sovereign
humbles themselves to govern,
practicing modesty and retreat as their name.

Thus, some things are diminished yet gain,
others gain yet are diminished.
To be called solitary and orphaned with wealth and nobility—
this is diminution.
To renew oneself daily in humility—
this is gain.
Without virtue in high station,
self-deception is thought gain.
Low talent in high rank
must lead to ruin—
this is diminution.

What humans teach,
I also teach as my principle.
Human teachings in the world
rest on reason and righteousness,
yet rigidity and strength are the path of death,
while reason and righteousness are the adornments of the Dao.
I teach as my principle
to move away from rigidity and embrace softness,
to distance from reason and righteousness while securing virtue and the Way.

It is said the Sage teaches all beings appropriately,
adapting to what is taught.
*Principle* means *appropriateness*.
The rigid and overbearing
do not die as they should—
I will make them my teachers.

Those who disobey their parents and sovereigns,
who defy the Sage’s teachings,
who cling to glory and victory,
who exalt themselves over others—
these are the rigid and overbearing.
They violate laws, cut short their years,
dying prematurely in their prime—
this is not true death.

All things conform to the Dao;
the Sage teaches without exception.
When human hearts stray from reason,
the Transforming Sovereign speaks.
Through the adornments of reason and righteousness,
the reality of virtue and the Way is revealed.
Through the nature of rigidity and overbearing,
the laws of softness and weakness are enacted.
The parent is the root—
rigidity is made the root of teaching.

---
**Chapter 43**
The softest in the world
overcomes the hardest in the world.
The softest with form is water—
the softest without form is the Dao.
Water, though soft, can dissolve metal and pierce stone,
breaking the strongest.
The Dao, though soft, can honor the self-forgetful,
breaking rigid fixation.

If one can reflect upon water,
embody the Dao,
penetrate the distinctions of self and other,
test it against hills and mountains—
its subtlety and penetration
know no obstruction—
this is called overcoming the hardest.

**Chapter 44**
What cannot enter the void?
Water knows no obstruction.
The Dao has no form.
With or without gaps,
It enters everywhere.
Thus, one knows the benefit of *wuwei*.
The Dao, formless, yet all things are formed.
The Sage acts without doing—
and all beings are transformed.
This is the benefit of *wuwei*.
Teaching without words,
the benefit of *wuwei*—
yet before, we spoke of *wuwei*’s benefit,
but now we ask: what is *wuwei*?
Practice teaching without words—
and teaching forgets words.
Follow natural course—
and affairs dissolve into nothing.
I rest above, the ministers delight below—
this is the true benefit.

Few attain it in the world.
Those who act with doing are many;
those who attain *wuwei* are few.

Which is dearer—name or body?
Which is more—body or wealth?
Which is more harmful—gain or loss?
Names are external praise.
Wealth is the world’s silk and cloth.
The body is the root of loyalty and filial piety,
the foundation of virtue.
One must abandon external fame and profit,
preserve the body and spirit,
return to *wuwei*,
cultivate the Supreme Way—
yet those who weaken and lose do not return,
those who chase desires lose their true nature,
and thus name kills the body,
wealth harms the self.
Many are lost in delusion.
The Sage pities them,
and so asks in detail:
Is gain beneficial or harmful?
Is losing name or profit harmful?
The vulgar take gaining name and profit as good—
yet gaining them brings death.
Losing them is evil—
yet losing them brings life.
Who determines gain, loss, harm, or benefit?
Loss is the same as losing.
Thus, excessive love brings great waste—
to seek name and kill the body is great waste.
Hoarding much brings great loss—
to seek wealth and harm the self is great loss.
Knowing contentment brings no shame—
not pursuing external fame keeps one far from disgrace.
Knowing restraint brings no peril—
not scheming against reason for wealth avoids danger.
Thus, one endures forever.
To distance oneself from fame and profit,
to avoid peril and harm—
to govern the realm is to ensure its longevity,
to cultivate the self is to preserve it long.

**Chapter 45**
The greatest completion seems incomplete—
its use never wears out.
The Dao is whole, virtue is complete—
this is called greatest completion.
Though complete, it seems lacking—
yet the great abyss, when drawn from, is never exhausted;
the bright mirror, when reflected in, knows no fatigue—
its use never wears out.

The greatest fullness seems empty—
its use is inexhaustible.
Four directions extend equally, yet all are illuminated;
six pathways reveal no hidden depths—
this is greatest fullness.
Not using illumination as illumination,
not using fullness as fullness—
this is emptiness.
Its use is not constrained by the mind—
thus, it knows no limit.

The greatest straightness seems crooked—
straightness aligns with the Dao.
To follow desire as if bending—
this is greatest straightness.

The greatest skill seems clumsy—
the artisan completes all things—
yet it seems unable—
this is greatest clumsiness.

The greatest eloquence seems inarticulate—
to discuss the heavens and clarify principles—
yet speech dissolves into silence—
this is greatest inarticulateness.

Agitation overcomes cold;
stillness overcomes heat.
Yin and Yang qi alternate in function.
Yang qi is agitated and hot;
yin qi is still and cold.
When yang qi prevails, stillness overcomes agitation—
thus, the sequence shifts, and balance determines victory and defeat.

If greatest completion seems incomplete,
if greatest fullness seems empty—
then there is no excess.
If its use never wears out, never exhausts—
then there is no decline.
No excess, no decline,
no cold, no heat—
it preserves completion without ruin,
forgets victory without defeat.
Clarity and stillness are the norm for the world.
To be swayed by yin and yang’s cold and heat—
this is not clarity.
To be moved by life and death’s flux—
this is not stillness.
The Sage knows life and death do not alter them,
cold and heat do not burden them—
this is clarity and stillness.
Where wheels turn, life and death are both bound.
Without wheels turning, transcending life and death—
this is the norm for the world.

**Chapter 46**
When the Way prevails in the world,
warhorses are turned to manure.
The sovereign follows the Way—
he dismisses the horses of urgent command.
Ministers practice *wuwei*—
they manure the fields of sericulture.
Those who cultivate the True abandon restless emotions—
they manure the body and spirit with virtue and the Dao.
Scholars sever drifting laziness—
they manure the empty heart with learning and letters.

When the Way does not prevail in the world,
warhorses rise in the suburbs.
*Rise* means *arise*.
Without the Way, yet adorned with culture,
specializing in arms and loving war—
four borders bristle with fortifications,
five armies rise—
warhorses arise in the suburbs.

Within, the mind-king is unclear—
the six senses gallop like horses,
through ten thousand scenes—
gain and loss clash,
right and wrong contend.
No guilt is greater than desire,
no calamity greater than discontent,
no blame worse than grasping what one desires.
Those who follow the Way abandon emotion and desire—
calamity is removed.
The unenlightened indulge their nature, follow their hearts—
disaster and blame arrive.

Good accumulates as blessing—
both hidden and manifest enjoy it.
Evil accumulates as calamity—
both living and dead bear it.
Punishment stops at oneself—
this is guilt.
Extending to descendants—
this is calamity.
Misleading ancestors—
this is blame.

The contentment of contentment—
always content.
To remove desire is to seek nothing externally—
to purify nature is to lack nothing internally—
thus, knowing contentment,
every action aligns with the Way,
every matter is perfectly fulfilled.
Without a time of lack—
always content.

**Chapter 47**
Without leaving the door,
one knows the world.
Observing through the Dao—
principles are without limit.
Illuminating with wisdom—
affairs are without unknowns—
this is called knowing without traveling.

Without peering through the window,
one sees the Way of Heaven.
Two luminaries adorn the sky,
five stars shine in the Han—
why peer through the window
to begin seeing inner clarity?
Peering through the window—
this is probing and forcing meaning.
The Way of Heaven—
this is the natural order.
Without artificial aids, one catches fish and rabbits;
without labored teaching, one awakens to ultimate truth—
this is not peering through the window to see the Way of Heaven.

The farther one goes,
the less one knows.
Circumnavigating the cosmos,
yet unaware of mountains and rivers;
traversing all scriptures,
yet unaware of ultimate truth—
this is called ignorance.

「Thus, the Sage does not act yet acts—
this is called solitary awakening.
Not seeing yet naming—
this is called profound insight.
Not doing yet achieving—
this is called spontaneous alignment.

**Chapter 48:**
The pursuit of learning brings daily increase—
adding to it with scrolls and volumes,
lengthening it with sights and sounds,
profiting it with fame,
and entangling it with cravings and desires.
The pursuit of the Dao brings daily diminishment—
walking the unsaid teaching,
forgetting both form and principle.
Embodying the void and subtle Dao,
discarding both self and other.
In doing nothing, one loses a hundred doings;
in having no affairs, one abandons ten thousand affairs.
Why should one only discard arrogance and excess?
Diminish again and again,
until one reaches the state of doing nothing.
Abandoning possession to return to emptiness—
this is the diminisher.
Possession gone, forgetfulness remains—
this is again the diminisher.
Possession gone, emptiness remains.
The principles merge in true stillness,
reaching the ultimate state of doing nothing.
Doing nothing yet doing all things—
this is the Dao of non-doing.
Those who hear of non-doing
stand stiffly, palms clasped,
taking cold ashes for the Great Dao,
and clods of earth for the ultimate mind.
Fearful they may be sealed in rigid non-doing,
unable to transcend and dissolve,
hence it is said: *Doing nothing yet doing all things*.
Not doing is not true non-doing;
doing yet returning to non-doing—
this is not doing.
This is the state where both learning and Dao are forgotten,
where only movement and stillness,
stillness and movement, are both at rest.

To govern the world, one must act without affairs;
when affairs arise,
it is insufficient to govern the world.
*To govern* means to encompass.
If one forgets, there is nothing one does not gather;
if one acts, there are things one can and cannot do.
If one governs with non-doing,
what is absent becomes possible, and what is impossible becomes possible.
If one governs with affairs,
what is absent becomes impossible, and what is impossible remains impossible.

**Chapter 49:**
The Sage has no mind,
using the hearts of the people as his own.
The ruler above has no mind for doing,
letting the people transform themselves naturally.
The Sage has no emotional discrimination,
yet responds to all things in harmony.
The good, I make good;
the not-good, I also make good—
this is called attaining goodness.
If one has a discriminating mind,
there is good and there is not-good,
and one cannot attain true goodness.
Now, having no discriminating mind,
not only is the good made good,
but the not-good is also made good—
good and not-good are both made good,
hence it is called attaining goodness.

The trustworthy, I trust;
the untrustworthy, I also trust—
this is called attaining trust.
*Trust* means to follow.
Since things have their own nature—
some trustworthy, some untrustworthy—
to act means there is following and not-following.
There is following and not-following,
and one cannot attain perfect trust.
Now, the Sage has neither trustworthy nor untrustworthy,
all are trustworthy;
neither following nor not-following,
all are following—
hence it is called Great Following.

The Sage is in the world,
restlessly blending the hearts of the people.
*Restless* means not fixed.
Ordinary minds discriminate—
seeing good and not-good,
trusting and not-trusting.
The Sage is restless and unfixed,
wandering freely with the circumstances,
blending their discriminating hearts,
equalizing their notions of right and wrong.
The people fix their ears and eyes,
the Sage treats them all as infants.
The people cannot govern their emotions with their nature,
so they indulge their hearts in desires,
fix their ears and eyes on sounds and colors,
devote their noses and mouths to fragrances and tastes,
thus becoming befuddled and dim-witted,
deaf and blind by their own doing.
The Sage follows the disease and practices medicine,
adapts to the circumstances and expounds teachings,
follows the heart to save all things,
speaks of self-transformation to transform others—
thus it is said: *I am still as a newborn babe,*
*not knowing sounds and colors delight my ears and eyes.*

**Chapter 50:**
Life and death overlap.
From the hidden to the revealed is called life,
from having to returning to emptiness is called death.
Of those who seek life, there are thirteen;
of those who seek death, there are thirteen.
The nine orifices and four gates make thirteen.
If one can cut off desire, they belong to the life category;
if they indulge recklessly, they belong to the death category.
Human life is the movement toward death’s ground—
thirteen times over.
The reason one flows into death’s ground
is due to the thirteen kinds of transgression.
Why so?
Because of the thickness of life’s life.»

**Chapter 51:**
The Dao gives birth to it,
virtue nurtures it,
things shape it—
who brings it to completion?
The Way flows without obstruction—
where can it not go?
Mysterious virtue moves without hindrance—
what task cannot it accomplish?

Now, if we speak of its functions and applications:
To promote life is to return to the Way,
to nurture is to uphold virtue.
Life and nurturing belong to things,
each with its own form.
When it flourishes but bears no fruit, it is called *nao* (孰);
when life and nurturing are fully realized, it is called *cheng* (成).
Thus, all things revere the Way and honor virtue.
Parents give birth, the heavens and earth shelter—
truly worthy of reverence.
Yet virtue and the Way surpass the恩 of parents,
their功 overshadows that of heaven and earth—
thus, they are worthy of human honor.
The Way is exalted, virtue is noble—
yet no title is bestowed upon them,
for their honor is natural and constant.
Virtue and the Way, when forgotten in emptiness,
are naturally exalted and noble—
not because of titles, but because of inherent respect.

Thus, the Way gives birth, nurtures, sustains, completes, and fulfills—
it nourishes and shelters.
This broadly illuminates the meaning of virtue and the Way in nurturing life.

To advance is to *zhang* (长),
to comfort is to *yu* (育),
to establish is to *cheng* (成),
to perfect is to *nao* (孰),
to provide is to *yang* (养),
to cover is to *fu* (覆).
To give birth without possession,
to act without control,
to grow without domination—
this is called Mysterious Virtue.

Those who claim its功 are not true功,
those who rely on its德 are not great德.
Now, having given birth and nurtured,
not relying, not dominating—
this is the profoundest virtue.

---

**Chapter 52:**
The world has a beginning,
and it is called the Mother of the world.
The Dao is the root of things—
thus it is called the beginning.
Virtue is able to nurture—
thus it is called the Mother.
Having obtained its Mother,
one knows its child.
The Dao and virtue give birth and nurture—
this is the meaning of Mother.
Things arise from the Dao—
the child is thus known.
Having known its child,
one must again guard its Mother—
then one will not perish in life.

A child is born of parents,
and must be filial to its parents;
things arise from the Dao,
and must be guarded by the Dao.
If a child is filial to its Mother,
the Mother is kind to the child—
this harmonizes heaven and earth,
moves the divine,
and nothing is harmed.
If one guards the Dao,
the Dao loves them—
accumulating功 and acting in virtue,
manifesting in both subtle and apparent ways,
nothing is harmed—
thus, it is said one will not perish.

This clarifies the guarding of Mother and child,
the gathering of root and branch.
Those who practice this bring peace to their families and states.

Close the *yue* (兑) and shut the gates—
then one will never labor in life.
Cover the eyes and close the mouth—
external calamities will not arise.
Without fatigue or toil,
all strenuousness is cut off.
Return to the nameless beginning,
and abide in the named Mother—
this is the Way of cultivating oneself.

Open the *yue* (兑) and advance in affairs—
yet one will never be saved in life.
Losing the Dao and stagnating in convention,
abandoning the root and following the branches,
opening the six passions’ *yue* (兑),
unlocking the five desires’ gates—
though one completes burdensome deeds,
one will ultimately lose the Way of *wuwei*.
This body will perish,
and salvation will be difficult.

To see what is small is called *ming* (明),
to use softness is called *qiang* (强).
When calamity first arises, it is small—
to foresee and prevent it is *ming*.
To follow the Dao without resistance is softness,
to remain unharmed from beginning to end is *qiang*.

Use its light,
and return to its *ming* (明).
Avoiding bodily harm,
wisdom illuminates the mechanisms—
using this to prevent calamity is its light.
Seeing what has not yet sprouted,
brightly without loss,
inner vision returns to its *ming*—
thus, one does not suffer bodily harm.

This is called **clinging to constancy**.

To indulge passions and exhaust desires,
to abandon the root and follow the branches—
calamity and difficulty will come,
and one will return to the **Wu Chang** (無常).

Block the *yue* (兑) and close the gates,
guard the Mother and return to the beginning,
purify the body and enter the Dao—
this is clinging to **Zhen Chang** (真常).

---
**Chapter 53**
If I but knew the Way,
to walk the Great Dao,
I would tremble with reverence.

The Sage laments the age’s kings,
who do not follow the level path,
but tread perilous roads instead—
wearing ornate robes yet girding sharp blades,
disdaining food while hoarding wealth.
Fields lie fallow, granaries stand empty—
these are the ways of **thieves and the boastful**,
not the pure and true conduct.

If I but knew governance,
I would walk the Great Dao of *wuwei*,
never straying into the petty paths of action.
Any deed undertaken,
I would fear most to fail in doing.

The Great Dao is most level,
yet men love the byways.
The straight path is smooth and easy,
the crooked path steep and hard.
Rulers often tread the difficult,
while those cultivating the self rarely follow the easy.

**Reject the un-Dao.**

Morning’s halls are cleared,
fields lie overgrown.
Elaborate walls and towering halls—
old structures torn down, new ones raised.
Commoners hinder the farmers,
good land left to rot.
Pursuing names and profits,
they discard the little for the much.
Daoic cultivation neglected,
the **Dan Tian** left barren.

Granaries stand empty.
When harvests are bountiful, stores are full,
but when farming is neglected, granaries empty.
When governance is shallow, virtue is hollow,
but when virtue is full, the Dao is real.

Wearing ornate robes,
girding sharp blades—
abandoning simplicity for adornment,
valuing force over culture.
Those who cultivate the True
do not dwell within morality externally,
but only adorn themselves with ritual and decorum,
their hearts poisoned by superficiality,
girded with blades.

Disdaining food,
yet hoarding wealth—
He who eats without taste,
drinks to harmony and bathes in virtue.
He who acts without action,
honors the worthy and loves the virtuous.
Despising coarse fare,
finding joy in simple meals,
dispersing wealth,
treasuring non-greed as his jewel—
this is inner and outer perfection.

Yet they glut on delicacies,
pile up pearls and jade—
these are the ways of **thieves and the boastful**,
not the foundation of family or state.

This is called **thieving and boasting**.
Thieving and boasting are not the Dao.
Taking what is not enough to accumulate excess—
this is theft.
Loving adornment, indulging greed—
this is boasting.
Only theft and boasting
are not the Dao’s conduct.

---
**Chapter 54**
Well-planted, it cannot be uprooted;
well-embraced, it cannot slip away.
Ancestral sacrifices will never cease.

If one establishes conduct in the realm of the **Ultimate Dao**,
its roots will be deep and unshaken.
If one nurtures virtue in the land of **Mystic Power**,
its stem will be firm and unbroken.
For a state, this means eternal ancestral halls;
for a family, unending ancestral rites.

The lineage of teachers and disciples
is woven in **True Qi**,
passed down like echoes in the **Mystic Wind**.

Cultivate for the self—virtue becomes true;
cultivate for the family—virtue overflows;
cultivate for the village—virtue endures;
cultivate for the state—virtue flourishes;
cultivate for the world—virtue is universal.

The Dao must be cultivated,
virtue must be established.
To establish virtue and cultivate the Dao
is to shape the family and govern the state—
wherever one goes, there is no instability.

Unchanging through life and death is called **True**,
blessings extending to descendants is called **Overflow**,
near and far in peace is called **Enduring**,
all things acting naturally is called **Flourishing**,
benevolence without omission is called **Universal**.

Thus, observe the self to know the self,
observe the family to know the family,
observe the state to know the state,
observe the world to know the world.

The source of the **Ultimate Dao** is truly
neither good nor evil.
The beginning of establishing virtue
requires knowing right and wrong.
He who knows wrong will soon abandon evil,
he who knows right will fear not acting in virtue.

Discerning falsehood and truth,
illuminating presence and absence—
the cultivated self returns to **True**,
the uncultivated self falls into **False**.

The cultivated family has **Overflow**,
the uncultivated family lacks.
The cultivated village endures,
the uncultivated is brief.
The cultivated state flourishes,
the uncultivated is impoverished.
The cultivated world is universal,
the uncultivated is deficient.

How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

How does one know that the cultivated thrive
while the uncultivated perish?
Observe one self, and a hundred can be known;
observe one state, and ten thousand are revealed—
how much more so than the Three Dynasties!

---
**Chapter 55**
The depth of **embracing virtue**
is like that of an infant.

Nurturing the Dao and embracing virtue,
accumulating conduct deeply,
qi focused and firm,
desires severed, no greed—
the pure child remains undispersed,
like an infant.

Poisonous creatures do not sting,
ferocious beasts do not seize,
grasping birds do not strike.

*"Sting"* is with poison,
*"seize"* is with claws,
*"strike"* is with talons.

An infant is unharmed
because first, there is no poisonous intent within,
and second, a loving mother protects them—
thus, they are not injured.

One who embraces virtue,
having no wicked heart,
and with Heaven’s grace descending as aid,
thus poisonous creatures cannot spread their venom,
nor ferocious beasts unleash their fury.

Though bones are weak and sinews soft,
their grip is firm.

An infant’s sinews and bones are weak,
yet their grasp on the thumb is unyielding—
not by strength alone,
but because the mind is focused;
though others try to pry it open,
they cannot.

One who embraces virtue
bends the body to follow things,
softens the heart to conform to the Dao—
what is desired cannot pry them open,
their True Nature remains naturally firm.

Unknowing the union of male and female,
yet the **Thunder of the Ancestor** resounds—
the essence is most refined.

The union of male and female is the **confluence of Yin and Yang**.
*"Thunder"* refers to the infant’s **Yin**,
*"resounding"* is movement.
An infant, unaware of male-female rites,
yet moving—
their essence is undispersed to its utmost.

When essence scatters, the body withers;
when the body withers, life ends.

One who embraces virtue
rejects emotional desires and cherishes their essence,
avoids exertion and treasures their qi.

Without intent in movement,
movement does not disturb stillness;
emptying the self in stillness,
stillness does not disturb movement.

Stillness does not disturb movement,
though moving, it is not moving;
movement does not disturb stillness,
though still, it is not still.

Beyond motion and stillness—
the essence is most refined.

To cry all day yet not exhaust the *Ge* resonance—
this is the ultimate harmony.

When weeping ceases without sound, it is called *ge*.
An infant who cries ceaselessly at dawn and dusk,
yet whose voice does not *ge*—
their harmonious qi remains undispersed.

One who embraces virtue speaks of the Mysterious without fatigue,
flows the Law’s sound without interruption—
this is the result of embracing the Supreme Harmony.

To know harmony is to know the Constant,
to know the Constant is to know Clarity.

To lose essence and deplete qi is to return to the Unconstant;
to know harmony is to preserve the True Constant.

One who embraces virtue, having grasped the principle of harmony,
understands the inherent nature of the human body—
nothing in existence is beyond reach—
thus they are called *Clarity*.

To nurture life is called *auspicious*,
to let the heart direct qi is called *strength*.
*Auspicious* means *good*,
*strength* means *flourishing*.

Yet those of the vulgar world, bound by artificial pursuits,
cannot match the infant’s firm grasp of the natural,
nor emulate the one who embraces virtue in knowing harmony.
They chase desires and lose their essence,
exert force and harm their qi.
They nourish life with flavors,
supplement qi with medicines—
their hearts command qi to flourish without decline,
their bodies to remain unblemished—
how could this be attained?

Thus it is said:
All know goodness as goodness,
yet evil has already begun.

When things reach their peak, they age—
this is called *not the Dao*,
and *not the Dao* perishes early.

When things reach their limit, they reverse;
when the body is at its height, it decays.

At this stage, the burdens of worldly dust—
how could they align with the Constant Way of emptiness and stillness?

The Venerable Lord laments that sentient beings do not comprehend the Constant,
cannot receive qi,
and through artificial nourishment,
gain only loss.
Having strayed from ultimate truth,
he warns them to cease such folly.

**Chapter Fifty-Six.**

The wise do not speak,
those who grasp meaning forget words,
those who awaken abandon teachings.
Those who speak do not understand.

Much speech brings loss of the Dao,
clinging to teachings brings loss of truth.

Block the mouth,
close the gate.
Cut off the path of desire,
sever the source of calamity.
Dull the sharp,
resolve the wrathful.
Break the edge of greed,
release the quarrels of right and wrong.

Blend one’s brilliance,
harmonize with the dust—
this is called *Mysterious Unity*.
To contend over gain and loss is sometimes right, sometimes wrong;
to compete over right and wrong is either this or that.

Now, blending brilliance brings no knowledge, no distinction,
harmonizing with dust shares in foolishness without separation,
unifying all things in equal measure—
what law could differ from others?

Thus, one cannot be too close, cannot be too distant;
cannot be too beneficial, cannot be too harmful;
cannot be too noble, cannot be too base.
Therefore, one is noble for all under Heaven.

When Heaven has near and far, distinctions of closeness and distance arise;
when gain and loss are held, harm and benefit emerge;
when high and low are fixed, nobility and baseness are established.

Now, resolving wrath, dulling sharpness,
blending brilliance, harmonizing with dust,
balancing love and hatred equally—
closeness and distance cannot penetrate,
praise and blame are unified,
harm and benefit cannot interfere,
honor and disgrace are forgotten,
nobility and baseness have no means to take hold.
Those who can act thus
may be noble for all under Heaven.

**Chapter Fifty-Seven.**
To govern with *Dao* and order the state,
to nourish the people—
its subtlety lies in balance.
To spread virtue and transform customs—
its essence returns to uprightness.
This is what is called:
The feudal lords and ministers guiding virtue, aligning rites—
the cultivation of culture and teaching.

To employ the *unconventional* in warfare,
the *unconventional* is deceit and transformation.
Facing danger, controlling change—
warfare knows no surfeit of deceit.
Three stratagems, six unconventional tactics,
nine governance principles, a hundred victories—
the supreme general’s stillness extinguishes rebellion,
his martial prowess pacifies the land.
To take all under Heaven with *non-action*.

The enlightened ruler’s transformation of all under Heaven—
when discussing *Dao* and spreading virtue, he is the worthy minister;
when upholding principles and punishing rebellion, he is the renowned general.
Seated in court with the myriad states in attendance,
his ears sealed, his spirit concentrated in the nine palaces.

How do I know all under Heaven is thus?
By this.
How do I know that *non-action* can take all under Heaven?
As the following text states:
*"I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;
I take no action, yet the people grow rich."*

All under Heaven abounds in taboos,
yet the people grow ever poorer.
Taboos multiply, governance becomes intricate and secretive.
The intricate exhausts the people, the secretive fills them with fear.
Following laws hinders livelihood—
how could they not grow poor?

When people abound in clever tools,
the state grows ever more confused.
Cunning strategies should not be widely given,
weapons should not be in every home.
If weapons fill the home, thoughts turn to banditry;
if cunning is widely held, fear of chaos arises.

When people abound in cleverness,
strange things proliferate.
Excessive cleverness breeds strange creations.
The ruler indulges in novelties, the people’s desires rise.
When rare and beautiful things become lawful,
thieves multiply.
When gold and jade are prized,
bandits arise.
It is also said:
Laws meant to suppress theft instead breed more theft;
rites meant to order chaos instead foster more chaos.

Thus the Sage says:
*"I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;
I take no action, yet the people grow rich;
I love stillness, yet the people become upright;
I abandon desire, yet the people return to simplicity."*

The four ills of *having-doing* above—
thus the Sage speaks of the four remedies of *non-doing*,
desiring to eliminate chaos, attain transformation,
remove movement to achieve stillness,
bring peace to the home and joy to the customs,
*non-action* and *non-doing*.
To entrust to the natural course is called *transformation*,
all know it as *wealth*,
without bias is called *upright*,
abandoning ornament to dwell in substance is called *simplicity*.

**Chapter Fifty-Eight.**
When governance is serene and unhurried,
the people are sincere and pure.
When governance is broad,
the people are joyful.
When the ruler is tranquil and still,
the people are simple and unified.

When governance is scrutinizing and rigid,
the people grow deficient and lacking.
When governance is hasty and burdensome,
the people grow weary and impoverished.

Calamity is the foundation of fortune;
fortune is the seed of calamity.
*Foundation* means *use*;
*seed* means *hidden*.

It is said:
When people suffer, they long for joy,
and turn from evil to good.
Through calamity, fortune is attained—
if one indulges in joy, ruin follows.
When in nobility, if one grows arrogant,
calamity lies hidden within fortune.

Who knows its limits?
The causes of good and evil yield the fruits of fortune and calamity,
the cycles of suffering and joy—
who knows their coming and going to their end?

There is no fixed *upright*.
The *upright* becomes *unconventional*,
the *good* becomes *evil*.
*Unconventional* means *strange*;
*evil* means *perverse*—
the deeds of good and evil returning in cycles—
are these not all deviations?

Only in stillness does the true origin stand upright,
for people accumulate much dust and filth in their deeds,
few possess a foundation of purity and emptiness.
Thus it is said: *"There is no fixed upright."*

Those who follow the *upright* are few,
those who set their own commands as *upright* are many.
The *upright* is not always *upright*—
suddenly it transforms and becomes strange,
thus it is called *unconventional*.
All act in evil, unwilling to cultivate good,
yet even if they pretend to do good,
good is not constantly good—
it soon returns to evil.
Thus it is called *perverse*.

The people’s delusion has lasted long.
Deluded by the source of calamity and fortune,
bewildered by the paths of deviation and uprightness—
this is not a matter of days or nights,
but a long-standing habit.

Thus the Sage is square yet does not harm,
*square* meaning *upright*,
*harm* meaning *injury*.
Deviant conduct injures both self and others,
the *Dao* of uprightness harms neither.

He is frugal yet not defiled,
for common emotions are greedy and turbid,
the Sage’s *Dao* is frugal and pure.

He is straight yet not overbearing,
for great straightness seems to bend,
not openly displaying the upright to others.

He shines yet does not dazzle,
for the bright *Dao* appears dim.

Having marked the errors of gain and loss in governance,
then pointing to the gates of calamity and fortune—
those drowned and bewildered are already many,
those lost in confusion have lingered long.
*Perverse* and *unconventional* bind them in suffering,
*foundation* and *hidden* offer paths of release and salvation.

Thus, frugal yet not defiled—
beginning with the *Dao* of purity and emptiness;
shining yet not dazzling—
only then recognizing the source of benevolence.

Blurring gain and loss—
what calamity, what fortune?
Confounding right and wrong—
who is deviant, who is upright?

Drifting without attachment, without non-attachment,
serene, without *can* or *cannot*.

**Chapter 59: Governing People and Heaven, Nothing Exceeds the *Formula*.**

To govern below among the people,
to serve above in Heaven—
nothing surpasses using the *Dao/Way* as the *formula*.

Only the *formula* allows for early submission.
Using the *Dao/Way* as the *formula*,
things naturally incline to return.
Early submission is called "laying down heavy *virtue/power*."

The *Dao/Way* is light, *virtue/power* is thin—
people do not lean toward what is light.
*Virtue/power* deep and rich,
things themselves submit.
Laying down heavy *virtue/power* means nothing is not conquered.
*Virtue/power* heavy, benevolence profound—
nothing is not overcome.
Conquer, overcome—
to conquer without limit, none know its bounds.
The four quarters submit in homage,
the realm knows no borders—
harmonized with the *Dao/Way*’s mysterious unity,
what limits can there be?
None know its bounds,
yet this is how one can have a realm.
Land without borders,
*virtue/power* without bounds—
only then can one truly establish a home and a state.
That which gives rise to a realm,
can endure forever.
With the *Dao/Way*, the realm is secure;
without the *Dao/Way*, the realm is perilous.
The realm is born of the *Dao/Way*,
the *Dao/Way* is the realm’s mother.
Using the *Dao/Way* as mother,
this is how one endures long.
Thus, the *Dao/Way* of deep roots and firm foundations—
enduring life, lasting vision.

For when roots wither, they are uprooted;
when foundations rot, they fall away.
Now, to govern the realm by taking the *Dao/Way* as root—
then the root is deep.
To cultivate oneself by taking *virtue/power* as foundation—
then the foundation is firm.
A firm foundation ensures enduring life,
a deep root ensures lasting vision.
The *formula* for Heaven and humanity,
the key to state and family.

**Chapter 60: Governing a Great Realm, Like Poaching a Small Fish.**

A small fish, poached gently, does not break.
Break it, and the fish spoils.
Thus it is said:
To govern the realm with excessive interference brings chaos below;
to cultivate oneself with excessive interference scatters one’s essence.
Using the *Dao/Way* to oversee the world,
its spirits are not *divine/numen*.
When a ruler uses the *Dao/Way* to govern below,
the spirits do not manifest their *numen* to harm people.

Not that their *numen* is not divine—
their divinity does not harm people;
Not that their *numen* lacks divine power and does not harm people—
it is because the ruler governs with the true *Dao/Way*,
so that perversity cannot cause harm.
Not that their divinity does not harm—
the sage does not harm.
Not that their divinity and spirits cannot harm people—
but when the sage is above,
his *virtue/power* permeates the hidden and the manifest,
and ghosts and spirits cannot cause harm—
because the sage himself does not harm.

When a person can benefit others,
he himself is not harmed.
Thus, when both do not harm each other,
*virtue/power* flows in reciprocal harmony.
The sage and the spirits—
the two are such,
both able to benefit others,
yet they do not harm each other.
The sage is benevolent and kind,
the spirits are upright and just—
benevolence shines in the open, smooth and radiant;
justice dwells in the hidden, quietly amassing resources.
Both, through their *virtue/power* and grace,
return to the people in reciprocal harmony.

The great realm is the confluence of the lowlands,
the gathering of all under heaven.
*Confluence* means *assembly*.
The sea lies beneath all streams—
a hundred rivers there converge and return.
To govern a state, one must first examine oneself as if deficient,
so that all nations may assemble in harmony.

The confluence of all under heaven is ever victorious through *yin*’s stillness over *yang*.
*Yin* is receptive and still;
*yang* is assertive and active.
Stillness can govern movement,
*yin* can bend *yang*,
thus knowing that humility, submission, and yielding
overcome arrogance and strength.

Therefore, when the great realm humbles itself to the small,
it takes the small;
when the small humbles itself to the great,
it gathers the great.
With humility as *virtue/power*,
one can embrace others.
If one cannot yet be humble and retiring,
one cannot take or gather.

Thus, sometimes one humbles to take,
sometimes to gather—
binding two realms together.

The great realm seeks only to nurture others,
the small realm seeks only to serve.
The great realm further spreads the *Dao*’s noble influence,
the small realm seeks only to revere its transformative *virtue/power*.
The great, through its influence, extends its voice and teachings far;
the small, through its reverence, submits to rites and propriety.
Both fulfill their aspirations,
each attains its desire.
Clothing and cap are one,
institutions and systems align—
yet still, the great may despise the small,
the noble may oppress the lowly.
Thus, the great must truly humble itself.

The *Dao* is the hidden essence of all things,
yet the virtuous do not treasure it.
*Treasure* means *value*.
The *Dao* is formless,
its principle is emptiness and stillness.
Formless, it encompasses all manifestations;
emptiness and stillness, it embraces all movement and growth—
thus it is called the hidden essence of all things.

The virtuous ruler, upright in essence,
can value truth.
The unworthy and foolish, following perversity,
despise the *Dao*—
thus, some treasure it, others do not.

Fine words can earn respect,
actions can elevate others.
Yet one who embodies the *Dao* forgets words;
truthful speech is not merely beautiful.
Elaborate arguments to justify falsehood
cannot truly grasp truth.
Empty words, devoid of substance,
how can they be called the *Dao*?
Flowery speech confuses the people,
decorating falsehood as truth.
Frivolous theories disrupt the people,
turning vice into virtue.
Such words may serve in marketplace transactions—
how can they convey *virtue/power* or embrace the *Dao*?

Those who attain supreme *virtue/power*
forget distinctions of self and other.
Those who awaken to nature
merge into harmonious unity.
How can one exalt oneself while belittling others,
affirm oneself while negating others,
and place oneself above all things?

The unvirtuous—
why abandon them?
The sage’s teachings are established
to enlighten the ignorant;
the wondrous *Dao* spreads far,
perfecting those yet unaware.
To make the unvirtuous virtuous,
to make the ignorant wise—
constantly saving people,
never abandoning any.
Thus, the Son of Heaven is established,
and the Three Ministers are appointed.

In the most ancient times, the pure and simple,
the wise and foolish were equal.
Their bodies did not stray from the *Dao*,
their conduct aligned with nature—
all treasured the *Dao*.

From the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors onward,
things grew corrupt and muddled.
Without a ruler, people could not be guided;
with a sovereign, things could be transformed.
Thus, above, the *scholarly-officials* were appointed to assist the *hands-off ruler*,
below, officials were set to discuss the *Dao*.
They were shown what was good and evil,
admonished with rites,
transforming the unvirtuous,
cultivating pure winds.

Even with jade discs and swift horses as tribute,
it is not as good as advancing this *Dao*.
In ancient times, the *scholarly-officials* first presented jade,
then horses—
thus, “with jade discs before swift horses.”

Those who invert proper order
must be awakened from their delusions.
Those who cling to folly
should be illuminated by wisdom’s measure.
To be the ruler’s inner counselors,
the sovereign’s pillars and arms—
their duty is to rectify evil,
easily propagating *Dao* and teaching.

Yet those who seek fame do not rest in their place,
arbitrarily aiming for improper honors.
Those who crave favor do not act according to the *Dao*,
only seeking high rank.
Arrogance and extravagance bring self-inflicted ruin,
leading to shared danger and destruction—
better to cultivate the supreme *Dao*,
remaining unmoved by honor or disgrace.

Why did the ancients value this *Dao*?
Not to seek and obtain,
nor to escape guilt with punishment.
Thus, it is most precious for all under heaven.

From ancient times to today,
why is this *Dao* so revered?
Because seeking it is not accomplished in a day,
practicing it averts a hundred years of calamity,
secures blessings and fortune,
and severs danger and ruin.
Thus, it is honored by all ages,
valued by both heaven and humankind.

To act without action,
to manage without managing,
to savor without savoring—
to still restless movement,
to concentrate the mind in tranquility.
To abandon excessive affairs,
to empty oneself in naturalness.
To discard desires,
to indulge in the mysterious and subtle.

Great and small, much and little—
to repay resentment with *virtue/power*.
Resentment arises, sometimes great, sometimes small.
Enmity emerges, sometimes few, sometimes many.
Once entangled in affairs,
one is bound by these ties,
and resentment begets resentment without end.
If one returns to the great *Dao* of *wuwei*,
preserves the burdenless naturalness,
abandons this muddled world,
and savors this pure emptiness—
then faults do not arise,
resentment and enmity do not take root—
this is repaying resentment with *virtue/power*.

Difficult arises from easy,
great from small.
The world’s difficult matters
must begin with what is easy;
great affairs must arise from what is small.
*Arise* means *initiate*.
Affairs begin with what is easy to achieve,
then grow difficult.
Things in their growth
also proceed from small to great.
To remove great crimes,
one must first extinguish what is easy.
To eliminate great evil,
one must first curb what is small.
If the roots are cut,
the branches wither of themselves.

Light promises lead to few fulfilled words,
many easy things lead to many difficulties.
Firm speech must be kept—
light promises are empty.
Difficulties arise from committing evil deeds,
life and death become easy to manage.
Unlawful acts
are difficult from beginning to end.
Thus, even the sage finds them difficult—
and so they never arise.

Lightly undertaking evil deeds,
one steps into the causes of guilt.
The sage, wise and insightful,
still finds *action* difficult—
thus, he attains the end without difficulty.

How much more so for the blind and ignorant,
who cannot act with gravity and caution—
how could they hope to escape calamity?

**Chapter 64**
What is settled is easy to uphold,
what has not yet manifested is easy to plan.
*Settled* means stillness,
*Unmanifested* means the mechanism remains unstirred.
Disasters are prevented,
evils are stopped before they arise.
To remove evil, restrain it before it moves.
To avert misfortune, hold fast to stillness and tranquility.
If evil omens have no means to arise,
and one does not plot against them, misfortune naturally vanishes—
this is what the superior sage calls preventing disaster.

What is fragile is easy to shatter,
what is subtle is easy to disperse.
Small crimes are easy to extinguish,
long-standing evils are hard to remove.
If one cannot prevent them before they move,
one must restrain them in their fragile, subtle state—
this is how the middle sage eliminates misfortune.

To act before it exists—
this is called "what is settled is easy to uphold."
To govern before chaos arises—
this is called "what is fragile is easy to shatter."

A tree of embrace begins as a hair’s end;
a nine-tiered tower rises from a clod of earth;
a thousand-li journey starts beneath one’s feet.
To act is to court ruin,
to grasp is to lose.
A tree of embrace grows from small to great,
a nine-tiered tower ascends from low to high,
a thousand-li journey proceeds from near to far.

If one governs with stillness,
crimes never sprout from the hair’s end;
if one stops them in their subtlety,
a single basketful of foundation is easily broken.
If one remains motionless and tranquil,
a thousand-li journey will never be completed—
if one cannot act before it exists,
govern before it is disordered,
and persists in artificial doing,
ruin and destruction are inevitable.
Clinging to evil deeds as correct,
one will inevitably meet with loss.
This is called the vulgar failing to act wisely,
leading to ruin and destruction.

Thus, the sage acts without doing and thus knows no ruin,
holds nothing and thus loses nothing.
The common man fails in immediate action,
and thus suffers defeat and loss.
The sage perceives the critical moment in advance,
and thus knows no calamity from action.

Men’s undertakings often fail when nearly complete.
To finish as one begins,
then there will be no failed endeavors.
*Critical* means near—
ordinary men commit evil and cannot remove it early;
when evil is nearly complete,
it is already too late to stop it.
If one can follow the sage’s path,
avoid danger and seek tranquility,
begin without wrongdoing,
and end without guilt,
then there will be neither gain nor loss—
what ruin, what success?

Thus, the sage desires not what others desire,
does not prize difficult-to-obtain wealth;
he learns not what others learn,
but prepares for the errors of the multitude.
Men follow their desires,
holding wealth dear and the Dao cheap.
The sage does not eat,
yet sinks pearls and casts jade as if they were mud—
his cultivation is not for himself,
his learning is for others.
Greed for profit brings error,
contention for fame invites blame.
The sage, having no desires, discards profit,
abandoning learning, forgets fame,
not flaunting his own abilities,
but guarding against the faults of others.
He aids the natural unfolding of all things
without daring to act.
The nature of things
originates from spontaneity—
desire stains true nature with attachment,
learning obstructs the Way with distinctions,
thus obscuring the source of unity,
making the profound Dao hard to reveal.
If one does not enter *wuwei*,
one only returns to ruin and loss.
The sage reveals the original nature of things,
nurtures all beings to preserve their truth,
dares not act artificially,
but guides them back to emptiness and stillness.

**Chapter 65**
The ancients who excelled in the Dao
did not seek to enlighten the people—
they sought to make them simple.
To teach the present age,
one must first invoke the ancients.
The ancients cultivated the Dao to refine themselves and govern the realm,
not employing cunning intelligence to deceive the heart or dazzle the people—
this was not to enlighten them.
They concealed their brilliance like light within a shell,
preserved their purity like uncarved wood,
quieted their discriminating wisdom—
this was to make them simple.

The people are hard to govern
because they know too much.
If the ruler maintains simplicity,
and the subjects return to naturalness,
without resorting to threats or punishments,
they will naturally harmonize.
If one does not practice the empty, tranquil Dao,
but instead relies on clever, deceptive wisdom,
the more one knows, the greater the chaos—
thus, it is hard to govern.

To govern with wisdom is to harm the state;
to govern without wisdom is to benefit the state.
Clever, deceptive wisdom deeply harms the people—
this is the state’s ruin.
Simplicity and naturalness, without knowledge,
allowing things to unfold spontaneously,
each attending to their own affairs,
the people content, families at peace,
harmony between self and other,
ruler and subject all at ease—
this is the state’s virtue.

Know these two paths as models.
To always know these models
is called profound virtue.
Profound virtue is deep and distant,
contrary to the ways of the world—
only then does one attain the greatest harmony.
To use wisdom or not to use wisdom—
these are two paths.
Using it brings harm,
not using it brings no injury.
To know that the people suffer no harm—
this is the model for governing the state.
To know the model,
to establish the foundation of the state and ensure its peace—
this is the subtlety of virtue.

Virtue’s subtlety is unfathomable—*deep*,
its pursuit cannot be attained—*far*.
All men use wisdom,
but this one uses simplicity—
learning to invert with the world.
Not opposing the nature of things,
letting them unfold naturally—
this is the greatest harmony.

It is also said that the Dao originates from emptiness and profundity,
while the world defiles it with filth.
To conform to the world in seeking the Dao
loses one to its falsity,
but to invert the world in cultivating virtue
enters one into its subtlety.
To enter subtlety is to have neither what may nor may not be,
to return to truth is to have neither what is communicated nor what is not.
Since its response is empty and boundless,
it attains great harmony and equality.

**Chapter 66**

The rivers and seas become kings of all valleys
because they excel in yielding.
Thus they become kings of all valleys.

This is a parable.
But the sea dwells in lowliness,
so it becomes the king of all valleys.

It illustrates the Sage’s humility,
making him the sovereign of all nations.

Thus, the Sage wishes to lead the people
by speaking humbly;
wishes to go before them
by placing himself behind.

Thus, though he stands above,
the people do not feel burdened;
though he leads,
the people are not harmed.

To dwell humbly beneath all things is virtue,
so he is exalted as supreme.
To retreat and guide others with the Dao,
he is honored as foremost.

The people willingly bear him as lord,
not feeling oppressed;
all are loyal and filial—
who would dare harm them?

Thus the world delights in promoting him
without tiring of it.
Because he does not contend,
none can contend with him.

Without virtue, all things reject him.
With the Dao, all willingly promote him.
Practicing the customs of yielding and deference,
following the transformations of all things—
who would dare contend with him?

**Chapter 67**

The world all calls me "great"—
I am unworthy.
Only because I am great,
am I unworthy.

If I were worthy for long,
I would be small.

The Old Master’s Dao is exalted and honored,
truly worthy of being great.
Yet he conceals his traces with the common,
his hidden and revealed ways are unfathomable,
not resembling wisdom,
not resembling foolishness—
thus he speaks of being unworthy and unlike.

Only the truly great Sage
has nothing to resemble.

If form has fixed qualities,
wisdom has fixed measures,
if there are things to resemble,
if the Dao has opposites—
these are the petty and fragmented small men.
How could they be the boundless, transcendent Sage?

I possess three treasures;
I hold them fast.
The first is *cì* (慈, kindness),
the second is *jiǎn* (俭, frugality),
the third is *bù gǎn wéi tiānxià xiān* (不敢为天下先, not daring to go before the world).

The vulgar cherish profit,
valuing it with seven treasures.
The Dao rests in truth,
weighting it with the three treasures.

The meaning of the three treasures
is not something sought externally.
If one can be kind to all things,
cherish life and abhor destruction—
this is the meaning of *cì*.

Light taxes and frugal expenditures,
humble bearing and restrained use,
neither extravagant nor ostentatious—
this is the meaning of *jiǎn*.

Forgotten self, aiding others,
retiring to guide—
not daring to go before the world.

Holding fast to these three,
practicing them in conduct,
they bring peace to the state and security to the family—
great treasures indeed.

Kindness makes one courageous;
frugality makes one expansive;
not daring to go before the world
makes one a vessel of completion.

Kindness toward things—
things do not harm you.
Things not harming you—
you have no adversaries before you.
Because you have no adversaries,
you are called courageous.

If used extravagantly,
it is insufficient for affairs;
if practiced frugally,
it suffices for governance—
reaching far and wide,
thus it is called expansive.

Exalted in humility,
guarded in yielding softness,
its virtue is universal,
its humility radiant and ever-renewing,
held in esteem by all things—
thus it becomes a vessel of completion.

Now abandon kindness and courage,
abandon frugality and expansiveness,
abandon humility and going before—
you are dead.

Earlier, those who possessed the three treasures
dwelt in kindness and gained courage,
held fast to frugality and achieved expansiveness,
remained behind and thus became foremost.

Now those who lose the three treasures
cannot practice kindness—
they hastily know courage;
cannot uphold frugality—
they waste without measure;
do not understand humility and going behind—
they eagerly seek to go before others.

To love courage without kindness brings ruin;
to use expansiveness without restraint brings hardship;
to dwell before others without virtue brings danger—
thus it is said: you are dead.

Kindness, when used in battle, conquers;
when used in defense, it is steadfast.
Heaven, about to save it, guards it with kindness.
Using kindness as principle,
it does not lose its Dao.

In battle, it must overcome the enemy—
thus it conquers.
In defense, it faces no collapse or peril—
thus it is steadfast.
With kindness as heart,
the Mysterious Heaven protects it—
thus it is said: Heaven saves it.
The utmost Dao preserves it—
thus it is said: the Dao guards it.

Within, it clarifies right and wrong in conflict as battle,
dispels delusion as victory,
the body does not lose its Dao as defense.
To align with the Dao for long is steadfastness.
Harmony without harm—
Heaven saves it.
Things not injuring it—
the Dao guards it.

**Chapter 68**

The ancients who excelled as warriors
were not martial.
They came to things with kindness,
subdued people with virtue,
did not fight with force,
did not delight in courage—
without action, they transformed—
this is not martial.

Skilled in war but not angry,
able to quell rebellion and chaos—
this is skilled in war.

Saving things with kindness,
not angry.
Skilled in overcoming enemies without contending,
the Dao aids the world—
the four seas come to submit as king.

Virtue soothes within,
the five weapons are not raised.
Things are subdued without blades—
thus it is said: skilled in overcoming enemies.
Without striving, naturally promoted—
thus it is said: no contending.

Skilled in using people as lowly,
ensuring people do not lose their natural forms,
assigning things their proper roles—
this is skilled in using people.

Wide in tolerance, it gains the multitude;
humble, it incurs no blame—
thus it is said: as lowly.

This is called the virtue of non-contention—
this concludes the above: not martial, not angry, yet able to overcome enemies.

This is called using people’s strength—
this concludes skilled in using people as lowly, people exerting themselves for it.

This is called aligning with Heaven—
the ancient ultimate.

Embracing things with the Dao,
attracting the distant with culture.
Conquering without war,
exalted without contending.
Its virtue is vast and great,
approaching Heaven above.
Its transformation is pure and harmonious,
comparable to the ancient extreme.

Within, it clarifies the empty heart and full belly,
sitting-forgetfulness merging with the Dao,
not relying on coercion or authority,
no labor of courage or ferocity—
thus it is said: the ancients who excelled as warriors were not martial.

Erasing the emotions of right and wrong,
removing the prejudices of love and hate,
skilled in war but not angry.
Things do not harm me,
following without resistance—
skilled in overcoming enemies without contending.

The heart-king is tranquil,
the will rests in the void,
ears and eyes undisturbed,
hands and feet unlabored—
skilled in using people as lowly.

In accord with natural principle—
thus it is said: aligning with Heaven.
Contracting the original source—
the ancient extreme.

「Chapter 69: When employing forces, there are words to heed—
drawing from ancient military precepts.

I do not dare to be the **host** but instead the **guest**,
for when within my own land I strike first, I am the host;
when in the battlefield I move first, I am the host.

To strike first and move first is arrogance and excess—
a perilous state.
Now I seek to preserve my whole,
thus it is said: I dare to be the host.

In harmony yet not singing, following yet not leading—
thus it is said: to be the guest.

I do not dare advance an inch only to retreat a foot.
I do not rely on military might to invade externally—
thus it is said: I do not advance an inch.
Yet I rely on **accumulating virtue** to defend internally—
thus it is said: I retreat a foot.

This is called **action without action**—
forces arise from the other.
I truly do not act,
yet respond to things and act without effort,
moving without intent—
**action without action**.

**Repelling without arms**—
anger drives the use of forces,
and this is why one repels with arms.
As the guest, I retreat a foot,
not relying on arms to repel—
thus it is said: **repelling without arms**.

**Holding without forces**—
harming the other without **Dao/Way**,
this is why one holds forces.
Forces are used to still forces,
punishment is meted out to end punishment.
Not yet losing **benevolence and righteousness**,
those who revere the Dao return of their own accord—
there are no forces to hold.

No greater calamity than **insulting the enemy**—
insulting the enemy nearly brings about the loss of my treasure.

To **kill without cause** is not to be done habitually,
though in times of conflict, the Dao values **mystery and stillness**,
thus it is said: **govern things through non-action**,
strive to **settle the people**,
and do not let harm arise.
If one retreats and loses the **Dao of non-action**#27,
or advances without **stillness and subduing forces**#28,
and **lightly insults the enemy**,
the state will collapse and the people perish—
a calamity most dire.

A state with **abundant people and wealth**,
a **sage ruler and virtuous ministers**—
this is called **possessing the treasure**.

When the people perish and the granaries are empty,
when ministers are humiliated and the ruler is in peril—
this is near to losing my treasure.
Thus, when opposing forces are equal,
the **compassionate will prevail**.

Opposing forces are equal when both sides mobilize their troops,
their numbers and strength balanced—
thus it is said: **equal opposing forces**.
To **lightly scorn the enemy** with no preparation,
and to **covet victory yet love killing**—
this is inferior.

**Stillness** must align with the **Dao/Way**,
**action** must follow strict laws,
never losing **benevolence**—
for **benevolence** can govern things,
and thus the **compassionate will prevail**.

Within, one knows **disturbances and afflictions** are manifold,
and they cannot be broken without **wisdom**.
To expound their methods,
thus it is said: **When employing forces, there are words to heed**.

To be the host must be **heroic and strong**,
to be the guest must be **yielding and weak**.
Those who would **still movement and return to stillness**,
knowing to **guard strength with yielding**—
thus it is said: **I do not dare to be the host but instead the guest**.

If one **ignores the Dao/Way** and **obscures it**,
advancing the **Dao/Way** is like retreating—
**learning without true learning**,
**practicing without true practice**—
thus it is said: **I do not dare advance an inch only to retreat a foot**.

Understanding that **all conditions are illusory**,
realizing that **both principles and teachings are empty**—
**action without action**.

Not only are all ten thousand phenomena **empty and tranquil**,
but also the self is **empty and pure**—
**repelling without arms**.

Within, one **forgets wisdom**,
**holding without forces**.

Externally, one **severs emotional attachments**,
and thus has **no enemies**.

**Indulging emotions and extreme desires**,
losing the **Dao/Way** and ruining the self—
this is the loss of my treasure#29.

**Wisdom** and **disturbances**,
these two kinds always follow one.
Opposing forces are equal.

**Skillful means** lie in **wisdom**,
**subtle and unerring** in **compassion and benevolence**,
**leakages exhausted** or **dispelled**,
**serene and free of burdens**—
thus the **compassionate will prevail**.

**Chapter 70: My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice.**
The **sage** establishes teachings,
**concise in words yet profound in meaning**,
illuminating **principles and revealing their significance**—
thus they are easy to know.
**Embrace the One**#30, **free from myriad entanglements**,
**non-action** **severing burdens**—
thus they are easy to practice.

Yet none under Heaven can know them,
none can practice them.
**Common emotions** do not conform to **mysterious teachings**,
**cling to folly** and have not yet opened to **wisdom**,
not recognizing this **Dao/Way**—
thus none can know them.
**Lost in desires**, they do not **habitually practice non-action**,
abandoning **rightness** to follow **evil**—
thus none can practice them.

Words have a **root**,
affairs have a **master**.
**Root** is **foundation**,
**master** is **ruler**.
To take **virtue and power** as the foundation,
its essence is easy to know.
To take **non-action** as the master,
its essence is easy to practice.

Those who **lose the foundation and chase the ends** are many,
not revering the **true root**,
indulging emotions and defying nature—
these are the multitude.
How could they know that the **master** leads all and thus they are as such?
Thus it is said: **None under Heaven can know or practice them**.

For it is only because of **ignorance**,
that they do not know me.
All things are **dark and obscured**,
within, there is not even a **hair’s measure of discernment**—
thus it is said: **ignorance**.
**Lost in principles**, they stray from the **Dao/Way**,
externally, they lack **wisdom in the ten thousand phenomena**—
thus they do not know me.

Few can **truly understand me**,
thus I am **precious to those who do**.
The **busy and laborious**,
what they value is **name**.
Those who **ruin the multitude**,
what they love is **profit**.
Few can **embody the Dao/Way**,
thus it is said: **Few can truly understand me**.

If one **does not return** from ruin,
returning is due to **the right path**;
if one **wanders aimlessly** and does not **return**,
returning is entering **the true source**—
the **Dao/Way**.
Thus the **sage** **wears coarse robes yet holds jade within**—
**conforming to the common** and **mingling with dust**,
externally demonstrating **humble attire**—
**wearing coarse robes**.
**Pure virtue** shines untainted,
**white and radiant**—
**holding jade within**.

**Chapter 71: To know the unknown is superior**;

**Chapter 72: Not knowing what one knows is an affliction.**
To know the empty and the full with wisdom,
To comprehend the true and the mundane with insight—this is *knowing*.
What it illuminates is ever empty,
Its discerning wisdom is ever still—
No knowing, no known, both vanish together,
Illumination and object alike forgotten—this is *not knowing*.
Illuminating yet without illumination,
Knowing yet as if not knowing—
This is the **supreme virtue**.

To force knowing upon *not knowing* brings sickness,
The more one knows, the more one loses—
It harms the body, shortens life—
This is the affliction of knowing.
Thus the sage does not fall ill,
For he treats the affliction as an affliction—
Thus he does not fall ill.
The sage originally abandons knowing—
Thus he does not fall ill.
He pities those who suffer from forced knowing,
For he treats their affliction as an affliction.
He pities the multitude, though they labor in distinctions,
Yet remain unstained by dust—
Thus the sage does not fall ill.
It is also said: *He treats their affliction as an affliction*,
Meaning the multitude is afflicted by the sickness of distinctions—
Thus it is said: *He does not fall ill*.

---

**Chapter 73: The bold who dare are destroyed; the bold who do not dare live.**
Not fearing is courage,
Firmness of heart is daring.
Before the flashing blade, regarding death as life—
This is the courage of the noble.
Yet wisdom is not strategy,
Strength is not mere prowess—
To rush forward for gain
Will surely lose one’s life—
Thus it is said: *destroyed*.
Without contention, one must act with compassion,
Or draw others with virtue and Dao,
Or subdue things with wisdom and strategy—
Harming none, preserving oneself—
Thus it is said: *live*.
Within, daring in voice and color destroys the body,
Not daring in dust and defilement preserves oneself.
These two—one brings harm, one brings benefit—
This is *destroyed* and *live*.

What does Heaven abhor, and who knows its reason?
Heaven’s Dao loves life and abhors destruction,
Yet many cannot follow what benefits and avoid what harms—
This is because they do not recognize Heaven’s intent.

Heaven’s Dao conquers without contention,
Its will is without striving,
Yet naturally it is honored and takes precedence.
It responds without speaking,
It comes without being summoned—
Spring gives way to winter, cold yields to heat,
Those who depart were not sent away,
Those who arrive were not called forth.
Yet it unfolds with perfect design.
The Great Dao is so simple—
Thus it is said: *unfolding*.
It weighs the gains and losses of all,
Its rewards and punishments are precise,
Its judgments of good and evil are without error—
Thus it is said: *perfect design*.
Heaven’s net is vast and wide,
Though sparse, it loses none.
It spreads through the boundless void,
It ensnares the manifest—
Wide and great, thus it is said: *vast*.
Crimes, great or small, are all caught,
No offense escapes, no transgression is overlooked—
Thus it is said: *loses none*.

---

**Chapter 74: If the people do not fear death, how can you frighten them with death?**
When the age encounters the Dao,
All things cherish life,
The times belong to *wuwei*,
And all hold life dear.
If one cannot govern them with supreme virtue,
But instead restrains them with harsh laws,
People have no joy in living—
Thus it is said: *the people do not fear death*.
The people do not fear death
Because punishments are cruel—
One should instead pardon and employ virtue, forgetting laws.
How can you still use harsh measures to govern them,
Seeking to frighten them with death?
This laments the errors of the age.
If one were to act strangely without fear of death,
I would seize and destroy them—who would dare?
*Strange* means deceitful, disorderly, and disruptive.
If the ruler follows the Dao,
All preserve their lives—
This is called *fearing death*.
As for those who forcibly oppress,
Disrupting the order with their crimes,
The more strange and perverse they become,
Heaven does not endure evil—
Thus I seize and destroy them.
Those who fear death naturally avoid transgression,
Who would dare to act wrongly while cherishing life?
There are always those who execute punishment.
*Execute* means *master*—
The officials of life and death have their duties,
They cannot act arbitrarily—
Those who break the law deserve death,
Yet one cannot presume to take it upon oneself.

---

Those who presume to execute punishment in place of the proper officials
are like those who take the place of the master carpenter in hewing.
If one takes the place of the master carpenter in hewing,
one will hardly avoid injury to one’s own hands.

Though the **Dao/Way** of Heaven may seem distant,
its mysterious discernment is most clear.
It rewards the virtuous and punishes the wicked,
manifest in the **Suffering Officials** of the underworld.

Spring brings forth life, summer nurtures its growth,
yet these are entrusted to visible substitutes.
If the governance of the age cannot rely on Heaven’s natural order
but instead substitutes it with human contrivance,
it is already straying from the Dao.

Yet even so, the stubborn few may follow transformation,
while the cunning many are hard to guard against.
Adapting to the times is proper,
and establishing laws to restrain them—
there are always those who enforce punishment,
those who hold authority over life and death.

If one does not entrust punishment to its proper officials,
and does not act through its rightful **masters**,
then those who execute punishment arbitrarily
are like clumsy men taking the place of skilled artisans.
There will surely be injury to their hands,
and few will escape harm—
the injuries will be many indeed.

**Chapter 75**
The people’s hunger stems from their rulers’ excessive taxes,
thus they suffer hunger.
When the common folk are starving and destitute,
when the four classes are burdened and exhausted,
it is not due to other causes—
only heavy taxes and rampant banditry.

The people are hard to govern because their rulers act unnaturally,
thus they are hard to govern.
To act unnaturally is to obstruct the people,
and this is why governance is difficult.
To govern naturally and uprightly,
the people will easily be transformed.

The people’s disregard for death comes from their rulers’ excessive indulgence in life,
thus they hold death lightly.
Those who cling to life weigh their fleeting gains above true virtue,
while those who scorn death drown in false affections.
To take what has life
and nourish a hollow, artificial existence—
this is what is meant by *excessive indulgence in life*.
Excessive means accumulated, means excessive.
When desires accumulate, the mind is disordered;
when pleasures are excessive, the palate grows weary,
and one cannot cherish life with proper reverence to preserve it.
To indulge recklessly and destroy oneself—
this is the path to holding death lightly.

Only those who do not cling to life
are truly able to **honor** life.
To cling to life as something of value,
yet to nourish it beyond its proper measure,
ultimately leads to harm—
this is not yet to **honor** life.

Those who attain the **Dao/Way** see the body as not truly theirs,
who understand the principle of **non-being**,
do not perceive the illusory form of life,
and naturally shed the burdens of false attachment.
They align with the **emptiness** and **purity** of the **Dao/Way**,
sharing the same root of **virtue/power**.
Though they do not cultivate life,
life sustains itself—
this is what it means to truly **honor** life.

**Honor**, here meaning *capable of*.
**Honor**, here meaning *to value highly*.

「Chapter 76: Human life begins in softness and weakness,
yet death manifests in rigidity and strength.
Under heaven, nothing is softer and weaker than **qi**,
and nothing is softer and weaker than the **Dao/Way**.
Thus, when a person is born,
they must draw upon the **Dao/Way** and **qi**.
When **qi** remains, bending and straightening are at one’s own command;
when the **Dao/Way** is present, movement and stillness are governed by **spirit** (*shén*).

The heart follows without resistance,
actions proceed without hindrance,
hence the saying of softness and weakness.
If **qi** cannot be preserved,
its exhaustion brings death to the body;
if the **spirit** is not yet liberated,
its departure means life’s end.
When life’s end comes and the body perishes,
there is no further movement—
hence it is called rigidity and strength.

All things, grasses and trees,
begin life as tender and fragile,
yet in death become withered and brittle.
Sentientless beings—
those with **qi** live, those without **qi** die.
Thus, it is known that among beings with awareness,
those who grasp the **Dao/Way** belong to the category of softness and weakness,
while those who lose the **Dao/Way** fall into rigidity and strength.

Therefore, rigidity and strength are the followers of death,
while softness and weakness are the followers of life.
Binding the above with sentient and sentientless beings,
the two principles of birth and death,
each has its own category of adherents.

Hence, armies grow strong yet cannot conquer,
trees grow strong yet are felled.
Not relying on **virtue/power** but on arms to be strong—
this is violent to all under heaven who love life,
yet hated by all things.
Gathering few to make many,
supporting weak to make strong,
and then attacking together—
there will be those who cannot conquer.

Thus, when a tree grows strong,
its branches and leaves flourish above;
when a pillar grows strong,
its beams and supports are steadied below.
By this analogy, I explain:
to seek **virtue/power** in softness and weakness,
not to adorn oneself with arms for rigidity and strength.
So, rigidity and strength reside beneath,
while softness and weakness dwell above.

Life is what all rejoice in;
softness and weakness are the followers of life—
is this not the highest?
Death is what all grieve over;
rigidity and strength are the followers of death—
is this not the lowest?

Chapter 77: The **Dao/Way** of heaven
is like a drawn bow.
Human affairs are near and shallow,
faced yet their true nature remains unseen;
the **Dao/Way** of heaven is distant and profound,
gazed upon yet its principle cannot be fully comprehended.
The confused cannot know it,
the correct **Dao/Way** is difficult to discern—
thus, I borrow the analogy of the drawn bow.

The high are lowered,
the low are raised,
the excessive are diminished,
the insufficient are supplemented.
The **Dao/Way** of using a bow:
the high fear overshooting,
so they are lowered lest they be too high.
The low fear falling short,
so they are raised lest they be too low.
Neither too high nor too low,
this is the middle—what is expected.

For those who govern a state,
they diminish the excess of wealth,
supplement the lack of poverty.
The poor, though benefited, remain poor,
the rich, though diminished, remain rich.
Neither poor nor rich,
this is the middle in the governance of a state.

Too high risks the emptiness of the void,
so it is lowered lest it be void.
Too low risks stagnation in deficiency,
so it is raised lest it be deficient.
Neither deficient nor void,
this aligns with the middle **Dao/Way**.

The **Dao/Way** of heaven
diminishes the excessive and supplements the insufficient.
I explain the **Dao/Way** of heaven through this analogy.
But human affairs are not so:
they diminish the insufficient to serve the excessive.
This is to say that human actions contradict the **Dao/Way** of heaven,
and cannot diminish the strong to benefit the weak,
nor reduce the rich to augment the poor.
Who can have excess to serve all under heaven?
Only those who grasp the **Dao/Way**.

Who can follow the **Dao/Way** of heaven in their conduct,
diminishing the full to supplement the humble?
Only the **Dao/Way**-aligned ruler can know this.

Thus, the sage acts yet does not rely on it,
achieves yet does not possess—
this is not to value the worthy.
The sage cultivates **virtue/power** without expecting its rewards,
completes things without claiming its merits.
This is so because they wish to conceal their sage **virtue/power**,
and obscure their worthy talents.
Since the highest act thus,
the lowest naturally follow.
The calamity of seeking fame is removed,
the pity of valuing the worthy does not arise.

Chapter 78: Under heaven, nothing is softer and weaker than water,
yet nothing can surpass it in overcoming rigidity and strength—
it cannot be replaced.
Observing all things,
summarizing all existence,
the utmost softness and weakness
is water above all else.
It melts metal and stone,
erodes hills and mounds—
nothing can surpass water,
water is the most victorious.

To overcome rigidity and strength, one must imitate water.
Since it is victorious,
it cannot be replaced.
For those who govern a state,
if they can take humility as **virtue/power**,
and the **Dao/Way** as their method,
they can overcome strong enemies,
subdue the mighty—
and the **Dao/Way** will be the foremost,
thus nothing can replace it.

For those who cultivate themselves,
if they can uphold the utmost **Dao/Way** of softness,
they will naturally break the rigidity and strength of self and others,
and grasp the utmost principle of **emptiness** and **purity**.
They will transcend the disputes of right and wrong.
Only the **Dao/Way** is victorious,
nothing can substitute for it.

Thus, softness overcomes rigidity,
weakness overcomes strength—
this concludes the previous discussion.

Under heaven, none can know it,
none can practice it.
Many love rigidity and strength,
few preserve softness and weakness,
unable to humble themselves,
striving to be first among all things.

Therefore, the sage says:
To bear the state’s filth,
this is called the master of soil and grain;
To bear the state’s misfortunes,
this is the ruler of all under heaven.
Correct words, yet reversed in meaning.
Embodying the **Dao/Way** of softness and weakness,
then all things are contained within.
Understanding the realm of the profound and mysterious,
then all affairs are naturally received.
Suppressing wrongdoing without stifling virtue,
bearing the state’s filth—
blaming oneself and taking responsibility,
bearing the state’s misfortunes—
this is fitting for being the master of all things,
hence the saying: the ruler of all under heaven.

This is contrary to common practice yet in accord with the **Dao/Way**,
thus it is said: correct words, yet reversed in meaning.
Filth (*nòu*) is impurity.
Misfortune (*xiáng*) is virtue.

For those who cultivate themselves,
though they experience impurity and purity,
they forget both purity and impurity.
Though they traverse virtue and vice,
they harbor both vice and virtue equally.
Illuminating the original **emptiness** of a single principle,
realizing that all realms are empty—
this can achieve the **Dao/Way**,
and become the **Dharma King** (*Fǎwáng*).

Common practice regards filth, purity, virtue, and vice
as all having existence,
but observing through the **Dao/Way**,
all are seen as **emptiness**—
hence it is said: reversed.

Chapter 79: Reconciling great grudges
will inevitably leave lingering grudges—
how can this be considered good?
When self and others are equal and unified,
right and wrong do not arise.
When distinctions and conflicts abound,
grudges and enmities naturally flourish.
Thus, ritual has the principle of repaying grudges,
law has the penalty of death for retribution.
Grudges past and present cannot be extinguished,
yet if one seeks to extinguish grudges and reconcile them,
they must eliminate hostility to achieve harmony,
turn wrongdoers to virtue,
and guide them from evil to goodness.

「Yet though one’s words are good and one’s heart is not,
one outwardly complies while inwardly dissenting—
if the heart is not good and compliance is not sincere,
the lingering grudges will only grow worse,
and thus further evil will arise—
how can this be called good?

If one truly seeks to be good,
it is better not to harbor grudges at all.
If one does not harbor grudges,
why must one seek reconciliation and harmony?
Then there is neither hostility nor opposition.
Hostility and opposition forgotten,
grudges and enmities naturally cease.

To not know that goodness is goodness,
only then can it be named **ultimate goodness** (*zhìshàn*).

Thus, the **Sage** (*shèngrén*) holds the **left token** (*zuǒ qìe*—a pledge of trust),
and does not blame others.

In ancient times, the **Sage** carved wooden tokens,
the ruler kept the left half,
the subject kept the right half as a sign of faith.
When the tokens were matched,
no further legal punishment was imposed,
and no blame was given to others.
Hence it is said: **"virtue/power"** (*dé*) governs tokens,
while lack of **"virtue/power"** governs their separation.
**Govern** (*sī*) means **to oversee**; **tokens** (*qìe*) mean **to unite**; **separation** (*chè*) means **to part**.

Where **"virtue/power"** presides,
above it unites with the **Dao/Way** of **non-action** (*wúwéi*—effortless alignment),
blending into a silent, singular harmony,
below it is where all things converge,
the tokens of trust sealed in faith.

If one lacks **"virtue/power"**, unable to act in goodness,
not only does one fail to unite with the **Dao/Way**,
but one also causes **dispersion** (*liú sǎn*) among the masses.
Hence, it is said: **"virtue/power"** governs tokens,
while lack of **"virtue/power"** governs separation.

The **Heavenly Dao/Way** has no favorites,
always aligning with those of **"virtue/power"** (*shànrén*).
The **Heavenly Dao/Way** is balanced and equal,
with no distinction of near or far—
the wicked stray from its path,
thus earning the name **"distant"** (*cū*).
The good draw near to truth,
thus earning the name **"close"** (*qīn*).
**Ultimate truth** (*zhìlǐ*) speaks in plain words,
neither distant nor close—
only when the good act in **"virtue/power"** and goodness
does Heaven bestow its blessings#38,
hence it is said: the **Heavenly Dao/Way** aligns with the good.

Yet it does not align with the wicked—
thus one knows that **"virtue/power"** aids **"virtue/power"**, not those lacking it.
If one can act in **"virtue/power"** and goodness,
then **"virtue/power"** and goodness will naturally return to them.

Chapter 80: In a **small state with few people** (*xiǎo guó guǎ mín*),

though they possess **tenfold and hundredfold implements** (*shí bǎi zhī qì*—tools, weapons, or instruments),
they do not use them...」

The Sage governs the state through the **Dao/Way of non-action**,
and though military implements—whether few or many, tenfold or thousandfold—exist,
they are all unused.
A small state does so; how much more so a great one!

Let people hold death in reverence and not flee far.
When governance has purpose, life becomes light.
When transformation follows **non-action**, all revere death.
Fathers protect their children, wives do not lose their husbands,
each finding joy in their work and dwelling in peace—
no more wandering or fleeing.

Though carriages and boats exist, they are not used.
For what need is there of boats on water?
Or carriages on land?
In the age of **non-action**, mountains lack paths or tunnels,
marshes lack bridges or ferries.
The source cuts off coming and going—
what need is there for riding?

Though armor and weapons exist, they are not deployed.
Weapons are used to punish rebels,
martial might to quell chaos.
When the ruler follows the **Dao/Way**, the people cherish **virtue/power**.
Transformation follows naturally—
what need is there for arraying troops?

Let the people return to using knotted cords for records.
In ancient times, before writing was invented,
knots on cords were used for governance.
Once writing arose, frivolity increased,
and though sages taught, the principle remained **non-action**.
They wished to return to simplicity, discard ornamentation,
and embrace reality.
Let their food be plain, their clothing simple,
their dwellings secure, their customs joyful.
When hearts are content, coarse food and rough garments suffice as delight.
Now the Sage’s transformation surpasses the Great Pivot—
no distinction between noble and common,
all food is savory,
all clothing beautiful,
all dwellings secure,
all homes filled with joy.
No one flees far—
the weak and the dying are naturally cut off.
Neighboring states are visible to the eye,
the sounds of roosters and dogs heard in ears,
yet from beginning to end,
from youth to old age,
they do not visit one another.
Two states as neighbors,
visible to the eye,
roosters crowing, dogs barking—
yet from start to finish,
from young to old,
they do not come and go,
each self-sufficient, each home complete.
Thus it is said:
People forget each other in the **Dao/Way**,
fish forget each other in rivers and lakes—
this is what is meant.

**Chapter 81:**
Truthful speech is not ornate,
ornate speech is not truthful.
Speech reveals the heart—
not for idle fabrication,
but to uphold true principle,
not for empty words.
Thus, truthful speech is not ornate.
Sweet words betray truth,
light promises lack sincerity—
thus, ornate speech is not truthful.

The good do not argue,
arguers are not good.
Great eloquence seems stammering,
without labored words.
The good do not argue.
One-sided speech overreaches,
many words lead to exhaustion—
arguers are not good.

The wise are not learned,
the learned are not wise.
If you know one thing,
all things are complete—
the wise are not learned.
When form overshadows substance,
learning drowns the mind,
true principle is forgotten.

The sun and moon shine their light,
illuminating all peaks,
things gain sight and their brilliance increases—
just as the Sage’s wisdom penetrates all things,
and their teachings extend endlessly.
Rivers and seas nourish all things,
giving life while their source never runs dry—
just as the Sage’s generosity is inexhaustible.

The **Dao/Way of Heaven** benefits without harming,
the **Dao/Way of the Sage** acts without contention.
Heaven’s **Dao/Way** bestows life—
this is benefit.
It always rescues people without harm.
Contention arises from the heart,
action from circumstances.
The Sage has no heart—
thus naturally no action.
When action is none,
**non-action** is also none.

The **Dao/Way** is ever **non-action** yet nothing remains undone.
The **Ultimate Dao/Way** is profound and still,
true reality unmoved—
this is **non-action**.
Yet it responds to things and moves,
its transformation reaching everywhere,
adapting to all forms—
how could it lack anything?
Through myriad expedients, it does all things.
**Non-action** yet doing—
stillness is not always still,
action is not always active.
When action is not always active,
rest returns to stillness;
when stillness is not always still,
movement arises from stillness.
Stillness is itself movement—
it does not remain in stillness;
movement returns to stillness—
it does not remain in movement.
**Ultimate truth** speaks:
Transformation is not stillness.
All beings can move and can be still—
know that movement and non-movement
are neither movement nor non-movement.
Proclaim this **non-doing** as neither doing nor not-doing.

If kings could uphold it,
all things would naturally align.
**Virtue/power** subdues all things,
the **Dao/Way** is present—thus they are honored.
Kings who uphold the **Dao/Way** do not command alignment,
dukes who cherish **virtue/power** do not enforce transformation.
Yet if transformation falters and action arises,
I shall suppress it with the **uncarved block of the Nameless**.

*"Action"* means to stir—
those who cannot follow transformation
desire to stir the heart toward **action**.
With the **uncarved block of the Nameless**, suppress it—
the heart of **action** will naturally cease.
Preserve the **Dao/Way**, nurture simplicity,
embrace the uncarved, hold to purity.
The **uncarved block of the Nameless**—
it too will not desire.
Its principle is empty yet substantial,
its essence neither true nor false,
neither mundane nor abandoned.
Only the stirring of desire is the ailment—
the Sage uses the **uncarved block of the Nameless** as the remedy.
The remedy removes the ailment;
when the ailment is gone, the remedy is forgotten.
Thus, the **uncarved block of the Nameless**—
it too will not desire.
Or rather, the **uncarved block** with a name—
how could it not desire?
With no desire, all is still—
the world naturally aligns.
Using wisdom to govern is a state’s ruin,
**action** disrupts things, which are ever in motion.
If the ruler can hold to stillness and **non-desire**,
the people need no ordering and will align themselves,
all nations require no commands and will correct themselves.
If inner clarity abandons these burdens,
returning to the Nameless—
if desire still arises,
then peace is lost, and the **Dao/Way** is forsaken.
Now, neither the burdens to abandon nor the Nameless to grasp are seen—
when taking and discarding are forgotten,
desire does not arise.

---

When desire does not arise, stillness comes naturally.
Without **heart-desire**, one aligns with the **Dao/Way**—
thus, the **Dao/Way** and stillness naturally harmonize,
and it is said that the world naturally aligns.

The Dunhuang text appends *Dao De Jing* Chapter 37 from the upper volume to the end of Chapter 81 in the lower volume, reflecting differing interpretations of the *Laozi* text among Tang scholars.
Some hold that the eighty-one chapters symbolize the number nine of the Yang, representing the *Dao* as heaven and the *De* as earth.
Heaven has four seasons, hence the *Dao* volume contains thirty-six chapters.
Earth has five phases, hence the *De* volume contains forty-five chapters.
Thus, Chapter 37 was relocated to follow the *De* volume, to correspond with the numbers of heaven and earth.
