### *The Supreme Lord’s Annotated Scripture of the Wondrous Divine Incantations of the Primordial Transmission of the Great Sage Perfected Warrior of the Mysterious Heaven, Scroll One*
**Compiled and Annotated by Chen You, Disciple of the Inner Teachings of Ascending the Mysteries, Fang Tianzipei of Li**

**"Supreme Lord" (Taishang):** *Tai* (Supreme) denotes reverence; *shang* (Lord) denotes exaltation. This refers to the Primordial Ancestor who established the Dao in the most ancient times—the **Supreme Lord of the Jade Clarity Sacred Realm, the Peerless Dharma King of the Primordial Beginning**; the **True Lord of the Upper Clarity Realm, the Healer-King of the Three Realms, the Numinous Treasure Emperor**; and the **Supreme Lord of the Grand Clarity Immortal Realm, the Guide of the Ten Directions, the Primordial Unity Emperor**. He is the ancestral *qi* of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity, emanating from the Three Clarities.

*The Huainanzi* states: *"The Dao of the Supreme Lord gives birth to the myriad things yet does not possess them; it completes the ten thousand forms yet does not govern them."* It further says: *"The Supreme Lord nurtures transformation; the next best establishes the Dharma."*

Thus, the rulers of successive dynasties have revered the Three Clarities, all honoring them with the title *Taishang*.

**"Expounds" (Shuo):** Means "to elucidate." The Supreme Lord’s teachings of the various scriptures and methods all serve as gradual steps toward the wondrous gate.

*Laozi* says: *"The Supreme Lord establishes virtue; the next best establishes merit."* This scripture was issued by the **Purple Tenuity Emperor of the Northern Culmen Palace**, in accordance with the Supreme Lord’s decree to establish merit—thus, it was expounded on this basis.

In the first kalpa of the **Dragon Han Eon**, corresponding to the first year of the **Eternal Longevity Era of the Great Luo Three Heavens**, on the **Upper Prime Day**, the **Primordial Beginning Emperor** ascended the **Eight Radiant Heavens of the Grand Empyrean** and expounded the **Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Dao for Salvation**, intending to guide the **Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors and all True Lords**. Suddenly, the gates of Heaven shook open, revealing the lower realms below, where the **Third Kalpa of the Kaihuang Era** was drawing to a close, and malevolent *qi* surged violently.

According to *The Authentic Record of Master Dong*, the last ruler of the Xia, **King Zhou**, had lost the Dao through licentiousness, defying Heaven. This provoked the **Six Heavenly Demon Kings**, who harmed the people of the Nine Lands. The Primordial Beginning Emperor then commanded the **Supreme August Jade Emperor of the Golden Watchtower, the Heavenly Sovereign Who Opens the Heavens, Holds the Talisman, and Governs the Calendar in Unity with the True Dao**, to descend to the **Northern Culmen Province** and enforce the decree. In the yang realm, he aided **King Wu of Zhou** in overthrowing Zhou and pacifying the realm; in the yin realm, he dispatched the **Great Mysterious General** to subdue demons and separate humans from spirits. Within seven days, both endeavors succeeded, and the cosmos was purified.

**"Mysterious Heaven" (Xuantian):** *Xuan* (Mysterious) signifies the One; *tian* (Heaven) signifies the Empyrean. This refers to the **Purple Empyrean of the Great Mysterious Heaven in the Northern Quadrant**, transformed by the *qi* of the **Celestial One**. The **Mysterious Emperor** now presides over it, for in the fifty-seventh year of the **Yellow Emperor’s** reign in the lower realms, he ascended by celestial decree, and his palace was established in this realm. As the origin of the **Water Transformation**, it is the foremost of the **Nine Empyreans**.

The **Void of the One** transforms into the **Western-Southern Empyrean of the Primordial Simplicity**, called the **Second Radiance**.
The *qi* of **Pure Unity** transforms into the **Eastern Azure Empyrean of the Azure Primordial Heaven**, called the **Third Radiance**.
The *qi* of **Numinous Unity** transforms into the **Southeastern Verdant Empyrean of the Primordial Division**, called the **Fourth Radiance**.
The **Realm of the Void and Brahman** transforms into the **Fifth Radiance**, the **Jade Emperor’s Palace of the Supreme August Heaven of the Numinous Empyrean**.
The *qi* of **Ultimate Unity** transforms into the **Northwestern Jade Empyrean of the Primordial Mystery**, called the **Sixth Radiance**.
The *qi* of **Mysterious Unity** transforms into the **Western Jade Empyrean of the Grand Simplicity**, called the **Seventh Radiance**.
The **Supreme Void of the Great One** transforms into the **Northeastern Grand Empyrean of the Primordial Azure**, called the **Eighth Radiance**.
Below, it covers the **Southern Flaming Realm of the Mortal World**, where the **Primordial Beginning Emperor** descended to save the multitudes.
The *qi* of the **Primordial Brahman** transforms into the **Southern Crimson Empyrean of the Grand Cinnabar Heaven**, called the **Ninth Radiance**.

Thus, within the **Nine Empyreans**, the years of the **Five Kalpas** are recorded to mark the celestial epochs. The **Three Heavens of the Great Luo** maintain the reign titles.

At the age of fifteen, the **Mysterious Emperor** encountered the **Purple Primordial Lady**, who said: *"Your harmony with the Great Peace ensures your ascension."* His master later told him that after his ascension, he would serve as an **assistant minister in the Three Realms above** and a **Great Sage of the Ten Directions below**. After **2,500 years**, he indeed ascended in the **Gengyin Year of the Yellow Emperor**.

According to *The Outline of Imperial Lineages and Chronologies*, this corresponds to the **twenty-third year of King Zhou’s reign in the Jisi Year**, precisely **2,500 years** later. *The Comprehensive Mirror* records this as the year **King Wen received the Mandate**. In the **first year of King Wu’s reign (Jimao Year)**, it had been **ten years** since the **Purple Primordial Lady’s prophecy**.

The **Heavenly Conjunction of Kan and Li**—the **Mysterious Warrior of the Two Essences**—overthrew the **tyrannical Shang Zhou**, ushering in the **Zhou Wu era**.

**"Perfected Warrior" (Zhenwu):** *Zhen* (Perfected) means "upright"; *wu* (Warrior) means "divine." Originally titled **Mysterious Warrior**, this was changed to **Perfected Warrior** to avoid the taboo of the **Song Dynasty’s temple name**, reflecting his **stern discipline of non-killing in punitive expeditions**. The **Jade Emperor** sent him to guard the **North**, and during the **demon-subduing era of King Zhou’s fall**, he was commanded to **unbind his hair and go barefoot**, granted the **Black Banner of the Sacred Mound**, and **donned armor in person**. After his triumph, he **trampled the Tortoise and Serpent and returned to Heaven**, where he was hailed as **Marshal** and revered as the **Fortune God**.

On that day, the **Mysterious Emperor** looked up and sighed: *"Today, my master’s words have come true!"*

*The Authentic Record of Master Dong* states: In the **second year of the Jiayou Era (Dingyou Year) of the Song Emperor Renzong’s reign**, corresponding to the **third year of the True Transformation Era of the Great Luo Heaven**, on the **fifth day of the fifth month**, the **Three Clarity Lords** ascended the **Jade Palace Hall**. The **Marshal of the Nine Heavens** was ordered to open the celestial records, review the merits and transgressions of the **Ten Thousand Heavens**, and rectify the **Three Officials and Four Saints**. Since the **opening of the Great Void and the birth of the Divine One**, they had **protected Heaven, aided Earth, and nurtured all life**.

On the **first day of the first month of the fourth year**, the **Jade Flower Abbey** completed the engraving of the **Jade Register**. A decree was proclaimed to the **Three Officials and Four Saints**, summoning them to the **Seven-Treasure Jeweled Terrace** on the **Upper Prime Festival**.

During the era of the August Emperor’s perfection, the Supreme Jade Sovereign personally conducted the rites and decreed the investiture of the Dark Warrior, bestowing the title **Supreme Purple August Heavenly-Unity Perfected**, **Jade Void Preceptor and Minister of the Mysteries**, and **Supreme Emperor of the Dark Heaven**, while appointing him to the office of **Nine Heavens Investigator** and granting the subsidiary honorific to the **Tortoise and Serpent**.

This is the *Root Transmission*. "Root" signifies origin, and "transmission" signifies flow—it is the historical compilation edited by the **Golden Watchtower Daily Record Institute**. Moreover, each dynasty’s sovereign has observed its own rites, and by imperial decree of Emperor Huizong, this text was composed to extol the awe-inspiring responses of the Dark Emperor’s might. The **Heavenly Bureau of Celestial Investigation** meticulously recorded each event and memorialized them to the **Mystic Capital**, where they were inscribed into the **Golden Registers and Jade Chronicles**. Whenever the celestial mandate required merit assessment, the **Marshal of the Golden Watchtower**, **Divine Lord Han the Venerable**, along with **Perfected Han of the Life-Commanding Office**, **True Lord of Name-Fixing**, **Nine Heavens Investigator of Merit**, and **Nine Heavens Treasurer of Blessings**, all attested to the facts and jointly compiled this work, henceforth known as the *Root Transmission*.

Recently, another text, *The Veritable Record of the Dark Emperor*, descended from Heaven and was brought to the mortal realm. Through **Zhang Mingdao**, the chief of the **Purple Void Altar** in Xiangyang, it was shown to **Jiang Renyu** of the **Jade Hut** and printed for the world. How profound and unfathomable are the sagely and divine affairs of the Dark Emperor! The compilation was undertaken by **Dong Suhuang**, **Left Minister of the Supreme Perfected Western King**, **Director of the Celestial Mechanism of the Upper Clarity**, **Perfected Lord of Divine Response and Primordial Grace**, **Flying Rosy Radiance Perfected**, and **Middle Yellow Master**. **Zhang Ya**, **Jade Hall Academician of the Nine Heavens Registry**, **Water Bureau Transport Commissioner of the Lower Prime**, and **Inspector of Penal Affairs of the Nine Lands**, **Upper Immortal Yuan Sovereign**, served as its editor.

The postscript records: In the **thirteenth year of the Era of Transformation of the Supreme Great Luo Heaven of the Seventh Kalpa of Extended Peace**, corresponding to the **eleventh year of the Chunxi reign of Emperor Xiaozong of the Great Song**, during the **Middle Upper Prime of the Jiazi cycle**, on the **fifteenth day of the first month**, in the year **Jiachen**.

The **Two Perfected** appended their decree, saying: "Let all who read this purify their hearts and recite it kneeling."

**Divine Incantations**: "Divine" signifies illumination, and "incantation" signifies oath. The Supreme Sovereign established these as covenants of great trust and accord. According to the *Scripture of Subduing Demons*, they are "flying and concealed words"—the sighs of the **Dao’s bellows and keys**. When the divine hear them, they strike the true and summon the numinous, and none fail to arrive. Thus, one should align with the **Heavenly Stem and spread the Dipper**, or **stimulate the Earthly Branch and point the Big Dipper’s handle**, assisting the **Celestial Pass**. At the altar’s center, one knocks the teeth, offers incense, and pledges vows as the heart desires. Sincere recitation moves the **Great Sage Dark Emperor**, whose spiritual resonance spans the warp and weft of existence. Swift without haste, present without motion, all good responses yield great auspiciousness, fulfilling this ordained command.

**Wondrous Scripture**: "Wondrous" signifies attainment, and "scripture" signifies path. The *Essential Affairs of the Dark Emperor* states: "Heaven attains strength, Earth attains tranquility, and the people attain sustenance." Thus, the **Three Powers and the myriad beings** all rely on the **primordial qi of the One Dao** to revolve the **Great Potter’s Wheel**.

At that time, the **wondrous practice** arose from the sincerity of the multitude. The **Great Emperor radiated brilliance upon the Dao**, discoursing on the **method of nurturing the One**, unlocking the **mechanism of Grand Peace**, and pointing to the **timeliness of daily use**—all extensions of the Dark Emperor’s traversed path. Therefore, the **Dao in Heaven coalesces into primordial qi**, while on Earth it **latently governs primordial form**, and within humanity it **stirs primordial consciousness**. To **attain primordial consciousness** is to comprehend the profound mysteries of this scripture and practice them.

The present scripture states: The Dark Emperor descended and declared that in matters of **blessing and benefit**, he **protects people, augments longevity, and fulfills Heaven’s mandate**. Those whose **qi is upright and heart is pure**, whose **loyalty is complete and filial piety is exhaustive**, shall have their names inscribed on **jade tablets** and be **recommended for ascension to immortality**. It is fitting to **pour water, offer abundant incense, and bare one’s sincere emotions**.

The scripture says: "Bow in reverence and pray—no wish shall go unanswered."

At that time, **Immortal Zhang the Heavenly Master**, thrice encountered the descent and transformation of the **Supreme**. According to the *Scripture of the Southern Dipper*, he was bestowed a thousand scrolls of scriptures, all essentials of cultivation, to be transmitted to those of the Dao. These enabled **embodied deliverance**, ensuring **eternal existence through endless kalpas**. This scripture, too, was among those thousand scrolls.

Alas! This book carries the Dao, revealing the **Dark Heaven’s vast gate of expedient means**. The Dao lies in human practice, ascending to the **realm of the Supreme**, guiding one along the **path to immortality**. *Laozi* said: "A tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a tiny sprout; a nine-tiered terrace rises from mounds of earth; a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." And again: "Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning, and there will be no failure." *Mencius* said: "The Dao is like a great road—how could it be hard to know? The trouble lies in people not seeking it."

**At that time**—that is, "thus have I heard."

The compilation of such true records was overseen by the **Divine Scribe of the Celestial Archives Bureau**, an immortal official of the **Supreme Heavenly Editorial Court**, who edited and inscribed these treasured golden tablets. Thus, the phrase *"at that time"* serves to initiate the refined preface, concealing the subtle mechanism of composition within its opening words.

The **Purple Tenuity Great Emperor**, serving under the **Golden Gate of the Celestial Palace** as the **Purple Tenuity Decree Officer**, wields governance over the great affairs of the **Three Bureaus of Heaven, Earth, and Water**, presiding over the authority of life and death, destiny and command. His rank is titled: **Supreme Prime First Grade, Ninefold Qi-Bestowing Fortune-Granting Celestial Official of the Northern Culmen—Purple Tenuity Great Emperor**.

In the **Zhongyuan Festival of the Dragon Han Era’s first year**, when **Heaven inaugurated transformation and established the Five Kalpas to perpetuate destiny**, they were named: **Dragon Han, Crimson Brilliance, Supreme August, Extended Prosperity, and Inaugural August**. Once the Five Kalpas had run their course, the cycle recommenced. At that juncture, it was precisely the **first year of the fourth kalpa of Dragon Han**, coinciding with the **first year of Eternal Longevity in the Supreme Great Luo Heaven**, and corresponding below to the **jǐ-mǎo year of King Wu of Zhou’s reign—on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the rén-shēn day**—a day of celestial assembly and textual review in the heavenly courts.

Within the **Supreme Clarity Realm, at the Northern Culmen Palace**, the **Central Heaven Northern Culmen Palace**, whose lintel bears the title: **Purple Tenuity Decree Office**.

Beneath the Golden Portal of the Supreme Clarity Realm, it governs the Office for Commanding the Myriad Spirits. Before the Hall of Purple Tenuity—this hall’s name being the Northern Culmen Chamber of the Golden Portal—its left and right bureaus exercise universal oversight. It is the courtyard where the Three Luminaries enact their transformations, the precinct where the opening and closing of yin and yang are regulated.

The *Treatise on Celestial Patterns* states: The Purple Tenuity Enclosure comprises fifteen stars—seven in the western array, eight in the eastern—situated north of the Northern Dipper. It is also called the seat of the Purple Tenuity Great Emperor. All the celestial officials and stellar lodges shine resplendently, so that those below on earth may behold them. Arrayed among the sagely beings of the heavens, the officials within and beyond the Purple Tenuity Enclosure—each with its designated overseer—number one hundred eighteen in rank, aggregating seven hundred eighty-two stars. All administer the governance of the celestial mechanism. As the most essential offices of the Three Realms, they comprise the Southern and Northern Dippers, the Eastern and Western Bureaus, the Five Stars of the Five Directions, the Six Palaces and Six Luminaries, the Twenty-Eight Lodges, and the Twelve Celestial Palaces—these six divisions akin to the six ministries and their attendant secretaries. The Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, wielding the authority of Surveillance Censors, supervise the boundless immortal hosts of the inner and outer courts, bearing the mandate to inspect the borders of the Eight Extremities.

All subordinate offices, in accordance with the statutes, on the Three Primordial Days, uniformly adhere to the decrees of the Northern Culmen Purple Tenuity Office, reviewing and recording the registers.

The Southern and Northern Dippers:
The Southern Dipper holds the registers of rank, emolument, and stipend; the Northern Dipper governs the ledgers of life, death, right, and wrong. According to the *Scripture of the Southern Dipper*: The Six Offices of the Southern Dipper and the Seven Governances of the Northern Dipper divide their duties to jointly administer the Three Powers, Six Harmonies, Eight Trigrams, and Nine Palaces, overseeing all officials and ranks within and beyond the realm. They are the central bureaus of the Purple Tenuity and Great Tenuity Enclosures. Above, they govern the twelve celestial divisions and the numinous spirits of heaven; below, they oversee the twelve terrestrial regions and the earthly deities—rulers of the Four Waterways, Five Peaks, Nine Provinces, Eight Extremities, famous mountains and great rivers, city gods and earth altars. In their ledgers and under their jurisdiction lie all peoples, all creatures, and the myriad things, without exception.

The honorific titles of the Six True Lords of the Southern Dipper are:
Heavenly Treasury Controller of Destiny, Upper Minister, True Lord Who Mirrors the State;
Heavenly Minister Recorder of Deeds, Upper Minister, True Lord Who Mirrors the Peaks;
Heavenly Beam Prolonger of Life, Protector of Destiny;
Heavenly Sameness Increaser of Years, Protector of Life;
Heavenly Pivot Deliverer from Calamity, Literary Glory, Refiner of Souls;
Heavenly Mechanism Supervisor of Life, Keeper of the Registers, Great Regulator.

The honorific titles of the Seven Stellar Lords of the Northern Dipper are:
Celestial Rotator, Greedy Wolf, Supreme Star Lord;
Earthly Mechanism, Great Gate, Primordial Star Lord;
Mechanism of Humanity, Emolument Keeper, True Star Lord;
Authority of Time, Literary Curve, Binding Star Lord;
Jade Balance, Health and Chastity, Principal Star Lord;
Opening Yang, Martial Curve, Recorder Star Lord;
Jade Radiance, Breaker of Armies, Pass Star Lord.

Each month, on the three seventh-day periods, the stellar lads of the Two Dippers descend to the human realm to review and admonish matters of life, death, transgression, and fortune.

The Eastern and Western Bureaus:
The Eastern Dipper records destinies, presiding over the Jade Numinous Jade Registers, evaluating the merits of human virtue and conduct, and governing the cultivation of good character. The Western Dipper records names, reviewing the multitudes of beings, executing the decrees of the Registers of Extinction and the Great Calculations of the Passes.

The *Scripture of the Eastern Dipper* states: By the mandate of the Eastern Dipper Emperor Lord, destinies are calculated and years prolonged; descending to the lower world, it delivers from the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties, and can erase death to grant rebirth.

The *Scripture of the Western Dipper* states: The Supreme Clarity Great Perfected Emperor of the Primordial Mystery wields the handle of heaven, issuing commands of the Prisons of Might, subduing demons and restraining spirits, presiding over the execution of punishments within and beyond. It searches out and examines hidden and perverse forms; below, it records the deeds of humanity—good is invariably inscribed, evil invariably noted. Names and titles diverge, the limits of life and death ever revolve in cycles of eight hundred myriad millions, the roots of good and evil entwined like ropes, manifest and unhidden.

The honorific titles of the Five Stars of the Eastern Dipper are:
Azure Numinosity, True Lord Prolonger of Life;
Numinous Radiance, True Lord Protector of Destiny;
Opener of Heaven, Great Guardian, Assembler of Blessings;
Great Brilliance, Harmonizer of Yang, True Lord Preserver of Harmony;
Tail Extremity, Supreme Overseer.

The honorific titles of the Four Stars of the Western Dipper are:
White Standard Emperor Lord;
Lofty Primordial True Lord;
Curved Sovereign, Numinous True Lord;
General of Mighty Might.

The true offices of the Two Bureaus descend to the human realm, establishing their ordinances on the first, fifth, and ninth days of the month for the Eastern Dipper, and the seventh, ninth, and fifteenth days for the Western Dipper.

The Five Stars of the Five Directions:
They govern the five directions—gēng-xīn, jiǎ-yǐ, rén-guǐ, bǐng-dīng, wù-jǐ—corresponding to the Five Phases: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, the stars of the Five Constants’ forms and qi.

The *Scripture of the Seven-Star Divine Incantation* states: Heaven and earth establish their positions, thereby instituting the Five Phases. They traverse the world, inspecting nations without the Way, observing inauspicious people. All within the bounds of their domains—creeping, crawling, and breathing beings—have their destinies tied to heaven.

The *Essential Compilation of the Primordial Scripture* states:
The Year Star of the East governs benevolence, engenders jiǎ-yǐ, transforms grasses and trees, administers the spring mandate, and oversees the myriad crawling and flying creatures born of transformation—twelve years to complete one celestial circuit.
The Great White Star of the West governs righteousness, engenders gēng-xīn, transforms metals and stones, administers the autumn mandate, and oversees the myriad horned and hornless creatures born of the womb—one year to complete one celestial circuit.
The Sparkling Deluder of the South governs propriety, engenders bǐng-dīng, transforms smoke and fire, administers the summer mandate, and oversees the myriad feathered and winged creatures born of the egg—two years to complete one celestial circuit.
The Chronographic Star of the North governs wisdom, engenders rén-guǐ, transforms water and springs, administers the winter mandate, and oversees the myriad shelled and scaleless creatures born of moisture—one year to complete one celestial circuit.
The Quelling Star of the Center governs trust, engenders wù-jǐ, transforms dust and earth, administers the four seasons, and oversees the myriad wise, foolish, and deluded humans endowed with spirit—twenty-nine years to complete one celestial circuit.

If a ruler can be reverent and temperate, sagely, respectful, pure, frugal, and yielding, then the August Ultimate is established.

Then naturally the Five Stars descend with auspicious omens, and their blessings extend throughout the realm.

*The Essential Hong Fan of All Under Heaven* states:
In demeanor, be reverent and solemn.
When Jupiter responds, it accords with wood’s bending and straightening, sending timely rains; words are heeded and compliant.
When Venus responds, it accords with metal’s malleability and transformation, sending timely sunshine; sight is clear and wise.
When Mars responds, it accords with fire’s blazing ascent, sending timely warmth; hearing is keen and plans astute.
When Mercury responds, it accords with water’s moistening descent, sending timely cold; thought is sagely and profound.
When Saturn responds, it accords with earth’s sowing and reaping, sending timely winds; thus is humanity.
When the ruler’s virtue aligns, the Five Fortunes are evenly distributed, extending to the myriad people.

Should the opposite occur, the stars will trespass and encroach, comets and baleful stars will clash and shatter, giving rise to warfare, floods, droughts, and displacement—calamities that bring ruin and death to the multitudes.

*The Book of Destiny* states:
The Five Stars traverse the celestial stations, exhibiting phases of direct motion, stationing, retrogradation, and concealment. When they illuminate men and women, determining the Four Pillars at birth, direct motion brings fortune while retrogradation brings misfortune.

As for the Six Palaces and the Six Luminaries—
they govern the Six Palaces of the Great Yang, Great Yin, Celestial One, Great One, Yellow Banner, and Leopard Tail, presiding over the six revolutions of day, night, darkness, brightness, wind, and rain. These are the Sun, Moon, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, and Saturn.
The Six Luminaries proceed rightward through the celestial stations, conforming to the Purple Tenuity’s system of regulation, their movements varying in speed.

*The Scripture of Disaster Dispelling* states:
The sentient beings of the Desire Realm pursue only fleeting glory, neglecting the true Dao. They remain unaware that the Five Phases’ revolutions and the Eleven Luminaries’ illumination govern their fortune and misfortune.
When fire and earth station or conceal, when metal and wood trespass and encroach, when Rāhu and Ketu surge in opposition, when the Sun and Moon suffer eclipses—these bring about the relocation of prefectures and counties, the people’s disasters, floods, fires, locusts, and warfare, all arising therefrom.

*The Astronomical Treatise* states:
When a state lacks governance or misuses its power, it incurs the reprimand of the Sun and Moon. The six extremes manifest in the heavens as warnings to admonish and caution the ruler.
The Sun, sovereign of all yang, corresponds to the ruler and governs procreation, completing one celestial circuit each year. Should an eclipse occur, it warns the ruler: governance is flawed, the sovereign’s authority falters, the spirit’s resolve is benumbed and deluded, the altars of soil and grain grow feeble—thus the Sun’s eclipse punishes with enduring yin.
The Moon, sovereign of all yin, corresponds to the empress and great ministers, governing punishments. An eclipse admonishes treacherous ministers and disobedient children. Completing one celestial circuit each month, if words are not heeded and courage swells with recklessness, if the people’s extremity is sorrow, then the Moon’s eclipse punishes with enduring yang.

Jupiter, continuing Thursday, corresponds to the Five Fortunes and governs learning. Completing one celestial circuit every twenty-eight years, if one’s demeanor is irreverent, intent wild and reckless, and farming seasons are usurped, extremity turns to evil—wood’s icy desolation punishes with enduring rain.
Lunar Comet, continuing Mercury, corresponds to ancestral temples and governs sacrifices. Completing one circuit every nine years, if anger manifests as a comet with bristling head and trailing tail, if hearing is not keen and emotions are unrestrained and hasty, if heaven’s seasons are defied, extremity turns to poverty—water’s calamity punishes with enduring cold.
Rāhu, continuing Mars, corresponds to auxiliary duties and governs yang virtue. Completing one circuit every eighteen years, if it eclipses the Sun and Moon, if sight is unclear and the heart defies restraint, if laws are spurned, extremity turns to loathing—fiery disease punishes with bloodshed and enduring brilliance.
Ketu, continuing Saturn, corresponds to sowing and reaping and governs yin virtue. Completing one circuit every eighteen years, if anger causes mountains and rivers to collapse, if thought is intolerant and plans reckless, if parents are insulted, extremity turns to famine—punishing with enduring winds.

In an era of Great Peace, the Sun does not eclipse nor do the stars rebel, for virtue has reached its zenith.

For the men and women of the world, all take the Great Yang as the origin of their life palace, while the Great Yin determines their body palace. The Celestial One governs the Five Fortunes of humanity, the Great One oversees untimely deaths, Rāhu punishes men, and Ketu admonishes women. Within the Six Luminaries, the Sun and Moon distinctly divide day and night. Rāhu, Ketu, Comet, and Purple Tenuity—these dark luminaries transform people toward goodness, manifesting their light only when punishing the wicked.

The Twenty-Eight Constellations, resplendent in sound,
reside in the four directions, arrayed across the heavens, comprising three hundred sixty-five degrees and more. They are subordinate to the Seven Governors—the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn—whose lodgings are called the Twenty-Eight Constellations. They regulate the years, months, dawns, and dusks, establishing the four directions and the seven luminaries.

Void and Pleiades assist the Sun Emperor’s governance;
Danger and Net assist the Moon Sovereign’s governance;
Wall and Triaster, Winnowing Basket and Chariot Roof assist Mercury’s governance;
House and Beak, Wings and Tail assist Mars’ governance;
Dipper and Straddler, Well and Horn assist Jupiter’s governance;
Ox and Bond, Ghost and Neck assist Venus’ governance;
Maid and Stomach, Willow and Chamber assist Saturn’s governance.

They perpetually cycle through the years, months, days, and hours to accomplish the year’s work. Descending through the sixty cyclical signs, they determine the natal stars of men and women. According to the solar terms, they divide the true influences, governing the twenty-four administrations and the affairs of the nether prisons.

Following *The Astronomical Treatise*, they oversee the Son of Heaven, the heir apparent, empresses, ancestral temples, civil and military officials, and the images of all things under heaven. All are entrusted as follows:

According to the *Essential Principles of the Orthodox Unity*, those who govern mountains are bound beneath the Twenty-Eight Constellations. The Luminous Establishment of the Blessed Court gathers the good and evil deeds of the world’s people: the Left Qi Immortal Official records the good, while the Right Qi Ghost Official records the evil. On each day when the Celestial Officials convene, the two bureaus of each constellation transcribe and present the annual registers.

The Twelve Palaces of the Gods,
Beyond the revolving heavens, there are twelve celestial stations, designated by the positions of *zi, chou, yin, mao, chen, si, wu, wei, shen, you, xu,* and *hai*. The earthly branches govern the corresponding terrestrial creatures: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. Each palace is overseen by a Star Lord, assisted by five Generals of the Five Phases, who command legions of yin and yang scribes—numbering in the billions—to thoroughly examine and cross-reference the twelve terrestrial divisions, wherein all the daily affairs of the world’s people are produced.

The palace generals, each guarding their respective domains, record the good and evil deeds of the world’s people within the three ten-day periods of the corresponding monthly establishment. They await the triennial assembly of the Three Primordials to submit their registers to the Purple Tenuity Commandery. The names of the sixty subordinate generals are detailed under the subsequent *jiazi* verses.

The Flying Celestial Divine Kings,
The Flying Celestial Divine Kings serve as the Chief Envoys of Merit and Transgression Inspection. They are known as the Eastern Hu Elder Lord, the Western Shi Elder Lord, the Southern Yue Elder Lord, the Northern Qiang Elder Lord, and the Central Cang Elder Lord. Stationed in the five directions, they preside as the ancestors of the myriad spirits, commanding an assembly of flying clerks, jade lads, jade maidens, and wondrously acting perfected ones—numbering twelve million four hundred thousand in total.

They roam and observe the Great Void, and on each of the Five La Days, they examine and assess the worldly, bestowing or withdrawing fortune and misfortune.

On the Heavenly La Day, the first day of the first month, the Eastern Hu Elder Lord gathers the assembly of elders at the Nine Qi Azure Dragon Gate to collectively deliberate and determine the duration of people’s spiritual qi, the timing of their prayers for descendants, and other matters, which are then reported to the Mysterious Ancestor.

On the Earthly La Day, the fifth day of the fifth month, the Southern Yue Elder Lord convenes the elders at the Three Qi Cinnabar Terrace Gate to assess the official ranks, blessings, and physiognomy of the worldly, as well as the prosperity or decline of their blood relations.

On the Moral La Day, the seventh day of the seventh month, the Western Shi Elder Lord gathers the elders at the Seven Qi Pale Spirit Gate to evaluate the robustness or frailty of people’s physiques, the success or failure of their studies and careers, and their reputations.

On the People’s Yearly La Day, the first day of the tenth month, the Northern Qiang Elder Lord assembles the elders at the Five Qi Pale Spirit Gate to determine changes in people’s stipends, fluctuations in their diets, the rise and fall of their official ranks, the length of their lifespans, and the severity of their illnesses.

On the Royal La Day, the La Day of the twelfth month—specifically the third *mo* day after the winter solstice— the Central Cang Elder Lord gathers the elders at the One Qi Wuji Gate to assess calamities, strange dreams, fortunes and misfortunes, the waxing and waning of "post-horses" in time, and the locations of life and death.

The Five Elders record the proceedings of the five assemblies and await the triennial Three Primordials festival to personally present them at the silent audience in the Purple Tenuity Imperial Court.

The Boundless Immortal Hosts,
The radiance of the sun, moon, and stars shines upon the mortal realm, traversing a distance of 356,971 *li* to reach the Eight Vast Territories. Beyond the Eight Knots, far removed from the Northern Culmen, lies the Boundless Realm. The ranks of the Boundless Immortal Offices vary.

According to the *Sutra of Causes and Conditions*, the Supreme Lord issued a decree commanding the Heavenly Thearchs to summon the Five Divine Kings of the Emperors. They dispatched the Nine Bureaus, Four Offices, Seven Star Lads, Ten Heavenly Generals, Eight Divine Lads, Wondrously Acting Perfected Ones, Celestial Immortals, Flying Immortals, Examiners of Scholars, and Examiners of Soldiers—altogether nine hundred million myriad beings—each assigned to their respective domains. Some manifest as clouds, some as rain, some as wind, some as dew, some as birds, some as beasts, some as great, some as small, some as short, some as tall, some as visible, some as hidden. In myriad transformations, they hold registers and wield brushes, ceaselessly investigating, searching, and scrutinizing day and night. They record merits and transgressions, and on the appointed days of the Three Primordials, return to their offices for review and verification.

They all approach the imperial throne, reverently paying homage to the august majesty. "They all approach" signifies that all attend the audience. At that time, the officials of the Six Departments of the Stellar Offices, along with the Divine Kings of Investigation, the Wondrously Acting Immortal Hosts, and the courtly assembly, present themselves before the imperial steps, each reverently holding their positions with solemn respect for the court’s authority.

The original office itself comprises Three Bureaus and Thirty-Six Offices. Each office has one Examiner and one thousand two hundred Scribes who hold registers and wield records, their dignified demeanor resplendent as they stand in the imperial court.

According to the *Scripture of the Three Primordials’ Precepts and Admonitions*, the Purple Tenuity Palace governs the Three Bureaus:
- The Left Bureau oversees the Register of Life, examined by the Fire Official of the Great Yang.
- The Right Bureau oversees the Register of Death, examined by the Water Official of the Great Yin.
- The Central Bureau oversees the Registers of Life, Death, Sin, and Blessing, examined by the Wind Blade.

The Three Bureaus are under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Lady of the Great Mystery, the Azure Lady of the Upper Primordial. They administer the systems of the various offices, manage the recording of registers, and meticulously submit them to the Upper Primordial Offices of Luminous Perfection, the Upper Primordial Office of Surveillance, and the Upper Primordial Office of Brahman Conduct. The titles of the offices are listed as follows:

Upper Primordial Office of the Numinous Gate,
Upper Primordial Office of Divine Prohibitions,
Upper Primordial Office of Illumination,
Upper Primordial Office of Rectification,
Upper Primordial Office of Enlightenment,
Upper Primordial Office of the Jade Capital,
Upper Primordial Office of the Southern Ascendant,
Upper Primordial Office of Primordial Merit,
Upper Primordial Office of the Three Numinosities,
Upper Primordial Office of Luminous Brahman,
Upper Primordial Office of August Numinosity,
Upper Primordial Office of the Great Clarity,
Upper Primordial Office of Proclamation,
Upper Primordial Office of the Luminous Capital,
Upper Primordial Office of the Grand Constancy,
Upper Primordial Office of the Capital Numinosity,
Upper Primordial Office of the Grand Ceremony,
Upper Primordial Office of Alliance and Law,
Upper Primordial Office of Examination and Rectification,
Upper Primordial Office of Luminous Augustness,
Upper Primordial Office of the Nine Capitals,
Upper Primordial Office of Shamans,
Upper Primordial Office of the Four Luminaries,
Upper Primordial Office of Heavenly Surveillance,
Upper Primordial Office of Destructive Forces,
Upper Primordial Office of Heavenly Alliance,
Upper Primordial Office of the Dark Capital,
Upper Primordial Office of August Demeanor,
Upper Primordial Office of the Great Yin,
Upper Primordial Office of the Lower Primordial,
Upper Primordial Office of Surveillance,
Upper Primordial Office of the Great Luminosity,
Upper Primordial Office of Numinous Surveillance.

Whenever the hosts of perfected beings assemble in the Purple Tenuity Hall, the officials of each office oversee the proceedings. They collectively manage:
- The titles and ranks of all Upper Perfected Ones, their hierarchy and reverence, and the records of their merits and transgressions;
- The processions and rituals of all Upper Perfected Saints as they pay homage and circumambulate, and the records of their merits and transgressions;
- The retinues and banquets of all Upper Perfected Great Saints as they accompany the imperial carriage, and the records of their merits and transgressions;
- The charts and registers of all life and death, and the records of their merits and transgressions;
- The life-and-death registers and the records of their merits and transgressions;
- The merits and virtues of all life and death, and the weight of their merits and transgressions;
- The merits and virtues of all life and death, and the weight of their merits and transgressions;
- The services and retributions of all ghosts and spirits as they fulfill their duties and undergo cyclic transformations, and the records of their merits and transgressions;
- The confinement and deliverance of all ghosts and spirits in the nether realms, and the records of their merits and transgressions regarding the duration of their deliverance;
- The ascension and deliverance of all ghosts and spirits, the rebirth of deceased souls, and the weight of their merits and transgressions;
- The refinement and rebirth of all deceased souls, and the records of their merits and transgressions;
- The attainment of the Dao and the purity of rank among all divine immortals, and the records of their merits and transgressions;
- The ranks and merits of the myriad demons in their praises and songs.

Moreover, across the Three Realms, the Nine Provinces, the Ten Directions, and the myriad states, all beings—whether divine immortals, ghosts, or humans—who attain the Dao and its ranks are subject to these admonitions and assessments.

At times, Jade Lads,
akin to the office of the Palace Attendant in the mortal realm, are summoned by the court as Jade Lads.

The Great Emperor transmits his edict: to the Northern Great General, the Dark Martial General, who shall receive the sagely command of the Jade Emperor. "Shall receive" signifies "is deemed worthy of." The Supreme Mystery may bow to the Dark Martial. From the Purple Tenuity Bureau of the Northern Culmen, bearing the Mandate of the August Heaven, each edict is issued with the Treasured Proclamation as its standard, rewarding meritorious deeds in due time.

By the Great Emperor’s decree, the Northern Supreme Mystery Marshal of the Primordial is to personally attend this court and bow to receive the edict from beneath the Three Heavenly Gates. At this assembly, all controllers of the True Unity shall witness the bestowal of the spoken treasure and hear the Jade Lads proclaim the imperial mandate.

The edict is prepared by the Great Elixir Perfected, Academician of the Mysterious at the Jade Flower Institute of the Golden Watchtower, in accordance with the imperial will, its words composed and verified, bearing the Jade Emperor’s seal of investiture—the Jade Seal, as recorded in *The Record of Directions*. The *Treasured Proclamation* states:

"Only you, who embody the auspiciousness of the Primal Yellow qi, guide the fullness of the Ninefold Yang’s majesty, whose virtue exalts your immortal rank and whose might pierces the divine perfected—issuing decrees for two thousand five hundred springs and autumns, your merits equaling forty-two kalpas—have, in the reckoning of years and the transformation of all beings, not erred by even a hair’s breadth.

Now, as the great kalpa of destiny unfolds and the boundaries between orthodoxy and heterodoxy blur, the Six Heavenly Demon Kings arise, harming the people of the Nine Lands. Without true power, how could peace and tranquility be restored? The Three Clarities rely upon you; the Nine Sages depend on you. Once more, you uphold the flourishing of the Dao and its laws, and again, you rectify the perverse and demonic.

You command the dual essences of Water and Fire within your grasp and govern the Generals of Jia and Geng within your discipline. Through this, your divine transformations nourish the myriad beings, and your merits shine resplendent—yet the multitude of sages cannot fully extol your glory.

It is fitting that you return to your origin and revert to your root, restoring your proper position. If not for this exalted title, how could your virtue be made manifest? The imperial seal is bestowed; do not decline in modesty. You are hereby specially appointed as the Great General Dark Martial Who Guards Heaven, Commander-in-Chief of the Three Primordials, Envoy of the Nine Heavens’ Patrols, Left Celestial Pivot of the Northern Culmen, Grand Marshal of the Three Realms overseeing the affairs of divine immortals, ghosts, and spirits, and Judge of the Right Victorious Bureau of the Mysterious Capital. You shall continue as the Supreme Mystery Marshal of the Primordial Harmony and the Reckoner of Promotions, and upon receipt of this decree, you shall act accordingly."

Recorded by the descent of the brush of Perfected Lord Dong. It is decreed that this be proclaimed thrice monthly.

The Right Vigilant Decree of the August Culmen establishes the fixed system for the sixth, sixteenth, and twenty-sixth days of each month. You shall command the divine troops and personally traverse the various heavens to conduct thorough inspections. Wherever you encounter perverse qi or inauspicious stars deviating from their proper courses, swiftly execute and eradicate them.

The palaces of the stellar lodges of the various heavens all reside above the ninefold Brahmanic qi, known as the celestial ortho-qi, which overshadows and sustains the Three Realms, aiding in the completion of Heaven and Earth. *The Star Charts of Gan and Shi* states: "In general, there are two hundred eighty-three celestial offices, comprising a total of one thousand four hundred sixty-four stars, serving as the fixed record." These govern the offices, palaces, goods, and implements of the world below, as well as the people’s livelihoods. Thus, forms arise on earth, while their essences correspond to heaven. *The Book of Changes: Appended Remarks* says: "Heaven and Earth take their positions, and the mountains and marshes communicate their qi." Qi is the fundamental spirit of Heaven and Earth. *Zhuangzi* states: "Heaven possesses six qi—yin, yang, darkness, brightness, wind, and rain—which circulate in accordance with the seasons. These are called the primordial qi, which generate and nurture the myriad things, completing the works of Heaven and Earth."

When a state’s virtue is defiled, calamities and misfortunes are inescapable, manifesting as inauspicious stars and perverse qi. *Records of the Grand Historian* notes: "The cloud of Wei resembled a dog; that of Zhao, an ox; that of Chu, the sun; that of Zhou, a chariot wheel; that of Yue, a horned dragon; that of Qin, a traveler; that of Lu, a horse; that of Song, a carriage; that of Han, a cloth; that of Zheng, a crimson robe; that of Wei, a rat; that of Shu, a state chariot; that of Han, a shattered mountain. When such clouds descend upon an army, they are called ‘camp-head stars.’" *The Yellowstone Duke’s Celestial Writ* says: "Though resembling stars, they are not stars. With sixty-four transformations, they are collectively called ‘inauspicious comets.’ The first is called ‘State Yellow,’ resembling the Old Man Star, its red rays scattered—it portends invaders and insurmountable military disasters. The second, ‘Illuminating Brightness,’ lacks rays or horns, being blue above and white below—where it appears, frequent campaigns arise. The third, ‘Ugly Remnant,’ resembles the Morning Star, its light nearly extinguished—its appearance in the due east is inauspicious. The fourth, ‘Bandit Star,’ has several red rays, its light flickering—its appearance in the due south is ominous. The fifth, ‘Mother Peril,’ resembles Venus but lacks rays or horns—its appearance in the due west is inauspicious. The sixth, ‘Prison River,’ emits three comets, blue within and red without—its appearance in the due north is baleful. (The remainder is omitted for brevity.)"

According to *The Jin Annals of the Five Phases*: "The emperors and kings, their virtue matching Heaven and Earth, harmonize with yin and yang. Their proclamations and decrees move both the hidden and the manifest. The subtlest signs of fortune and misfortune arise in response to stimuli. Generally, the hearts of men align with the will of Heaven. When disasters and chaos accumulate, they become visible: halos embracing the sun, jade pendants adorning the moon, or red crows flying beside the sun, or two suns or two moons appearing and vanishing behind clouds—such evils are extreme. When a ruler’s virtue is defiled, he summons his own replacement, for this too is the will of Heaven. Thus, Heaven first admonishes with calamities and anomalies, warning without arbitrary punishment. If the ruler fails to reform and reflect, perverse qi descends again, and inauspicious stars and monstrous omens appear to warn and alarm. Upon witnessing these, one may infer the will of the August Culmen. Embracing the Supreme’s command to cherish life, you are further charged, O Mysterious Emperor, to pacify, suppress, and subdue the inauspicious, harmonizing and rectifying the transformations to subtly assist the lords of the cosmos."

Additionally, during the Three Primordials—the sacred days when the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and the Water Bureau convene—these occur on the *yin*, *shen*, and *hai* days of the *chen* month, as well as the fifteenth day, known as the Three Primordial Festivals. According to *The Scripture of Ranks and Instruments*: "The Upper Primordial’s Purple Tenuity Palace comprises three bureaus: the Left Great Yang, the Right Great Yin, and the Central Wind Blade. The Middle Primordial’s Clear Void Palace comprises three bureaus: the Left Cavern Yang, the Right Northern Capital, and the Central Clear Void. The Lower Primordial’s Azure Florescence Palace comprises three bureaus: the Left Clear Source, the Right Cold Night, and the Central Clear Numinous. Beneath these nine bureaus lie one hundred twenty departments, which examine the registers of the ascent and descent of divine immortals and stellar lodges, the records of the rise and fall of lands corresponding to celestial divisions, and the limits of transformations affecting gods and men. They review the lifespans of the rulers, empresses, princes, crown princes, officials, and common people of the great thousand-worlds, along with all records of good and evil deeds. Those who receive great blessings in this life have their cases reviewed every three years. Those who receive moderate blessings are reviewed every nine years. Those who receive minor blessings are reviewed every twenty-four years. Decisions are made regarding the extension or curtailment of lifespans, changes in fortune or misfortune, and the granting or withholding of rewards, with the duration of years and months determined accordingly. Thus, both punishments and blessings are meted out, and merits and transgressions are recompensed alike. They also review the limits of service for ghosts and spirits within the Three Realms, the periods of transformation for fish and dragons, the months and years when the myriad creatures of flight and movement change their forms, the judgments and registrations of karmic retributions in the Nine Dark Realms, and the binding of those who must endure unceasing kalpas—all are meticulously reviewed and settled."

As recorded in *The Sutra of Causes and Conditions*: "On the fifteenth day of the first month, the Upper Primordial’s Palace Lord, the First-Rank Ninefold Qi Bestowing Blessings Heavenly Official, the Purple Tenuity Great Emperor, dispatches ten celestial numinous officials, divine immortal troops, upper sagely perfected ones, and wondrously accomplished perfected persons, along with innumerable hosts, to descend into the human realm and review and determine sins and blessings. On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the Middle Primordial’s Palace Lord, the Second-Rank Sevenfold Qi Pardoning Sins Earthly Official, the Clear Void Great Emperor, dispatches nine terrestrial numinous officials, divine immortal troops, and the troops of famous mountains and grottoes, along with innumerable hosts, to emerge into the human realm and review and admonish sins and blessings. On the fifteenth day of the tenth month, the Lower Primordial’s Palace Lord, the Third-Rank Fivefold Qi Relieving Calamities Water Official, the Supporting Florescence Great Emperor, dispatches the Nine River Water Emperors, the Twelve River Sources, the Han Valley Great Spirits, the Sunlit Valley Divine Kings, and the water bureau’s numinous officials to arrive in the human realm and review and admonish sins and blessings."

The Mysterious Emperor, in accordance with the received mandate, is hereby appointed as the Commander-in-Chief overseeing the affairs of the Three Primordials’ troops. You shall continue to command and supervise the innumerable soldiers while also investigating the conditions of the mortal realm.

The *Jié* are the Eight Seasonal Nodes. On these days, the yin-yang and Eight Trigrams Spirit Lords are newly appointed to exchange and transfer their worldly duties. On these days, the Trigram Spirits, in accordance with the authority of the North Culmen, issue commands and decrees, open and close yin and yang, and give life or death to the myriad beings.

Furthermore, as recorded in the various true scriptures: The heavens obey the edicts of the Primordial Beginning, and on the days of the Eight Nodes, dispatch the exalted perfected ones, the Three Primordial Ladies of the Pure, and the Nine Numinous Ladies to ascend to the Nine Heavens and perform the Dao to confer immortality. Next, the Ten Directions’ Savior-from-Suffering Heavenly Worthies and jade lads and maidens are sent down to deliver the souls languishing in the long night of the Nine Netherworlds. The Trigram Spirits are also dispatched to review and admonish the regulation of the nodes, where thunder stirs, winds scatter, rain and dew moisten, and the sun’s brilliance shines—water nourishes and brings all things to fruition, governing the myriad affairs of the world.

On the day of *Lìchūn* (Beginning of Spring), the Lord of the Beginning Azure Heaven, together with the Merit Clerk General, the *Gèn* Trigram Great Spirit, and the Regulator of the Celestial Handle, descends into the human realm to oversee the gradual transformation of the *tiáofēng* (sprouting wind), causing the myriad beings to bud and branch.

On the day of *Chūnfēn* (Spring Equinox), the Azure Numinous Emperor, together with the Grand Impetus General, the *Zhèn* Trigram Great Spirit, and the Inspector of Pervasive Vision, descends into the human realm to oversee the flourishing transformation of the *míngshùfēng* (bright and abundant wind), causing the myriad beings to germinate and sprout.

On the day of *Lìxià* (Beginning of Summer), the Lord of the Beginning Vermilion Heaven, together with the Grand Unity General, the *Xùn* Trigram Great Spirit, and the Red Impetuous One, descends into the human realm to oversee the constant transformation of the *qīngmíngfēng* (clear and bright wind), causing the myriad beings to flourish and grow.

On the day of *Xiàzhì* (Summer Solstice), the Vermilion Numinous Emperor, together with the Victorious Foremost General, the *Lí* Trigram Great Spirit, and [text missing], descends into the human realm to oversee the culmination of the transformation of the *jǐngfēng* (scorching wind), stirring the myriad beings to appear in full.

On the day of *Lìqiū* (Beginning of Autumn), the Lord of the Beginning White Heaven, together with the Conveying Messenger General, the *Kūn* Trigram Great Spirit, and the Multitudes of Peers, descends into the human realm to oversee the observation of the transformation of the *dòngfēng* (freezing wind), causing the myriad beings to develop flavor.

On the day of *Qiūfēn* (Autumn Equinox), the Radiant Numinous Emperor, together with the Following Chief General, the *Duì* Trigram Great Spirit, and the Examiner of the Celestial Handle, descends into the human realm to oversee the fostering transformation of the *yánhéfēng* (closing and opening wind), causing the myriad beings to mature and be harvested.

On the day of *Lìdōng* (Beginning of Winter), the Lord of the Beginning Mysterious Heaven, together with the Ascending Brightness General, the *Qián* Trigram Great Spirit, and the Strong Yu, descends into the human realm to oversee the transformation of the *bùfēng* (unceasing wind), causing the myriad beings to respond to the season’s end.

On the day of *Dōngzhì* (Winter Solstice), the Five Numinous Emperors, together with the Divine Marshal General, the *Kǎn* Trigram Great Spirit, and the Exhausted Oddity, descend into the human realm to oversee the welling transformation of the *guǎngmòfēng* (vast and desolate wind), causing the myriad beings to coil and hide.

Each year, the Eight Trigram Spirit Lords are dispatched in rotation to govern and administer. Each term of office lasts for three qi, forty-five days, while the remaining time is devoted to overseeing the affairs of the lower officials, the people, and the sowing and cultivation of crops.

The Mysterious Emperor, holding the handle of the Northern Culmen’s Celestial Pivot, directs the Eight Trigrams, harmonizes cold and heat, and refines and forges the essence and purity.

On *Jiǎzǐ* days, these belong to the Grand Unity Central Terrace, where the Grand Envoy oversees the passes. The Six Jia Generals of the Primordial Epochs assemble, and the Nine Heavens’ Marshal is summoned to command the jade lads in reviewing and recording, bestowing or depriving the mortal realm of births—male or female—and predetermining the auspicious or inauspicious circumstances of their birth times. The Grand Unity Central Terrace is the Central Palace of the North Culmen. The Grand Envoy is the Purple Tenuity Great Emperor.

As stated in the *Scripture on Protecting the Womb*: The Primordial Beginning constantly dispatches the Six Jia Direct Attendant Generals, jade lads and maidens, and accompanying officials and talisman clerks, who hold talismans and bear staffs, descending into the human realm to protect the womb, guard life, pacify the hun souls, and stabilize the po souls.

The *Jiǎzǐ* General is Wang Wenqing; the *Bǐngzǐ* General is Xing Sunqing; the *Wùzǐ* General is Yue Shiyang; the *Gēngzǐ* General is Yang Zhongsheng; the *Rénzǐ* General is Su Shangqing; the *Yǐchǒu* General is Long Jiqing; the *Dīngchǒu* General is Zhao Ziyu; the *Jǐchǒu* General is Fan Zhongyang; the *Xīnchǒu* General is Lin Weiqing; the *Guǐchǒu* General is Jiang Hanqing; the *Jiǎyín* General is Ming Wenzhang; the *Bǐngyín* General is Zhang Zhongqing; the *Wùyín* General is Yu Zizhang; the *Gēngyín* General is Chu Jinqing; the *Rényín* General is Qiu Mengqing; the *Yǐmǎo* General is Dai Gongyang; the *Dīngmǎo* General is Sima Qing; the *Jǐmǎo* General is Shi Wenyang; the *Xīnmǎo* General is Guo Ziliang; the *Guǐmǎo* General is Su Tajia; the *Jiǎchén* General is Meng Feiqing; the *Bǐngchén* General is Huo Shuying; the *Wùchén* General is Chu Jiqing; the *Gēngchén* General is Yin Jiaqing; the *Rénchén* General is Wu Zhiqing; the *Yǐsì* General is Tang Wenqing; the *Dīngsì* General is Cui Juqing; the *Jǐsì* General is He Wenchang; the *Xīnsì* General is Yang Zhonggong; the *Guǐsì* General is Shi Gongsong; the *Jiǎwǔ* General is Wei Shangqing; the *Bǐngwǔ* General is Wei Wengong; the *Wùwǔ* General is Cong Yuanguang; the *Gēngwǔ* General is Feng Zhongqing; the *Rénwǔ* General is Ma Ziming; the *Yǐwèi* General is Du Zhongyang; the *Dīngwèi* General is Shi Shutong; the *Jǐwèi* General is Shi Tongqing; the *Xīnwèi* General is Wang Wenzhang; the *Guǐwèi* General is Lü Weiming; the *Jiǎshēn* General is Hu Wenchang; the *Bǐngshēn* General is Zhu Bozhong; the *Wùshēn* General is Fan Boyang; the *Gēngshēn* General is Hua Wenyang; the *Rénshēn* General is Hou Boqing; the *Yǐyǒu* General is Kong Ligong; the *Dīngyǒu* General is Zang Wengong; the *Jǐyǒu* General is Cheng Wenchang; the *Xīnyǒu* General is Na Yuanyu; the *Guǐyǒu* General is Sun Zhongfang; the *Jiǎxū* General is Jiang Zizhan; the *Bǐngxū* General is Che Yuansheng; the *Wùxū* General is Fan Shaoqing; the *Gēngxū* General is Shi Ziren; the *Rénxū* General is Yue Jinqing; the *Yǐhài* General is Pang Mingxin; the *Dīnghài* General is Zhang Wentong; the *Jǐhài* General is Feng Duqing; the *Xīnhài* General is Zuo Zixing; the *Guǐhài* General is Zuo Shisong.

Each of these marshals, when ascending to the Central Terrace to review and transfer on the appointed day, first reports to the Nine Heavens’ Roaming Envoys’ Bureau, then together departs the mortal realm. The Mysterious Emperor commands the harmonious transfer and review at the Bureau of Administration, and the cases are sent down to the human realm to assist in transformation and nurturing.

On *Gēngshēn* days, these belong to the Supreme Mystery Upper Palace, which governs the Three Corpses of the people.

The Dao states: From the moment a fetal form takes shape, it is endowed with spirits governing the hundred bones and their outer and inner aspects, observing all human affairs—yet only the Three Corpses preside over this multitude and report their deeds.

The title *Tai Xuan* designates the capital precinct of the Northern Culmen. *Upper Palace* refers to the name of the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Primordial Palace. According to the *Scripture of Spirit-Generation*, the Most High declares: "I employ the qi of the Dao to enact transformation, taking as model the Qian and Kun, yin and yang. The two halves temporarily conjoin to form a human, and the numinous consciousness is transformed, each assigned a governing office and title."

As the *Dao Parable* states: the spirits of the body listed above are called the Hundred Demons. The *Central Yellow Scripture* says: "First is the Upper Corpse, Peng Ju, dwelling in the brain. Second is the Middle Corpse, Peng Zhi, dwelling in the Hall of Light. Third is the Lower Corpse, Peng Jiao, dwelling in the stomach and abdomen." Each is seven inches long, congealed qi forming spirits, resembling newborn infants. Their nourishment and defense circulate, transforming naturally, in harmony with Heaven and Earth.

Every *Gengshen* day, they depart the human body, ascending to the Thirty-Six Bureaus of the Three Offices of Tai Xuan, and descending to align with the records, reporting good and omitting evil. The Mysterious Emperor oversees the office of the Tai Xuan Marshals, and cases are sent down to the earthly realm to restrain and suppress the affairs of the Hundred Demons, preventing their reckless entry into and exit from the human body.

Once each month on the appointed day, they descend to the lower realm. Moreover, during the Three Primes, Eight Nodes, *Jiazi* and *Gengshen* days, and the Three Sixes, they assist in the creation of the Dao. Additionally, a fixed system of twelve annual cycles is established, wielding the authority of the Three Realms’ Grand Marshal. Following the monthly appointed days, cases are issued throughout the world to uphold and protect the altars of state, universally blessing the Qian and Kun.

The specific days of descent are recorded in the subsequent section under the "Ten Caverns’ Roaming Inspections." Thus, the true wanderings and meritorious deeds of the Mysterious Emperor extend throughout the seas within and beyond, their manifest responses resplendent. Those who receive grace are numerous, and those who praise are many—all recorded in the annals, now fittingly annotated.

Rewarding good and punishing evil: all human good and evil arise from the karmic summoning of the three actions of body, speech, and mind. Who does not receive a full harvest of retribution? The true office of the Mysterious Emperor constantly admonishes with matters of reward and punishment.

The *Records of Divine Manifestation* state: In the early Xianping era of the Song dynasty, Cheng Sichang, a merchant from Xinghua Prefecture in Fuzhou, was habitually fond of vegetarianism. While traveling in Mizhou and staying at Jiaoqiao Town, he witnessed hunters cruelly capturing flying birds. Unable to bear the sight of innocent lives being slaughtered, he resolved to print and distribute the *Precepts Against Killing* from his family’s collection. After the woodblocks were carved, on the seventh day of the eleventh month—the descent day of the Perfected Warrior—he burned incense, knelt in reverence, and prayed to the void, saying, "The flying birds of this place die without cause. I beseech the sagely protection to transform the people through this text and guide them toward goodness."

On the day of distribution, the tax barrier chief, Peng Jing, was the first to request a copy. He pasted it on his wall. Unexpectedly, his wife, Hua Sanniang, upon hearing the recitation, flew into a rage, tore the text to pieces, and cast it into filth. She then bought a black carp and, wielding a knife, slaughtered it. The fish thrashed its tail, injuring one of Sanniang’s eyes. Blood spattered the ground, and she wailed in agony. The blood transformed into maggots, and no physician or shaman could cure her. Jing sought out Sichang to berate him, but upon arriving, found him already deceased, seated upright in meditation.

Shortly after, before the town’s garrison hall, Cheng’s body was seen suspended in midair, standing.

The patrol inspector Xuan Dan, sensing the strangeness at dawn, burned incense and inquired of Cheng. The apparition hastily replied: "I am the Perfected Warrior of the Central Heaven. I have observed that the residents of this land, over countless kalpas, have wantonly slaughtered living beings to sate their appetites, amassing grave karmic obstructions—yet their retribution has not yet manifested. First, I revealed Hua’s crime of destroying Cheng Sichang’s exhortative text, decreeing her an evil death as just recompense, for retribution admits no escape. As for the other transgressors, let them heed this warning."

With these words, the vision vanished.

At that time, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Works, Xiang Guo, passing through on his mission to oversee the mountains and marshes, heard the rumors and questioned Xuan Dan, who presented Cheng Sichang’s handwritten ode. It read:

*"I spare no living breath,
And Heaven grants me a virtuous name.
If still you doubt this truth,
Behold how clear the karmic reckoning."*

Having read it with reverence, he took the text back with him. Upon returning to court, he reported the matter to Emperor Zhenzong, who praised and bestowed posthumous honors, affirming the numinous efficacy of the Perfected Warrior. The event was recorded in the ritual canon, and the imperial composition declared:

*"One Spirit of the Three Primordials,
Responding through the Ten Gates,
Radiant with auspicious light,
All true, all-pervading, vanquishing the demonic."*

Thus, the August Emperor acknowledged the Dark Sovereign’s decree: that Cheng Sichang’s exhortation to a hundred virtues be recorded, and Hua’s punishment as a wicked woman serve to chastise a hundred evils.

*The Book of Stimulus and Response* states: "One who has committed evil deeds but later repents, refraining from all wrongdoing and practicing all virtues, shall in time surely attain good fortune—transforming misfortune into blessing."

To uphold the upright and expel the perverse: the sovereign, revered as the exemplar for all people, sets the standard. When the standard is upright, what in the world will not be set right? Governance lies in fostering loyalty, and ministers aid the people in fully realizing their nature.

Thus, the emperor, wielding the unseen authority of the state, distinguishes the true from the mundane to uphold the upright in governance. How could usurpers and licentious rebels long harm the nation?

*The Record of the Sage’s Manifestation* recounts: After Emperor Gaozong of Tang passed, his coffin stood before the court as the Crown Prince Yuwang ascended the throne. At the time, Empress Wu held power and exiled the emperor to Fangzhou. She then elevated her cousin’s son, He Quanlong, to the post of Regional Inspector and appointed him Palace Observation Envoy, though he devoted himself solely to sorcery. He falsely styled himself the "Seven Essences of the Northern Culmen, Dharma Aide to the State."

The empress, favoring him, allowed Quanlong to wield unchecked authority, slandering and demoting officials. Suddenly, word came of an emergency in the Taichuan region: the western chieftain Zhao Hong, leading demonic troops, had invaded, his forces comprising serpents, tigers, smoke, fire, and a hundred monstrous apparitions. The local command dared not advance.

The ministers proposed sending He Quanlong with his Seven Essences Dharma to repel the threat. Empress Wu approved, and the Privy Councilor Cui Cha bestowed talismans and dispatched three thousand troops to confront the enemy. Half the army perished, and three of Quanlong’s household servants were lost. Helpless, Quanlong watched as the borderlands teetered on collapse.

The court ministers deliberated again and petitioned to summon Pei Tao, a Yellow Gate Attendant, and his sixteen-year-old son, Zhongfang, whose appearance and talents were extraordinary. They were certain he could defeat Zhao Hong’s demonic horde. The empress summoned him, bestowed the title of Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, and granted him five hundred soldiers, exempting him from the usual court farewell.

Returning home to pay respects to his parents, he girded his sword and led his troops straight to the enemy lines. With a sweep of his blade, he routed the foe—Zhao Hong fell from his horse, his troops frozen, his sorcery dissolved. The enemy was captured and brought back to the capital.

Hastening to see Empress Wu, he was invited to ascend the dais and sit. The empress soothed him, saying, "We know you are a divine being."

The Grand Master then exposed He Quanlong’s affair with the fox spirit Yuan Gang, whose sorcery had sullied the nation’s dignity. Though the empress still favored Quanlong, she ordered him to bring hundreds of his household servants into the palace for a public trial of the Seven Essences Dharma.

When Quanlong arrived, he gnashed his teeth and spat water to conjure clouds and mist, sending his servants soaring into the air. He unleashed violent winds, hail, and sleet. Zhongfang brandished his sword and summoned them—one by one, they fell, drawn into his scabbard. He then invoked true fire and incinerated them with a spell.

Thereupon, the assembled ministers celebrated the return of peace, and a general amnesty was proclaimed throughout the land. In the ninth month of the first year of the Tongtian era, the reign title was changed to Shen’gong.

Afterward, the Grand Master took leave of his parents, saying, "I came from Heaven; now I depart to the North." With these words, he bowed and sat in meditation, his body ascending into the clouds amid celestial music. Slowly, he drifted toward the northern skies.

The matter was reported to the throne, and he was posthumously enfeoffed as the Divine Responsive General. Pei Tao resigned his office and requested that his residence be converted into a Daoist abbey. The empress consented, bestowing upon Tao the title Divine Responsive Celebrated Layman of Purity, and the abbey was named accordingly. The Tang dynasty’s fortunes were thus revived.

This was the Dark Sovereign’s warning to later generations of ministers: let none establish themselves as treacherous villains, for those who transgress shall without exception be cast out. Moreover, let people harbor upright thoughts, and they shall surely attain the true and mysterious. Let perverse thoughts not take form, lest they immediately incur dire consequences.

The salvation of celestial and mortal beings lies in the six elements—water, fire, wood, metal, earth, and grain—which arise from the earth and are perfected by Heaven, sustaining human life from birth to death. Thus, the ruler is the people’s Heaven, and food is the Heaven of destiny. The people rely on the ruler for peace, just as the ruler is established by the people. Yet even so, there may come years of famine and scarcity, for such is the work of Creation.

Only a virtuous ruler, in his exalted power, can dissolve calamities, transform disasters into blessings, and succor the myriad people. According to the *Records of the Divine Manifestation*: In the first year of Xiande during the Later Zhou, when Emperor Taizu of Song was leading his forces on campaign against Ying Prefecture, he encountered an immortal at dusk who secretly revealed the signs of his future greatness, saying, "You shall receive the hidden aid of the True Warrior." With these words, the immortal vanished in a flash of light. Taizu, firm in his faith, performed rites of thanksgiving and supplication, and soon thereafter he indeed received the abdication of the Zhou, establishing the Song dynasty. He changed the reign title to Jianlong and rewarded his armies throughout the realm. Only Ying Prefecture was found wanting, and Chen Chou submitted a memorial requesting that the five hundred thousand strings of cash deposited in the imperial treasury by foreign merchants be borrowed to fund the border garrisons and rewards.

The imperial assent was granted, and the funds were dispatched to Zheng, the fiscal commissioner of Gaoyang Pass. Later, the foreign merchants Yi Shouxian and others arrived at the bureau. Chen Chou, having purified himself, submitted a memorial to the court, detailing the matter of the deposited funds. He explained that the Prince of Zhao had previously received an omen from the Star of Venus, and in gratitude, had burned offerings of money and silk to the True Warrior, our gracious patron. Upon reviewing the memorial, it was discovered that an additional fifty thousand strings of cash remained. The Prince of Zhao had sent the merchants to exchange them, and all the wealth was now under his management for his use.

When the merchants finished speaking, they vanished. Chen Chou reported the matter in full, and upon reading his memorial, the emperor was overcome with joy and gratitude.

By the second year, on the first day of the third month, the hundred officials accompanied the emperor to ascend the Hall of Illuminated Virtue, where they deliberated on the various regional lords and kings, each entrenched in their mountains and rivers, their repeated campaigns yet unconquered.

Suddenly, a dense black mist enveloped the hall’s forecourt, obscuring all sight. Chancellor Zhao Pu alone invited the emperor to ascend the Hall of Filial Accomplishment. As they took their seats, a divine figure appeared amidst the clouds above, bowing reverently to the emperor before descending to address him: *"The imperial foundation stands firm, its destiny newly flourishing; like Yao and Shun, you must summon the right men to aid your reign. Beware the folly of later rulers who gained the throne through excess, lest treacherous rebels stain your rule with chaos."*

The Great Ancestor personally inquired, *"What office does the sage hold?"*
The figure replied, *"I am no earthly spirit but serve as the Right Victorious Prefect of the Heavenly Capital. Bound for Yan territory, I overheard your concerns and paused to report: I have just returned from the Three Heavens, where I learned that the Song’s usurpation shall not exceed the span of a reign. The Way of Heaven is just."*

As Zhao Pu bowed in gratitude, the True Warrior took his leave and ascended.

In the autumn of the third year of Jianlong, reports arrived from the two circuits of Hebei: two years of drought had left the military and people without grain, a dire crisis no official could resolve. Then, on the seventh day of the seventh month at dawn, twenty commanderies and prefectures each found their cities piled high with heaps of millet and wheat, their sacks stitched with markings of black cloud and horse paper. The goods had no owner, no porters, and the prefectures, after verifying one another’s accounts, memorialized the court.

The Three Departments reviewed the matter and issued a decree: *"How could such goods lack an owner? This is the virtue of our dynasty moving the True Warrior to release grain from the Heavenly Granary to relieve the two circuits."* In total, some 150,000 *shi* of grain were distributed at low prices to revive the starving military and people.

Upon hearing this, the emperor exclaimed in joy, *"Such grace is no small matter—how dare we not repay it?"* On the day the True Warrior descended, the emperor personally attended the Hall of the Dark Capital, offering incense and reverence.

According to the *Descended Writings of Master Dong*, the Dark Emperor governs through the Dao and virtue, embodying the silent, effortless success of Heaven and Earth. He never ceases to care for all beings, nor does he abandon the lands below for even a moment. Whenever he foresees calamity, he first petitions the Golden Gates with sincerity to mitigate its severity. Even among the rebellious tribes and those who disrupt the Central Kingdom, he extends his teachings, truly the Great Compassionate Savior and Supreme Dharma King.

He dispels demons and neutralizes poisons—wherever lands are afflicted by malevolent forces or plagues, it is invariably due to the people’s transgressions and karmic defilements. As the saying goes, *"Heaven shows no favoritism; only virtue is its support."* When the noble ruler rectifies his heart, he naturally invokes the awe-inspiring radiance of the Divine, dispelling and restraining all inauspicious events.

The *Records of the Divine Manifestation* state: Zhao Guangzu of Shanzhou, deputy strategist under the Right Victorious Prefecture, was demoted to assist the Song for over thirty years. By the early Taiping Xingguo era, he was appointed Grand Scholar of the Hall of Illustrious Literature and Right Remonstrating Censor, before passing away and returning to his post in the Northern Culmen.

His younger cousin, Shi Guangsi, Minister of Rites and Reader-in-Waiting of the Ministry of Rites, was dispatched to govern Hongzhou and concurrently oversee the regions of Tan, Ding, Heng, E, and Jing. These lands bordered the barbarian tribes, where seventy-two ferocious spirits and rampant demonic toxins wantonly claimed lives. The people there, estranged from the true teachings and ignorant of medicine, indulged in heterodox practices, sacrificing to southern deities. They called their sorcery *"Vajra Dharma Rites,"* employing oil, fire, and blades to summon frenzied spirits, with shamans deceiving households to extort wealth.

Guangsi forbade these practices and, unable to suppress them, commanded the Daoist Dan Jumiao of Luofu Grotto to perform a grand *zhang* ritual, fervently praying to the True Warrior. He distributed sacred tablets bearing the deity’s name and taught the people the proper rites. On the days of the deity’s descent, they chanted scriptures and incantations for months on end, until the heterodox practitioners, ferocious spirits, and demonic toxins all vanished into hiding.

Elsewhere, Chen Gongchen of Huaiyang Commandery, a presented scholar, had kept an unusual young tortoise since childhood, feeding it only jujubes. In the year Gongchen passed the imperial examinations, the tortoise suddenly grew large. One night, its shell bore a coiled red serpent. Recognizing this as an auspicious sign, Gongchen commissioned a hall of portraits depicting the True Warrior and enshrined them for worship, with every prayer answered.

Later, as Gongchen was promoted to Assistant Magistrate of Xinyang, he was unexpectedly appointed by the Fiscal Commissioner Fei Qiang to supervise the construction of city walls and manage the laborers. That winter, an epidemic spread, afflicting the military and people and halting the work. As Gongchen sat in distress, he suddenly heard the tortoise speak before him: *"I have learned of the epidemic among your laborers and come to offer an incantation for dispelling it: 'Celestial Stem, Celestial Branch, swiftly drive away the storm. Bestow upon me this hidden merit, and may the madness depart at once.' Recite this thrice while inhaling *qi*, then exhale into a water basin. Sprinkle the water with willow branches to cleanse the afflicted, and they shall recover. This is my repayment for your care. I now return to my duties in the Northern Culmen."*

As the tortoise finished speaking, Gongchen awoke. He performed the ritual, and its efficacy was immediate. Soon after, a letter arrived from home—his tortoise had vanished at the very hour of his dream.

Upon the completion of the city’s repairs, Gongchen reported the matter to the Transport Commissioner, who submitted a detailed memorial to the throne. The imperial court issued a decree ordering the construction of a dual shrine to the Water and Fire Deities at the Xinchang City site, with the incantation to be engraved in stone for the perpetual salvation of the people.

Emperor Huazong posthumously bestowed titles upon the two deities:
The Divine Tortoise was ennobled as *Divine Tortoise of Harmonious Virtue, Auxiliary Administrator of the Supreme Dao, Manifest in Martial Clarity, Wielding Hidden Might to Uphold the Sagely Left, Righteous Attendant of the Cloud Cavalry, Guardian of the State, Protector of Peace, Assistant in Solemnity to the Primordial Origin, Great Celestial Marshal of the Left of the Supreme Unity*.
The Sacred Serpent was ennobled as *Sacred Serpent of Harmonious Virtue, Benevolent Protector of Profound Grace, Solemn in Majestic Compassion, Universally Aiding the Hidden, Executor of Martial Sagacity, Righteous Attendant of the Right, Cloud Cavalry Defender of the State, Keeper of Tranquility, Guardian of the Primordial Mystery, Great Celestial Marshal of the Right of the Supreme Unity*.

Thus was the imperial will fulfilled. This was earnestly carried out.

*(The repetition of "Thus was the imperial will fulfilled. This was earnestly carried out." reflects the Jade Page’s report to the Dark Warrior General in compliance with the command.)*

The Dark Warrior declined the ennobled office and, departing the Northern Culmen’s palace, proceeded at once to the Right Victory Prefecture to assume his appointed duties.

Here ends *Scroll the First of The Supreme’s Exalted Scripture of the Divine Incantations of the Original Transmission of the Great Sage Perfected Warrior of the Dark Heaven*.
*Scroll the Second of The Supreme’s Exalted Scripture of the Divine Incantations of the Original Transmission of the Great Sage Perfected Warrior of the Dark Heaven* begins.

Within the marketplace dweller’s abode, Fang Tianzi and Pei Shengxuan of the Ascended Mystery received the Inner Teachings Register, while Chen Zhong compiled the annotations. At that moment, a Perfected One named Wondrous Conduct emerged from the ranks, prostrating himself before the Celestial Throne. He declared: "This servant, by past karmic affinity, has been granted to hear the wondrous principles. The Great General of the Northern Quarter, the Dark Warrior General, patrols and inspects the affairs of heaven and humanity, recording good deeds and punishing evil—yet I know not by what karmic cause this General manifests, nor what divine powers he possesses, nor how he subdues gods and spirits. At every court assembly, the tallying and binding of records never cease for even a moment. Now that the foundational rites are complete, may I humbly inquire into these karmic matters? I pray the Great Creator may grant me the slightest awakening, the smallest wisdom."

Among the Ten Poles, the titles of Perfected Ones all bear the name "Wondrous Conduct," yet none surpass those of the Eastern Pole, who lead the ranks. As *Zhuangzi* states: "Only with Perfected Ones does true knowledge arise." Citing this, the August Sovereign of the Void and Lofty declared: "To unite with the True and Constant, without fixed appearance—what could be more wondrous?"

All present at the assembly strictly observed their ranks, save for Wondrous Conduct of the Eastern Pole, who stepped forth, prostrated himself before the Purple Tenuity Emperor, and recited his past vows. Having heard of the Dark Warrior’s wondrous karmic causes, he now entreated to praise the Great Creator’s design and seek the slightest awakening, the smallest wisdom.

The character for *Dao* is "Great"; the name for transformation is "Creation." To revere the Great and embody transformation—this is sageliness. Such a sage indeed possesses the sixfold divine knowledge, capable of commanding and subduing gods and spirits.

At that time, the Great Emperor, veiling his transcendence in mortal guise, replied: "How wondrous, Perfected One, that you act on behalf of the mortal realm! Yet the Dark Warrior’s karmic manifestation is vast and boundless, subtle and unfathomable." (Here, "veiling his transcendence" means concealing his divinity.) Hearing the plea, the Purple Tenuity Emperor leaned forward over his imperial desk, addressing the assembly with admiration for Wondrous Conduct’s earnest inquiry. The Dark Warrior’s manifested powers and sacred duties are indeed profound—thus does Wondrous Conduct serve the mortal realm, awakening the desires of worldly beings, that they may know of the celestial Dark Warrior, cultivate their mortal forms, and attain the sixfold knowledge to govern the merits and transgressions of the Three Realms.

"Vast and boundless" describes his transformations as limitless, pervading all without exception, beyond all tracing. "Subtle and unfathomable" describes his divine changes as inscrutable, embracing all without limit, beyond all comprehension.

According to the *Register of the Sixfold Knowledge from the Upper Chapters of the Numinous Treasure’s Wisdom*: The divine eye’s knowledge sees with lofty wisdom, its crimson pupil gathering the five hues of light, perceiving all without obstruction—above and below, in the four directions and eight quarters—nothing unseen, nothing unclear. The divine ear’s knowledge hears with distant wisdom, its primordial aperture in the void gathering the five sounds, resonating with all vibrations, hearing the Nine Heavens above and the Nine Earths below—nothing unknown, nothing unexamined. The divine nose’s knowledge breathes with empty wisdom, its ethereal cavity gathering the five qi, naturally penetrating yin and yang, coming and going without gate. The divine mouth’s knowledge tastes with subtle wisdom, its harmonious orifice gathering the five flavors, embracing all without rejection, containing all without limit. The divine heart’s knowledge discerns with luminous wisdom, its tongue governing the five spirits, its radiance traversing the ten thousand directions—swift without haste, arriving without movement. The divine hand’s knowledge grasps with profound wisdom, presiding over humanity, regulating the four seasons, its dark sequence permeating the nine subtleties, seizing the origins of life, corresponding to the Celestial Gate above, discerning fortune and misfortune in the hidden.

Thus, the Dark Emperor, by upholding these great precepts, dwells in the mortal realm yet masters the desires of eye, ear, nose, mouth, heart, and hand, thereby attaining governance and uniting his divine nature with the sixfold knowledge. Then his might extends over gods and spirits, and all external demons and inauspicious forces submit at the mere rumor of the Dark Emperor.

For he is the Mysterious Origin Sage Ancestor, protector and deliverer of heaven and humanity, a manifested body of divine subtlety. The Dark Emperor Sage Ancestor is the primordial qi. He is the revered deity of the Three Treasures.

The Heavenly Treasure Lord presides over the primordial qi at the dawn of scripture, known as the Highest Great Possession Jade Clarity Palace. The Numinous Treasure Lord presides over the original qi at the deliverance of humanity, known as the Upper Clarity Mysterious Capital Jade Capital Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Palace. The Divine Treasure Lord presides over the mysterious qi at the revelation of scripture, known as the Three Sovereigns’ Grotto Spirit Supreme Clarity Grand Ultimate Palace. All issue forth the Great Possession Golden Script.

The Heavenly Treasure illuminates the light of heaven and earth; the Numinous Treasure awakens the souls of the Nine Dark Realms; the Divine Treasure governs the affairs of the myriad spirits. Thus do we know the grace of the Most High’s protection and deliverance, gradually guiding the faculties of humans and celestials toward perfection.

Those who preserve the spirit assist its transformations through divine knowledge. Those who perceive the luminous teach discernment to effect change.

The *Scripture of the Central Dipper* states: "The Great Dao is formless, ever dwelling in the profound and obscure. The holiest among the holy, the most numinous among the numinous, it encompasses all without exclusion, nurturing all beings." For the Dao, being formless, cannot be described by any image; its transformations are myriad, its emptiness unfathomable. This is the primordial qi—nothing else.

The Primordial Heaven generates Earth. The *Scripture of Purity* states: "The Great Dao is formless, giving birth to heaven and earth." The *Scripture of Responding to the Times* states: "The Great Void is imageless; when its simplicity scatters, it becomes humanity. Heaven arrays the images of sun, moon, and stars; Earth forms the shapes of mountains, rivers, seas, and peaks; humanity receives the essence of the five phases and yin-yang—all inheriting the ancestral qi, yet can this be spoken of as having form?"

*Xunzi* says: "Heaven does not speak, yet people revere its height; Earth does not speak, yet people revere its depth. How great are Heaven and Earth!"

Man, if not sincere, cannot transform the myriad things. Thus, the Primordial Beginning enacts the teaching without words, and by force of naming, it is called the *Dao* for comparison.

That which transforms in myriad ways is number. Ten thousand makes ten thousand; a *zhao* is a hundred thousand, and a *yi* is a thousand thousand. A thousand thousand is called the Great Thousandfold World. The mechanism divides a hundred myriad within the Void, and this principle governs its operation. It encompasses the ten thousand heavens, governs the ten thousand realms, divides the ten thousand, illuminates the ten thousand things, transmits the ten thousand methods, controls the ten thousand spirits, gathers and summons the ten thousand *qi*, communicates the ten thousand transformations, repels the ten thousand demons, and does not cling to the ten thousand existences. Such profundities are unfathomable.

Moreover, the Mysterious Primordial Sage Ancestor manifested eighty-one times as Lord Lao. Within the Great Cavern Heaven, he is honored as the Precious Lord, and his inner title is the Mysterious Primordial Sage Ancestor. From the One he generated the Two, thereby opening the heavens of the Great Luo’s Three Realms, and his appellation became the Primordial Beginning. The Lord of the Cavern Mystery and Numinous Treasure, whose inner title is the Jade Dawn Void Sovereign, venerates the threefold light of the undying night, opening the celestial realm of the Nine Empyreans, and his appellation became the Great Dao Lord. The Lord of the Cavern Spirit and Divine Treasure, whose inner title is the Mysterious Primordial Latter Sage, governs the eighty-one *qi* of the ninefold nine, arranging the eighty-one yang heavens, and his manifest appellation became Lord Lao.

The *Scripture of the Primordial Origin* states: "Lord Lao’s countenance resembled that of a child; his beard and hair were hoary white. His inner title in heaven was Laozi." The *Scripture of the Teachings of the Branches* states: "The Primordial Beginning therefore commanded Laozi to incarnate among humanity, whether among the Yi or the Xia, changing his name with the times, expounding precepts and admonitions, and initiating the deliverance of all conditioned beings."

According to the *Comprehensive Tortoise of the Daoist Canon*: During the High Antiquity of the Upper Three Sovereigns, he was called the Mysterious Master of the Ten Thousand Heavens, revealing the Great Law of the Mysterious Center to the world. During the Middle Three Sovereigns, he was called Master Yougu, revealing the *Scripture of Grand Simplicity* to the world. During the Lower Three Sovereigns, he was called the Perfected of the Golden Portal, revealing the *Secret Scripture of the Golden Portal* to the world, teaching the people the Way of Grand Peace and non-action.

In the age of Fuxi of High Antiquity, he was called Master Yuhua, revealing the *Scripture of Primordial Yang* to the world and teaching the Way of following one’s nature and destiny. In the age of Shennong, he was called Master Dacheng, revealing the *Scripture of the Primordial Essence of the Great One* to the world and teaching the Way of cherishing life. In the age of the Yellow Emperor, he was called Master Guangcheng, revealing the *Scripture of Daoist Admonitions* and teaching the study of soaring flight. In the kingdom of Pure Joy, he was called the Purple Primordial Lord, bestowing upon the Mysterious Emperor the *Jade Void Precepts of Grand Harmony*, teaching the supreme precepts of wisdom and the Way of returning to the root.

In the Middle Antiquity of Shaohao, he was called Master Hongmeng in the world. In the age of Zhuanxu, he was called Master Chijing. In the age of Emperor Shun, he was called Master Lutu. In the age of Emperor Yao, he was called Master Yinshou. In the age of Emperor Shun (again), he was called Master Wucheng. In the age of Yu of Xia, he was called Master Zhencheng. In the age of Tang of Shang, he was called Master Xize. In the age of King Wen of Zhou, he was called Lao Dan, serving as the Archivist beneath the Pillars. He revealed the *Two Scriptures of Virtue and the Dao* to the world. At that time, the Keeper of the Pass, Yin Xi, received his teachings. Now, he has been posthumously appointed as the Grand Preceptor of the Great Luo Jade-Pure Sacred Realm, presiding over the affairs of the Heavenly Pivot Institute.

*Zhuangzi* states: "Guan Yin and Lao Dan were the vast and great true persons of antiquity. Serene and formless, their transformations were constant." The immortal elder Ge Hong said: "Laozi is the spirit of heaven and earth; he appears in every age." Eighty-two times he transformed into the Dark Warrior. The name Dark Warrior was established in the later heavens.

According to the *Veritable Record of Planchette Revelations*, the Dark Warrior was originally the transformation of the Five Numinous Primordial Elder of the primordial *qi*, a manifestation of the Primordial Beginning and an alternate embodiment of the Supreme Ultimate. During the Upper Three Sovereigns, he descended as the Perfected of the Grand Beginning. Kong Yingda’s commentary on the *Laozi* states: "The Dao generates the One—this is the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Modes." During the Middle Three Sovereigns, he descended as the Perfected of the Grand Initial. The sun and moon were within the Grand Simplicity, their radiance emerging in the Grand Initial. During the Lower Three Sovereigns, he descended as the Perfected of the Grand Simplicity.

According to the *White Tiger Discourses*: "Once form and omen were established, it was called the Grand Simplicity." This was when Suiren established the Way of human marriage. During the age of the Yellow Emperor, he was born in the kingdom of Pure Joy as a prince, and his Daoist appellation was Master Qianyun. For his meritorious service in the Dao, the Jade Emperor bestowed honors upon him, first granting him the title of Mysterious Emperor.

The Great Dao, by the prior investiture of the Primordial Beginning Emperor, bestowed upon the Five Numinous Primordial Elder the charge of opening the north and summoning water, thereby establishing the root of the primordial yellow and planting its image. Gradually, the *qi* divided and transformed into form. The first was the office of the Supreme Emperor. Reverently manifesting these transformations: the Grand Beginning Heavenly One, the two bodies of the Grand Initial and Grand Yin, the celestial bodies of Chenxing, Yuebo, the Dipper, Ox, Girl, Void, Danger, Chamber, and Wall—twenty-nine bodies; the six Jia and the Ren and Gui—eighteen bodies; the Grand Simplicity’s northern prison of Hai, Zi, Chou, Qian, and Kan—seven bodies; the wind, thunder, rain, lightning, and thunderclap—fifteen bodies; the Qiang Elder, the Eight Slayers, and the human stars—ten bodies. The body of the Mysterious Emperor was the eighty-second transformation.

Thus, it is known that the Dark Warrior is the transformed body of Lord Lao and the numinous verification of the Military Star. Lord Lao’s alternate title is the Supreme Emperor of the Primordial Origin, the Supreme Ultimate as spoken of in the *Book of Changes*. The *Scripture of the Supreme Ultimate’s Division and Transformation of the Grand Beginning* states: "The Dark Warrior is the transformed body of Lord Lao. The Great Emperor and humanity regard him as comparable to the Military Star’s manifestation of numinosity, for the meritorious virtues of the two sages are quite similar."

According to the *Scripture of the Original Birth of the Northern Dipper*: "In the first kalpa of the Dragon Han era, there was the Lady of Purple Light, consort of the King of the Upper Yu Kingdom. One spring day, while she was strolling and playing by the Warm Jade Pool, she removed her garments to bathe. Suddenly, she was moved by the lotus bud, which opened into nine petals, and within it were born nine sons. The lady protected and nurtured them in the palace, her aspiration being only to raise them as sages to assist and support heaven and earth."

The nine sons, upon reaching maturity and donning their caps, each cultivated their conduct to perfection according to their stations. Their merits and practices fulfilled, they ascended to heaven in broad daylight and were all conferred noble offices in the Three Clarities.

The Heavenly August Emperor was the eldest son, assisting in the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace to regulate and transform the multitude of stars, presiding over the Purple Tenuity.

The second son of the Great Emperor aided in the Bright Hall of the North Culmen Central Palace, administering governance over the earth below.

Greedy Wolf, aligned with Heaven, served as the primal lord of the myriad things, extending life.
Gate of Ghosts, aligned with Earth, served as the primal lord of living beings, prolonging destiny.
Store of Wealth, aligned with the Sun, served as the fire-primal lord of emolument, preserving life.
Literary Brilliance, aligned with the Moon, served as the water-primal lord of emolument, augmenting destiny.
Integrity and Chastity, aligned with Earth, served as the river-primal lord of official rank, dispelling calamities.
Military Brilliance, aligned with Water, served as the river-primal lord of longevity, dispersing misfortunes.
Breaking Army, aligned with Metal, served as the sea-primal lord of wives and children, supporting decline.

According to the sixth fascicle of the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* in the *Commentary on the Cavern of Perfection*: "The jade name of the Military Brilliance auxiliary star is 'Chang of the Upper Primordial Realm'?" When cultivating, one upholds the Great Law of the North Culmen Heavenly Heart, saving beings and benefiting life. His Daoist appellation is "Great Chariot Master," and his virtue is titled "Perfected Lord of Stability." Before long, his merits complete and his practices fulfilled, he received the celestial edict to ascend, whereupon he was appointed Grand Master of Ceremonies in the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, wielding the jade register within the Dipper, holding the office of "Luminous Perfected August Emperor of the Heavenly Gate of Yang" in the Chamber of the Dipper’s House. Aligned with the governance of water, he oversees the river-primal, managing the promotion of immortals and transcendents.

Above, he governs the perfected of the Nine Heavens; in the middle, he commands the flying immortals of the Five Marchmounts; below, he records the progress of those who study the Dao, their accumulated merits and diligence, and all who qualify for promotion. He oversees their advancement, inscribing their names in the jade calendar, and administers the seasonal generation of earthly wealth, the disbursement of celestial granaries, and the treasuries’ receipts and expenditures.

Moreover, though the Dark Warrior was once an ordinary mortal—his cultivation spanning different kalpas since the beginning of the Kaihuang era—he fulfilled his heavenly duties. In all matters, he acted as one body, ever holding the welfare of the black-haired people at heart. Those who relinquished their numinous receptacles and received his grace were many. Thus, the two perfected ones, Purple Tenuity and Radiant Praise, manifested their numinosity in mutual verification.

The two asterisms, Void and Rooftop, commingle the dual essences of water and fire. In the north above the celestial center, they transform into the palace of primordial qi. Void and Rooftop occupy the twenty-sixth celestial division, spanning twenty-five and a half degrees, serving as the lodging for the sun and moon’s celestial courses, complementing the governance of the Solar Emperor and Lunar Sovereign. Here, water and fire reside.

In the year *guisi* of the Flame Emperor’s reign, on the first day of the first month, the day *wuwu* at dawn, the hour *jiayin*, the sun and moon conjoined in union. The two qi merged within the Void and Rooftop asterisms, their divine radiance streaming forth to descend upon the domain of Kui and Lou in the realm of Pure Joy. The Virtuous Victorious Empress, deep in slumber within her palace, her spirit wandering beyond her body, beheld an image of the sun’s round light entering her mouth. She swallowed it and awoke pregnant. By the year’s end, the Flame Emperor’s kingdom fell to Ban Spring, and the Yellow Emperor received the mandate, establishing his capital at Youxiong. In the year *jiawu*, he erected the Horse Standard.

The Lord of Pure Joy gave birth to a sagely son, born of the refined essence of Void and Rooftop, the crystalline flow of water and fire forming his body. In his prime, he received instruction and was transformed by the Dao of the Primordial One.

The *Essential Principles of the Dharma* states: "The Jade Void of Supreme Harmony, the Upper Capital of Purple Tenuity, the Five Constants revolve in curves, the Six Pitches guide the scriptures. Clarity becomes qi, mysterious refinement responds and spreads. The Emperor possesses wondrous methods, the Lord descends the Supreme Diagram. Its symbols pervade the Brahmā realms, its divine residence permeates all transformations. The gates of vast expedient means harbor no distinctions among the myriad wonders. No truth is not manifest, no Dao is not complete. In accord with transformation, in opposition to perverse paths, Heaven forms ten unions, Earth connects myriad ruins. Entering purity and emerging from chaos, responding to change in totality—this realm is the ultimate, its supreme name is the Great Mysterious Capital."

The *Veritable Record* states: The Purple Primordial Lord again transmitted the essentials of the Dao, enjoining him: "In the fourth kalpa of the Dragon Han era, you shall go barefoot and with unbound hair, gathering the true essence of Kan and Li, returning to the root and restoring your position between Void and Rooftop."

At times clad in armor and robed, at others booted yet barefoot, he ever wore his hair in dark blue locks, ever wielded his divine blade. Perfected Lord Dong said: "When the Dark Emperor received the mandate to descend to the lower realms to subdue demons, the Primordial Beginning issued a divine decree, prescribing such attire." As *Zhuangzi* says: "Heaven bestowed upon him form, the Dao bestowed upon him countenance."

His voice shook the Nine Heavens. Having been appointed the Wandering Envoy of the Nine Heavens and concurrently the Investigating Envoy of the Nine Heavens, he oversaw the scrutiny of merits and transgressions, the public affairs of immortals and transcendents. Thus, in the Brahmā Heaven above the Nine Empyreans, how could the Dark Emperor’s awe-inspiring renown not resound?

His might extended to the four quarters. He wielded the authority of the Great Overseer of the Three Realms, monthly inspecting the public affairs of ghosts and spirits across the Four Great Continents. From the east, where the Buddha of Origin was propagated in the Tai region, to the west, where the flowing sands of Jambudvīpa lie; from the south, where Jiaozhi of the Southern Continent resides, to the north, where the gloomy mounds of Uttarakuru stand—all city gods, garrison deities, armaments, soldiers, and horses were subject to his command. How could the gods of the four quarters fail in their duties before the Dark Emperor’s famed authority?

Those who rallied to him bore the black standard wreathed in dark mist; those who followed him were borne by a colossal tortoise and a giant serpent. When the Jade Clarity announced the bestowal of the black standard, it was on the first day of the first month of the first year of the Shousui reign. The raising of the banner, like the rising of dark mist, signified the majesty of his authority. Thereupon, ten billion valiant warriors beheld his banners and standards, all converging in faith, hastening to fulfill the commands of the Great Mysterious One.

Moreover, the Water Essence Forest Tortoise of the Earth’s Axis and the Fire Essence Holy Serpent of the Heavenly Gate bore and surrounded the Dark Emperor’s feet, executing punitive expeditions. The most formidable of all unruly and inauspicious qi between heaven and earth were the Heavenly Gate and Earthly Axis standards.

Divine soldiers and generals, numbering five hundred thousand, followed him; jade lads and jade maidens, arrayed in twenty-four ranks, attended him. "Ranks" here denote ordered rows. This office was the proximate bureau of the Right Victorious Mansion, subordinate to the Northern Numinous Officials. Thus, the left and right divisions managed his majestic regalia and recorded the good and evil deeds, merits and transgressions within the Three Realms.

According to the *Xianzhuan Shiyi* (*Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals*), it is recorded: Han Chancellor Zhang Liang, having withdrawn from the world to ascend to transcendence, held the title of "Great Mystery Lad." As the *Qisheng Ji* (*Records of the Awakening of the Sacred*) states: In Yiyang County of Xinzhou, there stands an imperially bestowed shrine to the "Reclusive Illuminating Filial Maiden," who was originally the Green Radiance Jade Maiden, registrar of the Right Victorious Mansion. Once, Lu Zhongdao and his wife, née Zhang, had long reverently tended the incense of Zhenwu. Though they sought an heir, in their later years, the wife dreamed one night of swallowing a red tassel and conceived, giving birth to a mute girl of unparalleled beauty. At thirteen, she suddenly spoke with crystalline clarity, bidding farewell to her parents: "I am originally the Green Radiance Jade Maiden of the Celestial Twin Maidens Palace. Yesterday, my elder brother, on account of our parents’ plea for an heir to Zhenwu of the North, reviewed the records of their karmic blessings and found no entry for male or female offspring. Yet Zhenwu, moved by their impartial sincerity in this world, memorialized the Three Heavens and received an imperial rescript to dispatch me, transforming into a red tassel to enter the womb. I was to inhabit a female form for a twelve-year term, after which I would return to the celestial assembly. When I departed the heavenly court, Zhenwu graciously instructed: ‘You must not speak while among mortals.’ Now, I have heard from the Song Dynasty’s Bureau of Astronomy that the stellar division of Chen corresponds to Yiyang County, where a hidden immortal of extraordinary destiny is destined to replace me. To avoid revealing celestial secrets, I must depart. Moreover, my allotted lifespan has expired, and I am to return to serve as vice-director of the Right Victorious Mansion’s Auxiliary Bureau, fulfilling duties for seven years before returning to the Twin Maidens Palace." With these words, she passed away. The matter reached the imperial ear, and she was posthumously enfeoffed with her present title. This serves as proof of the fixed allotment of jade lads and jade maidens to this bureau.

They bear the Numinous Talismans of the Northern Emperor. As the *Han Guan Yi* (*Han Dynasty Official Ceremonials*) states: "The *shou* (sash) signifies what one receives, distinguishing rank and manifesting virtue." When the Dark Emperor ascended, he was bestowed by the Golden Tower with the Northern Emperor’s talismanic plaque. Its head was perforated and threaded with a gold-embroidered, cloud-patterned purple-and-white ribbon, called the *shou*. The talismanic script on the plaque was in golden seal script: "The Great Mystery Marshal’s Dragon Script Talisman for Subduing and Transforming."

They wear the Treasured Seal of Qian Yuan. "To wear" means to bear jade pendants upon the body. The *Baihu Tong* (*Comprehensive Discussions in the White Tiger Hall*) records: "Thus, those who cultivate the Dao without end wear jade rings." When the Dark Emperor ascended, the Golden Tower bestowed upon him a jade seal with an interlaced knob, used to seal documents as a token of verification. The seal was named the "Qian Yuan Treasured Seal." The form of the talisman and seal wields authority, modeled after mortal script. One may imagine the celestial script, resplendent and luminous, coalescing into seal characters. Moreover, when the Dark Emperor was enfeoffed and promoted, his duties were augmented by six additional offices, and he was entrusted with six more talismanic seals. Their patterns, dimensions, and seal scripts remain unknown to the mortal world.

To command them are the Duke of Thunder and the Mother of Lightning; to drive them are the Earl of Wind and the Master of Rain. The affairs of the Right Victorious Mansion are overseen by the Heavenly Marshal Tianpeng, who adjudicates the Five Thunder Court, holding the office of "Celestial Great Duke of Thunder." Under his command are the envoys of wind, clouds, lightning, and rain, along with countless legions of flying dragon riders, aquatic marshals, river deities, and their thirty myriad troops, who ceaselessly forge and refine all things beneath the Celestial Realm.

When the Right Victorious Mansion executes punitive expeditions against demonic and unruly forces, these officers act as deputies, jointly upholding the great trust. They obey the commands of the battle standards, swiftly mobilizing their awe-inspiring might to assist in the chastisement of iniquity. According to the *Shangqing Fayin Shu* (*Esoteric Writings of the Highest Clarity*), the names, ranks, and titles of the male and female officials among the great sages are respectfully recorded as follows:

**Five Thunder Court, First Hall:**
Male Official: Wu Tian’an, "Thunder Court Marshal, Great General of Thunderclaps, Penetrating Heaven and Earth, Transforming and Manifesting, Searching and Seizing."

**Second Hall:**
Five Male Officials: "Nine Heavens’ Roaming and Hunting, Punishing the Wicked."

**Third Hall:**
Male Official: Wang Ming, "Thunder Court Commander, Star-Fire Blazing, Urging and Admonishing, Monitoring the Deeds of the Heart, Binding and Seizing Souls."

**Fourth Hall:**
Female Official: Wang Tian’an, "Thunder Court General, Slaying Malevolence and Capturing Dragons."

**Fifth Hall:**
Female Official: Wu Tianming, "Thunder Court General, Destroying Temples and Slaying Corpses."
Female Official: Tian Shouming, "Right Chief Administrator of the Northern Pole’s Exorcising Maidens, Thunder Court’s Four Seasons’ Lightning Affairs, Great Immortal Mother of Seeking Wickedness."

**Vice-Director of the Court:**
Male Official: Tian Shouzhen, "Thunder Court’s Urging Lightning, Erupting Thunder, Swift Thunderclaps, Fire Penetrating Heaven and Earth, Searching and Seizing the Wicked."

**Earl of Wind:**
Jin San, "Great Lord of Wind, Northern Pole’s Right Victorious Court’s Deputy Wind Master, Disciplinarian of the Eight Trigrams’ Wind Dispensation, Investigating Unlawful and Strange Wind Variations."

**Chief Recorder of the Five Thunder Court:**
Xin Hanchen, "Judicial Officer of the Five Thunder Court’s Registers, Annual Wind, Rain, Lightning, and Thunder Responses to Unruly and Demonic Matters."

**Master of Rain:**
Zhang Ya, "Divine Dragon of the Nine Heavens’ Transformation, Registrar and Sovereign of the Lower Prime’s Water Palace, Inspector of All Caverns’ Rain Dispensation, August Spirit-Responding Emperor."

He commands the Dragon Lords of the Five Lakes, Four Seas, Nine Rivers, Eight Streams, Seven Marshes, Twelve Valleys, and the external rain-dispensing cavern dragons—one hundred seventy in total, as recorded in the *Peacock Sutra*.

Now, the Five Thunders and Six Jia, the Eight Malevolent Stars—all are spiritual emanations of the Five Numinous Elder’s primordial qi, manifesting only when their present titles are invoked in offerings. As the *Huainanzi* states: "When thunder and lightning do not arise, wind and rain do not stir." Thus, the Five Thunders issue commands, lightning and fire punish the wicked, wind disseminates the Eight Trigrams, and rain nurtures with teachings, descending in perfect harmony to engender and complete the myriad things. Otherwise, thunder roars and thunderclaps crash, lightning and fire scorch and burn, winds rage and howl, rains pour with hail and sleet—these are not the signs of harmonious elegance but the celestial execution of punitive justice.

As the *Book of Songs* states: "Revere Heaven’s wrath, dare not jest or idle." Before and behind stand the Eight Malevolent Generals; to left and right attend the Six Jia Divine Marshals. These are the **Right Victorious Prefecture of the Mysterious Capital’s** **Northern Eight Malevolent Great Generals of Upholding Might**, whose eight encampments are stationed before the **Canopy Mountain of Fengdu Prison**. Now, with reverence, their names and ranks are revealed:

**Heavenly Malevolent General** Zhang Zishu,
**Earthly Malevolent General** Chen Ziqing,
**Solar Malevolent General** Li Zide,
**Lunar Malevolent General** Fan Zizhang,
**Aqueous Malevolent General** Du Zizhen,
**Igneous Malevolent General** Liu Zida,
**Metallic Malevolent General** Wang Ziyan,
**Stony Malevolent General** Jia Ziyuan.

The **Southern Six Jia Divine Marshals of Assisting Might**, whose six battalions array themselves beside the **Canopy Star of the Supreme Subtlety**, are likewise revealed with due reverence:

**Jiazi Water Marshal** Li Wensi,
**Jiaxu Earth Marshal** Li Shoutong,
**Jiashen Metal Marshal** Li Shouquan,
**Jiawu Fire Marshal** Li Shouzuo,
**Jiachen Wind Marshal** Li Shoujin,
**Jiayin Wood Marshal** Li Shouqian.

According to the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure*, when the **Primordial Beginning** expounded the teachings to deliver humanity within the **Verdant Heaven of the First Dawn**, a baleful upheaval arose in the northeast of the lower realms. Thereupon, the **Divine Duke** received the mandate to sweep away all inauspicious omens. At that time, the **Six Jia** clasped the **Golden Pass**, the **Seven Governors** guarded the **Numinous Altar**, the **Eight Might** sped like lightning, and the **Nine Phoenixes** shattered malevolent forces—all in accord with the **Mysterious Thearch’s** punitive decrees. Before and behind, firm and yielding; left and right, majestic and restraining. Thus was the **Golden Axe** wielded to execute the great celestial criminals, while lesser transgressors were met with retribution. To this day, such commands remain unchanged.

As the *Kaihuang Chapters* declares: "When the myriad demons submit in awe, the ten thousand lands are transformed to preserve peace and tranquility—such is the meaning."

The **Celestial Stem of the Great Unity** leads at the vanguard of the host. "Leads" denotes submission; "at" signifies fortunate attendance. The **Celestial Stem of the Great Unity**, too, is one of the **Five Virtue Divine Lords**, submitting in attendance to serve as an attendant official of the **Supreme Mystery**, ever prepared to enforce might as required. According to the original scripture: those who **escort** bear the **black banner** and **mysterious mist**; those who **follow** ride the **azure tortoise** and **mighty serpent**.

Now, the **Right Celestial Stem** presides over the **black banner**, styled **Inspector of Troops**, and serves as the **White Tiger’s Seven Malevolent Right General**, while the **Lesser Unity** beneath him, styled **Holder of Luminance**, is the **Black Warrior’s Five Malevolent Rear General**. It is said that the **Mysterious Heavenly Thearch’s** might pervades all divine and true beings. He is invested with the rank of **Northern Culmen’s Left Celestial Stem**, the **black banner** planted at the heart of the **Northern Asterism**, honoring its role in engendering and completing the myriad things. He is further invested with the office of **Heaven-Securing Black Warrior, Great Commander of the Three Realms**, and whenever he reverently executes Heaven’s punitive justice, his divine might does not kill wantonly. The **Lesser Unity** beneath the **Right Celestial Stem** is charged with overseeing matters of execution.

As the *Jade Register* states: "When the **dual essences of water and fire** are held in the palm, the **Three and Five** unite in shared merit." The **Three** is the **sacred serpent**, the **Five** the **divine tortoise**. Commanding the **Jia and Geng Marshals** within the **disciplinary framework**, the **Seven and Nine** are brought into harmonious regulation. The **Seven** tame the **azure dragons**, the **Nine** ride the **mysterious steeds**—thus it is known that in driving, restraining, and severing transformations, these marshals are most capable of securing control. **Earth Deities and City Gods** all fall under their command. "All" signifies universal compliance; "fall under" denotes institutional governance. **Earth Deities and City Gods**, present in every **state, prefecture, commandery, county, garrison, town, village, hamlet, and ward**, each hold such office, overseeing the **yin-shadow soldiers and clerks** to surveil affairs within their jurisdiction, all complying with the **Supreme Mystery’s** commands and institutional decrees.

In former times, when **Chaocheng** committed evil, the **Mysterious Thearch** swept it away, yet no **City God or Earth Deity** there had obeyed his commands. A Daoist adept was thus transformed to bear witness, and **Jiao Po** served as the local **Earth Deity**, heeding the Thearch’s directives. The *Records of Manifesting Sageliness* recount: "In ancient times, the four classes of **Chaozhou** grew violent, their wickedness accumulating over kalpas. They wantonly slaughtered living beings to glut their mouths and fatten their flesh, until even the clergy and Daoists emulated the vulgar ways, daily leaving blood and corpses strewn about, their foul vapors ascending to offend the sun, moon, and stars, extinguishing their light and luster. The **Nine Heavens’ Investigative Envoys** reported this to the **Celestial Court**, where the **Jade Emperor of August Heaven**, gazing forth from the **Three Heavenly Gates**, beheld the evil of **Chaozhou** in the **Wu region**. He commanded the **Celestial Minister, Purple Tenuity Thearch**, along with the **Officials of Earth and Water**, to dispatch the **Northern Culmen’s** **Prefectural Vice-Marshal of the Right Victorious Prefecture** to purge the land. The city sank beneath the waves, becoming a lake, forever cleansed.

**Zhenwu**, hastening to court to receive the decree, sighed and petitioned: 'Though this land spans a thousand *li*, not all its people are fated for calamity. I fear this may compound grievous wrongs. Permit your servant to descend and examine the local deities.' The **Great Thearch** replied: 'The **City God and Earth Deity** of this prefecture have already received the **Jade Emperor’s** edict and been transferred elsewhere.' Zhenwu then obeyed the decree and dispatched his subordinate, the **Right Celestial Stem**, to conduct a preliminary investigation. Descending, the latter transformed into a great turtle, dead and afloat upon the Han River. The officials, gentry, and common folk rushed to carve and devour its flesh, none abstaining. Zhenwu, witnessing this depravity, transformed into a wandering Daoist, traversing every door to seek water and verify the truth. Only at **Jiao Po’s** home did he find the virtue of non-killing, where pure water was offered.

Zhenwu said to Jiao Po: 'This city shall soon be swept away into a lake. Hasten to **Sacred Maiden Mountain** and dwell there as the **Earth Deity of the Lake and Mountain**.' With these words, he vanished. Jiao Po gathered her family and children-in-law and ascended the mountain. Upon arrival, she turned to look back and beheld a **black wind**, **torrential rain**, **thunderclaps**, and **raging waves**—in an instant, the city’s foundations vanished, submerged beneath the waters. Clasping her hands to her forehead, she suddenly saw a deity descending from the void, his appearance that of the Daoist who had sought water. He declared: 'These waters are now your domain.' The Daoist then ascended, and officials from neighboring prefectures arrived by boat to inquire of Jiao Po the cause. Each reported to their superiors, and Jiao Po’s family, one after another, passed away in due course."

The Western Jin dynasty enfeoffed her as the **Effulgent Divine Mother**, renaming the Lake Mountain after the Jiao clan—was this not by virtue of the **True Warrior’s** decree and command to preserve this office? All demons were eradicated, and no good was left unsupported. For **essence** is the transformation wrought by demonic beings; when they transgressed, none escaped extermination. Good people, through expedient means, benefited the world, and the unseen true administrators lent their aid.

The *Records of the Divine Manifestation* were compiled. For instance, when **Duke Wei**, **Han Qi**, governed **Daming Prefecture**, in the autumn of the second year of the **Qi-Ning** era (the *jiyou* year), an urgent report arrived from the Yellow River’s drought officials: "A monstrous **turtle spirit** has long emerged here, harming living beings. Now it has surfaced again upon the waters, stirring furious waves, collapsing embankments, and unleashing violent floods—none know how many lives have been swept away." Upon hearing this, the Duke swiftly dispatched his aide **Zheng Gui** and Vice-Administrator **Hua Dun** to manage the crisis. Arriving at the dike, the two donned their court robes, burned incense, and reverently invoked the **North Pole True Warrior**, saying: "We beseech your divine aid to assist Zheng Gui in slaying the demon." They then drew their bows and arrows, striking the turtle, which sank beneath the waters. The river’s flow returned to order, and the embankments were restored.

One night, Gui seemed to dream as two officials seized him, declaring: "We have been sent by the **Yama Palace** to summon you to testify regarding the killing of the turtle." They led him to a mountain prefecture, where the two officials murmured to each other: "The True Warrior descends here today." Gui, overhearing, said: "The **Wind-Swept Nether Mountain Prefecture** governs the reckoning of good and evil among the people of the upper and lower realms." As he followed them inside, he hastened to plead his case. A decree was issued, and the records of the aquatic beings were examined. Presently, the ledger revealed that the turtle’s former incarnation had been a man, born in **Da Yuan** in the Western Capital, named **Cheng Xuan**, the son of the chivalrous **Qi Ming**. He had governed **Yunmeng City** lawlessly, and on the day **Emperor Gaozong of Tang** dispatched the general **Chen Yuanzhong** to suppress the west, the city fell. Cheng perished in flames, and his soul was assigned as the **City God** of this region, where he wantonly demanded sacrifices and wrongfully took lives. The **Fengdu** authorities, learning of this, punished him by demoting him to the post of **Tide-Driving Sand-Shifting Earth Deity** within the **Four Scorching Regions** of the Yellow River in **Zhuozhou**. Then, in the third year of the **Xianheng** era (the *gengwu* year), his soul entered a turtle’s womb. Upon maturing, it migrated to the **Seven Pools** of the Yellow River within the borders of the **Great Song’s Northern Capital**, where it stirred floods for four hundred years, wrongfully claiming tens of thousands of lives.

The **Holy Judgment of the True Warrior** declared: "Though this turtle deserved to be dismembered in death, it still dares to lodge false accusations and demand redress from the officials of the mortal realm. Moreover, Zheng Gui acted under Duke Wei’s decree, and Han Qi shall soon ascend to the rank of **Perfected One of the Purple Palace**—I shall personally memorialize on his behalf." Gui bowed in gratitude and inquired further. The Sage dispatched a **talisman-bearing envoy** to escort the **divine turtle** and the attending official Zheng Gui to the **Yama Court** to present the case. The demonic turtle, still pleading for a reprieve, claimed its body had taken five hundred years to form. The King commanded the talisman envoy to manifest the divine turtle, which was enveloped in golden light and crushed into fine dust, scattered across the earthly administrations. Zheng Gui was permitted to return to life, and from that time forth, such calamities vanished from the mortal realm.

They ascended to the **Golden Portal** and proceeded to **Kunlun**, opening the **Gate of Heaven** and sealing the **Gate of Earth**, traversing the obscure and unfathomable to scrutinize the limits of fortune and misfortune. The **Golden Portal** is the general title for the imperial courts of the **Three Heavens of Great Purity**, where the **Celestial Thearchs** reside—namely, the **Jade Clarity Golden Portal**, the **Upper Clarity Golden Portal**, and the **Great Clarity Golden Portal**. **Kunlun** refers to the **Supreme Foundation**, the sacred mountain **Yu Jing** of the **Mystic Capital**, where the palaces of the **Three Heavens**—**Qingwei**, **Yuyu**, and **Dachi**—are established. In ancient times, the **Dark Thearch** was summoned to attend the **Primordial Beginning**; upon receiving his mandate, he acted with such merit among humans and spirits that he was appointed to govern separate domains, opening the yang and closing the yin—hence the phrase "opening the Gate of Heaven and sealing the Gate of Earth." At fixed intervals, he emerges from obscurity and enters tranquility, weaving through the myriad directions, traversing the **Three Realms** to scrutinize transformations and adaptations, bestowing deliverance as circumstances allow, encompassing all matters of action and inaction.

According to the *Veritable Records of the Descended Brush*, whenever the assembled perfected ones pay court to the **Jade Thearch of the Vast Heaven**, the **Four Saints** lead the procession, announcing their arrival. They reside in the **ren-gui** direction—*reside* meaning to dwell in stillness. When the **Great Ultimate** first divided into the **Two Modes**, the **Heavenly One** generated water, and the **Earthly Two** conceived fire, establishing the **ren-gui** direction. Positioned to the north of the **Purple Tenuity**, this aligns with the *Yi Jing*’s principle of **najiang**. **Ren** and **gui** are the purest essences of **qian** and **kun**: the active yang of **qian** generates **jia** and **ren**, while the passive yin of **kun** generates **yi** and **gui**, forming the harmonious qi of heaven and earth’s yin and yang. The stillness within **qian** transforms **ren** into the **li** sun, while the movement within **kun** transforms **gui** into the **kan** moon. Alternating between advance and retreat, waxing and waning, they embrace the **wu-ji** while carrying yin and holding yang, governing the transformation of the myriad things—truly the crucible of water and fire that forges souls and spirits.

According to the *Veritable Records of the Descended Brush*, the palace where the **Dark Thearch** resides is named the **Palace of Heavenly Unity and True Celebration**, situated in the northern reaches of the **Purple Tenuity**, between the **Supreme Elegance** and **Vast Emptiness** of the **Two Supreme Heavens**. Its towering halls are formed naturally from wondrous qi, adorned with jade-like trees, where divine winds chime in harmony with the **gong** and **shang** tones. Crimson light and purple mist perpetually shroud its heights—this is the **Realm of Jade Clarity, the Formless Realm**. Assisting him are the **Generals of Jia and Geng**, who may ride a **dark steed** or mount a **blue-green dragon**.

Those who assist do so to establish order and fulfill duties in accordance with the celestial arrangement. The **Generals of Jia and Geng** serve as the aides to the marshal, comprising four principal and deputy officers: **Jia, Xu, Geng, and Chen**. **Jia** embodies benevolence and love, while **Geng** upholds righteousness and propriety, enforcing decrees and commands. **Xu** embodies sincerity and trust, and **Chen** governs the breath and vital forces, following the **Big Dipper’s handle** and **celestial pivot**, akin to the roles of **Zaofu** and **Wang Liang**, or the **Left and Right Regulators**, overseeing the governance of the **Dark Thearch’s** **Stable of Dark Steeds** and **Dragon Enclosure**.

The principal and deputy generals **Jia and Xu** are charged with tending the **dark steeds**, guiding the reins and wielding the whip. According to the *Yi’s* **Na Jia** system, **Jia** corresponds to **Qian**, while **Xu** aligns with **Qian’s** companion star. Together, their positions lie between **Shi** and **Bi**, mirroring the celestial governance of **Zaofu** and **Wang Liang**. The principal and deputy generals **Geng and Chen** oversee the rearing and training of the **blue-green dragons**, assisting the officers in charge of swift flight and celestial navigation. In the *Yi’s* **Na Jia** system, **Geng** corresponds to **Zhen**, while **Chen** aligns with **Zhen’s** companion star. Their positions lie beneath **Jiao** and **Kang**, reflecting the celestial roles of the **Left and Right Regulators**.

To **ride** is to **drive**. The **dark steed** is of a deep black hue, standing eight *chi* in height. Known as the **Primordial Steed**, it originates from the **Celestial Chariot** in **Kui**, its essence derived from the *Yi’s* **Qian’s** vigor. **Qian** symbolizes the horse, harmonizing the **yin** register with **yang**, enabling its boundless and vigorous movement. To **mount** is to **straddle**. **Blue-green** signifies a verdant hue, while the **dragon** is a single-horned serpent. It is said to bear the **Dragon Horn**, a distinct region of the **Thearch’s Seat**. The *Yi’s* *Shuo Gua* states: **Zhen** embodies movement. **Zhen** represents the dragon, at times concealed, at others ascending within **yin**, ever attended by wind and rain. Its eyes flash like lightning, its brows stretch like cloud formations, its body spans a thousand *zhang*, and upon its head rest the **One or Two Celestial Terraces**.

According to the *Veritable Records of the Descended Brush*, when the **Dark Thearch** was yet mortal, he stood nine *chi* tall, his face round as the full moon, his brows arched like dragons, his eyes bright as a phoenix’s, his hair and beard flowing and resplendent, his complexion clear as ice. Upon his head rested a **Nine Qi Jade Crown**, and his body was clad in **Pine and Creeping Fig Robes**. After his ascension, whenever he descended to subdue demons and restrain spirits, his divine form expanded to a thousand *zhang*, his brows like clouds, his eyes like lightning. The **Three Terraces and Six Stars** served as his crown. The **Upper Terrace** governs **life and destiny**, its upper star corresponding to the **Son of Heaven**, its lower to the **Queen Consort**. The **Middle Terrace** governs the **imperial lineage**, its upper star corresponding to **dukes, princes, and kings**, its lower to **ministers and grandees**. The **Lower Terrace** governs **official emoluments and military affairs**, its upper star corresponding to **scholars and gentlemen**, its lower to the **common folk**. The **Three Terraces and Six Stars** of the **Supreme Subtlety** stand in pairs, their radiance cascading upon the **Dark Thearch’s** crown, a model later emulated by mortals in crafting their own headwear.

The *Astronomical Records* of the Jin states: The **Three Terraces** form the **Celestial Stairway**, where the **Great One** harmonizes **yin and yang**, governs the **cosmic principles**, and manifests the **verification of virtue and the proclamation of omens**. According to the **Talismanic Incantations of the Legalists**:
- The **Upper Terrace**, one and yellow, dispels misfortune like the pine.
- The **Middle Terrace**, two and white, protects the body and secures the household.
- The **Lower Terrace**, three and blue-green, cures illness and averts pestilence.

Thus, the **Three Terraces** descend in celestial manifestation, their divine radiance resplendent, illuminating virtue and obstructing transgression. In their **movement**, they mirror **Mountains and Waters Concealed**; in their **stillness**, they reflect **Heaven and Earth in Harmony**. Through these transformations, their **spiritual efficacy** is revealed.

According to the *True Treasury of Jade Essence of the Great Mystery Capital*, the **Ancestral Qi** transforms through the **Changes**, initiating the response to destiny. The **Primordial Chaos** conceals and reveals, its transformations intermingling. The **profound principles of movement, concealment, activity, and tranquility** form the method of **transmuting golden liquid into spirit**, refining it into hardness for daily application. The **Old Man of Mount Taihua** once said: Those who cultivate the **external** embrace the **boundless and infinite**; those who cultivate the **internal** attain the **formless and shadowless**. External cultivation refines the **Great Void**, while internal cultivation circulates **qi**. Thus, when the **external spirit** is at peace and the **internal qi** harmonizes, it is called the **reversal of spirit and the return to the primordial**.

**Movement and Concealment**—**Gen Mountain** as the **breath of the nose**, inhaling and exhaling the **qi of Kan**, circulating the blood with fluidity, nurturing **virtue** to achieve **sagely accomplishment**. The **Lord of Supreme Elegance and Joyous Heaven** said: Take **non-action** as the foundation for **above and below, left and right, front and back**, harmonizing **qi and spirit**, thereby perpetually attaining the **wondrousness of the natural**. This is called **entrusting the body to the practice of the Dao, transmitting the true mandate**.

**Stillness and Harmony**—**Kun Earth Mother** as the **Yellow One**, **Qian Heaven Father** as the **Ancestral Origin**, where **being and non-being** alternate, and **yang** emerges from within **yin**. The **Imperial Lord of Western Florescence** said: If one can rest and guide the breath with the spirit, knowing its source, one may perceive the **original spirit**, avoiding attachment to illusions or being seized by dreams. This is the **circulation of Kun’s spirit to transform into Qian’s image**.

According to the *Golden and Azure Hidden Communication of the Dragon and Tiger Superior Canon*: The sixty-four hexagrams all emerge from **Qian and Kun**, yet one must first pass through **Pi and Tai** before discussing **Zhun and Meng**. As **Zhang Pingshu’s** *Continuation of the Dao of the Yi* states: The **Dao of the Yi** wondrously encompasses the **substance and function of creation and transformation**, ultimately relying on **symbolic representation**. Upon careful examination of this text, the **One** is found within.

**Qian above and Kun below** form **Heaven and Earth in Stagnation**, with **Qian and Kun** as the **cauldron and vessel**. **Kun above and Qian below** form **Earth and Heaven in Harmony**, their interaction like the **sun and moon**. **Water and Thunder Zhun** guards the **One** and preserves the **Three**, halting the **moon’s hare and fire’s fowl**. **Mountain and Water Meng** achieves **sagely accomplishment and spiritual transformation**, circulating the **primordial chaos to nurture the original essence**. For humanity, all harmony derives from the **primordial qi of the One**. If one skillfully tends the **primordial cauldron** and adeptly circulates the **One Qi**, it is sufficient to transcend the **Five Phases** and attain the **true Dao**.

The *Returning to Life Chapter* states:
*East, south, west, north—master them well,*
*Intermingle Qian and Kun, the female and male.*
*Fire’s timing must be steadfast and precise,*
*Blowing and breathing rely on Xun’s wind.*

The *Scripture of Yin Convergence* states: *Heaven unleashes its killing mechanism, dragons and serpents rise from the land*—referring to the **Earth Gate** in the **Xun** position of the southeast, before the **last quarter moon**. **Kun** lodges its body in the **Earth Gate**, the **Earth Mother** seeking the **One**. From the **One**, **Zhun** is born; from the **Two**, the **Three** is sought, completing **Meng’s** difficulty and ease. Like qi seeking like, **hardness transforms into softness first**, enabling the spirit to have a measure and qi to have a flow.

**Movement follows the heavens**, roots sprouting in the **Xun** hour. Based on the **inner dynamics of Meng and Zhun’s** generation and completion, add the **Four Odds and Eight Evens**, symbolizing the **sun and moon’s** rightward revolution of **three hundred and sixty degrees**. Carry the **self’s earth** to nourish the **metal lead**, focusing the nose on inhaling the **true black of the beginning blue-green**, entering the **Muddy Pellet**. **Metal generates true water**, and the **fire timing of the fire-drill furnace** forges and refines.

The *Scripture of Hidden Correspondences* states: When humans unleash their killing mechanism, heaven and earth overturn—this refers to the northwest **Qian** position of the **Celestial Gate** after the first quarter moon. **Qian** originally occupies the Celestial Gate, while **Kun** has no fixed position; when the lunar phase approaches **Qian**, it is because **Qian** and **Kun** undergo three transformations, giving rise to **Pi** and **Tai** at the **Yin** and **Shen** positions. **Yin** generates **Li** fire to form **Ji** earth, while **Shen** generates **Kan** water to conceal **Wu** fire.

In stillness, one guards the earth, with roots in the **Qian** hour, while externally preserving the numerical strategies of **Qian** and **Kun**. **Pi** and **Tai** alternate daily like the heavens’ leftward revolution of three hundred and sixty degrees. **Wu** fire seizes **wood mercury**; next, with the tongue, one swallows thirty-six gulps of **Flowery Nectar**, transforming fire into true earth and transmuting spirit to command it.

The *Oral Instructions of the Dark Mystery and True Yang Perfected* states: "Within the body, use years and months; within the day, use hours and moments"—this means taking the day as the year and the hour as the season. Simply allow external spirits to shift and change while internally consolidating and nurturing qi. Externally, one should adapt to transformations in accordance with the times; internally, spirit becomes steadfast and qi solidifies. This method of cultivation is the most expeditious.

Lesser adepts encounter transformation and return to the true; true adepts open the path to ascend. The *Jade Purity and Great Clarity Chapter* states: The **Jade Purity** begins its transformation in the **Great Clarity**, evolving to the utmost extreme. Upholding correctness to enter the true, it transforms qi to seize impurities, rectifies and governs all spirits, refines treasures to reflect light, gathers the five constants into the infant, unifies the statutes and ordinances, delivers and uplifts sentient beings. When spirit descends and qi harmonizes, it preserves and refines perpetual tranquility, entering the realm of the true. All demons silently collapse.

This path is called the **Upper Realm**; scholars must attend to it with utmost care. From days to months to years, cultivate without pause or regression. The great achievement requires thirty thousand days; the lesser, one hundred days. Ascension follows the corresponding method for ordained practitioners. With utmost sincerity, swiftly cross the ocean of karmic deeds to ascend to the **Upper Jade Capital**.

Thus, it is known that the **Dark Emperor** cultivated for forty-two years to accomplish this supreme Way, attaining all divine penetrations.

Here ends the second scroll of *The Supreme’s Exalted Scripture of the Dark Mystery, the Great Sage True Martial’s Original Transmission, and the Wondrous Divine Incantations*.

---

The third scroll of *The Supreme’s Exalted Scripture of the Dark Mystery, the Great Sage True Martial’s Original Transmission, and the Wondrous Divine Incantations*.

**Fang Tianzi Pei Sheng**, a layman of **Chan**, received the **Inner Teachings Register**; **Chen Yong** compiled and annotated.

At that time, the Perfected One bowed twice and prostrated, saying: "This humble servant’s fortune is boundless to receive such a thread of discourse. The wondrous practice is praised, and the **Purple Tenuity** unfolds its teachings—this is the guiding principle of the warp and weft of the scriptures. Yet regarding the **Generals of the Dark Martial**, who are the emanations of the **Dark Origin**, how did their beginnings arise, and what were their affairs? I humbly request a detailed explanation to dispel my ignorance and coarseness."

**Ignorance** means lack of wisdom; **coarseness**, lack of intelligence. Thus, the wondrous practice, with humility and harmony, expounds and clarifies the detailed circumstances of the **Dark Martial**, universally enabling the assembled multitude to hear the numinous causes. It is also hoped that all beings in the three realms and heavens may fully comprehend the profound purport and essential principles of the **Dark Martial’s** wondrous records.

Thereupon, the **Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity** unfolded his dark words, explaining those causes and resolving the supreme matters.

Formerly, in the **Palace of the Desireless Heaven** above the **Great Luo Realm**, there was the **King of Pure Joy**. This king of **Pure Joy** was a sagely and wise ruler who, through his endeavors, conceived the **Dark Emperor**, succeeding his father’s mandate. Ultimately, by virtue of the pure and faithful merit cultivated in previous lives, his destiny transcended the **Palace of the Desireless Heaven**. He clothed and fed himself from the celestial kitchens, receiving all the spontaneous joys of heaven.

The *Scripture of the Void Sovereign*’s *Exalted Scripture of the Dark Mystery, the Great Sage True Martial’s Original Transmission, and the Wondrous Divine Incantations*, Scroll Three, states: "One who performs a thousand good deeds bestows blessings upon seven generations; the deceased soul becomes an immortal. When ten thousand good deeds are complete, a jade tally descends to welcome them, a thousand spirits come to pay homage, and they ascend at dawn."

The **Dark Emperor**, having cultivated the true and achieved results, received the Celestial Edict, which proclaimed: The **Old Heavenly Lord of the Nine-Fives** descended and declared, "Your sagely father and sagely mother are already in the **Nine Empyreans**." The **Nine Empyreans** are the **Jade Purity’s** **Realm of No-Form**, where thirty-six celestial palaces are arrayed, all subordinate to the three realms of the **Great Luo**.

The **Dark Emperor’s** parents came to reside in the **Dragon-Transformed Brahma-Passage Heaven**, within the **Palace of the Desireless**. According to the *Scripture of Purple Radiance*: The kingdom of **Pure Joy** is a land of immortals beyond the seas, located west of the **Yuezhi** country in the Western Regions, beneath the stellar divisions of **Kui** and **Lou**.

The **Virtuous Victorious Queen** dreamed of swallowing the sun and, upon waking, conceived. Her qi did not admit evil; daily she practiced the Way. After fourteen months—over four hundred days—on the third day of the third month in the **Jiawu** year of the **Kaihuang** era, at the hour of **Wu**, he was born in the royal palace. His appearance was extraordinary. After growing up, he renounced his home and bid farewell to his parents.

According to the *Veritable Record of Planchette Descents*: When the **Dark Emperor** was born, it coincided with the **Kaihuang** initial kalpa of heaven, the first year of the **Yellow Emperor’s Purple Cloud** era on earth, in the **Jiawu** year, the third day of the third month, the **Jiayin** day, at the **Gengwu** hour. He embodied the essence of the **Great Yang**, incarnating through conception and emerging from his mother’s left knee.

At his birth, auspicious clouds covered the kingdom, rare fragrances filled the air, and the land transformed into gold and jade. The omens of auspicious responses are too numerous to record. His childhood name was **An Yu**. Born with divine numinosity, his actions were mysterious and manifest. By the age of seven, he had perused all classics and comprehended them silently. Gazing upward and examining below, there was nothing he did not understand. He concealed his heart in the Dao, his aspirations aligned with the **Great Void**, wishing to serve the **Supreme Emperor** and universally bless the people.

His father, the king, did not wish to suppress his aspirations. At fifteen, he bid farewell again, and the king granted his leave, bestowing upon him the Daoist name **Qian Yunzi**. According to the *Veritable Record*: The **Supreme** granted the **Dark Emperor** the surname **Li**, taking it from the source of clan transformation.

According to the *Planchette Descent at the Altar of Mount Heaven in Xizhou, Western Regions*: The sacred father’s jade name is pronounced **Gu Wo**. The **Dark Emperor’s** jade name is **Qi**. According to the *Record of the Awakening of Sagacity*: When the **Dark Emperor** responded to transformation during the Tang, his surname was **Pei**, and his given name was **Zhongfang**. According to the *Scripture of Original Birth*: His grandfather’s name was **Niu Zi**, his clan name was **Duan Shouyou**, and his secret name consisted of four characters: **Ze Xia Yan Cheng**.

In the presence of the sacred seat, one should ensure these jade names are not violated.

Within this scripture, where the two characters *cheng* (乘) appear, they may be silently recited in secret pronunciation to serve as avoidance. When presenting petitions or submitting written prayers to the **Dark Emperor**, one must not inscribe any of the tabooed names within the memorials. For two-character taboos, their combined use is forbidden; if used singly, the character should be written incomplete.

He entered **Mount Wudang** to cultivate the Dao for forty-two years, where his merit was perfected and his fruition fulfilled. Ascending to heaven in broad daylight, the **Jade Emperor** issued a decree, enfeoffing him as **Supreme Mystery**, charged with guarding the northern quarter. Thus began the cause of his manifestation at the frontier.

**Wudang**, in ancient times, was called **Mount Taihe**. According to the *Nine and Five Scripture of Heaven and Earth’s Latitude and Longitude*: After **Yu** had tamed the waters and divided the land into nine provinces, he established the five sacred peaks and defined the boundaries of the four great rivers. In his virtue of sustaining the earth, he entrusted the oversight of all famous mountains and great rivers to divine spirits. Upon examining the region beneath the *Yi* and *Mao* constellations, there was a mountain called **Taihe**. Elders of old transmitted that this was the place where, in high antiquity, **Xuanwu** attained the Dao and ascended in flight. Thus, the name **Taihe** was changed, and it was enfeoffed as **Mount Wudang**.

According to the *Veritable Record*: The prince left the palace and sought out secluded valleys, where he encountered the **Jade Purity Sagely Ancestor, Purple Prime Lady**, who bestowed upon him the **Supreme Dao of the Limitless**. The Lady said: “You may cross the eastern sea and journey to the region beneath the *Yi* and *Jiao* constellations, where a mountain arises from the *Qian* and *Dui* trigrams, winding for fifty thousand *li*, its waters issuing from the *Zhen* palace. Since the time of the **Great Ultimate**, this mountain has existed, corresponding above to the two heavens of **Manifest Stability** and **Ultimate Peace**. You may enter this mountain and dwell among its central peaks, choosing the loftiest, **Purple Empyrean**. When two thousand five hundred years have passed after the **Great Harmony’s** ascension, during the fourth kalpa of the **Dragon Han** era, you shall let down your hair and go barefoot, gathering the true essence of *Kan* and *Li*, returning to the root and restoring your position. Above, you shall become a minister of the **Three Realms**; below, a great sage of the **Ten Directions**. Only then will your name be manifest for a hundred million kalpas, equal in duration to heaven and earth, sun and moon—such is the fulfillment of your fruition.”

Having spoken, the **Purple Prime Lady** ascended upon the clouds and departed. The prince then followed his master’s instructions, crossing the eastern sea, and indeed beheld the mountain of which she had spoken. Its waters were hidden and submerged, with seventy-two peaks, one summit soaring emerald-green, piercing the **Purple Empyrean**. Below, there was a cliff facing the sun, serene and empty. Thus, he heeded his master’s admonition: the mountain was named **Mount Taihe**, the peak **Purple Empyrean Peak**, and the cliff **Purple Empyrean Cliff**. There he divined his dwelling.

Abiding in profound emptiness and mysterious unity, he silently communed with the myriad perfected. For forty-two years, he mastered the **Supreme Dao**. In the fifty-seventh year of the **Yellow Emperor’s Purple Cloud** era, during the *gengyin* year, on the ninth day of the ninth month, the *bingxu* day, at dawn, auspicious clouds and celestial blossoms descended like rain, filling the mountain valleys. For miles around, the forests and peaks resounded with the spontaneous music of immortal hymns. The prince stood with hands clasped upon **Purple Empyrean Peak**. In an instant, the clouds dispersed, revealing five perfected immortals, **Wei Xian**, with an entourage so grand it was beyond the ordinary. All who saw or heard descended and gathered. The prince bowed deeply, reverently welcoming them.

The five perfected said: “We are the **Nine and Five Elder Heavenly Lords**, acting by decree of the **Three Clarities’ Jade Emperor**, to open your path.” At noon, the five perfected proclaimed the decree. The prince bowed twice, kowtowing, then rose to receive the decree and accept the bestowal. After changing his ceremonial robes, he gathered his jade tablet, mounted a flying cloud, and ascended upon a jade chariot with a feather canopy and jeweled wheels, proceeding to pay homage in the **Nine Clarities’ Realm**.

As for the **Jade Emperor’s decree**, it is the celestial seal-script of one hundred sixty-eight characters contained within this scripture. Upon receiving this, he was appointed to the office of **Supreme Mystery**, and only then did his traces become manifest, so that the world might know the cause of his cultivation.

The perfected one bowed deeply and again prostrated himself, addressing the **Purple Tenuity Great Emperor**: “The **Jade Emperor’s** decree of enfeoffment must contain a wondrous intent. I dare ask for its general purport, to enlighten my humble understanding.”

At that time, the **Purple Tenuity Great Emperor** replied to **Miaoxing**: “The celestial scripture is secret and profound; how can it be discussed or proclaimed? To reveal heavenly mysteries would be most improper. The hidden language of the **Great Brahma**—how could it be made known to the multitude? The affairs of the **Purple Tenuity** at the center of the northern pole are to assist the **Golden Watchtower of the August Heaven**, issuing decrees, bestowing praise, and admonishing the eastern regions—this is the extent of the matter. In accordance with the imperial edict of the **Three Clarities’ Jade Emperor**, the decree was issued and its provisions carried out. Once transcribed, it was sealed within the **Purple Palace**. Moreover, the regulations of the **Illustrious Perfected** are not to be lightly transgressed. To recklessly divulge the sacred teachings would risk the fault of careless disclosure.”

At that time, **Miaoxing**, moved by the sincerity of the assembly, inquired of the **Great Emperor’s** intent. With utmost humility and reverence, he specially restrained the multitude, establishing vows and covenants, so that those whose aspirations aligned with the rites might proceed.

**Miaoxing the Perfected One** bowed with hands clasped and kowtowed, then addressed the throne: “Though my karmic affinity is shallow, I trust in the sagely compassion, which bends to consider the multitude of perfected. If I were to lightly disclose or neglect this, I would fall into evil destinies, becoming a **lower ghost** for ten thousand kalpas and a thousand rebirths, forever revolving through the six paths of defilement—all called **evil destinies**, the **dark officials of the nether realms**, collectively known as **lower ghosts**.”

Then the **Purple Tenuity Great Emperor**, moved by this perfected one’s earnest devotion and repeated entreaties, proclaimed the imperial decree to instruct the assembly.

*Bowing with hands clasped* refers to holding a tablet and kneeling in the ritual of opening the altar. *Kowtowing* means bowing the head to the ground in prostration. *Three entreaties* means nine bows with hands clasped, three prostrations, and three risings.

**Miaoxing** earnestly petitioned and then established vows: though his karmic affinity was shallow, he dared not show reverence in word while violating it in heart. Should he transgress, he willingly accepted the fate of becoming a **lower ghost**. Having made three entreaties on behalf of the multitude, he received the **Great Emperor’s** decree. The **Attendant Secretary** was dispatched to open the jade casket with a jade key, revealing the **Dark Emperor’s** decree of ascension to be proclaimed.

This secret script is written in golden seal-script, a square *zhang* in size, called the **Celestial Talisman**. Whoever beholds it shall forever dwell among the **heavenly immortals**; whoever hears it shall not pass through **hell**. What, then, is this secret?

The proclamation from the Golden Gates beneath the Three Heavens of the Radiant Celestial Pole reaffirms the exalted seal of this **Celestial Talisman**. According to the *Veritable Records*, the talismanic script and imperial decree were composed and inscribed by the **Perfected Sovereign of Heaven**. The characters, a square *zhang* in size, are eight-pointed with flying rays, each stroke a *chi* in length. This is the form of the **Crimson Writ of Jade Characters**, its shape wrought in inlaid gold. To dwell forever among the **heavenly immortals** is to ascend to the **Boundless Immortal Courts of this Assembly**, where all may behold it and thereby elevate their rank.

As for those who hear it: during the late Eastern Han, the **Most High** descended to Shu and transmitted the **Mysterious Warrior’s** scripture to the **Perfected Lord Zhang Daoling**, entrusting its dissemination to the world. Lord Zhang then rendered the golden seal-script’s profound meaning into a common written form, benefiting all who study the Dao. Those who recite or hear it preserve the **Great Mystery’s qi** within the **Kidney Palace**, fortifying the gates of the **Ear Residence** with keen hearing. Thus, the **Earth Bureau’s Black Register** cannot record those who have accrued eight hundred merits. When such practitioners reach life’s end, their souls shall not descend into the **earth-prison hells**.

According to the *Collected Works of Celestial Master Du Guangting*: the Dao first spread without beginning, formless amid the Han’s chaos. Qi congealed in the vast expanse, patterns coalesced within the Great Void, their sinuous strokes forming characters with eight-pointed flying rays. The **Primordial Beginning** commanded the **Perfected Sovereign of Heaven** to model and transcribe them, naming them the **Celestial Writ of Jade Seal-Script**—the primordial form of all writing.

Its **Vernal Writ** states:
This scripture’s celestial talisman and decree descend by inspired brush, as recorded in the *Veritable Book*. A missive from the Three Offices beneath the Golden Gates of the Radiant Celestial Pole is hereby issued:

Thus, the **Divine Child Jing Le**, Prince of the Pure Joy Kingdom, at seven years of age, and the **Dao-seeking Youth of the Avoided State**, at fifteen, with both parents—
You, whose transformation arises from the **Primordial Qi of the Great Origin**, whose birth is the **Celestial One’s** honor, the **Supreme Yin’s** singularity, the **Purple Sovereign’s** sacred form—
Though silent, you teach; by guarding the center, you forget words. The **Perfected Lord of Learning** cannot fathom your divinity; none know the **Emperor’s** likeness—only that your **virtue** attains the divine.
Through measureless kalpas, you dissolve the blades of demons, unraveling entanglements. Subtly present, you guard the **primordial qi**, ensuring its eternal endurance.
Empty the heart yet fill the belly; purify the heart and diminish desires. Embrace the One and follow the **Perfected**; harmonize with light and merge with dust. Conceal brilliance and obscure clarity; carve open creation, hollow the self, and refine the essence. Scatter the uncarved block, return to simplicity—lumpish, unhewn.
For six million years, since the **Yan Kang** kalpa’s inception in the *gengyin* year, eighty-two incarnations have passed. The **Five Spirits’** elder first took the **Mysterious Warrior’s** form.
Bending the whole to straighten the crooked, humbling the self to realize the Dao, raising the many to extend the few—like water, you descend to measure all things, renewing the old. You transform decay and innovate.
Nurturing yin to foster yang, yin births yang, the female *gui* and male *ren* revive the dead to become human. Fearing the heavens’ chaos, you safeguard life and preserve the scriptures.
Your merit does not rely on boasting; your beneficence spreads without attachment. Your **virtue** is true, not seeking lofty recognition. True stillness endures in eternal purity.
Now, it is fitting to once more manifest the decree of the **Radiant Celestial Pole**, commanding the **Great Mystery’s** might to eternally guard the **Northern Heavens**. Assume sole governance, pity the people, and punish rebellion. When portents of treachery appear, swiftly capture and annihilate them. Suppress demonic vapors and wayward qi; quell their reckless rampage.
Hold the **Chart and Registers**; grasp the **Cosmic Ultimate Diagram**. Swear oaths to subdue demonic traces; pacify demonic toil with the **Great Punishment’s** expulsion.
The **Imperial Perfected’s** numinous assembly and the **Earthly Perfected’s** governance—your brush is vast, your ministers drive spirits and mount dragons. Commanding dragons and steeds, you lead the **Ten Titled Armies**. The generals of *jia* and *geng* days uphold discipline; their reins are specially granted. By your movement, you achieve success; your arts are lauded, your merits recorded.
Encircling the Six Directions and Twelve Divisions, you patrol by month and day, universally bestowing fortune. Manifesting in myriad forms, you descend to bless heaven and earth.
The Dao parallels heaven and earth; the **Great Dao’s** comparison may be decreed. Ascend in flight—all **Perfected** acclaim it; the **Nine Purities’** myriad **Perfected** ride together to the **Imperial Court**.

**Hereby Appointed:**
**Grand Marshal of the Great Mystery**
**Director of the Bureau of Harmonious Transitions**

**Decree Received. To Be Executed.**

The Purple Tenuity thus spoke to the Perfected, saying: "This document is a secret decree of the Jade Emperor, a solemn proclamation of the Heavenly Thearch—it must not be lightly transmitted, lest one incur punitive censure."

The Three Proclamations treasured by the Great Emperor of Purple Tenuity state:
First: "The celestial writ is arcane; how may it be discussed or disseminated? One fears the leakage of Heaven’s mechanisms."
Second: "The Jade Emperor’s secret decree must not be lightly transmitted, lest one incur punitive censure."
Third: "Unless one is a Perfected of the highest order, secrecy is fitting."

The transmission of these admonitions warns that reverence in speech may yet conceal dissonance in the heart.

The *Scripture of the Green Cause* states: "Those who in this life enjoy longevity, wealth, and nobility have, in past lives, revered and trusted the Great Dao, deriving therefrom its wondrous principles. Those whose families endure unwaning prosperity across kalpas have, in past lives, extended devotion to the Orthodox and Perfected, achieving merit and virtue thereby. Those who in this life possess keen talent, profound insight, and deep comprehension of the subtle principles that illuminate the true nature have, in past lives, upheld sacred scriptures and refrained from reckless transmission."

The Perfected bowed deeply and addressed the Emperor again, saying: "I have heard that the General of the Dark Warrior possesses boundless divine efficacy, yet does not occupy the ranks of the myriad deities but instead guards the northern quadrant. The cause of his wondrous function and the covenant of his numinous brilliance must hold profound significance. I humbly beseech an explanation to dispel my ignorance."

The Perfected of Wondrous Conduct further inquired into the abstruse mysteries of the Dark Warrior, asking why he holds exclusive governance and is stationed in the north.

The Great Emperor’s voice responded to the Perfected, saying: "In the heavens above the north, the host of luminaries pay homage—without the most divine, who could restrain and govern? At the center of the heavens, within the northern pole, stands the imperial court of Purple Tenuity. The Bureau of Harmonious Transitions lies north of the Purple Court, and the Dark Emperor’s august governance ranks to the right of the Four Marshals of the Celestial Offices, guiding the myriad phenomena of the forest of existence. Thus, the scriptures say, 'The host of luminaries pay homage in their duties,' and the Dark Emperor’s achievements and merits are commensurate with this office.

Whenever the assembly of Perfected gathers to pay court to the August Celestial Honored One, the Four Saints serve as the vanguard of the ranks.

The *Veritable Record* states: When the Primordial Ascended within the Jade Clarity Palace and convened the assembly of the Celestial Thearchs of the Myriad Heavens, reviewing and promoting the host of Perfected across the Three Realms and appointing the Nine Heavens’ offices, the Jade Gentleman Attendant of the Celestial Marshal opened the Great Cinnabar Jade Casket and produced the *Jade Chronicle of Merit and Demerit of the Myriad Heavens*. The decree commanded the Golden Watchtower Attendant-in-Chief, the Celestial Marshal Divine Lord Han the Venerable; the Golden Watchtower Director of Destinies, the Perfected Han; the Golden Watchtower Recorder of Names, the Perfected of the Jade Chronicle of Destinies; the Golden Pass Director of Merit, the Nine Heavens’ Investigator Perfected Lord; and the Golden Watchtower Director of Demerit, the Nine Heavens’ Treasurer of Blessings Perfected Lord—all to open the chronicle and examine the merits of the Three Officials and the Four Saints. Since the opening of the Great Void and the emergence of the Divine Unity, he has borne the merit of protecting Heaven and aiding Earth in nurturing transformation. His achievements were memorialized to the Three Clarities, whereupon the Jade Emperor personally conducted the ritual, bestowing the title of 'Perfected Subordinate to the Emperor.' Thereupon, the Dark Warrior was summoned to the court, ascending the Seven-Treasured Jade Terrace. The Golden Watchtower Attendant-in-Chief, the Grand Academician of the Hall of Primordial Numinosity, the Direct Servitor of the Three Heavenly Gates, the Custodian of the Treasury of Numinosity, the Memorialist, the Golden Perfected, the Purple Yang Grand Master, the Radiant and Virtuous Transcendent Lord Xuanyuan, who holds the register, was dispatched to the Three Heavenly Gates of the August Ultimate. The jade tablet conveyed the mandate, and the office was granted: the Dark Warrior was invested with the Heaven-Connecting Twelve-Tiered Cap, the dark ceremonial robe adorned with the sun, moon, mountains, dragons, and cosmic imagery, the dark jade ritual tablet, the red-soled dark shoes, the jasper banner and precious staff, the Nine-Dragon Jade Brush. The Dark Warrior bowed to receive them and completed his change of attire.

Thereafter, the Transcendent Lord reverently recited the Threefold Edict of the Jade Clarity Palace, saying: "The august Great Dao, the majestic Supreme Perfected, at the division of the Great Ultimate, gave birth to the transformations of the Primordial Mystery. Its wondrous pivot encompasses the mechanisms of the myriad heavens, and all honor the Celestial Honored One as the sagely and luminous sovereign of their affairs. How vast and exalted are his blessings—how dare we not revere them?"

With reverence, we consider the Great Primordial Master, the Great General of the Dark Warrior of the Great Mystery, the Commander-in-Chief of the Three Origins, the Marshal of the Nine Heavens’ Patrols, the Right Celestial Pivot of the Northern Pole’s Right Wall, the Grand Commander of the Three Realms—continuing in his former office as Director of the Bureau of Harmonious Transitions and Adjudicator of the Right Victory Office of the Mysterious Capital.

The Register of the Supreme Purple Emperor and the Perfected of Heavenly Unity states: "His numinosity penetrates the supremely wondrous, opening the mysteries of primordial transformation. His Dao is replete and resplendent, governing the essence of the Void and Danger constellations. He nurtures the primordial of Heaven and completes the records of Earth. He upholds the transformations of the four seasons and extends the disciplines of the eight nodes. Manifesting in myriad forms, he universally blesses Heaven and Earth. His merit equals that of fifty million kalpas; his virtue parallels the thirty-two heavens and nine auroras. Above, he relies on the true majesty of the Ten Poles; below, he depends on the vast transformations of the divine. He bestows benefits upon the people and accumulates sagely virtue throughout the Jade Chronicle. In accordance with the registers and talismans, he is deemed a Perfected Subordinate to the Emperor—how dare we not honor him?"

To manifest his virtue, he was specially appointed as the Jade Void Preceptor and Minister, the Dark Celestial Thearch, and Marshal of the Nine Heavens’ Investigators.

The golden script of the register states: "The Dao gives birth to the One qi, which transforms the Three Powers. It crystallizes the true within the splendor of the Nine Poles and dawns radiantly in the excellence of the Six Heavens. Subtle and resplendent, profound and luminous, its merit is boundless—it is fitting to bestow honor. We hope you will not decline out of modesty. I shall henceforth assist the Great Dao, enduring across kalpas, and protect the myriad people, extending blessings eternally."

The dragon script descended in illumination, to be forever concealed in the Mysterious Capital.

With reverence, we proclaim the ennoblement: His Sagely Father is the Heavenly Lord of Pure Joy, the Radiant and Perfected Great Emperor; his Sagely Mother is the Queen Mother of Victorious Goodness, the Jasper Perfected Transcendent. Below, they shade the Celestial Pass: the General of the Fire Essence Containing Yin, the Venerable Dark Spirit of Vermilion Numinosity; and the General of the Water Essence Nurturing Yang, the Venerable Dark Spirit of Black Numinosity—both reside in the Palace of True Felicity of Heavenly Unity.

Gazing upon the Dark Emperor’s achievements and merits, we see that his authority today encompasses the governance of merit and demerit across the Three Realms. The circumstances of his true blessings still rely on his majestic assistance, for his divine efficacy is indeed boundless.

The Perfected then inquired of the Purple Tenuity: "If there are those among the celestial and human realms who, with sincere devotion, revere and honor him, will they obtain blessings and benefits?"

The Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, contemplating the myriad phenomena and aligning with the hearts of Heaven and humanity, further inquired about the blessings of reverence and how they might transform the destinies of humans and gods.

The Great Emperor replied: "This divine general, on the sixth, sixteenth, and twenty-sixth days of every month, when the various heavens conduct their investigations..."

These various heavens govern the public affairs of the Realm of Form and Desire. The guardianship of the Dark Emperor involves patrolling and inspecting the Two Luminaries, the Three Celestial Bodies, the Five Phases, the myriad phenomena, and the affairs of the stellar palaces, suppressing and pacifying unruly comets and malevolent stars. Thus, the original scripture states: "Thrice each month, he leads the divine troops in person to the various heavens to conduct thorough inspections. Whenever encountering perverse qi or malevolent stars, he swiftly executes and destroys them—such is his duty."

The heavens of the Realm of Form belong to the Three Qi Lords of the Upper Primordial. They summon the celestial beings of the spring retinue, along with the eighteen Heavenly Lords governing the inner and outer realms, whose august titles are reverently recorded as follows: the Nine Heavens of the Five Qi Heavenly Lord, governing the North; the Primordial Numinous Supreme Heaven’s Beginning Plain Heavenly Lord, governing the Southwest; the Wondrous Numinous Treasure Flower Heaven’s Nine Qi Heavenly Lord, governing the East; the Jade Flower Boundless Heaven’s Beginning Cinnabar Heavenly Lord, governing the Southeast; the Great Void True Ultimate Heaven’s One Qi Heavenly Lord, governing the Upper Realm; the Jade Pure Void Emperor Heaven’s Beginning Mysterious Heavenly Lord, governing the Northwest; the Plain Numinous Radiant Origin Heaven’s Seven Black Heavenly Lord, governing the West; the Jade Numinous Plain Flower Heaven’s Beginning Azure Heavenly Lord, governing the Northeast; the Supreme Numinous True Origin Heaven’s Three Qi Heavenly Lord, governing the South; the Southern Culmen Jade Script Heaven’s Outer Nine Heavens Wisdom Virtue Heavenly Venerable, governing the North; the Twin Gates Transformation Body Heaven’s Majestic Model Heavenly Venerable, governing the Southwest; the Utmost Wondrous Transformative Void Heaven’s Benevolent Love Heavenly Venerable, governing the East; the Primordial True Treasure Radiance Heaven’s Compassionate Harmony Heavenly Venerable, governing the Southeast; the Opening Numinous Transmitting Dao Heaven’s Bearing Virtue Heavenly Venerable, governing the Lower Realm; the Central Culmen Total Life Heaven’s Accomplished Transformation Heavenly Venerable, governing the Northwest; the Primordial Pass Universal Salvation Heaven’s Righteous Deliberation Heavenly Venerable, governing the West; the Accomplished Virtue Radiant Crystal Heaven’s Wisdom Accumulation Heavenly Venerable, governing the Northeast; and the Radiant Flowing Light Heaven’s Ritual Teaching Heavenly Venerable, governing the South.

The Heaven of Transformative Peace in the Realm of Form is a place beyond the Five Phases, where the celestial beings of the spring retinue are clothed and fed from the celestial pantries. This originates from the fact that all practitioners of cultivation may attain it. The *Commentary on the Numinous Treasure Scriptures* states: "A person who performs a hundred good deeds has their name recorded by the Eastern Flower [Realm]; upon completing three hundred good deeds, they transcend the karma of bodily actions. With pure conduct at life’s end, their spirit ascends according to their merits, soaring to this realm like a flying bird. Those who further cultivate and achieve a thousand good deeds extend blessings to seven generations of ancestors, whose spiritual souls and essences gather to form the spring retinue."

The heavens of the Realm of Desire belong to the Three Qi Lords of the Middle Primordial, who summon the celestial spring retinues. These six heavens and ten realms occupy the lowest positions, bordering the crowns of the human world, and their names are listed below. The titles and domains of the various heavens are as follows: the Victorious Goodness Heavenly King, governing the Northern Realm; the Wondrous Transformation Heavenly King of the Heaven of Self-Transformation, governing the Eastern Realm; the Wondrous Virtue Heavenly King of the Heaven of Joyful Transformation, governing the Central Realm; the Pure and Serene Heavenly King of the Tuṣita Heaven, governing the Southern Realm; the Numinous Harmony Heavenly King of the Yama Heaven, governing the Western Realm; and the Pure Harmony Heavenly King of the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, along with the Four Heavenly Kings guarding the Central Realm—the Eastern Realm’s Guardian, the Heavenly King of the State; the Southern Realm’s Guardian, the Heavenly King of Growth; the Western Realm’s Guardian, the Heavenly King of Vast Sun; and the Northern Realm’s Guardian, the Heavenly King of Many Hearings.

The *Numinous Treasure Scriptures* state: "A person who performs ten good deeds has their lifespan recorded by the Controller of Destiny; upon completing fifty good deeds, they are befriended by the Five Emperors. Gradually, the three karmic actions are purified, and body and spirit begin to forget their burdens. They attain the wonders of the Five Phases, and at the end of their heavenly mandate, their spiritual soul directly ascends to these heavenly realms to enjoy great bliss." Moreover, the Dark Emperor, by his ordained duty, perpetually nurtures the Primordial of Heaven.

**The Ten Patrolling Journeys**
The Ten Journeys refer to the Ten Great Grotto-Heavens. Patrolling and inspecting them is the public duty of the immortals. According to the *Repentance Before Heaven*, each grotto-heaven establishes its own immortal officials and bureaus to collectively manage the registers of the myriad beings, recording merits and demerits. On the seventh day of the first month, the eighth day of the second month, the ninth day of the third month, the fourth day of the fourth month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the seventh day of the sixth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, the thirteenth day of the eighth month, the ninth day of the ninth month, the twenty-first day of the tenth month, the seventh day of the eleventh month, and the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month, they descend to the human world to eradicate demonic forces, expel pestilence, protect human well-being and longevity, and fulfill the mandate of Heaven. Those whose qi is upright and whose hearts are pure, who are wholly loyal and perfectly filial, have their names inscribed on jade tablets and are recommended for ascension as immortals. There are further profound regulations, too numerous to recount.

The Perfected bowed again and inquired of the Purple Tenuity Great Emperor: "We have heard the causes of manifest transformation, and the reverence of celestial and human beings. But how should the General of the Dark Warrior be venerated, and what expedient means should be employed to obtain blessings and benefits? We humbly request your instruction."

The Wondrous Conduct Perfected asked about the offerings and rites for those who take refuge.

At that time, the Great Emperor addressed the Perfected, saying: "Within Heaven and Earth, those who wholeheartedly revere and honor the Dark Warrior, throughout their lives abstaining from the flesh of scaled fish, the stench of raw meat, self-slaughtered or poisoned creatures, and foul impurities, as well as from scallions, garlic, and leeks; who refrain from indulging in lust and desire, and avoid contact with corpses and childbirth—if they can sever these attachments, they may then devote themselves sincerely. On every day of his descent, they will receive auspicious blessings."

The Great Emperor spoke of "within Heaven and Earth" to refer to all people in the great thousand-world realm. Those who wholeheartedly venerate the Dark Warrior, maintaining incense and offerings with sincerity and reverence, and adhering to the prohibitions of this scripture, truly benefit their well-being. As the *Scripture of Responding to the Mandate* states: "Eat and drink according to circumstances, without straining the spirit or fixating on appearances. Drink to nourish the blood and flesh of the physical body, and eat to replenish the qi of the viscera." According to the *Numinous Treasure Great Precepts Scripture*: "The primordial spirit within the body must be kept pure and undefiled. Do not consume foul and rank foods, for they obstruct the channels of the meridians and entangle the six viscera. Moreover, fatty meats and pungent spices cloud the gates of the spirit, steam the five viscera, and generate manifold illnesses and afflictions."

How can one hope for longevity without understanding the relationship between form and spirit? This scripture preserves the celestial years of humanity and dispels calamities and afflictions. These are the essential methods to be observed and guarded.

Foul and rank foods include the flesh of soft-shelled turtles, alligators, tortoises, turtles, snakes, eels, and black carp. The meat of oxen, horses, and wild beasts is termed "rank." Additionally, one must avoid animals that have died of themselves or been poisoned. "Died of themselves" refers to creatures that perish without cause while still alive. "Poisoned" denotes remnants left by fierce beasts after seizing and devouring their prey. Consuming such self-dead or maimed creatures shortens one’s lifespan—this is the principle.

According to *Sun the Perfected One’s Dietary Prohibitions*: "Defiled substances include horse meat, which is impure, and dog meat, which is filthy. *Licai* is wild garlic, and excessive consumption dissipates the spirit. Though garlic may be used medicinally, prolonged intake obstructs the spirit’s qi. Coriander’s pungent odor penetrates the flesh and causes forgetfulness. Mustard greens, leeks, and *peng* are all classified as pungent vegetables."

Indulgence in lust depletes essence and harms the kidneys, causing the Dark Warrior to depart. Excessive desire scatters qi and dissipates spirit, prompting the Vermilion Bird to abandon one. Those who handle corpses invite dead spirits to haunt and startle the soul, driving the Azure Dragon away. Attending childbirth exposes one to blood’s foulness, which assaults the po, causing the White Tiger to flee. Should one inadvertently consume forbidden foods, recite the scripture’s purificatory incantation for the body, and the impure qi will be expelled from within.

Only when assisting with the corpses of parents or teachers may one wait until after burial, don fresh garments, and then approach the sacred to pay homage to the immortals. As the *Appended Judgments to the Book of Changes* states: "What Heaven aids is compliance; what humanity reveres is sincerity." Sincerity is wholehearted devotion—offering incense morning and evening, knocking at the Jade Void’s gate, and with earnest intent, beseeching the Supreme Mystery Perfected One. Follow the records of good deeds in the *Salted Departments*, and submit them to the Right Victory Prefecture. Auspicious blessings will surely descend, illuminating your household. Progress gradually, and Heaven will protect you. The night before the sacred descent is the appointed time.

First, purify body and mind, allowing no turbid thoughts to disturb them. "First purify" means to cleanse bodily filth in advance. Confucius said: "Bathing is for ritual purity, not for adornment." "Allowing no turbid thoughts" means to dispel the chaos within one’s breast. The Most High said: "When the mind is settled, the spirit naturally becomes clear." He also said: "When form and spirit are both wondrous, they unite with the Dao in truth."

By the fifth watch, personally prepare incense and candles, pure fruits, and jujube broth. The incense conveys sincerity to the perfected; only aloeswood incense will do. Yellow wax candles are prized for their luminous brightness in sacrifice. Pure fruits are the five fruits, with pomegranates and plums forbidden. Jujube broth is made from jujubes dried in boiling water and sun-steeped. The *Inner Transmission of Yin Xi* states: "Immortals often entertain guests with jujubes."

Pure water is also excellent. The offering of pure water stems from the Tang dynasty’s posthumous enfeoffment of the Most High Lord Lao as Ancestor. When Emperor Xianzong visited Guangping Park, he sat in a pavilion at night and beheld the Perfected Warrior descending in majestic form, standing amidst the clouds. The emperor burned incense and personally inquired about the celestial court’s ritual protocols. The Perfected Warrior replied: "Medicinal incense can convey sincerity; without incense, sincerity cannot reach the vault of heaven. Pouring water can cleanse impure *qi*; all purity arises from this, so offerings must include water." After speaking, the emperor expressed his gratitude, and the Perfected Warrior ascended to heaven. This occurred on the night of the eighth day of the eighth month in the first year of the Yuanhe era, within the Tang palace.

Beholding this, how could the desires of the Supreme Sages be otherwise? We must express our sincerity and adhere to this. There are three ranks in the array, yet the will must remain pure and undivided.

The three ranks in the array are as follows: On the third day of the third month each year, the Dark Emperor feasts with the Divine Father and Divine Mother in the Jade Pool Grotto-Heaven of the Jasper Lake, in gratitude for the day of his birth. One incense burner, two candles, and pure offerings of jujube soup shall be arranged, dividing the setting into three positions.

As for maintaining pure and undivided will, on all other days of descent, only one position is required for incense, candles, fruit, and soup. Bowing in reverence and making supplications, no wish shall go unanswered. For all who pray with upright sincerity, the Supreme Sages shall grant every request.

The *Record of the Awakening of the Sage* states: During the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song, troubled by misfortune, he summoned the Daoist Master Wang Bochu of the Cavern Spirit lineage to divine auspices in the palace. On the day of the altar rite, the emperor burned a sealed prayer written in his own hand, prostrated himself, and sent forth his spirit to present the memorial to the celestial vault. The following day, Master Bochu reported: "Yesterday, as I ascended to the Supreme Heaven to present the petition, upon returning from court and reaching the Western Gate of Heaven, General Ge announced that the Perfected Warrior had already secured the emperor’s favor. By the Jade Emperor’s imperial brush, an edict was granted, extending the emperor’s lifespan by one *ji*." Delighted, the emperor bestowed an imperial seal and conferred a title upon the Perfected Warrior. In the second year of the Jiayou era, on the first day of the first month, it was decreed that the Hall of Eternal Life in the Mysterious Capital of the Precious Response Pavilion be established along the imperial avenue.

This is respectfully recorded hereafter.

*Hymn of Descent of the Perfected* says:
Ancestor of all things,
Great virtue entrusted,
Essence pervades the Dark Heaven,
Spiritual radiance sublime.
Founder of prosperity,
Guardian of grand harmony,
With incense and reverence,
Five blessings follow.

*Imperial Edict*:
We humbly acknowledge the numinous heavens,
Solemnly descending in rectitude.
The mortal realm illumined,
Protecting the state and quelling disorder.
The peerless Sage manifests,
Responding to devotion,
Bestowing grace and saving the people.
In perfect clarity, all prayers are answered,
Every wish fulfilled,
All petitions confirmed in sincerity.
Not only kings, ministers, Daoists, monks, scholars, and commoners—
All sentient beings who reverently tend the incense fire
Shall see their intentions realized.
Thus, by this merit, goodness abides in the world,
Devoted to aiding others.
Those who receive this grace shall prosper beyond measure.
Now, having received the Sage’s protection,
For nation and family alike,
How could we dare forget the Great Dao?
Prolonging blessings and increasing years,
We forever pray for the safeguarding of the throne.

Having already bestowed grace upon the realm, one hundred and four memorials of *Awakening the Sage* were presented, all of which have fulfilled their transformative purpose. Respectfully, within the Jade Ford Garden, a sacred hall was established to repay the celestial oversight. Having received the manifestation of divine presence, the Perfected Warrior was further granted the status of a guardian deity of the state and household. In reverence for the Supreme Sage, the Perfected Warrior, it is fitting to confer the title: *Grand Marshal of the Three Primordials of Highest Clarity, Commander of the Nine Heavens’ Patrol, Great General of the Left Celestial Array of the Northern Culmen’s Right Wall, True Lord of the Dark Heaven’s Numinous Response, Venerable of the Primordial Transformation, Serene Illumination, Perfect Clarity, Majestic Treasure, Pure and Equal to Heaven, Protector of the State and Pacifier of the People, Longevity-Responding Blessing Deity, Wise and Virtuous, Filial and Sagely, Civil and Martial, Queller of Disorder, Sagely and Merciful Heavenly Marquis*.

By imperial decree, the turtle and serpent are to be enfeoffed and the rites carried out accordingly. The streets of the Two Sages, the Turtle and Serpent, are recorded in the opening lines of this scripture, beneath the passage on the pine demon’s subdued poison.

Thus, one must meditate in stillness with utmost sincerity and recite the divine incantation. "Thus" (*ran*) refers to the Dao’s guidance. "Still meditation" means sitting in a tranquil chamber. "Utmost" (*qian*) denotes profound sincerity. "Faithful recitation" means to intone with devotion.

This deity is numinous and luminous. Striking the teeth and reciting the incantation—incantation being the means by which sound is emitted to repel evil.

The *Scripture of the Void Sovereign* states: "When the body’s filth is unclean, it is washed with worldly water. When the heart’s filth is unclean, it is washed with the Dharma’s words, or by confessing one’s sins, which is also a form of self-purification."

In the northern Dark Heavens, the profound and boundless Divine Lord, the True and Numinous of the Dark Warrior, undergoes myriad transformations. Ascending the heavens and overturning the earth, he drives thunder and races through clouds, his retinue of a thousand myriad banners sweeping away demonic miasmas. Thunder Lords attend him as retainers, Jade Maidens serve as generals. Ghosts and spirits submit, dragons and tigers flee in concealment. His might stabilizes the Five Peaks, and the ten thousand spirits obey. With clanging bells and resounding drums, he traverses the cosmos, capturing rebellious ghosts, crushing and severing demonic grasses. Expelling evil and aiding the upright, the Dao’s qi ever arrives.

*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances of the Primordial Celestial Sovereign!*

According to the *Scripture of Purple Radiance*: This divine incantation originates from the secret writings of the Divine Treasure Lord. Born of the Great Yin, essence of the Water trigram, it corresponds above to the Void and Danger constellations, its form uniting turtle and serpent. Roaming the ninefold earth, it governs and commands the myriad spirits. No darkness escapes its scrutiny, no desire remains unfulfilled. At the end and beginning of kalpas, it severs and subdues demonic essences, rescuing and protecting all beings, bringing peace to households and nations alike.

When the cyclical number reaches the final *jia*, demonic qi spreads. The Celestial Sovereign issues his decree, and thus I descend in numinous manifestation. Concealing and revealing the true teaching, sweeping away evil and averting warfare, transforming and harmonizing the multitudes, aiding the resurgence of the central reign.

Should any petty ghost dare appear, my single gaze will topple the Five Peaks.

*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances of the Great Mystery!*

As recorded in the ninth section of the ninth rank of the *Three Caverns Great Rites* in the *Chapter on Practicing the Dao*: "Divine incantations, most excellent of all, drive away epidemics, sweep away demonic miasmas, and repel malevolent spirits."

Thus concludes the third scroll of the *Wondrous Scripture of the Divine Incantation of the Great Sage of the Dark Heavens, the Perfected Warrior, as Spoken by the Most High*.

Here begins the fourth scroll of the *Wondrous Scripture of the Divine Incantation of the Great Sage of the Dark Heavens, the Perfected Warrior, as Spoken by the Most High*.

Here begins the *Inner Teachings of Ascending the Dao: A Record Compiled by Chen Yin with Annotations*, as transmitted by the Wondrous Practitioner of the True Way:

The Wondrous Practitioner of the True Way declared: "The marvel of virtue and power, the cause of manifest responses—I have been fortunate to hear of these in secret, and in an instant, my delusion was dispelled. Though my ears have heard, there remain those of barbarian tribes and foolish, dull-witted folk who, though their ears may hear of virtue, hold no faith in their hearts. If there are indeed karmic retributions, let a single word be shown to them."

The Perfected One, having already attained and inquired into the cultivation of the Dark Warrior’s bodily practices, whose virtue and conduct are luminously wondrous, whose numinous responses and transformations follow causes to their fruition—all beings, all people, take refuge in him.

Yet again, he posed a question: "As for the foolish and dull-witted, the coarse and ignorant, the barbarian tribes, the stubborn and unenlightened—who among them reveres Heaven and Earth? Who believes in the divine Perfected? Yet each shall receive retribution according to their due. What, then, shall be the fate of those who do not believe in the August Dark Warrior?"

The Supreme Emperor of the Purple Tenuity replied:
"Though they be foolish and dull-witted, they must know heat and cold. Though they dwell among barbarians, they must understand suffering and joy."

The Great Emperor swiftly resolved the Wondrous Practitioner’s doubt, saying: "Heat and cold, suffering and joy—who does not know these?"

Thus, in an age of adversity, the Most High first dispatched Lord Lao of the Hu, together with the stellar lodges Horn, Neck, Root, Chamber, Heart, Tail, and Winnowing Basket, to transform the Nine Yi tribes of the East. Lord Lao of the Qiang, together with Dipper, Ox, Girl, Void, Danger, House, and Wall, to transform the Five Di tribes of the North. Lord Lao of the Di, together with Straddler, Bond, Stomach, Pleiades, Net, Turtle Beak, and Orion, to transform the Six Rong tribes of the West. Lord Lao of the Yue, together with Well, Ghost, Willow, Star, Spread, and Wing, to transform the Eight Man tribes of the South. Lord Lao of the Cang, together with [the remaining lodges], to transform the Central Plains of the Middle Kingdom.

As the *Record of Rites* states: "The peoples of the five directions, though their speech and silence differ, their desires and tastes diverge, each has their settled dwelling, harmonious flavors, suitable garments, and useful implements." Since they are the most spirited among all beings, how could they fail to know suffering and joy, heat and cold? Those who reach this realm must earnestly give thanks to the Supreme Perfected. Those who receive grace—how could they forget to offer sacrifices?

To believe is to have a spirit and soul that are pure and bright. To believe is to sincerely practice the laws of the Five Constants. Naturally, the spirit’s heart becomes pure, and the soul’s intent becomes clear and luminous.

The Primordial Lady declared: "A person who performs a single good deed finds their heart settled and their body at peace."

The Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Void proclaimed: "A person who performs a single good deed brings peace to a hundred spirits." How much more so for one who accumulates thousands or tens of thousands of good deeds—they shall surely ascend to the Great Dao!

To transgress, however, is to invite calamity and misfortune in abundance. To transgress is to act against righteousness, to move contrary to principle. When evil ripens to its appointed time, calamities and misfortunes coil and entwine, repeatedly striking like a relentless storm.

The Great Emperor, in his boundless compassion, briefly admonishes through these eight retributions. In the world, those who diligently honor the Dark Emperor with incense and offerings find their misfortunes scattering like lightning, while blessings arise like clouds. Thus, even the poor and childless among descendants may attain the five human felicities: first, longevity; second, wealth. To dwell in wealth is felicity indeed. Yet those without descendants incur, as Mencius deemed, the fault of unfiliality. In ancient times, the man of Hua offered a blessing, saying: "May Emperor Yao enjoy long life, wealth, and many sons." Yao declined the blessing, for to raise unworthy sons is as good as having none—his position was no different from Shun’s son-in-law. His son, too, acted likewise, abdicating the throne to Minister Yu. Yangzi said: "The young of the mud-dauber dies and meets the potter wasp, who prays, 'Be like me, be like me!' Over time, it comes to resemble it." How swiftly did the seventy disciples come to resemble Confucius! Moreover, comparing the affairs of Yao and Shun suffices to show that the matters of descendants are subject to the Mandate of the Supreme Emperor.

The Primordial Lady declared: "A person who accumulates fifty good deeds in past lives shall see their descendants flourish in this world. One who establishes nine hundred good deeds shall give rise to sages and worthies in their lineage." The *Scripture of Responding to the Times* states: "When the Great Dao was first divided, in the West arose the Buddha, named *Namo* the Realm of Constantly Observing Self-Existence. He established the Universal Gate Vow, responding to the prayers of all. Should people of later generations make offerings and pay homage, seeking sons, sons shall be born; seeking daughters, daughters shall be born." How much more so for the Dark Emperor and the Three Mao Perfected Lords, who likewise fulfill the wishes of the people? Have they not heard of the affairs of Wang Zhi and Zhu Mu?

According to the *Records of the Awakening of the Sage*: During the Huangyou era, Wang Zhi, the Prefectural Inspector of Jizhou and Palace Attendant, had a wife, Lady Jiao of Shouchang Commandery. One day, she saw a withered branch of a pomegranate tree in the rear garden suddenly emit smoke. She poured water upon it, and a halo formed, revealing the True Warrior. Lady Jiao bowed and knocked her head in reverence. Though but a humble mortal, she was fortunate to encounter the descent of a Supreme Perfected One, who came to deliver her child. She had heard that to remain childless all her life was a grave karmic misfortune. The True Warrior promptly descended with a merciful decree, saying: "Your sincerity has moved me to fulfill your wish. Await the third day of the third month next year at Zhen Guan Temple, where I shall grant you a son." Lady Jiao bowed in gratitude, and the sacred trace vanished. She returned and informed her husband. When the appointed day arrived, the couple went together to the temple. Amidst the throng, they burned incense when suddenly a boy of six or seven, claiming to have no parents, seized Wang Zhi and Lady Jiao by the hands. Wang took him home to raise, and the child was naturally bright and clever. Later, he presented himself before the emperor to petition for grace. Emperor Renzong summoned him and, learning that Wang had no heir, Wang recounted the entire affair. The emperor bestowed upon the boy the name Wang Yuan and betrothed him to the Princess of Yue. Wang Yuan passed the military examinations, was enfeoffed as a Duke Consort, and granted a mansion.

Again, in the *Records of the Awakening of the Sage*: Zhu Mu of Leping County in Raozhou served with impartiality in office and conducted himself with humility in his village. Throughout his life, he reverently maintained the incense and offerings to the True Warrior. Yet he lamented his lack of a son. On the seventh night of the seventh month, his wife said: "I just dreamed of a Daoist who drew a plate from his sleeve, bearing a single jujube. He fed it to me, saying, 'This is a divine jujube bestowed by Heaven.' He bade me swallow it, and its fragrance permeated my body." Zhu Mu smelled an extraordinary fragrance filling the room. The following year, she gave birth to a son, whom they named Tianxi. At five, he was already memorizing texts with intelligence; by seven, his name resounded throughout the land. Emperor Shenzong summoned him to court, where he was tested on the classics, histories, and the works of the Hundred Schools, reciting without error. He also responded swiftly to the emperor’s poetic prompts. Pleased, the emperor bestowed upon him the title Gentleman for Fulfilling Service and granted him gold and silk for purchasing books. The Three Departments examined Zhu Mu’s divine prodigy and declared him an auspicious omen for the state.

The Han Chancellor Chen Ping once said: "I have employed many secret strategies, which the Daoists forbid. My lineage shall surely decline." He knew that his attainment of wealth and nobility would leave him without descendants. According to the *Chapter on Protecting Descendants*: "For those whose lineage is in decline, one should redeem their fate by releasing living beings to resolve it." Yet the poor often have many children. Yuan Xian said: "I have heard that to lack wealth is called poverty." Confucius said: "To be poor yet without resentment—such were Yan and Zeng." Yet Yan Hui, second only to the sages in wisdom, and Zeng Shen, a great worthy, still suffered the retribution of bodily poverty. How much more so for those who flatter and deceive! To be poor yet have many children is a karmic transgression from past lives.

The *Celestial Scripture of Penetrating Chapters* states: "Those born into hardship, with no one to rely upon, who encounter enemies and suffer the company of many relatives, living in daily anxiety and shared poverty, enduring cold and hunger—such trials are difficult to resolve at once. Yet if one quiets evil thoughts and does not harbor resentment, this is called inner harmony, and one may swiftly escape the encircling nets of retribution. But if envy and malice persist, one shall fall into evil destinies."

The *Record of Zhao Qi’s Dream* recounts: One night, he dreamed that the former husband of his late wife, the Gentleman of the Palace and Outer Bureau Li Shu, came to his home and bowed, seeking an audience. He said: "The netherworld has now fixed the day of my sentencing. I am to be reborn as a girl in the poor household of the Liu family in the Seventh Emperor’s Ward. I have heard that this family, burdened by poverty and many children, intends to kill her. I shall scarcely regain a human form." He repeated this thrice, saying, "How grievous!"

Having expressed his gratitude, he wiped his tears and departed weeping. Zhao Qi awoke and recounted the dream to his wife, Lady Fan, who confirmed she had dreamed the same. At dawn, he hastened to the Liu household and found they had indeed given birth to a girl, whom they were about to drown in the water—her life hanging by a thread. Zhao Qi bestowed gold upon them, rescuing Li Shu from the brink of drowning.

Generally, poverty and wealth alternate like shadows, and the transformations of Heaven’s principle defy prediction. Observe but a single village: within a decade, fortunes reverse, families wax and wane, and who can claim constancy in gathering or scattering? Thus, those of discernment often find contentment in poverty, awaiting the completion of creation’s design by the Upright Lord.

According to the *Records of Manifesting Sageliness*: In Xuancheng there lived an idle man named Tang Tan, blessed with many children yet content in poverty, fulfilling his allotted fate. His youngest son, Tang Xian, had inherited the ancestral hall’s worship of Zhenwu, the Perfected Warrior, and never once neglected the incense offerings. One day, after winter snow had cleared, a distressed traveler arrived bearing a seated bronze statue of Zhenwu, seeking to sell it to Xian. Xian redeemed it at the offered price, brought it home, and cleansed it with fragrant water. As the grime washed away, the statue revealed itself as pure gold, weighing over fifty taels. Mindful of the price’s inadequacy, Xian, in a daze of devotion, presented it to the authorities. The prefecture, then preparing tribute of money and silk for the imperial court, submitted the statue along with an account of its provenance. The imperial court, upon reviewing the memorial, decreed that the golden statue of Zhenwu, upon entering the inner palace, had radiated a brilliant and auspicious light. Thus, Xuan Prefecture was ordered to disburse five hundred strings of cash from the provincial treasury to Tang Xian as compensation for the gold. Xian accepted the sum and distributed it equally among his brothers, nephews, and sons—Zhongyu, Yuan, and others—each of whom soon established prosperous households. Xian, setting aside his own share, rebuilt the Hall of the Supreme Ultimate at the Taiyi Abbey in gratitude for Zhenwu’s protection and blessings.

Generally, those in straitened circumstances endure their lot, receiving the retribution of this present life. Yet even the coldest valley will know the arrival of spring’s breath. Some men perish in war: if a man holds his rightful place, remains loyal and upright, and dies in fulfillment of the Way, this is a proper end. But those who abandon loyalty to indulge in reckless folly shall surely meet their death amid weapons and severed heads—this is no proper end.

The *Rites of Heavenly Offices* states: "Fine weapons and implements await the state’s great use." Thus, arms are but tools wielded by men. As the *Historical Regulations* verse declares: "Weapons are what the sage employs to punish the violent and pacify a disordered age. Yet when foreign tribes invade the borders or rebels rise within, war becomes inevitable." Heaven is impartial, aiding only those who possess virtue.

Laozi said: "Those who delight in killing cannot achieve their will under Heaven." Have you not heard of the cases of Wang Xian and Chen Chou? The minister Wang Xian, during the early Chunhua era, was sent as an imperial commissioner to govern Dingzhou. One day, a Daoist in tattered robes and a broken cap, his beard bristling like a boar’s, his mouth stretching to his ears, arrived at the official hall to request an audience. He announced: "I oversee affairs at the Fengdu Abbey. Yesterday, I received an edict from the Highest Emperor, ordering the delivery of twenty thousand wandering souls. I have yet to record them in the register of the dead. Whether they live or die now rests with you. If you choose to kill them, though your fame and merit will resound in the celestial bureaus, your own lifespan will be shortened by a decade." Wang dismissed him as a madman, refused to listen, and angrily drove him away.

Soon after, Khitan forces invaded the borderlands, and the Liangmen Fortress stood besieged for many days. As snow fell and the enemy troops grew weary, Wang seized the moment of their unpreparedness and launched a night attack, capturing and routing them. The next day, he executed the prisoners beside the mound of skulls, tallying twenty thousand heads. Only then did Wang regret his decision, but the deed could not be undone. When he reported the victory to the court, he was richly rewarded and promoted to the post of Minister of War. Yet within ten days, he suddenly died.

*The Record of Divine Manifestations* states:

During the Song dynasty, Minister of Revenue Chen Chou was appointed to Yue Prefecture when he suddenly received an imperial summons to return to the capital—a matter that aroused considerable suspicion. Chen personally visited the Qianming Abbey, ascended the Hall of Zhenwu, and burned incense to divine by lot. He drew the fourth slip from the Yellow True Lord, its words refined and elegant. He then sought the interpretation of Yang Fang, the diviner at the Temple of Great Yu.

Yang Fang declared: "You are destined to be granted a military commission to suppress the rampant demonic hordes in the northeast. This lot is no auspicious omen. If you go, the portent will manifest within one hundred and twenty days—you are fated for a violent death." Chen, dismayed, had Yang Fang imprisoned on a forced confession to await verification.

Upon arriving at court, Chen was indeed appointed as the Pacification Commissioner of Nazhou, entrusted with military command to quell the bandit forces of Hu E Mountain in Qizhou, who had plundered the region under He Qing’s leadership. As soon as Chen took command, he was ambushed by raiders in the night. His forces scattered in panic, and he plunged into a ravine, helpless to resist. Suddenly, lightning split the darkness, revealing a long-haired deity wielding a sword who beckoned to Chen. Unaware, Chen found himself mounted alongside the spirit, both restored to the path. Gradually, the people returned, and the camp was reestablished. After several days of battle, He Qing and his followers were captured.

Chen detailed the events in a memorial to the throne and submitted Yang Fang’s divination as corroboration. The Three Departments reviewed the case and specially awarded Yang Fang an official post with monthly stipends to oversee the incense offerings at the Temple of Great Yu. The court dispatched an imperial envoy to present sacred incense at the Qianming Abbey and perform a grand rite of thanksgiving for Zhenwu’s divine intervention.

Those who delight in killing meet swift retribution in shortened lives and death, while Chen, though cast into the jaws of death, was spared. The Most High has said: "To wrongfully kill is to invite the blade of war to claim lives in turn. Some women, through illicit unions or abortions, harm living beings. A woman’s proper place is within the home; by cherishing purity, the inner chambers remain orderly and upright." *The Family Sayings of Confucius* states: "A man is capped at twenty, a woman betrothed at fifteen—only then are the Dao united and transformation complete, for destiny begins with this bond. Husband and wife are bound by heavenly principle, as father and son are. To neglect conduct and propriety, to deceive in secret, to seduce widows and abandoned women, to engage in clandestine affairs—such acts lead women astray. Swayed by private desires, they secretly conceive, then conceal their pregnancies, only to resort to burial or disposal. Unmindful of karmic consequences, heedless of retribution, they employ deceit at the moment of birth to silence gossip—such cases are legion.

Moreover, the penal code forbids the scandal of men and women mingling without distinction, to curb licentiousness and disorder. Yet some masters engage in illicit relations with their maidservants; when the servant conceives, whether the child is raised or not depends on the mistress’s whim. If she denies the servant proper care during childbirth, leading to her death, not only the mistress but the master who fathered the child share the guilt. Others, burdened by many children, casually abandon them. Though they may evade earthly law, unseen retribution draws near, and ghostly reckoning follows.

Have you not heard of Yingniang and the daughter of Wang Yaochen, or the cautionary tale of Ji Kexin’s daughter? There was a woman named Yingniang, a streetwalker weary of pregnancy and resentful of her many children. She repeatedly induced abortions in secret. Once more with child, she took drugs to expel the fetus, but the blood flowed uncontrollably. For six years, she lay bedridden, tormented by a thousand afflictions. One day, her family clearly saw several infants in swaddling clothes, their jade-like limbs writhing as they cried, "We demand our lives!" Only then did Yingniang’s breath cease.

According to *The Records of Puzhou*, Ji Kexin had a daughter named Yinfeng who fell ill and entered the underworld. After several days, she revived and told her father: "At first, two officials escorted me into a city. On either side stood numerous compounds, each gate bearing a placard. I saw one enclosure where countless sinners—men bound and forced to embrace a blazing bronze pillar, women pressed against a massive iron grill—were overseen by ox-headed and horse-faced guards wielding halberds. The moment they were thrust forward, their cries of agony were unbearable. Unable to watch, I asked the attending official, who replied, ‘This is the retribution for those who indulged in lust and destroyed life in their past existence.’

Later, they led me to a hall where a king sat enthroned, flanked by purple-robed officials. Soon, many women burdened with infants were dragged in, their wails rising as they cried for justice. The king questioned them without pause, and in an instant, their fates were sealed. I heard that such retribution in the afterlife determines the separation of loved ones, poverty, suffering, the severing of lineage, and the consequences of debauchery." Ji Kexin recorded her words as a warning to the world.

*The Record of Divine Manifestations* further relates: Wang Yaochen, a Supervisor of the Ministry of Revenue in Shuzhou, had a daughter who conceived out of wedlock. For two years, she did not give birth. Distressed, Wang ordered two maidservants to monitor her for misconduct. Shamed by the scrutiny, the girl fled to the garden and hanged herself. Suddenly, a voice from the void rebuked her: "A woman must not wrongfully discard her life!" The maidservants, hearing this, rushed to save her, cutting the rope and carrying her back. Wang, astonished, summoned the Daoist Chen Juxun of the Lingxian Abbey to report the matter and invoke the protection of Zhenwu at the family shrine.

During the ritual, the girl’s spirit suddenly possessed the deity and confessed her past sins: "In a former life, I was a medicine woman who secretly sold poison to induce abortions, wrongfully taking noble lives. For this crime, the Celestial Emperor was enraged and condemned me to endure humiliation in this life—my womb filled with toxic qi as if pregnant. Now, by the grace of the Supreme Perfected, I was spared from hanging and a worse rebirth." With these words, she revived. Wang Yaochen then performed a grand rite of thanksgiving to Zhenwu and disseminated the tale as a warning to the world.

*The Chapter on the Generation of Spirits* states: "To be reborn in the human realm, to be cleansed by the radiance of the Great Yang, is a blessing beyond measure. What grievance have you against such a fate that you would recklessly take life, abandon children, or resent their abundance?"

Those who frequently appear in litigation halls should heed Laozi’s words: *"To know the constant is called illumination; not knowing it leads to reckless action and misfortune."* This refers to cunning deceit. Those who repeatedly engage in lawsuits and enter official courts—do they not resort to coercion, oppression, or overbearing force to prevail? Confucius said: *"In hearing litigation, I am no different from others. What truly matters is to ensure there is no litigation at all."*

Generally, only when officials are upright and wise can they discern right from wrong, render just decisions, and settle disputes—thus silencing both parties. If they are corrupt and foolish, abandoning the law for bribes, shielding the obstinate, or colluding with crafty clerks, the wronged will harbor grievances with no recourse. Alas, they do not realize that every law and statute is overseen by the celestial and terrestrial bureaus, the water offices, and the underworld. Punishment is administered in both the seen and unseen realms, with governance unified in principle—retribution leaves not the slightest deviation.

*The Divine Decrees of Lan Sheng* states: *"Serve your lord with diligence, govern with earnest care, shun ill-gotten wealth, turn a deaf ear to wicked schemes, rectify judicial errors, and succor the people. Act in accord with the kingly Way, and you shall be a fortunate person. Accumulate transgressions, and you invite calamity—even descent into the depths."*

*The Record of Blessings* recounts: I was once summoned to the netherworld and encountered a fellow townsman, Yu Bing, who wore a cangue while two underworld officers detained him. Weeping, he pleaded with me: *"In life, I forcibly encroached upon my neighbor Zhang Xian’s vacant land by three feet to build a drainage ditch for my eaves. Zhang Xian repeatedly sued me, but to no avail, and the matter faded with time. Now, in the underworld, he has brought suit against me, and I must accept my guilt. Yet I have no way to inform my son—he has drifted to Jianchang, while Zhang Xian’s son has moved to Shaanfu. The paths of the living and the dead are sundered. Now, by fortune, you return to the world. I beg you to convey this message with urgency: compel my son to swiftly cede the land, that I may be released. Otherwise, I shall remain bound here forever."* Upon reviving, I fulfilled his request, and the tale spread through the world.

*The Records of Qi Sheng* document the case of Qian Ju, a commoner from Caizhou, who falsely accused his own brother of being unrelated by blood, denying him a share of their family’s tens of thousands in assets. He bribed officials, and his brother’s lawsuit was suppressed. The matter was later referred to the Imperial Censorate, which dispatched Xu Yi, the Vice Prefect of Xuzhou, to Caizhou to establish a prison and conduct an inquest. The investigating officer, Yang Zhonghe, had accepted Qian Ju’s bribes and fabricated evidence, altering the testimony of the witness Zhu Xijie to frame the innocent. Xu Yi, reckless and negligent, failed to investigate thoroughly and sentenced Zhu Xijie to thirteen strokes of the arm-caning, unjustly severing his case. After Xu Yi’s term ended, his performance review stalled, so he visited the Tianqing Abbey and commissioned the Daoist priest Pei Junshi to submit a petition for divine aid in securing a promotion.

Late into the night, Pei burned the petition before the altar and remained in vigil until the fourth watch. He then addressed Xu Yi: *"When I reached the Gate of the Three Heavens, I saw the Northern Emperor leading Zhenwu inside to memorialize your improper handling of Qian Ju’s case in Caizhou. The Celestial Decree declared: ‘Xu Yi’s petition is to remain here. I fear the Register of the Golden Script will summon you for questioning, and your response will surely err—this bodes grave peril.’ I immediately returned."* Xu Yi, struck with terror, soon died.

The investigating officer, Yang Zhonghe, was so shaken that he resigned his post, distributed his wealth, and devoted himself to charity, boldly amending his ways. When his fortune was exhausted, he subsisted on porridge, and at death, his body dissolved in transcendence. Zhenwu recruited him to serve as the Registrar of Official Appointments in the Eastern Marchmount’s Yama Bureau. The matter reached the Celestial Throne, and an edict was issued conferring upon Yang Zhonghe the title *Wuben Fu Jun* ("Lord Who Awakened to the Origin"). A shrine was erected for him in Xuzhou, where people now pay reverence.

To pervert right into wrong and punish the innocent is to violate the law for personal gain, emboldening litigious scoundrels. To sever kinship and corrupt moral teachings—how can one not fear the true overseers of heaven and earth? When the Celestial Emperor metes out punishment, how will you escape?

At every turn, one sinks into the Sea of Suffering. "Every" signifies each and every affair. "Sinking" denotes the obscuring of one’s conduct and concealment. "Suffering" is the self-inflicted torment. "Sea" is a metaphor for the boundless affairs of the living world. The *Yuan Dong Yu Li Zhang* states: "The Sea of Suffering is likened to a burning house that ensnares worldly people, who, bound by delusion and attachment, form bonds with wayward companions, unaware of the turning of kalpas. They delight only in the pleasures of the multitude, yet find no true peace. Fire, born of the friction of wood, transforms into a sea of scorching agony."

The Buddha spoke of the four conditioned states—love as a condition for love, birth as a condition for birth, aging, sickness, and death—as the torments of boiling affliction. To emerge and vanish, to be entangled and disturbed, to rise and sink—this is the vast sea of the world. The Venerable Taihua said: "By reversing profit, by distinguishing high and low, by ordering before and after, by discerning noble and base, by recognizing decline and prosperity—without clinging, without attachment, without greed, without desire—one who can uphold this is as if riding a raft to cross the surging waves."

The *Scripture of Purity* states: "The reason sentient beings do not attain the true Dao is because of deluded thoughts. Once deluded thoughts arise, the spirit is startled. Once the spirit is startled, one becomes attached to the myriad things. Once attached to the myriad things, craving arises. Once craving arises, it becomes affliction. Affliction and false thoughts distress body and mind, leading to defilement and humiliation, drifting through the cycle of birth and death, forever sinking in the Sea of Suffering, forever losing the true Dao."

Master Bixu said: "Humans are but vessels, all belonging to the dust of the world. The sun and moon race in alternation, forming the cycles of arising and ceasing, the turning of the celestial gate and the earth’s axis, the wheel of rise and fall. Alas, worldly people indulge in the seven emotions and six desires, seeking only the fleeting pleasures of body and mind, giving rein to greed, anger, ignorance, killing, stealing, and lust—how difficult it is to transcend birth and death! Do they ever reflect that in life, their blessings are silently diminished, their years cut short by calamity, and in death, their karmic debts drag them into the hidden depths, where their souls are seized to atone for their sins?"

The *Book of Repentance* states: "North of the human realm lies the vast and foul Qibo Sea, its waters boundless and putrid. Within it stands Mount Fengdu, reaching up to the azure heavens and descending into the winds and springs. At its center lie the Nine Dark Realms, housing thirty-six great hells, established to purge the sins of the dead. The supreme ruler there is the Great Emperor of Fengdu in the Northern Darkness, who oversees all judgments and punishments. This includes the eighteen great Avīci Hells and the twenty-eight constellations’ prisons—all places of confinement and retribution. In these hells, grasses and trees are sharper than swords, fierce beasts capture souls, spewing smoke and fire that scorches the sky without cease. The hellish officials and ghostly clerks, stern and unyielding, torture the imprisoned souls—how could they show mercy?"

The Supreme Lord established these hellish realms as the place where one’s deeds in life receive their due retribution. The *Record of the Divine Manifestation* recounts: "Zhenwu ascended to the Grand Pure Realm to pay homage to his original master, the Most High Lord Lao. The Lord said: 'I have tasked you with subduing the demons of the world and bringing peace to the cosmos. Yet sentient beings still rush headlong into the wheel of rebirth, passing through hell. You must universally deliver them. Bestow blessings upon the good, transform the wicked with goodness, and further cultivate your own fruition.' Zhenwu reverently obeyed and composed a verse: 'When sentient beings cultivate goodness, they become as one with me. When I attain the fruit of realization, it is also due to their good causes.' Having recited this verse, he knelt to take his leave and returned to his post, leaving behind this admonition for the world: 'To cultivate the Dao of immortality, first cultivate the Dao of humanity. The Dao of humanity consists of reverence, humility, kindness to all, compassion, gentleness, benefiting others, aiding the living, devotion to uprightness, frugality in serving parents, practicing benevolence and righteousness, performing acts of kindness, restraining arrogance, not relying on power, pitying the orphaned and widowed, extending compassion—this is the Dao of humanity. If one cannot even cultivate the Dao of humanity, how much farther is the Dao of immortality?'"

To squander one’s estate: Scholars receive fields to offer sacrifices, and commoners farm to feed themselves, relying on the transformations of the four seasons and the abundance of the five grains. Even a single measure of beans is allotted by fate. Yet some, though their fields stretch across the countryside and their granaries overflow, still covet the fertile lands of others. Mozi said: "It is not that there is no secure dwelling, but that there is no secure heart." Laozi said: "No misfortune is greater than insatiable desire." The *Scripture of Responding to the Times* states: "In the world to come, sentient beings will be benighted and unable to awaken. They will seek distant gains, forcibly amass wealth, and strive to enrich their descendants for generations, encroaching upon lands to build mansions—this is cultivating karma to await its retribution."

Generally, the measure of one’s fields and blessings is decreed by heaven, with abundance or scarcity naturally determined. How could one greedily seize what is not theirs? To falsely accuse a woman of squandering her estate is to accumulate the sinful qi of complacency and arrogance. The celestial overseers take note, and this sin of covetousness will erase your fields and homes from the registers, visibly dissolving your estate.

The *Exhortation of the Dark Emperor* states: "With a tranquil body and mind, no disasters or defilements arise. Cherishing things and exploring nature, one remains naturally free from illness. Discerning the wise and foolish, the dull-witted will naturally vanish. Illuminated and clear-sighted, worldly entanglements diminish. If one’s mind is empty and spiritually attuned, what trace of reality remains? Coming and going, the essence of qi ascends. Thunder, lightning, and mighty storms—all the people of the world witness them. Swift retribution is manifest, clearly revealed in the heavens. Do not obscure your original heart, nor indulge in excessive divination. Cherish your kin, live in harmony like springtime. Treat neighbors as family, reduce greed and increase affection. Rescue the distressed, aid the poor, be loyal, sincere, and frugal. Cleanse away obstinate dust, live in harmony and joy. Uphold purity and guard clarity, and the divine will bless your wishes. Your lifespan will be unharmed, and your descendants will thrive. In life, you will avoid the fetters of suffering and calamity; in death, you will escape the clamor of the underworld’s trials. Today, I write this universal exhortation. May those who gaze upon it be spared from misfortune. If one copies ten scrolls and posts them in all directions, plagues and pestilences will not dare appear. But if fools, in their anger, slander my words, their souls will be seized and sent straight to Fengdu for punishment."

Dissipating wealth and resources is to be avoided.

The most urgent task in managing one’s fate is securing clothing and food, for these depend on wealth to sustain the body and nourish the household. *Master Zhuang* said: "If wealth is not accumulated, those who rely on it will suffer. Seeking riches through strange or improper means is merely a path to temporary abundance." *Master Mo* said: "It is not that there is insufficient wealth, but that the heart lacks contentment." *Confucius* said: "Wealth and honor are what all people desire, yet if they are obtained by improper means, one should not dwell in them." *Laozi* said: "No misfortune is greater than not knowing contentment," and further: "Knowing contentment brings no disgrace."

The *Scripture of the Void Sovereign* states: "Wealth is the root of sustenance. Accumulating wealth is like accumulating karma, for wealth is the root of desire and can give rise to all sins. Hoarding excessively leads only to ruin." Yet people remain ignorant of this. The ghostly enforcer Pei Pu once dreamed of his friend Wei Yuanfang, who said: "I oversee the daily expenditures of the world—every sip, every bite, every resource—all are recorded, and their acquisition is limited. Should one take even a single item or coin beyond what is allotted, I command legions of ghostly soldiers to seize it. This matter falls under the jurisdiction of the Fengdu Court’s *Zhoujue Yintian* General Bureau, which governs the confiscation of ill-gotten wealth. We dispatch spirits from the original cavern to be reborn into such households, waiting for the appointed time to dissipate their wealth."

According to the *Scripture of Blessing and Protection*, the *Perfected One Who Preserves Life* said: "Do not harm the worthy with malice, lest Heaven send misfortune. Do not disrespect parents, lest Heaven grow angry. Do not slander the sages, lest Heaven bring disaster. Do not covet unjust gain, lest Heaven diminish you. Do not harm others, lest Heaven cast you down. Do not injure others, lest Heaven repay you in kind."

The *Divine Edicts of the Dark Emperor* state: "Those who falsely seek glory will find their reputation unspread. Those who amass wealth through exploitation will leave calamity for their descendants. Those who practice kindness and bestow virtue will see fortune and blessings take flight. Those who restrain desire and moderate their diet will enjoy long life. Do not deceive in darkness, nor obscure the Three Luminaries. Be upright and selfless, loyal and true of heart. Heaven and Earth will intercede, and the divine will stand guard at your side. To extend life and overcome hardship, one must surely bring peace to the times. Yet if misfortune arises, it is by one’s own fault. As *Tai Jia* said: 'If Heaven brings disaster, it may yet be avoided. But if one brings disaster upon oneself, there is no escape.' Wherever the divine generals reside, fierce demons lower their heads, and evil ways flee in terror."

In any place where halls or temples are built for the sacred image of the Dark Emperor, or where households display his likeness, jealous spirits and fierce demons, upon hearing the name of the true overseers, will cower in submission. Should they stir up misfortune or evil, they will vanish at the sight of the divine banners. Thus, those who revere him will find fortune rising like clouds, while calamity scatters like lightning.

As the *Book of Songs* says: "Illuminating service to the Highest Emperor brings abundant blessings." The *Instructions of the Soaring Sage* state: "Offer incense with reverence to the lofty heavens, guard your nature and refine your being within. If you can embody this sincerity, blessings will naturally follow, fortune and felicity will pursue you, and auspicious qi will arise."

Auspicious qi manifests in five forms: the first is *qingyun*, the "cloud of fortune," seen as a joyful omen and the harbinger of blessings. It gathers the Five Fortunes, and a hundred blessings will descend upon your body. Fortune is the smooth progression of affairs; what is harmonious is called fortune. The *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* says: "When true qi descends from the five directions, ten thousand blessings naturally converge." *Converge* means to gather as one. It further states: "Dispel the Three Disasters and Nine Calamities, and ensure peace in this present spring."

The *Book of Documents* says: "Only Heaven sends down disasters; auspiciousness lies in virtue." The *Scripture of Salvation* states: "Ten thousand calamities will not approach; divine protectors will guard your gate. Thunder and lightning, celestial soldiers, and scribes will always accompany you, dispersing disasters and anomalies."

You have earnestly inquired, and so I reveal this mechanism, tracing the subtle origins of the Dao’s records to bring great blessings to the people of Heaven. Though my words are brief, I wish for you to understand them clearly. Were I not a perfected being, this knowledge would rightfully remain secret.

The Dark Emperor spoke to Miao Xing, saying: "Do you have karmic affinity from past lives that prompts your earnest questions today?" The *Dao’s records* refer to the years of transmission and ordination, used to verify the subtle origins of the Dark Warrior’s mysteries. Those who faithfully uphold them are called the *People of Heaven*, who receive great blessings.

*Master Zhuang* said: "Those who cultivate themselves are now as they have always been—constant and unwavering. When people align with them, Heaven aids them. Those whom people abandon are called the People of Heaven." According to the *True Instructions of Supreme Clarity*: "People born into the world who do not cultivate the Dao are no different from grasses, trees, birds, or beasts—they are called ordinary people. Among ordinary people, those who awaken and set their minds on cultivation, seeking long life, may study these essential scriptural teachings. Then, the mysteries we practice will become clear to them."

*Master Zhuang* said: "Those who do not depart from the true are called *perfected beings*." *Master Xun* said: "One who understands the distinction between Heaven and humanity may be called a *perfected being*." Without such understanding, how could one be called *perfected*? Consider the case of Han Yuanshou: though he meditated deeply in seclusion and recited scriptures diligently, his focus was not single-minded. One day, heavenly fire burned his house, and his scriptures flew into the sky. After ninety years, Yuanshou transformed into a tree spirit. If even such a man faced such retribution, how much more severe will be the consequences for those today who treat transmission lightly?

Thus concludes *The Wondrous Scripture of the Dark Emperor of the Primordial Heaven, the Perfected Martial Sage, with Divine Spells and Origins*, Scroll Four.

*The Wondrous Scripture of the Dark Emperor of the Primordial Heaven, the Perfected Martial Sage, with Divine Spells and Origins*, Scroll Five

Compiled and annotated by Chen Hong of the *Ernei Teachings of Ascending the Mysteries*, a layman of Fangtian

The Perfected One said: "May the wondrous principles be heard once more." Miao Xing again inquired: "The Dark Emperor’s wondrous workings and profound principles are beyond comprehension. As you now address the assembly of the true, I humbly request an explanation of the causes of his merits."

The Dark Emperor said: "In the first year of *Yongshou*, on the *Upper Prime* day—*Yongshou* refers to a past era, and the *Upper Prime* is the first day of the first lunar month—the *Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity at the North Pole’s Center* accompanied the *Primordial Beginning* on his eightfold jade carriage to listen to the Dharma. On that day, he was commanded to dispatch generals to exterminate demons. By the *Middle Prime* day, an edict from the *August Ultimate* descended, and he was summoned to the *Palace of Purple Tenuity* to receive investiture for his meritorious service."

The *Yongshou* era of the *Dragon-Han* epoch was an imperial reign title of the *Central Heaven of Highest Heaven*. The *Upper Prime* and *Middle Prime* festivals, though two distinct observances, both occurred within the span of a single year. The *Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning* resided in the *Palace of Eightfold Radiance*, seated upon a throne of five-colored clouds. Here, *resided* denotes his august abode, while *seated* signifies his ascent to the exalted position. At that time, the *Great Celestial Emperor of Primordial Beginning* departed the *Sacred Precinct of Jade Purity* in his divine carriage, journeying to the *Great Empyrean of the Northeast*. There, he dispatched the *Five Elder Heavenly Lords* with a special mandate to summon all the *Celestial Emperors of the Heavens* to assemble at this celestial court and listen to the recitation of the *Scripture of Salvation for Humanity*.

The Dao declares: In ancient times, within the *Azure Heaven of Primordial Beginning*, amidst the *Vast Azure Void* and the *Great Floating Li Realm*, he received from the *Primordial Beginning* the *Supreme and Boundless Salvation of Humanity*. The *Eightfold Radiance of Primordial Azure* was formed from the coalescence of the *qi* of the *Three Yangs of the Great Numinous Cavern*, the *Nine Perfected*, and the *Grand Unity*. Upon a throne of five-colored auspicious clouds and a lion’s dark seat, the *Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning* ascended. There, he was attended by the *Thirty-Six Celestial Emperors of the Heavens*—*attended* here connoting reverent reception.

At that time, the *Jade Emperor of August Heaven* led the *Three Preeminent Emperors of the Upper, Middle, and Central Heavens*, along with the *Thirty-Two Celestial Emperors of the Four Quarters*, all proceeding to the *Cinnabar Terrace*. Each assembled in solemn order, arraying themselves in ranks to offer homage.

The *Scripture of Salvation for Humanity* records: When the *Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning* was to expound this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions, only then ascending his throne. The *Eight Heavens of the East* were governed by: the *Celestial Emperor of the Supreme August Yellow Prime Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Great Brightness Jade Perfection Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Luminous Clarity Harmonious Youth Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Mysterious Womb Nurturing Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Primordial Brightness Literary Elevation Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Upper Brightness Seven Luminaries Majestic Yi Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Void Transcending Journey Heaven*, and the *Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate Veiled Heaven*.

The *Eight Heavens of the South* were governed by: the *Celestial Emperor of the Vermilion Brightness Harmonious Yang Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Mysterious Brightness Reverent Splendor Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Radiant Brightness Ancestral Whirlwind Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Bamboo Grove August Elixir Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Void Brightness Hall Radiance Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Contemplative Brightness Upright Tranquility Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Mysterious Brightness Reverent Celebration Heaven*, and the *Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Flaming Ultimate Jade Heaven*.

The *Eight Heavens of the West* were governed by: the *Celestial Emperor of the Primordial Load Kong Ascension Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Great Peace August Cliff Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Manifest Stability Ultimate Wind Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Primordial August Filial Radiance Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Supreme August Aged Heavy Floating Countenance Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Thoughtless River Flow Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Upper Divination Joyous Heaven*, and the *Celestial Emperor of the Boundless Cloud Vow Heaven*.

The *Eight Heavens of the North* were governed by: the *Celestial Emperor of the Luminous Court Empyrean Crossing Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Abyssal Penetration Primordial Cavern Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Great Literary Flourish Adorned Wondrous Completion Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Simplicity Elegant Music Forbidden Upper Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Void Non-Abiding Constant Fusion Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Release Jade Dragon Ascendant Victory Heaven*, the *Celestial Emperor of the Dragon Transformation Brahman Crossing Heaven*, and the *Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate Level Nurturing Jia Yi Heaven*.

The *Four Heavens of the Center* were governed by: the *Jade Emperor of August Heaven of the Golden Portal*, the *Great Emperor of Longevity and Primordial Sage Ancestor*, the *Great Emperor of the Celestial August Thearch of Purple Tenuity*, and the *Great Emperor of the North Pole’s Center of Purple Tenuity of Middle Heaven*.

The *Seventy-Two Perfected of the Blessed Lands*—officers of the *Mystic Altar of the Celestial Treasury*—were charged, according to the *Scripture of Salvation for Humanity*, with the *Primordial Beginning’s Mandate*, their ranks advancing in due time. These immortals in their official capacities, whenever they emit a true thought, do so for the benefit of the world. They oversee the mountains and rivers, and when recording the registers for the celestial audience, they assist in the deliverance of the perfected and the ascension of immortals, conducting the rites as the various perfected officials rotate in their duties. The *Perfected of the Lung of the Earth Blessed Land* serves as the leader of the ranks, presiding over the assembly.

The *Perfected of the Blessed Lands* include: the *Perfected of the Bamboo Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Pure Distant Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Peaceful Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Stone Rubble Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Eastern Immortal Source Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Azure Islet Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Dense Wood Hollow Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Red Water Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Cinnabar Radiance Cavern Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Lord Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Cassia Source Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Numinous Cavern Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Fertile Prefecture Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Heavenly Mother Peak Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Ruo Ye Ford Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Golden Court Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Horse Ridge Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Goose Sheep Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Cavern of Perfection Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Pure Jade Altar Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Heavenly Light Altar Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Cavern Palace Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Pottery Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Cavern Numinous Source Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Three Sovereigns Well Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Rotten Axe Handle Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Le Stream Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Dragon Tiger Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Numinous Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Spring Source Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Carefree Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Converging Mound Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Beginning Abundance Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Golden Essence Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Eastern White Source Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Alms Bowl Pool Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Discourse Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Mao Public Altar Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Chicken Coop Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Paulownia Cypress Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Level Capital Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Green Creeping Vine Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Manifest Contemplation Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Embracing Fortune Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Great Face Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Tiger Ford Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Chen Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Horse Hoof Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Virtue Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Indigo Water Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Jade Peak Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Heavenly Eye Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Shang Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Zhang Public Cavern Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Fish Lake Cavern Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Central Ridge Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Sima Sea Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Silk Bamboo Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Sweet Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Soul Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Golden City Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Cloud Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Martial Peace Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Grand Harmony Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Woman’s Loom Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Lesser Chamber Mountain Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Mount Lu Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Western Mountain Source Blessed Land*, the *Perfected of the Southern Field Mountain Blessed Land*, and the *Perfected of the Embracing Calf Mountain Blessed Land*.

All the *Celestial Emperors of the Heavens* eternally occupy their celestial positions.

The Perfected of all Blessed Lands shall each heed the Jade Emperor’s rotational assignments and accept their appointed duties. Their governance, merits, and faults shall be subject to review for promotion or demotion.

The boundless *Flying Heavenly Deities*, the *Infinite Long-Life Great Sages*, the *Golden Lads and Jade Maidens*, the *Nine Phoenixes and Eight Luan Birds*—all stand radiant in attendance, arrayed to left and right. "Boundless" signifies the immeasurable; "infinite," the unfathomable; "limitless," the ultimate. Such is the innumerable host of attendants.

Moreover, beneath the celestial palaces of all heavens, the ranks of courtiers, officials, and functionaries stand in solemn array. The *Flying Heavenly Deities* serve as the scribes and chariot-drivers of the celestial bureaucracy, overseeing ritual regalia and sacred implements. As the *Great Precepts Sutra* states: "Those of old who mastered the precepts, cultivated diligent practice, and never regressed were acknowledged as pure and faithful adepts. Upon the fulfillment of their destiny and the end of their lives, they were specially appointed as *Flying Heavenly Deities* of valor in the heavens."

The *Long-Life Great Sages* are ministers who oversee the Three Departments, recording the merits of cultivation across the Three Realms. According to the *Jade Dawn’s Hidden Basket*: "For disciples of the Lower Realm caught in the swift cycles of pestilence, if their hearts depart from worldly darkness and their resolve remains unshaken, their spiritual powers and wisdom reach their zenith, and the radiance of Dharma, spirit, and wisdom pierces the heavens—thus entering the Dao of true constancy—they shall be welcomed by celestial immortals. By imperial decree, they are appointed to the ranks of celestial officials, presiding over the registers of life."

The *Golden Lads* hold the office of *Marquis of Peaceful Village*, akin to the *Attendant Gentleman of the Palace* in the mortal realm. As the *House Biographies of the Han Celestial Masters* records: "Zifang and Ziyuan both served as lads in the *Supreme Clarity Palace*, attending the *Venerable Lord*."

The *Jade Maidens* fulfill roles as messengers of refined virtue, comparable to imperial consorts and court ladies. According to the *Primal Chaos Sutra*: "From the primordial *qi*, clouds coalesced into pavilions. Through breath and invocation, numinous talismans transformed into light, and *Golden Lads and Jade Maidens* bore standards and canopies."

The *Phoenixes and Luan Birds* are sacred fowl, originating from the *Cinnabar Cavern* and *Female Bathing* mountains in the Southern Sea. The *Nine Phoenixes*—nine forming a single flock—are styled as such, serving the *Three Clarities*. Together, they number eighty-one, and their movements compose the *Nine Shao* melodies, harmonizing with the music of the *Jade Clarity*, *Supreme Clarity*, and *Great Clarity* heavens. The *Eight Luan Birds*—eight forming a single flock—are styled as such, numbering sixty-four in total. Their dances align with the *Eight Refined Movements*, complementing the rites of the *Cavern of Perfection*, *Cavern of Mystery*, and *Cavern of Divinity*. These birds stand eight or nine *chi* tall, their plumage resplendent, their radiance undiminished until the dance’s end. Thereafter, they encircle the heavens, standing guard to left and right. The *Eight Sounds* resonate spontaneously, and all the sages rejoice.

The *Eight Sounds* refer to the harmonies of instruments shaped by the Eight Trigrams. "Spontaneous resonance" arises when the divine wind stirs the *qian* forest, producing tones. Only in the Three Realms and Nine Heavens does the wondrous *self-sounding celestial music* emerge—from the branches and leaves of *linlang* jewel-trees—each note a marvel of *gong* and *shang* cadence. There are the chimes of jade and stone, the rhythms of drums and *kan* leather, the melodies of *sheng* reeds and *gen* gourds, the flutes of *zhen* bamboo, the strikes of *xun* and *yu* wood, the strumming of *qin* and *se* strings, the tunes of *xun* and *fou* clay, and the clangs of *rao* cymbals and *dui* metal. As the *Numinous Treasure Sutra* declares:
*"The towering realm of the Jade Palace stands,
With forests of blossoms swaying in grace.
The divine wind stirs the cavern’s echo,
Ensuring boundless years in this place."*

This sublime music, resounding with natural clarity, most benefits those who hear it, preserving their true nature in its entirety. Thus, all in attendance rejoice in its beauty.

Now, hearken solemnly to the *Celestial Worthy* expound the wondrous Dharma of the *Utmost Perfection*. "Hearken solemnly" signifies the reverent attention of the assembly to the discourse. The *Dharma of the Utmost Perfection* is the esoteric scripture of the *Middle Vehicle of the Cavern of Mystery*, which initiates the Nine Perfected of the heavens.

This teaching comprises twelve divisions, each with its own hierarchy:
1. *Numinous Harmony Division*
2. *Numinous Treasure Division*
3. *Spirit Communication Division*
4. *Boundless Division*
5. *Immortal Assembly Division*
6. *Inner Esoteric Division*
7. *Utmost Perfection Division*
8. *Virtue Cultivation Division*
9. *Essence Refinement Division*
10. *Life Portal Division*
11. *Officials and Charts Division*
12. *Demon Subjugation Division*

Together, these divisions encompass eighty-four thousand scrolls. The *Primal Beginning* bestowed them upon the *Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord*, sealing them eternally within the *Jade Capital Heavenly Terrace* of the *Mystic Metropolis*. Their texts are complete across the Thirty-Six Heavens. Though the immortals of sacred mountains, grotto-heavens, seas, and peaks may engage in cultivation, they have only heard of these divisions’ titles—how could they fully attain this vehicle? Even less so for the scholars and common folk of the lower realms. The scriptures now disseminated in the world derive from the second division: the wondrous *Numinous Treasure Unfolding Charts Sutra*.

The *Sutra of Responding to the Era* records the words of an elder from the Western Regions: "Generally, all wonders converge in a single gateway. If mortals inwardly align with the cyclical movements of *yin* and outwardly embody the firmness and softness of *yang*, guiding them through the Five Constants and receiving them in a single *qi*—within this gateway, they may discern the gradual path. Thus, the spirit-*qi* descends and stills. Once the spirit is stilled, the hundred demons retreat in silence. This is the numinous Dharma, wherein all *qi* are harmonized. When *qi* is harmonized and still, the Four Great Elements become pure—this is the alchemical transformation, the Great Treasure."

The *Dao-qi* is purified, encircling the *Supreme Mystery*. "Purified" denotes the solemn and pristine *qi* of the Utmost Dao. Thus, clarity and radiance coalesce into the sovereign of spiritual transformation. The flowing secrets of the *Cavern Precepts* ascend to the *Supreme Clarity* and encompass the *Cavern of Divinity* below—this is the encircling of the *Supreme Mystery*. As the *Numinous Treasure Unfolding Charts Sutra* states: "The *Primal Beginning* employed the ancestral *qi* of the *Numinous Treasure*, merging it with the *Primordial Azure Qi* to govern the heavens, earth, ghosts, and spirits, nurturing the world. The *qi* of life embraces the soul, refining and safeguarding the Great Harmony, permeating the Lower Realm and its people."

At that time, the Primordial Beginning commanded the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign, inscribing with a purple brush to record and expand the Great Teaching, that its compassionate grace might flow forth and guide learners. According to the Western Venerable Elder: "The Supreme Mystery descends to the subtle, responding to the turning of the celestial pivot. The Flower Chamber governs the assembly of *qi*, while the Purple Palace gathers numinous might." This is the essential Dao of returning to truth, the gateway and window to penetrating the Mystery.

When a superior adept first ascends to the *Numinous Treasure*, beginning to knock at the gate of the Mysterious Principle, one must be led and guided—this method responds to the moment, seeking the return to the abode. Only then may the wondrous principles be studied with precision. "Only then" refers to the methods of the *Numinous Treasure*'s wondrous principles. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, for the sake of all, expounded the subtle and profound, so that the myriad sages might delve deeply into its ultimate essence.

The Left Immortal Elder elucidated the *Numinous Treasure*'s precept-methods: The *Numinous Treasure*'s original *qi* was at first a singular undifferentiated whole. From the source-stream of the Great Void, it ascended and descended through the various heavens. Its numinous efficacy pervaded the distant and subtle, aiding and sheltering the host of immortals. Auspicious omens flourished in luxuriance, bestowing ranks and conferring perfect grace. By spirit descending and gathering, it became the forerunner of the Daoist method. By *qi* settling and stilling, it accorded with spontaneity.

In the northeast of the Heavenly Gate, the ancestral *qi* unfolded its transformations, and the ninefold heavens arrayed the thirty-six heavens. The utmost above is called the Great Loftiness; the three realms of heaven are the capital heavens. Between the capital heaven and the northeast gate lies what is named the *Supreme Clarity of the Eight Effulgences*, the *Primordial Azure Heaven*. The Primordial Beginning often expounded the great *Numinous Treasure* teachings within this heaven, which covers the northeast of the lower realm, above the ghostly paths of the wilds.

When the *Sublime Scripture of Salvation for Humanity, Supreme Grade* was proclaimed, the myriad sages all assembled in the *Primordial Azure Heaven* to receive the Primordial Beginning’s boundless, supreme salvation for humanity. Seven great sounds shook the heavens, and ten eyes gazed as one, beholding the karmic demons of the lower world and the foul *qi* surging toward the heavens. The host of perfected ones fell silent, and the Great Dao became still.

The "seven sounds" refer to the seven emotions of the mortal realm—joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, worry, resentment, and thought. The innocent suffer curses and punishments, crying out to heaven in anguish, their bitter suffering startling the celestial audience. As the saying goes: "Whispers among men are heard in heaven like thunder"—this is what is meant by the great shaking.

At that assembly, ten eyes gazed as one upon the lower realm, where the four kinds of birth endured kalpas, their forms and lives transformed, their inner and outer *qi* exhausted in cycles. As the *Record of Rites* states: "What ten eyes see and ten hands point to is most severe"—this expresses the depth of their concern. Thus, the multitudes of the ten directions fell silent in unison, mourning the sentient beings.

Reverently contemplating the Great Dao, the Primordial Beginning, the Most High, remained motionless and silent, yet responsive and all-pervading. According to the *Numinous Treasure Repentance*: At that time, the Primordial August Thearch emitted a divine radiance to illuminate below, revealing the demonic hosts of the Six Heavens—*Kejia* and their ilk—marching through the mortal world, entangling the living and the seven generations of deceased ancestors, forming cliques to act with wanton violence. Their conflicts and slaughters knew no day or night, leaving corpses and bloodshed strewn about. The *qi* of resentment and wails of sorrow transformed into toxic *qi*, surging against the celestial radiance.

Then the Wondrous Conduct Perfected One, hearing of this before the Primordial Beginning, asked: "Having expounded the wondrous Dharma and assembled auspicious signs, what is this strange cause that now intrudes? May you bestow profound guidance to resolve the doubts of the assembly." At that moment, the Wondrous Conduct Perfected One, unaware of the reason for these strange omens, posed this question, seeking clarification.

The Primordial Beginning is the Most Honored among the myriad heavens, the sovereign of the unsurpassed Dharma. Having expounded the wondrous Dharma, he constantly saves and delivers all, harmonizing extraordinary auspices. Why, then, did this strange cause intrude before the Primordial Beginning’s presence? The Wondrous Conduct Perfected One, perplexed, respectfully entreated the Purple Tenuity Great Emperor to reveal the profound meaning of the past, resolving the doubts of the great assembly.

The Great Emperor replied: "The people of the Lower Realm all receive the Ultimate Dao, endowed with the pure *qi* of primordial chaos to support and protect their mortal bodies. All embodied forms belong to the Lower Realm, governed by the Three *Qi* Lords. Each is imbued with the *Numinous Treasure*'s Ultimate Dao, the natural flow of primordial chaotic *qi* permeating and sustaining the creation of male and female bodies."

According to the *Various Scriptures*: The *Numinous Treasure*'s *Primordial Azure Qi* coalesces into the *Original Yang*, weighing three hundred eighty-four *zhu*, establishing the *qi* of life that falls into the void and sings through the channels. It courses through the meridians and vessels, corresponding to the three hundred sixty bones and limbs. The *qi* of the Great Floating Black Earth coalesces and transforms, cycling through yellow, white, azure, and red to conceive and congeal essence. The *Original One Yellow Evolved Qi* forms the placenta. The *Cavern Obscurity Purple Portal Qi* shapes the embryo. The *Numinous Brightness Immortal Qi* commands the hun-soul. The *Vast Corpse Obscure Evolved Qi* commands the po-soul. The *Five Immortals Central Numinous Qi* forms the viscera. The *Lofty Perfected Harmonious Qi* forms the bowels. The *Lofty Immortal Cavern Tome Qi* forms the origin. The *True Numinous Coalescing Qi* binds the flower. The *Spontaneous Mysterious Illumination Qi* binds the peaks. The *Jade Clarity Chaotic Obscurity Qi* transforms the mud-pill. The *Supreme Clarity Crimson Chaos Qi* transforms the Crimson Palace. The *Great Clarity Mysterious Pervasion Qi* transforms the Cinnabar Field.

The *Blazing Deluder*'s three *qi* descend as true fire, entering the heart and exiting the tongue, governing the warmth of the spirit-*qi*. The *Year Star*'s nine *qi* descend as true wood, entering the liver and exiting the eyes, governing the skin, hair, and body hair. The *Quelling Star*'s one *qi* descends as true earth, entering the spleen, stomach, and mouth, governing the flesh and four limbs. The *Great White*'s seven *qi* descend as true metal, entering the lungs and exiting the nose, governing the teeth and sinews. The *Chronos Star*'s five *qi* descend as true water, entering the kidneys and exiting the ears, governing the fluids, blood, and marrow.

The *qi* of the seven eastern asterisms governs the *Yang Brightness* meridian. The *qi* of the seven southern asterisms governs the *Greater Yang* meridian. The *qi* of the seven western asterisms governs the *Lesser Yin* meridian. The *qi* of the seven northern asterisms governs the *Greater Yin* meridian. The Azure Numinous Emperor Lord of the Eastern Dipper governs destiny. The White Standard Emperor Lord of the Western Dipper registers names. The Seven Governors of the Northern Dipper oversee the gathering of life.

The Six Governors of the Southern Dipper oversee its movements and functions. The Central Dipper’s *Primordial Numinous Great Emperor* binds and subdues the myriad spirits.

Zhuangzi said: "Humans inherit heaven and follow earth, arranging *qi* to form shape—this is called the numinous essence of beings." The *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* states: "Ordinary mortals in the world, deluded and confused, often do not know their bodies belong to the Northern Dipper, their lives governed by the Celestial Treasury. When disasters and calamities strike, they know not the gate of expiation and gratitude. Seeking to prolong fortune and life, they remain ignorant of the path to return to truth, causing their souls to be bound and misfortunes to accumulate."

The *Divinely Responsive Emperor Lord*, descending with his brush, proclaimed: "By the mandate of the Jade Emperor, I issue this compassionate decree. Moved by the plight of the common people, it is ordained that from the *Ding-Si* year of the Middle Prime Festival onward, all under heaven shall exhort one another to pool resources and establish the *Grand Ritual of the Three Realms, Illuminating Prosperity and Pacifying Clarity*. Those who perform this rite shall be delivered from the turbid waves of the final kalpic conflagration. The ritual protocols shall reverently invite my teachings, and disciples shall propagate the liturgy of the *Supreme Prolongation of Life*. They shall recite scriptures, ascend the altar, and present memorials to heaven and earth."

The *Divinely Responsive Emperor Lord* supervised the *Tai* Mountain Prefecture, where the Three Bureaus inscribed their names. The memorial was then submitted to the Three Celestial Gates, granting deliverance from the kalpic doom. Truly, is there no greater joy than this?

Now, as the kalpic cycle nears its end, demonic forces grow rampant. The *Sutra of Karmic Retribution* states: "At the dawn of each kalpa, it is the *Dragon Han* and *Red Clarity* era. The *Cavern of Truth* descends, and people embrace virtue and power, many attaining longevity. In the mid-kalpa, it is the *Supreme August* and *Prolonged Prosperity* era. The *Cavern of Mystery* descends, and people gradually abandon simplicity, losing the Dao and rebelling against virtue. At the kalpa’s end, it is the *Kaihuang* era’s conclusion. The *Cavern of Spirit* descends, and people grow frivolous, few upholding true rectitude. Heaven’s ordinances falter, and the world endures the three kalpas of *Kaihuang*." After the *Jia-Zi* year of the Upper Prime of the Song dynasty, the seventh *Kaihuang* kalpa began. Alas! In this final kalpa, calamities fill the heavens.

We witness the sun and moon eclipsed and dimmed, the five planets erring in their courses, the six extremes meting out punishments, the four barbarians waging war, fires burning and floods sweeping, droughts and locusts ravaging, frost, hail, and freezing storms descending, lands collapsing and mountains crumbling, serpents and tigers manifesting as omens, excessive punishments and cruel tyranny, human demons and ghostly specters, epidemics and untimely deaths—all named *kalpic retribution*.

The *Western Florescence Emperor Lord* said: "The kalpic cycles of heaven and earth alternate between adversity and prosperity, ending and responding in turn. The great cosmic pattern follows myriad transformations, its cessation and renewal cyclical. Yet the kalpa’s end and beginning are without limit or exhaustion. Only the sentient beings of the turbid world, bound to the kalpa, endure the wheel of rebirth—some facing the kalpa’s doom, some the *qi*-kalpa, some external calamities, some internal afflictions, some bodily tribulations, some fate’s trials. If beings’ primordial karma runs deep and their deeds remain benighted, when they encounter the kalpic realm, they drift like sand in the苦海, adrift and endless. When the kalpa reaches its end, it becomes eternal severance, transforming into the *qi* of dark resentment."

In the *Ding-Si* year of the *Qingyuan* reign, during the Upper Prime Festival, heaven sent down a jade missive to the *Zitong* Divine Temple in Jianzhou. The temple’s warden respectfully submitted the document to the imperial court. According to the report, *Zhang Yazhun*, the *Illustrious Martial and Valiant Numinous Assistant, Vast Salvation and Benevolent Tranquility King*, *Supervisor of the Golden Watchtower of the August Heaven*, *Perfected Master of the Nine Heavens’ Transformative Governance*, and *Zitong Divinely Responsive Emperor Lord*, received a memorial from the Three Celestial Gates via the Three Palace Envoys. It detailed the *Bing-Xu* year’s *Three Realms’ Spiritual Offering Assembly*, concluding the registration of the Lower Prime’s affairs before all departed.

At that time, the *August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven* ascended his throne to the *Upper Prime Supreme Unity Palace*. Emerging from the Three Celestial Gates, he surveyed the six directions and eight boundaries below, his gaze all-encompassing. Yet he saw only coils of grievance, wails of sorrow, and the innocent crying out to heaven—voices that pierced the celestial hearing.

The Jade Emperor issued a compassionate decree, addressing his attendant minister, the *Golden Watchtower Censor-in-Chief and Grand Preceptor of the Three Celestial Gates*, *Ge Hong*: "The living beings below—from high-ranking officials and rulers to local magistrates and clerks—enforce harsh laws and exorbitant taxes. Even the powerful families, great households, wealthy merchants, and major traders prioritize bribes in every action, pursuing only profit in all directions. They indulge in feasts, music, and sensual pleasures, disregarding reason, speaking falsely, and behaving like scavenging dogs. They treat parents, teachers, and kin with disdain and arrogance. The rich ignore the poor; the noble disdain the lowly. Marriages are contracted for wealth, alliances forged for worldly gain. They seize from the destitute, exploit the suffering, and refuse aid to the impoverished, driving many to ruin."

The Jade Emperor commanded the *Right Regular Attendant*, *Wang Qiao*, *Orator and Messenger Bearing the Jade Clarity Palace’s Edict*, *Yin Xi*, *Grand Preceptor of the Jade Clarity Palace and Guardian of the Purple Tenuity Enclosure’s Celestial Pivot Institute*, *Xu Jia*, *Grand Preceptor of the Supreme Clarity Palace and Guardian of the Purple Tenuity Enclosure’s Southern Culmen Institute*, *Zhang Daoling*, *Grand Preceptor of the Grand Clarity Palace and Guardian of the Purple Tenuity Enclosure’s Northern Culmen Institute*, the *Celestial August Emperor of the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace*, the *Mysterious Heavenly August Emperor of the Earth*, the *Three Officials Great Emperors of Heaven, Earth, and Water*, the *Four Marshal Sage Emperors*, *Yan Hui*, *Cultivator of Literature in the Celestial Treasury and Duke of Yan*, *Bu Shang*, *Cultivator of Literature in the Earthly Treasury and Duke of Henei*, *Qu Yuan*, *Cultivator of Literature in the Water Treasury and Duke of Qinglie*, the Venerable *Kasyapa*, the Venerable *Ananda*, and the Venerable *Pindola*—eighteen in total—to attend court and present their memorials before the throne.

The Jade Emperor spoke to the assembled ministers: "The living beings of the lower world now face the final kalpa. The Three Teachings are neglected: those who become monks or Daoists often disregard precepts and act without reason; scholars and commoners fail to honor the teachings of the revered Zhou and Confucius; and officials of high rank indulge in excess and corruption."

Moreover, the vast multitudes of living beings, following perverse customs, scorn the hundred grains, crave wealth like starving tigers, and spread poison like raging fire. They abandon the upright and follow the crooked, making such ways habitual and customary—those who transgress shall not be pardoned or absolved.

You, the assembled ministers, shall convene in the Celestial Court on the first day of the first month each year beginning in the *dingsi* year, to examine and record good and evil. Relying upon the numinous power of the Imperial Lords of the Void and the Boundless Realm, you shall first issue written decrees to announce these judgments to the earthly city gods and local deities, and likewise dispatch documents to the courts of the Five Marchmounts and Mount Tai, establishing this as an eternal statute. The Offices of Intent, Manifest Report, and Swift Report shall daily enforce strict scrutiny, transmitting reports in succession to the Celestial Prefecture.

In regions where the people do not follow the Way, do not uphold virtue, or fail to revere and trust in the teachings, retribution shall be measured by their transgressions: pestilence, drought, locusts, thunder and lightning, violent winds, sudden rains, killing frosts, hail, and freezing cold shall damage the hundred grains and deplete the earth’s bounty. The Four Barbarians shall invade, bringing the scourge of war and battle; the earth shall split and mountains collapse; serpents and tigers shall run rampant. Demonic spirits shall be sent to take birth in their households, destroying their foundations and annihilating their kin.

Yet if they reform their conduct, exert themselves in right action, and adhere to the words of the *Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian*, avoiding all enumerated transgressions, their misfortunes shall be transformed into blessings.

Thus is this decree issued. Let all take heed.

From the Three Celestial Gates, the Envoys of the Three Palaces hereby dispatch this document to the Imperial Lord of Numinous Response of Nine-Bend Phoenix Mountain for enforcement.

Those who stray into heterodox paths and neglect the cultivation of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and virtue shall be of this kind.

Those who fail to reflect upon their fundamental origins and resent the teachings and kindness of parents, teachers, and friends are of this kind. Those who delight in worshipping heterodox spirits and indulge in licentious sacrifices to disorderly gods, currying favor with earnest entreaties, are of this kind. Those who obsequiously seek residual blessings and flatter through prayers to uncanny forces, vainly beseeching illusory fortune, are of this kind. Those who sink into confusion and disorder, lost in drunkenness and infatuated with lust, losing all sense of propriety, are of this kind. Those who are avaricious and obstinate, their greed for ill-gotten wealth rooted in overbearing qi, are of this kind.

Those who act without righteousness, harming others for personal gain, are of this kind. Those who lack benevolence, oppressing beings and bullying others, are of this kind. Those who are disloyal, cunning and failing to devote themselves wholeheartedly, are of this kind. Those who are unfilial, deceiving their kin and undermining teachings, are of this kind.

According to the *Lingbao Hunyuan Jiuku Jing*, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning states: "I observe the sinful souls in the nether realms—those who, from kalpas past to the present, while living as humans, committed myriad transgressions. They failed to reflect upon their fundamental origins, were gluttonous and envious, secretly harmed others while seeking ease for themselves, contended over wealth and qi, indulged in wine and lust, depleted their spirit and dissipated their primordial truth. They were unfilial to their elders, disloyal to their lords, bullied the humble, and treated others with arrogance. Having committed a thousand kinds of sins, they are seized by the Heavenly Officials, their souls pursued by the Star Lords, and sent down to the Nine Dark Realms to endure suffering. Those with lighter offenses are reborn into the Six Paths; those with heavier sins remain imprisoned forever. Even if they regain human form, how can they attain blessings and fortune?

Now, the Six Heavenly Demon Kings and the Five Bureau Plague Offices, disregarding rank, unjustly inflict harm—whether old or young, female or male—cutting short lives before their allotted years, forcing them to depart the world prematurely. Though their deaths were not fated, their souls are left solitary, their resentment surging upward, coiled and unrelenting. Such violent and untimely deaths are truly pitiable."

According to the *Dongyuan Jing*: "In the northern lands of the human realm lies Mount Fengdu, beside the great cavern of the Water Palace, where six palaces stand in array, known as the Six Heavens. They are ruled by the Six Great Demon Kings, the outer Six Bureaus of the Supreme Yin Heavenly Lord. The minor officials of these Six Bureaus number three hundred and sixty thousand, each of grotesque and fearsome form, their bodies forged from the qi of violence and rebellion, roaming the vastness of the void. If a person’s thoughts remain upright and pure, reciting the names of these Six Palaces with reverence, the Six Heavens shall open benevolently, the Demon Kings shall protect and advocate for them, their sins erased, and they shall rely upon this for life and death, gaining boundless fortune. But if a person harbors a single impure desire, the Six Heavens shall open malevolently, and according to the severity of their transgressions, they shall be afflicted with the Six Pains and Five Plagues as retribution."

The First Heaven: *Zhoujue Yin Dong Xiuming Zongyin Dong Yin Gong*, which oversees the penal records and nether prisons of Fengdu, meting out the sins committed in past lives, causing people in this world to squander and dissipate their resources.

The Second Heaven: *Taisha Liangshi Dong Yuan Si Zhong Zheng Si Ling Gong*, which gathers the wandering, violent, and reckless souls of the world, causing people’s fortunes to stagnate and their official ranks and titles to decline.

The Third Heaven: *Mingchen Naifan Wucheng Dong Tong Xian Sheng Ling Xi Wan Gong*, which seizes the blessings and fortunes of the world, where the souls of both sages and commoners, upon departing this life, first pass through this cavern to be processed.

The Fourth Heaven: *Tianzhao Zuiqi Dong Zhengzhen Shaoling Wan Si Gong*, which governs plagues, deaths, disasters, fires, and malevolent spirits, eroding people’s fields and dwellings, draining their yin and extinguishing their yang, bringing forth disputes and official misfortunes.

The Fifth Heaven: *Zongling Qifei Dong Yunyu Yujiming Yuan Gong*, which presides over familial discord, marital strife, separation, and the affairs of widowers and widows.

The Sixth Heaven: *Gansi Lianwan Lü Dong Chongling Chiming Yunqu Gong*, which destroys the male and female offspring of the world, including those conceived in the womb, severing both mother and child, disrupting the succession of heirs.

As for the Five Bureaus, they are the mountain bureaus of the Five Peaks, each establishing plague offices. According to the *Zhengyi Zhuan*: "The plague gods of the Five Bureaus are endowed with the unbalanced qi of the Five Phases, manifesting in countless numbers to roam the human realm, exhaling poison and howling calamity. When they travel east, they are called Demon Kings; when west, Heterodox Ways; when south, Ghost Commanders; when north, Ghost Kings; and within the Central Realm, Plague Gods."

The Eastern Peak, Mount Tai, is governed by the Heavenly Equal Benevolent Sage Emperor, who oversees miscellaneous illnesses through Liu Yuanda. The Southern Peak, Mount Heng, is governed by the Celestial Bright Sage Emperor, who oversees plagues through Zhang Yuanbo. The Western Peak, Mount Hua, is governed by the Metal Heavenly Compliant Sage Emperor, who oversees dysentery through Zhao Gongming. The Northern Peak, Mount Heng, is governed by the Peaceful Heavenly Primordial Sage Emperor, who oversees violent sweats and malarial chills through Shi Wenye. The Central Peak, Mount Song, is governed by the Central Heavenly Revered Sage Emperor, who administers illnesses through four bureaus: Li Gongshen for madness and red-eyed specters; Zhong Shiji for swellings and sores; Fan Zhongqing for emaciation and atrophy; and Yao Gongbo for insanity and the Five Poisons.

Each dispatches plague soldiers, altering their forms with the four seasons. In spring, they follow the clamor of birds to record human curses. In summer, they feign death to visit families, stirring calamity among kin. In autumn, they attach themselves to the Five Earth Lords, becoming hidden dragons in dwellings. In winter, they lurk in the tombs of the Five Clans, intercepting ancestral qi to attack and consume.

The *Zhengyi Zhuan* states: "The various plague bureaus gather the yin ghosts and spirit horses from village shrines, numbering in the tens of thousands, roaming the Nine Provinces, commandeering funeral carts and corpses. They lie in wait for human errors, spreading poisonous qi to slay the old and young, male and female, cutting short lives before their allotted years, forcing them to die prematurely. All such cases are recorded by the Three Officials in the Right Bureau, preventing rebirth. Thus, their souls drift without refuge, their grievances accumulating, their resentment dense and unyielding."

The Primordial Beginning, together with the assembled sages and perfected beings, beholding this evil, how could they not grieve for the lives ensnared by kalpic fate?

The *Beidi Jing* states: "At the end of the kalpa, the true qi of the Three Heavens gradually wanes, while the perverse qi of the Six Caverns surges forth, causing humans and ghosts to become indistinguishable, right and wrong to blur. The qi of imprisoned darkness emerges, arising from the One and spreading from the north. From one, two are born—the qi of sorrow and anguish intertwines. From two, three arise—the qi of demonic delusion entangles. Then four are formed—the qi of licentiousness and depravity seeps in, wantonly flowing into human meridians, attacking the heart and assaulting the kidneys, damaging the lungs and withering the liver. The spleen and stomach become clouded with yellow, while primordial yang and the black and white aspects turn against each other. Thus, the Six Heavenly Demon Kings seize the opportunity to invade, and the Eight Bureau Plague Offices rampage, spreading poison without restraint. Only those who cultivate goodness shall, in form and fate, avoid falling into the calamities of the kalpic realm."

The *Most High’s Exalted Scripture of the Divine Incantations of the Primordial Transmission of the Great Sage True Warrior of the Mysterious Heaven, Scroll Five* concludes.
The *Most High’s Exalted Scripture of the Divine Incantations of the Primordial Transmission of the Great Sage True Warrior of the Mysterious Heaven, Scroll Six* begins.
Compiled and annotated by Chen You of the *Record of the Inner Teachings of Ascending the Mysteries* by Fang Tianzi Pei of the Marketplace.

The Perfected of Wondrous Conduct addressed the Primordial Beginning on high: "The host of Perfected Ones pity the multitude of beings—by what means may they be delivered?"
The Perfected of Wondrous Conduct inquired of the Purple Tenuity: "Pitying the affairs of this time, by what divine power did the host of Perfected Ones before the Primordial Beginning resolve them?"
The Heavenly Worthy then struck his teeth once, and a radiance streamed ten thousand leagues to the north, summoning the Great Mysterious General to sever and slay the host of demons and deliver the multitudes.
The Great Emperor affirmed in response: "The Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy, taking pity on the ten thousand kinds in the kalpic convergence of life and death, deemed it urgent to sever and slay the host of demons and deliver the multitudes. Thus he struck his teeth once."
This is called the Dao emitting one qi to engender the ten thousand things.
"Radiance streaming ten thousand leagues" refers to the celestial light issuing forth to establish and secure its majestic power.
The affairs of the north pertain to the Purple Tenuity of the Northern Culmen, who upholds and executes the mandate of the kalpic destiny.
Only by summoning the Great Mysterious General to ascend and attend the Jade Clarity, heeding the Primordial Beginning’s decree to execute and purge the demonic miasma, could the one be set in motion to perfect the ten thousand assemblies.
The Perfected One said: "I do not yet understand—by what cause does this general hold dominion over the north, his might subduing the ghosts below and sweeping away the demonic miasma?"
The Perfected of Wondrous Conduct had not yet fully grasped this, and so again inquired whether the Great Mysterious General truly possessed the power to subdue the demonic hordes below.
The Great Emperor replied: "Before this spirit unfolded the workings of creation, he first discerned the numinous. Assuming names and titles, he delivered beings and succored creatures, neither boasting of his goodness nor vaunting his abilities. Bearing the mandate of the Jade Emperor, he was enfeoffed as the Dark Warrior."
The Great Emperor, having heard the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct’s earnest inquiry, thus recounted the fundamental origins of the Dao.
In the time before the Great Simplicity was divided, when heaven and earth were merged in form, the sun and moon obscured their brilliance, and the eight trigrams concealed their spirit—this was the era before creation unfolded.
The original qi of the Dark Emperor was already within it.
Thus it is said he first received the numinous.
For a detailed annotation, see the passage on the eighty-second transformation into the Dark Warrior in the preceding section of this scripture.
Knowing to assume names and titles, he responded to the transformations of the lower realm, delivering beings and succoring creatures.
Thus, whenever the Dark Emperor manifested in the world, he advanced the teachings and doctrines, universally aiding living beings, broadly bestowing benefits upon life, practicing the Dao among humankind without self-aggrandizement, accumulating sagely merits without self-conceit—such was the enduring nature of the Dao.
According to the *Jade Calendar of the Primordial Cavern*, the Western Florescence Emperor Lord said: "Of old, the ren and gui were apportioned within the Great Clarity, establishing the image of the secondary kalpa and circulating through the Water Bureau as its source.
Water is the highest good yet does not claim goodness for itself, thus it attains unity with heaven and earth and endures, benefiting the ten thousand things without seeking benefit for itself, flowing through the ten thousand things without seeking passage for itself. The ten thousand things, benighted and obstructed, stained and attached, are cleansed without exception—this is called possessing the vast dharma of the multitude."
If one discusses the Dao of cultivation and compares it to the initial progress of a learner, its perfection may swiftly be achieved.
Only the Dark Emperor, in his youth, wielded the numinous with efficacy in the ren and gui, his merits moving the Three Heavens. From the day of his ascension, he was commissioned as the Great Mysterious Marshal.
He was further able to pacify heaven and earth, and by the grace of the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, he was enfeoffed as the Great General Dark Warrior.
The Perfected One said: "How may this general be dispatched to the lower realm to universally deliver the multitudes, sparing them from untimely death, liberating the deceased, and ensuring the living enjoy peace and well-being?"
The Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, having inquired in sequence, asked how the striking of teeth in the Golden Portal and the streaming radiance served as command.
Would this scripture, upon reaching the realm of calamity, serve to punish and pacify?
The Heavenly Worthy summoned him with a flying talisman.
The Purple Tenuity Great Emperor responded with the above words.
The Primordial Beginning issued the decree, which was called the "Flying and Soaring Esoteric Edict."
Its text is the "Divine Incantation to Subdue the Heavenly Demons" within this scripture, comprising its words and meaning.
Whenever one recites this incantation, the moment its sound is uttered, it summons the Dark Emperor with great fidelity—this is called the "Method of Swift Summoning."
Upon receiving the decree, the Dark Warrior, General Xuanwu, led his divine troops to the cinnabar steps of the Never-Night Palace.
The cinnabar steps refer to the palace terrace; the Dark Emperor, bearing the decree, proceeded to the Eight Radiant Gate of the Grand Empyrean.
The *Red Writ of the Chaotic Cavern* states: "The qi of the nine lights coalesced to form the Nine Empyreans of the Never-Night Heaven."
He beheld the Great Dao of the mighty name.
Laozi said: "I know not its name; I style it the Dao, and by force call it Great." Thus the Primordial Beginning is titled the Great Dao.
He bowed, knelt, and prostrated, then advanced to speak: "By what cause today do I receive this talisman and special decree? Fortunate to behold your compassionate countenance, what is the wondrous intent? I refine and subdue the terrace, humbly receiving the command."
At that time, the Dark Warrior, in audience, bowed his head and listened with reverence, obeying the decree.
The *Veritable Record of the Descended Brush* states: "The Primordial Beginning expounded the Dharma in the Jade Clarity’s sacred realm. The gates of heaven trembled open, and below, baleful qi surged and clashed, suffusing the celestial light. Thereupon, he commanded the Jade Emperor to issue a decree, instructing the Purple Tenuity of the Northern Culmen, the Purple Tenuity Great Emperor, to swiftly depart the Eight Radiant Throne and promptly obey the Vast Heaven’s edict. The Jade Tablet bore the command, and all were seated, saying: 'In yang, it was by encircling King Wu’s punitive expedition against Zhou that the altars of the state were pacified; in yin, it was by dispatching the Dark Warrior to subdue demons that humans and ghosts were separated.'
The Heavenly Worthy proclaimed: 'I observe the grievous qi of the lower realm surging to heaven; the great assembly is alarmed, and the lofty Perfected compete in pity. You shall go there—I esteem this.'
The Dark Warrior thereupon received the command."
The Great Emperor echoed the Jade Sound of the Primordial Beginning.
According to the *Jade Calendar of the Primordial Cavern*: "By the end of the Five Emperors’ era, in the two kalpas of Heavenly Dragon and Han above and the gradual subsiding of the great flood below, the people began to till the soil, and living beings first had sufficient clothing and food. It was then that King Zhou of Yin ruled the world, his licentious heart losing the Dao, deceiving and defying Heaven on high. Daily he committed transgressions, his malevolence and poison rampant. Thus the Six Heavenly Demon Kings were provoked, leading the host of ghosts to perpetrate every calamity, harming the innocent without restraint. Grievous qi coiled and congealed, surging upward to the Grand Empyrean."

The host of sacred perfected and lofty immortals before the Numinous Treasure Dao were all alarmed, moved to compassion and pondering how to deliver this karmic world.

As all beheld the arrival of the Great Mystery Dark Warrior, bearing the sacred command, the Primordial Beginning Most High soothed and instructed: "The Great Dao ought to have its entrusted agent—how I revere this!" Thereupon, the Celestial Court bestowed upon him golden armor, a dark robe, a black banner, and a dark standard, dispatching him by decree to the lower realm to subdue the demons.

Taking leave of Heaven, he turned his radiance back in reflection, unbound his hair and went barefoot, treading upon the tortoise and serpent. The Great Mystery Marshal, bearing the talisman of the Water Emperor, purified the turbid and subdued the perverse.

According to the *Scripture of Responding to the Kalpa*: "In later ages, when demonic influences flourished and extravagant cults arose, the paths of evil daily grew and monthly waxed. Thus the host of perfected ones grieved in pity, for living beings, sunk in delusion and chaos, no longer beheld the Primordial Beginning but turned their thoughts to heterodox currents, abandoning the true teaching." The Great Mystery, obeying the command, untangled bonds and loosed fetters, bestowing wisdom upon the myriad things and serving as a bridge for all, universally guiding them to perceive the Dao. This was called *Turning the Light Back in Reflection to the Upper Prime*.

As recorded in the *Veritable Record of Descended Brushstrokes*, the Most High commanded the Dark Warrior: "You shall go forth with unbound hair and bare feet, treading upon the tortoise and serpent. Your divine retinue shall surge forth like thunder, with heavenly soldiers as your escort." In an instant, he traversed the cosmos, suppressing the cruel and venomous demons, capturing the wanton and rampant pestilences. In the realm of hidden souls, sufferings and ailments were dispelled; humans and ghosts were parted, grievances dissolved. The common people lived in peace, and the land was purified.

The *Record of Divine Manifestations* states: "The demonic hosts encamped and spread across the northeastern wilderness near Mount E, within the ghostly realm." According to the *Veritable Record of Descended Brushstrokes*, the Great Mystery Marshal battled the Six Heavenly Demon Kings in the wilds of the Cavernous Yin. At that time, the Demon Kings transformed the *qi* of Kan and Li into a verdant tortoise and a colossal serpent, which had only just taken form when the Marshal, by divine power, subdued them beneath his feet. The ghostly multitudes were bound in the Great Cavern of Fengdu, and the people at last found peace as the universe was purified.

The *Scripture of Great Peace* records: "The Perfected Lord received the talismanic command, the divine radiance, and the precious scripture from the Primordial Beginning, leading the heavenly soldiers to capture the Demon Kings of the Celestial Pass and Earthly Axis. Suddenly, they appeared as a colossal green-black tortoise, its form shifting five times, and as a serpent of ten thousand *zhang*, its form shifting thrice. The Perfected Lord soared into the sky, pacing the *qian* and treading the Dipper, transforming into a body of a thousand *zhang*. Wielding his sword, he shattered the two demons’ forms: the tortoise shrank to the size of a fist, five *cun* in length, and the serpent to the length of a whip, three *chi*. United, they were trodden beneath the Perfected Lord’s feet."

The transformations of the two demons are here revealed:
The green-black tortoise first transformed, its color like golden light, its shell seams dark green;
Second, its color like jasper, its shell seams suffused with gold;
Third, its color like dark yellow, its shell patterns gleaming green;
Fourth, its color like deep green, its shell seams suffused with silver;
Fifth, its head became that of a dragon, its body that of a giant turtle, emitting purple-golden light, its shell inlaid with jasper.

The colossal serpent first transformed, its form like gold, its scales like cinnabar;
Next, its body appeared in azure-green, its scales woven with golden threads;
Finally, its head resembled a dragon of lapis lazuli, its body dark yellow, its scales interspersed with gold and jade.

The *Sutra of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable on the Perfected Warrior* states: "Leading the Six Ding, Six Jia, Five Thunders, and Eight Mighties, he descended to the lower realm. Within seven days, all the world’s demons were captured and severed, humans and ghosts parted, households dissolved of their bonds."

The *Book of Documents* records: "On the *wu-wu* day, King Wu crossed the Meng Ford; on the *jia-zi* day, he shattered the capital of Zhaoge. Within seven days, he overthrew the Shang, executed Zhou, pacified the altars of soil and grain, dispersed the wealth of Lutai, and distributed the grain of Juqiao. Only then did the common people of the world attain peace." Thus, the land was purified and at peace, all owing to the governance of the Central Heaven’s Purple Tenuity, the Celestial Official Great Emperor, who by decree secretly administered its rise and fall.

The Dark Warrior again beheld the Heavenly Venerable and recounted the power of the Dao, the completion of his task, and the descent of the turbid and ascent of the pure. Having accomplished his righteous war and benevolent punitive campaign, the Dark Emperor again ascended to the Jade Purity to report to the Primordial Beginning. Returning in auspicious radiance, he resumed his original position.

The *Record of Descended Brushstrokes* states: "The Dark Emperor triumphantly returned to the Pure Capital and faced the Golden Portal." The Primordial Beginning declared: "Before the Great Beginning of the Prior Heaven, you were originally the transformation of the Five Numinous Ones of the North, the Dark Elder of the Great Yin, the Celestial One of Purple *Qi*—the root of the ten thousand images. Having passed through two thousand five hundred years, you now return to your original direction, resuming your root and position." Thereupon, the Primordial Beginning commanded the Jade Emperor to issue a jade decree, appointing him to the office of the Right Victorious Mansion of the Northern Culmen. On the Zhongyuan Festival of that year, the decree and treasure were proclaimed in the Purple Tenuity Hall.

The Wondrous Practitioner thus learned of the Purple Prime Lord’s transmission of the Dark Emperor’s method: *Exchanging Qian and Spreading the Dipper*.

*Exchanging Qian and Spreading the Dipper* was the Dark Emperor’s original practice. As the Perfected Scribe of the Purple Tenuity Gallery, when propagating the true teaching, "exchanging *qian*" refers to renewing the virtue of the sun, while "spreading the Dipper" refers to practicing the Way of the Central Culmen. Thus, virtue and the Way subdue all without deliberation.

According to the *Comprehensive Tortoise Collection of Master Du*: "The Supreme Lord’s second dispatch sent the Dark Barbarian and Azure Water Envoy to bestow it upon King Yu of the Si clan. Having received it, Yu labored diligently for his state and exerted himself for the world in matters of irrigation." Yang Xiong’s *Model Sayings* states: "In ancient times, the Si clan governed the waters and soil, and the shamans emulated Yu. Today’s Daoist arts thus first bear the name *Yu’s Step*." Therefore, the methods of the former sages are not the reckless and deceitful practices of today’s shamans and spirit-mediums. Even slight transgressions invite heavenly punishment, as detailed in the ritual protocols at the beginning of the scriptures.

*Stimulating Kun and Pointing the Mainstay* aids the Celestial Pass above.
*Stimulating Kun and Pointing the Mainstay* is also called the method of *Treading the Earth’s Threads and Flying the Heavenly Net*. It unites the power of creation and destruction, activates the mechanism of the Celestial Pass’s revolutions, and manifests the guidance of the Dao. By applying virtue, one attains it. Thus, in great matters, it purifies the cosmos; in small matters, it protects and shelters the myriad people.

In ancient times, from the Middle Antiquity onward, King Yu upheld and practiced the teachings, thereby subduing and taming the fierce flood-dragons, savage beasts, demons, specters, malevolent spirits, and all manner of venomous creatures—expelling them to the farthest reaches. Thereafter, he dredged the rivers and streams, guiding their currents to flow into the Four Seas, so that the people of the world might each dwell securely in their homes.

*Stimulating Kun* is the method of *Treading the Earth’s Threads*. One treads forward and backward in three revolutions, making nine steps in total, thus forming the primordial altar and ritual mat, embodying the capacity of the Kun’s virtue to bear all things. One must recite the altar-founding incantation with reverence, and the spirits will heed the call without fail. The incantation reads:

*"The Qian’s honored radiance shines,
The Kun’s compliance inwardly aligns.
The Two Modes harmonize in peace,
The Six Directions thrive in purity.
Heaven’s match, Earth’s embrace,
Eternal tranquility and clarity.
Resonating with the Primordial Sovereign,
Above the robe, below the skirt.
Zhen ascends, Gen arises,
Kan flows, Li illumines.
Xun governs, Dui brings forth life.
Vacuous steps, dragon’s majesty,
Heaven’s Gate, Earth’s Portal,
Man’s Door, Ghost’s Path—
Who guards me? The August Heaven’s Luminous Lord.
Today’s Yu’s Step,
Aligns with the Celestial Mainstay above.
Ghosts and spirits submit in reverence,
Banishing all inauspiciousness below.
Desires fulfilled as wished,
Manifesting timely numinous radiance.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Supreme Decree commands!"*

*Pointing the Mainstay* is the method of *Flying the Heavenly Net*. Standing at the center of the altar, one traces the joints of the fingers with the left and right hands, extending to the five Dipper’s deviant positions, then flicks and exhales qi to ascend, emulating the revolving jade mechanism and the flowering canopy that shelters all. The mudra is formed with the left hand, all five fingernails concealed—termed the *Seal of the Great Law Lord of All Heavens*. The right hand holds the sword level, reciting incantations toward each direction and consecrating water to spray. The incantation reads:

*"I bathe my body in the moon,
Refine my essence in the sun.
Sun and moon assist my form,
The twenty-eight constellations unite with me.
A thousand calamities, ten thousand misfortunes—dispelled,
My water is pure.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Supreme Decree commands!"*

Upon reciting the incantation to the word *"consecrate,"* one brandishes the sword toward the high ground in the southeast, orally drawing in the numinous qi of the Jade Clarity of Divine Empyrean, and visualizes it. Then, one sips the pure water from the vessel and sprays it forth.

Once the altar is established, one must still guard against malevolent forces, lest defilement or corruption taint the ritual master’s garments. According to celestial statutes, punitive measures are to be enacted as follows:

The *Grotto-Heaven Blade Branch* and *Earth-Core Blade Branch* dispel evil;
The *Human Blade Branch*, *Metal Blade Branch*, *Wood Blade Branch*, *Water Blade Branch*, *Fire Blade Branch*, and *Earth Blade Branch* vanquish bandits and raiders.
The *Blade Branch* severs plague demons,
The *Blade Branch* slays flood-dragons,
The *Blade Branch* subdues the Seven Demons,
Executes the Two Ghosts,
The *Blade Branch* shatters the Five Sufferings, Eight Adversities, and Nine Calamities,
Eradicates the hundred diseases.
If evil persons seek to harm, one presses the third joint of the left little finger to subdue and vanquish their malice, causing the perpetrator to suffer misfortune. Pressing the third joint of the right little finger grants them life and releases them. This is called the *Dispelling Evil Blade Branch Method*.

Further scriptural instructions exist but are not fully recorded here. This is indeed the ladder to profound mysteries and the gateway to primordial truth. Should a practitioner of steadfast intent officiate at the altar and encounter any malevolent, anomalous, or inauspicious entities, it is fitting to show mercy once. However, one must not rashly establish this altar or carelessly execute the slaughter of spirits, lest the ritual master’s hidden virtue be diminished.

The *Yu’s Step* here recorded must not be casually transmitted to the uninitiated. As they remain unenlightened, it is presented for the benefit of beginners whose names have not yet been registered in the celestial rolls through proper ordination. Those who have not received transmission from a master must not presume to practice it.

The incantation further states:

This incantation is the great divine mantra of the Dark Emperor’s original deeds. When recited, it establishes the nine-step net’s boundary within the demonic camp, aiding the Celestial Pass above, flying to enshroud the Six Directions and Eight Extremities, and seizing control of victory. Reciting this mantra once, its authority prevails mightily. Within seven days, the myriad demons of the Six Heavens are fully subdued.

In the *Great Beginning* and *Great Simplicity*,
The *Great Beginning* was a vast expanse, nameless and formless.
At the inception of the *Great Simplicity*, there was yet no shape.
No image, no form—
The Dao is originally imageless,
Merging with spontaneity.
Virtue is originally formless,
Establishing the primordial root.
None knew the heavy and turbid,
Its bounds untransformed,
Its measure unknown.
The heavy and turbid congealed and settled,
Who could discern the light and pure?
Encompassing yet undivided,
Its compass unknowable.
The light and pure ascended and clarified,
Accumulating yang to form Heaven.

I, within the primordial chaos—
The Dark Emperor, distinct and resolute,
Preceding Heaven and Earth in the chaos,
Transformed images and divided auspices.
Separating darkness and light—
The *Xu* and *Wei* constellations’ luster,
The true essence of *Kan* and *Li*,
Assisting the sun and moon,
Dividing darkness and light.
Heaven attained its vigor,
Heaven received the One qi,
Qian’s strength shone forth,
Crystalline and resplendent,
Weaving day and night.
Earth attained its tranquility,
Earth received the One qi,
Kun’s compliance bore all,
Firm and utterly still,
Sustaining the boundless.
The people attained sustenance,
Humanity embraced the One,
Endowed with harmonious balance,
Few desires, little selfishness,
Their years and kalpas multiplied.
All things attained sprouting,
The myriad things never exhausted,
Burgeoning from the One,
Their origins inexhaustible,
Interacting and flowing.
Evil attained rectification,
The yin and the myriad杂,
Their kinds diverse,
The Great Mystery’s One rectifies all.
Spirits attained numinosity,
Spiritual clarity received the One,
Transforming naturally,
Luminous and expansive,
Illuminating boundlessly.
Within the Three Powers,
Heaven and Earth unite as One,
The primordial qi is formless,
Humans attain primordial awareness,
Penetrating inner illumination.
The myriad kinds flourish,
The lord of the state receives the One,
All people prosper,
Insects and plants,
Each fulfills its life.
The Great Dao dispersed,
The Dao preceded the Supreme Ultimate,
The root of Heaven and Earth,
Scattering into the myriad things,
All relying on its generation.
Benevolence and righteousness arose,
Heaven’s virtue, great virtue,
Yin and yang, soft and hard,
Now termed *punishment* and *virtue*,
Initiating their application and concealment.

Rites and music having arisen,
The Three Canons and Five Rites
Ordered human relations with restraint.
Music’s systems established,
Nine transformations revealed purity.
Yet perversity and deceit spread,
Externally exhausted, internally decayed—
Abandoning rites, forsaking music,
Violence, insolence, and treachery
Arose in reckless profusion.
The Six Principles were lost,
Ruler and minister confounded,
Father and son disordered,
Husband and wife estranged—
The Six Principles wholly undone.
The Four Peoples contended.
The Four Occupations honored scholars,
Then farmers, artisans, merchants,
Each failing to master their craft,
Vying in envy and boastful strength.
Above, no magnanimity:
King Zhou’s tyranny and cruelty,
The Dao diminished, laws collapsed,
No lenience shown,
The state imperiled, its borders forgotten.
Below, no loyalty:
Flattering lords, exalting tigers,
Favorites and ministers expanded,
Punishments multiplied—roasting and branding—
Chaos reigned, no fidelity remained.
Some became demons, some ghosts:
Six afflictions brought punishment,
Deluded spirits and plague ghosts emerged,
Calamity struck everywhere,
Unrelenting misfortune endured.
Some became specters, some spirits:
Heaven’s disasters, earth’s harms,
Omens appeared, baleful vapors arose,
The hundred grains failed to ripen,
Legacy plagues became epidemics.
Indulging in cruelty and poison,
People grew vicious and overbearing,
Feeding on bitterness, gratifying desires,
Burying curses, glutting on victory,
Shortening human lifespans.
Disturbing the lives of the people:
Heretical ways and demonic arts,
Wandering malevolence, erupting curses,
Disrupting the people’s lives,
Extorting illicit gains.
Entire households afflicted:
Dark schemes and mutual harm,
Retribution met with execution,
Bodies tainted by accumulated evil,
Whole families stricken.
Years of penal suffering:
Years and months accumulated,
Renouncing benevolence and righteousness,
Loyalty and filial piety wholly abandoned,
Condemned by yin, judged by yang.
Wealth and possessions dissipated:
Nameless riches,
How long could they fill the house?
Suddenly scattered,
Descendants could not preserve them.
Kin left solitary:
Blood ties and flesh,
Who would willingly sever them?
Alone, like birds
Temporarily flocking.
Lives cut short in vain:
Lives lightly cast away,
Through self-inflicted transgressions,
After death,
Falling into demonic realms.
Disasters and misfortunes entwined:
Three disasters, six harms,
How could they wrongly entangle you?
Punishment descends upon you,
Sins filling to the brim.
Foul and impure qi:
Mutually harming living things,
Fattening the belly—
How could one know the essence of filth?
Obscuring the Three Luminaries,
Ascending to the Celestial Court.
The kalpa’s end neared,
All evils mutually punished,
Seven cries of curses,
Exhaled to reach the Celestial Court.
The Heavenly Honored One issued a decree:
The Primordial Beginning, in compassionate creation,
Opened the gate of vast expedience,
And commanded the Dark Emperor
To universally save all beings.
Let us attain peace:
The Dark Emperor, by edict,
Bestowed universal blessings upon living beings,
The Three Origins’ men and women
All gathered in tranquility.
All specters shall be eradicated:
If any spirits or demons
Erupt untimely in pestilence,
Defying his command,
They shall be seized and cut down.
No ghost shall escape boiling:
Nameless ghostly entities,
Daring to rise in ferocity,
Inciting calamity, demanding sacrifices,
Shall be hunted and cooked.
The officials of epidemics:
The Eight Divisions and Five Pestilences,
Who oversee the wicked,
Shall not permit the spread of poison
To harm the innocent.
Bound and submissive:
Those who dare disobey
Shall be allowed to display their ferocity,
Seized, bound, and shackled,
Beaten and flogged.
Ghosts and spirits annihilated:
Manifestations of gods and ghosts,
Daring to act with ferocity,
Harboring malevolent spirits,
Shall be uniformly exterminated.
Evil demons overthrown:
Demons guarding ghostly posts,
Consorting with perversity—unacceptable.
The Supreme Mystery shall know all,
Offenders shall be toppled.
I command ten billion valiant warriors:
The Supreme Mystery’s marshals lead heroic legions,
Rain Masters, Wind Lords,
Lightning Mothers, Thunder Lords,
Generals Jia and Geng,
The Eight Slayers, Celestial Stems,
The Six Jia Great Spirits,
Earth Rulers, City Gods.
Fifty million troops:
The Supreme Mystery holds office,
Overseeing all camps,
Commanding the armies,
Fifty million soldiers.
Heaven above, earth below:
Soaring through heaven, overturning earth,
Protecting the common people,
Governing within and without,
Subduing demons, controlling spirits.
Following my ascent and descent:
Waving banners, drumming in procession,
Rising and falling without cease,
Protecting heaven, aiding earth,
Extending grace to humanity.
Those who resist me shall perish:
There is King Gun,
Who defied the Dark Emperor’s sacred decree—
Instantly destroyed.

King Gun embarked on his official career, indulging in delicacies of milk, turtle, and eel. At every post he held, he demanded his subordinates procure these creatures to sate his cravings. His wife and children, who revered the incense and flame of True Warrior, often urged him to abstain from such fare, but Gun paid no heed.

One day, appointed as Commissioner of the Imperial Carriage Bureau to govern Xingzhou, he journeyed alone to his post. Suddenly, he was stricken with agonizing heart pain, groaning day and night, helpless against the torment. He heard voices calling for his life, and a host of turtles and eels swarmed to gnaw at his flesh. Then, a disheveled divine figure arrived, wielding a sword to drive them away. Gun revived unharmed, realizing it was True Warrior who had saved him. Upon completing his term and returning home, he commissioned the transcription of a full canon of scriptures, which he donated to Yanfu Abbey in gratitude to the celestial court.

Soon after, he received an imperial summons to serve as Vice Chancellor of the Directorate of Education. Boarding a boat to the capital, he encountered a Daoist on the banks of the Bian River, who read his fortune and said: "You shall surely be appointed Compiler-in-Chief upon arrival, but I fear you will also be assigned to oversee the affairs of the *geng* and *xin* directions. You must decline this post, or else both your lifespan and fortune will be cut short—you will starve to death in the snow, your bones left unburied." Enraged, Gun rebuked the diviner, who vanished in an instant.

Upon reaching the capital, Gun was indeed granted the title of Imperial Censor and Academician of the Tianzhang Pavilion. He was then dispatched to the Western Regions, where his critical remarks toward the Tibetan ruler Li Wanquan brought humiliation upon the state. Fearing punishment under his own country’s laws, he fled at the border, enticing his attendants to join him in Yangshan. There, a relentless snowstorm trapped them beneath a rocky overhang, where they languished without fire or food.

Suddenly, True Warrior descended from the heavens, rebuking him: "Gun, you spurned my warning on the banks of the Bian. What now?" Gun, realizing his folly, could only repent too late. Gradually, he wasted away in darkness, starving to death.

Those who heed me shall live:
Take Sun Cheng, who faithfully served the Dark Emperor. Even at death’s door, he was restored to life.

Sun Cheng, a Vice Minister of Justice temporarily assigned as Hanlin Academician and Reader-in-Waiting, was appointed imperial envoy to the Western Regions. While passing through the road to Fengxiang, a commoner approached him and said: "Are you not bound as envoy to the Western Tibetans? This mission is not fated for your destiny. If you proceed, you will face peril, and many will suffer with you. To escape calamity, you must fervently invoke the name of my master, True Warrior, and you shall attain the full measure of your heavenly allotted lifespan."

"I, too, once served the state," the man continued, "but now I hold the immortal office of overseeing the affairs of the Three Luo Mountains, Jade Peak, the Jasper Flask Grotto, and the Dragon Pool. I am Zhong Jinming, and I came especially to warn you." With that, he vanished.

Upon reflection, Sun Chengzhi proceeded to the western frontier and attended a banquet hosted by the Tibetan ruler Li Xijing. By chance, a poetic prompt was presented: *"The sun and moon rise in the east and set in the west"*—a seven-character line. Chengzhi found himself unable to compose a matching verse, enraging the ruler, who ordered him bound and imprisoned. Overcome with terror and humiliation, fearing disgrace to the state, he returned to the court only to face execution.

In his moment of utmost dread, Chengzhi recited the sacred name of True Warrior several times. Soon after, a memorandum from the Chancellery and the Secretariat arrived in haste, stating: *"Sun Chengzhi merits execution. However, considering his prior encounter with the divine messenger Zhong Jinming, who foretold the outcome of his mission, it is evident that the state should not recklessly impose such a severe penalty. By imperial decree, his crime is pardoned."*

A separate edict was issued to Fengxiang Prefecture, commanding the construction of a shrine hall for Zhong Jinming, where his statue was to be enshrined in the likeness of a white-robed immortal. He was canonized as *Immortal Guide of Serene Virtue* (Shandao Anji Xianjun), his glory eternally celebrated for aiding the nation. Thus, Chengzhi, through his devotion, was delivered from death and granted new life.

*"Those who revile me bring only shame upon themselves."*

Among the worldly multitude, there are many ignorant sorts who, through wickedness, offend the Mysterious Emperor. By their bodily and verbal transgressions, they invite only disgrace upon themselves. Consider the case of the rogues Feng Chongda, Gao Shaolang, and You Xinger from Zizhou. These three men formed a gang and frequented the seedy quarters of the riverside. One day, they went to the home of the diviner Lu Qian to have their fortunes told. Before the incense and the image of the True Warrior, they drew a lot, but the omen was inauspicious. They immediately hurled abuse, cursing foully as they departed.

Thereafter, in the two prefectures of Kui and Fu, a band of fierce brigands arose, plundering the wealth of wealthy households and killing the official Yang Zhujiao. The constables were unable to capture them. At the time, the Vice Minister of Justice, Zhang Shiming, was serving as Pacification Commissioner. He issued a proclamation offering rewards and called upon all manner of people to come forward with information. Within the allotted time, Lu Qian suddenly appeared to lodge a complaint, stating that the perpetrators were Feng Chongda, Gao Shaolang, and You Xinger from Zizhou. Together with the constables, he went to the side of Longxing Temple in Zizhou, where they were all apprehended. When brought to Kuifu, however, they vanished in an instant. The case of the brigands was documented and transferred to Zizhou, where Lu Qian was summoned to claim his reward. Yet Lu refused to sign the confession or submit the required documents, repeatedly insisting: *"My family has, for three generations, made a living by selling divination lots, and we have always revered the True Warrior. Though it is true that Feng Chongda and the others once came to my home to draw lots, and the omen was inauspicious, they immediately cursed the Sage and left. I never left my home to report this matter to the authorities."*

Upon reviewing the case, the commander of Kuifu examined the circumstances and memorialized the throne. The Three Departments deliberated and concluded: *"Were it not for the unseen aid of the True Warrior, how could such a band of outlaws, who harmed officials and preyed upon the people, have been captured?"* The reward, amounting to seven parts, was duly granted to Lu Qian to be used for incense and offerings in atonement. As for Feng Chongda and his accomplices, their crimes were referred to the market executioner for dismemberment. Is it not evident that those who revile and dishonor the True Warrior fail to show reverence and faith? The retribution is swift indeed.

Those who honor me shall be exalted. Consider Di Qing, whose reverence moved the Mysterious Emperor to descend in majesty and attach himself to Di’s person, aiding him in attaining glory. Di Qing, a native of Xihe in Fen Prefecture, had in his youth served as a scribe in his village. He diligently maintained the incense and offerings to the True Warrior. In the early years of the Baoyuan era, one night he encountered a spirit who bestowed upon him gold and a white robe. Hearing of the military campaign in Shaanxi, he wished to join the effort. He prayed to the True Warrior and drew a lot to determine an auspicious direction before setting out. Upon reaching Yan’an Prefecture, he presented himself to Fan Zhongyan, the Military Commissioner and Gentleman for Dispersing Orders. At first sight, Fan recognized him as an extraordinary man and appointed him as an aide. Di Qing was sent to confront the two million invading troops of Zhao Yuanhao. Through repeated battles, he achieved repeated victories, and the military commanders all hailed him as *"the Heavenly General of the North."* His fame reached the ears of the Campaign Commander, Han Qi, who memorialized the throne on Di Qing’s behalf. Subsequently, by imperial decree, Di Qing and a company of twenty-eight aides, including Liao Dao, were summoned to the capital. Each day, they were permitted to don their armor and wooden swords and perform a martial dance in the Jiade Guangzhen Hall. There, they demonstrated their equestrian formations before Emperor Renzong. Among their number, one man stood out for his radiant and imposing presence. Before his horse, a tortoise and serpent frolicked upon the ground. As Minister Song Xiang was presenting his report, the luminous figure suddenly vanished. The emperor inquired as to Di Qing’s position in the formation, and Di’s response accorded with the imperial perception. He was then appointed Commander of the Capital’s Cavalry and Infantry. He was further dispatched to pacify the western frontier. Upon hearing of his approach, Zhao Yuanhao submitted and sued for peace. When the barbarian chieftain Nong Zhigao rebelled in the two Guang provinces, Di Qing once again achieved victory. By imperial decree, he was appointed Military Affairs Commissioner, concurrently overseeing the Bureau of Military Affairs, the Court of Imperial Entertainments, and the nationwide administration of military, horse, salt, and iron affairs. He lived to the age of fifty, at which time he underwent liberation through the corpse. He was posthumously enfeoffed as Duke Wuxiang. Thus, through his lifelong devotion to the True Sage, his name shone brightly even after death.

Those who pay me ritual homage shall enjoy longevity. Consider Wu Yuansi, who, through his sincere observance of the rites to the Mysterious Emperor, was blessed with longevity for his entire family. Yuansi’s household resided in Baisha Village, Jiangdu, Yangzhou, where they farmed and lived by the plow. Each winter, they held a grand sacrifice to the Three Realms, giving thanks for the blessings and protection of the gods. One day, they happened to encounter the Daoist Tang Qingyu from Taizhou, who had come to their door to solicit alms and provisions. Observing the Wu household employing a spirit-medium and arranging the altars of the celestial bureaus, mingling the True Warrior with common deities and offering bloody sacrifices in the same manner, Tang admonished Yuansi: *"Have you not heard that the True Warrior of the Central Heaven descends each month to inspect the good and evil deeds of humanity? If you rely on spirit-mediums and offer impure sacrifices, you risk offending the celestial realm, turning blessings into calamity."*

Upon hearing this, Yuansi turned his heart toward sincere faith. He commissioned Daoist rites, reconstructing the rituals with proper solemnity. On the day of the fast, over twenty wandering Daoists arrived to attend the gathering. The Daoist Chen Boyang bowed and inquired after their origins. One among them replied: *"We have learned that a prayer assembly is being held here and have come from the realm beyond to attend."* When the feast concluded, they departed, leaving behind a black robe upon the seat. It shimmered with radiant light and emitted a wondrous fragrance. Yuansi knelt in reverence and carefully preserved it.

Thereafter, when officials were ordered to register the elderly in their jurisdictions, it was found that in the Wu household alone, eight individuals had surpassed a hundred years of age. Among them, Wu Gui had reached the age of one hundred and fourteen. His steps were light and vigorous, and he attended the imperial banquet with unimpaired sight and hearing. When the prefect Chen Suping inquired into the circumstances, he memorialized the throne accordingly. The emperor specially granted Wu Gui an official title and ordered the construction of a commemorative gate to honor his filial piety, ritual propriety, and longevity.

Those who reject me shall perish. High-ranking officials and powerful ministers who do not believe in the Mysterious Emperor, who slander his descending admonitions as false and absurd, shall be swiftly struck down by malignant illness and die. Consider Chen Zhi, a minister under the usurper Wang Yanzheng of Min. When he learned that Li Sheng, the Founding Ancestor of Southern Tang, intended to invade Min territory and had already advanced his troops to the border, he was suddenly forced to retreat. The ruler of Min, upon hearing the report, grew suspicious and dispatched Shao Kang to deliver a letter to the Southern Tang court, seeking an explanation. The Southern Tang replied: *"When I personally led my troops to the border, I saw a divine host emerging from the clouds to greet me. One among them declared: ‘I am the Local Deity of Xianyuan in the Min Mountains. By the command of the True Warrior, my Enlightened Lord, I have come to admonish Your Majesty. You must cease hostilities to secure good fortune and spare the people from suffering. Moreover, the fate of the Min ruler’s lineage is not yet exhausted. In the year Gengwu, he shall ascend to the celestial realm. Furthermore, the territory of Min is not destined to belong to Your Majesty.’"*

Upon the deity’s departure, I thus withdrew my troops.

In gratitude to the True Warrior, I performed the jiao offering and presented a memorial that very night, wherein I received a revelation concerning the "Ascent to the Celestial Realm"—this pertained to the Zhou’s fire mandate and the Southern Face Hall plaque of the Song ruler.

Upon reading the letter, the ruler of Min convened his officials to discuss peace. Only Chen Zhihan, Military Commissioner of Shaowu, vehemently opposed the proposal, insisting: *"The great enterprise of our state cannot be abandoned on the basis of empty, fantastical words. I submit that we should never seek reconciliation with the Southern Tang. Instead, let us raise our armies and punish them."*

After leaving court, Zhihan returned home. Soon after dismounting, he fell into a frenzy, shrieking that he had erred in defying the virtue of the divine void. Moments later, he collapsed, blood gushing from his seven orifices, and died an ill-omened death.

By this decree, the Dark Emperor swears:
To govern all that is to come,
The Great Mysterious Code encompasses all things.
Let humans and spirits alike heed:
Those who follow the true Way shall erase their transgressions;
Spirits shall harm none and be freed from exile, ascending in rank.
Swiftly, as the Great Mysterious Law commands!

Turn your thoughts with haste and act as bidden.
The Great Mysterious Lord of Unity,
Most divine, most refined,
Brings forth prosperity and nurtures the flowering of essence.
His law and command govern all,
Delivering sentient beings.

He holds sway over the Three Realms,
Near and far in an instant,
Recording evil, preserving good,
Restraining and seizing the wicked.
His decrees manifest clearly—
As demonstrated by recent human affairs,
And compiled in the *Memorials to the Sage-Initiator*,
All are well aware.

For those who heed or disregard the Dark Emperor’s scriptures, incantations, teachings, admonitions, and models of conduct, retribution is plainly recorded in the annals.

Moreover, the Dark Emperor’s oath—*"Let humans and spirits alike heed"*—reveals the two paths of life and death, the causes of misfortune and blessing, all under the jurisdiction of the Great Mysterious Heavenly Court.

The Great Sage of the Dark Heavens commands the divine host,
Illuminating like the sun, moon, and stars,
Transforming like thunder, lightning, wind, and rain.
On Jia and Geng days, the duty generals govern the corpse-spirits within the body.
The eight seasonal qi spirits, in their ordered sequence, oversee the good and evil of the human heart.

All is subject to the decree of the Northern Pole Emperor,
Retribution issued from the Right Victory Office.
Those who do good shall be blessed with a hundred fortunes,
Their prosperity flowing to descendants.
Those who do evil shall be cursed with a hundred calamities,
Their legacy extinguished, their line severed.

Though the foolish may delude themselves, believing they have escaped,
When the day of reckoning arrives,
They shall traverse every evil realm.
Yet the Dark Emperor, in his compassion, still grants absolution.

The *Record of the Sage-Initiator* states:
*"Wherever dwellings are afflicted by ancient tombs, towering forests, or lingering souls of the restless dead—entities that, over time, become spirits, clinging to grasses and trees, dripping blood, hurling fire and stones at gates—or where mountain and river deities, earth-shrine spirits, or those who gather in private temples, illicitly establish incense altars, or where sorcerers and mediums convene, giving rise to malevolent forces that extort offerings from households, harassing and ruining the people—let all who suffer such demonic afflictions revere the incense of the True Warrior. They shall attain true rectitude, forever subduing all demons, and welcome auspiciousness into a purified household."*

At that time, the Wondrously Practiced Perfected One—
*"At that time"* refers to the conclusion of this segment of the original transmission’s causes and conditions.

The Wondrously Practiced Perfected One, through cultivating the fundamental practices of the earth and engaging in manifold acts of guidance and enlightenment, had yet to awaken and lead forth those who sought learning.

The August Heavenly Worthy of the Void said: "Before your birth, all was chaos, undifferentiated—nothing existed. Sight and hearing could not unite with the True and Constant; without luminous signs, what could be called wondrous practice?"

He further declared: "With concentrated mind and arduous practice, sever all worldly desires. Let no deluded thoughts arise, no attachments cling. Refine spirit with qi, refine form with spirit, until both form and spirit attain subtlety. The body merges with spontaneity, gathering the myriad dharmas into one self, dispersing the one self to transform into the myriad scenes. Unbound by existence or non-existence, forever transcending birth and death—this is called a Perfected One."

Countless Flying Heavenly Deities and Lords, innumerable speakers, and the Flying Heavenly Mounted Attendants all attended the assembly at once, their numbers beyond reckoning. The Flying Heavenly Deity-Kings, appointed by the Five Elder Thearchs to their offices, oversee the heavens day and night without respite.

The *Chapter on Generating Spirit* states: "They encompass the Heavenly Immortals, harmonizing the myriad transformations, nurturing and tending to the multitudes."

The assembly of True Immortals—*The Scripture on Stabilizing Contemplation of the Numinous Treasure* says: "Those who extend their years for thousands of ages are called Immortals."

The Perfected One of True Yang said: "Immortals ascend through five ranks: ghost immortals, human immortals, earth immortals, spirit immortals, and heavenly immortals."

The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: "There are ten kinds of immortals in cultivation: earth-walking immortals, flying immortals, wandering immortals, void-walking immortals, heavenly-walking immortals, penetrating immortals, illuminating immortals, Dao-walking immortals, essence-walking immortals, and absolute-walking immortals."

Generally, those who have accrued merit in the Dao and conduct in the world, whose merit and conduct are complete, ascend to dwell in the Grotto-Heavens. There, they assume offices and are ranked among the Immortal Officials. If they further render great merit to heaven and earth and great conduct across past and present, they gradually advance through the immortal ranks, ascending through the thirty-six Grotto-Heavens and the eighty-one Yang Heavens, transcending into the realm of spontaneity and non-being—these are called True Immortals.

Upon hearing these teachings, all present leapt for joy, bowed in reverence, and extolled the merit and virtue. The secret records, inscribed on jade tablets, were sealed and presented to the Grand Pure Palace of the Supreme Ultimate when the discourse of the Great Thearch of Purple Tenuity concluded. The Starry Perfected Ones and the Immortal Assemblies all knelt to take their leave, rising together to praise the sublime virtues of the Dark Thearch. These records, vast as the jade tablets, were sealed and conveyed to the Grand Pure Palace of the Supreme Ultimate. In accordance with the Mysterious Statutes, they are transmitted to the Worthy Ones of the lower realms once every forty thousand kalpas, and have long been revered and practiced.

The Great Thearch further affirmed this scripture, saying: "Will the Most High surely entrust this to a banished immortal for transmission to the human world? Indeed, it was bestowed upon the Han dynasty’s Recluse Zhang for circulation."

Thereafter, banished immortals transmitted it to the human world, urging them to live diligently and avoid killing—such was the intent of the Most High.

"Hereafter" refers to the period from the Middle Antiquity onward. As for banished immortals, they are perfected beings punished by the Supreme Emperor, condemned to retain their forms and descend into the mortal realm. Only after receiving a special pardon from the Supreme Emperor may they ascend again. Let us recount a few examples:

Heavenly Master Zhang was banished for ten years due to his excessive severity in slaying ghosts. The Perfected Lord Xu of the Western Jin was condemned to twelve years for failing to honor his ancestors, thereby committing the crime of disobedience and regicide.

The *Household Transmission of the Han Heavenly Master* states: In the first year of Emperor Zhi’s *Benchu* reign (the *bingshu* year), the Perfected One sought to traverse and pacify the mountains. He moved to Yuntai Mountain in Guizhou, where he built a chamber. After residing there for forty-nine days, he suddenly heard celestial music resounding in the sky. Gazing upward with solemn reverence, he beheld the Most High Lord Lao leading his retinue, lingering for a long while without descending. Presently, an emissary delivered a decree: "Daoling, based on your meritorious deeds, you are fit to assume the rank of Supreme Immortal of the Nine Perfected. However, for your entry into Shu to subdue the ghostly prisoners of the netherworld, you improperly summoned wind and rain, disturbed the stars, commanded the deities, and shook the mountains and rivers. The killing aura darkened the skies, lacking the virtue of cherishing life. The Supreme Emperor has issued a decree of punishment: you shall remain in the mortal realm for now, which is why the Most High cannot draw near to you." The Perfected One listened with trepidation.

Another messenger then called out to Daoling: "The decree from the Lord of the Lower Primordial has absolved your transgressions."

The decree specially grants you the Three Eights for atonement, erasing the Black Register, and delivering the sacred writ of the Mystic Ancestor. The Perfected One bowed in acceptance, and only then did the sagely procession depart. The Perfected One then returned to reside on Mount Heming.

The *Scripture of the Southern Dipper* states: "The Most High descended for the third time, bestowing a thousand scrolls of scriptures—all essential teachings for cultivation—intending to transmit them to those of the Dao, that they might attain deliverance in this very body and abide eternally through endless kalpas."

In the second year of Yongshou during the reign of Emperor Huan, the Perfected One entrusted all categories of scriptures, registers, and seals to his eldest son, Heng, with these instructions: "Let each generation henceforth pass this to one son, and transmit it to none but our clan’s lineal descendants." Three years after Heng’s succession, in the ninth month, the Perfected One once more journeyed to Mount Yuntai and ascended at noon on the ninth day.

In the second year of Guanghe during the reign of Emperor Ling, the year *jiwei*, Heng retired to Mount Yangping in Pengzhou, where he transmitted the teachings to his eldest son, Lu. Lu later moved to Nanzheng City in Hanzhong. By the year *yiwei* during the reign of Emperor Xian, Cao Cao, the Duke of Wei, conquered the city. Lu’s younger brother, Zhang Wei, was executed, but Lu declined the offer of enfeoffment and, at the end of the Jian’an era, passed the ancestral teachings to his eldest son, Zi, who had no heir.

His younger brother, Sheng, carrying the burden of the lineage, journeyed south to the lands of Sun Quan of Wu. Arriving at the summit of Mount Long in Shangrao Prefecture, he beheld the lingering traces of the ancestral Perfected One—cinnabar caves, wells, and stoves still remained. Thereupon, he built a hut at the mountain’s foot and took up residence.

In the year *dingsi*, upon hearing that Emperor Ming of Wei had conquered Shu and that the ancestral Perfected One’s family repository had been burned, Zhao Cheng hastened back to Shu. He inherited the dharma seat from his elder cousin Zi and returned it to Sun Hao.

In the first year of Ganlu, the year *jiazi*, he established the Orthodox Unity Mystic Altar at his dwelling, transmitting the ancestral secret methods and talismans to all quarters, initiating and instructing disciples. Among the graded registers was the *Secret Record of the Supreme General of the Mystic Heavenly Perfected Warrior*, which was disseminated upon request.

Disciples of the Dao, bow your heads and uphold these teachings. Those who truly practice them shall exhort one another, and all who hear of this shall do likewise.

Following the moral teachings of this scripture, which first cultivates the five human relationships—ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife, elder and younger brothers, and friends—those who wholeheartedly embrace its faith without transgressing principle shall naturally attain a pure heart and a luminous spirit, penetrating the profound essence of the *Meng* and *Tai* hexagrams. Many have achieved manifest virtue through this path. This is indeed the ever-radiant teaching; how could it ever perish?

Yet though it suffered destruction in Wei and dispersal in the Western Jin, there remained reclusive adepts who preserved its truths. Through transmission and transcription into multiple versions, each with its own lineage of transmission, the origins of the Perfected Warrior’s cause are recounted—though their details vary, their fundamental meaning remains largely the same. These texts now circulate in the world under the title *Jade Stem Transmission*.

During the *Yuankang* era of Emperor Hui of the Western Jin, the Daoist Perfected Lord Huang Fu transmitted the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper and Perfected Warrior*. In the *Xianhe* era of Emperor Cheng of the Eastern Jin, Daoist Ji Wenhua received the *Purple Radiance Scripture* from the Primordial Lady of Purple Vacuity, while the Perfected Lord Wang of Pure Emptiness Grotto transmitted the *Scripture of Great Peace*. Celestial Master Kou Qianzhi later presented it to Emperor Taiwu of the Northern Wei.

The *Perfected Warrior Scripture of the Purple Tenuity Divine Incantations, Numinous Treasure, and the Great Spontaneous Divine Soldiers for Protecting the State and Dispelling Demons* emerged in the time of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, transmitted through the lineage of Perfected Master Su. The scripture states: In the second year of the *Shanghuang* era, on the eighth day of the third month, the Venerable Lord expounded upon the *Xu* and *Wei* constellations in the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, entrusting his essence to the responsive transformation of the Sacred Father and Mystic Mother. His surname arose from the conjoining of the Three Qi into a great mass, which, in the *jianshen* month, split at dawn to form a being five hundred *zhang* in length.

The *Scripture of the Perfected Warrior’s Karmic Origins*, transmitted orally by the Master of Embracing Simplicity and the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, shares a similar purport with the original transmission. However, some corrupted passages describe the *Xu* and *Wei* constellations entrusting their essence in the Palace of Vast Spirit, transforming into a great mass that split at dawn on the seventh day of the *jianshen* month—details that invite skepticism, particularly the ambiguity regarding his parents.

As *Zhuangzi* says: "Seventy percent of my words are parables; my daily utterances are like the overflowing of a goblet." Moreover, the patterns of heaven reside above, while the patterns of humanity reside in the middle; neither can be altered, for they are the natural patterns that transform people.

The *Marvelous Scripture of the Divine Incantations of the Perfected Warrior, Great Sage of the Mystic Heaven, and His Original Transmission* was personally received by Celestial Master Zhang Daoling of Han from the Venerable Lord of the Great Ultimate. The *Veritable Record of the Perfected Warrior, Preceptor of Jade Vacuity* was compiled by the Divine Responsive and Benevolent Primordial Lord Dong, Chief Minister of the Heavenly Mechanism in the Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Palace of the Great Luo Heaven, and transmitted to the Daoist Zhang Mingdao.

The Perfected Lord declared: "The Jade Register of the Mystic Emperor is a secret celestial text, not to be heard in the middle or lower realms. Now, at the behest of the Veritable Record, it is transcribed from the Mystic Capital."

The Preface by Zhang, Perfected of Primordial Unity and Inspector of the Grotto-Heaven on Mount Wushan in the Golden Watchtower, states: "The texts of the primordial pre-celestial era do not descend to the middle or lower realms but are concealed in the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace and the Mystic Capital’s repository, transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas—how could they be casually known? Thus, the deeds of the Mystic Emperor before the pre-celestial era remain beyond comprehension. Even the true lords of the middle realm dare not speak of them, so profound is their reverence. How much less could the common folk of the lower realm, who merely hear and repeat tales, grasp their meaning?

Now, unless one is a high minister who has refined his spirit through alchemical practice, penetrated the secret texts, and attained self-realization, how could the teachings be widely disseminated? Only thus can all under heaven come to know the profound mysteries. In this way, one may truly understand Confucius and Śākyamuni, and without relying on a master, attain the subtlest truths and fathom their vastness.

Having learned that the *Veritable Record* has been bestowed upon the famous mountains and inscribed upon bamboo slips, I dare not remain silent. With incense lit, I respectfully compose this preface to commemorate its origins."

I, humble and fortunate, have lived in an age of flourishing transmission and have compiled these secret celestial texts. Though distinctions exist, they are recorded here to illuminate the mind without extinction. Those who recite and uphold these teachings shall, according to their merit, attain inconceivable virtues. Together, they shall invoke the inner talismans of *Xu* and *Wei*, aiding the perfection of the spirit of water and fire, and ensuring manifest blessings. Not only will their names be inscribed on the Jade Tablets of the Great Clarity, granting them a share in rebirth, but they shall surely receive boundless fortune.

Here ends the sixth fascicle of the *Annotated Marvelous Scripture of the Divine Incantations of the Perfected Warrior, Great Sage of the Mystic Heaven, and His Original Transmission*, as expounded by the Venerable Lord of the Great Ultimate.
