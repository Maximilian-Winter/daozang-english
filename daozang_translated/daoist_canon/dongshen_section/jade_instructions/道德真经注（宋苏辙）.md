**Volume One: Commentary by Su Xie of Lishan**

**Chapter 1: *Dao That Can Be Spoken***

The *Dao* that can be spoken of is not the eternal *Dao*.
It is not that it is not the *Dao*—
Yet what can be spoken of cannot be eternal.
Only what cannot be spoken of can be eternal.

Now, *ren* (benevolence), *yi* (righteousness), *li* (rites), and *zhi* (wisdom) are the *Dao* that can be spoken of.
Yet *ren* cannot be made into *yi*, nor can *li* be made into *zhi*.
Thus, what can be spoken of cannot be eternal in this way.

Only what cannot be spoken of—
Then *ren* is *ren*, *yi* is *yi*, *li* is *li*, and *zhi* is *zhi*.
These are all transient, yet the *Dao* remains eternal and unchanging.
Thus, what cannot be spoken of can be eternal in this way.

What can be named is not the eternal Name.
The *Dao* cannot be spoken of—how much less can it be named?
All names are of what can be spoken of.
Once names are established, then the distinctions of round and square, curved and straight cannot be eternal.

The Nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;
The Named is the mother of all things.
Eternal Non-being, to observe its subtlety;
Eternal Being, to observe its limits.

From the Nameless, form arises as Heaven and Earth;
Heaven and Earth take their place, and names begin to be established.
From the Named, it spreads into all things;
All things are nurtured, and names cannot be exhausted.

Thus, the Nameless is the essence of the *Dao*,
And the Named is its manifestation.

The Sage embodies the *Dao* for the use of the world,
Entering all things while remaining in Non-being,
Thus observing its subtlety.
Embodying the utmost Non-being while remaining in Being,
Thus observing its limits.

If one acts within its limits but does not know its subtlety,
Then it is coarse and not divine.
If one lingers in its subtlety but does not know its manifestation,
Then it is refined yet not pervasive.

These two are of the same origin but different names,
Both called *xuan* (mysterious).
Speaking in terms of form, there is Being and Non-being—
Truly two.

How do we know that Non-being transforms into Being,
And Being returns to Non-being?
It has never ceased to be one.

Though their names differ, their source is one.
Knowing the source as one, then it is *xuan*.
The further one goes without reaching an extreme,
The deeper its hue of *xuan*—
Thus Laozi often uses *xuan* to express the ultimate.

*Xuan* beyond *xuan*—the gateway to all subtleties.
Speaking of *xuan* is to reach it,
Yet still the thought of *xuan* lingers.
*Xuan* beyond *xuan* is exhausted—
No more can be added—
The origin of all subtleties.

**Chapter 2: *All Under Heaven Know***

All under Heaven know beauty as beauty—then it is ugliness;
All know goodness as goodness—then it is not goodness.

Thus, Being and Non-being give rise to each other,
Difficulty and ease complete each other,
Long and short define each other,
High and low contrast each other,
Sounds harmonize with each other,
Before and after follow each other.

All under Heaven speak of beauty and goodness in terms of form and name—
What they call beautiful and good—
How can it truly be beautiful and good?

They do not know that Being and Non-being, difficulty and ease, long and short, high and low, sounds and sequence
Generate and counter each other—
All are not their true nature.

Just as one may consider oneself long,
Yet one longer than oneself appears—then one is short.
Just as one may consider oneself foremost,
Yet one who precedes appears—then one is last.

If one follows what is deemed beautiful and believes it,
Then one is far from the truth.

Thus, the Sage acts in Non-action,
Teaches through Non-speech.
When acting, the intention is Non-action;
When teaching, the intent is Non-speech.

Thus, transcending the measures of long and short,
Separating from the numbers of before and after,
Neither beautiful nor ugly,
Neither good nor not-good—
Then how can all under Heaven know it?

All things arise without refusal,
Are born without possession,
Act without reliance,
And when accomplished, do not dwell upon it.

All things act for me, yet I refuse nothing.
I give birth to them, yet never possess them,
Never rely upon them.
When success is achieved, I do not claim it.

This is the reward of Non-action and Non-speech—
How could it be ugly or not-good?

Only because one does not dwell upon it,
Does it not depart.
The Sage dwells in poverty and lowliness without their burdens,
Dwells in wealth and honor without their encumbrances—
This is called *not dwelling*.

If I do not dwell upon it, how could others depart?
This is the ultimate dwelling.

**Chapter 3: *Not Holding Exalted the Virtuous***

Not holding the virtuous in high esteem, so the people do not contend;
Not treasuring difficult-to-obtain goods, so the people do not steal;
Not displaying what is desirable, so the heart does not become disordered.

Thus, the Sage’s governance:
Empties the mind, fills the belly,
Weakens the will, strengthens the bones.

If one holds the virtuous in high esteem,
The people will be ashamed of not being like them and thus contend.
If one treasures difficult-to-obtain goods,
The people will suffer from not having them and thus steal.
If one displays what is desirable,
The people will be troubled by not obtaining it and thus become disordered.

Though all under Heaven know these three as means of rest,
Yet if they seek to implement and abolish them, they are confused.

The Sage is not thus.
He has never failed to use the virtuous—
Only he does not hold them in high esteem.
He has never abandoned difficult-to-obtain goods—
Only he does not treasure them.
He has never removed what is desirable—
Only he does not display it.

Thus, the virtuous are employed, yet the people do not contend;
Difficult-to-obtain goods and desirable matters are presented before them,
Yet theft and chaos do not arise—
Is this not emptying the mind without harming the belly’s fullness,
Weakening the will without harming the bones’ strength?

Now if one promotes the virtuous and holds them in high esteem,
Treasures goods and values them highly,
Displays what is desirable to the people,
Then both the mind and the belly are filled.

If one implements and abolishes them,
Then both will and bones are weakened.
When the mind and belly are both filled,
The people will contend.
When will and bones are both weakened,
There will be no means to stand.

Always keep the people ignorant and desireless,
So that the wise dare not act.
If one does not display these three things,
Then the people will not know what to covet,
And their desires will be tranquil—
Even the wise will have no clever schemes to employ.

To act without action,
Then nothing will remain untamed.

To follow the natural course of these three things
Without esteeming, valuing, or displaying them—
This is called *acting without action*.

**Chapter Four: The Dao is Unfathomable**
The Dao is unfathomable yet employed,
Sometimes appearing not full,
Deep like the source of all things.

The Dao is unfathomable, reaching the void,
Yet with it, all things exist—
Though heaven and earth are vast,
Mountains and rivers wide,
It pervades them all without form,
Thus appearing not full.
Deep and boundless,
I know it as the origin of all things,
Yet dare not speak of it directly,
So it is called *seemingly the origin of all things*.

Dull its sharpness,
Untangle its complications,
Blend its brilliance,
Align with its dust—
Calm and tranquil, as if it might exist.
All people possess the Dao,
Yet the Sage preserves it whole.

Dull its sharpness, lest it stray into recklessness.
Untangle its complications, lest it clash with things.
Not straying into recklessness, not clashing with things,
External harm removed, and brightness arises—
Then harmonize it, lest it differ from things.
Brightness is purity, dust is obscurity—
Though dust may align, fear it would abandon all things.
Thus, only then is it preserved,
Calm and ever-present—
Though present, none recognize it,
Hence *seemingly it might exist*.

I do not know whose child it is,
Yet it precedes the Sovereign.
Though the Dao is ever-present,
None can name it—
Yet it cannot be said to be nonexistent,
So it is asked: *Is this not what precedes the Sovereign?*
If it precedes the Sovereign and yet precedes the Sovereign,
Then none can precede it.

**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent**
Heaven and Earth are not benevolent,
They treat all things as sacrificial dogs;
The Sage is not benevolent,
They treat the people as sacrificial dogs.

Heaven and Earth have no favoritism,
Yet allow all things to follow their nature—
Thus things spontaneously live and die.
Death is not their cruelty,
Life is not their benevolence.

Like binding straw to make a dog,
Set before sacrifices,
Adorned with utmost reverence—
Yet not out of love,
But merely the proper time.
When the rites are done, it is discarded,
Trampled by passersby—
Yet not out of hatred,
But merely the proper time.

So too the Sage treats the people:
Only by not harming them
Do they preserve their nature.
Life and death, gain and loss—
I have no part in them.
Though I have never been benevolent,
Benevolence is vast.

Between heaven and earth,
What is it but the bellows and the bellows-key?
Empty yet unyielding,
Moving yet ever producing.

The bellows and the bellows-key—
When they move, the breath they send forth
Sweeps all before it.
The unknowing take it for the pinnacle of craft,
Yet what do the bellows and the bellows-key truly do?
They are empty yet unyielding,
Thus when they move, they ever produce.

Between heaven and earth,
Their way of giving life and death to all things,
Carving and shaping all forms—
Is no different.

Much speech leads to exhaustion,
Better to hold to the central way.
Seeing it move yet produce,
The unknowing fail to grasp its response from emptiness,
Thus I tell them: *Much speech leads to exhaustion,
Better to hold to the central way, which knows no exhaustion.*

**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit Does Not Die**
The Valley Spirit does not die—
This is called the Mysterious Feminine.
The Valley is supremely empty yet still has form,
The Valley Spirit is empty yet formless.
Empty yet formless,
How could there be birth, let alone death?
It is called the Valley Spirit,
Speaking of its virtue.
It is called the Mysterious Feminine,
Speaking of its function.

The Feminine gives birth to all things,
Yet is called Mysterious—
For though it gives birth, its method is unseen.
The gate of the Mysterious Feminine
Is called the Root of Heaven and Earth.
The gate of the Mysterious Feminine,
For all things emerge from it.
The Root of Heaven and Earth,
For heaven and earth emerge from it.

Enduring yet subtle,
Used without exhaustion.
Enduring—unceasing yet unbroken.
Subtle—present yet unseen.
If one can be thus,
Even if used all day, there is no labor.

**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth Endure Long**
Heaven and Earth endure long—
Though vast, they do not depart from form and number,
Thus their endurance has measure.
Yet Laozi speaks of endurance reaching heaven and earth,
Merely from what people see.

If endurance reaches its utmost,
Then it is the beginning of heaven and earth.
Heaven and Earth endure long
Because they do not generate themselves,
Thus they endure.
Therefore the Sage places himself last,
Yet is first;
Sets himself outside,
Yet is preserved.
Is it not because he has no self-interest?
Thus he fulfills his self-interest.

Heaven and Earth give birth to things yet do not generate themselves,
Standing outside all things,
Thus they endure.
The Sage places himself last yet serves others,
Sets himself outside yet benefits others,
Standing beyond all people,
Thus he is first and preserved.

If heaven and earth competed with things for life,
And the Sage contended with people for gain,
Then heaven and earth would be but one thing,
The Sage but one person—
How could they surpass others?

Though so, their lack of self-interest
Is not to seek fulfillment of self-interest,
Yet self-interest fulfills the Dao—
Thus it is so.

**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Good Is Like Water**
The supreme good is like water.
Water benefits all things yet does not contend,
Dwells where people dislike it,
Thus it approaches the Dao.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.
To follow it is good,
To complete it is nature.

「又曰：天以一生水。
The Dao generates water with its singular essence—
For the Dao’s movement is the supreme good,
Just as *qi* moves to produce water,
Thus it is said: "The supreme good is like water."

二者皆自无而始成形，故其理同。
Both arise from the formless yet manifest shape,
Thus their principles are the same.

道无所不在，无所不利，而水亦然。
The Dao is everywhere, benefiting all,
And so too is water.

然而既已丽於形，则於道有问矣，故曰几於道。
Yet once it adheres to form,
It falls short of the Dao—
Thus it is said: "It nearly attains the Dao."

然而可名之善，未有若此者也，故曰上善。
Yet as a named virtue,
None surpass this—
Thus it is called the "supreme good."

居善地，心善渊，与善仁，一黄善信，政善治，事善能，动善时。
Dwelling in virtue’s humble ground,
Mind in virtue’s profound depths,
Giving in virtue’s boundless kindness,
Unifying in virtue’s trustworthy truth,
Governance in virtue’s harmonious order,
Action in virtue’s transformative capacity,
Movement in virtue’s timely flow.

避高趋下，未尝有所逆，善地也。
Avoiding heights, seeking lows,
Never opposing—this is virtue’s humility.

空虚静默，深不可测，善渊也。
Empty yet vast, silent yet profound,
Unfathomable—this is virtue’s depth.

利泽万物，施而不求报，善仁也。
Benefiting all things, bestowing without seeking return—
This is virtue’s kindness.

圆必旋，方必折，塞必止，次爻流，善信也。
Rounded, it must turn;
Square, it must bend;
Blocked, it must halt;
Following the path of *qi*—this is virtue’s trustworthiness.

洗涤群秽，平准高下，善治也。
Cleansing all impurities,
Balancing heights and lows—this is virtue’s harmonizing governance.

遇物赋形，而不留於一，善能也。
Meeting things, it shapes them,
Yet never clings to one form—this is virtue’s transformative ability.

冬凝春伴，涸溢不失节，善时也。
In winter, it congeals;
In spring, it thaws;
In drought, it recedes;
In flood, it swells—
Never failing its due measure—this is virtue’s timely nature.

夫惟不争，故无尤。
Only through non-contention
Is there no blame.

有善而不免於人非者，以其争也。
A virtue that does not escape human censure
Is born of contention.

水惟不争，故兼七善而无尤。
Water, through non-contention,
Embraces the seven virtues without blame.

**Chapter Nine: Holding Yet Fulfilling (持而盈之)**
Holding yet fulfilling,
Better than forcing completion;
Plucking yet sharpening,
Better than enduring loss.

Knowing that fullness must overflow,
Yet striving to hold it firm,
Better to let it not be full—
Then stability is assured.

Knowing that sharpness must break,
Yet plucking to hasten it,
Better to let it not be sharp—
Then reliance is not bound to certainty.

If the Sage possesses yet does not cling,
How could there be excess?
Following nature, then acting,
How could there be haste?

Without excess, there is no need to hold,
Without haste, there is no need to pluck.

Gold and jade fill the halls,
Yet none can keep them safe;
Wealth and honor bring arrogance,
Yet they invite their own ruin.

When merit is complete,
Name is achieved,
Body withdraws—
This is the Dao of heaven and earth.

At high noon, the sun must shift,
When the moon is full, it wanes—
The cycles of the four seasons,
Merit complete, departs.

Heaven and earth do so,
How much more so humanity?

**Chapter Ten: Nurturing Spirit and Substance (载营魄)**
Nurturing spirit and substance,
Embracing unity—can separation be avoided?

Substance differs from spirit,
For substance is matter, spirit is essence.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
*Qi* congeals to form matter,
Spirit wanders to bring transformation—
Thus one knows the nature of ghosts and gods.

Substance, as matter, is mixed yet fixed;
Spirit, as essence, is singular yet ever-changing.
To speak of nurturing spirit and substance,
It is to speak of their stillness.

The Dao is everywhere,
In humanity, it is nature—
And nature’s subtlety is spirit.

When pure and unmixed, it is called unity;
When gathered yet not dispersed, it is called substance—
Both return to the Dao,
Each following its own truth.

The Sage’s nature is settled,
Spirit is congealed,
Not swayed by things.
Though substance is his dwelling,
Spirit moves as it wills,
And substance follows without fail—
Thus spirit ever nurtures substance.

The common folk let things enslave their nature,
Spirit is dimmed, ungoverned,
And substance commands.
Eyes and ears are dulled by sounds and colors,
Nose and mouth are exhausted by scents and flavors—
Substance moves as it desires,
And spirit follows—
Thus substance ever nurtures spirit.

Hence the teaching of nurturing spirit and substance,
So the two never part—
This is the Sage’s essential method for cultivating the self.

As for the ancient *True Persons*,
Deep-rooted, firm-founded,
Long-lived, ever-visioned—
Their Dao also comes from this.

Focusing *qi* to achieve softness,
Can one be like an infant?

When spirit is ungoverned, *qi* is disordered—
The strong delight in fighting,
The weak delight in fear,
Unaware of themselves.

When spirit is governed, *qi* does not act recklessly—
Joy and anger follow their kind—
This is called focusing *qi*,
The utmost of spirit’s emptiness,
The beginning of *qi*’s substance.

At its emptiest, it is softness;
At its most substantial, it is rigidity—
Pure nature, devoid of *qi*,
This is called achieving softness.

The infant knows not good or evil,
Thus its nature is whole.

Whole nature, with *qi* refined,
Refined *qi*, with body soft—
Focusing *qi* to achieve softness,
Can one reach the infant’s utmost?

Cleansing and transcending,
Can one be without blemish?

The Sage externally is not enslaved by substance,
Internally is not ruled by *qi*—
Thus all dust and defilement are cleansed.

Then its spirit is bright and clear,
Transcending all things,
Knowing they all arise from nature,
Equally observing purity and impurity,
Without blemish or flaw.

Loving the people, governing the state,
Can one act without doing?

Having cultivated the self,
Then extending to others.
Even in loving the people, governing the state,
One meets them with a heartless heart.

If one has a heart,
Then loving the people brings harm,
And governing the state brings disorder.

**Chapter Eleven: The Gate of Heaven Opens and Closes (天门开阖)**
The gate of heaven opens and shuts—
Can one be like the female?

The gate of heaven refers to
The source of governance, chaos, ruin, and flourishing.

Having taken the body as the world’s burden,
When opening and shutting, gathering and dispersing,
The common folk prize gain yet fear loss,
Thus they act in advance to court fortune.

The Sage follows nature and knows the Mandate of Heaven,
Thus he waits for the lead before harmonizing.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
To precede Heaven yet not defy it,
Is not to precede Heaven;
To follow Heaven yet still conform to its time,
Is not to follow Heaven.

It speaks of always meeting Heaven’s Mandate,
Whether before or after—
This is all.

Otherwise, the early must hasten,
The late must falter,
Both lose the way.

Thus to say "can one be like the female"
Is to say "one must not lose the time."

**Chapter Twelve: Clarity and Fourfold Reach (明白四达)**
Clarity and fourfold reach—
Can one be without knowing?

Internally cultivating the self,
Externally governing the state,
Even in facing change,
Never lacking the Dao—
How could this not be clarity and fourfold reach?

Clarity and fourfold reach are the heart,
The heart knows nothing—
Yet it never has a heart that knows.

The heart is singular—
If again there is one that knows,
Then it is two.

「From unity to duality,
This is where obscurity arises,
And where ignorance begins.

Now, take the mirror and objects:
When things come, it responds—
That is all.
Yet how could it know what it responds to?

The essence is without form,
Yet the mind imposes upon it—
This is the source of delusion.

To nurture life without possessing it,
To act without relying on it,
To grow without controlling it—
This is called *Xuan* Virtue.

Its Dao suffices to nurture all things,
Yet it neither possesses nor relies nor controls—
Though great in virtue,
Things know it not,
Hence it is called *Xuan* Virtue.

---
**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes**
Thirty spokes converge at one hub,
Yet it is their emptiness that gives use to the wheel.
Clay is shaped into vessels,
Yet it is their emptiness that gives use to the vessels.
Walls and windows are carved for rooms,
Yet it is their emptiness that gives use to the rooms.
Thus, what is present brings advantage,
But what is absent brings use.

Exhaust knowledge and things to make vessels,
Yet the vessel’s use lies always in their emptiness.
Without the present, there is no absence to fulfill its use#1,
Without the absence, there is only the present to offer its advantage#2.
Thus, the Sage observes its mystery through constancy of absence,
And observes its clarity through constancy of presence.

To know the two as one, indivisible—
This is the ultimate.

**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**»

**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**
The five colors blind the eyes,
The five tones deaf the ears,
The five flavors dull the palate.
To see colors, hear tones, and taste flavors,
Their source all arises from *nature* (性),
When it has *nature* yet lacks *things* (物),
This is the utmost.

When the eyes feast on the five colors,
The ears feast on the five tones,
The mouth feasts on the five flavors,
They are robbed by what they feast upon and forget their source,
Then though they see, they are truly blind;
Though they hear, they are truly deaf;
Though they taste, they are truly dulled.

Chasing through fields and hunts makes the heart go mad,
Rare treasures make one’s conduct falter.
Thus the Sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes,
And so discards that to take this.

The Sage sees colors, hears tones, and tastes flavors,
All as others do.
As for chasing through fields and hunts,
He has never failed to do them,
Yet rare treasures he has never failed to reject.
Yet people all take this as illness,
While the Sage alone takes it as blessing—why?
The Sage acts for the belly, while the common folk act for the eyes;
The eyes are blamed yet cannot accept,
The belly accepts yet is never blamed—this is why.

That which comes from without is external,
This which is *nature* congealing within is internal.
**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation**
Honor and humiliation are like a startling fright,
Treating great calamity as one’s own body.

The ancient *Dao* masters (达人),
Treated honor as they did humiliation—startling,
Knew that honor as humiliation comes first.
They valued their own body as they did great calamity,
Knew that their own body as the root of calamity.
Thus they abandoned honor so humiliation did not reach them,
And lost their own body so calamity did not come.

What is meant by “honor and humiliation”?
Humiliation is the lower,
Gaining it is like a startling fright,
Losing it is like a startling fright—
This is what is meant by “honor and humiliation as startling fright.”

So-called honor and humiliation are not two separate things,
Humiliation arises from honor yet the world does not know,
Those who take honor as the higher and humiliation as the lower—all are such.
If one knows humiliation arises from honor,
Then honor is truly the lower.

Thus the ancient *Dao* masters,
Gained honor as though it were a startling fright,
Lost honor as though it were a startling fright,
Never settled in honor while fearing humiliation.

So-called “startling fright” is not true fright,
It is only *as if* startling—this is all.

What is meant by “treating great calamity as one’s own body”?
It is because of my having a body that I have great calamity,
And when I lack a body, what great calamity have I?
“Treating” means “difficult to bear.”
The root of great calamity is having a body,
Yet the scholars of the world find it difficult to bear great calamity,
Not difficult to bear their own bodies.
Thus the Sage, seeing their difficulty in bearing calamity,
Teaches them that it is difficult to bear having a body,
Knowing that having a body is the difficulty,
Then great calamity departs.

*Nature* (性) in relation to man,
Life cannot add to it, death cannot diminish it;
Its vastness can fill heaven and earth,
Its subtlety can traverse water and fire, enter metal and stone—
No thing can exhaust it.

Yet the world always exhausts and loses its original *nature*,
And only the body is seen,
The love for the body is deep,
Then only can things exhaust it.

The changes of life and death, sickness and disease attack from within,
The alternations of honor and humiliation, gain and loss assail from without—
Not a single thing that is not calamity.

Only the *Dao* masters know that *nature* is unbroken,
And the body is not real;
Suddenly forgetting the body,
All exhaustion of the world departs,
Then one can traverse the world without burden.

Thus to treat the body as the world,
As though one could entrust the world to it;
To love the body as the world,
As though one could commit the world to it.

Why men chase after power and wealth,
Drown in riches and honor,
And commit offenses without repentance—
All are but to thicken their own bodies.
Now if one bestows the world upon them,
And weighs it heavily with the body’s burden,
Then their forgetting of the body is complete.
In this way, if one gives them the world,
Though the world be vast,
They cannot take it as calamity.

**Chapter Fourteen: The Unseen**
That which is seen yet unseen is called *equanimity* (夷),
That which is heard yet unheard is called *rare* (希),
That which is grasped yet unobtainable is called *subtle* (微).
These three cannot be summoned or invited,
Thus they return and blend into one.

What is seen yet seen—colors,
That which allows colors to be seen—the unseen.
What is heard yet heard—sounds,
That which allows sounds to be heard—the unheard.
What is grasped yet obtained—tactile things,
That which allows tactile things to be obtained—the unobtainable.
These three,
Though wise men cannot question them,
Must blend and return to one,
Then only can it be so.

So-called “one”—*nature* (性).
The three—*nature*’s functions.
Man begins with *nature* alone,
And when it interacts with *things*,
Then it splits and disperses,
Becomes seeing, hearing, and touching,
Daily used yet unaware of returning to its source—
If not blending and returning to one,
Then it grows ever more distant.

If one extends this reasoning further,
Then the Buddhist teaching of the six sense-gates is the same.
The *Lengyan Sutra* (首楞严) says:
“Reverse the flow, return to unity,
The six functions do not operate.”
This is what is meant.

Above it does not shine,
Below it does not dim.
Things with form,
All depend on *yin* and *yang*,
Thus above they shine, below they dim,
And cannot escape.

The *Dao* though above does not shine,
Though below does not dim,
Cannot be traced by form or number.
Taut and unbroken, it cannot be named,
Thus it returns to *non-things* (无物).
Taut and unbroken—
Moving yet never ceasing.

Men see its moving yet never ceasing,
Then they think there are things,
Yet do not know it finally returns to *non-being* (无).
This is called the *form* of *formlessness*,
The *image* of *imagelessness*—
This is called *dimly vague* (惚恍).
*Form*—its manifestation,
*Image*—its subtlety.
The *form* of *formlessness*,
The *image* of *imagelessness*—
All are not *non-being*.
Having *being* and *non-being* cannot be named,
Thus it is called *dimly vague*.

Approach it and you see no head,
Follow it and you see no tail.
The *Dao* is nowhere not present,
Thus it has no head or tail that can be seen.

To grasp ancient *Dao* and apply it to present *things*,
To know the beginning of antiquity—
This is called *Dao*’s order (道纪).
Antiquity—
The source from which all *things* arise.

The present is the *being* of *things*,
Then the past is the *non-being* of *things*.
To grasp their source of origin,
Then advance and retreat, swift or slow, lies within oneself.

**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Master of Conduct**

The ancient master of conduct was subtle, profound, and penetrating—
Deep beyond recognition.
Coarse understanding exhausted, the subtle remains;
The subtle exhausted, the wondrous appears;
The wondrous exhausted, the *Dao* emerges—
And the *Dao* is all-pervasive, yet deep beyond recognition.

Only because it is beyond recognition,
Do we force it into semblance:
**Cautious as winter crossing a river.**
To be cautious before acting is called *cautious*—
What one intends to do, like being pressed before responding,
Cautious as one crossing a river in winter, moving with reluctance,
As if there were no alternative.

**Hesitant as fearing neighbors,**
Doubtful and thus not acting is called *hesitant*—
What one does not desire, delayed and resisted,
Hesitant as one fearing neighbors’ judgment.

**Dignified as if in reverence,**
Respectful in all things, never negligent.

**Dissolved as ice about to melt,**
Knowing all *things* arise from illusion,
Never clinging to anything.

**Unadorned as if crude,**
Artifice exhausted, returning to nature.

**Vast as a valley,**
Empty yet receptive to all.

**Turbulent as mud.**
Dulling its brilliance,
Blending with dust,
Not differing from *things*.

Who can settle mud by stillness and gradually clarify?
Who can, by enduring stillness, gradually bring forth movement?

Common scholars let *things* overwhelm their nature,
Thus they remain muddied and never clarify.
Withered scholars, through rigid stillness, extinguish their nature,
Thus they remain stagnant and never revive.

Now knowing mud disrupts nature,
We still it—stillness gradually clarifies it.
Knowing extinction of nature is not the *Dao*,
We move it—movement gradually revives it.

The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"Motionless yet not inactive,
Responding and thus harmonizing with all under Heaven."*

What is called *movement* here is just so.

Those who preserve this *Dao* do not seek fullness.
Fullness arises from excess,
Muddied and unable to clarify,
Stagnant and unable to revive—
This is why one must not be full.

Only because one is not full,
Can one be worn without renewal.
All *things* inevitably wear out.
Only because one is not full,
Does wear depart on its own without renewal.

**Chapter Sixteen: Attaining the Ultimate Void**

Attain the ultimate void,
Guard stillness with sincerity.
If the void is not ultimate,
Some *being* remains.
If stillness is not sincere,
Some movement remains.

Though hills and mountains may recede,
Fine dust still lingers—
This is not yet ultimate or sincere.

To attain the void while preserving the void,
Is still not free of *being*;
To guard stillness while preserving stillness,
Is still entangled in movement—
How much more so for others?

Without ultimacy or sincerity,
Yet demanding the use of void and stillness—
This is difficult.

All *things* arise together,
I observe their return.
With ultimate void and sincere stillness,
I observe the transformations of *things*,
Only then am I not disturbed by change.

Knowing all actions inevitably return,
If I were now to act with all *things*,
I would be unfit to know them.

*Things* teem and return to their roots.
All *things* arise from nature,
All return to nature—
Like flowers and leaves growing from roots and returning to roots,
Like waves arising from water and returning to water.

Returning to the root is stillness.
If one cannot return to nature on their own,
Even halting movement and ceasing thought to seek stillness—
This is not stillness.

Only returning to the root is true stillness.
Stillness is called *restoring the vital command*.
The *command*—the subtlest aspect of nature.
Nature can still be spoken of,
But the *command* cannot be spoken of.

The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"Exhaust reason, fulfill nature, and reach the *command*."*

The sage’s study of the *Dao*
Must begin with exhausting reason,
Proceed with fulfilling nature,
And end with restoring the *command*.

Ritual and music—
The sage’s means of engaging with *things*—
Yet their application must have its basis.
Not knowing the basis,
Yet following their names—
This is the common scholar.

Knowing the basis and then acting—
This is the noble.

This is called *exhausting reason*.
Though one exhausts the mind to exhaust reason and thus attain it,
Without seeking, it cannot be obtained.

*Things* daily construct themselves before one,
One must seek and then respond—
Thus the effort is laborious,
Yet the achievement is slight.

The sage is not obscured by externals,
His nature is serene—
Without striving, yet centered;
Without thought, yet attaining;
When *things* arrive, he responds—
This is called *fulfilling nature*.

Yet this is still *my* nature,
Still entangled in the distinction of self and other,
Almost deluded.

The ruler’s *command* is *command*,
Heaven’s *command* is *command*—
Engaging with *things* through nature,
Yet unaware of its source in me—
Thus it is entrusted to the *command*.

This is called *restoring the command*.
Restoring the *command* is constancy.
When it acts,
Even Heaven and Earth, mountains and rivers—
Nothing does not transform and decay.

Only by returning to nature
Does constancy abide serene.

Knowing constancy is enlightenment.
If one does not take returning to nature as enlightenment,
Then all is the common scholar’s cleverness—
Though they claim enlightenment,
It is not true enlightenment.

Ignorant of constancy, they act recklessly—disaster.
Ignorant of returning to nature,
They cling to *things* and move—
No action is without disaster.
Though they may succeed in the moment,
They lose in the long run.

Knowing constancy, one is tolerant.
When lost in illusion,
They insist on their own right,
Others are all enemies—
How can they tolerate them?
If one knows all is illusion,
Even enemies—
One pities and spares them—
How can they not tolerate all?

Tolerance is impartiality.
Without tolerance, no impartiality—
Who remains private?

Impartiality is sovereignty.
Without impartiality, no sovereignty—
Who would the world follow?

Sovereignty is Heaven.
Though Heaven has form,
The *Dao* is ultimate—
Yet beyond the *Dao*, nothing further can be attained.

The *Dao* is enduring.
Though one’s life ends,
It is never perished.

**Chapter Seventeen: The Supreme Sage**

The Supreme Sage—
The common folk know of his existence.
He governs the world through *Dao* and *virtue*,
Yet never forces his rule upon them.
The people do not know how it is done,
So they merely acknowledge his existence.

The next kind of ruler—
Loved and praised by the people.
He governs the world with *ren* and *yi*,
His *virtue* is cherished,
His deeds are visible,
So the people naturally love and praise him.
Though his name is fair,
This is where favoritism begins.

The next kind—
Feared and reviled.
He governs with laws and order,
The people are not without fear,
Yet where his strength does not reach,
They scorn him.
When trust is insufficient,
There is distrust.
If I truly trust myself,
Then governing the world through *Dao* is enough.
Only when I do not trust myself,
And add *ren* and *yi*,
Then pile on laws and punishments—
Then the people begin to distrust me.

Even more, he values words.
When deeds are accomplished and affairs settled,
The people say, *"It was natural."*
The Sage trusts himself abundantly,
Yet in his speech,
He still holds words in high regard,
Never speaking lightly—
And the people already trust him.
When deeds are accomplished and affairs settled,
The people daily shift toward goodness and away from guilt,
Yet they do not know it themselves.

*The Dao De Jing, Volume One of the True Classic of Virtue and the Way, Annotated by Su She of Meishan*

**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao in Decay**

When the Great Dao is abandoned,
*Ren* and *yi* arise.
When the Great Dao flourishes,
*Ren* and *yi* are practiced within it,
Yet the people remain unaware.

Once the Dao is abandoned,
Then *ren* and *yi* become manifest.

Wisdom emerges,
And great deceit follows.
The world does not know
That sufficiency alone suffices for all things,
Yet it layers wisdom upon them—
And thus the people begin to repay with deceit.

When the six bonds are fractured,
Filial piety and kindness arise.
When the state is in chaos,
Loyal ministers appear.

When the six bonds are harmonious,
Who is not filial and kind?
When the state is well-ordered,
Who is not a loyal minister?

Emperor Yao was not unfilial,
Yet only Shun was praised—
For there was no blind Zhī.
Yī Yín and the Duke of Zhou were not disloyal,
Yet only Lóng Fēng and Bǐ Gān were honored—
For there was no Jié or Zhòu.

Fish stranded in a drying marsh
Kiss to moisten one another,
Rub to keep each other damp—
Better to forget each other in the great rivers and lakes.

**Chapter Nineteen: Discarding the Sage and Abandoning Wisdom**

Discard the Sage,
Abandon wisdom,
And the people’s benefit increases a hundredfold.

**Chapter Twenty: Discarding Learning and Having No Worry**

Not possessing the Sage’s wisdom is insufficient to know the Dao,
And if the Sage’s wisdom were to rule the world,
Who would not govern all things with the Dao?

Yet the people of the world are insufficient to know the root of the Sage’s wisdom,
But they see only its branches,
And take it for cleverness in overcoming things.
Thus they race along its superficial currents,
And the people begin to suffer its harm beyond measure.

Therefore, discard the Sage and abandon wisdom,
And the people’s benefit increases a hundredfold.

Discard virtue and abandon righteousness,
And the people return to filial piety and kindness.
There has never been one who practiced virtue and abandoned their parents,
Nor one who upheld righteousness and delayed serving their lord—
Virtue and righteousness are what make filial piety and kindness possible.

Yet when they decline,
They steal the names of virtue and righteousness to gain advantage in the world,
And thus sons defy their fathers,
And fathers cruelly mistreat their sons—
This is the result of the traces of virtue and righteousness.

Therefore, discard virtue and abandon righteousness,
And the people return to filial piety and kindness.

Discard cleverness and abandon profit,
And thieves and robbers will cease to exist.
Cleverness is what facilitates affairs,
Profit is what aids things—
These two are not for thievery; if thieves and robbers cannot succeed, they will not act.

Therefore, discard cleverness and abandon profit,
And thieves and robbers will cease to exist.

These three things are insufficient for cultivation,
So they must be assigned their proper place.
Seeing simplicity and embracing purity,
Few desires and little self-interest.

The world values these three things,
Yet it believes the world’s unrest comes from their insufficiency.
Thus some attribute them to the Sage’s wisdom,
Some to virtue and righteousness,
Some to cleverness and profit—
All seeking to govern with them.

Yet the world grows ever more unstable—
Why not return to their roots?

See simplicity, embrace purity,
Few desires and little self-interest,
And the people will each return to their true nature.
Even with these three things, there will be no need for them.

Thus it is said:
I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;
I love stillness, yet the people become upright;
I meddle in nothing, yet the people grow wealthy;
I desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity.
This is the greatness of the Sage’s wisdom,
The utmost of virtue and righteousness,
The extreme of cleverness and profit.

Yet Confucius governed the world with virtue, righteousness, ritual, and music,
While Laozi discarded and abandoned them—
Some may say they differed.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
That which is above form is called the Dao,
That which is below form is called instrumentality.
Confucius’ foresight for posterity was profound,
So he showed people instrumentality while concealing the Dao,
Causing the mediocre and below to cling to instrumentality,
So they would not be dazzled by the Dao,
And thus not lose their way as gentlemen,
While those above the mediocre would naturally ascend to it.

Laozi was not so.
He was intent on clarifying the Dao and urgently sought to open people’s minds,
So he showed people the Dao while slighting instrumentality,
Believing that if scholars only knew instrumentality,
The Dao would remain hidden.
Thus he discarded virtue and righteousness,
Abandoned ritual and music,
To clarify the Dao.

The Dao cannot be spoken—
All speech is but its semblance.
The enlightened discern the true through its semblance,
While the ignorant cling to the semblance and fall into deception.

Thus in later ages, those who seized Laozi’s words to disrupt the world existed,
Yet those who followed Confucius committed no great errors.
Those who reached the Dao through Laozi’s words were many,
While those who sought it in Confucius often struggled to find an entrance.

These two sages were both constrained—
To preserve one, they must neglect the other.

**Chapter Twenty: Discarding Learning and Having No Worry**

Discard learning and have no worry.

To study is to daily increase,
To follow the Dao is to daily diminish.
Not knowing the true nature of life and destiny,
Yet seeking benefit through study,
Accumulating what one has not heard,
Piling it endlessly without unifying it,
Then the round harms the square,
The straight harms the curved—
The mind becomes chaotic,
And worry knows no end.

Alas, that scholars should reach this point!
Thus it is said: Discard learning and have no worry.

Yet the Sage never ceased learning,
But took the Dao as primary.
Not learning does not mean little learning,
Much learning does not mean confusion—
Serene and without worry,
Why speak of discarding learning?

Yes and no—
How far apart are they?
Good and evil—
How different are they?

Scholars drown in what they have heard,
Unable to unify it,
So they take "yes" as respectful
And "no" as arrogance—
Already beyond comparison,
Much less the opposite extremes of good and evil!

The Sage knows all things arise from nature,
Yet all are formed by delusion—
Like drawing horses and oxen,
Or carving tigers and leopards,
None are their true forms.
Pitifully, there is no distinction of right and wrong, same and different—
Who knows how far apart they truly are?

If one knows this,
Then all things coexist without harm,
The Dao proceeds without contradiction—
Nothing strange in that.

What people fear,
Cannot but be feared.
The Sage equalizes self and other,
Unifies same and different,
His heart leaves nothing behind—
Yet would he thereby neglect the world’s laws,
Transgress boundaries, and disrupt order without care?

What people fear,
I too fear.
What people do,
I too do.

Even amid the relations of lord and subject, parent and child,
Within the domains of ritual, music, punishment, and governance,
The world would not know the difference.
It is only his heart that does not cling to things.

Boundless—
Its endlessness cannot be measured.

All people follow what they know,
Thus rigidly confined within their narrow paths.
The Sage traverses both existence and nonexistence,
And nothing is beyond his reach—
Boundless—
Its end cannot be measured.

The crowd rejoices,
As if feasting on the grandest sacrifice,
As if ascending the terrace in spring—
I alone stand in dread, as yet unmanifest,
Like an infant not yet weaned.

All people drown in their desires—
Their beauty is like feasting on the grandest sacrifice,
Their joy is like ascending the terrace in spring—
Noisily following, yet unaware of their error.

Only the Sage delves deeply into their delusion,
Encounters it with equanimity, unmoved,
Like an infant not yet weaned.

Wandering—
As if having nowhere to return.

Riding the principles of all things without self-interest,
Thus as if having nowhere to return.

The crowd all have excess,
While I alone seem abandoned.

The crowd clings to their own knowledge,
Each believing themselves to have excess.

The Sage encompasses all things yet claims none,
Transcendent—like one abandoned.

My heart of a foolish man is pure,
Pure—yet not truly foolish.

The vulgar shine with clarity,
While I alone seem dim.

The vulgar scrutinize keenly,
While I alone am muddled and obscure.

The worldly deem discrimination as wisdom,
Yet the Sage knows the futility of distinguishing delusions—
Thus outwardly he seems dim,
Inwardly he seems muddled.

Sudden yet indistinct,
Quiet yet without end.

Sudden and indistinct,
Yet within them are forms.

Indistinct and sudden,
Yet within them are things.

The Dao is neither being nor non-being,
Thus it is spoken of as indistinct and sudden.

Yet when it manifests as forms,
And takes root as things,
None escape its indistinct and sudden nature.

Vague and dark,
Within it lies essence.

In the realm of indeterminate being and non-being,
Indistinct and sudden, yet unseen.

When being and non-being intersect,
Then its vague and dark depths are revealed—
Though formless, essence abides within.

Its essence is most true,
Within it lies sincerity.

When things reach full form,
Truth and falsity are mingled—
From one to two, then three,
Chaotic and intertwined, beyond verification.

Yet in its essence,
It does not deceive me.

From ancient times to now,
Its name remains unchanged—
To observe all transformations.

Though ancient and modern differ,
The Dao itself does not vanish,
Thus it is called "unchanging."

Only because it never vanishes,
It can witness all things' transformations.

*"Transformation"*—beauty—
Though all things are beautiful,
They cannot escape change.

How do I know this of all transformations?
By this.

The Sage knows all things' nature
Because he embodies the Dao and does not depart from it.

**Flexibility Preserves Completeness (Chapter 22)**
Flexible, yet complete—
The Sage acts only in accordance with principle,
Where principle lies, sometimes straight, sometimes curved,
Yet its essence is unity.

In unity with all things, no contradiction—
No contradiction, hence completeness.

Crooked yet straight—
Straightness without principle is not true straightness.
Following principle, though crooked, is the world’s truest straightness.

Hollow yet full—
Where all things converge is low.
Though one may not wish to be full, it cannot be avoided.

Worn yet renewed—
Clarity and scrutiny are not the Dao.
Muddled and obscure, yet daily renewed—
This is where renewal originates.

Little yet sufficient—
The Dao is singular.
To grasp the singular is to possess all.
To grasp much without unity is confusion.

Thus the Sage holds unity as the model for all under heaven.
To hold unity is to restore one’s nature.

For flexible yet complete,
Crooked yet straight,
Hollow yet full,
Worn yet renewed,
Little yet sufficient—
All are consequences of holding unity,
Thus it concludes with "holding unity."

Not self-revealing, hence clarity—
The eye does not see itself, thus it can see all things.
The mirror does not reflect itself, thus it can reflect all things.
If the eye saw itself or the mirror reflected itself,
They would have no time to see or reflect others.
Thus, not self-revealing, not self-asserting, not self-praising, not self-exalting—
All are aspects of not striving,
Thus it concludes with "not striving."

The ancients spoke of "flexible yet complete"—
Was this mere empty talk?
Indeed, it is complete and returns to its source.

The world deems straightness as right,
Crookedness as wrong.
Yet if one follows principle in the world,
There will be no avoiding crookedness,
Thus the passage concludes: *"Was this mere empty talk?
Indeed, it is complete and returns to its source."*

What is meant by "complete"?
Not merely preserving oneself—
Internally, preserving oneself,
Externally, preserving all things,
Self and all things both preserved,
And returning to one’s nature—
Then its straightness is profound indeed.

**Dao’s Simplicity and Naturalness (Chapter 23)**
The Dao is simple yet naturally expressed.

When words arise from nature,
They are simple yet precise;
When forced from unnatural origins,
They are verbose and lacking in sincerity.

Thus it is said:
*"The Dao’s utterance is flavorless,
Yet its vision is unseen,
Its hearing is unheard,
Its use is inexhaustible—
This is called simplicity."*

Gales do not last the morning,
Torrent rains do not last the day.
Who causes this?
The heavens and earth.
The heavens and earth cannot endure long,
How much more so for humans?

Yin and Yang do not contend,
Yet winds and rains come in season—
Neither hasty nor slow,
Expending their full force before ceasing.

But when Yang dominates above,
And Yin lingers below,
Suppressed without release,
Then gales and torrents arise—
As if they might never end,
Yet their force cannot last the day.

The ancient Sage spoke sparingly,
Acted with ease,
All in accordance with nature,
Thus enduring without exhaustion.

The world may weary of this,
Deeming it inferior to deceptive speech that pleases the ear,
Or bizarre conduct that startles the age,
Unknowing that such cannot last.

Thus, those who follow the Dao:
Those aligned with the Dao gain the Dao,
Those aligned with virtue gain virtue,
Those aligned with loss gain loss.

Those aligned with the Dao obtain the Dao,
Those aligned with virtue obtain virtue,
Those aligned with loss obtain loss.

Confucius said:
*"If one’s resolve is in ren, there is no evil."*

Thus it is said:
*"The errors of the virtuous are easily forgiven."*

If resolve in ren is thus,
How much more so for those resolved in the Dao?

If one truly follows the Dao,
Then what aligns with the Dao yields the Dao,
What aligns with virtue yields virtue,
And though misfortune may come,
Even in loss, one gains in virtue and power.

Faith insufficient, doubt arises.
The unknowing, lacking firm trust in the Dao,
When they falter, they doubt it further,
Thus their unbelief grows.

Only the knowing do not let gain or loss shake their trust in the Dao.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Limping Do Not Stand**

The limping cannot stand,
The striding cannot walk.
Those who self-display see nothing,
Those who self-approve are unillustrious,
Those who self-praise achieve nothing,
Those who self-glorify do not endure.

No one fails to both stand and walk,
Yet if one deems standing insufficient and adds limping,
Or walking insufficient and adds striding,
None can retain their standing or walking.

So too with those who self-display, self-approve, self-praise, and self-glorify—
They are but excess, like superfluous food or burdensome limbs.

As with eating and drinking,
Moderation suffices,
Excess brings sickness.
As with the four limbs,
Wholeness suffices,
Superfluity becomes a hindrance.

Some may detest this,
Thus the Dao is shunned by many.

---
**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Undifferentiated Whole**

There is a whole undifferentiated,
Born before heaven and earth.

The Dao is neither clear nor turbid,
Neither high nor low,
Neither departing nor arriving,
Neither good nor evil—
Yet it forms a unity,
In humans, this is nature.
Thus it is said: *There is a whole undifferentiated.*

None know its origin,
Yet it exists silently and eternally,
And from it, heaven and earth arise.

Silent and vast,
Independent yet unchanging,
Circulating yet unexhausted,
It may be called the Mother of all beneath heaven.

Silent, without sound,
Vast, without form,
Independent, without rival,
Yet never failing in all things—
Descending, it nurtures all creatures,
Thus it is their Mother.

I know not its name,
So I call it the Dao.
Forcing a name upon it, I say: *Great.*

The Dao originally has no name,
Yet the Sage saw that all things arise from it,
Thus named it the Dao.
Seeing that none can surpass it,
Thus forced the name *Great* upon it.
Yet truly, it cannot be named.

Great is fleeting,
Fleeting is distant,
Distant is returning.
Seeking it from Greatness, it flees and departs.
Seeking it from departure, it is distant and unattainable.
Though it flees and is distant,
Yet seeking it in return,
A single-minded heart suffices.

Thus the Dao is Great,
Heaven is Great,
Earth is Great,
And the Sage is Great.
Within the realm, there are four Great ones,
And the Sage occupies one.

Humans model Earth,
Earth models Heaven,
Heaven models the Dao,
The Dao models nature.

Speaking of the Dao,
Even Heaven, Earth, and the Sage
Are not as Great as it.

Yet the world knows the Greatness of these three,
But does not believe in the Dao’s Greatness.
Thus, speaking truly:
Humans are not as great as Earth,
Earth is not as great as Heaven,
Heaven is not as great as the Dao,
The Dao is not as great as nature.

Yet if one were to recover their original nature in a day,
Then these three, humans could fully embody them.

---
**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Heavy as Root of the Light**

The heavy is the root of the light,
The still is the master of the restless.

All things—light cannot bear heavy,
Small cannot govern great,
The unmoving directs the moving,
The still controls the active.
Thus the light relies on the heavy as root,
The restless on the still as master.

Hence the Sage, though traveling all day,
Never strays from his baggage.
Though adorned with fine carriages,
He rests in quietude.

To walk lightly yet not abandon one’s baggage,
To enjoy splendor yet return to repose—
Thus the necessity of the heavy and the still is shown.

How can the ruler of ten thousand chariots
Lighten himself for the world?

If the ruler burdens himself with the world
Yet lightens his own body,
He cannot bear the world.

Lightness loses subjects,
Restlessness loses sovereignty.
Lightness and restlessness have no place to apply,
Yet if the ruler is light, his subjects know they cannot rely on him,
If his subjects are restless, he knows they seek only gain—
Thus it is said: *Lightness loses subjects, restlessness loses sovereignty.*

---
**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Good Way Leaves No Tracks**

The good way leaves no tracks,
It rides the natural and thus leaves none.
The good speech has no flaws,
It speaks only when timely,
Thus its words fill the world without error.
The good plan requires no calculations,
All things’ numbers lie before it,
Known without reckoning—what need for calculations?

The good closure needs no bars yet cannot be opened,
The good binding needs no cords yet cannot be undone.

The fully virtuous toward all things
Are like a mother to her children—
Though they roam, they do not stray,
Thus no bars are needed yet it is closed,
No cords are needed yet it is bound.

Thus the Sage always rescues people,
So none are abandoned;
Always rescues things,
So none are discarded.
Those who cling to calculations to plan,
Set bars to close,
Hold cords to bind—
Their reach is limited.

The Sage toward people
Not only tolerates them,
But rescues them.
If I do not abandon people,
How can people fail to return to me?

This is called **Embracing Clarity**. To rescue people from peril and hardship is not the greatest form of rescue. When they drift through life and death, obscured by things, and I urge them toward **my utmost Clarity** and share it with them, so that even those in darkness may shine bright as lamps—passing it on, one to another, without end—then this may be called **rescuing people well**.

Thus, the **good person** is the **teacher** of the **not-good person**,
And the **not-good person** is the **means** of the **good person**.
If one does not **esteem their teacher**,
Nor **cherish their means**,
Then the Sage acts without attachment to teaching,
And thus the world acts without reverence for the Sage.
The Sage not only **forgets the world**,
But also **makes the world forget him**—
Though **wise yet deeply confused**,
This is called **the utmost subtlety**.
The subtlety of the Sage
Is such that even the wise cannot fully grasp it.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing the Heroic**

To **know the Heroic** and **hold to the Feminine** is to become the **valley** of the world.
To become the **valley** of the world, one’s **constant virtue** never departs,
And returns to the **baby-like** state.

To **know the White** and **hold to the Black** is to become the **model** of the world.
To become the **model** of the world, one’s **constant virtue** does not **compel**,
And returns to the **boundless** state.

To **know Honor** and **hold to Humiliation** is to become the **receptacle** of the world.
To become the **receptacle** of the world, one’s **constant virtue** is then **sufficient**,
And returns to **simplicity**.

The **Heroic** and **Feminine** are what comes before and after to me.
The **White** and **Black** are what comes as light and dark to me.
**Honor** and **Humiliation** are what comes as nobility and lowliness to me.

To **love what comes before** and **hate what comes after**,
To **love the light** and **hate the dark**,
To **love nobility** and **hate lowliness**—
This is the nature of things.

Yet what comes before and after to me
Is not as pressing as what comes as light and dark;
What comes as light and dark to me
Is not as deep as what comes as nobility and lowliness.

The ancient **Sages** discarded illusion to seek **recovery of their true nature**,
And the clearer their **true nature** became,
The lower their **holding** was,
The thicker their **virtue** grew,
And the greater their **return** was.

To **not act** when one does not **know** is not as profound as
To **know yet not act**—this is the utmost.

To **know the Heroic** and **hold to the Feminine** is to **know true nature**.
To **know true nature** and **cease striving with the heart**,
Then all who seek to **prevail in the world’s strife**
Will gather to it, like water flowing to a **valley**,
None will depart.

Though it is like the **baby-like** state—able to **receive** yet not yet able to **use**—
Thus it is said: **"return to the baby-like state."**

To **know the White** and **hold to the Black** is to **see true nature**.
To **dwell in darkness** yet **perceive the light**,
Then all who are **clear in the world**
Will be unable to **escape with their forms**—
Thus the multitude **follows the model** as their **law**,
Though it **responds to all things**,
The **law** never strays,
The **use** never exhausts—
Thus it is said: **"return to the boundless state."**

To **know Honor** and **hold to Humiliation** is to **recover true nature**.
When all illusions are exhausted,
To **abide in humiliation** without resentment,
Vast as the emptiness of a **valley**,
Things come and **respond to it**,
**Virtue** is sufficient here,
Pure **true nature** without admixture—
Thus it is said: **"return to simplicity."**

**Simplicity** dispersed becomes **vessels**,
The Sage **uses it** and it becomes **officials and leaders**,
Thus great **laws** are not **severed**.
The Sage, having **returned to simplicity**,
Again **disperses simplicity** into **vessels**,
To **respond to all things**.

Like a **ruler** dividing governance to establish **officials and leaders**,
It is also **following the natural course of things**,
Though **laws** are set, there is no **forcible division**.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Chapter of Taking the World**

When one is about to **take the world** and do so,
I see that it is **not inevitable**.
The Sage’s **possession of the world** is not **taking** it,
But all things **return to him**—
He **receives it** without inevitability.

His **governance of the world** is not **doing** it,
But **following the natural course of all things**,
And **removing their harm** alone.
If one **desires to take** and **does so**,
Then it cannot be **obtained**.

The world is a **divine vessel**,
**Unforced**—it cannot be **done**.
The **doer** ruins it,
The **holder** loses it.
All things are **unforced**—
Though there be **a hundred people gathered**,
If they do not **follow their own nature** and **act** inappropriately,
There will be **disputes** and **unsubmissive** ones,
And how much more so the world?

Though small things may **few in number**,
There are some that can be **taken by force** or **won by cunning**,
But as for the world’s vastness,
There is a **divine master** within it—
If one does not **await its own return**,
It will **rebel**;
If one does not **listen to its own governance**,
It will **become chaotic**.

All things either **move** or **follow**,
Are either **molded** or **shaped**,
Are either **strengthened** or **weakened**,
Are either **borne** or **broken**.
Thus the Sage **discards excess**, **discards extravagance**, **discards overreach**.

**Yin** and **Yang** surge and **counterbalance**,
The **high** and **low** **tilt and incline**,
The **great** and **small** **command and obey**—
Some **move** in front,
Some **follow** behind,
Some **yield** and are **warmed**,
Some **resist** and are **chilled**,
Some are **augmented** and **strengthened**,
Some are **diminished** and **weakened**,
Some are **borne** and **completed**,
Some are **circumvented** and **destroyed**—
All are the **natural course of things**,
And **inevitable** in their **power**.

Yet the world’s **foolish people**,
**Selfishly** and **pursuing gain**,
Now **desire to force** yet **contradict** it—
Their **calamity** will not **overturn** but **break**.
Only the Sage **knows** that it cannot be **reversed**,
And thus **follows and awaits** it,
Discarding **excess**, **extravagance**, and **overreach**,
So that it does not **reach extremes** and **injure things**,
And the world has no **suffering**—
This is the **utmost of non-action**.

**Yao** and **Tang** faced **floods and droughts**,
Though they could not **avoid them entirely**,
Yet they never **reached ruin**—
This is why.

The *Yijing* speaks of **Overreach**:
*"The later **ruler** with **wealth** fulfills the **Dao of Heaven and Earth**,
**Aids and aligns** with the **proper roles of Heaven and Earth**,
And **governs the people** with **right and left**.
Three **Yang** within, three **Yin** without—
The **extreme of things** is reached.
The Sage **fears** its **excess** and **harm to life**,
Thus **wealth** is fulfilled and **aided**,
So that it does not **reach extremes**—
This is called **discarding excess**, **extravagance**, and **overreach**."*

**Chapter Thirty: Assisting the Ruler with the Dao**

To **assist the ruler** with the **Dao** is to
**Not use force** to **subdue the world**,
And to **love the return** of things.

The Sage **uses arms**,
All **arise from inevitability**.
If not from inevitability yet **desires to force and conquer the world**,
Though sometimes **able to conquer**,
The **calamity** will **return and be repaid**.

「The rulers of Chu Ling, Qi Min, Qin Shi Huang, and Han Xiaowu—
Some perished by death themselves, some brought calamity upon their descendants.
What men abhor, the spirits detest—
None have escaped its retribution.

Where armies march, brambles and thorns arise.
After great campaigns, there are years of famine.
Where war is waged, civil affairs decay—
Thus fields lie unplowed.
After war, the **killing-qi** prevails—
Hence crops are blighted.
All wars are thus, yet how much worse is he who **uses arms to force and conquer the world**?
Therefore, the **good** man **fruits** his actions,
And dares not **take by force**.
**Fruiting** is a secondary measure.
What **virtue/power** cannot pacify, what **governance** cannot subdue,
Then, with no alternative, **force** is applied as a last resort.
Yet when he **fruits**, let him **not boast**,
Let him **not gloat**,
Let him **not be arrogant**,
And let him **not act without necessity**—
This is the **fruiting without force**.
**Not boasting**, **not gloating**, **not being arrogant**, and **acting without necessity**—
These four principles constitute **not taking by force**.

When things are at their peak, they decline—
This is called **not the Dao/Way**,
And **not the Dao/Way** brings early decay.
The peak of vigor must decline—
No thing defies this law.
Only the **good** who **embodies the Dao/Way**,
When fulfilled, appears as if lacking,
When abundant, seems as if empty—
Never overreaching, thus never declining,
Never perishing.
To **use arms to force and conquer the world** is to overreach greatly—
Yet how can it avoid decline?

**Chapter Thirty-one: On the Fine Use of Arms**
The fine use of arms is the **unauspicious instrument**,
Which men often detest—
Thus the **good** do not dwell upon it.
To employ it to **resolve difficulties**,
Yet not to make it a constant practice—
This is called **not dwelling upon it**.
The **gentleman** values the left in peace,
Yet values the right in war.
Arms are the **unauspicious instrument**,
Not the **gentleman’s** tool—
When used without alternative, **serenity** is the highest virtue.
To **victory without delight**,
Yet those who delight in it—
These are those who **take pleasure in killing**.
He who **takes pleasure in killing**,
Cannot **fulfill his ambitions** in the world.

**Auspicious matters** honor the left,
**Inauspicious matters** honor the right.
The **commander of the left wing** is stationed on the left,
The **commander of the right wing** on the right—
This is spoken of in terms of **funeral rites**.
When many are slain, let them be **mourned with sorrowful weeping**,
And **victory** should be treated as if a **funeral rite**.

**Chapter Thirty-two: The Dao/Way is Ever Nameless**»

The Dao/Way is ever nameless.

「Though crude and small, the Dao/Way commands reverence from all under heaven.
If lords and kings could but preserve it,
All things would willingly come to serve them.

Crude—this is its true nature.
Since the Dao/Way is ever nameless,
Its nature too cannot be named.
Thus, when it expands, it fills all things,
Yet when it contracts, it does not exceed the finest hair’s end—
This is why, though small, it cannot be enslaved.

Even the lowliest man, if he guards it,
May use dust and dross to mold Yao and Shun;
But lords and kings, though exalted, cannot guard it,
And so all things do not come to serve them.

Heaven and Earth unite,
And sweet dew descends—
No man commands it, yet it is evenly distributed.
The **Yin** and **Yang** *qi* rise and fall,
Uniting as one to descend sweet dew,
Which glistens upon all things,
Never failing to spread evenly.

The sage embodies the ultimate Dao/Way,
Responding to all existence—
Like sweet dew, it reaches all without exception.
This is why he can make all things come to serve him.

When the Dao/Way first took form,
Names were established.
Once names are given,
Even the wise know when to stop—
For knowing when to stop is how one avoids ruin.

The sage disperses the crude Dao/Way into **instruments**,
Then uses these **instruments** to establish names—
How could he abandon the crude for the named,
Or chase after trifles while losing his foundation?

He understands returning to its true nature,
Thus he rides through all transformations without ruin.

The Dao/Way in the world is like rivers and valleys to the great seas.
The great seas are the **reservoir** of water;
Rivers and valleys are its **divisions**.
The Dao/Way is the **origin** of all things;
All things are its **manifestations**.
All are water, so rivers and valleys return to their **reservoir**;
All are the Dao/Way, so things return to their **origin**.
He who knows others is wise,
He who knows himself is clear.

To discern is to know,
To encompass fully is to be clear.
As long as the heart of discernment remains,
One stops at knowing others but cannot know himself.
When fully encompassing, there is no longer discernment,
Thus one can know himself and yet also reach others.

He who overcomes others has strength,
He who overcomes himself is powerful.
Strength can reach others but not oneself,
Yet one who can conquer self and restore true nature—
This is beyond the reach of mere strength,
And so he may be called powerful.

He who knows contentment is rich.
The one who knows contentment finds sufficiency in what he encounters,
And so he is never without richness.
Though he possess all under heaven,
If he constantly harbors the thought of insufficiency,
Then he can never be truly rich.

The resolute have ambition.
To not contend with things yet remain ever self-strengthening—
No thing can take away his ambition.
He who does not lose his place endures long.
Things transform endlessly,
Yet if his heart never strays,
Then he endures long.

He who dies yet does not perish attains longevity.
The transformation of life and death is vast indeed;
Yet if his true nature remains undiminished and unlost,
This is the ancient **Perfect Man** who neither lives nor dies.

The great Dao/Way is vast and all-encompassing,
Its influence cannot be confined to left or right.
Vast and all-encompassing, it has neither "yes" nor "no,"
Thus it moves freely above and below,
Circulating without end.

All things rely on it to live,
Yet it does not claim them as its own.
When its work is done, it takes no credit.
The world has those who nourish things yet do not claim them—
They will surely name them as their own.
The world has those who flee from things yet do not possess them—
They will surely reject things and fail to live.
To live without claiming,
To achieve without taking credit—
Only the Dao/Way does this.

To cherish and nourish all things yet not lord over them,
To always lack desire—
This may be called "small."
All things returning to it without its lording over them—
This may be called "great."

Thus the sage never claims to be great,
And so he achieves true greatness.
If one claims greatness with a heart of greatness,
Then he is small.

**Chapter Thirty-Three: He Who Knows Others is Wise**»

**Chapter Thirty-Four: He Who Knows Contentment is Rich**»

**Chapter Thirty-Five: Grasping the Great Image**»

To grasp the **Great Image**,
All under heaven will come to it.
The Dao/Way is neither having nor lacking,
Thus it is called the **Great Image**.
If it were clearly manifest in form,
There would be likeness and difference.
The like would be loved,
The unlike would be hated.
To be loved, they would come;
To be hated, they would go—
Yet this would not suffice to make all under heaven come to it.

To come without harm,
To rest in ease, peace, and harmony.
If there is love and hate,
Then there are things to benefit and things to harm;
If love and hate are fully exhausted,
Then it is without harm to all things.

Thus the ultimate comes to rest in ease,
In peace, and in harmony.
Delight and bait,
The passing traveler stops.
The Dao/Way, when spoken of,
Is bland and without flavor;
To look upon it, one sees no form;
To listen to it, one hears no sound;
To use it, one cannot exhaust it.

To create delight and set bait,
To await those who come—
Surely this would suffice to stop the passing traveler?
Yet when the delight is spent and the bait exhausted,
They will gather it up and depart.

But if one grasps the **Great Image** to await all under heaven,
All under heaven will not know to love it—
How much less would they know to hate it?
Though it lacks scent, flavor, form, color, or sound to please men,
Its use cannot be exhausted.

**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Sage’s Way of Giving**»

When one is about to **withdraw** it,
He must first **fully extend** it;
When one is about to **weaken** it,
He must first **fully strengthen** it;
When one is about to **abolish** it,
He must first **fully establish** it;
When one is about to **take away** it,
He must first **fully give** it—
This is called **subtle clarity**.

If one takes away without first giving,
Then its **force** will not be fully realized,
And its **principle** will be lacking.
If the **force** is not fully realized,
Then taking it will be difficult;
If the **principle** is lacking,
Then things will not submit to it.
Yet this is nearly the same as using **wisdom**,
And what difference is there between it and Guan Zhong or Sun Wu?

The sage’s way and the world’s way
Do indeed have traces of similarity.

The sage rides upon **principle**,
While the world uses **wisdom**.
To ride upon **principle** is like a skilled physician
Applying remedies precisely to the disease;
To use **wisdom** is like a shrewd merchant
Seeking clever gains.

The supple overcome the rigid,
The weak overcome the strong.
The sage knows that rigid strength is not to be relied upon,
Thus he treats himself with supple weakness.
When the world’s rigid strength is contending,
Mutually undermining each other,
Yet I alone remain supple and weak to await them—
When the great are injured and the small perish,
I sit without retaliation, letting them die.
This is called victory.

Yet the sage does not intend to do this and overcome things—
He simply knows the **nature of things**,
And abides in their natural course.

「A fish cannot be taken from its depths—
the sharp instruments of a state
should not be displayed to the people.

The fish is not a creature
with claws and teeth to overpower others,
yet when it dwells in the deep waters,
even the strong and powerful
cannot seize it.
Once it leaves the depths and comes to land,
it becomes but a clumsy thing,
what can it do?

The sage abides in supple weakness,
and the rigid and strong cannot harm him.
Not only can they not harm him,
but he also uses it to **restrain the latter with the former**#3—
Is this not also the sharp instrument of the world?

The fish is only subdued
when it leaves the depths.
The sage is only able to conquer all
when he remains in supple weakness without satiety,
for this is not something shared with the common people.

**Dao/Way is ever without action yet without fail does all.**
It is without action yet without fail does all—
this is the intent of its **natural course**.

If lords and kings could guard it,
all things would naturally transform.
When transformation occurs and they seek to act,
I shall **settle them with the nameless simplicity**#2.
The sage **transforms all through non-action**,
and all things transform—
beginning from non-action,
gradually reaching action,
like the growth of an infant
and the rise of human artifice.

Thus, the decline of the Three Dynasties,
the change in human sentiment,
grows ever more severe,
when they begin to act
and the rulers above and the people below
all succumb to **decadence**#1,
their changes become so extreme
as to be beyond measure.

If they act yet are not moved by it,
and are settled with the nameless simplicity,
perhaps they may be stopped.

The nameless simplicity will also not desire,
and through non-desire attains tranquility—
the world will naturally **correct itself**.

The sage harbors no thought of **embracing simplicity** within,
nor speaks of it without,
thus his simplicity is whole
and his use is vast.
If the heart of **embracing simplicity** still lingers in the chest,
it is lost indeed.

**Dao/Way is ever without action, Chapter Thirty-Seventh** concludes.
**Dao/Way is ever without action, Volume Two of the Annotated Scripture** concludes.»

**Chapter Thirty-Eighth: The Supreme Virtue Does Not Virtue**

The supreme virtue does not cling to virtue,
and thus virtue is complete.
The lesser virtue does not lose virtue,
and thus virtue is lost.

The sage follows his heart’s desire without overstepping measure,
not deliberately cultivating virtue—virtue suffices on its own.
Those below know virtue’s worth and strive to retain it,
yet merely preserve themselves—what true virtue do they possess?

The supreme virtue acts without action, yet nothing is left undone.
The lesser virtue acts and yet still strives to act.
To act while striving to act is still action.
Only when acting without striving to act
can one truly be said to act without action.

Those below cannot succeed without action,
yet they still strive to act—
not merely performing without safeguarding.

Supreme benevolence acts without striving to act,
supreme righteousness acts while striving to act.
Both benevolence and righteousness cannot escape action—
their difference lies in this:
Benevolence excels in acting without striving,
while righteousness takes pride in acting with striving.

Virtue has high and low,
but benevolence and righteousness have only high—no low—
why?
Because those beneath benevolence and righteousness
are not worth further discussion.

Supreme ritual acts, yet none respond,
so it forces compliance with bared arms.
From virtue descending to ritual,
the sage’s means to order the people are exhausted.

Thus, when action meets no response,
it resorts to bared arms and coercion;
when coercion fails, punishments arise and arms are raised—
then it is mere performance without fulfillment.

Hence, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises;
when virtue is lost, benevolence arises#1;
when benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
when righteousness is lost, ritual arises.
Ritual, though thin in loyalty and trust,
is the beginning of chaos.
Loyalty and trust without ritual remain unseen,
but ritual established makes their virtues flare outward.

Between ruler and subject, parent and child,
husband and wife, friends—
their outward forms are rigid,
yet their inner substance is exhausted.
Thus, adherence brings order,
while defiance brings chaos.
The distance between order and chaos is infinitesimal—
hence, ritual is called the origin of chaos.

Preconceived knowledge is the adornment of the Dao,
yet the beginning of folly.
The sage gazes profoundly upon all things,
laying out right and wrong, gain and loss before him,
like a mirror reflecting forms—
nothing escapes his sight.
Yet what is before or behind?
Common folk see only with their eyes,
hear only with their ears,
think only with their minds,
and wander blindly among things,
exhausting their intelligence to seek knowledge,
occasionally glimpsing truth—
though they deem themselves enlightened,
they know not that their greatest folly begins with self-assurance.

Thus, the noble man dwells in substance, not in superficiality,
in reality, not in adornment—
and so he discards the latter for the former.
The vulgar delight in what they gain below,
forgetting what is above—
they rejoice in superficiality and abandon substance.
Who but the noble man can discard the latter for the former?

**Chapter Thirty-Ninth: The Ancient Attainment of Oneness**

In ancient times, those who attained Oneness:
The heavens attained Oneness and became clear,
the earth attained Oneness and became tranquil,
the spirit attained Oneness and became numinous,
the valleys attained Oneness and became full,
all things attained Oneness and flourished,
and the sovereigns attained Oneness to become the standard of the world.

Oneness—this is the Dao.
All things attain their being through the Dao.
Yet people of the world see things and forget the Dao.

The heavens know only their clarity,
the earth knows only their tranquility,
the spirit knows only their numinosity,
the valleys know only their fullness,
all things know only their flourishing,
and the sovereigns know only their authority over the world.
They do not know the source of what they possess—
all is the Dao abiding within.

If the heavens lost Oneness, they would fear collapse,
if the earth lost Oneness, they would fear upheaval,
if the spirit lost Oneness, they would fear cessation,
if the valleys lost Oneness, they would fear exhaustion,
if all things lost Oneness, they would fear annihilation,
if the sovereigns lost Oneness, they would fear ruin.
*"Extreme"* refers to their limits.

Had the heavens not attained Oneness, they would not yet have collapsed,
had the earth not attained Oneness, they would not yet have upheaved,
had the spirit not attained Oneness, they would not yet have ceased,
had the valleys not attained Oneness, they would not yet have exhausted,
had all things not attained Oneness, they would not yet have annihilated,
had the sovereigns not attained Oneness, they would not yet have ruined—
yet their extremes must reach this point.

Thus, the noble relies on the lowly as foundation,
the high relies on the lowly as base.
The vastness of heaven and earth,
the nobility of sovereigns—
all are governed by Oneness.

What, then, is this Oneness?
See it, and it cannot be seen;
grasp it, and it cannot be held—
yet it is the most subtle of all things under heaven,
this so-called lowly and humble.

Thus, sovereigns call themselves "lonely, few, and unworthy"—
is this not taking the lowly as foundation?
Is it not?
Those who made such claims in ancient times
merely emphasized the root while neglecting the branches.

Hence, the carriage’s parts—wheels, spokes, canopy, axles, poles, yokes, hubs, and fittings—
are countable, yet the carriage itself is not counted.
Only then does one know that the carriage is formed by what is *not* there—
this is called "using the nonexistent for utility."

Yet would heaven and earth seek to become vast through vastness?
Would sovereigns seek to become noble through nobility?

The Oneness within vastness and nobility is preserved—
this is the way they become heaven and earth, sovereigns and lords,
yet few recognize it.

Hence, there is nobility in the humble and humility in the noble—
not like jade’s polished brilliance, noble yet unable to humble,
nor like stone’s rugged solidity, humble yet unable to become noble.

**The chapter on the Dao’s movement as reversal (Chapter 40):**
Reversal is the Dao’s dynamic principle.
Returning to one’s true nature brings stillness,
yet its motionless repose,
sensing and responding to all things under heaven,
is where movement originates.

Weakness is the Dao’s utility.
The Dao has no form, no sound—
nothing under heaven is weaker than the Dao,
yet nothing surpasses its ultimate strength.
This is why it can govern all things.

All things arise from existence,
existence arises from nonexistence.
The world does not know stillness as movement,
weakness as strength,
so I reveal to them what gives rise to things.

For the world knows only that existence gives birth to nonexistence,
yet never hears that nonexistence gives birth to existence.
**The chapter on the noble hearer of the Dao (Chapter 41):**

The noble hearer of the Dao,
assiduously practices it;
the middle hearer of the Dao,
holds it as if it exists, as if it does not;
the lowly hearer of the Dao,
laughs at it.
To not laugh is insufficient for the Dao.

The Dao is not a form—
it cannot be seen;
it is not a sound—
it cannot be heard.
Without first knowing the futility of all things,
one remains unenlightened, yet still doubts—
thus, the lowly hearer of the Dao
considers it absurd and laughable.

The middle hearer of the Dao,
with it appearing and vanishing,
doubts it.

Only those who clearly perceive it
then diligently practice and embrace it without slacking.

Confucius said:
*"When I speak to him and he does not grow weary,
is it not my disciple Zilu?"*
This is the so-called noble hearer.

**The chapter on establishing teachings (Chapter 42):**
The ancient ones who established teachings
had such words, yet Laozi took only the lower part of their argument.

The Dao’s clarity is like darkness—
it illuminates all things yet is not scrutiny.
Advancing the Dao is like retreating—
though seemingly idle, it surpasses all things under heaven.

The Dao’s evenness is like its unevenness—
though it reaches everywhere, it does not carve or force.
**Virtue’s** loftiness is like a valley—
**virtue’s** loftiness is not **virtue**,
like the emptiness of a valley.

Great brightness is like shame—
to let brightness remain untainted,
this is the man who neither clings to purity nor despises impurity,
not the sage.

Expansive **virtue** is like insufficiency—
when **virtue** is vast and cannot be further added,
it rests there alone—
this is not expansion.

Establishing **virtue** is like thievery—
following the natural course of things without imposing,
though outwardly it seems like laziness,
in truth it is establishment.

True substance is like overflow—
embracing nature and holding the spirit,
adapting to transformations without losing its essence,
though outwardly it seems like excess.

The greatest square has no corners—
it preserves its vastness,
not erecting petty angles.

Great vessels take time to form—
their magnitude renders them unfit for hasty use.

Great sound is rare—
it cannot be heard by the ear.
Great image has no form—
it cannot be seen by the eye.

The Dao is hidden and nameless.
Only the Dao is good at lending and completing.
Where the Dao meets things,
it is seen in all things—
these twelve aspects are all the Dao’s manifestations in affairs.
Yet the Dao’s complete essence
is hidden in its namelessness,
only in its meetings does it extend its surplus to lend to deficiencies,
and all things rely upon it to come into being.

**The chapter on the Dao generating Oneness (Chapter 42):**
The Dao generates Oneness,
Oneness generates Twoness,
Twoness generates Threeness,
Threeness generates all things.

All things carry the yin while embracing the yang,
and the harmonizing *qi* as their balance.
The Dao is neither Oneness nor Twoness—
when it pairs with things, the Dao is Oneness while things are not Oneness,
so it is named Oneness, yet the Dao is not Oneness.

Oneness with Oneness makes Twoness,
Twoness with Oneness makes Threeness—
thus all things are generated.
Though there are myriad differences,
none fail to carry the yin while embracing the yang,
and the harmonizing *qi* as their balance—
for things arise from Threeness,
and Threeness arises from Oneness,
the natural principle of things.

What men detest is the lonely, few, and unworthy—
yet kings and dukes claim such titles.
Men of the world do not know
what gives rise to all things,
all deeming the few, the small, and the humble as lowly,
while the many, the great, and the noble are esteemed.

Yet kings and dukes, though honored,
still call themselves lonely, few, and unworthy—
the ancient enlightened ones
already knew this.

Things may be diminished yet benefit,
or increased yet harm.
What men are taught,
is also what I teach them.

The strong and rigid
do not attain their natural end.
I shall make this their guiding principle.

The world regards yielding and weakness as harm,
while strength and rigidity as benefit,
yet they do not know the truth.
Thus, I shall teach all under heaven:
*"Do you not see how the strong and rigid fail to attain their natural end?"*

Strength and rigidity are the extreme of futility.
If men know that strength and rigidity cannot escape death,
then they know that futility cannot be relied upon;
if they know that futility cannot be relied upon,
only then can they be spoken to about the Dao.

Thus it is said:
I shall make this their guiding principle.

**The chapter on the utmost yielding (Chapter 43):**
The utmost yielding under heaven,
overruns the utmost firmness under heaven.
There is no entering without resistance—
thus I know the benefits of non-action.

Using firmness to resist firmness,
without yielding, it breaks;
using yielding to resist firmness,
the yielding does not waste away,
the firmness does not suffer.
Seeking this in things,
water is the example.

Using existence to enter existence,
defenses repel each other;
using nonexistence to enter existence,
nonexistence never tires,
existence never resents.
Seeking this in things,
ghosts and spirits are the example.

Thus the sage alone can practice non-action,
and so govern all the strong,
enter and exit all things.
The teaching of the unsaid,
the benefit of non-action,
few under heaven can attain it.

---

**Chapter 44: The Chapter on Name and Body**
Which is more intimate—name and body?
Which is more abundant—body and wealth?
To value the body above name,
to honor the body while despising wealth,
is still not to have forgotten oneself.
The one who forgets oneself,
does not even possess the body—
how much less name and wealth?

Yet to esteem the body as the world’s treasure,
one must forget oneself.
Thus, when the world knows
that name is not worth cherishing,
that wealth is not worth hoarding,
then one knows how to honor the body.
To know how to honor the body,
then one knows how to forget oneself—
this is the intent of Laozi.

Which is more harmful—gain or loss?
The one who does not attain wealth
considers loss a harm;
but when wealth is gained and then lost,
the harm is even greater than loss itself.
Only by equalizing gain and loss,
balancing possession and privation,
can one avoid harm.

Thus, the more one loves,
the greater the cost;
the more one hoards,
the greater the loss.
Excessive love
leads one to do anything to obtain it—
how can this avoid depletion?
Excessive hoarding
draws countless assailants—
how can this avoid destruction?

Contentment with what one has brings no disgrace,
knowing when to stop brings no peril—
thus one can endure long.

---

**Chapter 45: The Chapter on Great Achievement Resembling Deficiency**
Great achievement resembles deficiency—
its application is never exhausted.
Great fullness resembles emptiness—
its utility is never spent.

The world regards non-deficiency as achievement,
yet such achievement inevitably falters.
It regards non-emptiness as fullness,
yet such fullness inevitably ceases.

The sage seeks great achievement
without worrying about its resemblance to deficiency,
strives for great fullness
without abhorring its resemblance to emptiness—
thus his achievement never falters,
his fullness never ceases.

Great rectitude resembles bending,
great skill resembles clumsiness,
great eloquence resembles stammering.
Rectitude that does not bend
is itself broken;
following principle in action,
though curved, remains straight.

Skill that does not seem clumsy
is itself exhausted;
trusting nature’s course,
though clumsy, is truly skillful.

Eloquence that does not stammer
is itself spent;
speaking according to principle,
though stammering, is truly eloquent.

Agitation overcomes cold,
tranquility overcomes heat,
yet purity and stillness are the world’s true norm.

To achieve without deficiency,
to be full without emptiness,
to be straight without bending,
to be skillful without clumsiness,
to be eloquent without stammering—
this is like agitation that cannot be tranquil,
tranquility that cannot be agitated.
Agitation can overcome cold but not heat,
tranquility can overcome heat but not cold—
both are stuck in one extreme,
not reaching the true norm.

Only when one is settled in purity and stillness,
untainted by any one thing,
neither achieving nor deficient,
neither full nor empty,
neither straight nor bent,
neither skillful nor clumsy,
neither eloquent nor stammering—
then one can overcome all things,
and stand as the world’s true norm.

**Chapter 46: The Chapter on the World’s Dao**
When the world has the Dao,
warhorses are turned into manure.
When the world has the Dao,
each follows its proper place—
there is no strife, yet all is governed,
thus warhorses are turned into manure.

When the world lacks the Dao,
warhorses breed in the suburbs.
No guilt is greater than craving what is forbidden,
no calamity is greater than ignorance of contentment,
no blame is greater than greed for what one desires.

To display one’s forbidden cravings to others,
is already a guilt;
but to fail in satisfying others’ desires,
the calamity is even worse.
To demand that all desires be fulfilled,
the blame is the greatest.

Even a common man
will suffer when he clings to one thing—
how much more the lord and king!
Thus warhorses arise.

Hence, to know contentment is true contentment.
The contented man
finds sufficiency in what he encounters—
thus he knows no lack.

---

**Chapter 47: The Chapter on Not Leaving the Door**
Not leaving the door,
yet knowing the world;
not peering through the window,
yet seeing the Dao of heaven.
The farther one goes,
the less one knows.

The nature of things
pervades the cosmos—
no difference in far or near,
ancient or modern.

The sage of old
knew all without leaving door or window—
for his nature was complete.

The world’s people
are obscured by things,
their nature divided by ears and eyes.
Within, they are troubled by body and mind;
without, they are blocked by mountains and rivers.
They see but do not perceive,
they hear but do not comprehend.
Even the smallest opening of door or window
can obscure and cut them off—
they do not know that the sage restores his nature
and finds sufficiency within,
yet they still seek to go out and gain more—
thus the farther they go, the less they know.

Hence the sage acts without moving,
yet knows all;
he names without seeing,
yet is precise;
he accomplishes without doing,
yet all is done.
What the nature attains,
is not merely knowing and naming—
it is to follow things’ natural course,
and achieve without effort.

---

**Chapter 48: The Chapter on Daily Gain and Loss**
To study daily is to gain—
but if one does not know the Dao
and yet still studies,
the more one hears and sees,
the more one is scattered,
and one is not yet a true learner.

Confucius said:
*"Much hearing—
choose the good and follow it.
Much seeing—
discern and understand.
This is the second stage of knowing."*

To cultivate the Dao daily is to diminish—
if one attains the Dao in a single day,
and looks upon all things,
none are not false.
Abandoning falsehood to seek the restoration of nature,
one’s nature is truly few in number.

Confucius said to Zigong:
*"Zigong, do you think I am the kind who hears much and understands it all?"*
*"Yes, is it not so?"*
*"No! I grasp one thing to thread it all."*

**Chapter 49: The Chapter on the Saint’s Lack of Fixed Intent**

Further diminish, and diminish again,
until arriving at **non-action**—
**non-action** yet nothing remains undone.

Abandon falsehood to seek the restoration of nature,
this may be called diminishing.
Yet the mind of abandoning falsehood still lingers;
until it also forgets this mind,
and returns to pure nature without remainder,
then nothing remains undone,
yet one does not lose **non-action**.

To take the world is often done through **non-action**—
when there is action,
it is insufficient to take the world.

All men possess the mind of taking the world,
thus they create affairs to seek it,
and their intent is revealed outwardly,
while things resent them—
hence, it can never be attained.

The Sage practices **non-action**,
thus there are no affairs.
His intent is revealed outwardly,
yet things find peace in it—
though he does not take the world,
the world is drawn to him.

---

**Chapter 50: The Chapter on Life and Death**

Life and death are born and enter,
but nature knows neither.
To emerge is to be born,
to return is to die.

Those who cling to life number thirteen,
those who cling to death number thirteen,
and men who live yet are moved toward death number thirteen.

Those who take **substance** and refine **essence** to nourish themselves
are among those who cling to life.
Those who indulge in **sounds, colors, aromas, and tastes** to harm themselves
are among those who cling to death.
These two have already divided the Dao of life and death.

I also know **action** yet do not know **rest**,
know **speech** yet do not know **silence**,
know **thought** yet do not know **forgetting**,
and thus pursue **exhaustion**—
this is what is called being moved toward death.

The Dao of life and death may be spoken of in ten terms,
and the three categories each occupy three—
is it not that nine belong to the Dao of life and death,
while only one belongs to the Dao of neither life nor death?

Neither life nor death,
this is what the *I Ching* calls **"tranquil stillness, unmoved"**—

Laozi speaks of the nine,
yet does not speak of the one,
letting man find it himself,
to entrust the mystery of **non-thought, non-action**.

Why is this so?
Because of the profoundness of **eternal life**.

「Thus, where there is life, there is death,
and so those who cling to life are but those who cling to death.

The reliance of man upon life is profound,
and thus the Dao of death is ever nineteen-fold.

For I have heard that those skilled in preserving life
walk upon land without encountering rhinoceros or tigers,
enter battle without being struck by armor or weapons.

The rhinoceros has no place to lodge its horn,
the tiger no place to set its claws,
and weapons no place to hold their blades.

Why is this so?
Because there is no place of death for them.

The **Perfect Ones** dwell perpetually in the realm of neither life nor death—
if there is no place of life, how much less a place of death?

**Chapter Fifty-One: The Dao Nourishes and Accumulates**

The Dao gives birth to life,
**virtue** nurtures and sustains it,
things take their form from it,
and **force** brings them to completion.

The Dao is the mother of all things,
and thus it is the Dao that gives birth to all things.
When its movement becomes **virtue**, it tends to the multitude without wearying,
and thus it is **virtue** that sustains all things.

Yet **virtue** and the Dao cannot manifest themselves alone;
they rely on things to reveal their presence.
Things cannot complete themselves alone;
near and far interact,
hard and soft intermingle,
and through accumulation, **force** arises,
only then do the changes of flourishing and decline, order and chaos, come to fruition.

Therefore, all things revere the Dao and hold **virtue** in high esteem.
Though form arises from things and completion from **force**,
without the Dao, there would be no birth,
and without **virtue**, there would be no sustenance.
Thus, to revere the Dao and hold **virtue** in high esteem,
to revere it as one would a father or elder brother,
to hold it in high esteem as one would a noble lord,
for the Dao is without rank while **virtue** bears a name.

The reverence of the Dao and the honor of **virtue**,
none bestow them yet they remain ever natural.
Those who rely on rank to attain reverence and honor,
are not truly revered or honored.
Hence the Dao nourishes, sustains, grows, matures, and fosters all things—
giving birth yet not possessing,
acting yet not relying,
lengthening yet not controlling.
This is called **mysterious virtue**.

**Chapter Fifty-Two: The Beginning of the World**

The world has a beginning,
which serves as the mother of all things.

The **Nameless** is the beginning of heaven and earth;
the **Named** is the mother of all things.
Before the Dao takes on the **Named**, it is the source from which things arise;
when it takes on the **Named**, it is the means by which things are born.
Thus it is called both **beginning** and **mother**.
Its offspring are all things.

Having obtained its **mother**,
one knows its offspring;
having known its offspring,
one returns to guard its **mother**,
and thus one’s life is never in peril.

The sage embodies the Dao to encompass all things,
like one who knows the child through the mother—
clearly perceptive without fail.
Though their wisdom may encompass all things,
they never forget the Dao in their pursuit of things,
and thus they always return to guard its **mother**.

Stop their **joys** and close their **gates**,
and they will never tire in their lifetime.
Open their **joys** and aid their pursuits,
and they will never be saved in their lifetime.

All under heaven possess this Dao,
yet they constantly rest and forget the Dao while yielding to things.
The eyes delight in colors,
the ears delight in sounds,
and when their delightful hearts are opened,
their affairs are aided—
thus they fall into ruin all their lives and cannot be saved.

The reason the sage remains unmoved throughout life,
is that they stop and close their **gates**,
never venturing forth to yield to things.

Seeing small as clear,
delight is harmful.
The beginning is small yet grows vast.
Knowing that small will become great and closing it,
this may be called clear.

Guarding softness as strength.
Following what one delights in without restraint,
one may think oneself strong,
yet this is not true strength.
Only those who see delight and fear it,
may be called truly strong.

Using its **radiance** yet returning to its **clarity**,
without leaving one’s body to harm,
this is called **embracing constancy**.

Common folk open their **delights** and yield their bodies to things,
going forth without return.
The sage stops and closes their **gates**,
not rejecting things outright,
but responding with their **spirit** and using its **radiance** alone—
their body does not engage.

The ears can hear,
the eyes can see,
the nose can smell,
the mouth can taste,
the body can touch,
and the mind can think—
all these are called **radiance**.

Indeed, **radiance** interacts with things,
but when things depart, **clarity** is undiminished.
Thus it responds to all changes without exhaustion,
and harm does not reach its body.
Hence its constant nature remains pure and unbroken.

**Chapter Fifty-Three: Let Me Be Simple**

If I were to be simple and yet possess knowledge,
walking the Great Dao,
I would only fear **excess**.

Those who embody the Dao have no knowledge, no action, no contrivance,
yet things transform naturally.

Now, if I were simple yet possess knowledge while walking the Great Dao,
I would have no contrivance or establishment,
yet there would be that which is worthy of fear.

The Great Dao is most smooth,
yet people love shortcuts.
The Great Dao is smooth and easy,
without obstacles or perils,
but those who do not know it
think it circuitous and slow,
and prefer shortcuts for quickness.

Thus, all who conform to their natural inclinations yet contrive,
are but those who seek speed.

The court is ever adorned,
the fields ever overgrown,
the granaries ever empty.
Wearing fine embroidery,
bearing sharp blades,
disdaining food,
yet hoarding wealth—
this is called **empty display**.

Is this not the Dao? No.

The vulgar crowd are bright and clear,
I alone seem muddled and dim;」

The vulgar crowd are sharp and discerning,
I alone am muddled and obscured.
Why then adorn the superficial and neglect the root,
merely contriving for empty display,
boasting to deceive and steal?

**Chapter 54: The Virtue of Firm Establishment**
Those who establish virtue firmly are unshaken,
those who embrace it closely are not abandoned.
Their descendants’ sacrifices never cease.

Does the world truly have those who establish yet are unshaken,
or embrace yet are not abandoned?
Only the Sage knows the true nature of essence,
discerns the falsehood of things,
abandons external things to cultivate the self—
their virtue accumulates and overflows,
yet they establish nothing, and yet their foundation is unshaken;
they grasp nothing, and yet their embrace is unbroken.
Thus, even to their descendants,
sacrifices never cease.

Cultivate the self, and virtue becomes true;
cultivate the family, and virtue becomes abundant;
cultivate the village, and virtue becomes enduring;
cultivate the state, and virtue becomes flourishing;
cultivate the world, and virtue becomes universal.
Once the self is cultivated,
its overflow extends outward—
even governing the world is possible.

Thus, observe the self to understand the self,
observe the family to understand the family,
observe the village to understand the village,
observe the state to understand the state,
observe the world to understand the world.
How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

What lies beyond heaven and earth
is unseen by the vulgar crowd,
yet its principle can be inferred and known.

When cultivation of the self reaches its peak,
observing the self to understand the self,
observing the family to understand the family,
observing the village to understand the village,
observing the state to understand the state—
all are within my grasp.
Yet how do I know the Sage,
observing the world to understand the world,
does not do so as I observe the self?
Why should the self be observed by the self,
while the world cannot be observed by the world?
Thus it is said: *How do I know the world is thus? By this.*
For it is known through the self alone.

**Chapter 55: The Depth of Contained Virtue**
The depth of contained virtue is like that of an infant.
Though Laozi often likens morality to an infant,
he speaks only of its form,
not yet its function.

Now, the infant is tranquil and without desire—
its essence is complete.
Yet when things approach, it does not respond,
so its function remains unspoken.

Poisonous creatures do not sting,
ferocious beasts do not seize,
eagles do not snatch.
The Dao is formless, unseen by things—
how much less can it be harmed?

What makes humans susceptible to form
is their having a mind.
Thus, with a mind comes form,
with form comes adversaries,
and with adversaries comes injury.

The mindless have no adversaries—
how then can they be harmed?

The infant’s state is thus:
bones weak, sinews soft, yet grip firm;
unaware of sexual union, yet life arises—
essence is at its peak.
Without grasping, yet naturally held,
without desire, yet naturally formed—
thus it is known that essence is abundant,
not of the mind.

Crying all day yet never hoarse—
harmony is complete.
When the mind moves, qi is injured;
when qi is injured, crying becomes hoarse.
Crying all day yet never hoarse—
thus it is known that the mind is undisturbed,
and qi is in harmony.

Harmony is called *constant*.
Harmony means external things do not harm the internal.

Returning to the original is called *constant*,
encountering things yet knowing to revert to the root.

Harmony is called *constant*,
obtaining the original to respond to all things.

They are one principle—
thus all are called *constant*.

Knowing *constant* is called *clarity*,
excessive life is called *omen*—
life cannot be excessive,
yet if one seeks to excess it,
this is not the right way.
An *omen* is a *portent*.
Forcing qi through the mind is called *strength*.
Qi resists unnatural movement,
yet when the mind forces it,
it becomes violently strong.

When things are at their peak, they decline—
this is called *not the Way*,
and *not the Way* decays early.
Forcing life exhausts qi,
unable to let it follow its nature.
Entering rigidity and strength,
aging follows—
thus the infant’s nature is lost.

**Chapter 56: The Wise Do Not Speak**
The wise do not speak,
those who speak are not wise.

**Chapter 57: The Mysterious Unity**

Block its senses,
close its gates,
dull its sharpness,
untangle its confusion,
harmonize its brilliance,
blend with its dust—
this is called *Mysterious Unity*.

The Dao cannot be spoken of,
yet it is not apart from speech,
but those who know it may not speak,
and those who speak may not know it.

Only by blocking the senses and closing the gates to shut out the external,
by dulling sharpness, untangling confusion, harmonizing brilliance, and blending with dust to govern the internal,
does one remain silent and align with the Dao.

Thus, it cannot be approached as close or distant,
cannot be grasped as beneficial or harmful,
cannot be esteemed as noble or base—
and so it is held in highest honor by the world.

If it can be approached as close, it can be pushed away.
If it can be grasped as beneficial, it can be turned to harm.
If it can be esteemed as noble, it can be brought low.

Those who embody the Dao cover all things equally—
who then is truly close or distant?
They observe reversals and顺 (*shùn*) impartially—
who then knows gain or loss?
Ignorant of honor and disgrace—
who then distinguishes noble from base?

The mind’s schemes cannot fathom this—
thus the world holds it in highest honor.

**Chapter 58: Governing with the Rectified Way**

Govern with the rectified Way,
employ the extraordinary in warfare,
and take the world without action.

The ancient sages softened the distant while strengthening the near,
having no intention of waging war—
only when unavoidable did they resort to arms.
Thus, governing the state is the rectified Way,
while waging war is the extraordinary.

Yet even this is insufficient to take the world.
The world is a divine instrument—
it cannot be forced, for those who force it fail,
and those who grasp it lose it.
Only those who embody the Dao stand effortlessly beyond action,
and though they do not take the world, the world submits to them.

How do I know this is so?
When the world abounds in taboos, the people grow poorer;
when the ruler multiplies taboos, the common voice cannot reach above—
thus the people grow poor and without recourse.

When the people wield sharp tools, the state grows confused;
sharp tools are stratagems.
When a wise ruler presides, he keeps the people in ignorance,
so they know nothing and desire nothing.

If the people abound in stratagems, their ruler grows dazzled and confused.
If the people rely on cleverness, strange things proliferate—
when people abandon their roots and chase after superficial gains,
then useless and harmful things arise.

When laws multiply, thieves and robbers increase.
Distrusting the deceit of people, rulers multiply laws to overcome them—
the people, with nowhere to turn, daily fall into thievery.

Thus the sage says:
*I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;
I love stillness, yet the people align themselves;
I do nothing, yet the people grow rich;
I desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity.*

**Chapter 58 (continued): The Governance of Obscurity**

When governance is obscure, the people are pure;
when governance is scrutinizing, the people grow weary.

Calamity is the reverse of fortune,
fortune is the foundation of calamity.
Who knows their limits?
There is no fixed rectitude.

Rectitude becomes the extraordinary,
the good becomes the ominous—
the people’s confusion has long endured.

The vastness of heaven and earth,
yet the common view is dazzled and does not know.

Fortune leans on calamity,
calamity lurks within fortune—
like the succession of day and night, cold and heat.

Rectitude becoming the extraordinary,
the good becoming the ominous—
like the cycle of old and young, life and death,
never truly fixed—yet the confused do not know.

Only the sage stands beyond all things,
surveying their beginning and end,
grasping their completeness,
abandoning petty scrutiny.
To the eye, governance appears obscure—
yet the people are pure, each preserving their nature.

As for the common folk,
they know not the Dao’s full body,
taking what the ears and eyes perceive as ultimate.
They deem themselves fortunate,
yet know not the calamity hidden behind;
they deem themselves good,
yet know not the ominous arising within.

Narrowly, they take scrutiny for clarity—
when scrutiny is extreme,
it harms things without realizing its error—
how pitiable!

Thus the sage is square yet does not cut,
sharp yet does not wound,
straight yet does not overreach,
bright yet does not dazzle.

Knowing that petty scrutiny cannot exhaust things,
though capable of being square, upright, and bright,
they do not employ these abilities,
fearing to fall into one-sidedness without return—
this is what the world calls *obscure governance*.

**Chapter 59: Governing People and Serving Heaven**

To govern people and serve Heaven,
nothing surpasses *frugality*.

Only through frugality is early cultivation achieved.
Early cultivation is called *heavy accumulation of virtue*—
heavy accumulation of virtue means nothing is unconquerable,
nothing is unconquerable means its limits are unknown,
and unknown limits mean one can possess a state.

The foundation of possessing a state,
this can endure long.

All things, when square, are cut;
when sharp, they wound;
when straight, they overreach;
when bright, they dazzle.

Only the sage is square yet does not cut,
sharp yet does not wound,
straight yet does not overreach,
bright yet does not dazzle—
this is called *sound*.

Sound is having without using.
The world’s affliction is its inability to subdue others—
if one truly possesses *sound* and can embody it,
though never competing with others,
others know they cannot overcome it—
thus they submit early.

Once they submit, their power is withdrawn,
until death, never tested—
then virtue is heavily accumulated.

When virtue is deeply accumulated,
even the world’s strongest cannot conquer—
thus none can measure its extent.
Only then can one possess a state.

As for the petty men of the world,
they wield even a finger’s power lightly—
once they fail to subdue, the world measures their depth and contests them.
Though they wish to preserve their state,
they cannot.

Thus I know *sound* can bring possession of a state,
and possession of a state is the mother of a state.
This is called *deep roots and firm foundations*—
the Way of long life and enduring vision.

*The Mencius* says:
*Exhaust the heart, nurture the nature—
this is how one serves Heaven.*

「To govern people through *sound* (Dao/Way),
is what enables one to possess a state.
To serve Heaven through *sound*,
is to establish *deep roots and firm foundations*—

The sages of antiquity
preserved the constancy of their nature and life,
not wasting themselves on external matters.
Within, their roots are deep and cannot be uprooted,
their foundations are firm and cannot be shaken—
thus, even longevity and enduring vision are attainable.

Indeed, governing people and serving Heaven,
though differing in internal and external aspects,
are both ultimately unified in *sound*.

---
**Chapter LX of *The Treatise on Governing Great States***:
To govern a great state,
is like cooking a small fish delicately.
Cooking a small fish delicately,
one must not disturb it;
governing a great state,
one must not weary the people.
To weary them brings their exhaustion,
to disturb brings the fish’s ruin.
When the Dao/Way is applied to the world,
its spirits are not *divinely powerful* (神).

The sage acts without action,
letting people each find rest in their natural state.
Externally, they seek nothing;
internally, they fear nothing—
thus, none can intrude upon them.
Even spirits have no need to display *divine power*.

It is not that the spirits are not *divinely powerful*,
but that their *divine power* does not harm people.
It is not that their *divine power* does not harm people,
but that the sage also does not harm people.
It is not that the spirits’ *divine power* is not *divinely powerful*,
but also that their *divine power* does not harm people.

It is not that the *divine power* does not harm people,
but that the sage has never harmed people—
thus, spirits have no power to act.

When two do not harm each other,
*virtue* (德) and *spirit* (神) naturally return to one another.
The reason people and spirits do not harm each other,
is that there is a sage above them—
thus, *virtue* and *spirit* naturally return to one another.

**Chapter 61: The Great Realm Follows the Low**
The great realm follows the low, and the world naturally turns to the great realm,
just as all waters flow toward the lowlands.
The world’s confluence, the world’s *yin* (牝).
The *yin* always conquers the *yang* (牡) through stillness,
and stillness is the path of the low.
All things in motion seek stillness,
just as all high places descend to the low.
Thus, when the great realm follows the low of lesser realms, it takes them;
when the lesser realm follows the low of the great realm, it is taken by them.
If the great realm follows the low, then lesser realms will attach to it;
if the lesser realm follows the low, then the great realm will accept it.
Hence, sometimes one follows the low to take, sometimes one follows the low to be taken.
The great realm follows the low to take others,
the lesser realm follows the low to be taken by others.
The great realm seeks only to encompass and nurture all,
the lesser realm seeks only to enter and serve others.
Both attain what they desire,
so the great realm should follow the low.

---

**Chapter 62: The Dao is the Hidden Essence of All Things**
The Dao is the hidden essence of all things,
a treasure for the virtuous, a safeguard for the unvirtuous.
Fine words can be sold, noble deeds can be bestowed upon others.
If a person is unvirtuous, why should they be abandoned?
All things that appear outwardly are but their thresholds and halls.
The Dao in things is like their hidden essence—
every thing possesses it, yet no one truly sees it.
Only the wise can grasp and hold it,
hence it is called the treasure of the virtuous.
The foolish, though unable to possess it,
cannot remain at peace without the Dao,
hence it is called the safeguard of the unvirtuous.
The Dao is not distant from people,
yet people often distance themselves from it.
If one truly speaks of the Dao’s beauty,
it can be traded in the world;
if one practices its noble ways,
it can be bestowed upon others.
Morning they act without righteousness,
evening they hear the great Dao—
their falsehoods exhausted, their nature restored,
though one might wish to point out their unvirtue,
it cannot be found—
and why should they be abandoned then?
Thus, to establish the Son of Heaven and appoint the Three Exalted Ministers,
even with a jade tablet held before four thoroughbreds,
it is not as good as simply sitting and offering this Dao.
To establish the Son of Heaven and appoint the Three Exalted Ministers
is to save the people through the Dao.
Though the jade tablet is precious and the thoroughbreds fine,
offering them is not as beneficial as offering this Dao.
The ancients valued this Dao so highly,
not because they sought to gain it or to escape punishment through it,
but because it is the most noble for all under Heaven.
The Dao originates within us,
yet people suffer from not seeking it—
if they seek it, they will find it.
The Dao has no merit or fault,
yet people suffer from not knowing it—
if they know it, no fault can taint them.

---

**Chapter 63: The Way of Non-Action**
To act without action, to manage without managing, to savor without savoring.
Great or small, much or little—
to repay resentment with *virtue*.
The sage acts without action,
so there is nothing they cannot do;
they manage without managing,
so there is nothing they cannot oversee;
they savor without savoring,
so there is nothing they cannot appreciate.
In matters of greatness or smallness, abundance or scarcity,
they simply meet them with the Dao.
What people cannot forget is resentment,
yet when their love and hatred are forgotten,
even repaying resentment is like repaying *virtue*.
To seek difficulty in what is easy,
to see greatness in what is small—
the world’s most difficult tasks must begin in ease,
the world’s greatest matters must arise from the minute.
Thus, the sage never seeks what is great,
and so they achieve what is great.
Light promises must be few,
many easy things bring many difficulties—
so the sage considers what is difficult,
and thus they never face difficulty.
All people fear what is great and scorn what is small,
shun what is difficult and embrace what is easy.
When they wait until things are difficult before acting,
or until things are great before pursuing them,
their undertakings often fail.
The sage treats greatness and smallness equally,
unifies abundance and scarcity,
fears nothing, finds nothing difficult—
how could their undertakings ever fail?
Its ease lies in its firmness—

---

**Chapter 64: Its Ease Lies in Its Firmness**
Its ease lies in its firmness,
its unseen potential lies in early planning,
its fragility lies in its lightness,
its subtlety lies in its dispersion.
To act before things arise,
to govern before chaos comes.
When things have not yet arisen,
firmness and planning suffice.
When they are about to arise,
only lightness and dispersion can remove them—
yet this is still better than when they are already formed.
Thus, acting before things arise is the highest,
governing before chaos comes is the next best.
A tree thick enough to embrace grows from a tiny sprout;
a nine-tiered tower rises from a pile of earth;
a thousand-*li* journey begins beneath one’s feet.
Those who act will ruin it,
those who grasp will lose it—
so the sage acts without action,
and thus there is no ruin;
they grasp without holding,
and thus there is no loss.
The coming of disorder, calamity, fortune, and misfortune
are all like these three things.
The sage accumulates the small to achieve the great,
holds firm without action,
guards without grasping—
secretly letting roots grow of their own accord,
letting calamity vanish on its own.
Like planting seeds,
deeply tilling and richly fertilizing—
when autumn comes, they flourish.
Like being robbed,
sitting calmly and watching keenly—
the thief will soon retreat.
The people of the world do not understand the natural order of things,
believing that nothing is accomplished without action,
nothing is retained without grasping—
so they constantly vie with calamity for victory,
struggle with fortune for excess#1,
and thus calamity arrives when it cannot be saved,
fortune arrives when it cannot be completed—
this is the natural consequence of their ways.
The people’s undertakings often succeed when they are just beginning,
then fail when they are nearly complete.
To be cautious at the end as at the beginning,
then there will be no failed undertakings.
The sage knows the harm of action,
does not aid Heaven by forcing outcomes,
and from beginning to end follows what is natural—
so there is nothing they cannot complete.
The people’s hearts dwell on gain and loss,
and even when their undertakings are still slight,
they have those who do not know and let them follow their own nature—
but when they see things almost formed,
they fear loss and ruin them—
there has never been one who did not consider this a failure.
Hence it is said: *To be cautious at the end as at the beginning,*
then there will be no failed undertakings.
Thus the sage desires without desiring,
does not prize hard-to-obtain wealth;
they study without studying,
return to the errors of the common people.
To assist the natural unfolding of all things,
and never dare to act.
All people follow what they praise to harm things,
believe what they learn to harm principle.

The sage is not without praise,
but praises without desiring—
thus though joyous, they do not harm the **Dao/Way** of things.

They are not without learning,
but learn without learning—
thus though learned, they do not harm the **principle**.

Then within and without, they are empty and clear,
boundless and without action,
able to assist the **natural unfolding of all things**,
and await their own completion.

**Chapter Sixty-Five: The Ancient Sage as Way**
The ancient sage who excelled in the **Dao/Way**,
was not to enlighten the people,
but rather to bewilder them.

The so-called wise of old,
grasped the **completeness of the Dao/Way**,
and surveyed the **beginning and end of all things**—
thus they were truly honored.

Common folk cannot know this,
and are drowned in petty cleverness,
taking scrutiny for enlightenment—
thus the harm of their wisdom is manifold.

Therefore the sage governs the people with the **Dao/Way**,
not to enlighten them,
but rather to bewilder them.

They make them without knowing, without desiring,
and let them follow the **ruler’s** actions—
though there may be faults, they are slight.

The people know that they are hard to govern,
because their wisdom is too great.

Thus to govern with wisdom is to rob the state;
I use wisdom to guide the people,
and the people also use wisdom to counter me—
then ruler and subjects mutually rob each other.

Not to govern with wisdom is the state’s blessing.

Knowing these two points,
is the **standard model**.

To know the **standard model**,
is called **Mysterious Virtue/Power**.

**Mysterious Virtue/Power** is profound and distant,
contrary to things—
then alone does it reach **Great Harmony**.

What I value is **virtue/power**,
what things blame is wisdom—
**Virtue/power** and wisdom are inherently opposed,
yet wisdom follows what is small,
while **virtue/power** follows what is great.

**Chapter Sixty-Six: The Ruler of All Things**
The reason the **river and sea** can be the **ruler of all valleys**,
is that they excel in **yielding**—
thus they can be the **ruler of all valleys**.

Therefore the sage desires to be above others,
by letting their words **yield**;
desires to lead others,
by placing themselves behind.

The sage does not **force** themselves above others,
nor **desire** to lead them—
they **yield** and **step back**,
and thus their **Dao/Way** naturally rises and leads.

Therefore when they are above, others do not grow weary;
when they are before, others are not harmed.
Thus the world gladly follows them without growing tired,
for they do not **contend**,
and so none in the world can **contend** with them.

**Chapter Sixty-Seven: The World’s Judgment**
The world all says my **Dao/Way** is great,
yet seems unfit.

Only because it is great,
does it seem unfit.

If it were fit for long,
its subtleties would be exhausted.
The **Dao/Way** is vast and formless,
decayed and nameless,
pervading all things,
yet not resembling any one thing—
this is why it is great.

If it resembles things,
then it is but one thing—
how can it be great?

I have three treasures,
which I preserve and uphold:
One is **compassion**,
two is **frugality**,
three is **not daring to act before the world**.

The **Dao/Way** is great because it does not resemble things,
so when it flows into **virtue/power**,
it is also **obscured**—
using **dullness** as sharpness,
using **retreat** as advancement,
not conforming to worldly conventions.

Now the worldly values boldness,
prizes vastness,
boasts swift progress,
while what I treasure is **compassion, forbearance, frugality, modesty, contentment, and retreat**.

These three are what the world calls unfit.

**Compassion** is why one can be **courageous**;
The world ranks **courage** as secondary virtue,
and considers **compassion and forbearance** as insufficient for action—
they do not know that **courage** ranked second is easily broken,
while **compassion and forbearance** are invincible—
in the end, they must return to **compassion**.

**Frugality** is why one can be **vast**;
The world values **vastness** as covering all things,
and considers **restraint and modesty** as vulgar—
they do not know that **vastness** is easily exhausted,
while **frugality and modesty** are easily sufficient—
in the end, they must return to **vastness**.

**Not daring to act before the world** is why one can become **instrumental and long-lasting**;
The world regards **swift progress** as capable,
and considers **not daring to lead** as shameful—
they do not know that **swift progress** harms many,
while **not daring to lead** brings joy to the world—
in the end, they must finally become **instrumental and long-lasting**.

From the **primordial simplicity** scattering, things become **instruments**;
The sage employs them, and they become **officials and leaders**.
Since the **primordial simplicity** becomes **instruments**,
there are those who belong to them and those who lead them.

Now if one abandons **compassion** for **courage**,
abandons **frugality** for **vastness**,
abandons **retreat** for **leadership**—
death follows.

**Courage, vastness, leadership**—
these three are what all people detest.

To be detested by all,
is to always be near death.

**Compassion**—
when wielded in war, it wins;
when used in defense, it holds firm.
When heaven intends to save them,
it shields them with **compassion**.
With **compassion** to guide things,
things love them as their own parents—
they will even die for them without hesitation,
thus they can wage war and defend.
When heaven intends to save this person,
it opens their heart and mind,
makes them **compassionate toward all**,
**compassionate toward all**—
then all things will guard them.

**Chapter Sixty-Eight: The Virtuous Scholar**
The virtuous scholar does not **wield force**;
Scholars should take **force** as their foundation**,
but act with **timidity**—
if they act with **force** in **force**, they will die.

The skilled warrior does not **rage**;
The sage fights only when unavoidable—
if they fight out of **rage**, it is because I would kill others.

Killing others because I would kill them.

The skilled victor does not **contend**;
Because I do not **contend**,
I can overcome their **contention**.
If all arise from **contention**,
then victory is not certain.

The skilled user of people places them below.
All people have the heart to **rise above others**,
so none can truly **use others**.
If one can truly **place them below**,
then all under heaven will **use me**.

This is called the **virtue/power of non-contention**,
This is called the **force of using people**,
This is called **aligning with Heaven’s ancient extreme**.

**Chapter Sixty-Nine: The Art of War**
In the art of war, there is a saying:
I do not dare to be the **host** but be the **guest**;
The **host** is the one who **initiates conflict**,
The **guest** is the one who **responds to conflict**.

I do not dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot;
Advancing is to have **intent to contend**,
Retreating is to have **no intent to contend**.

This is called **action without action**;
Without **intent to contend**,
even when wielding arms,
it is equal to not wielding them.

「Repel without arms, yet have no foes;
Seize without weapons.
If there is no intent to contend,
then even when in the military,
it is as though there were no arms to repel,
no foes to exploit,
no weapons to wield—
how then could there be fault in wielding arms?

No calamity is greater than underestimating an enemy;
one who underestimates an enemy nearly loses his **virtue/power**.
The Sage treasures **virtue/power** as his **treasure**—
to underestimate an enemy is to underestimate battle,
to underestimate battle is to underestimate killing,
and thus he loses what constitutes his **virtue/power**.

When armies clash,
the first to act is victorious.
When two enemies clash,
and I act only out of necessity,
then I have **compassion**.
When **compassion** is shown,
Heaven and humanity aid me—
even if I wish not to be victorious,
it cannot be avoided.

**Chapter Seventy: The Ease of My Words**
My words are very easy to know,
very easy to practice.
Yet none under heaven can know them,
none can practice them.

The **Dao** is vast—
to restore one’s **nature** is sufficient.
Yet the subtlety of **nature** is seen
in one’s daily actions, eating, and drinking.

The Sage points to this and shows it to people—
how could it not be easy to know?
If one can embody this to respond to things,
how could it not be easy to practice?

Yet the world often suffers from ignorance in daily life,
not knowing it—
and even if they know, they cannot practice it,
let alone act upon it.

Words have their **root**,
affairs have their **master**.
Only the ignorant fail to recognize me.
Words are the **trap** of the **Dao**,
affairs are the **traces** of the **Dao**.
If the **Dao** could be fully expressed in words,
then listening to words would suffice;
if it could be fully seen in affairs,
then examining affairs would suffice.
But since words cannot exhaust it,
and affairs cannot reveal it,
one must abandon words to seek their **root**,
and abandon affairs to seek their **master**—
otherwise, it cannot be attained.

Truly, the ancient Sages
had no thought, no action,
yet a **mysterious stillness** remained within them,
unaware of itself—
this is beyond the reach of thought and deliberation,
and thus none truly know me.

Few know me,
so I am precious.
What the masses can know
is not worth treasuring.

Thus the Sage wears coarse cloth while holding **jewel-like virtue**.
The Sage appears outwardly like others,
yet inwardly is entirely different.

**Chapter Seventy-One: Knowing the Unknown**
To know the unknown—
this is **supreme**;」

**Chapter Seventy-Two: Knowing the Unknown**

To know that one does not know—this is **illness**.
The Dao cannot be reached by thought and deliberation,
so it cannot be grasped.
Yet when one does not yet know,
there is no way to enter without knowing.
But once one knows and clings to that knowing,
then knowing becomes **illness**.
Thus, knowing while not knowing is **supreme**,
while not knowing while knowing is **illness**.

Only by **disease of disease** does one avoid disease.
It cannot be both unknown and known—
only by knowing that knowing is **illness**
does the disease, over time, depart.
The Sage does not fall ill,
for by **disease of disease**, one does not fall ill.

**Chapter Seventy-Two: The People Do Not Fear Authority**
If the people do not fear authority,
then **great authority** will arise.
Authority is inherent in nature—
elevated, luminous, vast, and resplendent,
soaring beyond all things—
this is what is called **great authority**.

Yet people are drowned in the crowd,
fearfully clinging to life and death,
dreading gain and loss.
The authority of all things presses upon them,
and they tremble their whole lives long,
never at ease—
though **great authority** stands before them,
they do not perceive it.

If one truly knows this,
and equalizes life and death,
gain and loss,
then, serene and unafraid,
**great authority** shines forth.

Do not confine your dwelling,
do not weary of your life.
Only by not wearying
does one not weary.
Nature’s grandeur
can embrace heaven and earth.
Yet those who do not know
clutch their limbs and orifices as their own,
hoarding them without wearying.
Thus, their vision does not extend beyond sight,
their hearing does not extend beyond sound—
how narrow and meager they are!
Therefore, it is taught: *Do not confine your dwelling.*

Those who know
realize the vastness of nature and the narrowness of life,
yet grow discontent, longing to escape but unable—
unaware that their discontent and longing
are bound by things.
Thus, it is taught: *Do not weary of your life.*

Only the Sage
does not confine nor weary,
sharing life with others
while dwelling with the Dao,
beyond distinctions of broad or narrow, pure or impure.
Having no weariness of life,
one then knows that life cannot be wearying.

Thus the Sage
knows himself but does not display himself,
loves himself but does not exalt himself—
lest others harbor weariness or longing.
As long as weariness and longing remain,
fear lingers.
Only when fear departs
does **great authority** manifest.

**Chapter Seventy-Three: Courage in Daring**
Courage in daring leads to death,
courage in not daring leads to life—
both may bring gain or harm.
What the heavens abhor—
who can fathom their reason?
Thus even the Sage finds it difficult.

Courage in daring brings death,
courage in not daring brings life—
this is the great constant of things.
Yet sometimes the daring live,
sometimes the timid die,
and the world, relying on chance,
overlooks the constant principle.

The heavens’ ways are distant—
who knows where their likes and dislikes originate?
Thus even the Sage takes the constant as true,
yet still hesitates over daring.

Liezi said:
*"To welcome the heavens’ intent,
to weigh gain and harm—
this is not as good as letting be."*

The difficulty of the heavens’ ways
is why they are laid out in detail.

The Dao of the heavens
conquers without contending—
not contending with things at a single moment,
yet assured of ultimate victory.
It responds without speaking—
how could the heavens speak?
The seasons pass in their course,
all things arise from it—
never has there been a request unanswered.
It summons without calling—
the divine response is beyond measure.
How much more so to summon by number?
Who could call it?

Yet it plans with ease.
Leisurely and relaxed,
as if pursuing nothing,
yet its plans surpass all others.

The heavenly net is vast—
though sparse, it loses nothing.
The world, observing the heavens with ears and eyes,
sees only a curve and misses the whole.
Some prosper through goodness, others suffer through evil—
how could one not doubt the net’s sparseness and its losses?
Only by grasping its beginning and end,
and exhausting its transformations,
does one know its vastness—
though sparse, it loses nothing.

**Chapter Seventy-Four: The People Do Not Fear Death**
The people do not ordinarily fear death—
how can you frighten them with death?
When governance is burdensome and punishments heavy,
the people have no recourse—
they do not fear death,
and even if you threaten them with death,
it avails nothing.

If you make the people constantly fear death,
and punish those who act strangely,
I will seize and kill them—
who would dare?
When the people are at ease under governance,
constantly cherishing life and fearing death,
then seizing those who deceive and disrupt the order to kill them—
who would not submit?

There are always those who execute the killing.
The executor of killing—
this is the heavens.
When the world is well-ordered,
and deceivers disrupt the order,
they are abandoned by the heavens.
If the heavens abandon them and I kill them,
then it is the heavens who kill them,
not I.

To act as the executor of killing
is to usurp the Great Carpenter’s judgment.
To usurp the Great Carpenter’s judgment
rarely fails to injure one’s hands.
To kill those not abandoned by the heavens
is to act as the executor of killing—
to usurp the Great Carpenter’s judgment,
then one’s hands are injured;
to act as the executor of killing,
then one’s own life is endangered.

**Chapter Seventy-Five: The People’s Hunger**
The people’s hunger
comes from their rulers taking too much in taxes.
The people’s difficulty in being governed
comes from their rulers’ excessive actions.
When rulers guide the people with their own actions,
the people respond in kind—
thus, affairs multiply and governance becomes difficult.

People grow indifferent to death
because life’s abundance makes them so.
When rulers prioritize profit and desire over the people,
the people compete to thicken their own lives—
thus, even in death, they relentlessly seek gain.

Only those who do not use life as a means
are superior to those who value life dearly.

---

**Chapter Seventy-Six: The People’s Way of Life**
The extreme reverence for life
leads to indifference toward death.
Only those who do not use life as a means
are those whose life is naturally preserved.

**Chapter Seventy-Six: The People’s Way of Life**
The people’s way of life is soft and yielding when they live,
but hard and strong when they die.
All things—grasses and trees—are soft and yielding when they live,
but withered and brittle when they die.
Thus, the hard and strong are the companions of death,
while the soft and yielding are the companions of life.
If **Daoist** *qi* is present within them,
then their bodies will know no ailment of hardness and strength;
if **Daoist** *principle* is present within them,
then their affairs will bear no burden of hardness and strength.
Hence, strong armies do not conquer,
for armies conquer through righteousness, not mere strength;
if strong yet unrighteous, their defeat will be swift.

Strong trees are felled.
Wood, once it reaches the height of its bowing branches,
must be cut down.
The strong are placed below,
the soft and yielding above.
The natural order of things:
the refined is above, the coarse below.
The refined must be soft and yielding,
the coarse must be strong and mighty.

**Chapter Seventy-Seven: The Dao of Heaven**
Heaven’s Dao—
is it not like drawing a bow?
When a bow is drawn, its upper back bends;
when it is released, its upper angle rises—
thus, Heaven is likened to suppressing the high and elevating the low.
The high are suppressed,
the low are raised,
those with excess are diminished,
those lacking are supplemented.
Heaven’s Dao: diminishes excess and supplements deficiency;
human Dao is otherwise: diminishes deficiency to honor excess.
Heaven acts without partiality,
thus it is balanced;
humans act with partiality,
thus they are unbalanced.
Who can diminish excess to benefit all under Heaven?
Only those who follow the Dao.
Those who follow the Dao give to all without complaint,
and the more they give, the more they possess;
the more they bestow, the more they have.
None but those who follow the Dao can bear this.
Hence, the Sage acts but does not claim credit,
achieves but does not dwell upon it—
for he does not wish to be seen as virtuous.
If he acts yet relies upon it,
and achieves yet dwells upon it,
then he will be seen as virtuous in the world.
When he is seen as virtuous in the world,
this is the act of honoring excess with himself.

**Chapter Seventy-Eight: The Softness of All Under Heaven**
Nothing under Heaven is softer or weaker than water,
yet nothing can surpass it in overcoming hardness and strength—
its power cannot be replaced.
Thus, softness overcomes hardness,
weakness overcomes strength—
all under Heaven knows this,
yet few can practice it.
Hence, the Sage says:
To bear the filth of the state,
this is called the steward of the soil and grain;
to bear the ill omens of the state,
this is called the ruler of all under Heaven.
Right speech as if reversed.
Right speech aligns with the Dao yet opposes common custom,
for the common folk regard bearing filth as shame,
and bearing ill omens as calamity.

**Chapter Seventy-Nine: Reconciling Great Grievances**
To reconcile great grievances,
there must always be lingering resentment—
how can this be considered good?
Grievances arise from delusion,
and delusion stems from human nature.
Those who understand human nature
do not see delusion manifest,
and thus, what grievance is there?
Now, if one does not remove the root,
yet seeks to reconcile the branches,
then though the surface may seem reconciled,
the resentment within remains unvanquished.
Hence, the Sage holds the left half of the contract,
and does not demand it of others.
Thus, those with **virtue/power** oversee the contract,
while those without oversee it to its end.
The contract’s left and right halves
are meant to establish trust and deter disputes.
The Sage shares this human nature with all,
yet people regard delusion as the norm,
and indulge in the field of contention and rivalry,
unaware that their nature has never truly diminished.
Hence, the Sage reveals their nature to others,
urging them to remove delusion and return to their true nature.
When delusion is exhausted and true nature restored,
none fail to find themselves in harmony,
like the right half of the contract meeting the left—
no demand is needed before the service is fulfilled.
Yet even with great grievances and lingering resentments,
they will melt away like ice in spring,
knowing that their root was never truly present—
why then use reconciliation?
Those without **virtue/power**,
who wish to make all conform,
will only labor in vain.

Laozi was born in the declining Zhou, when culture flourished yet customs decayed, and sought to remedy this with *wuwei* (non-action). Thus, at the end of his book, he expresses his aspiration—wishing to test his vision in a realm of *xiaoguo guamin* (small states, few people)—though such a place was unattainable.

Let the people possess tenfold or hundredfold tools yet not employ them. Let each abide in their allotted station, then even those in modest villages will not seek to serve the world. The tenfold or hundredfold tools refer to those whose wealth suffices to support a superior of ten, hundred, or thousand households. Though carriages and chariots exist, there will be none to ride them; though armor and weapons exist, there will be none to array them. Let the people return to knotted cords for their needs. With few demands and simple folk, even knotted cords suffice.

Let them find their food sweet, their garments fine, their dwellings secure, and their customs joyous. With inner sufficiency and no external cravings, they will regard what they possess as beauty and their dwelling as delight, seeking nothing further. Neighboring lands lie in sight, the sounds of roosters and dogs heard between them, yet the people will pass their days to old age without visiting one another. When the multitude of things and people do not vie for one another, each finds sufficiency in themselves.

**Chapter 80: "The Blind Do Not Admire Beauty"**
*"True speech is not adorned; adorned speech is not true.*
True speech is substance alone—no need for embellishment.
Adorned speech is mere spectacle—no need for truth.
The virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.
Prioritizing virtue, one need not prove oneself.
Prioritizing argument, one may not be virtuous.
The wise are not erudite; the erudite are not wise.
With one thread to bind all, there is no need for vast learning.
To study and grow daily does not guarantee the Dao.
The Sage accumulates nothing—
The more they give to others, the more they possess;
The more they bestow, the more they have.

The Sage holds fast to *One* alone, accumulating nothing else.
Yet they deploy their abilities for others,
extend their possessions to others—
When others are exhausted but *One* remains inexhaustible,
then one knows the value of *One*.

The Dao of Heaven benefits without harming;
The Dao of the Sage acts without contending.
What can benefit may also harm;
What can act may also contend.
Yet the Sage, though capable of benefit and harm, never harms;
Though capable of action and contention, never contends—
Thus, Heaven and the Sage surpass all others,
becoming the root from which all things stem.

All this is what Laozi wrote and the broad outline of his Dao.
Hence, he reiterates it at the book’s close.

**Postscript by Su Shi of Elline Hill (Mountain of Bamboo):**
At forty-two years of age, I was exiled to Junzhou.

The state of Jun may be small, yet it boasts many ancient Buddhist monasteries, where monks from all directions gather.

There was a Daoist named Quanzhen residing on Mount Huangman, the grandson of Nan Gong. His conduct was noble and his mind profound, and he took pleasure in conversing with me on the Dao. I told him:

*"What you speak of, I have already found in the Confucian texts."*

Quanzhen replied: *"This is the Buddha’s teaching—how could a Confucian have attained it?"*

I said: *"Not so. I have heard the Dao, which Confucians do not possess—why forcefully accuse them of it? Truly, it exists, though the world knows it not."*

Quanzhen pressed: *"The separation between Confucianism and Buddhism is as vast as that between the Hu and Han peoples—how then do you claim to know it? Speak briefly of its essence."*

I answered: *"The grandson of Confucius, Zisi, wrote *The Doctrine of the Mean*. Within it, he says:

*'Before joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise, this is called the *zhong* [centrality].
When they arise yet remain measured, this is called *he* [harmony].
*Zhong* is the great root of all under Heaven;
*He* is the universal Way of all under Heaven.
To attain *zhong* and *he*, Heaven and Earth find their place, and all things flourish.
Is this not the Buddha’s teaching? Only the path of discourse differs.'"*

Quanzhen asked: *"How do you explain this?"*

I replied: *"The Sixth Patriarch said: ‘Do not dwell on goodness, nor dwell on evil—only then do you glimpse your original face. Since the Sixth Patriarch, half of those who attained enlightenment through these words have done so.’*

What is meant by ‘not dwelling on goodness, nor dwelling on evil’ is precisely the state where joy, anger, sorrow, and delight have not yet arisen.

Indeed, *zhong* [centrality] is but another name for the Buddha-nature;
while *he* [harmony] encompasses the six perfections and myriad practices.

To attain the utmost *zhong* and *he*, Heaven and Earth take their place, and all things flourish within—what else could this be but the Buddha’s teaching?

Quanzhen, astonished and delighted, exclaimed: *"I never knew this before! Only now do I realize that Confucianism and Buddhism are one in essence."*

I laughed and said: *"Not so. Though there is but one Way under Heaven, the means of governing people differ. Between ruler and subject, parent and child, without ritual and law, there is only chaos. To know ritual and law yet ignore the Way—that is the common scholar, unworthy of praise.

To dwell in mountains and forests, eating coarse food and drinking from streams, yet harboring the supreme Dao—one might become a teacher of gods and humans. But to govern the world with such a path would bring disorder.

The ancient sages held the Dao in their hearts and practiced it, yet did not reject the laws of the world—only then could they succeed."*

Quanzhen bowed in reverence and said: *"This is profound discourse!"*

At that time, I was expounding the *Laozi*, and whenever I completed a chapter, I showed it to Quanzhen. He would always sigh and say: *"All of this is the Buddha’s teaching."*

I stayed in Jun for five years before returning north. Quanzhen passed away not long after. Twenty years have now passed since then.

Whenever I revised *The Explanation of the Laozi*, I never found anything that did not align with the Buddha’s teaching.

Since there are no others with whom I can converse, I long to see Quanzhen again to show him these words, so I have appended them to the end of *The Laozi*.

Written on the tenth day of the twelfth month, the second year of the *Daguan* era, by Zi Xiang.
