**Preface to the Commentary on the Scripture of Prolonging Life through the Northern Dipper**

Of old, before the Great Simplicity divided, there was neither light nor form. The undifferentiated yellow evolved into transformation, having beginning and end. Thus, the pure ascends while the turbid lingers; goodness is aided while evil is suppressed. A hundred and twenty bureaus were established and arrayed in the netherworld. Thirty-six scriptures were composed and concealed in the Jasper Palace, to deliver those of the Dao among heavenly beings and enlighten the unenlightened among sentient beings. I sigh and say: Is this not the guiding principle of the Three Realms and Ten Directions, the order of Heaven, Earth, and humanity?

Now, in this sagely age, we are blessed with abundant years and have encountered the imperial dynasty, which governs the realm with virtue and pacifies the household, achieving illustrious merit and nurturing the common people. Moreover, the world is at peace, and the Supreme Mystery shines forth. Thus, those of Daoist aspiration—such as the disciples of the Feng clan—renew their vows daily, longing for the truth through the years. They pray to Heaven for protection against malevolent forces and seek the teachings of masters to transmit the essentials of the Dao. Thereupon, they encountered the Perfected One of Mystic Origin of Mount Kongtong, who elucidated the mysterious texts of the Dragon Han era and expounded the wondrous subtleties of the Red Brightness. He taught the talismans of the Ten Caves and the Three Vehicles, transforming the myriad mechanisms into a single principle. He composed a commentary on *The Scripture of Prolonging Life through the Northern Dipper*, which, in its highest aspect, enables the spirit to ascend to the Golden Gates; in its middle aspect, protects the state and secures the household; and in its lower aspect, prolongs life and extends longevity. It universally delivers all sentient beings, guiding them together through the barrierless gate. Therefore, I respectfully compose this text to preface the scripture.

*Respectfully composed by Li Bai.*

**Commentary and Verses on the Supreme Mysterious Numinous Original Destiny Life-Prolonging Perfected Scripture, Fascicle One**
*By the Perfected One of Mystic Origin of Mount Kongtong*

"Supreme" (*Tai*) signifies the ultimate; "High" (*Shang*) signifies loftiness. "Mysterious" (*Xuan*) signifies profound remoteness; "Numinous" (*Ling*) signifies divine efficacy. The "Northern Dipper" (*Beidou*) is the pivotal mechanism of celestial movement. "Original Destiny" (*Benming*) is the inherent nature from the origin. "Prolonging Life" (*Yansheng*) is enduring existence without decay. "Perfected Scripture" (*Zhenjing*) is the path leading to the attainment of true subtlety.

○ The great assembly of sagely and perfected heavenly beings imparts teachings to guide and transform the world. Whether one’s fate is prosperous or adverse, the ultimate goal is non-action. Internally, one harmonizes the central equilibrium; externally, one aligns with the pivotal mechanism. Through transformation, one ascends in flight to wander and feast in the Jade Capital. Yet how is it that worldly people remain deluded by the true Dao, indulging in greed, wrath, and ignorance, giving rise to the three karmic actions and stirring the six sensory faculties?

The "three karmic actions" are greed, wrath, and ignorance. The "six sensory faculties" are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. Once the three karmic actions arise, the six faculties generate obstructions. With obstructions, afflictions arise. With afflictions, myriad entanglements ensue, turning one away from the true purpose. The mind-horse runs wild, the heart-ape dashes in frenzy, scattering and losing the numinous source, corrupting and destroying the true *qi*. Sins accumulate like mountains, while good deeds are as fleeting as dust or dew. The Southern Asterism shortens one’s allotted lifespan, the Northern Dipper erases one’s years. Upon death, one enters Fengdu, enduring every torment: sword trees, blade mountains, cauldrons of boiling water, furnaces of burning coals, unceasing torture, endless wailing. Kin and relatives weep in vain, while one alone suffers in desolation. Even if one were a high-ranking noble or a wealthy lord, what benefit is there in the end? How can one discern the turbid from the clear, embrace the true, and return to the One?

**Verse:**
The Supreme Perfected Teachings deliver the deluded world,
Breaking from evil, returning to rectitude, and abstaining from greed, wrath, and ignorance.

Fleeting worldly ties bring no true joy,
Yet the primal homeland’s scenes are most wondrous.
A few wisps of dawn mist drift across distant ridges,
A sliver of slanting moon illumines the cold pond.

To know the principle of extending life in one’s original destiny,
Awaken to the mystery of the primal creative mechanism.

At that time, the Most High Lord Lao, in the first year of *Yongshou*, on the seventh day of the first month, was in the Supreme Ultimate Palace within the Great Clarity Realm.
That time—this very moment.
The Most High Lord Lao—ancestor of Heaven and Earth, origin of the myriad dharmas, whose sacred virtue towers beyond measure.
The first year of *Yongshou*, the seventh day of the first month—within the boundless void, where kalpas endure without end, cycles defy numbering, yet we force them into calendric names.
In the Great Clarity Realm, within the Supreme Ultimate Palace—realm of carefree wandering, land of spontaneous freedom, where jade halls rise in majesty, towers of jasper soar in splendor, gold and jade gleam resplendent, and radiant clouds stream with light.

Thus did the Most High Lord Lao dwell in his abode, attended by the myriad spirits. Yet worldly beings know only that the Most High Lord Lao resides above the azure vault, unaware that he abides within the human body itself. Hence it is said: the Three Clarities are within oneself—why seek them without?

**Verse:**
The Great Dao’s subtlety defies all probing,
Yet within it lies the profound mystery of wondrous workings.
Why search beyond the clouds for true awakening?
Seek but the ancestral wind within your own body.
Recognize the path from which you came of old,
And let flowers and trees grow as they will.
To cultivate without grasping this principle
Is like scooping water to summon the toad—utterly in vain.

Beholding sentient beings adrift for kalpas unending,
Trapped in the cycles of birth and death:
All beings are originally of one work with Heaven and Earth,
Of one substance with sages and worthies.
Awakened, they become sages;
Deluded, they are but ordinary mortals.

**O assembly!** Those who awaken awaken to the wondrous function of the true and constant,
Seizing the transformations of Heaven and Earth.
They preserve their true nature and nurture their essence,
Refine their souls and clarify their spirits,
Empty their minds that intent may be at peace,
Cut off their desires that their spirits may be clear.
Unattached to the myriad things in their single mind,
Their flawless practice reaches completion, their work is done.
They abide in effortless spontaneity,
Carefree beyond the realm of things.

The deluded are deluded in their true awakened nature.
Relying on the harmonious *qi* of their parents’ union,
Entrusted to the generative essence of yin and yang,
They enter the womb as a borrowed form.
When their *qi* is full and their form complete,
After ten months, they are born as human beings.
Then, receiving the four elements and five aggregates,
Their illusory, impermanent bodies take shape.
Scarcely do they discern east from west,
Gradually distinguishing south from north,
When their eyes already behold perverse sights,
Their ears hear perverse sounds,
Their tongues savor perverse flavors,
Their noses smell perverse fragrances.
Their minds crave and cling to desires,
Their hearts arise in love and aversion.
In action, they spawn right and wrong;
In movement, they generate crookedness and obscurity.
Planting the roots of all evils,
They receive retribution in the three evil destinies,
Adrift for kalpas unending,
Trapped in the wheel of birth and death.

Thus did the Most High Lord Lao manifest his great divine power,
His eyes radiating the light of great spiritual penetration.
Beholding sentient beings drifting in the cycle of birth and death without end,
He was moved by compassion and broadly bestowed the true teachings,
Making them the boat and oar to ferry the world,
That beings might awaken to the formless form,
Recognize the formless form,
And thereby attain long life and spontaneous freedom,
Forever ceasing their wanderings in the wheel of rebirth.

**Verse:**
Our original countenance—how could it be lost?
Only through greed and delusion do we enter dreams again and again.
Fortunate that the celestial realm contains chaos,
Yet how can we bear to let the mind-ground sprout dust and defilement?
Within being and non-being, seek the illusory and false;
Amidst emptiness and form, find the true and real.
Return to the homeland where the scenery is fine—
Wildflowers, singing birds, and willows in spring.

Some dwell in the human realm,
Some in the Middle Kingdom,
Some among the barbarian tribes,
Some within savage lands.
Some are rich, some noble,
Some lowly, some poor.
For a time, by karmic conditions,
They fall into hell.

For sentient beings, according to their karmic deeds,
Receive rebirth in accord with their fruits:
Some are born in the Middle Kingdom,
Some among barbarians,
Some in the households of the wealthy and noble,
Some in the homes of the poor and lowly.
Having briefly attained human form,
Many follow their desires,
Unaware and unknowing,
Indulging their passions and committing transgressions,
Recklessly acting wrongly.
The Three Corpses fully orchestrate their downfall,
The Six Bandits freely incite their cunning.
**O assembly!** Greedy for wealth and lustful for beauty,
Their words belie their hearts.
Jealous of the capable, they ruin the worthy;
They deceive Heaven and Earth.
Disloyal and unfilial,
Dishonest and untrustworthy,
They harm the good and virtuous,
Oppress the kind and gentle.
Violating Heaven and Earth’s prohibitions,
Defying the statutes of true sages,
They plunder nests and break eggs,
Slaying and harming sentient beings.
Committing all manner of sins and transgressions,
They never reflect upon themselves.
The thirty-six thousand spirits within their bodies
Transform into eighty-four thousand dust-like afflictions and karmic deeds.
The fire of calamity burns their bodies, leaving no escape.
The four elements and five aggregates scatter with earth, water, fire, and wind,
Leaving only their lonely, wandering souls—
For in their days of fleeting karmic conditions,
Clinging and deluded, they failed to awaken,
Falling into the Avīci Hell.
How could they not know sorrow?

Yet humans possess a dignified six-foot frame,
Washing and adorning it,
Dressing in fine silks and splendid attire,
Cherishing their bodies.
Who among them is willing to preserve their true nature, nurture their lives,
Refine their essence, and store their spirits?
Thus does the Heavenly Worthy bestow his scriptures and dharmas,
Guiding sentient beings,
Swiftly enabling them to suddenly comprehend,
And awaken to the wondrous mystery of non-action.

**Verse:**
In the celestial realm, spring days are longest,
Rain-cleared skies, warm mist, and radiant winds.

Alas, the swallows return to splendid halls,
Yet mock the wandering bees that chase faint fragrance.
Graceful blossoms brighten the small garden,
Tender willows sway, brushing the winding pond.

How lamentable—countless scenes of fleeting spring,
Butterflies dance, bees roam, their wings wild with play.
Yet for want of constancy, karmic bonds entangle,
Souls bound to the nether courts, suffering until their debt is paid.
When human destiny is forsaken,
They are reborn among beasts or fowl and insects,
Turning from the human Way, their human form lost.
Thus sunk in delusion, they know not their plight,
For past lives’ delusion of truth brings this cycle of rebirth.

Now, heaven and hell lie in human conduct alone.
Thus it is said: good and evil have no gate—
Only humans summon them.
If one accumulates goodness in life,
Heaven and earth shelter them, sun and moon shine upon them,
Ghosts and spirits revere them, true sages guard their door.
With such divine protection,
Fortune and blessings gather near, calamity and misfortune flee far,
And they become the wise, their names inscribed in Jade Clarity.

O assembly! Among all things, humans are most noble—
Why are humans most noble?
They seize the mechanism of heaven and earth,
Fathom the principles of yin and yang,
Plumb the obscure, probe the profound,
Guide and realize the true principle.
Only humans may attain the Dao and ascend as immortals.

Yet humans, unaware of the sage within,
Indulge in reckless folly,
Letting the six desires and seven emotions run wild,
Committing the ten evils and five rebellions,
Disrespecting the Three Luminaries,
Dishonoring the nine ancestors.
Day by day, month by month, sins pile like mountains,
Souls bound to the nether courts, enduring every torment,
Unceasing through day and night,
Dying a thousand deaths, reborn a myriad times,
With no escape,
Until their suffering is complete,
Only then briefly released—
Yet they fall into the realm of hungry ghosts,
Or among beasts: camels, mules, elephants, horses, birds, and insects.
Thus sunk in delusion, they forever lose their human form.

Alas!
For delusion brings no benefit, madness serves no purpose,
Thus they cast aside true suchness and cling to mere husks.

**Verse:**
Only for aimless folly, wisdom too dull,
Their souls are bound to Fengdu’s halls.
The nether officials interrogate, leaving them choked with grief,
Jailers torment, forcing sighs and groans.
Though briefly freed from the underworld,
They stray from the old path, taking on new forms.
Pity them, trapped among beasts—
To regain a human body would take ten thousand kalpas.

With a heart of compassion, the Heavenly Worthy divides his form to teach and transform,
His emanation descending to the capital of Shu.
Earth spirits surge forth, raising a jade platform to serve as his lofty seat.
For the Heavenly Worthy, sighing over sentient beings adrift in the six destinies,
Receiving retribution in the three paths,
Divides his form to teach and transform,
His emanation descending to the capital of Shu.
At that time, sun and moon ceased their turning,
Stars halted their wheels,
Heaven and earth grew solemn and still,
Rivers and seas calmed.
Thus did earth spirits surge forth, raising a jade platform to serve as his lofty seat.

O assembly! What is the meaning of this?
For there are no faultless sages, nor faultless ordinary beings.
By manifesting great divine power,
He prevents sentient beings from planting karmic roots,
Awakening them to the great Dao.
Yet the great Dao is formless and nameless,
Beyond all comparison, difficult to describe—
Thus he establishes this expedient teaching.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate once said in verse:
Though the great Dao has no heart,
It may be sought through compassion.
Thus, with a heart of compassion, he divides his form to teach and transform—
For if sentient beings can arouse a heart of compassion, this is it.

O assembly! How can it be said that the Heavenly Worthy is none other than sentient beings?
Though a nation has laws, transgression brings punishment to the body;
Yet if one is without fault, how could punishment cling to them?
If one reflects on wrongs and reforms,
Ceasing to create transgressions,
Then no calamity will approach—
Is this not so?

Thus the *Scripture of Salvation* says:
If you do not delight in the immortal Dao,
How can you escape the three realms?
If you wish to turn through the five destinies,
What can I do for you?

As for Shu Capital—if we speak in worldly terms, it was once the dwelling place of emperors, the ancestral root of mountains and rivers, the guiding principle of the cosmos, revolving through the world, transforming like fish and dragons; such was it when it served as the imperial seat.

If we speak in Daoist terms, Shu Capital is none other than the body and heart. Thus the *Nine Elders’ Treatise on Gathering the Real* says:
*"The wind and moon of Great Peace grace the imperial capital,
All nations come to pay homage to the Sage’s grace."*

The heart is likened to the emperor, the body to Shu Capital. When the heart is upright, the hundred bones rejoice, the myriad spirits harmonize and flourish. When the heart is perverse, the Three Corpses seize life, the Six Thieves deceive the public, calamity befalls the body, and one drifts endlessly through the wheel of rebirth.

The earth spirits surging forth represent the arising of intention from the mind-ground. The single jade platform is the precious throne of the celestial perfected. If one can arouse the heart and establish intention, refrain from perverse views, and avoid planting the seeds of transgression, then by seeking the gate of the great Dao and suddenly awakening to the nature of non-action, one will not be deluded by the faults of the six desires, attain the rank of the Ten Flowers, wander freely beyond the mundane, and merge with the Real.

A verse says:
Do not block the azure heavens’ path, nor deem it impassable;
This illusory body—know it turns to emptiness in an instant.
Cease idle talk of grasping profound principles,
For without true sincerity, all efforts are in vain.
Strike boldly open the gate of life and death,
Let the hero leap free from the dragon of bondage.
Wandering beyond the mundane as a guest of non-action,
Sun and moon are seized and held within your grasp.

Thereupon, the Lord Lao ascended the Jade Platform to sit, bestowing upon the Heavenly Master the *Northern Dipper Life-Span Scripture and Oral Instructions*, broadly proclaiming essential methods to universally deliver sentient beings.

At that time, the Most High Lord Lao ascended the Jade Platform and expounded the teachings of the Three Vehicles, revealing the wondrous principles of the Northern Dipper’s life-prolonging essence. He bestowed these upon the Heavenly Master to transform and enlighten all beings, that all might awaken to the Dao.

O assembly! Sentient beings indulge their seven emotions, incurring transgressions and thus hells; they covet the five desires, lacking wondrous fruits and thus no heavens. Unaware, they wallow in the Three Poisons and Ten Evils, drowning in the river of love, drifting through the cycle of birth and death.

Therefore, the Most High expounded this true scripture to guide the world, that people might not generate perverse views. In the intervals between dawn and dusk, regardless of others’ faults, one should constantly examine one’s own errors, temper sharp words with restraint, and repent accordingly. Using the Dharma-water to wash away worldly toil, polishing the precious mirror to illuminate this self, one purifies body and heart, embodying the function of the Dao. The primordial spirit dwells in the cinnabar palace, the light of wisdom shines upon the Jade Mountain. The Four Great Elements are at peace, the hundred bones naturally ordered. Within and without, emptiness and clarity; above and below, stillness and illumination. Yin and yang unite in intercourse, their movement endless. Merging into a single qi, refining the great elixir, one transforms, ascends in flight—profound beyond all reckoning.

When the ordinary form thus embodies the function of the Dao,
Even sacred works need not be feared as unattainable.

A verse says:

When the elixir-body is refined, it becomes naturally so,
Beyond the round and penetrating, one glimpses the paradise within the pot.
Fame and profit are but affairs of others’ households,
Virtue and power are all for my own karmic conditions.

When the wind stills and rain clears, waves ripple emerald,
When mist disperses and clouds scatter, the moon’s radiance is fair.
In stillness, one beholds the adorned realm,
Each thing, each head—profound, ever more profound.

At this time, the Elder Lord addressed the Heavenly Master, saying: “The human body is hard to obtain, birth in the Middle Land is hard to attain. Even if one attains birth, the true Dharma is hard to encounter. Reflecting upon the cycles of birth and death, within the wombs of womb-born, egg-born, moisture-born, and transformation-born beings—whether in deep mountains or desolate wilds, whether dwelling among grasses and trees or in rivers and streams—pigs, dogs, oxen, horses, donkeys, mules, and other beasts of burden; venomous insects and fierce beasts, tigers, leopards, jackals, and wolves; shrimp, crabs, fish, turtles, and all aquatic creatures; birds, beasts, and flying fowl; the myriad forms of the six livestock and all feathered kinds; every sort of secondary-born being—boundless and immeasurable, how can their numbers be known? Compared to such creatures, humans are as one in ten thousand.

Alas! The multitude squanders and ruins what is not theirs. Even if one attains a human body, to be born among the barbarians beyond civilization is still a transgression. Dwelling in such lands, have you ever heard of the country called Boye beyond the Northern Sea? In that land, people dwell in mountains in summer and hide in caves in winter. Desolate grasses stretch endlessly, yellow winds sweep the earth, and they clothe themselves in leaves and fur. Hunger is sated with birds and insects, neither benevolence nor righteousness is known, nor is there any understanding of virtue and power. They indulge their desires, commit wrongs, and transgress, making it difficult to ascend the immortal’s ranks and easy to sink into the ghostly realms.

Now that you dwell in a land where the Three Teachings flow and the Five Constants govern, born as humans in the Middle Land—is this not the result of accumulated virtue? Yet even among those born in the Middle Land, many cling to perverse views, fail to encounter the true Dharma, boast of their own cleverness, vaunt their superiority, falsely claim mastery of the mysterious gate, and misinterpret the scriptures and laws. Thus deluded, they cannot perceive the Dao.

Failing to recognize the true principles of the Three Teachings,
One comes to this dusty world in vain.

A verse says:
The cycles of the Six Paths—alas, how lamentable!
Yet within the square inch of the heart, apply your effort.
When the playful monkey is let loose, a thousand things arise,
But when the inferior horse is tamed, not half remains.
The mundane scene blends like the autumn night’s moon,
Root and dust are entrusted to the jade-green pot.
The homeland is but a footstep away, the scenery fair—
With a sweep of the sleeve, laugh and stride the level path.

Many are deluded by the true Dao, many enter perverse sects,
Many plant the roots of sin, many practice cunning deceit,
Many indulge in lust and killing, many favor worldly attachments,
Many give rein to greed and wrath, many sink into hell,
Many lose the human form.

Such are the conditions of sentient beings who do not awaken, who know not the true Dao, and whose delusions are many. For their good roots are shallow, their wisdom dim and turbid. They refuse loyalty to their lord, filial piety to their parents; the poor do not keep to their station, the rich do not bestow their grace. They seek no good, aid not the distressed, scorn the Three Luminaries, and waste the Five Grains. They plunge into the bitter sea of craving for wealth and lust, toiling endlessly in the cage of strife for fame and gain. They disbelieve in karma, hoard with stinginess, seethe with envy, slaughter creatures, feast on dogs and swine, sever lives to clog their own flesh with pus. Relying on power and might, they bully the lowly, devour flesh and blood, spew filthy words, gossip and slander, stir dualistic views. When they encounter fasts and offerings, they harbor destructive thoughts; when they see true cultivators, they foster disbelief. Countless are their delusions, their wisdom obscured. Many sink into hell, many lose the human form, failing to see the true Dao and entering only perverse sects.

Alas, how may the multitude perceive the true Dao?
Do not cling to sound, scent, taste, touch, or dharmas;
Do not give rise to stinginess, greed, killing, theft, or lust.
Awaken great wisdom, purify body and heart,
Inwardly observe the six roots, the Four Great Elements, the five viscera, and the hundred spirits.
By what do these forms move? By what do they speak?
When a single breath does not come, the Four Great Elements suddenly cease.

A verse says:
Within the body, the subtle and mysterious lie clearly revealed—
Do not give rise to stinginess or greed, nor be deluded by phenomena.
When the great Dao is awakened, true joy arises,
But when worldly affairs are discerned, only sorrow remains.
Do not indulge in turbidity and wallow in evils,
But purify the heart and transform the Five Decays.
When spirit and nature are free of dust and defilement,
Heaven and earth expand to reveal the numinous foundation.

Now, moved by pity for these sentient beings,
I set forth the teachings and expound the good conditions,
That they may know the Dao, know the nature and life of the body,
All of which depend on the Dao for their arising.

Moreover, the sages established the teachings in myriad ways,
Adapting their methods to the capacities of beings,
Setting forth laws to deliver them,
That all sentient beings might awaken to the great Dao
And know that heaven, earth, and the myriad things all depend on the Dao for their arising.

For the great Dao arises from non-being into being,
And from non-nothingness into nothingness—
Truly, it is hard to speak of!

When heaven and earth were formless,
At the time when the clear and turbid had not yet separated,
Vast and obscure, dim and silent,
It could not be heard, nor could it be seen.
In the midst of the indistinct and vague,
The Five Ultimates arose.
When the kalpas of the Five Ultimates ended,
A single qi congealed, transforming into chaos.
After ninety thousand kalpas,
Gradually, the mysterious and the yellow emerged.
Then, the Primordial Sovereign nurtured essence and cultivated qi to perfection,
Bursting open the chaos.
The two qi subtly divided,
The Three Powers began to take form.
The clear qi congealed and floated upward to become heaven,
The turbid qi settled and sank downward to become earth.
The sun, moon, stars, and constellations were arrayed,
Mountains, rivers, seas, and peaks were established.
Cold and heat shifted, yin and yang ascended and descended,
And the myriad things were born—
None apart from the great Dao.

Thus the *Scripture of Purity* says:
“The great Dao has no name, yet it gives birth to heaven and earth;
The great Dao has no form, yet it nurtures the myriad things.”

Yet heaven and earth are but the offspring of the Dao,
The sun and moon its grandchildren.
Heaven and earth cannot form without essence and qi,
The sun and moon cannot shine without essence and qi.
Grasses and trees wither when deprived of essence and qi,
The human form perishes when essence and qi are exhausted.

Thus, humanity is never far from the Dao,
And the Dao never departs from humanity—
For the human body embraces the Dao,
And shares the same substance as heaven and earth.
Those who seek to cultivate the true must wield heaven’s function,
And thereby align with the Dao to achieve perfection.

As the *Scripture of Yin Conformity* states:
“Observe heaven’s Dao, grasp heaven’s workings—
This is all there is to it.”

For those who study the Dao,
Simply observing heaven’s function and grasping its workings is sufficient.
Refine the yin soul to transform it into yang spirit,
Exchange the mortal frame for an immortal body.

A verse says:
Comprehending the origins of the myriad dharmas,
One radiates silent illumination, stirring the profound mystery.
The Five Agents emerge blended within the crucible’s scene,
The Seven Returns refine a realm beyond all form.
The golden crow soars in silence to the crimson palace,
The jade hare endlessly plays in the moon’s luminous glow.
Who knows this true message?
Without encountering an extraordinary person, it cannot be transmitted.

Awakening to this cause,
One attains long life within the human realm,
The seed is never severed,
And generation after generation, one remains human—
Never born in a land devoid of the Dao,
Never cut off from the root of humanity.

If one can arouse the mind of supreme goodness,
Uproot all evil tendencies,
Eradicate the divisions of self and other,
Fill the pit of desire and love,
Instantly break free from the bonds of confinement,
Dispel the mind of leakage and defilement,
And awaken to the nature of non-action—
How joyful indeed!

When the assembly awakens to the great Dao,
What wondrous fruits will they attain?
Without enduring suffering or entering hell,
A hundred blessings will silently gather,
A thousand calamities will vanish.
All aspirations will be fulfilled,
Clothing and sustenance will come naturally,
Longevity will be extended,
And one will dwell in peace within a joyful land.

Thus the *Scripture of Purity* says:
“The superior person, awakening to it, ascends to the celestial offices;
The middling person, awakening to it, ranks among the immortals of the Southern Palace;
The lesser person, cultivating it, enjoys long life in the world.”

Yet if sentient beings plant the seeds of evil,
They will not reap blessings;
If they cultivate goodness,
They will not incur misfortune.
For instance, if one attains great insight,
Suddenly awakens to understanding,
Contemplates the true and invokes the sacred,
Purifies the defiled and clarifies the mind—
The supreme benefit will be obtained,
And none can usurp what you alone enjoy.
Have you planted the seeds of good deeds?
For the accumulation of goodness yields good fruits,
While the practice of evil brings evil retribution.

As the *Scripture of the Chapter on Generating the Spirit* states:
“Good and evil deeds, even by a hair’s breadth, are never lost.”

Across past, present, and future lives—
The three times—
And among the four births (womb, egg, moisture, transformation) and six destinies,
The realms of wealth and poverty,
Wisdom and foolishness, high and low status,
Hungry ghosts, animals, camels, mules, elephants, horses,
Hell and heaven—
All arise from the deeds one has accumulated.

Thus the Confucian texts say:
“The family that accumulates goodness will have abundant blessings,
While the family that accumulates evil will surely face lingering misfortune.”

Reflect well: cleanse the heart and turn toward goodness,
Contemplate the causes of sin and fortune,
The retribution of good and evil—
Like a shadow following form,
Like an echo responding to sound.

Alas! Do not harbor crooked thoughts or perverse views,
Do not harm others for personal gain,
Do not slander or envy the worthy and good,
Do not entangle yourself in grievances and burdens.
Instead, blend with the world, harmonize with its dust,
Act in accordance with righteousness and measure your strength,
Build merit as opportunities arise,
Practice the Dao with constant expedience,
Relieve others and bestow kindness.
Then, naturally,
Heaven will cover you,
Earth will bear you,
The sun and moon will illuminate you,
And ghosts and spirits will revere you.
You will never be born in a land devoid of the Dao,
Nor will you ever sever the root of humanity.

Hah!
Wield wisdom’s hand to seize the dragon,
Shatter the primordial chaos of the heart!

A verse says:

Who can suddenly awaken to the subtle mysteries of the profound,
Yearning for the abstruse to grasp the wondrous mechanism?
Only then will you trust that chrysanthemums bloom as wild geese scatter in disarray,
And know that willows darken as dancing bees grow sparse.
Falling flowers and flowing waters—vanity’s fleeting dream,
Wild birds and solitary clouds—truly dependable.
This secluded dwelling urges early enlightenment;
Beyond the green mountain gate, auspicious clouds take flight.

Further refine the heart in the upright Dao,
Gradually enter the immortal lineage,
Forever escape the wheel of rebirth,
And ascend to transcendence.

Yet all beings must constantly restrain the self,
Act with impartiality,
Filial piety toward parents,
Loyalty to the sovereign,
Reverence for Heaven, Earth, and the Three Luminaries,
Deference to the sages of past and present,
Temperance, prudence, humility, and modesty.
Moreover, purify the heart,
Refine nature amid the six desires,
Transcend the five turbidities,
Quell the mind to nurture wisdom,
Conceal traces and veil radiance,
Externally cleanse the dust,
Internally preserve the spirit,
Seize the golden elixir from the jade spring,
Battle the dragon and tiger in the alchemical crucible.
Divine water irrigates the yellow sprout—all passages open,
The goat-drawn carriage bears the numinous essence—all spirits rejoice.
Purify the form,
Cherish the spirit.

Those who can do this
Will naturally be free of distinctions,
Free of love and aversion,
Free of fetters,
Free of grasping and rejecting,
Free of coming and going,
Free of defilement,
Free of afflictions.
The six desires will not arise,
The three poisons will vanish,
Forever escaping the wheel of rebirth,
Ascending to transcendence.

O assembly! Reflect: the original state is non-action,
Serene and empty.
Whence arise the obstructions of affliction?
All stem from the six desires and seven emotions.
Awakened, they become the ten virtuous deeds;
Deluded, they transform into the ten evil karmas.
Awareness brings wisdom, perfect and unobstructed,
Carefree and unbound.
Delusion brings affliction, inversion,
False thoughts, and ignorance,
Drowning in the river of craving,
Drifting through birth and death.
Within the six paths, tossed by waves,
In the three realms, suffering alone.

Alas!
Diligently cultivate the upright Dao,
Gradually enter the immortal lineage,
Refine nature and preserve spirit,
Enhance wisdom and still the heart.
Empty and quiescent within and without,
Illuminating the profound and luminous.
When merit and practice are accomplished,
The Five Elders will welcome you.
Undivided in spirit and form,
Merge with the Dao and ascend.
Thus forever escape the wheel of rebirth,
Ascend to transcendence.
Those who can do this—profound, indeed, is the mystery!

A verse says:
Turn the heart to dispel the self, escape the cage of dust,
Return to simplicity, awaken to the true lineage.
Mountains’ beauty arises from last night’s rain,
Flowers fall to the morning’s wind.
Where divine light shines, the profound is boundless,
When wisdom transforms, wondrous merit is achieved.
The Dharma-eye opens to the true realm—
A full moon hangs in the sky.

Thus I reveal to you this wondrous Dharma,
To ferry the people of the world,
To return to truth and know destiny.

Moreover, the Most High, pitying beings who commit myriad evil deeds,
Whose sins bind them to Fengdu,
Whose retributions cycle endlessly,
Whose enmities repeat,
Who wander lost in delusion,
Drifting through birth and death,
Has bestowed this wondrous Dharma,
Revealing it to the people of the world,
That they may know nature and destiny,
Return to truth and awaken to the Dao.

O assembly! What is *nature*?
What is *destiny*?
Receiving life from the Dao is called *destiny*,
Mastering the great Dao is called *nature*.
Thus human life is limited,
But the original nature is unborn.
As the Old Lord said:
“Where there is birth, there must be death;
Without death, there is no birth.”

Consider human life:
The great limit is thirty-six thousand days—
How many in the world reach seventy springs?
All arise from myriad evils,
Knowledge obscured in the sea of suffering’s ford,
Hastening ceaselessly in the wheel of rebirth,
Striving amid the four births and six paths,
Rushing into the depths of suffering.
For this reason,
Faces change repeatedly,
Yet the nature of true suchness,
From the beginningless past,
Has never known birth or death.
It is only because beings are deluded,
Losing their original truth,
Obscuring their original nature,
That they rise and fall with karmic force,
Live and die according to conditions.
Thus, how can they escape birth and death,
Awaken to true nature, and return to the Dao?

But look within at the heart,
Close the gates without,
Temper desire,
Purify the body.
Crookedness can be straightened,
Stillness can be practiced.
Love resides in qi,
Preserve it in spirit.
Unbroken throughout the day,
As if absent, as if present.
With the Dao’s work unbroken,
Ascend to the Jade Clarity—
Is this not fortune?

Recall the Most High’s myriad methods and thousand techniques,
All expounded and transformed,
Establishing scriptures and teachings,
Leaving behind precepts and rituals,
As the pearl that illumines darkness,
The key that unlocks Heaven’s gate,
The boat that ferries across the world,
The ladder that ascends to truth.
Pointing the way for all people,
All return to truth and see the Dao.

Consider the sages’ earnest efforts to transform,
Desiring to ferry all beings—
How can one bear to betray their virtue?

Ah!
Turn the light inward to reflect on the realm of true emptiness,
Laugh!
Ghosts wail and spirits cry without cease.

A verse says:
Alas for the rugged six paths—
How can they compare to turning the heart and awakening to the great void?
Shatter the illusion of “within” and “without,”
Then know the body contains “without” within.
The limpid moon hangs over the river,
The profound pearl gleams in the jade vessel.
If you seek to transcend worldly affairs,
You must apply true effort.

On the day of your destiny,
Hold a fast and set up an altar,
Invoke the Northern Dipper, the Three Officials, the Five Emperors,
The Nine Bureaus and Four Departments,
To offer blessings and dispel calamities,
Present memorials and supplicate with sincerity.
If, on the day of your destiny,
You solemnly purify the chamber,
Display banners, light incense and lamps,
Arrange the ritual in full,
Devote yourself to prayer,
Present memorials and petitions,
Invoke the deities of your destiny in the Northern Dipper,
Pray for blessings and grace,
Transform misfortune into fortune,
To aid the people of the world.

Thus the Most High, pitying beings adrift in the bitter sea,
Drowning in the ford of delusion,
Born and reborn in the three evil paths,
Dying and dying again in the six realms,
Has specially bestowed this scripture,
To guide them back to the right path.
If, on the day of your destiny—be it the first *jiazi* or other fast days—
You purify the heart and cleanse the self,
Swear allegiance to the Nine Heavens,
Reflect on past wrongs,
Vow to avoid future transgressions,
And invoke the original spirit of your destiny within,
Then you may dispel transgressions, scatter misfortune,
Banish adversity, and welcome good fortune.

How does one invoke the original spirit of one’s destiny?
Simply turn inward to the original heart, observe the fast, reform faults, and cultivate goodness—this is the way.
Fasting and offering rites: fasting is to discipline the heart, while offering is to express sincerity. By purifying body and mind, one may repent of past wrongs and thereby attain blessings.
Thus the saying: *"The sickness of the self must be cured by the self."*

What is the original spirit within the body?
Just as heaven has the Northern Dipper, so too does the human body; just as heaven has the Three Officials and Five Emperors, so too does the human form possess its counterparts—nine palaces and four bureaus, all mirrored within.
The Northern Dipper within the body is the heart. The Dipper governs the turning of the four seasons and the revolutions of the celestial bodies, just as the heart governs the transformations of the myriad things and commands the hundred spirits. Thus, the Northern Dipper is the heart.
The Three Officials are the three *hun*-souls; the Five Emperors are the spirits of the five viscera. The nine palaces are the nine orifices; the four bureaus are the four limbs.
If one can nurture the three *hun*, harmonize the five viscera, subdue the nine orifices, and protect the four limbs from worldly defilement, cutting off mundane attachments, awakening to the subtle and profound, attaining clarity and emptiness, and perceiving without obstruction—then one may soar beyond the material realm. At such a stage, to pray for blessings and grace is indeed wondrous.
Thus, the sages established these external practices to guide the inner illumination of non-action.
Ah! Do you grasp this subtle truth? Once revealed, the ten thousand phenomena of the azure heavens become still.

*A verse says:*
Turn the heart back, reflect, and sever worldly ties;
Awakening, one sees the natural state as it is.
The three realms are but fleeting flowers in the world’s dream,
While the cinnamon of the Nine Heavens veils the profound mystery.
The heart of Dao is like the moon upon the waves,
The nature of Dharma blooms like a lotus in fire.
When kalpas end and all is seen as void,
The green mountains stand tall against the distant sky.

With utmost reverence, present offerings—various incense and flowers, seasonal fresh fruits—following the rituals of the age. Purify the altar space, modeling heaven and earth.
Whether in a temple or at home, perform the rites according to your capacity. The merit accrued is profound and beyond full description.
Recite the names of the Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords, and your transgressions will dissolve, misfortunes be washed away, blessings and longevity sustain your destiny, and virtuous fruits manifest in your being.

Ice and charcoal cannot share the same furnace, nor can the wise and foolish dwell together. Ice and charcoal remain apart because their natures differ; the wise and foolish do not coexist because their perceptions diverge. Ice does not know it freezes, nor charcoal that it burns. The wise need not speak to be clear in wisdom; the foolish need not speak to be clouded in ignorance. The wise ever uphold righteousness and propriety, ever fearful of harming others; the foolish persist in cruelty, ever resentful of self-inflicted harm. Alas for the foolish!
Thus the *Book of Documents* states: *"The virtuous do good, ever finding the day too short; the wicked do evil, ever finding the day too short."*

Worldly beings, deluded and ignorant, fail to recognize their myriad transgressions. Yet the celestial officials record every good and evil deed without the slightest error. Know this: fulfill three thousand virtuous acts, and you may ascend as an immortal; accumulate eight hundred transgressions, and your life will be cut short. Then, in Fengdu, you shall endure bitterness alone, and your descendants will surely face hardship.
Alas! The Most High laments the emptiness of the Ten Continents and Three Isles, the ceaseless wandering of the six paths and four births. Thus, through this scripture, the law of cause and effect is expounded, and retribution is decreed—guiding the wise toward goodness and warning the foolish against evil.
By adapting teachings to the capacities of the deluded, the Most High established these precepts and prohibitions. For those with confused minds seeking repentance, let them purify the altar, solemnize the ritual space, arrange incense and flowers, present seasonal fruits, perform the rites, and contribute according to their means. The merit thus accrued is vast and beyond description.

Know that the Great Dao arises from emptiness, and the original nature exists within non-existence. Who can truly describe it?
Thus the *Scripture on Ascending to Heaven and Attaining the Dao* states:
*"Vast and obscure, the pure and tranquil Dao,
Dim and silent, the trace of the Great Void.
Its essence is serene, dwelling nowhere,
Form and mind both stilled in the One True Source."*

Thus, without the false, the true cannot be revealed; without illusion, how can reality be discerned? This wondrous Dharma is expounded to enlighten beings, that they may understand the causes of good and evil. Do not indulge in wrongdoing; do not yield to unchecked desires. Only then may one gradually enter the wondrous gate, awaken to the function of the Dao, and perceive the subtle mysteries beyond the material world—all within the square inch of the heart.

Ah!
Had you but recognized the original face,
You would have untied the knot of true emptiness long ago.

**Verse:**

Sever desire to cultivate the true,
Resolve to cultivate—then rise beyond the dust.
Renounce fame, profit, right and wrong, love and hate;
Let pine winds and bright moon be your neighbors near.

Shatter the illusory shadows of the dream,
Preserve the body beyond the body, ever pure.
I ask those who seek the Dao in this world:
Why let forms divide you into near and far?

In times of urgent peril, burn incense and recite the scriptures,
And peace shall come within the appointed time.

Thus speaks the *Efficacy of the Great Sage Northern Dipper in Resolving Calamities*:

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Three Disasters.

**Verse:**
The six senses—taste, touch, sound, and scent—
Spawn the Three Disasters, long-enduring woes.
Laughing at mirages rising on the sea’s edge,
Yet lost in wild geese’s script across the distant sky.
Not knowing things are false—what makes them so?
You must believe the fault lies in your own measure.
Like a rustic gazing at clouds in the wild,
Lingering speechless as the slanting sun stands still.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Four Slaying Calamities.

**Verse:**
The six dusts, uncast aside, breed harm;
The Four Slayings clash, stirring dread and woe.
Since demonic forces have not yet descended,
Ghosts and specters naturally contend and deceive.
Fierce winds snap the chrysanthemums in the courtyard,
Sudden rains batter the reeds by the river’s side.
Vainly resenting such carefree affairs—
At the end of one kalpa, at the start of the next, they appear and vanish.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Five Phases’ Calamities.

**Verse:**
Know the original lord of the primal beginning,
Whose spirit and form transcend the Five Phases.
How could the dark pines be locked by white clouds?
When have the marshes ever been barred by green waters?
All dharmas are but the ancient moon,
A thousand words but the one ancestral wind.
With forms and deeds, distinctions multiply—
Only by not obscuring emptiness is emptiness seen.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Six Harms.

**Verse:**
The Seven Primal Lords, sages of profound wisdom,
How dare the Six Harms raise their heads?
Wind sweeps the evening clouds—mountains stand unmoved;
Moon sinks in cold waves—waters rush on.
Through empty appearances, true appearances are known;
Through dust’s greed and sorrow, illusory cares are felt.
If only you cultivate vigilance day by day,
Your light shall naturally fill the Four Divine Continents.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Seven Injuries.

**Verse:**
The jeweled terrace and jade palace hold the Dao’s truth,
Yet the Seven Thieves hasten to deplete its cause.
Wind-tossed trees startle sweet dreams,
But the River of Stars allows leisurely wandering.
Refining the elixir needs no gold or jade;
Preserve your nature—do not be deluded by turbid or clear.
When all leaks in the heart are stilled,
A blue lotus naturally blooms in the fire.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Eight Difficulties.

**Verse:**
Stubborn natures chase the world’s clamor,
Illusion births Eight Difficulties, enduring torment.
Not knowing the body’s limits are set by fate,
You must believe the years flee, never to return.
Yielding to one thought, lost in love and desire,
You willingly embrace a hundred miseries in their bitter cage.
When sins are formed, what use is repentance?
Polish the precious mirror—no flaw remains.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Nine Stars’ Calamities.

**Verse:**
When fortune and misfortune intertwine, how can sorrow cease?
The Nine Stars refuse to lessen your transgressions.
All because a single spark of numinous light dims,
Permitting hordes of demons to vie for dominance.
Forsaking the old garden, you feel no longing,
Yet lost in illusory pleasures, you crave suffering.
If you do not break free from the bonds that bind you,
When will your divine nature know freedom?

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Calamities of Husband and Wife.

**Verse:**
Who knows that union conceals the Great Brahma?
When refining, you must restrain the demon hordes.
Yin and yang briefly return to the source’s path,
The divine nature must emerge from the river of love.
At night, the moon shines fair on emerald peaks;
At dawn, the sea winds harmonize by the azure stream.
Alas for the deluded ones who have not awakened—
So many neglect true emptiness, lost in the chase.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Calamities of Sons and Daughters.

**Verse:**
The numinous light, originally undivided,
Takes form according to causes—thus paths diverge.
Waters flood, clouds chill—waves freeze of themselves;
Sun rises, mist warms—ice melts away.
Fortunate to abide in constant purity,
Yet wisdom’s nature must not invite peril.
Losing the true and wondrous principle,
You waste your efforts in the cycle of Jambudvīpa.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Calamities of Childbirth.

**Verse:**
Knowing the cause, yet lost again in dust,
Passions open, leaks arise—the Dao does not harmonize.
Youth departs, age returns—decaying illusions,
Exiting one layer, reentering another—false forms.
The wheel of rebirth wears away adorned realms,
Defilement veils the jeweled mirror’s stand.
Now I urge the true superior ones of this world:
Cultivate well the state of no going, no coming.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Calamities of Repeated Afflictions.

**Verse:**
The divine nature is non-action, unbound by fetters,
How can repeated afflictions be your burden?
Worldly splendor does not know original sameness,
True principle is buried, its fullness unachieved.
The Eight Sufferings contend, creating obstacles,
The Ten Bonds converge, stirring fear and sorrow.
Knowing it is thus, how can you tarry?
Turn back, renounce—all is resolved at once.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Calamities of Epidemics.

**Verse:**
Heat and cold, wind and snow come and go,
Cutting short frail bodies, weaving calamities.
Not knowing how to nurture and harmonize,
Greed and delusion willingly harm the form.
The Six Thieves steal, depleting the radiant light,
The Five Ghosts hasten plagues and disasters.
Only by awakening to your true nature and invoking the Great Sage
Can you be rescued from peril, delivered from the wheel.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Calamities of Illness.

**Verse:**
If common folk wish to rise beyond the dust,
Do not let illness drive you to seek physicians.
If the mind’s ground cannot cast off clinging views,
What use is reciting true teachings?
Before the mirror, no trace was ever there;
Beneath the moon, clouds arise—yet its light remains.
Neither clinging to the middle nor the extremes,
Laughing, return to the cold stream by the cliffs.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Calamities of Demonic Influences.

**Verse:**
A stubborn heart refuses to extinguish all ties,
In the dusty realm, demonic forces contend before you.
True stillness and the Dao’s mystery grow daily fainter,
While infatuation with worldly pleasures turns to pity.
Gradually, the body’s splendor fades like a withering hall,
The elixir’s waters are stolen, the Jade Field depleted.

How much better to awaken to the affairs of mist and moon,
Preserving the true *qi* to strengthen one’s youthful years.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Calamities of Tigers and Wolves.

**Verse:**
The wondrous Dao of the Mysterious Origin is most subtle,
Yet when simplicity scatters into emptiness, who can know?
Through kalpas, it has never known birth or extinction,
Returning to the Yellow—is this awakening or delusion?
Fortunate is the autumn sky’s moon without clouds,
Yet the winding shore’s tranquility fears the taint of mud.
To subdue tigers and seize dragons is the very point—
Yet this must truly rest in the man himself.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Calamities of Insects and Snakes.

**Verse:**
Let not the primal awareness be replaced or renewed,
For when the nature is settled, all dusts naturally cease.
Monkey and horse find rest in the misty peaks’ slumber,
While insects and snakes, though startled by swift thunder, are freed.
In the spring-fragrant valley, orioles sing in the sun,
By the secluded creek’s bend, swallows sport in the clear sky.
Facing the scene, one bears it with one’s own strength—
The wind and moon of ten thousand mountains grow ever clearer.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Calamities of Bandits and Disasters.

**Verse:**
Who can foresee and restrain peril and danger?
Only by unveiling the profound beyond the clouds is it attained.
Before earth and before heaven, the true principle is known,
From the kalpa’s dawn to its dissolution, no fixed term is set.
Illuminating inner and outer, the round and harmonious work,
Awakening and illuminating the mechanisms of immortals and mortals.
With a single battle, demonic forces suddenly vanish,
The traces of plundering bandits fade into nothingness.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Calamities of Cangues and Cudgels.

**Verse:**
Bind the stubborn heart to prevent disorder,
And the three thousand penal laws lose their power.
Suddenly, the golden cangue of wondrous awakening falls away,
The great jade fetters of the mysterious wind are shattered.
At dawn’s shore, the cave’s brightness reveals hidden immortals,
By the cold pool, the moon’s radiance lingers in clarity.
Teach you to grasp the high principle of heaven—
Suffering and joy originally lie only in this.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Calamities of Unnatural Death.

**Verse:**
True awakening, round and harmonious, preserves the undifferentiated,
The mysterious flower above and below expands in clarity.
The jewel’s light, though eternal, why is it dim?
The jade grotto, though opened a thousand times, reveals the Dao’s brightness.
If the six senses indulge in delusion without awakening,
Passions open the leaks—death and rebirth recur.
To seek the path that transcends the wheel of rebirth,
Guard the spirit’s luminosity within, never taking it lightly.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Calamities of Curses and Oaths.

**Verse:**
Entangled in the floating life’s net, without refinement,
Suffering delusion in illusory transformations, indulging in greed.
The carefree original form is imprisoned by dust,
The unobstructed true spirit is nearly entombed.
When vexation drives one to vow and seek the Dao,
Once the affair fades, does the Dao-heart also cease?
Hurrying and bustling, turning the wheel of rebirth,
Ask yourself: when will you reach the end?

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Calamities of Heavenly Nets.

**Verse:**
The true principle of non-action leaves no trace,
Yet all is the heart’s delusion—paths remain blocked.
From ancient times, only due to craving worldly desires,
To this day, it entangles and obscures the mysterious void.
The oriole’s song—how can it understand the willow’s green?
The butterfly’s dance—how can it know the flower’s red?
Heaven’s killing and heaven’s giving—matters of grace and harm—
Better to seek the profound and break through the darkness.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Calamities of Earthly Nets.

**Verse:**
Know that worldly desires bring many harms to the body,
Better to leap with lofty resolve beyond the nets.
Greed and indulgence leave little level ground,
While ignorance and stinginess, unrestrained, turn to demons.
To escape the deep pit requires strenuous effort,
Before the trench is dug, do not falter for a moment.
Clouds and water, mist and waves, stretch boundlessly—
A small boat lightly drifts across the river of delusion.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Calamities of Blades and Warfare.

**Verse:**
How many kinds of blades and warfare exist in the world?
Amid the thickets of right and wrong, they recklessly contend.
Slanderous words are sharp as blades,
Yet a heart that embraces tolerance finds ease.
With a single thought, reform and pray to transcend the kalpa,
Calmly, even lamplight seems cold.
In the heavens, the Jade Pivot’s Lord presides—
Turning and sustaining, all is not difficult.

**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**
Can resolve the Calamities of Water and Fire.

**Verse:**
The sea of desire surges boundlessly, touching the sky,
The blazing fire of karma burns the plains.
Yet in emptiness, clarity, and stillness, waves are stilled,
In gentleness, forbearance, and serenity, smoke does not rise.
Forms and appearances both empty, the heart is naturally calm,
Unstained by right and wrong, one follows conditions.
Water ascends, fire descends—this is the true Dao,
A high bridge spans the ford, ferrying the great river.

Thus, the Seven Primal Lords, the Great Sages, are profoundly efficacious.
They deliver from all calamities and hardships,
Lifting suffering beings beyond distress.
If one urgently invokes them, reciting for protection,
All may rely on the generation of a hundred blessings,
Harmonizing with the Five Phases.
The three *hun* souls are secure and healthy,
Evil spirits cannot linger.
True *qi* descends from the five directions,
Myriad blessings naturally gather.
Longevity transcends the Eight Difficulties,
All through revering the Seven Stars.
Life after life, the body is at ease,
Existence after existence, the spirit remains pure.
Goodness is like a shadow in light,
Response is like an echo in a valley.
The Three Primal Spirits together guard,
The myriad sages share the same clarity.
Without disaster or obstruction,
Eternally preserving the tranquility of the Dao-heart.

**Verse:**
Subduing demonic forces, the heart is naturally tranquil,
The Seven Primal Lords, the Great Sages, are profoundly efficacious.
Ever let the nature be like the moon without clouds,
Never let the emotions be like duckweed on waves.
Externally, wash the troubled breast to remove stains,
Internally, polish the mysterious mirror to break through darkness.
Naturally, the Eight Difficulties and Three Disasters vanish,
All through revering the Seven Stars.

*Here ends the first scroll of the Commentary on the Wondrous True Scripture of the Northern Dipper’s Original Destiny for Extending Life.*

**Commentary on the Wondrous True Scripture of the Northern Dipper’s Original Destiny for Extending Life, Scroll the Second**

*Annotated and Versified by the Perfected One of Mystic Origin from Mount Kongtong*

The Lord Lao declares:
The Northern Apex suspends its image, and the host of stars pay homage—
It is the pivot of creation’s transformations, the sovereign of human spirits.
Behold! The Northern Apex hangs resplendent in the azure vault,
While the radiant stars circle the Celestial Throne in luminous array.
Thus, where the Dipper’s bowl turns, the ten thousand forms revolve in silent motion—
Who can fathom its hidden workings?

Yet those who seek the Dao in the world
Often exhaust themselves climbing mountains and fording streams in vain pursuit,
Wasting years without pause, seeking friends and masters—
Yet how can the primal spirit abide when they remain unaware?
They merely amass verses and recite poems,
But in the end, what do they truly gain?
All proves hollow in the end.
If one practices the Great Dao by grasping at fleeting clouds,
Or seeks the subtle and formless by clutching at shadows,
How can attainment ever be achieved?

How, then, does one observe Heaven and Earth to manifest the Great Dao before one’s eyes,
Or discern the stars to awaken to the Mystic Void beyond the world?

**○** The assembly asks: *What is meant by observing Heaven and Earth, manifesting the Great Dao, discerning the stars, and awakening to the Mystic Void?*

It is this:
Heaven and Earth each hold fast to purity and turbidity,
The sun and moon revolve in their courses,
Yin and yang ascend and descend,
The four seasons shift in transformation,
Giving life and death to the myriad beings—
The Dao accords with spontaneity, thus:
*This is observing Heaven and Earth to manifest the Great Dao.*

The Northern Dipper hangs high in the azure firmament,
Its revolutions follow the seasons,
Its cycles respond to all things,
It governs the host of stars,
Conceals and nurtures the ten thousand phenomena—
Such is the marvelous mystery of creation.
*This is discerning the Dipper’s stars to awaken to the Mystic Void.*

Thus, the sagely virtue pervades Heaven above and Earth below,
Giving rise to the myriad beings.
Were the Dipper not to turn, none of the ten thousand kinds could come to be.
Does this not inspire profound reflection?
If all beings could practice this method,
Their Dao-work would be infallible,
And the merit of their practice would surely be perfected.

It is told that the Mystic Martial Deity of the Northern Culmen, known as Perfected Warrior,
Once, in the Dragon-Han kalpa, pledged allegiance to the Northern Dipper as his teacher.
Later, on Mount Wudang, his Dao-work was accomplished,
And he ascended in broad daylight.
Yet since the age failed to awaken to this method,
After the Perfected Lord’s attainment,
None have followed in his footsteps.

Alas!
The true and profound principle lies elsewhere—
Not to be sought in the depths of cloud-wreathed mountains.

A hymn declares:
The wellspring of creation lies ever before your eyes,
The Dao hides not beyond the seas in recondite mystery.
When awakened, each thing serves its use;
When deluded, every turn becomes transgression.
Though winds rage and waters run deep, waves must rise,
Though rains cease and mountains stretch far, mists will linger.
The cassia moon hangs high in skies of azure clarity,
Everywhere the perfect round reveals itself in nature’s course.

Proclaiming might across the Three Realms,
Governing the ten thousand spirits,
Judging the appointed times of human good and evil,
Overseeing the eyes of right and wrong in the nether courts.

Now the Dao is the essence of one’s nature,
And nature is the mechanism of the Dao.
Whoever seeks to learn the Dao
Must first perceive their nature.
Thus, stillness of nature is the Way of Heaven,
While stirring of emotion is the response of things.

Yet the original nature of all beings,
Moved by love of things, stirs into emotion,
And through delusion and deviation loses its rectitude.
None can walk the Great Dao,
Nor guard against all evils,
Nor pass their days in tranquil detachment,
Nor follow circumstances with indifference,
Nor hold a will cold as dead ashes,
Nor maintain a nature still as rotten wood.
Instead, they are ensnared by worldly concerns—
Self and others, profit and fame,
Right and wrong, honor and disgrace—
By the six desires, the seven passions,
Greed, wrath, ignorance, and anger.
Heedless of the roots of sin,
They widely deploy their cunning,
Indulging in harm to others as if it were skill,
Deceiving their own hearts to seize what they deem gain.
How can they reflect that in the River of Love they sink into deep waves,
Or that within the cycle of death and life they suffer the wheel of rebirth?

O assembly! Strive to grasp the One without confusion in the heart,
Embrace the One without departing from the Dao.
How then may one guard the Dao?
The Great Dao appears formless to the eye,
Soundless to the ear.
It cannot be deemed existent,
Yet the four seasons follow its course,
And the myriad beings receive life from it—
Nor can it be deemed nonexistent.

Thus the *Sutra of Disaster Dispelling* states:
“Nonbeing is not nonbeing; being is not being.”
In truth, it is neither being nor nonbeing,
Utterly firm, utterly vast,
Finer than the tiniest mote,
Vaster than heaven and earth.
From yin and yang come cold and heat,
From sun and moon comes their revolution,
From the human comes spirit,
From the body comes movement—
Thus all transformations of heaven and earth proceed from the Great Dao.

But how to take up this single point?
Simply observe the essential mechanism of yin and yang,
Examine the adaptability of creation’s changes,
And naturally the body will accord with the principle of the Great Dao.

Confucius also said:
“Observe what they follow, examine what brings them peace.”
The meaning is the same.

If beings do not cling to deviant views,
Do not commit transgressions or wrongs,
But purify their minds and single-mindedly take refuge in the Northern Dipper,
Then none will fail to receive response.

The Northern Dipper governs the office of speech and tongue,
Directing the revolutions of the myriad transformations,
Administering the host of spirits.
Within the Dipper reside the deities who oversee judgment, peril, punishment, and transgression,
Charged with meting out trials and penalties;
And the deities who extend life, augment destiny, resolve calamities, and elevate rebirth,
Entrusted with recording meritorious deeds.
If but a single thought turns toward cultivation,
Life is prolonged and blessings inscribed,
And the gods silently protect them.
Thus one attains effortless freedom,
Roams carefree through the Three Realms,
Transforms in the Jade Clarity,
Soars through the Golden Gates,
In the great mystery of mysteries—
Is this not joy?

Ah!
Best to relinquish love and desire to awaken to the Dharma-gate,
To renounce greed and wrath and ascend the Great Dao.

The Hymn says:
Amid the world’s thickets of profit and fame,
They forget their original ancestral clan.
Vainly pursuing connections, their proclamations spread far,
Yet the wondrous workings turn sluggish and dull.
Limpid green waters obscure the lofty Han,
Vast white clouds veil distant peaks.
In the still of night, only the fisherman’s flute is heard,
Amid the smartweed’s glow, his trace is lost.

The Five Phases share a common endowment,
The Seven Governors follow the same principle.
They possess the power to reverse death and inscribe life,
The force to dispel calamity and transcend tribulation.
From emperors above to common folk below,
Though ranks differ, destiny knows no distinction.
Thus the myriad transformations of Heaven and Earth are but one transformation,
And the source of all things cannot arise save through the Dao.

Moreover, the constellations of Heaven and Earth,
The sun and moon, wind and clouds,
Thunder and lightning, rain and dew,
Rivers and seas, deep springs,
Hills and mountains, grasses and fragrant flowers,
Crops and harvests, the Five Phases and Seven Governors,
The shifts of yin and yang, the cycles of cold and heat,
The myriad forms of humankind,
All things and emotions—
All rely on the qi of emptiness and spontaneity, harmony and the Great One,
And thus are brought to completion.

O assembly!
Yet people of the world think not of inner truth,
But cling to external realms.
They forget the real and lose the Dao,
Indulging in greed and desire.
How can they expect a hundred years of light
When they waste their bodies in millennial decay?
Alas, the deluded!

They sigh for worldly folk,
Who adorn their chambers as dwellings for the body,
Unknowing that the body is the chamber for the spirit.
When the house collapses, the body has no shelter;
When the body leaks, the spirit has no abode.

It is also said:
Cease your infatuation with illusory realms,
Lest you squander your original truth.
Better to curb desire and still thoughts,
Refine your nature and clarify the mind.
Ever anxious that goodness falls short,
Ever fearful of faults that follow—
Contemplate the Dao, ponder the real,
And no evils arise.
Gather harmonious qi in the cinnabar field,
Establish immortal ranks in the Purple Palace.
Thus you gain the power to reverse death and exchange life,
The force to dispel calamity and transcend tribulation.
Break free from the wheel of suffering,
And roam carefree beyond the world.

Ah!
When the moon’s light in the cold sky knows no high or low,
And all obstructions are removed—
Everywhere is bright.

A Hymn says:
The Dao in essence is formless, beyond all words,
Cease seeking causes and conditions in the void.
Beneath the willow’s shade, one indulges in the orioles’ chatter,
By the smartweed’s shore, who knows the egret’s hidden depths?
How many reeds and rushes bloom where flowers fall by the bank,
While waves a thousand miles long dazzle the sky with their light.
At dusk, no fishing boats pass by,
Only the setting sun to face in old age.

Ordinary folk in the world,
Most are lost in delusion,
Unknowing that the body belongs to the Northern Dipper,
That life is governed by the Celestial Treasury.
When calamity and suffering strike,
They know not the gate of dissolution and release;
When praying for blessings and life,
They are ignorant of the path of refuge.

Consider how the Two Modes—Heaven and Earth—cover and bear all,
Silently operating through the mystery’s mechanism,
How the Three Powers—Heaven, Earth, and Humanity—merge and transform,
Opening wide the wondrous workings of the Dao.
Thus, when the Great Ultimate divided,
It transformed pure and turbid qi to form Heaven and Earth;
When the Great Dao gave rise to change,
It accumulated the essence of yin and yang to create the sun and moon.
The myriad forms stand in ordered array,
All beings and things receive their mandate,
Nurtured by the breath yet not ruled, yet ruling,
Sustained by the bellows yet acting without acting—
Such is the Dao’s natural completeness.

Moreover, in the human body, the four limbs and hundred bones
Move only by the heart’s command.
Thus we know that Heaven and Earth, endowed with the Dao, take form,
And so have life and death;
The human body, moved by the heart,
And so has fortune and misfortune—
All lies in what the wise discern,
For good and evil summon their own consequences.

The heart is spirit,
Spirit is nature.
When nature is settled, spirit is at peace;
When spirit is at peace, the heart moves.
Let the heart move with harmonious qi,
And the qi of the Orthodox Unity naturally aligns with the Dao—
Is this not joy?

O assembly!
Before the Great Dao formed the image of Heaven and Earth,
Above and below were empty and still,
Within and without vast and boundless.
Who could see and grasp it?
Who could speak of it?
Just as before human nature entered the physical body,
It roamed beyond the world,
Free and without constraint—
What affairs could entangle it?
What suffering could harm it?

Yet through kalpas upon kalpas,
From delusion to delusion,
It twists and turns in the wheel of rebirth,
Drifting through the cycles of life and death.
In death, it enters hell;
In life, it stumbles into the womb.
After birth and escape from infancy,
It gradually awakens to worldly matters,
Early drawn to perversity and wrong,
Losing its true principle.
Unmindful of its confusion,
It imprisons its originally unobstructed nature within the flesh,
Where ten thousand kinds of misfortune and vexation assail it,
Yet still it does not awaken.
Tell me, what glory or joy is there in the dusty world?

But the common masses,
Unknowing that their nature aligns with Heaven and Earth,
That their life shares the fate of the Dipper and stars,
Often see good yet do not follow it,
Rush headlong into wrongdoing,
Meet the cycles of waxing and waning,
Yet know not the way of nurturing life.
Though there are arts to prolong life,
How would they know the path of refuge?

Alas! Ah!
Fortunately, there is a path to ascend as an immortal,
Yet how can one avoid being swept away by the waves of greed and delusion?

The Ode says:
Rely on wisdom to rouse your heroic might,
Reverse the clear waves to surge from raging billows.
Ever let karmic roots give rise to good thoughts,
Lest the immortal’s path be overgrown with brambles and thorns.
The limpid lake’s clouds disperse—heaven’s edge lies far,
The verdant valley’s toad ascends—the sea’s corner soars high.
Alone before the cold river’s boundless scenes,
All are embraced by the cloud-clinging patchwork robe.

Thus the soul and spirit are struck,
Misfortunes coil and cling.
Some suffer grave illness unhealed,
Others fall prey to demonic harm,
Year upon year mired in distress,
Age after age beset by misfortune,
Entangled in lawsuits and summons,
Even the departed are drawn into suffering.

Now Heaven aids the good and punishes the unkind,
Thus it metes out retribution of fortune and calamity.
People fear misfortune and welcome fortune,
So they should cultivate kindness and goodness as their cause.
Thus Heaven urges goodness with the promise of fortune,
And people, desiring fortune, should guard against wrongdoing.
Yet the common masses, unaware of Heaven’s principle,
Merely crave fortune without practicing goodness,
Vainly fear misfortune without shunning wrongdoing.
For such as these, to hope for peaceful dwelling and fortune
Is something that has never been.

Those who dwell in peace and enjoy fortune
Are those who have once practiced kindness, established goodness,
Been cautious of transgressions, and guarded against wrongdoing.
Thus it is that fortune and misfortune arise from causes,
Good and evil reap their due retribution.
Those who deceive none and harm no other thrive long,
Only those who temper their nature and restrain themselves know lasting joy.
The clear record lies plain before your eyes,
Yet how can the obstinate heart not decide?

For example, in this world:
Diligence brings wealth,
Frugality brings abundance.
Without diligence and frugality,
How can one attain sufficiency?
Desiring fortune, one should accumulate goodness,
Fearing misfortune, one should guard against wrongdoing.
Without accumulating goodness and guarding against wrongdoing,
How can one dwell in peace?

Yet the common masses of sentient beings
Do not reflect on the retribution of good and evil,
Nor the clarity of rewards and judgments.
Instead, they harbor jealousy, stinginess, and greed,
Lose their true nature and forsake the Way,
Focusing only on the present,
Deceiving their conscience for momentary gain,
Never considering that myriad calamities will one day descend upon them.
Thus their souls are bound,
Misfortunes coil and cling,
Illness remains unhealed as malevolent qi invades,
Fortune does not flow as misfortunes arise,
In life, vexation;
In death, turmoil.
How much better to extinguish the karma of the mind and eliminate the karma of the body,
To awaken to the emptiness of form and perceive the emptiness of nature.

The Ode says:
Originally nothing bore a name,
But for greed and delusion, changes come unceasing.
Chasing pleasure, unaware it is the root of suffering,
Clinging to life, how can one believe it is the cause of transgression?
First, you must unlock the lock upon your heart,
Wash away the dust upon your nature from times past.
Best to tread with care upon the icy abyss—
Once lost, what day will you emerge from the depths?

Should Heaven’s reproach descend,
Or ghosts below lodge false accusations,
When such peril and distress arise,
How can one seek deliverance?
Hasten to petition the Northern Dipper,
Offer rites of thanks to the Perfected Lords,
And recite the true scriptures,
Acknowledge the Perfected Lord of your original destiny,
Only then will you attain peace and prosperity,
And even deeper mysteries—
Yet these cannot be fully described.

I humbly observe:
The Way of Heaven is impartial,
It befriends only the good.
Fortune and misfortune have their retribution,
What they respond to lies in the heart.
Thus those who do good find fortune drawing near,
Those who do evil find misfortune not far off.
The Nine Pure Great Canopy and the Three Wretched Hells
Both arise from the one heart, manifesting as two matters.
Thus know that the Way of Heaven does not fail sentient beings,
Rather, sentient beings violate the Way of Heaven.
Therefore, fortune and misfortune follow like shadow and form,
True retribution turns like a wheel in ceaseless revolution.

O assembly, do you not see how clearly rewards and punishments are meted out?
Why then remain utterly deluded and unaware?
Only deceiving your conscience for fleeting gain,
Ever seeking your own glory,
Harboring resentment and enmity,
Ever envying the joy of others.
How can you believe that to seek your own fortune,
You must first bring fortune to others?
Harming others to benefit yourself
Only harms yourself in the dark.
If you doubt this, ask yourself but one question:
Can deceit and luck outwit Heaven?

When sins overflow and transgressions mount,
Provoking Heaven’s wrath above
And the deceit of ghosts below,
In that moment of agony,
What use is regret?

Alas, when such peril and distress arise,
How can one seek deliverance?
Only by swiftly reflecting on your deeds and turning back,
Curbing greed and wrath to arouse a mind of expedient means,
Filling the pits and leveling the trenches to foster a mind of equanimity,
Performing purification rites to repent transgressions,
Concentrating your thoughts to invoke the Perfected,
Acknowledging the Perfected Lord of your original destiny—
Only then will you attain peace and prosperity.

How can one behold the Perfected Lord of one’s original destiny?
Hark!
Do not let the hordes of demons steal the mirror of your heart,
Ever let the mirror of your heart gather the hordes of demons.

The Ode says:
Let not this one be seized by the hordes of demons,
Battle the Three Corpses to break free from the net.
The waves of the bitter sea run deep—best to climb ashore,
The winds of the river of love blow fierce—best to ascend the slope.
If only you can grasp the nature of true emptiness,
Let the myriad realms arise as they may.
Willow green and peach red are but illusions—
Only fit to bow your head and laugh, hehe.

Whenever you behold the true form of the Northern Dipper,
Prostrate and revere it with utmost respect.

Now the Dao is originally formless,
Thus it nurtures all things and thereby takes form.
Though it has an image,
It embraces the Dao and is fundamentally formless.
Thus there is the false because there is the true,
Without the true, there is no false.
The Dao conceals itself within the myriad things,
Awakening comes only before your eyes.
People cling to what lies beyond one direction,
When deluded, where can they search for it?

For those who wish to learn the Dao,
How should they act to perceive it?
Only by following the good
And retreating from all that is evil.
Accumulate deeds and amass merit,
Align with the principle of Heaven,
Then you will encounter an enlightened teacher,
Who will guide you into the gate of non-action,
And you will behold the mysterious and profound Dao.

Thus goodness and evil arise from the heart,
The profound principle emerges from the teacher.
Wisdom must come from oneself,
The Dao is revealed through the teacher’s guidance.
Though you may meet an enlightened teacher,
If your own wisdom is shallow, you will not grasp the profound principle.
Yet even with keen wisdom,
Without a teacher, how can you fathom the subtle mysteries?

O assembly, if you wish to learn the Dao,
First follow goodness and retreat from evil,
Ever guard against wrongdoing.
From dawn to dusk, never depart from the Dao,
From moment to moment, never stray from wisdom.

Thus practicing in this way, the Dao is complete in all its aspects.

Yet common beings often lose the true Dao—why is this? Drawn outward by the ten thousand things, the five desires rage within, chasing pleasure and clinging to life, they stray from truth and lose the Dao. Therefore the Most High said: Do not cling to external appearances, lest the heart be disturbed. It is but the illusory scenes before your eyes that bring calamity in the life to come—how can one not be cautious?

Seeing the false, one awakens the true heart; encountering the true, one discards false intent. Consider those who, upon beholding the true form of the Northern Dipper, bow in reverence—why do they do so? The Northern Dipper is the pivot of Heaven, and its true form is the unchanging image from ancient times. Their bowing in reverence is the sincere devotion of the human heart.

The Dao is not to be sought afar—every thing is the Dao. Those who are deluded cannot awaken; every thing becomes delusion. Thus the sage transforms beings, recognizing the true within things, so that the great Dao is grasped in the palm of the hand. Therefore the teachings are expounded to prevent the foolish from harboring perverse views, from committing transgressions, to reveal the true through the false, and to deliver those who have not yet awakened.

The origin of good and evil lies in the heart. When acting, one should weigh carefully; where one should stop, one should reflect thrice before halting. Following this progression is truly wondrous—how could it not be fitting?

Ah! When the karma of the heart is eradicated, the three karmas are extinguished; where the demon of the mind arises, a hundred demons are born.

*Verse:*
The Dharma-form within the pot is originally still,
Yet it is ruined by the thief of following thoughts.
Appearing and vanishing in Jambudvīpa, coming and going,
Drifting and sinking in the sea of suffering, twisting and straightening.
How can it compare to frequently awakening to the scenes of the homeland?
Beyond kalpas, the clouds and mountains of the mysterious reach their utmost.
If you wish to know the true meaning therein,
Listen to the flute by the riverbank in the deep of night.

The First Star of the Northern Dipper: Yang Brightness, Greedy Wolf, Great Star Lord—those born in the *zi* hour belong to it.
The Second Star: Yin Essence, Great Gate, Primal Star Lord—those born in the *chou* or *hai* hours belong to it.
The Third Star: True Man, Wealth-Store, True Star Lord—those born in the *yin* or *xu* hours belong to it.
The Fourth Star: Mysterious Darkness, Literary Curve, Pivot Star Lord—those born in the *mao* or *you* hours belong to it.
The Fifth Star: Cinnabar Prime, Upright Integrity, Network Star Lord—those born in the *chen* or *shen* hours belong to it.
The Sixth Star: Northern Pole, Martial Brilliance, Discipline Star Lord—those born in the *si* or *wei* hours belong to it.
The Seventh Star: Heavenly Pass, Broken Army, Pass Star Lord—those born in the *wu* hour belong to it.
The Eighth Star: Cave Brightness, Outer Assistant Star Lord.
The Ninth Star: Hidden Light, Inner Counselor Star Lord.

*Verse:*
Who knows the nine orifices mirror the Celestial Stem?
The turning mechanism of the numinous terrace transforms all.
Forgetting intent when it arises brings blessings,
Lightness of heart in death becomes one’s own fault.
Silently bestow the cinnabar palace to connect with divine power,
Loftily spread the mysterious mountain to display sacred might.
Turning to the azure sky where clouds disperse,
The precious pearl shines brilliantly with radiant light.

Upper Terrace: Void Essence, Opening Virtue Star Lord.
Middle Terrace: Sixfold Purity, Minister of Space Star Lord.
Lower Terrace: Curved Life, Controller of Fortune Star Lord.

*Verse:*
To nurture life, one must first sever worldly dust;
Only by severing dust can one refine spirit and form.
When the clouds over the winding river grow still, the moon turns white;
When the mist in the secluded valley disperses, the mountains remain green.
The cinnabar lightning sleeps where the wind howls,
The jade pool plays where the dragon’s waters ripple.
When the sacred law of the Three Terraces is fittingly invoked,
The six demons flee in terror, finding no place to rest.

Such are the names and titles of the True Lords—ordinarily unheard of. Those who hear and uphold them possess profound Dao-heart and deep-rooted good affinity. To hear, recite, and maintain them brings merit and power beyond measure.

Moreover, the Dao of the Most Sagely is impartial, bestowing its blessings upon all beings. Wisdom varies in myriad ways, yet the original face remains without distinction. The causes of good and evil are like rain and dew, nourishing the four kinds of life and the six paths. Yet how difficult it is to ascend to the Nine Pure Heavens, how easy to sink into the Five Dark Realms—all due to the greed, attachment, ignorance, and delusion of beings.

In this fleeting life, clinging to worldly illusions, they disregard true emptiness. They take cunning and opportunism as skill, deceitful schemes as wisdom, wealth and profit as glory, and sensual pleasures as joy. Thus they lose the true Dao and are bound to eternal rebirth. Their tongues are like three-inch blades, constantly harming others; their minds are like ten-sided ambushes, ever scheming to outwit. Do they not realize that Heaven and Earth observe all, like shadows following form? The retribution of good and evil, fortune and misfortune, will surely come.

O assembly, do not lament the illusory nature of human life, with its seventy years of span. Half is consumed by night, leaving but ten thousand days. Within these, half is spent in worry and rest—how much time remains? How can one bear to commit transgressions?

Consider the human body: the large and small intestines are its rivers and seas, the two eyes its sun and moon, the five viscera its five sacred peaks. The head is round like Heaven, the feet square like Earth. Heaven and Earth are born through the Dao, and the human body grows by the Dao. Since the human body shares the same substance as Heaven and Earth, why do Heaven and Earth endure while the human body perishes? It is because Heaven and Earth embrace the Dao and remain tranquil. Embracing the Dao, yin and yang unite, naturally circulating above and below in ceaseless flow. The Dao harmonizes with the True One, thus they endure forever.

Yet the human body betrays the Dao and stirs. It depletes primordial yang, impairs the function of the Dao, and fails to preserve its true nature amid joy, anger, greed, and wrath. Deeply deluded by external realms, the yang soul wanes while the yin spirit waxes. Unaware of the principle of embracing the Dao, the four elements and hundred passages are ravaged by demons—how can it compare to the steadfastness of Heaven and Earth?

Therefore, those of superior wisdom who hear these teachings, awaken to understanding, uphold, recite, and take refuge in them, possess profound Dao-heart and deep-rooted good affinity. They encounter the true teachings of the Most High’s Mysterious Gate, escape the cycle of rebirth, ascend to the ranks of immortals, forever free from the tribulations of the six paths, and transcend to the bliss of the Ten Isles. They emerge into the profoundest mystery.

Alas! Having encountered the Mysterious Gate yet failing to awaken—how long will the cycles of rebirth persist?

**Verse:**
The Mysterious Gate finds few true kin,
Not hidden in clouds or sought in deep waves.
But turn back along the fragrant willow path,
And emerald mists and verdant peaks appear.
Walking, one sees mountain blossoms bloom;
Reclining, one hears wild birds sing before the hills.
This secluded dwelling is no distant road—
Awakened, it is truly never apart from the heart.

If faithful men and women encounter this true scripture, their wisdom-nature becomes complete, their Dao-heart unfolds. They emerge from the paths of delusion, enter the Gate of the Inaudible and Invisible, return to the true lineage, and attain the realm of flourishing life.

Now, whether one treads the gate of the utmost Dao or strays onto unvirtuous paths depends on the mind’s wisdom. When the mind reflects and corrects its errors, transgressions vanish of themselves; when wisdom awakens to truth, the Dao arises naturally. If wisdom fails to awaken to true emptiness and the mind clings to deluded paths, how can the true Dao of the Mysterious Gate ever be seen?

One must follow goodness and forsake wrongdoing, abide in stillness and depart from motion. Within stillness, sun and moon reveal another three mountains; within motion, the six paths of existence are never absent. Stillness is the origin of the immortal’s emergence; motion is the root of the mortal’s entry into dreams. Thus the wise transcend.

Moreover, every action may be right or wrong, every thought and念 may be deviant or upright. Right and wrong can be discerned; deviance and uprightness can be distinguished. Between right and wrong, deviance and uprightness, one should act with calm deliberation.

O assembly! Who can abandon crookedness and walk the broad Way? Who can drink deeply of virtue and power, becoming joyfully harmonious? The wise mingle with the world yet guard against wrongdoing; fools encounter true Dao yet lack right faith. If there are those of right faith and good wisdom who encounter this true scripture, their wisdom-nature becomes complete, their Dao-heart unfolds. They emerge from the paths of delusion, enter the Gate of the Inaudible and Invisible, return to the true lineage, and attain the realm of flourishing life.

**Wisdom-nature complete** means:
*Wisdom*: The eyes see the myriad things, the body dwells amid the dust, yet the nature does not arise in chaos, the mind does not cling—this is wisdom.
*Insight*: The functioning of the Two Modes, the true emptiness of the Three Mysteries—nothing hidden is not illuminated, no transformation is not penetrated—this is insight.
*Nature*: The spirit that abides through kalpas’ end and beginning, ever present and enduring.
*Complete*: Perfectly fused awareness, unimpeded and all-penetrating truth—this is the unfolding of the Dao-heart and sudden awakening to the true Dao. Naturally, one emerges from the paths of delusion, enters the Gate of the Inaudible and Invisible, returns to the lineage of the True One, and attains the realm of eternal life and flourishing joy.

When the dust-nature is not eliminated, the three disasters arise together; when the Dao-heart unfolds, the six desires all dissolve.

**Verse:**
The Dharma-mirror, radiant, veils the jeweled terrace;
Do not tarry, lest dust defile it.
Suddenly the wondrous Dao opens in true purity,
Shedding deluded paths and transforming sorrow into joy.
Realizing that conditioned existence has its uses,
One follows the teaching where there is neither going nor coming.
If the message of the Dao is truly awakened,
Its wondrous form and numinous power surpass the nine heavens.

On the Three Primes, the Eight Festivals, one’s natal day, and the days beneath the Northern Dipper, one should solemnly prepare the altar, recite the scriptures, and perform the fast and rites according to the proper forms. The blessings are boundless, spanning lifetimes without end, never straying from true nature or falling into deviant views.

Though iron ore is stubborn, through smelting it becomes a vessel; though the human heart is desirous, through embracing virtue and power and forsaking wrongdoing, it may be corrected. Ore unrefined never becomes a vessel; a person unrefined never becomes true. Thus, only through the master craftsman does one awaken, and only through virtue and power does one come to know emptiness.

The Dao is the origin of the myriad things; virtue is the source of the hundred practices. Thus the profound benefits of virtue and power pervade all—how few among the multitudes know their daily use!

Though the Dao is formless, it may be seen by forsaking desire; though virtue has its mirror, it is not perfected without accumulating goodness. Those who aspire to the Dao yet do not see its nature—how can they be true? Those who establish virtue yet do not cultivate its practice—how can they be benevolent?

All who cultivate Dao and virtue must embrace purity and truth, guard stillness, fill the belly and empty the heart, yield to others, and humble themselves with reverence. Without following these principles, those who study the Dao and cultivate truth will ultimately fail.

Before attaining the Dao, the mortal’s illusory body and nature arise from unequal good and evil, disparate fortune and misfortune—all governed by the celestial and terrestrial bureaus, officials who oversee life and death, punishing transgressions and rewarding goodness. Thus, on the Eight Festivals, the Three Primes, one’s natal day, and beneath the Northern Dipper, one should solemnly prepare the altar, recite the scriptures, perform the fast and rites, contemplate truth, invoke the Dao, repent transgressions, and pray for blessings. Thus sins will surely be erased, blessings will surely descend, one will not stray from true nature or fall into deviant views, and may preserve one’s heavenly years, attaining the Dao and enduring forever.

If one is submerged in deviant views, one strays from truth; straying from truth, one corrupts the Dao; corrupting the Dao, sins arise; sins arising, the form perishes.

Alas! Through the madness of the inch-long heart, one falls into the river of delusion; trusting the six thieves’ deceptive clamor, one is ensnared in the net of karma. How much better to refine a single grain of golden elixir, shedding the illusory transformations of the four births, attaining freedom beyond the world, merging with the Dao in truth, at ease in the profoundest mystery, without hindrance or obstruction.

**Verse:**
Within the body lies another numinous realm,
Its perfect fusion named the Profound and Obscure.
Sight and hearing know not its form,
Yet through the mysterious, it ever unites with the spirit.
The laurel moon hangs as a bright mirror,
The pine-clad mountain leans as an emerald screen.
High and low, the mountain moon is unobstructed—
All is forgotten, the two forms dissolved.

Those who uphold this scripture should constantly recite the honorific titles of the Seven True Lords of the Primes. When their merit is complete, auspicious blessings will descend.

**Explanation:**
There exists another majestic realm,
Unobstructed, unconditioned, naturally at ease.
Not a trace of worldly dust lingers in the heart—
Seated, one feels the protection and love of the myriad spirits.

**On the Mysteries of the Daoist Gate for All Disciples**

All within the Daoist gate should attend carefully to these matters. Those who cultivate the Real must focus on the root, for when the root is established, the Dao remains unharmed. Without knowing the root of the Dao, how can one reach the Jasper Pool? Thus the noble person attends to the root, and when the root is established, the Dao arises. To seek the mysteries of the Dao, first secure the root. With the root firm, seeking the Real is easy; seeking the Real while losing the root is difficult. Only when both root and Real are perfected does one arrive at the homeland of the Dao.

Moreover, non-action relies upon action. Thus, knowing the root exists in the manifest, one distinguishes it from the unmanifest. To recognize the root, one must first identify its essence. Once this essence is discerned and broken through, the ears and eyes become keen. The true and wondrous transformation has always resided within one’s own body.

Know that striking stone produces fire, and digging earth creates a deep abyss. To cultivate blessings, act with goodness; to sever karmic causes, cut off conditions. To quench thirst, one must have water; to resist cold, one must have silk. To advance in the Real and attain the Dao, guard against transgressions and avoid faults.

If one can diligently recite and uphold the teachings, meditate on the Dao, and contemplate the Real—without regressing in virtuous practice—then when merit is complete and deeds fulfilled, auspicious blessings will gather and descend. The spirit will be bathed in carefree ease, and one shall forever enjoy the Great Mystery.

Ah!
Though the fair scenes of the Three Isles are much praised,
The heart filled with wind and moon is yet more serene.

**Verse:**
Lofty towers and splendid halls well forth with numinous springs,
Within dwells the Cinnabar Sovereign, named the Natural.
The Primordial Chaos unfolds into lush abundance,
The Void Cauldron of Gold revolves with true mystery.
The yang spirit guards and stabilizes the land of Three Clarities,
The yin soul subdues and captures the Six Cavern Heavens.
Do not be deluded by illusory dreams at your pillow’s edge,
Lest the cold moon fill the fisherman’s boat in solitude.

Then follows the incantation of the Northern Dipper:

Northern Dipper of the Nine Luminaries, great deities of the central heavens,
Above you ascend to the Golden Palace, below you cover Kunlun.
You regulate the cosmic order, govern the cosmos.
Great Dipper, Greedy Wolf, Gigantic Gate, Store of Emolument,
Literary Brilliance, Integrity and Chastity, Martial Brilliance, Breaker of Armies.
Supreme Jade Emperor, Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord,
Encompassing the great celestial sphere, entering even the tiniest dust.
What disaster cannot be eradicated? What blessing cannot be attained?
The primal qi of the Original Sovereign comes to merge with my body.
Wherever the Celestial Stem points, it revolves day and night without cease.
The common folk, petty and unenlightened, seek the Dao and crave numinous power.
May they behold your august presence and forever preserve long life.
The Three Terraces of Void Essence, the Six Pure Ones of Curved Birth,
Give birth to me, nurture me, protect my body and form.
[...] Venerable Emperor, swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!

**Verse:**
The Mysterious Female’s pivot and mechanism array the transforming spirits,
Offering ascent to the Real and bathing in vast grace.
Auspicious mists block the path of hesitation,
The new moon opens the gate of joyous ease.
The upright qi gathers life, pacifying Yu and Ji,
The numinous source protects and nurtures, revolving Kunlun.
The Seven Primes, undimmed, radiate their luminous glow,
The myriad sages draw near to guard my honor.

Lord Laozi said: The nature, life, and five constituents of all people are entirely governed by the star officials of their original destiny. The spirit-generals of their original destiny and the star officials of their natal constellation constantly bestow their protective shade, sustaining life and preserving one’s allotted years. Yet the common folk, ignorant, pass their lives without awakening.

The true officials of one’s original destiny descend to the human realm six times each year. The day of descent is called the *limit-period of original destiny*. On that day, three thousand messengers of the Southern Mound and seven thousand spirit-generals of the Northern Dipper, along with the true officials of original destiny, descend in the company of all the perfected to surround and protect.

Moreover, the Dao nurtures the root of heaven and earth, and qi supplements the functions of the Five Phases. Things steal the numinous essence of heaven and earth to flourish, while humans steal the essence of the myriad things to seek stability. Thus the Three Powers and Five Phases, human relationships, destiny, and all things cannot be born without the Dao, nor can they stand without it. All things in the universe do not transcend the Great Dao.

Therefore, the Dao embraces the myriad phenomena. When humans awaken to the One Mind, the myriad phenomena propagate through the scriptures—yet they do not arise from outside the Dao. The One Mind transforms and operates, and nothing is more substantial than the Real. Those who wish to learn the Dao and return to the Real, to cultivate the body and preserve their nature, must attend to what is real and true.

Heaven can indeed be moved by the sun and moon, earth can indeed bear the numinous beings, and humans, among all the worlds, can naturally accomplish the true and perfect Dao, achieving the untainted.

Thus, with a true heart and sincere practice, the Dao is never empty in its realization of the Real. But if one’s heart is stubborn and unrepentant, how can sacred merit reach the gate of the Mystery? All practices must be grounded in true effort, for the great Dao of our Mystery Ultimate operates through the Real.

Alas! The floating world deludes people, who regard it as false. Alas! Shallow-rooted beings of meager practice—how could they believe the Daoist gate holds other profound and wondrous principles? They only delight in sensual pleasures, compete for fleeting wealth, and take pride in riches. They speak perversely and vie to hear contentious words. When they hear of true emptiness, they react with arrogance, slandering the Daoist gate as if it were mud and sand. They covet what is not theirs and forget their nature and life. The wondrous principles of the Mysterious Real are veiled by ten thousand layers of mist and water. In the bitter sea of delusion, when will they cross to the shore of the Dao?

Because the common people are ignorant and do not awaken to themselves, the Most High opens his golden mouth of non-action, spitting forth the mysterious pearl to aid all things. He points out the path to the Three Heavens and blocks the gateless Nine Nights. Benefiting all beings, his grace moistens all ranks. He guides the most excellent to become celestial perfected, leads the middling and lesser to return to the correct Dao, teaches the Three Vehicles, and transmits the scriptures of ten thousand transformations.

This is because the seed-nature of beings differs, and their faculties vary. To convert those of superior roots, the superior vehicle is taught. But there are those of middling and lesser capacity who cannot grasp this principle. For them, binding the heart and refining the nature, silently and wordlessly applying the Dao, advancing the formless principle, and yearning for the imageless Real—none but those of superior roots can comprehend this.

Thus the middle and lesser vehicles use external conditions to reveal the inner Real, expounding the manifest to distinguish the untainted.

As for the true officials of original destiny descending six times each year to the human realm, this refers to the days corresponding to the sixty-year cycle of one’s birth year—these are the *original destiny days*. Each year, there are six occasions when one’s original destiny aligns, which are the *descent days of original destiny*. On these days, the star officials of one’s natal constellation and the spirit-generals of one’s original destiny descend to the world to observe good and evil. Accompanied by three thousand messengers of the Southern Mound and seven thousand spirit-generals of the Northern Dipper, they all come to surround and protect.

On these days, one should practice abstinence, recite scriptures, repent, and pray for expiation. Revering the host of perfected and honoring one’s original destiny will dissolve calamities and misfortunes, extending one’s years and destiny.

The three thousand messengers of the Southern Mound are likened to the image of *li* fire, the three yang of the Cinnabar Yang Palace forming the three hun-souls. When activated, the numinous spirit is born and presides over the heart. The heart can restrain the form and spirit, preventing disorder.

The seven thousand spirit-generals of the Northern Dipper take the form of *kan* water, the abode of black yin. The seven essences open the seven orifices; when unobstructed, radiance pervades and governs the kidneys. The kidneys can securely guard the essence and qi, preventing their dissipation.

These are the loci of the original true within the human body. When the true origin resides in the valley, the Three Corpses, Seven Po, Six Desires, and Nine Worms all follow the Dao, and the myriad spirits and host of perfected come to surround and protect. This is the reality of the Dao.

Ah! If one comprehends the subtle message of the Great Mystery, Mount Tai transforms into the Jade Capital Mountain.

A hymn says:
The shore of the River of Love is vast, waves delude the heavens,
Best to withdraw and board the Dharma boat.
Restrain the playful monkey to sleep on the herb-strewn path,
Let the willful horse roam the fragrant fields.
Penetrating the profound principle, the Dao is everywhere,
Awakening to the subtle mechanism, Chan is in all places.
On a moonlit night, chanting alone, hoist the oar,
The homeland shimmers before the ancient peaks.

This can dissolve calamities, repent sins, invoke blessings, and extend life. According to one’s capacity, perform rites and offerings, and merit and virtue will increase.

If the term of one’s original destiny is approaching and one remains unaware, failing to establish abstinence rites or tend incense and fire, this is to trifle with life and be deluded about one’s origin, not cherishing the human form. The celestial offices will revoke one’s emoluments, diminish one’s allotted years, and often lead to premature death.

Those who err in this way, even if they encounter scriptural instructions, harbor disbelief and slander the true texts. After such persons pass away, they sink into the Three Wretched Realms, drift through the various destinies, and forever lose the human form. Deeply pitiable, they bring this suffering upon themselves.

Just as one seeks smoke near wood or quenches thirst near a spring, one shuns wrongdoing to draw near goodness and flees folly to approach wisdom. Wood’s nature is not fiery, yet drilling it produces flame; the human heart pursues desires, yet restraint gives rise to the Dao. Without the worthy, do not debate folly; without a spring, do not slake thirst; without the upright, do not recognize the perverse; without the true, do not know the false. By the false, the true is revealed; by the perverse, the upright is known.

For instance, the Jade Terrace suspends a precious mirror, its radiance resplendent within. How can you, possessing a bodily form, hold the profound mystery of the Great Dao yet remain devoid of it? The precious mirror is the original true; what appears within it is the illusory bodily form. The true is concealed within the false. One should polish the heart-mirror to remove even the finest speck of dust. When one’s nature harmonizes with the Dao, it pervades the ten thousand realms. The Great Dao encompasses all things; when one’s nature is contained, the mind is never disordered. Once one knows the ten thousand things to be false, the solitary mind alone illumines the true. If one grasps and uses things, there is no way to delight in the Dao; if one departs from things in speech, there is no path to ascend to heaven. This is like gazing toward the sea’s edge and suddenly beholding the osmanthus moon, or strolling a mountain path and instantly sensing the pine wind. Through aversion, one may follow goodness; through the false, one may know the true. Through the ordinary, one knows the sage; through the sprout, one knows the root.

Moreover, the common people in the world, the multitude of beings, do not use false things to point to the true—how then can they discern forms? Without using dharmic appearances to transmit emptiness, how can they recognize the formless? Thus, the sages bestow transformation for the sake of the unenlightened.

Therefore, the Most High said: “Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.”

If all of us, the multitude of beings, awaken to this Great Dao, know the term of our original destiny, and advance along the immortal’s steps by upholding this profound scripture with unwavering dedication, our merit and virtue will naturally increase.

If one does not progress in the mysterious work but is instead one who trifles with life and abandons destiny, one’s inherent nature will enter another bodily form, the heart will gather myriad sorrows like ashes, and when will the river of karma become clear? One will be bound and imprisoned in the iron domain—how can one ever rest?

Better to rely on a single wisdom to ascend the heavenly path; do not follow the Three Corpses to become a prisoner of the earth.

A hymn says:
Practice the true according to your capacity, and you will see the true;
Arduous cultivation requires diligence from the outset.
One must undertake genuine and steadfast practice
To enter the gate of non-action and attain freedom.
The sea of karma has no thousand-mile shore,
The Penglai Mountains are obscured by ten thousand layers of clouds.
Where the fisherman’s lamp shines, the cold river is still,
Gulls and egrets take startled flight, losing their former flock.

If on the days of one’s original destiny one performs abstinence rites and communicates with the celestial offices, within the term of one’s original destiny one may open and transmit the true scripture, widely present offerings, and thereby ensure that for three lifetimes one will always be reborn as a man, wealthy, noble, intelligent, and preeminent among people.

It is said that emotions arise from things, perceptions from the mind. When desire and emotion arise, the Three Mountains become Fengdu; when desire and emotion cease, the Nine Nights become the Mysterious Mansion. Generally, why do the host of demons and myriad sufferings come? Why do the Eight Difficulties and Ten Entanglements arise? Desires are the root of the host of demons and myriad sufferings; disordered nature is the chief of the Eight Difficulties and Ten Entanglements. Desire has no root—it is the eye that leads desire; demons have no hindrance—it is the heart that gives rise to demons. Thus, the five tones deafen the ears, and the five colors blind the eyes.

The *Yin Fu Jing* states: “The blind excel in hearing, the deaf excel in seeing. Cut off the source of profit, and your forces are tenfold; reverse this three times day and night, and your forces are ten thousandfold.”

All the myriad conditions and thousand practices arise from the single heart.

It is also said: The green willows and red peaches are illusory transformations before one’s eyes; the clear wind and white moon are the livelihood beyond the kalpa. If one silently illuminates the Great Tenuity, the spirit is born in the Cinnabar Palace; if one is deluded by worldly desires, the po-soul falls into the Cold Pool. The myriad dusts and leaks, the ten thousand kinds and ends—one need only recognize the original within the false and seek the substantial appearance within the formless. Then one may practice the Great Dao.

Oh, the assembly! The present circumstances are vast and multifarious, the delusions of worldly states are endless. The seven emotions and six desires, the five ghosts and three corpses, transform into demons to deceive you into the river of delusion, using worldly pleasures to lure you into the sea of karma. All manner of calamities descend—how can one bear them? One must only subdue the heart, and the host of demons will submit; restrain desire, and the myriad sufferings will dissolve. When the heart is extinguished, the ten thousand dharmas are extinguished; when emotions arise, the myriad sufferings arise. Entering the mysterious gate of the Dao, the night palace of the hidden pass, the path is fundamentally one, yet one may walk two ways. The numinous spirit shines, opening the light of the Nine Nights; the po-soul scatters, darkening the Three Mountains. The joys of heaven, the imprisonment of hell, the fruits of wrongdoing, the causes of good acts—all transform according to the spirit-terrace and manifest from wisdom and nature.

If there are sentient beings who understand the principle of their original destiny, purify themselves through fasting and precepts, and extinguish the leaks of worldly dust, their meritorious deeds will ascend to the heavenly courts, granting them dignified and majestic countenances, attaining the rank of Perfected Ones, and crossing beyond the sea of suffering—all because they subdued the heart and overcame demons, embraced goodness and renounced evil, thus ascending to the carefree immortal realms, avoiding the shackles of dark prisons.

For those who uphold the scriptures and cultivate the Dao, following the texts of the Most High and transgressing none of the sacred prohibitions, attaining the Dao and becoming immortals, they receive the grace of the ancient sages. How shall they repay this? As the *Song of Realizing the Dao* says: "To grind one’s bones to powder is still insufficient repayment; a single thought of clarity transcends kalpas beyond count."

One must only yearn for the Dao with clarity, purifying the heart until it is free of defilement—this is to not betray the principle of heaven and earth.

Hark!
Chisel open the stone wall, and no barrier remains;
The ten thousand images and all phenomena appear within the palm.

A eulogy says:
The mysterious and numinous, in great compassion, delivers from the cage;
Broadly transforming the Three Vehicles to awaken to the Great Void.
Before your eyes, you know what to take and use—
Do not seek traces in the clouds where others speak.

The peach-laden Han and willow-lined shores are your family’s affairs;
The osmanthus moon and pine winds are the legacy of my ancestors.
How laughable are those many Dao-seekers
Who chase after worldly scenes, running east and west.

For those whose karmic endowment is meager, though born among humans, poor and lowly, even if they understand their original destiny but lack the means to cultivate, if they can pour water or offer flowers, silently turn their minds toward the Northern Culmen, bow in reverence, and invoke the name of their Original Destiny True Lord, they shall not pass their destined lifespan in vain. All will gain extended life and recorded blessings, securing human rebirth in every generation, dispelling calamities, and obtaining boundless fortune.

The Heavenly Master rejoiced, leapt with joy, and bowed in reverence, praising the rare encounter with this supreme Dharma-bridge.

Now, the nature of water is perfectly level, yet waves arise with the wind; the human heart is originally still, but movement arises from external things. When things do not cling, emotions do not arise; when the heart remains empty, desires naturally fade. Love and desire arise from the heart, while form and spirit are lost to external things. Adrift in the boundless sea of karma without returning to shore, one drifts at will; dimly traversing the paths of Fengdu, one follows perilous routes—only when the time is lost does one awaken, like propping up a shadow at noon to guard against sorrow.

O assembly! Greed, infatuation, delusion, stinginess, and miserliness—how pitiful that foolish people do not awaken! These are the causes of losing one’s nature and life, the roots of straying from the true mystery. Worldly pleasures and blind attachment bring no benefit; the opening of the Dao-heart is our true glory. Clouds and mist in secluded caves idle away the light of sun and moon; ornate pavilions and splendid halls reveal the changes of stars and frost. Beyond the world, apart from dust, there is another realm of carefree wandering—how can the fleeting vanities and worldly pleasures of the mundane realm be free from harm?

Those who cultivate truth and refine their nature must, within the twelve hours and one hundred moments of each day, in all actions whether moving or still, keep body and mind pure, always establishing expedient means. Naturally, merits and deeds will accumulate, goodness will reach the Three Heavens, and one will ascend to Perfection and attain the Dao.

Thus, the Most High has said: "Advancing goodness is like stealing." Therefore, in the dusty world, one harmonizes with light and follows the times, establishing goodness according to conditions. If one speaks of goodness but does not practice it, the gate to realizing the Dao remains closed; if one sees wrongdoing and can renounce it, the path to ascending as a Perfected One lies open.

Those who wish to cultivate truth and learn immortality must establish truthful conduct. Though in the world, poverty and nobility, high and low, each have their distinctions, the Great Dao and true emptiness are truly without differentiation. Some advance the Dao through solemn wisdom and a pure heart; some set up banners and arrange images to pray for blessings. Though the methods differ, all lead to the same path. While worldly conditions vary between wealth and poverty, the heart of heaven makes no distinction between high and low. If one can arouse a single thought of advancing the Dao and doing good, externally, the celestial and terrestrial spirits will protect them; internally, their original destiny, form, and spirit will delight. Naturally, calamities will be dispelled, and boundless fortune obtained.

At this time, the Heavenly Master received this scripture, overflowing with joy.

The Heavenly Master is one who upholds the Dao and assists rectitude—thus called the Teacher of Heaven. Those who stray from the true and pursue the perverse are called ghosts of the earth. Therefore, those who awaken to the Great Dao of truth may truly be said to have encountered the supreme Dharma-bridge.

Hark!
One spirit upholds rectitude, free of deceit;
The Three Realms’ carefree wandering all lie within.

A Hymn says:
The willow-lined shore distinctly spans the Dharma-bridge,
Yet deluded, one finds the path as distant as can be.
Mist drifts o’er riverbanks where mountain hues grow faint,
Sunlight bathes the secluded hamlet, wild hues fade away.
Fortunate indeed—originally free from clinging forms,
Yet forced today to speak of ceaseless woe.
Who knows how many in the human realm turn back their gaze?
Moonlit and wind-clear, I alone beckon.

Commentary and Hymns by Xuanyuan Zhenren of Kongtong Mountain

The Most High Lord Lao further addressed the Heavenly Master, saying: The sins and blessings, good and evil of worldly people all fall under the governance of celestial offices. To repent of sins and dispel calamities, nothing surpasses cultivation and reverence. On one’s original destiny’s birthday, at the life-mandate’s mid-cycle, at the Horse of the Year, or during the Three Disasters and Nine Calamities, one may safeguard the present and ensure the well-being of one’s kin.

Originally, Heaven and Earth bore no form, and the Dao lay hidden in primordial chaos. Before the sun and moon took shape, qi resided within the Great Simplicity. When one qi sufficed, the Yellow Center governed; when the Great Simplicity dispersed, the myriad things began to arise. The Three Powers spread transformation among the host of spirits; the Six Movements breathed through the bellows. Cold and heat shifted in alternation; the pitch-pipes harmonized in resonance. Above, the radiance of sun and moon scattered, arraying the stars; below, the clear and turbid sediments congealed, forming hills and mountains. All things were born and nurtured; all beings flourished and multiplied. Yet when humans plunder the myriad things to attain peace, things deplete humans to attain the Dao. Spring’s luxuriance yields to autumn’s decline; there is birth, and thus there is death. If one remains formless and imageless, there is no death, nor any end.

The multitude’s eyelashes are not distant from their eyes, yet they fail to see clearly. The Great Dao lies solely within the heart—how could one cultivate it without recognition? Cloud-palace and Brahma-towers, jewel gardens and soaring forests—through form one discerns the formless; by relying on conditioned causes, one knows the unconditioned. Through action one attains non-action; through form one achieves formlessness. The numinous terrace, undimmed, reflects the Dao’s clarity; dust accumulates, obscuring the spirit’s radiance. When the numinous wanes and essence scatters, the body sickens and perishes. The three hun drift into the vast, empty paths of the yin realm—oh, how boundless! The hundred joints and bodily frame lie scattered upon the desolate mounds—how desolate! Though one may rival the wealth of a kingdom, what glory remains today? Though one may bear the empty title of six seals, what benefit does it bring in the end?

The world’s deluded cling to desire, losing their original destiny; they indulge in greed, exhausting their Horses of the Year. Their eyes follow peach-red and willow-green, unaware of the source of emptiness and form; their minds chase butterflies and blossoms, unable to distinguish the divisions of causes and conditions. In the vast expanse of the sea, within the swirling vortex, how long will they drift? In the deep recesses of mountains, within the cloud-caves of stone, when will their frantic scurrying cease?

Yet worldly people abhor dampness and dwell below; they fear death and cling to life. They do not know that life is the root of death, and transgression the head of misfortune. One ought to fear dampness and dwell on high; cling to life yet transcend death; dread misfortune and guard against transgression; prevent calamity and refrain from wrongdoing. Naturally, one becomes a carefree immortal of the earthly realm.

Moreover, when sentient beings commit wrongs and violate prohibitions, their transgressions accumulate—what method can absolve them? What means can avert them? It lies in repenting past wrongs, forever severing future errors, and wholeheartedly contemplating the Great Mystery. Reverently and diligently honoring the mid-cycle of one’s own life-mandate and the Horse of the Year, one may shed the Three Disasters and Nine Calamities, safeguarding the present and ensuring the well-being of one’s kin.

What is the life-mandate’s mid-cycle, the Horse of the Year?
The *yuan* is the beginning; the *chen* is the true image; the *yi* is the dwelling-valley; the *ma* is the stubborn beast. To invoke blessings, one must pray and supplicate, seeking the original beginning, aligning with the Great Dao, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, moving with the sun and moon, equaling the mountains, penetrating the profound and attaining the mysterious—non-action without hindrance. This *yuanchen* repents of transgressions and turns toward virtue, thereby dispelling calamities and transcending misfortune.

If one can bind the mind-monkey within the dwelling-valley of the self, restraining the will-horse, naturally the myriad disasters will not encroach, and the host of demons will bow in submission. Then one attains carefree wandering through the Three Realms, realizing the Mystery of Mysteries.

Hark!
Only when the self’s Horse of the Year is captured and subdued
May the original destiny shed the Nine Calamities.

A Hymn says:
Strike not the original spirit upon the Five Aggregates’ mountain,
For within it, illusory affairs abound in difficulty.
Deluded clouds often cling to the numinous terrace’s companion;
Love’s waves surge repeatedly within the cinnabar palace.
The Nine Calamities gradually arise as the monkey and horse flourish;
The Three Disasters turn and stir as ghosts and demons grow stubborn.
Who knows the true message revealed in illumination?
Wind and moon, serene and untouched, remain undisturbed.

Whenever superior practitioners uphold this true scripture on their original destiny’s birthday, they externally subdue demonic spirits and internally pacify their true nature. Their merit extends to the water and land realms; their goodness reaches both the living and the deceased. Through repentance and reverence, they gradually ascend to wondrous fruition, reestablish mysterious merit, and realize the Dao of Emptiness. Thus they attain sagely wisdom and perfect penetration, becoming unfathomable in concealment or manifestation, moving freely between being and non-being, wandering carefree among the clouds, ascending through the Golden Gate to unite with the sages. Their bodies transcend the Three Realms, forever freed from the wheel of rebirth, their lifespan boundless, their joy and ease self-attained.

Moreover, the distinctions between good and evil all arise from one’s actions; the two paths of fortune and misfortune truly stem from one’s conduct. Generally, when illusory demons run rampant, transgressions inevitably accumulate; when the karma of the heart is extinguished, sins also perish. Though one knows that good and evil, fortune and misfortune follow like shadows after form, they cannot be escaped.

Yet the common worldly multitudes do not know what is most intimate or what is greatest. Though they know only the Dao is greatest and only destiny most intimate—now that they recognize the Dao’s greatness and destiny’s intimacy, how should they seek it? How should they protect it? One must know that the hub arises from the wheel, and the net from its cords. With a single mind embracing rectitude, the myriad dharmas remain free from deviation. If one cannot respect what is intimate, how can one respect what is distant? If one cannot delight in what is internal, how can one delight in what is external? Thus, respecting the intimate naturally extends to the distant; delighting in the internal naturally radiates outward. Therefore, one may rectify the self, and all things will naturally follow without command.

What is intimate cannot be disrespected; what is external cannot be delighted in without first delighting within. Thus, reverence for the intimate ensures goodness toward the distant; inner joy naturally extends outward. Therefore, one may rectify the self, and all things will naturally follow without coercion.

○ O assembly! Like dragons roaring and tigers howling, ascending and descending within the cinnabar crucible; like ghosts wailing and spirits shrieking, fleeing in terror beyond the Yellow Court—thus may one attain the Dao of emptiness and formlessness, with boundless longevity, joyous freedom, and carefree wandering through the Three Realms. Ascend through the Golden Gate to unite with the sages and merge with the True.

Hark! The body arrives at the misty moonlit banks of Qu Brook, where the hues of Mount Chu’s peaks grow ever clearer.

*Verse:*
By the Jade Void Terrace, primal unity once reigned,
Unobstructed, uncontrived—eternally the same.
Yet deluded by passions within birth and death,
Bound to true awakening’s comings and goings.
All cling to being, only to grasp at being,
Though leaning on emptiness, they still fall into void.
When emptiness and being are mirrored in the square inch of the heart,
Naturally, the divine powers unfold in endless display.

Whenever men or women, on their life-destiny birthdays or during various fast days, purify body and mind, burn incense, and hold this true scripture, recognizing the Star Lord of their life-destiny at the Northern Culmen and praying with sincerity, no good shall go unanswered. Disasters and transgressions will dissolve, and ten thousand sages and thousand perfected ones will all come to guard and protect. Wherever this scripture resides, a thousand perfected pay reverence, ten thousand sages offer protection. Demons and ghosts vanish in silence, spirits and sprites hide in submission. All worldly calamities and misfortunes shall be utterly dispelled.

Moreover, the Great Dao is hard to name; its mysterious workings are unfathomable. Its vast grace spreads over the ten thousand things; its wondrous transformations pervade the eight directions. All ranks partake in its bounty; no being is left unsupported. Yet the Dao bears all without exception, bestowing the grace of utility; things thus come to life and flourish, unfolding the transformation of non-doing.

It is also said:
The emptiness of utility is not utility;
Non-doing as form—how could it be non-doing?
To grasp the principle within use and non-use
Is to escape the wheel of rebirth and end sighs of sorrow.
Know then that heaven and earth cover and bear with boundless grace;
Sun and moon illumine with equal grace.
The Dao’s transformed bodies—who would not cherish them?
Yet men know not that the body is the state,
That life is the sovereign,
That the spirit is the root,
That qi is the minister.
Lost in delusion, they are bewildered by the five colors;
Following craving, they are ensnared by the six dusts.

One must know:
When the sovereign loves and respects the state, it prospers;
When spirit and qi harmonize and surge, the body does not perish.
When ministers are loyal to the sovereign and the sovereign loves the ministers,
The household and nation from this turn to flourishing.
Though barbarians may be fierce and bold,
None dare wage war.
In general, harmony brings peace;
Rectitude subdues evil.
With a single thought stilled, the ten thousand conditions are forgotten.
If a single thought of causation arises,
One incurs the retribution of the Three Wretched Realms—
Past, future, and present;
Abandoning the body, repaying the body, receiving the body.
Deluded, one knows not the crossing of the abyss;
Greedy, one knows not the climbing of the steep ridge.
Stolid as if dumb, dazed as if dreaming,
Kindling the fire of ignorance,
Burning and destroying the splendor of the jeweled tower.
Leaking through the ford of delusion,
Scattering and dissipating the principle of true origin.
Thus are the multitudes of beings vast indeed.

Whenever men or women, on their life-destiny birthdays or during various fast days, purify body and mind, burn true incense, hold and recite this true scripture, recognizing the Star Lord of their life-destiny at the Northern Culmen and praying with sincerity, no good shall go unanswered. Disasters and transgressions will dissolve; ghosts and demons will hide in submission. May all sentient beings together escape the fruits of karmic action!

Hark! The Seven Perfected seek in vain for a place to relieve suffering—
When a single thought is forgotten, another heaven appears.

Hymn says:
Ten thousand layered cloud-mountains rise in emerald splendor,
The homeward path is clear—how could it ever err?
Yet who knows this foreign land is fair?
None heed that in the end it is not their true home.

To relinquish attachment is true repentance,
To forget greed is the great cinnabar elixir.
Subduing the heart, one enters the subtle path—
Smiling to see the creek-wind bear fallen blossoms.

This is called *The Northern Culmen Life-Prolonging Scripture’s Key*,
The very path of cultivating truth.
All who attain the Dao and roam freely do so through this scripture,
All who verify sageliness and achieve perfection do so through this scripture,
All who escape birth and death do so through this scripture,
All who protect men and women do so through this scripture.
To preserve life and extend years is to gain mastery—
Forever a treasure for the body,
Where fortune and longevity may be proclaimed.
Guard and revere it;
Show it not to the unworthy.

All who cultivate the Dao rely upon the principle of preserving truth and refining nature.
Thus, those who obscure their nature bring upon themselves manifold misfortunes,
While those who awaken to truth know boundless blessings.
Good and evil actions arise solely from the heart;
Fortune and misfortune are discerned solely through wisdom.
For the common person in the world,
Every thought, every deed, every movement and repose,
Fortune and misfortune, good and evil,
Intermingle and intertwine.
Discernment lies in wisdom:
When encountering good, advance and follow it;
When meeting evil, retreat and guard against it.
To retreat from evil is to establish merit;
To guard against wrongdoing is to preserve virtue.
Thus may one enter the Mystery Gate.

Empty words of forsaking evil, without establishing true merit,
Idle talk of advancing good, without practicing true virtue—
How can one attain the Gate of the Invisible and Inaudible,
Or comprehend the principle of nature and appearance?

The sages bequeathed scriptures like the radiance of sun and moon,
Dispelling darkness, revealing all things,
Illuminating every direction,
Enabling all beings to know what they knew not,
To see what they had not seen.
Such is the virtue of Heaven.

Our Most High expounded this scripture and teaching, like sun and moon,
Enabling all to know the path of ascending to truth and entering the Dao,
The way to escape the wheel of suffering and rebirth.
Such is the virtue of the sages.

The nature of all beings is akin to sun and moon,
Pervading the great void, unstained by the tiniest dust,
Soaring through empty space without hindrance.
Yet they know not the principle of establishing merit and cultivating virtue.
Obstructions arise like clouds,
Afflictions and karma stir,
Their luminous clarity is obscured,
And they wander into darkness.
Greed-blinded, they heed not the peril of the pit ahead;
Pursuing pleasure, they forget the sorrows of future calamity.

O assembly! How much better to establish merit and cultivate virtue,
Whose blessings are beyond measure!
They can deliver suffering souls,
Eternally prolong destiny,
Escape birth and death,
Attain the Dao and roam freely,
Verify sageliness and achieve perfection,
Ascend to the Three Clarities’ realm!

Hark!
The *Life-Prolonging Scripture’s Key* is the path of cultivating truth—
Essence and function both derive from this one scripture.

Hymn says:
Within the jade pot lies the profoundest mystery;
To know it, one must first bind the restless monkey-mind.
Diligently perfect merit and conduct in full—
Only then may sageliness and truth both be complete.
At the kalpa’s end, the flying immortal isle remains unharmed;
Beyond the world, how could it be confined to a Brahma-garden?
When one awakens to the ever-subtle principle,
At the ultimate depth of the mysterious, there are no words.

As the Elder Lord concluded his discourse,
Dragon-phoenixes and celestial immortals came to welcome him,
Returning to Jade Capital.
Then the Heavenly Master, having received the wondrous Dharma, declared:
“I vow to propagate it widely,
To transmit it to the virtuous.
If any man or woman receives, upholds, reads, or recites it,
I and the ten precept-enforcing immortal officials shall protect them wherever they may be.”

For Heaven is impartial,
And urges all toward goodness.
Where the Dao is present, blessings arise unseen;
When people are deluded by desire and follow its dictates,
Fortune aligns with destiny.
If one attains the mean,
Blessings come unbidden—
What need to fear calamity’s extremity?
If one loses the mean,
Calamity’s extremity arrives inescapably—
What hope then for blessings?

Good and evil causes are like a turning wheel’s spokes,
Like an echo following a sound—
How can one avoid their retribution?

Have you not seen:
Fragrant blossoms filling the railing cannot escape the frost of the ninth month;
Gold and jade filling the hall cannot avoid the hundred-year limit.
The human body is an illusory form—
How can it endure forever in the floating world?
As transgressions accumulate,
One is surely bound to the underworld’s eternal coils.
How much better to open the divine radiance,
Shattering the eight gates’ barriers,
Sweeping away the miasmic qi,
Ascending to the Three Realms’ palace!

Alas! Sentient beings, deluded by the manifold leaks,
Their natures burdened with manifold faults,
Rush ceaselessly through the surging waves,
Wander lost in the misty clouds, never awakening.
The Three Corpses and Six Ghosts rejoice in triumph,
While the Four Great Elements and hundred spirits grieve in sorrow.
The cloud-palace and immortal mansion are barred to them;
The desolate wilds must be their destined abode.
Their primordial truth scattered by the mournful wind,
Their spirit-souls adrift on the ghostly path,
Lifelong karmic debts appear before them—
In vain they repent, asking: “Where shall we go?”

Thus the Most High said:
“The highest virtue does not act as virtue;
The lesser virtue clings to virtue.
Those who cling are not called virtuous.”

Clinging to perverse views,
When one encounters right vision,
Can repel all demons,
Grasp the authority of Heaven and Earth,
Command the myriad spirits,
And wield the pivot of the Three Realms.

Yet the clamor of the dusty world is vast,
The delusions and obstructions towering—
How can one soar upon the azure clouds,
Or guide the mortal frame to the azure vault?
How can one, amid the five sufferings and eight difficulties,
Reach beyond the three isles and ten continents?
But within the square inch of the heart,
One may slay demons and banish them beyond the world’s bounds,
Serve loyal ministers in the imperial court,
Naturally ascending as a transcendent,
The Dao in harmony with spontaneity.
Coming and going, unbound and unhindered,
One roams freely and at ease.

This is the Most High’s method of aiding beings and delivering the deluded,
Pervading all directions,
Circulating through the Three Realms.
Thus he commanded the Heavenly Master to transmit it to all beings,
That all may escape suffering and karma,
Together enter the truth of the Dao.
Upholding and receiving it,
One penetrates the mysterious and fathoms the wondrous,
Gains unobstructed insight,
Transcends and enters the Dharma-gate,
And naturally attains the protection of the ten great immortal officials,
Guarding the body of the cultivator who embraces the One.

Hark! With single-minded resolve, smite and sever all demonic spirits,
Transforming the host of sufferings into the ten spirits of goodness.

*Ode:*
The myriad streams branch forth to nurture all beings,
As snow and moon gleam bright, rain clears to fair skies.
A thousand inlets churn with waves, a thousand moons grow dim,
Yet one stream’s waves stilled, a single orb shines clear.
In origin, the true state is the same—what difference lies between them?
Only delusion turns what is into what is not.
Then laugh at the falling blossoms, petals drifting,
While wild birds freely indulge their many passions.

Thereupon, bowing again to the Venerable Lord, he spoke this eulogy:

Within the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* commands the descent of true numinosity.

*Ode:*
The jade-text’s profound purport is most earnest,
Lest sentient beings fall into the night’s barred gate.
Thus the Supreme Mystery’s wondrous principle is expounded,
Pointing to open the stubborn mind, discerning form as emptiness.
Auspicious winds bathe the Yellow Blossom Palace,
The moon of wisdom illumines the Crimson Realm Pavilion.
Invoking sacred merit, neither within nor without,
The divine luminaries surely descend in direct response.

Within the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:
The household and dwelling secure peace and tranquility.

*Ode:*
Who can suddenly comprehend and awaken to the true scripture,
Dispelling mundane attachments to guard this form?

Cultivating nature to preserve the spirit, refining essence to nourish the blood,
Firming the root by forsaking desire, harmonizing qi and numinosity.
The Mud-Pill Palace set in motion reveals the bright moon,
The Sea of Fluids responds by capturing the mirrored stars.
Should the six senses be subdued, no ills or evils arise,
Naturally the dwelling aligns and secures peace.

Within the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:
Parents are preserved in long life.

*Ode:*
Diligently cultivate the wondrous form, the body luminously complete,
Let not the square inch of the heart be stained by dust or grime.
Silently enact the immortal’s deeds,
Ceaselessly advance the workings of the Dao’s merit.
The Ten Flowers surely rise, marking the golden standard,
The Five Elders must inscribe the jade names.
All stems from the body’s observance of precepts and goodness,
Joyfully extending to nine generations, preserving long repose.

Within the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:
All aversions dissolve into dust.

*Ode:*
Simply abide in constant stillness and constant purity,
Heaven and earth attain tranquility, the ten thousand dharmas become clear.
The Spirit Valley endures, unfolding jade blossoms,
The elixir spoon yields golden crystals.
The treasure vase emits auspiciousness, dragons and serpents play,
The cauldron of longevity radiates light, startling ghosts and demons.
Should one seize the sacred merit and refine it ceaselessly,
Naturally all aversions dissolve into dust.

Within the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:
The myriad evils spontaneously return to rectitude.

*Ode:*
The mind-ape bound, entering the mysterious curtain,
The wondrous form adorned, from this its majesty arises.
Turning the Mysterious Pass, sealing the earth’s cavern,
Driving back the wondrous norm, seizing heaven’s mechanism.
The blade of wisdom slays all demons and devils,
The Dharma-seal proclaims might, specters grow scarce.
Vast and boundless, the heart filled with wind and moon,
The myriad evils bow their heads, returning to submission.

Within the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:
One’s livelihood attains contentment.

*Ode:*
The square inch of the heart cultivated, level and smooth,
Worldly entanglements wholly vanish, not a thread clings.

The Three Corpses’ schemes are captured by the mysterious principle,
The Six Thieves’ devices dissolve, their monstrous ferocity vanishes.
The winding Milky Way emerges, its moon bright,
The spring hues of the valley open, its winds pure and clear.
Who would know this as the livelihood of the Way,
Or willingly cultivate it to attain contentment?

Within the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:
The whole household naturally enjoys health.

*Ode:*
No need to rush through distant passes,
For those lost beyond the clouds, the Dao is hard to find.
The divine radiance illumines only the path of non-action,
The Dharma-eye ceases to gaze upon obstructing mountains.
The vermilion gates and jade towers are true creation,
In the joy of clear wind and bright moon, one roams free.
If one grasps the livelihood of the secluded hermitage,
Even the hermit’s sparse host finds peace.

Within the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:
Descendants preserve prosperity and glory.

*Ode:*
The empty, numinous terrace, its auspicious mists pure,
A boundless harmony pervades the vast expanse.
Cloud-capped peaks stand cold in the divine wind,
Smoke-wreathed cottages gleam under the bright moon.
The rustic flute plays an idle, carefree tune,
The shepherd boy sings the voice of Great Peace.
Since recognizing the joy of the mountain dweller,
The alchemical maiden and infant flourish in turn.

Within the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:
The five paths naturally open and connect.

*Ode:*
With governance and discipline, undertakings prosper,
Loyal hearts aid the state and assist the wise.
Never allow slanderers to consume the ruler’s bounty,
Ever permit meritorious deeds to serve as the emperor’s ministers.
Since the cosmos can enact true transformation,
The rivers and mountains should be solemn and clear.
Together we behold the august virtue of the sagely lord,
Every road unobstructed, celebrating Great Peace.

Within the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:
All evils are forever extinguished.

*Ode:*
Who would tame the unruly mind-ape and horse,
To prevent their reckless flight from ruining the journey ahead?
Facing peach and plum blossoms in the sunlit day,
One gathers life’s livelihood, retiring to the old capital.
How fine the mountain’s clarity after the rain,
Yet one frets when clouds darken the moon’s brilliance.
If only one could extinguish worldly passions,
How could evils ever arise of their own accord?

Within the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:
The six livestock thrive and multiply.

*Ode:*
Recognizing the alarm in fleeting vanities,
One should promptly turn away and abandon mundane attachments.
Though present matters may seem endlessly trivial,
When the mind is not set in motion, all is naturally pure.
Livelihood will not lack abundance if not neglected,
Achievements will surely come if not abandoned.
What other profit could one seek,
When the six livestock prosper and the master flourishes?

Within the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:
Illnesses find healing and recovery.

*Ode:*
Let not a single thought be bound by karmic ties,
With all passages harmonized, life is preserved and prolonged.
Do not allow true qi to be constantly depleted,
But let the numinous source be daily replenished.
Dragon and tiger cannot cease their strife,
Kan and Li do not spontaneously unite.
No need for herbs to usurp the spirit’s principle—
Disasters will surely vanish, and joy will reign.

Within the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:
Wealth and possessions are not wasted.

*Ode:*
This mysterious pearl is beyond price,
Yet all beings possess it and cannot retain it.
It is like the bright moon mirrored in the river’s waters,
Or the pure wind stirring the white autumn.
It is best to secure it firmly in advance,
Lest it scatter and become a later sorrow.
The golden gate and jade door should always be shut,
To prevent the wild ape from conceiving thieving thoughts.

Within the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:
Misfortunes never arise.

*Ode:*
Turning the light inward to extinguish the dust-heart,
Do not fail the mysterious gate’s resounding Dharma-voice.
Creation and transformation lie before your eyes,
Do not wander beyond the clouds in vain search.
The cold cliff’s moon shines bright, the mountain ape cries,
The valley’s trees bloom fragrant, the wild birds sing.
If one truly practices this Dao,
What disaster could ever intrude?

Within the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:
Ever preserve smoothness, benefit, and integrity.

*Ode:*
Do not treat the untainted as trivial,
But aspire to true emptiness and advance on the wondrous path.
Often rely on Red Pine for sustenance,
Ever follow the Azure Vault in its waxing and waning.
Parting the dense veil of yin clouds,
The radiant bright moon emerges in splendor.
Dispelling the dust’s clamor without a trace,
Joyfully one ever preserves smoothness, benefit, and integrity.

The Lord Lao said: Excellent, excellent! You may propagate the true teaching, bringing boundless blessings and benefits to all beings, that they may forever partake in supreme goodness.

*Explanation:*
The autumn sky clears at dusk, clouds absent,
The moon’s radiance shines bright upon the waterside.
Yet how fierce the raging wind’s sudden fury,
Churning waves scatter the jade-like orb.

Guard against the monkey-mind’s frivolous antics—tame it within the jade grotto;
Curb the horse-intent’s stubbornness—tie it beneath the dark mountain.
Beyond the wilds, spring grasses flourish;
Before the peaks, rare fragrances abound.
Yet if horse and monkey remain untethered,
They chase the fleeting scene in reckless flight.
When the realm’s illusions arise unprepared,
Amid the deep willow mist, one’s trace is surely lost.

By willow ponds and flowered bowers, spring gleams bright,
Luring mortals to wander and gaze.
Trusting their steps, they forget the hour’s late return;
Swiftly the slanting sun passes the riverside tower.

This floating life is but illusion—how can one bear the days and months as a tally?
Glory and disgrace are empty splendor—still more, the sigh for time’s flow like water.
To endure the creation of transgressions is to let the soul sink in the cold night;
To remain unenlightened is to let the spirit fall into shadowed yin.

Consider the golden bell hung high—if the wood is unstruck, the day ends soundless;
The precious moon hangs in the void—if clouds do not veil it, the night remains radiant.
Thus, if the mind does not stir, the nature abides in constancy;
If the outer does not intrude, the inner remains at peace.
With inner peace, the ten thousand dharmas grow clear;
With nature’s constancy, the myriad demons submit of themselves.
What darkness is left unilluminated?
What transformation cannot unfold?

Alas! You common folk, dull to your true nature,
Indulge in passions and desires,
Revolving endlessly through the six paths—
What virtue, what cultivation have you?
Willingly you sink beneath the nine springs.
By moonlit pavilions and pine streams, no thought of escape from the prison;
In the burning house, you but thrust your head deeper—
Ever in the sea of suffering, craving glory and disgrace,
You betray your true origin, swept along by the waves.
Ensnared by the dust’s leaks,
Bound to the cycles of arising and ceasing as pratyeka and śrāvaka,
Chasing scenes, lost in delusion—
Measuring causes by birth and death,
Bewildered, unrepentant,
You cling to the throng’s passions,
Sinking yourselves in bitter destinies, losing the human form.
When shall you again ascend the Dao’s shore?

By the Most High’s profound grace, the true canon is once more expounded,
Universally saving all beings,
That they may forever partake in supreme goodness.

Hark!

O Most High’s true and excellent Dharma words,
Universally bestowing boundless blessings upon all beings.

In verse it is proclaimed:
The wondrous, all-pervading form is inherently majestic,
The vast and mysterious grace knows no partiality.
All things partake in the true work of creation,
All spirits abide in the profound and hidden mystery.
Dragons and serpents possess treasures—yet these are not rare;
Heaven and earth show no favor—truly pitiable indeed.
Discern the principle of use within the useless,
Split open the chaos to reveal the subtle mechanism.

The Heavenly Master bows in reverence, giving thanks,
Receiving and upholding the teachings with faith.

Annotation:
The Dao pervades the ten directions,
Its blessings suffuse all things.
It nurtures and transforms all beings,
Uniting all kinds in perfect harmony.
Subtle as motes of dust,
Vast as heaven and earth,
It governs the warp of sun and moon,
The weft of yin and yang.
Embrace it, and it shines;
Turn from it, and it dims.
Hidden or manifest, it follows the moment’s need,
Adapting to each vessel’s measure.
Only the wise align with it—
It must not be shown to the unworthy.
Treat it lightly, and it will not be attained;
Revere it, and it will surely come.
Thus is the Mystery Gate established,
To discern the true and expose the false,
That all may ascend,
And none drown in the depths.
When merit is perfected and conduct complete,
The spirit soars to the immortal’s rank.
May all beings encounter the true teaching,
Take heed, take heed—
Let there be no duality, no duality.

In verse it is proclaimed:
A thousand scriptures, ten thousand treatises shatter delusion—
Why wait any longer to turn back?

Let the karmic sea from this day forth be calmed of its waves,
Let the mountain of transgressions hence be leveled and held steady.
Before the mind has reckoned for others,
First remove from the heart all self-serving gain.
When virtue and power are both perfected and merit complete,
One walks alone through mist and clouds, delighting in non-action.
*Tai Shang Xuan Ling Bei Dou Ben Ming Yan Sheng Zhen Jing Zhu Jie*, Volume the Lower, concludes.

#2 "直灵" is likely a miswriting of "真灵."

**Postface**

I have heard that the vast and august Heaven is most high and most distant—
No ladder can reach its heights, no path can enter its midst.
The Great Dao is most profound and most mysterious—
No reckoning can fathom its origin, no method can plumb its principles.
Thus, goodness is made the path to ascend to Heaven,
And scriptures the gate to enter the Dao.
Goodness opens the way to the celestial thoroughfare,
Scriptures reveal their hidden mysteries.
Without goodness, Heaven has no path;
Without scriptures, the Dao has no gate.
Therefore, scriptures are established to deliver the dead,
Teachings are bequeathed to open the way to life.
Yet what grace is greater than scripture?
What blessing is greater than goodness?

The sages bestow scriptures, giving boundless grace;
Ordinary beings uphold goodness, receiving boundless fortune.
All arises from the heart—
This is the source of life.
But if one merely encounters the mysterious text,
Flips through its pages without heed or reverence,
Fails to study it deeply or exhaust its meaning,
How is this different from one afflicted who seeks a physician,
Yet only recites the prescription without taking the medicine?
Or one who, upon the law’s enactment,
Understands its statutes but does not guard against wrongdoing?
Reflect upon this—
How can mere reading bring deliverance?

All who encounter this teaching should uphold and revere it,
That the icy prisons of the cold hells may melt,
The flames of the fiery mountains be quenched.
Then may one’s name be inscribed in the registers of Penglai and Langyuan,
The ledgers of Youfu and Luofeng’s captive souls be stricken,
All awakened spirits be delivered,
And together ascend the shore of the Dao.

My conduct is meager, my nature flawed—
I am no better than the deaf and mute.
Yet I have presumptuously composed this eulogy,
Marking the close of this scripture.
