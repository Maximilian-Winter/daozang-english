**Preface to the Four Masters' Ancient Dao Commentary on the Dao De Jing**

I, your servant, am a nameless rustic from the marshes, one who has never sought advancement nor cared for worldly gain.
Upon reaching adulthood, I became deeply enamored with the pleasures of tranquility and simplicity, delving into the arts of *Dan Jing* (内丹经, Inner Alchemy) and divination.
In my later years, I read the works of ancient scholars, pored over the teachings of the *Zi* (诸子, Hundred Schools), and probed the profound mysteries of *Zhuangzi’s* (庄子) *Dao*, finding meaning in every passage—truly profound and far-reaching.

Observing the interpretations and annotations of other schools, I found their words often frivolous and extravagant, giving rise to conflicting doctrines, where red and purple (orthodox and heterodox) are indiscriminately mingled. Alas, they stray so far from the original Dao of antiquity, losing its true essence—how lamentable!

Only the works of the four masters—*Zhuangzi* (庄), *Liezi* (列), *Wenzi* (文), and *Gengzi* (庚)—are the true teachings of the *Five Thousand Words* (五千言), passed down directly by *Laozi’s* (老氏) disciples, each expounding upon the same Dao with consistent intent.
The other commentaries, though numerous and verbose, merely rely on ink and speech for their claims, offering no substance, no grounding in truth—how can they compare with the four masters?

In my youth, I once followed the court and wandered the capital, where I had the fortune to encounter the lofty Dao.
The lecturers there touched lightly upon the *玄关* (Xuan Guan, Mystic Pass), yet spoke only of emptiness and voidness, unable to convey even a fragment of the true Dao.
Reflecting inwardly, I felt no guilt, for my own understanding of the Dao was deep and self-attained.
I wished to rescue the multitude from their manifold obstructions, to mourn the Way’s failure to prevail, yet feared that those ensnared in doubt and confusion might rise in noisy contention.
Thus, I gathered the four masters’ works, cited the authentic *Jing* (经), and compiled them into one volume—ten in total—
to dismantle the redundant claims of others, and named it *The Four Masters' Ancient Dao Commentary*.

I also wrote *Ten Volumes of Commentary on the Classics and Histories* (述经史疏十卷) to serve as its counterpart.
Now, by fortune, this discourse is complete.
I do not presume to rely solely on my own conjectures,
but hope it may benefit both those of my own time and as a lesson for all ages.
May those of goodwill not scorn it,
and in moments of rest, take up their brushes and record it directly.

Composed on the first day of the Year of *Jǐhài* (己亥, 1915) in the *Dàdìng* (大定) era,
by **Ke Houcai** (古襄寇才质), with reverence.

**Volume One: The Four Masters' Ancient Dao Commentary**

**Chapter One: "The Dao That Can Be Spoken Of" (道可道)**

This chapter in the *Nanhua Jing* (南华经, *Zhuangzi*) states:
*"The silent, unspoken teachings of Heaven and Earth—without action—are what the ancients held in highest regard,
and what the Three Sovereigns (三皇) shared in common."*

What did the ancient rulers of the world do?
They simply followed *Heaven and Earth’s* (天地) Dao of non-action.

In antiquity, the *Great Dao* (大道) was not named, and great eloquence was not spoken of.
The *Great Dao* was manifest yet not proclaimed,
and words were eloquent yet did not reach their full extent.
Who in later ages understood the unspoken teaching and the unspeakable Dao?
If any could grasp it, then this is the *Heavenly Treasury’s* (天府) Great Dao of non-action,
and the silent, unspoken teachings of Heaven and Earth.

Heaven’s nature is without desire,
and non-action brings forth transformation naturally—
no teaching, no speech.
The Dao that can be spoken of—
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经, *Dao Yuan* 道原篇) says:
*"The affairs of benevolence and righteousness arise from human contrivance,
responding to changes and moving with the times—
changes that come from the seasons, where nothing is constant.
Thus, the Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao."*

Not the constant Dao—
*The Dongling Jing* (洞灵经) says:
*"The later ages’ Dao of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, music, and human affairs—
the so-called ‘teaching that can be spoken of’—
is merely an adornment of words and a failure of governance,
not the constant Dao."*

The name that can be named—
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"The study of books arises from human speech,
which comes from wisdom—
yet wisdom is deceitful and false,
knowing nothing of the Dao.*
Those words inscribed on bamboo and silk,
or carved into metal and stone,
that can be passed down to others—
these are not the true treasures of the Dao.
Thus, the name that can be named is not the constant name."*

Not the constant name—
*The Dongling Zhenjing* (洞灵真经) says:
*"In later ages, many recite medical texts,
or study arts and crafts,
calling their spoken explanations ‘words that can be spoken of’—
mere clever embellishments, not the true words."*

Without name, there is the beginning of Heaven and Earth—
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"Without name, there is no form,
and the Great Dao without form is stillness and non-action.*
The Dao of constancy, the unspeakable Dao—
vast and profound indeed!
This is the *Heavenly Treasury’s* (天府) Great Dao without teaching."*

With name, there is the mother of all things—
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"With name, there is form,
and Heaven and Earth with form are stillness yet without speech.*
The constant speech, the unspeakable words—
vast and profound indeed!
This is the *Heavenly Treasury’s* (天府) Heaven and Earth without speech."*

Constantly without desire, one may observe its mysteries—
*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:
*"There is the Dao of Heaven,
which is honored through non-action.*
Heaven and Earth possess great wisdom,
yet remain detached and effortless.
The Great Dao is non-action,
its mysteries unfolding naturally."*

Constantly with desire, one may observe its perils—
*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:
*"There is the Dao of humanity,
which is humbled through action.*
Humans cultivate petty wisdom,
yet remain detached and effortful.
The Dao of humanity is action,
its perils born of contrivance.*
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"Action leads to harm and peril—
this is the end of contrivance."*

These two Dao—
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"Following Heaven is playing with the Dao,
while following humanity is mere worldly learning.*
*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:
*"The Dao of Heaven and the Dao of humanity—
how distant they are!
One must not fail to discern them."*

**Shared Origin—**
*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:
*"Unite differences to form the same."*
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"The Sage engages in teaching,
uniting hearts and aligning paths."*

**Yet with Different Names—**
*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:
*"Dissolve the same to form differences."*
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"The Five Emperors and Three Kings of later ages pursued different affairs and divergent paths,
the Five Emperors differing in Dao yet bringing ruin to the world,
the Three Kings differing in affairs yet adapting to the times and changing their words."*

**The Mysterious Unity**

*"The same is called the Mysterious."*

*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"The sages of antiquity harmonized their hearts with Heaven and their essence with the Dao—
this is called the profound, wondrous, and boundless Way of Non-Action."*

*"Mysterious beyond mysterious,"*
*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:
*"The Dao is deep beyond depth,
yet it gives birth to all things;
Divine beyond divine,
yet it refines all things.
The gateway to all wonders."*

*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"The Dao stands alone yet gives rise to ten thousand things—
thus, the roots of all affairs emerge from the single gateway of the Dao."*

*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:
*"All things arise yet no one sees their root;
they emerge yet no one sees their gateway.
Its coming leaves no trace,
its going knows no bound—
no gate, no door,
yet it moves freely in all directions.
The vast and boundless sovereign."*

---
**Chapter Two: The Unspoken Teaching of Heaven**

*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) speaks:
*"The Sage penetrates the numinous treasury,
becomes human through alignment with Creation,
holds the Mysterious Virtue in heart,
and transforms with divine swiftness—
without a word, yet stirring the world.
Thus, the Sage moves Heaven’s heart and transforms it."*

Therefore, the teaching of the unsaid is vast beyond measure,
the argument of the unsaid is the Way that is not a Way—
if one attains it, it is called the boundless Dao of Heaven’s treasury,
the Non-Action of Heaven and Earth’s silent teaching.
All things transform spontaneously,
requiring no partial completion.
To speak of "beauty" is to mar it—
the people detest what is not good.

---
**The World**

*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"Later ages ruled without the Dao—
they were the world’s bandits.
Action, though useful, cannot govern.
When the ruler acts, the people also act.
All know beauty when it is called beauty—*
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经, *□微明篇*) says:
*"Later ages knew learning was shallow compared to the Dao,
but the ancients did not know learning was shallow compared to the Dao.
Now, they know learning is external to desire,
but the ancients did not know learning was internal to nature.
Who in later ages knows that knowing learning is ignorance of the Dao?
Who knows that ignorance of learning is true knowledge of the Dao?
Thus, when all know beauty as beauty, it becomes evil.
It becomes evil."*

*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"The Dao cannot be heard with the ears—
hearing is not the Dao, but learning.
The Dao cannot be seen with the eyes—
seeing is not the Dao, but learning.
The Dao cannot be spoken with words—
speaking is not the Dao, but learning.
Thus, it becomes evil."*

*"All know goodness when it is called goodness—*
*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经, *□无始*) says:
*"The ancients did not know learning,
yet they were deep in the Dao.
Now, they know learning,
yet they are shallow in the Dao.
They do not know the inner nature,
but know learning as external desire—
thus, in the midst of purity, they sigh:
'The ancients did not know learning,
yet they knew the Dao.
Who in later ages knows that ignorance is true knowledge of the Dao?'
Thus, when all know goodness as goodness, it becomes ungoodness.
It becomes ungoodness."*

*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:
*"The Dao cannot be heard with the ears—
hearing is not the Dao, but learning.
The Dao cannot be seen with the eyes—
seeing is not the Dao, but learning.
The Dao cannot be spoken with words—
speaking is not the Dao, but learning.
Thus, it becomes ungoodness."*

---
**The Interdependence of Opposites**

*"Being and non-being generate each other,"*
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"The ruler’s Way lies in the interplay of being and non-being."*

*"Difficulty and ease complete each other,"*
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"The ancients governed with upright teaching—
easy and it would surely succeed.
Later ages governed with perverse teaching—
difficult and it would surely fail.
To abandon what is easy and pursue what is difficult
is to court failure—
thus, difficulty and ease complete each other."*

*"Long and short define each other,"*
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"In ancient times, the people were unspoiled,
and long and short did not contrast.
Later ages, with their actions, made long and short define each other."*

*"High and low incline toward each other,"*
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"In ancient times, the people were unspoiled,
and high and low did not incline—
light and heavy balanced, untilted, without overturning.
Later ages saw high and low incline toward each other."*

*"Sounds harmonize with each other,"*
*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:
*"The teaching of the Great Person is like sound to its echo."*
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"Like an echo responding to sound,
the ruler sings above, the people respond below."*

*"Before and after follow each other,"*
*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:
*"The teaching of the Great Person is like form to its shadow."*
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"Like a shadow mirroring form,
before and after follow each other."*

---
**Thus, the Sage**

*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"The origin of the Great Dao lies in conforming to Heaven.
The highest sages conform to Heaven.
To conform to Heaven is to follow the Dao of Heaven and Earth—
emptiness, stillness, and Non-Action—
this is called Heaven and Earth.
To dwell in Non-Action,*
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"The ancient kings of the Way dwelled in Non-Action.*
To practice the teaching of the unsaid,*
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"The ancient kings of the Way practiced the teaching of the unsaid.*

*"All things*
*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:
*"Now, when we count things by number, though they exceed ten thousand,
we call them 'ten thousand things' for the sake of naming and recitation—
thus, we say 'ten thousand things.'"*
*—are made yet not claimed,*
*The Nanhua Jing* (南华经) says:
*"Heaven does not give birth yet all things are nourished;
Earth does not give birth yet all things are transformed."*
*—born yet not possessed,*
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"The Dao gives birth to things,
yet no one sees what nourishes them—
thus, all things grow.
This is called the divine and boundless Way of Non-Action."*
*—done yet not relied upon,*
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"The Dao completes things,
yet no one sees what it does—
thus, all things are complete.
This is called the divine and boundless Way of Non-Action."*
*—and the deed accomplished without taking credit.*
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"To not take credit is to practice Non-Action.
Non-Action means no dwelling, no speech, no action.
The Great Dao is Non-Action—
its deeds are accomplished without knowing what is done.
Only by not taking credit*
*The Tongxuan Jing* (通玄经) says:
*"To not take credit is to dwell in Non-Action,
to move without action, to speak without words."*

Thus, it is not abandoned. *The Nan Hua Jing* says:
*"The Dao’s Non-Action makes talent arise naturally.
The Perfect Man’s virtue—
unadorned, yet nothing can separate from it."*

**Chapter 3: Not Exalting the Virtuous and Wise**

This chapter of *The Nan Hua Jing* (□ *Tian Dao Pian*) speaks:
*"In ancient times, the virtue of emperors and kings took Heaven and Earth as their foundation, Dao and virtue as their master, and Non-Action as their constant. Non-Action means governing the world with abundance.
Thus, the sage-rulers of the most ancient times ruled the world with empty hearts and full bellies—this was Non-Action.
They always kept the people ignorant, desireless, and without daring to act, not exalting the virtuous, the wise, or wealth.
Non-Action brings governance.
Not exalting the virtuous—
*The Nan Hua Jing* says:
*'In the age of the Great Dao and supreme virtue, the virtuous were not exalted, the capable were not employed. The ruler was like a fallen branch, the people like wild deer. They made the people not contend.'
Making the people not contend—
*The Tongxuan Jing* (□ *Xia De Pian*) says:
*'In later generations, human nature and disposition all desire to surpass others and resent those who outdo them. Desiring to surpass breeds contention; resenting those who outdo breeds grievance and contention. Grievance and contention arise, then the heart is disordered and qi reverses.
The ancient sage-kings retreated from contention and grievance—when contention and grievance do not arise, the heart is governed and qi flows smoothly.'
Thus it is said: Not exalting the virtuous, making the people not contend.
Not valuing hard-to-obtain wealth—
*The Tongxuan Jing* (□ *Shang Yi*) says:
*'The ancient way of governing a state led the people, not valuing hard-to-obtain wealth, not prizing useless things, making the people not steal.
*The Nan Hua Jing* says:
*'The ancients hid gold in mountains, pearls in depths—they did not profit from wealth.'
Not seeing what is desirable—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'The ancient sages did not see what was desirable; their hearts and spirits were still, thus they were without desire, making the heart not disordered.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'In later generations, rulers indulged in beauty, not restraining their conduct, and the state fell into chaos, accumulating to the point of licentious calamity. Thus, those who govern must be cautious in what they inspire.
*The Chong Xu Jing* says:
*'Later rulers’ licentiousness led to the people’s licentiousness, but the ancient sages were serene and desireless, and the people naturally remained simple.'
Thus, the sage’s governance—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'The foundation of governance lies in Non-Action. Thus, the sage’s governance is empty, still, and tranquil, cultivating the Dao of Nature, serene and without action, yet the world is governed.
Empty the heart—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'In governing, an empty heart attains the Dao. The sage empties the heart of all things, seeing insufficiency.
Seeing insufficiency, thus able to perfect virtue, while the extravagant do not endure.
Fill the belly—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'The ancient sages guarded the inner while not losing the outer, thus their chests and bellies were full and their cravings few.
Weaken the will—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'In governing, a weakened will attains the Dao. A weak will and strong affairs—calm and undisturbed, yet naturally attaining.
Strengthen the bones—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'The governance of the Perfect Man abandoned cleverness, erased artifice, thus aligning with the divine and boundless Way of Non-Action.
When the divine attains the inner, the five viscera are tranquil, thoughts balanced, sinews and bones strong, ears and eyes keen—firm and unexhausted, nothing they cannot reach.
Always keeping the people—
*The Nan Hua Jing* says:
*'The ancients practiced Non-Action, thus governed the world with abundance. The ruler above practiced Non-Action, the people below also practiced Non-Action.
Ignorant and desireless—
*The Nan Hua Jing* says:
*'The ancients aligned with ignorance, their virtue not departing. Aligning with desirelessness, the people remained simple.
Making the knowing dare not act—
*The Nan Hua Jing* says:
*'The ruler above must practice Non-Action to govern the world; the people below must act to serve the world—this is the unchanging Dao.'
Practicing Non-Action—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'Practice Non-Action, manage without managing, know the unknown.'
*The Nan Hua Jing* says:
*'The emperor’s duty lies in Non-Action—then nothing is ungoverned.'
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'The ancient sages were serene and without action, yet nothing was left undone. Serene and without governance, yet nothing was left ungoverned.'*

**Chapter 4: The Dao’s Effortless Flow**

This chapter of *The Nan Hua Jing* speaks:
*"The Dao’s effortless and harmonious qi nourishes all things.
It is everywhere, wherever it is, it exists.
In ants and crawling creatures, it does not fail to nourish and rear—why does the Dao humble itself to blunt their sharpness?
In tiles, bricks, soil, and stone, it does not fail to complete—why does the Dao, instead, further scatter their confusion?
In weeds and grasses, it does not fail to grow—does the Dao humble itself to soften its radiance?
In excrement, urine, and filth, it does not discriminate against filth—it equals them with dust.
Deep and vast, as if it might exist—
I do not know whose child this great form is;
it mirrors the Emperor’s primordial Heaven, the Dao’s qi.
The Dao’s effortless flow—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'The Great Dao’s yin-yang harmonious qi is pure and clear.
And its use—
*The Tongxuan Jing* (□ *Wei Ming Pian*) says:
*'The Dao’s effortless flow is used, yet it is not full.
Sometimes it does not overflow.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'The Dao—harmonious qi, effortless yet not full.
Deep, as if the origin of all things.
Blunting their sharpness—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'The Dao blunts sharpness—there is no cruelty or evil.
Dissolving their confusion—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'The Dao dissolves confusion—there is no contention or disorder.
Softening its radiance—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'The Dao softens its radiance—there is no grievance or resistance.
Equaling the dust—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'The Dao equals the dust—it unifies with filth.'"

The Dao abides as if it exists.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Heaven, through it, is clear—
serene and still."*

I do not know whose child it is.
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
*"I do not know whose child it is."*

It precedes the Emperor.
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
*"Ran Qiu asked Zhongni:
'Can the child of the formless Dao
be the ancestor of the formed Heaven and Earth?'
Zhongni said:
'If there is something that precedes Heaven and Earth in form,
is it not all things?
Things arise from things—
the Dao is not the maker of things.'*

**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth**
This chapter of *The Nanhua Jing (Zhi Beiyou)* speaks:
*"Heaven and Earth possess great beauty yet do not speak,
the four seasons have clear laws yet do not debate,
all things have their natural order yet are not explained.
Ancient sages observed Heaven and Earth’s effortless beauty,
grasped the natural principles of all things—
thus the sage does nothing,
the great sage takes no action,
observing Heaven and Earth’s effortless Way.
They do not teach the petty virtues of benevolence and righteousness,
nor the many words of artificial deeds,
treating the people as grass-dogs,
following the natural winds of the sage—
thus the world is governed."*

Heaven and Earth are not benevolent.
*The Tongxuan Jing (Natural Section)* says:
*"The Way of Heaven and Earth takes virtue as its master,
the Dao as its decree,
things self-regulate.
Most subtle within,
it does not honor rank through deeds,
nor demand ritual to be solemn—
thus the Dao stands without teaching,
its radiance shines without scrutiny.
The Dao stands without teaching—
it does not deprive people of their abilities.
Its radiance shines without scrutiny—
it does not harm their affairs.
Those who teach the Dao
act against virtue and harm things—
thus yin-yang, the four seasons, and the Five Phases
share the Dao yet differ in principle,
all things share sentiment yet differ in form.
The wise do not instruct one another,
the capable do not receive from one another—
thus Heaven and Earth are not benevolent,
treating all things as grass-dogs."*

Treating all things as grass-dogs.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Heaven and Earth do not act artificially—
they rectify the Dao, and things naturally arise.
Yin-yang and the four seasons do not create all things,
timely rain and dew do not nourish plants—
when divine resonance meets,
yin-yang harmonizes,
all things are born."*

The sage is not benevolent.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The sage establishes laws to guide the people’s hearts,
letting them follow their nature—
thus the living have no virtue,
the dead have no grievance.
Benevolence, love, righteousness—
these are narrow ways.
The narrow enter the great and are lost,
the near travel far and are confused.
The sage enters the great without losing his way,
travels far without confusion,
constantly empty and self-guarded—
this is called Heaven’s virtue.
Thus the sage is not benevolent,
treating the people as grass-dogs."*

Treating the people as grass-dogs.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The people follow their ruler like grass follows the wind,
their transformation is like wind swaying grass."*

Between Heaven and Earth,
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
*"Earthly resonance—this is the multitude of holes.
Resonance—
the Great Block exhales, its name is Wind,
blowing in myriad ways,
yet letting things be natural.
All things roar and cry—
who commands them?
It is as if they cast away their keys."*

*The Nanhua Jing* says:
*"Human resonance—this is the bamboo pipes.
Wind acts without force—
if it acts, all things roar and cry,
movement becomes sound.
A cool wind brings small harmony,
a gusting wind brings great harmony—
like blowing through human resonance,
bamboo pipes, or keys."*

Empty yet unyielding,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The highest sage follows Heaven’s empty stillness and effortless action—
this is the Way to govern Heaven and Earth.
Knowing the Way of empty stillness,
one can begin and end—
this is called Heaven and Earth."*

Moving yet ever emerging.
*The Chongxu Jing* says:
*"The Tang ruled the world,
wandering the broad streets,
heard children’s songs:
*'Establish the boiling people,
none but your extreme.'*
Not knowing, not knowing,
following the Emperor’s decree.
Tang asked joyfully:
'Who taught you this song?'
The child said:
'An ancient poem.'*

Many words lead to exhaustion.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Later generations know books yet the Dao declines,
know numbers yet virtue declines.
Those who rely on numbers labor without fruit,
those who rely on books and numbers
are born from clever speech.
Words arise from intelligence—
the clever are deceitful and false,
unaware of the Dao.
Many words lead to exhaustion—
better to guard the Middle."*

*The Chongxu Jing* says:
*"Qi and Lu abound in clever devices,
there are those skilled in books and numbers."*

Better to guard the Middle.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The foundation of teaching lies in removing petty achievements.
Those who embody the Dao
are at ease and unexhausted,
their spirit transforms effortlessly—
the world subtly responds.
This is called Heaven and Earth’s unspeakable teaching—
vast and boundless!
If later ages know this,
it is called the great Dao of Heaven’s treasury,
Heaven and Earth’s unspeakable teaching."*

**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit**
This chapter of *The Nanhua Jing* speaks:
*"The Great Dao is formless,
yet it gives birth to emotions, ghosts, gods, and the Emperor—
it generates Heaven and Earth.
Heaven receives one breath—
clear and empty, it governs its movement,
Earth receives one breath—
settled and tranquil, it holds its place.
Thus the Valley Spirit of Heaven and Earth does not die—
this is called the divine mystery of yin-yang’s primal mother,
the creative force.
The primal mother—
the gateway of yin-yang,
the root that moves Heaven and Earth.
Heaven is continuous, as if it exists,
Earth uses it without effort.
The Dao—
the root of Heaven and Earth.
The Valley Spirit does not die,
*The Chongxu Jing* says:
*'Heaven and Earth constantly generate and transform—
never ceasing to generate,
never ceasing to transform,
the four seasons—
the Valley Spirit does not die.'
This is called the primal mother.
*The Chongxu Jing* says:
*'The Great Dao constantly generates and transforms,
nothing it does not generate,
nothing it does not transform—
yin-yang—
this is called the primal mother.
The gateway of the primal mother,
*The Chongxu Jing* says:
*'The Great Dao’s yin-yang—
doubtful, its Way is unfathomable,
the gateway of the primal mother.'"

This is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
*The Chongxu Jing* says:
Heaven and Earth’s four seasons—
their cycles endlessly return,
never ceasing to return—
this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.

Continuous, as if it exists,
*The Chongxu Jing* says:
Continuous, as if it exists.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The Great Dao’s utmost subtlety—
continuous, as if it exists,
thus able to govern Heaven’s movement.
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
Heaven’s movement.

Used without effort.
*The Chongxu Jing* says:
Used without effort.
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
Earth’s use is natural.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Used without effort,
thus able to sustain Earth’s endurance.

**Chapter Seven: Heaven Long, Earth Enduring**
This chapter from *The Nanhua Jing* [☐ *Yang* Section] speaks:
The Great Dao—
the greatest of *qi*.
Heaven and Earth—
the greatest of form.
The Dao acts impartially;
Heaven and Earth are without favor,
thus able to endure.

Therefore, the ancient sages, when about to abdicate,
offered the throne to rulers who upheld Heaven’s impartiality,
covering all like the heavens.
The realm endured long,
their bodies perished yet they lived on,
their bodies abandoned yet they survived—
was it not because of their lack of favoritism?
Thus their favor was fulfilled.
Heaven long, Earth enduring.

*The Nanhua Jing* says:
Heaven covers without favor,
covering all without exception.
Earth bears without favor,
bearing all without exception.
Thus Heaven and Earth could endure long.

*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The Great Dao—
the greatest of *qi*.
Heaven and Earth—
the greatest of form.
The Dao acts impartially;
Heaven and Earth are without favor,
thus able to endure.

Because they do not seek self-generation,
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
As Heaven’s own height,
Earth’s own depth,
the Sun and Moon’s own luminosity—
why should they seek to prolong themselves?
Because they do not seek self-generation,
thus able to endure long.
Thus able to long endure.

*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Heaven and Earth go without favor,
neither repelling nor attracting,
thus able to endure long.

Therefore, the sages—
*The Chongxu Jing* says:
Tang and Zhao abdicated to Shun,
who did not refuse and accepted it.
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
Emperors and kings properly abdicated,
the Three Dynasties properly succeeded—
timing their era,
opposing customs was called usurpation.
When in accord with the times,
following customs was called the righteous path.

Delaying the times,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The Dao of Heaven and Earth takes the later as primary;
the sage follows the Dao’s retreat,
thus securing safety through retreat.

Yet their bodies perished first,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Retreat, thus able to lead—
this is what Heaven and Earth accomplish,
taking the later to gain the first.

Abandoning their bodies,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The Dao of Heaven and Earth takes the small as foundation;
the sage follows the Dao’s smallness,
thus securing protection through humility.

Yet their bodies survived.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Small, thus able to become great—
this is what Heaven’s Dao accomplishes,
taking loss to gain preservation.

Was it not because of their lack of favoritism?
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The ancient sages preserved with Heaven and Earth,
impartial and just.
Thus their favor was fulfilled.
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
The sages of old had no private virtue,
their lack of private virtue—
their lack of private fortune.

**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Good as Water**
This chapter from *The Tongxuan Jing* [☐ *Dao Yuan* Section] speaks:
Water’s Way—
above, it becomes Heaven’s rain and dew,
below, it becomes Earth’s moisture,
all things cannot but live,
all affairs cannot but succeed.
It bears Heaven’s gifts and gives to all,
nourishing all things,
sharing with Heaven and Earth—
this is called supreme virtue.

Water’s gentleness nears the Dao;
the ancient sages modeled Heaven’s goodness,
like water’s supreme virtue.

The supreme good as water,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
None are softer or weaker than water.
Water benefits all things,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Water’s Way—
above, it becomes Heaven’s rain and dew,
all things cannot but live.
And it does not contend,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Water flows without contention,
swift in departure yet not delayed.
It dwells where all despise,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Its blessings extend even to gnats,
yet it seeks no reward.
Thus it nears the Dao.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Water aligns with Heaven and Earth’s vastness—
this is called supreme virtue.
Water’s gentleness nears the Dao.

Dwelling is good in humility,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Water’s Way—
below, it becomes Earth’s moisture,
all things cannot but live.
The heart is good in depth,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Water’s breadth is boundless,
its depth unfathomable.
Giving is good in kindness,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Water enriches the world yet exhausts no virtue.
Speech is good in trustworthiness,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Water supplements what is lacking,
bearing Heaven’s gifts and giving freely.
Governance is good in order,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Water’s ebb and flow—
its excess is beyond measure.
Action is good in capability,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Water’s utility penetrates metal and stone,
strong enough to overcome all.
Movement is good in timing.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Water nourishes all things without precedence.

Only because it does not contend,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Water’s ability to fulfill Heaven and Earth’s supreme virtue
lies in its flexibility and reach.
Thus it incurs no blame.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Water’s Way—
all affairs cannot but succeed,
its extent endless, its depth boundless,
it encompasses all life,
benefits the people without exhaustion.

*The Dao De Jing: Four Children’s Ancient Dao Exegesis, Volume Two*

**Chapter Nine: "Holding and Filling"**
This chapter, from *The Tongxuan Jing*, speaks of the last age’s rulers—dukes and marquises—whose arrogance and extravagance cannot endure. *The Zhuangzi* says:
*"The ancient sages destroyed the reckless surge of ambition."*
Wealth and nobility, these two, are the surge of ambition.
If the heart remains undisturbed, it is upright.
Uprightness means emptiness, stillness, non-action—and yet nothing remains undone.

*"Holding and filling"*—
*The Zhuangzi* says:
*"Filled, it overflows—one must not indulge to excess."*
*"Do not push to the limit."*
*The Tongxuan Jing* (*Wei Ming* section) says:
*"Holding and filling—better to stop in time."*
*"Prodding and sharpening"*—
*The Zhuangzi* says:
*"Sharpened, it dulls—one must not indulge in arrogance."*
*"It cannot long endure."*
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Prodding and sharpening—it cannot long endure."*
*The Chongxu Jing* says:
*"Weighing harm and gain—better to stop in time."*

Gold and jade fill the hall—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Ancient sage-kings dwelled in fullness without overflow, thus enduring.
The last age’s overflowing perishes.
None can guard it."*
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Dwelling in great fullness without spilling, filled yet unlacking—
thus one long preserves wealth.
The last age cannot guard it—losing the world."*

Wealth and nobility bring arrogance—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Born noble, one grows arrogant; born rich, one grows extravagant.
The last age’s arrogant and extravagant perish.
They invite their own ruin."*
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Few are the wealthy and noble who, without self-restraint, do not perish."*

When achievement is complete and fame is secured—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Heaven and Earth reach their limit and reverse; fullness brings depletion.
The sun and moon are proof—
at zenith, they decline;
at fullness, they wane.
How much more so for mortals!
Retreat is the Way of Heaven."*
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"When a ruler grows arrogant, he indulges to excess—
none who do so escape ruin.
Thus, when achievement is complete, retreat is the Way."*

**Chapter Ten: "Carrying the Vital Essence"**
This chapter, from *The Zhuangzi* (*Tian Dao* section), speaks:
The six qualities—emptiness, stillness, softness, weakness, simplicity, non-action, purity, and naturalness—
these are the form of the Dao.
Heaven and Earth are balanced; virtue reaches its peak.
Thus, emperors and sages rest their thoughts and quiet their hearts.
Rest brings emptiness, stillness, non-action—and the world is governed,
nothing left undone.

Therefore, the divine persons of antiquity—true persons, perfect persons, sages, Daoists, virtuous ones—
embodied these six qualities:
emptiness, stillness, softness, weakness, simplicity, non-action, purity, and naturalness,
unmixed with things.
Their virtue was supreme, the Way of Heaven and Earth—
thus they were called divine and sage.
The truly authentic, through non-action, governed the world—
thus they endured.

*"Carrying the vital essence, embracing unity"*—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The divine persons of antiquity embodied the Dao in emptiness and stillness—
'emptiness' is the Dao’s dwelling.
Emptiness means the heart bears no burdens;
desires are not loaded—
this is the utmost emptiness.
Machinations and cleverness do not burden the sovereign’s heart;
unified, all affairs are complete."*
*The Zhuangzi* says:
*"The divine person rides the light—
with form, he perishes.
This is called the divine person.
Can he truly be unattached?"*
*The Zhuangzi* says:
*"The ancients aligned inwardly with the Dao, doing nothing.
Their unity made them companions of Heaven.
Nowadays, they conform outwardly but not inwardly—
doing much, they follow others."*

*"Focusing the vital breath, attaining softness"*—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The ancient sages embodied the Dao, guarding softness and weakness—
softness is the Dao’s strength;
weakness is the Dao’s power.
Softness and weakness are the Dao’s operation.
Accumulated softness becomes strength;
accumulated weakness becomes power—
without accumulation, this never occurs."*
*The Zhuangzi* says:
*"Sage governance—
officials act without losing propriety,
the capable are promoted without losing their talents,
all emotions and affairs are revealed,
actions and words are spontaneous—
thus the world transforms.
When the hands move, the fingers point—
people from all quarters come together.
This is called sage governance.
Can one be like an infant?"*
*The Zhuangzi* says:
*"The ancients transformed outwardly but not inwardly—
non-acting governed within, yet they did not act outwardly.
Nowadays, they transform inwardly but not outwardly—
acting outwardly, they do not govern within."*

*"Purifying and gazing into the mysterious"*—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The ancient perfect ones embodied the Dao, guarding simplicity—
'simplicity' means the heart bears no burdens.
Neither liking nor disliking—
this is the utmost simplicity.
Simplicity and ease—
this is Heaven and Earth’s balance."*
*The Zhuangzi* says:
*"The perfect person’s heart is like a bell—
neither repelling nor inviting,
responding to things without hoarding,
thus overcoming things without harm.
This is called the perfect person.
Can one be without flaw?"*
*The Zhuangzi* says:
*"The ancients governed inwardly without action,
yet did not govern outwardly with action.
Nowadays, they govern outwardly with action,
yet do not govern inwardly without action."*

*"Loving the people, governing the state"*—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The ancient Daoists embodied the Dao, guarding non-action—
'non-action' means guarding stillness.
Guarding stillness makes one king of the world.
Stillness is the Dao’s mirror.
Unchanging unity—
this is the utmost stillness.
So-called non-action—
does it mean things do not come when drawn,
or go when pushed?
Pressured, it does not respond;
moved, it does not stir;
rigid and stagnant, it does not flow;
rolled and grasped, it does not scatter.
Does this mean private desires do not harm the public Way?
Desires do not injure proper virtue—
thus ever empty, ever non-acting,
embracing simplicity, holding purity,
not clinging to things—
this is called non-action."*

Can one attain non-action?
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The ancients savored the Dao without abandoning it,
while the moderns abandon the Dao without savoring it.
To abandon the Dao and rely on learning is perilous;
to forsake virtue and employ talent leads to困境.

The opening and closing of the Heavenly Gate,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The ancient True Persons embodied the Dao, guarding purity.
Purity—this is the Dao’s essence.
Unmixed with things, the utmost purity.
Still, it aligns with yin’s closure;
moving, it aligns with yang’s opening.
To reach the point of no excess in pleasure—
then there is no lack of joy.
No lack of joy is the utmost joy—
this is how True Persons wander the Dao of purity.

*The Nanhua Jing* says:
The ancients, True Persons—
their sleep was dreamless,
their waking free of worry,
their spirit pure,
their soul unexhausted,
empty and tranquil,
thus harmonizing with Heaven’s virtue.
Purity unmixed—
this is the Way of nurturing the spirit.
The Way of purity
is guarded solely by the spirit,
so *sū* (素) means unmixed with anything,
*pú* (纯) means unblemished in spirit.
To embody purity and simplicity—
this is called a True Person.

Can one attain non-duality?
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Now, observing the ranks of True Persons above,
delving deep into the intent of virtue and Dao;
below, examining the common customs of the world—
this is enough to shame and disgrace the shallow and impure.

Clarity and openness in all directions,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The ancient virtuous embodied the Dao, guarding simplicity.
To have no worry, no joy—
this is the utmost virtue.
Confucius asked of the Dao, and Laozi said:
*"Rectify your form,
unify your gaze—
Heaven’s harmony will arrive.
Gather your wisdom,
rectify your measure—
the spirit will come to dwell.
Virtue will be your vessel,
the Dao will be your abode.
Your pupils like those of a newborn calf, without desire,
your form like withered wood,
your heart like dead ashes.
True and real, yet not scheming—
thus self-sustaining, boundless,
heartless in plotting,
clear and open in all directions—
can one attain non-knowing?"

*The Nanhua Jing* says:
The virtuous person—
dwelling without thought,
moving without deliberation,
not storing up right and wrong, beauty and ugliness—
all within the Four Seas rejoice in sharing benefits as ease,
find security in mutual provision,
lost as an infant separated from its mother,
wandering as one who has lost the path.
Wealth overflows yet they know not its source,
food suffices yet they know not its origin—
this is called the bearing of the virtuous person.

Can one attain non-knowing?
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The ancients of old were clear, entering simplicity,
returning to non-action, restoring purity,
upright without guile—
thus the people were easily guided.
Utmost loyalty restored purity—
the people had no deceit or concealment.
Now, those of later generations who govern through cleverness
labor their minds yet remain unclear;
those who govern through scheming
toil their hearts yet achieve no success.

The nurturing of life and its sustenance—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
These six principles of governance—
the ancient kings thus held the realm without action and yet prevailed.
The Dao generates and sustains without contrivance—
this is called the Mysterious Virtue.

To generate yet not possess,
*The Nanhuajing* says: To generate yet not possess.
To act yet not rely,
*The Nanhuajing* says: To act yet not rely.
To grow yet not dominate,
*The Nanhuajing* says: To grow yet not dominate.
This is called the Mysterious Virtue.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The sages of the Great Antiquity held the Mysterious Virtue in heart,
and their transformations moved like the divine—
no decrees issued, yet customs shifted,
mores transformed—
this was the silent teaching of the unspoken Way,
the boundless and vast.
Few know this teaching of non-action,
this Way of the unuttered.
How profound and great it is!
If later ages could but know this,
it would be called the Dao of Heaven’s Treasury, the Way of Non-Action.

**Thirty Spokes Converging at the Hub (Chapter Eleven)**
This chapter from the *Nanhuajing* [missing character] *Mati* [or *Mashui*] says:
In my view, the ancients who governed well did not rely on fixed rules.
The people of old had natural inclinations—
they wove and clothed themselves,
they tilled and fed themselves—
this was called harmony of virtue.
Unified yet without factions,
this was called Heaven’s release—
the people were pure and simple, without artifice or craft.
Later generations, the potters said:
“I excel in shaping clay—
round forms conform to the compass,
square forms to the square.”
The carpenters said:
“I excel in working wood—
curved forms fit the hook,
straight forms align with the plumb.”
Yet clay and wood by nature do not seek to conform to compass, square, hook, or plumb—
and yet ages praise them as “the potter and carpenter excel in shaping clay and wood.”
Thus, they fostered artifice and deceit—
this too is how later rulers, teaching the crafts of earth and wood,
exceeded in artifice and deceit.
In ancient times, white jade was left uncarved—
who would make it into *gui* or *zhang*?
Pure simplicity was left unbroken—
who would carve it into sacrificial vessels?
Thus, to ruin simplicity for tools—
this was the excess of later artisans’ craft.
*The Dongling Jing* says:
In the age of perfect governance,
plain and undyed carriages and garments made people envious,
desires were sparse and light—
people took joy in their labor and service.
This was the foundation of governing the state.
In the decadent later ages,
ornate and elaborate carriages and garments made the vulgar emulate them—
people lost sincerity and purity, shaming simplicity while valuing extravagance.
To shame simplicity and value extravagance—
this is called the *fufu* (floating and insubstantial),
the ladder to a state’s ruin.
Thus, in later ages, the Five Emperors introduced carriages, dwellings, and the three implements—
they shamed simplicity and valued extravagance.

Thirty spokes converge at one hub,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
In ancient governance, artisans did not indulge in excess craft—
their carriages were plain and uncarved,
thirty spokes converged at one hub.
When their essence was absent,
the carriage’s use emerged.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Later artisans indulged in elaborate craft—
carriages became extravagantly carved,
taking years to complete,
benefiting expense more than use.
To mold clay into vessels,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
In ancient governance, artisans did not indulge in excess craft—
their vessels were plain and undecorated.
When their essence was absent,
the vessel’s use emerged.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Later artisans indulged in elaborate craft—
vessels became excessively carved and inlaid,
taking years to complete,
benefiting expense more than use.
To pierce doors and windows for dwellings,
*The Nanhuajing* says:
Anciently, they dwelled in nests and caves—
called the *Youcang* (Nest-Dwelling) clan,
eating acorns and chestnuts by day,
sheltering in trees by night.
When their essence was absent,
the dwelling’s use emerged.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Later, under a single ruler’s authority,
they exhausted the people’s strength to indulge the senses—
their ambitions fixed on palaces, pavilions, ponds, and enclosures.
*The Dongling Jing* says:
To seize control of affairs through earthworks—
this is called great calamity.
*The Chongxu Jing* says:
Qi and Lu abounded in ingenuity,
with masters of earth and wood.
Thus, they took what was present as profit—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Now, shaped tools serve their purposes.
To serve purposes is to complete tools.
Thus, labor yields profit,
but useful tools destroy the Way.
To take what is absent as use—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The ancient Way was formless—
this was the beginning.
The beginning was simplicity.
Thus, the unnamed was taken as use—
to use simplicity is to avoid tools.

**The Chapter of the Five Colors (Chapter Twelve)**
This chapter from the *Nanhuajing* says:
In ancient times, perfect joy lay in preserving life,
merely by preserving non-action.
But people of the later ages—
who among them could attain non-action?
What the world honors are wealth, nobility, longevity, and virtue.
What they delight in are bodily ease, rich flavors,
fine garments, beautiful colors, pleasing sounds.
What they despise are poverty, lowliness, and evil.
What they suffer are:
the body not at ease,
the mouth not tasting rich flavors,
the form not adorned in fine garments,
the eyes not feasting on beautiful colors,
the ears not hearing pleasing sounds.
If these are not obtained, great anxiety arises—
fearing harm to the body,
they injure their essence and damage their nature—
how foolish and deluded they are!

Moreover, losing one’s nature has five forms:
One, the five colors dazzle the eyes, making them dim;
Two, the five sounds assail the ears, making them deaf;
Three, the five stinks assail the nose, bewildering the forehead;
Four, the five tastes dull the palate, making the tongue parched;
Five, taking and rejecting disturb the heart, causing the nature to scatter.
The finery of feathers and tassels—
this is the extreme of color;
The sounds of bells and drums—
this is the extreme of music.

The palate’s indulgence in sweetness is the extreme of taste.
These five extremes—color, sound, scent, flavor, and desire—
are all great harms that shorten the lives of the people.

This warns the degenerate rulers of the last age,
who indulge in sound and color, abandoning Dao and losing the world.

The five colors blind the eyes.
*The *Tongxuan Jing* [□ Nine Guards Section] says:
*"One: The five colors dazzle the eyes, making them dim."*
*The *Nanhua Jing* says:
*"The eyes behold the dazzling hues of brocade and embroidery,
and are thus bewildered, forgetting their purpose—this is called chaos."*

The five tones deafen the ears.
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Two: The five sounds assail the ears, making them deaf."*
*The *Nanhua Jing* says:
*"The ears are assailed by the clamor of bells, drums, pipes, and strings,
and are thus bewildered, forgetting their purpose—this is called chaos."*

The five flavors parch the mouth.
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Three: The five tastes dull the palate, making the tongue ulcerate."*
*The *Nanhua Jing* says:
*"The five stinks assail the nose, bewildering the forehead.
The five tastes dull the palate, making the tongue parched.
The mouth indulges in the flavors of grain, livestock, wine, and rice wine,
and is thus bewildered, forgetting its purpose—this is called chaos."*

Hunting and galloping madden the heart.
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Four: Taking and rejecting disturb the heart, causing the nature to scatter."*
Hunting and galloping disrupt the people’s seasons and exhaust their strength.
The degenerate rulers dissect fetuses and burn the altars,
overturn nests and shatter eggs,
burn forests and drain marshes to catch fish—
phoenixes no longer soar, and qilin no longer roam.
*The *Chongxu Jing* says:
*"The people of Handan, on the first day of the first month,
presented doves to Lord Jianzi, who rejoiced greatly and rewarded them.
A guest asked why. Lord Jianzi said:
‘On the first day, I release them to show my benevolence.’
The guest replied:
‘The people, knowing you wish to release them,
compete to capture them, and many die.
If you truly wish them to live,
you should forbid the people from capturing them.
Capturing and releasing them—your kindness does not compensate for the harm.’"*

Rarity in goods leads to misconduct.
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"In the degenerate age, those seeking wealth vie for the difficult,
and jade and pearls are coveted by all under heaven."*
The degenerate rulers quarry mountains, extract gold and jade,
dig for pearls and abalone, melt copper and iron—
and all things wither and fail to flourish.
Thus, the Sage says:
*The *Chongxu Jing* says:
*"Now all under heaven are bewildered by sound, color, scent, and taste—
who can rectify them?"*
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The foundation of rectification lies in abandoning sound and color.
The gentleman cultivates upright qi;
the petty man cultivates perverse qi.
To align internally with nature and externally with righteousness,
to move in accordance with principle without being enslaved by things—
this is upright qi.
To indulge in flavors and lust after sound and color,
without heeding future calamity—
this is perverse qi."*

For the sake of the belly,
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The eyes delight in colors, the ears in sounds,
the nose in fragrance, the mouth in taste—
all united in pleasure, never departing from desires of gain and harm."*
The ears, eyes, mouth, and nose know not their own desires;
the heart alone governs them, each attaining its fill—
thus, it is clear that desire cannot be exhausted.

Not for the sake of the eyes,
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The eyes delight in the five colors, the mouth craves flavors,
the ears lust after the five tones, the nose after the five scents—
the seven orifices contend, harming the one true nature,
daily drawing in perverse desires and exhausting the celestial harmony.
The body itself cannot be governed—
how then can one govern the world?"*
Thus, abandon these and take that.
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Thus, abandon these and take that—
and calamity from Heaven will not arise.
If one obtains this, forgetting that,
then blame departs and fortune arrives."*

**Chapter Thirteen: On Honor and Humiliation**
This chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* speaks of the ancients’ abandonment of turbulent ambition.
Name and profit, honor and display—these are turbulent ambitions.
If the heart remains undisturbed, then it is upright;
upright, it is empty, tranquil, and without action.

Tang yielded the world to Yú Yóu, but Yú Yóu refused.
He then yielded it to Zīzhōu Zhīfù, who said:
*"To be made king is acceptable.
Yet I suffer from melancholy illness and must attend to it—
I have no leisure to govern the world."*
The world is the heaviest of burdens,
yet he did not use it to harm his life—
how much less would he harm other things?
Only those who do not cling to the world
can entrust themselves to it.

Shun yielded the world, and Shàn Jiàn said:
*"I stand amid the cosmos,
wearing fur in winter and hemp in summer,
plowing and planting in spring to labor,
harvesting and storing in autumn to rest.
I rise with the sun and rest with the moon,
wandering freely between Heaven and Earth,
and my heart and mind find contentment—
why should I concern myself with the world?"*
Alas, the Master does not know me!
Thus, he declined and departed into the deep mountains,
and none knew his whereabouts.

How much more so the warring states’ rulers,
who contend for fame and profit,
ruining themselves and their nations—
for they take honor as their affliction.
One who can yield the kingship to entrust the world,
who values life and honors the body,
can thus endure long.

Honor and humiliation strike like a shock.
*The *Chongxu Jing* says:
*"Name is a guest; the body is the host.
Name is the guest of the body,
yet the foolish pursue only the guest.
If there is a name, there is honor;
if the name is lost, there is humiliation.
Honor brings ease and pleasure—
this aligns with nature.
Humiliation brings sorrow and suffering—
this violates nature."*

Treasure great affliction as the body.
*The *Chongxu Jing* says:
*"To cling to a name and burden the body
is to invite ruin and death—
how much worse than mere ease or suffering?"*

What is meant by honor and humiliation striking like a shock?
*The *Nanhua Jing* says:
*"When honor and humiliation are established,
then one perceives their affliction—
how can one not be cautious?"*

Honor is supreme,
*The *Tongxuan Jing* [□ Dao Original Section] says:
*"Wealth, nobility, and renown."*

「Having a name is honor and esteem, with the highest virtue as its pinnacle.
Shame is the lowly state,
*The *Tongxuan Jing* [□ Dao Original Section] says:
*"Poverty and obscurity lack a name."*

Without a name, one is lowly and shamed—
this is the fate of the base and despised.
To gain it is as if struck by a shock,
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Profit is the beginning of fortune,
yet profit and harm share the same gate."*

To lose it is as if struck by a shock,
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Fortune is the precursor of calamity,
and calamity and fortune dwell as neighbors."*

This is what is called *honor and humiliation striking like a shock*.
*The *Nanhua Jing* says:
*"Discern the distinction between inner and outer,
and clarify the boundaries of honor and shame."*

What is meant by *treasuring great affliction as the body*?
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Now, those who take the profit and harm of the Spring and Autumn era as great affliction—
they must not fail to observe them carefully.*

*My great affliction lies in this:*
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The will has desires,
yet forgets its afflictions."*

*For me, having a body is the affliction,*
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The foolish are bewildered by petty profit
and forget their great affliction."*

*When I have no body,*
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"If one does not seek a name, there is no exhaustion;
if one does not seek profit, there is no harm.
What affliction do I have?"*

*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The body’s completeness is its foundation;
wealth and nobility are but its lodging."*

Thus, *treasuring the body as the Dao for all under Heaven*,
*The *Tongxuan Jing* [□ Upper Virtue Section] says:
*"The ancients who could honor life—
though wealthy and noble, they did not let a name exhaust their body,
though poor and lowly, they did not let profit burden their form.*

*Now, those who receive noble titles from their ancestors—*
their life’s origin is distant indeed,
yet they lightly court its loss—
are they not bewildered by name and profit?"*

*Treasure the body as the Dao for all under Heaven,*
and one can entrust all under Heaven;
*Love the body as the Dao for all under Heaven,*
and one can lodge all under Heaven within it.
If one can entrust all under Heaven,

*The *Nanhua Jing* says:
*"King Danfu of the Great [State] resided in Yin.
The Di people attacked him,
offering tribute of silk, furs, dogs, horses, jade, and pearls—
all were refused.
The Di people sought only his lands.
King Danfu said:
*'To dwell with a man’s elder brother while slaying his younger,
to dwell with a man’s father while slaying his son—
I cannot bear it!*

*Let them occupy the lands themselves!*
*What difference does it make whether they serve me or another?*

*Moreover, I have heard this:*
*'Do not use what nourishes you to harm your nourisher.'*

*He departed with his staff and chariot,*
and the people followed in procession,
thus establishing his state beneath Qishan.
Truly, King Danfu of the Great [State]
can be said to have honored life.
He loved the body as the Dao for all under Heaven."*

*The *Nanhua Jing* says:
*"The ancients who could honor life—
though wealthy and noble, they did not let nourishment harm their body,
though poor and lowly, they did not let profit burden their form.*

*Now, the people of this age who hold high office and noble rank—*
they all fear losing it,
seeing profit yet lightly risking their lives—
are they not bewildered?"*

Thus, *treasuring the body as the Dao for all under Heaven*,
one can lodge all under Heaven within it;
*loving the body as the Dao for all under Heaven*,
one can entrust all under Heaven to it.
If one can lodge all under Heaven,

*The *Nanhua Jing* says:
*"The people of Yue slew their lord for three generations.
Kingzi Sou was distressed by this,
and fled to the Danxue Grotto.
When Yue had no lord,
they sought Kingzi Sou but found him not,
and followed him to the Danxue Grotto.
Kingzi Sou refused to emerge,
so the people of Yue fumigated him with mugwort
and conveyed him in a jade carriage.
Kingzi Sou grasped the reins and ascended the chariot,
gazing heavenward, he cried:
*'Lord! Lord!
Why must you not abandon me?'*

*Kingzi Sou did not hate being lord—
he hated the exhaustion of being lord.*
*If Kingzi Sou were such,*
he could be said to have not let the state exhaust his life—
this was indeed what the people of Yue desired as their lord."*

**Chapter Fourteen: "Seeing Yet Not Seeing"**
This chapter, *The Chongxu Jing* [□ Heavenly Auspices Section], speaks:
*"In ancient times, the sage followed the Dao of yin-yang and emptiness-nothingness,
to govern the manifest forms of Heaven and Earth.*

*Heaven and Earth, with their manifest forms,*
are born from the Dao of yin-yang’s formlessness—
thus, Heaven and Earth’s manifest forms arise from the Dao of yin-yang’s formlessness,
and so there is the *Taiyi* [Great Unity],
the *Tai Chu* [Great Primordial],
the *Tai Shi* [Great Beginning],
and the *Tai Su* [Great Primitive].

*Thus, the Taiyi is the beginning of the spirit,
the Tai Chu is the beginning of qi,
the Tai Shi is the beginning of form,
and the Tai Su is the beginning of substance.
When Heaven and Earth’s qi, form, and substance are complete yet separate,
it is called *Hun Dun* [Chaotic Primordium].
*Hun Dun* refers to Heaven and Earth’s mingling and separation in formlessness.

*Seeing yet not seeing,*
hearing yet not hearing,
pursuing yet not attaining—
this is called the *Great Dao*.
*The Dao has no form yet stands firm,*
and so it is called *natural*.
If one can shape the primordial transformations of antiquity,
the beginning of Heaven and Earth,
the mingling of yin and yang in chaotic formlessness—
this is called the *Tai Ji* [Great Polarity].
The eightfold principles of the Great Dao
are the first of its eighty-one chapters."*

**Seeing yet not seeing** is named *Yi* [Equality/Level],
*The *Chongxu Jing* says:
*"The Tai Chu is the beginning of qi,
and seeing yet not seeing."*

*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The Tai Chu has a name—
seeing yet not seeing its hue,
this is called the *qi of emptiness-nothingness*.
*Substance emerges from emptiness,*
and though formless, it gives Heaven and Earth their colors."*

**Hearing yet not hearing** is named *Xi* [Rarity],
*The *Chongxu Jing* says:
*"The Taiyi is the beginning of the spirit,
and hearing yet not hearing.
It is also called the *Tai Ji*."*

*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The Tai Ji has a name—
hearing yet not hearing its sound,
this is called the *ultimate subtlety of yin-yang*.
*Life emerges from nothingness,*
and though soundless, it gives Heaven and Earth their voices."*

**Pursuing yet not attaining** is named *Wei* [Faintness],
*The *Chongxu Jing* says:
*"The Tai Shi is the beginning of vital essence,
and pursuing yet not attaining."*

*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The Tai Shi has a name—
pursuing yet not attaining its form,
this is called the *subtle and mysterious state*.
*Form emerges from the faint,*
and though formless, it gives Heaven and Earth their shapes."*

These three—
they cannot be fully explained,
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The Great Dao of yin-yang,
in stillness, has no body, no hue, no sound—
thus, the Dao cannot be spoken of."*

The Dao is without inquiry,
inquiry without response.
*The *Zhuangzi* says:
"The Dao is without inquiry,
inquiry without response—
it cannot be spoken of.
The mind is perplexed and cannot know,
the mouth falters and cannot discuss.
Thus, it blends into oneness.
*The *Chongxu Jing* says:
*"Tai Su is the origin of substance—
when Heaven and Earth’s qi and form are present yet undivided,
this is called *Hun Dun* [Primordial Chaos].
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Before Heaven and Earth took form,
they blended into oneness.
Above, it was not bright,
below, it was not dark.
*The *Zhuangzi* says:
*"The Dao is formless,
prior to the Tai Ji yet not exalted,
beneath the Six Extremes yet not profound.
It cannot be named—
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The Dao, when most vast, has no form or measure,
the Primordial, when most vast, has no bounds.
Returning to nothingness,
this is called the *form of no-form*.
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The Dao is the harmonious qi of yin-yang—
this is the *form of no-form*.
Without substance’s image,
this is called *vague and elusive*.
*The *Zhuangzi* says:
*"The Dao of non-being,
without form or appearance,
dimly vast and empty—
all day you gaze yet see no color,
listen yet hear no sound,
grasp yet find no shape—
this is called the *vague and empty Dao*.
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The Dao of Heaven is vague and elusive, boundless,
far yet unending, near yet without limit—
this is called the *Great Dao’s essence*.
Approaching it, you see no head,
following it, you see no tail.
*The *Zhuangzi* says:
*"The Dao of Great Clarity
has no beginning, no end—
no beginning, no end at all.
Holding to the ancient Dao
to govern the present.
*The *Zhuangzi* says:
*"Ran Qiu asked Confucius:
*'Before Heaven and Earth existed,
could one know the ancient beginning?*
The Master replied:
*'Yes. The ancient Dao is like today’s Heaven and Earth—
no ancient, no present,
no beginning, no end.
To know the ancient beginning,
*The *Chongxu Jing* says:
*"Of old, the sages followed the Dao of yin-yang’s emptiness,
to govern Heaven and Earth’s forms.
Heaven and Earth arise from the Dao of yin-yang’s emptiness—
this is called *Dao Ji* [Dao’s framework].
*The *Chongxu Jing* says:
*"Thus, Heaven and Earth’s forms arise from the Dao’s yin-yang’s formlessness,
giving rise to Tai Yi, Tai Ji, Tai Chu, Tai Shi, Tai Su—
this is called *Dao Ji* [Dao’s framework].

**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Virtuous Scholar**
This chapter from the *Tongxuan Jing* [Guard Weakness Section] says:
*"Of old, the Three Sovereigns had a warning vessel called the *You Zhi*—
when empty, it stood upright;
when full, it overturned.
Things at their peak decline,
the sun at zenith moves,
the moon at full wanes,
music ending turns to sorrow.
Thus, the wise and learned guard with simplicity,
the many-knowing and eloquent guard with restraint,
those who bestow virtue widely guard with modesty,
the mighty and bold guard with caution,
the wealthy and noble guard with frugality.
These seven principles
are how the ancient kings governed without action,
thus enduring forever.
Those who follow this Dao do not seek fullness—
only by not seeking fullness
does one avoid ruin when new things arise.
The ancient sages who governed well
held to the seven guards of humility.

The ancient virtuous scholar,
*The *Tongxuan Jing* [On Benevolence Section] says:
*"The ancient governors of the world
were subtle, mysterious, and penetrating.
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The sage holds the Dao,
empty, still, subtle, and mysterious,
thus perfecting virtue without action,
penetrating and vast, yet nothing is left undone.
Deep and unknowable.
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Without action yet nothing left undone,
thus governing the world with tolerance.
Only the unknowable
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"He who attains tolerance
acts without action yet achieves;
he who fails to attain tolerance
must act, and disaster follows.
Thus, he strives for tolerance:
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Thus, he governs the world with tolerance.
He says:
*'Cautious as one crossing a great river in winter,
hesitant as one fearing four enemies,
solemn as a guest,
melting like ice about to thaw,
plain as uncarved wood,
muddy as turbid water,
vast as a valley—
this is governing with tolerance.
Cautious as winter crossing,
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Cautious as one crossing a great river in winter—
not daring to move forward,
retiring without presuming to lead,
guarding retreat and yielding.
Hesitant as fearing four enemies,
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Hesitant as fearing four enemies—
fearing injury,
guarding softness and weakness, not daring to boast.
Solemn as a guest,
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Solemn as a guest—
humble, reverent, respectful.
Humble, reverent, respectful—
self-effacing, honoring others.
Melting like ice about to thaw,
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Melting like ice about to thaw—
not daring to hoard,
self-depleting, not daring to be firm.
Plain as uncarved wood,
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Plain as uncarved wood—
not daring to be complete,
self-deficient, not daring to be whole.
Vast as a valley,
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Vast as a valley—
not daring to overfill,
seeing insufficiency, not daring to exalt oneself.
Muddy as turbid water.
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Muddy as turbid water—
not daring to be clear and pure.
Not daring to be clear and pure—
dwelling in filth and humiliation, not daring to be fresh.
Who can settle turbidity with stillness, slowly clarifying?
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Turbidity settled with stillness, slowly clarifying.
Who can endure stability with prolonged motion, slowly giving life?
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The empty, when hollowed, slowly fills.
Those who preserve this Dao
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The Dao retreats, thus it leads,
guards softness and weakness, thus it prevails,
self-effaces, thus it is exalted,
self-depletes, thus it is firm,
self-deficits, thus it is complete,
sees insufficiency, thus it assists,
dwells in filth and humiliation, thus it is renewed.
Those who follow this Dao do not seek fullness."*

Not desiring fullness.
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Of old, the Three Sovereigns had a warning vessel called the *yòuzhī* cup—
when empty, it stands upright;
when full, it overturns.
Only by not being full
does one avoid ruin while preserving what is new and complete.
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Only by not being full
does one avoid ruin while preserving what is new and complete,
for the Dao acts without action yet accomplishes all."*

**Chapter Sixteen: *Zhì Xū Jí* (Extreme Emptiness)**
This chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* states:
*"Ancient worthies lived long without artificial exercises,
for they neither forgot the heart nor cultivated the spirit,
neither neglected the Dao nor guarded stillness—
this is the Way of Heaven and Earth,
the virtue of the Sage’s non-action.
Thus it is said:
*'Serene, tranquil, still, and without contrivance,
comparable to the evenness of Heaven and Earth,
the simplicity of the Dao’s virtue—
the Sage rests thought and quiets the mind,
plain and unadorned, serene and undisturbed,
so that worries cannot enter,
evil *qi* cannot assail.
Thus their virtue remains whole and their spirit undiminished,
and their years grow long.
Thus, pure and unmixed,
still and unchanging,
undisturbed and without contrivance—
this is the Way of nurturing the spirit.*

*The Dao acts without action,
can be transmitted but not received,
can be attained but not seen.*

*Pengzu obtained it from the Dao,
from the age of You to the Five Hegemons—
a span of eight hundred years.
The Venerable Laozi obtained it from the Dao,
living over five hundred years—
no one knows his end.

Ancient Sages, guarding stillness,
extended their lives to a thousand years.*

**Extreme Emptiness**
*The *Tongxuan Jing* [*□ Dao Yuan Pian*] says:
*"Ancient worthies valued self-cultivation over governing others—
nearly attaining the Dao.
Thus it is said: *Extreme emptiness*,
*steadfast stillness*.
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Those who guard steadfast stillness and act without contrivance
are those who guard stillness.*
*The *Chongxu Jing* says:
*"Nothing surpasses emptiness,
nothing surpasses stillness.
Emptiness and stillness—
this is attaining their abode.*

*All things arise together,*
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"All things arise together—
spring births, summer grows.*
*I observe their return.*
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"I observe their return—
autumn harvests, winter stores.*

*All things, teeming and active,*
*The *Nanhua Jing* says:
*"Spring’s breath unfolds, and all grasses sprout—
all things teem and move.*
*Each returns to its root.*
*The *Nanhua Jing* says:
*"When autumn arrives, all treasures mature in name,
returning to their root in stillness.*

*Returning to the root is called stillness,*
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Grasses and trees have roots—
thus, twice-bearing trees, their roots must be injured.*
*The *Nanhua Jing* says:
*"Uprooted plants wither past half their height,
yet they do not know their ailment.
Stillness can mend the sick,
massaging the eyes can rejuvenate the aged,
tranquility can halt sudden death.
Stillness is called *returning to the Mandate*.
*The *Nanhua Jing* says:
*"Now you are but a thing—
how can you return to your root?
It is easy—
only the Great Person can do so.*
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"In the ancient past, True Persons inhaled and exhaled yin and yang,
and all living things looked up to their virtue in harmony.
At that time, their essence was hidden and profound,
self-formed in purity and simplicity,
before purity dispersed and all things thrived in ease.*

*Returning to the Mandate is called constancy,*
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"From the august Fu Xi to Shennong to the Yellow Emperor,
dimly aware, diligently striving,
each sought to shed their childlike ignorance
and awaken between Heaven and Earth—
their virtue was harmonious but not unified.*

*Knowing constancy is called clarity.*
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"In the age of the Five Emperors and the Xia-Yin,
they grasped Heaven and Earth’s principles,
regulated the four seasons,
harmonized the yin fields,
and thus all people trembled in reverence,
listening and watching in awe—
governed yet without chaos.*

*In the age of the Three Kings—Xia, Yin, and Zhou—
their desires clung to things,
their brilliance was seduced by externals,
and their life and fate lost their truth.
Not knowing constancy,*
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"When the Zhou declined,
purity dispersed, simplicity departed,
the Dao became the falsehood of literature,
virtue became the ritual of music,
cleverness and artifice arose,
ancestral teachings doubted the Sage,
ornate deception coerced the masses,
and the world became muddled and chaotic.
Frivolous action brings ruin.*
*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"In the Warring States, the feudal lords rebelled,
the people took warfare as their trade,
disasters arose, calamities multiplied.
Raising armies was difficult,
sieging cities led to indiscriminate slaughter—
countless tens of thousands died in battle,
the aged and weak perished from hunger and cold beyond reckoning.
From then on, the world never again knew peace in life and fate.*

*Knowing constancy is called tolerance,*

*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:*
*"When stillness prevails, there is harmony;
when emptiness is embraced, there is flow.
The highest virtue is non-action,
and all things are contained within it.
To contain is to be impartial.*

*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:*
*"Those who seek to cling to reputation
must create affairs.
When affairs arise, they abandon impartiality for private gain,
forsake the Dao and indulge their desires—
thus, the Way of Impartiality prevails while private desires are blocked.
To be impartial is to be sovereign.*

*The *Nanhua Jing* says:*
*"In stillness, one becomes a Sage;
in action, one becomes a sovereign—
yet both are rooted in non-action.
To be sovereign is to align with Heaven.*

*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:*
*"The clear and empty—
that is Heaven’s luminosity.
Heaven’s luminosity is the Dao’s mirror.*

*The *Dongling Jing* says:*
*"The empty is the Dao’s essence;
the still is the Dao’s foundation.
The Dao endures eternally.*

*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:*
*"The Dao of emptiness and stillness—
Heaven’s vastness, Earth’s longevity.
Though the body perishes, it does not fail.*

*The *Tongxuan Jing* says:*
*"The root of nurturing life lies in emptiness and stillness.*

*The *Nanhua Jing* says:*
*"Great non-action governs the world,
small non-action nurtures the body and life."*

*End of Volume II, *Ancient Commentary on the Four Daoist Classics of* The *Dao/Way* and Its *Virtue/Power**.*

#1 *Essence of the Dao and Upholding Non-Action*: The character *Dao* was originally omitted; added according to the Qing-printed edition.

#2 *Ancient Shang’s Talent and Quality*: Some editions suspect the omission of the phrase *"Bo Le (伯乐) was skilled in treating horses"* after the word *"say."*

**Volume III, *The Essence of the Dao and Upholding Non-Action*: *Ancient Shang’s Talent and Quality***

**Chapter Seventeen of the *Tao/Way*’s Supreme Perfection**
This chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* states:
In ancient times, the sage-kings addressed flaws and reformed institutions,
completed matters and then altered their approach;
their excellence lay in harmony,
their shortcoming in *authoritative measures* (权).
Later generations’ Dao says:
Without laws, governance cannot be established;
without knowing *rites and moral principles* (礼义), laws cannot be formed.
Laws can kill the unfilial,
but cannot make people filial;
can punish thieves,
but cannot make people virtuous.
When the sage-kings ruled above,
they clearly showed what was good and evil,
guided the people with *non-punitive* (经非誉) instruction,
advanced the worthy and virtuous,
relegated the unworthy and base,
and laid aside punishments, never using them.
The Three Kings made the world fear punishments and dare not steal or plunder—
how could this compare to the ancient Dao’s simplicity and purity,
where there was no thievish heart at all?
Teaching should not be harsh;
removing harshness brings self-regulation.
If one does not know the principle of *non-action* (无为) for the individual,
but instead relies on *punishments and governance* (刑政) as a remedy,
this is no different from
digging a channel to stop water,
embracing firewood to extinguish flames—
the more you add, the more it overflows;
thus, *stirring to calm* (扬止沸) only makes the disturbance worse.
Those who know the principle of *non-action* governance
need only remove the fire.
Hence it is said:
*I uphold non-action and the people transform themselves,*
*I love stillness and the people become upright.*
The Supreme Perfection—
the people below know its existence.
The *Tongxuan Jing*’s *Natural Chapter* (□自然篇) says:
The Supreme Perfection is *spontaneous transformation* (神化);
in ancient times, the Three Sovereigns (三皇) nurtured this transformation,
issuing no commands yet the people followed.
When the sage-kings ruled above,
they clearly showed what was good and evil,
laid aside punishments, never using them—
this was the foundation of governance.
Courts were uncluttered, with no litigious disputes,
fields were cultivated, with no pretense of martial tools;
thus, the Supreme Perfection—
the people below know its existence.

**The Next Level:**
They were close to them and praised them.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
The next level was the Five Emperors (五帝), who issued commands,
preventing wrongdoing but without rewards or punishments.
The next level:
They were feared and reviled by them.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
The next level was the Three Kings (三王), who relied on punishments and rewards,
levying punishments to suppress violence,
granting rewards to encourage virtue.
The people feared punishments and dared not act wrongly—
this was not *law and order* (法令) being upright above,
but the people below submitting in fear;
this was the end of governance.
*Trust was insufficient,*
the *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*When words are the same, trust lies in their sincerity—*
*sincerity precedes words;*
*when commands are the same, obedience lies in their truth—*
*truth lies beyond the commands.*
The Xia ruler did not break his word,
the Shang people swore oaths,
the Zhou people made alliances.
Yet there were still cases of dishonesty.
The *Dongling Jing* says:
This shows that the world’s dishonesty
comes from rulers not being diligent and clear.
*It was because they valued words.*
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*When the ruler speaks, the subjects act;*
*when the subjects speak, the ruler acts.*
*When the ruler speaks, it is always applied;*
*when the subjects speak, it is applied contingently.*
Ancient sage-kings knew how to use *contingent measures* (权),
so when they spoke, it must be believed,
and their words must always be fulfilled.
When their deeds were accomplished and their purposes realized,
the *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*Ancient sage-kings*
*refined themselves inwardly*
*and governed the people outwardly;*
*when their deeds were accomplished and their purposes established,*
*they dwelled beside Heaven,*
*upholding non-action yet achieving all things.*
The people said they acted *spontaneously*.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*Sincerity is the word of the virtuous;*
*loyalty is the intention of the virtuous.*
When loyalty and sincerity manifest inwardly,
they move and respond outwardly—
this is the transformation of the worthy and sage.

---

**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao Declines**
This chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* states:
In ancient times, during the era of the Great Dao and supreme virtue,
the time of *He Xiu* (赫胥氏),
the people did not know what to do,
their actions had no fixed direction;
they carried their food in their mouths and walked joyfully,
they drummed their bellies and wandered at ease.
The people could thus remain pure and simple,
possessing loyalty and filial piety.
When the Three Kings (三王) suspended *benevolence and righteousness* (仁义) to soothe the world’s hearts,
the Great Dao declined, yet *benevolence and righteousness* arose,
and the six relationships (六亲) became discordant.
Then the Five Hegemons (五霸) bent and twisted *rites and music* (礼乐) to rectify the world’s punishments,
and *wisdom* emerged, bringing great *deceit* (伪).
States became chaotic and confused,
and the people began to strain for cleverness,
competing to gather *skillful advantages* (巧利),
unable to be restrained.
This was also the fault of the Three Kings’ *benevolence and righteousness*—
though they achieved minor success,
their teaching of cleverness and wisdom bred *thieves and deceit* (贼诈) among the people.
The Three Kings relied on *punishments and governance* (刑政) under the pretense of the Dao,
and took shelter in *righteousness* (义).
*Benevolence and righteousness* were the Three Kings’ *temporary dwelling* (蓬庐),
sufficient only for a night’s stay,
not for long-term residence—
they were not the enduring Dao.
When the Great Dao declined,
the *Nanhua Jing* says:
*In ancient times, during the era of the Great Dao and supreme virtue,*
*rectitude was natural, yet they did not call it benevolence;*
*mutual love was natural, yet they did not call it righteousness.*
*Following one’s nature was called the Dao;*
*attaining one’s natural endowment was called virtue/power (德).*
Thus, the Five Emperors’ Dao dispersed into human virtue/power (德).
*Benevolence and righteousness* arose;
the *Tongxuan Jing* says:
The Three Kings’ virtue overflowed into *benevolence and righteousness*,
and when *benevolence and righteousness* were established,
the Dao and its virtue/power (德) declined.
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
*The Three Kings’ governance of the world*
*was called "benevolence and righteousness through action,"*
*and their governance brought the greatest chaos.*
When *benevolence and righteousness* advanced the worthy,
the people turned to *mutual deceit* (相贼),
insufficient to enrich the people—
sons began to kill their fathers.

When *wisdom* emerged,
the *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*The Five Hegemons’ Dao narrowed,*
*later relying on rites and wisdom.*
Those who relied on wisdom
brought disorder to the hearts of the people;
the wise produced *fraudulence* (奸),
and *fraudulent customs* (奸俗) became the wind of *state collapse* (亡国).
*Great deceit* arose;
the *Nanhua Jing* says:
*When the Five Hegemons’ rites and music spread widely,*
*the seven states waged war with their armies,*
*and the world fell into chaos.*
When rites and music relied on wisdom,
the people turned to *mutual deceit* (相盗),
insufficient to enrich the people—
subjects began to kill their rulers.

When the six relationships (六亲) became discordant,
the *Nanhua Jing* says:
*The six relationships were discordant,*
*the old and young lacked order—*
*this was the concern of the common people.*
*Filial piety and kindness* arose;
the *Nanhua Jing* says:
*In ancient times, during the era of the Great Dao and supreme virtue,*
*filial sons did not flatter their parents—*
*this was the height of a son’s virtue;*
*serving one’s parents brought kindness and filial piety.*

When states became chaotic and confused,
the *Nanhua Jing* says:
*The court lacked loyal ministers—*
*this was the concern of chaotic states and the lords.*
*Loyal ministers* arose;
the *Nanhua Jing* says:
*In ancient times, during the era of the Great Dao and supreme virtue,*
*loyal ministers did not flatter their rulers—*
*this was the height of a minister’s virtue;*
*serving one’s ruler brought loyalty and steadfastness.*

**Chapter Nineteen: "Discarding the Sage and Abandoning Wisdom"**

The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
In ancient times, the sages established teachings and governed by first examining their ultimate outcomes, seeing how they fostered virtue. In later ages, when the people knew scriptures, the Dao declined; when they knew calculations, virtue declined; when they knew contracts, trust declined; when they knew mechanical arts, substance declined.

Minor cleverness harms the true; minor skill harms the Way; petty debate ruins governance; harshness injures virtue. In ancient times, the Great Way was unobstructed and straightforward, so the people were easily guided. In the age of perfect governance, all were at ease, so the lower ranks did not harm the higher. In the age of supreme loyalty, they returned to simplicity, and the people had no deceit or concealment.

When they composed written records, it was to oversee and manage all affairs—so the simple remembered, and the wise recorded events. But when [governance] declined, they used deceitful writings to exonerate the guilty and condemn the innocent.

Those who scrutinize the traces of ink and parchment do not know the principle of non-action as the root of order and chaos. Cunning and deceit took root, thieves and bandits multiplied, and the more the ruler desired, the more the people schemed.

To use writing and cleverness to generate solutions is like stirring water and hoping for clarity—it is difficult. Thus, to stop the boiling, one removes the fire. Those who know the principle of non-action as the root of governance say: *"I take no action, yet the people govern themselves."*

**Discard the Sage, abandon wisdom.**
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
And yet, do you delight in the sage? That aids the people’s artifices.
Do you delight in wisdom? That aids the people’s flaws.

Thus it is said: *"Discard the sage, abandon wisdom, and the world will flourish greatly. The people’s benefit will be a hundredfold."*
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
Scholars of writing are the source of speech. Speech arises from wisdom, and the clever, though skilled in deceit, do not know the Dao. The people become chaotic through falsehood.

**Discard benevolence, abandon righteousness.**
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
And yet, do you delight in benevolence? That disrupts the people’s virtue.
Do you delight in righteousness? That contradicts the people’s natural order.
The people return to filial piety and kindness.
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
Abandoning benevolence and righteousness, the people revert to filial piety and kindness, and thus the world’s virtue begins to harmonize in its primal unity. When people embrace their inherent virtue, the world becomes unerring.

**Discard cleverness, abandon profit.**
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
And yet, do you delight in ritual? That aids the people’s artifices.
Do you delight in music? That aids the people’s excesses.
Do you delight in sharp hearing? That makes the people indulge in sound.
Do you delight in bright vision? That makes the people indulge in color.
Then thieves and bandits will cease.
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
Benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music—selecting the worthy and employing the wise—are insufficient to enrich the people. The people are overly eager for profit, stealing even in broad daylight, digging through walls at noon. Thus it is said: *"Discard cleverness, abandon profit, and great thefts will cease."*

These three [principles]—
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
When the people’s strength and wisdom are exhausted, they rely on deceit. The more they scheme, the more falsehood spreads, and how can the common people avoid it? When strength is insufficient, they resort to deceit; when wisdom is insufficient, they resort to cunning. If deceit and falsehood prevail, whom can one blame? Blame the ruler’s fondness for cleverness and wisdom.

They say: *"The written word is insufficient,"*
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
To value ornate language, to discard substance, to drown in cleverness—this is when the people begin to be confused by superficiality. Without returning to their true nature, it is insufficient to enrich the people.
Thus, this is what is said today.

The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
Mountains produce gold, stones produce jade—
Yet they erode each other in turn.
Humans cultivate learning,
Yet it harms them in return.
Each pursues what they fancy,
Only to injure themselves in turn.

When the ruler is troubled, the people are unsettled;
When the ruler demands much, the people contend.
To govern through learning and then suppress learning—
It is like fanning flames and hoping they will not burn.
This is difficult indeed.

Thus, to stop boiling by adding more water
Only makes the boiling worse.
Those who know the root of governance
Remove the fire itself.

Therefore, abandoning sage-wisdom,
Discarding virtue and righteousness,
Rejecting the worthy and capable,
Erasing artificial conventions,
Prohibiting deceit and falsehood—
Then the virtuous and the base alike align with the Dao.

**Seeing the Unadorned**
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
In ancient times, the sage-governed
Practiced clarity and stillness—
True and unadorned,
Empty and effortless,
Returning to simplicity,
Unmixed with the world.

**Embracing Simplicity**
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
Ancient sages illuminated the unadorned,
Practiced non-action and returned to simplicity—
Simple and unadorned,
Yet none could rival their excellence.

**Few Private Interests**
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
In the southern lands of Yue,
There was a realm called Jiande,
Where the people were simple and unadorned,
Few in private desires,
Knowing to act but not to hoard,
Giving without seeking return,
Unaware of where righteousness lay,
Unconcerned with where propriety led—
Yet their reckless freedom
Aligned with the Great Way.

**Few Desires**
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
Ancient sages acted without effort,
Yet the people transformed naturally;
They were detached without desire,
Yet the people returned to simplicity.

**Chapter Twenty: "Abandon Learning, Be Without Worry"**
The *Tongxuan Jing* speaks:
In the latter ages, great academies are established to teach—
This is but a skill of governance.
When the Dao is attained, learning is practiced;
When the Dao is lost, learning is abandoned.

All things have their tension and release,
Their flourishing and decay.
When decline comes, they drift without return,
Indulging in lust and color,
Ignoring proper law,
Their corruption spreading to later generations,
Until kingdoms fall—
This is the result of their learning.

To lose the Dao and rely on learning is perilous;
To abandon virtue and employ talent is to invite hardship.
To govern through cleverness is to labor the mind without clarity;
To govern through cunning is to exhaust the mind without success.

When the ruler studies much, the people labor much;
When the ruler is troubled, the people are disordered.
To govern through learning and then suppress learning—
It is like fanning flames and hoping they will not burn.
Thus, abandon learning, be without worry.

The *Tongxuan Jing* [□Dao Yuan] says:
Books of learning are the source of spoken words.
Words arise from cleverness,
And cleverness is deceit and falsehood—
Unknowing of the Dao.
Thus, abandon learning, be without worry.

The *Nanhua Jing* says:
Abandon learning, discard books—
Then there will be no worries.

---
**Yes and Ah**
The *Nanhua Jing* recounts:
Laozi asked Nan Rongzi:
*"You come from Chu, do you not?"*
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
[Laozi] used cleverness in his questioning,
Yet Nan Rongzi, in his madness and bending,
Replied, *"Ah!"*
How far apart were they?

The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
In the latter ages, the nine schools of scholars
Clutch their texts,
Hold fast to doctrine and law,
Hoping to govern by them—
Like gripping a square handle to fit a round hole,
Seeking what is proper—
This is difficult indeed.

---
**Good and Evil**
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
Ancient practitioners of the Dao—
Deep practice was called *virtue and power*,
Shallow practice was called *righteousness and justice*,
Thin practice was called *rites and wisdom*.
How far apart are they?

The *Nanhua Jing* says:
Anciently, one must first attain *virtue and power*;
Cunning schemes were not employed.
One must return to Heaven’s way,
Govern through non-action—
This is the utmost in peaceful governance.

---
**What People Fear**
The *Tongxuan Jing* [□Shang Ren] recounts:
Wenzi asked:
*"What conduct makes the people love their ruler?"*
Laozi replied:
*"Govern them with due timing and reverence,
As if standing at the edge of a deep abyss,
As if walking on thin ice.
Between Heaven and Earth,
The good are my nurtured kin,
The unrighteous are my foes—
Thus, what people fear,
One must indeed fear."*

**It Cannot But Be Feared**
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
In ancient times,
The ministers of Xia and Shang
Turned against their tyrants, Jié and Zhòu,
And served Tāng and Wǔ instead.
The people of Hù Hóng
Attacked their own descendants
And returned to Shén Nóng.
Thus, what people fear,
Cannot but be feared.

**Endless Wasteland**
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
In the latter ages, to govern without the Dao
Is to harm the world.
To make an enemy of the people—
This cannot be done.
Endless wasteland.

---
**The Common Folk Rejoice**
The *Dongling Jing* says:
In the latter ages, when rulers employ people,
They value those whose ears hear well,
Whose eyes see clearly,
Whose words can be spoken—
Thus, the people compete to gain praise,
Adorning their speech to be heard—
Governance fails.

**Like Feasting on the Grand Sacrifice**
The *Tongxuan Jing* [□Ji Cheng] says:
Through diligent and laborious cultivation,
Ten days without food,
Yet it is like feasting on the grand sacrifice—
Learning without satiety,
This is how one sustains oneself.

**Like Ascending Spring Terrace**
The *Dongling Jing* says:
In the latter ages, when rulers employ people,
They value those whose ears hear well—
Then the people transport goods for profit,
Competing for praise.
They value those whose eyes see clearly—
Then the people display their forms and skills,
Striving to advance.
They value those whose words can be spoken—
Then the people practice flattery,
Adorning their speech.

**I Alone Fear**
The *Dongling Jing* says:
In ancient times, the sage-kings employed people
Who were valued not for what their ears heard,
Not for what their eyes saw,
Not for what their mouths could speak—
Yet the people acted effortlessly and naturally.

---
**Its Onset Unseen**
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
Scholars learn what they should not learn—
Until they attain the Dao—
Like an infant before it knows harm.

The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
A three-month-old infant,
Unknowing of gain or loss,
Unspeaking yet transformative—
How vast is this change!

**The Wanderer**

*"Buying Buying"*—as if having nowhere to return.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
To dwell is to act without purpose,
To move is to go without destination,
To undertake is to ride without aim,
To stir is to halt without intent—
This is called the Dao.
The common folk all have excess,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
The common people’s learning is laborious,
They listen yet lack clarity,
They see yet fail to discern,
Their offices are untrustworthy,
Their actions bring no order,
Their deeds achieve nothing.
Yet I alone seem abandoned.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
The Sage’s Dao is simple and humble,
Not listening yet clear,
Not seeing yet insightful,
Not speaking yet trustworthy,
Not acting yet bringing order,
Not doing yet achieving success.
I am but a foolish man’s heart—
Pure and unadulterated.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
The vulgar scholars of old,
The Sage did not follow.
The common folk are bright and discerning,
The *Dongling Jing* says:
In the latter ages, those who take people
By their sharp hearing and keen sight—
Their offices multiply yet governance is chaotic,
And all vie for profit.
I alone seem dim.
The *Dongling Jing* says:
In ancient times, those who sought
Unseen, unheard, unspeakable talent—
Their officials were upright yet diligent in virtue,
And the people transformed without words.
Alas, does the ruler know this?
I alone am obscure and veiled.
The *Dongling Jing* says:
In ancient times, when the Way was followed,
Those who sought unseen, unheard, unspeakable talent—
Their officials were upright yet diligent in virtue,
And the people transformed without words.
Alas, does the ruler know this?
Dark as if in eclipse,
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
The ancients’ Sages had hearts like dead ashes,
Obscure and dim,
No scheming in mind—
This was their *wuwei*.
Silent, yet as if endless.

The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
The heavens have light—
They do not fear the people’s dimness;
The earth has wealth—
They do not fear the people’s poverty.
Only by following the natural Way of heaven and earth,
Can one master the principles.
The common folk all have means,
The *Nanhua Jing*—Laozi says:
All take what comes first—
The sharp are destroyed.
All seek fortune—
The keen are blunted.
I alone am stubborn, like the vulgar.
The *Nanhua Jing*—Laozi says:
I alone take what comes last,
And receive the world’s defilements;
I alone bend yet remain whole,
And escape blame.
I alone differ from others,
The *Nanhua Jing*—Laozi says:
All take what is real—
I alone take what is void,
With depth as my root,
With restraint as my measure,
And laugh at cleverness without action.
Yet I cherish the nourishment of the Mother.
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
To always be broad and accommodating toward things,
Yet never diminished by others—
This can be called the utmost extreme.
Laozi! The ancient sage of boundless truth.

**The Sage’s Virtue and Form (Chapter 21)**
This chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* (from the "□至乐篇" [*Zhi Le Pian*]) speaks:
The Dao is formless yet gives rise to the formed heaven and earth,
Vague and indistinct yet never exceeds existence.
Indistinct yet vague—
Yet no image can be found.
Examining its Way, it first arises yet originally has no arising,
Originally has no *qi*, originally has no form.
Mixed amid the indistinct, vague, and void—
Void transforms into spirit,
Spirit transforms into *qi*,
*Qi* transforms into form,
Form transforms into life—
This is the interplay of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, the four seasons.
Thus it is said: *"Yǎo míng wú xíng"*—profoundly formless,
Yet within it is essence.
Its essence is most true,
Within it are the four seasons’ verities—
This is the Dao’s true essence.
The Sage’s virtue and form,
Follow the Dao alone.

The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
The Great Constant Dao,
Flows and permeates,
Never moves in vain,
With yielding and contracting,
With the ebb and flow of yin and yang.
The Dao, as a thing,
Is but faint and fleeting.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
Before heaven and earth took form,
Profound and dark,
Faint and fleeting.
Fleeting and faint—
Yet within them are images.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
Fleeting and faint—
Images cannot be fixed.
Faint and fleeting—
Yet within them is substance.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
Faint and fleeting—
Their application is unyielding.
Profound and dark—
Yet within them is essence.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
Again, obtaining the harmonious *qi* of yin and yang,
Only then can heaven and earth, the myriad things, arise and flourish.
Within it is verity.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
The Dao is formless—
Yet within it is verity.
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
The Dao has sentiment and verity—
This is the interplay of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, the four seasons.
From ancient times to now,
Its name does not fade.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
The four seasons as markers,
From ancient times to now,
Never changing or altering—
This is called the natural principle of heaven.
To observe the myriad people.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
The Dao stands and gives rise to the myriad things,
Thus the myriad things’ totality,
All pass through the Dao’s single aperture;
The myriad affairs’ roots,
All emerge from the Dao’s single gate.
How do I know the myriad people are thus?
Because of this.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
Yin and yang, the four seasons,
Give rise and form to the myriad things.

**Bending Preserves Wholeness (Chapter 22)**
This chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* (from the "□天地篇" [*Tian Di Pian*]) speaks:
The ancients who nurtured the world,
One person without desire—
Yet the world is sufficient;
One ruler without action—
Yet the world is transformed;
One sovereign profound and tranquil—
Yet the people are settled.
Unified in One,
All affairs are complete.
Thus the ancient Sages feigned crookedness and harm to their own abilities,
Embraced the ruler’s *wuwei* as the method
To govern the world,
And the myriad things transformed of their own accord.
Few officials yet governance was clear—
They did not boast of their many talents.

**Bending Preserves Wholeness (Chapter 22 continued)**

Bending preserves wholeness.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The bent seeks to stretch—
Bend an inch to stretch a foot.
The noble one does this.

Crookedness brings straightness.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The crooked seeks to straighten—
A small crook yields great straightness.
The noble one does this.

Hollow makes full.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The ancient skilled rulers modeled themselves on the rivers and seas,
Hollow and low, to achieve their vastness.
Those who follow this Dao do not desire fullness.

Worn becomes new.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Only because it is not full does it renew itself without ceasing.

Fewness suffices.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The affairs of the ancients were few.
What is meant by "few affairs"?
Grasp the essential to match the many,
Hold the simple to govern the broad.
Fewness is the economy of what is held—
Thus, with the Dao to guide it, even fewness suffices to govern.

Excess brings confusion.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The affairs of today’s people are many.
What is meant by "many abilities"?
Cultivated in both martial and civil arts,
Balanced in action and stillness,
Every move and pause fittingly placed—
Many abilities seem to govern all,
Yet the more they seek, the less they gain, unaware of their loss.
Thus, though many, they bring disorder.

Therefore, the Sage:
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The ancients—when unified in One, all affairs were complete.
The ancients knew One, and the world knew none unknown.
Later ages did not know One, and the world knew none truly.
Embrace One as the model for the world.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The ancients held to *wuwei* and One—
Hold One, and governance succeeds;
Lose One, and chaos follows.
One is the Dao of no preference,
The root of all things.
Thus, to lose One is worse than to have no ruler.
A ruler must hold to One to govern the people,
Yet tremble and fear daily,
Ever cautious—
Thus, through *wuwei*, the Dao of One is fulfilled.
What is held is strict,
What is governed is vast.

Not self-visible, hence clear;
*The Tongxuan Jing* [*Natural Section*] says:
Not self-visible, hence clear.

Not self-righteous, hence manifest;
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Not self-righteous, hence manifest.

Not self-praising, hence功 (*gōng*) achieved;
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Not self-praising, hence功 (*gōng*) achieved.

Not self-proud, hence enduring.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Not self-proud, hence enduring.

Only the non-contending:
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The ancient skilled rulers practiced *wuwei* and non-contention,
Thus none could contend with them.
Therefore, none in the world could contend with them.
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
Plain and unadorned, none could contend with their beauty.

Was the saying "Bending preserves wholeness" mere empty words?
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The ancient rulers’ Dao was not for having,
But for *wuwei*.
The wise do not take possession as their affair,
The benevolent do not take position as favor—
This is called *wuwei* and One.
Truly whole, returning to it.

*The Nanhua Jing* says:
The ancients valued *wuwei*—
Above, *wuwei*; below, also *wuwei*.

---
**Silent Speech of Nature (Chapter 23)**

This chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* speaks:
In the later ages, kings and feudal lords treat the world and their states as their own,
The myriad things as their livestock,
Harboring the world’s vastness,
Possessing the myriad’s abundance—
Their *qi* is full, their wills arrogant,
Like sudden winds and torrential rains, unable to endure.

Thus, the ancient Sages embraced softness and weakness,
Dared not the sudden winds and violent rains,
And so endured.

Modeling Heaven’s non-anger,
Following the Dao as good—
The world endures.

Silent speech of nature.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Those skilled in anger invite many grievances;
Only by following Heaven and Earth’s natural course can one attain sage wisdom.

Sudden winds do not last a morning,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Though the seas overflow, they do not exceed three days.
Sudden winds and torrential rains do not last a day,
Nor even a moment in midday.

Who says this?
Heaven and Earth.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Sudden winds and torrential rains—
They unleash the force of tyranny.
Heaven and Earth cannot endure them long,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Sudden winds and torrential rains do not last a day,
Yet cannot endure and vanish—
How much less so for humans?
*The Chongxu Jing* says:
Do not indulge in reckless joy or anger,
Nor favoritism in rewards and punishments.
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
The ancient Sages shed the burdens of virtue—
When anger and joy do not disturb the heart, it stands upright.
Upright, it is empty, tranquil, and *wuwei*—
Yet nothing remains undone.

Thus, following the Dao,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Therefore, the Sage models Heaven as good,
Does not act in wrathful anger to complete virtue,
And so endures.

The Dao aligns with the Dao,
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
Thus, above and below align in the Dao—
Above and below align in the Dao, and there is no lordship.

Virtue aligns with virtue,
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
Thus, below and above align in virtue—
Below and above align in virtue, and there is no servitude.

Loss aligns with loss.
*The Dongling Jing* says:
When blaming others’ faults,
Examine your own goodness first.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Anger controlled, grievances do not arise;
Anger from non-anger—
Anger without color—
This is called calculated gain.

Those who align with the Dao,
The Dao also gains them;
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The Dao and virtue—
Like leather and hide—
Far apart, they draw near;
Near, they grow distant.
Examined, they cannot be grasped;
Scrutinized, they are not empty.

Thus, the Sage is like a mirror—
Neither pushing nor welcoming,
Responding to things without hoarding,
Overcoming things without harming.

Those who align with virtue, virtue also gains them.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Virtue without accumulation yet without worry—
This is called *reaching its fullness*.

Thus, the good align weakness with strength,
Turn misfortune into blessing,
Pile stones to form mountains,
Gather waters to shape rivers,
Accumulate virtue to become kings.
Without accumulation, there is no such attainment.

Those who align with loss, loss also gains them.
*The Chongxu Jing* says:
How could joy and anger be recklessly expressed?
Joy returns, it must bring anger;
Anger returns, it must bring joy—
Both are unbalanced.
Now, my heart has neither resistance nor compliance.

Faith is insufficient,
*The Dongling Jing* says:
Complete faith brings peace to the world;
Lost faith brings peril to the world.
There is no faith at all.

*The Dongling Jing* also says:
For people lack faith,
Because governance is unjust,
And the ruler is not diligent and clear.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: "The Lame Do Not Stand"**
This chapter of *The Nanhua Jing* states:
The Great Dao perishes through excessive distinctions;
Scholars lose the Dao through excessive methods.
Thus, Yang Zhu, Mo Di, Shi Kuang, Li Zhu,
Gong Tui, Zeng Shi, and those skilled in eloquence,
sensual allure, and varied pursuits—
though their endeavors differ,
they all meet the same fate of losing the Dao.

To pluck the strings of the *liu* and disrupt the six pitches,
To melt and sever the *yu* and *se*—
Plugging Shi Kuang’s ears,
And the world begins to hold its breath in silence.
To extinguish patterns and disperse the five colors,
To glue Li Zhu’s eyes—
And the world begins to hold its tongue in darkness.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: "The Lame Do Not Stand" (continued)**

Destroy the hook and line, abandon the compass and square,
Pluck Gong Tui’s fingers,
And the world begins to possess its own cleverness.

Sever Zeng Shi’s conduct,
Silence Yang Zhu and Mo Di’s mouths,
Reject virtue and righteousness,
And the world’s virtue begins to merge in mysterious unity.

Though one gathers virtue and righteousness—
Even if as skilled as Zeng Shi—
Though one gathers the five tones—
Even if as skilled as Shi Kuang—
Though one gathers the five colors—
Even if as skilled as Li Zhu—
Though one gathers the five flavors—
Even if as skilled as Yu Er—
This is not what I call *plunging into the Dao* or *excellence in virtue*.

What I call *excellence* is merely *mastery of the Dao through non-action*.

Now, losing one’s true nature through the five tones, colors, and true flavors—
Those who take or discard these five matters
Are all great harms to the people’s lives and deaths.
Yet Yang Zhu and Mo Di began to abandon the six tones and colors,
Deeming themselves enlightened—
This is not what I call *attaining the Dao*.

Those like Zeng Shi, Yang Zhu, Mo Di, Shi Kuang, Gong Tui, and Li Zhu—
All externally establish the illusions of cleverness, eloquence, allure, and skill,
And thus disturb the world—
Things the law has no use for.

**The Lame Do Not Stand.**
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
*"Fused toes and branch fingers on the hand—
These are useless fingers on a tree,
Emerging from nature yet extravagant in virtue.
Those who employ many methods in virtue and righteousness—
Are they not like superfluous organs?
Yet they are not the true path of virtue and the Dao."*

**The Crippled Do Not Walk.**
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
*"Hanging warts and dangling excrescences—
These are clustered useless flesh on the feet,
Emerging from form yet extravagant in nature.
Those who cluster many methods in the emotions of the five viscera,
Indulge in perverse and twisted conduct of virtue and righteousness,
And multiply the uses of cleverness and insight—
This is not the straight path of virtue and the Dao."*

**Those Who Self-See Are Blind.**
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
*"Those fused in clarity—
They disrupt the five colors, indulge in patterns,
Is not the dazzling of green, yellow, and variegated brocade?
Yet this is Li Zhu."*

**Those Who Self-Right Are Not Illuminated.**
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
*"Those excessive in hearing—
They disrupt the five tones, indulge in the six pitches,
Is not the clamor of metal, stone, silk, bamboo, bells, and great *lu*?
Yet this is Shi Kuang."*

**Those Who Self-Praise Achieve No Merit.**
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
*"Those who branch from virtue—
Plucking virtue to block nature and gain fame,
Forcing the world to play the *huang* and *gu* in service of unattainable laws—
Is this not Zeng Shi?"*

**Those Who Self-Commend Do Not Endure.**
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
*"Those fused in eloquence—
Stacking bricks, knotting ropes, weaving sentences,
Trapped in debates over solid-white and difference—
Is this not the empty praise of useless speech?
Yet this is Yang Zhu and Mo Di."*

**Regarding the Dao, *The Nanhua Jing* says:**
*"Thus, Yang Zhu, Mo Di, Zeng Shi, Shi Kuang, Li Zhu, and Gong Tui—
All amass minor achievements in cleverness, allure, skill, eloquence, and branch paths,
Yet they are not the utmost rectitude of the world.
I consume *The Nanhua Jing*:
Those ancient ones who rectified the Dao and nature,
Did not lose their innate nature and spontaneous life,
Thus aligning with the Dao—
They did not multiply branches and diverge,
In virtue, they did not stray,
The long did not exceed,
The short did not fall short—
They followed the natural rectitude.

Now, minor achievements in tones and colors—
These sever and extend human nature.
Thus, though the duck’s legs are short,
Extending them brings sorrow,
Though the crane’s legs are long,
Severing them brings grief.
Thus, what is naturally long should not be severed,
What is naturally short should not be extended—
No need to fear sorrow or grief from tones and colors."*

**Superfluous Conduct.**
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
*"To take life as a hanging wart or excrescence,
To take death as a festering ulcer or abscess.
In ancient times, when people contained their clarity,
The world did not melt away;
When people hid their hearing,
The world was not burdened;
When people contained their wisdom,
The world was not confused;
When people hid their virtue,
The world was not perverted.

Yet those like Zeng Shi, Yang Zhu, Mo Di, Shi Kuang, Gong Tui, and Li Zhu—
All externally established minor virtues
And thus disturbed the world—
Things the law has no use for.
Thus, those of the Dao do not dwell among them.*

*The Nanhua Jing*—Laozi says:
*"I am ashamed that virtue and the Dao are not practiced,
Thus I do not accept the perverse doctrines of minor achievements from Yang Zhu and Mo Di.
Therefore, Zhuangzi neither dared to uphold the petty virtues of righteousness,
Nor descend to the perverse conduct of Yang Zhu and Mo Di."*

**Volume Four, *The Four Children’s Commentary on the Ancient Dao*, *Ancient Sheng’s Collection of Talent and Quality***

**Chapter Twenty-Five: *The Primordial Mixture of Things***
This chapter of *The Chōngxū Jing* [□ *Heavenly Felicity Canon*] states:
The Dao/Way is formless and boundless, transforming into one *qi*.
One *qi* undergoes nine transformations and becomes the Primordial Chaos.
The Primordial Chaos is the origin of the forms of Heaven and Earth.
Thus, when things are in a state of primordial mixture,
When yin and yang unfold and divide,
Before Heaven and Earth were born,
The light and clear ascended to form Heaven,
The heavy and turbid descended to form Earth—
The Dao/Way gives birth to Heaven and Earth.

When things are in a state of primordial mixture,
*The Tōngxuān Jing* [□ *Passage of the Mysterious Origin*] says:
This refers to the state before Heaven and Earth came into being.

Before Heaven and Earth came into being,
*The Nanhua Jing* [□ *Southern Bloom Canon*] says:
The Dao/Way is formless,
Giving birth to Heaven, giving birth to Earth,
And existing before Heaven and Earth were born.

Silent and vast,
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
Only the Dao/Way is formless,
Dark and unfathomable,
Silent and boundless,
Its sound unheard.

Standing alone yet never changing,
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The Dao of yin and yang
Exists independently, giving birth to all things,
From ancient times to the present,
Never ceasing to transform.

Circulating endlessly without cessation,
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
Heaven moves in cycles, Earth remains firm,
The four seasons as its eternal framework.
Hard and soft intermingle,
And all things are born.
Thus it can be the mother of the world.

*The Nanhua Jing* says:
Where the Dao/Way exists,
There is nothing it cannot permeate.

*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
Taking Heaven as father,
Taking Earth as mother,
Heaven and Earth are the parents of all things.

I do not know its name,
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
I forcefully name it,
And call it the Dao/Way.

I forcefully name it the Dao/Way,
*The Dònglíng Jing* [□ *Canon of the Cavern Spirit*] says:
The Dao/Way is the wondrous operation of the natural order.
Filial piety is the supreme virtue of human Dao/Way.

The Dao/Way encompasses Heaven and Earth,
Nurturing all things,
Shaping their forms and kinds,
Distributing their nature and lifespan.
Its function is supremely real yet never serves as a storehouse for things,
Nor as an official for affairs.
It is the embodiment of effortless action,
Seeking through touch and perception,
Yet nothing can grasp its presence—
I forcefully name it the Dao/Way.

I name it forcefully as *Great*.
*The Tōngxuān Jing* [□ *Sutra of Sincere Essence*] says:
The Dao/Way originally has no sound,
The sages forcefully name it,
And call it *Great*.

*Great* is *Passing*,
*Passing* is *Distant*,
*Distant* is *Returning*.
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
The Dao/Way, before Heaven and Earth,
Has existed since antiquity.

*Passing* is *Distant*,
*Distant* is *Returning*.
*The Chōngxū Jing* says:
The Dao/Way extends from the farthest antiquity,
Returning to the present day.
Its years are beyond measure,
Heaven enduring, Earth lasting,
Their limits unfathomable.

Thus the Dao/Way is *Great*,
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The Great Dao/Way of yin and yang
Is the vastest *qi*.
It dwells beyond Heaven,
Supremely high without equal,
Supremely deep without bottom,
Enveloping Heaven and Earth without surface or core,
Empty yet encompassing all,
Circulating without hindrance.

Heaven is *Great*,
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The manifest forms of Heaven
Are the greatest of forms.

Earth is *Great*,
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The manifest forms of Earth
Are the greatest of forms.

The King is also *Great*.
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
None is greater than the Emperor-King,
Whose virtue matches that of Heaven and Earth.

Within the realm there are four *Great* ones,
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
And how can one know
That Heaven and Earth suffice to exhaust the domain of the four *Great* ones?
Yet the King occupies one of them.

*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
When the King is bright, the ministers are bright,
And the realm is at peace.

The King’s law follows Earth,
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
None is richer than Earth—
Spring *qi* arises, and all grasses grow,
Autumn’s harvest is right, and all treasures mature.

Earth’s law follows Heaven,
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
None is more divine than Heaven.

*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
Earth receives from Heaven,
And all things take form.

Heaven’s law follows the Dao/Way,
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The Dao/Way is supremely divine,
Guiding the revolutions of Heaven’s course.

*The Nanhua Jing* says:
The Dao/Way is formless,
Covering Heaven and Earth yet never contrived.

The Dao/Way follows Nature.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: *The Heavy as the Root of the Light***
This chapter of *The Tōngxuān Jing* states:
In the later ages, the kings and feudal lords,
Though possessing the power of ten thousand chariots,
Were not content with their wealth and authority—
Heaven’s riches and the world’s prosperity
Could not satisfy their desires.
They grew frivolous and covetous,
Light and restless, losing their foundation,
And thus lost the world.

The heavy as the root of the light,
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The sages of antiquity acted without doing,
And their transformation was rooted in weightiness, not lightness.
Maintaining weightiness to govern the light,
The world was at ease.

The still as the ruler of the restless,
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The sages of antiquity possessed the virtue of quietude—
They were tranquil and not restless.
Dwelling in stillness to restrain the restless,
The world was at peace.

The ruler is the root.
Thus the *junzi* [noble/princely person] walks all day,
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
With propriety as their conduct,
With music as their harmony,
Their benevolence and compassion naturally perfumed—
This is called the *junzi*.
The *junzi* thus govern the state,
And the worthy never fail to inquire
Into their labor and ease.

They do not abandon their baggage and supplies.
*The Nanhua Jing* says:
How dare the *junzi* govern lightly?
Though there are palaces and grand displays,
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The Dao/Way of the *junzi*
Is to cultivate oneself through stillness.

Dwell in serene detachment.

*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The *junzi*’s Dao/Way—
When still, the lower ranks are undisturbed;
The lower ranks undisturbed, the people remain orderly.
How could the sovereign of a realm of ten thousand chariots—
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The power of ten thousand chariots relies on all things for merit and fame,
With authority so grave, one cannot govern lightly—
Yet govern with levity toward the world?
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
If the power of ten thousand chariots acts lightly, merit and fame will not be fulfilled.
Lightness leads to losing one’s ministers.
*The Tōngxuān Jing*—Wénzǐ asked of the foundation of governing the state,
Lǎozǐ replied: *"The foundation lies in cultivating oneself.
Never have I heard of a state in chaos while the self is governed,
Or a state governed while the self is in disarray.*
If one governs lightly, one loses the foundation of sovereignty.
Agitation leads to losing sovereignty."
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
Even the power of ten thousand chariots is insufficient for gratification,
The wealth of the world insufficient for joy—
Yet agitated, with boundless desires,
Indulging desire loses the foundation.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Virtue of Benevolent Action**
This chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* speaks:
The virtue of the sovereign and emperor harmonizes with the effortless Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth.
This is to ride the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,
To let all things govern themselves while employing the effortless Dao/Way of humanity.
The foundation of virtue and Dao/Way lies in establishing the essential,
In the sovereign’s effortless action, the world is governed.
To always uphold the five virtues of effortless action,
To rescue humanity—when all are virtuous, this is called the essential mystery.
The five virtues: saving the people.
Benevolent action leaves no trace.
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The sages of antiquity acted without doing,
Their teachings spread without descending from the hall,
And yet transformation reached the four seas—
They acted without leaving a trace.
Benevolent speech leaves no flaws.
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
Later ages awaited commands through words,
And governing became difficult.
The sages of antiquity issued commands without speech—
The sages of old were thus teachers,
Moving the world with a single word, yet without uttering it,
Their hearts and actions were effortless—
They acted without transmission.
Benevolent planning requires no calculations.
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The sage unifies all things in one,
And all affairs are complete—
The sage acts without contrivance, without scheming,
Without deliberation, yet all is appropriate.
Benevolent closure requires no locks or keys, yet cannot be opened.
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
In ancient times, the sage-kings ruled above,
Making their preferences clear to the people,
Yet punishments were discarded and unused—
Orders were given, yet the people restrained themselves.
Benevolent binding requires no ropes or knots, yet cannot be undone.
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The sages of old did not impose laws or decrees,
Yet customs shifted naturally—
This was through their hearts and actions in the Dao/Way,
Without action, yet self-regulated.
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
In ancient times, restraint was not by ropes or cords.
Later ages relied on ropes and knots for firmness,
Thus their virtue declined.
Therefore, the sages—
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The sages of antiquity acted without doing,
Illuminating the world,
Holding the essential of the Dao/Way,
Grasping the essential to rescue the multitude.
Always rescuing people, thus no one is abandoned;
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The world’s affairs cannot be forced—
Follow their natural course, and thus no one is abandoned.
The *Dònglíng Jing* says:
Rescuing flaws is precious in reducing affairs.
Always rescuing things, thus nothing is abandoned.
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The transformations of all things cannot be rescued—
Hold their essential and return them, thus nothing is abandoned.
The *Dònglíng Jing* says:
Rescuing flaws is precious in a single decree.
This is called *clinging to clarity*.
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The Dao/Way can be hidden, can be manifest,
Can be obscure, can be clear—
Accumulating subtlety forms clarity.
Thus the virtuous become teachers for the unvirtuous;
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The sovereign is the people’s teacher.
The unvirtuous become resources for the virtuous.
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The sages of old skillfully employed the Dao/Way,
Using what people relied upon to establish merit,
Trusting their weaknesses to their strengths,
Governing many, occupying the essential—
Seeing virtue as if unable to catch up,
Seeing vice as if it were an omen.
Not honoring their teachers,
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
Teaching without weariness—this is how one governs the people.
Discarding worthy teachers and good friends,
Few would abandon virtue to become corrupt.
Not cherishing their resources.
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
Is it not that the teacher is correct and without error,
The teacher governs and there is no chaos?
This clarifies the principles of Heaven and Earth,
The nature of all things.
Though one may know the great confusion,
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The ancients did not indulge in trivialities,
Nor fall into great confusion;
Did not practice minor kindnesses,
Nor become greatly foolish.
In the later ages, though one knows trivialities,
One is greatly confused by the Dao/Way.
This is called the essential mystery.
*The Tōngxuān Jing* says:
The foundation of governing the multitude lies in one essential—
When the world is at peace, it depends on one person.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing the Heroic**
This chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* speaks:
In ancient times, how did the Dao/Way hide, yet true and false emerged?
It was because the Five Emperors of later ages hid the Dao/Way in petty achievements,
Thus falsifying the Dao/Way and making it untrue.
In the age of the Great Dao/Way and supreme virtue,
They dwelled with beasts and birds,
Their clans united with all things—
How could they know of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, music,
Or *junzi* and the petty?
In harmony with ignorance, their virtue did not depart;
In harmony with desirelessness, the people remained simple and unadorned.
Simple and unadorned, their nature was pure and genuine, and they governed themselves.
When the Five Emperors of later ages
Climbed and hung with ornaments, calling it benevolence,
Dragged their feet and bound their thumbs, calling it righteousness—
Then the world began to doubt the falsehoods of petty scholarly achievements.
The muddled and licentious became music,
The bizarre and perverse became ritual—
Then the world began to divide into laws, calendars, sounds, and colors.
Thus, the Great Dao/Way of the later Five Emperors scattered,
And they crafted books and tools for governing.
Knowing the heroic,
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
The Five Emperors knew the heroic,
And thus created the five tones.

---

The *Tongxuan Jing* [□下德篇] says:
The thunderous roar can be likened to bells and drums,
The changes of wind and rain can be understood through music and rhythm.
Sounds that can be heard can be regulated,
And thus the five tones are attuned.
By preserving its **yin** (feminine, receptive),
One becomes the **dissolution** (*xī*) for all under Heaven.

The *Nanhua Jing* says:
In ancient times, the five tones were not disordered—
Who then created the six *lü* (pitch pipes)?
By preserving its **yin** (feminine, receptive),
One becomes the **dissolution** (*xī*) for all under Heaven.
As the **dissolution** (*xī*) for all under Heaven,
One’s enduring virtue/power does not depart,
And returns to the state of the infant.

The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
The ancient rulers who excelled in governance
Modeled themselves on the **non-action** of the rivers and seas,
Becoming the **dissolution** (*xī*) for all under Heaven,
And their virtue/power did not depart.
Thus, the **Perfect Ones** (*zhìrén*) did not perceive what was desirable,
Their minds and spirits dwelled in harmony,
At rest they embodied virtue/power,
In motion they aligned with the Dao/Way.

By knowing its **white** (bright, manifest),
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
The Five Emperors knew its **white** (bright, manifest),
And thus created the five colors.
What can be seen with clarity can be obscured,
What can be discerned in color can be distinguished,
And thus the five colors were differentiated.
By preserving its **black** (dark, hidden),
One becomes the **model** (*shì*) for all under Heaven.

The *Nanhua Jing* says:
In ancient times, the five colors were not disordered—
Who then created patterns and hues?
By preserving its **black** (dark, hidden),
One becomes the **model** (*shì*) for all under Heaven.
As the **model** (*shì*) for all under Heaven,
One’s enduring virtue/power remains unerring,
And returns to the **Non-Extreme** (*wújí*).

The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
The governance of the ancient Perfect Ones
Was void, tranquil, and still—
They cultivated the Dao/Way of Nature,
And with indifference and non-action,
All under Heaven found harmony.

By knowing its **honor** (flourishing, prominence),
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
The Five Emperors knew its **honor** (flourishing, prominence),
And thus established laws and calendars.

The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
The greatest of all, Heaven and Earth cannot contain it,
The subtlest of all, divine brilliance cannot perceive it.
What can be observed in vastness can be measured,
And thus calendars and numbers were set.
By preserving its **humiliation** (abased, lowly),
One becomes the **valley** (*gǔ*) for all under Heaven.

The *Nanhua Jing* says:
In ancient times, white jade was not shattered—
Who then created the *guī-zhuāng* (jade tablets)?
By preserving its **humiliation** (abased, lowly),
One becomes the **valley** (*gǔ*) for all under Heaven.
As the **valley** (*gǔ*) for all under Heaven,
One’s enduring virtue/power is complete,
And returns to the **Uncarved** (*pǔ*).

The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
The ancient rulers who excelled in governance
Modeled themselves on the rivers and seas.
The rivers and seas act without striving,
Becoming the **valley** (*gǔ*) for all under Heaven,
And their virtue/power is complete.
They did not divide and contend for wealth,
Yet wealth was abundant.
The Sage was pure and unadorned yet did not scatter,
Indifferent and desireless yet the people remained simple.
The **Uncarved** (*pǔ*) scatters, becoming tools—
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
When the Five Emperors established laws and calendars,
Differentiated the five colors,
Distinguished pure and impure,
And tasted sweet and bitter,
Then the **Uncarved** (*pǔ*) scattered into tools.
They set forth **ren** (benevolence) and **yì** (righteousness),
And refined **ritual** and **music**—
Then virtue/power shifted into falsehoods.
The people adorned cleverness to dazzle the simple,
Employed deceit to attack their superiors,
And though some could uphold it,
None could govern well—
For cleverness multiplied while virtue/power waned.

The *Nanhua Jing* says:
In ancient times, purity and simplicity were unbroken—
Who then created the sacrificial ox and wine?
Virtue/power and the Dao/Way were not abandoned—
Why seek **ren** (benevolence) and **yì** (righteousness)?
Human nature and disposition were not straying—
Why use **ritual** and **music**?
Later ages shattered simplicity to make tools—
The fault of artisans.
They destroyed virtue/power to create **ren** (benevolence) and **yì** (righteousness)—
The error of the Five Emperors.
The Sage used them as **officials and leaders** (*guānzhǎng*).

The *Nanhua Jing* says:
The **Shu-Wei** (狶韦氏) obtained it from the Dao/Way,
To grasp the **non-action** of Heaven and Earth;
The **Fuxi** (伏牺氏) obtained it from the Dao/Way,
To follow the **Qi-Mother** (气母) of the Dao/Way;
The **Shennong** (神农氏) obtained it from the Dao/Way,
To rule through the **virtue/power of Fire** (火德);
The **Yellow Emperor** (黄帝) obtained it from the Dao/Way,
To ascend the realm of **Jingyun** (景云, "illuminated clouds").
Thus, the **Great Measures** (*dàzhì*) were not severed.

The *Nanhua Jing* says:
Hence, one ruler’s decree could govern all under Heaven—
It was like the **one breath** (*yīxī*) of the **Tang and Yu** (唐虞).
They knew the use of **accomplished persons** (*xiánrén*) for the benefit of all under Heaven,
Yet did not know their harm to all under Heaven.
Only through severance—
The outsiders knew this.

**Chapter 29: "The Manifest" (章第二十九)**
This chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* states:
In the **end times** (*mòshì*), kings and feudal lords
Treated all under Heaven as their own family,
And all things as their livestock.
They harbored the ambition of all under Heaven,
And sought the abundance of all things—
Thus, their **qi** was full yet their wills were arrogant.
The great contended with the small through warfare,
The small defied and oppressed the lowly,
And none could endure long—
Not in contention, not in the Dao/Way,
Not in the Sage, not in the Perfect Ones.

Earth clings to the low yet does not contend for height—
Thus it is stable and not in peril.
Water flows to the low yet does not contend for swiftness—
Thus it departs and is not delayed.

Thus the Sage acts without action and thus meets no defeat,
Acts without grasping and thus meets no loss.

Those skilled in military formations
Do not know the divine transformations of temple battles and strategic shifts.

Those who love war have never failed to suffer defeat,
Those who contend in battle have never failed to lose.
The skilled swimmer drowns,
The skilled rider falls—
Each perishes by their own fondness,
Thus, those who act meet defeat,
Those who grasp meet loss.
The Seven Kingdoms perished through warring for Heaven under Heaven.

To take Heaven under Heaven,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
A kingdom should not greedily seek what it seeks,
But receive it from Heaven under Heaven.
Not through self-taken virtue and righteousness does one obtain it,
But through giving it.

To contend for fame is to seek what is already possessed—
I see this as unavoidable.
I see this as unavoidable.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Though one grasps it, it will not remain.
Fame cannot be sought and obtained—
It is given by Heaven under Heaven.
What is given returns to Heaven under Heaven,
And what returns is **virtue/power**.
If one lacks **virtue/power**, the people will not return.
Without their return, the use of arms is perilous to the Dao/Way—
I see this as unavoidable.

Heaven under Heaven is a divine instrument.
*The Dongling Jing* says:
Heaven under Heaven’s divine instrument,
The emperor’s weighty station—
It cannot be seized.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Heaven under Heaven is a great instrument,
It cannot be grasped, cannot be seized.
Those who seize meet defeat.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Those who love fame have never failed to be struck down,
The skilled swimmer drowns—
Each perishes by their own fondness,
Thus it is said: those who act meet defeat.
Those who grasp meet loss.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Those who contend for gain have never failed to be exhausted,
The skilled rider falls—
Each perishes by their own fondness,
Thus those who grasp meet loss.

Therefore, things—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
Calamity and fortune share the same gate,
Gain and harm reverse each other—
One must not fail to discern them.
Some advance, some follow,
*The Chongxu Jing* says:
Some are long, some are short.
Some warm, some chill,
*The Chongxu Jing* says:
Some are fair, some are foul.
Some are strong, some are weak,
*The Chongxu Jing* says:
Some are joyous, some are stern.
Some are raised, some are ruined.
*The Chongxu Jing* says:
Some are right, some are wrong.

Thus the Sage—
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
To endure is not in contention,
To govern is not in sainthood.
Earth clings to the low yet does not contend for height—
Thus it is stable and not in peril.
Water flows to the low yet does not contend for swiftness—
Thus it departs and is not delayed.

Thus the Sage acts without action and thus meets no defeat,
Acts without grasping and thus meets no loss.

Avoiding excess,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The root of strength lies in guarding weakness,
Thus the Sage guards gentleness and does not grow strong,
And so can complete his kingship,
And Heaven under Heaven endures long.

Avoiding extravagance,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The root of moderation lies in rejecting excess,
Thus the Sage rejects extravagance and luxury,
Dares not be proud or wasteful,
And so can endure long.

Avoiding arrogance.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The root of avoiding arrogance lies in emptiness and nothingness,
Thus the Sage rejects arrogance and excess,
Dares not be proud or overflowing,
And so can endure long.

**Chapter 30: "Assisting the Sovereign with the Dao/Way"**
This chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* states:
The ministers of the Seven Kingdoms raised unrighteous arms,
Until corpses lay piled and blood flowed,
Clashing before one another.
Where wars arise, Heaven under Heaven falls into great disorder—
The path of loving valor leads to peril and ruin.

Arms are cruel instruments.
Warfare is a perilous affair.
Ringing bells to destroy oneself,
Burning candles to scorch oneself—
The brave perish by their strength,
The eloquent perish by their cleverness.
Men die violently, not by fate,
Crushing few against many,
Weak against strong—
Arms kill them together.
The path of loving war leads to peril and ruin.

Now the Seven Kingdoms’ rebellious ministers love war and battle,
And Heaven under Heaven falls into great disorder.

To assist the sovereign with the Dao/Way,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
In ancient times, ministers governed the state,
Ruled within their borders,
Practiced **virtue/power** and morality,
Spread benevolence and bestow favors—
This was the highest path.
They did not use arms to coerce Heaven under Heaven,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
In ancient times, deceit did not arise,
Peace and ease knew no strife,
Heaven under Heaven was at peace,
The wise had no place to display their cleverness,
The brave had no place to wield their might—
They did not use arms to coerce Heaven under Heaven.
Their affairs returned to goodness.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The Warring States resorted to arms for self-preservation,
Deceitful men flattered and schemed in secret,
Hastily provoking the ruler to use their #1,
And the chaotic aided their schemes.

Where the army encamps, thorns and brambles grow.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The Seven Kingdoms raised arms in difficulty,
No leisurely steps on the road,
No standing crops in the fields,
Thorns and brambles grow.
After a great army passes, there will surely be years of famine.
*The Tongxuan Jing [Weiming Section]* says:
Raising ten thousand soldiers costs a thousand gold daily,
After the army’s departure, there will surely be years of famine.

Thus the virtuous are resolute yet yield,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The advantage of arms is not sufficient to rely upon for strength.
They dare not take strength from it.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
In ancient times, the brave dared not act recklessly and thus lived.
Resolute yet not boastful,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
In ancient times, those who guarded gentleness and weakness
Dared not rely on strength,
Thus they could boast.
Resolute yet not arrogant,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
The ancient brave did not use force violently,
This may be called being one with the Dao/Way.
Resolute yet unavoidable,
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
When the enemy attacks and one is forced to act.
This is resolute yet not strong.
*The Tongxuan Jing* says:
In ancient times, those who guarded gentleness and weakness
Were the living—
Heaven under Heaven thrived.

「Things grow strong, then grow old. The *Chōngxū Jīng* recounts how Confucius spoke to Zǐlù, saying: *"Yóu, you can be brave but cannot be cowardly."*

The *Tongxuan Jing* states:
*"Martial valor dies by reckless strength,
Wits perish by clever scheming.
This is called not abiding by the Dao/Way."*

The *Tongxuan Jing* states:
*"There are those who die by violence, not by fate.
They provoke the multitude with their few,
They defy the strong with their weak—
All soldiers slay them,
For their arms are not in accord with the Dao/Way.
Not in accord with the Dao/Way, they die early.
Not in accord with the Dao/Way, they die early."*

The *Nanhua Jing* says:
*"Not serene, not content—this is not the Dao/Way,
Not virtue/power.
Not in accord with the Dao/Way, they die early."*

**Chapter Thirty-One: The Virtue of Fine Arms**
This chapter in the *Nanhua Jing* recounts:
In ancient times, King Zhao of the Wén dynasty delighted in swords. Three thousand sword-wielders stood at his gates, clashing day and night before him, with a hundred or more dying or wounded each year. Yet he never tired of it. The heir apparent, Prince Dàn, was troubled by this and asked Zhuangzi to counsel the king to cease his fondness for swords.

Zhuangzi saw the king and said:
*"I have three swords—let Your Majesty choose which to use."*

The king replied:
*"I wish to hear of these three swords."*

Zhuangzi said:
*"There is the Sovereign’s Sword, the Noble’s Sword, and the Commoner’s Sword.
The Sovereign’s Sword rectifies the Nobles—then all under Heaven submit.
The Noble’s Sword within the Four Seals* has none who do not yield.
The Commoner’s Sword, once drawn, severs life—useless for state affairs.

Now, Your Majesty holds the Sovereign’s rank yet favors the Commoner’s Sword. I humbly think Your Majesty underestimates its weight."*

*The Four Seals (四封) refers to the boundaries of a feudal lord’s domain.*

The king was suddenly lost in thought, ascended the hall in silence, and the attendants served him food. He took three mouthfuls before Zhuangzi spoke again:
*"Your Majesty, now seated and composed, the matter of swords is already settled."*

Thus, King Zhao did not leave the palace for three months, and all the sword-wielders perished in their dwellings.

Discussing arms, there are six ill omens—never a good omen, never to be used lightly.

The *Tongxuan Jing* states:
*"Arms are instruments of ill omen,
War is a perilous affair.
The most unauspicious of tools."*

The *Tongxuan Jing* states:
*"Those who delight in arms provoke the utmost calamity.
Things may even come to hate them,
For arms ravage the land, causing unrest among the ten thousand households.
They slaughter without cause—
The people’s resentment rises,
And things come to hate them.
Thus, those who abide by the Dao/Way do not dwell upon them."*

The *Tongxuan Jing* states:
*"The virtuous/powerful* seek the Dao/Way and virtue/power,
Not the frequent use of arms.
The virtuous/powerful* at rest honor the left—
The *Dònglíng Jīng* says: *‘Yang virtue/power abides on the left.’*
In war, they honor the right—
The *Dònglíng Jīng* says: *‘Yin punishment abides on the right.’*
Arms are instruments of ill omen—
The *Tongxuan Jing* states: *‘Thus, arms are not the tools of the virtuous/powerful.*’
Not the treasure of the virtuous/powerful.
When used unavoidably, the *Tongxuan Jing* states: *‘There are five uses of arms; the second is *yìngbīng*—using them when unavoidable.’*
Using arms unavoidably is called *yìngbīng*.
To win by *yìngbīng* is the fulfillment of Heaven’s Dao/Way.
Serenity and detachment are supreme—
The *Tongxuan Jing* states: *‘Serene without thought, detached without concern,
Nurturing wisdom through serenity,
Serene and content without boastfulness, attaining harmony.’*
To win yet not revel in it—
The *Tongxuan Jing* [□ *Shàng Rén Piān*] says: *‘Arms kill and wound—victory is not beautiful.’*
Arms are most cruel when they dwell in the heart—
*Mózhì* is the lowest.
Yet those who revel in it are those who delight in killing—
The *Tongxuan Jing* states: *‘The unrighteous arms of the Warring States reached the point where corpses piled and blood flowed in exchange—
This is delighting in killing.’*
Those who delight in killing—
The *Tongxuan Jing* states: *‘In the Spring and Autumn Period, those who raised arms for themselves were abandoned by the people.
Abandoned by the people, though great, they must perish.
They cannot fulfill their ambitions in the world.’*
For others’ battles, they cannot achieve kingship;
For their own gain, they cannot establish their merit.

Good omens honor the left—
The *Nanhua Jing* says: *‘The Dao/Way has a left.’*
Left is *yang*—
The *Nanhua Jing* says: *‘The Dao/Way has a right.’*
Right is *yin*.
The Left General* abides on the left—
The *Nanhua Jing* commentary says: *‘Left, yang—maintains life.’*
The Right General* abides on the right—
The *Nanhua Jing* commentary says: *‘Right, yin—brings death.’*
It is said to treat them with funeral rites—
The *Tongxuan Jing* [□ *Shàng Rén Piān*] says: *‘Treat them with funeral rites.’*
When many are slain, mourn with sorrowful tears—
The *Tongxuan Jing* states: *‘After defeat, mourn with sorrowful tears.’*
When victorious, treat them with funeral rites.*

*The Left General (偏将军) and Right General (上将军) are military ranks, with the Left General typically overseeing defensive or auxiliary troops, and the Right General overseeing offensive or punitive campaigns.*

**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao/Way is Ever Nameless**
This chapter in the *Tongxuan Jing* states:
*"In the ancient times, those who practiced the Dao/Way and virtue/power
Were aided by Heaven, assisted by Earth, and helped by spirits.
The Four Barbarians* submitted to them,
Auspicious stars appeared, and benevolent clouds spread.
Yellow dragons descended, sweet dew fell,
Nectar springs flowed, and fine grains ripened.
Mushrooms sprouted, and twin branches grew.
Phoenixes gathered in their courts,
Qilins roamed their outskirts,
Qiaolongs dwelled in their marshes.
The seas did not surge, the rivers did not overflow.
The sun and moon, stars and constellations moved without deviation,
Winds and rains followed their seasons,
And the Five Grains flourished in abundance.
These are the ten divine responses and auspicious omens of the ancients who walked the Dao/Way."*

The *Tongxuan Jing* [□ *Dào Yuán Piān*] says:
*"The ancient Dao/Way was nameless—
Namelessness is speechlessness.
Speechlessness is the origin of action.
The origin of action was the first knotting of cords*—
Though crude, it was sufficient.
The *Tongxuan Jing* states:
*The ancients’ Dao/Way sought smallness in the heart,
And greatness in aspiration.
Smallness in the heart meant restraining petty desires;
Greatness in aspiration meant nothing was beyond governance.
What they held was very small,
Yet what they entrusted was very great—
Thus, the Dao/Way’s method of governance, though simple, was enough to rule the world.
All under Heaven dared not defy them."*

The *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
*"In the ancient age of the Great Dao/Way and supreme virtue/power, all things moved in simplicity yet harmonized without being coerced; their naturalness was preserved, and the people’s innate nature governed itself.
If sovereigns and kings could uphold this, the *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
*'The ancients’ sovereigns and kings took non-action as their constant practice.
All things would naturally submit to them.*
The *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
*'By non-action, nothing remained undone; all things transformed spontaneously.
Heaven and Earth combined in harmony, and sweet dew descended.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'When yin and yang were in concord, sweet rain fell in due season.
The people required no command yet all was balanced.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'The silent command—this was how the ancient sages became teachers.
Though they spoke no words, all under Heaven transformed.
Only when names were first established,*
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'Later ages, with partial attainment and named methods, had speech.
Speech marked the completion of affairs.
The completion of affairs was the creation of books and learning tools.
Once names were set,*
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'Now, the Dao/Way of later people seeks comprehensive wisdom yet rigid practice, abundant capability yet few deeds. Comprehensive wisdom means none were left unknowing; rigid practice means some things were not done; abundant capability means none were left ungoverned; few deeds mean restraint in what was held.
Yet what they saw as great was small in knowledge and unaware of loss—
Thus, the Dao/Way’s method of governance, though grand, was enough to bring chaos.
They would also know when to stop,*
The *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
*'Know when to stop?
What they did not know was the utmost.
Knowing when to stop was the way to avoid peril.
The *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
*'No one can mirror themselves in flowing water,
Yet they are reflected in still water—
Only the still can still all things.
Compare the Dao/Way’s presence in the world,*
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'Thus, the Dao/Way’s presence in the world is like the great rivers and seas that do nothing yet take all streams.
Like valleys and basins in relation to rivers and seas.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*'The great rivers and seas do nothing,
Yet they receive the hundred streams—
They do not seek yet are able to obtain.'*

**Chapter 33: Knowing Others is Wisdom**

This chapter from the *Nánhuá Jīng* states:
In ancient times, the sages tempered their ambitions.
Wealth, honor, prestige, fame, and profit—these six things inflame ambition.
If the heart remains undisturbed, it is upright.
Uprightness brings emptiness, tranquility, and non-action—yet nothing remains undone.
Thus, the ancient sages possessed wisdom in knowing others and clarity in self-awareness,
strength to excel over others and resolve to overcome oneself,
wealth in contentment and resolve in steadfast action.
With these six virtues,
in life, their deeds were enduring and their path unerring;
in death, their names were immortal and their legacy eternal.
Hence, these are called the *Six Virtues of Longevity*—
wisdom in knowing others is called wisdom.

Knowing others is wisdom.
As the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:
To recognize the worthy is wisdom,
and no wisdom surpasses knowing others.
Knowing others prevents chaotic governance.

Self-awareness is clarity.
As the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:
To cherish the worthy is benevolence,
to revere the worthy is propriety.

To excel over others is to have strength,
as the *Tóngxuān Jīng* [missing text] *De* Chapter says:
Those who excel over others possess strength,
and those who can wield others’ strength must first win their hearts.
Those who win hearts also secure themselves.

To overcome oneself is to be strong,
as the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:
Self-mastery is strength,
and those who are strong must wield others’ strength.
There has never been one who gained themselves while losing others,
nor one who lost themselves while gaining others.

Contentment is wealth,
as the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:
The root of sufficiency lies in frugality—
without hoarding wealth, one is rich.

Steadfast action is resolve,
as the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:
In ancient times, they did not deem lowliness perilous,
nor poverty shameful,
nor criticism unjust.
Those who never stray from their path endure long.

To die without fading is longevity,
as the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:
Though the noble perish, their names do not vanish.
Their fame transmitted to posterity—
where could such be called not long-lived?

**Chapter 34: The Great Dao Flows**

This chapter from the *Nánhuá Jīng* states:
Nothing is more divine than Heaven,
nothing richer than Earth,
nothing greater than the sovereign.
Thus, the sovereign’s virtue aligns with Heaven’s grandeur and Earth’s abundance—
this is how the ancient sages rode upon Heaven and Earth’s riches,
nurturing all things and guiding humanity with the Dao of love and care.
The *Classic* does not claim greatness itself,
yet all things return to it,
and thus it accomplishes the greatness of the world—
following the Dao to nourish the people.

The Great Dao flows,
as the *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
Observing the Dao broadly, all things respond in fullness.
To love all things universally is to recognize Heaven and Earth as one.
It can be wielded at will,
as the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:
The Great Dao knows no impossibility.
It abides in principle—
when seen as possible, do not rush;
when seen as impossible, do not abandon.
Possible and impossible are like left and right,
like exterior and interior.
All things depend upon it,
as the *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
The Dao nourishes all things without transgression,
its blessings extend to ten thousand generations without being called benevolent.
It gives life without complaint,
as the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:
The Dao—all things rely upon it for life,
yet none know its virtue.
Its deeds accomplished, it claims no ownership,
as the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:
The Great Constant Dao gives life without possession,
its virtue unknown.
It nurtures all things without lordship,
as the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:
The Great Constant Dao stores and accumulates without growing rich,
gives and receives without impoverishing others,
nurtures all things without claiming mastery.
Ever without desire, it may be called small;
to have all things return without lordship is great,
as the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:
The Great Constant Dao transforms without domination.
The *Dònglíng Jīng* says:
The Dao is neither a treasury of schemes nor an office of affairs;
its work is most subtle, yet it claims no achievement.
Thus, the sage
as the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:
Thus, the sage broadly loves through the Dao,
loving below and thereby accomplishing the great.
Yet it never claims greatness,
as the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:
Ancient wise rulers modeled themselves after rivers and seas.
Rivers and seas love what is below,
yet never claim greatness—
all streams return to them, and thus they accomplish greatness.
Thus, they accomplish greatness.
As the *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
Through this, the Dao bestows a grand vision upon the world.

**Chapter 35: Grasping the Great Symbol**

This chapter from the *Nánhuá Jīng* states:
In the age of Shénnóng of old,
resting, they lay in ease;
arising, they moved with grace.
The people knew their mothers but not their fathers,
living alongside deer and elk,
plowing for food and weaving for clothing,
without hearts of harm or contention—
this was the age of the Great Dao,
the peak of virtue.
To grasp the Dao is to attain tranquility,
and thus the world is at perfect peace.

To grasp the Great Symbol,
as the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:
Those who grasp the Dao are complete in virtue.
Virtue complete is the sage’s Dao.
In ancient times, the Three Sovereigns established the Dao’s succession at the center,
acting without action yet in harmony with the Dao,
speaking without words yet in accord with virtue.
All under Heaven turned toward them.
Turning without harm,
as the *Tóngxuān Jīng* says:
In ancient times, calamities did not arise,
disasters did not occur,
and the world was in peace—
this was the foundation of governance.
Peace, stability, and harmony,
as the *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
In ancient times, clever schemes were unused,
all returned to Heaven—
this is called perfect peace, the foundation of governance.
Delight and bait,
as the *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
They found their food sweet,
their customs joyful.

「过客止。 [*Nánhuá Jīng*] says: Let them dwell in peace.
*Tóngxuān Jīng* says: In ancient times, the sage’s governance of the people was such—
they allowed each to follow their nature,
to dwell in their homes without interference.
The Dao’s expression in words,
*Tóngxuān Jīng* says: The Dao cannot be articulated in speech,
for speech that is not the Dao is false.
In ancient times, the Dao was practiced without words.
It was subtle, without savor.

*Tóngxuān Jīng* says: The Dao is subtle, without desire,
indifferent, without action.
Subtle, it lacks savor;
without contemplation, yet attained.

It cannot be seen by mere sight,
*Tóngxuān Jīng* says: The Dao cannot be clearly perceived,
for perception that is not true is false.
Those who strain their eyes to see clearly
weary their minds yet fail to grasp it.
If one waits for the eyes to discern,
then governance becomes arduous.
Knowing through sight is called losing the Dao;
in ancient times, one saw without straining.

It cannot be heard by mere listening,
*Tóngxuān Jīng* says: The Dao cannot be fleetly heard,
for hearing that is not true is false.
If one uses their ears to govern,
their minds labor in vain.
If one waits for the ears to hear clearly,
then governance becomes arduous.
Knowing through hearing is called losing the Dao;
in ancient times, one heard without straining.

Its use cannot be exhausted.
*Tóngxuān Jīng* records: Wénzǐ asked: How does the sovereign gain the people’s joy?
Lǎozǐ replied: Like the rivers and seas.
Subtle, without savor,
its use cannot be exhausted,
first small, then great.

In the chapter *Jiāngyù Qìzhī* (第三十六), this passage from *Nánhuá Zhēnjīng* (《南华真经□胠筐篇》) states:
The virtuous cannot stand without the sage’s Dao;
thieves cannot act without the sage’s wisdom.
When virtuous people are few and the unvirtuous many,
then the sage’s wisdom benefits the world little
while harming it greatly.
Rú’s wine was thin yet Hán Dān was besieged;
the sage arises yet great thieves multiply.
Thus, the sage’s wisdom—
though it restrains violence with laws and seals,
and though thieves may be granted their measures and weights,
their jewels and pearls—
the world will not be governed.
Hence it is said:
Fish cannot be removed from the deep;
the world’s useful tools,
should not be displayed to the people.
Tools for measure and weight
produce theft and deceit.

If one would weaken them,
one must first strengthen them;
*Nánhuá Jīng* says: In later ages, though sages valued wisdom to govern the world,
they were in fact valuing tools for theft and deceit.
If one makes measures and weights to weigh with,
then both the people and the weights will be stolen.
If one would weaken them,
one must first strengthen them;
*Nánhuá Jīng* says: In later ages, when sages arose and great thieves multiplied,
if one makes scales and balances to measure with,
then both the people and the scales will be stolen.
If one would abolish them,
one must first establish them;
*Nánhuá Jīng* says: In ancient times, when sages died and their wisdom perished,
great thieves did not arise,
and the world was peaceful without strife.
In later ages, if one makes seals and tokens to trust in,
then both the people and the seals will be stolen.
If one would take them away,
one must first give them.
*Nánhuá Jīng* says: In later ages, if sages’ wisdom did not perish,
great thieves would not cease;
if one uses virtue and righteousness to correct it,
then both the people and virtue will be stolen.
This is called subtle clarity.

*Nánhuá Jīng* (《南华真经□微明篇》) says: The Dao can be yin, can be yang,
can be hidden, can be manifest.
Bound yet expansive, hidden yet clear—
it contains yin and releases yang,
illuminating the three luminaries.
First revering the subtle and minute,
then attaining great clarity.
Softness overcomes strength.

*Tóngxuān Jīng* says: The Dao can be weak, can be strong,
can be yielding, can be firm.
Yielding yet firm, weak yet strong—
it begins in yielding and weakness,
achieves in strength and firmness,
accumulating yielding to become firm,
accumulating weakness to become strong.

Fish cannot be removed from the deep,
*Nánhuá Jīng* says: The beasts of a cage carapace,
if they leave the mountains, will not escape the nets;
the fish that can swallow boats, if they lose their water,
will be tormented by ants.
Thus, birds and beasts do not tire of heights,
fish and turtles do not tire of depths.
If the spring dries up,
fish will gather on land,
moistening each other with breath,
nourishing each other with spittle,
yet unable to save the drought—
it is better to forget each other in rivers and lakes.

Fish create their own conditions in water;
those who create their own conditions in water
dig ponds to raise and provide for them,
thus it is said: Fish cannot be removed from the deep.

The world’s useful tools,
*Nánhuá Jīng* says: Sages of later ages are the world’s useful tools,
not meant to reveal the world’s wisdom—
for wisdom itself generates theft and deceit.
If thieves steal virtue and righteousness,
along with measures, weights, seals, and tokens,
even with the rewards of carriages and fine robes they cannot be persuaded,
nor with the threats of axes and halberds be deterred.
This is valuing tools for theft
and making them ungovernable—
the fault of later sages’ teachings to the people.
The sage does not weary of simplicity;
it is better to forget each other in Dao and skill.

People create their own conditions in the Dao;
those who create their own conditions in the Dao
live without strife, attaining steadfastness,
thus it is said: The world’s useful tools,
should not be displayed to the people.
Should not be displayed to the people.
*Nánhuá Jīng* says: Abolish the sage, discard wisdom,
and great thieves will cease;
discard jade, shatter pearls,
and petty thieves will not rise;
burn the seals, break the tokens,
and the people will be simple and unrefined;
abolish the measures, discard the weights,
and the people will not contend.
Should not be displayed to the people.»

**Chapter Thirty-Seventh: The Dao Ever Does Nothing**

This chapter of the *Nánhuá Jīng* speaks:
The One Dao does nothing—
it covers and nourishes all things,
vast and boundless, so great!
Thus, the virtuous person cannot but carve the heart to do nothing in the Dao.

To do nothing while doing is called great;
to do nothing while speaking is called virtue.
Great virtue—this is all.

In ancient times, through doing nothing, transformation occurred naturally,
and the world was in great harmony.

The Dao ever does nothing.
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
Doing nothing is the constant of the Dao,
yet nothing is left undone.

The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
The Great Dao does nothing,
yet all things arise naturally and nothing is left undone.

If lords and kings could guard it,
the *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
The virtuous person, governing the world,
does nothing—this is best.
Do nothing,
and thus the nature of life and destiny finds peace.
All things will transform naturally.

The *Nánhuá Jīng* recounts: Hongmeng said to Yunshang:
"You dwell in doing nothing,
and all things transform of themselves.
When transformation stirs to action,
the *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
When the people desire to act and move,
it is because the orders are inconsistent.
The heart is not sincere in the Dao,
orders are labored upon by those above,
yet do not respond from below.
I shall govern them with the nameless simplicity.

The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
Ancient sages governed with the Dao,
doing nothing above,
and the people transformed as if by divine will.
The nameless simplicity—
it too shall not desire.

The *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
All things have distinct principles,
the Dao does not favor any;
thus it is nameless.
Nameless, hence it does nothing.

Above does nothing,
below also does nothing.
To not desire is to be still.

The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
Ancient wise rulers did nothing—
doing nothing is guarding stillness,
guarding stillness can make one sovereign over the world.
The world will naturally align itself.

The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
When the ruler returns to purity and stillness,
all things will naturally align.

**Chapter Thirty-Eighth: The Supreme Virtue Does Not Virtue**

This chapter of the *Nánhuá Jīng* [□ *Zhìběi Yóu* Section] speaks:
In the highest antiquity, the sages practiced the teaching of no-speech,
and through doing nothing, the world was governed.
Thus, the Way of the Three Sovereigns cannot be attained,
the virtue of the Five Emperors cannot be reached,
the benevolence of the Three Kings can be emulated,
the righteousness of Shang and Zhou can be diminished,
the rituals of the Five Hegemons were mere pretense,
and the wars of the Seven States brought only chaos.

Thus it is said:
Lose the Dao, then virtue arises;
lose virtue, then benevolence arises;
lose benevolence, then righteousness arises;
lose righteousness, then ritual arises;
lose ritual, then war arises.

Ritual is the superficial aspect of the Five Constants,
the ornament of the Dao,
the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust—
and the beginning of chaos.

The supreme virtue does not virtue,
and thus virtue exists.

The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* [□ *Upper Virtue* Section] says:
Nothing is higher than Heaven,
the Dao of Heaven is supreme and does nothing—
the sage follows it,
and the world is settled.

The Dao of Heaven is supreme virtue.
Supreme virtue does not virtue,
and thus virtue exists.

Inferior virtue does not lose virtue,
and thus virtue does not exist.

The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
Nothing is lower than Earth,
human affairs are active and lowly—
the virtuous person embodies this,
and the world falls into disorder.

Human affairs are inferior virtue.
Inferior virtue does not lose virtue,
and thus virtue does not exist.

Supreme virtue does nothing yet does nothing,
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* [□ *Upper Benevolence* Section] says:
In ancient times, the Three Sovereigns of supreme virtue did nothing,
and the world turned to them.

Inferior virtue acts yet does nothing,
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
In later times, the Five Emperors of inferior virtue acted,
and the Four Seas turned to them.

Supreme benevolence acts yet does nothing,
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
The Three Sovereigns of supreme benevolence,
and the world within the seas turned to them.

Supreme righteousness acts and does nothing,
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
The Shang and Zhou of supreme righteousness,
and one kingdom turned to them.

Supreme ritual acts, yet none respond,
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
The Five Hegemons of supreme ritual,
and one village turned to them.
Then they rolled up their sleeves and forced compliance,
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
The Seven States, lacking these five virtues—morality, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, ritual—
the people did not turn to them.
When they were not turned to, they used force,
and the world fell into great chaos.

Thus, lose the Dao, then virtue arises,
The *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
The Five Emperors lost the Dao and then used virtue,
but virtue could not be reached.

Lose virtue, then benevolence arises,
The *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
The Three Kings lost virtue and then used benevolence,
but benevolence could be emulated.

Lose benevolence, then righteousness arises,
The *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
Shang and Zhou lost benevolence and then used righteousness,
but righteousness could be diminished.

Lose righteousness, then ritual arises.
The *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
The Five Hegemons lost righteousness and then used ritual,
but ritual was mere pretense.

Ritual—
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
In the final age, those who practice ritual
call shallow conduct "benevolence and righteousness,"
call thin conduct "ritual and wisdom,"
and shallow conduct brings little blessing.

Ritual is the ornament of substance.
The *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
The sage practices the teaching of no-speech;
the Dao cannot be attained,
virtue cannot be reached,
benevolence can be emulated,
righteousness can be diminished,
ritual is mere pretense.

Ritual is the ornament of the Dao,
the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,
and the beginning of chaos.

The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
In the final age, practicing benevolence and righteousness
can rectify one kingdom,
practicing ritual and music
can rectify one village—
the virtue is thin, and the blessings are small.

The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
The Five Hegemons used ritual as a weapon,
and became the origin of chaos.

The *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
Ritual—
it is the beginning of chaos.

Foreknowledge—
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
Ancient practitioners of the Dao
called deep practice "morality and virtue,"
shallow practice "thick blessings,"
and complete practice "the world submits."

The ornament of the Dao—
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
Ancient practitioners of morality and virtue
rectified the world—
thick virtue brings great blessings—
and the beginning of folly.

The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
The Five Sovereigns first relied on virtue and the Dao for their renown,
though ancient times were simple, their virtue remained abundant.

The *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
In the age of supreme virtue,
their actions were measured and deliberate,
their enlightenment effortless and natural.
Thus, the true gentleman—

The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
Thus, the true gentleman remains serene without thought,
unconcerned without care,
walks where no path exists,
wanders without weariness,
exits without gates,
enters without walls,
harnessing his spirit,
laying aside his perceptions—
so that within he cultivates his essence,
not adorning its external trappings,
virtue and the Dao require no action.

He dwells in substance, not in ornament.
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng [□ Upper Benevolence Section]*—Wénzǐ asked the Master:
How do benevolence, righteousness, and ritual cause chaos?
Because they are thin compared to the Dao’s virtue.

The Master said:
To act in benevolence is to govern through human sorrow and joy,
to act in righteousness is to take and give based on human affairs.
Yet sorrow and joy cannot spread universally,
and exhausting the treasury’s wealth cannot suffice for the extravagance of all people.
Thus, knowing is inferior to practicing the Dao and embodying virtue,
aligning with the natural order of Heaven and Earth—
all things will then self-regulate,
and the world will be sustained.
Benevolence and righteousness cling to human sentiment,
so they are thin—
hence the true gentleman dwells in substance, not in ornament.

He abides in truth, not in its trappings.
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng*—Wénzǐ asked the Master:
Why do later ages use benevolence, righteousness, and ritual to justify war and punishment?
Because they are thin compared to the Dao’s virtue.

The Master said:
Ancient times followed nature’s course, calling it the Dao,
and realized its inherent nature, calling it virtue.
When virtue and the Dao were pure and profound,
war and punishment were unnecessary.
In later ages, virtue and nature were lost,
so benevolence and righteousness were employed—
but when these were shallow and insubstantial,
war and punishment were resorted to.
Thus, the true gentleman abides in truth, not in its trappings.
Hence, he discards the latter and embraces the former.
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
Hence, he discards the latter and embraces the former,
and Heaven’s calamities do not arise.
He who gains this forgets the other,
and thus misfortune departs, blessings come.

The chapter *"Obtaining the One"* (39th):
This chapter of the *Tōng Xuān Jīng* speaks:
In the most ancient age, the sage cultivated virtue beyond praise,
not seeking others’ praise,
but what he used to win the world—
it was not about occupying power or bearing noble titles,
but about mastering the heart’s governance over the world,
and harnessing its natural force.
Later ages had the name "ruler," yet lacked even one man’s praise,
and thus lost the world.
Jié and Zhòu did not rule as kings,
Shāng and Wǔ did not act as rebels.
In ancient times, the sage received countless praises of the world,
yet it did not make him better—
true praise is no praise,
and he grasped the essence of the Dao.
Without praise, he embodied Heaven’s will,
and thus the world endured long.

The chapter *"Obtaining the One"*:
The *Chōng Xū Jīng* says:
The Dao has no form or boundary,
one *qi* transforms into nine variations,
which then return to one.
This One—
the origin of all transformations in Heaven, Earth, and beings.
Heaven obtains the One to remain clear.
The *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
Heaven acts without doing, and thus remains clear.

Earth obtains the One to remain tranquil.
The *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
Earth acts without doing, and thus remains tranquil.

The spirit obtains the One to become responsive.
The *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
He who is serene, unadorned, still, and without action—
this is the way to nourish the spirit,
so that worries cannot intrude,
and malevolent *qi* cannot assail,
and longevity is attained.
Once, Guāngchéngzǐ attained this from the Dao,
and lived a thousand two hundred years without aging.

The valley obtains the One to remain full.
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
A hundred rivers flow together,
yet if they do not empty into the sea, they are not valleys.
The source of rivers and seas is deep,
flowing without ceasing.
All things obtain the One to flourish.
The *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
All things cannot but thrive—
is this not their Dao?

Rulers obtain the One to govern the world.
The *Dònglíng Jīng* says:
Ancient rulers did not prize their ceremonies,
nor did they seek praise—
these were truly discerning.
Their governance—

The *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
When governance is unified, it is not divided.
Heaven, without remaining clear, would fear fragmentation.
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
When Heaven’s *qi* is divided, it forms a rainbow,
and the sun cannot endure.
Winter and summer alternate,
moons forget their days,
suns forget their nights.

Earth, without remaining tranquil, would fear upheaval.
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
When Earth’s *qi* is divided, it leaks and conceals,
and the moon cannot endure.

The spirit, without remaining responsive, would fear exhaustion.
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
When a man’s *qi* is divided, he falls ill—
his body labors without rest, and thus exhausts,
his spirit is used without cessation, and thus perishes.
The spirit is harmed by the afflictions of joy, anger, and overthinking—
when the spirit is spent, the body dies.
The *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
When the body labors without rest, it becomes worn,
when the spirit is used without cessation, it becomes strained—
strain leads to depletion,
and depletion leads to extinction.

The valley, without remaining full, would fear drying up.
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
Ditches and ponds overflow in floods,
and wither in drought—
when rivers dry, valleys become empty,
and hills level while depths are sealed.

All things, without flourishing, would fear annihilation.
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
When things thrive, they bear flowers and fruit—
when things die, they wither and decay.

Rulers, without attaining true elevation, would fear decline.
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
Those in high station must not be arrogant—
elevated yet not precarious,
full yet not overflowing—
this is how one endures wealth and honor.
If precarious, elevated, full, yet overflowing,
they cannot endure long.

Thus, elevation is rooted in humility,
and height is founded on lowliness.
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng [□ Talisman of Speech Section]* says:
Man has three grievances—
do you know them?
The high in rank are envied by others,
the great in office are hated by their lords,
the rich in wealth are resented by the people.
The higher the rank, the lower the ambition,
the greater the office, the smaller the heart,
the richer the wealth, the broader the giving—
if one cultivates these three, grievances will not arise.
Thus, elevation is rooted in humility,
and height is founded on lowliness.

Hence, rulers call themselves *"gū guǎ"* (lonely and solitary), *"bù gǔ"* (not full).

The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* [□ *Dao Yuan* Section] says:
The Sage calls himself *"gū guǎ"* (lonely and solitary), *"bù gǔ"* (not full), returning to his original root.
Is this not because he takes lowliness as his foundation?
Is it not so?

The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
When the will is weak yet deeds are strong,
he entrusts smallness to encompass greatness.
The Sage follows the Dao’s principle of *subtraction*,
thus humbling himself.

Subtraction brings greatness—
the world endures long.
This is the completion of the Dao’s movement.

Thus, though praised by many, he is without praise.
The *Nán Huá Jīng* [South Flower Sutra] says:
In ancient times, the Sage encompassed heaven and earth,
his virtue extending to all under heaven,
yet he did not know who he was.
Thus, in life he held no rank,
in death no posthumous name,
his substance did not accumulate,
his name did not stand.
This is called the Great Person.

Though the world praises him, it does not add to his virtue or vice—
how could one recognize his true worth?
Thus, praise becomes no praise at all.

He does not wish to be polished like jade,
nor dull like stone.

The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* [□ *Fú Yán* Section] says:
In ancient times, there were no named officials,
no scheming ministers,
no taskmasters,
no masterminds.
They hid in formlessness,
moved without weariness,
did not seek to precede in fortune,
did not initiate misfortune.
They began in namelessness,
acted when compelled.

If one desires fortune to precede, let him not see it;
if one desires profit, let him distance harm.
Thus, those who act without action and find peace—
if they lose their peace, they face peril;
those who govern without action—
if they lose their governance, they face chaos.

Thus, he does not wish to be polished like jade,
nor dull like stone.

**Reflection—The Dao’s Movement, Chapter Forty**
This chapter of the *Nán Huá Jīng* speaks:
Extreme yin is solemn and still,
extreme yang is radiant and fierce.
Solemn stillness arises from heaven,
radiant fierceness issues from earth.
These two—yin and yang—interact harmoniously,
and all things are born from them.

Some mark their course yet their form is unseen,
ebbing and flowing, full and empty,
darkening and brightening daily,
changing monthly,
ever acting yet unseen in their deeds.
Life sprouts from its origin,
death returns to its end.
Beginning and end oppose the boundless,
yet their limits are unknown.

The cold and heat of heaven and earth—
these are the Dao’s yin and yang in motion,
the generation and transformation of all things.

**Reflection—The Dao’s Movement**
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
When yin-qi prevails, it transforms into yang—
this is the Dao’s movement of reversal.

The weak—this is the Dao’s application.
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
When yang-qi prevails, it transforms into yin—
the weak is the Dao’s application.

All things under heaven—
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
The Dao of heaven and earth:
having and not-having generate each other—
this is the transformation of all things.
The *Chōng Xū Jīng* says:
All things generate and transform,
entering and exiting the mechanism of change,
constantly generating, constantly transforming.

They generate from what exists—
The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
All things move and align with yang’s waves—
this is generation.
The *Chōng Xū Jīng* says:
All things that generate
emerge from the mechanism and constantly generate.
All things that generate cannot but generate.

Their end—this is the necessary conclusion of generation.
They generate from non-existence.

The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
All things stilled align with yin’s virtue—
this is transformation.
The *Chōng Xū Jīng* says:
All things that transform
enter the mechanism and constantly transform.
All things that transform cannot but transform.
Generation is the necessary end of transformation.

The Noble Hear the Dao, Chapter Forty-One

This chapter of the *Nán Huá Jīng* states:
In ancient times, when evil was hidden and distinctions of right and wrong arose,
it was all due to the teachings of the Zhou.
When hidden in the *Wén Huá* (cultural refinements),
the distinctions of Confucianism and Mohism emerged—
the prominence of Confucian and Mohist distinctions
is how the Dao was diminished.

In the Zhou era, many scholars of Confucianism and Mohism flourished,
all relying on their artificial methods and doctrines,
disturbing the world with their teachings—
this could not be remedied.

The so-called Dao-teachings of antiquity,
did they truly hide within Confucianism and the various schools?

There are those who carve their intentions and follow rigid conduct,
departing from the world and its customs,
uttering lofty theories and grievances—
this is mere arrogance.
These are the mountain-valley scholars,
not the world’s withered ones who rush toward the abyss,
the kind favored by Yíqí and Qūyuán.

There are those who speak of benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, trustworthiness,
respectfulness, frugality, and yielding—
this is mere cultivation.
These are the scholars of the common world,
teachers who dwell in ease and study,
the kind favored by Kǒngzǐ and Mèngzǐ.

There are those who speak of great achievements,
establishing great names,
ordering ruler and subject,
rectifying high and low—
this is mere governance.
These are the court scholars,
those who honor the sovereign and strengthen the state,
pursuing combined merit and power,
the kind favored by Yīyīn and Zhōugōng.

There are those who dwell in marshes and wilds,
reside in seclusion and leisure,
fish and drift without purpose—
this is mere inaction.
These are the river-sea scholars,
those who avoid the world and seek repose,
the kind favored by Cháo Fù and Xǔ Yóu.

But the ancient noble ones—
without rigid conduct yet lofty,
without benevolence and righteousness yet cultivated,
without fame and merit yet governing,
without rivers and seas yet at ease—
without forgetting anything,
their hearts are clear and still;
without lacking anything,
the Dao is effortless.
In their simplicity, without bounds,
all beauties follow them—
this is the effortless Dao of heaven and earth,
the still virtue of the Sage,
the great governance of the world.

The Noble Hear the Dao,
and diligently practice it.

The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
In the upper antiquity, they followed heaven’s effortless Dao—
following heaven is the Dao of governing heaven and earth,
stillness and effortlessness are called the Dao of heaven.

The Middle Hear the Dao,
and hold it as if it were both present and lost.

The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
In the middle antiquity, they valued the worthy and shaped teachings—
valuing the worthy is the origin of doubt and confusion.
In the middle antiquity, they upheld virtue but did not cherish the Dao,
the Dao faded while virtue flourished.

The Lowly Hear the Dao,
and laugh at it.

The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* says:
In the lower antiquity, they relied on ministers and learned skills—
relying on ministers is the Dao of peril and ruin.
In the lower antiquity, they anxiously clung to their teachings,
fearing they might lose them.

The *Nán Huá Jīng* (in the [Autumn Water] chapter) states:
North Sea If said to River Master:
“Bìyī declined it for the sake of reputation,
and Zhòngnǐ spoke of it for the sake of knowledge—
they both boast of their learning,
laughing at the Dao’s effortlessness,
not unlike how you, River Master, boast of your waters,
laughing at the North Sea’s paucity!”

The frog of a well cannot be spoken to of the sea,
for it is confined to the mud of the well.
The summer insect cannot be spoken to of ice,
for it is bound to the warmth of summer.
The rigid scholar cannot be spoken to of the Dao,
for he is enslaved by the teachings of learning.

Now you have emerged from the banks of the Jīng River,
gazing upon the great sea,
yet you know your own insignificance—
how then can you speak of the great principles?

The waters of the world are none greater than the sea—
all streams flow into it,
yet it does not know when to stop and overflows not;
its ebb drains it,
yet it does not know when to cease and empties not.
Spring and autumn remain unchanged,
and it knows not drought or flood.
Its currents surpass the rivers and seas—
this cannot be measured.

Yet I have never boasted of this,
for I compare my form to heaven and earth,
and receive my *qi* from yin and yang.
I exist between heaven and earth,
like a small stone or small tree in a great mountain.
While my existence is visible,
my understanding is limited—
how dare I boast?

Considering the vastness of the four seas within heaven and earth,
it is not like stacked emptiness in the great marshes—
how could it be vast?
Considering the multitude of China within the sea,
it is not like scattered grains in the great granary—
how could it be many?
Considering the abundance of people and things in the nine regions,
it is not like hairs and fur on a horse’s body—
how could it be abundant?

The five Emperors’ dominions,
the three Kings’ struggles,
the benevolent’s worries,
the capable’s labors—
all are bounded by greatness and smallness.

Seeking the utmost greatness with their utmost smallness,
they are thus confused and cannot find themselves.
From this perspective,
how can they know that heaven and earth suffice to exhaust the utmost greatness?
The one who views greatness from the small
becomes lost in himself—
not laughing is not enough to be the Dao.

The *Nán Huá Jīng* recounts how the debater Gōngsūn Lóng questioned Prince Móu of Wèi:
“I was young when I learned my Master’s Dao,
and grew long in understanding the practice of benevolence and righteousness.
I harmonize what is same,
separate what is different,
and exhaust the arguments of all mouths—
thus I laugh at Zhūangzǐ’s words,
which seem vague and contradictory.”

Prince Móu reclined, sighed deeply,
and laughed toward heaven:
“Have you not heard of the frog of a well?
To the turtle of the Eastern Sea, I say:
‘I delight in the great and boundless—
why does my Master not come to observe it?’

Before the Eastern Sea turtle’s left foot had entered,
its right knee was already bound—
thus it hesitated and withdrew,
telling the frog of its sea:
‘A distance of a thousand *lǐ*,
is not enough to display its greatness;
a height of a thousand *rèn*,
is not enough to exhaust its depth.’

The frog of the well, hearing this,
was startled and lost in confusion.

Observing Zhūangzǐ’s most wondrous words,
you are content with a moment’s gain—
are you not the frog of the well?

You now seek it with careful scrutiny,
and probe it with argumentative skill—
this is truly like using a tube to view heaven,
or a needle to point at earth—
is it not small?

#2 Away you go!

Gōngsūn Lóng’s mouth gaped but could not close,
his tongue rose but could not descend—
thus he faltered and fled.

Zhì Zhī spoke thus:

*"The* South Flower Sutra *records: Zhī Zhī said to Confucius: ‘I have heard that in antiquity, men tilled to eat and wove to clothe, with no hearts of mutual harm or slaughter—this was the height of virtue’s flourishing, the world at great peace. Yet the Yellow Emperor could not attain this virtue, and fought with Xiōng Yóu at Zhúlù’s wilds, staining the earth a hundred *lǐ* with blood. The Tang and Yú ruled, established ministers, the Shāng king was overthrown, the Wǔ king slew Jié. From then on, the strong oppressed the weak, the many tyrannized the few. The kings of Shāng and Zhōu onward were but agents of chaos—how could they be worthy of veneration?

Now you, refining the ways of the martial and the literary, wielding the world’s arguments to teach posterity—your robes are patched, your sash frayed, your conduct thin and insincere. You have lost the ancient simplicity, and the world is in disarray.

**Clarity of the Way seems obscured.**
*The* South Flower Sutra *says: The ancient worthies aligned their inner selves with the Dao, doing good without contrivance, and took Heaven as their companion. The worthies of today, though outwardly conforming to rites and respectful in action, take humanity as their companion.

**Advancing the Way seems like retreat.**
*The* South Flower Sutra *says: The ancient worthies cultivated non-action within, yet did not contrive without. The worthies of today contrive without, yet do not cultivate non-action within.

**The Way’s rectitude seems crooked.**
*The* South Flower Sutra *says: The ancients transformed outwardly yet remained untransformed within—they guarded their inner purity without contriving for the outer world. The worthies of today are transformed within yet untransformed without—they guard the outer world with contrivance, yet neglect their inner selves.

**Great virtue seems like a valley.**
*The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: The ancient worthies savored the Dao without abandoning it. The worthies of today abandon the Dao without savoring it. To forsake the Way and rely on learning is perilous; to discard virtue and employ talent is to invite ruin.

**Pure white seems like shame.**
*The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: The worthies of high antiquity, though pure and unadorned, were called ‘great white’ as if shamed. They returned to simplicity, their essence unspoiled. The worthies of later ages, treating cleverness as governance, labor their minds yet fail to enlighten; those who rely on wit, though they strain their hearts, achieve nothing.

**Ample virtue seems insufficient.**
*The* South Flower Sutra *says: The worthies of high antiquity had virtue so vast it seemed lacking. *The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: The superior worthies had virtue so broad it seemed insufficient. Yet today’s worthies, though they master a single learning or refine a single skill, can only offer partial explanations—unfit to broadly apply to governance and teaching.

**Great sound is rare in voice.**
*The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: The worthies of high antiquity, whose Dao was most vast, had no sound or voice—they returned to simplicity at their end, and the people acted without guile. The worthies of later ages, though they excel in minor arts, break harmony; those skilled in trifles lose their naturalness. To debate a single phrase, to master a single technique—though one may speak eloquently, it is unfit to broadly apply to governance and teaching.

**Great form has no shape.**
*The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: The worthies of high antiquity, whose simplicity was most vast, had no fixed form. Their eyes, though clear, did not see; their ears, though still, did not hear. Their mouths, though closed, did not speak; their hearts, though at rest, did not scheme. They abandoned cleverness, returned to the uncarved block, preserved their spirit, discarded knowledge—neither liking nor disliking—this is called Great Harmony. The Dao is hidden, nameless.

*The* South Flower Sutra *says: To revere antiquity while belittling the present is the way of the shallow scholar. Yet if one views the present through the lens of the Jié Wéi lineage, who could avoid eccentric learning? Only the truly wise, with profound virtue and perfect humanity, can wander the world in the Dao without eccentricity, follow humanity with non-action without losing their true nature. They do not teach through cleverness, nor do they cling to learning—they receive meaning from the Dao, not from study.

*The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: To dwell in obscurity, speak in silence, govern with non-action, yet see deeds accomplished without knowing how—this is the Dao of the Sage.

For only the Dao—
*The* Mysterious Transformation Sutra *says: The ancient true worthies were those whose nature aligned with the Dao. They cultivated within yet did not contrive without, wandering the roots of Heaven and Earth. Unconcerned with the dust of the world, they roamed freely in the business of non-doing. Mechanical cleverness did not burden their minds; they knew without learning, saw without looking, achieved without action, spoke eloquently without effort—adrift in non-action. The world transformed of itself; this was the true worthies’ pure wandering in the uncarved Dao.

**Generosity in lending, yet completion is assured.**
*The* South Flower Sutra *records: Lǎo Dān said to Yáng Zǐ Jū: ‘The governance of the enlightened king covers the world yet seems not of his own doing. He transforms and lends to all things, yet the people do not rely on him. He has no ostentatious name, yet things take joy in him. He stands firm yet unobtrusive, wandering in the Dao—he is nonexistent.’"*

The ancient **true worthies** stood in the realm of **non-lending** (*bù dài*), adrift in non-action. **Non-lending** means no excess—nothing is thrust upon things. The *Chapter of the Dao’s Generation* (Fourth Twenty-Two) of the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (*Tōng Xuán Jīng*) states: The Dao’s generation begins with the **origin** (*yuán*) and **production** (*chǎn*), having no beginning. It begins with **softness and weakness** (*róuruò*), yet completes as **firmness and strength** (*gāngqiáng*). Those who seek **firmness** must guard it with **weakness**, accumulating weakness to achieve strength. Observing what they accumulate reveals the Dao of **preservation and decay** (*cúnwáng*).

In the **Great Ancient Age**, the **sage** (*shèngrén*) used the Dao to **settle** (*zhèn*) it and **reduce** (*sǔn*) the **rushing qi** (*chōngqì*), guarding softness without forcing strength. By **transforming** (*huà*) himself through **merit and renown** (*gōngmíng*), he thus achieved his kingship.

The *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Nine Guarding Chapters*) says: Before Heaven and Earth took form, they were **dim and indistinct**, **mysterious and unified** (*yǎoyǎo mínghún ér wéi yī*), **silent and lucid** (*jìrán chéngqīng*)—this was the Dao. The Dao generates **One** (*yī*), which is Heaven (*tiān*); **One** generates **Two** (*èr*), which is Earth (*dì*), **pure and refined** (*qīngwēi*) for Heaven, **dense and turbid** (*chóngzhuó*) for Earth. **Two** generates **Three** (*sān*), which is **Human** (*rén*), with **vital essence and qi** (*jīngqì*) as the human form. **Three** generates **ten thousand things** (*wànwù*), with **coarse qi** (*cūqì*) forming insects. **Firmness and softness** (*gāngróu xiāngchéng*) intermingle, and thus ten thousand things are born.

All things **carry yin** (*fù yīn*) and **embrace yang** (*bào yáng*), hence **wood fruits** (*mùshí*) grow from the **heart** (*xīn*), and **grass fruits** (*cǎoshí*) from the **flower** (*yīng*). The **rushing qi** (*chōngqì*) harmonizes into **balance** (*hé*). The *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Rushing qi** (*chōngqì*) harmonizes into **balance** (*hé*), and **balance** (*hé*) resides at the **center** (*zhōngyāng*), hence **embryonic and oviparous** (*tāiluǎn*) beings are born from the center. The *South Flower Sutra* says: All things generate from **form** (*xíng*). Those with **nine orifices** (*jiǔqiàng*) are born from the **embryo** (*tāi*), those with **eight orifices** (*bāqiàng*) from the **egg** (*luǎn*). The *Sutra of Penetrating Void* (*Chōng Xū Jīng*) says: **Rushing qi** (*chōngqì*) in **harmony** (*hé*) forms the human.

What people abhor, the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: The **petty man’s** (*xiǎorén*) emotional nature loves **strength** (*qiáng*) and abhors **weakness** (*ruò*), loves **firmness** (*gāng*) and abhors **softness** (*róu*), yet knows not the **loss** (*shī*). Only the **lonely, widowed, and childless** (*gūguǎ bùgǔ*), the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Chapter of the Dao’s Origin*) says: **Kings and nobles** (*wánggōng*) possess **merit and renown** (*gōngmíng*), while the lonely, widowed, and childless lack it. They guard **humility** (*qiān*) and **reduce** (*sǔn*), yet kings and nobles take this as their **standard** (*chēng*).

The *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: In ancient times, the **sage** (*shèngrén*) daily **reduced** (*sǔn*) his **rushing qi** (*chōngqì*), never daring to **be self-satisfied** (*zì mǎn*), daily advancing through **humility** (*qiān*). His **virtue and power** (*dé*) did not **decay** (*cuì*), for this was the **Way of Heaven** (*Tiāndào*). Thus, things may be **reduced** (*sǔn*) yet **benefit** (*yì*), or **benefit** (*yì*) yet **be reduced** (*sǔn*).

The *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Chapter of the Symbols*) says: Those with **little virtue yet much favor** (*dé shǎo ér chǒng duō*) are **mocked** (*jī*), those with **low talent yet high station** (*cái xià ér wèi gāo*) are **in peril** (*wēi*), and those with **no great merit yet thick rewards** (*hòu lù*) are **humiliated** (*wēi*). Thus, things may be **reduced** (*sǔn*) yet **benefit** (*yì*), or **benefit** (*yì*) yet **be reduced** (*sǔn*).

The *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **No greater blessing** (*fú*) than **no calamity** (*wú huò*), **no greater advantage** (*lì*) than **no loss** (*bù sǎng*). Thus, things may be **reduced** (*sǔn*) yet **benefit** (*yì*), or **benefit** (*yì*) yet **be reduced** (*sǔn*).

What people teach, the *South Flower Sutra* says: **Confucian scholars** (*rú*) **adjust** (*qū*) the **rites** (*lǐ*), teaching **respect** (*jìng*) and **humility** (*qiān*). I also teach this. The *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Softness and weakness** (*róuruò*) are the **companions of life** (*shēngzhī tú*). **Softness and weakness** (*róuruò*) are **supreme** (*shàng*). **Harshness and rigidity** (*qiángliáng*) cannot **attain their end** (*bù dé qí sǐ*), for in the **end times** (*mòshì*), those who **harbor harsh and rigid qi** (*bào qiángliáng zhī qì*) cannot endure long—**harshness and rigidity** (*qiángliáng*) lead to **death** (*sǐ*). I will take this as my **teacher** (*jiào fù*).

The *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Firmness and strength** (*gāngqiáng*) are the **companions of death** (*sǐ zhī tú*). **Firmness and strength** (*gāngqiáng*) are **inferior** (*xià*). The **Supreme Softness of the World** (Chapter Forty-Three) of the *South Flower Sutra* (□ *Chapter of the Way of Heaven*) states: **Vacuity, stillness, tranquility, and ease** (*xūjìng tiándàn*), **silent, empty, and non-acting** (*jìmò wúwéi*), **pure and uncarved** (*chúncuì sūpǔ*)—this is the **balance of Heaven and Earth** (*Tiāndì zhī píng*) and the **supreme Dao of virtue** (*Dàodé zhī zhì*), the **root of ten thousand things** (*wànwù zhī běn*).

To **illuminate** (*míng*) this **non-action** (*wúwéi*) while ruling as **sovereign** (*jūn*), **Emperor Yao** (*Táo Tāng*) was a **lord** (*wáng*). To **illuminate** (*míng*) this **non-action** (*wúwéi*) while serving as **subject** (*chén*), **Emperor Shun** (*Yú Shùn*) was a **minister** (*shì*). The **sage-king** (*shèngwáng*) **dwells** (*chǔ*) in this **non-action** (*wúwéi*) at the **ruling position** (*jūnshàng*), a **virtue of emperors and kings** (*Dìshǐng Tiānzǐ zhī dé*). **Lǎo Dān** stood in this **non-action** (*wúwéi*) as a **subject**, the **Dao of the Mysterious Sage** (*Xuánshèng sūwáng zhī dào*).

The **recluse** (*yìshì*) **retired** (*tuìjū*) in this **vacuity and stillness** (*xūjìng*), wandering freely in the **rivers and seas** (*Jiānghǎi*), and the **mountain and forest dwellers** (*shānlín zhī shì*) **submitted** (*fú*). The **scholar** (*shìrén*) **advanced** (*jìnwéi*) through this **tranquility and ease** (*tiándàn*), **nurturing the world** (*fǔshì*), and thus achieved **great merit and renown** (*gōng dà míng xiǎn*), with the world unified in **one** (*yī*).

**Stillness** (*jìng*) brings **sageliness** (*shèng*), **action** (*dòng*) brings **kingship** (*wáng*). **Non-action** (*wúwéi*) yet **is honored** (*zūn*), **simplicity and purity** (*pǔsū*) yet the world **cannot rival** (*mò néng yǔ zhī zhēng měi*)—thus the ancient sage said: *"I thereby know the benefit of non-action, the teaching of silence, the advantage of non-action—few in the world can attain it."* **Non-action** (*wúwéi*) is indeed beneficial.

The **Supreme Softness of the World**, the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: The **supreme softness** (*zhì róu*) of the world **gallops** (*chíchèng*) over the **supreme firmness** (*zhì jiān*) of the world. **Galloping** (*chíchèng*) over the **supreme firmness** (*zhì jiān*) of the world.

The *South Flower Sutra* says: **Water flows** (*shuǐ liú*) in **formlessness** (*wúxíng*), **emerging** (*fāxiè*) in the **Great Clarity** (*Tàiqīng*). The **overflowing** (*shuǐ zhī jū*) of water is **non-acting** (*wúwéi*) yet **its talent** (*cái*) is **naturally** (*zìrán*) displayed. **No gap** (*wújiàn*) enters **no gap** (*wújiàn*), the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **No gap** (*wújiàn*) enters **no gap** (*wújiàn*).

The *South Flower Sutra* says: **Heaven’s Gate** (*Tiānmén*) is **no gap** (*wújiàn*). All things **emerge** (*chū*) from **no gap** (*wújiàn*). **Gap** (*yǒu*) cannot **with Gap** (*yǒu*) be **Gap** (*yǒu*), **Gap** (*yǒu*) must **emerge** (*chū*) from **no gap** (*wújiàn*), yet **no gap** (*wújiàn*) has **gap** (*yǒu*). **Gap** (*yǒu*) emerges, **Gap** (*yǒu*) dies, **Gap** (*yǒu*) emerges, **Gap** (*yǒu*) enters. **Entering and emerging** (*rù chū*) yet **no form is seen** (*wú xiàn qí xíng*), this is called **Heaven’s Gate** (*Tiānmén*).

I thereby know, the *South Flower Sutra* says: **Lǎo Dān** stood in **non-action** (*wúwéi*) as a **subject** (*chén*), the **Dao of the Mysterious Sage** (*Xuánshèng sūwáng zhī dào*). The benefit of **non-action** (*wúwéi*).

The *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Chapter of Naturalness*) says: The **Dao of Heaven and Earth** (*Tiāndì zhī dào*) is **complete** (*bèi*) through **non-action** (*wúwéi*), **obtained** (*dé*) without **seeking** (*qiú*). I thereby know its **non-action** (*wúwéi*) yet **is beneficial** (*yǒu yì*).

---

**The teaching of the unsaid** (*bùyán zhī jiào*), the *South Flower Sutra* says: In the **Age of High Antiquity** (*shànggǔ*), the **Sages** (*shèngrén*) practiced **the teaching of the unsaid** (*bùyán zhī jiào*), established **non-teaching** (*lì bùjiào*), sat without debate (*zuò bùyì*), **void** (*xū*) yet they went, **substantial** (*shí*) yet they returned. Thus, **the teaching of the unsaid** (*bùyán zhī jiào*) exists—those who act in **non-action** (*wúwéi*) yet their **heart is fulfilled** (*xīnchéng*).

The **Great Dao** (*dàdào*) does not proclaim itself, the **Great Discourse** (*dàbiàn*) does not speak. The benefit of **non-action** (*wúwéi*), the *South Flower Sutra* says: The **Mysterious Ancient Lord** (*Xuán gǔ zhī jūn*), in **non-action** (*wúwéi*) ruled the **world** (*tiānxìa*), merely **Heaven’s virtue** (*Tiāndé*) was all. **Non-action** (*wúwéi*) yet it is **Heaven** (*tiān*), **non-action** (*wúwéi*) yet it is **virtue** (*dé*). Above, **non-action** (*wúwéi*) prevails; below, **non-action** (*wúwéi*) also prevails. The **world** (*tiānxià*) rarely attains this. The *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: The **root of benefit** (*yǒuyì zhī běn*) lies in **non-benefit** (*wúyì*). Thus, **non-benefit** (*wúyì*) is harmful to governance, yet **beneficial to chaos** (*yǒuyì yú luàn*), and the **Mysterious Sage** (*Xuánshèng*) does not act. **Chapter of Name and Body** (*Míng yǔ shēn zhāng*) **Forty-Fourth**: This chapter of the *South Flower Sutra* speaks: **The unbenevolent** (*bùrén*) yet greedy for **wealth, honor, fame, and profit** (*fùguì mínglì zhī huì*), in turn harm their **body** (*shēn*). The **King of Chu** (*Chǔ wēiwáng*) heard of **Zhuang Zhou’s** (*Zhuāng Zhōu*) virtue (*xián*), sent envoys with **rich gifts** (*hòubì zhī*), offering him the position of **prime minister** (*xiàng*), and **Zhuang Zhou** told the **Chu envoy** (*Chǔ shǐ*): "A thousand **gold** (*jīn*), heavy **profit** (*zhònglì*); **prime minister** (*xiàng*), an **exalted position** (*zūnwèi*). Have you not seen the **sacrificial ox** (*xīniú*) of the **autumnal sacrifice** (*jiāojì*)? Nurtured and fed for **many years** (*shùsuì*), adorned with **embroidered patterns** (*wénxiù*), given **grain and beans** (*chúshū*), until it is led into the **grand temple** (*tàimiào*), even if it wished to be a **lonely calf** (*gǔdú*), could it obtain this? I hasten to depart, lest I be **defiled** (*wū*). **Rulers** (*yǒuguó zhě*) are **captured** (*jī*), yet **Zhuang Zhou** served none his whole life, **self-contented** (*zìkuài*) in the **Dao of non-action** (*wúwéi zhī dào*).

The **Lord of Lu** (*Lǔ jūn*) heard that **Yan He** (*Yán Huò*) was a **man of the Dao** (*dézhī rén*), sent envoys with **gifts** (*bì*) first. **Yan He** did not accept them, truly **hating wealth and honor** (*zēn wù fùguì*). Hence it is said: The **true Dao** (*dàozhī zhēn*) is used to **cultivate the body** (*zhìshēn*), its **leftover threads** (*xùyú*) for **states**, its **coarse husks** (*tǔjū*) to **govern the world** (*zhìtiānxìa*). Observed thus, the **functions of emperors and kings** (*dìwáng zhī gōng*) are the **leftover tasks** (*shèngrén zhī yúshì*) of the **Sages**, not what is used to **perfect the body and nurture life** (*wánshēn yǎngshēng*). Today’s **common scholars** (*jūnzǐ*) often **endanger their body and abandon life** (*wēishēn qìshēng*) to **sacrifice themselves for things** (*xùnwù*) in **name and profit** (*mínglì*). Is this not tragic?

Now, there is a man here who uses the **Sui Hou’s jade** (*Suìhóu zhī zhū*) to shoot a **thousand-ren high bird** (*qiān rèn zhī què*). The **world** (*shì*) would surely **mock him** (*xiào*), why? Because what he **employs** (*suǒyòng*) is **heavy** (*zhòng*), yet what he **desires** (*suǒyào*) is **light** (*qīng*). Life (*shēng*) is not merely the **weight** (*zhòng*) of **Sui Hou’s jade**—**name and profit** (*mínglì*) destroy the **body** (*shēn*). **Knowing sufficiency** (*zhīzú*) prevents **humiliation** (*rǔ*), **knowing restraint** (*zhīzhǐ*) avoids **peril** (*dài*). Thus, one may **endure long** (*chángjiǔ*). Hence this chapter was composed.

**Name and body** (*míng yǔ shēn*), which is more **intimate** (*qīn*)? The *South Flower Sutra* says: **Bo Yi, Shu Qi, Bao Jiao, and Jie Zi Yi** (*Bó Yí, Shū Qí, Bào Jiāo, Jiè Zǐ Tū*), these four **men** (*zǐ*), **valued name yet despised death** (*zhòngmíng qīngsǐ*). **Body and wealth** (*shēn yǔ huò*), which is more **abundant** (*duō*)? The *South Flower Sutra* says: In ancient times, **Jie** (*Jié*) killed **Guan Longfeng** (*Guān Lóngfēng*), **Zhou** (*Zhòu*) killed **Wang Zi Biduan** (*Wáng Zǐ Bǐgān*), hence **Guan Longfeng** was **beheaded** (*zhǎn*), **Wang Zi Biduan** was **flayed** (*pōu*), **Peng Hong** was **castrated** (*jiāng*), and **Zi Yu** was **minced** (*mí*). These four **virtuous men** (*xiánzhě*) were **greedy for fame and profit** (*hǎomínglì zhě*), yet their **bodies** (*shēn*) were not spared from **slaughter** (*lù*).

**Gain and loss** (*dé yǔ wáng*), which brings more **suffering** (*bìng*)? The *South Flower Sutra* says: These are the **kindred** (*shǔlèi*) of **Bo Yi, Shu Qi, Wang Zi Biduan, and Zi Yu** (*Bó Yí, Shū Qí, Bǐgān, Zǐ Yú*). Thus, it **discourses the Dao** (*lùndào*) of **long life, bodily safety, and joyful intent** (*chángshēng āntǐ lèyì zhī dào*), is it not **far removed** (*bù yì yuǎn*)?

Hence, **excessive love** (*shèn ài*) brings **great expenditure** (*dàfèi*), the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: The **patterns of tigers and leopards** (*hǔbào zhī wén*) come to be **shot** (*shè*), the **agility of monkeys and barbarians** (*yóudí zhī jié*) comes to be **trapped** (*gé*). **Chimes** (*míngzhuó*) are **self-destructive** (*zìhuǐ*) by **sound** (*shēng*), **oils and candles** (*gāojìng*) are **self-consumed** (*zìjiān*) by **brightness** (*míng*). **Martial prowess** (*wǔyǒng*) perishes from **strength and force** (*yīnqiángliáng*), **eloquent scholars** (*biànshì*) perish from **ability** (*yīnnéng*). **Excessive hoarding** (*duōzàng*) leads to **great loss** (*hòuwáng*).

The *South Flower Sutra* says: **Forest trees** (*shān mù*) **self-destroy** (*zìkòu*), **oils and candles** (*gāohuǒ*) **self-cook** (*zìjiān*). **Sweet osmanthus** (*guì*) can be **eaten** (*kěyǐ*), hence it is **peeled** (*bō*), **lacquer** (*qī*) can be **used** (*kěyǐ*), hence it is **cut** (*gē*). All **know** (*rén jiē zhī*) that **sweet osmanthus and lacquer** (*guì qī*) have **use** (*yòng*), yet **do not know** (*wúzhī*) that the **oak tree** (*lìshù*), though **useless** (*wúyòng*), **preserves its life until Heaven’s end** (*dézhōng tiānnián*). **Knowing sufficiency** (*zhīzú*) prevents **humiliation** (*rǔ*).

The *South Flower Sutra*, **Zeng Zi** said: The **Son of Heaven** (*tiānzǐ*) cannot **obtain subjects** (*dé chén*), **feudal lords** (*zhūhóu*) cannot **obtain friends** (*dé yǒu*). **Nurturing the spirit** (*yǎngzhì zhě*) **forgets name** (*wàngmíng*), **nurturing the form** (*yǎngxíng zhě*) **forgets profit** (*wànglì*), **attaining the Dao** (*zhìdào zhě*) **forgets the heart** (*wàngxīn*). **Knowing restraint** (*zhīzhǐ*) avoids **peril** (*dài*).

The *Sutra of the Void and the Substantial* says: **Not greedy for wealth** (*bùtān huò*), why **covet profit** (*hé xiàn lì*)? **Not greedy for honor** (*bùtān guì*), why **covet name** (*hé xiàn míng*)? This is called **conforming to the people** (*shùnmín*). The *South Flower Sutra* says: **Name and profit** (*mínglì èr zhě*), **agitate the spirit** (*bózhì*). **Not stirring the heart** (*bùdòng xīnzhōng*) is **upright** (*zhèng*), **upright** (*zhèng*) is **void and tranquil** (*xūjìng wúwéi*) yet **non-doing** (*wúwéi*), and thus **nothing remains undone** (*wú bùwéi*). One may **endure long** (*chángjiǔ*).

The *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Jade and jade-like vessels** (*bìyàn zhī qì*), the **craft of carving** (*zhuāngyǒu zhī gōng*); **knives and hatchets** (*liàngzhǐ duànlì*), the **strength of whetstones** (*dǐlì zhī lì*). **Cunning hares die, yet hounds are boiled** (*jiǎotù sǐ ér lièquǎn pēng*), **high fowl are exhausted, yet fine bows are stored** (*gāoqín jìn ér liánggōng cáng*), **enemy states are annihilated, yet scheming ministers perish** (*dígú miè ér móuchén wáng*). **When the task is complete, withdraw** (*gōngsuì shēntuì*), such is **Heaven’s Dao** (*Tiāndào*). One may **endure long** (*chángjiǔ*).

**Chapter of Great Achievement as if Deficient** (*Dàchéng ruò quē zhāng*) **Forty-Fifth**: This chapter of the *South Flower Sutra* speaks: Though **Heaven and Earth** (*tiāndì*) are vast, their **transformations** (*huà*) are **uniform** (*jūn*). Though **all things** (*wànwù*) are numerous, their **governance** (*zhì*) is **one** (*yī*). Though **people** (*réncú*) are many, their **master** (*zhǔ*) is **only the lord** (*wéijūn*). The lord **originates from virtue** (*yuán yú dé*) yet **achieves through Heaven** (*chéng yú tiān*), hence it is said: The **Mysterious Ancient Lord** (*Xuán gǔ zhī jūn*), in **non-action** (*wúwéi*) ruled the **world** (*tiānxìa*), merely **Heaven’s virtue** (*Tiāndé*) was all. Thus, the **Sages of High Antiquity** (*dàgǔ shèngrén*) were **greatly skilled yet seemingly clumsy** (*dàqiǎo ruò zhuō*), **greatly eloquent yet seemingly tongue-tied** (*dàbiàn ruò nè*). **Embodying the Dao** (*tǐdào*), they were **void and tranquil** (*qīngjìng wúwéi*), **the rectifiers of the world** (*tiānxià zhī zhèng*), **teaching the use of the inexhaustible** (*jiào qí yòng wúqióng*). Thus they could **endure long** (*chángjiǔ*), hence this chapter was composed.

**Great achievement as if deficient** (*dàchéng ruò quē*), the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Heaven’s roundness** (*Tiān yuán*) does not **conform to compasses** (*zhōng guī*), **Earth’s square** (*dìfāng*) does not **conform to rulers** (*zhōng jǔ*). The **Dao** (*dào*) is the **greatest** (*zhìdà*), yet it has **no compasses or rulers** (*wú guījǔ*). Its **use is not exhausted** (*qí yòng bùbì*).

The *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Void and tranquil** (*qīngjìng*) is the **mirror of the Dao** (*dào zhī jiàn*). **Void and pure** (*qīngxū*) is **Heaven’s brightness** (*tiān zhī míng*). **One yet unchanging** (*yī ér bùbiàn*), **the utmost of tranquility** (*jìng zhī zhì*). **Great fullness as if empty** (*dàyíng ruò chōng*), the *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Heaven’s rectitude** (*tiānzhèng*) does not **conform to hooks** (*zhōng gōu*), **Earth’s straightness** (*dìzhí*) does not **conform to plumb lines** (*zhōng shéng*). **Virtue** (*dé*) is the **greatest** (*zhìdà*), yet it has **no hooks or plumb lines** (*wú gōushéng*). Its **use is inexhaustible** (*qí yòng bùqióng*).

The *Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says: **Non-action** (*wúwéi*) is the **constant of the Dao** (*dào zhī cháng*). **Non-action** yet it is **Heaven** (*wúwéi wéizhī tiān*), merely **Heaven’s virtue** (*tiāndé*) was all.

**The Way’s Great Straightness as if Bent**
*The Zhuangzi* says:
In ancient times, there was the constant Dao of the world—
the curved was not measured by hooks,
the straight was not measured by plumb lines,
**the greatest straightness as if bent.**

**The Way’s Great Skill as if Clumsy**
*The Zhuangzi* says:
In ancient times, there was the constant virtue of the world—
the round was not measured by compasses,
the square was not measured by squares,
**the greatest skill as if clumsy.**

**The Way’s Great Eloquence as if Tongue-Tied**
*The Zhuangzi* says:
The Great Dao does not speak,
the greatest eloquence does not argue,
**the greatest eloquence as if tongue-tied.**

**Agitation Overcomes Cold**
*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:
When **yang-qi** prevails, it transforms into **yin**,
thus **skill cannot be overfilled.**

**Tranquility Overcomes Heat**
*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:
When **yin-qi** prevails, it transforms into **yang**,
thus **eloquence cannot be pushed to extremes.**

**Pure Tranquility as the World’s Rectitude**
*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:
The ancient sages, who practiced **non-action**,
guarded **stillness**—
guarding stillness could rectify the world.

**Chapter 46: When the World Has the Dao**
This chapter from *The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Upper Virtue Section*) says:
In ancient times, those who wielded arms did not covet lands or riches,
but acted when danger loomed, pacifying chaos and removing harm for the people—
thus turning peril into security.
The **Red Sovereign** brought great calamity,
so the **Yellow Emperor** subdued him.
**Gonggong** caused the flood disaster,
so **Zhuànxū** executed him.
Now the Seven States are without the Dao—
greedy, covetous men ravage the world,
the people restless, finding no peace.
When the Dao is absent, arms are used—
warhorses roam the suburbs,
the world descends into great disorder.

**When the World Has the Dao**
*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Precision and Sincerity Section*) says:
In ancient times, those who summoned the distant
let them act in **non-action**,
and those nearby
were told to do nothing—
only those who walked secretly in the Dao
could truly possess it.

**Turning Warhorses to Manure**
*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Precision and Sincerity Section*) says:
Turning warhorses to manure,
their tracks do not reach beyond the farthest lands—
this is called **sitting while galloping, floating while submerged.**

**When the World Lacks the Dao**
*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:
In the Spring and Autumn period, when the world lacked the Dao,
war became the master of chaos.
Warhorses roamed the suburbs.
*The Sutra of the Cavern Spirit* says:
Now, in the Spring and Autumn era, few rulers had the Dao,
while many lacked it—
one cannot abandon the root for the branches,
nor use war as the primary means.

**No Greater Crime Than Covetousness**
*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:
**No greater crime than lacking the Dao.**
Fighting over trivial matters, unable to restrain the heart—
this is **the army of rage**, and thus it fails.
This is the Dao of Heaven.

**No Greater Calamity Than Insatiability**
*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:
**No greater calamity than lacking virtue.**
Taking others’ lands, desiring their wealth—
this is **the army of greed**, and thus it perishes.
This is the Dao of Heaven.

**No Greater Blame Than Desiring More**
*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:
**No greater blame than lacking virtue.**
Relying on the greatness of one’s state,
boasting of one’s people’s multitude,
and seeking to surpass enemy nations—
this is **the army of arrogance**, and thus it is destroyed.
This is the Dao of Heaven.

Thus, **knowing sufficiency is sufficiency itself.**
*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:
In ancient times, those who nurtured life knew sufficiency—
thus crime did not burden them.

---
**Chapter 47: Not Leaving the Door**
This chapter from *The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:
In ancient times, rulers taught without leaving their doors,
knowing thus the governance of the world—
observing things through things,
knowing people through people.
First cultivating oneself, then one could govern the people.
Ordering the home and managing affairs,
only then could one extend to officials and the world—
thus the world was governed.

Later generations issued ever-farther decrees,
bringing chaos and confusion,
while those who knew governance grew fewer—
for they did not cultivate their own roots.

Thus the ancient sages practiced **non-action**,
rectifying themselves,
and without commands, their virtue took hold;
without movement, their wisdom was known;
without being seen, their names were honored;
without action, their deeds were complete—
the world self-governed.

**Not Leaving the Door, Knowing the World**
*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Precision and Sincerity Section*) says:
In ancient times, teaching did not leave the door
to know the world’s governance—
this speaks of **precision and sincerity in non-action**, emanating from within.
*The Zhuangzi* says:
The ancients governed their inner selves by the Dao,
and did not govern the outer.

**Without Gazing Through the Window, Seeing the Dao of Heaven**
*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:
Not gazing through the window to see the Dao of Heaven—
this speaks of **spirit and qi**, pure and tranquil, moving with Heaven.

**The Farther One Goes, the Less One Knows**
*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* (□ *Nine Guardians Section*) says:
The farther one’s actions extend,
the less one knows—
this speaks of **spirit and vitality** in **action**,
which must not be allowed to stray outward.
*The Zhuangzi* says:
Now people govern the outer while neglecting the inner.

**The Less One Knows**
*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:
When **precision and sincerity** stray outward,
and **thought and calculation** scatter inward,
one cannot govern.
When the **form and spirit** are used far,
what is neglected grows near—
thus one knows less.

*The Zhuangzi* says:
Now people guard the outer while neglecting the inner.

Thus the sage,
*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:
**The root of no-command lies in rectifying oneself.**

**Without Movement, Knowing**
*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:
The ancient sages cultivated the root—
their bodies issued no commands yet restrained,
they did not act yet were benevolent,
they did not move yet were wise.

**Without Being Seen, Named**
*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:
The ancient sages cultivated the root—
their eyes did not gaze yet were clear,
their ears did not listen yet were sharp,
they were not seen yet their names were honored.

**Without Action, Achieved**
*The Sutra of Penetrating Mystery* says:
The ancient sages cultivated the root—
they did not speak yet were trusted,
they did not seek yet obtained,
they did not act yet succeeded.

---
**Chapter 48: Daily Learning Increases**
This chapter from *The Zhuangzi* says:
In ancient times, the Three Sovereigns—
the people used knotted cords and had no writing,
and in such times, the world was at **great peace**—
this was the governance of the Dao.

Now it has come to this:
people stretch their necks and lift their feet to attend lectures,
saying, *“There is a sage in such-and-such a place,”*
and with exhausted provisions, they rush to learn—
abandoning their inner duties and outer service to their lords.
Thus, warhorses’ tracks connect the states,
and chariot ruts stretch a thousand *li*—
the world descends into great disorder.

This is the chaos of learning—
it is the fault of the rulers above who love knowledge and learning.

For those who love knowledge and learning to bring chaos to the world,
it began with the Three Kings and their descendants,
who still valued literary arts as the way.

They abandoned the simple and pure people,
and delighted in the scheming, laboring, and cleverly learned flatterers,
discarding the tranquil, effortless Dao,
and taking pleasure in the clamor and superficiality of words.

The clamor and superficiality of words,
the shallow and ornate learning of later scholars,
has already spread its disorder across the world.

*Daily Learning Increases*, the *Tongxuan Jing* says:
The Zhou era was vast in learning and abundant in eloquence,
yet it could not escape chaos.

Now, if we take petty learning as education,
we cannot attain the great Dao’s clarity and establish the sage.
If we cling only to written laws,
governing the world will be difficult indeed.

*The Way Daily Decreases*
The *Nanhua Jing* says: In ancient times, those who cultivated the Dao did so by daily diminishing.
Diminishing again and again,
the *Nanhua Jing* says: Diminishing again and again.
Until they reached *wuwei*.
The *Nanhua Jing* says: Until they reached *wuwei*.
*Wuwei* yet nothing remained undone.
The *Nanhua Jing* says: *Wuwei* yet nothing remained undone—
above, there was *wuwei*,
below, there was also *wuwei*.

To take the world,
one must always act with *wu* (no affairs).
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ancient skillful rulers,
took the world yet had no affairs.

The root of *wu* (no affairs) lies in the Dao’s daily diminishing.
When affairs arise,
the *Tongxuan Jing* says: Wood breeds worms, which return as its rot;
people breed affairs, which return as their thieves.

Each follows what they delight in,
only to harm themselves in return.
With learning as their affair,
and affairs used to stop affairs,
it is like stirring water yet hoping for clarity—
difficult indeed,
and insufficient to take the world.

Insufficient to take the world.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Those of high station cannot be burdened with affairs;
if affairs burden them, governing is difficult,
and insufficient to take the world.

**Chapter Forty-Nine: The Sage Has No Fixed Heart**

This chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* states: In later ages, those who promulgated laws and offered rewards yet failed to transform customs and mores did so because their governance and punishments did not align with the Dao. In ancient times, the sage listened to the people’s music and knew their customs; observed their rituals and knew their mores; saw their mores and understood their transformation. Knowing the Dao’s unity, though he spoke not a word, all under heaven and the myriad people were transformed by him. This was because he sought only one thing: sincere adherence to the Dao—the supreme virtue of divine transformation.

Thus it is said: The sage has no fixed heart; he takes the people’s heart as his own. Nurturing the people as an infant, all under heaven will return to him.

The sage has no fixed heart.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ancient sage’s heart, night and day, never forgot benefiting the people. His virtue extended far, reaching the four seas.

Taking the people’s heart as his own.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: When the sage is above, the realm is governed; when below, the people emulate his intentions.

To the virtuous, I am virtuous.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ancient sage saw virtue as if he could not attain it himself; saw vice as if it were an omen. Teaching without descending from his hall, he rectified all under heaven. The people transformed and turned toward goodness—this was because he sought only his own virtue.

To the wicked, I am also virtuous.
Virtue is power.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ancient rulers saw gains as belonging to the people, losses as their own, and in retreat, blamed themselves.

To the trustworthy, I trust them.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Trust is the noble’s word; loyalty, the noble’s intent. When loyalty and trust manifest within, they resonate without—this is the transformation of the worthy and sage.

To the untrustworthy, I also trust them.
Virtue is trust.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ancient rulers saw righteousness as belonging to the people, perversity as their own, and in retreat, blamed themselves.

The sage in all under heaven.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The fundamental duty of governing is to secure the people.
The *Nanhua Jing* says: The ancient rulers saw one person lose their form and in retreat blamed themselves.

Diligent, for all under heaven.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ancient perfect ones refined their sincerity within, their virtue flowing to the four quarters. Seeing benefit for all under heaven, they rejoiced yet did not forget; seeing harm for all under heaven, they grieved as if in mourning.

Unified in heart.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Thus, to rejoice with all under heaven, to grieve with all under heaven—yet never failing to rule—is without precedent.

The people all focus their ears and eyes.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: He who grieves with the people’s grief, the people also grieve his grief; he who rejoices with the people’s joy, the people also rejoice his joy.

The sage treats them all as children.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Above views below as children, below views above as father; above views below as younger siblings, below views above as elder brothers. Viewing below as children—thus ruling all under heaven; viewing above as father—thus rectifying all under heaven; viewing below as younger siblings—thus not causing their deaths through hardship.

**Chapter Fifty: Birth and Death**

This chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* states: Today, the seven kingdoms’ lords and ministers engage in birth-and-death struggles—knowing the suitability of lands, mastering the advantages of rugged terrain, discerning the shifts of oppressive governance, and probing military formations. Blades clash, arrows fly, the wounded are carried, blood flows for thousands of *li*, bones litter the wilds. Victory and defeat both bring ruin, and war becomes the realm of death—not the way of those who truly nurture life.

Truly, those ancient masters who skillfully governed their troops avoided the death-ground of arms—this was excellence. Now, the seven kingdoms’ arms have become that death-ground.

Birth and death.
The *Dongling Jing* says: There is one who, in war, can revive the dead. Used well, it brings fortune; used poorly, it brings calamity.

The living, thirteen in number.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: There are those who die unnaturally, not by fate. The few attack the many; the weak assault the strong—soldiers kill them.

The dead, thirteen in number.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Skilled warriors kill, each according to their desires, only to harm themselves in return. Killing ten thousand, they lose three thousand of their own.

Human life.
The *Dongling Jing* says: Human nature desires life and abhors death.

Driven to the death-ground.
The *Tongxuan Jing* [□ *Upper Virtue Section*] says: War kills and wounds—thus it is called the death-ground.
Also thirteen in number.
The *Chongxu Jing* says: War is the death-ground, yet half who fight die in it.

Why is this so?
The *Tongxuan Jing* [□ *Nine Guards*] says: Why do the people of the seven kingdoms not complete their natural years? It is because of war’s slaughter.

Because of their thick accumulation of life.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Thus, because of their thick accumulation of life.

Truly, those who nurture life well.
The *Chongxu Jing* says: Even those who seek to nurture life do not rely on beasts—bears, tigers, leopards, and panthers serve as their banners, yet outwit them.

Traveling by land, they avoid rhinoceroses and tigers.
The *Nanhua Jing* says: To traverse water without fearing dragons is the fisherman’s courage; to travel land without fearing rhinoceroses and tigers is the hunter’s courage.

Entering battle, they do not don armor.
The *Nanhua Jing* says: When blades clash before them and they regard death as life, this is the warrior’s courage.

The rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn.
The *Nanhua Jing* says: In the age of supreme virtue, beasts gathered in herds—thus they could be tethered and led without harming people.

The tiger has no place to strike with its claws.
The *Nanhua Jing* says: In the age of supreme virtue, men dwelled with beasts—thus they could climb and peer among them without danger.

Weapons find no place to wield their blades.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times, deceit and evil did not arise, peace and ease prevailed, the world was harmonious, and the wise had no need to employ their strategies, nor did the brave need to wield their might. Why is this?
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times, the strong did not oppress the weak, the many did not tyrannize the few, and people preserved their lives without dying young. Why? It was because there was no place for war and death.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times, calamities and disasters did not arise, nor did misfortunes and chaos take shape—the world was at great peace, for there was no place for death.

**Chapter Fifty-One: "Dao Generates"**
This chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* states:
Form does not arise without Dao; life does not flourish without virtue/power. Thus, Dao abides in nature, and virtue/power sustains life.
Dao and virtue/power—these are the great furnace of heaven and earth, the great alchemist of transformation, using yin and yang as fuel and the four seasons as timing to mold all things.
When spring’s breath unfurls, all grasses sprout;
When autumn arrives, all treasures mature.
Metal and stone cannot but resound—
They store Dao’s qi.
All things cannot but thrive—
This is their Way, is it not?
Carving and shaping myriad forms, yet Dao does not contrive artifice.

The **Heavenly Gate**—it does not exist.
All things emerge from non-existence,
All things have being in birth,
Yet none see their root—
They emerge, yet none see their gate;
They are born, they die, they emerge, they return—
Entering and exiting without revealing form—
This is called the **Heavenly Gate**.

Heaven does not give birth, yet all things are nurtured;
Earth does not grow, yet all things transform.
Heaven and Earth act without action,
Yet all things act without fail.
It is Dao that generates all things.

Dao generates them,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Dao is that which nurtures and sustains growth.
Without generation or growth, all things could not flourish.
To generate and sustain—
This is called the **Great Dao** generating all things.

Virtue/power nourishes them,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Virtue/power is that which nurtures and feeds.
Without nurturing or feeding, all things could not mature.
To nurture and feed—
This is called **Heaven’s virtue/power** sustaining all things.

Form shapes them,
The *Tongxuan Jing*: Heaven’s movement through the four seasons, rain and dew descending in due time—this generates all things.
Momentum completes them.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Earth’s depth bears all things, containing and responding to their uses—this nourishes all things.
Thus, all things do not fail to revere Dao and honor virtue/power.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: That which gives birth to things is Dao.
That which sustains their growth is virtue/power.
Dao’s preservation of life, virtue/power’s securing of form—
Dao and virtue/power are the parent and mother of all things.

Dao is revered, virtue/power is honored,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Dao is what the people revere.
Virtue/power is what the people honor.
None confer rank upon it,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: What the world reveres and ranks is Dao.
The *Nanhua Jing* says: Where Dao resides, the sage honors it—how dare any not revere it?
Yet it remains ever natural.
The *Nanhua Jing* says: The Way of Heaven and Earth—
None act upon it, yet it acts naturally.

Thus, Dao—
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Heaven’s Way is pattern, Earth’s Way is principle, yin and yang are the rhythms, the four seasons are the messengers. It is called Dao.
Sweet rains descend in season, the five grains flourish and multiply, and all things are born and completed.
To generate and nurture,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Spring generates all things.
All things are born at the spring equinox—
To generate and nurture.
To lengthen and cultivate,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Summer lengthens all things.
All things grow in full summer—
To lengthen and cultivate.
To complete and ripen,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Autumn harvests all things.
All things mature at the autumn equinox—
To complete and ripen.
To nourish and shelter,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Winter stores all things.
To gather and preserve without increasing wealth,
To distribute and receive without adding poverty—
To nourish and shelter.
The *Nanhua Jing* says: None are as divine as Heaven, none as abundant as Earth.
They nourish all things yet do not claim righteousness,
Their blessings extend to all ages yet they do not claim benevolence.
They give birth yet do not possess,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Great Constant Dao generates things yet does not possess what it generates. None see its nurturing, yet all things grow—
This is called the **mysterious, effortless Dao**.

The *Chongxu Jing* says: Thus, all things that have color have Dao coloring their colors.
All things colored by color reveal their hues,
Yet Dao colors all things’ colors without ever displaying its own hue—
This is the Dao’s role of **effortless action**.

It acts yet does not rely,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Great Constant Dao—
All things depend on it for their growth,
Yet none see what it grows—
This is called the **mysterious, effortless Dao**.
The *Chongxu Jing* says: Thus, all things that have sound have Dao sounding their sounds.
All things sounded by sound reveal their tones,
Yet Dao sounds all things’ sounds without ever emitting its own—
This is the Dao’s role of **effortless action**.

It lengthens yet does not rule,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Great Constant Dao transforms and completes without governing. None know its virtue/power—
This is called the **mysterious, effortless Dao**.
The *Chongxu Jing* says: Thus, all things that have taste have Dao tasting their tastes.
All things tasted by taste reveal their flavors,
Yet Dao tastes all things’ tastes without ever presenting its own—
This is the Dao’s role of **effortless action**.

This is called **mysterious virtue/power**.
The *Chongxu Jing* says: Dao can be yin, can be yang,
Can be soft, can be hard,
Can be short, can be long,
Can be round, can be square,
Can give birth, can die,
Can bring heat, can bring cold,
Can float, can sink,
Can be high-pitched, can be low,
Can emerge, can vanish,
Can be dark, can be yellow,
Can be sweet, can be bitter,
Can be rancid, can be fragrant.

The Dao is without knowing, without ability—
Dao is without action, yet all things are without not-knowing, without not-ability, without not-action.
This is called **mysterious virtue/power**, the role of **effortless action**.

**Chapter Fifty-Two: The Beginning of All Things**
This chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* states:
Heaven has six poles and five phases,
Yet governs without action.
When emperors and kings follow without action, the realm is governed;
When they oppose without action, disaster ensues.

The affairs of the Nine Regions,
When governance is complete and virtue/power is full,
Overseeing the common folk,
The realm bears them—
This is called the **Supreme Sage**.

The ancient rulers of the world,
Though their wisdom rivaled Heaven and Earth,
Did not ponder for themselves;
Though their eloquence surpassed all things,
They did not boast for themselves;
Though their abilities exhausted the land,
They did not act for themselves.

Heaven does not produce yet all things transform,
Earth does not grow yet all things nurture,
The emperor and king act without action yet the realm prospers,
The Sage follows the Dao without action yet the realm is governed.

The world has a beginning,
The *Tongxuan Jing* [□Natural Section] says:
The world has a beginning,
Yet none know its principle—
Only the ancient Sage could know it.
Thus Heaven and Earth were completed,
Yin and Yang took form,
All things were born,
And the Dao named them—
Without words, without deeds,
This is **effortless action**.

This is the **Mother of the World**.
The *Tongxuan Jing* [□Sincere Section] says:
The Son of Heaven takes Heaven and Earth as his standard,
All things as his resources,
His virtue and power being most sublime,
His prestige and name most weighty,
The beauty of these two virtues/powers matches Heaven and Earth—
Thus he cannot but follow the Great Dao as the **Mother of the World**.

Once he has obtained its Mother,
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
Heaven and Earth act without action.
Yet he does not fail to act—
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
Once he knows its children,
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
The Great Dao acts without action yet without failing to act.
Returning again to guard its Mother,
The *Nanhua Jing* says:
The Sage above guards without action while things transform effortlessly.
His body perishes yet he is not harmed—
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
The root of effortless action is to discard cleverness,
Close the four gates,
Cease the five passions,
Thus merging with the Dao.
Divine clarity hides in the formless,
Spirit merges with the True Dao,
His body perishes yet he is not harmed.

Seal its **joy**,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
The ancient Sage of old followed the Great Dao without action,
His mouth open yet not speaking,
His heart clear yet not pondering or scheming,
Straightforward in his natural emotions and wisdom—
Thus he could not be harmed.
So the essence remains in his mouth,
His speech is apt,
Gathers in his heart,
His thoughts are clear.
Moving the world without action,
He does not speak yet is public,
He does not scheme yet is wise.
Close its **gates**,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
The ancient Sage followed the Great Dao without action,
His ears keen yet not listening,
His eyes bright yet not seeing,
Forgotten yet not acting,
Wise yet not contriving—
Thus his essence remains in his ears,
His listening is keen,
Remains in his eyes,
His seeing is bright.
Moving the world without action,
He does not listen yet is keen,
He does not see yet is bright.
Thus his whole life is without toil—
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
Thus closing the four gates,
His whole life is without calamity,
His limbs and nine orifices do not generate desire or disease—
This is called the **True Person**.

Open its **joy**,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
Later generations, with partial enlightenment and contrived action,
Open their **joy**,
Speak with their mouths,
Scheme with their hearts,
Twisting eloquence to sway the world—
Their ears and eyes, though keen and bright,
Do not listen or see in accord with the Dao—
Thus their whole life is without salvation.

**Chapter Fifty-Three: The Sage’s Clarity**
This chapter of the *Dongling Jing* states:
From the recent past to now,
The world’s deceitful and perverse are many,
The upright and honest are few,
The frivolous and licentious are many,
The virtuous and retiring are few.

*(Note: "兑" [duì] was translated as "joy" in the previous section, but here it may also carry the connotations of "mouth" or "open expression" depending on context. For consistency, it is kept as "joy" in the first instance and "gates" in the second, where it aligns with the four gates [四关] mentioned earlier. "九洛" [Jiǔ Luò] and "九窍" [Jiǔ Qiào] are translated as "Nine Regions" and "nine orifices" respectively, following the previous context. "九洛" may also be interpreted as "Nine Passes" or "Nine Rivers," but "Nine Regions" is retained for parallelism with the previous section.)*

The deceitful and perverse in speech deceive the loyal and upright,
Thus causing the people of the world to mutually indulge in licentiousness and corruption.

In ancient times, Heaven acted naturally and Earth remained tranquil,
Ten thousand things refined and transformed of their own accord—
Ghosts and spirits lacked efficacy.

In the latter age, the Son of Heaven is strange and eccentric,
Great ministers are bizarre and perverse—
Then the arts of ghosts and spirits arise.

When the spirits are enraged, it is not because they are not worshipped.
When licentious rites prevail, the spirits grow ever angrier.
When the people favor shortcuts, they turn to ghosts and spirits.

Licentious rites pervade the world, corrupting customs and fostering omens of calamity—
Families are ruined, livelihoods lost.

*—The *Chongxu Jing* states:*
As benevolence and righteousness decline, the people’s nature grows thin—
The Dao cannot prevail.

*—The *Tongxuan Jing* states:*
If one listens to wise counsel and acts accordingly,
Even the foolish know to take joy in it.
If one praises the saintly virtue and noble conduct,
Even the unworthy know to emulate it.

*—The *Tongxuan Jing* states:*
Those who delight in the Great Dao are many,
Yet those who practice it are few;
Those who aspire to it are many,
Yet those who truly walk it are few.
Only the wise fear this.

*—The *Chongxu Jing* states:*
If the Dao does not prevail,
A single kingdom may yet endure as in years past—
But how can the world and future generations endure?

The Great Dao is most simple,
*—The *Tongxuan Jing* states:*
The Great Dao is broad and easy—
It lies not far from the self.
Seek it near, yet return empty-handed.
The people love shortcuts.

*—The *Tongxuan Jing* states:*
The people greatly favor perverse shortcuts,
Turning to ghosts and spirits.
Licentious rites prevail, the spirits grow ever angrier.

*—The *Dongling Jing* states:*
The foundation of governance lies in securing the people.
If the times are not oppressive,
Yet one seizes upon laborious projects—
This is called great calamity.

*—The *Chongxu Jing* states:*
Qi and Lu abound in ingenuity,
With skilled artisans in earth and wood.

*—The *Dongling Jing* states:*
Fields lie overgrown—
People abandon essential pursuits for trivial ones.

In ancient times, the sage-kings governed by first attending to agriculture.
When the people tilled the land, they were simple,
And simplicity made them easy to guide—
Thus the borders were secure.

When the people turned to farming, they became youthful,
Youthful, they held less to private affection and more to public law.

*—The *Tongxuan Jing* discusses the laws of Shennong:*
If men of prime strength do not plow,
There will be those who starve in the world;
If women of childbearing age do not weave,
There will be those who freeze in the world.
Thus the Emperor himself plowed,
And the Empress herself wove—
Setting an example for the world.

Therefore, those who till do not toil excessively,
For they have no means to sustain life;
Those who weave do not labor excessively,
For they have no means to clothe the body.
When food and clothing are abundant,
Deceit and perversity do not arise.

To preserve the essentials of the seasons,
One must reduce unnecessary pursuits.
*—The *Dongling Jing* states:*
Agriculture yields food, artisans yield tools, merchants yield goods—
Grain is the people’s Heaven.
Thus, when a sage-king arises, he prioritizes agriculture.
If a king does not prioritize agriculture,
He abandons the people—
What kingdom can he then rule?

*—The *Tongxuan Jing* states:*
The sage-king enriches his people,
The conqueror enriches his land,
The endangered state enriches its historians,
The well-governed state finds sufficiency,
The doomed state suffers from empty granaries—
Thus it is said: *When the ruler has no burdens, the people prosper naturally.*

The foundation of sufficiency lies in not seizing the seasons.

*—The *Nanhua Jing* (Zhuangzi) states:*
In the latter age, what the people delight in
Are fine garments and beautiful colors,
Which confuse their minds and make them forget their duties—
This is called chaos.

*—The *Nanhua Jing* states:*
To teach the people’s customs,
Clothing should be plain, belts simple—
Modest and unadorned.

*—The *Nanhua Jing* (Zhuangzi) recounts how Zhuangzi admonished King Zhao of Yan for his love of swords:*
Zhuangzi said: *I have three swords—
One for the Son of Heaven, one for the feudal lords, one for the commoner.*
The king said: *I wish to hear of these three swords.*
Zhuangzi replied: *There is the sword of the Son of Heaven,
The sword of the feudal lords,
And the sword of the commoner.*
*Now, Your Majesty holds the position of the Son of Heaven,
Yet you delight in the sword of the commoner—
I humbly fear this for Your Majesty.*
The king then had the swords drawn and presented to him,
And the royal attendants served him food three times.
Zhuangzi said: *Your Majesty, remain seated and composed—
The matter of the swords is now complete.*
Thus, King Wen did not leave his palace for three months,
And all the swordsmasters perished in their homes.

*—The *Nanhua Jing* states:*
In the latter age, what the people delight in
Are rich flavors and music,
Which confuse their minds and make them forget their duties—
This is called chaos.

*—The *Nanhua Jing* states:*
To hoard wealth and take comfort in it,
To covet power and exhaust it,
To accumulate goods and seek profit—
This is called thievish arrogance.

*—The *Nanhua Jing* states:*
All these seven evils
Are the world’s greatest harms.
Yet people forget them and fail to discern—
Their desires sever from their bodies, yet they still covet—
Is this not delusion?

*—The *Chongxu Jing* states:*
When teaching is clear above and transformation spreads below,
The people have a sense of shame—
Why would there be thieves?
Thus, when governance aligns with the natural order,
Bandits flee and hide.

*—The *Tongxuan Jing* states:*
The foundation of pure transformation lies in rejecting artifice.

*—The *Nanhua Jing* states:*
Cunning, extravagance, and superficiality
Are insufficient to stabilize the world—
This is not the Dao.

**Chapter Fifty-Four: The Unshakable Builder**

*—The *Tongxuan Jing* records Wenzi asking:*
Master, your words say that without virtue and the Dao,
One cannot govern the world.
Yet in ancient times, kings inherited their predecessors’ legacies—
Some ruled without virtue, yet their ages endured without calamity.
How is this possible?

Laozi replied:
From the Son of Heaven down to the commoner,
Each lives their own life—
Yet life varies in depth.
The world at times sees ruined families and fallen states,
All due to the absence of virtue and the Dao.

If one remains ever vigilant, day and night,
Striving with fear and caution,
Guarding diligently without fail—
Then disaster is averted.

But if one indulges in desires and neglects duty,
Unable to guard diligently,
Then ruin comes without warning.

If Jie and Zhou had followed the Dao and cultivated virtue,
Even if Tang and Wu were wise,
They would have had no means to establish their deeds.

In ancient times, those who built well were unshaken,
Those who guarded well were unlost—
Thus their descendants continued sacrifices without interruption,
Their virtue never severed,
And the world endured for generations.

Those who build well are unshaken—
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says: In ancient times, those who built well were unshaken,
Meaning that the cultivation of virtue in building was without action or favor,
And they upheld modesty and frugality.

*The Scripture of the Numinous Spirit* says: King Wen acted with tranquility in advance and retreat,
And Heaven would surely assist him—
His fortune was divined as lasting thirty generations.

Those who embrace well are not abandoned—
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says: In ancient times, the sage-kings dwelled in great fullness yet did not overflow,
And in lofty nobility yet did not grow proud.
Dwelling in great fullness yet not overflowing,
This is how they long preserved their wealth;
Residing in lofty nobility yet not growing proud,
This is how they long preserved their honor.

*The Scripture of the Numinous Spirit* says: The virtue of King Wen was such that Jie could not harm it.
His longevity was foretold in dreams—
Seven hundred years, a command from Heaven.
Thus his descendants continued sacrifices without interruption.

*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says: Riches and honor never depart from their person,
And blessings extend to their offspring—
This was indeed the ancient royal Dao.
Cultivate it in oneself, and its virtue becomes true;
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* [*The Chapter of Subtle Clarity*] says:
Commoners and scholars alike, if they follow the Dao,
Will preserve their own lives—
Thus it is said: Cultivate it in oneself,
And its virtue becomes true.

*The Scripture of the South Flowering* says:
In antiquity, the five offices fulfilled their distinct duties,
And commoners governed themselves and cultivated their virtue—
This was the beauty of governance.

Cultivate it in the family, and its virtue becomes abundant;
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
In ancient times, great officials with the Dao
Did not lose their families—
Thus it is said: Cultivate it in the family,
And its virtue becomes abundant.

*The Scripture of the South Flowering* says:
Great officials governed themselves and cultivated their virtue—
This was the beauty of governance.

Cultivate it in the village, and its virtue becomes enduring;
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
In ancient times, prefects and counties with the Dao
Did not lose their villages—
Thus it is said: Cultivate it in the village,
And its virtue becomes enduring.

Cultivate it in the state, and its virtue becomes plentiful;
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
In ancient times, the feudal lords with the Dao
Did not lose their states—
Thus it is said: Cultivate it in the state,
And its virtue becomes plentiful.

*The Scripture of the South Flowering* says:
Feudal lords governed themselves and cultivated their virtue—
This was the beauty of governance.

Cultivate it in the world, and its virtue becomes universal.
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
In ancient times, the Son of Heaven with the Dao
Long held dominion over the world—
Thus it is said: Cultivate it in the world,
And its virtue becomes universal.

*The Scripture of the South Flowering* says:
The Son of Heaven governed himself and cultivated his virtue—
This was the beauty of governance.

Thus, observe oneself with oneself—
*The Scripture of the South Flowering* says:
In the latter ages, if the five do not cultivate,
No greater loss can there be.
Commoners not cultivating, lose their own lives.
Observe the family with the family—
*The Scripture of the South Flowering* says:
Great officials not cultivating, lose their families.
Observe the village with the village—
*The Scripture of the South Flowering* says:
Prefects and counties not cultivating, lose their villages.
Observe the state with the state—
*The Scripture of the South Flowering* says:
Feudal lords not cultivating, lose their states.
Observe the world with the world—
*The Scripture of the South Flowering* says:
The Son of Heaven not cultivating, loses his world.

How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
Not losing the root of the state lies in the virtue of guarding well—
Those who do not increase its substance yet expand its reach are ruined,
Those who do not broaden its foundation yet raise its height are overturned.

No burden is heavier than the beams,
No governance of the state is heavier than virtue.

*The Chapter of Embracing Virtue’s Depth* [This chapter, *The Scripture of the South Flowering* [*The Chapter of the Horse’s Hoof*], says:]
In the upper antiquity, the age of the Perfected Dao and Supreme Virtue,
Its people were like infants, pure as newborns.
Their actions were simple and unadorned,
They did not know east or west;
Their vision was unclouded,
They did not know darkness or light.

In that time, birds and beasts gathered in flocks,
Grasses and trees grew in abundance—
Thus, birds and beasts could be tethered and led about,
Yet they did not harm people;
The nests of crows and magpies could be climbed and observed,
Yet they did not injure people.

Beasts could not prey upon them,
Not because their virtue was thin—
Rather, they discerned safety and danger,
Settled in peace with calamity and fortune,
And were cautious in their choices—
None could harm them,
For this was the result of embracing virtue.

*The Scripture of the Void and the Primordial* says:
In the age of the Great Beginning,
Birds and beasts dwelled with humans,
And moved alongside them.
In the time of the Five Emperors and Three Kings,
Birds and beasts began to scatter in alarm.

By the latter ages,
Birds and beasts hid and fled, escaping their hardships.

*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
In the latter ages, the Dao declines and virtue thins—
Humans become the robbers,
And birds, beasts, insects, and serpents all harm people—
Thus, iron is cast and blades are forged to repel their dangers.

In the upper antiquity, virtue was profound,
Their nature was like that of a newborn babe—
Without the hearts of harm or gain,
They were simple and long-lived.

The depth of embracing virtue—
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
In ancient times, the treatment of the Perfected Ones
Was to embrace virtue and hold the Dao,
To be serene and content without arrogance,
And thus attain harmony—
Robbers and thieves did not act,
For this was the result of embracing virtue.

*The Scripture of the Void and the Primordial* says:
Embrace their virtue, and they harmonize with all things created.
Like a newborn babe—
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
In ancient times, the age of supreme virtue,
Its people were like infants, pure as those three months old,
Unknowing of harm or gain—
Robbers and thieves did not act,
For this was the governance of embracing virtue.

*The Scripture of the South Flowering* says:
Does the *Scripture of Vitality* teach the art of longevity?
All day long they move, yet do not know where they go,
They dwell, yet do not know what they do—
Their bodies are like withered branches of wood.
If such is their state,
Then calamity will not come,
Nor fortune arrive—
Calamity and fortune are nonexistent,
For evil men and malevolent things cannot harm them.

Poisonous creatures do not sting—
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* [*The Chapter of Pure Sincerity*] says:
In ancient times, the sage-king Fuxi ruled the world,
His virtue gave life yet did not kill.
At that time, even venomous serpents
Held their tail-poisons in concealment,
And their sting-poisons were hidden—
They did not bite people,
For this was the result of embracing virtue.

Fierce beasts did not attack—
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
In ancient times, the sage-king Fuxi ruled the world,
His virtue gave life yet did not kill.
At that time, even fierce beasts
Had their claws and teeth—
Yet the herds of running beasts could be tethered and led,
And they did not harm people,
For this was the result of embracing virtue.

Birds of prey did not strike.
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
In ancient times, the sage-king Fuxi ruled the world,
His virtue gave life yet did not kill.
At that time, even birds and beasts had their claws and talons—
Yet the nests of flying birds could be approached and explored,
And they did not harm people,
For this was the result of embracing virtue.

Bones were weak, sinews supple, yet their grasp was firm.
*The South华 Scripture* says:
The child held all day, yet his hands did not tire,
His virtue was one—
He gazed all day, yet his eyes did not strain,
For his mind was not outward.
This was the virtue of the Perfect Man.

Unknowing of male and female union yet life arose—
The essence was supreme.
*The South华 Scripture* says:
The child moved without purpose,
His body like a withered tree’s branch,
His heart like dead ashes—
This was the essence supreme.

*The Scripture of Void and Emptiness* says:
The infant brother’s wholeness.

Crying all day, yet his throat did not grow hoarse—
Harmony was supreme.
*The South华 Scripture* says:
The child cried all day, yet his throat did not grow hoarse,
For harmony was supreme.

To know harmony is to know constancy.
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* [*The Chapter of Lower Virtue*] says:
In the ancient times, life was cherished,
Life was valued above gain—
No harm came to the spirit,
And longevity was granted.
Thus it is said: To know harmony is to know constancy.

*The Scripture of Void and Emptiness* says:
In ancient times, the infant’s nature was pure,
Qi focused, will unified—
This was harmony supreme.
Nothing injured it,
No virtue surpassed it.

To know constancy is to know clarity.
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
Later generations valued gain above life,
This is called excessive harm.
Those who harm themselves thus have no longevity.
Thus it is said: To know constancy is to know clarity.

To benefit life is auspicious.
*The Scripture of Void and Emptiness* says:
In their youth, they were delicate and skilled,
Their fame and reputation were exaggerated in the world.
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
To benefit life is auspicious.

To let the heart command qi is strength.
*The Scripture of Void and Emptiness* says:
In their youthful vigor, blood and qi overflowed,
Desires and thoughts filled them,
They were assailed by external things,
And their virtue thus declined.
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
To let the heart command qi is strength.

When things are strong, they age.
*The Scripture of Void and Emptiness* says:
In their old age, desires and thoughts grew soft,
Their bodies neared rest,
Nothing could precede them.
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
The spirit, will, and qi—
When still, they grow daily stronger;
When agitated, they waste and age.
This is called *not-Dao*.
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
Some die young, not by fate but by self-harm,
Neglecting their bodies, letting illness kill them.
Only the tranquil and content can manifest virtue,
Thus, to act against the Dao is not virtue,
And none can endure long—
The world has none who live long against the Dao.
Not-Dao brings early death.
Not-Dao brings early death.

*The Scripture of Void and Emptiness* says:
In death, they return to stillness,
And return to their origin.

**Chapter Fifty-Six: The Silent Sage**
This chapter of *The South华 Scripture* speaks:
The ancient Dao and virtue were obscured by those who followed the various schools,
The Nine Flows heard their heterodox winds and rejoiced in them,
Using rigid rules to correct themselves,
To address the world’s urgencies,
They destroyed the ancient Dao and virtue,
And did not align with the former kings.

To govern the world and nourish the people—
What is this different from tending horses?
One removes only what harms the horses,
And those who harm the people.

The wise scholar without thought and contemplation is not content,
The eloquent scholar without discourse is not content,
The discerning scholar without judgment is not content—
All are constrained by things,
And have lost their Dao.

Those who attract the world’s favor rise in court,
The common scholars are honored in the halls,
The strong are praised for their strength,
The brave are celebrated for their daring,
The martial are delighted in war,
The ascetics cherish their names,
The legalists expand their governance,
The ritualists respect their forms,
The benevolent are esteemed for their connections.

Without accumulated wealth, the greedy grieve,
Without unrivaled power, the ambitious sorrow—
Those who rely on external things
Take pleasure in change and opportunity,
And cannot avoid causing harm.
The Nine Flows obstruct the Dao,
And learning becomes chaotic.

The sage does not speak.
*The South华 Scripture* says:
The ancient scholars did nothing, thought nothing, contemplated nothing,
And thus came to know the Dao.
The sage does not speak.
Those who speak do not know.

To block the mouth,
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* [*The Chapter of Lower Virtue*] says:
The ancient scholars blocked their mouths,
Their speech was cautious,
Great eloquence seemed stammering.

To close the gate,
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
The ancient scholars closed their gates,
Silent yet wise,
Great skill seemed clumsy.

To blunt the sharp,
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
The ancient scholars blunted the sharp,
Abandoning vigor and ambition,
No weapons were needed.

To resolve the tangled,
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
The ancient scholars resolved the tangled,
There was no strife or disorder,
And the world was at peace.

To harmonize their light,
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
The ancient scholars harmonized their light,
There was no resentment or defiance.

To blend with the dust,
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
The ancient scholars blended with the dust,
There was no contention or grievance.
This is called *Mystic Unity*.
*The South华 Scripture* says:
Yan Hui said:
To abandon limbs and senses,
To discard form and wisdom,
To merge with the Great Communion—
This is called *Sitting-Forgetting*.
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
All things are mystically unified,
Neither this nor that.

Thus it cannot be approached or avoided,
*The South华 Scripture* says:
The benevolent are esteemed for their connections,
The discerning scholar without judgment is not content.

It cannot be distanced or drawn near,
*The South华 Scripture* says:
The ritualists respect their forms,
The wise scholar without thought is not content.

It cannot be used for gain,
*The South华 Scripture* says:
The eloquent scholar without discourse is not content.

《The Scripture of Perfected Mystery》 says:
The resentful are contrary to *virtue/power*.
Strife is the source of human disorder.
To employ dark schemes contrary to *virtue/power* to suppress human disorder is the height of perversity.
One cannot bring calamity upon others unless they are already calamitous.
It cannot be used to cause harm;

*The South华 Scripture* says:
The bold and courageous delight in slaughter,
The martial scholars delight in war.

*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
Weapons are cruel instruments.
To delight in using cruel instruments to suppress human disorder is the height of perversity.
One cannot bring calamity upon others unless they are already calamitous.

It cannot be esteemed for its own sake;
*The South华 Scripture* says:
The noble do not take honor as their ease,
Nor rely on power to be revered.

Without glorying in *Mystic Unity*,
There is no *Daoist* resentment from Heaven.
Without being held in contempt,
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
One need not depend on wealth to be rich,
Nor fear disgrace as perilous.

Without being shamed by poverty,
There is no human censure.
Thus, one is held in highest esteem by the world.

*The South华 Scripture* says:
In ancient times, the sudden outburst of ambition was condemned.
Honor, wealth, high rank, splendid appearance, fame, and profit—
These six things are the sudden outburst of ambition.
If the heart remains unmoved,
Then one is upright.
Being upright,
One attains emptiness, tranquility, and non-action,
Yet nothing remains undone.

*The Collected Commentaries on the Four Children of the Daoist True Scripture* concludes Volume Seven,
Begins Volume Eight.

**Chapter Fifty-Seventh: Governing by the Dao**

*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* speaks:
In the Spring and Autumn era, the Warring States’ ambition gave rise to cunning and deceit, while theft and banditry flourished. The ruler and ruled harbored mutual resentment, and decrees failed to take hold.

When waters grow turbid, fish scatter;
When governance grows harsh, the people rebel.
Excessive prohibitions breed defiance below,
Excessive demands spawn contention.
Thus, applying the remedy of boiling water to boiling water only intensifies the heat—
One who understands *wuwei* as the foundation of governance knows to remove the fire itself.

Therefore it is said:
*"I practice non-action, yet the people transform themselves;
I cherish stillness, yet the people align themselves."*

The Five Hegemons’ reliance on arms and punishments bred bandits and chaos.

**Governing by the Dao,**
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* (□ *On Rites Above*) states:
To govern by the Dao, first establish policies that cannot be overcome,
Then seek victory over adversaries.
To attack a disordered state before it is pacified
Is like responding to fire with fire or water with water—
Opposites cannot govern one another;
This is called *increasing disorder*.

**Employing the Unconventional in Warfare,**
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
To employ the unconventional in warfare,
One must make the strange appear strange.
The unconventional in stillness appears agitated,
The unconventional in order appears chaotic,
The unconventional in abundance appears starved,
The unconventional in ease appears labored.

The interplay of the unconventional and the conventional
Is like the clash of water, fire, metal, and wood—
Wherever it turns, it prevails.

**Conquering the World Without Conflict,**
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
The ancient sage-rulers conquered the world without conflict.
How do I know this is so?
By this:
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
Excessive affairs are difficult to govern,
Harsh laws are difficult to enforce.
When taboos proliferate,
*The Scripture of the Cavern Spirit* says:
When customs overflow with taboos,
Emotions stagnate, and the world grows rigid;
When customs lack taboos,
Suppression and release flow freely, and joyous communication thrives.
Yet the people grow ever poorer.

When sharp weapons abound,
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
Heavy armor and sharp blades cannot be relied upon for strength.
When the state grows ever more corrupt,
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
When rulers favor martial prowess and incite the people to contention,
The state faces endless calamity, and rebellion will surely follow.

When cunning and skill proliferate,
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
When cleverness and ingenuity flourish, strange things arise.
*The South华 Scripture* says:
Those who excel in cleverness, wisdom, and saintly virtue—
I alone consider myself lost among them.
When those who rely on cunning to overcome strength become too numerous,
Excessive precision will inevitably breed unworthy hearts in response,
Yet they remain unaware.

When laws and decrees multiply,
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
The art of governance lies not in eloquence.
When laws and decrees multiply, thieves and bandits thrive.
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
Cunning and deceit take root, and banditry spreads.
Thus the sages say:
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
Laws may kill the unfilial, yet cannot make one filial;
Punishments may deter thieves, yet cannot instill honesty.
In the latter ages, when the world fears punishment and dares not steal—
Is this not inferior to the ancient purity where no thief’s heart arose?
Thus, applying the remedy of boiling water to boiling water only intensifies the heat—
One who understands *wuwei* as the foundation of governance knows to remove the fire itself.

Therefore the sages say:
*"I practice non-action, yet the people transform themselves;
I desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity."*

*"I practice non-action, yet the people transform themselves,"*
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* (□ *On the Origin of the Dao*) says:
*"I practice non-action, yet the people transform themselves,
Thus the ruler practices non-action, and the people transform themselves."*

*"I engage in no affairs, yet the people grow rich,"*
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
*"I engage in no affairs, yet the people grow rich,
Thus the ruler engages in no affairs, and the people grow rich."*

*"I cherish stillness, yet the people align themselves,"*
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
*"I cherish stillness, yet the people align themselves,
Thus the ruler cherishes stillness, and the people align themselves."*

*"I desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity."*
*The Scripture of Perfected Mystery* says:
*"I desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity,
Thus the ruler desires nothing, and the people return to simplicity."*

**Chapter Fifty-Eighth: The Obscure Governance**

This chapter, from *The South华 Scripture* (□ *On the Redundant Thumb*), speaks:
Since the Three Sovereigns, how have the world’s rituals of benevolence and righteousness, its rules and measures, its hooks and cords, become so clamorous?
They carve and polish what is naturally upright in humanity.

Moreover, the Three Sovereigns relied on hooks and cords, rules and measures, to straighten what was already straight—
This was to chisel away at their natural uprightness.
They bound with cords and sealed with glue to solidify what was already firm—
This was to encroach upon their innate virtue.

They bent and folded rites and music,
They stifled and smothered benevolence and righteousness,
To pacify the world’s hearts—
This was to lose their natural order.

When governance is scrutinizing, the people grow weary;
In ancient times, the world had its natural order:
The crooked were not straightened with hooks,
The straight were not measured with cords,
The round were not circumscribed with compasses,
The square were not checked with rulers,
The separated were not glued together,
The bound were not restrained with ropes.

Thus the world spontaneously gave birth to all things, yet knew not how it came to be;
All things naturally attained their place, yet knew not how it happened.

When governance is obscure, the people are pure.
This principle is unchanging from ancient to modern—
It cannot be diminished.
Then why do benevolence and righteousness cling so tightly,
Like glue and cords, to wander between virtue and the Dao?

If governance is overly analytical,
It is like recklessly digging through walls to cultivate weeds—
Laboring without fruit.

The hair was simply unbound and combed,
The rice was merely counted and cooked—
Yet how could such modest means suffice to save the world?

The Three Sovereigns governed by discerning the people’s hardships.
When governance is obscure, the people are pure.
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* (上礼篇) says:
The waters of Ying are ten *ren* deep, yet they do not receive filth.
Jade and stone within reveal their forms without—
Not because they are not thick or clear,
But fish, turtles, dragons, and serpents do not dwell there.
No grains grow upon barren stone,
No deer roam the bald mountains—
For there is no shelter or refuge.

When governance is obscure, the people are pure.
When governance is scrutinizing, the people grow weary.
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
Later rulers govern with severity as discernment,
With harshness as clarity,
With cruelty as loyalty,
With scheming as merit.
Such rulers are like broad leather—
The wider they stretch, the more they tear.

When governance is scrutinizing, the people grow weary.
Calamity is the reverse of fortune.
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
Benefit and harm share a gate,
Calamity and fortune share a neighbor.
Thus it is said: Calamity is the reverse of fortune,
Fortune is the reverse of calamity.

The Three Sovereigns’ wisdom was shallow,
Then they relied on scrutiny.
Those who rely on scrutiny
Take the good from below to serve above, yet are deceived.
To scrutinize the traces of blades and brushes—
They know not the Way of *wuwei*,
They know the roots of chaos.
To be scrutinizing brings chaos,
Corrupts customs,
And breeds the winds of ruined states.
Who knows its ultimate end?
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
Calamity, fortune, benefit, harm—
None but the ancient sages could truly distinguish them.
Thus it is said: Who knows its ultimate end?
Is there no right or wrong?
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The ancients governed with righteousness and transformed with ease—
Later ages govern with deceit, and though difficult, they fail.
The right becomes the strange,
*The *Scripture of the Cavern Spirit* says:
In recent times, upright men are few.
When governance is simple, the people are pure and honest,
The common folk are virtuous—
They can be transformed, not punished.
The good becomes the monstrous.
*The *Scripture of the Cavern Spirit* says:
In recent times, the wicked are many.
When governance is burdensome and harsh, the people become deceitful.
To blame the many for their deceit—
Should you not first examine your own rectitude?
The people’s confusion has long endured.
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
Later ages take petty acts of benevolence and righteousness as their measure,
Yet those who know how to use hooks, cords, compasses, and rulers can govern men—
Without these tools, one cannot establish the square or round,
Without hooks and cords, one cannot straighten the crooked.
If the ruler relies on these tools,
The people below also harbor such scheming hearts—
They are clever devices, yet not the means to govern.

Thus the sage
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
Murky waters choke the fish,
Harsh governance breeds chaos in the people.
When the ruler’s desires multiply, the people’s deceit multiplies,
When the ruler is troubled, the people become unsettled.
Not knowing the root of *wuwei* for one person,
They seek to remedy it with the superficial laws of governance—
How different is this from digging canals to stop the flow of water,
Or embracing firewood to extinguish flames,
Yet calling it an increase?
Thus, to stop the boiling with a ladle only makes it worse—
He who knows the true method of governance removes the fire itself.

Therefore the sage governs with simplicity and achieves order,
Seeks few things and finds abundance,
For what he cultivates is the root.

Square yet not cutting,
Modest yet not stingy,
Straight yet not domineering,
Brilliant yet not dazzling—
These four, truly cultivated, are the Way of proper governance.

Square yet not cutting,
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* (道德篇) says:
The ancients governed with the Dao—
Square yet not cutting, and the people naturally conform.
*The *South Flower Sutra* says:
The ancients had the constant Way—
The square was not measured with a ruler.

Modest yet not stingy,
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The ancients nourished with virtue—
Modest yet not stingy, and the people submit.
*The *South Flower Sutra* says:
The ancients had the constant Way—
The round was not circumscribed with a compass.

Straight yet not domineering,
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
Without adding force,
Straight yet not domineering, and the people suffice in frugality.
*The *South Flower Sutra* says:
The ancients had the constant Way—
The crooked were not straightened with hooks,
The straight were not measured with cords.

Brilliant yet not dazzling.
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
Without displaying virtue,
Brilliant yet not dazzling, and the people remain pure and honest.
*The *South Flower Sutra* says:
The ancient sages did not ponder or premeditate,
They shone yet did not dazzle.

**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Governing Men and Serving Heaven**
This chapter of the *South Flower Sutra* speaks:
Though noble as the Son of Heaven, they did not use their nobility to domineer over others;
Though wealthy with all under heaven, they did not use their riches to mock others.
Rich and noble yet frugal—
This is truly virtue.
When the people are frugal, the state endures.

Governing men and serving Heaven,
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The ruler’s relation to the people is like the foundation to a city.
A thick foundation makes the city firm,
A wealthy people make the state prosperous.
None surpass frugality.
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The ancient sages governed with the Dao—
Frugality and modesty were seen as scarcity,
For seeing scarcity, they could achieve abundance,
Thus enduring long.

Only frugality,
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The ruler’s Way lies in frugality to preserve life—
This is called early cultivation of virtue.
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
Frugality prevents the people from hunger.
Early cultivation is called accumulating virtue—
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
Accumulating virtue makes kingship,
Accumulating stones makes mountains,
Accumulating water makes rivers.
Without accumulation, nothing is achieved.
Accumulating virtue without limit,
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The skilled ruler accumulates virtue,
And the people can be employed.
Without limit, none know its end,
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The ancient sages dared not indulge in extravagance,
Guarding frugality, thus enduring long.
None know its end—this is how one establishes a state.
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The ancient sages did not dare to be extravagant or arrogant,
Guarding frugality, thus enduring long.

The mother of a lasting state—
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The people are the root of a state.
Frugality is the foundation of humanity.
This is called deep-rooted and firmly anchored—
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The ruler’s possession of the people is like a tree’s possession of its roots.
The greater the tree, the deeper its roots and the firmer its trunk.
This is the Dao of enduring life and long reign.

*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The people are the root and foundation,
The state is the branches and leaves.
When the root and foundation are deep and robust,
The branches and leaves flourish and excel.

**Chapter Sixty: Governing Great States**
This chapter from *The South华经* speaks:
*My teacher!* *My teacher!*
He nourishes all things without excess,
His blessings extend to all ages without partiality,
His life surpasses the ancient sages without boasting of longevity,
He encompasses heaven and earth,
Molds myriad forms without artifice—
This is called *Heaven’s Harmony*.

The ancient sages who understood *Heaven’s Harmony*
Had no celestial grievance,
No human censure,
No burden from things,
No reproach from spirits.

The Dao does not harm the people,
And the world finds harmony and joy,
In accord with the people’s harmony.

Governing great states—
*The *South华经* says:
The ancient sages were clear in the virtue/power of heaven and earth’s non-action,
This is called the great lineage, the great root,
Rooted in the Dao,
In harmony with heaven.

In harmony with heaven—
This is called *Heaven’s Harmony*.
Thus, those who know *Heaven’s Harmony*
Have no celestial grievance.

If one cooks a small delicacy—
*The *South华经* says:
The sages’ non-action
Balances and harmonizes the world,
In accord with humanity—
This is called *The People’s Harmony*.
Thus, those who know *The People’s Harmony*
Have no human censure.

With the Dao to govern the world—
*The *South华经* says:
The ancient sages’ life was in accord with heaven’s movement,
Their death was in accord with nature’s transformation.
In stillness, they aligned with the yin’s virtue/power,
In motion, they rode the waves of the yang—
This is called *in harmony with heaven*.
*In harmony with heaven*—
This is called *Heaven’s Harmony*.
Thus, those who know *Heaven’s Harmony*
Have no burden from things.

Their spirits are not numinous—
*The *South华经* says:
The ancient sages—
In action, they were heaven,
In stillness, they were earth.
With a single, steadfast heart, they ruled the world,
Their spirits did not vex,
Their souls did not weary,
With a single, steadfast heart, all things submitted—
This is called *in accord with humanity*.
*In accord with humanity*—
This is called *The People’s Harmony*.
Thus, those who know *The People’s Harmony*
Have no reproach from spirits.

It is not that their spirits are not numinous—
*The *South华经* says:
The ancient sages spoke of emptiness and stillness,
Extending it to heaven and earth,
Permeating all things—
This is called *Heaven’s Harmony*,
*In harmony with heaven*.
Their numinous transformations did not harm the people—
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* [□ *Precision of Sincerity*] says:
The highest numinous transformations,
The people have no complaint.
Yet when numinous transformations have complaint—
It is not that their numinous transformations harm the people—
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The numinous transformations of the wordless Dao
Carry all without complaint,
Not harming the numinous nature of those who possess the Dao’s spirit.
The sages also do not harm the people.

*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The people are governed without action,
Action brings harm.
Governing without action—
The two do not harm each other,
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
Those who act
Cannot truly be without action,
Those who cannot be without action
Cannot truly act—
This harms the people.
Thus, virtue/power returns to its source.

*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The ancient sages who knew *Heaven’s Harmony*
With a single, steadfast heart
Nourished the world without action—
And the world found harmony and joy.

**Chapter Sixty-One: Great States as the Lowly Flow**
This chapter from *The Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* speaks:
In the Warring States era, the public lords and marquises treated a single state as their own,
Their *qi* was abundant yet their resolve was strong,
The powerful used arms to invade the weak,
The weak defied and undermined the strong,
Clinging to their weapons with rigid resolve,
Creating strife and fostering resentment,
For long they did not achieve harmony—
And the world fell into great disorder.

Thus, when states are bound in harmony and stillness,
And arms are laid down without contention,
The world attains great peace.

Great states are the lowly flow of the world—
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
Hence, the Dao does not triumph through rigid strength,
Nor does it gain through greedy competition.
Victory lies in the world’s spontaneous submission,
Gain lies in the world’s accord with you.
Softness and weakness bring victory,
Ren and righteousness bring gain.
The world’s receptive feminine—
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The ancient sages acted as the world’s receptive feminine,
Thus they could endure long.

The receptive feminine constantly triumphs through stillness over the masculine—
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The Dao of victory through arms
Awaits disorder with governance,
Awaits motion with stillness,
Awaits the masculine with the receptive feminine—
One must not act first.
Stillness is the lowly way—
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
Thus the sages grasp the feminine and receptive,
And so can establish their masculine and strong.
Advancing with the receptive feminine,
Their virtue/power and deeds do not decline—
This is the way of heaven.

Guard the Dao of stillness,
Restrain the feminine’s resolve,
With softness and weakness, find peace in stillness.
Thus, great states submit to small states and take them—
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
To govern with greatness over smallness,
This is called *altering humanity*.
Small states submit to great states and take them—
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
To offend with smallness against greatness,
This is called *defying heaven*.

Thus, sometimes one submits to take—
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The small and weak have the Dao,
They gain without contention.
Sometimes one submits and takes—
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The strong and great have the Dao,
They conquer without battle.

Great states seek only to nurture and embrace others—
*The *Vacuous and Pure Communiqué* says:
Small states I will cherish,
If they rely on arms and authority,
Their extinction is imminent.

Small states seek only to serve others—
*The *Vacuous and Pure Communiqué* says:
Great states I will serve—
This is the path to seeking peace.
Both find what they desire—
*The *South华经* says:

To renew the world, to disband armies and rest the soldiers,
to cherish and nourish all kin,
and to share in ancestral sacrifices—
this is the conduct of the Sage and worthy scholar,
and the longing of all under heaven.

Thus, the great should act as the humble.

*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The Sages of ancient times, who were lowly, modest, and pure,
saw what was beneath them.
By seeing what was beneath them, they could uphold their loftiness,
while the proud could not stand.
The Dao/Way is the deepest mystery of all things—**Chapter Sixty-Two**
This chapter of *The South华经* speaks: The governance of the ancient Sages
was always external before internal.
Without action, they were clear and tranquil,
they aligned themselves and then acted,
and firmly accomplished their tasks—
that was all.

Later generations of rulers
established laws and standards by which to judge others,
who dared not disobey and thus transform themselves—
this was to deceive virtue/power.

In governing the world,
it is like crossing the sea or digging rivers
and commanding mosquitoes to carry mountains—
laboring without gain,
not as good as the Three Sovereigns* following the Way of non-action,
which governs without labor.
Advancing the Dao/Way requires no labor.

The Dao/Way,
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
gives birth to all things,
rests in yin and yang,
transforms into the four seasons,
divides into the five phases,*
and each finds its place—
this is called the Dao/Way.
The deepest mystery of all things,
*The *South华经* says:
The Dao/Way is the source from which all things arise.

The treasure of the virtuous,
*The *South华经* says:
Moreover, the Dao/Way—
those who lose it perish,
those who act against it fail.
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
Nothing is easier under heaven than doing good.
What is called doing good
is to remain still and without action,
to follow one’s nature and discard excess,
to avoid all enticements and temptations,
to follow one’s nature and preserve truth,
to undergo no change within oneself—
thus, doing good is easy.

The safeguard of the unvirtuous,
*The *South华经* says:
Moreover, the Dao/Way—
those who lose it die,
those who act against it fail.
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
Nothing is harder under heaven than doing evil.
What is called doing evil
is to be turbulent, obscuring, and deceitful,
to be restless and greedy,
contrary to human nature—
thus, it is said that doing evil is hard.

Persuasive words can be sold,
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
First teach with the Dao/Way,
then guide with virtue/power,
to entice the good.
Noble conduct can elevate others.
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
If simple exhortation is not heeded,
then apply authority and punishment.
Why should the unvirtuous be abandoned?
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
With such strict warnings,
how could there be any unvirtuous?

Humans do not abandon humans,
things do not abandon things.
Thus, establishing the Son of Heaven,
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The ancients established the Son of Heaven
to uphold the Dao/Way of governing the world,
to return to the root of non-action,
and to transform through emptiness and tranquility.

The ancients did not establish emperors and kings
to indulge their desires,
nor did the Sages ascend the throne
to enjoy leisure at their ease.
They made the world’s people strong to protect the weak,
many to guard the few,
the cunning to deceive the simple,
the brave to overwhelm the timid—
yet they also did not teach the clever with their cleverness,
nor distribute wealth with their wealth.
Thus, the Son of Heaven was established to harmonize them.

Setting up the Three Ministers and Nine Officials,
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The wisdom of one person could not encompass all within the Four Seas,
so the Three Ministers and Nine Officials were appointed to assist and support them.

For isolated states and diverse customs that could not be reached by virtue/power,
the feudal lords were also established to teach and guide them.

Even with treasures of jade and rare tributes,
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
authority and influence are the chariots of the ruler.
Yu* was lean and emaciated,
Shun* was dark and withered,
Yu* had calloused hands and feet—
not that they desired wealth or craved position,
but they sought to awaken the world’s benefit
and remove the harm of all people.

From the Son of Heaven down to the common folk,
no one’s thoughts were burdened—
thus, there were none who sought sustenance without labor.

The leading four horses,
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
great ministers are the leading four horses of the ruler.
Yi Yin carried a cauldron to serve Tang*,
Lu Wang wielded an axe to enter Zhou*,
Bai Li Xi sold himself into slavery,
Guan Zhong was bound with ropes,
Mo Zi had no warm seat,
and Confucius had no heated席—
their bodies were not weary.
Thus, there were none who sought sustenance without labor.

Better to sit and advance this Dao/Way.
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The ancients of the Three Sovereigns*
taught without descending from their halls,
yet their transformations reached the Four Seas.
They spoke no words yet moved all under heaven,
altered customs and habits,
and people transformed and became virtuous—
as if they were born that way.
Criminal punishments were insufficient to change customs,
slaughter was insufficient to stop deceit—
only divine transformation is precious.

Why was this Dao/Way so esteemed in antiquity?
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The ancients, both ruler and subject,
engaged in few and simple matters above,
and followed easy and natural functions below—
ruler and subject did not weary of each other,
and this way endured for ages.
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Pure* says:
If the ruler clears his heart and reduces his tasks,
and the subjects revere and uphold their duties,
then Great Peace will naturally arise.

Not seeking daily to obtain,
*The *Communiqué on the Mysterious and Transcendent* says:
The ancients who were good at ruling
modeled themselves after the rivers and seas.
Rivers and seas act without effort,
yet can draw all streams to themselves.
They do not seek yet gain,
they do not act yet succeed—
the Dao/Way of heaven and earth,
complete without action,
obtained without seeking.

Does this mean crimes are pardoned?
*The *South华经* says:
In ancient times, the states that established virtue/power,
their people were simple and unrefined—
yet they governed themselves.
Thus, they were esteemed under heaven.
*The *South华经* says:
The ancients valued non-action,
non-action above,
and non-action below as well.
**Chapter Sixty-Three on Non-Action**

This chapter of *The South华经* speaks: In response to the Son of Heaven’s governance of non-action,
the House of You* did not compare to the House of Tai*.
The House of Tai* practiced non-action,
their sleep was slow and deep,
without dreams,
their waking was clear and bright,
without thought or deliberation.
Their wisdom was pure and trustworthy, not deceitful,
their virtue/power was thoroughly true, not false—
they had never yet allowed the Dao/Way to enter into inhumanity.

The House of You had action,
yet it still relied on reducing benevolence and righteousness to coerce the people’s hearts toward goodness—
yet it still gained the people’s deceit and falsehood,
and never truly cultivated a benevolent heart beyond humanity.

The ancient sages could practice the Dao/Way of non-action,
for non-action was not difficult—
non-action, *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Non-action is non-action—
*The South华经* says:
Adrift in non-action.

Non-action in affairs is non-action—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Non-action in affairs is knowing the unknown—
*The South华经* says:
Adrift in the business of non-affairs.

Non-action in taste is non-taste—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The ancients savored the Dao without abandoning it,
while modern men abandon the Dao without savoring it.

Great and small—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The Dao of Heaven and Earth,
greatness rooted in the small,
the Dao great in its completion through the small.
The ancient sages modeled Heaven’s non-action,
softness, weakness, subtlety, and mystery—
this was seeing the small.
Seeing the small, thus they could achieve the great.

Much and little—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The Dao of Heaven and Earth,
abundance rooted in scarcity,
the Dao abundant in its completion through the little.
The ancient sages modeled Heaven’s non-action,
governing the world with the Dao,
diminishing their brilliance—
this was seeing the little.
Seeing the little, thus they could achieve the beautiful.

Repaying resentment with virtue/power—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The thicker the giving, the finer the return,
the greater the resentment, the deeper the calamity.
Sparse giving with great expectations,
nurturing resentment without calamity—
this has never existed.

Observe how they proceed,
and you shall know how they arrived.

Planning difficulties in their ease—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The ancients used upright teachings,
easy and thus certain to succeed,
while later generations used perverse teachings,
difficult and thus certain to fail.

Doing greatness in their minutiae—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Some things are easy to do but difficult to complete,
others difficult to complete but easy to ruin.
Easy to do but difficult to complete—these are affairs.
Difficult to complete but easy to ruin—these are words.

The world’s difficult matters must begin in ease—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Men all know to discard the useless for the useful,
yet their daily lives are insufficient to complete the Dao.

The world’s great matters must begin in the small—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
On days of gambling and games, they inquire about the Dao,
yet their hearing and seeing are profound.

Easy yet not difficult,
small yet not great—
Thus the sages—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
They speak without being believed,
act without benevolence,
govern without order,
achieve without doing—
thus the heart of Heaven moves with sincere teaching,
the Three Sovereigns practiced non-action.
They never sought greatness,
and thus achieved the great.

*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The ancient wise rulers modeled the rivers and seas.
The rivers and seas practice non-action,
yet nothing is beyond their greatness—
all streams flow to them,
thus they achieve the great.

Light promises must be few in truth—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Speaking without truth,
acting without benevolence,
governing without order,
doing without achievement—
thus the superficial pretenders,
the Five Emperors and Three Kings did not sincerely adhere to the Dao.

Many easinesses bring many difficulties—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Later generations, lacking the roots of governance and teaching,
yet desiring to rule over the myriad people—
this is difficult.

Thus the sages—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Affairs are difficult to complete but easy to ruin,
words are difficult to establish but easy to abandon—
thus the sages focused their hearts on the Dao,
the enlightened saw uniquely in non-action.

Yet difficulties remain,
and thus they are ultimately without difficulty.

*Chapter Sixty-Four on Ease in Holding Firm*

*This chapter of The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* speaks:
The people of the end times indulge in perverse desires and lose their nature—
their movements are never upright.
Governance brings chaos,
self-cultivation brings falsehood.
Those who do not hear the Dao cannot return to rectitude,
those who do not understand virtue/power cannot achieve tranquility.

Human nature is originally without perversity,
yet prolonged indulgence in perversity
makes the easy seem easy and forgets its root—
thus they cling to perversity.
Water’s nature desires clarity,
yet sand and soil defile it;
human nature desires rectitude,
yet perverse speech harms it.

Knowing their own deceit is useless,
even the greedy will reject it,
yet not knowing their own desires are useless,
even the virtuous cannot relinquish them.

Thus men lose their states and die by others’ hands,
becoming the world’s laughter—
they have never failed to indulge their own desires,
thus those who act bring ruin,
those who grasp lose.

Knowing winter fans and summer furs are useless to them,
all things turn to dust and filth—
useless.

Thus it is said:
Non-action, hence no ruin,
non-grasping, hence no loss.

Its ease is easy to hold—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Wisdom discerning right and wrong
is the gateway to calamity and fortune.

Its unmanifested is easy to plan—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Movement and stillness, public and private—
the pivot of gain and harm.

Its fragile is easy to break—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Calamity’s arrival—
men themselves generate it;
fortune’s coming—
men themselves complete it.

Its subtle is easy to disperse—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Accumulating rectitude brings fortune,
accumulating perversity brings calamity.

Doing it before it arises—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Men all neglect minor harms,
easy trivial matters,
until great calamities arrive—
one must be cautious.

Later men know to respond to calamities after they arise,
yet do not know to be cautious in the subtle to prevent calamities from forming.
Preventing calamities from arising is easy,
yet applying remedies after calamities form is difficult.

Curing it before chaos—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The Dao is cautious in the small and subtle,
great calamities do not flourish.
Yet modern men do not strive to be cautious in the subtle to prevent calamities,
but instead wait for calamities to form before applying remedies—
even the divine cannot act.

Trace calamities and misfortunes to their origins—
ten thousandfold the Dao’s methods,
yet no fixed remedy exists.

A tree thick enough to embrace grows from a hair’s end;
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
A ten-foot girth begins with a handful,
from a hair’s end it grows gradually,
small things accumulate into great.

A nine-tiered terrace rises from a clod of earth;
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
A hundred-zhang tower begins below,
layered earth becomes a mountain,
subtle things accumulate into vastness.

A thousand-li journey starts beneath one’s feet.
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
A lame tortoise travels a thousand li,
one halting step at a time,
near things accumulate into far.

Those who pursue ruin themselves—
*The Scripture of the Cavern Spirit* says:
Those who love white things
consider blackness filth.

Those who love wealth excessively
do not see other things worth loving;
those who love perversity excessively
do not see the Dao’s worth.

Men of the latter age who die young
are not without arts—
their cunning is extreme,
yet the more they scheme, the shorter their lives.
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Those who love affairs never fail to meet ruin,
those who love perversity never fail to lose.
Each pursues what they love
only to harm themselves—
thus it is said: *those who act bring ruin upon themselves.*

Those who grasp lose.
*The Scripture of the Cavern Spirit* says:
Those who love black things
consider whiteness filth.

Those who love horses excessively
do not see other things worth loving;
those who love ghosts excessively
do not see the divine’s worth.

In the latter age, those whose spirits grow wrathful
are not without reverence for the gods—
their licentious rites prevail,
and the gods grow ever angrier.

*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The reason men lose their states,
die in disgrace,
and become objects of scorn for all under heaven,
is never without their love of desires—
thus it is said: *those who grasp lose.*

Therefore, the Sage of old, as *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says,
*"If the people of this age are perverse toward gods and spirits,
who can set them right?"*

Governance lies in the Dao, not in craft;
the gentleman cultivates upright qi,
the petty man cultivates perverse qi—
hence, the Sage acts without doing,
and so meets no ruin.
He does not grasp,
and so meets no loss.
Act without doing,
and so meet no ruin—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Those who delight in licentious rites,
heedless of future calamity,
are perverse qi—
thus it is said: *without doing, there is no ruin.*
Do not grasp,
and so meet no loss—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
In the latter age, those who cling to ghosts and gods,
heedless of future calamity,
are perverse qi—
thus it is said: *without grasping, there is no loss.*

The people’s undertakings
often falter just as they near completion.
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The origins of calamity and fortune are subtle and unseen;
the petty man does not know the gates of misfortune—
he stirs and falls into guilt,
unmindful of his subtle desires.
To be cautious at the end as at the beginning,
then there will be no ruined undertakings.
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious*—*Chapter of the Talisman*—says:
States fall from losing their governance,
filial piety wanes from lacking completion,
misfortune arises from grasping action,
illness stems from carelessness—
thus, to be cautious at the end as at the beginning,
there will be no ruined undertakings.

Therefore, the Sage, as *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says,
*"The Sage perceives their beginning and end—
it cannot be neglected."*

Desire not what should not be desired.
*The Scripture of the Southern Flower*—*The Zhuangzi*—says:
Ancient men desired,
but desired what they could not desire—
their desire reached the Dao itself.
They did not prize hard-to-obtain wealth;
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Ancient men did not prize hard-to-obtain wealth,
nor value useless things.

Study not what should not be studied.
*The Scripture of the Southern Flower*—*The Zhuangzi*—says:
Ancient scholars studied,
but studied what they could not study—
their study reached the Dao itself.

Return to the faults of the common people.
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
In ancient times, toward virtue,
they did not slight the small and so failed to practice it;
toward faults,
they did not overlook the subtle and so failed to correct them.
To aid the natural unfolding of all things,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Ancient Sages of old
were in nature aligned with the Dao—
they knew without study,
saw without looking,
heard without listening—
the natural Way itself.
Yet they did not dare to act.
*The Scripture of the Southern Flower*—*The Zhuangzi*—says:
In ancient times, above and below alike,
there was no doing.

*The Classic of the Dao and Virtue*—*Four Children’s Commentary on the Ancient Way*—Volume Eight concludes.
Volume Nine begins.

**Chapter Sixty-Five: Ancient Virtue in the Dao**

In the age of ancient great virtue and supreme Dao,
*The Southern Flower* speaks:
The Sage did not exalt the worthy,
nor employ the capable.
Above, like pruning branches,
the people were wild as deer.

Rectitude was natural—no need to call it *yi* (righteousness),
mutual love—no need to call it *ren* (benevolence),
sincerity—no need to call it *zhong* (loyalty),
truthfulness—no need to call it *xin* (faithfulness).
They moved clumsily yet guided one another—no need to call it a blessing.
Thus, they acted without leaving traces,
accomplished deeds without leaving records—
the people were simple and easy to govern.

Those ancient masters of the Dao—
*The Southern Flower* says:
The Sovereigns of the Mysterious Age
governed with *wuwei* (non-action),
merely embodying Heaven’s virtue.

Not to enlighten the people,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Supreme loyalty restored simplicity—
the people harbored no deceit or concealment.
Rather, they sought to befuddle them.

*The Southern Flower* says:
In the southern lands, there was a village
named *Jiàn Dé* (Established Virtue),
its people simple and unrefined—
thus, they were easy to govern.

The difficulty in governing the people—
*The Southern Flower* says:
Now, the Zhou promote cleverness, skill, and ornamental culture—
insufficient to stabilize the realm.
The people are difficult to govern
because their intelligence is excessive.

*The Southern Flower* says:
If the ruler sincerely favors cleverness yet lacks the Dao,
the world falls into great disorder.
Thus, Jie and Zhou each brought chaos—
their crime lay in their love of cleverness.
Now, the people are difficult to govern
because their intelligence is excessive.

Thus, governing with cleverness is the ruin of the state.
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Those who govern with cleverness
rely on one man’s talent—
hard to sustain the state.
If they favor clever stratagems,
they breed deceit and corruption—
the winds that destroy nations.
Thus, governing with cleverness is the ruin of the state.
Not governing with cleverness is the state’s blessing.

*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious [Original Dao]* says:
Ancients did not govern with cleverness—
the state’s blessing.

To know these two truths—
*The Southern Flower* says:
Abandon petty cleverness, and great wisdom shines forth.
This is the model.

*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Those who govern with literary cleverness
labor in vain with weary hearts.
Relying solely on cleverness,
failures multiply.
To love cleverness is to exhaust artifice—
cleverness breeds calamity.
To counter cleverness with cleverness
is like stirring water to seek clarity—
difficult indeed.

Those who know the root of governance
abandon artifice and cleverness,
letting *wuwei* transform naturally.
Always hold to the model—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Now, if one seeks to learn the Dao
without attaining the pure, luminous, and sacred,
merely clinging to texts,
they cannot govern at all.
This is called *xuán dé* (Mysterious Virtue).

*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Ancient Sages held *xuán dé* in their hearts,
and their transformations moved like spirits.
Only those who harmonize with the Great Unity
and naturally respond can govern—
this is called *xuán dé*.
Mysterious Virtue is profound and vast—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious [Natural Dao]* says:
Ancient Sages preserved themselves with Heaven and Earth,
upright in cultivating the Dao.
The deeper the human path, the deeper the virtue;
the deeper the virtue, the more complete the achievements—
this is called *xuán dé*, profound and vast.
They inverted with things—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Their inversion with things was complete.

The Commentary says:
*"Long处* (prolonged) yet not *zhì* (wise/knowing), hence it is called *fǎn* (inversion).
Then it reaches *Dà Shùn* (Great Harmony).

*The Scripture of the South (Zhuangzi)* says:
When harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, their unity is seamless,
like the simplicity of the foolish and the dimness of the ignorant—
this is called *Mysterious Virtue*, in accord with *Great Harmony*.

**Chapter 66: The King of All Valleys (Jiānghǎi as King)**
This chapter of *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* states:
In the ancient times, the Sage-Kings governed through the Dao/Way,
retiring yet without absence, modeling themselves after the rivers and seas—
not claiming greatness for themselves, their virtue naturally manifesting,
so they could establish their kingship.

Human nature and disposition
submit to virtue, not to force.
Virtue lies in yielding, not in contention—
thus the ancient Sage-Kings,
who wished to be honored by others, first honored others themselves;
who wished to be revered by others, first revered others;
who wished to overcome others, first made themselves weak;
who wished to be humble before others, first humbled themselves.

Thus high and low, reverence and humility,
the Dao/Way governs them—
speaking gently to others while placing themselves last,
so the world finds joy in promoting them without weariness,
and in bearing them without resentment—
this is virtue abundant and *qi* in harmony.

Thus knowing to yield is to take,
and to retreat is to lead—
this is near to the Dao/Way.

Virtue bestowed upon the world,
preserved through yielding,
was how the ancient Kings maintained the world—
thus they could endure long.
This is the virtue of the Sea yielding kingship.

**Why the rivers and seas can be kings of all valleys,**
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious [Natural Virtue/Compendium]* says:
The rivers and seas are low and humble,
yet all streams flow into them—
thus they achieve vastness.
Because they excel in yielding,
they can be kings of all valleys.

*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The rivers and seas yield because they are low,
the Heavenly Pool is the *Yuān Dé* (Abyssal Virtue),
and fish and turtles gather there.
Thus the sea does not contend with the eastward flow—
this is the utmost greatness.

Therefore, the Sage-Kings
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The rivers and seas occupy the Earth’s deficiencies,
so the world submits to and venerates them.
The Sage-Kings who practice humility, modesty, and yielding words—
this is seen as yielding.
Seen as yielding, thus they attain their loftiness;
the arrogant cannot stand.

*The Scripture of the South (Zhuangzi)* says:
Once upon a time, Yao and Shun yielded yet became emperors,
Tang and Wu contended yet became kings,
and the Duke of Bai contended yet perished.
To ascend over others, one must speak gently to them,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious [Virtue/Compendium]* says:
To ascend over others,
one must necessarily speak gently to them.
The world must imitate their joy and love,
all must promote and yield.

To lead others, one must place oneself last,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
To lead others,
one must necessarily place oneself last.
The world advances their benevolence and righteousness,
and there is no harsh *qi*.
Thus, though they occupy the highest position, others do not resent them,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious [Dao/Way Origins]* says:
Thus, though they occupy the highest position, others do not resent them,
and though they stand foremost, others do not harm them—
the world submits to them, and the wicked fear them.
Though they stand foremost, others do not harm them.
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
To occupy the highest position while the people do not resent,
and to stand foremost while others do not harm—
even in distant lands and alien customs,
where maggots fly and worms writhe,
all are drawn to love them.
Thus the world finds joy in promoting them without weariness.
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Thus the world finds joy in promoting them without weariness,
without them, nothing is left undone,
without their leading, nothing fails to succeed—
hence they are held in highest esteem by the world.
Because they do not contend,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious [Natural Virtue]* says:
The ancient skilled in ruling modeled themselves after the rivers and seas—
low and yielding, not contending.
All streams flow into them,
so none can contend with them.
Thus the Dao/Way does not stand upon strength and arms,
but upon the world’s promotion of them—
not upon their own seizing.
Because they do not contend,
none can contend with them.
Thus the world cannot contend with them.
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The Way of ordinary people is many and does not unite,
the Way of the Sage-Kings is humble yet none can surpass it.
Because they do not contend with all things,
the world cannot contend with them.

**The World All Praises (Chapter 67)**
This chapter of *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* states:
The Dao/Way is simple yet expansive,
mysterious yet luminous,
soft yet strong—
containing yin and emitting yang,
and thus manifesting the three brilliances.

The sun and moon move through it,
mountains rise through it,
the abyss deepens through it,
birds fly through it,
beasts run through it,
the qilin roams through it,
and the phoenix soars through it.

To take reverence through humility,
to take survival through extinction,
to take precedence through retreat.

The first is *cí* (compassion),
the second is *jiǎn* (frugality),
the third is not daring to lead the world.

The ancient Sage-Kings preserved softness and did not grow rigid,
retired yet were not absent,
did not dare to be proud or extravagant—
their virtue naturally transformed,
so they could establish their kingship.
They could endure long,
and their three treasures were vast and expansive.

The world all praises my Dao/Way as great,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
My Dao/Way is *wu wéi* (non-action),
and I do not privately receive what is unworthy.
It seems not to conform.
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
My virtue contains simplicity,
yet it tolerates the unworthy.
Only because it is great,
does it seem not to conform.
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The ancient skilled in ruling modeled themselves after the rivers and seas—
*wu wéi* (non-action), occupying unworthy positions,
so they became kings of the world.
If conformity were long sustained,
its subtlety would be lost.
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The ancient Sage-Kings were clear-sighted, wise, and benevolent,
yet they preserved themselves in simplicity,
practicing non-action while the world was governed.
I possess three treasures,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
My Dao/Way has three treasures—
to take reverence through humility,
to take vastness through frugality,
to take precedence through retreat.
Preserving and holding them.
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The Dao/Way is preserved through them.

The first is compassion,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,
great yet rooted in the small,
humble yet self-guarding.

The second is frugality,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,
abundant yet beginning with the few,
frugal yet self-fortifying.

The third is not daring to lead the world,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,
leading through retreat as its principle,
retiring to yield.

Thus, compassion brings forth courage—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The ancient sages followed the Dao’s humility,
so as to place themselves below others.
Humility yields honor—
this is the fulfillment of Heaven’s Way.

Frugality brings forth vastness—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The ancient sages followed the Dao’s frugality,
so as to begin with little.
Frugality yields abundance—
this is the fulfillment of Heaven’s Way.

Not daring to lead the world,
thus one attains the completion of great instruments and long reigns—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The ancient sages followed the Dao’s retreat,
so as to place themselves behind others.
Retreat yields precedence—
this is the fulfillment of Heaven’s Way.

Now, abandoning compassion and courage—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Men of the latter age love strength and hate weakness,
yet they do not know their loss—
the overbearing perish.

Abandoning frugality and vastness—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Men of the latter age love extravagance and hate frugality,
yet they do not know their loss—
the proud and wasteful perish.

Abandoning retreat and precedence—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Men of the latter age love to lead and hate to follow,
yet they do not know their loss—
those who contend for precedence are undone.
Death is near—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The root of reckless strength lies in humility and weakness;
the root of vast utility lies in frugality and restraint;
the root of striving for precedence lies in modesty and retreat.
When these three are lost, states perish and fall.

Compassion—
in war, it brings victory—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The Dao does not conquer through strength,
but through the world’s spontaneous submission,
not through self-assertion.
Softness and weakness prevail.

In defense, it makes firm—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
High walls and deep moats are insufficient for true defense.
The skillful guardian needs no walls.
Heaven will protect it—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Heaven’s Way diminishes the full and benefits the few.
*The Scripture of the Cavern Spirit* says:
When virtue and Dao flourish, spirits and gods assist—
this is the mark of the virtuous.

Compassion guards it—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
In times of order, righteousness guards the body;
in times of chaos, the body guards righteousness.

**Chapter Sixty-Eight: The Virtuous Warrior**
This chapter from *The South Flower Scripture* recounts:
Wei Wu Hou asked Xu Wu Gui:
*"I wish to love the people and practice righteousness while laying down arms—is this possible?"*
Xu Wu Gui replied:
*"Your armies stand like cranes at the ornate gate,
your formations do not rely on swift horses at the hallowed hall—
how can this be called laying down arms?
In ancient times, there was no storing of weapons for gain,
no outwitting others through cleverness,
no defeating others through schemes,
no conquering others through war.
Now, those who slaughter the people and seize their lands,
to nourish their own harmony and spirits—
who among them knows the art of war?
Where lies victory?
If you cannot cease, then cultivate sincerity within your breast,
responding to Heaven and Earth’s effortless nature without resistance.
When the people die, they are already freed—
what use is there in laying down arms?
The ancient virtuous warriors were not martial,
the skilled fighters did not rage.
Using the worthy without contention,
the world attains great peace.

The virtuous warrior is not martial—
*The Scripture of the Cavern Spirit* says:
Armor and weapons are insufficient for strength.

The skilled fighter does not rage—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The ancient masters of war stored their anger;
when anger was stored, their威 *wei* could be established.

The one who bests enemies does not contend—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The skilled warrior fights no one,
but rides the currents of time and follows the people’s desires—
and the world submits.

The master of men serves below—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The ancient masters of men were like the many feet of a centipede,
each aiding without harming,
or like the tongue and teeth—
firm and yielding, grinding without destruction.

Though the summer jade may have flaws,
and the moon’s pearl may bear blemishes,
yet the world treasures them—
the worthy do not let minor faults obscure great beauty.
To fixate on others’ shortcomings,
forgetting their virtues,
and yet seek the worthy in the world—
this is difficult indeed.

This is called the virtue of non-contention—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Those who win the hearts of men must first win themselves;
those who win themselves must be soft and weak.
Those who achieve hegemony and kingship must first be conquerors;
those who conquer must be virtuous.

This is called the power of using men—
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
To love the worthy is benevolence;
to respect the worthy is ritual.

This is called aligning with Heaven—
the ancient ultimate.

*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
A thousand-chariot state practicing cultural virtue becomes king;
a ten-thousand-chariot state fond of war perishes.

**Chapter Sixty-Nine: The Five Kinds of War**
This chapter from *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
There are five kinds of war:
There is the righteous war,
there is the responsive war,
there is the wrathful war,
there is the greedy war,
and there is the arrogant war.

To punish tyranny and rescue the weak—this is the righteous war.
When an enemy attacks and there is no alternative—this is the responsive war.
To quarrel over trifles, unable to master one’s own heart—this is the wrathful war.
To covet another’s land, to desire another’s wealth—this is the greedy war.
To boast of one’s state’s grandeur and people’s multitude,
and to seek superiority over enemy states—this is the arrogant war.

The righteous war brings kingship,
the responsive war brings victory,
the wrathful war brings defeat,
the greedy war brings death,
the arrogant war brings annihilation—
this is Heaven’s Way.

Now, the warring states’ rebellious ministers and traitors
use war lightly against enemies,
ambush the unprepared,
and first invite disaster—
no calamity is greater than underestimating the enemy.

There is a saying about war:
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious [Upper Section on Rites]* says:
To use the unusual in war,
the unusual becomes weary as if labored,
the unusual becomes hungry as if starved,
the unusual becomes restless as if disturbed,
the unusual becomes chaotic as if disordered,
the unusual becomes forward as if retreating.
Where does one go without victory?
The latter prevails.

I dare not act as master.

*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The one who strikes first is on the path to exhaustion.

Yet as a guest, *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The one who moves last is the source of establishment.

I dare not advance even an inch,
but retreat a foot.

*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
To bend an inch to extend a foot—this is the way of the virtuous.

This is called "action without action,"
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Raising an army for others brings their aid;
raising an army for oneself brings their departure.

There is no arm to ward off,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Where the multitude aids, though weak, it must grow strong.

There is no enemy to oppose,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Where the multitude departs, though great, it must stand firm.

There is no weapon to grasp.
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The ancients held victory and triumph in not waging war while yet disbanding armies—when lords and vassals were in submission, this was the highest use of war.

No calamity is greater than underestimating the enemy,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The bold and courageous die by their reckless strength;
the eloquent and clever are constrained by their own cleverness.
One who knows victory through cleverness is capable;
one who does not know defeat through cleverness is not.

Brave in one act, discerning in one word,
one may be persuaded by subtle arguments,
but not yet trusted to broad application.

Lightly underestimating the enemy almost loses one’s treasure.

*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious • Upper Virtue Section* says:
Laozi observed shadows to know the principle of yielding last—
the one who moves last never fails in propriety.

Hence the Sage says:
"Do not follow convention;
always yield last and never strike first.
Like stacking firewood,
the last is the highest.

Thus when armies clash,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
If one hears that a sovereign of an enemy state is oppressing his people with cruelty,
he should raise his army and approach its borders.
When the enemy is ready to engage and meet in battle,
the one who yields last will prevail.
The compassionate will prevail."

*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The so-called "one who yields last"
is the Sage who guards the Dao of stillness,
restrains the feminine principle,
follows convention while responding to change,
always yields last and never strikes first—
his great achievements are without rigidity,
and he cannot be contested.
The one who yields last will prevail.

My words are found in *The Chapter of Easy Knowing*, the seventy-first chapter.
This chapter of *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* states:
The商太宰 saw Confucius and said:
"Is Master Kong a Sage?"
Confucius replied:
"A Sage? How dare I claim such a title! Yet I am one who studies widely and knows much."

The商太宰 said:
"Are the Three Kings Sages?"
Confucius replied:
"The Three Kings were skilled in employing those of wisdom and courage—
whether they were Sages, I do not know."

The商太宰 said:
"Are the Five Emperors Sages?"
Confucius replied:
"The Five Emperors were skilled in employing those of virtue and righteousness—
whether they were Sages, I do not know."

The商太宰 said:
"Are the Three Sovereigns Sages?"
Confucius replied:
"The Three Sovereigns were skilled in adapting to the times—
whether they were Sages, I do not know."

The商太宰 was greatly startled and said:
"Then who is truly a Sage?"
Confucius, moved in expression, replied:
"In the Western Zhou, there was the Grand Historian Lao Dan, who may be called a Sage—
without governing yet without chaos,
without speaking yet self-assured,
without transforming yet self-directed,
he drifts among the people who cannot name him.
He may be called a great Sage indeed."

Hence the Old Sage said:
"My words speak of the Great Dao,
the transformation of non-action."

My words,
*The Southern Flower Canon* says:
"Lao Dan was clear about the virtue/power of Heaven and Earth,
their non-action, and their simplicity—
this is called the Great Ancestor, the Great Root,
the Great Master."

Easy to know,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
To govern a great state, the Dao cannot be slighted.
When the land is vast, the measures cannot be narrow.
When the king’s position is exalted, the affairs cannot be burdensome.
When the people are many, the teachings cannot be harsh.
Burdensome affairs are difficult to govern,
harsh laws are difficult to enforce,
scant resources are hard to sustain—
this is where cleverness may be of little use,
and subtle arguments cannot bring order.

Hence what is not beneficial to governance,
what is beneficial yet causes disorder—
the Sage does not do this.

What is not beneficial to war,
what is beneficial yet causes waste—
the wise do not employ this.

Thus, achievements are not weary of being frugal,
affairs are not weary of being simplified,
demands are not weary of being few.
Frugal achievements are easy to complete,
simplified affairs are easy to govern,
few demands are easy to sustain—
this is easy to practice.

*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The River flows with winding ease, hence it can reach far;
The Mountain rises with gradual ascent, hence it can stand high;
The Dao proceeds with gentle leisure, hence it can transform.

He who is skilled in one technique,
proficient in one matter,
discerning in one ability—
may be persuaded by subtle arguments,
but cannot yet be broadly applied to governance.

The words of the Dao say:
Vague and indistinct,
it harmonizes with Heaven’s qi.
He who harmonizes with qi becomes an Emperor,
he who harmonizes with virtue becomes a King,
he who harmonizes with power becomes a Conqueror,
he who lacks any of these will perish.

Thus, without words yet governance is achieved,
without affairs yet transformation is complete—
this is why the heart of Heaven moves and transforms through non-action.

Hence, with the Dao to govern,
few affairs suffice for governance;
without the Dao to govern,
many affairs suffice only to bring disorder.

In the end times,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
The people of the world are overly constrained by petty pleasures
and obstructed by the Great Dao,
unable to know or practice it.
None can know,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
In the end times, petty learning obscures virtue,
and none can know it.

*The Southern Flower Canon* says:
In ancient times, virtue was not slighted by petty knowledge;
in later times, petty knowledge injured virtue,
and none could know it.

None can practice.
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
In the end times, petty goodness blocks the Dao,
and none can practice it.

*The Southern Flower Canon* says:
In ancient times, the Dao was not slighted by petty practice;
in later times, petty practice injured the Dao,
and none could practice it.

Words have a root,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* [• *Clarifying the Mysterious Section*] says:
Words have a root,
affairs have a master—
the highest words transcend words.
Affairs have a master,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* [• *Sincere Integrity Section*] says:
Words have a root,
affairs have a foundation—
the highest practice transcends practice.

He who lacks knowledge alone,
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
In the end times, petty learning—
those who vie for fish are drenched,
those who chase beasts are exhausted,
the shallow concerns of the vulgar—
these are the ends of things.
He who lacks knowledge alone."

Thus, none truly know me.
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
In the end times, petty Dao is abandoned,
its root and foundation lost.
Though skills may be many,
they are shallow, muddled, and dry—
better to speak little.
To harm the multitude by burdening them with tasks
and then sever their fingers to demonstrate
that great skill cannot be forced—
thus, none truly know me.

Few know me,
*The Scripture of the Void and Emptiness* says:
In the Western Zhou, the Grand Historian Lao Dan was a sage—
he ruled without governing, spoke without persuading,
transformed without teaching,
and drifted effortlessly, beyond the people’s naming.
Truly, he was a great sage.

Those who follow me are honored.
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
In silent repose, in profound stillness,
governing through non-action,
unaware of doing yet deeds accomplished—
this is the sage.
What is honored in the Dao is its dragon-like transformation,
for divine transformation alone is noble.

Thus, the sage,
*The Scripture of the South* says:
Does not stray from the root—
this is the Heavenly Human.
Taking Heaven as root,
virtue as foundation,
the Dao as gate,
manifesting in transformation—
this is the sage.
Clad in coarse robes yet holding jade.

*The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious* says:
Jade in the mountains makes grasses flourish,
pearls in the depths keep shores from withering,
the Dao within brings form to self-regulation.

**Chapter 71: "Knowing the Unknown"**
This chapter of *The True Scripture of the South* speaks:
The Dao does not desire mixture.
Scholars of many schools abound;
many, they disturb;
disturbed, they are disordered;
disorder brings sorrow and calamity.
Sorrowed, they cannot be saved.

Their books teach the virtuous:
to level instruction, to rectify lawsuits.
The worthy govern, the capable serve—
benevolence spreads below, and the people cherish virtue.
But when it decays,
cliques form, each promoting their own,
abandoning the public for private gain,
inner and outer factions rise,
the deceitful take office, the worthy hide away.

In ancient times, the Dao and virtue were obscured
in the books of the Hundred Schools.
The Confucians—Hui Shi and Du Shi—
their writings filled five chariots,
their teachings contradictory and tangled,
their words chaotic and useless.
The Mohists—Mo Di and Jin Hui—
did not align with the ancient kings,
abolishing the rites and music of old,
Mo Zi extolling Yu’s Way,
forcing his followers into laborious toil.

The Logicians—Sun Pin and Yin Wen—
crafted the *Hua Mountain Cap* to display themselves,
claiming it benefited nothing in the world.
The Legalists—Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao—
their teachings did not suit the living,
but only the logic of the dead.
The Sophists—Gongsun Long and his disciples—
could persuade with words but not with truth,
all teaching cleverness and deceit,
indulging in perverse and licentious ways,
then abandoning them to law, following with punishment.
Though they ravaged the world, they could not curb their treachery.

Skill alone is perilous,
and when lost, it multiplies.
To love knowledge and exhaust technique—
to govern with knowledge is to ruin the state.

Mountains yield gold, stones yield jade,
yet they erode each other;
trees breed worms, which devour them;
humans study, yet only bring chaos.
The more the ruler studies, the more the people labor;
the more the ruler acts, the more the people are troubled.

Thus, to stop the boiling with firewood only makes the boiling worse—
one who knows the principle of *wuwei* governance knows to remove the fire alone.
*Wuwei* naturally aligns itself.

Now, the teachings of the various schools—perverse doctrines and deceitful words—
are the very obstructions that bring chaos to the world.

To know what one does not know—
the *Tongxuan Jing*[*Symptoms of the Mysterious*] says:
*"The ancient sages who skillfully employed the Dao
let *wuwei* transform itself naturally,
and thus never caused harm.
Therefore it is said: To know what one does not know—*shàng* [superior]."*

To not know what one knows—
the *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Now, those who do not know the Dao
actively interfere, bringing self-ruin.
Fortune becomes misfortune.
Therefore it is said: To not know what one knows—*disease*."*

Only the diseased who recognize their disease—
the *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The common people and lesser scholars all indulge in book-learning for profit,
profiting from learning while unaware that their disease is their disease."*

Thus, they are not truly diseased—
the *Nanhua Jing*[*Southern Flower Sutra*] says:
*"Nan Rong Zhi said: When a villager falls ill,
and others ask about it, the sick person can name their ailment—
how could they not be ill?
The Sage is not ill,
yet those who recognize their disease—
even they are not truly ill.
For by recognizing their disease,
the *Nanhua Jing* says:
as if Zhi had drunk medicine to worsen his illness—
they can remove the disease of being diseased,
and thus are not ill.
Therefore, they are not ill."*

The *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Only the ancient sages knew that the disease of disease is no disease.
The people do not fear coercive laws—
this chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* says:
The ancient sages governed with the Dao,
maintaining softness without force,
allowing virtue to transform naturally,
and thus achieved their kingship.
Human nature responds to virtue, not to force.
Virtue comes from within—
self-love enables nobility,
and love for the people brings kingship,
so all under heaven return.
When the people do not fear coercion,
true awe naturally arises.
The *Chongxu Jing*[*Sutra of the Void*] says:
Yet to desire others to revere you—
this is impossible to attain through the Dao.
If others do not revere you,
how can danger or humiliation reach you?

Do not narrow your dwelling—
the *Nanhua Jing* says:
The enclosures of the Weishi clan,
the hunting grounds of the Yellow Emperor,
the palaces of Tang and Yu,
the halls of Tang and Wu—
as virtue declines, their dwellings grow ever narrower.

Do not exhaust what sustains you—
the *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"To govern a great state, the Dao must not be constrained.
The broader the land, the broader the governance must be.
An emperor who cannot win the people cannot achieve the world;
one who wins the people but loses the Dao cannot retain it.
Only the unbounded remains unbounded."
The *Chongxu Jing* says:
*"Laws and measures are within oneself;
examination lies with the people.
If the people love me, I must love them in return;
if the people hate me, I must hate them in return.
Thus, the Sage—
the *Chongxu Jing* says:
Tang and Wu loved the world, so they ruled;
Jie and Zhou hated the world, so they perished.

Self-knowledge—
the *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"The foundation of winning the people lies in self-knowledge.
When one blames others for their faults,
does one truly know oneself?
Not seeing oneself—
the *Tongxuan Jing* says:
Thus, the Sage does not force,
and so achieves kingship.
Self-love—
the *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"No virtue surpasses loving others;
to love others is to have no grievance with punishment."
Not esteeming oneself—
the *Tongxuan Jing* says:
*"Thus, the Sage loves themselves,
and so achieves nobility.
Therefore, abandon that and take this.
Heaven’s calamities do not arise—
those who attain this are blessed.
Forgotten is that,
and guilt departs while fortune arrives."*

「**Chapter 73: The Bold in Daring Bring Death**
This chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* speaks of: Seven states waging war, slaying the innocent, nourishing the unrighteous, and causing harm beyond measure. Indulging one’s private desires while ignoring the calamities within the realm—this is what Heaven detests, and what the people resent, and what Heaven punishes. Thus, the bold in daring bring death; what Heaven abhors, who knows its reason?

The Heavenly Net is vast and far-reaching, yet it does not fail to ensnare. The bold in daring bring death, but the *Tongxuan Jing˙Dao De* says: In the latter days of the Warring States, men have hearts of profit and loss, and from the outset, they harbor murderous intent. Thus, the bold in daring bring death, while the bold in restraint bring life.

The *Chongxu Jing* says: Those who practice the Dao make others so that though they be bold enough to strike, the strike will not take hold; though they be clever enough to attack, the attack will not find its mark. Though they strike and do not take hold, though they attack and do not find their mark, yet they still bring shame—how much less so than the ancient Sages, who made others so that though they be bold, they dare not strike, and though they be clever, they dare not attack! Those who dare not strike are not without murderous intent, but how much less so than the Sages, who from the outset have no murderous intent at all! Those who have no murderous intent at all have not yet cultivated a heart of love and benefit. Thus, they make all men and women under Heaven—without exception—rejoice and willingly embrace love and benefit, yet they dare not kill. If such is the case, without murderous intent, there is no place where they are not rulers, no office where they are not leaders. All under Heaven willingly embrace peace and benefit, and so the bold in restraint bring life.

Understanding these two principles—one brings benefit, the other harm. The *Tongxuan Jing* says: To love daring is the Dao of peril and ruin; the bold and daring die by force and tyranny. What Heaven abhors, who knows its reason? The *Chongxu Jing* says: Laozi spoke to Guan Yin: *"What Heaven abhors, who knows its reason?"* Therefore, even the Sage finds it difficult.

Under Heaven, nothing is easier than doing good; what is meant by doing good is to remain still and take no action, and so doing good is easy. Under Heaven, nothing is harder than doing evil; what is meant by doing evil is usurpation and regicide, deceit and falsehood, which go against human nature, and so doing evil is hard. The Dao of Heaven, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: Heaven’s Dao diminishes the full and benefits the few; the Dao of ghosts and spirits is proud and overflowing, not to be shared.

Without contention yet achieving victory, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: Those with hidden virtue must have manifest reward; those with secret deeds must have clear response. The sower of millet does not reap grain; the planter of evil does not receive virtue in return. Without speech yet responding well, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: To do evil in the light of day, men may punish you; to do evil in darkness, ghosts may punish you.

Without summoning yet they come, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven is the sun of winter and the shade of summer; all things return to it, yet none compel them. It reaches the utmost of natural and refined influence—coming without summoning, departing without being driven away. Thus, it is effortless yet good at planning.

The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Heaven’s Dao is broad and open; to abandon the self is not far. If one turns toward good, even if they err, there will be no resentment. If one does not turn toward good, even if they are loyal, they will bring misfortune. The Heavenly Net is vast and far-reaching, and the *Dongling Jing* says: *"If the prohibitive nets are sparse and wide, they are easy to evade yet hard to violate."* The Heavenly Net is vast and far-reaching, sparse yet never failing. Sparse yet never failing. The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In the Warring States, those who dare to fight kill the innocent; the people resent them, and Heaven punishes them.

**Chapter 74: The People Do Not Normally Fear Death**
This chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* speaks of: The Five Hegemons suddenly speaking of punishments and rewards, yet how can they govern the people? This is merely knowing the tools of governance, not the essential Dao of governance. One may use the tools of governance throughout the realm, but this is not enough to apply the Dao of governance throughout the realm.

The laws of the latter days set high standards yet fail to reach the guilty; impose heavy burdens yet punishments do not overcome them; create great difficulties yet executions are not dared. The people are burdened by these three evils, adorned with cleverness and deceiving their superiors, committing wickedness and courting danger. Even with harsh laws and severe punishments, they cannot suppress their deceit.

Wild beasts when cornered will strike; birds when cornered will peck; men when cornered will deceive—this is what is meant. Thus, the Five Hegemons’ harsh laws and severe punishments make the people crafty, and the rulers demand much while the people resent much. The more they demand, the less they receive; the more they prohibit, the fewer they overcome.

And so, to stop the boiling by adding more fire—though it seems a strange remedy—the *Tongxuan Jing* says: The essential principle of governance is to remove the fire itself. To be clear and still, to return to rectitude.

Thus, the Five Hegemons cruelly punish, taking the guilty into their own hands and killing them. Those who substitute for the officials in killing are rare indeed who do not soil their hands. The people do not normally fear death, and the *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Five Hegemons’ harsh laws and severe punishments are not enough to instill awe; killing the innocent is not enough to suppress deceit. How can you rely on death to instill fear?

The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Those who carve laws and impose executions are not the work of an Emperor or King; those who frequently use rods and whips are not the measures of one who seeks the distant. If you wish to make the people fear death, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Five Hegemons’ harsh laws and severe punishments make the people crafty; the more the rulers demand, the more the people contend below. The more they demand, the less they receive; the more they prohibit, the fewer they overcome.

And yet, there are those who are strange, the *Tongxuan Jing□Xia De* says: The people of the latter days adorn themselves with cleverness and deceive their superiors, commit wickedness and court danger. Even with harsh laws and severe punishments, they cannot suppress their deceit. Wild beasts when cornered will strike; birds when cornered will peck; men when cornered will deceive—this is what is meant.

I seize them and kill them, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: Ancient rulers who governed well accumulated their virtue; accumulating virtue, the people could be transformed. Today’s rulers who govern by cruelty and violence breed chaos, and chaos is the wind of ruined states. Who dares?」

The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The laws of the ancient kings were not their own creation.
With laws broad and punishments lenient, the prisons stand empty, and the realm unified in custom—none harbor deceitful hearts. This is the benevolence of the Sage.

Let those who hold office kill when they must. The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times, officials were appointed to restrain the people, lest they act without restraint. The establishment of rulers was to control these officials, lest they act unilaterally. Laws, measures, and Daoist arts were to restrain the ruler, lest he act arbitrarily.

To take the place of the executioner and kill—this is called usurping the Master Carpenter’s axe.

The *Tongxuan Jing* [in the *Shangren* section] says: A whale cast upon dry land is dominated by an ant. When a ruler abandons his proper role and contests matters with his ministers, he is dominated by his officials. Ministers hoard their wisdom and do not employ it, yet instead usurp authority from above.

If a ruler does not entrust capable men but insists on acting himself, his wisdom grows ever more constrained while his burdens increase. When cornered by his subordinates, he cannot rectify matters. His wisdom proves insufficient for governance, his authority inadequate for enforcing law—thus he cannot engage with the realm.

To take the place of the executioner and kill—this is called usurping the Master Carpenter’s axe. And he who usurps the Master Carpenter’s axe will rarely escape unscathed.

The *Tongxuan Jing* says: When a ruler’s joys and angers manifest in his heart, and his desires are visible without, those who guard their posts abandon principle to curry favor, and officials pervert the law to follow the wind. Rewards fail to match merit, punishments fail to fit crimes—thus superior and subordinate grow estranged, ruler and minister harbor grudges, officials grow chaotic, and wisdom cannot resolve slander while clarity cannot illuminate one’s own faults. Instead, they blame themselves, and so the sovereign grows ever more weary while his ministers grow ever more insolent.

Thus, he who usurps the Master Carpenter’s axe will rarely escape unscathed.

**On the People’s Hunger (Chapter 75)**
This chapter of the *Nanhua Jing* states: When learning is prized for cleverness but lacks the Dao, the world falls into chaos. How do we know this is so?

When the cunning of bows, crossbows, snares, and mechanical traps abounds, the birds grow disordered above. When the cunning of hooks, baits, nets, and weirs abounds, the fish grow disordered in the waters. When the cunning of traps, snares, and pitfalls abounds, the beasts grow disordered in the marshes. When the cunning of deceit, poison, sophistry, and debates over *jiehua* (contradictions), *jianhua* (subtleties), *firmness*, *whiteness*, *freshness*, *filth*, and distinctions abounds, then customs grow disordered in argumentation.

From ancient times to today, tyrants like Jie and Zhou have repeatedly plunged the world into great chaos, and the fault lies in their love of cleverness. Now, the people of Zhou are skilled yet difficult to govern, and so this chapter is composed.

**On the People’s Hunger**
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: When the people show signs of hunger, it is not by fate that they perish young or die of starvation. It is because of the heavy taxes imposed upon them.

The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Moreover, in sustaining life, one man plows and does not increase ten *mu* of land. Even in a middle-quality field, the harvest does not exceed four *dan*. His wife, children, and aged dependents rely on this for sustenance. At times, there are calamities of flood or drought. When tribute is demanded, the ruler may pity them—but still, they hunger.

The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In the latter days, greedy tyrants drain their people like fish to satisfy their boundless desires, and so the common folk do not receive the harmonies of Heaven or the virtues of Earth. Thus, the people hunger.

**On the Difficulty of Governing the People**
The *Nanhua Jing* says: The people are difficult to govern because their cleverness is excessive.

The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In later ages, when rulers act, they exhaust the world’s resources yet fail to govern. When superiors desire much, inferiors suffer much. When superiors engage in many affairs, inferiors adopt many guises. To teach the people and then expect them to cease their ways is like fanning flames and hoping they will not burn—it is difficult.

Thus, to stop boiling by adding more water only makes it worse. Those who know the root of governance know to remove the fire. Hence, they are difficult to govern.

The *Tongxuan Jing* says: When superiors act, inferiors also act.

**On the Corruption of Learning and the Lightness of Death**

Scholarly learning opens the door to deceit among the people, yet when their licentious and perverse ways are unleashed, they are abandoned to the law and pursued by punishment—though this only ravages the world. Unable to curb their deceit, they are thus difficult to govern.

**On the Lightness of Death**
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: When the people grow light in death, they perish not by fate but by their own indulgence, ever seeking without restraint, ever desiring without end—until punishment kills them.

Because their craving for life is excessive,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In the latter ages, dim-witted rulers take from the people without measure, demand of them without limit, so that men and women cannot tend to farming and weaving. Their days are numbered, yet they labor endlessly to serve their superiors, their strength exhausted, their wealth depleted—thus they grow light in death.

Thus, the people grow light in death.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: When superiors indulge in boundless taking, inferiors become avaricious without restraint. The people, impoverished and suffering, give rise to strife—thus they grow light in death.

Those who do not value life above all,
The *Nanhua Jing* says: In ancient times, rulers prized life, and prizing life, they held gain in light regard. In later ages, when wealth is scarce, theft arises—yet whom can one blame for this? Blame the rulers who value gain over life.

This is wiser than valuing life.
The *Tongxuan Jing* [Nine Guardians Chapter] says: Only those who do not value life above all can attain true longevity.

**On the People’s Lifespan (Chapter Seventy-Six)**
This chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* speaks: In the Warring States, warfare drained the world’s resources to satisfy one man’s desires—what greater calamity could there be? To indulge one man’s desires is to prolong the suffering of the land, a transgression against Heaven’s order, a grievance of the people, a sin inviting Heaven’s retribution. Thus, the strong in arms perish, for the overmighty are doomed to destruction—how could they not perish?

The people’s birth is gentle and weak,
The *Nanhua Jing* says: Human life is the gathering of harmonious *qi*.
Their death is rigid and strong.
The *Nanhua Jing* says: Human death is the scattering of *qi*—when *qi* scatters, death comes.

All things—grasses and trees—are gentle and tender in life,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In their birth, plants flourish in bloom.
But rigid and withered in death.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In their death, plants wither and decay.

Thus, the rigid and strong are doomed to death,
The *Tongxuan Jing* [Dao Yuan Chapter] says: The rigid and strong are doomed to death.
The gentle and weak are destined to life.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The gentle and weak are destined to life.

Thus, the strong in arms cannot prevail,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Those who seek rigidity must guard with gentleness;
Those who seek strength must guard with weakness.
Accumulated gentleness becomes rigidity,
Accumulated weakness becomes strength.
Observe what they accumulate to know their fate—
Thus, the strong in arms perish.

The rigid tree snaps,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The rigid tree breaks, the rigid hide splits.
The mighty fall from their height,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says:

**Chapter on Supreme Virtue (上德篇)**

The *Laozi* looked upward at the trees in the eaves, then gazed at the rivers below. The strong and rigid trees dwell in the lower eaves, the great in stature occupy the lower branches. The gentle and weak rise above.

The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The small and slender trees dwell in the higher eaves, the weak and slight occupy the upper branches—like stacking firewood, the smallest is placed on top.

**Chapter 77: The Dao of Heaven**
The *Tongxuan Jing* speaks: In ancient times, enlightened rulers governed with moderation, nurtured themselves with restraint, and calculated harvests according to the seasons. They measured the people’s stored provisions, knowing the surplus and deficit, then took only what was needed. Thus, they received what Heaven and Earth bestowed and avoided the suffering of hunger and cold.

When the people were distressed—those who starved ate food without relish, those who froze endured winter without furs—rulers shared in their hardships. Thus, there were no grieving subjects under Heaven.

In later ages, who could use their surplus to nourish the world? Only the ancient Dao-bearing rulers could sustain the widows, orphans, and the lonely, following Heaven’s way to aid the people.

The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven diminishes the full and benefits the scarce. Is it not like drawing a bow?

The *Tongxuan Jing* says: A bow is drawn for shooting, yet without a string, it cannot release. Heaven’s shooting requires no bow—it strikes true.

The high are humbled,
The *Tongxuan Jing* [Guard Weakness Section] says: The Dao of Heaven humbles the high.
The low are raised;
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven raises the low.
The excessive are diminished,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive.
The deficient are supplemented.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven supplements the deficient.

The Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive to nourish the deficient.
The Dao of Earth diminishes the high and benefits the low.
But the Dao of humanity is otherwise,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of the ruler is otherwise, differing from Heaven’s diminishing and benefiting.

It diminishes the deficient,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Yet the people, in their tilling, rely on their wives, children, aged, and weak for sustenance. Facing floods, droughts, and heavy taxes, they struggle to provide.
To nourish the excessive.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ruler takes from the people to serve above, seeking only the surplus.

Who can use their surplus to nourish the world?
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In the later ages, greedy tyrants drain their people to satisfy boundless desires, leaving the masses hungry and cold. Who can nourish the deficient?

Only the Dao-bearing ones.
The *Zhuangzi* says: The ancient sages took care of the old, weak, orphans, and widows, ensuring all were provided for.
Thus, the sages
The *Zhuangzi* says: The ancients were complete—they nurtured all things, and their benevolence extended to the people.

They act without claiming merit,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven and Earth—all things rely on it for existence, yet none know its virtue.
Their work accomplished, they take no credit,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of Heaven and Earth—all things complete their work without dwelling on it, yet none know its virtue.
They do not seek to be seen as virtuous.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The sage is empty of self, seeing only insufficiency. Seeing insufficiency, they achieve true virtue.

**Chapter 78: The Gentle and Weak of the World**
The *Tongxuan Jing* speaks: The sea does not reject the smallest streams to become great; the forests do not reject the crooked and bent to flourish. The sage does not reject humble words to broaden their name. If speech is true, even a common laborer’s words should not be discarded. If speech is false, even the ruler’s ministers should not be heeded. Right and wrong cannot be judged by rank or status.

When the people drown and the ruler does not grieve, he is not a virtuous sovereign. To guard one’s post and die in battle is the duty of a subject. In later ages, few ministers offer sincere loyalty, risking their lives. Those who exhaust their strength and loyalty go unheard.

Thus, the ancient sages modeled themselves after water’s gentleness—enduring shame, accepting criticism, and receiving insults. Rulers should emulate water in receiving defilement.

Nothing in the world is as gentle and weak as water,
The *Tongxuan Jing* [Dao Yuan Section] says: Nothing is as gentle and weak as water.
Yet it conquers the rigid and strong,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of water—it pierces metal and stone, its strength flows through the world.
And none can overcome it,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of water—its course cannot be exhausted, its subtlety cannot be grasped.
Nothing can replace it.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The Dao of water—struck, it leaves no wound; pierced, it suffers no harm; cut, it is not severed; burned, it is not scorched. It flows smoothly, never dispersing.

Thus, the gentle overcomes the rigid,
The *Tongxuan Jing* [Supreme Virtue Section] says: The *Laozi* saw the tongue and guarded gentleness. Though teeth are firmer than the tongue, they decay first.
The weak overcomes the strong.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Accumulated gentleness becomes rigidity; accumulated weakness becomes strength. Without accumulation, this cannot be.

The world
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In the later ages, human nature favors strength and rejects weakness, rigidity and rejects gentleness, yet they do not know their loss and cannot embrace gentleness.

None know,
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The virtuous discern truth and do not trust slander.
None can practice it.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: If counsel is ignored, the ruler is unenlightened.

Thus, the sage
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: The ancient wise rulers modeled themselves after water’s gentleness.

Gentleness and frailty, though subtle and seemingly insignificant, thus attain their lofty heights—virtue and renown arise naturally. It says: *"To bear the filth of the state is to be called the sovereign of the ancestral altars;"* the *Tongxuan Jing* states: *"The ancient sages did not seek deeds that might be criticized, nor did they resent others’ censure of themselves. Though the world condemns them, they do not falter."*

*"To bear the state’s calamities is to be called the king of the world."* The *Tongxuan Jing* says: *"In ancient times, the sages allowed those who slandered them to do so, for it was their own fault."* Words once spoken cannot be recalled by others; actions begun nearby cannot be restrained from afar. Straight speech seems like perversion. The *Tongxuan Jing˙Upper Virtue Chapter* declares: *"In later ages, those who speak are silenced by words, those who advise are executed by law—yet such rulers still hope to preserve harmony across all lands. How far they are from wisdom!"*

**Chapter on Reconciling Great Grievances (79)**
This chapter of the *Tongxuan Jing* states: *"To reconcile great grievances will inevitably leave lingering resentment—how can this be called good?"* In ancient times, the near were drawn close not by words, the distant not by words; the near were made content, the distant were made to come. To share desires with the people brings harmony; to share their defenses brings stability; to share their thoughts brings understanding; to gain their strength brings wealth; to gain their praise brings renown. In the later ages, actions invite bandits, words invite disaster—no one speaks first, yet others have already conspired behind them. Rumors spreading a thousand miles are a calamity. The tongue is a trigger: once words are spoken, they cannot be recalled, even by four swift horses.

This exhorts the Warring States to reconcile their grievances, to cease hostilities and not contend, thus achieving universal peace—now that is good. To reconcile great grievances, the *Tongxuan Jing˙Subtle Brilliance Chapter* says: *"The ancient sages reconciled the world’s grievances, their virtue acting as the binding contract—non-contention was their goodness."* There must be lingering resentment—how can this be called good? The *Tongxuan Jing* says: *"The Warring States lacked the Dao; their conflicts bred resentment—there must be lingering resentment. How can this be called not good?"* Thus, the sage—

the *Zhuangzi* states: *"The ancient sages were fully prepared: to harmonize the world."* Holding the left contract, the *Tongxuan Jing* says: *"Yin harms things; yang transforms them."* The sage’s Dao follows the brilliance of yang to harmonize the world, follows the darkness of yin to reconcile its grievances and ill-will, yet holds no blame toward others. The *Tongxuan Jing* says: *"The greater the resentment, the deeper the calamity."* To harbor resentment without resolution is unheard of. Hence, virtue acts as the binding contract—the *Tongxuan Jing* says: *"Accumulated virtue becomes kingship; accumulated stone becomes mountains."* Without accumulation, this cannot be. Without virtue, there is no binding contract—the *Tongxuan Jing* says: *"Accumulated resentment brings ruin; accumulated water becomes rivers."* Without accumulation, this cannot be.

The Dao of Heaven favors none, always aiding the virtuous. The *Tongxuan Jing* says: *"The Dao of Heaven favors none, only virtue is rewarded."*

**Chapter on Small States and Few People (80)**
This chapter of the *Zhuangzi* (in the *Inner Chamber of the Chest* section) states: *"In the ancient age of supreme virtue, the clans of Róngchéng, Dàtíng, Bóhuáng, Zhōngyāng, Lìlù, Líxù, Hèxiū, Zūnlú, Zhùróng, Fúxī, Shénnóng, and Xuānyuán ruled. At that time, the people tied knots in cords for use, relished their food, adorned their dress, found comfort in their dwellings, and delighted in their customs. Neighboring states could see one another, and the sounds of roosters and dogs mingled in the air—yet the people lived until old age and death without visiting one another."* Such a time, when knots were tied in simplicity and the people were unadorned, universal peace meant supreme governance.

Small states, few people—the *Tongxuan Jing˙Symbolic Speech Chapter* says: *"To command ten thousand soldiers is not as good as to hear a single apt word; to possess the pearl of Duke Hòu is not as good as to grasp the proper means of governance; to hold the jade of Héshì is not as good as to align with the fitting course of affairs."* Though the world be vast, those who delight in war perish; though the state be stable, those who love contention are in peril. Thus, small states with few people, though they possess myriad implements, do not use them.

Though they possess myriad implements, they do not use them—the *Dònglíng Jing* says: *"The ancient sage-kings flourished by encouraging agriculture and teaching the people to till the land, to make death weighty and not wander far."* The *Tongxuan Jing* says: *"When Fúxī ruled the world, his virtue gave life without taking it."* At that time, there was no heart of profit or harm; the world was at peace. Though there were boats and carriages, there was no need to ride them—the *Zhuangzi* says: *"In the age of Shénnóng, when resting he slept soundly, when moving he walked leisurely, the people knew their mothers but not their fathers, and lived with deer and elk without malice. This was the peak of supreme virtue."*

Though there were armor and weapons, they were not displayed—the *Tongxuan Jing* says: *"Huángdì’s governance of the world refined the essence of sun and moon, regulated the qi of yin and yang, balanced the rhythms of the four seasons, established the laws of music and the calendar, distinguished male and female, clarified high and low. Farmers yielded the edges of their fields, and travelers did not pick up lost goods."* The people once again tied knots in cords for use—the *Zhuangzi* says: *"In the upper antiquity of supreme virtue, there was no action—yet the world was governed with ease, and both ruler and ruled were without strife."* The ruler did not act; the people did not act. They relished their food—the *Zhuangzi* says: *"The ancient people gathered acorns and chestnuts by day, and found their food sweet—thus they were called the people who knew life."* They adorned their dress—the *Zhuangzi* says: *"The ancient people did not know clothing, yet in summer they piled firewood, and in winter they burned it—thus their dress was beautiful, and they were called the people who knew life."*

The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times, their clothing was warm yet undecorated. They settled comfortably in their dwellings—
*The Nanhua Jing* says: The ancient people lived in nests and caves, resting in trees at dusk, finding comfort in their homes, thus they were called the people of the *Youchao Clan*.

The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times of great peace, neither soldiers nor horses crossed the borders of neighboring states, nor did armored chariot tracks extend beyond a thousand miles—all found comfort in their dwellings. They delighted in their customs—
*The Nanhua Jing* says: The ancient people delighted in their customs.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times, deceit did not arise; they lived in ease without strife, the world at harmony, their customs joyful.

Neighboring states lay in sight—
*The Nanhua Jing* says: In ancient times, neighboring states lay in sight, yet mountains had no paths or tunnels, marshes no bridges or ferries.
The sounds of roosters and dogs reached one another—
*The Nanhua Jing* says: In ancient times, the sounds of roosters and dogs reached one another, all creatures thrived in groups, bound to their lands.
The people lived until old age—
*The Nanhua Jing* says: In ancient times, the people lived until old age.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times, the strong did not oppress the weak, the many did not harm the few, so the people preserved their lives and did not die young.

They did not interact with one another—
*The Nanhua Jing* says: The ancient people lived alongside deer, hunted for food, and knew how to clothe themselves, with no intent to harm one another. They did not interact—this was the height of virtue.

*"True words are not ornate"*—Chapter Eighty-One of *Nanhua Zhenjing* speaks of the ancient Dao/Way and its techniques, which lay in *wuwei* (non-action). Laozi heard its teachings and rejoiced. He established it with the constant *wu* (non-being), governed it with *Taiyi* (Supreme Oneness), taking gentleness, humility, and yielding as its outward form, and emptiness, non-destruction of all things as its substance.

Laozi said: *"While others take what comes first, I take what comes last—thus I bear the world’s impurities. While others take what is solid, I take what is empty—thus I have no hoarding, and so I have abundance. While others seek fortune, I preserve myself—thus I avoid blame. I root myself in depth, bind myself with restraint, saying: ‘The rigid is destroyed, the sharp is blunted.’ In non-action, I laugh at cleverness, always yielding to things, never harming others—this is the utmost extreme."*

Laozi—truly the ancient sage of vast truth!

*"True words are not ornate,"*
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times, the Great Dao was loyal yet simple, and the people had no deceit.
*"Ornate words are not true."*
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Later generations knew contracts yet trust declined; they knew machinery yet substance declined. Minor cleverness breaks the Dao, harshness injures virtue.

*"The good do not argue,"*
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times, the Dao was upright, non-action was not perilous, so the people easily followed.
The *Dongling Jing* says: Knowing without arguing is called the Dao; the Dao brings peace to the people.
*"Those who argue are not good."*
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Later generations knew writing yet the Dao declined; minor arguments harmed the upright.
The *Dongling Jing* says: Knowing and then arguing is called discernment, used to govern people.
*The Nanhua Jing* says: Yet argument is never beneficial.

*"The wise are not all-knowing,"*
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: In ancient times of perfect governance, there was no labor, all were at ease, so the common people were not harmed.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: Later generations knew calculations yet benevolence declined; minor achievements harmed governance.
*The Nanhua Jing* says: Yet knowledge without breadth is not wisdom.

*"The sage does not accumulate,"*
*The Nanhua Jing* says: The sage’s Dao flows without hoarding, thus all under heaven submitted.
Clear in Heaven, harmonious with the sage, with six penetrations and non-action, four openings in emptiness and stillness—those who embody the virtue of the sovereign—things act of themselves. In darkness, there is nothing that is not still.

*"To accumulate is insufficient; to hoard is to lack."*
The sage is cautious in what is accumulated.
Having given to others—
*The Nanhua Jing* says: Having given to others, the self becomes ever more abundant.
The *Tongxuan Jing* says: If kings and nobles uphold the Yang Dao, all things flourish; if they uphold the Yin Dao, the world perishes. If Yang does not descend to Yin, all things cannot form; if the ruler does not descend to the subject, virtue cannot spread.

*"The self becomes ever more abundant,"*
The *Chongxu Jing* says: Yao governed the world, wandering in broad streets, hearing children’s songs:
*"Establish our boiling people,
None but you are supreme."*
Not knowing, not knowing—
Following the Emperor’s way.
Having given to others...

*The Nanhua Jing* says: Having given to others, the self grows ever more abundant.

*The Tongxuan Jing* says: Kings and nobles dwell above the people, illuminating virtue and Dao. The noble withdraws from vice and embraces goodness, and the people do not stray far. Thus, the people have choices to depart or remain—when faults are severe, departures increase; when goodness prevails, those who stay grow ever more abundant.

*The Chongxu Jing* says: Yao rejoiced and asked the children, *"Who taught you to speak thus?"* The children replied, *"It is an ancient poem, and all the people sing with full bellies."* The Way of Heaven—

*The Nanhua Jing* says: The Heavenly Dao moves without accumulation, and thus all things flourish. It benefits without harming.

*The Tongxuan Jing* says: The sun rises from the earth, and all things thrive. When thunder moves, all things awaken; when rain nourishes, all things are refreshed.

The Sage’s Dao—

*The Nanhua Jing* says: The Imperial Dao moves without accumulation, and thus the world unites. The Sage’s mind is still, a mirror of Heaven and Earth, a reflection of all things. The world is at peace. Acting without contention.

*The Tongxuan Jing* says: The noble’s actions resemble the Dao. The movement of Yin and Yang follows fixed rhythms; the noble’s actions do not exhaust things. The wind does not stir without cause, fire does not flare without fuel. The noble does not speak, and the petty cannot fabricate. When fire emerges, it must await kindling; when the noble speaks, it must be true. With truth and sincerity, what cannot be accomplished?
