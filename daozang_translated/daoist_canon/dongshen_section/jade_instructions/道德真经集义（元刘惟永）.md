**The Collected Meanings of the Dao/Way and Virtue/Power**

**Title:** *The Collected Meanings of the Dao/Way and Virtue/Power*
**Compiled by:** Yuan Dynasty Liu Weiyong
**Volume:** Seventeen
**Source of the base text:** *The Zhengheng Daoist Canon* (洞神部), *Jade Precepts Category* (玉诀类)

**Volume One: Master Ningyuan’s Dao/Way and Virtue/Power at Xuanmiao Guan on the Changde Path**
**Compiled by:** Liu Weiyong, with guidance from Master Ningyuan
**Corrected by:** Former imperial official Ding Yidong, who served as *Taifu Temple Clerk* (太府寺簿) and *Editor at the Secretariat* (枢密院编修)

**The Dao/Way and Virtue/Power (Dao De Jing) – Critical Examination of Variations**
**Note on textual differences:** *He Shang Gong’s* edition divides *The Dao/Way and Virtue/Power* into two sections; this follows *Wang Fushi’s* edition instead.

**The Sage of the Dao/Way says:**
The Dao/Way is the path all share in common;
Virtue/Power is what the heart universally attains.
The Dao/Way endures through all ages without decay,
Virtue/Power fills the nature and remains forever.

At the close of the Zhou Dynasty,
the Dao/Way descended while Virtue/Power waned,
thus the sage composed ninety-nine chapters to elucidate the eternal principles of Dao/Way and Virtue/Power,
and called it *The Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Scripture*.
Its words are concise, its meaning profound—
scholars must discern and delve deeply into it.

**Huang Maocai said:**
The Dao/Way is what all must pass through to be born;
Virtue/Power is what all must attain to be nourished.
The heavens and earth use this to give birth and sustain all things,
thus they are inexhaustible;
The perfected sage uses this to give birth and sustain the self,
thus they do not die.

Though the Dao/Way and Virtue/Power have two names,
in truth they serve as one—
they cannot be separated.
In the present age, scholars divide the upper chapters as *The Dao/Way*
and the lower chapters as *Virtue/Power*,
which is far from the original intent of the work.
It would be better to call it *The Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Scripture* in its entirety.

**Shi Tan said:**
There are many interpretations of *The Laozi*,
but those by Confucian scholars—
such as Cheng Tai’s and Lin Zhuhan’s—
often explain the Dao/Way in terms of Confucian *dao*,
as if it were the principle guiding daily conduct.
Those by Buddhist scholars—
such as Su Yingbin’s and Benlai Zi’s—
often explain it in terms of Buddhist *xing* (性),
as if it were the bare, naked nature of beings.
Neither approach captures the original meaning,
for Confucian *dao* refers to the principle within ordinary affairs,
while Laozi’s *dao* is the voidless, natural Way.
How can one forcefully align Laozi’s *dao* with Confucianism?
Buddhist *xing* (性) refers to the pure emptiness untainted by form or *qi*,
while Laozi’s *dao* encompasses the harmonious interplay of form and spirit.
How can one forcefully align Laozi’s *dao* with Buddhism?

Though it is said that "under heaven there is no second Dao/Way"
and "the sage has no dual heart,"
yet the benevolent see it as benevolence,
and the wise see it as wisdom—
their distinctions must be clearly understood.

Confucian scholars explain *dao* as the principle beyond form,
yet they hold that it does not depart from the instruments of the lower realm.
Buddhist scholars explain *xing* (性) as pure emptiness,
yet they exclude form and *qi*.
Laozi, however, seeks the marvelous unity of form and spirit,
so that they may align with the true Dao/Way.
This is why their interpretations differ.

If each adheres strictly to their own teaching,
not only will they fail to grasp Laozi’s core intent,
but they will also lose sight of their own true teachings.

As for Daoist interpretations—
such as those by Bai Yuxian—
they are indeed faithful to the original,
but they tend to favor lofty abstractions and oversimplification,
making the text obscure and rendering it akin to Guo Xiang’s commentary on *The Zhuangzi*.
Thus, this present commentary
adheres strictly to Laozi’s original teaching,
so as not to stray from his true intent,
yet it avoids the lofty obscurity of Bai Yuxian’s style.

Scholars should examine this carefully.

**Chapter: "The Dao/Way That Can Be Spoken Of"**
**Note on textual differences:** *He Shang Gong* titled this chapter *"The Chapter of Embodiment"* (体道章),
and Zhao Shixian titled it *"The Chapter of Illuminating Principles and True Meanings"* (显理会真义章).
This follows the *Ming Huang* (Tang Emperor) edition.

**Tang Emperor’s commentary on this chapter:**
At the origin of all marvelous transformations and the source of ten thousand changes,
the chapter first marks the Dao/Way as *the void’s utmost* (虚极),
to reveal where all marvels converge.
Thus, "the Dao/Way that can be spoken of" and "the name that can be given"
clarify the substance and function of the Dao/Way;
"without name, yet with name" reveals the essence and its traces;
"without desire, yet with desire" distinguishes two perspectives;
"the same origin, yet different names" shows how the undifferentiated gives rise to all things;
"the same name, yet called the mysterious" shows how all things return to the undifferentiated.
"Mysterious again, mysterious again" elucidates the interplay of unity and forgetfulness.
"The gateway of all marvels" indicates the path by which one attains enlightenment and exits.

These are the stages of progress and refinement,
the gradual path to enlightenment and true understanding.

**Du Guangting’s *Broad Commentary on the Daoist Canon* (广圣义) explaining the Emperor’s commentary:**
*"Ming"* (明) means luminous and pure—
to reveal openly.
*"Miao ben"* (妙本) refers to the Dao/Way.
At the beginning of the Scripture,
it clarifies the Dao/Way’s origin.
*"You"* (由) means to follow;
*"Qi"* (起) means to arise.
*"Wan"* (万) signifies the vastness of numbers.
*"Hua"* (化) means transformation and adaptation—
it speaks of all things arising from the Dao/Way through transformation.
*"Zong"* (宗) means master;
*"yuan"* (源) means origin.
Since all transformations arise from the Dao/Way,
then knowing the Dao/Way is the master and origin of all transformations.

From this chapter, all principles emerge,
like the ceaseless flow of water from its source.
*"Xu ji"* (虚极) is the Dao/Way’s marvelous origin,
the Dao/Way being its ultimate designation.

This chapter first marks the Dao/Way that can be spoken of as its substance,
and the name that can be given as its function.
The final chapter returns to the gateway of all marvels,
where all traces converge toward the Dao/Way’s origin,
and once again directs us toward the Dao/Way’s true essence.

Within this gateway, seven distinctions are made:
1. *"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of"* and *"the name that can be given"* clarify its substance and function.
2. *"Substance and function"* (体用) means mutual reliance.
   Substance has no fixed form, function has no fixed application—
   without function, substance cannot be displayed;
   without substance, function cannot be established.
   Sometimes there is substance, sometimes function;
   sometimes both are real, sometimes provisional;
   sometimes manifest, sometimes symbolic;
   sometimes named, sometimes represented—
   they mutually define each other,
   alternating to reveal their nature.
   Thus, substance and function are understood as interdependent clarifications.

3. *"Without name, yet with name"* reveals the Dao/Way’s essence and its traces.
   Essence and traces are mutually generative.
   There is essence, then traces arise;
   traces lead us to the essence.
   Without essence, traces cannot appear;
   without traces, essence cannot be sought—
   traces emerge with each event,
   serving as the essence’s manifestation.

The root is the **origin**—
the traces, the **manifestation**.
Traces are the footprints left behind,
yet are they truly the foot?
Traces arise from the foot,
but to take traces as the foot
and then command others to walk upon them—
this only further distances one from the Dao.

Thus, traces are the **end**.

3. *"With desire and without desire"*—
the two perspectives differ.
**Observation** is the **practice** itself.
One observes with the **self’s perception**,
another with the **spirit’s discernment**.
To still the sight externally,
to concentrate the spirit internally,
to illuminate the single mind within,
to forget the myriad forms without—
this is called **observation**.

It serves as the **stage for Daoist practice**,
the **gradual path to veracity**,
first relying on observation and practice,
entering the **Gate of the Mysterious**.

The Dao cannot be attained by name,
nor sought through form—
thus, observation and practice become the **path of cultivation**.
For those with desire, it leads to **death**;
for those without desire, it aligns with **life**.
Thus, one observes **life and death**,
their paths diverging.

4. *"Same origin, different names"*—
the **Uncarved Block** disperses into **vessels**.
The **Great Uncarved Block** is the **Dao**.
The Dao disperses as **spiritual luminosity**,
flows as **sun and moon**,
divides into **the Five Phases**,
gives birth to **all things**.
**Vessels** are **formed with function**.
The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"What is above form is called the Dao;
what is below form is called vessels."*

5. *"Called the Mysterious"*—
the **return to the Uncarved Block after formation**.
Spiritual luminosity, sun and moon,
the Five Phases, all things—
though formed and vessel-like,
they all conform to the Dao,
hence, **"return to the Uncarved Block."**

6. *"The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious"*—
discerning **dual forgetting**.
When forming vessels,
one must remain in the Uncarved Block.
After returning to the Uncarved Block,
this Uncarved Block is also forgotten—
only then does one **harmonize with the Dao**.
Thus, it is called *"the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious."*
**Dual forgetting** means
forgetting both vessel and Uncarved Block.

7. *"The Gate of All Mysteries"*—
showing the **path of transcendence**.
When vessel and Uncarved Block are both forgotten,
one clearly harmonizes with the Dao,
returning to the **beginning of transformation**—
the **Gate of All Mysteries**.
Humans and all things equally receive from the Dao;
with **action and desire**, one loses the Dao and harms life.
By **abandoning desire and preserving harmony**, one returns to the root—
this is called the **essential gateway of the Dao**.
**Transcendence** is **leaving the world**.

Zhang Chong replied:
The **Dao** is the **natural Way**—
heaven, though highest, does not know what it covers;
this is the **naturalness of Heaven’s Dao**.
Earth, though vast, does not know what it bears;
this is the **naturalness of Earth’s Dao**.
Humans, standing between heaven and earth,
have eyes to see, like heaven’s sun and moon;
have mouths to speak, like heaven’s thunder.
Breathing brings wind, exhaling brings mist,
spittle and coughs like rain and dew—
their **hearing and awareness** mirror **spiritual luminosity**,
all the **naturalness of Heaven’s Dao**, which I possess.

As for the four limbs complete,
like the four **directions** steadfastly grounded,
the **sacred bone** at the crown,
like **Mount Sumeru** towering—
blood flowing through the vessels,
like rivers encircling—
this is the **naturalness of Earth’s Dao**, which I also possess.

If one truly embodies the **natural Dao of heaven and earth**
and cultivates it further,
the turbid becomes clear,
the ordinary attains immortality,
and the virtuous becomes sage.
Thus, **"Embodying the Dao"** is the first chapter of *The Daoist Classic*.

The Dao that can be spoken is **not the eternal Dao**.
The name that can be named is **not the eternal name**.
**Nameless**, it is the **beginning of heaven and earth**.
**Named**, it is the **mother of all things**.
Thus, one must **constantly observe without desire** to see its **mystery**,
and **constantly observe with desire** to see its **outcome**.

These two, though of the same origin, bear different names—
both called the **Mysterious**,
the **Mysterious beyond the Mysterious**,
the **Gate of All Mysteries**.

**Annotations from the Emperor’s Edition** omit the *"without"* character;
here, following the **River Upper Master’s** version.

The **River Upper Master** said:
*"The Dao that can be spoken"* refers to **doctrine, governance, and teaching**.
*"Not the eternal Dao"* means it is **not the natural, long-life Dao**.
The **eternal Dao** constantly **nurtures the spirit with non-action**,
**governs without interference**, **conceals light and hides brilliance**,
**erases traces and obscures origins**—
it cannot be named as the Dao.

*"The name that can be named"* refers to **wealth, nobility, and eternal honor**.
*"Not the eternal name"* means it is **not the natural, enduring name**.
The **eternal name** is like an **infant before speech**,
an **egg before hatching**,
a **pearl within the shell**,
a **jewel in stone**—
though internally luminous,
externally it appears **foolish and crude**.

**Nameless** is the **beginning of heaven and earth**.
**Nameless** refers to the **Dao**.
The Dao is formless, hence **unnamable**.
**Beginning** is the **origin of the Dao**.
It exhales *qi* and spreads transformation,
emerging from **emptiness and non-being**,
as the **origin of heaven and earth**.

**Named** is the **mother of all things**.
**Named** refers to **heaven and earth**.
Heaven and earth have **form, position, yin, and yang**,
**hardness and softness**—this is their **named** quality.
**Mother of all things**—heaven and earth contain *qi* and give birth to all things,
nurturing them to maturity, like a mother rearing her child.

Thus, one must **constantly observe without desire** to grasp its **essence**.
**Essence** is the **key**.
If one constantly **abandons desire**, they can observe the **core of the Dao**.
**Core** means **unity**.
Unity issues forth, spreading **named principles**,
clarifying **right and wrong**.

One must **constantly observe with desire** to see its **outcome**.
**Outcome** means **return**.
Those who constantly **hold desire** can observe the **trends of the world**.

These two, though of the same origin, bear different names—
the two refer to **with and without desire**,
same origin means **both arise from human nature**,
yet different names refer to their **distinct outcomes**.
The name **"without desire"** leads to **eternal life**,
the name **"with desire"** leads to **self-destruction**.

Both are called the **Mysterious**.
**Mysterious** means **heaven**.
It speaks of those with and without desire **both receiving *qi* from heaven**.

**The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious**—
within heaven, there is another heaven.
The **thickness of received *qi*** varies—
those who obtain **central harmony and nourishment** become **sage and virtuous**,
those who receive **disorder and corruption** become **greedy and lustful**.

**The Gate of All Mysteries**—
to know that within heaven there is another heaven,
that received *qi* varies in thickness,
and to **eliminate emotions, abandon desire**,
**preserving central harmony**—
this is called knowing the **essential gateway of the Dao**.

**Wang Fu-si** said:
*"The Dao that can be spoken, until it reaches the eternal name."*

The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao;
The name that can be named is not the constant name.
To point to things and shape forms is not its eternal essence—
Thus, it cannot be spoken, cannot be named.

The **Nameless** is the mother of all things.
All that exists begins from the **Nameless**—
Thus, before form and name arise,
It is the origin of all things.

When form and name appear,
It nurtures, sustains, and guides them—
It is their mother.

It speaks of the Dao:
Beginning from formless, nameless,
It gives rise to all things,
Yet its origin and completion are unknown—
**Mysterious beyond the Mysterious**.

Thus, one must **constantly be without desire** to perceive its subtlety.
**Subtlety** is the utmost refinement.
All things begin from the subtle and then take form,
From the **Nameless** and then come to life—
Thus, one must **constantly be without desire**,
Empty and void within,
To perceive the subtlety of their origin.

One must **constantly have desire** to perceive its **boundaries**.
**Boundaries** mean **completion**.
All that exists, for its utility,
Must rely on the **Nameless** for its use.
The root of desire,
When aligned with the Dao, finds fulfillment.

Thus, one must **constantly have desire**,
To perceive the completion of all things’ boundaries.
These two are the **Gate of All Mysteries**.

Both originate from the **Mother**,
Emerging together from the **Mysterious**—
Though their names differ in application,
At the beginning, it is called **Origin**,
At the end, it is called **Mother**.

The **Mysterious** is the **Dark**—
Silent, without form.
The **Origin** and **Mother** arise from it,
Yet cannot be named—
Thus, it cannot be spoken.
The same is called **Mysterious**,
And when spoken of, it is called **Mysterious**,
Taken from what cannot be grasped and thus named so.

To call it so,
Is to say it cannot be confined to a single **Mysterious**—
To name it thus is to stray far.

Thus, it is said: **Mysterious beyond the Mysterious**.
All subtleties arise from the same source—
Thus, it is called the **Gate of All Mysteries**.

Emperor Tang Minghuang said:
*The Dao that can be spoken reaches the point of no name.*

The **Dao** is the **uttermost subtlety in action**;
The **name** is the designation given to things as they receive its use.
Its use applies to things—
Thus, it is called *speakable Dao*.
Names arise from use—
Thus, it is called *nameable name*.

If its application is boundless and without fixed form,
Then it transcends a single Dao;
If things differ and names vary,
Then it transcends a single name.

Thus, it is forcibly named **Dao**,
Yet the Dao is always **Nameless**.

**Commentary:**
The **Dao** is the **forcible name** for the **uttermost subtlety of origin**.
*Training* (通训) and *direct instruction* (径首一字) mark the essence.
That which can be spoken of is this **subtle origin**,
The pathway through which all things arise—
Thus, it is called *speakable Dao*.
That which is **not the constant Dao** is the **subtle origin** in transformation,
Its use without fixed direction—
Forcibly named, yet not confined to one Dao—
Thus, it is called *not the constant Dao*.

The **name** is the designation given to things as they receive the Dao’s use.
The first character marks the essence.
That which can be named is because names arise from use—
Thus, it is called *nameable name*.
That which is **not the constant name**—
In Heaven, it is called *Clear*,
On Earth, it is called *Tranquil*,
In the Spirit, it is called *Numinous*,
In the Valley, it is called *Full*—
Though one, their applications differ—
Thus, it is called *not the constant name*.

The **Nameless** is the mother of all things.
The **Nameless** is the **subtle origin**.
The **subtle origin**, manifesting as *qi*,
Supports Heaven and Earth—
Heaven and Earth rely on it for their beginning—
Thus, it is called the **Nameless**.

The **Named** is its application.
Its application, skillfully applied,
Nurtures all things—
Things receive their nourishment,
Thus, they have names.

**Commentary:**
The **Nameless** is before transformations arise,
Without forcible naming.
The **subtle origin** at its beginning,
Before the **Nameless** descends as *qi*,
Opens and establishes Heaven and Earth.
Heaven and Earth mutually support each other as their origin—
Thus, it is called the **Nameless**, the origin of Heaven and Earth.
This is the *Taiji* generating the *Two Principles* in the *Yijing*.

*Powering and supporting* (权舆) means *beginning* (as in the *Er Ya*).
The **Named** is its skillful application,
With forcible naming.
When transformations arise and all things are formed,
The **subtle origin** branches outward,
Providing for human use—
Through its abundant nourishment,
It is called the **Mother**.

The **Mother** is defined by its abundant nourishment—
Yet the **Nameless** and **Named** are distinctions made by the Sage
To clarify the unity and difference of origin and trace,
While the Dao does not depend on having or lacking names.

**Constantly without desire** to perceive its subtlety,
**Constantly with desire** to perceive its boundaries.

Humans are born in stillness—
This is Heaven’s nature;
When moved by things, they act—
This is the nature of desire.
If one constantly guards purity and clarity,
Releases the mind and frees the spirit,
Returns to reflect the true nature,
Then one perceives the **subtle origin**.

If one does not govern one’s emotions,
Chases desires and moves,
The nature is lost to desire,
Lost to the Dao’s source—
To perceive the **subtle origin**,
One only sees its **boundaries**.

**Desire** is the movement of nature—
To say it is to establish teaching through thought.
**Constantly without desire** means
The nature is pure and clear,
Without attachment to speech or thought,
Then one sees the Dao’s utmost subtlety.

**Constantly with desire** means
From the origin, action arises,
Teaching follows speech,
Responding to things and communicating effortlessly,
Transforming the world—
Then one sees where all people converge.

**Boundaries** mean **convergence**.
These two arise together yet differ in name—
As above, both originate from the Dao—
Thus, they are the same.
Action emerges from application,
Names are established by use—
Thus, their names differ.

This refers to the matters above:
The two—**speakable/unspeakable Dao**, **named/nameless**, **with/without desire**—
Each has its pair—
Thus, they are called the two.

「Both share the wondrous origin,
Thus, they are called the same.

From the origin descending,
Names are established by application—
Thus, their names differ.

The same is called **Dao/Way**,
When it manifests, names differ—
The same is called **Dao/Way**.

**Dao/Way** is profound and wondrous.
When it is spoken of as manifest,
Names differ—
This is descending from the origin to describe its traces.

When it is spoken of as the same,
It is profound and wondrous—
This is gathering traces to return to the origin.

Returning to the origin is profound and wondrous,
Thus, it is called **Dao/Way**.

The **Dao/Way** again profound,
Is the gateway to all wondrous things.
When the **intention-root** does not arise,
It aligns with the profound and wondrous—
Yet still, one may cling to **Dao/Way** as stagnation,
Failing to achieve dual forgetfulness—
Thus, it is entrusted with **Dao/Way** again profound,
To dispel **Dao/Way** itself.

To **illuminate the Dao/Way of non-desire in non-desire**—
If one can do this,
All dharmas emerge through it—
Thus, it is called the gateway to all wondrous things.

Gathering traces and returning to the origin is called profound and wondrous.
If one dwells in this wondrous state,
Further progress remains—
Though differing in name,
It is equal without distinction—
Thus, it is entrusted with **Dao/Way** again profound,
To dispel **Dao/Way**,
Lest one become stagnant in **Dao/Way**,
And achieve dual forgetfulness—
This is called **non-abiding**.

**Non-abiding** then reveals all.

The **intention-root** is annotated in the *Sutra of the Western Ascension* as:
*"Same origin, differing names—
Each thing generates its own intention-root."*

Now, when the **intention-root** does not arise,
It aligns with the profound and wondrous.

To **illuminate the Dao/Way of non-desire in non-desire**—
This is the desire to eliminate desire,
Thus, seeking non-desire;
Desire to seek non-desire,
Its origin is already detached from desire.

When desire is truly absent,
Non-desire is also absent—
Dispelling again and again,
This is called **total forgetfulness**.

Observing thus directly,
This is called all wondrous things.

Though their wondrousness is manifold,
All emerge from this gateway—
Thus, it is called the gateway to all wondrous things.

Du Guangting’s *Expanded Explanation of the Sacred Meaning* states:
**"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao/Way."**

The **Dao/Way** is the utmost emptiness and extremity,
Neither form nor sound,
Enduring through later kalpas yet not ceasing,
Preceding heaven and earth yet not beginning.
Roundly permeating, serene and tranquil,
Neither beginning nor ceasing—
Sages, through the **virtue/power** of **permeating transformation**,
Can trace its manifestations,
Yet its origin can be **awakened**—
Thus, they name the **virtue/power** of **permeating transformation** as **Dao/Way**.

The **principle** is marked by the single character,
Which is **non-action and formless**—
The **substance** of **Dao/Way**.
The two characters **"can be spoken of"**—
Are **manifestation and transformation**—
The **functions** of **Dao/Way**.

Within these three characters,
The **substance** and **functions** are established.
The **substance** is wondrous beyond measure,
The **functions** are vast beyond reckoning—
Thus, it is the wondrous origin of **emptiness to the extreme**.

Dispersed, it becomes all things,
Unconstrained by a single direction—
Thus, it is called **without fixed direction**.

But adhering to the single **Dao/Way**,
It clarifies that all things rely on **Dao/Way** for transformation—
Thus, it does not favor partiality.

Lofty yet without limit,
It contains all without exclusion—
This is **greatness**.

Lofty yet without limit,
It does not cling to the lofty—
Great yet without bounds,
It does not cling to the outer—
This is **transience**.

**Transience**, meaning to go forth,
Penetrates the boundless,
Reaching all without obstruction—
This is **distant**.

Empty-hearted, abiding in the single **Dao/Way**,
This is the **return and restoration**.
**Return**, meaning to revert—
Thus, it is called the **return and restoration**.

This draws from Chapter Twenty-Five of the *Dao De Jing*:
*"From the origin, all things arise—
Thus, it is called the constant Dao/Way."*

From this, one may infer:
That which does not constantly abide in its place
Is called the **non-constant Dao/Way**.

Names that can be named are **non-constant names**.
Names are true speech.
The single character **"principle"** is the origin of names,
The two characters **"can be named"** are its traces.

Traces disperse in things,
Called the **ten thousand particulars**—
From traces to the origin,
They merge with **Dao/Way**—
Thus, **Dao/Way** is the origin of names,
Names are the end of **Dao/Way**.

Origin and end mutually generate,
To complete transformation.
Without function, **Dao/Way** congeals;
With function, names are established.

Heaven, obtaining **Dao/Way**, manifests the clear and bright forms,
Earth, obtaining **Dao/Way**, is solid and tranquil,
The **spiritual** obtains **Dao/Way**, transformation ceaselessly,
The **valleys** obtain **Dao/Way**, fullness without deficiency.

This draws from Chapter Two of the *Dao De Jing* to clarify its meaning.

Names dispersed without limit,
This is called the **non-constant Dao/Way of Luo**.

The **nameless** is the beginning of heaven and earth.
The **nameless** is the **emptiness to the extreme**, the wondrous origin,
Before the **virtue/power** of **Dao/Way** is established.
The beginning of the wondrous origin,
There is no **nameless**—
From origin descending to traces,
Generating heaven and generating earth—
Heaven and earth rely on the beginning,
Thus, it is said: the **nameless** is the beginning of heaven and earth.

The **great Dao/Way** exhales **qi** and spreads it across the void,
Becoming the origin of heaven and earth.

From the beginning, there is no **nameless**—
As the *Zhuangzi*’s **"Heaven and Earth"** chapter says:
*"At the dawn of creation, there was the **non-being**,
And the **non-being** had no name."*

The **non-being** already without name,
Cannot be questioned with **Dao/Way**,
Cannot be elucidated with names—
Mingled and indistinct, tranquil and vast,
Enduring as the **master of transformation**—
The **original qi** relies on it to begin.

The **profound transformation** receives it and attains life—
Thus, it is said: the **nameless** is the beginning of heaven and earth.

The **nameless** has no lineage,
Then descending and advancing,
Gradually forming signs and shapes—
Thus, heaven and earth are born,
And the **forms of qi** are established.

The **Great Ultimate** is when form and substance are complete.
Form and substance complete,
Then the **two principles** are divided—
Humans are born within them,
Thus forming the **three talents**.

The **named** is the mother of all things.
**All transformations** refer to their multiplicity.
**All things**—
Within all things, **Dao/Way** is nowhere absent.
Even the finest hair of autumn,
**Dao/Way** dwells within it—
Thus, it can generate the **three talents**,
And be the mother of all things.

All things—
**Dao/Way** exists, they are born;
**Dao/Way** departs, they perish.
The utmost **nourishment and containment**,
Is it not called the mother?

The **great Dao/Way** is without difference or sameness,
Without origin or traces—
Yet through the **virtue/power** of **Dao/Way** and teaching,
Its origin and traces are revealed.

**Constantly without desire** reaches its limit,
To observe its **convergence**.

The **mechanical mind** lodged in the chest,
Is pure white yet not perfected in **spiritual virtue**—
One who **abides in the body** is not harmonious,
This is **desire**.
If the **mind of harming** is forgotten within,
Even a tiger’s tail can be trodden—
What more of humans?

This is **non-desire**.
The **desiring** cling to ears and eyes for seeing and hearing,
Exhaust the mind and thoughts for reasoning—
Seeing and hearing grow more confused,
Reasoning grows more disordered—
This can be called observing the **boundaries of convergence**.

The **non-desiring** merge their **spirit** with the void,
Their **qi** with the **non-being**—
Reaching all without obstruction,
Penetrating all without hindrance—
Aligning with the function of heaven and earth,
They merge with the **great Dao/Way**,
This can be called observing its **wondrousness**.

The observer, externally surveys with the eyes,
Internally illuminates with the spirit—
The eyes discern the presence and absence,
The spirit resonates with the silent void.

Humans are born in stillness—
This is the nature of Heaven, as spoken in *The Record of Music*.
It speaks of nature being inherently pure and tranquil,
Without desire or striving.
When moved by things, stirred by circumstances,
Sensations arise from without and stir within—
How can one be cautious of what one is moved by?

Thus, the Sage establishes laws to curb their wickedness,
Institutes rites to curb their chaos,
Enacts punishments to curb their excesses,
Creates music to curb their licentiousness.
By the Dao restraining desire,
This is how the people are taught to revere virtue and pursue goodness.

These two [paths] arise from the same source but differ in name.

From the One Qi, myriad transformations arise;
From the emergence of forms, myriad things manifest.
The three transformations vary, yet twofold—
From non-being, being emerges—
This is what is meant.

When the Dao is manifest, names are established;
When names are established, desire arises—
This is where the Dao can be spoken of,
Where names can be named,
Where the mechanism of desire is ignited.
This is how traces arise from their roots.

To **shelter the traces** is to abandon desire, forget names,
And return to the wondrous root of the Dao—
To forget the Dao in names,
To forget names is to return to the root.

Those who follow their emotions chase desire and forget the root,
Descending into slipperiness—
Only those who return to the origin of things
Can speak of the utmost Dao.

Both are called **mysterious**.

Those with desire and those without desire
Receive qi from Heaven and Earth.
If they receive the balanced, harmonious essence,
They become virtuous and sage, acting without doing.
If they receive turbid, chaotic qi,
They become dull and foolish, with many desires.

If one can purify the heart, transform thoughts,
Clarify desire and contain emptiness,
Then they are those who shelter the traces and return to the root.

When all cultivate and refine themselves,
And customs return to simplicity and harmony,
The wind of returning to simplicity
Can reach the ancient past.

Mysterious beyond mysterious—
The gateway to all wonders.

To shelter the traces and forget names
Already grasps its wonder—
Yet fearing stagnation in wonder,
One forgets it again—
Thus, both root and trace are forgotten.
Again forgetting this intention,
The spirit merges with the Dao.

Having dispelled desire,
Even non-desire is forgotten—
Not clinging to being or non-being,
Not fixating on the middle path—
This is the complete forgetting.

The gateway to all wonders is the Heavenly Gate.
The Heavenly Gate is the total name for the origin of all dharma.
Without being—
It speaks of all things emerging from non-being,
Returning to non-being—
Gathering and dispersing, concealing and revealing—
Thus, they are transient guests of coming and going.

Empty in name, yet no true gate exists—
Thus, it is called the gate of non-doing.

Then, there is no gate—
No gate means no sides—
Four-way openness, vast and boundless—
This is returning to the wondrous Dao.

**True observation** is the gradual path of cultivation,
The stages of verifying the Dao.

The earlier "seen with the eyes" is the observation of surveying.
The "illuminated by the spirit" is the observation of practice.

The Dao also employs the Three Vehicles’ methods to transform people,
From initial awakening to ultimate attainment—
Abandoning the mundane to realize the sacred—
Thus, there are fourteen stages of observation and practice.

The Small Vehicle’s initial gate has three observations:
First, the **observation of provisional dharma**—oppositional discernment.
Second, the **observation of true dharma**—illumination of the mind.
Third, the **observation of pervasive emptiness**—entering non-doing.

The Middle Vehicle’s gate of observation and practice has four:
First, the observation of **impermanence**,
Second, the observation of **eternity**,
Third, the observation of **non-impermanence**,
Fourth, the observation of **non-eternity**.

The Great Vehicle’s gate of observation and practice also has four:
First, the **observation of wondrous being**,
Second, the **observation of wondrous non-being**,
Third, the **observation of profound mystery**,
Fourth, the **observation of non-profound mystery**.

The Sacred Practice gate further has three observations:
First, the **observation of true emptiness**,
Second, the **observation of true penetration**,
Third, the **observation of true non-being**.

Through these observations and practices,
One refines the mind—
From being to non-being,
From coarse to wondrous—
Attaining wonder and forgetting it,
Thus resonating with the gate of non-doing.

Non-doing and doing—
The Dao can be spoken of as constant Dao,
Body and function held together—
Its principle is clear.

Now, within the gate of body and function,
It is divided into five distinctions:
First, **non-doing as body, doing as function**—
The Dao as body is without,
Names as function are with.
Second, **doing as body, non-doing as function**—
Houses, carriages, tools—
Their doing is body,
Their non-doing is function—
Utilizing their non-being.
Third, **non-doing as body, non-doing as function**—
Naturalness as body,
Conditional relations as function—
All are non-being.
Fourth, **doing as body, doing as function**—
Heaven and Earth as body,
All things as function—
All are being.
Fifth, **neither being nor non-being as body,
Neither being nor non-being as function**—
The Dao as body,
Virtue/power as function.

Again, within the gate of root and trace,
It is divided into two distinctions:
**Non-being as root, being as trace**—
Non-naming and naming.
**Being as root, non-being as trace**—
Mutual illumination.

All things originate from being yet ultimately return to non-being.

From the mysterious source, pure and silent,
The wondrous root, distant and obscure—
Not sought through words or symbols,
Not verified through being or non-being—
Indeed, debate on principles is exhausted,
Speculation on the Dao is at its end—
Yet teachings are set forth to guide the mundane,
Demonstrating these stages.
Yet it lies in the silent heart’s resonance,
Gradual or sudden, adapting to each case—
Do not cling to teachings or fixate on words,
Be not bound by scholarly conventions.
Those who bathe their hearts in virtue and power,
Strive diligently.

The Lord of the Dao says:
*The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao.*

Without beginning, it is called the Dao—
Unspeakable, yet to speak of it is false.
Again it says:
*The Dao should not be named,*
*Yet the speakable and nameable Dao*
*Is like things, like the four seasons—*
*Appropriate when it should be.*

Rising and declining in succession,
This is not true constancy.
Constant Dao, constant name—
From its own root, its own foundation—
Before Heaven and Earth existed,
It has eternally endured.

Fu Xi obtained it to inherit the **Qi of the Mother**,
The Western Queen Mother attained it and sat in **Minor Broadness**—
No one knows its beginning,
No one knows its end.

The Nameless is the Mother of ten thousand things.
The Dao is ever nameless—
Heaven and Earth await it to give birth,
As Zhuangzi says: *"It gives birth to Heaven and Earth."*

Before Heaven and Earth existed,
Who could name it?
Thus, it is nameless—
The beginning of Heaven and Earth.

Only after Heaven and Earth came into being
Did ten thousand things arise,
Thus it is named—
The Mother of ten thousand things.

Constantly without desire,
One observes its limits.

Zhuangzi says:
*"Establish it with constant non-being.*
*Not establishing any thing—*
This is called constant non-being;
*Not abandoning any thing—*
This is called constant being.

Constant non-being is in principle—
Its upper reaches are unfathomable,
The utmost subtlety under Heaven,
Thus one observes its marvel.

Constant being in the world—
Its lower reaches are not obscured,
The utmost transformation under Heaven,
Thus one observes its limits.

The two realms of being and non-being,
Within them lies subtle mystery.
Great wisdom observes both together,
And thus nothing is unattainable.

Within vague and indistinct,
There are forms and things.
Small wisdom is self-serving,
Obscured by one-sidedness,
Clinging to being while rejecting emptiness,
Pursuing the superficial while forgetting the root—
Thus Dao/Way and its arts are shattered for all under Heaven.

These two—when most alike—are called *Xuan* (the Mysterious).
The Dao originally has no form—
Who would speak of its marvels?
Things and I share the same root—
This is called *one qi*,
Thus it is called *Xuan*.

The confused of the world
Abandon illusion to seek truth,
Yet the farther they stray from truth,
Not knowing that what is called "thing"
Is merely a difference in names.

*Xuan* again *Xuan*—
The gate of all marvels.

*The Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* says:
*"Xuan gives birth to spirit."*
*The I Ching* says:
*"Spirit—*
*This is the subtle speech of all things."*

Small yet marvelous—this is *Xuan*.
*Xuan*—the color of Heaven.
Though the colored is manifest,
The coloring itself never reaches completion.

*Xuan* again *Xuan*—
This is called "coloring."

The subtle principle of *Xuan*
Is possessed by all things.
Heaven’s movement,
Earth’s resting,
Human aliveness,
The flourishing of ages—
All are marvels,
Yet all emerge from *Xuan*,
Thus it is called the gate of all marvels.

Confucius composed the *I Ching* down to *The Sayings on the Trigrams*
Before speaking of marvels.
While Laozi begins with this in his first chapter.
The words of the sages complement each other’s end and beginning.

Wang Anshi said:
*"The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao."*
Constant—Zhuangzi says—
Is without past or future,
Without end or beginning.
The Dao originally cannot be spoken of,
Yet if it can be spoken of,
Then it is its progression.
If it has boundaries,
Then it is not my eternal Dao.

The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
The Dao originally has no name,
Yet if it has a name,
Then it is not my eternal name.
Names arise from meaning,
Thus there are names.

The Nameless is the Mother of ten thousand things.
Non-being names the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
Being names its end.
Thus it is called the Mother of ten thousand things.

*The Complete Meaning* says:
Non-being is above form.
From the Great Beginning to the Great Initiation,
From the Great Initiation to the Great Polarity,
The Great Initiation gives birth to Heaven and Earth—
This is named the beginning of Heaven and Earth.

Being is below form.
Only after Heaven and Earth did ten thousand things arise—
This is named the Mother of ten thousand things,
For *mother* means *to give birth*.

*The Main Explanation* says:
The Nameless is the Great Initiation,
Thus it is the Father of Heaven and Earth.
The Named is the Great Polarity,
Thus it is the Mother of ten thousand things.

Heaven and Earth are the union of ten thousand things;
Ten thousand things are the separation of Heaven and Earth.
Speaking of the Father as Heaven and Earth,
Then ten thousand things become known.
Speaking of the Mother as ten thousand things,
Then Heaven and Earth also become known.

Constantly without desire,
One observes its limits.

The origin of the Dao lies in non-being,
Thus constant non-being observes its marvel.
The function of the Dao returns to being,
Thus constant being observes its limits.

These two are called *Xuan*.
*Xuan* again *Xuan*—
The gate of all marvels.

For one cannot constantly remain in non-being,
Without which one cannot observe its marvel.
One cannot constantly remain in being,
Without which one cannot observe its limits.
To observe its marvel and its limits,
One knows that being and non-being
Emerge from the same *Xuan*.

*The Complete Meaning* says:
The Dao is one,
Yet its explanations are two.
What are these two?
Being and non-being.
Non-being is the origin of the Dao,
And what is called *marvel*.
Being is the end of the Dao,
And what is called *limits*.

Thus the origin of the Dao lies in the boundless and obscure,
While its end disperses into forms, names, and measurements.
These two—though one Dao—
The confused of the world often regard as separate.
Why?
Boundless and obscure constantly abide in non-being,
While forms, names, and measurements constantly abide in being.
Being and non-being cannot coexist.
This is why they are obscured and cannot preserve themselves.

Non-being names the beginning of Heaven and Earth,
While being names the Mother of ten thousand things—
Though their names differ,
They never fail to serve each other.
Being and non-being,
Like east and west in opposition,
Yet cannot negate each other.
Without being, there is no way to perceive non-being,
And without non-being, there is no way to produce being.
The transformations of being and non-being
Alternate and interweave,
Yet never depart from the Dao.
This is what the sages call *spirit*.

*The I Ching* says:
*"Without thought,
Without action,
Silent and unmoving,
Yet responding and thus communicating*
*the principles of all under Heaven."*

This is what is spoken of.

Truly, the sages of old would always observe its subtlety through their *wu si wu wei* [non-thinking, non-action],
and always perceive its manifestations through *gan er sui tong tianxia zhi gu* [responding and thus communicating the principles of all under Heaven].
When both subtlety and manifestations are attained without partiality,
who but the most divine could partake in this?

Thus, the Dao of the sages is now evident.
To observe its subtlety is to exhaust the divine;
to observe its manifestations is to know transformation.
When the divine is exhausted and transformation is known,
what more can be added to the Dao of Heaven and Earth?
These two are called *xuan* [profound] when brought to their utmost.

These two—
the Dao of being and non-being—
both originate from the Dao.
It speaks of how the essence and function of being and non-being
all emerge from the Dao.
Scholars of the world often regard non-being as refined and being as coarse,
yet they do not know that both arise from the Dao,
hence they are called *xuan* when spoken of together.

These two, though differing in name,
originate from the same source—*shen* [divine]—
yet differ in their names: being and non-being.
The sage embodies this,
thus manifesting divine virtue.
Hence, abiding in non-being suffices to perceive its subtlety;
abiding in being suffices to know its manifestations.
Yet ultimately, it transcends the names of being and non-being.

The highest insight knows the origin of Heaven and Earth,
while the lowest suffices to govern the order of all things—
all through this.

*The Zishuo* [Explanation of Characters] says:
*"Covered and entering—this is *xuan* [profound].*
Thus, *xuan* is composed of *xu* [cover] and *ru* [enter].
These two are called *xuan* together.
These two refer to being and non-being.

*Xuan* is also black, yet bears a red hue.
The north is black as yin, yet *xuan* is yang.
Thus, the *I Ching* says:
*'Kun on Earth is black.'*
And again:
*'Heaven is *xuan*, Earth is yellow.'*
Shun spoke of *xuan de* [profound virtue],
referring to its depth in the sage below.

Su Yingbin said:
*'The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.
Yet all that can be spoken of is not the Dao—
only what cannot be spoken of can be constant.*
Now, *ren* [benevolence], *yi* [righteousness], *li* [rites], and *zhi* [wisdom]
are the Dao that can be spoken of.
Yet benevolence cannot be made righteousness,
nor rites made wisdom.
What can be spoken of cannot be constant in this way.
Only what cannot be spoken of
allows *ren* to remain *ren*,
*yi* to remain *yi*,
*li* to remain *li*,
and *zhi* to remain *zhi*—
though all these are not constant,
the Dao remains unchanging and unalterable.
What cannot be spoken of alone can be constant in this way.

What can be named is not the constant name.
The Dao cannot be spoken of—
how much less can it be named?
All names are of what can be spoken of.
Once names are established,
the distinctions of round and square, curved and straight
cannot remain constant.

Non-being names the beginning of Heaven and Earth,
until one observes its *jiao* [manifestations].
From its nameless form, Heaven and Earth arise,
and once positioned, names begin to establish themselves.
From its named propagation, ten thousand things emerge,
and as they flourish, names become innumerable.
Thus, the nameless is the essence of the Dao,
while the named is its function.

The sage embodies the Dao for the world’s use,
entering all things while remaining constantly non-being,
to observe its subtlety;
embodying the utmost non-being while remaining constantly being,
to observe its manifestations.
If one acts only in its manifestations without knowing its subtlety,
it is coarse and not divine.
If one lingers only in its subtlety without knowing its manifestations,
it is refined yet not comprehensive.

These two, when brought to their utmost, are called *xuan*.
Speaking in terms of form,
being and non-being are indeed two—
how can one know that non-being transforms into being,
and being returns to non-being,
yet they are never separate?
Though their names differ,
their origin is one.
Knowing their origin as one,
this is *xuan*.

All that is distant without limit
must be of a *xuan* hue,
thus Laozi often used *xuan* to convey the extreme.
*Xuan* beyond *xuan*—
the gateway to all subtleties.
Speaking of *xuan* is to reach it,
yet still the mind of *xuan* remains.
*Xuan* beyond *xuan* is exhausted—
nothing more can be added—
the source from which all subtleties emerge.

Lü Jifu said:
*The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.*
All the Dao under Heaven that can be spoken of
is not the Dao—
yet at times it is perilous, hence not the constant Dao.
All names under Heaven that can be named
are not the constant name—
ten thousand things, each returning to their root,
returning to the root is called *jing* [stillness],
stillness is called *fu ming* [restoring life],
restoring life is called *chang* [constant].
When the Dao reaches constancy,
the mind solidifies, the form relaxes,
and self and objects are forgotten.
Who can know the Dao that can be spoken of,
or the names that can be named?

Thus, the constant Dao is indeed unspeakable.
Hence it is said: *The Dao endures long, yet does not perish with life.*
The constant name is indeed unnameable.
Hence it is said: *From ancient times to today, its name does not fade.*

Not perishing, not fading—
this is called the constant Dao.
Non-being is the Mother of ten thousand things.
Constant non-being is the Dao itself,
and the origin from which Heaven and Earth begin,
hence it is said: *Non-being names the beginning of Heaven and Earth.*

At the *Tai Chu* [Great Origin], there was being and non-being,
yet non-being had no name.
Being and non-being—
even one cannot be named with being and non-being,
for the origin of one, though not yet formed, already exists.
Once called *one*,
though not yet formed, it already has a name.
The name *one* is one,
yet the one who names is two—
two and one make three,
and from here ten thousand things arise in confusion.
Thus it is said: *The named is the Mother of ten thousand things.*

Constant non-being reaches the observation of its manifestations.
Knowing constancy is called *ming* [clarity],
and clarity sees all things.
Thus, only constancy can be observed—
when desireless, it purifies and gazes profoundly,
with no flaw in observing its subtlety,
hence it is said: *Constant non-desire can be named as small.*
When desire arises,
ten thousand things act together,
and all things return to it,
yet the master remains unknown—
this can be named as great.

The two, when most harmonized, are called *Xuan* [Mysterious].
Only the small reveals its subtlety (*miao*), only the great reveals its manifestations (*jiao*).
Though their origins are the same, their names differ—
and though their names differ, their essence never truly does.
For whether with desire or without, seeking their origin,
one finds nothing—
nothing to find means their origin is the same,
thus they are called *Xuan*.

As to *Xuan*’s hue,
black and red are one in unity.
The sky’s hue is *Xuan*—
yin and yang are one in unity.
Unity in oneness is indeed subtle.
Yet subtle in oneness is not yet subtle in multiplicity;
subtle in self is not yet subtle in things.
The gate to *Xuan*’s utmost.

*Xuan* again *Xuan*—
then even the same is unattainable.
If the same is unattainable,
then oneness and multiplicity, self and things—
all are without fail subtle.
The subtlety of ten thousand things arises from this alone.

Master Lu said:
*The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.*
The constant name has *wu-fang* [boundlessness] as its essence,
the constant Dao has *wu-ti* [formlessness] as its function.
Boundlessness is nowhere absent,
formlessness does nothing it omits—
if there is anything that can be spoken of, it is not boundlessness;
if there is anything that can be named, it is not formlessness.
The unnamed is the Mother of ten thousand things.
At the *Tai-ch’i* [Supreme Polarity], there is *wu* [non-being],
and *wu* has no name.
The unnamed is *Tai-shih* [Great Beginning],
the Great Beginning is the parent of heaven and earth.
Thus it is said: *The unnamed is the beginning of heaven and earth.*
Heaven and earth are the Mother of ten thousand things.
Thus it is said: *The named is the Mother of ten thousand things.*
Speak of Mother and you know the Beginning as Father;
speak of Beginning and you know the Mother as Sovereign.
Thus above it speaks of the beginning of heaven and earth,
below it speaks of the Mother of ten thousand things.
Constant non-desire reaches the observation of its manifestations.
*Miao* is the origin of the Dao,
*Jiao* is the end of the Dao.
The Sage, regarding *miao*, observes with constant non-desire;
the Sage, regarding *jiao*, observes with constant having.
*Miao* lies within, *su* [coarse] lies at the end—
speak of *miao* and you know *jiao* as coarse,
speak of *jiao* and you know *miao* as central.
Thus above it speaks of desire to observe *miao*,
below it speaks of desire to observe *jiao*.
The two, when most harmonized, are *Xuan*.

The *wu* [non-being] that opposes *you* [being] is not the *wu* of constant non-being,
and constant non-being is not the *wu* that opposes *you*.
The *you* that opposes *wu* is not the *you* of constant having,
and constant having is not the *you* that opposes *wu*.
That which does not oppose *wu* is not *you*,
that which does not oppose *you* is not *wu*.
Thus constant non-being is true non-being, yet not *wu*;
constant having is subtle being, yet not *you*.
Hence the two arise from the same source,
and thus they are called *Xuan*.
The gate to *Xuan*’s utmost.

*Xuan* is the essence of subtlety,
subtlety is the function of *Xuan*.
When the Dao reaches *Xuan*’s utmost,
humans become the gate to all subtleties,
entering and exiting between them.
Zhuangzi said:
*The sky’s opening is not the opening of human sky.*
The sky’s opening is natural;
the human sky is contrived.
*Xuan* again *Xuan*—
this is Zhuangzi’s *precise of the precise*.
The gate to all subtleties—
this is Zhuangzi’s *divine of the divine*.

Master Wang Yuanze said:
*The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.*
The Dao is the path of ten thousand things—
in essence, it is essence;
in function, it is function.
Without name, without progression,
it is nowhere absent.
Thus the Sage’s words always dwell in one aspect,
though dwelling in one aspect,
they differ from the myriad schools of thought,
yet do not lose principle or conform to the times.
The Dao that can be spoken of adapts to the times and acts accordingly;
times shift without pause,
and the Dao responds to change.
For creation subtly moves,
never ceasing for an instant—
thus today is not yesterday.
Yet petty scholars grasp brilliance as the Dao’s root,
pointing to the *Zhun Lu* [a legendary dwelling] as the Sage’s abode.
Laozi was about to loosen their obstructions,
and questioned them with ultimate truth.
Thus this opening chapter clarifies this,
so that even today’s words are not constant.

The name that can be named is not the constant name.
Names arise from reality,
and reality has form and number—
once form and number are complete,
decay follows inevitably.
How can it be constant?
Only by embodying the unconstant is true constancy attained.
The unnamed is the Mother of the utmost.

Receiving command from non-being,
it takes form in being—
thus it is said: *the beginning of heaven and earth, the Mother of ten thousand things.*
The *Yijing* says:
*Only after heaven and earth did ten thousand things arise.*
This aligns with the *Yijing*’s sequence.
Between the covering and the loading,
life emerges—
thus heaven and earth are spoken of first.
Things and heaven and earth originally have no precedence,
pushed to their extreme, being and non-being are one essence—
the speech of Beginning and Mother is also a metaphor.

Though heaven and earth are vast,
they receive command and take form,
never truly separate from being and non-being.
Yet it speaks solely of the Mother of ten thousand things—
thus Laozi’s words merely exhaust nature’s essence.

Constant non-desire reaches the observation of its manifestations.
The *Yijing*’s yin and yang,
Laozi’s being and non-being,
even to the Buddha’s *color and emptiness*—
their essence is one, differing only in exposition.
Those who speak of non-being,
abandoning being to seek non-being,
are but adding another being beyond being—
how can this be non-being?
Thus when there is a time of reality,
it is not truly non-being—
this is true non-being.
The essence of being and non-being is always one,
but when observing with being,
one only sees its surface—
to observe its subtlety,
one must know its original non-being,
yet the non-being of non-being never truly departs from being.
Speaking of constant non-being and constant having,
it is because the names of being and non-being do not succeed one another—
non-being is true being,
being is true non-being.
Speak of *jiao* and you know *miao* as profound,
speak of *miao* and you know *jiao* as coarse.
This is the essence of the law’s speech.
Called *Xuan* because they are one.
Being and non-being originally are one,
before the two names arose.
Learners, if they rush in,
will find non-being not as precise as being.

Once the Dao is attained,
both being and non-being become perfect truths,
with no distinction between them.

This is the gateway to all subtleties.
The Dao contains two essences:
when descending to form, Yang is exalted while Yin is humble;
when ascending beyond form, Yin precedes while Yang follows.

Thus, when the Dao reaches its utmost, it is called *miao* and *xuan*.
*Miao* refers to **virtue/power**,
*Xuan* to **essence/color**.
Speaking of essence, one attains the Dao.
Yet there remains what essence cannot encompass,
hence it is also called *xuan*.
All things possess their subtleties,
all arising from this,
so it is called the **gateway to all subtleties**.

The Dao is one,
yet is spoken of as two.
What is meant by these two?
It is being and non-being.
Non-being is the Dao’s origin,
while *miao* is the subtlety.
Being is the Dao’s culmination,
while *jiao* is the coarse.
Thus, the Dao’s origin emerges from the **boundless void**,
while its culmination disperses among forms, names, and measures.

These two, though one in Dao,
are often mistaken as separate by the world.
Why?
Because the **boundless void** abides in non-being,
while forms, names, and measures dwell in being.
Being and non-being cannot coexist,
and this is why they are obscured and not fully grasped.

The unnamed is the beginning of Heaven and Earth,
while the named is the mother of all things.
Though they differ in name,
they never fail to serve one another.

Being and non-being, like east and west,
are opposites yet cannot negate one another.
Thus, without being, there is no way to perceive non-being,
and without non-being, there is no way to manifest being.
The transformations of being and non-being
alternate and interweave without ever departing from the Dao—
this is what the sages call **divine**.

The *Yijing* says:
*"No thought, no action—*
*still and motionless,*
*yet responsive and thus harmonizing*
*with the workings of Heaven and Earth."*

This is what is meant.

The sages of old
observed the **constant subtlety** through their **thoughtless stillness**,
and the **coarse transformations** through their **responsive harmony**.
When both the coarse and the subtle are attained without preference,
who else but the divine could achieve this?

Thus, the sages’ Dao is also evident.
Observing the subtle exhausts the divine,
while observing the coarse reveals its **manifestations**.
To exhaust the divine and know its manifestations,
what more could be added to the Dao of Heaven and Earth?

Still, observing the subtle is only to exhaust the divine,
not to define it.
For the divine never departs from these two,
yet these two cannot fully name it.
Hence it is said:
*"Both arise from the same source yet differ in name.
The same is that they arise from the divine;
the different is that being and non-being have distinct names."*

The sage
embodies this and manifests its divine virtue,
so abiding in non-being reveals the subtle,
while dwelling in being discerns the coarse.
Yet ultimately, they transcend the names of being and non-being.

Below the sage, some grasp Heaven and Earth’s origin,
while others apply themselves to governing all things—
all rely on this.

Ah! The words of Laozi can be said to accord with the *Yijing*.
Yet they ultimately do not align with Confucius and Mencius.
Why?
For the sage never sought to speak of the Dao.
All speech arises from responding to the world’s transformations,
and is meant for those of middling talent who cannot fathom it on their own.

Though the Dao encompasses both being and non-being,
when spoken of, it elaborates on being while neglecting non-being.
The texts of *Shijing*, *Shujing*, *Liji*, *Yuelü*, and *Chunqiu*
all serve to clarify being,
while regarding non-being, only the *Yijing* speaks of it.

Yet even its discourse
must be embedded in the **hexagrams, trigrams, symbols, and systems**,
in **auspicious and inauspicious**,
**regret and blame**,
so that scholars, when observing from above, see its meticulous attention to affairs and things,
and grasp its **manifested being**;
when observing from below, they perceive its transcendence of instruments and utility,
and attain its **original non-being**.

Thus, the worthy study it and grow ever more confident,
while the foolish glance at it and are not led to doubt or lose their way.

For their minds ponder:
*"That Dao of subtlety—*
*the middling talents cannot reach it,*
*and those who can reach it*
*would not need words to explain it.*
If one does not measure it thus,
and insists on speaking only of subtlety,
then one leaves learners seated in confusion."*

Laozi understood the interplay of being and non-being,
and thus regarded non-being as the origin,
so his words elaborate on non-being while neglecting being.
Non-being requires no words,
yet he could speak elaborately of it.

Laozi, differing from Confucius and Mencius,
and Wang Bi losing the intent of Confucius—
for his teaching holds that the **unnamed** is the beginning of Heaven and Earth,
yet the **divine** is what Heaven and Earth most struggle to name.
Once the world has named it as divine,
how could there be anything unnamed?

Again, Wang Bi asserts that one must observe through **constant desire** to see the coarse.
But desire is the **harm to nature**—
the *Yijing* says: *"Restrain anger, suppress desire,"*
and Laozi says: *"Do not see what can be desired,
so the heart remains undisturbed."*
If desire exists,
how much more will one be **drowned in it, turned aside, lose oneself in pursuit of things,**
and fail to know what to hold fast to?
Then how could one observe the coarse?

This failure to discern
leads him to say, *"I know the fullness of Heaven and Earth,
the great framework of the ancients."*
Alas, how laughable!

Liu Zhongping said:
*"The Dao that can be spoken of is the mother of the Dao that cannot be spoken of."*

The **Taiji** depends upon the Dao.
Heaven and Earth depend upon the myriad things.
The myriad things depend upon Heaven and Earth.

What depends upon something is not the Dao itself—
it is the accumulation of the Dao.

The Dao is **absolute non-being**, yet nameless.
**Taiji** is **non-being**, yet nameless when detached from it.
Heaven and Earth are **being**, yet named when entered.

**Taiji** is obscure and divine—
its name cannot be grasped—
this is the subtlety of the Dao.

Heaven and Earth manifest in forms—
their names can be carried—
this is the coarse of the Dao.

Both arise from speech.
The one who is **constantly without desire** observes it and sees only its subtlety.
The one who is **constantly with desire** observes it and sees only its coarse.

Only the one who is constantly without desire
can penetrate to the **mystic**.

Some say: *"This is not what is meant."*
They say that **non-being** names the beginning of Heaven and Earth,
while **being** names the mother of the myriad things.
They say that **constant non-being** is to observe its subtlety,
while **constant being** is to observe its coarse.

I say: *"No. The reader errs."*
If **being** can name the mother of the myriad things,
how can **non-being** name the beginning of Heaven and Earth?
If **constant being** can observe its coarse,
how can **constant non-being** merely observe its subtlety?

For there is a beginning, there is an end—
yet it cannot be called **non-being**.
**Constant non-being** reaches **absolute non-being**—
yet it cannot be called **being**.

Ah! To know this is to know the **mystic**.

**Constant non-desire** is the gateway to the Dao.
**Constant non-being, constant being**—
speaking of **being** and **non-being** in interplay,
one cannot take one side without the other.

**Constant non-being** seeks to observe the Dao’s subtlety,
**constant being** seeks to observe its coarse.
Subtlety speaks of the root; coarse speaks of the branch.
Only when both root and branch are observed
does one see the Dao.

The **constant name** has **no form** as its essence,
the **constant Dao** has **no essence** as its function.
**No form** means it is nowhere absent,
**no essence** means it does nothing absent.
If **no form** had anything that could be spoken of,
it would not be **no form**.
If **no essence** had anything that could be named,
it would not be **no essence**.
Thus it is said:
*The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao,*
*The name that can be named is not the constant name.*

**Tai’chu** has **being** and **non-being**—
**non-being** has **non-being**, yet is nameless.
**Non-being** that is nameless—this is **Taishǐ**.

**Taishǐ** is the father of Heaven and Earth,
thus it is called the **nameless beginning of Heaven and Earth**.
Heaven and Earth are the mother of the myriad things,
thus it is called the **named mother of the myriad things**.

Speaking of the mother, one knows the beginning as father;
speaking of the beginning, one knows the mother as origin.
Thus it is said above: *"the beginning of Heaven and Earth,"*
and below: *"the mother of the myriad things."*

Yet the principles of the world have
the Dao and the **constant Dao**,
names and the **constant name**.

What is called **Tai’chu** having **being** and **non-being**—
it is **non-being** alone.
What is called **non-being** that is nameless—
it is **name** alone.
For **being** and **non-being** give rise to the **name of name**,
thus the **nameless** is only the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
And above this, there is the **Ancestor**.

Subtlety is the root of the Dao;
coarse is the branch of the Dao.
The sage’s subtlety is observed through **constant non-being**.
The sage’s coarse is observed through **constant being**.
Thus it is said:
*"Observe its subtlety with constant non-desire,
observe its coarse with constant desire."*

Subtlety lies within; coarse lies in the branch.
Speaking of subtlety reveals the coarse as coarse,
speaking of the coarse reveals the subtlety as central.
Thus it is said above: *"observe its subtlety,"*
and below: *"observe its coarse."*

For **non-being** is **non-being** opposed to **being**,
while **constant non-being** is not **non-being** opposed to **being**,
nor is it opposed to **being**.

**Being** is **being** opposed to **non-being**,
while **constant being** is not **being** opposed to **non-being**,
nor is it opposed to **non-being**.

What is not opposed to **non-being** is not **being**,
what is not opposed to **being** is not **non-being**.
Thus **constant being** is **true non-being**—
yet not **non-being**.
**Constant being** is **subtle being**—
yet not **being**.

Thus these two arise together and return to the **mystic**.

Zhuangzi said:
*"Establish it with **constant non-being**,
speak of it with **Tai’yi**."*

This is read as **constant non-being, constant being**.
**Constant non-being** seeks to observe its subtlety,
**constant being** seeks to observe its coarse.
Because it seeks to observe its subtlety,
it is established with **constant non-being**.
Because it seeks to observe its coarse,
it is established with **constant being**.

If both coarse and subtlety are forgotten,
and there is no desire to observe,
then what is called *"established with constant non-being"*
is simply **obscured**.

This is called **the mystic again**—
not merely the same as the **mystic**.
*The mystic, the mystic again*—
the gateway of all subtleties.

The **mystic** is the essence of subtlety;
subtlety is the function of the **mystic**.
Subtlety arises from what is not the **mystic**.

Liu Jujie said:
*"The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao."*
The Dao meets speech—
then its being the Dao is enough, yet it is not the **constant Dao**.
The **constant Dao** has no limits—
this is what is called **constant non-desire**.
The Dao has no limits—
this is what is called **constant desire**.

When the world’s Dao is lost,
Laozi governs the One to save it—
its adaptation to things is appropriate,
not clinging to the old,
to harmonize the world’s transformations.

The name that can be named is not the **constant name**—
if forced to name it, call it **Great**,
then this name is **Great**.
**Great** is a name; **Dao** is a character.
The **constant name** has no limits—
no limits mean no name.
The name that can be named has no limits—
no limits mean it has a name.

The **mystic** of name and character—
is it not here?

The **nameless** is the mother of the **Dao that cannot be spoken of**.
This speaks only of name, not of Dao.
Since name extends to character,
the **nameless** is also seen.

Heaven and Earth’s beginning—
vastly obscure and unified—
then where are the so-called name and character?

Once names and characters exist,
then adaptation to things is appropriate—
things arise from what is appropriate,
and from what is appropriate comes what is possible,
until what is possible becomes what is actual.
Thus, the Dao is the mother of all things.

**Constantly without desire**, one observes its **boundaries**.
**Constantly without desire** is the same as the **constant Dao**;
**constantly with desire** is the same as the **possible Dao**.

When one is in **constant impossibility**, it is called **constant without desire**;
when one is in **constant possibility**, it is called **constant with desire**.

For the text below speaks of **constant without name** but not **constant without desire**,
speaks of **my without desire** but not **desire without desire**—
desire, if it exists, is never **constant**.

To observe the **mystic** through **constant without desire**,
that is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;
to observe the **boundaries** through **constant with desire**,
that is the mother of all things.

What is called **observation** is the mind’s eye,
not merely the force of sight.

These two are called **mystic**.
**Without desire** and **with desire**—
though their names differ,
their essence arises from the same Dao.
For **impossibility** and **constant** are both the Dao.

**Mystic**—
obscure, dim, profound, and boundless—
is the hue of the Dao.
The Yellow Emperor said:
In Heaven, it is **mystic**; in humans, it is **Dao**.

The Dao, when seen, is unseen yet has hue—
the Sage observes its **mystic** and its **boundaries**,
and thus speaks of it.

When called the same, it is **mystic**;
**mystic**, it can be spoken of—
the **constant Dao** and the **possible Dao** depend on each other.

**Mystic beyond mystic**—
the gateway to all **wonders**.

Again, **mystic**—
form and hue are not hue;
nothing can be observed of it.

**Mystic of mystic** and **again mystic of mystic**—
not hue, yet they depend on each other,
not discarding the earlier **mystic** as a burden.

**All wonders**—
the **wonders** of all things.
All things possess **wonders**, all arising from the Dao—
thus, the Dao is the **wonder** of all things.

Here, **boundaries** are not mentioned,
for **wonders** and **boundaries** are not discarded as burdens.

Liu Ji said:
The Dao that can be spoken of is the gateway to what can be attained.
**Dao** speaks of its **body**; **name** speaks of its **function**.

What can be spoken of and named
is like the myriad schools and arts—
each has its strengths, its uses in time,
yet does not encompass all;
it is not the **true constant**.

Speaking of **constant Dao** and **constant name**—
self-originating, self-rooted—
before Heaven and Earth existed,
it has eternally endured.
The divine and spirits, the divine and emperors,
those who give birth to Heaven and Earth—
who can know the **Dao that can be spoken of**,
the **name that can be named**?

The Classic says:
The Great Dao is formless,
giving birth to Heaven and Earth.
Before Heaven and Earth existed,
who could name it?
Thus, it is **nameless**, the beginning of Heaven and Earth.

The Classic says:
The Great Dao is **nameless**, yet nourishes all things.
When all things exist,
there are forms that can be named—
thus, there is **name**, the mother of all things.

**Nameless** is the **mystic** of the Dao—
without action, without form,
thus **constant without desire** to observe its **mystic**.

**Named** is the **boundaries** of the Dao—
with emotion, with sincerity,
thus **constant with desire** to observe its **boundaries**.

The scholar must enter **without** from **with**,
unwinding to reach **mystic**,
seeking origin and end—
never truly different.

Thus, emerging with different names,
yet called the same—**mystic**.

**Mystic**—
the hue of Heaven,
that which is distant without limit.

**Mystic beyond mystic**—
then the divine beyond the divine,
profound beyond the profound,
entering the gate of the boundless,
wandering in the wild of the limitless,
matching the function of the void—
all **wonders** arise from this.

Thus, it is called the **gateway to all wonders**,
the source of all things,
the dependence of transformation.

Who can exit without passing through the door?
How could one not pass through this Dao?

The people can be led by it,
but cannot be made to know it.
Knowledge is shallow;
ignorance is profound.
Knowledge is external;
ignorance is internal—
thus, it follows with *all under Heaven know*.

*End of Volume One of the Collected Meanings of the Dao-De Jing*
*Beginning of Volume Two of the Collected Meanings of the Dao-De Jing*

**The Dao That Can Be Spoken of**

Master Zhi of the Concentrated Dao declares:
*"The Way of Eternal Virtue is a Mystic Vision."*

**Chapter on the Dao That Can Be Spoken of**
Zhao Shizhan says:

1. **Transcending Form to Manifest the True**
   The Dao that can be spoken of is not the Eternal Dao.
   The Dao that can be spoken of is the realm of *form and lower things*.
   The Eternal Dao is the realm of *formless and higher things*.

   In the realm of *form and lower things*, the Dao is dispersed among shapes, names, measures, and calculations.
   In the realm of *formless and higher things*, the Dao is concealed in the void, emptiness, stillness, and boundlessness.

   If one seeks the Dao through objects, the Dao cannot be grasped—
   for its inability to be grasped, forms and instruments are not the Dao.
   If one observes the Dao apart from objects, the Dao has no fixed attributes—
   for its lack of fixed attributes, its divine mysteries are boundless.

   The heart is the substance of the Dao;
   the Dao and the heart are not distinct.
   Nature is the origin of the heart;
   the heart and nature are not different.
   The heart and nature—
   the formless in form.
   The Dao and the heart—
   the formless yet manifest.

   The heart, nature, and Dao—
   though spoken as three, they are one.
   Being, non-being, and unity—
   though divided into three, they converge as one.

   One is said to be *numbers*—
   yet the Dao is not *numbers*!
   One is said to be *mystery*—
   yet the Dao is not separate from *numbers*!
   Mystery is formless—
   yet the Dao cannot be confined by words!

   Its manifestation is clarity;
   all things are without exception in the Dao.
   Thus, even the Dao that can be spoken of,
   though it may be spoken of, still holds the Eternal Dao within it.
   The Eternal Dao, though it transcends what can be spoken of,
   yet the Dao that can be spoken of is rooted in it.

   If one distinguishes between true and false in form,
   the true is the Eternal Dao,
   while the false is the Dao that can be spoken of.
   If one distinguishes between emptiness and reality,
   the Dao is the substance of true nature,
   while things are illusory manifestations.

   Let us illustrate with practical principles,
   perhaps this will yield some understanding.

   Though called *eternal*, change is inherent.
   Thus, when we speak of *eternal*,
   it refers to the realm of nature,
   the heart to the function of the Dao—
   together, they are called *eternal*.
   The substance of *eternal* is taken from its unchanging aspect;
   for its unchanging aspect, it is called *eternal*.
   From the Eternal Dao flow all things.

   Again, *eternal* is great—
   thus, when viewed from this perspective, is it not great?
   *Eternal* is the radiant function of the Sage.
   To speak of *eternal* is not to exclude the Dao;
   to speak of the Dao is not to exclude *eternal*—
   what is called *eternal* is the Dao,
   and the Dao is *eternal*.
   If one must speak of the Dao without mentioning *eternal*,
   how can the Eternal Dao be fixed as one?
   If one must speak of *eternal* without mentioning the Dao,
   how can the Dao be displayed in its fullness?

   *Eternal* abides eternally;
   the eternal abides in unchanging constancy.
   *Communicating* flows through all things;
   the communicating flows without end.

   One substance, two functions—
   yet one substance encompasses both change and constancy.
   Heaven is not eternal?
   The Nine Heavens reach their limit, yet Heaven sometimes alters.
   Earth is not eternal?
   The Six Directions reach their limit, yet Earth sometimes emerges.
   The sun is not eternal?
   It sometimes wanes.
   The moon is not eternal?
   It sometimes eclipses.

   The *Qian* (Heaven) above the Nine Heavens has no head,
   the *Peng* (Great Bird) rests only at the Sixth Month—
   thus, those who cling to form and *numbers* must have limits.
   Only the *eternal* has no form,
   no form means no *numbers*,
   no *numbers* means no generation,
   no generation means no annihilation.

   From Heaven and Earth down to all things,
   they are all of *form and numbers*—
   how could they be the same as my True Eternal Dao?

   Thus, it is said:
   The Dao that can be spoken of is not my Eternal Dao.

   Is *eternal* not change?
   To call it *eternal* without change—is that possible?
   Is change not *eternal*?
   To call it change without constancy—is that possible?

   When things are born,
   *eternal* is with them in their birth.
   When things transform,
   *eternal* is with them in their transformation.
   Born yet not born,
   *eternal* flows without obstruction.
   Transformed yet not transformed,
   *eternal* remains as it is.

   Self-born, self-transformed—
   without the True Eternal Dao, how could birth and transformation occur?
   Eternally born, eternally transformed—
   this is the True Eternal Dao, which ceaselessly generates and transforms.

   Flowing, dispersing, shifting—
   it does not cling to any fixed *eternal* state.
   Waning and waxing, full and empty—
   it does not adhere to any fixed principle,
   yet it encompasses all forms without being seen,
   abides in one nature eternally.
   Exhausted, it transforms;
   transformed, it flows.
   The great person adapts to the times through this.

   If useful, then follow;
   if not, then abandon—
   the Sage knows transformation through this.

   When applied to the world,
   it is called the *divine instrument*.
   When practiced for the benefit of all things,
   it is called *enlightened authority*.
   When pondered to its utmost elemental principle,
   it is called *subtle mystery*.
   When wielded in accordance with yin-yang,
   it is called *divine mechanism*.

   As for Yao’s use of it—*benevolence*;
   Shun’s use of it—*filial piety*;
   Yu’s use of it—*channeling the rivers and streams*;
   Tang’s use of it—*ascending to sage-like reverence*.
   Though their uses differ,
   their essence is one.

   Only those virtuous rulers who do not share the Sage’s concerns
   can truly embody the *eternal*—
   for they alone understand its substance.

2. **Transcending Names to Manifest Reality**
   Names can be named,
   yet they are not the Eternal Names.
   What can be named with names
   still has form.
   The Dao being formless,
   how could it be named?

   The *Classic* says: *Not the Eternal Name*.
   What can be named is not my Eternal Name—
   yet the Eternal also has a name.

   The Eternal is without generation;
   generation is matter—
   all matter can be named.
   The Eternal is without use;
   use is action—
   all actions can be named.
   Yet to investigate the origin of generation,
   the ancestor of all actions,
   one finds it cannot be seen.

   Liezi says:
   *"When the Dao is fully applied, it fills the six voids;
   when it is discarded, no one knows its whereabouts."*

   The Dao has unity and dispersion,
   nature has interaction and distinction—
   the formless unites with the formless,
   the formless enters the formless without obstruction.
   Its spirit soars like lightning,
   its motion is swift as a drawn arrow—
   how could one trace its path?

   This is the Dao that cannot be named.
   Thus, unity is oneness of substance.
   This unity is unity with the Great Void.

   Dispersion is the origin of all things;
   from the formless arises the form.
   The ungenerated can generate all things—
   vital essence contains *qi*, nurtures life—
   how could one be ignorant of this?

This dispersion is dispersion into myriad things to form shape—this can be named.
The Dao generates yang in the child [position], the child’s beauty appears in the southeast—thus the Dao emerges and interacts with things.
The Dao generates yin in the noon [position], the noon’s beauty exhausts in the northwest—this is the Dao’s return and its distinction of things.
When interacting with things, its manifestation is manifest—then the names of myriad things are naturally bestowed.
When distinguishing things, its concealment is concealed—then the origin of the One Truth is unseen.

To name the unseeable as the constant name, the nameable yet cannot be unified;
To name the seen as nameable, then the constant name also cannot be pursued.
Emerging from darkness and entering darkness—this supreme Dao is indeed mysterious.
Who names it? Who does not name it?

Next, dividing the two: having and not having.

**One: The Great Void originates One.**
Without name, the beginning of heaven and earth—with the Dao residing in the utmost void and profound obscurity,
deep as if eternally existing, not entangled with any thing.
All that has form are not the Dao’s constant Way.
Next, speaking of the non-constant name—since names exist between form, substance, and measure,
according to their beauty or ugliness, no thing lacks a name.
All that can be named are not the Dao’s constant name.
Without name, the beginning of heaven and earth.
With name, the mother of myriad things.
Earlier, speaking of the non-constant name—this means the constant has not departed from name.
Now speaking of the without-name—using the character *wu* (無) to break the constant character.
Without name, the beginning of heaven and earth.
The without-name is the constant Dao.
The constant Dao is the without-name.
Why speak of one principle in two ways?
Because the Dao cannot be spoken—those who speak of it never truly reach it.
The Dao originally has no name; those who name it never fully grasp its essence.
It must be spoken of as the non-constant constant—indeed, twofold speech.
The constant Dao and constant name—speaking of its ineffable without-name,
and speaking of its nameable use.

The without-name generates heaven and earth; the nameable begets myriad things—
all to display its function.
The essence of the supreme Dao is deep as the Great Void,
no thing generated, no name obtained—
at the utmost stillness, stillness generates motion,
thus the One *qi* unfurls like a brushstroke as the origin of things—
called "touching" yet not touching, called "responding" yet not responding,
rooted in void transformation, spirit generating *qi*.
The principle of generation unfolds here.
The Dao generates One; One is the beginning—
the spirit of myriad forms is thus evenly bestowed.
The "having" is not truly having—this is One yet unformed;
the "not having" is not truly not having—this is the initial form,
like the moon’s shadow in *guàn* (艮).
Like a trickle’s source, gradually forming heaven and earth—
who embodies transformation? This is the non-doing that does.
Now, the without-form is the marvelous—all laws return to rest;
the with-form is false—ordinary people taste it.
The Dao hidden is without use yet achieves use—
achieving use, *qi* comes first.
The law arises, using the law yet never exhausted—
the Original Beginning is boundless.
One, though falling into numbers, harmonizes with numbers—then eternal life.
The beginning has form; refining the form, one does not die.
Water one, fire two, wood three, metal four, earth five—
these are the generating numbers of the Five Phases.
Nine wood, three fire, seven metal, five water, ten earth—
these are the initial numbers of the Five Phases.
If one obtains their initial state, then knows the metal-wood inheriting the Original,
merging their completion reveals the life-death of water-fire.
Wood follows the child’s return to *shēn* (申), thus beginning to dwell in the womb.
*Qián* (乾) heaven belongs to metal, the east, and its governing function—
thus all six lines are nine, aligning with wood’s shared origin,
lodging in the metal direction, embodying a family’s marvelous function.
When metal comes to invade and occupy the *yín* (寅) position,
with the seven *qi* of *yīn-yūn* (氤氲) heaven,
dwelling in the three yang and receiving conception—
until fire, emerging from *duì* (兑) in the *hài* (亥) position,
obtaining three water, earth, and *guàn* (艮),
arising in the *xùn* (巽) direction—
its omens then appear in *yín-shēn-wèi-hài* (寅申巳亥).
The *Nǚtái* says: "This is the beginning," yet the *qi* does not congeal—
form and substance are fully refined here,
generating without interruption—thus differing from the *Hong Fan*.
Generation has conflict, yet also harmonious principle.
From the *Xian Jing*.

One follows the Original and does not terminate—thus called "beginning," emerging from the without-name.

**Two: The Great Ultimate generates Three.**
With name, the mother of myriad things.
The beginning is the origin—
before its generation is seen.
The generating is the mother—
things generate, then forms appear;
forms appear, then nourishment arises;
nourishment arises, then numbers emerge—this is the nameable.
The Classic begins with the without-name as the origin,
and the nameable as the generating—thus the non-existent becomes existent.
*The Er Ya* says: *Zhào* (肇), *zǔ* (祖), *yuán* (元), *tāi* (胎)—these are "beginning."
The *Kūn* hexagram embodies earth’s Dao, wife’s Dao, subject’s Dao—mother’s Dao.
*Qián* begins it; *kūn* generates it—
thus, pairing husband and wife brings forth male and female;
with male and female, the name of mother first becomes clear.
Thus, first speaking of beginning, then speaking of mother—
fourfold explanations arise:
One through yin-yang, two through heaven-earth,
three through father-mother, four through having-not-having.
Yin-yang is *qi*; *qi* is the division of yin-yang.
Initially, one *qi* unfurls—originally without yin-yang.
When the Great Ultimate generates one *qi*,
the light and clear ascend to form heaven,
the heavy and turbid descend to form earth.
Again, the *Kāi Tiān Jīng* says: "When heaven’s *qi* is sufficient, the surplus becomes earth."
Speaking of sufficiency reveals yin-yang has fixed numbers—
numbers are complete, then divided.
In the *Hun Yuan* era, though yin-yang existed,
refinement was not yet extreme, mixed yet undivided—
thus *Liezi* says: "The *qi* and form are complete yet not separated"—
this is the "mixed and turbid."
Again, the Original Beginning, with the Primordial Three *qi*,
generates thirty-six heavens above and thirty-six earths below—
above and below merge their virtue to form yin-yang.

「Again, the clear is the source of the turbid—this is seen in the *Qīng Jìng Jīng* ["Scripture of Pure Stillness"];
the yin is the nourishment of the yang—this is seen in the *Shēng Shén Zhāng* ["Chapter on the Spirit of Birth"].

From this, it may be observed that yin-yang originates from one *qi* yet divides itself into two,
hence the saying: *"Merge and then divide"*—the beginning of heaven and earth.
Originally, there are no parents;
they are born within the Great Emptiness (*Tàixū*), void and boundless,
conceived within the Primordial Chaos (*Hùndùn*), one *qi* undivided—
their form is like a chicken’s egg: yellow within, white without.
Before their division, heaven and earth are nurtured in the Soul’s Source (*Língyuán*).
When they divide, above and below are distinguished as heaven and earth.

Three *qi* merge to form *virtue* (*dé*), accumulating to nine for the yang.
Once the nine yang *qi* ascend, the surplus becomes earth.
Thus, heaven has nine heavens, earth has nine earths—
the Great Luo (*Dàluó*) forms the thirty-six heavens,
the three palaces of Metal, Fire, and Earth complete the merged numbers.

The Middle Luo (*Zhōngluó*) forms thirty-six heavens,
combining with thirty-two heavens—
the numbers of the Four Beginnings (*Sìshǐ*) arise.

The *Jiùkǔ Jīng* ["Scripture of Saving Suffering"] states:
*"Thirty-six above, thirty-six below—
this is heaven’s birth and earth’s completion,
uniting heaven and earth’s numbers,
totaling seventy-two as the seasonal markers,
fulfilling the beginning and the end."*

Heaven and earth are the manifested symbols (*chéngxiàng*) of the Dao/Way.
The Dao/Way has no abode, yet it abides in heaven and earth.
Heaven and earth have no abode, yet they abide in the *Kàn* ["Receptive"] and *Kūn* ["Comprehensive"].
Thus, heaven is called father, earth is called mother—
heaven and earth merge from one *qi* to give birth to all things,
acting as father and mother.

The *Kàn* aspect pertains to the beginning (*shǐ*),
the *Kūn* aspect pertains to birth (*shēng*),
for the Dao/Way of beginning and birth is one.
Is it not that the form of heaven is male and the form of earth is female?

Those who grasp the meaning forget the symbols,
those who grasp the symbols forget the words—
if one has not yet grasped the meaning and symbols,
how can one exhaust their truth?

Thus, when discussing heaven and earth through one *qi*,
it is akin to the *Kàn* aspect dividing into spirit and matter—
this is the *"merge and then divide."*

From this, it may be observed that the Dao/Way is the mother of heaven and earth,
and heaven and earth are the mothers of all things—
thus it may be understood.

This is the *"divide and then merge"*—
the *Kàn* aspect as heaven and father,
the *Kūn* aspect as earth and mother.
From heaven to earth, eighty-four thousand *lǐ* [leagues],
and from earth to heaven, likewise.

When discussing the trigrams’ symbols (*guàxiàng*),
the *Fù* ["Return"] to *Tài* ["Great"] is three yin and three yang—
the *Kàn* below and *Kūn* above is the time of heaven and earth’s harmonious exchange (*jiāotài*).
The *Yì* ["Changes"] says: *"When male and female merge their essence, all things transform and are born"*—
this is the *Tài* ["Great"].

The *Tài* ["Great"] is the *Zhōnghé* ["Central Harmony"].
Within this, there is a *chōngqì* ["colliding/central *qi*"].
Dark and obscure, vague and indistinct—
here, the utmost truth (*Zhìzhēn*) converges,
this being the intent of all things containing life.

Yet, when heaven and earth are measured by eighty-four thousand *lǐ*,
the half-yin within yang is the spring equinox (*Chūnfēn*),
the half-yang within yin is the autumn equinox (*Qiūfēn*—
this too is the symbol of male and female union.

Though heaven is distant from earth and earth from heaven,
without the *qi*’s exchange and harmony (*jiāohé*),
how could they be called parents?
How could there be the principle of life and birth?

Thus, before division, it is called Primordial Chaos (*Hùndùn*),
after division, it is distinguished as yin-yang,
differing essences merge as male and female,
and marriage unites them as husband and wife.
The *Yì* ["Changes"] says: *"Only after male and female does husband and wife exist."*

Thus, the mother is taken to speak of birth.
The *virtue* (*dé*) that exists yet is empty—
this is the reverse of things;
the *power* (*shén*) that exists yet is none—
this is the origin of truth.

The nameless is the origin of true emptiness (*Zhēnkōng*),
the named is the wondrous application of things (*Miàoyǒng*).
Yet if the truth is without form (*wú*),
why wait for form to display its wonder?

One *qi* divides itself, the Three Powers (*Sāncái*) distinguish themselves,
all things take root naturally—
who directs this? Who sustains this?
This is called *Zìrán* ["Self-So/Naturalness"].

If discussing the *Shǐ* ["Making"] that causes this,
the *virtue* (*dé*) that has its own source is so,
the *power* (*shén*) that lacks its own source is not—
how could one escape heaven’s unfolding and earth’s completion,
yin’s merging and yang’s interfacing?

Without the mother, how could birth be displayed?
Without birth, how could one be called mother?
The *Scripture* says: *"The Dao/Way gives birth to it"*—
thus the Dao/Way is the mother of all things.

Entering without exit, existing without form—
as if there were a mechanism yet unable to act on its own.
The duality of having and not having,
if not the Dao/Way, then who?

Establishing the name "mother," the void emerges as reality (*shí*),
establishing the beginning (*shǐ*), reality returns to the void.
One having, one not having—
the Dao/Way’s wondrous application.
The origin of the none—
one must recognize the Great Emptiness (*Tàixū*),
the function of returning—
its essence lies within the mother.

The numbers of heaven and earth,
five *Kàn* and ten *Lí* ["Fire"]—
five times five is the mother,
scattering to give birth to all things—
this is called *Miàoyǒu* ["Wondrous Possession"].

As in the case of six *Wù* ["Not Yet"] added to *Kàn*,
six *Jǐ* ["Already"] added to *Lí* ["Fire"]—
the principle of life and birth is thus revealed.

Three distinctions (*Sānbàn*) manifest two bodies (*tǐ*).
First: **Stillness and Reflection (*Jìngzhào*) as the constant form (*Chángtǐ*)**.
Constantly without desire to observe its wonder—
the Dao/Way that may be spoken of is not the constant Dao/Way,
the name that may be named is not the constant name—
pointing to the constant Dao/Way and constant name is to exhaust the wonder.

It cannot be seen, cannot be heard—
it causes people to abandon sight and sound beyond names and words,
this being not attainable by those with intent.
Only those without intent may comprehend it—
thus it is called the *constant Dao/Way*.

Next: **The nameless beginning of heaven and earth, the named mother of all things—**
speaking of the Dao/Way’s wondrous application.
The first four sentences speak of wonder (*miào*),
the last two reveal its application (*yòng*).

To speak of wonder yet not of application,
the Dao/Way has no display.
To speak of application yet not of wonder,
affairs may obstruct the principle.

Moreover, all things receive their mandate from the none (*wú*),
yet take form in the having (*yǒu*).
The principle is thus again confirmed,
and the sages perceive it—
this lies in the seen and the seeing.

The Dao/Way has no color or form (*sèxiàng*),
the truth transcends names and words (*Míngyán*).
Delving deeply, one’s essence is perfected beyond the heart (*wúxīn*),
one’s destination is exhausted in reality (*shíqù*).
Since the void and none (*Xūwú*) is the Dao/Way,
why cling to things’ forms and appearances (*xiàngyīn*)?
To not abandon perception and hearing,
how could one return to purity and stillness?

Purity and stillness (*Qīngjìng*) are the root of nature (*xìng*),
color and form (*sèxiàng*) are the cause of names (*míng*).
Nature’s root is serene and pure (*zhànrán*),
neither name nor form.
Separating from nature while forms arise—
this is delusion, this is emptiness (*wàngwú*).
Thus names arise from the body and form,
forms arise from the mind’s perception (*niànxīn*),
truth and falsehood stand opposed—
the Dao/Way’s origin is difficult to trace.»

The **Dao/Way** (*Zhuāngzǐ*) speaks of the **Mystery of Mysteries** (*Xuánxuán*): since all things arise from the void and none (*Xūwú*), yet take form in the manifest (*yǒuxiàng*), the **Mystery** (*Lǐ*) is thus established, and the **Sage** (*Shèngrén*) perceives it, abiding in perception and awareness (*cúnxū jiànjiàn*). The **Dao/Way** is without color and form (*wú sèxiàng*), true beyond names and words (*zhēn jué míngyán*), its essence exhausted in the heartless (*wúxīn*), its destination fulfilled in the real (*shíqù*). Since the void and none is the **Dao/Way**, why cling to things’ forms and appearances (*xiàngyīn*)? To not abandon perception and hearing (*bù jué jiànwén*), how could one return to purity and stillness (*Qīngjìng*)?

Purity and stillness (*Qīngjìng*) are the root of nature (*xìng*), color and form (*sèxiàng*) the cause of names (*míng*). Nature’s root is serene and pure (*zhànrán*), neither name nor form. When form arises without nature—this is delusion, this is emptiness (*wàngwú*). Thus names arise from the body and form, forms from the mind’s perception (*niànxīn*), truth and falsehood stand opposed—yet the **Dao/Way**’s origin remains unfathomable (*nán yuán*).

---

**Thus**, the one who composes the **Scriptures** (*Jīng*) must uphold the void and none (*Xūwú*), while the seeker of **Mystery** (*Lǐ*) must observe color and form (*sèxiàng*). Through the void, one perceives reality (*jiàn shí*), from delusion and illusion (*huànwàng*), one knows the return (*zhī guī*). From none (*wú*) comes the having (*yǒu*), refined thought coalescing with dust to achieve completion (*jīng xiǎng chén ér chéngjiù*). Things lack inherent nature (*wú zìxìng*), hence the saying of the void (*yú wú yǒu yán*). The **Dao/Way** is nameless (*wú míng*), for it is not color. This is **Zhuāngzi**’s teaching: **"Before the having (*yǒu*), there was the none (*wú*), and before the none, there was the none"** (*Wèi shǐ yǒu fū, wèi shǐ yǒu wú yě zhě*).

**Second**, the **Way**’s constant and transformative application (*Cháng*). The **Sage** seeks its subtle essence (*miào*) through desireless observation (*wúyù guān qù*). The **Dao/Way** itself does not generate, nor is its none (*wú*) not the **Dao/Way**. The **Dao/Way** descends into things (*wù*), yet things are never not true (*wù wú fēi zhēn*). When things return to the **Dao/Way**, the **Dao/Way** does not claim dominion over them. The **Dao/Way**’s true constancy (*Zhēncháng*) is effortlessly free (*tuōrán wú lèi*), yet how can one speak of the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) as a mere sweeping vision (*fànjǐng*), a single *qi* spontaneously arising (*yī qì zì shēng*)?

The **Mystery** (*Xuán*) coalesces with true essence (*Zhēn*), and the **Three Powers** (*Sāncái*—Heaven, Earth, and Man) manifest their concrete forms and symbols (*xìngxiàng*) in Heaven. Then the **Six Qi** (*Liùqì*—Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, and Void) circulate and gather to form shapes (*huí bóbó chéngxíng*) upon Earth. The **Five Phases** (*Wǔxíng*—Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water) generate and transform, while **Yin** and **Yang** govern their grand cycles (*Yīnyáng zǒng qí dàshù*). The **Eight Trigrams** (*Bāguà*) are fixed by the **Four Seasons** (*Sìshí*), with standards both constant (*yǒucháng*) and ever-changing (*biànhuà bùyǐ*), in life and death (*yī shēng yī miè*), as the **Mystery** (*Lǐ*) of things inherently is (*zài wù lǐ zhī gùrán*).

The **Dao/Way**’s **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is undying and unborn (*bùsǐ bùshēng*), its governance refined through **Yin** and **Yang** (*yīnyáng zhī zhèngmiào*). Those who grasp this **Dao/Way** belong to the **Perfect Ones** (*Zhìrén*). To fail in understanding the origin of life (*wèi dá shēngyuán*), yet to cling to illusion and extinction (*tú guī huànmiè*), is to not exhaust the **Mystery** (*Bù qióng zàohuà*)—this is the **Way**’s direct pointing to **Rest** (*Xiū*) and **Floating** (*Fú*), unaware of the **Mystery** (*Shù*) in death. When things lose their **Spirit** (*Shén*), their forms are not burdened by the **Mystery** (*Shù*). Those who exhaust the **Mystery** (*Shù*) recognize that **Void** (*Kōng*) is not truly void, nor **Form** (*Sè*) truly form. This is the work of the **Inverted Observer** (*Nì guān zhě*).

**Void** (*Xuán*) is the **Mystery** (*Xuán*). Earlier, it was said that having and none arise from the same **Mystery** (*Tǐ*), so one cannot distinguish them as having and none (*bù dé yǐ yǒu wú ér shū guān*). Later, the teaching is strictly sealed, hence the saying: **"Void is the **Mystery**"** (*Tóng wèi zhī xuán*). The character *tóng* (同) is composed of *yī* (一, "one") and *kǒu* (口, "mouth"), yet both are one in right and wrong (*yī zhě shìfēi, yī zhě shìfēi*). Thus, if they do not share the same *kǒu*, then right and wrong are the same. Hence, the **Great Unity** (*Dàtóng*) transcends humanity (*lí rén*).

To transcend humanity is to enter Heaven (*rù tiān*), and to enter Heaven is to align with the **Dao/Way** (*tóng dào*), which is called the **Mystery** (*Xuán*). This is the **Great Unity** (*Dàtóng*). The **Mystery** (*Xuán*) of having and none (*Yǒu wú èr lǐ*) is the same, yet the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is spoken of as void (*wú*), making it subtle yet unseen (*miào ér bù kě jiàn*). Thus, the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is also seen through having (*yǒu*), how could it be said that the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is not the same? All things arise from having within none (*wú zhōng chū yǒu*), and none is contained within having (*yǒu zhōng hán wú*), rooted in the same nature (*bēn yī xìng*). Why then distinguish them as different?

「Yet the nature of the **Great Unity** (*Dàtóng*) is first revealed through the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) of transcending form and emptiness (*bèi sèkōng*), and further through the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) of surpassing having and none (*lí yǒuwú*). Thus, its meaning becomes gradually clear.

To awaken is to perceive the **Dao/Way** in every aspect (*tóutóu shì dào*), while to be deluded is to see distinctions in all phenomena (*mí shì jiànjiàn jiē shū*). To regard death and life as one thread (*yī tiáo*), and to treat the acceptable and unacceptable as a single passage (*yī guàn*), only then can one attain **equality and wisdom** (*píngděng xìngzhì*) to enter it.

**Yuè Jiě** says: *"Subtle yet minute is called the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)."*
The **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is the essence of Heaven (*tiān zhī sè*).
The *Book of Meaning* (*Shūyì*) states: *"Subtle yet minute is called the **Mystery** (*Xuán*), vast yet responsive is called **exalted** (*jùn*)."*
When **virtue/power** (*dé*) is concealed, it is subtle yet minute—this is the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).
When **virtue/power** (*dé*) is manifested, it becomes vast yet responsive—this is **exalted** (*jùn*).
Thus, among the **Sages** (*shèngrén*), when **virtue/power** (*dé*) is in the lower realm, it is called the **Mystery** (*Xuán*), and when in the higher realm, it is called **exalted** (*jùn*).
*"Subtle yet minute"* is indeed the **Mystery** (*Xuán*), yet it is difficult to speak of.

The **Dao/Way** has no form or appearance (*wú xíngxiàng*), so who can distinguish its vastness and minuteness?
The **Dao/Way** is vast as Heaven is vast (*dào dà tiān dà*), how could it be said to be minute?
In its relation to things (*qí zài wù*), how can minuteness be divided?
It is called *"hidden"* (*yǐn*) because it lacks form (*wú xíng*).
It is called *"profound"* (*ào*) because it is unfathomable (*wú cè*).
Indeed, the **Sage’s** heart (*shèngrén zhī xīn*), in harmony with the **Dao/Way**, is subtle.
When it emerges to respond to things (*chū ér yìng wù*), in principle it is hidden (*zài lǐ yǐn*), in practice it is manifest (*zài shì xiǎn*).
Though the practice is minute, it reveals itself as vast—this is the **Dao/Way** entering the ears and eyes of mortals (*zhù rén zhī ěrmù*).
The **Dao/Way** is vast yet dwells in minuteness—this is the profound depths of the heart’s abode (*chǔ xīn zhī yuānměi*).
Minuteness is the right (*yòu*), the right is the **yin** (*yīn*).
Through its hidden nature, the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is subtle yet does not conceal its application (*ér bù cáng yòng*).
Vastness is the left (*zuǒ*), the left is the **prince** (*jūn*).
Through its manifest nature, it reveals the practice yet does not display the principle (*ér bù xiǎn lǐ*).
Thus it is said: *"Subtle yet minute is called the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)."*

Five praises of the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).
First, all **dharma** (*zhūfǎ*) possess subtle essence.
The **Mystery** (*Xuán*) scripture observes its subtlety through constant non-desire (*wú yù*), and its profundity through constant desire (*yǒu yù*).
Again, the same origin yet different names is called the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).
This binds the meaning of the first two sentences, unifying having and none into one principle (*yī zhèng*).
It is also said: *"The **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)."*
Initially, it refers to direct perception of the **Dao/Way**’s illumination (*jiànjué xiàngzhào*), awakening to this having and none (*wù yǒuwú*), where the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) is unified in essence (*yīn shì yǒuwú*), and thus deep insight is attained (*shēn shí zhī*).
Yet the meaning of *"the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)"* transcends the former principle (*yòu fēi qián lǐ kě bì*).
The scripture’s intent proceeds step by step (*cìdì shì yǒuwú*).
Having and none arise from the **Dao/Way** (*yǒuwú shēng yú dào*), and the **Dao/Way** governs having and none (*dào suǒyǐ sī yǒuwú*).
Yet having is inherently having (*yǒu zì yǒu*), not the **Dao/Way**’s having (*fēi dào zhī yǒu*).
None is inherently none (*wú zì wú*), not the **Dao/Way**’s none (*fēi dào zhī wú*).
This is the **Dao/Way**’s sovereign yet non-sovereign nature (*zhī dào zhǔ zhī ér bù zhǔ*).
Yet none also emerges from the **Dao/Way** (*rán wú yì chū yú dào*), and having also emerges from the **Dao/Way** (*yǒu yì chū yú dào*).
Since none’s essence is the **Mystery** (*Xuán*), having’s essence cannot but also be the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).
None manifests as images and patterns (*xiàngshù*), and images and patterns return to annihilation and none (*xiàngshù rù wú*).
The *Listed Master* (*Lièzǐ*) says: *"Self-generated, self-transformed"* is this.
Thus, having and none are not entangled with the **Dao/Way** (*yǒuwú bù gān yú dào*), and it is clear.
Yet having and none both emerge from the **Dao/Way** (*yǒuwú jiē zì dào chū*), and thus each attains the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).
It is like one father with two sons—father and sons share the same surname (*xìng*).
How could the father’s surname be given to the elder son yet not to the younger?
This illustrates the **Dao/Way**’s **Mystery** (*Xuán*), and having and none cannot but share the same **Mystery** (*Xuán*).

When applied in humanity (*qí yòng zài rén*), the **Dao/Way** generates from **Oneness** (*yī*).
**Oneness** is number (*shù*), the beginning (*shǐ*), and the meaning of *"embracing the beginning as one"* (*bàoshǐ yī*) returns to the **Great None** (*Tàiwú*).
Then, the body’s use and practice (*shēnzhōng yòngshì*) are revealed.
How could it be merely carried by empty words (*qǐ zhí yǐ xūyán zàizhī*)?
When the **Dragon** (*lóng*) and **Tiger** (*hǔ*) intermingle, the **Sage’s embryo** (*shèngtāi*) is formed.
The **Sage’s embryo** is refined and reveals the **True Person** (*zhēnrén*).
The **True Person** emerges and rides upon the **Divine Light** (*shén guāng*).
**Zhuangzi** says: *"Ascending upon the **Divine Light** (*shén guāng*) with form’s annihilation."*

Second, the subtlety precedes all **dharma** (*zhūfǎ*).
Again, the **Mystery** (*Xuán*): all **dharma** arise from the **Dao/Way** (*cóng dào ér shēng*).
The coarse and refined—each possesses the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)’s principle (*yīyī jiē yǒu Xuánlǐ*), called *"the essence of the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)"* (*tǐ Xuán*).
The **Mystery** (*Xuán*) of essence has not yet escaped traces (*wú tuō yú jì*).
To transcend the essence’s **Mystery** (*Xuán*), to depart from the essence’s application (*zhuàngxíng ér shàng*), and to ascend beyond form (*chéng shén guāng*), this is *"the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)"* (*shì yòu Xuán*).
The *Sutra of Strict Adherence* (*Léngyán*) says: *"Subtle yet constant is tranquil, having and none are both none, none and none are also annihilated."*
This speaks of **nature** (*xìng*).
Earlier, it was said that the scripture proceeds step by step (*cìdì*).
*"Step by step"* refers to distinguishing **sudden** (*dùn*) and **gradual** (*jiàn*), and **sudden** (*dùn*) and **gradual** (*jiàn*) refer to dividing **Great Vehicle** (*dàchéng*) and **Small Vehicle** (*xiǎochéng*).
The **Great Vehicle** (*dàchéng*) and **Small Vehicle** (*xiǎochéng*) are arranged in stages of fruition (*jiēguǒ*).
As in the *Ocean of the Void and Wisdom Storehouse* (*Hǎikōng Zhìcáng*) discourse on having and none (*yǒuwú zhī yì*), the **ultimate subtlety** (*miàoyǒu*) and **ultimate none** (*miàowú*) are the consummation (*jiūjìng*).
As in the **Nature School** (*Xìngzōng*) discourse on **inner void** (*nèikōng*), **outer void** (*wàikōng*), **inner-outer void** (*nèiwài kōng*), **void of void** (*kōngkōng*), **great void** (*dàkōng*), **ultimate void** (*shèngyì kōng*), **void of conditioned dharma** (*yǒuwú kōng*), **void of unconditioned dharma** (*wúwéi kōng*), **ultimate void** (*jìngyì kōng*), **void without bounds** (*wújì kōng*), **scattered void** (*sǎnkōng*), **void without change** (*wúbiàn yì kōng*), **void of inherent nature** (*běnxìng kōng*), **void of self-nature** (*zìxiàng kōng*), **void of shared nature** (*gòngxìng kōng*), **void of all dharma** (*yīqiè fǎ kōng*), **void of attainability** (*bùkědé kōng*), **void of inherent nature and self-nature** (*wúxìng zìxìng kōng*), the principle has not yet reached its limit (*lǐ yóu wèi jí*).
Only *"void of attainability"* (*bùkědé kōng*) is the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*).

The term *"the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)"* sighs at the **Dao/Way**’s profound and distant nature (*dào zhī shēnyuǎn*).
No extremes are established (*èrbiān bù lì*), nor is the middle **Dao/Way** (*zhōngdào*) secured.
Speech and silence are inexhaustible (*yánmò fěi qióng*), yet it is called *"the actual"** (*shìshí*).
Thus, one does not tread upon emptiness (*bù shǐ bù jiè xū*), and this is the true **Oneness** (*zhēnyī*).
This is the attainment of having (*suǒwéi yǒudé*), the so-called *"profound subtlety"* (*wēimiào*).

Now, we divide the gates of **sudden** (*dùn*) and **gradual** (*jiàn*), the stages of the three **Vehicles** (*sānchéng*), to verify the meaning of *"the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)"*.

Before the **Mixed Primordial** (*Hùnyuán*), there was no name nor image (*wú míng wú xiàng*).
Once the **Mixed Primordial** (*Hùnyuán*) is distinguished (*bìpàn*), there are images and names (*yǒu xiàng yǔ míng*).
From the time before namelessness (*zì wú míng yǐqián*), direct insight into its principle (*zhí wù qí lǐ*) is called **sudden** (*dùn*).
If from the time after having names (*cóng yǒu míng zhī hòu*), to subdue having and return to none (*shè yǒu guī wú*), this is called **gradual** (*jiàn*).
**Sudden** (*dùn*) does not establish a single **dharma** (*bù lì yī fǎ*), while **gradual** (*jiàn*) begins with cultivation and practice (*shǐ yú xiūwéi*).
The gate of cultivation and practice (*xiūwéi zhī mén*) is inherently attained through teaching (*zì yánjiào dé*).
This is the so-called *"daily progress"* (*rìyì*).
Progress yet capable of decline (*yì ér néng sǔn*), until *"again decline"* (*yòu sǔn*), one attains *"the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)"* (*zhèng yòu Xuán*).
In **nature** (*xìng*) it is so, and in **command** (*mìng*) it is also so.
The **Canon of Vitality and Health** (*Wèishēng zhī jīng*) begins with nurturing life (*yǎngshēng*), proceeds to prolonged life (*chángshēng*), and culminates in ascension to immortality (*fēixiān*).
The principle of **sudden** (*dùn*) and **gradual** (*jiàn*) each has its own tendency (*yǒu yóu qù*).
The meaning of *"the **Mystery** (*Xuán*) within the **Mystery** (*Xuán*)"* is not the ultimate scope of the **middle** (*zhōng*) and **small** (*xiǎo*) **Vehicles** (*chéng*).

The **Supreme Lord of the Dao** (*Tàishàng Dàojūn*) says:
*"Neither void nor non-void, nor void of void,
Neither **dharma** nor non-**dharma**, nor neither **dharma** nor non-**dharma**,
Neither thing nor non-thing, nor neither thing nor non-thing,
Neither person nor non-person, nor neither person nor non-person,
Neither cause nor non-cause, nor neither cause nor non-cause,
Neither fruit nor non-fruit, nor neither fruit nor non-fruit,
Neither beginning nor non-beginning, nor neither beginning nor non-beginning,
Neither end nor non-end, nor neither end nor non-end,
Neither end nor non-end, nor neither end nor non-end,
Yet as the root and foundation of all **dharma** (*yīqiè zhūfǎ gēnběn*).
Without contrivance nor action (*wú zào wú zuò*), it is called **natural** (*zìrán*)."*

The **Dao/Way** unfolds naturally, yet cannot be compelled to act nor prevented from acting.
Again it is said: The **Dao/Way** referred to as *playen* (玄), when rooted in the boundless four directions, exhausts the meaning of *playen*.

From this, the practitioner, neither clinging to void nor to existence, is called *playen*.
Yet this *playen* transcends all attainment, thus it is named **Double-Playen** (*Chóng Playen*), the gateway to all marvels.
Now we establish the **Sudden Teaching** (*Dùn Jiào*), naming it **Yet-Playen** (*Yòu Playen*), its meaning radiant.

Again, speaking of the **Great Vehicle** (*Dà Playen*) and the **Supreme Vehicle** (*Wúshàng Playen*), the **Teaching of Jade Purity** (*Yùqīng Jiào*) is the **Great Vehicle**, while the **Supreme Vehicle** is the **extinction of traces** (*Mǐn jì*) in the Three Purity Ones (*Sānqīng*).
Even as the **Supreme Lord of the Dao** (*Tàishàng Dàojūn*) in the **Nine Grades of Great Purity** (*Tàiqīng Jiǔpǐn*), one enters the realm of *playen*.
The **Nine Grades of Great Truth** (*Shàngzhēn Jiǔpǐn*), one attains the utmost *playen*.
The **Nine Grades of Great Sagehood** (*Shàngshèng Jiǔpǐn*), one reaches **Yet-Playen**.
When the Three Purity Ones are all extinguished, there is boundless **Yet-Playen** (*Wúliàng yòu Playen*).

All this is revealed through **nature** (*xìng*) and illuminated by the **Dao/Way** (*dào*), the grand essence of the scriptures resides here.
Thus, it is called the **Round Teaching** (*Yuán Jiào*), encompassing **nature** and **life** (*xìngmìng*).

When **virtue/power** (*dé*) enters, it becomes the **Dao/Way** (*dào*); when **nature** (*xìng*) merges, it becomes **life** (*mìng*).
This **life** (*mìng*), the culmination of **nature** (*xìng*), differs from the **life** of longevity (*chángshēng*).

The **life** of nurturing vitality (*yǎngshēng*) is not merely the fulfillment of **nature** (*xìng*), but also requires the preservation of deep roots and firm foundations.

Again, following the **Longevity School** (*Chángshēng zōng*), the **Yet-Playen** of the **Double-Playen** (*Chóng Playen*) is divided into two gates.
*Playen* is the inherent principle of all ten thousand things, manifesting in form and perception, revealing marvels in action, and transcending marvels to commune with the divine—all these are called *playen*.
*Playen* is ever concealed.
With concealment as **mystery** (*mì*), and **mystery** not transmitted, thus the **Forbidden Texts of the Flower Hall** (*Huā Táng nèijìn zhī shū*) are sealed, and their penetration lies in **entry** (*rù*).

Those who can penetrate are called **Seeing the Mechanism** (*jiàn jī*).
The *Yì* says: *"Delve into the profound and explore the hidden, hook the depths and reach the distant."* (*tàn zé shì suǒ yǐn, gōu shēn zhì yuǎn*)

Yet the hidden *playen* of things cannot compare to the hidden *playen* of the human body.
The hidden *playen* of the human body is the **Heavenly Mechanism** (*Tiānjī*).

**Laozi** says: *"The human body is subtle and marvelous, the worldly cannot speak of it."* (*rén shēn wēimiào, fán shì nán yán*)
Meaning all people value the distant and despise the near, unaware of the *playen* within their own bodies, yet only seeking to exhaust the mysteries of external things.

The *playen* within the body—sages discern the subtleties of yin and yang, and thus establish the **Law-Image of Heaven and Earth** (*fǎ xiàng guànkūn*), forming the **Nine Elixir Secrets** (*Jiǔdān zhī jué*), the **Longevity Doctrine** (*Chángshēng zhī zōng*).
They say the **Dao/Way**’s essence lies in the profound and subtle, the **Heavenly Mechanism** is deep and distant, and only the most profound cannot speak of it.

This method originates from the **Three Sovereigns** (*Sān Huáng*), and is transmitted to **Yellow Emperor** (*Huángdì*).
Later, those who succeeded the sages were many, yet their recorded teachings are sparse.
Only **Wei Boyang** (*Wèi Bóyáng*) composed the *Parameters of the Triple Concord* (*Shēntóng Qì*), correctly taking the **hexagrams and trigrams** (*yáo xiàng*) and **systematic words** (*xì yán*) of the *Zhou Yì* (周易), harmonizing them with the **Six Celestial Children** (*Liù Tiānzǐ*), moving the **Heavenly Mechanism** of Earth and Heaven, and unfolding its profound mysteries.
His words say: *"To refine the **Golden Elixir** (*Jīnyè*) and **Great Elixir** (*Tàidān*), one must first seek the **mixed origins** (*hùnyuán*) of Heaven and Earth, investigate the **foundations of yin and yang transformation** (*yīnyáng zàohuà zhī běn*), understand that **water and fire** (*shuǐhuǒ*) **subdue and restore** (*kèfù*) each other as husband and wife, and recognize that **metal and water** (*jīnshuǐ*) **emerge and nourish** (*xiàngshēng*) each other as child and mother.
Thus, when the male contains the female form, **lead** (*qiān*) within produces **sand** (*shā*).
When the female merges with the male form, **sand** (*shā*) within produces **mercury** (*gǒng*)."*

The Sun is **yang**. Within the Sun lies the **crow**—**yin** containing **yang**. The Moon is **yin**. Within the Moon lies the **rabbit**—**yang** containing **yin**. Thus, there exists the **Dao/Way** of **yin** and **yang** reversing, the principle of **water** and **fire** requiring each other. The **Dao/Way** of **creation and transformation** is now clear.

Having known their positions, one must also know their **roots**—these are the **mixed origins** (*hùnyuán*) of Heaven and Earth. Having taken their **roots**, one must also take their **symbols**—these are the **paired symbols** of **yin** and **yang**. Having obtained their **symbols**, one must inquire into **movement and stillness**; when **movement and stillness** are clear, one must know their **numbers**; having known their **numbers**, one must follow the **water clock**; when the **water clock** is divided, one must clarify **advance and retreat**; when **advance and retreat** are clear, one must then **separate the Dragon and Tiger**.

Then the boundaries of **south and north** are divided, and the forms of **metal and water** are united. Thus, the **Great Elixir** (*Dàdān*) may be refined.

There are also **internal and external methods and symbols**: **water** and **fire** have **dryness and moisture**; there are **cauldrons and chambers**; there are **fetal sacs**; there are **advance and retreat**; there are **hexagram symbols**; there are **omens of water and fire**; there are **rules for extraction and addition**; there are **patterns of the trigrams**; there are **forms of separation and union**. As mentioned above, each contains hidden profundity and mystery.

One must exhaust one’s wisdom and still seek instruction from a teacher. If one claims that the **mysterious pass** is a secret and leaves it unsaid, then where is the **doctrine of longevity**?

Previously, it was said: *"The **nameless** is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; the **named** is the mother of ten thousand things."* Speaking of **beginning** and **mother**, yet not speaking of **end**, one must infer the intent—this is called **grasping it**.

As for the **completion of the method** and the **principle of threefold perfection**, the **golden edicts and jade inscriptions** are recorded, the **Dao/Way** is transmitted, and the **doctrine of the Five Immortals** is elucidated. The **essentials of nine returns and seven transformations** are distinguished—this is the gathering of the **most profound mysteries**.

As for those of **minor attainment**, they are **initial profundity**; those of **medium attainment** are **ultimate profundity**; those of **great attainment** are **profoundest profundity**. This is seen in **cultivating the body and nurturing life**, **ingesting qi** and **refining the elixir**, ultimately achieving **transcendence and ascension**, ascending to the **ultimate profundity**—all of this has stages.

Like their **nature**, from **empty delusion** to **true emptiness**; like their **life**, from **cultivated vitality** to **ascending to the True**—profound beyond profundity, its meaning is thus.

To **be able to be without** is not yet to **be able to be without without**; thus, one cannot yet be the **gate of all mysteries**. To **be able to nurture qi** is not yet to **be able to refine the spirit**; thus, one cannot yet grasp the **logic of profoundest profundity**. **Nature exists in emptiness**, **life exists in reality**—only then does the **gate of mysteries** appear, not inherently mysterious, but **mysterious in multitude**.

The **Six Canons** symbolize **virtue**. The **gate of all mysteries**—as the *Explanation of Characters* says—**three persons** constitute a **multitude**; this is not limited to three. From **Heaven and Earth** to **all things**, from **sentient beings** to **insentient things**, all are encompassed by it. Thus, it is called the **gate of all mysteries**.

Truly reaching **profundity** is **exhausting one’s nature**; exhausting one’s nature is **oneness alone**. **Profoundest profundity** is **ultimate life**. Ultimate life enters **neither death nor birth**; thus, the **Dao/Way** has **no gate, no side paths**—it is the **vast and boundless sovereign**.

If one speaks of it as a **gate**, then the **Dao/Way** indeed has a **location**—this is incorrect. Speaking of it as a **gate** means it is not in any **location**; speaking of it as the **Dao/Way**, **nature has a returning movement**. Because of this returning movement, it is spoken of in terms of **entering and exiting**; yet speaking of **entering and exiting**, one has not yet seen **perfected nature**. When **nature is perfected**, there is nothing to perfect. Who exits? Who enters? Only then can one **gather all things** in the **ultimate void**, making the **mysterious oneness** an **unfathomable spirit**.

The *Classic of Change* says: *"Perfected nature, abiding, abiding—this is the gate of Dao/Way and virtue."* Thus, **birth and death**, as the *Secret of the Dark* says, **"Heaven gives life, Heaven takes life"**—this is the **principle of the Dao/Way**. **Exiting mechanisms, entering mechanisms**—as the **Gèn** trigram says, **"When the time to stop arrives, stop; when the time to move arrives, move."**

Those who **exit without fear** have **embodied the Dao/Way**; those who **enter without delight** have **penetrated profundity**; and those who **exit and enter without knowing why they exit and enter** have **exhausted the mysteries**. Thus, knowing the **gate** means **penetrating the principles of life and death for all things**, revealing the **doctrine of the return of all things**, and indeed, all things **receive their mandate from the **nameless**—this is **emerging from the **nameless** to the **named****.

Those who receive their mandate from the **Dao/Way** are all **mysterious**; thus, it is called **all mysteries**. How mysterious is it? Like **water**—those who **transgress** are **drowned**; all who are **born from the Dao/Way** possess **mystery**.

Next, it is said: *"I emerge from the **gate of all mysteries** and obtain **oneness**; **oneness** is within me. I shall carry this mystery and return, restoring my **root** and **command**, embodying **profoundest profundity**, and also being able to **master all mysteries**."* Like **fire**—**illuminating from myself**, all things are illuminated; **transforming from myself**, all things are transformed. Initially, the **Dao/Way’s mystery** is **me**; ultimately, **I** am also the **mystery of all things**. When one reaches this point, does the **Dao/Way** truly **mystify me**, or do **I** truly **mystify all things**? Ultimately, it advances to **unknowing**.

Shào Ruòyú says: *"The **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of is the **gate of all mysteries**."* The **Great Dao/Way** is **utter void and utter stillness**, **formless and nameless**; it cannot be sought through **sight or hearing**, cannot be known through **thought or reasoning**, cannot be attained through **speech or language**. This is the **Dao/Way** of **no beginning and no end**, **constantly existing and unchanging**. From **primordial void**, it **transforms into one qi**; because there is a **trace of one qi**, it is thus **speakable**.

Since it is said to be **speakable**, it is not the **constantly existing Dao/Way**; since there is a **name of qi**, it is not the **constantly existing name**. Before **one qi** manifested, in the **formless and nameless** time, this was the **beginning of Heaven and Earth**. This is the **Dao/Way** that cannot be spoken of. When there is the **name of one qi**, it is the **mother of ten thousand things**—this is the **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of.

Thus, one knows that **my body** emerges from **oneness**, and **human ability** can take **oneness** as **law**. Upon **awakening and entering**, one sees the **Great Dao/Way**. The **Great Dao/Way** is **human true heart**; **one qi** is the **desire born from the heart**.

The true heart is originally empty and tranquil, without birth or annihilation. When the true heart moves, it becomes manifest, and its names are desire-thought, wisdom, intuition, and cognition. Because the heart gives rise to desire, one follows desire and receives birth. After birth, one accepts and rejects pleasures and evils, clings endlessly to the five colors and five sounds, relies on strength and arrogance to dwell in honor or humiliation, and is deluded by false thoughts. Clinging to this false heart, one covers the true heart, failing to comprehend the Dao/Way of **one qi**.

If one abandons falsehood and desire, then one attains **oneness**. This heart, when held, is upright; when obtained, it is luminous. As the mother of ten thousand things, it is also the root of birth and death. Desire covers the true heart, hence there is birth and death.

If one can be without desire, then being without desire is empty and tranquil, returning to the formless beginning. Thus, one can transcend birth and death.

Hence, Laozi says: *"Constantly without desire, one observes the beginning of Heaven and Earth."* This is the subtle mystery of transcending birth and death. Again, he says: *"Constantly with desire, one observes the Dao/Way of one qi."* This is the perilous edge.

Shallow understanding cannot seek the heart with the heart—this is having desire. It cannot annihilate the heart with the heart—this is being without desire. These two—having and not having—are both encompassed as one principle. When spoken of as teaching, they are distinguished by the names "having" and "not having."

When having and not having merge, it is called **Xuan** (the Mysterious). The Buddhist School calls it the **"Non-dual Dharma Gate"** or the **"Middle Way."** The gate of **Xuan** takes the Middle as its law, like a net analogy. Yet since the law arises from the heart, and once it arises in the heart, it clings to the Middle—this is not empty and tranquil.

Laozi feared the Middle Way’s law would bind, preventing one from abandoning the net. Thus, he further explained with **Xuan**, teaching that the student should neither cling to having or not having nor dwell in the Middle Way of **Xuan**. In actual practice, the ground of reality is untouched by even a speck of dust, and the heart becomes empty and tranquil—this is **wuwei** (non-action), so no need for contemplation.

Because there is no attainment, this is being without desire. Hence, no dust arises, and it is called **clearing and tranquility**; there is no action, so it is called **wuwei**; there is no cultivation or realization, so it is called **natural**; there is nothing at all, so it is called **empty and tranquil**; it is unrestrained and free, so it is called **soaring**; it is uniformly ordinary, so it is called **serene and simple**.

Thus, when the heart is without desire, it departs from all distinctions. Departing from distinctions, there is no affliction. When the heart is without desire, encountering things there is no self. Without self, there is no conflict, hence no blame.

When the heart is without desire, it departs from all good and evil. Departing from good and evil, it is not bound by cause and effect. When the heart is without desire, it does not cling to all things, hence there is no birth, and without birth, there is no death.

The heart that is constantly without desire is the gate of all mysteries. King Zhi-ran says: *"The Dao that can be spoken of reaches the gate of all mysteries."* The Dao that cannot be spoken of—when spoken of, it is not so. The Dao that cannot be named—when named, it is not so. Calling it the Dao, can it not be spoken of? The Dao that can be spoken of is not the naturally constant Dao. The name that can be named is not the naturally arising name.

The constantly constant Dao and constantly constant name, like a ring without end, like the four seasons in their course—never beginning, never ending, yet arising and vanishing in turn, decaying and reviving, are not what I call the truly constant.

Constantly without desire, one observes its mystery—this is the substance of the Dao. Constantly with desire, one observes its perilous edge—this is the function of the Dao. Yet substance and function are always concealed in **huanghu** (obscurity and confusion). Between the subtle and coarse, the profound and the obscure, it cannot be known by wisdom, cannot be perceived by cognition, nor can it be attained through sight, hearing, or response.

How then does one attain it? There are those who learn and know it; there are none who know it without learning.

The *Yijing* says: *"Without thought, without action, silently unmoving, yet responding and thus communicating with all under Heaven."*

Yangzi says: *"Plow the Dao and obtain the Dao; hunt virtue and obtain virtue."*

Mencius says: *"Self-obtained."*

When self-obtained, one encounters the source on all sides. When study reaches the point of encountering the source on all sides, then where does one go without carrying it?

The so-called "obtaining" refers to obtaining this.

Ah! The mystery of the Dao suffices to exhaust the nature of all things. The subtlety of the Dao suffices to fathom the principles of all things. Nature and mystery are one in profundity, and the so-called having and not having—can they not be observed together and dualistically extinguished?

Some say: *"Having having, not having not having—what does this mean?"* This speaks of how having and not having alternate thus: not having is true having, having is true not having. Having and not having interdependently arise, never differing.

The Classic says: *"These two emerge together but have different names. They are called **Xuan** because its color is dark and faint, red and black, yin and yang mingling in steam—all unified."*

The *Yijing* says: *"One yin and one yang is called the Dao; the unfathomable yin and yang is called the Spirit."* Yin and yang, having and not having, are all unified.

Unified in one, yet not yet mysterious in one; mysterious in one, yet not yet mysterious in multiplicity; mysterious in multiplicity, yet not yet mysterious in self and things. Hence, it is said: *"Spirit is the mysterious speech of all things."*

**Xuan** beyond **Xuan**, then one and multiplicity, self and things—all are mysteriously unified. This is the so-called gate of all mysteries.

Thus, Laozi begins his first chapter with the profound meaning of **repeated Xuan**, reaching the most profound and distant principles, which cannot be exceeded. This is what students should devote their hearts to.

Program Tai-zhi says: *"The Dao that can be spoken of reaches the unnameable."* Without distinctions of self/other, past/future, always thus—this is its constancy. If it can do this but not that, if it was once thus but is not now, then it cannot be called constant.

Before the Dao becomes virtue, it is indistinct and boundless, encompassing all things in one. Within it, it can be firm or yielding, real or empty, short or long, responding to all stimuli with countless differences, yet not adhering to any particular thing or event—so what can it not respond to, what can it not accomplish?

---
*(Note: "重玄" [chóng xuán] is rendered as "repeated Xuan" to preserve the layered profundity, though "double mystery" or "ultimate mystery" could also serve. "恍惚" [huanghu] is "obscurity and confusion," a Daoist term for the ineffable state beyond duality.)*

The absence of distinctions between self and other, past and future—this is its constancy. Those who grasp the Dao understand its boundless essence and thus speak clearly of its unchanging nature, calling it *constant*.

When the Dao manifests as virtue, virtue solidifies into principles—*ren* (benevolence), *yi* (righteousness), *li* (ritual), *zhi* (wisdom)—all dwelling within the Dao yet unfolding into specific deeds. Once named and defined, they adhere to particular forms and limits. Thus, this virtue cannot encompass other virtues, nor can its name serve as another’s. Therefore, what can be spoken of as the Dao is no longer the *constant Dao*, and what can be named is not the *constant Name*.

The unnamed is the origin of heaven and earth.
Heaven and earth—governing all creation, opening and closing, generating and transforming—are already vast within their domain. Yet Laozi further ascends beyond them, establishing another category and naming it *Wu* (the Non-being). He declares that this *Wu* is what can be called the origin of heaven and earth. Such claims, the Confucian scholars doubt as empty boasts.

Yet the *Yijing*’s two principles (*yin* and *yang*) are heaven and earth, but what gives rise to them is truly the *Taiji* (Supreme Ultimate). The *Taiji* is neither heaven nor earth, yet it encompasses both, standing supreme. At that stage, no forms exist to be cast aside, no numbers to be counted—thus Laozi renames it *Wu*. Though their names differ, their essence is the same. His disciples knew later ages would doubt this, so Zhuangzi framed a question and answered it himself:

*"If form arises from the formless, how did heaven and earth come to be?"*
Thus, it is said that *Wu* gives rise to heaven and earth.
Even Zhuangzi knew people would doubt, so he clarified: Before heaven and earth formed, within the formless there were four stages: *Taiyi* (Great Unity), *Taichu* (Great Commencement), *Taishi* (Great Beginning), *Taosu* (Great Primordial)—this is their order. Though their *qi*, form, and substance were present yet undivided, they could only be called *hunlun* (indistinct chaos).

Only when movement and transformation occurred did the light and clear rise as heaven, the heavy and turbid settle as earth. Thus, the *Taiji* is precisely that which dwells in emptiness, embracing both purity and turbidity, establishing itself in an unmatched state of non-action. Is this not the indistinct yet formless?

Laozi names it *Wu*, preceding heaven and earth—this aligns with the *Yijing*’s logic.

The named is the mother of all things.
A later passage states: *"All things under heaven arise from the having; having arises from the non-being."* When it is *Wu*, it is simply vast and boundless. Yet all things emerge from it, so calling *Wu* the origin of heaven and earth is still plausible. But once it enters *You* (the having), how does it differ from other things, yet still generate them?

It is the *Wu* that has stirred yet not yet solidified into things. Examining its boundaries, it is the *hunlun*—about to move but not yet manifest. On the verge of being named *Wu*, it already differs from *Wu*; on the verge of being called *wu* (thing), it lacks defined form. Thus, studying its core, it is named *You*.

When it fully takes shape and is called *wanwu* (ten thousand things), they are all fixed in form and substance: heaven and earth, sun and moon, rain and dew, mountains and rivers, grasses and trees, humans and beasts, tools and vessels—all clearly defined, not merely *You*.

Laozi describes this *You* in three shifting names, yet they share one essence. Numerically, it is *One*—capable of generating all yet not yet all. Figuratively, it is *Xiang* (image); practically, it is *Pu* (uncarved block). *Xiang* and *Pu* can both become form and vessel, yet their form and vessel remain uncoagulated. Thus, above it is not yet *Wu*, below it is not yet *wu*—this *You* transcends past and future, self and other, as the eternal progenitor of all things. Hence, a later passage declares: *"All things under heaven have a beginning, which is the mother of all things under heaven."* Zhuangzi’s theory of origins stems from this.

Laozi himself knew this truth would be hard to grasp at once, so he further explained, moving from the whole to the particular: *"There is a thing, indistinctly formed, existing before heaven and earth. Silent and boundless, it stands alone yet never changes, revolves eternally yet leaves no trace—it can be the mother of all things under heaven. I do not know its name; I call it the Dao, forcefully name it the Great."*

*Mixing and forming*—this is the undivided state. It is the indistinct unity of *Wu* and *You* before differentiation. Existing before heaven and earth, it is where they truly originate. Standing alone, revolving eternally, it is the mother of all things under heaven—truly without a child, yet the source of all.

These three aspects encompass the origin of all things and phenomena under heaven. Laozi’s text omits what the *Six Classics* already elaborate, yet delves deeply into what they leave unexplored. The *Six Classics* exhaust the discussion of governance when reaching the Dao, but Laozi ascends beyond the Dao’s mother—heaven and earth—to higher realms: *Wu*, *Xuan*, and *repeated Xuan*—these are its domains.

Yet once the distinctions lie beyond these three aspects, they become beyond what can be spoken of as the Dao or named at all.

Since there is no name to invoke, yet one must speak from this realm to awaken the unenlightened—where then shall words be anchored?

Thus, transcending what can be spoken of or named, he establishes the dual categories of *You* and *Wu*, to convey his intent.

This is the overarching principle of his teaching.

Once these two categories are named, the scope of his discourse becomes accessible to all, allowing each to follow and infer its meaning.

When speaking of *Wu*, one knows his intent must lie before heaven and earth.
When speaking of *You*, one knows his intent must lie beyond all things.

Thus, though his text meanders in intricate ways, its myriad passages never stray from the dual principles of *You* and *Wu*.

Yet *You* and *Wu* were already discussed in the *Six Classics*, differing only in that the *Six Classics* never spoke of them in isolation.

The *Yijing*’s references to "without thought, without action, without form, without substance" indeed speak of *Wu*, yet thought, action, form, and substance are merely adjuncts—never wholly abandoned to stand alone as *Wu*.

Laozi’s innovation here lies in addressing the moment before creation had any manifestation, where even thought, action, form, and substance had not yet taken shape.

His intent, it seems, is to position himself within *Wu*, placing the *Six Classics* in the realm of already-formed things.

His aspirations are indeed lofty and distant, yet his words imply what may not exist.

Yet his distinctions are clear, his principles consistent throughout, and all may be examined and verified.

Confucian scholars also draw from this lineage, though many misinterpret his text by conflating *Dao* and *qi*, forcing shallow reasoning into profound mysteries—thus distorting and confusing it.

Why not test his teachings with concrete examples? Zhang Liang’s tranquility, Cao Parameter’s serenity, and Emperor Wen’s silent governance—these are instances where Laozi’s teachings, though not fully implemented in the Zhou, bore fruit in the Han.

In applying Laozi’s principles, they stand as the foremost models across the ages.

Yet did these rulers ever truly withdraw from worldly affairs? They simply refused to burden themselves with personal desires, so their reverence for *Wu*’s power—though not fully realizing the Dao—sufficed to cultivate emptiness and still chaos, never entangling themselves in worldly matters.

By the time of the Western Jin, however, rituals, music, laws, and governance were abandoned in favor of absolute *Wu*, leaving no structure or order, and the Jin dynasty collapsed in chaos. Thus, those who study Laozi must recognize that within *wuwei* lies *wu buwei*—what is not done—and only then can they understand how Han and Jin governance, though rooted in the same source, produced such divergent outcomes.

As for those who falsely claim *wuwei* as their practice, naming themselves Daoists while fabricating absurd tales of transcendence, fortune, and misfortune, these are not Laozi’s words.

Tracing their origins, tales of immortality arose in the Warring States, while prayers for retribution and responses flourished in the Han—yet none of this appears in the *Eighty-One Chapters*.

Should students of Laozi adhere to the original eighty-one chapters, or to the later embellishments of fantastical speech?

Should rulers and ministers emulate Zhang Liang, Cao Parameter, and Emperor Wen, or the reckless excesses of the Jin and the bizarre later traditions?

These are clear lessons—easy to discern, yet essential to heed.

Ever without desire, one may observe its boundaries.

The capacity to generate the **Having** from the **Non-Having**, yet not claiming itself as the **Having**, is how one may perpetually abide in the **Non-Having**.

The capacity to generate **Things** from the **Having**, yet not claiming itself as **Things**, is how one may perpetually abide in the **Having**.

How so? Before form and substance take root, within there is no separation or interruption, hence it may be perpetuated. But when one derives form and substance from **Creation-Transformation** (造化), and emerges from the **Dao/Way** to manifest as **virtue/power** (德), **benevolence**, **righteousness**, **propriety**, and **ritual**, these are all **Things**.

When these **Things** are perpetually congealed without dispersion, they may be named. If the **Having** is dispersed, then there is **Non-Having**. Thus, once the **Having** has become **Things**, all that has ever taken form cannot master its own **Having**.

When myriad **Things** arise together in their **keynote** (芸芸) state, and those that return to their root and wither become **bare** (枯秃), they may be awaited. For those who already possess the **Having**, since it cannot be retained, they revert to **command** (复命), and when the **stillness** (静) of the **Non-Having** once more overflows like spring’s nourishment, all that emerges in **keynote** cannot restrain itself, and thus retreats into the **Non-Having**.

The **Dao/Way’s** attainment or loss, along with the **spokes-and-hub** (辐毂) and **door-and-window** (户牖) of its implements—all are governed by a single principle. Thus, the **Having** and **Non-Having** of the world are insufficient to trace the **outer and inner** (表里) of the **Great Dao/Way**.

Those who perpetually abide in **Non-Having** are the **Dao/Way’s** essence yet to emerge. Those who perpetually abide in the **Having** are the **Dao/Way’s** movement already tending toward emergence.

These are all **Things** yet not ensnared by **Things**, hence they may encompass all **Creation-Transformation** without being consumed by it. With their dwelling in totality and their substance embracing all, the beginning and end of the **Great Dao/Way** may be sought within them.

That which is called **Mysterious** (妙) dwells in the depths of **Creation-Transformation**, where all **Having** originates. This is the **Non-Having** yet to be encompassed by totality.

That which is called **Boundary** (徼) is the **edge**, like the four corners of a frontier marking the boundaries of a central kingdom. It is the **Non-Having** that has emerged as **Having**, yet has not yet fully become **Things**. Hence it cannot be called **Mysterious** and is perpetually the **Boundary**.

With these two distinctions established, the **outer and inner** (表里) of the **Dao/Way** may be measured. To attain **Non-Having** and dwell within it is to explore the origin of all **Having** and perceive its **inner**; to attain the **Having** and dwell within it is to exhaust the production of all **Things** and perceive their **outer**.

Thus, Laozi esteems the perpetuation of **Non-Having** and **Having**, for within them the **outer and inner** of the **Dao/Way** may be imagined.

Zhuangzi said: *"Those who perceive the **Having** are the virtuous gentlemen of old; those who perceive the **Non-Having** are the friends of Heaven and Earth."* This aligns with the principle.

The *Book of Changes* (《易》) states: *"That which is above form is called the **Dao/Way**; that which is below form is called the **instrument** (器)."* The **Dao/Way** is the **instrument**, and the **instrument** is the **Dao/Way**. It is merely that their forms are above or below, not that they are two distinct entities.

This **Mysterious** and **Boundary** are the *Book of Changes*’s **above** and **below**. Those who abandon the **above** and **below** yet name it **Mysterious** and **Boundary** seek only to establish their own school, though their ultimate intent is not fundamentally different.

In the world, how could there be anything below that lacks support and yet stands empty above? Or anything **inner** without its **outer**?

This is the mutual reliance of **Dao/Way** and **instrument**, **Having** and **Non-Having**, clearly evident and easily understood. Hence, they are borrowed to illustrate that within the discourse on **Mysterious**, **Boundary** is never neglected.

These two are of the same origin yet bear different names. The **Having** is **Boundary** to the **Non-Having**, while the **Non-Having** is **Mysterious** to the **Having**. When they have already emerged, the **Having** and **Non-Having** may indeed be divided. But before emergence, they are indistinguishably merged, hence it is said they are the same.

The same is **One**. **One** is not yet **One**, for from it the **Three** may generate the **Myriad**, yet it has not yet reached the **Myriad**.

The *Book of Changes* and the Five Classics, as well as the *Discourses* (《论》) and *Mencius* (《孟》), have all spoken of **One**, yet none have explained how it is **One**.

Laozi’s disciples, however, have elaborately expounded upon this. They speak of **"indistinct unity"** (混成), **"indistinctly merged"** (浑沦), and **"indistinct chaos"** (浑沌)—all describing its undivided state.

From its emergence before division, it is named **"same"** (同); from its **Non-Having** and **matching"** (匹) not yet being so, it is named **"alone"** (独); and from its **Non-Having** not being otherwise, it is named **"perpetual"** (常). All these terms emphasize its totality and clarify its essence.

When the **Non-Having** has emerged as **Having** yet not fully become **Things**, it is again given distinctions—named **"One"** (一), **"Uncarved"** (朴), or **"Form"** (象)—all taken from its capacity to encompass the **Myriad** in unity, for the names arise from what it contains.

Thus, Laozi’s discourse on the **Dao/Way** is particularly detailed here. Though its branches and leaves may greatly diverge from Confucian teachings, even Confucians cannot help but draw upon its **Mysterious** insights.

Hence, the profound in **Dao/Way** can still align the disparate to serve the unified; while the shallow in **Dao/Way**, to the point of declaring that Confucius does not belong to a single school, are like those who pass through a doorway yet fail to recognize the halls and chambers within.

The unified is called **Dark** (玄). Five colors find **black** as their **Dark**, Heaven’s color is **Dark** in its boundless expanse, the **Great Dark** (太玄) of the **Vague** (罔) is direct, and in winter, all **Things** return to their root, **revert to command** (复命), without visible boundaries—this is named **Dark**.

Thus, **Dark** refers to the **profound and distant**. The *Liezi*’s statement that *"the **Dao/Way** is formless and ends in the **Dark**"* is precisely this teaching.

The unified is called **Dark**, for **Having** and **Non-Having** merge, indistinctly merged without separation, hence it may be called **profound and distant**.

If their traces are faintly discernible, then the **Non-Having** is truly hidden within the **Non-Having**, while the **Having** is truly formed within the **Having**. Once distinctions begin to emerge, it cannot again be called **Dark**.

The **Dark** beyond **Dark**, is the gateway to myriad **Mysterious** insights. When all **Having** is indistinctly merged into **Non-Having**, it has reached its extreme.

Now, advancing further upward, there is yet another **Dark**. The **Non-Having** advancing into **Dark** becomes ever more profound. And beyond the **Dark**, there is yet another **Dark**, its principle being what?

Zhuangzi and Liezi have indeed illuminated this.

「In Liezi’s discourse, there are **Too-Easy** (*Tà Yì*), **Too-Primordial** (*Tà Chū*), **Too-Beginning** (*Tà Shǐ*), and **Too-Substantial** (*Tà Sù*), all of which are the **Qi** (*Qi*) and form’s foundation for the myriad.

When descending through these four stages in sequence, and reaching the **Light and Pure** Heaven (*Qīng Qīng zhī Tiān*) and the **Heavy and Impure** Earth (*Zhòng Zhuó zhī Dì*), one may observe their order: **Having** advances to **Non-Having**, **Non-Having** further advances to **Dark**, and **Dark** advances yet again to **Darkness**—their successive ranks are clearly discernible.

Liezi says: *“There is **Having**, and there is **Non-Having**,”*—this aligns with Laozi’s **constant Non-constant Having** (*Cháng Wúcháng Yǒu*).

Again, *“There is **Having** before **Having** and **Non-Having**,”*—this is Laozi’s **Dark**.

Again, *“There is **Having** before **Having** and **Non-Having**, before **Having** and **Non-Having**,”*—this is the **Dark** beyond **Dark**.

All are insights perceived by the mind yet unnamed by the world, expressed through thought and forced into speech.

Laozi’s words—**“stillness, emptiness, profound and distant”** (*Jìliáo Yǎomiǎo*)—truly describe the state of **Dark** and **Dark** beyond **Dark**, while Zhuangzi further expands them as **“dim and silent, murky and obscure”** (*Hūn Mò Qí Jīn*).

Only **constant Non-Having** (*Cháng Wú*), which can encompass the **Mysterious** essence of all **Having**, is the true source from which the **Dark** beyond **Dark** emerges.

In later chapters, the **multitude of myriad** (*Zhòng Fǔ*) and **Zhuangzi’s hundred transformations** (*Bǎi Chāng*), along with the myriad beauties, all follow this same **Mysterious** principle, yet are clarified in their own terms.

Since the advent of written records, the **Dao/Way** of sages’ wisdom, virtue, and righteousness has been revealed in the *Yì* and confirmed by the governance of the **Five Three** (*Wǔ Sān*)—the **Six Classics**. From ancient times to the present, the world relies on them for sustenance, like the **Five Grains** and **Cloth of Raw Silk** (*Bùmáo*), without which life cannot thrive, and with which it flourishes. None can replace them, nor is there another principle as profound.

Yet Laozi establishes a teaching that seeks to utterly abandon sages’ wisdom, virtue, and righteousness, and revert to the **beginning of knotted cords** (*Jiégǒu*).

Those who take the **Six Classics** as their profession collectively uphold and reject this teaching, even labeling his work as a **heretical doctrine**. Yet the **Ten Thousand Words** (*Wàn Yī Yán*) persist alongside the **Six Classics**, never truly discarded—why is this?

The **Six Classics** elucidate **rites and laws**, so their texts are all about **instruments** (*Qì*). Yet regarding the **Dao/Way**, they offer only a brief outline.

Laozi exhausts the **Dao/Way** in its **constant Non-Having** (*Cháng Wú*), yet omits mention of **instruments** (*Qì*).

Though their focus differs—one detailed, the other sparse—**instruments** (*Qì*) bear the **Dao/Way**, and the **Dao/Way** generates **instruments** (*Qì*). They cannot be separated into two distinct paths.

Seeking the **Dao/Way**, one must ascend from lower learning to higher attainment, yet the **Six Classics** do not fully explore its depths.

Laozi, however, has fully expounded its profound essence.

Thus, those who study the **Dao/Way** and glimpse its truth find no language in the **Six Classics** to verify it, and so they align with Laozi’s words to elucidate its **virtue/power** (*Dé*).

Hence, though his teaching appears contradictory to theirs, the **Dao/Way** remains concurrent—there is good reason for this.

Ah! This principle is subtle indeed, too profound to be grasped in a single utterance.

Now, let me take the most accessible yet closest examples from ancient times to clarify it, so all may understand.

**Agriculture** is the foundation of civilization, yet its practice is the most coarse.

The teachings of the **Six Classics** speak of the timing for plowing, sowing, harvesting, and storing—of the tools before the **plow** (*Sì*), **hoe** (*Chuán*), **weeder** (*Zhì*), and **reaper** (*Zhì*). These are the most **concrete** (*Xíng*) and **lowly** (*Yuè*) of all **instruments** (*Qì*).

Yet the transformations of the four seasons depend on these **instruments** for their manifestation, and the seeds of a hundred grains achieve their fullness through them.

Even if the **original Qi** of Heaven and Earth is beyond naming, it still relies on these **instruments** to manifest its functions—how can one claim the **Dao/Way** is absent simply because its tools are present?

As for Laozi’s **Dao/Way**, he exhausts its utmost **Mysterious** essence.

He rejects the governance of **eastern labor and western harvest** (*Dōng Zuò Xī Chéng*), yet even in his texts, though he speaks of all things arising and returning to their roots—too numerous to enumerate—he still provides tools for **planting** (*Zhòng*), **harvesting** (*Shuō*), **nurturing** (*Yǎng*), and **pruning** (*Fá*).

Yet Laozi never utters a word on these matters.

When discussing the **subtle** and **Mysterious**, he still considers the **hinge of Heaven and Earth’s transformations** (*Tiān Dì Shēnghuà zhī Shuā*) and the **beginning of virtue and Dao** (*Dé Dào Yǔncáng zhī Shǐ*) as shallow, directly probing the origins of Heaven and Earth—**“how did Heaven and Earth come to be Heaven and Earth?”**—and the **Dark Non-Having**—**“how could the **Dark Non-Having** be **Dark Non-Having**?”**—only to name them in accordance with his intent.

Thus, his teaching seems entirely distinct from the **Six Classics**.

Yet, by examining his spoken words to infer what he does not say, and by seeking what he cannot help but imply despite his reluctance to speak openly, one finds that **virtue** (*Dé*), **righteousness** (*Rén*), and **rites** (*Yì*) are never truly absent, nor are **taxes** (*Shuì*), **punishments** (*Xíng*), **military force** (*Bīng*), **criminal law** (*Xíng*), and the **practical tools of daily life**—**chickens, dogs, boats, and carts** (*Jī Quǎn Zhōuchē*).

Though his words often exalt **Non-Having**, they never truly abandon **Having**.

In the first chapter, he reaches the extreme of **Dark** beyond **Dark**, yet he transcends the myriad **Mysterious** and governs their emergence.

When observing **Having**, it frequently appears in contrast with the **Mysterious** and **Non-Having**, standing parallel yet distinct—this **Having** and these **instruments** (*Qì*) are never truly separate.

Sages’ wisdom, virtue, and righteousness are never truly discarded.

Thus, when reading Laozi’s words, within the utmost **Non-Having**, one finds the **virtue/power** (*Dé*) of all **Having** and **Mysterious**—it must originate from **tracing** (*Jiànjì*).

Huang Maocai says: *“The **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of is not the **constant Non-Having**.”*

**Constant** (*Cháng*) here means **enduring** and **permanent**.

The **Dao/Way** begins and ends with Heaven and Earth—how could it be anything but enduring and permanent? Who could truly speak of it?

If the **Dao/Way** could be spoken of and named, then the world’s understanding would suffice as **constant**.

The Classics say: *“I do not know its name, so I call it **Dao/Way**.”*

The **Dao/Way** is singular and absolute—why then does it oppose **name** (*Míng*)?

Laozi’s intent is to reveal the **enduring and permanent** **Dao/Way** to people, is it not?

**Non-Having** is the **mother of myriad things**.

At the **beginning of Heaven and Earth**, was there truly **Non-Having**?

If there was indeed **Non-Having**, who then gave rise to it?

**Non-Having** is **Non-Naming**—**Non-Naming** is **Non-Having**—it cannot be named, so it is called thus.»

「When it has already come into existence, does it truly have something? It is only named thus to emphasize its power.

The Classics say: *“Vague and indistinct, yet within it there is form; indistinct and vague, yet within it there are things.”*
And again: *“Things are formed in a chaotic unity.”*
All these are forced names.

The term **"Non-Having"** (母) refers to its capacity to generate things.
Only after Heaven and Earth came into being did myriad things arise—thus, the sequence is first Heaven and Earth, then myriad things. His words follow this order.

**"Non-Having"** (无) and **"Non-Wanting"** (无欲) are said to reach the same state, called **"Mysterious"** (玄).
The Classics speak of **"Not Wanting"** (不欲), **"Few Wants"** (寡欲), and **"Desires Abundant"** (可欲多矣). Now, if one says **"Non-Wanting"** (无欲) and **"Having Wants"** (有欲), then it aligns with the Classics’ words.

Yet, **"Non-Wanting"** (无欲) may be called **"constant"** (常), but can **"Having Wants"** (有欲) also be called **"constant"** (常)?
One replies: Since things came into existence, those with **nine orifices** (*jiǔqiào*) are born from the womb, and those with **eight orifices** (*bāqiào*) are born from eggs—all due to desire. Desire begets life, which begets more life, and this cycle has no end. Thus, even **"Having Wants"** (有欲) may be called **"constant"** (常).

People know that **"Non-Having"** (无) arises from the **Dao/Way** (*Dào*), but they do not know that **"Having"** (有) also arises from the **Dao/Way** (*Dào*).
How could they know that both **"Having"** and **"Non-Having"** emerge from the **"Mysterious"** (玄)?

The **"Mysterious"** (玄) deepens into **"Mysterious Again"** (玄之又玄), the gateway to all wonders.

**Nánbó Zǐ Kuài** said to **Rǔ Jiǎo**:
“Where did you hear this from?”
She replied: *“I heard it from **Fù Mò’s son**, **Fù Mò’s son** heard it from **Luò Sòng’s grandson**, **Luò Sòng’s grandson** heard it from **Zhān Míng**, **Zhān Míng** heard it from **Niè Xǔ**, **Niè Xǔ** heard it from **Xū Yì**, **Xū Yì** heard it from **Yú Diàn**, **Yú Diàn** heard it from **Xuán Míng**, and **Xuán Míng** heard it from **Cān Liáo**, **Cān Liáo** heard it from **Yí Shǐ**.”

The **Dao/Way** grows ever more subtle yet ever more present; it becomes ever more refined yet cannot be exhausted.
Even **Rǔ Jiǎo** heard it and reached **Yí Shǐ**—**"Mysterious Again"** (玄之又玄)—this is evident in her words.
Thus, it is the gateway to all wonders.

---

#1 From *Lǎozǐ’s* **"Exhausting the Dao/Way without end"** (穷道未故常): The character **"未"** (*wèi*) should likely be read as **"末"** (*mò*).

**Volume Three of *The Collected Meanings of the *Dào Dé* *Zhēn Jīng*** (道德真经集义卷之三): *Níng Yuǎn Dàshī’s* **"Observing the Mysterious Path of Constant Virtue"** (常德路玄妙观).」

The **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of is the gateway to the **Dao/Way**.

When the **Dao/Way** can be named, it is the **Dao/Way** of transient convention, not the **Dao/Way** of eternal, indestructible nature.
When a **name** can be fixed, it is the **name** of transient value, not the **name** of enduring, indescribable worth.

The **Dao/Way** cannot be confined by elevation or suppression in argument.
Thus, it is said above: "That which cannot be named," the origin of the chaotic **Heaven** and **Earth**,
and "That which can be named," the mother of all things born.

Hence, when one remains without **desire** yet stirs within the mind,
it suffices to observe the **Dao/Way**’s profound subtlety;
when one abides with **desire** yet moves in outward **emotion**,
it suffices to observe the **Dao/Way**’s shifting manifestations.

These two arise from the same **Dao/Way**, yet differ in subtle and manifest forms—
thus they are both called **"Mysterious"** (玄).

**"Mysterious Again"** (玄之又玄), yet all-pervasive,
this is the gateway to all wonders.

The **Dao/Way**’s subtlety defies naming,
so this chapter first names it as the mother of all things born,
then as the shifting manifestations of **desire**,
and as the **"Mysterious"** origin.
**"Mysterious Again"** is the gateway to all wonders.

To say "mother," "manifestations," "gateway"—
is this not the progression from essence to form,
from embodying the **Dao/Way** to attaining its wondrous applications?

**Zhāng Chōng Yìng** replied: The **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of is the gateway to the **Dao/Way**.

The **Great Dao/Way** is formless, giving birth to **Heaven** and **Earth**.
The **Great Dao/Way** is nameless, nurturing all things.
Humans cannot embody this natural **Dao/Way**,
yet they cling to the **Dao/Way** of scriptures and governance,
seeking fame, display, and the attainment of transient **names**.

The **Dao/Way** they speak of is the **Dao/Way** that can be attained by the world,
not the **Dao/Way** of eternal, unerodible nature.
The **name** they speak of is the **name** that can be attained by the world,
not the **name** of far-reaching, indescribable worth.

To embody the **Dao/Way** that cannot be named is to be nameless;
to embody the **Dao/Way** that can be named is to have a **name**.
Nameless, the **Dao/Way** is vast—
like **Heaven** covering and **Earth** bearing,
chaotic in its origin, yet unknown to humans as the source of covering and bearing.
Named, the **Dao/Way** is small—
like all things sprouting and branching,
distinguishing good and evil, each having its **name**.

The root of their good and evil is called the nameless **Dao/Way**,
the beginning of **Heaven** and **Earth**.
The named is the mother of all things.

Between **Heaven** and **Earth**, humans live with flesh and blood as their body,
the mind governing the five senses.
When embodying the **Dao/Way**, there is the ability to rest within my **desire**-less stillness,
to observe the **Dao/Way** that cannot be spoken of or named;
and to move in outward **desire**,
to observe the **Dao/Way**’s shifting manifestations.
Thus, I attain its essence and know the world’s shifting inclinations.

This **desire** of mine and the world’s, both arising from the same mind yet differing in **name**,
is called **"Mysterious"**.
I esteem the **"Mysterious"** of **desire**-lessness,
while the world esteems the **"Mysterious"** of **desire** as equally noble.
Observing the world’s **"Mysterious"** of **desire**,
then reflecting upon my own **"Mysterious"** of **desire**-lessness,
this is the crucial ground for advancing and refining the **Great Dao/Way**—
this is called the gateway to all wonders.

**Zhāng Líng Yìng** said: Nameless, it is the beginning of **Heaven** and **Earth**.
Named, it is the mother of all things.

The **Dao/Way** is originally nameless,
but through **qi** transformation it gains **name**.
**Qi** emerging from the nameless has no **name** to be fixed—
**Heaven** clears, **Earth** settles, and the **Dao/Way** begins from here.
**Qi** coalescing into form has **names** to be fixed—
branches, leaves, and kinds all trace back to their mother.
**Qi** transforms into things,
things contain the **Dao/Way**—
humans are but one thing among them.
To trace its origin and guard its mother,
this is the path to entering the **Dao/Way**.

**Bái Yù Chán** said:
The **Dao/Way**—
nothing more than this.
That which can be spoken of is not the **Dao/Way**.
That which can be said is not as it is.
The **name** is a forced designation of the **Dao/Way**.
That which can be named is not the true **name**.
To call it the **Dao/Way** is already to misname it.
The **Dao/Way** is **emptiness**.

This is the **Dao/Way**.
The beginning of **Heaven** and **Earth** is called **"Unnamed"** (无).
The **Dao/Way** generates **"One"** (一), which is the initial chaos of **Heaven** and **Earth**—
**"One"** generates **"Two"** (二), **"Two"** generates **"Three"** (三),
**"Three"** generates all things.
Thus, **"One"** is named the mother of all things.

**"One"** without form generates all **"Ten Thousand Things"** (万有),
all **"Ten Thousand Things"** return to **"One"** without form—
hence, one must always remain with an **emptiness**-filled mind,
without thought,
to observe its subtlety.
When one sees things, one knows the **Dao/Way**;
when one knows the **Dao/Way**, one sees the mind.
One must always guard the central **emptiness** and embrace **"One"**,
to observe its shifting manifestations.

The body has birth and death,
the mind has none—
these two are the **"Ten Thousand"** (万) and the **"One"** (一).
**"One"** without form is also without form—
within the **emptiness** there is no **emptiness**,
same origin yet different **names**—
all **dharma/laws** return to **"One"**,
the mind is fundamentally **emptiness**—
thus they are both called **"Mysterious"**.

The **Dao/Way** is not **emptiness**-seeking **desire**;
**emptiness** naturally returns.
Humans, when they achieve **emptiness**-filled minds,
the **Dao/Way** naturally returns to **"One"**.

**"Mysterious Again"**—
within **emptiness**, the true is hidden;
from **emptiness**, form arises—
the gateway to all wonders.
Awakening enters from here,
its application is endless.

**Liào Cuì Rán** said:
The **Dao/Way**—
the **Dao/Way** of **Primordial Beginning** (元始) can be spoken of,
and is called the **Dao/Way**, yet it is not the **Dao/Way**,
nor the ordinary **Dao/Way** spoken of by the world.
The **name**—
the **name** of the **Supreme Primordial** (太上) can be fixed,
and is called the **Dao/Way**, yet it is not the true **name**,
nor the common **name** invoked by all.

**"Unnamed"** (无)—
**"Unnamed"** (无极) is named the beginning of **Heaven** and **Earth**,
the **Supreme Primordial** (太初) initiating birth.
The **"Great Polarity"** (太极) is named the mother of all things.

**Movement** and **stillness** are mutually rooted—
always relying on this pillar and guide,
using **desire** to observe its subtlety.
The **yellow middle** (黄中) harmonizes principles,
correctly positioned within the body,
its beauty contained within,
flowing through the four limbs—
always abiding with **desire** is like this **eye** (眦),
often guarding the **form**,
using **desire** to observe its shifting manifestations.

To sever limbs and discard wisdom,
to abandon form and discard intellect,
to align with the **Great Dao/Way**—
these two arise from the same **qi**,
yet differ in **name**,
the first three three, the latter three three—
both are called **"Mysterious"**, yet they converge in **"One"**.

**"Mysterious Again"**—
as it is, as it is—
the gateway to all wonders.
The wondrous mystery of gathering **"One"** into **"Ten Thousand"**
and dispersing **"Ten Thousand"** into **"One"**, endless generation.

**Chén Bì Xū** said:
The **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of is not the **Dao/Way**.

The **Dao/Way** is vast and difficult to speak of—
not something the divine mouth can discern.
Thus the mind is perplexed and cannot know,
the tongue falters and cannot discuss it—
it lies within the human **spiritual treasury** (*lingfu*), to be self-awakened alone.

It is called **"Non-Action"**—
for it is **naturally** so.

Now, to label the **Dao/Way** is already to impose a name,
and thus it belongs to the **"speakable"** realm.
Once it is said to be **"speakable"**, then there are changes and shifts,
words and explanations—
this is no different from teachings and doctrines, mere dregs of wisdom.

Let us attempt to raise what should be kept silent,
and from instruction explain:
**"Dao"** means **"pervasive"**—
speaking of how all things, obtaining it, find no obstruction,
no boundary.

It is also called **"Dao"**—**"to tread"**—
taking the path as its metaphor.
*The Classic of Graphs* says: **"Dao"** is **"the way one walks."**
One path leads—this is called **"Dao."**

Ancient sages and modern scholars embody and practice it,
thus it is called **"Dao."**

As for **benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust**—
the five **constants**—
these are all the **applications** of **Dao**.

When applied, it is called **"speakable."**
Once **"speakable"** is made clear,
then it is no longer the **"unspeakable."**

The **"unspeakable Dao"** is **naturally** so,
responding to stimuli, adapting without end.
It cannot be transmitted by words,
cannot be sought by intellect—
only by embodying the **mysteries of transformation**,
containing light, hiding radiance,
doing **Non-Action** yet accomplishing all—
silently attaining its utmost.

**Yán Jūn Píng** said:
The **"speakable Dao"**—
when **virtue/power** and **Dao** are made manifest,
they are no longer **natural**.

He also said:
Those who now hold **Dao** but do not wield it like a torch—
they claim to be **"enlightened."**
But **"enlightened"** is the **Dao** that is **not the Dao**—
the **"unspeakable."**
To wield a torch is to make the **"speakable Dao"** manifest.

What is inscribed on bamboo and silk,
carved into metal and stone,
what can be passed to others—
this is the **"speakable Dao."**

But what can be transmitted yet not received,
what can be obtained yet not seen—
its roots and origins,
before heaven and earth existed,
from ancient times onward, eternally abiding—
the **spirits, gods, and divine emperors** who gave birth to heaven and earth—
this is the **"unspeakable Dao."**

The **Five Thousand Characters** unfold from these few words,
truly the **"profound yet deeper"**,
the **"divine yet more divine."**

What can be named is not the **true name**.
The **Dao** is **embodiment**,
**name** is its **application**.
Application arises from embodiment,
names emerge from the **Dao**.
Once a name is given,
it can be invoked in use.
When use is established,
it is called **"nameable."**
Once **"nameable"** is fixed,
it is no longer the **"true name."**

The **"true name"** refers to its boundless applications,
fragmenting its **virtue/power**.
**Yán Jūn Píng** said:
The **"nameable name"**—
when **achievement and reputation** are displayed,
they are not the **original truth**.

**Lǐ Zǐ**, dwelling in the **Jīng Garden** for forty years,
no one recognized him—
the king and ministers treated him like commoners.
This was truly one who guarded the **"true name."**

Thus, the **Dao** is always **nameless**—
this is what is meant.

**"Nameless"** is the beginning of heaven and earth.
**"Nameless"** refers to the **Dao** itself.
Before the ten thousand transformations took form,
there was no imposed name—
only the **mystery of origins** descending,
the **primordial simplicity** about to disperse—
then the **Great Polarity** of the *Yì Jīng* emerged.

**Yán Jūn Píng** said:
**"Nameless"** and **"no trace"**—
uniting with the **Divine**,
the world relies upon it,
yet none know how it transforms from **emptiness**—
the beginning of heaven and earth.
This is the **embodiment of Dao**.

**"Named"** is the **mother of all things**.
**"Named"** refers to heaven and earth.
Heaven nurtures, earth transforms—
nourishing all things,
protecting and harming them like a mother to her child.
Thus it is called **"Named,"** the **mother of all things**.

The **Great Dao** is vast and obscure—
how could it be bound by **"Named"** or **"Nameless"**?
Moreover, the sage adapts use to establish teachings,
to clarify the **principles and traces** of **Dao**—
the **new teachings** of each age
are all called **"Nameless."**
Thus, what **begins** all things is **"Nameless,"**
what **completes** all things is **"Named."**

**Yán Jūn Píng** said:
The **"Named"** in its **transformations**—
honors **virtue/power and Dao**,
values **divine clarity**,
follows the **Great Harmony**,
aligns with heaven and earth—
thus it is the **mother of all things**.
This is the **application of Dao**.

Always **without desire**, observe its **mystery**;
always **with desire**, observe its **boundaries**.

**"Desire"** is the mind chasing after phenomena.
**"Mystery"** is the **essence**, the utmost subtlety.
**"Boundary"** is the **edge**, the **corner**—
the **Dao** has small paths at its edges,
also its **return**.

The **Dao of emptiness** is **silent and unmoving**—
this is **"without desire."**
When it **responds and gives birth** to all things—
this is **"with desire."**
**"Without desire"** observes **mystery**—
guarding **emptiness**.
**"With desire"** observes **boundaries**—
this is **contemplation**.

**"Constant"** refers to the **true and enduring**—
the **Great Dao** itself.
**"Without desire"** and **"with desire"**—
these are the **applications of Dao**.

The **Dao** originally has no form;
things **stimulate** the **Dao** to manifest.
What is **"above form"** is called **"Dao,"**
what is **"below form"** is called **"instrument."**
The **superior person** knows the subtle and the manifest,
perceiving what has not yet come and exhausting its **mystery**—
thus it is said: **"Always without desire, observe its mystery."**

The **middle person** follows along, yielding to things,
seeing their **material forms** before grasping their use—
thus there are **ten thousand differences**,
true principles are hard to fathom—
only glimpsing their **edges**.

Another explanation:
The **constant person** embodies the **Dao’s** subtlety,
guards the **essence of stillness**,
restores the **extremes of nature and life**,
not seduced by external things—
then the will and intentions are **empty and vast**,
able to observe the **Dao’s** **essence**,
reaching the **utmost of subtlety**.

**Yán Jūn Píng** said:
The heart like **metal and stone**, the form like **dry wood**,
silent and secluded, the will like a **foal or calf**—
these are the **"without desire,"** restoring the **roots of nature and life**.

Moreover, the **"with desire"** clings to phenomena,
losing the **broad path**—
only seeing the **small edges**,
lost and not returning,
losing the **true essence**.

Some ancient sages said:
The **"without desire"**—
embodies **Dao** through inner observation,
transforming all beings,
with no thoughts or storage,
forgetting their **original progress**.

The **"with desire"**—
from the **root**, applies **Dao**,
establishes teachings to respond to things,
accomplishes **benefiting all**,
sees the **end of things**,
fully knows their **return**.

「Thus, the former speaks of **restraining the self**, the latter of **transforming the people**—
to cultivate the self and govern the realm,
the **Dao/Way** is never left incomplete.

These two are the same in essence,
but the latter refers to **higher matters**—
the two being the **namable and unnamable**,
the **desiring and without desire**.

Both are contained within the **stillness and immobility** of **emptiness (寂然)**,
the **profound source (湛尔之源)**,
where **substance and function** remain indistinct,
and **good and evil** are indistinct as well—
thus they are called the same.

Yet when they manifest differently,
it means **descending from the root** to **traceable forms**,
the **Dao/Way** gradually becoming **distinct**,
though originating from the mind of one individual,
the **Five Constants (五常)** apply in varied ways—
the **virtue/power** of the wise and foolish differ,
their **transformations** are countless,
and their **lifespans and fates** diverge—
thus, when they emerge, their names differ.

The same is called **profound (玄)**,
**profound beyond profound**.

**Depth (渊)** is profound subtlety,
**obscurity (冥)**,
**heavenly (天)**.
What is called **heavenly** is **natural (自然)**.

This **namable and unnamable**,
**desiring and without desire**—
all receive **qi** from **heaven**,
and inherit their **nature** from **naturalness (自然)**,
harmonizing within and without,
assuming countless forms—
arising from **profound beyond profound**,
**spiritual beyond spiritual**,
what is called **self-so (自然而然)**.

Those who **penetrate and comprehend** this profound subtlety,
**piercing the obscurity (冥默)**—
these are called those with **profound virtue (有渊德)**.

Thus **Yán Jūn Píng** said:
**"Profound beyond profound"**—
this is what he meant, is it not?

The **gateway to all marvels (众妙之门)****
is called the **domain of the Dao/Way (道域)**.

The **Great Dao/Way** is vast and unbounded,
with no limits or confines,
no gates or byways—
it is the **august sovereign (皇皇)** of fourfold passage.

When discussed in terms of **restraining the self**,
it emerges as common to all people,
but when withdrawn, it becomes the **marvelous root**.

When taught to the masses,
the **truths (众真)** expound the marvelous and emerge,
while the **sages (群圣)** contain the marvelous and return—
their **transformation and guidance** are boundless,
yet **stillness (湛然)** remains singular,
**independent and unchanging**—
this is called **knowing the Constant (知常)**.

Since there is **entry and emergence (出入)**,
it is thus called a **gateway**.

**Zhuangzi** said:
There is the **gateway of life**,
there is the **gateway of death**,
there is the **gateway of return**—
**entry and emergence**, yet no form is seen—
this is called the **Heavenly Gateway (天门)**.

The **Heavenly Gateway** is **the Unmanifest (无有)**.
All things emerge from **the Unmanifest**,
and thus it is also called the **gateway to all marvels**.

**Xie Tu'nan** said:
**"The Dao/Way that can be named"** is the **Constant Name (至常名)**.

What is called the **Dao/Way**?
The **Classics (经)** say: **"The Dao/Way follows naturalness (自然)"**,
so the **Dao/Way** is **self-so (自然而然)**,
not something that can be **made so (使然)**.

The **Dao/Way** originally has no name;
it is called the **Dao/Way** because its **fourfold passage and eightfold reach (四通八辟)****
can be **shared and followed (共行)**,
like roads and paths.
**Mencius** said: **"The Dao/Way is like a great road."**
This is exactly what he meant.

The **"namable Dao/Way"** is like saying **"followable"**,
the **"nameable"** is like saying **"worthy of mention."**

Why does the world not follow this **Dao/Way**,
while the people use it daily without knowing?
Within the **"namable and unnamable" Dao/Way**,
there exists an **extraordinary marvel (非常之妙)**.

The **Zhōng Yōng (《中庸》)** says:
Even the **foolish commoners (夫妇之愚)** can share in **knowing**,
but when it reaches its **ultimate (至)**,
even the **sages** have things they do not know.

Even the **unworthy commoners (夫妇之不肖)** can share in **following**,
but when it reaches its **ultimate**,
even the **sages** have things they cannot do.

This is called the **"extraordinary"**—
that which is **unknowable and unattainable**, is it not?

The **Unmanifest Mother (无名至之母)** of the **ultimate**.
Before **heaven and earth** existed,
this **Dao/Way** was already present,
yet its name had not yet been established.
When the **Great Ultimate (太极)** was divided,
**heaven and earth and all things** arose from the **Dao/Way**,
holding the meaning of a **mother**,
while the **Dao/Way** itself was only later named.

Though all things arise with **ten thousand differences (万不同)**,
they share the same **mother**.

Having examined this thoroughly,
there are **forms (形)**,
there are **forms of forms (形形)***,
there are **transformations (化)**,
there are **transformations of transformations (化化)***.

**Forms** are forms indeed,
yet **forms of forms** have never truly been forms.
**Transformations** are transformations indeed,
yet **transformations of transformations** have never truly been transformations.

The **Dao/Way** is named **post-heaven**,
yet it is the **pre-heaven** that is **unnamed**.

From ancient times to the present,
**forms** arise from **qi** and **transformations**—
without beginning or end—
who is it that makes this so?

**Vague and indistinct (惚兮恍兮)**,
yet within there are **images (象)**;
**still and empty (寂兮寥兮)**,
yet **independent and unchanging**—
**effortless yet nothing is left undone (无为而无不为)***,
**nowhere yet everywhere present (无在而无不在)***—
is this not what is called the **Unnamed**?
Is this not what is called the **Extraordinary**?

Thus I say:
**Forms of forms** have never truly been forms,
**transformations of transformations** have never truly been transformations.
Hence, there is no **gateway to the Ultimate (常无至之门)**.

The **Dao/Way** is the **mother of all things**,
and **humans** are but one thing among **heaven and earth**.
Since **humans** arise from the **Dao/Way**,
then the **Dao/Way** is within **my own body**.

Thus, **desiring and without desire**—
**returning inward** to observe the **Dao/Way** within **my own self**—
this is the **foundation of cultivation (修身)** spoken of by **Lǎozǐ**.

The **marvelous (妙)** lies within—
in the **root (本)**.
The **small edges (徼)** lie without—
in the **end (末)**.

What **humans** rely upon to stand firm
is only **essence (精)** and **spirit (神)**.

The **Classics (经)** say:
**"Deep and mysterious (窈窈冥冥)"**,
within it there is **essence**—
its **essence** is most **true (甚真)**,
and within it there is **faith (信)**.

When one is **without desire**,
then **still and unmoving (寂然不动)**,
**essence and spirit** blend harmoniously—
thus one can observe its **marvelousness**.

When one is **with desire**,
then **sensations arise and pass (感而遂通)***,
**essence and spirit** separate—
thus one can observe its **small edges**.

**Essence** arises from **profound (玄)**,
**profound** being **heaven (天)**—
**heaven** first generates **water (水)**,
water’s nature is **moist and descending (润下)**,
from **Qián (乾, Heaven)** to **Kǎn (坎, Water)** as the **kidneys (肾)**—
this is the **profound** truly flowing through.

Thus it is said:
**"Same origin, different names (同出异名)"**,
**from the small edges into marvelousness (由徼入妙)**—
then the **profound** of the lower returns to the **upper**,
and one can enter the **gateway to all marvels**.

**Huán Kǎi** said:
The **gateway to the Dao’s marvels (道妙之门)***
is indeed **above Kunlun (昆仑)**.
Then one should seek it at **Qián (乾, Heaven)** as the **beginning**.

Having examined this thoroughly,
**one yin and one yang** is called the **Dao/Way**—
**self-so (自然而然)**.

**Humans** inherit **yin and yang qi** to arise,
and **desire and without desire** are also their **naturalness**.
**Essence and spirit** have the same origin,
rooted in **one heaven (一天)**—
from **marvelousness to small edges (自妙而徼)**,
**heaven** is **human**.

It is like **water**—
**one heaven** generates it,
its **source** is originally the same,
from **source to tributary to river (源祖流)***,
the same begins to differ—
thus, the **small edges** are its **river**,
the **marvelous** is its **source**.」

「The **Dao/Way** beyond the **Dao/Way**—
then one follows the **river** to trace its **source**,
and thus unites with **my heaven** in **one**.

In ancient times, **Emperor Yellow (黄帝)** ventured westward,
returning without his **marvelous pearl (玄珠)**.
He sent the **clear-eyed man (明目人)** **Lí Lóu (离娄)** to seek it,
who failed.
Then he sent **Wàng Xiàng (罔象)**, who found it.

To know **Emperor Yellow’s marvelous pearl**—
then one knows **Laozi’s** **most marvelous Dao/Way (玄玄)**.

**Lín Chǐng (林鬳斋)** said:
**"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of"**—
this passage stands at the **beginning of the book**,
and the **great essence of the entire book** is all contained here.
Its meaning is that **the Dao/Way** originally **does not admit of speech**.
Once speech is introduced, it is all **second-order meaning (第二义)**.

**"Constant"** refers to **unchangeable, immutable**—
**what can be spoken of and named** is changeable and mutable;
**what cannot be spoken of or named** is unchangeable and immutable.
With **names like benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom (仁义礼智)**,
the benevolent cannot be said to be righteousness,
the proper cannot be said to be wisdom.
With **names like spring, summer, autumn, and winter (春夏秋冬)**,
spring cannot be said to be summer,
autumn cannot be said to be winter.
Thus, **the constant Dao/Way is not the spoken Dao/Way**.

At the **beginning of heaven and earth (天地之始)**,
it was the time before **the Great Polarity (太极)*** was divided.
In **human mind**, it is the **still, unmoving state (寂然不动)**.
Before **the Great Polarity** was divided,
how could there be names like spring, summer, autumn, and winter?
In the **still, unmoving state**,
how could there be names like benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom?
Thus, it is said: **"The nameless"** is the **beginning of heaven and earth**.

When it speaks of **"heaven and earth" (天地)***,
it does not refer solely to heaven and earth.
It is a metaphor for **this mind (此心)**.

Once **yin and yang (阴阳)** are named,
then **ten thousand changes and myriad transformations (千变万化)** all arise from them.
Once **benevolence and righteousness (仁义)** are named,
then **ten thousand branches and myriad threads (千条万端)** all begin from them.
Thus, it is said: **"The named"** is the **mother of all things (万物之母)**.
**Mother** means **from this they are generated**.

The two phrases **"constant" and "non-constant"**—
this is where **Laozi** teaches people the **ultimate truth**.
In the **worldly realm (人世之间)**,
each thing is **non-constant (有)**,
yet who knows that this **non-constant** originates from **the constant**?
If one insists on **the constant** alone,
then **non-constant** will again arise—
the **reckless, chaotic acts (莽莽荡荡)** that invite **calamity and disaster (招殃祸)**.

Thus, those who study the **Dao/Way** must, in the **constant state (无时)***,
seek the **ultimate truth (无上究竟)** of the **constant**,
and see the **marvelousness (妙)** of how **non-constant** arises.
Or, in the **non-constant state (有时)***,
seek the **ultimate truth (有上究竟)** of the **non-constant**,
and see its **source (徼)** from **the constant**.

**"Source"** is what **The Book of Rites (礼记)*** calls
**the hidden depths of mountains and rivers (窍於山川之窍)***—
speaking of **its origin (所自出)**.

The two **"desire" (欲)** characters here have deep meaning.
**"Desire"** means **to seek earnestly**—
to seek earnestly this **ultimate truth**.
Though **constant** and **non-constant** appear as two,
though they bear different names,
their origin is the same.
If one can observe **constant** and **non-constant** with **the constant** in mind,
then both are called **Dao/Way**.

**"Dao/Way"** is the **marvelousness of transformation (造化之妙)***.
Observing it thus,
how could **Laozi’s teachings** be said to **exclusively uphold emptiness and nothingness (虚无)**?
If one **exclusively adheres to the constant**,
then one cannot acknowledge that both **constant** and **non-constant** share the same origin—
that is not called **"Dao/Way"** as **Dao/Way**.

**"Dao/Way beyond the Dao/Way"**—
the **gateway to all marvels**.
This is what **Zhuangzi (庄子)*** praises as:
**"What has a beginning"**—
**"what has no beginning yet has a beginning"**—
**"what has no beginning yet has no beginning"**—
but only **extols its marvelousness**, with no other meaning.
If one says **"there is another layer above this layer"**, then it is not his **original intent**.

**"All marvels"** are what **The Book of Changes (易)*** calls:
**"the marvelousness of all things"**.
**"Gateway"** refers to **its origin**.

Many people discuss this passage only in terms of **heaven and earth**,
yet they fail to grasp **Laozi’s true intent**—
to **examine it within the mind**.
Only by **viewing it together** can one attain the **full meaning of this book**.

**Fàn Yìngyuán (范应元)** said:
**"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of"**—
**not the constant Dao/Way**.

**Dao/Way** is the **principle of nature (自然之理)**,
the **origin of all things (万物之所由)**.
**What can be spoken of** means **what can be expressed in words**.
**"Constant"** means **enduring**.

**Dao/Way** is **one**,
yet it has **substance and function (体用)***.
No one has ever **known its function without first grasping its substance**.
**Substance** must be established first,
then **function** can be put into practice.

**Laozi’s** teaching begins by **clarifying its substance**—
**"constant"** refers to **its substance**,
**"what can be spoken of"** refers to **its function**.
**Substance and function** share a **single source**,
not two separate **Dao/Way**.

Now, **benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom**—
these are **what can be spoken of**,
all **functions of the Dao/Way**.

People merely know:
**the heart of compassion (恻隐之心)** as the **beginning of benevolence (仁之端)***,
**the heart of shame and dislike (羞恶之心)** as the **beginning of righteousness (义之端)***,
**the heart of decorum and yielding (辞让之心)** as the **beginning of propriety (礼之端)***,
**the heart of distinction and judgment (是非之心)** as the **beginning of wisdom (智之端)***,
yet they fail to recognize
that **the Dao/Way’s single substance (体之一)** is **the Dao/Way itself**.

**Divided and scattered** in four directions,
the **endless branches (末流)*** bring **no small harm (不胜其弊)***.

Only if one **first knows its single substance**,
then **daily life and constant practice** will naturally reveal itself in **each affair**,
without fail—
all **the principle of nature (自然之理)**.

Thus, it will endure **without harm** for long.
Therefore, whatever **Dao/Way** can be spoken of,
it is **not the constant, enduring, natural Dao/Way**.

The **constant, enduring, natural Dao/Way**—
**has form yet is formless (有形)***,
**is formless yet has essence (无形)***,
its **greatness knows no outer limit (大无外)**,
so it **embodies all without exclusion (无不包)**;
its **smallness knows no inner limit (小无内)**,
so it **penetrates all without omission (细无不入)**,
**all-pervasive (无不通)**.

Seeking it in **the initial state of my mind (吾心之初)***,
one will attain it.

**All people** are born from this,
**sages and worthies** stand by embodying this.
Yet though this **Dao/Way** **pervades all affairs (周行乎事物之际)***,
**is transmitted through scriptures (相传乎典籍之中)***,
its **marvelous depths**—
**affairs cannot mingle with them (事物莫能杂)***,
**words cannot reach them (言辩莫能及)***—
so few people **attain mastery (鲜造诣)***.

**Laozi** **responded to the times (应运)** and **delivered his teachings (垂教)***,
**revealing the Dao/Way out of necessity (不得已而发明)***,
how could it be **separated from words (离乎言)**?
Thus, he begins with:
**"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of"**—
**not the constant Dao/Way**,
intending to make people **know the constant, enduring, natural Dao/Way**,
**not in words (不在言哉)**,
but to **seek it within themselves (反求诸己)***,
and **attain it in the initial state of my mind (自得之於吾心之初)***.

**"The name that can be named"**—
**not the constant name**.

**Name** is like **a person’s given name**.
All **names that can be named** are **what can be spoken of**,
**not the constant, enduring, natural Dao/Way**.

「Moreover, take the case of all things: when they first arise, they do not yet have names—only the names given by past sages to distinguish them. All things with form can indeed be spoken of and named, but the constant, enduring, natural Dao/Way is the origin of all things, yet **without form (无形)**, so it cannot be spoken of or named.

**"The Unnamed (无名)"** is the beginning of heaven and earth.
Before heaven and earth existed, this Dao/Way was already present, **indistinct and undifferentiated (浑沦未判)**, who could name it?
**"The Named (有名)"** is the mother of all things.
Once **indistinct and undifferentiated (浑沦)** was clarified, heaven, earth, and all beings came into existence. The sage saw that this was the mother of all things yet **without form (无形)**, so he **forced a term upon it (强字)**, calling it Dao/Way, and **assigned a name to it (强为之名)**, calling it *Great (大)*. Because it was originally unnamed yet forced to be named, he did so that all people might **borrow this name (假此有名)** and **investigate its unnameable essence (探其无名)**, thereby **restoring its original state (以复其初)**.

Thus, **one must habitually lack desire (常无欲)** to perceive its subtlety (妙).
**"Habitually lacking desire (常无欲)"**—**habitually without fixed speech (常无绝句)**, observing the *departing voice (去声)*, scrutinizing it closely (谛视).
**"Subtlety (妙)"**—**the ultimate subtlety (徼妙)**, the constant, enduring, natural Dao/Way.
From ancient times, it has always existed, yet **without form or sound (无形无声)**, so **exquisitely subtle (微妙)** that it cannot be fully exhausted. Hence, it is called *constant unnameable (常无)*, intending to **urge people to observe its subtlety (以观其微妙)**.

Only humans, born from this Dao/Way, are the most **responsive (灵)** of all things. If they truly **retrace the light and reflect inward (回光反视)** within themselves, **awakening to the single true essence (悟一真体)**, though it be **utterly void (至虚)**, yet **nothing is lacking (物无不备)**, then the Dao’s subtlety can be **perceived and observed (可得而观)**.

Thus, one comes to know that **one principle encompasses all particulars (一理包乎万殊)**, and all things and affairs **cannot defy (不可违)** the natural principle.

**One must habitually have desire (常有欲)** to perceive its **manifestation (徼)**.
**"Habitually having desire (常有欲)"**—**habitually with fixed speech (常有绝句)**, observing the *level voice (平声)*, **manifestation (徼)**, which is **to follow (循)**, **the realm (境)**, **or return (归)**.
The Great Dao/Way is natural and spontaneous, transforming and giving rise to all things. In heaven, it manifests as the forms of sun, moon, stars, and galaxies (星汉); on earth, as mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees; in humans, as the substance of **body, hair, and skin (身体发肤)**. Hence, it is called *constant having (常有)*, intending to **urge people to observe its manifestations (以观其境)**.

Only humans, **standing between heaven and earth (中天地)** as one of the *Three Powers (三才)*, if they **contemplate above and examine below (仰观俯察)** within the *Two Principles (两仪)*, realize that though all things have different forms, the principle is **never absent (无不在)**. Then, the Dao’s **manifestations and subtleties (境致)** can be **perceived and observed (可得而观)**.

Thus, one comes to know that **all particulars return to one principle (万殊归於一理)**, and all things and affairs **must follow (固当)** the natural principle.

These two—**constant unnameable (常无)** and **constant having (常有)**—are called *Dao (道)*.
*"Dao (道)"* refers to **that which is profound and distant (深远)**, yet **cannot be distinguished (不可分别)**.
It is **neither non-existence (无)** without the ability to reveal existence (有),
nor existence (有)** without the ability to reveal non-existence (无)**.
Existence and non-existence **emerge together yet bear different names (同出而异名)**.

If one considers the Dao/Way as **non-existence (无)**, then all transformations arise from it.
If one considers the Dao/Way as **existence (有)**, then it is **formless and soundless (无形无声)**, ever **unchanging (常常不变)**.
Hence, it is said: **constant unnameable, constant having (常无常有)**.

Above the **non-existent and existent (无有)**, both are **marked with the character *constant (常)***, pointing to its **root (本)**.
Since it is **neither existent nor non-existent (无有不二)**, yet **profound and distant (深远)**, it is exhaustively called *Dao (道)*.

I have often thought that **existence and non-existence (有无)** alone are **insufficient to discuss the Dao/Way (论道)**.
Yet, from its **subtlety (微妙)**, one cannot avoid calling it *constant unnameable (常无)*;
from its **manifestation (着见)**, one cannot avoid calling it *constant having (常有)*.

When **divided (分而言之)**, subtlety is **refined (微)**, manifestation is **explicit (显)**;
when **unified (合而言之)**, non-existence and existence **emerge together yet bear different names (同出而异名)**,
and both **refined and explicit (妙徼)** are **one Dao/Way (一道)**.
This is how **Laozi** **combines non-existence and existence (兼有无)**, **penetrates explicit and refined (贯显微)**, **unifies same and different (合同异)** in his discourse.

If people can **observe in this manner (如是观之)**, then **refined and explicit (妙与徼)** will **communicate (相通)**, and **things and self (物与我)** will **merge indistinctly (浑融)**.
Inside and outside will be **clearly revealed (表里洞然)**,
with **no obstruction to its root (本无留碍)** nor **any distinction (无差别)**.

*"Dao that is again Dao (玄之又玄)"*—
the **gateway to all subtleties (众妙之门)**.
The constant, enduring, natural Dao/Way **cannot be fully expressed by names or words (不可以名言)**.
Now, since it is **forced to be termed (强字)** as Dao/Way,
and from its **subtlety (微妙)**, it is called *constant unnameable (常无)*,
and from its **manifestation (着见)**, it is called *constant having (常有)*.
Again, from its **root’s unity of existence and non-existence (本之有无不二)**,
profound and distant, yet **inexhaustible (难穷)**, it is **equally called *Dao (玄)***.
All these are **inevitably bound by words (不免乎言焉)**.

*"Dao that is again Dao (玄之又玄)"*—
this is **like saying *profound that is again profound (深之又深)*, distant that is again distant (远之又远)***.
It is **neither non-existence nor existence (非无非有)**,
**neither different nor the same (非异非同)**,
**unknown in its *so-and-so-yet-so (所以然)***,
yet **cannot be fully named or spoken of (终不可得而名言)**,
for it is **beyond distinction (分别)**.

Yet, all transformations arise from it, each **possessing its own subtlety (各各具妙)**,
hence it is called **the gateway to all subtleties (众妙之门)**.

Laozi **pities (悯)** that **people of the world chase superficiality (逐末)** while **forgetting the root (忘本)**,
and **lose the true source (失真源)**.
Unable to help but **respond to the times (应运)** and **deliver his teachings (垂训)**,
he also **fears that people will drown in words (溺於言辞)**,
and **cannot reflect inward (弗能内观)**.
Thus, he **further instructs (示人以深意)**,
**compelling them to seek within themselves (必使反求诸己)**,
**desiring they attain it themselves (欲其自得之)**,
and **enter the gateway to all subtleties (以入众妙之门)**,
**restoring its original state (以复其初)**.
They can also **embody and act upon it (体是而行)**,
**assisting the natural transformation of all things (以辅万物之自然)**,
and **returning to unity (而同归于一)**.

Only humans are the most **responsive (灵)** of all things.
If they truly **reflect inward (反观)**, this Dao/Way **will remain luminously present (湛然常存)**—
how could it be **distant (远)**?

This chapter **directly points to the initial state of this mind (直指此心之初)**,
the natural principle,
**preventing confusion over existence and non-existence, same and different (不惑於有无同异)**,
**realizing the intent beyond words (得意忘言)**,
**ascending to the profound and attaining subtlety (升玄及妙)**,
and **entering the Dao’s gateway (乃入道之门)**.

**Establishing the foundation of virtue (立德之基)**,
this is **the essence of the entire teaching (实一经之总)**.
It should be **deeply savored (宜深味之)**.

Xu Jun Yue said:
*"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is the gateway to the Dao/Way."*
The first four sentences state that the Dao/Way **cannot be conveyed through speech (不可以言语道说)**,
nor **labeled with names (不可以名字题号)**.

Yet, **ancient sages who understood the Dao/Way (古之知道者)**,
**wishing to guide people through words (欲因言语以示人)**,
**could not help but assign names to it (则不得不立为名字)**,
though these were **not its originally inherent nature (非其本来固有)**.

Hence, the next four sentences **follow the previous (承上而言)**:
*"The Unnamed (无)"* is what names **the beginning of heaven and earth (天地之始)**,
*"The Named (有)"* is what names **the mother of all things (万物之母)**.
**"The beginning (始)"** refers to **the Dao/Way beyond form (形而上之道)** before heaven and earth existed.
The Dao/Way **cannot be called non-existence (无)**, yet it is **formless, soundless, and without attributes (无声臭无形状)**—
only **forced to be named (借此而强名之耳)**.

Now that the Dao/Way has been named, how can it also be called "the Nameless" as the mother of all things?

This refers to the period **after** heaven and earth came into being—speaking of the **manifested forms** beneath the Dao/Way. The Dao/Way does not arise only at this stage. Yet once it **adheres to these forms**, it takes on **concrete traces** and a **fixed position**, standing in contrast to the Nameless when spoken of.

If one points to this as "the Named," what then is the "Nameless"? To sever the discussion with the terms "Named" and "Nameless" alone is to disrupt the logic.

The next four sentences then speak of those who embody the Dao/Way and turn inward to examine themselves. They first use the term *"without desire"* to express it—those who are perpetually without desire are **pure in Dao/Way and nature**, born in stillness. Here, one observes its **subtlety**.

*"Subtlety"* means **so refined as to be invisible**, yet when one speaks of observing it, it must be **manifest yet not obscure**, revealing what others do not know.

Those who truly understand it **always have desire**, for this is the human heart responding to external stimuli.

From birth, humans are endowed with form, and the desires of the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, and limbs all have their objects—yet they cannot be entirely absent. Here, one observes its **boundaries**.

*"Boundaries"* means **to follow through**, or the **extreme limits** of the heart’s desires, tracing where they lead without falling into ruin.

Thus, the Dao/Way and its manifestations are inseparable—what distinguishes humans from other beings.

In the realm of heaven and earth, it is called **"the Nameless"** and **"the Named."**
In the human body, it is called **"without desire"** and **"with desire."**
If one rigidly separates the terms "Named" and "Nameless," the meaning still falls short.

These two aspects, though differently named, share the same origin and are both called **"the Mysterious."**
Though their names differ, their source is one.

*"The Mysterious"* carries the meaning of **profound and distant**, and when it is said *"the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious,"* it is the **portal to all subtleties**—if one says this is the Dao/Way, it is **empty and boundless**, the most profound and distant, yet the source of all movement, stillness, yin, yang, and the transformations of all things.

When Laozi speaks of the Dao/Way, he precedes this chapter and nowhere is it more crucial than here. Yet when our sages speak of the Dao/Way, they say it is **"without sound, without scent, without form,"** yet they do not call it simply **"non-existence."**
If one follows the next chapter—*"There is something formless and complete"*—how could it be said the Dao/Way is merely non-existence?

The terms "Named" and "Nameless" do not contradict each other. Those who understand the Dao/Way **silently recognize it**, and only then do they grasp the meaning of **"the Boundless"** and **"the Supreme Polarity,"** a truth that will never confuse the ages to come.

Xue Yongzhai says:
*"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the Eternal Dao/Way.
Silent and unmoving, this is the Eternal Dao/Way.
Responding and thus harmonizing, this is the Dao/Way that can be spoken of.
Before joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise, this is the Middle—**the Eternal Dao/Way**.
When they arise yet remain measured, this is Harmony—**the Dao/Way that can be spoken of**.
The Eternal Dao/Way is its **essence**; the Dao/Way that can be spoken of is its **function**.
From sincerity comes clarity—**applying essence to function**.
From clarity comes sincerity—**applying function to essence**."*

Wen Xuanxian says:
*"To read Laozi without understanding essence and function is to make entry difficult.
The Name that can be named is not the Eternal Name.
The Nameless Name is the Eternal Name.
The Named Name is the Name that can be named.
The Nameless is the mother of all things.
The Dao/Way originally had no name; it lost heaven and earth, hence 'the beginning.'
The Dao/Way, once named, gives birth to all things, hence 'the mother.'
The Eternal 'without desire' leads to observing its subtlety.
The Nameless and Named speak of the Dao/Way;
The without desire and with desire speak of humanity.
Observing subtlety while without desire is to observe its essence in stillness.
Observing boundaries while with desire is to observe its function in action.
To fail to know essence and function is to grasp only one side—either subtlety or boundaries.
These two aspects, when seen as identical, are called 'the Mysterious.'
When viewed from their differences, they are like the liver and gallbladder, Chu and Yue.
When viewed from their unity, all things are one.
If difference and unity align, and subtlety and boundaries are both forgotten, this can be called 'the Mysterious.'
'The Mysterious' is the fundamental principle of the Dao/Way.
'The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious' is the gateway to all subtleties.
The Mysterious is difficult to know; even when known, it still depends on something, hence 'beyond the Mysterious' is discarded.
If one attains 'the Mysterious yet not the Mysterious,' subject and object merge, and the Great Harmony of all transformations emerges from this."*

Xiu Xiu An says:
*"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the Eternal Name.
Empty yet luminous, tranquil yet profound—without form, without name, yet alive—this is called **True Emptiness**.
Existing yet without form—this is called **Wondrous Being**.
True Emptiness and Wondrous Being are boundlessly wondrous and profound.
Those who attain the utmost honor it as the Dao/Way.
The Dao/Way originally has no words; through words, it is revealed—this can be spoken of, yet it is not the common Dao/Way. It is the **Wondrous Dao/Way**, the **Great Dao/Way**.

*'Wondrous'* means **encompassing all without exclusion**, penetrating all without omission, acting without action yet universally responsive, without selfishness or origin, yet endlessly wondrous and inexhaustible—without form yet manifesting all forms, without name yet establishing all names.

*'Great'* means **without limit, without surpassing**, the most exalted and noble—it is the mother of **One Qi** and the ancestor of the **Three Powers**.
Thus, it is **Nameless**.
It is empty and luminous, without form—thus, it is **Nameless**.
When One Qi moves, clarity and turbidity separate; when the Two Principles are positioned, yin and yang become evident; when the Three Powers are established, all things are born—now it can be named.
The Dao/Way that can be named is the **Wondrous Dao/Way**, the **Great Dao/Way**, the **Great Root** of the Three Powers.

What is the **Great Root**?
The **clear and wondrous qi** is firm—above, it forms the image of **Heaven**.
The **wondrous yet turbid qi** is yielding—below, it takes form as **Earth**.
Those who receive the **pure, true, and harmonious qi of luminous clarity** are **humanity**, where firmness and yielding balance.
Empty, luminous, and wondrous, in humans it is called **the Heart**, the sovereign of the body, the king of all things—also called **Nature**, which is **Life**.
'Nature' is what is called **Heaven’s Command**.
The Nameless is the mother of all things.
Without form yet supremely empty and luminous, alive yet without sound or color—
within it, One Qi emerges—this is called **the Primordial Origin of Heaven and Earth**.
From this, the Three Powers are established, and the Three Generations give birth to all things—
thus it is named, the **mother of all things**, and the world is complete."*

「Though all things differ in form, they all receive the same **Heaven’s Grace** in their origin.

The **Dao/Way** is without action, yet its **virtue/power** shines forth.
The **Dao/Way** is the **substance**; **virtue/power** is its **function**.
Without **substance**, **function** cannot arise;
without **function**, **substance** lacks **wondrous efficacy**.
To act without action yet possess **wondrous efficacy**—this is the **Dao/Way**.

The **Primordial Origin of Heaven and Earth** is the **Gate of the Nameless**.

The **Laozi** taught that even self-benefit is universal benefit for all beings,
saying: *"Always abandon all causes and conditions,
and let no thought arise—
cutting off all desires to perceive its **wondrous efficacy**.*
From **wondrous efficacy** to **the Mysterious**,
one attains the **unobstructed Dao/Way**."

The **Confucian** school calls the **Dao/Way** the **Great Origin**,
and its essence, *"**joy, anger, sorrow, and delight** yet unmanifested,"* is called **the Middle**.
The character **中 (Middle)** is but a symbol to convey this **Dao/Way**.
It cannot be understood by mere linguistic reasoning—
like pointing at the moon with a finger.

When the first thought has yet to sprout,
one must fix the gaze to suddenly awaken and comprehend.

The **Buddhist** school calls the **Dao/Way** the **Real Suchness**,
the **True Thusness**,
the **Thusness of the Tathāgata**,
and the **Dharma of Non-Birth**,
and its essence, *"**not thinking of good, not thinking of evil**,
returning the light to self-examine—
suddenly awakening to clarity."*
The principles of the **Three Teachings** converge in the **Dao/Way**.

Those who observe **wondrous efficacy** with **desire**—
at the moment when thought arises and the **mechanism** is about to unfold—
within perception, hearing, awareness, and action,
when **dynamic** and **static** interplay,
one may return to perceive the **spontaneous transformation** and thus awaken and comprehend.

**"Always without desire"** means **"without thought"**—entering through **principle**;
**"always with desire"** means **"with thought"**—entering through **affairs**.
Both **"with thought"** and **"without thought"** emerge from the **Heart**,
yet their names differ.

Both are called **the Mysterious**.
The **True Heart** is formless—
to gaze upon it, one sees nothing;
to listen to it, one hears no sound.
**The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious**—
utterly empty and luminous, beyond all **intellect** and **discernment**,
cutting off all **conceptualization** and **reasoning**, with no analogy—
**True Void, Wondrous Existence**,
where **yin** and **yang** reveal their **wondrous efficacy**,
and the **Three Powers** are established,
while all things are born.
The **Three Bonds** and **Five Constants**,
legal codes and governance,
the language of civilization,
artisan skills and crafts,
means of livelihood,
all virtues and conducts,
transcendent scriptures,
supernatural powers and **spiritual penetrations**,
radiant longevity and **life-force**,
**wisdom** and eloquence,
**wondrous mechanisms** and **functions**,
pure and luminous worlds,
and turbid and evil worlds—
all arise from this.

Thus it is called the **Gate of All Wonders**.

Zhū Bófǔxiù said:
*"The **Gate of the Dao/Way**—the **Primordial Origin**."*

The **Dao/Way** itself is **Primordial** and **Nameless**,
not to be spoken of.
What may be spoken of is but its **manifestation in the world**.
The **Dao/Way** itself is **Ultimate** and **Silent**,
beyond all naming.
What may be named is but forced words.

Humans are not born with innate knowledge—
**principle** must be conveyed through words and teachings.
Through **manifestation**, one perceives the **Heart**,
and through **convenient expedients**, one reveals the **Real**.
Thus, one advances along the **Dao/Way** and returns to its **constancy**,
ascending to **wondrous efficacy**.

The **Dao/Way** resides within all things,
intermingling without separation—
this is **the constant Dao/Way**.
The **Dao/Way** disperses as all things,
and through discriminating all things, names are established—
this is **the Dao/Way of differentiation**.

Is **the constant Dao/Way** like the sun’s brilliance at midday?
The daylight arises naturally and is boundless.

Or is it like the candle’s radiance?
The nightlight is created by humans and is limited.

Similarly, what may be spoken of or named—
its meaning is the same.

The world calls that which does not change **"the constant"**,
yet it does not know that **the ability to change** is also its **constancy**.

There is no **constancy** without change,
and no change without **constancy**.

Pushing this reasoning to its utmost:
**"Great Constancy"** is **Nameless**—
the **constancy of the Dao/Way**, the **constancy of names**,
not entangled in **form** or **qi**.
When emptiness reaches its extreme, **spiritual vitality** is born—
this is the **beginning of Heaven and Earth**.

With **name**, it may be spoken of and named—
when **principles** first emerge and **qi** reveals its **manifestations**,
this is the **origin of all things**.

The **beginning of Heaven and Earth** is the **Dao/Way**,
and the **origin of all things** is **Heaven and Earth** itself.

If humans can return to perceive within their own bodies
the **beginning of Heaven and Earth**,
and grasp the **principle of birth and transformation**—
when all illusions are extinguished,
the **True Constancy** remains—
then both **"with desire"** and **"without desire"** do not depart from the **Dao/Way**.

**"With desire"** refers to the initial sprout of a good thought,
the origin of all **affairs** and **principles**.
**"Without desire"** is when the **True Nature** is serene and undisturbed,
**Heaven’s Principle** surges through unobstructed,
not a speck of dust stands—
**ghosts and spirits** cannot even pry into it.

The **Dao/Way’s** most refined subtleties—
what else is there to observe?

**"Manifestation"** is like an **edge or boundary**,
pointing to the **initial state of the Heart**,
when it is about to interact with all things.
One must then return to perceive it
to **block its source**—
even good thoughts should not be indulged,
much less those that are not good.

**"Without desire"** is **silent** and unmoving,
**"with desire"** is responsive and thus harmonized.
**Substance** and **function** share one source,
and the **mechanism** lies in **dynamic** and **static** interplay.

The **degree** of **dynamic** and **static**—
this distinguishes **commoners** from **sages**.

**"Wondrous efficacy"** is the **essence of the Dao/Way**,
**"manifestation"** is the **initial state of all things**—
the **resources** for **birth and transformation** never stray from daily life.
**"Wondrous efficacy"** is not **utterly absent** yet **vast and empty**;
from **emptiness**, **qi** is transformed—
when there is yet **no form**, it is already present.

**"Manifestation"** is not **concrete and pervasive**;
from **stillness**, it moves—
even the slightest **impulse** can be measured.
To delve deeply into this **principle**,
one perceives as if **void** yet suddenly sees a **crow soaring**,
or **water still** yet suddenly hears a **fish leaping**—
suddenly awakening to profound insight,
one opens the **Heaven of the Heart**—
the **crow** flies beyond, the **fish** leaps away—
what is seen or heard?

Though **traces** and **sounds** may vanish,
the **perceiver** of seeing and hearing never truly vanishes.
This is the **secret transmission of the Heart-Seal** from my **Primordial Ancestor of the Supreme Ultimate and Mixed Element**.

If humans maintain **the constant Heart**,
initially observing all worldly thoughts without interruption,
they may enter the realm of **"beyond manifestation"** and return purely to **"wondrous efficacy"**,
then what is called **"desire"** is but **tortoise hair** and **rabbit horn**.

**"Manifestation"** and **"wondrous efficacy"** both emerge from the **Dao/Way**,
yet **principles** have degrees of refinement—
like a **spring** issuing from the mountains,
nourishing and irrigating all—
its benefits are countless.
Clear and pure, its **True Nature** remains.
Though **wind** and **sun** may wither it,
it relies on the **inexhaustible source**.
Always observing these two paths,
the **source** may be restored.

**"The Mysterious"** is the **ultimate principle of the Dao/Way**,
profound and subtle, refined and **manifested**.

If one holds this **perception**,
one is still bound by **dharma**.
Even **dharma** must be abandoned,
to truly grasp the **principles of the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious**.

All arise from this—
thus it is called the **Gate**.

This **Gate** has no barriers or locks,
only those who understand the **Dao/Way** may enter.

Though **wonders** are manifold,
they all emerge from **the Mysterious**—
thus **all wonders are one wonder**,
and **one wonder encompasses all wonders**.

Those who **create the Mysterious** know this.»

「The *Cow Miao* transmission states:
The **Dao/Way**, though it may be spoken of, is beyond naming as **the Unnameable**.

The **Dao/Way** is that which, when observed, is unseen,
when listened to, is unheard—
**the void** yet **naturally** existing.

Before the **Five Great**,
before **Hongmeng** (the primordial chaos) emerged,
only **Mingdang** (the boundless void) and **Daofan** (the great primal),
**vast and luminousless**,
**unfathomable**—
this is what is called **Taiyi** (the Supreme Unity).

**Taiyi** refers to **the state before qi** existed.
Gradually, it is called **Taichu** (the Primordial Origin).
**Taichu** refers to the **first stirrings of qi**.

Gradually, it is called **Taishi** (the Primordial Beginning).
**Taishi** refers to **qi** existing yet **unformed** in substance.

Gradually, it is called **Taixu** (the Primordial Purity).
**Taixu** refers to **substance** existing yet **unshaped** in form.

Gradually, it is called **Taiji** (the Primordial Polarity).
**Taiji** refers to **form and substance** already complete.

Once polarity is complete, it divides—
**light and clear qi** ascends to become **Heaven**,
**heavy and turbid qi** condenses below to become **Earth**,
**harmonious central qi** becomes **Humanity**,
and the **remaining essence** disperses,
giving rise to **all things**.

Its **divine functions and wondrous operations** are **boundless and vast**,
**inexhaustible**—
**no measure or limit**.

The **Supreme Sage** expounds the scriptures,
**speaking without words**,
thus forcibly naming it the **Dao/Way**.

The **Dao/Way**, though possessing **emotion** and **nature**,
**lacks thought** and **action**—
**transmissible yet unreceived**,
**obtainable yet invisible**,
**self-originating and self-rooted**,
existing **before Heaven and Earth**,
**since ancient times** unchanging.

**Gods and spirits, divine emperors**—
those who **generate Heaven and Earth**,
exist **before Taiji** yet are **not exalted**;
they exist **beneath the Six Extremes** yet are **not profound**.
Yet in their **operations**,
**greatly** receiving it yields **greatness**,
**slightly** receiving it yields **smallness**—
when spoken of in **proximity**,
it **pervades autumnal hairs** with abundance;
when spoken of in **distance**,
it **encompasses the great void** yet is **insufficient**.

It is **the sound of sound**,
**the echo of echoes**,
**the form of forms**,
**the shadow of shadows**—
the **square** receives it and becomes **still**,
the **round** receives it and becomes **active**.
**Without bias**, yet **omnipresent**,
**without constraint**, yet **unrestricted**—
thus it is called **the Speakable**.

The **Unnameable** is **the Nonexistent**.
The **Constant** is **the Unchanging**.

The **Dao/Way’s operations** are **multifarious and adaptive**,
**without fixed constancy**—
in **Heaven**, it is **Heaven**,
in **Earth**, it is **Earth**,
in the **Four Seasons**, it is the **Four Seasons**,
in the **Four Great Elements**, it is **Fire, Wind, Earth, Water**,
in the **Five Phases**, it is **Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth**,
in the **Five Constants**, it is **Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, Wisdom, Trust**,
in **celestial phenomena**, it is the **Sun, Moon, Stars, and Constellations**,
in **terrestrial geography**, it is the **Mountains, Rivers, and Seas**,
in the **day**, it is **day and night, obscurity and clarity**,
in **humanity**, it is **seeing, hearing, speaking, and acting**,
in **all things**, it is **flourishing and withering, decay and growth**,
in **one breath of qi**, it is **movement and stillness, hardness and softness**.
Names are **innumerable**—
most are **emanations of the Dao/Way**,
**without fixed designation**,
thus it is called **the Unnameable**.

**The Unnameable** is the **beginning of Heaven and Earth**.
**The Nonexistent** is the **substance of the Dao/Way**.

The **Dao/Way’s substance** emerges **before Taiyi**,
**hidden within the void**,
**without light or image**,
**without color or name**,
**without form or trace**,
**without tone or sound**—
before **Minghuang** (the indistinct) and **Taipu** (the undifferentiated) arose,
before **the great simplicity** became **mixed**,
it is but **silent and desolate**,
**only hazy and indistinct**.

Thus the scriptures say:
*"Observed, it is unseen;
listened to, it is unheard."*

If it is **unseen and unheard** by **sight and sound**,
then what else is it but **the Nonexistent**?»

「The Venerable Lord Lao said: The **Dao/Way’s** manifestation is **formless and subtle**,
**hazy and indistinct yet somehow present**.

Like planting a tree,
when it has not yet sprouted, one does not see branches, leaves, or roots—
these are all examples of **the Nonexistent**.

**The Beginning** is also the **Dao/Way**.
In the time of **Taiyi** and **Tai Shi** (the Great Beginning),
**Heaven and Earth** lacked roots,
**the sun and moon** lacked light,
**dark and obscure**, **without origin or lineage**,
the **Three Colors** (三色 *sān sè*) in **chaotic mixture**,
now appearing, now vanishing—
until the **cosmic cycles** (*yùn tuī shù jí*) reached their utmost,
when the **Three Qi** (三气 *sān qì*) illuminated,
**clear and high**,
**accumulated yang** formed **Heaven**,
**congealed and settled qi** formed **Earth**,
the **Nine Qi** aligned in order,
**the sun, moon, and stars**,
**yin and yang, the Five Phases**,
**people and things**—
all received their birth and formation,
thus the common saying that **Heaven and Earth’s beginning** is **the Dao/Way**,
originating from this very explanation.

**The Named** is the **mother of all things**.
**The Existent** is the **function/operation** of the **Dao/Way**.

For the **Dao/Way’s function/operation** arises from **the Nonexistent**.
The **Nonexistent** is **the Nonexistent**,
but from **the Nonexistent** must come **the Existent**—
**Tai Ji** (the Supreme Polarity) is this.

**Tai Ji** divides,
and then **Heaven and Earth** exist;
**Heaven and Earth** exist,
and then **all things** exist;
**All things** exist,
and then **male and female** exist;
**Male and female** exist,
and then **husband and wife** exist;
**Husband and wife** exist,
and then **lords and ministers** exist;
**Lords and ministers** exist,
and then **high and low** exist—
all derive from **the Nonexistent** before they come into being.
If they derive from **the Nonexistent** before they come into being,
what else is it but **the Dao/Way**?
Thus it is said that **the Existent** is the **function/operation** of the **Dao/Way**.

**Mother** is the **Dao/Way**—
how so?

*The **Yijing System** says:
*"All things under Heaven and Earth are full of it."*

Take, for instance, the **roots and stems** that grow and **branches and leaves** that flourish,
**buds that sprout** and **ears that bear fruit**,
**wings that fly** and **feet that walk**,
**scales that leap** and **beaks that peck and cry**,
**breath that nourishes** and **teeth that bite**—
in **thousands of forms and ten thousand states**,
all arise from **the Dao/Way**.

The common saying goes:
*"That which gives birth to me is my parents."*
Now, since it is said that **the Dao/Way** is the **mother of all things**,
what else could it be but **the Dao/Way**?

*The **Scripture of Inner Observation** says:
*"The Nonexistent is the mother of the Existent,
the Nonexistent is the mother of the Void,
the Void is the mother of the Dao/Way.
The Dao/Way is the mother of all things."*

Thus, **the Dao/Way** is **the mother of all things**—
is this not so?

**The Way’s substance** is **always the Nonexistent** to observe its **miraculous subtlety**.
**The Always-Nonexistent** is the **Dao/Way’s substance**.

For the **Great Dao’s substance** is always in **the Nonexistent**,
when in **utterly chaotic void**,
above, there is **no high Heaven**,
no **sun and moon**,
no **stars, clouds, or mists**,
no **dew, thunder, or lightning**,
no **wind or rain**,
no **frost or snow**—
only **dim and boundless**,
**dark and obscure**.

Below, there is **no thick Earth**,
no **mountains or rivers**,
no **lakes or seas**,
no **streams or valleys**,
no **grasses or trees**,
no **beasts or birds**,
no **people or nations**—
only **silent and murky**,
**deep and indistinct**.

Thus, the **Great Dao’s substance** is **always the Nonexistent**,
and this is why it is said.

**Miraculous subtlety** is the **Dao/Way’s substance**—
this is the explanation given earlier.

**The Always-Nonexistent** means **its still and unmoving nature**.
Yet its **still and unmoving substance** is **profound and unfathomable**,
**concealed and difficult to perceive**—
this is why it is called **the Always-Nonexistent**.

But this principle is **inherent in all people**,
only when **delusive thoughts are suddenly eradicated**,
and one **sits in silent repose**,
the **mind like the Great Void**,
**without the slightest obstruction**—
at this moment,
**the Dao/Way is I**,
**I am the Dao/Way**.
Is this not **miraculous subtlety**?

To observe it means **to probe its concealed depths**.

**The Existent** is **always present** to observe its **boundless operation**.
**The Always-Existent** is the **function/operation** of the **Dao/Way**—
it refers to the **mixed and divided**,
**Heaven and Earth** taking form,
the **Three Lights** (*Sān Guāng*) arrayed in the **upper vault**,
the **Five Venerable Stars** (*Wǔ Wéi*) traversing their **degrees**,
**yin and yang** ascending and descending,
**cold and heat** passing in turn,
**rain and dew** nourishing,
**wind and thunder** commanding—
the **Five Phases** generating and overcoming,
the **Four Seasons** shifting in succession—
even the **Nine Regions and Eight Directions**,
the **Five Lakes and Four Seas**,
**kings, lords, and vassals**,
**villages and communities**,
**grasses, trees, mountains, and rivers**,
**all classes and myriad things**—
**constantly filling Heaven and Earth**,
all arising from the **Dao/Way’s qi** flowing ceaselessly,
thus it is said that **the Always-Existent** is the **function/operation** of the **Dao/Way**.

**Boundless operation** is the **function/operation** of the **Dao/Way**—
this is the explanation given earlier.

Then what is **the Always-Existent**?
Like **Heaven’s longevity and Earth’s duration**,
the **Four Seasons** proceeding,
**hundreds of things** flourishing—
**never once failing to fulfill its appointed time**,
thus it is called **the Always-Existent**.

Moreover, the **human body** is called **a lesser Heaven and Earth**,
the **head round** like **Heaven**,
the **feet square** like **Earth**,
the **eyes** named **sun and moon**,
the **hair** as **stars and constellations**,
the **Four Seasons and Five Phases**,
**yin and yang** ascending and descending,
**plants and forests**—
all things are complete.
If one can observe **the Dao/Way’s substance and function** and act accordingly,
then **this body is the Dao/Way**,
**the Dao/Way is this body**.

This is the **uttermost profundity of the two** (*liǎng zhě*).
The **two**—meaning **boundless operation and miraculous subtlety**—
both flow from the **same single Dao/Way**,
thus distinct names are established to **illustrate its substance and function**,
and it is said that **they are both called the Profound**.

Yet **the Dao/Way’s substance**, though **dim and obscure without form**,
must necessarily have **function/operation**—
**the Nonexistent** is its **substance**,
**Tai Ji** is its **function/operation**.

**Substance** is **stillness**,
**function/operation** is **movement**—
how so?

**Meng Han** said:
*"From the Nonexistent comes Tai Ji,
Tai Ji moves and generates yang,
movement reaches its limit and becomes still,
stillness and it generates yin,
stillness reaches its limit and moves again,
movement reaches its limit and becomes still again—
each movement and each stillness
mutually serve as their roots.
Together, they are called the Dao/Way."*
Thus it is said that **they are both called the Profound**.

The **gateway to the Profound**—
this is the **Supreme Lord’s** praise of the **Dao/Way**.

**The Profound** refers to **the Dao/Way** as an entity,
**so subtle and miraculous it defies thought**,
the **mind is confounded** and cannot know it,
the **mouth is stilled** and cannot speak of it—
exhausting the **waters of the Western River** would not suffice to write its **virtue/power**,
and **all mouths in the universe** would not suffice to articulate its **profound subtlety**.

**Difficult to discuss and difficult to think**,
**utterly profound and utterly miraculous**—
in a single word,
thus it is called **the Profound of the Profound** (*xuán zhī yòu xuán*).」

「All the myriad wonders—
these are the **ten thousand things** (*wànwù*); the **gateway**—
this is **principle** (*lǐ*).

**Principle** is the **Dao/Way**.

Now, between heaven and earth,
every single thing has its **principle**,
every single **principle** has its **gateway**,
and the **gateway** is the **portal** for entry and exit.

Confucius said:
*"Who can exit without passing through the door?"*
Thus, **what could be more fitting than this Dao/Way**?

The world speaks of **eighty-four thousand gateways** (*bā wàn sì qiān mén*),
each with its own **principle**,
yet this single **gateway** alone
encompasses all **principles**,
nothing is omitted—
thus it is called the **gateway to all wonders**.

Yang Zhìrén said:
*"This is the **gateway to the Profound of the Dao/Way**."*

The **Dao/Way** is originally nameless,
beginning before heaven and earth yet not being their **origin**,
ending after heaven and earth yet not being their **termination**.
If it can be named, then it is not the **Dao/Way**.

The **constant Dao/Way**—
daily life and habitual practice are all the **Dao/Way**,
drinking and eating, clothing and shelter,
sleeping, medicine, and all else—
these are all the **Dao/Way**.

**Names**—
heaven and earth were not originally without names to be called.
The ancients said:
*"If you name it, it is no longer the **Dao/Way**;
if it can be named, then it is not the **Dao/Way** itself."*

**Names**—
such as **heaven and earth**,
**sun and moon**,
**yin and yang**,
**ten thousand things**,
**human**,
**spirit**—
these are all called **common names**.

The **Dao/Way** without name at the **beginning** of heaven and earth—
this is the **Non-Extreme** (*Wújí*).
The **Non-Extreme** moves and gives rise to **yang**,
is still and gives rise to **yin**,
thus it is called the **Non-Extreme**,
thus it is called the **beginning**.

The **Extreme**—
this is the **Supreme Lord** (*Tàijí*).
Its **forms and manifestations** are fully visible;
this is the **Supreme Lord** dividing into **one**,
**one** generating **two**,
**two** generating **three**,
and **three** generating the **ten thousand things**.

Heaven, without **desire** (*yù*), has the **Four Qi** (*sìqì*) clear and bright,
Humans, without **desire**, are serene and ever at peace—
this is the **miracle of returning light** (*fǎn guāng fǎn zhào*) to observe.

If humans have **desire**,
then in their **interactions with circumstances** and **engagements with things**,
they must never forget the **returning light** to illuminate—
these two are **same in origin yet different in name**.

Thus it is said:
*"Within the arising of movement and stillness,*
the **profound subtlety** is fully manifested here."

Zhuangzi said:
*"The **Dao/Way**—
it has **sentience** and **character**,
yet does nothing and takes no form.
It can be **transmitted** yet cannot be **received**,
can be **obtained** yet cannot be **seen**.
From its **root and origin**,
before heaven and earth existed,
since ancient times it has always been so.

**Spirits and deities**, **divine lords and sovereigns**,
give birth to heaven and earth,
existing before the **Supreme Lord** yet not being **high**,
existing beneath the **Six Extremes** yet not being **deep**.

Existing before heaven and earth yet not being **eternal**,
enduring beyond the **upper antiquity** yet not being **ancient**—
though heaven and earth are vast,
their **transformations** are **uniform**;
though the **ten thousand things** are many,
their **governance** is **one**;
though humans are numerous,
their **master** is the **sovereign** (*jūn*).

The **sovereign** is **thick with virtue** and **complete in heaven**,
thus it is called the **profound ancient sovereign** (*Xuángǔ zhī jūn*).
Under the **Dao/Way**, the **sovereign** is **without action**—
this is the **virtue/power of heaven** alone.

Observing the **Dao/Way** in **governance** clarifies the **sovereign’s rectitude**,
observing the **Dao/Way** in **division** makes the **duties of lord and subject** clear,
observing the **Dao/Way** in **capacity** brings the **sovereign’s governance** to completion,
observing the **Dao/Way** broadly reveals the **response of all things** fully.

Thus, what **permeates heaven and earth**—
this is **virtue/power** (*dé*).
What **operates among the ten thousand things**—
this is the **Dao/Way** (*dào*).

The *Zhāngyǒng* (*True Scripture of Dao and Virtue*) *Collection of Meanings*—
**Volume Three** ends.
**Volume Four**—
**Master Yōngyuǎn**’s *Observation of the Profound Subtlety of the Constant Dao/Way*.

**Chapter: "The Dao/Way That Can Be Spoken Of"**

Master Liu Weiyong, appointed to oversee and compile,
Formerly honored as *Grand Secretary* and *Clerk of the Treasury*,
Concurrently *Editor of the Secretariat*,
Ding Yidong, *Inspector of the Imperial Academy*, verified the text.

*"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of"*—
Master Yucheng said: *"The gateway to the Dao/Way that can be spoken of."*

The Dao/Way—
the complete essence of the *Supreme Ultimate*,
the all-encompassing name of ten thousand principles.
From *Hun-Meng*’s primordial division,
to the settled *Aoxi*’s foundation,
it was named *Dao/Way* for its strength.
What is called the Dao/Way
has never been beyond speech—
yet its profound subtlety, its ineffable mystery,
are beyond what ordinary mortals can articulate.

Heaven and earth are but one thing within the Dao/Way;
where there is a thing, there must be a name.
That which is light and clear, ascending—
this is called *Heaven*;
that which is heavy and turbid, descending—
this is called *Earth*.
What is manifest and visible—
the sun and moon;
what is radiant and patterned—
the stars and constellations.
All may name them—
yet why they are light and clear,
why they are heavy and turbid,
why they endure in luminosity without ceasing—
what principle underlies this?
Who among ordinary folk can name it?

The Master spoke of *human nature* and the *Dao/Way of Heaven*;
even Zigong, with his *hearing one thing and knowing two*,
could not grasp it—
how much less those who fall short of Zigong?
If even *hearing* it is impossible,
how could one presume to discuss it?

Ah! The Master was a Sage—
Zigong merely a common scholar.
Program Yi-chuan once pointed to a table and asked Shao Kangzhe:
*"Where is this table located?"*
*"Where is Heaven and Earth?"*
Kangzhe expounded its principle to the utmost,
even beyond the six directions.
Yi-chuan sighed:
*"All my life, only Zhou Moshu has spoken thus."*
Kangzhe’s son, Bo-wen, recorded it—
yet only said *"he expounded to the utmost"* without detailing what was said,
so later scholars could never grasp its essence.
Could this be what ordinary mortals can speak of,
what ordinary mortals can name?

Before the *Supreme Ultimate* divided,
before *Yin-Yang*’s indistinctness took form,
no name had yet been established—
thus it was called *the Nameless*,
the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
*Beginning*—
speaking of its first emergence.

Once names were established,
Yin and Yang had the names *Yin* and *Yang*,
the ten thousand things had their respective names—
thus all transformations and changes arose from this,
all myriad branches and tendrils sprang from this.
Hence it was called *the Named*,
the *Mother of the Ten Thousand Things*.
*Mother*—
that from which all things derive their birth.
Just as *Kun* is called *Mother*,
for it is the source from which all things draw sustenance.

*"Constantly without, yet constantly with"*—
this is the punctuation.

The Dao/Way as a thing is still yet dynamic,
not to be found in mere *nothingness*—
for then its wonder would not be seen;
not to be found in mere *somethingness*—
for then its periphery would not be glimpsed.
*Wonder*—
the utmost *profound*, the utmost *essential*,
the extreme of subtlety.
*Periphery*—
the borderlands, where the Great Dao’s edge meets lesser paths, called *jiao*.
*Jiao*—
also *return*.
To *seek*—
this is to *aspire*.

Those who study the Dao/Way well
constantly, in *timelessness*, pursue the *supreme ultimate*—
for they seek to observe its utmost wonder;
constantly, in *timeliness*, pursue the *supreme ultimate*—
for they seek to observe its peripheral paths.

*Nothingness* and *somethingness* oppose yet arise together,
same source, different names—
both are called *profound*.
*Profound*—
the extreme of wonder,
beyond speech or description,
not merely *profound*, but *profound yet more profound*.

Spanning antiquity and eternity,
exhausting Heaven and Earth,
wonderfully manifold yet differing—
emerging, it emerges;
entering, it does not enter—
this is the *gateway*.

Master Lin of Yongzhai interpreted this chapter:
*"The Dao/Way is originally beyond speech;
once speech is applied, all is secondary meaning."*

*Constant*—
unchanging, unalterable.
What can be spoken of, what can be named—
this is change, this is alteration;
what cannot be spoken of, what cannot be named—
this is no change, no alteration.
His reasoning is lofty—
yet upon close reflection,
if *"what can be spoken of"* is not the *eternal Dao/Way*,
then *"what can be named"* is not the *eternal Name*—
this may conflict with the later phrase *"the Named, Mother of the Ten Thousand Things."*

The character *Dao* in *"The Dao/Way"* is static and weighty;
the *Dao/Way* in *"can be spoken of"* and *"constant Dao/Way"* is dynamic and light—
the same for *name*.
This chapter opens the *Scripture*—
Laozi’s grand intent for all who study.
Those who seek the Dao/Way’s utmost foundation
must begin here.
Scholars of the *Scripture* should ponder it deeply.

Xu Liu said:
*"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of—
this is not the eternal Dao/Way."*
The Dao/Way opens to reverence, touching the taboo—
like one who does not yet understand
but merely hears and draws a snake’s foot.

Originally, *Hun-Meng* was formless, nameless—
since the opening of creation,
anciently enduring,
beyond the grasp of great wisdom,
beyond the speech of divine mouths.
The Sage knew it in silence,
yet could not bear for later ages to remain ignorant—
thus, he named it *Dao/Way* as a metaphor for the formless, the nameless,
so that it might be accessible,
transmitted to later learners.
Hence it was called *Dao/Way*.
Taking its meaning of *transmission*.

Yet even so,
this is but its *form*—
not yet its *reality*.
The *reality* of a single character
must be personally verified in sincerity, enlightenment, and self-attainment.
Only then does it have true application.
If so,
one may endure alongside Heaven and Earth,
shine alongside the sun and moon.
Otherwise,
merely discussing texts, theories, and words—
like the cold speaking of silk brocade,
the hungry speaking of feasts—
this pleases the ears of the beautiful,
yet offers no real benefit to the Dao/Way.
How could it endure?

Thus the *Scripture* says:
*"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of—
this is not the eternal Dao/Way."*
Since what can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao/Way,
then the character *Dao* is clarified—
it is for the seeker to attain it themselves.

*"The Name that can be named—
this is not the eternal Name."*
The character *Dao* itself
is but the name for the formless, the nameless.
If one does not attain its reality,
merely clinging to the *name* that can be named—
like the wind, like a sudden rain—
how could it endure without ceasing?

*"The Nameless—
the beginning of Heaven and Earth."*
Speaking of Heaven and Earth’s origin—
their origin lies in the *Nameless*.

「Having a name, the mother of all things.
Speaking of the origin of Heaven and Earth’s names,
all things and events arise from this Dao/Way.
Mother—this is the act of giving birth.
These two lines express the sage’s great intent
to urge people to exhaust principles and perfect their nature.
Ah, human life is one with Heaven and Earth.
What difference is there in the principle of the mother?
Why do they not investigate it?

Thus it is said:
*"Always without desire, observe its subtlety.*
These two sentences, the sage opens
the gate of awakening for later generations,
so that students may explore here
and surely attain some realization.
Why so?
Constant—this is the eternal Dao/Way.
Without desire and with desire,
the stillness and motion of the eternal Dao/Way.
Observe—this is to scrutinize.
Mysterious—this is the profound subtlety.
Subtlety—this is the return.
Yan Zi said:
*"Subtlety is the return of virtue/power.*
In tranquil repose, without thought or care,
this is the stillness of the eternal Dao/Way.
Here one can discern the eternal Dao/Way’s
profound subtlety in its original essence,
thus it is said: *‘Always without desire, observe its subtlety.’*
With sensation comes understanding;
responding to affairs and engaging with things—
this is the motion of the eternal Dao/Way.
Here one can perceive the eternal Dao/Way’s
adaptive functions and their ultimate return,
thus it is said: *‘Always with desire, observe its subtlety.’*
Clarifying its essence, comprehending its functions,
knowing its return—
the sage’s learning is complete.
If one does not know its return,
wandering and forgetting the way back—
this is the common folk.
Knowing the essence but not its functions,
this is a one-sided scholar.
Not yet awakened to its essence
yet able to adorn its functions—
this is scholasticism.
When essence and function are both illuminated,
through myriad transformations and changes,
the Dao/Way is nowhere absent—
this is the highest learning.
These two share a common origin yet differ in name.
These two, pointing to the prior *having* and *not having*,
profound subtlety and return—
their commonality lies in the eternal Dao/Way.
Differing in name, yet these two names arise,
thus it is said: *‘They share an origin yet differ in name.’*
The eternal Dao/Way, before its manifestation,
has no distinction of *having* or *not having*,
profound subtlety or return—
this is their commonality.
Once manifested, it has the names of *not having* and *profound subtlety/return*—
this is their difference.
Thus it is said: *‘They share an origin yet differ in name.’*
That which is called *profound* is named so for its depth and distance.
If one can know the two’s unmanifested commonality,
then their learning is profound and far-reaching indeed.
Profound—this is depth and distance,
thus it is said: *‘That which is called profound is named so for its depth and distance.’*
He who travels far must reach some destination;
though their attainment may be distant,
if they have not yet reached the ultimate,
then their attainment is not yet at its peak.
The *profound* again *profound*—
the gate of all mysteries.
Again *profound*, then their attainment reaches the ultimate,
and the ultimate is called the *gate of all mysteries*.
The *gate of all mysteries*—
five thousand profound teachings and boundless subtle meanings,
all arise from this.
The sage opened this gate,
hoping later students might enter;
those who pass through the gate yet do not enter—
this is not the intent of the words.
Those who lean against the gate and debate—
this is a common occurrence.
When words reach this point,
one cannot help but laugh and leap,
unaware of hands dancing, feet stamping.

Li Shifu said:
*"The gate of the Dao/Way that can be spoken of—*
The Dao/Way exists within the mind,
everyday and ordinary,
responding flexibly to circumstances,
nowhere absent, at ease and without action—
this is the true eternal Dao/Way.
Those who can separate external false pursuits,
calm their minds, and cling to other affairs—
this is not the Dao/Way of their ordinary practice.
The Dao/Way originally has no name,
yet from this single *qi* arise Heaven and Earth and all things.
Having a name—this is the mother of all things.
Before the mind’s inclination arises,
there is no knowledge of cleverness or clumsiness,
yet it produces myriad instruments and assigns them names—
this is the mind giving birth to the mother of all things.
*‘Always without desire, observe its subtlety’*—
this is to always have no attachment to desires,
returning the light to observe its original nature,
the true subtlety.
*‘Always with desire, observe its return’*—
this is to always have desires,
observing the paths of seeking life and following return—
this is the way of subtlety.
These two share an origin yet differ in name—
without desire, entering stillness;
with desire, emerging into motion—
motion and stillness share the same original source,
thus they have differing names.
That which is called *profound* is named so—
it is the same as the original mind,
before its manifestation, difficult to measure.
The *profound* again *profound*—
the minds of common people are unfathomable,
what of the sage’s mind?
Deep and mysterious in intent,
even the profound cannot be fully explored.
The *gate of all mysteries*—
all adaptive responses arise from this,
and its mysteries are boundless.

Su Jingjing said:
*"The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao/Way.*
The Dao/Way—this is the Dao/Way of Heaven;
the name—this is the name of the Dao/Way.
If the Dao/Way of Heaven can be pointed to as the Dao/Way of the world,
then it is not the eternal Dao/Way of my ordinary practice;
if the name of the Dao/Way can be pointed to as the name of the world,
then it is not the eternal name of my ordinary usage.
The Dao/Way of Heaven is one with nature,
yet the Dao/Way of the world has distinctions:
the Dao/Way of the sovereign, the Dao/Way of the king, the Dao/Way of the tyrant.
The name of the Dao/Way is one with clarity and tranquility,
yet the names of the world have differences:
benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness.
The Dao/Way of Laozi is natural,
and its name is clarity and tranquility—
this is indeed different from the Dao/Way and name
of what the world calls Dao/Way and name.
Laozi was born in the declining Zhou dynasty,
witnessing the Dao/Way of the king already in decline
and the Dao/Way of the tyrant about to rise.
He thought to govern with the natural Dao/Way of Heaven,
and saw that propriety was the root of thin trustworthiness,
the beginning of chaos.
Whether benevolence or righteousness,
whether wisdom or trustworthiness,
all were in tumultuous confusion.
He sought to transform with clarity and tranquility, without action,
thus there arose the words: *‘The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao/Way.’*
His learning was applied by Han Wen and Cao Can,
achieving the effects of tranquility and the songs of unity.
The Western Jin did not apply it well,
and it led to the calamity of empty debate—
each follows their own use, that is all.
The *Nameless* is the mother of all things.
The *Great Polarity* (太极), the *Chaotic Undivided* (浑沦),
Heaven and Earth—even these have no name,
is this not the beginning of Heaven and Earth?
Though Heaven and Earth have not yet come into being,
they are already contained within the *Great Polarity*,
thus it is said: *‘The beginning of Heaven and Earth.’*」

When Heaven and Earth first began to differentiate,
and all things then took on names,
is this not the mother of all things?
Once Heaven and Earth existed,
all things were born within their embrace—
thus it is said: *the mother of all things.*

To observe its subtlety through eternal non-desire.

The *Great Polarity* spans ancient and modern times,
with principle yet no form—
without form, it is the subtle.

Thus, one must observe its subtlety through non-being.

Heaven and Earth give birth to all things,
eternally present from ancient to modern times—
with being, it is the manifest.

Thus, one must observe its manifest through being.
*Manifest* refers to boundaries.

When all things come into being,
one must exhaust their four edges
to observe their all-encompassing generation.

Being arises from non-being,
yet non-being cannot generate being.
Laozi wrote his book,
establishing speech on the two characters *being* and *non-being*,
for he saw that the *Yijing*, *Shujing*, *Shijing*, and *Chunqiu*
all spoke of *being*—
yet I say *being arises from non-being*,
and non-being cannot generate being—
this is indeed lofty and profound,
yet it falls into emptiness and nothingness.

Yet, when viewed through Laozi’s teachings,
it is not entirely empty and nothingness.

As when one does not see what is desired,
the heart remains undisturbed;
as when one rejects cleverness and profit,
thieves and robbers cease to exist;
as when one assists the sovereign with the Dao/Way,
rather than using force to dominate the world;
as when fine weapons are deemed inauspicious instruments,
and governance is conducted with rectitude,
while warfare employs stratagem—
the more taboos a land has, the poorer its people grow;
the more tools of profit proliferate, the more the state grows dim;
the more ingenious devices and strange things arise,
the more laws are enacted, the more thieves appear;
as when one acts before things exist,
and governs before chaos arises;
as when the people’s hunger stems from excessive taxation by their rulers,
and their unruliness arises from the rulers’ excessive actions.

All words conform to principle.
Indeed, the Master Lao speaks of *wu* (無) yet does not neglect *you* (有), while the *Yijing*, *Shijing*, *Shujing*, and *Chunqiu* speak of *you* yet sometimes overlook *wu*—how can one simply reduce this to the doctrine of *qingjing wuwei*?

These two are called *xuan* (玄). The two—*you* and *wu*—
though they arise from the Dao/Way, bear different names, yet are both called *xuan*.
*Xuan* is *xuanmiao* (玄妙).
Though their names differ, both reach the utmost subtlety:
*Wu* generating *you*—the subtlety of *wu*;
*You* arising from *wu*—the subtlety of *you*.
Their principle is *xuanmiao*, yet both are called *xuan*—
thus one cannot dismiss *you* entirely.
*Xuan* again *xuan*, the gateway to all subtleties.
To obliterate *you* and *wu* and call it *xuan*—
that is not *xuan* at all; it may be called *xuan* again *xuan*.

*Wu* generates *you*, *you* arises from *wu*—
all virtues under heaven, all subtleties gathered here,
all spring from this—is it not *xuan* again *xuan*?

Wu Huanzhong said:
*"The chapter 'The Dao that can be spoken of...'*
Is the Dao truly a thing?
I cannot know it.
Is the Dao truly not a thing?
I cannot know that either.
Then what is the Dao?
Its great origin lies in Heaven—
Heaven is the Dao itself.
Between Heaven and Earth, only the Dao is supreme,
existing before all things were born.
When they came to be, then the name *Dao* arose.
Ah, how easily spoken is the Dao!

In the time of King Zhao of Zhou,
Laozi composed the *Five Thousand Words on the Dao and Virtue*,
grieved by Zhou’s decline, the proliferation of deceit among people,
and the treacherous paths of the age.
He sought to restore the pure ancient ways,
thus in the first chapter, he first expounded on the pivot of the Dao—
eternal Dao, eternal name,
the boundless subtlety of *you* and *wu*,
*xuan* again *xuan*, the gateway to all subtleties—
his meaning hidden yet not revealed,
his words seemingly simple yet profound.

From the Han to now,
commentators number in the hundreds,
each offering their own views,
daring neither to fabricate divergent interpretations
nor to cite the Classics, histories, or commentaries as proof.
They merely delve into Laozi’s text itself,
lest they err.

The principles of *renyi* (仁義), *lili* (禮樂), governance, law, warfare,
finance, seeking talent, ruling the state, and pacifying the people—
these have been thoroughly explained by other schools.

In broad strokes, *Laozi* teaches one to cultivate and observe
in the formless and shadowless,
to act at the moment life and death’s mechanism first stirs—
yet it is not the same as the Confucian *Dao* of "no scheming, no self."
Pushing both extremes to their limits—
this is how it differs from the *Dao* of our scholars.

Truly, as Wen Gong Zhu Ziyang said:
*"Within Laozi’s text lies the intent of transcendence—
merely seizing one’s own advantage,
practicing *qingjing wuwei* alone."*
These words exhaust the meaning of Laozi.

The Dao that Laozi speaks of
is not the common Dao of the world.

The words say: *"There is a thing that blends into unity,
born before Heaven and Earth;
It is also said: 'Go to meet it and you do not see its head,
follow it and you do not see its back.
This is the Dao of Laozi—
the Dao that can be spoken of is not the common Dao of the world.
The names that Laozi speaks of
are not the common names of the world,
thus his words: 'I do not know its name,
yet I forcefully name it';
It is also said: *'See it and you do not perceive,
call it *yi* (夷);
Listen to it and you do not hear,
call it *xi* (希).
This is the naming of Laozi—
yet it is not the naming of common names.
Thus it continues: 'The Nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;
The Named is the mother of all things.
Neither the common Dao nor the common name,
being and non-being interweaving—
the being does not cling to being,
the non-being does not fixate on non-being.
Non-being precedes, being follows not;
Born yet not possessed—
this is the mother of the Dao.
Thus, from the formless observe the Dao’s subtlety,
from the formed observe the Dao’s limits.
Subtlety and limits, being and non-being,
emerge from the same source yet bear different names,
both called *xuan* (玄).
*Xuan* means profound and deep—
not derived from color.
Profound beyond profound,
deep beyond measure,
the origin of all subtleties.
The gate of entry and exit for being and non-being—
few attain this gate.
Its greatness knows no outer bounds,
its smallness knows no inner void—
dim and vague within it,
yet there is an image;
vague and dim within it,
yet there is a thing.
The Dao is the hidden mystery of all things—
none can enter its boundless void,
how could it not be the gate of all subtleties?
In the first chapter of *Laozi*,
the Dao’s pivotal principle is discussed,
using the terms *you* (有) and *wu* (无) to penetrate both the common Dao and common names,
as the essence of the entire book—
yet it does not fully reveal the Dao,
only glimpses appear throughout.
It repeatedly reflects and conceals itself,
until Heaven attains *yī* (一) to become clear,
Earth attains *yī* to become tranquil,
Spirits attain *yī* to become luminous,
and the Valley attains *yī* to become full.
Ah! he sighs: *'Yī! Yī!
Is this not the root and foundation of the Dao?*
This *yī*—
when gathered, it is non-being;
when dispersed, it is being.
Zhuang Zhou said: *'When a man attains *yī*, all things are complete.'*
Indeed, these words are true—
the Dao is born from *yī*,
and one can truly attain this Dao.
By perfecting emptiness and steadfastly preserving stillness,
knowing the strong yet holding to the weak,
knowing the bright yet holding to the dark,
focusing *qi* to attain softness—
one can be like an infant,
entering and exiting life and death,
passing through water and fire,
penetrating metal and stone,
riding the void and mastering the wind.
This is what the world calls *my Dao* as if it were not so,
and common men hearing it laugh in scorn.
Wu Jun praised: *'None are deeper in the Dao than the Five Thousand Words.'*
Does he deceive me?
Chai Yuan Gao said: *'The Dao is without extremity yet is the Great Extremity,
its essence is void yet its manifestation is real,
its inner is constrained while its outer is vast.
The Dao that can be spoken of is not the common Dao—
eternal and unchanging,
one true and enduring—
this is the constant Dao.
The constant Dao is beyond words,
yet it is not without words—
it is the speech of the unspeakable.
The unspeakable is the essence of the four seasons,
the manifestation in all things—
its essence is birth, its use is action,
the birth and action of this very thing
are the speech of the unspeakable.
To truly grasp this principle,
one must quietly contemplate within stillness
the lively, unrestrained one—
only then will one know the unspeakable sovereign.
Cultivating the Dao,
one takes nature as the body,
life as the use—
nurturing the spirit makes nature luminous,
nurturing *qi* strengthens life.
The spirit is the silent speech within,
yet cannot speak outwardly—
it must rely on *qi* to express itself.
*Qi* is the outward utterance,
yet it also silently speaks within—
one must forget speech to nurture the spirit.
This is the real use of the formless—
words cannot convey it,
thus it is called the Dao that can be spoken of yet is not the common Dao.
When the practice is complete,
the Dao that emerges is truly the constant Dao.

The essence is difficult to name, thus called *miao* (妙).
The limits are difficult to name, thus called *jiao* (徼).
*Jiao* means "return" (归).
The subtlety of being and non-being—
both emerge from the same essence,
yet their names differ in use.
The essence is profound and subtle,
the use is also profound and subtle.
The gate of all subtleties—
this gate is where the *bu* (阖) and *kai* (辟) of Heaven and Earth unfold,
where essence and use intermingle.
Only those who observe with no desires
can truly grasp this gate.
The Master of One-ness said:
*'The Dao that can be spoken of is the gate of all subtleties.
The Dao has no place yet is everywhere—
if one says it is non-being,
Heaven, Earth, and all things emerge from it;
if one says it is being,
its form and substance cannot be named.
What can be seen is only the constant—
the constant has no beginning or end,
no past or future,
neither being nor non-being yet encompassing both,
neither opening nor closing yet moving through all openings and closings.
To name the Dao as the Dao that can be spoken of,
to name the names as the names that can be named—
how can this exhaust the constant?
When it is called Dao and also called name,
the Dao is hidden while the name is manifest.
Again, the name—
this is to shape the Dao.
To say it is non-being,
it is not truly non-being—
only its name is non-being.
To say it is being,
it is not truly being—
only its name is being.
Thus it is said: 'The Nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;
The Named is the mother of all things.
Man’s birth,
drawing its beginning from the father and its form from the mother—
thus Heaven, Earth, and all things
are fathered by the non-being and mothered by the being.
*Miao* is the subtlety of the being and non-being;
*Jiao* is return (归).'*

「The *Liezi* states: The dead are the Dao’s return (归). Zhang Huan’s annotation says that *miao* (徼) is return (归), which is correct. Indeed, before there was any single thing, the principles of all phenomena were already complete. When the myriad things dispersed and took on distinct forms, none failed to return to their original source. Thus, those who embody the Dao must always be without desire to observe its subtlety (妙), and thereby preserve their spirit (神) to resonate and connect with all under Heaven. This understanding is already realized in the stillness of unchanging repose.

They must also have desire to observe its return (徼), and thereby perceive its cycles, as the constant return to the root and the restoration of vital essence (命) are already evident in the ceaseless interplay of all things. Hence, knowing the subtle and the manifest, one reflects on the vast, grasps the essential to govern all things, and thus the Dao resides within them.

The Dao’s essence and function are one source, with its subtle and manifest aspects inseparable, so it is said: *“These two [subtlety and return] share a common origin but differ in name.”*

*Xuān* (玄) signifies profound and distant meaning. When called *xuān*, it is said that the Sage and the Dao are as one, encompassing both the refined and the coarse, motion and stillness, transcending being and non-being—so that neither being nor non-being can truly name it. Thus, it is entrusted to *xuān*, as if to say: *“Deep and distant, yet no name can suffice.”*

This is the great and transforming work of the Dao—*xuān* beyond *xuān*—the unknowable essence of the Sage. In its entering and exiting, its coming and going, what is its proper abode yet remains ineffable? Hence, it is called *“the gateway to all subtleties.”*

In the Buddhist tradition, the *constant* (常) is called *true constant* (真常), and *subtlety* (妙) is called *wondrous being* (妙有). The interplay of constant, non-constant, and being is the meaning of *emptiness-form* (空色).

When called *xuān*, it is that which transcends being and non-being.

The *Collected Remnants* (*Shíyí*) records: Yan Junping said: *“The Named is not the Dao. The Nameless is not the Dao. The Constructed is not the Dao. The Unconstructed is not the Dao. That which is Nameless yet names all things, that which is Unconstructed yet constructs all things—*
this is the Dao. The Sage of the Great Peace (太平光师) said: *“When there is opposition, it is duality (客异); when all distinctions are severed, it is the profound unity (玄同). To forget the profound unity itself is to call it *profound-profound* (玄玄).”*
Bing Wen states: *“This chapter illuminates the ultimate essence of the *Double Profound* (重玄), not merely that the Dao which can be spoken of is not the Dao, nor that the Dao which cannot be spoken of is not the Dao. In the *Zhuangzi*, both speech and silence are insufficient to exhaust the Dao. Not only is the Dao always nameless, but even the interplay of named and nameless cannot exhaust the Dao.*

*The Unnamed is the semblance of the Dao. Since both having and non-being cannot exhaust the Dao, it is again entrusted to the *Double Profound* (重玄).”*

The *Cross-Referencing of the Masters* and *Guan Yinzi* state:
*“There is no Dao that can be spoken of; what cannot be spoken of is the Dao.
There is no Dao that can be thought of; what cannot be thought of is the Dao.
Heaven’s flow is unrestrained (怒流), human affairs are intricate (错错然)—*
like the flickering of shadows (若若乎回), like the clashing of nations (戛戛乎国), like the fleeting of semblances (勿勿乎似而非), yet people debate it, cling to it, reject it, praise it, abandon it, or grasp at it. To speak of it is like chasing after a shadow; to think of it is like probing dust. The Sage’s wisdom creates confusion, and even spirits do not recognize it. Only that which cannot be done, cannot be attained, cannot be measured, and cannot be divided is called Heaven, called Vital Essence (命), called Spirit (神), called Profound (玄), and collectively called the Dao.

There is not a single thing that is not Heaven, not a single thing that is not Vital Essence (命), not a single thing that is not Spirit (神), not a single thing that is not Profound (玄). If things are such, how can humans be otherwise? Everyone can be called Heaven, everyone can be called Spirit (神), everyone can be said to attain Vital Essence (命) and penetrate the Profound (玄). Yet one cannot say this thing is Heaven and that is not, this is Spirit and that is not, this is Vital Essence and that is not, this is Profound and that is not.

Thus, those who excel in the Dao understand that within a single thing, Heaven is complete, Spirit is exhausted, Vital Essence is attained, and the Profound is realized. In studying it, one follows the varied names, analyzing them to find their shared reality. In attaining it, one aligns with the unity, forgetting the varied names.”*

Chen Baoyi’s interpretation states:
*“The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. Scholars of the world rarely see the *Guan Yinzi*, yet they often interpret the Dao through the words of a hundred schools and their own conjectures, making them ever more unable to clarify Laozi’s intent.*

*The *Guan Yinzi* says:
If there were a Dao that could not be spoken of, then the Dao and speech would be two. Only when what cannot be spoken of is the Dao do speech and the Dao become one. Yet scholars, upon seeing ‘there is no Dao that can be spoken of,’ often mistakenly believe there is a Dao that *can* be spoken of. If there were a Dao that could be spoken of, it should be said ‘there is a Dao that is not unspeakable,’ not ‘there is no Dao that can be spoken of.’

Now, when it is said: ‘There is no Dao that can be spoken of; what cannot be spoken of is the Dao,’ it is reversing Laozi’s words to clarify his deeper meaning. When reversed, it reads: ‘There is no Dao that cannot be spoken of; what cannot be spoken of is the Dao.’ Once it is reversed to say ‘what cannot be spoken of is the Dao,’ then it is reversed again to say ‘the Dao that can be spoken of is not the Dao.’ This is Laozi’s statement that the Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.

Some still doubt whether ‘can be spoken of’ refers to the Dao of speech. I further reverse the scripture’s words to enlighten them, saying: As when one says ‘emptiness can be emptied, yet it is not true emptiness’—if it can be emptied, then there are things. Where it is blocked yet not emptied, how can it be called true emptiness? Knowing that emptiness can be emptied is not true emptiness, then one knows that the Dao which can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.

Others may illustrate it thus: ‘Like the heart, the heart is like nature (性); nature can all be cultivated through effort.’ If the Dao were something humans could construct, why then cannot the Dao be spoken of as the Dao? Without reversing the meaning beyond words, I would never have been able to clarify Laozi’s scriptural intent in my lifetime.

People of the world are also often misled by the word *constant* (常), thinking Laozi speaks of a Dao beyond the constant. Yet Laozi established this word *constant* precisely to prevent such doubt—that my Dao differs from that of others. They do not realize that this is the universal Dao of all under Heaven. Even the Dao named as Dao is the universal name of all under Heaven.

This Dao penetrates Heaven and Earth, spans the ancient and the present, without a place it does not inhabit. The moment one opens their mouth to speak of it, they are far removed from the Dao. Hence, it is said to be *two* (二).」

The moment one declares this arbitrarily named *name* as a name that can be named, then it is no longer a name. Only because it cannot be named does one use the conventional name to name it arbitrarily—just as one says, "It is not a name that can be named, yet the inability to name it *is* the name."

Thus, what cannot be spoken of *is* the Dao; what cannot be named *is* the name. This is Laozi’s meaning: that which can be spoken of is not the constant Dao, and that which can be named is not the constant name.

Yet Laozi was a great sage—his words like Heaven’s unspeakable speech. Were it not for a sage like Guan Yinzi, who could have further illuminated the meaning beyond the words through unspeakable speech?

But Guan Yinzi, having already illuminated the meaning of what cannot be named or spoken, feared that people might think: if the Dao cannot be named or spoken, then it can be attained through thought. Hence, he further said: "It is not that the Dao cannot be thought, but that which cannot be thought *is* the Dao"—the same intent as before.

Ah! What can be spoken of and thought about are human affairs; what cannot be spoken of or thought about are Heavenly matters. Then how do people and Heaven truly differ in appearance?

One might say: all people can be called Heaven.

Yet can people and Heaven truly be observed as the same?

One might say: Heaven’s phenomena rage like flowing waters, while human affairs are tangled and chaotic—some resemble each other yet turn away, some clash and contend, some seem alike yet are not. Some contend daily with their minds, some remain aloof without engaging, some scold and shout, some murmur and call, some depart and separate, some seek and unite. Heaven’s phenomena and human affairs differ thus—how can they be observed as the same?

Now if one attempts to grasp the Dao through human speech and thought, it is like blowing at shadows or carving dust—only exhausting the mind in vain.

This Dao: even sages and wise ones, when crafting it, remain bewildered; even spirits and gods, when probing it, do not recognize it. Only because it cannot be made, it is called *Heaven*; because it cannot be attained, it is called *Fate*; because it cannot be measured, it is called *Spirit*; because it cannot be divided, it is called *Mysterious*.

Combining these four, one arbitrarily names it *Dao*.

Laozi spoke of the Dao, following it with *constant* and *without desire* to observe its subtlety, *constant* and *with desire* to observe its peril—both called *Mysterious*. Mysterious beyond mysterious, the gateway to all subtleties.

Guan Yinzi feared that scholars would cling to differing names, dissecting the same reality, and thus observe Heaven, Fate, Spirit, and the Mysterious as separate. Hence, in this passage, he reiterates: within a single thing, one can know Heaven, exhaust Spirit, attain Fate, and craft the Mysterious.

All things are thus; all people inherently possess this. It cannot be that this is Heaven and that is not, this is Spirit and that is not, this is Fate and that is not, this is Mysterious and that is not.

Thus, some call it *subtle*, some call it *perilous*, some call it *Mysterious*—yet all things are thus, and all people inherently possess it. Only those who grasp it recognize its unity, forgetting its differences, and call it by name.

As for *Mysterious beyond mysterious*, one may enter the Dao.

Zhuangzi said:
*"There is a beginning, there is what has no beginning yet has a beginning, there is what has no beginning to what has no beginning yet has a beginning, there is what has existence, there is what has non-existence, there is what has no beginning to non-existence, there is what has no beginning to what has no beginning to non-existence. Suddenly, there is non-existence. Yet who knows whether this non-existence is truly non-existent or truly existent?"*

Now, I have already spoken of it, yet I do not know whether my words truly have meaning or truly lack meaning.

With the original as refined, with things as coarse, with accumulation as insufficiency, serene and alone, dwelling with Spirit and Clarity.

In ancient Daoist arts, there was one such as this. Guan Yinzi and Lao Dan heard of its essence and took delight in it, establishing it with *constant non-being*, governing it with *Great Unity*, using *softness, weakness, humility, and lowliness* as its outward form, and *emptiness, voidness, and non-destruction of all things* as its substance.

Wenzi said:
*"What gives rise to affairs responds to changes and moves accordingly. Change is governed by time, and its actions are without constancy."*

Thus, the Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao, and the name that can be named is not the constant name.

Books are born from speech. Speech arises from the wise who do not know—this is the non-constant Dao. What can be named is not the act of preserving books.

In ancient times, those with unbound hair and no collar ruled under Heaven. Their virtue was born without killing, gave without taking, and all under Heaven, though empty, cherished their virtue.

At that time, yin and yang were harmonious, and all things flourished. Birds’ nests could be reached by leaning down, and wild beasts could be tethered and followed.

When it declined, birds, beasts, insects, and serpents all became human hazards. Thus, iron was cast and blades were forged to defend against them.

When people were pressed by these hazards, they sought convenience; when plagued by troubles, they prepared defenses. Each used their wisdom to avoid what harmed them and pursue what benefited them.

Since constancy cannot be followed, and tools cannot be relied upon, the laws of the ancient kings had variations.

Thus, it is said: what can be named is not the constant name.

The Five Constants differ in Dao yet cover all under Heaven; the Three Kings varied in affairs yet their names endure in posterity.

They adapted to the times and changed accordingly.

For instance, the music master’s tuning of the five tones shifts up and down without fixed measurements, yet never misses the mark.

Thus, those attuned to the emotions of music can compose sounds with roots, centered in harmony. Those who understand the uses of compasses, squares, hooks, and cords can govern people. Hence, the ancient kings’ distinctions, though not rigidly enforced, were followed in the later ages. Thus, sages established rites and music without being bound by law.

Hence, it is said: the Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.

To alleviate poverty and relieve urgency brings forth names of profit and harm, removes accumulated ills, and achieves success. When the world has no disasters, even sages have no virtue to apply, and when all are harmonious, even the virtuous have no deeds to establish.

Thus, the governance of the perfected sage embraces virtue, holds to the Dao, extends sincerity, and applies boundless wisdom—resting in speechlessness, unknown to the world. Their speechlessness is honored, hence the Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao, and the name that can be named is not the constant name.

What is inscribed upon bamboo and silk, carved upon metal and stone, and thus transmitted to humanity—these are but its superficial traces.

The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, the Three Kings, though their deeds differed, shared a singular intent; though their paths diverged, their ultimate aim was one.

Scholars of the later ages, failing to grasp the essence of the Dao or the unity of virtue, seek only to advance their own achievements. Kneeling or seated, they speak of it, though their vast learning and wide hearing only lead them further into confusion.

Stone Tan said: *"The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao."* This passage has two divergent interpretations.

Some take the opening *"The Dao that can be spoken of"* as the Dao that can be attained through speech, while *"the constant Dao"* refers to that which cannot be spoken. Others interpret *"The Dao that can be spoken of"* as the Dao spoken of by Laozi, and *"the constant Dao"* as the Dao spoken of by ordinary people.

Yet if the first *"Dao"* is taken as the Dao that can be spoken of, then Laozi would invert the world’s conception of Dao by placing it at the beginning of his text, making this *"Dao"* not his own. Would Laozi name his work *"Dao"* only to immediately speak of the world’s Dao?

If instead the first *"Dao"* is Laozi’s own Dao—meaning *"My Dao is not the Dao of the common people"*—this also holds some plausibility. Yet then *"the constant Dao"* would refer to the Dao of the common people, as in Confucius An Guo’s *"Book Sequence"* where *"the constant Dao"* is mentioned.

But the next chapter speaks of *"knowing the constant as clarity,"* and this chapter itself contains *"constantly without desire to observe its subtlety, constantly with desire to observe its peril."* Would *"constant"* here mean merely the ordinary?

Both interpretations seem flawed. After careful reconsideration, it appears that both the opening *"Dao"* and the subsequent *"constant Dao"* refer to the essence of the Dao itself. The *"Dao that can be spoken of"* is the Dao as commonly understood by people. If one says, *"My Dao is not the Dao that can be pointed to by the world,"* then the Dao that can be named is not the Dao of natural constancy that I speak of.

The *"constant"* refers to that which is ever-present in all things, unchanging through time, eternally enduring from antiquity to the present. The Dao as commonly spoken of—what Confucius called *"the lesser Dao"* and Mencius *"the divided Dao"*—is the Dao of daily practice and common conduct. But Laozi’s Dao is the singular, void, and natural principle itself.

*"The name that can be named is not the constant name."* This passage also has two interpretations.

Some take the opening *"name"* as the name of the common world, while others take it as the name of the Dao. The distinction in meaning mirrors that of the previous passage.

Following the earlier pattern, the opening *"name"* and the subsequent *"constant name"* both refer to the naming of the Dao. The Dao itself cannot truly be named, yet we designate it as *"Dao"* by force of convention. If it could be named, then its names would be relative—such as the *"beautiful and ugly, difficult and easy, long and short, high and low"* mentioned in the next chapter—which cannot be considered the *"constant name."* Thus, these two sentences serve only to elucidate the previous two, explaining the later chapter’s assertion that the Dao is forcibly named.

*"Nameless, the origin of heaven and earth. Named, the mother of ten thousand things."* This passage also has two interpretations.

Some punctuate it as *"Nameless, named,"* while others as *"Without, with."* The latter seems more elevated. Yet the next chapter speaks of *"the Dao constantly without name at its origin, then named in its manifestation,"* so perhaps this too could be punctuated thus.

Those who punctuate *"Nameless, named"* are correct. The essence of the Great Dao is boundless and formless, yet all phenomena are already manifest within it. Because it is boundless and formless, it cannot be named, hence *"Nameless."* Though nameless, it is the origin of heaven and earth. Because all phenomena are already present, their principles can be named, hence *"Named."* Once named, it becomes the mother of all things.

*"Origin"* refers to its source—being generated from the void, hence *"origin."* *"Mother"* refers to its latent presence, like an embryo already formed, hence *"mother."* This *"origin"* is akin to the *"Great Origin"* in the *Yijing*, and *"mother"* is akin to the *"completion of things."* But the *Yijing* speaks primarily of Heaven and Earth, while this text focuses solely on the Dao.

*"Constantly without desire, one observes its subtlety; constantly with desire, one observes its peril."* This passage also has two interpretations.

Some punctuate it at *"without"* and *"with,"* following Zhuangzi. Indeed, the *"Heaven and Earth"* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* speaks of *"establishing it with constant non-being,"* directly echoing this passage’s *"constant without, constant with."* Yet the later chapter of the *Laozi* itself contains the phrase *"constant without desire,"* making it unlikely to punctuate at *"without."*

Punctuating at *"desire"* conflicts with the *Zhuangzi*, while punctuating at *"without"* conflicts with the later chapter. Yet the *Zhuangzi* most faithfully captures the *Laozi’s* essence—could the *"without desire"* in the later chapter be a mere coincidence, not to be taken as precedent?

Since both interpretations have merit, neither should be discarded. Punctuating at *"without"* and *"with"* speaks to the nature of the Dao itself; speaking of *"constant without desire"* and *"constant with desire"* addresses how humanity embodies the Dao.

The constant Dao is hidden in the void, hence its subtlety can be observed there; the constant Dao manifests in the having, hence its perils can be observed there.

The subtlety refers to that which cannot be named; the perils refer to that which has names.

If one punctuates at *"desire"*, then humanity’s ability to remain without desire reveals the Dao’s constant subtlety—this is akin to what the *Great Classic of Change* calls *"tranquil and motionless"*. The Dao’s constant perils appear where desire exists—this is akin to what the *Great Classic of Change* calls *"stirred and thus responsive"*.

To perceive the Dao’s constant subtlety in the absence of desire and its constant perils in the presence of desire is to grasp the Dao’s essence and function.

These two are of the same origin yet bear different names, both called *Xuan* (玄).
This is the Confucian teaching of *"essence and function are one source, manifest and subtle without separation"*.

The two—having and non-having—
the Dao takes non-having as its essence, having as its function.
Both arise from the Dao, hence called *"one source"*.
Yet having and non-having are distinct names:
non-having is the subtle,
having is the manifest,
and only because of their shared source are they without separation.

Now, what is called *Xuan* (玄)?
It is neither having nor non-having,
yet it is not as if one can say it is non-having—
then its function would seem to be having.
Hence it is called *Xuan*.
*Xuan* means that having and non-having cannot be divided.

*Xuan* beyond *Xuan*—
the gate through which all subtleties pass.
Zhuangzi said:
*"There are those who speak of having-having,
those who speak of having-non-having,
those who speak of neither having nor non-having,
and those who speak of neither having nor non-having yet also not of having that which is neither having nor non-having."*

That which can be named is Zhuangzi’s *"having-having"*;
that which cannot be named is Zhuangzi’s *"having-non-having"*,
while *Xuan* is neither having nor non-having—
yet if one says it is non-having,
then it is *"neither having nor non-having"*,
and if it is *Xuan* beyond *Xuan*,
then it is *"neither having nor non-having yet also not of having that which is neither having nor non-having"*.

*Xuan* cannot be spoken of as having or non-having,
and *Xuan* beyond *Xuan* cannot be spoken of even as *Xuan*—
though *Xuan* beyond *Xuan* it is,
within the single principle are myriad principles contained,
and the subtleties of all principles emerge from this,
hence it is called the *gate*.

Now, to have one principle give rise to myriad principles—
this seems akin to the Confucian Dao.
Yet it ultimately differs from the Confucian Dao,
for the Confucian school takes concrete things as primary,
and the Dao is found within them,
while this takes emptiness and non-being as primary,
and focuses solely on the Dao’s essence,
transcending the coarse nature of concrete things.

**Volume Five of *Collected Meanings of the True Classic of the Dao and Virtue***

Master Yǒngyuǎn’s profound and subtle exposition of the Dao’s vast virtue,
with Sī Wéiyǒng’s compilation of observations,
and Dīng Yìdōng’s annotations—
a former imperial scholar and editor of the Secretariat Bureau,
with variant readings noted.

**Chapter: "All Under Heaven Know" (天下皆知章)**

**Variant Readings:**
- *Héshànggōng* composed *The Chapter on Nourishing the Body* (《养身章》),
- Zhào Shí’ān composed *The Chapter on the True and Eternal Integration of Principles* (《真常融摄义章》).

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Commentary:**
The preceding chapter illuminated the wondrous origin of transformation,
distinguishing the twofold observation [of Dao].
This chapter elucidates the undifferentiated and scattered names of *Pu* (the Uncarved),
arising from myriad distinctions—
as distinctions arise, so does wandering,
but virtuous transformation returns to the root.

Thus, it first marks the entanglement of beauty, goodness, and delusion,
then demonstrates the interplay of presence and absence,
and concludes with the Sage’s principle,
hoping to swiftly restore the pure and unadulterated.

**Dù Guāngtíng’s Explanation:**
The vast and boundless currents of existence,
the sluggish multitude of living beings—
entering realms, emotions stir;
the farther from the Dao, the more distant they stray.
The Sage pities their forgetfulness and opens this wondrous gate.

The twofold observation of the previous chapter
entered from non-being into being.
This chapter marks the sixfold delusions,
whereby affairs sway the mind.
If one knows the error of following realms
and does not succumb to wandering transformations,
then one may speak of the gradual cultivation of an empty heart and full belly.

**Zhāng Chōngyìng’s Interpretation:**
The Dao precedes the body yet encompasses heaven and earth.
If one aligns with this natural Dao in action,
the spirit is preserved, the essence fortified—
do not chase after things,
do not flaunt one’s talents,
do not crave fame;
fear gain as one seeks loss,
approach the near while dreading the far—
then all calamities fade unseen,
and the body finds its nourishment.
Thus, *Nourishing the Body* follows the chapter on embodying the Dao—
this is *Héshànggōng*’s exposition.

---
**All under heaven know beauty as beauty—**
then ugliness arises.
All under heaven know goodness as goodness—
then wickedness arises.
Thus, presence and absence give rise to each other,
difficulty and ease complete one another,
length and shortness define each other,
high and low contrast each other,
sounds harmonize with each other,
before and after follow each other.

Therefore, the Sage acts in non-action,
teaches without speech—
all things arise yet he does not claim them,
gives birth yet does not possess,
acts yet does not rely upon it,
and when the deed is done, does not dwell upon it.
**Only by not dwelling does it not depart.**

**Variant Readings:**
- "Presence and absence follow each other closely" (有无至相随) alternates with:
  *"Presence and absence give rise to each other, difficulty and ease complete each other..."*
- "All things arise yet he does not claim them" (万物作焉而不辞) alternates with:
  *"All things arise yet he does not initiate"* (万物作焉而不为始).
- "Does not dwell upon it" (弗居) alternates with:
  *"Does not"* (不) or omits the *"while"* (而) entirely.
- "Thus it does not depart" (是以不去) alternates with *"Thus it does not abide"* (不处).

**Héshànggōng’s Explanation:**
All under heaven know beauty as beauty—
this is to boast of one’s own excellence.
Then ugliness arises—
there is peril and ruin.
All under heaven know goodness as goodness—
this is to seek fame and merit.
Then wickedness arises—
it becomes what others contend for.

Thus, presence and absence give rise to each other—
seeing presence as absence.
Difficulty and ease complete each other—
seeing difficulty as ease.
Length and shortness define each other—
seeing shortness as length.
High and low contrast each other—
seeing height as low.
Sounds harmonize—
when one sings, the other must respond.
Before and after follow—
when one advances, the other must incline.

Therefore, the Sage acts in non-action—
governing through the Dao.
Teaches without speech—
leading by personal example.
All things arise—
each moves spontaneously.
Yet he does not refuse—
he does not reject or obstruct.
Gives birth yet does not possess—
the Original Qi generates all things yet does not claim them.
Acts yet does not rely upon it—
the Dao’s work is done without expectation of reward.
When the deed is complete, he does not dwell upon it—
when the work is done, he withdraws, not claiming the position.
**Only by not dwelling does it not depart—**
only by not claiming the deed does the blessing remain,
and it does not abandon the body.

This shows that what is not done cannot be followed,
and what is not spoken cannot be known.

The first six lines speak of high and low, long and short—
the Sage opens one source,
from which a hundred branches arise.
The transformations of these branches
are without fail in motion and disorder.

**Wáng Fǔsì’s Commentary:**
All under heaven know beauty as beauty—
beauty is what the heart delights in.
Ugliness is what the heart abhors.
Beauty and ugliness are like joy and anger,
goodness and wickedness are like right and wrong—
joy and anger share the same root,
right and wrong share the same gate.
Thus, they cannot be partially discarded.

These six are all natural, self-evident truths—
therefore, the Sage’s affairs are complete in their naturalness;
if forced, they fail.
From *"teaches without speech"* to *"does not rely upon it"*—
wisdom is inherently complete;
if forced, it becomes false.
*"When the deed is complete, he does not dwell upon it"*—
acting in accordance with things,
the deed completes itself;
thus, he does not dwell upon it.
**Only by not dwelling does it not depart—**
if the deed is attributed to oneself,
the deed cannot endure.

**Emperor Xuánzōng’s Commentary:**
All under heaven know beauty as beauty—
beauty and goodness arise from desire.
Where the heart desires,
even ugliness becomes beautiful and good.
Thus, it is said:
*"All under heaven know what they themselves deem beautiful as beauty,
and what they themselves deem good as good."*
Beauty and goodness have no inherent master—
they are merely deluded emotions.
This arises from clinging to presence or absence,
distinguishing difficulty and ease,
discerning the marvelous from the vile—
all swaying and contending.
The great Sage weighs these carefully,
knowing their emptiness and delusion,
thus declaring: *"Then ugliness arises."*

**Commentary:**
*"All under heaven"*—
speaking of the general populace beneath heaven’s canopy.
*"Beauty"*—what the heart finds pleasing.
*"Goodness"*—what the body practices.
It is said that all under heaven know what their own hearts find pleasing as beauty,
and what their own bodies practice as goodness.
Thus, in matters of taste, they shun the bitter,
preferring the red;
in matters of virtue, they reject the plain,
favoring the ornate—
mutually swaying, they inevitably stir contention,
all arising from the stirring of desire.
Thus, beauty and ugliness emerge in succession.
The Sage knows beauty and ugliness have no inherent nature—
they are merely deluded emotions.
Delusion is not constant,
hence it is said: *"Then ugliness arises."*

「已， merely a verbal particle for emphasis.

注云 *"Godly wonders and putrid decay"*—
Zhuangzi states: *"What is deemed beautiful is godly wonders, what is deemed ugly is putrid decay"*—this is precisely it.
Thus, the arising of being and non-being is relative.

**Commentary:**
This elucidates the emptiness of being and non-being’s inherent nature.
Non-being does not exist inherently—it arises from being.
The common folk thus assert that being generates non-being.
Being does not exist inherently—it arises from non-being.
The common folk thus assert that non-being generates being.
Hence, it is said *"they arise in relation"*—
though being and non-being are not inherently dependent,
the names of *"relative generation"* stem from deluded perception,
just as beauty and ugliness are not inherently produced—
all are empty.
Thus, the Sage seeks to investigate this deluded entanglement,
and so proceeds to enumerate the sixfold illusions:
Difficulty and ease arise in relation.

**Commentary:**
This elucidates the emptiness of difficulty and ease’s inherent nature.
Because of difficulty, ease arises;
because of ease, difficulty arises.
It is like the artisan who finds his craft easy in shaping but difficult in firing,
or the potter who finds his kiln easy to manage but wood difficult to work.
Hence, it is said *"difficulty and ease arise in relation."*
If one aligns with what is difficult, then ease does not exist;
if one aligns with what is easy, then difficulty does not exist.
Difficulty and ease are without substance—
their names arise from false perception.
Thus, those who comprehend them abandon both skill and clumsiness,
and the names of difficulty and ease cease.
Similarly, beauty and ugliness are without fixed nature.

Length and shortness arise in contrast.

**Commentary:**
This elucidates the emptiness of length and shortness’s inherent nature.
Because of length, shortness appears;
because of shortness, length appears—
hence *"length and shortness arise in contrast."*
The duck’s legs are not short,
yet when compared to the crane’s length, they seem so—
thus, to extend them causes sorrow.
The crane’s legs are not long,
yet when compared to the duck’s shortness, they seem so—
thus, to shorten them causes grief.
Seeing length and shortness arise in contrast,
it is like beauty and ugliness—
without fixed substance,
all are falsely perceived.
Since their forms are empty, their names are also empty—
hence, they are left undefined.

High and low arise in mutual dependence.

**Commentary:**
This elucidates the emptiness of the names *"high"* and *"low."*
The names *"high"* and *"low"* mutually depend,
hence one speaks of *"high"* only in relation to *"low,"*
and one speaks of *"low"* only in relation to *"high."*
Again, when one deems something *"high,"*
it is not truly high—
when one deems something *"low,"*
it is not truly low.
Like the ministers and subjects of past dynasties,
who constantly shift in status,
these names are also without fixed nature—
hence, no fixed position.

Sounds and voices arise in harmony.

**Commentary:**
This elucidates the emptiness of *"harmony"* and *"union."*
When the five tones harmonize to form a melody,
who unifies all the voices?
Then one can measure the song—
as with the laws of past dynasties,
all harmonize and unite,
yet their essence is not truly real—
all are empty.
Thus, when the Sage seeks to establish beauty and ugliness,
how could he speak of such profound observation?

Past and future arise in succession.

**Commentary:**
This elucidates the emptiness of the three times.
Day and night succeed each other—
the new arises from the old.
Who, when casting a footstep, determines *"past"* and *"future"*?
The names *"past"* and *"future"* arise from their succession.
Since names arise from false perception,
and one deceives oneself in recognizing their essence,
the three times—past, present, and future—are empty.
Thus, they constantly change and transform,
just as beauty and ugliness have no fixed names.

The six arise in opposition,
sequentially generating names—
just as beauty and ugliness,
which are not inherently produced,
stem from deluded emotions,
leading to such manifold confusions.
Thus, the Sage’s ultimate teaching.

*"Non-action"*—
this is the teaching of non-action.
It is metaphorically called *"action"*—
hence, *"abiding in the teaching of non-speech"*—
this is the forgetting of speech.
It is metaphorically called *"teaching"*—
hence, *"practicing"*—

**Commentary:**
*"Thus"*—
this explains the lower to clarify the upper.
Though the adorned and deceitful may remain silent,
they are not practicing non-action;
though the natural and simple may give constant orders,
they remain unperturbed.
Thus, the Sage knows all dharmas are of empty nature—
without arrogance or attachment,
one governs the world by rejecting pretenses,
employing pure virtue.
The people transform accordingly,
each content in their allotted place.
Contentment in one’s place brings no disturbance—
is this not the matter of non-action?
Words issue from oneself,
all based on the world’s hearts—
thus, though speaking all day, one has never truly spoken—
is this not the teaching of non-speech?
All things act naturally without complaint.
The Sage allows all things to follow their own movements,
yet they do not thank or reproach the Sage.

**Commentary:**
*"Act"* means movement—
*"complaint"* means gratitude or reproach.
The Sage’s good governance is without action or effort,
yet the people, unaware, rejoice and are content,
each following their own movements,
without thanking or reproaching the Sage.
Thus, they strike the earth and drum their bellies,
forgetting the Emperor’s power—
the people forget the Sage’s deeds.

*"To give birth without possession,
to act without dwelling"*—
allowing things to fulfill their nature,
not claiming them as one’s own,
each attaining their proper course without neglecting caution.
Thus, the great peace’s function is achieved.
It is still necessary to be cautious each day as one was at the beginning—
not daring to rest complacently.

**Commentary:**
Now, all things attain fulfillment in their natural course,
yet the Sage does not possess them.
The Sage allows all things to follow their own cultivation,
yet does not rely upon them as his own merit.
Thus, the great peace’s function is ever more expansive and distant,
yet it is still fitting to remain cautious as at the outset—
not daring to rest complacently—
this is the Sage’s self-forgetting of his merit.
*"It is still necessary to be cautious each day as one was at the beginning"*—
this is the wording of the *Shan Shu*.
The Sage who does not dwell in merit,
thus does not lose it.
The Sage who does not dare rest complacently,
yet constantly refines his virtue,
forgets his merit while it remains—
thus, he does not dwell in it and yet does not lose it.

**Commentary:**
The Sage is upright like a hair,
cautious to the end as at the beginning,
his beginning and end never decaying.
He never rests complacently or indulges in ease,
thus daily renewing his great virtue,
forgetting his merit while it remains,
illuminating his dwelling as the world finds peace.
Hence, it is said: *"The Sage who does not dwell in merit, thus does not lose it."*
Du Guangting states:
*"All under heaven know beauty as beauty,
yet this does not make them virtuous."*
Under heaven, those who know the Dao are few,
the common are many.
Those who cultivate their bodies are few,
those who follow material desires are many.
All know beauty and virtue as correct,
yet few can practice them;
all know ugliness and evil as incorrect,
yet few can abandon them.
Thus, the Sage laments them—
hence *"ugliness has already arisen,"*
*"evil has already arisen."*

To wear virtue and uphold righteousness,
embrace the Dao while maintaining humility,
serve with loyalty and filial piety toward sovereign and kin,
and cherish brotherly harmony among relatives—
these are not merely acts of beauty and goodness,
yet all know them while few can practice them.
To act contrary to these is evil,
yet all know them while few can abandon them—
how much less can they cultivate the Way of *wuwei*?
Thus, they are deceptive.

Delusion (*mang*) is not true principle.
When mind arises from conditions,
emotions stir with things,
and failing to uphold the Dao or follow constancy—
this is delusion indeed.

The wondrous and the foul, the divine and the rotten—
as in the *Zhuangzi*’s *"Know North Game"* chapter,
the Yellow Emperor told Know:
*"All things are one."*
What they deem wondrous becomes divine,
what they abhor becomes foul,
yet foul transforms into divine,
and divine into foul—
thus it is said: *"It permeates Heaven and Earth as one qi."*

The Sage values unity.
This reveals that divine and foul are but the partial nature of things.
A hundred schools and nine currents,
each clinging to their *shi* and *fei*,
mutually passing judgment—
whether governing the body or the realm,
if one acts without doing and trusts in spontaneity,
unifying all with one thread,
then foul and divine naturally become undivided.

Thus, being and non-being generate each other.
Laozi lamented those who cling to constancy,
lost in the true path,
delusively opposing each other,
entangled in illusory emotions—
hence, this principle is taught to loosen their grasp.

*Existence* (*zhu*) is attachment.
To cling to existence is to reject non-being,
to cling to non-being is to reject existence.
To cling to difficulty is to reject ease,
to cling to ease is to reject difficulty.
To cling to short is to reject long,
to cling to long is to reject short.
To cling to high is to reject low,
to cling to low is to reject high.
To cling to later is to reject earlier,
to cling to earlier is to reject later.
Because of this clinging, none reach ultimate truth.

Thus the scripture says: *"The clinging one loses it."*
But without partial attachment,
one naturally aligns with the Middle Way,
entering the gate of profound and true observation.

Difficulty and ease complement each other.
Difficulty arises from ease—
without ease, one cannot know difficulty.
Ease arises from difficulty—
without difficulty, one cannot recognize ease.
In cyclic dependence, each serves its turn.
Examining and clarifying them,
in difficulty there is no obstruction,
in ease there is no attachment—
then one may speak of harmonizing all things,
penetrating the Middle Way.

*A gōng* is a term for skilled craftsmanship,
while *táo* refers to shaping clay into vessels.
Each excels in their own art—this is ease,
but to force them into another’s method—this is difficulty.

Long and short contrast each other.
Things have forms of short and long,
affairs unfold with laws of difficulty and ease,
transformation arises with changes of being and non-being—
all this is natural.
If one clings to common perceptions,
then long must remain long,
short must remain short.
Do difficulty, ease, being, and non-being lie within this?
To be obstructed is attachment;
to be fluid is the Dao.
Only those who follow the Dao can avoid obstruction.

The metaphor of the duck and crane
also comes from the *Zhuangzi*’s *"Interlocking Thumbs"* chapter,
meaning each has its own proper form—
one cannot impose this standard on that,
nor alter it through gain or loss.
This rejects the world’s failure to trust in spontaneity.

High and low incline toward each other.
The establishment of high and low
names forms, status, and positions,
talents, wisdom, and achievements—
within all their diversity, high and low exist.
Thus, it is not merely constrained by titles and rank.

But when the high forget their elevation,
and the low forget their subordination,
each abides in its proper place,
guarding the natural order,
then there will be no usurpation or encroachment.

A subject is the humble designation for a man,
a concubine is the humble designation for a woman.
They are humble and subservient to others,
thus called *chen* and *qie*.
*Cushu*: refers to the doctrine of names and ranks.
This is to broadly warn against the world’s inclinations.

Speaking of the Dao of high and low,
each abides in its proper place,
without encroachment or usurpation,
then it preserves its beginning and end.

If one abandons humility and covets high rank,
or despises lowliness and schemes for exalted position,
failing to accept one’s natural station,
disaster will follow.
Thus the *Classic* says:
*"Knowing contentment brings no disgrace,
knowing restraint brings no peril.
This ensures longevity—
how can one not be warned?"*

Sounds harmonize with one another.
When Heaven and Earth exhale *qi*, all tones arise;
when the *Lü* and *Yue* harmonize, all music is born.
The origin of sound carries beauty or vice with it.
Thus there are distinctions between
serene joy, resentment, anger,
grief, melancholy, and sorrowful lament.

Yet these distinctions,
though imposed by human affairs and followed by governance,
are forgotten by those of penetrating insight.
To follow change while ignoring reality is called *mangqing* (erroneous emotion).
Only when beauty and vice are both forgotten
does one attain the Dao.

Those who grasp the Dao,
though vast as Heaven and Earth,
though teeming as all things,
remain unaffected.

The *Record of Music* states:
*"All sounds arise from the human heart.
The heart, moved by things, manifests in sound.
Sounds resonate and thus create variation—
variation realized is called music.
Comparing sounds to create music,
and using *gan* and *qi* (weapons and feathers) to complete it,
is called *yue* (ritual music).
Thus, when the heart is moved by sorrow,
its sound is sharp and restrained;
when moved by joy,
its sound is bright and slow;
when moved by happiness,
its sound is unrestrained and dispersed;
when moved by anger,
its sound is coarse and fierce;
when moved by reverence,
its sound is upright and austere;
when moved by love,
its sound is harmonious and gentle.
Therefore, the ancient kings were cautious in what moved them,
using ritual to guide their intentions,
music to harmonize their hearts,
governance to unify their actions,
and law to prevent deceit.
Ritual, music, law, and governance—
their ultimate aim is one."*

The Dao of sound and music aligns with governance.
*Gong* is the sovereign,
*Shang* is the minister,
*Jiao* is the people,
*Zheng* is affairs,
*Yu* is things.
If these five remain unconfused,
there will be no discordant tones.

In a well-ordered age, music is serene and joyful—
its governance is harmonious;
in a chaotic age, music is resentful and angry—
its governance is misaligned;
in a doomed state, music is mournful and reflective—
its people are suffering.

If *Gong* is disordered, the land becomes barren,
and its ruler grows arrogant;
if *Shang* is disordered, the officials are corrupt;
if *Jiao* is disordered, the people are anxious;
if *Zheng* is disordered, affairs are laborious;
if *Yu* is disordered, resources are depleted.
When all five are disordered,
they successively oppress one another—this is called *màn* (decadence).

The music of Zheng and Wei
is the music of chaotic times,
comparable to *màn*.
The songs of Sangjian and Puxia
are the music of a dying state—
its governance is scattered,
its people drift away.

Those who know sound but not music
are like beasts;
those who know music but not *yue* (ritual music)
are the common folk.
Only the noble can know *yue*,
discerning sound to know music,
discerning music to know governance,
discerning governance to approach ritual.

Zi Xia replied to Duke Wen of Wei:
*"The music of Zheng seduces and indulges the mind,
the music of Song lacks restraint and drowns the mind,
the music of Wei is repetitive and vexes the mind,
the music of Qi is arrogant and defiant.
These four harm virtue—
they are not proper music."*

In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*,
Yan Zi replied to Duke Jing of Qi:
*"The ancient kings blended the five flavors to harmonize the five tones,
to calm the heart,
to complete governance.
Music is like flavor."*

One: *qi* (breath), which stirs movement;
Two: *ti* (form), which embodies the dances of Wen and Wu;
Three: *lei* (category), which encompasses *feng*, *ya*, and *song*;
Four: *wu* (things), which uses the materials of the four directions to craft instruments.

The five tones: *gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zheng*, *yu*.
The six *lü*: *Huangzhong*, *Dadu*, *Guxi*, *Ruibin*, *Yizhi*, *Wushè*.
The six *lü*: *Jiangzhong*, *Linzhong*, *Zhonglü*, *Yingzhong*, *Nanlü*, *Dalu*.
*Lü* governs the yang,
*lü* governs the yin.

The seven tones were established by King Wu
when he conquered Zhou—
from *wu* (noon) to *zi* (midnight),
seven days were measured as seven tones.

The eight winds are the winds of the eight directions:
East: *Ming Shu*,
Southeast: *Qing Ming*,
South: *Ying Feng*,
Southwest: *Liang Feng*,
West: *Yanhé*,
North: *Guang Mo*,
Northwest: *Buzhou*,
Northeast: *Rong Feng*.

*Jiugong* is the song of the six ministries and three affairs,
the nine functions in song.
Clear and turbid, small and great,
short and long, swift and slow,
grief and joy, firm and yielding,
fast and slow, high and low,
entering and exiting, circulating—
these complement and assist one another.
The noble listens to them to calm the heart;
when the heart is calm, virtue harmonizes,
and only then does one approach the Dao.

Shun created the five-stringed *qin*,
and sang *"The South Wind"*;
Qiu first instituted music,
and bestowed it upon the feudal lords.

The method of governing the state
lies in knowing order and disorder through music,
thus the son of Duke Wu of Wu, Ji Zha,
listened to the ancient and modern music of the Three Dynasties,
and knew their rise and fall.

Those who cultivate themselves
observe in stillness and listen in silence,
listening to the unsounded—
only then can they speak of the Dao.

Before and after follow one another.
The distinction between before and after
arises from change and movement.
Without change or motion,
who comes first, who follows?
Once there is succession,
then before and after are divided.

Those of penetrating insight
erase and forget all distinctions—
the world’s laws only emphasize their differences.

*Touzu* refers to taking a step.
When a step is taken,
which comes first, which follows?

Those who are enlightened in this
are thus freed from the bounds of before and after.

Laozi, moved by pity for the common folk
wandering in confusion without return,
quarrelling over false passions,
forgetting the central Dao,
pointed out the Six Matters
to awaken the ignorant and the deluded.

For the central Dao is neither yin nor yang,
having no partial name.
It dwells between Heaven and Earth,
proud and unrestrained in its self-sojourning,
content with whatever it encounters—
free from all striving for gain or fame,
yet returning to the root of the Dao.
Even the differences between Yao and Jie,
the shifts of life and death,
the distinctions of right and wrong,
the disparities of long and short-lived,
the gulf between honor and disgrace,
the stirrings of sorrow and joy,
the succession of ancient and modern times—
all are forgotten by it.

To not know the differences between Yao and Jie
is to forget the distinction between good and evil.
To not know the shifts of life and death
is to forget the existence of anything.
To not know the distinctions of right and wrong
is to forget the difficulty of what is easy.
To not know the disparities of long and short-lived
is to forget the length and brevity of things.
To not know the gulf between honor and disgrace
is to forget high and low.
To not know the stirrings of sorrow and joy
is to forget sound and voice.
To not know the succession of ancient and modern times
is to forget before and after.

Dwelling in the realm of no "rightness,"
standing on the path of no "hurry,"
encountering it without resistance,
passing it without clinging,
adjusting to it with virtue,
aligning with it through the Dao—

Adding to it without conferring benefit,
subtracting from it without conferring harm—
these are the ones who have fully grasped the central Dao,
forgetting the distinctions of before and after,
forgetting the mechanisms of change.

Thus, the Sage attains the highest teaching.
For the Sage is one who aligns with Heaven and Earth in virtue,
with the sun and moon in luminosity,
with the Four Seasons in order,
with the spirits and gods in auspicious and inauspicious omens—
such is called the Sage.

Briefly speaking, there are five categories.
First, the Sage who attains the Dao: the Supreme Sage Laozi, the Great Sages of the heavens.
Second, the Sage who holds the position under Heaven and attains the virtue of immortality: Fu Xi, the Yellow Emperor, Zhuānxū, Shàohào, Yao, and Shun.
Third, the Sage who holds the position under Heaven but lacks the virtue of immortality: the Sages of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, Tang, and Wen and Wu of the Zhou.
All of them cleared the Six Extremes, yet they did not speak of ascending to Heaven.

Fourth, the Sage of broad and comprehensive virtue without the position under Heaven:
Zhougong and Confucius established rituals and music,
set examples for a hundred kings,
yet did not hold the Nine Five position,
yet all possessed the beauty of aligning with Heaven and Earth’s virtue.

Fifth, the Sage with singular excellence,
without the name of broad and comprehensive virtue,
nor possessing the virtues of the above categories:
the Sage of the *qín* (琴) is Boya and Shifu;
the Sage of chess is Ziqing and Suiming;
the Sage of discerning sound is Zhongqi and Yanzhou;
the Sage of singing is Han Ao and Qin Qing;
the Sage of wisdom is Gong Sun and Wen Zhi;
the Sage of vision and hearing is Lizhu and Shigong;
the Sage of calligraphy is Zhang Xu and Zhong Xuan.

In the scriptures, the "enlightened" refers to those who govern the world through principles.
The Sage who governs the world through principles
need only wear formal robes, maintain a respectful demeanor,
and face south—
that is all.

What then is this?
It is called dwelling in affairs of *wuwei* (無為).

To observe the beauty of Heaven and Earth,
to comprehend the principles of all things,
to follow the course of the Four Seasons—
when the ruler does *wuwei* above,
things transform spontaneously below.
This may be called practicing the teaching of *non-speech* (不言).

To govern the realm thus,
then the people find contentment in their dwellings,
joy in their customs,
and align with the Dao.

All things arise and act without complaint.
The Sage, regarding all things,
has them exist naturally since antiquity—
why should they await his doing before existing?
Things find their own way to life,
moving spontaneously, as in the words of the *Taixuan Jing* (《太玄经》):
*"Free to wander, free to delight."*

When the ruler above does *wuwei*,
those below naturally thrive,
thus there is leisure.

The "striking the earth" (擊壤) refers to earth, the soil.
As in the *Zhuangzi* (《庄子》□馬蹄篇):
*"In the time of Huixu, the people carried food in their mouths and played,
drummed their bellies and wandered."*

Those unaware of the Sovereign’s power—
as Wang Chong (*Lunheng* 《论衡》) says:
*"Emperor Yao ruled with boundless ease,
so nameless to the people.
An old man of fifty struck the earth by the roadside,
drummed his belly, and sang:
'We dig wells to drink,
till fields to eat,
rise with the sun, rest with the moon—
what power does the Sovereign hold over me?'
This is the common folk forgetting the Sage’s deeds."*

Born and yet not dwelling—
*not residing* (不居).

The Sage, in dwelling among things, is not harmed by them;
things fulfill their own nature.
When things fulfill their own nature,
the Sage does not claim their fruits but relies on their virtue—
trusting in Nature, abiding in perfect harmony.

Now, *function* (功) has different names:
The ruler’s *function* is called *merit* (勋),
as when the Duke of Zhou aided the King’s work.
The state’s *function* is called *achievement* (功),
as when Yi Yin preserved the nation.
The people’s *function* is called *service* (庸),
as when Hou Ji taught the laws of cultivation.
The laborer’s *function* is called *toil* (劳),
as when Yu of Xia stabilized the realm through exertion.
The administrator’s *function* is called *accomplishment* (绩),
as when Gou Sun established just ordinances.
The warrior’s *function* is called *victory* (多),
as when Han Xin triumphed with unconventional strategy.

Yet the *mysterious function* (玄功) is that which brings forth all things—
its depth and reach are profound, hence called *mysterious*.
When function is complete yet not claimed,
the Sage preserves the virtue of *wuwei*.

Day by day, he grows more cautious—
already explained in detail—
for the Sage’s deeds reach outward,
yet he does not boast, only fears failing his purpose,
lest his function collapse.
Thus he is ever vigilant, never at rest.

*Ning* (宁) means both *tranquility* and *diligence*.
The Sage’s *wuwei* is vast in its function,
things fulfill their nature without loss,
the heavens clear above, the earth settled below,
the Four Seas unified in peace—
serene and at rest—
this is called *Great Peace*.

Now, *only* (夫惟) is the opening phrase—
meaning the Sage does not depart from non-possession.
The Sage’s influence extends to the Four Seas, yet he does not claim it;
his benevolence covers all things, yet he does not call it favor;
his function shapes the world, yet he does not take it as his own;
his virtue surpasses the Four Seasons, yet he does not rule as master.
He forgets himself in the Dao,
harmonizes his will with the Void,
dwelling above yet not making others feel his weight,
dwelling before yet not harming them,
the world willingly follows, yet none grow weary—
thus his resolve does not waver.

The ruler who does not err in joy or anger
avoids excessive punishments and rewards,
and war does not arise.

Who does not err in seeking and taking
avoids heavy taxation and burdensome provisions.

Who does not err in love or hatred
ensures proper appointments and distinguishes the worthy from the unworthy.

Who does not err in choosing attendants
makes all around him upright.

Who does not err in governing lands
keeps arms idle and soldiers unlabored.

Who does not err in treating the people
brings peace to the world.

Things find their proper place,
not relying on function,
*wuwei* without seeking its benefits—
truly vast and profound!

*"Thick and straight as hair"*—words from the *Shijing* (《诗□小雅□都人士篇》),
speaking of emotions sincere and conduct upright,
like the root and tip of a hair—
no excess, no deficiency.

The Dao of the ruler says:
*"When all know beauty as beauty, then ugliness arises.
The Dao has no differing forms—who decides what is good or evil?
Nature is inherently unified—who judges right or wrong?
Where there is beauty, there is its opposite, ugliness.
Thus, when all know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises.
Where there is goodness, there is its opposite, ungoodness.
Thus, when all know goodness as goodness, ungoodness arises.
What the world now admires as divine and strange,
it once despised as foul and rotten.
Divine and strange may transform into foul and rotten,
foul and rotten may transform into divine and strange—
then how can beauty and ugliness be distinguished?
What was once right may later be wrong.
What is now discarded may later be used."*

Then how can goodness and ungoodness be chosen?

The Sage embodies the True One—ever present yet ever absent,
manifesting wondrous use yet ever without—
beauty and ugliness, goodness and ungoodness,
are all but simplified away—
how then could evil and ungoodness ever burden?

Thus, the interplay of *having* and *non-having* unfolds,
forever preceding and following.
Before the *Tàiyī* was differentiated, all phenomena shared one body.
Once the Two Forces emerged, each thing found its opposite.

These six pairs—
where myriad transformations intersect,
where myriad thoughts arise,
where divergent paths begin—
are the snares by which the world is ensnared, unable to escape.

Without motion, there is *having*;
*having* returns to *non-having*—
thus, the interplay of *having* and *non-having*.
Where there is peril in crossing,
one knows the ease of traversing—
thus, the interplay of difficulty and ease,
of length and shortness—
as with inches and spans.
High and low take form in contrast—
as with mountains and marshes.
Sound rises, echo responds—
thus, the harmony of sound and voice.
Form moves, shadow follows—
thus, the succession of before and after.

The movement of yin and yang,
the progression of the four seasons,
the principles of all things—
suddenly formed, then suddenly vanished.
Its difficulty is like deliberate action governing the world;
its ease is like effortless alignment with nature.

What is long is not to be severed,
what is short is not to be extended—
heaven naturally ascends, earth naturally descends.
Strike the *gōng* and the *gōng* resonates;
strike the *jué* and the *jué* responds.
Spring comes first, summer follows;
the elder precedes, the younger follows.

Though these paired realms all rest within the Dao,
they are far from the Dao itself.

Thus, the Sage’s supreme teaching:
to act in *wuwei*, as *Zhuangzi* said—
*"to govern the world without action."*
To practice speechless instruction, as the *Yijing* taught—
*"to set the divine Way as teaching, and the world submits."*

To act is to risk failure;
to speak is to risk error—
how could this ever be free from entanglement?
How could this be the Sage’s way of standing above all things,
transforming all things without being burdened by them?

All things arise, yet the Sage does not decline or withdraw.
All things act in concert, responding as sensed—
like a mirror reflecting form, revealing beauty and ugliness alike;
like a valley echoing sound, revealing goodness and evil alike—
without refusal.

Thus, *"all things arise, yet the Sage does not decline."*
They self-generate, self-transform,
self-form, self-color,
each reaching their utmost height and fulfilling their nature—
who could claim ownership?
Thus, *"to give birth yet not possess."*

To harmonize all things yet seek no gain,
to benefit ten thousand generations yet claim no transformation,
to encompass heaven and earth, to carve all forms yet claim no craft—
thus, *"to act yet not rely."*

The seasons turn, and the effective departs—
this is the Way of Heaven.
The Sage embodies it,
so achievements cover the world yet seem not of oneself—
to claim them would only be self-deception.
Thus, *"when success is achieved, do not dwell upon it."*
Dwelling invites departure—
as past and present attest.
To dwell within oneself is to remain unshaken;
to follow the coming is natural,
to follow the going is natural—
what harm or gain is there?
Thus, *"only by not dwelling does one not depart."*

Wang Anshi said:
*"When all know beauty as beauty, then ugliness arises."*
Beauty is the opposite of ugliness,
goodness the opposite of ungoodness—
this is the constant principle of things.
Only the Sage stands without opposition to all things.
What is not the Sage’s doing all has opposites.
Thus, the interplay of *having* and *non-having* unfolds,
forever preceding and following.

*Having* and *non-having*,
difficulty and ease,
length and shortness,
high and low,
sound and voice,
before and after—
all inevitably have their opposites.
Only by transcending these six pairs
can one enter the divine—
and entering the divine, one stands without opposition between heaven and earth.

*The Zìshuō* says:
*"Wu* from *dà*, *lín* from *wáng*—
the ultimate of *having* is to return to *non-having*.*
Laozi said:
*"The interplay of having and non-having."*

Thus, the Sage’s supreme teaching:
The Sage, observing that *having* has opposites,
therefore acts in *wuwei* and teaches without speech.
The Sage never fails to act—
yet action arises from *wuwei*.
The Sage never fails to speak—
yet speech arises from *non-speech*.

From *"giving birth yet not possessing"* to *"achieving success yet not dwelling"*—
to give birth yet not claim its birth,
to act yet not rely on the act,
to achieve success yet not dwell upon it—
these three arise from *wu-wǒ* (no-self).

Only by *wu-wǒ* does one not lose oneself.
Not only does one not lose oneself,
but one also does not lose others.
To fail to know *wu-wǒ* and instead dwell in *yǒu-wǒ* (self),
is not only to lose oneself—
but also to lose others.

To dwell upon success is to invite departure;
dwelling and departure are opposites.
The Sage’s three non-dwellings—
only then does the Dao abide within oneself,
and not depart.

Su Yán said:
*"When all know beauty as beauty, then ugliness arises."*
The world judges beauty and ugliness by form and name.
What they call beautiful and good—
is it truly beautiful and good?
They do not know the interplay of *having* and *non-having*,
difficulty and ease, length and shortness, high and low,
sound and voice, before and after—
all these are not their true nature.

Just as one assumes length, yet a longer one surpasses—
then one is short.
Just as one assumes precedence, yet a prior one comes—
then one is last.
If one follows what is deemed beautiful and believes it,
one strays far from the truth.

Thus, the Sage’s supreme teaching:
When acting, hold the heart of *wuwei*;
when teaching, hold the intent of *non-speech*—
thus, transcending measures of length and shortness,
free from ranks of before and after,
neither beautiful nor ugly,
neither good nor ungood—
how could the world ever comprehend?

From *"all things arise"* to *"not dwelling"*—
all things act for me, yet I decline none;
I give birth to them, yet never claim or rely—
even in success, I never dwell upon it—
this is the teaching of *wuwei* and *non-speech*,
its beauty and goodness beyond measure.

No evil or ungoodness could follow it—
for the Sage’s ultimate teaching is *not departing*.

The Sage dwells in poverty and lowliness yet knows no worry of poverty or lowliness;
dwells in wealth and honor yet bears no burden of wealth and honor—
this is called *not dwelling*.

If I do not dwell, how could others depart?
This is the ultimate of *dwelling*.

Lu Jiufu said:
All under heaven know that the ultimate is not ungood.
All under heaven know beauty as beauty, goodness as goodness,
yet desire to know evil and ungoodness to hate them—
yet when speaking of the Dao itself,
even beauty and goodness depart from the Dao.
When speaking of the Dao’s emergence,
even evil and ungoodness are not outside it.
Thus observed, beauty becomes evil, goodness becomes ungood—
is this not true?

Hence, *having* and *non-having* generate and follow one another.
Things under heaven arise from *having*, *having* from *non-having*—
this is called the generation of *having* and *non-having*.
Difficult things arise from ease, yet ease arises from difficulty—
without difficulty, there would be no ease—
this is called the completion of difficult and easy.
The crane’s long legs reveal the hare’s short;
the duck’s short legs reveal the crane’s long—
this is called the contrast of long and short.
If high is taken as true, then all valleys are the source of rivers—
then high would tilt toward the low.
If low is taken as true, then rivers are the confluence of valleys—
then low would tilt toward the high.
This is called the mutual incline of high and low.
If the yellow bell is master, the other bells harmonize;
if the other bells are master, the yellow bell harmonizes—
this is called the mutual resonance of sounds.
From autumn and winter, spring and summer appear prior;
from spring and summer, autumn and winter appear prior—
this is called the succession of before and after.
Thus, the Sage’s ultimate teaching:
The Sage acts in *wuwei*, yet *wuwei* means no action—
no action, no mind; the Sage’s mind is the people’s mind.
He teaches through *non-speech*, yet *non-speech* means no words—
no words, yet words emerge from *non-speech*.
Though deeds leave no trace of doing,
though teaching reveals no intent of speech,
yet affairs are accomplished, and teaching takes root.
All things act, yet he declines none—
his virtue is ultimate, without the burden of success.
He would make people return to simplicity, become companions of Heaven and Earth,
friends of Creation and Transformation.
For the ultimate is *not departing*.

*Not departing* is the opposite of departing—
this Dao abides within me, how could it ever shift?

Lu Nongshi said:
All under heaven know that the ultimate is not ungood.
When beauty reaches *non-beauty*, that is true beauty under heaven.
When goodness reaches *non-goodness*, that is true goodness under heaven.
True beauty departs, yet all under heaven know beauty as beauty.
True goodness disperses, yet all under heaven know goodness as goodness.
Hence, *having* and *non-having* generate and follow one another.
*Having* and *non-having* speak of the Dao’s essence,
difficult and easy speak of its virtue,
long and short speak of its form,
high and low speak of its position,
sounds speak of mutual resonance,
before and after speak of beginning and end—
this is the natural order.
Thus, the Sage’s ultimate teaching:
The Sage acts in *wuwei*, teaches through *non-speech*,
to make people merge with true goodness, blend with true beauty,
return to simplicity, and become companions of Heaven and Earth,
friends of Creation and Transformation.
All things act, yet he declines none—
he does not depart.
All things exhale, and he follows them inward without resistance;
all things arise, and he follows them outward without refusal.

Wang Yuanzai said:
All under heaven know that the ultimate is not ungood.
The Dao is originally without things;
things have delusive emotions, self-differentiating—
this is drowning in the flow of transformation, unable to emerge.
Yet those who drown do not emerge because they do not weary of attachment
but instead cling to delight—
thus they hate ungoodness.
Hence, evil and ungoodness follow beauty and goodness.
When beauty and goodness arise, they are already evil and ungood.
Waiting for their reversal to awaken is already late.
Still, the Perfect One says beauty and goodness have not departed from evil and ungoodness,
nor have evil and ungoodness departed from beauty and goodness.
The foolish under heaven cannot comprehend this.
Thus, beauty and goodness are always evil and ungood.

*The New Saying* states:
This speaks of those who blindly follow beauty and goodness,
preferring evil and ungoodness to beauty and goodness.
Only the Sage, detached and far-seeing, knows
that beauty contains evil, goodness contains ungoodness—
never drowning in them.

Hence, *having* and *non-having* generate and follow one another.
To separate from the Dao is to create *self*—
*self* creates *other*.
Once *self* and *other* divide, duality arises in all things.
This is why emotions, life and death, and transformations
emerge and recede without end—
all failing to grasp the root of yin and yang,
instead following superficial distinctions,
fixating on one while abandoning the rest,
taking delusion as truth.

This second section resembles *Zhuangzi’s "Equating Things"* in structure,
with a sequential argument that can be logically traced.
Thus, the Sage’s ultimate teaching:
The Sage’s mind is the people’s mind—
though he acts, he never advances his own doing;
though he teaches, he never reveals his intent of speech.
Yet affairs are accomplished, teaching takes root,
while I remain still, never burdened by words,
and all under heaven thus return to simplicity.

Only without burden could one,
though lodged between yin and yang,
resist the sway of Creation and Transformation.

The six pairs—how could they disturb him?
Ten thousand things arise without refusal.
When all things arise together,
the Sage exhausts their nature without hesitation,
for my mind is still—
without grasping or rejecting.

If one harbors thoughts of grasping or rejecting,
then the myriad forms of things—beautiful or ugly—are endless.
How could one refuse them?

Born yet never dwelling.
To dwell is to perish.
Only the utterly non-dwelling endures.
Once form and name descend,
all undergo transformation and decay—
yet the Dao has no substance,
and nothing can displace it.
The Sage embodies the Dao,
thus filling all without boundary,
yet never possessing anything;
responding to ten thousand changes,
yet never harboring intent.

Then how could one cling to transient affairs,
fixating on them as achievement?
Only then does one transcend the realm of the six pairs,
sever the names of beauty and ugliness,
and dwell in the eternal law beyond birth and death.

Holding this mind to traverse the world,
even if fame and achievement are lofty,
how could there be the burden of arrogance?

Liu Zhongping said:
When all under heaven know that the utmost ugliness is ugliness,
then ugliness cannot persist—
it becomes beauty instead.
When all under heaven know that the utmost goodness is goodness,
then goodness cannot persist—
it becomes non-goodness instead.

Thus, the Sage’s ultimate teaching:
Only the solitary one dwells in the affairs of non-action,
practicing the teaching of non-speech,
so that all under heaven do not know of my goodness or beauty.
This is how the Dao teaches without departing—
for it is utterly non-departing.
For it is utterly non-dwelling,
thus non-departing is achieved—
this is why it is called non-dwelling.
Non-dwelling means standing independently
amidst the six pairs.

The people are in ignorance,
already swept along by the six pairs.
If one cuts off and departs from these six,
and does not respond with deeds or teachings,
then what reliance do the people have?
Only by not dwelling on achievement
does one, though not departing,
save them greatly.

Zhuangzi said: *"Follow ten thousand things without departing."*

Liu Jujie said:
When all under heaven know that the utmost ugliness is ugliness,
then wondrous names arise, and beauty and goodness emerge.
When false names arise, ugliness and non-goodness emerge.
When the name of beauty arises, ugliness emerges.
When the name of goodness arises, non-goodness emerges—
all are deviations from the Dao.
Though the natures of good and evil may arise,
their names and words have no end.
The vulgar cannot know this,
yet they know what they favor,
and call it beautiful—
while ugliness follows.
They call it good—
while non-goodness follows.

The Sage, though unable to sever good and evil,
cannot stand apart from them either.
Yet he can turn beauty into ugliness,
and goodness into non-goodness,
or turn ugliness into beauty,
and non-goodness into goodness.

Zhuangzi said:
*"What is deemed wondrous becomes foul decay,
what is deemed foul decay becomes wondrous—
foul decay and wondrousness cyclically transform."*

Thus, being and non-being generate and follow one another.
He who gains a deer may lose it immediately;
he who loses a horse may gain it again.
Gain and loss have no fixed end—
this is the pattern of generation.
Water cannot be a carriage,
land cannot be a boat—
skill and clumsiness have no fixed end—
this is the pattern of mutual completion.
The mycelium and the morning mushroom—
longevity and early death have no fixed end—
this is the pattern of contrast.
Kings and beggars—
nobility and lowliness have no fixed end—
this is the pattern of inversion.
One dreams of drinking wine,
then wakes to weeping—
sorrow and joy have no fixed end—
this is the pattern of harmony.
Infancy, youth, old age, and death—
life and death have no fixed end—
this is the pattern of succession.

These six pairs,
all arise from the naming of good and evil—
speaking of what has no ultimate end.

Only when one awakens in the depths of obscurity
can one know this,
and knowing it, harmonize with it.

Thus, the Sage’s ultimate teaching:
Once good and evil are distinguished,
the six pairs emerge.
For the people, it is better to remain ignorant—
then their nobility is profound.
Those who share the people’s afflictions
thus engage in affairs.
And there are teachings—
those far away are served without action,
which is the affair of non-action.
Those nearby are taught with speech,
which is the teaching of non-goodness.
Affairs and teachings exist
only to rescue the vulgar,
yet they return to the same flow,
and are swept along by the six pairs—
how then can they be considered noble?

Zhuangzi said:
*"The utmost speech is beyond speech,
the utmost action is beyond action.*
Ten thousand things arise without refusal—
this expounds the meaning of non-speech,
committing ten thousand things to self-creation,
yet unable to explain them,
hence ‘arise without refusal.’
Once they arise, they are born;
once born, teaching takes root—
this is why it is called ‘born yet not possessed.’
Those who attribute speech to words
are those who cannot help but exhaust their mouths.

Only the utterly non-departing—
acting yet not relying,
achieving yet not dwelling—
this expounds how non-action leads to accomplishment.
When there is action, achievement follows;
when there is achievement, dwelling follows.
If one attends to action beforehand,
then dwelling comes afterward."

Liu Ji said:
When all under heaven know that beauty is beauty,
then non-departing is achieved.
Before differentiation, all things were one body.
Once the two *qi* divide,
things form opposing pairs.
Once called beautiful,
then purity is lost—
evil must oppose it.
Once called good,
then nature is severed—
non-goodness must oppose it.
Beauty may become ugliness,
goodness may become non-goodness—
just as being and non-being generate,
difficulty and ease complete,
long and short contrast,
high and low invert,
sounds harmonize,
before and after succeed—
these six pairs may affirm or negate,
reverse or persist,
and are not the ultimate rectitude of all under heaven.

What was once right may later be wrong,
what was once discarded may later be used.

Is this not like beauty being called beauty, goodness being called good—
yet their nature remains undetermined?

The *Classics* say:
*"The right may become the strange,
the good may become the ominous."*
This is indeed so.

Moreover, the principles of all under heaven:
Where there is action, there is gain and loss;
where there is speech, there is right and error—
none are free from entanglement.

Thus, the Sage engages in *wuwei* (non-action),
conducts *buyan* (non-teaching).
Through this, he transcends things and people,
standing alone above all things,
not opposing things—
and thus nothing can pair with him.
This is what *Liezi* called *"doubtful solitude,"*
what *Zhuangzi* called *"the singular possession."*

In *wuwei*, the utmost is to abandon action,
yet in the silent depths, clarity is alone revealed;
in *buyan*, the utmost is to abandon speech,
yet in the soundless void, harmony is alone heard.

The Sage embodies the Dao within himself—
his mind labors not,
his response to things is without measure.
All things come to him endlessly, never exhausted,
so when all things act in concert,
responding as they are sensed,
he acts with them without reluctance,
allows all things to generate themselves without claiming their generation,
allows all things to be themselves without relying on their being.
His achievements cover all under heaven,
yet it seems not his own doing;
his transformation benefits all things,
yet the people do not depend on him.

Thus, when achievements are complete, he does not dwell upon them—
if he dwells, then he must depart.
Therefore, only by not dwelling does he not depart.
When achievements are complete yet he does not claim them,
is this not because he does not wish to be seen as virtuous?
Thus, he follows this with *"not extolling the virtuous."*

Zhao Shiyuan remarked:
*"The opening sequence explains the six pairs.*
*First, it declares the non-essential nature of the right.*
*When all under heaven know this, they recognize that evil has already arisen.*

*The Dao De Jing’s discourse on virtue and power*
*is most profound in its opening chapter.*
*From the ever-non-existent to the ever-existent,*
*within the vague and indistinct, form emerges,*
*unifying all things in one thread.*
*Again, from the mysterious to the yet more mysterious,*
*the meaning of gradual and sudden transformation is fully exhausted here.*

*Yet the eighty-one chapters’ principles are interconnected,*
*their meanings all having their threads.*
*Once things depart from the subtle gate,*
*the ever-Dao and ever-name merge*
*in the realm of beauty and evil.*
*Thus, it follows with the passage:*
*'When all under heaven know...'*

*The Dao descending as things,*
*the ever-present is the body of the Dao.*
*The body is what fulfills all uses—*
*how could its use remain fixed in the ever-present?*
*Thus, following the nature of things, there must be change,*
*and within things, there must be variation.*
*The ever-present cannot remain ever-present,*
*beauty cannot remain ever-beautiful—*
*as emotions shift and do not align,*
*good and evil become opposites.*

*The *Shijing* says:*
*'The gentle autumn wind blows,
bringing shade and rain.
Plucking *bo* and *fei*,*
*do not harm their roots.'*
*It speaks of how*
*the emotions of heaven and earth cannot always be harmonious,*
*the natures of all things cannot always be good.*

*Beauty and evil are neither the Dao nor nature—*
*they arise from established perceptions.*
*All established perceptions stem from desire;*
*the heart of desire knows only that beauty is beauty,*
*yet does not know that beauty may reverse into evil,*
*that goodness may reverse into non-goodness.*

*This is how the ever-Dao and ever-name*
*flow into affairs—*
*thus, it is said: "Affairs follow the Dao."*

*From this chapter,*
*beginning with the reversal of good and evil,*
*to the six pairs not being uniform,*
*first citing affairs to reveal principles,*
*then abandoning entanglements to return to truth.*

*The saying "revealing principles through affairs"*
*refers to how the six pairs—*
*beauty, evil, goodness, non-goodness—*
*not being uniform are all matters of affairs.*
*When the Sage engages in *wuwei*,*
*he perceives principles through affairs,*
*enters awareness through dust—*
*who but the Sage could grasp this principle?*

*The Sage, with singular insight, illuminates all,*
*transcending all forms above,*
*leaving the realm of flux,*
*dwelling in the domain of *wuwei*.*
*What things of all under heaven could entangle him?*
*This is abandoning entanglements to return to truth.*

*If there is nothing, then there is *wuwei*—*
*only *wuwei* exists.*
*If there is something, then affairs arise,*
*affairs arise from the something.*
*The Sage would not fearfully establish himself*
*in the realm of non-affairs.*
*He simply adapts to changes and governs accordingly.*

*At this point in the text, the discussion shifts to governance.*
*All discourse on governance*
*must encompass internal teachings,*
*then clarify the principles of governance.*
*Thus, though Confucian scholars may criticize*
*"Nashisutong"* (the room’s teachings),
*it belongs uniquely to the Sage.*
*The text first displays the affairs of beauty and evil,*
*then cites the six pairs to clarify their causes.*

*Second, the realm of opposition.*
*Thus, the non-existent and existent generate each other,*
*difficulty and ease complete each other.*
*The word *zhe* (this) echoes the earlier text,*
*after lamenting the reversals of beauty, evil, goodness, and non-goodness,*
*it now marks the six as opposites in the logic of non-existence and existence.*

*Difficulty and ease are matters of affairs,*
*long and short are matters of talent,*
*high and low are matters of position,*
*sounds are matters of pitch and harmony,*
*before and after are matters of new and old.*

*All things emerge from the mechanism and return to the mechanism,*
*a hundred transformations arise from soil and return to soil.*
*Emerging from the mechanism and returning to it—*
*from the ultimate non-existent, they receive their mandate,*
*and when they return, they return to the non-existent.*
*This is speaking of nature.*

*A hundred transformations arise from soil,*
*from the formed to the formless,*
*born of things, yet transforming back into soil—*
*they never depart from the existent.*
*This is speaking of form.*

*Truly, the existent and non-existent share the same origin in the Dao’s nature—*
*emerging, they become existent;*
*returning, they become non-existent.*
*Just as spring and summer come first,*
*autumn and winter follow—*
*beginning and ending complete each other,*
*alternately hidden, alternately revealed,*
*the primary meaning within the realm of opposition.*

*Thus, it is said:*
*"The non-existent and existent generate each other—*
*this is principle.*
*Difficulty and ease complete each other—*
*affairs have no ease; accumulated difficulty becomes ease.*
*Affairs have no difficulty; accumulated ease becomes difficulty.*

*Founding a venture is difficult,*
*preserving it is easy.*
*Comparing founding to preserving,*
*though founding is difficult,*
*its reversal becomes easy—*
*how is this made clear?*
*By the righteous overthrowing the unrighteous,*
*as the hungry are easily fed,*
*the thirsty are easily quenched—*
*like Tang and Wu consoling the people and punishing crimes."*

The Way’s nature—when manifest, it is existence;
when withdrawn, it is non-existence.
As spring and summer precede,
autumn and winter follow—
beginning and ending complete each other,
alternately hidden, alternately revealed,
the primary meaning within the realm of opposition.

Thus, it is said:
*"The non-existent and existent generate each other—*
*this is principle.*
*Difficulty and ease complete each other—*
*affairs have no ease; accumulated difficulty becomes ease.*
*Affairs have no difficulty; accumulated ease becomes difficulty.*

*Founding a venture is difficult,*
*preserving it is easy.*
*Comparing founding to preserving,*
*though founding is difficult,*
*its reversal becomes easy—*
*how is this made clear?*
*By the righteous overthrowing the unrighteous,*
*as the hungry are easily fed,*
*the thirsty are easily quenched—*
*like Tang and Wu consoling the people and punishing crimes."*

Now, comparing preserving to founding,
preserving is easy,
yet its reversal becomes difficult—
how is this made clear?
A ruler who preserves like one holding a full vessel
must keep his heart settled and his will balanced,
lest he not remain still and composed—
movement brings collapse.
This is called failing to settle the heart and balance the will,
and thus it becomes difficult.

Therefore, no ruler who preserves compares to King Cheng.
If knowledge is easy, there is affection;
if obedience is easy, there is merit.
Though only ease is spoken of and not difficulty,
those who can achieve ease hold difficulty within.
The world’s affairs—who does not follow this?
To make difficult what is easy brings ease,
to make easy what is difficult brings difficulty.
Thus it is said: *"Difficulty and ease complete each other."*

This matter also concerns
the contrast of long and short.
All things born between heaven and earth
share the same vital *qi*.
Those who receive the fullness of *qi* grow long,
those who receive its weakness grow short.
Thus ancient people often reached seven *chi* in height,
while today’s people rarely exceed five.
Ancient people were tall and majestic—
the full descent of *qi*;
today’s people are short and frail—
the gradual weakening of *qi*.
Is this merely the change of affairs?
Humans are the same.
Though some vary, none can remain entirely pure.
Thus, the forms of heaven and humanity have fixed measures,
and their contrasts serve appropriate uses.
Materials fit the hands of a master craftsman,
each suited to its purpose;
talents are placed under the selection of the Sage,
each fulfilling its virtue.

What is naturally long cannot be shortened—
the crane’s legs are proof;
what is naturally short cannot be extended—
the duck’s legs are proof.
Thus, the long cannot be shortened—
to do so brings sorrow;
the short cannot be lengthened—
to do so brings worry.
This is the natural order.
Yet in human nature, there is neither long nor short—
only equality.
But in the things of humanity,
they are certainly not uniform.
The *Transmission* says: *"The tortoise is longer than the snake,"*
not speaking of form but of principle.
*"Yin is deficient to yang,"*
not speaking of *qi* but of virtue.
There are those like the bones of the *Fangfeng* people,
who could span a chariot,
and the people of *Xingyuan*, who were only a *chi* and a half tall—
how unequal they are!
Though an inch is short and a *chi* is long,
without the inch, the *chi* cannot be complete;
though a beam is tall and a rafter is short,
without the rafter, the beam cannot stand firm.
This is the meaning of contrast—
this is certainly speaking of materials.

The contrast of high and low:
Heaven is high, earth is low,
yang ascends, yin descends,
mountains rise, marshes sink—
high and low are matters of position and force.
The higher the position, the higher the force must be;
the lower the position, the lower the force must be.
Yet heaven covers below, earth supports above—
the two do not topple each other.
Yang is above, yin is below—
the two do not topple each other.
Only mountains rising and marshes sinking create a contrast—
mountains rise, marshes sink,
and if we speak of water, we say:
*"A hundred valleys are the source of rivers and streams,"*
then high things descend to the low.
If we take this as true,
then rivers and streams are the gathering of the valleys.
Again, speaking of the contrast of forces,
high banks become valleys,
deep valleys become hills—
this is the principle of contrast.
How so?
Banks are high.
When banks are hollowed, they become valleys;
valleys are depressions.
Depressions sink and then level out,
level ground rises and becomes hills.
Who knows that after a thousand years,
hills will not become banks,
or banks will not become depressions?
Contrast is always a matter of force.

The harmony of sounds—this is music.
Ritual guides the mind,
music guides harmony.
After the simplicity of antiquity dispersed,
people lost their natural emotions.
Without ritual to regulate them, they become disordered;
without music to harmonize them, they are injured.
Thus, the rise of music is the creation of sounds.
The *Record of Music* says:
*"All sounds arise from the human heart.
The heart’s movement is caused by things.
When moved by things, it manifests in sound.
Sounds respond to each other and thus create variation;
when variation is complete, it is called music.
Comparing sounds to create music,
and using drums, spears, feathers, and flags—this is music.
Music is the origin of sound,
its root in the heart’s response to things.
Thus, when the sorrowful heart is moved,
its sound is sharp and severe;
when the joyful heart is moved,
its sound is slow and relaxed;
when the joyful heart is moved,
its sound bursts forth and scatters;
when the angry heart is moved,
its sound is coarse and fierce;
when the respectful heart is moved,
its sound is straight and restrained;
when the worried heart is moved,
its sound is harmonious and gentle.
These six are not innate;
they arise only when moved by things.
Thus, the ancient kings were cautious about what moved them,
so they used ritual to guide their wills,
music to harmonize their sounds,
government to unify their actions,
and law to prevent their deceit.
Ritual, music, law, and governance—
these are one in purpose.
They serve to unify the people’s hearts
and establish the path of governance.

All sounds arise from the human heart.
Emotions move within,
and thus manifest in sound.
When sound forms patterns, it is called music.
Thus, in a well-ordered age, music is peaceful and joyful,
and its governance is harmonious.
In a chaotic age, music is resentful and angry,
and its governance is misaligned.
In a fallen kingdom, music is sorrowful and reflective,
and its people are suffering.
The way of sound is linked to governance.

*Gong* is the ruler,
*Shang* is the minister,
*Jiao* is the people,
*Zheng* is affairs,
*Yu* is things.
If these five are not disordered,
there will be no discordant sounds.
The *Lü* and *Yu* correspond to the twelve months.
The five tones arise from the five phases,
the five phases correspond to the five viscera.
The liver governs anger,
the lungs govern sorrow,
the spleen governs thought,
the heart governs joy,
the kidneys govern fear.
Since the five viscera govern differently,
the five tones, when resonating, also differ.
To summon joy with joy,
its sound is also joyful.
To summon sorrow with sorrow,
its sound is also sorrowful.
Inner responses meet outer echoes—
this is the harmony of emotions and sounds.

The sounds and tones are spoken through *lǚ* and *lǘ*.
The past and future follow one another.
The sun’s passage does not return to a former day—
the moon’s course governs it.
The year’s passage does not return to a former year—
the seasons govern it.
The shifting of illusions does not return to former illusions—
the body marks it.
The present’s departure does not return to former presents—
time transmits it.

Turning back to view it,
ancient and present stand revealed.
Spring and summer precede autumn and winter—
the four seasons flow without pause,
new replacing old, old returning as new,
cycling endlessly, past and future chasing,
fortune and calamity leaning upon each other without error,
form and shadow consoling each other without separation.
This is the principle of past and future,
spoken of in terms of new and old.

Observe how existence and nonexistence generate each other—
the transformation of things.
If identical, it is emptiness;
emptiness, then, is vast—
what more is there to appear or vanish?

Difficulty and ease complement each other.
To grasp and fill is not as good as leaving it be—
what more is there to fear or grieve?

Length and shortness define each other.
Their forms are not uniform—
the formless cannot be exhausted by numbers.
Which is uniform, which is not?

High and low incline toward each other.
The exalted is *Huang*, the lowly is *Wang*—
both attain the Dao’s place,
one and undivided—
no thing can displace it.
Which inclines, which does not?

For the harmony of sounds and tones,
is it not like the great sound that lacks voice,
which hearing cannot penetrate?
For the past and future following one another,
is it not like resting in shadow while the light advances,
which progress cannot distinguish?

If not one who embodies the Dao and stands above all things,
who can partake in this?

Thus, the sage knows:
no thing can truly bind the *Wuji*.
Next, depart from suffering and uphold the True.

**First, reflect with constancy.**
Therefore, the sage dwells in non-action.
Thus, the written characters arise in sequence—
earlier words spoke of the six opposing pairs being unaligned,
here dividing the meaning into two gates.

One: things are unaligned, the six pairs persist.
Two: things in mutual dependence find harmony,
yet through their unalignment, they achieve alignment—
this is *having-for* (action).
To harmonize through mutual dependence is rigidity.
Amid unaligned dependence, to stand alone and self-possessed—
this is the sage.
The sage is one who fulfills their nature.
To fulfill one’s nature,
talent and Dao merge.
Unable to fulfill one’s nature,
one may have the sage’s talent but lack the sage’s Dao.
With talent but no Dao, one is clever—
cleverness is artificial.
With Dao but no talent, one is plain—
plainness does not transform.
Only when talent and Dao merge is it called *complete virtue*.
To adapt to time and respond to change,
to change without exhaustion,
then one can illuminate the Dao of non-action.
To illuminate the Dao of non-action,
to skillfully dwell in non-action;
to skillfully dwell in non-action,
to practice the teaching of *wu yan* (non-speech).

All who dwell within the cosmos
cannot escape affairs,
those in the highest positions
cannot avoid exertion of the mind.
For if mind and affairs run parallel,
the principle of non-action is lost.
If body and affairs are distant,
the ability to dwell well is lost.
The sage, seated in one hall,
supplies all demands—
how could the body be distant from affairs?
It must be: *empty the mind and respond to change*.

Though the six pairs come from without,
by principle, they are fixed within the heart.
For the heart gives rise to emotions,
affairs align with emotions;
when affairs align with emotions,
the realm of mutual dependence becomes tangled and confused,
without pause.
This is not knowing their fixed nature,
leaving it to unfold naturally.
Things have their inherent nature—
we follow and govern accordingly.
Things have their unspoken principles—
we remain silent and respond in kind,
this is what is called *knowing without action, seeing without clarity*.

Heaven, through non-action, attains clarity—
the principle of rewarding virtue and punishing licentiousness is manifest.
Earth, through non-action, attains tranquility—
the sentiment of following Heaven’s law is established.
Thus observed,
Heaven and Earth—do they have no affairs?
To dwell in non-action is all.

**Second, transform things with sincerity.**
Practice the teaching of *wu yan*.
The teaching of *wu yan* is how the sage transforms the world with sincerity.
To transform things with sincerity is to observe and transform.
The superior transforms the inferior,
like wind passing over the earth—
what need for speech?
Zhuangzi said: *Two non-actions merge*—this is it.
*The Classic of Changes* says: *The sage teaches through the divine method.*
When transformation reaches the divine,
it is swift without haste, effective without action—
as Mencius said: *Sagehood beyond knowing is called divine.*
Moreover, correctness is singular and stops there—
all my correct things are corrected.
Thus it is said: *When the self is correct, orders need not be given for them to be followed;
when the self is incorrect, even orders will not be obeyed.*
These are all teachings of *wu yan*.

Yet even so, to transform things with sincerity,
to lead by example—
these are the affairs of governing the world.
As for those who call it teaching without virtue,
they still bear the intent of earnest instruction—
perhaps those who do not know *why it is so* are simply following nature.
Who but the sage can speak of this?

Thus, foresight cannot be observed—
the poem warning the Duke of Nan warns *Guo Gong*:
*"Silk robes and fox-fur garments,
complexion like polished cinnabar—
this is your lord!"*

**Third, the flow of measure is inexhaustible.**
All things act yet do not decline.
Earlier words spoke of the six opposing pairs being unaligned—
the sage, with singular insight, awakens,
shatters illusion, and returns to the True,
dwelling in the realm of non-action,
seated amidst the bustle of the world.
Next, it is said: *All things act yet do not decline*—
this reveals the Dao’s function.

What is this revealed function?
Non-action is non-movement.
Now, all things act—
from where do they come?
Still, they arise from the non.
Though it is said that what is born is born of itself,
what transforms transforms of itself—
the Dao never takes charge—
how then can it be said *not to decline*?

**Yet it is said that there is no refusal—**
then the coming is never rejected.

Thus, it must be that all things are truly born from the Dao,
and the sage governs them—
does this not mean they come to him?

What concerns me, I must know.
In the discussion of *quan* (权) and *shi* (实)—
all things are *quan* (transient/phenomenal),
the sage is *shi* (substantial/true).
The true does not shift,
the transient reveals it—
so then, the world belongs to the sage.

The sage has never possessed the world,
yet his vast heart accommodates it all,
content and at ease.
Empty yet illuminating,
ever-responsive yet ever-serene—
how then can there be refusal?

**Fourth, transformation arises from nature.**
Born yet not possessed.
Earlier words spoke of action without refusal—
this follows the natural order of things,
letting them arise and transform as they will.

Next, it is said: *born yet not possessed*—
the sage empties his heart to respond to things,
how could he claim what is born as his own?

The *I Ching* says: *"Qián (乾) is stillness, its essence is singular."*
The heavens and earth contain *yin* and *yang*,
and *yin* and *yang* give birth to all things.
The Dao never takes charge—
does the sage then merely *shī* (尸) it?

Then one knows that the sage governs the Dao yet not things;
to govern things would only muddle his heart.

Zhuangzi says: *"The Dao does not desire mixing, mixing brings multiplicity."*
Is this not what is meant?

This all clarifies the principle of **non-action**.

Five, **Not relying on cleverness**.
Doing yet not claiming credit.

The first two lines speak of *wuwei*—this speaks of *youwei*, for *wuwei* is the root of *youwei*.
The Classic says: *"Do *wuwei* and nothing remains untamed."* Now it clarifies *doing yet not claiming*—meaning one does not boast or take pride.
What was earlier called *"acting yet not refusing"*—when things are within proper bounds, the actor cannot refuse.
Next, *"born yet not possessed"*—bringing things to a state of emptiness, hence not claiming what is born as one’s own.
This reveals how the sage operates within *wuwei* yet never ceases to act.

From *youwei* to *wuwei*, the world is already governed, officials fulfill their duties, ruler and subject, father and son follow their order, friends keep their trust, rites and virtue shine forth, punishments are clear, artisans are complete, the four barbarian lands submit, and the people are settled.
The sage, in this, does not claim the merit—then to whom does it belong?
The sage acts at first with no intention, completes it with no intention.
For all dusty causes are inherently empty, the sage’s heart is but emptiness itself.
This is the Dao of the Great Sage.

If one merely does one thing and calls it *ren*, performs one act and calls it *yi*, then boasts and takes pride before others, this is but the deed of a petty conqueror—how could it compare to the ancient rectification of the world?

Six, **Spiritual transformation leaves no trace**.
Merit completed, no dwelling upon it—the Dao has no fixed form; it adapts to things as its form.
Always without a fixed mind, yet the mind adapts as it acts.
The echo arises—whether in sound, in things born, in color, or in holding with hands and walking with feet, in dreams, thoughts, and waking awareness—before one thought fades, another arises. The mind, originally empty of defilements, acts thus. The sage, aware of this, claims nothing.

Thus, one who completes merit occupies their station, yet if they do not depart, they cling to the traces of *youwei*.
Clinging to *youwei* leads only to rigidity and stagnation—how could this be the mind of the Daoist?
It is said: *"Once obtained, fear losing it."* If one fears losing it, they will stoop to anything.
How much more so for the sage who has achieved governance?
The sage is not thus.
They embody Heaven’s movement, like the four seasons’ cycles—merit completed, they depart, and departing, they leave no attachment.
The *I Ching* says: *"Riding a hollow wooden boat."*
Not only does the departing one act thus, but even while in station, their heart is the same.
If it were otherwise, the Dao would have attachment and departure.
What is now called *"completing merit yet not dwelling"* is the proper way of advance and retreat.
The *I Ching* says: *"Knowing advance and retreat, survival and perishing, yet not losing one’s proper course—is this not the sage alone?"*
This is the meaning of *Qián’s* (乾) extreme *yang* using the trigrams of Nine.
*"Dwelling in the broadest realm of the world"*—Mencius’ words are true.
*"Under a great name, it is hard to remain long"*—the words of the *Yīyī* (鸱夷子) are true.
*"Neither extreme can stand; the middle path requires no fixing"*—the words of the *Release School* are true.
*"Inner observation ignites fire; in the tenth month, the embryo sheds its shell"*—the words of the True Person are true.
To know this—who but the sage could attain it?

「The essence of the heart is no more than this.
If it is not so, then the Dao will have attachment and departure.

What is called *"not dwelling"* is why it does not depart.
What is called *departure*—that is name and position.
What cannot depart—is the independent and unchanging self.

*Dao De Zheng Jing Ji Yi* Volume Five concludes.
*Dao De Zheng Jing Ji Yi* Volume Six begins.
Master *Ning Yuan*’s *Chang De Lu* presents the profound and mysterious observation of virtue.

*Observing Affairs* by *Liu Wei Yong* was compiled and edited,
*Ding Yi Dong*, a former *Feng Da Fu* (奉大夫), *Tai Fu Si* (太府寺) registrar, and concurrent editor at the *Gong Mi Yuan* (枢密院), verified the text.

**Chapter: The World All Knows**

*Shào Ruò Yú* (邵若愚) said:
*"The world all knows, yet the Dao does not depart."*

Those who know what the world calls *beauty* and follow it—this is to love what is evil.
Those who know what the world calls *good* and follow it—this is to do what is not good.

Why is this?
To observe the mutual generation of *having* and *not having*,
the interplay of *difficulty* and *ease*,
the manifestation of *long* and *short*,
the inclination of *high* and *low*,
the harmony of *sound* and *voice*,
the succession of *before* and *after*—
these are the six pairs.

Worldly beings, clinging to beauty and goodness, obstruct themselves with worldly affairs,
their true nature follows external conditions,
thus generating *eight thousand and four thousand afflictions* (八万四千烦恼).
Hence, they act without intent,
do without attachment,
and thus can align with all things,
govern the world,
and instruct without words.

Though all things arise together,
the sage does not distinguish them with speech,
fearing that the people would develop likes and dislikes.
The sage takes no action for himself,
demands nothing from the people,
and relies on *non-action* (無為) to settle them.
Thus, the people do not know the sage’s transformation,
though he is their ruler and father,
he does not depend on it.
His deeds complete, yet he does not dwell upon them.

It is because he does not dwell in outward traces
that his *virtue/power* (德) remains and does not depart.

*Wáng Zhì Rán* (王志然) said:
*"The world all knows, yet the Dao does not depart."*

Good and evil, right and wrong—
these are the ancient and modern methods of *opposing treatment* (對治).
The world has universally known them.

Yet those who love beauty have evil as their opposite,
and those who love goodness have ungoodness as their opposite.

If one knows where beauty, evil, goodness, and ungoodness lie,
then the beautiful will reveal itself as beautiful—*I do not know its beauty*;
the evil will reveal itself as evil—*I do not know its evil*;
how much more so with goodness and ungoodness?

Goodness that is not good,
beauty that is not beautiful—
what else could this be but reckless indulgence?

Yet goodness that is not good—
how could beauty not be beautiful?
Beauty that is beautiful—
how could goodness not be good?

Clarity reveals dust and filth,
mindful clarity distinguishes good and evil—
yet fools do the opposite.

As *Zhuāngzi* said: *"Good and evil, I call them emotions."* (是非吾謂之情者)

What I call *without emotion*—
that the person does not internally harm themselves with likes and dislikes,
always following nature without adding to it.

Why do worldly beings always fall into the realm of opposites,
unable to escape their confines?
They do not lean toward *having*, yet they lean toward *not having*;
they do not cling to *form*, yet they cling to *numbers*.

Thus, it is said: *having* and *not having*,
*difficulty* and *ease*,
*long* and *short*,
*high* and *low*,
*sound* and *voice*,
*before* and *after*.

Examining their origins,
they are not without cause—
there must be intent behind them.

Not favoring any single thing—this is called *constant not-having*;
not neglecting any single thing—this is called *constant having*.
Hence, *having* and *not having* mutually generate.

*Yán Jūn Píng* (嚴君平) said:
*"Without ease, one cannot know difficulty;
without difficulty, one cannot know ease."*

The ancients said: *"First difficulty, then ease"* (先難而後獲),
the *Classics* say: *"Many easings, many difficulties"* (多易又多難).
Hence, *difficulty* and *ease* mutually complete.

Without *short*, one cannot know *long*;
without *long*, one cannot know *short*—
as the *Commentary* says: *"Like the measure of a cubit."* (若尺寸是已)

Without *low*, one cannot know *high*;
without *high*, one cannot know *low*—
as the *Commentary* says: *"Like mountains and marshes."* (若山泽是已)

Without *voice*, one cannot know *sound*;
without *sound*, one cannot know *voice*.
The *Six Pitches* (六律) harmonize,
the *Eight Sounds* (八音) accord—
this is the *sound* and *voice* that must harmonize.

Without *after*, one cannot know *before*;
without *before*, one cannot know *after*.
Spring comes first, followed by summer,
the long precedes the short—
this is the *before* and *after* that must succeed.

The six pairs do not depart from their positions,
yet when viewed by outward traces,
they are never the same;
when viewed by the Dao,
they are never different.

Not even like the sage governing the world,
using the *Way of non-action* (無為之道) to manage it,
then nothing remains ungoverned.

Hence, *"I use non-action, yet the people transform themselves"* (我無為而民自化),
*"I instruct with speechless teaching"* (以不言之教教之天下),
making the people not desire,
achieving harmony through stillness and silence.

The world’s spoken and heard teachings,
its learned and verbose doctrines—
where would they open their mouths?

Hence, *"I love stillness, yet the people align themselves"* (我好靜而民自正).

The sage does nothing.
If he acts, then all things see what he has done—
this is to have something to govern.

If one is born and yet has something—
they have not forgotten themselves.
If one acts and yet depends on it—
they have something to rely upon.
If one’s deeds complete and yet they dwell upon them—
they have something to bind themselves to.

Only by not acting for oneself,
not having anything for oneself,
not relying upon anything for oneself,
not dwelling upon anything for oneself—
can one soar with the Dao above all things,
and remain ever constant, never departing.

*Huáng Mào Cái* (黃茂材) said:
*"The world all knows, yet this does not make one good."*

The eyes find beauty in colors,
the ears find beauty in sounds,
the mouth finds beauty in flavors—
this is what the world calls *beauty*.

If one takes this as beauty,
would it not lead to evil?

To perform one good act is to be good,
to speak one good word is to be good—
though it may not suffice to advance toward the Dao,
it does not yet reach the level of evil.

Hence, *"This does not make one good."* (斯不善已)

What the world calls *beauty* is not sufficient to be beauty,
what the world calls *good* is not sufficient to be good.

Then what is truly *beauty* and *good*?

It is said:
*"Without taste, this is what I call beauty."*
*"To dwell where others find evil, this is what I call good."* (處人所惡，斯吾謂之善也)

Only when one knows this
can they then enter the Dao.»

The Dao arises from the interplay of *having* and *having-not*, manifesting in effortless action through silent teaching.

Having and having-not oppose each other, thus giving rise to one another;
Difficulty and ease oppose each other, thus completing one another;
Length and shortness oppose each other, thus defining one another;
Height and lowliness oppose each other, thus inclining one another;
Sound and music oppose each other, thus harmonizing one another;
Before and after oppose each other, thus following one another.

All things under heaven follow this pattern—
the Sage blends with humanity amidst them,
how could they abandon this principle?

Yet observing this truth,
their conduct is *wuwei*, yet their teaching is action.
They speak without speaking,
thus avoiding entanglement with things.
All things act without complaint,
thus they do not depart from this.

What fills the space between heaven and earth
is nothing but *having-not*.
Who is it that acts? Who is it that gives life? Who is it that does?
There must be a silent sovereign guiding this.

The Dao, though nameless, cannot be named;
the Dao, though without trace, cannot be traced.
Thus it is said: *"Act without complaint."*
But if one claims to have given life and takes credit for its function,
or acts and relies on its force,
then their understanding of the Dao is shallow.

The Sage embodies this—
not possessing, not relying—
what deeds cannot be accomplished?
To complete deeds without claiming them
is to *"give birth without possessing, act without relying."*
Thus, they align with the Dao and become one,
omitting nothing, needing no distance from others.

Program Tai said:
*"All under heaven know this, yet it is not good."*
What is praised and esteemed is called *beauty*,
what is fitting is called *good*—
though *beauty* and *good* are indeed precious,
they cannot be made known to all.

I reveal to them what they see,
yet I hold it in high regard—
they will surely imitate it.
Like a lamb in tiger’s skin,
it only serves to confuse the truth.

Thus, when all under heaven know this as *good* and *beauty*,
they fall into what is *not good* and *not beautiful*.

When the world values humility,
there will be those who secretly seek while publicly declining,
pretending to refuse to fulfill their desires.
When frugality is esteemed,
there will be those in tattered robes and broken carriages,
carrying their own food in a basket—
these are those who deliberately degrade themselves
to satisfy others’ desires, though not truly so.

But those who embody the Dao
conceal their actions without display,
letting people follow without knowing.
In the age of supreme virtue,
people love one another without calling it *ren*,
they are upright without calling it *yi*—
this is its effect.

Just as infants follow calves,
unaware that following is *filial piety*,
yet truly merging with it—
this is the genuine *filial piety*.

The Master Lao spoke of the Dao’s naturalness,
all of this kind.

Thus, *having* and *having-not* reach perfect complementarity.
True *beauty* and true *good* exist—
this is what is called *having*.
If done deceptively, then it is merely *having-not*.

Accumulating thought and action to achieve *beauty* and *good* is difficult,
but mimicking their semblance is easy.
True *beauty* does not generate *beauty* but *evil*,
true *good* does not generate *good* but *not-good*.
Why?
Because accumulating thought and *good* is difficult,
while selling falsehood as truth is easy.

Thus, displaying *beauty* and *good* to observe,
desiring all under heaven to follow the easy path—
they act to supplement what they lack,
while deceiving those who do not know.
This principle naturally follows in sequence.

Length and shortness incline toward one another.
The heart of vanity and self-aggrandizement is universal.
The rulers openly proclaim *beauty* and *good* to the world,
yet those who lack them feel shame,
knowing the difficulty—
when they follow the easy path,
acting to gain what they lack,
their perceived shortcomings become exposed in their striving for superiority,
thus they prop up their lowliness to topple others’ heights—
this is the root of transforming *good* into *evil*, *beauty* into *ugliness*.

Sound and music follow one another.
Sound is human voice,
the structured form of music.
When the song ascends above,
the *pao* and bamboo respond to create harmony—
this is how they harmonize.
As for their sequence of harmony,
they constantly pursue one another.

Zhuangzi said:
*"I sell it, and they buy it."*
Applying this principle to governance,
it extends beyond mere harmony of sound and voice.

One transmits to ten, ten to a hundred—
the following of before and after never ceases.
Thus, what the rulers intend
cannot be made known to all.

This is the essence of supreme action.

The Master Lao’s teaching of *wuwei* is vast in scope,
yet his guidance varies with each matter.
This *wuwei* speaks of guiding transformation through action.
Though the heart discerns right and wrong,
the outward appearance remains entirely erased.

Those who describe *beauty* truly hold it in their hearts,
yet do not reveal their admiration for it;
those who are *good* truly hold it in their hearts,
yet do not display their approval of it.
In their actions,
they silently act without leaving traces—
this is the affair of *wuwei*.

Why do they do this?
For fear that outward intentions,
once exposed, will let people habituate to their virtues
and counterfeit their sincerity.

As for *"dwelling"*—
they stand firm here, settled and at ease,
unburdened by other concerns.

To teach through silent action:
Communication between self and others must rely on speech,
yet if teaching is proclaimed without explanation,
how will people know what to follow?

This passage warns against the love of outward forms,
where people abandon themselves to falsehood.

To name this deed as *beauty*,
to display this person as *good*,
to manifest in praise and borrowings,
to spread through decrees—
when people follow what is called *beauty* and *good*,
and imitate their semblance,
then the original *true beauty* and *true good*
will all turn into mere pretense.

Laozi thus examined the origins of this falsity and reversed it. Within, the mechanism of spontaneous transformation never ceases, yet outwardly, no signs of suppression or elevation are shown. Thus, those who drift between these states cannot know what to follow to ascend. Therefore, he says, *"The Dao does not enlighten the people; it seeks to make them simple."*

This is the essence of teaching without words.

But when distinctions of rank are established between teachers and disciples, and precedence is drawn between those born first and last, then even the silent teaching—though profound as the abyss—resounds like thunder.

All things arise and achieve great deeds without claiming them.
*"Arising"* means to stir and uphold the teaching.
*"Generating"* is like gentle movement, nurturing life—teaching takes root in people, and goodwill begins to sprout, for this is how it gives birth.
*"Doing"* refers to the realm of action, while *"achievement"* belongs to those who transform the world through self-so and self-receiving, returning its effects to the Dao.

The affairs of *wuwei* and the teaching of *non-speech* are not private rules set in every household. Instead, they embrace the vast indifference of Heaven and Earth, governing the four seas with a single touch.

All who can arise and respond to the teaching are welcomed—none are ever rejected or declined.
*"To the good, I am good; to the ungood, I am also good"*—this is called *not declining*.

When goodwill begins to sprout and the teaching takes effect, yet one still refuses to claim credit, this is *not possessing and not relying*.

When action, generation, and doing all reach completion, the deed is fulfilled—yet it is abandoned without attachment, as if one had never been involved. Ah! How vast this is.

Before completion, it is taken as one’s responsibility; when completed, it is not claimed as one’s achievement. This is why the Great Dao does not seek to establish virtue.

Only what is utterly unceasing endures. All that is formed must eventually decay, all that is numbered must eventually exhaust—thus, all that exists tends toward nonexistence. How then can departure be retained?

But if achievement is completed without claiming it, it is as if it never existed. What belongs to the Dao cannot be depleted or destroyed—how then can it depart?

The flowers of spring declare their own virtue in blooming, so their splendor can be replaced. The fruits of autumn take responsibility for gathering and refining, so their harvest can fall. But the Original Qi moves beyond the four seasons, generating without being generated, transforming without being transformed—thus enduring eternally through the ages. This, having neither attachment nor departure, is called *"from ancient times to the present, its name does not fade, as it oversees all things."*

Confucian scholars lament that the people are difficult to awaken, while Laozi laments that they are not simple enough. Hence, he says, *"The people are difficult to govern because they are too clever,"* and *"When the people have many sharp tools, the state grows confused."* Yet when speaking of his own approach, he says, *"The Dao does not enlighten the people; it seeks to make them simple,"* and *"Fish cannot be lifted from the depths, nor can the state’s sharp tools be displayed before the people."*

Pursuing this logic, those who fiercely condemn sagely wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness, desiring to abandon their implements, do not truly oppose these virtues themselves. For he says, *"Wisdom and insight, when overdeveloped, breed great falsity,"*—this is the root of his corrective intent.

Indeed, the establishment of rites and laws began with Xuanyu and Yao. Their creation was meant to supplement the simplicity of knotted cords. But once their simplicity was seen as deficient, those who followed inevitably leaned toward excess. When excess grew, institutions and mechanisms spread until they became overt and exposed—then the clever among the people, seeing them, also began to manipulate them. Thus, the sage could use wisdom to restrain the people, while the people could use their cleverness to disrupt the laws.

This is why Laozi blamed the proliferation of wisdom and sought to correct it with *wuwei*. He feared that enlightening the people would spawn falsity and sought to correct it with *wuji* (non-tracing).

For rivers fill while valleys empty, hills level while depths fill—once opposites arise, neither can dominate. Thus, sagely wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness must inevitably fall into the realm of abandonment.

Yet Laozi, though he ultimately rejects them, still employs them to embody the Dao—so what he truly condemns is not their essence, but the propagation of sharp tools to enlighten the people.

Examining these two passages closely, is it not clear?

When he says *"do not exalt the worthy,"* he does not mean all are equal in merit—only that he refuses to display them openly. He warns against the danger of erecting grand structures to attract those who seek fame.

When the world knows beauty and goodness as beauty and goodness, then entering the realm of *not-beauty* and *not-goodness* is also a silent operation, preventing people from rushing into pretense and false imitation.

Yet when teachers and disciples are both employed, with distinctions of high and low, and when movement and stillness are both established, with emotions stirring naturally—though outwardly appearing inclusive, inwardly there remains discrimination.

He governs the world with an all-encompassing public stance, yet within, he employs subtle mechanisms to move the hearts of people. This method stems from the *Yijing*’s principle of *"manifesting in virtue, concealing in use."* The manifest refers to what can be demonstrated; the concealed refers to the profound, inscrutable source of transformation.

Though rites, music, punishments, and governance have been established as tools of governance, the concern remains that people can be made to follow without truly understanding. Thus, those who grasp the totality of the Dao to craft these tools—even if they wished to reveal it—could find no way to do so.

「Thus, the *Yijing*’s principle of *concealing in use* reaches its ultimate expression in *entering the divine* (入神). *Entering the divine* means moving without haste yet swiftly, acting without effort yet arriving with perfect effect. This is precisely what the Old Master (老氏) imitated when he spoke of *"non-action yet nothing left undone"* (无为而无不为).

Yet, he altered the phrasing, merely applying it as a means to establish his own doctrine. Scholars dare not use this to critique the *Yijing*, but instead all employ it as a basis to condemn the Old Master, which is a matter of unclear judgment indeed.

However, his methods of implementation do not entirely diverge from the *Yijing*, and this cannot be concealed. The *Yijing* seeks to *manifest in virtue* (显诸仁) yet fails, thus lamenting the common folk’s ignorance, unable to align them with the *virtue of the wise and the enlightened* (仁智之有见).

The Old Master, however, directly aims to deceive them, waiting until they are *without knowledge and without desire* (无知无欲), before he then *takes and seizes* (取歙张) them, emerging from within. Here lies their difference.

Zhan Qiupu (詹秋圃) said: *"All under Heaven know ‘the utmost’ yet do not attain it."* In the chapter on *Nurturing the Body* (养身), he first seeks to *forget oneself in the realm of unknowing and unrecognizing* (不识不知之表), yet ultimately desires *contraries giving rise to each other* (相反相成), without magnifying his own greatness to dwell in the greatness of all under Heaven.

Hence, it is said: *"All under Heaven know beauty as beauty, goodness as goodness; yet this very pursuit of beauty and goodness may lead to perversion and distortion, resulting in evil and wickedness."* The pairing of *"good deeds"* (善事) and *"action"* (为) reflects how opposites generate each other and reach their extreme in mutual dependence. The rise and fall of each arise from their kind, thus the Sage acts in *non-action* (无为), teaches through *non-speech* (不言), entrusting all things to *this generates that* (此作彼应) without complaint. He gives life yet does not possess it, acts yet does not claim it—though his deeds are accomplished, he does not dwell upon them, but rather *pushes them away* (推之) and they do not depart.

Indeed, those who excel in *nurturing the body* (养身) can *retire after success* (功成身退), thereby *dwelling in security and deepening their roots* (居安资深), and would never lose their *shoulders and backs* (肩背) for the sake of it.

Zhang Chongying (张冲应) replied: *"All under Heaven know ‘the utmost’ yet do not attain it."* The Dao abhors excess and upholds humility (谦).

Though talent is beautiful, those who are praised for their beauty will ultimately *arouse envy* (起妬). Though virtue is good, those who are praised for their virtue will ultimately *spark contention* (起争). Envy harms the body, contention harms the body as well. Thus, Pang Juan (庞涓) flaunted his talent and fell into the *tree’s shadow disaster* (树下之失), while Han Xin (韩信) coveted his name and met his end in the *Cloud Dream purge* (云梦之诛). These are matters unworthy of discussion with the *mysterious Dao* (玄道).

The Sage, when he emerges, does not rely upon his unique talents, but instead harbors the mind of *seeing action in non-action* (见有为无). He does not grudge the difficulty of his accomplishments, but rather holds the thought of *seeing difficulty as ease* (见难为易).

When others are short and I extend them, their shortness is covered by my length—thus it is said, *contraries form each other* (相形). When others are high and I humble myself beneath them, their height is suppressed by my lowliness—thus it is said, *contraries topple each other* (相倾).

When one responds and the other resonates, their voices harmonize; when one leads and the other follows, above and below align naturally. The Sage governs through *non-action* and teaches through *non-speech*, using the Dao to regulate his body and his body to elucidate the Dao. His true heart is steadfast.

All things arise, yet his mind remains unperturbed—*desires are extinguished* (贪心绝矣). All things are born, yet he does not possess them—*his will can act yet does not indulge in its own doing* (志可为而不逞所为). Though his deeds are accomplished, he does not dwell in their position—thus Zhang Liang (子房) attained swiftness in *Red Pine’s wandering* (赤松之游速), and Zhongli Quan (锺离权) achieved leisure in *Jade Cavern’s departure* (玉洞之去忙), all through this cultivation.

With this cultivation, *vital essence endures* (精长固), *qi remains stored* (气长存), *spirit stays clear* (神长清), and thus the body *long-lives* (身长生). *Blessings and virtue* (福德) reside within yet do not depart.

Bai Yu Chan (白玉蟾) said: *"All under Heaven know beauty as beauty, goodness as goodness; those who seek fame in beauty and goodness, though they attain beauty and goodness, cannot escape the rise of evil. Those who seek to be called ‘good,’ though they perform good deeds and benefit others, ultimately become wicked."*

Hence, *having and non-having generate each other*—non-having must generate having, having must generate non-having. *Difficulty and ease complete each other*—first difficult, then easy; first easy, then difficult again. *Length and shortness form each other*—the Dao itself is formless, yet through self-extension, length and shortness arise. *High and low topple each other*—Heaven revolves, Earth turns; originally there is no high or low.

*Voices harmonize*—when one wind sounds, all ten thousand echoes respond. *Front and back follow each other*—the past is the present, the present is the past.

Thus, the Sage governs through *non-action* and values *naturalness* (自然). He teaches through *non-speech* and the Dao is embodied in things. All things arise from this, yet he does not refuse it.

Non-having must generate having—how could it not generate? If it did not generate, how could it endure long? He gives life yet does not possess it—non-having is merely false illusion. He acts yet does not claim it—*today is today alone* (今日今日而已). Though his deeds are accomplished, he does not dwell upon them—*how could it compare with reality, to dream of it?*

Only in *not dwelling* (弗居) does he *forget the external yet not forget the internal*—thus it is said, *it does not depart* (不去). *One self remains stored* (一我自存).

Liao Cuiran (廖粹然) said: *"All under Heaven know goodness as goodness; people take color, sound, fragrance, flavor, and physical form (触法) as their objects of attachment, indulging in joy, anger, love, hatred, sorrow, delight, and desires to make them their ‘strong goods’ (强美). I know this is not so.*

Why is this not so? Because *this very attachment is the root of evil* (斯恶已). Thus, those who love affairs are plagued by *demons* (魔), the *Seven Emotions* (七情) assault from within, the *Six Bandits* (六贼) invade from without, and all desires ultimately harm the body. I habitually remain *serene and indifferent* (恬憺无为), considering *learning the Dao and attaining the Dao* (学道得道) as the true ‘strong goods’—is this not beautiful?

All under Heaven know goodness as goodness, yet they also believe that goodness is the most joyous. Some perform good deeds, aid others, and benefit all things—these are all considered good actions. *I see otherwise*—why is this so?

「This is not virtue—why is this so? People are not Yao or Shun, yet some, before doing good deeds, first seek reward, bribing the superiors to keep their hearts. Others, when they have done good, fear it was not fully complete, and regret their efforts. I have practiced *clearing and quieting* (清静) to cultivate *awareness* (定慧), *calming the heart and nurturing the spirit* (安心养神), and thus regard *upholding the Dao and achieving its fulfillment* (守道而成功) as the supreme virtue—is this not joyous?

Hence, *the interplay of presence and absence* (有无相生) arises—this speaks of the *marvelous application of virtue and Dao* (道德妙用). *Difficulty and ease interdepend* (难易相成), marking the *beginning of transformation* (造化始端). *Length and shortness contrast* (长短相形), revealing the *substance and measure* (器质法度) of things. *High and low incline* (高下相倾), as Heaven and Earth undergo their ceaseless changes (变通). *Sounds harmonize* (音声相和), carried by winds and breaths (风气吹嘘). *Past and future follow* (前后相随), giving rise to the *birth and evolution of all things* (古今生化). These are all *the Dao’s marvels* (道妙), inexhaustible in their depth. Therefore, the sage *Laozi* (太上老子), known by the name of *Dao-attainment* (得道), is also called *Great Supreme* (大上), *Sage* (圣人), *the Virtuous One* (有道之士), *the Ruler of Men* (人主), *the Daoist* (道者), *the Lord of the Heart* (心君), or *the Great Man* (大丈夫)—each title fitting the occasion. To dwell in *non-action* (无为之事) is the *root principle* (根本). To practice *teaching without words* (行不言之教), the *Great Supreme* says:

*"Silent, silent, silent—
without bound, the Dao’s transcendent ones are born from this."*

All things act without claiming merit (作而不辞). The common folk use them daily, yet do not know they are my Dao. *To give birth without possession* (生而不有), *to transform endlessly* (生化无穷). *To act without reliance* (为而不恃), *to bestow kindness without seeking reward* (施恩而不望报). *To complete deeds without dwelling on them* (功成弗居), *to bring forth all things yet not lord over them* (生成万物而不为主). Only by *not dwelling on them* (弗居), *doing so out of self-love yet not arrogating superiority* (自爱而不自贵), is it that *they are never abandoned* (是以不去). Enduring from ancient times to the present, without beginning or end (亘古亘今，无来无去).

*Chen Bi Xu* (陈碧虚) said: All under Heaven know that virtue is not exhausted here—why is this so? For all under Heaven (天下者) refers to the *general scope* (举大凡而言) of everything beneath Heaven’s canopy (凡在天覆之下也). Virtue and goodness arise from *delusive emotions* (妄情). Ordinary people take what their emotions favor as good and what they reject as evil. If one indulges in *delusive emotions* (纵己妄情), what is not evil? They take what they affirm as good and what they deny as not good. If one indulges in *judgments of right and wrong* (纵己是非), how can there be true goodness?

*Zhuangzi* (庄子) said: Right and wrong are what I call *emotion* (情也). What I call *non-emotion* (无情者) is that people do not let their likes and dislikes internally harm their bodies; they follow their natural state without adding artificiality (常因自然而不益生也). This is called *stopping at what is truly fitting* (止於实当也).

The Sage, then, has virtue and goodness—yet they do not boast of them, making them equal to none. *Not boasting preserves their virtue* (不矜则德全), *equaling none keeps harm at bay* (同於无则害远). When virtue is complete and harm is distant, virtue and goodness are fully realized (美善尽矣). If rulers use virtue and goodness to transform all under Heaven, making them know virtue as virtue, this is not yet complete goodness. Hence, I say the *Book of Martial Virtue* (《武》) is fully beautiful, yet not fully virtuous (未尽善也). The *Classic* (《经》) says: *"The supreme virtue does not claim virtue* (上德不德), *the lesser virtue does not lose virtue* (下德不失德也)."

Moreover, virtuous people are few, while the unvirtuous are many. If one flaunts their virtuous deeds, stealing and mocking them, this is already evil—how can it be called virtue?

*Yan Jun Ping* (严君平) said: Clarity does not always endure, darkness does not always prevail. Honor and decay begin at the *Spring Equinox* (仲春), *qí mài* (荠麦) and *yáng wù* (阳物) emerge at the *Autumn Equinox* (秋分). On the *Winter Solstice* (冬至), all things flourish and thrive (滋滋), while on the *Summer Solstice* (夏至), all things wither and lament (愁悲). It speaks of how even at their peak, things must decline, and beauty must yield to evil (盛叉有衰，美必有恶). If this is true of *yin and yang* (阴阳), how much more so for humanity? This is a warning against *boasting of virtue and goodness* (矜夸美善者也).

Thus, from *the interplay of presence and absence* (有无之相生) to *the following of past and future* (前后之相随), these six principles arise—*because boasting of virtue and goodness leads to active interference* (因矜美善动入有为), *and once interference is evident, partiality and fixation emerge* (有为既彰，偏执斯起). Partiality and fixation breed mutual destruction (残贼互生), and things lose their nature (物失其性). Hence, the Sage’s *non-action* (无为) and *profound virtue* (渊德) remain unyielding (不去).

The interplay of presence and absence (有无之相生) is that *presence and absence inherently do not generate each other*—yet *to speak of presence, it must arise from absence*, and *to discuss absence, it must be born from presence*—hence, *presence and absence interdepend* (故曰有无之相生).

Difficulty and ease interdepend (难易之相成者也): It is that *difficulty and ease inherently do not form each other*—yet *like the potter, who finds clay easy to shape yet wood difficult*, or *the carpenter, who finds wood easy to work yet clay difficult*, *each finds what is easy in their own craft, yet difficulty emerges where it diverges*—thus, *difficulty and ease interdepend* (故曰难易之相成也).

Length and shortness contrast (长短之相刑者): It is that *length and shortness inherently do not define each other*—yet *when one sees a crane, one knows the mallard’s legs are short*, and *when one sees a mallard, one knows the crane’s legs are long*. By this mutual reference, all things are so—hence, *length and shortness contrast* (故曰长短之相形也).」

An inch is short by a foot’s measure, a foot is long by an inch’s standard;
Mountains crumble by valleys’ contrast, valleys tilt by mountains’ rise;
Sounds distinguish by tones’ contrast, tones cease by sounds’ accord;
What comes later is seen through what precedes, what follows is known through what comes first.

Thus, without the void, the manifest cannot be seen;
Without the manifest, the void cannot be known;
Without difficulty, ease cannot be discerned;
Without ease, difficulty cannot be understood;
Without length, shortness cannot be measured;
Without shortness, length cannot be defined;
Without mountains, valleys cannot be known;
Without valleys, mountains cannot be revealed;
Without tones, sounds cannot be distinguished;
Without sounds, tones cannot be heard;
Without what precedes, what follows cannot be grasped;
Without what follows, what precedes cannot be fathomed.

All these principles—
Heaven and Earth’s verifications, Nature’s immutable signs—
Are laid bare, neither concealed nor denied,
Their beginning and end cyclically reversing,
Unseparable, beyond even the divine’s evasion,
Yin and Yang cannot defy them.

Thus observed, the affairs of the Sage-King cannot be forced by contrivance.
Therefore, the Sage practices the teaching of *non-action* in conduct.

This speaks of the ancient Sage-King,
Who did not govern the world with artificial virtue,
Yet the world governed itself.
Thus, *"is with"* explains the lower to clarify the higher.

*Non-action* is not idle withdrawal into empty halls,
But the Sage forgetting all virtues, extinguishing emotions, restoring innate nature,
So the people act according to their capacities,
Things settle into their proper order,
And above and below remain undisturbed.
Thus, it is said: *"to dwell in non-action."*

To practice the teaching of *non-speech* means
To lead by personal example, rectify conduct, and intuitively respond to circumstances,
Acting in season, leveraging resources, achieving results without deliberate speech—
Thus, *"to practice the teaching of non-speech."*

When all things act, the Sage does not claim credit.
*Action* means movement.
The Sage governs the world in effortless ease,
Doing nothing, yet the people till and eat,
Weave and clothe themselves,
Content with suckling, joyful with full bellies,
Playing without aim—
Delighting in their natural endowments,
All movements virtuous, the transformation of *non-action*.

Thus, the Sage entrusts them without interference.
The people can be led but not made to understand—
This is the wind of the Supreme Virtue’s *non-virtue*.

Born yet not possessing, achieving yet not dwelling.
All things generate spontaneously, each in its own transformation,
Not claimed as one’s own, yet all striving fulfills its nature,
Not relying on personal merit—
When deeds are complete and affairs settled,
The Way is realized in things,
The mind wanders at Maoshu’s peaks,
Not lording over the people—
This is the Sage’s complete virtue.

Only by not dwelling does one not depart.
The Sage’s deeds align with Nature’s creation,
Ensuring all things reach their utmost,
Yet forgets name and self.

*Not dwelling* means not claiming rank or treasure as one’s own,
So the people remain unaware, unknowing—
Thus, the Way does not perish, virtue does not fade.

*The Honglie Explanation* says:
When Chu’s General Zi Fa attacked Cai Yu, King Xuan of Qin welcomed him at the capital,
Granting him a hundred *mu* of land and the ceremonial jade tablet of a high official.
Zi Fa declined, saying:
*"To govern a state and establish policies, to receive visiting lords—
This is the king’s virtue.
To issue commands and the enemy flees before battle—
This is the general’s might.
To array troops and defeat the foe—
This is the common soldier’s strength.
To ride upon the people’s labor and take their rewards—
This is not the Way of Ren and Yi."*
Thus, he declined and did not accept.

Hence, *"achieving yet not dwelling"*—
Only by not dwelling does one not depart.

Xie Tusou said:
All under Heaven know what is supremely good.
When the Sage governs the world,
Good governance and fine transformations penetrate the hearts of the people,
Yet they do not recognize them as such.
Later generations implement a policy or decree, and the people call it good;
They establish a benefit or remove a harm, and the people praise it—
This is not impossible,
Yet what is manifest to all may not touch their hearts.

Thus, the unknowing are deeply moved,
While the knowing barely acknowledge it—
The profound is hard to exhaust, the shallow easily exposed.
If it is easily exposed,
Then the shift from good to evil, from virtue to vice,
Is but a turn of the hand—
Hence the warning against *having* and *not having*, *difficulty* and *ease*—
Its meaning is profound.

Thus, *having* and *not having* are inseparably linked.
Without level, there is no slope;
Without forward, there is no return.
The Sage alone ensures that what is called *good* is not evil,
That what is called *virtue* is not vice.

Without life, there is no death;
Death gives rise to life again.
Difficulty becomes ease, ease becomes difficulty;
Length and shortness, height and low—
Mutually contrasted, tilted, reversing, ever-changing,
With no fixed beginning.

Like sounds moving to tones’ harmony,
Or what precedes guiding what follows—
This is the necessary logic, the inevitable course.

Thus, the Sage’s virtue is never lost.
The Sage knows the world’s nature is ever-shifting,
So he follows Nature’s spontaneous order,
Acts without contrivance,
Teaches without speech—
Yet when called *good* or *beautiful*,
Who can truly know?

When things must act, the Sage does not shirk responsibility;
When things must be born, the Sage does not claim the benefit;
Doing without doing, yet not relying on ability;
Achieving without achieving, yet not dwelling on success—
All under Heaven find their proper place,
While the Sage seems uninvolved.

Yet though he does not dwell on his deeds,
Where would the world turn without the Sage?
The Sage has no designs on the world,
Yet the world cannot be without the Sage.

This is why it was the age of ancient Sage-Kings.
Indeed, examining it:
The rise and fall of ages, the waxing and waning of human nature and things—
How unequal they are!

The *Tai* yielding to *Pi*, *Yi* to *Sun*,
*Sue* to *Jian*, *Ji* to *Wei*—
The *Yi* has already spoken of this.
Yet the Sage comprehends these transformations,
Divinizes their changes,
Ever guiding the people through tireless motion,
Moving them in the realm of the unknown—
Thus, the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun
Governed with effortless ease,
Yet the world was in harmony,
And all things flourished without decree.

「Later generations adorned their actions as achievements,
And twisted their ways to display their abilities,
Boasting virtues and flaunting beauty—
Yet how could they fail to unsettle the people’s ears and eyes?
It is like cutting colored silk to claim elegance,
Or drawing water to feign depth.
The intent of nurturing and propagating life does not dwell within them,
And their downfall comes swiftly and surely.
How could they ever be considered models of perfect virtue and beauty?

Lin Yongzai remarked: *All under Heaven knows the utmost, yet does not cling to it.*
This chapter embodies the principle of *having while not possessing*.

Where there is beauty, there is ugliness;
Where there is virtue, there is vice.
Beauty unknown as beauty,
Virtue unknown as virtue—
Then there is no ugliness, no vice.

For all things in the world,
There is presence and absence,
Difficulty and ease,
Length and brevity,
Height and low,
Sound and voice,
Front and back.
The six lines of *mutual generation and completion*
All metaphorically illustrate the paired opposites of beauty and ugliness,
Virtue and vice.

Thus, the Sage acts without action,
Speaks without words—
Never shirking emptiness as idle,
Nor fearing excess as laborious,
But simply completing the task without claiming it.

Like the heavens and earth nurturing myriad things,
Through endless transformations and changes,
Pursuing one another without end—
Did they ever cease their toil?
All things flourish under heaven and earth,
Yet heaven and earth never claim them as their own.
Like spring and summer, life and death,
Creation’s work never relies on them as proof of its power.
Thus, they give birth without possession,
Act without reliance—
Their intent lies solely in *completing the task without claiming it*.

Hence, the three lines: *All things act, yet they do not claim to be the originators.*
*—作* (zuò) is akin to the *Yijing*’s *Kūn* (坤), which "acts to complete things."*
This reflects Shun and Yu’s *receiving the Mandate of Heaven yet not taking it as their own*.

From ancient times, all Sages were thus—
Why single out Laozi?

Only by *not claiming* does one *not lose*.
Those who possess what they have cannot truly have it,
While those who do not claim what they possess can truly have it.
These eight characters hold profound meaning.
The *Shū* (书) says: *He who has virtue yet loses virtue*—
This is its very essence.

When sound harmonizes with form, it is called *music*—
Hence, *sound and voice in accord*.

Fan Yingyuan noted: *All under Heaven knows the utmost, yet does not cling to it.*
*—至* (zhì) is pronounced *yǐ* (以), a grammatical particle.
Since ancient times, Sages have embodied this Dao in their dealings with affairs—
Their way of attaining perfect beauty and virtue,
Yet people unaware of their true beauty and virtue,
Is that affairs unfold naturally,
Each with its proper course.

Thus, the Sage follows nature’s logic,
Acts with measured harmony,
Never boasting or claiming credit for beauty or virtue.
If one boasts of beauty or claims virtue,
And makes all under Heaven aware of it—
Then ugliness and vice must surely follow.
Hence, *presence and absence generate and follow one another.*

This further confirms the opposites of beauty and ugliness,
Virtue and vice.
Therefore, the Sage’s *uttermost teaching*.

The Sage’s *uttermost teaching*—
This is the meaning of *continuing from above to below*.
The Sage, pure in the Dao,
Also called *the great and transformative*—
All that follows does likewise.

To dwell in *non-action* is to embody the Dao—
The Dao is ever *non-acting* yet never *not acting*,
And the Sage remains empty-hearted while responding to things.

To practice *unsaid teaching* is to align with Heaven—
Heaven speaks not, yet
The four seasons pass in its course,
And myriad creatures flourish in its embrace.
The Sage follows principle to benefit all,
Nothing left unaligned—
This is the *unsaid teaching*.

*All things act, yet they do not claim to be the originators*—
The ancient texts, as per Wang Bi and Yang Xu, agree.

*—作* (zuò) is motion.
Silent and still, yet sensing and thus fully responsive—
This is the Dao.
The Sage embodies the Dao in establishing things,
Responds only after being moved,
Thus, *they do not claim to be the originators*.

From *giving birth without possession* to *All under Heaven knows the utmost, yet does not cling*—
Fu Yi remarked: *The ancient texts all read "dwell" (处).*
All things’ generation, propagation, and movement
Arise from the Dao.
Yet the Dao never claims them as its own,
Nor relies on them for its power—
Until the task is complete, it never dwells on it.
Only by *not dwelling on the task’s completion*
Does one ensure that things do not resist.

The Sage embodies the Dao in standing,
Thus also *they give birth without possession*—
How could ugliness and vice follow?

Xue Yongzai said: *All under Heaven knows the utmost, yet does not cling*—
*To the paired opposites of front and back.*

Where there is beauty, there is ugliness;
Where there is virtue, there is vice—
No affair in the world lacks its counterpart.
These six are but one corner of the whole.

Yanzi’s *"As if standing firm upon something"*—
Surely there are opposites to it.

Therefore, the Sage’s *uttermost teaching*.
*—作而不为* (zuò ér bù wéi) is the affair of *non-action*,
*—言而不言* (yán ér bù yán) is the teaching of *no words*—
The Sage thus transcends all opposites.

Heaven and earth are *unbenevolent*,
Treating myriad things as *straw dogs*.
The Sage conforms to and mirrors them.
Only by *not claiming* does one *not lose*—
In their lack of dwelling, they also lack nothing to abandon.

Resting in the *Resting Pavilion* (休休庵) remarked:
*All under Heaven knows the utmost, yet does not cling*—
*To the paired opposites of front and back.*

The Three Powers established,
Myriad things born,
Radiance and luster flourish,
Names and forms appear.
Common folk know myriad things’ beauty,
Their utility in sustaining life—
Yet those who prize it fail to recognize the nurturing grace,
This is called *ugliness*.

Even if all know that creation’s movement,
Life and death’s unfolding,
Is virtue—
Those who take this as virtue
Only see the Three Powers’ *virtue/power*,
Yet fail to grasp the great Dao,
This is called *vice*.

Alas! To be blind to the Dao and lost in virtue,
To chase superficial ends while forgetting the root—
Day by day, their corruption deepens.

Though humans are the most enlightened,
They cannot reflect upon their original,
Pure, luminous, and wondrous nature—
Endowed with great *divine penetration*,
Capable of mastering all phenomena,
Possessing *non-action’s wondrous efficacy*—
Yet they pursue illusions and vie in *action*,
Their emotions and perceptions ensnared,
Bound by the Five Desires and Eight Winds,
Their greed, anger, delusion, and attachment wreaking havoc.

The Dao/Way gives rise to existence from non-existence,
Existence gives rise to non-existence,
Non-existence and existence mutually generate endlessly.

What is done in the world,
Some is difficult, some is easy—
Difficult things bring forth suffering,
Easy things bring forth joy,
And suffering and joy, difficulty and ease,
Mutually arise and fulfill one another.

Actions have virtue and vice,
Principles have strengths and weaknesses—
Strengths and weaknesses contrast,
And thus power has highs and lows,
Mutually inclining and countering one another.
Good and bad, sounds and tones,
Intermingle and blend,
Right and wrong,
One has not yet ceased,
The other follows in its wake—
Who would resolutely reflect,
Returning to simplicity,
Restoring to purity?

Thus the Sage dwells in non-action’s Dao/Way,
Yet never departs from it.

The Sage is one who comprehends the great Dao,
And broadens ultimate virtue/power.

The Master [Buddha] said:
*"Sever desire, abandon love,
Know the heart, attain the root,
Awaken to non-action’s dharma,
Internally gain nothing,
Externally seek nothing—
The heart does not cling to the Dao,
Nor does it bind to karma.
Without thought, without action,
Neither practice nor attainment,
Not passing through all stages,
Yet naturally exalted,
This is called the Dao."*

The Dao of non-action
Unites myriad virtues,
Dissolves collective confusion,
Responds to circumstances,
Aids the faltering,
Supports the endangered,
With wondrous natural efficacy.

Like spring moving through all lands,
Wind sweeping the boundless void.

Those who attain the great Dao
Do not boast of action’s achievements,
But trust in non-action’s Dao,
With virtue’s natural harmony,
Equal to all of existence—
Without words, people transform themselves.
Cultivating the self, harmonizing the family,
Govern the state, bring peace to the world—
Never for a moment can one depart from the Dao.

Those who take the Dao as their essence,
Their virtue/power aligns with Heaven and Earth,
Lofty, bright, vast, and profound,
All things arise together yet they do not reject them,
Nurturing all things without claiming ownership,
Mastering all phenomena without relying on their eminence,
Great deeds accomplished yet they do not dwell in their position.

Only those who do not dwell in great deeds,
Nor rule over others,
Are without loss.

Without honor or disgrace,
They transcend right and wrong.

Abandoning is losing.
Chu Bo-xiu said:
*"All know the Dao’s utmost extent,
Yet fail to depart from it."*

Externally in things,
There are beauties and virtues—
All know and delight in them;
Internally in oneself,
There are true beauties and true virtues—
Few know and do not pursue them.

Beauty and virtue arise from human desire,
Yet sometimes they are not beautiful nor virtuous.
True beauty and true virtue root in Heaven’s principle,
Everlasting through ages, ever beautiful and ever virtuous.

What the world calls good or bad,
Right or wrong,
All belong to deluded emotions—
One’s "right" is another’s "wrong."
Who can truly grasp the proper?

Born from the six pairs of opposites,
They spread endlessly—
Like the rise and fall of yin and yang,
Or the waxing and waning of existence and non-existence;
Difficulty and ease, deeds and failures—
The crane’s height reveals the duck’s shortness,
The mountain’s grandeur shows the marsh’s lowliness;
Sound emerges, yet tone arises,
Spring precedes, summer follows—
Even these mutually arising and fulfilling opposites
Cannot forever preserve beauty and virtue,
How much more so when they contrast and incline against one another?

The Sage investigates the origins,
Rescues defects,
Leading by example—
Non-action yet deeds are accomplished,
No words yet teachings are established,
People enjoy their customs,
Things fulfill their nature.

Plowing, digging, sowing—
These are things’ deeds,
I do not reject them,
Nurturing and fostering their growth.

These are things’ births,
I do not claim them,
Letting things act naturally—
What must be done cannot be avoided by me.
Why should I rely on my own efforts?

Only because they do not dwell in great deeds,
Thus their deeds cannot be abandoned.

Zhuangzi said:
*"I forget the world easily,
But making the world forget me is difficult."*
Truly so.

Some may debate:
Why, after naming the Dao as "non-existence,"
Does this chapter suddenly turn to beauty and vice,
And the six pairs of opposites?

For where the Dao exists,
Things arise;
Where things arise,
Names follow.
What is called "non-existence" is hidden,
But beauty and vice are names of things,
And deeds’ traces cannot escape the six pairs.

The Sage does not defy things’ nature,
But lets them flow, rise, and fall—
Sometimes contrary to principle,
Yet adjusts and rectifies accordingly,
Treating ailments with medicine,
Each restored to health.

When the illness departs and the medicine is removed,
The Sage’s heart is also empty.
How can the six pairs of opposites be avoided?

Niu Miao said:
*"All know the Dao’s utmost extent,
Yet fail to depart from it—
Beauty is delight,
Virtue is also delight.
Vice and non-virtue are both spoken of as not delightful."*

Even as in the world a single good deed,
Once fixed, is sure to turn bad—
This is the hidden calamity in prosperity,
The danger in security,
The interplay of fortune and misfortune.

No beauty is more beautiful than serving a lord,
Yet serving too often brings disgrace.
No virtue is more virtuous than friendship,
Yet too many friends bring estrangement.

*The Baopuzi* says:
*"Draped curtains gather mist,
Silken hangings blend with clouds—
Collecting fragrant blossoms in the grove of orchids,
Playing with red flowers in the pool of pearls,
Entering the dim glow of the Eight Gates of Darkness,
Exiting with the splendor of the Vermilion Wheels.
Yet when joy reaches its peak,
Sorrow gathers in its wake;
When fullness is attained,
Deficiency follows inevitably."*

This is the way beauty and vice intertwine—
All people in the world know this principle.

Thus non-existence and existence mutually generate,
From non-existence arises existence,
From existence not ceasing arises non-existence—
Non-existence generates existence,
Existence returns to non-existence,
Existence has form yet generates shadow,
Sound arises yet produces echo—
Non-existence moves yet generates existence,
Existence arises and returns to non-existence’s generation;
Existence has form yet returns to non-form.

Not generating is not the original non-generating,
Not having form is not the original non-form.

Generating is the principle’s inevitable end,
Ending cannot but end,
Just as generating cannot but generate—
This is all the saying of existence and non-existence’s mutual generation.

Difficulty and ease mutually fulfill one another—
Difficulty is the gateway to ease,
Ease is the root of difficulty.

In the world, all things are difficult or easy,
Interdependent in their use—
Even a single difficult deed,
If diligently pursued, though difficult,
Will become easy—
Is this not ease?

*(End of translation.)*

「若以易心临之，则其为难矣。
If one approaches it with a careless heart, then it becomes difficult indeed.

古语有云：世上无难事，只怕有心人。
As the old saying goes: There are no difficult matters in the world—only those who lack resolve.

又曰：有心射山山须透，无心射纸纸难穿。
It is also said: With resolve, one may pierce mountains with an arrow; without it, even paper resists.

洞宾曰：难难十石芝麻树上摊，易易浑似和衣一觉睡。
Zhuangzi’s disciple Dongbin remarked: Difficult tasks weigh like ten stones on a sesame tree—
Effortless ones feel as natural as resting in one’s robes.

老君曰：天下之难事必作於易，天下之大事必作於细。
Laozi said: The world’s difficult matters arise from ease,
And great undertakings begin in the minute.

是以圣人犹难之，故终无难。
Thus, the Sage still regards them as difficult,
And so, in the end, there is no difficulty.

此难易相成之说也。

长短之相形。
The interplay of length and brevity.

夫物之不齐，物之情也。
Things are not uniform—this is their natural state.

是故无长不别短，无短不显长，
长短之势，相形方别。
Hence, there is no length without distinction from brevity,
No brevity without highlighting length—
The very nature of length and brevity reveals their contrast.

且鹤胫虽长，断之则悲，
凫胫虽短，续之则忧。
Even the crane’s long legs, if severed, bring sorrow,
And the short legs of the teal, if lengthened, cause distress.

古人有言曰：青松高百尺，绿穗低数寸。
The ancients said: The green pine soars a hundred feet,
While the humble reed bows but a few inches.

同生大块间，长短各有分。
Both spring from the same earth,
Yet each possesses its own measure.

如人之才性，亦各有长短。
So too with human talent and nature—
Each has its own strengths and weaknesses.

然各长其长，各短其短，
则鸢飞鱼跃，各得其所，
自无长短之非也。
Yet if each fulfills its own strengths,
And accepts its own weaknesses—
Then the falcon soars and the fish leaps,
Each finding its proper place,
And there is no fault in length or brevity.

若稍有片善，寸长自以为能，
则长短必相形而随之也。
But if one has even a shred of virtue,
And deems a single inch of length sufficient—
Then length and brevity will inevitably contrast and follow suit.

非斯之谓欤？

高下之相倾。
The interplay of elevation and humility.

夫高者尊也，下者卑也，
虽尊卑之礼固有定在，
然高而不谦，尊卑而不安分，
则相倾之势由是而生也。
Elevation is nobility, humility is lowliness—
Though the rites of rank have fixed distinctions,
Yet if one is elevated without modesty,
Or ranked without proper humility—
Then the very force of imbalance arises.

盖贵以贱为本，高以下为基，
若好高而不为高，则不高矣。
For nobility is rooted in humility,
And elevation depends on a foundation of lowliness—
If one seeks elevation yet does not act accordingly,
Then one cannot truly be elevated.

古语有云：墙高耶，雨剥而颓之；
渊卑耶，水就而归之。
As the old saying goes: A wall too high will crumble beneath the rain’s relentless assault;
A pool too low will fill with waters that flow toward it.

谚曰：岸上沙，今人担土旧人家；
陌上路，今人来往昔人墓。
A proverb states: Sands on the shore—
Now men carry soil to build homes where once none stood;
Paths through the fields—
Now men tread where once lay ancient graves.

由是观之，海水桑田之变，固有之矣。
Thus observed, the shifting of seas and fields is natural indeed.

此高下相倾之势也。
This is the force of elevation and humility in balance.

若以势而言之，则如王公之子归庶人，
庶人之子为王公。
If spoken of in terms of this force,
Then it is like the son of a noble returning to common birth,
Or the son of a commoner ascending to noble rank.

扬子云曰：朝得权为卿相，夕失势为匹夫。
Yangzi said: One may rise to minister in the morning,
And fall to commoner by evening.

此皆高下相倾之说也。

声音之相和。
The interplay of sound and resonance.

声者鸣也，鸣则有音，
音必有响，响则必应，
故云音声相和也。
Sound is utterance—when uttered, there is tone,
And tone must have echo, which must respond—
Thus it is said that sound and resonance harmonize.

且雷霆有声，不动不闻，
锺鼓有音，不击不鸣。
Even thunder’s sound, if unmovement remains, cannot be heard,
And bells’ tones, if not struck, will not ring.

《诗》云：嘤其鸣矣，犹求友声。
The *Book of Odes* says: *Ming! Ming!*—its call still seeks a harmonizing response.

《易》曰：呜鹤在阴，其子和之。
The *Yijing* says: *The wailing crane is in the shade—its offspring responds in harmony.*

此声响之相随，犹形之於影，
自然而并生，俱出而俱没也。
This is how sound and echo follow one another,
Like form and shadow—
Both arise naturally together,
And vanish as one.

夫音者，本无待於声也，
声发而响随之耳。
For resonance is not dependent on sound—
It is only when sound is emitted that echo follows.

如人言凶则气粗，声和则气悦，
爱人者人常爱之，敬人者人常敬之，
未尝不由己出，其犹音响之於鸣声，
此固然之理也。
When one speaks harshly, their *qi* grows coarse,
And when their voice is harmonious, their *qi* is pleasing—
Those who love others are often loved in return,
And those who honor others are often honored in turn.
This is never otherwise—
Just as echo follows utterance,
So too does this principle hold true.

前后之相随。
The interplay of before and after.

夫身行於前，影必随之后，
阳唱於前，阴必和於后。
For when the body moves forward, the shadow follows behind,
And when the Yang leads, the Yin must harmonize.

此影形相逐，阴阳相和，
前后相随，此则必然之理也。
This is how shadow chases form,
And Yin harmonizes with Yang—
Before and after follow one another—
This is the inevitable principle.

《孔丛子》曰：前譬之古也，后譬之今也。
The *Kong Congzi* says: Before is like the past,
And after is like the present.

古今相继，犹前后之相随，
初无间然也。
Past and present follow one another,
Just as before and after—
There is no separation.

澄明子曰：前者始条理也，后者终条理也。
The Sage Chengming said: Before is the beginning of order,
And after is its completion.

未闻有前而无后也，
亦未见有始而无终也。
I have never heard of a before without an after,
Nor seen a beginning without an end.

前后一理也，始终一贯也。
Before and after are one principle,
And beginning and end are a continuous thread.

不由於前而至於后者，天下无之。
There is nothing in the world that does not arise from before and reach after.

此大修行人初以无为居其前，
无不为必继之於后，
此自然之道也。
Thus, the great cultivator first abides in *wuwei* (non-action),
And *wuwei* must inevitably follow—
This is the Way of Nature.

是以圣人处无为之事。
Therefore, the Sage governs through *wuwei*.

圣人者，天下之至人也。
The Sage is the ultimate person in the world.

而曰处无为之事者，何哉？
Yet why is it said that the Sage governs through *wuwei*?

夫无为者，简易也。
For *wuwei* is simplicity.

盖圣人者德并二仪，
故参乾坤之理，而从於简易也。
The Sage’s virtue encompasses both Yang and Yin,
Thus they grasp the principles of Heaven and Earth,
And follow simplicity.

何以知之？
《易》曰：乾以易知，坤以简能。
How do we know this?
The *Yijing* says: *Heaven is known through ease, Earth through simplicity.*

易则易知，简则易从。
Ease is easy to understand,
And simplicity is easy to follow.

易知则有亲，易从则有功。
Ease to understand brings familiarity,
And simplicity to follow yields effectiveness.

有亲则可久，有功则可大。
Familiarity allows endurance,
And effectiveness allows greatness.

可久则贤人之德，可大则贤人之业。
Endurance is the virtue of the worthy,
And greatness is their accomplishment.

易简而天下之理得矣。
Through ease and simplicity, the world’s principles are attained.

此圣人之所以处无为之事也。

行不言之教。
To practice the teaching that does not speak.

夫不言者，忘言也。
For not speaking is forgetting speech.

盖忘言之中，至理存焉。
Within forgetting speech, the highest principles remain.

谓天下之理尽在不言之中，
故圣人得其奥理，默而行之，
故云行不言之教也。
For the world’s principles are entirely contained in not speaking—
Thus the Sage attains their profound essence,
And acts in silence,
Hence it is said: *To practice the teaching that does not speak.*

然夫不言之教，谓天道也，
盖天道不言而善应也。
Yet the teaching that does not speak refers to the Dao of Heaven—
For Heaven’s Dao does not speak yet responds with goodness.

孔子曰：天何言哉？
四时行焉，百物生焉。
天何言哉？
Is this not what Confucius said?
*Heaven speaks not—*
Yet the four seasons proceed in their order,
And all things flourish in their time.
*Heaven speaks not—*

是以圣人观天之道，执天之行，
故云行不言之教也。
Thus the Sage observes Heaven’s Dao,
And follows its actions,
Hence it is said: *To practice the teaching that does not speak.*

《易》曰：天生神物，圣人则之。
天地变化，圣人效之。
天垂象见吉凶，圣人象之。
河出图洛出书，圣人则之。
The *Yijing* says:
*Heaven births divine things—*
The Sage follows them.
*Heaven and Earth transform—*
The Sage imitates them.
*Heaven displays symbols to show auspiciousness and inauspiciousness—*
The Sage mirrors them.
*The Yellow River reveals its map,*
*The Luo River its script—*
The Sage follows them.

夫神物变化，吉凶图书，
亦未尝有言也，
而圣人则效法象，
斯非行不言之教之谓欤？」
For divine things and transformations,
And symbols of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness,
There is no speech—
Yet the Sage responds by imitating their forms,
Is this not the practice of the teaching that does not speak?

*The myriad things act yet do not claim their deeds.*
The *acting* refers to the creation and flourishing of all things.
The *not claiming* means humility, not self-praising.
The *Zhongyong* says:
*Great indeed is the Sage’s Dao,*
*Vast and towering, reaching to Heaven.*

The *Yijing* says:
*The Sage acts,*
*And all things observe.*

Yet never has it been heard that the Sage boasts of his abilities.
As in the past, when Zongni (Confucius) traced the lineage of Yao and Shun,
And established the constitutional models of Wen and Wu,
He aligned himself above with Heaven’s timing,
And below followed Earth’s nurturing,
Like Heaven and Earth in their boundless sustaining and covering,
Like the four seasons in their orderly succession,
Like the sun and moon in their alternating brilliance,
All things flourishing together yet not harming one another,
The Dao running parallel yet never conflicting.

The lesser virtue flows like a river,
The greater virtue deeply transforms.
Thus his disciples said:
*"Is our Master a Sage?*
*How vast his abilities!"*

Confucius replied:
*"A Sage? That I cannot be."*
This is the humble self-effacement,
The *not claiming* of which we speak.

*He gives birth yet does not possess.*
The *giving birth* is the name of *ren* (virtue).
How so? Does not the *Yijing* say:
*"Endless, ceaseless birth—*
*This is called virtue."*

The *not possessing* means the Sage does not hoard his virtue for himself.
Former scholars said:
*"One may let all under Heaven benefit from the Sage’s virtue,*
*But not let them know of the Sage’s virtue.*
*To let them benefit and know—*
*This is the lesser virtue.*
*To have a method that can be debated—*
*This is the lesser virtue.*
*To let them benefit from the Sage’s sevenfold virtue yet remain unaware,*
*This is the greater virtue."*

*Without trace yet named—*
This is the Sage’s teaching of *giving birth yet not possessing*.

*The Sage does yet does not rely.*
The Sage is one of many talents and arts,
Yet never does he claim them as his own,
Hence it is said: *to do yet not rely*.

In the past, Yangzi (Yang Zhu) asked the Old Master (Laozi) of the Sage’s governance.
The Old Master replied:
*"The Sage’s governance,*
*Its power covers all under Heaven,*
*Yet appears not to act from himself.*
*Its transformation benefits all things,*
*Yet the people do not rely upon it.*
*There is no one to praise its name,*
*Yet things rejoice in their own accord.*
*He stands in the unfathomable,*
*Yet wanders in the boundless.*
*This is the teaching of doing yet not relying."*

Is this not the same principle?
*When deeds are accomplished, he does not dwell upon them—*
Thus it is said: *he does not depart*.

The *not dwelling* means he does not boast of his deeds.
The *not departing* means his name endures.
Again, it is said:
*The not dwelling is self-retreat.*
Indeed, when deeds are accomplished and the body retreats,
Then his virtue is lasting,
And his name is renowned.
Hence it is said: *his name does not depart*.

The Classics state:
*"Deeds accomplished, name secured,*
*Yet the body retreats—*
*This is Heaven’s Dao."*

As in the past, when Yu (the Great) tamed the waters and settled the land,
Shun (the Sage) passed the Mandate of Heaven to him,
Yet Yu declined in favor of Shun’s son, Shangjun (Kang Yu),
And withdrew to Yangcheng (the City of the Sun),
This was *accomplishing deeds yet not dwelling*.
And all under Heaven followed him—
This was *his name not departing*.

Is this not what is meant?

Zhuangzi’s *Inner Chapters* says: *"All under Heaven knows this, yet it does not depart."* Beauty lies within oneself, not in others. Goodness lies within oneself, not in others. Now, if one accumulates a single beauty yet desires all under Heaven to know it, then it is no longer beauty; if one performs a single good deed yet desires all under Heaven to know it, then it is no longer goodness.

The affairs of the world have opposites—what exists has its nonexistent counterpart, what is difficult has its easy counterpart, what is long has its short counterpart, what is high has its low counterpart. They generate and complete each other, contrast and incline toward each other, like echoes responding to sound, shadows following form.

The Sage encompasses all with effortless spontaneity. His actions are without contrivance, his teachings without words. Like Heaven, he nurtures all things without toil, with life’s function yet no trace of creation, with deeds yet no claim to labor. Our Master said: *"Only Heaven is great, only Yao followed it."* Broad and boundless, the people cannot name it.

The Sage follows Heaven’s Way by accomplishing deeds yet not dwelling upon them. At its utmost, goodness accumulates and his name becomes renowned; virtue shines and his person is honored. He does not seek fame, yet fame follows him. Though he wished to depart from it, how could he depart?

The Master of Chu’s Retreat said: *"Those who possess what they possess cannot truly possess it; those who lack what they possess can truly possess it."* This is truly speaking to the heart’s essence.

The character *去* (départ) is read as in *"the noble departs from benevolence."*

The ancient scholars said: *"If one seeks virtue yet avoids fame, then there are no deeds worth doing under Heaven. The Sage has intent in doing good yet no intent in gaining fame, yet fame cannot ultimately be made to depart—just as sound harmonizes with sound, and form follows shadow."*

When read from beginning to end, the entire chapter’s meaning flows together like a pulse, its threads interconnected. It concludes by reiterating: *"Only because he does not dwell upon it, it does not depart."* This is not merely a marvel of composition but a profound teaching for humanity.

Xu Liu said: *"All under Heaven knows this, yet it does not depart"*—the meaning echoes throughout.

Wealth is the root of misfortune, and joy the source of sorrow; this is the natural order. None can perceive it, so the Sage, moved by pity for the world’s ignorance, declares: *"All under Heaven knows beauty and goodness, rushing toward and delighting in them, yet does not know that evil and harm arise from them."*

This principle is like the generation of having and lacking, the completion of difficulty and ease, the contrast of length and shortness, the inclination of high and low, the harmony of sound and echo, the succession of before and after. From ancient times to now, all things and affairs have their opposites, like an endless ring.

Only the Sage stands alone, without counterpart. Thus the Sage dwells in non-action, yet it does not depart.

Only the Sage stands independent, with no opposing counterpart. For he dwells in non-action, practices teaching without words.

Non-action is not inaction—it means following nature’s spontaneity, responding without contrivance, and thus achieving harmony.

Teaching without words is not mere silence—it means sincere inner cultivation and loyal, trustworthy outward conduct. The world follows him without effort or expenditure. Though he daily responds to myriad affairs, he leads yet does not initiate, so he does not weary of labor—hence it is said: *"He acts yet does not claim the deed."* The people are nourished by his care alone, with no personal gain—hence it is said: *"He gives life yet does not possess."* He establishes deeds and fulfills his role, acting only as duty demands, without boasting of his own ability—hence it is said: *"He acts yet does not rely upon it."* When deeds are accomplished and affairs settled, he retreats and yields his position—hence it is said: *"He accomplishes deeds yet does not dwell upon them."*

Only thus, by following Heaven’s Dao, is his person preserved and his deeds enduring. Therefore, his fame is praised across ten thousand generations without ceasing. Hence it is said: *"It does not depart."*

*Zhiyi’s* *Collected Remnants* says: *"Having and lacking generate each other, just as there must be low if there is high. Thus, though having and lacking differ, both ultimately escape the realm of mere possession."* This speaks to the forms of things, borrowing the contrast of having and lacking to illustrate it.

Guang [commentary] says: *"These six pairs are why things are unequal; only those who lose their counterparts can achieve harmony."*

From *Cross-Referencing the Masters*:
*The Master Zhuang* says: *"The Dao can be weak yet strong, soft yet hard, yin yet yang, hidden yet manifest, encompassing Heaven and Earth, responding without measure. To know shallowly is to not know deeply; to know externally is to not know internally; to know coarsely is to not know finely. To know is to not know; to not know is to know. Who knows that knowing is not knowing, and not knowing is knowing? The Dao cannot be heard—hearing it is false. The Dao cannot be seen—seeing it is false. The Dao cannot be spoken—speaking it is false. Who knows the formless form?*

*"Therefore, all under Heaven knows goodness as goodness, yet it is no longer goodness. The wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise."*

Shi Tan said: *"All under Heaven knows beauty as beauty, yet it is already evil. All know goodness as goodness, yet it is no longer goodness."*

Thus, having and lacking generate each other, difficulty and ease complete each other, length and shortness contrast each other, high and low incline toward each other, sound harmonizes with sound, before follows after. Beauty and evil, goodness and harm, having and lacking, difficulty and ease, length and shortness, high and low—all are relative terms without fixed names.

When there is beauty, there is evil in opposition; when there is goodness, there is harm in opposition. Hence it is said: *"All under Heaven knows beauty as beauty, yet it is already evil; all know goodness as goodness, yet it is no longer goodness."*

When it comes to having, there is lacking in opposition; having difficulty, there is ease in opposition; having length, there is shortness in opposition; having height, there is lowliness in opposition. Thus, they generate and complete each other, contrast and incline toward each other.

Yet these are all opposites, but as for sound and sequence, they are not starkly opposed, yet why are they included as well? Truly, the Way in which they generate and complete each other, contrast and incline toward each other, is also like the harmonization of sound and the following of sequence—this is the natural principle.

This further illustrates that even what does not seem opposite is used to describe what must be opposite. Therefore, the Sage handles the affairs of *wuwei* (無為, non-action), and practices the teaching of *busheng* (不言, non-speech).

*Wuwei* and *busheng* are both means to embody the Dao’s *wu ming* (無名, namelessness). With names come action and speech. Since the Dao has no name, what need is there for speech and action?

Thus, it transcends the realm of beauty and evil, goodness and harm. Only in *wuwei* and *busheng* can beauty even be named—what of evil? Only in *wuwei* and *busheng* can goodness be named—what of harm?

All things arise, yet the Sage does not claim them; they are born, yet the Sage does not possess them. Act without relying upon it; when the work is done, do not dwell upon it.

All things arise, yet I do not claim them—let them arise. They are born, yet I do not possess them—I though give birth to them, yet never claim that they are mine to give birth to.

Act without relying upon it—I act through *wuwei* (non-action), yet never rely upon what I have done. When the work is done, I do not dwell upon it—though I give birth to them, it cannot be said that I have no merit, yet I do not dwell upon that merit.

Thus, though I am beautiful, others do not know me as such; though I am good, others do not know me as such.

Only by not dwelling upon it does its essence remain. If one dwells upon it, it departs. If I dwell upon my beauty, when beauty’s name departs, it becomes evil. If I dwell upon my goodness, when goodness’s name departs, it becomes harm.

Only by handling the affairs of *wuwei* (non-action), practicing the teaching of *busheng* (non-speech), acting without claiming, giving birth without possessing, acting without relying upon it, and completing the work without dwelling upon it—thus, its name does not depart.

Its name does not depart, then it is my name. This passage elaborates upon the previous meaning of *wu ming* (namelessness).

*Dao De Jing Ji Yi* (道德真经集义, *The Collected Meanings of the Dao De Jing*) Volume Six concludes. Volume Seven begins.

「Master Yinyuan of the Concentrated Dao/Way’s profound and mysterious *De* (virtue/power) is always present.

*Liu Weiyong*, who oversees the affairs of the *Xuanmiao Guan* (Mysterious Marvels Hall), has compiled this text.

*Ding Yidong*, in his capacity as a *delong* (editor) of the *Jushimi Yuan* (Office of the Imperial Secretariat) and a *taifu shi bu* (official of the Bureau of Finance) in the previous dynasty, has verified it.

**Chapter on Not Esteeming the Virtuous (不尚贤章):**
*Considerations of Differences (考异):* The *Master of the Yellow River* (河上公) composed *The Chapter on the Mysterious Transformation of the Alone-Evolved* (至神独化义章), while *Zhao Shizhu* (赵实庵) authored *The Chapter on the Mysterious Transformation of the Alone-Evolved* (至神独化义章) and *The Chapter on Pacifying the People* (安民章).

*Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang* (唐明皇) expounded: In the previous chapter, it was made clear that the myriad transformations return to the root, and the Dao/Way’s virtuous transformation is illuminated. In this chapter, it is made clear that the noble and esteemed are not to be relied upon, and *wuwei* (non-action) leads to the ultimate principle.

First, it is stated that one should not esteem the virtuous, thereby severing the traces of arrogance and partiality. Next, the *saintly principle* (圣理) is mentioned, demonstrating the method of establishing the teaching, concluding with *wuwei* (non-action) to show that transformation is complete yet returns to simplicity.

*Du Guangting* (杜光庭) said: The great sage establishes the principle, while the virtuous assist it. How can they be like fish and water without relying upon each other? From the sovereign of the Five Phases (二五之主) down to the tyrant-king (霸王之君), those who open states and establish their foundations depend upon the virtuous as their basis.

The phrase "not esteeming" (不尚) refers to the conduct of arrogance and boasting. If the virtuous are employed, the people will naturally govern themselves; if boasting is employed, grievances and conflicts will arise. Not esteeming boasting will naturally eliminate grievances and conflicts, and not valuing rare and precious goods will make the people without covetousness or theft—thus aligning with the saintly, and with the Dao/Way’s *xuzi* (emptiness), *wuzhi* (non-knowing), and *wuyu* (non-desire), fulfilling the principle of not esteeming.

*Zhang Chongying* (张冲应) replied: "Pacifying" (安) means "governing" (治), and "people" (民) refers to "humanity" (人). This chapter speaks of how rulers and great officials reflect upon the Dao/Way, nurturing their own selves, and thus their upright actions and virtuous influence will follow. If the people take *wuwei* (non-action) as their foundation, there will be none who are not governed and pacified.

Not esteeming the virtuous prevents the people from striving in conflict. Not valuing rare and difficult-to-obtain goods prevents the people from becoming thieves.»

If desirable things are unseen, the heart will not be disturbed.
Thus, the saintly governance
empties the heart,
fills the belly,
weakens the will,
strengthens the bones,
ever keeping the people in *wuzhi* (non-knowing) and *wuyu* (non-desire),
so that even the wise dare not act.

To act with *wuwei* (non-action)
is to ensure nothing remains ungoverned.

**Variants:**
*"Heart"* (心) in *"heart will not be disturbed"* (使心不乱) was originally *"people’s heart"* (民心) in ancient texts.
*"Nothing remains ungoverned"* (无不治) was rendered as *"nothing remains undone"* (无不为) by Fu Yue (傅奕) and Sun Deng (孙登), matching the ancient version.

**He Shang Gong (河上公) said:**
*"Not esteeming the virtuous"* (不尚贤) refers to those virtuous in the eyes of the world—
eloquent in speech, skilled in rhetoric, yet detached from the Dao/Way, prioritizing artifice over substance.
*"Not esteeming"* means neither rewarding them with office nor wealth.
Thus, the people will not strive in contention.
*"Not contending"* clarifies the return to natural simplicity.
*"Not valuing rare goods"* means the ruler does not hoard precious treasures—
gold abandoned in mountains, pearls cast into depths.
Thus, the people will not steal.
With the ruler’s purity above, none below will be greedy.

*"Desirable things unseen"* means abandoning licentious music and distant beauties,
so the heart remains undisturbed.
No licentiousness, no confusion.

Thus, the saintly governance—
governing the nation and nurturing the self are one.

*"Empty the heart"* means eliminating cravings, dispelling chaos.
*"Fill the belly"* means embracing the Dao/Way, holding to unity, guarding the Five Spirits.
*"Weaken the will"* means gentle, yielding, and humble—never seizing power.
*"Strengthen the bones"* means cherishing essence, moderating exertion, ensuring marrow fills and bones harden.
Ever keeping the people in *wuzhi* (non-knowing) and *wuyu* (non-desire),
returning to simplicity, guarding purity.

Thus, even the wise dare not act—
for deep thought prevents reckless speech.
To act with *wuwei* (non-action)
is to move without contrivance, following natural course,
and thus nothing remains ungoverned.
With virtue’s influence profound, the people dwell in peace.

**Wang Fu Si (王辅嗣) said:**
From *"not esteeming the virtuous"* to *"the heart will not be disturbed"*—
*"Virtuous"* means capable, *"esteeming"* is praise by name, *"valuing"* is exaltation by title.
If only capability is rewarded, why bestow praise and honor?
Exalting the virtuous for fame alone, their glory exceeding their worth,
the people will rush to compete, their abilities vying in rivalry.
Wealth beyond use will tempt the greedy to steal, risking life for plunder.
Thus, if desirable things are unseen, the heart will not be disturbed.

Therefore, the saintly governance truly *"fills the belly"*—
the heart holds wisdom, the belly sustains life;
empty of wisdom, yet full of nourishment.

*"Weaken the will, strengthen the bones"*—
bones without knowledge remain sturdy,
while the will, when unrestrained, breeds chaos.
Ever keeping the people in *wuzhi* (non-knowing) and *wuyu* (non-desire),
they guard their true nature.

Thus, even the wise dare not act—
*"the wise"* refers to those who act.
And so nothing remains ungoverned.

**Tang Ming Huang (唐明皇) said:**
*"Not esteeming the virtuous"* prevents contention.
Exalting the virtuous leaves traces—
those who follow them will contend.
If the virtuous and unvirtuous each fulfill their roles,
there will be no contention.

**Commentary (疏):**
*"Esteeming"* means elevating in status.
*"Virtuous"* means talent and ability.
The ruler’s exaltation of ability leaves traces;
following these traces loses authenticity,
and losing authenticity is the root of esteeming the virtuous.
Contention arises from clinging to these traces—
better than the Dao’s mysterious transformation,
assigning *wuwei* (non-action),
letting the people follow naturally—
clouds obey the dragon, winds follow the tiger.
Then, even in the reign of Tang Yao (唐尧),
there will be no shortage of worthy ministers like Yuan Kai (元凯);
I Lu (伊吕) ascending to office,
fulfilling the hopes of the people.
Each in their proper place, none coveting more,
and thus there is no contention.

**Original Text Translation:**

Do not esteem rare and difficult-to-obtain goods,
so the people will not become thieves.

Rare and difficult-to-obtain goods refer to what lies beyond one’s natural endowment.
To seek what cannot be had is futile—thus they are called difficult to obtain.
He who does not rest in his natural allotment,
but covets what he lacks,
has already strayed from his nature—
how can this not be theft?

Let things be used according to their nature,
and let actions accord with one’s abilities,
then rare and difficult-to-obtain goods will lose their allure,
and the essence of life will not be stolen.

**Commentary (疏):**
Humans, upon receiving life, are endowed with a natural portion.
The materials and faculties they inherit are their own body and treasure.
To seek beyond one’s allotment is futile—
thus they are called difficult to obtain.

If one does not abide by his nature,
but aspires to brilliance beyond his endowment,
he loses his true essence
and becomes a thief by private inclination.

Now, if the wise and foolish follow their natural inclinations,
and abilities align with their capacities,
with no desire to exceed their portion,
they will naturally disregard rare and difficult-to-obtain goods,
for they are already content with what they possess—
who would then be a thief?

Thus, Zhuangzi said:
*"The unvirtuous steal the essence of life and glut themselves on wealth and honor."*

It is also explained:
If the ruler does not esteem pearls, rhinoceros horn, or precious gems,
his governance will be pure and tranquil,
and the people, transformed by this, will naturally abandon greed.
Each knowing their sufficiency,
they will not become thieves.

Do not present what is desirable,
so the heart remains undisturbed.

Since there is no pursuit of the virtuous nor coveting of rare goods,
there is nothing visibly desirable to incite confusion in the heart.

**Commentary (疏):**
To aspire to brilliance is to see what is desirable—
when desire stirs, how can the heart not be disturbed?
Now, if one neither elevates ability nor seeks beyond his portion,
there will be nothing desirable to provoke confusion in the heart.

Thus, the Sage’s governance.

**Commentary (疏):**
This speaks of the Sage’s governance over the realm and self,
establishing it as the foundation of teaching.
What more is there to governance of the realm?
Only governance of the self.

Thus, empty the heart and fill the belly,
cut off desire and forget knowledge in *wuwei*,
and nothing will remain ungoverned.

Empty the heart.
When the heart is not disturbed by what is desirable, it is empty.

**Commentary (疏):**
To labor the mind after external things is to be obscured by worldly affairs,
but to cultivate stillness and preserve purity is to let desires not arise—
when desires do not arise, the heart is empty.
Zhuangzi said: *"An empty room gives birth to white."*—
meaning that when the heart is empty, pure clarity arises naturally.

Thus it is said:
Empty the heart, fill the belly,
let virtue and power internally suffuse—
then there will be no arrogance or contrivance,
just as one who eats until satisfied will stop,
generating no further greed.

**Commentary (疏):**
The belly, when full, does not crave more;
when virtue and power internally suffuse,
no greed arises—
thus it is said, *fill the belly*.
*"Eating until satisfied and stopping"* comes from the *Spring and Autumn Annals*,
where Yan Mo and Ru Kuang advised Duke Wuzi of Wei:
*"Use the belly of a commoner to govern the heart of a noble—
when satisfied, there will be no further greed."*

Weaken the will.
When the heart is empty, the will grows weak.

**Commentary (疏):**
The will is the mind’s affair—
when the mind has something to act upon, it is called will.
To let the mind adhere to gentleness and weakness is to know
that when the heart is empty, the will weakens.

Strengthen the bones.
When the belly is full, the bones grow strong.

**Commentary (疏):**
The bones are the body’s framework.
Since virtue and power internally suffuse,
and there is no greed,
the belly remains full—
when the belly is full, the bones grow strong.

Always let the people be without knowledge and without desire.
Always let them lack the knowledge of contention and esteem,
and the desire for acquisition.

**Commentary (疏):**
The Sage’s teaching of emptying the heart and filling the belly
seeks to make the people naturally free from the knowledge of contention
and the desire for acquisition,
so they may transform on their own.

Let those who know dare not act.
Through tranquil transformation, when knowledge and desire are exhausted,
even those who possess knowledge will not dare to act.

**Commentary (疏):**
Those without knowledge and desire are already tranquil—
thus, those who possess knowledge will gradually be refined by pure transformation,
daring not to act in pursuit of traces or greed,
but instead practicing *wuwei*.

To act in *wuwei* is to govern perfectly.

To act in *wuwei* while letting people return to their nature,
pure transformation will naturally ensue.

**Commentary (疏):**
To act while abiding in *wuwei*—
even if acting, it is still *wuwei*.
Since the pursuit of the virtuous is abandoned,
and rare goods are not sought,
people follow their natural portions,
and things retain their authenticity—
in *wuwei*, what is there to arrogate or contrive?
Though without fame or repute,
people do not recognize it,
yet who can say the pure wind does not prevail?

Du Guangting said:
*"Not esteeming the virtuous prevents contention.*
*Pursuing traces*—this means artificiality.
Once the principle of esteeming the virtuous arises,
artificial men will inevitably appear.
Why? Because the virtuous are difficult to discern.
The cunning feign trustworthiness,
the flatterers feign loyalty—
how easy is it to distinguish them?

The *Classic* says:
*'Wisdom produces great deceit.'*
Thus, when the ruler values wisdom,
the people respond with deceit;
when the ruler values the virtuous,
the people respond with artificiality.
It is better to rectify oneself and lead by example,
governing through *wuwei*,
nurturing with the Great Harmony,
transforming through tranquility—
then worthy ministers will naturally serve their roles.

This is what is meant by *clouds following the dragon, winds following the tiger*.
Clouds follow the dragon and winds follow the tiger—
this is Confucius’ interpretation of the *Book of Changes*’ *Qian* hexagram,
where the fifth line says: *The flying dragon in the sky.*
Since it can broadly influence all things,
water flows to dampness,
fire turns to dryness,
clouds follow the dragon,
winds follow the tiger.
Each follows its kind, responding naturally—
this illustrates the Son of Heaven ascending to the fifth position,
and all under heaven coming to his court.

The Sage acts, and all things behold him—
those rooted in Heaven turn upward,
those rooted in Earth turn downward.
This speaks of water, which is yin—
when flowing on Earth, it seeks dampness.
Fire, which is yang—
when burning wood, it seeks dryness.
Though these two things lack awareness or sentiment,
they are moved by *qi* and respond thus.
Again, the dragon is a water creature,
and clouds are water *qi*—
when the dragon roars, mist rises.
The tiger is a fierce beast,
and wind is a moving force—
when the tiger howls, valley winds arise.
These two things, though possessing awareness and sentiment,
share the same *qi* and kind as those without—
thus they respond in the same way.

「When the Sage descends into the world, the flying dragon soars through Heaven,
and the worthy and virtuous support one another—
all things respond in harmony, thus expanding their influence.

Emperor Yao of the Tang dynasty, surnamed Yiqi and named Fangxun,
was known as Emperor Tao of the Tang clan.

Emperor Shun of the Yu clan,
a descendant of Zhuanyu, grandson of Qiaoniu,
son of Guying, born to Mother Yuleng at Yaochu,
was thus surnamed Yao and named Zhonghua.

The eight **Yuan** and eight **Kai** were his ministers.
In ancient times, the High Xin (尧) clan had eight talented sons:
Bo Feng, Zhong Kan, Shu Xian, Ji Zhong,
Bo Hu, Zhong Xiong, Shu Bao, Ji Li—
loyal, solemn, reverent, and harmonious,
spreading benevolence and grace—
the people of all under Heaven called them the eight **Yuan**.

The High Yang (舜) clan had eight talented sons:
Cang Shu, Tui Gu, Dao Jie, Dai Lin,
Long Jiang, Ting Jian, Zhong Rong, Shu Da—
virtuous and broad-minded, wise and sincere—
the people of all under Heaven called them the eight **Kai**.

These sixteen clans united in their excellence,
and their renown did not fade.
Yet Yao did not trust them,
and instead raised Shun as his minister,
appointed the eight **Yuan** to propagate the Five Teachings to the four quarters,
and assigned the eight **Kai** to govern the **Hou Tu** (后土, the Earthly Realm).

The **Tai** and **Heng** (台衡) were the expectations of the Son of Heaven—
he established the Three Ministers (三公) to symbolize the Three **Tai** (台, celestial palaces).
He did not value rare and difficult treasures,
so the people did not become thieves.

Human life originates from the vital essence of Heaven and Earth,
and those who receive the clear, bright, and pure *qi* become Sages and worthy ones,
while those who receive the turbid, stagnant, and confused *qi* become foolish and lowly.
The Sages and worthy ones possess vast divine intelligence,
while the foolish and dim-witted are clouded in ignorance.
Thus, there are inherent differences in human nature.

Laozi said to Confucius:
*"The Way generates people and all things,
and birds, beasts, insects, and all creatures have their odd and even—
this refers to differing *qi*.
But common people do not know its nature,
only those who grasp Dao and virtue can trace its origin."*

The *Wenzi* (文子) says:
*"Clear *qi* is Heaven, turbid *qi* is Earth,
harmonious *qi* is humanity.
Within harmonious *qi*, there is brightness and darkness—
thus, there are the worthy and the foolish.
If the foolish seek to emulate the worthy, they exceed their nature—
this is called *yue fen* (越分, transgressing one’s limits).
If the dark seek to replace the bright, they make false demands—
this is called *mang qiu* (妄求, presumptuous desire).
This is the act of stealing the essence of life
and greedily coveting wealth and honor—
words from the *Zhuangzi*’s *‘Pianmu’* (骈拇, ‘Extra Thumbs’) chapter."*

Wealth and honor are coveted because they can be seized,
but when there is no higher path to aspire to,
people accept their lot,
acting according to their ability and receiving tasks accordingly—
how much less would they transgress their limits
to greedily steal what is not their due!

A ruler does not value pearls, rhinoceros horns, or rare treasures—
this prevents the people from becoming thieves.
He does not display what is desirable,
so his heart remains undisturbed.
To covet and admire is to envy brilliance.

Human nature is limited,
yet to envy wisdom is to transgress one’s nature—
this is called *desire* (欲).

Again, those who cultivate the Dao,
in their early stages,
though their practice is incomplete,
their refinement not yet mature,
fear what is desirable,
being drawn by the realm of phenomena—
thus, they retreat into mountains and forests,
avoiding the clamor of the world.
But when their hearts are tranquil and their wills steadfast,
the realm cannot entice them—
they move through the day with ease,
never wearying.
This is the saying:
*"Small retreat in the mountains, great retreat in the marketplace."*

Unable to sever desire,
fearing the pull of phenomena,
they hide in mountains and forests to avoid what they see—
until their hearts are purified and their thoughts still,
their minds dwell on the true and genuine,
free from external disturbances,
preserving inner serenity—
even amidst the bustling markets,
name and gain do not touch their hearts;
even amidst the worldly paths,
controversies do not disrupt their intentions.
Mingling with the city,
how does this harm the cultivation of the genuine?

Thus, the Sage’s principle:
*"The True and Perfect Man said to the Yellow Emperor:
‘I have never heard of a man who cultivates his body
yet fails to bring order to his state.’
The body of one man is a microcosm of his state—
the chest and abdomen are like palaces and halls,
the four limbs like boundaries and territories,
the bones and joints like officials.
The spirit is like the ruler,
the blood like the ministers,
and the *qi* like the people.
To govern the body is to govern the state—
loving the people secures the state,
cherishing the *qi* preserves the body.
If the people scatter, the state falls;
if the *qi* is exhausted, life dies.
What has fallen cannot be restored,
what is dead cannot be revived—
thus, the Perfect Man extinguishes breath before it arises,
and treats ailments before they manifest.
*Qi* is difficult to nurture yet easily corrupted,
the people are hard to gather yet easily dispersed—
governance must begin before chaos arises,
not after it has already passed."*

**Reflect upon this!**

**Empty your heart.**
Only when the Dao gathers in emptiness does emptiness embrace the Dao.
When the Dao gathers in the heart,
the spirit plays with transformation,
the heart communicates with Heaven,
and all things spontaneously transform below—
the Sage rests in harmony above.
This is the ultimate principle of governance.

*"The empty room produces whiteness"*—
words from the *Zhuangzi*’s *‘Renjian Shijie’* (人间世, ‘The World of Man’) chapter.
The room is the heart—
to see what is present as if it were absent is to empty the heart.
When the heart is emptied,
pure whiteness naturally arises.
Pure whiteness is the appearance of great clarity and openness.

The *Inner Observation Scripture* (内观经) says:
*"The heart is neither green nor red,
neither white nor yellow,
neither long nor short,
neither round nor square—
it encompasses Heaven and Earth,
yet enters the finest hairs.
Restrain it, and it ceases;
release it, and it runs wild.
Calmness and stillness bring life,
turbulence and agitation bring death.
It illuminates the eight directions,
or it confuses even one corner.
Humanity’s greatest difficulty lies in the heart—
thus, teaching people to cultivate the Dao is to teach them to cultivate the heart.
Teaching people to cultivate the heart is to teach them the Dao.
The heart cannot be stilled,
but through the Dao it is stilled;
the heart cannot be seen,
but through the Dao it is illuminated.
The dual paths of good and evil,
all worldly laws arise from the heart and perish in the heart—
those who practice the Dao still the heart and attain the Dao,
while the common folk indulge the heart and endanger themselves."*

The heart gives rise to chaos, its extinction brings order—
thus the Son of Heaven establishes officials,
clarifies laws and punishments,
sets rewards and calamities,
and hangs omens of fortune and misfortune,
all to guide humanity—
for these are measures against the heart’s unruliness.

The heartless are without commandments,
the steadfast-hearted are without doubt,
the still-hearted act not at all,
the restrained-hearted are not disordered,
the rectified-hearted are not perverse,
the purified-hearted are not defiled,
the empty-hearted are not attached.

To grasp these seven principles,
one may speak of the Dao,
one may speak of cultivating the heart.

Fill the belly.

The heart’s desires are boundless,
the belly’s capacity is sufficient.
The heart is boundless, so empty it.
The belly is sufficient, so fill it.
An empty heart gives rise to no cravings,
a full belly halts greed of its own accord.

Cherish loyalty and sincerity,
embrace simplicity and purity—
thus virtue is complete within.

*The *Chūnqiū* is the name of the annals of Lǔ.
When Yán Mò and Rǔ Kuān remonstrated,
it was in the twenty-eighth year of Duke Zāo of *Chūnqiū*,
when Wèi Xiànzǐ of Jìn, Shū by name,
held office and appointed his son Wù as Great Officer of Gěngyáng—
now Jìnyáng.
In winter, there was a case in Gěngyáng,
and Wù could not decide it,
so he brought the matter before Xiànzǐ.

The plaintiff’s elder, with female musicians as tribute,
intended to give them to Wèi Zǐ.
Wù said to the two ministers Yán Mò and Rǔ Kuān:
*"Our lord is renowned among the thousand lords for his refusal of bribes—
yet to accept tribute from Gěngyáng would be the height of greed.
My lords must remonstrate!"*
Both agreed.

After the court audience, he awaited them in the hall. The tribute was presented, and Wèi Xiànzǐ summoned the two ministers to dine. When the food was served, he sighed three times. After eating, he had them sit.

Wèi Xiànzǐ said, *"I have heard from my elder kinsmen that there is a saying: 'Only when eating does one forget worries.' When my lords placed the food before me, they sighed three times. Why is this?"*

They answered with identical words: *"When others gave the two lesser men wine, they did not eat at night, and when the wine arrived, they feared it might not be enough—thus the first sigh. In the middle of the meal, they reproached themselves, saying, 'Should the General’s food be deemed insufficient?'—thus the second sigh. When the tribute was fully presented, they wished that their own bellies might serve as the virtuous mind of a noble one, and they prayed earnestly for it to cease—thus the third sigh."*

Wèi Xiànzǐ declined the tribute from Gěngyáng.

*Sprinkled* is the word for posthumous title. The *Chūnqiū* records: *"Wù Zǐ, whose given name was Wèi, was posthumously titled Wù."* The two ministers, Yán Mò and Rǔ Kuān, remonstrated with Wù Zǐ, wishing that their own bellies might serve as the virtuous mind of a noble one. The belly is easily filled, yet the mind is hard to satisfy—this was their desire to curb his greed and not accept the tribute from Gěngyáng. Even when lesser men’s bellies are full, they still know to stop; how much more should a noble one’s mind be content!

The *Chūnqiū* praised this act.

The Wèi clan’s rise was due to their accepting remonstrance. Their resolve was weakened.

The *Shī Xù* states: *"What arises in the heart is called resolve."* What the heart gives rise to is resolve; what it acts upon is deed. If the heart is soft and yielding, then there will be no reckless, hasty, or contentious affairs—all will be in harmony.

Harmony in affairs is the foundation of governance. Strengthen their bones.

If their resolve is weakened, then their virtue and gentleness will not be sullied by external temptations. If their bones are strengthened, then their firmness and preparedness will be rooted within. Those who follow the Dao will have sinews and bones that are strong and resilient—no hundred maladies can invade them.

A full belly strengthens the bones; the harmonious *qi* is abundant. In governing the realm, clear administration brings peace to the people, and frugal expenditures ensure their strength is plentiful.

Peaceful people are those whose resolve is weakened. Abundant strength is those whose bones are strengthened. Always let the people be without knowledge or desire.

Greed and avarice give rise to strife; knowledge sparks action.

The strife and desires being absent, clarity and tranquility will naturally manifest. Let those who possess knowledge dare not act.

When the lower follows the upper, it is like the wind bending the grass—pure and harmonious, universally permeating, all returning to the state of *non-action*. To act in *non-action* is to have nothing left ungoverned.

The principle of *non-action* is vast indeed! *Non-action* does not mean withdrawing so that nothing comes, or pushing so that nothing stays, or forcing so that there is no response, or moving so that nothing shifts, or being rigid and stagnant so that nothing flows, or being coiled and damp so that nothing scatters.

It means that private desires do not intrude upon the public Dao, that appetites do not pervert proper methods. To act in accordance with principle, to establish merit through resources, to complete deeds without self-praise, to achieve feats without claiming renown—this is *non-action*.

If water is used with a boat, sand with a cart, mud with a sled, and mountains with a wheelbarrow, if one cultivates summer fields and winter ponds, follows elevation for tillage and depression for reservoirs, then this is not what I call *action*—it is *non-action*.

The *non-action* of the Sage follows naturally, relies upon the people, demands without toil, plans without error, acts without omission. Their words are refined as writings, their deeds as models, their advancement and retreat suit the times, their movement and stillness follow principle. They neither favor beauty nor detest ugliness, nor do their rewards and punishments stem from personal likes or dislikes. Each has their own appointed name, each fulfills their own proper function. Matters arise from nature itself, without deviation from the self. They conform to Heaven’s timing, adapt to Earth’s traits, and follow humanity’s inclinations.

Thus, ministers gather like spokes to a wheel, the worthy and unworthy each employing their talents. The ruler gains means to govern his ministers, the ministers gain means to serve their ruler—this is the Dao of *non-action* in governing the realm.

The unheard and unscented is the *Shijing* [Book of Songs]—[大雅] [Great Odes]—[文王篇] [Wenwang’s Chapter]. It speaks of Heaven’s Dao being difficult to know: the ears do not hear its sounds, the nose does not perceive its fragrances. If one follows the rituals of Wenwang, then the world will naturally trust and comply.

The unrecognized and unknown is the *Shijing*—[大雅] [Great Odes]—[皇矣篇] [Huangyi’s Chapter]. It speaks of those who do not acknowledge the past nor comprehend the present, yet act in accordance with Heaven’s laws.

This says that Heaven’s Dao values sincerity, esteems nature’s essence, and does not exalt the worthy nor hold wealth in high regard—this aligns with it.

The Song emperor Daozong said: *"Not exalting the worthy leads to the people not becoming thieves."* Exalting the worthy brings many who know, to the point where the world is greatly alarmed, and Confucianists and Mohists all rise up. Valuing wealth brings many desires, to the point where daylight thefts occur, and robbers lurk even at midday.

Not exalting the worthy means the people each settle into their own appointed nature and fate, without striving to surpass others, hence they do not contend.

Not valuing wealth means the people each find contentment in their own natural inclinations and fates, without coveting what they do not possess, hence they do not become thieves.

Zhuangzi said: *"Trim the deeds of the Ru historians, and muzzle the mouths of Yang and Mo."*

The virtue/power of the world thus begins to return to its original unity.

*The Traveling Wolf* says: *"Do not exalt the strange and devalue the useful; only then will the people be content. Do not show them what is desirable, lest their hearts be disordered."*

When people have desires, they will even contest their very nature and fate—plundering, deceiving, and committing every outrage. Boyi, seeing the allure of fame, starved to death beneath Chief Yang’s hill; Zhi, seeing the lure of profit, met his end on Dongling’s heights. Their passions burned like wildfire, their coldness froze like ice, and so their hearts were shattered, reckless, and uncontrollable.

Yet the Sage does not pursue profit, does not shun harm, does not rejoice in longevity, nor lament early death. He does not prize advancement nor despise obscurity. Then what is there to desire? When desires do not arise, my heart is serene. When stirred, it responds; when still, it is unobstructed. In motion, it does not chase; at rest, it does not resist. What can disturb it?

Confucius was forty and free from doubt; Mencius, forty and no longer troubled in heart—both had attained this.

Thus, the Sage’s governance aims to keep the people in a state of *wu zhi* (無知) and *wu yu* (無欲). The valley is empty and thus responsive; the mirror is empty and thus reflective. The gourd is empty and thus can receive; the ear is empty and thus can hear; the eye is empty and thus can see; the nose is empty and thus can smell. If filled, they become obstructed.

The Sage, when compelled to govern the world, treats all with equal benevolence, strengthens the near while uplifting the distant, follows what is natural, and lets things unfold of their own accord—what need for scheming? Yao’s elevation of Shun and execution of Gun nearly achieved this.

When the heart is empty, it listens impartially and observes without bias, free from likes and dislikes. When the belly is full, the mind is content and at ease, free from greed. Why exalt the worthy or blame the unworthy?

The Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes. The belly, unselective, can contain all. The will is the mind’s knowledge; the bones are the body’s foundation. A strong will may lead one to relentlessly pursue fame or wealth, to boast of one’s abilities or flaunt one’s achievements—ever farther from the Mysterious Dao. Weak bones cause erratic movement, clashing with others until one is exhausted and cannot return.

The Sage’s will is ever humble, yet others exalt him. Ever yielding, yet others honor him first. Knowing strength, he embraces weakness; knowing glory, he embraces disgrace. This is called weakening the will to still it—nothing can then displace it. Firmly grasping it, nothing can overturn it. The unbroken essence, like that of Guangchengzi, lived twelve hundred years without decay—this is called strengthening the bones.

Zhuangzi said: *"In harmony with the unknowing, virtue does not depart. In harmony with desirelessness, this is called pristine simplicity. Pristine simplicity, and the people’s nature is preserved."*

The Sage’s governance seeks only to let the people preserve their nature. Excessive knowledge disrupts the appointed nature and fate; excessive desire drowns their natural inclinations. This is called governance, yet what chaos is greater?

Thus it is said: *"Keep the people in a state of wu zhi and wu yu, so that the learned dare not act, the eloquent dare not speak, the brave dare not display their strength, the capable dare not boast of their talents, the clever dare not scheme, and those who pride themselves on cleverness and cunning dare not multiply laws to exploit the people."* The Sage prohibits and stops all this—this is called *"the learned dare not act."*

When the Nine Virtues are fully cultivated and the talented are in their proper offices, is this not because knowledge is not prized? Simply executing the ruler’s commands and delivering them to the people—then there is nothing that cannot be governed.

The Sage’s governance is not about abandoning people and things, suddenly standing alone in a realm of non-action. It is about acting from non-action.

The transformations of all things occur in the realm of the manifest. The Sage embodies the Dao, standing above all things, unifying their completion, and ordering them. Things arise; follow them to observe their return. Things are born; guide them to their fulfillment. How could there be anything ungoverned?

When governance is supreme, the sun, moon, and stars follow their courses. When governance is supreme below, birds, beasts, grasses, and trees each fulfill their nature.

Wang Anshi said: *"Not exalting the worthy prevents contention among the people."* Discussing what is meant by *"not exalting the worthy"*:

The Sage’s heart has never sought to subdue the world through the worthy, yet the world submits to him—never without the worthy. If the people of the world are made to serve the world’s affairs, and the worthy are not exalted, then what reliance is there for governance?

The people, even in infancy, possess a natural inclination toward goodness. If they are not taught by the worthy, they cannot fully illuminate the world’s goodness. Once goodness is clear within oneself, how could the worthy not be revered? Thus, even if the laws and institutions remain, they are sufficient to restrain later chaos. If the worthy are exalted throughout the world, how could the people contend?

His intent is to make all under heaven clearly understand goodness, yet he does not advocate exalting the worthy. Still, the world is not so uniformly equal, and if the laws of exalting the worthy are abandoned, people may not necessarily understand goodness. Alas, the worthy cannot alone remedy the flaws of the unworthy—who knows the worthy who can make all under heaven sincerely and willingly submit?

Qi Huan Gong asked Guan Zhong: *"If I, alas, reach a point of no return, to whom should I entrust the state?"* Qi Huan Gong favored Yi Ya, but Guan Zhong said that Yi Ya, whom he did not often consult, was not as loyal as Xi Peng. If one elevates those who forget their superiors and rebel below, what greater harm from exalting the worthy could there be?

Some may say: *"Is this not what he means? He merely argues against its drawbacks."*

The Sage above does not prize rare and hard-to-obtain goods to the point of disturbing the heart. To exalt the worthy sparks contention; rare goods provoke theft. Both arise from what the heart desires. Thus, the Sage in governance does not command people to exalt the worthy or prize rare goods. If these two things are unseen, then the heart alone may remain undisturbed.

To exalt the worthy is good, but to prize rare goods invites theft—evil. Why reject both? For good and evil are opposites. Where there is good, there is also its opposite; both must be made to vanish.

There are two kinds of desire in the world: the desirable desire and the undesirable desire. As Mencius says, the desirable is called good—yet the eye’s delight in color, the ear’s in sound, the nose’s in scent—these are undesirable desires.

*The Explanation of Characters* states: *"谷 (gǔ) can receive; 欠 (qiàn) signifies lack."* That which can receive and endure, yet is not full—this is desire. Laozi says: *"Do not exalt the worthy, lest the people contend. Do not prize rare goods, lest the people steal. Do not display the desirable, lest the heart be disturbed."* These are Laozi’s one-sided, unbalanced words.

The ancient kings neither exalted the worthy nor despised it; neither prized rare goods nor rejected them; neither displayed the desirable nor concealed it. Yet Laozi’s words speak of the formless Dao: not exalting the worthy prevents burdening oneself with goodness; not prizing rare goods prevents burdening oneself with profit. Only thus can one remain undisturbed by the desirable.

Mencius said: *"The desirable is called good."* When goodness accumulates and fills to the divine, reaching this divine state, one no longer sees the desirable. Thus, the Sage’s governance strengthens the bones.

To empty the heart is to clarify that the worthy are not exalted; to fill the belly is to show that rare goods are not prized; to strengthen the bones is to demonstrate that the desirable is unseen.

The hearts of people differ in worthiness and unworthiness. If one exalts worthiness and unworthiness, contention arises. Thus, emptying the heart erases the distinction between worthy and unworthy, and so the worthy are not exalted. The belly, which can receive, if filled, makes rare goods mere trifles of food, sound, and color. All that is desirable becomes desire itself. Weakening the will prevents seeking; strengthening the bones ensures stability. Only by having no desires does one not see the desirable, yet remain steadfast. To have no desires yet stand firm—this is what the noble value.

If one constantly makes the people ignorant and desireless, empties their hearts, weakens their wills, and fills their bellies while strengthening their bones, the people will have no knowledge or desires. Even the wise will dare not act. If all the people are without knowledge or desire, even the wise among them will not dare to act. To act without action is to govern without fail. To act yet do nothing, to do nothing yet achieve all—this is the Sage’s way of *wuwei*, and thus nothing remains ungoverned.

Su Yingbin said: *"Not exalting the worthy prevents contention; strengthening the bones is the end."* If the worthy are exalted, the people will shame themselves for not measuring up and thus contend. If rare goods are prized, the people will suffer from lack and thus steal. If the desirable is displayed, the people will suffer from not obtaining it and thus rebel. Yet though the world knows these three as afflictions, if one seeks to abolish them outright, it is delusion.

The Sage does not act thus. Though the worthy are used, they are not exalted; though rare goods exist, they are not prized; though desirable things are present, they are not displayed. Thus, the worthy are employed yet the people do not contend; rare goods and desirable matters are before them, yet theft and chaos do not arise. Is this not the result of emptying the heart yet not filling the belly, weakening the will yet not harming the bones?

Now, if one were to exalt and display the worthy, treasure and prize goods, and flaunt the desirable, then both heart and belly would be filled. If one were to abolish them outright, then will and bones would weaken. When heart and belly are full, the people contend. When will and bones are weak, there is no foundation to stand upon.

If one constantly makes the people ignorant and desireless to the point where they dare not act, and does not flaunt these three things, then the people will know nothing to covet, their desires will be tranquil, and even the clever will have no schemes. To act without action is to govern without fail. This is to follow the natural course of these three things while neither exalting, prizing, nor displaying them—this is *wuwei*.

Lü Jifu said: *"Not exalting the worthy prevents contention."* The Sage knows that beauty is also ugliness, goodness also ungoodness, yet holds no private favor. Though he bestows all under heaven’s titles, he simply assigns duties, and the worthy are not exalted. The people’s contention always arises from comparing themselves to others in worthiness. Knowing the worthy are not exalted by the ruler, they do not contend.

*"Not prizing rare goods prevents theft."* Gathering all under heaven’s wealth is merely to nourish the people, yet rare goods are not prized. The people’s theft always arises from greed. Knowing goods are not prized by the ruler, they do not steal.

*"Not displaying the desirable prevents the heart from being disturbed."* Confucius said: *"If a man does not desire it, even if rewarded, he will not steal."* The desires of the noble are for the worthy alone.

The petty man’s desires are for wealth alone.
If I do not show what is desirable to him, then his heart will not be disturbed.

Yet this is not to abandon the worthy and leave them unused in the wilds,
Nor to discard rare goods and abandon them on the ground.
It is simply that within, they are not cherished in the heart,
And without, their traces are not left behind.

Thus, the Sage’s governance strengthens the bones.
The heart houses the spirit, and the abdomen is the heart’s dwelling.
To empty the heart is to preserve the spirit, and the abdomen becomes full.
The bones house the will, and the bones are the remnants of the kidneys.
To weaken the will is to steady the essence, and the bones grow strong.

If one always keeps the people without knowledge and without desire,
Then there will be nothing that is not governed.

The wise know that the worthy are not prized by the ruler,
And that wealth is not valued by him,
And that serving him brings no gain—
Thus, they dare not act.

Only thus can there be non-action and yet nothing remain ungoverned.

Master Lu the Farmer said:
*"Not prizing the worthy prevents contention among the people.
Abandon wisdom and discard knowledge, and the people’s profit increases a hundredfold.
Abandon benevolence and discard righteousness, and the people return to filial piety and kindness.
This is what is meant by not prizing the worthy, so the people do not contend;
Not valuing rare goods, so the people do not steal.
Abandon cleverness and discard profit, and thieves and robbers will cease.
This is what is meant by not valuing rare goods.
Not showing what is desirable prevents the heart from being disturbed.
If the people do not see goodness as desirable, then there will be no contention and disorder.
If they do not see profit as desirable, then there will be no theft and disorder.
Thus, when the Sage’s governance is complete, there will be nothing that is not governed.

The heart has knowledge and makes choices,
The abdomen has no knowledge but contains,
The will has desires and moves,
The bones have no desires but stand firm.
Therefore, the Sage’s governance empties the heart,
Fills the abdomen,
Weakens the will,
Strengthens the bones.
Empties what has knowledge,
Fills what has no knowledge—
Thus, the people can always be kept without knowledge.
Weakens what has desires,
Strengthens what has no desires—
Thus, the people can always be kept without desire."*

Master Wang Yuanze said:
*"Not prizing the worthy prevents contention among the people.
The worthy are those who excel among others—
If they are prized, the people will boast and emulate them from afar,
And contention will arise.
Not valuing rare goods prevents theft among the people.
When the people’s clothing and food are sufficient, their nature settles.
If rare goods are falsely prized, their pursuit will never cease,
And they will inevitably turn to theft.
Indeed, the people’s loss of their nature comes from false distinctions.
This chapter seeks to equalize all things,
So the people may return to their true nature.
Not showing what is desirable prevents the heart from being disturbed.
The ignorant falsely perceive what is desirable,
Which causes the heart’s dissolution and disorder.
Only the Sage knows that all things are not truly real,
Thus viewing all appearances with equal indifference and without preference.
Therefore, the heart’s mirror remains undisturbed,
And how can external things disorder it?
Thus, the Sage can neither prize the worthy nor value wealth.
Emptying the heart means no distinctions are made—
This further explains *not prizing the worthy*.
Filling the abdomen means nothing is sought or valued—
This further explains *not valuing rare goods*.
Strengthening the will leads to boasting and striving for victory,
Weakening the will means no scheming for external gain—
This again explains *not prizing the worthy*.
Strengthening the bones is for self-establishment,
And when one stands firm, external things cannot sway them—
This again explains *not valuing rare goods*.
Always keeping the people without knowledge and without desire:
Knowledge leads to false perceptions,
Desire leads to external seeking—
Once these are removed, nature and emotion settle.
If one does not prize the worthy and transforms them,
They can be made to reach a state of no desire.
Thus, the wise will not dare to act.
Those whose wisdom disrupts the masses should be restrained and stopped.
Non-action, yet nothing remains ungoverned—
Non-action is not true inaction; action lies in not acting,
With the aim of restoring their true nature.

Examining this closely, after the Three Dynasties,
There were no people who did not lose their true nature.
Thus, the noble strengthened their will and loved goodness,
Seeking the worthy without end;
The petty weakened their bones and craved profit,
Chasing wealth without satisfaction.
Strengthening the will leads to excessive knowledge,
Weakening the bones leads to excessive desire—
Whether one has knowledge or desire,
Though their pursuits differ, their harm to their true nature is the same.
The Sage is not thus.
Weakening the will means rejecting what is seen,
Lowering oneself to seek what is near,
And considering oneself as having no desires,
While the Dao suffices within.
Strengthening the bones is not for self-establishment as the worthy,
But to overcome desires for profit,
And to honor innate virtue.
Only then can fame not sway them,
Profit not drown them,
And their nature remain steadfast."*

Master Liu Zhongping said:
*"Not prizing the worthy reaches the point where the people do not steal.
Not prizing the worthy prevents contention among the people.
Not valuing rare goods prevents theft among the people.
This is the ancient Way.
Can the sages of later generations also restore it?
It is easy to not value rare goods,
But difficult to not prize those called ‘worthy.’
It is a matter of timing.
Yet there is a method to prizing the worthy.
Only when they are truly worthy should they be prized,
And yet none should be valued above others.
Thus, the world will trust this,
And contention will cease.
The *Book of Documents* says:
‘Not treasuring distant goods makes distant people respectful.’
This is not valuing wealth.
What is treasured is only the worthy,
Then near people are content—
This is prizing the worthy.
Distant people respectful means the people do not steal.
Near people content means the people do not contend.
Not showing what is desirable prevents the heart from being disturbed.
What is desirable is goodness,
What is not desired is not-goodness.
The Sage guides people with what is desirable,
And thus desire ceases.
What is desirable is understanding principle,
Without desire is fulfilling nature.
What is desirable can be spoken of to begin with people,
But cannot be demanded of them to the end.
To end with what is desirable is also to return to what is not-good.
Laozi said:
‘Not showing what is desirable prevents the heart from being disturbed.
What is desirable is goodness,
Thus it is said: *All under heaven know goodness as goodness,
And thus what is not-good already exists.*’"*

「To know the reason why goodness is goodness, one must deeply understand this truth.

Thus, when the Sage’s governance reaches its peak, there is nothing left ungoverned.
To empty one’s heart is to extinguish the love of evil,
And when the love of evil ceases, one’s resolve becomes tranquil and unified with the Dao.
Emptying the heart and weakening the resolve is how one nurtures the spirit.
Filling the belly and strengthening the bones is how one preserves one’s vital essence.

Yet the Sage always ensures the people have no knowledge and no desire.
The common people, once they know desire, cannot naturally rid themselves of it—
Only the Sage can make them so.
To empty the heart and weaken the resolve is to make them without knowledge;
To fill the belly and strengthen the bones is to make them without desire.

Moreover, the Sage ensures the people always abide by goodness.
For those who know, shame prevents wrongdoing—
When the Sage does not exalt virtue, yet the people contend, or when they covet wealth and steal,
It is because the Sage makes those who know dare not act.
If the people always abide by goodness, then even those who know dare not act—
And if they dare not act, this is truly the Dao.

The Sage does not speak of desire,
For desire arises from knowledge itself.
To act with *wu wei* (non-action) is to ensure nothing remains ungoverned.
To act with *wu wei* means to make those who dare act refrain from doing so.
When those who dare act refrain, the people without knowledge and desire find peace in their nature—
This is how the Sage governs.

The previous chapter spoke of the Sage using affairs and teaching as what should be done,
And exaltation of virtue and valuing wealth are merely remnants of such teaching—
Hence the next step: not to exalt virtue.
This chapter speaks of the Sage governing himself to transform the people,
Making them reach a state of no knowledge and no desire—
Then virtue and wealth are but external matters.

In later ages, when exaltation of virtue and valuing wealth cannot be abandoned,
Yet if the ruler can empty his heart and weaken his resolve,
Even if he complies with self-interest and merely exhausts the people to feed them,
Filling the belly and strengthening the bones will make valuing wealth difficult—
He must not enrich himself at the expense of others,
Nor hoard jade and pearls to bring ruin upon himself.
If this is so, then those who govern the people will feed them—
Who would make them contend?
If there is abundance yet no scarcity,
And boundaries are fixed, who would make them steal?

The *Chongning* commentary states:
*"When the Sage does not exalt virtue, the people do not contend, and thus all under heaven is governed without fail.*
Human beings are born in stillness—
This is the nature of Heaven.
When moved by external things, desire arises—
This is the nature of humanity.
The Sage in power does not exalt virtue nor value wealth,
So the people are not burdened by striving for goodness or profit.
If the heart is not emptied, it becomes disturbed;
If the belly is not filled, desire arises;
If the resolve is not weakened, rigidity remains;
If the bones are not strengthened, the body cannot stand.
To fill the belly is to have no craving for desire.
Mencius said:
*'If an action does not satisfy the heart, one must not do it.'*
And again:
*'When people have no hunger or thirst, the heart is still their greatest affliction.'*
Zhuangzi said:
*'The deeper one’s love of song, the shallower one’s connection to Heaven’s vital mechanism—
Shallowness brings constraint.'*
To weaken the resolve is to not exhaust one’s *qi*.
And again:
*'The scholar holds fast to his resolve.'*
But why does this text speak of weakening the resolve?
Mencius spoke of this in terms of the scholar’s conduct,
So I advance it.
Laozi spoke of this in terms of returning to the origin,
So I retreat it.

Liu Ji said:
*"When the Sage does not exalt virtue, the people do not contend, and thus all under heaven is governed without fail.*
Not to exalt virtue is to forget reputation,
And when reputation is forgotten, the people have nothing to boast or aspire to—
Thus they do not contend.
Not to value wealth is to forget profit,
And when profit is forgotten, the people have nothing to covet—
Thus they do not steal.
Not to show what is desirable is to make people rest their hearts from love and desire—
Thus they remain undisturbed.
When these three evils are removed, nature and emotion are settled.
Then one can empty the heart and fill the belly.
To empty the heart is to forget both self and external things;
To fill the belly is to preserve one’s spirit within.
To forget both self and external things is to have no desires or thoughts—
And thus the resolve naturally weakens.
To preserve one’s spirit within is to have a robust body—
And thus the bones naturally strengthen.
To weaken the resolve is to value the state of no knowledge;
To strengthen the bones is to value the state of no desire.
Hence, the Sage always ensures the people have no knowledge and no desire.
When the people have no knowledge and no desire,
They embrace simplicity and purity, and are thus born into the Dao."*

The Sage’s Dao is empty and natural, beyond contrivance.
To contrive is to ruin it; to grasp is to lose it—
Thus the wise dare not act at all.

To act without acting,
Then what is done arises from non-action,
And the marvelous workings of Nature
Leave nothing untended.

This is what Zhuangzi called:
*"Let the heart wander in simplicity,
Merge the qi with emptiness,
Follow things in their natural course,
And harbor no private schemes—
Then the world is governed,
For it has attained the Dao’s boundless, void-like power."*

Thus, the next step is to align with the Dao’s path.

Zhao Shiyuan remarked:
*"First, do not employ clever stratagems.
One: Eliminate rhetoric and sophistry.
Do not exalt the worthy, lest the people contend."*

The previous chapter spoke of the Sage’s non-action governing the world,
Yet when the work is done and not claimed,
It is the true, eternal function at play.
How could it rely on external force?

Thus, the Sage is not necessarily transcendent—
For there is no such thing as the Sage.
The wise are not discarded—
For there is no such thing as wisdom.
Only emptiness of mind remains.

Observe the Three Dynasties onward—
No one spoke of non-action.
Thus, they packed provisions for a thousand-li journey,
Sought worthy advisors to plan governance.

Laozi lamented their failure to grasp the root,
So he followed with *"Do not exalt the worthy."*

To entrust great matters does not mean entrusting small ones.
To be a Sage does not mean being merely worthy.
The great embodies the Dao’s non-action—
This is the Sage’s affair.
The small relies on cleverness and boasting—
This is the worthy’s affair.

Thus, the great Sage acts,
Governed by non-action’s root,
Letting the people each find their natural state,
And severing the hearts of ambition, rivalry, and contention.

As the *Yijing* says:
*"The Way of Heaven’s transformation—
Each returns to their true nature."*

When nature is rectified,
It remains pure and constant,
With no scheming mind—
Then who could distinguish the worthy from the unworthy?

If I wish for non-action,
I dull their ears and eyes;
If I wish for governance,
I unify their sincere hearts.

When cleverness arises, deceit follows;
When cunning intentions form, contention stirs.
When these shift,
How could they surpass governance?

The middle way of human nature can rise or fall—
Guided by the Dao, it returns to purity;
Lured by the worthy, it advances to contention.
Contention breeds contention—
The people’s nature shifts.

Though one might exalt the worthy,
Yet forbidding the people from knowing too much
Is not the same as nurturing true understanding,
Nor is it the same as teaching falsehood as virtue.

Thus, *"Do not exalt the worthy"*—
This is the operation of the most divine.

In the ancient times, rulers heard no mention of ministers.
Even the succession of Xīn and Nóng had none.
Yet when Huangdi fought at Yǒuqí,
Wind Master and Strength Master first appeared as ministers,
And when asked about governance,
He had More Area and Qi Bo as teachers.
Later, though the Sage’s Way still lingered,
The demand for assistance grew urgent.
The *Odes* say:
*"South has fine fish—
Then music and the worthy are cherished."*
*"South Mountain has a terrace—
Then music and the worthy are rejoiced in."*
Yet in *"The Simple One,"*
It criticizes the neglect of the worthy.
*"In the Hills There Is Hemp"*
Criticizes the exile of the worthy.
*"The Sly Boy"*
Criticizes not consulting the worthy in affairs.
Thus, when Great Simplicity had scattered,
The worthy could not be neglected.

Laozi, in the declining Zhou,
Wished to restore purity and return to simplicity,
So he spoke of *"not exalting the worthy."*
Not for any other reason—
Let the people be pure and simple, and they will not contend;
Let the people value things lightly, and they will not covet.

In all, it was to remedy the ills of his time.

Thus, exalting the worthy and employing the capable
Were the ancient kings’ establishment of proper rites, morality, laws, and institutions.
Not exalting the worthy, not employing the capable—
Laozi sought quietude and non-action.

Though their paths differed,
Their governance was one.

Thus, carrying a jar to water the garden,
Answering Zǐgōng’s inquiry;
Plowing fields without seeking office,
Fleeing Bóchéng’s pursuit.
And *"Horsehoof"* and *"The Thief"*—
All were scorned by the common people.

Two: Eliminate love of gain.
Do not prize hard-to-obtain goods,
Lest the people become thieves.
Do not exalt the worthy,
Lest the people contend.
Do not display desirable things,
Lest the heart be disordered.

This passage is called *"The Three Laws of Mysterious Unity."*
The first two sentences speak of governance;
The last speaks of self-cultivation.

First, master the way of self-cultivation,
Then one may govern the people.

To govern is to rectify—
Rectified, there is no deviation;
No deviation, there is no desire;
No desire, the heart is empty;
An empty heart does not stray;
When none stray, all things submit;
When all submit, clever schemes are unnecessary.

What need is there for the worthy?

Goods are exchanged for mutual benefit,
And sustenance for self and others is complete—
Though gold and jade may be prized,
They cannot fill hunger.
Guided by the Dao, each receives their due,
Without letting the low usurp the high,
Or the poor overpower the rich.
If there is competition,
Then nature’s true state is violated,
And they boast of strange, extravagant things.

This must lie in the ruler’s reverence for simplicity,
Not indulging in splendor.
When the people of the world transform without coercion,
Like Han Wen’s return of the thousand-li horse,
Or Jin Wu’s burning of the pheasant-feather robe,
Then the world’s love of goods is already stirred.

Thus, perfect governance does not rely on the three treasures.

Hanzi said:
*"The essential Way resides in the four cardinal virtues."*
Jia Yi’s extreme argument:
*"Cultivate the self with no desire,
Then the mind has no affairs—
No affairs, then tranquility arises."*

Thus, the clever dare not boast of their wisdom,
The capable dare not boast of their talents—
Who could then cater to their preferences?

Former rulers did not embody the ultimate Way,
But sought to outdo others with desires,
And deceitful ministers gained favor by indulging them—
None escaped ruin through this path.

Tai Jia said:
*"Desire destroys measures, enslaves the ears and eyes—
This is what desire does."*
Duke Zou also said:
*"Following desire is called the Way—
Exhausting it utterly."*

If one follows what others desire,
Without restraint or limit,
Then the world’s Way is exhausted by indulgence.

The Sage’s governance—
If one can eliminate desire and empty the heart,
Then the divine mind shines brightly,
Knowing the four directions is not far.

**III. Rectifying Nature and Emotions**

To see nothing desirable,
So that the heart remains undisturbed.
This means not letting any single thing weigh upon the heart—
Then the heart itself will be without attachment.

When one speaks of "seeing," it is not merely seeing with the eyes.
The six senses all perceive;
From perception arises desire,
And excessive desire disturbs the heart—
The heart is inherently impure.

Now, the eye is the foremost of the six senses.
Though called the "seeing root," the eye itself perceives,
And what it perceives—dust, objects—becomes its *jing* (境).
Though the ear is said to "listen," listening is truly a form of seeing,
And what it perceives—dust, objects—becomes its *jing*.
Though the nose is said to "smell," smelling is truly a form of seeing,
And what it perceives—dust, objects—becomes its *jing*.
Though the tongue is said to "taste," tasting is truly a form of seeing,
And what it perceives—dust, objects—becomes its *jing*.
Though the body is said to "touch," touching is truly a form of seeing,
And what it perceives—dust, objects—becomes its *jing*.
Though the mind is said to "discern," discernment is truly a form of seeing,
And what it perceives—dust, objects—becomes its *jing*.

This is called the six senses (*liùgēn* 六根).
The six senses generate six dusts (*liùchén* 六塵),
And the six dusts correspond to six *jing*s—
This is called the thirty-six *jie* (界) and eighty-one *lún* (輪) of rebirth,
The causal conditions of birth and death.

Though the objects of awareness differ,
They are all called *awareness*.
Though the objects of perception differ,
They are all called *perception*.

The six desires arise from the same mind,
And from the mind’s tendencies,
The three realms are but a single *shi* (識).

The six senses take in *jing*s,
Storing them in the mind—
The mind itself is the *zang* (藏) of *shi*.
The six senses are called the six *shi*,
With seven added above, totaling eight.

The seven *shi* are those that,
For the six *shi*, manage their functions and return to the eighth *shi*,
Also called *yi* (意).
The eighth *shi* holds the three *zang* (能藏, 所藏, 藏执),
And depends on all defiled and pure *dharma*s—
Thus it is called *zǐ* (種子).

The seven and eight *shi* are both called *yi* or *xin* (心).
Thus, the six desires defile and disturb one’s true nature—
Nature is the birth of the heart,
And the heart is the true nature itself.

From beginningless time,
You have prevented me from returning to the true Dao,
Because of your six *shi*’s insatiable grasping,
Causing this heart to ceaselessly labor,
Chasing the winds of love,
Never pausing in its frenzy.

Between looking up and down,
It flutters beyond the four seas,
Like a lamp flame in the wind, never still—
Thus, like disordered threads in the wind,
It cannot be tamed.

When the heart is not mastered,
It follows *jing*s endlessly,
Turning without rest,
Exhausting the spirit,
Daily drifting into delusion,
Transforming into strange forms,
With no way to return to its origin.

How grave is desire’s harm to nature—
Should one not be cautious?

For desire was not accumulated in a single day,
Nor was nature defiled in a single day—
Within lies *wúmíng* (無明), ruling as master.
From beginningless time until now,
Even from the moment of entering the womb,
Arising from impure *jing*s,
Karma and retribution are the cause,
And love gives birth.

From the moment of entering the womb,
Love is already present,
And within love lies desire,
Which gives rise to this heart.
By the time of infancy,
Though emotions are not yet fully awakened,
Joy and anger already stir within the heart.

Swiftly, one begins to distinguish affairs,
And the six desires arise,
Splitting into six *chù* (處),
Using one *jing* to receive,
Desire generating one mind—
Since the arising *jing*s are boundless,
The mind is also boundless.

Yet this single mind
Does not know where it dwells—
For desire prevails, and the heart is disordered.

Thus, the three realms’ first six heavens
Are called the *yùjiè* (欲界).
The first, the *Tàihuáng Yǔngzēng Tiān* (太皇黄曾天人),
Has all six sense-desires defiled.
The *Tàimíng Yùwán Tiān* (太明玉完天人),
Has one sense-desire coarse and pure,
And five coarse and defiled.
The *Qīngmíng Hétóng Tiān* (清明何童天人),
Has two sense-desires coarse and pure,
And four coarse and defiled.
The *Xuāntāi Píngyù Tiān* (玄胎平育天人),
Has three sense-desires coarse and pure,
And three coarse and defiled.
The *Míngwén Jǔ Tiān* (明文举天人),
Has four sense-desires coarse and pure,
And two coarse and defiled.
The *Shàngmíng Qīyào Tiān* (上明七曜天人),
Has five sense-desires coarse and pure,
And one coarse and defiled.

These six heavens are called the *yùjiè*.
The *Tàizhēn Kē* (太真科) says:
The first two heavens below are still coarse in retribution,
Where even bodily contact is desire.
The next two heavens take hand-holding as desire,
The fifth takes speech as desire,
And the sixth takes mere sight as desire.

Now, through these six desires,
One feels these six heavens.
For each sense-desire that is coarse and pure,
One ascends to a higher heaven.
When all six desires are transcended,
One enters the *sèjiè* (色界).

Only then does nature fully dissolve,
And one ascends to the *wúsèjiè* (無色界) heavens.
When called "without color," it means "without desire."

Indeed, at the start of cultivation,
Eliminating desire is difficult.
From the six realms to becoming human,
From the human path to sainthood,
The gate of transcendence is gradually consumed.

The *Sutra* says: *"Few desires, little selfishness,"*
The *Yì* (易) says: *"Restrain anger, suppress desire."*
The *Sutra* speaks of gradual refinement,
The *Yì* speaks of reduction.

Though scholars cultivate thus,
Those who harmonize with things like flowing water,
Without arising in thought to sever them—
Without roots, who has dust?
Without dust, who has *jing*s?
Understanding this,
One becomes a true person.

**Next, the Essentials of Governance**

**1. [Rectifying the foundation of governance]**
Thus, the Sage’s governance—
The first three sentences expound the three methods of profound meaning,
The last four sentences establish the four affairs of governance.

The character *shì* (是以) connects what follows,
Meaning the Sage understands these three principles,
And practices *xūxīn shífù* (虛心實腹),
*ruòzhì qiánggǔ* (弱志強骨)—
Thus, the Sage’s path is clearly articulated.

To not exalt the worthy is to eliminate cleverness and wisdom;
To not treasure wealth is to eliminate rare and strange things;

To see no desirable things, one’s heart finds peace.
These three principles form the foundation of governance.
Without this foundation, how can one seek stability?

The art of kingship has long been practiced.
These three principles, even the Sage has often heard them.
To hear them is to resolve to act upon them,
And their enactment lies in the four affairs.

Thus, Zengzi said:
To honor what one has heard brings clarity and brilliance,
To act upon what one knows brings radiance and grandeur.
What is meant by grandeur is to enact these four affairs:
The first is to empty the heart,
The second is to fill the belly,
The third is to weaken the will,
The fourth is to strengthen the bones.

**2. [The Depth of Emptiness]**
**Emptying the Heart**
Emptying the heart has four interpretations—three are false, one is true.
The first three are incorrect; the fourth alone is correct.

The first says: *"Like the emptiness of boundless space."*
The second says: *"Like the emptiness of a hollow valley."*
The third says: *"Like the emptiness of a tiger on a hill."*
The fourth says: *"To regard *One* as emptiness."*

The emptiness of boundless space, of hollow valleys, of a tiger on a hill—
These are all incorrect.
They cannot be likened to the void of *One*.
For if one’s heart is as empty as boundless space,
Even the solitary awakened may weary of vexation,
And though they bear no burden in their minds,
Sitting to observe the void—
The void stretches endlessly, yet nothing can be done.
How could the Sage of governance guard such emptiness as true emptiness?
This is the first error.

Again, if one takes the emptiness of a hollow valley as emptiness,
It is but a mountain’s hollowed-out cavern.
The valley’s resonance echoes with emptiness,
And when sound arises, it too is empty—
The two emptinesses merge, and only then do they respond.
Though this may seem a fine metaphor,
Scripture says: *"The spirit of the valley does not die."*
When we speak of the spirit of the valley,
We mean there is a spirit within the valley—
Not merely an empty hollow.
If the valley had no spirit,
What then would be this so-called divine essence?
When I call and it responds in harmony,
Could there be governance without a leader to initiate it?
If there is no leader yet harmony exists,
This is unnatural.
Thus, the emptiness of a valley cannot compare
To the Sage’s heart of governance.
This is the second error.

*The Book of Characters* says: *"Empty, and the hill becomes empty."*
Empty, and none dare approach.
The affairs of the king encompass the world as one family,
Not favoring only his kin,
Not cherishing only his children—
All are to be loved and benefited,
Until all under heaven turn toward him.
Could this be likened to a tiger’s isolation on a hill,
Severing all to create emptiness?
This is the third error.

Now, what is spoken of as *One* is indeed emptiness.
*One* is solid when in *Kàn* (坎), empty when in *Lì* (离).
Water and fire generate each other—
The movement of spirit and essence
Cannot for an instant be separated.
Thus, the Sage’s movement of spirit and the workings of the heart
Follow the unfathomable patterns of water and fire—
*One* is their origin.
The Dao produces *One*, and *One* is emptiness,
Not generating yet the source of all generation,
Without use yet the ancestor of all utility.
*One* is the sovereign—
In the *Xiàng* (象), three strokes form *Qián* (乾),
And three threes, two twos—
The three powers transform and adapt.
From *One* to three, to six,
Up to the three hundred eighty-four lines—
*One* encompasses all.

*One* is the divine.
To respond to emptiness with emptiness is useless—
Yet is it truly useless?
The Sage’s Way enslaves others without being enslaved,
Commands things without being commanded—
*One* without a second,
Mastering fate.
The *Han Stratagems* say: *"Fate"*—
Only the Sage can enact it.
*One* without disorder is the utmost stillness.
Stillness without change is the constant of the Way.
Change without change is the function of the Way.
When things change and I remain still, I guard *One*.
When I remain still and things move, I observe their return.
Thus, *One* is non-action,
Yet non-action is not non-doing.
The sovereign’s heart penetrates the Three Mysteries,
Enacting the four affairs—
Who would say emptiness and non-being are not governance?
This is the truth of *One* as emptiness.

**3. [The Dao is Fully *Qián*]**
**Filling the Belly**
The eight trigrams regard *Kùn* (坤) as the belly,
For it transforms into the five materials—
On earth, forming shape, *Kùn* is the storehouse,
Thus it is called the belly.
Again, the back is *yáng* (阳), the belly is *yīn* (阴),
And since it governs storage,
It holds what has passed—
Thus, it is the belly.

Earth governs intention, issuing forth as new,
Returning as what has passed—
All govern storage.
Because it holds much, it is called *filling the belly*.

Again, observing the two symbols *Kàn* (坎) and *Lì* (离),
*Kàn* is filled within—
It bears the symbol of a filled belly,
*Lì* is empty in heart—
It bears the symbol of an empty heart.
*Kàn* is firm, *Lì* is yielding—
Thus, the heart and belly are firm and yielding.

Scripture says: *"Man follows Earth,"*
And the *Yì* says: *"The way of standing on Earth is yielding and firm."*
Yet what is solid without emptiness to permeate it
Lacks divinity,
Thus it is said: *"Yellow Center, the harmony of principles."*
If emptiness does not tread upon solidity,
It cannot reach the pure, clear, awakened state.

The Commentary says:
An empty heart listens impartially and observes without bias,
Free of likes and dislikes—
This is the birth of clarity.
*Lì* is fire, the fire of enlightenment—
The Sage faces south to govern the world.
A filled belly is abundant and tranquil,
Without covetous desires,
Its capacity is public—
*Kùn* is the belly, and the belly governs receptivity—
The Sage’s central rectitude in observing the world is thus.

What was previously discussed—
Emptying the heart, filling the belly—
Reveals the Sage’s governance in action.

The functions of emptiness and fullness
In humans are affairs,
In the trigrams are *Kàn* and *Lì*,
In *qi* are *yīn* and *yáng*.
Their application in human affairs is as described,
Yet their application in *Kàn* and *Lì* differs in law.

Moreover, *yáng* is full, *yīn* is empty—
The alchemical method refines the two *bā* (八) of *yīn*,
Extending the nine *sān* (三) of *yáng*—
When *yáng* is pure, one becomes immortal;
When *yīn* is pure, one dies.
*Kàn*’s interior and exterior are *yīn*,
*Lì*’s interior and exterior are *yáng*—
Fire above, water below is *Unfinished* (未济),
Descending fire to meet water is *Completed* (既济).

From the Dao of Heaven and Earth,
From *Zǐ* to *Wǔ* it shifts to pure *yáng*,
From *Wǔ* to *Hài* it shifts to pure *yīn*—
This is the natural course of things.

Thus it is said:
Heaven and Earth move in accordance with the Way,
This is the constant method by which they transform.

Yet in the human body,
Does it not follow Heaven and Earth’s *yīn* and *yáng*?

To follow Heaven and Earth’s *yīn* and *yáng*
Is yet to have not attained the method of *zhì* (制).
One cannot but drift along with *zào huà* (造化),
Not knowing that the power to govern life lies within oneself.

The Dao of *yīn* and *yáng*:
To follow it leads to death,
To oppose it leads to life.

The Master of Taibai said:
*"Five Phases in Reverse—*
*The Dragon emerges from fire.*
*Five Phases not in order—*
*The Tiger is born in water.*
This is opposition—
Opposition brings life."

The *Tàishàng* (太上) speaks thus:
*"Water and fire align with the true substance of the Dao.*
*Their application is governed by technique,*
*So that the one *bǔ* (补) within *Kàn* fills *Lì*’s empty heart,*
*Transforming *Lì* into *Qián*—*
*Thus the Dao is complete.*
*If the heart remains empty,*
*Then *Lì* and *Kàn* are but lost in confusion.*
*The True Person says:*
*‘*Kàn*’s *yīn* is lost in confusion,*
*One *yáng* in *Lì* reveals its form.’*
*Píngshū (平叔) says:*
*‘*Point-transformation within *Lì*’s palace,*
*Deep in the *yīn* of the belly.’*
*Ultimately, it rests in attaining the One.*
*Once the One is attained,*
*It depends on the fire’s timing—*
*If the fire’s timing is insufficient,*
*How could it be supplemented?*

Some say:
*The Classics do not extend this far,*
*Only discussing the Sage’s governance.*
*How then does this relate?*
*They do not know that the Five Thousand Words*
*Are the essence of longevity.*
*Applied outwardly, they govern the world,*
*Applied inwardly, they lead to immortality.*
*Anqi Sheng was a strategist,*
*Zhang Zifang a kingmaker—*
*Anqi was not employed by Chu,*
*Zhang achieved great success in Han,*
*Yet both ascended to immortality—*
*This is the Dao of withdrawal and engagement.*
*How could the ignorant comprehend this?*

**Four: Gentle Submission and Self-Cultivation.**
*Weaken the will.*
Mencius said:
*"The will is the commander of *qi*.*
*The Commentary states:*
*The strong-willed may pursue fame without rest,*
*Or chase wealth without satisfaction.*
*Now, those who rush or retreat—*
*This is *qi* in motion.*
*If *qi* is made harmonious,*
*Internally it calms the spirit,*
*Externally it does not oppose things.*
*If not harmonious,*
*How could it avoid clenching fists and harming others,*
*Or raging and offending people?*
*It is not *qi* acting of itself—*
*The will commands it.*
*Thus it is said:*
*The will is the commander of *qi*.*

*Laozi* takes meekness and humility as the standard,
Saying the will must not be strong.
Yet in terms of governance,
If will and intent are not vast,
And understanding is not far-reaching,
How could one handle great matters?
One must be firm—
Firmness resolves softness.
Is it not that firmness alone is not enough?
Softness returns to firmness.
The Sage embodies Heaven’s alternating firmness and softness,
Each giving rise to the other.
If not decisive, it is not firm;
If firm, the Dao of *Qián* is complete.
Yet if firmness is excessive and unbalanced,
Excess brings regret.
*Qián*’s *yǔ* (用) of Nine
Reveals Heaven’s pattern—
Those who can employ Nine
Are said to have a weak will.
Yang Xiong said:
*"Seeing virtue and acting clearly—*
*The firm see virtue and clarify the Dao.*
*If the Dao is clear within me,*
*Then will and *qi* naturally grow vast.*
*In the gentleman, this is guarded with caution,*
*Hidden as if empty.*
*Thus it is guarded with weakness.*
*If one cannot guard it with weakness,*
*Then *qi* erupts and becomes impure.*

The Dao of nurturing *qi*
Finds its foundation in gentleness.
The Classic says:
*"Joyful as winter crossing a river,*
*As if fearing the neighbors."*
*So that the inner does not violate the outer,*
*Like a maiden in seclusion—*
*Otherwise, joy and anger attack each other,*
*And the harmony is injured.*
*The essence of longevity*
*Is most cautious here.*

Why not observe *Qián*’s Nine-Five—
*The Flying Dragon in Heaven,*
*Firmness in its proper place—*
*Advancing without excess,*
*For excess brings regret.*
*Dàyóu*’s Upper Nine
*Should be firm yet balanced.*
*Yet it follows sincerity and thinks of compliance,*
*Thus Heaven aids it—*
*Good fortune without hindrance.*

Still, this is timing,
Yet nature lies within it.
If one weakens the will to guard the One,
Unless one attends to it with *qi*,
It will surely reverse itself.

**Five: Establishing Virtue and Clarifying the Dao.**
*Strengthen the bones.*
What was previously called *"not valuing the worthy"*
And *"the able knowing"*—
*Peace of heart and below,*
*These four are the able in action.*
*But to strengthen the bones*
*Truly reveals the able.*

How so?
*Strong bones stand firm.*
*The Classic says:*
*"Sincerity issues from the will."*
*Mastering sincerity brings firmness.*
*Again it says:*
*"Heaven’s movement is vigorous,*
*The gentleman strengthens himself without rest."*
*Embodying *Qián*’s Dao,*
*He moves without obstruction,*
*Acts without haste—*
*Sincerity governs it.*
*Without sincerity, one does not stand.*
*This is what the supremely firm and great can practice.*

*From peace of heart and filling the belly,*
*To weakening the will in cultivation,*
*Until here—*
*This is nurturing the vast *hàorán* (浩然) *qi*,*
*Filling Heaven and Earth,*
*So mighty it cannot be uprooted.*
*Who could resist it?*
*The Classic says:*
*"The resolute have will."*
*This is first cultivating with softness,*
*Then attaining supreme firmness.*
*The Classic employs firmness before softness,*
*Laozi employs softness before firmness—*
*Each has its proper application.*

*The kidneys are one water, one stone—*
*Water is soft, symbolizing the will,*
*Stone is firm, symbolizing the bones.*
*From softness to firmness,*
*The transition is clearly seen:*
*One *yáng* arises in the depths of extreme *yīn*—*
*Softness at its extreme becomes firm.*
*One *yīn* arises in the depths of extreme *yáng*—*
*Firmness at its extreme becomes soft.*
*Thus one knows the alternating use of firmness and softness.*

*If one holds to this without acting,*
*It is called self-obscuring.*
*Self-obscuring—*
*How could it benefit the world and future generations?*

*The Sage observes Heaven’s Dao,*
*Prepares with compliance,*
*Wind, thunder, clouds, and rain applied in Heaven,*
*Rites, music, punishments, and governance applied in humanity—*
*Yet internally, one must not be firm to stand alone.*

The bones grow strong to stand firm,
Yet weakness guards them,
And uprightness guides their movement.

If one stands outstandingly erect,
Then it differs from the roots of desire.

Observe how many scholars of the Dao there are in the world—
Some know it, yet cannot guard it;
Guard it, yet cannot act upon it.
There is no other reason—
For the heart’s desire for gain overpowers,
And the Way of clarity and emptiness becomes difficult to return to.

Strengthen the will yet weaken the bones—
Like hoarding wealth without trade,
Shutting doors to guard it,
Yet unable to exchange it—
How then could one grow rich?

**Commentary:** *"The bones grow strong, yet their movement scatters and shifts—*
*This is to say there is no steadiness below."*

Only those who persist in self-strengthening
Can truly embody this.

The Three Governments’ teachings reach far—
Ever making the people without knowledge, without desire.
This sentence summarizes the preceding meaning,
While the next demonstrates the method.

Ever make the people without knowledge, without desire—
This is to emphasize:
*"Do not value the worthy,
Do not prize wealth,
Do not show what is desirable,"*
Thus achieving a hollow heart and full belly,
A weak will and strong bones.
The Sage, governing the world, relies on these seven principles—
Nothing else is needed—
Making the people without knowledge, without desire.

To value the worthy brings excessive knowledge,
Until the world is in uproar—
Confucians and Mohists arise in chaos.
To prize wealth brings excessive desire,
Until one risks life and nature for gain,
Seizing and deceiving without restraint.
To see names and profits as desirable—
All are deviations from the Dao.

Only the Sage can abandon these three,
And thus the people naturally have no knowledge,
Nor any desire.

Yet human nature is thick,
And circumstances shift with things.
For those above, cleverness and artifice
Are taught and refined—
But when carried to excess,
Laws and punishments cannot correct them.

**Master Dong said:**
*"When laws are issued, deceit arises;
When orders are given, fraud follows."*
This stems from past rulers’ poor instruction,
And the deep corruption of customs—
Not something that can be changed in a day.

Now, even if one tries to suppress it with laws,
Or reinforces it with decrees,
Their deceitful hearts remain—
Only the Dao can transform them.

Laws began with Fu Xi and were perfected by Yao,
Fully developed in the Zhou—
Yet cleverness reached its peak.
Thus it is known that when the Zhou declined,
The Dao faded.

Laozi composed the *Classic*,
Its intent here.
Yet it was not merely for his time—
It was meant as an oracle for all ages.

When chaos arose, it was no different from the Warring States—
The excess of valuing the worthy, prizing wealth, and excessive desire.

**Confucius said:**
*"The people can be made to follow, but not to understand."*

**Emperor Yao heard a child’s song:**
*"Unknowing, unknowing,
Following Heaven’s patterns."*

If those above are knowledgeable and desiring,
Yet wish the people to be without knowledge or desire—
This is impossible.
It is like hating drunkenness yet forcing wine—
Truly, nothing is better than
Using utmost sincerity to transform them,
Purity and simplicity to guard them.
If those above act as if foolish,
The people below remain unknowing—
As Zhuangzi said:
*"The ruler like a tree branch,
The people like wild deer—
What use is there for rewards and punishments?"*

Forced effort and rigid conduct,
Separating from the world and customs—
The people begin to doubt.

**Second Point: Restraining cleverness and artifice.**
Make the knowledgeable dare not act.

The *Classic* says:
*"I will deceive them with simplicity—*
*The people are hard to govern because their cleverness is excessive."*

**Zhuangzi said:**
*"When the Dao prevails in the world, the Sage completes it;
When the Dao does not prevail, the Sage arises."*

Excessive knowledge and desire
Throw the world into chaos—
Until the people lose their natural nature,
And punishment is used to suppress them—
This is the root of greater disorder.

The Qin poisoned the world—
Their cleverness was supreme,
Yet they could not use benevolence and righteousness,
Only punishment and coercion,
To govern the world—
Their kindness did not reach the people,
So their downfall came swiftly.

Yet the people were not without knowledge—
It could be hidden and unused.
Only if those above do not provoke it,
Then those below, though knowing, dare not act.

*The Yinxu Classic* says:
*"Cut off the root of gain,
And ten armies will be useless."*
This is what is meant.

If those who know dare to act,
Then even strict prohibitions are insufficient.
To this point, even if one wishes to punish them,
There are those punishment cannot reach.

Thus it is said:
*"I take no action, yet the people transform themselves."*

**Fourth: Displaying the function of *wuwei*.**

1. *Transformation proceeds without display.*

*Wuwei* yet action—
This sentence summarizes the entire meaning,
To show that the Sage, though governing through *wuwei*,
Is never without action.

*Wuwei* cuts off external interference,
Action aligns with affairs—
What is not the Dao becomes the Dao in practice.

To act without showing traces of action,
To govern without displaying governance—
This is the pinnacle.

How then does one act without showing traces,
Or govern without displaying function?

*The Book of Changes* says:
*"Motionless yet responsive,
Stirred and thus in harmony."*

The unmoving is nature,
The responsive is emotion.
Nature is originally *wuwei*—
The essence of the Dao.

The Dao as nature
Is formless in reality,
Yet at its extreme, it manifests—
From Heaven and Earth to all things,
None arise without this.

*The Commentary* says:
*"All things flourish,
Yet they all stem from *wuwei*—this is the Dao."*

Emerging from the Sage’s heart,
Responding to the divine in sequence—
Penetrating Heaven, Heaven responds;
Penetrating Earth, Earth responds—
Nothing but the movement of spirit.

What is seen in the movement of spirit—
This is action.
What moves yet shows no progress—
This is originally *wuwei*.

Moreover, if one does not act,
Could the world’s affairs be neglected for a day or two?
Neglect leads to disorder.
If one governs each matter,
Inspects each thing—
Then labor is endless.

Exhaustion leads to decline,
Decline leads to disorder.

Now, the Way of action—
How could it avoid
Ren with its benevolence,
Righteousness with its fittingness,
Ritual with its form,
Trust with its sincerity,
Grace with its love,
Law with its authority?

If one governs without these,
Yet still seeks order—
It cannot be attained.

In the Age of the Yellow Emperor,
Gifts were exchanged without written laws,
But by the time of the Three Sovereigns,
Knots on cords were already used.
Generally, in ancient times,
The people were pure and simple,
And the efficacy of *wuwei* was easily seen.

If one claims that later ages
Must only act and cannot practice *wuwei*,
Then the Dao cannot be followed.

Only the Sage who embodies the Dao
Can harmonize these truths.

The *Yijing* says:
*"Its Way is vast—
No thing is neglected."*

To neglect nothing is truly *wuwei*.
Yet when seeking the Dao,
The Dao itself is *wuwei*.

This is what is meant by
*"Doing without doing."*

Consider this:
*Wuwei* is the Sage within,
Action is the Sovereign without.
The Sage within is profound in emptiness,
The Sovereign without creates deeds and enterprises.

With a heart of profound emptiness
To undertake affairs,
Then actions arise from the Dao,
The Dao roots in emptiness—
*Wuwei* and action blend without trace.
What more is there to seek?

This treatise concludes
By not valuing the worthy,
Desiring the Sage’s solitary transformation.

Solitary transformation is divine.
If one does not personally embody the Dao,
Yet achieves *wuwei* naturally—
This is the governance of the Great Sage.

If one relies on worthy ministers,
That is retreat.
Now, let us observe the Sage’s divine teaching:

Shaking the hearts of people,
Guiding them toward virtue and custom—
Their simplicity grows gradually,
Their awakening comes softly.
Without action, all things transform;
Without *wuwei*, the people are settled—
This is divine.

Now, observe the succession of Yao to Shun:
Shun appointed the Nine Ministers,
And Gao Yao said:
*"Knowledge lies in knowing people,
Knowing people makes one wise,
Able to govern officials and settle the people—this is benevolence."*

Again he said:
*"All craftsmen follow their seasons,
The common people continue their labors."*

Thus, when the court was orderly,
It could lead all under Heaven.

As for *Zhonghu*’s praise of Tang,
*"He used people only as he himself would,"*
Yet he still required worthy ministers as assistants.

Again it says:
*"Seek the talented and capable
To jointly achieve the governance of all under Heaven—
The wise plan for it,
The capable execute it,
The ruler rests while ministers labor."*

This, seen in practice,
Shows the ruler’s ability to entrust others,
Thus achieving *wuwei* governance.

The one who depends on nothing
Is the Sage’s *wuwei*.
The one who depends on the worthy
Achieves *wuwei* through them.

Generally, having worthy ministers brings order,
Losing them brings ruin.
Not valuing them is the way of the Great Sage.

The world often says
That Laozi’s teachings
Resemble the chaos of the primordial age,
Not the Way of governance—
How then can it be called *wuwei*?

*Wuwei* is not neglecting the Middle Way.
The Dao aligns with nature—
Then nothing remains untended.

Thus, *wuwei* is seen in its efficacy.
When it comes to *wuwei*,
It merges with the Dao.

**The Moral and Virtue Classic: Collected Meanings**

**On the Chapter "Not Valuing the Worthy"**

Sūshì Liú Wéiyǒng compiled, with annotations by the former Court Attendant and Treasury Bureau Clerk, former *Jùnmì Yuàn* Editor Dīng Yìdōng.

**Shào Ruòyú** said:
*"Not valuing the worthy"* makes the people not contend—thus achieving *wuwei*, and nothing remains untended.

He who does not value the worthy and able fears that men will boast of their wisdom.
What the king favors becomes the *wind*; what the people delight in becomes the *custom*.
When the ruler prizes the wise and clever, the common folk’s hearts turn to rivalry and striving.

*"Not valuing the worthy"* prevents the people from contending over reputation—that is all.

Food is but a commodity; its purpose is to sustain life—why then prize what is rare?
If rarity is prized, the people will surely hoard it.
By human nature, if given, they will not accept it; if hoarded, they will steal and plunder.

In governing, one does not refrain from using wealth—yet one does not prize rare and difficult-to-obtain goods, lest the people become thieves.

When the common folk see no allure in fame or gain, their desires grow orderly, and the people govern themselves.

Thus, the Sage’s governance:
*"Not valuing the worthy"* makes the people ignorant—ignorance empties the mind, and an empty mind can embrace all things.
Hence, *"fill their bellies."*
*"Not prizing wealth"* makes the people desireless—desirelessness weakens the will, and a weak will does not bend to circumstance.
Hence, *"strengthen their bones."*

Ever keep the people ignorant, so their minds remain empty;
Ever keep them desireless, so they forget the world.
When mind and world are both forgotten, no attachments remain—all affairs cease.
Thus, even the wise dare not act.
The Sage acts with no intention—then nothing in the world remains untended.

**Wáng Zhìrán** said:
*"Not valuing the worthy"* makes the people not contend—thus nothing remains untended.

To speak of the Dao yet disregard its order is not the Dao.
To speak of the Dao yet misunderstand it—how can one claim to have found it?

Zhuangzi’s *"Nine Transformations"* and *"Five Changes"*—discarding or upholding *xíngmíng* (names and forms)—is like walking the Dao backward.
Those who encounter the Dao and praise it—how can they govern others?
Those who suddenly speak of *xíngmíng*—have they not yet grasped the fundamental intent of learning and governance?

Names are the guests of reality.
Once names and reality are fixed in their internal and external distinctions, all under Heaven’s ranks follow their duties—why would the worthy be abandoned in the wild, unused?

Yet Laozi’s intent in saying *"do not value them"* holds profound meaning.
Thus Zhuangzi says: *"To promote the worthy is to invite contention over titles."*

Valuing the worthy sparks contention—leading to chaos under Heaven, where cunning deceit, disputes over right and wrong, and the dissolution of morals arise.
Confucians and Mohists all emerge—such is the danger of valuing the worthy.

Gathering all under Heaven’s wealth to nourish its people, yet the people are content, striking the earth and singing, drumming their bellies and wandering—each thing serves its purpose without being enslaved by things.
How could one secretly prize such a state?

Laozi’s intent in saying *"do not prize them"* is also profound.

All things under Heaven flourish in their appointed roles—each has its place.
When their time to flourish comes, so too comes their time to decay.
When their time to be prized comes, so too comes their time to be despised.
This is their natural course—how can one’s heart interfere?

Those who seek to prize them must obtain them at all costs.
If they cannot, they will risk life and limb to seize them—
leading to robbery, covetousness, and every vice.
Is theft the only sin?

This stems from the ruler’s preferences—when the ruler favors something, the people will pursue it excessively.

The *Classic* says: *"Do not let the desirable be seen, lest the heart be disturbed."*
Confucius said: *"Wealth and honor are what people desire."*
Even what is seen and heard—scented, tasted, or felt—stirs the emotions and disturbs the mind, all called *"desirable."*

If desire is insatiable, even Heaven and Earth’s vastness and all things’ abundance cannot satisfy it.

The gentleman desires *name*; the commoner desires *gain*.
If all under Heaven—worthy or unworthy—see no desirable desires, their hearts remain still—what disturbance could there be?

Thus the Sage ever empties the mind, unfettered by any thing;
Ever fills the belly, unobstructed by any thing.
Within, observing the mind—vast and empty;
Without, observing the form—yielding with things like flowing water.
From afar, observing things—things have no hold on him.

Thus, a weak will is useful; strong bones stand firm.
Where the will directs, there it guards.
The kidneys store the will, and bones are the kidneys’ remnant—
Weakening the will steadies the essence, and the bones grow strong.
The heart stores the spirit, and the belly is the heart’s dwelling—
Emptying the mind preserves the spirit, and the belly is filled.

From this, all transformations arise in the body;
Spirit and essence arise from the Dao—
With this, one governs humanity and harmonizes with Heaven.

Ever keep the people ignorant and desireless,
So even the wise dare not act.
Only thus does nothing remain untended.

Zhuangzi said:
*"In harmony with ignorance, virtue does not depart;
In harmony with desirelessness, this is called *sūpǔ* (primordial simplicity)."*
Primordial simplicity restores human nature.

If so, how could the world know whether the worthy should be valued or not,
Whether wealth should be prized or not?

**Huáng Màocái** said:
*"Not valuing the worthy"* reaches the point where the heart is undisturbed.
Just as one harmonizes one’s radiance, fearing others’ knowledge—
Why value the worthy? Thus, the people do not contend.
The non-contending each find contentment in their nature’s spontaneity.

Just as one restrains desire, fearing things’ disturbances—
Why prize wealth? Thus, the people do not steal.
The non-stealing take sufficiency in themselves and have abundance.

*"Not seeing the desirable"* is not closing one’s eyes to it.
Many things pass before us, stirring the heart—
One may not know what can be obtained,
But if one sees only that nothing is truly desirable,
Then nothing can disturb the heart.

「What then? The beauty of Máoqiáng and Lìjì is renowned throughout the land—
no one fails to covet it.
Yet fish seeing them dive deep, birds seeing them soar high,
and deer seeing them flee swiftly—
by this reasoning, indeed, if one truly sees nothing as desirable,
then the heart remains undisturbed.

Thus, the Sage’s governance reaches the point of filling one’s belly.
Nánguō Zǐtài reclined behind his screen, gazing heavenward and sighing,
lost in his own emptiness—
to cultivate the heart to this extent is what may be called *emptiness* (虚).

Beyond mere satiation, though rare delicacies and sumptuous flavors
be displayed before him,
he fears only that they may not be swiftly cleared away—
this is why his belly craves only the real.

The *Classic* states: *"The Sage governs for the belly, not for the eyes."*

Weaken one’s resolve.
Those who strengthen themselves have resolve.
Now, why weaken it?
Strengthening oneself may advance one toward the Dao,
but weakening it may lead one to the state of daily diminishment.

Strengthen one’s bones.
The Dao of Lǎozǐ runs deep in the principle of *strong strength* (强强).
Thus it is said: *"The overbearing shall not meet their natural end."*
Now, why strengthen one’s bones?
It is a warning against the strong—
lest they contend with things.
Strengthening one’s bones is self-strengthening.
The Dao stands firm and unchanging—
how could the weak govern it?
Always keep the people without knowledge and without desire.

Lǎozǐ likened governing the state and the people
to cultivating oneself,
saying *"to make the people"* is to make oneself—
without knowledge and without desire,
not like the dullness of wood or stone that lacks all desire.
At first, one cannot lack knowledge entirely—
to remove knowledge until it is utterly gone;
at first, one cannot lack desire entirely—
to remove desire until it is utterly gone.
Then, who but a Daoist gentleman,
with his accumulated virtue,
could achieve this?

If the wise are allowed to appear,
then nothing shall remain ungoverned.
The Dao is natural—
how could it be shaped by intelligence?
Only by acting without action in non-action
may it be attained.

Chéng Tài’s words on governance say:
*"Not valuing the worthy brings the people to non-contention,
until the heart is undisturbed."*
If such a person is worthy,
yet he hides his excellence and does not display it,
flashing his brilliance before the world,
then surely there will be those who shame themselves
for not being equal to him
and who strive to contend with him.
Thus Zhuāngzǐ said: *"To elevate the worthy is to invite the people to jostle."*

To prize hard-to-obtain wealth
is to invite those who abandon their livelihoods
to chase profit,
and who do not hesitate to become thieves.
Thus it is said: *"Wealth accumulates, then contention arises."*
Contention and theft all stem from seeing what is desirable
and thus stirring the heart.
If the ruler conceals his likes and dislikes,
and does not reveal them,
then the people below have no direction for profit,
and all that is desirable no longer appears before them.
The heart remains undisturbed,
and contention and theft naturally cease.
This is the Dao of Lǎozǐ—
rectifying the root and clarifying the source.

Jiāng Yǔ’s exhortation on governance says:
*"Necessarily elevate those of public loyalty,
and let there be nothing private,
then who among the people would dare not to be orderly?"*
Jiāng Yǔ’s words,
though common among those who seek governance since Yáo and Shùn,
were criticized by Jìzhé, who said:
*"If you speak thus, it is only your own way of acting."*
The dangers of the high platform are many,
and those who would cast their lot there are numerous—
a criticism of displaying excellence openly,
as clear as the platform’s invitation to all,
so that they see what is desirable and flock to it,
and contention grows.

Yet, if the worthy are seen but not valued,
is this not a distinction?
It is only to obliterate traces
and thus extinguish contention.
All that Lǎozǐ’s teaching seeks to conceal and use subtly
holds this same intent.
*See* (见) is read as *manifest* (现)—
when the ruler steps forth and reveals himself.

Thus, the Sage’s governance reaches the point of strengthening one’s bones.
The mind is always present in thought,
and resolve is present when action is desired.
The belly is for nourishment,
and the bones are for bearing burdens.
Lǎozǐ’s text contains metaphor and direct speech—
here, the belly and bones
are indeed their true names.

In a later passage, it is said:
*"The people’s hunger comes from their rulers’ excessive taxation."*
This is the case where one should fill what is real
and dispel what is false.

Again it is said:
*"The people are difficult to govern because their cleverness is excessive."*
This is the warning against the strong
and the search for means to weaken them.

Gēngsāng’s dwelling feared collapse—
his clever ministers left him,
his compassionate concubines withdrew—
not allowing his heart to harbor cleverness or compassion,
this is the pursuit of emptiness.

To dwell with those who are bloated
and to appoint those who are clumsy—
bloated and clumsy are not those whose bones are strong
and can endure burdens,
yet they are not counted among the few.
This is why he established Gēngsāng’s principles,
mocking Yáo and Shùn’s elevation of the worthy
and appointment of the clever.

Always keep the people without knowledge and without desire.
If the people have knowledge, then their cleverness is excessive,
and this is why they are difficult to govern.
If they have desire, then they see what is desirable,
and this is why contention and theft arise.
Lǎozǐ values *non-action* (无为),
wishing to place the world in a state of *non-affairs* (无事),
and to make the world also content with *non-affairs*.
Zhuāngzǐ’s words on governance effects say:
*"To align with the lack of knowledge—
its virtue does not depart.
To align with the lack of desire—
this is called *primordial simplicity* (素朴)."*
In primordial simplicity, the nature of the world is attained.

If the wise are not allowed to act,
then they do not dare to act.
To make the people without knowledge and without desire
is to make them dull.
Yet among them are those who are obstinate and clever,
unreceptive to dullness—
these are the ones called *clever*.
The clever cannot be made dull again.

Thus, if all under heaven follow my teaching,
then they shall all be without knowledge and without desire.
Without knowledge and without desire,
they shall love their native soil and find joy in their work,
and cannot be lured into chaos.
Even if there are the clever,
knowing they have no one to join them,
they shall lose resolve and no longer dare to act.
Hence it is said:
*"Make the people value death over migration,
then even with armies and weapons,
there shall be no place to deploy them."*
The Sage who claims he can again bind the people with knots
achieves this through these very means.

Zhuāngzǐ took this language and entrusted it to antiquity,
saying:
*"The ancient people dwelled in the *chaotic undifferentiation* (混茫),
and with the world attained *tranquility* (澹漠)."*»

At this very time, all things remain unharmed, all living beings do not perish young, and though people may have wisdom, they have no use for it—this is the very proof of it. To act through *non-action* (*wuwei*) is to ensure nothing remains untended.

Though it is said to act through *non-action*, this does not mean abandoning deeds entirely. Rather, to dwell in *non-action* and govern through *non-interference*, this is what is meant by *wuwei*. I govern through *non-action*, and the people respond with their own *wuwei*—this is what is called *"govern through non-action, and the people transform themselves; govern through non-interference, and the people prosper on their own."* How then could there be any failure to achieve order?

Zhān Qiúbù said: *"If one does not exalt the virtuous, the people will not contend for them, and thus nothing remains ungoverned."* The chapter *"Nurturing the People"* speaks of not desiring to honor the virtuous, so that the people do not grow reckless and contend for fame. Not valuing rare treasures and strange jewels, so that the people do not turn to theft. Not displaying alluring luxuries and dazzling beauties, so that the heart does not generate chaotic desires. Thus, the Sage who governs the people, wishing to dwell in harmony with them for long, must first empty his own heart and abandon his cravings, always keeping the people in a state of *wu zhi wu yu* [without knowledge, without desire]. Even if they are wise, they dare not act. Thus, through *non-action*, governance becomes effortless and stable.

Zhang Chong replied: *"If one does not exalt the virtuous, the people will not contend for them, and thus nothing remains ungoverned."* Laozi emerged from the ancient past, when customs were pure and people were simple. They lived daily in *wuwei*, forgetting fame and gain, abstaining from music and color, their five spirits unperturbed. From the ancient times onward, the people changed from *Huang* [Yellow Emperor], to *Shi* [Emperor], to *Di* [Emperor], to *Wang* [King], with officials named after birds, then dragons, then kings, nobles, ministers, and great officers—all adorned with grand titles. Thus, empty names flourished, and the world came to revere those who wielded power through cleverness. Hence, Bi Gan contended and died, while Yi and Qi could not contend and so withdrew. The suffering of endless wars and strife arose, and yet they dug mountains and plundered the sea, mined gold and sifted sand, seeking fine jade and precious stones—never satisfied. Strange treasures and marvelous jewels only deepened their delusion. The world treasured rare and difficult-to-obtain goods, so Yu’s clan perished for hoarding jade, and Shi’s family was ruined for hiding treasure—thus bringing ruin to themselves and their virtue.

Again, the licentious sounds of pipes and bells assailed the ears, the wanton allure of women dazzled the eyes, strange flavors offended the palate, strange scents assailed the nose, and strange garments offended the body—clouding the mind and scattering the spirit—while alluring forms were laid bare. Thus, Shang fell to its debauchery of nightlong drinking, and Chen was destroyed by its decadence in the rear chambers, giving rise to regicide, rebellion, and chaos—all from these three evils.

Thus, the Sages of antiquity governed the people with no other means: they did not exalt those who wielded power through cleverness, did not treasure rare and difficult-to-obtain goods, nor indulged the allurements of desire. When the ruler acted thus, the people followed suit, and there was nothing to stir the hearts of contention, theft, or rebellion.

Thus, when the heart is emptied and no action is taken, the three evils [contention, theft, rebellion] are restrained. When the belly is filled and the Dao is cultivated without action, the three evils are exhausted. When the will is weakened—neither exalting, nor treasuring, nor desiring—while the bones are strengthened to remain ever healthy, strong, and at peace, if people observe my *non-action*, they will naturally be without knowledge and without desire.

Should any wise person wish to exalt the virtuous, to treasure rare goods, or to indulge the five senses—eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and body—even they dare not act. Thus, all people act as if in *non-action*, and there is none who remains ungoverned.

Zhang Lingying said: If the heart is not emptied and clarified, how can the *qi* be harmonized and the organs filled? If the will is not humble and weak, how can the essence be solidified to strengthen the sinews and bones? When the heart is always empty, the *qi* is not depleted; when the will is always weak, the essence is not wasted. Then the belly is full, the bones are strong—what more could ail one with fears of *trendency* (*quju*) or *nocturnal emissions* (*mengyi*)?

Generally, when a man suffers from *trendency*, it arises from *qi* that is not harmonized; when he loses semen in dreams, it comes from essence that is not solidified. Both stem from *qi* not harmonized—because the heart is not emptied—and essence not solidified—because the will is not weakened.

Bái Yùqiān said: *"Not exalting the virtuous"* means that as a son, one must be filial; as a subject, one must be loyal—thus the people do not contend, and when full, they do not crave more food. *"Not treasuring rare goods"* means gold is valued no more than soil—thus the people do not steal, for there is nothing to desire. *"Not displaying alluring luxuries"* means the heart remains steadfast between the ears—thus the heart does not stray; when it does, it is called back. Therefore, the Sage’s governance lies in emptying the heart, filling the belly, weakening the will, and strengthening the bones—always keeping the people without knowledge and without desire. Even the wise dare not act. Thus, through *non-action*, nothing remains ungoverned.

Lào Cùirán said: *"Not exalting the virtuous"* means the Daoist scholar does not seek honor and wealth.

*"Make the people not contend"* means they remain silent and simple like the foolish, attaining the *Three Mysteries of Non-Contention*.*

*"Not treasuring rare goods"* means viewing worldly riches as mere dust, neither greedy nor desiring—treasuring the *Inner Elixir* as the supreme treasure, cherishing oneself without arrogance—thus the people do not steal.

*"Knowing this, yet not desiring what is not desired"* means the external self does not cling to things, while the internal self remains unseen, keeping the heart unmoved, like the *Great Void*—as still as the immovable.

Therefore, the Sage’s governance: the ruler governs the land with the Dao, and I cultivate my body with this principle.

*Empty the heart*—let emptiness be the body, let non-action be the heart.

*Fill the belly*—let the divine *qi* surge vigorously, guarding purity within, refining the *Kàn* position at the center, and alchemizing the *Lí* Palace’s inner yin.

*Weaken the will*—concentrate the *qi* to its utmost softness, motionless and tranquil, yet fierce in battle, victorious—then suddenly strike like thunder, erupting as the earth’s lightning.

*Strengthen the bones*—hide the form within the body, conceal the spirit within the heart; draw water and fire to nourish the elixir daily, so that *golden sinews* and *jade bones* grow naturally firm.

Always let the people be without knowledge and without desire—then the land is secure, the people prosper, and there is no other way. My descendants will also face no troubles.

Even the wise, *when they understand this truth*, dare not act.

Thus, through *non-action*, all is governed.

How could *non-action* ever be mistaken for mere *inaction*? The Dao ever flows naturally—then nothing remains ungoverned.

If you grasp the One, all things are complete.
Then how could it not be joyous?

Chen Bi Xu said:
*"Do not exalt the worthy, and the people will not contend.*
For when the ruler is humble, yielding, and tranquil—
not boasting of his own virtue and ability—
the people follow his transformation like wind sweeping grass,
guarding with gentleness and submission—
what room is there for contention?

The Classic says:
*'I act with non-action, yet the people transform themselves;
I love tranquility, yet the people align themselves.'*

It is further explained:
*'When the ruler is tranquil, ministers are clear;
punishments do not spare the noble, blessings do not exclude the lowly;
the worthy and unworthy each fulfill their roles—
then the scholars will not contend.*

But if the ruler is indecisive, ministers flatter and deceive,
even if he exalts the worthy and seeks talent,
those with outward loyalty but inward deceit—
poisonous in intent yet harmonious in speech—
will arrive, and then deceit and strife will arise.

Yan Jun Ping said:
*'The virtuous rule as sovereigns, the lesser serve as ministers.
The worthy are not one in ten thousand, sages do not appear in every age.
The worthy are not produced by exaltation—
this is natural, not contrived.'*

He further said:
*'As if driving a poor horse and a fine steed together on a level road,
or letting a wild goose and a partridge fly side by side in the blue sky—
then the worthy and unworthy become apparent.*

This is natural, not the result of exaltation.
Thus it is said:
*"Do not exalt the worthy, and the people will not contend;
do not prize hard-to-obtain goods, and the people will not steal.*
Hard-to-obtain goods are gold, jade, pearls, and rhinoceros horn.
When the ruler’s transformation is pure and tranquil,
the people attend to farming and weaving,
burying gold in the mountains and casting pearls into the depths,
finding no profit in wealth or attraction in riches—
then the people’s hearts will harbor no greed or theft.

It is further explained:
*"The black dragon’s night-light pearl,
gold, jade, brocade, and embroidered adornments—
if the ruler does not prize them,
the subjects will not covet them,
then where would thieves and robbers arise?
The saying goes:
*'If a man does not desire it, even if rewarded, he will not steal.'*

*The Hong Lie Jie* cites the laws of Shennong:
*'If men of strength do not till the fields, there will be those who starve in the world;
if women of childbearing age do not weave, there will be those who freeze in the world.
Thus, let the ruler himself plow and his wife weave,
setting an example for the world.*

In guiding the people, he does not prize hard-to-obtain goods,
nor does he display desirable things to keep their hearts undisturbed.
Desirable things are those external objects or passions
that stir the heart to admiration or lust.
Yet *not seeing* does not mean banishing them from sight—
it means not letting them be seen as desirable,
but rather embracing *non-action* toward them.

If the ruler, seeing external things, harbors no admiration or lust,
then he is untouched by the defilements of form,
and his original purity—tranquil, serene, and restored to its true unity—
remains unshaken.

When the ruler guards this true unity,
the people’s hearts will not be disturbed,
and the wind of simplicity and sincerity will prevail.

Yan Jun Ping said:
*'If the age does not exalt the worthy, the people will not vie;
if they do not vie, they will not contend;
if they do not contend, there will be no disorder.
If the age does not prize wealth, the people will not desire;
if they do not desire, they will not seek;
if they do not seek, they will not steal.
If the age abandons the five flavors, the people will have no joy;
if they have no joy, they will have no pleasure;
if they have no pleasure, they will not indulge in licentiousness.
This is the natural order.'*

*The Hong Lie Jie* says:
*'When Zi Pei requested permission to drink with King Zhuang of Chu,
the king granted it. Zi Pei bowed and stood facing north in the hall,
saying: "Earlier, the king granted my request,
yet now you do not fulfill it—
have I committed some offense?"

The king replied: "I heard you were enjoying yourself at Jiang Tai.
Jiang Tai overlooks the mountains to the south,
commanding the vast lands, with the Yangtze to the left and the Huai to the right—
its pleasures make one forget death.
A man of my meager virtue cannot bear such joys.
I fear that if I stay, I will not return."
Thus it is said: *"Do not display desirable things, lest the heart be disturbed."*

Fu Yi’s *Yin Yi* says:
*"The ancient text reads: 'Make the people’s hearts undisturbed.'
The River Shore Master and Kai Yuan Imperial editions read: 'Make the heart undisturbed,' which is also acceptable."*

Thus, the Sage’s governance begins with emptying the heart.
The governance of the Great Sage first refines the self,
then extends to family and state.

To empty the heart is to banish all deceitful thoughts,
not to let the mind chase after external things,
but to remain inwardly still—
where desires vanish, the spirit settles naturally,
and the heart becomes empty.

Zhuangzi said:
*"In an empty chamber, purity arises;
auspicious omens linger."*

This means that when the heart is empty, pristine whiteness emerges,
and blessings take root.

To fill the belly:
The Sage’s virtue and power are internally abundant,
the five spirits tranquil,
contentment effortless and self-sufficient,
with no room for greed or love—
thus it is said: *"Fill the belly."*

To weaken the will:
The will is the mind’s affair—
when the mind acts, it is called will.
To ensure that every thought and deed
adheres to humility, tranquility, gentleness, and weakness—
then the Dao is preserved.

To strengthen the bones:
The bones are the body’s framework.
When harmony and sufficiency are complete,
the body is nourished, and the spirit robust—
then the bones naturally grow strong.

Always let the people be without knowledge and without desire:
The Sage’s constant cultivation of the self and emptying of the heart
is to restore the people to simplicity and sincerity,
so they transform joyfully of their own accord.

The saying goes:
*"If one first rectifies himself,
what difficulty is there in governance?"*

Though the learned may possess knowledge of exaltation
or feign deceitful appearances,
once they are touched by the wind of tranquility and simplicity,
their hearts grow dull, their bodies wither—
they dare not stir their restless, desiring minds.

To act with *non-action* is to govern without fail.
To act with *non-action* is to walk the Dao of *non-action*.
*Non-action* means not overstepping one’s nature.
When nature is not overstepped, the natural order is complete—
and when complete, all actions are *non-action*.

If all things act with *non-action*,
then the hearts of exaltation, prizing, and greed
are naturally extinguished,
and the great wind of simplicity prevails—
who would say governance fails?"

「When Xie Tunan said: *"If one does not exalt the worthy, the hearts of the people will not be disturbed."*

For a ruler to employ the worthy and utilize their abilities is a natural duty, but he must not establish the name of exaltation. Once the name of exaltation is set, then the petty will seize upon it to claim the title for themselves. If one prizes and honors things of rare value that bring no benefit, then those who covet what is difficult to obtain will inevitably think of stealing and taking by force. If one exposes the senses to what is merely desirable yet unprofitable, it will stir the heart and lead to those who seek to disrupt what is done.

The ruler’s intentions must be cautious indeed. Therefore, the sage acts with utmost sincerity—
to empty the heart is to prevent desires from entering within,
to fill the belly is to ensure that the Dao’s nourishment does not fail within,
to weaken the will is to let intentions not stray into arrogance or submission,
to strengthen the bones is to cultivate vigor without weariness in labor.
Thus does the sage govern—
ever making the people reach the state of *non-treatment*.

Desires arise from knowledge;
without knowledge, there are no desires.
If the ruler transforms with *non-knowledge* and *non-desire*,
then the people respond with *non-knowledge* and *non-desire*.
Even if he cannot make them utterly free of knowledge,
those among them who boast of cleverness and display ability
will still be subtly diminished and transformed,
until they retreat to the point where they dare not act.
This so-called "knowledge" is but the private scheming of blood and *qi*—
not the true *virtue* of the heart.

If they dare to act, it will surely harm governance.
Therefore, when the ruler governs with *non-action*,
there is nothing the people cannot be brought to *non-treatment*.

Indeed, the people follow not the ruler’s commands,
but his inclinations.
If his intentions are not cautious,
then his words and deeds will inevitably invite excess.
The sages of old sincerely cultivated their intentions to rectify their hearts,
rectified their hearts to cultivate their persons,
cultivated their persons to govern the state and pacify the world—
their spirit and thought concentrated in one hall,
while their moral influence spread far and wide across the ten thousand *li*,
responding to the slightest movement without delay.
Later rulers, however, exhausted their emotions and indulged their desires,
doing whatever they pleased,
and yet blamed the world for its difficulty to transform,
and the people for their stubbornness.
Alas, how confused they were!

Lin Yongqing said: *"If one does not exalt the worthy, the people will not vie—
then there will be nothing that is not governed."*

*Exaltation* means *boasting*.
If I boast of the worthy, then I will surely arouse contention throughout the world.
Yu alone did not boast, and thus none could vie with him in ability.
This is the meaning.

If I prize rare treasures,
then all will have desires to obtain them,
and the consequence will be theft.
These two lines reveal the intent of what follows:
*"If one does not see what is desirable, then the heart naturally settles.
Not seeing what is desirable prevents the heart from being disturbed."*
These eight characters are most excellent.

To empty the heart is to have no thoughts of admiration.
To fill the belly is to satisfy hunger for food.
To weaken the will is to avoid striving for competition.
To strengthen the bones is to nourish one’s vitality.
It speaks of the sages of antiquity,
who merely ensured the people were well-fed,
with no other thoughts of admiration,
and whose strength was robust yet unspent in competition—
thus their people were pure and simple,
without knowledge or desire,
though cleverness might occasionally stir within them,
their knowledge, though sprouting in the heart,
would not dare to manifest in action.

The sage’s governance of the world was thus,
and yet the sage himself had no place in the world for his heart.
In his governance, he acted entirely with *non-action*,
and thus there was nothing that was not governed.
*"Not seeing what is desirable prevents the heart from being disturbed."*
This describes how the sage taught his people.

*To employ* means to guide the people.
Not exalting the worthy,
not honoring rare treasures—
all these stem from fear of stirring desires.
Stirring desires is not limited to these two matters;
they are merely stated as examples.

Laozi lamented the confusion of the later ages,
and thus pondered the simplicity of antiquity.
His words, however, were somewhat excessive,
and thus did not fully capture the sage’s Way.

Fan Yingyuan said: *"Not exalting the worthy prevents the people from vying.*
*Exaltation* means *preference*.
The worthy are those with *ability*.
Again, according to the *Shuo Wen* ["Explanations of Texts"], they are those with *many talents*.
*Vying* means *competition*—
if one favors those with slight talents and abilities,
then the people will compete to cultivate these talents and abilities,
and not seek the natural Way.

Moreover, slight talents and abilities can be used by others,
but those with slight talents and abilities cannot be relied upon to use others.
To strive for talent while neglecting *virtue* is not the conduct of a gentleman.
If the ruler does not favor those with slight talents and abilities,
then the people will not vie.

Not honoring rare treasures prevents the people from becoming thieves.
Rare treasures refer to gold and jade—
if one honors them, then the people will love the objects
and suffer from their lack,
leading them to theft.

Therefore, the sage’s governance reaches its peak in strengthening the bones.
*Governance* means *order*—
ordering oneself to order the world.
If the ruler has no exaltation,
then the people will not indulge in vain imaginings—
desires are removed,
is this not also emptying the heart?

If the ruler cherishes *Dao* and *virtue*,
then the people will embrace simplicity—
the natural order is preserved.
Is this not also filling the belly?

If the ruler maintains gentleness and harmony,
then the people will be transformed,
and their *qi* will not be violent—
is this not also weakening the will?

If the ruler has no fondness for desires,
then the people will be transformed,
and their bodies will naturally be robust and healthy—
is this not also strengthening the bones?

If one can achieve this,
then one can make the people without knowledge or desire.
These four lines have those who interpret them solely in terms of personal cultivation,
yet the text before and after clearly conveys the idea of rectifying oneself and transforming the people.

Ever making the people without knowledge—
then they dare not act.
For the people, when they know of exaltation,
when they see what is desirable,
they will vie and steal,
and bring chaos.
Therefore, one must always guide them to have no false knowledge or false desires,
and prevent clever and cunning men from acting presumptuously.

To govern with *non-action* is to have nothing that is not governed.
The sage has no words of exaltation,
yet the people do not see what is desirable—
following the natural order in responding to things,
there is always a proper path to take,
and thus it is *non-action* that prevails.»

For the Way to emerge from *non-action*,
then all undertakings are accomplished,
all things fall into harmony,
and thus nothing remains undone.

Xue Yongzai said:
*"To not exalt the worthy makes the people not contend—*
*then their hearts are not disordered.*
*To not exalt the worldly worthy,*
*then the people will not contend.*
*To not prize rare and difficult-to-obtain goods,*
*then the people will not steal.*
*To not display what is desirable,*
*then the hearts of the people will not be disordered.*
Thus, the sage’s governance is to fortify their resolve—
*to govern the state is like governing oneself.*

*Empty their hearts,*
*then their virtue has ample capacity.*
*Fill their bellies,*
*then they will not covet lands.*
*Weaken their wills,*
*then the Way of governance remains gentle.*
*Strengthen their bones,*
*then their limbs will not grow slack.*

*Always make the people without knowledge and without desire—*
*then nothing will remain ungoverned.*
*In accord with ignorance,*
*their virtue does not stray.*
*In accord with desirelessness,*
*this is called natural simplicity.*

If one can make the people thus,
even the wise will not dare to act presumptuously.

*Without desire, the world is sufficient.*
*Without action, all things transform.*
*Depth and stillness bring the people peace—*
is this not the governance of *non-action*?

Xiu Xiu An said:
*"To not exalt the worthy makes the people not contend—*
*then nothing will remain ungoverned.*

Those who embrace the Way and practice the teaching of *non-speech*,
*are internally empty and externally compliant,*
*without likes or dislikes,*
*thus they do not exalt the worthy,*
*nor prize rare and difficult-to-obtain goods.*

If one has likes or exalts,
*it is due to emotions and perceptions,*
*and one cannot avoid*
*giving rise to ability,*
*to greedy pursuit,*
*or to contention for merit,*
*or to theft.*

For those advancing the Way and nurturing virtue,
*they must first let no thought arise,*
*reach the state of utmost emptiness,*
*refined subtlety and mysterious penetration,*
*and then attain self-cultivation.*

*Is not the spirit of clarity precious?*
If there are thoughts of love or desire,
*then emotions will be stirred,*
*and the true heart will be confused.*

Thus, the sage cultivates oneself, harmonizes the family,
governs the state, and brings peace to the world—
*emptying their heart,*
*without self, their measure is vast,*
*their governance is *non-action*, yet all things transform naturally.*

*To hold the Way in one’s bosom,*
*is to fill their belly.*
*To expand the virtue of non-contentiousness,*
*is to weaken their will.*
*To vigorously practice this Way,*
*is to strengthen their bones.*

If one can do this,
*they extinguish perception and have no knowledge,*
*and emotions are annihilated.*

Zhu Boqiu said:
*"To not exalt the worthy makes the people not contend—*
*then nothing will remain ungoverned.*

The ancients treasured innate worthiness,
seeing the worthy and striving to emulate them.
But here it says ‘not exalt’—what does this mean?
*For those of this age,*
*many exalt their own worthiness,*
*thus stirring contention,*
*and jealousy arises from disorder.*
*Only by not exalting one’s own worthiness*
*can one recognize the true worthy of the world.*

It does not mean to abandon the worthy in the wild,
*nor to not employ them.*
*In times of moral decay,*
*so-called worthy ones are not necessarily true,*
*and those who are exalted are not necessarily sincere.*
*The ruler feigns seeking worthy men,*
*the scholars bear the ambition of their own worthiness,*
*with deceit meeting deceit,*
*all sink into vice,*
*and worthiness becomes an empty title—*
*how can it benefit the family and state?*

To teach ‘not to exalt one’s own worthiness’
*is to clarify the source and open the path*
*for the four seas’ worthy to come.*

*Goods circulate in the world,*
*abundant or scarce,*
*to provide for the people’s use.*
*Here, ‘not to prize’ refers*
*specifically to rare and costly treasures—*
*inch-long pearls, foot-wide jade,*
*southern gold, great cowries,*
*beautiful sounds and beasts,*
*and objects of indulgence,*
*which bring no benefit to the family and state,*
*no relief to hunger and cold.*
*If the ruler takes them,*
*the people below will follow,*
*leading to violence and theft,*
*and the world’s hearts will be stirred by greed,*
*with theft spreading between ruler and people.*

But as for flowing circulation,
*like water and grain,*
*silk, hemp, rice, and cloth—*
*the people rely on these for life and sustenance.*
*They are never neglected,*
*thus it is said:*
*‘Not to prize rare goods,*
*but to value useful ones,*
*to appropriately employ and utilize,*
*ensuring abundance in homes—*
*then where is the theft to come from?’*

In later ages, greed and extravagance ruined standards,
*while lustful desires eroded the heart.*
*The world was in chaos,*
*all alike in one pattern.*
*Only those who study and know the Way*
*have clear boundaries,*
*and will not overstep them.*
*If one seeks indulgence and loses resolve,*
*then food is taken merely to fill hunger,*
*clothing is worn only for warmth,*
*homes shelter against wind,*
*and the two blessings of joy and fortune*
*are measured by abundance or scarcity.*
*What they enjoy is limited,*
*what they seek is easily satisfied,*
*their hearts harbor no covetousness—*
*what can stir disorder in them?*

*The ruler does not exalt the worthy,*
*then the people below do not contend for renown.*
*The ruler does not prize goods,*
*then the people below do not contend for profit.*
*The ruler does not display what is desirable,*
*then the hearts of the people are not disordered.*

All this stems from *emptying the heart,*
*so it does not receive external things,*
*and thus what is desirable finds no entry.*

*Empty the heart,*
*then the original spirit dwells.*
*Fill the belly,*
*then the original qi gathers.*

*To strengthen their resolve while weakening their will,*
*is the means to invite harmony.*
*To strengthen their bones while letting them bear labor,*
*is the means to stand firm.*

*Empty the heart and weaken the will,*
*to make the people without knowledge.*
*Fill the belly and strengthen the bones,*
*to make the people without desire.*

Then even if there are those with knowledge,
*they will not dare to intrude*
*with their own actions*
*upon the ruler’s *non-action*.*

*If the ruler can uphold the Way of *non-action*,*
*practice what they have no need to do,*
*then all undertakings in the world*
*are without fail.*

*The final sentence in the ancient text reads:*
*‘nothing remains undone.’*
*Its meaning extends beyond mere governance.*
*Niu Miaozhuan said:*

*"To not exalt the worthy,*
*to make the people not contend.*
*The worthy are bright, sensitive, and wise—*
*their talents and abilities.*
*‘Not to exalt’ means*
*not to boast of oneself,*
*a humble phrase.*
*If one is humble,*
*then they shine.*
*Why would the people contend?*

Thus, the gentleman does not magnify their own deeds,
nor exalt their own merits,
*yielding to the worthy,*
*lowering themselves to honor others.*
*If one lowers themselves,*
*then the people will respect and honor them.*

The earlier scholars said:
*"I am worthy and capable—*
*what worthiness or capability do I have beyond myself?*
*I am exalted—*
*what exaltation do I have beyond myself?*
*I am honored above others—*
*yet why should I honor myself?*
*If I boast of this,*
*then I am not worthy.*
*If I am not worthy,*
*then people will reject me—*
*is this not contention?"*

This is the saying of *"to not exalt the worthy, making the people not contend."*

*"To not prize rare and difficult-to-obtain goods,*
*to make the people not steal.*
*Like the night-light pearl,*
*or the moonlit jade—*
*these are indeed rare and difficult-to-obtain goods."*

The **Master Mencius** said: *"If one does not covet, even if rewarded, they will not steal—how then could there be thieves in the world?"* Thus, the **Rujia** treasure not gold and jade but take **loyalty and trustworthiness** as their treasure.

In ancient times, a **Song man** presented a jade to **Zi Han**, who said: *"I take ‘not being greedy’ as my treasure, while you take jade as yours. If we exchange, both of us lose our treasures."* He declined and did not accept it. This is truly the saying of *"not prizing rare and difficult-to-obtain goods."*

**Zhuangzi** said: *"Abandon the sage’s wisdom, and great thieves will cease their craft. Shatter jade and destroy pearls, and petty thieves will not rise."* Is this not the meaning of *"making the people not steal"*?

*Not seeing what is desirable* prevents the heart from being disordered.
The heart is the sovereign of the body, and desire is where the mind wanders.
Generally, when the eyes see something, the heart must ponder it;
when the heart ponders, the mind must act;
when the mind acts, that is called desire.
When desire obscures the heart, clarity is lost—how could it not be disordered?

The *Record of Music* states:
*"Man is born tranquil—this is Heaven’s nature.
When stirred by things, he moves—this is the nature of desire."*
Thus, those who practice greatly must always be cautious in their outward gaze,
so as not to see desirable things,
then naturally the body and mind will be serene,
free from vexation and untroubled.
This is called *"not seeing what is desirable."*

**Mencius** also said: *"Nothing nourishes the heart better than few desires."*
This is the same meaning.

Therefore, the **Sage’s governance** lies in keeping the heart empty.
The Sage is one of profound virtue, wisdom, and clarity.
Because they follow Heaven and embody the **Dao/Way**, they always keep their heart empty.
What is meant by *"empty heart"* is to discard the false.
For there is no principle outside the heart,
yet the Sage possesses a heart that exhausts principle.
All principles under Heaven are what the heart contains.
Only by keeping it empty can they be nurtured,
so that no private intention obstructs them,
then the mysteries of Heaven and Earth can all be discerned.

**Laozi** said:
*"When the body is empty, all things come.
When the heart is without, harmonious qi returns."*
This is the meaning of the Sage’s cultivation—
emptying the heart and governing the body.

**Filling the abdomen.**
By *"filling the abdomen,"* it is not meant to gorge on rich foods
and stuff the five viscera,
but to accumulate essence and gather qi to form the **True Self**.
Thus, the Sage always honors their **qi**, values their form,
treasures their life, and cherishes their spirit,
so that the **True Self’s realm** is long preserved,
vital energy is refined,
the nine orifices are unobstructed,
and the body attains **born-again spirit**—
this is the Sage’s governance.

**Laozi** said:
*"My life is in myself, not given by Heaven and Earth.
I neither see nor hear,
so my spirit does not leave the body,
and I endure with the Dao.
I divide with Heaven and Earth,
governing with one breath,
preserving my root foundation."*
The **root foundation** refers to the doctrine of **spirit, qi, and essence**—
this is the meaning of *"filling the abdomen."*

**Weakening the will.**
*"Weakening"* means *"holding firm."*
The **will** is the leader of **qi**,
and **qi** is what fills the body.
Now, those who stumble or rush—
this is **qi**.
Those who practice well
must, at dawn before engaging with things,
when **qi** is clear and bright,
constantly hold their will,
not exhausting their **qi**,
so that it becomes vast and unobstructed,
not leading to stagnation or loss.
Then, perhaps, within the three hundred sixty bones,
there will be no blockages.

**Mencius** said: *"If nourishment is obtained, nothing fails to grow.
If nourishment is lost, nothing fails to wither."*
**Confucius** said: *"Hold fast, and it remains; release, and it perishes.
Its coming and going have no fixed time—
who knows its direction?
Only the heart is like this."*
This is the saying of *"weakening the will."*

**Strengthening the bones.**
By *"strengthening the bones,"* it is meant to grasp firmly, steady the feet,
raise the waist and arch the chest—
this is the path of cultivation.
For the Sage’s governance
first empties the heart to establish principle,
then fills the abdomen to solidify essence,
weakens the will to preserve **qi**,
and strengthens the bones to walk the **Dao**.

Yet, is there no explanation for the way of *"strengthening the bones"*?
When great practitioners complete their work,
they then withdraw fire and extract lead,
allowing the **Original Qi** to ascend from the **Tailbone** along the **Spinal Column** and **Upper Gate** into the **Mud Ball**,
where **qi** transforms into **saliva**,
which is then drawn from the upper palate,
held in the mouth,
swallowed three times after gently tapping the teeth,
and directed with intent to the **Elixir Field**,
where it is further nurtured by the **Fire and Water** cycles—
this is called *"Jade-Liquid Reverted Elixir."*
This is the meaning of *"strengthening the bones."*

Always let the people be without knowledge and without desire.

The unknowing is purity, the desireless is simplicity, and purity and simplicity are the Way of *wuwei*.

To always govern the people thus means that the Sage first practices it himself, and only then can he make the people unknowing and desireless, pure and simple in *wuwei*.

For only when the ruler’s virtue is manifest can he make the people’s virtue manifest.

As in the age of primal antiquity, when the world was in *wuwei*—when the ruler above was in *wuwei*, then those below were also in *wuwei*.

The ruler is like the wind, the people like the grass.
When the wind does not bend the grass, such a thing does not exist in the world.

The customs of the unknowing, the winds of simplicity and purity—these belong to the age of supreme antiquity and its virtue.

Zhuangzi said: In the age of supreme virtue, the worthy are not honored, the capable are not employed. The ruler is like a branch of a tree, the people like wild deer—straightforward without knowing it as *ren*, loving one another without knowing it as *yi*, sincere without knowing it as *zhong*, faithful without knowing it as *xin*. They move clumsily yet govern one another without calling it a blessing.

Thus, they act without striving, serve without leaving a trace. Filial sons do not flatter their parents, loyal ministers do not fawn on their lords—this is the custom of purity and simplicity.

Therefore, the Sage first transforms himself from above, and thus it is said: *"Always govern the people by making them unknowing and desireless."*

To make the wise dare not act.

In the age of antiquity, the customs were pure, and there were no distinctions of *san gang*—lord-subject, father-son, husband-wife—and no visible *wu chang*—*ren, yi, li, zhi, xin*. All shared equally, yet did not know how they obtained it; all were born naturally, yet did not know how they came to be. Dwelling with beasts, mingling with all things, how could they know of noble and base?

In their shared unknowing, their virtue did not depart; in their shared desirelessness, this is called *suzhu*—the uncarved block—and the people returned to their nature.

If such pure and simple folk were to encounter clever and bright scholars, though they possessed knowledge, they would have no use for it.

Thus it is said: *"To make the wise dare not act."*

To practice *wuwei* is to have nothing that cannot be governed.

The virtue of the Sage-King takes heaven and earth as its root, *Dao* and virtue as its master, and *wuwei* as its constant.

To be in *wuwei* is to govern the world with abundance.
To act with *wei* is to be used by the world yet remain insufficient.

*Wuwei* is the balance of heaven and earth, the ultimate of *Dao* and virtue. To understand this and sit in the south-facing hall is to be Yao as sovereign.
To understand this and face north is to be Shun as minister.

To hold this in high station is the virtue of the Emperor and Son of Heaven.
To hold this in low station is the *Dao* of the ancient and pure Sage-Kings.

To retreat and dwell in leisure among rivers, seas, mountains, and forests is the way of the recluse.
To advance and govern the world is to achieve great deeds and a resounding name, uniting all under heaven.

Thus it is said: *"To practice wuwei is to have nothing that cannot be governed."*

Yang Zhiren said: *"To not honor the worthy makes the people not contend, and thus nothing remains ungoverned."*

To not honor the worthy means that wealth and nobility are not desired, titles and emoluments are not possessed. One does not attend the Son of Heaven above, nor pay respects to ministers below. Thus one possesses the virtue of non-contention.

To not prize rare goods means that strange treasures, precious metals, and fine jade are but external things. The heart is serene, the people content. Externally, no desires are seen; internally, the mind is undisturbed.

The enlightened see yet do not see, moving freely in all directions.
The ancients said: *"If I have no mind toward all things, how can all things not surround me?"*

The Sage’s practice is to empty the heart of all attachments, fill the belly to preserve the essence, weaken the will to remain humble, and strengthen the bones to nurture the boundless.

My heart is pure, the people’s hearts are simple. Without desire, without knowledge, the wise dare not act.

To be in *wuwei* yet accomplish all is to have nothing that cannot be governed.

The *Book of Documents* says: *"Yanzi’s limbs were exhausted, his brilliance discarded, his form abandoned, his wisdom set aside—this is to not honor the worthy."*

Eating coarse grains, drinking from a gourd, dwelling in a humble lane—though others could not endure the hardship, Yan Hui did not change his joy.

To not prize rare goods is to not steal; to not see desire is to not be disturbed—this is the way.

To nourish the proper with ease is humility;
to be lowly yet honored is the Sage’s way of emptying the heart, filling the belly, weakening the will, and strengthening the bones—without knowledge, without desire, in *wuwei* yet without failing to govern.

Yu Qingzhong said: *"To not honor the worthy makes the people not contend, and thus nothing remains ungoverned."*

To not honor the worthy makes the people not contend—this means that if you do not boast of your abilities, none will contend with you in skill.

To not prize rare goods makes the people not steal—this means that if one does not covet, even if rewarded, one will not take it, as Gongsun Long said.

To not see what is desirable makes the heart not disturbed—this is the most critical teaching of the *Taishang*.

Zigong, seeing the splendor of the capital and taking delight, saw what was desirable and his heart was disturbed. Yet upon returning and hearing the Master’s *Dao*, he found joy—seeing no desire, his heart was undisturbed.

Damo faced the wall at Shaolin for nine years—this too was the meaning.

The training of the worthy is like my sole virtue being laborious. Generally, those who seek to excel in all things are called worthy—such as those who love grandeur and achievement, who exhaust armies and wage wars, always seeking to surpass predecessors, not merely boasting of cleverness and strength.

Han Wen, emulating the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s quietude, used humble words and thick gifts, and pacified distant peoples, yet said, *"I am a concubine’s son of the High Emperor"*—this was to not honor the worthy.

Qi Gaozu said: *"If I were to govern the world for ten years, I would make gold as common as dirt."* This was to not prize rare goods.

Generally, women are what people desire, as are wealth and nobility. Dogs, horses, music, and women; sons, daughters, jade, and silk; towering halls and carved walls—all are enough to arouse desire. Only by seeing nothing externally can the mind remain unshaken within.

The Sage’s governance of the world—what other Way could there be?
To receive them into the realm of thoughtlessness and carelessness, to empty their hearts.
Yet for the eight-mouth household, one must ensure they know no hunger—
for banditry arises from poverty.

Transform them with gentleness, teach them with softness, to weaken their resolve.
Yet one must also compel them to labor their sinews and bones in service,
lest they grow fat from ease and dwell in idleness without discipline.

The four characters—*emptiness, fullness, weakness, strength*—
are like mother and child.
To fill their bellies and strengthen their bones—
this is where the Sage’s meticulous and subtle considerations lie.

Govern thus, and one sees the people wandering in a state of unknowing and ignorance,
with few thoughts and scant desires.
Though they possess cleverness, there is nothing for it to apply itself.

All this is the Sage’s governance through *wuwei*—
how could the world not be governed?

The *Six Emptinesses* say:
*"Do not honor the worthy, so the people do not contend.*
For a state must have its worthy ministers to assist in governance—
if not, there is no way to achieve order.
To not honor the worthy is not to reject the worthy—
it is merely to not exalt them.
If the ruler opens the door to honoring the worthy,
then those below will harbor ambitions to advance,
hence it is said: *‘Do not honor the worthy, so the people do not contend.’*

*Do not prize rare goods, so the people do not steal.*
Wealth and goods—all under heaven desire them.
If the ruler values and cherishes them,
then those below, though desiring them, find them hard to obtain—
and difficulty in obtaining them stirs the private impulse to pilfer.
If the ruler regards wealth as common as dirt,
neither prizing nor loving it,
and makes goods easy to obtain,
then how could the people harbor thieving intentions?

*Do not display what is desirable, so the heart remains undisturbed.*
This has two interpretations.
One interprets *‘see’* as the ruler not displaying what is desirable to the people,
so their hearts naturally settle.
If the ruler displays what is desirable,
then those below will emulate it—
how could their hearts not be disturbed?

Another interpretation of *‘see’* speaks of self-cultivation:
when music, women, and luxuries fill one’s sight,
if one does not see what is desired, the heart remains settled.
If one sees what is desired, how could it not be disturbed?

Thus, the Sage’s governance is at its strongest in fortifying the bones.

Therefore, ancient Sages governed the state by first governing themselves,
and to govern themselves, they first emptied their hearts—
not allowing human desires to agitate them,
so the heart naturally becomes empty.

Empty, still—
the heart still, then *qi* settles;
*qi* settled, then the belly naturally fills.
Thus, to empty the heart, fill the belly, and weaken the will—
this means not competing with things.
Without competition, *shenqi* harmonizes and rejoices,
and blood and essence flow abundantly, marrow fills, and bones grow strong—
this is the true way of nurturing life,
a certainty that must be believed.
To govern the state thus is to bring wealth to the nation and peace to the people—
what more could one ask?

To always keep the people in a state of unknowing and desirelessness
is to achieve perfect governance.
Yet the people’s desires are inevitable—
how then can one make them desireless and ignorant?

Still, if the ruler does not honor the worthy, does not prize goods,
and does not display what is desirable,
and the people follow above as grass follows the wind,
their nature returns to simplicity,
each content in their place,
clothed and fed, wandering at ease—
what knowing, what desiring would they have?

Yet if the ruler’s conduct is sincere and the people remain untransformed,
even if they have knowledge and desire, they dare not act upon it—
transformation is the work of many.

To act through *wuwei* is to govern completely—
for if the ruler exalts the worthy, prizes goods, and displays what is desirable,
yet truly practices *wuwei*,
then the world will govern itself.

Thus it is said:
*"To act through wuwei is to govern completely."*

Su Jingjing said:
*"From ‘Do not honor the worthy, so the people do not contend’
to ‘then there will be nothing that is not governed.’*
This chapter focuses on Laozi’s original intent:
*‘Do not display what is desirable, so the heart remains undisturbed.’*

The worthy are those who excel beyond others.
If I exalt those who excel beyond others,
then those who do not excel will rise to contend.
Rare goods are treasures.
If I prize treasures, the people will conceive thieving intentions.
This is like Ji Kangzi’s concern over theft,
where Confucius said:
*"If you yourself do not desire them,
even if rewarded, they will not steal."*
This is the same meaning.

Generally, if the people’s desires are not displayed,
their hearts naturally remain unagitated.

The *Yijing*’s *Gèn* hexagram says:
*"Gèn its back, it does not grasp its body;
it walks through its courtyard, yet does not see its person—
no blame."*
The commentators say:
*"Gèn* means to stop.
The heart’s desires are always stopped where the eyes do not see.
The back is where nothing is seen—
if seen, then desire arises,
and once desire arises, it cannot be stopped.
*Gèn its back*—it does not grasp its body—
meaning it does not see its body.
If the eyes cannot even see the body,
then desire naturally does not arise.
Though the courtyard is near and one walks past people,
they are not seen because *gèn* stops the back.
If one sees the splendor outside and takes delight,
then the heart becomes agitated.
When external things do not intrude,
the heart remains undisturbed,
and there is no fault.
This is Laozi’s *‘Do not display what is desirable, so the heart remains undisturbed.’*

Laozi speaks of ancient Sages’ governance,
striving to make the people’s hearts empty, their bellies full,
their wills weak, and their bones strong.
An empty heart means not allowing external things to disturb it.
A full belly means merely ensuring the people are fed.
A weak will means making the people not see what is desirable,
so they do not contend.
Strong bones mean merely ensuring the people have strength to bear burdens.
If the people are ignorant and desireless, they become simple and practical,
forming customs naturally.
Though there may be clever and cunning among them—
one in a hundred—
the simple and practical far outnumber the clever and cunning,
so who would dare to rebel?

Even today, the people of the mountains and forests differ from those of the markets and cliffs in their sincerity and cleverness—
not because of anything else,
but because the market people see much that is desirable,
while the mountain people see little that is desirable.

「Thus the actions of the Sage are all in tranquility and non-action, and naturally all things are governed without effort. The Sage does not exalt the worthy, nor treasure rare goods—both measures ensure the people do not see what is desirable, and their hearts remain undisturbed.

How unlike the later ages, where rewards for merit and incentives for ability only provoke the world’s strife, while valuing rare and costly wealth only spawns thievery—these are not the ways of non-action and tranquil governance.

*The *Shíyí* [Gathering of Lost Sayings] states: The Master of Virtue said: "Empty the heart, fill the belly"—this is the same as the Sage not exalting, not treasuring, and not showing what is desirable, thereby making the people ignorant and desireless. When they have no knowledge to covet, they do not dare to act.

Some say "empty the heart to nurture the Dao," which, though not harmful in principle, is not the true meaning of this passage.

*From *Zhūzǐ Pángzhèng* [Collateral Proofs of the Masters]:
The *Zhuangzi* says: In the age of perfect virtue, the Sage does not exalt the worthy, nor employ the capable. The ruler is like a branch of a tree, the people like wild deer. Correctness is upheld without calling it righteousness, mutual love is practiced without calling it benevolence, substance is honored without calling it loyalty, fittingness is observed without calling it trustworthiness, and spontaneous movements are guided without calling them gifts. Thus, actions are performed without boasting, and deeds are done without seeking praise.

*The *Han Feizi* says: A villager of Song found a rough piece of jade and presented it to the Lord of the State, Zi Han, who refused it. The villager said: "This is a treasure! It should be made into a nobleman’s vessel, not used by commoners." Zi Han replied: "You consider jade a treasure, but I consider not accepting your jade a treasure." Thus, the villager desired jade, while Zi Han did not—hence the saying, "Desire what is not desired, and value what is difficult to obtain."

*The *Wénzǐ* says: A true man of virtue is serene and without thought, calm and without concern. He takes heaven as his roof, earth as his carriage, the four seasons as his steeds, and yin-yang as his reins. He travels where there are no paths, wanders where there are no traces, and exits where there are no gates. To take heaven as his roof means to cover all things without limit; to take earth as his carriage means to bear all things without burden. The four seasons as steeds mean to harness all transformations; yin-yang as reins means to provide for all needs. Thus, he moves swiftly without agitation, travels far without weariness, his limbs remain still, his wisdom undiminished—yet he shines brightly throughout the world. Grasping the essence of the Dao, he gazes upon the boundless realm, so that all worldly affairs are beyond his doing. Following nature’s spontaneity, he guides it, and all changes of things are beyond his control. Seizing its core and returning to it, the Sage cultivates his inner foundation without adornment in externals, fortifying his spirit while suppressing his perceptions. Hence, he is detached and effortless yet accomplishes all things; he governs without action yet nothing remains ungoverned.

What is meant by non-action is not to act before things; what is meant by non-governance is not to alter nature; what is meant by nothing remaining ungoverned is to follow things’ natural course.

Shí Tán said: Not exalting the worthy prevents the people from striving. Not treasuring rare goods prevents thievery. Not showing what is desirable prevents the heart from being disturbed. The previous passage expounded the principle of *wúmíng* [namelessness], while this one expounds the principle of *wúdù* [desirelessness]. To exalt the worthy makes their names desirable, and the people contend for them. To treasure rare goods makes profit desirable, and the people will steal for it. Only by not showing names as desirable does the name not disturb their hearts; only by not showing profit as desirable does profit not disturb their hearts. What is desired and can disturb the heart is not limited to these two. Let these two suffice as examples.

Lín Yōngzhāi interpreted "not exalting the worthy" as "not self-praising," and Huáng Màocái explained "not showing what is desirable" as "not seeing that the world has what is desirable"—both interpretations are superior.

Thus, the Sage’s governance empties the heart, fills the belly, weakens the will, and strengthens the bones. When desire does not disturb the heart, the heart is empty; when the heart is not overcome by desire, it has a steadfast center and is full. Hence, "fill the belly." When the will does not seek externals, the will is weak; though weak, if the *qi* is not moved by the will, the bones grow ever stronger—hence, "strengthen the bones." The Sage constantly makes the people ignorant and desireless, so even those who know do not dare to act. If they are ignorant and desireless, though they may have knowledge, they have no use for it. Practicing non-action, nothing remains ungoverned. The Sage’s governance is simply non-action. Yet he can make the people not be disturbed by what is desirable—this is what is meant by "nothing remains ungoverned."

The previous passage arose from the principle of *wúmíng* [namelessness], while this one arises from *wúdù* [desirelessness], yet both return to non-action. Non-action is indeed the embodiment of the Dao.

*End of Volume Eight of *Zhēnyì Jiéyì* [Collected Meanings of the True Classic of Dao and Virtue]. *Beginning of Volume Nine of *Zhēnyì Jiéyì*.*」

**Volume Nine of *Zhēnyì Jiéyì* [Collected Meanings of the True Classic of Dao and Virtue]**

**Chapter: *Dàochōng* [The Dao’s Purity]**

Master Yǒngyuǎn, with profound virtue along the Dao’s mysterious path, supervised the compilation by Sì Wěiyǒng, a minister of the *Guōnmì Yùanshū* [Imperial Secretariat]. The text was annotated by Dīng Yìdōng, a former *Tàifǔ Shì Bù* [Treasury Bureau Clerk] and *Guōnmì Yuàn Biānxiū* [Editor of the Secretariat], with critical notes appended.

**Critical Notes:**
The *Héshànggōng* [Master of the Yellow River] composed the *Chapter of the Nameless Source*, while Zhào Shí’ān [Master of the Real Forest] wrote the *Chapter on the Propagation of the Harmonious Dao*.

**Emperor Xuānzōng’s Commentary:**
The previous chapter elucidated that nobility and rank are not to be pursued—non-action reveals the ultimate truth. This chapter expounds that the wondrous origin’s function lies in action without contrivance. It begins with *Dàochōng* [The Dao’s Purity], demonstrating the principle of supreme emptiness as the root of all things. Next, it speaks of *cuòjiě* [dulling and releasing], clarifying how purity in application resolves discord, concluding with the analogy of the *Xiàngdì* [August Sovereign] to guide all to its intent.

**Du Guāngtíng’s Exegesis:**
The Dao’s operation is boundless—vast as heaven and earth, subtle as a hair’s tip. In its natural repose, it neither lacks nor overflows. Applied to the body, it merges light and dust into unity; within the self, it transforms sharpness into harmony. Stretching across countless eons, it precedes even the *Xiàngdì*, standing first among all teachings. Thus, all existence finds its ultimate refuge in the Dao.

*Qu* [trend/tendency] means *xiàng* [to turn toward].

**Zhang Chōngyìng’s Interpretation:**
This chapter teaches that from the sovereign to the commoner, all who embody the natural Dao must recognize its boundless, infinite nature—mysterious and formless, yet ever-present. Hence, it is called *wúyuán* [the Nameless Source].

The Dao’s purity, when applied, is never full—
Deep as the source, it seems the origin of all things.
Dulling their sharpness,
Releasing their entanglements,
Harmonizing their brilliance,
Unifying their dust.
Vague as if it exists—
I do not know whose child it is,
Yet it precedes the *Xiàngdì*.

**Critical Notes:**
*"Or not full"* (*huò bù yíng*)—alternate readings: *"as if not full"* (*sì bù yíng*), *"seems not full"* (*sì bù yíng*).
*"Vague as if it exists"* (*kān xī sì cún*)—alternate: *"seems to exist"* (*sì rú cún*).
*"Whose child"* (*shéi zhī zǐ*)—alternate: *"whose child, indeed"* (*qí shéi zhī zǐ*).

**Héshànggōng’s Explanation:**
*The Dao’s purity, when applied*—
*Purity* (*chōng*) means *zhōng* [centrality].
The Dao conceals its name, hides its merit—its function lies in centrality, never full.
*"Or"* (*huò*) means *cháng* [constant].
The Dao is ever modest and empty, never overflowing.
*Deep as the source*—
The Dao’s depth is unfathomable, yet it seems the ancestral root of all things.
*Dulling their sharpness*—
*Sharpness* (*ruì*) means *jìn* [advancement].
When people eagerly strive for fame and gain, their ambition must be tempered—this is the Dao’s way, not self-imposed.
*Releasing their entanglements*—
*Entanglements* (*fēn*) mean *jiēgēn* [rooted conflicts].
One must reflect on the Dao’s non-action to dissolve them.
*Harmonizing their brilliance*—

「Though one may possess a singular insightful wisdom (*dújiàn zhī míng*), one must know the depths of obscurity (*ànmèi*), lest they disrupt others with their arrogance (*bù dāng yǐ ruì luàn rén yě*).
**Equalize with the common dust.**
One must align with the multitude in their filth and dust (*tóng yú zhòngshù tóng gòuchén*), not set oneself apart in singularity (*bù dāng zì bié shū*).

**Serene as if it exists.**
Speak of it with tranquil stillness (*zhàn yān ruì ruò cún*), thus enduring eternally without decay (*gù néng chángcún bù wáng*).

**I do not know whose child it is.**
Laozi says, *"I know not whence it springs."* (*Wú zhīshì shuō bù zhī qí shēng*)

**Resembling the Sovereign before the Emperor.**
The Dao exists prior to the Celestial Sovereign (*Tiān Dì zhī xiān*), thus declaring the Dao as born before Heaven and Earth (*dào zì zài tiān dì zhī qián, cǐ yán dào nǎi xiān tiān dì shēng yě*).

**To this day, it abides—**
Because it remains serene and tranquil (*néng zhànrán ānjìng*), unburdened by labor, it seeks to guide people in refining their conduct (*xiūshēn fǎdào*).

**Heshang Gong’s further elucidation:**
The Dao’s purity, when applied—
Resembling the Sovereign before the Emperor (*zhì xiàng dì zhī xiān*).
He who grasps only one household’s measure (*zhí yījiā zhī liàng*) cannot govern the household;
He who grasps only one kingdom’s measure (*zhí yīguó zhī liàng*) cannot establish the kingdom.
**Exhausting strength to lift heavy burdens, yet failing to serve its purpose.**
Thus, though one may know all things are governed (*rén suī zhī wànwù zhì yě*), if governance does not follow the **Two Principles** (*èr yí zhī dào*), it cannot endure (*zé bù néng shàn yě*).
Earth, though substantial in form (*xíngpò*), without conforming to Heaven’s **virtue** (*dé*), cannot preserve its eternal tranquility (*bù néng wánqí níng*).
Heaven, though refined in essence (*jīngxiàng*), without conforming to the Dao’s **virtue** (*dé*), cannot sustain its purity (*bù néng bǎo qí jīng*).
**Purity applied—its use cannot be exhausted.**
**Fullness begets solidity, yet solidity brings overflow; thus purity applied again does not overflow—its boundless nature is now fully revealed.**
Though form be vast, it cannot encumber its essence (*xíng suī dà bù néng lèi qí tǐ*);
Though deeds be frequent, they cannot fill its measure (*shì suī yīn bù néng chōng qí liàng*).
All things abandon this and seek their sovereign—
Where is their sovereign’s abode?
Is it not profound as if resembling the root of all things (*bù yì shàn wànwù zhī zōng hū*)?

**The Commentary says:**
To temper without loss, to disperse without effort—
**Harmonizing its brilliance** without staining its essence (*hé guāng ér bù wū qí tǐ*),
**Equalizing with the dust** without altering its truth (*tóng chén ér bù yú qí zhēn*).
Is it not serene as if it exists (*bù yì zhàn yān ruì cún hū*)?

Earth adheres to its form (*xíng*), yet its **virtue** (*dé*) cannot surpass its capacity to sustain (*zài*).
Heaven upholds its essence (*xiàng*), yet its **virtue** (*dé*) cannot surpass its coverage (*fù*).
Neither Heaven nor Earth can reach it—
Is it not resembling the Sovereign before the Emperor (*bù yì shàn dì zhī xiān hū*)?
**Emperor** (*Dì*), here meaning the **Celestial Sovereign** (*Tiān Dì*).

**Emperor Tang Ming Huang’s Explanation:**
The Dao’s purity, when applied—
**Or** (*huò*) means **constantly** (*bù yíng*).
The Dao moves through **purity** (*chōng*), generating **harmonious qi** (*héqì*), and its use brings forth all things (*yòng shēng wànwù*), yet it never overflows with its merit (*yǒu shēngchéng zhī gōng, zēng bù yíngmǎn*).
**Saying "or" as if it exists**—
This is the Dao’s ineffable essence (*yú dào bù gǎn zhèngyán yě*).
**Profound as the source**—
**Profound** (*yuān*), here meaning **deep and tranquil** (*shēn jìng*).
The Dao constantly generates all things yet never overflows (*dào cháng shēng wànwù ér bù yíngmǎn*), its wondrous origin being profound and tranquil (*miàoběn yuān shēn jìng*), thus resembling the sovereign root of all things (*gù shì wànwù zhī zōngzhǔ yě*).

**The Commentary further expounds:**
Purity (*chōng*) is **emptiness** (*xū*).
It means the Dao employs **emptiness** (*xū*) as its function (*wéi yòng yě*).
**Harmonious qi**, being pure and empty (*héqì chōngxū*), thus serves as the Dao’s use (*gù wéi dào yòng*).
Its use generates all things (*yòng shēng wànwù*), and all things receive its merit (*wù bèi qí gōng*).
When discussing merit, things seem to doubt its brilliance (*lùn gōng zé wù yí qí guāngdà*), yet when speaking of purity, the Dao remains ever unoverflowing (*yǔ chōng zé dào cháng bù yíngmǎn*).
**Or** (*huò*), its wondrous origin being profound and tranquil (*miàoběn shēnjìng*), constantly as the root of all things (*cháng wéi wànwù zhī zōng*).
**Saying "or" as if it exists**—
The Dao has no fixed form (*dào fēi yǒu fǎ*), thus it cannot be spoken of directly (*gù bù zhèngyán ěr*).
All else follows this pattern (*tā jiē fǎng cǐ*).
**Tempering their sharpness, dispersing their entanglements.**
The Dao, through **purity** (*chōng*) and **harmony** (*hé*), can suppress the **advancing** (*jìn*) and **sharp** (*ruì*), release the **rooted conflicts** (*jiēgēn*).
If the **common scholars** (*súxué*) seek to restore, their entanglements only deepen (*ruò súxué qiú fù, zé mí jiégēn yě*).

**The Commentary says:**
**Temper** (*cuò*) means **suppress** (*yì zhǐ*).
**Sharp** (*ruì*) means **advancing** (*jìn*).
**Release** (*jiě*) means **dispel** (*shì sàn*).

The **purity and emptiness** of the Dao’s function knows no resistance—thus, the **advancing and sharp** hearts, the **entangled and chaotic** affairs, all naturally **suppress and disperse** when one contemplates the Dao’s **purity and harmony**.

This is how one **guides humanity** to understand the Dao’s function.

**The Commentary says:**
The **common scholars** seek to restore their original nature (*súxué qiú fù qí chū*), yet their **advancing sharpness** and **entangled chaos** arise from desire—thus, contemplating the Dao **suppresses and disperses** them, while **common learning** only **deepens the knots**.

**Harmonizing its light, blending with the dust.**
The Dao is nowhere absent, yet wherever it is, it is always **non-existent**.
In light, it is one with light; in dust, it is one with dust.
One with light and dust, yet neither light nor dust.
**Deep and vast**, as if something exists.

**Harmonizing its light and blending with the dust**, yet its **mystic origin** remains **unobstructed**—thus, it appears **deep and vast**, as if something persists.

**The Commentary says:**
The Dao’s **purity and emptiness** in its function is **unexhausted** in all things.
In light, it merges with light; in dust, it merges with dust.
Nowhere is it absent, yet wherever it is, it is always **non-existent**.
Through **purity and harmony**, it can **blend light and dust**, yet its **mystic origin** remains **deep and still, unmixed**.
Thus, it is said to appear as if something exists.

**I do not know whose child I am, yet I resemble the Emperor before creation.**

I do not know my origin—**the Dao is not born**, for it has no form.
The Dao seems to exist before the Emperor, for the Emperor is the **sovereign of all things**.
**Resemble** means **to appear as**.

**The Commentary says:**
**"I"** refers to Laozi’s self-designation.
**Resemble** means **to appear as**.
Laozi says: *"I see the Dao’s purity and emptiness, giving rise to all things together.
Seeking its source, I cannot fathom its origin.
Since the Dao has no father, who could know it as a child?
All things depend on the Dao for birth, thus it seems to exist before the Emperor."*

**The Commentary says:**
The Emperor is the **sovereign of all transformations**.
*The Book of Changes* says: *"The Emperor emerges from **Zhen (☳)**."*
**Zhen** is the **eastern hexagram**, the **minor yang qi**, the **source of transformation and birth**.
Now, the heir apparent resides in the **eastern palace**, in the **minor yang position**, ascending to the throne as the **period of Zhen’s emergence**—this symbolizes the **beginning of heaven and earth nurturing all things**.

**Manifesting as an image** is called **resemblance**—**the unseen is qi**, **manifesting form is image**, the **first of all things**.
The **first of all things**, resembling the Emperor, stands before him.
The **Great Dao’s purity and emptiness** is the **root of all things**.
The Dao is always **humble and unfilled**, **pure and harmonious**, **serene and still**, dwelling within—**deep, mysterious, and tranquil**, the **sovereign of all things**.
Thus, if things lose the Dao’s **purity and harmony**, they will **decay and perish**.
If a person loses the Dao’s **purity and harmony**, they will **die and be extinguished**.
If a ruler loses the Dao’s **purity and harmony**, governance will be **disordered and the people will scatter**.
If a subject loses the Dao’s **purity and harmony**, their **reputation will vanish and they will be humiliated**.

Thus, one knows that the Dao of **purity and harmony** is what all things **rely upon for stability**—it is the **root of all things**.
Speak of its **function in all things**, and it is **bright and vast**.
Seek its **mystic origin**, and it is **deep and ever-empty**.
The Dao cannot be **directly spoken of as existing**, yet all things have the Dao.
**Following this pattern**, one does not dare speak of it directly.

**Suppressing their sharpness, dispersing their entanglements.**
Governance through the Dao of **purity and harmony** means there is no **advancing sharpness** to harm things, no **chaotic affairs** to harm people.
If no harm comes to things, then **all nations will come to court**, the **four barbarians will turn to transformation**, **weapons will not rise**, and **grievances will not arise**.
They will not **pursue territorial expansion or conquest**, nor **oppress the weak or few**.

If no harm comes to people, then **they will be governed in due season**, **taxes and labor will be light**, and **families will be ample, people sufficient**.

For those who **govern themselves**, they **dispel entanglements and suppress sharpness**—
externally, there is no **competition or intrusion**,
internally, they **embrace clarity and emptiness**,
their **spirit is at ease, their body secure**,
and they **find tranquility in natural ease**.

**Guiding humanity to clarify the Dao’s function** is to show that **humanity must depend on the Dao**.

As *Zhuangzi’s* **"Xiu Xing" chapter** says: *"The common scholars seek to restore their original nature"*—
once humanity has become entangled in worldly affairs, yet they wish to **recover their primordial nature through worldly learning**, their pursuit only **further distorts the Way**.
**Common learning** only **deepens the knots**—
the **advancing sharpness** and **chaotic affairs**, if not **suppressed and dispersed by the Dao**, will only **bind tighter in worldly entanglement**, becoming **unbreakable**.

**Common scholars** are those who **pursue worldly knowledge**, not the **Way of daily diminishment**.

**Harmonizing its light until it is deep and vast, as if something exists.**
The Dao of **purity and harmony** pervades all beings,
**vast and unobstructed**, yet all things are within it—
this is **harmonizing light and blending with dust**.
**Light** is **clarity and purity**; **dust** is **chaos and confusion**.
The **virtuous person** does not **stand out rigidly**, but **aligns with the multitude**.
**Buon** means **lacking**.

Though the Dao pervades all beings, its **mystic origin** remains **congealed in stillness, pure and empty**, never **exhausted or absent**—
thus, it is said to **persist as if something exists**.

**I do not know whose child I am, yet I resemble the Emperor before creation.**
The Emperor is the **first of all transformations**, the **original sovereign**, whose **form and image first emerged**, whom **rulers shepherd**—
thus, it is said to **resemble the Emperor**.

The **Great Dao’s purity and emptiness** gives rise to all transformations—
thus, it exists **before the Emperor**.
The **Great Sage Laozi**—could he not know the **root of the Dao**?
He **feigns doubt and resemblance** to **awaken those lost in worldly affairs**.

As before, the **Great Dao cannot be directly spoken of**.

*The Book of Changes* says: *"The Emperor emerges from **Zhen (☳)**—all things are born.
**Uniform in Xun (☴)**, all things are purified.
**Encountered in Li (☲)**, the sage faces south, bringing enlightenment.
**Fulfills its role in Kun (☷)**, all things are nourished.
**Explains itself in Dui (☱)**, all things find joy."*

*(Note: Some characters were unclear in the original text; "□" placeholders indicate missing or ambiguous terms. "Xiu Xing" chapter title was partially reconstructed based on context.)*

「Striving in **Qian (☰)**, the clash of yin and yang.
**Exhausted in **Kan (☵)**, the place where all things return.**

**Completion in **Gen (☶)**, the beginning and end of all things.**

Now, all things emerge from **Zhen (☳)** and conclude in **Gen (☶)**.
Concluding yet perpetually renewing, following the Dao’s endless transformations—
and here lies the **Symbol of the Emperor**,
existing before **Zhen (☳)**’s emergence,
while the **Great Dao** precedes even the **Symbol of the Emperor**,
thus it reigns as sovereign of **generation and transformation**,
the primal origin of heaven and earth.

The **Human Sovereign** embodies the Dao with sincerity,
his resolve never overflowing,
deep and clear as a boundless well,
to govern all directions.
Outside, no sharp conflicts arise,
below, no chaotic disturbances occur—
harmonizing with heavenly radiance to illuminate all,
containing the dust of the world while maintaining dignity.
His **effortless transformation** may well align with the **Symbol of the Emperor**!

The **Sovereign of the Song Dao** said:
*"The Dao is vast, yet when applied, it seems never full.
The Dao has sentiment and trust, thus it has use.
Effortless, it is formless—thus it never overflows.
The **Scripture** states: All things bear yin and embrace yang,
the **vacuous qi** to achieve harmony.
If the Dao leans too much toward yang, it becomes forceful,
or oversteps its bounds.
If it leans too much toward yin, it grows weak,
or falls short.
Without excess or deficiency, this is the **vacuous qi**.
Vacuous means central—
this is the **Great Harmony**.
The high are humbled, the low are elevated,
the excessive is tempered, the lacking is supplemented—
the Dao’s application finds no end yet always attains its center.
Pour from it, yet it never overflows;
draw from it, yet it never exhausts.
The more one gives to others, the more one possesses oneself;
the more one shares with others, the more one gains.
The Dao’s essence is like the **Great Void**,
encompassing the six directions—
how could it ever overflow?
Deep as the primal source of all things.

**Zhuangzi** said:
*"The **frog’s** stillness is a well,
standing water’s stillness is a well,
flowing water’s stillness is a well.
Deep and tranquil, it does not mix with things—
this is the Dao’s essence.
Only the void gathers all reality,
only the stillness governs all motion—
this is the root of all things,
the foundation of the **One Transformation**.
Thus it is called the **primal source of all things**.
Yet the Dao itself has no root—
things naturally depend upon it,
so it only *seems* to be their source."*

**Blunting its sharpness** to **unify with the dust**—
the keen, the injurious;
the chaotic, the divisive.
**Blunting the sharp** prevents conflict,
**dissolving the chaotic** avoids disorder.
**Harmonizing its light**—as **Zhuangzi** said:
*"Shining yet not dazzling!"*
**Unifying with the dust**—as **Zhuangzi** said:
*"Without things clinging and swaying, yet aligned with its waves."*

If one’s sincerity is unbroken,
yet his scheming forms a blinding light—
how could this be **harmonizing its light**?
If one polishes his wisdom to startle the foolish,
and refines his conduct to expose the filthy—
his brilliance like revealing the sun and moon—
how could this be **unifying with the dust**?

The **Sage blunts the sharp**—thus in his dealings, he neither harms nor is harmed.
**Dissolving the chaotic**, he neither plots with cleverness nor clings to schemes.
All things cannot perturb his mind—
thus he bears no **overbearing expression**,
no **arrogant qi**—
harmonious yet unyielding,
in perfect accord with all things,
to fulfill the will of the world,
finding no entrance where he does not find contentment.

**Tranquil as if in latent existence**—
the heart like cold ashes,
the body like withered wood’s branches,
within **serene composure**, the heavenly light shines by itself.
Awakened yet as if lost and preserved,
naturally formless yet divine—
this is its Dao, is it not?

I do not know whose child it is—
it exists before the **Symbol of the Emperor**.
**Symbol**—the first visible form of things.
**Emperor**—the divine response to things.
Things are born, then **Symbol** appears;
the **Emperor** emerges, then wonders manifest.
The **Symbol of the Emperor** is the origin of all things,
yet the **Great Dao** precedes it.
As **Zhuangzi** said:
*"The divine and the ghostly,
the divine and the Emperor,
generate heaven and earth."*

Invisible to the gaze,
inaudible to the ear,
untouchable to the hand—
it emerges yet no one sees its gate.
Who could know it?
Thus I say:
*"I do not know whose child it is—
it exists before the **Symbol of the Emperor**."*

**Wang Anshi** said:
*"The Dao is vast, yet when applied, it seems never full.
The Dao has **essence** and **function**.
**Essence**—the **primal qi**’s immobility.
**Function**—the **vacuous qi** flowing between heaven and earth,
its **vacuous qi** utterly void yet singular,
in heaven as the **Five Celestial Phases**,
on earth as the **Six Terrestrial Phases**.
Indeed, the **vacuous qi** is the **Great Void**—
the origin of all things,
reaching ultimate emptiness yet singularity,
thus it seems never full.
*The **Explanation of Characters** says:
The **vacuous qi** takes **Heaven One** as its master,
so it is written with **water (氵)**;
the center of heaven and earth,
so it is written with **middle (中)**.
Again, water is level and central,
unfilled yet balanced—
this is **vacuous qi**."*

**Tranquil as if in latent existence**—
**Tranquil** means deep.
The Dao’s nature is profound yet capable of all things,
not responding to things yet things naturally rely upon it for birth,
and it also fulfills all things’ demands—
thus it is called the **primal source of all things**.
*"Seems"*—for I dare not name it directly.

**Blunting its sharpness** to **unify with the dust**—
**Sharpness** is the form of **fire (☵)**;
**Chaotic** is the form of **silk (纟)**.
**Blunting the sharp**—perfecting the round.
**Dissolving the chaotic**—attaining still unity.
**Harmonizing its light**—not blazing above.
**Unifying with the dust**—not obscured below.

**Tranquil as if in latent existence**—
the Dao’s stillness is deep,
though unseen in its advance,
yet it seems as if in latent existence.

I do not know whose child it is—
it exists before the **Symbol of the Emperor**.

I do not know who gave birth to it—
it precedes the **Symbol of the Emperor**.
**Symbol**—the first appearance of form.
**Emperor**—the progenitor of all things.
Thus *The **Systematic Commentary** says:
*"Seeing, we call it **Symbol**—
the **Emperor** emerges from **Zhen (☳)**,
its Dao existing before heaven and earth."*

**Su Yingbin** said:
*"The Dao is vast, yet when applied, it reaches the **primal source of all things**.
Indeed, the Dao is vast yet utterly without form.
Yet with it, all things are fulfilled—
though heaven and earth are vast,
mountains and rivers are broad,
it traverses all without end.
Because it is formless,
it seems never full."*

「Its depths are boundless and profound—
I know it as the primal source of all things.
Yet I dare not speak of it directly,
so I say it seems like the primal source of all things.

To blunt its sharpness, it attains to **Zhen (湛)**—
like something latent yet existing.
No one lacks the Dao,
but the Sage can preserve it whole.

To blunt its sharpness, lest it stray into **madness (妄)**.
To resolve its confusion, lest it clash with things.
If it does not stray into madness,
nor clash with things,
then external calamities are gone,
and its radiance arises.

Yet to follow and harmonize it,
lest it differ from things.
Radiance—pure and bright.
Dust—utterly mixed.
Though dust may seem the same,
I fear it would abandon all things.
Only thus can preservation be complete—
**Zhen (湛)** then remains in its constant state.

Though it exists, yet no one perceives it,
so I say it seems like something latent yet existing.
I do not know whose child it is—
it precedes the **Symbol of the Emperor**.

Though the Dao constantly exists,
no one can ultimately name it,
yet it cannot be said to be nonexistent.
Hence I say: "Is this not before the **Emperor**?"
The **Emperor** precedes all,
yet it precedes even the **Emperor**—
then nothing can precede it.

**Lu Jiufu** said:
*"The Dao is vast, yet when applied, it seems never full.
The Dao is born from **vacuity (冲)**,
and its use is all there is.
**Vacuity (冲)** brings harmony and unity,
so it is said: 'The Dao is vast, yet when applied, it seems never full.'
'Seems'—these are words of doubt, not absolute denial.
Because of its **vacuity (冲)** and emptiness,
it can yet nourish all things,
so it is said to be 'never full.'

**Yuan (渊)**—like the primal source of all things.
Thus, **empty the heart, weaken the will**,
and keep the people ever without knowing or desiring.
Only in this way
does **Yuan (渊)** seem like the primal source of all things,
yet those who seek it as such
will surely not find it—
it is only like that.

To blunt its sharpness, until it aligns with dust.
Then how can one safeguard the Dao?
To blunt its sharpness,
to resolve its confusion,
to harmonize its radiance,
to align with dust—
that is all.

When the heart emerges and enters things, it is sharpness;
to blunt its sharpness, yet not to act.
When things approach and mingle with the heart, it is confusion;
to resolve its confusion, yet not to be disturbed.
Sharpness blunted, confusion resolved,
then the **constant clarity (知常)** shines forth like the light of heaven.
Radiance—outside of dust,
in radiance, no obscuring,
so it is harmonized without distinction.
Dust—within the radiance,
in dust, no dimming,
so it is aligned without difference.
**Zhen (湛)**—like something latent yet existing.

Only thus
does the so-called primal source
become **Zhen (湛)**, like something latent yet existing.
**Yuan (渊)**—speaking of its depth.
**Zhen (湛)**—speaking of its purity.
'Seems never full'—this is not to fix it as **vacuity (虚)**.
'Seems like something latent yet existing'—
this is not to fix it as **constant existence (存)**.

I do not know whose child it is—
it precedes the **Symbol of the Emperor**.
Presence, absence, existence, nonexistence—
I have no fixed place for my thoughts,
so how could I know its origin?
Seeing its birth,
it is only the **Heavenly Spirit (天神)**, the **Emperor (帝)**—
so I say: "I do not know whose child it is,
it precedes the **Symbol of the Emperor**."

If there is one who knows,
then the Dao is hidden.
If I do not know,
then I am also not known.
This is the true source of the Dao.

To give birth to heaven before all,
to manifest the **Symbol of the Emperor** as the **Emperor**’s beginning—
then its precedence over all forms is clear.

**Lu Nongshi** said:
*"The Dao is vast, yet when applied, it seems never full.
The Dao is used in **vacuity (冲)**,
so though it pervades the **Dharma Realm (法界)**,
it is never seen as full.
**Yuan (渊)**—like the primal source of all things.
Deep beyond measure,
yet as the **宗师 (宗师)** of all things.
The words 'seems'—
I dare not speak directly,
as **Liezi**’s **独疑 (Doubt of the One)**,
and **Zhuangzi**’s **始疑 (Doubt of the Beginning)**.

To blunt its sharpness, until it aligns with dust.
Not competing with things—
so it is said: 'To blunt its sharpness.'
Not binding to **dharma (法)**—
so it is said: 'To resolve its confusion.'
Not revealing its obscurity—
so it is said: 'To harmonize its radiance.'
Not evading nor departing—
so it is said: 'To align with dust.'

**Zhen (湛)**—like something latent yet existing.
It seems to exist yet is not truly existing,
it seems nonexistent yet is not truly nonexistent—
its source is unknown,
yet it precedes the **Symbol of the Emperor**,
so I say: **Zhen (湛)**, like something latent yet existing.

I do not know whose child it is—
it precedes the **Symbol of the Emperor**.
**Zhen (湛)** is the vessel of **Yuan (渊)**,
form is called **body (体)**,
perception is called **manifestation (容)**—
so I begin with **Yuan (渊)**,
and end with **Zhen (湛)**.

I do not know whose child it is—
it precedes the **Symbol of the Emperor**.
Ultimately, it cannot be named,
so I say: "I do not know whose child it is,
it precedes the **Symbol of the Emperor**."

The **Emperor**—the sovereign of all things.

**Wang Yuanzé** said:
*"The Dao is vast, yet when applied, it seems never full.
The Dao fills all without boundary,
nourishing all things,
yet never truly has—
so it is said to be 'never full.'

Whether **vacuity (虚)** or **reality (实)**,
it is called **vacuity (冲)**.
**Vacuity (冲)**—the balance of **yin and yang (阴阳)**,
and its **virtue/power (德)** is **emptiness (虚)**.
When the Dao is applied to things,
the **middle Dao (中道)** responds to affairs—
in **vacuity (虚)**, its use is spoken of,
so it is called **vacuity (冲)**.

*The **Zasay (杂说)** states:
*'All things bear **yin (阴)** and embrace **yang (阳)**,
**vacuity (冲)** unites them in harmony,
so **vacuity (冲)** is the harmony of **yin and yang (阴阳)**.*
**Yin (阴)** is **vacuity (虚)**,
**yang (阳)** is **fullness (盈)**,
the nature of the Dao is **vacuity (冲)**,
yet its application is 'never full'—
its nature is **vacuity (冲)**.

Hence, whether desiring or not desiring,
it is called **Xuan (玄)**,
yet its application is 'never full.'
**Yuan (渊)**—like the primal source of all things.
The Dao gives birth to all things,
yet its nature never truly departs from things—
from the perspective of things’ scattered differences,
it seems like their primal source.
**Yuan (渊)**—deep beyond measure.
People are originally sufficient in this Dao,
but those who seek its essence
cannot find it elsewhere.
They must blunt sharpness, resolve confusion,
harmonize radiance, align with dust—
then it will naturally preserve itself.

*The **Zasay (杂说)** states:
*'Because of its **Yuan (渊)** depth,
it constantly arises from things,
so it is said to be like the primal source of all things.'*

To blunt its sharpness, until it aligns with dust.
To blunt its sharpness—
when sharpness is blunted, it becomes **whole (浑)**.
Sharpness—
the form of **fire (火)** is what it is.»

To resolve its confusion,
one does not contend with things,
but sits and observes their return—
then nature and life settle,
and confusion dissolves.

To harmonize its radiance,
when sharpness is blunted and confusion resolved,
nature and disposition settle,
and naturally, fullness and luminosity arise.

Once luminous, it must not differ from things,
but align and harmonize with them.
*The Classic of Changes* says:
*"Meng [蒙] is mixed yet settled."*

To align with dust—
the Dao is the constant of nature.
Why should it be prized?

Thus, the Perfect One embodies the Dao
yet does not differ from dust.
*The Zasay* says:
*"When sharp, blunt it;
when confused, resolve it;
when radiant, harmonize it;
when dusty, align with it—
neither having nor lacking.
Deep, yet seemingly present."*

If one follows these four practices,
the Dao will be deep and seemingly present.

If it is truly present and fixed,
then it is not the Dao.
"Seemingly present"—
this is what cannot be fixed as having.

I do not know whose child it is,
prior to the august Emperor.

It is the essence within the Dao itself.
Truly, it has a source,
yet boundless without form—
thus, *"I do not know whose child it is."*

*Symbol* is the mark of form;
*Emperor* is the sovereign of things.
Though the Symbol of the Emperor is attained,
the Dao precedes it still.

Liu Zhongping says:
*"The Dao is boundless in its use, yet its application may not be full."*

What is meant by *boundless*?
Neither high nor low,
neither deep nor shallow,
neither left nor right,
neither before nor after,
neither far nor near,
neither outside nor inside—
boundless, and nothing more.

Boundless—
this is the essence of the Dao.
Its response to things
always arises from emptiness.
Emptiness means it cannot be filled—
this is the Dao’s function.

Thus, *"The Dao is boundless in its use, yet its application may not be full."*

Deep, yet seemingly the primal source of all things.
Because its essence is boundless,
it is nowhere absent,
and all things revere it before they exist.
Thus, *"Deep, yet seemingly the primal source of all things."*

To blunt its sharpness until deep—
seemingly present.
Because its application may not be full,
it does nothing without effect—
when sharp, blunt it;
when confused, resolve it;
when radiant, harmonize it;
when dusty, align with it.
And it seems to be present among all things,
thus, *"To blunt its sharpness until deep—
seemingly present."*

I do not know whose child it is,
prior to the august Emperor.
Its essence precedes having and lacking.
Having and lacking—
this is what is called *Symbol*.
Its prior state is beyond having and lacking.
Its function precedes being,
and being is what is called *Emperor*.
Its prior state is beyond non-action.
Thus, *"I do not know whose child it is,
prior to the august Emperor."*

Though it is beyond having and lacking,
once it is obtained as a child,
it gives rise to lacking—
this is its father.
The father who gives rise to lacking,
then the one who gives rise to the father of lacking—
this is the ancestor.
From this point onward,
it cannot be traced further.

In its function, non-action—
once called a child,
it makes things act—
this is its father.
The father who makes things act,
then the one who makes the father act—
this is the ancestor.
From this point onward,
it cannot be traced further.

Liu Jujie says:
*"The Dao is boundless in its use, yet its application may not be full.*
*The Dao*—its function is boundless *qi*,
empty yet harmonious.
Harmony allows it to respond to things and give birth,
thus, *"its application may not be full."*

*"Seemingly"*—
this is not speaking directly of its existence.

Deep, yet seemingly the primal source of all things.
*Deep*—this is *Dao*.
The Dao’s essence is empty,
thus able to respond, receive, and deepen.
All things’ generation and transformation
arise from the Dao—
not sudden, yet unfathomable.
In its function, it is spoken of as *"seemingly"*—
in its essence, as *"seemingly the primal source."*

To blunt its sharpness until aligning with dust.
*Sharpness*—this is the Dao’s acuity.
*Confusion*—this is the multiplicity of affairs.
Affairs are confused,
yet not the Dao that resolves them—
how could scattered affairs prevail?
Yet without blunting sharpness,
confusion could not be resolved.
For excessive sharpness means some things cannot enter—
like today’s unraveling knots with a dull awl.

*Radiance*—this is the Dao’s clarity.
*Dust*—this is the vulgar’s obscurity.
The vulgar are obscured,
yet not the Dao that aligns with them—
if it makes itself clear,
then differing from the vulgar would be exalted—
what reliance on the Dao would remain?
Yet without harmonizing radiance,
one could not align with dust.
For excessive clarity means it cannot contain dust.

As Zhuangzi said:
*"When crossing streams with others,
my intention is the same."*

Deep, yet seemingly present.
Empty, thus deep;
deep, thus still;
still, thus unified.
Essence and function are present within it.
*Deep*—this is the form of stillness.
The world’s chaos from excessive affairs
has no end.
Only the Dao can resolve and align,
saving the world from its murky depths—
thus, it may be said to be everywhere,
yet truly not departing.

*"Seemingly"*—
this encompasses the two phrases above.

I do not know whose child it is,
prior to the august Emperor.
The Dao arises from non-being,
thus the Dao is the child of non-being.
Yet it is said *"I do not know"*—
the Dao’s limit,
even Laozi dared not speak directly of its existence.

*Symbol*—the mark of form.
*Emperor*—the master of generation.
Though the mother of all things
does not embody its generation,
yet it embodies the *Symbol of the Emperor*—
the Dao arises from non-being,
and the *Symbol of the Emperor* arises from the Dao.

Non-being is like a father,
the Dao is like a child,
the *Symbol of the Emperor* is like a grandson.
Zhuangzi said: *"Prior to the Great Ultimate."*

The previous chapter speaks of governance,
thus it follows with the Dao’s boundlessness.

Liu Ji says:
*"The Dao is boundless in its use, yet its application may not be full,
until prior to the august Emperor.*
The Dao is nowhere absent,
yet nowhere absent in its doing.
Boundless in its use,
its function is inexhaustible.
Though filling heaven and earth,
pervading the six voids,
it is not seen as full.
Clothing all things without being their master,
all things return to it, yet it does not know itself as master."*

Thus, it is the **Root of all things**—
yet none in the world can know it,
none can see it.

Deep and mysterious—
it is only like this.

*"Deep"* means:
subtle, wondrous, and fundamentally unified,
profound beyond recognition.

Then, those who **enter this Dao** by sitting still,
how should they proceed?
Only by **dulling the sharp** and **unraveling the tangled**.

**Dulling the sharp** means:
dulling its piercing edge,
and with gentle weakness processing oneself—
this is knowing *Yang* yet holding *Yin*,
knowing *white* yet holding *black*.

**Unraveling the tangled** means:
unraveling its chaos,
and with emptiness and tranquility dwelling within—
this is removing filth and halting thought,
calming the mind and guarding the One.

Thus, within **Great Tranquility**,
the heavenly light shines naturally,
its luminosity tempered so it does not dazzle itself,
its dust harmonized so it does not differ from others.
Refining the **Void’s essence**,
achieving **Nature’s True Self**,
serene yet ever still,
as if both absent and present—
thus, *"serene"* is like something both present and absent,
seen yet its form is invisible,
heard yet its sound is unheard.
No beginning can be grasped,
no end can be traced,
no name can be given to it.

Thus, I do not know whose child it is,
prior to the *Symbol of the Emperor*.

The *Symbol* is the **beginning of form**,
the *Emperor* is the **ancestor of life**—
thus, it is used as metaphor,
for its arising before heaven and earth yet encompassing them.

Thus, it follows with heaven and earth.

Zhao Shizhen says:
*"At first, I doubted only two.
One: using harmony as application—
the Dao is boundless yet applied without action,
thus nothing is left ungoverned.
And following with boundless Dao applied—
the Dao is not without doing,
but rather completes action.
Though it has action yet shows the function of non-action,
this is the Dao’s application.
All affairs under heaven value **equanimity and harmony**—
if one can apply the Dao’s balance,
then above, it does not reach **excess**,
below, it does not sink to **extreme lowliness**,
this is the Dao of the Emperor’s **Great Balance**.
Thus, governance is shown through action,
and governance reaching balance and harmony is called **Great Peace**.
Does **Great Peace** still have the *Symbol*?
It returns to **non-action**.
Yet this chapter first speaks of application,
then of subtlety—
subtlety is not dared to be directly shown.
Thus, the text speaks of *one* or *two* as if,
*as if* being the words of doubt;
*seemingly* being the words of approximation.
The Dao is originally formless,
truly without fixed essence.
Now, if it is applied through balance,
then the Dao is also shaped by rules and methods.
If the Dao follows rules and methods,
then it is fixed and unchanging.
Once fixed, it cannot universally respond—
how then can it be subtle?
The Dao moves with **spiritual dynamism**,
and heaven follows—
thus, it is only *as if* like this.

The **Commentary** says:
*"Boundless"* is **balance**.
**Balance** is the *qi* of **harmony and moderation**.
Its root is from **One to Two**,
from **Two to Three**—
**One** is heaven,
**Two** is earth,
**Three** is humanity.
The *qi* divides from **One** into **Three**,
clear ascending as *Yang*,
dark descending as earth—
*Yin* and *Yang* interact,
and the **central *qi*** is born.

The text does not say **balance** but **boundless**—why?
Heaven is **One** below,
one being the celestial number—
**One** arises from *Kǎn* (the abyss),
*Kǎn* being water,
the *fontanelle* at the crown,
*fontanelle* being surrounded by five—
five being earth.
Within the five *qi*, water and earth are both contained,
within the *fontanelle*, the *cinnabar field* belongs.
Indeed, five times five is ten,
ten being the **mother of things**,
one being five.
Within its essence, there is **faith**,
thus it is contained in the **primordial head**.
Heaven five is **balance**,
yet from water, it has the principle of harmony.
Thus, **boundless** is **balance**,
this is called **Great Harmony**.
The text says: *"Within it, there is **essence** (精), **essence** being **One**,
and within it, there is **faith** (信), **faith** being **Five**."*

Now, speaking of **applying balance**—
the Dao uses *qi* as its application,
*qi* in things being **faith**.
*Qi* is what envelops the **six extremes**.
Today, heaven and earth, both inside and out,
are all encompassed by **One *qi***.
Once inside and out are encompassed,
it is full.
Fullness cannot endure,
thus the **ordained commands** exist.
They regulate heaven and earth’s transformations,
so that nothing is excessive—
if excessive, then **boundless** is used as application.
Thus, it can be understood.

**Balance** is the **great root of the world**,
**harmony** is the **universal Dao**.
Two: its Dao guards **balance**.

Sometimes it seems not full—
this is because the Dao has no fixed essence,
using essence as essence,
it cannot be named directly.
Fullness cannot last long.
Using **nine** is to know **change**.
If it is already balanced without fault,
then in *Kǎn* (the abyss),
it may still seem not full.
Sometimes it seems not full—
its presence, who can exhaust?
Its depth, who can fathom?
Heaven is **One’s nature**—
its fruit lies in **balance**?
Heaven five is **One’s fate**—
its fruit lies far from **One**?
Thus, *"deep"* is like the **Root of all things**.

Approximate speculation—
it cannot even be correctly met.
Three: **not mastering**, thus constant.

*"Deep"* is like the **Root of all things**.
The **Void** is the Dao’s essence,
**obscurity** is the Dao’s hue,
**depth** is the Dao’s origin,
**flickering** is the Dao’s application.

Without essence yet essence—
vast and minute, all are its essence.
Without hue yet hue—
dark and bright, all are its hue.
Hidden in **depth and void**,
yet its application is inexhaustible—
thus it is said, *"deep is its dwelling"*.

Who then holds the **true position**?
All take the **Void** as essence,
the **Void** as hue—
and yet, who can exhaust its source?
Who can measure its mystery?
All is only *as if*—
thus it is said, *"the Dao cannot be named directly"*.

Following, **correctly expounding** the **subtle application**.

One: **diminishing stillness, obscuring response**.
Dulling its sharpness,
unraveling its chaos,
harmonizing its light,
equalizing its dust—
these four are all **human affairs**,
yet human affairs do not depart from the Dao.
Using the Dao in balance to respond to them.

The **Commentary** says:
*"To harmonize all under heaven’s intentions,
so that none enter without finding their own fulfillment."*

Now, these four:
respond externally yet apply internally,
all are matters of **nature’s division**.

Dulling its sharpness—
**One *qi*** generates humanity,
filling the four limbs abundantly,
*qi* within us—
none are not fully filled.

If one does not nourish it with evenness,
harmonize it with nature,
then strife will arise at times—
when it arises, it overflows outward as **excessive rigidity**,
and excessive rigidity harms things.
Those who understand this
will, when encountering rigidity, naturally restrain themselves.

Thus it is said, *"Dull its sharpness"*—
**dulling one’s own sharpness**.

**Unraveling its chaos**—
All things fill the space between heaven and earth,
none without affairs.
When myriad affairs press upon me,
I must know them,
and contain them within **Oneness**,
then they will quiet and cease.
If I follow them with movement,
they will harmonize and flow.
To quiet and cease them brings clarity,
but to follow and drift drowns one.
Thus, **unraveling chaos** means
**containing them within Oneness to still them**.

**Harmonizing its light**—
Light is the scattering of clarity.
If inner sincerity does not falter,
form and strategy manifest as light.
Light within me,
like carrying the sun and moon while walking,
seeking to overcome others’ light with my own—
how could one know that others’ light also illuminates my light?
Better to forget oneself in Dao/Way’s art—
what difference is there between you and me?

**Equalizing its dust**—
Human life has never lacked distinctions of high and low.
If distinctions exist, nearly all will argue.
If one does not cling to them,
nearly all will align.
Thus, **unequal** is the division of high and low,
while **equalizing** is the matter of virtue/nature.
In essence, what the **Noble One** aligns in is only nature’s division.

As the saying goes:
*"The Noble One harmonizes yet does not align,
the petty aligns yet does not harmonize."*

**Two: Embracing emptiness to respond.**
**Deep and vast, as if it exists.**

When things overflow,
in affairs, it is excess.
When water overflows,
in vessels, it spills.
Neither excess nor spilling—
only **deep and vast**, and that is all.
**Deep** is clarity.
Illustrating the **Dao’s essence**.

The Dao is not an affair,
nor is it water.
To call it clarity is not clarity,
to call it obscure is not obscure.
When it is sensed, it communicates—
**as if it exists**, yet only seems so.

**Later clarity, without beginning.**
**One: Manifesting without a master.**
I do not know whose child it is,
emerging from the **Great Emptiness**.
The **Great Emptiness** has no name—
whose father could it be?

**Two: Independent and profound darkness.**
**Embodying the Sovereign before all.**
This chapter first speaks of application,
then of subtlety—
thus, subtlety is revealed through application.
When subtlety is revealed,
it lies in *"I do not know whose child it is,"*
**embodying the Sovereign before all.**

The **Commentary** says:
*"Embodiment is the first appearance of things,
the Sovereign is the divine response to things.
With embodiment and things—
could this be the Dao?
The preceding text merely initially speaks of application,
then of calming the heart,
until ‘not overflowing or seeming to exist,’
all correctly expounding the Dao’s great essence."*

**Not overflowing** is not reaching the limit of numbers to overflow.
**As if the root of all things**, yet not assuming responsibility for affairs.
**Deep and vast, as if it exists**—
being and non-being cannot exhaust it.
Then, embodying the Sovereign cannot precede it,
whose child it is cannot be known.

**Shao Ruo Yu** says:
*"The Dao is boundless in its application,
as if it does not overflow until it embodies the Sovereign before all."*

The **Great Dao** with boundless *qi* transforms into **One Qi**.
**One Qi** divides into yin and yang.
Yin and yang generate transformation,
receiving **One Qi** as their master—
thus knowing that **One Qi** dwells within yin and yang,
hence it is called **boundless qi**.

The **Great Dao** applies boundless *qi*—
like heaven covering, earth bearing,
the sun shining, the moon attending,
winter’s cold, summer’s heat,
spring’s birth, autumn’s gathering—
all are the application of boundless *qi*.
Boundless *qi* is **present yet formless,
absent yet precise**,
between heaven and earth—
neither overflowing nor deficient.

**Deep and vast, as if the root of all things**—
Those who study seek boundless *qi*:
they must dull their heart’s sharpness.
When sharpness ceases, the will rests,
thus able to unravel affairs’ chaos.
With a tranquil will and few desires,
one harmonizes light;
without contending with things,
one equalizes dust.
With neither inner nor outer defilement,
**deep and vast**—
only a **single heart** remains.
Though its traces are unseen,
**as if it exists**.

The **Buddhist School** likens it to a bright lamp and moon,
**alchemists** call it the **Great Elixir, Golden Pill**,
**Mencius** called it **浩然之气**—
speaking of the utmost greatness and rigidity,
nurtured upright without harm,
filling heaven and earth—
this *qi* aligns with virtue and the Dao.

**Laozi** points to *"deep and vast, as if it exists"*—
this is the **One Qi** transformed by the **Great Dao**.
*"I do not know whose child it is"*—
this embodies the **Sovereign of all things** before yin and yang.

**Wang Zhi Ran** says:
*"The Dao is boundless in its application,
as if it does not overflow until it embodies the Sovereign before all."*

Heaven and earth are vast,
all things are numerous—
the **One Qi** of all under heaven,
where is it not the Dao?
Humans dwell within their domain,
receiving the proper yin and yang,
boundless, harmonious, yielding, and compliant—
this is **humanity’s middle**,
born with heaven and earth,
sharing substance with all things.
If one applies it with balance,
it is called **the Middle Dao**;
if one attains its constancy,
it is called **the Constant Dao**.

**Boundless** is **middle**—
neither excess nor deficiency,
always within the appropriate measure,
boundless, expansive, and limitless,
pouring in yet never full,
drawing yet never exhausted,
upright in the divisions of **ren** and **yi**,
penetrating the essence of nature and life.

The ignorant do not know,
thus **Laozi** repeatedly emphasizes this,
while scholars often fear losing their way.

**Nurturing nature correctly**—
when still, it shares virtue with yin;
when moving, it shares waves with yang.
Sometimes dispersing, sometimes differing,
sometimes gathering, sometimes ceasing—
even in speech and silence,
affairs must have a master,
words must have a root.
**Root** is the root of this,
**application** is the application of this.

Moreover, the Dao generates all things,
yet the Dao never departs from things,
things never depart from the Dao.
Like rivers differing yet all returning to the sea,
or myriad teachings differing yet all returning to the Dao.

The Dao as a thing—
only **dim and indistinct**,
constantly dwelling between being and non-being,
cannot be pointed to in definite terms,
thus it is said: *"Deep and vast, as if the root of all things."*

「Some say it is deep yet seems as if it might exist,
its use is like the unfilled—this is the nature of it.

To blunt its sharpness, to untangle its confusion,
Zhuangzi said: *"The sage dwells among things without harming them,
and things cannot harm the sage.*
The sharp—if it has this, it need not be blunted,
for what sharpness remains?
The sage empties himself to wander in the world,
serene yet boundless,
all beauties follow him,
yet he does not engage with things,
dissolving like ice melting away.
The confused—if it has this, it need not be untangled,
for what confusion remains?"
Ah! The scholars of old and those of today
have differing words.

The ancient **Perfect Ones** (*zhìrén*) do not pursue profit,
do not abandon harm,
do not boast of prominence,
do not lament obscurity,
do not hoard judgments of right/wrong or good/evil.
Internally upright, they follow Heaven’s **Dao** (*Tian’s Way*),
externally adaptable, they follow humanity’s **Dao**.
Filled yet luminous, they shine without dazzling,
never uttering abrupt or extravagant claims.
The so-called "shining" is not without harmony,
the so-called "dusty" is not without unity—
how could they strive to force harmony and uniformity?
Just as Liezi dwelled in Zheng for forty years,
and no one recognized him,
the king and ministers, nobles and officials,
regarded him no differently than the common folk.
Laozi spoke of neighboring lands where
the sounds of roosters and dogs could be heard,
yet the people lived and died without ever visiting one another.
This may truly be called dwelling in ease and following the natural order,
finding their proper place.

Now, there are things that blend into unity,
born before Heaven and Earth,
silent and vast,
self-sufficient and unchanging.
Laozi said of himself: *"I do not know whose child I am,
I am before the **Archetypal Sovereign** (*Xiàngdì*)."*
The formless form, the symbol without substance—
this is the **Archetypal Sovereign** (*Shén Dì*) as the first emperor,
the **Dao** before any beginning.
*"I do not know myself"*—then who can I say I am?
This is not the **Dao**’s own origin,
yet how could it be otherwise?
Scholars should know what comes first and what follows,
striving earnestly to seek it out.

Huang Maocai said: *"The **Dao** is boundless, and its application reaches before the **Archetypal Sovereign**.
Yin and yang together are called **Dao**.
Boundless is the harmony of yin and yang’s **qi**.
Its use is like the unfilled—
empty, yet able to respond.
Deep, like the root of all things,
stillness can encompass all existence.
To blunt its sharpness—
not to compete with things.
To untangle its confusion—
each has its own order, yet nothing is disordered.
To harmonize its light—
to conceal it within oneself.
To blend with the dust—
to merge with the common.
Deep yet seems as if it might exist—
constantly existing yet never destroyed.
‘I do not know whose child I am, before the **Archetypal Sovereign**’—
this is the **Dao**.
The **Dao** originally has no name,
some call it the **Transforming Artificer** (*Huàgōng*),
some call it the **Creator** (*Zàowù*),
some call it before the **Archetypal Sovereign**—
all are forced names."*

Cheng Tai said: *"The **Dao** is boundless, and its application reaches to the root of all things.
Boundless is the opposite of full—
humble yet boundless, youthful yet boundless, vast yet boundless,
**harmonizing qi** is boundless—
all mean not to be extreme in fullness.
Zhuangzi likened the **Dao** to filling Heaven and Earth.
If it is both filling and full,
then its fullness is manifest.
Fullness is the **Dao**’s presence in all things.
Since fullness is honored,
yet boundless is also honored,
the more one uses the **Dao**,
the more one should be thus.
Like saying ‘knowing the male while guarding the female,
knowing the white while dwelling in the black’—
this is having both the male and female
yet resting in the female,
having both the white and black
yet dwelling in the black.
This is to be boundless in fullness,
seeking emptiness in the midst of it.
Thus it is called **boundless application** (*chōngyòng*).

Zhuangzi said: *"Carve and polish to return to simplicity,
do not be a **nominal sage** (*míngshī*)—
a name without substance,
do not be a **scheming strategist** (*móufǔ*)—
a mind without purpose,
do not be a **taskmaster** (*shìrèn*)—
a role without responsibility,
do not be a **master of knowledge** (*zhīzhǔ*)—
a scholar without true understanding.
To exhaust what Heaven bestows
yet show no trace of gain—
this is also emptiness.
Heaven’s single nature can fully possess all things,
yet it seems as if it has never gained anything—
this is to be boundless in fullness,
seeking to reach emptiness.
Thus, the **scheming strategist**,
the **taskmaster**,
the **master of knowledge**—
those who tread in its traces yet are truly substantial,
are indeed those who
have no inability yet never willingly probe to the end.
Is this not blaming fullness
and seeking emptiness instead?
All things under Heaven are born from existence,
existence from non-existence—
thus non-existence is the root of all things.
Once one has applied the **Dao**,
it emerges as **virtue** (*dé*),
and **virtue** divides into
**ren** (*仁*), **yi** (*义*), and **li** (*礼*).
How then can one rightly call it non-existence?
If one cannot contain non-existence,
then one should seek its nearest likeness—
only boundless can approach it.
‘The unfilled’—
this is not truly lacking,
merely doubt.
‘Seems as if it might exist’—
this is not daring to assert a definite claim.
The unfilled—
it is not yet able to swiftly reach non-existence,
thus it only seems like it.
This is all speaking of the **Dao**’s presence in humanity,
matching it to the **Dao** itself.

To blunt its sharpness, to untangle its confusion.
Sharpness—
the outward form of talent and wisdom,
with thorns and angles.
Confusion—
the details of affairs,
entangled and complex.
This is what Zhuangzi called the **sticky and agitated** (*jiāojiāo rǎorǎo*).
To blunt its sharpness—
to be thick and solid without exposure,
to untangle its confusion—
to be simple yet not disjointed.
To harmonize its light—
good faith fills one’s substance,
reaching luminosity.
The universe is stable and settled—
emanating from Heaven’s light,
its depth and brilliance vary,
yet its radiance is unified within and without.
If one embodies the **Dao**’s fullness
and manifests it in practice,
then its light is clear as the sun and moon—
people will not be able to approach it at all.
Shining yet not dazzling—
this is to seek unity with things.
Zhuangzi expounded the **Original Abode** (*Xuánshě*), rising from his seat,
and spoke of the light arising from form—
was this not also about harmonizing light and setting restraints?
To blend with the dust.»

「The dust is neither earth nor mere vapor,
but when aligned with worldly affairs,
its drifting and polluting nature is revealed.
If one can harmonize with it,
then even whiteness may enter *nirvana*,
while those who expose their nakedness,
unable to be cleansed,
are beyond reach.

Yet if one adorns wisdom to dazzle the foolish
or refines the body to reveal impurity,
it is contrary to this principle.

Deep and tranquil, as if something exists—
when sharpness is blunted and confusion untangled,
its response to things is natural, yet its function unseen.
When light blends with dust,
it mingles with the vulgar, unable to distinguish itself.
At first glance,
the **Dao/Way** seems distant from humanity.
But upon closer inspection,
its tranquil purity without admixture
shows that the **Dao/Way** is never truly absent.

Great fullness is like emptiness—
this is its proper state.

The later passages on *守雌* (keeping the female) and *守黑* (keeping the dark)
all speak of the constant **virtue/power** that is never lost—
this aligns with the present discussion.

When it says *"seems"* and *"as if,"*
it refers to what people cannot fully grasp.

If one gazes and is startled by its keen discernment,
quick wit, and agility,
it is merely talent and intelligence—
not the **Dao/Way**.

I do not know whose offspring it is,
nor whether it precedes the *Xiàngdì* (August Sovereign).
The **Dao/Way**’s essence is nonexistent—
truly the mother of Heaven and Earth,
yet Zhuangzi expands it, saying *"shén guǐ shén dì shēng tiān shēng dì"* (the divine spirits, divine sovereigns give birth to Heaven and Earth),
so the **Dao/Way** must indeed have existed before the August Sovereign.

The world has a beginning,
and this is called the mother of the world.
Having obtained its mother to know its offspring,
all things that arise from the **Dao/Way**
are its children.

This passage discusses the **Dao/Way**’s application,
summarizing the original and the nonexistent from the previous chapter,
and extending it to humanity.
If a person embodies the **Dao/Way** and can
make it empty so it does not overflow,
and obscure so it seems as if something exists,
then what they contain is nearly nonexistent.

If one is a person,
I do not know who could be its child.
Approximating its equal rank,
it might even precede the August Sovereign.
To speak deeply of **virtue/power** and align with the **Dao/Way**,
the world will find none who can surpass it.
To grasp its utmost excellence,
one might even precede the August Sovereign.

Discussing those who act in the world,
their affliction lies in their sharpness and swiftness
not being able to keep pace with events.
Yet the teachings of Laozi suppress and conceal,
fearing any exposure,
so their self-conduct is gentle, weak,
feminine, dark,
humble, lowly, and solitary—
unwilling to receive blame,
to take the lead, or to dare to act first.
This is not merely about
responding to events with non-interference—
there is a deeper principle.

The **Dao/Way** originates from nonexistence,
yet those who follow the **Dao/Way** all engage with existence.
If they dwell in existence and act in existence,
it is like using oil to wash oil—
only adding more filth,
with no way to attain purity.
Thus, one must root in nonexistence to govern existence,
and seek to eliminate existence to approach nonexistence.

Practicing with gentleness and resting in emptiness,
though not yet fully nonexistent,
is near to it.

When it says *"obtaining the mother to know the child,"*
and then *"knowing the child while still guarding the mother,"*
there is good reason for this.

From nonexistence, one observes existence,
and through existence, one comprehends nonexistence—
the inner and outer are always in accord.

It also says:
*"The weak are the **Dao/Way**’s application—*
the world’s myriad things are born from existence,
existence from nonexistence.
This is why the weak replace the strong,
knowing that existence must return to nonexistence."

The first chapter establishes the dual names of *有* (existence) and *无* (nonexistence),
summarizing the essence of the great **Dao/Way**.
This chapter contrasts *冲* (emptiness) and *盈* (fullness),
summarizing the practice of the **Dao/Way**.
If a person embodies the **Dao/Way** and reaches this point,
then Heaven and Earth cannot claim them as their children,
and entering from nonexistence to the original,
from the original to the wondrous,
there is nothing unattainable.

Zhān Qiūpǔ said:
*"The **Dao/Way** is empty, yet its application reaches before the August Sovereign.
The chapter on 'no source' states that the **Dao/Way** uses emptiness and subtlety,
so as not to overflow or be excessive,
but to be profound and hidden, nurturing all things as their sovereign root.
It must blunt its sharpness to become simple and unadorned,
untangle its confusion to become orderly,
then it can harmonize and illuminate,
mix with the dust of the world,
and this **Dao/Way**, profound and boundless,
is without source.
I do not know where it originates,
nor whether it precedes the August Sovereign’s authority—
how could one encounter it without seeing its beginning?"*

Zhāng Chōngyìng replied:
*"The **Dao/Way** is empty, yet its application reaches before the August Sovereign.
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the **Dao/Way**,
and the **Dao/Way** follows natural spontaneity.
The **Dao/Way** of natural spontaneity flows without interruption,
leaving no trace or form—
its emptiness is boundless,
its application ceaseless.
In spring, it is harmonious;
in summer, it is warm;
in autumn, it is clear;
in winter, it is frozen—
yet the yang nourishes and the yin distributes,
without any partiality or excess.
Humans, confined in their blood-flesh bodies,
endowed with yin-yang *qi*,
reach upward to Heaven,
walk downward on Earth,
and within hold natural spontaneity.
If one can empty this **Dao/Way** and apply it,
leading to no overflow or loss,
then the **Dao/Way** is profound and subtle,
and the body unifies with Heaven and Earth.
How could the myriad things fail to take it as their root?
Thus, when ambition is sharp,
one must retreat to blunt it—
lest Jiè Tuī perish in fire,
or Chú Nǚ die for a tree.
When affairs are chaotic,
one must simplify to resolve them—
lest the Six States be provoked to attack Qin,
or Jian Li die for a bright reputation.

To harmonize its light—
not relying on one’s own brilliance
to extinguish others’ brilliance,
one should be like the sun and moon shining together
without any loss of clarity.
To blend with the dust—
not relying on one’s own purity
to defame others’ purity,
one should be like pearls and jade falling into mud
without risk of harm or suspicion,
then this mind is deep and tranquil,
clear and without residue,
unaffected by chaos,
and the **Dao/Way** remains constant within it.

Thus, aligning with Heaven and Earth to enjoy longevity—
yet I do not know whose offspring it is,
preceding Heaven and Earth in establishing the **Dao/Way**,
and so embodying the August Sovereign’s authority before them."*

Zhāng Língyìng said:
*"Boldness and sharpness are the root of harmful *qi*;
chaos and excess are the source of lost essence."*

「To rely on one’s own brilliance is to risk injuring one’s spirit;
to be arrogant risks damaging one’s body.
Those who wish to learn the **Dao/Way** must be cautious here—
when encountering sharpness, they must blunt it,
when encountering chaos, they must dissolve it,
blending their light with that of others,
merging their dust with the common dust,
then the *qi* will not be harmful,
the essence will not be lost,
the spirit will not be injured,
and the body will not be damaged,
thus fulfilling the hope of longevity.

The *Dexing* ["Classic of Virtue"] in the chapter "Mysterious Virtue" again cites these four principles,
for those who seek to attain the realm of **Dao/Way** with virtue
must also heed these warnings.

Bái Yùchán said:
*"The **Dao/Way** is vast yet finds application—
sometimes appearing insufficient.
Within emptiness, it is profound.
Like the source of all things, it is the mind itself.
Blunt its sharpness, gather the spirit.
Dissolve its chaos, still the thoughts.
Blend its light, conceal the mind within the mind so it is unseen.
Merge its dust, blend the mind with the myriad things.
Deep and tranquil, it seems to exist—
preserving the spirit in the formless.
I do not know—
whose offspring it is,
embodying the August Sovereign’s authority before them."*

Liáo Cuìrán then replied:
*"The **Dao/Way** is vast yet finds application—
its *qi* is originally boundless and unrestrained,
yet it is without form to serve its purpose.
Sometimes it seems insufficient.
Profound, it is like water’s clarity and depth,
neither full nor overflowing,
appearing as the source of all things.
At rest, it is like the sea receiving all rivers;
in motion, all rivers flow toward the sea.
Blunt its sharpness—
when thoughts arise, strike them with one cut,
with the wisdom-sword that has no blade,
capable of severing all demons.
Dissolve its chaos—
all concerns vanish instantly,
not a thread remaining,
purifying the subtle vision,
bathing and nurturing the Golden Elixir.
Blend its light—
returning reflection inward,
desiring to restore its brilliance."*

「To grasp the origin of the elixir’s birth—
the moon’s glow shines night and day upon the Western Lands.
To blend with its dust.

Mind and body as one, form and virtue united,
the *block-and-fire* alchemy reversed—
dragons emerge from flames.
When the Five Phases act disorderly,
tigers are born in water.
Deep and still, it seems to linger yet persist.
Pure and unadulterated, its stillness is boundless,
its nature clear as heaven’s brilliance.
I do not know whose child it is,
yet it precedes the Sovereign’s likeness.
Who dares cast off the old and fails to recognize their own face?
This is ultimately called what?

The Supreme Way’s natural roots run deep—
immovable, where is it not honored?
Chen Bìxū said:
*"The Dao/Way is vast yet finds application—
sometimes it seems insufficient.
Vast (*chōng*), it is empty (*xū*), yet also central (*zhōng*).
Sometimes (*hù*), an undefined term—
also meaning constant (*cháng*).
It speaks of the Dao/Way using vastness and emptiness as its application.

For the *qi* of harmony is vast and empty,
thus it serves as the Dao/Way’s application.
The Sage attains the use of vast emptiness,
so the myriad chariots abandon their wealth.
The commoner attains the use of vast emptiness,
so the humble dwelling forgets its poverty.
Though seated in halls of power,
their mind is as still as those in mountain caves,
their body clad in coarse rags,
yet they do not differ from the adorned.
This is the profound attainment of vast emptiness,
yet it is never full or overflowing.

Yán Jūnping said:
*"To act as vast (*chōng*) yet not be vast,
to act as harmonious (*hé*) yet not be harmonious—
not acting as vast or harmonious,
yet truly attaining vastness and harmony.
Vastness resides in emptiness,
harmony has no fixed abode.
To be able to empty and to have no abode,
vastness overflows beyond measure.
To be able to have no abode and to empty,
harmony is ever-present.

This is the true attainment of the Dao’s vast and harmonious use,
yet it is never full or overflowing.
Central (*zhōng*), it means the application lies in harmony—
the Dao/Way, or perhaps, one who dares not speak its name.
Deep and still, it seems the source of all things.
Deep (*yuān*), it is profound stillness.
*Fū* (*兮*)—
a profound, resonant phrase to extol the Dao.
Understanding this Dao of vast emptiness,
neither lacking nor overflowing,
its nature congealed and deep beyond measure,
thus it is called *yuān* (deep).
The logic of the unfathomable—
neither existence nor non-existence,
hard to name definitively,
thus it is spoken of as if it were.

In daily life, it permeates all things,
pouring forth as boundless clarity,
embracing all phenomena,
guarding against harm and evil,
both motion and growth returning to it—
thus it is the source of all things.
To blunt its sharpness—
to suppress and curb its forward thrust,
its keen ambition for fame and gain.
To dissolve its chaos—
when thoughts rage and entangle,
inner and outer turmoil,
those who embody the Dao’s deep stillness
release its bonds, dissolve its chaos,
deep and clear, returning to its original nature.
Chaos (*fēn*), in the *River Master’s* text, is *fèn* (anger),
a knot of resentment.
It speaks of hidden malice and wrath,
anger and resentment tightly bound—
if one harbors the Dao’s vast harmony,
then all dissolves like ice in spring.

To blend its light—
deep and still, it seems to linger yet persist.
The Dao of utmost emptiness,
using vast harmony as its application,
its effects boundless yet never seen as full—
thus it never appears as overflowing.
The Dao’s measure is profound depth,
containing all things without distinction,
vast and minute, high and low—
all are embraced within.
Thus it is called the source of all things.
All things reverence the Dao.

To blunt its sharpness—
suppressing its outward edges,
no rigid angles.
To dissolve its chaos—
removing inner entanglements,
no clinging disturbances.
To blend its light—
penetrating both surface and core.
To blend with its dust—
merging with the common world.
Deep and tranquil, vast and boundless—
the Dao lies here.
Visible yet unseen,
heard yet unheard—
thus it is said to linger yet persist.
I do not know whose child it is,
yet it precedes the Sovereign’s likeness.

The Dao is within heaven and earth,
yet heaven and earth follow this Dao.
The Dao is within all things,
yet all things are born from this Dao.
Beyond the sky and soil,
back to the ancient beginning—
who can know the Dao’s origin?
This is unknowable.
Yet in metaphor, it precedes the Heavenly Sovereign.

It has been said:
There is the *beginning* (*shǐ*),
the *unbeginning* yet beginning (*wèishǐ yǒu shǐ*),
and the *unbeginning* yet *unbeginning* (*wèishǐ yǒu wèishǐ*).
In the ancient chaos,
dim and indistinct,
the Sage named it *Great Ease* (*Tàiyì*), vast and boundless,
flowing endlessly without end.
Then it was called *Great Initial* (*Tàichū*), the womb of confusion,
where presence and absence merge.
Then it was called *Great Commencement* (*Tàishǐ*), where sensation reveals itself,
sometimes existing, sometimes vanishing.
Then it was called *Great Purity* (*Tàisù*), neither turbid nor clear,
neither yin nor yang.

Only when reaching *Great Polarity* (*Tàijí*)
does it contain the Three as One,
all things’ original nature,
none lacking.
From this point onward,
generation endures without exhaustion.
Yet all are born from the Dao,
not able to birth the Dao.
One can be the Dao’s father,
yet cannot be its child.
One can be the Dao’s lord,
yet cannot be its subject.
Thus, the Dao truly has no origin—
where does it come from?」

「The Dao acts according to its own nature—
if birth is the Dao, then who else could it be?
Thus I say: *Before the beginning was the beginning* (*Wèi shǐ yǒu fú wèi shǐ yǒu shǐ zhě yě*).

Lin Yongzhi’s *Chang* states:
*The Dao is boundless yet its function reaches to the form before the Sovereign’s creation.*
Boundless (*chōng*) means emptiness (*xū*). Though the Dao’s essence is empty,
its function is inexhaustible—
sometimes overflowing, sometimes not,
adapting to the times without fixed measure.

Not saying “overflowing” or “not overflowing,”
but “sometimes overflowing, sometimes not,”
the very word *sometimes* reveals its meaning.

This is the art of language.
Deep (*yuān*) is beauty.
*Seem* (*sì*) is the use of ambiguous words to praise.

The root of all things (*wàn wù zhī zōng*)
is the *Great Master* (*Dà zōngshī*) as Zhuangzi speaks of it.
This Dao is sometimes present, sometimes absent—
if one does not understand the Dao,
they cannot know why it is called *the root of all things*.

*Dull its sharpness* (*cuò qí ruì*)—
its edges are worn smooth without any angles.

*Unravel its chaos* (*jiě qí fēn*)—
it remains orderly even amid confusion.

*Shine without revealing* (*guāng ér bù lù*), hence *harmonize its light* (*hé qí guāng*).
*Without dust yet not self-cleansing* (*wú chén ér bù zì jié*), hence *equalize its dust* (*tóng qí chén*).

*Profoundly subtle and faint* (*zhàn rán wēi máng*), yet unseen—
sometimes existing, sometimes vanishing,
seemingly present yet seemingly absent,
hence *profoundly, like existence* (*zhàn yī sì ruò cún*).

This is the *dim and indistinct* (*huǎng yī huò*).
Within it, there is substance.

I do not know whose child it is—
another ambiguous phrase to praise its mystery.

*Form* (*xiàng*) means *seem*.
*Sovereign* (*dì*) is *Heaven*.
It is said to exist before the Sovereign’s creation,
for its essence is empty yet its function boundless.

The words *form* and *seem* both describe
what is visible yet invisible,
knowable yet unknowable,
using such language to depict its marvel.

Fan Yingyuan says:
*The Dao is boundless yet its function reaches to the root of all things.*
Boundless (*chōng*) means emptiness (*xū*) and harmony (*hé*).
Deep (*yuān*) is profound.
*Seem* (*sì*) is because the Dao cannot be pointed to or named.

Its function is empty yet pervasive,
sometimes seemingly not overflowing—
for it is formless.
Yet profoundly deep, unfathomable,
it seems like the ancestral lord of all things.

*Dull its sharpness* until *profoundly, like existence*—
if one can use the Dao to blunt the edge of emotions and desires,
to unravel the chaos of affairs,
to refine the heart like a mirror without flashing its brilliance,
to blend with the dust of the world without staining its truth,
then the Dao is always *profoundly, like existence*—
sometimes appearing as if present.

I do not know whose child it is,
nor does it resemble the Sovereign’s creation.

Zhuangzi says:
*It exists before the Sovereign’s creation*—
whose child is this thing?

Xiu Xiu’an states:
*The Dao is boundless yet its function sometimes seems not to overflow*—
its function is poured into yet never full,
measured yet never exhausted.
*Profoundly, like the root of all things*—
the Dao’s essence is profound and still,
though it is the root of all things,
all things do not know how they are rooted in it,
hence *like the root*.

*Dull its sharpness* until *equalize its dust*—
those who embody the Dao blunt their sharp edges,
unravel their chaos,
harmonize their light without dazzling,
equalize their dust without obscuring.
*Profoundly, like existence*—
profoundly existing beyond all things yet not flowing,
as Zhuangzi says: *It nourishes things yet is not ensnared by them.*

I do not know whose child it is,
nor does it resemble the Sovereign’s creation.

Before the Five *Taos* (*wǔ tài*), whose child was it?
The Sovereign’s lord?

Chu Berniu’s *Bìxiū* states:
*The Dao is boundless yet its function sometimes seems not to overflow*—
the Dao gives birth to gods and spirits,
to the Sovereign and Heaven,
to Earth and all things,
yet it cannot be sought through form or named through words.
Empty yet moving,
it is nowhere absent,
thus it can govern all under Heaven,
respond to all sensations,
seemingly filling Heaven and Earth yet never truly full.

The Dao contains the *Original Qi* (*yuán qì*) yet is unseen,
yet its signs already exist within it—
the principles of giving birth to Heaven and Earth
originate from the utmost emptiness.

Its use depends on humanity—
it weaves through all transformations,
and only when one attains the realm of utter emptiness
can they employ this Dao.
With no fixed form or measure,
how could it ever overflow?

*Profoundly* (*yuān*), deep and still,
its divine brilliance emerges,
all transformations arise.
Things are born from existence (*yǒu*),
existence from non-existence (*wú*),
and its root is non-existence.

Once it emerges to become things,
it is only seemingly distinct from non-existence.

Ordinary people cling to traces of existence,
encountering obstacles at every turn.
Teaching them to blunt their sharpness prevents harm to things,
to unravel chaos preserves their selfhood,
to harmonize light without standing out,
to equalize dust without being swept away—
then *profoundly, like existence* can be seen.

Though seen clearly and believed firmly,
one does not know whence this thing was born,
nor whose child it is.

The Sovereign’s ruler is called *Heaven* (*dì*).
This thing seems to dwell even before the Sovereign,
exalted yet beyond exaltation—
nothing further to exalt.

In this chapter, there are ten sentences,
yet five use ambiguous words.
Some debate whether the Sage, upon seeing the Dao,
could penetrate its principles so clearly—
why speak of the Dao with so many ambiguities?

Fixed form means fixed name,
words have definite referents when examined thoroughly.
Once the Dao is named and called *Great*,
it cannot be commanded,
nor can it be pointed to and defined.
This is why it is said to be beyond naming.」

「If one clings rigidly to things in a single corner without allowing for transformation and flow,
then, as Zhuangzi says, it is *awakened yet as if lost and existing*—
*unformed yet spiritually manifest*, all things gathered yet unknown whence.

The Sage and Worthies speak of the Dao in this manner,
not from reluctance to speak, but because at this point words are insufficient.

Let the scholar delve deeply to grasp its clarity,
as one awakens from drunkenness—
the Sage’s teachings, earnest and unhidden, reveal themselves to you.

The *Mysteries of the Cow* say:
*The Dao is vast yet in use seems not to overflow.*

*Vast* means *central*—
the Dao’s essence contains all creation,
nurturing and giving birth to Heaven and Earth,
generating the Four Great Elements to precede them,
encompassing all dharmas yet standing alone supreme.

The Dao’s application is indeed great,
yet it is called *vast* because it does not indulge in self-satisfaction.
Thus, when we consider the meaning of *not overflowing*,
is it not fitting?

The *Taoist Sovereign* speaks of this to encourage humility and centrality,
and there is also the principle that *non-satisfaction naturally leads to overflowing.*

In the time of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors,
there was a vessel called the *Yòu Zhī* (Graceful Cup)
used for admonition.
When Confucius saw it, he instructed his disciples to fill it with water—
when upright, it held; when full, it tipped over.

Confucius sighed and said:
*"Good! This is the way of those who hold fullness."*

The ancients, wise and clear-sighted, took this as the highest warning,
often placing it beside their seats.

Does this not illustrate the Dao’s application in *centrality*?
*Profound yet like the ancestral source of all things.*

The ancestral source of all things is the Dao—
for the Dao gives birth to Heaven,
Heaven to Earth,
and Earth to all things,
thus it is called the ancestral source.

The Dao is the progenitor and ancestor of all things,
truly the most exalted.

Yet it is called *like* the ancestral source,
because it does not claim self-exaltation—
this is the language of humility.

This lesson teaches the world:
if one always practices humility and centrality,
then one naturally avoids *highness leading to peril.*

The *Book of Changes* says:
*"He who has greatness yet knows how to be humble will surely have good fortune."*
This is the case.

Thus the virtuous person, hearing much,
*restrains himself yet holds fast to it*;
with many aspirations,
*refines his nature yet conceals it*;
with profound understanding,
*simplifies his actions yet executes them with precision*.
Hence, when he stands above others, all revere him;
when he leads, none dare to harm him.

Therefore, the world willingly follows him without tiring—
why is this so?

It is because of his *humility and centrality.*

**Dulling the sharp.**
*Dulling* means *restraining*.
*Sharp* refers to *the cutting edges of speech and action*—
when a person’s *qi* is sharp,
sometimes it erupts from within,
manifesting in words—
the world calls this *lip-spears and tongue-swords*,
and at times it wounds others more than actual blades.

Thus the good and virtuous person,
how could he not tolerate all?
If he constantly reflects inward,
dulling his sharpness and restraining his *qi*,
then he will not recklessly harm others.

This is the meaning of *dulling the sharp.*

**Untangling the tumult.**
*Tumult* refers to *the clashing of conflicting emotions*.
*Untangling* means *self-discipline*.
When two joys arise, there will be many exaggerated praises;
when two angers arise, there will be many exaggerated reproaches.
If the *qi* of discontent surges within,
then exaggerated reproaches will burst forth,
and the two clash in resistance—
this is called *tumult and competition*.

Thus the great and virtuous person,
constantly restraining his discontent and checking his desires,
does not fall into contention and rivalry.

**Harmonizing his brilliance.**
*Brilliance* refers to *cleverness and innate talent*.
*Harmonizing* means *concealing and dimming*.
To *conceal* is to prevent cleverness from being displayed;
to *dull* is to prevent innate talent from being revealed.
Confucius, the greatest Sage,
in his native village appeared as if *without words*—
Yanzi, the greatest Worthies,
throughout the day spoke not, as if foolish.

These are all examples of *harmonizing his brilliance*.

I have heard from the ancients:
*"I am clever—what does cleverness avail me?"*
*"I am virtuous and capable—what do virtue and capability avail me?"*
If one boasts and relies upon them,
then one has already become small.

I only lower my *qi* to humility and harmony,
align my heart with uprightness and restraint,
submit my spirit to solemnity and reverence,
so that even the common folk can consult me,
and the ministers and great officials are all those I honor.
Yet I do not know that I am exalted,
and they do not know that they are low.

The *Book of Changes* says:
*"The virtuous person, when he presides over the people,
conceals his brilliance yet makes it clear—*
this is the case."

**Equalizing the dust.**
*Dust* refers to *obscurity and vulgarity*.
*Equalizing* means *treating all with equal benevolence*—
to *equalize benevolence* is to have no division between *darkness in others* and *clarity in oneself*;
to *view uniformly* is to have no distinction between *foolishness here* and *virtue there*.

In general, the Way of being a person
values *lowliness as the foundation*,
*humility as the base*—
thus the great and virtuous person,
constantly concealing his brilliance and yielding to the vulgar,
dulling his traces and blending with the dust,
knows that the world cannot be elevated,
so he descends;
knows that the people cannot be surpassed,
so he follows behind.
With warmth, respect, and careful virtue,
he makes others admire him;
by adopting the receptive and holding low,
none can surpass him.
Internally, he hides his wisdom and does not display his skills—
though I am exalted and high,
others do not harm me.
Though the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers flow to the left,
they are longer than all other streams,
because they can humble themselves.

The *Book of Changes* says:
*"By lowering the noble and elevating the humble,
one gains the people’s loyalty."*
Is this not the meaning of *harmonizing his brilliance* and *equalizing the dust*?

**Profound yet like existence.**
*Profound*—
this speaks of *non-existence* and *existence*,
of *having* and *being*—
the Dao’s essence seems *non-existent* yet *existing*,
*present* yet *as if lost*,
thus it is said: *profound yet like existence.*

This is why the ancients, wise and clear-sighted,
understood the Dao’s *having* and *non-having*—
constantly *dulling the sharp*, *untangling the tumult*,
*harmonizing their brilliance*, and *equalizing the dust*.

Then, what is the meaning of *embodying the Dao*?
The Dao’s teachings—
its essence is boundless,
its application infinite,
its nature inherent in all things,
neither lacking nor deficient.
It is obtained in human life at the beginning of *stillness*,
manifested in response at the moment of *natural flow*,
nurtured in the *unaroused emotions* of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight,
and realized when *intent and form* are both *non-existent*—
*serene yet correct*,
*profound yet clear*,
*dim yet vast as the Great Emptiness without dust*,
*flickering yet ordered as the four seasons*—
*non-action yet all things are done.*」

This is the teaching of *serene yet seemingly existent*—
I do not know whose child the Dao is, before the Emperor’s reign.

*"I"*—this is Laozi’s self-designation.
*"Whose"*—no name can be ascribed.
*"Child"*—refers to the Dao.
*"Like"*—as in *resembling*.
*"Emperor"*—human sovereign.

Just as the forms of Heaven, Earth, and myriad things,
their coming into being has its own origin—
when one speaks of mother and child,
only the single character *Dao* is naturally void and boundless,
its birth having no source—
thus, the Sage of Highest Clarity rightly says,
*"I do not know whose child the Dao is."*

For the Dao’s meaning,
when pushed to the limits of the unheard and unseen,
its subtlest aspect is difficult to name;
when concealed in the scentless, soundless Heaven,
its utmost essence is difficult to know.
Trace it forward—no beginning is seen to converge,
draw it backward—no end is seen to depart.
Who could know whose child the Dao is?

*"Like the Emperor before his reign"*—
Laozi once served as the Emperor’s teacher;
ancient Emperors once asked Laozi:
*"Of whom is the Dao the child?"*
The Sage of Highest Clarity thus said,
*"Like the Emperor before his sovereignty—*
what form, what appearance was it?"

Yang Zhiren says:
*"The Dao’s subtlety in its application is like the Emperor before his reign."*
The Dao’s subtlety in its application—
vigorous yet pure, empty yet not filled—
is thus the abyss of all things.
Humans may walk it:
dulling the sharp, untangling the tangled,
harmonizing within and yielding without,
aligning with waves and flowing with currents,
concentrating the mind internally,
letting the primordial *qi* surge and harmonize above and below,
subduing the restless monkey-mind from straying,
embodying nature’s serene stillness,
true and constant, unmoved—
having yet not having, real yet seemingly void,
illuminating inside and out,
revealing its own luminous clarity.

I do not know whose child the Dao is,
before the Emperor’s reign.
The ancients say: *"Do you still recognize this?"*

The Dao’s essence, neither lost through time nor ancient,
is plainly visible before one’s eyes.

Yu Qingzhong says:
*"The Dao’s subtlety in its application is like the Emperor before his reign."*

The Dao is like the sea—
for the Dao alone is void and thus receptive,
while the sea alone is vast and thus capacious.
The Dao’s essence is inherently void,
yet its application never strays beyond the subtlety of this emptiness.

The phrase *"never filled"*—
only when examined in the context of the following passage does its meaning become clear.

Among the things between heaven and earth,
none is as great as the sea—
the Dao is truly like it:
profound and deep, wondrous in its capacity.
Rivers and streams pour into it,
day and night without ceasing,
yet it never appears to be filled.
Some say *"never filled"*—
people often doubt its lack of fullness.
Yet where is its use concealed?
Does it not blunt the sharp within the unseen heavens?
Is this not the dulling of the keen?

Does it not transcend mundane entanglements
beyond the realm of right and wrong?
Is this not the untangling of the tangled?

*"Harmonizing its light"*—
it does not flaunt its brilliance to dazzle itself;
*"aligning with dust"*—
it does not compete in purity to turn away from filth.

「湛然」之二字，Yōngzhāi Lín Zhī [1]认为是微茫而不可见的状态，道本无形，在恍惚之间，指真空为实有，故曰似若存。

道超越于器物形象之外。我不知是哪位圣哲之子，却能精妙地体现它。Qīngyuán Liú Jì说：象是有形的开端，帝是生物的本源。有子之字，正下得象字。象，即肖也 [2]。犹如继世象贤之意。

Xū Liùxū说：道冲虚，而为月之至万物之宗。冲，即虚也；宗，即本也。夫至道冲虚，人皆具有，用之则弥满天地，乃至饮食起居，莫不显见。而曰*"或不盈"*者，谓其无形状可言而见，用言其动也。渊乎，言其静也，若水之停流，谓其静也。渊深明静，鉴照无穷，为万物之宗本，人乃万物之一也。

经曰*"似"*而不曰*"为"*，似即为也，且不欲直言之矣。挫其锐至似或存。这一段语盖以丁祝知道者，便不可止乎知而已。又须摧挫其锐利，追图之志，解释其纷乱之情，和融炫耀之光，混同尘世之俗，四者皆为知道者之病，须力去之，方除得浄，始可言冲虚至道，湛然常存矣。

似或，即常也。我不知其谁之子，象帝之先。象，即似也。老君谓冲虚至道，我不知其所由生，然究其极，似未天帝以先，卓然独立矣。

Lǐ Shì从说：道冲而用之至象帝之先。夫道者冲深潜行，而为用之*"或不盈"*者，无出其外也。渊乎似万物之宗者，心清若渊，观照万物，往来形影映现，业识所生，由此宗有也。挫其锐解其纷者，挫折其萌动之尖锐，解开其怨结之纷乱也。和其光同其尘者，和顺时俗所见之光，同其时俗所欲之尘也。湛然似若存者，返心内照，澄湛清平，见其真性，似若不离，常存定也。

Chái Yuángāo说：道太极冲中，虚而用之*"或不盈"*。体虚则用不竭，比如井虚不曾满，终日取用不竭，何况道乎？渊乎似万物之宗。如万水朝东，量不可测。挫其锐，解其纷。道体道用如此冲妙，则自己底刚锐纷争，外来底刚锐纷争，皆能挫解矣。和其光，同其尘。身中既冲虚，则外貌必和同顺境矣。湛然似若存。体虚则用处常不昧。我不知是哪位圣哲之子。不昧底是谁应用。象帝之先。太极以前那个。

Sū Jìngjìng说：道冲而用之至象帝之先。道在天地间，无一不有，无一不在，本为盈满，然道有理而无形，人以冲虚而用之，则有时疑其不盈。或云者，疑之也。冲虚用之，即后章*"知雄守雌"*之意。庄子曰*"雕琢复朴，无为名尸，无为谋府，无为事任，无为知主"*，此道盈而用之以冲虚也。万物之宗。宗，祖也。万物自无而生。渊，深也，其渊深不可测，为万物之祖。不盈则未能遽及乎，亦似之而已。既曰*"或"*，又曰*"似"*，正以道非不盈，用之以虚，则虚非真虚，故曰*"或"*曰*"似"*。

首章以有无二名，总道之要。此章冲盈对立，总道之用。则由无而玄，由玄而又玄，妙不可及矣。

*《拾遗》* Yuántīshī说：在光同光，在尘同尘。秉文此章首尾，言道挫锐解纷，和光同尘。

「The inferior knowers do not speak of *chapters* [of the Dao]. Those who speak of humans embodying the Dao and achieving absolute dependence on and alignment with its mysterious depths are not merely conforming to the ways of the world.

*The Commentary on the Various Schools* states: *"The Dao has sentiment and trustworthiness, yet it acts without form or design. It can be transmitted but not clung to*#2*, obtained but not seen. From its own root and origin, before heaven and earth existed, it has endured from antiquity. It encompasses gods and spirits, emperors and lords, giving rise to heaven and earth—yet it does not claim precedence over the Supreme Ultimate (太极), nor does it dwell beneath the Six Extremes (六极) as something profound. It precedes the birth of heaven and earth yet is not deemed ancient, and it surpasses the Upper Antiquity (上古) yet is not considered aged.*

The Stone Cavern Master (石潭) remarks: *"The Dao is vast yet when applied may seem insufficient, deep as if it were the ancestral source of all things.*"

冲 means *emptiness/void*. Emptiness prevents fullness; emptiness without fullness means no manifestation, and no manifestation means profound depth. Hence, it is called *vast and deep*. Though it is said to be unmanifest, it is indeed the ancestral source of all things. The word *seem* (似) implies that the Dao cannot be definitively named.

*Ancestral source* (宗) refers to the primordial origin from which all things arise, affirming that all things emerge from the Dao.

To *blunt its sharpness* (挫其锐) means to remove its exposed facets; to *dissolve its turbulence* (解其纷) means to disperse external disturbances. To *harmonize its radiance* (和其光) means to conceal its brilliance so it is not seen externally. To *align with the dust* (同其尘) means to blend with the world’s impurities without standing apart. *Luminous yet seemingly present* (湛兮似若存) conveys the Dao’s clarity and enduring presence, though it appears as if it were not always there.

I do not know whose offspring this is—it precedes the Heavenly Sovereign (天帝).

The Dao is the origin and ancestral source of all things. I do not know whose offspring this Dao itself is, for even the term *ancestral source* (宗) suggests the Dao has its own origin. Yet it is further described as *preceding the Heavenly Sovereign*—where *sovereign* (帝) means the Heavenly Emperor, and *seeming* (象) implies its presence before him. Though named as the mother of all things, it is truly the beginning of heaven and earth. Heaven and earth arise from it, so the Dao precedes the Heavenly Sovereign. This shows that the Dao is not only the ancestral source of all things but also the ancestral source of heaven and earth itself.

This entire passage speaks of the Dao’s essence, not of those who embody the Dao.

**Volume Ten of *The Collected Meanings of the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* – Observations on the Profound and Distant Dao by Master Constant Virtue (凝远大师常德路)**

**Chapter on "Heaven and Earth Lack Virtue" (天地不仁章)**

*Variants in Transmission:*
The *River Above Master* (河上公) titled this *"Chapter on Empty Use"* (虚用章),
while *Master Zhao Shi’an* (赵实庵) called it *"Chapter on the Just Conduct of Great Transformation"* (大化公行义章).

*Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Commentary:*
The preceding chapter expounds the ineffable Dao in its spontaneous, non-acting state—
existing in use yet without deliberate action.

This chapter reveals how partial favor breeds selfishness,
and selfishness makes universal benevolence difficult.
It first likens all things to fodder and dogs,
showing how heaven and earth equally forget them.
Next, it compares the space between heaven and earth to a *tuóqiào* (橐钥, bellows),
demonstrating how the Dao’s emptiness yields boundless function.
It concludes with the warning that excessive speech and action exhaust one’s essence,
urging adherence to the central harmony of *zhōnghé* (中和).

*Master Du Guangting’s (杜光庭) Observation:*
If one clings to "virtue" as virtue, then there is attachment;
if one does not regard transformation as virtue, then there is no selfishness.

The sovereign’s gaze upon all living beings
is like heaven and earth’s regard for all things.
All things arise and transform of their own accord—
heaven and earth do not claim credit for their work.
The myriad folk dwell and thrive as they will—
the sovereign does not take merit for their sustenance.
He relies on the wondrous *qi* to animate and shape,
and on the mysterious transformation to bring forth life—
this is the ultimate transformation.

If one speaks of their virtue and kindness,
logic will itself reach exhaustion.
Why?
The virtue of heaven and earth is vast—
yet grasses and trees flourish in summer and wither in winter.
The virtue of the sovereign is vast—
yet laws decree exile and execution.
Such virtue is not as great as that which does not cling to virtue as virtue,
but instead follows the natural flow and preserves the tranquil stillness—
the essential secret for nurturing one’s body.

*Master Zhang Chongying’s (张冲应) Response:*
"Emptiness" means "voidness."
The boundless void contains no forms,
yet between heaven and earth it moves and functions—
without sound or scent,
yet all things arise from it, endlessly.
If humans attune to this emptiness and employ it,
then the Dao will achieve nothing it cannot perfect.

Heaven and earth lack virtue,
treating all things as fodder and dogs.
The sage lacks virtue,
treating the people as fodder and dogs.
Between heaven and earth,
is it not like the bellows?

The bellows is empty within,
yet produces sound and breath.
Empty yet unexhausted,
moving yet ever more abundant.
Excessive speech and action lead to depletion—
better to guard the central harmony.

*Variant in Transmission:*
"Empty yet ever more abundant" (虚而愈出) is also rendered as "empty yet abundantly yields" (虚而俞出).

*River Above Master’s (河上公) Explanation:*
Heaven and earth lack virtue—
they bestow life and transformation without sentiment,
acting purely by nature’s course.
They treat all things as fodder and dogs—
for though heaven and earth produce all beings,
humans are the most precious.
Yet they regard them as mere grasses and beasts,
demanding no repayment in return.

The sage lacks virtue—
the sage nourishes the people without sentiment,
following heaven and earth’s example,
acting by nature’s course.
He treats the people as fodder and dogs—
the sage regards them like grasses and beasts,
demanding no gratitude or reverence.

Between heaven and earth—
the space between heaven and earth is empty and tranquil,
and harmonious *qi* flows through it,
so all things arise spontaneously.
If humans eliminate desires and emotions,
moderate tastes and pleasures,
purify the five viscera,
then the spirit will dwell within them.

Like the bellows—
the bellows is hollow within,
yet produces sound and breath when moved.
Empty yet unexhausted,
moving yet ever more abundant—
it speaks of an emptiness that cannot be depleted,
and movement that never ceases to yield sound and breath.

Excessive speech leads to depletion—
excessive action harms the spirit,
excessive speech harms the body.
When the tongue moves and words multiply,
disaster and calamity follow.
Better to guard the central harmony—
better to cultivate virtue within,
nourishing the spirit,
treating *qi* as precious,
and speaking sparingly.

*Master Wang Fusi’s (王辅嗣) Interpretation:*
Heaven and earth lack virtue,
treating all things as fodder and dogs—
for they act by nature alone,
without contrivance or design.
All things regulate themselves naturally,
so heaven and earth do not interfere.

If one clings to virtue, they must contrive and impose transformations,
entertaining thoughts and actions.
Contrived transformations cause things to lose their authenticity,
and deliberate actions prevent their natural completion.
If things cannot complete naturally,
then they cannot fully sustain life.

The earth does not cultivate fodder for beasts,
yet beasts eat fodder;
the earth does not breed dogs for humans,
yet humans eat dogs.
Without action toward all things,
yet all things find their proper place,
and their use is never wanting.

If kindness stems from one’s own contrivance,
it is insufficient and unreliable.

The sage lacks virtue,
treating the people as fodder and dogs—
for the sage aligns with heaven and earth’s virtue,
comparing the people to fodder and dogs.

Between heaven and earth,
the movement is boundless yet ever more abundant.
Within the bellows,
the emptiness is void of desires and actions,
so it cannot be exhausted or depleted,
and its movement is never spent.

Between heaven and earth,
the natural flow is boundless,
just as the bellows—
excessive speech leads to depletion,
yet guarding the central harmony prevents exhaustion.
The more one acts,
the more one loses.
To establish harm in things,
and to misplace words in actions,
is to invite inevitable depletion.
If one guards the bellows’ central harmony,
then there is no exhaustion,
and if one abandons self to follow things,
then all will be in order.

If the bellows had intent to produce sound,
it would fail to meet the demands of those who blow it.

*Emperor Xuanzong’s (唐明皇) Commentary:*
From "Heaven and earth lack virtue" to "the people as fodder and dogs"—
"lacking virtue" means they do not perform acts of virtue and kindness.
"Fodder and dogs" refers to the ritual practice of binding straw into dog shapes for sacrifice.

Dogs are kept for guarding and defense,
so their owners expect loyalty and vigilance in return.
But the sacrificial dogs are mere forms,
without the capacity to bark or protect—
so their virtue is not as profound as that of the living.

It is said that heaven and earth regard humans
as humans regard sacrificial dogs—
without expectation or demand.

I have examined this further:
The ultimate virtue knows no partiality—
who then embodies universal love?
If love is partial,
it is not ultimate—
it is merely selfish favor.

If one does not love only their own kin,
then all under heaven are kin.
If one does not treat only their own children as children,
then all under heaven are children.

Thus, ultimate virtue is not partial—
it is the most inclusive.
How could it be universal love?

*Commentary:*
"Virtue" here is the natural expression of universal love.
"Fodder and dogs" refers to the ritual practice of binding straw into dog shapes for sacrifice.

Today, heaven and earth’s ultimate virtue
manifests in the creation and sustenance of all beings—
like humans binding straw into dog shapes,
they do not expect the dogs to bark or guard,
nor do they regard their creation as an act of virtue or kindness.
Hence, it is said they lack virtue.

The Sage abides in *yòu* (indulgence/forgiveness),
and thus views all under heaven’s people likewise.

*Commentary:*
The "priceless favor of a worn mat" (*bìgài zhī ēn*)—
Confucius said in the *Records of Rites*:
*"A worn mat is not discarded—it is for burying a dog."*

*"Not only loving one’s own kin"*—
this is the text of *The Rites of Zhou*.

Between heaven and earth,
it is like the *tuó* and *yuè*—
*Tuó* is the *tāo* (leather bag),
*Yuè* is the *dí* (reed pipe).
When the bag is struck to fan the wind,
and the pipe is played to direct the breath,
both rely on emptiness and no-mind,
thus they move and yet have response.

Therefore, the utmost things between heaven and earth,
being without private favor,
are also because of emptiness and no-mind.

Empty yet unyielding,
moved yet ever more forth.
The *tuó* and *yuè* are empty yet unyielding—
when plucked, they emit sound and breath ever more,
illustrating how the Sage’s heart, without partial love,
has no time of yielding or obstruction,
its applications endless—
truly moved yet ever more forth.

*Commentary:*
*Tuó* is *tāo*—a leather bag used to fan wind to kindle fire.
*Yuè* is the *dí* (reed pipe).
It says that heaven and earth create all beings like straw dogs,
for their space is empty,
thus they generate without private favor and without expectation,
just as the *tuó* fans wind and the *dí* directs breath.
Those who constantly seek response
find no emotion in me.

Thus, when emptied, there is no yielding or obstruction,
when moved, sound and breath emerge ever more—
illustrating how a ruler, with an empty and silent heart,
purely harmonizing and uniformly transforming,
has no yielding or obstruction,
ever in daily use, yet unknown—
moved yet ever more forth.

Many words lead to exhaustion;
better to hold the Center.
Many words do not bear fruit,
thus they exhaust and bend,
while universal love is hard to extend,
leading to resentment and hatred—
thus it is better to embrace and guard the Middle Way,
and all will naturally suffice.

*Commentary:*
"Many words" refers to excessive talk of universal love.
Excessive talk of universal love,
yet in practice it cannot be fully extended,
thus it exhausts and bends without fulfillment—
this shows why it is better to forget concerns and respond emptily,
embracing and guarding the Middle Way,
so that all will naturally align.

"Not bearing fruit" means
*chóu* (answer)—
speaking without action in return.

Du Guangting said:
*"Heaven and earth’s lack of virtue makes all under heaven like straw dogs."*

Ancient sacrificial rites included figures for use,
modeled after their forms,
placed among the ritual vessels—
thus the setting of straw dogs.
Dogs bark and guard,
yet straw dogs serve no such purpose.
Heaven and earth’s view of all things,
the Sage’s view of the people,
is like that of straw dogs—
they do not demand barking or guarding,
nor do they regard creation as virtue or kindness,
nor do they expect repayment.
If their virtue is not displayed,
then it is said they lack virtue.

Humans toward dogs have the favor of a worn mat and burial,
yet toward straw dogs, there is no such favor—
this clearly shows the Sage does not consider universal love as virtue.

*"Worn mat"*—
the *Records of Rites* [missing character] *Tán Gōng* says:
When Confucius’ dog died,
he had Zigong bury it.
The Master said:
*"I have heard—
a worn mat is not discarded—
it is for burying a horse.
A prince’s carriage horse, when dead, is buried with a mat,
and a worn mat is not discarded—
it is for burying a dog.
I am poor, with no mat,
so at its burial, I gave it a mat instead,
so its head would not sink into the earth.
I feared its head would lie straight in the soil."*

*"Not only loving one’s own kin"*—
the text of *The Rites of Zhou* says:
*"When the Great Dao prevails,
all under heaven is public—
not only loving one’s own kin,
not only regarding one’s own children as children.
It is universal love for all things,
pushing toward the public and acting impartially,
not indulging in partial love."*

Between heaven and earth,
the utmost movement is ever more forth.

「The *tú* is a leather bag that beats the wind,
the *yuè* is a bamboo pipe that guides the *qi*.
The *tú* beats the wind without the *yuè* to guide it—
the *yuè* guides the *qi* without the *tú* to beat it.
Both must rely on each other in their operation,
as heaven and earth rely on the *tú*,
and the five *qi* on the *yuè*.
They hold emptiness and movement within themselves
to give birth to all the myriad transformations,
yet never falter or exhaust themselves.

A sovereign empties his heart and follows the Dao,
his ministers embody his virtue and enact his transformations,
just as heaven and earth move the five *qi* without exhaustion—
then governance knows no obstruction,
and the four seas enjoy peace.
The more it moves, the more its sound and *qi* emerge,
its words endless.

When the *qi* are pure and transformations uniform,
the virtue of purity and harmony pervades all things.
If one does not know of its daily use—
*The Book of Changes* [□ *Xì* *Yǐnyǔ*] says:
*"The myriad regions and common folk,
rely on the use of this Dao to obtain life,
yet do not know of the Dao’s functional power,
so they do not regard function as function—
the common folk use it without knowing."*

*Qū* is exhaustion,
*náo* is disorder.
Excessive words lead to depletion,
excessive affairs lead to harm—
excessive words, when they fail to respond,
bring exhaustion and obstruction.
Governance through excessive words means
frequent issuance of decrees,
morning orders and evening reversals—
this is called depletion.

Excessive words in governing oneself—
its faults are clear.
Thus, one lost word cannot be recalled,
let alone many lost words—
how could there be no disgrace?

The spoken word departs from the firm and clings to the disparate,
turning white into black.
To guard against words is as crucial as to guard against rivers—
one must be cautious indeed.

Better to remain silent and guard the central harmony—
for the state, this does not exhaust its governance,
for oneself, this does not invite disgrace.
Loving the *qi* and sparing words,
holding virtue within,
practicing instruction without speech—
this is true excellence.

The *Sòng Dàojūn* said:
*"Heaven and earth do not transform until the common folk become fodder and dogs.*
Favor arises from harm,
harm arises from favor.
If one calls benevolence ‘favor,’
then harm follows inevitably.
Heaven and earth’s regard for all things,
the sage’s regard for the common folk—
they assist in their natural course,
without the heart of partial love or gain.
Benevolence cannot be named in this way.

Binding fodder to make a dog,
used in sacrifices,
once its purpose is fulfilled, it is discarded—
passersby trample its head and body,
woodcutters burn its limbs.
Heaven and earth’s regard for all things,
when spring brings birth and summer growth—
if they have benevolence and love,
it extends to autumn and winter,
when all things wither and fall—
this is not heaven and earth’s lack of love,
but the natural order of things.
The sage does not act with partial benevolence,
treating the common folk as fodder and dogs.
Indeed, the sage extends righteousness and benevolence to all under heaven—
if his benevolence reaches the affairs of men,
there are sequences of beginning and end,
changes of life and death—
this too is the natural order of things.
This is not loving first and enduring later,
but the natural unfolding of principle.
Thus, it is said:
‘Not benevolent’—
yet this is the ultimate benevolence.

*Zhuāngzi* said:
*"The Perfect Man has no kin,
the Great Man is not benevolent."*
This aligns with the above.

Between heaven and earth,
the utmost movement is ever more forth.
The Dao has no form,
no fixed direction—
with the *qi* of boundless harmony,
it beats and moves between heaven and earth,
nurturing all things,
like the *tú* and *yuè* being empty yet unobstructed,
moving yet ever more forth.
Excessive words lead to depletion—
better to guard the central harmony.

When words are spoken, they have form and direction—
grand speech is how the Dao is clarified.
Words imply intent,
intent cannot avoid error—
thus, excessive words lead to depletion,
and it is better to guard the central harmony
to respond to all changes.

*Sū Yǐngbīn* said:
*"Heaven and earth are not benevolent until the common folk become fodder and dogs.*
Heaven and earth have no partiality,
but listen to all things’ natural course—
thus, all things arise and perish of their own accord.
Death is not my doing to harm them,
life is not my doing to bestow benevolence.
Like binding fodder into a dog for sacrifice,
once the ritual is complete, it is cast aside—
passersby trample it—
is this hatred?
It is merely the natural unfolding of time.
After the sacrifice, it is discarded,
trampled upon—
is this not love?
It is also the natural unfolding of time.
The sage’s regard for the people is the same.
If he does not harm them,
the people preserve their nature,
life and death, gain and loss—
I have no part in it.
Though I have not acted with benevolence,
my benevolence is grand indeed.

Between heaven and earth,
the utmost movement is ever more forth.»

The bellows and the key—
when their movement reaches,
nothing resists its sway.
The unknowing praise their craft as supreme,
yet what purpose do bellows and keys serve?
They are empty yet unyielding,
thus their motion ever overflows.

Between heaven and earth,
their birth and death of all things,
their carving of myriad punishments—
such is their way alone.

Much speech exhausts itself,
yet nothing surpasses abiding in the Center.

Seeing motion overflow,
they fail to grasp it as the response of the Void-Center.

Thus I tell them:
Much speech exhausts itself,
yet nothing surpasses abiding in the Center’s boundlessness.

Lü Jiufu said:
Heaven and earth are not benevolent,
treating all things as sacrificial dogs.
The Dao of Heaven is obscure before the Formless Sovereign,
yet who knows its origin?
Then how can one who embodies this Dao be called benevolent?

The heart—
merely human heart—
yet heaven and earth embody this Dao,
needing no benevolence,
treating all things as sacrificial dogs.

The full meaning of "sacrificial dog":
its purpose in ritual.
Received, it serves without use,
yet cannot be omitted.

Like heaven and earth toward things—
no intent toward them,
yet seemingly no love,
yet in spring’s birth and summer’s growth,
it seems there is love.

The sage toward the people—
thus it is also.

The sage is not benevolent,
treating the people as sacrificial dogs.
The sage embodies this Dao,
needing no contention over benevolence,
treating the people as sacrificial dogs.

The sacrificial dog—
a thing contended over for no benevolence,
yet kept.

All things share substance with heaven and earth,
the people share substance with the sage.
Heaven and earth, the sage—
viewing themselves as sacrificial dogs,
thus their regard for all things and the people is so.

Between heaven and earth,
motion ever overflows.
Yet in nurturing, raising, growing, and fostering—
what need for benevolence?

Only the not-benevolent
is called great benevolence.

Thus between heaven and earth,
its principle of bellows and keys
is clearly seen.

The bellows and the key—
only because they are empty yet unyielding,
their motion ever overflows.

Much speech exhausts itself,
yet nothing surpasses abiding in the Center.

Thus the person who embodies this Dao—
speech arises from non-speech,
speech without speech,
knowing how speech speaks.

Thus much speech exhausts itself,
yet abiding in the Center is the true endeavor.

Lü Nóngshī said:
Heaven and earth are not benevolent,
treating all things as sacrificial dogs.
Heaven and earth toward all things,
the sage toward the people—
calm and unattached,
yet not clinging to benevolence,
using them as fitting,
discarding them when past—
thus it is said:
The sacrificial dog—
before its use, adorned in wicker baskets,
covered in embroidered cloth;
after its use,
passersby trample its head,
woodcutters burn its body.
This is what is meant by:
using them as fitting,
discarding them when past.

Between heaven and earth,
motion ever overflows.
Heaven and earth are not benevolent,
treating all things as sacrificial dogs.
The sage is not benevolent,
treating the people as sacrificial dogs.
Moving with the world,
drifting with the times,
yet not bound to past traces,
nor entangled in what has been trodden—
thus able to sound when entered,
fall silent when not,
and know the bellows and keys.

Thus it is said:
Between heaven and earth,
is it not like the bellows and keys?
Empty yet unyielding,
moving yet ever overflowing,
much speech exhausts itself,
yet nothing surpasses abiding in the Center.

Empty yet without yielding—
no place to yield.
Moving yet ever overflowing—
something to demonstrate.
Without yielding yet with demonstration—
this is the numinous.

Empty, without yielding,
moving yet with demonstration—
thus able to respond to things’ impulses,
speaking as such,
yet never exhausted.

As for reciting ancient soil-mounds,
discussing the former kings’ sacrificial dogs,
yielding to past traces,
clinging to what has been trodden—
seeking to act in the age of decline,
this is why much speech exhausts itself,
yet abiding in the Center is ever more so.

This entire passage
aligns broadly with Zhuangzi’s intent on sacrificial dogs.

Wang Yuanzé said:
Heaven and earth are not sevenfold,
treating all things as sacrificial dogs.
The sacrificial dog—
used in ritual,
when in use, solemn rites and respect are paid.
When the ritual ends,
it is cast aside and trampled,
equal to filth—
yet in the time of solemn rites and respect,
it was not without sincerity.
Yet it was merely bound fodder shaped as a dog—
what was there truly to revere?

Though unworthy of reverence yet revered—
this was not falsehood.
All things each attain their due,
life and death returning to the soil,
nature’s course is as it must be.
Yet heaven and earth alone are their parents,
so they cannot but love.
Yet probing heaven and earth’s intent—
what attachments remain?

Thus in their time of love,
though with utmost sincerity,
all things proceed naturally,
truly nothing to love.
Yet at their end,
all return to the same dust—
where is the lingering affection?

The sage is not sevenfold,
treating the people as sacrificial dogs.
Benevolence—
human benevolence.
To love things with human virtue is benevolence,
yet those who bear human form yet are of Heaven—
how can they be named so?

Thus the sage loves the near and benevolences the people,
hence speaks only of the people—
yet their Dao is one with heaven and earth.
Yet bearing human form,
their responsibilities differ.

Between heaven and earth,
motion ever overflows.
The bellows and keys—
empty, responding to things,
impulsed, then responding,
responding yet not hoarding.

Heaven and earth toward all things,
the sage toward the people—
responding as it must,
yet no attachment to the moment,
no lingering on the past,
thus the bellows and keys’ boundlessness.

Empty yet unyielding—
emptiness of substance.
Moving yet ever overflowing—
movement of function.

Excessive speech often leads to exhaustion—
better to hold fast to the Center.

Without speech, one is exhausted;
with speech, one becomes known.
Yet the sage’s work is to speak yet not act.

Holding fast to the Center
is how one responds to all transformations.

Liu Zhongping said:
*"Heaven and Earth are not benevolent,
they treat all things as straw dogs.*

*Sevenfold compassion—
this is how love is brought to fruition.*
*As for straw dogs—
if one shows compassion to govern love, it is acceptable,
but if one shows no compassion yet still brings love to fruition, it is also acceptable.*

*When they are at their height,
woven in baskets, adorned with silk embroidery,
the priests and attendants observe strict rites,
then carry them forth—
as if showing compassion to govern love.
But when their backs are trampled by passersby,
when they are burned by woodcutters,
and they are discarded, scattered, and reduced to dust—
then there is no longer compassion to govern love.*

*Heaven and Earth are thus as well.*
*When thunder and wind stir,
when dew and rain nourish,
covering, embracing, nurturing,
giving life to those who would live,
fulfilling those who would grow,
so that all with form stand firm,
all with nature are completed—
as if showing compassion to bring love to fruition.*

*But when frost and hail, ice and snow descend,
cruel and merciless,
breaking, bending, destroying,
so that the sun dares not advance,
the light dares not shine,
the great are ruined, the small perish,
the strong are shattered, the weak annihilated—
then there is no compassion to bring love to fruition.*

*Thus it is said:
Heaven and Earth are not benevolent,
they treat all things as straw dogs.*

*The sage is not benevolent,
he treats the people as straw dogs.*
*It is not only that Heaven and Earth treat all things thus,
the sage treats the people likewise.*

*When he moves them with grace,
disturbs them with teaching,
when grace overflows and kindness flows,
when the people respond with warmth and labor,
with sighs and murmurs—
as if nurturing an infant,
as if showing compassion to bring love to fruition.*

*But when crimes are great, they are killed;
when crimes are small, they are punished—
limbs severed, bodies torn,
dragged, stoned, burned, abandoned,
left sprawled in the marketplace,
scattered across the wilderness,
while walled cities weep with severed ears,
and the capital flows with blood—
then there is no compassion to govern love.*

*Thus it is said:
The sage is not benevolent,
he treats the people as straw dogs.*

*Between heaven and earth,
motion ever overflows.*
*Because they hold no attachment to love or its absence,
this is how Heaven and Earth attain their numinous power.*

*The numinous has what it demonstrates,
yet nothing to constrain it—
because it is unconstrained,
it is like the bellows and keys:
empty yet unyielding.*
*Because it has what it perceives,
its non-action becomes clear.*

*Manifested in the body as speech,
seen in affairs as principle—
sometimes spoken, sometimes acted,
yet in essence, one and the same.*

*Why so?*
*Speech is its substance—
nothing more.*
*To fail to know this*
*is to let speech not emerge from non-speech.*
*If speech does not emerge from non-speech,*
*it diverges from the bellows and keys’ empty motion.*

*Thus its excess leads to exhaustion—
how could it be otherwise?*

*Confucius said:*
*"Who now sings these songs?*
*To know this is to know speech emerges from non-speech."*

*Speech emerges from non-speech—
no one escapes this.*
*Yet those who cannot*
*are those whose hearts cling to having rather than non-having,*
*to taking rather than letting go,*
*and thus fail to align with the Dao.*

*Neither having nor non-having,*
*neither taking nor letting go—*
*yet aligning with the Dao—*
*this is called holding fast to the Center.*

*Holding fast to the Center without ceasing,*
*it moves like the bellows and keys, ever overflowing.*
*Thus it is said:*
*Between heaven and earth,*
*is it not like the bellows and keys?*

*Empty yet unyielding,*
*moving yet ever overflowing—*
*this is how the sage models Heaven and Earth.*

*Excessive speech often leads to exhaustion—*
*better to hold fast to the Center.*

*Speech is how one responds to things.*
*Indeed, modeling Heaven and Earth,*
*the sage emerges—*
*inevitably responding to things with speech.*
*Yet if speech is excessive,*
*it fails to conform to principle and stop.*
*If it fails to conform to principle and stop,*
*it cannot be extended and put into practice.*

*Only by holding fast to the Center*
*does one’s speech neither multiply nor diminish,*
*always conforming to principle and stopping.*
*Thus it can be extended and put into practice,*
*and exhaustion will not often befall it.*

*Hence it is said:*
*Excessive speech often leads to exhaustion—*
*better to hold fast to the Center.*

*Those who hold fast to the Center*
*speak neither excessively nor sparingly.*
*Yet why does Laozi so vehemently oppose excessive speech?*

*He clarifies the Dao—*
*The Dao is ever without speech,*
*yet ever with speech,*
*for the Dao cannot help itself.*
*Thus it can be spoken of,*
*because it is ever without speech.*
*The fewer the words,*
*the closer one is to the Dao.*
*The more the words,*
*the farther one strays from the Dao.*
*Hence his vehement opposition to excessive speech.*

*Liu Jujie said:*
*"The sage is not benevolent,*
*he treats the people as straw dogs.*
*Nothing is more cruel than war and punishment,*
*yet even the most virtuous cannot abolish them—*
*only follow their logic.*

*Sometimes speaking of all things,*
*sometimes of the people—*
*each has its proper order.*

*Between heaven and earth,*
*motion ever overflows.*
*This further explains Heaven and Earth.*

*The two intervals of Heaven and Earth*
*can be empty,*
*thus they find their stopping point.*
*Empty—*
*this is the substance of the bellows and keys,*
*unyielding because of its emptiness.*

*The bellows and keys’ function—*
*the bellows moves with wind,*
*the keys move with qi,*
*moving only to respond,*
*thus their resonance grows.*

*Excessive speech often leads to exhaustion—*
*better to hold fast to the Center.*

*Heaven and Earth respond to all things with emptiness,*
*yet speak not at all.*
*The sage also responds to the people with emptiness,*
*yet when waves of disturbance arise,*
*it is not speech that sustains them—*
*only that excess is avoided.*

*The Classic of Changes says:*
*"Excessive speech leads to exhaustion."*
*The Center’s substance is one—*
*worthy of being held fast to.*
*The Center’s function is empty—*
*capable of response,*
*just as Heaven and Earth are called intervals.*

The *New Sayings of the Chancellor* states:
The sage is not virtuous/ren,
yet treats the people as grass-dogs.*

The stillness is unsoiled,
the purity is unstained,
yet their sacrifices suffice to honor ritual.
Yet the reverence of the grass-dog—
at its beginning, when it is to be used,
it is adorned with embroidered patterns,
stored in ornate cases.
Once used, the travelers tread upon its head,
the woodcutters cook its body,
yet it does not cling to what it loves,
nor does it adhere to what it possesses.
When appropriate, it is employed;
when fitting, it is released—
when excessive, it is discarded,
when seasonable, it is followed.
Yet the sage’s virtue/ren,
how could it be far from this?

The Dao of Heaven cannot generate life,
yet life’s generation belongs to the True Lord,
and the True Lord never generates.
The Dao of Earth cannot transform,
yet transformation belongs to the True Sovereign,
and the True Sovereign never transforms—
thus virtue/ren manifests in all things.
Therefore, all things within Heaven and Earth,
in form and sound, color and essence,
are governed by me,
yet things cannot be distant.
When life is generated and transformation complete,
they enter and are concealed in use—
thus things have their kinds and groups,
each clinging or departing as naturally fits,
yet forgetting their origin in me,
yet things cannot be close.

Though so, Heaven generates but cannot complete,
Earth completes but cannot govern—
the sage emerges to govern it.
Thus, virtue/ren is displayed in form,
and when it emerges,
it shares in the calamities of joy and sorrow,
so all things’ births are aided and sustained,
their proper order never lost—
virtue/ren concealed in use.
When it retreats,
even the sage does not share its cares,
thus its traces vanish, its heart grows dark,
and it views things as strange.

Ah! The sage’s relation to Heaven and Earth—
how could it be weighed down by virtue/ren toward the people and all things?
Thus, when things emerge,
the sage emerges with them, unhesitant—
when things retreat,
the sage retreats with them, undeterred.
It gives birth without possession,
acts without reliance,
nurtures without control,
completes without taking credit—
all things find their due,
yet some also find regret.
And yet, what Laozi says—
*"Heaven and Earth are not virtuous/ren,
treating all things as grass-dogs."*
*"The sage is not virtuous/ren,
treating the people as grass-dogs."*
How could his words be far from this?

Later students cling to narrow virtue/ren,
forgetting the ancients’ grand Dao—
thus, in serving others, they fail at universal love,
in cultivating themselves, they fail at selflessness—
how could they know the sage neither loses himself nor others?

Shifting with the times,
turning with all things—
within Heaven and Earth, is it not like the bellows and keys?
Thus, the more it moves, the more it emerges—
the upright self, without ego,
is how the sage responds to things,
not by opposing them.
The empty, unyielding—
the selfless, who lose themselves,
are how they sever things,
not how they perfect them.

Alas! The sage’s Dao of Heaven and Earth,
of treating the people and all things as grass-dogs,
can be exhausted in one phrase.

Liu Ji said:
*"Heaven and Earth’s lack of virtue/ren is no greater than holding fast to the Center."*
Heaven and Earth, in their relation to all things,
the sage, in his relation to the people,
follow their natural course,
entrust them to their own fate—
without love or gain,
thus called not virtuous/ren.
It is like binding grass to make a dog,
used in sacrifice—
when fit, it is employed;
when past, it is cast aside—
no lingering attachment.
The empty, awaiting things.

The Great Emptiness moves with one *qi*,
making Heaven and Earth like the bellows and keys.
The bellows—*wǔ* (a leather bag),
beaten to kindle fire.
The keys—*diào* (a reed pipe),
blown to produce sound.
Their substance is empty yet unyielding,
their function moves yet emerges evermore.
What difference is there from
Heaven’s motion as yang,
Earth’s stillness as yin,
the ceaseless striking of yin and yang,
while creation unfolds between?

Man’s form follows Heaven and Earth’s symbols,
his transformations align with yin and yang—
like the bellows and keys as instruments.
This speaks of Heaven and Earth,
yet man is within them.
Heaven and Earth grasp the marvel of one *qi*,
and move without ceasing.
The sage grasps the marvel of one *qi*,
and ascends and descends without end.
Its Dao is vast and distant,
hard to speak of.
If one seeks it in excessive words,
then it is mired in ancient dross,
and spirit is wasted in shallow depths—
not merely unprofitable.
Thus, excessive speech leads to exhaustion,
better to hold fast to the Center.
Holding fast to the Center—
within, it preserves;
without, it does not sway.
Without thought, without action,
serene and unmoving,
yet it guards the Center,
like Heaven and Earth’s bellows and keys—
without heart,
naturally moving and functioning,
for the True Lord abides within.
The True Lord—
Heaven’s grain, the original spirit.
Thus, it is followed by the spirit of the grain.
Zhao Shi’an said:
*"The two precedents—
First, Heaven’s utmost fairness."*

Heaven and Earth are not kind,
treating all things as sacrificial dogs.
Blending the singular nature into the Great Unity,
who is kind and who is not?
With private affection toward things,
there arises righteousness and unrighteousness.
Kindness gives birth to righteousness,
while ruthlessness brings death—
rooted in the natural course of Heaven’s operation.
When favor is bestowed, harm follows,
seen in the reversals of human affairs.
The Classics speak of "not-kindness,"
yet this is the greatest kindness.
Great kindness knows no private gain,
reaching only the utmost fairness.

When it is time to give life, life begins—
the Yang warmth that first animates things.
When it is time to take life, death comes—
the Metal *qi* stern and unyielding.
To say that the appointed time for death cannot be delayed
is to acknowledge the fixed fate of life and death.
When shaken, all things awaken;
when met with harmony, their uses decay—
though life is granted, decay soon follows,
though death is decreed, life’s intent persists.
This is Heaven’s fairness—
no more, no less.

But if one kills when it is time to give life,
or spares when it is time to take it—
this is not the public operation of Heaven’s Way,
but the private affection of human contrivance.
To harm the public with private gain is the upright order of Heaven and Earth;
to damage the public for private ends is the way of depravity and excess.
The Dao acts with fairness,
hence the saying that Heaven and Earth are not kind,
yet are likened to sacrificial dogs—
and thus Heaven’s intent is revealed.

Therefore, the sage’s governance
embodies Heaven and follows the Dao,
severing private kindness and righteousness,
upholding just rewards and punishments,
establishing what is proper—
what need for personal inclination?
The commentary states:
*"Favor arises from harm, harm from favor.
Kindness as favor—harm follows.
All this is to sever private affection."*

Thus, the sage is not kind,
treating the people as sacrificial dogs.
So that later sages may align with the Dao,
responding to change without obstruction.
Zhuangzi said, *"Constant kindness never succeeds,"*
and again, *"Do not heap up favors."*
Laozi equated Heaven and Earth’s kindness with the Dao—
the Dao is vast, so it knows no private gain,
and thus transcends the limited kindness of the Five Constants.
This intent points to the world’s petty kindness and righteousness.
Otherwise, why say that excessive speech leads to exhaustion,
better to hold fast to the Center?

Thus, the likeness of sacrificial dogs
illustrates how the sage’s use of "not-kindness" is true kindness.
To embody the kindness of "not-kindness"
is to embody Heaven and align with the Dao.

**Second Precept:**
The sage embodies Heaven.
The sage is not kind,
treating the people as sacrificial dogs.
The sage’s governance of the people
is without private intent,
in harmony with Heaven and Earth.

**Second Analogy:**
One, drawing from the essence of embodiment.

The space between Heaven and Earth—
it is like the *tǔnuò* [leather bellows].*
The *Gùzhù* [Commentary] says:
The *tǔnuò* receives through its emptiness,
and responds through its emptiness.

Indeed, the Dao is empty in its essence,
and void in its function.
When viewed through the Dao’s essence,
emptiness allows for boundless response;
when viewed through *lǐ* [principle/pattern],
voidness enables the measureless flow of *qi*.

The Dao responds through supreme voidness—
its origins are unknown;
The sage acts without contrivance—
who can fathom its purpose?

Between Heaven and Earth,
neither above nor below,
it employs *qi* within,
like the *tǔnuò*’s movement.

**Second Analogy:**
The function of the *tǔnuò*—
empty yet unyielding,
moving yet ever issuing forth.

The *Lǐzǐ* [Analects of Master Li] says:
"Why do you esteem emptiness?"

Emptiness has no worth in itself,
yet if emptiness is esteemed,
it becomes obstructed within.
If emptiness is merely emptiness,
it is not a worth to be esteemed.

Yet emptiness’s worth lies
in its ceaseless response—
viewed through the *tǔnuò*,
emptiness is thus esteemed.

Though viewed through the *tǔnuò*,
emptiness is not worth itself.

The sage acts without contrivance—
when things arise, he responds,
responding yet never exhausted.

All that is fitting yet unerring,
we call it *guījǔ* [rule/criterion],
and thus accord with it as *guījǔ*.
We call it *quánhéng* [balance/weights],
and thus accord with it as *quánhéng*.

Who can name its self-possession?
Even so,
when governing emperors and kings,
embodying the Dao is his mind—
in affairs, he is called "without contrivance";
in things, he is called "without possession."
How does this differ from *lǐ* [rites] and *yì* [justice], laws and measures?

Yet those who cling to *lǐ* and *yì*, laws and measures,
do I not also name them?
They name themselves in their own accord—
I do not bend to such naming.

What issues forth yet ever issues more,
what responds yet ever multiplies—
this is the supreme principle preserved.

Excessive speech leads to exhaustion,
better to hold fast to the Center.

This passage, from the Dao’s emptiness as function,
to the *tǔnuò*’s void response,
ends again with "Excessive speech leads to exhaustion,
better to hold fast to the Center"—
compared to the previous chapter,
it still regards speech as the Center.

Laozi likens the *tǔnuò* to the sage’s silence—
when speech is pressed, it moves;
when stirred, it responds—
because he acts without contrivance.

The *Yì* [Book of Changes] says:
"Speech and action are the pivot and hinge of the *jūnzǐ* [noble/gentleman]."
The pivot and hinge’s operation
determines honor and shame.
Yet it is merely fitting and appropriate.

The Center’s adherence is without fault—
not merely without fault but with method.
Confucius said:
"Moderation as *virtue/power* is indeed so—
thus speech must not be reckless."

Jūn Píng said:
"When words are spoken, calamity enters;
when words are lost, the body perishes."
Hán Zǐ said:
"Be cautious with water and fire as well."
The Dao is originally without speech—
when speech is unavoidable,
response must be measured.

If one desires speech,
how can it be avoided?
Thus, thrice he seals his mouth.
The sage thus demonstrates his form—
students seek the sage’s intent.

Shào Ruòyú said:
"Heaven and Earth’s *not-kindness* is supreme,
yet still not as good as adhering to the Center."

Heaven and Earth follow the Dao’s natural course—
this is called supreme *kindness*.
If not supreme *kindness*,
then there is partiality—
spring’s birth is not *kindness*,
autumn’s killing is not *not-kindness*.

The *tǐ* [sacrificial vessels] are discarded when their use is done,
treating all things as sacrificial dogs.

The sage holds *one mind* as *virtue/power*—
thus he takes the people’s mind as his own.
Rewarding the good is not *kindness*,
punishing the evil is not *not-kindness*.

Following the people’s needs,
rewarding and punishing according to the times—
thus the analogy of treating the people as sacrificial dogs.

Zhuāngzi said:
"Supreme *kindness* knows no partiality,
great *kindness* is *not-kindness*."

Only *not-kindness* is called great *kindness*.

Between Heaven and Earth—
meaning the four directions and above and below—
it is like the *tǔnuò*.

The *tǔnuò* is hollow within,
its function lies in the void,
yet it does not bend.

Discarding it to inflate the wind,
using the *nuò* [valve] to direct the breath—
moving yet ever issuing forth,
like the opening and closing of *Qiánkūn* [Heaven and Earth].

Laozi prefers "Excessive speech leads to exhaustion,
better to hold fast to the Center."
The Center is voidness—
dwelling in the mind within voidness,
its function is endless.

Wáng Zhìrán said:
"Heaven and Earth’s *not-kindness* is supreme,
yet still not as good as adhering to the Center."

The Great Dao acts without contrivance in Heaven and Earth,
yet Heaven and Earth depend upon it before they arise.
Heaven and Earth act without contrivance toward all things,
yet all things also depend upon it before they stir.
Only after Heaven and Earth arise
do all things exist—
and among all things,
humans are the most refined,
yet none fail to receive their natural endowment.
Initially, there is no mind of love or gain—
if *kindness* is considered favor,
is it not too small?

Heaven and Earth have no *emotion*—
they regard all things as sacrificial dogs.
Yet Heaven and Earth never demand repayment from all things,
nor do all things know
the favor of Heaven and Earth’s ceaseless generation—
great favor arises naturally.

The sage has no *emotion*,
yet he never demands repayment from the people,
nor do the people know
the power of the sovereign’s influence—
great transformation is thus accomplished.

Heaven and Earth toward all things,
the sage toward the people—
yet their natural order is self-formed,
where is room for contrivance?

Pursuing without end,
everyday use unknown—
where is the place for *kindness*?

Moreover, sacrificial dogs,
though pure and unsoiled,
are used in sacrifices—
when their use is at its height,
they are like the *táixì* [victim] in the grand temple,
adorned with embroidered robes,
treated with reverence as if divine,
yet without private favor or demand.
Once their use is done,
they are equal to dung and soil—
yet this is not from neglect or abandonment.
The haste between use and discarding—
is this not the sage’s contrivance?

Thus, Heaven, Earth, and the sage
regard themselves as sacrificial dogs—
then their view of all things and the people
is likewise without distinction.

Inflating the primordial *qi*,
stirring all existence—
like the *tǔnuò*, like the *nuò*—
pressed, then it moves;
stirred, then it responds.
Empty yet unyielding,
moving yet ever issuing forth—
the analogy is as the Dao’s response to things,
endless variations without end.

The interplay of transformations—
also like humans’ *emotions*.

The person expands the Dao/Way,
not the Dao/Way expanding the person.
The sage’s words are not confined by rhetoric—
when words suffice, the Dao/Way is exhausted in a day;
when words do not suffice, one may speak all day yet exhaust only things.
Eloquent discourse may pierce through,
silence embraces supreme truths—
yet if insight is shallow,
words fail to illuminate the Dao/Way,
the more one speaks, the further one strays from it.

Must there be a tongue of benevolent grace,
a mouth that pours forth rivers of speech,
when examined by great principle—
what true merit is there?
Better to remain silent yet deeply comprehend,
constructing wisdom in stillness.

Thus it is said:
Nine truths in ten words,
are not as good as one silence;
many words often fail,
better to uphold the central truth.

Huang Maozai remarked:
Heaven and Earth lack virtue/power until they treat the people as sacrificial dogs.
Heaven and Earth, toward all things,
do no harm—only let them follow their nature.
The sage, toward the people,
does no disturbance—only lets them flourish naturally.
Letting them flourish naturally,
so the people have no failing to thrive;
letting them follow their nature,
so things have no failing to fulfill.
This is their virtue/power most profound.

When they let things be as they are,
as if without concern or affection,
thus Heaven and Earth and the sage are said to lack virtue/power.
Like the sacrificial dogs—
using straw as dogs,
offered in sacrifice,
discarded once spent—
what concern or affection remains?
The doctrines of Shen Buhai and Han Fei
thus stole this to become the *criminal nomenclature*[*xíngmíng*], most cruel in their severity.

When questioned,
they say: "The sage’s governance of the world
has no concern or affection."
Their reasoning stems from this.

Has this not strayed from Laozi’s intent?

Between Heaven and Earth, nothing surpasses the virtue/power of *guard-the-center*[*shǒuzhōng*].

Heaven occupies the upper position, Earth the lower—this all people know.
The secret interplay of yin and yang, the hidden shifts of creation—this no one can know.

Now, let us liken it to the *bellies*[*tuó*] and *tubes*[*yuè*]: the Dao of Heaven and Earth is nearly contained in *wuwei*[*non-action*].

Empty and void in essence, thus it does not bend;
Ever-moving without cessation, thus it ever emerges anew.

Laozi’s Dao has no inner or outer—
to awaken to the *sacrificial-dog* teaching, one may forget the form and body;
to grasp the principle of *bellies* and *tubes*, one may refine *jing* and *qi*.

This should be self-evident without words—
speak of it, and one will exhaust its meaning.
Only *guard-the-center* attains it.

Program Tai said: Heaven and Earth are without virtue/power, treating all things as *sacrificial dogs*.
Binding straw into a dog’s shape—
when used in sacrifice, it is honored; once the rite is done, it is cast aside.
This is how things may be noble or base at different times.

Heaven and Earth generate and transform all things,
yet they cyclically replace one another—
truly like the *sacrificial dog*.

When rice ripens, wheat withers;
when melons grow, the *qí* plant dies;
when deer shed their antlers, spring and winter reverse.
Geese and swallows depart as guests—
south and north, they avoid one another.

Among all creatures, their inherent natures differ vastly—
thus what suits one may not suit another.
If one governs universally,
and yet harbors a heart of *virtue/power*,
then whom shall one favor?

To benefit one is to harm another,
to profit one is to neglect a hundred—
such *virtue/power* is laborious and petty.

If one aligns with the *qi* of things,
and acts when their roots and natures align,
then they arise and transform themselves,
take form and color themselves,
consume and rest themselves—
while Heaven and Earth seem to take no part in it.

This is *virtue/power* without *virtue/power*.
The sage is without *virtue/power*,
treating the people as *sacrificial dogs*.
The sage acts without intent,
yet employs the *Great Rectification* to model Heaven and Earth.

Thus, though never curving to love one person,
no one fails to receive their virtue/power.

Zhuangzi extended this, saying:
*"The most virtuous has no favorites—*
*let me forget the world,*
*and the world will forget me.*
This is the *true non-seven*[*zhēngbùqī*] virtue/power."

Though its blessings cover all,
the world does not know its virtue/power—
this is not true forgetting.

He also said:
*"The sage’s love for people—*
*if you name it for them,*
*they will not know it as love unless told."*

This too spreads blessings across ages,
yet the sage does not know it as *virtue/power*.
This is called *virtue/power* without *virtue/power*.

If one selects things to love,
and extends kindness only to those within one’s favor—
this is like a tiger or wolf
that does not devour its own young.

*Virtue/power* without *virtue/power*
is not its true essence.

Mencius said:
*"Kill them, and they bear no grudge;
benefit them, and they do not repay.*
The people daily improve and distance themselves from fault,
yet do not know who acts for them—
this is the method of their governance.
To say that plowing, digging, play, and leisure
are not the Emperor’s doing—
this is how their effects manifest."*

Between Heaven and Earth, movement is endless and ever emerges anew.

*Tuó* means to regulate *yuè*[*leather bellows*];
*yuè* is its tube.
In music, it is the *羽钥*[*yǔyuè*];
in locks, it is the *管钥*[*guǎnyuè*];
in foundry tools, it is the *橐钥*[*tuóyuè*];
yet in essence, it is but one.

*Tuó* is the belly that draws in breath and fills it,
then disperses it into the furnace.
*Yuè* is the tube that receives this breath
and exhales it to disperse it.

The pattern of one exhale and one inhale
is the alternating movement of yin and yang as the four seasons.

Thus, between Heaven and Earth,
cold and heat succeed one another as the four seasons,
life and death replace each other as the ages pass—
just as the *tuóyuè* exhales and inhales.

Jia Yi matched the creation of yin, yang, and all things
to the casting of metal—
his meaning stems from this.

The alternating exhale and inhale
are the mutual urging of *action* and *return*.
The wondrous must decay into rot,
and rot must return to the wondrous—
this is how things may be noble or base at different times.

To say that between Heaven and Earth is like the *tuóyuè*
means that all things shaped between the two
are formed by its inhaling and exhaling,
its expansion and contraction.

Zhuangzi’s discourse on things begins:
*"Yin and yang intermingle to form harmony, and thus things arise.
Ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness—
one dark, one bright—
daily changing, monthly transforming,
ever acting yet unseen in its function,
beginning and ending in life and death,
contrasting yet endless, unknown in its extremity."*

Yin and yang intermingle, and all things draw life from it—
this is the origin of things.
*Action* and *return* are the progression of generation and transformation.
Ebb and flow, full and empty—
yin and yang in motion, governing the inhale and exhale of the *tuóyuè*.
Change and transformation, life and death—
things alternately becoming *sacrificial dogs*.

Laozi borrowed the *tuóyuè* and *sacrificial dog* to speak of his principles;
Zhuangzi directly transmitted them in affairs.

Many words exhaust meaning—
better to *guard-the-center*.

All schools say this *center* is the *middle* of *Zhōngyōng*[*The Doctrine of the Mean*],
but Su Huangmen [*Su Xun*] disagrees:
*"This is the void of the *tuóyuè* dwelling in the center—*
his explanation is correct."*

Laozi sought to establish a singular doctrine,
and thus altered or replaced all the *Six Classics*’ terms for the Dao.

The *Six Classics* speak of *middle*—
Laozi called this *good*.
Yet he never spoke of *middle* in his own book.

Then what is this *middle*?
Like the *center* of a *domain*, an *archer’s bow*, or a *ring*—
naming a place within things,
not like the *middle* of *Zhōngyōng*,
which reaches the utmost and names its principle.

Thus, *guard-the-center*
refers specifically to the *center* of the *tuóyuè*,
to be held as its pivot—
like the *shū* [*pivot*] attaining the *center* of the *ring*,
to respond to the boundless.

Speakers first act and then name what they describe—
saying, *"This deed’s virtue/power is all my doing."*
Yet when applied to the world,
it may or may not be fitting,
may or may not align—
this cannot be certain.

「If one does not wait for the fitting moment but first gives form to words,
then those who conjecture and guess may occasionally hit upon the truth—
but those who conjecture and guess without hitting the mark are far more numerous,
and their efforts inevitably lead to exhaustion.

If one instead *guards-the-center*,
the response to sensation at first seems sluggish and dull,
yet in the end, it never falters or reaches exhaustion.
Thus it is said: *"It is better to guard-the-center."*

Discussing the space between heaven and earth is like speaking of *tuóyuè*—
its rise and fall all depend on the *succession* of the *Daode*’s *forging*.

The *Daode* is the one who wields *transformations*.
To allow oneself to be emptied and thus yield to the *Daode*’s manipulation,
one becomes the source of the ebb and flow of *yin* and *yang*—
for all things with form, emptiness brings fluidity,
fluidity allows for *inducing change*;
solidity brings stagnation,
stagnation leads only to inertness.

The *tuó*’s capacity to *absorb*,
the *yuè*’s capacity to *exhale*,
both arise from their emptiness.
Without the *tuó*’s emptiness, there would be no way to contain its *absorbing*;
without the *yuè*’s emptiness, there would be no way to effect its *exhaling*.
If the *tuóyuè* remains ever-empty,
it can receive the *eternal generation* of the *Daode* as its *rise*,
and receive the *transformations* of the *Daode* as its *fall*—
this is like borrowing the hollow space within the *tuóyuè*
to illustrate that what is not stagnant can still receive.

Only because it is not stagnant
does the *spreading qi* find a way to enter it.
The *Daode*’s *mechanism* is triggered by movement,
and it is *stirred* to *rise*—
this is its ability to manipulate *generation* and *transformation*.
Because it remains empty yet unyielding,
it can receive what is present
and manifest it in the world.

The *yin* and *yang qi* hides within the *Great Emptiness*,
yet takes form in sensation.
When sensation responds,
it can bring forth the *non-existent* as the *existent*.

The *tuóyuè* is not the *Great Emptiness*—
its emptiness allows for reception,
its reception does not cling—
it mirrors the *symbol* of all things entering and exiting the *mechanism*,
so this *mechanism* never ceases,
and *rise* and *fall* are endless.

Thus, the one who remains *still* and *unmoving*
is able to respond to sensation and thereby attain fluidity.

Discussing the marvel of the *tuóyuè*
is nearly akin to the *Gu shén*—
yet it cannot be fully aligned with it.
The *Gu shén* can *self-regulate* existence and non-existence,
while the *tuóyuè*’s *exhaling* and *absorbing*
still depend on the *Daode*’s *transformation*.
When *stirred* to *exhale*,
it differs from *self-receiving* and *self-responding*—
thus this chapter speaks of the *tuóyuè*,
and the next chapter turns to the *Gu shén*.

**Zhān Qiūpǔ** said:
*"Heaven and earth’s lack of virtue/power is as extreme as guarding-the-center.*
The *Daode*’s *non-attachment* chapter states that heaven and earth do not act from partiality or favor as virtue/power,
but treat all things as *fuel-for-sacrifice*—
the wise do not act from partiality or favor as virtue/power,
but treat the people as *fuel-for-sacrifice*.

*Fuel-for-sacrifice* is sufficient to feed horses and cattle,
and dogs are sufficient to guard homes—
these are all useful things,
relied upon by people for their needs.
The space between heaven and earth is like the *tuóyuè*—
its hollow center can *fan* and stir to generate *wind*,
yet though it is hollow, it does not bend or break.
This is the marvel of *non-attachment*—
when *fanning wind*, the more one moves, the more it exhales,
its marvel is beyond naming—
yet it is not as profound as steadfastly *guarding-the-center*,
which allows for boundless use.

**Zhāng Chōngyìng** replied:
*"Heaven and earth’s lack of virtue/power is as extreme as guarding-the-center.*
The virtue/power of the *Dao* is vast and boundless,
beyond any form or description—
thus Confucius rarely spoke of it,
and Laozi did not claim it as his own.
Rarely speaking means that it cannot be described in words,
and not claiming it means that it cannot be described yet he does not dwell on it either.
Heaven and earth do not claim virtue/power as their own,
thus they can *cover* and *encompass*—
all things generate and grow within them,
yet they do not know how they come to be.
The sage does not claim virtue/power as their own,
thus they can *include* and *contain*—
the people thrive and rest within them,
yet they do not know how they come to thrive.
All is seen as *fuel-for-sacrifice*—
loved and nurtured,
yet never cherished or held dear,
for fear of harm or decay—
the heart remains unperturbed, without attachment.

The reason heaven and earth lack virtue/power,
the reason the sage lacks virtue/power,
is that they follow the *single principle* of *qi* as it flows endlessly above and below—
like the *tuóyuè*’s capacity to *enclose*,
or the *yuè*’s capacity to *blow*—
circulating without end,
encompassing without limit—
though empty, it is never exhausted when *blown*,
though vast, it is never diminished when *stirred*—
the virtue/power of the *Dao* is boundless like this.
Thus Confucius said:
*"What words does heaven have?*
The *Four Seasons* move in their course."
Then the heart of heaven and earth, of all things,
has no voice within it.

If one desires to learn the *Dao*,
to embody the *transformations* of heaven and earth,
and yet still clings to words,
their tongue will tire,
their spirit will be disordered,
their essence will be depleted,
and their *qi* will falter—
all will reach exhaustion.

Thus it is said: *"It is better to guard-the-center."*
One should *guard* this *square-inch* [of the heart],
and *spread virtue/power* among things,
yet not reveal its traces.

**Bái Yùchán** said:
*"Heaven and earth lack virtue/power—*
they have no *heart* and treat all things as *fuel-for-sacrifice*,
letting them be as they are.
The sage lacks virtue/power—
they take heaven and earth’s *heart* as their own,
and treat the people as *fuel-for-sacrifice*,
yet still *forget-the-self*—
what else could there be?

The space between heaven and earth is the *heart*—
is it like the *tuóyuè*?
It flows without ceasing,
empty yet unyielding,
its use is endless.
When *stirred*, it exhales ever more,
pure and unchanging.
How can it be spoken of?
It is better to *guard-the-center*,
to exhaust what lies within us.

**Liào Cuìrán** said:
*"Heaven and earth lack virtue/power—*
they originate from humanity,
yet if one *returns* to their *root*,
treating all things as *fuel-for-sacrifice*,
then one should regard all things as *unconscious objects*—
in humanity, one must also *overcome-the-self* in this way.
The sage lacks virtue/power—
humanity’s ruler is also rooted in virtue/power,
yet by *returning* to their *root* and *restoring* to the *origin*,
treating the people as *fuel-for-sacrifice*—
one should abandon all the people as *useless objects*,
as in humanity, one must also *revert to ritual*."」

The space between Heaven and Earth,
within its embrace—
like the bellows and flute, is it not?

To Heaven and Earth, it is vast emptiness.
To my body, it is a stinking sack.
Empty yet unyielding,
when released, it fills the six directions,
when gathered, it does not overflow a single fistful.
Stirred, it exhales ever more—
*original qi* surging forth,
endless and unceasing.

Too much speech leads to exhaustion,
better to align with silence,
to seal the lips like a bottle.
It is better to *guard-the-center*,
to embrace the *original* and uphold the *One*,
endless and boundless.

If humanity acts thus,
the *Dao-qi* will be preserved.

**Chén Bìxū** said:
*"Heaven and Earth lack virtue/power*
until they treat the people as *fuel-for-sacrifice*—
*Sū* (草), the grass.
To bind the grass as a dog,
ancient rites used it for sacrifice,
to dispel omens of ill fortune,
and cast it aside once used—
in ordinary times, they did not cherish it,
yet when cast aside, they did not hate it either.
Thus, *fuel-for-sacrifice* is formed by divine intelligence,
yet divine intelligence has no use for it.

Without use, there is no partiality;
without partiality, there is no favor.
Therefore, Heaven and Earth, though lacking in favor,
generate great favor;
the sage, though not virtuous,
achieves great virtue.

To lack virtue/power—
it means no attachment to love,
not that they scorn what is evil.

Thus, Heaven and Earth, without attachment,
regard all things as *fuel-for-sacrifice*,
demanding no return from the myriad creatures.
The sage, without attachment,
regards the people as *fuel-for-sacrifice*,
demanding no return from the people.
This is the natural way of Heaven and Earth.

**Yán Jūnping** said:
*"Heaven is high and clear,
Earth is thick and tranquil.
Yin and Yang intermingle,
harmonious *qi* flows unceasing,
yet effortlessly, all things arise naturally.
Heaven and Earth do not strain their hearts,
move their intentions,
exhaust their spirits,
or labor over affairs—
no anxious care,
no lavish love,
no spreading of favor,
no granting of benefits—
yet all things are fulfilled.
This is what is meant by
*Heaven and Earth lack virtue/power,
treating all things as fuel-for-sacrifice*.

The enlightened king and sage
uphold the *Dao-qi* in harmony,
clear and unchanging,
transforming through the *One*,
divine intelligence silently guiding,
conforming to the *Dao*'s rites,
the world responding,
all things transforming naturally.
The sage does not exhaust wisdom,
deplete ability,
disturb the heart,
or strain the mind—
no ceasing of thought,
no restless wandering,
no grasping of human affairs,
no leading of the people—
yet all is fulfilled.
This is what is meant by
*the sage lacks virtue/power,
treating the people as fuel-for-sacrifice*.

The space between Heaven and Earth is stirred yet ever more exhales—
The bellows (*tuó*) holds the wind,
flute (*yuè*) emits the sound.
Like the bellows blowing wind to kindle fire,
or the flute releasing notes to tune the music,
its application is endless,
yet it can never be bent.
Thus, the sage—
without partiality, without attachment—
does not engage in love or gain.

**Yán Jūnping** further said:
*"If Heaven and Earth abandon emptiness
and engage in love and gain,
then transformation will falter,
and things will not fully arise.
If the sage abandons emptiness
and engages in love and gain,
then virtue and grace will not be universal,
the realm will not be at peace,
favor will not reach the depths,
and affairs will not be fully accomplished.
Why so?
For the art of love demands measure,
yet the myriad things aspire to boundless transformation.
To wield measured gain
and bestow it upon boundless potential—
its failure is as certain as a dried riverbed,
and to aid it is to weep in vain.

Again he said:
Lice and fleas move upon the hair,
yet sleep is disturbed by them;
mosquitoes and flies settle on the skin,
yet the spirit is agitated,
thoughts stifled.
External harm from wasp and scorpion venom
poisons the core within,
while unseen damage to ears and eyes
leaves all limbs paralyzed.
This shows that love and gain,
when harbored in the chest,
cannot but yield to strain,
impurity, and depletion of blood and *qi*.

Too much speech leads to exhaustion,
better to align with silence.
Too much speech—
it means excessive words of universal love.
Excessive words make biased action difficult,
and thus exhaustion comes,
bending yet never succeeding.
If one follows Heaven and Earth’s emptiness and tranquility,
and the bellows and flute’s heartlessness,
embracing and upholding the *center’s harmony*,
then its natural sufficiency will be enough.
It also lies in the teaching of *non-speech*.
*The Honglie Jie* says:
*Wáng Shòu* carried books as he walked,
and met *Xú Féng* in Zhou.
*Xú Féng* said:
*‘Affairs arise from responding to change,
and change is born of time,
so one who knows time has no fixed action.
Books are the source of speech,
and speech comes from knowledge.
Knowledge keeps the books hidden.’*
Thus, *Wáng Shòu* burned his books
and danced, saying:
*‘Too much speech leads to exhaustion,
better to align with silence.’*

**Xiè Túnán** said:
*"Heaven and Earth lack virtue/power*
until they treat the people as *fuel-for-sacrifice*.
All things receive Heaven and Earth’s *qi* to arise,
the people receive the sage’s grace to flourish—
to say they lack virtue/power is impossible.
Yet rise and fall, success and failure,
are entrusted to natural forces,
and life and death, calamity and fortune,
are summoned by humanity alone.
Heaven and Earth, the sage—
in this, they have no attachment at all.
To say they lack virtue/power
is not to say they lack it.
It is that they cannot wield their virtue/power in action.
*Fuel-for-sacrifice*—
it is the remnant after sacrifice,
left to its own formation and decay,
with no further thought given to it.
The space between Heaven and Earth—
its principle for all things is natural and effortless,
thus the two *qi* of Yin and Yang
flow through the void without obstruction,
like the bellows and flute.
The bellows has no bottom,
the flute has holes.
The bellows’ emptiness allows *qi* to circulate,
unbending, unbroken;
the flute’s holes let sound resonate,
ever more exhale, never cease.
All this is natural and effortless.
Things and humanity within Heaven and Earth—
their beginning and end, their transformation—
are also natural and effortless.
Thus, too much speech leads to repeated exhaustion,
and cannot be fully accomplished,
better to uphold the *One*’s central principle."*

The principle reaches its apex in *zhōng* and stops there.
Heaven and Earth, sages, common folk, all things under Heaven—
none exist beyond this *zhōng*.

Now let us examine this:
All things and all people share this same *qi*.
All beings between Heaven and Earth share this same mind.

What is Heaven’s mind?
To nurture life is its mind.
What is the sage’s mind?
To love the people is its mind.

Yet at the beginning, when life first arises,
it cannot but change by its end.
At the start, when love is given,
it cannot but differ later.

Why?
Heaven’s way establishes Yin and Yang,
humanity’s way establishes *rén* and *yì*.
Life emerges—this is Yang—
yet it cannot lack the solemn and killing Yin.
Nurturing is *rén*—
yet it cannot lack the cutting and restraining *yì*.
This is the natural course of things.

Even a humble *chúgǒu*—a minor thing—
yet when it is nurtured for sacrifice,
one fears its integrity may be incomplete.
But once the sacrifice is done,
it is cast aside as useless,
crushed and broken—
none can escape this fate.

All beings in Heaven and Earth
share the same original endowment,
and all life is worthy of love.
Yet once formed, they scatter and differ—
some are cultivated, some are toppled,
some are blessed, some are doomed,
each following its own portion.

At this time,
Heaven and Earth’s nurturing virtue,
the sage’s loving care—
there are aspects that cannot be fully preserved.
To call this *not-rén* is to say
one cannot exhaust one’s *rén*.

Heaven and Earth use the *zhōng*’s emptiness—
like the bellows and flute—to nurture all things.
The sage uses the *zhōng*’s path
to respond and reciprocate with the people.

Thus, in one word, it is said:
*"Better to uphold the *zhōng*."*

What is this *zhōng*?
Is it the utmost impartiality, without favor?
Is it the avoidance of excess or deficiency?

Lin Yōngzhāi said:
*"Heaven and Earth’s lack of *rén* is why one must uphold the *zhōng*."*

Nurturing life—this is *rén*.
Yet Heaven and Earth, though they nurture life,
do not claim it as merit,
forgetting themselves with all things.

Nurturing the people—this is *rén*.
Yet the sage, though nurturing the people,
does not claim it as favor,
forgetting themselves with the people.

*Not-rén* means not possessing one’s own *rén*.
The *chúgǒu*, once used and discarded,
is an illustration of mutual forgetting.

Chapter Thirty-Eight says:
*"The sage’s highest virtue is without virtue,
thus it has virtue."*

*Not-rén* is like *not-de*.
In *Zhuangzi’s* *"Qíwù"*:
*"Great *rén* is not *rén*."*
In *"Tiāndì"*:
*"In the age of perfect virtue,
they love one another without knowing it as *rén*."*

This is the same meaning.

The *chúgǒu*—
when used in sacrifice, it is honored;
once the sacrifice is done, it is cast aside—
an illustration of not dwelling on it,
of mutual forgetting.

Speaking precisely,
this implies the intent to transform what is excessive.
But if one takes this to mean
treating the people as grass and chaff,
that is mistaken.

The teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi delight in shocking the world and defying convention, hence their language often contains flaws.

This chapter’s core meaning is simply:
The Dao of Heaven and Earth does not harbor intent in nurturing life,
The sage does not harbor intent in nourishing the people.
Yet it speaks thus in strange metaphors,
and readers who lack precision fall into deep error.

Thus it is said that the harshness of Shen Buhai and Han Feizi
originates from the intent of treating the people as *chúgǒu*.
Even Laozi cannot evade blame for this.

The *kǒu* (口) is the tube of the *tuó* (橐).
When the *tuó* and *kǒu* are used, wind arises.
Though its body is hollow,
when applied, it does not bend—
movement generates wind,
the more it operates, the more it produces.

Between Heaven and Earth,
its nurturing of myriad things is likewise so.
The *tuó* and *kǒu* do not harbor intent in generating wind—
Heaven and Earth do not harbor intent in nurturing life.
Thus, this metaphor is used.
Moreover, when used, wind arises;
when unused, it ceases—
this too implies the intent of transforming excess.

*Shù* (数) means "repeatedly."
*Shǒu zhōng* (守中) means silently closing one’s mouth.
It means:
The Dao of Heaven and Earth cannot be fully expressed in words;
excessive speech repeatedly leads to exhaustion—
better to remain silent and forget words.

The Master said:
*"I wish to speak not at all."*
What speech can Heaven have?
The four seasons move within it,
myriad things are born within it.
This is the same meaning.

Yet the sage’s words are pure and easily understood,
while this text oscillates wildly, making it difficult to grasp.
Some may say it warns against excessive speech,
but this contradicts the chapter’s intent.

If one sees through this,
not only does the beginning and end cohere,
the meaning becomes clear,
but its language is also concise, profound, and ancient—
how could this be easily attained?

Fan Yingyuan said:
*"Heaven and Earth are without virtue, treating myriad things as *chúgǒu*.*
*Virtue* is the principle of love.
It is said that Heaven and Earth’s nurturing is vast,
yet they do not speak of virtue—
toward myriad things, it is like binding straw into a dog for sacrifice.
Before it is presented, it is carried in a wicker basket,
covered with embroidered cloth—
not out of love, but because of the occasion.
Once the sacrifice is complete,
passersby trample its head and back,
firewood gatherers take it for fuel—
not that they do not love it,
but because of the occasion.
Spring and summer nurture growth,
like the *chúgǏu* before presentation;
autumn and winter wither and fall,
like the *chúgǒu* after discard—
all is the work of the seasons.
How could it be that they love in spring and summer
but do not love in autumn and winter?
When *qi* arrives, myriad things act without knowing why—
the sage is without virtue, treating the people as *chúgǒu*.
The sage embodies this Dao to universally love,
his virtue is thus supreme.
Yet he does not speak of virtue—
toward the people, it is like Heaven and Earth toward myriad things:
aiding their natural unfolding without harm,
ensuring life and death proceed without regret,
so they do not know the Emperor’s power over them.

Between Heaven and Earth, the more it moves, the more it produces.
The bag is called *tuó*, the bamboo tube is called *kǒu*.
In smelting, the *kǒu* connects the *tuó* to channel *qi* and blow the furnace fire.
*Qū* (屈) means "bent."
*The Yīn Biàn* says: *"Yú"* (俞) is pronounced as *"yáng zhū"* (羊朱).
Fù Yì cites *Guang Yǎ*: *"Yú"* means "benefit."
The *Han Shǐ* records the people’s suffering and hardship as *"yú"* (俞).

Between Heaven and Earth, it is only empty and flowing—
like the bamboo tube channeling *qi*,
empty yet unbent—
when *qi* comes, it passes through;
when *qi* departs, it does not accumulate.
It is like the *tuó* wind:
the more it moves, the more it produces.
Once the furnace’s materials are refined into forms,
the *tuó* and *kǒu* never speak of virtue or love.

Excessive speech leads to exhaustion—
better to uphold the central emptiness of Heaven and Earth,
without deviation, so that myriad things naturally find their place.
How could there be exhaustion?

Xué Yǒngzhāi said:
*"Heaven and Earth are without virtue, treating the people as *chúgǒu*.*
Heaven and Earth nurture myriad things
yet harbor no intent toward them.
The sage nourishes the people
yet harbors no intent toward them.
Between Heaven and Earth, the more it moves, the more it produces.
The *tuó* and *kǒu* remain unobstructed in their emptiness,
thus the more they move, the more sound they produce.
Heaven and Earth’s ability to transform and nurture myriad things without exhaustion
lies in their emptiness and their ability to move.
Excessive speech leads to exhaustion—
better to uphold the central emptiness."

Huì Shī’s eloquence
is not as good as Yán Zhī’s silent cultivation.

Xiū Xiū’ān said:
*"Heaven and Earth are without virtue, treating the people as *chúgǒu*—*
*until it is better to uphold central emptiness.*
The *chúgǒu* is a straw dragon bound for sacrifice,
enclosed in a red lacquered case,
covered with embroidered cloth—
once the sacrifice ends, it is discarded.
Heaven and Earth, the sage—
they embody the marvel of *wuwei*,
nurturing myriad things without expecting gratitude,
not claiming ownership,
allowing things to transform naturally,
like the *chúgǒu*—
thus it seems as though they are without virtue.
Between Heaven and Earth, it is empty like a *tuó* bag,
*qi* flows and runs, nurturing myriad things.
A clear and empty mind is likewise so.
A spontaneous spark of insight,
endless wondrous application—
this is called empty yet unbending,
moving yet ever producing.
The *tuó* is the *tuó* bag,
the *kǒu* is the tube—
instruments for stirring wind and movement.
Though this metaphor illustrates the marvel of transformation,
excessive speech only distances one from the Dao.
Even with great eloquence and repeated analogies,
metaphors are limited in number,
while this Dao is beyond all metaphor—
better to remain silent.
The subtlety of upholding central emptiness
can reveal the penetration of transformation.

Chǔ Bóxiù said:
*"Heaven and Earth are without virtue, treating the people as *chúgǒu*—*
*until it is better to uphold central emptiness.*
*Virtue* is the concrete manifestation of the numinous Dao,
establishing the heart of Heaven and Earth,
continuing the mandate of the people—
like *yuan* (元) to *qián* (乾),
gathering all virtues and achieving completeness,
molding myriad kinds without omission.
In humans, this means perfecting oneself and others,
universal love and benevolent rescue—
all are its applications."*

Heaven and Earth possess natural virtue beyond speech and symbols.
The Sage embodies Heaven’s virtue and extends benevolence,
thus expanding the Imperial Dao and achieving governance.
Yet the text speaks of "not-ren" (不仁)—why?
It means their virtue is not displayed,
like *upper virtue* not being called virtue—
a paradoxical statement.
Using the analogy of bound straw shaped as a dog for sacrifice,
before sacrifice it is adorned with love and respect,
afterward discarded and trampled—
its creation and destruction are mere transformations,
not rooted in affection or aversion.
This reveals the true nature beneath illusion,
and the logic of things becomes clear.

All moving, growing, flying, and swimming beings,
their birth, flourishing, decline, and return,
are but the circulation of one *qi*,
flowing endlessly—
like bound straw becoming a dog,
then the dog returning to straw.
How could there be any intentionality here?

The Sage, regarding the people,
lets them pursue their affairs,
while the Dao naturally unfolds.
This is what Zhuangzi meant by *"great virtue is not-ren."*

Between Heaven and Earth, it is like the bellows and windbox.
This also speaks of its lack of intention.
The bellows and windbox, when activated,
blow air through the pipes—
like the circulation of *qi* in yin and yang,
breathing without pause.
All beings and things are cast in its molding.
Only when it remains centrally empty and unobstructed
does its movement of *qi* flow ever outward.
This principle harmonizes perfectly with the transformations of creation—
why speak further, only to exhaust oneself?
Better to uphold the bellows and windbox within oneself,
to explore the Heaven and Earth within,
for where is the logic of generating all things?

Some interpret the excessive words of the restless as an explanation,
but this does not align with the context above and below.
The core meaning of this passage lies in *"upholding centrality."*
The profound truth is so subtle and mysterious
that only scholars who practice diligently
can verify within themselves the presence of a Heaven and Earth—
for it exists within the human body alone.

**Niu Miaozhuan said:**
Heaven and Earth are not-ren,
treating all things as bound straw-dogs.
Yet the great virtue of Heaven and Earth is *generation*—
unceasing generation is called *ren*.
*Ren* is the virtue of Heaven and Earth’s creation.
Yet it says "not-ren"—
meaning Heaven and Earth do not possess virtue for themselves.
All things are the myriad kinds filling Heaven and Earth.
The bound straw-dog refers to ancient sage-kings’ sacrifices,
where straw was bound into dog-shaped offerings—
*Shu* (刍) being reeds or thatch.
Though reeds are humble, their use is weighty;
the dog, a domesticated beast,
holds the *xu* (戌) position and corresponds to *Qian* (乾).
Thus, ancient people shaped reeds into dogs for sacrifice,
symbolizing their reverence.
If Heaven and Earth treat all things as bound straw-dogs,
it is not that they hold them lightly.
Some argue that Heaven and Earth regard all things
as mindless straw and beasts,
expecting no reciprocation—
this reasoning is flawed.
All things share *qi* with Heaven and Earth in their origin,
only differing in the smallness of their form.
If Heaven and Earth truly viewed all things
as mere straw and beasts,
then they would be selfishly hoarding their own greatness—
would that not be *not-ren*?
This is my shallow understanding.
The enlightened will discern it.

The Sage is not-ren,
treating the people as bound straw-dogs.
The Sage is the complete embodiment of utility,
a teacher for all ages.
Thus, the people revere them like the sun and moon,
look up to them like parents.
Yet it is called "not-ren"—
not claiming virtue for oneself,
a humble and exalted stance,
as Confucius himself did not dwell on it.
The people are the common folk.
Though the Sage and the people share the same *qi*,
their noble or humble, prosperous or destitute fates differ.
If the Sage treats the people as bound straw-dogs,
it is not that they are held lightly.
Some say the Sage views the people
as mindless straw and beasts,
expecting no reciprocation—
this interpretation is likely mistaken.
Humans stand alongside Heaven and Earth,
the Three Powers in equilibrium—
how could they be compared to straw and beasts?
Mencius said:
*"If a ruler treats his ministers as hands and feet,
the ministers will treat the ruler as their heart.
If a ruler treats his ministers as dogs and horses,
the ministers will treat the ruler as a commoner.
If a ruler treats his ministers as dust and weeds,
the ministers will treat the ruler as an enemy."*
If the Sage truly regarded the people
as mere straw and beasts,
then the Sage would indeed be not-ren.
My fellow seekers,
I earnestly hope you will discern this truth.

Between Heaven and Earth,
the more movement, the more it emerges.

The bellows belong to the drum family.
The *piào* (笛) is a flute, of the pipe family.
*"Yóu"* (犹) means *"like."*

Movement means *use*.
Between Heaven and Earth, the void is empty,
yet it employs the Four Seasons and Five Phases.
The bellows and *piào* are instruments—
their emptiness is void,
employing the Five Tones and Six Pitches.
Thus it is said:
*"Between Heaven and Earth, it is like the bellows and *piào*."*

The Old Master (老君) said:
*"The bellows and *piào* are instruments,
their value lies in their use.
Empty yet full, present yet absent,
round yet square, vast yet minute,
long yet short, broad yet narrow—
they follow the player’s will,
yet do not compete for mastery.
Humans in the world—
are they not like the bellows and *piào*?
They do not contend with all things,
yet their virtue naturally returns.
This is because they are humble, empty, and without striving.
This truly speaks of Heaven and Earth’s virtue:
to receive all things in their void,
to let nature take its course,
to follow the people’s desires,
not to contend with things,
just as the bellows and *piào*
follow the player’s breath and notes."*

Too much speech leads to regret.
Speech is the voice of the heart.
In the heart, it is *intent* (志);
when expressed, it is speech.
*"Shù"* (数) means *frequent*;
*"qióng"* (穷) means *regret and loss*.
Too much speech means too many faults—
thus it is said: *"Too much speech leads to regret."*

The ancients said:
*"A single word can ruin a state—
this is the speech of the highest kind of fool.
A single word can bring disaster—
this is the speech of the middling fool.
A single word can bring shame—
this is the speech of the lowest fool."*

Thus Heaven has the *rolling-tongue star* (卷舌之星),
and humans have the *sealed-mouth inscription* (缄口之铭).
Speech cannot be taken lightly.
It is said:
*"The gentleman desires to be slow in speech yet quick in action."*
This is indeed correct.

In ancient times, Confucius observed the Zhou,
and entered the Temple of Houji (后稷).
On the right step stood a golden man,
his mouth sealed three times,
with an inscription on his back:
*"A man of caution in speech in ancient times.
Beware of excessive speech!"*
Avoid too much speech—
too much speech leads to failure.
Avoid too much action—
too much action leads to calamity.

The *Book of Poetry* (《诗》) says:
*"Revere your bearing,
be cautious in your words."*
This is what it means.

Better still is to *guard the Middle* (守中).
The *Middle* is the *pivot and mechanism* (枢机).
To *guard* means to be *vigilant* (谨).
Moreover, the sun and moon—
they are Heaven’s *ornaments* (文).
Mountains and rivers—
they are Earth’s *ornaments*.
Speech and language—
they are humanity’s *ornaments*.
Yet speech issues from the mouth,
like a blade held in check—
do not move it lightly.
It is like a drawn bowstring,
which may still be stopped,
but once the arrow leaves the string,
even if you wish to recall it,
you cannot.

The *Appendices to the Changes* (《系辞》) say:
*"Words issue from the self and affect the people;
actions arise nearby and are seen afar.
Speech and action—
the pivot and mechanism of the gentleman.
When the pivot and mechanism are set in motion,
honor and disgrace are determined.
Speech and action—
by which the gentleman moves Heaven and Earth.
Can they not be taken with caution?
This is the meaning of *better still is to guard the Middle*."*

The *Book of Changes* (《易》) says:
*"To bind the bag without blame or praise—
this is indeed caution, is it not?"*

Yang Zhìrén (杨智仁) said:
*"Heaven and Earth’s lack of virtue is the ultimate *guard the Middle* (守中).*
Heaven and Earth do not act with virtue,
yet they regard all things as *straw-dogs* (刍狗).
They bestow transformation without virtue or favor—
nature takes its course,
and they do not expect reciprocation.
The Sage is the same.
For those who study the Dao/Way,
do not cling to even a single hair of material desire.
If the Great Void (太虚) is calm and ever still,
and the *Three Powers* (三才) operate within it,
the *bellows and *piào* (橐钥) sound through the cosmos,
the Original Qi (元炁) ascends and descends in the Yellow Court (黄庭),
the *Kàn* (坎) and *Lí* (离) transform in their cycles,
the *Sè* (塞) and *Duì* (兑) hang their veils,
the *Hán* (含) and *Guāng* (光) remain silent—
empty yet never yielding,
guarding with *chōnghé* (冲和),
unmoved by trifles,
yet ever more active when moved—
this is the ancient saying:
*'Preserve the body, let go of all,
and not a single thought arises.'*
If one speaks too much and regrets it,
there is loss without gain—
far better is to *guard the Middle* for ages.
Refined and natural,
it blends into one piece.

The Confucianists say:
*'The Sage’s Dao/Way is nothing but virtue and righteousness, moderation and correctness.'*
Heaven, Earth, and the Sage regard all things as straw-dogs—
they do not cling to anything.
The gentleman is matched to Heaven and Earth—
is he not like the bellows and *piào*?
Empty yet never yielding,
active yet ever more so.
Most simple, most easy—
how difficult is it to know?
Thus, too much speech leads to regret,
and better is to *guard the Middle*."

The gentleman is *yellow-centered and harmonious* (黄中通理),
never losing his *correctness* (正).

In further analogy:
*"Heaven and Earth’s lack of virtue is the ultimate *guard the Middle*."*
What does Heaven speak?
The Four Seasons move,
and all things are born.
Heaven and Earth give birth to things
yet do not claim virtue for themselves—
they forget about things.
Unknowing yet unknowing,
they follow the *imperial norm* (帝则),
and the *imperial force* (帝力) has no hold on them.

The Sage nourishes the people
yet does not claim virtue for himself—
he forgets about the people.
*"Straw-dog"* (刍) is *straw*;
it symbolizes *bundled straw shaped like a dog*.
The *Zhuangzi* (《庄子》□*Tiān Rùn* [天运]篇) says:
*"Before the straw-dog is offered in sacrifice,
it is adorned with embroidered bags,
wrapped in silk and brocade.
After the sacrifice is complete,
passersby trample its head and back,
and woodcutters take it to fuel their fires.
It is honored before the sacrifice,
yet despised after the rites are done.
This is the analogy—
it embodies the intent of *transcending form and passing beyond transformation*."*

I have read Liu Zizhu’s (柳子) *Biography of Guo Tuótuo* (《郭橐驼传》),
and from cultivating trees,
I have learned the art of nurturing people.
Guo Tuótuo’s method of planting trees—
do not disturb it, do not fret over it;
once planted, leave it be.
When tending, treat it like a child;
when setting it down, treat it like discarding.
A father toward his child—
how often does he claim credit for his kindness?
His poetry is like a child:
born and raised,
yet he does not claim virtue for himself—
it is simply what he possesses.
If he errs and forgets his possession,
if he transforms and discards what he has placed,
it is like abandoning the straw-dog after sacrifice.
Between Heaven and Earth,
the bellows are struck, the *piào* is played—
one instrument alone.

*"Tuó"* (橐) means *leather bag*;
*"qiào"* (钥) means *pipe*—
the tool by which wind is drawn.
Empty within yet never yielding in use,
the more it is moved, the more it emerges;
the more it emerges, the more it has.
Its origin is boundless,
its issue endless.

The **virtue/power** of the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth and the Sage is also like this.

The **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth cannot be fully expressed in words,
yet its transformation through sound and color is the most trivial of human affairs.
Hence it is said:
*"Many words exhaust the limitless"*—
better to uphold the **center** (中).

Upholding the **center** (中),
silently yet naturally preserving itself.

The *Xū Liù Xū* (胥六虚) says:
*"Heaven and Earth’s lack of virtue/power is no greater than upholding the **center** (中)."*

The greatest **virtue/power** of Heaven and Earth is **generation** (生),
yet it treats all things as straw-dogs.
It covers and carries them,
but lets those that thrive grow of their own accord,
while those that wither perish on their own—
Heaven and Earth take no part in this.
This is how Heaven and Earth do not possess their **virtue/power** (仁),
yet treat all things as straw-dogs—
**virtue/power** (仁) is vast indeed.

The straw-dog’s purpose:
before sacrifice, it is honored and revered;
after sacrifice, it is cast aside—
not from a fickle heart,
but simply the nature of the moment.

Thus, the Sage uses it as an analogy.

The Sage embodies the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth,
nurtures the people,
broadens and forgives them,
letting those who flourish do so naturally,
those who grow do so of their own accord.
With tilling and weaving,
their families prosper and the nation is at peace,
yet the Sage takes no credit—
this too is how the Sage does not claim his **virtue/power** (仁),
yet treats the people as straw-dogs.

Between Heaven and Earth,
a single *qi* steams and molds,
all things **generate** and **transform** (生化),
unceasing from ancient times to the present.

It is like the bellows and pipe—
empty within yet boundless in use.
When struck and moved,
sound and *qi* flow forth ever more.
This praises the Sage’s **virtue/power** (德),
vast and limitless—
his **virtue/power** (仁) nourishes the people yet is not his own.

How so?
It is simply **emptiness** (虚).

Thus, in response to the movements of the world,
there is no end to his power.

If one does not grasp the **Dao/Way** (實) of Heaven and Earth’s **non-virtue/power** (不仁), but instead **discerningly** (察然) **seeks** (自好) what is pleasing,
hanging laws and enacting punishments,
adorned with elaborate words and phrases,
to guide the people toward **transformation** (從化),
he violates Heaven and contradicts **principle** (理),
invoking the wrath of the spirits and the resentment of the people.
Thus he hastens toward the **Dao/Way** of **exhaustion** (穷极),
and so I urge him: *"Excessive speech leads to **exhaustion** (穷),
better to hold fast to the **central** (中)."*

*"Excessive speech"* means to adorn with elaborate words and phrases—
many words, few principles—
better to grasp my **central** (中) and **silently** (默) **know** (識) and **practice** (行) it,
**conscientiously** (謹) **guarding** (守) it without loss,
so that the world observes the **wind** (風) and **transforms** (化).

Is there any **exhaustion** (穷) in **teaching without words** (不言之教)?
**Cultivating oneself** (修身) also follows this **Dao/Way** (法).

**Gai Yuan Gao** (柴元皋) said: *"Heaven and Earth are **non-virtue/power** (不仁)."*
They **benefit** (以美利) the world with their **virtue/power** (利) yet do not speak of their own **virtue/power** (利).
They treat all things as **straw-dogs** (刍狗).
**Straw** (刍), **reed** (茅) bound like dogs for sacrifice.
At first, when bound, it is **sincere and pure** (誠洁), **strict and solemn** (甚嚴),
but once the sacrifice is complete, it is cast aside without regard.

The **heart of creation** (造物之心) is likewise as the **straw-dog’s beginning and end** (刍狗之始終):
it follows **nature** (自然).

The **Sage is **non-virtue/power** (不仁)**.
The Sage **embodies** (體) Heaven and Earth,
yet does not speak of his own **virtue/power** (利).
He treats the people as **straw-dogs** (刍狗).
Only he fears that a single person might be **neglected in nourishment** (失養),
just as **strict** (謹) as the first binding of the **reed** (茅),
not daring to **overlook** (忽) even a **thread** (毫).

Between Heaven and Earth lies the **Dao/Way** of the **bellows and pipe** (橐鉤).
**Bellows** (橐), the **leather bag** (冶韛) for smithing.
**Pipe** (鉤), the **three-holed flute** (三孔笛).
Both are **empty within** (虚其中),
their **breath** (氣) **inhaled and exhaled** (一阖一辟).
The same applies to the human body’s **breathing** (呼吸).

The **nourishment of the people** (養民) occurs within a single **breath** (呼吸),
not like Heaven and Earth,
which might cause the people to **lose their place** (失所).
**Cultivating the body and its functions** (修體用) is likewise.
**Empty yet unyielding** (虚而不屈),
its **embodiment** (體) is **unobstructed** (無礙).
**Moved, yet ever more** (動而愈出),
its **function** (用) is **inexhaustible** (不穷).

Excessive speech leads to **exhaustion** (穷),
better to hold fast to the **central** (中).
If one **boasts of his own virtue** (矜其仁) and **prizes speech** (尚口),
then **exhaustion** (穷) is inevitable.
Who would prefer this
to **emptiness within, storing the spirit** (虚中存神),
**embodying** (體) Heaven and Earth?

**Su Jing Jing** (蘇敬靜) said: *"Heaven and Earth’s **non-virtue** (不仁) is best understood
as **holding fast to the central** (守中)."*
Binding **reed** (刍) into a **straw-dog** (狗),
it is used during sacrifice,
then cast aside afterward.
The **straw-dog’s purpose** (用) is **transformed** (化) by the occasion,
yet Heaven and Earth, though they **generate all things** (生万物),
do not **claim the virtue of doing so** (自以为仁).
The Sage, though he **nourishes all the people** (养万民),
also does not **claim the virtue of doing so** (自以为仁).
It is like the **straw-dog**—
when used for sacrifice, it is **employed** (用),
once the sacrifice is done, it is **cast aside** (弃).
**Transformation and decay** (過化) are **forgotten** (相忘),
how could they ever **claim the virtue of doing so** (自以为仁)?

**Bellows** (橐) are **leather bags** (冶韛) for smithing.
**Pipes** (鉤) are **flutes** (管) in music called **羽鉤** (羽钥),
**keys** (管) in locks called **管鉤** (管钥),
or **bellows** (橐鉤) in smithing—
all are **pipes** (管) in essence.
The **bellows** (橐) **absorbs** (吸) the **breath** (氣) when full,
**distributing** (播) it into the **smithing furnace** (冶炉).
The **pipe** (管) **receives** (受) this **absorption** (吸) and **exhales** (嘘) it,
thus **distributing** (播) it.
Within each **exhale and inhale** (嘘吸),
lies the **interplay of yin and yang** (阴阳) **cycling** (迭运) as the **four seasons** (四时),
the **mechanism of endless generation** (生生不穷之机).
When **yin and yang** (阴阳) **intermingle** (交), all things **draw sustenance for life** (资生).
**Ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness** (消息盈虚),
are the **movements of yin and yang** (阴阳之动),
governed by the **bellows and pipe’s exhale and inhale** (橐钥之嘘吸).
To **receive** (受) the **exhaled and inhaled breath** (嘘吸之气) in **emptiness** (虚),
yet **never bend or yield** (不屈).
**Bending** (屈) means **folding or breaking** (折).
The **exhaled and inhaled breath** (嘘吸之气),
when **moved**, **flows forth ever more** (愈出),
never seen to **waste or falter** (损折) and **cease** (息).
The **bellows** (橐) **absorbs** (能吸),
the **pipe** (钥) **exhales** (能嘘),
both through **emptiness** (虚).
If **blocked** (窒), then it is **filled** (实).
Only when **not blocked** (不窒),
does the **breath** (播气) find **entry** (入).

Heaven and Earth are a **great bellows** (大炉韛),
**Creation and Transformation** (造化) are a **great smith** (大冶工).
All things are **breath** (阴阳) **exhaled and inhaled** (嘘吸之气),
**self-generated** (自生) and **self-completed** (自遂),
**self-consumed** (自消) and **self-lengthened** (自长).
How could they ever **claim the virtue of doing so** (以为仁)?

Some may see the **function of Heaven and Earth in generating all things** (天地生万物之功),
and **exhaustively speak** (尽言) to **discuss** (以论) their **function** (功),
yet they do not know
that Heaven and Earth **do not exhaust themselves in speech** (不容以言而尽),
and **excessive speech** (多言) **often leads to exhaustion** (自至於穷极).
Better to **silently forget speech** (默默忘言),
merely **holding fast to the bellows and pipe’s emptiness within** (守橐钥虚中),
and **reflecting upon it** (而思之).
Then their **endless generation** (生生之不穷)
is all the **natural interplay of yin and yang** (阴阳之气自然而然).

**Ben Yi An** (本一庵居士) said:
*"Heaven and Earth’s relation to all things,
the Sage’s relation to the people,
do not **warmly nurture** (煦煦然) them with **partiality** (七).
It is only to **let them generate and transform of their own accord** (自生自化),
without **harming** (害) them.*

It is like the **straw-dog**—
when sacrificed, it is **reverently offered** (奉),
once complete, it is **cast aside** (弃).
There is no **private favor or aversion** (好恶之私),
only **timely adaptation** (時適然).
**How much more so** (況乎) for **ebbing and flowing, fullness and emptiness** (消息盈虚),
which are the **constant principles of nature** (理之常)?
Even Heaven and Earth, the Sage—
what can they do?

Only **let them fulfill their own generation** (遂其生),
**conform to their own nature** (若其性),
without **violent winds or torrential rains** (横風暴雨) to **shatter and break** (摧折),
without **erroneous governance or contradictory orders** (舛政逆令) to **obstruct and stall** (迕遏).
Then their **virtue/power** (仁) is **also perfect** (亦至矣).

The **bellows and pipe** (橐钥) as objects—
**opening and closing** (一张一翕),
only through **emptiness and unyielding resilience** (虚而不屈),
is it that **moved, yet ever more** (動而愈出).
**Ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness** (消息盈虚),
**reciprocally complete each other** (相为终始),
and it is no different.

The **earlier scholars** (先儒) said:
*"The **Yin and Yang of Heaven and Earth** (乾坤) in **movement and stillness** (动静),
cannot **close and gather** (翕聚) without **dispersing and emitting** (能发散)."*
This is the same **principle** (意).

Again, applying this **principle** (理),
between **speech and silence** (语默),
**excessive speech** (多言) leads to **exhaustion** (穷)
because it **opens without closing** (有张而无翕).
**Holding fast to the central** (守中) allows one to **remain empty yet unyielding** (虚而不屈),
thus **never exhausting** (不穷).

From the *"Lost Records"* (《拾遗》), **Lu** (陆) said:
*"All things **draw sustenance from Heaven and Earth** (资天地) to **generate** (而生).
Heaven and Earth **take nothing from all things** (无取於万物).
The people **look up to the Sage** (仰圣人) for **governance** (而治),
the Sage **borrows nothing from the people** (无假於百姓).
It is like the **straw-dog** **arising from divine offerings** (因神明) yet **used by no one** (无用於刍狗).

Only when **there is no use** (无用) is there **no partiality** (无私),
and when **there is no partiality** (无私), there is **no favor** (无恩).
Thus Heaven and Earth **have no favor** (无恩) yet **great favor is produced** (大恩生),
the Sage **is not virtuous** (不仁) yet **great virtue is achieved** (大仁成).
Therefore the people **do not decline the Sage’s virtue** (不辞德於圣人),
all things **do not repay Heaven and Earth for their generation** (不谢生於天地).

How do we **know this is so** (知其然哉)?
I observe between Heaven and Earth—
it is like the **bellows and pipe’s lack of intention** (无心).
The **bellows and pipe** (橐钥) **lack intention** (无心),
so their **sound** (声) is **unyielding** (不屈),
their **breath** (气) **flows forth ever more** (愈出).
Heaven and Earth **lack intention** (无心),
so their **generation and completion** (生成) **do not cease** (不息).
Thus **governance does not rely on excessive speech** (治不在多言),
and **excessive speech without substance** (多言而无实)
leads to **movement and exhaustion** (动数穷).

Better than **non-action and silence** (无为无言),
which is the **art of holding fast to the central** (守中之术)."

The *Zhuzi Pangzheng* cites *Zhuangzi*:

"The **straw dog** before its ritual use
is adorned with wicker baskets and embroidered cloth,
and the officiants, in solemn ritual, escort it.
But once the ritual is complete,
passersby tread upon it,
firewood gatherers burn it—
and if one were to return it to its basket,
it would be deemed monstrous.
Now, Master, you take the **straw dog** of the ancient kings—
this is not far from being trampled by passersby,
burned by firewood gatherers!"

*Wenzi* attributes to Laozi:

"The **Dao of Heaven and Earth** rules through **virtue**,
the **Way** commands it,
and things **self-regulate**.
Its subtlety within is such that it does not **elevate through deeds**.
Thus, it **stands established without awaiting merit**,
**holds honor without relying on rank**,
**shines without needing fame**,
**maintains dignity without formal rites**,
**strengthens without wielding arms**.
Thus, the **Way stands firm yet does not instruct**,
**illumination shines yet does not scrutinize**.
The **Way stands firm yet does not instruct**—
it does not **usurp others’ abilities**.
**Illumination shines yet does not scrutinize**—
it does not **hinder their affairs**.

Those who **teach the Way** act against **virtue**,
harm **things**.
Thus, yin and yang, the four seasons,
metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—
though they share the **Way**, their **principles** differ,
and all things, though they share **emotion**, differ in **form**.
The wise do not **teach one another**,
the capable do not **receive from one another**.
Thus, the Sage **enacts laws** to guide the people’s hearts,
letting each **follow its natural course**.
Thus, the living **lack no virtue**,
the dead **hold no grievance**.
Heaven and Earth are **not仁**—
they treat all things as **straw dogs**.
The Sage is **not仁**—
he treats the people as **straw dogs**.

**Compassion, love, benevolence, and righteousness**—
these are the **narrow paths**.
The narrow leads to the vast yet **loses its way**,
the near leads far yet **falls into confusion**.
The Sage’s **Way** enters the vast without **losing its way**,
travels far without **falling into confusion**,
constantly **empty and self-guarding**—
this is the **ultimate**, called **Heaven’s virtue**.

Shitian says:
"Heaven and Earth are **not仁**—
they treat all things as **straw dogs**.
The Sage is **not仁**—
he treats the people as **straw dogs**.
Heaven and Earth take **generating things** as their heart,
yet are called **not仁**—why?
Heaven and Earth **universally embrace** all things,
yet **lack intention**.
The Sage takes Heaven and Earth’s **generating heart** as his heart,
yet is also called **not仁**—why?
The Sage **measures all affairs** with his **emotion**,
yet is **without emotion**.

**Straw dog**—
the sacrificial object, as explained in *Zhuangzi*.
To treat all things as **straw dogs**—
their flourishing and decay follow **time** alone.
Each thing **returns to its own kind**;
the living **self-generate**, unaware of their source.
The Sage’s relation to the people—
he lets them **self-generate, self-nourish, self-act, self-rest**.
Since all **lack contrived intent**,
it is said:
*Heaven and Earth are **not仁**, treating all things as **straw dogs**;
the Sage is **not仁**, treating the people as **straw dogs**.*

Between Heaven and Earth—
is it not like the **bellows and pipe**?
**Empty yet unyielding**, **moving yet ever-flowing**.
Between Heaven and Earth,
what **endlessly generates** without exhaustion—
it is like the **bellows and pipe’s** ability to **emit wind**.
**Empty yet unyielding**—
Heaven and Earth **generate all things** yet are **not enslaved** by them,
meaning they are **not dominated** by things.
**Moving yet ever-flowing**—
wind **never exhausts**,
and Heaven and Earth’s generation of all things **never exhausts**.

**Excessive speech leads to exhaustion**—
it is better to **hold fast to the central**.

**Excessive speech leads to exhaustion**—
to describe Heaven and Earth, the Sage—
they **cannot be fully captured** in speech.
**Exhaustion** means even with much speech,
there remains **what cannot be expressed**.
Since **description is impossible**,
it is better to **guard the empty center**,
thus attaining the **root of Heaven and Earth’s endless generation**.

*End of Volume Ten of the Collected Meanings of the Dao/Way and Virtue Classic.
Beginning of Volume Eleven.*

**Chapter on the Valley Spirit**

Master Yǒngyuǎn, with profound Dao/Way and virtue, observed the mysteries of the Dao.
Sūnyìng, the overseer of affairs, compiled this.
Formerly, the Grand Secretary Ding Yìdōng, of the Taifu Temple and the Chancellery, annotated it.

**Annotations on Differences:**
Master Héshànggōng composed *The Chapter on Manifestation*.
Zhào Shí’ān composed *The Chapter on Nourishing the Sacred Root*.

Emperor Xuānzōng’s Commentary:
The previous chapter clarified that excessive particularity leads to private bias—
partiality makes universality difficult.
This chapter elucidates the utmost emptiness yet responsive—
its responsiveness is inexhaustible.

It begins with the **Valley Spirit**,
entrusting the spirit’s function to illuminate the Dao.
Next, it speaks of the **Mysterious Female**,
distinguishing the primal source of mysterious operation.
It concludes with **endless subtlety**,
demonstrating that emptiness in response requires no labor.

Master Dù Guāngtíng said:
The **Spirit** is what lies beyond the measure of yin and yang.

Empty yet responsive,
sensitive yet spontaneously harmonious.

Some interpret **"Valley Spirit"** as **nourishment**—
nourishing the spirit aligns with immortality.
Others explain it as **echoing response**—
responding to things like the inexhaustible spirit,
the Mysterious Female as inhaling and exhaling the primal harmony.

Refining the spirit and qi,
prolonging form and breath,
harmonizing with Heaven and Earth’s numinous essence,
endlessly enduring—
this is the Dao of longevity.

Zhang Chōngyìng said:
Between Heaven and Earth, each inhalation and exhalation
is where the **refined essence-qi** circulates.

The nose receives yang and forms its image;
the mouth receives yin and forms its image.
Without mouth and nose, yin and yang’s essence-qi
could not ascend and descend, above and below,
and the image could not manifest.
This chapter opens the insight of yin and yang’s ascent and descent.

**The Valley Spirit does not die—**
this is called the **Mysterious Female**.
The **gate of the Mysterious Female**—
this is called the **root of Heaven and Earth**.

Endlessly preserved,
its use requires no labor.

Master Héshànggōng said:
**The Valley Spirit does not die.**
*Valley* means **nourishment**—
if humans nourish the spirit, they do not die.
The **Spirit** refers to the five viscera’s spirits:
The liver stores the **hun** (ethereal soul),
the lungs store the **pò** (corporeal soul),
the heart stores the **shén** (spirit),
the kidneys store the **jīng** (essence),
the spleen stores the **zhì** (will).
When the five viscera are all injured, the five spirits depart—
this is called the **Mysterious Female**.
It speaks of the existence of non-death
lying within the Mysterious Female.

**Mysterious** is Heaven—
in humans, it is the nose.
**Female** is Earth—
in humans, it is the mouth.

Heaven nourishes humans with the five **qi**,
entering through the nose, stored in the heart.
The five **qi**, pure and subtle,
become the spirit’s clarity, intelligence, voice, and the five natures.
Its **ghost** is called the **hun**.
The **hun** is masculine, governing entry and exit through the nose,
communing with Heaven—
thus, the nose is called **Mysterious**.

Earth nourishes humans with the five **flavors**,
entering through the mouth, stored in the stomach.
The five natures, coarse and debased,
become the form, flesh, bones, blood, vessels, and six emotions.
Its **ghost** is called the **pò**.
The **pò** is feminine, governing entry and exit through the mouth,
harmonizing with Heaven and Earth—
thus, it is called **Female**.

The **gate of the Mysterious Female**—
this is called the **root of Heaven and Earth**.
*Root* means **origin**—
the nose and mouth’s gate
is where Heaven and Earth’s primal **qi** circulates.

Endlessly preserved—
the inhalations, exhalations, and breathing
should be subtly endless,
as if preserved yet nonexistent.
Its use requires no labor—
breathing should always be relaxed,
never hasty or strained.

Master Wáng Fǔsì said:
**The Valley Spirit does not die**—
the **Valley** is the central void, without grain,
without form or shadow,
without resistance or obstruction,
dwelling low yet unmoving,
guarding stillness without decay.
The **Valley** accomplishes its purpose unseen—
this is the utmost substance.
Dwelling low yet unnamed,
it is called the **root of Heaven and Earth**.

Endlessly preserved,
its use requires no labor.
The **gate** is where the Mysterious Female originates.
Tracing its origin to its extreme,
it shares the same body—
thus, it is called the **root of Heaven and Earth**.

If one speaks of its preservation,
its form is unseen.
If one speaks of its absence,
all things arise from it—
thus, it is endlessly preserved.
Without things, nothing is formed;
used yet unlabored—
hence, **"its use requires no labor."**

Emperor Xuānzōng said:
**The Valley Spirit does not die.**
*Valley* is the empty yet responsive.
*Spirit* is the wondrous yet unfathomable.
*Death* means **rest**.
The Valley’s response to sound
is unknown in its mechanism—
when stimulated, it responds like a spirit.
The spirit’s response never rests.
To illuminate the utmost Dao—
emptiness generating things,
wondrous operation beyond words—
thus, the **Valley Spirit** is used as an analogy.

This is called the **Mysterious Female**.
**Mysterious** means **deep**.
**Female** means **mother**.
The Valley Spirit’s response is profound, subtle, and inexhaustible,
capable of mothering all things—
thus, it is named the **Mysterious Female** to illuminate the great Dao’s nurturing power.

**Commentary:**
The **Valley Spirit** clarifies the spirit’s response to sound,
like the Dao’s response to things—
stimulated, it responds like a spirit.
*Spirit* is named for the unfathomable;
*death* is defined by rest.
The unfathomable response never rests—
thus, **"The Valley Spirit does not die."**

**Mysterious** means **deep**.
**Female** means **mother**.
The Valley Spirit’s deep and subtle operation is difficult to explain,
yet all things flourish through its nourishment—
thus, it is called the **Mysterious Female**.
The **gate of the Mysterious Female**—
this is called the **root of Heaven and Earth**.
The deep, subtle, and maternal operation
gives birth to all things—
thus, it is called the **gate**.
Heaven and Earth, having form,
rely on this primal endowment as their foundation.

**Commentary:**
The Mysterious Female’s operation—
when stimulated, it responds, and things emerge—
thus, it is called the **gate**.
Heaven and Earth are the greatest of formed things—
without the Mysterious Female’s operation,
they would disperse and exhaust.
Thus, they rely on this primal endowment as their foundation—
hence, **"this is called the root of Heaven and Earth."**
*Root* means **foundation**.
Endlessly preserved,
its use requires no labor—
the Mysterious Female’s operation is subtly endless,
its application effortless, requiring no exertion.

Master Dù Guāngtíng said:
**The Valley Spirit does not die**—
the meaning of the **Valley Spirit** is **echoing response and nourishing the spirit**,
divided into three distinctions.

The First speaks of the Valley’s embrace of emptiness—
when there is sound, it responds.
The Dao’s essence is formless—
cultivate it, and you attain it.

The Second speaks of the spirit’s formlessness—
when there is invocation, it attends.
The Dao’s manifestation is without image—
cultivate it, and it endures forever.

The Third speaks of the echo in the Valley—
without sound, it does not respond.
The Dao resides in the body—
without cultivation, it does not manifest.

"Not dying" does not mean the death of life and death,
but the death of rest.
If one says it is the cultivation of the body’s dissolution,
then it is the death of life and death.

The first is: nourishing the spirit brings eternal life and non-death,
the second is: echoing response without cessation—
this is the death of rest.

The Mysterious (玄) is Heaven—
in humans, it is the nose.
The Female (牝) is Earth—
in humans, it is the mouth.

The original and harmonious *qi*, the enlightened and luminous spirit,
within the body, entering and exiting through nose and mouth,
breathing in response to nourish the body—
thus, it is called the Valley Spirit.

Again, Heaven’s five *qi* enter through the nose,
their spirit is called *hun*—
ascending, it communicates with Heaven.
Earth’s five flavors enter through the mouth,
their spirit is called *pò*—
descending, it communicates with Earth.

Speaking of nourishing *qi* makes one a companion of Heaven—
practiced endlessly, one may attain eternal life,
refining *yin* with *yang*.

Eating flavors makes one a companion of Earth—
practiced endlessly, it breeds illness and leads to death,
refining *yang* with *yin*.

Master Laozi commands nourishing the spirit and treasuring the form,
abstaining from grains and eating *qi*—
this is the Dao of non-death,
hence, **"the Mysterious Female’s gate, the root of Heaven and Earth."**

The Mysterious Female’s gate—
this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.

It is not only that humans rely on the Mysterious Female’s circulation of *qi*
to attain eternal life.
Heaven and Earth, vast as they are,
also require the Dao’s *qi* to circulate and nourish them,
only then can they remain pure and tranquil without change.

As the lower scripture says:
*"Heaven, without purity, would fear cleaving,*
*Earth, without tranquility, would fear dispersing.*
Heaven and Earth losing the Dao
still face the perils of collapse and dissipation—
how much more so for the human body,
if it does not uphold the central and preserve the One!"

Endlessly preserved,
its use requires no labor—
Heaven and Earth rely on *qi* naturally,
thus enduring forever.
Human breathing through nose and mouth
should be endlessly subtle and mysterious—
as if existing yet not existing,
not to be forced with haste or exhaustion.

The Dao of governing the realm,
when laws are enacted,
should balance severity with gentleness,
gentleness with severity—
for if laws are too lenient, the people grow slack,
if too harsh, the people are ruined.
If one governs the world with the Dao of purity and tranquility,
and the people are spared laborious exertion,
then the common folk will be devoted,
their blessings enduring and prolonged,
endlessly preserved like melons, gourds, and *gu* plants—
thus, it is said: *"Endlessly preserved, its use requires no labor."*

Master Song Daojun said:
*"The Valley Spirit does not die."*
What has form has flourishing and decline,
what has measure has completion and ruin.
Form and measure together bring life and death—
this is the principle of all things.
The Valley responds to all things yet remains ever empty,
the spirit transcends all things yet remains ever still.
Within the eternal truth,
it is one with the Dao,
not clinging to form,
not falling into measure.
Generating life without end,
like the sun and moon—
eternally unceasing,
like the Great Bear—
eternally unerring.
Thus, it is said: *"It does not die."*
This is called the Mysterious Female.

All things receive their mandate from the formless,
yet take shape in the formed.
The Valley’s operation is without likeness,
the spirit’s essence is without boundary—
this is where all things receive their mandate.
The Mysterious is Heaven’s hue,
the Female is Earth’s kind—
this is where all things take shape.
The Valley Spirit illustrates the eternal Dao,
the Mysterious Female reveals the marvel of creation.
The Mysterious Female’s gate—
this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.

Zhuangzi said:
*"All things have their source in birth, yet no one sees their root;
they emerge, yet no one sees their gate.
Only the sage sees them."*
Thus, it is said here:
*"The Mysterious Female’s gate—
this is called the root of Heaven and Earth."*
Heaven and Earth are the above and below of all things.
Things and Heaven and Earth originally have no sequence—
to clarify the great Dao’s order,
Heaven and Earth come first, then all things.
Yet what Heaven and Earth emerge from is the Mysterious Female.
Who before Heaven and Earth could see it?
Endlessly preserved,
its use requires no labor—
from its own root, its own foundation,
eternally established since antiquity,
like fire’s transmission—
one does not know when it will end.
This is called *"endlessly preserved."*
Vastly created by Heaven,
a single *qi* moving on its own,
suddenly transforming itself,
entrusting all forms to proliferate—
*Li* is easily understood,
*Kun* is simply capable,
not achieved by force—
what labor is there?

Master Wang Anshi said:
*"The Valley Spirit does not die—
this is called the Mysterious Female."*
The Valley is able to be empty,
able to contain,
able to be full,
able to respond.
With these four virtues,
unknown in their operation,
thus it is called *spirit*.
With its spirit, it does not die—
if it dies, it does not generate,
not generating, yet able to generate,
generating yet unseen in its progress.
The Female takes the meaning of generating things,
generating things yet unseen in its actions—
thus it is called Mysterious.
*The Classic of Changes* says:
*"The Great Polarity generates the Two Principles—
this too is the Mysterious Female."*
The Mysterious Female’s gate—
this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
Its gate is the origin from which Heaven and Earth are born.
Speaking of it as existing is like saying it exists—
endlessly preserved,
its use requires no labor.
"Endlessly" refers to distant yet unbroken speech.
Though Heaven’s Dao is endlessly preserved,
the sage employs it without exertion,
all arising naturally.
Truly, the sage uses the formless to govern the world’s forms,
using surplus to supplement the world’s deficiencies.

Master Su Yingbin said:
*"The Valley Spirit does not die—
this is called the Mysterious Female."*
The Valley, though empty, still has form and outline,
the spirit is empty and formless.
Empty and formless—
how could there be birth?
How could there be death?
Even calling it the Valley Spirit speaks of its virtue—

This is called the Mysterious Female, speaking of its function.
The Mysterious Female gives birth to all things,
yet it is called Mysterious—
for one sees its birth but not the means by which it births.

The gate of the Mysterious Female,
this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
The gate of the Mysterious Female,
speaking of all things arising from it.
The root of Heaven and Earth,
speaking of Heaven and Earth arising from it.

Endlessly preserved, yet used without labor.
"Endlessly" refers to subtlety without cessation;
"as if it exists" refers to existence without visibility.
If one can thus, though used all day,
there is no exhaustion.

Master Lü Jìfǔ said:
*"The Valley Spirit does not die—
this is called the Mysterious Female."*
The Valley is the form that can be seen,
yet because it attains Oneness,
it is empty yet able to fill.
The Spirit is formless,
yet because it attains Oneness,
it is tranquil yet able to respond with vitality.
If a person can guard the Center and attain Oneness,
then the form that can be seen—
the body—
can be made empty like the Valley,
and the formless heart
can be made tranquil like the Spirit,
then the form and formless are united without death.

The ancients said:
*"The body unites with the heart,
the heart unites with the qi,
the qi unites with the Spirit,
the Spirit unites with the Formless—
this is their teaching."*
If united, there is no death;
if no death, then no birth;
if no birth yet able to give birth,
this is called the Mysterious Female.

The Formless refers to the union of having and not having;
The Female refers to the ability to give birth endlessly.
The gate of the Mysterious Female,
this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
The Dao’s birth of Heaven and Earth
comes from this alone—
thus it is said as such.

Endlessly preserved, yet used without labor.
Is it said to be lost?
Then it is endlessly preserved yet never ceases.
Is it said to exist?
Then how could one see its existence?
As if it exists—
if it is lost yet not ceasing,
if it exists yet not visibly so,
then my use of it
holds no concern for existence or loss—
it is simply applied without reflection.
Where is there labor?

Master Lù Nóngshī said:
*"The Valley Spirit does not die—
this is called the Mysterious Female."*
The one who gives birth endlessly does not generate;
the one who kills life does not die.
The Valley Spirit,
Formless yet containing and responding.
The Mysterious Female,
Mysterious yet embodying both female and male.
Thus it is said: The Valley Spirit does not die—
this is called the Mysterious Female.

The gate of the Mysterious Female,
this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
The Mysterious Female,
this is the birth of Heaven and Earth.
The so-called gate of the Mysterious Female,
its offspring arise from it yet cannot be seen—
thus it is said.

Hence, Zhuangzi said:
*"Though there be birth, one cannot see its gate—
this is what is meant."*

Endlessly preserved, yet used without labor.
It seems to exist yet also seems not to exist,
it seems to be preserved yet also seems not to be preserved—
its operation never ceases,
its use never exerts itself,
thus it is said: Endlessly preserved, yet used without labor.

The *Yijing* says: *"Endless coming and going is called Communion"*;
Zhuangzi says: *"Continuously thus without pause is called Fate"*;
and Laozi says: *"The Spirit’s vitality, if not ceaseless, would fear exhaustion."*

Truly, endless coming and going without pause or exhaustion,
this is the Spirit alone—
thus it is called "endlessly preserved."

The Valley Spirit speaks of its function,
the Mysterious Female speaks of its essence.

Master Wáng Yuànzé said:
*"The Valley Spirit does not die—
this is called the Mysterious Female."*
The Valley responds yet never exhausts,
the Spirit transforms yet cannot be measured—
all things receive their mandate from it,
yet it never generates, never dies—
this is the Valley Spirit.
Speaking of the Spirit reaches its peak,
yet adding "Valley" refers to its ability to be empty and full,
and yet to contain and respond—
because it is active yet never worn out,
it is simply called "does not die."

The Valley Spirit receives the mandate while the Mysterious Female embodies form—
it itself becomes yin and yang to complete Heaven and Earth,
yet originally it is one thing.
It begins from its reception of the mandate,
thus called the Valley Spirit.
From its embodiment of form,
thus called the Mysterious Female.

The gate of the Mysterious Female,
this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
The Mysterious Female,
its essence is yin yet unified—
within its essence, there are yin and yang called its gate,
different from a door.
All things arise from this gate yet cannot be seen,
thus called the gate of the Mysterious Female.

Endlessly preserved, yet used without labor.
"Endlessly" refers to the Valley drawing and not ceasing—
this is called the Spirit.
The Mysterious Female gives birth endlessly yet is neither fixed as having nor not having—
its use without labor is because movement brings forth more,
where is there labor?

Master Liú Zhòngpíng said:
*"The Valley Spirit does not die, to its use without labor."*
The Valley is empty yet able to contain and respond.
The Formless is the gate of the Mysterious.
The Female is gentle, tranquil, and profound,
having receptivity without depletion,
having acceptance without emission.
The Valley and the Spirit never generate,
never die,
yet it is said alone: "The Valley Spirit does not die"—
for if it does not die, then it does not generate,
this is clear.

Endlessly preserved, yet used without labor.
It is said: "Its use is as if it exists."
Its use without labor is the use of non-use.

Master Liú Jùjì said:
*"The Valley Spirit does not die—
this is called the Mysterious Female."*
The Spirit as Spirit,
its emptiness is unyielding,
its response is inexhaustible,
yet no trace can be seen—
thus the Valley is used as a symbol,
and it is called the Valley Spirit,
because the Valley is empty yet responds.

Truly, if there is birth, then there is no one who does not die,
yet only the one who does not die can give birth—
giving birth yet never dying,
then it can give birth endlessly.
This is called the constant state of no desire.
No death is called the Spirit.
Giving birth endlessly is called the Female,
its essence is one.
Thus it is called the Mysterious Female.

The Female is the Mother.
Adding the Formless makes it the Dao—
like *Formless Communion*, *Formless Oneness*, or *Formless Virtue*.

The gate of the Mysterious Female,
this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
The Mysterious Female,
its birth is its homeland—
like a gate.
Heaven and Earth flow in form,
originating from the Mysterious Female—
like a root.

Only the constant state of no desire
can give birth yet not die,
thus called the Formless Spirit.
If there is birth, there is a Mother,
thus the Spirit is called the Mysterious Female.

Once born, it takes form,
thus called the Mysterious Female as the root of Heaven and Earth.

The Formless is the Dao—
the Dao is Heaven and Earth.

Continuous yet as if existing,
using it without effort.

Continuous—
this describes unending birth.
Unending birth,
its thread of life seems to exist,
yet in truth, it does not truly exist.

*"As if"*—
this is not a proper affirmation of its existence,
like the silkworm becoming its cocoon,
or the spider weaving its web—
separating them is endless,
yet seeking them is fruitless.

Using it without exertion—
this refers to the Spirit’s use,
not the human’s use.
Its reason for not laboring:
emptiness and responsiveness.

Earlier, it was specifically said that responsiveness exists,
so how could there not be exertion?

The previous chapter spoke of the analogy of the *túshuò* [鐙鈐, stirrup-spring],
thus next comes *Gu-Shen* [谷神, Grain-Spirit].

Though this chapter speaks of the Dao’s ultimate principle,
the Spirit’s cultivation for the body is no different.

For when the essence is complete, the *qi* is complete,
when the *qi* is complete, the Spirit is complete,
and when the Spirit is complete,
it neither dies nor is born.

Liu Ji [刘骥] said:
*"Gu-Shen* does not die—
the Dao descends as *qi*,
*qi* settles as the embryo,
the embryo condenses as the Spirit,
and the Spirit ascends daily as the *Xian* [仙, Immortal]—
thus the Dao is the method of cultivating life."

From Formless to Form,
Form is the *qi*-Mother.

The body is the Spirit’s dwelling,
nurturing the body preserves the Spirit.

*Qi* is the Spirit’s Mother,
having *qi* sustains the child.

Thus the term *Qi-Mother*—
this is the true foundation of longevity.

The Classic says: *"Gu-Shen* does not die,
this is called the Mysterious Female."

The Mysterious Female—
this is *Gu-Shen* itself.

*Gu-Shen* draws in *qi*,
which descends to the Mysterious Female.
Examining its origin,
the Mysterious Female precedes *Gu-Shen*,
then *Gu-Shen* follows.

For human life,
from *Ren* [壬] to *Gui* [癸],
the two kidneys mark its beginning and end.

Yet in its function,
*Gu-Shen* precedes the Mysterious Female—
for human breath originates from the two nostrils,
while the *Dan-Tian* [丹田] receives it.

The *qi*, drawn continuously by *Gu-Shen*,
never fully dissipates,
its use lies in the subtlest realm.

When sustained long,
the *qi* rests in the Mysterious Female,
no longer drawn from *Gu-Shen*—
this is *Tái-Xī* [胎息, Embryonic Breath].

The *qi* in the Mysterious Female,
like a child in the womb,
requires no external breathing—
breathing arises from within.

Thus its method begins with *continuous yet as if existing*,
and ends with *breathing not external*—
this is the *Tái-Xian* [胎仙, Embryonic Immortality].

Some say the nostrils are the Mysterious,
the mouth is the Female—
nose inhales the pure,
mouth exhales the impure.

Others say: *"Closing the Earth-House [地户] reveals its presence in the nostrils,
not in the mouth."*

Again: *"The mouth and nostrils are not the Mysterious Female,
for the Mysterious Female lies in the lower field [下田]."*

Indeed, it is not spoken of through its gates of entry and exit,
but divided by force alone.

*Gu-Shen* is also called *Shen-Lú* [神庐, Spirit-Dwelling],
the Mysterious Female is also called *Dan-Tian* [丹田].

The *Huangting* [《黄庭》] says:
*"Breathing enters the Spirit-Dwelling through the field."*

The Classic says: *"Gu-Shen* does not die,
this is called the Mysterious Female."

The gate of the Mysterious Female—
this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.

The *Du-Ren Jing* [《度人经》] says:
*"Opening the Three Brightnesses [三景],
this is called the Heavenly Root."*

The Three Brightnesses—
these are the *Xuan-Yuan* [玄元, Dark Primordial] *Shi-Qi* [始气, Originating *Qi*].

This is called *Qi-Mother*—
later giving birth to Heaven and Earth,
arranged as the Three Celestial Marks [三辰],
also called Three Brightnesses,
due to their inner and outer nature.

The Mysterious Female is the inner *Gu-Shen*.

The *Yu* [御] commentary says:
*"Grain responds to all movement while remaining ever empty,
the Spirit marvels at all things while remaining ever still.
This is akin to earlier words on the *túshuò* [鐙鈐],
which stays empty to await the *qi*—
all such analogies illustrate the Dao’s grand essence."*

Its foundation is that *Gu* [谷] contains the Spirit—
this is *emptiness* containing the Spirit,
achieved through nurturing stillness,
not like the emptiness of a hollow grain.

The *Huangting* [《黄庭》] says:
*"Within emptiness, serene and tranquil—
the Spirit arises naturally."*

For the nature is the heart’s function,
the heart is the nature’s Spirit.

Movement lies in the *ji* [机, mechanism],
stillness is held by the *qi*.

The *Xi-Yi* [希夷, Rare and Exalted] symbol—
this is the Dao.

The Dao’s essence—
this is the *one* *qi* of Formless and Emptiness.

The *one* *qi*’s function—
this is nature.

Nature—
this is *Gu-Shen*.

The *one* *qi* at rest—
this is nature.

When nature is still, all transformations are at peace.

The *one* *qi* in motion—
this is emotion.

When nature moves, all transformations arise.
The Sage preserves the Original Spirit in the Celestial *Gu* [谷].

The Celestial *Gu*—
this is the space between emptiness and void,
emptiness and void—
the realm of Formless and Emptiness.

Pure *qi* and pure nature—
the root of all transformations.

The *Zheng Yuan Jun* [正元君, Upright Primordial Lord] speaks in terms of palaces:
the *Gu* is called the Celestial *Gu*.
The Celestial *Gu*—
this is the *Niwan Palace* [泥丸宫].

The *Niwan Palace*—
this is the chamber of Formless and Emptiness.

When a person preserves the Spirit,
the Five *Qi* naturally come to pay homage,
descending through the *Xuanpin* [玄牝, Mysterious Female].

The *Xuanpin*—
this is the path of Heaven and Earth’s ascent and descent.

Thus observed,
one knows that the *one qi* flows upward and downward:
in the Celestial *Gu*, it becomes *jinjing* [金精, Essence of Metal];
in the *Xuanpin*, it becomes *yuye* [玉液, Jade Nectar].

It is also said:
When the *Xuanpin* is firmly established at a hundred breaths,
its *qi* passes through the *Lingguan* [灵关, Spirit Pass],
stirring the *Tianguan* [天门, Heavenly Gate] above,
and descending through the *Dihu* [地户, Earthly Portal] below—
this may be called the *Miaodao* [妙道, Marvelous Way].

The *Lingshu* [《灵枢》] states:
*The Mysterious Female connects above to the Celestial Gu,*
*and descends below to the Earthly Portal.*

From cultivating *qi* to dwelling in *qi*,
when more is taken in than expelled,
this appears in the *Zhen* [☳] hexagram;
when more is expelled than taken in,
this appears in the *Li* [☲] hexagram.
At sunset, it is gathered—
refined by the *Qian* [☰] hexagram.

This is the daily method of scholars for gathering and taking.

When *qi* is held without entering or exiting,
this is called *taixi* [胎息, Womb-Breathing].
One ascent, one descent—
this becomes the *Longhu* [龙虎, Dragon-Tiger].

This is another method of refining the elixir.

*Qi* is one in essence,
yet its methods differ—
thus, the affairs of immortals and transcendent beings
cannot be achieved by a single approach.

The *Taixi* theory relies on dwelling in *qi*;
when the Spirit is present, it becomes the way of immortals and transcendent beings—
this can be verified.

**Second Section: Clarifying the Mysterious Female**

The *Xuanpin* is spoken of:
The nose has two nostrils,
which descend to the kidneys.
The kidneys have two gates—
*Xuan* [玄, Mysterious] is yang,
*Pin* [牝, Female] is yin.
The two kidneys are likewise.

Daily practice lies in alternating left and right.

Next, it returns to the original flow.
The gate of the *Xuanpin*—
this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.

The *Yu Zhu* [御注, Imperial Annotation] cites the *Zhuangzi* [《庄子》]:
*"All things have their source of life, yet no one sees its root;
they have their place of emergence, yet no one sees its gate—
only the Sage can perceive this."*

This is profound speech.

The Dao in relation to Heaven and Earth,
all things in relation to *Kan* [☵] and *Li* [☲]—
life arises on its own, transformations unfold on their own,
nature is its own nature, fate is its own fate.
Who is the root? Who is the gate?
Speaking in terms of *ziran* [自然, Self-So],
one does not know why it is so.
Speaking in terms of the True Sovereign,
is there truly no gate, no root?
Yet only the Sage can perceive this.

Those who do not see cannot enter through the gate,
those without a gate cannot recognize the root of life.
This matter lies in the *tianji* [天机, Heavenly Mechanism]—
who else but the Sage can partake in this?

Thus it is said:
Knowing and refining it makes one a Sage.

The *Xuan* [玄] is the *one*;
the *Pin* [牝] is the *mother*.
The *one* arises from emptiness,
the *mother* unites through movement.
Seeking yin is yang,
receiving yang is the mother.
The *one* does not await birth,
yet birth arises on its own.
The mother does not await union,
yet emotion is naturally stirred.

The *Yijing* [《易》] says:
*"Water flows to dampness,
fire turns toward dryness,
clouds follow the dragon,
wind follows the tiger."*
This is an inevitable principle.

Thus, when *Kan* [☵] and *Li* [☲] unite at *hai* [亥, 11 PM],
one *yang* begins at *ren* [壬] in the northwest.

*Ren* is yang-water,
uniting with *ding* [丁]’s yin-fire to produce *bing* [丙].
*Bing* is yang-fire,
uniting with *xin* [辛]’s yin-metal to produce *geng* [庚].
*Geng* is yang-metal,
uniting with *yi* [乙]’s yin-wood to produce *jia* [甲].
*Jia* is yang-wood,
uniting with *ji* [己]’s yin-earth to produce *wu* [戊].
*Wu* is yang-earth,
uniting with *gui* [癸]’s yin-water to produce *ren* [壬].
This is the principle of husband and wife.

Humans have two kidneys:
left is *chang* [场, field], right is *yin* [阴, darkness].
Left is the kidney, right is the *mingmen* [命门, Gate of Life].
At the inception of *ren* [壬],
the *mingmen* begins to form.

Only with the *mingmen* does the heart arise,
the heart generates blood—
following *ding* [丁] producing *bing* [丙].
The heart generates the lungs,
the lungs generate skin and hair—
following *xin* [辛] producing *geng* [庚].
Only with the lungs does the liver arise,
the liver governs sinews—
following *yi* [乙] producing *jia* [甲].
Only with the liver does the spleen arise,
the spleen generates flesh—
following *ji* [己] producing *wu* [戊].
The spleen generates the kidneys,
the kidneys generate bone marrow—
following *gui* [癸] producing *ren* [壬].
With the kidneys, they unite with the *mingmen* to form two.

Thus observed,
from the *one qi* of Heaven’s Primordium as root,
it is already established as *one*.
How could it lack a name?
The name is the mother of all things.

In *Qian* [☰], it begins and thrives.
The beginning is the *Yuan Shi* [元始, Primordial Origin],
governing Heaven—
thus one knows that *Qian* governs the Original *Qi*.

Exiting, it becomes yang;
entering, it becomes yin.
This is how the *Gu Shen* [谷神] breathes,
how the *Xuanpin* collects and stores—
all things receive their fate from this.

How could there be no root to take hold,
no gate to emerge from?
Those who seek to see it
must perceive it here.

Thus, from the *one qi* dividing into yin and yang,
Heaven and Earth are thereby magnified.
Beginning with *ren* [壬], it generates the Five Organs,
the human body is thereby completed.

In Heaven and Earth, there is something knowable—
in the human body, the two *qi* ascend and descend,
breathing and sighing, merging in harmony.
Only those with profound insight can achieve this.

**Third Section: Clarifying the Methods of Regulation and Mastery**

Soft and enduring, as if preserved,
yet used without exertion.

Those who receive their fate from yin and yang
cannot depart from the numbers of yin and yang,
those who entrust their form to life and death
cannot escape the authority of life and death.

Indeed, human life
is endowed with fixed numbers—
this is the principle of Heaven and Earth.
Using numbers to govern people,
if one uses numbers without knowing their limits,
then those who perish prematurely in mid-course exist.
If one obtains the numbers and transcends them beyond things,
then those who achieve longevity and immortality exist.

What are these numbers?
One, three, five, seven, nine—
two, four, six, eight, ten.

From where do these numbers arise?
They originate from the *one qi* of the Yellow Palace’s Heavenly Primordium.

Thus, the human body follows the *one*;
Heaven and Earth span eighty-four thousand *li* above and below.
At the two solstices’ intersection,
the operations of *Kan* [☵] and *Li* [☲] unfold.
One inhalation, the pulse travels three *cun*;
one exhalation, the pulse travels three *cun*.
Between inhalation and exhalation, the pulse travels six *cun*.
In one day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred breaths—
half yin, half yang.
From *hai* [亥] to *si* [巳], the *yingqi* [营气, Nourishing Qi] travels
twenty-five degrees of yang,
twenty-five degrees of yin,
totaling twelve *shi* [时] and one hundred *ke* [刻] of water clock measurements.

The waxing and waning, the full and the empty—
thus completing the yearly function,
harmonizing the Five *Qi* [五气].
Do not precede it with excess,
nor follow it with deficiency,
then yin and yang will be balanced in due measure.

If balance is lost,
the Five *Qi* will stray and conflict,
in Heaven becoming *victory and reversal* [胜复],
in man disrupting the Five *Zàng* [五藏, visceral organs],
and from this all diseases arise.
The art of its application lies in what can and cannot be done.

The Classic says: *"Gentle and enduring as if it exists"* [绵绵若存],
for *gentle and enduring* is the *one qi* [一气].
Draw the *one qi* between the *Gǔshén* [谷神, Grain Spirit] and the *Xīngshén* [神, Vital Spirit],
making it so subtle and weak
that its sound cannot be heard,
its movement cannot be felt—
seemingly nonexistent yet present,
seemingly present yet imperceptible,
thus it appears to exist.

So, the *Yíng* [营, Nourishing] and *Wèi* [卫, Defensive] *Qi* remain ever attuned,
the Six *Mài* [脉, pulses] do not overrun,
the ascent and descent of purity and turbidity
never lose their proper timing,
and panting or breathing
never become violent.

The *Mèngzǐ* [《孟子》] says: *"Hold firm to your resolve and do not exhaust your qi* [持其志无暴其气]."
The *Kāngcāngzǐ* [《亢仓子》] says: *"The body conforms to qi,
qi conforms to the heart,
the heart conforms to the spirit,
the spirit conforms to the formless* [体合於气，气合於心，心合於神，神合於无]."
The *Yùzhù* [御注] says: *"From its own foundation and root,
it has been thus from ancient times.*
As fire spreads,
one does not know its end."

When qi conforms to the spirit,
yin and yang cannot control life.
The *Yì* [《易》] says: *"Yin and yang are unfathomable"* [阴阳不测者是也].
Life and death cannot be manipulated.
The *Zhuāngzǐ* [《庄子》] says: *"This is the 'life and death that are neither life nor death'* [彼为生杀非生杀者是也]."
All this lies in not exerting oneself.

But those who dwell within Heaven and Earth,
yet go against the yin-yang numbers,
are those who cannot master qi.
When external things seduce,
they are instead overtaken by qi—
how much more so by those called *thieves of vital essence* [盗机]?

Thus, Heaven and Earth endure eternally
through this very principle.
Shào Ruòyú [邵若愚] says: *"The Grain Spirit does not die—
this is the Dao of 'use it not to exhaustion'* [谷神不死至用之不勤]."
The Grain is used to illustrate emptiness.
Emptiness is the *Dao* [道].
The Spirit is the *one qi* of Dao’s transformation,
the 'having within the formless' [无中之有].
The formless emptiness has no shape;
it is originally without birth,
yet also without death.
Thus it is said: *"The Grain Spirit does not die."*

Emptiness is the root of all things,
called *Xuan* [玄, Mysterious].
The Spirit is the origin of transformation,
called *Pìn* [牝, Feminine].
The Grain Spirit is thus the *Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝].
All things issue from the *Mysterious Feminine*’s gate,
this is called *the root of life and Earth* [生天地根].
To observe the Grain Spirit as *gentle and enduring as if it exists* [绵绵若存],
those who practice it must make the spirit conform to emptiness,
not through strenuous effort or contrived technique,
nor through cultivated skill or force.

Wáng Zhìrán [王志然] says: *"The Grain Spirit does not die—
this is the Dao of 'use it not to exhaustion'* [谷神不死至用之不勤]."
The *Mysterious Feminine* takes Heaven and Earth as its root,
yet all things are born from it without revealing its root.
The *Yì* [《易》] uses *Qián* [乾, Heavenly] and *Kūn* [坤, Earthly] as its gate,
yet all things emerge from it without revealing its gate.
Those who perceive it must be *sages* [圣人].

The Classic says: *"The Grain Spirit does not die—
this is called the Mysterious Feminine* [谷神不死，是谓玄牝]."
The Grain embodies emptiness;
emptiness can nourish the spirit,
and the spirit remains ever-present,
so it does not die.

The Dao of the Grain Spirit is wondrous beyond transmission.
It is explained thus: *"This is the Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝]."
*Xuan* [玄] is the gate of the wondrous Dao.

The *Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝] is the root of Heaven and Earth,
the *having within the formless* [无中之有],
the *Feminine* [牝] is the embodiment of Earth’s principle.
Penetrating the distinctions of day and night,
exhausting the origins of yin and yang,
fathoming the vital essence of life and death,
comprehending the transformations of birth and death—
following the *one qi* of creation,
ascending and descending without end,
the Grain is ever-emptying and receives its mandate from Heaven,
the Spirit is ever-quiescent and takes form from Earth.
One emergence brings forth life,
one withdrawal brings forth transformation—
all things return to their natural source.

Its source was never born,
yet its means of birth are without origin;
its source was never transformed,
yet its means of transformation reach no destination.
This is what the *Zhuāngzǐ* [《庄子》] calls *"never having died nor ever having been born"* [未尝死而未尝生].

The *Lièzǐ* [《列子》] says:
There is the *born* [生生],
the *formed* [形形],
the *heard* [声声],
the *seen* [色色],
the *tasted* [味味].
The *born* that is born dies,
yet the *born* that is born without end never ceases.
The *formed* that is formed is solid,
yet the *formed* that is formed without substance never exists.
The *heard* that is heard is audible,
yet the *heard* that is heard without sound never emits.
The *seen* that is seen is manifest,
yet the *seen* that is seen without appearance never displays.
The *tasted* that is tasted is savored,
yet the *tasted* that is tasted without flavor never presents.

Without knowing,
without ability,
without not knowing,
without inability—
what I desire to learn
must be the subtlety of *"never ceasing, never existing, never emitting, never displaying, never presenting"* [未尝终、未尝有、未尝发、未尝显、未尝呈].

To embody yin and yang,
ride the transformations,
flank the sun and moon,
embrace the cosmos—
to ascend and play with the Creator,
to descend and befriend the external,
the deathless, the endless—
this is the *Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝],
this is the *Grain Spirit* [谷神].

To seek neither death nor life
from this is impossible.
The *Zhuāngzǐ* [《庄子》] says:
*"When virtue is cultivated and returns to its original,
this is the Primordial True Person* [性修反德，德至同为初真人]."
To rest in this state,
one’s breath becomes profound and deep,
called *gentle and enduring as if it exists* [绵绵若存],
this is the Dao of *"use it not to exhaustion"* [用之不勤].

Ah! This Dao is very easy to know,
very easy to practice,
yet few can know it,
few can practice it—
why is this so?
Because those who study it
have not yet illuminated the profound roots of stillness and extremity,
of entering death and returning to life.

When subtlety is mastered here,
one can govern Heaven and Earth,
store all things,
ascend to the Great Brightness above,
reach the utmost Yang’s origin,
enter the Gate of Obscurity,
attain the utmost Yin’s source.

Obtaining the traces of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang,
one then knows where the *Mysterious Feminine* and *Grain Spirit* reside.

Huáng Màocái [黄茂材] says:
*"The Grain Spirit does not die—
this is called the Mysterious Feminine* [谷神不死，是谓玄牝]."
The Grain embodies emptiness;
emptiness can nourish the spirit,
and the spirit remains ever-present,
so it does not die.

The Dao of the Grain Spirit is wondrous beyond transmission—
it is explained thus: *"This is the Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝]."
*Xuan* [玄] is the gate of the wondrous Dao.

The Mysterious Feminine is the origin of all things.
The Gate of the Mysterious Feminine is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
*Xuan* [玄] is the Gate of the wondrous Dao,
*Pin* [牝] is the origin of all things.

Seeking it within myself,
what substance is it, indeed?
Seeking it and finding it impossible,
then seeking what gives birth to my body,
what substance is that, indeed?

Heaven and Earth and I all originate from the Mysterious Feminine;
knowing what gives birth to my body,
one then knows the root of Heaven and Earth.

The Classic says: *"Deep-rooted and firm-founded,
the Dao of long life and enduring vision—
this is it."*

Continuous as if ever-present,
its use requires no effort.
"Continuous" means successive.
"Continuous as if ever-present"
also describes the Dao of the undying.

The superior scholar hears the Dao,
and diligently practices it.
Now, why is its use without effort?
The diligent have moments when they are not diligent,
but those who use it without effort
are never not diligent—
this aligns with the Dao.

There is no greater diligence than this.

Chéng Tàizhī [程泰之] says:
*"The Grain Spirit does not die."*
The Master Lao had many allusions to the Grain,
saying: *"Vast as the Valley, for its breadth,"*
and *"The Valley receives One and is filled,"*
speaking of its capacity to receive.
*"Be the Valley of the world,"*
*"The rivers and seas can be kings of all the Valleys,"*
all praise its virtue of humility.

Yet this chapter uniquely reveals profound truths:
the Spirit, the undying,
the ever-present—
its deepest meaning and practical application
are not the same as other texts that merely liken the Grain.

Other schools offer no further insight,
only saying that the Grain’s emptiness
is indeed the Spirit,
but emptiness alone is insufficient.
Following its undying nature,
its ever-presence,
and contemplating its essence,
one sees that emptiness alone
cannot fully capture its description.

Emperor Xuānzōng of the Tang [唐明皇] explained it thus:
*"It responds to sensation—
its response is like the Spirit,
for it is the very meaning of sound producing echo."*

Other schools, having followed the Emperor’s revelation,
later began to cite his interpretation
as their own insight.
Before this, none had spoken of it.

The echo’s generation with form’s shadow
shares the same principle.
Yet shadows cast by form are not identical—
whether by sun, moon, water, or fire,
all things with light produce shadows.
Thus, if one seeks the origin of shadows,
they look to the sun and moon but find none,
then turn to water and fire,
and the principle can be made clear.

But sound’s emergence differs.
When released into the wild, it disperses;
when striking the mountains, it is muffled.
Only the Grain—
exteriorly curved, interiorly hollow—
when sound enters it,
resonates back and forth,
and thus harmonizes to produce echo.
Therefore, though Heaven is vast
and all things are many,
only this Grain can produce echo from the void,
and thus possess this Spirit.

Swift or fine, long or short,
much or little—
it responds to sensation and generates,
each instance resembling the original.
If not taken from this Grain,
where else could one find the Spirit?

Only when one knows the Spirit belongs to this
does it become undying and ever-present,
and all can be deduced.

It was only when Dàchāng [大昌] grasped this principle
that he felt it was fitting yet dared not assert it deeply,
until he encountered the *Listed Child* [列子] citing the Yellow Emperor’s words
to elucidate the Master Lao’s teachings,
and then he was firmly convinced beyond doubt.

The *Listed Child*’s words on transformation
fully cite the Yellow Emperor’s original discourse on the Grain Spirit,
to prove that the continuous generation and transformation
is the Grain’s ability to be the Spirit,
to be undying,
to be ever-present—
all are named by this.

Further, he explains that all things’ birth and death
come from entering and exiting the mechanism,
and he cites the Yellow Emperor’s words to clarify:
*"Form moves but does not generate form—
it generates shadow.
Sound moves but does not generate sound—
it generates echo.
The Void moves but does not generate the Void—
it generates the Having."*

The principle he aligns with
is perfectly consistent with earlier teachings.
Thus, Dàchāng saw that the Yellow Emperor’s two meanings
were originally one chapter,
but the *Listed Child*’s phrasing
happened to diverge slightly,
so he also split them into two.

The reader must combine their differing expressions
to trace the underlying thread,
and then clarity will emerge.

As for the Grain’s ability to be the Spirit,
it can be deduced.

When it is hollow,
in the Dao it is the Void.
When sound strikes it,
it responds to sensation and thus has substance.
The Having moves and strikes the Void,
the Void receives and thus is hollow,
so the Grain responds to sound and generates echo—
the image of generation without self-generation.

When sound ceases and striking stops,
the Void remains void in perception,
and the Spirit cannot always be the Spirit.
If there is further striking,
its response is as before,
and then one knows that transformation
does not transform itself.

This is why it attains
the undying and the ever-present.

The *Classic of Changes* [《易》] says:
*"Without thought,
without action,
quietly unmoving,
responsive and thus communicating—
this is Heaven’s way."*

Its lack of thought and action,
its quiet stillness,
are the Grain’s image of Void without sensation.
When sensation comes, it immediately responds,
producing echo and answering sound—
this is the unmeasurable Spirit.

The *Classic of Changes* speaks of divination’s Spirit,
saying: *"It is about to act,
it is about to move—
ask it, and it will respond as if receiving a command,
with no distinction between near and far, deep or shallow,
and thus one knows the coming thing."*

Divination’s response as if receiving a command
is the *Classic of Changes*’s sensation and communication.
Thus, it also borrows the metaphor of echo and response.

The Master Lao’s book stands alone,
refusing to be confused with the *Classic of Changes*,
so though he extols this Grain’s Spirit greatly,
he does not directly imitate the *Classic of Changes*’s echo and response.

Yet in seeking its principle,
there is no difference.

The *Listed Child* truly had insight here,
combining the Yellow Emperor’s and Lao’s teachings
to reveal their harmony,
and then the principle became clear.

Thus, the Great Master [参] examined myriad principles [万理] and observed,
yet held firm to his own insight [自主其见].
He said: *"Beyond the Grain’s Spirit [谷], there is no echo [响],
then beyond the echo, there is also no Spirit [神]."*

Those who rigidly uphold a single void [一虚] as its meaning,
when extended to its limit,
Lao’s words then speak of the *Unperishing* [不死],
or of *storage* [若存],
all lacking a final resting place [无归宿].
Therefore, he did not dare to follow blindly.

The *Gate of the Mysterious Female* [玄牝之门],
this is called the *Root of Heaven and Earth* [天地根].
All that is termed *Origin* [元],
take the meaning of *profound, dark, and obscure* [窈深暗晦].
*Origin-Virtue* [元德],
*Origin-Sameness* [元同],
*Origin-Viewing* [元览],
and this *Mysterious Female* [玄牝],
all belong to the four categories of *Virtue-Sameness* [德同] and *Viewing-Female* [览牝],
already touching upon the *existent* [有] and thus visible [可见].
Therefore, beyond these four categories [四则之上],
he further deepens into the *obscure* [深晦],
and thus adds *Origin* [元] to explore the *command* [命].
Its *foundation* [宿],
when elevated to its utmost,
the *Miracles of the Nonexistent* [无] are already profound.

Then, discarding the label of *Nonexistent* [无],
and solely designating it as *Mysterious* [玄],
its *image* [象] can be imagined.

The *Female* [牝] is one who *responds without initiating* [应而不唱].
The Grain’s Spirit [谷] that *harbors the echo awaiting sound* [蕴响待声] is exactly this.

If *sound is not stirred* [声苟不感],
then the *echo never emerges* [响终不出],
and thus it can be said to *not act before things* [不为物先].

Only those who are the *mighty and strong of the world* [天下之雄且强],
already knowing this,
and yet can *bow to the Female* [自屈於牝],
have reached the utmost *void* [虚].

Above this *void* [虚],
further adding *Origin* [元],
then the *transformations and changes* [变化] that arise,
are the *source of Heaven and Earth’s birth* [生天生地].

Thus, the previous chapter says: *"The Nameless* [无名] *is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.*
And here, it speaks of the *Root of Heaven and Earth* [天地根].
All this is *probing the ultimate and commanding the initial* [探端命初],
and knowing that the *Nonexistent’s response to stimulation* [无之受感而应]
is the *foundation of all existence* [凡有]—
it *grants the primal command* [命其宗] and *governs their emergence* [司其出].

Continuous yet as if existing [绵绵若存],
its use is not exhausted [用之不勤].
With *form and substance* [有形有质],
it is *visible to the eye* [目可睹] and *graspable by the hand* [手可捉],
so it is called *existing* [存]—
if the Grain’s Spirit [谷] can *respond* [能应],
then it is said to *sequence things* [以为序],
but it is *indistinctly nonexistent* [漠乎其无有],
or if it is said to *not exist* [不存],
then the *echo before ceases* [前响已绝],
and the *sound after strikes* [后声再触],
its response remains unchanged [其应如故].
Therefore, it is spoken of as *existing yet indistinct* [若存].

*Continuous* [绵绵] means merely *holding to connection without cessation* [相属而不绝].
Zhuangzi’s *threshold* [际] is exactly this.
The *threshold* is the *intersection of opposites* [两异之交].
Let us clarify it with the *plainly seen* [易见] four seasons [四序]:
when *spring’s season ends* [春之已季],
it is the *summer’s season about to begin* [夏之欲孟].
The *space between the end and the beginning* [季孟之间] is the *threshold* [际].
There is an *end* [季], then there must be a *beginning* [孟],
but the *Origin-Qi* [元气] never *makes itself into end or beginning* [自为季孟].
Thus, the Listed Child’s words on *eternal return* [命往复]
and saying that its *threshold cannot be exhausted* [际不可终] are correct.

Observing from the *threshold* [际],
what is now called *beginning* [孟]
is the *substitution of what was once called end* [昔名为季].
The *beginning* arises [起], the *end* departs [去],
and thus *summer follows spring’s departure* [夏应春往].

Only those who *establish eternal return to give birth and transform* [制往复以出生化],
have *no threshold and no end* [无际无终],
and this is why they *remain everlasting* [常存].
This *everlasting existence* [存],
though *constant and never perishing* [常不亡],
is *yet unseen* [不可得见],
so it *continuously connects* [绵绵相属],
as if existing yet *no sequence is apparent* [不见其序].
Therefore, it is spoken of as *existing yet indistinct* [若存].

Its *eternal birth and transformation* [生生化化],
never *ceasing or lingering* [无时或息, 无时或留],
as if *laboring greatly* [甚劳],
yet *with sequence in precedence and succession* [先后有序],
though there are *actions and functions* [有作用],
they do not *exhaust movement* [费运动].
*Self-birth, self-transformation* [自生自化],
*self-consumption, self-rest* [自消自息],
there is *no labor at all* [元无劳].

Zhuangzi says:
*"The interplay of yin and yang, the four seasons’ progression,
each attains its order.*
*Awaken! As if perishing yet existing,
effulgent yet formless—its spirit,
all things nurtured yet unaware.*
This is called the *Origin-Root* [本根].
Is this not the *spirit that perishes not* [能神而不亡],
as if *laboring yet truly not exhausted* [若劳而寔不勤]?"

Discussing how the Listed Child’s *birth and transformation* [生化]
originate from Laozi’s *action and return* [作复],
and Laozi’s *action and return*
originate from the *Classic of Changes’* *eclipse and growth* [消息],
yet the *means by which they birth, transform, act, and return* [所以生化作复],
all do not exceed the *advance and retreat of yin and yang* [阴阳之进退].

When *yin retreats and yang advances* [阴退而阳进],
it becomes *birth and action* [为生为作];
when *yin ascends and yang descends* [阴升而阳降],
it becomes *transformation and return* [为化为复].
Speaking of this *gradual advance and retreat* [进退之渐],
it is *eclipse and growth* [消息].

This is what the *Classic of Changes* and Laozi *speak in common* [所同言],
yet Laozi *constantly probes what the Classic does not fully reveal* [探夫《易》之所不肯尽],
and having spoken of it,
he *transcends eclipse and growth to discuss existence and nonexistence* [越消息而言有无].

*Existence and nonexistence* [有无] are again
the *mechanism governing eclipse and growth* [消息之机],
yet not *confined to the cycles of eclipse and growth* [自囿於消息之数].
Thus, the *evidence of action and return* [作复之证] is the *straw-dog* [刍狗];
the *mechanism of eclipse and growth* [消息之机] is the *bellows-key* [橐钥];
and the *source of birth and transformation* [生化之原] is the Grain’s Spirit [谷神].
This is the *distinction between shallow and deep* [浅深之辨].

Zhan Qiu Pu said:
*"The Grain’s Spirit perishes not—its use is not exhausted.*
The *Chapter of the Manifested* [成象] states that all things
are *nurtured by the Grain’s Spirit and Qi* [谷养神气],
thus *eternally born and unperishing* [生生不灭],
this is called *Heaven’s Mysterious Female as Yang* [天主阳为玄],
and *Earth’s Mysterious Female as Yin* [地主阴为牝].
The *Mysterious Female* is the *gate through which all things are born and transformed* [品物生育之门],
this is called the *rooted in Heaven and Earth* [根於天地],
and the *endless generation and manifestation of things* [生物成象无穷]."

Zhang Chong Ying replied:
*"The Grain’s Spirit perishes not—its use is not exhausted.*
I possess this body,
*endowed with Heaven’s Qi* [禀天之气],
and *containing Earth’s essence* [含地之精],
this is the *Spirit of the Five Viscera* [五脏之神].
The *nose* [鼻] is where *Qi’s ascent and descent* [气之升降] are hinged,
the *mouth* [口] is where *essence’s circulation* [精之运行] is linked.
*Qi moves fifty-one times before resting* [气五十一动息],
ascending and descending through the *nose* [鼻].
*Essence circulates seventy-four times in a moment* [精一刻凡七十四运],
circulating through the *mouth* [口].
Thus, the Grain’s Spirit [谷],
*nourished by this essence and Qi* [得此精气所养],
*perishes not* [不死],
this is why it is called the *Mysterious Female* [玄牝故].

The *Gate of the Mysterious Female* [玄牝之门],
is the *nose as Heaven’s Qi’s gate* [鼻为天气之门],
and the *mouth as Earth’s essence’s gate* [口为地精之门].
If *movement is constant* [运动有常],
then the *kidneys do not empty and the seas do not block* [肾不虚海不塞],
and this is the *root of Heaven and Earth* [天地之所以根].
If one can *rest the essence and Qi* [息其精气],
*continuously as normal* [绵绵如常],
using them *endlessly* [用之无穷],
then *longevity will be without end* [享年为无已].
This is the *law of male and female interplay* [男女通行之法],
and it is imperative to *deliberate and nurture it* [详味而养之],
then one will *attain true humanity and sainthood* [成真入圣],
all through this." [皆以之也。]

「If not so, then *essence will be depleted and Qi will be exhausted* [精耗气亏],
and the *Grain’s Spirit* [谷神] will have no nourishment to sustain it—
then the face will lack luster and vitality [颜无光采],
and *Qi will transform into the Yang Male* [气化雄],
*essence into the Yin Female* [精化雌],
*Spirit into the Ghostly* [神化鬼],
which is called the *Three Corpses* [三尸者也].

Humans live in this world,
possessing this wondrous *essence-Qi-Spirit* [此妙],
yet cannot preserve and nurture it.
Alas.

Zhang Lingying said:
*"Xuan* [玄] is Heaven’s domain, the Yang,
and is the *Primordial Qi* [元气].
*The Female* [牝] is Earth’s domain, the Yin,
and is the *Primordial Essence* [元精].
The *Primordial Qi* [元气] ascends at the *Child Hour* [子时],
this is the *birth of one Yang* [一阳生也].
From the *Kidney Palace* [肾宫], it flows through the *Left Path* [左道] into the *Five Zang Organs* [五脏],
and at the *Maocheng Hour* [卯时] meets with *essence* in the abdomen,
entering the *liver*—this is called the *Spring Yang Division* [春阳分也].
By the *Wucheng Hour* [巳时], it reaches the *Heavenly Gate* [天门],
the *nose as the gate for its entry and exit* [鼻为出入之门],
and ascends to the *crown* [顶],
until the *Wuhou* [午时], when it descends, residing in the *Right Path* [右道],
entering the *bone networks* [骨络], then returning to the *Kidney Palace* [肾宫].

The *Primordial Essence* [元精] ascends and descends at the *Wuhou* [午时],
this is the *birth of one Yin* [一阴生也].
From the *Command Essence* [命元], it flows through the *Right Path* [右道] into the *bone networks* [骨络],
and at the *Yousheng Hour* [酉时] meets with *Qi* in the back,
entering the *lung*—this is called the *Autumn Yin Division* [秋阴分也].
By the *Haicheng Hour* [亥时], it reaches the *Earthly Portal* [地户],
the *mouth as the gate for its entry and exit* [口为出入之门],
and ascends to the *crown* [顶],
until the *Child Hour* [子时], when it descends, residing in the *Left Path* [左道],
entering the *Five Zang Organs* [五脏], then returning to the *Command Essence* [命元].

When *essence ascends and Qi descends* [精与气一升一降],
the *Mysterious Female* [玄牝] interplays,
neither depleted nor excessive [不亏不盈],
then the *Spirit dwells in Heaven’s Grain* [神居天谷],
guarding and sustaining this form [守卫此形],
and only then can one perceive the *method of regulating and attaining non-death* [调理不死之方].

Bai Yushan said:
*"The Grain’s Spirit does not perish"* [谷神不死],
this is because the *heart is originally without aging and death* [此心本无老死].
This is called the *Mysterious Female* [玄牝],
unified in this *One Dao* [同此一天].
The *Gate of the Mysterious Female* [玄牝之门]
lies where the *mind’s movements arise* [念头动处].

This is called the *root of Heaven and Earth* [天地根],
for it is the *heart* [惟心].
Continuously as if preserved [绵绵若存],
it is simply *this* [只是如此].
Using it without strain [用之不勤],
is to act *without effort* [无为而已].

Liao Cuiran said:
*"The Grain’s Spirit does not perish"* [谷神不死].
*Empty Qi* [空气] within the body is the *mother of Spirit* [神之母],
and the *mother and child mutually nourish* [子母相养],
thus *form and Spirit attain longevity* [形神长生].
This is called the *Mysterious Female* [玄牝],
the *mother of all things* [万物之母].
The *Gate of the Mysterious Female* [玄牝之门]
is the *gate of all transformations and marvels* [生生化化，众妙之门].
This is called the *root of Heaven and Earth* [天地根],
the *source of all phenomena* [万象之本].
Continuously as if preserved [绵绵若存],
*left and right find their origin* [左右逢原],
this is the *original face of suchness* [本来面目之为].
Using it without exertion [用之不动],
it *circulates endlessly without pause* [周行不殆],
extending through ancient and modern times [绵亘古今],
*requiring no effort to consume* [不消用力].

Chen Biuxu said:
*"The Grain’s Spirit does not perish"* [谷神不死]—this is called the *Mysterious Female* [玄牝].
The *Great Person* [大人] takes *Great Emptiness* [太虚] as the *Empty Grain* [空谷],
and *Creation* [造化] as the *Supreme Spirit* [至神].
The *Empty Grain* and *Supreme Spirit* [空谷至神]
are the *body and function of the Dao* [道之体用],
how could there be a principle of *perishing or not perishing* [有死乎不死之理]?
Moreover, it is *deep and hidden* [深冥],
and yet can *mother and nourish*—
thus it is called the *Mysterious Female* [玄牝].
Some say *Grain* [谷] symbolizes *Heaven and Earth* [天地],
and *Spirit* [神] symbolizes the *Great Dao* [大道].
But those who speak of *Grain’s Spirit* as a metaphor for *mountains and valleys echoing in response*—
is this not too trivial?

Furthermore, if humans can *embrace openness without bounds* [怀豁无方],
aligning with the *Great Emptiness’s vastness* [法太虚之广],
and *preserve the true and genuine Spirit* [存任神真],
drawing upon *Creation’s vitality* [资造化之灵],
then *form naturally harmonizes with the Dao* [自然形与道合],
what is there to speak of *death* [何死之谓乎]?
Thus, one *flourishes in hidden cultivation* [冥然茂养],
and *all things receive its blessings* [物受其赐也].」

「Thus it is called the *Mysterious Female* [玄牝]. The *Master of the Yellow River* [河上公] in his *Commentary* [《章句》] explains that *Grain* [谷] refers to the *nourishing sound* [育], meaning *nourishment* [养]. When humans can *nourish their Spirit* [养神], then they do not *perish* [死].

The *Spirit* [神] here refers to the *Spirits of the Five Viscera* [五藏之神]:
- the *Liver Spirit* [肝] harbors the *ethereal soul* [魂],
- the *Lungs Spirit* [肺] harbors the *corporeal soul* [魄],
- the *Heart Spirit* [心] harbors the *Spirit* [神],
- the *Kidneys Spirit* [肾] harbors the *Essence* [精],
- the *Spleen Spirit* [脾] harbors the *Will* [志].

When humans can *cleanse and still their form within the Great Emptiness* [清静虚空], *nourishing their Spirit* [以养其神], and not be *defiled by the myriad desires* [不为诸欲所染], their *form remains whole and their Spirit intact* [使形完神全], and thus they do not *perish* [死]. But if one *entangles with emotions and lingers in indulgence* [触情耽滞], *disturbed by the myriad phenomena* [为诸境所乱], their *form decays and their Spirit departs* [使形残神去], then how can the *Dao* [道] be preserved?

The *Gate of the Mysterious Female* [玄牝之门] is called the *Root of Heaven and Earth* [天地根]. The *Great Emptiness* [太虚] and *Creation* [造化] are the means by which *all things enter and exit* [万类之以出入]. Since there is the name of *entry and exit* [出入], it is called the *Gate* [门]. Moreover, *Root* [根] means *origin* [元], and the *Gate* [之门] refers to the *two nostrils* [两鼻], which serve as the passage for the *Essential Qi of Heaven and Earth* [天地之元气] to circulate within the body.

The earlier statement that *Grain’s Spirit does not perish* [谷神不死] exhorts humans to *the principle of nourishing the Spirit* [养神之理], while this passage on the *Gate of the Mysterious Female* [玄牝之门] illustrates *the technique of refining the form* [炼形之术]. Thus, those who *perfectly nourish both form and Spirit* [形神俱妙] alone may *align with the Dao* [与道同].

Humans possess both *form* [身] and *Spirit* [神], and thus they have *birth and death* [生有死]. With *birth and death* [生有死], one cannot speak of the *Dao* [道]. *Flowing and shifting without constancy* [流动无常], how can it be called *stillness* [静]? If one *empties their form and Spirit* [空其形神], *forgets the distinction between self and things* [忘其物我], then *their exit lacks a root* [出无根], and thus *the Qi does not gather to form life* [气聚不以为生]; *their entry lacks an orifice* [入无窍], and thus *the Qi does not disperse to cause death* [气散不以为死]. Without *life* [生] or *death* [死], this is the *Spirit of Grain* [谷神]. *Birth and death are without constancy* [生死无常], for they are but *floating and shifting things* [浮动之物]. *Deeply hidden and feminine stillness* [幽深雌静], *serene and unmoving* [湛然不动], is what is meant by the *Mysterious Female* [玄牝].

*Continuous as if ever-present* [绵绵若存], yet *its use requires no exertion* [用之不勤]. *Continuous* [绵绵] describes its unending nature—this passage ties together the earlier teachings on *nourishing the Spirit and refining the form* [结上养神炼形之义].

To *nourish the Spirit* [养神] is to attain *profound subtlety and hidden stillness* [深妙冥极], *cleansing and emptiness* [清静虚空], *continuous as if ever-present* [绵绵若存], yet *responding to things without ceasing* [感物而起], *uninterrupted in time* [无有绝时].

To *refine the form* [炼形] is to *breathe in the harmonious Great Emptiness* [呼吸太和], *guide and connect the blood and Qi* [导接血气], *drink the elixir of the endless spring* [饮难终之泉], and *chew the herb of longevity* [咀延年之草], so that *their limbs and joints remain unobstructed* [使其支节通畅] and *they experience no exertion* [而不勤劳]. Only then can they *share the same root as Heaven and Earth* [与天地同根] and *enter the same gate as all marvels* [众妙共门].

*Master Xie Tuonan* [谢图南] says: *The Spirit of Grain does not perish*—this is the *ineffable function’s non-exertion* [至用之不动]. The *Classic* [经] states: *Grain is filled by the One* [谷得一以盈], *Spirit is made agile by the One* [神得一以灵]; *Heaven and Earth possess this* [天地有之], and *humans also possess it* [人亦有之].

*Master Chen Xiyi* [陈希夷] says: *Mountains fall from Heaven’s heights* [山自天之上而坠], so when one *observes the trigram *Kān* [艮] and its lines* [画], one knows *mountains originate from Heaven* [山自天来]. The *human head symbolizes Heaven’s apex* [人之首象天顶], called *Kunlun* [昆仑]. The *nose and mouth are the roots of mountains* [鼻口山根], and the *Spirit dwells between them* [神藏其间], thus it is called *Grain’s Spirit* [谷神], the *master of the body* [一身之主宰]. Indeed, it *never truly perishes* [实未尝死].

The *Mysterious Female* [玄牝] refers to the *Two Primordial Elements* [乾坤二元]. The *head* [首] is *Kān* [乾], the *abdomen* [腹] is *Kūn* [坤]; the *Qi of these two elements ascends and descends, circulating* [二元之气升降往来], called *Mysterious* [玄] when in *Kān* [乾], and *Feminine* [牝] when in *Kūn* [坤]. The *Mysterious Female* [玄牝] is the *Qi of the Two Primordial Elements* [二元之气], and the *Two Primordial Elements* [二元] are the *masters of Grain’s Spirit* [谷神之主].

*Master Shao Kangjie’s* [邵康节] poem states:
*"One thing originally has a body, a body still has a Heaven and Earth"* [一物元来有一身，一身还有一乾坤].
This is precisely what is meant.

The *Gate* [门] refers to the *two nostrils* [两鼻]. The *pure and tranquil Qi of Heaven and Earth* [天地清宁之气] enters through the *human nostrils* [自人之鼻], *circulating and permeating the body* [流布身中]. The *head* [乾首] and *abdomen* [坤腹] are both *nourished by this* [胥此养之], hence it is called the *Root* [根]. The *Qi’s continuous entry* [是气之入], *unending as if ever-present* [绵绵不绝若存], is *preserved by following its natural flow* [顺其自然而存之], requiring *no exertion* [不必劳力].

Thus it is said: *Its use requires no exertion* [用之不勤]. Some may *overclose their Qi* [过於闭其气], which is not only *without benefit* [非徒无益] but also *harmful* [而又害之]. Indeed, it has been discussed: *The Great Ultimate* [太极] *begins to differentiate* [肇分], and humans stand alongside Heaven and Earth as *the Three Talents* [三]. This is the *Dao of the Three Talents* [三才之道].

The *head* [首] is Heaven, the *abdomen* [腹] is Earth, and the *heart* [心] resides between them—*the Three Talents within the human body* [吾身之三才]. *Master Shao Kangjie’s* [康节] poem states:
*"Heaven divides Creation within the One, humans weave the loom from the heart’s apex"* [天向一中分造化，人从心上起经纶].
The *heart* [心] resides between the *head* [首] and *abdomen* [腹], *weaving the threads of the above and below* [以弥纶上下], so that the *Mysterious Female ascends and descends* [使玄牝升降], the *Spirit and Qi circulate* [精神往来], and thus *the body may endure perpetually* [吾身可以常存矣].

When *preservation and nourishment are profound* [存养既深] and *understanding and recognition are mature* [体认既熟], then *it appears vague and indistinct* [惚兮恍兮], yet *therein lies an image* [其中有象], *indistinct and vague* [恍兮惚兮], yet *therein lies a thing* [其中有物], *deep and hidden* [窈兮冥兮], yet *therein lies a precision* [其中有精]. These three may be *perceived* [可识].

*It cannot be seen* [视之不见], thus it is called *Yí* [夷];
*it cannot be heard* [听之不闻], thus it is called *Xī* [希];
*it cannot be grasped* [搏之不得], thus it is called *Wēi* [微].
These three may be *imagined* [可想].

*Know its masculine aspect* [知其雄], yet *hold to its feminine aspect* [守其雌];
*know its white* [知其白], yet *hold to its black* [守其黑];
*know its prosperity* [知其荣], yet *hold to its adversity* [守其辱].
These three may be *preserved* [可存].

When one *reverses their gaze inward and inspects* [反观内察], *Heaven and Earth resemble oneself* [天地与我相似]. Is it not true that *The Spirit of Grain does not perish* [谷神不死], and *Master Lao* [老氏] does not *deceive me* [欺我]?

*Master Lin Yinshi* [林鬳斋] says: *The Spirit of Grain does not perish*—this is the *ineffable function’s non-exertion* [至用之不勤]. This section arises from *one practice of cultivation and nourishment* [修养一项功夫之所自出]. *Master Lao’s* [老子] original intent, however, was not *exclusively for cultivation and nourishment* [却不专为修养].

*Essence* [精] is *substantial* [实], *Spirit* [神] is *ethereal* [虚]. *Grain* [谷] refers to *the ethereal* [虚].」

The *Spirit of Grain* [谷神] is the *divine essence within the void* [虚中之神者也]. It is said that *human spirit emerges from the void* [人之神自虚中而出], hence it *endures perpetually without perishing* [故常存而不死].

*Mysterious* [玄] is that which is *remote and boundless* [远而无极者也]. *Feminine* [牝] is that which is *void and unsubstantial* [虚而不实者也]. These two characters merely describe the *void* [虚].

*Heaven and Earth* [天地] arise from this, hence it is called the *root* [根]. *Continuous* [绵绵] conveys the meaning of *unceasing, unbroken* [不已、不绝]. *As if existing* [若存] means *as if present, as if absent* [若有若无]. When applied within the *void and nothingness* [虚无之中], it *endures without labor* [不劳而常存], thus it is said: *void yet unyielding, in motion yet ever emerging* [虚而不屈，动而愈出].

*Master Huì* [晦翁] says: *The most wondrous principle* [至妙之理] contains the *intent of eternal generation* [有生生之意存焉]. This passage is well-phrased, though its meaning leans toward *theories of nourishing life* [养生之论]. Though this chapter may be applied to *cultivation and nourishment* [修养], its original intent was not *exclusively for this purpose* [实不专主是].

*Master Fàn Yīngyuán* [范应元] says: *The Spirit of Grain does not perish*—this is called *the Mysterious Feminine* [是谓玄牝]. *The Spirit of Grain* [谷神] is akin to *void luminosity* [犹言虚灵也]. *Not perishing* [不死] is akin to *boundlessness* [犹言无极也]. *The Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝] speaks of *that which generates all things yet remains unseen in its generation* [言其生物而不见其所以生也]. It is said: *void luminosity, boundlessness*—this is the *feminine principle of generation* [虚灵无极], which is unseen in its generation, hence it is called *mysterious* [玄]. *The Spirit of Grain* [谷神]—*Fù Yì* [傅奕] says it is *profound yet penetrating* [幽而通也].

*Sīmǎ Wēngōng* [司马温公] says: *It is called Grain because it is centrally void* [中虚故曰谷], *it is called Spirit because it is unfathomable* [不测故曰神]. *Sū* [苏] says: *Grain is supremely void yet still retains form* [谷至虚而犹有形], *but the Spirit of Grain is void and formless* [谷神则虚而无形也]. If it is *void and formless*, how could there be *anything to die* [虚而无形尚无有生，安有死邪]? Calling it *the Spirit of Grain* [谷神] speaks of its *virtue* [言其德也]; calling it *the Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝] speaks of its *function* [言其功也]. The *Mysterious Feminine* generates all things yet *remains unseen in its generation* [牝生万物而谓之玄], how could one see its generation without seeing *how it generates* [焉见其生之而不见其所以生也]?

*The Gate of the Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝之门] is called *the root of Heaven and Earth* [是谓天地根]. *Gate* [门] refers to *yin and yang* [指阴阳也]. It is said that *one opening, one closing*—*endless coming and going* [以其一辟一阖，往来不穷而言也]. *Yin and yang* [阴阳者] are spoken of in terms of *the Dao’s motion and stillness* [以道之动静而言也]. When in motion, it is called *yang* [动而曰阳]; when motion reaches its extreme and stillness ensues, it is called *yin* [动极而静曰阴]. Motion reaching its extreme turns to stillness, stillness reaching its extreme turns back to motion—*opening and closing without error* [动极而静，静极复动，开阖不忒], *generation and nurture without end* [生育无穷]. *Root* [根] means *Heaven and Earth originate from this* [谓天地本於此也].

If a person *first attains this in their heart* [人能於此心之初得之], they will know that *the root of Heaven and Earth is a root without root* [天地之根，无根之根也]; *the Gate of the Mysterious Feminine is a gate without gate* [玄牝之门，无门之门也]; *the Spirit of Grain is a spirit without spirit* [谷神，不神之神也]. How could it ever be exhausted?

*Continuous, as if existing* [绵绵若存], *used without exertion* [用之不勤]. It is said that *the Spirit of Grain in Heaven and Earth is continuous and boundless* [谓谷神之在天地，绵绵密密而无极也]. Yet *it cannot be seen when viewed* [然视之不可见], *cannot be heard when listened to* [听之不得闻], *cannot be exhausted when used* [用之不可既], hence it is said: *as if existing*—*Heaven and Earth use it, and the four seasons proceed, all things flourish, yet they never labor* [故曰若存，天地用之而四时行、百物生，未尝劳也]. The *Spirit of Grain in humans* [谷神在人] is likewise.

*Continuous and boundless* [绵绵密密], *eternally generating* [生生无穷], *as its origin*—who could claim dominion over this body? *As its origin*—where could it ultimately reside? Hence it is said: *as if existing* [故曰若存]. Those who *skillfully use it* [善用之者] *never labor* [未尝劳也], how could it ever be exhausted? This chapter should be *profoundly understood* [宜深体之]. Some may interpret it *exclusively for cultivation and nourishment* [或有专就修养上解者], yet one must *first recognize the Spirit of Grain* [然必须认得谷神方可].

*Xuē Yōngzhāi* [薛庸斋] says: *The Spirit of Grain does not perish*—this is called *the root of Heaven and Earth* [至是谓天地根]. *Grain* [谷] is where *the spirit resides* [神所居]. *Spirit* [神] is what *the form carries* [形所载]. *Nourishing the form to vitalize the qi, containing the qi to harbor the spirit*—this is the *Way of non-perishing* [以形养气，以气含神，不死之道也]. *Spirit inherently does not perish* [神本无死], yet when *assigned to form, it has death* [赋于形而有死], though even in death it *has not truly died* [虽死而未尝死也]. The *Spirit of Grain* [谷神] *does not perish because of the Mysterious Feminine* [因玄牝不死], and *Heaven and Earth take the Mysterious Feminine as their root* [天地以玄牝为根].

*The Mysterious Feminine* [玄牝] is *internal* [内焉], yet *harbors essence externally* [而藏精外焉], *adjusting breath*—*one opening, one closing* [而调息一开一阖], *one exhalation, one inhalation* [一呼一吸]. Exhaling reaches *the deep root* [呼则至於深根], inhaling reaches *the firm base* [吸则至於固蒂]. Thus *the spirit enters* [于是有神入焉], *revolving through the Dipper* [离斗辗历天廷], *riding the sun and moon, parting clouds and mists* [骑日月披云雾], *soaring and returning to the Hall of Great Possession* [腾腾乎会归于大有之室], much like the *divine beings dwelling on Mount Gūshè* [亦犹姑射山有神人居焉].

*Continuous, as if existing* [绵绵若存], *used without exertion* [用之不勤]. *Continuous* [绵绵] means *adjusting breath as if present, as if absent* [调息似有若无], *its use requires no labor* [用之要不至勤劳尔].

*Xiū Xiū’ān* [休休庵] says: *The Spirit of Grain does not perish*—*used without exertion* [至用之不勤]. *Void and luminous* [虚明] is called *Grain* [谓之谷], *subtle and wondrous* [灵妙] is called *Spirit* [谓之神]. *Void, luminous, subtle, and wondrous without end* [虚明灵妙无穷] is called *not perishing* [谓之不死], which is the *Mysterious Feminine* [即玄牝也]. *Mysterious* [玄] is the *Great Dao* [大道也]. *Feminine* [牝] is the *Mother* [母也]. *One vital breath* [一气] *generates within the void and luminosity* [生於虚明之中], then *clears and turbid divide to establish Heaven and Earth* [然后分清浊立天地], hence it is said: *The Gate of the Mysterious Feminine is the root of Heaven and Earth* [故云玄牝之门，是谓天地根].

*The wondrous Dao acts without action* [妙道无为], *one vital breath runs unceasingly* [一气运行不绝], hence it is called *continuous, as if existing* [是谓绵绵若存]. *Responding to the times, adapting to circumstances* [应时应机], *benefiting life and aiding all things* [利生济物], *accomplished without labor* [不劳而办], hence it is said: *not exerting* [故云不劝].

*Void, luminous, subtle, and wondrous* [虚明灵妙] in humans is called *heart* [在人曰心]. The *heart is sovereign over all phenomena* [心为万法王], capable of *generating Heaven and Earth, running the sun and moon* [能生育天地，运行日月], *wondrous mechanisms and marvelous functions* [玄机妙用], *effortlessly boundless* [任运无穷], *responding to circumstances and sensations* [随缘应感], *accomplished without labor* [不劳而办]. Those who *awaken and clarify* [悟明者] *understand without being told* [不言而知已].

*Zhù Bóxìu* [褚伯秀] says: *The Spirit of Grain does not perish*—*used without exertion* [谷神不死至用之不勤]. *Grain is void yet responsive* [谷虚而善应], *Spirit is luminous yet boundless* [神灵而无方]. If a person *harbors the most luminous essence within the most void place* [人能以至灵之物藏至虚之所], then *they respond to sensations without trace* [则随感而应]. *Response leaves no mark* [应已无迹], *life does not even know its own generation* [生尚不知], *how could death exist* [死乎何有]?

*Mysterious* [玄] refers to *the Dao’s profound, unfathomable nature* [道妙难测], *Feminine* [牝] is *the realm of transformation and nurturing* [化育之地]. Its *function* [其为用也] *is wondrous in generating all things yet eternally generates* [妙万物而能生生], hence it is called *not perishing* [是之谓不死].

This elucidates *the Way of void-hearted spirit-nourishment* [此发明虚心养神之道], borrowing *Heaven and Earth’s creative transformation* [借天地造化为言], beginning with *void-heartedness and yielding to transformation* [始於虚心而任化], ending with *effortless self-transformation* [终於无心而化自己出]. All things’ generation *originates from this* [凡物之生，本莫不由斯], hence it is called *Gate* [故称门焉].

*Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子] says: *The Heavenly Gate* [天门者]—*there is no such thing* [无有也]—*all things emerge from non-being* [二万物出於无有]. In terms of the *Yì* [《易》], this is the *Tàijí* [太极]; in terms of humans, this is *nature* [以人言即性].

The beginning is the *one source* [一化] *awaiting transformation*, the *gathering place of myriad principles and myriad things* [万理众甫之都会].

If each person possesses it fully yet ignores its pursuit, then *the Valley* [谷] *is not truly the Valley*, *the Spirit* [神] *does not manifest itself as Spirit*—how can one relate to Heaven and Earth, to all things?

The *form* [形] *nourishes life*, *the contained qi* [含气] *nourishes life*, and *the primordial spirit* [元神] *nourishes life*.
When these three are regulated and abide, the *Dao flourishes* [生道昌].
Within the body, the *Void-hearted Mother* [身中玄牝] is seen.

Continuously guarding it without loss,
like preserving something in the realm of *faint and elusive* [恍惚],
then what movement could there be?

This chapter’s words are *concise yet profound* [语简意深],
akin to *Mencius* [孟子] discussing the *浩然* [浩然] *qi of righteousness*—
it manifests only after cultivation within the person,
permeating the body as the *Dao itself*.
Those who awaken grasp it naturally;
it cannot be fully exhausted by mere words.

Earlier masters, discussing *Dao* from beyond the orthodox [方外],
often elaborated its *refined essence* [精] yet neglected its *coarse manifestations* [粗],
achieving *transcendence* [上达] but lacking *foundational study* [下学].

*Huǐnyuán* [混元] placed this chapter after *Beauty and Evil, Virtue and Wealth, and the Keys to the Mysteries* [美恶贤货橐钥],
unifying them without separation,
but its language is *profoundly abstruse* [玄奥],
so scholars fear its *height and distance* [高远] and dare not approach it directly.

Now, without heeding my own *shallow inadequacy* [浅陋],
I presume to sketch beyond the shadow—
*the Valley-Spirit* [谷神] *is akin to the Non-ultimate* [无极],
the *Void-hearted Mother* [玄牝] *is akin to the Tàijí* [太极].
The *continuous method* [绵绵] *mirrors the Tàijí’s* [太极] *pervasive diffusion* [氤氲布化],
giving rise to an unceasing *Dao* [生道不息].

*The Valley* [谷] refers to its *substance* [体],
the *Void-hearted Mother* [玄牝] to its *transformation* [化],
and *continuous* [绵绵] to its *application* [用].
If one can *inwardly seek it within oneself* [反求诸身],
then self-transformation is achieved.

The *root of Heaven and Earth* [天地之根] is *implied without words* [不言而喻].
In the present age, those who practice *life-nourishment* [养生家],
their teachings also center on *Valley-Spirit and Void-hearted Mother* [谷神玄牝],
yet they fixate on *physical form and material essence* [形质],
extracting it from the *kidneys and heart* [心肾], or from *breathing through mouth and nose* [口鼻呼吸].
These are but *later Heaven’s crude residues* [土苴] after all.

As for the *root of Heaven and Earth* [天地之根] and the *origin of myriad things* [万物宗],
they are abandoned and not explored—
how can they illuminate the *wondrous essence of Valley-Spirit* [谷神之妙]?

According to *The Liezi* [《列子》], it cites *The Yellow Emperor’s Book* [《黄帝书》],
which preserves this chapter entirely.
Evidently, these words existed in antiquity,
and *Huǐnyuán* [混元] merely *recounted them without original composition* [述而不作].

*Niú Miào* [牛妙]’s transmission states:
*The Valley-Spirit does not perish* [谷神不死], hence it is called *Void-hearted Mother* [玄牝].
*The Valley* [谷] is *nourishment* [养].
*Spirit* [神] is one of the *three highest elixirs* [上药三品] in the *Daoist canon*.
*The Void-hearted Mother* [玄牝] refers to the *two nostrils* [鼻之左右孔].

Thus, *great cultivators* [大修行人] practice the *method of fetal breathing* [胎息法],
from *external Void-hearted Mother* [外玄牝] to *internal Void-hearted Mother* [内玄牝],
guiding and drawing the *true qi of Supreme Harmony* [太和真气],
focusing intent on the *elixir field* [丹田].
With prolonged practice,
their bodies endure eternally—
hence it is said, *the Valley-Spirit does not perish* [谷神不死].

*The Jade Purity Fetal Essence Inner Nourishment Classic* [《玉清胎元内养经》] states:
*The wondrous Dao of the Fetal Essence* [胎元妙道],
uniting *external Void-hearted Mother* [外玄牝] with *internal Void-hearted Mother* [内玄牝],
supplementing *external true spirit* [外真神] with *internal true qi* [内真气],
gathering *Heaven’s myriad treasures* [天之万宝] and *my own fetal essence* [我胎之元精],
so that *spirit is born from the fetus* [神生於胎],
*qi clings to the spirit* [气恋於神],
the *heart-sovereign* [心君] *governs in concealment* [潜御],
*breathing is smooth and even* [气息调匀],
*continuous as if preserved yet never ceasing* [绵绵若存而不息],
*endless in its application yet manifesting its efficacy* [用之不穷而见功].
*The Valley-Spirit does not perish* [谷神不死] is the *union with my true origin* [合我真宗].
This is the meaning.

The **Gate of the Mysterious Female**—this is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.

Now, the discourse on the Mysterious Female has **inner and outer** aspects. The **outer** has already been explained above; the **inner** is a **mouth-to-mouth transmitted** secret, not recorded in texts. Thus, Zhang Pingzhong’s *Awakening to the True* [《悟真篇》] states:

*The Mysterious Female*—
not the heart, not the kidneys,
not the liver, not the lungs,
not the spleen, not the Triple Burner,
not the bladder, not the elixir field [丹田].

Then what is it?
It is further said:
*The True Mysterious Female, the Mysterious True Female*—
all converge at a single orifice.

Yet this profound principle,
without an enlightened teacher, is difficult to know.

I once read the *Daoist Canon on Cultivation* [《道藏修行论》], which states:
*The Mysterious Female resides between the two kidneys,*
called the **Divine Chamber**—
the **Palace where the Spirit-Sovereigns assemble**,
the **Region where essence and qi intermingle**,
the **Gate of Life**—
thus called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.

For the human body is a **miniature Heaven and Earth**.

Continuous as if preserved yet never ceasing—
this speaks of the **Fetal Breath cultivation method**:
neither strained nor slack,
as if present yet as if absent,
letting the nasal breath flow gently in and out,
without forcing it.
Thus it is said: *its use requires no effort* [用之不勤].

The *Jade Emperor’s Heart-Seal Scripture* [《玉帝心印经》] states:
*The three supreme elixirs*—
**Spirit, Qi, and Essence**.
Vague and indistinct,
dim and obscure,
preserved yet not held,
instantly perfected.

The **cyclic winds merge**—
in a hundred days, the **Spirit becomes luminous**.
Entering and exiting the **Mysterious Female**,
as if absent yet as if present,
endlessly unbroken,
firmly rooted—
each person has their **essence**,
and when essence is perfected, **spirit is born**.

When spirit unites with **qi**, and **qi unites with the body’s true nature**,
spirit depends on qi to manifest,
essence depends on qi to flourish.
When gathered, it exists;
when scattered, it dissipates.

The three elixirs share one principle—
wondrous beyond words.
Obtain it once, and it is eternal—
naturally, the body becomes light.
The **Great Harmony** overflows,
bones transmute into **frosted jade**.

This is the meaning.

Yang Zhiren says:
*From "Valley-Spirit does not perish" to "its use requires no effort."*
The **Valley-Spirit**—
this is the **Heavenly Primordial Spirit** [天谷元神].
At the **Hun-Dong’s** [鸿蒙] initial division,
this spirit existed first.
It shares substance with the **Great Void**,
and is born with Heaven and Earth.
When the spirit arrives, life begins;
when the spirit departs, death comes.
Yet life is never truly born,
and death is never truly death.

It is the **Sovereign of Yin and Yang**,
the **Exalted Lord of all Spirits**.
Profound and vast—
without it, the sun and moon cannot shine,
without it, the Five Phases cannot flourish,
without it, all things cannot grow.
Its immortality lies in the **Mysterious Female**.

*Mysterious* is **True Yang**,
*Female* is **True Yin**.
Above, it connects to Heaven;
below, it coils within Earth,
circulating through the **Six Voids**,
without fixed abode above or below.

In the elixir, it is **True Lead and Mercury** [真铅汞];
in the *I Ching*, it is **Kan and Li** [坎离];
in the symbols, it is **Dragon and Tiger**.
When a person cultivates it,
Kan and Li wax and wane within the body,
winds and clouds surge through the **Seven Orifices**,
true *qi* steams and warms without cold or heat,
pure Yang flows and nourishes without birth or death—
this is the **function of the Mysterious Female**.

Moreover, the **Gate**—
this is the **portal of the sun and moon**.
Not the heart or kidneys,
not the mouth or nose,
not the **Cinnabar Field** [泥丸],
not the **elixir field below the navel**,
not the **one-inch circular orifice within the navel**,
not the **double gate between the shoulder blades**,
not the **orifice above the heart**,
nor is it a matter of **closing the breath and forcing it**—
to fixate on these is utterly mistaken.
Why not return to the **Root of Heaven and Earth**?

The *I Ching* says:
*The still and unmoving is sincerity* [诚],
*responding and thus communicating is spirit*—
this is the **Gate of the Mysterious Female**.
*The movement before form takes shape is the subtle*—
this is the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.

Sincerity is refined, thus clear;
spirit responds, thus wondrous;
the subtle is profound, thus mysterious.
Sincerity and subtlety—this is **sagacity**.

Continuous as if preserved yet never ceasing—
its use requires no effort.

Jù Qīngzhōng says:
*From "Valley-Spirit does not perish" to "its use requires no effort."*

The *Book of Laozi* treats **governance and benevolence**,
**cultivating the heart and nurturing nature**,
**breath-work and spirit-refining**—
both coarse and subtle, beginning and end,
all encompassed.
This chapter primarily concerns **cultivation and nourishment**,
and should be harmonized with **Confucian and Daoist texts** for mutual elucidation.

From the **Confucian perspective**:
*Valley* means **emptiness**;
*Spirit* means **the spirit within emptiness**.

From the **Daoist perspective**:
*Valley* is the **Heavenly Valley**;
*Spirit* is the **Primordial Spirit of the body**.
The **Palace where the Primordial Spirit resides**—
its emptiness is like a valley, yet the spirit dwells within—
thus it is called **Valley-Spirit**, the **Cinnabar Field Palace** [泥丸宫].
When the spirit is preserved, life continues;
when the spirit departs, death comes.
The reason the **Valley-Spirit does not perish**
lies in the **Mysterious Female**.

The **Yang Spirit** is *Mysterious*,
the **Yin Breath** is *Female*—
when spirit and breath intermingle,
true essence naturally forms.
Uniting with the **Way**, it enters **neither death nor birth**—
thus: *Valley-Spirit does not perish*—
this is the **Mysterious Female**.

The *Yellow Emperor’s Secret of Yin* [《黄帝阴符经》] states:
*The mouth connects to the five viscera*—
the exhaled breath is **heavy and turbid**, belonging to **Yin**—
called the **Earthly Root**.
*The nose connects to the six bowels*—
the exhaled breath is **light and pure**, belonging to **Yang**—
called the **Heavenly Root**.
The mouth and nose—
the **Yang Spirit and Yin Breath**—
are the **passageways of their coming and going**,
thus called the **Gate of the Mysterious Female**—
this is the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.

The Sage **directs this breath** during **ascent and descent**,
**preserves and refines it** within **inhalation and exhalation**,
continuously, without interruption.
Preserve it by following its natural course—
over time, the spirit naturally settles,
the breath naturally steadies.
It is never forced or hastened.
Thus it is said: *its use requires no effort*.

The **Confucian and Daoist texts** converge in principle.
Liezi fully cites this chapter, attributing it to the Yellow Emperor,
suggesting Laozi’s words may have had an origin.

Some say the human body contains **one orifice**—
not the mouth or nose,
not the heart or kidneys,
not the **Valley Passage** [谷道]—
yet its essence is difficult to articulate.
Let those who discuss the **Mysterious** deliberate further.

Xū Liùxū says:
*Valley-Spirit does not perish*—
this is the **Mysterious Female**.

The **Valley** takes its emptiness—
the **Spirit’s** words are unfathomable.
*"Not dying"* means it abides eternally.

Speaking of the emptiness within the **Valley**,
within it resides the **Spirit**—
unfathomable in yin and yang,
eternal from ancient times to now.
Thus it is said: *"The Valley-Spirit does not die."*

Because it does not die,
it is called the **Mysterious Female**.
*"Mysterious"* means distant.
*"Female"* means birth.
It speaks of the countless eons since antiquity,
profound and unfathomable,
its principle of generation endless—
thus it is called the **Mysterious Female**.

The **Gate of the Mysterious Female**—
this is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.
*"Gate"* means passage and foundation.
The **Gate of the Mysterious Female**—
from it Heaven and Earth emerge,
from it all things are born—
the very foundation of Heaven and Earth.

Continuous as if preserved,
its use requires no effort.
*"Continuous"* means subtle yet unbroken—
the very body of the **Mysterious Female**.
*"No effort"* is its function—
the **Gate of the Mysterious Female**,
from antiquity to now,
subtle yet unbroken,
though unseen in sight,
its wondrous generative power
manifests as if present—
how could it ever be said to labor?

This chapter, from beginning to end,
speaks only of the **Valley-Spirit**—
the Sage unfolds it thus, how marvelous!
Ah! This **Valley-Spirit**,
from birth to old age,
never for a moment departs from man—
its form, function,
differ not in the slightest.

Those who believe need no further force;
those who grasp it will depart.
If one speculates while alive,
the falcon has already passed beyond Silla.

Li Shifu says:
From *"The Valley-Spirit does not die"* to *"its use requires no effort"*—
*"The Valley-Spirit does not die"* is called the **Mysterious Female**,
for the **Valley** is emptiness—
the great **Valley** of Heaven and Earth,
the small **Valleys** of mountains and marshes.
The **Spirit** is the numinous essence—
the **Spirit** abides in emptiness,
borrowing *qi* to resonate.
Mountains and marshes, though lifeless,
when called, respond with echoes.
My **Spirit** is formless,
relying on *qi* to sound—
undying, eternally preserved.

*"Mysterious"* is the subtle heart.
*"Female"* is the intent of *qi*.
Before the heart’s use manifests,
men do not perceive it—*"Mysterious."*
Before *qi* transforms,
the deed remains unseen—*"Female."*

The **Gate of the Mysterious Female**—
this is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**—
the passage of giving and receiving,
of release and return.
From this single *qi*, the Dao is born;
from this single heart, Heaven, Earth, and all things emerge—
the foundation of all affairs’ mechanisms.

Continuous as if preserved,
its use requires no effort—
unbroken and eternal,
unwaning.
Apply it gently, never forcing,
lest the **Spirit** and *qi* be injured.

Chai Yuangao says:
*"The Valley-Spirit does not die"*—
this is called the **Mysterious Female**.
The **Valley** is emptiness,
*"not dying"* is perpetual wakefulness.
When the myriad thoughts stir,
the root is revealed—
when emptiness prevails, it revives.

The **Gate of the Mysterious Female**—
this is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.
The opening and closing of *Kàn* and *Hūn*.
Continuous as if preserved,
its use requires no effort.
The **True Person’s** breath—
resting on the heels, effortless.
The common man’s breath—
through the throat, labored.
There must be action, yet
the mind must not be fixed,
forget not,
nor force growth—
this is the effortless use.

Is it not the Gate of *Kàn* and *Hūn*?

Su Jingjing says:
From *"The Valley-Spirit does not die"* to *"its use requires no effort"*—
this chapter speaks of nurturing *qi*.
The Master of the Yellow River and Zhang Chong
both took the **Mysterious Female** as the nose and mouth—
the passage for inhaling and exhaling.
*"Root"* means origin.
The nose and mouth are the passageways
through which Heaven and Earth’s primal *qi* circulates.
Continuous and unbroken,
its subtlety is as if nonexistent yet present—
when *qi* is nourished,
its use requires no extra force,
naturally extending life and vision.

Even the Tang Emperor Minghuang,
when the **Valley** responded to sound,
knew not how—
when stimulated, it responded,
as if divine.
In Laozi’s text, the **Valley** is used as metaphor repeatedly:
*"Vast, like the **Valley**,"*
*"The **Valley** that holds One is full,"*
*"Be the **Valley** of the world,"*
*"The rivers and seas can be kings of the **Valleys**,"*
all because of their ability to descend.
Yet here it uniquely says:
*"The Valley-Spirit does not die,"*
*"Continuous as if preserved."*
If one seeks it from its undying, as-if-preserved nature,
descending alone cannot exhaust it.
Only as the Emperor’s responsive echo
can the meaning of *"not dying yet as-if-preserved"* be fully grasped.

Echo and shadow are one—
shadows trace form,
from the sun, moon, water, fire.
But sound’s resonance:
when uttered in the wild, it scatters;
when striking mountains, it is stifled.
Only when sound emerges from an empty **Valley**
does it resonate as if from nothing—
divinely so.
Then one knows that *"not dying yet as-if-preserved"*
is truly without deceit.

The Yellow Emperor said:
When form moves, it does not generate form—
it generates shadow.
When sound moves, it does not generate sound—
it generates resonance.
When the void moves, it does not generate the void—
it generates the existent.

Thus the **Valley’s** ability to manifest as **Spirit** is indeed verifiable.
When it is empty, it is void;
when sound strikes it, it responds—
sensing, it manifests.
This sensing-response is its undying, as-if-preserved **Spirit**.

*"Mysterious"* is subtlety.
*"Female"* is responding without initiating.
The **Valley’s** storing of resonance awaiting sound—
this is *"not initiating."*
If sound does not strike,
the resonance’s response never emerges;
when sound strikes, the resonance responds.
So subtle is its **Spirit**—
thus it is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**.

Heaven and Earth are born from the **Supreme Polarity**,
the **Supreme Polarity** originates from the void,
the void can generate the existent,
the existent is born from the void.
Resonance responds to sound—
the void generating the existent—
if not called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**, why?

The previous chapter speaks of the *Nameless*,
the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
This speaks of the **Root of Heaven and Earth**—
root and beginning are one.

*"Continuous"*—
when the prior resonance fades,
the next sound strikes,
its response remains unchanged.
Thus it is said to *"as-if-preserve"*—
the **Valley-Spirit** does not perish.
If used, the more it is applied,
it seems labored yet truly requires no effort—
move with its emptiness,
with its void.
The void generates the real,
the nonexistent generates the existent—
what else could it be but **Spirit**?

The cultivation of *qi* is but another extension by humans of their own reasoning.

Wu Huanzhong said: *"The Valley-Spirit does not die—its use requires no effort."*

Wu Huanzhong’s disciple, Wu Zhen, remarked: *"The *Laozi* contains hidden Daoist intent—when the spirit is ever-nourished, the *po* does not dissipate, and water and fire harmonize. His words are most unusual."*

I once heard my teacher say: *"The Valley-Spirit is the primordial *qi* of Heaven-before-Heaven. Spirit-*qi* returns to the Mysterious Feminine, and wherever the mind moves, it borrows spirit to act—not through mouth or nose. Mysterious, it is Yang; Feminine, it is Yin—true Yin, true Yang."*

As *Zhuangzi* says: *"All things are born, yet none know their root; they emerge, yet none know their gate. But the source from which Heaven and Earth arise is the Mysterious Feminine."*

The essence of the Great Elixir lies not beyond the spirit, soul, *po*, and intent. Spirit is fire; essence is water—true unity’s essence. The soul is wood; the *po* is metal; intent is earth. The Five Phases cannot be pure without earth, and intent nourishes *qi*. Nourishing *qi* condenses essence; condensing essence awakens spirit. When the Four Symbols harmonize into one, refined practice makes *qi* soft and enduring—unbroken, like thread. Its use requires no effort; day and night, it flows naturally.

Ancient immortals, whether hidden or revealed, spoke of *yin-yang* as substance, likened it to lead and mercury, compared it to sun and moon, modeled it on male and female, likened it to dragon and tiger—*Zhen* and *Dui*, *Kan* and *Li*, gold and cinnabar, *Jia* and *Geng*, *Bing* and *Ren*, *Wu* and *Ji*, water and fire, sovereign and minister, child and mother, infant and maiden, knife and scale, metal and wood, warmth and cold, host and guest, floating and sinking, bathing and rinsing, birth and death, punishment and virtue, battle and retreat, waxing and waning, addition and subtraction, *wen* and *wu*, hot and cold—all these are matters of the Mysterious Feminine. Thus, they established symbols in metaphor, urging one to self-realization: seek it within, not without. Have you not heard the saying: *"The Master of Emptiness and Stillness governs spirit, spirit retains *qi*—no need for external arts to attain longevity?"*

Today’s seekers of the Dao may recognize medicinal herbs but lack the means to apply them. Even if they know where to begin, they fail to grasp the method, wandering lost in the Mysterious Feminine’s domain. Spirit is the root of life; form is the vessel of spirit. When spirit is whole, *qi* is whole; when *qi* is whole, essence is whole; when essence is whole, form is whole; when form is whole, spirit thrives; when spirit thrives, *qi* is refined; when *qi* is refined, spirit transcends. At first, it aligns with the Dao as one. But when spirit is diminished, essence cannot recover; when essence is depleted, the *po* is restless.

You study texts—do you not understand the interplay of things? Yet in waking and sleeping, in seeing, hearing, speaking, and moving, your mind wanders beyond the reach of ears, eyes, heart, and thought. This is what ancient immortals, having cast aside desires and transcended the mundane, achieved only through unyielding resolve. If spirit cannot govern *qi*, and *qi* cannot solidify form, how can one dwell in peace, much less preserve their dwelling? To seek enduring attainment is difficult indeed.

You heard my words, and with a smile of sudden understanding, said nothing.

The teacher then poured wine and sang a chapter from *The Songs of Chu*:

*"The Dao can be received but not transmitted,
Its smallness has no bounds within,
Its greatness knows no limits without.
Without deceit, the spirit is pure—
Then it follows its natural course.
How could it be that *qi* is so refined,
That at midnight, in emptiness, it waits—
Before action, in non-doing’s embrace?"*

With a bow, he departed. On a leisurely day, I composed three stanzas to caution myself:

*"Not all demons are heavy burdens,
Coming forward to speak of foolish dreams.
Xie the Immortal lights the fire with shared intent,
Yangzi’s riverbank watches one *liang* of gold.
When alone, the work is just right—
Concealed, concealed, concealed, yet not difficult.
There are hundreds of green-copper vessels,
Often poured with kind words to quench my thirst.
Rain or no rain, wind or no wind,
Without doubt, without worry, laughter rings warm.
Clustered joy on cinnabar’s earth,
Sealed alone, opened alone."*

And another poem:

*"Do not delay in beginning—
What doubt remains of the Golden Elixir?
A single ball of harmonized *qi*—
Mind the fire’s precision.
When the Four Symbols unite,
Divine insight naturally appears.
To grasp its true mystery,
Observe the lone moon over the pool."*

*—Moon House carving on Stone Pool’s annotation of the* Dao De Jing*, appended by Zhen to this chapter on the Valley-Spirit. Master Wu Zhen’s poem reads:*

*"Do not blame Heaven’s secrets for leaking—
It is because seekers are too bewildered.
Hahaha."*

Master Benyuan said: *"The Valley-Spirit does not die—its use requires no effort. The Valley is empty yet formed; the spirit within it is formless yet present. Mysterious, it is deep yet intangible; as the Feminine, it is void yet substantial. Formless yet present—thus it does not die; void yet substantial—thus it can generate. This too is the body of the Dao.*

*Its emergence is called the Gate; its sustaining root is called the Root. The first chapter speaks of Heaven, Earth, and all things. But here, it does not mention all things—for where there are Heaven and Earth, there are all things. The Root is that which endlessly generates, and thus all things are within it. If one embodies the Dao in the body, unbroken as thread, then the Valley-Spirit and the Mysterious Feminine will reside within you, and the Dao’s use will know no end.*

*Unbroken—neither void nor not-void.
As-if-preserved—neither present nor not-present.
Without effort—without toil.
If one says it is taken from left or right,
It is but returning to its origin.
The *Laozi*’s intent is, broadly, to trace the Dao’s mystery back to Heaven—Heaven and Earth’s beginning—and then reflect it within the self, embodying and preserving it. Mencius’ *xiao-hua cun-shen* is akin to the Valley-Spirit. The Buddhist *zhēnkōng miǎoyǒu* aligns with the Mysterious Feminine."*

「绵绵若存，则释氏之无作止任灭，孟子之勿正勿忘勿助长，而必有事焉者也。 *《拾遗》*秉文曰：此章言道无为无形，生天生地，自古以固存。 河上公曰玄牝为口鼻，养生者尚之。 何其小哉。

*《诸子旁证》*：*《列子》*其言曰：有生不生，有化不化，不生者能生生，不化者能化化。 生者不能不生，化者不能不化，故常生常化。 常生常化者，无时不生，无时不化，阴阳尔，四时尔。 不生者疑独，不化者往复。 往复，其际不可终。 疑独，其道不可穷。

*《黄帝书》*曰：谷神不死，是谓玄牝。 玄牝之门，是谓天地之根。 绵绵若存，用之不动。 故生物者不生，化物者不化。 自生自化，自形自色，自智自力，自消自息，谓之生化、形色、智力、消息者，非也。

石潭曰：谷神不死，是谓玄牝。 此段有两说。
有以谷神为谷虚之生响若有神者，此以理言也。
有以谷神为天谷之神，谓吾身之神居於天谷中者，此以气言也。
虽若两说，其实一也。 何则？
虚中之神，此道也。 天谷中之神，亦此道也。
虚谷之神与吾身之神同出於道，安有异哉？

玄牝二字，有以牝为物之所生而不见其所以生之者，故以玄言。
盖因*《列子》*之引*《黄帝书》*谓此为天地之能生生者言之也。
有以玄牝为吾身之玄牝者，即修养家所指者。
是知以理言之，则空谷之有响，斯答寂然不动，感而遂通，而声之出者常在是。
盖能生而不见其所以生也，故曰谷神不死，是谓玄牝。
若以吾身之神居天谷者言之，则天谷之神所以不死者，以玄牝有以生之也。

玄牝之门，是谓天地根。
玄牝之门，是谓天地根。
二说不同。
以理言之，则程泰之之说是也。
若以吾身之玄牝言之，则有以人之二肾为玄牝者，有以二肾之间为玄牝者，有以口鼻为玄牝者，有以鼻二窍为玄牝者。
要之，二肾之间之说近之。
口鼻乃玄牝出入之门，通乎天地之气者也。

绵绵若存，用之不勤。
以理言之，则绵绵若存者，天地之气生生不已，未尝间断，绵绵不绝，以其不绝，故曰绵绵若存，用之不勤。
以不见其逃，故曰若存。
用之不勤者，用之不劳也。
若以人身之玄牝言之，则玄牝之门，天地之气，往来乎鼻息之间，使之绵绵不绝，存若不存，息微气定则上通天谷，通玄牝，而谷神常不死矣。
用之不勤者，常宽舒而不当急迫勤劳也。

**Chapter on Eternal Heaven and Earth (天长地久章)**

*Considerations of Differences (考异):*
The River Upper Master (河上公) composed *The Chapter of Concealing Brilliance (韬光章)*, while Zhao Shizhan (赵实庵) titled it *The Chapter on Eternal Generation Without Generation (生生不生义章)*.

Emperor Ming of Tang (唐明皇) commented:
In the previous chapter, the **Daoist Mystery of the Eternal Valley Spirit (谷神不死)** was illuminated through its hollow response—this hollow response is the very **unexhausted source**. This chapter elucidates the **impartiality of Heaven and Earth**, for their impartiality is why they endure eternally. It begins by setting forth Heaven and Earth as an analogy, then proceeds to cite the Sage (圣人) to further clarify, concluding with the principle that impartiality fulfills private ends, urging diligence in this practice.

Du Guangting (杜光庭) remarked:
The previous chapter expounded upon the **Daoist Mystery of the Eternal Valley Spirit**, illustrating how Heaven and Earth **nurture qi** through natural spontaneity. This chapter emphasizes **Eternal Heaven and Earth (天长地久)**, aligning with the **practice of natural spontaneity**. The Sage, too, by **applying the Way with impartiality**, ensures that all things converge—thus attaining **harmony and national tranquility**. Heaven and Earth endure eternally because they **do not selfishly assert their own generation**; the Sage **abandons his own self** while his self persists, and **sets aside his own self** while his self remains. Is this not because of their **impartiality**? Thus, they fulfill their **private ends**.

*Considerations of Differences (考异):*
The River Upper Master (河上公) and Yan Junping (严君平) originally read, *"Is this not because of their **impartiality**?"* (非以其无私邪), but Wang Bi’s (王弼) ancient version read, *"Is this not because of their **lack of impartiality**?"* (不以其无私邪). The Kaiyuan Imperial Edition (开元御本) restored it to *"Is this not because of their **impartiality**?"* (非以其无私邪).

The River Upper Master (河上公) said:
**Eternal Heaven and Earth (天长地久)**—this expounds upon the **longevity of Heaven and Earth**, serving as a metaphor for instruction. Heaven and Earth endure eternally because they **do not selfishly assert their own generation**. Their singular capacity to endure long is because they **remain tranquil**, act without expectation of reward, and do not **reside like mortals**, nor **covet private benefits** by seizing others’ blessings. Thus, they attain **eternal longevity**. Since they **do not seek their own generation**, they can **endure without ceasing**.

Therefore, the Sage **abandons his own self**—this is the practice of **prioritizing others before oneself**. Yet his self **persists first**—for the world reveres him foremost, deeming him eternal. He **sets aside his own self**—this is the practice of **neglecting oneself for others**. Yet his self **remains preserved**—for the people love him as a parent, and the spirits nurture him like an infant, so his self **endures perpetually**. Is this not because of their **impartiality**? Thus, they fulfill their **private ends**. What others consider **private** is the **desire to enrich oneself**. The Sage, being impartial, yet **enriches himself**, thus fulfilling his **private ends**.

Wang Fu’s (王辅嗣) commentary:
**Eternal Heaven and Earth (天长地久) because they do not selfishly assert their own generation**—to selfishly assert one’s own generation is to **contend with all things**; not to do so is for all things to **converge naturally**. Thus, they endure eternally and fulfill their **private ends**. **Impartiality** is to **act without selfish regard for oneself**; when one’s self **persists first** and **remains preserved**, it is said that one fulfills their **private ends**.

Emperor Ming of Tang (唐明皇) said:
**Eternal Heaven and Earth (天长地久)**—by setting forth Heaven and Earth’s eternal endurance, it is made clear that **impartiality and lack of desire** lead to **eternal longevity**. The conclusion of the metaphor and its meaning lie in the Sage’s **abandoning and setting aside his own self**, wherein **impartiality fulfills private ends**.

Commentary (疏):
This chapter begins with a **posed question**. Heaven is called **long** because of its **vital qi (气象)**, and Earth is called **durable** because of its **substance and form (形质)**. Heaven and Earth endure eternally because they **do not selfishly assert their own generation**. Their **virtue and power** in nurturing all things are vast, yet they endure long because they **draw from the Dao’s foundation**, not **boasting of their own generative function**.

Commentary (疏):
The opening sentence poses a question; the following is a hypothetical response: *"Heaven and Earth endure eternally because they **cover and nourish all things**, fostering the myriad materials, all of which **draw from the Dao’s foundation**. They do not **boast of their own generative function**, thus their longevity enables them to **generate all things**."* Another interpretation states: *"Not selfishly asserting their own generation"* means that Heaven and Earth **only generate and nourish all things**, without **privately enriching their own existence**. Thus, they attain **eternal longevity**.

Therefore, the Sage **endures while his self persists**—**abandoning his own self** leads others to **delight in promoting him**, so his self **persists first**. **Setting aside his own self** results in **tranquil forgetfulness**, so his self **remains preserved**. Commentary (疏):
Thus, the Sage **imitates Heaven and Earth**, ensuring **equitable coverage** and **nurturing without selfishness**, so he **prioritizes others first**. The people **rejoice and rely upon him**; he is revered by those below, so his self **persists first**. He **does not boast or blame himself**; when the world **converges upon his virtue (仁)**, he faces **no fear or harm**, so his self **remains preserved**.

Is this not because of their **impartiality**? Thus, they fulfill their **private ends**. Heaven and Earth **forget their generative function**, being impartial yet enduring eternally—this is fulfilling their **private ends**. The Sage **abandons and sets aside his own self**, embodying **impartiality**, yet **persists first and remains preserved**—this is fulfilling his **private ends**.

Commentary (疏):
Heaven and Earth endure eternally, and the Sage’s self **persists first and remains preserved**, not because of their **lack of self-interest**, but because of their **impartiality**, thus fulfilling this **eternal longevity** and **prioritized preservation**.

Du Guangting (杜光庭) remarked:
**Eternal Heaven and Earth (天长地久)**—The **Venerable Master Laozi** seeks to elucidate Heaven and Earth’s eternal endurance to instruct the rulers of the world, thus beginning the chapter with his own question. *"Heaven, by its **accumulation of qi (气)**, is called **long**"*—as *Liezi* states: *"Heaven accumulates qi; without qi, there is no qi."* *"Earth, by its **accumulation of matter (块)**, is called **durable**"*—as *Liezi* states: *"Earth accumulates matter; without substance, there is no matter."* **Qi accumulates to form the ethereal (象)**, and **matter accumulates to form the solid (形)**. The *Appendix to the Yijing (易□系辞)* states: *"In Heaven, it manifests as **symbols (象)**; on Earth, it manifests as **forms (形)**."* When **symbols transform above and forms solidify below**, **change and response** are evident, and **prolific generation** ensues.

Heaven and Earth endure eternally because they **do not selfishly assert their own generation**. The **Venerable Master Laozi**, intending to clarify this **eternal principle**, poses the question himself—just as literary scholars invoke **the absent Prince Gong (亡是公子)**, **Mr. Wu You (乌有先生)**, or **the owner of the Eastern Capital (东都主人)** as stylistic conventions.

「Thus, the question is posed and answered by oneself to reveal its meaning. Having already asked in the previous verse—*"Why does Heaven endure and Earth last so long?"*—this one responds: *"Because Heaven and Earth utilize the **Dao/Way's** primordial harmony (运元和) and the **cosmic surge** (冲用) of **qi**, nurturing all existences (群品). Though all existences thrive, Heaven and Earth do not claim their **virtue/power** (德) nor possess their **achievement** (功), and thus they endure eternally.*

*If they claimed their achievement, their **virtue/power** would dwindle; if they possessed their **virtue/power**, it would grow shallow. By not claiming, their **virtue/power** is vast and their **achievement** grand—all things return to their source, and thus Heaven and Earth endure.*

*The sovereign who governs his realm should follow the Dao/Way of Heaven, acting without contrivance (无为), letting all flourish in ease (熙熙). When the people naturally attain peace (平泰), then the nation’s blessings will stretch far, and his own lifespan will extend long—just as Heaven and Earth endure through their lack of selfishness.*

*The sage who cultivates himself avoids laborious schemes and vain pursuits of name, nor does he exhaust his **qi** with ambitious deeds or indulgent desires. His spirit remains tranquil within, his **qi** harmonious within, and thus his nation’s fortune endures, his body thrives—just as Heaven and Earth, without selfishness, endure eternally.*

*Therefore, the sage arrives while his body still lives. In governing the realm, he does not arrogantly seek noble status through action nor burden the people for his own gain—this is what is called **posterity’s body** (后身) and **external body** (外身).*

*The sovereigns of the **Age of Great Clarity** (太古) encompassed the will of Heaven and Earth, their benevolence extending to all under Heaven, yet they were unknown by name. In life, they held no rank, no station; in death, no posthumous title, no record of their deeds. Their substance did not gather, their fame did not stand—yet all under Heaven willingly honored them, and all things joyfully revered them. Truly, they embodied **posterity’s body while their own body led** (后身而身先), **external body while their own body endured** (外身而身存)!*

*But in the world’s decline, such sovereigns no longer exist. Instead, they indulge their own desires, enslaving the people, and drain their strength to serve themselves. The people grow weary, governance falters, and all under Heaven abandons them. This is what is called **losing the way of external and posterity’s body** (失外身后身之道).*

*How much better to discard the **broken jade pillow** (碎琥珀之枕), abandon the **fine furs of the wild goose** (焚雉头之裘), cease the extravagance of a **single grand hall** (罢一台之费), and reject the **thousand-mile horses** (却千里之马)—thus, his **virtue/power** shines through the age, his name gleams on bamboo and silk. The scholar who refines himself does not covet honor or rank—this is **externalizing his body**; he does not rush for advancement—this is **postponing his body**. Thus, his body endures while his **virtue/power** is full; when his **virtue/power** is full, all submit. This is truly **body leading while body endures** (身先身存).*

*To invert this is to stray far from the Dao/Way. Is it not because they lack selfishness that they achieve such greatness?*

*The sage’s cultivation of himself is thus: he aligns with Nature’s transformations, neither monopolizing singular insights nor hoarding his life’s blessings. He does not arrogate his own virtue, nor does he claim precedence over all under Heaven—yet he stands above all, enjoys long fortune, and all people find solace in their hearts, while the uncivilized bow in reverence. Weapons fall silent, ancestral temples stand secure. This is the greatness of his lack of selfishness!*

*For it is because he does not cling to selfishness as selfishness that he attains such brilliance. In cultivating himself, his **virtue/power** is full and all submit; his **Dao/Way** resonates with the divine, his body thrives eternally—this is the greatness of his lack of selfishness! It is also because he does not yield to selfish cravings that he achieves this vast lack of selfishness.*

*The **Scripture of the Spirit Jewel** (灵宝经) says: *"Those who dwell in the world, chasing pleasures and indulging desires, find joy now and suffering later. Why so? Because they reach the extreme of ease and fall into the three abysses (三涂)."* The scholar of the Dao/Way cuts ties with worldly gains, forgets fame, endures cold lodgings, and refines his conduct—ultimately attaining the **Dao/Way of transcendence** (仙道). First suffering, then joy—why? Because he accumulates his deeds and ascends to the **Nine Heavens** (九天).*

*The **Venerable Sovereign of the Dao/Way** (宋道君) said: *"Heaven endures and Earth lasts long because they do so eternally. Heaven’s vault is vast and its station above, with the **celestial axis** (经) as the sun and moon, and the **celestial loom** (纬) as the stars and constellations, sheltering all things beneath. Earth’s foundation is firm and its station below, forming mountains and valleys, blending into rivers and marshes, bearing all things upon it. All things are sheltered and carried by Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth have no concern for them—thus, Heaven moves ceaselessly yet remains steadfast, Earth stands firm yet endures without change, and so they last long and endure.*

*If Heaven and Earth had concern for all things, then Heaven would soon be measured, its sheltering shallow; Earth would soon be fathomed, its bearing thin. If so, they would rely on others—how could they then endure eternally?"*

*Therefore, the sage arrives while his body still lives. Heaven moves above, Earth rests below; the sage stands between them, embodying the **Three Powers** (三才) in harmony, distinguishing the **Three Poles** (三极) in their essence, and uniting the **Three Spirits** (三灵) in their **primordial marvel** (元妙之神). Yet Heaven, Earth, and the sage all attain the Dao/Way. And the sage’s method of governing himself is also that of Heaven and Earth. Hence, this chapter first speaks of Heaven and Earth not asserting their own generation, and then follows with the sage not possessing his own body.*

*All take precedence for themselves, yet the sage alone takes what comes later—saying, *"I bear all under Heaven’s filth"* (受天下之垢), which is called **postponing his body**, meaning he does not contend with others, and thus none can contend with him. Hence it is said: *"Postponing his body, yet his body leads."* He does not vie for perilous advantages nor struggle for ease in winter and summer, nor does he compete for the balance of **yin and yang**. He transcends life and death, abandons fortune and misfortune, and his spirit is never constrained.*

*This is called **externalizing his body while his body endures**. If the sage’s method of governing himself is thus, how much more so for external matters? He encounters them without clinging, passes them without retaining, his nature embracing the spirit, wandering between ancient customs and the present. The people will self-correct, distinctions between self and other dissolve, and he is born before Heaven and Earth yet does not age, enduring beyond the **Age of Great Clarity** (上古) without growing old. This is his effect! Is it not because he lacks selfishness?"*

The sage thus achieves his own ends.

The great **virtue/power** (德) of Heaven and Earth is called **generation** (生), and the great treasure of the sage is called **position** (位). The **Dao/Way** (道) is the public principle by which these are realized. Heaven and Earth embody the **Dao/Way**, hence they lack selfishness; lacking selfishness, they endure long. The sage embodies the **Dao/Way**, hence he lacks selfishness; lacking selfishness, he remains everlasting. To **self-cultivate for private gain** (自营) is selfishness, and none have ever succeeded in their selfishness. Wang Anshi said: Heaven and Earth endure because they can **long-generate** (长生). "Long" refers to their vastness, "durable" to their constancy. Since they do not **self-generate**, they can **long-generate**.

Heaven and Earth endure because they do not **self-generate** but allow all things to generate as they will. Having allowed all things to generate, they can then **long-generate** all things without bearing the burden of **generation** (生). Again, he said: When speaking of Heaven, one says "long"; when speaking of Earth, one says "durable," so it is clear that "durable" is the heavier term. Therefore, the sage arrives yet his body precedes. The sage has no **self** (我), for if he had a self, he would contend with things, and things would draw him into contention. All things oppose the **self** (我). If I do not oppose them, I follow them. **Externalizing his body while his body endures** (外其身而身存). All things burden the **self** (我), but if I do not burden myself with them, I externalize them. Therefore, it is said: **Externalizing his body while his body endures**. Is it not because he lacks selfishness that he can achieve his own ends?

The *Zi Shuo* (《字说》) says: "Self-cultivation for private gain" (自营) is selfishness, and turning one's back on the public is selfishness. Those who **self-cultivate for private gain** (自营) have never succeeded in their selfishness. Therefore, the character for "selfishness" (私) is composed of "self-cultivation" (自营) and does not include the shape of "harm." Hence, Laozi said: It is not because he lacks selfishness that he can achieve his own ends. The character "private" (私) is formed from "禾" (*hé*, grain) and "ㄙ" (*sī*, self-cultivation). Self-cultivation cannot avoid being selfish, but if selfishness does not harm the utility of things, then there is no grievance toward selfishness.

Su Yingbin said: Heaven and Earth endure. Though vast, their endurance is not separate from form and number, so their long-lasting nature is limited. Yet Laozi’s words on endurance extend to Heaven and Earth. This is merely from the perspective of what humans perceive. As for the ultimate endurance, it is what is called the **beginning of Heaven and Earth** (天地始). Heaven and Earth thus achieve their own ends through **long-endurance**. Heaven and Earth generate all things yet do not **self-generate**; they stand outside all things, hence they can **long-generate**. The sage follows his own body yet precedes others; **externalizes his body while his body endures**, benefiting others. He stands apart from the crowd, hence he can both precede and endure.

If Heaven and Earth were to contend with things for **generation**, and if the sage were to compete with others for **virtue/power**, then Heaven and Earth would merely be one thing among many, and the sage merely one person among others. How could this be considered a great transgression? Though they lack selfishness, it is not to seek their own ends that they succeed in achieving them—this is simply the **Dao/Way** as it is. Lü Jiufu said: Heaven and Earth endure because they can **long-generate**. "Long" and "short" refer to form, "durable" and "near" to time. Heaven acts according to time, yet since time is insufficient to describe its form, one speaks of it as "long." Earth acts according to form, yet since form is insufficient to describe its duration, one speaks of it as "durable."

The root of Heaven and Earth lies in the **Dark Mother** (玄牝), and the essence of the **Dark Mother** is established in the **Valley Spirit** (谷神), which is **not-death** (不死). **Not-death** means **not-generation**, and those who do not generate can generate **generation**. This is why Heaven and Earth can endure both long and durable—because they do not **self-generate**, and not **self-generating**, they can **long-generate**. It is as if they were the **Valley Spirit** itself. Therefore, the sage arrives yet his body precedes. The sage does not consider his body as a burden, though it is unavoidable, and nothing can surpass it. **Externalizing his body while his body endures**. He stands in the **non-existence of existence** (无何有), and no thing can harm him, hence it is said: **Externalizing his body while his body endures**. Is it not because he lacks selfishness that he can achieve his own ends?

The body is my own selfishness. To **follow his own body** (后其身) and **externalize his body** (外其身) is to act publicly and without selfishness. Without selfishness, he can achieve his own ends. Lü Nongshi said: Heaven and Earth endure because they can **long-generate**. Those who cling to life do not generate, and those who abandon life do not die. Hence it is said: Heaven and Earth endure. Heaven and Earth endure because they do not **self-generate**, hence they can **long-generate**. Therefore, the sage arrives yet his body endures. The sage is the **harmonious union of Heaven and Earth** (天地之合), and his only task is to **bend himself** (屈己). By this, he first forgets the **self** (我), and thus the **self** (我) is preserved. Hence it is said: The sage arrives yet his body endures. Is it not because he lacks selfishness that he can achieve his own ends?

It is not because he lacks selfishness that he can achieve his own ends. Yet bending himself is easy to forget. Wang Yuanzhe said: Heaven and Earth endure because they can **long-generate**. If one **self-generates**, then one has one’s own **generation**, and having one’s own **generation** means that **generation** is already lost. Only he who does not take **generation** as his standard has never **generated**. **Generation** never **generated**, so though his form may **generate**, it does not bear the burden of **generation**, and thus it is fitting that he endure both long and durable. Heaven and Earth’s not **self-generating** is not for the sake of enduring long and durable—this is simply the **Dao/Way** as it is. What is called "long-durable" is also but a fleeting moment. Only what **covers and sustains** (盖载) without ever failing is its true nature.

Therefore, the sage **follows his own body** yet his body precedes. Though the sage is sage, his form is equal to that of things; only by embodying the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and not contending does he alone differ from the crowd. If he were to establish himself and oppose the crowd, even an ordinary person would be sufficient to overcome him. **Externalizing his body while his body endures**. If he has a **self** (我) and preserves it, then all things become his enemies. Only he who transcends and **self-destroys** (自丧), who does not possess a **self**, can none of the things overturn him. It is not because he lacks selfishness that he achieves his own ends. The sage lacks selfishness because he has never possessed a **self**. If he were to scheme and act thus, then how much more selfish would he be?

Liu Jujie said: Heaven and Earth endure because they can **long-generate**.

「Heaven and Earth endure through their **harmonizing** (燮) and **unity** (和). When things **generate one another** (物物我生), they must inevitably **decay** (衰) and **be consumed** (敝). Only when one does not **self-generate** (不我其生) to fulfill the **principle** (理) of creation does **long-generation** (长生) become possible.

Heaven **accumulates qi** (气), and its fortune lies in **dispersion** (远), hence its association with **length** (长). Earth **accumulates mass** (块), and its fortune lies in **solidity** (固), hence its association with **duration** (久). They do not say **"long-generation"** (久生) because of their **length and duration** (长久).

Though Heaven and Earth **accumulate qi** and **mass**, their **principle** (理) remains unbroken while their **substance** (有) endures—how can one know that Heaven and Earth will ever **be consumed** (坏)? Thus, those who claim **length and duration** (长久) are **deluded** (妄者), for they only **observe substance** (有).

Hence, the sage **embodies** (至) the Dao while his body **endures**. When the sage **aligns with** Heaven and Earth, he **sacrifices his body** (后身), and his body, like theirs, does not **self-generate** (自生). For his body to **generate** (生) and **endure** (存) is akin to **long-generation** (长生). **"Sacrificing his body"** (后身) means **yielding to others** (屈己), and **"externalizing his body"** (外身) means **abandoning the self** (忘我). To **yield to others** (屈己) is to be **subdued by others** (人下之), hence he **takes precedence** (先). To **abandon the self** (忘我) is to **externalize his body** (外其身) while it **endures** (存).

Is it not because he **lacks selfishness** (无私) that he achieves his own ends? **Long-generation** (长生) is not **self-generation** (自生), and **endurance** (存) is not **possession** (有). The sage **sacrifices his body** (后其身) yet does not **take precedence** (先), **externalizes his body** (外其身) yet does not **possess** (有). He **wanders beyond** the dust and filth, **unbound in the realm of non-action** (无为之业), **discarding his frame** (隳支体), **abandoning keen senses** (黜聪明), **separating from form and intelligence** (离形去智), **uniting with the Great Thoroughfare** (大通), and **aligning with the Dao in duration** (与道同久). Thus, his body does not **await precedence** (期先) yet **precedes**, does not **await endurance** (期存) yet **endures**.

Is it not because he **lacks selfishness** (无私) that he achieves his own ends? The sage’s **sacrificing his body** (后其身) and **externalizing his body** (外其身) are **expressed outwardly** (为表) in **gentleness, weakness, and humility** (濡弱谦下), yet **substantiated inwardly** (为实) in **emptiness and non-destruction** (虚空不毁) of all things. Thus, the next section speaks of **"the highest goodness is like water"** (上善若水).

Zhao Shizhang said: The opening presents three causes:
1. **Illustrating the principle of Heaven and Earth’s long-generation**. Heaven is **long**, Earth is **durable**. The Dao **manifests through symbols** (因象显) yet its end is unknown; fire **transmits through fuel** (以薪传) yet its exhaustion is unseen. When things **generate with form** (有象), the Dao **accompanies them**. That which **generates and continually generates** (生而生生) has never truly **generated**; fire **transmits yet becomes illumination** (传而为明), fuel **transforms while fire remains hidden** (薪化而火隐), and the **radiant** (昭昭) has never been **obscured** (昧). Thus, the previous section demonstrates **the Spirit of the Valley does not die** (谷神不死), which is called the **Mysterious Female** (玄牝). The **Gate of the Mysterious Female** (玄牝之门) is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth** (天地根). The **principle of its non-dying governance** (政不死之理) lies in **non-exertion** (不勤).

Continuing with **Heaven and Earth’s long duration**, it takes their **manifestation** (征) as evidence.

2. **Clarifying that self-generation originates from the absence of a fixed heart**. Heaven and Earth’s ability to be **long and durable** (能长且久) comes from the **original qi** (一炁) being **divided into the two polarities** (两仪), and though their **positions** (奠位) differ in **high and low**, they **share the essence of obtaining the One** (同乎得一之灵). Heaven, by **obtaining the One** (得一), is **naturally long** (固自长). Earth, by **obtaining the One** (得一), is **naturally durable** (固自久). **Long** (长) and **durable** (久) share the same **principle** (义) of **unity with the One** (同一体).

Why does Heaven speak of **long** (长), and Earth speak of **durable** (久)? Heaven is described through **qi** (气), hence **long**; Earth is described through **form** (形), hence **durable**. **Clear qi** (清气) ascends, and above it **form emerges** (上有形) while **uniting with the formless** (同乎无形). The **vast and boundless** (苍苍) is its **true color** (正色). **Turbulent qi** (浊气) descends, and below it **substance emerges** (下有气) yet cannot **escape form** (形). The **vastness** (广大) is its **self-sustaining nature** (自任).

Yet Heaven and Earth are **generated by the Dao** (道之所生). The **Great Dao** (大道) is **formless**, and it **nurtures** Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth regard the **formless** (无形) as their **parents** (父母). The **formless** (无形) is **nameless** (无名), and the **nameless** (无名) is the **beginning of Heaven and Earth** (天地之始). To **trace the origin of Heaven and Earth** (原天地之本) is to **receive emptiness in essence** (以虚受性), and to **transform essence into emptiness** (以性化虚)—this is **entering from substance into non-substance** (从有入无). To **transform emptiness into qi** (以虚化气), and to **generate form through qi** (以气生形), is **entering from non-substance into substance** (从无入有).

The **obtaining the One** (得一) refers to the **True Primordial Essence** (真元). The **True Primordial Essence** (真元) is the **Original Qi** (一气). Because the **two qi** (二气) **intermingle harmoniously** (交合) and do not **deviate from constancy** (失於常), they can **generate without end** (生生而不穷). If one were to regard their **intermingling and transformation** (交合变化) as **neither movement nor stillness** (无动无静), then Heaven would have **times of rupture** (有时而裂), and Earth would have **times of eruption** (有时而发). When the **One opens and closes** (一阖一辟), when it **moves and stirs** (一动一静), it **cycles the sun and moon** (运日月) to **divide day and night** (分昼夜), it **varies warmth and coolness** (变温凉) to **determine cold and heat** (定寒暑). All this is **continuous and enduring** (绵绵若存).

Hence, Liezi said: **"The Original Qi does not advance suddenly** (一气不顿进), **and form does not diminish suddenly** (一形不顿亏)—this is its **moderation** (有节)." Is it not because of **reaching the utmost emptiness and nurturing the spirit** (虚极而运神), **deep stillness and focused qi** (静笃而专气), that one can **flow with the Dao** (与道同流)?

Heaven **cycles qi** (以气运), hence its **vaulted expanse** (穹窿) above. Earth **dwells in form** (以形处), hence its **solid bulk** (磅礡) below. This is the **natural position** (自然之位) of Heaven and Earth. **Qian** (乾) embodies **stillness and concentration** (静也专), while **Kun** (坤) embodies **movement and expansion** (动也辟). This is the **natural virtue/power** (自然之德) of Heaven and Earth. To **regard all things as grass and dogs** (刍狗), this is the **natural equity** (自然之公) of Heaven and Earth. To **respond to things with adaptability** (应物), this is the **natural principle** (自然之理) of Heaven and Earth, like the **key of a bellows** (橐钥).」

Yet when Heaven is spoken of in terms of its **cycling**, its motion resides in the center, while the **Six Qi** serve as its functions—movement never lacks stillness within it. When Earth is spoken of in terms of its **dwelling**, it stands firm and unyielding, yet **embracing vastness** as its virtue—stillness never lacks motion within it.

Yet what Heaven and Earth truly **concentrate upon** is **qi**, never upon things. When **qi** is concentrated, things naturally follow—what need is there for the mind?

The **Dao** follows **nature**; Heaven and Earth do likewise. Thus, **life emerges on its own**, and **transformation unfolds on its own**. All things flourish in their own way—**I nurture them yet do not claim them**; all affairs unfold in their own way—**I act yet do not rely upon them**. This is how one abides by the **Dao of enduring life and transformation**.

Thus it is said: *"Heaven and Earth endure long because they do not **self-generate**—thus they attain long life."* The term **"able"** refers to humans in contrast to Heaven and Earth.

How do we know this to be so? Heaven and Earth act without acting, yet nothing remains undone; they possess neither ability nor inability, neither having ability nor lacking it—this refers to humans. To say Heaven and Earth are **"able"** is to say they do not cling to their own life, hence they attain long life. To say humans are **"unable"** is to say they cling to things as their own, hence they lose life. Thus Heaven and Earth endure long—why then speak of **"yet"**?

Among forms, none is greater than Heaven and Earth; among lifespans, none surpasses **Qian** and **Kun**. **"Yet"** means **"yet"** and nothing more. Yet even Heaven and Earth, though vast, when viewed through the **Dao**, do not depart from form. What has form cannot endure forever; what is fated cannot last eternally. At the great cycle’s turn, all must return to decay—yet what has not yet decayed is merely said to **"yet"** endure.

What does not decay is the **nature of Heaven and Earth**; what decays is their **fated measure**. To observe **the worries of the State of Qi**, the answer does not reach this depth.

**Thus, there is no ultimate end.**

Because they do not **self-generate**, they attain long life.
*The Daoist Scripture* says: **"Form stands by the Dao; spirit arises from emptiness."**
Indeed, humans share with Heaven and Earth the same **original qi**, yet cannot endure as they do because they fail to guard it by the **Dao**.

Heaven and Earth naturally **refine the elixir**, with **lead-dragon and mercury-tiger**, **coiled and hidden at co

「Speaking of the Sage’s desire to attain the **Dao/Way of Sageship**, he does not place his own body before others—this is **selfishness**. Yet in his movements and interactions, he never fails to observe the rites of **humility and deference**; others, in turn, regard him as placing theirs first.

This is **acting last yet taking precedence**—could it not be **selfishness**? As for **placing the body externally yet preserving it**, if one does not place the body externally, it will be set in a realm of **desired things**; if **desire overcomes**, harm arises, and harm to the body **injures life**.

Now, those who place their bodies externally do so to **desire their own bodies** yet not to be **ensnared by external things**—only then can they preserve their bodies. To preserve one’s body is to **regard the body as private**.

When the body suffers no harm and thus attains **long preservation**, this is **public virtue**. The Sage’s actions should not be said to be **selfish**, yet when he acts with **selfishness**, it is because at their origin he did not dare speak of them openly—thus they are called **"deviant"**.

**"Deviant"** means **doubtful and seemingly contradictory**. The **Scripture** points to the Sage’s **selfishness**, saying: *"Is it not because he lacks selfishness that he attains public virtue?"* Do not say the Sage lacks selfishness; it is **through selfishness that he achieves public virtue**.

Thus, the term **"deviant"** refers to **placing the body last and externally** to attain selfishness. **Xu You** did not accept the name **"Non-Action"**—this was placing his body last, and Xu You attained his selfishness. **Bao Shu** had the **principle of sharing wealth**—this was placing his body externally, and Bao Shu attained his public virtue.

Yet, the **Dao/Way of selfishness** in Heaven and Earth lies in their **not self-generating**—who then knows how the **Dao** makes this **public virtue**?

**Shao Ruo Qu** said: *"Heaven and Earth endure long and last because they attain selfishness."* Heaven and Earth endure long and last, yet they do not know of **rainbow transformations** or **misty vapors**; winds and rains follow the four seasons, and **accumulated qi** forms Heaven. Mountains and rivers, seas and lakes, metals and stones, grasses and woods—**accumulated forms** constitute Earth.

What has form, how could it not decay? Heaven and Earth endure long and last because the **cyclical movements of the seasons** follow the **Dao/Way** as the **master of life and transformation**; Heaven and Earth, not self-generating, thus attain **long life**.

Therefore, the Sage imitates them, dwelling in **humility and deference** yet never **self-exalting**. Placing his body last, his body is yet **regarded by others as first**; considering all worldly benefits as **external to the body**, he does not let them **burden him**, and thus his body is preserved for long.

The Sage’s **placing his body last** and **externally**—is it not because he has **selfishness**? He imitates Heaven and Earth in their **action-yet-non-action**, thus attaining his selfishness.

**Wang Zhi Ran** said: *"Heaven and Earth endure long and last because they attain selfishness."* The **Dao/Way** permeates the **Four Great Elements**—within the Four Great Elements, those who attain the **Dao** and thus become great, none greater than Heaven, Earth, and the Sage.

Heaven attains **One** to become **clear and pure**, its **vaulted dome** positioned **above**, its **body** as **Qian**—**unyielding, vigorous, and upright**, all things **begin from it**, **steady yet eternally in motion**. **Zhuangzi** said: *"The **Dao/Way of Heaven** moves yet **accumulates nothing**."* The *I Ching* says: *"It **simplifies** for people."*

Earth attains **One** to become **tranquil and enduring**, its **vast expanse** positioned **below**, its **constancy** as **Kun**—**receptive and enduring**, it **supports Heaven and nourishes all**, all things **find life from it**, **relaxed yet eternally at rest**. **Zhuangzi** said: *"The **Dao/Way of Earth** moves yet **accumulates nothing**."* The *I Ching* says: *"It **simplifies** for people."*

In speaking of Heaven and Earth, this is **complete**. **Qian** is the **symbol of Heaven**, **Kun** the **symbol of Earth**. When **Qian** is **still**, its **specialization** is complete; when it moves, it is **direct**—thus **great life** arises. When **Kun** is **still**, its **gathering** is **concentrated**; when it moves, it **expands**—thus **broad life** arises.

Therefore, Heaven attains this to **endure in clarity**, Earth attains this to **endure in tranquility**. Heaven and Earth having attained the **most simple and easy Dao/Way**, thus **survive through vast calamities** and **endure eternally**, spanning **ten thousand ages** without decay.

Yet what **Laozi** called *"Heaven and Earth enduring long"* was because they **do not self-generate**, thus they attain **long life**. To compare the Sage to Heaven and Earth—though Heaven and Earth endure long and last, their **origin is rooted in the subtle and natural essence of True One**, sharing **the same body as the Dao**, thus they **cover and load all things**, **endure and nourish all things**, **complete and perfect all things**, **guide and transform the four seasons**, their **movements and measures are boundless**—in **life**, they **store and accumulate**; in **endurance**, they **lengthen and cultivate**; in **completion**, they **perfect and ripen**; in **nourishment**, they **cover and sustain**, never once **inviting the mind**, yet **effortlessly fulfilled**, never **claiming ownership of their actions**.

Even when they give life, they do not know **how they give life**. The Sage embodies Heaven and Earth’s **creative transformations**, yet **resides in the middle**, **harmonizing the Three Powers**, **discerning the Three Poles**, **uniting the Three Spirits**, **gazing upon the world below without duality**, always **taking the hearts of the people as his own**, while the people **look up to the Sage without two Daos**, always **taking the Sage’s Dao/Way as their own**.

The world **governs itself without action**. The Sage, when **forced to govern** the **State of Qi**, never **placed his body before others** though his body was yet **regarded as first**; he **externally placed his body** yet never **prioritized external things**, and the people **joyfully followed him without wearying**. As in the *Book of Poetry*: *"From the east and from the west, from the south and from the north, none do not submit without thought."*

Ah! The **greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth** is **generation**; the **greatest treasure of the Sage** is **position**. Heaven **covers without selfishness**; Earth **loads without selfishness**. Yet Heaven can **cover** but not **load**, Earth can **load** but not **cover**—this is also **Heaven and Earth’s incomplete virtue**.

Observing this from a **human perspective**, Heaven and Earth endure long and last—**indeed, they cannot be imitated or reasoned with**. Observing this from the **Dao/Way**, Heaven and Earth’s endurance is thus, yet it is **but a fleeting moment**.

Thus, the Sage is **not a talent born in every age**; he **harbors the potential for great action**, **public yet without selfishness**, **humble to preserve himself**, **wandering in the world’s joys and sorrows**, **sharing breath with the people**, continuing with the Sage’s **not self-possessing his body**.

Is this **indeed selfishness**? Or **indeed without selfishness**? **Zhuangzi** said: *"Non-Action and no form are like without selfishness; emotions and trust are like with selfishness."* Thus it is said: *"Is it not because he lacks selfishness?"»

「Thus, it is precisely because he can fulfill his own selfishness. What do the learned say of this?

Huang Maocai said: *"Heaven and Earth endure long because they can fulfill their own selfishness."* All things draw upon Heaven and Earth to be born, yet Heaven and Earth never truly give birth to them. Humans give birth to humans, beasts to beasts, birds to birds, fish to fish, grasses and trees to grasses and trees—what part do Heaven and Earth play in this? The **Dao/Way of eternal generation** does not itself generate; thus all things undergo **transformation and renewal** while it remains unending.

That which does not generate does not die; thus Heaven and Earth endure without ceasing. If a person can align with Heaven and Earth, why should he not attain **long life**?

Therefore, the Sage **preserves his body while fulfilling his virtue/power**. To **postpone one’s body** is the means to **conduct oneself in the world**; to **transcend one’s body** is the means to **embody the Dao/Way**. Now, if a person **humble and modest**, **retreating from worldly affairs**, is **praised by his neighbors** and **honored by the court**, then to **discard form and abandon wisdom**, **forsaking the world to stand alone**, he must indeed be able to **endure long**—this is clear.

Is it not because he lacks selfishness? Thus he can fulfill his own selfishness. Heaven **covers without selfishness**, Earth **bears without selfishness**; the Sage **unites with Heaven and Earth in virtue/power**, and while all others perish, he alone survives. While all else wither, he alone thrives—is this not the fulfillment of his selfishness?

Cheng Taizhi said: *"Heaven and Earth endure long because they can fulfill their own selfishness."* The later chapter states that humans can attain **long life and prolonged vision** because they **harness the years** and **make them eternal**. But if Heaven and Earth’s **eternal generation**, what does it mean to speak of **long years**?

The *I Ching* says: *"Eternal generation is called the **Dao/Way**."* It is the **source of generation** that gives birth, and the **Dao/Way** that further generates from it—this is called **eternal generation**. Extending this analogy, the **crawfish (生)**, the **elderly (耆)**, and the **great enterprise (大业)**—all that is called **generation** refers to **augmenting what is not yet present**.

Heaven and Earth do not generate themselves yet can **prolong this generation eternally**; this aligns with *Liezi*’s claim: *"The **Dao/Way of eternal generation** does not generate itself, for its **Dao/Way is unfathomable**."* This is precisely the elaboration of that principle.

All things under Heaven are born from **substance (有)**, and **substance** arises from **non-substance (无)**. Heaven and Earth’s ability to generate all things stems from their **constant presence**, yet they never **enter into generation themselves**. Vast and decaying, they **bestow their qi** upon countless varieties, forming them.

Heaven and Earth, however, **do not increase** over the ages—thus all they possess is **without loss**, all they grant is **without destruction**. Hence, they can **generate all things under Heaven** yet **never exhaust themselves**.

*Liezi* further says: *"That which is generated from generation dies, yet the **Dao/Way of eternal generation** never ends. That which takes form from form solidifies, yet the **Dao/Way of formless transformation** never remains."* This is the ultimate extension of that principle.

Therefore, the Sage **preserves his body while fulfilling his virtue/power**. The later chapter indeed clarifies this principle, saying: *"The Sage desires to surpass others by his words, yet he acts beneath them; desires to precede others by his actions, yet his body lags behind."* Thus, when he **occupies a high position**, others do not **resent him**; when he **takes the lead**, others do not **harm him**. Hence, the world **delights in pushing him forward without tiring**.

To **postpone one’s body yet have it endure first** is to **sacrifice oneself to benefit others**, and also to **refrain from contention while none can contend with him**. This principle originates from Heaven and Earth’s **not generating themselves** yet **prolonging their generation eternally**. To **transcend one’s body yet preserve it**.

Humans **love their bodies** without distinction—whether noble or base, wise or foolish, all are the same. Yet if they love without **embodying the Dao/Way**, they **seek to benefit yet cause harm**. Laozi says: *"People’s disregard for death is due to their excessive attachment to life."* Meaning they **cherish it so heavily** that they **do not spare themselves** in nurturing it, even to the point of inviting death.

He also says: *"To **augment life** is called **auspicious (祥)**."* Meaning they **exert finite wisdom** to **pursue what life does not inherently possess**, thus **inviting disaster (祸)**. If one **excessively nurtures life** yet **loses the Dao/Way of natural generation**, and **seeks to augment life** through artificial means, then in terms of **loving one’s body**, one can say he **spares no effort**.

Yet, if one **pursues honor and nourishment**, he may **invite death**; if one **seeks to augment life**, he may **bring misfortune**. This is precisely because he **does not understand the principle of yielding to curves** but instead **demands straight paths**.

As for the Sage’s **preservation of his body**, there is indeed a **Dao/Way**. Knowing that **life’s coming cannot be repelled** and its **departure cannot be halted**, he **abandons worldly affairs** to **free himself from burdens**, thus attaining **equilibrium and balance**. The **Dao/Way of equilibrium and balance** is **without partiality or favor**, **without striving or envy**, and thus **Zhuangzi’s theory of life is illuminated**.

If **lowering oneself does not harm life** and **elevating oneself does not benefit life**, then what was said earlier—*"its coming cannot be repelled"*—does it not apply to me? **Having abandoned it, where else can it go?** Thus, his ability to **transcend this body** is precisely his means to **attain preservation**.

Laozi deeply understood the **mysteries of the Dao/Way**, and all his words were **expressions of the formless**. His teachings are **not easily grasped in a single glance**, yet he **never spoke in plain terms**. He often **veiled his truth within words** while **concealing his intent beyond them**, akin to later ages’ **hidden doctrines**.

This was **not to startle the world**. If one **raises a corner** yet **does not reflect the whole**, then even if he **instructs earnestly**, it **brings no benefit**. The rest follows similarly.

Is it not because he lacks selfishness? Thus he can fulfill his own selfishness.»

「Thus, he could fulfill his own selfishness. The principles of the world are such that **unity** with the multitude makes them **public**, while **partiality** toward oneself makes them **private**—yet it is not necessary to **encroach upon others** for self-gain that defines selfishness. When he **positions himself** after others, yet **his actions** precede them as if without intent, his **virtue/power** naturally preserves itself. If he **acts from behind** yet others **follow him first**, as though without design, yet his **virtue/power** remains intact, then it is not by his lack of selfishness that he **fulfills his own selfishness**.

Zhān Qiū Pǔ said: "Heaven and Earth endure long, **thus** they can fulfill their own selfishness." The *Tāo Guāng Zhāng* speaks of **concealing brilliance** to nurture clarity, thereby prolonging its radiance. Thus, Heaven and Earth endure long because they **do not selfishly assert their own virtue/power**, and in the grand **virtue/power** of **generation**, they can achieve **longevity**.

Therefore, the Sage **embodies the law** of Heaven and Earth: he **acts from behind** yet his **virtue/power** stands first, **externalizes himself** yet his **virtue/power** remains firmly preserved. Is this not because his lack of selfishness allows him to **fulfill his own selfishness**? It is all through **concealing brilliance** and not **boasting of his light** that this is so.

Zhāng Chōng replied: "Heaven and Earth endure long because they **do not selfishly assert their own virtue/power**." Heaven’s clarity **endures and covers** all things, long-lasting and unshaken; Earth’s depth **bears and sustains**, enduring and unyielding. Why is this? Because Heaven **endures without selfishly generating its own presence**, it **forgets its own celestial form** yet **covers all things**, the Dao **silently operating** without excess, and Heaven **naturally** endures. Earth **endures without selfishly generating its own substance**, it **forgets its own earthly shape** yet **sustains all things**, the Dao **silently operating** without ceasing, and Earth **naturally** endures. What is meant by **not selfishly generating** is that the Dao **generates itself within me**, silently operating without end, yet **I do not seek its source in my own generation**, so Heaven **forms without form** and Earth **substances without shape**—thus their enduring nature.

The Sage is the one who **perfects the Dao** in the world. Knowing how Heaven and Earth endure, he **aligns his body with the Dao**, not making the Dao his own body. He **honors others** yet does not **honor himself**, so others honor him while he himself remains honored. He **bestows generosity** upon others yet does not **hoard it for himself**, so others grow rich while he himself remains rich. By **humbling and diminishing himself**, he **precedes others** while **preserving his own virtue/power**—this is the **function of concealing brilliance and not selfishly generating**.

If he **conceals yet acts**, as though from **no selfishness**, but **reflects upon it** and finds **fulfillment for himself**, then what is said of him is indeed **selfishness for himself**. Those who **study the Dao** must **reverse-track its concealed brilliance**.

Bái Yù Chán said: "Heaven and Earth endure long. **Silently without action**." Heaven and Earth endure long because **they are thus**. The heart is also so. Because **it does not selfishly generate**, the heart **endures long**. Thus, one can achieve **longevity**. It is **originally without birth or death**. Therefore, the Sage: **I am the same**. I **act from behind** yet my **virtue/power** stands first, **present without absence**. I **externalize myself** yet my **virtue/power** remains preserved—**such is the way of all time**. Is it not because of his **lack of selfishness**? Heaven and Earth share the same **root** with me; all things share the same **body** with me. Thus, he can fulfill his own selfishness. **I am Heaven and Earth**; Heaven and Earth are **I**. Liào Cuìrán said: "Heaven and Earth endure long because **spirit is born from form**, and form can **perfect spirit**. When form and spirit **harmonize**, they **prolong endlessly**. Heaven and Earth endure long because **form and spirit are both immortal**. It is because **they do not selfishly generate**. Form cannot be without spirit to **generate**, spirit cannot be without form to **perfect**. Thus, one can achieve **longevity**. Thus, they **mutually generate** and **mutually perfect**. From ancient times to today, their **name** does not fade.

Therefore, the Sage: **master of affairs and people**, I am the same. I **act from behind** yet my **virtue/power** stands first—**humble yet exalted, radiant**. I **externalize myself** yet my **virtue/power** remains preserved—**retreat and hide in secrecy**, like a hen brooding her eggs. Is it not because of his **lack of selfishness**? **Originally without attachment**, yet **all emotions are obtained**. Thus, he can fulfill his own selfishness. When **public affairs are managed**, then **private affairs are also managed**. Form and spirit **both achieve perfection**, and **harmonize with the Dao**. Chén Bìxū said: "Heaven and Earth endure long—**this is the standard**. Heaven, with its **vast qi**, covers all things, **unshaken from ancient to modern times**, hence called **enduring**. Earth, with its **substantial form**, bears all things, **permanently fixed from beginning to end**, hence called **unyielding**. The **analogy** is used to **establish meaning**, found in the following text.

Why Heaven and Earth endure long—**this is the question**. Because **they do not selfishly generate**, **this is the explanation**. Thus, they can achieve **longevity**—**this concludes the meaning**. Heaven endures in **clarity**, Earth endures in **tranquility**, because they **cover and bear all things**, **nurture and educate all beings**, yet all **draw their nature from the wondrous source**, returning to their **original emptiness**, restoring their **mysterious depths**, and **not boasting of their own generative function**, while **preserving their constant virtue/power**, thus they endure.

Another interpretation says: Heaven and Earth, along with all things, **stand alone yet transform naturally**. All **receive their nature without seeking** to **exceedingly benefit their own generation**, thus they endure. **This is a warning to be heeded**.

Therefore, the Sage **arrives yet his virtue/power remains preserved**. The Sage **does nothing**, yet **his body is in the hall of state** while his **heart wanders in Gūshè**. He **embodies Heaven and Earth’s covering and bearing**, **nourishing all without selfishness**, greatly **acting in humility** yet **not daring to lead the world first**. His people **rejoice and support him** without **burdening him**, **delight in promoting him** without **wearying him**, hence his **virtue/power stands first**. Again, he **forgets his deeds and his name**, **externalizes his body and few desires**, and the world **loves him as a parent**, the **spirits and luminous ones** **assist him like a cherished child**, hence his **virtue/power remains preserved**. Is it not because of his **lack of selfishness**? Thus, he can fulfill his own selfishness. Heaven and Earth **generate and nurture all things**, yet the Sage **externalizes himself to perfect the people**. All **do not use their benevolence to selfishly expand**, how could there be a **selfish heart**? It is truly **without selfishness**. Without selfishness, he can **endure long and remain steadfast**; because of his **longevity and endurance**, he knows how to **fulfill his own selfishness**.

Lǐ Yuē said: "He who **does not selfishly assert himself** yet **selfishly benefits others**—when others’ selfishness is fulfilled, his own selfishness is already fulfilled."

*The **Honglie Exegesis** states:*

When **Gongyi Xiu** served as minister of **Lu** and craved fish, the entire state presented him with fish. **Gongyi Xiu** refused to accept them. His disciple remonstrated: *"Master, you love fish—why refuse them?"* He replied: *"Precisely because I love fish, I refuse them. If I accept the fish and lose my ministerial post, even if I love fish, I cannot sustain myself with them. If I refuse the fish and do not lose my post, then I can forever sustain my love of fish."* This demonstrates his understanding of **serving others while benefiting oneself**. Hence it is said: *"Is it not because of his lack of selfishness? Thus, he can fulfill his own selfishness."*

**Xie Tunan** said: *"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they attain longevity. Heaven’s height and Earth’s depth—born from the **Great Ultimate**, reaching the **Boundless**—truly endure long and steadfast. This is so because Heaven and Earth take **nurturing all things** as their heart; they never seek to sustain themselves, hence their eternal life. Therefore, when the Sage arrives, his body is preserved. The Sage follows Heaven and Earth, taking **nurturing the myriad people** as his heart. He places his own body last, not acting for himself, yet his body is always foremost. He externalizes his body, not possessing it himself, yet his body is always preserved. This is why he can stand alongside Heaven and Earth. Is it not because of his lack of selfishness? Thus, he can fulfill his own selfishness. Heaven and Earth do not sustain themselves—this is lack of selfishness. Yet the sun, moon, stars, and constellations depend upon them; the **Hua Mountains**, rivers, and seas bear them—is this not fulfilling their own selfishness? The Sage does not act for himself—this is lack of selfishness—yet the state and the world are at peace, ancestral temples and altars are honored—is this not fulfilling his own selfishness? The utmost fairness is an unalterable principle; this is the **Dao of enduring longevity**. Heaven, Earth, and the Sage all adhere to this. Indeed, examining the principles of the world, only fairness prevails. Heaven covers without selfishness, Earth bears without selfishness; the **Sage** governs with fairness to labor for the people. The **Classics** say: *'Fairness is kingship; kingship is Heaven; Heaven is the **Dao**; the **Dao** endures.'* Thus, Heaven, Earth, and the Sage all stand together in the world through this utmost fairness, hence their enduring longevity without exhaustion.

Later ages, however, impoverished the lower to enrich the upper, starving the people to fatten themselves. **Qin Shihuang** flogged the world to unify the realm, and **Emperor Yang of Sui** swallowed bandits to monopolize the Central Plains—truly, they achieved their ambitions. Yet their dynasties collapsed within two generations, their ancestral temples ruined, their altars in ruins. Thus, the gains and losses of fairness and selfishness are evident.

**Lin Yongqi** said: *"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness."* This chapter uses Heaven and Earth to illustrate the Sage’s **heart of no contrivance**. Heaven and Earth generate all things naturally, without contrivance, hence their ten thousand years pass like a single day. The Sage cultivates himself without contriving in precedence or sequence, without contriving in inner or outer—thus, though none precede him, he always endures. Hence, though he is without selfishness, he fulfills his own selfishness. This *"selfishness"* refers to his body’s preservation, not the selfishness of public and private. If *"selfishness"* were taken as public-private selfishness, then it could not be called **heart of no contrivance**. These words are **Laozi’s** way of guiding people toward goodness. When the **Buddhist school** reinterpreted them, such language vanished, hence they speak of **true emptiness, real existence**. True emptiness is the meaning of **lack of selfishness**; real existence is the meaning of **fulfilling his own selfishness**. Yet their phrasing, though lofty, is a layer removed.

**Fan Yingyuan** said: *"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they attain longevity."* Among formed things, none endure like Heaven and Earth. Both arise from the **Dao**, hence their enduring longevity stems from their **resting in lack of selfishness**, not seeking to benefit themselves, thus they attain eternal life. **Riverbank Master** said: *"This speaks of Heaven and Earth’s eternal life to instruct people."* Therefore, when the Sage arrives, his body is preserved. The Sage is humble and does not contend for precedence, yet people naturally revere him. The Sage does not contend, does not oppose things, yet nothing can harm him. Is it not because of his lack of selfishness? Thus, he fulfills his own selfishness. The Sage fulfills his own selfishness—not in crookedness, not in wickedness—but because common people seek to benefit themselves, hence they cannot attain precedence and preservation, while the Sage’s humility and non-contention alone enable him to attain precedence and preservation.

**Xue Yongqi** said: *"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness."* Once form and number are complete, formation and decay are inevitable. Are Heaven and Earth truly enduring? Their enduring longevity comes from **generating without self-generation**, hence their eternal life. Humble yet radiant, low yet uncrossable—placing his body last, yet his body is foremost. Not burdened by death, life, wealth, or nobility, his spirit is whole; externalizing his body, yet his body is preserved. **Emperor Yao** ceded the realm to **Xuyou**, **Emperor Shun** to **Shan Jun**, because of their lack of selfishness, thus they fulfilled their own selfishness.

**Restful Retreat Hermit** said: *"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness."* All formed things escape not the four **kalpas** of arising, dwelling, decay, and emptiness. Only Heaven and Earth endure because they do not self-generate. **Qi** emanates to manifest the **Two Principles**, true **qi** circulating without beginning or end, hence their eternal life. The Sage is the **Three Powers’** manifestation after Heaven and Earth, the world thus formed. **Body foremost**—his luminous true nature precedes the **Great Ultimate** yet is already present. **Externalizing his body, yet his body preserved**—if one establishes the world without clinging, this is called **body beyond things**; though the world decays, true nature does not decay.

「Is it not because of their lack of selfishness? True nature differs from things, thus it can well fulfill its own selfishness.»

**Chu Bo-xiu** said: *"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness."* Indeed, since the **cosmic chaos** (*hun-dun*) first divided, the light and clear ascend and float upward, while the heavy and turbid descend and sink downward. The **principle of existence and nonexistence** (*you-wu*) and the **vessel of Dao** (*dao-qi*) rely on each other to stand, spanning the ages without ceasing their transformative and generative processes—thus they endure. Why is this so? It is because they do not self-generate. To self-generate is to cling to self and fail to give birth to things; how could they then endure eternally?

The Sage manifests **body foremost** (*shen-xian*) and **body beyond things** (*wu-wai-shen*), merely abandoning selfishness for the sake of the public, emulating Heaven and following Earth’s ways to nourish the people and cultivate all things. All who practice humility, dwell in lowliness, do not presume to be first, decline merit and yield to ability, and retreat to preserve their whole—these are acts of **body foremost**. Yet when the world joyfully acclaims them, they cannot but assume the lead.

To dwell in humble thatched huts, eat coarse grasses, guard true nature while cherishing self, awaken from the dream of life and death—these are acts of **body beyond things**, yet they surpass the pursuit of noble life, and thus their preservation is inevitable.

The **gentleman** (*jun-zi*) does good, fulfilling what is rightfully his due. Does he seek reward for it? Heaven’s aid to the virtuous is without a shred of private intent; it follows by kindred nature, like an echo answering a call. The Sage embodies Heaven’s impartiality, follows the Dao’s generative virtue, fearing only that one thing might lose its place—thus Heaven’s response and divine blessings are complete. Though human affairs may seem to fulfill selfishness, in truth they arise from Heaven’s utmost impartiality; thus his blessings and rejoicings are without shame.

When the **gentleman** receives blessings, is it not for his own honor? No—it is to extend virtue to the people, broadening Heaven and Earth’s **great virtue** (*da-de*). If one does good while harboring even a trace of selfish gain, then it is not true goodness; its end may even lead to evil. Can one not be cautious at its beginning?

**Niu Miao-zhuan** said: *"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness."* Heaven is the accumulation of **yang** (*yang*), thus it can fulfill its function and cover all; it spans the ages without wearing down, hence it is called ‘long.’ Earth is the accumulation of **yin** (*yin*), thus it can fulfill its function and bear all; it endures through the **kalpas** without decay, hence it is called ‘durable.’ Yet why do they endure both long and durable? It is because Heaven and Earth do not presume to be able to endure; thus they endure. They do not presume to be able to fulfill their own selfishness; thus they fulfill it.

**Lie Zi** said: *"There is life that does not generate, and there is non-generation that can generate life. The generating cannot help but generate, thus it is always generating. Always generating is without a time that does not generate, but non-generation is singular. Singular non-generation—its Dao is unfathomable."* Is this not so?

Thus the Sage manifests **body foremost** and **body beyond things**. The Sage is the **humble gentleman** (*qian-qian jun-zi*). Why is this so? Did not Confucius say, *"The Sage—whom I cannot see, but if I see a gentleman, that is enough"*? Those who do not dare to be first, but instead place themselves after others—are they not the **humble gentlemen**?

**Lao Zi** said: *"He who does not dare to be first under Heaven can thus fulfill his function and endure."* Confucius also said: *"First act according to your words, then follow them."* In ancient times, **Hu Qiu Zi Lin** told **Lie Zi**: *"If you know how to hold back, then you can know how to hold yourself."* **Lie Zi** said: *"I wish to hear of holding back."* He replied: *"Look at your shadow, and you will know."* The ancients referred to "you" as "shadow."

**Lie Zi** looked back and observed his shadow: when his form bent, the shadow curved; when his form straightened, the shadow stood upright. Thus, bending and straightening follow his form, not his shadow; yielding and extending follow things, not himself. This is called **holding back while assuming the lead**.

Is this not the saying? **Body beyond things** preserves itself.

The **body** is but the **manifestation** (*wei-xing*) of Heaven and Earth’s entrusted form, thus Dao encompasses the **Four Great Elements** (*si-da*), and **virtue** fulfills the **Five Constants** (*wu-chang*), making it the most **spirited** of all things. Those who value their **body** place merit and fame beyond consideration, store Heaven’s principle within their chests—thus they can preserve their **body**, safeguard their life, and complete their years.

If one flaunts their talents and covets fame, then they cannot escape the afflictions of the **body**. The ancients said: *"Straight wood is felled first; sweet wells run dry first. The elephant loses its life for its tusks; the fragrant pine is burned for its scent."* **Zhuang Zi** said: *"When achievements are complete, the vessel is broken; when fame is attained, the virtue is lost."* Who can abandon fame and achievement, returning to share with the common people?

**Lao Zi** said: *"He who externalizes Heaven and Earth has Heaven and Earth; he who externalizes his body has longevity."* This is the saying.

In the present age, many **gentlemen** endanger their **body** and abandon their life—is this not tragic? Is it not because of their lack of selfishness that they fulfill their own selfishness?

This is truly speaking of the Sage’s **body foremost** and **body beyond things**, not of one who acts without mind. When the Sage assumes **body foremost** and **body beyond things** to fulfill the policies of the Sage, it is indeed due to the operation of selfishness—thus it is called *fulfill their own selfishness*.

The **lack of selfishness** is to say **non-action** (*wu-wei*). *Fulfilling their own selfishness* is **action** (*you-wei*). Moreover, there is no affair under Heaven that can be accomplished without action or achieved without effort. **Non-action** is the Sage’s **true nature** (*ti*); **action** is the Sage’s **application** (*yong*). When **true nature** and **application** are both complete, only then does the Sage’s Dao manifest—how could one cling to **non-action** and hinder *fulfilling their own selfishness*?

If a person lacks selfishness, then how do they differ from **clay and wooden figures** (*tu-mu ou-ren*)? **Lao Zi** said: *"If one speaks of ‘no mind,’ then Dao itself has no mind. It is still one layer of mountain apart."* This is truly speaking of knowing **true nature** but not **application**.

**Yang Zhi-ren** said: *"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness."* Heaven’s **emptiness** (*xu*) reaches its utmost, thus it endures; Earth’s **thick bearing** (*hou-zai*) is vast, thus it is durable. Because they do not self-generate, they rely on the **rotation of the sun and moon** (*ri-yue xuan-zhuan*) to generate, thus they can fulfill their own selfishness. If Heaven did not rotate, the sun and moon would not shine; if Earth were to dry up, all things would not generate.

The **human body**—its **inherent nature** (*ben-xing*) is called Heaven; its **original mandate** (*yuan-ming*) is called Earth.

If **life and nature** are both preserved and cultivated according to the Dao, one may endure as long as Heaven and Earth.

Thus, the virtuous person practices humility, retreat, and self-effacement, placing themselves last, yet others revere them and they lead by example. Those who can cultivate the **outer body** beyond the body, who know the **spirit within the spirit**, the **true nature within nature**, and the **Dao within the Dao**, are those who can transcend the body and attain eternal preservation.

Is it not because the Sage achieves this through their **public virtue and selflessness**? Hence, by being selfless yet abundant, they fulfill their own **selfishness**.

*The Doctrine of the Mean* states:
*"The utmost sincerity knows no exhaustion. Without exhaustion, it endures; enduring, it manifests; manifesting, the heart becomes vast and enduring. Vast and enduring, it becomes lofty and bright. Vast and enduring—this is what bears all things. Lofty and bright—this is what covers all things. Vast and enduring—this is what completes all things. Vast and enduring correspond to Earth; lofty and bright correspond to Heaven; vast and enduring are boundless. Thus, it shines without being seen, transforms without moving, and achieves without action. The Dao of Heaven and Earth can be fully expressed in a single word."*

Yù Qīngzhōng said: *"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness."* Heaven, with its **primordial qi** (*yīyuán zhī qì*), circulates across the **four directions** without interruption or cessation, hence its endurance. Earth, in its **submissive form**, bears all things and remains constant, lacking nothing and leaning on nothing, hence its durability. Yet what enables their eternal endurance?

It is because they generate all things without claiming credit. All things cannot generate themselves; they must rely on Heaven and Earth for their existence. Heaven and Earth do not take credit for generating all things but grow alongside them. Thus, the generator of all things is Heaven and Earth, and their **eternal generation** is what allows all things to thrive. **Eternal life** is spoken of when generation is mentioned, for endurance is inherent within it.

The heart of Heaven and Earth is a heart of **universal impartiality**. The Sage embodies this universal impartiality of Heaven and Earth, placing themselves after Heaven and Earth yet leading in heart. They place themselves last, yet others revere them first.

Not possessing what they have, they preserve it. They transcend the body, yet the body endures. Is this not because selflessness enables such attainment? Selflessness is universality—only the selfless can truly fulfill their own selfishness. Those who embody the **Heavenly Mandate** naturally return to it, without expectation or contrivance. Though it seems selfish, it is truly universal.

Xū Liùxū said: *"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they attain eternal life."* Heaven’s endurance and Earth’s durability—this is the central theme of this passage. What follows is its elucidation. Yet by reasoning that they do not generate themselves, one concludes that Heaven and Earth endure and last because they do not contrive their own existence. If Heaven and Earth had a self-serving intent to prolong their lives, how could they truly endure?

Thus, when the Sage arrives, the body is preserved. The Sage places themselves last, yet others revere them first, following the Dao of Heaven and Earth in not generating themselves. They hold fast to humility and retreat, so the world naturally honors them as first. Those who transcend the body know that the body is not truly theirs; through **non-action, tranquility, and emptiness**, nothing can harm them. The body is naturally transcended—not by deliberate effort, but by natural detachment. Thus, the body is preserved.

Is this not because of their selflessness? Hence, they fulfill their own selfishness.

The Sages attain **leading by example and eternal preservation** because they follow the Dao of Heaven and Earth in not generating themselves, not by selfish intent. Thus, they achieve the fulfillment of **leading by example and eternal preservation**.

Chái Yuángāo said: *"Heaven and Earth endure eternally—unchangeably."* Heaven and Earth endure because they fulfill their roles of covering and bearing all things, shaping forms naturally without contrivance. Thus, when the Sage arrives, the body is preserved. They diminish themselves to enrich others; others naturally honor them. They abandon self for the benefit of all, yet do not take from others. They do not act selfishly, yet fulfill their own selfishness. They forget their own selfish desires and fulfill the expectations of others. This is how the Sage aligns with the enduring Dao of Heaven and Earth.

Sū Jìngjìng said: *"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness."* Since ancient times, none have matched Heaven and Earth in endurance. Yet who truly understands why Heaven and Earth endure? The **Supreme Ultimate Dao** truly generates them, yet Heaven and Earth do not generate themselves. If they were to grow alongside all things, they would merely be one thing among many—how could they then attain eternal life?

Heaven and Earth stand above all things, yet do not compete with them, thus they endure eternally. The Sage understands this, always placing the world before themselves and their body last. When the people are hungry, they dare not indulge in satiety while others starve; when the people are cold, they dare not wear heavy garments while others shiver. They treat the people with the intimacy of father and son, yet do not dare to neglect them as distant relatives; they treat them as brothers, yet do not dare to exclude them.

Though the Sage places themselves last, the world reveres them first. Though they transcend the body, the world preserves them. Just as Heaven and Earth, by not generating themselves, endure eternally in their generation, so too does the Sage, by placing themselves last and transcending the body, not dare to act selfishly for their own sake. Yet the people wish to honor the Sage’s body, to preserve the Sage’s life. The Sage wishes to retreat, yet the people honor them first; the Sage wishes to transcend, yet the people preserve them. Is this not fulfilling their own selfishness?

Thus, it is known that those who are not self-serving are truly able to fulfill their selfishness.

Běn Yī’ān Chúshì said: *"Heaven and Earth endure eternally, thus they fulfill their own selfishness."* To complete all things is to complete oneself. Common people see the self and others as distinct, thus they eagerly seek to fulfill their selfishness. Yet those who are selfish ultimately gain no benefit, while those who are selfless paradoxically achieve self-fulfillment. This is the natural order.

Now, consider how Heaven and Earth treat all things: they scatter with wind and nourish with rain, stir with thunder and illuminate with sun and moon. All is done solely for the sake of generating all things.

The movement and circulation of all things never cease—
this is how they endure eternally.

The Sage’s governance diminishes the high to benefit the low,
sets aside the self to follow others.
Yet when the people are amply provided for, who is there to suffer want?
There has never been one who, being kind, abandoned their kin,
or who, upholding righteousness, delayed serving their lord—
what greater benefit could there be?

If people understand this, they may broaden their vision beyond the self
and expand their heart toward the great public good.

Stone Pool [said]: *"Heaven and Earth endure eternally.*
The reason Heaven and Earth can endure so long is that they do not generate themselves—
thus they attain eternal life.
Therefore, the Sage places himself last, yet his worth is foremost;
sets himself aside, yet his essence remains.
Is this not because of their lack of selfishness?
Thus they fulfill their own selfishness."

Yet interpretations of this passage differ.
The ancients held that Heaven and Earth’s eternal life was like a person’s longevity—
their enduring existence.
Modern commentators argue that *generating* refers to generating all things,
meaning Heaven and Earth merely generate others without generating themselves—
what is called ‘not generating yet generating generation.’

However, examining the latter passage, both interpretations have merit.
When it speaks of ‘placing himself last’ and ‘setting himself aside,’
this is the generation of all things.
When it speaks of ‘his worth being foremost’ and ‘his essence remaining,’
this is the generation of longevity.
If we speak of their lack of selfishness, it is the generation of all things.
If we speak of fulfilling their selfishness, it is the generation of longevity.

To unify these, the ‘not generating themselves’ refers to generating all things,
while ‘eternal life’ pertains to longevity.
Though Heaven and Earth cannot be spoken of in terms of life and death,
their enduring existence is eternal life itself.

Evaluating thus, Laozi’s intent is precisely that Heaven and Earth,
by generating all things without selfishness, attain eternal endurance.
If people can abandon selfishness to seek life,
they too may endure eternally.

Yet Laozi’s teaching truly seeks eternal life—
why then does he speak thus?
Fundamentally, this passage connects with the later chapter on *Entering and Exiting Life and Death*.
For people’s pursuit of life often harms it—
like trampling seedlings to hasten growth—
leading to self-destruction, as if driving them to their death.
Only by nurturing gently, without excessive effort,
as indicated in the *Spirit of the Upper Valley* chapter,
can one attain eternal life without striving for it.

**Chapter on the Supreme Virtue of Water** (考异: *He Shang Gong*’s *Chapter on Changing Nature*, Zhao Shixian’s *Chapter on Gentle Compliance and Rectifying Justice*)

**Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Commentary:**
The preceding chapter illuminated the Way’s boundless virtue—Heaven and Earth are without selfishness, thus enduring forever.
This chapter clarifies that the Sage, like water in its gentle flow, incurs no blame.
It begins with the metaphor of water, showing how its three virtues approach the Dao.
Next, it states that water dwells in the lowly, embodying the seven supreme qualities in benefiting all.
It concludes with *not contending*, urging adherence to gentleness to preserve ultimate victory.

Du Guangting says:
Water’s virtue is gentle and yielding, serene and harmonious,
dwelling in compliance, flowing downward—
swelling or dispersing with the seasons, adapting to vessels’ shapes,
becoming springs or scattering as mist and dew.
All things lose it and die; gain it and live.
Strike it and it is unharmed; grasp it and it slips away.
Yet it does not fully reach the Dao,
for water has form while the Dao is formless.
Though form may hinder, in its virtue of benefiting all
and its humble use, water nears the Dao.

The *Dao De Jing* uses water as an analogy
to exhort those cultivating the Dao,
urging them to embody the seven virtues and three abilities,
to refine their person and govern the realm,
while preserving the virtue of *not contending*—
thus avoiding blame or fault.

Zhang Chongying responds:
This *nature* refers to the character one cultivates after growth.
Humans inherit the *qi* of Heaven and Earth,
and originally have no vice—
but as they grow, emotions disrupt them,
stirring the five desires,
and their nature becomes mostly unvirtuous.
Thus, people abandon the Dao and ruin themselves,
yet fail to repent.
This chapter admonishes those who let their cultivated nature run wild,
urging them to restrain it
and thereby advance toward the Dao.
For its virtue is like water’s:
Water benefits all things without contending,
dwelling where others abhor.
Thus it nearly attains the Dao.

It dwells in the lowly—
Water’s nature is pure,
flowing over earth’s grass and trees,
then descending—
akin to the receptive yielding of the female.
Its heart is deep—
Water is profound and empty,
its depths clear and luminous.
Its giving is benevolent—
All things receive water and flourish;
it fills the void, never the full.
Its speech is trustworthy—
Water’s inner reflection reveals truth,
its form never betraying its essence.
Its governance is harmonious—
It cleanses all without exception.
Its deeds are accomplished—
It adapts to square or round,
bending or straightening as needed.
Its movement is timely—
It disperses in summer, congeals in winter,
acting in accordance with the seasons.
Only because it does not contend,
it incurs no blame.
Thus, the world finds no fault with water.

Wang Fusi says:
The Sage’s virtue, like water, nears the Dao—
Humans abhor the lowly,
yet water, dwelling there, nearly attains the Dao.
The Dao lacks what water has,
thus it is called *nearly*.

Water’s dwelling in the lowly extends to its virtue of *no blame*—
This shows that water conforms to this Dao.

Emperor Xuanzong says:
The Sage’s virtue, like water—
This illustrates the Sage’s supreme virtue.
Thus, water’s nature is used as the analogy nearing the Dao.
**Commentary:**
*Supreme virtue* refers to the Sage’s conduct.
*Like water* is metaphor.
The Sage’s actions embody water’s virtues,
all detailed below, each containing a deeper meaning.

Water’s virtue benefits all, even where others abhor—
**Commentary:**
Water is sweet and deep,
spreading everywhere,
nourishing what it touches—
those who receive its blessings grow,
thus it is called *beneficial*.
This is its first ability.

No thing is softer than water,
yet it can be modeled—
clear, it reflects truth;
flowing, it fills valleys,
carrying all in its current—
it brings harmony where others seek it,
yet never contends.
This is its second ability.

Others shun the lowly and impure,
yet water accepts it,
dwelling in filth without complaint.
This is its third ability.
Thus it nearly attains the Dao.

*Near* means *close*.
**Commentary:**
Its benefiting all is manifest,
its not contending shows gentleness,
its dwelling in filth demonstrates tolerance—
these are water’s three abilities.
Only the Sage consistently embodies them,
thus his conduct nears the Dao without straying far.
Hence, it is said *close*.

It dwells in the lowly—
The Sage’s person is gentle and yielding,
like water’s flowing downward,
nourishing all.
Earth’s nature is lowly,
yet water favors descending there.
**Commentary:**
The Sage’s dwelling is beneficial,
like water’s flowing on earth—
the more it benefits, the greater its virtue.
Earth’s virtue lies in its lowliness,
and water descends naturally.
This mirrors the Sage’s humility,
nearing the Dao’s gentle nature,
thus it is said *dwelling in the lowly*.

Its heart is deep—
The Sage’s mind is profound and still,
like water’s resting in springs.
**Commentary:**
The Sage’s mind excels in tranquility,
like water’s nature—
calm, it becomes clear;
at ease, it attains insight.
*Springs* symbolize deep stillness.
Thus it is said *heart is deep*.

Its giving is benevolent—
His generosity aligns with supreme benevolence,
like water’s nourishing all things.

**Commentary:**
The Supreme Benevolence of boundless aid
always gives to others,
and its generous deeds align with virtuous conduct,
like water nourishing all—
without favor or aversion.
Thus it is said: *giving is transformative*.

**On truthful speech:**
Words must be sincere and true,
like water flowing through perilous paths—
never failing in its constancy.
**Commentary:**
The Superior Person’s speech is ever true,
guiding the common folk,
truthful without deceit,
like springs that flow—
how could they differ in their steadfastness?
Thus it is said: *speech is truthful*.

**On skillful governance:**
To govern well is to regulate,
like water cleansing all things,
making them pure and cool.
**Commentary:**
Governance means rectification.
The Superior Person, in all actions,
acts without contrivance,
rectifies appearance to enlighten beings—
beings follow what is rectified,
and rectification brings order.
What could be better than this?
Like water’s nature, cleansing all things,
making them pure.
Thus it is said: *governance is skillful*.

**On capable action:**
In all undertakings, one adapts with ease,
like water’s nature—
square in a square vessel, round in a round one,
never hindered by form.
**Commentary:**
The Superior Person is all-encompassing,
unobstructed by things.
Whatever moves or acts,
all matters are traversed—
traversed, thus capable.
This is clarity and insight.
Like water’s nature—
when it flows as rivers,
when dammed, it becomes earth;
floating boats, embracing emptiness—
what it cannot do?
This is capability.
Thus it is said: *action is capable*.

**On timely response:**
Things move and one responds,
never missing the moment.
Like water’s thawing in spring and freezing in winter.
**Commentary:**
The Superior Person’s heart
is like an empty valley,
a mirror’s reflection—
when things stir, it responds.
Like water’s nature—
thawing in spring, freezing in winter,
rising and falling with the seasons.
Thus it is said: *response is timely*.

**On non-contention:**
Only the non-contending
has no blame.
The Superior Person, with a vacant heart,
follows things naturally,
like water—
when dammed, it flows elsewhere.
It never opposes things,
thus there is no blame.
**Commentary:**
Blame means fault.
The Superior Person’s conduct
harms no being,
vacant-hearted and complete,
never competing—
waves ebb and flow,
yielding thus,
never opposing things,
so there is no blame.
Du Guangting says:
*The Superior is like water.*
The Superior cultivates the Dao and refines the heart,
adapting to changes with the times,
moving freely to benefit beings.
The Master Lao wished to reveal the Superior’s virtue
to encourage later learners,
comparing water to the Dao,
thus using water as an analogy.
The Superior’s goodness
forgets its own goodness,
like water not boasting of its deeds—
water’s deeds are greater when unboasted,
virtue shines brighter when unvaunted.
Great and bright,
this is the highest goodness.

From the sovereign on high
to the recluse in the rocks,
if one is like water,
then the Dao is attained.
The analogy uses water as metaphor,
the Dao as principle,
and the Superior Person as its practitioner.

Water excels in benefiting what others despise.
Sweetness is water’s flavor.
Depth is water’s essence.
Water is the mother of *qi*,
ruling the North,
its virtue is to nourish below.
Its color is black,
its nature is wisdom,
its taste is salty,
its number is six.
The North is the beginning of Yang virtue,
the end of Yin *qi*.
Its generative number is one,
matching the Dao.
The Dao is also one—
the one without a one,
water is also one—
the one with a one.
The one without a one is the Dao’s essence,
the one with a one is the Dao’s function.
Thus, water is the Dao’s function.
All things rely on its nourishment to flourish,
and because it nourishes,
it gives rise to all things,
thus it ranks first among the three capabilities.

Gentleness is water’s virtue.
*The Dao De Jing*, Chapter 41, says:
*Nothing in the world is softer than water,*
*yet it overcomes the hardest things.*
Again, water’s virtue is emphasized to encourage embracing gentleness.

Water, when level, does not flow;
law follows equanimity as its foundation,
thus it can be emulated.
Water’s stillness reflects things.
Hence it is said:
*No one mirrors themselves in flowing water,*
*but in still water.*
Because it is clear and tranquil.
Water’s nature is level—
when encountering unevenness, it passes;
when meeting marshes, it stops.
East, west, south, north—
it follows where it is led,
never contending with others,
nothing it cannot traverse.
Comparing all virtues,
it is said its generative function is unmatched,
thus it ranks second among the three capabilities.

Human nature follows convention for the many,
but few are humble and yielding.
Most love high positions,
fearing lowly ones.
Only water
dwells low without contention,
resides in filth without shame.
Compared to the previous virtues,
this one surpasses them,
thus it ranks third among the three capabilities.
Thus it nears the Dao.

If the ruler embodies the virtue of boundless aid,
holds a humble and yielding heart,
and practices containing impurity,
then the world will be at peace.
For those cultivating the self,
their efforts extend to all things—
gentleness governs nature,
dwelling in filth to follow the common,
abandoning traces while humbly shining,
then immortality may be hoped for.

**On dwelling in the lowly:**
This clarifies delighting in humility
as the way to preserve the state and body.
The sky’s purity and lightness
make it use its height,
the earth’s turbidity and thickness
make it rest in lowliness.
*The Book of Changes* says:
*The sky is exalted, the earth is lowly,*
*low and high are arranged.*
Again:
*The earth’s way is low yet ascends.*
Water follows lowliness and dwells beneath,
mirroring the Superior’s humble virtue.

**On a profound heart:**
This clarifies clarity, tranquility, and emptiness
as the method for purifying the self and washing the heart.
*A minister’s heart is like water,*
*a minister’s gate is like a market.*
Is this not so?

**On generous giving:**
This clarifies nourishing all things
as the conduct of universal aid and rescue.
The more one gives to others,
the more one possesses;
the more one gives away,
the more one has.
This is the meaning.

**On truthful speech:**
This clarifies sincerity without deceit
as the eternal and verified teaching.
*Flowing through peril does not lose its truth*—
*The Book of Changes*, the *Kàn* hexagram, says:
*Habitual Kàn—*
*double peril.*

「Water flows yet never overflows,
*it moves through peril without losing its truth.*

**On governing the state and nurturing the people:**
To lead by the Dao/Way, one must first embody it oneself—
speaking only what is true and sincere,
so as to stir the heavens and earth,
and awaken the luminous spirits.
Thus, words of good and evil arise within a single chamber,
yet echo across a thousand leagues—
*this is the utmost truthfulness.*

Confucius said:
*"Remove food and arms, yet let truthfulness remain."*
*How profound his words were!*

**On virtuous governance:**
This clarifies the true and authentic transformation of all things,
as the method to transcend the ordinary and attain the sage’s path.

*One who embodies true virtue and understands all things*—
as in the *Zhuangzi*’s *□Dianzi Fang* chapter:
Dianzi, whose name means "Unselective," attended upon Wei Wenhou.
Wenhou studied with Zixia and befriended Dianzi.
Dianzi often praised the Dao/Way of the *Xigong*,
and Wenhou took the *Xigong* as Dianzi’s teacher.
Dianzi said:
*"No, the *Xigong* is merely a neighbor from my village.
I frequently speak of the Dao/Way correctly,
so the *Xigong* praises me.
My true teacher is Dongguo Shunzi.
He is a man of true virtue—
his outward form reflects humanity,
yet his inner nature aligns with the Dao/Way,
preserving purity and clarity while embracing all things.
Things lack no Dao/Way when he appears,
for his bearing awakens understanding in others,
dissolving all false intentions.
How could I, Unselective, ever compare to him?
This is when things lose their Dao/Way,
and Dongguo Shunzi corrects his bearing,
his heart merging with the Way,
while things behold him and naturally awaken—
false desires utterly vanish.
*This may truly be called*
*the Dao/Way that acts without words,
and transforms without exertion.*
*How profound the true Dao/Way is!*

**On skillful action:**
This clarifies following natural tendencies and adapting to circumstances,
as the method of flexible, responsive, and harmonious conduct.

Water conforms to square or round vessels,
and its flow adjusts to blockages or releases—
thus it can traverse seas and float beneath the heavens,
*expansive and vast.*
A ruler governs by natural order,
delegating tasks to the worthy,
using them without doubt,
each fulfilling their role—
*then governance requires no effort,*
and peace prevails in all things.

**On timely action:**
This clarifies rising and retreating according to the times,
as the precept to uphold the Dao/Way and preserve life.

*Pan*—to disperse—
spring spreads the warmth of yang,
layered ice melts and disperses,
winter brings cold and harshness,
yet flowing waters solidify and freeze—
*water follows the seasons.*

The Way of governing the state,
the method of cultivating oneself,
expands or contracts with the times,
following the nature of things—
*then one attains the utmost principle,*
*then one preserves life.*

**On the virtue of non-contention:**
Only by not contending does one avoid blame.
The virtue of non-contention is the foremost virtue.
Human nature cannot avoid contention,
yet those who contend are many:
*obstinate defiance contends,*
*violence and arrogance contend,*
*anger and rage contend,*
*excess and waste contend,*
*boastfulness and self-aggrandizement contend,*
*love of victory and rivalry contend,*
*disturbance and obstruction contend,*
*greed and ambition contend,*
*courage and cowardice contend,*
*love and hatred contend,*
*selfishness and tyranny contend,*
*favoritism and partiality contend.*

If a king harbors even one of these,
*he will raise armies throughout the land.*
If a feudal lord harbors even one of these,
*their states will clash in war.*

**On the Virtue of Non-Contention in the Common and the Lowly:**

If a high official harbors even one of these [vices],
*he will bring ruin to his household.*
If a commoner harbors even one of these,
*harm will arise within himself.*

All such contention stems from
*lack of thought and reflection,*
*transgressing rites and laws,*
*without fear or reverence,*
*without tolerance or forbearance—*
*thus contention arises.*

Therefore, those who contend over cities
*fill the city with slaughtered men,*
and those who contend over land
*fill the fields with slaughtered men.*
One must examine the roots of contention,
*block its source,*
*and then all will be in harmony.*

The saying goes:
*The virtuous person contends not.*
Again it is said:
*In ugliness, one does not contend.*
The lower scriptures say:
*The Dao of the Sage is to act without contending.*
What fault could there be in the virtue of non-contention?

**The Four Virtues of the Highest Good:**

*The Empty-Hearted*—
*the empty-hearted have no desires.*
*The Flexibly Whole*—
*the flexibly whole bend themselves to preserve others.*
*The Flowing Wave*—
*the flowing wave follows nature’s ease,*
*the decadent and slack—*
*the decadent and slack abandon restraint without hindrance.*

*The Flowing Wave*—
As *Zhuangzi* says in *"The Response of the Emperor"*:
*"Transformation and decay flow like the tides,*
*the affairs of the world surge like waves—*
*nothing remains unchanged."*

*The Yielding-Compliant*—
*the yielding-compliant surrender their heart to the Way.*

**The Three Abilities:**
To embody these four virtues,
to follow these three abilities—
*this is the key to national peace and longevity.*

As *Dao Jun of Song* said:
*The highest good is like water.*

*The Book of Changes* says:
*"The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao,*
*and what follows it is called virtue."*
*Zhuangzi* says:
*"To separate virtue from the Dao."*

Once virtue is named,
*the essence of the Dao is diminished.*
Yet heaven generates water from the One,
*not yet far from the Dao.*
Deep and void, still and clear—
*this is called the utmost refinement in the world.*

Thus, the highest good is like water.
Water is supremely beneficial,
*nearly approaching the Dao.*

It condenses into rain and dew,
*nourishing all things;*
it freezes into frost and snow,
*forming all treasures;*
it flows as rivers and lakes,
*gathering in pools and marshes.*
Deep springs and vast seas
*draw and store,*
*enriching life and growth—*
*all things rely on it without depletion.*
In benefiting others,
*what is more excellent than this?*

Benefiting all things,
*all things receive its grace,*
*its bestowal,*
*yet it remains in the humble, weak, non-contending place.*
It absorbs filth and dirt,
*without burdening itself with self-regard,*
*thus it is close to the Dao.*

*Ji*—near.

**The Six Virtues of Water:**

*Residing in the good place.*
Flowing through the earth,
*it fills without overflowing.*
*The good heart is deep.*
*The deeper it is measured,*
*the deeper it becomes;*
*the further it is explored,*
*the more distant it grows.*
*The good is kind.*
*It loves all without partiality,*
*gives without choosing.*
*The good word is trustworthy.*
*Avoiding obstacles, it reaches the seas;*
*traversing dangers, it never loses its truth.*
*The good governance is orderly.*
*It purifies the impure,*
*levels the steep,*
*follows nature effortlessly,*
*without scheming in its heart—*
*thus all is governed.*
*The good skill is adaptable.*
*It bends to the land’s curves and straightness,*
*to the vessel’s roundness and angles;*
*it adapts to constant change*
*yet remains ever balanced.*
*The good action is timely.*
*When released, it flows east;*
*when directed, it flows west—*
*it moves without constraint,*
*proper only in its season.*

Only by not contending
*does one avoid blame.*

The Sage embodies the Dao,
*thus preserving the body for enduring life,*
*and benefiting others*
*while dwelling in the non-contending place.*

*Zhuangzi* says:
*"Is it easy to have and yet do nothing with it?"*
*It is easy to do nothing and commit few faults,*
*but difficult to act and yet have no regrets.*
*Once one benefits others through action,*
*to remain blameless becomes difficult.*

The highest good benefits others like water’s nature—
*it benefits without choosing what to benefit,*
*it does not contend with others,*
*and thus none can contend with it,*
*hence no blame arises.*

Thus it is said:
*"Under heaven, nothing is as soft and weak as water,*
*yet in attacking the hard and strong,*
*nothing can surpass it."*

*Wang Anshi* said:
*The highest good is like water.*
*What is called "good" can follow the Dao,*
*yet it cannot exhaust the Dao—*
*thus the person of highest good is like water.*

Water’s nature is to benefit all things,
*all things rely on water to live,*
*yet water’s nature is supremely soft and weak—*
*thus it does not contend.*

People prefer the high and despise the low,
*yet water dwells where people despise.*

**Residing in the good place—**
*The good place is low.*
**The good heart is deep—**
*Deep is still.*
**The good is kind—**
*It gives without seeking return.*
**The good word is trustworthy—**
*Even if bent a thousand times, it flows east.*
**The good governance is orderly—**
*The most yielding overcomes the world’s hardness.*
**The good skill is adaptable—**
*If square, it becomes square; if round, it becomes round.*
**The good action is timely—**
*In spring it rises; in winter it freezes.*

As *Su Yingbin* said:
*The highest good is like water,*
*thus nearly approaching the Dao.*

*The Book of Changes* says:
*"The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao,*
*and what follows it is called virtue,*
*what fulfills it is called nature."*
*Again it says:*
*"Heaven generates water from the One."*
*Just as the Dao moves to become virtue,*
*so too does qi move to generate water.*
Thus it is said:
*The highest good is like water.*

Both arise from the formless and take form—
*their principles are the same.*
The Dao is everywhere, benefiting all,
*and so too is water.*

Yet once they have taken form,
*they diverge from the Dao.*
Thus it is said:
*"Nearly approaching the Dao."*

Yet nothing can be named as good
*as this—*
*thus it is called the highest good.*

**From Residing in the Good Place to Acting in Due Time:**

*Avoiding the high, seeking the low,*
*never opposing—*
*this is the good place;*
*Empty, still, silent, unfathomable—*
*this is the good depth;*
*Benefiting all things,*
*giving without seeking return—*
*this is the good kindness;*
*Round, it turns; square, it bends;*
*blocked, it stops; released, it flows—*
*this is the good trustworthiness;*
*Purifying all filth,*
*leveling high and low—*
*this is the good governance;*
*Encountering things, it takes their form,*
*yet does not cling to one—*
*this is the good skill;*
*In winter it freezes, in spring it thaws,*
*in drought it recedes, in flood it swells—*
*this is the good timing.*

Only by not contending
*does one avoid blame.*

Even if one has virtue,
*they are not free from human censure—*
*for they contend.*

**The Virtue of Water: The Supreme Good**

Water alone does not contend,
and thus it encompasses the seven virtues without blame.

**Lǚ Jìfǔ said:**
*The Supreme Good is like water.*

The interplay of yin and yang—this is the Dao.
What follows is virtue.

To call it "following" is already to depart from the Dao,
and thus it is no longer the body of the Dao itself.
The Supreme Good is the Dao’s own virtue.

Not all under heaven know virtue as virtue,
and so it is like water.

Water’s virtue is in its utility—
it nearly attains the Dao.

For water benefits all things without contending,
dwelling where others abhor.

And so the Supreme Good does likewise—
yet this is still not the Dao itself,
but nearly so.

**Residing in the Good Place.**
The rivers and seas rule over all valleys
because they are low.
Thus, to dwell is to be in the Good Place.

**The Heart as the Good Depth.**
The stillness of stagnant water is a depth,
the flow of moving water is a depth,
and the discernment of the *guīhuáng* is a depth.
Thus, the heart is the Good Depth.

**Giving is Good Kindness, Speech is Good Trustworthiness.**
It overflows without filling,
it pours without exhausting—
thus, to give is Good Kindness.

It ventures upon dangers without failing in trust—
thus, speech is Good Trustworthiness.

**Governance is Good Governance.**
Its branches become rivers and valleys,
its gathering becomes the seas—
sufficient for governance, it is Good Governance.

**Action is Good Skill.**
Good governance: nothing is softer or weaker than water,
yet nothing surpasses it in overcoming the firm and strong.
Thus, in action, it is Good Skill.

**Movement is Good Timing.**
Sources gush ceaselessly, day and night,
filling the basin before advancing.
Only by not contending
does one avoid blame.

In essence, to emerge without contending
and to take dwelling as foundation—
thus it is said:
*Only by not contending*
*does one take first place under heaven.*

**Wáng Yuànzé said:**
*The Supreme Good is like water.*
Water is the first of the Five Phases,
emerging from emptiness into substance.
Not far from the Dao, its nature is closest to it.

For when one departs from the Dao, virtue is established,
and the Supreme Good is like water—
a natural principle of things.

Water’s virtue is in its utility—
it nearly attains the Dao.

Humans have two hearts—fire—
fire ascends and shines,
and thus they love to contend.
Only when the will aligns with the Dao
can one transcend things without the heart overcoming them.

**Residing in the Good Place.**
Descending and flowing.

**The Heart as the Good Depth.**
Deep, still, and level—
internally bright, externally obscured.

**Governance is Good Governance.**
Following nature rather than emotion,
accumulating softness to bear great weight.

**Action is Good Skill.**
Adapting to change—
thus, nothing is beyond its ability.

**Movement is Good Timing.**
If obstructed, it stops;
if released, it flows.
It does not move before things,
yet it does not lose its timing.

Only by not contending
does one avoid blame.

Water’s unity is unassailable by things,
and thus it encompasses these virtues.

For it has virtue toward things
while always descending before them—
this is why it has virtue.

If one were to willfully seek virtue,
they could not fulfill it.

Thus, the text concludes by reiterating this.

**Liú Shēnpíng said:**
*The Supreme Good is like water.*
Emerging from non-being into being,
dwelling in what is despised without contending,
yet benefiting things—
water’s use here is nearest to the Supreme Good.

When the heart embodies this, its name is established,
and so it is said to be *like* water.

**Giving is Good Kindness, Governance is Good Governance.**
Yet water itself has no governance—
why then speak of trustworthiness and governance?

Because in discussing the virtuous person as water,
we extend governance to the virtuous person as well.

**Movement is Good Timing.**
Virtue inheres in water,
and exhausts itself in my own goodness.

Goodness is goodness—
thus, to dwell is to rest in the Good Place,
the heart to abide in the Good Depth,
giving to balance Good Kindness,
speech to uphold Good Trustworthiness,
action to deploy Good Skill,
movement to follow Good Timing.

From *Záshuō*:
*Movement is Good Timing*—
for it moves in accordance with time,
and this is the goodness of movement.

The *Shū* also says:
*"Consider well before acting,
and act only in its proper time."*

The *Shī* praises Nán Zhòng’s thin assault on the Western Róng,
yet speaks of the chirping grass insects and the leaping *fúzhōng*—
for their movement follows its response.

If one does not move in accordance with time,
how could one attain this?

**Liú Jùjì said:**
*The Supreme Good is like water.*

The *Yì* says: *"What follows the Dao is virtue."*
The *Zhuāngzǐ* says: *"To depart from the Dao is to establish virtue."*
Both mean that from the Dao downward,
none are closer to virtue than this.

Virtue without its own virtue—
this is the Supreme Good,
like the Supreme Virtue’s goodness.

Water’s virtue is in its utility—
it nearly attains the Dao.

The Dao generates Oneness,
Oneness generates Water—
thus, water is near the Dao.

Water’s virtue is in its moistening—
this is called *utility*.
Good timing is called *not contending*.
Descending is called *dwelling in what is despised*.

To benefit others without boasting
is like water’s utility without contending.

To place oneself below others
is like water dwelling where others abhor.

The Dao also benefits all things without contending,
dwelling where others abhor—
and water is like this.

If water is like the Dao,
then the Supreme Good is like water.

This is why it is near the Dao.

**Residing in the Good Place.**
Virtue takes dwelling in lowliness as its place,
water takes descending as its place—
in virtue, it attains water’s place,
and so it is said: *Residing in the Good Place.*

**The Heart as the Good Depth.**
Virtue takes stillness as its heart,
water takes depth and stillness as its depth—
in virtue, it attains water’s depth,
and so it is said: *The Heart as the Good Depth.*

**Giving is Good Kindness, Speech is Good Trustworthiness.**
Virtue takes teaching others as giving,
water takes benefiting things as kindness—
in virtue, it attains water’s kindness,
and so it is said: *Giving is Good Kindness.*

Virtue takes honesty as speech,
water takes venturing upon dangers without failing in trust—
in water, it attains water’s trustworthiness,
and so it is said: *Speech is Good Trustworthiness.*

**Governance is Good Governance.**
Virtue takes rectifying oneself and others as governance,
water takes stirring and separating the pure and turbid as governance—
in virtue, it attains water’s governance,
and so it is said: *Governance is Good Governance.*

**Action is Good Skill.**
Virtue takes harmony as action,
water takes rounding and squaring without obstruction as skill—
in virtue, it attains water’s skill,
and so it is said: *Action is Good Skill.*

**Movement is Good Timing.**
Water takes winter congealing and spring thawing as timing,
in virtue attains water’s timing,
and so it is said: *Movement is Good Timing.*

Only the non-contending is without blame.
It is said that the highest virtue should be like water,
for non-contending is the highest virtue.

To make non-contending advantageous,
one can thus embrace these seven virtues
and be aided by Heaven and assisted by humankind.
What fault could there be?

The previous chapter spoke of the Sage’s matters beyond the body,
and since the six virtues do not contend,
they are followed by the six virtues.

Liu Ji said: *"The highest virtue is like water, hence without blame."*
The *Yijing* says: *"Those who follow the Way are virtuous."*
*Zhuangzi* also says: *"To depart from the Way is to be virtuous."*
All say that from the Dao downward, none approach virtue as closely.

Heaven’s One generates water,
yet it is not far from the Way,
so the highest virtue is like water.

Water’s virtue benefits all things—
though supremely yielding and weak,
it does not contend.
It dwells where people dislike,
thus nearly attaining the Way.

Those who dwell in good land
place themselves beneath others.
Those whose hearts are virtuous depths
are clear through stillness.
Those who give with virtue are benevolent,
benefiting others without seeking return.
Those whose speech is virtuous are trustworthy,
venturing upon dangers without failing in trust.

Next, it flows; when contained, it stops—
virtue’s governance is good governance.
Filling basins and advancing,
a thousand turns yet it flows east—
virtue’s skill is good skill.
Source springs, ceaseless day and night—
movement is good timing.

Embracing these seven virtues without contending with things,
there is no blame.
This is how it nearly attains the Way.

Only the Way gathers in emptiness while water flows downward,
naturally without the burden of excess,
so it is followed by *"Hold and it will be full."*

Zhao Shizhen said: *"First, the analogy of two things: one, yielding succession to the Way.
The highest virtue is like water—
as the previous chapter says, it is not without private intent,
yet it accomplishes its private intent.
It clarifies how Heaven, Earth, and the Sage
achieve public good through private means.
He who can achieve public good through private means
truly understands the mechanisms of Heaven and humankind,
and goes nowhere without fitting in.
This is the highest virtue.
Thus it is said: *The highest virtue is like water.*

For benevolence is the root of virtue,
righteousness is its foundation,
rites are its adornment,
trust is its depth,
wisdom is its refinement.
Each has its virtue, yet none exhausts virtue.
Only water’s virtue encompasses all seven,
so it is called the highest virtue.
Virtue is all-encompassing.
All-encompassing means fully prepared—
this is why it is the highest virtue.
Thus, *the highest virtue is like water.*

The commentary cites *Zhuangzi*: *"To depart from the Way is to be virtuous."*
When virtue is named, the body of the Way is diminished,
yet Heaven’s One generates water,
and departing from the Way is not far.
This again reveals the meaning of the highest virtue.

**Two, directly pointing to water’s virtue.**
Water’s virtue benefits all—
thus it nearly attains the Way.
Previously, virtue was compared to water;
now water’s virtue is spoken of directly.

The Five Phases: Metal generates Water.
Where Metal is generated, Water inherits its form and precedes it,
thus not departing from its mother.
Yet Water is born from *Kan* (the abyss),
*Kan* resides in the *zi* position,
the Yellow Palace nurtures its qi—
this is its proper place.
The lands it encompasses
are where the divine response resides within.
*The Hongfan* says: Heaven’s One generates Water,
Earth’s Two generates Fire,
Fire is born from Water’s essence—*jingyi*.
The divine is in the essence,
the divine response follows as the second,
three Yangs are born from Water,
Water descends while Wind ascends.
Three Yins are born from Wind,
Wind ascends while Water descends.
Yin and Yang merge in virtue,
divine responses interact and apply—
though one Yin and one Yang,
one Wind and one Water,
their origin is Heaven’s One as the root,
so Water rises as vapor to become clouds,
clouds transform into rain,
all things thrive from Water and are born.
Water’s benefit is for all under Heaven,
thus it is said: *Water’s virtue benefits all things,*
and it does not contend.
Again, one phrase cannot exhaust its virtue,
so it is restated.

Non-contending is Water’s yielding nature.
Yielding is顺 (*shùn*),顺 is not opposing things,
thus it communicates with all.
*Mencius* says: *"Direct it east, it flows east;
direct it west, it flows west.
Draw it, and it reaches—*
all this is the work of yielding.
Yet Water’s nature is to descend,
while human inclination favors ascent.
Those who favor ascent dislike descent,
and disliking descent is the common inclination.
Descending is to dwell in lowliness—
lowliness is the virtue of the highest.
He who cannot dwell in lowliness will contend,
contending means to precede others,
preceding others means he cannot transcend his body.
Transcending the body means he can be humble and modest—
this aligns with what was said before.
Thus it is said: *It dwells where people dislike,*
hence it nearly attains the Way.
*Near* means *close*.
The commentary says: *The Yijing* says: *"One Yin, one Yang—this is the Way;
those who follow it are virtuous."*
Thus it is known that none approach the Way as closely as virtue.
Yet the Way is vast, seeming unworthy,
and the world dares not submit to it—
subtle, beyond grasp,
no thing can compare.
Only Water’s lowliness
can nearly approach it.

Next, the seven virtues are elaborated:

**One, the virtue of harmonizing.**
Dwelling in good land—
Water and Earth together encompass,
yet when divided, Earth is still while Water moves.
Earth’s nature restrains Water,
but when Water overflows, Earth builds dikes.
Earth cultivates grains,
Water irrigates—
thus Earth succeeds through Water.
Initially, they share one breath—
brothers.
After division, they are husband and wife.
If not restrained, the six would not generate,
and harmony would not produce creation.
Thus Water moves upon the land—
Water’s benefit lies in the land.
Land is lowliness,
Water is descent.
Water and Earth share virtue,
and cannot be separated for an instant—
this is why they harmonize virtues.
Harmonizing virtues returns to their origin.
Unlike the Way,
they do not differ and do not conspire against each other.
Thus, level land levels Water and Earth,
and it is known that Water dwells in good land.

**御注曰:**
Dwelling upon the land, it flows in the center yet never overflows.
**Two,** its essence is clarity and stillness—
its heart is profoundly serene.

Those with nature possess a heart;
those without feeling lack a heart—
Water has no feeling,
so how could it have a heart?
The *Classic* speaks of a heart
only by analogy to human mind in Water.

The heart is the **Dao/Way**.
The **Dao/Way** arises from the heart;
when the heart is still, all forms perish—
thus its depths are boundless,
unseen and unfathomable.
Yet when the heart stirs and spirit awakens,
the **Dao/Way** scatters as things—
how could it fully manifest its use?

"Serene" means deep—
also "serene" means void.
The heart’s emptiness holds the principle of profound stillness,
so the deeper it is measured,
the farther it extends.
Zhuangzi said: *"Serene and still."*
Does this not illuminate Water’s heart?

When unmoved, it is clear;
when undisturbed, it is level—
here, even eyebrows and mustaches are revealed.
The heavy and turbid settle below,
the pure and bright rise above—
all things rest here.
These are the meanings of profound stillness.

**Three,** its virtue is to nurture life—
its excellence is benevolence.
Those with hearts give without favor;
those without hearts distribute evenly—
Water’s impartiality
reaches the utmost benevolence.
Water makes no choice,
yet virtue flows universally.
The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"Kàn has sincerity—its heart is flourishing."*
With one *yang* dwelling between two *yin*,
if one cannot cultivate virtue and refine conduct
to depart from peril,
how could one show unceasing sincerity?
When in Kàn, one *yang* returns—
returning to reveal the heart of Heaven and Earth.
Heaven and Earth’s heart originates in nurturing life;
returning, it ceases.
Returning and ceasing,
it turns toward life.
The heart of universal love is the sage’s mind.
Without embodying the **Dao/Way**,
benevolence remains constrained—
like a drought’s meager dew,
how could it compare to Heaven’s timely rains?
Thus, even Yao and Shun found it laborious
to broadly bestow and aid the people.
Yet Water’s transformation,
sharing virtue with the **Dao/Way**,
is universally loving, impartial,
and gives without choice—
what could it not encompass?
Thus it is said: *"Its excellence is benevolence."*

**Four,** it has a central master—
speaking of faithfulness.
Roots and stems are the origin of things;
nature and life are what the **Dao/Way** generates.
Tracing its source,
following its inherent nature,
it does not deviate from principle.
The Five Phases attribute wisdom to Water,
faithfulness to Earth.
How does Water speak of faithfulness?
Observe *Fù*—seven days return,
*qi* transmits to *Zhōngfú* (faithfulness).
Kàn in *Fù* obtains *Zhōngfú* naturally—
this is why it is said to master faithfulness.
The *Tai Xuan* states:
One *yang* rides upon unity,
all things draw form from the center—
Water embodies *Zhōngfú*,
the central *yang qi* subtly illuminates the Yellow Palace—
faithfulness is never absent from the center.
Truly, the primal spirit’s subtlety lies in one *qi*,
the origin of myriad threads begins with wisdom—
the source of faithfulness obtains wisdom,
unifying speech and wisdom, action and faithfulness,
without losing harmony with things.
Wisdom does not inherently master faithfulness—
in affairs, hesitation breeds regret;
faithfulness is not wisdom in action—
in nature, it stagnates and falters.
Thus, the essence resides within,
manifestation lies without—
ultimate speech transcends speech,
great faithfulness requires no oaths,
so beginning and end are trustworthy,
not hollow and empty,
yet vast in reception.
Thus, it is known:
If one speaks without faithfulness in action,
one loses its root.
The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"Moving through peril without losing faithfulness"—
this is the reason.

**Five,** it follows principle in action—
governance excels in order.
The Great **Dao/Way** takes rationality as master;
governance precedes literature.
Since Heaven and Earth came to be,
no ruler over all things
has failed to exhaust principle and nature
yet still transformed the people.
The Three Sovereigns governed through spiritual transformation of the **Dao/Way**,
the Five Emperors ruled with benevolence aligned with Heaven—
and the world spoke of governance.
Yet who knows its root is as yielding as Water,
encountering nothing yet achieving transformation?
Those who arrogantly establish their own virtue
and disrupt the Great Constant
simply do not know the foundation of governance—
how could they avoid hardship and scarcity?
Water’s nature seeks lowliness and moisture,
flows through the earth,
bends a thousand times yet flows east,
avoids obstacles and reaches the sea—
this is Water’s principle.
Governance’s foundation in human nature
is like irrigation and cultivation—
movement and growth depend on it for life;
like rain and dew,
withering things rely on it for nourishment—
this is Water’s function.
Governance’s origin in sustaining life
is like cleansing filth and replacing it with purity,
receiving all impurities and replacing them with clarity—
this is Water’s virtue.
Governance’s excellence in guiding customs
is like dikes that can be extended,
yet rivers cannot be violated,
barriers that can be built,
yet torrents cannot be resisted—
this is Water’s power.
Governance conquers the world with yielding **Dao/Way**,
like springs flowing ceaselessly,
their currents vast and boundless—
the more drawn, the clearer,
the more issued, the fresher—
this is Water’s root.
Governance renews the world daily,
like Water’s inherent qualities—
all these it possesses,
thus its excellence in governance is clear.
Ah!
Nothing but Water.
Waves surge yet are not evil,
stillness is profound yet not beautiful—
though turbulent, it never loses its goodness;
purified, it is not stagnant;
stirred, it is not reckless;
raging, it never loses its longevity.
The Supreme Good says: *"The highest excellence is like Water."*
The sage embodies this for governance—
is this not universal wisdom?

**Six,** it adapts to the vessel’s round or square—
affairs excel in capability.
Effortless action yields few errors;
action with purpose yields no calamity is difficult.
Under Heaven, no affair remains still and unmoving.
When it moves,
responding to make it appropriate—
none but the wise and insightful
can decisively judge it.

**Water’s Nature—**
From Heaven’s single source it issues forth,
a ceaseless trickle,
until it fills the basin and then advances,
spreading across the Four Seas.
Observe it in the Two Yin*—
it can navigate peril;
one Yang* abides at its center—
its spirit flows freely.
Though it rests in Yin,
though it sinks into danger,
it never strays from peril—
flowing yet never full,
dwelling yet emerging,
its applications are vast.

Yet it never contends with things,
adapting to the land’s curves and straights—
not crooked for its own sake,
nor rigid without restraint.
It conforms to the vessel’s shape—
square without rigidity,
round without fixed form.
It responds to the myriad transformations of things
yet never loses its constancy;
it fits the timing of use
yet never falters in sincerity—
truly, it has no power
yet lacks no capability.

The Supreme Good’s work
is most evident here.

**Seven,** its flow and congealing have constancy.
Its movement is timely.
Under Heaven’s affairs,
the virtuous observe them for advance and retreat,
lying in the interplay of emergence and withdrawal.

Emerging at its proper time,
the sage acts and all things witness;
retiring by the Dao/Way,
the hidden dragon* yields to the wind* and frets in obscurity.
When one should emerge yet withdraws,
rolling up like a scroll—
this is the way of the unvirtuous.
When one should retire yet emerges,
forcing action—
this is the way of the unwise.

Knowing the Dao/Way of advance and retreat,
never losing its proper time,
then movement is auspicious.

*The *Book of Documents* says:
*"Consider well and act,
act only when the time is ripe."*

As for Water’s movement—
when Yang releases it, it floats;
when Yin congeals it, it becomes ice.
Within one body, it holds Yang within and Yin without;
in spring and winter, it has motion and stillness.
Thus, those who move with adaptability
respond to the *Yù* timing*—auspicious;
those who move with clarity
respond to the *Fēng* timing*—auspicious;
those who move with daring
respond to the *Jiě* timing*—auspicious;
those who move with strength
respond to the *Dàzhuàng* timing*—auspicious.

The ancients hid their talents within,
awaiting the proper time;
advanced their virtue and cultivated their affairs,
seeking to grasp the moment;
refined their conduct and guarded their actions,
waiting for the right season;
understood the fitting approach,
desiring to settle in harmony;
withdrew into obscurity and rested in seclusion,
following the times.

By the times’ unfolding,
even Heaven does not resist—
as for those skilled in nurturing life,
they press forward and then respond;
those who master the art of interaction,
advance and retreat at the proper moments.

If one dwells in the world yet knows not emergence and withdrawal,
pursues the True yet fails to recognize floating and sinking—
how then can one attain the meaning of timely action?

**Later, congealing forms two principles:**
**One,** the summation of yielding and adaptability.
Truly, non-contention is Water’s nature;
inherent in gentleness and weakness is Water’s virtue/power.
In non-contention’s excellence,
the advantage of non-contention is seen in the Seven Affairs.
In governing one’s self,
it does not use strength to conquer others.
In dwelling within one’s self,
it fits just what is needed to guard with gentleness—
if it can be assailed,
if it can be scorned,
then those who endure slander are drowned,
those who endure impurity are sullied.
Yet the patient endure scorn,
the clear grow slowly from turbid—
none can ultimately overcome its gentleness.

Can Water’s force, descending to the low,
become what all people despise?
Yet it never knows to dwell low while serving high?
Can Water’s nature, gentle and weak,
be overcome by the strong?
Yet it never knows to gather in gentleness
and use it—then it becomes strong.

When it is nurtured,
it flows as a trickle,
yet when it surges,
none can restrain its non-contention—
the Dao/Way few can wield it.

**Two,** without the breath of human Dao/Way,
there is no blame.
The strong oppress the weak,
the many bully the few—
all take upon themselves the fault of their strength.
Yet the gentle Dao/Way moves with harmony,
and none find fault in it.

As *Shào Ruò* said:
*"The Supreme Good is like Water—
thus there is no blame."*

All people love contention,
yet Laozi sets non-contention as the Supreme Good,
using Water as an analogy—
Water has no desire of its own,
yet benefits all things without contention,
dwelling where all people despise it.

By Water’s virtue/power,
it nearly attains the Dao/Way.
If one acts without desire,
then non-contention is auspicious;
dwelling without desire,
then stillness is auspicious;
with others without desire,
then benevolence is auspicious;
speaking without desire,
then sincerity is auspicious;
governing without desire,
then administration is auspicious;
doing without desire,
then capability is auspicious;
moving without desire,
then timing is auspicious.

Truly, without desire,
non-contention is auspicious—
thus there is no blame.

As *Wáng Zhìrán* said:
*"The Supreme Good is like Water—
thus there is no blame."*

The Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Principles*,
the Two Principles generate the Four Symbols*,
the Four Symbols generate the Five Phases*,
and the Five Phases’ transformations are vast.

In Heaven, they become the Five Stars*;
on Earth, they become the Five Mountains*;
in humans, they are called the Five Constants*;
in the body, they are the Five Viscera*.
Applied to colors, they are the Five Hues*;
applied to music, they are the Five Tones*;
the tongue savors them as the Five Flavors*;
the nose perceives them as the Five Fragrances*—
each reaching its full use,
called the Five Talents*.

Mutually generating and mutually restraining,
alternately waxing and waning,
yet benefiting all things without contention,
dwelling where all people despise it without refusal—
its functions are beyond naming,
thus those who nearly attain the Dao/Way,
only Water can do so.

Why?
Water’s nature can be both gentle and strong,
both round and square,
both crooked and straight,
both short and long—
melting into rivers,
congealing into ice,
gathering as seas,
dispersing as clouds.
All myriad things draw from it to live,
all treasures obtain it to form.
Its source is boundless,
its flow ceaseless—
Heaven’s first creation,
not far from the Dao/Way.

Having marked the name of the Supreme Good,
which of all myriad things is better than this?
Thus it is said: *"Under Heaven, none are gentler and weaker than Water,
yet none are better at overcoming the firm and strong."*
Its non-contention and victory are such—
as for its flowing, dispersing, and shifting,
it chooses no place yet finds rest;
in the level, it measures and applies;
it receives filth and absorbs stains,
full yet never overflowing—
this is what is called *"dwelling in auspicious places."*

The Sage who dwells in stillness
marks no reflection in flowing waters,
yet mirrors all in stillness—
stillness, then clarity,
returning to the origin, pure and true.
None can surpass the Supreme Void—
this is called *"the heart’s deep virtue."*

To love universally without favor,
to know all yet never exhaust—
to take virtue as kindness,
is it not to make oneself small?
This is called *"the benevolent in harmony."*

Straight speech, though reversed,
is plain as water, tasteless yet profound.
Unsummoned, it gathers;
uninvited, it arrives—
this is called *"speech’s true faith."*

To curb the excesses of Zeng and Shi,
to silence Yang and Mo’s mouths—
if all hold such wisdom, Heaven’s confusion ceases;
if all embody such virtue, Heaven’s misguidance ends.
This is called *"governance’s perfect order."*

Abandon the wise, discard cleverness—
great thieves then desist.
Abandon artifice, discard profit—
the people’s gain is a hundredfold.
Acting with the times, all undertakings succeed—
this is called *"the adept in action."*

Spring’s thaw, winter’s freeze—
the seasons’ natural course;
exploiting terrain for benefit—
the way of forces.
Dammed, it stops; released, it flows.
Guide the people with the times,
and movement aligns with what is fitting—
this is called *"action’s timely flow."*

To dwell well is to rest in ease,
to nurture the heart is to dwell in depth and stillness,
to act benevolently is to give without reserve,
to speak truly is to stand firm in faith,
to govern wisely is to bring order and stability,
to act skillfully is to exhaust one’s capacity,
to move rightly is to follow the seasons’ lead—
this is how the Sage embodies and practices them.

To govern the world and state,
in sorrow share the people’s sorrow,
in joy share the people’s joy.
To act without action, few desires—easy;
to act with action, yet incur no blame—difficult.
If one can embody Water’s supreme utility,
and follow Water’s nature,
benefiting myriad ages without knowing how—
to profit others without contention,
while none can contend with it—
then there is no blame.

Huang Maozai said:
*"The Supreme Good, like Water, thus incurs no blame."*

Water has seven grades of goodness:
The highest—
to benefit others without contention,
to dwell where others abhor—
this is the Supreme Good.
If one embodies this, one nears the Dao.

Its lesser grades, sevenfold:
To dwell in auspicious places—
to pool as marshes;
to nurture a deep heart—
stillness can reflect;
to act benevolently—
its nourishing reach is vast;
to speak truly—
its voice, once stirred, never ceases;
to govern wisely—
it can cleanse filth and reveal essence;
to act skillfully—
it shapes square and round as needed;
to move with the times—
freezing in winter, thawing in spring.

Though these seven may make a good person,
none surpass the non-contention of Water—
non-contention, thus no blame.

Program Tai said:
*"The Supreme Good, like Water, thus does not contend."*

All things under Heaven that benefit others—
if I take them alone, another must be deprived,
and my gain is their loss.
Contention begins here.

Water’s virtue:
it does not seek to benefit others,
yet does not refuse to do so.
It can boil, irrigate, cleanse, or bear—
acting only when the time is right,
so benefit arises without harm elsewhere—
no contention exists.

The Supreme Good is the good beyond good.
To dwell among the people is to near the Dao.
Before movement, it is non-being;
in its manifestation over all things, it is emptiness.
When it meets events and reveals itself,
it does not seek fullness,
but is moist, weak, lowly, and yielding.
Though not yet the Dao,
when used with force,
it does not enter excess—
thus it attains emptiness and tends toward non-being.
This is the closest approach to the Dao.

Though some know the benefit of humility and weakness,
private pride cannot be overcome—
how could one willingly bend, endure humiliation,
and walk the path of humility and weakness?

Only Water is good at yielding without contention,
receiving filth without refusal,
and in human affairs,
all that is deemed base or shameful—
it endures and contains them.
Though not yet the Dao,
its inner emptiness and selflessness
are the essential path for those seeking it.

**Dwelling in auspicious places:**
*"Residence"* refers to where it gathers—
low and sunken is its dwelling,
thus great rivers flow downward—
hence, *"auspicious places."*

**The heart’s deep virtue:**
Never ceasing to move yet profoundly still—
this is its heart.

**Benevolent harmony:**
Its nourishment reaches everywhere without limit.

**True speech:**
In matters, some should speak yet remain silent,
some should be magnified yet are diminished,
some should be made plain yet are exaggerated—
these are not as they should be.
Water’s still pools make no sound,
yet the world calls them *"profound silence."*
When stirred, it makes noise—
great agitation brings great sound,
small agitation brings small sound—
each encounter is thus—
this is called *"faith."*

**Perfect order:**
*"Governance"* corrects what is incorrect.
Once cleansed, external filth is gone,
and the original nature is revealed—
this is its order.

**Adept in action:**
Its balanced levelness, its inner clarity—
its skill is revealed in action.

**Timely movement:**
When blocked, it stops;
when released, it flows.
In cold, it freezes;
in thaw, it descends—
it acts as circumstances demand.

Only because it does not contend
is there no blame.
Responding without initiating,
acting where there is none—
though its utility reaches others,
it does not take from them,
so none can harm what it does—
thus the seven goods are not merely Water’s talents.
Since it does not contend,
none blame it,
and its Supreme Good is easily achieved.

**Discourse on Eighty-One Chapters: Sixfold Elucidation of the Benefits of Non-Contention**

First, it is said:
*"He who does not vaunt himself has merit,
He who does not boast endures long.
Only because he does not contend,
the world cannot contend with him."*
This is the first.

Second:
*"To place oneself above others yet serve them,
To precede others yet follow them—
because he does not contend,
the world cannot contend with him."*
This is the second.

Third:
*"The Way of Heaven acts without contention yet achieves victory."*

Fourth:
*"The Sage’s Way acts without contention."*

Fifth:
*"To wage war without force,
To win without claiming victory—
this is the virtue of non-contention."*

Sixth:
*"Thus, the sixfold non-contention incurs no blame."*

Now, what is called *contention* is not necessarily war or battle.
When two opposing forces refuse to yield—
this is contention.
Though Heaven’s yin and yang are most subtle and ungraspable,
they still contend at the winter and summer solstices—
for the departing force has not withdrawn,
while the incoming force presses forward.
This is called contention.
Thus, contention is when opposing forces arise and neither yields.

But those who grasp the Dao are otherwise.
Knowing to embrace the feminine while guarding the masculine,
they act yet do not act.
Their abilities could benefit others, yet they withhold them;
their wisdom could overshadow the world, yet they conceal it.
They never seek to lead the world first—
how then could there be contention?

Indeed, Liezi spoke of the Dao of perpetual victory and perpetual defeat:
*"The ancients spoke of strength—
those who do not yet surpass me,
when they surpass me, are in peril.
To surpass me and yet be in peril—
this is one who loves victory and must meet his match,
and thus must surely be defeated."*

Again, he said:
*"The gentle one—
those who act first perish,
while those who do not contend face no peril.
Thus, their victory is certain."*

Pushing this logic to its extreme:
Even if two armies clash and I win,
it may still be called non-contention.
I wait in gentleness until the moment of collapse,
then strike—
and this too is non-contention.
Thus is the Dao of perpetual victory.

Yet this is perpetual victory from my perspective alone.
I advance when advantageous,
and withdraw when not—
prioritizing self-cultivation over benefiting others.
Though Laozi’s words are profound,
his approach preserves the self at all costs,
only acting when peril is absent.
Otherwise, he refrains.

Indeed, many ancient scholars were like this.
Morning Gate mocked Confucius:
*"Is this not knowing the impossible yet doing it?"*
The man with the basket also said:
*"How vulgar! Stubborn and unrecognized—
this is enough!"*
These two, though concerned with the world,
when they found none to align with them,
simply let things be.

All such doubts belong to the Daoist path,
those unwilling to take action.

But Confucius was otherwise.
Hearing the basket-man’s words, he sighed:
*"Ah, the end is indeed difficult!"*
Though loving one’s life while neglecting the world
was not beyond Confucius,
he prioritized saving the world—
approaching what must be approached,
never shirking what must be done.
Thus, the Five Approaches, the Five Withdrawals,
and the seventy-two visits—
all bore the world upon his shoulders.

Though Laozi’s view was not without merit,
Confucius endured what he could not.
If measured by self-preservation,
misfortune and disgrace could not touch him.
Thus, he was spared the fate of being hacked to pieces or felled like wood.

Zhan Qiupu said:
*"The Supreme Good resembles water—
thus it incurs no blame."*
In the chapter *"Changing Nature,"*
it says to replace my nature with water’s nature of benefiting others—
hence, *"The Supreme Good resembles water."*
Water benefits all things without contention.

Yet water, though it benefits all,
when it floods or dries, harms them.
Only by dwelling where others abhor
does it nearly approach the Dao.

Why?
The body thrives on level ground,
the mind on depth.
Deep and still, it aligns with broad benevolence.
Speech thrives on trust,
governance on rectitude,
action on timely opportunity.
All these harmonize self and others,
bringing ease—
thus the world naturally holds no grievance.

Moreover, human nature is inherently good.
Why then compare the Supreme Good to water?
This is the most natural of transformations,
yet it is sought through analogy.

Zhang Chongying said:
*"The Supreme Good resembles water—
thus it incurs no blame."*
Water’s nature is lowly and yielding.
Probed, it is empty;
observed, it is clear.
In Heaven, it becomes rain or dew;
on Earth, rivers and streams.
The moving rely on it to float,
the rooted rely on it to grow,
the impure rely on it to cleanse,
the rigid rely on it to soften—
all things depend on it to flourish.
Thus all things turn to it,
all are nourished by its grace,
yet there is no contention—
no *"this may enter, that may not."*

The common folk—
the world’s masses—
who does not revere the high and despise the low,
who does not wield rigidity to humiliate the gentle?
They fail to see that water’s lowliness and yielding
hold a wondrous efficacy—
nothing resists it.

When a person’s nature aligns with water’s nature,
they become the Supreme Good.
Thus, its subtlety grows daily with the Dao.
Wherever they dwell, they nourish and flow—
dwelling in the best places.
In the heart, they are empty, clear, and profound—
the mind is deeply settled.

When applied to things, it nurtures them to completion—
thus aligning with virtue and benevolence.
When expressed in speech, it is true and unfeigned—
thus aligning with sincerity and trust.
When used to rectify others, it clarifies right from wrong—
naturally clear and just—
thus aligning with righteous governance.
When applied to affairs, it adapts to square and round, straight and curved,
responding flexibly yet appropriately—
thus aligning with skillful action.

At dawn and dusk, day and night,
rising and falling, ebbing and flowing—
it neither depletes nor overacts,
moving only at the proper time.

When the seven virtues are complete,
silently operating within,
evil nature fades while virtuous nature arises—
thus, no contention with others,
no blame to bear.

This is called: *"Only the non-contending thus has no blame."*

White Crane of Jade said:
*"The Supreme Good is like water.
Its nature is like water—
water is good.
It is not hindered by things—
benefiting all things yet not contending.
What initial motive could there be?
It dwells where others revile—
to me, what matter is there?
Thus, it approaches the Dao.
The heart is likewise:
dwelling in the best places,
choosing nothing.
The heart is deeply settled—
nurtured by something.
Aligning with virtue and benevolence—
no distinction between self and other.
Speech aligns with sincerity—
true and real.
Governance aligns with righteousness—
nowhere unrighteous.
Affairs align with skill—
effortless yet nothing left undone.
Action aligns with timing—
moving with the times.
Only the non-contending—
the mind uncompeting.
Thus, no blame.
Nor is this taken as fortune."*

Liao Cuiran said:
*"The Supreme Good is like water.
The Dao’s wondrous operation,
like water’s flow.
Water benefits all things yet does not contend.
Through its yielding weakness,
it submits to all things.
Dwelling where others revile—
the common folk use it daily without knowing,
this is the Dao’s essence.
Thus, it approaches the Dao.
It may be called the True Constant.
Dwelling in the best places—
thus able to remain balanced.
The heart is deeply settled—
the mind ever-clear, perpetually pure.
Aligning with virtue and benevolence—
benefiting all beings.
Speech aligns with sincerity—
meaning uprightness.
Governance aligns with righteousness—
ever upholding fairness.
Affairs align with skill—
pure Dao qi in action.
Action aligns with timing—
movement and rest in measure.
Only the non-contending—
submitting to all uses, never opposing.
Thus, no blame.
No lingering resentment.
If one follows this,
thus the Dao is achieved."*

Chen Bixu said:
*"The Supreme Good is like water.
The Supreme Good is the standard for humanity.
'Like water' is a metaphor.
The perfected one holds an empty heart, no desires,
adapting to change with the times,
not opposing any conditions,
dwelling in goodness while forgetting goodness.
Thus, it is called Supreme Good.
Water can conform to square and round,
deep and shallow, floating and sinking,
following the Dao, embracing emptiness—
all things have their principles.
Only the sage encompasses and harmonizes them.
Thus, it is called 'like water.'

Moreover, water embodies the three near-Dao abilities,
the seven virtues benefiting things—
as elaborated below.
Water benefits all things supremely,
thus approaching the Dao.
This is the first near-Dao ability.
Water’s nature is tranquil and even,
spreading nourishment everywhere—
heaven without water brings drought,
earth without water raises dust.
It benefits all things,
thus it is called 'beneficial.'
This is the first ability.
Nothing is softer or weaker than water,
abandoning solidity for emptiness,
rejecting high for low—
blocked, it stops;
unblocked, it flows,
submitting to others.
Thus, it is called 'non-contending.'
This is the second ability.
Human nature dislikes lowliness,
prefers high positions,
yet water seeks the base, receives filth,
dwelling in evil without disorder,
making things pure and white,
alone bearing defilement and humiliation.
Thus, it is called 'dwelling where others revile.'
This is the third ability.

*'Near'* means *approaching*.
Water’s beneficence broadens its benevolence,
non-contention radiates its virtue,
dwelling in evil expands its tolerance—
the three abilities of water’s nature.
Only the perfected one’s unified virtue and conduct
thus approach the Dao without straying.
Hence, it is called *near.*

Further explanation:
Water is the origin of *qi*,
ruling the North.
Its number is six.
The North is the beginning of yang virtue,
the end of yin qi.
The generating number is one,
matching the Dao.
The Dao is also called *one*—
the *one* of non-*one*.
Water’s *one* is the *one* of *having one*.
The *one* of non-*one* is the Dao’s essence,
the *one* of *having one* is the Dao’s function.
Thus, water is the Dao’s function,
hence it is said to *approach the Dao.*

From *dwelling in the best places* to *action aligns with timing*—
the perfected one’s dwelling is in humble submission,
following things naturally,
transforming even the neighborhood,
like water on earth,
dwelling in lowliness,
nourishing all things.
Thus, it is said: *dwelling in the best places.*
This is the first virtue.

The perfected one’s heart preserves emptiness and stillness,
penetrates profundity,
deeply clear and unobstructed,
like a watery abyss,
waves flowing in nine transformations,
never losing clarity and stillness.
Thus, it is said: *the heart is deeply settled.*
This is the second virtue.

The perfected one, if practicing virtue and benevolence,
benefits all under heaven,
without partiality,
like water’s oily nourishment,
skillfully ascending and descending,
nothing left untouched.
Thus, it is said: *aligning with virtue and benevolence.*
This is the third virtue.

The perfected one’s speech upholds sincerity,
does not bargain with things,
naturally harmonious,
like water’s reflection—
beauty and ugliness make no difference,
flowing and filling, it moves,
risky yet unerring.
Thus, it is said: *speech aligns with sincerity.*
This is the fourth virtue.

The perfected one governing affairs
rectifies the people,
upright in demeanor, understanding things,
things naturally comply,
like water’s clarity and balance,
skillfully settling high and low,
purifying all things,
leaving no filth.
Thus, it is said: *governance aligns with righteousness.*
This is the fifth virtue.

The perfected one, when handling affairs,
skillfully employs things,
assigning roles according to ability,
losing none of their potential.
Like water’s yielding nature,
skillfully serving square and round,
adapting to form and vessel,
nothing left unfinished.
Thus, it is said: *affairs align with skill.*
This is the sixth virtue.

The sage’s movement and stillness
observe the proper time,
emerging and retiring according to circumstances,
preserving the Dao,
like water’s movement—
skillfully adapting to change,
freezing in winter, flowing in summer,
never missing its measure.
Thus, it is said: *action aligns with timing.*"

The seventh virtue is thus said: *movement aligns with timing.*

This concludes the threefold discourse of the perfected one’s seven virtues. For the perfected one alone—
the one who does not vie—
there is no blame.

The perfected one’s thoughts, actions, comings, goings, words, and silences
all harmonize with the **Mysterious Dao**,
conform to what is fitting,
and perpetually maintain **feminine stillness**,
never contending with things.

If things are not contended with,
how could there be any ground for blame?

Moreover, *blame* is *resentment*.
It is said that in the world,
only the one who does not vie
has none to resent or blame.

**Xie Tuonan** said:
*The highest virtue is like water, approaching the Dao.*

The **Dao of the Great Learning** lies in stopping at the highest virtue.
This is called *highest virtue*—
its utmost is here.

**Mencius** said:
*Human nature has no unvirtuous aspect,
just as water has no place but to descend.*
The **Classics** state:
*Only because the rivers and seas can descend
do they become rulers over all the valleys.*
Thus, when virtue is likened to water,
it is taken from its ability to descend.

Only when a person can descend
do all virtues gather to them.
Only when water can descend
do all streams gather to it.
Their tendency is the same.

Water nourishes all things without contending,
its benefit lies in benefiting others, not itself.
What the multitude abhors—
low, vile, sunken places—
water delights in, moving naturally,
without choice or preference.
Thus, it approaches the Dao.
Though this speaks of water,
its true intent is for the virtuous person.

The virtuous person dwelling in the highest virtue
has no blame.

High and low without preference,
thus dwelling in the highest virtue.
Clear and pure, unshaken,
thus the heart is virtuous in the depths.
Take as you will, give as you will,
thus it is virtuous in kindness.
If not level, it resounds,
thus it is virtuous in truthfulness.
It reflects beauty and ugliness,
thus governance is virtuous in regulation.
It bears weight, it floats weight,
thus affairs are virtuous in capability.
Its flow is unceasing,
thus movement is virtuous in timing.

If benefit is so vast,
if achievement is so great,
yet it never contends with things,
how could there be blame or resentment?

Though this speaks of water’s virtue,
it truly speaks of human virtue.
Virtue is water—
none other than the Dao’s abiding presence.

Indeed, it has been discussed:
*Heaven first generates water,*
*water is the origin of the Five Phases,*
*none is more exalted than water.*
Water flows through the earth,
nourishing all things—
none is greater than water.
Exalted yet not claiming its exaltation,
great yet not possessing its greatness—
this is why virtue does not vie,
and why, not vying, there is no blame.

The virtuous person’s virtue,
if they befriend the virtue of one village, still consider it insufficient,
if they befriend the virtue of one nation, still consider it insufficient,
yet if they befriend the virtue of the world,
then they may attain the highest virtue.

Yet, the highest virtue is fitting to share with others,
just as rivers and streams do not boast of the world,
flowing together with the muddy—
not proud, not boastful—
and the world has none to contend with them.
Thus, human virtue is water’s virtue.

Water’s virtue is the Dao’s virtue.
The Dao dwells within me—
turn inward to seek it,
nurturing virtue in the **Mingyuan**,
harmonizing **qi** in the **Xianzai**,
and gathering its power in the **Water-Fire** of *Ji* and *Wei*.
In the end,
virtue dwells within me,
water dwells within me.

If I use this virtue well,
I may share in the Dao’s enduring presence.
If not, what is water?
What is water?
Why liken it to water?

**Lin Yongzhai** said:
*The highest virtue is like water, approaching the Dao.*
This chapter again uses water to illustrate the thought of having no self.
The highest virtue is the utmost virtue.
It is said that the world’s highest virtue
is the same as water’s nature.

Water’s virtue can benefit all things,
yet when has it ever considered itself capable?
Following the flow without opposing—
this is not vying.
Descending to low places, embracing dampness—
it does not regard what the world abhors as abhorrent.
Thus, observing water,
one comes near to the Dao.

*Approaching* means *near*.
Dwelling in the highest virtue—
it speaks of dwelling there and finding peace.
The heart is virtuous in the depths—
it speaks of its steadfastness and tranquility.
Kindness extends to all—
it speaks of its kindness reaching everywhere.
Truthfulness in speech—
it speaks of words always aligning with reality.
Governance is virtuous in regulation—
using it to govern the state,
the state will surely be well-ordered.
Affairs are virtuous in capability—
using it to handle affairs,
there will be nothing it cannot accomplish.
Movement aligns with timing—
it moves as circumstances dictate,
always finding the proper moment.

These seven lines speak of those with the Dao,
whose words are such,
yet they do not consider themselves capable,
thus in the world
they vie with none,
and none resent or blame them.
This is the meaning of:
*You alone do not vie,*
*thus the world has none to vie with you.*

Those who understand well
often mistake this as the *seven lesser virtues of water*,
thus their interpretations are strained and forced,
not the original intent of **Laozi**.

**Fan Yingyuan** said:
*The highest virtue is like water, approaching the Dao.*
*Approaching* means *near*.
Water, as a thing,
receives the **Heavenly One’s qi**,
has no fixed form yet permeates all,
thus none can nourish as water does—
it is the utmost in benefiting others.
It is square when encountering square,
it is round when encountering round—
what vying is there?

The highest virtue in a person
is subtle, profound, and all-pervading,
constantly benefiting others without contending,
thus virtue is like water.
The multitude prefers high and abhors low,
yet water alone dwells there—
the highest virtue in a person
is always humble and lowly.
With such virtue,
they approach the Dao.

Among the **Sixty-Four Hexagrams of the *Yijing***,
only the **Modesty** hexagram has auspiciousness without misfortune, regret, or stinginess.
**River Master Gong** said:
*The highest virtue in a person is like water’s nature.*
Thus, it is said:
*The highest virtue is like water.*

Water is naturally formless,
thus its principle aligns with the Dao—
omnipresent, benefiting all,
just as water does.
However, once it has taken form,
it diverges from the Dao.
Thus, it is said:
*approaching the Dao.*

Yet it can still be named virtue—
none surpasses it,
thus it is called *highest virtue.*

Dwelling in the highest virtue,
thus without blame.

The virtuous in dwelling choose the good ground—
when they may rest, they rest;
the virtuous in heart are deep—
their mind ever serene and still;
the virtuous in benevolence act justly—
measuring things and distributing fairly;
the virtuous in speech are trustworthy—
their words never false or idle;
the virtuous in governance rule with virtue—
their power is without private gain;
the virtuous in action are skilled—
in all things, they excel;
the virtuous in timing act decisively—
when they may move, they move.

With such virtue and such excellence,
they alone contend not—
thus they have no fault,
and their virtue is complete, their excellence perfect.

Master Xue Yongqi said:
*The highest virtue is like water—
its excellence lies in timely action.*

The noble of highest virtue are clear in nature and pure in virtue,
thus they are like water.

Rain and dew nourish,
springs and streams irrigate—
benefiting all things.
Flowing, they moisten what is low,
stagnant, they gather filth—
dwelling where all others abhor.
Water generates *Heaven One*,
the Dao is without singularity—
thus it is said to approach the Dao.

Dammed, it becomes a nation’s treasure;
released, it becomes a nation’s benefit—
this is the good ground.
Reflected in still waters, its depths are measured—
this is the deep heart.
Nourishing all things, yet claiming no credit—
this is benevolence.
All rivers learn from the sea,
yet they reach the sea—
this is trustworthiness.
Filth is cleansed, high and low are balanced—
this is good governance.
In a square vessel, it is square;
in a round vessel, it is round—
this is skill.
In winter, it congeals;
in spring, it melts—
this is timely action.
For it does not contend,
thus it has no blame.

Under heaven, none are softer or weaker than water—
thus it does not contend.
Since it does not contend,
what blame could there be?

Master Xu Xiuxian said:
*The highest virtue is like water—
thus it has no blame.*

The Dao’s supreme virtue
is called highest excellence.
Water can benefit all things
yet does not vie for merit—
no selfishness.
Water seeks what is low—
this is dwelling where all others abhor.
Water has no mind yet possesses virtue.
Thus it approaches the Dao.
*Approach* means *near*.

Those who embrace the Dao with supreme virtue,
in action and stillness alike,
are like those who dwell in the good ground.
Their measure encompasses all—
this is the deep heart.
They bestow widely and aid the masses,
yet take no pride—
this is benevolence.
Their words are models for others—
this is trustworthiness.
The transformation of virtue and the Dao
spreads like wind through grass—
this is good governance.
Effortless yet wondrous,
achieving without labor—
this is skill.
They speak not against reason,
act not against the Dao—
this is timely action.
Following the Dao in all things,
with no contention between self and other—
thus they have no fault or blame.

Master Zhu Bo-xiu said:
*The highest virtue is like water—
thus it benefits all without contention.*

Excellence upon excellence,
thus it is called highest excellence.
To say *like water* means
that under heaven, no excellence surpasses water.
Moreover, all things arise from yin and moisture—
thus it is said water benefits all things.
Water’s nature follows circumstances,
neither choosing nor rejecting good or ill,
whether in large or small, square or round vessels—
all receive its full measure.
It yields to all taking and giving,
never resisting.
Thus it is said to contend not.

Then too, the nature of the virtuous person
is like water.
Their ability to conform to square or round,
to decline high and embrace low,
to contain rivers and accept all—
not contending with the world—
is like water’s nature,
spread throughout heaven and earth without exclusion.

Dwelling where all others abhor,
thus it approaches the Dao.
For what all others abhor
is to dwell in low places,
and though all things under heaven strive upward,
water’s virtue does not delight in height—
it alone can dwell low.

Confucius often praised water, saying:
*"Water, water—
what can be learned from water?"*
Mencius said:
*"The springs surge ceaselessly,
day and night without pause,
filling each basin before advancing,
flowing unrestrained to the four seas—
such is the way of those with roots."*

This is the virtue of water.
Yet what does *approach the Dao* mean?
*Approach* means *near*.
The Dao is the deep source.
Water’s use in the world
is like the Dao’s presence under heaven—
no thing escapes its nourishment,
no place its moistening.
Thus it is said to approach the Dao.

Though water’s nature is always descending,
human nature is also without fail virtuous.

Mencius said: *"Human nature’s goodness is like water’s tendency to descend. How could it not approach the Dao?"*
**Reside in virtuous places.**
It is said that water’s virtue has seven excellences.
It stands first among the Five Phases and is the sovereign of all grains—
it does not flow unless released,
it does not advance until its basin is full.
If the land grows slightly steep, there is no talk of backflow or reversal;
if the land rises slightly, there is the meaning of unceasing streams.
Only in level, stable places does it rest—
thus it is said to reside in virtuous places.

**The heart is virtuous in depth.**
The heart refers to water’s core.
Like the depths of rivers and seas—
vast and boundless,
stirred yet never turbid,
settled yet ever clearer—
it can contain all rivers,
carrying everything without discrimination,
reflecting forms without bias—
thus it is said the heart is virtuous in depth.

**Generosity is virtuous in kindness.**
Kindness means unceasing life-giving.
Water’s virtue flows ceaselessly, transforming without end,
spreading across the land, bearing forms,
floating beneath the sky, bathing in the sun—
its use is unrestricted, its benefit inexhaustible.
Its virtue matches the Heaven-Earth’s unceasing life-giving mechanism—
thus it is said generosity is virtuous in kindness.

**Speech is virtuous in trustworthiness.**
Its meaning is that water’s virtue is sincere without constraint—
as the ancients praised: *"Great trustworthiness requires no oaths."*
Observe its function:
East Sea departs, West Sea arrives,
cycling endlessly without fail—
like the Tailu’s drainage, flowing from the Milky Way’s heights
to the ocean’s depths,
completing a cycle each year,
never failing in sincerity—
thus it is said speech is virtuous in trustworthiness.

**Governance is virtuous in order.**
Water’s virtue can float the Ten Isles beyond things,
suspend the Six Directions within the cosmos,
alter the mulberry fields into sands,
relocate islands time and again—
accepting both vast and minute,
cleansing impurities without omission,
embodying Heaven’s utmost softness,
conquering Earth’s utmost firmness,
penetrating even the unyielding—
thus it is said governance is virtuous in order.

**Action is virtuous in capability.**
Water’s use is soft yet strong,
weak yet powerful—
nourishing all life,
moistening the Nine Realms,
circulating through Heaven and Earth,
piercing firmness and hardness,
turning land into depths,
boring through cliffs and stone,
leveling heights to lows,
discarding filth while preserving clarity—
Heaven and Earth rely on its transformative function,
creatures and plants benefit from its sustenance—
thus it is said action is virtuous in capability.

**Movement is virtuous in timing.**
Water’s function is ever-flowing, ever-moving.
The ancients said: *"Flowing water does not rot"—
how could it not be virtuous?*
The Classics state: *"Nothing under heaven is softer or weaker than water,
yet nothing surpasses it in overcoming firmness."*
Its operation cannot be altered—
like tidal seas arriving only at their appointed time,
like human reliance on water and fire moving only when needed—
thus it is said movement is virtuous in timing.

**Only the non-contending has no regrets.**
*Only*—a particle of emphasis.
*Regrets*—remorse and grudges.
This speaks of water’s virtue not contending with things,
thus having no remorse or grudges.
Once, Zigong asked: *"Why does a gentleman observe great waters?"*
Confucius replied: *"Great waters resemble virtue, resemble the Dao,
resemble courage yet seem timid,
resemble rectitude yet seem discerning,
resemble resolve yet seem benevolent in transformation."*
Water’s virtue is such—
thus a gentleman must observe it.
From this, how could there be regrets or grudges?
Yang Zhiren said: *"The utmost goodness is like water—thus no regrets."*
It means the Dao-holding sage’s nature is like water:
kind to the people, beneficial to all things,
perturbed yet not defiled, clarified yet not artificially pure,
naturally descending while disdaining elevation—
when poured into a square vessel, it becomes square;
when poured into a round vessel, it becomes round.
Rivers and streams grow long because of this,
the Five Phases stand firm because of this.
*The Book of Transformation* says:
*"Water’s hollows can drown one—
thus it approaches the Dao."*
It nourishes all things, resides in virtuous places.
Deep and luminous, the heart is virtuous in depth.
All things gain life from water—
generosity is virtuous in kindness.
It reflects forms without losing their essence—
speech is virtuous in trustworthiness.
Clear and smooth, governance is virtuous in order.
It can be square or round, curved or straight—
action is virtuous in capability.
It melts in summer and congeals in winter—
movement is virtuous in timing.
Only the non-contending—
its Dao is profound.
Thus there are no regrets.

Mencius said: *"Human nature’s goodness is like water’s tendency to descend.
No one is without goodness, just as water is without fail descending."*
Yu Qingzhong said: *"The utmost goodness is like water—thus no regrets."*
Water is called *"moistening the low"*—
dwelling in the most humble, damp places,
which all people despise.
Water is an emotionless thing—
nothing under heaven is as level as water.
The truly virtuous person resembles it.
The *utmost goodness* refers to those of supreme virtue and perfection.
According to old teachings, water embodies three near-Dao abilities and seven virtues beneficial to things.
What are the three abilities?
Water’s nature is tranquil and disperses to nourish all—
Heaven without water would be parched,
Earth without water would wither—
benefiting all things—
this is the first ability.
Nothing under heaven is softer or weaker than water—
it abandons solidity for emptiness,
rejects height for lowliness—
blocked, it stops;
released, it flows;
submitting to human command—
this is the second ability.
Though people dislike dwelling in low places,
water seeks the low and damp,
making things pure while receiving filth—
this is the third ability.
*Near*—meaning *close*.
Heaven generates water—*one*—the Dao.
The Dao’s *one* is the non-dual *one*,
water’s *one* is the dual *one*.
The non-dual *one* is the Dao’s essence,
the dual *one* is the Dao’s function—
thus it is said to approach the Dao.

What are the seven virtues?
The sage’s dwelling is virtuous in humility,
following things naturally,
transforming even the neighborhood—
like water on the earth,
virtuous in descending to low places,
nourishing all things.

「Hence it is said: *Dwelling is virtuous in the land*.
This is the first virtue.

The sage’s heart is clear and deep,
penetrating to the most subtle depths,
tranquil and unobstructed—
like a watery abyss, undisturbed,
never losing its clarity and stillness—
hence it is said: *The heart is virtuous in its depth*.
This is the second virtue.

The sage’s giving is benevolent and kind,
extending to all without distinction of near or far—
like the grease of water, nourishing,
permeating all things universally,
without limit or restraint.
Hence it is said: *Giving is virtuous in its kindness*.
This is the third virtue.

The sage’s words are sincere and steadfast,
unalterable, harmonizing with all things—
like the tides responding to celestial cues,
swelling and receding day and night,
never missing their appointed moments.
Hence it is said: *Speech is virtuous in its trustworthiness*.
This is the fourth virtue.

The sage governs with equanimity,
treating all with a balanced heart,
naturally yielding to order—
nothing remains ungoverned,
like clear water, virtuous in stabilizing high and low,
distinguishing beauty and ugliness on its own,
with no thing escaping its form.
Hence it is said: *Governance is virtuous in its efficacy*.
This is the fifth virtue.

The sage confronts affairs,
virtuous in its ability to adapt to things,
assigning roles according to capacity,
each fitting their measure—
like water’s yielding nature,
accommodating to square or round,
long or short,
adapting to every vessel,
with no application beyond its reach.
Hence it is said: *Affairs are virtued in their ability*.
This is the sixth virtue.

The sage’s movement and stillness,
align with the world’s shifts,
emerging and retiring as circumstances demand,
never stagnating in things—
like water’s motion,
changing with the seasons,
congealing in winter and flowing in summer,
never deviating from its course.
Hence it is said: *Movement is virtuous in its timing*.
This is the seventh virtue.

All things that are not level,
find their resolution in water and cease their striving—
how then could there be blame?
To observe water is an art,
and it may be said to be masterful in its form and function.

Confucius observed the flowing waters of the east,
and Zigong asked: *"Why does the gentleman always observe great waters?"*
Confucius replied: *"Because it never rests—
water seems to embody **virtue** (德).
Its flow is low and humble,
and when it carves through cities,
it must first smooth its path—
this seems like **righteousness** (義).
Its vastness knows no end,
this seems like the **Dao/Way** (道).
It rushes to depths a hundred fathoms high without fear,
this seems like **courage** (勇).
When measured, it is always level—
this seems like its **fullness** (盛).
Yet it does not seek to irrigate—
this seems like **rectitude** (正).
Its subtle currents reach everywhere—
this seems like **perception** (察).
Its source always flows east—
this seems like **purpose** (志).
It emerges and withdraws,
and all things conform and transform—
this seems like **virtuous transformation** (善化).
Thus, water’s virtues are such—
the gentleman must observe them.
The ancients indeed took inspiration from water,
and there was good reason for it.

Xú Liúxū said: *"The highest virtue is like water—
thus it approaches the Dao.
The one who embodies the Dao is called the highest virtue.
The highest virtue is beyond compare—
only water can illustrate it.
Hence it is said: **The highest virtue is like water** (上善若水).

Water’s virtue is beyond improvement:
it benefits all things without striving,
nourishes with its dampness and seeks low places,
dwelling where people abhor.
All filth and evil,
it receives and purifies—
thus it approaches the Dao.

The Dao is but a hair’s breadth away.
**Dwelling is virtuous in the land**—
resting in the **Kàn** (坎), descending to low places.
**The heart is virtuous in its depth**—
tranquil and clear, reflecting all things.
**Giving is virtuous in its kindness**—
benefiting and nourishing all things.
**Speech is virtuous in its trustworthiness**—
tides and currents come on time.
**Governance is virtuous in its efficacy**—
level, it makes no sound.
**Affairs are virtued in their ability**—
irrigating with purpose.
**Movement is virtuous in its timing**—
spring rises, autumn ebbs.
Since it does not strive,
there is no blame.
It takes virtue as its essence,
and non-striving as its function—
thus in every use, there is no fault.

Sū Jìng said: *"The highest virtue is like water—
thus it is without blame.
This passage of Laozi’s intent
lies solely in **non-striving** (不争).
The highest virtue is the foremost and most excellent principle in the world.
Compare it to nothing like water:
all things rely on water to flourish—
this is its virtue in benefiting.
Yet water never claims to be of benefit—
people abhor dwelling in low places,
but water flows where it is damp,
dwelling where people abhor,
yet never complains.
If one can embody water’s virtue—
to benefit the world with nourishment—
and yet lack the desire to seek high or distant things,
then they are the highest virtue,
and also approach the Dao.

How does the one who embodies the Dao
compare to water in virtue?
Their dwelling must always be in low places—
like water benefiting things.
Their heart must always be deep and still—
like water’s tranquil repose.
Their giving must always be expansive and beneficent—
like water irrigating the withered.
Their trust must always be in truth—
like water’s surge and ebb, which must make sound.
Their governance must always be orderly—
like water flowing smoothly downward.
Their handling of affairs must always suit their abilities—
like water’s swift and rapid currents."*

The virtuous in action must discern the times well—
like water swelling in summer and receding in autumn.

These seven virtues are all like water’s goodness,
yet they do not yet reach water’s highest virtue.
Water’s supreme virtue lies in not contending for gain?
For only by not contending does one avoid blame.

This is how Yu was without arrogance—
none in the world dared contend with his virtue.
Yu was without self-praise—
none in the world dared contend with his deeds.
What is this if not the world’s highest virtue?

The teachings of Laozi are most profound in "not contending":
"Hold not the worthy in high esteem, so the people do not contend."
"Only by not contending can one be uncontested in the world."
"This is called the virtue of not contending."
"The Dao of Heaven is uncontested yet triumphs."
"The Sage’s Way acts without contending."
These six all speak of the virtue of not contending without blame.

The utterance of the heart cannot be concealed.
All insults and humiliations, though shameful,
can be endured and borne—
this is the ability to act and yet not act.
One’s talents and strength may suffice to surpass the world,
yet they are concealed and unused.
Their actions never seek to lead the world,
how then could there be contention?
Thus, they are truly the highest virtue.

Master Ben-yuan of the Upper Hut said:
"The highest virtue is like water—
so perfect that there is no blame.
Without virtue to name, it is perfect.
With virtue to name, yet acting as water does naturally—
this is the virtue beyond virtue.

To benefit all things is to have merit,
and having merit invites contention.
To have merit yet not contend is difficult.
Yet to dwell where others abhor, without complaint—
is this not even more difficult?

The one approaching the Dao
is second only to the nameless Dao itself.

Residence, heart, giving, speech, governance, affairs, and action—
these are human matters.
The good at choosing dwelling are like water’s high and low,
following the land.
The good at depth are like water’s stillness and profundity,
unshaken.
The good at benevolence are like water’s boundless nourishment.
The good at trust are like water’s unerring course,
neither deceiving nor delayed.
The good at governance are like water’s cleansing flow,
unobstructed.
The good at ability are like water’s adaptability—
to vessels, square or round, straight or curved.
The good at timing are like water’s ebb and flow,
spring’s fullness and autumn’s retreat,
never missing its measure.

All these follow their natural course,
competing with nothing—
thus, they never incur the slightest blame.

Stone Pool says:
"The highest virtue is like water.
Water benefits all things yet does not contend,
dwelling where others abhor—
thus, it approaches the Dao.

Residence is good at choosing dwelling,
the heart is good at depth,
giving is good at benevolence,
speech is good at trust,
governance is good at order,
affairs are good at ability,
action is good at timing.

Only by not contending does one avoid blame.
The highest virtue is like water—
using water’s virtues to illustrate human virtue.

Water benefits all things,
and all things thrive where water flows.
The uncontested—
though water benefits all things,
it never competes with them.
Dwelling where others abhor—
water’s nature is to nourish the low,
yet people despise the low.
Only by not contending and dwelling in the place others abhor
does one approach the Dao.

If one’s dwelling is good like water’s nourishment,
the heart is deep like water’s stillness,
giving is benevolent like water’s boundless flow,
speech is trustworthy like the tides’ punctuality,
governance is orderly like water’s reflection of all things—
high and low, fair and foul—
without omitting a form,
affairs are handled with ability like water’s adaptability—
to square or round, straight or curved—
actions are timed like water’s spring swelling and autumn’s retreat,
never missing its rhythm—
all these follow their natural course,
competing with nothing—
thus, they never incur the slightest blame.

From *Residence in Good Dwelling* onward,
this chapter speaks of human highest virtue resembling water.
If one seeks only in water, then speech and governance are not addressed.

The earlier text says:
"Water benefits all things yet does not contend—
thus, it approaches the Dao."
This speaks of water’s virtue.
*Residence in Good Dwelling* and the seven virtues
speak of human virtue resembling water’s virtue.
Its essence lies in not contending.

*The Collected Commentaries on the Dao De Jing, Volume Thirteen*
Compiled by Master Jingyuan of the Remote and Far,
Supervisor of Observances at Xuanmiao Guan,
Edited by Liu Weiyong,
Corrected by Ding Yidong,
Formerly a Palace Attendant and Compiler at the Gunucimi Yuan,
Also a Clerk at the Taifu Temple.

「Comparative Analysis: Master He Shang composed *The Chapter of the Wandering Yi* (《运夷章》), while Zhao Shixian wrote *The Chapter of Observing Retreat as Advancement* (《观退为进义章》).

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang explained: The previous chapter elucidates the virtuous conduct of the sage—gentle and yielding, hence free from blame. This chapter clarifies how the common folk, drowned in desires and arrogant with excess, inevitably incur fault.

It begins with the admonition **"Hold and it will overflow; grasp and it will blunt"** (持而盈之, 不如其已。 揣而锐之, 不可长保), showing how such states are hard to preserve. Next, it warns of gold and jade, wealth and honor, cautioning against greed. It concludes with **"When achievements are complete and name is fulfilled, withdraw"** (功成名遂身退), urging one to forget merit and avoid harm.

Master Du Guangting remarked: The previous chapter used water as an analogy to illustrate the Way of cultivation. Here, with **"Hold and it will overflow"**** as its opening, it further reveals the folly of greed and stagnation, urging one to forget merit and retreat, thus aligning with the sage’s perfection.

Zhang Chongying stated: *Yi* refers to the boundless void of the cosmos—clear and luminous yet without form or color—unfathomable by humans. Though human affairs may flow like that void, if one prevents others from perceiving them, it is akin to concealing one’s spirit and avoiding self-harm.

**"Hold and it will overflow; grasp and it will blunt"** (持而盈之, 不如其已。 揣而锐之, 不可长保).
**"Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can keep them"** (金玉满堂, 莫之能守).
**"Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting self-blame"** (富贵而骄, 自遗其咎).
**"When achievements are complete and name is fulfilled, withdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven"** (功成名遂身退, 天之道).

Comparative Analysis: Yan Zun, Yang Fu, and Wang Bi all concurred with the ancient text.

Master He Shang said: **"Hold and it will overflow; grasp and it will blunt"** (持而盈之, 不如其已).
*Sweng*, meaning "full," *ji*, meaning "stop."
To hold what is full is to risk collapse—better to stop.

**"Grasp and it will blunt"** (揣而锐之, 不可长保).
*Chuai*, meaning "to refine."
After refinement, it must be discarded—its sharpness cannot endure.

**"Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can keep them"** (金玉满堂, 莫之能守).
Lustful desires harm the spirit, riches burden the body.

**"Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting self-blame"** (富贵而骄, 自遗其咎).
If one is wealthy, they should relieve the poor; if noble, they should pity the lowly. Yet if they instead grow arrogant, calamity will surely befall them.

**"When achievements are complete and name is fulfilled, withdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven"** (功成名遂身退, 天之道).
It means that when a person’s deeds are accomplished and their reputation secured, if they do not retreat and relinquish their prominence, they will meet misfortune. This is Heaven’s constant Way.

As the sun reaches its zenith and begins to decline, the moon wanes after fullness, things flourish only to decay, and joy reaches its peak before sorrow follows.

Wang Fu’s commentary: **"Hold and it will overflow; grasp and it will blunt"** (持而盈之, 不如其已).
*Chi* means "to hold without losing virtue," but if one holds virtue while also filling oneself with excess, collapse is inevitable. Thus, it is better to stop—meaning to be even worse than having no virtue or merit at all.

**"Grasp and it will blunt"** (揣而锐之, 不可长保).
If one refines and sharpens it further after already making it sharp, its force will only be exhausted and ruined—thus it cannot be long preserved.

**"Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can keep them"** (金玉满堂, 莫之能守).
It is better to stop.

**"Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting self-blame"** (富贵而骄, 自遗其咎).
It cannot be long preserved.

**"When achievements are complete and name is fulfilled, withdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven"** (功成名遂身退, 天之道).
The seasons cycle in turn, and when merit is fulfilled, one must withdraw.

Emperor Xuanzong remarked: **"Hold and it will overflow; grasp and it will blunt"** (持而盈之, 不如其已).
To grasp and fill with excess, lest it topple—if one accumulates, it becomes a burden, and regret will arise. Hence, it is better to stop.
*Ji*, meaning "to stop."

Explanation: *Chi* means "to grasp," *sweng* means "full," *ji* means "to stop."
It speaks of how human hearts, greedy and insatiable, grasp and hoard, filling themselves with wealth. Accumulation brings burdens, and regret will inevitably follow. Thus, the sage warns: It is better to cease.

**"Grasp and it will blunt"** (揣而锐之, 不可长保).
*Chuai* means "to measure or refine," *rui* means "sharp and keen."
To refine and sharpen desires for fame and honor, to cling to power and rely on wealth—if one accumulates to fullness, arrogance will arise, and ruin will follow. Thus, it cannot be long preserved.

Explanation: *Chuai* means "to measure or assess," *rui* means "sharp and keen."
All who are mired in desires, greedy for fame and gain, assess past deeds and sharpen their ambition, provoking resentment and inviting ruin. Hence, it cannot be long preserved.

**"Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can keep them"** (金玉满堂, 莫之能守).
This illustrates how excess is difficult to sustain.

Explanation: Suppose one’s greed knows no bounds, filling their halls with gold and jade. Even elephants are tamed by fire, and roosters mutilated for ritual propriety. Yet, by losing the treasure of non-greed, one invites the anxiety of bandits. With such harm, how can they be guarded? This reverses the meaning of **"Hold and it will overflow."**

**"Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting self-blame"** (富贵而骄, 自遗其咎).
This reveals how sharpness cannot be grasped—arrogance stems from the heart, so blame is not from another.

Explanation: Wealth attracts envy, so one easily oppresses others. Honor demands deference, so one readily domineers over others. Arrogance and excess arise without warning; calamity follows without cause. Regret comes from arrogance itself, born of the heart. Hence, it is said: one invites blame upon themselves. This reverses the meaning of **"Grasp and it will blunt."**

**"When achievements are complete and name is fulfilled, withdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven"** (功成名遂身退, 天之道).
Those whose achievements are complete and reputation secured should retreat and avoid excess—just as Heaven’s Way follows the cycles of fullness and emptiness. Thus, there will be no misfortune.

Explanation: This is an admonition. Fullness invites loss, while humility brings benefit. Even Heaven does not remain perpetually full, so those who achieve will be humbled, and those who gain fame will suffer decline. To seek long preservation is unheard of. One must instead forget merit and fame, retreat, and relinquish excess—like Heaven’s Way. Only by not defying the cycles of fullness and emptiness can one avoid calamity and censure.

Master Du Guangting said: The analogy of **"Hold and it will overflow"**** encompasses four meanings.
One: Clinging to desires until they reach fullness.
Two: Hoarding worldly wealth until it overflows.
Three: Persisting in evil deeds until they swell.
Four: Grasping authority and relying on office until they become excessive.

In general, those who know only advancement and forget retreat, who do not reflect on the Dao of virtue, who cling stubbornly without turning back—all such as reach fullness will meet retribution. Those whose desires overflow will suffer from feebleness and illness, harming their lives. Those whose worldly wealth overflows will face plunder and loss.

The evil deeds that reach fullness will meet retribution through punishment, calamity, and harm.
Those whose power and emoluments overflow will face ruin and annihilation.
Thus, the Venerable Lord Lao admonishes: *"It is better to cease than to persist in holding fullness.*
If one neither ceases nor stops, retribution will surely manifest.
To sharpen and press forward is not something that can be long preserved.

When a ruler sharpens his ambition to expand territory and seize land, the people will resent it and the state will perish.
When a minister sharpens his greed for profit and fame, his own life will be endangered and disaster will follow.
Even if he temporarily gains what he desires, how can it last?
Moreover, advancement brings no benefit, while retreat brings only worry and misfortune.
Hence, it is said: *"It cannot be long preserved.*

Gold and jade filling the halls cannot be guarded forever.
Even if one could measure and discern, and sharply curb avarice, filling the halls with treasures and ornaments—
there will still be plunder and attack, how could one preserve and guard them?
Much less can one, with a limited lifespan and insatiable desires, hope to preserve gold and jade when death cannot be averted.

There is the parable of the elephant burning itself with its own tusks:
In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Shànggōng Year 24, when the Jin minister Fán Xuānzǐ governed, the burdens on the allied states grew heavy, and the people of Zheng lamented.
In the second month, the Duke of Zheng visited Jin.
Zǐchǎn entrusted a letter to Zǐxī to convey to Xuānzǐ:
*"You govern Jin, yet the neighboring states hear only of heavy burdens, not of virtuous governance. I am perplexed by this.
I have heard that those who govern states must fear not the lack of wealth, but the difficulty of earning a virtuous name.
When wealth accumulates in the lord’s halls, the states grow disloyal.
If you rely on it, Jin will become disloyal.
When the states are disloyal, Jin will collapse; when Jin collapses, your house will fall.
Why would you court such ruin?
Wealth is but a vehicle for virtue, and virtue is the foundation of a state.
With a foundation, there is no collapse—why not strive for this?
Virtue brings joy, and joy ensures longevity. The *Odes* say:
‘Joy belongs to the virtuous; it is the foundation of the state.’
Thus, it is the virtuous name that matters.
Reflect deeply to cultivate virtue, let your virtuous name spread far and near, and all will be at peace.
Would you rather have people say, ‘You gave life to us,’ or ‘You drained us to death?’
The elephant burns itself with its own tusks—wealth is like that.
Xuānzǐ was pleased and lightened the burdens.
This was the reason the Duke of Zheng visited Jin—because of the heavy burdens.

The rooster that cuts off its own tail:
In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*’ transmission of Zǐzhāo, son of King Jìng of Zhou, Mèng Shì went to the suburbs and saw a rooster cut off its own tail, sighing:
‘The use of sacrificial animals depends on their completeness and fatness.
Now it cuts off its own tail, making itself incomplete, hoping to avoid being used as a sacrifice.
Thus does the rooster preserve its life—how much more so for humans?
To covet gain and forget oneself is even worse than the rooster’s folly.

The treasure of non-covetousness:
A man of Zheng found a jade piece and offered it to Zǐhǎn, saying:
‘This is a treasure. I would present it to you.’
Zǐhǎn replied:
‘You consider jade a treasure, but I consider non-covetousness a treasure.
If I take the jade, we both lose our treasures.
It is better to preserve both.’
Thus, he did not accept the jade.

The thief who invites plunder:
The *Yì* explains the third line of the *Guà* hexagram:
‘*Bearing and mounting, bringing thieves upon oneself.*’
Bearing refers to the petty man’s burden—carrying burdens for others.
Mounting refers to the noble’s carriage.
Now the petty man abandons his burden and takes the noble’s carriage—
this is the petty man riding in the noble’s instrument.
Thus, thieves will think to seize it.
Arrogance in wealth and rank invites one’s own downfall.
Abundance is called wealth, so people seek it.
High position is called rank, so people submit to it.
If one is full without overflowing, this is how one long preserves wealth.
If one is high without peril, this is how one long preserves rank.
The saying goes: *"Wealth and rank do not last for the arrogant and extravagant—
arrogance and extravagance bring their own ruin.
If one does not guard against them, contempt and insults will follow,
and disaster will surely come.
‘Hereditary’ means ‘given by oneself.’
Blame does not come from outside—it arises from one’s own arrogance and negligence.
Hence, it is said: *"Arrogance comes from the heart.
If one can be high in rank without peril, wealthy without overflowing,
free from grievances, and disaster-free,
then governing the state and cultivating oneself is perfect.

Arrogance is pride.
When achievement is complete and fame is fulfilled, one should retreat—this is the Way of Heaven.
To avert disaster and eliminate misfortune is called *achievement*,
wealth, rank, honor, and glory are called *fame*.
If achievement is complete and fame is fulfilled, yet one does not know when to retreat,
few escape calamity.
Why is this?
Favor invites disgrace, fullness invites decline, and extremism invites regret.
When fine birds are exhausted, the good bow is hidden;
when the hare is killed, the hunting dogs are boiled—
this is the inevitable course of things.
Fàn Lì escaped disaster in a small boat, while Dàfū Zhōu lost his life clinging to his position—
this is the lesson.

The sun reaches its zenith and then declines,
the moon is full and then wanes,
heat gives way to cold,
spring’s flourishing turns to autumn’s fall—
this is the Way of Heaven.
If one aligns with the cycles of fullness and emptiness in Heaven’s Way,
forgets the pursuit of achievement and fame,
and like Zǐfáng abstains from food to wander freely,
or like Cú Guāng resigns his seal to live in refinement,
then there will be no regret like that of Cāi Huàtíng or Huàtíng’s pursuit.
How much more so for one who holds the *jiǔwǔ* position and governs the myriad people,
illuminating the four quarters and regulating the seas,
yet does not heed the warning against holding fullness to excess?

The Lord of Song’s Way says:
*Holding fullness to excess cannot be long preserved.
Fullness leads to overflow, sharpness leads to blunting.
The principle of all things is that fullness must have its deficiency.
If one does not know to hold emptiness in readiness for fullness,
or to grasp emptiness to govern fullness,
and instead indulges in the desires of overflow and sharpness,
one only increases the calamity of ruin.
The changes of things are boundless, but human wisdom is limited.
Preemptive knowledge is the flower of the Way, the beginning of folly.
If one measures things by their nature yet sharpens his pursuit of immediate gain,
his wisdom will falter at times—
how can such a state be long preserved?*

The Lord of Song’s Way says:
*"Gold and jade filling the halls—this is how one invites his own calamity.
Wealth and noble rank are not the Dao of life and nature.
External things cannot be relied upon as one’s own.
Treasure gold and jade, and you are burdened by things;
burdened by things, how can you avoid loss?
None can guard them.
Rich and noble yet proud, you harm your virtue.
He who harms his virtue—how can he escape misfortune?
Thus it is said: *‘He invites his own calamity.’*

The Sage does not cling to the gains of a single age as his private possession,
nor does he take ruling the world as his own display of honor.
What need has he for gold and jade as treasures,
or for wealth and rank as burdens?
Thus, when wealth is supreme, the state’s resources are exhausted alongside it;
when rank is supreme, the state’s honors are depleted alongside it.
His nobility is unmatched, his wealth unparalleled,
yet the Way remains unshaken.
When achievement is complete and name is fulfilled, he withdraws—
this is the Way of Heaven.
When achievement is complete, it collapses;
when name is fulfilled, it falters.
At high noon, the sun declines;
when the moon is full, it wanes—
this is the nature of things.
The Sage perceives the signs of rise and decay,
discerns the inevitable cycles of fullness and deficiency,
and stands apart, unburdened, free from the calamity of pride and excess.
Who but one who knows Heaven could attain this?
Thus it is said: *‘When achievement is complete and name is fulfilled, he withdraws—
this is the Way of Heaven.’*

The revolutions of the four seasons—
when achievement is complete, it departs—
this is the Way of Heaven.
To know advancement but not retreat,
to know preservation but not ruin,
to know gain but not loss—
how can one avoid regret?

Yi Yin said:
*The minister does not dwell on success through favor and gain.*
Wang Anshi said:
*Holding fullness to excess cannot be long preserved.*

He who clings to his vessel’s fullness
will easily overturn it.
He who sharpens his grasp
cannot long preserve it.
He who sharpens his grasp
cannot long preserve it.
Gold and jade filling the halls—
none can guard them.
The halls are empty receptacles for things.
When gold and jade fill them, they are full—
thus they cannot be guarded.
Rich and noble yet proud—
he invites his own calamity.
Great wealth and rank do not seek pride,
yet pride arrives naturally—
this is how calamity is invited.

When achievement is complete and name is fulfilled, he withdraws—
this is the Way of Heaven.
For the Sage, when achievement is complete and name is fulfilled,
he withdraws—
this is the Way of Heaven.

The Way of Heaven:
The high are humbled, the low are raised.
It is also said: *‘Heaven diminishes fullness and benefits the modest.’*
The *Book of Documents* says: *‘The modest receive benefit; the proud invite loss.’*

Su Yingbin said:
*Holding fullness to excess cannot be long preserved.
Knowing fullness must overflow yet clinging to it—
it is better not to fill at all.
Knowing sharpness must blunt yet sharpening it—
it is better not to sharpen at all.
As for the Sage, possessing yet not possessing,
how could there be fullness?
Following principle before acting,
how could there be sharpness?
Without fullness, there is no need to cling;
without excess, there is no need to guard.
Without excess, there is no need to sharpen.

Gold and jade filling the halls—
this is the Way of Heaven when he withdraws.
The sun at its zenith declines,
the moon at its full wanes.
The revolutions of the four seasons—
when achievement is complete, it departs.
Even Heaven and Earth follow this—
how much more so for humans?

Lu Jifu said:
*Holding fullness to excess cannot be long preserved.
Clinging to prevent overflow yet filling—
this only invites greater overflow.
If one wishes to avoid overflow,
it is better not to fill at all.
Sharpening to prevent loss yet sharpening—
this cannot be long preserved.
Sharpening to anticipate loss—
this only invites greater loss.
If one wishes to avoid loss,
it is better not to sharpen at all.

Gold and jade filling the halls—
none can guard them.
To remain full without overflowing—
this is how wealth is long preserved.
Holding fullness to excess—
then gold and jade fill the halls,
and none can guard them.
Rich and noble yet proud—
he invites his own calamity.
To be high yet not perilous—
this is how nobility is long preserved.
Sharpening to excess—
then wealth and rank bring pride,
and he invites his own calamity.

When achievement is complete and name is fulfilled, he withdraws—
this is the Way of Heaven.
Then how does one avoid this calamity?
Only by conforming to the Way of Heaven.
For when achievement is complete and name is fulfilled, he withdraws—
this is the Way of Heaven,
the means by which the private is accomplished without selfishness.
The *Book of Documents* says: *‘The Sage withdrew himself.’*
This is to follow the Way of Heaven.

Wang Yuanzai said:
*Holding fullness to excess cannot be long preserved.
Clinging to fullness with intent—
this is how one loses it.
Only by forgetting the act of possessing as possession itself,
and holding through non-possession,
can one avoid loss and overflow.
Sharpening to excess cannot be long preserved.
The cunning measure emotions,
the sharp exploit things,
yet affairs are boundless,
and one holds a single life to meet their changes—
then the skill of clinging and sharpening will falter at times.
How can it be long preserved?
Thus the Sage follows the times, rides the principle,
and meets them with non-self—
his actions are boundless,
his responses inexhaustible.

Gold and jade filling the halls—
none can guard them.
Treasuring external things and guarding them—
what is guarded is not truly possessed.
How could it be guarded?
Rich and noble yet proud—
he invites his own calamity.
Pride arises from reliance on externals—
what use are those who rely on externals?
The four [wealth, rank, clinging, sharpening]—
all stem from having things—
what difference is there between them and pride?
Yet clinging to fullness only leads downward,
each loss growing worse.

When achievement is complete and name is fulfilled, he withdraws—
this is the Way of Heaven.
Cold and heat succeed one another,
things at their extreme reverse,
yin and yang alternate—
the Way of Heaven is thus.
Yet the foolish of the world,
once encountering change,
once transgressing its name,
cling to it for life,
taking it as their own,
unaware of the subtle shifts of creation,
the hidden patterns of fortune and misfortune—
thus they inevitably invite calamity,
unable to preserve themselves.

The Sage is not thus.
He hides gold and jade yet does not treasure them,
dwells in wealth and rank yet does not glory in them.
All things that come as guests
are like shadows gathering at his feet—
vague, unknown whether they belong to him or to another.
Then how could he cling to fullness as a burden,
or sharpen his grasp as a skill?"

「If not for the peerless marvel of selflessness,
how could he partake in this?

The Dao of Heaven is vast indeed,
yet nothing surpasses this principle.

Liu Jujie said:
*"To grasp and fill is not as good as to let go."*
He meant that one who clings to fullness,
seeking wealth and riches,
is a fool.

When full yet able to remain empty,
what need is there for such exertion?

To grasp what cannot be held—
to grasp is to invite ruin.
Thus it is said: *"Not as good as to let go."*
To let go is to cease.

To probe and sharpen is not long-lasting.
He meant that to measure and intrude,
seeking absolute certainty,
is a delusion.

When sharp yet able to remain blunt,
what need is there for such craft?

If the measure fails,
then the measure itself is flawed.
It cannot be long preserved,
not because it can be luckily preserved,
but because having obtained it,
one is bound to lose it.

Gold and jade fill the halls,
yet none can keep them.
This further illustrates the meaning of *"Not as good as to let go."*
The halls and chambers,
though vast enough to store gold and jade,
are doomed by their fullness—
unless it be Heaven’s retribution,
then there will surely be human calamity.

Wealth and honor yet pride,
one invites his own misfortune.
This further explains *"It cannot be long preserved."*
Wealth and honor breed arrogance,
arrogance breeds transgression,
and by taking pride against others,
one seals his own fate with reputation.

When the work is done and the name is earned,
he withdraws—
this is the Dao of Heaven.
To benefit others is the work,
to be praised and then renounce the self is the name.
Work is the substance of wealth and honor,
while fame and praise are its superficial adornments.

Work must be completed,
name must be fulfilled—
wealth and honor, fame and power,
are inevitable even for the Sage and the Worthies.
Yet they do not topple and fall.
If they are full,
it is not because they seized the moment,
if they benefit others,
it is not because they schemed to gain it—
yet they can empty themselves and guard against pride,
withdrawing in due time.

For those who stand on the foundation of completed work and earned name,
while common folk advance,
the Sage and Worthies retreat—
could one who does not embody the Dao of Heaven
achieve such mastery?

The sun and moon alternate in their brightness,
the four seasons follow in succession—
this is the Dao of Heaven.

The previous chapter spoke of the highest virtue,
like water, allowing one to dwell in wealth and honor.
Thus this passage follows.

Liu Ji said:
*"To grasp and fill, until withdrawing—
this is the Dao of Heaven.
The Great Dao is clear and bright,
yet the people love shortcuts.
Because of their thick attachment to life,
they are bewildered by the realm of action,
seeking swift success,
unaware of the wondrous workings of Nature.
They cling and grasp to achieve fullness,
yet fullness only leads to loss—
thus it is not as good as to let go.
To probe and sharpen to attain sharpness,
yet sharpness only leads to blunting—
thus gold and jade cannot be long preserved,
as they are burdens of things.
Things become burdens,
and those who desire them multiply—
thus none can keep them.
Wealth and honor yet pride,
harm one’s virtue.
Harming virtue,
those who attack multiply—
thus one invites his own misfortune.

The Sage dwells at the peak of wealth and honor,
yet without the burden of fullness,
for his work is done and his name is earned,
and he withdraws in time.
Would he cling to fullness
or probe for sharpness?

The sun and moon alternate in their brightness,
the four seasons follow in succession—
those who complete their work withdraw,
this is the Dao of Heaven.

The Sage follows the Dao of Heaven,
thus it is hard to advance yet easy to retreat,
abandoning the ways of others
and seeking within himself—
hence the next passage speaks of nurturing the spirit and body."*

Zhao Shixian said:
*"The first four lines speak of not dwelling:
First, not the Dao of utmost emptiness.
*'To grasp and fill is not as good as to let go.'*
One’s body is not hard to govern,
the Great Dao is not hard to exhaust.
What is not difficult lies in recognizing the heart.

The heart is originally nonexistent.
At first, it arises from love,
where the four great elements gather,
and the five aggregates converge.
Blood and qi rely upon each other,
a hundred limbs interdependently form—
all these arise from deluded thoughts.

Now that the heart is recognized,
the hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera
exist within it—
to whom else shall I be close?
To grasp yet possess—
all are delusions.

By the heart clinging to delusion,
bewilderment arises.
By the heart recognizing emptiness,
delusion is self-destroyed.

The Sage knows this,
thus he says: *"I have a body,
yet the body is delusion.
If external things come,
I forget external things.
The body and external things—
both forgotten in truth,
within the forgetfulness,
Heaven’s light shines forth.
I do not know if things forget me,
or if I forget things—
in the empty chamber, whiteness is born,
the Dao comes naturally.
Where is the so-called ‘grasping fullness’?

To grasp fullness is to have things,
having things distances one from the Dao.
The text says: *‘To grasp and fill,’*
meaning the vessel is full.
To grasp is to use one’s hands—
taking what is nonexistent to fill emptiness,
reluctant to pour it out,
unwilling to forget it.
In his actions,
he cannot even lift his feet without stirring dust,
in his sitting,
he dares not turn his gaze.
He exhausts his spirit and torments his heart,
all for one vessel.
Before things are harmed,
his body is already frazzled and weary.
Deluded calculations and stubborn attachments—
such is his plight,
for he does not view it from the perspective of the body.
The body is originally no body—
where then do things reside?
I forget myself,
what concern are things to me?
The closest things are known,
the distant ones can be understood.

To let go is to attain liberation.
Second, self-inflicted injury from sharpness.
*'To probe and sharpen is not long-lasting.'*
By nature, one desires stillness,
yet without stillness, fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse arise.
By nature, one’s qi seeks balance,
yet without balance, resentment and anger, love and desire arise.

The heart that opposes things must seek victory,
yet without movement, it gains nothing.
Desiring gain,
the stillness stirs and becomes contention.
What is not beneficial does not enter,
desiring benefit,
the balanced becomes sharp and leads to injury.

To harm integrity yet gain—
how could one preserve it?

For one who knows stillness,
contention ceases,
and without contention,
harm with things does not arise.
Harmony and peace bring self-serenity,
self-serenity guards the spirit—
not burdening the form with gain,
not injuring the body with nourishment,
aligning with the great and turning away from the great orifices,
thus attaining the midst of indifference—
this is the ancient virtue of preserving life.
How could one covet small gains,
be like a greedy wolf,
seeing benefit yet forgetting the self,
seeking power yet exhausting it,
and invite the Dao of peril and annihilation?"」

「Those who do not understand this are like that of **Zhao Tuo** [晁错], who was ordered to reduce the lands of the feudal lords—his state was not yet prosperous when he met his death; or **Deng Ai** [邓艾], who led the campaign against Eastern Wu—his plans were not yet fulfilled when he died prematurely. All were harmed by their sharpness—how could one not take heed?

**Three: What is not innate cannot be firmly held.**
Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them.
Those skilled in seeking the Dao seek within themselves; those skilled in preserving virtue secure what they attain.
Without seeking the Dao, there is no foundation for virtue; without establishing virtue, there is no way to manifest the Dao.
If one is unsettled here, if one is hasty here, then external things cannot be allowed to enter.
Once virtue and the Dao are lost, what one preserves lies outside—grand halls with carved beams and ornate walls, towering eaves and sculpted partitions—unless filled with gold and jade, they cannot be said to be truly refined.
Gold and jade are the essence of pure yang, treasured by the world.
Those who gain these and consider themselves rich do not follow a lasting path.
They can only moisten their homes but not nourish their bodies; they can invite thieves but cannot ensure blessings. Thus, greed for gain becomes a fatal malady, and the pursuit of wealth leads to reckless excess.
What need is there for such transient fortune?

**Four: The virtuous person guards against arrogance.**
Rich and noble yet proud, one invites disaster upon oneself.
The *Hong Fan* [《洪范》] lists five blessings: first, longevity; second, wealth—but it never mentions nobility.
For wealth can bring nobility, yet nobility does not necessarily bring wealth.
Zhuangzi said: *"Great wealth brings the nation’s treasures; great nobility brings the nation’s honors."*
If one can attain wealth, nobility will follow.
Yet even a son of a thousand pieces of gold sits without arrogance—though one may wish not to be proud, how can it be avoided?
Power compels it thus.
But if one, in wealth and nobility, precedes it with propriety, applies it with benevolence, and acts with righteousness, then even wealth and nobility cannot burden virtue.
There are those of noble character who surpass this—arrogance harms virtue.
Those who harm virtue, can they escape misfortune?
Zigong asked: *"Poor yet without flattery, rich yet without arrogance—how is that?"*
The Master replied: *"That is acceptable.
But it is not as good as being poor yet joyful, or rich yet fond of ritual."*

Those like the **Fan family**, who suffered humiliation at the hands of **Qiu Kai** [丘开], yet ultimately brought ruin upon themselves, or the **Yu family**, who were injured by a crossbow bolt meant for an assassin because of a rotting rat—these were all those who bore the look of arrogance.
Thus, the later generations withdrew their caution:
**One: Great names do not endure.**
When achievement is complete and reputation is fulfilled,
the Sage, in all matters, thinks deeply.
When holding great things and fearing excess, one fears them as if they were nothing—yet still does not guard against them.
Thus, holding to excess is not as good as ceasing.
Ease is simple; action is difficult.
Action cannot avoid premeditation, and where premeditation arises, how can one remain unchallenged?
If challenged, one seeks victory; if victorious, the other is defeated.
To measure and sharpen—is this not a strategy for long preservation?
To hold gold and jade without burdening the heart, to dwell in wealth and nobility without arrogance toward others—these are what people find difficult.
To have is not as good as to not have; to act is not as good as to cease.

**Two: Align with Heaven and act accordingly.**
Retreat is the Way of Heaven.
At the decline of the sun, without drumming or singing, the aged sigh at misfortune—those who follow Heaven’s path, having achieved their purpose and fulfilled their name, withdraw in retreat.
They say, *"How could this burden me?"*
**Shao Ruo** [邵若愚] said: *"Holding to excess until one retreats is the Way of Heaven.*
To dwell in high status and thick profit is like holding a vessel full to the brim—always fearing it will topple, it is better to cease before it overflows.
Thus, the unfilled is easier to hold.
To measure and sharpen is to invite ruin.
Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them.
Wealth and nobility breed arrogance; arrogance and negligence lead to excess—this is not Heaven’s punishment, but self-inflicted ruin.
Yet how does one avoid this calamity?
Thus, the Sage observes the cycles of the four seasons: like spring’s transformation, when achievement is complete and reputation fulfilled, by summer one retreats and does not remain—this is the Way of Heaven.
**Wang Zhi Ran** [王志然] said: *"Holding to excess until one retreats is the Way of Heaven.*
What is beyond form is called the Dao; what is within form is called the vessel.
Within the realm of vessels, if there is fullness, there must be emptiness; if there is abundance, there must be decline.
To hold and guard, one must always fear self-excess—self-excess inevitably brings the disaster of collapse.
Thus, the ancients acted before harm arose and governed before disorder set in, vigilant and cautious, fearing only the loss of the means to reflect and amend.
The four cardinal virtues—ritual, righteousness, propriety, and shame—are the constants.
They dwell in substance, not in ornament; they always occupy the thick, never the thin.
The *Yijing* says:
*The Dao of Heaven diminishes excess and benefits humility;
The Dao of Earth transforms excess and flows toward humility;
Ghosts and spirits harm excess and bless humility;
Human nature abhors excess and loves humility.*
How perfect is humility as virtue!
Its root lies here; its branches lie there.
Holding to ancient ways, the Sage has never failed to value humility.
Its ultimate principle warns against overflow—
what is called *holding to excess is not as good as ceasing.*
Thus, holding excess is not as good as preserving humility;
measuring and sharpening is not as good as blunting sharpness.
To measure is to gauge others’ intentions;
to sharpen is to exploit others’ weaknesses.
Sharpness cannot be beneficial; benefit does not harm others.
As Mencius said: *"The archer fears injuring others; the crossbowman fears not injuring others."*
This is what should be blunted, not sharpened.
If one advances with sharpness, one’s retreat will be swift—
how could this endure?
This is its meaning.
External things cannot be relied upon—
people may claim them as their own, yet the Sage withdraws and avoids them.
Moreover, wealth and nobility are what people desire,
gold and jade are what people value—
if one knows how to accumulate but not how to disperse,
knows how to take but not how to give,
then one is no different from a great thief hoarding treasures."*

「Thus there are those who cling to their selfish private gains, insatiable even unto death, neglecting the cultivation of the fundamental Dao of life and death, and instead harming themselves—many perish without realizing it. How utterly foolish they are.

Laozi specifically warns: *"The more one loves, the greater the cost; the more one hoards, the heavier the loss."* Hence, those who understand the Dao recognize that wealth and nobility are ultimately insufficient to preserve one’s life. They do not cling to the transient advantages of a single lifetime for their own private gain, nor do they seek to dominate the world for the sake of display. When wealth accumulates to the point of overflowing the nation’s treasury, when nobility reaches the stage where titles and honors are bestowed upon all, when the distinctions between heaven and earth are blurred and great and small alike are governed by this principle—yet their own person remains untainted by wealth or nobility, their heart tranquil, never slighting even a single thing in their breast, though gold and jade fill their halls, they never grow arrogant or stingy. Their actions align with auspicious fortune, so what blame could there be?

The affliction of possessing a body is indeed grave. Yet, if one examines and reflects with care, what is truly valued is the absence of blame. When blame is absent, then where do misfortune, regret, and stinginess arise from?

To know how to advance yet not know how to retreat, to know how to preserve yet not know how to lose, to know how to gain yet not know how to suffer—how could one avoid regret?

If one achieves fame and success, yet grows proud and self-satisfied, boasting and flaunting, who in the world would not vie to contest their achievements?

The *Yijing* states: *"To know how to advance and retreat, preserve and lose, without losing one’s true course—is this not the unique attribute of the Sage?"*

The august Heaven has no partiality, only virtue does it assist. The yin and yang of heaven and earth create and transform all things; the four seasons proceed in their order, and the year’s harvest is fulfilled. When the harvest is complete, the season departs—Heaven says nothing of it.

If humans can embody this, they will harmonize with Heaven and Earth in virtue, with the sun and moon in luminosity, with the four seasons in order, and with the spirits and gods in fortune and misfortune. Heaven will not oppose them, and what of humans?

Thus the classics say: *"When achievements are complete, fame is secured, and one withdraws—this is the Dao of Heaven."* Students of the Way, how could they dare not strive to emulate this?

Huang Maocai remarks: *"To cling and fill to the utmost is impossible to sustain long."* The Dao is without attachment, yet one seeks to make it void. To cling and fill, is this possible? The Dao is without fixed form, yet one seeks to make it rigid. To measure and sharpen, is this possible? All these are rooted in *non*-Dao. Non-Dao is early decay; how could it endure?

Even when gold and jade fill one’s halls, it leads to self-inflicted blame. Gold and jade, as in the saying *"clad in coarse hemp yet holding jade in one’s bosom,"* are not of this world’s material wealth. Wealth and nobility, as in the saying *"those who know me are few, hence I am noble,"* are not of this world’s transient riches. The ancients had inner attainments; worldly affairs could not perturb their hearts. They valued the inner over the outer, prized themselves above external things.

Yet when it comes to arrogance, the disciples of Jian Kang in the Jin Dynasty indulged in lofty discourse, extolling profound mysteries, not without some grasp of the Dao. But by trampling others and scornful of the world, they ultimately met disaster. It is fitting that Laozi warned against this.

*"When achievements are complete, fame is secured, and one withdraws—this is the Dao of Heaven."* Achievement here means *"achievement without attachment,"* not the world’s so-called achievements. Fame here means *"fame without self-aggrandizement,"* not the world’s so-called fame. When achievements are complete and fame is secured, yet one withdraws—observing the sequence of the four seasons reveals the Dao of Heaven.

Laozi, Zhuangzi, Liezi, Fan Li, the Four Worthies, Anqi Sheng, and Dongfang Shuo were Sages of the ancient times. Yet the histories do not record their final fate—is this not because the Dao was fulfilled and they withdrew, leaving no trace for mortals to know?

Cheng Tai remarked: *"It is better not to cling and fill at all."* Fame, success, wealth, and nobility—when one reaches their utmost measure, this is called *"filling."* Above the point of filling, there is only collapse and overflow. Why strain anxiously to cling and hold, pushing toward the extreme, when it would be better to extinguish such thoughts and leave room for natural overflow? Hence the saying: *"It is better not to cling and fill at all."*

To measure and sharpen cannot be sustained long. If one fixates on the idea that *"offices and emoluments are insufficient to fill,"* then in one’s pursuits, the fear is of ever becoming dull. Thus, one preemptively gauges and calculates; when opportunity is seen, one acts with sharp precision. Those who follow such schemes may indeed succeed. Yet the measuring is in oneself, while the opportunity lies with others; guessing and often hitting the mark is mere luck. Even if one often succeeds by luck, there remain instances where luck fails, and this is the rigid insistence on what cannot be guaranteed. How could one expect such fleeting luck to become a constant? Hence, *"it cannot be sustained long."*

When gold and jade fill one’s halls, yet one withdraws—this is the Dao of Heaven. If wealth is gathered yet cannot be preserved, those who possess it grow proud with their abundance, and pride leads to ruin. Recognizing the cycle of filling and emptying, abandoning fame and success without clinging to them, this is to walk with Heaven. Without pride, one cannot speak of it.

Discussing the movement of the four seasons, the accomplished withdraw. This is precisely what Laozi meant by the Dao of Heaven. Yet the world hears it as if not hearing. They see the possibility of dwelling in success, yet fail to grasp the true principle of void and fullness.

Qijingshuai, the Duke of Qi, lamented the wealth of his state, considering death a tragedy. Yanzi laughed at him: *"If the ancients never died, then Taigong and Wenzi would always guard it. Would you, my lord, wear a patched robe and till the fields, with no time to ponder death?"* For they take turns in their roles, take turns in departing, and yet return to the lord. Yet you alone weep—is this not unkind?

In saying this, he was pointing out the alternating cycles of the four seasons, the successive phases of filling and emptying, and their relation to life and death, gain and loss. Hence, Liezi expounded on the mutual urging of life and transformation, saying: *"The living cannot avoid living; the transforming cannot avoid transforming."* He also spoke of the opposing balance of excess and deficiency: *"What is lost to one is gained by another; what is gained here is lost there."*

The transforming cannot avoid transforming, for it is the condition of the living’s inability to remain unborn. If this fullness and completion were not drawn from the other, yet the other must inevitably suffer loss and decay—how then could this fullness and completion be sustained without the other’s loss?

「From this perspective, the alternating cycles of departure and return are precisely the teachings of the Old Master [Laozi]. He spoke of those whose accomplishments are complete and whose reputation is fulfilled, yet whose fate demands they must withdraw.

Indeed, accomplishments and fame are the fruits of a profession brought to fruition. Wealth and honor are the gatherings of rank and emolument. Examining the affairs of the world, the number of ranks and emoluments in one age is fixed. Therefore, those who entrust their profession to others must also remain within this same age. If talented and wise individuals were to constantly monopolize these gains, then those who teach and guide with humility would have no place to welcome them.

Thus, when new arrivals come, the already accomplished must retreat—this is the inevitable succession of the four seasons. Hence, the Daoists, regarding the world, initially refuse to lightly accept responsibility for others, and ultimately do not wish to long remain in positions of success.

Like the disciples of Zhang Liang [in his retreat to the Garden of Fine Brocade], they could look down upon the calamities and humiliations of Xiao He and Han Xin with a smile, all having perceived this truth.

But for those who ascend to become sages, the matter is grander still. They say: *"To harmonize with the virtue/power of Heaven and Earth, to align with the sequence of the four seasons, advancement and retreat, life and death—all proceed without deviation."* This is far beyond those who fear fullness and seek safety, for they cannot be compared.

Zhan Qiu Pu said: *"The Dao of holding while full is to withdraw when Heaven demands."* The passage of *Yun Yi Zhang* [《运夷章》] elaborates: *"Yun"* means "use," *"Yi"* means "balance."* To hold until fullness overflows, to grasp until sharpness is extreme—when gold and jade accumulate to fill the hall, when wealth and honor lead to extravagance and arrogance, these are not the paths of balance. They are the roots of calamity and ruin.

True balance lies in the passage of *Yun* alone. Therefore, when accomplishments are fulfilled and reputation is complete, one must courageously withdraw. This is in accordance with Heaven’s Dao, which is as such. One cannot know advancement without knowing retreat.

Zhang Chong replied: *"The Dao of holding while full is to withdraw when Heaven demands."* Just as the sun reaches its zenith and then declines, the moon attains fullness and then wanes, and torrential rain cannot last an entire day—Heaven’s Dao operates thus, and how much more so for humanity?

Humans understand that Heaven’s Dao abhors excess and advocates humility, tempering sharpness and avoiding overreach. Thus, when fullness accumulates within oneself, one must swiftly consider self-restraint. Yet, if one persists in greed for wealth and position, they will invite harm to their spirit and body, bringing ruin upon themselves.

When sharpness is directed toward others, one must quickly reflect on tempering it. If they continue to nurture malevolence and harm others, they will provoke retaliation and endanger themselves. To forget fullness and not know restraint is to let gold and jade fill the halls, only to attract disaster—none can guard against it.

Wealth and honor leading to arrogance, while harboring sharpness, will only bring self-inflicted blame. If one remains still and unmoving, what blame could there be?

When accomplishments are complete and reputation is fulfilled, it is like the moon reaching the center of the sky—then comes the time of cooling winds and rippling waters. The Dao of withdrawing when Heaven demands leaves room for retreat.

Liao Cui Ran said: *"The Dao of holding while full is to never be self-satisfied. The best course is to let go when it is already complete, to guard oneself with enduring strategy."*

*"The Dao of tempering sharpness is to not indulge in reckless thoughts—one must cut decisively."* *"To not long preserve is to avoid future calamities."*

Gold and jade fill the hall—
yet one does not prize external wealth,
only cherishing what is self-nourished.

None can guard it.
If one could preserve it,
would it not be wondrous?

Wealth and honor bring arrogance—
yet one should not covet extravagance,
for splendor comes naturally.

Self-inflicted blame arises.
If I act without contrivance,
what blame could there be?

When accomplishments are complete and reputation fulfilled,
one guards oneself with the Dao—
water flows to its course naturally,
yet one must not cling.

Withdrawing in retreat,
hidden like water in the depths—
this aligns with Heaven’s Way.
Effortlessly, from beginning to end,
one’s household moves without a single step.

Chen Bi Xu said:
*"To hold while full is not as good as stopping.
Fullness means excess;
stopping means restraint.
He who clutches at what is already overflowing,
yet knows not humility and self-effacement,
will surely see its collapse.
To guard against ruin,
it is better to plan for early cessation.
This is a solemn warning."*

Strictly speaking, *zhí ér yíng zhī* (积而盈之) refers to hoarding wealth and treasures.
*"To temper sharpness is to not long preserve.
*Describe* (揣) means to measure, also to refine;
*say* (说) means keen sharpness.
Men know only the sharpness of greedy desires,
pursuing wealth and honor,
yet recklessly indulge their passions,
unmindful of restraint—
disaster comes, and it cannot be long sustained."*

Strictly speaking, *yán jūn píng* said:
*"Wealth and honor to me are like ascending a mountain to gaze afar;
name and power to me are like a fleeting lightning bolt.
This is to say they cannot be long preserved."*

*The Hong Lie Explanation* says:
White Gong won Jing State,
yet could not distribute its treasuries to the people.
Seven days later, Shi Qi entered and said:
*"An unjust gain, yet unable to give—
calamity will surely come.
If unable to share with others,
it is better to burn it,
so none may harm it."*
White Gong did not heed this.
On the ninth day, Ye Gong entered
and opened the treasury’s wealth to give to the people,
drew arms from the high storehouse to tax the citizens,
and thus attacked him.
Nineteen days later,
White Gong was captured.
The state was not his to possess,
yet he sought to possess it—
this was extreme greed.
Unable to benefit others,
yet unable to benefit himself—
this was extreme folly.
What difference is there
between White Gong’s stinginess
and the owl’s love for its young?
Thus it is said:
*"To hold while full is not as good as stopping;
to temper sharpness cannot be long preserved."*

Gold and jade fill the hall—
none can guard it.
This proves that excess cannot be reversed;
it is the inevitable logic of holding fast.

Gold and jade fill the hall,
yet only moisten the house—
when great thieves arrive,
they bear away baskets and cases,
shoulders laden with sacks.
Even the wise cannot guard them.
Thus, the elephant has tusks yet burns its body,
the rooster fears the sacrificial knife and loses its tail.
Even beasts know this—
why do not men reflect?

Wealth and honor bring arrogance,
self-inflicted blame arises.
*Her* (遗) means to bestow.
Riches attract seekers,
so one easily deceives others.
Honor makes others submit,
so one easily oppresses others.
Deception and oppression grow unchecked—
calamity and blame must come.
Who else could bring it?

Strictly speaking, *yán jūn píng* said:
*"Gold and jade to the body,
name and power to the spirit—
like ice and fire,
they cannot coexist.
Thus, name is the defilement of the spirit,
profit is the harm to the body.
Nurturing the defilement of the spirit,
accumulating harm to the body—
it damages what I have achieved,
yet benefits what I should destroy.
Gaining it is called profit,
losing it is called harm—
then their thoughts are confused,
and their inclinations perverse."*

Again he said:
*"What benefits my wealth harms my spirit,
what brings me fame destroys my body.
Misfortune arises from within, not from others;
blessing arises from within, not from Heaven."*

Lu Xi Sheng said:
*"To hold a great vessel while full—
though one fears it, it is better to stop early.
To occupy a high position with arrogance—
though one worries, it is better to retreat early.
To grasp at advantage with sharp intent—
though one gains it, it cannot be long preserved.
To hoard gold and jade in the hall—
though one possesses it, one cannot long guard it.
Noble while arrogant brings its own ruin,
rich while arrogant increases its faults.
Arrogance springs from the heart,
blame arises from oneself.
How can one blame Heaven or reproach others?"*

When accomplishments are complete and reputation fulfilled,
retreat is Heaven’s Way.
This concludes the meaning.

Who, when great deeds are done and fame is achieved,
yet does not know to rest and withdraw?
Moreover, when fine birds are exhausted,
the good bow is hidden;
when the cunning hare is slain,
the hunting dog is boiled.
This is the way of things.
Only those who understand
Heaven’s Way of fullness and emptiness,
knowing advance and retreat, survival and ruin—
these are the Perfect Ones.

Xie Tu Nan said:
*"To hold while full cannot be long preserved.
How extreme is the thought of fullness—
not even a hair’s breadth should take root!
The *Yijing* says:
‘One fullness brings four losses,
one humility brings four gains.’
The hearts of Heaven, Earth, man, and ghost
are thus revealed.*

*Holding* refers to guarding what is within;
*describing* refers to measuring what is without.
If within there is a mind of excess,
one easily becomes arrogant toward others—
excess will surely fail,
so it is better to stop.
If without there remains unrefined sharpness,
one easily harms others—
sharpness will surely break,
so it cannot long endure.
This is why the Sage does not seek greatness,
does not seek height."*

Gold and jade fill the hall—
self-inflicted blame arises.
Gold and jade are precious treasures—
who does not love them?
Yet if accumulated without dispersal,
what is lost will be much.
Riches and honor—
who does not desire them?
Yet arrogance and contempt for others
will make enemies many.
Who bears the blame?

When accomplishments are complete and reputation fulfilled,
retreat is Heaven’s Way.
In this life, to labor without achieving results—
the gentleman finds this shameful.
To die without a worthy name—
the gentleman finds this shameful.
When deeds are done and fame is achieved,
then all that can be done is complete.
To preserve oneself in retreat,
knowing when to stop brings no peril—
Heaven’s Way of transformation unfolds naturally.

The discussion has been examined: Heaven has the four seasons, and when accomplishments are fulfilled, retreat is called for.

Reputation is like the Creator’s stingy bestowal—once achieved and perfected, if one cannot preserve oneself and avoid harm by retiring to leisure, if one is greedy for honor and risks favor, calamity will soon follow.

This is because one does not understand the principle of *consumption and replenishment*, the Dao of advance and retreat, of flourishing and decline. When *yang* is excessive, regret follows; when *yin* is exhausted, struggle ensues—even the *Heavenly Stem* and *Earthly Branch* cannot escape. How much more so for humanity?

Thus, the Yellow Emperor humbled himself before Broad Success’s inquiry, and Zi Zhang followed the wanderings of Chi Song—these are but one Dao.

Lin Yongzhai said: *"To hold and fill to excess until retreat is Heaven’s Way."* This chapter speaks only of how advance is not as good as retreat, thus using the metaphor of *holding fullness* and *sharpening to a point*.

A vessel filled to its brim will surely overflow; to hold it is difficult, yet it is easier not to fill it at all. *Already* means "do not fill to excess."

*Describe* (治) means *to govern*; *point* (锐) means *sharpness*. To govern a vessel until it reaches extreme sharpness—nothing can endure without breaking. It is better not to sharpen at all, for then it may endure long.

To amass wealth until gold and jade fill the hall—one cannot long preserve it. To occupy the rank of a prince and grow arrogant—one will surely invite blame.

Thus, those who wish to preserve their accomplishments and safeguard their reputation must know when to retreat, for this is Heaven’s Way. When accomplishments are fulfilled and reputation is achieved, it is a matter of their scale—those who can preserve themselves.

Hence it is said: *"fulfilled"* and *"achieved."* If one does not know when to stop, when is it fulfilled? When is it achieved?

Fan Yingyuan said: *"To hold and fill to excess cannot be long preserved. Fullness leads to overflow; to hold and fortify it is better than not stopping at all. Sharpness leads to fracture; to govern and sharpen it—how can it be long preserved? Gold and jade fill the hall, yet one invites blame by oneself. Greedy for wealth and reckless with life—one loses all while the treasures remain. Rich and noble yet arrogant and extravagant—one loses oneself and brings ruin to one’s descendants."*

The Master of the Riverbank said: *"When rich, one should rescue the poor; when noble, one should pity the lowly. If instead one grows arrogant and unrestrained, then calamity will follow."*

When accomplishments are fulfilled and reputation is achieved, retreat is Heaven’s Way. The movement of *yin* and *yang* runs its course—when accomplishments are fulfilled, retreat is Heaven’s Way. Humanity should emulate Heaven, so from ancient times to today, those who achieve accomplishments and reputation yet do not retreat are often met with disaster.

The words of Laozi are a mirror for ten thousand generations. Those like Zi Zhang alone align with Heaven’s Way.

Xue Yongzhai said: *"To hold and fill to excess is not as good as stopping."* A vessel filled to its brim will overturn—even if held, it is of no use. It is better to cease what is held and keep it balanced and upright.

To govern and sharpen to a point cannot be long preserved. A person’s sharp edges, even without grinding, will surely be injured in motion—though governed, they cannot be preserved.

Gold and jade fill the hall—none can guard them. Shi Chong, standing in the marketplace, said: *"My slaves profit from my wealth alone; none can guard it."*

Rich and noble yet arrogant—one invites blame by oneself. Han Xin, though wise in his many warnings, still demonstrated his power to King Qi, thus inviting the calamity of Yunmeng.

Guo Zhen, after twenty-four promotions to Chancellor, enjoyed wealth, nobility, longevity, and honor from beginning to end—what more could a subject achieve? What blame could there be?

When accomplishments are fulfilled and reputation is achieved, retreat is Heaven’s Way. Fan Li and Zi Zhang certainly knew this Dao. Did the Grandee Zhen and Li Si understand it?

Xiu Xiu An said: *"To hold and fill to excess until retreat is Heaven’s Way."* The wise do not govern fullness or sharpen to a point. Those who guard and wait for satisfaction should know that fullness brings loss—it is better to stop early. Those who govern and sharpen to a point know that sharpness brings fracture—it cannot be long preserved.

Gold and jade fill the hall—none can guard them. Time is limited, fleeting and swift; human wealth and nobility are but dreams. Some, when in wealth and nobility, should deeply reflect and awaken, seizing the time to cultivate the Dao and virtue, entering sainthood and transcending humanity. If one is ignorant, indulgent, and extravagant, blind to the Way, one invites blame by oneself.

Those who achieve accomplishments and reputation should early preserve themselves and retreat, gathering results from causes, thus aligning with Heaven’s Way. Those who followed Chi Song’s wanderings—like Zhang Liang.

Zhu Bo Xiu said: *"To hold and fill to excess until retreat is Heaven’s Way."* To hold things until they are full is to metaphorically speak of insatiable ambition, thus warning against not stopping. And not to govern and sharpen to a point—to avoid competing for gain and risking harm—thus declaring it cannot be long preserved.

Those who rush in pursuit of gain, reckless in their ambitions, until gold and jade fill the hall—will they not tread the path of *"wealth without virtue"*? Those who long dwell in wealth and nobility, without restraint, will grow arrogant and extravagant, corrupting their hearts and ruining their nature. Human and ghostly censure will have no escape—all this begins with excess, with not knowing when to stop.

Accumulating evil and inviting disaster, they end in self-destruction. The affairs of Yi Bu and Jin Gu can serve as a warning. Thus, those who hold should not let things fill to excess—if not filled, there is no need to hold.

The foolish know this yet take no heed, sweetly stepping into disaster. The gentleman, in this regard, weighs the heavy and light, acting with advance and retreat—not abandoning accomplishments and reputation, but clearly discerning Heaven’s principles of rise and fall, examining human affairs for what is permissible and what is not. Knowing that fulfilled accomplishments and achieved reputation have things to fear, they retreat and conceal themselves to nurture their virtue.

Thus, they see the honor of Heaven’s bestowal. Looking back on worldly gains and offices, they find them unworthy of pursuit.

The cycles of the four seasons run their course—when accomplishments are fulfilled, retreat is called for. If one defies this principle, one disrupts Heaven’s order—how much more so for human affairs?

Observing the ancient and modern heroes, few preserve their later years—worthy of sighs. Only those who perceive omens and know contentment can avoid misfortune in life and leave a fragrant name behind.

The sages have said: *"Without the strength to lift mountains or move tides, how could one turn back to see the cold place?"*

「Truly so. The *Niu Miao* transmission states: *"To hold and fill is not as good as to know when to stop."* By *hold*, it means *admonition*—when what one holds becomes full, it must overflow. Thus, it is seen that it is better to stop before reaching fullness than to hold until overflowing.

To dwell in *zhongyong* (the balanced middle) is to naturally avoid overflowing. Hence it is said: *"To know when to stop is better than to hold until full."*

In ancient times, Confucius observed in the temple of Duke Huan of Lu a tilted vessel, and asked its keeper: *"What is this vessel?"* The keeper replied: *"It is called the *yòu* (tolerant) seat vessel."* Confucius said: *"I have heard that the *yòu* seat vessel—when empty, it commands respect; when half-full, it stands upright; when full, it overturns. The ancient wise rulers considered this the ultimate admonition—is this not the meaning of 'to know when to stop is better than to hold until full'?"*

To probe and sharpen is not long-lasting. By *probe*, it means *test*; by *sharpen*, it means *unyielding strength*. When one is tested and found to be unyielding, it is certain that they lack *ren* (benevolence). Confucius declared: *"The unbenevolent cannot long endure adversity, nor can they long dwell in pleasure."* This is the same principle.

The ancients said: *"To associate with a virtuous person is like walking through mist and dew—though one may not be drenched, there is constant refreshment;
To dwell among the wicked is like standing between blades—though one may not be harmed, there is constant peril.*
Moreover, if one’s attire and bearing are not proper, others may already be inclined to dismiss them—how much more so for the unyielding, whose association cannot be long preserved?

Mencius said: *"When Shun ruled the world, he selected from the masses and raised Gao Yao—then the unbenevolent were distant indeed.
When Tang ruled the world, he selected from the masses and raised Yi Yin—then the unbenevolent were distant indeed.*
It is because the unbenevolent know they cannot long endure association. Hence it is said: *"To probe and sharpen is not long-lasting."*

Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them. Gold and jade are the world’s most precious treasures—though they fill the chamber, they are inherently valued by others, and what benefit do they bring to one’s *shìgōng* (worldly accomplishments)? This is the meaning of *"none can guard them."*

The *Tàishàng* (Supreme Sage) said: *"Wealth and honor cannot accompany one at death—when the Five Heavenly Messengers (*Wúcháng Shǐzhě*, the agents of fate) strike without warning, seizing the soul, the grand halls and lofty chambers are no longer inhabited, nor can one follow the swift chariots and fine steeds into the afterlife. Gold and jade, jewels and treasures, are but playthings for others—this is the meaning of 'none can guard them.'*
Wealth and honor bring arrogance, which invites one’s own downfall. Wealth and honor are *zūnróng* (eminence and grace); arrogance is *àomàn* (haughtiness and insolence). *Héi* (to invite) means self-inflicted; *jiù* (blame) means regret and remorse. The ancients said: *"Does wealth and honor make one arrogant, or does poverty make one arrogant?"*
The proverb states: *"Wealth and honor do not make one arrogant—if they do, the arrogance comes from within."*
Confucius said: *"The noble one maintains composure without arrogance; the petty one arrogantly lacks composure.*
To fail in dwelling in composure is to invite regret. The *Shū* (Book of Documents) says: *"Revelry and arrogance lead to ruin—this is to invite disaster oneself."*
Disaster and fortune come from no other source than one’s own actions—this is the meaning of *"to invite one’s own downfall."*

When accomplishments are fulfilled and reputation achieved, one must retreat—this is the *Dao* of Heaven. If one stands in the halls of power, their name inscribed on bamboo and silk, they may be said to have fulfilled accomplishments and achieved reputation. Yet if they know to seek retreat, hanging their official cap and refusing further office, this is called *shēntuì* (retiring oneself). Those who retire without overflowing are in accord with Heaven’s *Dao*.

For instance, Zhang Liang served Emperor Gaozu of Han, ranked among the feudal lords, yet he did not dare accept three thousand households—only saying: *"A seal and a title are enough."* Later, he left office and wandered with the *Chìsōng Zǐ* (Red Pine Immortal). Was this not retiring oneself?
Fan Li served King Goujian of Yue and achieved hegemony, then said: *"Under a great name, one cannot long remain."* He removed his official seal, set sail across the sea, and departed. These two men—fulfilling accomplishments without claiming them, achieving reputation and retiring—embodied the *Dao* of Heaven’s non-overflowing principle, were they not virtuous?

Yang Zhiren said: *"From 'to hold and fill' to 'retiring oneself' is the *Dao* of Heaven. To hold and fill means the sun reaches its peak at nine in the third month, while the moon wanes at two in the eighth month. In *xiūzhēn xuédào* (cultivating true *Dao*), lead and mercury transform into the most precious elixir—when the fire’s *huò* (alchemical potency) is complete and the *qi* is sufficient, one must retreat and not act further. If they fail to know when to stop, great disgrace will follow. Hence, 'to know when to stop is better than to hold until full.'*
It is because holding until full leads to overflowing—better to stop before that. Yet if one has not yet reached fullness, there must be greed. To probe and sharpen—how can this be long preserved?
Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them. Wealth and honor bring one to retire and conceal—this is to harmonize with Heaven’s *Dao*.

Shu Guang said to his son: *"I have heard that knowing contentment brings no disgrace, knowing when to stop avoids peril. When accomplishments are fulfilled and reputation achieved, this is the way—if one does not leave, fear will come with regret. Yet arrogance and indulgence in desires will surely harm one’s *shénqì* (spirit and *qi*), inviting one’s own downfall."*

When accomplishments are fulfilled without boasting, and reputation achieved without flaunting, the *Dao* is complete.

Qing Zhong said: *"From 'to hold and fill' to 'retiring oneself' is the *Dao* of Heaven. Fullness invites loss; modesty invites benefit. This is the *Dao* of Heaven, the essence of this chapter’s teaching.*
A vessel full to the brim will overturn—none hold it better than knowing when to stop.
A blade too sharp will break—if one further probes and grinds it, it cannot be long preserved.
Using objects as metaphors, it is to teach people to know when to advance and when to retreat.
Gold and jade fill the hall—one should stop there. Yet if they greedily seek more, though they possess this gold and jade, none can guard it.
Wealth and honor that permeate the heavens should prompt one to know when to stop. Yet if they further indulge in arrogance and self-indulgence, this is to invite one’s own downfall.»

The sun at its zenith must decline,
the moon at full must wane—
Heaven and Earth in fullness and emptiness
follow the ebb and flow of time.
When merit is complete and name is fulfilled,
one who knows to retreat—
is this not in accord with the natural *Dao* of Heaven?

Fan Li conquered Yue yet sailed away in a humble boat upon the Five Lakes,
Lu Zhonglian declined the thousand-gold reward at Liaocheng,
rejected the emperor’s title and fled the noble seals of Qin.
Zhang Zifang, though he humbled the tyrant Xiang Yu,
then drifted away to wander with the immortal Zhongshan.
All surpassed the figures of Qin and Han in grandeur—
these were those whose merit was complete yet who did not cling to it.

The *Yijing* says:
*"The virtuous one perceives the signs and acts—
waiting until the day is done is too late."*

The *Shiliu Xu* says:
*"To hold and fill is not as good as stopping.
All things under Heaven, when grasped and pushed to their fullest,
will inevitably invite ruin—
thus it is urged: ‘Better to stop early.’
‘Stop’ means ‘halt.’
It means: better to halt in good time."*

Power and influence are even more so.
To sharpen and probe it—
it cannot be long preserved.

The *Dao* is sought and found,
abandoned and lost—
this seeking is beneficial to what is obtained,
for the seeking lies within oneself.
Yet now, when one’s mind schemes and sharpens ambition,
even if one gains what is desired,
it is far removed from the virtue of *Dao*, *de*, and *renyi*.
How could it be long preserved? Is this not fitting?

Gold and jade fill the hall—
none can guard it.
Gold and jade are the supreme treasures of Heaven and Earth,
loved by all under Heaven—
though piled high in a grand hall,
those whose greedy hearts are never satisfied
truly cannot guard them.
Is this not the way of great thieves accumulating wealth?

Riches and honor bring arrogance—
one invites one’s own ruin.
The lords and kings, the most exalted in wealth and honor,
if they govern themselves with humility,
shall long enjoy Heaven’s blessings.
But if they lord it over the world with pride,
they bring ruin upon themselves—
who else is to blame?

When merit is complete and name is fulfilled,
one retreats—
this is the *Dao* of Heaven.
Merit and fame are the weightiest concerns of sages past and present.
Only when they are complete and fulfilled does one know to retreat,
thus preserving them—
this is the duty of those with great virtue.
How could it be the concern of petty wisdom?

Thus it is said: *"To hold and fill is the *Dao* of Heaven."*
The cycles of the four seasons,
the completion of merit—
this is the *Dao* of Heaven.
It is because the four seasons cannot but succeed one another.
This chapter’s true intent in *Laozi* is:
when merit is complete and fame is fulfilled,
to retreat early—
emphasizing that fullness must overflow,
sharpness must break.

A vessel full yet grasped—
better to halt and not cling.
A blade sharpened and probed—
it cannot be preserved long unbroken.
*"Probe"* means to sharpen it further.

Gold and jade fill the hall—
they invite robbers and cannot be guarded.
Riches and honor bring arrogance—
ruin and blame inevitably follow—
this is the natural order.

*Laozi* spoke thus,
desiring that people know contentment to avoid disgrace,
knowing when to stop to avoid peril.

In this world, people seek nothing but merit and fame.
When merit is achieved and name is fulfilled,
one should retreat—
for Heaven abhors fullness and favors humility.
Otherwise, clinging to fullness, sharpening ambition,
arrogance in riches and honor,
unknowing of contentment—
disgrace and peril will surely follow.

The *Yuan’an Resident* says:
*"To hold and fill is the *Dao* of Heaven."*
Fullness must overflow,
sharpness must break.
To fear overflow and forcefully grasp it—
better not to be full in the first place,
so there is no need to grasp.
To fear breaking and probe it with one’s hands—
better not to be sharp in the first place,
so there is no need to probe.

‘Fullness’ refers to power and status,
‘sharpness’ to talent and wisdom.
Gold and jade fill the hall—
this refers to talent and wisdom.
Riches and honor bring arrogance—
this refers to power and status.
Merit complete—power and status.
Fame fulfilled—talent and wisdom.

Gold and jade are objects of joy and admiration—
even storing them in a room is hard to guard,
let alone in a hall?
Even the hall is unsafe—
how much more so when it is full?
Thus, though one might watch with the keen eyes of Li Zhu
and defend with the strength of Bi Yu,
thieves would still seize them.
This illustrates how those who boast of talent and wisdom,
flaunting their fullness,
will inevitably be undone by external forces.
This is why great fame is hard to sustain.

Riches and honor are easy to lose and hard to secure—
even humility and retreat cannot guarantee safety,
let alone adding arrogance and excess?
This ruin is not wrought by Heaven,
nor does misfortune come from without—
all is self-inflicted.

This is why great merit is hard to preserve.
Only the wise, when merit is complete and fame is fulfilled,
retreat—
thus aligning with the *Dao* of Heaven.

"Retreat" carries two meanings:
in terms of power and status, it is *guitian* (withdrawal);
in terms of talent and wisdom, it is *qianxu* (humble retreat).
The *Dao* of Heaven is as the *Yijing* speaks of *xu-ying-yi-qian*,
and the commentaries say of the four seasons’ cycles—
those who achieve merit must retreat.

The people of Jin said of Lin Gong:
*"He can be said to have gold and jade filling his hall,"*
also referring to talent and wisdom.
The world interprets this as guarding wealth—
how shallow!

The Sage of Later Chapters, clad in coarse hemp yet harboring jade within—
could this truly be jade?

*《Zhuzizi Pangzheng》* records:
*《Wenzi》* states: "The Master Lao said:
If acquired through unrighteousness,
and not shared through generosity,
then calamity will befall oneself,
and one cannot be called a true person.
Nor can one differ from the owl that loves its young.
Thus, to hold and hoard it,
is not as good as letting it go.
To clutch and sharpen it,
cannot be long preserved.

Shi Tan said:
To hold and fill oneself with it,
is not as good as letting it go.
To clutch and sharpen it,
cannot be long preserved.
Gold and jade filling one’s hall,
none can guard it.
Rich and noble yet arrogant,
one invites one’s own ruin.

When merit is complete and fame is fulfilled,
retreat while still alive—
this is the Dao of Heaven.
To cling and be self-satisfied,
is not as good as stopping.
To clutch and polish with sharp edges,
cannot be long preserved.
Gold and jade filling one’s hall,
may depart at its appointed time,
and cannot be considered as something to be long guarded.
Rich and noble yet arrogant,
one invites one’s own ruin.

High position brings slander,
wealth invites thieves’ eyes.
Thus, when merit is complete and fame is fulfilled,
one must first retreat in person,
then can avoid ruin.
For the full will surely be diminished,
the spent will surely be exhausted—
this is the Dao of Heaven.

The *《Yijing》*’s *《Qian》* (Modesty) says:
The Dao of Heaven diminishes the full and benefits the modest,
the Dao of Earth transforms the full and flows into modesty,
the Dao of spirits harms the full and blesses the modest,
the Dao of humanity abhors the full and favors modesty.
*《Shu》* (Book of Documents) says:
‘The full invites loss, the modest invites benefit—
this is the Dao of Heaven and time.’

This aligns with the meaning of this chapter.
The earlier scholars said:
‘The Master Lao truly grasped the *《Yijing》*’s Modesty—
this is certain.’

*《Daode Zhengjing Jiyi》* Volume Fourteen concludes.
#1: The flaws of the feudal lords are severe—
according to *《Zuofu》*, "flaws" (*弊*) should be "wealth" (*币*).
Same below.
#2: In the *《Chunqiu》*’s *《Zhou Jingwang Zi Zi Zhuan》* (*传* likely should be *《傅》*).
#3: The wording of *Jiu San* (third hexagram of the ninth month) should be:
‘Check the *《Yijing》*, "nine" (*九*) should be "six" (*六*).’

**《Daode Zhengjing Jiyi》** Volume Fifteen:
**《Ningyuan Dashijuan’s Exalted Observations on the Chapter of *Changde* (Constant Virtue) and *Lu Xuanmiao Guan* (Mysterious and Profound Observations)**»

**Chapter on *Yingpo* (Nurturing the Vital Essence):**
*Considerations of Variations:*
The *Laozi* of the *Riverbank Master* (河上公) is titled *Chapter of What Can Be Done* (《能为章》),
while the *Laozi* of Zhao Shizhan (赵实庵) is titled *Chapter of the Profound True Meaning of Ebb and Flow* (《消息至真义章》).

*Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang* (唐明皇) expounds:
In the previous chapter, it is made clear that unrestrained indulgence and drowning in emotions,
or arrogance and excess, will bring misfortune.
This chapter illustrates that when one nourishes the spirit and cherishes *qi* without distraction,
there will be no blemish.

From *Yingpo* (Nurturing the Vital Essence) down to *Dixie* (Purifying Elimination):*
These teachings caution against bodily cultivation to preserve one’s *virtue/power* (德).
From *Airen* (Loving Others) down to *Mingbai* (Clarity):*
They demonstrate that perfecting *virtue/power* (德) can enable one to rule as a sovereign.

The conclusion with *Shengzhu* (Generating and Nurturing) signifies
the Dao’s mysterious function manifesting in all things.

Du Guangting (杜光庭) states:
This chapter clarifies the benefits of *Embracing the One* (抱一),
contrasting it with the folly of *Probing the Sharp* (揣锐) from earlier.
*Embracing the One* ensures the spirit is whole and the vital essence secure,
while *Probing the Sharp* leads to excess and inevitable ruin.

As for the subtleties of *attaining softness* (致柔) and *mysterious observation* (玄览),
the principles of *loving others* (爱人) and *governing the realm* (理国),
and the harmony of the Dao’s *generating and nurturing* (生畜),
it reveals the profound and mysterious *virtue/power* (德) of the *Commentary* (注).

Zhang Chongying (张冲应) responds:
The fifth chapter already expounds on the gate of *vital essence* (精气) entering and exiting.
This chapter further elucidates how *vital essence* (精) transforms into *qi* (气).
Thus, *What Can Be Done* refers to *vital essence* (精),
which can be refined into *qi* (气).

*Nurturing the Vital Essence and Embracing the One* (载营魄抱一):
One can remain steadfast without separation.
*Concentrating Qi to Attain Softness* (专气致柔):
The body can be as supple as an infant.
*Purifying Elimination and Mysterious Observation* (涤除玄览):
One can be without blemish.
*Loving Others and Governing the Realm* (爱民治国):
One can act without interference.
*The Celestial Gate Opens and Shuts* (天门开阖):
One can transcend duality.
*Clarity and Fourfold Reach* (明白四达):
One can be without knowing.
*Generating and Nurturing* (生之畜之):
The Dao generates without possession,
acts without reliance,
and nurtures without domination—
this is called *Mysterious Virtue/Power* (玄德).

*Considerations of Variations:*
One version reads:
*Nurturing the Vital Essence and Embracing the One*—
can one remain steadfast without separation?
*Concentrating Qi to Attain Softness*—
can one be as pure as an infant?
*Purifying Elimination and Mysterious Observation*—
can one be without blemish?
*Loving Others and Governing the Realm*—
can one act without interference?
*The Celestial Gate Opens and Shuts*—
can one transcend duality?
*Clarity and Fourfold Reach*—
can one be without knowing?
*Generating and Nurturing*—
The Dao generates without possession,
acts without reliance,
and nurtures without domination—
this is called *Mysterious Virtue/Power* (玄德).

*Nurturing the Vital Essence* (载营魄):
One alternate reading is *Zai* (哉), as seen in the *Zhu* (注) version,
which has been clarified below.

*Can one transcend duality?* (能无雌乎):
One version reads *Can one transcend the feminine?* (能无雌),
though this may not align with the original meaning.
In the *Commentary*, it states: *"Knowing its masculine, one can act without interference"* (知其雄能无为乎).
One version reads: *"Can one act without interference?"* (能无为乎).
Another version states: *"Loving others and governing the realm—*
*can one be without knowing?"* (爱民理国，能无知乎).
*Clarity and Fourfold Reach—*
*can one act without interference?"* (明白四达，能无为乎).

The *Riverbank Master* (河上公) explains:
*Nurturing the Vital Essence* (载营魄):
*Qi* (营魄) refers to the *hun* (魂) and *po* (魄).
Humans rely on the *hun* (魂) and *po* (魄) to sustain life,
and must cherish and nourish them.
Excessive joy or anger disturbs the *hun* (魂),
while sudden fright harms the *po* (魄).
The *hun* (魂) resides in the liver,
the *po* (魄) in the lungs.
Fine wine and rich meats corrupt the liver and lungs,
so when the *hun* (魂) is tranquil and aligned with the Dao,
the *po* (魄) will be secure, extending one’s lifespan and years.

*Embracing the One can remain steadfast without separation* (抱一能无离):
If one can *embrace the One* (抱一),
ensuring it does not depart from the body,
then it will endure eternally.
*The One* (一) is the primordial *vital essence* (精气) of *Great Harmony* (太和),
the source of the Dao.
Thus, it is said:
*The One permeates all under Heaven* (一布名於天下),
Heaven attains *The One* to be clear (得一以清),
Earth attains *The One* to be settled (得一以宁),
and sovereigns attain *The One* to establish righteousness (以为正).
*The One* enters as the mind,
exits as action,
is dispersed as benevolence,
and collectively named *The One* (总名为一).
*The One* (一) means
unified resolve without division (志一无二).

*Concentrating Qi to Attain Softness* (专气致柔):
If one guards *qi* (精气) with unwavering focus,
preventing its disorder,
then the body can respond with gentle compliance.

*Can one be as pure as an infant?* (能婴儿):
Can one be like an infant—
internally free from scheming,
externally free from governance—
so that *vital essence* (精) does not dissipate?

*Purifying Elimination and Mysterious Observation* (涤除玄览):
One should purify the mind,
making it pristine and clear.
The mind dwells in the deepest mystery,
observing all things with knowing insight—
thus it is called *Mysterious Observation* (玄览).

*Can one be without blemish?* (能无疵):
Can one avoid licentiousness and impurity,
so that purity can be without flaw or disease?

*Loving Others and Governing the Realm* (爱民治国):
For bodily cultivation, loving *qi* (气) ensures wholeness;
for governing the realm, loving the people ensures stability.

*Can one act without interference?* (能无为):
In bodily cultivation, one breathes *qi* (精气) without letting it be heard;
in governing the realm, one dispenses benevolence without letting it be known below.

*The Celestial Gate Opens and Shuts* (天门开阖):
*The Celestial Gate* refers to the *Purple Forbidden Enclosure* (北极紫微宫).
*Opening and shutting* refers to the cyclical transitions of the five phases.
In bodily cultivation, *the Celestial Gate* signifies the nostrils—
*opening* means inhaling,
*shutting* means exhaling.

*Can one transcend duality?* (能无雌):
In bodily cultivation, one should be like the feminine—
tranquil, still, and yielding.
In governing the realm, one adapts to changes,
harmonizing without discord.

*Clarity and Fourfold Reach* (明白四达):
One’s vision and hearing are as luminous as the sun and moon,
reaching all four directions beyond the eight extremes of the world.
Thus it is said:
*It is unseen when observed,
unheard when listened to—
its brilliance spreads to all ten directions,*
*shining resplendently and gloriously.*

*Can one be without knowing?* (能无知):
None can fully know the Dao’s fulfillment across all under Heaven.

*Generating and Nurturing* (生之畜之):
The Dao generates all things and nourishes them.
*Generating without possession* (生而不有):
The Dao generates all things without claiming ownership.
*Acting without reliance* (为而不恃):
The Dao’s actions are not done in expectation of reward.
*Nurturing without domination* (长而不宰):
The Dao nurtures all things without forcing them into service.
This is called *Mysterious Virtue/Power* (玄德).

It is said:
The Dao’s practice of *virtue/power* (德) is mysterious and unfathomable,
yet it seeks to make this known to people.

Wang Fusi (王辅嗣) states:
*Nurturing the Vital Essence and Embracing the One*—
can one remain steadfast without separation?
*Zai* (载) means *dwelling* (处).
*The Vital Essence* (营魄) is where humans naturally reside.
*The One* (一) is the true nature of humanity.
If one can dwell in the ordinary abode of humanity,
embrace the pure spirit of *The One*,
and remain steadfast without separation,
then all things will naturally submit.

*Concentrating Qi to Attain Softness*—
can one be as pure as an infant?
*Specialized* (专) means *committed to* (任).
*Attain* (致) means *to the utmost* (极).
If one commits to the natural *qi* (气),
reaching the utmost harmony of softness,
can one be like an infant with no desires?
Then all things will be whole and one’s nature attained.

Love the people and govern the state—
can one act without action?

To employ techniques and seek achievement,
to manipulate fate and seek concealment—
this is cleverness.

To gaze deeply without blemish,
is like abandoning the Sage.

To govern the state without cleverness
is to discard cleverness.
Can one refrain from cleverness?
Then the people will not flee,
and the state will govern itself.

The Celestial Gate opening and closing—
can one act as the receptive?

The Celestial Gate—
by which the world comes to be.
Opening and closing—
the juncture of order and chaos.
Sometimes opening, sometimes closing,
its course flows through all under Heaven—
thus it is called the Celestial Gate’s opening and closing.

Receptive yet not leading,
following yet not acting.
If the Celestial Gate’s opening and closing
can act as the receptive,
then all things will submit,
and one’s dwelling will be at ease.

Clarity and omniscience—
can one act without knowing?

If one is utterly clear and all-pervading,
without confusion or doubt,
can one refrain from action?
Then all things will transform.

The Dao is ever without action.
If lords and kings can uphold it,
then all things will submit.

To nurture life without blocking its source,
to raise without restraining its nature—
this is called *Xuan* virtue.

Not blocking its source, yet things grow of themselves—
what merit is there?
Not restraining its nature, yet things thrive on their own—
what labor is relied upon?
Things grow fully on their own,
not shaped by me—
virtue exists, yet no master—
what is this if not *Xuan*?

All talk of *Xuan* virtue
is virtue without knowing its master,
emerging from the profound darkness.

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang said:
*Nurturing the Vital Essence and Embracing the One*—
can one remain steadfast without separation?

When humans first transform, it is called *po* (魄).
Once born, *po* becomes *hun* (魂) with the sun.
*Po* is yin and hollow,
*hun* is yang and full.
To dwell in the hollow *po*,
one must constantly nurture and restore the yang—
when yang *qi* is full, it becomes *hun*,
and *hun* in motion brings life’s completion.

*The One*—
unmixed.
Restoring yang completes life,
untainted and pure.
Thus, to embrace and guard the pristine *One*,
can one remain inseparable from the body?

*Commentary*:
*Load* (载) means *beginning*.
*Ying* (营) means *nurture*.

The birth of humanity begins with transformation,
yet only a hollow form exists.
Once *po* emerges, yang *qi* fills the hollow *po*,
and when *po* moves, it is called *hun*—
like the moon’s shadow reflecting the sun’s light.

Thus, Confucius’ disciple Zǐchán said in *The Spring and Autumn Annals*:
“When humans first transform, it is called *po*;
once born, *po* becomes *hun* with the sun.”
Speaking of humans bearing the hollow *po*,
one must nurture and guard the yang *qi*,
constantly ensuring its fullness—
then life is complete.

If movement and use are not steadfast,
yang *qi* scatters, returning to hollow *po*,
and death ensues.

*Zhuangzi* says:
“Do not let the near-dead revive their yang.”
Thus, one must nurture and guard the hollow *po*,
restoring yang to achieve full life.

Embrace and guard the pure *One*,
untainted by mixture—
can one remain inseparable from the body?
Then life is complete.

This is the teaching of nurturing the spirit.

Can one focus the *qi* to attain softness,
like an infant?
Focus the unified, harmonious *qi*,
bringing it to gentle equilibrium—
can one be like a newborn, undifferentiated?

*Commentary*:
*Focus* means *unified*.
*Qi* refers to the subtle, harmonious *qi*.
Human birth originates from this harmonious essence.
If defiled by worldly attachments,
the harmonious *qi* disperses,
and the spirit fails to sustain the body.
Thus, one must focus on the unified, harmonious *qi*,
attaining gentleness like an infant,
unattached to anything.

This is the teaching of nurturing the *qi*.

Can one purify and refine *Xuan* perception,
free of blemish?
*Xuan* perception—
the mind’s illumination.
*Blemish*—
flaws and afflictions.
Wash and refine the mind’s illumination,
making it clear and pure—
can one be free of flaws?

*Commentary*:
*Purify*—to cleanse.
*Refine*—to regulate.
*Xuan* perception—the mind’s illumination.
*Blemish*—affliction.
Human attachments arise from desire.
One must cleanse and regulate,
making the mind’s illumination clear and pure,
so desire does not arise—
can one be free of affliction?

This is the teaching of cultivating the mind.

Can one govern the people and rule the state
without action?
Nurturing the myriad people,
administering state affairs—
can one act without interference?
Then transformation will be self-wrought.

Teaching begins with nurturing the *po*—
all instruction is for self-cultivation.
When the self is cultivated, virtue is complete,
and one may become a ruler.

*Commentary*:
To love the people is to prevent sudden violence,
to labor without harming their nature.
To govern the state is to prioritize agriculture,
valuing grain, simplifying duties—
then the people will find peace in life,
transformed without words.

This is *wuwei*.

Can one do this?

The Heavenly Gate opens and shuts—
can one remain receptive?

The Heavenly Gate is where the Mandate of Heaven issues forth.
Opening and shutting refer to order and chaos—
when the sovereign receives the Mandate in due time,
if one remains receptive and still,
then one may long endure the Heavenly Blessing.

Another interpretation:
*The Classic of Changes* says:
"One opening, one shutting—this is called transformation."
The Sage governs the Dao, responding to change without rigidity,
not fixating on dominance but embracing receptivity—
like the Heavenly Gate’s opening and shutting,
yielding when full and humbling when diminished.

*Commentary:*
To cultivate virtue and become a ruler—
though one receives the Mandate of Heaven (the Heavenly Gate),
the sovereign’s Mandate originates from Heaven.
Opening means receiving the Mandate,
shutting means abdication.
Heaven bestows the precious Mandate upon the virtuous—
if one remains receptive and yielding,
one may enjoy supreme blessing.

Thus it is asked: Can one remain receptive?

Illuminated and far-reaching—
can one remain unknowing?

If the sovereign remains receptive and still,
the myriad people joyfully extol their virtue,
illuminated like the sun’s fourfold radiance—
yet though forgotten, they do not rule.
Thus it is asked: Can one remain unknowing?

*Commentary:*
Once the sovereign receives the Mandate and governs all under Heaven,
if they remain receptive and still,
their virtue shines like the sun’s illumination,
reaching all under Heaven.
Their influence extends to all things,
yet they do not claim it as their own—
this is called "forgetting merit as if unknowing."

Thus it is asked: Can one remain unknowing?

Nurture and sustain life.

*Commentary:*
The lower text says: *The Way gives birth, virtue nurtures.*
Here it says "nurture and sustain"—
the sovereign follows the pure Way,
allowing all things to fulfill their natural growth,
and through virtue, broadly aids them,
so each may fully realize their sustenance.

Thus: "Nurture and sustain."
To give birth yet not possess—
this is called the Mysterious Virtue.

To allow all things to fulfill their growth,
yet not claim it as one’s own—
to act yet not rely on merit,
to lead yet not rule—
if the sovereign can do this,
this is called the profound Mysterious Virtue.

*Commentary:*
Things fulfill their growth—
the Sage forgets their deeds.
Growth is naturally sufficient,
forgetting merit ensures its permanence.
This is to achieve the private through the impersonal,
to rule without ruling.

Thus: "To give birth yet not possess"—
to allow all things to fulfill their growth,
the sovereign does not claim it as their own.
"To act yet not rely"—
to allow all things to move freely,
acting without arrogance,
not attributing deeds to oneself.
"To lead yet not rule"—
standing above the myriad people,
thus called "lead."
Not relying on merit,
thus called "not rule."

So this is called the profound Mysterious Virtue.

Du Guangting says:
Carrying the *po* and embracing Oneness—
can one remain undivided?

*Carrying*—the *po* bears it.
The human body is where spirit and *qi* reside,
where soul and *po* dwell.
The body moves like a carriage bearing objects.
*The Western Ascension Scripture* says:
"The body is the spirit’s carriage."
Since it is likened to a carriage,
it must bear and move.

The *po* is empty and substantial—
the form of *yin* *qi*, the human shape.
The spirit is formless *yang* *qi*—the human essence.
If form is present yet *yang* *qi* has not descended,
one is inert, like a lifeless stone or withered tree.
When *yang* *qi* descends, movement becomes possible.
Thus, form is called *po* (belonging to *yin*),
and spirit is called soul (belonging to *yang*).

As long as there remains even a thread of *yang* *qi*,
one does not die.
As long as there remains even a thread of *yin* *qi*,
one does not become immortal.
Thus, refining *yin* *qi* to exhaustion grants transcendence to the Nine Heavens—
immortality is the companion of *yang*.
Refining *yang* *qi* to exhaustion plunges one into the Nine Abysses—
the ghostly state is the companion of *yin*.

Therefore, one must preserve the *yang* soul
and nurture the *yin* *po*
to preserve life entirely.

*Embracing Oneness*—this is guarding the Dao.
Restraining the soul and governing the *po*,
the foundation is guarding the Dao.
To command one to guard the Dao,
restraining and governing—
can one remain undivided?

The empty form—
when substance first takes shape, it is called *xiàng* (image).
*Xiàng* means resemblance.
Like the moon’s arc reflecting the sun’s light—
*The Heavenly Primordium Scripture* says:
"The moon is *yin* *qi*, having form yet no light."
The sun is the essence of the Great Yang,
constantly following the Yellow Path eastward.
In one day and night, it travels one degree and more—
one degree equals 2,932.32 *li*.
The moon is the essence of Great *Yin*,
its shape round, its essence pure.
It borrows the sun’s light to reveal its body—
where the sun does not shine, it is called the *po*.
It constantly follows the Yellow Path eastward,
sometimes deviating above or below it.
Its speed varies—
at its slowest, it travels 12°19'2" per day,
averaging 13°37',
at its fastest, 14°9'13"—
slowing when swift, swift when slow.
In 27 days and 52/81 parts of a day,
the sun travels 417/81 parts of a degree—
this is the end of its slow and fast phases.
Then it begins anew.
Each month at the new moon, it aligns with the sun—
this is called *hézè* (conjunction).
When the moon moves swiftly and the sun slowly,
after three days, the *po* appears.
Beyond three days, its light gradually grows.
On the first quarter, the sun shines on its side,
so from Earth, one sees it partially illuminated.
At the full moon, the sun and moon face each other,
Earth lies between them,
so its form is round and its light full.
When the full moon appears in the east at dawn,
this is called *cè* (lateral)—
it moves slowly.
When the new moon appears in the west at dusk,
this is called *xiǎo* (dawn)—
it moves swiftly.

*The Heavenly Response* says:
Its light is void like the sun’s—
when the sun’s light is not extreme, it is called *ànxū* (dark emptiness).
When *ànxū* aligns with the moon, there is a lunar eclipse;
when it aligns with a star, the star vanishes.
When the sun and moon are at new or full phase
and travel the central path,
they align with *ànxū* and are eclipsed.
The sun and moon each span three thousand *li* in circumference,
with a diameter of one thousand *li*.

「When a person first transforms, they are called *pò* (embryo of the spirit).

In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Zhao of the State of Lu (7th year of his reign) records:
At first, the Lord of Zheng (郑伯) had a policy, but was killed by Si Dai (驷带).
The Zheng people were alarmed and said: *"The Lord of Zheng has come!"*
Some dreamed of the Lord of Zheng, who declared:
*"On the day *rénzǐ* (壬子), I will kill Si Dai."*
The next year, Si Dai was killed.
The year after that, Gong Sun Duan (公孙段) was killed.
The Zheng people grew even more fearful.
Some asked Zi Chan (子产):
*"Can the Lord of Zheng still act as a vengeful ghost?"*
Zi Chan replied:
*"When a person is born, their shadow is called *pò* (embryo of the spirit), and their luminous essence is called *hún* (spirit-soul).
If one’s vitality is strong, then their *hún* and *pò* are powerful.
Even ordinary men and women, if they die violently, can still cling to the living and bring calamity and evil influence (*yínlì*—淫厉).
How much more so the Lord of Zheng, who held political power for three generations—
his spirit was strong, and he could still act as a vengeful ghost.
This is why he was called the Lord of Zheng:
He was a descendant of Duke Mu of Zheng (穆公), the grandson of Zi Liang (子良), and the son of Zi Er (子耳).
Thus, it is said that he held power for three generations.
Zi Chan then established Zi Liang Zhi (子良止) to appease him, and the disturbances ceased.*

*"The mind at death, preventing it from returning to vitality"*—
this is the phrase from the *Zhuangzi’s* "齐物篇" (齐物 *Qíwù*—"Equalizing Things").
Because of his suffering and misfortune, his lingering spirit was bound by determination and could still act as a vengeful ghost.
This is like Nan Guo Zi Qi (南郭子綦) answering Zi You (子游) on the meaning of *Tiān Lài* (天籁—the "Heavenly Response").

*Purity and unity (*chúnyī*—淳一), without separation (*bùlí*—不离)—*
this means harmonizing and refining, removing impurities and stopping chaos, so that nothing is mixed.
The *Laozi* (老君) understood this principle of nurturing the *pò* (embryo of the spirit) and maintaining unity,
and thus taught people how to cultivate their *shén* (神—spirit).

The *Shàngqīng Yǐnshū* (上清隐书—"Hidden Scriptures of the High Clarity") speaks of the methods of *Yùyí Bēnrì* (郁仪奔日) and *Jiélié Bēnyuè* (结璘奔月)—
the *Dao* (Way) of chasing the sun and moon.
It states that within the sun and moon, there dwell five *Dì* (帝—Celestial Sovereigns).
By calling upon the taboos within the sun and moon,
and visualizing the forms and attire of the five *Dì*,
they descend to bestow upon you their blessings.
Thus, you absorb the radiance of the sun and moon,
and those who practice this method can live as long as the sun and moon themselves.

It also speaks of the method of *Jūhún Zhìpò* (拘魂制魄)—
controlling the spirit-soul (*hún*) and restraining the embryo of the spirit (*pò*).
On the 3rd, 13th, and 23rd days of the lunar month,
one focuses on the transformation of the red *qi* (赤气) within the mind,
and invokes the names of the three *hún* (三魂):
*Tāiguāng* (胎光—"Fetal Light"), *Shuǎnglíng* (爽灵—"Vigorous Spirit"), and *Yōuxīng* (幽精—"Mysterious Essence").
Then, through secret incantations (*mìzhòu*—密咒), one binds the spirit-soul (*jūhún*—拘魂).
On the new moon, full moon, and waning days,
one focuses on the transformation of the white *qi* (白气) at the tip of the nose,
and invokes the names of the seven *pò* (七魄):
*Shīgǒu* (尸狗—"Corpse Dog"), *Fúshǐ* (伏矢—"Hidden Arrow"), *Qiǎoyīn* (雀阴—"Sparrow Shadow"), *Tūnyé* (吞贼—"Devouring Thief"), *Chúhuì* (除秽—"Removing Filth"), *Chòufèi* (臭肺—"Foul Lung"), and *Fěidú* (非毒—"Non-Venom").
Then, through secret incantations (*mìzhòu*—密咒), one restrains the embryo of the spirit (*zhìpò*—制魄).
Each has its own method of concentration and incantation,
as detailed in the *Shàngqīng Pǐnzhōng* (上清品中—"High Clarity Canon").
Practiced diligently over time, this can enable one to move effortlessly (*qīngjǔ*—轻举).

This is the *Tàishàng* (太上—"Supreme Venerable")’s method of nurturing and protecting the ethereal embryo of the spirit (*yūpò*—虚魄),
and transcending the world to achieve longevity (*dùshì chángshēng*—度世长生).

Can one concentrate their *qi* to achieve such softness (*zhìróu*—致柔) as a baby?
A baby does not yet know, and yet answers questions with ease.
They are entirely devoted to the pure and harmonious *qi*,
untainted by external influences and free from internal thoughts and worries.
Their nature follows the softness of *qi*, so their pure and harmonious *qi* does not disperse.

Those who guard the *Dao* should be like babies—
free from external defilements and internal thoughts,
so that their spirit does not leave their body.

The *Xīshēng Jīng* (西升经—"Scripture of the Rising in the West") says:
*"It is better to pity oneself than to pity others,
better to love oneself than to love the spirit,
better to contain the spirit than to love it,
and better to guard the True than to contain the spirit.
Guarding the True ensures lasting existence."*

It also says:
*"The spirit loves the body, but the body does not love the spirit.
Thus, the *Laozi* teaches people to nurture the spirit and *qi*."*

Can one purify and refine (*xǐchú xuànlǎn*—涤除玄览) to avoid flaws?
The mind’s illumination (*zhīnguāng*—心之照) penetrates all existence and non-existence,
spanning the heavens and earth.
It responds to circumstances immediately and moves with the environment.
If one does not regulate it with clarity and purity (*chéngjìng*—澄浄),
then it will be entangled by desires and sink into defilements (*dònglún rǎn yù*—动沦染欲).
Once entangled by desires, all evils arise (*wàn’è shēng*—万恶生).
When all evils arise, diseases and calamities follow (*bìbìng zuò*—庇病作).
The *Laozi* warns against this:
Refine and purify the mind, cutting away desires (*jiǎnqù yùxīn*—翦去欲心).
When the mind’s illumination is clear and pure (*xīnzhào qīngjìng*—心照清浄),
there will be no flaws or diseases.

The *Xīshēng Jīng* says:
*"The spirit that gives life to me is the spirit (*shén*—神),
but the mind that harms me is the mind (*xīn*—心)."*
Thus, the teaching is to regulate the mind (*xiūxīn*—修心),
to control intentions and thoughts, and return to a state free from worries.

Can one govern the people and the state (*àimín lǐguó*—爱民理国) without action (*wúwéi*—无为)?
The people are the foundation of the state (*guóběn*—国本).
*Wúwéi* (无为) is the transformation of the *Dao*.
If one governs with the transformation of *wúwéi*—
loving and nurturing the people—
then the foundation of the state is secured.
If governance is harsh and oppressive (*zhèngzhèng kuāiyí*—政虐而苛),
then it becomes tyranny (*bàomì*—暴).
If taxes are heavy and labor burdensome (*fùzhòng yìfán*—赋重役繁),
then it harms the people’s nature (*shāngxìng*—伤性).
If one does not act according to the seasons (*shǐzhī bùyǐshí*—使之不以时),
then it disrupts agriculture (*fángnóng*—妨农).
If one does not practice frugality and simplicity (*bùmù jiǎnyuē*—不务俭约),
then the value of grain will diminish (*jiàngǔ*—贱谷).
This is the teaching on governing the state (*lǐguó*—理国).

The essence of being a ruler (*jūnzǐ*—君子) is to take the *Dao* as foundation
and *dé* (德—virtue/power) as root.
If one loses the *Dao* and virtue/power, how can they rule over the people?
This is the core of the *Laozi*’s teaching on governing the state.

Can one open and close the *Tiānmén* (天门—the "Heavenly Gate") without imbalance (*wúcī*—无雌)?
Even after cultivating the love of the people and the governance of the state,
and becoming a ruler who sits in state (*chuíyī nánmiàn*—垂衣南面),
one must still respect oneself and follow Heaven,
to align with the natural order (*lìshù*—历数).
*Lìshù* refers to the received mandate (*shòumìng*—受命) of Heaven
and the cycles of the *Wǔyùn* (五运—the Five Phases).

Shun commanded Yu:
*"The mandate of Heaven and its cycles rest upon you."*
When the celestial blessings (*tiānlù*—天禄) are eternal and enduring (*yǒngzhōng*—永终),
it means that the mandate and cycles are upon you,
to inherit Heaven’s command and thus become a great treasure (*dàbǎo*—大宝) for the people.
This is called *bǎomìng* (宝命—"treasured mandate").
It is granted from Heaven, hence it is said to be received from Heaven.
The *Yìjīng* (易经) *Xì* (系) says:
*"The greatest treasure of the sage is called ‘position’ (位)."*
When the *Tiānmén* (天门) opens, extraordinary celestial omens descend (*jiàngfēicháng*—降非常之瑞),
such as the Yellow Star moving with vibrant colors (*huángxīng dòngcǎi*—黄星动彩),
the Red Star appearing and displaying auspicious symbols (*chìfú biǎofú*—赤伏表符),
the Purple *Qi* (气) filling the courtyard (*zǐqì chōngtíng*—紫气充庭),
the Five Stars gathering at the Well (*wǔxīng jùjǐng*—五星聚井),
the Rainbow flowing through the moon (*liúhóng guànyuè*—流虹贯月),
the Great Thunder encircling the celestial axis (*dàdiàn rào shū*—大电绕枢),
and the celestial blessings descending upon mountains to bestow worthy ministers (*yìngyuè jiàngxián*—应天顺人, 拯物除害),
and the birth of stars to command assistance (*dànxīng mìngfǔ*—诞星命辅).
Thus, one responds to Heaven and follows the people,
relieving suffering and removing harm,
while inheriting the mandate and cycles to possess the world (*yǒutiānxià*—有天下).

But when a ruler loses their proper place (*lín yù shīsuǒ*—临御失所),
their punishments and policies become misaligned (*xíngzhèng kuāiyí*—刑政乖宜),
and the people rebel while kin abandon them (*zhòngpàn qīnlí*—众叛亲离),
then war and calamity arise (*bīngjiāo huòqǐ*—兵交祸起).
When rebellion and disorder emerge from below (*nìlùn shēngyúxià*—逆乱生於下),
the celestial signs manifest above (*qìxiàng jiànyúshàng*—气象见於上),
such as the sky splitting open (*xiāotiān kāi*—霄天开),
mountains collapsing and rivers drying up (*shānbēng chuānjié*—山崩川竭),
and disasters swarming like bees (*zāi xiōng fēngqǐ*—灾凶蜂起),
until the state perishes (*guówáng*—国亡).
This is the closing of the *Tiānmén* (天门).

The alternation of opening and closing is called *biàn* (变)—
as the *Yìjīng* (易经) *Xì* (系) states:
*"The meaning of opening and closing is that yin and yang follow in succession,
and the principles of dependence and withdrawal (*yīfú*—倚伏) are fulfilled."*

To diminish fullness and increase humility (*kuī yíng ér yì qiān*—亏盈而益谦)—
as the *Yì* (易) *Qián* (谦) *guà* (卦) states:
*"To reduce excess and increase humility,
just as the sun reaches its zenith and then declines (*rìzhōng zé jiǎ*—日中则昃),
and the moon, when full, begins to wane (*yuè yíng zé kuī*—月盈则亏)."*

The fullness, once diminished, then humility receives its benefit—
this is the power of dependence and withdrawal (*yīfú*—倚伏).

The **Laozi** admonishes: *"When a ruler receives the Mandate of Heaven and governs the people,
he must embody the receptive and tranquil virtue of the female,
practice governance of simplicity and non-action,
align with the natural course of Heaven,
and thus shepherd all under his care."*

Again, the *Yìjīng* (易经) *Xì* (系) states:
*"To close the door is called **Kūn** (坤).*
**Kūn** is yin.
**Obstructed** (*hé*—阖) is concealment.
All things first conceal themselves and then emerge—
like a room that opens and closes its doors,
hence it is called **closing the door** (*héhù*—阖户).*

**To open the door** (*pìhù*—辟户) is called **Qián** (乾).
**Qián** is yang.
**To open** (*pì*—辟) is **to give birth and nurture**.
Yang expands and gives birth to all things—
like a room that opens its doors.
This is also interpreted as **obstructed** (*hé*—阖) meaning **darkness** (*ànmèi*—暗昧),
and **to open** (*pì*—辟) meaning **clarity** (*zhāomíng*—昭明).
**One cannot rely on the masculine to achieve completion** (*bùkěyǐ xióngchéng*—不可以雄成).

The **Zhuangzi** (*Zhuangzi* **Dà Zōngshī**—庄子□大宗师) says:
*"Do not counter the few, do not rely on the masculine to achieve completion."
This means not to depend on one’s own achievements in dealing with things,
but first to preserve the receptive and tranquil virtue to transform them.*

**Clarity and openness** (*míngbái*—明白), **four-directional penetration** (*sìdá*—四达),
how can one **not know** (*wúzhī*—无知)?
**Clarity** (*míngbái*—明白) is **illumination by wisdom** (*huìzhào*—慧照).
A mind illuminated by wisdom penetrates without bounds—
radiant and open in all directions,
unobstructed by anything.
When its illumination is thus,
one must **reflect deeply** (*sīniàn*—思念),
and **meditative reflection** (*niànxīn*—念心) does not cling to perception,
just as if **without knowing** (*yóurú wúzhī*—犹若无知).
If one **strives to know** (*wù zhīyǒuzhī*—或务其有知),
then one **grasps at things** (*yǒusuǒ zhí*—有所执) and loses the **Dao/Way** (*shīdào*—失道).

A ruler bearing **exclusive perception** (*dújiàn*—独见) and **clarity** (*zhēngmíng*—明),
governing the four seas,
his governance **sharp and penetrating** (*qìzhá*—察察),
and the people **wither and decline** (*mín diāobì*—民凋弊).

The **Laozi** warns him to **forget his achievements** (*wànggōng*—忘功)
and **cease his illumination** (*xīzhào*—息照),
just as if **plugging his ears with coarse cloth** (*yǒngrú sèěr*—黈纩塞耳)
to shut out sound,
or **wearing a cap with drooping pendants** (*guānlǎng chuí mù*—冕旒垂目)
to obscure his vision.

**To give birth and to nurture** (*shēngzhǔ*—生之畜之).
The **Dao/Way** communicates to give birth to all things—
hence it is said **to give birth** (*shēngzhǐ*—生之).
**Virtue/power** (*dé*—德) nourishes and sustains all things—
hence it is said **to nurture** (*zhǔzhǐ*—畜之).

The **Emperor** (*dìwáng*—帝王) follows the **Dao/Way** (*fǎdào tǐtiān*—法道体天),
entrusts the **nurturing and giving birth** (*rènwù shēngzhǔ*—任物生畜) to all things,
each fulfilling its allotted portion (*gè suì qí fèn*—各遂其分),
each expressing its inherent nature (*gè dá qí qíng*—各达其情),
all finding their proper place (*xián dé suǒyí*—咸得所宜),
and nothing **loses its place** (*wù wú shīsuǒ*—物无失所).

**Law** (*fǎ*—法) is **principle** (*zé*—则).
**Emulation** (*xiào*—效) is **learning** (*xué*—学).
**To give birth without claiming possession** (*shēng ér bùyǒu*—生而不有) until this point is called **Mysterious Virtue** (*Xuándé*—玄德).

A ruler **embraces and guards** (*bàoshǒu*—抱守) **primordial unity** (*chúnyī*—淳一),
**cleanses his mind** (*xǐxīn nèizhào*—洗心内照),
**loves the people** (*àirén*—爱人) and **governs the state** (*lǐguó*—理国),
**moves in accordance with Heaven’s timing** (*dòng fǎ tiānshí*—动法天时),
**receptive and tranquil** (*qījìng pínghé*—雌静平和),
**retiring his senses** (*shōushì fǎn tīng*—收视反听),
**embodies the Dao/Way to give birth to things** (*tǐdào shēngwù*—体道生物),
**aligns with virtue/power to nourish the people** (*shùndé yǎngrén*—顺德养人),
**gives birth to things without claiming their merit** (*shēngwù ér bùyǒu qí gōng*—生物而不有其功),
**governs without relying on his strength** (*wéizhèng ér bùshì qí lì*—为政而不恃其力),
**his perception and hearing open in all directions** (*wàishì tīngsìdá*—视听四达),
**his achievements accomplished without self-attribution** (*gōngchéng ér bùjū*—功成不居).

This is the **principle** (*lǐ*—理) of **self-cultivation** (*shēnlǐ*—身理) and **statecraft** (*lǐguó*—理国),
the **Dao/Way** of **universal love** (*jiān’ài*—兼爱) and **harmony with Heaven** (*shùntiān*—顺天).

**Mysterious** (*Xuán*—玄) is **Heaven** (*Tiān*—天).
**Dao/Way** (*Dàojūn*—道君) says: *"The **soul** (*pò*—魄) is carried."*
The **soul** (*pò*—魄) is yin,
**adhering to the body** (*lì yú tǐ*—丽於体) while having a place to rest.
Hence the **Old Master** (*Lǎoshì*—老氏) speaks of the **soul** (*pò*—魄) as **carrying** (*yíng*—营).

The **spirit** (*hún*—魂) is yang,
**entrusted to the breath** (*tuō yú qì*—托於气) without any obstruction.
Hence the *Yì* (易) speaks of the **spirit** (*hún*—魂) as **Dao/Way** (*dào*—道).

The **Sage** (*shèngrén*—圣人) **rules the body with the spirit** (*shén*—神),
**controls the soul with the spirit** (*hún*—魂),
hence the **spirit** (*shén*—神) **always carries the spirit** (*hún*—魂) but does not carry the **soul** (*pò*—魄).
Like a **chariot in motion** (*chē zhī yùn*—如车之运),
where all things are carried,
or like the **passage of the year** (*suì zhī xíng*—如岁之行),
where cold and heat alternate.
The **heart** (*xīn*—心) **wanders with Heaven** (*Tiān*—天),
**the six orifices** (*liùzáo*—六凿) **interact harmoniously** (*xiāngyīn*—相因),
**externalizing the Heavenly and Earthly** (*wàitiān dì yí wànwù*—外天地遗万物),
yet the **spirit** (*shén*—神) **never feels constrained** (*wúsuǒ kùn*—无所困).
How much less would it **cling to the soul** (*zhì yú pò*—滞於魄)!

**To embrace unity** (*bàoyī*—抱一), can one **not depart** (*bùlí*—离)?
Heaven’s **One** (*yī*—一) generates **Water** (*shuǐ*—水),
which in things is **essence** (*jīng*—精).
Earth’s **Two** (*èr*—二) generates **Fire** (*huǒ*—火),
which in things is **spirit** (*shén*—神).
**Essence and spirit** (*jīngshén*—精神) arise from the **Dao/Way** (*dào*—道),
the **body** (*xíng*—形) originates from **essence** (*jīng*—精).
**To guard without losing** (*shǒu ér wùshī*—守而勿失),
**to align with spirit** (*yǔshén wéiyī*—与神为一),
then **essence and spirit** (*jīngshén*—精与神) **merge and do not depart**.
**To gather essence and spirit** (*jīngshén*—以精集神),
**to direct spirit with the body** (*yǐshén shǐxíng*—以神使形),
**to preserve the body for spirit** (*yǐxíng cúnshén*—以形存神),
then **spirit is complete and not diminished** (*shén quán ér bùkuī*—神全而不亏),
**essence is used and not exhausted** (*jīng yòng ér bùjíng*—精用而不竭).
The **body emerges without decline** (*xíngshēng ér bùbì*—形生而不弊),
like the **sun and moon** (*rìyuè*—日月) **adhering to Heaven** (*lì yú tiān*—丽乎天),
like **grasses and trees** (*cǎomù*—草木) **adhering to the Earth** (*lì yú tǔ*—丽乎土),
never **departing** (*wùxiāng lí*—未尝离).

**Let me explain this thoroughly** (*qiècháng shēnzhī*—切尝申之):
A person’s **life** (*shēng*—生) arises from **gathering essence and spirit** (*jīngshén*—因精集神),
and **embodies the form** (*tǐxiàng sījù*—体象斯具).
**Four-directional penetration** (*sìdá*—四达) and **harmonious flow** (*bìngliú*—并流)
reach **all extremes** (*wùsuǒ bùjí*—无所不极),
**ascending to Heaven** (*shàng jiè yú tiān*—上际於天),
**descending to Earth** (*xià pán yú dì*—下蟠於地).
**Transforming and nurturing all things** (*huàyù wànwù*—化育万物),
it cannot be **represented by symbols** (*wùkě wéixiàng*—不可为象),
and its name is **harmonizing with the Emperor** (*tóngdì*—同帝).

Yet the **foolish of the world** (*shì zhī yúzhě*—世之愚者),
**enslaved by things** (*yì jǐ yú wù*—役己於物),
**losing their nature in customs** (*shīxìng yú sú*—失性於俗),
do not **preserve their spirit** (*cún qí shén*—存其神) even for a moment within,
**pursue boundless desires** (*chí wúqióng zhī yù*—驰无穷之欲),
**externalize their essence** (*wàishàng qí jīng*—外丧其精),
**the spirit reverses and follows the soul** (*hún fǎn cóng pò*—魂反从魄),
**the body reverses and burdens the spirit** (*xíng fǎn lěi shén*—形反累神),
and **descend with all things in transformation** (*yǔ wànwù jùhuà*—与万物俱化)—
how could they not be **bewildered** (*qǐbùhuòzāi*—岂不惑哉)?

The **Sage** (*shèngrén*—圣人) is otherwise:
**He carries the soul** (*zàipò yǐ yóu*—载魄以游),
**embraces unity to guard** (*bàoyī yǐ shǒu*—抱一以守),
**preserves the spirit in tranquility** (*tǐshén yǐ jìng*—体神以静),
and the **body will naturally rectify itself** (*xíng jiāng zì zhèng*—形将自正).
His **spirit** (*shén*—神) **extends to the Great Mountain** (*jīng yú tàishān*—经乎太山) without change,
**dwells in the deep springs** (*chǔ yú yuānguǎn*—处乎渊泉) without depth—
who knows its **origin** (*suǒshǐ*—所始)?
Who knows its **end** (*suǒzhōng*—所终)?
Hence it is said: *"The Sage values essence."*

**To concentrate the breath and achieve softness** (*zhuāngqì zhìróu*—专气致柔),
can one **be like an infant** (*néngrú yīng’ér*—能如婴儿)?
The *Yì* (易) states: *"**Qián** (乾) in its tranquility is concentrated."*
**Yang Xiong** says:
*"Softness and harmony suffice to settle all things,
**tranquility without mixture** (*jìng ér bùzá*—静而不杂) is called **concentrated** (*zhuān*—专),
**harmony without violence** (*hé ér bùbào*—和而不暴) is called **softness** (*róu*—柔).*
The **infant** (*yīng’ér*—婴儿) **dwells in ignorance of what to do** (*jū bùzhī suǒwéi*—居不知所为),
**moves without knowing where to go** (*xíng bùzhī suǒzhī*—行不知所之),
**does not store away distinctions of right and wrong, beauty and evil** (*bù cáng shìfēi měiwù*—不藏是非美恶),
hence **concentrates the breath and achieves softness** (*zhuāngqì zhìróu*—专气致柔).

**Mencius** says:
*"The **staggering** (*jué*—蹶) and **rushing forward** (*qū*—趋) are the **breath** (*qì*—气).
Yet **the heart** (*xīn*—心) **reverses its movement** (*fǎn dòng qí xīn*—反动其心),
and if the **heart is not capable of concentrating the breath** (*xīn bùzú yǐ zhuāngqì*—心不足以专气),
then the **breath has the staggering and rushing forward** (*qì yǒu juéquū*—气有蹶趋) that is **not upright** (*bùzhèng*—不正),
and the **heart reaches arrogance and insolence** (*xīn zhì yú fèngjiāo*—心至於偾骄),
becoming **unrestrainable** (*bùkě xì*—而不可系).

The **Sage** (*shèngrén*—圣人) **empties himself** (*xūjǐ*—虚己) to **wander in the world** (*yóushì*—以游世),
his **heart without forcing the breath** (*xīn wú shǐqì zhī qiáng*—心无使气之强),
then its **tranquility does not depart** (*jìng ér bùlí*—静而不离),
its **harmony is not violent** (*hé ér bùbào*—和而不暴),
and what **difference** (*xīxuǎn*—奚择) is there between it and the **infant** (*yīng’ér*—婴儿)?
Hence it is said: *"Can one be like the infant?"* (*néngrú yīng’ér*—能如婴兄).

**Mencius** says:
*"Its **bre

**Love the people and govern the state—can one truly be without action?**
To love the people with **ren** (*rén*—仁), to govern the state with **wisdom** (*zhì*—智),
to bestow **teachings** (*jiào*—教) and refine **laws and regulations** (*fǎzé*—法则),
and to **unify the world with goodness** (*shì shàn yī shì*—以善一世),
this is indeed far from **non-action** (*wúwéi*—无为).
The **Sage** (*shèngrén*—圣人) **benefits and nourishes** (*lìzé*—利泽) all generations,
yet does not **love the people** (*wéi ài rén*—为爱人),
his **achievements cover the world** (*gōng gài tiānxià*—功盖天下) yet do not **boast of himself** (*sì bùzìdé*—似不自己),
thus he is **without action** (*wúwéi*—无为),
**using the world yet having abundance** (*yòng tiānxià ér yǒuyú*—用天下而有余).

**The Celestial Gate opens and shuts—can one truly be without yielding?**
The **Classics** (*jīng*—经) say:
*"Know its **masculine** (*xiōng*—雄) and **guard its feminine** (*shǒu qí cí*—守其雌),
thus one becomes the **valley** (*wéi tiānxià wéi xī*—为天下溪) of the world."*
The **Sage** embodies the **Dao/Way’s** (*tiān dào*—天道) **transformations and changes** (*biànhuà*—变化),
**expanding and contracting, opening and closing without defying the times** (*juǎn shū qǐ bì bù wéi hú shí*—卷舒启闭不违乎时),
**manifesting the subtle interplay of firmness and gentleness** (*gāng róu jǐ zhāng—刚柔几彰),
**using them solely as he wills** (*wéi qí suǒ yòng—惟其所用).
Yet he **never forces himself upon others** (*wèi qí xiān rén—未尝先人) but **always follows their nature** (*ér qǐ suí rén—而尝随人),
**never overpowers things** (*wèi qí shèng wù—未尝胜物) but **always submits to their essence** (*ér qǐ xià wù—而尝下物).
Thus the world **delights in being led without growing weary** (*tiānxià lè tuī ér bù yàn—天下乐推而不厌),
and he **can truly be without yielding** (*néng wéi cí—能为雌乎), **here lies the answer** (*yú shì hú zài—於是乎在).

**Clarity and illumination in all directions—can one truly be without knowing?**
**Piercing wisdom and sagely insight** (*cōng míng shèng zhì—聪明圣智),
**held in place by stupidity** (*shǒu zhī yǐ yú—守之以愚).
This is in **harmony with the above**.
**Nurturing life and fostering growth** (*shēng zhī chù zhī—生之畜之) to this extent is called **mysterious virtue/power** (*huàndé—玄德).
The **Sage** preserves his **spirit** (*shén—神) and understands **transformations** (*huà—化),
uniting with the **Dao/Way** (*dào—道) in essence,
thus he **matches the divine clarity** (*pèi shén míng—配神明),
**nourishes all things** (*yù wànwù—育万物),
and **nothing is beyond his capacity** (*wú bùkě yǐ—无不可者).
He **nurtures life to fulfill its nature** (*shēng zhī yǐ suì qí xìng—生之以遂其性),
**fosters growth to perfect its nourishment** (*chù zhī yǐ jí qí yǎng—畜之以极其养),
yet **has no heart of partial love or self-interest** (*wú ài lì zhī xīn yān—无爱利之心焉).
Thus it is said: *"He nurtures yet does not possess"* (*shēng ér bù yǒu—生而不有).
**He acts yet does not rely on his deeds** (*wú jiān fá zhī xíng yān—无矜伐之行焉),
thus it is said: *"He acts yet does not claim"* (*wéi ér bù shì—为而不恃).
**He sustains yet does not slaughter** (*wú kè zhì zhī qiǎo yān—无刻制之巧焉),
thus it is said: *"He grows long yet does not butcher"* (*zhǎng ér bù zǎi—长而不宰).
If one is thus, his **virtue/power is profound and distant** (*dé shēn yǐ yuǎn yǐ—德深矣远矣),
**contrary to all things** (*yǔ wù fǎn yǐ—与物反矣),
thus it is said: *"This is called mysterious virtue/power"* (*yú shì wèi huàndé—故曰是谓玄德).

When the **Celestial Dao/Way** ascends to the **north** (*běi*—北),
it **distinguishes itself from all things** (*yú wù biàn—与物辩).
Yet **the mysterious** (*huáxiàn—玄者) is the **color of the Celestial** (*tiān zhī sè—天之色也).
The **Sage** in relation to the **Celestial Dao/Way** (*tiān dào—天道),
**descends to embody virtue/power** (*jiàng ér wéi dé—降而为德),
and **nothing short of the mysterious suffices to name it** (*fēi huáxiàn bùzú yǐ míng zhī—非玄不足以名之).
**Wang Anshi** (*wáng jièfǔ—王介甫) says:
*"**Carrying and stopping** (*zài yíng pò—载营魄).*
**Carrying** (*zài—载) is **riding** (*chéng—乘),
**stopping** (*yíng—营) is **restraining** (*zhǐ—止).*
As in the *Yijing* (*Yì—易)*: **‘**the lower **riding** (*xià chéng—下乘) **firmness** (*gāng—刚).**’
**Vital essence and *qi*** (*jīng qì—精气) become **things** (*wù—物),
**wandering spirits** (*yóu hún—游魂) manifest **changes** (*biàn—变).
**Spirits** (*hún—魂) are **yang** (*yáng—阳), thus they **always move** (*gāng dòng—常动).
**Souls** (*pò—魄) are **yin** (*yīn—阴), thus they **always remain still** (*gāng jìng—常静).
**Yin** is the **complement** (*pèi—配) of **yang**, yet also its **bane** (*zéi—贼).
**Spirits** are the **auxiliaries** (*fǔ—辅) of **souls**, yet also their **raiders** (*kòu—寇).
Only when the **spirit moves while the soul remains still** (*hún dòng ér pò gāng zhì—魂动而魄常止),
does it **allow the spirit to always carry the soul** (*shǐ hún gāng zài yú pò—故使魂常载於魄),
and **yang to always overcome yin** (*yáng gāng shèng yú yīn—则阳常胜於阴),
thus **preserving its Celestial integrity** (*quán qí tiān shǒu—则全其天守矣).
**Indeed, if the spirit can carry the soul** (*guī hún néng zài pò—盖魂能营魄),
and the **soul can carry the spirit without being carried by it** (*pò néng zài hún ér bù zài yú hún—魄能载魂而不载於魂),
then **it is the obstruction of desires and actions** (*yǒu wéi sìyù zhī yè hún—有为嗜欲之蔽魂),
**that, though present, leads to life’s beginning and death** (*suī zài ér yǒu shēngsǐ yǐ—虽在而有生始死矣).
**Embrace the One—can one truly be without separation?**
**The One** (*yī—一) is **vital essence** (*jīng—精).
When **spirit and soul are complete** (*hún pò jì zhù—魂魄既具), then **vital essence is born** (*jīng shēng—精生),
and when **vital essence is born, the spirit follows** (*shén cóng zhī—则神从之).
**Concentrating the breath and attaining supreme gentleness—can one truly be like the infant?**
**Intent** (*zhì—志) is the **leader** (*shuài—帅) of the breath** (*qì—气),
**breath** is the **steed of virtue/power** (*shì shàn è zhī mǎ—适善恶之马).
Where the **breath** directs, the **intent** compels it thus** (*qì zhī suǒ zuò, zhì shǐ zhī rán—气之所作，志使之然).
Now, **concentrating and guarding the breath within** (*zhuān shǒu qí qì yú nèi—专守其气於内),
and **attaining the utmost gentleness** (*zhì jí qí róu—而致极其柔).
Can one truly **be like the infant** (*néng rú yīng’ér—能如婴儿乎)?
This means **to be as gentle and weak as the infant** (*yán rú yīng’ér zhī róu ruò—言如婴儿之柔弱也).
The **infant** (*yīng’ér—婴儿) **cries all day yet does not grow hoarse** (*zhōng rì hào ér nǎi shì—终日号而乃嗌不嘎),
**gazes all day yet does not blink** (*zhōng rì shì ér bù shàng mù—终日视而不瞬目).
Mencius speaks of its **breath** (*qì—气), saying it is **supremely vast and firm** (*zhì dà zhì gāng—至大至刚),
**filling the space between Heaven and Earth** (*sài hú tiān dì zhī jiān—塞乎天地之间).
Yet Laozi speaks of **concentrating the breath and attaining gentleness** (*zhuān qì zhì róu—专气致柔),
why is this so?
Mencius **establishes the root** (*lì běn—立本),
Laozi **returns to the root** (*fǎn běn—反本),
thus their words differ.

**Washing away and illuminating mysterious insight—can one truly be without flaw?**
**Washing away** (*dí chú—涤除) is **cleansing the heart** (*xǐ xīn—洗心),
**illuminating** (*huáxiàn—玄览) is **observing the marvels** (*guān miào—观妙).
Like the **brightness of the moon** (*yuè zhī míng—月之明),
or the **luster of a pearl** (*zhū zhī yīng—珠之莹),
can one truly **be without flaw** (*néng wú cí—能无疵乎)?

**Love the people and govern the state—can one truly be without action?**
**Loving the people** (*ài mín—爱民) is **loving without attachment** (*wéi ài—以不爱),
**loving them thus makes love enduring** (*ài zhī nǎi cháng—爱之乃长).
**Governing the state** (*zhì guó—治国) is **governing without interference** (*wéi zhì—以不治),
**governing them thus makes governance enduring** (*zhì zhī nǎi cháng—治之乃长).
Only when one **loves without attachment yet loves** (*bù ài ér ài—不爱而爱),
and **governs without interference yet governs** (*bù zhì ér zhì—不治而治),
is it said: *"He is without action"* (*wúwéi—无为).
**The Sage who is without action** (*wúwéi—无为),
**employs the world’s actions** (*yòng tiānxià zhī yǒuwéi—用天下之有为);
**the one with abundance** (*yǒuyú—有余),
**employs the world’s insufficiency** (*yòng tiānxià zhī bùzú—用天下之不足).
Yet Laozi **speaks of returning to the root** (*fǎn běn—反本),
so why does he say *"love the people and govern the state"* (*ài mín zhì guó—爱民治国)?
**Indeed, Laozi speaks of returning to the root** (*fǎn běn—反本),
yet **proceeds from the Dao/Way itself to establish teachings** (*suì zì dào ér qǐ jiào—遂自道而起教),
**this is what is meant by sharing joy and sorrow with the people** (*suǒ wèi jí xiōng yǔ mín tóng huàn—所谓吉凶与民同患也).
The *Yijing* says:
*"The **Sage** uses this to **cleanse the heart** (*xǐ xīn—洗心),
**retreat and hide in seclusion** (*tuì cáng yú mì—退藏於密),
sharing joy and sorrow with the people is the same."* (*jí xiōng yǔ mín tóng huàn shì yě—吉凶与民同患是也).
Not only does Laozi speak thus,
**all ancient Sages** (*fán gǔ zhī shèngrén—凡古之圣人) **do likewise**.

**The Celestial Gate opens and shuts—can one truly be without yielding?**
**All things emerge and return through it** (*wànwù yóu shì ér chū, yóu shì ér rù—万物由是而出，由是而入),
thus it is called the **Celestial Gate** (*tiān mén—天门).
**Opening and shutting** (*kāi hé—开阖) **bring movement and stillness** (*yǒu dòng jìng—则有动静),
**movement and stillness bring yielding and force** (*yǒu dòng jìng zé yǒu cí xiōng—有动静则有雌雄).
Only when one **guards yielding to overcome force** (*shǒu cí yǐ shèng xiōng—守雌以胜雄),
and **guards stillness to overcome movement** (*shǒu jìng yǐ shèng dòng—守静以胜动),
is it said: *"The Celestial Gate opens and shuts—can one truly be without yielding?"* (*tiān mén kāi hé, néng wú cí—天门开阖，能无雌乎).

**Nurturing life and fostering growth.**
**Nurturing life** (*shēng zhī—生之) is the **Dao/Way** (*dào—道),
**fostering growth** (*chù zhī—畜之) is **virtue/power** (*dé—德).
This is called **mysterious virtue/power** (*huàndé—玄德).
The **Dao/Way within us** (*dào zhī zài wǒ—道之在我者),
is **virtue/power** (*dé—德).
**Nurturing yet not possessing** (*shēng ér bù yǒu—生而不有),
**acting yet not claiming** (*wéi ér bù shì—为而不恃),
**growing long yet not butchering** (*zhǎng ér bù zǎi—长而不宰),
this is called **mysterious virtue/power** (*huàndé—玄德).
**These three converge in non-self** (*sān zhě guī yú wú wǒ—三者归於无我),
thus it is called **mysterious virtue/power** (*huàndé—玄德).

**Su Yingshi** (*sū yǐngbīn—苏颖滨) says:
*"**Carrying and stopping the soul** (*zài yíng pò—载营魄),
**embracing the One—can one truly be without separation?**
The **soul’s distinction from the spirit** (*

The ears and eyes are weary from sounds and colors,
the nose and mouth labor over scents and flavors.
When the **soul** (*pò—魄*) moves as it wills and the **spirit** (*shén—神*) follows,
then the **soul bears the spirit** (*shén cháng zài pò—神常载魄*).

Thus, one is taught to **embrace the spirit and bear the soul** (*bào shén zài pò—抱神载魄*), so that the two never part—
this is indeed the **Dao/Way** by which the **sages cultivate the self** (*shèngrén suǒyǐ xiūshēn zhī yào—圣人所以修身之要*).
As for the **ancient True Ones** (*gǔ zhēnrén—古之真人*), deeply rooted and firmly established,
long-lived and enduring in vision—
their **Dao/Way** also arises from this.

Can one **focus the qi and attain softness** (*zhuāng qì zhì róu—专气致柔*) like an infant?
If the **spirit** (*shén—神*) is not governed, the **qi** (*qì—气*) is disordered—
the strong delight in excess, the weak delight in fear,
yet they know it not.
When the **spirit** is governed, the **qi** does not act wantonly—
joy and anger follow their kind—
this is called **focusing the qi** (*zhuāng qì—专气*).
When **spirit is utterly empty** (*shén xū zhī zhì—神虚之至*), **qi is truly substantial** (*qì shí zhī shǐ—气实之始*).
The utmost emptiness is softness, the utmost substance is hardness—
to preserve purity of nature and lose the **qi** is called **attaining softness** (*zhì róu—致柔*).
An infant knows no likes or dislikes—
thus its nature is whole.
When nature is whole, the **qi** is subtle,
and when the **qi** is subtle, the body is soft.
To **focus the qi and attain softness** (*zhuāng qì zhì róu—专气致柔*) is to reach the extreme of an infant.

Can one **purify and perceive the mysterious** (*xǐchú xuànlǎn—涤除玄览*) without flaw?
The **sage**, neither borne by the **soul** externally nor ruled by the **qi** internally,
thus purges all dust and filth—
and so the **spirit** becomes vast and clear.
Gazing upon all things in their **mystery** (*xuàn—玄*), knowing they all arise from nature,
equally observing purity and defilement without blemish—

Can one **love the people and govern the state** (*ài mín zhì guó—爱民治国*) without action?
Having cultivated the self, extending this further to others—
even in loving the people and governing the state,
one meets them with **non-action** (*wúxīn—无心*).
If there is **intent** (*xīn—心*), then those who love the people harm them,
and those who govern the state disrupt them.

Can one **open and close the Heavenly Gate** (*tiānmén kāihé—天门开阖*) without yielding?
The **Heavenly Gate** (*tiānmén—天门*) is the source of order and chaos, rise and decline.
Having taken the self to bear the world,
when the opening and closing, the gathering and scattering occur,
the common folk value virtue yet fear loss—
they act in advance to court fortune.
The **sage** follows principle and knows the **Heavenly Command** (*tiānmìng—天命*), thus waits for the lead before responding.
The *Yijing* says:
*"To act before Heaven is to meet Heaven’s resistance—
yet this is not to act before Heaven;
to act after Heaven is to follow Heaven’s time—
yet this is not to act after Heaven."*
It speaks only of acting neither too early nor too late,
always aligning with **Heavenly Command** (*tiānmìng—天命*).
Otherwise, acting too soon will fail,
acting too late will also fail.
Thus, the one who can **yield** (*cí—雌*) does not lose the time.

Can one be **clear and far-reaching** (*míngbái sìdá—明白四达*) without knowing?
Cultivating the self internally, governing the state externally—
when facing change, all is guided by **Dao/Way** (*dào—道*).
Is this not the work of one who is **clear and far-reaching** (*míngbái sìdá—明白四达*)?
**Clarity and reach** (*míngbái sìdá—明白四达*) is the **heart** (*xīn—心*).
This **heart** knows nothing yet knows all—
yet it never harbors a knowing mind.
The **heart** is one—
if another knowing arises, then it is two.
From one to two, the source of obstruction is born,
and the origin of folly begins.
Now, when objects approach a mirror,
it responds—
yet how can one say the mirror *knows* what it reflects?
The root is without knowing,
yet the mind imposes it—
this is the source of delusion.

**Fostering growth** (*chù zhī—畜之*) and **generating life** (*shēng zhī—生之*)—
this is called **mysterious virtue/power** (*huàndé—玄德*).
Its **Dao/Way**, sufficient to **foster growth** and **generate life** for all things,
yet it does not possess, does not rely, does not butcher—
though it has great virtue/power,
yet none know it.
Thus it is called **mysterious virtue/power** (*huàndé—玄德*).

**Lǚ Jìfǔ** (*lǚ jìfǔ—吕吉甫*) says:
*"To bear the soul and spirit* (*zài yíng pò—载营魄*).
For long has humanity possessed its body,
yet to retreat from it, to embody the **Dao/Way of Heaven** (*tiāndào—天道*)
without the burden of fame and gain—
is this not difficult?
Yet there is a **Dao/Way** to it.
At the beginning of life, it is called **soul** (*pò—魄*).
When **soul** and **essence** (*jīng—精*) are one,
it is still and complete.
Once the **soul** is born, the **spirit** (*hún—魂*) is yang.
The **spirit** and **spirit** (*shén—神*) move in exchange,
while the **soul** and **essence** enter and exit—
then the **soul** is scattered and does not **bear** (*zài—载*), separated and does not **embrace** (*bào—抱*).

**Bearing** (*zài—载*) means the cycle of end and beginning;
**embracing** (*yíng—营*) means encircling without gap.
Can one **embrace the One** (*bào yī—抱一*) without separation?
Though already a person,
if one bears the **soul and spirit** and embraces the One,
tranquilly without action,
like the beginning of life’s transformation—
then one can truly separate.

Can one **focus the qi and attain softness** (*zhuāng qì zhì róu—专气致柔*) like an infant?
To be without separation is to focus the **qi** without division,
to attain softness without resistance—
thus one can be like an infant.

Can one **purify and perceive the mysterious** (*xǐchú xuànlǎn—涤除玄览*) without flaw?
To be like an infant is to purge regret and stinginess,
to gaze upon the subtle mysteries—
every subtle movement that disturbs me,
I must know it—
and thus be without flaw.

Can one **open and close the Heavenly Gate** (*tiānmén kāihé—天门开阖*) without yielding?
Internally, to purify and perceive the mysterious without flaw,
externally, to love the people and govern the state without action—
then the **Heavenly Gate** will be within me,
and I can truly yield.

Can one be **clear and far-reaching** (*míngbái sìdá—明白四达*) without knowing?
Not pushing, not welcoming, responding yet not hoarding—
then one is **clear and far-reaching**,
and can truly be without knowing.
When **Dao/Way** reaches **non-knowing** (*wúzhī—无知*), then it is true knowing.
Thus, to be human yet embody Heaven—
what burden of fame and gain remains?
This is called **mysterious virtue/power** (*huàndé—玄德*).

**Fostering growth** (*chù zhī—畜之*) and **generating life** (*shēng zhī—生之*), yet not possessing,
acting yet not relying, growing long yet not butchering—
this is its true nature.
**Mysterious virtue/power** (*huàndé—玄德*) is none other than **Heavenly virtue/power** (*tiāndé—天德*).

**Lù Nóngshī** (*lù nóngshī—陆农师*) says:
*"To bear the soul and spirit* (*zài yíng pò—载营魄*).
The **spirit** (*hún—魂*) is yang, yang is movement.
The **soul** (*pò—魄*) is yin, yin is stillness.
The **soul** is the **spirit’s** assistant—
its movement has change yet no transformation.
The **soul** is **essence’s** support—
its stillness has transformation yet no change.
Thus, the **spirit** is spoken of as **wandering** (*yóu—游*), the **soul** as **bearing** (*yíng—营*).
**Wandering spirit** (*yóu hún—游魂*) speaks to its change,
**bearing soul** (*yíng pò—营魄*) speaks to its stillness.
Can one be without separation?
To **bear the soul and spirit** (*zài yíng pò—载营魄*) is to govern externally;
to **embrace the One** (*bào yī—抱一*) is to guard internally.
Thus it is said: *"To bear the soul and spirit, embrace the One—
can one be without separation?"*
To **bear the soul** (*zài pò—载魄*) is to achieve movement,
to **embrace the One** (*bào yī—抱一*) is to achieve stillness—
and internally and externally, they are always united without separation.
Only then can one **focus the qi and attain softness** (*zhuāng qì zhì róu—专气致柔*), like an infant.

To focus the qi and attain softness—can one be like an infant?
Indeed, internal guarding is how the qi is made focused,
external movement is how the qi is made soft.
When guarding is focused and movement is soft,
and one’s virtue compares to that of an infant,
then one’s mind can be cleansed and refined,
its spirit washed and illuminated in Heaven.
All dharmas are empty, yet none burden with their weight.
Thus it is said: *"To focus the qi and attain softness—can one be like an infant?"*
And then to purify and perceive the Mysterious—can one be without flaw?

To purify and perceive the Mysterious—can one be without flaw?
Purification speaks of washing the heart,
removal speaks of excavating the heart.
Wash it, and nothing remains unclean;
excavate it, and nothing remains unempty.
Transcendent and observing, all dharmas are empty—
then one can establish laws from emptiness,
and share with the people the joys and calamities of fate.
Thus it is said: *"To purify and perceive the Mysterious—can one be without flaw?"*

To love the people and govern the state—can one act without action?
Toward the people, one loves them by not loving them;
in governing the state, one rules by not ruling.
The Dao accomplishes all without doing—
then one can remain motionless and still,
responding naturally to the workings of Heaven and Earth.
Thus one acts only when unavoidable,
responds only when sought—
and so it is said: *"To love the people and govern the state—can one act without action?"*
And then to open and close the Heavenly Gate—can one be without duality?

The Heavenly Gate—can one be without duality?
The Heavenly Gate is the void.
Spirit and qi flow in and out,
opening and closing in unity—
all things emerge from here, return to here,
and their transformations are boundless.
The Heavenly Gate, opening and closing with all things,
yet without duality—
then one can attain round enlightenment, universally illuminating,
greatly communicating the four directions,
penetrating to the utmost without obstruction,
reaching the profound without awareness.
Thus it is said: *"To open and close the Heavenly Gate—can one be without duality?"*
And then to be clear and all-pervading—can one be without knowing?

To be clear and all-pervading—can one be without knowing?
To bear the soul and embrace the One—can one be without separation?
To love the people and govern the state—can one act without action?
This is the Sage.

To open and close the Heavenly Gate—can one be without duality?
To be clear and penetrating—can one be without knowing?
This is the Divine Person.

Master Lu Nong said:
To bear the soul—
the soul is yin, the master of form.
The spirit, vast and all-pervading yet unaware of itself,
ordinarily abides in the soul,
and thus the spirit becomes constrained by the body.
The expansive becomes confined,
the fluid becomes stagnant.
Those who study this Way must first broaden their will and qi,
not burdened by the body,
so that the spirit abides in the soul and not the soul.
Then one can embrace the One and embody the spirit.

I have often reasoned:
When a person dies, there are differences in ascent and descent—
truly because the spirit perishes to serve the form,
following the soul, descending into darkness and transforming into other things.
But for those whose spirit is complete,
even if the soul is stagnant in yin,
the essence and spirit unite as one,
and nothing can hinder them.
The Sage’s death is said to be *"the spirit not following the soul."*
At first, even the Sage bears the soul alone.
To embrace the One—
the One is the number of essence;
though not called essence, to guard the One is to keep essence steady.
Can one be without separation?

Learning the Way returns to restoring nature,
restoring nature returns to embodying the spirit.
What prevents one from embodying the spirit
is pursuing externals while forgetting the root,
exchanging the self for things.
Thus, losing essence and failing in spirit,
one sinks into base stupidity.

The vital essences of yin and yang are soul and spirit.
The soul is yang and wanders,
while what anchors the body is the soul’s counterpart—
the soul is yin and stills.
Thus, the student must first calm their will and qi,
so that essence and soul are tranquil and unified.
When the soul is still, the spirit settles;
when essence is unified, the spirit is complete.

Life is born from water—water is essence.
At birth, essence gathers the spirit.
Originally whole yet unaware,
it often scatters and dissipates—
this is called *wangliang* (the two shadows).
*Wang* means the spirit is unclear,
*liang* means essence is not unified.
Zhuangzi said: *"Do not shake your essence—*
this is called embracing the One."*

The spirit and qi are the symbols of fire and water.
Fire has no fixed form;
when essence shines, the spirit becomes boundless and formless,
unable to be constrained by kings—
only preserve essence.
Like adding oil to make fire bright,
nurturing roots to make leaves flourish.
When soul, spirit, and essence are undiminished,
then the heart is strong and qi flows smoothly,
uncontrolled by things.
Stillness embodies the Dao,
action aligns with principle—
refined to the utmost,
the spirit becomes One,
transcending the four names.
This is the ultimate subtlety of the student—
all ages of sages and worthies follow this truth.
Seeking lies not outside;
it must be attained by the heart.

To focus the qi and attain softness—can one be like an infant?
Human life has three aspects: essence, spirit, and qi.
When essence is complete, the spirit reigns;
when the spirit reigns, it can command the qi.
If the spirit weakens and cannot command the qi,
then the spirit’s movements are erratic,
leading one astray from the Way.
Mencius said: *"The will is the commander of qi."*
Yang Xiong said: *"Qi is the horse that carries one to good or evil.
If the teacher is weak and the troops rebellious, the teacher will perish;
if the horse rages and the driver is exhausted, the chariot will fail."*
When the spirit cannot focus the qi,
joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise from qi,
driving one into chaos—
this is the natural order.
Ancient scholars all understood this.
If one has not yet attained this,
they must first purify the heart to guard against it.
The three warnings of Confucius are all about guarding the qi.
Among his disciples, only Yan Hui could focus the qi,
thus it is said: *"He did not transfer his anger."*
Qi’s violence manifests in yang,
and nothing is more violent than anger in yang.
If one can avoid transferring anger,
what else is this but focusing the qi?

Human beings are originally endowed with sage nature,
but when qi dissipates and cannot be focused,
it is said: *"As one grows older, one drifts further from the Way."*

「To embrace *Oneness* (抱一), the spirit becomes sovereign (神王).
When the spirit is sovereign, the qi becomes gentle (气柔),
and when the qi is gentle, the *Essence* (真) is preserved.

The reason one can align with an infant’s focused concentration (同专者),
is that they possess the power without claiming authority (有而擅其权之谓).

Can one purify and perceive the *Mysterious* (玄) without flaw (疵)?
This is the art of focusing the qi—
when the qi is focused, the nature becomes settled (性定),
and when the nature is settled, wisdom becomes clear (智明).
With wisdom clear, one can then wash away impurities (荡涤除去)
and attain the *Mysterious Vision* (玄览) of utmost subtlety (至妙).
Having illuminated its principle (烛其理),
all phenomena in the world become the same as this utmost subtlety.
If one still perceives any flaw (观一疵),
then one does not yet recognize the principle (非识理也).

To love the people and govern the state (爱民治国),
can one truly act without doing (无为)?
As explained above, the Way for oneself is complete (为己之道尽矣).
Thus, one can extend its remainder to others (及人也).

The Master Laozi’s teaching is focused on restoring one’s nature (复性).
To act with doing (有为) is not the means to let the people dwell in their true nature (安性).
Thus, though he loves governance (爱治),
he does not uphold doing (不尚有为)—
this is the ultimate Dao (此道之至也).

The opening and closing of the *Heavenly Gate* (天门),
can one truly act without *feminine* (雌)?
The Sage has no intent to act (无心於作),
but their spirit enters and exits in response (精神出入皆应)
without any artificial display (不唱).
This is what Zhuangzi called *"the one who receives the essence of things"* (有物采之者),
and Laozi, in the season of autumn (四时当秋),
when his *virtue/power* (德) generates *Metal* (金),
was the master of stillness and restoring *Oneness* (静一复性者也).
Hence, his teachings emphasize this.

As for the *Yijing* (《易》),
both the *Primordial* (先天) and *Subsequent* (后天) are nothing but the Dao (无非道者).
To be *illuminated and expansive in all directions* (明白四达),
is one not to be without knowing (无知)?
The principle is beyond knowing (理无足知).
Knowing is merely the response to things (知以应物).
Once one knows the ultimate principle (既知至理),
they naturally remain in constant *non-knowing* (自常无知).
Only through *non-knowing* can one truly know all (无所不知).
If one were to claim knowing (昭然有知),
then one is truly without knowing (是不知).
The subtlety of *non-knowing* (无知之妙),
how could it be called knowing (何足谓知也)?

Examining this thoroughly (切尝论之),
whether one is a Sage or a fool (圣智下愚),
they originally share no distinction (本无殊品).
It is only through foolishness that wisdom becomes apparent (因愚显智),
and thus the name of Sage arises (乃有圣名).
The Sage’s original heart (本心),
has never been inherently Sage (何尝自圣).
Hence, *illuminated and expansive in all directions* (明白四达)
while initially knowing nothing (初无所知),
is the Sage’s true knowing (乃圣人之知也).

To nurture and sustain life (生之畜之).
The Dao is complete as said above (道备如上),
so that *creation and transformation* (造化) lie within oneself (在我),
and one can nurture and sustain all things (可以生畜万物矣).

To give birth without possession (生而不有).
The Dao generates all things (道生万物),
and things are always one with the Dao (物之与道常为一体).
Who could claim to possess them?

To act without reliance (为而不恃).
When forced to act (不得已而为之),
even if one performs deeds (於已然之时),
their essence transcends and self-destroys (虽有为为之功，而超然自丧),
how could they still boast or err (岂复矜哉)?
To extend without slaughtering (长而不宰).
The Dao, as explained above (如上文),
can lengthen and sustain all under Heaven without doing (可以长天下以无为矣).
Though it stands above things like a *flagpole* (标枝),
how could it have the power of division (岂有分割之功乎)?
This is called *Mysterious Virtue* (玄德).
*Mysterious* (玄) refers to the subtle essence (妙体),
and *virtue* (德) is the ultimate (至也).
In ancient times, Shun dwelled in *Mysterious Virtue* (侧微，《书》称玄德).
Truly, the ultimate *virtue/power* (至德) is always found
in *non-thinking and non-doing* (无思无为).
This chapter’s meaning centers on *non-doing* (主於无为).
Thus, though it speaks of extending (为长),
its *virtue/power* is especially called *Mysterious* (德尤称玄).

This chapter, from the scholar (士) to attaining
the *entry of spirit into Sagehood* (体神入圣),
has fully exhausted the sequence of self-cultivation (修身之序尽矣).

Liu Zhongping said:
Embrace *Oneness* (抱一).
*Concentrate oneness* (致一) is the essence of its meaning (所以精义),
embrace *Oneness* (抱一) is the means to respond to changes (所以应变),
and *return to Oneness* (反一) is the way to enter the spirit (所以入神).
Thus, the *Way* of the gentleman begins with *concentrating oneness* (致一),
is applied through *embracing Oneness* (抱一),
and is hidden in *returning to Oneness* (反一).

Can one focus the qi and govern with gentleness (专气政柔),
like an infant (婴儿)?
When humans are born, in infancy the qi is focused and *Oneness* is concentrated (致一),
reaching the utmost of *Essence* (真).
As they grow older, emotions arise (情生),
reaching the utmost of *artifice* (伪).
Only those who understand the Dao (知道者),
when they seek fame (营名), lose their *Essence* (真),
and when they seek profit (为利), drift into *artifice* (伪).
This is called the ability to restore (能复者也).

The opening and closing of the *Heavenly Gate* (天门),
can one truly act without *feminine* (雌)?
Opening and closing (开阖) are the applications of transformation (变化之用).
The *Yijing* says:
*"Qian* (乾) employs *beauty* (美) and *advantage* (利) to benefit all under Heaven,
but does not speak of what it benefits—
great indeed!" (不言所利，大矣哉).
This means the *Qian* (乾) Dao employs *greatness* (大) as its function (为用).
If one transforms by the *Qian* Dao,
they also employ *greatness* in their function (用乎大).
To guard its *feminine* (守其雌) is merely to say,
"I am what I naturally protect" (盖言吾所自守云耳).
If one can guard its *feminine*,
then their function must surely be *great* (其用也必大).

To be *illuminated and expansive in all directions* (明白四达),
can one truly be without knowing (无知)?
If one strives to be *illuminated and expansive in all directions* (明白四达)
while anxiously attending to maintaining harmony (汲汲乎以事平和),
is this not small (不亦小乎)?
Thus, there is knowing that is small (有知小)
and there is knowing through *non-knowing* (无知之知).

Liu Jiji said:
To *carry and sustain* (载) the *vital energies and spirit* (营魄).
When humans are born, the *yang* energies (诸阳) are the *hun* (魂),
and the *yin* energies (诸阴) are the *po* (魄).
Each has its name and form (名象),
and is stored between the liver and lungs (藏於肝肺之间).
The lesser scholar knows of them (下士知之),
while the greater scholar perceives them (上士见之).
The *Essence* (精) and *spirit* (神) rely on one another to generate life (相依以生),
and together, the *Essence* entering and exiting (并精出入),
is the *po* (魄).
The *hun* (魂) is what comes and goes with the *spirit* (神).
This chapter speaks of *carrying and sustaining* (载营魄),
and *camp* (营) is the same as *hun* (魂).
The Yellow Emperor said:
*"To move and sustain the body is called the *hun* (动以营身，谓之魂)."*
The *Yijing* says:
*"A wandering *hun* (游魂) is transformation,"*
and Zhuangzi said:
*"Its *hun* (魂) does not grow weary,"*
all referring to *hun* (魂),
which governs movement and action (主经营动作),
serving as the vital function of the body (为一身之运).
As for the *po* (魄),
it is the *Essence* entering and exiting (并精出入),
and nothing but the generation and transformation of life (生化成变).

Now, the hundred bones and nine orifices (百骸九窍)
composing one’s form (具吾形),
are all the *po* (魄)'s domain (魄之属也).
If not for the *po* (魄) to sustain them (以营之),
what would distinguish them from a *walking corpse* (行尸)?

The *po* (魄) cannot exist without the *hun* (魂),
just as the moon cannot exist without the sun (犹月不可以无日).
The *po* (魄) depends on the *hun* (魂) to form *camp* (营),
and the moon depends on the sun to generate light (月待日而生光).
Here, it speaks of the *hun*’s function (魂之用) as *camp* (营),
and the *po*’s essence (魄之体) as *po* (魄).

*Carry* (载) means to bear with form (以形载).
Form is like a *chariot* (车).
The *po* (魄) and *hun* (魂) are the *chariot*’s accumulation (车之积).
In the world, there are those who carry the *hun* (魂) but not the *po* (魄),
those who carry the *po* (魄) but not the *hun* (魂),
and those who carry both *hun* and *po* (魂魄两载).

To carry the *hun* without the *po* is the greater scholar (上士).
To carry the *po* without the *hun* is the lesser scholar (下士).
To carry both is the middle scholar (中士).
The greater scholar preserves their *yang* purity and ascends as a *transcendent* (浮仙),
the lesser scholar is impure and sinks into the *ghostly* (沉鬼),
while the middle scholar cultivates their form (修其形).

Can one embrace *Oneness* without separation (抱一能无离)?
To carry and sustain the *vital energies and spirit* (载营魄),
their practice lies solely in embracing *Oneness* (抱一).
The Dao generates *Oneness* (道生一),
*Oneness* generates *Water* (一生水),
*Water* generates *Essence* (水生精),
and *Essence* is the substance of *Oneness* (精者一之物).
To embrace *Oneness* is to unite with *Essence* (与精合),
while to abandon *Oneness* is to separate from *Essence* (脱一则与精离矣).」

When *Essence* is complete, *qi* is whole, and when *qi* is whole, *spirit* is whole—
with *spirit* whole, one may govern the *hun* (soul),
and thus the *po* (ethereal soul) belongs to the greater scholar.

For *Essence* is the source by which Heaven and Earth, all things, are born and formed.
Yet *Essence* is ever stingy to man, while man ever wastes it—
leaking through orifices without measure,
until the *yin* is exhausted and death ensues—
then it is said that *Essence* has departed.
But it is not that *Essence* has truly departed—
rather, man himself has caused its separation.

Zhuangzi said: *"Not to depart from Essence is called a Divine Person."*
Thus it is said: *"Can one truly not depart?"*

Can one focus *qi* and attain supreme softness?
To focus *qi* means *qi* is not dispersed;
to attain softness means to reach utmost harmony—
this is the natural state of an infant.
If one who cultivates the Dao can be thus,
then *qi* will be whole.

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"The origin of *born qi* is the root of the Twelve Meridians—*
that which stirs between the kidneys.
For all that enters and exits through the nose and mouth,
all movements of the hands and feet,
are nourished by the Five Grains, supplemented by the Five Livestock,
assisted by the Five Fruits, filled by the Five Vegetables,
moistened by wine and rice wine,
and balanced by fragrant herbs and medicinal stones—
harmonized and refined, they enter the meridians as *honor* (nutritive *qi*),
smooth and swift, circulating to defend the skin—
all are but the secondary functions of *born qi*,
while its source is guarded between the kidneys,
from which the myriad three thousand five hundred breaths arise.

When this *qi* flows into knowledge and desire,
it becomes unfocused and loses its softness,
while joy, anger, sorrow, and delight manifest within,
and youth, vigor, aging, and death manifest without—
a seven-foot frame, yet but as dung and soil.

An infant, unaware of male and female union,
has *qi* that may be called focused.
To wail all day without hoarseness—
its harmony is extreme.

Man is born with *commission* (and *response*) in harmony,
yet what causes discord is failing to focus *qi* and instead acting violently.

Thus, the subtle principle of preserving whole *qi* is as follows:
*"The Perfect Man does not lose the heart of an infant."*

Can one purify and gaze into the profound without blemish?
The heart harbors *spirit*—
the heart is like a mirror,
*spirit* like a valley.
To exhaust the principles of the world in a single illumination—
that is the heart alone.

Yet those who can illuminate with *spirit* must delve deeply,
for their darkness is profound and their vision distant—
thus it is called *profound gazing*.
The heart is inherently profound and gazing,
yet what defiles it, making it unclear?
What obstructs it, making it unvast?
Only when one cannot master things does *Essence* depart,
*qi* weaken, and *spirit* leave—
when *spirit* departs, one falls into darkness and faintness,
for all things are defiled, all things are obstructed.

As when a man walks at night and sees nothing—
this is his clarity,
yet it is self-purified;
this is his vastness,
yet it is self-emptied.

Thus, the ailments of *profound gazing* do not come from without.
Only the Sage can illuminate without purification—
this is not a matter of cultivating the Dao.
As Zhuangzi said: *"To reach it is to enter its blemish."*

This chapter takes preserving whole *Essence*, whole *qi*, and whole *spirit*
as the root of cultivating the Dao.
Thus, *"not departing"* speaks to nurturing *Essence*,
*"like an infant"* speaks to nurturing *qi*,
and *"without blemish"* speaks to nurturing *spirit*.

To love the people and govern the state—
can one act without doing?
Zhuangzi said: *"The true Dao governs the body,
its remnants govern the state."*
To love the people is *ren* (benevolence).
To govern the state is *zheng* (administration).
The affairs of kings and lords cannot avoid action,
yet if viewed as straw dogs,
they may be attained.

Can the *Heavenly Gate* open and close without distinction?
He who accomplishes affairs must follow the Dao of Heaven—
thus this speaks of the *Heavenly Gate*.
Zhuangzi said: *"The Heavenly Gate has no existence.
All things arise from non-existence."*
The *Yijing* says: *"One closing, one opening, is called *change*."*
For the Dao of Heaven governs *change*—
to love the people and govern the state
is to follow Heaven alone.
Why seek to act like a male?
If unavoidable, then respond—but no more.

To be clear and all-reaching—
can one know without knowing?
*Clarity* is knowing;
*all-reaching* is knowing without knowing.
If one knows both self and others,
then one may be said to know without knowing.
Not retreating into secrecy—
if one can know without knowing while containing wisdom,
then *hun* and *po* may fear they have no vessel,
and *spirit*, *qi*, and *Essence* may fear they cannot be preserved—
perhaps then one may attain two hundred years without decay of form.

To give birth and to nurture—
*giving birth* is the Dao,
*nurturing* is *virtue*.
As spoken above, this is not for those who do not embody *Dao* and *virtue*.

To give birth without possessing—
I give birth to it, yet do not possess it;
not possessing it, then my giving birth is not my possession.
To act without relying—
if one gives birth without acting, the principle of life is severed;
though one acts, if one relies upon it, one loses what was done.
To grow without controlling—
I give birth to it, I act upon it—
this is enough to nourish all things.
Without me, there is supreme nurturing—
this is called *profound virtue*.
To call *profound* a *virtue*—
how could one possess, rely, or control it?
To not possess, not rely, not control—
thus it is called the *Dao*.
Once action is complete, the *Dao* descends as *virtue*—
thus it is called *profound virtue*.
*Profound virtue* is what, above, encompasses the *Dao*.

The previous chapter spoke of withdrawing from worldly affairs,
yet sought closeness to the body—
thus next comes *carrying the vital energies and spirit*.
Liu Ji said: *"From carrying the vital energies and spirit to this is called profound virtue."*

The *hun* is a *yang* thing,
the *po* is a *yin* thing.
One *yin* and one *yang*—this is the *Dao*;
excess *yin* or excess *yang*—this is illness.
*Yin* is the complement of *yang*, yet also its bane—
thus the *hun* carries the *po* and nurtures it,
so that *yin* and *yang* may harmonize,
neither harming the other, and *virtue* returns to them.
Yet is there another way?
It is simply *Oneness* that governs it.

*Oneness* is a thing not two—
its generation of things is unfathomable,
neither *yin* nor *yang*,
yet not separate from *yin* and *yang*—
it can harmonize *yin* and *yang*.
Thus, to carry the vital energies and spirit while embracing *Oneness*—
can one truly not depart?

The Sage embraces *Oneness* without departing,
the heart containing nothing—
within the boundless and boundless,
*spirit* is guarded;
within the dim and dim,
*spirit* is naturally true.

---

Cultivate the *qi* without admixture,
nurture softness without violence—
thus one is like an infant.

An infant in its cradle knows not what to do,
walks without knowing where it goes,
all day gazes yet its eyes never blink,
all day cries yet its throat never grows hoarse—
this is the utmost harmony.

The Sage washes his heart with this,
retires and hides within the profound,
thus purging all thoughts,
and perceiving the subtle and wondrous *Dao*—
what flaw could remain?

This is Laozi’s teaching of returning to the origin,
followed by loving the people and governing the state—
why so?

Because the body is a microcosm of the state.
The Sage takes the heart as sovereign,
the body as the realm,
*qi* as the people—
thus, *wuwei* is the way to honor the sovereign.

When the heart practices *wuwei*, it is exalted above all,
and the myriad *qi* move spontaneously,
the hundred limbs govern themselves.
Preserving *qi* is how one loves the people,
nurturing the form is how one governs the state.

In *wuwei*, one governs the world with abundance;
in *youwei*, one serves the world yet lacks sufficiency.
Thus, to love the people and govern the state—
how could one not practice *wuwei*?

*Wuwei* means *wuwei*—yet nothing remains undone.
The Heavenly Gate opens of its own accord,
the Earthly Gate closes itself.
The Heavenly Gate is where spirit enters and departs.
When the Heavenly Gate opens and shuts,
the spirit can move freely,
sitting in one place yet wandering boundless realms.

Yet if the spirit wanders without restraint,
there are places it cannot reach—
thus, it must be still,
and align with *yin*’s virtue.

When the primal spirit is still,
true nature shines forth,
capable of mirroring Heaven and Earth,
illuminating the ten thousand things.

Yet if wisdom is overused,
it will falter at times.
Thus, clarity and openness—
how could one not embrace *wu*?

What is called "clever, enlightened, and wise"
is guarded by *yū* (primordial stupor).

Wisdom unused is true—
stillness and tranquility nourish each other,
knowing and serenity cultivate one another,
aligning with Heaven and Earth in essence,
matching Creation in function—
its *Dao* can generate the ten thousand things,
its *virtue* can nourish the world.

Thus it is said: *"To generate and to nourish."*
To generate without claiming the deed,
to act without relying on action,
to foster without ruling—
this is the *Classic*’s teaching:
*"Its achievements cover the world yet seem not its own,
its transformations benefit all things yet the people do not depend on them."*

Zhao Shizhan says:
At the outset, the root principle:
*"Gold and Fire seize the form."*
Then comes *"loading the *hun* and *po*."*
Recognizing the limits of Heaven’s timing,
knowing the impermanence of external things—
discarding the former, taking the latter—
thus lies the *Dao* of longevity.

Hence, it continues with *"loading the *hun* and *po*."*

The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"Establish Heaven’s *Dao*—*yin* and *yang*.*
*Yin* and *yang* are things that seek each other."

The spirit of one’s body is called *hun* and *po*;
*hun* and *po* are the *Dao* of mutual exchange.
*Hun* is *yang*, *po* is *yin*;
*po* draws from *yang* to manifest,
*hun* depends on *po* to stand.
When *hun* is full, *po* is born;
when *hun* fades, *po* retreats.
This is the rhythm of the sun and moon’s passage,
the ebb and flow of *yin* and *yang*—
Heaven’s eternal order.

The *Book of Documents* says: *"Zāi, the birth of *po*—*
this is the moon.
It shines bright in the east,
and *zāi* (wanes) in the west—
meaning a month of thirty days,
the numbers five and six.
Three days before the waning,
three days before the new—
subtracting six days.
The upper and lower crescents—
four and six, twenty-four.
The six days before and after—
totaling thirty days.

From its birth to the upper crescent,
gradually full—this is *hun*.
From the sixteenth day, turning to the *xùn* position,
gradually waning—this is *po*.
As it nears the waning, *po* vanishes.
At this time, the Great *Yin* is in *gèn*,
and aligns with the sun’s *qi*.
*Zhèn* arrives to receive the talisman,
refining the born *po*—
until three days pass,
when *zāi* is born in *gēng*’s earth.
This is *"loading the *hun* and *po*."*

Though called *po*,
in truth it is *hun*.
For it has substance, substance coming from *yang*.
Now called *po*—
the moon belongs to Metal,
Metal governs the lungs,
the lungs govern *po*—
speaking of its form, it is called *po*.

When it shines bright in the west and gazes east,
this is Metal overcoming Fire.
The east is Wood,
Wood governs *Zhèn*,
Wood generates Fire,
Fire is *yang*.
Wood is the liver,
the liver is *yin* within *yang*,
the liver governs *hun*—*yang*.
*Yang* belongs to Fire—
thus Metal seizes Fire to take form.

From the third day to the full moon,
*po* within *hun* is full—
now possessing the *Qián* body.
The six positions of *Qián* are all called *jiǔ*—
*nine*, the ultimate *yang*.
*Yang* is Fire.
When the moon is full,
it possesses the *Qián* body.
Metal seizing Fire’s form—
this is the four *jiǔ* generating Metal.
*Nine* resides in the *Lí* position,
empty to symbolize the moon—
thus *Lí* is the "central maiden,"
the maiden symbolizing *yin*.

Again, *Zhèn* receives the *gēng* talisman—
the *Kūn* of the west transforms into *Zhèn*.
Three days mark the initial *jiǔ*.
On the eighth day, *xīn* emerges—
a second transformation into *Duì*—
now the *jiǔ* of the second position.
By the tenth day, the *Qián* body is complete,
filling the east with *jiǎ*.
*Qián* governs the six *jiǎ*,
the Flying Dragon in Heaven.
The third position of *jiǔ*—
this is the waxing and waning of *yin* and *yang* seen in the moon.
A month of thirty days,
three hundred sixty moments—
matching the year’s count.

Refining the elixir must first attend to the Fire’s timing—
Fire can be drawn from Heaven,
thus the trigrams are Heaven’s talismans.
The *Fire Record* takes the *Classic of Changes* as its standard:
sixty-four trigrams, excluding *Qián*, *Kūn*, *Kǎn*, and *Lí*—
only sixty remain.
*Lún* at dawn, *Méng* at dusk mark the beginning;
fifteen days advance to *Dà Zhàng*’s end.
Fifteen days retreat from *Jìn* to *Wèi Jì*’s end.
The Fire’s timing advances and retreats,
the *qi*’s shifts follow the day—
seen in the moon’s waxing and waning.
When the upper crescent comes, advance;
when the lower crescent comes, retreat.

The *Classic* speaks of *"loading the *hun* and *po*"*—
this is the Tiger and Dragon’s union,
the infant and maiden seizing the spirit,
refining into *yù yè* (jade fluid).
The medicine’s sprout is fresh,
the initial *jiǔ* advances the Fire.
A time to guard with care—
no deviation allowed.

Thus, *"embracing Oneness"*—
to abandon it is to lose,
to neglect it is to die.

「Thus, when the foundation is firmly established and cannot be uprooted,
until the moment when the **yáng** embryo descends into the lower furnace,
its breath is left to its own accord,
and the **Dao** is fulfilled.

Therefore, the *Classic* does not speak of *numbers* but speaks of *numbers*,
does not speak of *medicines* but speaks of *medicines*.
The principles of **Lead (Qīan)** and **Mercury (Gǒng)** are fully contained here.

**Next, the method of refining with the *jiǎ* (metal):**
Six stages in total.
1. **Taming and subduing the Golden Tiger (Jīn Hǔ).**
   Can one who embraces Oneness remain undivided?

   The six transformations are the **Dao**.
   The name of the transformation is the union of **sun and moon**.
   Before their union, there is no **yin and yang**;
   after their union, they correspond to **water and fire**.
   This is the **Heaven and Earth’s natural Elixir (Huán Dān)**.

   The natural Elixir of Heaven and Earth is inherently possessed,
   neither abandoned nor detached.
   When we speak of "embracing," it means
   that humans cannot align with Heaven and Earth’s natural spontaneity.
   By relying on the three substances—**Lead, Mercury, and Metal (Jīn)**—
   through the symbols of the transformation,
   we seize the natural **qi** of Heaven and Earth,
   manipulate the furnace and crucible,
   and refine the supreme medicine.
   Thus, we emulate Heaven and Earth’s natural spontaneity.

   When speaking of humans, "embracing Oneness" means
   to remain undivided—
   this is yet unpermitted speech.

   In general, when people speak of "embracing Oneness,"
   what constitutes this "One"?

   If "One" is taken as a *number*, some say it is akin to **four (Lì)**;
   if "One" is taken as *advancement*, some say it is like **muddying the tracks (Nì)**.
   One must extinguish this "One"
   to verify the essence of **profound stillness (Zhàn Jìng)**.
   These are all methods of annihilation,
   not the **Dao of eternal transformation**.

   Therefore, the **Supreme Sage (Tài Shàng)** says:
   *"To know the One is to complete all things.
   To not know the One is to have nothing to know.
   This is a profound statement."*

   When speaking of *numbers*, from One comes Two,
   from Two comes Three.
   When speaking of **qi**, the One is the **original breath (Shǐ qì)**,
   the original being **pre-Heaven (Xiān Tiān)**,
   the same as the **Dao’s substance (tǐ)**.
   For humans, it is the **foundation of life (mìng)**.
   To establish the root of life,
   what is more fundamental than the One?
   The One is formless and boundless,
   dispersed throughout all things.

   Today’s "embracing Oneness" is actually the **embracing of yang**.
   Life and vitality arise from this.
   **Liezi** says:
   *"Is the **Dao** formless?
   It is called embracing the **void (xū)** yet not the void—
   the **symbols (xiàng)** cannot be deceived;
   it is called embracing the **real (shí)** yet not the real—
   the **Dao’s essence** is without attachment.
   This is the mystery of having and not having,
   which cannot be preserved by itself—
   this is the **Dao’s subtlety**."*

   Thus, one knows that the One is the **Dao**.
   The **Dao** is the **principle of yin and yang (yáng)**.
   The **Dao** is **yin and yang** themselves.
   Therefore, the **Dao** is called **One yin and One yang**,
   and it is also said, **"transformation is called eternal generation."**
   The **yin and yang** generate each other,
   their transformations endless,
   like the **sun and moon’s** separation and union,
   their **eclipse and manifestation** following natural law.

   Hence, at the moon’s initial birth,
   seizing fire for **nourishment (yǎng)**,
   one transformation leads to **nine (jiǔ)**,
   nine being **nine yangs (Jiǔ yáng)**,
   so embracing Oneness cannot be abandoned.

   The *Fire Record (Huǒ Jì)* says:
   *"Heaven has symbols—**sun, moon, and stars**;
   Earth has symbols—**water, fire, and metal (jīn)**.
   Though the moon is metal,
   where is its form?
   It is the **qi of the west**.
   **Shén Hé Zǐ** says:
   *"The west lacks the **original qi of metal (yuán)** borrowed from the east,
   the north’s **qi** is **water**,
   water also has no form,
   the south’s **qi** is **fire**,
   fire also has no **symbol**.
   These are **true water and true fire**."*

   Therefore, the *Immortal Classic (Xiān Jīng)* says:
   *"Black Lead is the **Water Tiger (shuǐ hǔ)**,
   the root of Heaven and Earth’s subtle transformations,
   without substance yet with **qi**.
   Red Lead is the **Fire Dragon (huǒ lóng)**,
   the **qi** of Heaven and Earth’s subtle transformations arising,
   with **qi** yet without substance.
   Indeed, humans with their **substantial bodies (yǒuxíng zhī qū)**,
   emptying their **One Heart (yī xīn)**,
   seize Heaven and Earth’s natural **qi**,
   extract **metal** from the moon,
   and interchange **water and fire**.
   When **water and fire** refine **metal**,
   the **Elixir (Dān)** is formed.
   Thus, one knows that the **Dao** is the **substance of yin and yang (tǐ)**,
   and the One is the **origin of water and fire (yuán)**.

   The **Qián** essence is **metal (jīn)**,
   sustained by **fire** for nourishment.
   To seize its **qi**, one must not abandon the One.
   The **moon’s initial birth** is the **arcane (pò)**,
   without the **hun** (ethereal soul) it lacks clarity,
   the **hun** being **fire**,
   without embracing Oneness it is insufficient to capture the **sun’s qi (Tài yáng zhī qì)**.
   Again, **metal and water** must be balanced and complete.

   Now, instead of speaking of **water**, we speak of **fire**,
   invoking the **sun** as **water**.

   The *Fire Record* says:
   *"Stars arise from **sun and moon**,
   **metal** is formed from **water and fire**.
   Therefore, we rely on the **three luminaries (sān guāng)** for illumination.
   The **Dao’s** application is not merely to obtain **symbols (xiàng)**;
   even if one attains them, one must forget their forms—
   this is its mystery."*

2. **Guard against joy and anger.**
   Concentrate the **qi** to achieve **softness (róu)**,
   can one be like an infant?

   The One is the **yang’s initial birth**.
   Like a child in the womb,
   it is guarded by **softness (róu)**,
   hence called **concentrating the qi**.
   The saying *"listen to it with the qi"* is the **Dao** of this.

   The *Classic* says:
   *"Continuous as if it exists,
   yet used without exertion.
   This is the **Dao** of concentrating the **qi**."*

   Indeed, the **yang’s** initial birth is marked by **rigidity (gāngxìng)**,
   and one must be cautious at its beginning.
   During the **returning phase (fāng fù)**, concentrate on **softness** to govern it;
   as it gradually strengthens, **rigidity** grows.
   If overdone, the **center is lost**,
   and this is the method of achieving it.

   *"Achieving"* means *"taking."*
   Taking **softness** to govern **rigidity**,
   one must not lose the **harmony (hé)**.

   After the full moon, **metal and water** are balanced.
   The **upper crescent** is like a taut string—
   straight and unyielding.
   One must not deviate or overpower it.
   **Harmony** arises from **nature (xìng)**,
   nature and **emotion (qíng)** merging,
   forming the **Dao of yin and yang**.

   When **metal** receives **fire**,
   its **substance** transforms into **Qián** (creativity),
   **Qián** shifts to **Xùn** (wind),
   and the **five phases** complete their cycle,
   returning to **Kūn** (receptivity).
   The five can nourish the One,
   and the **mother establishes the foundation (mǔ lì pín jī)**.

   The *Classic* says:
   *"Thus, the noble one seeks nourishment from the mother,
   and one must not fail to concentrate on **softness**—
   hence, like an infant without **stumbling or violence (jué bào)**."*

3. **Profoundly understand the emptiness of forms.**
   Purify and eliminate, observe the **mystery (xuán)**—
   can one remain without flaw?

   When the **heart (xīn)** transforms into **nature (xìng)**,
   desires and utilitarian emotions vanish,
   yet **nature** is hidden while the **heart** generates **delusive thoughts (wàng xiǎng)**.
   These thoughts cling to **impurities (tú)**,
   accumulating like sediment at the bottom.

   To exhaust the **Dao’s** essence,
   one must deeply inspect **Heaven’s mechanisms (tiān jī)**.
   As long as external phenomena are not forgotten,
   **evil thoughts (xié xīn)** will prevail.

   Indeed, the **Great Dao** is attained through an **empty heart**,
   thereby grasping **Heaven’s mechanisms**—
   this is **pure and clear**, and **illuminated**.

   Originally, the One arises from **non-generation (wúshēng)**,
   not solidifying yet without means to conceal its **mystery**.
   The **Qián** phase must derive from **Kūn** through **enlightenment (zhì chè)**,
   and only then can one perceive the **subtle words of the Dao (wēi jù)**,
   the **obscured desires (xī yù zhī hūn)**,
   and the **dimness of lustful reasoning (lì yù zhī chǎn)**.

   The two characters *"purify and eliminate"* emphasize **excavating the heart**.
   The **function of observing the mystery** requires first forgetting oneself,
   so that **water flows freely**,
   the **sea’s clarity** reflects the **sky’s vastness**,
   and **spirit is renewed like snow after a bath**.
   **Dispelling delusion** and **clarifying the ultimate (shū míng jiù jìng)**,
   one cannot observe the **mystery** without **Dao**,
   and follows only the **Dao**.

This text expounds on the **Jīng** of nurturing life’s essence and **Yán Huì’s** grasp of the **heart-fasting** subtlety.

**IV. The Dao of Governance Through Character**

*"To love the people and govern the realm—*
*can one truly do so without action?"*

The **Jīng’s** grand intent lies in governing the body, the family,
the realm, and the world.
Its threads converge in the **doctrines of nature and fate**,
where **Dao** cycles through **mystery and clarity**—
whether practiced in **unity or division**.
If one fails to harmonize them, they scatter.
If guided by **principle**, they align.

This passage first speaks of **nourishing the spirit and vital essence**,
its logic rooted in the **sun and moon’s interplay**,
the **conjunction of fire’s timing**,
the **advance and retreat of medicines**.
Next, it speaks of **concentrating qi to attain softness**,
**purifying and observing the mystery**—
all tracing back to the **origin of nature and fate**.

Yet suddenly it speaks of *loving the people and governing the realm*—
a shift to worldly law. How disjointed!

Not so. When speaking of the self,
the **heart is sovereign**, the **blood and qi are the people**.
A **pure heart and harmonized spirit** mean
the **honor and defense circulate freely**,
and the **blood and qi flow in order**.
The **yin and yang of the four seasons**
then follow their natural course—
neither hastening nor lagging.
This is akin to *cherishing the spirit and valuing qi*,
a **unified heart** merging with the **Dao of effortless governance**.

The *Língshū* states:
*"Heaven and Earth in hidden stillness,*
*the Six Celestial Stems weave themselves."*

This is **Heaven’s natural way**—
**effortless and complete**.

The **Dao of governing the world**
takes the people as its root.
Love them, and they gather like children.
Benefit them, and they come like deer.
With sincerity, they submit.
With joy, they obey.
Do not pervert their nature,
do not alter their virtue.
Thus they dwell in **Ren’s domain of longevity**—
where is there any *action*?

Hence, it aligns with **yin and yang**,
harmonizes with **Heaven and Earth’s function**—
what separation exists in governance?

**V. Harmonizing the Rigid Qi**

*"The Heavenly Gate’s opening and closing—*
*can one avoid being feminine?"*

The soft cannot dominate the rigid,
the masculine cannot submit to the feminine—
this is **nature**.
To be both soft and rigid,
to know masculinity while guarding femininity—
this is **Dao**.

To adhere to **nature** yet not align with **Dao**
is not the **Sage’s way**.

The Sage’s movements merge with **Dao**,
his actions resonate with **Dao**.
Zhuangzi said:
*"The Heavenly Gate has no form."*

To treat its *non-existence* as opening and closing
is to overlook its feminine essence.

The **Heavenly Gate** is **Qián**.
When spoken of through the **Six Qi**, it reaches **Xùn** as the Heavenly Gate.
When defined by the **Eight Trigrams’ positions**, **Xū-Hài** are the Heavenly Gate,
**Xùn** is the Earthly Door—**Kūn** itself.

**Qián** at **Jǐ** is pure yang—
truly masculine.
Yet it resides in **Kūn’s** position—
never detached from femininity.

At times of rigidity, it merges with softness in **virtue**—
is this not *being feminine*?

**Xū-Hài**, **Qián’s** positions,
from **Wǔ** dividing the Six Qi,
**Hài** is pure **Kūn**.
**Qián** in **Kūn’s** position—
is this not *being feminine*?

This is the **natural logic of Qián and Kūn**.

Thus, **Xùn** in the east-south—
where **yang qi** emerges—
the Heavenly Gate opens.
**Qián** in the west-north—
where **yin qi** enters—
the Heavenly Gate closes.

From **Dōngbì** to **Sì**, **Sì** is **Wèi**,
**Wèi** as the **Human Gate**—
thus **Xùn** is the Earthly Door.
Not only does this apply to **Wèi** itself.

Even in human application, it holds true.

**All** who speak of **ability** and **inability**—
this is the **transformation of nature** entering the **Dao/Way**.

Indeed, **Yíng-Pò** is the **moon**,
and **Kūn** governs the **moon**—
is this not the **refinement of the Four Symbols** to enter the **Central Palace**?

Indeed, the **Dao/Way** can give birth to things,
and pure **yang** alone cannot generate—
it relies upon **yin-yang**,
and **generation** is its meaning.
Thus, one takes its **mother**.

The **Classics** say: *"There is a named **mother** of all things—*
this is the **law**."

**Yin-yang** take the **moon** as their standard,
and within one **moon**,
from **new moon** to **full moon** and then to **waning**,
**Qián** and **Kūn** interpenetrate
to complete their **Dao/Way**.

The first three days of the **moon**,
**Zhèn** is reborn twice—
**Zhèn** receives the **Gēng** talisman,
and **Kūn** undergoes its first **transformation** into **Zhèn**.

On the eighth day, it **transforms** into **Dīng**,
and **Kūn** undergoes its second **transformation** into **Duì**.

On the fifteenth day, it **transforms** into **Qián**,
and on the sixteenth day, it shifts into **Xùn**—
the first **transformation** of **Qián**,
and on the sixteenth day, **Xīn** emerges.

On the twenty-third day, **Qián** undergoes its second **transformation** into **Gèn**.

At **cockcrow**, **Bǐng** appears,
and on the thirtieth day, **Jiǎ** loses its **brightness**—
**Qián**’s third **transformation**,
and **Kūn** **vanishes** into **Yǐ**,
until it reaches **waning**.

When **yang virtue/power** is diminished,
it **converges** with **yang** in **Gèn**,
and **nourishes** **yin** with **yang**—
the **sun** and **moon** **refine** their forms.

**Yin-yang** **interact** and **deplete** each other,
and the **moon** **obtains** its **arc** to **generate**.
On the **Gēng** day, it **receives** its **soul** and **announces** the **new moon**.

Both commence from **Gèn**,
and **Gèn** is the **threshold**.

**Zhuāngzǐ** says:
*"To enter and exit without seeing its form—*
this is called the **Heavenly Gate**."

The **Heavenly Gate** is **emptiness**.
**Qián** and **Kūn**—
when **hexagrams** are drawn, their **forms** appear,
but if **hexagrams** are not drawn, where are their **forms**?

The **Six Yang** are the **transformations** of **Qián qi**,
and the **Six Yin** are the **movements** of **Kūn’s** time.

When **Qián** **transforms** back into **Kūn**,
what **Qián** remains?
When **Kūn** **transforms** back into **Qián**,
what **Kūn** remains?
If it does not **unify** its form,
how can it **settle** its position?
One **emerges**, one **enters**,
and things **multiply** themselves.

Thus, all things **emerge** from **emptiness**,
**emptiness** **contains** **emptiness** and **emptiness**—
the **sage** **hides** within this.

**Liú**, **Tuō**, **Zhī**, **Jiàn**—
**knowing** and **seeing** **fall away**—
how can one **clearly** **perceive** all four directions?
How can one **not** **know**?

**Knowing** is **self-knowing**,
and **seeing** is **self-seeing**.
Those who **self-know** have **awakening**,
and through **knowing**, they **emanate** **Heavenly Light**.

Those who **self-see** have **clarity**,
and through the **heart**, they **delve** into the **wondrous root**.

To **see** without **seeing**—
**penetrating** and **illuminating** without obstruction.
This is not merely **lawlessness**,
but rather, **law** **pervades** all **laws**.

The **transformations** of **yin-yang**,
the **conjunctions** of **sun** and **moon**,
the **interactions** of **Qián** and **Kūn**,
the **emergences** and **entries** of **having** and **emptiness**—
**comprehended** within **one mind**,
**fully** **exhausting** their **mysteries**,
then one may be called **clear**.

**Wisdom** lies in **self-knowing**,
within **inner** **virtue/power**—
not in the **outer**.

**Seeing** lies in **self-seeing**,
within **oneself**—
not in **others**.

If **wisdom** is used for **scheming**,
what is schemed is in **things**—
this is not **stealing** the **mechanism**.

If **clarity** is used for **perception**,
what is perceived is in **affairs**—
this is not **true understanding**.

When the **time** is right to **apply** its **light**,
and then **return** to its **clarity**—
how can it be **radiant** like the **sun** and **moon**?
Even if **self-known** and **self-seen**,
one still cannot **self-know** through **knowing** and **seeing**.

The **Lengyán** **Sutra** says:
*"To establish **knowing** and **seeing** is to establish **ignorance**,
and to **liberate** from **knowing** and **seeing** is to attain **True Suchness**."*

**Keen intelligence**—
how can it not **be bent**?
**Eloquence**—
how can it not **be forgotten**?

Thus, one **knows** the **heart** of the **perfected sage**—
**knowing** yet **not speaking**,
and **speaking** yet **not knowing**.

「The **Way**’s **mystic** **application** is then summarized:

1. **Application** of the **One**—its **function** lies in **things**.
   To **generate** and to **nurture**.
   The **Dao/Way** is what the heavens and earth **await** before **generation**,
   what all **things** **await** before the **sun** and **moon** **manifest**.
   The **Yang** **resonates** at the **beginning**—*"The **Easy** [Yijing] says: 'The first emergence of all things is this,'"*—
   while the **Yin** **materializes** at the **end**—*"There is no end without completion."*—
   All **things** arise and transform through it,
   thus the **Dao/Way** is the **mother** of **things**, the **generator**.
   **Virtue/power** has the principle of **completion**—the **nurturer**.
   Without the **Dao/Way**, there is no **generation**,
   and without **virtue/power**, there is no **nurturing**.
   **Nurturing** is **cultivation**.
   Within the heavens and earth, the **Dao/Way** is the **encompassing** **cultivation**.
   It is also said: *"**Nurturing** is to **gather** [qi].*
   Yet, the **Great Dao/Way** of **One**’s **nature** has already been **fulfilled**.
   Without **virtue/power**’s **completion**, **nature** may be **impaired**.
   This chapter, from **loading** the **vital breath** [yìng] and **vital essence** [pò] to **embracing the One**, **concentrating qi**, **purifying** [díchú], and **loving the people**,
   all **proceed** from **action** to **non-action**.
   Why so?
   The heavens and earth have the **natural** **elixir** [huán’dān] **Dao/Way**,
   while humans **follow** the **metallic fire** [jīnhuǒ].
   By **refining** the **natural Dao/Way**, one **concludes** with **non-action**.
   The **Celestial Gate** [Tiānmén] **opens** and **closes**—
   **solely guarding** its **mother**,
   **not floating**, **not moving**,
   like one **without knowing**—
   then the **Dao/Way** is **exhausted** here.

   **Loading** the **vital breath** and **vital essence** is **generation**,
   **completing** the **vital breath** is **nurturing**,
   **acting** yet **reaching non-action**,
   **knowing** yet **acting as if in ignorance**—
   this is the **Dao/Way** of **restoring** the **whole**.

   **Generating** yet **not possessing**,
   **acting** yet **not relying**,
   **nurturing** yet **not dominating**—
   here lies the **function** of **non-action**.

   **Non-action** is the **mystic** **application** of the **Dao/Way**.
   The three phrases—*"**generating** yet **not possessing**, **acting** yet **not relying**, **nurturing** yet **not dominating**"*—
   emphasize the **importance** of the **character** "without knowing."

   Those who **study** the **Dao/Way** first **value** **forgetting things**,
   then **value** **having no mind**.
   The **Dao/Way** of the **Golden Elixir** [jīndān]
   **harmonizes** with the **heavenly function**.
   Though following the **master’s teachings** [shīfǎ],
   one must ultimately **conform** to **heaven’s operation** [Tiānxíng],
   **not defying** its **natural principle**.
   Yet, one **must not** **fail** to **know**,
   nor **fail** to **apply**.
   **Knowing** its **most vital essence** leads to **returning** to **non-knowing**,
   **beginning** with **action** and **concluding** in **non-action**.

   **Fire** **consumes** **metal**—
   how can there be a **mind** of **taking**?
   **Taking** is **yet not taking**.
   Thus, *"**generating** yet **not possessing**, **acting** yet **not relying**"*
   lies in the **mystic** **application** of **Yin** and **Yang**.
   How can one **rely** on its **function**?
   This **Dao/Way**, though **applied** through **Yin** and **Yang**,
   its **mechanism** is **unfathomable**—
   **Yin** and **Yang** **cannot** be **measured**.
   *"**Nurturing** yet **not dominating**"*—
   this refers to the **moon’s** **beginning** and its **fullness**,
   why **add** a **hand**?
   **Yang** **Xiong** said: *"The **perfected sage** **acts** without **handling**,
   the **perfected sage** **should** **align** with this."*

   **Revisiting** what was said before:
   **Not possessing** its **virtue/power**—
   this is called **mystic virtue/power**.
   This is said **to revisit** what came before.
   Summarizing the **essence** of this chapter,
   **praising** its **subtlety**:
   The **previous** text **revealed** the **intent** of the **heavenly elixir Dao/Way**,
   the **mechanism** of **love** and **refinement** in **bukan** [乾坤, Heaven-Earth],
   yet **unfathomable** in its **depth**,
   merely **conforming** to **worldly methods**—
   how can one **know** that the **medicines** are **complete**,
   that the **fire** and **refinement** are **without flaw**?
   The **Dao/Way** of **creation** and **transformation** **cannot** **conceal** its **subtleties**,
   and **body** and **application** **cannot** **emerge** beyond this.

   The *Yīnxíng* [阴符, *Yin Symbol* **Sutra**) says:
   *"**Knowing** and **refining**, this is called the **perfected sage**.
   It is the **mystic virtue/power**."*

   **Shào Ruòyú** said:
   *"From **loading** the **vital breath** and **vital essence** to this is called **mystic virtue/power**.
   The **heart** has **no fixed name**, **establishing** itself **according to circumstances**.
   When the **heart** **stirs**, it **adheres** to **things**,
   and **adhering** to **things** reveals the **heart**.
   When the **heart** **stirs**, it **belongs** to **Yang**,
   and is named **spirit** [shén], or also named the **heart**.
   When the **heart** is **still**, it **belongs** to **Yin**,
   and is named **essence** [jīng], or also named **nature** [xìng].
   When the **heart** **turns outward**, it becomes **vision** and **hearing**,
   and is named **soul** [hún], or also named **emotion** [qíng].
   When the **heart** **turns inward**, it **withdraws** **vision** and **returns** **hearing**,
   and is named **vital breath** [pò], or also named **intention** [yì],
   all **establishing names** **according to circumstances**.
   In total, it is named the **heart**.
   Thus one **knows** the **heart** as the **master** **bearing** the **body**,
   **without fail** **cultivating** [yíng].

   Originally, the **vital breath** is **Yin**,
   and **Yin** **follows** the **principle** of **stillness**.
   The **heart** is **internal**,
   and **stillness** allows the **vital breath** and **essence** to **settle**.
   When the **vital breath** and **essence** **settle**,
   then the **spirit** and **soul** **settle**.
   The **spirit**, **essence**, **soul**, and **vital breath**—
   **blended** and **harmonized** into **One**, called **embracing the One**.

   Though **embracing the One** can **adjust** the **Two Qi** [liǎngyì, Yin-Yang] at the **Yellow Dao/Way** [Huángdào],
   and **unite** the **Two Natures** [liǎngxìng] at the **Primordial Palace** [Yuāngōng],
   **concentrating** the **Five Phases** [wǔxíng] and **harmonizing** the **Four Symbols** [sìxiàng]—
   this is the **technique** of **longevity**,
   yet **not ultimate** in the **Dao/Way**,
   because the **heart** **adheres** to **One** [object].

   **Lǎozǐ** sighed and said: *"Can one **not depart** from it?
   **Departing** from **having** and **entering** **non-having**,
   **emptying** the **heart** to **clarity** and **stillness**.
   Initially it was called **non-action**,
   this is the name of **true heart**,
   the **Great Dao/Way**.
   Like **concentrating qi** and **governing softness** [zhìróu],
   once **concentrating qi** is spoken of,
   this **application** **depends** on the **heart**.
   With the **heart**, one **cannot** **achieve softness**,
   can it be **like** an **infant** **without heart**?
   If **purifying** all **realms**,
   **one heart** **beholding** the **mystic**,
   like **jade** **having a flaw**,
   can one **with heart** **cling** to the **mystic**,
   yet **not** **be free** of **flaws**?
   The **heart** of **loving the people** and **governing the state**,
   **cultivating** the **affairs** of the **world**,
   **manifest** in **traces**,
   with **traces** comes **worry**,
   yet **can** it **display** in **benevolence** [rén],
   **conceal** in **application**,
   and **still** **achieve non-action**?

   The **gate** of **natural** **mechanism** and **understanding**,
   the **heart** is this.
   **Opening** and **closing** to **respond** to **circumstances**,
   can it **follow** the **nature** of **things** and **emotions**,
   and **act** as **feminine** [cī]?
   The **heart** is originally **pure** and **clear**,
   **white** and **unobstructed** in all **directions**,
   yet **stained** by **knowing** and **seeing**,
   **emotional** **entanglements** **reaching** **obstruction**,
   unable to **be empty** and **still**—
   can it **be free** of **knowing** and **seeing**?

   The **One** is the **root** of **clinging** and **wandering**,
   the **source** of **generation** and **extinction**.
   Once **clinging** to **One** [object] **persists**,
   it is **not** the **Dao/Way** of **non-action**.
   To **depart** from the **trace** of **embracing the One**,
   only then does it **align** with **mystic virtue/power**.
   **Mystic virtue/power** is **generating** and **nurturing**,
   **generating** yet **not seen** in **action**,
   **virtue/power** yet **not seen** in **relying**,
   **nurturing** to **completion** yet **not dominating**—
   this is called **mystic virtue/power**.
   Hence, **Zhuāngzǐ** said: *"**Penetrating** the **One**, all **affairs** are **completed**.
   If **without heart** one **attains** the **One**, then **ghosts** and **spirits** **respond**.
   This is what is meant."*

King Zhìrán said: *"To bear the **spirit-soul** (*yíngpò*) until this is called **mystic virtue/power**.*

The **Perfect Person** (*zhìrén*) takes **embracing one’s innate nature** and **harboring the spirit** as the sequence of entering the **Dao/Way**, and **stillness** and **non-action** as the application of embodying the **Dao/Way**.

Now, to bear the **spirit-soul** (*yíngpò*)—its **substance** is **yin-stillness**, its **function** is **gentle submission**. To **control** and **guide** it properly requires the **yang-spirit** (*hún*) as its complement. The **spirit-soul** (*pò*) depends on form to achieve stillness, yet cannot move on its own. The **spirit** (*hún*) rides the form to move, yet cannot still itself. Their **separation** and **union** occur naturally, with the **spirit** (*shén*) as their sovereign—just as a chariot needs wheels. Though the hub and spokes are present, how could it move without a **chariot**? When the **chariot** is not in use, yet when it is used, for an instant it cannot be separated from it.

Thus, it is said: *‘Can one embrace the One without separation?’*

Let us examine this: **Spirit** not unified is called **emptiness** (*wǎng*), **essence** not unified is called **duality** (*liǎng*). From **things** one falls into **emptiness-duality**—what **spirituality** remains?

Indeed, because humans with life do not understand this **Dao/Way**, they lose their own **spirituality**. By the time they begin to move their hands and feet, their **essence** dissipates, their **spirit-soul** (*húnpò*) drifts away. The **spirit** (*hún*) must scatter with **perception** into the void, while the **spirit-soul** (*pò*) sinks with the corpse into the earth. All fail to return to their **true nature**—this cannot be compared to the saying of **stillness as returning to one’s original nature**.

Shī Jiānwú said: *"When **essence** abides, **qi** abides; when **qi** abides, **spirit** departs."* **Zhuāngzǐ** said: *"When **essence** is complete, **qi** is complete; when **qi** is complete, **spirit** is complete; when **spirit** is complete, the **Dao/Way** is complete."* When these three are complete, it is called **restoring form and essence**, **unifying form and spirit**, all perfectly aligning with the **Dao/Way**. Yet those who long for **true heart-mind** and **resolve**—why do they not naturally emit **heavenly radiance**?

There are those with the **heart** to learn the **Dao/Way** but lacking the **nature** to learn it; there are those with the **nature** to learn the **Dao/Way** but lacking the **heart** to learn it. Those who fear what they lose have already lost the **root** of **calming the heart** and **nurturing nature**.

Thus, **Lǎozǐ** posed the question: *"Can you concentrate your **qi** and soften like an infant? Can you keep **joy** and **anger** from showing on your face, **likes** and **dislikes** from entering your heart? When all **phenomena** confront you, you forget them—no dust of **attachment** arises. What **flaws** remain?*

The **body** is like a **state**; the **state** is like the **body**. One has never heard of the **body** being governed yet the **state** not governed, or the **state** governed yet the **body** not governed. It begins with **action** and ends with **non-action**. Though externally one may be indifferent to the **outcomes of action**, internally one must preserve the **root of non-action**.

Thus, it is said: *‘To love the people and govern the state—can one do so without non-action?’*

The *Great Clinging* (*Dà Yì*) takes **Heaven** and **Earth** as gateways; the **valley-spirit** (*gǔshén*) takes the **mysterious female** (*xiánpò*) as its gateway. **Heaven** and **Earth**, **yin** and **yang**—their **rolling**, **unfolding**, **opening**, and **closing**, their **emerging**, **entering**, **expanding**, and **contracting**—never fail their **timing**. The human body, too, does not fail to embody the **functions of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang**. Always in harmony with **Heaven**, never defying it; always yielding to **things**, never preceding them."*

Thus it is said: *"When the Heavenly gate opens and closes, can one not be like the mysterious female?*
**Pliancy and wisdom**—these are the true accomplishments of the **noble man** (*dàzhàngfū*). When he is **enlightened**, he **saves all within the Dao**; when he **applies** them, they **manifest**; when he **conceals** them, they **remain hidden**. He does not **transpose** anger, nor does he **repeat** faults.

**Abundant virtue and sage appearance**—yet throughout the day he acts as though **foolish**. Among the **Confucian disciples**, only **Yan Yuan** (*Yán Yuān*) truly attained this. To **discard** pliancy and **abandon** the body, to **separate** from form and **lose** wisdom, and thus **harmonize** with the **Great Unification** (*Dàtōng*).

**Great brightness** seems like **shame**; the **Dao** revealed appears as though **obscured**. Thus it is said: *‘When clarity is fourfold, can one not be without knowledge?’*

If so, then all **virtues and wondrous actions** are fully **possessed** by me—this is to **assist the Creator** in its **functions**. The **Dao** gives birth to ten thousand things; its **abiding** in me is such.

To **nurture** and **cherish** them—what difficulty is there? To **give birth** and **fulfill** their **nature**, to **cherish** and **exhaust** their **nourishment**, without **partial love** or **selfish gain**, so **giving birth** is not **possessive**. Without **self-praise** or **self-denigration**, so **action** is not **self-reliant**. Without **petty cleverness** or **trickery**, so **long** does he **endure** without **being slain**.

His **benefits and blessings** flow to all ages, yet he does not **claim** them as his own—**merits** cover the **world**, yet he **seems** not to **boast**. Who could **attain** and **name** him?

**Magnificent indeed!** The **Dao** suffices to **benefit things**; **virtue** suffices to **benefit people**; **action** suffices to **benefit oneself**, yet again he does not **possess**, does not **rely** upon himself, nor does he **boast** of his own. This is called **human semblance yet Heavenly**—**Heavenly virtue** is profound, distant, vast, and great.

**Man** is **equal** to **Heaven**—yet why not call it **Mysterious Virtue**?

*Moral and True Scriptures of the Dao and Virtue: Volume Fifteen ends, Volume Sixteen begins.*

**Chapter on Nourishing the Vital Essence**

Master Yinyuan, whose profound virtue traverses the Mysterious Path, oversees the compilation of affairs.
Sifu Liu Weiyong assembles the text.
Formerly honored official Ding Yidong, Director of the Imperial Treasury and Compiler of the Secretariat, verifies the text.

**On Nourishing the Vital Essence:**

Huang Maocai says:
*"Can one who nourishes the vital essence and embraces unity ever separate?"*
**Vital essence**—this is motion.
**Spirit**—this is yin.
Yin belongs to form; form, by nature, cannot move. Yet **qi** bears it and sets it in motion.
When a person cultivates and directs **qi** so it never departs from form, this is called *embracing unity*.
It is not spoken of as **qi** because only this can sustain life—there is no second way.

**Concentrating qi to achieve softness—can one be like an infant?**
Having embraced unity, over time one naturally forgets form and focuses solely on nurturing **qi**, hence form is not mentioned. What ordinary people contend for is the burden of form.
To forget one’s form and return to the state of an infant means no breath of strife remains—thus it is called *achieving softness*.
Softness is the companion of life.

**Purifying and gazing into the Mysterious—can one be without blemish?**
By this stage, both form and **qi** are forgotten.
Washing the heart clean, exhausting all filth, equal to the boundless void—how could there still be blemish?

**Loving the people and governing the state—can one act without doing?**
To study the Dao and reach *wuwei* is not the work of a single day.
Only after embracing unity, achieving softness, and gazing into the Mysterious without blemish can one attain *wuwei*.
If one has not yet reached this and yet forces oneself to *wuwei*, this is called *riding at a gallop*—ever more distant from the Dao.
The state is like the body; the people are like the spirit. Loving the people and governing the state is the same as tending to oneself.

**The Heavenly Gate opening and closing—can one avoid the feminine?**
The Heavenly Gate is the **fontanel**.
Now, the infant’s fontanel opens and closes uncontrollably. When cultivation reaches this stage, one can ascend to communicate with Heavenly Dao—thus it is called the Heavenly Gate.
**Feminine** is the same as **yin**.

**Clarity and openness in all directions—can one avoid knowing?**
To be without knowing is to know all things, like a person opening their eyes to see—nothing is unseen.
How could one say, *"I have perception"*? To have perception and lack perception is called *eye disease*.
To have knowing and not knowing is called *heart disease*.
From embracing unity, six stages progress until one reaches *wuwei*—thus, Kexue questioned Wangni four times, and four times Wangni answered, *"I do not know."* Kexue then leapt for joy—there was good reason.

**To nurture life to this point is called Mysterious Virtue.**
The Classic speaks of this twice.
The first mention refers to the **Dao**; this refers to **virtue**.
The **Dao** descends as **virtue**; the subtlest **virtue** merges once more with the **Dao**—thus it is called *Mysterious Virtue*.

Program Tai said:
*"Can one who nourishes the vital essence and embraces unity ever separate?"*
Unity is the name that encompasses all things.
When joy, anger, sorrow, and delight are about to emerge but have not yet formed,
When wisdom and insight are about to manifest but have not yet taken shape—
All these are unified into One, refined and without separation, returning to the origin where the **Dao** first emerges as One.
The **Dao** is One alone.
To ground the **Dao** in affairs and name what can be called **virtue** is already distinct from the **Dao**.
From the **virtue** one attains, one divides it into *ren, yi, li, zhi, xin* to name it—
The source grows distant, and the branches multiply beyond count.
Earlier, it was spoken of as a unified whole; now it is divided into five, and their offspring are innumerable.
Thus, Laozi thins it out, saying:
*"When the **Dao** is lost, **virtue** arises; when **virtue** is lost, *ren, yi, li* arise."*
When he says *"lost,"* he does not mean *gone*—
Rather, moving away from the root, the commandments multiply, ever more contrary to Unity.
Thus, what Laozi most treasures is the subtle, indistinct, and undifferentiated origin.
Yet Yi Yin, speaking of his attainment, places it in the realm of **virtue**, harmony, and accord.
Examining beginning and end, all conform to Unity as their standard.

Liezi’s theory is like a lost sheep with many paths:
*"Only by returning to Unity and merging can one avoid gain or loss."*
Zhuangzi says, *"**Virtue** is the totality of what the **Dao** encompasses."*
Unity is called *totality*; merging is called *returning*.
Both stem from the restoration of the Mandate—
Thus, cultivating the **Dao** must begin with embracing Unity.

The human spirit and **qi** are called *hun* and *po*.
The moon’s substance, which does not receive sunlight, is also called *po*.
This **vital essence** and **spirit** are the *young hun* and *po* paired in opposition from the *Yijing*.
The *young hun* can ascend and descend lightly, entering and exiting freely.
But the *po*’s **vital essence** is like encampment, gathering, and clustering—
Yet it is bound and constrained, unable to govern its own movement.
Thus, the ascent or descent of spirit and form is the most critical mechanism of the body.
If the spirit governs the form, all actions follow its will—
If the spirit does not reign, it is instead bent by the form, and decay follows.
Now, let the spirit be the chariot, the form the load—
The chariot moves, and the load is borne upon it—
This is the spirit already governing the form.
If a person achieves this, their will directs the form like a chariot moving its load—
Desire east, and it goes east; desire west, and it goes west—
Whatever is willed, there is compliance, no resistance.
To embrace Unity from here is not difficult.
It is only that one does not know whether, in governing the form and embracing Unity, one can persist without abandoning it.

Thus, the hesitant tone—this is doubt.
Using doubtful language to examine the superficial—
It is to make one reflect upon themselves.
Hence, Zhuangzi’s discussion of the *Yashengjing* says:
*"Can one embrace Unity? Can one avoid loss?"*
This is the very meaning.

All this chapter speaks to those who have glimpsed the **Dao** but whose guardianship is not yet firm.
If one embraces Unity and does not separate,
Achieves softness and is like an infant—
Then one is already One with the **Dao**.
If Laozi were to speak from this ground,
The doubtful language would become decisive.

「凡此章下文设疑以示者，其义皆类此也。
To embrace Unity and achieve softness—can one persist like a newborn babe? The *Liezi* describes the infant thus: *"Qi is focused and harmonized to its utmost."*
Nothing harms it, no virtue can surpass it—this speaks of its innate thickness, untainted by external things.
Mencius says: *"The noble person is one who does not lose the heart of their infant self."*
This means though they engage with the world, they do not forget their original nature.

Combining both, only those whose virtue remains unseparated can truly return to the state of the infant.
When one is about to act, their *qi* carries out their intentions as if wind conveys the chill and heat of seasons.
If one’s *qi* is not diverted elsewhere, and they focus solely on achieving softness,
Then when this softness is attained, the harmonized state that harms nothing returns once more.
It is only that one does not know whether they can reach this state.

To purify and perceive the profound—can one remain without flaw?
The profound is that which is deep and unfathomable.
*Xuànpín* (玄牝), *Xuàndé* (玄德), *Xuàntóng* (玄同), and *Xuànguān* (玄览) all describe this unfathomable realm.
To perceive the profound is to gaze within the dark and see the luminous.
This kind of perception, all have it—yet if the heart’s source is unclean,
And one’s mind wanders with external things,
Then the senses are obscured, and how can the luminous be seen?

Nánróng Zī asked Laozi: *"What is the difference between the eye and its form?
Yet the blind cannot see themselves."*
Laozi briefly illuminated the nature of innate disposition and emotions to awaken him,
And Zī thus retreated to his dwelling, called forth what he loved,
And banished what he hated—
After ten days, he returned to see Laozi.
Laozi praised his ability to purify himself.

Zī’s question concerned vision, yet what Laozi taught was about innate disposition and emotions.
If Zī could purify his disposition and emotions,
Then the obscurations would vanish on their own, and he would recover his original nature.
Thus, to purify and perceive the profound is not to exert oneself upon the eyes.
To investigate why obscurations arise and then purify them,
Then all that can be seen and known will return to its original state.
Returning to the original, one’s perception of the profound will be restored.

To love the people and govern the state—can one act without doing?
Loving the people and governing the state must involve means to execute,
And only then can intentions bear fruit—
Yet all establishing laws and affairs are but these means.
If one has means yet still warns against deliberate action,
Zhuangzi has already made this clear.
He said: *"I have heard of nurturing the world, but never of governing it."*
In the way of nurturing, one discards cleverness,
Sets aside rewards and punishments,
Follows the natural flow of life and disposition,
And finds ease in effortless harmony—
Thus, all things are not burdened.

There is one who transcends the rules and measures of law and order.
This is what is called *wuwei* (无为).

Thus, those who strive to follow the established ways cannot,
And those who seek governance through deliberate action often fail in many matters.
Hence, the warning here is like asking: *"Who can love the people and govern the state
Without resorting to contrived schemes and actions?"*
To act in accordance with nature, without deliberate intervention,
Is the very essence of the next chapter’s governance—
As vast as simmering fresh meat.

The opening and closing of the Heavenly Gate—can one avoid bias?
Zhuangzi once pointed to the realm of birth and death, existence and nonexistence,
As the Heavenly Gate—
This is the Heavenly Gate of Heaven.
He also discussed the Dao that cannot be spoken or transmitted:
*"If one’s heart rejects it, the Heavenly Gate will not open."*
This also speaks of the human heart as the Heavenly Gate.

Since the Heavenly Gate of Heaven is the realm of birth and transformation,
Then the human Heavenly Gate is also the passage of their innate vitality.
The Creator’s contraction and expansion of yin and yang,
Their successive nurturing of birth and transformation,
Is the ability to regulate the opening and closing of the Heavenly Gate.
If one’s engagement with the world is cautious,
Preserving life and death through moderation,
Judging what is appropriate and welcoming or rejecting accordingly,
Then the Heavenly Gate of one’s self
Can also regulate its opening and closing.

Cultivating to this degree is already to surpass the world and reveal its essence—
Yet to act only when appropriate, never leading the way of things,
Is not this even more excellent?

Clarity and openness in all directions—can one avoid knowing?
Clarity means no obstruction, whiteness means no darkness.
To be open in all directions is to have no closed doors or blind spots—
All four ways are thoroughly illuminated.
The distant lies beyond the eight extremes,
The near is within the space between one’s eyebrows—
If there is a distinct sound that comes to disturb me,
I must know it—
This is the clarity and openness that reaches in all directions.

When one attains this state, the danger lies in being too sharp in applying wisdom.
Without affairs, one becomes overly observant;
Encountering affairs, one becomes too probing.
Yet if one has attained the Dao, this is not so.
They have never deliberately sought to see—
Yet seeing arises from the things themselves.
The wisdom of divining from tortoise shells,
The clarity of the water mirror,
Are all its manifestations.

If one’s cultivation has not yet reached this state,
Then even with keen intelligence and sharp insight,
They may guard it with foolishness—
Could one not expose their own nature?

To nurture and accumulate life.
Originally, there is nothing—yet through creation, something arises—
Thus, it can be called *shēng* (生).
Like the Dao giving rise to Unity, and Unity to Duality.
To take what has already been born and solidify it,
Is to *chù* (畜) it.
As when one cultivates their virtue.

Nearly all the teachings in this chapter,
From embracing Unity and achieving softness onward,
Are about holding fast to virtue and seeking to return to the Dao.
The pursuit of Unity, softness, and elemental clarity is through virtue—
To hope for no separation and no flaw is to seek return to the Dao.
The methods of focusing *qi* and purifying obscurations,
Are all ways to attain virtue.
If one attains virtue, one can nurture life—
Unity, softness, and elemental clarity—
Do they come to me?
If they dwell, then I am the one who can accumulate them.»

「Ren arises from filial piety and fraternal respect,
Trust arises from what is desirable—
Both are what is called *shēng* (生).

Ren has already arisen,
Yet there is a way to delight in it,
So that it does not abandon virtue.
Trust has already been established,
Yet there is a way to fulfill it,
And when it reaches reality, it is *shēng* (生),
And then to *chù* (畜) it—
That is what is meant.

To *shēng* (生) without possession,
Is the original *wú* (無).
Yet I am the one who brings forth *shēng* (生),
And yet I do not stir to claim it as my own—
This is the lofty aspiration of those who embody the Dao.

What was spoken of before as *shēng* (生) and *chù* (畜) to attain virtue,
Is now spoken of as *bù-yǒu* (不有)—
To possess yet appear as though not possessing,
To be real yet appear as though empty,
To not dwell upon what has been attained.

To act yet not rely upon it.
As Zhuangzi said: *"When one is in harmony yet does not claim self-possession, one does not rely upon it."*

To grow yet not dominate.
To rise above and yet silently guide,
To not reveal the means of one's governance.
If one truly entrusts without dominating,
Then who shall wield its reins?
This is called *Xuán Dé* (玄德).

What was spoken of before as the eight *shēng* (生) and eight *yí* (疑),
Was because they feared one could not yet *bù-yǒu* (不有).
If one could firmly grasp all eight,
Then one’s virtue would be complete.

To complete these eight virtues,
And yet further them with *bù-yǒu* (不有), *bù-shì* (不恃), and *bù-zǎi* (不宰),
Then one’s virtue becomes profound and unfathomable—
Thus, when comparing it to all virtues,
This alone is called *Xuán* (玄).

Virtue is the Dao manifested in affairs,
Not separate from the Dao itself.
To say one loses the Dao and then attains virtue,
Is to dislike the traces of its manifestation—
If the highest virtue is not virtue,
Then its advancement is hidden and deep.

Thus, whenever one speaks of *Xuán Dé* (玄德),
Its name does not stray from *Dé* (德),
Yet its depth equals that of the Dao itself.
Zhuangzi posed the question to Sun Xian and Bian Que:
*"The Perfect One forgets their liver and gallbladder,
Discards their ears and eyes,
Lost in the world yet drifting beyond dust and filth,
Free in the realm of no affairs—
This is called acting yet not relying upon it,
Growing yet not dominating.*

Now you adorn your wisdom to astonish the simple,
Refine your conduct to expose the impure,
Shining brightly like one displaying the sun and moon—
How shall you avoid the resentment of Heaven?

If one follows your way of displaying the sun and moon,
And instead reflects inward to seek its source,
Then the realm of *Xuán Dé* (玄德) may be glimpsed.

In discussing the later chapter’s words—
That the Dao *shēng* (生) and virtue *chù* (畜)—
And further elaborating on *bù-yǒu* (不有), *bù-shì* (不恃), and *bù-zǎi* (不宰),
This is the repeated and detailed exposition of this chapter.

Yet there are differences—
This chapter speaks of virtue and Dao within the person,
While the later chapter speaks of their mutual possession by humanity.

Thus, when Laozi’s words encompass Heaven, Earth, and the Sage,
Sometimes he does not distinguish them,
Speaking broadly to show that Heaven and humanity share no different aim—
This is the general pattern of his book.

One cannot say that when speaking of Heaven, he speaks only of Heaven,
Or that when speaking of humanity, he speaks only of humanity.

Jú Zǐyáng said:
*"Qu Yǔ’s words about the spirit and the corporeal form
Originate from Laozi’s teachings.
And Yáng Xióng further expounded upon his words,
Illustrating the waxing and waning of the moon—
Though the matters they describe differ,
The intent behind their compositions is the same.*

Yet those who interpret these three texts
Cannot harmonize their meanings.
Thus, I now combine them to discuss,
Hoping that this may suffice to clarify them."*

The essence lies in the term *zài* (載), which carries the meaning of "bearing" or "supporting" by vehicle—this is the common usage of antiquity and the present world.

When it comes to a person ascending a carriage and being borne, the ancient texts and histories frequently employ this same term.
For instance, the *Hàn Jì* (漢紀) says, *"Liú Zhāng followed the envoy and was borne"* (劉章從謁者與載),
and the *Hán Jì* (韓集) says, *"Women carried the young child"* (婦人以孺子載).
These are all of the same intent.

Yet in the words of these three masters today,
the meaning of the character *zài* is likewise so.

But **Lǎozǐ** and **Qū Zǐ** speak of the human spirit,
and thus their term *yíng* (營) shares the same character as *yíng* (荧), meaning
the luminous brilliance of a crystal’s clarity.
Their term *pò* (魄) is much like what I have expounded upon in my discussion of the *Jiǔ Gē* (九歌)—
the spirit’s essence.

**Yáng Zǐ** (杨子) speaks of the luminosity of the sun and moon,
and thus takes the moon’s substance as *pò* (魄),
while the sun’s radiance is *hún* (魂).

When speaking of the human spirit,
their intent is that the *hún* (魂) is the active yang fire,
while the *pò* (魄) is the tranquil yin water,
the *hún* being twofold and the *pò* singular.
Hence, they say, *"Bearing the yíng (營) and embracing the pò (魄),*
*how could it depart?"*
They mean that the *hún* (魂) reinforces the *pò* (魄),
the active sustains the tranquil,
the fire presses the water,
the two guard the one—
and thus they do not separate.

When a person ascends a carriage and is borne,
being carried above, the *hún* (魂) is tranquil while the *pò* (魄) is clear,
the fire does not wither, nor the water overflow—
this is indeed the vital principle for longevity and enduring vision.

Though **Qū Zǐ**’s words are not fully detailed,
from his phrases *"without slipping, the hún (魂) is steadfast;
empty, to await it,"*
one may infer that his meaning aligns with this explanation beyond doubt.

When speaking of the sun and moon,
they say that the sun’s light bears upon the moon’s *pò* (魄),
illuminating it—
just as a person ascending a carriage is borne above.

Thus, *"Before the full moon, the moon is borne in the west"* (月未望，則載魄於西);
*"After the full moon, the hún (魂) remains in the east"* (既望，則終魂於東).

When tracing to the sun,
they say that as the moon waxes,
the sun’s light bears upon the *pò* (魄) in the west,
gradually filling the east,
until it reaches the full moon and then returns to its original state.

And when the moon wanes,
the sun’s light remains to guard the *pò* (魄) in the east,
gradually diminishing the west,
until it reaches the dark moon and then fully departs.

The moon thus follows the sun for its illumination—
before the full moon, the sun is on its right;
after the full moon, the sun is on its left.
Hence, it receives light from its respective position,
as the people turn toward the ruler’s transformation to form customs.

Though these three masters speak of two distinct matters,
their discussion of *zài pò* (載魄) shares the same meaning in their texts.
Thus, alchemical scriptures and Daoist practices all employ the *nà jiǎ* (納甲) method—
mutually supplementing each other to elucidate their principles,
for their fundamental logic is not truly divergent.

But those who expound upon them
fail to delve deeply into their meaning.

To speak as the Master of the Yellow River did,
when he said that Laozi took *yíng* (营) as *hún* (魂),
this is not the literal meaning of the characters,
yet he further claimed that people ride upon *hún* and *pò* (魄)
to obtain life, and should cherish and nourish them—
then he has lost the true intent of the text.
Only when considering the meaning of *zài* (载)
as roughly "to carry" does he come somewhat close.
Yet this still fails to remedy the many deficiencies in his interpretation.

If Wang Fu-si took *zài* (载) to mean "to dwell,"
and said that *yíng* (营) and *pò* (魄)
are the places where people commonly reside,
then this also aligns with the Master of the Yellow River’s view.
But in recent times, the teachings of Su Shi and Wang Yuanze emerged,
whose lifelong theories differed like water and fire,
yet both held that *hún* (魂) is the spiritual essence,
while *pò* (魄) is mere physical substance,
and sought to make the spiritual essence perpetually ride upon *pò* (魄) to act—
not to let the spiritual essence be borne by *pò* (魄).
Hong Qing-shan, in his commentary on this text,
also said that when *yángqì* (阳气) fills *pò* (魄),
it becomes *húnpò* (魂魄), and if it can move,
then life is complete.
His intent is also like that of Su and Wang,
all taking *zài* (载) to mean "to bear as a carriage carries a person."
This not only contradicts the original meaning,
but if taken thus, it would force the spiritual essence to labor constantly,
while *pò* (魄) never gains respite.
Though it may avoid the burden of material desire’s entanglement,
the profound mystery of the spiritual essence’s unity
is instead seized by overbearing *yáng* (阳),
and driven to race through the chaotic, tumultuous path of worldly distractions—
ultimately falling into the realm of common injury to life and loss of vitality,
without even knowing it.
How does this compare to the views of the two masters?

If one speaks of Yangzi’s interpretation,
then all take *zài* (载) to mean "to dwell,"
which already strays from its true indication.
Li Gu’s explanation of *hún* (魂) as *guāng* (光) is even more absurd,
until Lai Guan and Sima Gong realized its error.
Yet then they sought to correct *pò* (魄) as *bì* (胐),
which also failed to deeply examine the meaning of *zài* (载),
and thus erred even further.

Only in recent years did Wang Bo-zhao suggest
that before the full moon, *hún* (魂) is borne by *míng* (明),
seeming to grasp its meaning.
Then he further said that after the full moon,
*míng* (明) is borne to its end by *pò* (魄),
but this should read "to its end" for *míng* (明),
not "to bear *pò* (魄) to its end."
By this reasoning, it seems he also reverses the original meaning of the first clause,
falling into the same mistake as Su and Wang—
to bear from below upward.
In essence, later readers of the ancients’ texts,
unable to delve deeply,
repeatedly seek their original meaning,
yet hastily impose their own interpretations,
leading to such reckless explanations.
Worse yet, those who read *Chu Ci* (楚辞) merely indulge in its superficial brilliance,
least of all probing its profound depths.
Therefore, I have set forth this clarification,
hoping that those who peruse it may reflect upon it.
This may serve as a small aid in tracing the currents back to their sources.

Zhān Qiūpǔ said:
To bear and nurture *pò* (魄) until this point is called *xuán dé* (玄德, "Mysterious Virtue").
In *"The Chapter of Ability"* (《能为章》), it is said that when a person can take from the state of *wúzhī* (無知, "no-knowing") and *wúcī* (無雌, "no-femaleness"),
they can then forget their beginning and end in the state of *wúshì* (無事, "no-affairs").
Those who broadly extend love and benevolence to settle the people and govern the state—
I can make them unaware of where these virtues originate.

Heaven is *xuán* (玄, "Mysterious").
Femaleness is *pǐn* (牝, "vulva").
When the *tiānmén* (天門, "Heavenly Gate") opens and closes,
it can prevent *pò* (魄) from responding like a female to sounds and harmonizing in disorder.
Once this mind is already clear and open in all directions,
it can extinguish all knowledge,
and remain at peace from beginning to end.
Thus, one can do without doing and yet be able to do all things.

Zhang Chōngyìng said:
To bear and nurture *pò* (魄) while embracing *yī* (一, "Oneness") until this point is called *xuán dé* (玄德, "Mysterious Virtue").
The *hún* (魂, "ethereal soul") belongs to the liver,
while *pò* (魄, "corporeal soul") belongs to the lungs.
The *hún* is formed from Heaven’s *qì* (炁),
while the *pò* is formed from Earth’s essence.
A person’s body contains and nurtures their *hún* while guarding their *pò*;
if one can embrace the pure and unified essence-*qì* of Heaven and Earth,
interacting harmoniously without contradiction,
then by refining *qì* and softening essence,
the essence transforms into *qì*,
as *yīn* (陰) wanes and *yáng* (陽) flourishes—
the *pò* becomes tranquil, the *hún* becomes clear.
Within, it is serene as a newborn babe;
all filth is cleansed, nothing is mixed.
Ears are sharp, eyes are bright—
what one perceives is profound.
How could there be any flaw or illness in the body?

Extending this principle to governance,
if one aligns with the essence of *wǒ* (我, "self")
and cultivates the *qì* of the people,
then loving the people and governing the state will naturally possess an ineffable efficacy.

Conversely, if practiced in reverse:
when the *tiānmén* (天門, "Heavenly Gate") opens,
all orifices remain unobstructed,
and *cīpò* (雌魄, "feminine *pò*") transforms into *xióngqì* (雄炁, "masculine *qì*"),
so that *cīpò* cannot bring chaos.
When the *dìhù* (地户, "Earthly Portal") opens subtly,
transformation occurs without words,
and clarity spreads universally—
people become unknowable.
Thus it is said:
*"To generate and nurture"*—
once true *qì* (真炁) is generated,
it must then be further nurtured.
*"To generate but not possess"*—
once *qì* is generated,
it must not be depleted or wasted.
*"To act but not rely"*—
once essence transforms into *qì*,
one must not arrogantly harm it.
*"To lengthen but not dominate"*—
it must be generated and then nourished,
and then further protected—
do not slaughter the *qì* and harm its growth.
Thus, its mystery—I have attained it—
this is called *xuán dé* (玄德, "Mysterious Virtue").

Zhang Língyìng said:
A person’s body contains
Heaven’s *yī* (一, "One"), giving rise to *yuánqì* (元炁, "Original *qì*"),
and Earth’s *yī* (一, "One"), giving rise to *yuánjīng* (元精, "Original Essence").
At the *zǐ* hour (子, midnight), *yī yáng* (一陽, "One Yang") first stirs,
and at the *wǔ* hour (午, noon), *yī yīn* (一陰, "One Yin") first emerges.
If one grasps this,
essence will not be lost, *qì* will not be diminished—
how could the spirit not be at peace?
To store essence and nurture *wú* (無, "Non-being"),
the practice lies in the gradual ascent and descent of the *zǐ* and *wǔ* hours,
holding steady while embracing it—
entering gradually, naturally accumulating success day by day.

Bái Yùxiān said:
To bear and nurture *pò* (魄).
To settle the heart and embrace *yī* (一, "Oneness").
To be able to remain undivided.

「Where does one depart and where does one return?
To focus the *qi* and attain softness.
To purify the clear and eliminate all impurities.
Can one be like an infant?
Mixed and undivided as one whole.
To wash away and transcend the subtle and profound.
To have no mind in affairs, no affairs in the mind.
Can one be without flaw?

Body and mind as one.
To love the people and govern the realm.
To delight the spirit and nourish the *qi*.
Can one be without knowledge?

To have no thought, no action,
no consideration, no worry.
The *Tiānmén* (天門, "Heavenly Gate") opens and closes,
The heart’s foundation becomes bright and clear.
Can one be without flaw?

One without division,
Illuminating all with clarity.
Like ice melting beneath the moon’s brilliance.
Can one be without knowledge?

All day as a fool—
Life nurtures and accumulates within me.
One mind’s dwelling, containing all phenomena,
Life gives yet does not possess.
The heart aligns with the *Tàixū* (太虚, "Great Emptiness").
Act yet do not claim credit.
Wisdom encompasses all things.
Lengthen yet do not cut short.
Calm and unselfed, this is called *Xuándé* (玄德, "Mysterious Virtue").

Lǎo Cùirán said:
To bear and nurture *pò* (魄, "Ethereal Soul").
Now knowing its *zǐ* (子, "child"), again guarding its *mǔ* (母, "mother").
To embrace *yī* (一, "Oneness") and quiet the mind.
Can one remain undivided?

The Dao/Way cannot be separated for even a moment.
To focus the *qi* and attain softness.
To direct one’s intent without division—
thus, the spirit is concentrated.
Can one be like an infant?

Return to childlike simplicity,
Desireless and actionless.
To wash away and transcend the subtle and profound.
Neither seeing nor hearing,
Inner and outer emptiness and clarity.
Can one be without flaw?

Thus, no sickness or affliction.
To love the people and govern the realm—
A ruler governs the world with the Dao/Way,
I too love the spirit and guard the spirit.
Can one be without action?

Thus, no reckless deeds.
The *Tiānmén* (天門, "Heavenly Gate") opens and closes—
The crown of the head splits apart,
The Yang spirit enters and departs.
Can one be without duality?

The *Yīnguǐ* (陰鬼, "Yin Ghost") dissipates,
No demonic hindrance remains.
Illuminating all with clarity—
The divine light radiates resplendent,
Flowing in all eight directions.
Can one be without knowledge?

Naturally and effortlessly,
Beyond what can be known.
Life nurtures and accumulates within me—
The Dao/Way of itself generates me,
*Virtue/Power* (德) also completes me.
Life gives yet does not possess—
Returning to the root, forgetting form and self.
Act yet do not claim credit—
Enlightenment bestows upon me,
Yet expects no recompense in return.
Lengthen yet do not cut short—
It lengthens and completes me,
Thus no harm comes to me.
This is called *Xuándé* (玄德, "Mysterious Virtue").
So it is said: "With virtue, one's Dao/Way is naturally fulfilled."

Chén Bìxū said:
To bear and nurture *pò* (魄) while embracing *yī* (一, "Oneness"),
Can one remain undivided?

The Daoists say the Yang spirit is called *hún* (魂, "Corporeal Soul"),
And the *hún* delights in life.
The *Yīnguǐ* (陰鬼, "Yin Ghost") is called *pò* (魄),
And the *pò* prefers death.
The *hún* wanders, the *pò* remains still.
*The Bái Hǔ Tóng* (白虎通, "White Tiger Discourses") says:
*The hún* is like clouds—
*Yíng* (營, "Ethereal Soul") is the restless, unsettled form.
Thus, the *hún* is called *yíng*.
The old sayings state:
"To bear" means "to ride," and *yíng* is the *hún*.
It is also said that *yíng* protects the Yang *qi*.
Now, the *hún* is the Yang Essence,
The *pò* is the Yin Spirit.
The Yang Essence thrives on movement and dissipation,
Thus Daoist texts have methods to restrain and retain it.
The Yin Spirit is prone to confusion and disturbance,
Thus Daoist texts have laws to subdue and control it.
If one’s form constantly rides the Yang Essence and Yin Spirit,
Embracing and guarding the pure, harmonious *Tàihé* (太和, "Great Harmony") *qi*,
So that it does not scatter or separate,
Then one will forever preserve longevity.

The Daoist practice of embracing *yī* (一, "Oneness")
Is like a mirror containing clarity—
Clarity does not separate from the mirror.
This teaching is about nurturing the spirit.
Now I explain:
"Can one remain undivided?" is the Master Lao’s questioning tone,
Like asking, "Can one uphold the precepts?"
Now, if one wishes to practice the art of embracing *yī*,
One must be able to keep the mind undivided.
If one can keep the mind undivided,
Then one is riding the *hún* and *pò*,
Embracing the pure, harmonious Dao/Way.

Can one be like an infant?
All the following points are explained with this meaning.

To focus the *qi* and attain softness—
Can one be like an infant?
The old sayings state:
"To focus" means "to be one" and "to entrust."
*Qi* is the *Chōnghé miàoqì* (沖和妙氣, "Unifying and Harmonious Marvelous *Qi*"),
Also the natural *qi*.
A person stands alone, transformed by nature,
Receiving the natural, unifying, harmonious marvelous *qi*.
As the *qi* descends and the form is born,
It remains untainted and pure.
If one entrusts to the unifying marvelous *qi*,
Forgets all knowledge and perception,
Allows the *qi* to naturally purify and harmonize,
And the form to naturally soften and weaken—
Unharmed by all evil,
This is attaining the complete harmony of an infant.
This teaching is about nurturing the *qi*.

Now I explain:
"Can one be like an infant?" means,
When one desires to focus the *qi* and attain softness,
Can one be like an infant in pure harmony?
If one can be like an infant in pure harmony,
Then one has attained the art of focusing the *qi* and attaining softness.

To wash away and transcend the subtle and profound—
Can one be without flaw?
The old sayings state:
"To wash away" means "to cleanse."
"To transcend" means "to dispel" and "to regulate."
*Xuánlǎn* (玄覽, "Subtle Perception") is the illumination of the mind.
*Cī* (疵, "flaw") refers to imperfections and diseases.
A person should cleanse dust and filth,
Dispel the Five *Emotions* (五情),
Inner and outer emptiness and clarity,
The mind illuminated over all things—
Imperfections and diseases do not arise.
This teaching is about cultivating the heart.

From these three matters above,
It concerns oneself in cultivating the body.
From these three matters below,
It encourages governing the realm.
The Classic says:
"Cultivate it in oneself, and its virtue is true.
Cultivate it in the world, and its virtue is universal."

Now I explain:
"Can one be without flaw?" means,
When one desires to cleanse the heart and dispel impurities,
To introspect all inner and outer matters,
One must be able to self-examine,
To have no flaws or imperfections.
If one can have no flaws or imperfections,
Then one has attained the method of washing away and transcending the subtle and profound.

To love the people and govern the realm—
Can one be without action?
The old sayings state:
"To love the people" means to love them as one’s own children,
In governing, one must not be harsh or cruel,
Taxes and labor must not harm their nature.
"To govern the realm" means to focus on agriculture and simplify matters,
Allowing the people to pursue their vocations and live in peace—
This is the transformation of *Wuwéi* (無為, "Non-action").

Now I explain:
"Can one be without action?" means,
When a ruler desires to love and nurture all people,
To not harm their natural inclinations,
To govern by focusing on agriculture,
To avoid unnecessary complexity,
One must be able to remain calm, clear, and without action.
If one can remain calm, clear, and without action,
Then one has attained the art of loving the people and governing the realm.

The *Tiānmén* (天門, "Heavenly Gate") opens and closes—
Can one be without duality?
*The Tiānmén* is the gate of nature.
Nature generates the *Tàijí* (太極, "Supreme Pole"),
The *Tàijí* generates Heaven and Earth,
Heaven and Earth generate Yin and Yang,
Yin and Yang generate all things and destroy all things—
Life and death proceed through this gate,
Thus it is called the *Tiānmén* (天門, "Heavenly Gate").」

「Opening refers to *sànshī* (散施, "dissemination and giving"), closing to *xīlǐn* (歙敛, "withdrawal and restraint"). When the gate opens, all things flourish; when it closes, they wither and perish. Though it generates myriad beings, one does not see its *shēngshēng* (生生, "life-giving life"); though it destroys all things, one does not see its *sǐsǐ* (死死, "death-dealing death"). Life and death proceed through this gate unseen—is this not called *natural* (自然)?

Those who embody *natural* (自然) are none other than the *Dàrén* (大人, "Great Person"). The *Dàrén* measures the cosmos with their breadth, their *qi* (氣) encompasses Yin and Yang. When they act with *qīngjìng* (清静, "serene stillness") and *wéijìng* (雌静, "receptive quietude"), the cycles of life and death, flourishing and decline, do not enter their mind.

*Wéijìng* (雌静) is the subtle *mystic application* (妙用) of *natural* (自然). For those who cultivate the self and govern the realm, they must always uphold *wéijìng* (雌静) as their principle.

The old saying explains:
*The Tiānmén* (天門) is the gate of the *Zǐgōng* (紫宫, "Purple Palace") at the *Beǐjī* (北极, "North Pole"). In the heavens, the *Beǐjī* (北极星, "North Pole Star") resides within the *Zǐgōng* (紫宫). Within this palace, the *Wǔdì* (五帝, "Five Emperors") succeed one another in their reigns of rest and rule (*xiūwáng* 休王), thus the gate has opening and closing.

When it opens, it aligns with *Tài* (泰, "Harmony"); when it closes, it aligns with *Pǐ* (否, "Disharmony"). Hence, in spring, the *Qīngdì* (青帝, "Green Emperor")’s gate opens while the others close. Such is the example of the four seasons, and likewise, the *Wǔyùn* (五运, "Five Phases/Processes") of completion and renewal, the shifts in *lìshù* (历数, "cosmic cycles") and their rise and fall—these are not constant. Only the *sage* (圣人) knows *Tian* (天, "Heaven") and *Mìng* (命, "Fate"), perpetually guarding *wéijìng* (雌静) and *qiānxìa* (谦下, "humble receptivity"), thus they are not swayed by change. Therefore, they attain *Yǒnghéng Yuánjí* (永亨元吉, "eternal prosperity and primal auspiciousness").

Some discuss this in terms of self-cultivation: *Tiānmén* (天門) refers to the nose and mouth. Opening and closing mean *chuǎnxī* (喘息, "breathing") and *hūxī* (呼吸, "respiration"). When one embodies *wéijìng* (雌静) and *róuhé* (柔和, "gentle harmony"), their breath becomes deep and expansive, continuous and subtle, nurturing their *spirit* (精神) into *tiánrán* (恬然, "tranquil repose"), free and effortless.

Now I explain:
Those who can practice *wéijìng* (雌静) speak of the *Tiānmén* (天門) opening and closing in rest and rule (*xiūwáng* 休王)—this is the constant of *lìshù* (历数). Only those who guard *wéijìng* (雌静) and *qiānxìa* (谦下) can thus prevent Yin and Yang from altering them, nor can cold and heat change them.

*Míng* (明, "illumination") and *Sìdá* (四达, "fourfold penetration")—can one truly be without knowing (*wúzhī* 能无知)?

The old saying explains:
*Míng* (明) means *huìzhào* (慧照, "wise illumination"). For self-cultivation, even with a mind of *huìzhào* (慧照), one’s *cleverness* (聪明) and *Sìdá* (通达) should be as though without perception or hearing. In governance, one’s *virtue* (德) should be *míngbái* (明白, "clear and luminous"), like the sun and moon’s radiance, penetrating the four seas. Yet, one must block their *cleverness* (塞聪) and obscure their *illumination* (蔽明), achieving *wúzhī* (无知, "non-knowing") so that the people of the world live their daily lives unaware—this is called *having the Dao* (有道).

Now I explain:
Those who seek *zhìhuì míngbái* (智慧明白, "wise illumination") and *Sìdá* (四达) must first practice *shōushì fǎn tīng* (收视反听, "withdrawing sight and inverting hearing"). Only then can they perpetually uphold *wúzhī* (无知). If one attains *wúzhī* (无知), then it is the *source* (原) of *wise illumination* (智慧明白) and *fourfold penetration* (四达).

To *nurture* (畜) life is the ultimate *Xuándé* (玄德, "mystic virtue"). It means that in cultivating the self and governing the realm, one can enact the six affairs above—like the Dao’s *shēngwù* (生物, "life-giving"), not obstructing its source, allowing it to flourish naturally; or *virtue’s* (德) *yǎngwù* (养物, "nurturing beings"), not restraining their nature, preserving their innate essence.

The myriad things arise singularly—does the *sage* (圣人) not rely on them? All classes pursue their own endeavors—does the *sage* (圣人) depend on them? Moreover, things grow and nourish themselves—where does the *sage* (圣人) preside over them? This is the *forgetting merit and forgetting things* (忘功忘物), penetrating the *míngjí* (冥极, "profound depths"), called *yuāndé* (渊德, "abyssal virtue").

*Wang Bi* (王弼) says:
*Yuāndé* (渊德) is *having virtue without knowing its master* (有德而不知其主), emerging from the *yōumíng* (幽冥, "mysterious darkness").

*Xiè Túnán* (谢图南) says:
*To bear the spirit and the vital force* (载营魄) until there is no separation (*wúlí* 无离).

The *Shū* (书, *Book of Documents*) says:
*"O! the spirit is born"* (哉生魄), pointing to the sixteenth day of the month. After the *jìwàng* (既望, "full moon"), the *spirit* (魄) is born as the *light* (明) dies, marking the initial growth of *Yin* (阴).

In a person’s body, the *soul* (魂) is *Yang* (阳), while the *vital force/spirit* (魄) is *Yin* (阴). When *Yin* (阴) is growing, the *vital force/spirit* (魄) is restless and strives forward, yet if one guards *unity* (一) without separation, they will not be overcome by *Yin* (阴).

*Unity* (一) is the *Xuán* (玄, "mystic") of Heaven, the *Yang* (阳). Applied to the realm, it means that the *small people* (小人) cannot overcome the *gentlemen* (君子), for they share the same Dao.

*Concentrating qi to achieve softness* (专气致柔)—can one be like an *infant* (婴儿)?

*Huáng Shígōng* (黄石公) says:
*Softness can overcome hardness* (柔能胜刚), *weakness can overcome strength* (弱能胜强). The *method of nourishing the body* (沁养身之道) takes *softness* (柔) as its foundation. If one’s *qi* (氣) is not concentrated, then the *strong and violent Yang* (强暴之阳) will exploit it. One must be like an *infant* (婴儿) before they are *cháibéi* (孩, "childlike"), the ultimate of *softness* (柔). Human desires, if many, will surely be controlled by the *strong Yang* (强阳)—this must be guarded against.

*Washing away and penetrating the mysterious* (涤除玄览)—can one be without *flaws* (疵)?

The *classic* (经) says:
*"Though the sage may have splendid dwellings, their repose is lofty and detached"* (圣人虽有荣观，燕处超然). This is the meaning of *Xuánlǎn* (玄览, "mystic penetration").

*垂旒蔽目* (Chuíliú bìmù, "hanging tassels to blind the eyes") means not desiring one’s eyes to engage with external things. Engaging externally with things, one’s internal mind follows suit. The way of cultivating the self is to *not see what is desirable* (不见可欲), so the mind does not stray. Washing away the external, one’s vision aligns with *Xuánwéi* (玄微, "mystic subtleties"). To be without *flaws* (疵) means that human desires cannot intrude upon Heavenly principle (*Tiānlǐ* 天理).

*Loving the people and governing the realm* (爱民治国)—can one be without action (*wúwéi* 能无为)?

Cultivating the self is the foundation for governing the realm. The root of the world lies in a *clear mind* (内心清明), not being seized by *sìyù* (嗜欲, "greedy desires"). Then, one can love each and every person, govern the realm, and achieve *wúwéi* (无为, "non-action"), making *no action* (事无事) into *action* (事).

*Yáo’s* (尧) *fēixīn* (非心, "non-attachment") and *Shùn’s* (舜) *gōngjǐ* (恭己, "self-respectful humility") are all of this Dao.

*The Tiānmén* (天門) opens and closes—can one be without *Yin* (雌)?

The *classic* (经) says:
*"Block the *Yuè* (兑, "Joy/Compliance") and close the gate, and one will move not all their life."* (塞其兑，闭其门，终身不动)

*The Tiānmén* (天門) refers to the *Shàngqián Gōng* (上乾宫, "Upper Qian Palace"). *雌* (Wéi, "receptive") is *Yin* (阴). The opening and closing of *Tiānmén* (天門) is to have a *constant measure* (常度), preventing *Yin* (阴邪, "perverse Yin") from exploiting it—then one’s body is in harmony.

Applied to the realm, this means *excluding the four gates* (辟四门) and *not employing the small people* (小人勿用).

*Míngbái Sìdá* (明白四达)—can one be without knowing (*wúzhī* 能无知)?

*Viewing* (视) is not with the eyes but with the *Dao* (道), then *illumination* (明) can be *fourfold* (四达). *Open and unobstructed* (疏通无蔽), yet one can name what comes—*private desires* (私欲) cannot interfere. Even what is near, at the edge of one’s sight, is not seen—how much more so with what is distant?

Those who attain *wúzhī* (无知) are not *seeking to know* (不求知). *Not stepping outside the door yet knowing the world* (不出户而知天下), *not peering through the window yet seeing Heavenly Dao* (不窥牖而见天道)—how can this be achieved by *knowing through knowing* (有知知之)?

*The Guān Yǐn Zǐ* (关尹子) says:
*"One emotion, one vital force—this is the sage"* (一情冥为圣人).

*Nurturing life* (生之畜之) reaches the ultimate of *Xuándé* (玄德, "mystic virtue").」

When falsehoods are extinguished, Heavenly Principle flourishes naturally.
Applied to oneself, it means accumulating virtue within, growing daily without self-awareness.
Applied to the world, it means every person and thing is encompassed within nurturing and growth, yet never claiming credit for it.
This is what constitutes *Xuándé* (玄德, "mystic virtue").
*Xuán* (玄) is Heaven; *zǎi* (宰) is Master—
Indeed, when examined:
the Yang cannot exist without Yin, nor Yin without Yang—this is inevitable.
Yet the Sage ever seeks to advance Yang and suppress Yin—is this not Yang as the Noble, Yin as the petty?
Yin within oneself becomes a burden to the body;
petty men in the state become a harm to the nation.
The Way of cultivating the self and governing the state is one and the same.

Thus, with no thought and no action,
yet never losing the heart of the innocent child—
unaware and unknowing,
while utterly repelling all external malevolent *qi*,
one’s body may then attain ease and freedom.
Extended to the world and the state—what further effort is needed?

Vast as Heaven’s movement, profound as divine transformation—
there exists an unknowable yet natural operation—
is this not *Xuándé*?

Shùn’s Heavenly Virtue lies in his harmonizing with Heaven’s Principle and the affairs of things—
is this not the case?

Lín Yōngzhāi says:
*"To bear the *yíngpò* (营魄) is called *Xuándé*."*
*Yíng* (营) is *hún* (魂, spirit), *shén* (神, mind);
*Pò* (魄) is *jīng* (精, essence), *qì* (气, vital force).
These three characters hold the profound intent of *Lǎozǐ*.
*"To bear"* is like a cart bearing goods—
placing *"bear"* above and *"yíngpò"* below, like a riddle.
If *pò* bears *yíng*, it is the common man;
if *yíng* bears *pò*, it is the Sage.
Together, they form a unity;
separated, they are two.
*"Bao"* (抱) means unity—
its meaning is: *Can one embrace unity and remain undivided?*
Would one allow division into two?
Thus it asks: *Can one embrace unity without separation?*
These six words hold deep meaning—
they urge self-reflection and enlightenment.

An infant, untouched by perception, possesses concentrated *qi*.
*Zhèng* (政) means extreme; *róu* (柔) means yielding.
If one can, like the infant, concentrate *qi* and attain supreme yielding,
then one can embrace unity.
Thus it asks: *Can one be like the infant?*
These are *Lǎozǐ*’s questioning words—
meaning: *Can people truly achieve this?*
The following sentences are the same.

To purify flaws and contemplate the profound darkness,
one must have a discriminating mind.
The flawless is without discrimination—
even when purifying flaws, if one holds no notion of impurity or purity,
then one can embrace unity.

If one has the merit of loving the people and governing the state,
yet holds a heart of *wuwei* (无为) while acting,
then one can embrace unity.

In the interplay of Yin and Yang, the principles of male and female,
though there is the natural interplay of attraction and response,
one must lack the discriminating mind of attraction and response—
then one can embrace unity.

The *Tiānmén* (天门, Heavenly Gate) refers to the natural principles between Heaven and Earth—
this is a metaphor borrowed from creation.
Because of such language, it has entered the realm of cultivation,
and some have mistakenly used it for heretical teachings,
thus misleading many.

*Míngbái Sìdá* (明白四达)—
to be open and unobstructed in all things,
yet to regard *wúzhī* (无知) as knowing—
this is to embrace unity.

*Shēng zhī xù zhī* (生之畜之)—
speaking of the interplay of creation,
which nurtures all things.
How does creation ever regard them as existing?
How does it ever rely on them as capable?
Though it is the sovereign of all things,
how does it ever hold the heart of controlling them?
Only thus can it be called the profound and mysterious virtue.

The intent of this chapter is, broadly,
to emphasize *wuwei* (无为) while acting,
to be natural and effortless—
for the heart to remain ever empty.
Thus, the mind bears the *pò* (魄),
not the *pò* bearing the mind—
this is the Sage’s affair.
If the *pò* bears the mind, it becomes attached to form.
The *Lǎozǐ*’s text, broadly,
is about being able to be real yet empty,
able to have yet be without—
this is the ultimate Dao.
From all angles, it speaks of this principle alone.

Fàn Yìngyuán says:
*"To bear the *yíngpò* and embrace unity—can one remain undivided?"*
*Yíngpò* is *húnpò* (魂魄, spirit and vital force).
The *Nèiguān Jīng* (内观经) says:
*"Movement to nourish the body is called *hún* (魂);
stillness to settle the form is called *pò* (魄)."*
Hé Shànggōng says:
*"Yíngpò* is *húnpò*—
the *hún* belongs to Yang, the *pò* to Yin.
*Yī* (一) is the Dao’s unity—
meaning the body bears the *húnpò*,
embracing the Dao’s unity,
never separating for an instant.
Can people achieve this?"

To concentrate *qi* and attain extreme yielding—
can one be without flaws?
*Zhuān* (专) means steadfast and unyielding.
*Cī* (疵) is blemish or disease.
The infant’s *qi* is concentrated and harmoniously yielding—
meaning it does not resist *qi*,
thus attaining harmony and yielding.
To always remain as in infancy—
can people achieve this?

If the heart is not empty, it cannot be clear;
if unclear, it cannot be penetrating—
meaning to eliminate private desires,
to refine the original heart to pristine clarity,
like jade without flaws,
like a mirror without dust—
then in contemplating affairs,
all are within the natural Principle.
Can people achieve this?

To love the people and govern the state—
can one act without acting?
Meaning that embracing unity, concentrating *qi*, purifying desires,
after cultivating the self and clarifying the heart,
one can extend this Dao to all people—
this is the foundation of loving the people and governing the state.
Following natural principles to respond to affairs,
there is always the proper path to take.
Thus, for those who love the people,
it is not mere partial affection,
but to not harm them—this is the ultimate love;
for those who govern the state,
it is not mere partial governance,
but to not let it fall into chaos—this is the ultimate governance.
Can people achieve this?

The opening and closing of the *Tiānmén* (Heavenly Gate)—
can one avoid the male?
The *Tiānmén* refers to the entry and exit of one’s mind and spirit—
though the mind and spirit cannot truly be said to enter or exit,
yet responding to things is exit,
responding to oneself is entry.
Exit is opening,
entry is closing.

One must speak thus—it cannot be otherwise.

The *Zhuangzi* ["Heaven’s Operation" chapter] states:
*"Zheng* is uprightness—if one’s heart rejects this,
the *Tiānmén* will not open.
Chéng Xuányīng’s annotation also says:
The *Tiānmén* is the heart.
*Rú* (雌) means to abide in stillness and gentle harmony—
it is the principle of responding only after being moved.

Héshànggōng and Sū Zhì both interpret *rú* as *rú* (雌).
Some manuscripts read *wú rú* (无雌), likely not the original intent.
For the text indeed speaks of ‘knowing the *xióng* (雄) while guarding the *rú* (雌).’
By *rú*, it means: the heart is the Heavenly Heart—
at every moment of motion and stillness,
one must remain *rú* (gently yielding),
so that the spirit and *qi* flow harmoniously,
and thus the opening and closing of yin and yang *qi*
are also in harmony.

Can one be without knowing?
*Míngbái* (明白) is emptiness;
*Sìdá* (四达) is openness.
This heart, empty and luminous, vast and unobstructed,
responds only after being moved—
yet remains ever empty and without self,
acting without acting—
can people achieve this?

For this heart does nothing yet accomplishes all—
non-action is its root,
omni-action its manifestation.
Yet root and branch are one:
grasp the root, and one act moves all things,
and everywhere is correct;
master the branch, and all things return to unity,
and never stray.
But one must guard the root—
then the branch will naturally return to unity.

*"Shēng zhī xù zhī zhì shì wéi xuándé"*—
*"Nurturing life and fostering growth until this point is called the Mysterious Virtue."*
*"Xù"* means to nourish the root.
All things arise from the Dao and are born,
and are sustained by virtue—
yet they are born without being claimed,
nurtured without reliance on merit,
and when fully grown, are not dominated.
Thus all things find their place,
and yet they do not know why—
this is called the Mysterious Virtue.

The Sage embodies the Dao without trace,
transforming all things broadly—
thus the people do not know the Emperor’s power;
this is the Mysterious Virtue.

Xuē Yǒngzhāi says:
*"Nurturing the spirit and embracing the One—
can one avoid separation?"*
Wén Xuán’s Master says:
*"Cultivating the spirit and embracing the True One—
can one avoid their separation?"*

The utmost yin is solemn and still,
the utmost yang is radiant and vast—
solemn stillness issues from Heaven,
radiant vastness arises from Earth.
Their interaction—
then the essence of the sun and moon is carried,
and the breath of Heaven and Earth is drawn—
mother and child guard each other,
like fish in water—
this is the Dao of eternal life and longevity.

Wáng Bǎo says:
*"Gathering essence and converging spirit—
is there not some knowing involved?"*
*"Specializing in *qi* and attaining gentleness—
can one be like an infant?"*
To focus on nurturing *qi* until bones weaken and sinews soften—
can one be like an infant?
*"Purifying and gazing into the Mysterious—
can one be without blemish?"*
To gaze into the transformations of all things yet remain without flaw—
this is only because the gaze into the Mysterious still lingers.
If one purifies and discards the Mysterious gaze,
then there will be no blemish.

Loving the people and governing the state—
can one act without acting?
The heart is the sovereign,
the body is the state,
essence and *qi* are the people.
If the sovereign governs without acting,
the state grows rich and the people are at ease.
If one acts instead,
not only is it unbeneficial—
it brings harm.

The opening and closing of the *Tiānmén*—
can one remain *rú* (gently yielding)?
Heaven is the heart,
the Gate is where all laws emerge.
Opening and closing are release and withdrawal.
*Rú* is gentleness—
the Mysterious Mechanism’s subtle operation
sometimes withdraws in gentle harmony,
without harshness or injury,
walking in accordance with response,
subtle and penetrating, boundless and unobstructed,
yet without self-praise or arrogance—
steadfastly, as if without knowing—
the Three Powers act through the Dao and give birth,
all things are nurtured by virtue.
Though they are born and nurtured,
one does not claim the merit;
though they are the masters of transformation,
one does not rely on one’s exalted status—

All things receive the grace of Heaven,
and thus grow and flourish—
yet none claim dominion.
To let them grow and transform naturally
is called attaining the Great Dao.

Master Chu Bo-xiu remarked:
*"The phrase '载营魄' signifies the Mysterious Virtue."*

The opening character *zài* (載) in the chapter’s title
has long baffled interpreters.
It seems the first three characters form a clause,
with *"bào yī"* (抱一) belonging to the following text,
akin to the structure of later passages—
thus requiring careful parsing to align meaning.

Upon deep reflection,
I found in Master Guo Zhong-shu’s *Pèi Jiě Jí* (佩解集),
quoting the Kaiyuan Edict:
*"With reverence for the Sacred Teachings,
I pondered the Profound Essence,
and recently altered the tenth chapter’s
original *zài* (載) to *zāi* (哉),
restoring it to the preceding sentence.
When the matter was deliberated,
all agreed it was correct.
Thus, the true meaning was clarified,
and the commentary was refined.
This resolves a thousand years of confusion."*

For the ancient text was unchaptered;
later scholars mistakenly severed the phrase
*—the Dao, the virtue—*
at the end of the sentence,
then appended the next chapter’s opening,
and in transcription, *zài* (載) was corrupted to *zāi* (哉).
The structure of Chapter 53’s closing
*—not the Dao—*
proves this error.

Now, examining the Kaiyuan Emperor’s *Daodejing*,
it also renders *zài* (載) at the start,
with the initial interpretation.
Du Guangting further expounds it as *"to bear and convey."*
In *Bùcéng Lí Zhāng* (不曾离章),
it reads *zāi* (哉).
Yet I do not know the source of Guo Zhong-shu’s citation.
Given Master Chu’s reference,
I provisionally retain this view.

The *Dingguan Jing* states:

*"Movement nourishing the body is called the soul (魂),
stillness governing the form is called the spirit (魄).
The soul, bright and yang, ascends;
the spirit, dark and yin, descends.
Yang moves, yin stirs—
together they forge transformation.
The two qi lodge in form and circulate,
yet if they cannot return to their root,
day by day they dwindle, month by month they perish—
leaves fall, the tree withers.

The Sage teaches the soul and spirit to both embrace *One*.
*One*—that from which the Dao is born,
the origin of numbers, the source of all things.
In humankind, it is the primal nature.
When soul and spirit cling to *One*,
they do not depart—
then movement and stillness are both forgotten,
and the Dao remains unattained.
If one steadfastly guards the qi without interruption,
then one attains the utmost softness,
unmoved by joy or anger.

If guarding the qi is not steadfast,
then forceful yang can intrude,
and at the slightest provocation, it erupts violently—
the scattered, dissipated qi cannot sustain life,
nor can the form endure without spirit.
How could this not be taken with utmost care?

Like an infant—
though it lacks knowledge,
its joy and anger are pure,
a single harmonious breath.
This is the secret work of the Mysterious Gate,
the method of refining qi and regulating breath
passed down through the ages.
Yet most stray into false paths,
few attain the true way.

The Dao lies in simplicity,
in tranquil stillness, never straying from daily life.
With an empty heart and non-action,
the Dao naturally abides.
But scholars often seek esoteric wonders,
pursuing what lies beyond the void—
the more they seek, the more distant they grow.
When all is stripped away and returned to its origin,
the Dao’s essence remains whole—
what need for duality?

A kingdom is a metaphor for the body,
its people for the vital qi.
How could one not know this?"*

The ancient text reads thus, and later passages confirm that knowing this proves the ruin of the realm.

The Heavenly Gate—through it all things and transformations enter and exit. The sun opens, the moon closes, and through this the divine functions are manifested. The Sage expounds this Dao in secret, taking *yin* stillness as the foundation. Thus, when the principles are illuminated, responding to things requires no effort, and one attains perfect clarity and boundless understanding.

How could one fail to recognize this?

The ancient text reads thus, but the vulgar *He Shang* version alters "love the people" to "non-action," and "clear and bright" to "without knowledge"—directly contradictory. "Without doing" is akin to "without purpose." Fearful that cleverness would obstruct the Dao, the teaching thus advocates non-action.

All above pertains to cultivating the self.

Now one must take nurturing life as the heart.

To give birth without claiming its merit,
to act without relying on its strength—
settled yet expansive,
not lording over others with tyrannical pride—
this is called the profound and wondrous virtue beyond mortal comprehension.

The *Niu Miao* Transmission says:
*"Carrying the spirit-soul, embracing the One—
how could one stray from it?"*

*Carrying* means "repeatedly."
*Camp* means "life."
*Po* means "moon."
*Embracing the One* refers to the moon’s first emergence.

When the *po* dissipates, it is called the moon’s end.
When *po* carries *ying*, it is called the moon’s unity.

Indeed, at the moon’s birth, there is but a single point of luminosity.
If one clings to it, it gradually grows until full and radiant.
Thus observed, even the moon cannot depart from that single point of light, always embracing it—
how much more so for all else?

This is the art of nurturing the subtle to achieve the manifest,
from one to myriad things.

The One is the Dao.
All things under heaven—what does not arise from this Dao?

Confucius said:
*"The Dao is never to be abandoned, even for a moment."*

When a person has the Dao, they live.
When they lack it, they die.
"Live" and "die" depend solely on whether one can embrace the One or not.

Can one concentrate the qi and attain supreme softness,
as an infant does?

*Specialization* is *oneness*.
*Qi* is the body’s fullness.
Truly, between heaven and earth, what sustains life and breath
is nothing but qi.

The so-called "infant brother" retains pristine nature,
untainted by human desires.
As one grows, however, external stimuli stir the mind,
and desires gradually arise,
corrupting the innate pure heart.
Thus, internally, preferences and aversions become unchecked,
while externally, sounds and colors ensnare the senses—
from this, decline naturally follows.

If a person unifies their will
and does not violently disrupt their qi,
their body becomes harmonious and supple,
light and vigorous—
like an infant or maiden.

*Liezi* said:
*"An infant’s qi is concentrated, its will unified—
the pinnacle of harmony.
Nothing harms it,
and no virtue surpasses it."*

This is what is meant.

「Purge and illuminate the Dao/Way—
could there be any flaw?

*Purge* is cleansing.
*Except* is removing.
*Playen* is the Dao/Way.
*Lan* is observation.
*Flaw* is blemish, meaning error.

Speaking of the Dao/Way for humanity,
it requires constant cleansing of body and mind,
removal of external distractions,
and observing the subtleties of the Dao/Way,
so that one may become a person who exhausts principles and fulfills nature*—*
between heaven and earth,
they can avoid great errors.
How could they be called flawed?

The vulgar speak of the "Heavenly Heart" as a mirror—
without cleansing, it cannot be clear;
the Dao/Way is like a shadow—
without observation, it cannot be seen.

Thus, the Dao/Way scholar always cultivates and reflects,
without any interruption,
so that their *virtue/power* remains luminous
and is not obscured by cravings.

Like a person bathing once a day—
or bathing daily,
never ceasing their bathing,
if their cleansing and purifying rituals are uninterrupted,
then their body remains pristine and clear,
not stained by past impurities,
and their mirror reflects without dust,
their heart illuminates the Dao/Way.

This is the meaning of *purge and illuminate the Dao/Way*.

Loving the people and governing the state—
could there be any *action/doing*?

Truly, the people are the foundation of the state;
if the foundation is secure, the state is at peace.
Thus, one who governs the state must first love the people,
and the way to love the people is through *non-action*.
*Non-action* means not to obstruct.

As in the past, when Tang Taizong once told his attendants:
*"The ruler depends on the state,
the state depends on the people.
If you exploit the people to serve the ruler,
it is like cutting flesh to fill the belly.
The belly may be full while the body dies,
the ruler may grow rich while the state perishes.
Thus, the ruler’s misfortune does not come from without,
but arises from within."*

Afterward, he lightened taxes and burdens,
selected capable officials.
From then on, the empire flourished in peace,
people had abundant clothing and food,
outer doors remained open,
and travelers lodged freely in the wilds.
Is this not the saying of loving the people and governing the state
through *non-action* and non-obstruction?

The opening and closing of the *Heavenly Gate*—
could there be any imbalance?

The *Heavenly Gate* is the mouth.
Truly, the mouth is the gateway of the body—
the head round as heaven,
so the mouth is called the *Heavenly Gate*.

*Opening and closing* refers to breathing,
*imbalance* means the lack of harmony between yin and yang.

Truly, opening and closing,
breathing,
yin and yang—
these refer to *dynamic and static*.
*Dynamic and static* are the interplay of movement and stillness.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
*"One dynamic, one static—
mutually their roots.
One yin, one yang—
this is called the Dao/Way.
Those who follow it are good."*

Who could have inhalation without exhalation?
Who could have stillness without movement?
Thus, it is said: *The Heavenly Gate opens and closes—*
could there be any imbalance?

*The True Definition Scripture* states:
*"Two movements constitute yin,
one stillness constitutes yang.
Yang alone brings variation,
yin alone maintains constancy.
Understanding constancy and awakening to clarity,
embracing unity and resonating with the spirit*—*
the interplay of *kan* and *li* is fixed,
transformation and change occur naturally."*

This discusses the balance of yin and yang,
movement and stillness.
Thus, it is said: *The Heavenly Gate opens and closes—*
could there be any imbalance?

Clear and penetrating, fourfold and boundless—
could there be any ignorance?

*Clear* means keen perception.
*White* means bright sensitivity.
*Boundless* means thoroughness.

A person with keen perception and bright sensitivity,
whose understanding is fourfold and boundless,
can know the world without stepping outside their door,
can see the Dao/Way without peering through windows.
Who would call them ignorant?

*Knowledge* means the ability to perceive the four directions,
consult the four cardinal officials,
and understand the four kinds of people.
Only a ruler who is clear and boundless
can truly know them.

As with Yao’s opening of the four gates,
illuminating the four eyes,
and attuning the four ears—
this is the case.

A ruler of the world,
using the four directions’ ears as their own,
not hoarding their ears,
can thus communicate the world’s intentions
and grasp the world’s emotions.

Using the four directions’ eyes as their own,
not hoarding their eyes,
then the world’s clarity becomes their own clarity.
Thus, their vision is never unreflective,
their hearing is never unperceptive.
Who would call them ignorant?
This is the meaning of *clear and boundless*.

To nurture and sustain life—
to generate without possessing generation,
to sustain without claiming credit for nurturing.
*Not possessing* means not taking ownership of the deed.

Take heaven and earth, for instance—
they generate all things,
yet all things never claim it as heaven’s and earth’s work.
Take the sage, for instance—
the sage nurtures the world with benevolence,
yet the world never credits it as the sage’s favor.
It is not that heaven and earth have no work,
nor that the sage offers no benefits—
their deeds are profound yet unmanifest,
their benefits vast yet unapparent.
Thus, they receive the work without knowing its source,
they accept the benefits without feeling gratitude.

Here, we see the grandeur of heaven, earth, and the sage.
If heaven, earth, and the sage had boasted of their work,
then it would not be called *generating without possessing*.

The *Scripture* says: *"Heaven and earth lack virtue/power,"*
and again: *"The sage lacks virtue/power."*
This is the saying of *generating without possessing*.

To act without relying—
this is what is called *Playen Virtue/Power*.

The sage is the most noble among people,
yet they never rely on their nobility.
Truly, the sage governs the world and directs customs,
transforming alone in the *Dao/Way’s* shaping*—*
they do not cling to lowly words,
nor do they seize the common level of the multitude,
thus they act without relying,
they grow without harvesting.
Yet the sage never claims their own nobility,
nor do they ever fail to follow the sage’s virtue/power.

The greater they are, the smaller they seem;
the higher they rise, the lower they appear;
the clearer they become, the more obscure they are—
this is how they become sage.
Thus, it is called *Playen Virtue/Power*.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
*"Modest, modest, the noble person—
humble to cultivate themselves."*
Is this not the same meaning?

Yang Zhiren said:
*"To sustain the spirit*—
this is what is called *Playen Virtue/Power*.
The *spirit* refers to *hun* and *po*—
these must be nurtured.
Excessive joy or anger harms the *hun*,
excessive fright or terror harms the *po*.
Peace and tranquility extend longevity."*

The human body is like a boat, a raft, or a dwelling—
it must contain the *hun* to nurture and guard the *po*,
so they may return to unity, never to be parted even for a moment.

To act outwardly is to embody *De* (virtue/power),
to spread inwardly is to manifest *De*—
this is called singularity without division.

Let the *qi* be soft and harmonious,
embracing purity and guarding it,
so that one’s nature is like an infant’s longing for its tender mother,
or a babe yet unspoiled by the world.

Wash away the filth of the heart,
untainted by even a speck of dust—
both good and evil vanish,
mind and intention dissolve.

Hide your vessel and await its time.

To love the people and govern the realm
is but an extension of cultivating oneself.
He who governs his body by cherishing his *qi* preserves his life,
he who governs the state by loving his people secures its peace.

The true nature of such a person shines luminous and clear,
pure and unblemished—
within, it is radiant and transparent;
without, it appears as simple as the unlearned.

*Heaven* is one’s innate nature.
*The Gate* refers to the opening and closing [of *qi*].

The enlightened see all paths as open—
Heaven’s light is never without the radiance of sun and moon,
while human enlightenment is the singular, undivided nature.

Yet there are those who remain ignorant and obscured.
*The Classic of Changes* says:
*"To close the door is called *Kun* (Earth),
to open the door is called *Qian* (Heaven).
Opening and closing is called *change*,
forward and backward without end is called *communication*.
The theory of *sheng-chu* (nourishing life) generates yin and yang
and preserves the utmost essence—
from non-being arises being."*

To act without self-reliance,
to grow without domination—
this is the subtlety of *Playen Virtue/Power*.

*The Doctrine of the Mean* states:
*"The noble person honors innate virtue/power
and follows the Way of inquiry and learning,
realizing the vast and exhausting the subtle,
attaining the highest clarity while embodying the Middle Way.
Revering tradition while knowing the new,
cultivating sincerity to uphold propriety—
thus, though in high station, they are not proud,
though in low station, they do not rebel.
When the state has the Way, their words suffice to revive it.
When the state lacks the Way, their silence suffices to contain it."*

*The Odes* say:
*"Both wise and enlightened,
they preserve themselves thus."*
Is this not what is meant?

Yù Qīngzhōng said:
*"To sustain the *hun* and *po* is what is called *Playen Virtue/Power*."*

Fū Qí Línshì said:
*"*Hun* is the soul, the spirit.
*Po* is the vital essence, the *qi*.
These three characters hold the profound meaning of *Laozi*.
*Load* is like a cart bearing goods—
placing *load* above and *hun* and *po* below,
it is like a riddle.
If *po* bears the *hun*, it becomes the common person;
if *hun* bears the *po*, it becomes the sage.
Together, they are one;
separately, they are two.
*Embrace* means to unite—
if one can always unite and make them one,
the true essence will not scatter.
Otherwise, unity is lost.
Thus, *Laozi* sternly warns:
*'Can one truly avoid separation?*
This is like the precept in the *Sutra of the Ten Wholesome Actions*—
one must hold fast to *non-doing*.'"

Only the sage retains the heart of the infant.
The infant’s heart is innate knowing and innate capacity—
its *qi* is still and focused,
yet gentle and yielding—
this is to say, it does not violently exhaust its *qi*.
Thus, it unites and makes them one.

Purifying falsehoods, gazing into the mysterious—
how could there be any flaws to point out?

To govern the state and love the people,
one must be like Emperor Wen—
personally cultivating silent stillness,
transmitting the *Yellow Emperor-Laozi* tradition of pure tranquility.
Beyond this lies only the toil of artificial action.

The opening and closing of the *Heavenly Gate*
is the passage for the circulation of vital essence.
When pure yang prevails, it is the receptive yin.
Can one truly avoid the yin?
It is only a concern that yin *qi* might overpower it.

Though all paths are clear and open,
true understanding lies not in prying scrutiny.
Nurture and cultivate—
life’s vitality flows naturally,
yet one does not claim its merit;
things are accomplished effortlessly,
yet one does not rely on one’s strength.

The *Dao-heart* eternally governs the body,
without the labor of controlling all movements—
this is called the profound and mysterious virtue/power.

This chapter speaks of the practice of cultivating mind and nature,
within which lie the methods for governing the state and loving the people.
*Laozi* exhorts the rulers of his time to govern through natural *wuwei*,
thus issuing warnings like *"Can one truly avoid..."*—
all are words of admonition.

Since the Three Dynasties, only Emperor Wen understood this.

Speaking of the *Heavenly Gate*—
it is the gate of the Purple Palace at the North Celestial Pole.
Heaven has the North Star within the Purple Palace,
and within the palace, the Five Emperors reign in succession.
Thus, the Gate opens and closes—
when open, it is *Tai* (harmony);
when closed, it is *Pi* (obstruction).
Hence, in spring, the Green Emperor’s Gate opens,
while the others remain closed.
The example of the four seasons is such—
perhaps another interpretation exists.

Now, I preserve both.

「Xú Liùxū said: *"Carrying the vital essence and embracing unity—can one truly avoid separation?"*

A person’s form carries soul and vital essence,
just as a carriage carries goods.
The scripture speaks of *yíngpò* (vital essence) rather than *húnpò* (soul and vital essence),
for the soul governs movement—
movement is the capacity to vitalize and regulate all things.
Hence, it is called *yíngpò* (vital essence).

The *Nèiguān Jīng* (Scripture of Inner Observation) states:
*"Movement that vitalizes the body is called the soul;
stillness that steadies the form is called the vital essence."*
To *"embrace unity and avoid separation"* is not to seek a separate *one* to hold,
so that it does not depart.
It refers to the dual meanings of soul and vital essence diverging—
the soul wanders and shifts without constancy,
while the vital essence remains fixed and unyielding.
Thus, the teaching is to hold them as one,
so that soul and vital essence suffer no fault of deviation.
If so, then in movement, they are one;
in stillness, they are one.
Wherever one goes, it is not separate from this unity—
how could there be any separation?

To concentrate *qi* and cultivate softness—
can one attain the state of an infant?
When *jing* (essence) is concentrated and *qi* is vast,
reaching the utmost in softness and harmony—
like an infant, who throughout the day
knows nothing and recognizes nothing,
pure and complete, unspoiled and unspoiled,
*qi* concentrated, mind unified,
bones frail, sinews soft, yet grasp firm.

To purify and survey the mysteries—
can one remain without flaw?
*Purification* means washing away one’s cravings and desires;
*removal* means eliminating one’s likes and dislikes.
*Mysteries* are Heaven;
*survey* is illumination.
When cravings and desires are extinguished,
Heaven’s light naturally shines forth.
To illuminate the true source—
if one can make it so that not a single flaw remains,
then it is well.
*Flaw* is *disease*.
If even a single point is not cleansed,
it becomes the root of the disease of confusion across lifetimes.

The above three passages speak of the essentials
for advancing one’s aspiration toward the Dao.

The following discusses the ruler’s love for the people
and the Way of governing the state.
To love the people and govern the state—
can one truly avoid *wuwei* (inaction)?

To love the people and govern the state
are two distinct matters.
One speaks of *wuwei* (inaction)—
for if a ruler loves the people through *wuwei*,
the people will be at ease;
if a ruler governs the state through *wuwei*,
the state will be tranquil.
*Wuwei* (inaction) is not passive silence or idle sitting—
it means to benefit the people by what benefits them,
so that love is vast;
to govern the state by what the state requires,
so that governance is grand.
This is true *wuwei*.

The *Tōng Xuān Jīng* (Scripture of Penetrating the Mysterious) says:
*"Wuwei* means not acting before things have acted themselves."
It also says:
*"To follow is great; to act is petty."
If one seeks to love the people with small favors,
or to govern the state with harsh laws and punishments,
then it is petty.

As for the *Heavenly Gate* opening and closing—
can one truly avoid *cī* (passivity/femininity)?
The *Heavenly Gate* is the great root of all under Heaven,
the source from which auspiciousness and inauspiciousness,
order and chaos arise—
the natural doorway of creation and transformation.
The Dao has its passages of flow and blockage;
time has its *pǐ* (obstruction) and *tài* (harmony).
This is the natural principle of creation and transformation.
Just as doors and gates are opened and closed,
their timing cannot be measured.
The wise dwell in *cī* (passivity) and stillness,
awaiting its course—
then nothing will fail to be good.
Otherwise, they act as *xióng* (masculine/forceful) or as leaders,
and often see disaster.

To be clear and open in all directions—
can one truly avoid *zhī* (knowing)?
A ruler is intelligent, well-informed, and knows all things—
clear and open in every direction.
If one can conceal one’s knowledge,
entrusting it to the worthy while receiving their abilities,
upright and dignified, with sleeves drawn low,
then the state is governed without laboring the mind,
longevity is extended, and all under Heaven is in harmony.
To nurture and preserve life until it reaches its utmost—
then it is not slaughtered.
A ruler tends to the people,
letting them live and nourish themselves naturally,
content in tranquility—
thus, it is said to nurture and preserve life.
Though lenient and forgiving,
it is because of their natural growth and sustenance—
one does not claim credit for it.
Above and below forget each other,
the people receive their blessings—
thus, it is said to give life without possession.
All actions undertaken,
without exception, are to benefit all under Heaven.
When the work is accomplished and the affairs fulfilled,
one does not claim them as one’s own—
thus, it is said to act without reliance.
The ruler is the leader of all the people.
As the leader of the people,
yet issuing no commands to slaughter them—
the people know only of their ruler.
Thus, it is said: *"Comfortably at ease"*—
hence, *"long while not slaughtered."*
This is called *Xuān Dé* (Mysterious Virtue).
*Xuān* is Heaven.
If a ruler cultivates himself thus,
it is called *"harmonizing with Heaven’s virtue."*

Chái Yuángāo said:
*"To carry the vital essence"*—
the body carries the vital essence, just as a carriage carries goods.
The vital essence perceives likes and disturbs the body—
one must be cautious in carrying it,
constantly guarding against its overturning.
*"To embrace unity and avoid separation"*—
the mind does not split its focus,
so that the *Gǔshén* (Vital Spirit of the Valleys) remains active.
*"To concentrate qi and attain softness"*—
*qi* does not disperse through the nose,
so that *tāixī* (womb-breathing) is complete.
*"To purify and survey the mysteries"*—
the spirit does not leak through the eyes,
so that wisdom and resolve are perfected.

*"To love the people and govern the state"*—
the ruler is not enslaved by physical form,
so that sinews and bones grow strong.

*"The Heavenly Gate opens and closes"*—
if opening and closing proceed without interruption,
then one does not depart from the Mother.

*"To be clear and open in all directions"*—
if essence and *qi* do not leak from cleverness,
then the mind’s perception is profound.

*"To nurture and preserve life"*—
to excel in preservation and nourishment.
*"To give life without possession"* is the utmost called *Xuān Dé* (Mysterious Virtue).
If one constantly preserves its essence
and regulates its use,
then one’s virtues are not vainglorious
while the vital essence is secure—
thus, the cultivation of a sage’s virtue is achieved.

Sū Jìng said:
*"From ‘carrying the vital essence’ to ‘this is called Mysterious Virtue.’*
This chapter’s original intent by *Laozi*
lies solely in *"giving life without possession,"*
*"acting without reliance,"*
and *"long while not slaughtered."*
Yet the emphasis is placed on
*"carrying the vital essence and embracing unity"* as the topic.
*Yíng* means *dwelling*;
*Pò* means *qi*.
*Soul* is *spirit*.
To *"carry"* is like a carriage carrying goods;
*"yíng"* is like *enfolding*.
The vital essence dwells within the body,
though the soul’s movements
are always followed by the vital essence—
just as goods are carried in a carriage when moving.
This is the unification of soul and vital essence.
The soul and vital essence should be united as one,
not separated into two.
If separated into two,
there may be soul without vital essence,
or vital essence without soul—
the person is no longer a person and dies.

*Laozi* thus sets forth analogies,
speaking of the five matters of soul and vital essence embracing unity.
An infant is pure, unified, soft, and good—
its *qi* is concentrated, its softness extreme.
*Extreme* means *ultimate.*»

Thus, one may make the soul and vital essence unite without separation—
this is *purity and firmness*.

To purify flaws and remove defilements, to gaze into the profound and obscure,
is to seek out faults and blemishes.
But if one purifies and gazes without seeking faults,
then the soul and vital essence may unite without separation—
this is *non-attachment*.

To love the people and govern the state while acting through *wuwei* (non-action),
then clarity and stillness arise naturally,
and the soul and vital essence may unite without separation—
this is *purity and clarity*.

The opening and closing of the *Heavenly Gate*,
through which *Heavenly Principle* emerges—
when *yin* and *yang* interact in harmony,
when *male* and *female* resonate together,
with principle present yet the mind absent,
then the soul and vital essence unite without separation—
this is *desirelessness*.

To be bright and far-reaching yet appear as if without knowledge or awareness,
then one conceals brilliance in obscurity,
and the soul and vital essence may unite without separation—
this is *concealing brilliance*.

In essence, *purity and firmness*, *non-attachment*, *purity and clarity*,
*desirelessness*, and *concealing brilliance*—
these five make the soul and vital essence naturally embrace unity.
When the soul and vital essence embrace unity,
they become the source of *generative life*.

*Heaven’s Dao* takes nurturing all things as its intent,
yet especially cherishes humanity.
To give birth and nourish is *Heaven’s Dao*,
yet if the soul and vital essence separate,
life cannot endure.
*Laozi* teaches these five matters to humanity,
while *Heaven and Earth’s* benevolent generation is boundless.
Yet *Heaven’s Dao* gives birth without possessing—
how could it claim credit for its generative power?
It acts without relying—
how could it boast of its deeds?
Though it stands as sovereign over all things,
it harbors no masterful intent—
this is called the *mysterious virtue*.

To take the unity of soul and vital essence as the root of generative life,
and to possess without claiming, act without relying, govern without dominating,
is to have no room for the mind.
The grace of giving birth and nourishing
is shared equally by *Heaven* and the *Sage*—
thus speaks *Ben Yi An*, the recluse of the *One Root Lodge*:
*"From ‘carrying the vital essence and soul’ to this point is called the *Mysterious Virtue*."*

The meaning of *soul* and *vital essence* has been thoroughly expounded by earlier scholars.
In my view, regarding the *Rites’* sacrificial rites, *Confucius* said:
*"The vital essence is the flourishing of the spirit."*
*Zheng Xuan* annotated:
*"The vital essence is the luminous clarity of the ears and eyes."*
This is the most concise explanation.
*Zhu Xi* said that *vital essence* (*ying*) is akin to *ying* (glowing),
meaning radiant brilliance—
thus, *vital essence* and *soul* are the spiritual essence of the form.
Human form gives rise to spirit,
and the luminous clarity of the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth
all originate from *One Nature*—
what the *Buddhist School* calls *Elemental Essence*.
It divides into the six harmonized faculties from a single clarity—
yet because it is drawn by external things,
it drifts and forgets its return,
thus the form decays externally while awareness falters internally,
and suddenly, death comes.
The soul ascends, the vital essence descends—
they can no longer reunite.
To die without forgetting is difficult indeed.

Thus, the enlightened one gathers vision and returns hearing,
reverses light to illuminate the source,
and restores the origin of *One Nature*.
*"Carrying"* means dwelling steadfast without scattering.
*"Embracing"* means preserving unity without loss.
*One* refers to *Nature*—
what the *Buddhist School* calls *Returning the Flow to Wholeness*,
where the six faculties do not act,
and clarity does not follow the roots—
this is *illuminating the root and emitting light*.
To illuminate the root and emit light is to *carry the vital essence and soul*.
To return the flow to wholeness is to *embrace unity without separation*.
This is the essential path to *restoring Nature and embodying form*—
not merely the true cultivation of refining form and spirit for longevity and sharp vision.

*Specialization* means *unmixed*.
*Extreme* means *ultimate*.
An infant, untempted by knowledge or thought to disturb its *qi*,
thus its *qi* is *specialized*.
Unburdened by competition between self and other to harm its softness,
thus its softness is *extreme*.
Though humans may strive to maintain gentle *qi*,
they can manage it temporarily but not perpetually—
only as an infant is it truly *extreme*.
These two aspects both return to the beginning of life,
and only through purification and profound contemplation
does the divine attain its ultimate function.
For purification removes dust and defilement—
truly, the original clarity emerges from this.
If even a speck of external filth remains unexhausted,
then wisdom is obscured;
if even a hair’s breadth of imperfection lingers,
only purification can resolve it—
until the mind and eyes become luminously clear,
then one perceives all things with penetrating vision.
The pure remain pure,
the impure become pure—
no selection, no perception of flaws—
this is *ultimate*.

Having perfected self-cultivation thus,
one extends it to govern the world and respond to affairs,
loving the people and ruling the state—
this is the norm.
The opening and closing of the *Heavenly Gate*—
this is its transformation.
As the *Yijing* says:
*"One closing, one opening—this is called transformation."*
To be *female* is to be harmonious without initiating,
to follow without leading—
in its constancy, there is no trace of action.
In its response to change, there is no intent to precede things.
For there is neither anticipation nor resistance—
one simply abides in natural ease.

To be bright and far-reaching yet appear without knowledge,
this is called *"wise and insightful, yet guarded by simplicity."*
To give birth and nourish is *virtue*.
To give birth without possessing,
to act without relying,
to lead without dominating—
this is *virtue* without the mind of *virtue*—
this is the *mysterious virtue* of *virtue*.

*Laozi’s* this chapter #2
encompasses the *Dao* of governing the body and the state.

*Lu Yu* of *Shi Yi* says:
*"‘Carrying’ originates from *Heaven*—
the beginning of the discourse."*
*Shi Tan* says:
*"Carrying the vital essence and soul, embracing unity—
how could they separate?"*
*Vital essence*, in ancient annotations, is taken as *soul*.
For the *soul* is the moon’s luminosity,
the *vital essence* is the moon’s shadow.
The moon receives sunlight to become luminous,
the shadow must carry the luminosity to live without dying.
*Embracing unity* means the vital essence and soul merge as one,
never separating.
To specialize *qi* and achieve ultimate softness,
one must be like an infant.
Humans are endowed with form and *qi* to live,
yet when *yang qi* flourishes uncontrollably,
it cannot be self-regulated and inevitably drifts,
losing its true essence.
Only by specializing and guarding one’s *qi*,
making it soft as an infant—
though it may move, it does not know the union of *male* and *female*—
is this well done.
This aligns with the later text:
*"The depth of virtue is compared to that of an infant."*

To purify and gaze profoundly,
one must be without blemish.
The ancients said:
*"The mind perceives all things,
easily moved by external influences—
thus, one must purify external desires,
leaving no trace of flaw or defect."*

「To cherish the people and govern the state,
one must attain *wuwei* [無為].

The ancient commentary states:
*"For those who cultivate the body, cherishing the *qi* ensures bodily integrity;
for those who govern the people, cherishing the people ensures the state’s security."
This encompasses both meanings.

To attain *wuwei* in terms of cultivating the body,
it means the *Way* [道] is applied without excessive effort—
as seen in the previous chapter.
In terms of governing the people,
it is the *Way* of *"governing through non-action"* [無為而治].

However, the *Master of the Yellow River* [河上公] rendered it as *"without knowing"* [無知],
which aligns with the following passage.
Yet, *"without knowing"* [無知] should be interpreted as *"without acting"* [無為].
The *Heavenly Gate* [天門] opens and closes,
yet remains *without female* [無雌]—i.e., *without clinging to passivity*.
As *Program Tai* [程泰] explains:
*"Zhuangzi* [莊子] designated the realm of birth and death,
the emergence and disappearance of all things,
as the *Heavenly Gate* [天門].
*Female* [雌] here signifies tranquil stillness and yielding weakness—
one who embodies *female* [雌] does not boast of their power,
though *yin* and *yang* [陰陽] may give rise to all things.
This reflects the principle of *"giving birth without possession"* [生而不有].

To be *bright and all-pervading* [明白四達] yet *without knowing* [無知],
this heart, though aware of all things,
never seeks to grasp that knowledge—
the *Way* of *"without thinking yet knowing"* [不思而得],
*"without deliberation yet aware"* [不虑而知].

To bring forth and nurture all things,
to give birth without possession,
to act without claiming merit,
to grow without controlling—
this is called *mysterious virtue* [玄德].

The preceding passages on *loading the Vital Essence* [載營], *specializing and softening the *qi*** [專氣致柔],
and *purifying and profound vision* [涤除玄覽]
focus solely on cultivating the body.

*Cherishing the people and governing the state* [愛民治國],
*the Heavenly Gate opening and closing* [天門開闔],
and *brightness and all-pervasiveness* [明白四達]
extend these principles to all things.

This passage summarizes the three preceding lines:
*"To bring forth and nurture all things,
each attains their place naturally,
yet none know the reason why—
this is called *mysterious virtue* [玄德].*
This aligns with the saying:
*"The common people do not know the power of the Sovereign"* [百姓不知帝力].

*Mysterious Virtue* [玄德] *of the Daoist and Moral Classic* [道德真經] *Volume 16 concludes.*

#1 *Lost in the Way* [失之道哉]: Likely a miscopy, intended as *"The Way of Heaven* [天之道哉]".
#2 *In this chapter of Laozi* [老子此章]: A character is missing below this line; likely *"cultivate"* [修] or *"nurture"* [養].

*Mysterious Virtue* [玄德] *of the Daoist and Moral Classic* [道德真經] *Volume 17 begins with the Master of Concentrated Distance* [凝遠大師] *on the Path of Eternal Virtue* [常德路] *and the Profound Observation of the Mysterious* [玄妙觀].

**Thirty-Spoke Chapter [三十辐章]**
*Critical Notes:*
The *Riverbank Master* [河上公] composed the *"Chapter of the Useful in Non-Use"* [无用章],
while *Zhào Shí’ān* authored the *"Hidden and Manifest Illuminating Meaning"* [隐显玄彰义章].

**Emperor Xuānzōng’s Commentary [唐明皇疏]:**
The preceding chapter expounds nurturing the spirit and cherishing *qi*, unadulterated—thus without blemish.
This chapter elucidates the utility of *non-use* and the efficacy of *use*, their mutual reliance establishing function.
Thus, *Heaven* [乾] and *Earth* [坤] are the profound essence of the *Great Transformation* [大易],
and the *yoke and axle* [辕厢] embody the substance of *non-use*.
They are likened to *vehicles, vessels, and chambers*—
their efficacy lies in the interplay of *having* and *non-having*.

**Du Guāngtíng’s Explanation:**
Cherishing *qi* and nurturing the spirit upholds *tranquility*.
The utility of *non-use* and the efficacy of *use* lie in their mutual reliance—
taking from what exists while leveraging what is absent.

The three—*vehicles, vessels, and chambers*—
all borrow their *having* to exploit their *non-having* for function.
*Vehicles* convey, *vessels* contain, *chambers* shelter—
the mind relies on external *having* while harnessing internal *non-having*,
thus accomplishing the efficacy of *use*.

*Heaven* and *Earth* are the foundation of the *Great Transformation* [大易],
as stated in the *"Systematic Transmission"* [□系辞].
The *Great Transformation*’s establishment originates from *Heaven* and *Earth*.
Without *Heaven* and *Earth*, the *Dao* would have no foundation.
Thus, *Heaven* and *Earth* are the root and repository of the *Dao*,
like rivers and granaries storing its depths.
Hence, it is said: *"When *Heaven* and *Earth* align, the *Great Transformation* stands within."*

If *Heaven* and *Earth* are destroyed, the *Great Transformation* cannot manifest.
This is akin to the *wheel-hub* and *yoke-axle*—
if the *yoke-axle* is ruined, the *vehicle* cannot exist.
To illustrate the principle of *utility*, three analogies are given.

For governing the realm: if the people perish, the state collapses;
if the people scatter, the state falters.
For cultivating the self: if the spirit departs, life ends;
if the spirit dissipates, the body perishes.
The *Dao* of *utility* truly depends on mutual reliance.

**Zhāng Chōngyìng’s Interpretation:**
*Non-use* is *emptiness*—
if *qi* were not empty, it could not circulate and transform into spirit.
Thus, it is called *"non-use."*

Thirty spokes converge at one hub—
its *emptiness* yields the *vehicle*’s function.
*Clay molded into vessels*—
its *emptiness* yields the *vessel*’s function.
*Doors and windows carved for chambers*—
its *emptiness* yields the *chamber*’s function.
Thus, *having* provides *utility*, while *non-having* enables *use*.

**Riverbank Master’s Explanation:**
Thirty spokes converge at one hub—
ancient *vehicles* had thirty spokes, following the lunar cycle’s count.
They converge at the hub because its *emptiness* allows them to unite.
For cultivating the self, one must purge emotions and desires,
leaving the five *zàng*-organs empty—
thus the spirit returns.
For governing the state, few leaders unite many subjects,
making the strong serve the weak.
When *emptiness* prevails, the *vehicle*’s function emerges.
*Emptiness* means *void*—
the hub’s void allows movement;
the *zàng*-organs’ void permits bearing burdens.

*Clay molded into vessels*—
*Bié* (harmonizing) and *zhì* (earth) form drinking and eating utensils.
Their *emptiness* yields their function—
the vessel’s void allows containment.

*Doors and windows carved for chambers*—
referring to constructed dwellings.
Their *emptiness* yields their function—
doors and windows’ void permits entry and exit;
the chamber’s void permits residence.
Thus, *having* provides *utility*—
benefiting form and function,
fearing the vessel’s collapse or the body’s decay.
*Non-having* enables *use*—
only the void can contain all things.
Thus, *"emptiness governs the formed."*

The *Dao* is *emptiness*.
**Wáng Fǔsì’s Statement:**
From *thirty spokes* to the *vehicle*’s function—
the hub’s *emptiness* unifies the spokes,
allowing the solid to govern the many.
From *clay molded into vessels* to *non-having* as *use*—
wood and clay form walls,
yet all rely on *emptiness* for function.
Thus, *non-having* is the foundation of *having*’s *utility*.

**Emperor Xuānzōng’s Further Explanation:**
From *thirty spokes* to the *vehicle*’s function—
this demonstrates how *having* and *non-having*’s efficacy relies on mutual support.
Thirty spokes converge at one hub,
illustrating how the few govern the many.
The *yoke-axle*’s *having* forms the *vehicle*,
while the *vehicle*’s *emptiness* enables movement.
Without the *yoke-axle*’s *having*, there would be no *vehicle* to utilize.
If the *vehicle* were not empty, the *yoke-axle*’s *having* would be useless.

**Commentary:**
Thirty spokes pierce one hub—
the few govern the many.
When empty, the *vehicle*’s movement is realized—
*non-having* benefits *having*.
What is the *Dao*?
It is the ultimate *emptiness*, the ultimate *oneness*.
Thus, it moves and nurtures all things,
commanding myriad materials,
making ten thousand distinctions coalesce—
all from a single *image*.
All orifices resonate as one sound when struck—
the origin of all underheaven’s movement and transformation
never departs from ultimate *emptiness* and *oneness*.

Even in *vehicles*:
the *yoke-axle* has substance, while the *vehicle*’s interior is empty.
The *vehicle*’s emptiness allows movement.
Without the *yoke-axle*’s substance, the *vehicle*’s function ceases.
If the *vehicle* were not empty, the *yoke-axle*’s parts would be discarded.

Thus, when *Heaven* and *Earth* align, the *Great Transformation*’s efficacy is manifest;
when ten thousand transformations flow, the *Dao*’s utility shines.
Hence, through coarse analogies of *non-use*,
the utility of ultimate *emptiness* is illuminated.

*Clay molded into vessels*—
when empty, they serve their function.
*Bié* (harmonizing) and *zhì* (earth)—
potters blend earth to form *wǎ* (vessels).
**Commentary:**
*Bié* means *harmonizing*; *zhì* is *adhesive clay*.
The annotation cites the *Shàngshū*: *"Molding earth is called *táo*."*

「This speaks of the potter shaping and blending adhesive clay, then firing it to become vessels—
it is the inner void that allows them to hold and receive things.

Carving doors and windows yields the function of a dwelling.
Ancients dug caves for shelter, also opening doors and windows,
hence the phrase *"carve thus"* (凿尔).
**Commentary:**
*Carve* (凿) means *to excavate*.
Windows (牖) are side chambers or openings near doors.
The ancients dwelled in caves, so the *Shijing* says:
*"The potter digs and covers the cave,"*
meaning he excavates the earth within the cave and covers it above—
thus *"carve thus"* (凿尔).

Later sages replaced this with official halls,
taking their inner void as the means for people to dwell.
*Zhuangzi* says:
*"If a dwelling has no void, mother-in-law and sister-in-law will jostle for passage,"*
meaning they will fight over narrow paths.
*The Erya* states:
*"The hall is called a dwelling."*
Thus, having form is for utility,
while emptiness is for discarding.
Having form profits from emptiness,
using emptiness for profit;
emptiness relies on form,
using form for function.

What transcends form is called *Dao*,
what is beneath form is called *instrument*.
To reveal the *Dao*’s function,
it is clarified through form and substance.
Thus, by borrowing the coarse utility of having form to illustrate
the subtle function of ultimate emptiness—

**Commentary:**
The profit of having form lies in its utility,
while utility itself depends on emptiness,
so having form profits from emptiness.
The function of emptiness relies on form,
while form itself depends on having substance,
so emptiness profits from having form.

The phrase *"what transcends form is called Dao, what is beneath form is called instrument"*—
this is the language of the *Yijing*’s *Xìcí Shū*.

**Commentary:**
From emptiness, it is called *Dao*;
when touching upon substance, it is called *instrument*.
To clarify the *Dao*’s function,
one must approximate it through form and instrument.
Though it borrows analogies from the three transformations,
ultimately, it relies on emptiness for one principle.

*Du Guangting* says:
*"Thirty spokes converge to form the wheel’s function.
The hub gathers all spokes to complete the wheel,
the carriage gathers all materials to fulfill its purpose.
What it uses is the carriage’s hollow interior—
its emptiness.
Without the hub and spokes,
the carriage cannot be formed.
Now that the carriage is formed,
it empties its core to carry loads,
illustrating how a sovereign internally relies on ministers’ counsel
and externally delegates the aid of feudal lords
to establish his realm—
as the thirty spokes converge into one hub.
Once the realm is established,
if he can empty his heart to embody the *Dao*,
then all under Heaven transforms harmoniously,
like the carriage’s hollow space.
Man’s body,
externally depends on the hundred limbs’ arrangement,
internally relies on the five *qi*’s balance—
like the spokes converging to form a person.
Once the body is complete,
if he can empty his heart to embody the *Dao*,
then the primal harmony subtly operates,
and longevity is achieved.
This reveals how having and emptiness mutually profit and rely upon each other.

The *Dao*’s true singularity—
no color, no sound—
all types and materials depend on it to manifest.
The moving are the five spirits (灵), fur and feathers (毛羽), scales and shells (鳞甲), and winged insects (羽虫);
the growing are grasses and trees (草木).
*Types* (类) refer to *forms*,
*materials* (材) to *substance*.
Though moving and growing forms and substances differ by myriad measures,
it is the *Dao* that nurtures and gives rise to them all.
The *Dao* is but one essence.

The scripture says:
*"In the vague and indistinct, there is an image,"*
meaning this true, pure singularity
gives birth to all forms and substances.
Though few in essence,
it is the source from which the myriad arise.

The myriad orifices—
*Zhuangzi*’s *"Qíwù Piān"* says:
*The southern gate’s Zǐ Qí said to Zǐ Yóu:*
*"The Great Block exhales *qi*—
its name is wind.
When it does not act, it is still;
when it acts, then all orifices roar and howl.
The orifices of a great tree, a hundred spans around,
resemble a nose, a mouth, ears, and a window.
When it is agitated, it makes sounds—
*whoosh*, *hiss*, *shout*, *inhale*, *wail*, *roar*.
A gentle breeze harmonizes the small orifices,
while a gusting wind harmonizes the great ones.
Thus, though the sounds of all orifices differ vastly in scale,
what stirs them is but one wind."*

Observing all under Heaven’s movement and function—
the *Yijing*’s *Xìcí* says:
*"The sage perceives the movement of all under Heaven,"*
meaning the sage possesses subtlety and mystery
to see the myriad transformations of all things,
and knows that all things’ generation and growth
derive from the pure, singular, subtle *Dao*.

Thus, it is said:
*"It never departs from ultimate emptiness and singularity."*

This further elucidates:
*"When Heaven and Earth align, the *Great Transformation*’s efficacy is manifest,"*
and illustrates how the *yoke-axle*’s substance
completes the carriage’s emptiness.

All transformations flow and function through the *Dao*’s utility.
Without the myriad transformations,
the *Dao*’s function would not be revealed—
just as the *yoke-axle* serves the carriage’s purpose,
and Heaven and Earth contain the *Yijing*’s essence.

The carriage is a common instrument,
easily seen by all.
Using it as an analogy to illustrate the subtle *Dao*,
hence it is called a *coarse analogy*.

The potter shapes clay into vessels—
when empty, they serve their purpose.
Blending earth to form vessels
also reveals how substance relies on emptiness for function.

All so-called *instruments* and *functions*,
though their forms differ by myriad measures—
large, small, square, round—
some refined, some crude,
some cheap, some precious—
their true function lies in the vessels’ inner emptiness.

The phrase *"the potter shapes clay"* (范土曰陶) is from the *Shàngshū*.
When *Shun* tilled the *Lìshān* fields,
he farmed at *Lìshān* and pottered at the *Hé*’s banks—
this is the reference.
*The Liexian Zhuan* says:
*"The potter and his disciples, Master Mén,
were all ancient potters.
They mastered the transformation of the five colors of fire
and ascended to Heaven."*

*Carving doors and windows* (凿户牖) yields the function of a dwelling.
Before dwellings existed,
the potter shaped the earth and covered it,
dug the soil and hollowed it out—
when father, son, husband, and wife dwell together, it is called a *family*.
Before there were sleeping halls or ancestral temples,
nor were there *families* or *dwellings*—
*covering* (复) means covering above the ground,
*excavating* (凿) the earth below—
all like the potter’s work.
The potter’s craft is today’s tile kilns.

The *Yijing*’s *Xìcí* says:
*"In ancient times, they dwelled in caves and lived in the wilds;
later sages replaced this with official halls."
This is derived from the *Dà Zhuàng* hexagram,
which governs the construction of halls and dwellings
during the era of cave-dwelling and wild living—
hence it is called *Dà Zhuàng*.
The *Yijing* speaks of the ancients,
meaning before halls and dwellings were built,
they only had summer nests and winter caves—
thus, halls and dwellings were created to replace them,
not that later things superseded earlier ones.»

Thus it is said, *"upper antiquity"*—
that is, the time between **Fuxi** and **Huangdi**.

*The Zhuangzi* ["Thieves and Zhi"] says that the Master spoke of the ancients,
who in summer nested in trees and in winter gathered acorns—
just as it is written.
Within the nests and caves, they took the empty spaces for dwelling.
Now, the halls and dwellings we construct also take their emptiness for habitation—
hence it is said: *"When there is no use for rooms, then there is room for use."*

*"Mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law treading each other’s paths"*—
*shè* (蹊) means a path or way,
*bó* (勃) means anger or resentment.
As in *The Zhuangzi* ["External Things"], it says:
*"When the room is not empty, paths are narrow and confined,
then mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law quarrel over the way they walk."*
A daughter-in-law should yield to her mother-in-law in harmony,
as filial piety and respect demand.
Yet now they quarrel and rage over the path—
this is because the room is narrow and confined,
with no space for private movement,
so they clash and fight instead.
This is called: *"When rooms are narrow and not empty,
mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law quarrel over the path."*

When the heart is clogged and not empty,
then desires and cravings assail it in turn.
*The Er Ya* says:
*"Palaces are called *shì* (室), and rooms are called *gōng* (宫).*
Their sizes differ in construction."
Now, rites have been diminished and reduced—
the dwelling of the sage is called a *gōng* (palace),
while common dwellings are called *jiāshè* (houses), *wūyǔ* (halls), *tángshì* (chambers and rooms), etc.
As the *Lunyu* commentary by **Huang Kan** explains:
*"Within the hall, partitions divide it into inner and outer spaces,
separating it into rooms."*
Thus, Confucius’ disciples were said to have *"ascended the hall"* or *"entered the room."*
So the *táng* (hall) is the general term,
while *shì* (room) is within it, further distinguished.

Thus, *having* is for utility,
while *not having* is for function.
The *Dao* is without form—
it relies on *having* to manifest its efficacy;
without *having*, the *Dao*’s work would not be displayed.
Things are with form—
they rely on the *Dao* to reveal their nature;
without the *Dao*, things would not arise.

Things cannot form and complete themselves without the *Dao*,
and the *Dao* cannot display its function without things—
just as with chariots, tools, and rooms:
all take emptiness to benefit form,
and rely on form to serve emptiness.

That which is above form is the origin of the *Dao*,
dwelling in clarity and emptiness, doing nothing.
That which is below form is the function of the *Dao*,
receiving substance and taking shape below.

The *Dao*’s function is displayed through things,
and things receive form, so they are called *qì* (instruments).
*Qì* are the category of things with form.
The sage follows the *Dao*’s function,
crafting them into instruments:
drawing trigrams and observing symbols,
establishing writing,
hollowing wood for boats,
carving wood for oars,
cutting wood for pestles,
dug earth for mortars,
bending wood for bows,
carving wood for arrows,
constructing halls and dwellings,
knotting nets,
harnessing oxen and riding horses,
carrying burdens and traveling far,
casting metal for weapons,
raising poles for flags,
hewing wood for plows,
twisting wood for plowshares—
each of these, used to benefit the world,
are all divisions of the *Dao*’s function as instruments.

This is what the *Yijing* ["Systematic Commentary"] refers to:
*"The Dao is the name of the formless,
form is the function of the having.
All things arise from the non-being,
all forms are established by the Dao.
First the Dao, then form—
the Dao is above form,
form is below the Dao.
Thus, that which is above form is called the Dao,
and that which is below form is called instruments.
Though form stands at the boundary of Dao and instruments,
it is above instruments, not the Dao itself.
Since it has form and substance to serve as instruments,
it is called ‘that which is below form’—instruments.
The Dao is non-being,
form is being.
Being has limits,
non-being endures forever.
Those who cultivate the Dao
must externally fortify their form to treasure their being,
internally preserve their spirit to venerate their non-being.
Gradually attuning to the subtle non-being,
they align with the Dao,
and thus attain longevity."*

The *Dao* of the utmost unity and non-being,
things have symbols and forms as instruments.
To clarify the *Dao* through instruments,
it again borrows metaphors from chariots, tools, and rooms—
threefold reversals.
Their use in non-being is all of one principle.

When the sage governs the world,
he sets rewards and punishments,
establishes laws and decrees,
issues teachings and clarifies hierarchy—
these are all *having*.
Yet if he governs in silence and stillness,
emptily and calmly guiding people,
without speaking to transform them,
all things regulate themselves—
even with rewards and punishments,
institutions, teachings, and distinctions of rank,
if they are not used,
it can still be said to *"borrow having to employ non-being."*
This is the utmost principle.

In cultivating oneself,
one follows the classics to awaken to reason,
then through enlightenment forgets words,
penetrating the subtle gate—
not clinging to teachings—
is this not the same meaning?

**Song Dao Jun** said:
*"Thirty spokes converge at the hub’s function of non-being.
Having and non-being are in harmony,
utility enters and exits—
this is called the utmost spirit.
Having and non-being differ in appearance,
their substance lies in having,
their function in non-being.
The operation of yin and yang,
the principle of all things.
The chariot’s use is in movement,
the instrument’s use is in containment,
the room’s use is in emptiness.
Mysterious function arises from utmost non-being,
transformation and change are hidden in no burden.
Like a mirror with no image,
it reflects things to display light.
The sage’s use of the heart
ever resolves this truth.
Thus, having is for utility,
non-being is for function—
having is solid,
non-being is empty.
Solidity can embody form, appearance, sound, and color,
possessing substance.
Emptiness can move, measure, and respond without exhaustion.
Between heaven and earth,
the *Dao* manifests through instruments,
so non-being does not abandon having;
instruments rely on the *Dao*’s subtlety,
so having must return to non-being.
Wood bends and water moistens,
fire blazes and metal hardens,
earth balances and grains flourish—
this is *having*, on which people depend for benefit.
The heavens move in their course,
the earth settles in its place,
the four seasons proceed in their order,
all things flourish—
who is their master?
This is *non-being*, though the world does not perceive its traces.
Thus, having is never exhausted,
and having and non-being generate each other."*

**Laozi** expounds these three principles clearly.
**Wang Anshi** said:
*"Thirty spokes converge at the hub’s function of non-being."*

The *Dao* has beginnings and endings.
The beginning is the source from which all things arise,
the ending is the means by which all things are completed.
The beginning emerges through natural spontaneity,
unassisted by human effort,
yet it is the source from which all things arise.
The ending involves form and function,
thus it relies on human effort
before all things can be completed.

When the beginning requires no human effort
yet all things arise from it,
then people may remain silent,
doing nothing.
But when the ending depends on human effort,
then sages must speak,
must act.
Thus, the sages of old,
who governed above and took all things as their responsibility,
employed four methods—ritual, music, punishment, and governance—
these are the means by which all things are completed.
Therefore, sages focus only on refining
the methods that complete all things,
not speaking of those that give rise to them,
for birth comes from natural spontaneity,
which cannot be altered by human effort.

Laozi alone is different.
He believes that whatever involves form and function
is unworthy of mention,
unworthy of action.
Thus, he largely rejects ritual, music, punishment, and governance,
and only speaks of the *Dao*.
This is a failure to discern the Way’s principles,
yet he seeks lofty heights—
an excess of ambition.
What part of the *Dao* does he truly grasp?
Only when form and function are involved
must one depend on human speech,
on human action.
His text says:
*"Thirty spokes meet at the hub,
yet its usefulness lies in the space where there is nothing.*
The hub’s usefulness is found
where the wheel has no substance.
Yet a craftsman’s carving and shaping
never reaches that emptiness.
For emptiness comes from natural spontaneity,
and human effort cannot alter it.
Those who craft wheels today
know how to shape the hub and spokes,
but never touch the emptiness.
Yet wheels are completed—
the hub and spokes are present,
and thus their use is realized.
If one knows emptiness as the source of use
yet neglects the hub and spokes,
one is already distant from wisdom.
Now, if one knows emptiness as the source of wheel-use,
and emptiness as the source of world-use,
yet does not know how to employ it,
then one is near to folly.

Su Yingbin said:
*"Thirty spokes meet at the hub,
yet its usefulness lies in the space where there is nothing.*
Exhausting wisdom and resources to create instruments,
yet their true use lies in the emptiness within them.
If there is no emptiness, there is no use for emptiness to achieve.
If there is no instrument, there is no benefit to apply.
Thus, sages always observe emptiness to grasp its subtlety,
and always observe instruments to perceive their boundaries.
Knowing these two as one,
yet inseparable,
then one has reached the utmost.

Lü Jipu said:
*"Thirty spokes meet at the hub,
yet its usefulness lies in the space where there is nothing.*
The wheel’s hub turns, the spokes point straight—
these are the components that form the wheel.
Thirty spokes symbolize the moon’s phases.
*Bing* (埏) is harmony, *zhi* (埴) is gathering.
The craftsman hollows doors and windows to make a room,
yet its usefulness lies in the space where there is nothing.
The room is where I dwell.
When riding, I observe the wheel;
when using, I observe the instrument;
when residing, I observe the room—
yet their true use is always found in emptiness.
The principle is not far removed.
But as for the body—
how do I know its use?
Thus, I rely on form for benefit,
and emptiness for use.
If I depend solely on form for use,
and emptiness for benefit,
then what is called benefit
is also discarded and unused.
If I depend on emptiness for use,
and form for benefit,
then what is called use
is also harmful and not beneficial.
Thus, sages act within yet never possess,
acting without yet never abandoning.
This is how emptiness becomes use,
and form becomes benefit.
Therefore, it is said:
*Refine the essence to enter the divine,*
to achieve use;
*benefit and use secure the body,*
to elevate virtue.

Lü Nongshi said:
*"Thirty spokes meet at the hub,
yet its usefulness lies in the space where there is nothing.*
Form and emptiness rely on each other,
and cannot be considered in isolation.
Thus, without emptiness, one cannot employ form,
and without form, one cannot perceive emptiness.
If one uses form for benefit,
it may lead to stagnation,
but if one uses emptiness for use,
its application is boundless.

Wang Yuanzé said:
*"Thirty spokes meet at the hub,
yet its usefulness lies in the space where there is nothing.*
These three things—
the wheel, the vessel, and the room—
either move, or store, or dwell,
yet all derive their use from emptiness.
Emptiness is merely the opposite of form,
and form gives rise to emptiness.
Within emptiness,
there is a boundless subtle use,
a subtle function akin to greatness.
Form possesses substance and shape,
yet cannot respond to boundless needs.
Thus, one must rely on form for benefit,
benefit being the realm of the *yin*.
Although this is the theory of form and emptiness,
pushed to its extreme,
emptiness cannot exist apart from form.
Form is also true emptiness,
and neither form nor emptiness—
this is the true subtle mystery.
Liu Zhongping said:
*"Thirty spokes meet at the hub,
yet its usefulness lies in the space where there is nothing.*
I rely on form for benefit,
and emptiness for use.
The sage’s approach to the world is likewise.
By observing all its benefits,
one can then know its boundless use."*

「The potter blends earth and shapes vessels,
then fires them—
all these tools, carriages, and dwellings
are but means to serve the *yin* benefit of form.

Yet the usefulness of carriages lies in both form and emptiness,
the benefit of dwellings in their vastness,
while vessels, though few and slight in benefit,
still cannot be formed without relying on matter.

For all that serves a benefit—
whether much or little,
whether great or small—
arises from form alone.

Thirty spokes converge at the hub,
yet its purpose is but the wheel.
Though its benefits are manifold,
the hub’s core and the spokes’ alignment
are not yet accounted for.

Thus, the *Zhou Officials* states:
*"A single vessel with two gatherings—
the wheel is the most complex."*

In ancient times, dwellings were dug from the earth,
doors carved for entry and exit,
windows pierced for ventilation.
These structures, shaped by *yin* and *yang*,
established the order of rulers and subjects,
parents and children,
ancestral temples,
courtly assemblies,
and resting places—
all hidden within completion,
yet their benefits were vast indeed.

Hence, the *I Ching* says:
*"Later sages refined the world with roofs and walls,*
taking inspiration from *Great Strength* (*Tai Zhuang*)."
Vessels like pots and jars belong to this category.

Yet even among these,
few are prized,
many are merely functional,
the round follows the compass,
the square the ruler,
the curved the hook,
the straight the plumb line—
none without benefit from form,
though their true use lies in the realm of emptiness.

The Master Lao expounds upon this,
to reveal that though emptiness depends on form to manifest its use,
one cannot discard emptiness for the sake of benefit alone.

Thus, when form decays,
emptiness remains.
The principle of benefit and use:
united, they are one;
separated, they are two.

Benefit and use are not the same—
benefit is the realm of *yin*,
while use is rooted in emptiness.
The wheel’s benefit lies in its form,
the vessel’s in its blending and shaping,
the dwelling’s in its doors and windows—
yet their true use resides in emptiness.

This is why the sage *Mencius* said:
*"The ancient ways took benefit as their foundation,
and the Great Yu’s drainage of waters
was but the removal of what was not needed.*
Here, the use of emptiness is revealed.

The prior chapter spoke of *Mysterious Virtue* (*Xuande*),
yet *Mysterious Virtue* is relative to emptiness—
thus, it follows with the wheel’s thirty spokes converging at the hub.

Liu Ji said:
*"Thirty spokes meet at the hub,
yet its usefulness lies in the space where there is nothing."*

Exalted Master Bian Que taught:
*"Within the human body are five *zang* organs,
where the True Qi converges.*
Each of the five *zang* is governed by six *qi*,
thus the origin of the thirty-six convergence lies in them—
just as the wheel’s thirty spokes.
Flowing without ceasing,
they unite at the single hub,
like the thirty spokes converging at the hub.

The sage understands the pivot of transformation,
using form as its physical manifestation,
the body as a furnace,
the Three Palaces as tripods,
and refining within the void—
as boundless as the carriage one rides,
the vessels one employs,
and the dwelling one inhabits.
Form serves as the vessel,
emptiness as the use.
Thus, form is for benefit,
emptiness for use.

The ignorant of this age
hear only of the Dao of abandoning the body,
yet fail to grasp the subtlety of entering it.
This is why the Master Lao
uses the wheel, vessels, and dwellings
as detailed analogies.

It is like the *Qian* and *Kun* forming ranks,
yet the *I Ching* stands within them—
when *Qian* and *Kun* perish,
the *I Ching* cannot be seen;
when form decays,
the spirit cannot be preserved—
this is why form and spirit must both be refined.

The sage uses form as its vessel,
emptiness as its spirit,
entering form to reach emptiness,
and employing the false to attain the true.

How could mere appearance, name, or sound
be sufficient to grasp its essence?
Thus, it follows with the five colors.

Zhao Shizhen said:
*"First, it illustrates the principle that emptiness is the root of use:
One, to elucidate the *Qian* and *Kun* cycle of return.
Thirty spokes converge at the hub—
when emptiness is present,
the wheel’s use emerges.
The Dao, though void, manifests as use;
its function unseen,
it relies on substance to reveal itself.
Things, though solid, depend on voidness for their benefit;
their emptiness unseen,
they borrow the void for their capacity.
One vessel, one use—
mutually clarifying,
one and emptiness alone can truly manifest.
The use of emptiness is clear in principle,
the function of the void is unfathomable in Dao.
Thus, one knows that substance alone cannot serve as use,
while voidness harmonizes with all things.
Using three objects to display the mechanism,
testing two aspects to glimpse the one—
the alchemical method follows the lunar cycle,
advancing and receding in thirty days,
then naturally waxing and waning.

One is the hub—
though it has form, it is not used.
Thirty are the spokes—
the count of the moon’s phases,
all revolving around this principle.

To employ emptiness in guiding form—
without the hub,
the spokes have no place to rest,
just as the Dao governs time—
without the days,
the moon would not arise.
The *yin* void depends on substance to borrow,
its eclipses and waxings shaped by the interplay of light and dark.
The *yang* substance contains the void,
nurturing the *yin* like a toad,
and gestating the *moon* within the *yin* like a hare in shadow.

This is how the alchemist
takes the *Qian* and *Kun* cycle of return,
and clarifies the benefits of form and emptiness.

The Dao originally has no image,
yet alchemy arises naturally.
The hub and spokes illustrate the thirty-six principles,
and the text expounds on form and emptiness
as the foundation of benefit and use—
thus, the adept of the Way
responds to all things through emptiness,
while substance obstructs and does not flow.

Hence, emptiness is for benefit,
form is for use.

The spokes and the hub
comprise the wheel’s complete structure.
The spokes’ use lies in the hub—
voidness guides all things,
as if the hub were solid and the spokes hollow—
where would they rest?

Again, it is said:
*"The wheel is beneath the house."*
When emptiness is present,
it refers to the void within the hub.
With solid spokes and an empty hub,
the wheel’s use emerges.
When it moves without end,
then the wheel’s benefit is truly stored.

Thus, form is for benefit,
emptiness for use.

Two, it points to blending and shaping.
Blending and shaping create vessels—
when emptiness is present,
the vessel’s use emerges.
Blending and shaping mean
mixing clay and kneading earth to form vessels—
today’s pots and jars are examples.
Their emptiness is used—
when they can be filled,
that is the vessel’s benefit.

Heaven and Earth arise from the void,
yet generate all things.
The Great Dao, though void,
encompasses Heaven, Earth, and humanity,
and with a void heart
responds to all existence.
Blending and shaping use emptiness within
to receive all things—
thus, one knows that blending and shaping
are the benefit of form,
while emptiness within
is the use of emptiness.»

---

Having first clarified the meaning of the wheel’s hub and spokes,
now further elucidating the principle of blending and shaping,
for indeed the interplay of form and emptiness exhausts the Dao’s full function—
its meaning profound and subtle, not easily comprehended.
This is the very nature of reality aligned with the Way of Heaven.

Thus, it further illustrates the principle of doors and windows.

**Three: The Principle of Doors and Windows.**
Carve doors and windows to make a hall—
its emptiness is the void #1,
yet it yields the use of a chamber.
Barriers block the light,
but emptiness allows all things to be contained.
In all cases, one takes emptiness within for use.

Half a door becomes a door,
crossed wood becomes a window.
Doors function by opening and closing,
windows serve by revealing light.
If doors and windows were not carved,
how would halls and chambers exist?
Removing obstructions creates emptiness,
and chambers take this emptiness for dwelling—
thus, doors and windows are for benefit,
while chambers are for use.
For doors and windows provide the use of chambers,
and only then can chambers be complete.

Yet it does not end with these three—
taking emptiness for use applies to all things.
Grain stores are empty yet receive,
flutes and keys are empty yet sound,
vessels are empty yet hold,
boats are hollow yet carry.

The Most High points to these three,
and the rest may be inferred.
Later, it clarifies the uses of form and emptiness.
Thus, form is for benefit,
emptiness is for use.
Using vessels to manifest the Dao,
the Dao is then clearly seen within vessels.
Using emptiness as function,
function is then not found in solidity.

Yet vessels cannot be destroyed—
if vessels are destroyed, their use cannot be made clear.
Borrowing things to make statements,
without things, words have no foundation—
thus, the wheel’s emptiness fulfills its function of transport,
taking the creative vigor of *Qian* to generate all things as its model.
Blending and shaping have emptiness within for use,
taking the receptive emptiness of *Kun* to contain all things as its model.
Doors and windows have chambers for use,
comparing the emptiness of the heart to supply all affairs as its model.
Thus, one knows emptiness itself has efficacy,
the Dao is revealed through vessels—
who would say the void is useless?
They do not know that daily use lies in emptiness.

To say only form and appearance are true,
yet not know that form and appearance obscure their use.

Zhuangzi said:
*"The void is not destroyed, all things are real."*
Benefit and use are both illuminated.

*The System of Changes* says:
*"If *Qian* and *Kun* are destroyed, there will be no way to see the *Yi*."*
When emptiness and reality illuminate each other,
only then does one know the pivot begins,
obtaining the central harmony
to respond to the boundless.

Shao Ruoyu said:
*"Thirty spokes converge at one hub—
emptiness is their use."*

Laozi, using the wheel, chambers, and vessels,
illustrates the principles of things—
form and emptiness, benefit and use.
Borrowing form for benefit,
within emptiness, the wondrous and inexhaustible use is revealed.

Take the wheel, for instance—
today’s eighteen spokes, ancient thirty,
all converging at one hub to form a wheel.
Borrowing the wheel for its tangible benefit,
within its emptiness lies the wondrous function—
in its rotation, one knows emptiness is the wheel’s use.

Blending and shaping kneads clay to make vessels,
borrowing vessels for their tangible benefit,
within their emptiness lies the wondrous use—
in their capacity to hold and store.
Thus, one knows emptiness is the vessel’s use.

Ancient dwellings were dug from earth,
doors were carved for entry and exit,
windows for viewing the outside—
only then were the institutions of rulers, ministers, parents, children,
ancestral temples, and feasts established as chambers.
Borrowing chambers for their tangible benefit,
within their emptiness lies the wondrous function—
in their capacity for dwelling.
Thus, one knows emptiness is the chamber’s use.

Therefore, form is taken for benefit,
emptiness for wondrous use—
thus, borrowing the phantom body for benefit,
the heart of no-mind for use.
This teaches the student to embody the logic of form and emptiness,
to grasp the Dao’s benefit and use.

Wang Zhiran said:
*"Thirty spokes converge at one hub—
emptiness is their use."*

Mankind, born into the cosmos,
faces urgent daily needs—
three things the body cannot do without:
vehicles, tools, and dwellings.
Form is for benefit,
emptiness is for use.
If benefit and use are not properly aligned,
they become grave afflictions for the living.

Those who do not understand must first consider what suits them,
then determine the right course.

As for vehicles, from the Son of Heaven to commoners,
each has their due.
The Son of Heaven’s chariots are called "ten thousand,"*
lords "thousand,"*
ministers "hundred,"*
while commoners ride single-horse carts at most.
Few is not lacking,
but excess is sure to transgress propriety—
adding ornate decorations, embroidered reins,
yet not calling it deceitful or disrupting norms—what else could it be?
Thus, the ancients valued simplicity,
and even riding or walking followed ritual.
Hence, the Master walked when the Master walked,
ran when the Master ran—
the gentleman’s daily conduct never strayed from essentials.

Some fed horses and oiled chariots,
yet still seemed excessive in their extravagance,
deviating from the Sage’s pure and unadorned way of governing past and present.
To the point of hunting excursions,
breaking axles, wheels left unfinished—
how could such recklessness be fitting?

As for blending and shaping,
it refers to molding clay and crafting pottery.
The ancients used what was sufficient,
discarded what was spent—
no hoarding, no waste.
The people found joy in food and drink alone.
How could they know the quality of their tools?

In recent times, however,
strange novelties are prized,
wealth and ease sought above all—
none can match the age’s indulgence.
Yet even the sun’s warmth is not valued for its rarity,
only for its comfort to body and mouth—
people fail to heed the gradual loss.

The *Classic* says:
*"Carve doors and windows to make a chamber."*
This refers to ancient dwellings in trees and caves—
initially to avoid cold and heat,
to shelter from wind and rain.
Yet Emperor Yao built a three-step earthen platform,
thatched roof untrimmed,
and the people found contentment in their homes,
joy in their customs—
thus the land was in great harmony.

The Five Hegemons were not far removed from antiquity,
yet their carved beams and towering eaves,
their rafters reaching like clouds—
they still found their dwellings too narrow,
ashamed that their earthworks were not yet grand.
The hues of ochre and white left no craft unexploited,
while the five granaries grew empty and tranquil without their knowing.
Truly, they could not observe themselves through themselves,
their households through their households,
their villages through their villages,
their states through their states,
the world through the world—
lest they be lashed for their past mistakes.

Alas! All know the use of what is *useful*,
yet none grasp the use of what is *useless*.
Being and non-being, emptiness and substance,
mutually lend each other form.
When empty, no trace is seen;
when traced, it arises from what is.
Speaking of non-being, how could one know
the source of traces?

Thus Laozi expounded these three principles
to illuminate the ultimate of being and non-being, utility and use.

A chariot excels in bearing,
a vessel in containing,
a dwelling in sheltering—
all shaped forms are but *being*.
Lose it to non-being, and it cannot serve its purpose.
Lose it to being, and it cannot bring benefit.
Thus, non-being and being, utility and use—
even the ancient sages took them as models.
Students must not deceive themselves.

Program Tai said:
*"Thirty spokes converge at a single nave—
its use lies in the void.*
The function of storage is the chariot’s purpose.
When spokes and nave are complete,
only then can it bear and carry.
Yet a chariot without spokes and nave
lacks a foundation to reveal its function.
But examining its principle,
the grinding of earth and the turning of wheels
lie beyond all material substance—
thus, the chariot’s function belongs to non-being,
not to being.

That a vessel can contain,
that a dwelling can be inhabited—
their use does not depend on being,
but arises from non-being.
The principle is one.
Thus Laozi spoke metaphorically
to show the worth of non-being.
Indeed, it is so.

Therefore, the chariot-maker first prepares spokes and nave
as its foundation,
yet expects its function to lie beyond spokes and nave—
in the realm of non-being.
What is called *being* is sought to achieve it;
what is called *non-being* is sought to transcend it.

「This meaning is indeed a metaphor for Daoist learning—
the more one cultivates the Way, the greater the loss of rigid attachments,
and its principle rests solely in the interplay of form and emptiness.

Those who doubt Laozi’s teachings in the world
do so because they believe his "non-being" lacks substance,
and thus cannot govern—
they fail to grasp that Laozi’s "non-being"
aims to transcend "being" in order to utilize it,
not to negate all form and function utterly from beginning to end.

The essence lies in the balance of intent and totality.

The words of King Linchuan [Wang Bi] state:
*"The chariot-maker knows to govern its spokes and nave,
yet never seeks to grasp ‘non-being’—
yet ‘non-being’ arises as its very function once spokes and nave are complete."*

If one were to discard the spokes and nave from the chariot,
or abandon rites, music, punishments, and governance in the world,
and seek "non-being" as their sole function,
then such reasoning is close to folly.
This is a misinterpretation of Laozi’s intent.

Laozi’s teachings seek to fulfill the utility of rites and laws,
while transcending them to achieve true function.
His words on "being" and "non-being"
are akin to "gain" and "loss."

To "gain" is to seek what one does not yet possess;
to "loss" is to transform what one already has.
This is his application of chariot principles to human affairs.

When one seeks "being," it means accumulating trust and goodness
to fill oneself,
and to make them substantial and grand.
When one seeks "non-being," it means taking what is already full and transforming it,
so that its traces vanish yet its function remains.
The phrases "being" and "non-being"
refer to the realm where human effort is applied.

Yet King Linchuan’s theory equates "being" and "non-being"
to their completion,
as if Laozi did not know that a chariot without wheels
cannot be drawn or pushed.
Indeed, Laozi’s words are subtle and difficult to fathom—
though King Linchuan most cherished his text,
he still erred in following the words while losing their meaning.
The calamity of the Western Jin [dynasty] stemmed precisely from this.

They took Laozi’s metaphorical language to belittle rites and laws,
attaching themselves to the realm of discarding benevolence and righteousness.
Hearing of Laozi’s reverence for *wuwei* [non-action],
they hoped to govern without spokes and nave,
as if a chariot could move itself.
They failed to understand that within metaphorical language lies true principle,
and that *wuwei* [non-action] itself contains *wu buwei* [no non-action].

He merely sought to employ the spokes and nave
to manifest the function of "non-being,"
yet never abandoned them to neglect their "being."
Laozi’s teachings began to take effect in governance
from the Han dynasty onward.
When Cao Can [曹参] served Emperor Xuan [孝思],
and Emperor Wen [文帝] succeeded Emperor Gao [高帝],
they achieved harmony through *qingjing* [tranquility and simplicity],
and purity through *yuandu* [primordial stillness],
though they did not fully transform "being" into "non-being,"
they could still be said to have transcended form and substance
to gather emptiness.

Yet their *qingjing* and *yuandu*
were not equivalent to abandoning all governance.
The foundational laws of Emperor Gao were still in place,
and Xiao He’s [萧何] institutions remained.
Thus, the spokes and nave were already prepared in advance.
Hence, Cao Can and Emperor Wen could rely on their utility,
achieving stillness when they wished and silence when they desired.

If one were to discard Emperor Gao’s laws
and Xiao He’s regulations entirely,
leaving all to indifference,
then the Western Jin would have already perished.

Huang Maocai [黄茂材] said:
*"Thirty spokes converge at the hub to serve the function of ‘non-being.’
There is ‘being’ within ‘being,’ and ‘being’ within ‘non-being.’
‘Being’ within ‘non-being’ has boundless function;
‘being’ within ‘being’ offers great benefit.
The spokes and nave form the chariot,
clay and mud shape the vessel,
doors and windows create the dwelling—
these are ‘being’ within ‘being,’
upon which people depend for extensive utility.
Though there may be no chariot, its function remains;
though there may be no vessel, its function remains;
though there may be no dwelling, its function remains—
this is ‘being’ within ‘non-being.’
The enlightened and accomplished rely on its boundless function.
Today, texts like *The Parameters of the Same* [*参同契*] and *The Yellow Court Scripture* [*黄庭经*]
abound with such sayings,
for they have their origins.

Zhan Qiupu [詹秋圃] said:
*"In ancient times, ten spokes converged at a single hub
to serve the function of ‘non-being.’
The chapter ‘On Non-Action’ [无用] within *On Non-Action* [无用]
still contains practical application.
Though a chariot with thirty spokes revolves harmoniously around one hub,
even at the dawn of creation when there was no chariot,
its function of bearing loads was already inherent—
it cannot be discarded.
Though clay and mud are molded into vessels,
even at the beginning when there were no vessels,
their function as containers was already present—
it cannot be omitted.
Again, when doors, windows, and openings are carved to form dwellings,
even at the time when there were no dwellings,
their function as shelter was already there—
how much more so must one have refuge and rest!
These three [chariot, vessel, dwelling]
derive their utility from earth and wood,
yet their practical functions are ever-present.
From ‘non-being’ to ‘being,’
‘non-being’ is merely a means to harness utility for greater utility—
this is the function of ‘non-being.’

Zhang Chongying [张冲应] replied:
*"Thirty spokes converge at the hub to serve the function of ‘non-being.’
The heavens possess the Six Qi [六气], the earth the Five Phases [五行].
The Six Qi are yin, yang, wind, rain, darkness, and brightness.
The Five Phases are water, wood, fire, earth, and metal.
When heaven and earth first divided,
water came first,
and when humans first took form,
water was their foundation.
Water governs the kidneys, the root of life.
In the earth, the number six generates wood,
wood governs the liver, the abode of the soul.
In the earth, the number eight generates fire,
fire governs the heart, the chamber of the spirit.
In the earth, the number two generates soil,
soil governs the spleen, the seat of intent.
In the earth, the number ten generates metal,
metal governs the lungs, the repository of the vital breath.
In the earth, the number four regenerates water.
The Five Phases in the earth, in their cyclic generation,
comprise thirty in total.
This is the *qi* [vital force] of the body,
which moves and operates in accordance with it—
without contradiction.
Thus it is said: ‘Thirty spokes converge at one hub,’
meaning that humans are confined within the earth’s framework,
and the Five Phases, following the earth’s thirtyfold cycle,
operate to ensure the Six Qi flow harmoniously—
just as thirty spokes enable the hub’s rotation.
Others might say that the Five Phases generate in cycles,
and the Six Qi harmonize in balance,
and that five and six combine to form thirty.
The *qi* [vital force] moves itself—
all are one explanation.
Yet the hub’s value lies in its rotation,
and it cannot rotate if its core is hollowed out.
»*

The Five Phases’ thirtyfold cycle does not generate through emptiness—
then how would the Six *Qi* move and circulate?
The hub moves through emptiness,
and thus the chariot, through the hub’s rotation, can bear loads and serve its purpose;
the *qi* moves through emptiness,
and thus the body, through the *qi*’s circulation, can nourish and serve its purpose.
Hence, from non-being arises being,
and being is what is put to use.

As for earth forming vessels,
if it does not blend water, wood, fire, and metal in empty harmony,
it cannot contain its contents.
Carving doors and windows to make a dwelling,
if its halls are not left empty,
it cannot house its inhabitants.
Thus it is said:
When its emptiness is right, there is the chariot’s function;
when its emptiness is right, there is the vessel’s function;
when its emptiness is right, there is the chamber’s function.
*"Right"* means aligning with their natural state.
The chariot can bear things,
the vessel can hold things,
the chamber can contain people—
these are the uses of being for utility.
Being is used for utility,
yet it arises from the operation of emptiness.

The chariot, vessel, and chamber—
their utility through emptiness is thus,
and how much more so for humans,
who receive the Five Phases,
circulate the Six *Qi*,
and transform into spirit?

This chapter is Laozi’s exposition of the fallen earthly form,
to elucidate its meaning.

Zhang Lingying says:
In the human body, the essence above is like the spokes,
the *qi* like the hub.
The *qi* issues from non-being,
propelling the essence-spokes,
the essence condenses into being,
and together they revolve.
When the *qi* ascends, the essence descends;
when the essence ascends, the *qi* circulates.
They nourish each other without ceasing—
yet the *qi* cannot be diminished by a single measure,
nor the essence wasted by a single measure.
So long as non-being and being interact,
understanding the spokes and hub’s function—
what difficulty is there in longevity?
For essence belongs to yin,
following the earth’s thirtyfold cycle as thirty spokes.
The *qi* belongs to yang,
following heaven’s twofold cycle—
fifteen as one hub.
Without the hub, how can the spokes turn?
Without the *qi*, how can the essence move?
Such is their function.

Bai Yuxian says:
Thirty spokes—
like thirty days.
Shared by one hub—
one month is thus.
When its emptiness is right—
months wax and wane.
The chariot’s use—
even in small months, a month is complete.
Earthen vessels—
yin and yang interact, completing transformation.
When its emptiness is right—
heaven and earth lack no function,
sages lack no ability.
The vessel’s use—
though sometimes insufficient, heaven’s work is seen.
Carving doors and windows for a chamber—
ten thousand forms gathered in one net,
aligned with the celestial unity.
When its emptiness is right—
spirit does not guard its dwelling,
the five senses lose their watch.
The chamber’s use—
sages and fools share the same nature,
their wills turn inward to the external.
Thus being is used for utility—
obtaining one’s parents’ body for function.
Emptiness is used for utility—
preserving the original, undivided nature,
neither inner nor outer.

Liao Cuiran says:
Thirty spokes—
like the sun and moon as a jade disk,
one month completing a heavenly revolution.
Shared by one hub—
like the body’s primordial *qi*,
also revolving once a month.
When its emptiness is right—
unified by the One.

「The use of a carriage—
it may serve as my conveyance.
Molding clay to make a vessel—
with the *qi* of Yellow Court refining the soul and spirit,
refined by water and fire to form its substance.
When its emptiness is right—
the Dao governs its use.
The use of a vessel—
it may serve as my grand vessel.
Carving doors and windows for a chamber—
clearing paths for rear gates, for ease with water and fire.
Opening windows at the *chǐ zhái* [measure of land], to commune with the divine.
When its emptiness is right—
it is used as a comparison.

The use of a chamber—
it may serve as my divine abode.
Thus, the use of being is for advantage—
the *Tàishàng* [Supreme Venerable] speaks of its details.
The use of emptiness is for function—
no need for heavy labor, no burden of annotations,
two hands freely bestowed.

Chen Bìxū says:
From the thirty spokes to the use of a carriage—
this illustrates the interplay of *you* [being] and *wú* [emptiness],
mutually supporting each other.

The *Zhōulǐ* [Rites of Zhou] *Kāogōngjì* [Record of Crafts] states:
The carriage cover is round to symbolize heaven,
the carriage frame is square to follow earth.
Thirty spokes represent the count of one month.
The moon hangs in heaven, flowing endlessly.
The carriage wheels roll on earth, turning without bound.
Thus, ancient carriages symbolized the moon.
Moreover, thirty days compose one month,
just as thirty spokes unite at one hub.

When the hub’s center is empty—
the wheels can turn,
when the carriage’s interior is empty—
people can ride upon it.
Thus, its emptiness holds the use of turning and bearing.

Yán Jūnping says:
In the age of great antiquity, the sage ruled the people,
following the natural course of heaven and earth,
without contrivance of cleverness.
Drinking, they used gourds;
eating, they used their hands.
All things were equal, with no high or low.

When kings began to act with purpose,
they imposed heavy burdens and laborious tasks,
until the people were utterly exhausted.
The demands of the ruler were insatiable,
tribute came from afar,
men and women laden with burdens,
unable to bear the weight.

Thus, the wise crafted the wheel hub,
harnessed horses and oxen,
bore heavy loads and reached distant places,
easing the people’s toil.

Later generations followed suit,
and craftsmanship grew ever more intricate—
painted hubs and vermilion wheels,
adorned with gold and silver,
and embellished with jade pendants.
The cost of one carriage
could impoverish a household.

Hence, the *Lǎozǐ* [Old Master] lamented the harm of artificial creation to *moral virtue*,
and illuminated how doing good breeds disorder.

Thus, he expounds on the three matters of carriage, vessel, and chamber,
to explain how *you* and *wú* mutually support their uses,
and offers warning accordingly.

Molding clay to make a vessel—
when its emptiness is right,
it holds the use of a vessel.
*Cóng* [molding] is harmony.
*Zhí* [clay] is sticky earth.
The craftsman blends harmony with sticky earth,
shapes it into vessels,
and takes the emptiness within them—
this is the use of containing all things.

Yán Jūnping says:
In times when *moral virtue* and the Dao decline,
worries assail the inner self,
while yin and yang harm the outer.
The people grow weak and emaciated,
plagued by sickness.
Thus, water and fire arise together,
the five flavors form in confusion,
raw and cooked are not distinguished,
dryness and dampness are not separated.
Hence, the wise mold earth into vessels,
to cook sour and salty foods,
and so reach the point of field hunting and decadent excess,
ravaging all living beings,
hollowing wombs and slaughtering grains,
to gratify the ruler’s desires,
and carving jade into ornaments,
for cups and basins.
Ah! From simple vessels to such extravagance.

Carving doors and windows for a chamber—
when its emptiness is right,
it holds the use of a chamber.
*Záo* [carving] is piercing.
The half-door is called *hù*,
the window beside the door is called *yǒu*.
Door, window, half-door, and side-window—
all are general terms.
In ancient times, dwellings were dug-out caves,
piercing the earth within the hole to cover it above.
Making doors and windows was for habitation,
and taking the emptiness within—
this is the use of resting, entering, and exiting.

Yán Jūnping says:
Once the human heart changes,
all things harbor resentment,
serpents and insects rise,
poisons and calamities multiply,
beasts and wild animals harm the people.
Thus, caves and holes are insufficient
to ward off calamities,
to preserve life,
or to complete one’s natural years.
Hence, the wise build dwellings—
roofs above, eaves below,
piercing windows for observation,
fortifying gates and closing them tight,
opening and shutting with swift ease,
so that wasps and insects cannot enter,
beasts and wild animals cannot approach.
Later, this led to ornate pavilions and perilous towers,
the *Āfáng* [Hall of Ease] palaces,
great gates guarding strategic passes,
and building walls for defense.
Soldiers grow weary and exhausted,
and countless die in the process.
Yet what was once deemed governance
later became seen as chaos—
this is the fault of *you* and *wú* mutually supporting their uses.
It lies in the hands of the people.

Thus, the use of *you* is for advantage,
while the function of *wú* is for use.
This clarifies the three matters above,
showing how *you* and *wú* mutually support each other,
and neither can be neglected.

The use of *you* is for advantage,
while the function of *wú* is for utility.
The advantage of *you* lies in its outward form,
which relies on windows and openings to manifest.
The utility of *wú* lies in its inward void,
which depends on vessels and forms to fulfill its purpose.
Thus, *wú* relies on *you* for advantage,
while *you* relies on *wú* for utility.

*Wú* aligns with the Dao,
while *you* forms the vessel.
The Dao, though formless,
must rely on *you* to display its power.
If *you* were absent, how could the Dao’s power be shown?

The vessel, though formed,
must rely on *wú* to complete its use.
If *wú* were lost, how could the vessel’s function be fulfilled?

Thus, vessels without the Dao cannot be applied,
and the Dao without vessels cannot display its power—
just as the hub has spokes,
the vessel contains things,
and the chamber holds people.
All depend on *wú* to benefit *you*,
and *you* to utilize *wú*.

Furthermore, governing the body—
the spirit is the advantage for sustaining life,
the void is the function for gathering the spirit.
Thus, *wú* can govern and apply,
while *you* can benefit and serve.

Benefiting things lies in *you*,
while governing and applying lies in *wú*.
For *wú* is the state of emptiness and tranquility.»

The *you* is what is called **divine luminosity**.
Divine luminosity is the wondrous *you*,
while the void and tranquility is the utmost *wú*.

The wondrous *you*’s virtue lies in its benefit,
and that benefit is in sustaining life.
The utmost *wú*’s function is in its application,
and that application is in gathering the divine luminosity.
Indeed, the virtue of sustaining life and gathering the divine luminosity
do not exceed the realm of wondrous *you* and utmost *wú*.

Thus, it is said that *you* is used for its virtue,
and *wú* is used for its function.

Xie Tuonan remarked:
*"The thirty spokes converge to fulfill their function.*
The wheel’s turning depends on the hub.
The thirty spokes unite at one hub,
symbolizing the thirty days that constitute a month.

Things in their solidity rely on the void to move,
the spokes gather at the hub,
the hub turns within the void.
Thus, when it is merely *you*,
it is insufficient to show the wheel’s function,
but *wú* is the very means by which the wheel’s function is realized.

*Molding clay to form vessels is the ultimate function of *you*.*
*Molding* refers to pottery,
*clay* refers to earth.
Pottery shapes clay into vessels—useful things.
Yet vessels receive objects through their inner void.
Thus, when it is merely *you*,
it is insufficient to show the vessel’s function,
but *wú* is the very means by which the vessel’s function is realized.

*Carving doors and windows is the ultimate function of *you*.*
The *chamber* is where people dwell,
*doors and windows* are the means of entry and exit.
The chamber’s inner void makes it habitable,
the door’s inner void makes it passable.
When it is merely *you*,
it is insufficient to show the chamber’s function,
but *wú* is the very means by which the chamber’s function is realized.

Thus, *you* is the ultimate means of function.
Without spokes, one cannot make a wheel;
without clay, one cannot make a vessel;
without doors and windows, one cannot make a chamber.
Therefore, *you* is what brings virtue to the world,
while *wú* is what brings function to the world.
The solid relies on the void to contain,
the *you* relies on the *wú* to move—
this is the principle.

Indeed, I have discussed it:
The *you* above form is called the **Dao/Way**,
the *you* below form is called **vessel**.
The vessel takes shape through *you*,
the Dao/Way is concealed within *wú*,
so *you* cannot move *you*,
while *wú* is the very means by which *you*’s function is realized.

And so it is with humanity.
The movement of the limbs is like the wheel’s spokes,
the arrangement of the chest and heart is like the chamber’s structure.
If there were merely solid things and *you*,
would that not be called a vessel?
But the **soul’s platform** is void within,
the means by which it contains all within and moves all without,
and responds to limitless functions—
this is the case.

Otherwise, it would be but a rigid mass,
what use would it be?

Lin Yongzhai said:
*"The thirty spokes converge at one hub—
the utmost *wú* is what fulfills their function.*
The hub is the axle that holds the wheel,
the spokes are the ribs of the wheel.
Only because the hub is void within can the wheel move.

*Molding clay to form vessels*—
pottery’s vessels are void within, thus can they be shaped.
*Doors and windows*—
the luminous passages in the chamber.
These three examples all illustrate the void’s role in function.
Thus, it is said that *you* is used for its virtue,
and *wú* is used for its function.

Wheels, vessels, and chambers—
all are the virtues of solid *you*,
yet their very nature as wheels, chambers, and vessels
depends on the void’s function within.
With this, the single character *wú* is wonderfully depicted.

Fan Yingyuan said:
*"The thirty spokes converge—
this is the utmost *you* that fulfills the wheel’s function.*
The spokes are the wheel’s rim.
The *Shuowen Jiezi* states:
*The wheel is the rim;
the hub is where the spokes gather.*
This single character *wú* is a perfect verse,
illustrating how things reveal the Dao’s boundless function.
Ancient artisans crafted vessels by following natural forms.
The wheel’s spokes numbered thirty,
symbolizing a month’s days.
The hub’s void and passage allow the wheel to turn.
Thus, the thirty spokes gathering at one hub—
when the void is present, the wheel’s function is realized.

*Molding clay to form vessels*—
this is the utmost *you* that fulfills the chamber’s function.
*Molding* refers to blending,
*clay* is sticky earth, as in the *Shuowen Jiezi*.
It means blending sticky earth to form vessels.
Half a door is called a *door*,
intersecting wood is called a *window*.
If vessels are void within, they can hold objects;
if chambers are void within, they can shelter people.
Thus, when the void is present,
the vessel’s and chamber’s functions are realized.

Zhuangzi said:
*'If a chamber lacks emptiness and void,*
*then mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law will jostle within.*
*'If the heart lacks boundless freedom,*
*then the six senses will vie for dominance.*
This too uses things to illustrate the heart’s void and passage in function.
Thus, it is said that *you* is used for its virtue,
and *wú* is used for its function.

Therefore, all solid *you* is used for its virtue,
while all void *wú* is used for its function.
It is not only wheels, vessels, and chambers that are so.
How can this be verified?
My body has form,
yet within it, there are formless *wú* that fulfill its function.
It is not merely my body—
all things in heaven and earth are the same.

Xue Yongqi said:
*"The thirty spokes converge at one hub—
the utmost *wú* is what fulfills their function.*
These three examples show *you* and *wú* mutually relying on each other for function.

Chu Boixiu said:
*"The thirty spokes converge at one hub—
the utmost *wú* is what fulfills their function.*
The hub and spokes form the wheel,
the void within carries objects.
Molding clay forms vessels,
the void within stores objects.
Carving doors and windows forms chambers,
the void within shelters people.
Their mutual reliance on *you* and *wú* for function is evident.

*You* is the vessel—
artificial, thus subject to creation and destruction.
*Wú* is the Dao—
natural, thus without end.
Take the human body:
The head, eyes, hands, and feet are all solid *you*,
yet they all depend on the formless *wú* within to move.
Seeing, hearing, grasping, walking,
speaking, and acting—
all require the *wú* to function,
so vast is the *wú*’s role.

When life ends,
the body lies still in the great chamber,
the head, eyes, hands, and feet remain intact,
yet the *wú* no longer moves them—
no different from a wooden puppet—
because the divine luminosity has departed,
while the earthly frame remains.

However, *you* and *wú* mutually rely on each other,
and neither can be neglected.
If one were to take a mortal body
to cultivate the **sage’s fruit**,
by obstructing it to achieve utter void,
what harm would there be?

In general, *you* is finite,
*wú* is infinite—
this is why they differ in virtue and function.

The chapter expounds only the single character **無** (*wú*).
It is because of **無** (*wú*) that function is possible.
All things under heaven take form to achieve the work of vehicles and dwellings,
yet rely on **無** (*wú*) for their essence and **有** (*yǒu*) for their utility—
then they are not confined merely to vehicles and dwellings alone.

Zhuangzi says: *"Obtain its central pivot to respond to the boundless."*
All are skilled in establishing metaphors.
Some interpret the thirty spokes as corresponding to the number of days in a month,
a later passage finding it forced and awkward.

Others take **無有** (*wúyǒu*) as *"not yet having"* and cite the *Yì* [□] *Xìyǔ* [系辞] on the advantage of boats and oars,
taken from the *Hàn* [涣] hexagram,
and *"riding oxen, mounting horses,"*
taken from the *Suí* [随] hexagram,
as proof—
saying that even before these implements existed,
their functional principle was already present.
This is another view.

Niu Miao’s *Transmission* states: *"The thirty spokes yield the use of a chariot."*
A single chariot has thirty spokes,
and a month has thirty days.
When it speaks of the chariot hub,
it refers to the sun and moon.
If spoken of in terms of **道** (*Dào*),
then before the Great Primordium (*Dàpuǎo*) had yet divided,
before heaven and earth had roots,
before the sun and moon shone,
there was originally no use of sun and moon.

In terms of implements and utility,
the Age of Great Simplicity (*Shànggǔ Chúnpǔ*)
was pure and unknowing,
with no use of chariot hubs for turning or transporting.
It was only from the Yellow Emperor onward,
observing the revolving of the wild grass (*péng*),
that he fashioned the chariot
to bear heavy loads and reach distant places.
Later generations, indulgent in luxury,
adorned it with gold and jade,
and painted its hubs with vermilion and cinnabar.
The Most High Sage (*Tàishàng*)
witnessed the customs growing extravagant,
the purity of antiquity fading,
and thus composed this sigh:
*"When there was yet no chariot,
its use was already present."*

Molding clay to make vessels,
when there was yet no vessel,
its use was already present.
*"Molding"* means blending,
*"clay"* refers to earth—
it speaks of blending earth to make vessels.
Vessels (*qìng*) are the tripod vessels.
Ancient people took heaven and earth as the divine tripod vessel,
and the sun and moon as its windows and doors.

If spoken of in terms of **道** (*Dào*),
then before the Great Polarity (*Tàijí*) had yet been distinguished,
there was originally no heaven and earth, no sun and moon—
that was **道** (*Dào*).

In terms of dwellings,
the Age of Great Simplicity had no palaces,
summer dwellings were boats and nests,
winter dwellings were caves and burrows.
Later sages transformed them into palaces,
with lofty beams and eaves to shelter against wind and rain.
From the Middle Ages onward,
customs grew refined yet decadent,
luxury and extravagance flourished,
palaces sprawled in intricate layers,
towers soared in dizzying heights,
emotions ran wild, desires unbounded,
pushing excess to its utmost.
The Most High Sage lamented the decline of the age,
and thus sighed:
*"When there was yet no dwelling,
its use was already present."*

Thus, **有** (*yǒu*) is relied upon for utility,
while **無** (*wú*) is relied upon for function.
**有** (*yǒu*) refers to the sun and moon
turning and moving to bring forth cold and heat,
to heaven and earth as the divine tripod vessel
to refine and transform all things,
to the divine dwelling under heaven
to shelter and nourish all beings,
to the chariot hub bearing and transporting
to facilitate its turning,
to vessels and utensils
to aid in drinking and eating,
to dwellings and windows
to replace nests and caves.

All these are the sages’ preparation of things and realization of utility
to benefit the world.
Thus it is said: *"**有** (*yǒu*) is relied upon for utility."*

**無** (*wú*) is relied upon for function,
meaning when heaven and earth and all things were yet **無** (*wú*),
only **道** (*Dào*) was empty and boundless.
It is because of this emptiness and boundlessness that function is realized,
and thus it is said: *"**無** (*wú*) is relied upon for function."*

The **休休庵** (*Xiūxiū’ān*) commentary states:
*"From the thirty spokes to **無** (*wú*) relied upon for function."*
Awakening to the Great Dao is called *"obtaining the body."*
One must also obtain function.
Obtaining the body but not function is called *"dead matter."*
Obtaining function but not the body is called *"playing with affairs."*
Recognizing **德** (*virtue/power*) and **道** (*Dào*),
body and function complete,
is called a *"sage of insight."*

The **Old Master** (*Lǎozi*) uniquely uses the metaphors of chariot-making and window-carving
to illustrate **無** (*wú*)’s wondrous function,
benefiting and saving the world.
Thus all deeds of those who follow the **道** (*Dào*) are beneficial.

In the world, what is **無** (*wú*) is obtained for use,
abandoning **道** (*Dào*) and **德** (*virtue/power*),
how then could one complete the human world?

Yang Zhìrén says:
*"From the thirty spokes to **無** (*wú*) relied upon for function."*
It refers to the chariot wheel.
The thirty spokes follow the pattern of a month’s days.
The wheel is the mechanism,
the turning is its function.
Heaven uses the Big Dipper as its mechanism,
humans use the mind as theirs,
gathering the original spirit as spokes around the central palace,
letting the true **氣** (*qi*) flow and move through the body,
revolving and transforming creation,
concentrating the Five Phases,
harmonizing the Four Symbols—
all are the uses of the chariot.

*"Molding clay"* refers to the potter’s wheel,
a metaphor for the same mechanism.
Without this wheel, how could vessels be made?
If humans vary their mechanisms at the central pass,
the **栲子** (*kēngzi*) will turn everywhere without obstruction.

*"Windows and doors"* are apertures.
It is like the birth of **混沌** (*Hùndùn*),
a formless mass.
If one were to carve an aperture daily,
by the seventh day **混沌** (*Hùndùn*) would die.
Humans have seven apertures;
retracting vision inward brings life,
letting it loose outward brings death.

Thus the doctrine of **有** (*yǒu*) and **無** (*wú*) is spoken of by humans.
If one applies **無** (*wú*) to all things,
**無** (*wú*) generates **有** (*yǒu*),
and obtains its function.

**無** (*wú*) within **有** (*yǒu*) harmonizes wonderfully with the Primordial.
Yet when it speaks of **有** (*yǒu*),
it means **無** (*wú*)’s defects.

To possess a single eye within the realm of **有** (*yǒu*) and **無** (*wú*)—
only then is one truly at the core of the matter.

**無** (*wú*) is the means by which all things function.
Zhuangzi said:
*"Does Heaven move itself?
Does Earth settle itself?
Do the sun and moon vie for their places?
Who directs this?
Who holds the reins?
Who remains in stillness?
When pushed into motion—
is it because of some inherent mechanism?
Or because it is bound by necessity?
Or because it moves and cannot stop itself?"*

Qingzhong further explained:
*"The thirty spokes converge at the void for their function.
All things under Heaven do not arise from **有** (*yǒu*) alone,
but from **無** (*wú*).
When at **無** (*wú*), read it as a single phrase.
At the time of the thirty spokes,
there is yet no utility of the chariot.
Yet the chariot’s function already resides within.
Thus it is said: ‘the function of the chariot.’
When shaping clay into vessels,
there is yet no utility of the utensil.
Yet the utensil’s function already resides within.
Thus it is said: ‘the function of the utensil.’
When carving doors and windows,
there is yet no utility of the dwelling.
Yet the dwelling’s function already resides within.
Thus it is said: ‘the function of the dwelling.’*

According to the *Zhou Li* [*考工记*]:
*"The chariot’s canopy is round to emulate Heaven,
the carriage’s base is square to emulate Earth,
and the thirty spokes symbolize the phases of the moon.
The **毂** (*gǔ*) is the central axle of the chariot,
where the spokes converge to form the wheel.
**埏** (*kēng*) means to blend,
**埴** (*zhí*) is clay.
The potter turns and shapes to create vessels.
**凿** (*záo*) means to pierce.
Half a door is called a **户** (*hù*),
windows beside the door are called **牖** (*yǒu*).
Another interpretation: **無** (*wú*) is emptiness, is void.
When the **毂** (*gǔ*) is hollow and empty,
the wheel can turn;
when the chariot is hollow and empty,
it can carry people.
Thus, where there is emptiness and void,
there is the function of movement and bearing.
When shaping vessels, the exterior is solid while the interior is hollow.
Where the vessel’s emptiness resides,
there is the function of containing things.
In ancient times, people lived in caves,
dug out earth to cover their dwellings,
and thus created the design of doors and windows.
Where the dwelling’s emptiness resides,
there is the function of habitation and passage.
Thus, **有** (*yǒu*) is used for utility,
and **無** (*wú*) is used for function.
The utility of vessels lies in their form,
while the function of **無** (*wú*) lies in the void.
For vessels to be useful,
their utility must manifest outwardly,
relying on emptiness for function.
For emptiness to serve its purpose,
it must be hollow within,
borrowing the vessel’s utility to fulfill it.
Thus, **無** (*wú*) depends on **有** (*yǒu*) for utility,
while **有** (*yǒu*) relies on **無** (*wú*) for function.
**無** (*wú*) speaks of the Dao beyond form,
while **有** (*yǒu*) speaks of shaped vessels.
The Dao is not revealed without vessels,
and vessels are incomplete without the Dao.
The interdependence of Dao and vessels
cannot be separated—one cannot be discarded for the other.

Another interpretation:
Bian Que said that within the human body are the five viscera,
where true *qi* converges.
Each viscera governs six *qi*,
thus forming the thirtyfold convergence—
like the thirty spokes of a chariot.
Flowing ceaselessly, they communicate through a single pivot,
just as the thirty spokes unite at the **毂** (*gǔ*).
The sage understands the pivot of transformation,
using **有** (*yǒu*) as form and substance,
the body as the furnace,
the Three Palaces as the tripod,
crafting creation within the void of indistinctness.
Like the chariot one rides,
the vessels one uses,
the dwelling one inhabits—
these exist as **有** (*yǒu*) in form,
yet as **無** (*wú*) in function.
Thus, **有** (*yǒu*) is for utility,
and **無** (*wú*) is for function.
As Wei Boyang’s *Parametric Concordance* states:
*"Use **無** (*wú*) to govern **有** (*yǒu*);*
*the function of vessels lies in emptiness."*
All these interpretations hold merit;
let them remain for those who seek enlightenment.

Xu Liuyu said:
*"The thirty spokes converge at the **毂** (*gǔ*) for their function.
This passage speaks of the sage’s insight:
the thirty spokes unite at the **毂** (*gǔ*).
Observing things to understand the body’s Dao—
this is not merely about words.
The principles of chariots, dwellings, and vessels
have been thoroughly discussed by the ancients.
This need not be repeated.
Yet the Dao of observing things to know the body
is seldom spoken of.
Consider this: the head, eyes, ears, nose, mouth,
body, hands, and feet—
all compose the self,
each with its own governance.
Though they form a single mass,
movement, speech, and laughter all originate from within.
Yet when seeking the ‘self’ (*wú*),
there is no precise location to point to.
Is it not the self without position,
enabling the body’s numbered functions?
This is what the text means by:
**‘有** (*yǒu*) **is for utility, 無** (*wú*) **is for function.’**
Readers should ponder this deeply.

Chai Yuangao said:
*"The thirty spokes converge at the **毂** (*gǔ*).
The spokes are the wheel’s boards,
the **毂** (*gǔ*) is what pierces through them.
The **毂** (*gǔ*) is the body,
the spokes are the function.
Like the heart governing all laws.
When at **無** (*wú*), there is the chariot’s function.
When there is no chariot,
who reveals the marvel of spokes and **毂** (*gǔ*)?
When shaping clay into vessels,
who reveals the marvel of dug-out dwellings?
Thus, **有** (*yǒu*) is for utility,
and **無** (*wú*) is for function.
When **有** (*yǒu*) manifests, its benefits are clear;
when **無** (*wú*) manifests, its marvels are revealed.
The heart as body, utility as function."

Su Jingjing said:
*"From ‘the thirty spokes converge at the **毂** (*gǔ*)’ to ‘for their function,’
this passage embodies Laozi’s intent—
**無** (*wú*) alone.
The **毂** (*gǔ*) is the chariot’s central axle,
the spokes are the wheel’s ribs.
Only because the **毂** (*gǔ*) is hollow within
can it contain the axle to push the wheel,
thus yielding the chariot’s function.
**埏埴** (*kēngzhí*) are the potter’s vessels—
the turning wheel.
Only because the wheel is hollow and round can it rotate,
thus yielding the vessel’s function.
Piercing doors as windows,
then the dwelling is illuminated.
Only because the windows are hollow
does the dwelling’s function emerge.
The hollowness of the **毂** (*gǔ*), the wheel, and the windows—
all are **無** (*wú*).
These three, though void in substance,
give rise to function.
Thus, the existence of chariots, vessels, and dwellings
all arise from **無** (*wú*)."*

「This too carries the meaning of *things arising from the void*.
Master Ben-yī of the One Hut said:
*"Thirty spokes converge to serve their function.*
Things are *having* (*yǒu*).
That which enables their function is *void* (*wú*).
To wield *having* for the sake of *having* is merely to let things contend with things.
Thus, if *void* lacks *having*, it has no foundation;
if *having* lacks *void*, it has no master.
It is not only chariots, dwellings, and vessels that follow this.
Speaking of the world, things are its boundaries, while the Dao is its mystery.
Speaking of a single person, the body is its substance, while the mind is its void.
Yet *void* profits *having*, and *having* serves *void*—
these two are never truly separate.
Thus, there are no things outside the Dao,
nor a body outside the mind.

This is the *utilitarian* function of *void*,
not the *substantial* function of *void*.
If we speak in terms of substance and function,
then *void* is the substance, while *having* is the function.

Stone Pool [commentary] states:
*"Thirty spokes unite at one hub,
yet it is their void that yields the chariot’s function.
The potter’s wheel shapes vessels,
yet it is their void that yields the vessel’s function.
Piercing doors as windows for a dwelling—
yet it is their void that yields the dwelling’s function.
Thus, *having* brings profit,
while *void* brings function.

The thirty spokes unite at one hub
to form the chariot.
Yet the axle’s resting place must be hollow within,
only then can it move.
If the chariot were solid and not hollow,
what use would the hub serve?
The potter’s wheel shapes vessels,
yet the clay must be hollowed to form its handles and lids,
only then can the vessel be complete.
If the potter’s wheel did not rely on void for function,
how could the vessel ever be made?
Piercing doors as windows for a dwelling—
yet it must allow light and passage,
only then can one dwell and reside.
If it were not hollow and open,
what use would the dwelling have?
Thus, *having* brings profit,
while *void* brings function.

That which brings profit through *having* are chariots, vessels, and dwellings.
That which brings function through *void* all depend on emptiness.
To illustrate for humanity,
one must have a void mind to receive the Dao—
the Dao gathers in the void.

Some say that vessels must be hollow to contain,
and dwellings must be hollow to inhabit—
yet this is the very *void* of the potter’s wheel, doors, and windows.
Others say that before these chariots, vessels, and dwellings existed,
their functions already existed—
yet this may not be Laozi’s intent.
