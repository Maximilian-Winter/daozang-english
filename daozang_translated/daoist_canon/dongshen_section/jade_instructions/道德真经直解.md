**Preface to *The Direct Explanation of the Dao/Way and Virtue Classic***

According to the *Records of the Grand Historian* (*Shiji*), it is briefly recorded that Laozi served as the Keeper of the Archives. As the Zhou Dynasty declined, he departed. The Prefect of the Pass, Yin Xi, said: *"Master, you are about to withdraw into seclusion. Please, for my sake, compose a book."* Thus, he wrote the *Dao/Way and Virtue Classic* in two sections—upper and lower—speaking of the meaning of Dao/Way and virtue in over five thousand words before departing. No one knew his end.

Because the historical record mentions "upper and lower sections," later scholars followed this division, treating the first scroll as expounding the *Dao/Way* and the second as expounding *virtue*. However, upon rational examination, the text discusses Dao/Way and virtue as an undivided whole, with no true upper or lower sections. This is merely a misinterpretation in the historical account, and I have removed it.

Again, some unknown scholar, failing to grasp the original intent of the text, arbitrarily divided it into eighty-one chapters, merely pursuing superficial ornamentation and aligning with yang numerology—this is mere frivolous speculation, offering no benefit to humanity. I have also removed this division.

Furthermore, such scholars invented chapter titles, confining the text’s meaning within narrow interpretations, distorting its principles. I have also discarded these additions.

This text’s meaning is not continuous, for the Prefect of the Pass did not fully comprehend Laozi’s teachings when he requested them. Laozi thus spoke of his own matters, sometimes citing the words of ancient sages, which is why the text’s flow is disjointed and its language repetitive—like a parent’s tender, earnest instruction to their child.

Where the text touches on state affairs, it reflects Laozi’s lament over the prevailing winds of his time, matters pertaining to the Zhou Dynasty.

Where taboo terms appear, if altered, the original intent might be lost over time. Following the conventions of ancient scriptures and histories, I have left them unmodified, even if the characters are incomplete in transmission.

Many have annotated this text, yet though they claim mastery of its principles, they fail to grasp them, and though they debate its details, they lack proper method. For instance, some annotate *xuān pò* (玄牝) as "mouth and nose"—this is a failure to understand its true meaning. Others render *sǐ zhī tú* (死之徒) as the Pali/Sanskrit *niēpán* (涅盘), mistranslating it as "Xin’s ‘wuwei’ (無為)"—this is a failure in historical accuracy.

Such conjectural annotations, scattering the original intent, are too numerous to list. Their error stems from not attaining the Dao/Way itself.

The Sage Confucius aspired to the Dao/Way, yet since the Dao is formless, he grounded himself in the virtue/power of form to establish its foundation. Once the foundation is set, the Dao arises—gradually, not abruptly. How then could one indulge in virtue/power without advancing toward the Dao? This is what is meant by passing its gate without entering its hall.

To aspire to the Six Arts while floating in virtue/power, treating techniques as the Dao, mistaking filth for essence, dullness for simplicity, pace for nature, stillness for *wuwei*, abstaining from flavors as tranquility, coming and going as spontaneity, and divorcing one’s wife while sleeping alone as serenity—such people cannot be spoken to of the supreme Dao.

As the *Baopuzi* states in its eighth volume: Though the Five Thousand Words originate from Laozi, they are merely broad and superficial discussions. Within them, he does not fully expound beginning to end—what then is there to follow or verify? Indeed, many speak of chamber arts and alchemical elixirs, clinging to *youwei* (有為) as their practice, indulging in greed and lust, measuring the Dao of *wuwei* with shallow calculations. Thus, they fail to grasp its entirety—how much less can those inferior to him?

Moreover, they rank the reckless as superior and those cultivating virtue/power as secondary. To conceal one’s body and alter appearances, transforming the forms of things, is to invite demonic suspicion. Confucius did not speak of strange powers or chaotic spirits, for they yield no benefit.

Laozi’s writings emphasize longevity and clear vision, focusing on advancing the Dao rather than fixating on single outcomes. Even the immortals dwell on the Three Mountains, never leaving the earth, yet they ride phoenixes and attend the Emperor, never leaving heaven. Dwelling between heaven and earth, they endure for ten thousand years. Though they temporarily extend life, they must still return to death—if one does not advance the Dao, what differs from the great *chun* tree?

This is not a debate on right and wrong, but a warning against indulging in immortality techniques while neglecting the Dao. Among all beings, humans are most noble, yet they praise food and clothing above all. Only humans can comprehend life and death; they must not be ensnared by mundane attachments, lest death come suddenly. This is not a matter of timing—if one is lost along the way, it may take countless eons to encounter such a chance again.

To attain this wisdom is no easy feat; after twenty years of diligent study, one may finally awaken to its original truth. Yet the great Dao is beyond words—words are merely a vessel to reveal it. Once the intent is grasped, words are forgotten. Even with perception and cognition, true understanding remains elusive.

Now residing in Hangzhou, I met by chance the Qinghe Master, with whom I shared mutual resonance. Discussing this scripture, I found it the supreme opportunity within the teaching. Those who annotate it with verbose erudition only obscure its meaning for the common reader, making its essence difficult to grasp.

The Dao and virtue/power are not about excessive elaboration. If annotations are straightforward and direct, one should instantly perceive their meaning upon hearing, awakening to virtue/power and thus seeing the Dao. Persisting in this way is to repay one’s ancestors.

In seeking the original text, I obtained three versions, now adopting the Song-dynasty *Yulan* edition as standard.

In my annotations, wherever *de* (德) is mentioned, it pertains to Confucian teachings on the great Dao’s emptiness and stillness, aligning with Buddhist principles. I merge the teachings of Confucianism and Buddhism to verify the Dao and virtue/power as one, fearing my dull roots and meager merit may fail to uphold their essence.

This book contains techniques for preserving form, prolonging life, and ensuring longevity; methods for safeguarding the state and family; and supreme mysteries for transcending birth and death. I fear that if unseen, they will go unapplied.

This body is no different from that of ancient sages—only through such practice does one attain their likeness.

In our present sage ruler, reverence for the Dao and virtue/power manifests as filial piety and benevolence, embodying the virtues of compassion and frugality. Following ancient precedents, his governance brings peace and prosperity, harmonizing with the people. Thus, those who observe him remain steadfast in their duties to serve the state and honor their parents, ever mindful of desirelessness. Over time, the people flourish, and the ruler ascends beyond Yao and Shun.

By spreading these teachings, we repay the nation’s grace.

**On the Stages of Dao and Virtue/Power**
The Dao reveals reality through *wuwei*, while *youwei* relies on force. Illuminating the void dispels ignorance—this is the principle. Virtue/power embodies the Dao as a method applied to affairs—this is practice.

The terms *Dao* and *virtue/power* encompass all things without exclusion. Their stages must be clearly delineated, for the Dao has depths and virtue/power has inner and outer layers. Without understanding these stages, mutual slander arises.

The supreme Dao is absolute stillness, formless and nameless, beyond expression. Its scripture cannot be recorded, hence it is called *Taiyi* (太易). Its sound is also inexpressible.

*Taiyi* is the state before *qi* manifests. When *Taiyi* moves, the initial *qi* appears, hence *Taiyi* (太初). This is also *Taiji* (太极) and *Taiyi* (太一). Laozi names the singular *qi* as the Dao, while Confucius defines the Dao as that which is above form. The Buddhist exposition of the Four Noble Truths also calls it the Dao—thus, the three teachings collectively encompass all existence.

Without beginning with the manifest, how could one comprehend the void? By knowing the manifest, one grasps the void. Hence, the Dao has depths.

*Taiyi* is emptiness. Movement gives rise to the initial manifestation of form, hence *Taiyi* (太初). The emergence of *qi* marks the beginning of form, hence *Taishi* (太始). When *qi* and form coalesce, yielding firm and yielding qualities, it is called *Taosu* (太素). Before their separation, this state is named *Hun Dun* (浑沌).

Once *Hun Dun* divides, yin and yang interact, with *qi* residing centrally, giving birth to all things. Thus, Laozi says: *The Dao gives rise to One, One to Two, Two to Three, Three to all things.*

Therefore, the sage observes above and below, honoring heaven’s elevation and earth’s humility. Applied, this becomes governance and the enlightened Way of kingship, establishing the Five Constants and a hundred virtues to rectify the relationships of ruler-subject, parent-child, husband-wife, and thus govern and harmonize humanity.

The Great Dao is nameless and leaves no trace,
neither death nor birth it knows.
Through countless eons it endures unchanging,
exalted above all, ineffable in mystery.

The highest virtue embodies *wuwei* in action,
taking *One* as the law to govern the world.
Things arise without claim,
life unfolds without possession,
action is taken without reliance,
achievement is completed without dwelling.
Though others recognize its work,
no merit is seen—
and all things transform spontaneously.

Thus, there is no failure, no loss,
for *wuwei* alone ensures all is rectified.
Yet if lost, one clings to *One* while indulging in *youwei*,
becoming *internal virtue*.

The lesser virtue embodies *One* in action,
using yin and yang as the law to govern the world.
Thus, Confucius said, *"One thread runs through all"*—
those who establish *One* as the standard
see all things submit naturally.
If *One* is lost, then the Five Constants and hundred virtues
are pursued in deeds,
becoming *external virtue*.

*Internal virtue* is to embrace *One*.
For *One* is the mother of the state,
the root of life.
Clinging to *One* without separation,
roots grow deep and foundations firm—
this is the Way of eternal life and long vision.
Confucius called it supreme virtue,
grounded in the Dao.

What is also called *the Middle Way*:
before joy, anger, sorrow, or delight arise,
the heart abides in the balance of yin and yang.
The *Release School* calls this *the Middle Path*.
If the Mysterious School loses this,
it indulges in hidden yin-yang movements,
turning them into techniques.

*External virtue* comes from cultivating
the Five Constants and hundred virtues in conduct.
Confucius called this *sensitive virtue*,
rooted in action.
To dwell in gentleness, non-contention,
like water eroding the rigid—
as in kindness, frugality, seeming clumsiness—
this is its form.
If lost, it becomes cleverness, superficiality,
boastful strength, reckless hunting,
and the love of wealth,
dwelling in honor and disgrace.

The Dao is very easy to know,
very easy to practice,
yet people prefer shortcuts,
so the farther they stray,
the less they understand.
The Great Dao is plain and easy,
yet its power lies in *wuwei*—
achieving without action.

In brief, all return to *wuwei*,
*wuwei* through stillness,
and stillness as the natural order of the world.

Laozi spoke neither of elixirs,
nor of immortals ascending in daylight—
only of *Dao* and *virtue*,
not of techniques.

**The Stages of Dao and Virtue**
The Dao has two paths,
virtue has three forms.
The first is the Dao of *emptiness* and *wuwei*.
The second is the Dao of *One-qi* in action.
Thus, the Dao has two paths,
differing in depth.
The Dao of *One-qi* is also called supreme virtue.
From supreme virtue downward,
all belong to *youwei*,
hence the three virtues—
distinguishing internal and external—
these are all the orthodox gates of the Dao.

Dao, virtue, yin-yang,
and human affairs—
these four merge into one family.
If not harmonized,
obstacles arise at every turn.
Students must examine them carefully.

**Direct Exegesis of the *Authentic Classic of Dao and Virtue*, Volume One**
Originally explained by Master Shao Ruoyu.

The Qinghe Resident Zhang Zhixin annotated:

The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao;
The name that can be named is not the eternal Name.

Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;
Named, it is the mother of all things.

Ever without desire, to observe its mystery;
Ever with desire, to observe its shallowness.

These two, though issuing from the same source, bear different names—
both called *Xuan* (the Profound).

*Xuan* beyond *Xuan*, the gateway to all mysteries.

The Great Dao is supreme emptiness and supreme stillness,
formless, nameless—
not to be sought through sight or hearing,
not to be grasped by thought or reasoning,
not to be reached by speech or language.
It is the Dao without beginning or end,
eternally present, unchanging.

From the void’s beginning, *qi* arises as One,
leaving traces of its movement—
thus it can be spoken of.
Since it can be spoken of, it is not the eternal Dao.
Since it has the name *qi*, it is not the eternal Name.

Before *One-qi* manifested, in formlessness and namelessness,
this is the beginning of Heaven and Earth—
the Dao that cannot be spoken of.
Because of *One-qi*’s name, it becomes the mother of all things—
the Dao that can be spoken of.

Thus, one knows the body arises from *One-qi*;
if one takes *One-qi* as the law,
and awakens to it, one sees the Great Dao.

The Great Dao is the true mind of humanity.
*One-qi* is the desire born of the mind.

The true mind is originally empty and still,
without birth or death.
When the true mind stirs, desire arises—
this is called *desire*.
Thought, wisdom, intuition, cognition—
because desire arises from the mind,
one follows desire and receives life.

After birth, one accepts and rejects pleasures and aversions,
clings to sights and sounds,
relies on strength and status,
dwells in honor and humiliation,
loses oneself in delusion—
thus one clings to deluded mind.
Covering the One-mind,
one fails to grasp the Dao of *One-qi*.
If one abandons delusion and clings to desire,
this is the One-mind.

When held, it becomes upright;
when attained, it becomes numinous—
the mother of all things,
the root of birth and death.
Because desire persists,
the true mind is obscured—
thus there is birth and death.

If one has no desire,
no desire means emptiness and stillness—
thus one aligns with the Nameless Beginning
and escapes birth and death.
Hence Laozi says:
*"Ever without desire, to observe its Heaven-Earth Beginning—*
this is the mystery of escaping birth and death."
Again:
*"Ever with desire, to observe its *One-qi* Dao—*
thus it becomes shallow."
*Shallow*—boundary, the meaning of *shallow*.

Do not seek the mind with the mind as desire;
do not extinguish the mind with the mind as no-desire.
These two—having and not-having—
are united as One.
Because of speech as teaching,
they are divided by the names *having* and *not-having*.
When having and not-having merge, it is called *Xuan*.
The Buddhist School calls it the *Non-dual Dharma Gate*,
also the *Middle Way*.
The gate of *Xuan* takes the Middle as its law—
like a net’s mesh.
Yet law arises from the mind;
once arising in the mind,
it clings to the Middle—
thus it is not empty and still.
Laozi feared the Middle Way’s law would bind,
preventing one from abandoning the net—
thus he explained it again with *Xuan* beyond *Xuan*.

Students, if they do not cling to having or not-having,
nor dwell in the *Xuan* of the Middle Way,
but in actuality abide in the ground of reality,
untainted by a single dust-mote,
then the mind is empty and still—
this is *wuwei* (non-action),
thus no need for seeking.
Because of no attainment,
only then is desire truly absent.
Thus, not a speck of dust arises—
hence it is called *qingjing* (pure and clear).
No action at all—
hence it is called *wuwei*.
No cultivation, no realization—
hence it is called *ziran* (self-so).
No thing at all—
hence it is called *xujing* (empty and still).
Unconstrained and free—
hence it is called *xiaoyaoyao* (effortless wandering).
Perfectly ordinary—
hence it is called *tianran* (natural ease).

Thus, without desire, one transcends all distinctions;
transcending distinctions, one has no affliction.
The mind without desire meets all things without self—
without self, there is no strife—
thus no blame.
The mind without desire transcends all good and evil;
transcending good and evil,
one is unbound by cause and effect.
The mind without desire does not cling to all things;
not clinging to all things,
there is no birth—
no birth, no death.

He whose mind is ever without desire
enters the gateway to all mysteries.

All under Heaven know *beauty* as *beauty*—
then *ugly* already exists.
All know *good* as *good*—
then *not-good* already exists.

Thus, having and not-having give rise to each other,
difficult and easy complete each other,
long and short define each other,
high and low contrast each other,
sounds harmonize each other,
before and after follow each other.

Therefore, the Sage acts in *wuwei*,
conducts *wuwei* teaching without speech.
All things act without resistance,
are born without possession,
act without reliance,
complete deeds without claiming them.
Because they do not claim,
they do not depart.
They do not exalt the worthy,
so the people do not contend;
they do not prize rare goods,
so the people do not steal;
they do not display what is desirable,
so the mind does not stray.
Thus, the Sage’s governance:
empties the mind,
fills the belly,
weakens the will,
strengthens the bones.
Ever keeps the people ignorant,
keeps desires unaroused—
so those who know and desire dare not act.
Acting in *wuwei*,
nothing remains untreated.

All under Heaven know *beauty* as *beauty*—
if one imitates it as *beauty*,
then *ugly* should cease.
All know *good* as *good*—
if one imitates it as *good*,
then *not-good* should cease.
Why?
Because one observes:
having and not-having generate each other,
difficult and easy complete each other,
long and short contrast each other,
high and low incline each other,
sounds and oppositions harmonize each other,
before and after follow each other.
People, clinging to beauty and goodness,
obstruct the true mind,
chase after phenomena as reality—
thus arise the eighty-four thousand afflictions.

Therefore, the Sage acts in *wuwei* for the sake of things,
thus harmonizing all things.
Conducting *wuwei* governance,
teaching without speech to all under Heaven.

「Moreover, all things arise together in their natural course, yet the Sage does not distinguish them with words, lest the people develop preferences and aversions, which would benefit neither the Sage nor the people.

The Sage governs by *wuwei* (無為) to ensure the people’s peace, so that the people are born without knowing the transformations of the ruler. Though the Sage may be their ruler and father, they do not rely on this position—this is the display of all virtues. When deeds are accomplished, the Sage does not claim the name—this is the concealment of all uses.

Only by not dwelling in traces does virtue endure and not depart.

If one does not exalt the wise and capable, it is lest people boast of their cleverness.

What the ruler favors is called *feng* (風), and what the people delight in following is called *su* (俗). When the ruler exalts the wise and capable, the people below will surely vie to compete. If the Sage does not exalt the wise, it is so that the people do not contend for their names—thus, the names are not contended for.

Food and wealth should be provided for sustenance and care, not for treasured rarities that are hard to obtain. If one treasures what is hard to obtain, the people will hide it deeply. Human nature is such: if given, they do not value it; if hidden, they will steal to take it.

Governance in a harmonious age is not without the use of wealth, but it does not treasure wealth that is rare and hard to obtain, lest the people become thieves. If the lower people do not see that names and profits are desirable, their hearts will not be troubled, and they will govern themselves.

Thus, the Sage’s governance:
does not exalt the wise, so the people have no cleverness—no cleverness means their hearts are naturally empty, and empty hearts can contain all things, hence the saying, *“fill their bellies”*.
does not treasure wealth, so the people have no desires—no desires mean their resolve is naturally weak, and weak resolve does not follow the world’s shifts, hence the saying, *“strengthen their bones”*.
Confucius sighed over those whose roots were not firm—this is the case.

If one constantly makes the people without cleverness, their hearts become empty; if one constantly makes them without desires, they forget the world. When both heart and world are forgotten, there is nothing to cling to, and all affairs cease. Thus, even the clever dare not act.

Because the Sage acts in *wuwei* (無心) for the sake of things, all under Heaven will be without disorder.

The Dao is vast and yet finds use—
though it may not overflow,
profound it seems like the origin of all things.
It dulls sharpness,
unravels entanglement,
softens brightness,
unifies dust—
serene it seems, yet also as if it exists.

I do not know whose child it is,
yet it precedes the Sovereign as the model.

The boundless Great Dao,
transforming and generating *yīqì* (一氣),
*Yīqì* divides into yin and yang,
yin and yang transform and generate,
receiving *yīqì* as their essence,
thus knowing *yīqì* dwells within yin and yang—
hence the saying, *“vast qi”*.

The Great Dao, through its vastness within yin and yang,
finds use like the heavens covering the earth,
the sun shining and the moon overseeing,
winter’s cold and summer’s heat,
spring’s birth and autumn’s harvest—
all are the uses of vast qi.

Vast qi:
has form yet is formless,
is formless yet has essence—
between heaven and earth,
neither overflowing nor deficient,
profound it seems like the origin of all things.

Those who study wish to see vast qi:
they must dull their heart’s sharpness—
when sharpness ceases, their resolve rests,
and they can unravel the entanglements of myriad affairs.
With idle resolve and few desires,
they harmonize brightness without contention,
align with dust without strife—
within and without, unstained,
serene it seems, yet only one heart remains.
Though its traces are unseen,
it also seems to exist.

The *Shìjīa* (釋家) likens it to the wisdom-lamp illuminating the moon,
the *Yǎnjīa* (衍家) calls it the Great Elixir of gold,
Mencius names it *hàorán zhī qì* (浩然之氣).
It is spoken of as the greatest and most unyielding—
nurtured uprightly yet without harm,
filling the space between heaven and earth,
this *qi* is paired with virtue and the Dao.

When Laozi points to the serene as if it exists,
it is the *yīqì* (一氣) transformed by the Great Dao—
“I do not know whose child it is,”
this is the model of all things as the Sovereign before yin and yang.

Heaven and earth are not virtuous—
they regard all things as *chúgǒu* (刍狗), all cut and used alike.
The Sage is not virtuous—
they regard the people as *chúgǒu*.

Heaven and earth follow the Dao of nature—this is called supreme virtue. If not supreme virtue, then there is partiality.

Spring’s birth is not virtue—
autumn’s killing is not non-transformation—
they discard or employ things according to the season,
regarding all things as *chúgǒu* (cutting grass for sacrifice).

*Súgǒu* (刍狗) is like the straw-dragon of today—
used in sacrifices.
At first, it is stored in a red lacquered box,
covered with an embroidered cloth,
but after the sacrifice, it is discarded and unused.

The Sage, with one heart as their virtue,
thus takes the people’s hearts as their own.
Rewarding the good is not virtue—
punishing the evil is not non-virtue—
they follow the people’s needs and circumstances,
rewarding and punishing according to the times,
thus using the metaphor of the people as *chúgǒu*.

Zhuangzi says:
Supreme virtue has no favorites,
great virtue is non-virtue.

Only by being non-virtuous
is one truly great in virtue.

Between heaven and earth,
is it like the *tújué* (橐鞬)?

Empty yet not bending,
moving yet ever emerging.

Many words and frequent sounds exhaust the essence—
it is better to hold to the center.

Between heaven and earth,
meaning the four directions and above and below,
is it like the *tújué*—
the bellows and the reed-pipes?

The *tújué* is empty within,
its use lies in the formless—
thus it is not burdened.

The bellows inflates the wind,
the reed-pipes direct the breath—
moving yet ever overflowing,
like the opening and closing of *qiánkūn* (乾坤),
releasing and containing things.

Laozi wished to speak broadly and frequently,
yet his essence is better preserved by holding to the center.

The center is emptiness.
With the heart dwelling in emptiness,
its use is inexhaustible.

The *gǔshén* (谷神) does not die—
this is called the *Xuāntà* (玄牝).

The *Xuāntà*’s gate,
the root of heaven and earth.

Enduring as if it exists,
yet when used, it remains undisturbed.

*Gǔ* (谷) is used to signify emptiness—
emptiness is the Dao.
*Shén* (神) is the *yīqì* transformed by the Dao—
it is the having within the non-having.

The *Shìjīa* (釋家) calls this emptiness *shíxiàng* (實相),
taking its unbreakable nature as its meaning.

The *gǔshén* is formless,
born from non-birth yet also non-death,
hence the saying, *“the valley spirit does not die”*.

The valley is the origin of birth—
called *Xuān* (玄).
The spirit is the primal element of transformation—
called *Tà* (牝).

Thus, *gǔshén* is called *Xuāntà*.
All things emerge from the *Xuāntà*’s gate,
and what emerges is called *mén*—
this is called birth:
*Yáng* (天) and *Yīn* (地) are its roots.」

「To observe the *gǔshén*’s enduring flow—
its ceaseless, ceaseless continuation—
is to find the having within the seeming non-having, as if it exists,
yet when it exists, it is the non-having within the seeming having.

Those who act through it unite *shén* with emptiness,
yet do not rely on exertion, contrivance, or striving in effort.

Heaven endures long, Earth persists vast—
the reason Heaven and Earth endure long and vast
is that they do not generate themselves;
thus, they attain eternal life.

Therefore, the sage follows this principle:
he places himself last, yet his body is first,
he sets himself aside, yet his body remains.

Is it not because he has no selfishness?
Hence, he fulfills his own virtue.

Liezi says:
All things with form, appearance, sound, and color—
these are all *wù* (物).
People see Heaven’s enduring and Earth’s vastness yet do not comprehend.

Rainbows and mirages, clouds and mists,
winds and rains in their seasons—
*qì* accumulates to form Heaven.

Mountains and rivers, seas and valleys,
metals and stones, grasses and trees—
forms accumulate to create Earth.

Things with form—
how could they not decay?

The reason Heaven and Earth endure long and vast
lies in the *Sìjì* (四时) revolving,
inheriting the Dao as the master of birth and transformation—
Heaven and Earth, by not generating themselves,
thus attain eternal life.

Therefore, the sage emulates this:
dwelling in humility, never daring to exalt himself,
placing himself last, yet his body is before others—
first in time, last in rank—
for all worldly gains are but external to his body;
by treating them as external, he avoids being burdened by them,
and thus his body remains preserved for long.

The sage, by placing himself last and setting himself aside,
is it not because he has no selfishness?
He imitates Heaven and Earth’s *wéiwéi* (無為),
thus fulfilling his own virtue—
the highest virtue, like water:
water benefits all things without striving,
dwells where others abhor,
and thus nearly approaches the Dao.

Residing in a virtuous land,
heart like a deep pool—
generosity like benevolence,
speech like trust—
governance like harmony,
actions like capability,
movements like timing.

Only by not striving,
is there no blame.

People love strife,
yet Laozi holds that not striving is the highest virtue—
his parable is like water.

Water has no *xīn* (心),
yet desires to benefit all things without striving—
this is why it dwells where others abhor,
for water’s *dé* (德) nearly aligns with the Dao.

Strife arises from the *xīn*;
without the *xīn*, one is good at not striving.
By taking non-*xīn* as the principle,
one benefits all things—
thus, residing without *xīn* makes one good at his land,
heart without *xīn* makes one good at his depth,
giving without *xīn* makes one good at his generosity,
speaking without *xīn* makes one good at his trust,
governing without *xīn* makes one good at his harmony,
acting without *xīn* makes one good at his capability,
moving without *xīn* makes one good at his timing.

Only by not striving,
is there no blame to encounter.

To grasp and fill,
is not as good as letting it be.
To hoard at the start and then sharpen,
cannot be long preserved.

Gold and jade filling the hall,
none can guard them;
wealth and honor with arrogance,
one invites his own calamity.

When virtue is complete, name is fulfilled,
retire the body—
this is the Dao of Heaven.

To dwell in high status and great name,
yet fear the weight of gain,
is like holding a vessel full to overflowing—
ever dreading it will tip and spill—
not as good as letting it be,
and thus avoiding great fault.
To measure and then sharpen one’s blade,
or to wield power with force,
cannot be long preserved—
gold and jade filling the hall,
none can guard them;
it is because of wealth and honor that arrogance arises,
arrogance breeds excess,
and this is not Heaven’s retribution—
one invites his own misfortune.

Yet how does one escape this fate?
Therefore, the sage observes the revolutions of the *Sìjì*,
like the spring’s birth and transformation—
when virtue is complete and name is fulfilled,
at the height of summer, he retires his body,
never lingering—
this is the Dao of Heaven.

*Zhíjiě* (直解) of the *True Classic of the Dao and Virtue* (道德真经), Volume II, ends here.

#1  *Yǐ* (已) also emulates this as beauty: ["beauty" likely means "virtue"]
#2  *Míng* (名) does not contend for its name: this sentence is likely interpolated.

*Zhíjiě* of the *True Classic of the Dao and Virtue*, Volume II, begins here with *Běnlái* (本来) by Zǐ Shào (子邵), as if he were a simpleton.»

「Master Zhang Zhixin of Qinghe, in his annotated version, asks:
Can one who nurtures the *Yíngpò* (营魄) and embraces the *Yī* (一) remain undivided?

Can one who focuses his *qì* (气) to achieve supreme softness attain the state of an infant?

Can one who purifies and contemplates the *Xuánlǎn* (玄览) remain free from flaws, as if a jade without blemish?

Can one who loves the people and governs the state act without doing?

Can one who opens and closes the *Tiānmén* (天门) act as the receptive *fēi* (雌)?

Can one who is clear and boundless in all directions remain without knowledge?

To give birth and to rear—
to give birth yet not possess,
to act yet not claim credit,
to grow yet not dominate—
this is called *Xuán Dé* (玄德).

The mind has no fixed name,
but stands in accordance with its place.

When the mind moves, it attaches to things;
attaching to things reveals the mind.

When the mind moves, it belongs to *yáng* (阳),
and its name is *shén* (神), also called the mind.

When the mind is still, it belongs to *yīn* (阴),
and its name is *jīng* (精), focused unity, also called *xìng* (性).

When the mind turns outward,
it becomes sight and hearing,
and its name is *hún* (魂), also called *qíng* (情).

When the mind turns inward,
it withdraws sight and reverses hearing,
and its name is *pò* (魄), also called *yì* (意).

All these names arise from their respective places,
yet collectively are called the mind.

Thus it is known:
The mind is the *Zǎichéng* (载乘) of the body,
its sovereign, never ceasing to govern.

Now, speaking of *pò* (魄),
it is said that *pò* belongs to *yīn* (阴),
and *yīn* is governed by stillness.

When the mind is inwardly still,
the *jīng* (精) and *pò* (魄) reside;
when *jīng* and *pò* reside,
the *shén* (神) and *hún* (魂) reside.

*Yáng* (阳) is suppressed by *yīn* (阴),
and the male is governed by the female.

When *shén* (神), *hún* (魂), *jīng* (精), and *pò* (魄) blend harmoniously into one,
this is called *Bàoshǒu* (抱守) as *yī* (一).

Though one who embraces *Yī* (一) may follow the *Èrqì* (二气) along the Yellow Dao,
meet the *Sānxìng* (三性) in the Primordial Palace,
penetrate the *Wǔxíng* (五行), and harmonize the *Sìxiàng* (四象),
this is but the technique of longevity,
not yet attaining the Dao/Way.

The *Lǎozǐ* (老子) sighed:
"Can one remain undivided?"
To separate and enter, to withdraw and return—
only when the mind is hollowed out and cleansed in stillness
does one attain *Wúwéi* (无为),
this being the true mind,
the great Dao/Way.

As for focusing *qì* (气) to achieve softness,
once one speaks of focusing *qì*,
it is already the use of the mind;
having the mind means one cannot achieve true softness.
Can one compare it to the infant’s mind,
which knows no separation?

If one purifies and removes all phenomena,
and holds the mind in supreme stillness—
like a jade without flaw,
can one remain free from attachment,
and thus be without blemish?

The mind of loving the people and governing the state
is the essence of governing the world;
its deeds are manifest in traces,
and traces bring worry.
Yet can one display the virtues of *rén* (仁),
conceal the applications of *shī* (施),
and remain without doing?

The natural opening and closing of the *Tiānmén* (天门),
the mind is its gate.
When opened and closed in response to affairs,
can one follow and yield to the emotions of things
and act as the receptive *fēi* (雌)?

The mind is originally still, clear, and pure,
boundless in all directions.
Yet through attachment and entanglement,
knowledge and perception arise,
and understanding becomes obstructed.
Can one remain without knowledge?

For the *Yī* (一) is the root of grasping and attachment,
the origin of birth and death.

Once one clings to *Yī*,
it is no longer the Dao/Way of *Wúwéi* (无为).
Only when one departs from the traces of embracing *Yī*
does one align with the *Xuán Dào* (玄道) of *Dé* (德).

The *Xuán Dé* (玄德) is to give birth and to rear—
the Dao/Way gives birth yet does not possess,
*Dé* (德) acts yet does not claim credit,
and when it reaches full growth,
it does not dominate.
This is called *Xuán Dé*.

Therefore, *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子) said:
"To be in accord with the *Yī* (一),
all affairs are complete—
as if without a mind,
yet the ghosts and spirits submit.
This is what is meant."」

The thirty spokes converge at the single hub,
yet it is their emptiness that makes the carriage useful.
Clay is shaped into vessels,
yet it is their emptiness that makes them functional.
Doors and windows are carved for rooms,
yet it is their emptiness that makes them livable.

Thus, what is *yǒu* (有) is for utility,
while what is *wú* (无) is for use.

Laozi illustrates with carriages, vessels, and rooms
the principles of things—
how *yǒu* (有) brings convenience,
while within *wú* (无) lies the boundless, wondrous use.

Take the carriage: today’s eighteen spokes,
ancient thirty spokes—
all converging at the single hub to form the wheel.
The wheel itself is a tangible benefit,
yet within its emptiness lies the marvelous function of motion.
Thus, one knows that *wú* (无) is the true use of the carriage.

*Yáo* (埏) is blending, *zhì* (埴) is clay—
shaped into vessels, like pots and jars.
The vessel is a tangible benefit,
yet within its emptiness lies the marvelous function of containment.
Thus, one knows that *wú* (无) is the true use of the vessel.

Ancient dwellings were dug from earth,
doors and windows carved for entry and sight—
then arranged into halls for rulers, parents, and ancestral rites.
The room is a tangible benefit,
yet within its emptiness lies the marvelous function of habitation.
Thus, one knows that *wú* (无) is the true use of the room.

Therefore, the Sage values *yǒu* (有) for its convenience,
but *wú* (无) for its profound use.
Hence, the Sage employs the illusory body for utility,
and the mind without mind for function,
teaching disciples to grasp the principles of *yǒu* and *wú*
and perceive the Dao’s true utility.

The five colors blind the eyes,
the five tones deafen the ears,
the five flavors dull the palate,
hunting and chasing drive the mind to madness,
rare treasures disrupt conduct.

Thus, the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes.
He discards the former to embrace the latter.

Laozi says the five colors blind the eyes,
the five tones deafen the ears,
the five flavors dull the palate—
blindness, deafness, and loss of taste
are all excesses of sensory indulgence,
clouding the true mind
and preventing perception of the Great Dao.

As for hunting and chasing,
indulging in unrestrained pleasures,
it drives the mind to madness.
If one covets rare treasures,
attachment and greed disrupt conduct.
Thus, the Sage nourishes the belly—
able to contain all things—
and does not indulge the desires of the ears and eyes.
Only by abandoning false attachments
can one truly attain real perception.

Honor and disgrace are like sudden shocks,
wealth and great misfortune are like the body itself.

What is meant by *honor and disgrace as sudden shocks*?
Honor is lowly—
gaining it is like a shock,
losing it is like a shock.
This is called *honor and disgrace as sudden shocks*.

What is meant by *wealth and great misfortune as the body itself*?
My great misfortune arises because I have a body.
If I had no body, what misfortune would I have?
Thus, to value the body as the world—
if one can entrust the world to it—
to love the body as the world—
if one can commit the world to it.

Honor and disgrace are sudden shocks,
wealth is a great misfortune—
all because of the body.

Laozi asks: What are honor and disgrace?
Honor is gained, disgrace is lost.
Cold begets heat, honor begets disgrace—
thus, honor is lowly.
People cling to wealth and love for the body,
so gaining it fears loss—
hence the shock—
losing it brings sorrow and regret—
hence the shock.
This is called *honor and disgrace as sudden shocks*.

Laozi asks: What is *wealth and great misfortune as the body itself*?
Laozi says: My great misfortune arises because I receive wealth and love for my body.
If I no longer receive wealth and love for my body,
then what misfortune would I have?
Thus, if one values the body as the world,
one must invite disgrace—
if one can entrust the world to it.
If one loves the body as the world,
one must invite misfortune—
if one can commit the world to it.

It cannot be seen—*yí* (夷).
It cannot be heard—*xī* (希).
It cannot be grasped—*wēi* (微).
These three are beyond examination,
thus they merge into *hún* (混) as *yī* (一).

Its upper reaches are not bright—*jiǎo* (皦),
its lower depths are not dark—*mèi* (昧).
*Shéngshéng* (绳绳) yet nameless,
it returns to *wúwù* (无物).

This is called the *zhuàng* (状) without *zhuàng*,
the *xiàng* (象) without *wù* (物)—
this is called *huǎnghū* (恍惚).

Approach it, and you see no head;
follow it, and you see no tail.

Hold fast to the ancient Dao
to govern the present *yǒu* (有).
To know the ancient beginning
is called the *jì* (纪) of the Dao.

The Great Dao is empty and formless,
thus it cannot be seen—
its intent is vast and distant, hence called *yí*.
The Great Dao is soundless,
thus it cannot be heard—
its intent is subtle and expansive, hence called *xī*.
The Great Dao is shapeless,
thus it cannot be grasped—
its intent is minute, hence called *wēi*.

Without form, without sound, without shape—
these three cannot be examined in detail.
Thus, they merge as *hún* (混) into *yī qì* (一气).

One aspect governs above,
moving sun, moon, wind, and rain without brightness—*jiǎo*.
One aspect sustains below,
nurturing all things without obscurity—*mèi*.

*Shéngshéng* (绳绳)—
speaking of the continuous flow of *yī qì*,
unbroken from above to below.

It can be yin, it can be yang,
it can be round, it can be square,
it can be green, it can be yellow—
its marvelous uses are unfathomable,
thus it cannot be named,
returning to the *wú* within *wù* (物).

Thus, the human mind itself
is the *húnyuán yī qì* (混元一气).
This is called the *zhuàng* within *wú zhuàng*,
the *xiàng* within *wú wù* (物).
*Zhuàng* and *xiàng* share the same meaning—
two phrases stating the same truth.

This is called *huǎng* (恍)—
seemingly having yet not having—
and *hū* (惚)—
seemingly not having yet having.
*Huǎnghū* speaks of the indeterminate nature of having and not having,
thus approaching it reveals no head,
following it reveals no tail.

Hold fast to the ancient Dao
to govern the present *yǒu* (有).
To know the ancient beginning
is called the *jì* (纪) of the Dao.

With one mind, one advances along the Dao—
the *Shì* (释) School calls this mind *bōrě* (般若),
relying on one mind to attain the other shore.

This is called the **framework of the Great Dao**.

The ancient masters who excelled in the Way were subtle and profound, their depths unfathomable.
Because they were unfathomable, they were compelled to describe them in metaphor:
*Yǔ* (豫) as if crossing a river in winter,
*Yóu* (犹) as if fearing the four neighbors—
solemn and dignified, yet yielding like *róng* (容),
dissolving like ice about to thaw—
*dūn* (敦) as if upright like uncarved wood,
*kuàng* (旷) as if vast like a valley,
*hún* (浑) as if muddied like turbid water.

Who can, within the turbid, still it to reveal gradual clarity?
Who can, within the tranquil, move it to reveal gradual life?

Those who uphold this Dao do not seek fullness.
Because they do not seek fullness,
they can expose the hidden without daily renewal to attain the Way.

The *Lǎozǐ* says that the ancient masters who excelled in the Way were subtle and profound,
their deep principles unfathomable.
Because these principles are unfathomable,
they are provisionally described in metaphor,
and the meaning of *yǔ* (豫) is further clarified.

*Yǔ* (豫) as if crossing a river in winter—
to walk alone through water is called *shè* (涉).
A confluence of streams is called *chuān* (川).
This speaks of the meaning of reluctantly responding to affairs out of necessity.

*Yóu* (犹) as if fearing the four neighbors—
this speaks of the meaning of one’s nature not extending outward.

Solemn and dignified, yet yielding like *róng* (容)—
this speaks of the meaning of maintaining a composed demeanor to awaken insight.

Dissolving like ice about to thaw—
this speaks of the meaning of the mind, like ice, gradually dissolving and dispersing.

*Dūn* (敦) as if upright like uncarved wood—
*kuàng* (旷) as if vast like a valley—
*hún* (浑) as if muddied like turbid water.

Who can, within the turbid and muddied, perceive the gradual clarity of stillness,
as if fearing the four neighbors?

Who can, within the tranquil and still, perceive the gradual emergence of movement,
as if crossing a river in winter?

Those who uphold this subtle and profound Dao do not desire to hold fullness.
*Mǎn* (满) means fullness.
Because they do not seek fullness,
they remain constantly empty and tranquil—
empty and tranquil, thus able to expose the hidden without daily renewal
and attain the Way.

To attain emptiness to its utmost,
to uphold stillness with sincerity—
when all things arise together,
I observe their return.

For things are myriad and myriad,
each returning to its root.
Returning to the root is called *jìng* (静),
and *jìng* is the daily restoration of *mìng* (命).
Restoration of *mìng* is called *cháng* (常),
and knowing *cháng* is called *míng* (明).
Not knowing *cháng* leads to reckless action—*xiōng* (凶).
Knowing *cháng* allows for *róng* (容),
and *róng* becomes *gōng* (公),
*gōng* becomes *wáng* (王),
*wáng* becomes *tiān* (天),
*tiān* becomes *Dào* (道),
and *Dào* endures forever—
thus, one’s life does not perish.

Those who revere the Dao must attain emptiness to its utmost
and uphold stillness with sincerity.
For all things arise together,
and from emptiness, *mìng* (命) transforms into *shénhuà* (神化),
*shénhuà* into *yīnyáng qì* (阴阳气),
*qì* into form,
and form returns to emptiness—
clearly seeing that emptiness is the root.
Thus, *Lǎozǐ* says, "I observe their return."

For things are myriad and myriad,
from small to great,
from great to old—
each returns to its root.
Students who wish to understand the method of returning to the root say that the heart must be still.
*Jìng* (静) means the cessation of both inner and outer activity.

Again, it is said that *jìng* is the restoration of *mìng*—
not that within stillness there is some restoration seen,
but that by restoring the heart to stillness,
one attains its emptiness—
thus, it is called *xūjìng* (虚静).

Then governance becomes sincere and steadfast—
this principle cannot be spoken or proclaimed,
for it is the original *mìng* of the Great Dao bestowed upon us.
Thus, it is called *mìng* (命).

This *mìng* transcends *yīn* and *yáng*,
for it is the emptiness of the Great Dao.
The world speaks of life and death determined by *mìng*—
this refers to *yīn* and *yáng*.

The *mìng* that gives us form
dwells within *yīn* and *yáng*—
thus, blessings and misfortunes,
longevity and early death,
are all visible in their unfolding.

This *mìng* has neither birth nor death,
persisting eternally across the ten thousand ages—
thus, it is called *cháng* (常).
Those who know this eternal principle are called *míng* (明).
Not knowing the eternal principle leads to reckless action—
*xiōng* (凶) is near to disaster.

Knowing this eternal principle,
one’s heart becomes empty and tranquil,
and only then can one embrace all phenomena.

Empty and tranquil, one attains *gōngzhèng* (公正),
which is the *wángdé* (王德) of kingship.
A king governs the realm with emptiness and tranquility—
this is called *wúwéi* (无为),
and it aligns with *tiān* (天).

The emptiness and tranquility of *tiān* align with *Dào* (道).
Humans who align with the emptiness and tranquility of *Dào*
endure forever—
thus, one’s life does not perish.

Returning to the root and restoring *mìng*,
the eternal Dao has no end.

The highest level: the people below do not know of its existence;
The next level: they cherish and praise it;
The next level: they fear and revile it.
Thus, when trust is insufficient,
there are those who do not believe.

*Yóu* (犹) is the value of speech.
When the work is accomplished and the affair fulfilled,
the people all say, "This is natural."

When the Great Dao is abandoned,
there arises *rényì* (仁义);
When wisdom emerges,
there arises great *wěi* (伪);
When the six relations are not in harmony,
there arises filial孝 and kindness慈;
When the state is in chaos,
there arise loyal ministers.

To abandon the Sage and discard wisdom,
the people benefit a hundredfold;
To abandon *rén* (仁) and discard *yì* (义),
the people return to filial孝 and kindness慈;
To abandon cleverness and discard profit,
thieves and robbers cease to exist.

This triad—*rényì* (仁义), *zhìhuì* (智慧), and *qiǎolì* (巧利)—
is insufficient to suffice as the Way’s essence,
so the Sage established *shǔyīn* (属音) and *shùzhú* (烛) as their counterparts.

To behold the undyed and embrace the uncarved,
to minimize private desires and reduce cravings—
this was the age of the Most High in ancient times,
when the Way of *wúwéi* (无为) transformed the world,
and the common folk knew only of the Sage’s transformation,
yet saw no trace of it.

In the next age, down to Yao and Shun,
purity and simplicity began to disperse,
and though they taught through *yǒuwéi* (有为),
they sought to restore the Way of *wúwéi*,
yet by manifesting the traces of *rén* (仁) and *yì* (义),
the people vied to honor them,
and moved by the Sage’s wise governance,
they praised it joyfully.
From then on, *rén* and *yì* altered human nature,
and the Way of *wúwéi* was lost.

As Zhuangzi said:
*"Since the House of Yu took the Seven Codes to disrupt the world."*

In the next age, down to the Three Kings,
virtue declined and righteousness thinned,
so they employed punishments to make the people fear them,
and thus conform to *rén* and *yì*.

As Zhuangzi said:
*"When it reached the Three Kings, the world was in great alarm."*

In the next age, down to the Five Hegemons,
great *wěi* (伪) flourished,
and cunning schemes were imposed upon the people,
while the lowly defied the high,
and punishments proved insufficient to deter them.

As Mencius said:
*"The Five Hegemons were but pretenders."*

*Rén* and *yì* were but expedients to save the age,
rooted in sincerity,
so when trust was insufficient,
there arose those who did not trust.

In the age of the Most High,
they acted in *wúwéi*,
valuing speech as *yóu* (犹),
and when deeds were done and affairs fulfilled,
the people said, *"This is natural."*
Yet their governance was not displayed.

When the Great Dao was abandoned,
the traces of *yǐ* (迹) and *yì* (义) became manifest.
With wisdom’s emergence,
great *wěi* arose—
for wisdom is the mind’s delusive thought,
and discriminating consciousness cannot unify the world.

In the age of the Most High,
subjects were naturally loyal and children naturally filial,
yet when the six relations were not in harmony,
it was because filial piety and kindness were now displayed,
and when the state was in chaos,
it was because loyal ministers were now displayed—
all because of pride in cleverness,
and the loss of spontaneity.

If one abandons the Sage and discards wisdom,
and governs through *wúwéi*,
the people benefit a hundredfold.
If one abandons *rén* and discards *yì*,
without altering human nature,
the people return to filial piety and kindness.
If one abandons cleverness and discards profit,
without seeing desire,
then thieves and robbers cease to exist.

The Sage, wisdom, *rén*, *yì*, cleverness, and profit—
these three pairs are the adornments of civilization,
so in governed ages, there are deficiencies.
Thus, Laozi established their counterparts.

To make people see their original, undyed nature,
if they can preserve it,
this is called *bàopǔ* (抱朴).
*Pǔ* (朴) is the Dao’s singular *qi*,
in humans called *xìng* (性)—
the mind’s singular essence.
To take purity and simplicity as its meaning,
and this as the standard—

Worldly folk, clinging to desires and entangled in objects,
generate private attachments,
and thus defile their original nature.
How then can they see the undyed?
Only by minimizing private desires.

What is minimizing private desires?
It is reducing cravings.

The One—
the true heart’s movement and also a kind of private desire—
Laozi does not say to eliminate desire entirely,
but to reduce it,
for the Way of governance takes the One as its standard.

When the people uphold the Way of reducing cravings,
this is called *dé* (德).
*Nurturing all things is called *rén* (仁);
*Rén* rescues safety and peril, called *yì* (义);
*Yì* has approaches and withdrawals, called *lǐ* (礼);
*Lǐ* adapts to change, called *zhì* (智);
*Zhì* is sincere and real, called *xìn* (信).

If the people embrace the Dao,
then the Five Constants and myriad virtues arise naturally,
and with the heart’s cravings reduced,
there is no capacity for artificiality.

Great is Laozi—
he makes the people return to their root,
and from there flow naturally,
teaching the world the Way of spontaneity.

*"Abandon learning, and there will be no sorrow."*

How far apart is the *yī* (唯) of assent
and the *ā* (阿) of dissent?
How different are good and evil?
What the people fear,
one must also fear.

Vast and boundless—
the hearts of the common folk,
rejoicing as if feasting on the grand sacrifice,
ascending the Spring Terrace in delight.
I alone am silent, my virtue not yet manifest,
like an infant before it smiles,
*chèngchéng* (乘乘), as if without destination.

The common folk all have excess,
while I alone seem bereft.
I, the heart of the foolish,
pure and unadorned.

The vulgar are bright and clear,
while I alone seem dim.
The vulgar are keen and sharp,
while I alone am muddled and still.

The gentle flow of water—
its motion like the sea,
the gusting wind—
like an unending breath.

The common folk all have means,
while I alone am stubborn and coarse.
I alone differ from others,
yet value seeking nourishment from the Mother.

All suffering arises from delusion,
so Laozi teaches to abandon delusive thought as learning,
thus there is no sorrow.

Yet to abandon delusion and return to the true,
or to abandon the true and chase delusion—
this is like the *yī* (唯) of assent
and the *ā* (阿) of dissent,
both emerging from the same heart,
how far apart are they?

Good and evil,
both emerging from the same nature,
how different are they?

What the people fear—
the galloping of delusive thought—
one must also fear.

Laozi sighed at the hearts of people,
endless and boundless—
observing the common folk’s joyful demeanor,
as if feasting on the grand sacrifice—
the grand sacrifice, an ox,
the offering to Heaven.
As if ascending the Spring Terrace in delight.

Laozi reiterated the intent of *"Abandon learning"*:
*"I alone am silent, my virtue not yet manifest,
like an infant before it smiles,
chèngchéng (乘乘)—
effortless and heartless,
as if without destination."*

The common folk’s thoughts never cease,
all in excess—
Laozi said, *"My heart alone seems bereft."*
Again he released it, saying:
*"I, the heart of the foolish,
without wisdom or gain,
only pure and unadorned."*

The vulgar deem brightness as clarity,
while Laozi said, *"I alone seem dim,"*
for my heart relies on nothing.

The vulgar deem sharpness as wisdom,
while Laozi said, *"I alone am muddled,"*
with no attachment to things.

The gentle flow of water—
its motion like the sea,
speaking of a heart unseen.
The gusting wind—
like an unending breath,
as wind moves through empty space,
with nowhere to rest.

The common folk all have means—
attached to things, generating thought.
Laozi said, *"I alone am stubborn and coarse,"*
not swayed by external objects.

Laozi said, *"I alone differ from others in that my heart aligns with the Void,
and I cherish seeking nourishment from the Mother.*

*The bearing of great virtue follows only the Dao.
The Dao as a thing—
only vague, only obscure.
Obscure and vague—
within it, there are forms;
Vague and obscure—
within it, there are things.
Mysterious and dark—
within it, there is essence,
its essence most true,
within it, there is verity.
From ancient times to now,
its name does not fade,
to measure all beginnings.*

*How do I know all beginnings are thus?
By this.*

Laozi speaks of the emptiness, the void—
the bearing of virtue is but one *qi*.
Thus it is said, *"only"* (as an interjection),
*"follows the Dao."*

The bearing of empty virtue—
this is the Dao’s transformation as a thing.
Its thingness is only vague,
its totality only vague—
vague as light and clarity, thus seeming to exist.
Obscure as having yet to manifest, thus seeming nonexistent.
This is so.

Speaking finely,
obscure and vague—
seeming nonexistent, seeming to exist—
within it, there are forms;
vague and obscure—
seeming to exist, seeming nonexistent—
within it, there are things.
The words *thing* and *form* share a meaning,
not fixed in speech—
emptiness within existence,
existence within emptiness,
thus they are spoken in repetition.
Vague-obscure is the thing,
the thing is vague-obscure.

As earlier stated:
*The formless form, the shapeless shape—
this is called vague-obscure.*
Vague-obscure is the undifferentiated *yuan-qi*,
the very heart of humanity.
When the heart clings, vague-obscure arises;
when the heart clings to nothing, it is mysterious and dark.

Laozi first speaks of the realm of the heart with attachment,
then clarifies the Dao without attachment.
Mysterious and dark—
the intent of *mysterious*,
the intent of *dark*—
within it, there is essence.
Not that within mysterious-darkness another essence exists,
but that mysterious-darkness itself *is* the essence.
Zhang Pingzhu said:
*"Mysterious-darkness, unfathomable—this is true essence."*

Its essence’s principle is most true—
speaking of its authenticity.
The vulgar take filth as essence—
this is the language of the artisans.
From the interplay of yin and yang,
blood and *qi* transform into whiteness,
like milk or curdled fluids.
This substance, shaped by sensation, has no fixed place—
in the body, it is sweat;
in the eyes, tears;
in the nose, mucus;
in the spleen, saliva;
in the kidneys, semen—
all generated by the heart’s attachment,
yet not true essence.

Again it is said, *"within it, there is verity"*—
from ancient times to now,
its name remains unlost,
can be used to measure,
to gauge all beginnings.
Laozi said, *"How do I know all beginnings are thus?"*
By this mysterious-dark Dao.

*What is bent becomes whole,
what is crooked becomes straight.
What is hollowed is filled,
what is worn becomes renewed.
What is little gains,
what is much confuses.*

Thus the Sage embraces *Oneness* as the model for all under Heaven.
Not self-illuminating, hence clear;
not self-righteous, hence manifest;
not self-praising, hence has merit;
not self-glorifying, hence endures.

Only by not contending
does Heaven and Earth not dare to act against it.
Was the ancient saying *"what is bent becomes whole"*
mere empty words?
Truly, it is whole and returns to it.

*What is bent becomes whole,
what is crooked becomes straight—*
how so?
To dwell in lowliness is to preserve fullness;
to be hidden is to endure.
Its virtue then endures anew.
For the Daoist,
to seek little is to gain,
to seek much is to err.

Thus the Sage embraces *Oneness* as the pattern for all under Heaven.
As in:
Not self-illuminating, hence clear;
not self-righteous, hence manifest;
not self-praising, hence has merit;
not self-glorifying, hence endures.
Though appearing roundabout and crooked in straightness,
it is by not contending.
Only by not contending
does Heaven and Earth not dare to act against it.

Laozi cites antiquity as proof—
the ancient saying *"what is bent becomes whole"*
was not idle speech.
Truly, it preserves the self and virtue returns to it.

Few words, yet natural—
gales do not last a morning,
sudden rains do not last a day.
Who does this?
Heaven and Earth.
Heaven and Earth, though unable to endure,
how much less humanity?

The Dao is a rare cessation—
speaking of naturalness.
Not natural, then affairs belong to contrivance,
thus gales and whirlwinds do not last a morning,
sudden and swift rains do not last a day.
Who does this?
Heaven and Earth.
Heaven and Earth, though they act,
cannot endure—
how much less humanity?

Thus those who follow the Dao:
those aligned with the Dao are aligned with the Dao;
those aligned with virtue are aligned with virtue;
those aligned with loss are aligned with loss.
Aligned with the Dao, the Dao is obtained;
aligned with virtue, virtue is obtained;
aligned with loss, loss is obtained.
Faith insufficient, there is doubt.
Thus those who follow the Dao:
the Daoist’s heart ever empty and still,
thus aligned with the Dao.
Those who follow virtue:
with one heart,
thus aligned with virtue.
If one focuses solely on benevolence and righteousness,
losing morality and virtue,
they align with the common loss.
Those aligned with the Dao obtain the Dao;
those aligned with virtue obtain virtue;
as for those aligned with loss—
relying on the Five Constants and a hundred virtues,
external virtue cultivates the self,
thus it is said even loss is obtained.
Those who lose morality and virtue
do so because their faith is insufficient.
Those who lose yet still claim virtue
are deceived by doubt.
The benevolent and righteous are the foolish vulgar.

*Those who stand on one leg cannot stand,
those who straddle cannot walk.*
The self-illuminating are not clear,
the self-righteous are not manifest,
the self-praising have no merit,
the self-glorifying do not endure.

As for the Dao:
*Excessive food and superfluous actions—*
things may hate it,
thus the Daoist does not dwell there.*

*Standing on one leg* refers to the heel not touching the ground—
the foot cannot long endure.
*Straddling* refers to riding—
things cannot long endure.
Thus the self-illuminating are not clear,
the self-righteous are not manifest,
the self-praising have no merit,
the self-glorifying do not endure.

「When the mind is applied to affairs,
it still cannot endure for long—
how much less when applied to the Dao?

If the mind clings to the Dao,
the Dao departs from the mind,
and where there is mind, there is obstruction.

It is like grasping food to achieve satiety—
once sated, one must depart from food,
yet it is said: *Excessive food and superfluous actions*
hinder one’s progress.
Even ordinary actions may be resented—
how much more so when applied to the Dao?

Thus, the Daoist does not dwell there.

There is a primal substance (*mixed and unified*),
born before heaven and earth,
silent and vast,
standing alone yet unchanging,
circulating endlessly yet never exhausted.
It may be called the Mother of all under heaven.

I do not know its name,
so I call it *Dao* and boldly name it *Great*.
*Great* is passing,
passing is distant,
distant is returning.
Hence, the Dao is Great,
heaven is Great,
earth is Great,
and the Sage-King is also Great.

Within the realm of the four Great ones,
the Sage-King occupies one.
Humans follow earth,
earth follows heaven,
heaven follows the Dao,
and the Dao follows the natural.

The Great Dao is *empty and void*.
*Empty and void* is without substance,
yet naturally gives birth to being.
All things under heaven,
from the myriad species to heaven and earth,
are born from the unified *qi* before the formation of yin and yang.

*Silent* means without sound,
*vast* means without form.
It stands above all things yet does not alter,
circulates through the six directions yet never ceases.
All things arise from this One—
it may be called the Mother of all under heaven.
Though it is said to have substance,
*silent* and *vast* are names without designation.

The *Laozi* says:
*"I do not know its name,
so I call it Dao and boldly name it Great."*
Extending the logic of *Great*,
one arrives at *passing*,
thus it is said: *passing away*.
Passing through the four directions and above and below,
its principle grows ever more distant,
thus it is said: *distant*.
When distant, it cannot be extended further,
so it returns to the One,
thus it is said: *returning*.

Since all things arise from this One,
the Dao is Great.
All things take form through yin and yang’s transformations,
thus heaven is Great and earth is Great.
It is also said that the Sage-King is Great—
meaning that *empty and void* is his domain,
and within this domain are the four Great ones,
while the Sage-King governs all under heaven through the Dao,
occupying one place.

Humans cultivate virtue through the Five Constants and myriad conducts,
yet they follow humility and modesty,
taking earth as their model.
Earth’s nurturing follows heaven,
heaven’s movement follows the Dao of unified *qi*,
and the Dao of unified *qi* follows the *empty and void* of nature.

Heavy is the root of light,
stillness is the master of agitation.
Thus the Sage-King never strays from his burdens,
though he enjoys splendor and comfort,
he rests in serene detachment.
How can the ruler of ten thousand chariots
consider himself lighter than the world?
Lightness will lose his ministers,
agitation will lose his rule.
Heavy is the root of light,
stillness is the master of agitation.

Speaking of governance,
the Sage-King who moves daily
does not abandon the weight of his supplies.
Though he enjoys splendor and comfort,
he depends on stillness to rest in harmony,
detached yet visible.
Light does not depart from heavy,
action does not depart from stillness,
the ruler does not depart from the people.
How can one sigh over the burdens of ruling
while holding oneself above the world?
Lightness toward the world will lose his ministers,
agitation of the people will lose his rule.

The virtuous walk without leaving tracks,
the virtuous speak without blemish,
the virtuous plan without calculation,
the virtuous close without locks yet cannot be opened,
the virtuous bind without cords yet cannot be undone.
Thus the Sage-King always practices these virtues to rescue people,
and there are none he abandons;
always practices these virtues to rescue all things,
and there are none he discards.
This is called *clinging to clarity*.

Hence, the virtuous are the teachers of the unvirtuous,
and the unvirtuous are the resources of the virtuous.
If one does not honor their teachers,
nor cherish their resources,
even if their wisdom is vast,
they are like great confusion.
This is called *essential subtlety*.

Those who walk the Dao virtuously leave no tracks—
this is called *walking without walking*,
walking, yet leaving no tracks.
Those who speak the Dao virtuously leave no flaws—
this is called *speaking without speaking*,
speaking, yet leaving no flaws.
Those who plan the Dao virtuously have no scheming thoughts,
thus they do not use calculations.
Those who close the Dao virtuously have no desires in their hearts,
so nothing can enter.
Though there are no locks or bolts,
it cannot be opened.
Those who bind the Dao virtuously understand
that the Dao is within the heart,
thus though there are no cords or constraints,
it cannot be undone.
Hence the Sage-King always uses these virtues to rescue people,
and there are none he abandons;
always uses these virtues universally to rescue all things,
and there are none he discards.
Thus, in self-benefit and benefit to others,
it is called *clinging to clarity*.
Therefore, the virtuous are the teachers of the unvirtuous,
and the unvirtuous gain from the resources of the virtuous.
Yet if one does not honor their teachers,
nor cherish their resources,
even if they are clever and resourceful,
they cling to confusion like the greatest delusion.
Without wisdom and without attainment,
this is called *essential subtlety*.

Know its masculine,
guard its feminine,
and you become the *crevice* of all under heaven.
To become the *crevice* of all under heaven,
one’s virtue never departs,
and it returns to the *baby*.
Know its white,
guard its black,
and you become the *model* of all under heaven.
To become the *model* of all under heaven,
one’s virtue is never forceful,
and it returns to the *Ultimate Void*.
Know its glory,
guard its humiliation,
and you become the *valley* of all under heaven.
To become the *valley* of all under heaven,
one’s virtue is complete,
and it returns to *primordial simplicity*.

Those who study the Dao
cannot yet fully grasp the *mindless* Dao—
they only know its masculine strength
and fail to guard its feminine softness.
The *Laozi* likens this to the *crevice* of all under heaven,
meaning to dwell low and not contend.
If one can become the *crevice* of all under heaven,
one’s virtue never strays,
and in time it returns to the *baby*.
The *baby* refers to
one who, upon seeing the world,
has no thoughts in their mind,
yet understands clearly of its own accord.
Guard its black and silent Dao,
and you may become the *model* of all under heaven.
*Model* also means
to conceal light and hide virtue.
If one can become the *model* of all under heaven,
one’s virtue is never errant,
and in time it returns to the *Ultimate Void*.

To know its glory yet not rejoice,
to guard its humiliation yet not grieve,
is like being the *empty valley* of all under heaven—
meaning to be void yet able to contain.
」

「能为天下谷，常保其德，乃具足，久则复归於朴。
To become the *receptive valley* of all under heaven,
ever preserving one’s virtue,
is to attain fullness—
in time it returns to the *Uncarved Block* (朴).

朴散则为器，圣人用之则为官长，音掌。
When the Uncarved Block disperses, it becomes *vessels* (器).
The sage employs it as *rulers and officials* (官长),
to govern with authority.

故大制不割。
Thus, the grandest institutions are not *severed* (割).

夫朴者，大道化生一熙也，散则为阴阳。
For the Uncarved Block is the single *radiance* (熙) of the Great Dao’s transformation,
when dispersed, it becomes *yin* and *yang*.

器显形谓之器之用，
Vessels manifest form—
this is their *application* (用).

四时之迁，始春而后秋，
The *passage* (迁) of the four seasons—
from the onset of spring to the arrival of autumn—

用之为法，
employing it as *principles* (法),

宗庙则以昭穆焉，
in ancestral halls, through the *order of seniority* (昭穆),

in court, through *rank and hierarchy* (尊卑),

乡党则以年齿焉，
among villages, through *age and seniority* (年齿),

推厚德则为之官长。
promoting those of great virtue to *rulers and officials* (官长).

是以先君后臣，先夫后妇，
Hence, one honors *sovereigns before ministers* (先君后臣),
and *husbands before wives* (先夫后妇).

故体大道之制，
Thus, the *framework* (制) of the Great Dao is upheld,

使人伦有序而不伤割害也。
ensuring human relationships remain ordered
without *violence or harm* (割害).

将欲取天下而为之者，吾见其不得已。
Those who seek to *seize* all under heaven and *act* (为) upon it—
I see that they cannot help but do so.

夫天下者，神化之器用也，而不可为也。
For all under heaven is the *manifestation* (器用) of the *Divine Transformation* (神化),
yet it cannot be *artificially shaped* (为).

为者败之，执者失之。
To *shape* it (为) is to *undermine* it (败),
to *grasp* it (执) is to *lose* it (失).

故物或行或随，或嘘或吹，
Thus, things either *move forward* (行) or *follow* (随),
either *draw in* (嘘) or *push out* (吹),

或强或羸，或载或隳，
either *flourish* (强) or *wither* (羸),
either *elevate* (载) or *destroy* (隳),

或成或败者，缘执於为。
either *succeed* or *fail*—
all because one *clings to artificial shaping* (执於为).

是以圣人治天下，所以去甚、去奢、去泰者，
Hence, the sage governs all under heaven by *removing excess* (甚),
*extravagance* (奢), and *profligacy* (泰).

上古以无为治天下，无不治矣。
In the *Highest Antiquity* (上古), the sage ruled all under heaven with *non-action* (无为),
and nothing remained ungoverned.

至尧舜时，道德势衰，
By the time of Yao and Shun,
the *virtue and power* (道德) of the Dao had waned,

迷七义欲民从之，

they sought to *compel* (从) the people.

救衰弊之世，

thus the *Laozi* says: *I see that they cannot help but do so.*

夫天下者，神化之器用也，
For all under heaven is the *manifestation* (器用) of the *Divine Transformation* (神化),

而不可为也，
yet it cannot be *artificially shaped* (为).

为者败之，执者失之。
To *shape* it (为) is to *undermine* it (败),
to *grasp* it (执) is to *lose* it (失).

故物事也或行或随或前或后，
Thus, things either *move forward* (行) or *follow* (随),
either *go before* (前) or *lag behind* (后),

或嘘或吹或阴或阳，
either *draw in* (嘘) or *push out*吹),
either *yin* (阴) or *yang* (阳),

缘执於为。

The **Dao** is originally nameless.
Though **primordial simplicity** (*pu*) is small,
nothing under heaven can subdue it.

If lords and kings could guard it,
all things would submit of their own accord.

When Heaven and Earth unite,
they descend sweet dew—
no one commands it,
yet all is evenly nourished.

At first, **institutions** were established,
and names were given.
But one must also know when to stop—
knowing when to stop is how one avoids ruin.

The **Great Dao** is empty and formless,
yet eternally nameless.
From **Primordial Oneness** (*yuan shi*), it transforms into **One Qi** (*yi qi*).
This **One Qi**—
existing yet unformed—
is called **primordial simplicity** (*pu*).
Though **primordial simplicity** is small compared to the **Great Dao**,
it is the mother of all things,
and thus nothing under heaven can subdue it.

If lords and kings could guard their **primordial simplicity**,
all things would submit and bow.

To govern the world with **Oneness**,
it is like Heaven and Earth’s qi uniting,
descending sweet rain and dew,
spreading universally—
no one commands it,
yet all is evenly nourished.

The **Great Dao**, through **primordial simplicity**, first established institutions and gave names.
Names having been given,
one must also know when to stop.
If one does not stop,
one will lose their **primordial simplicity**.
Knowing when to stop
is how one avoids ruin and endures.

The **Dao** in the world
is like rivers and valleys flowing toward the sea.
To know others is wisdom,
but to know oneself is enlightenment.
To overcome others is strength,
but to overcome oneself is power.
To know contentment is wealth,
but to act with resolve is to have purpose.
To lose one’s proper place is to perish early,
but to die without losing one’s nature is longevity.

The **Dao** in the world
is like rivers and valleys—
all waters flow toward the sea.
This illustrates how all things under heaven
ultimately return to the **Dao**.

To observe its methods,
to examine its path,
to discern its rest—
those who know others do so through wisdom,
but people mistake wisdom for enlightenment.
Instead, one should turn wisdom inward
and know oneself.
To know oneself and govern oneself—
this is called enlightenment.

To overcome others is to rely on strength,
strategy, wealth, and sharp influence—
but this is not true power.
Instead, one should still the force,
cultivate the heart,
and remain unmoved by all circumstances—
this is called power.

The world considers wealth as riches,
yet riches are finite.
But if one knows the heart’s original sufficiency—
its inexhaustible use—
this is called true wealth.

Worldly pursuits are all small ambitions,
but to act resolutely in the **Dao**
is to have true purpose.
Confucius had purpose in the **Dao**.

All actions aligned with the **Dao**
are thus enduring.
Though the body may die,
the nature does not perish.
To dwell in the realm of non-birth-and-death,
enduring through countless kalpas—
this is called longevity.

The **Great Dao** is vast,
and may be turned left or right.
All things depend on it for life,
yet it does not claim them.
When its work is done, it does not dwell on it.
It clothes all things yet does not rule them.
Thus, it is always without desire—
it may be called *small*.
All things return to it,
yet it does not know itself as master—
it may be called *great*.
Therefore, the sage can accomplish the great
because they do not consider themselves great.

Hold fast to this **Great Image**,
and all under heaven will come.
They come without harm,
and the world is at peace.

The **Great Dao** is vast—
it has no fixed position,
for it may be great or small,
and thus may be turned left or right.

What is meant by *small*?
The **Dao**—
all things depend on it for life,
yet it does not claim them.
Like spring’s work fully realized,
by summer, spring’s influence has faded.
In spring, all things are nourished,
yet it does not rule them.
Thus, the **Dao** is always without desire for things—
it may be called *small*.

What is meant by *great*?
All things return to the **Dao**,
yet it does not know itself as master—
it may be called *great*.
Therefore, the sage can accomplish the great
because they do not trace their actions to themselves.
Their work done, they do not dwell on it.
Because they do not claim greatness,
they achieve true greatness.

Hold this **Great Image** to govern,
and all under heaven will come.
The people come because they come without harm—
thus the world is at peace and harmonious.

Music and food are like bait for passing guests.
When the **Dao** is spoken of,
it is bland, without taste.
To see it, it is insufficient;
to hear it, it is inaudible.
To use it, it is inexhaustible.

The world indulges in the five tones of music
and the allurements of food,
yet in a hundred years, it is like waiting for a passing guest to stop.

When the **Dao** is spoken of,
it is bland, without taste.
Yet to see it, it is insufficient;
to hear it, it is inaudible.
To apply it in governing the state,
the family,
the self—
before birth, after death—
its use is inexhaustible.

If one would draw in the breath,
one must first exhale fully;
---

The one who would weaken it must first strengthen it;
The one who would discard it must first exalt it;
The one who would take from it must first give to it.
This is called **subtle luminosity**.

The yielding overcomes the rigid;
The weak overcomes the strong.

Fish cannot be lifted from the depths;
The state’s sharpest tools
should not be displayed to the people.

The one who would gather must first disperse;
The one who would weaken must first strengthen;
The one who would discard must first exalt;
The one who would take must first give.

Yin takes root in yang—
this is the inevitable order.

Those who grasp the logic of things
are said to possess **subtle luminosity**,
and thus know that yielding overcomes rigidity,
that weakness overcomes strength.

Fish cannot be separated from the depths—
just as the state’s sharpest tools,
once revealed, are like fish out of water.

When seals and decrees are issued,
when measures and scales are standardized,
these are the state’s useful tools.
Yet if one seeks to remedy flaws,
one must first allow corruption to flourish,
for failing to perceive the principle of **subtle luminosity**.

The **Dao** acts without action yet nothing remains undone.
If lords and kings could uphold it,
all things would transform of their own accord.

When transformation stirs to action,
I shall govern it with the **nameless Primordial**.
The **nameless Primordial** also desires nothing.

Without desire, all things settle—
and the world will align itself.

To govern the world,
one must act without acting,
and yet nothing will remain ungoverned.

If lords and kings could uphold non-action,
all things would transform of their own accord.
But if transformation gives rise to restless desire,
I shall steady it with the **nameless Primordial**.
The **nameless Primordial** also desires nothing.

Without desire, all things grow still—
and the hearts of the people will align themselves.

The highest virtue does not cling to virtue,
and thus has virtue.
The lower virtue does not lose virtue,
and thus lacks virtue.

The highest virtue acts without acting,
the lower virtue acts with effort.
The highest benevolence acts without effort,
the highest righteousness acts with effort.
The highest propriety acts with effort,
yet when none respond,
it resorts to force and compulsion.

Thus, when the **Dao** is lost, virtue arises;
when virtue is lost, benevolence arises;
when benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
when righteousness is lost, propriety arises.

For propriety is the thinning of sincerity and trust—
the beginning of chaos.

Premature wisdom is the flourish of the **Dao**,
the start of folly.

Thus, the superior person dwells in its depth,
not its shallowness;
in its reality,
not its flourish.
Hence, they discard the latter and embrace the former.

In the age of antiquity,
the highest virtue did not display its virtue,
and thus had virtue.
By the time of Fu Xi,
writing and marriage laws were established,
and virtue was made manifest—
thus becoming lower virtue.
Though it did not lose virtue,
it bore the traces of deliberate action,
and thus lacked virtue.

The highest virtue governs through non-action,
the lower virtue governs through deliberate teaching.
In the age of Yao and Shun,
the highest virtue loved people and benefited all,
acting as a benevolent ruler without effort.
In the age of the Three Kings,
the highest virtue established right and wrong,
distinguishing and acting—
thus with effort.
In the age of the Five Hegemons,
the highest virtue upheld ritual propriety in governance,
yet when ritual produced deceit and the people did not respond,
laws were enacted to make them fear punishment
and follow righteousness—
thus resorting to force and compulsion.

Thus, when the **Dao** is lost, virtue arises;
when virtue is lost, benevolence arises;
when benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
when righteousness is lost, propriety arises.

For propriety is a method to save the world,
rooted in sincerity,
yet arising from the thinning of trust—
the origin of chaos.

Those who prematurely display wisdom
are but the flourish of the **Dao**,
not its substance,
and thus their adherence to its flourish
marks the beginning of folly among the people.

Hence, the superior person dwells in the depth of sincerity,
not its shallowness;
in the reality of the **Dao**,
not its flourish.
Thus, they discard the shallow and the flourish,
and embrace the deep and the real.

In ancient times, those who attained **Oneness**—
Heaven attained **Oneness** and became clear,
Earth attained **Oneness** and became tranquil,
The spirit attained **Oneness** and became responsive,
The valleys attained **Oneness** and became full,
All things attained **Oneness** and flourished,
And the lords and kings attained **Oneness**
to govern the world aright.

Yet if **Oneness** were lost—
Heaven, without **Oneness**, would fear fracturing,
Earth, without **Oneness**, would fear upheaval,
The spirit, without **Oneness**, would fear stagnation,
The valleys, without **Oneness**, would fear exhaustion,
All things, without **Oneness**, would fear extinction,
And lords and kings, without **Oneness**,
relying on their noble height,
would fear their position toppling.

Thus, nobility finds its foundation in humility,
and height finds its base in lowliness.
Hence, lords and kings call themselves "lonely, few, and unworthy"—
is this not their grounding in humility?
Is it not so?

Thus, true praise is without praise,
not like jade clinking or stone clattering.
**Oneness** is the mother of all things;
all things arise from **Oneness**.
Thus, to attain **Oneness** is to flourish,
to lose **Oneness** is to perish.

The **Laozi** speaks:
In ancient times, those who attained **Oneness**—
Heaven attained **Oneness** and became clear, covering all;
Earth attained **Oneness** and became tranquil, bearing all;
The human spirit attained **Oneness** and became responsive;
The valleys attained **Oneness** and became full;
All things attained **Oneness** and flourished;
And lords and kings, attaining **Oneness**,
governed the world aright.

Yet if **Oneness** were lost—
Heaven, without **Oneness**, would fear shattering,
Earth, without **Oneness**, would fear eruption,
The spirit, without **Oneness**, would fear fading,
The valleys, without **Oneness**, would fear depletion,
All things, without **Oneness**, would fear annihilation,
And lords and kings, without **Oneness**,
relying on their noble height,
losing reverence and humility,
would fear their position collapsing.

The noble, though in high estate, takes humility as root;
The exalted, though in lofty place, takes lowliness as foundation.
Thus do lords and kings—
Calling themselves "orphaned" when fatherless,
"widowed" when husbandless,
"without grain" when lacking sustenance—
All to descend to the lowly.
Is this not taking humility as root?
Or is it that, recognizing their noble height,
They thus invite the loss of **Oneness** through excessive praise?

Praise, when excessive, becomes blame;
A foundation without praise is better.
Thus, one does not seek the **tinkling** of jade-like praise,
Nor the **clattering** of stone-like censure.

The **Dao** moves through inversion;
The **weak** is the **Dao**’s operation.
All things arise from **Being**, yet **Being** arises from **Non-Being**.
He who gallops his mind outward
Finds nothing compared to turning it inward—
Thus, inversion is the **Dao**’s motion.

Motion, when returned to **Non-Being**, is called **weak**—
The **weak** is the **Dao**’s operation.

The world knows only that all things arise from **Being**,
Yet does not know that **Being** arises from **Non-Being**—
Thus, the **Non-Being** is the **Dao**’s operation.

The **Superior Man**, hearing the **Dao**,
Diligently practices it;
The **Middle Man**, hearing the **Dao**,
Holds it as if it exists, as if it does not;
The **Inferior Man**, hearing the **Dao**,
Laughs at it—
And if he does not laugh, it is not the **Dao**.

The **Superior Man**, hearing the **Dao**,
Generates true faith and acts upon it—
Thus he is called **Superior**.
The **Middle Man**, hearing the **Dao**,
Has no resolve within—
Holding it as if it exists, as if it does not—
Thus he is called **Middle**.
The **Inferior Man**, hearing the **Dao**,
Burdened by dust and deep in deeds,
Hearing its teaching, does not adhere to any single principle,
Yet, full of virtue and **power**,
He laughs at it.
The **Inferior Man** who does not laugh at the **Dao**
Must be clinging to strange, contrived, artificial methods—
This is not the **Dao**.

Thus it is said:
The **Dao**, though bright, seems dim;
The **Dao**, though smooth, seems rough;
Advancing the **Dao** seems like retreat;
**Virtue** at its height seems like a valley;
Great **whiteness** seems like shame;
Ample **virtue** seems insufficient;
Established **virtue** seems like theft;
True **simplicity** seems corrupt;
The greatest **rectitude** has no corners;
The greatest vessel is fashioned last;
The greatest music is without sound;
The greatest form is without shape—
The **Dao** is hidden, nameless.

Thus it is said:
The **Dao**, though bright, seems dim—
For enlightenment brings no gain, thus it seems obscured.
The **Dao**, though smooth, seems rough—
For the great **Way** is plain and unadorned, requiring no cultivation or proof.
Advancing the **Dao** seems like retreat—
For it requires no contrivance of the mind.
**Virtue** at its height seems like a valley—
For the heart, vast as emptiness, contains all things.
Great **whiteness** seems like shame—
For action without effort appears as disgrace.
Ample **virtue** seems insufficient—
For the virtuous, perfect in all deeds, yet appear lacking.
Established **virtue** seems like theft—
For its actions leave no trace.
True **simplicity** seems corrupt—
*Semü*—change. The mind, serene and still,
Adapts to all things without resistance—
Thus it seems transformed.
The greatest **rectitude** has no corners—
For brothels and taverns become **Dao**’s sanctuaries.
The greatest vessel is fashioned last—
For only through diligent, sincere practice does one attain fulfillment.
The greatest music is without sound—
For supreme harmony is self-evident.
The above eleven lines speak of the **Dao**’s hidden, nameless nature—
Thus, the **Dao** is formless, beyond name.

Only the **Dao**,
Lends itself to **sound** and **completion**.
The **Dao** generates **Oneness**,
**Oneness** generates **Twoness**,
**Twoness** generates **Threeness**,
**Threeness** generates all things.
All things bear **yin** while embracing **yang**,
And through **suong-qi** achieve harmony.
Only the **Dao**,
Lends itself to **borrowing**—*dài*—
**Yin** and **yang** generate and transform,
Yet ultimately return to the **Dao**.
From the **Dao** arises **One Qi**,
**One Qi** divides to form **Two Principles**,
**Two Principles** generate and transform,
With **One Qi** as master,
**One** merging with **Two**—
Thus **Threeness**.
**One Qi** dwells within **yin** and **yang**,
Hence called **suong-qi**.
Through **Threeness**, all things arise—
Thus all things bear **yin** on their backs
And embrace **yang** toward their fronts,
All relying on **suong-qi** for harmony—
Harmony is the root of life.

What men detest—
Orphaned, widowed, without grain—
Yet kings and lords adopt as titles,
Thus things may be lost to gain,
Or gained to lose.
What men teach,
I also teach as **right**.
The **strong and violent** do not meet a natural end—
I shall take this as my lesson.

Why do men detest orphaned, widowed, without grain,
Yet kings and lords adopt such titles?
The **Way** of governing the world
Takes humility as law—
Thus things may be lost to gain,
Or gained to lose,
And one knows that the humble receive benefit—
This was the teaching of the ancients.

The **Master** said:
I too teach humility as **right**—
Why?
For those who rely on strength and violence
Do not fulfill their governance and perish.

The **Master** said:
I shall teach the **Way** of humility,
Taking this as my father’s lesson.

The **softest** in the world
Overcomes the **hardest** in the world—
Nothing enters where there are no gaps.
Thus one knows the benefit of **Non-Action**.

The teaching of **Non-Speech**,
The benefit of **Non-Action**—
Few in the world attain it.

The **softest** in the world
Is the **heart without heart**—
Yet deeper still is **Xuan**.
If one can wield this **softness**,
It becomes the **hardest** in the world—
Unbreakable.

The ancient hymn says:
*"No head to see, no hands to hold—*
*When the world’s foundation is laid, it knows no decay."*
Through **Non-Being** as **Being**,
One enters the realm of **Non-Birth-and-Death**,
Eternally enduring, without interruption—
Thus one knows the benefit of **Non-Action**.
This is a teaching beyond words—
The **Master** sighed:
The benefit of **Non-Action**—
Few in the world attain it.

Which is more intimate—**name** or **body**?
Which is more abundant—**body** or **wealth**?
Which brings greater harm—**gain** or **loss**?
Thus, the more one loves excessively, the greater the expenditure;
The more one hoards, the greater the loss.
Knowing sufficiency brings no shame;
Knowing when to stop brings no peril—
Thus one may endure.

Which is more intimate—**high name** or **body**?
Which is more abundant—**body** or **wealth**?
Gain and loss arise from **name** and **profit—**
Which brings greater harm?

Thus, the one who loves **name** excessively will inevitably incur great costs when **name** grows vast;
The one who hoards **wealth** will surely suffer great loss when **wealth** becomes abundant.
To dwell in **name** yet know sufficiency brings no shame,
To dwell in **wealth** yet know when to stop brings no peril—
Thus one may endure.

The great completion seems incomplete,
Yet its use is never exhausted.
The great fullness seems empty,
Yet its use is never depleted.
The great uprightness seems crooked,
The great cleverness seems clumsy,
The great eloquence seems tongue-tied.

**Yang** overcomes **cold** (by its vigor),
**Yin** overcomes **heat** (by its stillness),
**Qingjing** (purity and tranquility) is the **Dao** of the world.

Great completion is like inversion—
Thus it seems as if it were not fully realized,
Yet its use is never exhausted.
**Defeat** is like great fullness—
Thus it seems as if it were empty,
Yet its use is never depleted.

Great uprightness does not assert itself—
Thus it seems like crookedness;
Great cleverness conceals its wisdom—
Thus it seems like clumsiness;
Great eloquence does not speak—
Thus it seems like tongue-tiedness.

Hence, incompleteness can overcome completion,
emptiness can overcome fullness,
crookedness can overcome uprightness.
Clumsiness overcomes cleverness,
tongue-tiedness overcomes eloquence—
Just as **Yang** overcomes **cold** (when active),
**Yin** overcomes **heat** (when still).
This is like medicine countering illness,
and only **purity, tranquility, and Non-Action** can void all **realms** and achieve absolute cure—
Thus it is the **Dao** of the world.

When the **Dao** prevails in the world,
warhorses are turned back to till the fields;
When the **Dao** is absent from the world,
warhorses breed in the suburbs.
No crime is greater than **desire** for what is **obtainable**,
No calamity is greater than **greed** for what is **unknowable**,
No fault is greater than **covetousness** for what is **acquired**.

Hence, one who truly knows sufficiency is always sufficient.
The ancient **army** was the **peasantry**,
And the **peasantry** was the **army**—
When there was conflict, they fought;
When there was peace, they cultivated.
When the **Dao** prevails in the world,
the people each settle into their occupations,
and warhorses are turned back to till the fields.
Soldiers use their **excrement** to fertilize the fields,
and they attend to agricultural matters.

When the **Dao** is absent from the world,
warhorses multiply in the suburbs—
Thirty **li** from the royal **city** is the near suburb,
Sixty **li** from the royal **city** is the far suburb.
The cause of the absence of the **Dao** is this:

No crime is greater than indulging the **heart** in **desire** for what is **obtainable**,
No calamity is greater than gluttony of the **heart** in **unknowing** sufficiency,
No fault is greater than fixating the **heart** on **covetousness** for what is **acquired**.

Indeed, crimes, calamities, and faults all arise from **desire**.
If the **heart** is without **desire**,
Then one can know sufficiency—
Its sufficiency is always sufficient,
Whatever it encounters.
Calamities and faults are thus removed—
What crimes can there be?

Without stepping outside the door,
One knows the world;
Without peering through the window,
One sees the **Dao** of Heaven.

The more one strays far from it, the less one knows of it.
Hence, the Sage does not act yet knows,
Does not see yet names,
Does not do yet accomplishes.

The **Dao** uniformly permeates all things,
Yet its knowing lies within oneself.
To seek the **Dao**, one need not step outside the door—
Only reflect upon the mind,
For its essence is one with all things,
Thus one knows all things under Heaven.

If one can further abandon the traces of reflection,
With the mind free from attachments,
Then one need not peer through the window—
Even without outward gaze,
One sees the **Dao** of Heaven.

But if one seeks the **Dao** through calculations,
Through **yin-yang** [阴阳],
Through human affairs,
The farther one strays,
The less one knows.

Hence, the Sage does not act yet knows the nature of all things,
Does not see yet names what Heaven creates,
And remains without doing yet accomplishes all.

In learning, one gains incrementally;
In the **Dao**, one diminishes daily.
Diminish again and again,
Until one reaches **wuwei** [无为],
**Wuwei** yet accomplishes all.

Therefore, those who take all under Heaven,
Always act with **wuwei** [无事],
Yet when they must act,
Their actions are insufficient to take all under Heaven.

For those who learn, daily they strive for increase—
For those who seek the **Dao**, daily they diminish all entanglements.

Now, those who seek learning through increase have two afflictions:
The first is reading, reciting, and copying,
Holding onto many teachings—
This is called **fixation on things** [名着事].

The second is probing into textual meanings,
Exhaustively examining words and logic—
This is called **fixation on principles** [名着理].

These are all cases where the mind has attachments,
Thus they must be diminished.

Those who seek the **Dao** through diminishing also have two afflictions:
The first is severing delusive thoughts,
Seeking stillness outside the mind—
This is called **grasping at nothingness** [名执无].

The second is rejecting all dusty entanglements,
Exclusively guarding the mind—
This is called **grasping at somethingness** [名执有].

These are all cases where the mind clings,
Thus they must be diminished again.

Diminish the mind of learning and the mind of seeking the **Dao**,
Abandon attachments and clinging,
Until one reaches the **Dao** of **wuwei** [无为之道].
**Wuwei** is acting without a fixed mind.
Not without a mind—
It means the mind is devoid of all thoughts,
Called **wuxin** [无心].

Acting without a mind,
Naturally the senses are empty,
Listening and observing freely,
Spontaneously removing poverty and wealth,
Liking and disliking,
The toil of **yunshui** [运水], **banchaishu** [般柴役],
Moving through the world without encumbrance,
Thus **wuwei** yet accomplishes all things.

Hence, those who take and govern all under Heaven with the **Dao**,
Always act with **wuwei** [无事],
Yet when they must act,
Their actions are insufficient to take and govern all under Heaven.

The Sage has no fixed mind,
Taking the hearts of the people as their own.
The virtuous, I treat as virtuous—
The not virtuous, I also treat as virtuous,
Thus **virtue** is accomplished.
The trustworthy, I trust—
The untrustworthy, I also trust,
Thus **virtue** is trustworthy.

The Sage’s presence in all under Heaven,
Is like the sound of **"hunxin"** [浑心],
For the people are all focused on their ears and eyes,
While the Sage nurtures them like children.

The Sage acts with **wuwei** [无为], **wuwei** [无为],
Without fixed intentions in their actions,
Yet responds to affairs with the people’s hearts—
As the *Jiyu* [《击辞》] says:
*"Silent and unmoving, yet responsive—*
*Thus they naturally harmonize with all under Heaven."*

Their **virtue** is revealed through the affairs they encounter.
The virtuous, I treat as virtuous—
If there are the not virtuous,
The Sage does not distinguish,
Yet I also treat them as virtuous,
Thus **virtue** transforms the people into goodness.

The trustworthy, I trust—
If there are the untrustworthy,
The Sage does not distinguish,
Yet I also trust them,
Thus **virtue** transforms the people into trustworthiness.

Therefore, the Sage’s presence in all under Heaven:
If they doubt not the things,
Then all under Heaven’s things become trustworthy;
If they favor not the things,
Then all under Heaven’s things become public;
If they prize not the treasures,
Then all under Heaven will not gluttonously consume;
If they indulge not in excess,
Then all under Heaven will naturally follow frugality;
If they use what is true,
Then all under Heaven will not feign falsity;
If they exalt the humble,
Then all under Heaven will not contend.

Thus, the Sage’s **"hunxin"** [浑心] nurtures all under Heaven,
And the people all focus their **virtue** on their ears and eyes,
While the Sage remains in **wuwei** [无心] toward affairs,
Nurturing them like children.

Birth and death,
Those who live, thirteen in ten,
Those who die, thirteen in ten,
Even the people’s movement from life to death is thirteen in ten.
Why is this so?
Because of the **Dao**’s abundant nurturing of life.

The Master of Life Cultivation

It is said that those skilled in nurturing life
walk upon land yet meet no rhinoceros or tiger,
enter battle yet are unharmed by weapons.
The rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,
the tiger no place to strike with its claws,
the blade no place to lodge its edge.
Why is this so?
Because they dwell in no place of death.

Some in the world direct their minds outward,
taking Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang as their model,
practicing visualization, gargling, and breath control—
methods like *tuna* and *panrun*—
in their pursuit of longevity.
Others direct their minds inward,
sinking into emptiness and stillness,
becoming dim and lifeless as death itself.

Laozi spoke of ten parts as his standard:
Of those who live, three parts perish;
of those who die, three parts perish#1,
and of the people, some say "all beings."
The Confucian says: "The people are the sprouts of the myriad things."
Yet even among those who seek to nurture life,
three parts perish in the realm of death.
Laozi himself asked: If people nourish life with food and clothing,
why do they perish in the realm of death?
Because they cling excessively to the act of living itself.

Three threes make nine—
all who do not transcend:
those who live cling to being,
those who die cling to non-being,
and the people cling to phenomena.
These three cling to something with their minds,
all dwelling in the realm of life and death.

It is said that those skilled in transcending life
detach from external phenomena,
avoid the two extremes,
and have no attachment at all.
They do not fixate in the mind,
seeing as though not seeing,
coming as though not coming.
Body and mind are as one,
and thus they walk upon land yet meet no rhinoceros or tiger,
enter battle yet are unharmed by weapons.
The rhinoceros—like an ox, blue in color, weighing a thousand *jin*—
has no place to thrust its horn,
the tiger no place to strike with its claws,
the blade no place to lodge its edge.
Thus, fierce beasts and weapons cannot harm them.
Why is this so?
Because their minds are unattached,
and in sitting, standing, moving, or resting,
their minds remain ever empty and still.
Empty means without form,
still means without birth.
Because they are without birth,
they dwell in no place of death.

The Dao gives birth,
virtue nurtures,
things take form,
and circumstances complete them.
Thus, all things do not fail to honor the Dao and revere virtue.
The Dao’s eminence,
virtue’s nobility—
none can bestow these titles,
yet they remain ever natural.

The Dao gives birth and nurtures,
lengthens and matures,
completes and ripens,
nourishes and shelters.
It gives birth yet does not possess,
acts yet does not rely,
lengthens yet does not rule—
this is called the Mysterious Virtue.

All things arise from the Dao and are nurtured by virtue,
their forms shaped by the interplay of giving birth and nurturing,
and thus all things do not fail to honor the Dao and revere virtue.
Moreover, the Dao’s eminence,
virtue’s nobility—
their essence cannot be conferred by rank,
yet they remain ever natural.

Thus, all things are born, nurtured, matured,
completed, ripened, nourished, and sheltered by the Dao.
They arise from the Dao yet are not possessed by it,
are nurtured by virtue yet do not rely upon it,
are lengthened yet are not ruled—
none can bestow these titles,
yet they remain ever natural.
This is called the Mysterious Virtue.

Under Heaven, there is a beginning,
which is the mother of all things.
Having obtained the mother,
one knows her children.
Having known the children,
one returns to guard the mother.
Thus, one’s life will not perish.

Liezi said:
"All that has form arises from the formless."
Thus, the beginning of all things under Heaven is the formless,
and the formless is the mother of all things.
Having obtained the emptiness of the formless as mother,
one knows all things as her children.
Having known the children,
one must return to guard the mother.
If a person can harmonize their mind with the formless,
as a child returns to its mother,
then their life will not perish.

Close the orifices,
shut the gates,
and one will labor no more their whole life.
Open the orifices,
pursue affairs,
and one will never be saved their whole life.

To see small is clarity,
to hold fast to softness is strength.
To use its light,
and return to its clarity—
this leaves no calamity for the body,
and is called "following the constant."

The eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—
these are called the six gates.
Through the six gates, delusive afflictions arise,
and become the door to calamity.
Laozi taught to close the orifices—
the gates are the openings—
and shut the six gates’ doors.
When greed and delusion cease,
one labors no more their whole life.
If one opens the orifices,
pursues affairs,
and admits delusive afflictions,
one will never be saved their whole life.

The six gates take the mind as their root.
If the root is removed,
the phenomena will vanish on their own.
Thus, Laozi said:
"To see small is clarity"—
constantly without desire,
one may be called 'small.'
To hold fast to softness is strength.
The utmost softness under Heaven
responds to things and conforms to customs,
thus using its light.
Within, the mind is empty and still,
and thus returns to its clarity.
'To see small is clarity'—
clarity is like a lamp’s flame,
while light is its outward radiance.
To constrain it is called 'no loss of speech,'
to lose it brings calamity to the body.
Not losing speech is called 'following the constant.'

The Dao makes me distinctly aware—
*zhì* as knowledge, *xíng* as conduct—
and aligns me with the Great Dao,
only to fear its application.
The Great Dao is most level,
yet people prefer narrow paths.
The court is excessively cleared,
fields lie fallow,
granaries are empty,
garments are adorned with embroidery,
belts are girded with sharp blades,
feasts gluttonously indulge,
wealth is hoarded in excess—
this is called boasting of the Dao,
yet it is not the Dao at all.

Zhuangzi said:
"The Dao cannot be questioned,
and questions have no answer."
Thus, the Great Dao transcends speech
and cannot be sought through sight or hearing,
cannot be known through thought or discourse,
cannot be reached through language.
If one applies knowledge, conduct, or speech to the Dao,
then one may truly fear it.

Thus, Laozi said:
"The Dao makes me distinctly aware—
*zhì* as knowledge, *xíng* as conduct—
and aligns me with the Great Dao,
only to fear its application."
Truly, I tell you:
The Great Dao is most level—
plain and without action—
yet people pursue clever shortcuts,
striving for immediate results.
What of the times when courts vaunt cleverness and favor techniques,
when the Dao is neglected,
fields lie fallow,
granaries are empty,
people compete in ornate attire—
garments embroidered with green and white—
and gird themselves with symbols of power like sharp blades,
indulge in gluttonous feasts,
and hoard wealth for surplus—
this is called boasting of the Dao,
yet it is not the Dao at all.

Observing the Way of the age and applying these words—
thus it is worthy of fear.

What is well-established cannot be uprooted,
what is well-embraced cannot be abandoned.
Descendants continue through sacrifice without ceasing.

When cultivated in the self, its virtue becomes true;
when cultivated in the family, its virtue overflows;
when cultivated in the neighborhood, its virtue extends;
when cultivated in the state, its virtue flourishes;
when cultivated in the world, its virtue is universal.

Thus, one observes the self through the self,
the family through the family,
the neighborhood through the neighborhood,
the state through the state,
the world through the world.

How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

What is well-established in virtue is used without depletion,
what is well-guarded in virtue is held without loss.
Like descendants transmitting sacrifices without end.

When cultivated in the self, its virtue is true;
when cultivated in the family—if all in the family cultivate—its virtue overflows;
when cultivated in the neighborhood—if all in the neighborhood cultivate—its virtue extends;
when cultivated in the state—if all in the state cultivate—its virtue flourishes;
when cultivated in the world—if all in the world cultivate—its virtue is universal.

Thus, one observes the self through the virtue of self-cultivation,
the family through the virtue of family-cultivation,
the neighborhood through the virtue of neighborhood-cultivation,
the state through the virtue of state-cultivation,
the world through the virtue of world-cultivation,
transmitting virtue endlessly,
using it without depletion,
like descendants passing on sacrifices without ceasing.

Laozi said:
How do I know the world is thus?
By this virtue of self-cultivation.

*The True Scripture of Dao and Virtue: Direct Explanation, Scroll Three, completed.*

*The True Scripture of Dao and Virtue: Direct Explanation, Scroll Four*

**#1** *Xiaoqu Da* ["Small Taking Great" — *alternative reading: "Taking the Small to Obtain the Great"*]
**#2** *Suo gui ci Dao zhe, he shi ye* ["What does this Dao/Way value? — *this sentence may be a textual interpolation*"]

The depth of virtue/power is like that of an infant.
Venomous insects do not sting, nor do they bite sharply;
Fierce beasts do not seize it,
Nor do birds of prey snatch—*its grasp is firm and unyielding*.
Its bones are weak, its sinews soft, yet its hold is strong;
It knows not the union of male and female—*yet its essence is supreme*.
It cries all day without its voice breaking—*its harmony is perfect*.
To know harmony is to know constancy,
To know constancy is to know clarity.

To augment life is to bring auspiciousness,
To strain the *qi* by force is to make the body temporarily strong.
When things reach their peak, they grow old—
This is called *not-Dao/Way*,
And *not-Dao/Way* should be abandoned early.

The virtue/power of embracing and nurturing—
When its cultivation is profound,
Its conduct may be likened to that of an infant.
The infant, externally, has no attachments to things,
Internally, has no fixed desires.
Without desires, things cannot sway it—
Thus, venomous insects do not sting,
Fierce beasts do not seize it,
And birds of prey do not snatch its grasp.

The infant’s bones are weak, its sinews soft,
Yet it holds objects firmly with its hands;
It knows not the union of male and female—*yet its vital essence is supreme*.
It cries all day without its voice breaking—*its harmony is perfect*.
To know the infant’s state of no desires,
Its supreme essence, and its perfect harmony—
This is to know constancy,
And knowing constancy is to know clarity.

To fail to grasp this constancy,
To multiply means of augmenting life—
This is called *auspicious calamity*.
Or, to strain the *qi* by force,
To make the body temporarily strong—
This is a contrived method,
Not the true Dao/Way.

When the body is strong and the *qi* is strained,
It is like things relying on their vigor—
Vigor peaks, then decay follows—
This is called *not-Dao/Way*.
Not being the Dao/Way,
It should be abandoned early.

The wise do not speak,
Those who speak are not wise.
Close its *yue* ["cheek/jaw" — *metaphor for excessiveness*],
Shut its door,
Dull its sharpness,
Unravel its entanglements,
Blend its radiance,
Equalize its dust—
This is called *mysterious unity*.

It cannot be drawn near nor kept distant,
Cannot be used for gain nor for harm,
Cannot be exalted nor debased—
Thus, it is held in highest esteem by all under heaven.

Those who awaken to this themselves cannot speak of it;
If they indulge in speech, they do not know it.
To seek the Dao/Way that cannot be spoken,
One must merely close its *yue*,
Shut its door,
Dull the mind’s sharpness,
Unravel the world’s entanglements.
In action, blend its radiance,
In life, equalize its dust—
Constantly responding, yet constantly still—
This is called *mysterious unity of nature*.

Without hatred nor love,
Nearness and distance are naturally balanced,
Gain and harm are naturally removed,
Exaltation and debasement are naturally extinguished—
Thus, all things cannot be drawn near nor kept distant,
Cannot be used for gain nor for harm,
Cannot be exalted nor debased.
All causes cease,
Emotional perceptions are severed,
And it stands effortlessly alone—
Transcending all laws,
Thus it is held in highest esteem by all under heaven.

Govern the state with rectitude,
Employ the *Dao/Way*’s subtlety in warfare—*alternative reading: "strange/uncanny"*,
Gain the world through non-action.
How do I know this to be true?
Under heaven, many taboos exist,
Yet the people grow ever poorer.
Many sharp tools are wielded,
Yet the state grows ever more corrupt;
Many clever artifices are employed,
Yet strange/uncanny deeds multiply;
Laws and decrees grow ever more explicit,
Yet thieves and bandits proliferate.

Thus, the Sage says:
*"I act with non-action, yet the people transform themselves,
I love tranquility, yet the people align with rectitude,
I claim no action, yet the people grow rich,
I desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity.*
Its governance is veiled and indistinct,
Yet its people are pure and unadulterated;
Its governance is scrutinized and rigid,
Yet its people grow weary and rebellious.
Calamity, ah! is the reverse of fortune,
Fortune, ah! is the foundation of calamity.
Who can know their ultimate limits?
Is it not that they lack rectitude?"*

The rectitude becomes again the uncanonical and the strange,
The good reverts to the demonic.

The people’s confusion—
its duration has long since been established.

Therefore, the Sage is square yet does not cut,
honest yet does not sever,
upright yet does not overstep,
bright yet does not dazzle.

Rectitude is singularity.
When kings and lords attain singularity, they become the rectitude of the world—
thus it is said: *"With rectitude, one governs the world."*

Fortune, misfortune, regret, and blame arise from action,
but singularity alone can conquer and prevail—
thus it is said: *"With the uncanonical and singular, one subdues the world through warfare."*

Sunzi said: *"Thus, one takes the world with non-action."*

Laozi asked: *"How do I know this is so?"*

In the Zhou era, the world was rife with taboos,
people dared not speak of maladies below,
yet the people grew ever poorer;
many sharp tools were wielded for convenience,
and the virtue of the worthy was prized for cleverness—
thus the state grew ever more corrupt;
many clever artifices were employed,
yet useless excesses flourished—
thus strange and uncanny deeds multiplied;
laws and decrees grew ever more explicit,
yet virtue and moral cultivation were neglected—
the people knew no shame,
thus thieves and bandits proliferated.

Therefore, the Sage says:
*"I act with non-action, yet the people transform themselves,
I love tranquility, yet the people align with rectitude,
I claim no action, yet the people grow rich,
I desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity."*

Thus, to govern the world with non-action,
though its governance is veiled and indistinct,
it does not display its rule—
yet its people are pure and unadulterated, transforming themselves.

If one governs the world with action,
though its governance is scrutinized and rigid,
displaying its rule—
its people grow weary and rebellious, incomplete and unfulfilled.

To save the world with action,
is like the King Tang treating scabies—
temporarily a blessing,
yet scabies thrives because of the poultice.

Indeed, calamity is the reverse of fortune,
and fortune is the foundation of calamity.
Who can know the ultimate logic of their extremes?

「Indeed, those who govern the realm—do they lack rectitude?
Nowadays, the upright are deemed strange, while the perverse are praised as virtuous;
the people are long ensnared in confusion.
Thus, the Sage acts broadly without division,
pure and serene without harshness,
punishes wrongs directly yet does not indulge in retaliation,
and conceals brilliance without ostentation—
all these stem from the state of non-action.

In managing both human affairs and the Dao of Heaven,
nothing surpasses frugality.
Frugality is the essence of *early-complex*—
thus, *early-complex* is born.
*Early-complex* is called the profound embodiment of virtue and the accumulation of *power*—
accumulating *power* ensures nothing is unconquered.
If nothing is unconquered,
yet none know its limit,
then one can establish a state.
A state with such foundation
can endure long.
This is the Dao of deep-rooted stability,
long life and enduring vision.

If one governs with wisdom and discernment,
one loses the proper way—
nothing surpasses frugality.
To possess yet not use is called frugality.
Frugality is the origin of *early-complex* and rectitude—
thus, *early-complex* is born.
*Early-complex* is called the accumulation of supreme virtue.
As the saying goes:
*"Moderation (中庸), as a virtue, is it not supreme?"*
The people have long been few in virtue.
Accumulating supreme virtue ensures no task is unconquered.
To conquer all without haste,
yet none know its limit,
then one can establish a state.
Rectitude is the foundation of a state;
a state with such foundation
can endure long—
this is the Dao of deep-rooted stability,
the roots and foundation of wood,
which brings long life and enduring vision.

As for governing one’s own person,
one must embrace unity.
Unity is the origin of form—
this is the Dao of deep-rooted stability,
long life, abiding in the world,
preserving form, and enduring vision.
But if one takes unity as the law,
then no task is unconquered.

To govern a great state,
one must treat it as if boiling a small fish—
*[i.e., with gentle, non-intrusive care]*.
Those who govern the world with the Dao of non-action
have no fearsome ghosts.
Not that their ghosts are not fearsome,
but that their fearsome nature does not harm people;
not that their fearsome nature does not harm people,
but that the Sage also does not harm people.
When both do not harm each other,
then virtue returns in harmony.
To govern a great state as if boiling a small fish
means one must not disturb it.
Disturbing it harms the fish,
so those who govern with the Dao of non-action
do not harm the people.
As for ghosts and spirits harming people—
not only do the ghosts not harm them,
but the Heavenly spirits also do not bring pestilence, famine, or drought to harm them.
When spirits and ghosts do not harm people,
it is because the Sage governs with the Dao of non-action
and thus does not harm people either.
For when human and spiritual realms—
both hidden and manifest—
do not harm each other,
then non-action aligns with the virtue of Heaven and Earth,
ghosts and spirits—
virtue converges and returns in harmony.

Thus, those who govern the world with non-action
face no Heavenly resentment,
no human criticism,
no ghostly reproach.
A great state is the confluence of all lands,
the gathering of the world,
the receptive feminine principle of the world.
The feminine principle is ever victorious over the masculine through stillness,
and stillness is the yielding, receptive way.
Thus, a great state yields to small states,
and the small states submit to it;
a small state yields to great states,
and the great states embrace it.
Hence, sometimes yielding brings conquest,
sometimes yielding brings submission.
A great state seeks only to nurture and shelter its people—
this is the joy of Heaven.
A small state seeks only to serve and submit to others—
this is the fear of Heaven.
Mencius said:
*"Those who take joy in Heaven preserve the world,
those who fear Heaven preserve their own state."*
Both attain their desires—
thus, those in great states must not rely on strength,
but rather on yielding.

The Dao is the hidden mystery of all things,
the treasure of the virtuous,
and the refuge of the unvirtuous.
Fine words can be sold like goods in the market,
and noble deeds can be bestowed like the *xing* [杏] fruit.
If people are unvirtuous,
why would one abandon them?
Thus, when establishing a Son of Heaven,
and appointing the Three Exalted Ministers,
even if one is offered a jade tablet with a bow
or four horses in advance,
it is not as valuable as simply receiving this Dao.
Why did the ancients hold this Dao in such esteem?
Was it not because they sought it to obtain,
or pardoned crimes to escape?
Thus, it is held in esteem by all under Heaven.
The Dao is the hidden mystery of all things.
The virtuous cherish the Dao as a treasure,
while the unvirtuous rely on virtue as their refuge.
Thus, honoring the Dao as fine words,
following it can be as effortless as selling in the market;
virtue as noble deeds,
can be bestowed upon people.
If people do not embrace virtue and the Dao,
why would one abandon them?
Thus, like Yao yielding the throne to Xu You,
and setting him as Son of Heaven,
or Chu appointing Zhuang Zhou as Three Exalted Minister,
though invited with jade tablets and noble gifts,
though given carriages of ministers and the honor of horses,
they declined and withdrew—
this was not as valuable as simply receiving this Dao.

But why did the ancients esteem this Dao?
What was the reason they esteemed this Dao?
The reason they esteemed it
was that the heart harbors no desires.
They viewed honor and splendor as dust and filth,
and did not say,
*"I seek it to obtain,"*
or *"I cling to it to escape crime."*
Thus, it is held in esteem by all under Heaven.

To act without acting,
to do without doing,
to savor without savoring—
great or small, many or few,
repaying resentment with virtue.
The Sage acts without acting,
dwelling in the realm of doing nothing—
this is the virtue of serenity and ease,
its flavor without savoring.»

The great and the small—
speaking of their forms, many and few,
speaking of their numbers—
when clinging to dust and illusory attachments,
one can become the object of resentment.
Thus, acting with no mind,
it is said one repays resentment with virtue.

To tackle difficulty in its ease,
to achieve greatness in its smallness—
the difficult matters of the world must begin in ease,
the great undertakings of the world must begin in smallness.
Thus, the Sage never acts in greatness,
and so is able to accomplish greatness.

Those who seek to tackle difficulty
must first attend to its ease.
Those who seek to achieve greatness
must first attend to its smallness.

The world’s difficult matters must be done in ease,
the world’s great matters must be done in smallness—
thus, the Sage does nothing,
never acts in greatness,
and so is able to accomplish greatness.

Light promises bring few fulfillments,
many easinesses bring many difficulties—
thus, the Sage proceeds with difficulty,
and so in the end encounters no difficulty.

Light promises, once given, are seldom kept.
From many easinesses come many difficulties—
thus, the Sage responds to the world
by embracing difficulty,
and so in the end encounters no difficulty.

What is stable is easy to hold,
what is yet unmanifest is easy to plan,
what is fragile is easy to shatter,
what is subtle is easy to disperse.

Act before it exists,
govern before it is disordered.
A tree thick enough to embrace
begins as a sprout;
a nine-tiered tower
begins with a clod of earth;
a thousand-li journey
begins beneath one’s feet.

The doer brings about failure,
the grasper brings about loss—
thus, the Sage acts without acting,
and so knows no failure;
holds without grasping,
and so knows no loss.

Therefore, when the people engage in affairs,
they often ruin them when nearly complete.
If one treats the end as the beginning,
there will be no ruined undertakings.

Thus, the Sage desires without desiring,
does not prize hard-to-obtain treasures;
learns without learning,
to correct the errors of the common folk,
to assist the natural unfolding of all things,
and dares not act.

What is stable is easy to preserve when perilous,
what is yet unmanifest is easy to plan when already formed,
what is thin and fragile is easy to shatter and disperse—
for what is subtle is easily scattered.

All things must be acted upon before they arise,
governed before they are disordered.
A tree thick enough to embrace grows from a sprout,
a nine-tiered tower rises from a clod of earth,
a thousand-li journey begins beneath one’s feet—
all things grow from the subtle to the great,
and must not be neglected.

All who act bring about failure,
all who grasp bring about loss—
thus, the Sage acts without acting,
and so knows no failure;
holds without grasping,
and so knows no loss.

Therefore, when the people engage in affairs,
they often ruin them when nearly complete.
*Ji* is the subtle movement of the heart.
Before the heart moves, it dwells in the nameless void;
when *ji* moves, it reveals itself—
yet it is still not called *ji*.
*Ji* is when the heart first departs from the void and enters being,
the subtle threshold of desire’s beginning,
the start of all things.

If one treats the end as the beginning,
there will be no ruined undertakings.

Thus, the Sage desires without desiring—
cautious of the heart’s subtle stirrings.
Does not prize hard-to-obtain treasures—
cautious of the world’s subtle movements.
Thus, the Sage’s learning
does not rely on discerning *ji* to learn,
but corrects the common folk’s errors,
assists the natural order of all things,
and dares not act.

The ancients who excelled in the Dao
did not seek to enlighten the people,
but rather to make them simple.
The people are difficult to govern
because their cleverness is excessive.
Thus, governing with cleverness is the ruin of the state;
not governing with cleverness is the state’s blessing.
Knowing these two is the standard.
To always know the standard
is called the Mysterious Virtue.

The Mysterious Virtue is profound and distant,
contrary to the ways of things—
and only then does one attain the Great Harmony.

The ancients who excelled in the Dao and governed the world
did not use cleverness to enlighten the people,
nor cleverness to rule the world—
they sought to make the people simple.
The people are difficult to govern
because their cleverness is excessive.
Thus, governing with cleverness is the ruin of the state;
not governing with cleverness is the state’s blessing.
Knowing these two is the standard.
To always know the standard
is called the Mysterious Virtue.

The logic of the Mysterious Virtue is profound and distant,
contrary to the ways of things.
Not using cleverness to enlighten the people,
only then does one attain the Great Harmony of the world.

The rivers and seas become kings of the valleys
because they excel in yielding—
thus, they become kings of the valleys.

Therefore, the Sage who wishes to be above others
speaks from below;
who wishes to lead others
places himself behind.

Thus, the Sage stands above yet the people do not grow weary of him,
his voice resounds in front yet they are not harmed by it—
therefore, the world gladly follows his Dao and never tires.

Because he does not contend,
none under heaven can contend with him.

The rivers and seas so become kings of the valleys,
because they excel in dwelling below—
thus, they become kings of the valleys.

Therefore, the Sage who wishes to be above others
speaks in humility below;
who wishes to lead others
places himself behind, yielding to them.

Thus, the Sage stands above yet the people do not grow weary of him,
and leads yet they are not harmed—
because of his yielding and non-contention with all things,
none under heaven can contend with him.

All under heaven say my Dao is vast,
yet seems unorthodox.
Only because it is vast
does it seem unorthodox.
If it seemed orthodox for long,
then it would be trifling indeed.

Laozi says: *"All under heaven say my Dao is vast,"*
because it does not adhere to forms, names, or measures.
If it seems similar,
it will never truly be so.

It seems vast only because of the singularity of its *qi*—
yet when confined to forms, names, and measures,
it will never truly be so.

The ancients said:
*"Similar is similar, yet it is not the same."*

If it were truly the same,
it would be long since trivialized.

*夫* (this particle, emphasizing contrast),
students must discern:
if the heart harbors even a hair’s breadth of attachment,
thought, or calculation,
it remains within the realm of forms, names, and measures—
thus, the cycle of birth and death persists.
Hence, the ancient Sage left this sincere admonition.

I possess three treasures; I hold them fast.
The first is *cí* (compassion),
the second is *jiǎn* (frugality),
the third is *"not daring to be first under heaven"* (humility in action).

*Cí* (compassion) brings forth courage;
frugality brings forth abundance;
not daring to be first under heaven
allows one to fulfill great tasks and endure.

Now, abandon *cí* and take courage instead—
courage harms others.
Abandon frugality and take abundance instead—
abundance injures *virtue*.
Abandon humility and take being first instead—
others will resent you.

To harm others, injure *virtue*, and invite resentment—
this is the path of death.

When wielding arms,
compassion and non-contention are the Way of Heaven.
To use compassion in battle is upright;
to hold firm with compassion is steadfast.
If Heaven intends to save them,
it shields them with compassion.

The skilled warrior does not rely on force,
the skilled fighter does not rage,
the skilled victor does not contend,
the skilled leader places himself below others.

This is called the *virtue* of non-contention,
this is called the power of leading others—
both are called *"harmonizing with Heaven,"*
the ultimate *virtue* of antiquity.

The ancients spoke of wielding arms:
*"I dare not be the aggressor but only the defender,
nor advance an inch when I must retreat a foot."*

This is called *"having no path yet following the path,"*
*"brandishing no arms yet defending with arms,"*
*"confronting no enemy yet overcoming them,"*
*"grasping no weapons yet wielding them."*

No calamity is greater than underestimating an enemy—
to underestimate an enemy is to risk losing my treasures.
Thus, when two armies clash,
the one that shows compassion and pity will prevail.

My words are easy to know,
easy to practice.
Yet none under heaven can know them,
none can practice them.

Words have a root,
affairs have a master.
Only because of my lack of adherence,
none know my root.

Few know me,
so I am honored.
Thus, the Sage wears coarse garments while cherishing the precious Dao.

Laozi says:
*"My words are simple and direct, easy to know;
my actions require no force, easy to practice.*
Yet people, with their attachments and calculations,
seek to see, hear, do, and gain—
so none can know, none can practice.

This book speaks of *virtue* with its root,
discusses affairs with their master.
Only because of my lack of adherence to
the root of words and the master of affairs,
Laozi says, *"Thus, none know my Dao."*

Few know my Dao,
and they sigh: *"Then my Dao is noble—
the most exalted of all."*

Thus, the Sage wears coarse garments,
like the humble attire of the poor,
while inwardly holding the supreme Dao
as precious as jade.

Like jade hidden in stone,
only its outer form is seen,
rarely its inner worth.
To know what is unknown is noble;
to not know what is known is ill.

The Sage’s illness lies in his knowing of illness—
thus he does not fall ill.
The Sage’s freedom from illness comes from his knowing of illness—
thus he does not fall ill.

*The Scripture of Purity and Stillness* says:
To inwardly observe the mind is to know.
The mind without its own essence is ignorance.
To awaken to the mind’s lack of essence—
this is the noble way.

The Dao is the mind ever without thought or desire,
silently unaware of its own dwelling.
If one knows this, it is illness.
Only by recognizing knowing as illness
does one escape the hindrance of being known—
thus one does not fall ill.
The Sage’s freedom from illness comes from his knowing knowing as illness—
thus he does not fall ill.

When the people do not fear great authority,
great authority arrives.
Do not confine your dwelling,
do not weary of your birth.
Only by not wearying
does one not weary.
Thus the Sage knows himself but does not display himself,
loves himself but does not exalt himself—
so he discards the former and takes the latter.

The people, their hearts empty and still,
all phenomena naturally vanish—
thus they do not fear the threats of all things,
and know that great authority has come.

Admonish them: Do not cling to petty perceptions,
do not narrow your dwelling.
Do not resent dust and toil,
do not weary of your birth.
Only by not wearying
does one, though having a body for gain,
awaken to the truth of emptiness and constancy—
thus one cherishes oneself and does not weary.

The ancients said:
Though the five aggregates remain whole,
who knows where to seek the scattered bones afterward?
Thus the Sage knows himself but does not display himself,
is humble in love but does not exalt himself—
for pride is in self-display and self-exaltation.
So he discards that and takes this: self-knowledge and self-love.

To dare boldly is to court death;
to dare not to dare is to live.
These two—
one brings benefit, one harm.
What the Heaven detests—
who knows its reason?
Thus the Sage follows the difficult path.

The Way of Heaven,
though not contending, wins well;
though not speaking, responds well;
though not summoned, comes of its own accord—
open and yet well-plotted.
The Heavenly net is vast,
spread wide yet nothing is lost.

To dare boldly invites death—harm;
to dare not to dare brings life—benefit.
These two—
one brings benefit, one harm,
like what Heaven detests—
yet who knows its reason?
The principle of response and provocation—
thus the Sage follows the difficult path.

The Way of Heaven,
though not contending, yet wins well;
though not speaking, yet responds well;
though not summoned, yet comes in reply.
The Way of Heaven is open yet as if well-plotted,
so that good and evil cannot escape—
like Heaven’s net, though vast and wide,
punishes evil and rewards virtue without loss of a hair.

The people do not ordinarily fear death—
how can you use death to frighten them?
If you make the people fear death and act strangely,
I could seize and kill them—who would dare?
There are always those charged with killing who kill.
If you substitute for those who kill and kill,
it is like substituting for the master carpenter to hew—
if you do not substitute for the master carpenter,
few will avoid injuring their hands.

The people’s desires are naturally strange—
thus they do not ordinarily fear death.
How can you, with your lamentations and laws,
use death to frighten them?
If you make the people forget desire and always fear death,
and among them there are those who act strangely,
saying, *"I could seize and kill them to warn the crowd—who would dare?"*
Yet those who act strangely because of their desires
will inevitably invite their own calamity.
There are always those Heaven has charged with killing who kill—
why must you substitute for Heaven in executing punishment?
Not only do you harm living beings,
but you also disrupt the harmony of Heaven itself.
To substitute for those who kill is like substituting for the master carpenter—
the carpenter, substituting for the master,
labors with axe and adze—
few will avoid injuring their hands.
To rule the world with punishments alone
is rare not to stray from the Way.

The people’s hunger comes from their rulers’ excessive taxation—
thus it is difficult to govern the hungry.
The people’s difficulty in being governed comes from their rulers’ actions—
thus it is difficult to govern.
The people’s recklessness in facing death comes from their rulers’ excessive provision for life—
thus they treat death lightly.
Only those who do not overindulge in providing for life
are superior to those who value life above all.

In the Zhou era, the people’s hunger and insufficiency
came from their rulers’ broad consumption,
necessitating heavy taxation—
thus they were hungry.
The people’s stubbornness and difficulty in being governed
came from their rulers’ actions—
thus they were difficult to govern.
The people’s daring to risk death
came from their rulers’ excessive provision for life—
thus they treated death lightly.
Only those who do not overindulge in providing for life
are superior to those who value all life under Heaven.

Life is soft and weak,
death is hard and strong.
Grass and trees in life are soft and fragile,
in death they wither and decay.
Thus, the hard and strong are the companions of death,
the soft and weak are the companions of life.
Therefore, strong armies do not conquer,
rigid wood is easily split.
Thus, the hard and strong are lowly,
the soft and weak are exalted.

The Way of Heaven—
is it like drawing a bow?
The high are lowered,
the low are raised,
the excessive are diminished,
the insufficient are supplemented.
The Way of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the insufficient.
But the Way of humanity is otherwise:
it diminishes the insufficient to serve the excessive.
Who can diminish the excessive to serve the insufficient in the world?
Only the Dao can do so.
Thus the Sage acts without relying on it,
completes the work without taking credit—
does he not wish to be seen as virtuous?

The Way of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the insufficient,
yet the Way of humanity is otherwise—
it diminishes the insufficient to serve the excessive.
Who then can diminish the excessive to serve the insufficient in the world?
Only by following the Way of Heaven can this be done.

Thus the Sage follows the Way of Heaven,
acts without relying on it,
completes the work without taking credit—
is this not because he does not wish to be seen as virtuous?

Nothing in the world is softer and weaker than water,
yet in attacking the hard and strong, none can surpass it—
for there is nothing to replace it.
The soft overcomes the hard,
the weak overcomes the strong—
yet though all know this, none can practice it.

Therefore the Sage says:
*"To bear the nation’s defilement is called the Lord of the Soil Altars;
to bear the nation’s calamities is called the King of the World."*
Straight speech seems contrary.

Nothing surpasses the soft and weak like water,
yet in attacking the hard and strong, none can excel it—
to replace it is impossible,
for there is nothing to replace it.
Though all know that the soft overcomes the hard,
the weak overcomes the strong,
yet none can practice it—
for they cannot endure humiliation and remain soft.

Thus the Sage says:
*"When Tang and Wu spoke of the myriad regions as the Lord of the Soil Altars,
they alone called themselves ‘Orphaned, Aged, and Unworthy’—
able to bear the nation’s guilt upon themselves alone.
To bear the nation’s defilement is called calamity;
to bear the nation’s defilement is called the King of the World."*
This is straight speech aligning with virtue,
though the common folk see it as contrary.

To reconcile great grievances,
there must be lingering resentment—
how then can it be called good?
Thus the Sage holds only the left contract,
demanding nothing from others.
Therefore, the virtuous keep the left contract,
the unvirtuous demand the right.

The Way of Heaven has no favorites,
always aiding those who do good without action.
Tang expelled Jie, Wu Wang attacked Zhou,
yet in reconciling the world’s great grievances,
there would later be retaliatory wars.
With lingering resentment, how can it be called good?
Thus the Sage acts in non-action,
like holding the left contract—
the left contract is held alone,
the right contract is given to others.
The left and right contracts together form trust,
yet no demands are made of others.

The virtuous, like the keeper of the left contract,
receive things naturally—this is the Way of Heaven.
The unvirtuous, like the keeper of the right contract,
demand things to be fulfilled—this is the Way of humanity.
The Way of Heaven favors none,
always aiding those who act without doing.

In small states with few people,
let the people have ten or a hundredfold tools but not use them,
let them value death and not move far.
Though there are boats and carriages, they have no use for them;
though there are armor and weapons, they have no need to display them;
let them return to knotted cords for record-keeping.
Let their food be simple, their clothing plain,
their customs settled, their work joyful.
Though neighboring states are close enough to hear roosters and dogs,
let the people live to old age without visiting one another.

The heart is originally pure and still,
untainted by nature.
When desire arises in the heart,
it clings to the myriad things,
and once it clings, it gives rise to seeking.
Laozi wished for the world to have no desires,
no clinging to the myriad things—
thus in small states with few people,
let the people have tools for tens or hundreds,
yet those who could govern are not employed.
If the people have no songs,
their hearts are tranquil and at ease,
forgetting all matters of profit and loss,
thus valuing death and not moving far.
Without desire, there is no seeking—
though there are boats and carriages, they have no use for them.
Without desire, there is no strife—
though there are armor and weapons, they have no need to display them.
Returning to simplicity, they do not rely on writing or contracts,
letting the people live as in the age of the Three Sovereigns,
using knotted cords once more.
Without desire, they do not crave rich flavors yet find their food sweet,
do not adorn their clothing yet find it beautiful,
live in simplicity and find their customs settled,
do not envy others and find their work joyful.
Though neighboring states are close enough to hear roosters and dogs,
with no desires or seeking,
even if they meet, the people live to old age without visiting one another.

The ruler is content and unassuming, doing nothing,
the people are sincere and unassuming, doing nothing—
then why use tools for tens or hundreds?
Truthful words are not ornate,
ornate words are not truthful.
Truthful words lack the beauty of the common tongue,
ornate words are extravagant yet lack truth.
The good do not argue,
those who argue are not good.
The Sage of the Way acts rather than argues—
those who delight in argument do not act in goodness.

*The Analects* says:
*"The gentleman desires to be slow in speech and swift in action."*
The wise are not learned,
the learned are not wise.
The wise understand the heart’s nature,
not in vast knowledge or broad learning.
Those who pursue broad learning
often lack true understanding.

Confucius said:
*"Zigong, do you think I am someone who studies much and remembers it?"*
Zigong replied:
*"Yes, is it not so?"*
Confucius said:
*"No. I have one thread that runs through it all."*

The Sage has no accumulation—
the more he gives to others, the more he possesses;
the more he gives to others, the broader his Way becomes.
Confucius said:
*"You disciples think I conceal things?
I conceal nothing from my ears."*

The Sage has no accumulation,
wishing others to entrust him with care.
The more he gives to others, the more he gains;
the more he gives to others, the broader his Way becomes—
thus benefiting others while also benefiting himself.

The Way of Heaven benefits without harming;
the Way of the Sage acts without contending.

The *Daodejing* concludes with these two lines,
to complete its virtue.

The Way of Heaven benefits without harming;
the Way of the Sage acts without contending.

When Yuan Qing paid homage to Master Benlai, Deng Guang of Wangwu requested this text, wishing to engrave it for the world. Master Benlai said:

*"This book was written to remind myself of what I might forget. Now, people who read books on Dao and virtue often retreat and humble themselves, fearing they cannot practice it."*

Guang said:
*"When qi aligns with form and spirit, and one can grasp yin and yang, then life spans with Heaven and Earth—worn yet never ending. This is called the True Person (Zhenren).

If one takes the One as the principle and applies it to all things, then one may roam between Heaven and Earth, perceiving and hearing beyond the eight directions. This is the manifestation of pure virtue and the preservation of the Way—called the Perfect Person (Zhiren).

The next level takes yin and yang as the principle, follows the logic of the eight winds, and dwells in the harmony of Heaven and Earth. Within, there are no resentful, angry, or enraged thoughts. Thus, one may adapt to desires in the world and live to a hundred years or more—this is called the Sage.

If one models oneself after Heaven and Earth, resembles the sun and moon, and arranges the constellations and stars to create celestial texts, records the solar cycles, observes yin and yang’s reversals and compliance, establishes laws and calendars, and distinguishes the four seasons—this is called the Virtuous Person (Xianren).

The next level conforms to the Five Constants and a hundred virtues—this is called the Gentleman (Junzi).

To abandon the Gentleman’s conduct is to be a petty person (xiaoren).

From the True Person down to the Gentleman, none depart from the One qi, yin and yang, and human affairs—all are called virtue.

If you speak of the Great Dao of non-action before the One qi to those cultivating virtue, even the Three Worthies and Ten Sages would still harbor doubt—how much more so for petty people?

The Five Constants and a hundred virtues are already the virtues of human conduct; if people refuse to practice even these, how much more would they shrink from the Great Dao? What is there to fear?"*

Master Benlai said:
*"There was once a traveler who said: In the past, Wang Xu registered the *Daodejing*, yet died young. His father pursued his spirit and saw him wearing an iron shackle, saying, ‘I should not have registered the *Daodejing*, so I suffer this punishment.’ If this is true, then the book must be difficult to practice."*

Guang said:
*"Examining Xu’s registration, though it strayed from the Way, it was not entirely without virtue. If people followed its virtue, it could still benefit the world.

For example, Liu Qi composed musical chapters, collecting phrases from leisurely outings and discarded lines—merely capturing emotions and scenes, leading people to indulge in desires, chase pleasures, and drown in wine and lust, obscuring their true nature and burying morality. When heard in private chambers, it stirs emotions and provokes actions—peeping through cracks, scaling walls to follow one another, corrupting propriety. What difference is there between this and luring people into ravines?

To hold the office of a layer yet perform the deeds of a clown, claiming to be a scholar yet failing to uphold the Way of the Ancestral Teachers, leaving licentious words in the world to blind the ignorant—this is to invert the Way of the Ancestral Teachers. Moreover, which of these two bears greater guilt?

Those who deceive with false teachings invite slander upon themselves, while true teachings cannot be easily ruined. Why fear their ridicule?"*

Master Benlai said:
*"Even today, people are still amazed by wonders—like He Shang Gong ascending to Heaven, Liezi riding the wind, turning stones into gold, or going a year without food, with red faces and black hair. Such tales make people gaze in awe.

Yet I now live in poverty in a humble lane, my hair streaked with gray, selling medicine in the market, supporting my wife and children—just like everyone else. If I were to show this book to people, it would surely invite slanderous speech."*

Guang said:
*"The world speaks of Shun dwelling at Lì Shān, where the ox tilled and the birds weeded—this was the virtue/power of the Sage that moved and summoned them. 

Master Lù Guīméng replied:
*"This is a strange technique—how can it be called the virtue/power of a Sage?"

Confucius, recounting the text of Shun, said:
*"He expanded wisdom and refined culture—here the virtue/power of the Sage reached its limit. Why speak of such summoning? It is like the Great Achievement (Dàchéng) only after being recommended to Heaven.

Mencius said:
*"Emperor Yáo and Shun were no different from ordinary people, yet those who love sensational tales exaggerate their marvels—this is not the true intent of the Sage. For instance, when Emperor Wén of Hàn encountered He Shang Gong, the Master ascended to Heaven as described, rising a hundred zàng above the earth before speaking with the Emperor. If one could truly do this, it would be a strange technique—yet again, this is the exaggeration of those who love sensational tales.

Liezi could harmonize the Six Qi (liúhé) and merge with the luminous clarity (yījīngmíng), so that his mind became concentrated and his form dissolved, his bones and flesh entirely blending—floating east and west like a dry leaf or husk, yet he never knew whether the wind carried him or he carried the wind. The wind and I both forgot this distinction—how could he truly have walked upon the void and ridden the wind?"*

「Indeed. To ride the wind and walk upon the void is the art of lightness; to transmute stones into gold is the art of transformation; to abstain from food for years is the art of grain-cutting; to have a red face and black hair is the art of cultivation—all these are mere techniques, not the Dao/Way of virtue/power.

The true practitioner of the Dao/Way of virtue/power, like Liezi dwelling in Zheng, also had his fields to till. When Master Ziyang left him grain, Liezi refused it. His wife, pressing her heart in sorrow, revealed their poverty—yet he still had a wife and children. For forty years in Zheng, the ruler and ministers treated him like any commoner, indistinguishable from the vulgar masses. Yet the Dao/Way of virtue/power lies not in outward appearance, but in the mind.

The vulgar only judge by outward circumstances, yet they fail to grasp the heart. For instance, when Zhuangzi hosted Confucius and they encountered the bandit Zhi, Zhi assessed them by worldly affairs, so they could not escape the defamation of the petty.

The *Southern Blossom Scripture* says: "To speak of the Dao/Way but not follow its proper order is not the Dao/Way; to speak of the Dao/Way but not grasp its essence is mere idle quotation." Now, the Master before you established a ladder of virtue/power to reveal its order, and did not explain the Dao/Way through techniques and spells—this is worthy of attention.

To expound this *Scripture* directly, its language is plain yet its meaning profound; its examples are clear, its teachings explicit—yet the world has never seen such a work. If one claims to act solely for oneself, how did the Ancestral Teachers benefit others? Let me clarify the essential words: the Master, who sat in silence for long, then spoke: "Five thousand words, yet their essence lies in the two characters: *no desire* (无欲). The seeker of the Dao/Way must only keep *no desire* in their heart—this is the supreme Dao/Way.

Yet the meaning of *no desire* is exceedingly profound. Therefore, Laozi first speaks of *no desire* in his opening chapter; fearing students would cling to the idea of *nothingness*, he then speaks of *desire* (有欲); again fearing they would be ensnared by *desire*, he declares that the union of *having* and *not having* is called *mysterious* (玄); and again fearing they would fixate on *mysterious*, he adds *yet again mysterious* (又玄). Those who brush aside these four stages are said to enter the Dao/Way’s gate.

Yet students often cling to one of these stages and thereby fall ill. First, when students hear *no desire*, they seek to sever thoughts in their mind and attain *no desire*, not realizing that severing thoughts *is* desire itself—this clinging to *nothingness* is a sickness. Second, when they seek *desire* in their mind, they believe there exists something separate from the mind called *desire*—yet they fail to know that *desire* is the mind itself, and the mind is *desire*. The moment they hold onto the notion of *desire* within the mind, it becomes desire—this clinging to *having* is also a sickness. Third, when they force their mind to be still and concentrated, like a wooden statue, unmoving and tranquil—this clinging to *mysterious* is called the sickness of *both having and not having*. Fourth, when they brush aside the traces of *mysterious* and act without attachment, dissolving the duality of subject and object in their mind—this clinging to *yet again mysterious* is called the sickness of *neither having nor not having*.

All these above are entanglements of the mind, and they are all defilements—thus, they are sicknesses. Only when one’s mind is free of these four afflictions can they truly be said to have *no desire*.

Now, those who study the Dao/Way and annotate texts still cannot escape the realm of words, mistaking *mysterious* for the Dao/Way itself, and *yet again mysterious* as the gateway to all wonders—this is truly erroneous. To write of the Dao/Way, one must reveal its true teaching, which lies beyond these four stages. The Dao/Way is the gateway to all wonders, yet texts rely on words to convey it—how can one cling to words and claim to understand?

The student of the Dao/Way must only abandon the slightest trace of grasping thoughts. Their mind should be as vast as the bright sky, ever dwelling in emptiness, without a speck of dust. Light and clarity permeate all things, and then they respond to affairs as they arise—like clouds forming in the sky, appearing and disappearing without a trace, leaving no mark. Their mind is unattached to anything—this is called *virtue/power* (德).

It is said: *No taking, no discarding; no mundane, no sage; no single law to cultivate, no action to attain*—thus, it is called *ordinary mind* (平常心). The Dao/Way also says: *A single mind unborn, all dharmas are without blame*.

Students often doubt this, fearing they will fall into *emptiness*—so they turn back, gazing at the cliff. This is not falling into *emptiness*, but attaining the mind of *no mind* (无心). To truly grasp *no mind*, one is called a Dao/Way person (道人). The Dao/Way person stands above the True Person (真人), for the True Person clings to notions of subject and object in their practice, and thus remains below the Dao/Way person.

At that time, in the year *Gēnchén* of the *Shaoxing* era, a man from Yǐngchuān named **Chén Yuánqīng** recorded his words and appended them here.」
