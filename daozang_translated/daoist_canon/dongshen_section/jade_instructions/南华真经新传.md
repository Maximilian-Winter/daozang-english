**The Great and Venerable Master**

Virtue when full enters into the Dao.
The Dao is that by which all under heaven proceed.
Though heaven and earth are supremely vast, and the myriad things supremely numerous, all converge in unity.
This is why Zhuangzi composed the chapter *The Great and Venerable Master*, placing it after *The Sign of Virtue Full*.

Those who know what heaven does and what man does have reached the ultimate.
Heaven and man both issue from the Dao, and those who exhaust the Dao can know what heaven and man do.
What heaven does is non-action; what man does is action.
Non-action is quiescence, and quiescence restores life; action is movement, and movement has its principle.
To know this principle and the extremity of life is to be the master whom things revere.
Thus it is said: they have reached the ultimate.

To know what heaven does is to be heaven-born;
to know what man does is to nourish what one’s knowledge knows with what one’s knowledge does not know, and so complete one’s natural lifespan without dying prematurely—this is the flourishing of knowledge.
Yet there is peril.
Those who know what heaven and man do do so by knowing through unknowing.
Knowing heaven through unknowing is to penetrate the wondrous principle of non-action and the source of life;
knowing man through unknowing is to exhaust the ultimate of action and the supremacy of things.
When life reaches its source, one’s existence is spontaneous;
when things reach their supremacy, one becomes a companion of heaven.
Yet what man strives to know does not ascend, and so he relies on knowledge alone.
Relying on knowledge is to know excessively.
Thus it is said: this is the flourishing of knowledge.
Yet to rely on knowledge and know excessively is to harm life.
Thus it is said: though there is peril.

Knowledge depends on something to be fitting, but what it depends on is not fixed.
How do we know that what I call heaven is not man, or what I call man is not heaven?
Heaven is the congealing of qi, and man is the gathering of qi.
Zhuangzi, with his penetrating insight, knew that heaven contains man and man contains heaven, that heaven and man are one and undivided.
Thus it is said: How do we know that what I call heaven is not man, or what I call man is not heaven?

Only with a true person is there true knowledge.
What is a true person?
The true persons of old did not resist the few, did not dominate success, did not scheme for scholars.
In this way, they erred without regret and succeeded without self-satisfaction.
In this way, they climbed heights without trembling, entered water without getting wet, entered fire without feeling heat.
Such is the knowledge that ascends to the Dao.
One who merges with transformation, who is inwardly upright and does not rely on things, is a true person.
"True" refers to their nature, for with such a nature, their knowledge does not arise from human artifice.
Thus it is said: Only with a true person is there true knowledge.

True knowledge is unknowing.
Yet what makes a true person true is holding to compliance and awaiting the few, guarding the feminine and appearing deficient, neither scheming nor striving, yet scholars naturally gather.
Thus it is said: they did not resist the few, did not dominate success, did not scheme for scholars. How could such a true person err?
Even if they erred, they did not let gain or loss disturb their hearts.
Without disturbance in the heart, there is no heart for things.
Without a heart for things, one does not oppose them, and things cannot harm one.
Thus it is said: In this way, they erred without regret and succeeded without self-satisfaction.
In this way, they climbed heights without trembling, entered water without getting wet, entered fire without feeling heat.
This is not because true persons differ from others, but because they fully enter the Dao with true knowledge.
Thus it is said: Such is the knowledge that ascends to the Dao.

The true persons of old slept without dreaming and awoke without worry; they ate without relishing flavor and breathed deeply.
True persons are free from entanglements and forget emotions, which is why they slept without dreaming.
They delighted in heaven and knew life’s course, which is why they awoke without worry.
They savored the flavorless, which is why they ate without relishing flavor.
They returned to quiescence within quiescence, which is why they breathed deeply.

The breathing of true persons reaches their heels, while the breathing of ordinary people reaches only their throats.
Those who are cramped in submission speak as if choking; those whose desires run deep have shallow heavenly mechanisms.
The heels are the root of the body; the throat is the conduit of qi.
The root cannot be suddenly moved, nor can qi be long obstructed.
That true persons breathe to their heels means they can return to the root and be quiescent;
that ordinary people breathe to their throats is because their qi is obstructed as it exits.
Returning to the root and being quiescent, their breathing endures;
obstructed qi exiting, their breathing does not endure.
Endurance comes from forgetting desires; inability to endure comes from deep desires.

The true persons of old did not delight in life or detest death.
They emerged without joy and entered without resistance;
they came and went with effortless ease.
They did not forget their beginning nor seek their end.

Receiving it with joy, forgetting and returning to it—this is called not using the heart to abandon the Dao, not using man to assist Heaven. This is called the true person. Such a one: their mind is steadfast, their countenance serene, their brow broad and unadorned. Chill as autumn, warm as spring, their joy and anger flow with the four seasons, harmonizing with things without revealing their limit.

The true person lodges within the six bodily forms, takes ears and eyes as mere images, abides in timeliness and follows what is fitting—thus sorrow and joy cannot enter. Hence it is said: they do not delight in life or detest death. Wherever they go, nothing fails to respond; wherever they enter, they are at ease. Hence it is said: they emerge without joy and enter without resistance. Effortlessly departing, they wander beyond the realm of forms; effortlessly arriving, they dwell not within the realm of forms. Entering the Dao’s subtlety without forgetting their beginning, they merge with transformation and do not seek their end. Hence it is said: they do not forget their beginning. Not seeking their end, they attain ease without resentment. Hence it is said: receiving it with joy. Forgetting the self and returning to destiny—hence it is said: forgetting and returning to it. Thus, they follow the heart’s attainment without departing from the Dao, serve things according to their nature without overstepping their authenticity—this is the essence of true authenticity. Hence it is said: this is called not using the heart to abandon the Dao, not using man to assist Heaven; this is called the true person.

The reason the true person is thus: their true ruler is at peace and without care; their appearance is solemn and unmoving; their broad brow is unadorned and plain. Without anger, they command awe; without benevolence, they bestow love—harmonizing with the four seasons in their course. In ordering the ten thousand things, nothing is misplaced—who can fathom their ultimate limit? Hence it is said: such a one—their mind is steadfast, their countenance serene, their brow broad and unadorned—chill as autumn, warm as spring. Their joy and anger flow with the four seasons, harmonizing with things without revealing their limit.

Thus, when the sage employs military force, they may destroy a state yet lose no human hearts; their beneficence extends through ten thousand generations yet is not done out of love for people. Therefore, one who delights in harmonizing with things is no sage; one who has partiality is not benevolent; one who relies on timely advantage is not worthy; one who does not comprehend benefit and harm is no gentleman; one who pursues fame at the cost of the self is no scholar; one who loses the self yet is not true is no servant of others.

Those like Hu Bujie, Wu Guang, Boyi, Shuqi, Jizi, Xuyu, Ji Ta, and Shentu Di—these are servants of others’ service, followers of others’ paths, unable to follow their own. The true person, by contrast, uses the self to bury the ego, follows the Dao with the body; does not alter the inner, does not yield to the outer; employs things without being employed by them, follows nature without being constrained by it. Those like Hu Jie and Shentu Di could not bury the ego and thus lost their authenticity; could not follow the Dao and thus yielded to the times. Hence they were employed by things yet not truly free of them, followed nature yet not truly at ease—this is why they could not establish their destiny. Hence it is said: these are servants of others’ service, followers of others’ paths, unable to follow their own.

The true persons of old: their demeanor was upright yet not partisan, seemed insufficient yet did not defer, were yielding in their bearing yet not weak, expansive in their emptiness yet not ostentatious. Their joy was unassuming, their actions seemed compelled. They advanced my appearance with solemnity, restrained my virtue with reserve; their manner was worldly yet untamable. They seemed inclined to seclusion, forgetful of their words.

Taking punishment as their foundation, ritual as their wings, knowledge as their timing, and virtue as their guide: taking punishment as their foundation means their execution is lenient; taking ritual as their wings means they move through the world; taking knowledge as their timing means they act only when necessary; taking virtue as their guide means they accompany even those with feet to the hilltop—yet people truly regard them as diligent in conduct.

Punishment is Heaven’s punishment. Heaven’s punishment is Heaven’s mandate. All things have their mandate, and it is complete within me—this is what it means to take punishment as one’s foundation. Ritual is treading; when one treads the proper path, they arrive without walking—this is what it means to take ritual as one’s wings. Knowledge is awareness; when awareness is not stagnant, it moves with the world—this is what it means to take knowledge as one’s timing. Virtue is inner attainment; when one attains within, their conduct is visibly at ease—this is what it means to take virtue as one’s guide.

The death of self and other is but a fleeting departure—why cling to it? Hence it is said: taking punishment as their foundation means their execution is lenient. The Dao has no end, yet I tread it without ceasing—hence it is said: taking ritual as their wings means they move through the world. Moving with the world yet without intent in affairs—hence it is said: taking knowledge as their timing means they act only when necessary. Attaining within and acting with ease, even those with feet—where would they go but upward? Hence it is said: taking virtue as their guide means they accompany even those with feet to the hilltop. These four are not deliberately practiced by the true person, yet people truly regard them as diligent in conduct. Hence it is said: the true person is seen as diligent in conduct.

Thus, what they favor is one, what they do not favor is one. Their oneness is one, their non-oneness is one. Their oneness joins them to Heaven; their non-oneness joins them to man. The true person has no heart in their likes and dislikes—this is their oneness. The true person embraces the One yet is not bound by it—this is their sameness. Without heart and one, they follow nature. Hence it is said: they join with Heaven. Embracing the One and the same, they are sometimes made to act—hence it is said: they join with man. Heaven and man do not overcome one another—this is called the true person.

Life and death are fate; their constancy of night and day is Heaven. What man cannot partake in—these are the conditions of things. They take Heaven as their father and still cherish their own bodies—how much more should they cherish what transcends them? They take having a lord as better than themselves and still die for their own bodies—how much more should they die for what is true?

When springs dry up, fish find themselves together on dry land, moistening one another with breath, wetting one another with foam—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes. Rather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, better to forget both and be transformed by the Dao.

Praise and blame are but shifts in worldly conditions. Though the sage responds to them, their heart remains whole and untouched. As for those who abandon worldly conditions and insist that forgetting all is right—this is what Zhuangzi rejects, yet foolish Confucians instead reject Zhuangzi.

The great clod burdens me with form, wearies me with life, gives me ease in old age, and rest in death. Thus, to treat my life well is to treat my death well. The true person does not seek ease in old age or rest in death—this only describes the burden of form and the weariness of life.
