**Preface to the *Dao and Virtue Compendium***

I humbly observe that Fu Xi drew the *Yi* to reveal the Primordial Heaven, while Laozi composed his book to fully manifest the Dao and virtue. These two works may well be the ancestors of all scriptures. Yet today’s scholars, failing to grasp their principles—how lamentable! The fault lies in not receiving their true transmission.

I, though untrained in letters, sought widely and visited many masters until I encountered a perfected one who unlocked the *Yi* in my heart, allowing me to attain the subtleties of its profound meaning. Thereupon, I exhausted what I had gained and compiled the *Essence of the Three Heavens’ Yi*, which I transmitted to my disciples. Only Laozi’s *Daodejing* remained unmastered.

One day, a certain Chuan Ji’an brought me the *Precious Chapters on the Dao and Virtue* by the Perfected One of Purple Clarity. Upon examining its annotations, I found them largely in accord with the text, though some parts were incomplete. I wished to add my own glosses but hesitated after careful reflection.

Later, two or three disciples each presented several commentaries by various masters, seeking my instruction. Comparing them with the original scripture, I found many discrepancies: some had an extra word, others a missing word; some entire sentences diverged, or characters were corrupted. Each had its strengths and weaknesses, yet all differed.

I sighed: If even the original scripture is thus, how much more so the commentaries? When asked the reason, I replied: Initially, copyists made errors. Later, printing blocks had omissions or misalignments, and where earlier interpretations were unclear, later scholars arbitrarily added to them, perpetuating distortions and creating fragmentation.

Someone asked: Which version is correct?
I said: The *Zhangju* of Master He Shang and the *Precious Chapters on the Dao and Virtue* by the Perfected One of Purple Clarity are quite coherent.
Why?
Because those that align with the logical flow of the text above and below are correct.

What of the other interpretations?
Each reflects a different perspective, clinging to one aspect alone.

May I ask for details?
They stem from private conjecture, not flowing from one’s own insight, and thus cannot be broadly applied. Those versed in governance cling to governance; those in the alchemical Dao, to the alchemical Dao; those in military strategy, to military strategy; those in Chan, to Chan. Some speak of principle but not practice; others, of practice but not principle. As for expedient means, clever schemes, or roundabout paths, they fall into partiality and lose the Sage’s original intent.

Little do they realize that the Sage’s purpose in composing the scripture was to establish the ultimate before Heaven and Earth, to operate beyond yin and yang. In the space between covering and supporting, every affair and principle is complete—how could one cling to a single aspect and speak of it thus?

Thereupon, I ventured to speak, pointing out where others’ interpretations were incoherent or contrary to the Sage’s meaning, presenting them to my disciples. All agreed. Thereafter, seekers came repeatedly, leaving me no choice but silence. I proceeded to add annotations to each line of the original scripture, elucidating its meaning to verify the essentials of nurturing spirit and cultivating qi. For each chapter, I summarized its principle to clarify the sequence of investigating the root and exhausting the source. After each chapter, I composed verses to fully reveal the mechanism of illuminating the mind and seeing one’s nature.

As for the matters of cultivating the self, ordering the family, governing the state, and pacifying the realm; the regulations and laws; the daily concerns of the common people; and the path of ordinary conduct—whether vast or minute, broad or subtle, nothing is not encompassed within. I further composed two discourses, *Rectifying Words* and *Investigating Principle*, placing them at the scripture’s beginning to clarify proper terminology and thoroughly examine its meaning, thereby resolving the confusions of discrepancies in the text. I titled this work the *Dao and Virtue Compendium*, so that later learners may delve deeply and savor it, entering according to their understanding, and thus avoid falling into partiality, ultimately merging with the supreme Dao and returning to the origin.

Though my words are coarse and unrefined, I have done no more than provide straightforward explanations. I dare not claim the scripture’s meaning as my own. Yet compared to other versions, this may come closer. May those of like mind in later times take note.

**Prefatory Notes to the *Dao and Virtue Compendium***

**Rectifying Words**

Among the various versions of the scripture I have examined, only the edition by the Venerable He Shang is correct. Even the He Shang edition has three variants: one with He Shang Gong’s annotations, one with two complete commentaries, and one with the *Zhangju* in plain text. Among these, only the plain-text *Zhangju* of the Venerable He Shang is superior in principle, and I have followed it. I have thus exposed the erroneous interpretations of other versions to rectify their deviations. Beyond this, there are over two hundred instances of minor discrepancies, which I shall not enumerate here. This brief account suffices to dispel scholars’ doubts.

In Chapter Two, the six phrases beginning with "Being and non-being give birth to one another" should not each include the word *zhi* (之).
In Chapter Three, "Therefore the Sage empties their heart" should not be rendered as "the Sage governs," "governs it," or "governs it thus."
In Chapter Eleven, the six phrases beginning with "Embracing the One, can you not part from it?" should not each include the word *hu* (乎).
In Chapter Thirteen, "Favor is high, disgrace is low" should not be rendered as "favor is low," which contradicts the scripture’s meaning.
In Chapter Sixteen, "Cautious, as if crossing a river in winter" should not be rendered as "together with" (*yu*, 與) or omit *xi* (兮) in the following three of six phrases.
In Chapter Seventeen, "Next, they fear him; next, they revile him" should not be rendered as "they fear and revile him."
In Chapter Twenty, "Dim, as if obscured" should not be rendered as "bland, as if the sea."
"Valuing the mother of sustenance" should not be rendered as "the child values seeking sustenance from the mother."
In Chapter Thirty, some versions have three extra characters or one or two missing.
In Chapter Thirty-One, "Victory is not beautiful" should not be rendered as "thus it is not beautiful."

Some versions render "love and nurture" in Chapter Thirty-Four as "clothing and coverings"—this is incorrect. In Chapter Thirty-Six, dividing "softness and weakness overcome hardness and strength" into two phrases is wrong. In Chapter Thirty-Nine, "counting the parts of a chariot yet having no chariot" is sometimes misread as "counting praises"—this is also incorrect. In Chapter Forty-Nine, adding the particle *yi* (矣) after "virtue is good, virtue is trustworthy" is wrong. In Chapter Fifty-Two, "having served the mother, one knows the child" is sometimes misconstrued as "having known the mother, one further knows the child"—both versions are incorrect. In Chapter Fifty-Five, "excessive life brings misfortune" is sometimes rendered as "daily life" or "it is called life"—both are wrong. Chapter Sixty-Six contains several discrepancies in phrasing. In Chapter Seventy-One, "to know yet not know" is sometimes expanded to "to know yet not know is superior"—this is incorrect. In Chapter Seventy-Seven, "who can take their surplus to serve the world" is sometimes interpolated with "those lacking"—this is wrong. In Chapter Seventy-Eight, "nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water" is sometimes misphrased as "nothing is softer or weaker than water"—this is incorrect. In Chapter Eighty, "to cause the possession of tools for ten or a hundred yet not use them" is sometimes rendered as "ordering tools" or "not using them"—both are wrong.

**Investigating the Principle**
Examining the various editions and their interpretations, those that do not align with the Sage’s meaning are here exposed. The discrepancies and errors are numerous, and I do not wish to enumerate them all—scholars should reflect deeply on this.

*"Always without desire, to observe its mystery"*
Some punctuate this as a single phrase, "always without," or claim, "Those without desire preserve themselves; those with desire perish." If those with desire truly perish, why speak of "together calling it the profound"? Could perishing be called the profound? I say: "Without desire" means acting without contrivance, naturally. "With desire" means applying effort with intention. Non-action reveals the mystery of the nameless, preserving one’s nature. Action reveals the thoroughness of the named, preserving one’s life. Being and non-being, nature and life—these emerge from the same source yet bear different names, together called the profound, the profound within the profound. When being and non-being interpenetrate, nature and life are both fulfilled.

The *Record* states: "Before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure are expressed, it is called the Center. The Center is the great root of the world—this is the meaning of 'without desire, observe the mystery.' When expressed and all meet their measure, it is called Harmony. Harmony is the universal Dao of the world—this is the meaning of 'with desire, observe its manifestations.' Achieving the Center and Harmony, heaven and earth take their places, and the ten thousand things are nurtured—this is the meaning of 'the profound within the profound.'"

The term "desire" refers to desiring what others do not desire.

*"Not exalting the worthy"*
Some render this as "not seeking worthy scholars" or "not employing the worthy"—both are incorrect. If the worthy were truly not employed, this scripture would be unworthy of evidence, for such a principle could not exist.

*"The gate of the mysterious female"*
Some identify the mouth and nose as the gate of the mysterious female—this is wrong. Others suggest it refers to where thoughts arise—this is somewhat plausible but still does not align with the scripture’s meaning.

*"Bearing the *po*"*
Some interpret this as "soul and *po*," others as "yin and yang," and there are several other explanations—all are untenable. They fail to recognize that the *po* delights in movement; "bearing" it means to govern it.

*"Thirty spokes"*
Some explain this as the number of days in a month, others as the fire of cultivation—both are incorrect. They do not grasp that the Sage’s intent does not lie in the number thirty.

*"Cut off sageliness, abandon wisdom"*
Some claim sageliness and wisdom are insufficient and should be discarded—this is wrong. I say: the Sage does not employ sageliness and wisdom to be seen by the people.

*"Abandon learning, and there is no sorrow"*
Some take this to mean "abandoning learning is not learning"—this is incorrect. It means abandoning the learning of ordinary people to learn the non-learning of others. "Abandoning learning" means abandoning the learning of the world.

*"To close it, one must first open it"*
The explanations of various schools are incoherent. Some claim it refers to valuing flexibility—this is wrong. The highest Dao does not exalt the worthy; how could it value flexibility?

*"Rites are the head of disorder"*
Some hastily conclude that rites are not worth pursuing—I do not agree. If one can advance from rites to benevolence and righteousness, one nearly approaches the Dao.

*"Counting the parts of a chariot yet having no chariot"*
The explanations of various schools are incoherent. I say: counting the parts of a chariot, not one is called a chariot—this is a metaphor for my body, not one part of which is called "I."

*"Those who live are thirteen"*
Some claim that of ten parts, three are life and three are death, or that it refers to the seven emotions and six desires—this seems plausible but is not. Others suggest it refers to the four gates and nine orifices, which is even more wrong. Still others compare it to the waxing and waning of the moon as a metaphor for the fire of cultivation—this is also incorrect. For the explanation, see the main text of the scripture.

*"Do not narrow one’s dwelling"*

Previous interpretations fail to cohere. Some offer contrary explanations, claiming it refers to the formless spirit or to boundless vastness—both are incorrect. Others suggest it means "never weary of one’s life" or "never weary of the Dao," which is sheer delusion. Have they not heard the concluding line: *"Abandon that, embrace this"*?

I say: *"Do not narrow one’s dwelling"* still implies grasping at vastness and greed. *"Never weary of one’s life"* means defying great majesty and insatiable craving for life. The sage knows the self without displaying it, cherishes the self without exalting it, and does not indulge life—hence *"abandon that, embrace this."*

*"Those with virtue hold fast to the bond; those without virtue enforce thoroughness."*
Some claim *"彻"* means *"to penetrate,"* that the sages of antiquity were universally penetrating, nothing escaping their comprehension, while the people, lacking virtue, merely praised them. Such words are like eavesdropping through a wall—utterly unrelated to the scripture’s meaning.

I say: *"契"* means *"pledge"* or *"covenant"* (pronounced *qiè* in rhyme with *挈*). *"彻"* means *"thorough"* or *"pervasive."* Those with virtue uphold their covenant, while those without virtue enforce their clarity and thoroughness. For details, see the main text of the scripture below—those of insight should reflect deeply.

This scripture’s phrasing often employs rhyme:
*"朴"* rhymes with *"扑."*
*"阙"* (pronounced *zhá*) rhymes with *"察察."*
*"拔"* (pronounced *bá*) rhymes with *"脱."*
*"作"* (pronounced *zuò*, entering tone) rhymes with *"复."*
Such examples are numerous; their pronunciations are noted in the main text. Readers of this scripture must not cling rigidly to the literal meaning of the characters.

*Preface and Examples to the* **Collected Essentials of the Dao and Its Virtue**
*Collected Essentials of the Dao and Its Virtue, Volume One*

**Composed by Li Daochun Yuanfu of Qing’an, the Pure Toad Hermitage of Duliang**

**Dao**
That which can be spoken of as the Dao is not the true and constant Dao. The true and constant Dao begins in the beginningless, is named in the nameless. To conceive or discuss it is already to deviate; to open one’s mouth is already to err. If it could be spoken of, what would the Dao be? Since it cannot be spoken of, how then is the Dao to be perceived? If it is neither what can be spoken nor what cannot be spoken, how then is it to be realized? Should one manage to turn the phrase here, the work of inquiry is complete—if not, one must seek within the twelve hours of the day, in rising and resting, in eating and dwelling, in every moment of turning the mind, to examine and discern what it is that stands so steadfast, so vividly alive, never opposing any condition. Examine and discern again and again, until one reaches the point where examination and discernment fail—suddenly, as if grasping one’s own nostrils, the whole body breaks into sweat. Only then does one realize that this original thing has always been one’s own, unchanged since time immemorial. This is what is meant by the Dao, from which one cannot be parted even for an instant. Again, it is said: in walking, standing, sitting, and lying, one does not depart from this. How much more so between heaven and earth, where every thing and every phenomenon is this, from ancient times to the present, only this—giving birth to heaven and earth, only this. In daily life, in movement and stillness, in activity and rest, it is only this. All that has form will decay, but the nature of this remains constant. Even heaven, earth, and the void will decay, yet this alone does not. This alone cannot be seen through, though not for iron eyes or bronze pupils. Why can it not be seen through? Only because one has never truly encountered it face to face. Even if one were to encounter it face to face, one would still miss it. And where would one have missed it? Do not wander aimlessly—after all, how does one understand it? Here, it is perfectly clear, yet only lacks someone to bear witness to it. Should one meet a true friend, one would raise one’s brows and offer it up.

*Crack!* Last night, new rain passed by the riverbank;
This morning, the distant mountains remain as green.

**Verse:**
The ultimate of the Dao is emptiness, void, and stillness,
Without image, without form, without name, without substance.
It cannot be seen, cannot be grasped, cannot be heard,
Nor can its traces be found.
Vast, it encompasses all; subtle, it enters all.
It gives birth to heaven and earth, nurtures the ten thousand things,
Its transformations endless, its hiddenness and manifestation unfathomable.
It cannot be known by knowing, cannot be recognized by recognizing.
The Most High Laozi, whose tongue had no bone,
In this scripture, clearly revealed it.
Much speech leads to exhaustion—better to remain silent.
This is the end of doubt.

**Virtue/Power**
The word *virtue* is also a forced name, impossible to describe or grasp. Any contrivance, accumulation of merit, or layering of practice is not virtue. To remain thus, without cultivation, without effort, like dead ashes or withered wood, waiting for virtue to come of itself—one will have no virtue for a lifetime. The more one seeks virtue, the farther it recedes; the more one clings to it, the more it is lost. The scripture says: “The highest virtue does not act as virtue, and thus possesses virtue.” And again: “The highest virtue acts without acting and without purpose.” These two lines are abundantly clear—only lacking someone to bear witness to them. If one is truly faithful, one will overturn all prior learning, understanding, and knowledge—all the teachings of the Hearers and Pratyekabuddhas—and in the midst of ordinary practice, take up the word *diminish* and put it to use. Diminish again and again, diminishing until one reaches the point where nothing more can be diminished. Then, mysterious virtue shines forth, and one trusts that non-action is indeed beneficial. The scripture says: “The teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few in the world attain it.” And again: “Mysterious virtue is profound, far-reaching.” Do you understand?

*Hmm!* It does not depart from where it constantly abides,
Yet if sought, you will find it cannot be seen.

**Verse:**
The river-sands of wondrous virtues all reside within the mind.
No need for effort—why labor to cultivate and accumulate?
The more one delves, the deeper it becomes; the more one clings, the more it is lost.
Let go of all things, overturn all phenomena.
Put others before oneself, embrace the feminine, hold to the One.
Pure and undivided, one’s virtue becomes real.
Self-cultivation, family regulation, governance, and peace—all emerge from this.
Its wondrous function is immeasurable—this is called mysterious virtue.

**Scripture**
The word *scripture* is also a forced name. In the beginning, the sage saw that people followed illusions with their emotions, were deluded by desires, and true nature was lost amid the turmoil of karmic consciousness and the blazing of ignorance. Thus, the original heaven was forsaken, and people suffered premature death and injury, unable to return to their fundamental source. Therefore, using the power of skillful means, the sage opened the gate of good guidance, leading the deluded multitude back to the true Way. Thus, he composed books and established teachings, forcibly naming them *scriptures*. *Scripture* means *path*—the great road traveled by all. Yet those who read this scripture must not cling to the trance of language, nor should they abandon this scripture to seek elsewhere. One must turn one’s attention to one’s own being, carefully chewing over these five thousand words, examining each point and stroke, not letting anything slip by. Suddenly, when one thoroughly digests even a single phrase, this entire scripture resides within oneself. Only then does one trust that the opening of the Dao does not depend on the tongue. Here, one unlocks one’s own treasure store, brings forth one’s own scripture, wields it freely and without constraint. Not only this scripture, but all thirty-six revered scriptures and the entire canon of teachings—from beginning to end, with a single shout, one fully comprehends them all.

A storm rises from level ground,
A thunderclap splits the clear sky—
Listen carefully, listen carefully!

**Verse:**
This single scroll of scripture—
Its wondrous function is beyond praise.
Each person inherently possesses it,
Every thing is perfectly complete.
Straightforward and unobstructed,
Vast and unconfined.
Unchanging through kalpas,
Unaltered since ancient times.
Everywhere it functions,
Everywhere it serves as a thoroughfare.

Before the hand is raised, clarity is already distinct.
None but the true child of my house dares enter within.

"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao."
To open the mouth is already to err.
What name shall it be called?
That which can be named is not the eternal name.
To call it a thing is already to miss the mark.

Nameless, it is the Dao—
The beginning of heaven and earth,
Prior to all covering and bearing.
Named, it is forcibly called the Dao—
The mother of the ten thousand things,
Giving life without cease.

Thus, in constant non-desire, one observes its mystery;
In no-mind, transformation unfolds.
In constant desire, one observes its manifestations.
(Manifestation: *jiào*, pronounced as "call"—intentional manipulation.)

These two emerge together yet bear different names—
One substance, two functions.
Together they are called the profound,
For substance and function share a single source.
Profound beyond the profound,
Where form and spirit are both wondrous—
The gateway of the manifold mysteries.
From this arise the hundred thousand dharma gates.

**Chapter One**
The Dao of emptiness and natural constancy cannot be spoken.
The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.
It is the primordial ancestral qi,
The Dao that transforms and gives birth to all heavens,
Adapting to time and circumstance.

The Dao is originally nameless;
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
It is the name that shapes heaven and earth’s transformations,
Nurturing the ten thousand things,
Manifest in form and trace.

With an empty mind and non-action, one perceives the nameless mystery;
With an active mind, one perceives the named manifestations.
Mystery is spirit; manifestation is form.
To know manifestation but not mystery is imprecise;
To know mystery but not its thoroughness is incomplete.
Only when both are fully realized—
Form and spirit both wondrous—
Is it called "profound beyond the profound."
From this emerge the thirty-six revered scriptures,
The gateway of the manifold mysteries.

Where, then, does this scripture arise?
*Hah!*

**Verse:**
At Kunlun’s summit,
Within the primordial millet-pearl.
The mouth born of father and mother
Will never serve you truly.

When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises;
(For beauty is the cause of ugliness.)
When all know goodness as goodness, un-goodness follows.
(For goodness is the source of un-goodness.)

Thus, being and non-being give birth to one another;
Difficulty and ease complete one another.
(Ease: *yì*, pronounced as "ferment"—what is difficult becomes easy; what is easy becomes difficult.)
Long and short define one another;
High and low incline toward one another.
(Where there is height, there is lowness.)
Sound and echo harmonize;
(Where there is sound, there is harmony.)
Front and back follow one another.
(Before follows after; after follows before.)

Therefore, the sage forgets beauty and ugliness,
Abides in non-action,
Forgets being and non-being.
Practices the teaching without words,
Forgets difficulty and ease.
The ten thousand things arise without refusal,
Forgets things.
Born yet not possessed,
Forgets form.
Acts yet does not rely,
Forgets emotion.
Achieves yet does not dwell.
Forgets self.
Only by not dwelling does one remain true to one’s origin—
Thus, it does not depart.
(Depart: *qù*, pronounced in rising tone—
When all is forgotten, the true unity remains eternally.)

**Chapter Two**
Beauty and ugliness, goodness and un-goodness,
Like shadow following form, naturally depend on one another.
Even being and non-being, difficulty and ease,
Mutually rely and conceal one another.
Where there is beauty, there is ugliness;
Where there is goodness, there is un-goodness.
Thus, the sage neither refuses nor possesses,
Neither relies nor dwells,
Forgets both self and other,
Lets being and non-being dissolve—
And so remains eternally, never departing.

This chapter elucidates the meaning of embodying the Dao from the first,
Enabling the learner to understand the principle of "emerging together yet bearing different names,"
Neither clinging to function nor abandoning it,
Avoiding partiality and stagnation.

**Verse:**
People have beauty and ugliness;
I have no self or other.
All overturned—
A hundred bubbles return to water.
Though a thousand existences are pointed out before me,
I say within them there is not a single one.

Do not exalt the worthy,
Abandon sageliness and discard wisdom—
Let the people not contend.
(Forget self.)
Do not value rare goods,
Abandon craft and discard profit—
Let the people not steal.
(Forget things.)
Do not display what is desirable,
Turn things to respond to the moment—
Let the heart not be confused.
(Forget emotion.)

Thus, the sage empties the mind,
Preserves essence.
Fills the belly,
Preserves life.
Weakens the will,
Preserves spirit.
Strengthens the bones,
Preserves form.
Always lets the people be without knowledge or desire,
Emptying all that is possessed.
Lets those with knowledge not dare to act.
(Those who recognize the dharma fear.)
Act through non-action,
Still and unmoving—
Then nothing is not governed.
(Govern: *zhì*, pronounced as "hold"—
Responding, one penetrates all.)

**Chapter Three**
"Not exalting the worthy" continues the non-action of the previous chapter.
To not boast of one’s own worthiness is to make the people pure;
To not value rare goods is to make the people prosperous;
To not display what is desirable is to settle the heart.
The sage governs the world by taking self-cultivation as the foundation.

Emptying the mind and filling the belly—
These are the essentials of cultivation.
Empty the mind, then the will weakens;
Weaken the will, then knowledge ceases;
Cease knowledge, then forget self—
This is "not exalting the worthy."
Fill the belly, then the bones strengthen;
Strengthen the bones, then desire ceases;
Cease desire, then forget things—
This is "not valuing rare goods."
These two principles support one another,
Sufficient to complete essence and life.

**Verse:**
With a full belly, true constancy abides;
With an empty mind, the Dao naturally dwells.
No need to wield a blade—
With a laugh, the cosmos is settled.

The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible,
Like the great void, of one body with it.
Perhaps it does not fill.
(It does not overflow.)
Abysmal, it seems the ancestor of the ten thousand things.
(It does not display itself.)
Blunt its sharpness,
(Do not reveal its edge.)
Untangle its knots,
(Do not follow worldly changes.)
Soften its light,
(Do not shine alone.)
Blend with the dust,
(Do not assert oneself.)
Deep and still, it seems to endure.
(Constantly responding, constantly still.)

I do not know whose child it is—
It precedes the Supreme Emperor.
(Only the Dao is the body.)

These four chapters above speak of acting through non-action, thus following with *"The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible—perhaps it does not fill,"* which means it does not overflow of itself. One who does not overflow of himself must receive benefit. To blunt sharpness and untangle knots is to empty the center and forget the self. *"I do not know whose child it is—it precedes the Supreme Emperor"* transcends the bounds of emptiness and nothingness.

**Verse:**
Not knowing whose child it is,
How could one know it precedes the Supreme Emperor?
For you, I make it clearly known—
It was before the Great Ultimate was divided.

Heaven and Earth are not benevolent,
They act through non-action,
Treating the ten thousand things as straw dogs.
They nurture the ten thousand things yet do not claim mastery.
The sage is not benevolent,
Emulating Heaven,
Treating the hundred clans as straw dogs.
The myriad people return to him yet he does not claim mastery.

Between Heaven and Earth,
It is empty at the center,
Is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet inexhaustible in use.
Empty yet never depleted,
Without intent,
Moving yet ever more emerges.
Responding to change without end.
The more words are spoken, the sooner they fail—
It is better to guard the center,
To be empty at the center, and nothing more.

These five chapters above:
Heaven covers and Earth bears,
Transforming the people and nurturing things—
This may be called utmost benevolence.
To speak of "not benevolent" is to forget their origin.
The sage, in loving the people and governing the state, is likewise;
In cultivating the self and nourishing life, he is likewise.
This concludes the meaning of *"The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible."*

**Verse:**
Bottomless, it is called the bellows;
Three holes, it is called the flute.
Within, a single aperture—
No one can grasp it.
If one could grasp it, he would be lord,
Blowing forth soundless music.

*"The valley spirit does not die,"*
Empty and numinous, it does not fade.
This is called the Mysterious Female.
The Mysterious Female’s gate,
Opening and closing,
Is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
It generates Heaven and generates Earth,
Enduring ceaselessly, without rest or pause.
Its use is never forced,
Its application is inexhaustible.

These six chapters above:
*"The valley spirit does not die"*—
Empty and numinous, it does not fade.
Continuing the meaning of *"guarding the center"* from the previous chapter.
Empty and numinous, its transformations are boundless;
Yin and Yang are unfathomable.
Opening and closing without cease,
Coming and going without end—
None know its limit.
In movement and stillness, it is without flaw,
Without labor or effort,
Generating and transforming without end.

**Verse:**
Opening and closing in accord with Heaven and Earth,
This is the gate of the Mysterious Female.
Since there is no going out or coming in,
It alone is honored across the Three Realms.

Heaven and Earth endure without rest or pause.
The reason Heaven and Earth can be long and enduring
Is that they do not live for themselves—
Without intent,
Thus they can be long-enduring,
Unchanging and unshifting.
Therefore the sage emulates Heaven:
Placing himself behind, he finds himself ahead—
Forgetting the self.
Setting himself aside, he finds himself preserved—
Forgetting form.
Is it not because he is selfless?
Thus he accomplishes his self.
Because he has no self,
Thus he fulfills himself.

These seven chapters above:
Heaven does not act as Heaven of itself,
Earth does not act as Earth of itself—
Thus they generate without cease.
The sage does not act as sage of himself—
Thus he harmonizes his virtue with Heaven and Earth.
This continues the meaning of *"Its use is never forced."*

**Verse:**
The Dao is utterly empty,
This emptiness has no beginning.
Whoever penetrates this emptiness
Becomes one body with the Great Void.
The Tai Lake spans thirty-six thousand acres—
To whom would the moon in its waves speak?

The highest virtue is like water,
Abiding in lowliness with softness.
Water benefits the ten thousand things yet does not contend,
Adapting to square or round.
It dwells where the multitude disdain,
Able to embrace the foul and impure—
Thus it nearly approaches the Dao.
Near, level tone: in accord with the Dao.
Dwelling in good earth,
Benefiting things.
The mind is good when deep,
Receptive to things.
In giving, it is good with kindness,
Generating things.
In speech, it is good with sincerity,
Responding to things.
In governance, it is good with order,
Transforming things.
In affairs, it is good with ability,
Completing things.
In action, it is good with timing,
In harmony with things.
Only because it does not contend,
Thus it is without blame—
Things and self as one.

These eight chapters above:
Continuing the previous chapter’s *"Placing himself behind, he finds himself ahead."*
The meaning of water is to take softness, humility, and lowliness,
Benefiting things without contention—
Thus it is without blame.

**Verse:**
Without contention, the spirit is serene,
Naturally the qi is harmonious.
Let go of this little thing,
How many times has the Yellow River run clear?

To hold and fill it
Is not as good as stopping.
Already, yǐ tone: to cease.
Heaven’s Dao diminishes the full and benefits the humble.
To measure and sharpen it
Cannot be long preserved.
Measure, chǔi tone.
Earth’s Dao transforms the full and flows to the humble.
Gold and jade fill the hall—
None can guard them.
Ghosts and spirits harm the full and bless the humble.
Wealth and honor with arrogance
Bring their own misfortune.
Yí, departing tone; jiù, rising tone.
Human Dao detests the full and favors the humble.
When merit is achieved and fame is established,
Withdraw—
Gather and return.
Heaven’s Dao.
Heaven and Earth harmonize their virtue.

These nine chapters above:
*"To hold and fill it is not as good as stopping"* continues the meaning of *"The highest virtue is like water."*
*"When merit is achieved and fame is established, withdraw"* is the warning against fullness and the exhortation to humility.

**Verse:**
Hurrying forward, the shadow does not leave;
Returning, one falls into the pit.
Just now, stop where your feet stand—
The land becomes level and deep.
If you understand turning the body with a little effort,
Hiding or soaring are all at your will.

Carry the hun and po,
Do not let them wander recklessly.
Embrace the One—can you not let it go?
Two things mixed in harmony,
Like a mother carrying her infant.
Concentrate the qi to attain softness—
Can you be like an infant?
Pure and undivided,
Returning to simplicity and wholeness.
Cleanse and purify the mysterious mirror—
Can you be without flaw?
Not seeing, not hearing,
Dust-free and mirror-bright.
Love the people and govern the state—
Can you act without action?
Zhì tone: to govern.
Unmoving and unshaken,
The Dao flourishes and the times are clear.
The gate of Heaven opens and closes—
Can you be the female?
Going out to being, entering to non-being,
Without boasting or pride.
Understanding the four directions—
Can you be without knowledge?
Diminish cleverness, set aside wisdom,
Harmonizing light and blending with dust.
Giving life and nurturing,
Xù, entering tone.
Revolving the Four Virtues,
Nurturing the multitudes.
Giving life yet not possessing,
Achieving merit and fulfilling the Way,
Concealing traces and hiding form.
Acting yet not relying,
Forgetting its origin,
Silent and obscure.

Long yet not controlling—
*Long*, rising tone.
Retreating to leave room,
All entrusted to Heaven’s renewal.
This is called the Mysterious Power.

The Dao ascends, virtue is complete,
Detached from form, the True is preserved whole.

---

**Chapter Ten**
"Bearing the po-soul"—
Like a cart bearing goods, the po delights in movement,
In galloping, in hardness and sharpness—hence "bearing the po."
The po belongs to yin; when yin flourishes, it harms yang.
When emotions prevail, they enslave the nature.
Only by embracing the One without parting
Can one attain softness, flawlessness, non-action,
Femininity, and non-knowing—
Thus restraining the po’s unruly emotions.
When the po is subdued and yin dissolves,
The spirit is serene, the nature still.

"Giving life and nurturing"—
Giving life yet not possessing,
Forgetting its origin—
No need for restraint,
Naturally unmoving,
Like returning laden with treasures.
Thus, "bearing the po."
From "embracing the One" onward,
All speaks to the meaning of "bearing the po,"
Linking the previous chapter’s "achieving merit and withdrawing"
To the following chapter’s "thirty spokes share one hub,"
Which serves the cart’s function.

**Verse:**
Affairs resolve when the heart is empty—
Yet emptiness is most difficult.
In an instant of awakening,
After delusion, a thousand mountains lie between.

---

**Chapter Eleven**
Thirty spokes share one hub—
Like the myriad dharmas uniting in one mind.
Where it is empty,
Count the cart—there is no cart.
The cart’s use arises when spokes converge at the hub,
Completing the cart’s function.

Mold clay to make a vessel—
*Mold*, *shàn*, level tone.
Harmonizing earth to form a vessel.
Where it is empty,
Count the vessel—there is no vessel.
The vessel’s use arises from the union of water and earth,
Completing the vessel’s function.

Carve doors and windows to make a room—
Opening doors, hollowing windows.
Where it is empty,
Count the room—there is no room.
The room’s use arises when doors and windows allow passage,
Completing the room’s function.

Thus, being serves to benefit,
Using being to aid non-being.
Non-being serves as the function,
Using non-being to employ being.

---

**Chapter Eleven (continued)**
The hub’s convergence of spokes enables the cart’s use—
Just as all dharmas return to the mind,
The marvel of preserving the spirit whole.
Without spokes converging at the hub, how can it be called a cart?
Without dharmas returning to the mind, how can the spirit be realized?
The hub is empty within, allowing the cart to move;
The mind is empty within, allowing the spirit to adapt.
Thus, emptiness becomes the true benefit,
Being becomes the function of emptiness.
Emptiness and being communicate,
Coming and going without obstruction—
This is the meaning of "bearing the po" from the previous chapter.
When nothing remains to bear,
Hub and spokes are both forgotten,
The cart ceases to exist—
Just as when mind and dharmas are both forgotten,
The spirit returns to emptiness.
Vessels and rooms share this principle.

**Verse:**
A thousand iron walls,
Ten thousand silver mountains.
Turn the wheel of mechanism,
And pass straight through.
To know the path beneath the mountain,
Ask those who come and go.

---

**Chapter Twelve**
The five colors blind the eyes—
Eyes dazzled by color.
The five sounds deafen the ears—
Ears confused by noise.
The five flavors dull the mouth—
The mouth deceived by taste.
Racing and hunting madden the heart—
The heart driven by emotion.
Rare goods hinder conduct—
*Conduct*, falling tone.
The mind turned by things.

Thus, the sage tends to the belly, not the eyes—
*Tends*, falling tone.
The inner realm does not go out,
The outer realm does not enter.
Thus, rejecting that, embracing this—
*Reject*, *qù*, *qiāng-lǚ* cut.
Withdrawing sight, returning to hearing.

---

**Chapter Twelve (continued)**
The previous chapter expounded the function of emptiness—
When its function is empty, one is not dazzled by sounds and colors.
Thus, it is followed by "the five colors blind the eyes."
Colors, sounds, flavors, and things are all root-and-dust.
All worldly people are robbed by them,
Only the Daoist is not deceived.
Seeing, hearing, speaking, and acting—
Without ritual, do not engage.
Then the six thieves transform into the six spiritual penetrations.
Thus, rejecting that, embracing this.

**Verse:**
Seeing color, the spirit is unsteady;
Hearing sound, great harmony is lost.
Yet nothing is overturned—
With empty hands, the highest realm is built.

---

**Chapter Thirteen**
Favor and disgrace both startle—
Favor is the precursor of disgrace.
Valuing great trouble as one’s body—
Valuing is the beginning of trouble.

What is meant by "favor and disgrace both startle"?
Listen closely to what follows.
Favor is above, disgrace is below—
Favor is gain.
Thus, gaining it startles as if losing,
Losing it startles as if gaining.
This is called "favor and disgrace both startle."
So it is.

What is meant by "valuing great trouble as one’s body"?
A question.
Why do I have great trouble?
Because I have a body—
*Have*, falling tone, same below.
With a body comes trouble.
When I am without a body—
Forgetting form, free from burdens—
What trouble could I have?
Forgetting honor, free from trouble.

Thus, one who values the body for the world—
Those who set the body aside,
Those who value the body—
Can be entrusted with the world.
One who loves the body for the world—
Those who put the body last,
Those who cherish the body—
Can be relied upon with the world.

---

**Chapter Thirteen (continued)**
Following the previous chapter’s "tending to the belly, not the eyes,"
The meaning of forgetting the self.
Thus, it is followed by "favor and disgrace both startle."
Favor, disgrace, honor, and trouble are mutually dependent.
If one can anticipate trouble and guard against it,
There will be no trouble for a lifetime.
Extending this Dao to govern and pacify the world,
The world will forever be free from peril.
Those who rule a state and worry for the world as for their own bodies
Will have the world willingly embrace them without weariness.

**Verse:**
What disgrace is there in disgrace?
What honor is there in honor?
Guarding against faults in advance
Is still like traveling a path.
How much better to lay down the whole body,
Without gain or loss, without startling.

---

Invisible, it is called *yí*—
The great image has no form.
Inaudible, it is called *xī*—
The great sound is soundless.
Intangible, it is called *wēi*—
The Dao is hidden, without name.
These three cannot be further questioned—
How could they be explained?
Thus, they merge into one.
Different paths, same return.

Above, it is not bright—
Nothing is more hidden than the obscure.
Below, it is not dark—
Nothing is more manifest than the subtle.
Endless, it cannot be named—
Though it has structure, it truly has no name.

Returning to where there is no thing,
Concealing the self where no traces remain—
This is called "the form of no-form,"
Invisible yet intimately seen.
"The image of no-image"—
*Xiàng* read in the third tone.
Intimately seen yet not seen—
This is called "dim and indistinct."
Vast and boundless, deep and abyssal.
Approach it, yet its beginning is unseen—
No origin.
Follow it, yet its end is unseen—
*Hoù* read in the third tone.
No end.
Grasping the ancient Dao, non-action,
To govern the present’s being, to unify the ten thousand beings.
Knowing the ancient origin, non-action—
This is called the Dao’s discipline.
Through non-being, manifesting being.

**Right Chapter Fourteen:**
*Xī*, *yí*, *wēi*—the Dao’s utmost.
Merging into one, returning to the root.
Neither bright nor dark, harmonizing its light.
No image, no form, concealing its function.
The final line summarizes the preceding three chapters
And reveals the secret of the following one.

**Verse:**
This target of words is hard to grasp, hard to depict—
Eight-sided and flawless, without seam or crevice.
Dim and indistinct, yet within the obscure there is image—
Who could discuss such subtle truths?

The ancients who were adept as scholars
Preserved its formless state:
Subtle, wondrous, profoundly penetrating,
Pure, luminous, and bright—
So deep it cannot be known.
Look for it, yet it is not seen.

Just because it cannot be known,
We force descriptions upon it—
*Qiang* (read in rising tone):
With being, we meet non-being.

Cautious, as if crossing a river in winter,
Chill piercing to the bone.
Wary, as if fearing neighbors on all sides—
Vigilant in solitude.
Solemn, as if ice about to melt—
Without doubt.
Simple, as if uncarved wood—
*Pǔ* (like one dull of wit).
Vast, as if an empty valley—
Hollow within.
Turbid, as if muddied waters—
*Hún* (read in level tone),
One with the dust.

Who can stir the turbid to slowly clarify?
Clarity is the source of turbidity.
Who can remain still to slowly quicken?
Stillness is the mechanism of movement.

Those who preserve this Dao do not seek fullness—
Emptiness is the root of fulfillment.
Only by not being full,
Can one be empty and receptive.
Thus, the worn does not become new—
Burying brilliance, leveling ornament.

**Right Chapter Fifteen:**
Continuing the meaning of the Dao’s discipline from the previous chapter.
Illuminating for later learners:
Preserve sincerity, cultivate reverence,
Always be vigilant in solitude,
Do not cling to appearances but embrace the One,
And abide in emptiness in daily practice.
When all conditions suddenly cease,
And the myriad illusions melt away—
Stir it, and it does not become turbid;
Settle it, and it does not become clear.
This is called "subtle, wondrous, profoundly penetrating"—
Deeply hidden.

**Verse:**
Subtle, wondrous, profoundly penetrating,
Turning with the tread of men.
Blindfold the eyes,
And nothing is seen.
Better to return—
Recognize the face of the Void Sovereign.

Attain utmost emptiness,
Guard deep stillness.
Motionless and serene—
Yet the ten thousand things arise together,
And I observe their return.
Observing return, one knows transformation.

The things, teeming and diverse,
Each returns to its root—
Movement at its extreme reverts to stillness.
Returning to the root is called stillness,
Returning to the source.
This is called "restoring life’s mandate"—
The vitality of life resides here.
Restoring life’s mandate is called constancy—
Abiding thus through kalpas.
Knowing constancy is called illumination—
Lucid through past and present.

Not knowing constancy—
Deluded and confused.
Acting recklessly brings misfortune—
A grievous error.
Knowing constancy, one is all-embracing—
Greatness admits no exclusion.
Embracing, one is impartial—
Impartiality is kingly.
Impartial, one transforms all things—
Kingly, one accords with Heaven.
Accord with Heaven, one accords with the Dao—
How could there be an end or limit?
The Dao is enduring—
Inexhaustible.
Though the body perishes, it does not cease—
Though heaven and earth change, this does not change.

**Right Chapter Sixteen:**
Continuing from the previous chapter’s "adept as scholars."
Attaining emptiness and deep stillness,
Restoring life’s mandate and returning to the root—
All is wondrous and divine,
All converge here with discerning eyes.
The work of learning is complete.
If not yet so, delve further into the final lines.

**Verse:**
Attain emptiness to know the wondrous root,
In deepest stillness, see the heart of Heaven.
Grasp the meaning within,
And all the sands of the river are gold.

The Highest—
No height surpasses it.
Below, people merely know of its existence—
All acknowledge its presence.
Next are those who draw near and praise it—
To be near and praised is not natural.
Next are those who fear it—
Aware of its awe and reverence.
Next are those who insult it—
Utterly without restraint.

When trust is insufficient, the Dao is hard to believe—
Some do not trust.
Doubt runs deep.
Thus, it treasures its words—
Light promises, few fulfillments.

When merit is accomplished and fame achieved,
Silently it is brought to fruition—
The hundred clans all deem it their own nature,
Unaware of its origin.

**Right Chapter Seventeen:**
"The Highest" means no height surpasses it.
Though even the lowest know of this principle,
They may draw near—
Yet praise renders it unnatural.
Those who fear it are but a step removed,
While those who insult it have strayed far from the Dao.
Heavenly truth is lost,
Unable to return to the source—
Though taught, what benefit is there?
The more words, the less trust.
Better to remain silent and await it,
Act without contrivance and transform,
Allowing them to awaken on their own,
Naturally returning to simplicity—
Unspoken, yet trusted.

In terms of governance:
Below the Highest, none can act without contrivance.
Drawing near and praising—
This is teaching with words.
Those who fear it—
This is the restraint of punishment.
Those who insult it—
The ruler has lost trust.
When the ruler loses trust in the people,
The people do not trust in return.
Thus, it treasures its words—
Teaching without words.
Teaching without words,
Accomplishing without contrivance—
Punishment is unused, yet the people submit.
When merit and fame are achieved,
And simplicity is restored,
Nearness, praise, fear, and insult are all forgotten.
The hundred clans live in peace, delighting in custom,
Forgetting their origin—
Thus, they say, "We are naturally so."

**Verse:**
The Highest has no height above,
Yet abides in daily use.
Pity the blind fools,
Who claim it emerged from the Han Pass.

When the great Dao declines, there is benevolence and righteousness—
Once the great simplicity scatters, benevolence and righteousness arise.
When wisdom and cleverness emerge, there is great deceit—
*Chū* (read in departing tone):
Wisdom and intelligence—
Rooted in the dust of the senses and karmic consciousness.
When the six relations are not harmonious, there are filial children—
Better to abide in constant harmony.
When the state is dark and chaotic, there are loyal ministers—
Better to abide in constant order.

**Right Chapter Eighteen:**
Continuing the meaning of nearness, praise, fear, and insult from the previous chapter.
Rather than a chaotic state revealing loyal ministers,
Why not act without contrivance so the people transform themselves?

**Verse:**
Cleverness obscures the great root,
Wisdom loses heavenly truth.
Without affairs, abide in constant clarity—
Carefree and joyful.

Abandon sagacity, discard wisdom—
Act without contrivance.
The people’s benefit is a hundredfold—
At peace and still.
Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness—
Act without intent.
The people return to filial piety and compassion—
Harmonious and compliant.
Abandon skill, discard profit—
Act without desire.
There are no thieves or bandits—
Contentment is constant.

**Verse Nineteen:**
Unfolding the essence of the preceding chapter.
When sagacity, wisdom, benevolence, righteousness, skill, and profit are all abandoned and no longer employed,
The people follow this transformation and return to simplicity.

The Sage, fearing later scholars might prove unequal to the burden,
Attaches to it the principle of ease and plainness:
"Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity,
Be without cunning, without guile.
Reduce self-interest, diminish desire.
Forget things, forget the self."

**Verse:**
Let not the three minds run wild,
Nor permit a single thought to rage.
Sights, sounds, knowledge, and perception—
No longer subject to reflection.

Abandon learning, be without care.
No affairs weigh upon the heart.
*Wei* and *ah*—
How far apart?
Not far.
Good and evil—
How distant?
Vastly so.

What people fear,
One cannot but fear.
Good and evil are to be feared.
How boundless and unending!

The common folk bustle and rejoice,
As if feasting at a grand sacrifice,
As if ascending a springtime terrace—
Insatiable in their cravings.

I alone remain still, without sign,
Like an infant who has not yet learned to smile—
Serene and desireless.
Adrift, as if with no place to return.

Flowing with natural spontaneity,
The common folk all have excess,
While I alone seem to lack—
Those driven by greed and striving are ever anxious,
Those who forget scheming are ever joyful.

How muddled is this heart of mine!
Turbid and still,
Dim and silent.
The common folk are bright and clear,
While I alone seem benighted;
The common folk display their treasures outwardly,
The sage conceals illumination within.
The common folk are sharp and discerning,
While I alone remain dull and obscure.
Dull as a closed gate.
The common folk make distinctions,
The sage knows no "this" nor "that."

Vague as dusk,
Unknowing, unperceiving.
Drifting as if without destination,
Nothing grasped, nothing clung to.
The common folk all have their uses,
While I alone seem stubborn and coarse.
The common folk all possess abilities,
The sage alone appears without skill.

I alone differ from others,
Not taking the ten thousand phenomena as companions,
Yet I prize feeding at the Mother’s breast—
Prizing the savor of the Dao.

**Chapter Twenty**
To "abandon learning" is to relinquish all that one possesses,
Thus it follows the abandonment of the sage.
The common folk devote themselves to learning matters,
Augmenting what they have heard,
Ever fearful their progress is not refined—
Thus they are ever anxious.
The sage discards all possession,
Devoting himself solely to savoring the Dao,
As one seeks nourishment from the Mother,
Abiding in femininity and embracing the One—
Thus he is without care.
This is called "abandoning learning to be without care."

**Eulogy:**
The moment one speaks of abandoning learning,
The mouth has already erred.
Vast knowledge and wide discernment
Lead one further astray unawares.
Though all worldly affairs are forgotten,
One still falls into the second mechanism of another’s design.

The bearing of great virtue
Accommodates all without exception,
Following only the Dao.
At ease within the dharma.

The Dao as a thing—
Only vague, only elusive.
The Heaven of original nature.
Elusive, yet within it there are images;
This is the undifferentiated Heaven.
Vague, yet within it there are things;
This is the luminous Heaven.
Dark and deep, within it there is essence;
This is the enduring Heaven.
Its essence is utterly real,
Pure and without falsity.
Within it there is sincerity—
Vibrant and alive.

From ancient times to the present,
Its name has never departed,
Ever abiding through kalpas.
By this, the myriad beginnings are surveyed.
How do I know the nature of the myriad beginnings?
By this.

The preceding twenty-one chapters—
The previous chapter states, "I alone differ from others, for my virtue is great."
Thus follows "The bearing of great virtue," speaking of its vast embrace and all-encompassing nature.
What then is this "Dao as a thing"? What thing is it?
With images, with things, with essence—does it truly exist?
To call it existent, one lacks the eye of practiced insight;
To call it nonexistent, one equally lacks the eye of practiced insight.
How, after all, is it to be understood? Hmph!

**Verse:**
From ancient times, a single thing—
Yet none have known it.
Raise your brows, and bare bone appears in empty space.
Should you hesitate or deliberate,
A thunderclap splits the void.

Bent, it remains whole;
The unhewn tree endures.
Twisted, it straightens;
To yield is to extend.
Hollow, it fills—
*Wā*, deep as a gourd.
Humble, it gains.
Worn, it renews;
Obscured, it shines of itself.
Little, it attains;
To know cessation is lasting sufficiency.
Much, it confounds;
Affairs in excess breed chaos.

Thus the sage embraces the One as the model for all under Heaven.
The One governs the many.
Not self-displaying, thus luminous;
Worn, it renews.
Not self-asserting, thus distinguished;
Hollow, it fills.
Not self-boasting, thus meritorious;
Twisted, it straightens.
Not self-exalting, thus exalted.
Bent, it remains whole.
Only through non-contention,
Holding to softness,
Does none under Heaven contend with him.
Blended into oneness.

The ancient saying "Bent, it remains whole"—was this empty words?
It is true and real speech.
In perfect sincerity, return to it.
Preserve its original wholeness.

Chapter Twenty-Two
Bent yet whole, crooked yet straight,
Hollow yet full, worn yet renewed—
these continue the preceding chapter’s discourse on the virtue of the profound.
From "Not self-displaying" onward,
all warn against excess and exhort humility.
Humble and lowly, thus without contention;
without contention, one preserves one’s original wholeness,
embraces the primordial and guards the One,
returning to the boundless.
Hence it is said: "In perfect sincerity, return to it.
Preserve its original wholeness."

*Verse:*
Heed not the faults of others,
Nor boast of your own strengths.
Faults and strengths—no dual vision,
Nowhere can they be concealed.

"Few words accord with nature."
Speech lies not in the tongue.
"Whirlwinds do not last the morning,
Violence does not endure."
"Sudden rains do not last the day."
Impatience does not long prevail.
Who brings this about?
Who is the master?
Heaven and Earth—
all know this.
Yet even Heaven and Earth cannot last forever;
how much less can man?
Thus one who engages with the Dao
follows principle and aligns with the track.

Those who accord with the Dao are one with the Dao;
unity is seen as one.
Those who accord with virtue are one with virtue;
no single view arises.
Those who accord with loss are one with loss;
no distinctions exist.
Those who are one with the Dao,
the Dao delights in attaining them—
I am one with the Dao, the Dao is one with me.
Those who are one with virtue,
virtue delights in attaining them—
I am one with virtue, virtue is one with me.
Those who are one with loss,
loss delights in attaining them—
I am one with loss, loss is one with me.
"Trust is insufficient, thus disbelief arises."
I doubt things, things doubt me.

Chapter Twenty-Three
"Few words accord with nature"—
this continues the preceding chapter’s discourse on non-contention.
"Not self-displaying" means responding well without speaking.
"Whirlwinds and sudden rains"
are metaphors for reckless action and impetuous advance that do not last.
One who engages with the Dao
harmonizes with virtue and power,
blends with all things,
naturally resonates with them,
and things naturally respond in kind.
If one’s words do not accord with the Dao,
or one acts recklessly,
one cannot gain others’ trust,
but is instead slighted by them.
The *Book of Changes* says:
"Words and deeds are the hinge and spring of the noble one,
the master of honor and disgrace—
how can one not be cautious?"

*Verse:*
The Dao is not different from people,
People merely deem it so.
One Buddha is all Buddhas,
The mind is the ground of the Tathāgata.

"One who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm"—
impetuous advance yields no merit.
"One who strides cannot walk"—
haste does not bring success.
"One who self-displays is not luminous"—
cannot conceal one’s power.
"One who self-asserts is not distinguished"—
cannot humble oneself.
"One who self-boasts has no merit"—
cannot restrain oneself.
"One who self-exalts does not endure"—
cannot contain oneself.
In relation to the Dao, these are called
"leftover food and redundant conduct."
Redundant growths and excess.
Things may revile them—
all find them unlovely.
Thus one who possesses the Dao does not dwell in them.
The enlightened act otherwise.

Chapter Twenty-Four
This chapter collectively confirms the preceding three.
"One who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm,
One who strides cannot walk"—
this refers to "whirlwinds and sudden rains."
"Self-displaying, self-asserting,
self-exalting, self-boasting"—
all are private intentions.
Private intentions, once fixed, harm the public—
how can they endure?
Thus one who possesses the Dao does not dwell in them.
"Leftover food and redundant conduct" are unlovely.

*Verse:*
Standing on tiptoe is fundamentally delusion,
Striding is inherently madness.
Even if one succeeds in some affair,
In the end it is not as good as constancy.

There is a thing, chaotically formed—
this is Heaven’s undifferentiated state.
Born before Heaven—
this is Heaven’s transparent state.
Silent, empty, profoundly still—
it stands alone, unchanging,
transcendent and self-existent.
It revolves without end—
its transformations are inexhaustible.
It may be called the Mother of all under Heaven,
nurturing and sustaining all.
I do not know its name—
it is fundamentally nameless.
I style it "Dao"—
a name given in response to things.
Forcibly, I name it "Great."
Boundless.
"Great" means "passing away"—
without boundaries.
"Passing away" means "far-reaching"—
without limits.
"Far-reaching" means "returning"—
gathering and returning.
Thus the Dao is great,
the Great Void without form.
Heaven is great—
it models itself on the Dao.
Earth is great—
it models itself on Heaven.
The king is also great—
he models himself on Earth.
Within the realm, there are four greats—
is there yet another great?
The king occupies one of them—
alone he is honored in the Three Realms.
Man models himself on Earth—
nothing is not borne.
Earth models itself on Heaven—
nothing is not contained.
Heaven models itself on the Dao—
nothing is not encompassed.
The Dao models itself on nature.

Chapter Twenty-Five
This chapter follows the preceding, which states that "one who possesses the Dao does not dwell" in such things,
and here elucidates the work of dwelling in the Dao.
From "There is a thing, chaotically formed" onward,
the entire passage is the essential teaching of embodying the Dao.
From "Within the realm, there are four greats" onward,
all is wondrous and sublime.
People know only that within the realm there are four greats,
yet do not realize that this very self is even greater.

*Verse:*
Though Heaven and Earth are great,
They too decay and crumble.
Only this one thing
Endures through kalpas unchanged.
The sacred, unknowable one—
all abides in thusness, unmoving.

"Heaviness is the root of lightness,
Lightness is born of heaviness."
"Stillness is the ruler of restlessness"—
stillness governs movement.
Thus the noble one, though traveling all day,
does not part from the baggage train—
dares not act lightly.
Though there be splendid sights,
he dwells in serene detachment—
constantly responsive, constantly still.
How can the lord of ten thousand chariots
treat his person lightly in the world?
To bear the burden lightly.
Lightness loses ministers,
Impetuousness loses the ruler.
Seeking glory brings disgrace.

Chapter Twenty-Six
Heaviness must not be treated lightly.
"Lightness loses ministers,
Impetuousness loses the ruler"—
this is what is meant by "one who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm,
one who strides cannot walk,"
and is also a metaphor for "whirlwinds and sudden rains."
"Not parting from the baggage train" means
bearing the burden and carrying the load.
"Dwelling in serene detachment" means
turning things around.
This clarifies the preceding chapter’s discourse on modeling oneself on the Dao,
summarizes the two chapters on embodying the Dao,
and continues with the essential teaching of good conduct in the following chapter.

*Verse:*
Impetuous advance cannot endure,
Lightness cannot accomplish anything.

One whose heels never touch the ground
still treads the journey’s path.
The perfect traveler leaves no wheel tracks—
tracks form where heels press down.
The perfect speaker finds no fault in words—
words take shape where the tongue begins.
The perfect planner needs no counting rods—
one insight melts ten thousand things.
The perfect closure needs no bolt nor bar,
yet cannot be opened—
no seam or crack remains.
The perfect knot needs no cord nor tie,
yet cannot be undone—
no binding or constraint is left.

Thus the sage is ever skilled at saving others,
and so no one is cast aside—
cultivating the self to bring peace to the people.
Ever skilled at saving things,
and so nothing is cast aside—
adapting to the moment to benefit all.
This is called inheriting clarity—
clarity unbroken, continuous.

Therefore the good person
is the teacher of the ungood—
teaching others to be good.
The ungood person
is the resource of the good—
warning others to turn toward goodness.
If one does not value one’s teacher,
there is no goodness to be had.
If one does not cherish one’s resource,
there is no fault to be amended.
Though wise, this is great delusion—
casting aside wisdom like foolishness.
This is called the essential subtlety—
acting in accord with nature’s flow.

Chapter Twenty-Seven: Exhausting the Essence of the Preceding Chapters

In speech and action, be meticulous—then no trace remains, no blame accrues. The mind’s calculations cannot be reckoned; the mind’s closures cannot be opened; the mind’s knots cannot be untied. When the mind of Dao stands firm like this, there is no division between good and ungood. Teacher and resource are both forgotten; wisdom is set aside, and one remains all day like a fool.

**Verse:**
Steps need not depend on feet—
a skillful knot requires no thousand hands.
Touch the tip of your nose,
and the whole body becomes a mouth.
If you can thoroughly ponder this,
the forty-nine arise from the seven-sevens.

Know the masculine, yet guard the feminine—
do not exalt yourself.
Become the world’s stream,
where all tributaries return to the source.
Become the world’s stream,
and constant virtue never departs,
forged into one unbroken whole—
returning to the state of an infant,
where qi is complete.

Know the bright, yet guard the dark—
do not display yourself.
Become the world’s model,
where all dharmas return to the One.
Become the world’s model,
and constant virtue never errs,
its standard unwavering—
returning to the boundless,
where spirit is complete.

Know glory, yet guard disgrace—
do not prize yourself.
Become the world’s valley,
where all existence returns to emptiness.
Become the world’s valley,
and constant virtue is fulfilled,
profound and perfectly round—
returning to the uncarved block.
*(Pronounced "pǔ.")*
Where nature is complete.
When the uncarved block scatters, it becomes vessels,
applied to things.
The sage employs it
to establish officials and teach the people—
thus the great system remains uncut,
a teaching without words.

Chapter Twenty-Eight: Guarding the Feminine, the Dark, and Disgrace

Not seeing one’s own clarity connects to the preceding chapter’s "though wise, this is great delusion." The infant, the Great Ultimate, the uncarved block—these are the great roots of the world. Only by guarding the feminine and embracing the One can one return to the source. Govern a state with this, and without need for restraint, the people naturally become pure, and things naturally return to simplicity.

**Verse:**
Within white, the black is preserved;
within the masculine, the One Feminine is embraced.
Unbroken, the work continues—
even men can learn to nurture the infant.

Those who would seize the world and act upon it are mistaken.
I see they cannot but fail.
To wield power against bandits is fitting;
to become a bandit is not.
The world is a sacred vessel—
it cannot be acted upon.
Where action stirs, misfortune arises.
Those who act destroy it,
grasping what is not theirs, clinging to what is.
Those who seize lose it,
seeking advantage, only to fall into it.
All things bear form—
some lead, some follow;
some warm, some chill;
some strengthen, some weaken;
some uphold, some cast down.
Where this exists, that arises—
beware of following it.

Thus the sage eliminates extremes,
*(Pronounced "qù.")*
non-action.
Eliminates excess,
non-desire.
Eliminates extravagance,
non-attachment.

Chapter Twenty-Nine: Non-Action and the Perils of Force

Non-action means no trouble; action invites trouble. Those who seize lose; those who act fail—this is the warning against force. Strength and weakness, upholding and casting down, depend on one another like shadow following form. Where there is success, there is failure. Thus the sage eliminates greed, excess, and arrogance, deeply warning later generations.

**Verse:**
Leading and following, warming and chilling,
strengthening and weakening, upholding and casting down—
who is the master in their midst?
It is no one.
Dressing and eating are ordinary matters—
why trouble yourself with needless doubt?

Those who assist a ruler with the Dao do so through non-action.
Do not seek to strengthen the world with arms,
but defend it with compassion.
Such deeds swiftly return—
*(Pronounced "xuán.")*
good and evil alike bear fruit.
Where armies encamp,
thorns and brambles grow.
Where the mind’s troops arise,
the sacred ground lies barren.
After great armies pass,
years of famine follow.
Where demonic forces gallop,
essence and qi are depleted.

Thus the good accomplish their ends and stop—
*(Pronounced "yǐ.")*
where there is decisiveness, life arises.
They dare not seize strength,
but meet force with softness.
Accomplishing without boasting—
eliminating extremes.
Accomplishing without flaunting—
eliminating excess.
Accomplishing without arrogance—
eliminating extravagance.
Accomplishing only when unavoidable—
even in hardship, this is the way.
Thus they accomplish without forcing—
lowering the banner of the sword.

When things reach their prime, they age;
when arms grow strong, they do not prevail.
This is called "not-Dao"—
a mistake.
Those who depart from the Dao perish early,
forever losing the true Way.

Chapter Thirty: Assisting Rulers with the Dao

Continuing the preceding chapter’s elimination of excess and extravagance: those who assist rulers with the Dao do not exalt military might. Good and evil alike bear fruit—this warns those who govern states and families to guard the feminine, embrace the One, and be brave in their restraint. Even when unavoidable, they dare not seize strength, thus it is said: "The good accomplish their ends and stop."

**Verse:**
Do not let the three minds run wild—
let the will always lead the intent.
Suddenly, if forced into battle,
one arrow settles Mount Tian.

Fine weapons are inauspicious tools.
After great armies pass, years of famine follow.
Some may detest them—
*(Pronounced "wù.")*
where armies encamp, thorns and brambles grow.
Thus those who embody the Dao do not dwell there.
*(Pronounced "chǔ.")*
Where the mind’s troops do not arise.

The noble person at rest values the left,
embracing softness.
In war, they value the right,
embracing hardness.
Weapons are inauspicious tools,
used to suppress rebellion—
not the tools of the noble person,
who constantly governs.
Only when unavoidable are they used,
with tranquility as the highest aim,
defending with compassion.
Victory is not glorified—
to do so is to seek merit.
This is delighting in killing.
*(Pronounced "yuè.")*
Indulging in hardness and bravery.
Those who delight in killing
plant the seeds of misfortune—
they cannot prevail in the world,
for the Creator does not tolerate them.

Auspicious affairs value the left,
embracing life.
Inauspicious affairs value the right,
embracing death.
The deputy general stands on the left,
valuing softness.
The supreme general stands on the right,
valuing hardness.
This is to handle them with mourning rites—
inauspicious tools.
When many are killed,
it is unavoidable—
mourn them with sorrow and tears.
*(One says: compassion.)*
When victorious in battle,
handle it with mourning rites,
as if grieving for parents.

Chapter Thirty-One: Weapons as Inauspicious Tools

Not seeking to strengthen the world with arms, the text follows with "weapons are inauspicious tools," deeply warning the sage about this.

Beneath the myriad generations, lords of states who embrace non-action and purity bring about governance and transformation naturally, so that households and nations alike attain tranquility. Though they possess armor and weapons, they have no occasion to deploy them, forever free from the calamity of strife and contention.

In praise it is said:
Silent, the realm of pure mystery,
Limpid, nurturing the Great Harmony.
Inverted, the sword of samādhi is grasped,
Sequentially, the five skandha-demons are transformed.

The Dao is ever nameless, empty and self-so.
Though the Unhewn is minute to the point of imperceptibility,
none under Heaven dare make it a subject.
Supreme it is.
Should lords and kings be able to preserve it,
embracing the One,
the myriad things will of themselves become guests,
none failing to submit.

Heaven and Earth unite,
aided only by virtue,
to send down sweet dew—
the result of harmonious qi.
The people, without command, of themselves attain balance.
*(Command: read in the departing tone.)*
Naturally they achieve peace.
When first systems are established, names arise,
laws and institutions are set forth.
Once names exist,
likes and dislikes are shown.
Thus they will know where to halt.
*(This is to make them know prohibitions.)*
Knowing where to halt is how one avoids peril.
Knowing contentment is how one abides in constant joy.
The Dao’s presence in the world
comes to rest in utmost goodness,
as streams and valleys
come to rest in rivers and seas—
in lowliness.

Chapter Thirty-Two:
The preceding chapter states that “those with the Dao do not dwell [in contention],” and here it says, “The Dao is ever nameless; though the Unhewn is small, none under Heaven dare make it a subject.” This clarifies the essential dwelling of those with the Dao. The person of the Dao outwardly abides beneath the chariot, inwardly embraces the One Real, and the myriad things naturally transform. Heavenly principle is spontaneously so, merging with spiritual transformation—boundless.

In praise it is said:
Once you grasp the Unhewn without flaw,
you can freely release and gather.
Then the great chiliocosm
is held in the tip of a hair.

Knowing others is wisdom,
manifest outwardly.
Knowing oneself is clarity,
manifest inwardly.
Overcoming others requires strength,
courage in daring.
Overcoming oneself requires strength,
courage in not daring.
Knowing contentment is wealth—
even in poverty, one is joyful.
Those who persevere in action have resolve,
ever unassailable.
Those who do not lose their grasp endure,
their will and power grow ever firmer,
their life’s foundation ever more secure.
Those who “die yet do not perish” attain longevity.
*(Longevity: read in the rising tone.)*
The True One abides constantly.

Chapter Thirty-Three:
Knowing others and overcoming others pertain to the external.
Knowing oneself and overcoming oneself reside within.
This confirms the warning of the preceding three chapters against the use of arms.
Those who know contentment find joy even in poverty.
Those who persevere in action see all things accomplished.
Those who firmly hold their ground face no peril.
Those inwardly illuminated transcend life and death.
“Dying yet not perishing” means the True One abides constantly.

In praise it is said:
Seeing things yet not seeing nature,
knowing others yet not knowing oneself—
such unlearned sorts
still claim to have gained advantage.

The Great Dao overflows,
vast and all-encompassing.
It can be to the left or right,
without limit.
The myriad things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse;
where it passes, transformation occurs.
Its work is accomplished, yet it claims no possession—
what remains is spirit.
It nurtures and sustains the myriad things yet does not act as their lord,
forgetting its own origin.
Ever desireless, still and unmoving,
it may be called “small.”
*(A mustard seed contains Mount Sumeru.)*
The myriad things return to it, yet it does not act as their lord,
letting things follow their natural course.
It may be called “great.”
*(Mount Sumeru contains a mustard seed.)*
Thus the sage never regards himself as great,
*(Abiding within a mustard seed.)*
and so is able to accomplish greatness—
beyond measure.

Chapter Thirty-Four:
“The Great Dao overflows” means it is utterly vast, penetrating the most subtle, lacking nothing. “The myriad things rely on it to live yet it does not refuse” and what follows connect to the preceding chapter’s “those who do not lose their grasp endure.” Applied to governing the state, this means not losing one’s grasp; applied to self-cultivation, it means “dying yet not perishing.” Hence it is said, “It can be to the left or right.”

In praise it is said:
The Great Dao is truly hard to fathom,
empty space cannot be measured.
Vast and boundless, forming a single expanse—
where are its borders?

Grasping the Great Image,
*(Image: read in the rising tone.)*
though one looks, it cannot be seen—
all under Heaven come to it.

The myriad people submit.
They come without harm, and the myriad things flourish.
In peace and great tranquility,
the ten thousand transformations rest secure.

Music and delicacies—
*(Music: read as "yào.")*
both sound and flavor are exquisite.
They entice the passing traveler to stay.
Yet when the traveler passes, they cease.

The Dao that issues from the mouth
is bland, as if without flavor.
*(Issues: read in the falling tone.)*
Without sound, without scent,
gazing, one cannot see it—
the Great Image has no form.
Listening, one cannot hear it—
the Great Tone is soundless.
Its use cannot be exhausted.

The Dao is hidden, without name;
its use is inexhaustible.

Chapter Thirty-Five:
The closing line of the preceding chapter states, "Hence it can accomplish greatness," so this chapter follows with "Grasping the Great Image, all under Heaven come," meaning that preserving its formlessness draws the hearts of people and things to turn and submit. "Music and delicacies," where both sound and flavor are exquisite, lose this formlessness—how can they endure? The Dao that issues from the mouth is flavorless and formless, without sound or color. Because it has no fixed body, its responsiveness and use are inexhaustible.

In praise it is said:
A mud ox pants at the moon,
a wooden horse neighs in the wind.
Gazing, it seems to exist—
seeking, it has no trace.
The hermit’s staff at Clear Hermitage
sketches the wondrous peak of Miao Gao.
To gather it in?
One must first firmly open it—
firmly opening, it must then gather.

To weaken it, one must first firmly strengthen it—firmly strengthened, it must then weaken.
To abolish it, one must first firmly establish it—firmly established, it must then abolish.
To seize it, one must first firmly give it—firmly given, it must then seize.
This is called subtle illumination.
The slightest sign is the first omen.

The soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.
The soft and weak are ever harmonious; to employ hardness is to court defeat.
Fish cannot leave the depths—
how can man depart from the Dao?
A state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others.
Where there is advantage, there is harm.

This is the thirty-sixth chapter.
Grasping the Great Image, one perceives the subtlest signs of affairs.
No sooner does one see firm expansion than one knows coming contraction;
before the sprout appears, the omen is already known.
Who but the subtly illuminated of all under Heaven could attain this?

Those who study the Dao preserve its formlessness and guard its utmost softness.
They contend not with things, and thus naturally know the signs.
If one employs violence, exalts stratagems and cunning,
seeking to overcome things—this is not the Dao.
For example, fish belong in water;
to seek distinction among other fish and leave the depths—is this possible?
Since it is not, then neither should man exalt power.
To exalt power is to reverse the constant—like fish leaving the depths, they must perish.

A state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others—
this aligns with Confucius’ saying, “One may stand with them, but not weigh with them.”
Even when sages employ power, reversing the constant to accord with the Dao,
it must not be lightly done—how much less so for ordinary people?
Can one not be warned?

In praise it is said:
Eyes like shooting stars,
mechanism swift as lightning.
Gazing, it seems ahead—
suddenly, it is gone.
Within the openness and obstruction of the ten directions,
light pervades all without exception.

The Dao is ever non-action, yet nothing is left undone.
Still and unmoving, it responds and connects with all under Heaven.
Should lords and kings be able to guard it,
the myriad things will transform of themselves.
Above, they transform those below as wind.
When transformation stirs and desires arise,
I will quell them with the nameless uncarved block.

*Act* (pronounced in the entering tone).
Without desire on my part, the people naturally return to simplicity.
The nameless uncarved block also will have no desire.
I value stillness, and the people naturally rectify themselves.
Without desire, through stillness,
the wise are made not to dare act.
All under Heaven will naturally rectify itself.

Act through non-action—
then nothing will be left ungoverned.

This is the thirty-seventh chapter.
The true and constant Dao is fundamentally non-action;
action is not the constant Dao.
This connects to the previous chapter’s subtle illumination.
Heaven and Earth act not, yet the myriad things are born and completed.
The sage acts not, yet the myriad people are at peace.
In terms of self-cultivation:
without any contrivance, in moments of stillness preserve its formlessness.
At the slightest movement, one must first awaken—
once awakened, quell it with the nameless uncarved block.
The uncarved block has no form, and is also called nameless—meaning emptiness.
The Dao is non-action; the uncarved block is nameless; the heart is without desire—
then one naturally returns to stillness.
Stillness upon stillness—
all under Heaven will naturally rectify itself.

In praise it is said:
All action is illusion;
non-action, too, falls into emptiness.
Transcending both paths,
one unfolds the essence of the lineage.

The *Daoist Gatherings of the Meeting of Dao and Virtue*, Volume One, concludes here. #1 (This passage appears doubtful.)
The *Daoist Gatherings of the Meeting of Dao and Virtue*, Volume Two.
Recorded by Li Daochun Yuan-su of Clear Hermitage in Du Liang, the Firefly-toad Daoist.

The highest virtue does not act as virtue—
thus its virtue is all the greater.

The lesser virtue does not lose virtue—
thus it clings to its own virtue.
Therefore, it has no virtue,
and its virtue is ever more lost.

The highest virtue acts without acting and without contrivance,
still and unmoving,
yet responsive and perfectly attuned.
The lesser virtue acts with contrivance,
seeking resonance through virtue,
ever scheming and striving.

The highest benevolence acts without contrivance,
bestowing kindness upon all things,
yet fundamentally without action.
The highest righteousness acts with contrivance,
engaging with things through righteousness,
ever scheming and striving.
The highest propriety acts, yet none respond—
seeking to order all things through ritual,
yet never truly ordering them.
One thrusts forth an arm to pull them back,
but the more one pulls, the less they align.

Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises—close to the Dao.
When virtue is lost, benevolence arises—close to virtue.
When benevolence is lost, righteousness arises—close to benevolence.
When righteousness is lost, propriety arises—close to righteousness.
Yet propriety marks the thinning of sincerity,
the erosion of loyalty and trust,
the beginning of chaos.
It fails to order.
Foreknowledge is but the flower of the Dao,
seeking novelty without substance—
the beginning of folly,
the loss of the Dao.

Therefore, the great person dwells in depth, not in shallowness,
values substance and truth, not recognition.
Abides in reality, not in its blossoms,
upholds sincerity, not propriety.
Thus, one discards that and embraces this—
forsakes delusion to follow truth.

**Chapter Thirty-Eight**
The preceding chapter spoke of the Dao’s constant non-action,
so this follows with the highest virtue’s non-virtue.
The highest virtue acts without acting, thus aligning with the Dao.
The lesser virtue acts with contrivance, thus misaligning with the Dao.
Benevolence and righteousness remain close to virtue,
serving as steps toward the Dao.
Propriety, however, is rife with contrivance and lacks substance—
seeking to order all things through ritual,
yet things grow ever more disordered.
For all contrivance ultimately leads to loss.
Even clinging without loss may gradually lead to refinement,
returning from benevolence and righteousness to virtue,
from virtue to the Dao,
and thus attaining non-action.

Foreknowledge is but cleverness,
and cleverness marks the beginning of the Dao’s loss.
Thus it is called the flower of the Dao—
those who possess the Dao do not dwell in it.

In praise it is said:
Before transcending the Three Realms,
how can one escape the Five Constants?
The Five Constants dissolve into formlessness,
as one strides alone to meet the August Void.

Of old, those who attained the One—
attaining the One, all things were complete.
Heaven attained the One and became clear,
profoundly still and constant.
Earth attained the One and became tranquil,
silent and unmoving.
Spirits attained the One and became numinous,
merging into truth.
Valleys attained the One and became full,
abundant and overflowing.
The myriad things attained the One and came to life,
naturally flourishing.
Lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under Heaven,
serene and firmly established.
Their attainment was the One.

If Heaven lacked clarity, it would fear splitting—
the stars and constellations would lose their order.
If Earth lacked tranquility, it would fear erupting—
mountains and peaks would crumble.
If spirits lacked numinosity, they would fear fading—
yin and yang would lose their harmony.
If valleys lacked fullness, they would fear exhaustion—
blocked and impassable.
If the myriad things lacked life, they would fear extinction—
the harmonious qi would dissipate.
If lords and kings lacked integrity, their loftiness and nobility would fear collapse—
their states and families would face peril.

Thus, nobility takes humility as its root—this is the One.
Loftiness takes lowliness as its foundation—this is the One.
Lords and kings call themselves "orphaned," "widowed," and "destitute,"
ever embracing the One.
Is this not taking humility as their root?
The One is the master of the ten thousand images—
is it not so?
How could it be otherwise?

Thus, when counting carts, there is no single cart—*shu*, pronounced *suo*.
When counting *wo*, there is no *wo*.
One does not wish to be as polished as jade, or as cold as stone.
Noble and base are both forgotten.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine**
The previous chapter spoke of discarding that to take this—meaning to discard the superficial and take the root.
What is the root? The One.
The One is the beginning of Heaven and Earth, the mother of the myriad things, the application of the Great Dao.
If lords and kings could guard it, the myriad things would naturally return to it.
Calling oneself "orphaned," "widowed," and "destitute" is to remain humble and not forget the root.
Not wishing to be as polished as jade or as cold as stone, forgetting noble and base—only embracing the One.
The name "counting carts" has no single cart.
The name "counting *wo*" has no single *wo*.
When the axle and wheels unite, it is called a cart.
When the four elements unite, it is called *wo*.

The ode says:
Obtaining the One is not called wondrous,
Returning to emptiness is not yet the Mysterious.
Knowing a dream is a dream within dreaming,
Beyond Heaven, do not seek Heaven.

The reversal is the movement of the Dao—
When the numinous One emerges, it is drawn back.
The weak is the application of the Dao.
Focused *qi* achieves softness.

The myriad things arise from *you* (having).
*You* has a name—it is the mother of the myriad things.
*You* arises from *wu* (non-being).
*Wu* has no name—it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.

**Chapter Forty**
The reversal is the movement of the Dao—continuing the previous chapter’s teaching that nobility takes humility as its root.
The myriad things arise from *you*, *you* from *wu*—this is the teaching of counting carts without a cart.
Yet how many scholars do not grasp this principle truly.

Moreover, how does the Dao express the essence of *you* and *wu*?
Observe the ode:
Having form is not *you*,
Formless is not *wu*.
Neither *you* nor *wu* can stand alone—
Still, this is to fall into one-sidedness.
Only within the interplay of *you* and *wu* does one find the path—
Then one knows the Master’s hidden beard.

The superior person hears the Dao and diligently acts upon it;
The superior person resolves and unifies it all at once.

**Chapter Forty-One**
The middle scholar hears the Dao—sometimes as if it exists, sometimes as if it does not.
The mediocre and below hear much but believe little.
The lowly scholar hears the Dao and laughs at it.
Why do they not believe? Only because it is too clear.
If one does not laugh, it is not truly the Dao.
After great confusion, there must be great awakening.

Thus it is said:
At first hearing, the two fragments reveal the liver’s depths.
The Dao, though bright, is veiled in bloom—
Advancing in the Dao seems like retreat,
Looking forward and backward.
The Dao blends like harmony, like dust in the light.
Virtue’s height is like a valley—
Empty, it receives all.
Great whiteness seems like shame—
Lowly, it tends itself.
Broad virtue seems insufficient—
Full yet not overflowing.
Established virtue seems like theft—
*Thief*, pronounced *yú*, rhymes with *yú* (渝).
Sealed yet not exposed.
True substance, like *yú*, adapts without measure.
The greatest square has no corners—
No sharp angles revealed.
Great vessels mature late—
No claim to their own achievement.
Great sound is rare—
Strike it, and it responds.
Great form is shapeless.
Nothing is more hidden than what is concealed.
The Dao is hidden, nameless—
Nothing is more manifest than the subtle.

Only the Dao
Lends itself well and brings completion.
Loyalty and reciprocity—nothing more.

---

The previous chapter spoke of *you* and *wu* generating each other—
A teaching only the noble can doubt.
Thus, it follows with the superior scholar hearing the Dao.
The Dao, though veiled, though seeming retreat, though blending, though hidden like theft,
Cannot be seen—
Hence the reason for laughter upon hearing it.
Only the noble, with nature pure and empty,
Can transcend and enter directly—
Silent yet believed, effortless yet accomplished.

The mediocre and below cannot help but waver between doubt and belief;
The lowly and unworthy do not merely disbelieve—they laugh and scorn it.

*"Lends itself well and brings completion"* means:
Lending to the lowly’s laughter and scorn,
While completing the superior’s diligent practice.

Even the lowly and unworthy—
Once awakened at the start,
Can turn back to goodness.
Why should anyone be abandoned for their failings?

The ode says:
The supreme Dao is originally easy,
Yet human hearts claim it difficult.
The middle scholar still debates,
The lowly turns dull-witted.
No dull-witted star exists—
Weigh it, and the thing is on the scale.

The Dao generates One—
The void generates One *qi*.
One generates Two—
One *qi* divides into yin and yang.
Two generates Three—
Yin forms the Three Powers.
Three generates the myriad things.
The Three Powers generate myriad forms.
The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,
Taking form from Heaven, shape from Earth.
The harmonizing *qi* is the middle.
Examine the *qi* of middle harmony.

What people detest—
The solitary, the orphaned, the unpaired,
The cornerless—
Is what rulers prize.
They call themselves solitary and orphaned.
Thus, all things have form.
Sometimes, diminishing benefits,
The humble receive gain.
Sometimes, adding causes loss—
The full must overturn.
What people teach is always for goodness—
Yet it is also my righteous teaching.
I am also like this.

The mighty and overbearing shall not meet their end.
The strong and powerful are doomed to perish.
I shall take this as my guiding principle.

The unvirtuous become the foundation for the virtuous.

**Chapter Forty-Two:**
One is the mother of all things.
What people detest—this One without pair,
The solitary, the orphaned, the unpaired—
The great lords and nobles do not forget their roots,
And thus call themselves solitary and orphaned,
In humility and self-effacement.

Those who are humble and self-effacing shall surely receive benefit,
While the strong and powerful shall surely invite calamity.

The Sage establishes this teaching,
To warn people to restrain themselves and practice humility,
To see what is unvirtuous and inwardly reflect upon it.

**Ode:**
To love victory is to often meet adversity,
To practice humility is to long endure peace.
Gentleness and harmony are daily virtues,
In every place, the realm of kings and mountains.

The utmost softness in the world
Overcomes the utmost hardness in the world.
Softness can erode hardness.
There is nothing that cannot enter where there are no gaps.
Piercing metal, penetrating stone.

Thus, I know the benefit of *wuwei*.
Humility brings benefit.
Teaching without words,
Silent yet trusted.
The benefit of *wuwei* is achieved through *wuwei*.
Few in the world can attain this.
Those who understand harmony are rare.

**Chapter 43:**
The previous chapter spoke of the lonely and widowed who do not turn their wheels [of action], the utmost humility. Hence, it follows with the utmost softness.
It means that softness overcomes hardness, that loss contains benefit, and that loss upon loss reaches *wuwei* [non-action].
Without speaking, yet trustworthy; the benefit of *wuwei*, few in the world attain.
**Ode:**
When met with opposition, do not compete,
When matters pass, let the heart remain cool.
This very realm of coolness,
Where even the heavens and earth cannot conceal it.
Which is closer—name or body?
A high name brings dishonor to the body.
Which is more abundant—body or wealth?
Excess wealth brings harm to oneself.
Which is more harmful—gain or loss?
Gained favor invites dishonor.
Thus, the more one loves, the greater the expense,
The more one covets others’ possessions, the more one clings to them.
The more one hoards, the greater the loss.
Seeking advantage only brings misfortune.
Knowing sufficiency brings no dishonor; sufficiency stops greed.
Knowing restraint brings no peril; fearing restraint averts calamity.
Thus, one may endure long.
Knowing sufficiency is always sufficiency.

**Chapter 44:**
The previous chapter spoke of the benefit of *wuwei*, meaning that action brings loss.
Hence, it follows with: *Which is closer—name or body?*
Name, wealth, gain, and loss are all rooted in action; they cannot endure long.
Only knowing sufficiency and restraint can endure long.
**Ode:**
All things in the world are transient,
None can last eternally.
Tame the restless monkey-mind,
Listen to the lion’s roar.
If one can unleash the treasure within the family,
Then the spring blooms like birdsong in mountain flowers.
The greatest attainment seems incomplete,
Yet its use knows no exhaustion. (*弊* rhymes with *鳖*)
Not self-displaying, hence unbroken.
The greatest abundance seems to overflow,
Yet its use is inexhaustible.
Not self-satisfied, hence without end.
The greatest uprightness seems to bend,
Yet it does not flaunt.
The greatest skill seems clumsy,
Yet it does not rely on artifice.
The greatest discernment seems inarticulate,
Yet it shines without glare.
Agitation overcomes coldness—
The reckless burn.
Calm overcomes heat—
The tranquil cool.
Purity and stillness are the Dao of the world.
If people can abide in purity and stillness,
All under heaven will return to them.

**Chapter 45:**
The previous chapter spoke of purity and stillness as the Dao of the world, so it follows with: *The greatest attainment seems incomplete...*
Those with virtue in excess yet action in deficit live long,
Those with wealth in excess yet action in deficit are despised.
The greatest attainment seems incomplete,
The greatest abundance seems to overflow,
Even to the utmost bending, clumsiness, and inarticulateness—
All are virtue in excess yet action in deficit,
Their use is inexhaustible.
Thus, they are the Dao of the world.
**Ode:**
Human nature knows gathering and scattering,
The world’s ways have rise and decline.
Only the True Constant endures,
Unchanged from ancient to modern.
To transform the world there is a method:
Emotions follow nature.
To curb the warhorses with dung,
The mind-horse is idle, the spirit-sprout flourishes.
When the world lacks the Dao,
Nature follows emotions.
Warhorses are born in the suburbs.
The mind-horse rages, the heart’s ground is desolate.
No guilt is greater than craving,
The root of dishonor.
No calamity is greater than not knowing sufficiency,
The trap that ensnares the body.
No blame is greater than desiring gain,
The origin of self-destruction.
Thus, knowing sufficiency is always sufficiency.
The contented poor find joy in their lot.

**Chapter 46:**
The previous chapter spoke of purity and stillness as the Dao of the world, so it follows with: *The world’s ways have rise and decline...*
Not stepping outside yet knowing the world—
This speaks of the Daoist who knows the inner yet ignores the outer, continuing the previous chapter’s meaning.
To know the inner yet ignore the outer
Is to know nothing yet see nothing.
If one only knows the outer and sees the outer while forgetting the inner,
Then one’s knowledge and vision are shallow and narrow.
**Ode:**
Morning I wander the Southern Peak,
Evening I rest in the Azure Mound.
Swiftly a thousand miles,
Yet never have I strayed from it.
Tread iron shoes to no avail—
The sought is found without effort.
To study is to daily increase,
To practice the Dao is to daily decrease.
Decrease upon decrease,
All loss is exhausted.
Until reaching *wuwei* [non-action],
Where nothing more can be lost.
In *wuwei*, yet nothing is undone.
Nothing is unconquered.
To take the world, one must act with no affairs,
For affairs arise from the mind’s fixation.
When affairs arise, the mind’s fixation cannot be attained.
Thus, it is insufficient to take the world.
Action always has an end.

**Chapter 47:**
Not stepping outside yet knowing the world—
This is inner knowledge.
The farther one goes, the more distant,
Outer affairs.
Hence, it follows with: *To study is to daily increase...*
It means the unlearned seek only gain,
But those who practice the Dao decrease in all things.
The *Yijing* says: *Mountains below, marshes above—loss. The superior person restrains anger and checks desires.*
This is exactly so.
When even anger is extinguished and desire is lost,
Until reaching *wuwei* [non-action],
Then all under heaven is transformed and the world returns to order.
If one acts recklessly,
The people are disordered and difficult to govern.
Thus, it is insufficient to take the world.

**Chapter 49:**
The ode says:
*With learning, confusion grows at every turn,*
*Without action, all things fall into place.*
*When both learning and action are abandoned,*
*Loss and gain are left to others.*

Do not mock my humble, poverty-stricken appearance,
For from old it is said that thieves do not rob the poor.

The sage has no fixed mind,
No rigid method of action.
He takes the hearts of the people as his own.
He follows the Way’s spontaneous responses,
Adjusting to circumstances.

To the virtuous, I am virtuous;
I follow them and do virtuous deeds.
To the unvirtuous, I am also virtuous;
I guide them to return to virtue.
*Virtue’s power is complete*—
It fulfills their highest good.

To the faithful, I am faithful;
I follow them and do faithful deeds.
To the unfaithful, I am also faithful;
I guide them to return to faith.
*Faith’s power is complete*—
It fulfills their highest truth.

The sage moves through the world in reverence—
*惵惵* (*jùn-jùn*), trembling with care,
*兢兢业业* (*jìng-jìng yèyè*), diligent and unwavering—
Yet he blends the hearts of the people,
*浑* (*hún*), leveling them as one.
Different paths, the same end.
All the people turn their ears and eyes toward him;
His bearing is dignified, his deeds a model.
The sage nurtures them as children.
Under heaven, one great family.

The preceding chapter spoke of *wuwei* [non-action] taking the world,
So it follows with: *The sage has no fixed mind.*
By *no fixed mind*, it means
Following the Way’s spontaneous responses,
Never opposing the natural inclinations of the people.
Thus, the people obey the sage’s words,
Emulate the sage’s actions,
Follow the sage’s transformation,
And the world unites in one heart.

The ode says:
*To the faithful, I follow their faith,*
*To the virtuous, I follow their virtue.*
If one could truly understand this,
Yet still cling to inverted views—
*颠倒见* (*diāndào jiàn*, inverted perception)—
Then the Three Realms become one expanse,
And the ten directions merge into a single plane.
Emerging from birth, entering death,
Passing through the gates of anger and desire.

Those who live abandon anger and desire,
Yet thirteen in ten perish by water or fire.
Those who die indulge in anger and desire,
Yet thirteen in ten are spared by water or fire.
All life depends on water and fire.
To stir them toward death’s path,
Water and fire clash against them—
Also thirteen in ten.
*Water* completes its cycle in six,
*Fire* in seven.
Why so?
It is anger and desire that cause this.

「With its profound nurturing of life,
Anger and desire do not cease,
Greed for life is insatiable.
It is said that those who skillfully guard life
Have no anger or desire.

Traveling by land, they meet no tigers or rhinoceroses—
*兕* (*rì*, rhinoceros).
In self-reflection, they feel no guilt,
So what need for worry or fear?
Entering battle, they are not harmed by armor or weapons,
Their hearts unobstructed, so no dread exists.
The rhinoceros has no place to lodge its horn,
The tiger no place to set its claws,
Weapons no place to hold their blades.
If one does not cling to life,
How could there be death?
Why so?
The body is not mine to possess,
Death cannot harm me—
For I dwell in the realm of no-death.

Forgetting birth and death,
Thus the right fifty-first chapter:
The gentle and weak are those who guard life,
The strong and mighty are those who perish.
The gentle and weak can curb anger and desire,
While the strong and mighty are enslaved by them.
To curb anger, fire descends and is extinguished,
To restrain desire, water rises and is contained.
When water and fire are harmonized, life is sustained—
Hence they are called *those who guard life*.
Anger stirs the fire of ignorance,
Desire churns like ocean waves,
When water and fire clash, death ensues—
Hence they are called *those who perish*.
The strong and mighty greed for life without limit,
The gentle and weak regard death as returning home,
For they do not see death as death,
So what harm can tigers, rhinoceroses, armor, or weapons do to them?

In terms of the *Dan Dao* (Alchemical Dao),
When water and fire are harmonized, the *saintly embryo* (聖胎) congeals.
The ode says:
*Nirvana* (涅盘) is easy to grasp in the heart,
But discriminative wisdom is hard to discern.
Without discriminative wisdom,
How could there be death or life?
The *Dao* gives birth,
The *Yuan Shi* (元始) is the primal *qi* (祖气).
The *virtue/power* (德) nurtures it—
*Nurture* (畜), pronounced *xiù* (凶入声).
It transforms and gives birth to all the *Realms of Existence* (诸天).
It shapes all things—
In the heavens, it forms *images* (象).
By *effort* (势), it shapes forms on earth.
Thus all things, with their myriad forms,
Do not fail to honor the Dao and cherish virtue/power.
All arise from the Dao,
The Dao’s grandeur, virtue’s nobility—
Exceeding the ancients, surpassing the present.

None know their rank yet remain ever natural,
They do not speak of goodness in response.
Thus the Dao gives birth, nurtures, and preserves—
*Qi* (神) is complete.
It grows and fosters—
*Qi* (气) is complete.
It matures and perfects—
*Essence* (精) is complete.
It nourishes and shelters—
Form is complete.
Life is given yet not possessed,
Forgetting the *mechanisms* (机).
Action is taken yet not relied upon,
Forgetting the *affections* (情).
It grows yet is never slaughtered,
Forgetting all things—
This is called *mysterious virtue/power* (玄德),
In harmony with the Dao.

Thus the right fifty-first chapter:
Those who skillfully guard life
Know the realm of no-death,
Hence they follow with the words of *Dao-giving-birth*.
The Dao is formless,
Yet through giving birth to the heavens and earth, its form becomes visible.
The Dao is nameless,
Yet through fostering all things, its name can be established.
All things with their forms
Receive their mandate from the heavens,
Take shape from the earth,
Draw *qi* from the *Central Harmony* (中和),
All are the Dao’s manifestations—
Thus all things honor the Dao and cherish virtue/power.

The ode says:
*The Dao that can be spoken is not the true Dao*,
*The Way of non-action yet has action*.
I clearly explain it for you,
Yet all waters flow westward.
The night arrives, and the *chaos* (混沌) is plucked from the earth,
All forms and patterns remain unknown.
The world has a beginning,
Nameless—
The beginning of the heavens and earth.
They call it the *mother of the world*.
With a name—
The *mother of all things*.
Knowing its mother,
Knowing the root—
Knowing its root,
Its children reveal its end.
Knowing its children,
Knowing its future—
Returning to its mother,
Attaining the root—
The body remains unharmed,
Ever present.
Seal its *joy* (兑),
The inner realm does not escape.
Close its *gate* (门),
The outer realm does not enter.
A lifetime without exertion—
Not laboring yet governing.
Open its joy,
The inner realm emerges,
Accomplishing its affairs—
The outer realm enters.
A lifetime without salvation—
Forever losing the true Dao.

Seeing the small as *illumination* (明),
Knowing the subtle and minute (*few* and *microscopic*).
Guarding gentleness as *strength* (强).
Softness can erode hardness.
Using its *light* (光),
All things come and are illuminated.
Returning to its illumination, letting go and gathering—
No harm befalls the body.
*Letting go* (遗), pronounced *wèi* (音谓).
Beware of following others’ paths.
This is called *embracing constancy* (袭常).」

The Way gives birth—
This is the origin of the Way’s speech,
Thus it follows the beginning of all things beneath Heaven.

The final sentence is most urgent—
Those who cultivate the True Dao must turn here to the True Eye,
Lest they stray past it.

The ode proclaims:
*"Not gathering, not releasing,*
*The highest is attainable,*
*Pure and clear by nature,*
*The original form."*

Further inquiry: How is the First Principle?
All speech about the Way is slander.

Let me know—
Before action, there is awareness.
Walk the Great Dao:
Do nothing,
Yet fear only what is given.
Those who recognize the Law tremble.

The Great Dao is vast and level,
Smooth and straight,
Yet people prefer shortcuts.
*Good*—pronounced *xiào* (去声).
They take risks for luck.

When affairs are excessive, chaos follows.
*Chao*—pronounced *cháo* (音潮).
Fields lie barren, sacred lands abandoned.
Granaries are empty—
Sacred lands exhausted.
Wearing ornate robes—greed.
Wielding sharp blades—anger.
Disdaining food and drink—delusion.
Wealth in excess—desire never ceases.
This is called *robber’s pride*.

The Three Poisons stir unrest—
This is not the Way. Indeed, it is error.

The **Fifty-Third Chapter** (of the *Right* section) follows the previous chapter’s *"Climb the Constant"*—meaning the secret application of the Constant Dao—hence it continues with *"Let me know before action, there is awareness."*

With awareness, one can directly uphold and secretly apply it; without awareness, one cannot secretly apply it and acts recklessly. The mind is obscured by internal defilements and external karma and perception, compounded by ignorance, while the Three Poisons agitate—this is not the Dao, indeed it is error.

The verse praises:
*"Toying with cleverness ends in clumsiness,*
*Excessive troubles bring early decay.*
*Gold and jade fill the hall,*
*Yet how can they be kept always?*
If daily life is reversed in action,
All dust and sand of earth become treasure.*

*The well-built does not uproot,*
*Uproot—pronounced **bá** (音跋).*
*Roots deep.*
*The well-embraced does not fall,*
*Base firm.*
*Descendants’ sacrifices never cease,*
*Enduring.*

*Cultivate it in the self—self refined,*
*Its virtue becomes true;*
*Fully true.*
*Cultivate it in the family—family harmonized,*
*Its virtue overflows;*
*Abundant.*
*Cultivate it in the village—village refined,*
*Its virtue endures;*
*Long-lasting.*
*Cultivate it in the realm—realm governed,*
*Its virtue is profound;*
*Thick and rich.*
*Cultivate it in the world—world at peace,*
*Its virtue is universal.*
*The Dao flourishes.*

Thus, observe the self with the self—within, there is a single defilement, its virtue is not true.
Observe the family with the family—there is one discord, its virtue lacks abundance.
Observe the village with the village—there is one not transformed, its virtue does not endure.
Observe the realm with the realm—there is one not virtuous, its virtue is not profound.
Observe the world with the world—there is one petty man, its virtue is not universal.

How do I know the world is thus?
By this.
*Turn inward and examine oneself.*

**Chapter 54**

The preceding chapter states: *"Let me thus know with clarity—when knowledge arises, the Dao-heart is steadfast, unshaken in its holding, hence it follows."* For what is well-established cannot be uprooted.

With this, one cultivates the self, observes the heart, and examines nature—when the heart is settled, the self is refined.
With this, one governs the realm, observes the people, and examines oneself—when the people are transformed, the realm is governed.

If Heaven’s order has even one flaw, then it is because one’s own governance and transformation are flawed.
As the *Book of Documents* says: *"When the people err, it lies with one man."*
This is what is meant.

Reflecting inward, if the heart harbors even a speck of defilement or attachment, then it is because my innate nature has not yet been illuminated.

**Ode:**
To observe the realm is no simple task,
To observe the self—its meaning runs yet deeper.
When the sea dries, its depths are revealed,
But when a man dies, his heart remains unknown.

Rich in virtue, he withdraws into seclusion—
Like the infant.
Pure and undivided.
Venomous creatures do not sting him,
Fierce beasts do not seize him,
Raptors do not strike him.

(*Shì* [螫], pronounced *shì* [释]. *Jué* [攫] and *yǎn* [玃], both pronounced *jué* [厥缚切].)

「I lose myself in things, and things lose themselves in me.
My bones are frail, my sinews soft, yet my grasp is firm.
(*Sīn* [筋], pronounced *jīn* [斤].)
My spirit is whole.
I do not know the union of male and female yet *yīn* [绞] arises,
(*Yīn* [绞], even tone.)
My essence is whole—
the utmost of essence.
Natural and unrestrained.
I wail all day yet my voice does not grow hoarse—
even tone.
My *qi* is whole.
The utmost of harmony.
Knowing harmony, I call it constant—
this is the Dao’s undifferentiated unity.
Knowing constancy, I call it clarity—
this is the Dao’s boundless openness.

To nurture life is to invite misfortune;
to increase is to bring loss.
When the heart commands *qi*, it becomes strong.
When *qi* moves, it becomes rigid.
When things grow robust, they age;
when rigid, they easily break.
This is called *not the Dao*.
(*Cuò* [错].)
Not the Dao is already premature death.
To lose one’s innate truth.

**Chapter 55:**
The well-founded is unshaken—
the depth of virtue.
Thus, I follow it with the verse:
*"To hold the primordial face,
First preserve the infant’s heart.
This heart ever unobscured,
Reveals the golden body of dharma.
The wise do not speak,
Silence accomplishes all.
Speakers do not know—
The threefold mystery of the tongue.
Close the mouth of speech,
No words escape.
Shut the gate of sight,
No forms enter.
Blunt the sharpness of strife,
No contention.
Unravel the tangled,
No affairs.
Harmonize its radiance,
No self remains.
Merge with the dust of things,
No others exist.
This is called *Mysterious Unity*.
One thread runs through all.
Thus, it cannot be grasped as near,
Forgetting emotion.
It cannot be cast aside as distant;
Forgetting form.
It cannot be exploited for gain,
Forgetting things.
It cannot be harmed by schemes,
Forgetting craft.
It cannot be prized as noble,
Forgetting possession.
It cannot be scorned as base,
Forgetting absence.
Thus, it is most noble in the world.
All forgetting exhausted, only true constancy remains."*

**Chapter 56:**
To hold virtue’s depth is to remain silent,
Thus, I follow it with the verse:
*"The wise do not speak,
For there is nothing to be said.
Non-speech is the Dao itself.
This is precisely what is meant.

I say that many words bring gain,
But silence brings no harm.
Alas.
The verse goes:
Cutting off gain ends all harm,
No closeness means no distance.
Much speech invites loss,
Better to be like *Zhuīlú* [觜卢] in retreat.
With rectitude govern the realm—
no partiality, no favoritism.
With spontaneity wield the military—
no schemes, no stratagems.
With non-action take the world—
no doing, no grasping."*

**Chapter 57:**
How do I know this to be so?
By this:
Nature penetrates *li* [理] and melts with *róng* [融].
The world abounds with taboos and prohibitions,
Yet the people grow ever poorer.
The delusions of desire for gain.

The people hoard many tools of profit,
And the state becomes ever more corrupt.
The dazzle of rare commodities.

Men indulge in cunning arts,
And strange objects proliferate.
The shift toward superficial tricks.

Laws and decrees grow ever more explicit,
And thieves and robbers abound.
Law begets deceit from above.
Thus, the sage says:
*"I act without doing, yet the people transform themselves;
I do not prize schemes and stratagems.
I cherish stillness, yet the people align themselves;
I do not use tools of profit.
I act without affairs, yet the people grow wealthy;
I do not honor rare commodities.
I have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.*
Simplicity—*pǔ* [朴], pronounced *chú-bó* [蒲卜].
To govern with rectitude.

**Chapter 58:**
The previous chapter spoke of *non-speech by the wise*,
And thus attained its rectitude.
Hence, I follow with *governing with rectitude*.

Taboos abound, tools of profit abound,
Cunning arts abound, laws and decrees abound—
All these are not rectitude.
When the ruler has no taboos, the people thrive;
Cutting off schemes and stratagems, the people transform themselves;
Lightening taxes and levies, the people grow wealthy;
Guiding them with virtue, the people return to simplicity.
Acting without doing, without affairs,
Without desire, cherishing stillness—
All these are rectitude.
Govern with this, and the seas will be calm, the rivers clear;
Practice the Dao with this, and the Dao will flourish, the times prosper;
Cultivate oneself with this, and the *qi* will solidify, the spirit congeal.
One person rectified, ten thousand people rectified;
One heart rectified, ten thousand transformations rectified;
One self rectified, ten thousand affairs rectified.
Great is the power of rectitude!
The verse says:
*"Fixing one’s mind brings endless error,
Non-action again falls void.
Since the heart’s path is severed,
Every day is spring breeze.
His governance is tranquil and broad,
Tranquil as the gate’s closing.
Non-action brings ease and abundance.
His people are pure and sincere,
Simple and unadorned, with virtue overflowing.
His governance is keen and strict,
With action, stern and precise.
His people are hollow and greedy,
Hollow as *quē* [缺], pronounced *yà* [轧].
Avid and insatiable, their ruin is near.
Disaster, disaster!—
Fortune depends upon it.
Fear disaster, and fortune will surely come.
Fortune, fortune!—
Disaster lies hidden within.
Neglect fortune, and disaster will surely arise.
Who knows its limits?
Disaster and fortune have no gates—
Only people invite them by themselves.
Is it not rectitude that is lacking?
Only rectitude can be upheld.
Rectitude becomes strange,
Relying on rectitude makes it strange.
Goodness becomes demonic,
Pride in goodness makes it demonic.
The people’s confusion opposes the Dao,
And their error grows with time.
Their confusion becomes distant and never returns.
Thus, the sage is square yet does not cut,
Square in his rectitude, letting his heart transform itself.
Modest yet not defiled,
Pure in his virtue, letting the people transform themselves.
Upright yet not unrestrained,
Firm in his conduct, letting things transform themselves.
Bright yet not blinding,
Holding and nurturing his light, the world transforms itself.*

**Chapter 59:**
The previous chapter continued the meaning of *governing with tranquil breadth*.
In governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.
Speaking of the state, it means lightening punishments and levies, reducing taxes;
Speaking of the self, it means moderating speech and actions, regulating drink and food;
Speaking of the heart, it means lightening thought and worry, severing sight and hearing.
Exhausting one’s heart, nurturing one’s nature—
This is how one serves Heaven.
The verse says:
*"To live is to govern affairs, to govern affairs is to live;
To lighten affairs is to lighten living, to sever affairs is to sever life’s threads.
Clouds linger at the ridge’s peak, idle yet never fully clear,
Water flows through the ravine’s depths, ever too busy to rest.
To govern a great state, as to poach a small fish—
Disturb it, and it will fall apart.
With the Dao to rule the world, if one disturbs it, chaos follows.
Poach it, and it will spoil.
The ghosts are not numinous,
The yin-demons bow their heads.
Not that the ghosts are not numinous,
But that their numinosity does not harm people.
Evil does not intrude upon rectitude.
Not that their numinosity does not harm people,
For the sage also does not harm people.
Great measures do not cut.
When the two do not harm each other, form and spirit both attain perfection.
Thus, virtue returns to its source, and the Dao resonates in harmony."*

**Chapter 60:**
To govern with rectitude,
His governance is tranquil and broad,
In governing people and serving Heaven—
All these speak of governing a great state.
A small fish—*xiǎo xiān* [小鲜], the delicate, tiny fish.
Like poaching a small fish, disturbing it makes it spoil—
Saying that to govern the world in peace,
Disturbing it brings chaos.

To rectify one’s heart with non-action,
To nurture one’s nature with clarity and stillness,
To humble oneself in self-cultivation—
Then the people’s hearts will be content and obedient,
And the world will return to its source.

「To act without harming others,
The world achieves peace.
The fierce and violent have no means to wield their power,
And the spirits lose their fearsome nature.

As for transforming the violent into the virtuous,
Even those with great strength lack the intent to harm.
The sage does not impose punishment upon the petty,
And the ruler and ruled exchange virtue in harmony—
Hence, the two do not harm each other.

In cultivating oneself,
Clarity, purity, and non-action as the foundation,
Then passions and desires are severed,
And the hidden malevolence dissipates.
The body remains, and life endures;
The vital essence restores itself,
And the spirit is whole—
This is the Dao of eternal longevity and enduring vision.

**Ode:**
*From the source, success is seen—
Why twist and strain?*
*Once a spark ignites,
Even a speck in the eye is a burden.*
*A single stroke of insight,
A thousand years of striking the donkey’s stake.*
*The great state flows downward—
The highest virtue is like water.*
*Where the world converges,
Many lofty things attach to the low.*
*The world’s receptivity—
Many strong things cling to the yielding.*
*The yielding ever overcomes the rigid with stillness,
Stillness as the lord of agitation.*
*To be still is to be low—
All movement attaches to the still.*
*Thus, the great state yields to the small,
And takes the small;
The small serves the great,
And yields to the great.*
*Or the great yields to take the small—
The small must submit to the great.*
*Or the great yields and takes—
The small must be absorbed by the great.*
*The great state seeks only to embrace and nurture the people,*
*Nurturing, the harsh entering as sound.*
*The humble and lowly welcome the inferior,*
*The small state seeks only to submit and serve others,*
*The humble and obedient follow the superior.*
*The two—superior yielding, inferior obeying—
Each attains what it desires,*
Each fulfills its proper role.*
*Thus, the great ought to be low—
The high yields to the low as its base.*

**Chapter 63:**
To act with non-action,
To reveal the essence of all things.
Non-action encompasses all actions;
Affairs without affairs achieve all things;
Tastes without tastes are profound and enduring.
These three are the mysteries of the Dao.

The great arises from the small,
The many from the few,
Retaliation comes through virtue.
To plan for difficulty in the easy—
The easy is fragile and easily broken;
To build greatness from the minute—
The subtle is easily dispersed.
The world’s most difficult tasks begin with the easy,
From the subtle to the manifest;
The world’s greatest undertakings begin with the minute,
Accumulating small to great.

Thus, the sage never seeks to be great,
The sage does not claim sainthood.
Therefore, he accomplishes true greatness.
True sainthood lies with the people.

The sage finds difficulty in the easy,
And does not lightly reveal it.
Thus, he never faces true difficulty.
What is gained with difficulty is lost with difficulty.

**Chapter 62:**
Non-action reveals the Dao’s essence—
The mysteries of all things.

To act with non-action,
To manage affairs without interference—
Tastes without indulgence,
Its flavor is subtle and lasting.
These three are the Dao’s mysteries.

The great emerges from the small,
The many from the few,
Retaliation comes through virtue.
To plan for difficulty in the easy—
The easy is fragile and easily broken;
To build greatness from the minute—
The subtle is easily dispersed.
The sage’s achievements are vast,
Yet he does not claim greatness.

Heaven does not claim to be heaven—
What makes heaven is the myriad things;
The sage does not claim to be sage—
What makes the sage is the people.
Because he does not claim sainthood,
He attains true sainthood.
To be great must begin with the small,
To ascend must begin with the low—
Difficult tasks are easily accomplished,
Easy tasks are difficult to complete.

**Chapter 61:**
Continuing the *Jìzhǐ* chapter’s meaning of virtue’s exchange.
The lowly, like water’s descent,
Draws all waters to itself.
The yielding overcomes the rigid,
Stillness overcomes movement.
The sage humbles himself in self-cultivation,
Remains tranquil in response to things—
Then the world transforms and attains perfection.
The superior yields to the inferior below,
The inferior yields and follows the superior above,
Superior yielding, inferior obeying—
Virtue’s exchange returns to its source.

In cultivating oneself,
The more one lowers the heart, the higher the Dao ascends,
The more one retreats, the greater virtue advances,
Humility and reverence bring radiance,
Lowliness cannot be surpassed—
Thus it is said: *The great ought to be low.*»

**Ode:**
*Busy all day, rushing about—
Turn back, and you’re home.*
*Once enlightened, there’s nothing to do,*
*No chaos to entangle like hemp.*
*To practice non-action,*
*To conceal the spirit within the spirit,*
*To manage affairs without interference,*
*To conceal the heart within the heart,*
*To savor without indulgence,*
*To conceal the form within the form.*
*Great or small, much or little,*
*Act in reverse, oppose the natural order.*
*Repay resentment with virtue—*
*Not fixed in others.*
*Plan for difficulty in the easy—*
*The easy is fragile and easily broken,*
*To build greatness from the minute—*
*The subtle is easily dispersed.*
*The world’s most difficult tasks begin with the easy,*
*From the subtle to the manifest,*
*The world’s greatest undertakings begin with the minute,*
*Accumulating small to great.*
*Thus, the sage never seeks to be great,*
*The sage does not claim sainthood.*
*Therefore, he accomplishes true greatness.*
*True sainthood lies with the people.*
*Light promises must be few in trust—*
*Gained easily, lost easily.*
*Many easy things bring many difficulties,*
*Light and easy things are hard to complete.*
*Thus, the sage regards even the easy as difficult,*
*And does not lightly reveal it.*
*Thus, he never faces true difficulty.*
*What is gained with difficulty is lost with difficulty.*

The easy is not lightly shown,
For lightly shown, men neglect it—
Thus the sage regards it as difficult.

What is gained with difficulty is lost with difficulty,
And only what is not lightly taken will endure without trial.

*Ode:*
To speak of ease is not ease,
To speak of difficulty is not difficulty.
Within its subtlety lies its marvel—
The North Star gazing southward.

What is secure is easily held.
*Ease, with falling tone.*
*As below.*

Reside in ease yet fear danger.
What is yet unseen is easily planned—
Act, and plan at the beginning.
What is fragile is easily broken—
Plan difficulty from ease.
What is subtle is easily dispersed—
Plan greatness from the minute.
Act before it exists,
Prevent disaster before it arises.
Order before chaos,
Order before existence.

A tree in arms’ embrace grows from a hair’s end—
From the subtle to the manifest.
A nine-tiered tower rises from a clod of earth—
Accumulating small to great.
A thousand-li journey begins beneath one’s feet—
From near to far.

The doer undoes it—
Vigilance lies in the beginning.
The grasper loses it—
Vigilance ensures no loss.

Thus the sage, with no action, meets no defeat,
With no grasping, meets no loss.
Holding fast yet never abandoning—
Therefore, when the people act,
They have something to apply.
Yet often near completion, they fail,
Not vigilant at the start—
How then can there be an end?

To treat the end as the beginning,
Then no task shall fail.
The original heart unclouded—
How then can there be failure?

Thus the sage desires not to desire,
Desires that others not desire.
Does not prize hard-won goods—
Transforming things.
Teaches those who do not learn,
Correcting the errors of the many—
Shifting virtue.
Aids the natural unfolding of all things,
Yet dares not act.
The wise fear the law.

*Chapter Sixty-Four*
Continuing the meaning above:
What is secure is easily held—
Speaking of planning at the start,
Cultivated minds correct the heart before thought,
Restrain emotion before encountering things,
Then the heart is easily rectified,
Emotion easily severed.

If governance comes after chaos,
If disaster is warded off after its sprouting—
Is this not difficult?
Accumulating small to great—
Once lost, it cannot be reclaimed.
Thus the *Yijing* warns: *Tread on frost, expect solid ice.*
The *Commentary* says:
*A minister kills his lord, a son kills his father—*
Not the work of a single morning or evening,
But a gradual descent,
From failing to discern early enough.
The *Strike* says:
*Evil not accumulated cannot destroy life.*
Again it says:
*Evil accumulated cannot be undone.*
How can one not be warned?

If one awakens only after deviation,
And with earnest effort returns—
Still, it is not as good as resolving before form takes shape,
Without labor, restored.
Thus it is said:
*The subtle is easily dispersed,*
*The unseen is easily planned.*

Again it says:
*The doer undoes,*
*The grasper loses.*
The warning is yet more urgent.

The sage teaches those who do not learn,
Desires that others not desire,
With no grasping, no action,
Consistent from beginning to end,
Forever without peril.

If one attains this understanding,
Vigilant at the start—
How then can there be failure or loss?

Before a thing sprouts,
All signs appear—
Know it, and do not act;
Act, and do not lose.

Only the Precious Nine—
Exhausting this Way—
Could it be only Yanzi?

*Ode:*
*A hair’s deviation, a thousand-li’s loss.*
Rush back swiftly, yet still second.
Pressing the horse late to rein,
The boat at the river’s heart, mending too late.

The ancient skilled ruler
Did not enlighten the people—
Not knowing, not knowing.
He would deceive them.
His governance was dim.
The people are hard to govern,
For their cleverness is too much.
His governance was sharp.
To rule with cleverness is the state’s ruin;
To guide with cleverness leaves the people insufficient.
Not to rule with cleverness is the state’s blessing;
To guide with virtue leaves the people with abundance.
These two are the standards.
*Standard, pronounced as "kǎi" (口骇切).*
Widely inclusive, yet lawful—no people.
Always knowing the standard,
Abandoning the short for the long.
This is called *Mysterious Virtue.*
In accord with the Way.
Mysterious Virtue is profound and distant,
The more one explores, the deeper it grows,
The more one seeks, the farther it stretches.
It reverses with things,
Not consorting with all laws.
Only then does it reach the Great Harmony.
Going counter, yet aligning with transformation.

*Chapter Sixty-Five*
What is secure is easily held—
The swift return to goodness.
Thus the next best ruler
Does not enlighten the people.
Speaking of no-action’s breadth,
Peacefully governing the world—
The people’s blessing.
With action’s strictness,
Dominating the people—
The state’s ruin.
The people are hard to govern,
For they are too involved in affairs.
Thus the sage governs with no-action’s clarity and stillness,
So that the wise dare not act.
Though contrary to things,
Long accustomed to nature,
The people thrive, reaping a hundredfold blessings,
The world harmonized, achieving Great Harmony’s transformation.
Exhausting this Way—
This is called *Mysterious Virtue.*

*Ode:*
All conditioned things,
Three thousand six hundred gates.
Examined from the start,
All are but distractions of the spirit.
Only I embrace the nameless Primordial,
Endless demons bow in surrender.
The sea and rivers rule all valleys
Because they are lowly.
With their skill in descending,
Great states flow downward—
Thus they rule all valleys.
Different paths, same return.
Therefore the sage, desiring to lead the people,
Speaks to them in humility.
Desiring to precede the people,
He places himself behind.
Self-mastery.
Thus the sage, though above, does not burden the people—
The people forget their labor.
Though before them, he does not harm the people—
The people forget their deaths.
Thus the world willingly follows without tiring.
*Follow, pronounced as "lè" (音洛).*
With virtue, hearts are truly served.
Because he does not contend—
Humility and yielding—
Thus none under heaven can contend with him.
The world is at peace.

*Chapter Sixty-Six*
The skilled ruler humbles himself to tend his own nature,
Thus next, likening himself to the sea ruling all valleys—
The meaning of *Supreme Goodness as Water.*
Speaking to the people in humility,
The people forget their labor;

「With the body yielding to the people,
The people forget their deaths—
All through the resonance of *Dao* and virtue.

The true cultivator, humbling himself to tend his nature,
Thus refines his own being.

*Ode:*
Supreme Goodness as Water,
Benefiting all without end.
Piercing gold, traversing stone,
Silently flowing past obstacles.
With intent, he holds the moon for a thousand miles—
Without intent, he sends the traveler on the wind’s sail.

The world all says my *Dao* is vast,
All things push to honor me.
Seeming unworthy.
When faced, I conceal it.

Only the great has no equal—
Thus seeming unworthy.
Seeming what?
If worthy for long, it is trifling.
Once comparable, it is not great.

I possess three treasures, worthless in exchange:
Guard them carefully:
First, *cì*—compassion, benevolence.
Second, *jiǎn*—frugality, moderation.
Third, not daring to lead the world—
Humility, withdrawal.

*Cì* makes one courageous—
Nothing is unconquered.
*Jiǎn* makes one expansive—
Nothing is lacking.
Not daring to lead the world,
Thus one fulfills his role as vessel and leader—
None resist.

Now abandoning *cì* and courage—
It is harshness and violence.
Abandoning *jiǎn* and expansiveness—
It is greed and desire.
Abandoning withdrawal for precedence—
It is tyranny and force.
Death.
The followers of death.

*Cì* is *rén*—
In war, it conquers; the armies of the benevolent cannot be matched.
In defense, it is steadfast.
Benevolence guards.
Heaven aids those it would save,
With virtue as its support.
With *cì* as its shield.
The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is *shēng*—life;
The sage upholds his station with *rén*—benevolence.

*Chapter Sixty-Seven*
The lower the body, the higher the virtue—
Thus the sea rules all valleys.
The sage follows this,
So the world all honors him as great.
Unworthy words have no equal—
Again, humble speech.
Compassionate, forbearing, humble, withdrawn,
Frugal, modest, lowly—
Thus seeming unworthy.

The common crowd all extols vastness, force, and the violent courage of blood and *qi*—
Yet they do not know that compassion, forbearance, humility, and withdrawal encompass the greatest vastness.

The single character *cì*—
In war, it conquers;
In defense, it is unshaken.
The benevolent have no rival—
True courage.

*Ode:*
Do not drink the water of ignorance,
Cease generating distinctions.
Dispersed clouds clear the azure sky—
Ten thousand *li* of equal heaven.

The skilled warrior is not martial—
Compassionate, forbearing.
The skilled fighter does not rage—
Rage, pronounced as *nú* (音弩), rhymes with *wǔ* (武).
Soft and yielding.
The skilled victor does not contend—
Humility, yielding.
The skilled user of men is lowly—
Modest, deferential.
This is called the virtue of non-contention—
Supreme humility.
This is called using others’ strength—
Supreme softness.
This is called aligning with Heaven—
Supreme compassion.
The ancient perfect harmony with the *Dao*.

*Chapter Sixty-Eight*
Not martial, not enraged, not contending—
Expanding the meaning of *unworthy*.
The virtue of non-contention,
Using others’ strength—
All are expressions of *cì*—compassion,
Thus called *aligning with Heaven*.
Practicing this for self-cultivation,
Then life is preserved and longevity attained.

*Ode:*
Neither literary nor martial,
Neither gain nor loss.
Touching one’s nose,
Sweat pours from the body.
Plainly beneath the eyes—
Yet separated by mountains in discussion.

There is a saying about warfare:
I do not dare be host but am guest—
Compassionate, forbearing.
I do not dare advance an inch but retreat a *chǐ*—
Humility, withdrawal.
This is called *no-action*—
No-action, pronounced as *háng* (下音杭).
Not martial.
No arms—
No arms, pronounced as *rǎng* (如羊切).
Not enraged.
Yet unconquered—
Not contending.
No weapons—
Lowly.
No greater calamity than underestimating the enemy,
Daring courage leads to slaughter.
Underestimating the enemy nearly loses my treasures.
Strong and tyrannical are the followers of death.
Thus when armies clash,
The first to engage is victorious.
The benevolent’s armies—
Unmatched under Heaven.

*Chapter Sixty-Nine*
Continuing the meaning of *not martial* from the last chapter.
From *no-action* to *compassion triumphs*—
All are expressions of non-rage and non-contention.

*Ode:*
Loving victory ends in defeat,
Only compassion guards what is achieved.
No need for blades to wield,
The world celebrates peace.

My words are easy to know—
Compassion and forbearance alone.
Easy to practice—
Frugality and moderation alone.
Yet none under Heaven can know—
Faith is insufficient.
None can practice—
Strength is insufficient.

Words have their root—
Speaking reveals the *Dao*.
Deeds have their master—
Actions display the *Dao*.
Only the ignorant remain blind—
Thus they do not know me.
Seeing is unclear.
Few know me—
Who is the true connoisseur?
Those who follow me are precious—
Who dares to bear the responsibility?
Thus the sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade.
Internally treasuring *Dao* and virtue,
Externally acting lowly and humble.

*Chapter Seventy*
The previous chapter spoke of *compassion triumphs*—
Thus followed by *easy to know, easy to practice*.
Yet the world cannot know or practice—
Faith is insufficient.
Asking those who believe,
Yet they cannot act—
Strength is insufficient.
Thus the sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade,
Concealing brilliance within.

*Ode:*
The Supreme *Dao* is not difficult to know,
Yet human hearts cling to delusion.
A hundred tangled knots dissolve—
Suddenly reaching Caoqi.
Autumn moon, spring flowers—boundless meaning,
Only you know its depth.

Knowing the unknown—
True knowing.
Unknown yet knowing—
Illness.
False knowing.
Only the sick fear knowing—
Thus the unsick have no false knowing.
The sage is unsick,
Knowing yet seeming unknowing.
Because he fears false knowing,
He forgets what he knows.
Thus unsick—
Knowing all without knowing.

*Chapter Seventy-One*
*Knowing the unknown* above—
Continuing from the last chapter’s *easy to know*.
The sage knows all yet does not claim to know—
True knowing.
The world knows nothing yet claims to know—
False knowing, thus *illness*.
If one knows false knowing as illness
And fears that illness,
Then the illness of false knowing is cured.
The sage remains unsick
Because he fears his excess of knowing—
Thus he is unsick.

**Chapter Seventy-Two**

*Ode:*
He who flaunts his black beard’s redness,
Who boasts of hollowed lips in Daoist chanting—
If one can truly grasp this,
Then enlightenment awaits not a donkey’s lifetime.

The people fear not the awe of virtue,
Nor restraint—
Then great calamity descends.
One reaps what one sows.
To dwell without constraint,
To indulge in unrestrained desires—
To crave life without moderation.
*Ulian*, level tone.
Life’s excess is boundless.
Only he who does not crave
Errs in excess.
Thus, he who does not crave
Errs in excess.
Hence, the sage reverses this:
Knowing himself yet not displaying,
He does not indulge his passions.
Loving himself yet not esteeming,
He does not overvalue his life.
Thus, he discards that and takes this.
*Qu*, pronounced *Jianglü* cut.

*The people fear not the awe of virtue* above—
Continuing from the last chapter’s *unknowing the knowing as illness*,
*unknowing as knowing*—
Thus they lack restraint.
Hence follows the *Ode: The people fear not the awe of virtue*.
Common folk do not fear great virtue,
Dwelling without constraint,
Craving life without moderation,
Still seeking breadth and excess in life.
Not knowing moderation brings ruin—
Thus it is said, *great calamity descends*.
Those of the Dao reverse this.

*Ode:*
Bitter gourd’s root is bitter to the core,
Sweet melon’s rind is sweet through to the stem.
Pitiful are those who cling to desire—
They know flavor yet not moderation.
Boldness in daring leads to slaughter,
The overbearing are doomed to die.
Boldness in not daring brings life,
The yielding are kin to vitality.
Knowing these two,
Some profit, some harm—
Life and death intertwined.
What Heaven abhors,
*Wu*, pronounced *Wülü* cut,
The Creator does not endure.
Who knows its reason?
Knowing, one does not dare.
Thus the sage finds it hard.
He does not lightly reveal.
Heaven’s Dao:
Without strife, yet triumphs,
Without contention, yet prevails.
Unspoken yet answers well,
Great sound is faint—
Harmony brings response.
Unsummoned yet comes,
Silent and motionless—
Stirred, it flows.
*Shànrán* yet well-plotted.
*Shàn*, pronounced *Zhàn*.
Following nature’s course,
It conquers all.
Heaven’s net vast and sweeping,
Encompassing all without exclusion.
Though sparse, it misses none.
Though wide and open,
No thing can escape.

**Chapter Seventy-Three (Continuing from the previous chapter):**
The people do not fear authority,
For the world does not fear the law,
Daring to revel in boldness—
The root of self-destruction.

Boldness in not daring brings life,
Boldness in daring is but the vigor of blood and breath—
Boldness in not daring is the courage of virtue and principle.

**Ode:**
Daring to be bold, ever light in death,
A stubborn ox fears no whip.
Observe the reckless and base—
How many times their nostrils are pierced.

The people do not fear death,
Unrestrained, they chase illusions.
How can one deter them with fear of death?
It is like embracing firewood to quench flames.

If the people were made to fear death,
And those who act strangely were punished,
By appealing to their own desires—
I would seize and execute them,
Not letting any escape.
Who would dare?
Who would dare to defy?

Those who habitually wield the sword,
Heaven does not tolerate deceit.
He who substitutes for the executioner,
Is not the proper one to wield the blade.
This is called *dài dàjiǎo zhǔo*—
A carpenter’s apprentice wielding the adze.
The work does not concern him.

He who substitutes for the master carpenter,
Is like a gatekeeper wielding the axe—
Few escape unharmed.
He invites his own ruin.

「Chapter 74 (Continuing the theme of daring to defy death from the previous chapter):
The people do not fear death—
This is because the governance and moral cultivation of the ruler are not good,
And the people have lost their sustenance.

When the people lose their sustenance,
They seek to fulfill their lives,
And thus do not fear death.

Moreover, if the ruler adds harsh punishments and prohibitions,
Forcing the people to fear death,
Then this is driving the people to their own doom.

Exhausting the law leaves no people—
This is what Heaven abhors,
And thus the Sage does not tolerate it either.

*"Constantly there are those who wield the blade"*—
This means Heaven cannot be deceived.

*"He who substitutes for the executioner"*—
This refers to those who hold the authority of punishment.

*"A carpenter’s apprentice wielding the adze"*—
This is improper.

*"Few escape unharmed"*—
This speaks of the extreme of punishment,
Which harms the harmony of the people.

The Sage warns against this and cautions against excessive punishment.

**Ode:**
The void is silent, yet walls have ears.

Ask how to act, and strike the chest immediately.

The Great Earth’s order is just—
A long sword leaning on Heaven chills men to the bone.

The people’s hunger comes from scarcity and famine—
Because their ruler’s taxes and exactions are too heavy,
Greed leads to famine, and excessive desires bring chaos.
Thus, they hunger, and it is always insufficient.

The people’s difficulty in governance comes from disorder and confusion—
Because their ruler’s actions are too contrived,
Excessive affairs lead to chaos.
Thus, they are hard to govern, and it is always unstable.

The people’s disregard for death comes from forgetting their fate—
Because their pursuit of life is excessive,
Greed knows no bounds.
Thus, they dare to defy death,
Unmindful of peril and ruin.

Only he who does not cling to life,
Who does not indulge in it,
Is wiser than those who prize life.
He does not cling to life himself,
And thus attains lasting life.

**Chapter 75 (Continuing the theme of the people not fearing death):**
The people’s hunger, their difficulty in governance,
Arises from improper governance and moral cultivation—
The people do not fulfill their lives,
And thus cling to life while unmindful of peril and ruin.

Govern them with the law and they will rebel;
Govern them with virtue and they will submit.
If the ruler cherishes tranquility,
The people will find joy and follow his transformation.

**Ode:**
Wisdom is but filth,
Cunning is but dust.
Detach even the slightest thought,
And the nature of the boundless sea clarifies itself.

The people’s life is soft and weak—
A single mass of harmonious *qi*.
Their death is hard and strong—
The harmonious *qi* disperses.
All things, grasses, and trees in their life are soft and tender,
With harmonious *qi* intact.
In their death, they wither and dry—
The harmonious *qi* is gone.
Thus, the hard and strong are those who die,
For rigidity and violence are the roots of self-destruction.
The soft and weak are those who live,
For gentleness and harmony are the keys to nurturing life.
Therefore, strong arms do not conquer,
Relying on strength leads to defeat.
Strong wood bends,
And strong wood snaps.
Strength in excess brings ruin—
The root of sinking low.
Weakness in moderation brings elevation—
The symbol of rising high.

**Chapter 76 (Continuing the theme):**
When the ruler’s governance and moral cultivation are not good,
And harm the harmonious *qi*,
Then the world is filled with rigidity and violence.

By practicing non-action in purity and simplicity,
And refining oneself,
One can restore the harmonious *qi*—
The people fulfill their lives,
Find joy in their work,
And without testing punishments, all are content and obedient.
How could there still be rigidity and violence?

Thus, cultivating order and governing peace
All depend on gentleness and harmony.

Speaking in terms of the Daoist *elixir* (丹道),
When harmonious *qi* remains,
Water and fire support each other;
When harmonious *qi* disperses,
Water and fire oppose each other—
Thus, weakness in moderation is elevated.

**Ode:**
Softness and weakness are not good,
Hardness and strength are not evil.
Better to nurture the Great Harmony,
And dwell in perpetual ease and joy.

Is not Heaven’s Dao like drawing a bow?
Balancing and applying force to things.
The high are lowered,
The low are raised.
The abundant are diminished,
The lacking are supplemented.
The many are reduced,
The few are increased.

Heaven’s Dao diminishes the abundant to supplement the lacking,
And takes from the full to give to the modest.
But man’s Dao is the opposite—
He takes from the lacking to serve the abundant,
And harms others to benefit himself.
Who can give their abundance to serve the world?
Who can harm themselves to benefit others?
Only the Daoist can.

The Sage acts without relying on it,
And diminishes.
The Sage accomplishes without taking credit,
And diminishes.
He does not wish to be seen as virtuous—
*"Seen"* (見) pronounced *xiàn*.
Diminish even the diminished.

**Chapter 77** *(Continuing the theme of strength and weakness from the previous chapter—benefiting the deficient, harming the excessive: the Great Dao)*

The strong and mighty must be diminished,
The weak and feeble must be benefited.
Only the Daoist aligns with Heaven’s Way,
Diminishing desire to nurture true nature,
Reducing excess to supplement deficiency,
Sacrificing self to benefit others,
Taking from the abundant to give to the lacking—
Diminishing again and again,
Until arriving at *wuwei* (non-action).

*Ode:*
To benefit the ever-deficient—
Diminish, and abundance returns.
Only this heart of self-mastery
Is the equalizing scale.

None are softer or weaker than water—
The highest virtue resembles water.
Yet none can conquer the firm and strong—
A blow cannot split it.
Nothing can replace it.
No comparison exists.

The soft overcomes the hard,
The yielding prevails.
The weak overcomes the strong,
The pliable erodes the rigid.
All know this,
Yet none can practice it—
The burden is too great.

Thus the Sage says:
*Listen closely.*
To bear a nation’s impurities,
One may become its sovereign—
The sea embraces all rivers.
To bear a nation’s misfortunes,
One may become ruler of the world.
To dwell where others abhor,
To speak truth as if reversed—
To oppose the world’s ways.

**Chapter 78** *(Continuing the theme of diminishing and benefiting)*

None are as low or weak as water,
Yet it breaches dams and carves cliffs—
None can resist it.
Thus it is clear:
The soft overcomes the hard,
The weak overcomes the strong.
All know this, yet none can practice it—
Why?
Because they refuse humility.

What others abhor—impurity and misfortune—
Only the Daoist can bear.

*Ode:*
The weak submit to weakness,
The strong submit to strength.
Abandon discriminating thoughts,
Recognize the King of the Law.
Observe only the boundless, endless water—
Wherever it flows, round or square.
To reconcile great grudges
Only breeds more grudges;
Kindness repaid with resentment—
How can this be called good?
*Error.*

**Chapter 79** *(Continuing the theme of yielding and strength)*

The Sage holds the left contract—
*Contract*, pronounced *qiè* (挈).
Below, same pronunciation.
*Leaf*, pronounced *chè* (彻).
Sincerity and trust extend to all things,
Demanding nothing in return.
Mastering oneself,
Thus possessing virtue to govern the contract—
Nature serene, emotions at ease.
Lacking virtue to govern *leaf*—
Mind agitated, spirit exhausted.

Heaven’s Dao is impartial, utterly just,
Ever aligning with the Sage.
Only the Way is followed.

---

**Chapter 80** *(Continuing the theme of yielding and strength)*

To reconcile grudges with kindness
Dissolves the grudge, yet the heart remains.
How can this be called good?
Better to blame oneself,
Forgiving both grudge and kindness—
Then the people’s hearts naturally respond with trust.

The virtuous govern the contract,
The lesser-virtued govern *leaf*.
*Leaf* is clarity—
Only knowing clarity as decisive judgment,
Yet failing to see that exhausting the law leaves no people.
How can this be called good?
Those who govern the contract uphold sincerity,
Binding with the people’s hearts.

*Ode:*
Decisive judgment harms harmonious *qi*,
Kindness invites misfortune.
Better to govern the left contract,
Forgiving both grudge and kindness.

In small states with few people,
No greed—
Though possessing tenfold or hundredfold tools, they do not use them.
No reverence for the worthy—
Let the people hold death dear,
Yet not wander far.
Content with their lot—
Though there are boats and chariots, they ride none;
No movement.
Though there are arms, they are not displayed;
No strife.
Let the people return to knotted cords for record,
Reverting to simplicity.
Delight in their food, forgetting taste.
Admire their garments, forgetting form.
Find comfort in their dwellings, forgetting motion.
Take joy in their customs—
*Joy*, pronounced *luò* (洛).
Forgetting sorrow.
Neighboring states face each other,
*Face*, level tone.
No regard for external sights.
The sounds of chickens and dogs are heard,
Yet external sights do not enter,
Internal thoughts do not exit.
The people live until old age,
Their entire lives in the Dao.
No mutual visits.
Forgotten are *this* and *that*.

---

**Chapter 81** *(The final chapter, summarizing the eighty preceding chapters)*

The Sage does not accumulate,
Neither adding nor subtracting.
The more he gives to others, the more he possesses.
The more he bestows, the more he has.
Boundless salvation.

Heaven’s Dao is ever-generating,
Benefiting without harm,
Benefiting all without exception.
The Sage’s Dao follows Heaven’s course,
Acting without strife,
Compassionate, patient, frugal, and restrained.

---
**Ode:**
True words lack beauty,
Harsh truths are unpalatable.
Beautiful words lack truth.
*Mouth* threefold *dhyāna*—
The good do not argue,
No discriminating thoughts.
Those who argue are not good,
Giving rise to distinctions.
True knowing is not extensive,
Every head is complete.
The extensive do not know things,
Each obstructing the other.
The Sage does not hoard,
Neither increasing nor decreasing.
Having given to others, he is ever more useful.
Having given to others, he is ever more abundant.

Heaven’s great virtue is *shēng* (生),
Thus benefiting without harm.
The Sage’s virtue follows Heaven,
Guarding his place as *rén* (仁),
Thus acting without strife.

This final chapter exhausts the meaning of the eighty preceding.

The Classic says:
*The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao,*
*The name that can be named is not the eternal Name.*
Silent teaching, benefit through non-action,
Rare words naturally arise,
Flavorless and insipid,
Advancing the Dao seems like retreat,
Illuminating the Dao seems like obscurity,
Extensive virtue seems insufficient;
Great whiteness seems like disgrace.
*Xī* (希) and *yí* (夷),
Vague and indistinct,
Great sound is rare,
Great vessels mature late,
Right speech seems reversed—
Though these words may not please the ear,
Within them lies truth, hence:
*"True words lack beauty."*

*The Dao that can be spoken, the Name that can be named,*
Visible and audible—
Filled to excess, measured to sharpness,
Gold and jade fill the hall,
Doing good is called good,
Beauty is called beautiful,
Music and bait—
Sound and flavor both delightful—
Though pleasing to the ear,
They are ultimately unreal, hence:
*"Beautiful words lack truth."*

If stammering, if clumsy,
If foolish, if crude,
If bent, if dim,
Not revering one’s own worth,
Not valuing rare goods,
Dignified as a guest,
Sincere as the uncarved block,
Vast as a valley,
Muddled as turbid water,
Knowing white yet guarding black,
Knowing honor yet guarding disgrace,
Not seeing oneself, not affirming oneself,
Not boasting, not praising oneself—
All these are the goodness of non-argument.

Revering the strange, coveting wealth,
Exalting oneself, magnifying oneself,
Seeing oneself, affirming oneself,
Boasting, praising oneself,
Bold and daring,
Greedy in desire,
Fearless of authority,
Fearless of death,
Never satisfied,
Never stopping,
Forcing knowledge of what is ahead,
Bright and discerning—
All these are the evil of argument.

Not stepping outside,
Yet knowing the world,
Not peering through windows,
Yet seeing the Dao,
Sealing the senses,
Closing the gates,
Dulling the sharp,
Untangling the tangled,
Harmonizing the bright,
Blending with the dust—
Without speech, yet trusted,
Without sight, yet named,
Without action, yet accomplished—
All these are the meaning of *"true knowing is not extensive."*

The knowing of things and people,
The knowing of affairs and the outer world,
Without confining one’s dwelling,
Without exhausting one’s life—
Opening the senses,
Aiding in affairs,
Discarding frugality for generosity,
Discarding what comes later for what comes first,
Claiming knowledge while knowing nothing—
All these are the folly of the overlearned.

Acting yet not clinging,
Leading yet not ruling,
Accomplishing yet not dwelling upon it,
Abandoning the sage’s wisdom,
Abandoning benevolence and righteousness,
Abandoning cleverness and profit,
Minimizing self and desire,
Embracing simplicity and returning to the uncarved,
Diminishing again and again,
Until reaching non-action,
Avoiding excess, extravagance, and excessiveness,
Without knowledge, without affairs, without desire—
All these are the meaning of *"non-accumulation."*

As for bending to preserve, distorting to straighten,
Hollowing to fill, wearing out to renew,
All things returning to it,
All people transforming through it,
Heaven and Earth uniting with it,
Widely bestowing and aiding,
Never exhausted, never depleted,
Never failing, never laboring,
Its use never ceasing—
This is the meaning of *"the more one gives to others, the more one has."*

The Dao of Heaven generates, forms, circulates, and transforms,
Balancing and applying to all things,
Nurturing and storing them,
Growing and fostering them,
Completing and ripening them,
Nourishing and sheltering them,
Benefiting all without harm,
Utterly impartial, without selfishness,
Aided only by virtue,
Responding to goodness without being summoned,
Coming naturally when called upon,
Lowering the high, raising the low,
Reducing the excessive, supplementing the deficient—
All sentient beings are encompassed without exception.
This is benefit without harm.

The Sage’s Way:
Holding to the receptive, embracing unity,
Dwelling in softness, practicing humility,
Blending light with dust,
Putting others before oneself,
Aligning with the Dao,
Aligning with virtue,
Aligning with loss,
Square yet not rigid,
Straight yet not domineering,
Bright yet not dazzling,
Not demanding of others,
Lending generously and completing the task,
Rewarding the good and also benefiting the unworthy,
In small states with few people,
Content with sufficiency,
Returning the people to simplicity,
Forgetting distinctions of self and other,
So that people die of old age without traveling far—
All these are the meaning of *"non-contention."*

Only these two characters—*"non-contention"*—
Are the essence of eighty chapters.

If one truly believes this,
And applies *"non-contention"* in daily life,
With prolonged practice and refinement,
One will naturally attain the realm of the Primordial Oneness,
And the eternal Dao will be fully realized.

Thus, the Sage before the Emperor
Already grasped the original clarity and subtlety.

Now, how does *"non-contention"* function?
Ah, lay down the profit-seeking pole at the gate.

Ode:
Contention is always wrong,
Yielding brings abundance.
Without contention, merit is unbroken,
All transformations return to it.
