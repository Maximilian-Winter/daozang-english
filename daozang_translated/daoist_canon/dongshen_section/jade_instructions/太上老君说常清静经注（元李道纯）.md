**The Supreme Lord Lao’s Annotated Scripture on Constant Clarity and Stillness (Part I)**
*Annotated by Li Daochun of Qing’an, Lay Disciple of Duliang*

The Lord Lao said:
The Great Dao is formless, yet it gives birth to Heaven and Earth;
The Great Dao is without emotion, yet it moves the sun and moon;
The Great Dao is nameless, yet it nurtures the myriad things.
I know not its name, so I forcefully call it the *Dao*.
Yet the moment one speaks of what can be called *Dao*, it is no longer the eternal Dao.
If it cannot be spoken, how then can it be named *Dao*?
Ah! This single word *Dao* has already expressed it.

It cannot be seen when looked upon,
cannot be heard when listened to,
cannot be grasped when seized,
cannot be exhausted when used.
Vague and indistinct,
it does not belong to the realm of sound and perception.
Rare and subtle,
it has no fixed form.
If one treats it as sound and perception, comprehension will not suffice to grasp it;
if one seeks a fixed form, inquiry will not suffice to respond to change.

Though the Dao is formless,
through the birth of Heaven and Earth, its form becomes visible;
though the Dao is without emotion,
through the movement of the sun and moon, its nature can be discerned;
though the Dao is nameless,
through the nurturing of the myriad things, its name can be established.

The *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* states:
*"In Heaven, it forms images; on Earth, it takes shape—thus transformation is manifest."*
Is this not the form of the Dao?
It further says:
*"It drums them with thunder and lightning, moistens them with wind and rain. The sun and moon revolve, alternating cold and heat."*
Is this not the nature of the Dao?
It also says:
*"The Dao of Qian becomes male; the Dao of Kun becomes female."*
Is this not the name of the Dao?

The Dao is originally nameless, yet the sages forcibly named it *Dao* to encompass the myriad changes of the world, to unify its diverse paths—this is what is meant by the broad, level, and straight great Way.
The Dao possesses clarity and turbidity, movement and stillness.
Heaven is clear, Earth is turbid;
Heaven moves, Earth is still.
Male is clear, female is turbid;
male moves, female is still.
Descending from root to branch, it gives birth to the myriad things.
Clarity is the source of turbidity; movement is the foundation of stillness.
If one can constantly abide in clarity and stillness, Heaven and Earth will all return to it.

Before the Primordial Chaos divided, the principle of movement and stillness already existed;
once clarity and turbidity were distinguished, the mechanism of movement and stillness began to operate.
That which ascends in clarity is called Heaven; that which descends in turbidity is called Earth.
Heaven and Earth—one opening, one closing—one yin, one yang, mutually moving and mutually still, their mechanism ceaseless, thus the four seasons are formed, and the hundred things are born.
Among the natures of Heaven and Earth, man is the most noble; among things, man is the most spiritually endowed.
Man models himself on Heaven, woman on Earth;
man is clear, woman turbid—this is the ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth;
man moves, woman is still—this is the opening and closing of Heaven and Earth.
The intermingling of Heaven and Earth gives birth to the transformation of the myriad things.
Descending from root to branch, generation after generation, transformation after transformation, without cease.

The Supreme Lord first speaks of the formless, the emotionless, the nameless—the beginning of Heaven and Earth—then speaks of movement and stillness, calling it the mother of the named myriad things.
If there is one who knows that these two emerge from the same source but bear different names, then they will understand that clarity and turbidity are fundamentally one, that movement and stillness are not two.
Though the stream may be turbid, its source remains ever clear;
though its function may be active, its essence remains ever still.
Through long abiding in clarity and stillness, spirit and Dao become one, merging with Heaven and Earth.

Man’s spirit favors clarity, yet the heart disturbs it;
man’s heart favors stillness, yet desires drag it away.
If one can constantly dispel desires, the heart will naturally become still;
if one can settle the heart, the spirit will naturally become clear.
Thus the six desires will not arise, and the three poisons will dissipate.
The man of Dao constantly uses the Dao to restrain desires, not desires to restrain the Dao.
By using the Dao to restrain desires, the spirit becomes clear, the heart becomes still.
The supreme Dao and the spirit-qi intermingle, pervading the Three Powers and the myriad things, responding to change without end—vast in expanse, yet penetrating the most subtle.

If one uses desires to restrain the Dao, one loses the Dao.
The man who loses the Dao—once the heart of desire sprouts, there is nothing it will not reach.
Externally, power and profit entangle him; internally, thoughts and anxieties torment him.
The heart is turned by things, the spirit is enslaved by the heart.
Once heart and spirit are no longer clear and still, where then is the Dao?

If one can constantly restrain desires, the returning heart will not move;
if the returning heart does not move, it will naturally become limpid and profound, free from the slightest obscurity, returning to the great original clarity and stillness—what desires could there be?
The *Commentary on the Book of Changes* states:
*"Below the mountain is the marsh—Diminishing. The noble man restrains anger and curbs desires."*
Does this not refer to this?

The reason one cannot do so is that the heart is not yet settled and desires are not yet dispelled.
For one who can dispel them:
Internally observe the heart—there is no heart;
externally observe the form—there is no form;
distantly observe things—there are no things.
Once these three are awakened to, only emptiness is seen.

The Supreme Lord said:
*"Clarity and stillness are the norm of the world."*
What is meant by "norm"? It is the utmost impartiality, without selfishness.
Only the utmost impartiality of Heavenly principle can overcome the utmost selfishness of human desire.
The reason worldly people cannot attain the Dao is not that they are incapable, but that they are deluded by the desires of things.
To cut off desire, one must first forget self and others.
To forget self and others is to internally forget the heart, externally forget the form, and distantly forget things.
Once these three are forgotten, Heavenly principle is fully restored—this is called "greatness," which is the meaning of *Gen* (Stillness).

The *Book of Changes* states:
*"Stillness in the back—one does not obtain one’s body. Walking in the courtyard—one does not see others. No blame."*
*"Stillness in the back"* is to internally observe the heart—there is no heart.
*"One does not obtain one’s body"* is to externally observe the form—there is no form.
*"Walking in the courtyard—one does not see others"* is to distantly observe things—there are no things.

"‘No blame’ is the absence of desire. As the *Most High* states, *'No fault is greater than desire'*—this is its meaning. When the desires of things are seen as empty, the celestial purity of stillness is restored. To observe emptiness as empty—emptiness has nothing to be empty. What is to be emptied being none, even ‘non-emptiness’ is none. ‘Non-emptiness’ being none, profound clarity abides in constant quiescence. Quiescence having nothing to be quiescent, how can desire arise? Desire not arising, this is true stillness. Truly constant in responding to things, truly constant in attaining nature. Constant in response, constant in stillness—constant in purity and stillness. Though the myriad affairs seem not empty, when unified by the One, they ultimately return to the primordial thing. This is the essential method for dispelling desire. By means of emptiness, desire is dispelled; desire not arising, harmony with emptiness is also none. Emptiness being none, even ‘non-emptiness’ is none. ‘Non-emptiness’ being none, profound clarity abides in quiescence. Quiescence being none, this is called true stillness.

That which is profoundly clear and constantly quiescent is the congealing of spirit into emptiness and stillness. That which is quiescent yet has nothing to be quiescent is the merging of spirit beyond emptiness and stillness. The so-called true stillness is not non-movement. If stillness were taken as non-movement, it would have a fixed form. Having a fixed form, it would be insufficient to respond to change. Thus, to be truly constant in responding to things and truly constant in attaining nature is to move in response to things while the true essence remains unmoved. Those who see thus abide constantly in response, constantly in stillness, constantly in purity and stillness. Such purity and stillness gradually enter the true Dao. Having entered the true Dao, it is called ‘attaining the Dao.’ Though called ‘attaining the Dao,’ in reality there is nothing attained. For the sake of transforming sentient beings, it is called ‘attaining the Dao.’ Those who awaken to this may transmit the sagely Dao.

Quiescent and unmoving as its essence, responsive and unimpeded in its function—this is called true stillness. As for essence and function arising from one source, the manifest and the subtle without separation, the Dao of true constancy is attained. The word ‘attained’ is but a forced designation. If one claims there is something truly attained, it is insufficient to be called the Dao. The sage only fears that the world does not understand the principle of mutual arising of being and non-being, falling into the erroneous views of permanence or annihilation. Thus, by speaking of ‘attaining the Dao,’ he accommodates and completes them, allowing gradual accumulation to culminate in sudden realization. As for silently accomplishing it, being trusted without words—the sagely Dao may be achieved.

The so-called transmission is a transmission of non-transmission. The sagely Dao is sagely yet unknowable in its essence. As Lord Lao said: *'The superior person does not contend; the inferior person loves to contend. The highest virtue does not act virtuous; the lesser virtue clings to virtue.'* Those who cling are not called virtuous or of the Dao. Following the Confucian texts’ teaching of non-contention and practicing the Buddhist sutras’ conduct of non-contention—this single method emerges from no-method, penetrating insight merging in darkness—this is the superior person. The inferior person is not thus: the inferior person’s heart loves to prevail, constantly self-satisfied and self-displaying, thus self-aggrandizing and provoking contention. Even with the slightest good, he clings to it as his own virtue; I must call it non-existent. The superior person is the opposite: the superior person obscures his virtue with humility, nurtures himself without self-display, thus refraining from self-aggrandizement. Only by not contending does none in the world contend with him. What the *Most High* calls *'the highest virtue does not act virtuous, therefore it has virtue'*—this is its meaning. Those who cling, even to virtue, do not yet understand it; how can they understand the Dao?

Sentient beings do not attain the true Dao because they have deluded minds. Having deluded minds, they startle their spirit. Spirit startled, they cling to the myriad things. Clinging to the myriad things, they generate craving. Generating craving, they become afflicted. Affliction and delusion, anxiety and suffering of body and mind—thus they encounter defilement and disgrace, drift in the cycle of birth and death, constantly sink in the sea of suffering, and forever lose the true Dao. The inferior person loves to contend and cling to virtue because he has a deluded mind—this is the reason. As the ancients said: *'Constantly extinguish the deluded mind, do not extinguish the illuminating mind.'* All minds that do not cease are deluded minds; all minds that do not move are illuminating minds. When deluded thoughts first sprout, right and wrong divide; when the pivot is first set in motion, honor and disgrace are determined. Can one not be diligent?

If the deluded mind does not cease, it gives rise to all kinds of karmic conditions, leading to treading defiled paths, encountering calamities, and falling into dark destinies—none of which does not begin with the deluded mind. Those who study the Dao must be vigilant at the outset; if the beginning is not cautious, how can there be an end? When deluded thoughts first sprout, one does not self-awaken; spirit is enslaved by the heart, the heart is pulled by things, the Three Corpses rage fiercely, the Six Desires clamor and disturb—how can one not cling to things? Clinging to things gives rise to craving. Craving arising, affliction follows; deluded thoughts and various conditions intertwine without release, leading to anxiety and suffering of body and mind, encountering defilement and disgrace, drifting in the cycle of birth and death, constantly sinking in the sea of suffering, forever losing the true Dao. How lamentable! Thus, the deluded mind is the root of cyclic existence. Sentient beings do not attain the true Dao because the deluded mind is not extinguished—this is the reason.

The Dao of true constancy is attained by those who awaken. Those who awaken to the Dao abide in constant purity and stillness. Seeing this body, it too arises from deluded thoughts. The body born, then come emotional conditions; emotional conditions arising, then come anxiety and suffering. Deluded conditions proliferate, directly entering the cycle of rebirth—without beginning before, without end after—this is the case for all in the world. Only those who awaken to the Dao maintain the illuminating mind, seeing through the various conditioned appearances as all delusion and illusion, not allowing them to taint or cling. The illuminating mind existing, the deluded mind cannot act. With long and thorough practice, one next stabilizes and verifies the pure body. Those who see thus attain the Dao of true constancy.

The so-called illuminating mind is the celestial mind; true constancy is non-delusion. Understanding this mind, the mind of delusion is restored, and the Dao of non-delusion is accomplished. Non-delusion is thus the next restoration."

The *Book of Changes* states: "In returning, one perceives the heart-mind of Heaven and Earth." At this stage, even the most minute and subtle things are all illuminated beforehand. As for the state of suchness, unmoving—ever clear, ever knowing—utterly awakened, utterly numinous, perpetually pure, perpetually still: the Dao of true constancy is here fully realized, and the sagely task is complete.

In the *Laozi’s Scripture on Constant Purity and Stillness* (Annotation #1, "Responding to Things with True Constancy"), Du Guangting, Hou Shanyuan, Liu Tongche, and other commentaries concur, while the unannotated text reads "Responding to Things with True Stillness."
