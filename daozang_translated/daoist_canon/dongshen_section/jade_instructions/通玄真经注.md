**Preface to the *Tongxuan Zhenjing***

The great Dao has languished for ages untold. Yet its faint ripples endure, for among the various masters, none fail to trace their lineage to the Dao and virtue, mending the ruptures of a hundred generations.

Wenzi was a man of the time of King Ping of Zhou. He composed a work in twelve fascicles. The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: "Wenzi is also called Jiran, the teacher of Fan Li. His surname was Xin, given name Yan, styled Wenzi, a native of Pu in Caiqiu. A descendant of the Duke of Jin, he twice journeyed abroad, and Fan Li followed and served him. He was also a disciple of Laozi."

King Ping asked Wenzi: "I have heard that you received the Dao from the Old Master. Though a worthy possesses the Dao, if he lives in an age of debauchery and chaos, relying on the authority of one man to transform a people long steeped in disorder—can this truly be done?"

Wenzi replied: "When the Dao and virtue correct the perverse to govern, and restore order from chaos, reviving sagely virtue so that all under Heaven is at peace, the key lies in one man. Thus, the accumulation of virtue brings kingship, while the accumulation of resentment leads to ruin. By this, Yao and Shun flourished, while Jie and Zhou perished."

King Ping trusted his words and employed him, and in that time, all under Heaven was well-governed. Yet whether a state stands secure or falls, its fate does not descend from Heaven—it rests solely on whether the ruler employs the worthy.

Thus, the sage, ever vigilant for the world, cherishes its people as an infant, seeking to bring benefit, remove harm, and secure their peace—not for any private gain. His work first recounts the signs of rise and fall among the sage-kings and hegemons, then traces the causes of the waxing and waning of the Dao, virtue, propriety, and righteousness. In all, it ascends to the profoundest mysteries and extends to the myriad things. Its purport is vast and abstruse, its language refined yet true. Therefore, for those who govern a state, even in an age of decadence and decline, it can return them to the simplicity of primordial purity. For those who cultivate themselves, even burdened by the weight of cares, it can restore them to the spontaneity of their inherent nature. How great indeed!

The gentleman cannot but carve out his heart to receive it.

In the eleventh generation of our Tang, the Emperor, with robes flowing and transformation spreading, harmonizes and nurtures all things, embracing the myriad states with gentle grace, uniting diverse customs under one rule. Thus, those in high office all exhaust their loyalty and devotion, while those dwelling in obscurity also find peace in their labors.

In the fourth year of the Yuanhe reign, I, Moxi, withdrew to the distant slopes of Mount Heng, where I built my hut before the Hua Gai peak. Eight years have since passed, during which I have diligently cultivated the winds of simplicity and unobtrusively savored the subtle purport of the Way. Though I remain unfit for silent reverence, I have nonetheless forced myself to compose this commentary—an endeavor as daunting as measuring the vastness of the Milky Way or gauging the depths of the boundless sea. Thus, I offer this preface.

*Commentary by Master Moxi*

**The Origin of the Dao**

Of all things esteemed, none surpasses man.
Yet failing to settle the mind’s restlessness and illuminate its clarity, or to sever the net of attachment at the crossroads of desire, man’s nature drifts with craving, his life dissolving into the flux of things—much to the sorrow of the perfected.
Thus, the origin of the Great Dao is set forth here at the head of these chapters, that one may trace the source to ascend the Way and, in every encounter, touch the real. How could this not be fitting?

Laozi said:
There is a thing, chaotically complete, profoundly still and ever-abiding—hence it is called “a thing.”
It shapes and nurtures the ten thousand kinds, hence it is called “chaotically complete.”
Born before heaven and earth, it stands foremost among all things.
Its image is formless, like the heavens’ height bearing great signs, while the Dao’s vastness knows no fixed shape.
It congeals in emptiness as the One, and as qi disperses, it unfolds into the ten thousand things.

Abysmally dark, profoundly still, utterly serene and indifferent—such is the nature of the Dao, subtle and unfathomable.
No sound is heard, for it transcends sound; no form is seen, for it transcends color. Yet I am compelled to name it, calling it the Dao.
Since it is neither sound nor color, it is nameless, wordless, beyond speech or description.
What is spoken here is not its true designation, hence it is called a “forced name.”

The Dao is lofty beyond reach, deep beyond measure.
Devoid of form or image, how could its height or depth be gauged?
It enfolds heaven and earth, bestowing without shape.
Its source flows ceaselessly like water, ever full yet never overflowing, ever drawn yet never depleted.
*Chuochuo*: the appearance of water welling forth.
When turbid, it gradually clarifies through stillness—so too does motion settle into quiet, and murkiness into clarity.
Its bounty is inexhaustible, unbound by time, its generosity extending beyond any single dawn or dusk.
Though manifest, it does not fill a grasp; though tangible, it eludes form.
Contracted, it can expand; obscure, it can illuminate; supple, it can be firm.
It embraces yin and exhales yang, revealing the three luminaries.
Spoken in obscurity, its brightness rivals the three celestial lights.
Spoken in softness, its sharpness cuts through metal and stone.
Thus, it can be yin or yang, soft or hard, great or small, short or long.
Turn toward it, and it abides; turn away, and it vanishes.
It is neither this nor that, its transformations boundless.
By it, mountains rise in height, abysses plumb their depths.
By it, beasts run, birds fly, unicorns swim, phoenixes soar, and the stars traverse their courses.
How could the loftiness of mountains, the profundity of abysses, the swimming of unicorns, the soaring of phoenixes, or the unerring movements of celestial bodies arise from anything but the mysterious resonance of perfect governance?

Through nonbeing, it attains being; through humility, it gains honor; through retreat, it takes the lead.
This means: by relinquishing life, one preserves the self; by humbling oneself, one is exalted; by yielding, one advances.
The nature of the Dao delights in modesty, and thus modesty brings benefit.

In ancient times, the Three Sovereigns grasped the thread of the Dao, standing at the center and roaming in spirit with transformation to govern the four directions—the Three Sovereigns being Fuxi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor.
In ruling the world, their spirit moved within, while their virtue and grace overflowed without.
Thus, they could emulate the heavens’ motion and the earth’s stillness, their wheel turning without cease, their waters flowing without end, accompanying all things from beginning to end.
Winds arose and clouds gathered, thunder resounded and rain descended, all responding without limit.
*The heavens move; the earth rests.*
This speaks of the sage who models the heavens’ activity and the earth’s tranquility, aligning with the beginnings and endings of the ten thousand things.
Issuing decrees and commands, thunder rolls and winds rise, clouds drift and rain falls, nurturing and sustaining all beings, responding to change without end.

Carved and polished, it returns to simplicity.
Cultivating truth and prudence in conduct—this is what is meant by “polishing.” Yet when one severs dependence and congeals in emptiness, one naturally reverts to simplicity.
Acting without acting, it harmonizes with life and death.
The Great Dao is without intent, allowing things to follow their nature—hence it is called “nonaction.”
Life cannot but live, for life is natural.
Death cannot but die, for death is natural—thus it harmonizes with life and death.
Speaking without speaking, it communicates virtue; tranquil and unassuming, it attains harmony.
This means: without words, it reaches virtue; without affectation, it achieves harmony.
Though the ten thousand things differ, they all thrive in accord with their nature.
It harmonizes yin and yang, regulates the four seasons, and adjusts the five phases.
Yin and yang harmonize the four seasons, which in turn regulate the five phases—this is the constant Way.
This does not mean the sage alters or creates anew, but rather that he humbly observes human affairs, emulates the heavens’ timing, and discerns the people’s sentiments, preventing wickedness and ushering in great peace.
It moistens grasses and trees, seeps into metal and stone.
Birds and beasts grow large, their fur lustrous; eggs do not spoil, and animal fetuses do not miscarry.
*Sound: dú.*
The Dao’s efficacy prevails, and all things fulfill their growth without harming one another.

Fathers know no grief of losing sons, elder brothers no day of weeping for younger brothers. Above, governance flows smoothly; below, none rebel. Children are not orphaned, nor do they die untimely. Women are not widowed, all secure in their bonds. Rainbows and miasmas vanish, evil qi conceals itself. Bandits and thieves cease their ways, and the world attains great harmony—all brought forth by the power of embodied virtue.

The blessings just named all arise from the sage’s nurturing influence. The constant Way of heaven generates and transforms without end, giving life yet possessing nothing, perfecting transformations yet ruling nothing. In "possessing nothing" lies the wondrous presence of being; in "ruling nothing" appears the true ruler. The ten thousand things depend on it to live, yet none know its virtue; they depend on it to die, yet none can resent it. Life is not mine to claim—whom should I thank? Death is not mine to inflict—whom should I blame? It gathers and stores yet grows no richer, distributes and bestows yet suffers no poverty. Hoarded, it never overflows; scattered, it never empties.

Vague and elusive, it defies representation; fleeting and indistinct, its use knows no limit. Profound and obscure, it responds to transformations without form. In the space between fleeting and indistinct, its responses are inexhaustible. At the threshold of the profound and obscure, its changes are boundless. Traced to its source, it seems to hold something; pursued further, it has no shape. Flowing and unobstructed, it never acts in vain. Its spiritual workings complete, its principles never respond falsely.

It coils and unfurls with hardness and softness, rises and falls with yin and yang, bending and stretching with the seasons. Laozi said: "The great man who embodies the Dao is serene, without thought; tranquil, without worry. Moving with the Dao, why trouble with thoughts and concerns?"

Taking heaven as his canopy, earth as his chariot, the four seasons as his horses, and yin and yang as his charioteer, he travels where there are no roads, roams without rest, and exits where there are no gates. With heaven as his canopy, nothing is left uncovered; with earth as his chariot, nothing is left uncarried. With the four seasons as his horses, nothing is left uncommanded; with yin and yang as his charioteer, nothing is left unprepared. The great man rides the uprightness of heaven and earth, harnesses the movements of yin and yang, traverses boundless realms, and roams the inexhaustible Dao—how magnificent is this!

Thus, swift yet unshaken, distant yet untiring, his four limbs unmoved, his clarity and insight undiminished, he illuminates all under heaven—grasping the essence of the Dao to observe the limitless. Holding fast to the Dao’s essence, he surveys the eight directions as if in his palm. The subtlety of perfect governance resides in the square inch of the heart. How could he exhaust himself racing near and far?

Therefore, the affairs of the world cannot be forced; those who force them invite failure. Push forward by following their natural course, and nothing will fail to flourish. The changes of the ten thousand things cannot be rescued; grasp their essence and return to it. Though their transformations are manifold, their essence can be precisely discerned.

Thus, the sage cultivates his root within and does not adorn his branches without. He rectifies his heart within and rejects extraneous arts without. He sharpens his spirit to attain inner clarity and stills his knowledge and perceptions to halt what is not the Dao. Thus, he is effortlessly inactive yet accomplishes everything, governs without governing yet nothing is left ungoverned. The so-called "non-action" does not precede the things themselves; "non-governance" does not alter the natural. "Nothing is left ungoverned" follows the mutual arising of things. When things are allowed to be as they may, then nothing is not as it should be. When governance follows what can be governed, then nothing is left ungoverned.

Laozi said: "He who holds the Dao to govern the people responds to matters as they arise, follows things as they move. The transformations of the ten thousand things all find their response; the changes of a hundred affairs all find their match." This means that when the sage governs the world, he stabilizes human affairs according to their convenience, and thus the people cannot but be transformed, and all things cannot but harmonize.

Thus, the Dao is empty and formless, level and easy, clear and still, soft and weak, pure and unadorned—these five are the forms and images of the Dao. Without possessing these five virtues, one cannot perceive the form of the formless or the image of the imageless.

Emptiness and formlessness are the dwelling of the Dao. "Dwelling" means residence. Levelness and ease are the simplicity of the Dao. "Simplicity" means essence. Clarity and stillness are the mirror of the Dao. "Mirror" means illumination. Softness and weakness are the function of the Dao. "Function" means penetration. Reversal is the constant of the Dao. The common use is action; the Dao’s use is non-action. Softness is the hardness of the Dao; weakness is the strength of the Dao. Accumulated softness becomes hardness; accumulated weakness becomes strength. Purity, simplicity, and unadornedness are the trunk of the Dao.

Emptiness means the center holds nothing; levelness means the heart bears no burdens. Desire and craving do not burden—this is the perfection of emptiness. Having no likes or dislikes—this is the perfection of levelness. Unchanging unity—this is the perfection of stillness. Unmixed with things—this is the perfection of purity. Free from sorrow and joy—this is the perfection of virtue. These resolve the five meanings.

In the governance of the perfected man, he discards his cleverness and does not adorn his wisdom. He erases his embellishments and preserves his simplicity. Following the Dao, he abandons cunning and fulfills the way of clarity and emptiness, casting off deluded and false wisdom. He emerges with the people from the public, without private motives. He restricts what he holds, reduces what he seeks, relinquishes his temptations and longings, removes his desires and avarice, and casts aside his thoughts and concerns.

Restricting what he holds leads to discernment; reducing what he seeks leads to attainment. When the heart attains unity, it masters the arts of the ten thousand things. Restriction enables subtle understanding; reduction enables the governance of the many. Thus, controlling the external with the internal, nothing is left undone. If the internal attains it, the external can be shepherded. The attainment of the internal—"internal" refers to the ruler in a state and the heart in a person. When the ruler is enlightened, the state is at peace; when the heart is upright, the body is governed. Thus, controlling the external with the internal, the world has no equal. Controlling the internal with the external leads to success or failure. Knowing both internal and external, no action fails.

The great man rides the uprightness of heaven and earth, harnesses the movements of yin and yang, traverses boundless realms, and roams the inexhaustible Dao—how could this not be magnificent?

The five viscera at peace, thoughts and reflections balanced, sinews and bones firm and strong, ears and eyes keen and bright—all arise from guarding the center. The great Dao is smooth and broad, not far from the self; those who seek it afar go forth only to return. To wade far and lose the ford, not knowing to seek it near within oneself—

Laozi said: The sage forgets governing others and attends to self-cultivation; values forgetting power and rank and attends to self-attainment. In self-attainment, the world attains me. Never has one whose own person is ungoverned been able to govern others, nor one in power who does not overbear others. Only in self-attainment does one not overbear. In self-attainment, what I love, others also love. With my feelings, I grasp theirs—thus it is called self-attainment. In self-attainment, the feelings of the world are all attained by me. Joy forgets wealth and nobility and resides in harmony; only one who does not overbear preserves harmony and joy amid wealth and nobility.

To know the greatness of the self and make the world small is near to the Dao. Attaining the Dao, though the self is slight, one may possess the world—thus the self is great. Losing the Dao, though the world is vast, there is nowhere to contain the self—thus the world is small.

Thus it is said: Utmost emptiness, profound stillness—all things arise together, and I observe their return. Things arise from emptiness and stillness, thus returning to the root is called stillness. Stillness is called the restoration of life, meaning the endless cycle of going and returning, where the myriad things never end.

The Dao shapes and nurtures the myriad things, beginning and ending without form, motionless and silent, vast and boundlessly obscure. The Dao is tranquil and vast, a great furnace molding clay, beginning in formlessness. Within it lies something, yet it ends without form. Who knows its limit? It resides in boundless obscurity, beyond the ken of gods and spirits.

Vast and deep, broad and great, it cannot be made external; minute and subtle, it cannot be made internal. Without walls or enclosure, the greatest cannot be sought outside, the smallest cannot be grasped within. It gives rise to the general name of being and non-being. Speak of non-being, and all categories teem forth; speak of being, and no shape or sign appears. This is the essence of non-action, the subtlety of existing things—the general name of the myriad things arises between being and non-being.

The true person embodies emptiness and non-being, simplicity and ease, purity and stillness, softness and weakness, unadulterated plainness, not mingling with things. This is the virtue and Dao of heaven and earth—thus they are called true persons. Their body aligns with emptiness and non-being, their virtue harmonizes with heaven and earth—thus they are true persons.

The true person knows the greatness of the self and makes the world small, values governing the self and disdains governing others. From the human perspective, the world seems vast; from the Dao’s perspective, the world is small. Viewed from afar, governing others seems base; viewed from near, governing the self is noble.

Not allowing things to disturb harmony, not allowing desires to disorder the feelings—if the heart is not moved by things, how can feelings be disordered by desires? They conceal their name and identity, drifting with the times, flowing with the俗, yet none know them—this is the utmost concealment. When the Dao prevails, they withdraw and remain silent; when the Dao is absent, they exert themselves and cultivate it. They act without acting, engage in affairs without affairs, know without knowing. They act without reliance, engage without pride, know without display.

Embracing the heavenly Dao, encompassing the heart of heaven, they exhale and inhale yin and yang, expel the old and take in the new. With yin, they close; with yang, they open. With hardness and softness, they contract and extend; with yin and yang, they bow and rise. Their heart is one with heaven, their body one with the Dao. Exhaling and inhaling follow principle, contraction and extension are fitting, movement and stillness have rhythm, bending and stretching accord with the seasons.

No joy, no sorrow, no delight, no anger—the myriad things are profoundly the same, without right or wrong. Sorrow and joy do not cling to the heart, delight and anger do not show on the face. Encountering things, they remain true—thus it is called profound sameness.

When the body is harmed by the ravages of cold, heat, dryness, and dampness, the form is exhausted and the spirit blocked. When the spirit is harmed by the afflictions of joy, anger, thought, and worry, the spirit is spent and the form remains in excess. Cold and heat assail from without, joy and anger arise within. As the spirit departs, though the remaining form persists—how can it endure long?

Thus the true person employs the heart-mind to restore nature, relying on spirit for mutual support, and so attains wholeness from beginning to end. Therefore, their sleep is dreamless, and their waking is carefree.

The true person knows how yin and yang harm the upright, discards partial and biased emotions, and nurtures a nature of tranquility and indifference—thus body and spirit sustain each other, and worry and dreams do not intrude.

When Confucius asked about the Dao, Laozi said: "Correct your form, unify your gaze, and the harmony of Heaven will arrive. When the form is unified and upright, the four limbs are all proper; when the heart-mind is level, no deviant influences oppose it; when perception is unified, all encounters are real. Cut off all deliberation, and the harmony of Heaven will come of itself.

"Gather in your knowledge, rectify your measure, and spirit will come to dwell. Virtue will become your countenance, the Dao will become your dwelling. Without other knowledge, abiding by constant measure—then spirit will respond without fail, virtue will embrace all, and the Dao will be present everywhere.

"Bright-eyed as a newly born calf, without seeking its former state—this is called concentrating qi to attain suppleness, seeking only nourishment from the mother, with no other concerns.

"Form like withered wood, heart-mind like dead ashes—unaware of form as form, heart-mind as heart-mind. Is it withered wood? Dead ashes? Truly, they know reality without distortion, thus they maintain a vast and unfettered state, with no heart-mind to scheme, luminous in all four directions—can they be without knowledge?

"This is called the formless form, the heart-mindless heart-mind, which cannot be described in appearance or sought in location. Vast and unbounded, it cannot be planned; measured, it attains its singularity in all four directions—can it be without knowledge? This is called true knowledge."

Laozi said: "Those who attend to life respond to change and act; change arises from the times, and those who know the times follow no fixed course. They must respond to what comes, adapting to the moment—what is prized is knowing the moment; how could there be a constant way?

"Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. Responding to the times, how could there be a fixed method? Writing arises from words, and words emerge from wisdom—but the wise do not know, for it is not the constant Dao.

"By 'writing' is meant the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*; by 'words' are meant the sayings of former kings and sages. All are like straw dogs used in sacrifice—not the constant Dao. The name that can be named is not the one who treasures books.

"Inscribing on bamboo and silk, engraving on metal and jade—this is the name that can be named. Yet once names arise, there is truth and falsehood. Thus, writing does not convey true names; it is not real.

"Much learning leads to exhaustion; it is better to guard the center. Much learning exhausts one’s strength; guarding the One requires no labor. Abandon learning and there is no worry; discard sagacity and renounce knowledge, and the people benefit a hundredfold. Cease what is not the Dao, remove ostentation and bias, know and rely on the One Origin—thus there is a hundredfold benefit.

"Human beings are tranquil at birth—this is Heaven’s nature. Stirred by things, they move—this is the desire of nature. When things arrive and one responds, this is the movement of wisdom. When wisdom engages with things, likes and dislikes arise; when likes and dislikes take shape, wisdom is externalized, and one cannot return to oneself—Heavenly principle is extinguished.

"Nature is tranquil, but desire moves; when things are sensed, harm follows. Wisdom gives rise to calamity, desire disorders the real; likes and dislikes are born, and gain and loss arise. Unable to reflect and return to true nature, one brings about self-destruction.

"Therefore, the sage does not exchange Heaven for man, externally transforming with things while inwardly not losing their true state. Thus, those who penetrate the Dao return to clarity and stillness; those who possess the Dao are clear and still. Those who exhaust themselves in things ultimately attain non-action. External things—hence, non-action.

"Nurture wisdom with tranquility, unite spirit with indifference—then one enters the gateless gate. Wisdom does not arise without stillness; spirit does not respond without quiescence. Response emerges from the gateless gate. One roams the gateless gate, following Heaven and wandering with the Dao—this means guarding emptiness and stillness. Those who follow others exchange with the vulgar—this means clinging to fame and power.

"Thus, the sage does not disturb Heaven with affairs, does not disorder the true state with desires, does not deliberate yet is fitting, does not speak yet is trusted—like the Heavenly Dao, without intention, like the four seasons, mysteriously attuned. Without thought, they attain; without action, they accomplish. Attainment is not through toiling thought; accomplishment is not through effort.

"Therefore, though they dwell above, the people do not find them burdensome; though they stand before others, none are harmed. The world turns to them, and the treacherous and perverse fear them—because they do not contend with the myriad things, none dare contend with them. Where utmost virtue extends, the treacherous decline and hide. The myriad people bear them without burden; none in the world dare contend with them."

Laozi said: "When people follow desire and lose their nature, their movements are never upright. With this, to govern a state is to bring chaos; to cultivate the self is to bring defilement. The harm of desire—destroying states and ruining lives—its response is like an echo. How can one not be warned?

"Thus, those who do not hear the Dao cannot return to their nature; those who do not understand things cannot attain clarity and stillness. Unclear about the principles of the Dao, unenlightened about the conditions of things, they cannot return to the origin and restore simplicity.

"The original nature of human beings is without depravity or defilement. Long immersed in things, it changes; changed and forgetting its root, it merges with what seems like its nature. The original human nature is utterly still and unaware; stirred by things, it moves—this is desire harming the real, decline obscuring the upright. The deluded do not awaken, taking this as their true nature. If they do not transform throughout their lives, how grievous is this?

"The nature of water desires clarity, but sand and stone defile it; the nature of human beings desires equilibrium, but cravings and desires harm it. Only the sage can forsake things and return to the self. The nature of water is originally clear—defilement lies in sand and stone. The nature of human beings is originally balanced—harm lies in cravings and desires. Only the sage can forsake things and return to the self.

"Therefore, the sage does not employ wisdom to enslave things, does not use desire to disturb harmony. Their joy is not exultant, their sorrow is not mournful. *Wū guàn qiē*—taking joy in joy, when joy reaches its extreme, sorrow follows."

Those who take sorrow as sorrow never forget their sorrow. Thus, they stand high yet do not peril, rest secure yet do not topple, preserving emptiness and purity—what fear have they of collapse or danger?

Therefore, when good counsel and sound plans are heard, even fools delight in them; when the sagely virtue and lofty conduct are praised, even the unworthy yearn for them. If fools still know to turn toward and admire such things, how much more the worthy and virtuous? Many delight in such words, yet few put them into practice; many admire such ways, yet few walk them. Though those who rejoice and yearn number in the tens of thousands, none advance in cultivation. Why is this? Because they are shackled by things and struck by custom, ensnared by gluttony for flavors and fettered by the shackles of fame and profit.

Thus it is said: "I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I remain without affairs, and the people enrich themselves; I love stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I am without desire, and the people return to simplicity." This makes clear that when the ruler models these four principles, governing from above, the people are transformed below.

Stillness and purity are the perfection of virtue; softness and weakness are the function of the Dao. Emptiness, tranquility, and joy are the ancestors of the ten thousand things. When these three are practiced, one merges into formlessness—formlessness is called "the One." The One is the mindless union with all under heaven. The One is non-being. It speaks of the formless moving through the world, pervading the ten thousand things without end.

Virtue is spread without exhaustion, employed without toil; no moisture can moisten it, no mind can weary it. It cannot be seen, cannot be heard. So subtle it transcends sound—how could it be heard or seen? From formlessness, form arises; from soundlessness, the five tones resound; from tastelessness, the five flavors take shape; from colorlessness, the five colors emerge. Thus, being arises from non-being, substance from emptiness.

The number of tones does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five tones cannot be fully heard; the number of flavors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five flavors cannot be fully tasted; the number of colors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five colors cannot be fully seen. Form, sound, color, and flavor all arise from nothing. Tracing them to their fundamental number, they do not exceed five. Yet from these five, endless transformations arise, losing their constancy. Pushed to excess and decadence, they surpass what sight and hearing can fathom, what constant observation can discern.

When the tone *gong* is established, the five tones take shape; when sweetness is established, the five flavors are fixed; when whiteness is established, the five colors are formed; when the One is established, the ten thousand things are born. All the above take the One as their foundation. Thus, things attain constancy through the One, and people attain transformation and brilliance through their master. The Dao unifies as One, and the ten thousand things flourish abundantly. Therefore, the principle of the One extends throughout the four seas without difference; the scrutiny of the One pervades heaven and earth.

Those who comprehend the One understand the root of heaven and earth’s creation and the nature of the ten thousand things. In its wholeness, it is thick and uncarved; outwardly, it appears foolish to others. When dispersed, it is vast and turbid, its traces obscured by custom. Though turbid, it gradually clears; though empty, it gradually fills. Turbid yet able to clear, empty yet able to fill. Vast and still like the great sea, boundless and without shore. Drifting like floating clouds, whither does it go? As if non-being yet being, as if perishing yet enduring. Neither non-being nor being, yet able to endure or vanish—this describes the one who embodies the Dao.

Laozi said: "The sum of the ten thousand things all passes through a single aperture; the root of a hundred affairs all emerges from a single gate." The ten thousand things and ten thousand affairs all issue from the gate of manifold subtleties. Thus, the sage follows a single track, never altering its constancy, never changing its regularity, aligning with the plumb line and following the carpenter’s square, bending to accommodate its constancy.

The sage follows the origin of the great Dao, examining the nature of the ten thousand things, not forcing land-dwellers into the depths or tree-nesters into caves—this is not altering their constancy. Each attaches to what brings ease, all benefiting their nature—this is bending to accommodate its constancy.

Joy and anger are the deviations of the Dao; sorrow and grief are the losses of virtue; likes and dislikes are the transgressions of the heart; cravings and desires are the burdens of life. These eight are what the great man does not dwell in. Great anger shatters *yin*; great joy topples *yang*; thin *qi* brings dimness; terror and fear induce madness; sorrow and grief scorch the heart, giving rise to accumulations of illness. If one can eliminate these five, they align with spirit illumination. These five are the utmost sincerity in cultivating the self.

People know to refine gold and smelt stone in pursuit of longevity, yet cannot moderate desires and pacify harmony to preserve their heavenly nature. Moreover, joy and anger arise recklessly—what use are medicinal stones? If one truly grasps this principle, they naturally align with spirit illumination. Spirit illumination is attained internally. Those who attain it internally have peaceful organs, balanced thoughts, keen hearing and sight, and strong sinews and bones.

Those who attain internally embrace emptiness and guard the One, their spirit at ease and thoughts serene—thus their ears and eyes are keen, their sinews and bones strong. Open and unobstructed, they do not contend with things; firm yet not exhausted, they employ softness without lack. Never excessive, never deficient. Desires do not exceed measure, and nothing they do fails to succeed.

Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet water embodies the Dao. This is a metaphor to convey principle, using water to clarify the Dao. Its breadth cannot be fathomed, its depth cannot be measured; its length extends without end, its reach pervades without limit. Its ebb and flow, increase and decrease surpass all reckoning. Above, it becomes heaven’s rain and dew; below, it becomes earth’s moisture and nourishment. The ten thousand things cannot but live, the hundred affairs cannot but succeed. It embraces all life without partiality, bestowing its blessings even upon the lowliest creatures without seeking repayment. It enriches all under heaven without exhaustion, bestows virtue upon the people without cost. Its course cannot be exhausted, its subtlety cannot be grasped. Struck, it is not wounded; pierced, it is not injured; severed, it is not cut; scorched, it is not burned. Supple and flowing, it cannot be scattered. It penetrates metal and stone, overcomes all under heaven. Abundant or scant, it allows all to take or give. It endows the ten thousand things without precedence or delay, without partiality or impartiality, vast and equal with heaven and earth—this is called utmost virtue.

That by which water fulfills its utmost virtue lies in its supple smoothness. Thus it is said: "The softest under heaven courses through the hardest under heaven, entering where there are no crevices." Water, foremost among the Five Phases, attains the One and thus the Dao succors all under heaven, its virtue harmonizing with the ten thousand kinds. Its benevolence extends to grasses and trees, its righteousness hardens like metal and stone, its trustworthiness aligns with the four seasons, its wisdom flows without end. Thus the soft cannot be severed, the hard cannot be broken; in motion it commands awe, in strength it knows no rival. Scattered, it becomes rain and dew; gathered, it forms springs and fountains. Used, it is never exhausted; bestowed, its reach is boundless. Defiled, it remains unstained; purified, it preserves its wholeness. How vast is the virtue of water, in harmony with the Dao!

That which is formless is the great ancestor of things; that which is soundless is the great progenitor of kinds. All things arise from the formless, the five tones emerge from the soundless. Thus the utmost void, though ungiving, gives birth—hence the void is the ancestor and progenitor of things. The Perfected Person, penetrating the numinous treasury, becomes one with the Creator, holding fast to dark virtue in the heart, transforming with spirit-like swiftness. Therefore, the Dao that is not a Dao—how vast and indistinct! Without issuing commands or decrees, it shifts customs and alters mores—this is the work of the heart’s conduct.

All things have their source yet alone return to their root; all affairs have their origin yet alone guard their gate. Thus one may exhaust the inexhaustible, reach the unreachable, illuminate things without dazzling, respond to echoes without knowing. Within, one attains the unity of the heart; without, one connects with the ten thousand existences. The Dao of submerging and floating transforms like a spirit, its responses boundless—who knows its limit?

Laozi said: "Those who attain the Dao have wills that are weak yet affairs that are strong, hearts that are empty yet responses that are fitting." A weak will is gentle, tranquil, and serene, concealed in non-acquisition, acting in incapacity, tranquil in non-action, moving without missing the moment—this is what it means to attain. The Dao of non-action follows what is fitting for things, moving in accord with the proper time. Thus the noble must take the lowly as its root, the high must take the low as its foundation. Dust gathers to form mountains, streams accumulate to become seas. Entrusting the small to encompass the great, residing within to govern without, acting with softness yet firmness—strength knows no defeat, no enemy can overpower. With an empty heart, one precedes things: though without force, one is strong, and wherever one goes, all is accomplished, none dare encroach or insult. Adapting to transformations and measuring the times, none can harm. Moving in tandem with the Dao, what thing could cause harm?

Those who desire firmness must guard it with softness; those who desire strength must preserve it with weakness. Accumulate softness and it becomes firm; accumulate weakness and it becomes strong. Observe what is accumulated, and you will know survival or ruin. Know firmness, know softness—then virtue is truly cultivated. Know survival, know ruin—then the self will surely flourish. Strength can overcome those weaker than oneself, but when it encounters its equal, it is checked. The strong cannot be overcome, the weak cannot be oppressed—this is the Dao of acting with softness. Softness can overcome those stronger than oneself—its power is immeasurable. Do not lightly scorn, for it may surpass you.

Thus when armies are strong, they perish; when wood is hard, it snaps; when leather is stiff, it splits. Those who rely on strength do not preserve their material whole. Teeth are harder than the tongue yet perish first—observing the principle of teeth and tongue, one may discern the Dao of firmness and softness. Thus the firm meets ruin, while the soft obtains wholeness. Therefore, softness and weakness are the pivot of life, while firmness and strength are the companions of death. Circumstances summon one another, and life and death may be verified.

The one who leads falls into exhaustion; the one who follows reaches the source. Holding to the latter ensures one is not subdued. Those who grasp the Dao to pair with change—whether first or last, each controls the other. How can one fail to master others when others cannot master them? This is to seize the mechanism of transformation, which none can comprehend. Preceding others invites no resistance; following others accords with what is fitting. Mastering both precedence and subsequence, acting and resting in non-action—this is grasping the Dao to pair with change.

The so-called "following" is to harmonize one’s measures with the proper time. When the time changes, there is no gap for even a breath. Preceding it is excessive; following it is insufficient. Affairs have their proper moments, things have their successes and failures, movements in perilous mechanisms allow no pause for a breath. It lies in harmonizing measures and awaiting the time, aiming for the mean without error.

The sun revolves, the moon orbits—time does not tarry with man. Thus the sage does not value a foot-long jade but treasures an inch of time. Time is hard to obtain yet easily lost, so the sage acts in accord with the time and establishes merit based on resources. The sage does not prize amassing treasures but values preserving the Dao. Cherishing the fleeting light of time, the rare encounter of opportunity—when acting to achieve success, one must not miss the moment.

Abide by the pure Dao, restrain oneself with feminine restraint, follow along and respond to change, always remaining behind and never ahead. Soft and weak in stillness, composed and settled in tranquility—great achievements know no firmness, none can contend with them. Thus embodying purity and stillness, holding to feminine weakness, one attacks the strong under heaven—does this not mean seizing the proper time without contention?

Laozi said: "When the heart harbors the mechanisms of cunning, even purity and whiteness are not unsullied." If scheming and cleverness are not forgotten, the dark Dao grows ever more distant. When numinous virtue is not complete within the self, how can one know what distant harm may befall? Near, one loses the self; far, one loses others.

When the heart forgets the desire to harm, even a starving tiger may be tailed—how much more so with people! When the desire to harm is forgotten within, though one treads upon a starving tiger’s tail or stands before a violent man, one will ultimately suffer no harm.

Those who embody the Dao are at ease yet never exhausted; those who attain the governance of the Dao never rest even in death. Those who rely on calculations labor without achievement. Those who exhaust numerological arts labor without benefit.

Ruling through harsh laws and punishments is not the work of emperors and kings; frequent use of the whip and rod is not the way to drive far. Excessive punishments breed resentment among the people; frequent whipping makes horses unruly. Excessive likes and dislikes invite calamity to follow—this is the principle of nature.

Thus, the laws of the former kings were not what they created but what they followed; their prohibitions and punishments were not what they enacted but what they upheld. They did not rely solely on execution and killing to seek the people’s welfare—expelling the wicked, meting small punishments to admonish great faults, which is the blessing of petty men.

Therefore, following brings greatness, while contriving brings pettiness; upholding brings stability, while acting brings ruin. As when Great Yu governed the waters: he followed the people’s plight, for their suffering could not be endured. He dredged rivers along the mountains, cut channels to guide the flow, rescuing the times and saving from peril, ensuring no harm befell them. How majestic was his success—this was the power of following. When Shang Yang of Qin created laws and altered standards, rewarding those who obeyed the present and punishing those who violated the statutes, in a single day he executed over seven hundred, turning the Wei River red. Later, he himself died by dismemberment—what he harmed was great, what he achieved was small, and what he upheld was not secure. Those who act bring ruin.

Relying on ears and eyes to hear and see wearies the mind yet brings no clarity; governing through cunning and calculation exhausts the heart yet yields no success. If one’s ears and eyes, mind and thoughts are spent, how can one speak of sufficiency? To hear without listening, to see without looking, to act without intention, to succeed without deliberation—this is what the perfected person values.

Relying on the talent of one person is insufficient to achieve perfect governance; the ability of one person cannot manage even three acres of land. If one overreaches, strength is dispersed and cannot suffice. Following the principles of the Dao and the natural order of heaven and earth, even the six directions are not too vast to harmonize. By adapting to what is fitting and measuring one’s strength, even the vastness of the six directions can be balanced, and the multitude of the ten thousand things can be thoroughly mastered.

Hearing is misled by praise and blame, confused by likes and dislikes. The eyes are seduced by colors and beauty; ritual and propriety are insufficient to restrain desire, but sincerity of heart can embrace what is distant. Words and rites cannot guard against transgression, but the heart alone can illuminate the subtle.

Thus, no weapon is sharper than the will, yet *Mo Ye* and *Po Ya* are inferior; no enemy is greater than yin and yang, yet war drums are trivial. The so-called great enemy leaves corpses without restraint; the middling enemy hides in the mountains; the petty enemy lurks among the people. The five weapons are but the dregs of the Dao. Yin and yang are the greatest enemies—this is the Dao. *Mo Ye*, *Po Ya*, drums, and gongs have form and sharpness, sound and might. The supreme Dao has no sharpness yet can sever, no might yet can subdue. Thus, though *Mo Ye* is sharp, the Dao is inferior to it; though drums retain their sound, they are trivial beside the Dao.

Yin and yang are the love and aversion of male and female. Wherever desire for profit arises, the heart follows emotion, and in the space between acceptance and rejection, there must be the peril of life and death. Thus, the great enemy hides in the breast, and the petty enemy lurks among the people. Therefore, the perfected person is cautious within and restrained without.

Thus it is said: when the people abound in cleverness and skill, strange things proliferate; when laws and decrees multiply, thieves and bandits increase. Abandoning one to take the other prevents heavenly calamity from arising. Governing a state with excessive laws brings chaos to the people—chaos is the omen of ruin. Governing the self with excessive rules wearies the body—weariness is the sign of decay. Abandoning that cleverness and those laws, embracing this clarity and stillness, heavenly calamity naturally ceases.

Thus, governing a state with cleverness is the state’s bane; not governing a state with cleverness is the state’s virtue. The perfected person sees cleverness as a bane; the worldly see it as virtue. Using it brings harm; not using it brings blessing.

The formless is great; the formed is small. The formless is many; the formed is few. The formless is strong; the formed is weak. The formless is solid; the formed is hollow. Where there is great and small, there is many and few; where there is few, form is small—this is the smallness of the formed. Where there is no great or small, there is no many or few. Where there is no few, there is no form—this is the greatness of the formless.

The great and small, many and few, strong and weak, solid and hollow—all arise from this. The formed is the completion of affairs; it originates from the formless, whose name cannot be known. Following things, it is named the completion of affairs. The formless is the beginning of creation; the completion of affairs is the making of vessels. The beginning is simplicity; simplicity scatters and becomes vessels.

The formed has sound; the formless has no sound. The formed is born of the formless—thus, the formless is the beginning of the formed. The Dao is not nothing; what is born is something. Through birth, one awakens to the Dao; when the body exists, there is nothingness. Thus, sound emerges without inquiry; form exists with a beginning.

Vastness and thickness have names—what has a name is prized for its wholeness. This speaks of the named as the name of the nameless, not seeking a name. If one seeks a name, how can wholeness be prized? Frugality and thinness have no name—what has no name is base and light. This speaks of the nameless not as the name of the nameless, but as one who cuts oneself off in ignorance, not knowing the name of the great Dao.

Abundance and wealth have names—what has a name is honored and cherished. Poverty and scarcity have no name—what has no name is lowly and despised. With the Dao, one is honored; without the Dao, one is disgraced. The male has a name—what has a name is manifest and bright. The female has no name—what has no name is hidden and subtle. If not for the use of the male, how could the name be whole? If not for embracing the female, how could the nameless be whole? Obscurity and clarity, concealment and display—all rest in my having or lacking, my abiding or stagnating.

Surplus has a name—what has a name is exalted and wise. Deficiency has no name—what has no name is tasked with the lowly. Not prizing one’s name is surplus; not exalting oneself yet being exalted is not wisdom. Not cultivating one’s name is deficiency; not lowering oneself yet being lowly is folly.

Merit brings a name; lack of merit brings no name. The Dao does not respond in vain. The named is born of the nameless—the nameless is the mother of the named. Thus, the Dao gives rise to being and non-being, difficulty and ease complete each other.

Being does not arise from being but is born of non-being. Difficulty does not arise from difficulty but is completed through ease. Knowing that being is insufficient, one must guard the mother to preserve the child.

Knowing that difficulty does not arise from difficulty, one must make the difficult through the easy.
Yet things do not move in isolation—matters depend on mutual support.
Thus the sage holds to the Dao in emptiness, stillness, subtlety, and wonder, thereby perfecting their virtue.
Forgetting the mechanism, illumination arises.
Therefore, where there is the Dao, there is virtue; where there is virtue, there is merit; where there is merit, there is a name; where there is a name, it returns once more to the Dao.
When Dao and virtue are cultivated, merit and name naturally follow.
What is possessed is not truly mine—it is possessed of itself.
Not knowing to whom it belongs, it returns to the Dao.
Merit and name endure long, and one remains free from blame throughout life.
Preserving merit and name wholly, one is naturally free from regret.
Kings and dukes possess merit and name; the orphaned and widowed possess no merit and name.
Thus the sage calls themselves orphaned and widowed, returning to their root.
Only the sage can establish merit without merit, a name without a name.
Though possessing such merit and name, they still style themselves orphaned and widowed—this is to guard the feminine, the yielding, and return to simplicity.

Merit is achieved yet not possessed.
Thus merit is used for benefit, and namelessness is employed for function.
Merit benefits things yet does not display itself; namelessness is constantly employed yet inexhaustible.
In ancient times, the people were simple and unlearned.
Though their words were established, they remained like children.
They knew not east from west, making no distinctions.
Their appearance did not depart from their nature, and heaven’s harmony followed.
Words did not exceed actions; actions proceeded without pretense.
Movement accorded with the Dao, and speech was unadorned—valuing substance.
Their clothing was warm yet without ornament, adding no embellishment.
Their weapons were blunt and without edge, not fashioning instruments of harm.
Their gait was halting and deliberate.
Their gaze was dim and unfocused, like that of an infant.
They drank from the well they dug, ate from the fields they tilled.
Beyond clothing and food, they sought nothing more.
They did not bestow charity nor seek virtue.
High and low did not vie with one another; long and short did not compare.
Externally, they sought no repayment; internally, they did not pray for virtue.
Silently aligning with the true Dao, they obscurely accorded with heaven’s principle.
When the wind conforms to custom, it may be followed; when affairs match one’s ability, they are easily done.
Commands need not be issued, yet customs naturally align; people have no desires, and affairs naturally simplify.
Those who flaunt deceit to delude the world, or act perversely to mislead the multitude—
the sage does not take them as the people’s norm.
For to engage in deception and falsity, to act with perversity and crookedness, is to delude the world and mislead the multitude—
this is what the sage does not do.

Purity and sincerity—purity is clarity, sincerity is trust. Sincerity is heaven’s nature; purity is man’s clarity. Sincerity is upheld by the will, clarity is distinguished by discernment. Without the utmost sincerity under heaven, how could one fully realize the natures of all beings and unite with heaven and earth’s virtue? Thus it is said: without purity and sincerity, one cannot move others—this is what it means.

Laozi said: Heaven attains its height, earth attains its depth; the sun shines, the stars gleam; yin and yang harmonize—not through deliberate action. What is achieved by non-action arises not from desire. Align with the Dao, and things naturally follow. When the ruler rectifies himself, the people are transformed as if by spirit; the teaching of no words has no equal.

The four seasons and yin-yang do not generate the myriad things; timely rain and dew do not nourish grasses and trees. Yet when spirit and clarity connect, when yin and yang harmonize, the myriad things are born. When heaven and earth are harmonious and at peace, when spirit and clarity intermingle and descend—this is not a matter of intention. The four seasons cannot but follow their course, and the myriad things cannot but be born.

The Dao conceals purity within, harbors spirit in the heart, abides in stillness and tranquility, delights in harmony within the breast. Vast and formless, silent and soundless—this is how the sage embraces heaven’s heart, bestows virtue, and nurtures the Dao. Inwardly, spirit is stored; outwardly, no trace of beings appears. Without omen or sign, how could there be form or sound?

Government offices are as if empty of affairs; the court is as if empty of people. There are no harsh policies, no flatterers, no recluses, no idle folk. The court is filled with loyal and steadfast men, the wilderness holds no hidden worthies. There are no corvée labors, no unjust punishments; the people are employed in season, laws are applied without excess.

Under heaven, none do not look up to the ruler’s virtue, emulate the sovereign’s intent. Even distant lands and foreign customs, none do not come through repeated translation. The ruler possesses the Dao, and the people rely on his virtue. His influence extends to the eight directions, flowing even to alien customs. It is not that he visits every household in person—he merely extends his sincere heart to all under heaven. Thus, though distant peoples and foreign customs come to submit, it is not that the ruler visits each home himself; rather, his sincere heart issues forth, and distant peoples naturally arrive.

Thus, rewarding the good and punishing the violent is proper governance, but what enables it to be carried out is purity and sincerity. Though commands may be clear, they cannot act alone—they must await purity and sincerity. Purity is clarity; sincerity is trust. Without clarity and trust, none can reward the good and punish the evil.

Therefore, when the Dao is universally applied yet the people do not follow, it is because purity and sincerity have not reached them. As when Yu attacked the Miao, they did not submit, and he withdrew—only when he danced with shields and feathers did the Miao come to terms. This was the power of purity and sincerity.

Laozi said: Heaven establishes the sun’s brightness, arrays the stars, extends the four seasons, regulates yin and yang. By day it exposes things, by night it lets them rest; the wind dries them, rain and dew moisten them. In generating things, none see how they are nourished, yet the myriad things grow. In destroying things, none see how they perish, yet the myriad things die—this is called spirit and clarity. The Dao of heaven operates in hiddenness; it is difficult to express in words.

When things are born, it is their time, and they cannot but be born. When things die, it is their time, and they cannot but die. Thus, the living align with life, the dead align with death. Therefore, the living do not thank heaven, the dead do not resent the Dao—it is simply natural. This is what is meant by spirit and clarity.

Thus, the sage emulates this. When fortune arises, none see how it begins; when misfortune is removed, none see its cause. It cannot be traced, yet it is not false. Above, it was said that heaven follows the Dao; here, it is said that the sage follows heaven. Heaven’s life and death correspond to the ruler’s rewards and punishments. "Fortune arising" refers to employing the worthy; "misfortune removed" refers to eliminating the evil. The evil cannot but be punished; the worthy cannot but be advanced. Thus, the worthy advance of themselves, not because I advance them; the violent are punished of themselves, not because I punish them. Therefore, fortune does not arise from me, nor does misfortune originate from me. None know its source; none see its form.

Daily reckoning seems insufficient, but yearly reckoning shows surplus. The sage does not scheme over trifles; daily use may seem inadequate, but yearly accounting shows abundance. Silent and soundless, a single word stirs all under heaven—this is how heaven’s heart moves and transforms.

When the sage is still, all under heaven is silent. When he moves, the myriad things return to him. Thus, Gaozong did not speak for three years, yet when he spoke, his words were revered. Such was the case.

Thus, purity and sincerity take form within, moving heaven. Auspicious stars appear, yellow dragons descend, phoenixes arrive, sweet springs flow, fine grains grow. Rivers do not overflow, seas do not surge—this is how the sage embodies the Dao and nurtures beings. Only virtue moves heaven. Issuing from the heart, it responds above to heaven. Thus, dragons and phoenixes soar and gather; rivers and seas become clear and still. Without pure sincerity, how could this be achieved?

To defy heaven and harm beings brings solar and lunar eclipses, wandering stars, seasons out of joint, days darkened and nights lit, mountains collapsing and rivers drying, winter thunder and summer frost. Heaven and man communicate thus. Above, it was shown how heaven responds with auspicious omens; here, it is shown how defiance brings calamity and disaster.

Thus, know that misfortune and fortune have no fixed gate—they are summoned by man. Heaven and man communicate; qi and kindred types resonate—this cannot be mistaken. Therefore, when a state is about to perish, celestial signs change, customs grow chaotic, rainbows appear. All things are interconnected; pure qi presses upon one another. When perverse qi prevails, calamities transform beings, responding with misfortune.

Thus, the sage examines his own person and understands the myriad kinds. Diligent and cautious, he dares not be negligent. He would rather align above with heaven’s heart to pacify the black-haired people than dare to be remiss. Therefore, matters of spirit and clarity cannot be achieved by cleverness or force. Spirit and clarity are upright—how could they tolerate deceit and falsity?

Only with utmost sincerity can there be response—how could force ever penetrate? Thus, the great person’s virtue merges with heaven and earth, his clarity merges with sun and moon, his numinosity merges with ghosts and spirits, his trustworthiness merges with the four seasons. Only the supreme sage can embody the perfect Dao and align with heaven’s heart; thus, his power leaves nothing unencompassed, his illumination leaves nothing unillumined, his numinosity responds without emptiness, his trustworthiness never transgresses the proper time. One who can attain this may be called great indeed.

He embraces heaven’s heart, holds earth’s qi, grasps the balanced and contains harmony. When heart and qi communicate, heaven and earth unite in peace—how could one who does not embody balance and harmony ever reach such a state? Without descending the hall, he travels the four seas—this is the work of spiritual transformation. Changing taboos and customs, the people are transformed toward goodness as if it arose from themselves—this is the power of spiritual transformation.

The sage does not alter himself for high or low, nor change his feelings for barbarian or Chinese. Thus, without descending the hall, he transforms diverse customs; without extending his spirit, envoys from distant lands arrive. His virtue extends to others as if it arose from themselves.

Laozi said: "For the person who follows the Dao, preserving nature and safeguarding authenticity, nothing harms his person. One who comprehends the Dao’s essence and aligns with heaven’s principle remains unharmed by things and uninjured in himself. When pressed by urgent peril, his essence communicates with heaven. Sincerity reaches its utmost without deviation."

Should one never depart from their fundamental source, what could they not accomplish? Death and life share the same domain, and none can coerce or oppress them. Never departing from their source means the mind merges with the Dao, the body equalizes with transformations—where could they not go, what could they not achieve? Death and life are already dissolved; how could they be coerced or oppressed?

Moreover, to govern heaven and earth, to encompass the myriad things, to return to the workings of creation, and to contain perfect harmony—this is to have never died. The Dao models itself on heaven and earth, embraces yin and exhales yang, distributes the five agents, and envelops the ten thousand kinds. Alone, it operates above the potter’s wheel of creation, circulating beyond the bounds of transformation—it has never been born, so who could speak of its death?

Sincerity takes form within and outwardly resonates in the hearts of others—this is the untransmitted Dao. This speaks of nurturing sincerity within and externally moving others; can it be transmitted? When the sage resides above, embracing the Dao without speaking, his beneficence extends to the myriad people. Thus, the teaching without words is vast indeed.

When ruler and minister diverge in heart, deceit and treachery manifest in heaven, and the correspondence of spirit and qi is evident—this is called the eloquence of the wordless, the Dao of the unspoken. The supreme Dao is without speech; its mysterious workings do not dominate. Therefore, when ruler and minister preserve one another, chanting and extolling virtue, it reaches heaven above and communicates in secret with the spirits. The eloquence of the wordless, the Dao of the unspoken—these are what they attain.

To summon the distant, let there be non-action; to draw near, let speech be without affairs. The height and remoteness of heaven can only be moved by non-action to respond, and by non-affairs to be made close. Only those who walk in the night can attain this—walking in the night means diligent practice, like traveling at night, not yet reaching the destination, yet accompanying the journey without ceasing. Thus, the spirit is inwardly aroused and ascends to heaven.

Therefore, dismiss the galloping horse to manure the fields—"dismiss" means to cease. The "horse" is the heart. The heart, like a runaway horse, is difficult to control. People all gallop after their hearts, chasing distant fame and profit to glorify themselves. I, however, do not act thus: I cease the galloping of my heart, preserving emptiness and stillness to nourish my person.

When the tracks of chariots do not reach beyond distant lands, this is called "sitting in motion and sinking into obscurity." To arrive without traveling is called "sitting in motion"; to remain hidden without emerging is called "sinking into obscurity." The Way of heaven is impartial in approach and departure; the capable have abundance, the inept fall short. The Way of heaven is impartial: those with virtue it approaches, those without it departs.

Observe how choosing this and abandoning that involves partiality, yet when forsaking evil and embracing good, the principle aligns with nature. Without desire, there is abundance; with desire, there is insufficiency. Following it brings benefit; opposing it brings misfortune. Only through impartiality and non-action is there neither benefit nor merit.

Thus, those who govern with cunning find it difficult to maintain the state—this was already explained in the previous section. Only those who harmonize with the great harmony and uphold natural responsiveness can possess it. Only by preserving the great harmony and naturally responding can one attain it.

Laozi said: The Dao and virtue are like rawhide and leather—distance makes them seem near, closeness makes them seem far. Scrutiny finds nothing, yet investigation is not in vain. Rawhide and leather form a drum: strike it, and it responds. The Dao and virtue sustain the person: employ them, and they function. The resonance is inexhaustible, the spiritual transformation boundless. Thus, examination finds nothing, yet investigation is not in vain.

Therefore, the sage is like a mirror: neither advancing nor retreating, responding without concealing. The myriad things do not harm him; his heart is like a mirror, reflecting all without omission. He does not seek to illuminate by approaching things but constantly reflects and responds to them. No image escapes; what harm could come from encounters?

What is gained is thereby lost; what is lost is thereby gained. Gain and loss reveal insubstantiality; without gain or loss, there is true unity. Thus, one who penetrates the great harmony is dim as if drunk, sweetly reclining and roaming within it—never having departed from their source, this is called great penetration. Embracing the Dao and containing harmony, forgetting form and relinquishing burdens, like drinking fine wine, delighting in its midst, merging indistinguishably—this is the great Dao. This is the use of non-use to accomplish its function. This is awakening to the Dao through non-birth, like forgetting form through drunkenness.

Laozi said: In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor governed the world by harmonizing the movements of the sun and moon, regulating the qi of yin and yang, moderating the measures of the four seasons, rectifying the calculations of pitch pipes and calendars, distinguishing male and female, clarifying superior and inferior, ensuring the strong did not oppress the weak, and the many did not tyrannize the few. The people preserved their lives without premature death; the years were abundant without famine. The hundred officials were upright and impartial; superiors and inferiors were harmonious without blame. Laws and commands were clear and not obscure; assistants were just and not obsequious. Farmers yielded boundaries; roads were free of lost items; markets did not engage in speculative pricing. Thus, at that time, the sun, moon, and stars did not deviate from their courses; wind and rain came in season; the five grains flourished; phoenixes soared in the courtyards, and qilin roamed the outskirts. Such was the Yellow Emperor’s governance of the world through the Dao, and the transformation through virtue.

Fuxi ruled the world resting his head on stone and sleeping on ropes, killing in autumn and executing in winter, bearing the square earth and embracing the round heaven, embraced by yin and yang. Where stagnation and blockage did not flow, the qi of obstructed principles and perverse things that harmed the people and accumulated excessively were cut off. His people were like unlearned children, not knowing east from west, their vision dim, their steps faltering, yet content and self-assured, unaware of their drifting, floating without knowing their origin, nurturing themselves without knowing where to go.

At that time, birds, beasts, insects, and snakes all sheathed their claws and fangs, concealed their stings and poisons. Though they harbored the nature of venom and sting, they had no intent to harm—such was the reach of supreme virtue.

At the time of the Yellow Emperor, the essential subtleties remained obscure beneath the Great Ancestor, yet his achievements went uncelebrated, his name unproclaimed. Concealing the Way of the True Person, he followed the inherent constancy of heaven and earth. What, then, of the Dao and its virtue? When the upper reaches are penetrated, cunning and artifice vanish.

The Great Ancestor preceded the Yellow Emperor. His people were unadorned, their nature untamed. Though he accomplished works, he claimed no virtue; though he bore a name, he did not exalt it. Thus it is said: he concealed the Way of the True Person, severed the clamor of superficial wisdom, and accorded with the natural communion of heaven and earth.

Laozi said: If heaven is unsettled, the sun and moon have nothing to bear them; if earth is unsettled, grasses and trees have nowhere to stand; if the self is not at peace, right and wrong take no shape. When the Three Powers are not at peace, the myriad things lose their place. If one does not cultivate single-minded devotion, turning inward to listen and reflect, then the True Person remains unseen, and true wisdom does not arise.

Thus, only with the True Person does true wisdom emerge. If what one holds is not illuminated, how can one know whether what I call knowledge is not ignorance? If what one preserves is not clear, how can one know the Dao?

This is to know that the knower does not fail to know the Dao.

Accumulating kindness and valuing wealth, bringing joy to the myriad people so that they delight in life—this is *ren* (benevolence). Achieving great deeds, making one’s illustrious name known, embodying the proper relationship between ruler and minister, rectifying the hierarchy of high and low, clarifying the distinctions of near and far, preserving imperiled states, continuing severed lineages, and establishing heirs where none exist—this is *yi* (righteousness). Through *ren* one establishes things, and through *yi* one preserves sincerity; thus, none fail to cherish it, and no affair goes unaccomplished. This is the Way of kings and hegemons in governing the world.

Closing the nine apertures, concealing one’s will and intentions, relinquishing cleverness and insight, returning to non-discernment, wandering in boundless vagueness beyond the dust and grime, roaming freely in the realm of non-action, inhaling yin and exhaling yang to harmonize with the myriad things—this is *de* (virtue/power). Inwardly obscure yet outwardly compliant, concealing essence to nurture the true, acting without contrivance while remaining untouched by external defilements—thus, the Dao disperses and becomes *de*, and *de* overflows into *ren* and *yi*. Yet once *ren* and *yi* are established, the Dao and *de* are abandoned. What was once pure essence scatters, leaving only dregs.

Laozi said: When the spirit scatters, words become florid; when *de* dissipates, conduct becomes false. When the utmost essence is obscured within, yet words and actions are scrutinized without, one cannot avoid being enslaved by things. When inner essence overflows, external embellishments arise; when the mind is ensnared by affairs, how can the body escape harm? Essence may be exhausted, but actions know no end; if what one preserves is unstable, one becomes externally entangled in worldly customs. If inner preservation is unsteady, one reaches a dead end and sinks into mire; if external pursuits never cease, one is perpetually tormented by storms and waves. Therefore, the sage cultivates the arts of the Dao within and does not outwardly adorn himself with *ren* and *yi*. He understands the proper use of the nine apertures and four limbs, yet roams in the harmony of spirit—this is the sage’s wandering.

The sage inwardly guards the true essence while outwardly responding to things as they are; thus, he attains the harmony of spirit and roams in the boundless. Laozi said: As for the sage’s wandering, he moves in perfect emptiness, his mind roams in the great void, gallops beyond the four directions, acts without gateways, listens without sound, and sees without form. Unconstrained by the world, unbound by custom—moving in perfect emptiness, there is nothing he does not penetrate; roaming in the great void, there is nothing he does not possess. What gate or door could confine him? How could sight or hearing be clouded? Thus, what the sage employs to move the world is not what the True Person surpasses, and what the worthy use to correct世俗 is not what the sage observes. The traces of the True and the sagely differ, their achievements and undertakings diverge—like ancestral sacrifices and kitchen duties, each attends to their proper place.

Those bound by世俗 must manifest their form and dissipate their spirit, and thus cannot escape entanglement. None who dwell in glory and prominence avoid enslavement of the spirit; having received their emoluments, they must also bear their burdens. If I can be fettered, it is because my fate lies beyond myself. Once shackled, my fate is no longer mine.

Laozi said: When the ruler’s thoughts do not scatter in his breast, nor his wisdom extend beyond the four domains; when he cherishes a heart of benevolence and sincerity, sweet rains fall in season, the five grains flourish, spring brings growth, summer brings maturity, autumn brings harvest, winter brings storage, and monthly reviews and seasonal assessments culminate in annual tribute—such is the ruler with the Dao. He does not exhaust his spirit in deliberation nor flaunt his wisdom and ability, yet distant lands are drawn to him. Thus, he aligns above with the heart of heaven and below with the proper order of things, and the myriad people offer their allegiance, their tribute unceasing. He nurtures the people with impartiality, his majesty is awe-inspiring yet not harsh, his laws are few and punishments lenient. Transformation occurs as if by spirit, laws are broad and penalties mild, prisons stand empty, the world shares a single custom, and none harbor treacherous hearts—this is the sage’s grace.

Impartial yet not selfish, majestic yet not fierce, laws concise and punishments mild, people follow his transformation—this may be called the utmost spirit. Thus, all directions are united, diverse customs follow a single path—this is the sage’s grace in governing the world. If those above covet without measure, those below will vie for merit without restraint; the people grow impoverished and distressed, disputes arise, toil yields no fruit, cunning and deceit sprout, and bandits and thieves proliferate. Above and below resent one another, decrees go unheeded. The aforementioned conditions are not how the sage governs the world. To rule thus is to court ruin without delay.

When water is turbid, fish gasp; when governance is harsh, the people rebel. When those above are full of desires, those below are full of deceit; when those above are restless, those below are unsettled; when those above make many demands, those below contend with one another. To neglect the root and seek remedy at the branches is no different from digging a channel to stop water or carrying firewood to extinguish a fire. Grasping the root to govern the branches yields effortless success and a well-ordered world; clinging to the branches to seek the root brings labor to the self and chaos to the world—like trying to stop overflowing water by digging channels or quell a raging fire by adding fuel, it cannot be saved.

The sage’s affairs are few yet well-ordered, his demands are few yet sufficient. Without acting, he is benevolent; without speaking, he is trusted; without seeking, he obtains; without striving, he accomplishes. Embracing the natural, preserving the utmost true, holding to the Dao and extending sincerity, the world follows him as echo follows sound, as shadow follows form—what he cultivates is the root. The principle of the utmost sage lies in simplicity and ease, and thus the world reveres him, responding like echo to sound, like shadow to form—none fail to answer.

Laozi said: When the spirit scatters outward and wisdom and deliberation dissipate within, one cannot govern. When the uses of form and spirit extend too far, what is neglected lies close at hand. Pursuing what is not one’s portion and indulging without restraint injures the spirit within and abandons the body without. Thus, one who does not step beyond the door yet knows the world, who does not peer through the window yet knows the Way of heaven— the farther he ventures, the less he knows. This speaks of sincerity issuing from within and spirit and qi moving heaven.

Grasping the essentials to observe the world, the sentiments of people can be discerned. Holding the jade pivot to observe the great movements, the Way of heaven can be illuminated. When sincere words issue from within, essence and qi respond to heaven. What one guards is near, yet what one illuminates is distant; the more one busies oneself, the less one knows.

Laozi said: The yang of winter’s sun, the yin of summer’s shade—things turn to them without being driven to excess. This is the spontaneous arrival of utmost refinement, unsummoned yet come, departing without going. In the profound and obscure, though one knows not how it is done, success is achieved of itself.

The yang of winter’s sun—those who are cold draw near. The yin of summer’s shade—those who are scorched find relief. Thus the sage governs the world: yin and yang are without sentiment, and the sage too is without sentiment. Things embrace of themselves, people return of themselves. Thus they come without being summoned, depart without being sent away.

To await the eye before seeing, to await speech before issuing commands—governance becomes difficult. Gaoyao was mute yet served as Grand Judge, and the world knew no cruel punishments—what need was there for words? Shikuang was blind yet served as Grand Minister, and the state of Jin knew no disorder—what need was there for sight? The command that requires no speech, the vision that requires no seeing—this is how the sage becomes a teacher.

To transform without speaking, so that below there are no cruel punishments—why trouble with words? To govern without seeing, so that Jin knows no disorder—what need is there for sight? Thus, without awaiting the eye to see, without needing speech to command—this is how the sage becomes a teacher.

The people’s transformation by their superior does not follow his words but follows his conduct. In high antiquity, one acted without speaking; in later ages, one speaks without acting. Thus when a ruler favors valor, though he does not incite strife, the state will face many crises, and gradually there will arise the chaos of robbery and murder. When a ruler favors beauty, though he does not encourage licentious talk, the state will fall into darkness and disorder, and over time there will come the calamity of debauchery and ruin.

The people’s transformation by their superior is like water flowing downward. One must block the source and be vigilant in small matters. Thus Duke Zhuang of Qin suffered the disaster of forced abdication, and Jie of Xia brought about the chaos of Daji. Therefore the sage refines sincerity within and clarifies likes and dislikes without. His words match his feelings, his decrees make his intent clear. Within, there is no partiality; without, there is no favoritism or aversion. Words issue and echoes respond; commands go forth and the wind carries them.

Thus punishments are not enough to shift customs, executions are not enough to suppress villainy. One may transform through virtue, but it is difficult to control through penalties. Only spiritual transformation is precious. Utmost refinement is spirit. Where refinement moves, it is like the qi of spring giving life or the qi of autumn bringing death. In life, it is warm as spring things receiving their growth. In death, it is solemn as autumn things reaching their end.

Thus in life there is no seeking of reward, in death no harboring of resentment. Life and death come from its being without intent. Therefore the noble person is like an archer: here, a hair’s breadth; there, a span’s mark. Thus one who governs others must be cautious in how he influences them.

Therefore the noble person governing others is like an archer: when the arrow is loosed, he aims for the target, and when it reaches the butt, he measures the span’s mark. A deviation of a hair’s breadth is as distant as heaven from earth.

Laozi said: To hang laws and set rewards yet fail to shift customs and change habits is because sincerity is not embraced. Laws cannot restrain the people; only utmost virtue can transform customs. Thus by listening to their music one knows their customs; by observing their music one knows their manners; by seeing their manners one knows their transformation.

Examine the sound to know the music, examine the music to know the governance, observe the governance to know the customs, observe the customs to know the transformation. One who embraces truth and offers sincerity moves heaven and earth, and spirits transcend beyond the four directions. Commands are obeyed and prohibitions observed. Sincerity penetrates the Way and conveys its intent. Though not a word is spoken, the myriad people of the world, birds and beasts, ghosts and spirits, all change with him.

Thus the sage’s governance of the world: the people follow his transformation as if rolling a ball. To forbid villainy and error is like halting a square object. Therefore, with virtue that does not rely on force, with teachings that require no words, even birds and beasts, spirits and ghosts, have none who are not pleased and submissive—how much more so for people?

Thus the highest is spiritual transformation, returning to spontaneity. Next is enabling people not to do wrong, establishing laws to regulate. The lowest is rewarding the worthy and punishing the violent. When the Way and virtue are abandoned, rewards and punishments begin. When the path to advancing the worthy is opened, the unworthy also find places. When their positions are lost, the seeds of violence arise, and even the worthy may suffer execution.

Thus one knows that without clear laws, those who uphold them become excessive; without an even balance, those who use it become weak.

Laozi said: The great Way is non-action. Non-action is non-possession. One who does not possess does not abide. One who does not abide dwells in formlessness. One who is formless does not move. One who does not move does not speak. One who does not speak is still and without sound or form. Without sound or form, it cannot be seen when looked at, cannot be heard when listened to. This is called the subtle and wondrous, the utmost spirit. Continuous as if existing—this is called the root of heaven and earth.

Non-action is acting without reliance, thus it is called non-action. No speech is speaking without pride, thus it is called no sound. Without form, what is there to hear? Without color, what is there to see? This may be called spiritually subtle. Standing alone without change, continuous and ever-present—it is the root of heaven and earth.

The Way is without form or sound, thus the sage forcibly gives it form, using a single word to name the Way of heaven and earth. This speaks of grasping the essentials of the Way. The great takes the small as its root, the many take the few as their beginning. Being arises from non-being, the many arise from the one.

Tracing back to the origin returns to formlessness; pursuing the branches leads to confusion by multiplicity. Thus knowing to return takes non-being as its foundation; sensing multiplicity seeks the one as its master.

The Son of Heaven takes heaven and earth as his standard—this speaks of their vastness. He takes the myriad things as his resources—there is nothing he does not possess. His merit and virtue are utmost, his power and name are most noble. The beauty of these two virtues matches heaven and earth. Thus he cannot but follow the great Way as the mother of the world.

From the honor of the four seas to matching heaven and earth—how could he not follow it to avoid disorder? This is the heavenly constant.

Laozi said: Relieving poverty and aiding the urgent brings forth fame and profit, yet one should not practice petty kindness. Removing harm is where merit is accomplished. Not claiming merit as one’s own—this is goodness.

When the world knows no disasters or harms, even sages have no virtue to apply; when superiors and inferiors are in harmony, even the worthy have no merit to establish. When disasters arise, sages pacify them; when a state falls into calamity and chaos, the worthy settle it. Yet if disasters do not arise and chaos does not stir, even sages have no throne from which to act as sages, and even the worthy have no ground on which to establish merit.

Thus the governance of the perfected person embraces virtue and holds to the Dao, extending sincerity and delighting in bestowal. With boundless wisdom, they rest in silence and do not speak, and none in the world know the value of their non-speaking. They drum their bellies and strike the earth, unaware of the emperor’s power.

Thus the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. The Dao without name is the utmost Dao; the Dao with name is the name of the world. Therefore, the Dao that can be spoken is not the Dao; the name that can be named is not the name.

That which is inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved into metal and stone, and transmitted to others—all these are but its coarse aspects, flowery and overly adorned. The Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings followed different affairs yet shared the same heart, took different paths yet reached the same destination. Though their words differed and their governance varied with the times, their return to the Dao was one.

Scholars of the latter age do not know that the Dao is embodied in unity, that virtue gathers in essentials. They seize upon the immediacy of accomplished matters, kneel and sit to discourse upon them—though learned and widely informed, they cannot escape disorder. Scholars of today do not trace back to the root, do not embody the essentials, do not investigate the principle, but instead follow the traces, striving for broad knowledge, only adding to the chaos.

Laozi said: The essence of the heart can work spiritual transformations but cannot be spoken of as the Dao. Its spiritual transformations cannot be explained as non-Dao. The sage does not descend from his seat yet rectifies the world, his care surpassing even a shout. A shout can be heard, but only by a few; when a decree is issued, the whole world submits.

Thus when words are the same, trust lies before the words; when commands are the same, sincerity lies beyond the command. Sharing the people’s sorrows, words reach trust, for trust is established beforehand—none dare not respond. Sharing the people’s benefits, commands are carried out with sincerity, for sincerity arises externally—none dare disobey.

When the sage is above, the people are transformed as if by spirit, for sentiment precedes them. Grasping their intent, responses come as if by spirit. If one acts above yet receives no response below, it is because sentiment and decree diverge. The hungry seek food, the cold long for fur. If one gives fur to the hungry and food to the cold, the decree is already contrary—how can the people’s sentiment attach to it?

A three-month-old infant knows not of benefit or harm, yet the loving mother’s care grows ever more earnest—this is sentiment. The heart of a newborn child does not speak of hunger or fullness, yet the compassionate mother observes its signs, discerns its dryness or dampness, and nurtures it with kindness. If the ruler of men cherishes the hundred clans as he loves a newborn child, what worry is there that the world will not be governed, that the four seas will not be at peace?

Thus the use of words brings change—change in small matters. The use of non-words brings change—change in great matters. Words that speak of words are small; words that speak of no-words are great. Trusting a noble person’s words, being loyal to a noble person’s intent, loyalty and trust take shape within and move responses without—this is the transformation of the worthy and sage.

Loyalty and trust arise from the noble person’s original intent, not from forgetfulness. Thus when they take shape within and move without, even the worthy and sage cannot but follow.

Laozi said: A son’s death for his father, a minister’s death for his lord—these are not acts of seeking fame through death. The heart’s kindness is stored within, and they do not shirk from difficulty. A son dies for his father’s peril, a minister dies for his lord’s peril—not to feign virtue for the world’s praise, but because kindness covers them so deeply that they forget themselves, rushing straight into peril. Their sincerity arises from within.

The noble person’s sorrow is not for outward correctness but arises from within. One must examine their conduct.

Sorrow and distress refer to penal law. Execution and punishment are not the proper Way. They are employed only to punish evil and encourage good, as a last resort, and must not be wantonly applied. The sage feels no shame before the sun and moon; the noble do not commit wrongdoing. The noble person is cautious in solitude, meaning they do not deceive even in darkness and seclusion. To abandon what is near and seek what is distant is to invite obstruction. To neglect self-cultivation while demanding it of others is to invite blockage.

Thus when the sage is in high position, the people delight in their governance; when in low position, the people admire their intent, for their resolve never wavers from desiring to benefit others. With their resolve set on benefiting others, all people rejoice and admire them.

Laozi said: When a brave warrior lets out a single cry, the entire army retreats—such is the power of his sincerity. A single shout from the brave strikes terror into ten thousand. The worthy govern the age, and all under heaven look to them. If one sings and none respond, or offers counsel and none bear it, there must be discord within. For their principles differ from others’. One who corrects all under heaven without leaving their seat seeks the cause within themselves. When joy and sorrow are shared with the people, and likes and dislikes are aligned with them, then by examining oneself, one can transform others.

Thus where persuasion does not reach, one’s demeanor does; though it may not convey the subtlest essence, it can approximate one’s bearing. Where demeanor does not reach, subtle influence does—arising from the heart and taking form, it moves through spiritual resonance, not through outward appearance. The utmost refinement can be perceived through form, yet cannot be forced into clarity. Though form arises from the formless, the purest essence gives birth to all forms, making them manifest. One does not seek refinement, yet refinement resides within.

Laozi said: Words have their source, affairs have their root. Lose the source and root, and no matter how many skills one possesses, it is better to speak little. Take the Dao as the source and virtue as the root; depart from them, and abundance is no match for simplicity. To harm the many, Yu the craftsman would sever his own finger to demonstrate that great skill cannot be forced. True skill resides in the heart, not in the fingers—cutting off what cannot be attained. When the Dao is in the heart, clarity does not depend on grand words. To value words as if they were the Dao is to hope in vain for the Dao.

Thus the craftsman’s wisdom lies not in their ability but in knowing when to close. The craftsman—an artisan—closes with skill, for the most adept know how to seal tightly, so none can open. The unskilled rely solely on brute force, and though strong, they will inevitably fail. This illustrates the exhaustion of subtle wisdom, for strength alone is insufficient.

Laozi said: The sage’s undertakings may follow different paths, yet they converge in the same end. Though past and present differ, governance remains the same. Preservation and ruin, stability and collapse—if one’s resolve never wavers from desiring to benefit others, then the ruined are preserved, the collapsed are stabilized. Is this concern only for oneself? It is always for the benefit of others.

Thus the songs of Qin, Chu, Yan, and Wei differ in sound yet all express joy; the wails of the Nine Yi and Eight Di differ in sound yet all convey sorrow. Song is the manifestation of joy, weeping the expression of sorrow—concealed within, it emerges without, and thus the means of moving others. Sound and breath resonate, sorrow and joy summon one another. Therefore, though songs differ by nation, all share in joy; though wails vary by region, all share in grief.

The sage’s heart never ceases, day or night, from desiring to benefit others. The reach of their virtue is thus vast. By unceasingly benefiting others, their influence extends far and wide.

Laozi said: When people act without contrivance, there is governance. To act is to harm the governance of non-action. To practice non-action is to act; those who cannot act without contrivance cannot truly act. To speak of non-action is still to act; to act is to depart from the governance of non-action. Only by acting without acting is there true non-action.

When people remain silent, the spirit speaks—yet to cling to silence harms the spirit’s true nature. The spirit values silence; even the sage does not force speech. Words reveal traces, actions reveal the coarse. Only when both are unharmed can the Dao be preserved whole.

Wenzi said: A name can be forcibly established, merit can be forcibly achieved—this is the way of encouragement. Formerly, Nanrong Chu, a disciple of Laozi, felt shame that the sagely Dao was absent within himself. He traveled south to see Laozi and received a single teaching. His spirit became enlightened, and though he endured hardship and toil, fasting for ten days, he savored the Dao as if feasting on the finest delicacies. Having received a single teaching, he meditated for ten days, forgetting hunger and tasting the Dao as if enjoying a grand banquet.

Thus his wisdom illuminated all within the seas, his name endured through later generations, his intelligence and strategy spanned heaven and earth, his discernment was as keen as distinguishing autumn down. His praises and eloquent words continue unceasing to this day—this is what it means for a name to be forcibly established. The ultimate teaching, once received, dissolves all doubts like the sun’s reflection illuminating a dark room.

Thus the farmer who does not exert himself will not fill his granary; the official who does not strive will not refine their sincerity; the general and minister who do not exert themselves will not achieve great deeds; the king and lord who are indolent will leave no name for posterity. From commoners to kings and lords, none have filled their granaries or made their names illustrious without diligence and effort.

The perfected person acts in concealment, like thunder hidden away. They act in accordance with the times, establish merit through available resources, advance and retreat without difficulty, and nothing is impassable. The great person’s Dao is hidden and still—none under heaven can perceive their actions. Yet when thunder strikes, none under heaven fail to hear it. They advance without elation, retreat without shame—this is the great Dao.

The perfected person’s essence and sincerity take form within, their virtue flowing to the four directions. Seeing benefit for all under heaven, they rejoice yet do not forget the harm that may befall them, trembling as if in mourning. They welcome benefit yet fear encountering harm. One who sorrows with the people’s sorrow will have the people sorrow with their sorrow; one who rejoices with the people’s joy will have the people rejoice with their joy. Thus to sorrow with all under heaven and rejoice with all under heaven—yet fail to become king—has never been.

To sorrow with the people is to have the people sorrow with you; to rejoice with the people is to have the people rejoice with you. One who shares sorrow and joy with the people yet fails to win their allegiance has never been.

The sage’s law begins where it cannot be seen and ends where it cannot be reached. Their virtue and righteousness know no bounds, their beginning and end no limits. They dwell in unshakable ground, stand where non-action prevails. They amass from inexhaustible granaries, using without depletion; they draw from unfailing treasuries, circulating without end.

Their decrees flow like the source of a river, guiding the people to offices of no contention. When commands are issued, the people know the prohibitions; when affairs are simplified, officials have no disputes. They open doors that must be entered, secure the people in their occupations. They do not attempt what cannot be accomplished, do not seek what cannot be obtained, do not dwell where they cannot endure, do not act where they cannot recover.

The great person’s decrees bring only benefit when enacted, and what they establish endures. They do not dwell where they cannot last, do not seek what cannot be regained. The great person enacts governance that brings joy, and none fail to follow their commands. When commands are obeyed, one advances from small to great; when commands are defied, good becomes harm and success becomes failure.

In their governance and teaching, obedience turns misfortune to fortune, while defiance reduces the great to the small. The one called a true great person is inwardly strong and outwardly luminous—internally as steadfast as heaven and earth, externally as radiant as sun and moon. Heaven and earth cover and bear all, sun and moon illuminate all. To be like heaven and earth in covering and bearing, like sun and moon in illumination—this is the true great person.

The great person shows goodness to others without altering their fundamental ways, without changing their constant principles. All under heaven follow their commands as grass bends to the wind. To alter the fundamentals unsettles customs; to follow nature makes the people easy to govern. Grass bends to the wind—none dare defy it.

When governance errs in spring, Jupiter waxes and wanes, abandoning its regular path. When governance errs in summer, Mars moves in reverse. When governance errs in autumn, Venus appears where it should not, its movements erratic. When governance errs in winter, Mercury fails to appear in its proper place. When the four seasons lose their order, Saturn sways unsteadily, the sun and moon display omens, the five planets move in chaos, and comets appear. When the seasons are disordered and the five planets lose their regularity, celestial omens appear in the heavens, and disaster befalls humanity.

If spring governance is not lost, millet and grain flourish; if summer governance is not lost, rain falls in season; if autumn governance is not lost, the people prosper; if winter governance is not lost, the state enjoys peace and well-being. Thus the enlightened ruler must not lose proper governance. When the ruler loses governance, heaven sends down a hundred calamities. When the ruler upholds governance, heaven sends down a hundred blessings. The joy of one becomes the joy of ten thousand.

**The Nine Guardians**

This chapter contains nine sections, hence the title *The Nine Guardians*. Nine is the culminating number of the *Yi*. When clarity reaches its limit, change occurs, and change leads to deviation from the Dao. Those who guard it abide in stillness—like the dragon at its zenith, free from regret—and may transcend the Three Pure Realms. Those who neglect it, like a barren mare, will sink beneath the Nine Dark Abysses. Thus, one must guard the Dao and never lose constancy.

Laozi said: Before heaven and earth took form, all was dark and indistinct, merged as one, the qi and its manifestations undivided. Silent and limpid, the heavy and turbid settled as earth, the refined and subtle rose as heaven—thus were shapes and substances established. Separating, they became the four seasons: spring’s birth, summer’s growth, autumn’s harvest, winter’s storage. Dividing, they became yin and yang, and hardness and softness were set forth. Refined qi became humans, coarse qi became creatures. Their origin is one, yet their endowment differs; qi has purity and turbidity, things have refinement and coarseness. Through the interplay of hardness and softness, the myriad things are born. From this, transformations extend endlessly.

Spirit and essence derive from heaven; bones and flesh root in earth. That which derives from heaven inclines upward; that which derives from earth inclines downward. When spirit enters its gate and bones return to their root, what remains of me? Entering the gate of the boundless, returning to the root of creation, who, if not utterly sincere in their truth, can claim a self? Thus, the sage models heaven and follows earth, unbound by custom, unenticed by others. Heaven is their father, earth their mother; yin and yang their warp, the four seasons their weft. Soaring between heaven and earth, they tread the warp and weft, roaming in the realm of self-attainment, dwelling in the abode of non-action. Custom cannot bind them, the world cannot entice them.

Heaven is still and clear; earth is settled and tranquil. The myriad things that oppose them perish; those that accord with them live. Heaven has no intent regarding opposition or accord—yet humans bring upon themselves calamity and ruin. Thus, stillness and silence are the dwelling of spirit and clarity; emptiness and nothingness are the abode of the Dao. The Dao resides in quietude; spirit wanders in the utmost void.

Spirit and essence are received from heaven; bones and flesh are endowed by earth. Heaven’s qi, clear and transformative, becomes spirit; earth’s qi, heavy and congealing, becomes bones and flesh—hence the term "endowment." The Dao gives birth to the One: heaven. The One gives birth to the Two: earth. The Two give birth to the Three: humanity. The Three give birth to the myriad things. Their transformations are vast. The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, harmonized by the qi between them. All are softened and harmonized by qi.

Laozi said: Humans receive the transformations of heaven and earth and are born between them, dwelling above the myriad things. In the first month, the essence congeals. In the second, blood and vessels form, and the embryo’s shape appears. In the third, the embryo takes form, and the residence of spirit is fixed. In the fourth, the fetus develops; in the fifth, the sinews; in the sixth, the bones; in the seventh, the form is complete, and the orifices open, granting clarity. In the eighth, movement begins, and spirit descends with its numinous power. In the ninth, restlessness arises as the palaces and chambers arrange themselves to secure the essence. In the tenth, birth occurs, and the myriad images are complete.

Once the physical form is fully shaped, the five viscera divide. The liver governs the eyes, the kidneys the ears, the spleen the tongue, the lungs the nose, and the gallbladder the mouth. Here, only four viscera are mentioned—modern accounts differ, and the details remain unclear. The exterior is the surface; the interior is the core. The head is round, modeling heaven; the feet are square, resembling earth. A single human body encompasses the myriad images—it must not be treated lightly.

Heaven has four seasons, five phases, nine luminaries, and three hundred sixty days; humans have four limbs, five viscera, nine orifices, and three hundred sixty joints. Heaven has wind, rain, cold, and heat; humans have taking and giving, joy and anger. The gallbladder corresponds to clouds, the lungs to qi, the spleen to wind, the kidneys to rain, and the liver to thunder. Humans resemble heaven and earth, with the heart as their master.

The heart governs the body, overseeing the five viscera, six bowels, four limbs, and nine orifices. Above, it connects to heaven; below, it responds to earth; in between, it harmonizes with the myriad things. This is what is called "spirit." The common people use it daily yet do not know it; those who understand this Dao are few.

The ears and eyes are the sun and moon; blood and qi are wind and rain. When the sun and moon lose their course, they dim and eclipse; when wind and rain are untimely, they destroy and bring disaster. Heaven has sun and moon, which must not be dim; wind and rain, which must be regulated. When they are untimely or unregulated, disaster follows. Humans have ears and eyes, which must be clear; blood and vessels, which must be balanced. When they are disharmonious or unbalanced, illness arises.

When the five stars lose their course, the states and regions suffer their misfortune. Where the five stars trespass, the corresponding lands endure calamity. When the five viscera are afflicted by evil, the whole body falls ill. The Dao of heaven and earth is vast and great, yet it still regulates its brilliance and cherishes its spirit and clarity. How can human ears and eyes endure constant stimulation without rest, or spirit and essence gallop without exhaustion?

Heaven and earth, though vast, regulate the four seasons and harmonize the five planets, protecting their spirit and clarity. How much more so for humans, who employ their ears and eyes and let their hearts and thoughts race—can they preserve their nature and spirit? Thus, the sage guards the inner and does not lose the outer, preserving spirit within and protecting the physical form without.

Blood and qi are humanity’s splendor; the five viscera are humanity’s essence. When blood and qi focus inward and do not stray outward, the chest and abdomen are full, and desires diminish. Observing the surface reveals the interior; seeing the root reveals the branch. When desires arise within, splendor fades without; when essence and qi harmonize within, the flesh and skin flourish without.

When desires are few, the ears and eyes are clear, and hearing and sight are keen—this is called "clarity." Clarity leaves nothing unperceived; brightness leaves nothing unilluminated. All arise from restraining passions and cutting off desires. When the five viscera remain aligned with the heart and do not stray, qi and intent prevail, and conduct is not perverse. When spirit is abundant and qi does not scatter, hearing leaves nothing unheard, sight leaves nothing unseen, and nothing is left unaccomplished.

By rightly settling the heart, the five viscera remain free from evil, wayward qi disperses, and the function of spirit and essence becomes bright. Nothing subtle is left unilluminated, nothing hidden is left unexamined, no affair is left unfinished, and no task is left unaccomplished.

Troubles and misfortunes have no means to enter, and wayward qi cannot invade. In movement and action, constancy in rectitude ensures calamities vanish of themselves. When inner essence does not dissipate, external evils cannot penetrate. Thus, those who seek much gain little, and those who perceive broadly know narrowly. To seek abundance from scarcity, to infer the great from the small—this is clarity.

The orifices are the doors and windows of spirit; blood and qi are the messengers and sentinels of the five viscera. Open the doors and windows, and spirit becomes luminous, its dark mirror bright; unobstruct the messengers, and the five viscera flow freely, free from disorder. When ears and eyes are indulgent in sounds and sights, the five viscera tremble and cannot settle, blood and qi surge and do not rest, spirit gallops and does not abide. Though blessings and misfortunes arrive like mountains, there is no means to perceive them.

Bewildered by sounds and sights, one enslaves the spirit, forgetting both self and other. Like still water, where even a hair’s breadth is visible, when one is obscured, even mountain-like calamities go unseen. Thus, the sage cherishes without transgressing; though desires may flow, they are ever restrained and regulated, never seeking what lies beyond. If the sage ensures ears and eyes are keen and profoundly penetrating, free from allure and longing, intent and qi unerring in clarity, with few desires, the five viscera find peace. Spirit guards within the form without straying, and one may observe beyond past ages, within future affairs, and between fortune and misfortune—all becomes fully visible.

The sage knows that desires obscure and obstruct clarity, so they unify heart and qi to halt disorder, guard spirit without transgression, and thus the truths of inner and outer become visible, the omens of fortune and misfortune naturally clear. Therefore, the farther one strays, the less one knows. Chasing distant things, prizing the near and valuing the self—what is discarded is great, what is gained is small. This speaks to spirit: it must not be allowed to stray outward. The five colors confuse the eyes, rendering them unclear; the five tones enter the ears, dulling their acuity; the five flavors disorder the mouth, causing sores and decay.

External desires bring internal harm. Pursuits and aversions disturb the heart, making conduct reckless. Desires cause qi to overflow, likes and dislikes exhaust the essence. If not swiftly abandoned, aspiration and qi daily diminish. When essence and qi leak away, form and spirit daily fade. The reason people cannot fulfill their natural lifespan is their excessive indulgence in life. "Excessive indulgence" means insatiable craving, seeking only gratification—truly, self-estrangement.

Only those who do not treat life as paramount attain longevity. Not treating life as paramount means not indulging excessively; not indulging excessively means not dwelling in places of certain death. Heaven and earth move and interpenetrate; the myriad things converge as one. To know the One is to know all; not to know the One is to know nothing. From heaven and earth to the myriad things, endless cycles all ride upon the One, giving rise to the ten thousand kinds. Though diverse, they share a root in the One. Thus, to know the myriad things as One is to comprehend all principles; not to know them as One is to fail in every encounter.

I dwell in the world as one thing among things—yet things are also things. How can things be distinguished from one another? This reveals the profound unity of self and other, where preferences and aversions have no ground. Thus, I dwell in the world as but one thing among the world’s things. Being of the same kind, how can they be distinguished? When self and other are both forgotten, right and wrong dissolve, and the blade glides through emptiness—this is the great mastery of preserving the true.

Desire for life cannot be served; aversion to death cannot be refused. Desires cannot be indulged, affairs cannot be multiplied. The lowly cannot be despised, nor the noble rejoiced in. Nobility and baseness find their proper place—where then lie likes and dislikes? Follow one’s endowment and find tranquility, daring not to exceed. Not exceeding, one attains the utmost joy.

This passage summarizes the Nine Guardians as the utmost sincerity for governing the state and cultivating the self. Those who turn toward the Dao should carefully ponder its essence.

**The Nine Guardians of Unity**
Laozi said: The so-called sage accords with the times and finds peace in their position, delights in their work amid the age. What others find uneasy, they make supremely peaceful; what others find joyless, they make supremely joyful. Grief and joy are deviations of virtue; likes and dislikes are burdens of the heart; pleasure and anger are transgressions of the Dao. The common person has them; the Daoist does not. In life, they follow the movement of heaven; in death, they transform with things. Life is not mine to possess—thus it is called "heaven’s movement." Death is not my end—thus it is called "transformation with things."

At rest, they unite with yin in virtue; in motion, they harmonize with yang in its current—this is movement and stillness without losing their rectitude. The heart is the life of the form; spirit is the treasure of the heart. Spirit is the abode of the heart, what people hold most precious. When the form labors without rest, it withers; when essence is used without cease, it depletes. Thus, the sage honors this and dares not transgress. The form is the dwelling of spirit; essence is the numen of qi. They depend on one another to preside; if they part, death follows. The sage values them and dares not use them lightly.

Responding to being with non-being, one must exhaust its principles; receiving the full with emptiness, one must fathom its limits. The myriad things arise from nothing, and nothing is not possessed. Heaven and earth receive with emptiness, and nothing is not contained. Serene, joyful, empty, and still, one fulfills their mandate. Preserving emptiness and stillness, one penetrates life and death. Nothing is estranged, nothing is favored. In nobility, one is not favored; in baseness, one is not estranged. Embracing virtue and kindling harmony, one accords with heaven, joins with the Dao as their boundary, and neighbors with virtue. They do not initiate fortune, nor precede calamity. Death and life bring no change to them—thus they are called "utterly spirit-like."

Accordant with the Dao and virtue, equal in death and life, fortune cannot aid them, nor calamity overthrow them. If not utterly spirit-like, how could one be thus?

The spirit-like attains all it seeks and accomplishes all it undertakes. Able to align with the Dao of heaven and earth, to unite in virtue with the numinous, whatever it seeks is attained, whatever it does is accomplished—this may be called "utterly spirit-like." Abiding in nothingness, Laozi said: "Lightening the world, the spirit remains unburdened; refining the myriad things, the mind is not deluded. If one does not treat the world as a thief of the myriad things, how can the spirit be burdened? If one is not a thief of the myriad things, how can the mind be deceived?"

Equalizing life and death, the will is not cowed; harmonizing with transformation, clarity is not dazzled. Knowing that life and death are but provisional names, one is not terrified; recognizing that transformation is but empty illusion, one is not startled. The perfected person leans upon an unshakable pillar, walks an unbounded path—the unshakable pillar is the Dao, the unbounded path is virtue. With the Dao as their pillar, they do not topple; with virtue as their path, all destinations are fitting.

Drawing from an inexhaustible storehouse, the spirit’s use is limitless. Learning from an undying teacher, their foundation is non-arising. There is nowhere they do not succeed, nothing they do not penetrate. In bending and stretching, bowing and rising, they embrace their mandate without confusion, navigating fortune and misfortune with ease. Profit and harm cannot trouble their heart; life and death do not press upon them—how could profit and harm weigh upon their mind?

Those who uphold righteousness may be pressed by benevolence but cannot be coerced by force; those who preserve righteousness may be exhorted by the Way of benevolence but cannot be threatened by military might. They may be guided by righteousness but cannot be lured by profit—valuing righteousness, they disdain profit. The noble person dies for righteousness and cannot be detained by wealth or honor; they would rather tread the path of righteousness unto death than live in ignoble prosperity. Those who act for righteousness cannot be frightened by death, for they die for righteousness and forget life—how much more so for those who practice non-action?

The non-acting are without burden; the unburdened take the world as a shadow pillar—a shadow pillar is emptiness and nothingness. Devoid of form and substance, where can burdens cling? If those who preserve righteousness cannot be threatened by force, how much less can those who embody the Dao be frightened by death?

Gazing upward at the ranks of the perfected, deeply tracing the intent of the Dao and virtue, and examining below the conduct of the vulgar world, one finds ample cause for advancement. To advance is to progress. Observing the past and present, embracing the Dao and guarding virtue, deeply understanding the purport—this is sufficient for cultivation.

Those who do not treat the world as their own are like striking a drum to silence it. The rulers of high antiquity, without exception, took the world as their own, not contemplating the ultimate Dao, acting with blatant self-interest—they were like one who beats a drum seeking silence, yet no response comes.

Laozi said: "High rank and great profit are what people covet, yet compared to the self, they are base. Those who value rank esteem the world and belittle the self. Those who cultivate the Dao treasure the self and disdain wealth. Thus, the sage eats enough to fill the void and join qi, wears enough to cover the body and ward off cold, satisfies their nature and rejects excess, neither coveting gain nor hoarding abundance, content with sufficiency and discarding the surplus.

"With eyes clear, they do not see; with ears still, they do not hear; with mouth closed, they do not speak; with mind released, they do not ponder. They discard cleverness and return to primal simplicity, rest the spirit and abandon knowledge, without likes or dislikes—this is called 'great penetration.' To remove defilement and cast off burdens, nothing surpasses never having departed from one’s origin. What could not be accomplished? Never having departed from one’s origin means abiding in original emptiness and quiescence, without craving or attachment—thus the myriad entanglements, all defilements and burdens, arise. Therefore, to dispel and cleanse, return to the origin and restore simplicity.

"Those who know the harmony of nurturing life cannot be lured by profit; those who align the inner and outer tokens cannot be enticed by power. Coveting profit harms life; yearning for the world obstructs the Dao—these are what the perfected do not do. The outer of the without-outer is supremely great; the inner of the without-inner is supremely noble. Able to know the great and noble, where do they not succeed? The great Dao emerges without outer, enters without inner—nothing it does not penetrate, and this may be called 'supremely noble.'"

Laozi said: "The ancients who embodied the Dao ordered their nature and emotions, governed their mind and techniques, nurtured them with harmony, and maintained them with suitability. Delighting in the Dao, they forgot baseness; content in virtue, they forgot poverty. Attaining the harmony of nature and emotions, they forgot the distinctions of poverty and lowliness.

"Nature has what it does not desire; without desire, nothing is unattained. The heart has what it does not delight in; without delight, all that suits is achieved. With desire, what is desired is never enough; without delight, all that is fitting is fulfilled. What does not benefit nature is not used to burden virtue; what does not aid life is not used to disturb harmony. Fame and profit harm virtue; cravings and desires injure life—thus they are not pursued.

"Not indulging the self or giving free rein to desires, yet their standards can serve as models for the world. Naturally able to be reverent and cautious, they may serve as exemplars. Eating according to the belly’s measure, clothing according to the body’s form, dwelling to shelter the self, acting to suit the emotions, possessing the world without claiming it, entrusting the myriad things without profiting from them—how could they lose their nature and life over poverty or wealth, nobility or baseness? Those who are thus may be said to embody the Dao.

"Only those who embody the Dao and know contentment possess the world in surplus without profiting from the myriad things—how could they follow desires and harm their nature and life?"

Laozi said: "People receive qi from heaven—the ears and eyes in relation to sounds and sights, the nose and mouth in relation to fragrances and odors, the skin and flesh in relation to cold and warmth—their nature is one. Noble and base share this. Some die, some live; some become noble persons, some petty persons—the means by which they are governed differ. What they desire is the same; what they attain is different. Following the heart’s desires, they are controlled by things.

"Nature has worthy and foolish, emotions have thick and thin. Thus some are noble, some base; some die, some live—it is not uniform. The spirit is the abyss of wisdom; when the spirit is clear, wisdom is bright, and nothing is left unreflected. Wisdom is the storehouse of the heart; when wisdom is impartial, the heart is level."

The mind moves without private gain.
No one gazes into flowing water to see their reflection,
but gazes into still water—
because it is clear and tranquil.
Water does not become clear by itself to reflect,
nor does the spirit reside without clarity.

Thus, when the spirit is clear and the mind is level,
one can discern the true nature of things.
Only clarity and levelness
can perceive the essence of things.

Therefore, those who act must rely on those who do not act.
This is the interplay of *you* and *wu* (having and non-having),
of form and spirit in mutual preservation.

A mirror’s clarity means dust cannot soil it,
a spirit’s clarity means desires cannot mislead.
Clarity preserves the body from defilement,
purity preserves the spirit from error.

When the heart reaches its limit,
the spirit responds with presence—
heart and spirit in communion,
so when the heart arrives, the spirit abides.

Returning to emptiness,
agitation dissolves, breath hides—
this is the play of the Sage.

The heart knows no restlessness, the spirit’s luminosity drifts freely.
Thus, to govern the world,
one must first grasp the nature of life and destiny.

**On Upholding the True:**
Laozi said:
The so-called Sage adapts to nature alone.
Eating to fill the belly, clothing to suit the body,
restraining oneself—
thus, the heart of greed cannot arise.
Cutting off greed, nature finds its ease;
restraining food, vitality remains whole.

Therefore, those who can possess the world
must not cling to the world.
Those who can possess the world
do not cling to it;
those who earn renown
do not seek it through transgression.
Those who attain great renown and govern the world
do not act with arrogance.
Thus, the world willingly follows without exhaustion,
and though praised, the Sage does not boast—
so the people revere him without burden.

When one truly understands life and destiny,
benevolence and righteousness follow naturally.

Unless one discerns the divisions of success and failure,
the dispositions of people and things,
the world will come of its own accord,
and the people will attach themselves naturally.

As for the spirit unobstructed, the heart unburdened,
open and uncluttered, serene and unconcerned—
power and profit cannot tempt,
sounds and colors cannot seduce,
eloquence cannot persuade,
wisdom cannot sway,
courage cannot frighten—
this is the play of the True Person.

The spirit’s clarity is such that things cannot obscure it,
affairs cannot confuse it.
Though power may topple kings and nobles,
wealth accumulate like mountains,
sounds linger like clouds,
colors bewitch nations,
eloquence flows like chains,
wisdom rushes like rivers,
courage surpasses lifting weights—
even an ordinary man cannot be swayed,
how much less the True Person?

The ever-generating does not generate,
the ever-transforming does not transform.
Only the non-generating can generate,
the non-transforming can transform.
Neither generating nor transforming,
yet it is the root of all generation.

Those who do not grasp this Dao,
though they may organize heaven and earth,
illuminate sun and moon,
unravel intricate arguments,
or polish words like gold and stone—
it profits nothing in governing the world.

Not knowing the principles of life and destiny,
not heeding the subtle shifts of danger—
though they may revel in qi that swallows the cosmos,
or debate like rivers—
though called divine, they are rotten.
What use are they to the world?

Thus, the Sage does not abandon his foundation.
What he despises is power and fame;
what he values is virtue and the Dao.

**On Cultivating Stillness:**
Laozi said:
Stillness, tranquility, and simplicity—
these nourish life.
Harmony, ease, and emptiness—
these establish virtue.

Without tranquility and ease,
how could one preserve the Dao?
External chaos does not disturb the internal—
nature finds its proper place.
Stillness and non-action bring harmony—
virtue settles into its rightful position.
Nourishing life to sustain the world,
embracing virtue to complete one’s years—
this is to embody the Dao.

External things cannot disrupt,
internal harmony arises naturally.
Nurtured with substance,
it returns to its natural state.

Thus, blood and vessels flow without stagnation,
the five viscera gather no excess qi.
Calamity and fortune cannot sway,
praise and blame cannot soil.
Body and mind are open and unrestrained,
emotions and qi flow freely.
Fortune and misfortune are indistinct,
praise and blame are irrelevant.

Without its age, who could save it?
Even with talent but no fitting time,
the body itself cannot escape—
how much less without the Dao?

When ruler and subject meet,
it is like dragons responding—
extraordinary rulers use extraordinary people,
a rare encounter, once in a thousand years.
Now, talent may suffice for the age,
yet the times lack virtue—
the heart should transcend conventions,
without further seeking.
Thus, Wen Zheng met his end,
Fan Li drifted on the river.

Hence, the wise and foolish differ by vast distances.

He who examines the tip of autumn hair
cannot hear the thunder’s roar.
He who tunes to the sounds of gold and jade
cannot see Tai Shan’s form.
Thus, when one focuses on the small,
the great is forgotten.

Concentrating the eyes blinds the ears,
fixing the gaze dulls hearing.
Though thunder’s roar is not faint,
the deaf do not hear it—
not because they are deaf,
but because the heart does not divide its attention.
Though Tai Shan’s form is not small,
the blind do not see it—
not because they are blind,
but because the will does not serve multiple purposes.

Thus, those who see profit forget the Dao,
who submit to things abandon their bodies—
many are such cases.

Now, all things come and seize our life,
pluck our essence like springs—
though one might wish to avoid them,
how could it be done?

The pleasures of sound and color,
the delights of taste,
the allure of gold and jade—
they bewilder and dim the mind,
obscure the spirit.
They gather like wine cups,
deepening into vast chasms.
Unless one is a True Person,
how could they rise like wings to the heavens,
or soar like hairpins over the sea of wisdom?

Now, if water in a basin is made clear,
it takes days to see one’s eyebrows—
yet if muddy, even a moment’s disturbance
prevents seeing even a square inch.

Human spirit is hard to clarify but easy to muddy—
like water in a basin.
Common emotions are easily stained by convention.
Knowing that which is easily stained,
one must fortify the difficult path.

Water’s nature resists clarity in a vessel.
Understanding that which resists clarity,
one must remove the easy-to-dim mirror.

**On Upholding the Law:**
Laozi said:
The highest Sage follows Heaven,
doing nothing.

「Next, they honor the worthy—this is artificial teaching. Below that, they entrust their ministers. Entrusting ministers is the path of peril and decline, for political power lies with men, and peril and decline have no fixed day.

Honoring the worthy is the root of folly and bewilderment, for when the ruler honors the worthy, those beneath him will distort their nature to conform. Those who distort their nature are not true to their essence, hence the saying: "folly and bewilderment."

Following the Dao of Heaven is the Way to govern the cosmos. The Way of ruling the world is to align with Heaven’s movement. To be empty and tranquil is the foundation—empty, so as not to receive; tranquil, so as to hold. By upholding purity and stillness, one can sustain the world and become its sovereign.

Knowing the Way of emptiness and tranquility, one may achieve both beginning and end. Therefore, the Sage rules through stillness and is undone by action. Those who remain in stillness have minds unperturbed; those who govern rightly thus prevent the world from chaos.

Hence it is said:
Do not disturb, do not entangle—
and all things will naturally clarify.
Do not alarm, do not terrify—
and all things will naturally settle.
This is called the Dao of Heaven.

Disturbance is agitation; alarm is disorder.
To speak of the Way to govern the people thus,
then all the myriad folk and myriad things will not lose their place.

**On Guarding Weakness:**
Laozi said:
The Son of Heaven, princes, and dukes
treat the world and a single state as their home,
and all things as their livestock.
With the vastness of the world in their embrace,
and the abundance of all things,
their *qi* becomes overbearing, and their wills grow arrogant.
They boast of their greatness—
though great, they must perish;
they fear their peril—
though perilous, they may endure.

The great act with military force against the small,
while the small defy and oppress those beneath them.
Those who rely on strength perish,
and those who oppress others are extinguished.

If one’s heart is extravagant and broad,
it is like a gusting wind or violent rain—
unable to last long.

The Sage knows that strength and violence cannot endure,
thus he governs with Dao and virtue,
holding to the One without action,
and does not harm the natural flow of *qi*.
Only the Sage understands that strength and violence cannot last,
so he restrains them with virtue and power,
aligning with the natural inclinations of love and dislike—
thus the harmonious *qi* is unharmed, and great peace is attained.

To see the small and uphold the weak,
to retreat without leaving traces,
is the way to avoid ruin and achieve grandeur.

Model oneself after the rivers and seas:
the rivers and seas do not force their way,
so their achievements and renown naturally manifest.
They do not rely on strength,
so they can fulfill their sovereignty.
The Sage’s virtue is not seized,
and all things come to him naturally.

As the female principle of Heaven,
he endures without death.
The Sage’s spirit—
unclouded in the Nine Abysses,
unfading in the Three Purities—
originates from the boundless beginning,
how could it have an end?

He cherishes himself,
so his nobility is complete.
The might of a thousand chariots,
with all things as his achievements and renown,
holds the heaviest of responsibilities—
he cannot treat himself lightly.
To treat oneself lightly is to lose one’s achievements and renown.

The Dao of the Sage is vast,
yet it completes itself through the small,
and abundant through the few.
The Dao achieves the great through the small,
and all things follow the multitude while revering the One.

Thus, the Sage governs the world with the Dao:
the weak, gentle, and subtle—
this is seeing the small.
The frugal and restrained—
this is seeing the few.
Seeing the small, he achieves the great;
seeing the few, he fulfills the perfect.

He who holds the world
does not abandon the ministers of small states,
so he achieves the great.
He who governs himself
does not discard even a fragment of good,
so he attains perfection.

The Dao of Heaven
presses down the high and raises the low,
reduces the surplus and supplements the deficient.
Heaven’s Dao abhors excess while favoring humility,
so the rivers and seas occupy the world’s lowly places,
and thus all things return to them and revere them.

The Sage practices humility, purity, and stillness,
declining honors—
this is seeing the low.
The rivers and seas regard vast capacity as their greatness,
and the Sage regards humility as supreme.

To be empty of the heart and without possession—
this is seeing insufficiency.
Seeing the low, one attains the high;
seeing insufficiency, one fulfills one’s worth.

The proud cannot endure;
the extravagant cannot last;
the forceful and rigid perish;
the full and self-satisfied are doomed.
Those who preserve emptiness and weakness endure long,
while the proud and extravagant meet swift ruin.

Gusting winds and violent rains do not last a day,
small valleys cannot remain full even for a moment.
Gusting winds and violent rains embody the *qi* of forcefulness,
so they cannot endure and are extinguished.
Small valleys occupy the land of the forceful,
so they cannot help but be seized.

Thus, the Sage holds to the female principle,
rejecting extravagance and arrogance,
daring not to act with the *qi* of forcefulness.
By holding to the female principle,
he establishes his masculine sovereignty.
By not daring to be extravagant or arrogant,
he endures long.

Only when a man does not indulge in arrogance,
holding to the female principle while embodying the masculine,
does he become the King of the Many Heroes.

Laozi said:
The Dao of Heaven reaches its extreme and turns back;
excess leads to depletion.
The sun and moon are examples of this.
Thus, the Sage daily diminishes himself,
so his natural *qi* does not dare to be full.
He daily advances with the female principle,
and his virtue and merit do not decline—
this is the Dao of Heaven.

Heaven’s Dao abhors excess while favoring humility,
so the Tang and Yu followed it and became great men.
The Dao abhors violence and forbids arrogance,
so Jie and Zhou disregarded it and met ruin.

Human nature and inclinations
all favor the high and abhor the low,
favor gain and abhor loss,
favor profit and abhor harm,
favor honor and abhor disgrace,
favor nobility and abhor meanness.
The common folk act thus,
so they cannot achieve greatness.
To grasp thus is to lose what one seeks.

Therefore, the Sage follows Heaven:
he does not act yet achieves,
he does not grasp yet attains.
The common folk follow convention,
favoring high and honor,
abhorring low and disgrace,
so they seek to be high yet cannot elevate themselves.

The Sage follows Heaven,
neither favoring high and honor
nor abhorring low and disgrace,
so he is not honored yet is naturally honored,
not high yet is naturally high.

He shares emotions with others yet differs in the Dao,
so he endures long.

He dims his brilliance,
aligning himself with the dust of the common.
Hence, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had vessels of warning,
called *yòuzhī* cups.
When they were empty, they stood upright;
when they were full, they overturned.

Such vessels exist even today,
to preserve the utmost warning.
Hence, knowing emptiness brings self-preservation,
while excess cannot endure long.»

The Way of things is such:
When full, it decays;
when the sun is at its zenith, it declines;
when the moon is full, it wanes;
when joy reaches its end, sorrow follows.

The Dao of Heaven has its waxing and waning,
The Way of humanity has its rise and fall—
some begin with fortune yet end in misfortune,
some find joy in the front yet sorrow in the back.

Thus, the wise and learned guard their brilliance with simplicity,
for excess in knowledge leads to overanalysis.
Those with vast learning and eloquence guard with frugality,
for unrestrained speech harms what is true.

The strong and valiant guard with caution,
for relying on courage leads to recklessness.
The wealthy and noble guard with humility,
for clinging to arrogance brings many regrets.

The Sage who bestows virtue upon the world guards with modesty—
these five principles are how the ancient Kings preserved the world.

Those who embody this Way do not seek excess,
for only by avoiding excess can one prevent ruin from arising anew.
Diligently guarding one’s flaws and shortcomings,
not allowing them to swell into arrogance—
one who upholds this Way can preserve the world,
how much more so a single life?

Laozi said:
The Sage closes with yin and opens with yang.
What can be hidden is hidden,
what can be revealed is revealed.

To reach the state of no joy,
one must first attain the utmost joy—
no joy, then the highest joy is realized.
This is the joy within,
not the joy without;
thus, there is self-joy,
and thereby self-purpose.

To be cherished by the world,
one must first be the world’s necessity.
What is prized is not clanging music,
nor the eight tones,
nor refined colors or ornate beauty.

What is prized is clarity and emptiness,
the absence of action and desire—
this is the highest joy, yet not sought.

The joy within, outward,
brings joy to others,
and aligns one with Heaven.
The joy without, inward,
brings joy to oneself alone,
and becomes an enemy to the body.

Thus, to follow one’s own joy in joying others,
this is the essential Way of the world.
It does not lie in the external,
but in the self;
not in others,
but in the body.
When the body is at ease,
all things are gathered in harmony.

To seek it externally is to oppose the Dao;
to cultivate it within is to neighbor virtue.
Hence, those who grasp the principles of the heart’s cultivation
turn their cravings and aversions outward,
and thus find:
no delight, no anger,
no joy, no sorrow—
all things merge in the mysterious Oneness,
neither affirming nor denying.
When the heart’s cultivation is clear,
virtue and power will naturally form.

Sorrow and joy both forgotten,
likes and dislikes left in suspension—
all things unchanging,
naturally merge in the mysterious.

Thus, the scholar has fixed principles,
the woman has unyielding conduct.
The scholar’s Way is unshaken—
a thousand deceits cannot alter his resolve.
The woman’s conduct is steadfast—
a thousand gold cannot change her virtue.

He does not need rank to be honored,
nor wealth to be rich,
nor strength to be powerful.
He does not profit from goods and money,
nor crave worldly fame.
He does not find security in nobility,
nor peril in lowliness.
Form and body, qi and purpose,
each abides in its proper place.

Honoring the Dao, enriching virtue,
lightening rank, relinquishing profit—
purpose and qi clear, form and body harmonized.

The body is the dwelling of life,
qi is its foundation,
the spirit is its ruler.
If one loses its place,
all three are harmed.

These three—form, spirit, qi—
if the spirit departs,
form and qi wither.
If one loses its proper place,
where can the three find support?

Thus, those who take the spirit as master,
the body follows in benefit.
Those who take the body as master,
the spirit follows in harm.
Nurturing the spirit as master,
peace and stillness reside in the root—
then the spirit flows and qi is complete.

Nurturing the body as master,
if desires and harm have not yet taken hold,
the body perishes and the spirit flees.

As for life:
The gluttonous, greedy, and desirous,
are deluded by rank and profit,
bewitched by fame and position,
and though they possess others’ wisdom,
their spirit is consumed by worldly pursuits—
indulging without return,
the body’s gates closed in resistance,
and thus no way to enter.
Hence, there are times of utter forgetfulness and self-loss.

The spirit and purpose are hard to govern,
rank and fame are easy to be deceived by.
One must guard against inner resistance,
never opening to external influences—
yet still fear losing the means to serve the world,
and thus never be saved in life.

The spirit and purpose:
stillness makes them grow strong each day,
agitation makes them wither and grow old.
Stillness returns to no agitation,
and thus loses life.
Therefore, the Sage nurtures his spirit,
harmonizes and weakens his qi,
levels and smooths his form,
and rides the Dao’s rise and fall—
thus, all transformations of things
occur in perfect accord,
all changes of affairs
respond without fail.

When the spirit is harmonized,
qi is level,
purpose is strong,
and form is serene,
one can ride the Dao’s rise and fall,
adapt to the times’ changes,
and respond without doubt.

**Embodying Simplicity**

Laozi said:
The True Person’s nature aligns with the Dao—
thus, though he has, he seems without,
though he is real, he seems empty.
He cultivates within yet does not govern without,
illuminates the Great Simplicity,
acts without action and returns to the root.
He holds the origin and embraces the spirit,
wandering in the root of Heaven and Earth—
dimly resembling the dust and filth,
freely roaming in the business of no business.

To return to the root and embody truth,
is to wander in the root of Heaven and Earth.
To act without action, to have no business,
is to freely roam in the dust and filth.

Mechanical cleverness and contrived skill
are not carried in the heart.
He is certain in the unassumed,
does not shift with things.
True nature is already established,
external things cannot alter it.
Seeing the transformations of things,
he guards their essence—
his mind and intent focused within,
penetrating the unity of calamity and fortune.
Guarding the root without change,
seeing transformations without doubt,
fortune and calamity naturally clear—
how can elevation or decline bring burden?

He dwells without knowing what to do,
moves without knowing where to go—
his cultivation is effortless, without intent.
He knows without learning,
sees without looking,
accomplishes without doing,
discerns without governing.

Knowledge comes from the unknown,
vision from the unseen,
action from the inaction,
discernment from the undiscerned.

To know the unknown is true,
to know the known is false.
To respond and move,
to be pressed and act—
not to find one’s own way yet go,
like light’s reflection,
like shadow’s imitation—
moving like light,
flowing without stagnation.

The stillness is like a shadow,
dwelling while following the heart’s intent.

With the Dao as his guide,
he seems to have needs yet remains natural—
vast and empty,
clear and tranquil, yet nothing in particular.

He dwells alone in boundless openness,
yet suddenly appears to have needs.

He drifts without attachment,
yet truly has no concern at all.

A thousand lives as one transformation,
ten thousand forms as one root—
though the thousand lives differ,
they all ride upon the same transformation;
though the ten thousand forms vary,
they all emerge from the same emptiness.

He holds his essence yet does not expend it,
possesses spirit yet does not employ it,
preserving within an undisturbed depth,
without outward use or labor.

He upholds the pristine simplicity of *Taihun*,
establishing the utmost refinement within.
Nurturing truth and cultivating spirit,
his essence is pure, his spirit refined.

His sleep knows no dreams,
cutting off all thought.
His wisdom does not sprout,
holding no other concerns.
His movement is formless,
his spirit’s work subtle.
His stillness is bodiless—
existing yet as if nonexistent,
alive yet as if dead—
entering and exiting without obstruction,
commanding ghosts and spirits,
ascending to the Dao’s borrowed forms—
those who now say "existing is nonexistent,
living is death"
call it abandoning the body, discarding intelligence,
forsaking form and severing wisdom.

Thus, entering and exiting without obstruction,
commanding ghosts and spirits—
this is ascending to the Dao’s borrowed forms.

He lets his spirit flow freely,
yet does not lose his original *yuan*—
the *yuan* being the refined *qi*.
Day and night without pause,
he harmonizes with all things as spring—
like the sun of spring illuminating the ten thousand forms,
how could there be any boundary to shift?

This is the merging of life and transformation within the heart.
Not relying on external techniques,
only the heart aligning with the Dao.

Thus, though the body may weaken,
the spirit never transforms;
though the body may vanish,
the spirit remains ever present.
With the untransformed responding to transformation,
through myriad changes and endless turns,
yet never reaching an end—
only the untransformed can transform,
so hidden and revealed are boundless,
changes and transformations endless.

Transformation returns to the formless,
the untransformed coexists with Heaven and Earth—
so the ever-emerging never truly emerges,
its emergence is the very transformation;
transformation never truly transforms,
its transformation is the very transformation.
All things receive life and transformation,
yet cannot help but be born and transformed.
Thus, it sinks into the formless,
yet Heaven and Earth can generate and transform without ceasing.
Therefore, it is always generating, always transforming.

This is the true person’s wandering,
the pure and refined Dao.

Speaking of pure *qi* and exquisite subtlety,
wandering the path of neither birth nor transformation—
thus he is called the true person.

**Scroll Four of *Tongxuan Zhenjing*, with notes by Mòxī Zǐ.**

**Scroll Four of *Tongxuan Zhenjing* (Continued)**

**On the Symbol (符):**
The *symbol* is the *contract* (契).
The *word* is the *principle* (理).
Thus, through the subtle interplay of words and principles,
one awakens to the Dao and forgets the words—
this is indeed profound.

Laozi says:
The Dao is most exalted, without surpassing above,
most profound, without limit below.
Above, it transcends the highest;
below, it reaches the lowest—
thus it can be both lofty and profound,
ascending and descending.

Level as the plumb-line, straight as the square.
It is not the balance that makes it level,
yet there is no place not even.
It is not the square that makes it straight,
yet there is no place not upright.

Round as the compass, square as the carpenter’s rule—
it is not roundness that makes it round,
yet there is no roundness;
it is not squareness that makes it square,
yet there is no square.

It encompasses Heaven and Earth,
yet has no exterior or interior.
Its greatness knows no outer bound,
its subtlety knows no inner void.
Piercing as a covering, yet unobstructed—
the great circle has no edge,
the great passage has no hindrance.

Thus, those who embody the Dao:
neither angry nor joyful,
sitting without care,
sleeping without dreams,
seeing things yet naming them not,
actions arising yet responding naturally.
*(As previously explained.)*

Laozi says:
Those who cling to fame as a corpse
must generate affairs—
when affairs arise, they abandon the public for the private.
Those who cling to fame as a master
must have affairs—
when affairs arise, they lose harmony.
Thus, abandon fame and seek harmony.

To double the Dao and trust oneself,
to see praise and act virtuously,
to stand and be called "accomplished"—
*double* means to betray.
Betraying the Dao to seek praise is not true joy.
Conforming to trends to gain fame is not true virtue.

If governance does not align with principle,
and actions do not follow the times,
governance misaligned with principle brings many reproaches,
actions misaligned with the times yield no merit.
To align with principle is to use little effort yet achieve great deeds;
to ride the times is to expend much force yet see little gain.

To contrive for centrality—
when success is achieved, it is insufficient to fulfill obligations,
when failure occurs, it brings ruin to oneself.
Those who seek fame and immediate results,
who pursue harmony with the times—
their undertakings are unfinished,
their failures extend to themselves.

Laozi says:
Do not be a corpse of fame,
do not be a treasury of schemes,
do not be a burden of affairs,
do not be a master of cleverness.
Hide in the formless,
act without weariness.
Do not precede blessings,
do not initiate calamities.
Move without taking the lead—
then there is no form,
and no form means no welcome of fortune.
Respond only when called—
then there is no weariness,
and no weariness means no future calamities.

Begin in the formless,
act only when unavoidable.
To desire blessings first is to invite calamities;
to seek profit first is to court harm.
To govern before signs appear is to invite blessings;
to cut off extraordinary gains is to avoid harm.

Thus, those who act without action yet find peace—
if they lose what they rest in, they become perilous.
Those who govern without action yet rule—
if they lose what they govern, they bring chaos.
To lose what one rests in means
abandoning inner peace to seek it externally—
then one is constrained.
To lose what one governs means
forsaking oneself to govern others—
then one is deluded.

Thus, do not be like jade, polished and coveted,
nor like stone, rejected and ignored.
For jade and stone have their distinctions,
yet contention arises from them.
The finest carvings strip the skin,
the most beautiful horns bring slaughter.
Sweet springs will dry up,
straight trees will be felled.
Things of beauty invite harm,
people who crave fame summon misfortune.

Fine words bring later regret—
first to adorn speech,
then to invite ruin upon oneself.
Mountains yield jade, yet their peaks are scarred;
mountains that hide treasure are dug up.
People who speak carelessly invite calamities.
The commoner’s woes begin with idle words.

Moreover, the virtuous must be cautious—
even then, they have threefold silence.
The petty-minded, with their loose tongues,
how can they avoid disaster?

Laozi says:
The times move, and actions follow—
those who do not know Dao turn blessings into calamities.
People follow the times in their actions,
yet those who do not know Dao perish in their blessings.

The sage governs through the Dao:
knowing beforehand life and death,
measuring beforehand gain and loss.
Thus, expanding or contracting is without fixed form,
honor and disgrace do not disturb—
only then does one attain completion,
and good fortune preserves the body.

As for the ignorant,
they often receive blessings yet act tyrannically—
thus, when blessings reach their peak, calamities arise.
It is not that blessings and calamities cancel each other,
but that their actions are misaligned with their use.

Heaven is the covering, Earth is the axle—
those who skillfully use the Dao will never be exhausted.
Earth as the axle, Heaven as the covering—
those who skillfully use the Dao will never be harmed.
To use Earth as the axle is to cover without limit, all beneficent.
To use Heaven as the covering is to move without end, yet cause no harm.

The Five Phases are arranged—
each has its victor:
Metal and Fire attack each other.
The King of Chu succeeded in turn.

What Heaven covers is without exception,
Heaven’s Dao is vast and all-inclusive.

Thus, to know without knowing is superior,
to not know while knowing is illness.
To know the unknown is virtue,
to not know while knowing is folly.

Laozi says:
Mountains produce metal,
stones produce jade—
yet they erode each other.
Trees breed worms,
which devour them.
People create affairs,
which destroy themselves.
Fame brings the Dao’s decline,
undertakings invite harm.

Those who love affairs never fail to be entangled,
those who seek profit never fail to be exhausted.
No one crosses water without wetting their feet,
no one walks in dust without staining their body.
Skilled swimmers drown,
skilled riders fall—
each perishes by their own inclination.

Boasting of ability destroys their merit,
flaunting strength destroys their lives.
It must be so.

Success lies in timing, not in struggle,
governance lies in the Dao, not in the sage.
Timing is naturally obtained,
no need for forced contention.
The Dao lies in self-respect—
why bother with boasting of wisdom?

Earth dwells low yet does not vie for height,
thus it is stable and not perilous.
Water flows downward yet does not compete for speed,
thus it departs and is not delayed.

What makes the Dao precious,
what the virtuous hold in esteem—
is to be high without contending,
to be swift without haste.

Thus, the sage holds nothing fast and so loses nothing,
acts without action and so meets no defeat.
The Dao has no form or shape,
cannot be grasped—
to seize it is to lose it.
It is not a physical body,
cannot be carved—
to force it is to fail.

Laozi says:
One word cannot be exhausted,
two words make the world’s foundation,
three words make the feudal lords mighty,
four words make the world’s pairs.

Sincerity and trust cannot be exhausted,
virtue and Dao make the world’s foundation,
promoting the worthy makes the feudal lords mighty,
hating the few and loving the many makes the world’s pairs.

「Whoever attains all four phrases,
ascends to become the **Emperor** or **Son of Heaven**,
while those who grasp only one
descend to become **Conquerors** or **Assistants**.

Laozi says:
Humans have three deaths,
though not by fate.

Those who speak of "not by fate"
are themselves the cause.

Excessive indulgence in food and drink,
despising one’s own worth,
brings illness that kills;
unrestrained pleasure,
endless craving,
invites punishment that kills;
to assault the many with few,
to challenge the strong with weakness,
invokes war that kills.

Thus, death and life lie within us,
misfortune and blessing have no gate—
they do not descend from Heaven,
but arise from human deeds.

Laozi says:
The greater the gift,
the finer the return;
the deeper the grudge,
the graver the calamity.

To give little yet expect much,
to harbor resentment yet seek no harm—
such things do not exist.

Observe how one proceeds,
and one shall know whence they came.

Great deeds bring great rewards,
deep grudges invite great woes;
according to their weight,
one leaves behind neither favor nor enmity.

Laozi says:
Fathom **Heavenly Fate** (*tiān mìng*),
refine one’s **inner cultivation** (*xīn shù*),
balance **affection and aversion** (*hào zēng*),
harmonize **emotions and nature** (*qíng xìng*),
and the **Dao** is thus mastered.

To fathom **Heavenly Fate** (*tiān mìng*)
is to remain undisturbed by misfortune and blessing;
to refine one’s **inner cultivation** (*xīn shù*)
is to neither recklessly rejoice nor rage;
to balance **affection and aversion** (*hào zēng*)
is to avoid wasteful greed;
to harmonize **emotions and nature** (*qíng xìng*)
is to restrain desire without excess;
to remain undisturbed by misfortune and blessing
is to move and rest in accordance with **Nature’s Way** (*lǐ*);
to neither recklessly rejoice nor rage
is to neither favor nor punish arbitrarily;
to avoid wasteful greed
is to not let desire harm one’s **True Nature** (*xìng*);
to restrain desire without excess
is to nurture life by knowing contentment.

All these four principles
require no external seeking,
no reliance on others—
they are attained by turning inward.

To comprehend these four is to be **greatly enlightened** (*dà tōng*).

Do not depend on others,
only simplify and purify oneself.

Laozi says:
Do not seek to justify one’s actions,
do not resent others for criticizing you—
if one acts without deceit,
why would others blame you?

Cultivate the **virtue of benevolence and forgiveness** (*rén shù*),
and you will have no cause to reproach others.
If you strive for **unfailing reputation** (*rú*),
yet do not seek others’ praise,
and trust only in your own self-cultivation—
you cannot ensure misfortune will not come,
nor that blessing will always arrive.
You cannot prevent unforeseen calamity,
nor can you compel fate to grant your wishes.
Blessing that must come,
you must receive when it arrives.
Misfortune that comes,
is not of your own making—
so though in straits, why worry?
Blessing that comes,
is not of your own doing—
so though prosperous, why boast?

Thus, one finds joy in **idleness and ease** (*xián jū*),
governs without **action** (*wéi*),
and drifts content in **tranquility and freedom** (*yōu yóu*).

Laozi says:
The **Dao**-practitioner guards what they already possess,
and does not seek what they have not yet attained.
To seek what they have not yet attained
is to lose what they already possess;
to follow what they already possess
is to gain what they desire.

What one already possesses is the **spirit of the body** (*shēn qíng*),
what one has not yet attained are **multifarious techniques** (*qí shù*).
Now, if one abandons the **spirit of the body** (*shēn qíng*)
and begs for **multifarious techniques** (*qí shù*),
the unattained will not arrive,
and what was attained will be forgotten.
One cannot safeguard the **origin of attainment** (*dé yī*),
nor can one undo the **regret of double loss** (*liáng shī*).

Thus, the **Perfect Person** (*zhì rén*) holds fast to their **root** (*běn*),
does not chase after **external methods** (*mò*),
values what is **innerly attained** (*nèi*),
and governs what is **externally imposed** (*wài*).

If governance is not yet **firmly established** (*wèi gu*),
yet one acts as if governing—
this is perilous.
If conduct is not yet **free from fault** (*wú fēi*),
yet one rushes to seek fame—
this is self-destructive.

When the **root is firm**, the state is at peace;
when conduct is **comprehensive**, one suffers no disgrace.

Thus, no blessing is greater than **freedom from misfortune**,
no gain is greater than **avoiding loss**.

To be free from misfortune is the **height of blessing**,
to avoid loss is the **greatest of gains**.

Thus, some things may seem to bring **benefit** yet cause **harm**,
while others may seem to bring **harm** yet cause **benefit**.
Only when free from misfortune and blessing
does one escape both **harm** and **benefit**.

What cannot be **urged** to seek **gain**
is the way to **settle the spirit** (*ān shén*)
and **avoid peril**.

The **Dao** cannot be **lured** by **gain**,
for without **gain**, there is no **harm**—
thus the spirit is naturally at ease,
and the **Dao** comes effortlessly.

Therefore, one who **tastes no misfortune** does not **taste blessing**,
one who **commits no wrong** does not **earn merit**.

To be free from misfortune and blessing,
free from wrong and merit—
this is called **great enlightenment** (*dà tōng*).

The **Dao** speaks thus:
**"Vague and indistinct** (*máng máng mèi mèi*),
follow **Heaven’s majesty** (*tīan wēi*),
align with **Heaven’s qi** (*tīan qì*),
without thought or calculation,
without scheming or storing."

The **Dao** says:
"Is the **Dao** a **ruler** (*jūn*)?"

**"Vague and indistinct"** (*máng mèi*)
refers to the **Dao’s profound mystery** (*yǎo míng*), unseen by mortals.

Now, if one merely **imitates Heaven** (*fǎ tiān*) with **emptiness** (*xū*),
**preserves the body** (*shēn*) with **non-action** (*wú*),
and **refines the heart** (*xīn*) without **scheming** (*lǜ*)—
then **virtues accumulate** (*wù jī*) without effort,
and **things manifest** (*shí chéng*) without labor.

**Departing** is not **forced away**,
**arriving** is not **summoned**—
one simply **allows it to unfold naturally** (*rèn zī zì dé*).

Though humans move **east, west, south, or north**,
they stand **alone at the center** (*zì yú zhōng yāng*),
their **bodies respond to things** (*shēn yìng wù*) yet **endure without limit** (*wú qióng*),
while the **Dao abides in the center** (*zhēn qì liú zhuǎn*) and **moves alone** (*dú yùn*).

Thus, though surrounded by **crookedness** (*qū*),
one does not lose their **straightness** (*zhí*),
for **completeness in flexibility** (*qū quán*) is **greatness**.

To flow with the **world** (*tiān xià*) yet **never stray** (*bìng liú bù lí qí yù*)
is the **Dao’s vital breath** (*zhī qì liú zhuǎn*),
its **true essence** (*zhēn jīng*) ever preserved.

Neither **pursuing goodness** nor **avoiding ugliness**,
one follows **Heaven’s Way** (*tiān dào*),
does not **begin with oneself** (*bù wéi shǐ*),
does not **cling to self** (*bù zhuān jǐ*),
conforms to **Nature’s principles** (*tiān lǐ*),
does not **prematurely plot** (*bù yù móu*),
does not **reject the appointed time** (*bù qì shí*),
aligns with **Heaven’s decree** (*yǔ tiān wéi qī*),
does not **seek what is obtained** (*bù qiú dé*),
does not **spurn what is blessed** (*bù cí fú*),
and follows **Heaven’s natural order** (*cóng tiān zhī zé*).

**Heaven** has no **intent** (*wú xīn*) nor **speaks** (*wú yán*),
yet all **things are born** (*wàn wù shēng rén*).
**Non-action** (*wú wéi*) and **no scheming** (*wú móu*)
yet all **affairs are accomplished** (*bǎi shì suì*).

Within, there is no **extraordinary blessing** (*qí fú*),
without, there is no **extraordinary misfortune** (*qí huò*),
so misfortune and blessing **do not arise** (*wú huò fú*),
and thus there is no **human thief** (*rén zéi*).

All blessings inevitably bring misfortune,
but now misfortune and blessing are **concealed** (*yǐ míng*),
who then **harms others** (*zéi hài*)?

Thus, **great virtue** (*zhì dé*)—
its words are **like a single axle** (*shìng biāo*),
its deeds are **like a single blessing** (*shìng fú*),
the **hearts of all** (*shàng xià yī xīn*) are unified,
there is no **divergence in paths** (*wú qí dào*),
and those who **perceive things partially** (*piān jiàn*) are **drawn back to error** (*tuì zhī yú xié*).

Open the **Way** to **goodness** (*kāi dào zhī yú shàn*),
and the people will **turn toward uprightness** (*mín xiàng fāng yǐ*).

Partial perception is insufficient to **persuade the common folk** (*huà sú*),
but the **true Way** (*zhèng dào*) can **guide the people** (*yǒu kě yòu mín*).

Laozi says:
To **do good** (*wéi shàn*) is to **exhort** (*quàn*),
to **do evil** (*wéi bù shàn*) is to **observe and restrain** (*guān quàn*).
To **exhort** (*quàn*) is to **invite censure** (*shēng zé*),
to **observe and restrain** (*guān*) is to **incite resentment** (*shēng huàn*).

**Exhortation** (*quàn*) means **encouraging oneself** (*rén wéi shàn*),
while **observation and restraint** (*guān*) means **seeing one’s own faults** (*chá jiàn jǐ guò*).
If one sees their own faults,
they will **turn toward uprightness** (*xiàng fāng yǐ*).

One cannot avoid doing good.

If one examines their own goodness while seeking out others’ faults to censure them, then misfortune will arise.
Thus, exhorting to goodness while failing to practice it—this is misfortune.

Therefore, the Way cannot be advanced to seek fame,
but can be withdrawn to cultivate the self.
Thus, the Sage does not act to seek fame,
nor does he display knowledge to gain praise.
Governance follows natural order,
and he remains uninvolved in external affairs.

To advance without embellishing wisdom to seek fame,
to withdraw and cultivate the self to govern oneself—
to push matters along naturally,
how could one seek human praise?

The doer may fail to succeed,
the seeker may fail to obtain,
while humans may reach their limits,
the Way remains unobstructed.

Humans may seek without attaining the Way,
but non-action (*wuwei*) suffices to encompass all.

With wisdom yet without action, one’s efficacy equals that of the unwisely;
with ability yet without exertion, one’s virtue equals that of the incapable.
Having wisdom yet appearing unwisely,
having ability yet appearing unable—
when the Dao is realized, human talent is extinguished.

The Sage’s supreme virtue fills within,
while human talent vanishes without—
thus, having yet appearing as lacking,
substantial yet seeming empty.

Humans and the Way cannot both be manifest;
if humans love fame, they will not use the Way.
If the Way surpasses humans, fame will cease;
if the Way ceases, human fame will flourish—then danger and ruin follow.

The Way must be unified;
affairs cannot be fully dual.
Laozi says:
To let honest men divide wealth,
it is better to fix portions by casting lots—
why?
Those with intent in leveling wealth
are inferior to those without intent.

To let virtuous men guard wealth,
it is better to seal the doors and keep it intact—
for those with desires among the common folk
are inferior to those without desires.

Casting lots resolves doubt through non-intent,
while the common folk are constrained by desire.

If one’s flaws are exposed, resentment arises;
if one’s ugliness is reflected, one will improve.
The wise, when their faults are pointed out, reflect and amend.
The foolish, self-praising, claim goodness.

If one interacts with others without entangling oneself,
one avoids burdens.
Prioritizing others over oneself,
one will never incur blame.

Laozi says:
When dealing with people,
one does not rely on treasures or gifts,
but on humble words—
simple offerings yet desires are never exhausted.
The noble do not value treasures;
they use modest attire and demeanor to show respect.
If one practices this,
over time, desires will not be sated.

Humble bearing avoids reproach;
discourse without entanglement—
binding oaths and alliances,
once agreed, are fulfilled as originally promised.
The noble’s bonds are not forged by oaths;
a single word suffices to settle matters for life.
The petty’s bonds rely on pledges,
yet within days, they betray their former agreements.

Thus, the noble do not externally display virtue and righteousness
while internally cultivating morality and virtue.
Internally, they embody sincerity and purity;
externally, they have no false adornment.

They govern affairs within their domain,
expand their territory’s reach,
exhort the people to defend to the death,
strengthen their walls and fortifications,
and unite the people to protect the ancestral altars.
They do not attack the innocent for gain,
nor do they assault what is difficult to obtain—
this is the Way of absolute preservation,
the principle of absolute benefit.

Sharing benefits with the people,
the people will gladly die for them.
Sharing intentions with the people,
the people will steadfastly defend them.

Those who seek fame are not greedy;
those who seek profit do not overstep boundaries—
this is the Sage-King’s Way,
the shared defense of the ancestral altars,
the unified fortification of borders.

Laozi says:
The Sage does not conquer his heart,
while the common folk do not conquer their desires.
When the heart prevails, the Way is complete;
when desires prevail, the heart is in peril.

The noble act with upright qi,
the petty act with perverse qi.
Internally, it aligns with nature;
externally, it conforms to righteousness—
moving according to principle,
unconstrained by external things—this is upright qi.

Indulging in tastes and sounds,
erupting in joy and anger,
without regard for future consequences—this is perverse qi.

Perverse and upright qi harm each other;
desires and nature conflict—
they cannot coexist,
one flourishes while the other declines.
Thus, the Sage reduces desires and follows nature.

The eyes love color,
the ears love sound,
the nose loves fragrance,
the mouth loves flavor—
when combined, they bring delight,
yet never separate from harm and desire.

The ears, eyes, nose, and mouth
know not what they truly desire—
all are governed by the heart,
each finding its place.

From this, it is clear that desires cannot be fully satisfied.

The six senses’ desires are all governed by the heart.
If qi is upright within,
desires will not harm nature.
If the heart is perverse externally,
falsehood will confuse the true.

Thus, uprightness and perversity lie within oneself;
gain and loss depend on the heart.
If the heart is upright,
how can external things burden it?

Laozi says:
To govern the body and nurture nature,
one must regulate sleep and rest,
moderate eating and drinking,
harmonize joy and anger,
adapt movement and stillness—
what is internal to oneself is attained,
and goodness is not sought externally.
Thus, perverse qi has no way to enter.

Adorning the exterior harms the interior;
indulging emotions harms the spirit—
those who see only surface appearances obscure the true.

He who never forgets his virtue as an honorable man
will surely exhaust his nature.
To speak of a man’s virtue without pause,
if even for a moment he is separated from it,
he will surely suffer humiliation.

Within a hundred paces, one must not forget they are a guest,
lest they burden their form.

To assist the body and govern nature,
one must moderate drinking and maintain harmony,
so that the heart’s qi remains balanced within,
and the spirit may be preserved.
The noble are cautious of subtle matters,
not because they are distant—
even within ten steps,
one must consider the danger of rotting wood;
in the blink of an eye,
unexpected misfortune may strike—
how can one be negligent?

Thus, those with splendid plumage are harmed by their bones,
those with lush foliage are harmed by their roots—
none under heaven can possess dual perfections.

The phoenix is harmed by its plumage,
spring blossoms are plucked for their fragrance.
Things with dual beauties,
affairs with dual benefits—
such things do not exist.

Laozi says:
Heaven has light,
yet does not fear the people’s darkness.
Earth has wealth,
yet does not fear the people’s poverty.

Heaven’s Way is bright and expansive,
penetrating even the deepest obscurity.
Earth’s bounty nourishes all things,
its benefits are boundless and reach everywhere.

The Sage’s supreme virtue and Way
stands like a towering mountain, unmoving—
the traveler takes it as their destination.
Straightening oneself while fulfilling others,
not bestowing, nor receiving in return—
thus, it is stable and enduring,
uninvolved with Heaven and Earth,
and thus cannot be taken,
cannot be repaid,
and thus cannot incur resentment.

The Perfect Person,
by name and reputation cannot be swayed,
by harm and desire cannot be toppled—
steadfast alone, immovable as a mountain.

With their constant sufficiency, they do not accept gifts;
when they take, they suffer no loss—
thus, when given to, they lack no virtue,
when taken from, they incur no resentment,
and thus they endure forever.

The skillful in anger must bear many grudges;
the skillful in giving must be skillful in taking.
Only by following the natural Way of Heaven and Earth
can one overcome the rules of the world.

Transcending the realm of joy and anger,
forgetting the feelings of giving and taking,
letting things unfold naturally,
to preserve the fullness of Heaven’s Way.

Thus, praise arrives and destruction follows,
good fortune comes and misfortune follows—
benefits become harms at their outset,
blessings become calamities before they unfold.
Not seeking benefit means no harm,
not seeking fortune means no misfortune—
the body remains whole as its natural state,
wealth and honor are but transient lodgings.

Praise is what people admire,
good fortune is what people covet.
But if one does not crave display,
there will be slander and resentment—
unless one utterly rejects praise and good fortune,
there will be no slander or resentment.
If one neither boasts nor flaunts,
naturally there is no calamity nor blessing,
and virtue and Way remain intact.

The body remains whole as its natural state,
wealth and honor are but transient lodgings.

Laozi says:
The Sage wears no strange or wondrous garments,
nor adopts bizarre or ostentatious conduct.
Their attire is simple, their actions unobserved—
they do not startle the crowd, nor act contrary to others.
They are open yet not extravagant,
humble yet not fearful,
honored yet not flamboyant,
hidden yet not humiliated,
different yet not strange—
poverty and prosperity are but fate.

Thus, they are not extravagant nor constrained.
Honor and obscurity are but the times—
thus, they are neither flamboyant nor humiliated.
Though they differ from others,
what is there to find strange?
To act in harmony without distinction—
this is called Great Harmony.
When actions are without distinction,
there is no obstruction—
this is Great Harmony.

Laozi says:
The Way is to straighten oneself and await fate,
when time arrives, one cannot force it forward,
when time departs, one cannot summon it back—
thus, the Sage does not advance to seek nor retreat to yield.
Straightening the body, awaiting fate,
following the Way, conforming to time—
not leading, not resisting.

Three years in accordance with time,
time departs and I follow,
three years in its absence,
time returns and I linger behind—
neither going nor coming,
steadfast in their place.

This speaks of the excess of going too far ahead,
the inadequacy of falling too far behind—
only by meeting time without resistance
can one stand firm in their place.

The Dao/Way has no favorites,
only virtue does it bestow.
When fortune arrives,
it is not what one sought—
thus, they do not boast of their merit.
When calamity comes,
it is not what one created—
thus, they do not regret their actions.
This has already been explained.

The mind remains tranquil and unburdened,
virtue is not weighed down—
without praise, they do not strive,
without honor or disgrace, they are not shaken.
The barking of dogs does not disturb them,
they trust in their own nature—
truly without excessive desires.
Self-illuminated, they have no falsehood—
thus, they are not shaken nor afraid.

Therefore, those who understand the Way are not confused,
those who know fate are not anxious.
To know the Way and know fate,
what anxiety, what fear?

When the Emperor’s death occurs,
their remains are left in the wild—
their spirits are enshrined in the Hall of Brightness,
for the spirit is nobler than the form.
This shows the ancient Emperors returning their remains to the wild,
not sealing nor erecting tombs,
to teach the people that all things must end;
enshrining spirits in the Hall of Brightness,
not flattering nor being extravagant,
to teach the people to know solemnity.

Thus, when the spirit governs the form, it prospers;
when the form overcomes the spirit, it declines.
Though wisdom is employed,
it must return to the spirit—
this is called Great Harmony.

Relying on the spirit, the form remains whole;
indulging desires, the spirit departs.
Unless one is truly enlightened,
how can they preserve it?

Laozi says:
The ancients who preserved themselves
rejoiced in virtue and forgot disgrace—
thus, their names did not sway their resolve.
They rejoiced in the Way and forgot poverty—
thus, benefits did not sway their hearts.
Hence, they could be humble yet joyful,
quiet yet unperturbed.

Virtue and Way complete the body,
poverty and deficiency bring no shame—
the heart and resolve remain unbroken,
benefits and fame do not confuse them.
Thus, they can be humble,
joyful in stillness,
and unperturbed.

Counting life by numbers,
worrying over the world’s chaos,
is like worrying over the drying of the Yellow River—
weeping to increase it, yet to no avail.
Thus, they do not worry over the world’s chaos,
but rejoice in their own self-order—
such a person can speak of the Way.

It is like one who does not worry over their life’s end,
but worries over the world’s disorder—
weeping a few drops of tears,
desiring to augment the Yellow River’s flow—
this is of no benefit.
Only by forgetting to rule others
and instead ordering oneself
can one speak of the Way.

Laozi says:
People have three resentments—
those of high rank are envied by others,
those of great office are despised by their superiors,
those of abundant wealth are resented by the people.
High yet able to be humble,
abundant yet able to disperse—
this is how one preserves their elemental good fortune.

The higher the rank, the lower the intent,
the greater the office, the smaller the heart,
the richer the wealth, the broader the giving—
cultivating these three, resentment does not arise.

Thus, nobility takes humility as its root,
height takes lowliness as its foundation.
If these three are not cultivated,
calamity befalls oneself.

Laozi says:
Words are used to convey one’s own nature to others,
listening is used to receive others’ nature into oneself.
Expressing one’s own nature to reach others’,
obtaining others’ intentions to harmonize with one’s own.

If one is both blind and deaf,
the Way of humanity is blocked—
thus, those afflicted with blindness and deafness
do not know how to harmonize.
Is it only the body that can be blind and deaf?
The heart also has its own obstructions—
the eyes cannot see the great mountains,
the ears cannot hear the thunder—
this is the body’s blindness and deafness.
To discern a deer or a horse but not their reflections,
to know chili and wheat yet not their distinctions—
this is the blindness and deafness of humanity.

If one cannot discern even ordinary matters,
how much less can they grasp the Great Way?
Those who do not know how to harmonize
are of the kind blind and deaf.

The Way as the ultimate source,
all things with form arise from it—
its kinship is vast.
Those who nourish on grains and breathe on *qi*,
all attain longevity—
its lordship is vast.
All who possess wisdom learn from it—
its guidance is vast.

Life arises from the Way as its kin,
formless yet forming—
its kinship is great.
Grains and *qi* are its lords,
not conferring longevity—
its lordship is vast.
Wisdom is its teacher,
not conferring enlightenment—
its guidance is vast.

The virtue’s generosity is profound,
wisdom takes learning as its teacher—
not a teacher yet teaching—
its clarity is supreme.

All men harm the useful with the useless,
toiling in vain while wounding deep affections.
Thus knowledge unbroadened knows no end,
the noble man ever laments his limits,
striving to spur himself onward.

To ask of *weiqi* while playing *yìshí*,
one’s hearing and seeing grow profound.
To redirect *yìshí*’s efforts toward Dao and virtue,
one may attain profound subtlety.

Not to hear nor ask is like the blind and deaf among men.
To hear yet not question—this is true blindness and deafness.

Laozi said:
*"By nature, men’s hearts submit to virtue,
not to force—
one may govern with virtue,
but never with force."*

Virtue comes or does not come of its own accord.
Virtue bestowed upon others expects no return.

Thus the Sage who desires to be honored by others
first honors them,
who desires to be esteemed by others
first esteems them,
who desires to overcome others
first overcomes himself,
who desires to be humble before others
first humbles himself.
Hence nobility and humility, esteem and lowliness—
Dao governs them.

The ancient Sage-Kings spoke humbly to the people,
placed themselves behind them,
and though the world joyfully pushed them forward,
they bore it without resentment,
though the world burdened them,
they carried it without weariness—
this is virtue’s abundance and *qi*’s harmony.
Thus, to give is to take,
to follow is to lead—
this is the subtle Dao.

To honor others is not to take honor from them,
to precede others is not to take precedence from them—
this is *qi* harmonized with Dao,
virtue returning to oneself.
Thus they are pushed forward without resentment,
borne without burden.

Laozi said:
*"Few virtues yet many honors—reproach,
little talent yet high rank—danger,
great rewards without great deeds—disaster.
Thus some gain is loss,
some loss is gain.
When talent and office do not align,
ruin is inevitable.
Gain and loss follow one another—
calamity and fortune verify this."*

The common man knows only to profit from profit,
yet does not know that harm is profit’s disease.
Only the Sage knows harm as profit,
profit as harm.

The common man knows profit as profit,
yet does not know profit as harm’s root.
The Sage knows profit as harm,
takes non-harm as profit.

Thus twice-planted trees wound their roots,
houses hoarding wealth invite later calamity.
Great profit turns to harm—
this is Heaven’s Way.
Trees replanted must wound their roots;
houses storing treasures must invite ruin upon themselves.
What comes not by intent—
first profit, then harm—
this is Heaven’s Way.

Laozi said:
*"The petty man acts for ‘mere gain,’
the noble man acts for ‘mere righteousness.’
He who does good does not seek fame,
yet fame follows him.
Fame does not await profit,
yet profit comes to him.
Their aims are the same,
their ends differ.
The petty man acts for ‘mere gain’ as profit,
and profit follows him.
The noble man walks the straight path,
not awaiting profit,
yet profit comes to him.
Thus receiving profit is the same,
yet meeting harm differs.
Hence action brings benefit—
loss follows it.
Words without fixed truth,
actions without fixed propriety—
this is the petty man.
Unsteady in virtue,
he invites shame.
To perceive one thing,
to master one skill—
this is the mediocre man.
His vision unbroadened,
he is confined to one domain.
To encompass all and possess all,
to wield skills and employ talents—
this is the Sage.
To dismiss the wicked, banish evil,
to employ the worthy, use the capable—
this is the Sage.

Laozi said:
*"Life is what we borrow,
death is our return.
Thus in times of order, one guards the body with righteousness;
in times of chaos, one guards righteousness with the body.
The day of death is the end of one’s path.
In ordered times, one preserves the body with righteousness;
in chaotic times, one dies for righteousness.
Thus the noble man benefits others—
though he dies, he regrets nothing.
He views death as returning home,
just as life’s years.
Thus the noble man need only be cautious in one thing:
to act in accordance with Dao,
never straying from the true path.

Life is what we receive from Heaven,
fate what we encounter in time.
To have talent yet not meet the age—
this is Heaven.
To seek it has its method,
to obtain it lies in fate.
To meet the time—
not to meet Heaven—
to gain it without joy,
to lose it without blame.
The noble man can do good,
yet cannot guarantee fortune.
He cannot bear to do wrong,
yet cannot be certain to avoid calamity.
The noble man does good,
yet does not necessarily receive blessing.
To abandon evil does not necessarily distance calamity,
yet he never forsakes righteousness to seek fortune.
Easy to practice, easy to escape calamity—
why?
Because righteousness cannot be altered,
and the heart harbors no duplicity.
Thus the noble man meets the time and advances,
obtaining it through righteousness—
what fortune is there?
He does not meet the time and retreats,
yielding with propriety—
what misfortune is there?
Thus though he dwells in poverty and lowliness,
he never regrets it—
he has found what is truly noble.
The noble man does not consider advancement fortune,
for righteousness has given it to him.
He does not consider misfortune shame,
for what is there to regret?
What is cherished—Dao and righteousness—
how can it compare to poverty and lowliness?

Laozi said:
*"Man has harmonious and discordant *qi*,
born from the heart.
When the heart is orderly, *qi* is harmonious;
when the heart is disordered, *qi* is discordant.
The heart’s order or disorder lies in Dao and virtue.
To attain Dao, the heart is orderly;
to lose Dao, the heart is disordered.
An orderly heart brings yielding,
a disordered heart brings contention.
Yielding brings virtue,
contention breeds bandits.
Virtue brings harmonious *qi*,
bandits bring discordant *qi.
Unified in heart, *qi* is harmonious and upright;
divided in *qi*, it is discordant and perverse.
Uprightness elevates Dao,
perversity breeds harm.
Dao persists, the spirit clears,
clarity brings harmony and order.
Bandits arise, *qi* grows turbid,
turbidity brings contention and chaos.
Once turbid and chaotic,
ruin is inevitable.
Harmonious *qi* diminishes itself to nourish others,
discordant *qi* diminishes others to nourish itself.
These two *qi* may be mastered by Dao
and governed by oneself."*

The governance of trifles is difficult,
yet it can be mastered through Dao.

The Dao of Heaven is like the echo responding to sound:
virtue accumulates, and blessings arise;
calamity accumulates, and grievances arise.
Humans may act upon it,
Heaven may observe it—
good and evil will surely manifest,
just as echo follows sound.

Official virtue declines when office prospers,
filial piety wanes when wives and children thrive.
Calamity arises from neglecting worry,
disease recurs when near recovery.
Thus, to treat the end as the beginning,
there will be no failed undertakings.

Official virtue fails when law is abandoned,
filial piety fades when hidden in private matters.
Though worry may briefly ease,
calamity still lurks.
When near recovery, restraint must still be observed—
thus, to treat the end as the beginning,
there will be no failed undertakings.

Laozi says:
*"To raise the crooked with the straight—
how can this not be wrong?
To raise the straight with the crooked—
do not let it proceed,
for this is like mixing filth with different muds."*

Knowing people is not easy;
when selecting them, clarity is essential.
Now to raise the crooked as straight,
the foolish as wise—
how can this be like mixing filth with different muds?

Laozi says:
*"The sage unifies life and death,
the fool also unifies life and death.
The sage unifies life and death,
knowing the distinctions of principle;
the fool unifies life and death,
unaware of where harm and benefit lie.
The sage transcends life and death,
neither benefiting nor harming others,
thus there is no life or death.
The fool distinguishes life and death,
fixating on gain,
thus he fears death and life."*

Dao hangs from Heaven,
things spread across Earth,
harmony rests in humans.
If the ruler is not harmonious,
then Heaven’s *qi* does not descend,
Earth’s *qi* does not ascend,
yin and yang are unbalanced,
winds and rains are untimely,
and the people suffer hunger and sickness.
Dao depends on Heaven,
things arise from Earth,
harmony lies in humans.

Humans are Heaven’s essence,
Earth’s spirit.
Thus, as ruler over humans,
one must cultivate harmony,
stabilize *qi*,
nurture all things—
then winds and rains will not falter,
and calamities will not arise.

Laozi says:
*"To command ten thousand soldiers
is not as valuable as hearing one correct word;
to possess the Huisi pearl
is not as valuable as knowing the origin of things;
to possess the He Shi jade
is not as valuable as knowing the proper course of things.
One beneficial word surpasses ten thousand soldiers,
one proper action surpasses precious jade.
Though the world be vast,
those who love war perish;
though a state be secure,
those who love conflict are endangered.
Thus, small states with few people,
though possessing tenfold weapons,
should not use them.
Great states should cultivate virtue,
small states should serve others—
then conquest and war will not arise,
and all will be at peace."*

Laozi says:
*"Those who can achieve hegemony and kingship
must be certain victors—
they do not lead unless first.
Those who can defeat enemies
must be strong—
without virtue, they cannot prevail.
Those who are strong
must rely on human strength,
and those who rely on human strength
must win the people’s hearts—
using the worthy’s strength,
gaining the masses’ loyalty.
Those who win the people’s hearts
must first be self-possessed—
self-possessed, they are gentle and yielding,
able to conquer those weaker than themselves,
yet when facing equals, they yield.
Gentle strength emerges from yielding to equals,
and their affairs cannot be altered—
thus, though many oppose them,
they achieve great victory.
Only through preserving humility and gentleness
can they not be bent by the masses,
thus securing their triumph."*

The *Tongxuan Zhenjing* concludes, Volume Four. #1 [□], the original text unclear.

The *Tongxuan Zhenjing* concludes, Volume Five. **Defaulted Son’s Annotation** on *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power*:

This chapter first inquires into *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power*, then returns to *rites and wisdom*.
Though the previous volume has already made this clear, the inquiry is raised again—
for its profound and subtle nature,
it demands meticulous examination,
to establish the path for future disciples to awaken to the Way.

The *Wenzi* asked of *Dao/Way*,
and the *Laozi* replied:
*"Learning and inquiry must be precise,
listening to the Way must be profound.
Without learning, one does not know;
without precision, one does not reach.
All who listen seek to attain wisdom,
to perfect action,
or to achieve merit and renown.
Doubt leads to inquiry,
listening demands scrutiny—
like striking a bell,
its resonance must not be hollow.
Only then will there be true benefit
in attaining merit and renown.
Without precision, it remains unclear;
without depth, it is not comprehended.
Thus, the highest learning listens with the *spirit*#1,
scanning the profound without omission.
The middle learning listens with the *heart*,
sometimes retaining, sometimes losing.
The lowest learning listens with the *ears*,
fleeting as the wind passes.
Those who listen with the *ears*
have learning only on the surface,
those who listen with the *heart*
have learning in the sinews,
those who listen with the *spirit*
have learning in the marrow.
Thus, if one’s listening is not profound,
one’s knowledge will be unclear;
if one’s knowledge is unclear,
one cannot exhaust its precision;
if one cannot exhaust its precision,
one’s actions will not be perfected.
The *Dao/Way* and *Virtue/Power* are lofty and wondrous—
if one sees them clearly,
then one’s achievements will stand firm.

The principle of listening is this:
an empty mind, serene and tranquil,
diminished *qi* without excess,
no thought, no concern,
eyes never forgetting their gaze,
ears never heedlessly listening—
concentrating with unwavering focus#1,
internalizing intent fully.
Once obtained, it must be steadfastly held,
enduring forever.
This is the method of *spirit-listening*,
the path to awakening to the Way.
Once obtained, it must be guarded well—
good listeners do not forget,
good embrace#2 does not slip away.

The *Dao/Way* originates from the beginningless;
to listen to its principles, one must first clarify its source.
It begins with *gentleness and yielding*,
yet culminates in *firmness and strength*—
begins with *fewness and smallness*,
yet culminates in *abundance and greatness*.
A ten-encircled tree begins with a sapling,
a hundred-foot-high terrace begins with a foundation.
This is the *Dao/Way* of Heaven.
From non-being to being,
from subtlety to manifestation,
Heaven’s *Dao/Way* is ever thus—
how much more so for humans?

The Sage follows this *Dao/Way*,
and thus the humble *lower themselves*#3,
the retiring *step back*#3,
the frugal *remain modest*#3,
the self-diminishing *keep their numbers few*#3.
By humbling themselves, they are exalted;
by stepping back, they take precedence;
by remaining modest, they grow vast;
by keeping their numbers few, they become great—
this is the *Dao/Way* of Heaven.

Most people exalt themselves while belittling others,
thus losing what others hold dear.
The Sage places others before himself,
thus gaining what others hold dear.
Thus, to oppose the natural order brings no response,
while to align with Heaven brings spontaneous devotion without coercion.

The *Dao/Way* is the source of *virtue/power*,
the root of Heaven,
the gateway to blessings—
all things await it to arise,
await it to flourish,
await it to rest in peace.
The *Dao/Way* is the sovereign of life and transformation,
*virtue/power* is the nourishment for cultivation.
The root of all things must await it to manifest,
the gateway of all blessings must pass through it to unfold.

The *Dao/Way* is actionless and formless,
yet through actionlessness all things arise,
through formlessness all things transform.
Internally, it cultivates the self;
externally, it governs the people—
achievements stand firm,
affairs are established.
In harmony with Heaven,
it does nothing yet accomplishes all.
Cultivating the self, governing the people—
actionless and formless,
in harmony with Heaven,
in unity with the *Dao/Way*,
and thus all is at peace.
None know its essence,
none know its truth—
yet within its depths, faith resides.
Though its substance is not perceptible,
nor its truth recognizable,
yet within its mysterious expanse,
faith is indeed present.

If the *Son of Heaven*#4 has the *Dao/Way*,
then all under Heaven submit,
and he endures with the *altars of soil and grain*#5.
If the *dukes and marquises*#6 have the *Dao/Way*,
then the people are harmonious,
and their states remain unlost.
If the *commoners and scholars*#7 have the *Dao/Way*,
then they preserve their lives,
and safeguard their kin.
From the *Son of Heaven* above
to the commoners below—
all should guard the *Dao/Way*,
secure the state,
harmonize the people,
preserve their lives,
and safeguard their kin.

The strong and mighty with the *Dao/Way*
conquer without battle;
the weak and small with the *Dao/Way*
gain without strife;
undertaking affairs with the *Dao/Way*
brings success and blessings.
Rulers and ministers with the *Dao/Way* are loyal and benevolent,
fathers and sons with the *Dao/Way* are affectionate and filial,
scholars and commoners with the *Dao/Way* love one another—
thus, with the *Dao/Way* there is harmony#2,
without the *Dao/Way* there is harshness.

From this, it is evident:
the *Dao/Way* is fitting for all people.
To practice the *Dao/Way* in small ways brings small blessings,
to practice it in great ways brings great blessings,
to practice it fully brings all under Heaven’s submission—
submission leads to devotion.
All who practice the *Dao/Way*
trace their blessings to its roots.
Thus, the *Emperor*#8 is the fitting destination of all under Heaven,
the *King*#8 is the path all under Heaven follows—
if all under Heaven do not find fitting destination or path,
then one cannot be called *Emperor* or *King*.
This is because they lack the *Dao/Way*—
the people do not come of their own accord.
Though they occupy their positions,
how long can they endure?
Thus, without the people, even *Emperors* and *Kings* cannot succeed—
the state depends on the people,
and a stable foundation ensures lasting peace.
To gain the people yet lose the *Dao/Way*
is also unable to endure.
To have the people but lack the *Dao/Way*
is called an *empty state*.

The greatest crime is to lose the *Dao/Way*,
the deepest grudge is to lose *virtue/power*—
this is the *Dao/Way* of Heaven.
Great crimes and deep grudges
cannot fail to bring ruin to those who hold states,
cannot fail to bring death to those who hold lives—
for their *Dao/Way* is lost,
their *virtue/power* extinguished—
this is Heaven’s reason for their destruction.

The *Laozi* says:
*"Those who practice the *Dao/Way*
make others, though bold,
unable to pierce them with a blade;
though cunning,
unable to strike them.
If they are bold yet do not dare to pierce,
or cunning yet do not dare to strike—
this is better than making them, though bold,
suffer humiliation without fear of piercing,
or though cunning,
suffer scorn without fear of striking.
For those who do not dare to act,
it is not because they lack intent—
but rather to make others lack intent entirely."*

「Thus, those who lack intent
are without hearts of affection or harm—
the *Dao/Way*-practitioner is bold yet unharmed by piercing,
is cunning yet never struck.
Though called harmless,
they are already shamed by the deaf and mocked by the vulgar,
while the extraordinary lies in the *Dao/Way* itself,
and such is termed child’s play.

Better is to make others not even conceive the intent to pierce or strike,
while I hold no affection for gain or harm,
forgetting the artifice of the world—
thus the *Dao/Way* remains whole.

Better still is to make all men and women of the world
willingly embrace love for gain and harm,
as if they were naturally inclined—
for then, without territory, I may be lord,
without office, I may be chief.
All under Heaven willingly seek security and benefit,
and thus the *Regan* (Regan) of *Shi* (Shi) lineage
and the *Sucai* (Sucai) of *Kong* (Kong) family
are but such men.

Thus, boldness in daring brings death,
boldness in not daring brings life.
Boldness in daring leads to ruin,
boldness in not daring ensures survival.

When *Wenzi* (Wenzi) inquired about *virtue/power*,
*Xiang* (Xiang) already knew the *Dao/Way*.
Now he asks again of *virtue/power*,
which includes *ren* (仁) and *yi* (义),
and follows with *li* (礼) and *zhi* (智).
Unless he asks broadly,
how could he grasp the whole?

The *Laozi* says:
*"To nurture and rear,
to fulfill and grow—
comprehensive benefit without discrimination,
aligning with Heaven and Earth—
this is called *virtue/power* (德).
To nurture and complete,
without action or selfishness,
spreading beneficence to all things,
harmonizing with Heaven and Earth—
this is called *ultimate virtue/power* (至德).

What is *ren* (仁)?
It is: when ruling, not boasting of one’s achievements,
when serving, not shaming one’s faults.
Toward the great, not boasting,
toward the small, not deceiving—
comprehensive love without selfishness,
enduring without decay—
this is called *ren* (仁).
Though noble as a Son of Heaven, one does not grow proud,
though lowly as a commoner, one does not fret—
kindness and grace without favor,
broadly bestowing and aiding all—
this is *ren* (仁).

What is *yi* (义)?
It is: when ruling, to support the weak,
when serving, to uphold one’s principles.
When prosperous, not to indulge recklessly,
when in adversity, not to abandon one’s integrity—
one course in accordance with reason,
never perverting or distorting for private gain—
this is called *yi* (义).
To uphold the fallen and rescue the drowning,
to remain steadfast in hardship and guard one’s principles,
to follow what is appropriate and act in accordance with reason—
this is *yi* (义).

What is *li* (礼)?
It is: when ruling, to be reverent and stern,
when serving, to be humble and respectful.
To withdraw and yield, to uphold softness,
to be the feminine complement to the world—
to stand where one does not dare,
to establish where one cannot—
this is called *li* (礼).
To honor and cherish, to comfort those below,
to humble oneself and prioritize others,
to embody the *virtue/power* of modesty and gentleness,
without slackness or arrogance—
this is *li* (礼).

Thus, refining one’s *virtue/power* makes those below obey,
cultivating *ren* (仁) makes those below not contend,
practicing *yi* (义) makes those below fair and upright,
observing *li* (礼) makes those below honor and respect.
When all four are refined,
the state is secure and peaceful.
If any of the four are lacking,
ruling with them brings state collapse,
practicing them brings self-ruin.

Thus, *Dao/Way* is the source of all things,
*virtue/power* is what sustains growth,
*ren* (仁) is what brings love,
*yi* (义) is what brings order,
*li* (礼) is what brings reverence.
When all five are cultivated,
there is none under Heaven who can rival them.

Without nurturing or rearing,
one cannot fulfill growth.
Without kindness or love,
one cannot achieve completion.
Without order or rectification,
one cannot endure long.
Without reverence or esteem,
one cannot attain nobility and worth.
Thus, *virtue/power* is what the people hold dear,
*ren* (仁) is what the people cherish,
*yi* (义) is what the people fear,
*li* (礼) is what the people revere.
These four are the harmonious sequence of *Wenzi* (Wenzi),
the means by which the Sage governs all things.

Possessing these four *virtues/powers*,
one is called a Sage—
thus they can follow Heaven’s will,
and rule all beings.

If a *junzi* (君子) lacks *virtue/power*,
those below will resent them.
If they lack *ren* (仁),
those below will contend.
If they lack *yi* (义),
those below will act violently.
If they lack *li* (礼),
those below will rebel.
When all four are absent,
they are called without *Dao/Way* (无道).
None without *Dao/Way* can endure.

When the *Dao/Way* is hidden,
the four *virtues/powers* are abandoned.
*Wenzi* (Wenzi) inquired of its beginning and end,
and the *Laozi* expounded its gains and losses.
If all four are neglected,
resentment and violence will arise,
contention and disorder must follow—
thus, without *Dao/Way*,
ruin is immediate.

The *Laozi* says:
*"In the age of *ultimate virtue/power*,
merchants find profit in trade,
farmers take joy in the fields,
great officials are content in their duties,
scholars refine their *Dao/Way*,
and the people delight in their work.
Without the transformation of *ultimate virtue/power*,
how could each find joy in their station,
and take delight in their work?
Thus, the winds and rains do not wither or break,
grass and trees do not die young,
the Yellow River bears the *Tuxing* (图) [i.e., *Yijing* (易经) eight trigrams],
the Luo River yields the *Hongfan* (洪范) [i.e., *Shu* (书) Nine Categories].
Only *virtue/power* moves Heaven,
and beneficence touches all things—
this is the Sage’s ultimate governance achieved.

As the age declines,
taxes and levies are without measure,
slaughter and executions know no end,
and those who counsel with punishments
kill the virtuous scholars.
Thus, mountains crumble and rivers dry up,
serpents writhe without rest,
and the wilds lack even a hundred stalks of grain.
The rulers of the *Jiji* (季) age
undermine the fundamental principles,
destroy the traditions,
slay the virtuous and favor the flatterers,
hoard wealth without restraint,
and neglect duties without end.

Defying *qi* and provoking calamity,
their deeds reach Heaven above,
while stars and constellations behave strangely,
and their effects manifest on Earth below—
thus, mountains crumble and rivers run dry,
people have no means to survive,
and all insects and plants lose their proper place.
Only the ruler must be warned against this.

Thus, in times of order,
the foolish cannot act alone in disorder,
and righteousness does not tolerate the crooked.
In times of chaos,
the virtuous cannot rule alone.
Few cannot overcome many.

The Sage is harmonious, joyful, and tranquil—
this is their life.
The *Dao/Way* of *ultimate virtue/power* is realized—
this is their fate.
Thus, life meets fate,
and only then can they act.
Fate is obtained,
and only then can they be clear.
There must be their age,
before there can be their person.

Life meets fate,
and the Sage arises.
The lofty *wudi* (梧) tree naturally draws the *lingfeng* (灵凤),
while the shallow pool cannot contain the great scales.
*Wenzi* (Wenzi) inquired of the Sage’s wisdom,
asking of the Sage and of wisdom.

The *Laozi* says:
*"To hear and know is wisdom (圣);
to see and know is insight (智).
Thus, the Sage always hears where misfortune and fortune originate,
and chooses their *Dao/Way*.
The wise always observe where misfortune and fortune take form,
and choose their actions.
To act when one sees opportunity,
to know difficulty and cease—
The Sage knows the *Dao/Way* of Heaven’s auspicious and inauspicious,
and thus knows where misfortune and fortune originate..."」

The wise see the form before it takes shape,
and thus know the gates of misfortune and fortune.

The Sage discerns Heaven’s auspicious and inauspicious *borrowing and covering* (倚伏),
observing their formlessness before they manifest,
and thus governs before disorder arises.

The wise know misfortune and fortune *leaning against each other*,
and guard against their signs once they appear,
so they do not wander into their gates.

To hear what has not yet emerged—this is the Sage.
To see the form before it takes shape—this is wisdom.
Those who neither hear nor see are truly *qumi* (愚迷).

To hear of what has not yet emerged,
who but the Sage could do so?

To perceive the misfortune already formed,
who but the wise could recognize it?

Without hearing or seeing,
one is indeed *qumi* (愚迷).

The *Laozi* says:
*"If a ruler cherishes *virtue/rightness* (義),
he will trust the times and rely on himself,
abandon the *fate/number* (數) and employ *kindness* (惠).
People act upon the *virtue/rightness* (義) of a single moment,
without considering future calamities,
neglecting the great *Dao/Way*’s *fate/number* (數),
and boasting of clever *kindness* (惠).

This is not the way of an *accomplished ruler* (賢君).
To have vast knowledge yet shallow wisdom,
and to nourish vastness with shallowness—this is impossible.
Pointing to a cup and calling it the sea,
using a short rope to draw deep water—
how could this ever succeed?

To rely solely on one’s wisdom,
one’s failures will surely multiply.
Relying solely on wisdom leads to ruin;
seeking counsel from many yields approval.
Cherishing wisdom exhausts one’s *skills/arts* (術);
cherishing valor is the path to peril and destruction.
To dazzle in what one knows will bring exhaustion and frustration;
to act solely on valor without prudence will invite danger and ruin.

To give freely without fixed measure—
if the upper levels lack fixed measure,
then the lower levels’ expectations will have no end.
If one takes much and gives little,
the people will become his *enemies* (仇).
To take little and give much—
if the *fate/number* (數) is not just,
then giving will be the path to resentment.

In all giving,
one must first take.
To take is to have limits;
to give is to exhaust.
To provide from what is already exhausted
to meet boundless demands—
this is difficult to sustain.

Yet to exchange this with that,
one gains here and loses there.
What if taking is not by the *Dao/Way*,
and giving is not to those who deserve it?
The recipient will not rejoice,
the giver will make an enemy.

Thus, the *virtuous/powerful* (志) Sage abandons the mind of taking and giving,
and upholds the balanced measure.
Where would resentment arise from?

By this, it is clear:
*Wealth* (財) is insufficient to govern the *Dao/Way*,
but the *Dao/Way* and *skills/arts* (術) can be followed for illumination.

Observing the measures of taking and giving,
one sees that they are the source of enmity and resentment.
Thus, when *wealth* (財) cannot save the times,
only the *Dao/Way* can assist the multitudes.

*Wenzi* asked:
*"The ancient kings ruled the world through the *Dao/Way*—
how did they do so?"*

Asking about the *Dao/Way* of the ancient kings,
and admonishing the rulers of their time;
speaking of the present’s flaws,
yet not mentioning the governance of the past—
what should they do?

The *Laozi* said:
*"To hold fast to the One without *action* (為),
and to follow the transformations of Heaven and Earth—
the world is a great vessel.
The sovereigns of antiquity did not rule through *divine wonders*,
but by conforming to Heaven and Earth,
holding fast to the One without *action*,
and harmonizing with the *times* (時).

The world is a great vessel—
it cannot be grasped,
it cannot be made.
To make is to ruin it;
to grasp is to lose it.
The *Dao/Way* is subtle yet formless—
it cannot be grasped;
to grasp is to err.
It is minute yet without fixed shape—
it cannot be made;
to make is to ruin it.

To hold fast to the One is to see the small—
to see the small is to achieve the great.
Only through the One can one govern the multitudes and control things;
only through the great can one see the small without neglect.

To act without *action* is to guard stillness—
to guard stillness is to bring order to the world.
To move without overstepping one’s measure,
to remain still without stagnating—
this is the utmost stillness,
and thus one can bring order to the world.

To dwell in fullness yet not overflow,
to occupy high position yet not be arrogant—
to dwell in fullness without overflowing,
to be full yet not depleted;
to occupy high position without arrogance,
to be elevated yet not perilous.
To be full yet not depleted,
this is how one long guards *wealth* (富);
to be elevated yet not perilous,
this is how one long guards *nobility* (貴).

*Wealth* and *nobility* do not depart from one’s person,
and blessings extend to one’s descendants.
The ancient kings’ *Dao/Way* was complete in this.

To align with the *Dao/Way* of non-*action*,
and to resonate with the ultimate *Dao/Way*—
to dwell in fullness yet not overflow,
to tread in high position yet not be perilous,
to let *virtue/rightness* (德) permeate all things,
and to bestow *virtue/power* (德) upon descendants—
the bright kings of old
all upheld this *Dao/Way* to transform the world."*

The *Laozi* says:
*"The people have a shared *Dao/Way* to follow,
and shared laws to uphold.
*Virtue/Rightness* (義) cannot fix them,
and *authority* (威) cannot compel them.
Thus, a ruler is established to unify them.

In corrupt customs and *thin-hearted* (浇薄) people,
there is no adherence to the *Dao/Way*,
no unity in the laws.
Externally, they adorn themselves with *virtue/rightness* (義) to seek praise,
internally, they wield *authority* (威) to subdue the multitudes.
Without establishing a ruler,
how could they be brought into order?

When the ruler holds fast to the One, governance is achieved;
when there is no constancy, disorder arises.
If the One is unclear,
the ten thousand people lose their foundation.

The ruler’s *Dao/Way* is not about *action*,
but about non-*action*.
The wise do not use *virtue/power* (德) for personal gain,
the brave do not use strength to oppress,
the benevolent do not use their position to bestow favors—
this can be called the One.

Not to choose *idle wanderings* (逍) and act recklessly,
not to rely on one’s position to indulge in *kindness* (惠),
but to preserve all five—
this can be called the One.

The One is the *Dao/Way* of no *adaptation* (適),
the root of all things.
The One is the law.
*Adaptation* means *going* (往).
If the ruler implements the law to govern,
then all things will naturally turn toward the ruler,
and there will be none that do not *adapt*.

If the ruler frequently changes his laws,
the state will frequently change its rulers,
and laws will frequently shift,
while rulers will frequently change.

If the ruler lacks the One,
then the people and things will toil in exhaustion,
and the world will not be at peace.
If the ruler has no fixed laws,
and alters them with each passing time,
then there will be no fixed ruler,
and this will also ruin the people.

By one’s position,
one’s *likes and dislikes* (好惡) are revealed,
while the lower classes fear and tremble,
and cannot be governed.

For all who would be rulers,
it is proper to steady them with *virtue/power* (德) and *Dao/Way*,
and not to indulge in arbitrary *likes and dislikes*.
To indulge their hearts and minds,
to exceed proper *rewards and punishments* (賞罰),
if this is not appropriate,
then the lower officials will tremble in fear,
and fear will lead to excessive *punishments* (刑).
How could this be governed?

Thus, when a ruler loses the One,
his disorder is worse than having no ruler.
The ruler must hold fast to the One,
and only then can the multitudes be united.

The world submits to the ruler above
because the ruler has the *Dao/Way*.
Now, if a state has a ruler yet lacks the *Dao/Way*,
it is as if the people have no master.
Though they have their master,
if *wicked ministers* (奸臣) steal his authority,
and the *virtuous* (賢) suffer harm,
if *taxation* (敛) is excessive without end,
and the people and things labor in suffering—
thus it is said that this is worse than having no ruler."*

此天道也。
*this is the natural order of the cosmos.*

*but followed the reasons behind those laws,*
与化推移。
*adapting them to the changing world.*

道无隆替，而俗有变革，
*The Dao/Way does not wax or wane, yet customs undergo transformation,*
是以五帝不同治，

*below, he aligns with transformation to be among the people.*
上与道交，
*He exchanges with the Dao/Way above,*
下与化游。
*and plays with transformation below.*

「Now wishing to learn their Dao/Way, one cannot attain their pristine clarity and lofty sanctity, nor uphold their legal codes and enact their decrees, and thus will assuredly fail to govern effectively.

Indeed, preserving their classics and implementing their laws and institutions relies upon the pristine clarity and lofty sanctity to expound and guide, so that later scholars may know to honor their guidance, applying it internally to cultivate their own bodies and externally to govern the nation.

When Wenzi asked about politics, he meant: *politics and teaching*.

Laozi said: *Rule them with the Dao/Way, nurture them with virtue/power, do not display your wisdom, do not exert your strength. Teach them with the Dao/Way, yet do not show them your cleverness. Approach them with virtue/power, yet do not flaunt your authority or might. Subtract from excess and hold fast to the singular, so that there is no advantage to be exploited, no desires to be gratified. The essence lies in purity and emptiness; desires and benefits will naturally perish.*

Square yet unsevered, sharp yet not piercing—
*Square yet unsevered,*
*sharp yet not piercing—*
*the upright does not harm things,*
*the sharp does not injure righteousness.*
*Without arrogance, without self-aggrandizement.*

Rule them with the Dao/Way and the people will attach themselves,
Nurture them with virtue/power and they will submit,
Do not display your wisdom and they will suffice,
Do not exert your strength and they will remain sincere.

Do not display your wisdom—*this is frugality*,
Do not exert your strength—*this is restraint*.
Below, he gathers them with generosity,
Above, he takes them with guile.
Frugality preserves himself,
Restraint keeps him secure.

If he does not gather below, they will disperse,
If he does not nurture above, they will rebel,
If he displays his wisdom, they will contend,
If he exerts his strength, they will resent him.
Their dispersion weakens the nation’s might,
Their rebellion leaves the ruler without authority,
Their contention makes virtue/power seem trivial,
Their resentment endangers the ruler’s position.

If these four are truly cultivated—
*frugality, nurturing, wisdom without display, authority without violence—*
then the true Dao/Way is nearly achieved.

Frugal yet self-preserving,
Nurturing to win the people’s affection,
Wise yet not serving self-interest,
Authoritative yet not cruel—
if these four are all cultivated,
then the true Dao/Way is preserved.

Laozi said: *The words spoken above are used below, the words spoken below are used above. The words spoken above are constant usage, the words spoken below are expedient usage.* Only the sage can know how to use expedient measures, speaking yet always trustworthy, setting terms yet always meeting them. Above, the sage speaks of the Dao/Way; below, he employs expedient measures. Only the sage can know how to use them without losing the Dao/Way, skillfully applying expedient measures.

The petty man uses them and loses his life—
*he does not understand expedient measures.*
Only expedient measures are trustworthy without words,
and meet expectations without prior agreement.

What is the highest conduct in the world?
*To be upright yet honor one’s father,*
*to be trustworthy yet die for one’s daughter—*
who could value such things?

The world knows that honoring one’s father is wisdom,
dying for one’s daughter is trustworthiness,
yet none can truly esteem them.
This is not so.
To force one’s nature for uprightness,
to restrain conduct for sincerity—
these are but the deceptive methods of the end times,
not the true intent of supreme virtue/power.
Thus, they are not worthy of honor or trust.

Therefore, the sage judges matters as crooked or straight,
bending or extending with others,
without fixed forms or appearances,
adjusting to the occasion.
If a ruler is praised as virtuous yet drowned,
or a father reviled as cruel yet buried,
this is due to circumstances alone.
*"Drowned"* is pronounced *nà* (祚骨切).
A ruler praised as virtuous is not so by nature—
*only when praised does he seem virtuous*,
*a father reviled as cruel is not so by nature—*
*only when drowned does he seem acceptable*.
Circumstances dictate the event—
who claims that this is fitting to propriety?

Expedient measures are what the sage alone understands.
*To first oppose then later conform*—
this is called expedient measures.
To first conform then oppose—
this is not to understand expedient measures,
and not to understand them is to invite disaster.

The skilled user of expedient measures—
*first deceptive, then enlightening*.
The unskilled user—
*begins fortunate, ends calamitous*.

Wenzi asked: *Master, without virtue/power and the Dao/Way, one cannot govern the world. The rulers of antiquity, inheriting their predecessors’ achievements, also had those without the Dao/Way yet did not suffer ruin or defeat. How could this be?*

Laozi replied: *From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, each lives as they will. Yet their vitality differs in measure—some flourish, others decline. When nations fall and families break, it is not due to external calamity but to losing the Dao/Way.*

If virtue/power and the Dao/Way exist,
then day and night one remains vigilant,
ever fearful of peril and ruin.
If they do not exist,
then desires run wild and laziness prevails—
their ruin comes without warning.

To dwell as though already ruined is to leave no remnant of calamity for the nation.
To rest in safety and forget danger is to court death at any moment.
If Jie and Zhou followed the Dao/Way and practiced virtue/power,
even if Tang and Wu were wise,
they could not have established their achievements.
With the Dao/Way, one becomes king;
without it, one faces ruin.
It is known that good and evil do not determine kingship.
The rise or fall lies with the people—
the August Heaven aids virtue/power,
this is the natural order.
How could it be otherwise?

Virtue/power and the Dao/Way are what nurtures and sustains life,
what fosters growth and affection,
what inspires reverence and esteem.
Even the deaf worm and blind turtle,
though lacking ears,
do not harm what they love.
If all under heaven harbored hearts of benevolence and righteousness,
how could calamity and disaster arise?

The Dao/Way is vast and encompassing,
thick and heavy—
it gives life, sustains it,
nurtures it, loves it,
without distinction among things,
fully extending itself to all.
If all things were thus,
even the deaf worm’s stupidity would feel the grace of benevolence—
why fear the rise of calamity and disaster?

Without the Dao/Way yet free from harm—
this is because benevolence has not yet been extinguished
and righteousness has not yet perished.
Though benevolence may linger
and righteousness not yet vanish,
the feudal lords will already scorn their ruler.
When feudal lords scorn their ruler,
the court will not show proper respect,
even if they do not openly defy him.

If a king lacks the Dao/Way,
yet his lineage and position remain unbroken,
it is because benevolence and righteousness still linger.
Yet the seeds of misfortune and calamity have already taken root here—
the people’s resentment toward their ruler has begun.
Thus, the ruler of Qi descends from his hall to meet the feudal lords,
and the Duke of Jin convenes alliances at the borderlands—
these are signs of a declining age.

When benevolence is extinguished and righteousness perishes,
the feudal lords rebel,
and the common people seize power through force and coercion.
The strong oppress the weak,
the great encroach upon the small—
the people take up arms as their livelihood.
Disasters multiply,
calamities arise—
their ruin is inevitable.
Why speak of being free from misfortune?»

「When the Dao/Way is lost and virtue/power extinguished,
when benevolence is extinguished and righteousness perishes,
there are rulers who are not true rulers,
and ministers who are not true ministers.
Superior and inferior lose their proper stations,
the strong oppress the weak—
thus the Second Emperor of Qin and the later sovereigns of Han,
these are the times when states are destroyed and perish.

Laozi says:
*"When laws are intricate and punishments severe,
the people will resort to deceit.
When laws are intricate, they cannot be fully followed,
and when they are not fully followed,
one enforces severity through punishments—
but when punishments are not just,
the innocent are ensnared in guilt."*

Thus, the common people grow reckless, risking death to defy the law,
and the peril of the world arises from this.
The more the ruler acts, the more the subjects rebel;
the more he seeks, the less he attains;
the more he prohibits, the fewer obey.
He creates troubles through his actions,
yet seeks to suppress them through further actions—
this is like fanning flames to extinguish them;
using wisdom to breed calamity,
then using wisdom to defend against it—
like stirring water to seek its clarity.

When people are burdened with many affairs, their hearts grow restless,
and when a state enforces many prohibitions, its people grow weary—
just as fire cannot be quenched by constant fanning,
nor water purified by repeated stirring.

Laozi says:
*"If a ruler favors benevolence,
he rewards those without merit
and pardons those with crimes.
If he favors severity,
he discards those with merit
and punishes the innocent.
Without fixed preferences,
he executes without resentment,
and gives without expecting virtue in return.
When a ruler has no fixed preferences,
his ministers face no unjust punishments,
those rewarded do not avoid their fate,
and those executed hold no grudges.
He follows the square and the plumb line,
uninvolved in affairs,
like Heaven and Earth—
why should they not sustain and cover all?"*

When he unites and harmonizes, he is the ruler;
when he separates and punishes, he is the law.
If the people are punished without complaint,
this is called virtue/power and Dao/Way.

Actions follow law and measure,
virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth—
when the ruler is enlightened, principles are never obscured,
and when the law is just, the people suffer no wrongful fate.

Laozi says:
*"The world’s judgments of right and wrong are not fixed;
each age upholds what it deems good
and rejects what it deems evil.
Those who seek what is right
do not seek the Dao/Way,
but what aligns with themselves.
Those who reject what is wrong
do not reject evil,
but what contradicts their hearts.
If I wish to choose what is right and dwell in it,
or reject what is wrong and discard it,
I do not know what the world calls right and wrong.

The world’s people praise what I uphold as right,
and condemn what I reject as wrong;
they also condemn what I praise as good,
and reject what I uphold as right.
If what I uphold is not truly right,
and what I praise as good is not truly good,
then good and evil are undefined,
and right and wrong are nowhere to be found.
Yet those who satisfy their own desires,
though they condemn, still consider it good,
and though they praise what is good,
they do not abandon decay.
What they reject as wrong
is what contradicts their own hearts—
thus, there is no right without wrong,
and no wrong without right.
There is no good without evil,
nor evil without good—
so the enlightened do not fixate on good and evil,
nor on right and wrong.
Thus, they govern great states like simmering a delicate broth—
do not stir it, lest it spoil.
Great states cannot endure chaotic governance?
Delicate broths cannot bear repeated stirring?
Those who seek harmony
must speak truthfully to foster closeness,
yet when their bodies are distant and they plot,
they invite suspicion.
Seeking harmony means aligning with the ruler’s favor.
If their words are truthful yet their bodies are distant,
the ruler will not fully trust them,
and they will surely be suspected.
Now I wish to uphold my integrity
and await the world’s response—
how can I know what the world will use to measure me?
If I rush to conform with the world,
I am like one fleeing rain without shelter—
yet still, I am drenched.
Now I wish to be the world’s measure and model,
yet others will also make me their teacher and guide—
like one sprinting to avoid rain,
exhausted and labored,
yet still unable to escape being wet.
To dwell in emptiness is impossible,
unless one does not seek emptiness and yet emptiness comes naturally—
this is how desires are fulfilled without effort.
Emptiness is without desire;
desire is not emptiness.
Without the heart’s attachment,
one attains all things.

Thus, those who grasp the Dao/Way
are like a cart’s axle that does not turn for itself,
yet enables the wheel to reach a thousand miles,
turning endlessly on the boundless plain.
The adept of the Dao/Way
is the hub of the cart—
his body mingles with the world yet finds rest,
his spirit dwells in the center yet remains ever still.
He does not stray beyond words,
nor toil for himself—
thus he turns upon boundless paths,
and wanders in realms of utter darkness.
Therefore, the sage embodies the Dao/Way and returns to its source,
does not transform to await transformation,
and acts without contrivance.

The sage internally returns to truth,
externally adapts to change,
touched by emotions yet unstained—
he moves and acts without contrivance.

Laozi says:
*"He who often wages war and frequently wins
will surely bring his state to ruin.
Frequent warfare exhausts the people,
frequent victories breed arrogance in the ruler—
with an arrogant ruler governing exhausted subjects,
how few states can avoid ruin?
Arrogance leads to excess,
excess leads to depletion of resources,
exhaustion breeds resentment,
resentment leads to extreme measures—
when both ruler and subjects reach extremes,
no state remains unfallen."*

Thus, when achievements are complete, the sage withdraws—
this is the Dao/Way of Heaven.
War should not be waged often,
the ruler should not grow arrogant,
the people should not be exhausted,
resources should not be depleted—
for when extremes are reached,
they return to extremes without ruin.
When King Ping asked Wenzi:
*"I have heard that you attained the Dao/Way from Lao Dan.
Now, though wise men may possess the Dao/Way,
they face a depraved and chaotic age—
with the authority of one man alone,
how can he transform the long-suffering people?
Is this possible?"*
King Ping refers to the Zhou King Ping.
The "one man" speaks of the king himself.
Wenzi, the wise man, is the speaker here—
*"Though the Dao/Way of virtue/power
rectifies evil to establish order,
restores chaos to bring governance,
and transforms depravity to return to simplicity,
pure virtue revives,
and the world attains peace—
this depends on one man.
For righteousness resides in the heart,
and governance stems from the ruler.
When the heart weakens, decay follows;
when the ruler governs rightly, order prevails.
Thus, prosperity and decline are not decreed by Heaven,
success and failure rest within ourselves—
they do not depend on external things,
but on the Dao/Way we uphold.
The value lies in the Dao/Way."*

The Dao/Way rests with one man,
then licentious customs may be transformed,
pure virtue revived—
what cause for worry that governance will fail?

The sovereign is the people’s teacher,
the ruler, their model.
When the ruler is virtuous, the people follow;
when the ruler possesses virtue/power,
the people cultivate benevolence and righteousness,
and thus there is no age of licentious chaos.

Hence, all under Heaven, bright and clear,
take the ruler as their teacher,
look to him as their model—
as water from a thousand-fathom gorge
must flow downward, so too do all turn to him.

Accumulate virtue/power and become a sage-king,
accumulate resentment and court ruin,
accumulate stones and mountains rise,
accumulate water and seas form—
nothing great is achieved without accumulation.
Virtue unaccumulated is insufficient to earn renown,
evil unaccumulated is insufficient to destroy oneself.
Thus, the sage-king follows what is accumulated.

He who accumulates virtue/power
receives Heaven’s favor,
gains Earth’s assistance,
and is aided by spirits and gods—
phoenixes soar in his courtyard,
qilin roam his suburbs,
and dragons repose in his ponds.
Thus, by accumulating virtue/power,
he moves Heaven and Earth,
and the four spirits manifest auspicious signs,
while all things rejoice in their proper roles.

To govern under Heaven with the Dao/Way
is the virtue/power of the world;
to govern under Heaven without the Dao/Way
is the world’s ruin.
To set oneself against the world as an enemy,
even if one seeks longevity, it cannot be attained.

*Governing* (莅) means to preside over.
When the ruler governs under Heaven with the Dao/Way,
the world willingly bears him without burden.
When one governs without the Dao/Way,
the world resents him and his rule does not endure.

Emperor Yao and Shun flourished through this,
while Jie and Zhou perished by it.
Observe the good and the evil
to discern survival and ruin.

King Ping said: "Your servant reverently obeys."
King Ping, a virtuous ruler of Zhou,
grieved over the decline of the Dao/Way in his age,
and thus questioned Wenzi,
seeking the path to governance.

Wenzi replied: "It depends on one man,
not on others."
Thus, King Ping refined his governance,
and the Zhou Dao/Way revived,
earning praise in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*,
and later historians honored him as King Ping.

*End of Volume Five of the Treatise on Penetrating the Mysterious and True*
*Volume Six begins: The Silent Child’s Commentary*

The **Supreme Virtue/Power**—The **Supreme Virtue/Power** refers to the virtuous rulers of their time. When the Dao/Way of the Three Dynasties declined and the virtue/power of the Five Hegemons waned, it was fitting to cultivate virtue/power to rectify the world. Those with virtue/power are honored, and those with merit are praised, hence the term **Supreme Virtue/Power**.

Laozi said: *"The ruler is the heart of the state; a tranquil heart brings order to all limbs, while a disturbed heart brings chaos."* Governing the state depends on the ruler’s clarity—when he is clear, all the people take joy in their pursuits. Governing oneself depends on a rectified heart—when it is rectified, all limbs find their proper place. Thus, when a man’s self is well-governed, his limbs move without effort; he knows no sickness or pain. When a state is well-governed, its ruler and ministers forget each other; there is no worry or anxiety.

Laozi said: *"He learned from Master Changzhu [常枞]—Laozi’s teacher, surnamed Chang, named Zhu."* Laozi himself recounted receiving instruction from his teacher, whose words were thus: *"The unlettered one—when he sees the tongue, he guards softness; when he sees the ancient Dao/Way, he upholds the yielding and gentle."* The ancient character (古) can also be written as the tongue character (舌), meaning softness. Gazing upward at the house beams, he laments that light does not linger. Retreating by the river, he sighs that the past does not cease flowing. Observing shadows to know how to grasp what comes after, he does not act before its time.

Thus, the Sage follows the Way of **emptiness and non-action**, always yielding to what comes later rather than forcing what comes first. It is like kindling a pile of wood—when the fire reaches the top, the lower logs are consumed. What comes later is what comes first; what is below is what is above. This is the natural order of things. If one seeks to act before others, he cannot act before others.

Laozi said: *"The clapper of a bell, though loud, destroys itself; the candle, though bright, consumes itself. The markings of tigers and leopards invite arrows; the swiftness of monkeys and gibbons invites traps. Thus, the bold perish by their strength; the eloquent are ensnared by their cleverness. Though one knows cleverness, he cannot know when to refrain from it."* This is the harm of knowing, the inability to preserve oneself by not knowing. Though one is wise in speech, he can only be given partial truths, not broad responses. Holding to the courage of an ordinary man, he cannot defend against multitudes; clinging to one-sided arguments, he does not speak of universal principles.

Laozi said: *"The Dao/Way is founded on non-existence; to embody the Dao/Way is to be empty and without form—this is called **subtle and mysterious**."* It cannot be seen in form, nor heard in sound; this is called **profound and dark**. **Profound and dark** describes the Dao/Way, yet is not the Dao/Way itself. It is like a net—used to catch fish, yet not the fish itself; or words—used to speak of the Dao/Way, yet not the Dao/Way itself.

The Dao/Way is to look inward and reflect; to listen within and reflect, thus attaining self-knowledge. Therefore, a man is neither slightly awakened nor deeply confused; neither slightly kind nor greatly foolish. He who clutches a glowworm and compares it to the sun is not confused how? He who holds a piece of jade and compares it to the King of Fu is not foolish how?

Do not take your mirror from flowing water, but from still water, for its stillness preserves within and does not sway without. Dust in the heart scatters outward—it flows and forever dims. Water’s nature is inward emptiness—its stillness reflects itself. The moon wanes when the sun shines; darkness cannot endure against light. Stars vanish when the sun rises—nothing can contend with its radiance. The end cannot be stronger than the root; branches cannot surpass the trunk. When the upper is heavy and the lower is light, its fall is inevitable.

This means: the Great Ruler has his decree, the lesser men should not presume to act. If they do, it is like darkness seizing light or stars challenging the sun—root and branch must be used in harmony, each in its proper place, to avoid peril and overthrow.

One pool does not nurture two dragons; one female does not mate with two males. Unity is fixed; duality invites contention. When the ruler is unified, the state is secure. When a man is unified, his heart is at peace. Jade rests in the mountain, and grass and trees grow moist. Pearls arise from the depths, and the shore does not wither. Mountains and rivers hold jade and pearls, thus nourished and graceful. The gentleman accumulates virtue/power, thus radiant and illustrious.

The earthworm lacks the strength of sinews and bones nor the sharpness of claws and teeth, yet it feeds above on the soil and drinks below from the Yellow Spring—its heart is unified. The earthworm eats when hungry and drinks when thirsty—no conflicting thoughts, no need for sinews, bones, claws, or teeth. When a man unifies his heart in the Dao/Way, why should he rely on fame and profit to find satisfaction?

Clarity is brightness—even a cup of water reveals the pupil. Turbidity is harm—a river cannot obscure a great mountain. Though clarity is small, it can discern the finest hairs; though turbidity is vast, it cannot reveal peaks and valleys. Orchids and sweetgrass do not cease their fragrance because they are not worn; a boat floats on the rivers and seas, not sinking because it is not boarded; the gentleman follows the good Dao/Way, not stopping because it is unrecognized—this is their inherent nature.

Orchids and sweetgrass are fragrant by nature; they cannot help but be fragrant. The gentleman follows the good Dao/Way—he cannot but act. To bring clarity into turbidity is to invite suffering; to bring turbidity into clarity is to invite ruin. The virtuous and foolish cannot stand together; purity and filth do not mix in the same vessel. Heaven’s two *qi* forms the rainbow; Earth’s two *qi* causes leakage and concealment; man’s two *qi* brings illness. The three transformations of Heaven, Earth, and Man value life above all.

Darkness and light cannot remain constant—winter follows summer, and summer follows winter. The moon does not know day; the sun does not know

The gentleman who is attuned to the Dao/Way is like a cart axle turning within its hub, not moving by itself, yet reaching a thousand *li*—its motion endless, returning yet beginning anew. This has already been explained.

Thus, when raising the crooked and the straight, one may not always succeed; when raising the straight and the crooked, do not force it to proceed.
This is to elucidate the *Fu* and *Yan* sections.

When a bird is about to come, setting nets and waiting for it—he who catches the bird gains one eye of the net. If one makes a net of a single eye, he will never catch a bird.
Relying on one man’s talent alone is hard to govern the multitude.
A net of a single eye cannot trap a bird.
Thus, some matters cannot be preordained, some things cannot be foreseen—
therefore the Sage stores the Dao/Way and awaits the proper time.

The Sage’s conduct is Heavenly, his actions follow the times;
before the time arrives, he guards the Dao/Way—when the time comes, he acts accordingly.
The Duke of Zhou’s establishment of the Zhou Dao, and the Emperor Gaozu’s flourishing of the Han dynasty.

To gain fish, one must first open the valleys;
to attract birds, one must first plant the trees.
Water gathers, and fish assemble;
trees flourish, and birds congregate.
He who gains fish does not drag them into the depths—
he who gains monkeys does not carry them up the trees.
He merely lets them go where it is advantageous.

The relationship between ruler and subject is like fish returning to water,
birds relying on forests—
letting them act as they will, they come without being summoned.
A wise ruler governs, and loyal and virtuous ministers naturally arrive.

The foot treads shallow ground, yet waits for what it cannot tread before it can move;
the mind knows little, yet waits for what it does not know before it can be enlightened.
The foot’s familiar ground is little, its unfamiliar ground is much.
The mind’s known things are few, its unknown things are many.
Thus, though he does not act, his actions are fulfilled;
though he does not know, his knowledge is complete.

When streams run dry, the valleys become empty;
when hills are leveled, the depths are sealed.
When lips are lost, teeth grow cold;
when the Yellow River is deep, its nourishment lies in the mountains.
This illustrates how the ruler and people rely on each other,
just as mountains and rivers are interconnected.
A deep Yellow River brings fertility to the mountains,
a ruler’s heavy taxation drains the people’s wealth.
When the ruler demands more, the people are exhausted;
when the people’s strength is spent, the ruler’s position is perilous—
this is the meaning of "lips lost, teeth grow cold."

Water still yields clarity;
clarity brings evenness;
evenness brings ease;
ease reveals the form of things.
Forms cannot coexist—
thus clarity can be used as a standard.
When the sovereign’s wisdom is established,
it is like the stillness of water.
Deeply discerning the nature of things,
no state of good or evil escapes him;
profoundly observing human nature,
his policies of peace and harmony spread naturally.

When leaves fall, it is the wind that shakes them;
when water becomes turbid, it is objects that stir it.
The wind does not shake yet leaves fall,
objects always stir yet water remains clear—this has never been seen.
The *Bi* and *Zhuó* vessels are refined by the *Chuàn* and *Zhuàn* processes;
the *Léng* and *Zhuó* blades are honed by *dǐlì* and *lìlì*.
Though jade and fine swords possess beautiful qualities,
they must rely on the *dǐlì* and *lìlì* processes
to become extraordinary tools.
The gentleman and the virtuous man,
though possessing talent and innate qualities,
must rely on teachers and mentors
to perfect their undertakings.

The *Fènghuáng* soars at heights of a thousand *rèn*—
none can summon it.
The *Zhuī* is fixed within a hundred layers—
yet it cannot rise by itself.
Ascend the heights, and they become mountains;
descend the depths, and they become abysses.
Act upon what is easy, and men achieve without labor;
exploit what is familiar, and things come without being called.

Ditches and ponds overflow in floods,
dry up in droughts—
but the sources of the Yellow River and the seas,
deep and inexhaustible, do not fail.
Store them, and they do not brim;
let them flow, and they do not run dry—
never have I heard of woes from overflow or drought,
for their depths are ever thus.

The tortoise has no ears, yet its eyes cannot be covered—
it is keen in sight.
The blind man has no eyes, yet his ears cannot be covered—
he is keen in hearing.

The *Fènghuáng* returns to its native land,
the hare flees back to its burrow,
the fox dies with its head toward its hill,
the cicada finds refuge in the trees—
each returns to its origin.

Things do not forget their roots,
but men sometimes stray from the Dao/Way.
Water and fire repel each other,
yet the *Dǐng* and *Lì* vessels exist between them,
and the five flavors are harmonized.
Bone and flesh love each other,
yet slanderers come between them,
and father and son grow suspicious.
This shows how things have opposing natures—
though water and fire attack each other,
when used properly, they yield harmony.
Though bone and flesh love each other,
slander and deceit come between them,
and doubt arises.
The virtuous must be vigilant.

Dogs and pigs eat without discrimination,
growing fat in body,
yet they are near death.
This illustrates how the petty man seeks fame and profit in haste—
though he may prosper temporarily, he will ultimately fail.
The virtuous man stores the Dao/Way and awaits the proper time—
though he may suffer temporarily, he will ultimately thrive.

The *Fènghuáng* soars at heights of a thousand *rèn*—
none can summon it;
the *Zhuī* is fixed within a hundred layers—
yet it cannot rise by itself.
Ascend the heights, and they become mountains;
descend the depths, and they become abysses.
Act upon what is easy, and men achieve without labor;
exploit what is familiar, and things come without being called.

Ditches and ponds overflow in floods,
dry up in droughts—
but the sources of the Yellow River and the seas,
deep and inexhaustible, do not fail.
Store them, and they do not brim;

never have I heard of woes from overflow or drought,

「Each draws benefit from its own source, yet none can borrow from another’s.
The *húnhún* waters are turbid—
can they wash my feet?
The *línglíng* waters are clear—
can they rinse my *yīng*?

To speak of purity and turbidity without omission,
the wise and the foolish are both employed—
but measure their capacity and assign tasks accordingly,
and adapt to circumstances as they arise.

**Yào** (药) serves as *gǎo* (缟),
or as a *guān* (冠),
or as a *yǔ* (豓).
**Wèi** (未) indicates
that its use is not fixed.

When used as a *guān* (冠),
it adorns the head;
when used as a *yǔ* (豓),
it graces the feet.
Do not violate its proper function,
but fulfill its essential role.

Gold’s power surpasses wood—
a single blade cannot harm an entire forest;
earth’s power surpasses water—
a single scoop cannot dam a river;
water’s power surpasses fire—
a single sip cannot quench a cartload of kindling.

To straighten one man’s crookedness
cannot alter the multitude’s perversity,
to enlighten one man’s ignorance
cannot dispel the confusion of the crowd.

Winter has thunder, summer has hail—
the seasons do not change their course,
yet frost and snow fall *chōuchuò* (麃麃),
and the *yìlù* (义鹿) dies in the fifth month.
The *chánchú* (蟾蜍) avoids *bì* (辟) weapons,
and its lifespan lasts until the fifth month’s full moon.

These all have utility yet suffer harm—
why not remain nameless to preserve one’s self?
The *chánchú* (蟾蜍) is said to be slain in the fifth month,
but when its flesh is smeared with the five weapons,
it enters battle unscathed.

Those whose *jīng* (精) is dissipated fall prey to misfortune.
The *jīnghuá* (精华) emanates from within,
while the branches and trunks wither from without.

The *huá* (华) that blooms untimely cannot be eaten.
To consume things out of season brings illness,
to take wealth without righteousness invites ruin.

Between tongue and teeth,
which wears out first?
Between cord and arrow,
which bends first?

Though the rigid may be firm, they inevitably fail,
though the yielding may bend, they rectify what is amiss.
A crooked shadow betrays its form,
a muddled echo betrays its voice.

A straight form will never cast a crooked shadow,
a virtuous word will never yield a foul echo.

To treat one whose illness is fatal as if it were not,
is difficult for even the finest physician.
To counsel one whose kingdom is doomed as if it were not,
is impossible for even the most loyal minister.

A fatal illness cannot be cured,
even by the best physician.
A doomed kingdom cannot be saved,
even by the most loyal minister.

When the *chāng* (倡) plays the *yǒu* (竽),
and the craftsman adjusts the *quǎn* (窍),
though the rhythm may be correct,
they cannot make it resound—
the master’s prestige is lost.

The *chāng* (倡) is the one who plays the *yǒu* (竽),
the craftsman is the one who adjusts the *quǎn* (窍).
Though the notes may fit the scale,
their actions ultimately conflict with purpose—
the heart does not respond,
so how can they achieve harmony?
This illustrates how the master’s authority is forgotten.

The deaf cannot sing to find their own joy,
the blind cannot gaze to engage with the world.
Sound does not reach their ears,
so they abandon all thought of music,
and sight does not reach their eyes,
so they cease all contemplation of beauty.

Walking through forests, one cannot follow straight paths,
traversing perilous terrain, one cannot measure with a plumb line.
To walk through forests, one seeks only to pass through,
to traverse dangers, one seeks only to rescue the lost.

The sea’s greatness lies in its abundance—
it is vast because it does not cease to give birth,
and boundless because its use never ends.

The sun does not rise twice in one day,
the fox does not have two masters,
the divine dragon does not pair,
the fierce beasts do not gather in groups,
and startled birds do not fly in twos.

These all stand alone, unpaired—
thus they become the leaders of all beasts and birds.
It is not the whisk that obscures the sun,
nor the spokes that follow swiftness—
one must rely on the proper tools.

To draw a bow and shoot,
one cannot release the arrow without the string,
and only one in ten shots strikes true.
Though the bow may be strong,
without the string, it cannot hit the mark.
Though a ruler may be sage,
without ministers, his deeds cannot be completed.

Among those who seek office,
many are unworthy—
yet among those who seek virtue,
only one in ten thousand is found.

A hungry horse in the stable
remains silent and still,
but when fed grain beside it,
it immediately becomes restless.

When one lacks fodder in the stable,
it is given and they will contend.
When one craves fame and position,
but dwells in them, they will strive—
thus the noble man yields his fortune,
while the petty man competes for rank.

A three-*cùn* (寸) tube, though open,
cannot fill the world,
yet a ten-*dàn* (石) vessel has its limits,
and a hundred *dòu* (斗) measure is sufficient.

This illustrates how the greedy never have enough,
though their vessels are bottomless.

To follow the plumb line and cut—
it will not go astray,
to suspend the balance and weigh—
it will not err.
To apply ancient principles by analogy,
there are times when they succeed,
and to wield the *gè* (格) rod,
there are times when it is appropriate.
To act thus is called *duàn* (断, "decision"),
to act otherwise is called *luàn* (乱, "chaos").

Following the plumb line in action,
things cannot exceed its measure,
suspending the balance in governance,
no matter goes unaddressed.

Since ancient and modern times differ,
laws and measures must also vary—
adapting to the times brings order,
clinging to the past brings ruin.

The farmer toils while the nobleman is nourished,
the foolish speak while the wise deliberate.

When matters are clear,
treat them like jade or stone—
no doubt remains.
When understanding is murky,
leave room for counsel.

A hundred stars’ brightness
does not match the moon’s single light,
ten windows fully opened
do not match the clarity of one.
Though petty men may be many,
they are insufficient to rely upon,
though virtuous men may be few,
one is more than enough.

King Wen secured Lü Wang (吕望),
Emperor Gaozu secured Zi Fang (子房)—
were they few in number?

The *fùshé* (蝮蛇) cannot be a foot,
nor the tiger’s a wing.
No man is fully capable,
no thing possesses dual perfection.»

The six-foot mat—
when lying upon it, even the lowly may cross it with ease,
but standing to step over it, even the gifted find it difficult.
Different circumstances demand different efforts.

Men’s talents vary—
what suits one may fail another,
for their abilities differ.

The assistant at sacrifice gains a taste,
the one who breaks up a fight takes a wound.
Seeing goodness brings blessing,
encountering evil brings harm—
how much more so when one acts personally?

Sheltering beneath an ill-omened tree,
one is struck by thunder.
Hiding beneath an ill-omened tree,
yet the heavenly wrath cannot be evaded;
concealing a wicked man,
yet the state’s law will surely punish.

The sun and moon wish to shine,
but floating clouds obscure them;
the river longs to be clear,
but sand and silt defile it;
clusters of orchids strive to flourish,
but autumn winds wither them;
human nature seeks balance,
yet desires corrupt it.
Covered in dust yet hoping for purity—
it cannot be achieved.

Dwelling in murky darkness,
how can one perceive brightness?
Residing in the field of desires,
one must follow their stain.

Frost and hail descend together,
and orchids cannot preserve their fragrance;
sandy soil flows with mud,
and the river’s source cannot retain its purity.

Yellow gold and tortoiseshell,
the virtuous wear as ornaments;
common earth and clay,
the capable use for wealth.
If one does not know their proper use,
even gold and jade become worthless as dung.
If one knows how to apply them,
even earth and clay become priceless as pearls.

Thus, giving gold and jade to the weak
is not as good as giving them writing paper.
*Weak* refers to the foolish and feeble.
Giving them paper may still be preserved,
but giving them gold and jade will bring harm—
just as placing a petty man in high office
will surely bring danger and ruin.

A hub holds thirty spokes,
each pulling straight toward its own slot,
yet none can enter another’s place—
just as ministers each hold their own duties.
The meaning does not differ from the earlier explanation.

The skilled user of men
is like the *xiān*’s foot—
many yet causing no harm,
like the tongue and teeth,
firm and soft grinding together without destruction.
*The xiān* is the centipede.
Those who skillfully employ many
are like the centipede, are they not?
The tongue and teeth,
hard and soft working together,
gather both the wise and foolish.
Let each follow its proper place,
and their talents will not be wasted.

Stone is born firm,
orchids are born fragrant—
if possessed in youth, their virtue grows clearer with age.
This is their inherent nature:
stone is firm, orchids are fragrant,
because the virtuous become ever clearer,
while the foolish grow ever dimmer.
Thus, firmness and fragrance cannot be taken away,
nor can foolishness and darkness be moved—
those who possess them in youth
see them only deepen with time.

Supporting and lifting,
declining and yielding,
gaining and losing,
agreeing and refusing—
these differ as heaven and earth.
How can they be the same?

Twice-born plants bear no fruit,
those that bloom too early fall before frost.
Double-honored yet barren,
the sun at its peak scorches its own standard,
dusting its brow—
the standard is the nose.
A nose stained with dust while its forehead is powdered—
like treating a hand’s ailment while neglecting the foot.
This is most unnatural.

A rotting rat in the ancestral hall,
its stench burning the hall’s beams—
plunging into water only to grow more drenched,
clutching foulness while seeking fragrance—
even the skilled cannot remedy it.
*The rotting rat* is like the deceitful and flattering.
The ruler who favors such men while seeking good governance
is like one drowning in water or burning the hall—
the calamity will not be small.

Winter ice can be broken,
summer wood can be knotted—
opportune moments are hard to find yet easy to lose.
Time is precious, fate fleeting—
warn the virtuous to act when the moment comes,
lest they lose it.

Wood in full growth may be cut all day and regrow,
but when autumn frost descends,
it withers in a single night.
Those who build merit and achieve great deeds
must not delay.

A bowstring drawn tight while arrows gather,
trees lush while axes enter—
not summoned, yet they come.
The bowstring does not seek to strike yet the arrows gather,
the forest does not call for felling yet the axes arrive—
this is the work of natural forces.

A suckling pup bites a tiger,
a crouching chicken strikes a weasel—
favor bestowed does not measure their strength.
Yet those who nurture such favor
will forget their own lives.

Those who wait for profit to rescue the drowning
will surely drown them with their own greed.

A boat can float or sink—
the foolish do not know where to place their trust.

The vessel rides upon the water and may also sink it.
Man thrives by advantage yet may also be drowned by it.
Only by discerning the measure of sufficiency
may one avoid the calamity of sinking.

A fine steed urged forward does not advance,
pulled back does not halt—
a ruler does not seek the Dao of distance.

The people are exhausted to their limits,
yet the sovereign’s greed knows no end;
a weary steed is driven further—
how can one chart a distant path?

Water, though level, must have ripples,
a balance, though true, must have deviation,
a ruler’s measure, though uniform, must have flaws.

Without the compass and square, one cannot define the square and round;
without the plumb and level, one cannot rectify the crooked and straight.
Yet those who wield the compass and square
also bear the mind of the compass and square.

When the sovereign establishes just and upright laws,
yet the people give rise to perverse and rebellious factions,
it is as though ripples arise from level water,
or a crooked mind stems from the upright balance—
the seeds of favor and aversion take root,
and the signs of chaos unfold.
It is not that the sovereign lacks laws and regulations,
but that the subjects have lost their compass and square.

The grandeur of Tai Mountain, though doubled, is unseen,
yet the tip of an autumn hair, though minute, may be discerned.
When one’s gaze is fixed upon the autumn hair,
though small, it may be perceived—
but when one’s path turns away from Tai Mountain,
though vast, it remains unseen.

The bamboo and wood, when struck by fire, do not ignite unless pierced or scorched;
The earth holds water within, yet without digging, it does not emerge.
Wood is concealed within fire, earth within water—
Without piercing or digging, they cannot be revealed.

The Dao resides within humanity—
Without study, it remains unknown.
An arrow’s swiftness does not exceed two *li*,
Yet with each halting step, the tortoise reaches a thousand *li*.
Accumulated grains, though small, form hills and mountains.

For those who seek the Way,
It is not the speed of their initial resolve that matters,
Nor the beauty of their prolonged devotion—
But that through perseverance, they reach a thousand *li*,
And through steadfastness, they build mountains.

To stand by the river and desire fish
Is not as wise as returning to weave nets.
The river’s fish are caught by nets,
And humanity’s Dao is grasped by the heart.

A bow must first be tuned before seeking strength,
A horse must first be guided before seeking excellence,
A person must first be trusted before seeking ability.
To grasp these three principles
Is to discern the essentials of all affairs.

A skilled smith cannot melt wood,
A master craftsman cannot carve ice—
Some things are beyond their capacity.
How then can the virtuous not reflect upon this?

What cannot be shaped cannot become an instrument,
Though the craftsman be skilled, his art finds no use.
What cannot be taught cannot be turned,
Though the sage speak, their intent remains unheeded.

To command people not to cross the river is possible,
But to command the river to have no waves is impossible.
Speak of the river’s waves, and speak of the world’s calamities—
To prevent people from inviting disaster is easy,
But to command the river to have no waves is difficult.
Say not that one is blameless—
The pot will not fall into the well.
*Gu* means guilt.
It speaks not of innocence,
But of the fate one invites.
The pot will not fall into the well—
How then can one avoid consequence?

Those who strike me in my path wish me to yield,
Those who snatch my goods wish me to trade.
Desire stirs within, and its form appears without.
A single chess move does not reveal one’s skill,
A single plucked string does not express one’s sorrow.
A single provocation, though met, does not exhaust justice.
A single string, though drawn, is not yet called mastery.

Now, take a burning ember—
To grasp it risks scorching one’s fingers,
Yet a thousand *dan* of charcoal may be warmed at a distance.
Same *qi*, yet differing accumulation—
There is splendor, and there is decay.
Splendor and decay alternate,
Prosperity and adversity oppose.
Above, there is fine silk,
Below, there must be coarse hemp.
Excessive indulgence cuts deep.
When the sovereign is extravagant, adorning himself in fine silks,
The common folk freeze and starve, lacking sustenance.
How can the ruler not take heed?

Great trees have deep roots,
High mountains have firm foundations.
The sovereign takes the people as his root,
And humility as his foundation.

Laozi said:
*The drum does not store sound, yet it produces sound;
The mirror does not contain form, yet it reveals form.*
The drum does not store sound, the mirror does not contain form—
Yet they produce sound and reveal form.

Metal and stone have sound, yet without striking, they do not ring;
Flutes and pipes have music, yet without blowing, they are silent.
Metal, stone, flutes, and pipes cannot sound of their own accord—
All require striking or blowing to produce sound.
Thus, all beings inherit virtue and power,
Yet without cultivation, they remain incomplete.

Therefore, the sage conceals within,
Does not lead others by example,
Acts only when circumstances demand,
Responds only when things present themselves.
The sage’s words are not spoken lightly,
His actions are not taken in vain.

Heaven’s motion never ceases,
Ending only to begin anew—
Thus it endures.
A wheel turns where it ought,
Thus it reaches distant places.
Heaven’s motion is divine and unfathomable,
Flowing endlessly without measure.
Heaven’s motion never errs,
Thus it knows no failure.

Heaven’s *qi* descends, earth’s *qi* ascends,
Yin and yang intermingle, harmonizing all things.
Heaven’s motion, unerring, the sovereign’s governance, unflawed—
Thus, when Heaven and Earth’s exchange is unobstructed,
All creatures flourish,
Ruler and subject are content,
And all levels of society thrive.

The virtuous thrive in their endeavors,
The petty perish—
This is the Way of Heaven and Earth.
To remove the wicked and employ the worthy
Is to align with Heaven and Earth’s Way.

When Heaven’s *qi* does not descend, earth’s *qi* does not ascend,
Yin and yang do not communicate,
All things do not prosper,
The petty gain influence, the virtuous decline,
The five grains do not grow,
Virtue and power are concealed within.

When Heaven and Earth’s *qi* do not exchange,
Yin and yang’s *qi* does not flow—
It is because the sovereign’s virtue and power are unused,
The deceitful and flatterers prevail,
The petty hold office, the virtuous are exiled,
Causing all things to wither and the five grains to fail.

The Way of Heaven: it gathers the abundant to benefit the scarce,
The Way of Earth: it reduces the high to elevate the low—
This is the Way of Heaven and Earth.

The Way of spirits: the proud and overflowing are humbled,
The arrogant and overflowing meet the humble.
Humanity’s Way: the abundant do not hoard,
The wealthy do not increase their wealth.

The sage’s Way: though lowly, none can surpass him.
He never seeks to be above others,
Thus he is honored by all.

When Heaven’s light shines bright, it illuminates the four quarters,
When the sovereign is enlightened, his ministers are enlightened,
And the realm is at peace.
The realm has four enlightened ones,
And thus it endures.
To enlighten those who enlighten others—
This is to enlighten their transformations.
When the four enlightened ones are complete,
All the people are transformed.

Heaven’s Way is manifest in the *wen*—the sun, moon, and stars.
Earth’s Way is manifest in the *li*—mountains, marshes, rivers, and seas.
One harmonizes them, blending with the undifferentiated *qi*.
Time governs them, responding without disorder,
Giving rise to all things—
This is called the Dao.

It nourishes and sustains all things,
Yet does not rule as their master—
Thus it is called the Dao.

The Great Dao is vast and near,
Not distant from the self.
Cultivate it within oneself,
And its virtue becomes true.
Cultivate it in all things,
And its virtue is unbroken.
To cultivate its truth within is called *zhen*,
To nurture its virtue externally is called *de*.

Heaven covers all things,
Bestowing its virtue and nourishing them,
Giving without taking—
Thus all spirits return to it.
To give without taking is the highest virtue,
Thus it is called *de*.

None is higher than Heaven,
None is lower than the marshes.
Heaven is high, the marshes are low—
The sage follows this model,
Establishing distinctions of honor and humility,
And thus the realm is settled.

The low and the high are arranged in order,
The noble and the base are positioned accordingly.

The Earth bears all things and nurtures them,
Giving and taking in return—
Thus the flesh and bones return to it.
Giving and taking is the lower virtue,
Yet the lower virtue does not lose its virtue—
Thus it is called *virtue*.

Not taking is called the Dao of Heaven:
Heaven generates all things,
Yet only nourishes and sustains them,
Not claiming their substance—
Thus the spirits return to the upper realm.
The one who does not take is the highest virtue,
Thus it is called *virtue*.

The one who takes is called the Dao of the Earth:
Though it completes the forms of all things,
It returns them to their original nature—
Thus the flesh and bones descend to the lower realm,
And this is called *without virtue*.

The Earth receives from Heaven,
Thus it is settled and tranquil;
The Earth is settled and tranquil,
Thus all things take form;
The Earth is vast and thick,
Thus all things gather.
Settled and tranquil, it bears nothing it does not,
Vast and thick, it contains nothing it does not.
The Earth’s power is deep and enduring,
And the waters’ sources converge within it;
The Earth’s Dao is broad and long-lasting,
Thus it can endure and flourish eternally.
The sage follows this model,
And virtue knows no limit in its embrace.

It is said: Heaven and Earth support one another,
To achieve boundless breadth and thickness.
The ruler and minister trust one another,
Thus they can govern in harmony.

When *yin* overcomes *yang*,
All things thrive;
When *yang* overcomes *yin*,
All things stagnate.
When all things thrive, none lacks sustenance;
When all things stagnate, none lacks joy.
When all things are joyful, none remains ungoverned.

When *yin* harms things, *yang* bends itself,
When *yin* advances, *yang* retreats—
Then the petty man gains influence,
And the virtuous withdraw from harm.
The Way is thus clear:
If *yang* is restrained by *yin*,
Then the realm is harmonious and governed;
If the minister overcomes the ruler,
Then the petty man holds power.

When *yang qi* moves, all things relax and find their place—
Thus the sage follows the Dao of *yang*.

To follow things, they will follow in return;
To oppose things, they will oppose in return—
Thus one does not lose the nature and disposition of things.

The *yin* sound is like the *wu* bird.
When the marshes are full, all things flourish in due season;
When the marshes are dry, all things wither.
Thus if the rains do not come,
The land becomes barren and abandoned.
When *yang* ascends and then descends again,
It becomes the master of all things.
It does not overindulge in growth,
Thus it can end and begin anew;
Ending and beginning anew,
Thus it can endure forever.
To endure forever,
Thus it is the mother of all things.

The sage follows the Dao of Heaven,
Acting without effort to endure eternally;
To oppose the nature of things,
Even one in high position cannot hold it.

The *yang qi* must accumulate before it can be applied,
The *yin qi* must gather before it can transform—
None can apply or transform without first accumulating.
Thus the sage is cautious in what he gathers.

Gather *virtue* and blessings follow,
Gather evil and ruin comes.
When *yang* extinguishes *yin*,
All things grow fat;
When *yin* extinguishes *yang*,
All things decay.
Thus, if kings and nobles uphold the Dao of *yang*,
All things thrive;
If they uphold the Dao of *yin*,
The realm perishes.

The *yang* is upright, life-giving—
Thus all things grow fat.
Fatness brings thriving;
The *yin* is perverse, death-dealing—
Thus all things decay.
Decay leads to ruin.

If *yang* does not descend to *yin*,
Then all things cannot form;
If the ruler does not descend to the minister,
Then the virtue of transformation does not flow—
Thus the ruler descends to the minister and becomes wise,
Or does not descend and becomes dull and deaf.

The ruler is not the utmost sage,
Yet cannot descend to the minister;
The minister is not the utmost worthy,
Yet cannot assist the ruler.
Yu Shun bowed to Bo Cheng,
King Wen deferred to Shangfu—
This is called wisdom.

The sun rises from the Earth,
And all things multiply and grow;
Kings and nobles dwell above the people,
To manifest *virtue* and the Way.
The sun sets into the Earth,
And all things rest and recover;
The petty man dwells among the people,
And above them flee in hiding.

It is said:
If *yang* does not descend to *yin*,
Then all things cannot thrive;
If the ruler does not descend to the minister,
Then all things are concealed.

When thunder moves, all things awaken,
When dew moistens, all things are refreshed—
The great man’s actions are like this.

The movements of *yin* and *yang* have constant rhythms,
Yet the great man’s actions do not exhaust things.
When the great man is at his peak,
It is like spring’s thunder.
When he issues his commands,
It is like the gentle wind.
Both are harmonious and follow the Way,
Thus they do not exhaust things.

Thunder stirs the Earth,
And all things relax;
Wind sways the trees,
And grasses and woods flourish.
The great man abandons evil and pursues goodness,
And the people do not stray far—
Thus the people have paths of departure and return.
The more they depart, the more they regret;
The less they return, the more they are at ease.

Moreover, when the great man has goodness,
The people flock to him.
Like the Great King’s departure from Bi,
How distant was it?

Fire moves only with fuel,
The great man’s words must have truth.
With truth and sincerity,
Where can he not succeed?
Fire spreads as fuel is passed on;
Words take effect as truth is upheld.
Thus, when the great man speaks,
His actions follow without delay,
And his truth is like the four seasons.

The Yellow River is deep,
Its banks lie against the mountains;
The hills and mounds are high,
Their depths sink into the abyss.
When *yang qi* is strong, it transforms into *yin*;
When *yin qi* is strong, it transforms into *yang*—
Thus desire cannot be fully satisfied,
And joy cannot be pushed to its extreme.
The Dao of Heaven is sublime and elevated,
Yet only moderates desire to maintain harmony,
To follow Heaven’s principles,
And not let things reach their limits.

Anger without harsh words,
Rage without changing countenance—
This is called *calculating* (obtaining) virtue.
Though anger and rage remain,
Yet harsh words and perverse expressions are not uttered.
If they do not manifest externally,
Then virtue is obtained within—
This is called *calculating* virtue through the Way.

The *yang* spreads harmoniously throughout the realm,
The *yin* sinks and drowns the realm in chaos.
To lean toward *yang* is to align with loyal and virtuous,
Thus harmony prevails.
To lean toward *yin* is to align with flatterers and deceivers,
Thus chaos descends.

Laozi said:
Accumulating thinness forms thickness,
Accumulating lowliness forms height.
The noble man strives daily to achieve brilliance,
The petty man strives daily to reach disgrace.
The noble man diligently cultivates himself to follow the Dao,
And his radiance increases daily.
The petty man rides on the threshold to indulge his desires,
And ultimately meets ruin and shame.

Though these changes may not be seen,
Yet to see goodness as if it were not attainable,
And to regard past evil as if it were not ominous—
If one turns toward goodness,
Even past mistakes bring no blame;
If one does not turn toward goodness,
Even loyalty cannot avert coming misfortune.
Thus blaming others is not as grave as blaming oneself,
And striving to win others is not as effective as striving within oneself.

Sound is self-summoned,
Kindred spirits seek one another,
Reputation is self-bestowed,
And people are self-appointed—
None of these are beyond oneself.

With a sharp blade to pierce, with an edge to strike—
What cause for blame against others?

Thus the noble man guards against the subtle.
To guard the subtle means words need not be grand.
If one turns toward goodness,
Then virtue comes not from others—
Strive within oneself.

If one does not turn toward goodness,
Then calamity returns to oneself—
What cause for blame against others?
To do evil is like wielding a blade to cut oneself,
Or piling fire upon fire to douse it—
Who then would censure you?

All things embrace yin while cradling yang,
Their clashing qi harmonized.
This harmony dwells at the center—
Thus grains bear fruit in their husks,
Grasses bear fruit in their pods,
Eggs and wombs gestate within the center,
And those without eggs or wombs
Take time to manifest.
Though forms and kinds differ,
In their generation,
All arise from central harmony to form their essence,
And thus require time to complete.

Yet what they become through transformation
Is what must unfold in due course.

When the earth is level, water does not flow;
When light and heavy are balanced, the scale does not tilt.
The earth level, and water has no rushing force;
The scale balanced, and things have no weighty tilt.

The generation and transformation of things
Come from response—
Not without cause.
All things in their birth
Have their own triggers—
Not in vain.

Laozi said:
When mountains reach their height,
Then clouds and rain arise there.
When waters reach their depth,
Then dragons and serpents take form.
When the noble man fulfills the Dao,
Then virtue and blessings flow from him.

Those who harbor hidden virtue
Shall receive manifest reward,
Those who act in secret
Shall gain renowned name.
The mountains’ spirits, when most potent,
Descend as clouds and rain.
The Dao’s heights, when most sublime,
Bestow virtue and blessings.

Never does reward come before the deed.
He who plants millet does not reap barley,
He who sows resentment gains no gratitude.
Plant millet and reap barley—
Return resentment for virtue.

*Volume Seven of the Treatise on the Mysterious and True*
*Commentary by Mò Xīzǐ*

The subtle luminosity—
Dao encompasses what lies beyond form, hence *subtle*;
virtue conceals itself within the unseen, hence *luminous*.

Thus, without subtlety, one cannot fathom its origin;
without luminosity, one cannot grasp its essence.
The meaning of *subtle luminosity* lies in its embodiment and function.

Laozi says:
*The Dao may be weak or strong,
soft or hard,
yin or yang,
obscure or luminous,
enveloping heaven and earth,
responding without fixed form.*
This aligns with the intent of *"The Origin of the Dao."*

Shallow knowledge knows not the depths,
outer knowledge knows not the inner,
coarse knowledge knows not the refined,
known knowledge is but unknown,
unknown knowledge is true knowing—
who then knows knowing as unknown,
unknown as knowing?

The Dao cannot be heard—heard, it is not;
the Dao cannot be seen—seen, it is not;
the Dao cannot be spoken—spoken, it is not.
Who then knows the formless form?

Thus, all under heaven know goodness as goodness—
and so it ceases to be good.
The wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise.

The Dao transcends form and sound—
how then can hearing and seeing discern it?
Virtue requires no adornment—
how can good and evil define it?
Thus, the wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise—
this is the utmost truth.

**Wénzǐ asked:** Can one speak in subtlety?
**Laozi replied:** Why not?
Do you mean *speaking of knowing*?
He who speaks of knowing does not speak through words.
*Subtle speech* is speech of the utmost refinement.
Only when one forgets the words can one truly speak.

Chasing fish, one’s hands grow wet;
hunting beasts, one’s feet grow swift—
not for joy’s sake.
Thus, the utmost speech transcends speech,
the utmost action transcends action.
The shallow-minded contend over trifles.

Speech has its root; affairs have their master.
To act without knowing is why one is not known.

The Dao is the nameless mystery;
speech is the root of ultimate truth.
Those who grasp the mystery speak not;
those who clarify the root contend not.
Thus, speech reaches its peak in silence,
action in inaction—
and knowing knows itself.
Who then departs from my knowing?

**Wénzǐ asked:** Does governing a state also have its method?
**Laozi replied:** Observe the wagon-driver:
He calls forward *"Yā!"* and *"Xī!"*—
the fire must be stoked.
The rear echoes in response—
this is the driver’s song to spur the horses.
Though the music of Zhèng, Wèi, Hú, or Chǔ
cannot match its purpose.

Governing a state relies on ritual propriety,
not on eloquence.
The more laws proliferate, the more thieves arise.
What is used must suit its purpose;
each must meet its necessity—
like the wagon-driver’s song,
yet not performed with the music of *Xiánqí*.

Governing a state and nourishing the people
prioritizes simplicity—
why adorn with ornate colors?

Laozi says:
*The Dao has no fixed form yet can be the standard;
like mountains and forests yielding timber,
but timber does not equal mountains and forests,
mountains and forests do not equal clouds and rain,
clouds and rain do not equal yin and yang,
yin and yang do not equal harmony,
harmony does not equal the Dao.*
The Dao is the form without form,
the image without substance—
its intent cannot be exhausted.
Yet between heaven and earth,
it can be shaped and transformed without end.

The great Dao has no fixed origin;
just as timber arises from mountains and forests,
though mountains and forests are not timber.
From clouds and rain onward,
what is spoken falls short of the Dao—
for it lacks form and image,
yet embraces all things,
encompassing all directions.
Only those who embody the Dao know its boundless transformation.

Laozi says:
*The sage establishes teachings and governs,
ever mindful of beginning and end,
observing the creation of virtue.*
*Creation of virtue* means establishing laws.
Thus, when the people know writing, virtue declines;
when they know calculations, benevolence declines;
when they know contracts, trust declines;
when they know machinery, substance declines.
These four arise only when the Dao is lost.
As times change, laws must adapt—
the stricter the laws, the more they are transgressed.
Thus, as trust declines and machinery is devised,
governance and teaching flourish—
yet deceit and corruption worsen.

The *sè* does not sound, yet its twenty-five strings each respond in harmony;
the axle does not turn itself, yet its thirty spokes each contribute their strength.
Strings must differ in tension to compose melody;
wheels must vary in labor to travel far.
What appears to make sound is silent;
what appears to turn is still.
The *sè* has no sound—sound lies in the strings.
The axle does not turn—turning lies in the wheels.
Thus, silence yields sound, stillness yields motion—
silence’s sound completes the melody,
stillness’s turning achieves distance.

Superior and inferior follow different paths—
ease in governance leads to disorder.
High position with great virtue follows;
great affairs with petty virtue bring ruin.
A cap cannot be trodden upon the feet;
a subject cannot be honored above the sovereign.
When superior and inferior are disordered—
ruin is imminent.

Minor virtue harms righteousness,
minor goodness harms the Dao,
minor eloquence harms governance,
harshness injures virtue.
Clinging to petty kindness obscures the great Dao;
indulging petty anger harms supreme virtue.

The greatest rectitude is unassailable,
thus the people are easily guided.
The utmost governance is effortless,
thus the lower ranks do not rebel.
The utmost loyalty returns to simplicity,
thus the people harbor no deceit.
When the superior is balanced and just,
the lower ranks harbor no deceit.
When the superior is pure and unadorned,
the lower ranks harbor no craftiness.

Laozi says:
*If laws of mutual guarantee are established,
the people will resent them;
if decrees reducing rank proliferate,
meritorious ministers will rebel.*
Litigation spreads—
the innocent bear the blame.
Ranks are diminished in silence—
the meritorious harbor resentment.

The sagacious discern only the traces of legal documents yet fail to grasp the

The Sage dwells in seclusion to avoid calamity, remains silent and still to await the proper moment;
The petty man knows not the gates of fortune and misfortune—he acts and falls into punishment. Though he makes every effort to prepare, it is insufficient to preserve his body.

Thus, the superior man first avoids calamity and then pursues advantage, first shuns disgrace and only then seeks fame.
Therefore, the Sage always attends to what lies beyond the formless, yet does not dwell on what is already manifest within—thus, calamity has no means to arrive, and praise cannot soil him.

When one is ensnared by gain and harm, it arises from love and hatred.
If love and hatred do not arise, where do slander and praise come from?

The noble man sees what is yet unformed and finds it easy to govern; the petty man, though he makes every effort to prepare, ultimately meets disaster.
To rescue what is already formed—once it is complete, escape is difficult.

Laozi said: The Way of the common man—his heart should be small, his aspirations great, his wisdom encompassing, his conduct upright, his abilities manifold, his undertakings few.
By "heart small," it means to anticipate misfortune before it arises, to guard against disaster with utmost caution, and to dare not indulge his desires.
By "aspirations great," it means to embrace all under heaven, to unify disparate customs, to gather all judgments and make them converge at the center.
By "wisdom encompassing," it means to have no beginning or end, to flow in all directions, to be deep and inexhaustible like a fountain.
By "conduct upright," it means to stand firm and unyielding, to remain pure and unstained, to hold fast to principles in adversity and not to boast in prosperity.
By "abilities manifold," it means to possess both literary and martial virtues, to act and rest in accordance with propriety, to wield and discard things with fitting measure.
By "undertakings few," it means to grasp the essential and govern the multitude, to hold fast to simplicity and manage the vast, to remain still and thus control the restless.

Thus, the one whose heart is small is restrained by the subtle;
The one whose aspirations are great embraces all within his bosom;
The one whose wisdom is encompassing knows all without effort;
The one whose conduct is upright has nothing he will not do;
The one whose abilities are manifold governs all without fail;
The one whose undertakings are few holds fast to what is essential.

These six virtues—none but the most exalted Sage or High True One can fully embody them.

Thus, when the Sage encounters goodness, he does not deem it too small to act upon, nor does he overlook even the slightest fault without correction. His actions require no shamans or sorcerers, yet ghosts and spirits dare not act before him—this is the height of nobility.
Yet he remains ever vigilant, cautious each day, and thus achieves unity through non-action.
Externally, he does not fail the world; internally, he feels no shame.
Why invoke shamans? Why fear ghosts and spirits?
By maintaining constant reverence, one may preserve his end.

The wisdom of the foolish is already meager, yet their actions are many—thus, they are bound to fail.
Therefore, governing through proper instruction and teaching is easy and certain to succeed;
Governing through perverse teaching is difficult and certain to fail.
To abandon what is easy and certain to succeed, and instead engage in what is difficult and certain to fail—this is the folly of the confused.
Without measuring gain and loss, one sits and invites ruin.
When undertakings are complex and difficult, though labored, they will fail.
When things are simple and easy to follow, they will succeed—yet to not act upon them is the height of folly.

Laozi said: The rise of fortune is gradual and unbroken, while the birth of calamity is sudden and chaotic. The patterns of fortune and misfortune are subtle and unseen.
The Sage perceives their beginning and end—thus, they cannot be ignored.
Fortune is as light as a feather, yet only the Sage discerns it;
Calamity is as vast as Tai Mountain, yet the foolish see it not.

The enlightened ruler’s rewards and punishments are not for himself, but for the state.
What benefits himself but serves no function for the state—he does not bestow reward upon it;
What harms himself but aids the state—he does not inflict punishment upon it.
The enlightened ruler’s rewards and punishments are based on impartial justice.
What benefits the state and aids the people—he implements it;
What profits himself but harms the people—he halts it.

Thus, to uphold propriety in accordance with what is fitting is called a noble man;
To abandon propriety’s fitting measure is called a petty man.
Are noble and petty men fixed in their nature?
When actions and conduct align with what is fitting, he is a noble man;
When actions and conduct defy what is fitting, he is a petty man.

The highest wisdom is obtained without effort—this is the esoteric understanding of the superior man.
The next level is to labor without exhaustion—the diligent common man, striving without weariness.
The lowest is to labor while sick—
The inferior man’s heart is sluggish and confused, his spirit dull and muddled, thus his labor is excessive and his illness worsens.

The ancients savored the Dao without clinging to it;
The people of today abandon the Dao and yet boast of themselves.
Not to cling is not to dwell.
To savor the Way is to savor.
The ancients savored the Way without dwelling, while today’s people have no Way yet praise themselves.

Zhou’s ruler made ivory chopsticks—
Chopsticks crafted from elephant tusk—
And Ji Zi sighed, lamenting their extravagant splendor.
Lu buried their dead with wooden effigies—
Effigies, carved wooden figures resembling humans, used as ritual vessels—
And Confucius sighed, mourning their violation of propriety.

See where it begins, and you will know where it ends.

The petty man sees ivory chopsticks—
chopsticks crafted from elephant tusk—
and wooden effigies—
carved wooden figures resembling humans, used as ritual vessels—
and assumes that their life is one of honor and their death one of grandeur.

The gentleman examines them and knows that their Dao is in decline, their fortune lost.

Laozi said: *"Ren* is what men admire, *yi* is what men hold in high regard.
To be admired by men and held in high regard by men—
yet sometimes one’s own death and one’s country’s ruin—
is because one did not conform to the times.

Thus, he who knows *ren* and *yi* yet does not know the world’s power—
is not versed in the Dao.

To vainly extol the virtues of *ren* and *yi*—
yet fail to recognize the shifts of opportunity and strategy—
is of no use in averting defeat and ruin.
How can such a one be called a man of comprehensive understanding?

The Five Emperors valued *de* and ruled without action;
The Three Kings employed *yi* and punished the violent to pacify the people.

The Five Hegemons relied on strength—
strength in terms of martial and intellectual prowess.

Now, if one applies the methods of the Five Emperors and Three Kings to the age of the Five Hegemons,
it is not their proper Dao.

Thus, what is good or bad is the same,
yet praise or blame lies in convention;
what is proper or improper is equal,
yet conformity or rebellion depends on the times.

Speaking of times being different and governance varying,
to practice the Dao of the most ancient era in the age of the Five Hegemons
is like gluing a column to a tuning peg—
a fixed and unyielding approach—
or quenching thirst with poison.
Indeed, it is difficult.

He who knows the Heaven’s workings and understands human affairs
can thereby govern the world and traverse the Dao.

To govern is to maintain the norm.

He who knows Heaven yet does not know man
will fail to engage with the world’s conventions;
he who knows man yet does not know Heaven
will fail to wander in the Dao.

Knowing Heaven and knowing man,
knowing convention and knowing the times—
one can govern the world and wander in the Dao.

To align one’s resolve with true nature and suit one’s emotions,
if one insists rigidly, one becomes a thief to the Dao—
using one’s body to serve external things.
If one succumbs to external things, one exhausts one’s vital *qi*—
like ice and fire clashing,
or the extremes of *yin* and *yang* disrupting balance.

The man who attains the Dao,
though outwardly transformed, inwardly remains unaltered.
Outward transformation is to know man;
inward constancy is to preserve one’s self.
Thus, within he holds firm to his principles,
while without he bends and adapts,
moves with the world without falling into harm—
the precious quality of the Dao lies in its *long* variation.

The man who attains the Dao,
when he acts, does so in harmony with Heaven;
when he is still, he rests upon Earth.
His actions and stillness are lost without timing,
yet his withdrawal and engagement lie within himself—
thus, convention cannot harm him,
and the world cannot constrain him.

Hence, Master Kong saw the Old Sage—
Laozi—
as though he were a *long*.
Variation without fixed form.

To uphold a single principle and follow one course of action,
even if it leads to fulfillment,
it is still inflexible—
clinging to petty preferences while obstructing the great Dao.

If one is stuck in one way,
how can one speak of the great Dao?

The Dao is serene and tranquil, void and formless—
it does not act upon things,
nor does it act upon itself.
Between things and self, distinction is naturally erased.

The serene and tranquil state of the Dao
is effortless yet profound.

Thus, to undertake actions while conforming to the Dao—
is not the Dao’s own doing,
but the Dao’s application.

The Dao is inherently without action,
yet now it is said to conform to the Dao—
this is indeed action.
Action brings about strife,
and strife spawns calamity.

Since the Dao has no fixed appearance
and actions have no fixed conformity,
to insist upon them is to rebel against them—
then disputes arise in confusion,
and misfortune is the result.
Hence, it is said that this is not the Dao’s own doing.

*Shi* is to set forth—
to establish norms and rituals as the Dao’s outward expressions,
not its true essence.
They cannot be rigidly adhered to.

To adhere is to lose its meaning;
to act upon it is to fail in its purpose.

The principle can be made clear.

The heavens and earth enfold and bear all things,
the sun and moon illuminate them,
the yin and yang nurture them,
the rain and dew nourish them,
and virtue and the Dao uphold them—
all share in the same harmony.

Thus, those who bear the great round
and tread the great square
are said to wear the heavens and walk upon the earth.
Those who gaze upon the utmost purity
see the great brightness—
to behold the sun and moon.
Those who establish the utmost peace
dwell in the great hall—
to be within the cosmos.

Those who wander in the boundless dark
shine with the sun and moon,
giving life to form from formlessness—
thus, the true person entrusts themselves to the spirit platform
and returns to the origin of things,
reverting to the unborn.

To gaze into the boundless dark,
to listen to the soundless—
within the boundless dark, there is alone clarity,
within the stillness, there is alone illumination.

The true person, dwelling between heaven and earth,
witnessing the light of sun and moon,
wandering in the utmost peace—
where could they go without finding ease?
Residing in the great hall,
they are contained within no boundless dark,
discerning the soundless,
while all sounds respond within the stillness,
illuminating the formless,
while all forms appear—
thus, they preserve with heaven and earth,
shine with the sun and moon,
entrust themselves to the spirit platform,
and contain the utmost essence.
They are the true person.

Their use is in non-use,
and only when not using can they truly use.
Their knowing is in non-knowing,
and only when not knowing can they truly know.

「Before, this was explained.

The **Dao/Way** is what gives rise to all things,
**Virtue/Power** is what sustains life,
**Ren** is the proof of accumulated benevolence,
**Yi** is what aligns with the heart yet harmonizes with the masses, fittingly so.

These four—used to govern the world and cultivate oneself—must not be abandoned.

When the **Dao/Way** is lost, **Virtue/Power** flourishes;
when **Virtue/Power** declines, **Ren** and **Yi** arise.
Thus, in the upper age, the **Dao/Way** prevails yet **Virtue/Power** is not yet established,
in the middle age, **Virtue/Power** is upheld yet **Ren** and **Yi** are not cherished,
in the lower age, **Ren** and **Yi** are clung to, fearing their loss—
so the **Junzi** (noble person) cannot live without **Yi**, and losing **Yi** means losing what sustains their life;
the **xiaoren** (petty person) cannot survive without profit, and losing profit means losing what sustains their existence.
Thus, the **Junzi** fears losing **Yi** as misfortune,
while the **xiaoren** seeks profit as fortune.
Observing their fears, the paths to calamity and blessing diverge.

When the **Dao/Way** is abandoned, **Virtue/Power** perishes;
when **Ren** is severed, **Yi** grows thin.
The **Junzi** without **Yi** cannot preserve their **Dao/Way**,
the **xiaoren** without profit cannot sustain their life.
The **Junzi** fears losing **Yi** as misfortune,
while the **xiaoren** pursues profit as fortune.

Laozi says:
*"If one seeks profit in affairs,
it only brings harm;
if one seeks harm in affairs,
it only brings profit."*

To feed the **hot** (excessive heat) when one suffers from **dampness** (湿),
to drink the **cold** (excessive cold) when one is parched—
this is how the common folk nourish their ailments,
yet the skilled physician knows it as the cause of disease.
Delight in the eyes, delight in the heart—
the advantage of the foolish,
the avoidance of those with the **Dao/Way**.

The **sage** (圣人) first meets and then aligns,
the common folk first align and then meet—
thus, the gates of misfortune and fortune,
the inversion of harm and profit,
must be carefully observed.

To quench thirst with water—
the skilled physician sees it as misfortune;
to take wealth from unjust means—
the **Junzi** sees it as harm.

To first oppose and then align—
the folly of the foolish;
to first align and then oppose—
the abhorrence of the sage.

For harm and profit are contrary,
misfortune and fortune are interdependent—
they must be carefully observed.

Laozi says:
*"One with merit who abandons **Ren** and **Yi** will be met with suspicion,
one with guilt who possesses **Ren** and **Yi** will be met with trust."*

Thus, **Ren** and **Yi** are the natural order of affairs,
the most honored rank in the world.
Though one’s achievements and name may already be established,
**Ren** and **Yi** must not be abandoned—
to abandon them invites guilt,
to uphold them secures honor.
Though one’s schemes may succeed,
they should consider releasing their ambitions to preserve **Yi**—
if a state exists yet its affairs abandon **Yi**,
its merit will not be fulfilled.
Though one’s plans may not align with strategy,
if they benefit the state,
and if one’s heart is devoted to the ruler,
harmonizing with **Ren** and **Yi**,
then their life will be preserved.
Hence it is said:
*"A hundred words, a hundred schemes,
though often misplaced,
are not as good as abandoning them
and carefully upholding **Ren** and **Yi**."*

As a subject of the ruler,
if one schemes to resolve difficulties,
arrogantly honors oneself,
yet their merit does not succeed—
it is because they abandoned **Ren** and **Yi**.
Some may have wise counsel,
yet it is not used;
some may have extraordinary schemes,
yet they fail to be implemented;
some may serve the ruler with all their might,
though not noticed,
yet they preserve **Ren** and **Yi**,
never daring to forget them for a moment,
and thus their life remains unharmed.

Laozi says:
*"Teaching originates from the **Junzi**,
while the **xiaoren** benefit from its influence;
profit originates from the **xiaoren**,
while the **Junzi** enjoy its merit.
If the **Junzi** and **xiaoren** each find their proper place,
then governance is effortless,
the **Dao/Way** is fulfilled.
**Virtue/Power’s** influence reaches below,
wealth and profit are offered above—
then there is no need for officials,
yet all things are governed;
no need for commands,
yet all things proceed in order.
Each finds their proper place—
this is the fulfillment of the **Dao/Way**.*

**Virtue/Power** (德) as the root, **subordinates** (臣) as the branches—
if the root is not strong yet the branches flourish,
such a thing has never existed.

The **sage’s** governance is clear in their **four eyes** (四目),
perceptive in their **four ears** (四聪),
rejecting deceit and evil,
trusting the virtuous and capable—
then the ruler may sit back with hands folded,
doing nothing yet all is transformed,
and the subjects may give their utmost effort,
fulfilling their duties without strife.
How could there be logic in contention?
Thus, the root grows ever stronger,
the branches flourish abundantly.

Laozi says:
*"A benevolent father’s love for his child
is not for seeking repayment—
if it were, it could not be sincere.
A sagely ruler’s care for the people
is not for personal use—
by nature, it cannot be otherwise.
Yet if one relies on their strength,
depends on their merits,
and must exhaust them for gain,
then benevolence is not extended.
The father’s love for his child,
the ruler’s care for his people—
why seek repayment?
This is the natural division,
the **Dao/Way** of heaven.
Some rulers and fathers,
relying on their strength,
arrogant toward their subjects and children—
their benevolence is not extended.
Thus, to use what the common folk love,
one gains the common folk’s strength;
to raise what the common folk delight in,
one gains the common folk’s hearts.
Hence, by observing their beginning,
one knows their end.
To love all under heaven,
though the world be vast,
it is as one family—
not to love all under heaven,
though the individual be humble,
they are like a lone gate in a million fields.
By this, the end and beginning may be known,
life and death may be discerned.*

Laozi says:
*"People rely on **Yi** for love,
cliques rely on **group strength** (群强) for power—
thus, the broader the application of **Yi**,
the farther the influence of **wei** (威/authority) extends;
the thinner the application of **Yi**,
the smaller the reach of **wu** (武/force) becomes.
This means:
**Virtue/Power’s** influence is impartial,
those who attach to it are many;
to abandon **Yi** and use **force**,
those who remain are few."*

Laozi says:
*"To take by unjust means yet not distribute—
disaster will come to their own person,
they cannot benefit others,
nor can they benefit themselves—
this is truly foolish,
no different from the owl’s love for its young.
To take unjustly and hoard without dispersing—
this is called **self-destructive nourishment** (养自喷),
**self-inflicted calamity** (育枭自祸).
Hence, to hold and let it overflow—
it is better to let it be;
to grasp and make it sharp—
it cannot be long preserved.

*(#5: "热" and "寒" retain their TCM meanings—excessive heat and cold respectively.
"盈" retains its original meaning of "overflowing" or "excessive" in the context of hoarding.)*

The gates may be firmly barred and the granaries filled,
yet they will ultimately become the resources of great thieves—
how can such wealth endure?

Within **virtue/power** lies the **Way/Dao**, and within the **Way/Dao** lies **virtue/power**—
its transformations are boundless.

Those who embody the **Way/Dao** must possess **virtue/power**,
and those who possess **virtue/power** must embody the **Way/Dao**.
When **virtue/power** and the **Way/Dao** are fully realized,
they align with the boundless transformations of nature.

Within the bright (yang) lies the dark (yin),
and within the dark (yin) lies the bright (yang)—
all things are thus,
inexhaustible in their manifestations.

When fortune arrives, auspicious signs appear;
when calamity strikes, ominous signs precede it.
To see auspicious signs yet fail to act virtuously—
fortune will not come.
To see ominous signs yet act virtuously—
calamity will not strike.

Benefit and harm share the same threshold,
misfortune and fortune dwell as neighbors—
none but the sage can distinguish them.

Thus it is said:
*"Misfortune is fortune’s shadow,
fortune is misfortune’s hidden seed—
who can fathom their limits?"*

Within the bright (yang) lies the dark (yin),
and within the dark (yin) lies the bright (yang)—
speaking of fortune concealed in misfortune,
and misfortune lurking in fortune.

To see fortune and deem it auspicious—
one knows fortune is the beginning of misfortune;
to see misfortune and hastily act virtuously—
one knows misfortune is the precursor to fortune.

The coming of misfortune and fortune
is like intertwined strands—
none but the sage can discern their limits.

When a person’s illness approaches,
they first crave the taste of fish and meat;
when a nation is on the verge of ruin,
it first rejects the words of loyal ministers.

The sick delight in flavors,
revel in delicacies—
a sure sign of impending death.
A disordered state despises loyal counsel,
trusts flatterers—
a clear omen of impending collapse.

Thus, when death is near,
even the finest physician cannot save.
When a nation teeters on ruin,
even the most loyal counsel cannot preserve it.

Only the finest physicians and loyal ministers
can recognize the inevitable—
that which cannot be saved should not be treated,
that which can be salvaged must be acted upon.

Cultivate oneself first,
then one may govern the people.
Manage the household with order,
then one may lead the officials.

Thus it is said:
*"Cultivate oneself, and **virtue/power** becomes genuine;
cultivate the family, and **virtue/power** overflows;
cultivate the nation, and **virtue/power** flourishes.*
To observe others through oneself,
to govern family and state—
the essence lies in perfecting **virtue/power**,
the key in preserving its integrity.

The people’s livelihood depends on clothing and food.
If these are adequately provided, there is merit;
if neglected, there is none.
When merit is absent, **virtue/power** does not endure.

Clothing and food are the lifeblood of the common folk,
and the common folk are the foundation of ruler and subject.
When clothing and food are secured for the people,
the ruler and officials flourish in the state.

Thus, if policies fail despite proper timing,
do not alter the laws;
if governance fails despite proper timing,
do not change the principles.
When the time returns, this is called the **Way/Dao**’s rhythm.

There are rises and falls in the times,
cycles of prosperity and decline.
One cannot use the excessive governance of past eras
as the essential principles for today—
saying laws must not be abolished,
principles must not be altered.
To understand this is to grasp the **Way/Dao**’s framework.

The sage-king enriches his people—
this is to strengthen the roots.
The hegemon enriches his lands—
this is to seek expansion.
A failing state enriches its officials—
heavy taxation brings only ruin.
If governance seems insufficient in order,
it will also be insufficient in chaos—
this is the subtle beginning of disorder.

A doomed state empties its granaries.
Unchecked expenditures drain the stores daily,
the ruler grows impoverished, the people exhausted—
what more awaits but collapse?

Thus it is said:
*"When the ruler does nothing, the people prosper;
when the ruler acts minimally, the people transform naturally.
Let them dwell in contentment,
let them take joy in their work.*

To raise an army of ten thousand costs a thousand gold daily—
after the campaign, famine will follow.
Thus war is an inauspicious instrument,
not the treasure of the virtuous.

When arms are raised, famine follows;
when expenditures are vast, the people grow weary of service.
Thus it is known that weapons are not the sage’s treasure.

To reconcile great grudges leaves lingering resentment—
how can this be called virtuous?
To reconcile resentment is to say the ruler is unclear.
To demote meritorious ministers,
to strip territorial lords of their lands—
to act on a moment’s anger,
only to sow future calamity.
When the ruler rages above,
when ministers grow insolent below—
how can this be called virtuous, yet accumulate resentment?

In ancient times, those close were not swayed by words,
those distant were not commanded by speech—
nearby subjects were pleased,
distant subjects came willingly.
To please the near and attract the far#6—
this depends on **virtue/power**, not words.

To share desires with the people brings harmony,
to share safeguards with the people brings stability,
to share concerns with the people brings wisdom,
to harness the people’s strength brings wealth,
to earn the people’s praise brings prestige.

Actions invite bandits,
words invite calamity.
Do not speak before others,
for by the time you act, they have already spoken.
Whispered words, once spoken, spread far—
this is called *transmission*.
To speak before others is to have it reach their ears first.
Rumors travel a thousand *li*.

Words are calamity,
the tongue is a trigger—
once spoken inappropriately, not even four horses can chase them back.
Bandits act from desire,
calamity arises from words.

Yet words, once spoken, run without feet,
fly without wings.
A single blemish on a white jade—
what four horses could chase it away?
This is the swiftness of spoken calamity.

The Yellow Court Master once said:
The heavens have five directions—
the four cardinals and the center.
The earth has five phases—
metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.
Sounds have five tones—
*gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*.
Flavors have five tastes—
sweet, bitter, spicy, sour, and salty.
Colors have five hues—
blue, yellow, red, white, and black.
Humans have five ranks—
the five constants.

Thus between heaven and earth there are twenty-five kinds of people.
Twenty-five grades of human worth,
each with distinct classifications.

The highest five are:
the **Divine Person** (神人), the **True Person** (真人), the **Dao Person** (道人), the **Perfect Person** (至人), and the **Sage** (圣人).
To transform without measure is divine,
to be pure and unadulterated is true,
to traverse without obstruction is the **Dao**,
to penetrate profound mysteries is perfect,
to comprehend all things is sage.

The next five are:
the **Virtuous Person** (德人), the **Exemplary Person** (贤人), the **Wise Person** (智人), the **Kind Person** (善人), and the **Persuasive Person** (辩人).
To nurture inwardly is virtue,
to be benevolent and loving is exemplary,
to be enlightened and merciful is wisdom,
to be gentle and harmonious is kindness,
to possess discernment is persuasive.

The middle five are:
the **Public Person** (公人), the **Loyal Person** (忠人), the **Trustworthy Person** (信人), the **Righteous Person** (义人), and the **Proprietous Person** (礼人).
To be without self-interest is public,
to serve one’s lord with devotion is loyalty,
to never deceive is trustworthiness,
to act in accordance with propriety is righteousness,
to be respectful and yielding is propriety.

The next five are:
the **Scholar** (士人), the **Artisan** (工人), the **Forester** (虞人), the **Farmer** (农人), and the **Merchant** (商人).
To serve superiors is the scholar,
to craft tools is the artisan,
to oversee mountains and marshes is the forester,
to cultivate fields is the farmer,
to facilitate trade is the merchant.

The lowest five are:
the **Common Folk** (众人), the **Servant** (奴人), the **Foolish Person** (愚人), the **Brute** (肉人), and the **Petty Person** (小人).
The multitude are the common folk,
those bound to labor are servants,
those dull and tasteless are foolish,
those lacking wisdom are brutes,
those lacking discernment are petty.

The highest five and the lowest five—
as distant as humans are from cattle and horses.
To speak of the wise and foolish is to mark vast disparity,
as vast as the gulf between heaven and earth.

The **Sage** moves through the world:
with eyes to see, ears to hear, a mouth to speak, and feet to walk.
A Sage in the world is still entangled by the six passions,
yet still relies on borrowed forms.

The **True Person** transcends:
seeing without eyes, hearing without ears,
moving without obstruction, speaking without words.
A Sage beyond the world—
the heart already emptied, all traces erased.

Thus, though the Sage stirs the world,
the True Person never surpasses them;
though the Virtuous Person adorns the age,
the Sage never deigns to observe them.

To govern the world and preserve the True—
each fulfills their proper measure.
Thus, the sage-king **Tang** and **Yao** aligned their virtue with heaven,
while **Zhong Wu** stood tall to rectify the age.

The **Dao** is without before or after,
without left or right.
All things merge in the Mysterious Oneness—
neither this nor that.

To welcome it, there is no before;
to follow it, there is no after.
Who can grasp its left?
Who knows its right?
Erased in the Mysterious Oneness,
yet named **Dao** by force.

*End of Volume Seven of the **True Classic of the Mysterious Oneness***
*Volume Eight of the **True Classic of the Mysterious Oneness**, with annotations by **Mo Xi Zi**.*

The **Dao** is naturally so—
this is its supreme designation.
Unknown yet so, neither is it not so.
All things are thus;
they cannot but be so.
Yet naturally so,
not by any doing or dependence#1,
hence it is called *natural*.

The *Laozi* says:
*"The clear and empty—this is heaven’s luminosity,
the non-doing—this is governance’s constant."*

Within the void, there is spirit;
within darkness, there is light.
Who can perceive it?
It aligns with the **Dao**—
non-doing governs itself,
and all things are thereby perfected.

Abandon favor and wisdom,
set aside sagehood and intelligence,
reject the virtuous and the capable,
abolish ritual and propriety,
extinguish customs and precepts,
discard flattery and sophistry,
prohibit deceit and falsehood—
then the virtuous and the base alike return to the **Dao**.
Remove these seven things,
and the wise have nothing to exalt,
the foolish nothing to regret—
all merge into the Great **Dao**,
restoring naturalness.

Stillness brings unity,
emptiness brings harmony.
Supreme virtue is non-doing—
all things find their place within it.
The **Dao** of emptiness and stillness
endures as heaven and earth endure,
its subtlety pervades all things,
yet it does not dominate.

When the heart is empty,
it is open to all.
When virtue is full,
it contains all.
Thus it moves with divine efficacy yet has no master,
circulates endlessly without weariness.

The twelve months revolve,
beginning anew—
the eternal turning of the twelve-month wheel.
End and beginning—
this is the **Dao** of heaven.

Metal, wood, water, fire, earth:
their forces may clash,
yet their **Dao** depends on one another.
The Five Phases propel each other—
one ascends, one declines.
Cold and heat alternate,
advancing and retreating in their time.
Life and death follow the **Dao**,
never straying from their due.

Thus extreme cold harms things—
yet without cold, it would be impossible;
extreme heat harms things—
yet without heat, it would be impossible.
Thus both what is possible and what is not
are possible.
Hence the Great **Dao** knows no impossibility—
what is fitting is fitting;
see what is fitting and act,
see what is not and cease.
Possible and impossible
are like left and right,
like exterior and interior.

Cold and heat succeed each other—
this is the **Dao** of heaven and earth.
Rites and punishments are the Sage’s laws.
Yet though cold and heat may be harsh,
they cannot be absent.
When timing is right, what harm is there?
Though punishments may be severe,
they cannot be abolished.
What is right is not harmful.
See what is fitting and act,
see what is not and stop.

All things begin with unity,
time marks their measure—
from ancient times to now, unchanging—
this is called *heavenly principle*.
Unity is the **Dao**’s child,
the ruler’s grasp.
Though ages differ,
their operations do not.
Like an axle turning the hub,
inner governs outer—
the wheel revolves endlessly,
matching heaven’s eternal cycle.

Above, it holds the Great Clarity;
below, it wields its light.
The **Dao** generates all things,
its principle lies in yin and yang,
transforming into the four seasons,
dividing into the Five Phases—
each finds its place.
Following time’s flow,
laws have their constants.
Even the lowly are included,
the **Dao** remains unshaken,
ministers act in harmony—
heaven’s **Dao** is complete without doing,
obtained without seeking.
Thus it is known:
non-doing yet beneficial.

Heaven displays its symbols to illuminate the four quarters,
the ruler establishes laws to govern the world.
The *dìchóng*#2 awakens, the people revive with blessings—
yin and yang never err,
all things have their constancy.
Without non-doing,
how could there be benefit to the state?

In ancient times, **Yao** governed the world while perfecting himself.
The *Laozi* says:
*"The most pristine is formless,
the most vast is boundless.
Thus heaven’s roundness does not fit the compass,
earth’s square does not fit the ruler.
Past and future—this is *zhou*,
the four directions and above and below—this is *yu*.
The **Dao** dwells within yet is nowhere known."*

Thus those who see not far cannot speak of the great,
those who know not broadly cannot discuss the ultimate.
He who aligns with the **Dao** and harmonizes with things
cannot be contradicted.
Moral **Dao** is vast and formless,
heaven and earth are boundless yet measureless;
near as a hair’s breadth yet unseen,
far as the cosmos yet unfathomable.
Unless one is broadly enlightened and harmonious with things,
none can clarify the origin of the ultimate **Dao**,
nor penetrate the realm of indistinct right and wrong.

Thus the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors,
though their laws varied by region,
all won the people’s hearts.
Though their statutes differed,
their reverence for the people was one.

Rules and measures, hooks and lines—
tools of skill,
yet not the skill itself.
Thus *Wén* the lute-maker, though skilled,
could not compose melodies—
only strings could weep alone.
Thus strings are tools of sorrow,
not sorrow itself.
All things, though called natural,
have causes and supports;
none act in isolation.
The hook and line are skill’s contrivance,
yet not skill itself.
Perfection lies in the artisan—
without the line, nothing is straight.
Strings are sorrow’s tool,
yet not sorrow itself—
without strings, there is no sorrow.

When divine harmony plays between heart and hand,
spontaneous expression flows,
melodies arise from the strings—
father cannot teach son,
son cannot learn from father.
This is the **Dao** that cannot be transmitted.

*Wén* played the lute:
his fingers plucked the strings,
his spirit flowed freely between hand and heart,
harmonizing with yin and yang’s rhythms,
thus the music shifted with the seasons.
Qi moved all things—
so profound that even father and son,
though close, could not pass it on.
This is the pinnacle of subtlety.
Thus it is also like the **Dao**—
incapable of transmission.

Reverence is the sovereign of form,
yet silence is the master of sound.
Reverence is stillness—
thus form arises from stillness, ruled by it.
Silence holds sound—
thus emptiness governs it.

The *Laozi* says:
*"Heaven and earth’s **Dao** takes virtue as its master,
the **Dao** gives it its name.
Things regulate themselves;
the most subtle penetrates deeply,
not relying on affairs or rank.
Thus it stands without merit,
is not honored by position,
is not made manifest by name,
does not depend on rites for dignity,
nor on arms for strength."*

The **Dao** gives birth as its decree,
virtue nurtures as its master.

When humans harmonize the **suōng** (冲) qi,
rectify life and nature,
preserve the essence within,
discard external burdens—
why seek name or rank for self-exaltation?
Why rely on arms when all submit?

Thus the **Dao** stands without teaching,
illumination shines without scrutiny.
The **Dao** stands without teaching—
it does not usurp others’ abilities;
illumination shines without scrutiny—
it does not harm their affairs.
When the **Dao** exists, teaching fades;
when clarity is absolute, scrutiny ceases—
only then can one bear great responsibilities without harm.

Those who teach the **Dao** act contrary to virtue,
harming all things.
Thus yin and yang, the four seasons,
metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—
all share the **Dao** yet differ in principle.
All things share sentiment yet differ in form.
The wise do not instruct one another;
the capable do not receive from one another.
Thus the Sage establishes laws to guide the people’s hearts,
letting each return to its natural state.
Thus the living have no cause for virtue,
the dead no cause for grievance.

To act contrary to virtue means
virtue declines while teaching flourishes;
to harm things means
to first diminish oneself while benefiting others.
For the Five Phases differ in nature,
all things vary in form—
teaching has its origins and ends,
people differ in wisdom and folly.
The Sage enacts laws and teachings,
opens the confused and guides the ignorant,
so that the wise may pass knowledge forward,
the capable may not conceal their talents,
each fulfilling their role,
returning to nature.
The living do not boast of their virtue,
the dead do not blame Heaven.

Heaven and Earth are not kind—
they treat all things as sacrificial dogs.
The Sage is not kind—
they treat the people as sacrificial dogs.
Heaven and Earth give birth to all things,
the Sage nourishes the people—
how could they have intentions toward things,
or favoritism toward people?
Viewed as one, they are like sacrificial dogs.

Compassion, love, benevolence, and righteousness—
these are narrow paths.
The narrow confines the great and leads to confusion;
the near obscures the distant and causes bewilderment.
The Sage’s **Dao** enters the great without confusion,
travels far without bewilderment,
constantly empty and self-guarded—
this is the ultimate, called Heaven’s virtue.

**Dao** and virtue are profound and subtle,
benevolence and righteousness are shallow and narrow.
The *Zhongyong* (中庸) takes a minor path to lead to confusion,
the highest Sage ascends the broad way without obstruction.
Unless the spirit is ever-clear,
how could one align with Heaven’s ultimate?

The *Laozi* says:
The Sage covers like Heaven, bears like Earth,
is illuminated by the sun and moon,
harmonizes yin and yang,
transforms through the four seasons,
embraces all things yet does not favor them—
without partiality or preference,
without neglect or closeness.
This is the Sage’s virtue.

Covering and bearing like Heaven and Earth,
illuminating like the sun and moon,
cycling like the four seasons—
all creatures, diverse in kind,
grasses, trees, insects—
each finds rest in its place,
fulfills its nature.
How could there be partiality or preference among them?

Thus those who model Heaven
know Heaven does not act in one season,
Earth does not rely on one material,
humans do not serve one purpose.
Thus undertakings are manifold,
actions are varied.
Speaking of Heaven in one season cannot complete a year,
using Earth with one material exhausts its use.
A single human talent is insufficient for nobility.
Thus in warfare, some are light, some heavy,
some greedy, some frugal—
these four opposites cannot be unified.
Each has its advantage,
so they cannot be one.

The light wish to strike,
the heavy wish to hold firm,
the greedy wish to take,
the frugal find no gain—
not their own.
When armies unite in purpose,
yet the heavy wish to hold,
the light wish to strike,
each pursues their own advantage—
this is not unity.
Without unity, defeat awaits when meeting the enemy.
But if one measures their talents,
balances light and heavy in deployment,
then victory is assured.

Thus the bold may be ordered to advance and fight,
but not to hold firm;
the heavy may be ordered to defend resolutely,
but not to provoke the enemy;
the greedy may be ordered to seize and take,
but not to divide spoils;
the frugal may be ordered to keep their share,
but not to advance and take;
the trustworthy may be ordered to keep agreements,
but not to adapt to changes.

The Sage employs these five talents together,
using each according to their strength—
thus the world has no rival.

Heaven and Earth do not cherish any single thing,
yin and yang do not produce any single kind.
Thus the sea does not refuse the tiniest stream to become vast,
mountains and forests do not refuse the crooked and bent to become towering.
The Sage does not reject the humble words of firewood-gathering
to broaden their renown.

To guard one corner while abandoning the rest,
to take one thing while discarding others—
then what is gained is little,
and what is governed is shallow.
If the **Dao** is not broad,
it cannot embrace all things.
If the Sage’s virtue is not profound,
they cannot receive subtle words.

Thus a single talent is insufficient to serve,
a single region is insufficient to govern.
Those who guard narrowly are limited,
those who serve shallowly are constrained.

The *Laozi* says:
What Heaven covers, what Earth bears,
what the sun and moon illuminate—
forms differ, natures vary,
each finds its place of rest.
What brings joy as joy
is also what brings sorrow.
What brings security as security
is also what brings danger.
To impose one’s joy upon others brings sorrow,
to follow their joy brings joy.
To impose one’s security upon others brings danger,
to follow their life brings security.

Thus the Sage shepherds the people:
letting each follow their nature,
settle where they belong,
act according to their ability,
fulfill their proper role,
apply what is suitable—
then all things align in harmony,
none transgressing.

The Sage shepherds the people:
letting diverse natures and forms
each find their proper place—
though myriad kinds exist,
they function as one body,
none overstepping.
Thus it is called *one harmony*.

Things under Heaven have no inherent nobility or baseness.
To honor what is honored makes all things honored.
To degrade what is degraded makes all things degraded.
Nobility and baseness have no fixed measure,
prosperity and ruin no constant standard—
they depend on fortune and misfortune,
use and disuse.

Thus those who do not exalt the wise
do not cast fish onto trees,
do not drown birds in the deep.
Speak of releasing them to fly in the woods,
of casting them where they swim in water—
then flying and swimming find their place,
through the wise and foolish working together.

The Sage-Kings of old governed the realm:

When Yao ruled the world,
Shun served as Minister of Instruction,
Xiè as Minister of War,
Yu as Minister of Works—
the Three Ministers,
discussing the Dao and administering the state,
harmonizing the principles of yin and yang,
acting as the sovereign’s limbs and voice.

Later, Xièyì cultivated the fields,
teaching the people to sow seeds.
Xī Zhōng became the Master of Works,
crafting tools to meet the people’s needs.
Thus did the Sage employ the worthy.

Their achievements reached to the cosmos,
their virtue flowed to the four seas—
only Heaven was greater,
and Yao followed it alone.

He guided the people:
those dwelling by water fished,
those in the woods gathered,
those in the valleys herded,
those on the hills tilled the land.
The land suited the work,
the work suited the tools,
the tools suited the materials.
Gāo and Zé wove nets,
Líng and Jí plowed the fields—
thus the people exchanged what they lacked
for what they possessed,
their skills for their deficiencies.
So few deserted, many obeyed,
like wind passing through reeds—
suddenly stirring all.

Each responded to purity or turbidity,
seeking what benefited them,
avoiding what harmed them.
Thus neighboring states lay within sight,
the sounds of roosters and dogs carried on the breeze,
yet no footsteps crossed the borders of the lords,
no chariot tracks stretched beyond a thousand li—
all content in their homes.

The Sage’s Way governed the people:
settling them where their strengths lay,
establishing them where it suited them,
so that abundance and scarcity supported one another,
skill and clumsiness complemented each other.
Like wind passing through a reed,
moistening what it touched,
its sound followed what it stirred,
things responded to what benefited them.
Thus neighboring states lay within sight—
weapons unused,
the people living out their days in peace.

So chaotic states seemed full,
well-ordered ones seemed empty,
declining ones seemed lacking,
thriving ones seemed abundant.
The "empty" were not without people,
but each held to their duties;
the "full" were not overpopulated,
but all were fixated on trifles;
the "abundant" were not rich in wealth,
but their desires were restrained and their undertakings few;
the "lacking" were not poor in goods,
but their people were few and their expenditures great.

Understanding these four truths
reveals the roots of order and chaos,
discerns the fate of survival and ruin.

Thus the ancient kings’ laws were not their own creation,
but what they followed.
Their punishments were not their own invention,
but what they upheld—
the Way of Supreme Virtue.

Punishments were not meant to kill,
but to set boundaries.
Yet the foolish did not heed their commands,
and multiplied their transgressions—
thus they invited death.

Laozi said:
To govern the world with the Dao
is not to alter human nature,
but to nurture what already exists,
expanding it fully—
thus following is vast,
forcing is small.

Ancient dike-builders followed the river’s flow,
farmers followed the land’s suitability,
warriors followed the people’s will—
to follow is to be unconquerable under Heaven.

Things must first exist naturally
before human affairs can be ordered.
Observing that all things have inherent natures,
one then aligns with their suitability,
follows the people’s desires—
then undertakings succeed without fail,
actions bring no harm.

Thus the ancient kings’ laws
regulated human nature with measured restraints.
What lacked that nature could not be made to conform,
what had it but lacked resources could not be made to obey the Way.
Wood cannot be made to rise from water,
metal cannot be made to generate fire.

Humans possess the potential for benevolence and righteousness,
yet without the Sage’s guidance,
laws and measures cannot make them align.
By prohibiting what they hate,
delinquency is checked—
punishments unused, authority moves like a god.

Follow their nature, and the world obeys;
contradict it, and laws are issued in vain.
Morality and virtue,
though rooted in human nature,
require the Sage-King’s laws to take form.
By wielding rewards and punishments,
guiding with virtue,
aligning with ritual,
enforcing with law—
only then can nature be bent to purpose,
though it resists.

Follow their nature, and response is divine;
contradict it, and even commands go unheeded.

Morality and virtue
are the foundation of merit and renown,
what the people cherish—
when cherished, merit and renown stand firm.
Without morality and virtue,
no merit or renown can be established.

The ancient wise rulers modeled themselves on the rivers and seas:
the rivers and seas act without effort to become great,
humble themselves to become vast—
thus they endure as Heaven’s valleys,
their virtue sufficient.
Without action, they receive all streams;
without seeking, they obtain;
without striving, they arrive—
thus they hold the world.
They do not claim what they possess,
so they grow rich;
they do not flaunt what they know,
so they become clear;
they do not boast of their strength,
so they endure;
they dwell in what is not theirs,
so they rule the world.
They do not contend,
so none can contend with them.
They do not vie for greatness,
so they achieve it.

The rivers and seas are close to the Dao,
thus they endure alongside Heaven and Earth,
their virtue complete.
Without claiming,
they grow strong;
strong yet not violent toward others,
their Dao deep,
their virtue profound—
thus their merit and renown are fulfilled.
This is called the Mysterious Virtue,
profound and distant,
contrary to all things.

The world values the exalted,
I embrace the lowly;
the world prizes boasting,
I avoid contention;
I dwell where none claim to be—
thus I am contrary to all things.

The world has a beginning,
yet none knows its principle—
only the Sage understands its source.
Neither male nor female,
neither yin nor yang,
it generates yet does not die.

Heaven and Earth were completed,
yin and yang took form,
and all things were born.
Thus yin and yang have round and square,
short and long,
existence and nonexistence—
the Dao names them.

Obscure and deep,
yet without action,
in the heart it is subtle,
in the Dao it is right.
Life and death share the same principle,
all transformations merge into the One Way.
Forgotten in birth,
unaware of death—
where could one not live long?

Abandon deeds and words,
be cautious in non-action.
Guard the Dao with thoroughness,
do not lord over things.
The most subtle, formless—
this is the end.

The beginning of Heaven and Earth,
all things align with the Dao yet manifest in diverse forms.
The most subtle holds nothing within,
thus it can encompass and care for all.
The most vast has no outer limit,
thus it becomes all things.
The most minute contains nothing inside,
thus it is the source of all things’ worth.
The Dao preserves life,
virtue stabilizes form.
The utmost Dao’s measure:
abandoning preference and aversion,
without knowing—
harmonizing intent, calming the heart,
never opposing the Dao.

Heaven and Earth have a beginning—
this is the Dao.
None in the world can recognize it,
for it cannot be distinguished as male or female,
nor traced through form and color.
Yet though sought, it is nowhere found,
though spoken of, it cannot be grasped—
and yet it endures eternally.
Heaven and Earth have high and low positions,
the sun and moon have day and night’s order,
yin and yang have firm and yielding principles,
all things have long and short natures—
yet the Dao is neither obscure nor clear,
neither existent nor nonexistent,
neither vast nor minute,
neither round nor square.
Its revolutions know no end,
its transformations have no fixed pattern.

Yet those who revere it
preserve life and stabilize form,
abandon deeds and words,
vast and effortless, serene and yielding—
thus they return to the Great Primordial,
entering the realm of boundless virtue and longevity.

Heaven and Earth, when unified, become One;
when divided, they become Two.
When reversed, they reunite,
above and below unbroken.
When unified, they become One;
when divided, they become Five.
When reversed, they reunite—
necessarily conforming to the compass and square.

One is the diffusion of *qi*,
Two is the flow of form,
Five are the Five Phases.
Above and below are Heaven and Earth,
and the person between them—
if they harmonize with Heaven and Earth’s virtue,
unify their essence into One,
they necessarily conform to the laws,
and return to the origin.

The Dao is most intimate yet cannot be neglected,
most near yet cannot be distanced.
Seeking it far away,
one goes forth and returns in vain.
Seeking it in things,
none know to seek it within oneself.

Laozi said:
*The Emperor* has a name,
yet none know its essence.
*The Emperor* values virtue,
the King upholds righteousness,
the Conqueror grasps principle.
Virtue nurtures all things,
righteousness rescues the drowning and aids the endangered,
principle responds to circumstances and numbers.

The Sage’s Way in things is nonexistent.
Only when virtue is insufficient does one employ intelligence,
when virtue is thin does one resort to punishment,
when wisdom is shallow does one rely on scrutiny.
Those who rely on intelligence bring chaos to the heart,
those who rely on punishment invite grievance from above and below,
those who rely on scrutiny prompt the lower ranks to feign virtue to please above—
thus harming the truth.
Intelligence spawns deception,
punishment breeds legal trickery,
virtue arises from hypocrisy.
When these three corrupt,
the Sage prohibits them—
none can overcome them.
The harm of straying from the Dao lies here.

Thus the Sage follows Heaven and Earth’s transformations,
adapting virtue accordingly.
Heaven covers, Earth bears,
guiding by season—
its nourishment is profound,
and profound nourishment brings order.
Order and chaos—
though there be sages and gods,
how could they alter it?

Abandon the mind’s schemes,
reduce punishments,
return to clarity and stillness—
things will self-regulate.
The Dao as ruler,
like a solemn corpse in silent repose,
yet the world receives its blessings.
One person benefits without favor,
ten thousand benefit without partiality.

Thus excessive kindness is folly,
excessive severity is tyranny—
both oppose the Dao.
Kindness is giving without measure.
The Sage observes the times’ corruption,
the reliance on deceitful intelligence.
Thus he steadies with virtue and morality,
returns to clarity and stillness,
leaving things to self-regulate,
guarding the mysterious and silent.
Restoring them to simplicity,
kindness is not recklessly bestowed,
punishment not recklessly imposed—
thus tyranny and chaos do not arise,
and all conform to the Dao.

Bestowing rewards without merit,
granting honors without labor—
those who fulfill their duties grow negligent in office,
while the idle rush forward in ambition.
Tyranny is unjust slaughter,
the innocent dying,
those who follow the Dao being punished—
thus those who cultivate themselves are discouraged from virtue,
while the wicked dare to defy above.

Thus excessive kindness breeds deceit,
excessive severity breeds chaos—
deceit and chaos are the customs of a dying state.

Punishment cannot be imposed on the virtuous,
honors cannot be bestowed without merit—
thus those who fulfill their duties show signs of neglect,
those who follow the Dao harbor resentment.
This is the deceit and chaos,
the customs of a dying state.

Thus when the state executes,
the ruler feels no anger;
when the court rewards,
the sovereign takes no credit.
The executed bear no grudge—
punishment is justly meted out—
the rewarded do not feel indebted to above—
merit is naturally achieved.
The people know
that executions and rewards arise from their own actions,
thus they strive for merit and cultivate their endeavors,
not relying on others’ gifts.
Hence the court is uncluttered, with no traces of corruption,
fields lie fallow without filth.

Rewards suffice to encourage virtue,
punishments suffice to deter deceit.
The rewarded feel no danger from arrogance,
the punished feel no pity—
thus the near benefit from its grace,
the distant submit to its virtue.
If they perfect their endeavors and exhaust their strength,
the court knows no disputes,
the fields flourish with crops.

Thus the *Taishang* knows and possesses it.
Speaking of the ancient *Taishang*’s Dao,
later kings took it as their model.

The Way of the King
handles affairs of non-action,
practices teaching without words,
remains serene and unmoved,
measures once and does not waver,
follows naturally without forcing,
achieves results without labor,
plans without error,
acts without fault,
speaks without rhetoric,
moves without display—
advancing and retreating suit the time,
action and stillness follow principle.

Neither praising beauty nor hating ugliness,
neither rewarding nor punishing with joy or anger,
each name is self-bestowed,
each category self-classified,
matters proceed naturally—
none originate from the self.

If one seeks to constrain it,
one only drives it away.
If one seeks to adorn it,
one only robs it of its essence.

The King, unless vast, cannot contain all things,
unless still, cannot harmonize the people.
Abandoning preference and aversion,
cherishing simplicity and authenticity—
narrowness without intimacy,
ornament without harming substance,
all things, diverse in kind,
naturally return to their own.

Heaven’s *qi* is the spirit,
Earth’s *qi* is the vital breath—
reversed, they are profound and mysterious,
each occupying its dwelling,
guarded without loss,
ascending to the Supreme Unity.
The essence of the Supreme Unity
unifies and merges with Heaven.

The Dao of Heaven is silent and indistinct,
without measure or standard.
Its greatness cannot be fathomed,
its depth cannot be plumbed.
It ever transforms with humanity,
yet wisdom cannot grasp it.
Its turning is endless like a wheel,
its transformation as wondrous as the divine.
In emptiness it follows naturally,
always acting after, never before.

The human *hun* is yang, life, received from Heaven.
The *po* is yin, death, received from Earth.
Each guards its own dwelling.
The *hun* is the spirit of yang,
the *po* is the essence of yin.
*Hun* and *po* are the utmost essence of Heaven and Earth—
thus they are called profound and mysterious.
Heaven gains them and remains ever luminous,
humans gain them and remain ever alive—
thus it is said: *guard them lest they be lost*,
and ascend to the Supreme Unity.
The Supreme Unity is the Sovereign of the Highest Dao.
What humans receive from it—
if one guards one’s spirit and essence,
lest they abandon the body,
then one unites above with Heaven.

The Supreme Unity focuses its essence and accumulates its thoughts,
thus it is able to communicate.
The method of guarding it:
only stillness, only silence,
without measure or standard,
without greatness or boundary—
its subtlety is unfathomable.
Thus it is said:
it ever transforms with humanity,
yet wisdom cannot grasp it.
Its turning is like a wheel,
its transformation as wondrous as the divine.
In emptiness it acts after, never before.
In obscurity it enlightens—
thus it is called the utmost truth.

In governing, it maintains a vacant heart and weak will,
clear and bright without darkness,
thus ministers gather like spokes to the hub.
Whether wise or foolish, virtuous or base,
all exhaust their abilities.
The ruler gains the means to govern his ministers,
the ministers gain the means to serve their ruler—
thus the governance of the state becomes manifest.

He who possesses a clear mirror
will see the purest essence.
In governing the state, ministers vie to honor him.
If he does not lightly risk his body,
then ten thousand armies will guard him without abandon.

Laozi said:
He who knows and loves to ask is sage,
he who is courageous and loves to ask is victorious.
He who rides upon the wisdom of the masses
can undertake any task,
he who employs the strength of the masses
can overcome any challenge.
To employ the strength of the masses,
even Wu Ge is insufficient to rely upon.
To ride upon the momentum of the masses,
even the world is insufficient to use.
The skilled user of the masses
finds none stronger than himself.

Employing the masses’ strength,
even mountains and hills, though heavy,
can be moved by their momentum.
Employing the masses’ wisdom,
even ghosts and gods, though hidden,
can be clarified by their reasoning.
Without strategy, no force can prevail,
yet without adhering to principle,
even the sage cannot succeed.

When schemes are laid bare,
even a commoner can wield a crossbow of ten thousand *jin*.
When reason is perverted,
even the sage cannot bend a child’s words.

Thus the sage, in all undertakings,
never fails to utilize their resources.

He who has one talent occupies one post,
he who has one ability serves one task.
If strength exceeds the task, the burden is not heavy,
if ability exceeds the task, the labor is not difficult.
The sage employs all together,
thus no person is discarded,
no material wasted.
Utilizing their talents, all exhaust their abilities.
Utilizing their strengths, all give their utmost.

Laozi said:
So-called *wuwei* is not
that which, when pulled, does not come,
when pushed, does not go,
when pressed, does not respond,
when moved, does not stir,
when stagnant, does not flow,
when gathered, does not disperse.
Only he who adapts and follows the times,
responding to things without obstruction,
is called *wuwei*.
It is said:
his private desires do not intrude upon public duty,
his appetites do not cling to proper conduct.
He acts in accordance with principle,
achieves success through resources,
pushes natural momentum—
artifice finds no place.
When deeds are accomplished, he does not boast,
when merit is established, he does not claim it.

As water uses a boat,
sand uses a plow,
earth uses a cart,
mountains use a ladder—
summer floods, winter pools,
using height to make mountains,
using low to make ponds—
these are not my doings.
Each employs what is advantageous,
all gain their convenience.
Thus it is said: *not my doing*.

The sage does not shame his humble station,
but despises the Dao’s obstruction.
He does not grieve over short life,
but over the people’s hardship.
Thus he remains ever vacant and does nothing,
embracing simplicity, seeing purity,
not mingling with things.
Ever aligning with the Dao,
not mingling with things.

Laozi said:
The ancient emperors were not established
to indulge their desires,
the sages who ascended the throne
did not seek ease for themselves.
For the people of the world,
the strong oppressed the weak,
the many oppressed the few,
the cunning deceived the simple,
the brave intimidated the timid.
Again, the wise hoarded knowledge without teaching,
accumulated wealth without sharing—
thus the Son of Heaven was established to unify them.
For one man’s wisdom could not illuminate the land,
thus the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers were established to assist.
For isolated states and disparate customs could not receive his blessings,
thus the feudal lords were established to instruct them.
Thus Heaven and Earth, the four seasons—
none fail to respond.
No official hides his duties,
no state neglects its benefits.
Thus the cold are clothed, the hungry fed,
the aged and weak cared for,
the weary rested—
none are left unprovided.

The sage in high station
does not seek to exalt his position or delight his body,
but to rest the people and relieve their hardships.
Thus the Son of Heaven holds the One to unify,
the Three Dukes discuss the Dao to rectify,
the Nine Ministers uphold the law to assist,
the feudal lords proclaim teachings to honor.
Thus near and far follow the same winds,
ruler and ministers share one intent,
officials hold no false emoluments,
markets know no deceitful profits.

Thus the *Shijing* says:
*"With enlightened virtue and conduct,
the four quarters submit to it."*

Shennong’s form was emaciated,
Yao was gaunt and withered,
Shun was swarthy and black,
Yu’s hands and feet were calloused.
Yi Yin carried a cauldron to serve Tang,
Jiang Ziya wielded a butcher’s cleaver to enter Zhou,
Bai Li Xi was sold as a slave,
Guan Zhong was bound in chains,
Confucius lacked a black ox for sacrifice,
Mozi had no warm seat—
not for greed of office or lust for rank,
but to awaken the world’s benefits,
to remove the people’s harms.

From the Son of Heaven down to the common people,
their bodies unexerted, their minds untroubled,
yet they seek ease in all matters—
this has never been heard of.

From Shennong onward,
their forms were emaciated, their hands and feet calloused,
not to seek honor by dwelling above the people,
but to fulfill the intent of saving all things.

Never has there been one who sat in ease and awaited emolument,
or who reaped millet without tilling the fields.

Laozi said:
*"What is called the Son of Heaven*
is one who upholds the **Dao/Way** to establish the world.

The **Dao/Way** of establishing the world
is to grasp the One as its foundation,
to return to the root and act without contrivance,
to remain empty and tranquil, without possession,
to drift beyond measure, without boundary,
to extend infinitely, without end—
to observe it, there is no form,
to listen to it, there is no sound.
This is called the **Great Dao/Way’s** essence.

It aligns with the previous explanation.

Laozi said:
The **Dao/Way** is
a rounded body yet square in its methods,
a back that shelters darkness while embracing brightness,
a left that yields softness and a right that wields firmness,
a tread upon the unseen while bearing the luminous—
its transformations are without constancy,
yet it draws from the origin of the One to respond without fixed form.
This is called **Divine Mystery**.

Now, humanity—
its head is round like Heaven,
its feet are square like Earth,
its back shelters darkness while its face embraces brightness,
its left hand holds softness, its right hand holds firmness,
its feet traverse the Nine Abysses,
its head bears the Three Luminaries—
endlessly revolving, its brilliance illuminating the four quarters;
unchanging yet ever-turning,
this is called **Divine Mystery**.
Those who behold it prosper.

Heaven is round yet without end,
so its form cannot be observed.
Earth is square yet without boundary,
so its gate cannot be glimpsed.
Heaven’s transformations follow without defined shape,
Earth’s growth extends without measure.
Endless in their transformations,
even the most enlightened cannot see their forms.
Boundless in their generation,
even the most skilled cannot calculate their numbers.

Among things, there is none that surpasses the **Dao/Way**,
yet the **Dao/Way** itself has no surpassing—
for it is without constant form or measure.
Endlessly revolving,
it mirrors the cycles of the sun and moon,
or the succession of the four seasons—
day and night, the sun and moon,
end and begin again,
brightness and then obscurity,
shaping form yet remaining formless—
thus its work can be accomplished.
It nourishes all things yet is not possessed by them—
thus it prevails without bending.

Form arises from the formless,
so form persists without cessation.
Things arise from the **Dao/Way** yet are not constrained by it,
so it nourishes all things without end.

The **Emperor** is one who wages war in the **Temple of Dao/Way**,
the **King** is one who manifests **Divine Mystery**.
The **Emperor** wages war in the **Temple of Dao/Way** by aligning with Heaven’s **Dao/Way**,
the **King** manifests **Divine Mystery** by illuminating the four seasons,
adjusting governance within his realm,
while distant lands reverence his virtue.
He prevails in battle before it is fought,
and the feudal lords come as guests, submitting in service.

The **Emperor** wages war in the **Temple of Dao/Way** by wielding the **Dao/Way** to conquer,
the **King** manifests **Divine Mystery** by triumphing in battle.
When forced to use them, they are employed.

The ancient ones who attained the **Dao/Way**
were tranquil yet governed Heaven and Earth,
active yet harmonized with the sun and moon,
their joy and anger conformed to the four seasons,
their commands echoed like thunder and lightning,
their breath and **qi** aligned with the Eight Winds,
their yielding and firmness never transgressed the Five Degrees.

Those who attained the **Dao/Way**,
their joy and anger never issued without cause,
their commands never applied without reason—
they governed like Heaven and Earth,
they followed like the sun and moon.
Thus the Eight Winds did not clash,
and the Five Stars did not stray.

They followed the people’s desires,
they harnessed the people’s strength,
to remove their excesses and eliminate their harms.

Those who share the same benefits
perish together,
those who share the same emotions
are fulfilled together,
those who share the same actions
assist each other—
if each follows their own path,
the world becomes a battleground.

Thus, the adept in warfare
uses the people’s own strength for their own ends,
while the incompetent
uses the people’s strength for their own ends.
Using the people’s strength for their own ends,
the world cannot fail to be employed.
Using the people’s strength for one’s own ends,
no single person can be employed.

Remove their harms,
and though the world is vast,
they will serve you of their own accord.
Deny their desires,
and though you are few,
they will not submit to you.

The **virtue/power** of lesser attainment
has its times of decline and excess,
hence virtue has its high and low.

The **Dao/Way**-less sovereigns shine with manifest virtue,
yet this does not mean supreme virtue—
thus it is called *lesser virtue*.

Laozi says:
To govern the self, the highest is the ancient, mysterious sovereign.
To nurture the spirit, take emptiness and clarity as the foundation.
Next, to nurture the form, take desires as the foundation.

When the spirit is clear and the mind is even,
all limbs are at peace—
this is the foundation of nurturing life.

Plump flesh, filled intestines,
satisfying desires—
these are the trivialities of nurturing life.

The spirit is the foundation of life,
the form is the triviality of life.
Attaining the foundation preserves the form and aligns with the **Dao/Way**,
while overvaluing the triviality causes the form to perish and return to the earth.

The sages of antiquity prioritized the foundation and did not indulge the trivial,
finding balance in moderation.
Later ages abandoned the spirit and indulged the form—
this is truly excessive.

To govern the realm, the highest is to nurture transformation.
This is to transform through the **Dao/Way**.
Next is to rectify the laws—
meaning penal codes.

When people naturally yield to one another,
strive for humility,
contend for lesser gains,
and take on laborious tasks,
day by day they transform toward the superior,
unaware of how it happens—
this is the foundation of governance,
the highest transformation.

With generous rewards encouraging virtue
and fear of punishment preventing wrongdoing,
when laws are properly established above,
the people submit below—
this is the triviality of governance.

Later ages govern through the trivial,
while earlier ages nurtured the foundation.
First, one discusses governing the self,
then one can govern the realm.

Having a foundation means having a triviality,
just as a whole form brings blessing to the body.
Thus, when one knows the **Dao/Way** and virtue is complete,
the roots of right and wrong are severed,
but when laws are enforced, paths of contention open.

The sage suppresses the trivial and upholds the foundation—
how could this not have its reasons?

Laozi says:
The ruler who seeks to govern does not appear in every age,
the capable minister who can assist does not appear in every thousand.
To seek such a ruler with such a minister—
this is why perfect governance appears only once in a thousand years.

This speaks of the rarity of enlightened rulers and virtuous ministers,
not that they never exist in any dynasty.
To discuss the worthy and the unworthy,
their use or disuse,
is not like the case of King Wen’s teacher, Ji Fang,
or King Wu Ding’s search for the oracle bone master.

If one seeks such figures exhaustively,
one would not encounter a single ruler in ten thousand years,
nor a single minister in a thousand—
who then would govern the world?

The achievements of hegemons and kings
are not established in every age.
This means they do not arise in every generation,
but the wise occupy them.

If one follows their good intentions
and guards against their corrupt hearts,
aligning with the people in the same **Dao/Way**,
then the people can be made virtuous,
and customs refined.

What makes the sage noble is not their imposition of punishments for crimes,
but their understanding of where disorder arises.

If one opens the sharp edges of vice
and lets them run wild in licentiousness,
then abandons them to laws and follows with punishments,
even if they destroy the world,
they cannot suppress their deceit.

Laws prevent what has not yet occurred,
punishments correct what has already happened.
Yet laws must not be乱 (*luàn*—chaotic),
punishments must not be滥 (*làn*—excessive),
for chaos makes them hard to uphold,
and excess harms the innocent—
even if they slaughter ten thousand households,
the wickedness will not cease.

Laozi says:
To stand above the rivers and seas,
yet have the heart beneath the imperial gate—
this is to *heavy life*.
To *heavy life* is to burden one’s existence.
To *heavy life* is to be burdened by desires,
yet still unable to overcome them—
if one follows them, the spirit suffers no harm.
If one cannot overcome them yet forcibly resists,
this is called *double injury*.
Those with *double injury* have no longevity.

The mind cannot serve two purposes at once,
nor can two affairs arise simultaneously.
Just as one stands in a secluded, open place
yet longs for a scene of splendor and honor—
if one abandons the body to follow the mind,
one can avoid burden.
But if one suppresses the body and defies the mind,
the two hearts war within—
this is called *double injury*.
To pray for longevity while bearing *double injury*—
this is no empty boast.

Thus it is said:
To know harmony is to know constancy,
to know constancy is to know enlightenment.
To increase life is auspicious,
to let the mind direct the *qi* is strength—
this is called *mysterious unity*.

Using its radiance,
it returns to its clarity.
Bathing the spirit in harmony,
harmony makes one constant with Heaven and Earth;
unifying the *qi* with enlightenment,
enlightenment makes one luminous with the sun and moon.

Laozi says:
Nothing is easier than doing good,
nothing is harder than doing evil.

What is called *doing good* is
to be still and do nothing,
to follow nature and avoid excess,
to avoid temptations,
to follow one’s true nature and preserve integrity,
to remain unchanging in oneself—
thus it is said that *doing good is easy*.

What is called *doing evil* is difficult—
usurpation, regicide, deceit, and haste,
with many desires—
these are not human nature,
thus it is said that *doing evil is hard*.

Generally, people find it easy to do good
but difficult to do evil.
Yet what is now considered a great calamity
arises from the lack of constancy in moderation.

Thus, in places of gain and loss,
at the juncture of fortune and misfortune,
one must be discerning.

The sage has no desires,
no evasions.
If one desires something,
pursuing it only leads to its loss;
if one avoids something,
avoiding it only leads to its approach.

When the will has desires,
it forgets its purpose.
Thus the sage examines the shifts between action and stillness,
adjusting the measure of giving and receiving,
balancing love and hate,
harmonizing joy and anger.

If action and stillness are balanced,
calamity will not assail.
If giving and receiving are measured,
guilt will not burden.
If love and hate are reasoned,
worry will not approach.
If joy and anger are harmonized,
grievance will not offend.

Those who embody the **Dao/Way**
do not seek gain lightly,
do not shun disaster,
and what they do not abandon, they do not control.
They are always full yet never overflowing,
constantly empty yet easily sustained.

Thus, if one governs by **Dao/Way** and measure,
food fills the empty,
clothing wards off cold,
sufficient for warmth and nourishment in a seven-foot frame.
Without **Dao/Way** and measure,
even with the power of a great state,
it is insufficient for satisfaction;
even with the wealth of the world,
it is insufficient for joy.

If one truly knows contentment,
even a single gourd’s worth is abundant,
but if one is insatiable,
even ruling the world is insufficient.

Thus the sage’s mind is even,
their will is simple,
their spirit internally guarded—
external things cannot deceive them.

When the mind is preserved in tranquility and harmony,
how can external things overwhelm one’s emotions and desires?

Laozi said:
*"He who overcomes others has strength,
but he who overcomes himself is truly powerful."*

One who can be powerful must rely on others’ strength;
one who relies on others’ strength must win their hearts;
one who wins hearts must first attain self-mastery.
There has never been one who gained others while losing themselves,
nor one who lost themselves while gaining others.

This is to say:
*"The soft overcomes the hard,
the weak obtains the strong."*

Strength lies not in oneself but in the multitude—
so I embrace all strength without losing others’ strength.
Dominion lies not in oneself but in the hearts of the people—
so all hearts become mine, and thus I win their hearts.

Therefore, the foundation of governance lies in calming the people;
the means to calm them is in ensuring their sufficiency;
the root of sufficiency is in not disrupting the seasons;
the way to not disrupt the seasons is in reducing labor;
the root of reducing labor is in moderating expenditure;
the root of moderating expenditure is in eliminating arrogance;
the root of eliminating arrogance is in embracing emptiness and nothingness.

This means the ruler does not build lofty pavilions or expand vast parks—
then the people will diligently farm without their time being stolen.

The nature of arrogance and excess,
the craving for splendor and luxury,
cannot be abandoned unless rooted in emptiness and **Dao/Way-virtue**.
Thus, one who understands the nature of life
does not pursue what life cannot provide;
one who understands the nature of fate
does not worry over what fate cannot alter.

Knowing life and fate—
what need is there for worry or fear?
Delighting in the five colors,
indulging in flavors,
listening to the five tones—
the seven orifices contend,
harming the single **qi-nature**.
Daily indulging in perverse desires,
exhausting the natural harmony—
the body cannot even be governed,
how much less the world?

The one who truly gains the world
does not claim it by seizing power or titles,
but by aligning the world’s heart and harnessing its strength.

To have the name of ruler without a single person’s loyalty—
this is to have lost the world.
Thus, Jie and Zhou were not true kings,
while Tang and Wu were not rebels.

When the world follows the **Dao/Way**,
its defense lies in the four frontier regions;
when the world loses the **Dao/Way**,
its defense lies with the feudal lords.
When feudal lords follow the **Dao/Way**,
their defense lies in their borders;
when they lose the **Dao/Way**,
their defense lies with their closest retainers.

Thus it is said:
*"Do not rely on others not taking from you,
but on your inability to be taken from."*
To practice a path that can be seized
while rejecting usurpation and regicide
is of no benefit in holding the world.

The sage governs the world
by cultivating the self and calming the people,
not by chasing titles or power.
Thus, those who follow the **Dao/Way** are revered,
while those without **virtue/power** are abandoned.
The world is not a private possession—
only the good are worthy of it.

Laozi said:
*"The wise ruler does not alter established ways,
nor change what is constant."*

Anger is contrary to **virtue/power**,
weapons are instruments of calamity,
and contention is the source of disorder.
Plotting in secret goes against **virtue/power**,
delighting in weapons exacerbates disorder,
and governing through contention is the height of perversity.

No one can bring calamity upon others
without first cultivating it within themselves.
Instead, blunt their sharpness,
resolve their conflicts,
harmonize their brilliance,
and blend their dust.
Human nature desires to excel over others
and resents those who surpass them.
Desiring to excel breeds contention;
resenting others breeds grievance and strife.
Grievance and strife disrupt the mind and invert the **qi**.
Thus, ancient sage-kings eliminated contention and grievance—
when grievance and strife do not arise,
the mind is ordered and the **qi** flows smoothly.

Therefore it is said:
*"Do not exalt the worthy,
so that the people do not contend."*

To uphold the **Dao/Way** and guard constancy is the sage’s governance;
to indulge in confusion and invert **virtue/power** is the fool’s rule.
If the path of exalting the worthy is not opened,
how can the calamity of resentment be avoided?

Laozi said:
*"To govern things, one does not rely on things to achieve harmony;
to govern harmony, one does not rely on harmony to govern people;
to govern people, one does not rely on people to govern the ruler;
to govern the ruler, one does not rely on the ruler to govern desires;
to govern desires, one does not rely on desires to govern nature;
to govern nature, one does not rely on nature to govern **virtue/power**;
to govern **virtue/power**, one does not rely on **virtue/power** to govern the **Dao/Way**.*

Without harmony, one cannot govern things;
without the ruler, one cannot govern people;
without nature, one cannot fulfill **virtue/power**;
without **virtue/power**, one cannot illuminate the **Dao/Way**.

Rooting the **Dao/Way** in human nature—
untainted, enduring in all things—
this is to return to its origin and align with its true nature.

Clothing, food, rites, and customs
are not inherent to human nature;
they are acquired from without.
The **Dao/Way** serves to tranquilize the spirit,
while things nourish the nature.

Nature is the inner self;
things are the external world.
Seeking external things with the inner nature,
when they arrive, they fulfill its inherent demands,
becoming the natural order of that nature.

Thus, those who follow the **Dao/Way** can abandon things and return to the self.
Returning to the self reveals the sincere desires of one’s original nature—
then all things rest in harmony.

Human nature is inherently balanced;
desires corrupt it.
Only those who follow the **Dao/Way** can abandon things and return to the self.
With self-awareness, one does not lose sight of things’ true essence;
without self-awareness, one is misled by constant scheming.

To indulge desires is to lose one’s nature;
every action is misaligned—
governing life leads to self-ruin,
governing the state leads to chaos.
Thus, without understanding the **Dao/Way**, one cannot return to nature.
From governing things to cultivating the **Dao/Way**,
none have ever been properly aligned.

Illness arises from desire.
Desire is the root of calamity,
the gateway to disaster—
without clarifying **Dao/Way-virtue**, one cannot restore the true self.

Ancient sages attained this from within themselves,
thus their commands were obeyed and prohibitions respected.
In all undertakings, one must first calm the mind and clarify the spirit.
Only when the spirit is clear and the mind composed
can affairs be properly ordered.
If judgment is clouded by praise or blame,
if the eyes are dazzled by colors,
how can affairs be rightly governed?
Thus, emptiness is held in highest regard.

Water, when stirred, creates waves;
**qi**, when disordered, brings confusion.
Confused wisdom cannot be relied upon for rectitude,
turbulent water cannot be still.
Thus, the sage-king holds to the One
to regulate the emotions and nature of things.

The One is the most precious—
it has no fixed place in the world.
The sage-king entrusts himself to this boundlessness,
thus commanding the world’s fate.

「The attainment of **Dao/Way** within oneself lies in calming the mind.
The mind’s composure comes from the heart not being swayed by external things,
the eyes not fixated on colors,
unifying the spirit and harmonizing joy and anger,
thus attaining to the **qi**’s purity untainted by passions,
and the passions’ waves not rising.
All follow their nature in reverse,
yet none dare defy the sovereign’s command.

Laozi said:
Yin and Yang nurture all things,
all born riding upon the **One Qi**.
When ruler and subject are estranged, **qi** ascends and churns above;
When the sovereign and ministers are discordant, the five grains fail to flourish.
Spring’s harshness and autumn’s withering,
winter’s thunder and summer’s frost—
all these are born of the **Dao/Way**’s violators.

Between heaven and earth, a single person’s body;
Within the six extremes, a single person’s form.
One person—**the Son of Heaven**.
One person upright, and the world attains peace;
One person corrupt, and all peoples suffer harm.
Thus, bound to heaven and earth,
penetrating the six extremes,
how can one be too cautious?

Those who are clear about their nature
cannot be coerced by heaven and earth;
Those who are precise with **symbols/rituals**
cannot be misled by strange creatures.
When nature aligns with truth,
thunder and lightning press yet do not frighten.
When clarity illuminates all things,
Yin and Yang confuse yet none dare doubt.

The sage discerns the near to know the far,
treating ten thousand miles as one realm.
What is gained within is made manifest without;
What is mastered in the One permeates all.
When **qi** churns within heaven and earth,
rituals and propriety are not established,
and all peoples dare to encroach and oppress,
arising from the depths of **mixed chaos**.
Accumulated virtue receives the **spirit’s** aid,
accumulated vice incurs the **spirit’s** blame.
Yet **qi** of like kind calls to like—
virtue and vice hold no distinction.
Do not say that within **mixed chaos** there is no effect of retribution.

When shame and modesty decline,
and in times of societal decay,
efforts multiply yet wealth dwindles,
labor is excessive yet sustenance insufficient,
the people grow poor and wrathful, strife arising—
thus, **ren** is held in highest regard.
**Ren** brings peace.

When people are coarse and unaligned,
clustering in factions and cliques,
each advancing their own,
nurturing deceitful and cunning schemes—
thus, **yì/rightness** is held in highest regard.
**Yì** cuts through the excess.

When men and women dwell together in groups,
unrestrained and without distinction—
thus, **lǐ/ritual** is held in highest regard.
**Lǐ** brings order.

When natural impulses grow wild,
pressing upon one another beyond restraint,
disharmony arises—
thus, **yuè/music** is held in highest regard.
**Yuè** brings moderation.

Thus, **ren**, **yì**, **lǐ**, and **yuè**—
these are means to remedy failure,
not universal paths to governance.
To value **ren** alone
is not to save what is flawed—
this is not the **ultimate virtue/power**.

If truly one can establish the **spirit’s** clarity throughout the world,
and return the heart to its origin,
then the people’s nature becomes good.
When the people’s nature is good,
heaven and earth, Yin and Yang, follow and embrace them,
then wealth is abundant and people are nourished,
and the hearts of greed, coarseness, and strife cannot arise.
**Ren** and **yì** are not needed,
yet **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way** are established in the world,
and the people do not indulge in colors.

Thus, when **virtue/power** declines, **ren** and **yì** are adorned;
When harmony is lost, music is praised;
When **ritual/lǐ** grows licentious, outward decorum is emphasized.
Hence, one must first know **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**
before understanding that **ren** and **yì** are insufficient to practice;
One must first know **ren** and **yì**
before understanding that **ritual/lǐ** and **yuè/music** are insufficient to cultivate.

**Virtue/power** and **Dao/Way** encompass all beneath heaven.
Thus, those who possess the **Dao/Way** include **ren**, **yì**, **lǐ**, and **yuè**,
holding them all in readiness.

Some say to abandon and extinguish these four
and claim to possess the **Dao/Way**—
this is not a comprehensive view.

The sage-king pities the world’s decline,
yet without **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,
thus values **ren**, **yì**, **lǐ**, and **yuè**,
restraining nature and harmonizing emotions,
preserving propriety and reverence,
exalting respect and yielding,
so none dare overstep—
to restore **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**.

Laozi said:
Governance through **qīngjìng**—
harmonious and yielding, yet tranquil and still,
simple and true, natural and unadorned,
quiet and undisturbed—
within, it aligns with the **Dao/Way**;
without, it conforms with **yì/rightness**.
Its words are few yet follow reason;
Its actions are pleasing yet accord with nature;
Its heart is harmonious yet unfeigned;
Its deeds are plain yet not ostentatious.
It does not plot beginnings,
nor debate endings.
At peace, it remains; when stirred, it acts.
Its body permeates heaven and earth,
its essence unites with Yin and Yang,
its harmony aligns with the four seasons,
its clarity shines like the sun and moon.
It follows the **Dao/Way**’s transformations—
this is the **true person**.

This is the **true person** who governs with **qīngjìng**,
aligning with heaven’s **Dao/Way** and harmonizing with the **Way**.
**Ren** is free from **jīqìao**—
deceit and artifice.

Thus, heaven covers with **virtue/power**,
earth bears with **yuè/music**,
the four seasons do not lose their order,
winds and rains do not act as disasters,
the sun and moon remain clear and radiant,
the five stars do not stray in their courses—
this is the clarity of **qīngjìng**.

The **true person**’s governance
responds to heaven and earth.
Thus, the sun and moon shine brightly yet do not force,
and calamities do not arise.

Laozi said:
The duties of governance in a **harmonious age** are easy to uphold,
its affairs are simple to execute,
its **ritual/lǐ** is straightforward to practice,
its rewards are clear to bestow.
Thus, one person does not hold multiple offices,
offices do not overlap with scholars,
scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants
keep to their own districts and states.

Thus, farmers speak with farmers of **cáng/hidden matters**,
scholars speak with scholars of conduct,
artisans speak with artisans of skill,
merchants speak with merchants of calculations—
so scholars lack no proper action,
artisans suffer no laborious toil,
farmers waste no effort,
merchants lose no goods,
each finding contentment in their nature.

Diverse forms and natures,
simple yet not contradictory,
lose their occupation and become despised,
gain their ambition and become honored.
The *Easy Words of the Yi* say:
**Qián** is easy to know,
**Kūn** is simple in ability.
The sage governs without action,
the people do not weary of their labors,
each finding contentment in their work,
all rejoicing in their lives.

Thus, governance is easy yet not chaotic,
the four classes gain their due—
this is honored;
lose their standing—
this is degraded.

Those with foresight and distant vision
are the most talented,
yet in a **harmonious age**, no blame is assigned to them.
No blame is placed upon them.
Those with vast knowledge and strong resolve,
eloquent and quick-witted,
are those whose understanding overflows,
yet the wise ruler does not demand from those below.
The clever and quick are not necessarily loyal and upright—
this is because the ruler does not seek from those beneath him.

To abandon the world’s coarse and despised,
not conforming to common customs,
is the conduct of scholars,
yet in a **harmonious age**, this is not how the people are transformed.»

The age of extravagance and neglect of customs cannot serve as a model.

Thus, those whose heights are unattainable should not be the measure for all;
those whose conduct is beyond imitation should not be the standard for the realm.

Therefore, talent cannot be monopolized or constrained by rigid measures,
while the Dao/Way and its methods may be passed down through generations.

These principles in a harmonious age—
scholars must discern their talents and employ them accordingly.
Only those who grasp the luminous Dao/Way and adapt with the times
can assist in governance.

Thus, when the realm is well-ordered, even the unlearned can uphold its ways,
and military formations can be standardized by law.

Without awaiting ancient sages, the people suffice in their own right—
utilizing what they possess and combining their strengths.

Governance lies in timely adaptation, not in seeking novelty;
eloquence should emphasize substance, not empty rhetoric or debate.

Yet if one measures ability and assigns positions appropriately,
there will never be a time without capable rulers.

Why wait for ancient worthies when the world is already well-ordered?

The laws of the declining age
set lofty standards yet fail to reach their mark,
impose heavy burdens yet cannot bear the punishment,
and create peril yet dare not execute.
The people, burdened by these three oppressions,
adorn their cunning to deceive the ruler,
pursue vice while courting danger—
though harsh laws and severe punishments are enforced,
they cannot suppress their deceit.

When beasts are cornered, they strike;
when birds are cornered, they peck;
when people are cornered, they deceive—
this is their nature.

To apply the law and punish only when crimes are committed
is to kill by law, not to govern.

Those filled with anxiety and fear
adorn their cunning, distort the truth, and scheme to gain advantage—
like birds and beasts driven to desperation,
their defiant hearts disregard their own lives.

Thus, the Sage values the Dao/Way over laws.

Laozi said:
*The thunder’s roar can be imitated by bells and drums;
the shifts of wind and rain can be understood through music’s tones.
What is vast and visible can be measured;
what is bright and apparent can be exhausted;
what is audible can be tuned;
what is discernible can be distinguished.

Yet the utmost vastness—heaven and earth cannot contain it;
the utmost subtlety—spirit and clarity cannot perceive it.

Wind, rain, thunder, and lightning—
their forms, sounds, colors, and symbols
can be categorized and applied to affairs.

But when it comes to the utmost vastness and subtlety—
this is the Dao/Way,
which heaven and earth cannot encompass,
which spirit and clarity cannot fathom.

When establishing laws and calendars,
distinguishing the five colors,
separating purity and turbidity,
discerning sweet and bitter tastes—
then the undifferentiated is dispersed into tools.

When establishing benevolence and righteousness,
refining rituals and music—
then virtue shifts into artifice.

The people adorn their cunning to astonish the ignorant,
employ deceit to attack their superiors—
though some may uphold these ways,
none can truly govern with them.

The more cleverness abounds, the more virtue declines—
thus, the perfect one remains pure and undivided.

The perfect one’s governance is
empty, silent, and tranquil—
seeing no desires,
the heart and spirit dwell in harmony,
the form and nature align,
stillness embodies virtue,
action flows with principle,
following the Dao/Way of nature
only when necessity arises.

Vague and effortless, yet the world harmonizes;
indifferent and desireless, yet the people return to simplicity.
Without contention, resources suffice.
The giver does not hoard,
the receiver does not refuse—
virtue returns naturally,
yet none can claim credit.

Speech without words,
the Dao/Way beyond explanation—
if one attains this,
it is called the Celestial Storehouse.

Take from it without depletion,
draw from it without exhaustion—
none know its source,
for the undifferentiated disperses and loses its origin.
Thus, the Sage acts and refines,
restoring them to their natural state,
concealing them in the Celestial Storehouse,
taking without diminishing,
giving without excess.

This is called *Yao Guang* [Shaking Brilliance].
*Yao Guang* is the resource for all things.
Its luminous radiance and luminous standard
are displayed within,
governing the ten thousand things of the four quarters,
commanding them as its provision.

Laozi said:
*Heaven cherishes its purity,
earth cherishes its levelness,
humans cherish their sincerity.
Heaven’s purity—
the sun, moon, stars, and constellations,
thunder and wind, rain and mist.
Earth’s levelness—
water, fire, metal, wood, and soil.
Human sincerity—
thought, perception, cleverness, joy, and anger.

Thus, closing the four gates,
halting the five pathways—
this aligns with the Dao/Way.

Spirit and clarity are hidden in the formless,
qi returns to its true essence.
The eyes see clearly yet do not gaze,
the ears hear keenly yet do not listen,
the mouth speaks appropriately yet does not speak,
the heart’s pathways are open yet do not deliberate.
Abandoning action, knowing without arrogance,
following nature’s essence,
one knows yet cannot be harmed.

When essence resides in the eyes, vision is clear;
when it resides in the ears, hearing is acute;
when it lingers in the mouth, speech is precise;
when gathered in the heart, thought is lucid.

Thus, closing the four gates
ensures a life free from calamity—
the limbs and orifices neither die nor live,
this is called the True Person.

Heaven’s four gates are the sun, moon, stars, and constellations.
The five pathways are the five phases.

Speaking of the four seasons having their due,
the five phases having their measure—
then heaven and earth are clear and bright,
and the people and creatures flourish.

Human four gates are the heart, mouth, ears, and eyes.
The five pathways are the five viscera.

When essence and spirit are preserved,
the four gates do not move recklessly;
the five pathways do not receive false stimuli—
vision is clear, hearing is acute,
speech and action are without fault—
thus, calamity and harm cannot reach the body,
and death does not dwell in the mind.
This is the domain where the True Person dwells in the Dao/Way.

Earth’s production of wealth
has no greater foundation than the five phases.
The Sage regulates the five phases,
and thus governance does not falter.

The Sage, by harmonizing the five emotions with the five phases,
prevents chaos in the world—
how much more so for ordinary people?

Laozi said:
*When balanced left and right,
there is no private preference for light or heavy,
thus it can serve as level.
When measured within and without,
there is no private bias for crooked or straight,
thus it can serve as upright.
When the ruler applies law,
there is no private favor or aversion,
thus it can serve as command.

Virtue has no fixed place,
grudges have no place to hide—
this is to entrust oneself to the Dao/Way
and align with human hearts.

These three principles—
relying on impartiality—
establish levelness,
preserve uprightness,
and enact command;

The Sage does not abandon virtue to the external world,
nor conceal grudges within.
To entrust oneself to the Dao/Way even unto death—
the common people remain unaware.

Thus, those who govern know not to interfere.

Water capsizes a boat, wood snaps an axle—
yet one does not blame the wood and stone,
but punishes the clumsy and the skilled.
This is not wisdom.

Water has no intent to capsize a boat,
wood no mind to snap an axle—
yet one blames the clumsy and the skilled,
for this is not the work of wisdom.

To govern a state with wisdom is to be its ruin.

Thus, when the Dao/Way is mixed with wisdom, there is chaos;
when virtue is mixed with intent, there is peril;
when the mind is mixed with perception, there is dizziness.
To cease wisdom is to avoid chaos,
to forget intent is to avoid peril,
to sever perception is to avoid dizziness—
all are acts of forgetting.

The scales and compasses, the square and the circle—
fixed and unchanging,
ever consistent and never crooked,
moving straight without hesitation.
Once shaped, they endure for ten thousand generations—
this is the Way of *wuwei* (non-action).

The scales are not unbalanced,
the plumb line not crooked—
yet those who wield them err.

The Dao/Way is not empty,
virtue not obscure—
yet those who cultivate it stray.

The One is *wuwei*—
used by a hundred kings,
transmitted for ten thousand generations,
yet never altered.

The One is *wuwei*—
used by a hundred kings,
transmitted for ten thousand generations without change.

All who act without emotion or private bias,
meeting the One in all things—
though they act all day,
never once do they act.

This Dao brings governance—
correct and unchanging.

Otherwise, how could the balance and measure
be crafted in a single day
yet never altered for ten thousand generations?

Laozi said:
*"The people say:
'A kingdom has a lost ruler,
an age has lost the Dao/Way.'

A person may reach exhaustion,
yet reason remains unblocked.
Thus, *wuwei* is the essence of the Dao/Way.

To grasp the essence of the Dao/Way
is to respond to the boundless.
Then why do kingdoms perish?
Because they lack the correct Dao/Way.

He who reaches exhaustion yet remains unblocked—
this is the Dao/Way.
To act without clinging—
this is virtue.
The essence of *wuwei* responds to the boundless.

Thus, if one does not follow the numbers of Dao/Way
and instead relies solely on one’s own ability,
exhaustion will come swiftly.

To pride oneself in one’s own virtue
while neglecting the Dao/Way—
ruin and humiliation will soon follow.

The sovereign need not leave his door
to know the world—
by observing things, he knows things;
by observing people, he knows people.

Thus, where strength is gathered, nothing is unconquerable;
where many minds unite, nothing is unachievable.

A thousand-strong force lacks no provisions,
a ten-thousand-strong host lacks no purpose.
Craftsmen have no conflicting skills,
scholars hold no dual offices—
each guards their duty,
none overstepping their bounds.
People find their proper place,
things find their natural rest—
thus tools are not despised,
duties not neglected.

By observing one thing, one knows the nature of another;
by measuring oneself, one discerns the nature of others.

He who skillfully uses the many
can divert rivers and fill seas;
he who skillfully uses people
can exhaust their hearts and strength.

Debt is light when few,
duties are easy when simple,
burdens are light when light—
thus the sovereign enforces minimal demands,
and the people perform with ease.
Hence, ruler and subjects endure without weariness.

This is the virtue of simplicity—
thus there is no labor or fatigue.

Laozi said:
*The Sage embodies the Great Unity.
The Great Unity takes emptiness and nothingness as its origin,
cleanness and stillness as its essence—
thus the Sage and king should embody it.

The king follows the patterns of yin and yang,
moving with measured rhythm.

The hegemon aligns with the four seasons,
never departing from their due.

The ruler applies the six *lü* (musical pitches),
harmonizing with all things in moderation.

To embody the Great Unity is to understand
the nature of Heaven and Earth,
to harmonize with the principles of virtue and the Dao/Way;
to shine with the clarity of sun and moon,
to resonate with the spirit of all things;
to move and rest in accord with yin and yang,
to rejoice and anger in harmony with the four seasons;
to cover all things with the Dao/Way,
spreading broadly without favor—
even the smallest creatures,
creeping or flying,
all depend on virtue to live.

Virtue extends beyond the realm,
and fame endures through the ages.
Thus, the ancient Sage-kings governed the world with the Dao/Way.

To follow yin and yang is to inherit
the harmony of Heaven and Earth,
to share brilliance with Heaven and Earth,
to shine with the radiance of sun and moon,
to resonate with the spirits of gods and ghosts;
to wear the round and tread the square,
to embrace the standard and sleep with the plumb line—
within, to govern the body;
without, to win the hearts of people.
When orders are issued, the world follows like the wind.

The Five Emperors governed the world with virtue.

To align with the four seasons is to
take and give in due measure,
to enter and exit with restraint—
joy and anger, firmness and gentleness,
never straying from principle.
Gentle yet unbreakable,
firm yet unfractured,
broad yet not licentious,
solemn yet not rebellious—
to nurture all things with ease and submission,
to abandon folly and embrace the unworthy,
without private favor.

The Three Kings governed the world with benevolence.

To apply the six *lü* is to
give life and take it,
to reward and punish,
to bestow and withhold—
this is the Dao/Way.
To subdue chaos and restrain violence,
to elevate the worthy and discard the unworthy,
to correct the crooked and establish the straight,
to clarify the paths of opening and closing,
to ride the times and leverage circumstances,
to serve and govern the hearts of people—
this is the way of the Five Hegemons governing with righteousness.

The Sage who does not embody yin and yang will be overrun;
the king who does not follow the four seasons will be diminished;
the hegemon who does not use the six *lü* will be humiliated;
the ruler who loses the plumb line and square will be deposed.

Thus, the small acting as the great
will reach exhaustion without intimacy;
the great acting as the small
will become narrow and unyielding.

In the age of the Sage-kings,
virtue and the Dao/Way had degrees of excellence;
in the age of the Five Hegemons,
benevolence and righteousness had varying depths.
Great and small could not transgress their bounds.

Laozi said:
*"Though a land be vast and its people numerous,
this is not true strength;
though armor be sturdy and weapons sharp,
this is not reliable victory;
though walls be high and moats deep,
this is not true defense;
though punishments be severe and laws harsh,
this is not true authority."*

The three cannot be relied upon—only the virtuous/powerful can rule.

For those who preserve governance, though small, they endure;
for those who abandon governance, though great, they perish.

Thus, the skilled in defense need no resistance—*yin* and *yang* suffice.
The skilled in war need no battle—
they ride the times and follow the people’s desires,
and all under Heaven submits.

Therefore, the skilled in governance accumulate virtue/power;
the skilled in wielding arms cultivate forbearance.
When virtue/power is accumulated, the people may be used;
when anger is restrained, authority may be established.

Where the *wen* (cultural refinement) extends deeply,
the *quan* (authoritative measures) command greatly;
where virtue/power is broadly applied,
the authority controls widely—
this is to strengthen oneself while weakening others.

The skilled in wielding arms first weaken the enemy, then engage—
thus, their expenditures are halved while their achievements are tenfold.

A thousand-chariot state practicing *wen* (cultural governance) rules;
a ten-thousand-chariot state fond of war perishes.

The victorious army wins first, then fights;
the defeated army fights first, then seeks victory—
this is ignorance of the Dao/Way.

Lightly wielding arms, though great, will perish;
skillfully employing governance, though small, will flourish.

Preserving the myriad households in the land of no death—this is victory;
driving the people into the land of corpses—this is certain defeat.

*[End of Volume Nine of the Treatise on the Mysterious and True]*
*[Volume Ten of the Treatise on the Mysterious and True, with annotations by Mo Xi Zi]*

The benevolent sovereign of **upper virtue** and the virtuous/powerful sovereign of **upper Dao** will have all under heaven flock to him;
the sovereign of **upper virtue** will have all within the seas come to him;
the sovereign of **upper righteousness** will have one state unite under him;
the sovereign of **upper propriety** will have one village follow him.
Without these four, the people will not flock to him.
From *"Upper Virtue"* onward, no chapter annotations are given—its meaning is similar.

The *Laozi* says:
The **Dao/Way** of the gentleman is to cultivate stillness to refine oneself,
to practice frugality to nourish life.
Stillness means not disturbing below—
if below is not disturbed, the people will not grumble;
if below is disturbed, governance will falter—
the people grumble when virtue/power is thin.
When governance falters, the wise do not offer counsel;
when virtue/power is thin, the brave do not fight.
The enlightened sovereign cultivates stillness to refine himself,
practices frugality to nourish life,
so that above there is no chaotic governance and below there are no grumbling people.
Then the wise offer counsel of their own accord,
and the brave fight for their own sake.
The chaotic sovereign is not thus:
In one day, he may possess the wealth of all under heaven,
command the power of one sovereign,
exhaust the people’s strength to gratify his senses,
while his ambitions fix on palaces and pavilions,
moats and ponds, gardens and enclosures,
tigers and rare beasts.
The poor suffer hunger and cold,
while the halls are decked in embroidered silks.
Thus, though the sovereign hoards these useless things,
the world does not rest beneath his rule.
This is the dark sovereign in his single day of power,
extorting the wealth of the world,
poisoning the four seas,
exhausting the people’s livelihoods,
indulging his eyes and ears in pleasure—
like the Second Emperor of Qin, whose use of power led only to folly.

The *Laozi* says:
Without simplicity, one cannot clarify virtue/power;
without tranquility, one cannot attain the distant;
without magnanimity, one cannot embrace and cover all;
without fairness, one cannot make decisive judgments.
To see with the eyes of all under heaven,
to hear with the ears of all under heaven,
to deliberate with the hearts of all under heaven,
to contend with the strength of all under heaven—
thus, his commands reach their full extent,
and the sentiments of his ministers ascend to his ears.
Officials diligently perform their duties,
while ministers gather like spokes to the hub.
He does not reward for joy,
nor punish for anger.
His laws are discerning yet not harsh;
his senses are keen yet not obscured.
The truth and falsehood of matters are laid bare before him daily,
and he does not resist them.
Thus, the wise exhaust their intelligence,
the unworthy strain their strength,
the near feel secure in their nature,
the distant cherish his virtue/power—
this is the **Dao/Way** of employing people.
Such is how the enlightened sovereign governs his state,
and how he employs his people—
like the Han’s Emperor Gaozu or the Tang’s Emperor Taizong.

He who rides in the imperial carriage and on fine horses
travels a thousand *li* without labor;
he who sails on ships and steers oars
crosses rivers and seas without swimming.
If one’s words are true, though he be a merchant or a humble laborer,
he should not be discarded;
if one’s words are false, though he be a sovereign, minister, or high official,
he should not be employed.
The judgment of truth and falsehood
cannot be decided by rank or status.
If one’s plans are useful, he need not be ashamed of his station;
if one’s words are practical, he need not be prized for his eloquence.
When employing people in accord with the **Dao/Way**,
one achieves results without effort,
and reaches understanding without action.
Thus, the Yellow Emperor was moved by the words of a shepherd boy
and brought order to all under heaven—
was he truly of low and weak status?
Hu Hai trusted the schemes of Zhao Gao
and lost all under heaven—
was Zhao Gao truly of noble rank?
The dark sovereign is not thus:
Few ministers offer sincere loyalty,
for he does not employ their talents.
He favors those close and familiar with deceit,
so the wise cannot be seen;
he spurns those distant, humble, and lowly,
so those who strain their strength and offer loyal counsel cannot be heard.
If one speaks, he exhausts them with words;
if one remonstrates, he executes them with charges.

「Thus yet seeking to bring peace to all under heaven,
to preserve the myriad lands,
his distance from wisdom and sagacity is already vast.

Without **saintly** virtue, one cannot still the four seas;
without **sagacity**, one cannot bring peace to the myriad lands.

**Laozi** said:
*"He who can honor life,
though rich and noble does not harm his body with sustenance,
though poor and humble does not burden his form with gain.
Though he spends ten thousand gold daily,
he does not indulge his mouth to harm life;
though his home lacks even a single grain,
he does not begrudgingly seek to injure **virtue/power**.
This may be called honoring life indeed.*

Now, receiving the hereditary noble rank of one’s ancestors,
one must surely place great weight on not losing it—
yet life’s origin has endured for ages,
and to lightly risk losing it, is this not perplexing?

To govern the world with noble rank is to entrust it with the world;
to govern the world with love is to rely upon it with the world.

Those who inherit the legacy of their ancestors yet lose it,
must surely do so through careless neglect.

Thus, if one does not blame oneself,
there is no way to entrust the world with oneself.

**Wenzzi** asked about the foundation of ruling a state,
and **Laozi** replied:
*"The foundation lies in governing oneself.
Never have I heard of a state in disorder while the self is governed,
nor has there ever been a state in order while the self is disordered.
Hence it is said:
Refine oneself, and one’s **virtue/power** shall be true.
If one’s self is not yet governed, how much less the state?"*

The **Dao/Way** is so supremely wondrous,
that a father cannot teach it to his son,
nor can a son receive it from his father.
Thus, the **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of is not the constant **Dao/Way**;
the name that can be named is not the constant name.
The constant **Dao/Way** has no name—
what can be named is not the **Dao/Way**.
Hence, what words and discourse cannot encompass,
fathers and sons cannot pass it on.

**Wenzzi** asked:
*"What conduct ensures the people love their ruler?"*
**Laozi** replied:
*"Lead them with proper timing,
and treat them with reverence and caution,
as though standing at the edge of a deep abyss,
or walking on thin ice.
Between heaven and earth,
the good become my nurtured subjects,
the unworthy become my **enemies**.
In ancient times, the ministers of Xia and Shang,
avenged the wrongs of Jie and Zhou
and served as subjects to Tang and Wu.
The people of Huosha,
attacked their own lord
and joined the followers of **Shennong**.*

Hence it is said:
*"What the people fear,
one must not fail to fear.
What is truly fearsome is not the ruler,
what is truly fearsome is not mere goodness."*

**Laozi** said:
*"To govern the great,
the **Dao/Way** cannot be trifling;
to rule vast lands,
the measures cannot be narrow;
to occupy high station,
the duties cannot be burdensome;
to lead many people,
the teachings cannot be harsh.
Burdensome duties are hard to govern,
harsh laws are hard to implement,
demands that are excessive are hard to satisfy.
Measure an inch with a ruler,
and by a yard it will surely be off;
weigh a **qian** with a balance,
and by a **dan** it will surely be excessive.
Yet weigh with a balance and measure with a ruler,
and even by a **dan** or a yard,
the errors will be few.
It is easy to be wise in broad strokes,
but subtle reasoning is hard to make sagacious.
The **Dao/Way** lies hidden in small things yet achieves greatness,
words lie hidden in simplicity yet reveal superficiality.
Thus, what does not benefit governance
but instead harms it,
the **saintly** does not practice;
what does not benefit utility
but instead wastes it,
the wise do not employ.

Hence, deeds are not to be scorned for being too restrained,
tasks are not to be scorned for being too few,
demands are not to be scorned for being too sparse.
Restrained deeds are easy to accomplish,
few tasks are easy to govern,
sparse demands are easy to satisfy,
and entrusting matters to the people makes it easy.
Thus, petty reasoning harms **righteousness**,
petty **righteousness** breaks the **Dao/Way**,
and the **Dao/Way** must be simple to be comprehensive.
The **saintly** are comprehensive in wisdom,
perceiving what has not yet come to pass,
not allowing small things to obscure the great,
nor burdensome matters to replace simplicity.

The river flows far because of its winding course,
not because it is a single ladle of water.
The mountain rises high because of its gradual ascent,
not because it is a single handful of soil.
The **Dao/Way** transforms because of its ease and flow,
not because of what is achieved in an instant.

He who excels in one skill,
is meticulous in one matter,
and discerning in one ability,
can employ clever arguments,
but cannot broadly apply them.

The tuner of music,
tightens the small strings,
and loosens the large ones;
the establisher of affairs,
makes the lowly labor,
and lets the noble rest.
Words say:
*"Balance the strings, fit the large and small—
in governing a state, noble and lowly alike must be justly treated."*

The words of the **Dao/Way** say:
*"Vague and indistinct,
align with heaven’s might,
and harmonize with heaven’s **qi**.
He who harmonizes with **qi** becomes **Emperor**,
he who harmonizes with **righteousness** becomes **King**,
he who harmonizes with deeds becomes **Hegemon**.
He who lacks all three perishes.
He who harmonizes with **qi** is without **virtue/power** yet is called so;
he who harmonizes with **righteousness** rescues the peril of the age;
he who harmonizes with deeds shares benefits with the people.
Without one of these three,
the peril of ruin is inevitable.
Hence, one does not speak yet is believed,
does not act yet is benevolent,
does not rage yet is awe-inspiring—
thus, the **heavenly heart** moves and transforms.

The Five **Emperors** acted naturally without effort,
harmonizing with heaven’s will.
All things received their life from them,
and responded in transformation.

To act yet be benevolent,
to speak yet be trustworthy,
to rage yet be awe-inspiring—
this is what is achieved through **sincerity** and **inner power**.

The Three **Kings**’ **sincerity** and **inner power** emanated from within,
responding outwardly in action,
yet still left traces,
not yet fully harmonized with the **heartless**.

To act yet lack benevolence,
to speak yet lack trustworthiness,
to rage yet lack awe—
this is what is achieved through mere outward appearance.

The Five **Hegemons**’ **sincerity** did not arise from the heart,
and thus nothing responded to them.
Hence, though they raged, they were not awe-inspiring.

Thus, with the **Dao/Way** to guide them,
even few laws suffice for governance;
without the **Dao/Way** to guide them,
even many laws suffice only for chaos.
Governance depends on the **Dao/Way** being essential,
chaos depends on laws being excessive.

**Laozi** said:
*"A whalefish out of water is controlled by ants;
a ruler who abandons his **Dao/Way**
and disputes matters with his ministers,
is controlled by his officials.
Fish cannot be out of water,
nor can a ruler abandon the **Dao/Way**.
To uphold one’s station with **non-action**,
those who guard their duties take refuge in obedience,
while ministers conceal their wisdom and do not act—
instead, they allow their superiors to monopolize affairs.
A ruler who does not entrust capable ministers
but prefers to act himself,
shall find his wisdom daily constrained
while he bears the blame alone.
If justice is exhausted below,
he cannot extend proper governance;
if his conduct falters in his station,
he cannot maintain authority.
If wisdom is insufficient for governance,
and awe is insufficient to enforce punishment,
then there is no way to interact with his subjects.

If joy and anger manifest in the heart,
and desires appear outwardly,
then those who guard their duties
shall abandon principle to curry favor,
and officials shall pervert the law to follow the wind.
If rewards do not match deeds,
and punishments do not fit crimes,
then ruler and subjects shall be at odds,
and sovereign and ministers shall harbor mutual resentment.»

The myriad officials grow chaotic, yet wisdom cannot disentangle them;
Praise does not arise, yet sagacity cannot illuminate it.
Not one’s own fault, yet he blames himself alone—
Then the sovereign’s labors increase, while ministers grow more negligent.

This is like the artisan who carves in place of the master.
He who carves in place of the master,
Rarely fails to harm his own hands.

When the sovereign entrusts the worthy and selects the capable,
And does not monopolize decisions for himself,
Then wisdom has its source, and sagacity need not always shine—
The guardians of duty shall not flatter above,
And the ministers shall uphold the law.
Yet still the innocent are slain,
And those with merit are not rewarded—
The sovereign’s labors increase, while ministers grow more negligent.

This is like the artisan who carves in place of the master,
And sits, harming his own hands.

To chase horses with their swiftness,
One’s sinews shall snap and fail to keep up—
To seize the reins from the chariot,
The horse shall die beneath the yoke.

The **Bólé** discerns them, the **Wángliáng** drives them,
A wise sovereign rides them—
Without the effort of discernment or driving,
Yet reaches a thousand *lǐ*—
This is the art of leveraging others’ strengths.

The sovereign, seated above, governs the multitude below;
His trust lies in loyalty and rectitude,
Not in outward form or inner spirit.
As with riding a horse,
He relies on the **shì** [discerning official] and the **yù** [driver],
Achieving a thousand *lǐ* without exertion—
This is no hardship.

The **Way** of the sovereign:
To act without attachment, to establish without preference.
To act is to debate,
To prefer is to flatter—
Debate invites usurpation,
Flattery invites corruption.
Corrupting his private inclinations,
Usurping his rightful governance—
He who submits to others’ control,
Cannot sustain the realm.

Thus, the master of governance does not pluck [at will];
This is because governance is formless.
Only those who embody **shénhuà** [transformation of the spirit],
No force can overcome.

The sovereign who governs,
Ever controls others—
Never controlled by others—
This is the master of governance who does not pluck [at will].
To use without visible form,
Hence the term **shénhuà**.

When inner desires do not manifest,
This is called **"jīng"** [restraining];
When outer evils do not enter,
This is called **"bì"** [closing].
To restrain within and close without,
What matter cannot be moderated?
To close without and restrain within,
What task cannot be accomplished?
To restrain within and close without,
There are no desires, no harms.

Thus, he does not act for them,
Nor does he act against them—
Yet they act for him,
And he acts through them.
Words that are not refuted,
Deeds that are not thwarted—
Following names to assess reality,
Letting each minister bear responsibility—
To regard ignorance as the **Way**,
To forbid cruelty as the sovereign’s principle—
Then the myriad officials’ affairs,
Each shall find their proper measure.

The sovereign preserves the grand framework,
Entrusts it to the myriad officials,
Examines their deliberations,
And determines their merits and faults—
That is all.

**Lǎozǐ** said:
*"The nourished are the people’s foundation;
The people are the realm’s base.
Thus the sovereign,
Above, follows the **Dao** of Heaven and its seasons,
Below, exhausts the logic of Earth,
Within, employs the strength of the people.
Hence the myriad creatures thrive—
Growth and abundance flourish.
Spring, he prunes the withered;
Summer, he harvests the fruits;
Autumn, he stores the vegetables and grains;
Winter, he gathers firewood and salt.
As the people’s resources,
They lack nothing in life,
And in death, no orphaned descendants mourn.
The corpse of the sovereign can preserve harmony,
Life and death are both in order."*

The **Way** of the ancient kings:
Does not net the multitude while seeking the **máo** [wild boar],
Nor flood the marshes while hunting fish.
Does not net the multitude while seeking the **máo** [wild boar],
Nor flood the marshes while hunting fish.
Does not exhaust the creatures.

The **yáo** [wolf] has not yet been sacrificed,
Yet the **zhì** [noose] resounds with empty sounds—
It cannot reach the wilds;
The **tǎ** [otter] has not yet been sacrificed,
Yet the nets do not enter the waters—
The **yīng** [eagle] and **sǔn** [hawk] have not yet struck,
Yet the snares are not spread upon the **gāo** [highlands];
The grasses and trees have not yet fallen,
Yet the axes and blades do not enter the forests—
The insects have not yet been roasted,
Nor the pregnant slain—
The **zhèn** [nest] is not yet explored,
The fish not yet grown to a *chǐ* [foot] in length are taken,
Nor the dogs and swine allowed to starve—
The year’s harvest is not yet ripe.

All follow their proper time,
And do not recklessly harm.

Thus, the myriad creatures’ births,
Like the **zhēng** [breath] of **yīn-yáng** [yin-yang],
Are said to rise when their **jīng-qì** [vital essence] is slain,
And their **dào** [proper measure] is taken—
Then the myriad creatures’ vital essence and **qì** surge upward,
Reaching the heavens,
And shall bring harm to mankind.

This is the **Way** of the ancient kings
To respond to the seasons in preparation,
To enrich the realm and benefit the people.

To nourish with propriety,
To take in due measure—
Not to disrupt their **Way**—
This is how the realm is enriched,
And the family preserved.

It is not a matter of what the eyes see
And the feet can reach—
If he desires to benefit the people,
And does not harbor resentment in his heart,
Then the people shall naturally provide.

To measure things by the heart,
To observe others by the body—
What need to raise brows or move feet,
Before all is complete?

**Lǎozǐ** said:
*"The ancient sovereigns,
When taking from below, had moderation;
When nourishing themselves, had restraint.
They calculated the year’s harvest,
Measured the people’s stored wealth,
Knew the surplus and the deficit—
Then they took and offered.
Thus they received what Heaven and Earth bestowed,
And avoided the perils of hunger and cold.
Their grief for the people was profound—
When the realm had famine,
Their food lacked savor;
When the people were cold,
Their winter cloaks were not fur-lined—
Sharing the people’s joys and sorrows,
Thus the world had no grieving subjects—
This was the ancient sovereign’s governance of the realm."*

The **dark sovereign** is not so.
When taking from the people,
He does not limit their strength;
When demanding from below,
He does not measure their stores—
Men and women cannot till and weave
To meet his endless demands.
Their labor is exhausted, their wealth depleted—
They have no dawn without dusk,
And sovereign and ministers alike grow weary.

Moreover, when a man plows,
One *zhǐ* [fathom] of grain does not benefit ten *mǔ* [mu] of land—
The yield of average fields,
Does not exceed four *dàn* [bushels].
His aged wife, children, and infirm dependents,
Rely on him for sustenance.
If calamity or disaster strikes,
They cannot meet the sovereign’s demands.
Then the sovereign pities them—
But the greedy tyrant,
Draining the people like a fisherman in drought,
To satisfy his insatiable desires—
Then the common folk do not enjoy Heaven’s harmony,
Nor walk upon Earth’s **virtue** [de].

This is the **dark sovereign’s** governance of the realm.

**Lǎozǐ** said:
*"The **qì** of Heaven and Earth,
None greater than **harmony**.
**Harmony** is the balance of **yīn-yáng** [yin-yang],
The division of day and night.
Thus, when spring arrives, all things are born,
When autumn comes, all things mature—
Birth and maturity must draw from **harmony’s** essence.
Hence, accumulated **yīn** does not give life,
Accumulated **yáng** does not transform—
Only when **yīn-yáng** intermingle,
Does **harmony** arise."*

This is the **harmony** of Heaven and Earth’s **qì**,
Thus all things attain birth and maturity.

Therefore, the **Dao** of the Sage
Is broad yet cautious,
Stern yet warm,
Soft yet upright,
Fierce yet benevolent.

Excessive rigidity breaks,
Excessive softness curls inward—
The **Dao** lies between **just** and **yielding**.

Like a measuring line,
It can be rolled and held,
Stretched and laid straight—
Long yet not sprawling,
Short yet not confined,
Straight yet not rigid—
Thus the Sage embodies it.

This is the Sage’s **harmony**.

Soft yet able to stand firm—
The carpenter’s square and compass.
Coiled yet able to unfold—
The Sage’s laws and measures.

Push benevolence too far, it becomes weakness—
Weakness lacks authority.
Push sternness too far, it becomes brutality—
Brutality lacks **harmony**.
Push love too far, it becomes indulgence—
Indulgence lacks order.
Push punishment too far, it becomes calamity—
Calamity breeds estrangement.
Thus, **harmony** is most valued.

**Lǎozǐ** said:
*"A realm endures by attaining the **Dao**;
It perishes by obstruction of principle.
Thus the Sage observes transformations to discern their omens.
**Virtue** waxes or wanes—
The winds first stir its signs.
Those who grasp the **Dao** of life,
Though small, shall grow great;
Those who bear signs of ruin,
Though established, shall fall.
A realm’s ruin does not lie in vastness;
The **Dao**’s practice cannot be slighted.
Thus survival lies in attaining the **Dao**,
Not in size;
Ruination lies in losing the **Dao**,
Not in grandeur.
Rulers of chaotic realms
Seek only broad lands,
Yet neglect **virtue** and **righteousness**;
Strive for high stations,
Yet neglect **Dao** and **moral power**.
They abandon what sustains them,
And court their own destruction.

The wise observe the wise and foolish
To judge the rise and fall of states—
**Virtue** and **moral power** endure,
Not in their scale, but in their depth.
If the sovereign above disrupts the **Three Lights**’ radiance,
And loses the people’s hearts below—
Who cannot fail to crumble?

Thus those who scrutinize themselves
Need not fear others.

In ancient times,
Deep practice was called **Dao** and **virtue**,
Shallow practice, **righteousness** and **benevolence**,
Thin practice, **rites** and **wisdom**.
These six are the state’s vital threads.
Deep practice brings thick blessings;
Shallow practice, thin blessings;
Full practice—all under Heaven submits.
In antiquity,
Cultivating **Dao** and **virtue** rectified all under Heaven,
Cultivating **righteousness** and **benevolence** rectified a realm,
Cultivating **rites** and **wisdom** rectified a village.
Thick **virtue** brings greatness,
Thin **virtue** brings smallness—
Thus the **Dao** does not rely on martial prowess,
Nor on strength or greed to prevail,
Nor on competition to gain.
To stand in all under Heaven is to push oneself outward,
To prevail is to let all under Heaven submit of its own accord,
To gain is to give to all under Heaven—
Not to seize for oneself.
Thus the yielding attains firmness,
The weak attain victory,
**Righteousness** and **benevolence** attain success,
The non-contentious cannot be contended with.
Thus the **Dao** in all under Heaven
Is like the great rivers and seas.

Heaven’s **Dao**:
Those who act against it perish,
Those who grasp it lose it.
To covet great fame while striving for it—
I see it as inevitable failure.
Yet even if grasped, it does not remain.
Great fame cannot be seized—
It is given by all under Heaven.
To give is to receive.
All under Heaven’s allegiance is to **virtue**.
Thus it is said:
The **virtue** of the highest **Dao** draws all under Heaven,
The **benevolence** of the highest **Dao** draws all within the seas,
The **righteousness** of the highest **Dao** draws a realm,
The **rites** of the highest **Dao** draw a village.
Without these four, the people will not submit.
If they do not submit, arms are used—
This is the perilous **Dao**.

Thus it is said:
*"Weapons are the most ominous tools.
Used only when unavoidable,
Victory brings no joy in slaughter.
Thus it is said:
In the land of death, thorns and brambles grow—
Mournful weeping fills the air,
Funeral rites mark the dwellings.
Therefore the **Junzi** prioritizes **Dao** and **virtue**,
And rarely resorts to arms.
Practice varies in depth,
**Virtue** in thickness—
**Dao** and **virtue** cannot be momentarily abandoned,
Warlike tools should not be recklessly wielded."*

**Wénzǐ** asked:
*"Why are **righteousness**, **benevolence**, and **rites** inferior to **Dao** and **virtue**?"*

**Lǎozǐ** said:
*"Those who practice **benevolence** must weigh it by sorrow and joy;
Those who practice **righteousness** must clarify giving and taking.
Within the Four Seas, sorrow and joy cannot reach all,
And exhausting the treasury’s wealth cannot suffice for the people.
Thus kindness cannot be universal.
Therefore, it is better to cultivate the **Dao** and practice **virtue**,
Aligning with Heaven and Earth’s nature—
All things then self-regulate,
And all under Heaven is nourished,
While **righteousness** and **benevolence** follow naturally.

Thus the **true man** dwells in the thick,
Not the thin.
Knowing the **Dao**’s **virtue** is profound while **righteousness** is shallow,
The Sage abides in the thick,
Not the thin.

**Rites** are the adornment of substance;
**Benevolence** is the manifestation of kindness.
Thus **rites** follow human nature without excess,
**Benevolence** does not overflow kindness—
Mourning the dead aligns with **benevolence**,
Funeral rites fulfill **rites**.
Nurturing life does not force what cannot be borne,
Nor sever what cannot be abandoned—
Measure and moderation never stray from balance,
And unearned praise finds no root.

Thus music suffices to unite joy,
Yet never strays from **harmony**,
Clarifying the division of life and death,
And the balance of extravagance and frugality.
When human nature loses **harmony**,
**Righteousness** and **benevolence** arise,
Regulated by **rites** and music,
Each made clear in their place without overstepping.

In the later ages, it is not so—
Words and deeds contradict,
Emotions and appearances clash,
**Rites** become burdensome adornments,
Music turns to licentious chaos,
Customs drown in worldly excess,
Praise and blame converge in court,
Thus the **true man** is abandoned and unused.

The later age is marked by:
Music’s licentiousness,
**Rites**’ corruption,
**Rites** becoming burdensome,
Emotions masked in pretense—
When the **true man** sees this,
He embraces simplicity,
Transforming customs.
If he races with the swift horse on foot,
Man cannot outpace the horse;
But mounted in a chariot,
The horse cannot outpace man."*

The **Dao/Way** is well-used when:

One rides upon the people’s strengths to achieve great deeds,
Leveraging what they can do to overcome what they cannot.

When the ruler gives them favorable timing,
The people repay him with wealth;
When the ruler treats them with **rites**,
The people repay him with death.

Thus, there are states in peril yet no secure ruler;
There are rulers in sorrow yet no contented ministers.

If **virtue/power** exceeds one’s station,
He is honored;
If **reward/luck** exceeds one’s **virtue/power**,
He is doomed.

**Virtue/power** is valued without limit,
**Righteousness** is sought without excess.
To hold **virtue/power** yet not be honored is to usurp one’s place;
To take **righteousness** yet not earn it is to steal wealth.

To be honored without **virtue/power** is doomed,
To take without **righteousness** is theft.

The **sage** finds contentment in poverty and joy in the **Dao/Way**,
Does not let desire harm life,
Does not let profit burden himself—
Thus he does not violate **righteousness** nor presumptuously seize what belongs to others.*

Without **virtue/power**, he is not honored;
Without ability, he is not appointed;
Without merit, he is not rewarded;
Without guilt, he is not punished.

In advancing men, he relies on **rites**;
In dismissing men, he relies on **righteousness**.

In the age of the petty man,
To advance him is like ascending to heaven;
To dismiss him is like descending into the abyss.
The **sage** in using men does not lightly advance nor easily dismiss;
The petty man fears advancement may not be lofty enough,
Regrets dismissal may not be deep enough.

To speak of the ancient is to criticize the present.
The present age is shallow and deceitful—
He loves those he wishes to live,
Hates those he wishes to die.

In judging horses, he errs by favoring the fat;
In selecting ministers, he errs by favoring the wealthy.
A plump pig fills the kitchen,
A gaunt one is heard in the temple.
Thus, the unworthy are appointed.

Though a horse be lean, if it is of fine breed,
It can still travel far;
Though a minister be poor, if he is loyal,
He can still accomplish great deeds.

The **noble man** discerns reality,
And does not trust slanderous words.
If a minister does not remonstrate when the ruler errs,
He is not a loyal servant;
If the ruler does not heed remonstrance,
He is not enlightened.

The one who does not remonstrate is called a **living corpse** (taking salary without duty),
The one who does not heed is a **tyrannical ruler**.

If the people sink in dissipation yet the ruler feels no concern,
He is not an **accomplished ruler**.
Thus, to uphold **rites** and die in hardship is the duty of a minister;
To endure cold and hunger is the kindness of a **benevolent father**.

If a ruler is thus, why fear the peril of the state?
If a minister is thus, why fear the lack of rank and reward?

To serve the great with the small is called **perverting** (changing nature);
To offend the great with the small is called **defying the Dao/Way**—
Though one may ascend to heaven beforehand,
He will surely plunge into the abyss thereafter.

Thus, in the village, elders are honored by seniority,
And the aged and destitute are never abandoned;
In court, rank determines precedence,
With distinctions between high and low.

Therefore, when the old and young uphold their proper **rites**,
Calamities have no cause to arise.

The exalted are honored because they are near the ruler;
The aged are revered because they are near kin;
The elders are respected because they are near brothers.
Thus, one honors the noble through the ruler,
Respects the aged through kinship,
And reveres the elder through **rites**.

Those born noble grow arrogant,
Those born rich grow extravagant.
Thus, few who are rich and noble,
Without the **Dao/Way** to reflect upon,
Can avoid wrongdoing.

Nobility without humility invites arrogance,
Wealth without restraint invites extravagance.
To dwell in nobility yet fail to uphold **virtue/power**,
And not commit wrongdoing—how rare!

To study without surfeit is the way to cultivate oneself;
To teach without weariness is the way to govern the people.
With wise mentors and virtuous friends,
Few would abandon **rites** and still not err.

To observe learning is to know the **Dao/Way**,
To receive instruction is to embrace all without distinction—
Entering a garden of orchids and immortals,
One must surely inhale their fragrant **qi**.

To recognize the worthy is **wisdom**,
To love the worthy is **benevolence**,
To honor **benevolence** is **righteousness**,
To revere the worthy is **rites**,
To delight in the worthy is **music**.

The ancients who governed the world well
Did nothing yet accomplished all—
Not creating affairs for the people,
Thus called **non-action**,
Yet following what benefits the people,
Thus nothing was left undone.

Therefore, governing the world requires **tolerance**—
To obtain this **tolerance** is to achieve **non-action** yet fulfill all;
To fail in this **tolerance** is to act and invite disaster.

The **tolerance** of governing the world is thus:
**Cautious**, as if crossing a great river in winter;
**Wary**, as if fearing injury from all sides;
**Dignified**, as if maintaining **rites**;
**Dissolved**, as if ice melting;
**Sincere**, as if uncarved wood;
**Mingled**, as if turbid water;
**Vast**, as if a valley.

This is the **tolerance** of governing the world.
**Tolerance** means encompassing all.

The **Dao/Way**’s appearance is thus:
The ruler governs with diligence, never slacking.

---
**Explanations of the above:**

**Cautious**, as if crossing a great river in winter—
Not daring to act rashly;

**Wary**, as if fearing injury from all sides—
Fearful of harm on every front;

**Dignified**, as if maintaining **rites**—
Humility, respect, and deference;

**Dissolved**, as if ice melting—
Not daring to hoard;

**Sincere**, as if uncarved wood—
Not daring to be artificially perfected;

**Mingled**, as if turbid water—
Not daring to seek clarity alone;

**Vast**, as if a valley—
Not daring to be full to overflowing.

To advance without daring to act,
To retreat without daring to lead—
To fear self-harm,
To cling to gentleness and not presume strength—
To humble oneself and honor others—
To diminish oneself and thus truly endure—
To be deficient and thus remain whole—
To endure filth and humiliation yet remain fresh—
To see insufficiency and thus not claim superiority.

The **Dao/Way** retreats yet leads,
Clings to weakness yet prevails,
Humbles itself yet rises above others,
Diminishes itself yet stands firm,
Lacks yet remains complete,
Endures filth yet remains pure,
Sees insufficiency yet is worthy.

The **Dao/Way** does nothing yet accomplishes all.

These are the inversions of the **Dao/Way**.
To place oneself last is to be first for others,
To diminish oneself is to gain from others.

Thus, the world reveres it without burden,
And the people willingly follow without exhaustion.

The **Dao/Way** of clarity—Laozi says:

All who study the **Dao/Way**,
If they can discern the distinction between Heaven and humanity,
And grasp the root of order and chaos,
If they purify the heart and clarify the mind to preserve it,
And observe its beginning and end,
Returning to the emptiness and stillness—
Then they may be said to have attained it.

Only those who embody purity,
And clearly return to emptiness and tranquility,
Can truly discern the distinction between Heaven and humanity,
And fathom the origins of all confusion.

The root of governance is **virtue/power** and righteousness;
Its branches are laws and statutes.
What gives birth to humanity is the root;
What does not is the branch.
Root and branch are one in essence,
Yet their dual nature is love and desire.

Prioritizing root over branch—this is the **君子** (junzi/noble one);
Prioritizing branch over root—this is the **小人** (xiao ren/commoner).

In the birth of humanity,
Spirit is the root,
Form is the branch.
Thus, in the **太上** (Great Sage) era, nurturing of spirit prevails,
And emotions and inclinations are regulated;
In the **末世** (Later Age), form is cherished,
And appetites and desires run wild.
Regulating desire clarifies the spirit,
Indulging desire harms the body.

When the spirit is clear and the body harmonious,
Root and branch mutually support,
Then one preserves the whole body and safeguards the spirit,
Without diminishing its true essence.
All methods of cultivation and discipline vary,
And inherent capacities differ—
Thus arise the distinctions between noble and common.

When laws arise,
They serve to aid **virtue/power** and righteousness;
If laws are exalted and **virtue/power** abandoned,
This is like valuing one’s cap and shoes
While neglecting one’s head and feet.

In governing a state,
One must first establish **virtue/power** and righteousness,
Then laws and decrees to bring order.
If laws and decrees are emphasized,
And **virtue/power** and righteousness neglected,
This is like neglecting one’s head and feet
While valuing one’s cap and shoes.

**Virtue/power** and righteousness are broad and profound.
To increase their height without broadening their foundation—this is ruin;
To extend their reach without deepening their root—this is destruction.

Thus, without great beams,
One cannot bear heavy burdens;
To bear burdens, none surpass **楝** (yuán, a strong tree);
To govern a state, none surpass **德** (virtue).

The ruler’s people are like the foundation of a city,
Or the roots of a tree.
Deep roots mean a firm foundation,
A thick base means a secure height.
Foundation and roots are like **德** (virtue) and the **Dao/Way**.

When a foundation is deep and broad,
Yet it is destroyed—this has never occurred.
When the **Dao/Way** is high and **德** (virtue) flourishes,
Yet the people do not revere it—this has never been heard.

Thus, what is not rooted in **德** (virtue) and the **Dao/Way**
Cannot be called a true principle;
What does not align with the ancient kings
Cannot be called the **Dao/Way**.

If one does not learn from antiquity,
And does not follow the **Dao/Way**,
Then it cannot be the law of the state.
To merely recite the methods of one deed or one merit,
This is not the universal **Dao/Way**.
To employ bizarre and deceptive techniques,
This is not the great **Dao/Way** of the world.

Laozi says:
The **Dao/Way** of governing people
Is like **造父** (Zào Fǔ, a legendary charioteer) guiding his four horses.
In the time of King **周穆王** (Zhōu Mù Wáng, King Mu of Zhou),
Zào Fǔ drove his horses.
With reins and bit in hand,
He aligned their movements with his own chest,
Gained their trust from within,
And harmonized their wills from without.
Thus he could take the **Dao/Way** and travel far,
With energy and strength to spare.
Advancing or retreating, turning or bending—
All went as he intended.
Truly, he mastered the technique!

Now, **权势** (authority and influence) are the ruler’s carriage;
Great ministers are the ruler’s four horses.
The body cannot abandon the carriage’s stability,
The hands cannot lose the horses’ hearts.
Thus, if the four horses are not attuned,
Zào Fǔ cannot guide them along the **Dao/Way**;
If ruler and ministers are not in harmony,
Even the **圣人** (sage) cannot govern with them.

To grasp the **Dao/Way** and guide with it—
Even mediocre talent can achieve this;
To clearly distinguish and demonstrate—
Even the wicked can be restrained.
Things come to completion while observing their changes,
Affairs unfold while responding to their transformations.
If the near are not disordered,
Then the far will naturally be governed.
Without employing contrived teachings,
Yet attaining the natural **Dao/Way**,
All actions will be without error.

With **造父**’s skill in guiding,
One need not fear the horses’ wild galloping;
With the **圣人**’s supreme governance,
One need not fear the people’s peril and ruin.

Laozi says:
All who practice the **Dao/Way**,
Must block the paths of evil and unseen forces,
And prevent what has not yet occurred.
They value not their own self-righteousness,
But rather their inability to act wrongly.
Thus it is said:
Do not allow what is desired to exist,
Or there will be no day without strife;
Do not allow what is to be taken to exist,
Or there will be no day without contention.
Thus, when desires are released,
The public **Dao/Way** prevails.

Those in excess are stopped by measure;
Those in deficiency are urged by use.
Thus, the world can be governed by one.

If one abandons official duties
And listens to praise and blame,
If one discards merit and labor
And relies on factions and cliques,
Then even with extraordinary talents,
One will not advance in office;
While the people’s customs decay in the state,
And ministers vie for power in court.

Thus, with the **Dao/Way** to guide people,
One is not guided by people;
Without the **Dao/Way**, one is constrained by people.
**舜** (Shùn, a virtuous ruler) as a commoner
Was revered by all under Heaven—
Because his **Dao/Way** endured,
And thus he could guide others.
**纣** (Zhòu, the tyrannical last king of Xia) as a ruler
Lost the loyalty of the four seas—
Because his **Dao/Way** perished,
And thus he was constrained by others.

Laozi says:
In governing a state, there are constants,
Yet benefiting the people is the root;
In governance and teaching, there is a **Dao/Way**,
Yet decrees and conduct follow antiquity.
If it benefits the people,
It need not strictly adhere to the old ways;
If it harmonizes with affairs,
It need not blindly follow custom.

Thus, the **圣人** adapts laws to the times,
And rituals to the customs.
Clothing and tools,
Each serve their purpose;
Laws and decrees,
Each suit their needs.
Thus, changing antiquity is not wrong,
Nor is following custom always commendable.

What is valued in governance
Is only fitting the times.
It is not a matter of frequent alteration.

Reading the books of ancient kings,
Is not as good as hearing their words;
Hearing their words,
Is not as good as understanding their intent.
To grasp their intent—
Their words cannot fully express it.

Thus, the **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of
Is not the constant **Dao/Way**;
The name that can be named
Is not the constant name.
To hold words as the **Dao/Way**,
Is to hold words while not possessing the **Dao/Way**;
To cling to stone as jade,
Is to cling to stone while not possessing jade.

Thus, the **Dao/Way** spoken of by the **圣人**
Is like metal and stone—
Once refined, it cannot be altered.
The principles of sound and rhythm
Are fixed and cannot be changed.
Governance is like the **琴瑟** (qin se, musical instruments);
When the melody ends, the tuning shifts.
Since the notes differ,
Thus it is fitting to change and adapt.
Laws, statutes, rituals, and music
Are the tools of governance,
Not the governance itself.

Thus, those who are skilled in technique
Cannot be consulted on the ultimate **Dao/Way**,
For they are bound by doctrine and awaken only to the common.

The ascent to Mount Langfeng is not within the reach of ordinary means,
Nor can those skilled in technique grasp the ultimate **Dao/Way**.

Laozi said: *"How few are the fixed laws under Heaven!*
When aligning with worldly affairs,
Attaining human principles,
Conforming to Heaven and Earth,
And scrutinizing spirits and gods,
Then governance may be rightly established.

To act conveniently in affairs,
To conform to humanity,
Is sufficient to govern the world.
Naturally harmonizing with the divine—
Why should there be fixed laws at all?

In ancient times, the Three Sovereigns ruled without decrees, yet the people obeyed;
The Five Emperors established decrees but had no punishments.
The Xia ruler did not break his word,
The Yin people took oaths,
The Zhou people made alliances.

The Three Sovereigns were Fu Xi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor.
The Five Emperors were Shaohao, Zhuantu, Gaoxin, Tang, and Yu.
The Three Kings were the Xia, Yu, Tang of Yin, and King Wen of Zhou.

In the distant past, without decrees the people obeyed;
In later times, harsh laws bred deceit.
Thus, *wuwei* transforms effortlessly,
While forced action governs with difficulty.
Oaths and alliances, once broken, invite punishment.

In the decadent age, men endure filth yet scorn humiliation,
Hoard gain yet lack shame.
Thus, laws and statutes are crafted according to customs,
Adjusting urgency and moderation.
Tools and implements adapt to the times,
Made suitable for their purpose.

Those bound by law cannot comprehend comprehensive governance;
Those constrained by ritual cannot respond to change.
Only those with singular insight and acute hearing
Can then wield the **Dao/Way** and act accordingly.

Those bound by law and text move stiffly and stagnant;
Those with singular perception and hearing
Do not stray from the **Dao/Way**.

To know the origin of laws is to adapt with the times;
To ignore the source of governance, though obedient, leads only to chaos.

Now, scholars cling to tradition,
Grasp texts and hold fast to doctrine,
Hoping to govern thereby—
As if without this, governance is impossible—
Like forcing a square peg into a round hole,
Seeking suitability is difficult indeed.

To cling to law and text without flexibility,
Believing oneself to govern,
Is like forcing a square into a circle—
How could it ever fit?

To preserve danger and govern chaos,
Requires wisdom beyond the ordinary,
Yet the **Dao/Way** precedes antiquity—
Even the foolish may grasp it.

Thus, laws untested the **圣人** does not employ;
Words unverified the wise ruler does not heed.
If matters demand it, even the foolish must act;
If principles conflict, even the virtuous must abandon them.

Wenzi asked: *"Where do laws derive their authority?"*
Laozi replied: *"Laws arise from righteousness,
Righteousness from what benefits the many.
When benefits align with the people’s heart,
This is the essence of governance.

Laws do not descend from Heaven,
Nor emerge from Earth—
They arise from humanity,
Returning to self to be rectified.
If one attains their root,
Disorder is averted before it begins.
Knowing the essentials,
One is not confounded by doubt;
If it exists within oneself,
One does not criticize others;
If it does not exist within oneself,
One does not blame those who establish it.

Those below must not neglect what is above;
What is forbidden to the people must not be practiced by the ruler.
Thus, when the ruler establishes laws,
First, they must govern themselves.

If restraint begins with the self,
Then the people will be restrained.
The county’s laws—
Laws that are not laws—
Are laws that govern the laws.
Once laws are established,
Those who conform are rewarded,
Those who deviate are punished—
Even the noble must not lightly receive reward,
Even the lowly must not suffer excessive punishment.

Those who violate the law,
Though virtuous, must be punished;
Those who conform,
Though unworthy, are guiltless.
Thus, public virtue prevails while private desires are checked.

In ancient times, officials were appointed
To restrain the people,
So they might not act wantonly;
The ruler was established
To restrain officials,
So they might not act unilaterally.
Laws and the **Dao/Way** restrain the ruler,
So he may not act arbitrarily.

When none act wantonly,
Then the **Dao/Way** prevails and principles are fulfilled.
Thus, return to simplicity and *wuwei*.

*Wuwei* does not mean inaction—
It means action arising from the self.

Establish rulers with officials,
So the sovereign does not act wantonly,
And the people do not act unilaterally.
Thus, the sovereign upholds proper conduct,
And the people do not pervert the law.
How difficult is it to govern the world?

Laozi said:
*The skilled in rewards spend little yet inspire many;
The skilled in punishments reduce crime while deterring vice;
The skilled in encouraging virtue use minimal means yet cultivate **德** (virtue/power);
The skilled in taking resources gather much yet breed no resentment.

Thus, the **圣人** follows what the people naturally favor to encourage virtue,
And what they naturally abhor to restrain vice.
Reward one, and the world rushes to emulate;
Punish one, and the world fears to transgress.
Thus, the greatest rewards cost nothing,
And the greatest punishments are never excessive.
The **圣人** governs with brevity yet achieves vast results—
This is what is meant.

This is how the **圣人** fulfills governance.

Laozi said:
*The **臣道** (subject’s path) is to speak truthfully when appropriate,
To lead in action,
To uphold duty and clarify distinctions,
Thus achieving success.

Thus, when ruler and subject follow distinct paths, governance is established;
When they share the same path, chaos ensues.
Each attaining their proper place,
Acting appropriately,
Then above and below can govern one another.

Thus, branches must not exceed the trunk,
Nor ends surpass the root—
Speech and action must balance in weight and measure.
When ruler and subject are clearly distinguished,
Then great and small do not overstep.

Those who wield authority hold little yet command much,
Stand in a small place yet influence broadly,
Adhere strictly to principle yet govern extensively.
A tree ten *zhang* in girth supports a thousand-*jin* house—
This is the power of leverage.
A five-*cun* hinge controls the opening and closing—
This is the power of position.

What the people must obey today,
Those who conform prosper,
Those who resist perish—
None dare disobey—
This is the power of conformity.

Issuing decrees and enforcing prohibitions
Relies on the multitude for authority.

Righteousness is not about exhausting the world’s benefits for the people—
It is about benefiting one, and the world follows."

The tyrant does not exhaust harm upon the realm—
He harms one, and the world rebels.
Thus, every action and decision must be weighed with care.

Be cautious in your actions and affections,
Grant rewards without partiality,
Inflict punishments without bias.

As Laozi says:
*"Bend an inch to straighten a foot,
A small crookedness yields great rectitude—
The sage acts thus."*

Yet rulers today judge their ministers
Not by their grand achievements or broad conduct,
But by trifling virtues—
Thus losing the way to true merit.

Thus, when a man has great virtue,
His minor flaws are overlooked;
When a man has great renown,
His small faults are forgotten.

Human nature is never without flaw—
What matters is his grand purpose.
Though he has small errors,
They should not be held against him.

If his grand purpose fails,
His common virtues are insignificant.
To speak of a man’s talents as flawless is folly—
One must not doubt his minor faults
But uphold his great use.

Common virtues and slanderous words
Are not to be trusted.
Thus, the overly meticulous fail in great success,
While those who scorn conduct are shunned by the multitude.

The grand in stature has loose restraints,
The vast in measure earns distant praise—
This is the way to judge ministers.

If one judges ministers thus,
He will not lose the right man.

As Laozi says:
*"From ancient times to now,
No one has ever been flawless in conduct."*

Thus, the noble does not demand perfection of one man.
No man is fully capable—
Measure his talents and assign him accordingly.

Square yet not rigid,
Sharp yet not jagged,
Straight yet not reckless,
Broad yet not vulgar—
In virtue, culture, and martial prowess,
Do not demand perfection of others.

Cultivate oneself with the Dao,
And do not demand of others—
This is easy to reward.

Cultivate oneself with the Dao,
And there will be no regrets.

To cultivate oneself without demanding of others,
Yet act in the world—
Is this not possible?

The jade of the Xia sovereigns cannot be without blemish,
The moon’s pearl cannot be without impurity—
Yet the world treasures them,
Not letting minor flaws obscure their great beauty.

Now, if one fixates on another’s shortcomings
And forgets their strengths,
Yet seeks merit in the world—
This is difficult indeed.

The jade of the Xia sovereigns and the moon’s pearl
Still have flaws—
How can the worthy and noble be entirely flawless?

Abandon their flaws,
Take their strengths—
Then no talent will be wasted.

The common view sees only
Lowly station, humble birth,
Humiliating tasks—
Yet fails to grasp their grand purpose.

Most men despise what is lowly and shameful;
The noble judges men by their grand purpose.

Thus, the way to judge a man:
When he rises, observe his actions—
This reveals his talent.
When he is wealthy, observe his generosity—
This reveals his virtue in aiding others.
When he is impoverished, observe his principles—
He does not act against righteousness.
When he is lowly, observe his conduct—
He does not dwell where the Dao is absent.
Observe his response to calamity—
This reveals his courage.
In adversity, true benevolence and bravery are seen.
When he rejoices, observe his restraint—
He does not overstep.
When entrusted with wealth, observe his benevolence—
He does not take what is not his.
When threatened, observe his resolve—
He would sacrifice himself for righteousness.

Thus, one may discern human nature.

If one aspect is present, he is capable;
If all seven are complete, he is a hero of the age.
By this, the worthy and foolish may be known,
And loyalty and sincerity revealed.

As Laozi says:
*"To bend is to seek straightening,
To be crooked is to seek rectitude.
Bend an inch to straighten a foot,
A small crookedness yields great rectitude—
The noble acts thus."*

All rivers flow toward the sea—
Those that do not are not valleys.
Men pursue different paths—
Those who do not return to the good are not noble.

Noble speech must be practicable,
Noble action must be rooted in benevolence and righteousness.

The noble’s errors,
Like eclipses of the sun and moon,
Do not obscure their brilliance.
Errors are seen by all,
But when corrected, all revere them.

Thus, the wise do not act recklessly,
The brave do not kill recklessly—
Choose what must be done,
Act according to ritual propriety,
So that deeds are accomplished and merit is assured,
And though death comes, his name endures.

Do what must be done,
Kill what must be killed—
Then success is achieved and name is established,
Praised by future generations.

Though one may be intelligent,
He must ground himself in benevolence and righteousness
Before he stands firm.

Intelligence and ability must align—
The sage uses benevolence and righteousness as his measure.
Those who meet the measure are noble;
Those who do not are petty.

Though the noble may die,
His name does not perish;
Though the petty may gain power,
Their guilt is not erased.

Thus, Yao and Shun did good,
And the worthy praised them;
Jie and Zhou did evil,
And their names were not established.

The names of good and evil endure—
Thus, the noble is cautious in avoiding evil deeds.

To hold the map of the world in one hand
And slit one’s own throat with the other—
Even the foolish would not do this,
For life is precious above all.

To be a guest of the "Lone Sovereign" at dawn
And a corpse cast aside by dusk—
These are the actions of the foolish and petty,
Not the conduct of the noble.

To die for one’s lord and parents is to return home—
Righteousness is heavier than life itself.

Thus, the greatest benefit in the world,
Compared to the self, is small;
The self, compared to righteousness, is light.

This is to take benevolence and righteousness as the measure.

Is this not a lament for the times lacking in benevolence and righteousness?

Thus, it is fitting to speak of the noble dying for righteousness,
And the petty dying for gain.

As Laozi says:
*"The completeness of virtue and the Dao
Is like the sun and moon—
Even barbarians cannot alter their course.
If one has the Dao,
Even in barbarian lands, it will prevail.
Without the Dao,
What use is the Central States?"*

If aspirations and actions align,
Then praise or blame depends on custom;
If intentions and conduct are balanced,
Then poverty or prosperity depends on fate.

If one’s deeds are complete in the world,
Then success is achieved;
If one’s efforts accord with the times,
Then name is established.

Thus, those who establish merit and name
Are simple in the world yet cautious in the times.
When the time arrives,
Even a breath’s delay is too late.

The **Dao/Way** of rescuing the fallen and the weak while establishing merit and name
Must seize its opportunity—no time for hesitation, not even a breath.

The ancient warriors who wielded arms
Did not covet land or treasure—
They sought to preserve life and quell disorder,
To remove harm from the people.

Men greedy for wealth and pleasure,
Devouring the world’s resources,
Disturb the masses—
None can rest in their homes.

When a **sage** arises in fury,
Punishing the strong and violent,
Restoring order to the chaotic age,
Removing the world’s calamities,
Turning turbidity into clarity,
Transforming peril into peace—
Then they must be cut down.

The **Red Sovereign** became a fire disaster,
So the **Yellow Sovereign** subdued him.
**Gonggong** brought water ruin,
So **Zhuanxu** slew him.

These two **sages** who rose in wrath
Did not seek to exalt their power,
To profit from the land,
To hoard wealth,
Or to spare the wicked—
They removed the world’s cruel afflictions,
Acting only when forced.

Teach the people with the **Dao/Way**,
Guide them with **virtue/power (de)**,
Yet if they do not heed,
Then confront them with martial might.
If they still refuse,
Then suppress them with arms.

To slaughter the innocent,
To sustain the unrighteous—
No greater harm exists.
To amass the world’s wealth,
To satisfy one man’s desires—
No deeper misfortune could be.

To indulge one man’s desires,
Yet prolong the nation’s suffering—
This is what **Heaven’s order (天伦)**** rejects.

When **Heaven** destroys them,
**Jie** and **Zhou** are the examples.

The purpose of establishing rulers
Is to restrain violence and chaos.
Yet now, they exploit the people’s strength,
Only to become the very wickedness—
So, even with wings attached,
How can they claim to be unchecked?

The man who breeds fish
Must remove the **bats (蝙蝠)** and **otters (獭)**,
The man who tends birds and beasts
Must eliminate the **wolves (豺)** and **wild dogs (狼)**.
How much more so the shepherd of the people?

Thus, the reason arms are raised.

No **Dao/Way** is greater than punishing the violent,
No **virtue/power (de)** surpasses calming the people.

When rulers are cruel and without the **Dao/Way**,
The masses are restless.
If they are not removed,
It is like letting ferocious beasts harm humanity,
Or raising fish and turtles to feed the **bats** and **otters**—
No greater crime exists.

Laozi said:
*"The **Dao/Way** of governing a state
Is to have no harsh decrees above,
No burdensome administration in office,
No deceptive conduct among the scholars,
No excessive craftsmanship among the artisans.

Their tasks are fulfilled without disturbance,
Their tools are complete without ornamentation—
This is the age of perfect governance."*

In times of disorder, it is not so.
Those who pursue **achievement (行)**,
Compete to exalt themselves in falsehood;
Those who uphold **ritual (礼)**,
Vainly display their hypocrisy.

Chariots and carriages are over-carved,
Utensils are excessively filigreed.
Seekers of wealth vie for scarce treasures,
Calling them precious;
Those who follow **music (音)**,
Chase after frivolous complications,
Claiming them urgent.

Debates become deceitful,
Cases drag on endlessly—
No benefit to governance,
Only harm to order—
This is the logic of a declining age.

Artisans craft bizarre tools,
Taking years to complete,
Yet they fail to meet practical needs.

Thus, **Shennong’s law** states:
*"If men of prime vigor do not till the fields,
The world will have those who suffer hunger;
If women of their years do not weave,
The world will have those who endure cold."*

Therefore, the **sage** plows in person,
His wife weaves by hand,
Setting an example for all.

In guiding the people,
The **Son of Heaven** plows the fields to encourage farming,
The **Empress** personally spins to inspire weaving—
How much more so the common folk,
Who grow slack in tilling and weaving,
Yet suffer from hunger and cold?

Precious things are not valued for their scarcity,
Useless objects are not prized for their weight.
Thus, the plowman does not strain,
For there is no way to sustain life;
The weaver does not exert herself fully,
For there is no way to clothe the body.

With neither surplus nor lack,
Each returns to their own needs.
When food and clothing are abundant,
Wickedness does not arise.
In peace and ease,
No calamity occurs—
The world is harmonious.

The wise have no schemes to employ,
The brave have no strength to display.
The wise act to avert danger,
The brave act to suppress violence.
When danger and violence cease,
What need is there for them?

Laozi said:
*"The **Dao/Way** of the **Conqueror** and **King**
Is to plan with strategy,
To scheme with foresight.
To act under the banner of righteousness—
Not to preserve his own state,
But to save the doomed.

He who saves the doomed—
Thus, when hearing of a ruler from another state
Who oppresses his people,
He raises his army and marches to their borders,
Accusing them of unrighteousness,
Exposing their misdeeds.

At the enemy’s outskirts,
He commands his generals:
'Do not cut down trees,
Do not dig up graves,
Do not destroy crops,
Do not burn stores,
Do not capture the people,
Do not seize livestock.'

Then he proclaims:
'That ruler
Defies **Heaven and Earth**,
Insults **spirits and gods**,
Judges cases unjustly,
Slaughters the innocent—
**Heaven** condemns him,
The people seek vengeance.

The army comes
To abolish unrighteousness
And enthrone the virtuous.

If any dare defy **Heaven’s order**,
Disturb the people—
Death to themselves,
Extinction of their kin.
If they heed the call as a family,
Reward the family;
If they heed as a neighborhood,
Reward the neighborhood;
If they heed as a village,
Reward the village;
If they heed as a county,
Reward the county.

Conquer the state,
Yet spare its people;
Depose the ruler,
Yet reform his governance;
Honor the talented,
Display the virtuous;
Support the orphaned and widowed,
Relieve the poor;
Free the imprisoned,
Reward the meritorious.

The common folk open their doors to welcome them,
Offer grain to store for them—
Only fearing they will not come.

A **righteous army**, arriving at the border,
Stops without battle.

Where a **righteous army** passes,
**Heaven and Earth** are made aware;
The **spirits and gods** are informed,
**Virtue/power (de)** extends to all things.
They address the multitudes with words of peace,
They question the enemy with charges of guilt—
Yet they do not easily wield weapons of slaughter.

The people rejoice and submit,
Only fearing they will not arrive.

**Yin Tang** and **Wen Wu**
Punished violence with **righteousness**.

An **unrighteous army**
Arrives amid corpses and rivers of blood,
Facing enemies in relentless combat.
Thus, those who fight for land
Cannot achieve kingship;
Those who fight for themselves
Cannot establish merit.

If one raises arms for others,
The multitude will aid them;
If one raises arms for themselves,
The multitude will abandon them.

Where the multitude is moved,
Even the weak will grow strong;
Where the multitude departs,
Even the great will perish.

「The unrighteous army, with its strength, dredges the weak,
relying on its greatness to encroach upon the small,
slaughters the innocent, and harms the virtuous.
Though it may butcher ten thousand in a city,
plunder lands a thousand leagues wide,
its fate shall be like that of Xiang Yu—
whose **Way (Dao)** dominated the seas and lands,
whose **qi** swallowed the cosmos,
whose might towered over hills and valleys—
yet was ultimately crushed by Gaozu.
This is because he did not follow the **Way (Dao)** and righteousness;
though great, he must fall;
though strong, he must perish.
Even the ambition for tyranny could not be fulfilled—
how much less could he achieve kingship?

**Laozi** said:
*"The highest **virtue/power (de)** in governance*
is to rule the state,
order the realm,
practice benevolence and righteousness,
bestow virtue and kindness,
establish just laws,
and block unrighteous paths.
Then the ministers will be loyal and attached,
the people will be harmonious and unified,
and the ruler and subjects will share a single heart,
their ministers working in concert.
The feudal lords will submit to his authority,
and the four quarters will embrace his **virtue/power (de)**.
He will rectify the halls of power,
and vanquish his enemies a thousand leagues away.
When he issues commands,
the world responds in unison—
this is the highest form of governance.

When a state is vast and its people numerous,
its ruler wise and its generals capable,
its wealth abundant and its armies strong,
its laws trusted and its orders clear,
and its enemies balanced in strength,
then even without battle or blade,
the foe will flee in disarray—
this is the second form of governance.

To know the suitability of the land,
to master the advantages of rugged passes,
to discern the flaws of oppressive rule,
and to study the movements of armies.
When blades clash and arrows fly,
to bear the dead and tend the wounded,
to see rivers of blood and corpses strewn across the fields—
this is the lowest form of governance.

To govern through **virtue/power (de)** is the highest;
to govern through law is the middle;
to govern through force is the lowest.

The victory or defeat of armies
lies in governance.
When governance overcomes the people,
the lower ranks submit to the upper—
then the army is strong.
When the people overcome governance,
the lower ranks rebel against the upper—
then the army is weak.

If **righteousness** is sufficient to embrace the people of the world,
if undertakings are sufficient to meet the world’s crises,
if appointments are sufficient to win the hearts of the worthy,
and if deliberations are sufficient to weigh the light and heavy—
then this is the **Way (Dao)** of the highest **virtue/power (de)**.

**Laozi** said:
*"The reason a state is strong*
is because of its resolve to die.
The reason it resolves to die*
is because of **righteousness**.
The reason **righteousness** prevails*
is because of its **威 (威)** [awe/authority].
Thus, to govern with words of **virtue/power (de)**,
and to unify with the might of **威 (威)** [awe/authority]—
this is called inevitable victory.
When **威 (威)** and **righteousness** are both wielded—
this is called inevitable strength.

When blades clash and stones rain down,
yet soldiers vie to strike first—
this is because rewards are trusted and punishments are clear.
If a ruler regards his subjects as his children,
his subjects will serve him as their father;
if a ruler regards his subjects as his younger brothers,
his subjects will serve him as their elder brothers.
If a ruler regards his subjects as his children,
he will surely reign over the four seas;
if his subjects serve him as their father,
he will surely govern the world.
If a ruler regards his subjects as his younger brothers,
then he will surely die for them;
if his subjects serve him as their elder brothers,
then he will surely perish for them.
Thus, when a ruler’s enemies are his own father, son, or brothers,
he cannot fight them.
If a ruler is thus,
then the world is like one family.
Ten thousand armies united in heart,
then even enemies are not feared,
and death is not shunned.
When **恩 (恩)** [favor] and **义 (义)** [righteousness] are felt,
men will regard death as returning home.
Who would see their father in peril
and grudge their own life to save him?
Who would see their ruler in danger
and fear death rather than remain loyal?

Thus, a **righteous ruler** refines his governance within,
to accumulate his **virtue/power (de)**;
and blocks the unrighteous without,
to display his **威 (威)** [awe/authority].
He observes their labor and ease,
to know their hunger and fullness.
When war is decided upon,
he treats death as returning home—
this is the favor bestowed upon them.
When **信 (信)** [trustworthiness] and **义 (义)** [righteousness] are established,
even death is not shunned.
When **恩 (恩)** [favor] and **威 (威)** [awe/authority] are both wielded,
no distance is beyond their reach.

Thus concludes the eleventh volume of the *通玄真经 (Tongxuan Zhenjing)* [The Authentic Scripture of the Perfected Way].」

The Authentic Scripture of the Perfected Way, Volume Twelve
*Commentary by Mo Xi Zi*, Part One: *On Rites*

Laozi said:

In the ancient age, the True Person was the sovereign of the Mysterious Old Dao.
Through his breathing, he harmonized the yin and yang,
and all things born under heaven naturally revered his **virtue/power (de)** for its gentleness and compliance.
At that time, **领理 (lingli)** [natural governance] and **隐密 (yinmi)** [subtle mystery] were spontaneously formed,
and the pure, unrefined essence remained undispersed,
while all things flourished in great ease.
Within, he concealed his bright **德 (virtue)**, without, he harmonized all things,
and the world knew no strife—
each followed its nature, without mutual harm,
thus all lived in perfect ease.

When the age declined to the time of **伏羲 (Fu Xi)**,
the people, dimly enlightened, all sought to abandon their childlike hearts
and awaken to the Dao of heaven and earth.
Their **virtue/power (de)** became complex and inconsistent.
Then the Eight Trigrams were first drawn,
to connect with the divine and to categorize all emotions.
Knotted ropes were made as nets and snares,
to hunt and fish.
The sovereign of the world, having abandoned childlike simplicity,
gradually lost his original Dao—
his **virtue/power (de)** became complex and inconsistent,
compared to the Mysterious Old time, making it an age of decline.

When **神农 (Shennong)** and **黄帝 (Huangdi)** took leadership of the world,
they regulated the four seasons,
harmonized the yin and yang,
and thus all the people refined their bodies and minds,
listened and observed with reverence—
yet governance remained harsh, not harmonious.

**伏羲 (Fu Xi)** created the **未耜 (weiji)** [plowshare],
to teach the people how to sow seeds;
**黄帝 (Huangdi)** invented the **轩冕 (xuānmìan)** [ceremonial robes],
and **窍领 (qiàolǐng)** [to regulate with subtle governance],
meaning to open the blocked and to harmonize the yin and yang,
to stop the rebellious **气 (qi)** and to cease the harming of things.
He established writing and contracts,
established laws and calendars,
regulated the four seasons,
harmonized the Five Phases,
fearing the loss of their essence—
he made all things refine their bodies,
and all focused their ears and eyes,
listening and observing to **德化 (dehua)** [virtuous transformation],
to uphold their sovereign.
Thus, he spoke of governance being unharmonious.

In the ages of **夏 (Xia)** and **殷 (Yin)**,
their desires extended to all things,
their cleverness was enticed by the external world,
and their true nature was lost.
When desires for things arose in **夏 (Xia)** and **殷 (Yin)**,
they were enticed by the external world;
when cleverness was indulged,
their true nature was lost within.
This spread to the **周室 (Zhou Dynasty)**,
where **浇 (Jiao)** and **醇 (chún)** [debauched and refined] diluted the pure,
abandoned the Dao for falsehood,
took **险 (xian)** [deceitful] **德 (virtue)** as conduct,
and gave rise to cleverness and cunning.
They schemed to imitate the sages,
adorned falsehood to please the crowd,
polished poetry and scriptures
to purchase fame and reputation.
Each sought to display their cleverness,
to use falsehood to fit into the world,
and thus lost the true essence of the great Dao.
Hence, the world has long been losing its true nature,
and the decline has been gradual for ages.

By the time of the **周室 (Zhou Dynasty)**,
**Dao/Way (Dao)** and **virtue/power (de)** were completely lost.
**浇 (Jiao)** [debauched] and **酿 (niàng)** [refined] grew even more extreme,
taking falsehood and deceit as the Dao,
taking cleverness and cunning as **贤 (xian)** [virtuous excellence],
displaying the Dao and boasting of **德 (virtue)**,
purchasing fame and seeking reputation—
thus losing the true essence of the great Dao.
The decline of the age began from **Fu Xi (伏羲)** and **Xuānmìan (轩冕)**,
counting thousands of years—
thus it is said that the decline has been long,
not that it suddenly began in the **周室 (Zhou Dynasty)**.

Therefore, the study of the **至人 (zhiren)** [perfected/sage] is to return to the **无 (wu)** [non-being/emptiness] of true nature,
and to wander the mind in the **虚 (xu)** [void].
The study of the common world, however,
is to **擢德 (zhuóde)** [flaunt virtue] and **攓性 (nièxìng)** [constrain nature],
to torment the five **藏 (zang)** [organs],
to act rashly beyond wisdom,
and thus to **譊 (yǒu)** [create discord] with their cleverness and cunning.
They clamor and shout for fame in the world—
this is what the perfected do not do.
**擢德 (zhuóde)** [flaunting virtue] is self-promotion,
**攓性 (nièxìng)** [constraining nature] is to sever life.
If the perfected are steadfast in the meaning of death and life,
and comprehend the logic of honor and disgrace,
then even if the whole world praises them, they are not further encouraged,
and even if the whole world criticizes them, they are not discouraged.
This is the essence of attaining the **至道 (zhiDao)** [perfected Dao/Way].

The **至人 (zhiren)** [perfected/sage] exist in every age,
but they are rare.
One in ten thousand is already considered many.
The study of the perfected is to return to the **华伪 (huapí)** [false and ornate] realm of nature,
and to bathe in the divine within the **虚静 (xūjìng)** [void and tranquil] domain.
They do not boast of their **德 (virtue)**,
nor do they flaunt their talents—
death and life bring no change to them,
and harm and benefit do not affect their hearts.
Now, the scholars of the world
abandon true nature to seek enlightenment,
pursue fame to elevate their reputation—
thus, the rise of deceit and decline of loyalty,
and the concealment of the true and upright.
If one seeks governance of the world
or personal peace and comfort,
it cannot be attained.

Laozi said:

In ancient times, those who ruled wore their hair unbound and had no **卷领 (juǎnlǐng)** [collared garments],
yet they governed all under heaven.
Their **德 (virtue)** was born without killing,
and they gave without taking.
Though the people did not wear their ceremonial robes,
they all shared the same heart of **德 (virtue)**.
At that time, yin and yang were in harmony,
and all things thrived and grew.
The nests of flying birds could be approached without alarm,
and wild beasts could be tethered and followed.
The sovereign of the Mysterious Old Dao
did not wear a hat or comb his hair,
but let his hair flow unbound,
and thus governed all under heaven.
He allowed the people to live in peace,
did not take their benefits—
thus the four seasons were harmonious,
and all things followed their nature.
Hence, the birds nested without fear,
and the beasts were tethered without alarm.
This was the peak of **德 (virtue)**.

When the age declined,
birds, beasts, insects, and serpents all became harm to the people,
so iron was cast and blades were forged to repel their dangers.
Thus, when the people were pressed by their difficulties,
they sought convenience and ease,
and when faced with calamities,
they took precautions.
Each used their cleverness to avoid what harmed them,
and to seek what benefited them.
Customs were no longer fixed,
and tools could not be relied upon as before—
thus the laws of the ancient kings were subject to change.
Hence it is said:
*"The nameable can be named,
but it is not the constant name."*
In the decline of the age,
things were no longer pure and singular,
but each gave rise to strange emotions,
harming one another in succession.
Cleverness and deceit were used to deceive,
and tools were made for defense,
to avoid what harmed and to seek what benefited.
Thus the ancient kings changed their laws,
not because there was a fixed standard—
hence, laws have no constant name.

The Five Emperors held different **Dao/Way (Dao)**,
yet their **德 (virtue)** covered the world;
the Three Kings had distinct affairs,
yet their names endured in posterity—
all adapted to the times.
It is like the **师旷 (Shiguang)** [Master Musician] tuning the Five Notes,
where the adjustments rise and fall without fixed measurement,
yet all are in harmony.
Thus, those who understand the emotions of music
can compose the sounds.

The root principle lies within,
and though the Five Emperors and Three Kings differed in their laws,
they were like Shiguang tuning the Five Notes,
mastering the essence of music,
and knowing the essence of harmony.

The Five Notes take *gong* as their root,
and the myriad households take the sovereign as their root.
Without a central root, there is chaos—
thus, a root is established to unify them.

Those who understand the use of compasses, squares, hooks, and cords
can govern the people.

Hence, when the ancient kings’ institutions were no longer fitting,
they were discarded;
when later ages’ affairs were good,
they were recorded.

Thus, the Sage’s establishment of rites and music
was not constrained by rites and music,
those who govern things are not constrained by things,
those who establish laws are not constrained by laws—
to establish rites contrary to rites,
to establish music contrary to music,
is to go against the Dao.

To let things be governed by things is tolerable;
to let laws be established contrary to laws
is to exceed proper governance.

Hence it is said:
*The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.*

Laozi said:
*The ancient Sage-Kings looked upward to the patterns of Heaven,
looked downward to the measures of Earth,
and took their laws from humanity.
They harmonized the yin and yang qi,
balanced the seasons’ rhythms,
and observed the suitability of highlands, lowlands, waters, marshes, and fertile plains.
They established affairs and generated wealth according to elevation and terrain,
eliminating the calamities of hunger and cold,
and warding off the disasters of sickness and misfortune.
Within, they received human affairs to establish rites and music,
practiced the Way of benevolence and righteousness to govern human relations;
they arranged the natures of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth
to establish filial piety and form the family;
they listened to the clear and turbid tones of the Five Notes,
and the generative cycles of the Six *Lü*,
to establish the proper relations of ruler and subject and form the state;
they observed the sequence of the four seasons—beginning, middle, and end—
to establish the order of seniority and juniority and form the bureaucracy;
they divided the land into regions and governed the states;
they established the Grand Academy to teach—
these are the fundamental principles of governance.

These are the six fundamental principles for governing the world.
When the Dao is attained, they are implemented;
when the Dao is lost, they are abandoned.

Things have never existed without tension and relaxation,
without flourishing and decline—
only the Sage can flourish without decline.

When the Sage first composed music,
it was to return the spirit and suppress licentiousness,
restoring the natural heart.
But when it declined,
it became excessive and unreturning,
indulging in sensuality and disregarding proper law,
spreading to later ages until kingdoms fell.

When they established writing,
it was to organize all affairs,
so the foolish would not forget,
and the wise would record events;
but when it declined,
it became a tool for deceit,
excusing the guilty and condemning the innocent.

When they established hunting grounds,
it was to prepare for ancestral temples
and to train soldiers against unforeseen dangers;
but when it declined,
they indulged in hunting and falconry,
wasting the people’s time
and exhausting their strength in leather and fur.

When they honored the worthy,
it was to spread teaching and justice,
placing the capable in office,
the skilled in their posts,
and letting their virtue descend to the people,
so all under Heaven cherished their virtue;
but when it declined,
they formed cliques and factions,
each promoting their own,
abandoning the public for private gain,
with outsiders and insiders aiding one another,
the unworthy in office,
and the worthy in hiding.

The Dao of Heaven and Earth:
when pushed to extremes, it reverses;
when increased, it diminishes.
Thus, the Sage corrects flaws and changes institutions,
and when matters conclude, they are renewed.
Their excellence lies in harmony,
their failure in expedience.

The Sage’s Way states:
Without cultivating rites and righteousness,
there is no establishment of propriety and shame—
and without propriety and shame, the people cannot be governed.
Without knowing rites and righteousness,
laws cannot be properly enforced.
Without elevating the good and abolishing the base,
one cannot turn toward rites and righteousness.
Without law, governance is impossible,
and without knowing rites and righteousness,
one cannot implement law.

Law can punish the unfilial,
but cannot make people filial;
it can punish thieves,
but cannot make people virtuous.

When the Sage-King rules above,
he clearly demonstrates good and evil to guide the people,
praises the worthy and censures the unworthy,
advances the worthy and demotes the unworthy,
and though punishments are set,
rites and virtue are cultivated,
and the worthy are entrusted with governance.

Thus, the highest in the world are the Three Dukes,
the highest in a region are the Nine Ministers,
the highest in a state are the Twenty-Seven Great Officers,
and the highest in a village are the Eighty-One Commoners.

Officials are appointed and duties divided,
the worthy are entrusted, and the corrupt removed,
to serve as the king’s limbs and senses,
harmonizing the myriad households
and pacifying the four quarters.

One who surpasses ten thousand is called *ying* (heroic),
one who surpasses a thousand is called *jun* (exceptional),
one who surpasses a hundred is called *jie* (outstanding),
one who surpasses ten is called *hao* (talented).

To understand the Dao of Heaven and Earth,
to grasp the principles of human nature,
to be vast enough to contain the many,
to be benevolent enough to embrace the distant,
to be wise enough to know expedience—
this is the *ying* person.

To have virtue sufficient for teaching,
conduct sufficient to uphold righteousness,
trust sufficient to win the people,
clarity sufficient to illuminate below—
this is the *jun* person.

To have conduct worthy of emulation,
wisdom sufficient to resolve doubts,
trust sufficient to keep agreements,
integrity sufficient to distribute wealth fairly,
actions worthy of imitation,
words worthy of following—
this is the *jie* person.

To fulfill one’s duties without neglect,
to act righteously without cliquishness,
to face danger without cowardice,
to reject gain without greed—
this is the *hao* person.

This is the method of selecting talent,
the means of knowing people.
If one possesses even one of these,
they can be used.
If they possess them all,
they are a Sage.

The heroic, exceptional, outstanding, and talented
are placed according to their greatness and smallness,
from root to branch,
with the heavy governing the light,
the ruler setting the tone and the people responding in harmony,
so all under Heaven unite in one heart,
turning away from greed and vulgarity,
toward benevolence and righteousness—
their influence on the people
is like the wind swaying the grass.

Now, if the unworthy rule over the worthy,
even severe punishments cannot restrain their deceit.
The weak cannot control the strong,
the small cannot govern the great—
this is the nature of Heaven and Earth.

Thus, the Sage selects the worthy to establish merit,
while the unworthy ruler promotes those like themselves.
By observing whom they promote,
one can discern order or chaos;
by examining their factions,
one can judge the worthy from the unworthy.

The Sage’s use of people
matches their talents,
and when officials do not overstep their ranks,
the world is governed.

The Master Laozi says:

Those who make **rites** carve and polish human nature,
straightening and restraining their feelings—
though the eyes may covet them,
they are checked by measure.
Though the heart may delight in them,
they are moderated by **rites**—
circumambulating, bowing low,
flesh stiff with hunger yet not eating,
wine offered yet not drinking,
the body bound in form,
the mind troubled, its voice imprisoned.
Their **virtue** restrains the harmony of yin and yang,
forcing the natural inclinations of life and death—
thus, they become sorrowful men all their days.

Why so? They do not root out the source of what is desired,
yet they restrain what is desired;
they do not trace the origin of what brings delight,
yet they prevent what brings delight—
this is like enclosing a beast without blocking its den,
restraining its wild heart,
or damning the flow of a river while trying to stop it with one’s hand.
Hence it is said:
*"Open its mouth, aid its work—
yet its life will never be saved."*

When the flaws of **rites** and **music** arise,
and the artifice of feelings is exposed,
they do not root out the absence of desire,
yet they restrict what is desired;
they do not trace the absence of delight,
yet they prevent what is delighted in—
then desire cannot be stopped,
delight cannot be restrained.
Delight, when unrestrained, leads to excess;
**rites**, when not properly observed, lead to neglect.
And from opening the pen to release the beasts,
from damning the river to halt its flow,
once truth is lost, all are bewildered and cannot return.

Now, **rites** are meant to curb feelings and close desires,
to defend oneself with **righteousness**—
though the feelings and heart may choke,
and desires may burst forth,
the body and nature hunger and thirst,
yet they endure what cannot be avoided—
thus, none can complete their natural lifespan.

To uphold **rites** is to be bound and constrained,
forced by feelings and nature,
all striving to endure—
thus, none complete their natural lifespan.

**Rites** do not make people not desire,
but they restrain desire;
**music** does not make people not delight,
but it restrains delight.

If one makes all under Heaven fear punishment
and thus dare not steal or rob,
is it not better to make them have no thieving heart?
If one does not open their cravings,
what need is there for dikes and walls?
If one does not amass wealth and goods,
there will be no thieves to steal or rob.

Thus, when one knows what is truly useless,
even the greedy will abandon it;
when one does not know what is truly useful,
the virtuous cannot yield to it.

That which causes the ruin of states,
death at the hands of others,
and laughter from all under Heaven—
has it not been desire?
The harm of desire is so great.

Who knows the uselessness of summer furs
and winter fans
will see all things turn to dust and filth.
Who knows the uselessness of all things
will see them become dung and soil.

Hence the Way teaches:
*"The harm lies with those who have desire."*

Thus, to cool boiling water with a ladle,
the boiling only worsens—
but to know its root,
one need only remove the fire.
None know the Way better than those who have no desire;
to stop the boiling lies in removing the kindling.

Laozi says:
*"To follow one’s nature and act is called the Dao;
to attain one’s natural essence is called **virtue**.*

Once nature is lost,
then **righteousness** and **benevolence** are prized—
but when **righteousness** and **benevolence** stand,
the Dao and **virtue** are abandoned.
Purity is scattered, **rites** and **music** take their place—
distinctions arise, the people are dazzled,
and jade and pearls are treasured—
all under Heaven contend.

When the Dao and **virtue** are gone,
**righteousness** and **benevolence** are insufficient to restrain their feelings,
**rites** and **music** are insufficient to curb their desires—
one man upholds them, yet a hundred men contend—
then chaos ensues.

Now, **rites** are meant to distinguish high and low, noble and base;
**righteousness** is meant to harmonize the relations of
ruler and subject, father and son, elder and younger brothers,
husband and wife, and all human interactions.

In the **end times**, **rites** become mere etiquette,
and **righteousness** is practiced through charity—
rulers and subjects criticize each other,
and kin bear grudges.

Thus, when water accumulates, it breeds devouring insects;
when earth accumulates, it spawns self-consuming hunters—
when **rites** and **music** are merely decorative,
deceit and falsehood arise.
Like one who fans a fire to burn oneself,
or throws oneself into water to drown.

Moreover, **rites** and **righteousness** originally have no nature of harming others;
water and fire, too, have no intent to harm—
but when they are used contrary to their proper Way,
they bring disaster;
when they are used in accord with their proper Way,
they bring blessing.

In the **end times**, governance does not accumulate means for nurturing life,
but pours out the pure and scatters the genuine—
it confuses the people,
taking what is clear for what is turbid,
and life and nature are scattered.
All strive to create chaos,
faith and sincerity decay,
people lose their nature—
law contradicts **righteousness**, actions oppose profit,
the poor and rich vie with each other,
and rulers and commoners are no longer distinguishable.

When there is excess, there is yielding;
when there is lack, there is contention—
yielding gives rise to **rites** and **righteousness**,
contention spawns violence and disorder.
Thus, many desires lead to unchecked actions,
and seeking indulgence brings endless strife.

Hence, in times of order, the petty man upholds propriety,
and profit cannot tempt him;
in times of chaos, the noble man becomes deceitful,
and law cannot restrain him.

Laozi says:
*"The rulers of the **end times**,
drill through mountains for stones,
pluck gold and jade,
dig up tortoises and turtles,
melt copper and iron—
yet all things do not flourish.

They hollow out wombs and burn the fields,
upset nests and destroy eggs—
phoenixes do not fly,
qilin do not roam.

They pile wood to build high platforms,
burn forests for hunting,
drain ponds for fishing,
heap earth to make artificial hills,
dig wells for drinking,
dredge rivers to make pools,
build walls for defense—
they trap beasts as livestock—
then yin and yang are disrupted,
the four seasons lose their order,
thunder and lightning are shattered,
hail and frost bring harm—
all things wither and die,
half of them perish,
and grasses and trees dry up in summer.*

The rulers of the **end times**,
split rocks to find jade,
dig clamshells for pearls,
burn the fields and drain the ponds,
hollow out wombs and destroy eggs—
they indulge the desires of their nature,
satisfy the pleasures of their ears and eyes—
thus, they bring about discord,
and all things lose their proper place.
Thunder and lightning strike in terror,
hail and frost bring ruin—
not the fault of all the lands,
but the crime of one man alone.

Hence, Xia Jie and Shang Zhou,
though their cities were not unhigh,
their jade and silk not few,
their allure not lacking,
their granaries not empty—
suddenly their ancestral lines were cut off,
their states ruined,
they died at the hands of others,
became the laughingstock of all under Heaven—
how painful was it not?

The **Way of Heaven** is not distant—it was in the **Xia** and **Shang** dynasties.

The Three Rivers ceased to flow.
The mountains and valleys were divided,
giving them boundaries and limits—
when the **Zhou** declined, the Three Rivers dried up.
When the **Jin** weakened, the **Sandu** and **Lu** lands collapsed.

When a state is about to rise,
it must have auspicious omens;
when a state is about to fall,
it must have **demonic portents** and calamities.

Counting the people’s numbers,
establishing ranks and divisions,
setting up traps and obstacles as defenses,
regulating the colors of clothing,
distinguishing noble and ignoble,
differentiating the worthy from the unworthy,
and enacting rewards and punishments—
then wars arise and contentious strife is born,
the innocent are slaughtered,
the guilty are executed without crime,
and thus, decline begins.

The **Heaven and Earth** cannot help but shift,
and the people cannot help but suffer disaster and peril.

**Laozi** said:
*"When the world is about to lose its **Dao/Way** and its life,
it is like the rise of the **yin** qi—
the ruler is dark and unclear,
the **Dao/Way** is abandoned and not followed,
**virtue/power** is extinguished and not displayed.
Actions go against **Heaven**,
commands defy the four seasons.
Spring and autumn shrink their harmony,
**Heaven and Earth** remove their **virtue/power**,
the sovereign sits uneasily in his position,
the ministers withdraw in seclusion and speak no more,
the officials twist the ruler’s intentions to ruin the norms,
they sever ties with kin to preserve their own safety,
wicked men flatter while secretly plotting,
they load the arrogant ruler with his own chaos,
and people act to fulfill his schemes.
Therefore, the ruler and his ministers are estranged and not affectionate,
kin are distant and not attached.
Fields yield no sprouts,
roads have no leisurely travelers,
stockpiled gold becomes tarnished,
walls crumble without repair,
tortoiseshells have no inner lining,
divination stalks are used daily,
and the world is divided yet made into one household.*

The feudal lords enact laws that differ,
customs become perverse,
they uproot their foundations and abandon their roots,
engrave the Five Punishments like carvings,
quibbling over the minutest details,
they slaughter and reap their people, taking half of them,
raise armies for destruction,
assault cities with indiscriminate killing,
overthrow the high and secure the low,
use heavy chariots,
build tall ramparts,
dismantle battle formations,
force soldiers into death paths,
confront stern enemies,
with ten attacks and one retreat,
their reputation may be grand,
they conquer lands and hold territories,
but the number of fallen corpses reaches tens of thousands,
and those who die from hunger and cold in their old age cannot be counted.

From this point onward,
the world has never known peace in its **Dao/Way** and life,
nor joy in its customs."*

The degenerate rulers of the end times,
relying on their might and expanding their lands,
exhausting the lives of the common folk,
quibbling over trifles,
with corpses piled and blood flowing without respite,
until this very day—
how could this be the **Dao/Way**?

The worthy and sagely rise in vigor,
upholding **virtue/power** and supplementing with **ren** and **yi**,
drawing near to enlighten the wise,
winning over the distant with their **virtue/power**,
unifying the world into one.
Their descendants succeed in assisting one another,
banishing the origins of slanderous flatterers,
silencing unproven arguments,
abolishing harsh laws,
removing burdensome regulations,
shutting out idle gossip,
sealing the gates of factions,
dulling sharp intellects,
following the Great Constant,
demolishing superficial forms,
discarding cleverness,
greatly harmonizing the obscure,
allowing all things to return to their roots.

The Sage does not create the times;
when the times arrive, they do not fail—
thus they cannot be interrupted.
The Sage perceives the moment,
seizes the time,
rises in vigor,
rectifying Heaven and Earth,
extinguishing brutality,
greatly sheltering the common folk.

When Heaven bestows great responsibility upon one,
they cannot be interrupted—
words must have their master.

Laozi says:
*"The depth of the Ying River,
ten *ren* deep yet untainted by dust,
gold and stone within reveal their forms without—
not because it is not deep and pure.
Turtles, fish, dragons, and serpents do not dwell there.
For water too pure, fish will not swim;
a man too scrutinizing, none will follow him.
No grains grow on barren rock,
no deer roam the bald mountain—
there is no shelter.
Thus, governing with harshness as scrutiny,
severity as clarity,
cruelty as loyalty,
and scheming as merit—
such methods are like stretching leather too wide,
the path to great ruin and splitting.
Governing with poetry leads to defeat,
stretching leather too wide leads to splitting.
When governance is stifling, the people are sincere;
when governance is probing, the people are depleted.
Excessive scrutiny above brings unrest below."*

Laozi says:
*"To govern a state, to employ strategy in war,
first establish an unbeatable governance,
then seek victory over the enemy—
to attack disorder with what is untamed
is like answering fire with fire, water with water.
The same cannot govern itself.
Thus, the strange is made effective:
strange stillness as agitation,
strange order as chaos,
strange abundance as hunger,
strange ease as toil,
strange rectitude clashing like water, fire, metal, wood—
where can one not prevail?

Thus, when **virtue/power** is balanced, the many defeat the few;
when strength is equal, the wise overcome the foolish;
when wisdom is matched, the calculated ensnare the incalculable.
This shows how rectitude and the strange attack each other,
the worthy and foolish contend.
Though great gains may be equal,
those who lead the multitude prevail;
though strength may be matched,
wisdom subdues the foolish;
though wisdom may be equal,
the cunning ensnare the uncunning.
Strategy and calculation—
these are all arts of mutual conquest,
alternately capturing and controlling,
yet not the **Dao/Way**—
this is the art of expedience."

The *Tongxuan Zhenjing* concludes its twelfth scroll.
