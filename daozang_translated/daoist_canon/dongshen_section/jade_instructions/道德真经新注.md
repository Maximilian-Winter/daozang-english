**Preface to the New Annotation of the *Dao De Jing***

The Dao of Nature is tranquil, and thus all things under Heaven are born within it.
Humans are the sovereign of all things, and thus they, together with Heaven and Earth, constitute the Three Powers (*san cai* 三才).
When the Venerable Lord Lao existed in the Western Zhou, he upheld the *Dao* and *virtue* (*de*) to rescue the customs of his age.
The *Dao* is the pure, natural Way.
*Virtue* (*de*) is that which is lost through neglect but attained through cultivation—this is called *virtue*.

Thus it is said: The *Dao* is vast, Heaven is vast, Earth is vast, and the Sage-King is vast—these are the Four Great Ones within the realm.
For the Sage-King governs by embodying the three natural mysteries: conforming to Earth, conforming to Heaven, and conforming to the *Dao*.
When the realm attains this, it is in peace, and this is called *virtue*.

Now, when speaking of "human," it is but a part of the whole—
Thus: *"Human conforms to Earth"*—like Earth’s impartial bearing.
*"Conforms to Heaven"*—like Heaven’s impartial covering.
*"Conforms to the Dao"*—like the Dao’s impartial generation and transformation.
This is as in the examples of *"Sovereign as Sovereign, Minister as Minister, Father as Father, Child as Child."*

Later scholars, failing to grasp the Sage’s intent, transmitted erroneous interpretations. The twenty schools of annotation all claim:
*"Human conforms to Earth, Earth conforms to Heaven, Heaven conforms to the Dao, the Dao conforms to Nature."*
This makes five great ones within the realm—contradicting the text and losing its true teaching!

Could it be that the Sage-King only conforms to Earth and not to Heaven or the *Dao*?
Moreover, if Earth conforms to Heaven, Heaven to the *Dao*, and the *Dao* to Nature, the logic becomes distant and convoluted.
Once the source is distorted, the branches grow confused.
Some revere it as an elixir scripture, others as a doctrine of emptiness.
Scholars do not say that the *Six Classics* came before the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, but this is mere vulgar talk—
They do not know that the *Six Classics* are but the branches and leaves of the Yellow Emperor’s teachings.

I, in my youth, grasped the essentials, and thus I clarify and expound upon them.
This is the art of purifying the mind, nurturing *qi*, and securing the family and the state.

**New Annotation of the *Dao De Jing*, Volume One**
*Annotated by Li Yue* (李约注)

The *Dao De Jing* begins thus:

The *Dao*’s nature is spontaneous and still,
And thus Heaven and Earth give birth to all things.
Things endure long before decaying,
Yet cultivation makes them revert to the *Dao*—
Hence it is called the *Dao*.

In all, there are thirty-seven chapters.
The *Dao* that can be spoken of,
If spoken of, is not the ultimate *Dao*.
The ultimate *Dao* is formless.
It is called "dimly luminous, faintly obscure."
The name that can be named,
If named, is not the ultimate name.
The ultimate name is nameless.
It is called "great" and "passing."

Without name, the origin of Heaven and Earth;
Here lies the subtlest essence of the *Dao*,
Seeking expression yet transcending speech,
Naming yet remaining beyond names.

The *Dao* gave birth to Heaven and Earth before humanity existed.
Without humanity, who could have named the *Dao*?
With name, all things take form.
Once the Three Powers are complete,
And myriad things assume their shapes,
The nurturing principle is clear,
And the names of mother and child are established.
The Sage thus begins to teach.

Always without desire, one beholds its mystery;
Always with desire, one sees its flaws.
Flaws are its boundaries.
Humanity’s greatest concern lies in desire and its absence.
Thus, those with desire do not wander in the *Dao*,
While those who forget it alone perceive its subtlety.

These two—same in origin, different in name—
In the *Dao* are one,
Yet in things are two.
They are called "mysterious."
Mysterious, like blackness.
If five colors are placed in darkness,
They cannot be distinguished.
To make disparate names unite as one,
This is called "mysterious within mysterious."
The more mysterious, the more it cannot be fathomed—
The gateway to all wonders.

Thus, one may reach the source of all transformations.
The world has its rulers.
All know beauty when it is called beauty—
Then ugliness arises;
If beauty differs from the common view,
Is it not already ugliness?
All know goodness when it is called goodness—
Then wickedness arises;
If goodness stands apart from the multitude,
Then it is truly wickedness.

Thus, being and non-being generate each other,
Opposites give rise to one another.
Difficulty and ease complete each other,
Successive transformations.
Long and short define each other,
Visible together.
High and low lean upon each other,
Giving rise to mutual strife.
Sounds and voices harmonize,
Yet do not act alone.
Before and after follow each other—
Distinct yet undetermined.

These are all proofs of the *Dao*’s workings above.
Hence, the Sage must not speak as others do.
He acts in non-action,
Placing his mind in perfect stillness.
He teaches without words,
Setting his own conduct as the model for all.

All things arise without his bidding;
He does not interfere, so nothing is lost.
He acts without claiming,
For what is done is his natural course.
He gives birth without possessing,
Letting things complete themselves—
This is his power; what need has he of it?
He acts without relying on it,
For what is achieved is his virtue—
What need has he to boast of it?

When virtue is fulfilled yet he does not dwell upon it,
This is why he is not abandoned.
Without effort yet in accord with principle,
This is called "not dwelling,"
And virtue naturally accomplished—
This is called "not being abandoned."

He does not exalt the worthy,
So the people do not contend;
If he does not exalt his own worth,
Who would dare to contend with him?
He does not prize difficult-to-obtain goods,
So the people do not steal;
If he does not covet what others desire,
All would naturally turn from it—
Who then would steal?

He does not show what is desirable,
So the heart remains undisturbed.
To all who oppose him,
He forgets them utterly—
Then the heart will naturally be still.

Thus, the Sage embodies these principles:
Empty his mind, and external things will not enter within.
Fill his belly, and the Original Unity will not leave without.
Weaken his resolve, and he will think only of softness.
Strengthen his bones, and he will preserve his essence.

Always make people ignorant and without desire,
And this is the principle—
Thus, humanity returns to simplicity.
Let the wise not dare to act,
And those who see the return to simplicity will strive to align with it.

Act in non-action,
And nothing will remain ungoverned.
Do not lose non-action,
And you will not suffer from disorder.

The *Dao* is open yet responds to all things,
Emptying himself to meet their needs.
Some do not fulfill their purpose,
So virtue is complete when its time arrives.

Deep and still, like the source of all things.
Deeply tranquil, unfathomable—
Thus, it appears as the teacher of all classes.

Dulling their sharpness,
He restrains the grasping of gain.
Unraveling their entanglements,
He resolves all grudges and resentments.
Blending their brightness,
He harmonizes their clarity.
Uniting their dust,
He enters their obscurity.

Gleaming yet indistinct,
Like something that may or may not exist.
His use is without differentiation,
His nature without mixture.
I do not know whose child he is,
But I recognize his ability—
No one knows his parent.
He resembles the state before the Emperor.

The Emperor is the origin of all things,
And all transformations follow after—
Only the *Dao* can dwell before him.

Heaven and Earth are not benevolent;
Benevolence is favor.
Favor arises from the heart,
And Heaven and Earth have no heart—
How could they be benevolent?
They treat all things as fodder for horses.
Fodder is grass;
Repayment springs from sentiment,
And fodder has no sentiment—
How could there be repayment?

The Sage is not benevolent,
Following the *Dao* of Heaven and Earth’s heartlessness,
Yet he empties his mind and rests in simplicity—
What need has he of benevolence?
He treats the people as fodder for horses.
The people, like fodder, are without sentiment,
Thus he forgets the Emperor’s power beneath them.

Between Heaven and Earth,
It is like a bellows.
The bellows has no bottom,
Yet when struck, it never ceases to produce heat—
At home, it uses wind to fan the flames.
The *zhi* is like a flute;
Skilled musicians blow into it to make music.
Both are empty within yet without sentiment,
Thus they respond endlessly to demands.

Heaven and Earth are like this,
Hence they are not benevolent.

「Empty yet never yielding, yielding is exhaustion.
Empty, thus never exhausted.
Move and it overflows—
Hence the more it moves, the more it responds.
Many words bring exhaustion,
Better to guard the center.

With intent to speak, then there is a time when it fails;
Empty within yet responding, then there is no day when it is exhausted.
The *Gu* spirit does not die—
Within the *Gu*, empty, it can echo with sound in reply.
Who knows the one that answers the sound?
Since it is unknown and unfathomable,
It is called the spirit—spirit answers, everlasting, why?

Humans can empty their hearts,
Then nothing fails to respond—
As the spirit never departs the body, everlasting.

This is called the *Xuan Dan*.
*Xuan* is profound darkness;
*Dan* is the female.

The female dwells in secluded chambers—
This is the *Xuan Dan*.
Its nature is soft and tranquil,
Not harming within from without,
Thus it can govern the unfathomable spirit within itself.

Again, the *Xuan* is the nose, the *Dan* is the mouth—
Empty and spacious, inhaling and exhaling the primordial *qi*,
The root of yin and yang.

The gate of the *Xuan Dan*—
This is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
To act as the *Xuan Dan*,
One may call it the gate to attaining the *Dao*.
Once the *Dao* is attained,
Then the *Dao* becomes the root of Heaven and Earth.

Endless and subtle, the *Dao*’s body
Seems unable to sustain itself,
Yet it exists eternally, from past to future.
Use it without exhaustion—
Though subtle, its application
Never declines in weariness.

If humans can attain it,
Then their nature is whole, their spirit sovereign—
Achieving boundless longevity.

Again, it speaks of the *tu nà* method.
Heaven is vast, Earth is enduring—
Now, the market has not yet lacked it.
Heaven and Earth endure long,
Because they do not generate themselves—
Thus they attain eternal life.
The reason they attain eternal life,
Is that they do not cultivate their own life yet possess it.

Thus the Sage can emulate Heaven and Earth.
Retreat behind his own body, yet his body advances—
The reason he surpasses others,
Is that he excels through self-effacement.

Exclude his own body, yet his body remains—
The reason he is not endangered,
Is that he can diminish himself.
Not because he lacks selfishness,
But because he can fulfill others’ selfishness—
Others’ selfishness may not succeed,
Yet his own selfishness is already fulfilled.

The highest virtue is like water.
The most virtuous person follows water’s nature.
Water benefits all things,
All things receive its nourishment.
Yet it does not contend—
It excels in humility and compliance.
Where people detest,
The lowest flows—
All the world’s detestations gather there,
People avoid it,
Water alone dwells there.
Thus it nears the *Dao*.
*Ji* means proximity.
Reside in the best land—
Quiet dwelling is best in land.
Heart is best in depth—
Calm the heart, best in depth.
Give with virtue—
Bestow giving, virtue excels.
Speak with trust—
Fulfill speech, trust excels.
Govern with skill—
Rule with governance, skill excels.
Do with ability—
Act with ability, ability excels.
Move with timing—
Motion with timing, timing excels.

Only because it does not contend,
Thus it has no blame.
*You* means fault—
Water’s nature is such,
Virtuous people follow it,
Thus they dwell in faultless ground.

Hold and fill it,
Better to stop and rest in the center.
*Yi* means cease.
Carry and sharpen it,
It cannot be long preserved.
Grind until it is sharpest,
Preserve its unbreakable nature—
This has never been heard before.
*Chuài* means to grind,
*Ruì* means thinness.

Gold and jade fill the hall,
Yet none can guard them;
Profit brings harm—
Accumulate, and it will kill the body—
Who says they can guard?

Rich and noble yet proud,
They invite their own misfortune.
High in station yet arrogant,
Disaster gathers itself—
How can they blame others?

Function accomplished,
Affairs fulfilled,
Retreat the body—
This is the *Dao* of Heaven.
To seek function and achieve it,
To plot affairs and see them through,
Then one should retreat the body,
Not dwelling in extreme heights—
This aligns with Heaven’s *Dao* of moderation.

Nurture the *hun* and preserve the *pò*—
Can one not depart from unity?
Human life must nurture the *hun*—
The *hun* is the yang spirit,
The yang spirit desires life.
The *pò* is the yin ghost,
The yin ghost desires death.
Thus, the *Laozi* teaches the method of guarding and nurturing,
So that the spirit does not recklessly depart and bring calamity.

The method of guarding and nurturing,
Has no greater principle than preserving unity.
Unity means singular focus—
Preserve a focused heart,
Thus the *pò* has no way to leave the body,
In harmony with the previous state.

Concentrate the *qi* to achieve softness—
Can one be like an infant?
To concentrate and nourish harmonious *qi*,
Can one reach the softness of a newborn’s body?

Purify and cast off the profound vision—
Can one be without blemish?
Profound vision is the heart—
The heart is clear and penetrating,
Though in the depths, it can survey and know.
All people have many desires,
Exhausting themselves without measure,
Thus flaws arise,
Unable to illuminate clearly—
Hence the command to use the *Dao* to wash and purify,
Removing its dust and burdens.

Love the people, govern the state—
Can one achieve *wu wei*?
If one’s body is cultivated,
One has never heard of their state not being well-ordered.
The people are the root of the state—
*Wu wei* is the key to governance.
If one attains the key to governance,
And applies it to their state,
This is called loving the people and governing the state.

The gates of Heaven open and close—
Can one act as the female?
Heaven aids those with virtue,
And the loving-people ruler uses the female principle—
Quiet and still, never straying from the *Dao*—
Thus the gates of Heaven remain open,
Granting them blessings and longevity,
Otherwise, they close.

Bright and all-pervading—
Can one be without knowing?
There is supreme virtue like the sun,
Illuminating all—
Can one make all beneath it unaware?
Born yet not possessed—
If possessed, then those beneath know.
Act yet not rely—
If relied upon, then it is not the Sage.
Long yet not domineering—
Things do not know where life originates.
This is called profound virtue—
The utmost of mysterious operation.

Thirty spokes converge at one hub—
When the hub is absent, the wheel’s use exists.
Initially, the wheel was formed,
With a single spoke as its rim—
Without thirty spokes, it could not revolve and move.
The wheel’s utility,
Depends on the emptiness within its frame.»

The utility arises from its non-existence—
Thus motion is accomplished.

Clay is shaped into vessels—
When their emptiness is honored, their use is realized.
In ancient times, vessels were formed by kneading clay and firing it,
And thus jars and bowls were made.
Hence, the vessel’s utility
Also depends on the void within.

Honoring non-existence,
Regulates one’s food and drink.

Doors and windows are carved for dwellings—
When their emptiness is honored, their use is realized.
When constructing a dwelling,
One cuts into hills and mounds to form walls,
Carves doors for entry and exit,
Opens windows for light,
And people dwell within—
Because the center is empty.

Honoring non-existence,
Averts stagnation and rigidity.

Thus, having is for utility—
Formed things rely on emptiness for their use.
Emptiness is for utility.

The Dao of void and non-being
Manifests its use through material forms.

Five colors blind the eyes—
Gazing long, they dim until one sees nothing,
Thus, blindness ensues.
Five tones deafen the ears—
Listening prolonged, they dull until one hears nothing,
Thus, deafness ensues.
Five flavors dull the palate—
Tasting without cease, one loses distinction,
Thus, insensitivity ensues.
Hunting and chasing drive the mind to madness—
Pursuing foxes and hares, exhausted without rest,
Thus, the mind’s madness ensues.
Rare treasures obstruct action—
Risking life for precious things,
No progress in virtue is made,
Thus, obstruction ensues.

Therefore, the Sage guides the Sage’s conduct
To suppress these five excesses.
These five excesses—
All people eagerly pursue them,
Yet do not know when to retreat,
So the Sage teaches the meaning of sufficiency.

Sufficiency for the belly, not for the eyes—
The eyes are insatiable; the Sage does not indulge them.
The belly knows contentment; the Sage provides for it.
Thus, discard the former, embrace the latter.
Discard the eyes—
They gaze outward—hence, "the former."
Embrace the belly—
It is filled within—hence, "the latter."

Honor and disgrace are like sudden alarm—
When honored, fear disgrace may follow.
When dishonored, reflect on faults.
This is called "honor and disgrace as alarm."

Treasure great calamity as the body—
Treasure the body and calamity arises.
Treasure calamity and the body is lost—
Thus, no calamity remains.

What is meant by "honor and disgrace as alarm"?
Honor is called "honor," disgrace is called "disgrace."
Honor is inferior; disgrace arises from honor,
Thus, disgrace is superior—
Like Ji Pi’s analogy of piled firewood.

Gaining it is like alarm—
Fear that disgrace may come.
Losing it is like alarm—
Reflect on past mistakes.
This is called "honor and disgrace as alarm."

What is meant by "treasure great calamity as the body"?
My great calamity arises because I have a body.
Treasure the body, and troubles beset every path.
When I have no body, what calamity remains?
When I do not cherish the body,
Forgetting its form,
I lose where calamity originates.

Thus, treasure the body for the sake of the world—
If one can entrust the world to it,
One who treasures the body as ruler
Will seek fine clothes and rich foods,
Exhausting the people’s resources—
Who would not resent this?
Entrusting the world to such a one
Is not enduring.

Thus, love the body for the sake of the world—
If one can entrust the world to it,
A ruler who loves the body
Will guard against disgrace,
Not troubling the people—
All will willingly attach themselves,
Entrusting the world to him.
To entrust is to suppress and bestow.

Seeing it yet not perceiving is called *yí* (平).
The eyes can discern colors,
But cannot grasp the Dao—
Thus, the seer gains only its flatness.
*Yí* is evenness—
A hazy indistinction, no variation seen.

Hearing it yet not hearing is called *xī* (希).
The ears can hear sounds,
But cannot listen to the Dao—
Thus, the hearer gains only its scarcity.
*Xī* is absence, or paucity—
Some never attain it, others do.

Seizing it yet not obtaining is called *wēi* (微).
The hands can grasp form,
But cannot grasp the Dao—
Thus, the seeker gains only its subtlety.
*Wēi* is marvelous—
Seemingly near, yet lost again.

These three cannot be forced or questioned,
Thus, they merge into one.

Above, it is not bright—
Below, it is not dark.
All things are bright above and dark below,
Yet the Dao is high without above,
Thus, it is not bright,
Low without below,
Thus, it is not dark.

Endless yet nameless—
Returning to nothingness.
Endless is long and unbroken,
Yet when its substance is demanded and named,
It returns to nothingness.

This is called the "form of non-form"—
Since it cannot be named,
It is truly formless,
Yet called "form"—
Why so?

Though the Dao’s clarity is not its form,
It truly generates from myriad forms,
Thus, it is called "form."

The image of non-being—
Not like the forms of things,
Which can be seen.

This is called *hǔhuǎng* (惚恍).
*Huǎng* is presence,
*Hǔ* is absence—
To say it is, is wrong;
To say it is not, is wrong,
Thus, it is named *hǔhuǎng*.

Approach it, yet see no head—
It has no coming.
Follow it, yet see no tail—
It has no going.

Hold fast to the ancient Dao
To govern the present.
Though not seen or heard,
Nor known through seeking,
It has existed since antiquity—
Called the Dao.
Now, to grasp and uphold it,
No method has been heard.
The method lies in a vacant heart—
If the heart can truly vacate,
The Dao will come of itself,
Then grasp it to govern all things—
Nothing will escape proper order.

To know the ancient beginning—
This is called the "memorial of the Dao."
The Dao is the origin of antiquity;
If one knows and practices it,
This is called attaining the principles of transformation.

In ancient times, the virtuous scholar—
There were those who spoke of ancient times,
Who practiced the Dao as scholars.
Subtle, mysterious, and penetrating,
Deep beyond comprehension.
Alone they explored the utmost Dao,
Exhausting its subtlety,
Their walls towering and profound,
Impenetrable to sight.
Because it cannot be known,
They forcefully describe its appearance:
The Dao dwells in the heart,
Not manifest in expression,
Thus, people cannot recognize it.

「When one seeks to transform and guide others,
Therefore, one forcefully describes its form.
The form is used to awaken understanding of things.

It is like crossing a river in winter—
In the winter season, solid ice must form,
Yet those who cross the river have no fear of slipping and drowning,
Because they are at ease.
It is also like fearing one’s neighbors—
Though dwelling in seclusion, one remains untouched,
Yet still one fears as if traces might be left behind.

One conceals oneself like a fugitive,
Dreading that neighbors might know.
One appears dignified like a guest,
For one’s actions are without contrivance,
Like a guest’s natural bearing.

One is fluid like ice about to thaw,
Yet does not cling or stagnate,
Like water that floats freely.

One is sincere like uncarved wood,
Yet one fears it might drift without returning,
And so one contemplates returning to its origin.
Empty like a valley—
A valley’s hollow space holds all.
One is turbid like mud,
Yet not merely clear.
Who can settle the turbid with steady stillness to gradually become clear?
Only the virtuous scholar.

Who can remain tranquil through prolonged movement to gradually bring forth life?
To rest in what is already at rest,
Yet to come and go in turn—
This is the Way of the virtuous scholar.

Those who adhere to this Way
Do not seek to be full.
For fullness leads to loss.
Only by not being full
Can one preserve what is newly formed.
Only by not being full
Can one preserve what is newly formed.

To attain utmost emptiness,
To steadfastly uphold stillness—
Steadfastness means depth.
When one seeks to gather the Dao within oneself,
One must first attain its emptiness.
If emptiness reaches its utmost,
The Dao will surely come of itself into one’s being.

All things arise together,
I observe their return.
I fear people may not yet believe
That upholding stillness is the path to attaining the Dao,
So I use this analogy to clarify it.

When all things move and arise,
I observe their decline and fall,
For all vital qi inevitably returns to stillness.

Things are myriad and flourishing,
All return to their roots.
Things are myriad and lush in growth until autumn.
At the intersection of autumn and winter,
No living essence fails to return to its root—
Because the root is stillness.

Returning to the root is called stillness;
If one moves, one cannot return to life.
Stillness is called "returning to the vital breath."
By the tenth month, the qi of all things returns to their roots.
After the Winter Solstice,
A single Yang arises,
And then buds and movement begin.
This cycle of return is the root of Nature’s Way.

Returning to the vital breath is called "constancy";
Constancy is the Dao of life.
To know constancy is called "clarity";
Clarity is knowledge.
To not know constancy is to act recklessly, bringing disaster.
If one is ignorant of constancy,
All one’s actions will be in vain,
And one will surely fail to meet with good fortune.

To know constancy is to embrace universality;
An empty heart can know constancy,
Thus one can embrace all.
Universality is fairness;
Fairness means to embrace without exclusion,
Which is to act without selfishness.

Fairness is called "sovereign";
Without selfishness, all things will return and attach themselves.
Sovereignty is called "heavenly";
The sovereign Way has no bias,
Like the heaven’s covering all.

Heaven is the Dao;
Its function is immeasurably great,
Yet it can also forget itself.

The Dao endures forever;
If one forgets the sovereign’s principle,
How can one’s blessings and longevity be feared?
One’s body may perish, yet no harm befalls.

Love extends even to the Sweet Osage,
Yet will one wash away its people?
To say that the ultimate person
Establishes deeds, affairs, teachings, and laws,
Enduring through all ages—
When the body departs, the spirit remains.

**The New Annotations of the *Zhenjing of Dao and Virtue* conclude, Volume One. Volume Two begins.**

**The *Dao De Jing* (Lower Section) – Li Ye’s Annotation**

The Sage-King knows what is beneath;
The ancient rulers were known only by their subjects—
They never issued decrees.

Next, they were loved and praised;
They were loved because of their virtue,
Praised because of their benevolence.

Next, they were feared and reviled;
The upright feared them,
The deceitful reviled them.

When trust is lacking, distrust arises.
At first, they lured with falsehood—
This is why trust was lacking.
Later, they showed sincerity—
Yet people still did not believe them.

They still valued words.
Not knowing that words should be valued less than trust,
They reached this ruin—
Yet they still valued words,
So the pure and harmonious winds could not prevail.

When deeds were accomplished and affairs settled,
The people said, *"It happened naturally."*
Because there were no teachings or laws,
This custom arose.

When the Great Dao declined, there were benevolence and righteousness;
The Great Dao did not decline to avoid benevolence and righteousness,
But because benevolence and righteousness were established,
The Great Dao had no choice but to decline—
For it was the age of abandoning the root to exalt the branches.

When wisdom arose, great deceit followed;
Wisdom did not arise to foster great deceit,
But great deceit could not help but arise—
Because it relied on traces to take form.

When the six kinsfolk were not harmonious, filial piety and kindness emerged;
On days when fathers were kind and sons filial,
Would there be the fame of Zeng Shen?
When states were chaotic and corrupt, loyal ministers arose.
In times when rulers were virtuous and ministers upright,
Where would the resolve of Bi Gan come from?

To abandon the sage and discard wisdom,
The people’s benefits increase a hundredfold;
To abandon the sage and discard wisdom
Is to have no laws or decrees.
With no laws or decrees,
The people need not fear transgression.
When the people fear no transgression,
They act freely in life—
Compared to the time of Han Xin’s calculations,
Their gains are not merely a hundredfold.

To abandon benevolence and discard righteousness,
The people return to natural filial piety and kindness;
To abandon the artificial benevolence and righteousness,
The world does not uphold the unattainable laws—
All return to natural filial piety and kindness.

To abandon cleverness and discard profit,
Thieves and robbers vanish.
To abandon extraordinary cleverness,
Then profit is balanced.
When profit is balanced,
Then the people each have enough.
When the people each have enough,
Who would become thieves and robbers?

These three [principles] are insufficient for cultivation,
So four more are added.
*Seeing* the unadorned and discarding stains—
Embracing simplicity, guarding the root—
Fewer desires, forgetting self—
Few desires.
Losing the paired—
Discarding artificial distinctions.

To abandon learning and have no worries.
If one studies worldly affairs,
Every action brings regret and hesitation—
Thus, there is worry.
*"Yes"* and *"Ah"*—how far apart are they?
*"Yes"* and *"Ah"* arise from the mouth,
Yet bring changes of joy and anger.
Good and evil—how far apart are they?
Good and evil arise from the heart—
How distant is it from the Hu-Yueh divide?

What people fear, one must fear.
What people fear, one must truly fear—
If not, calamity will arise.

Wild and endless—
The learning of the world is like this:
The natural disposition grows daily more desolate,
With no end in sight.

The multitude bustles and thrives,
Pursuing desires like feasting on the grandest sacrifice.
Like ascending the Spring Terrace—
Their lustful desires only grow.

I alone stand in dread, as yet unmanifest,
Like an infant before it speaks.
Laozi said:
*"I have long abandoned worldly learning.
Now, even seeing it, I am filled with dread—
It has not yet taken form,
Like an infant before it speaks,
Not yet knowing human intentions."*

Steadfast and unyielding—
As if having nowhere to return.
*Steadfast* means riding what one rides.
The Sage has no intent—
Whatever is encountered, they ride it forward.
How would they know to distinguish this from that
And call it returning?

The multitude all have excess—
In worldly learning, they seem to have surplus strength.
I alone seem abandoned.
Only I, in worldly learning,
Seem as if divine insufficiency has left me forgotten.

I am the heart of the foolish—
No, it is not.
Pure and unadorned—
The simple and unrefined have not yet scattered—
Thus, it is called *pure*.
The vulgar are sharp and discerning,
Exhibiting rigid friendships.
I alone am muddled—
As if lacking ability.
The vulgar are bright and clear,
Boasting knowledge.
I alone seem dim—
As if hiding the essence.
Vast as the sea, tranquil and solitary—
Like a hollow boat drifting on the great waters,
Never stopping or anchoring.

The multitude all have purpose—
Thus, they are not at ease.
I alone seem dull and crude—
I alone do not know of worldly affairs,
My stupidity like that of the border folk.

I alone differ from others—
In form, like the crowd;
In heart, wandering beyond things.

Yet I value nourishment from the Mother.
The Mother is the Dao.
Nourishment is sustenance.
What makes me differ from others
Is that I seek sustenance from the Dao.
The Dao, because I can abandon worldly learning,
Often nourishes me with the original harmony and subtle qi.

The vast virtue’s capacity—
Only the Dao follows it.
*Vast* means extreme.
*Capacity* means reception.
*Follows* means to conform.
Those with virtue,
Their hearts pure and empty,
Only receive the supreme Dao
And follow it in action.

The Dao, as a thing,
Is only vague and indistinct.
The Dao, though vague and indistinct, is not without form—
*Vague* means absence.
*Indistinct* means presence.
*Within* refers to the heart.
*Form* means the boundless form.
If the heart is vague—
Without things—
Yet becomes indistinct—
With desires—
Then the Dao transforms into boundless form.

If the heart is indistinct—
With desires—
Yet returns to vague—
Without desires—
Then the Dao transforms back into wondrous things,
Deeply dwelling within the heart.

Profound and dark—
Within it is essence.
*Profound* means deep.
*Dark* means obscure.
*Essence* is the Dao’s wonder.
Speaking of the Dao’s wondrous qi,
Entering and exiting all things,
Yet unseen—

The **sovereign**—
Only the one with a **void-heart** can attain it.

Its **essence** is most **true**,
Obtaining the **unborrowed essence**,
Thus becoming a **True Person**.

Within it is **faith**.
If one’s **sincerity** can void the heart,
Then the **essence** will respond and not be lost.

From ancient times to now,
Its name does not fade—
Ancient is just like the present,
And the present person, sensing its response,
Knows that the ancients’ sensing was likewise.

**Observe the multitude of beginnings**—
*Observe* means to **search and verify**.
*Beginnings* mean the **first stirrings**.

Searching and verifying ancient origins,
Those who attained the Dao were many—
Each and all obtained it through **desirelessness**.

How do I know this of the multitude of beginnings?
Thus:

The **Laozi** said:
How do I know those who attain the Dao are such?
By their **highest actions**, I recognize them.

**Bend** and you are **whole**—
Nothing is unyielding,
Who can harm you?
**Crooked** makes you **straight**—
**Flexing** yet silent,
Ultimately, it will **self-express**.

**Low** and you are **full**—
Only the **lowest of the low**,
And the world’s heart is drawn to them.

**Worn** and you are **renewed**—
Not clinging to what you’ve gained,
Only then can you **advance and refine**.

**Few** and you **attain**—
Not dividing your **intent**.
**Many** and you are **bewildered**.

They love to **follow the crowd**—
Thus the **sage** embraces **Oneness** as the **model for all under heaven**,
Only adhering to the Dao,
And none under heaven dare defy.

Not **self-revealing**, so **clear**;
**Hide** your **capacity**, and it will **inevitably shine**.
Not **self-righteous**, so **illuminated**;
**Lose** your **self-righteousness**, and it will **become apparent**.

Not **self-proud**, so **long-lasting**;
**Offering** your **shortcomings**, your **length** returns.
Not **self-praising**, so **fruitful**.

Only the one who **does not dwell** upon it,
Thus does not **abandon** it.
Only the one who **does not contend**,
None under heaven can **contend with** them.

Their **conduct** is as **flexible as water**,
And none dare **not submit**.

What was called **"Bend and you are whole"**—
Is it not a **hollow phrase**?
It is **whole** and **returns**—
Only act **appropriately**, and the **effect** will **self-manifest**.
**Sparse speech** is **natural**.

The **cautious in speech**,
Not only **few in blame**,
But also **harmonize with the Dao’s natural Way**.

**Gales** do not last the morning,
**Sudden rains** do not last the day.
These two, **injuring things** too severely,
Thus cannot endure long.

Who does this?
**Heaven and Earth**.
Heaven and Earth, though **greatest in form**,
Are **spoiled by violent winds and torrential rains**,
Yet dare not **endure long**.
How much more so for **humans**—
With **utterances** so **abundant**,
Yet **harming the Dao’s natural qi**?

Thus, those who **pursue the Dao**,
**Sparse in speech**—
Such is the **true person**.

**Daoists** align with **Dao**,
**Virtuous ones** align with **virtue**,
**Lost ones** align with **loss**.
Each **gathers their own kind**.

Align with **Dao**, and **Dao** will **align with you**;
Align with **virtue**, and **virtue** will **align with you**;
Align with **loss**, and **loss** will **align with you**.

**Kindred** meet—
All **find accord**.

**Faith** insufficient,
There will be **doubt**.
**Doubt** **sparse speech** **harmonizing with Dao**,
Yet **seeking** **retribution through many words**,
Then **regret** and **seek** it—
Even if you **utter sincere resolve**,
Those who **pursue the Dao** will still not **trust you**.

**Stilted** cannot **stand**—
**Stilted heels**,
Cannot **endure long**.
**Striding** cannot **walk**—
**Striding wide**, how can you **reach far**?

**Self-revealing** is **not clear**,
**Self-righteous** is **not illuminated**,
**Self-praising** is **not fruitful**,
**Self-proud** is **not long-lasting**.

From **stilted** and **striding** arise **self-revealing** and such **conducts**—
These are all **empty actions**,
And **transgressing the natural**,
One **fault** in the **body**,
And you become **cast out by humanity**—
How much more so if **both** are present?

In **Dao**, it is called **"excess food, superfluous limbs"**—
Its **repulsiveness**,
Like **leftover food**,
Like **excess flesh** on the **form**.

**Things** may **abhor** it,
Thus **Daoists** are **unsettled**.

Common **trivialities**,
Even **susceptible to objection**,
Yet **Daoists** **do not dwell** upon these.

There is a **thing** **mixed and complete**,
Born before **Heaven and Earth**.
When **Original Qi** **condenses and congeals**,
Not yet **Heaven and Earth**.

**Silent** and **vast**—
**Supreme void**, **supreme stillness**.
**Standing alone**, yet **unchanging**,
Not **mingling with things**,
Nor **following things’ transformations**.

**Circulating endlessly**, yet **never exhausted**,
**Fully manifesting** within **all things**,
And **never** at **risk** at any time.

It can be the **mother of all under heaven**—
**Capable of nurturing and giving birth**.

I **do not know** its name,
No **attainment** to **call** it by.
**Forcibly** name it **Dao**—
*Dao* to **express virtue**,
For it possesses the **virtue of giving birth to Heaven and Earth**,
Thus **name it Dao** to **express** it.

**Forcibly** name it **Great**—
*Great* to **summon reality**,
For it **embodies nothing**—
Thus **name it Great**.

To **demonstrate** to **all people** who wish to **cultivate**,
There will be **what is called**.

**Great** is **passing**—
Once **passed**, it is **no longer in Greatness**.
**Passing** is **far**—
And **passing** again **loses its place**.
**Far** is **return**—
**Pursuing** the **far** is **unattainable**,
Suddenly **returning** to the **void-heart**.

Thus, **Dao is Great**,
**Heaven is Great**,
**Earth is Great**,
And the **King** is also **Great**.
Though the **King** cannot **compare** with the **Three Great**,
Their **greatness** is **ranked below**.

Within the **domain** are the **Four Great**,
And the **King** occupies **one** of them.

**Dao**, having **descended** to the **Three Great**,
All **originate from Dao**.
The **King**, having **ascended** above the **Three Great**,
All **order the King’s laws**.

**Humans follow Earth**—
Earth’s **virtue** is **stillness and bearing** while **giving birth to things**,
Those who **follow** it **make it like Earth**,
Thus called **"Earth-Earth"** for **Earth’s likeness**.

**Follow Heaven**—
Heaven’s **virtue** is **broad coverage without partiality**,
Those who **follow** it **make it like Heaven**,
Thus called **"Heaven-Heaven"** for **Heaven’s likeness**.

**Follow Dao**—
Dao’s **nature** is **forgetting merit**,
Those who **follow** it **make it like Dao**,
Thus called **"Dao-Dao"** for **Dao’s likeness**.

**Follow the natural**—
If **humans** can **follow** the **Three**,
All **become One**,
Then you can be called **King**,
And you are **one person among ten thousand**.

Speaking of **Earth, Heaven, Dao**—
The **Three**, all possess **natural wondrous principles**,
The **King** should **follow** them.

**Natural principles**—
This is **covering and bearing**, **generating and completing**, yet **not partial**.
**Stillness** is the **root of agitation**,
All things **generate from roots**—
Because **roots are heavy**.

「Thus all ten thousand people are without fail subject to the rule of the **King**,
For the **King** embodies **stillness**.

Therefore, the **King**’s conduct never strays from his **wagons and provisions** throughout the day.
The **King** who seeks to achieve anything must first prepare his **wagons and provisions**,
To guard against the miseries of cold, heat, hunger, and want.

Though there are palaces of splendor and places of leisure,
He remains detached and serene.
Detached and serene—
This is the appearance of **transcending and releasing**.
**Palaces of splendor** are the Spring Platforms,
**Places of leisure** are where the **burning** (燕) birds dwell,
These are all the **abodes of refinement** (治容).
Those who uphold **stillness** and **substance** can truly **transcend and release**.

Yet how can the sovereign of a **ten-thousand chariot** realm treat his own body so lightly before the people?
All things, both **humans** and **non-humans**, uphold **stillness** and **substance**—
How can the ruler of the realm not value his own body,
Yet make his comings and goings so **light**?

**Lightness** leads to losing his **ministers**,
**Lightness** in his actions makes governance difficult,
Thus he loses the **hearts of his ministers**.
**Agitation** leads to losing his **Kingdom**.
If his **emotions and nature** are **agitated**,
And he does not **settle himself in stillness**,
Then he will lose his **Kingdom**.

**Good conduct** leaves no trace,
**Following Dao** leaves no trace.
**Good speech** has no flaws or censure,
**Speaking of Dao** has no censure.
**Good calculation** does not rely on tools or reckoning—
**Upholding stillness and purity**, he needs no tools or reckoning.
**Good closure** requires no locks or bars yet cannot be opened—
**Closing** the seven orifices and all gates,
No **demons** can enter.
**Good binding** requires no cords or knots yet cannot be undone—
**Purifying** the five **zang** organs and all **spirits**,
External things cannot tempt him.

Thus, the **Sage** is always **good at rescuing people**,
Hence there are none he **abandons**;
Always **good at rescuing things**,
Hence there are none he **abandons**.
**Hidden actions** like those above—
The **Dao** permeates even **grass and trees**,
How much more so among **humans**?

This is called **"Covering Brightness"**.
**Inner conduct** yet **no outward display**.
Thus, the **good person** is the **teacher** of the **not-good person**;
The **good person** can **give goodness** to others.
The **not-good person** is the **material** of the **good person**.
**Material** means **supplying**.
The **not-good person** is what the **good person** can **supply** with.
If one does not **honor his teacher**,
Or **love his material**,
Both reach **Dao**,
And then **forget each other**.

Though knowing **great confusion**,
This is called **"Essential Marvel"**.
**Forgetting teacher and material**—
The common people call it **confusion**,
But **Dao** calls it **marvelous**.

Know **its masculine**,
Yet **guard its feminine**—
Then you become the **deep valley** of the world.
Though you possess **masculine and martial** talents,
If you **feminine and subdue** them as your **heart**,
Then all will **gather to you**,
Like the world’s **deep valleys**.

To be the **deep valley** of the world—
**Constant virtue** never departs,
**Humility’s virtue** never leaves your body,
Then you are like a **valley** where all **streams** converge.

Return again to the **Infant Brother**.
**Harmonious qi** fills the **body**.

Know **its white**,
Yet **guard its black**—
Then you become the **model** of the world.
**Model** means **law**.
**Concealing white as black**,
Then all under heaven dare not but **submit**.

To be the **model** of the world—
**Constant virtue** never errs,
**Embrace this virtue of obscurity and use it**,
And your body will always be **without fault**.
Return again to **Non-Extremity**.

Its **virtue** is such—
Thus **blessings and longevity** are **unmeasurable**.

Know **its glory**,
Yet **guard its disgrace**—
Then you become the **valley** of the world.
If you **treat glory as disgrace**,
Then your **measure** is like a **valley**,
**Accepting all without distinction**.

To be the **valley** of the world—
**Constant virtue** is then **sufficient**,
**Measure** without exclusion,
**Virtue** without deficiency,
Return again to **Non-Extremity**.
**Non-Extremity** is the **origin** of all **vessels**,
When **virtue is complete**, it can **return to origin**.
**Origin** is **Dao**.
**Non-Extremity** **scattered** becomes **vessels**,
**Vessels** **circumscribed** by **use**—
**Dao** **scattered** then all **vessels** are formed.

The **Sage** **uses** it and becomes **officials and leaders**,
The **Sage** **uses Dao**,
Standing above all **talents**,
**Guiding and transforming** those who do not **know the bright Dao**.
Thus, **great governance** does not **sever**.

**Holding** the **Great Dao**,
Thus he can **govern and subdue** all **living beings**,
He must **guard it with Non-Action**,
Not **adding punishments or laws**.

If one intends to **take the world** yet does so,
He seeks the **world’s favor**—
I see this as **inevitable failure**.

If one **takes with Action**,
I see this will **inevitably fail**.
**Inevitable** is a **grammatical particle**.

The **world** is a **divine vessel**—
It cannot be **taken by force**.
**Divine vessel** means **human**.
**Humans** **inhabit spirits**,
Thus called **divine vessel**.
**Human nature** is **evil and chaotic**,
**Action** **disturbs** people,
Thus it is known that one cannot **take the world by force**.

**Action** leads to **ruin**,
**Forcing** leads to **people scattering**.
**Grasping** leads to **losing it**,
If one **does not trust** **profound words**,
And **clings stubbornly** to his **original intent**,
Then he will **inevitably lose** the **imperial realm**.

Thus, **things** either **move** or **follow**,
If **Action** is **pursued** before,
It will **inevitably lead to ruin** and **losing those who follow**.

Either **breathing** or **blowing**,
**Ren’s virtue** is called **breathing** (陶),
**Severe punishment** is called **blowing**.
Either **strong** or **weak**,
When the **people are at ease**, they are **strong**,
When the **people scatter**, they are **weak**.
Either **supporting** or **overthrowing**,
**Caressing** them leads to **supporting**,
**Cruelty** leads to **overthrowing**.

Thus the **Sage** **removes excess**,
**Removes extravagance**,
**Removes excessiveness**.
The **verification** of **Action** is so **excessive**,
How can the **ruler of the world** not **remove it**?

With the **Sage’s governance**,
He **approaches** those within it who **remove excess**,
**Remove extravagance**,
And **excessiveness**.

**Assisting** the **sovereign** with **Dao**,
Not **assisting** with **arms**.
The **ancient** **good advisors**,
**Calming the people** and **strengthening the realm**,
Then **Dao** is used, not **arms**.

Their **affairs** **love to return**.
The **victorious general**,
His **army’s footsteps** not yet **returned**,
Already **reported** by the enemy.
Where the **army** **dwells**,
**Thorns and brambles** **grow**.
**Obstructing** farming and **weeding**,
Thus **thorns and brambles** **grow**.
After a **great army**,
There will **inevitably** be **years of hardship**.
After **warfare and slaughter**,
The **killing qi** still **lingers**,
**Harmony and balance** have not yet **restored**,
No **fine grains** will **sprout**.

Thus, **goodness’s fruit** is **all that is pursued**,
And one **dares not** to **take by force**.
**Assisting** the **sovereign** **must align** with **Dao**,
Not **align** with **arms**.
If **inevitable failure**,
Then **choose** his **good generals**,
Who **must** be **resolute** yet **not** **pursue victory** for its own sake.

**Resolute** yet **not arrogant**,
**Resolute** yet **not boastful**,
**Resolute** yet **not proud**,
**Resolute** yet **inevitable failure**—
This is **resolute** yet **not forcing**.
If a **good general** leads **armored soldiers** to **punish evil**,
He **must** be **resolute** yet **not arrogant**,
**Not boastful**,
**Not proud**—
Why?
For **resoluteness** comes from **humility**,
Not **resoluteness** from **forcing**.
**Forcing** is **contrary to Dao**.

**Things** reach **peak strength** yet **grow old**—
This is called **"Not Dao"**.
**Things** reach **peak strength** yet **grow old**,
**Arms** reach **peak strength** yet **not necessarily** **victory**,
All are **contrary to Dao**.

「Not Dao is early failure.
To know what is contrary to Dao,
And be able to stop early—this is good.

**Stopping** is **cessation**.
The **good general** who loves war
Is an **omen of misfortune**—*good*, meaning fondness.
War is the **instrument of harm**,
And fondness of war is not **virtue**.
**Things** may be evil,
Thus the **Daoist** does not dwell there.
All **things** cherish life and abhor death,
And if a realm loves war,
Even common **things** will detest it—
How much more so the **Daoist scholar**,
Who would dare to reside in such a realm?

A **gentleman** in **peace** holds the **left** in esteem,
For he embodies **仁 (rén)** to nurture others,
And in **peace**, he must occupy the **position of life’s flourishing**.
In war, he holds the **right** in esteem.
The **commander of war** takes killing as his purpose,
Thus his use must be **aligned with the path of destruction**—
War is an **omen of misfortune**,
Not the **instrument** of a **gentleman**.
A **gentleman**’s **instrument** is **cultural virtue (文德)**,
Not **weapons of violence (干戈)**.
When he **must** use it,
Though not his own **instrument**,
It is **not obtained otherwise**.

**Serenity and simplicity** are supreme.
The **flavor** of his use is **not** in **victory**,
For **victory** is **not** **beautiful**—
He values **serenity and simplicity** above all,
Thus **victory** is **not** **beautiful**.
But those who find it **beautiful**,
Rejoice in killing—*love*, meaning fondness.
If one takes **victory** as **beautiful**,
Then he is **fond of killing**—
He who rejoices in killing
Cannot fulfill his **aspirations** in the world.
All detest death—
Who would willingly **submit** to it?
Thus **auspicious matters** are **esteemed on the left**,
**Inauspicious matters** on the **right**.
Each follows its **kind**.

The **general of the left** dwells on the **left**,
Though he is the **official of killing**,
He lacks the **authority to kill**.
The **general of the right** dwells on the **right**,
Specializing in **campaigns and conquests**.
*Speaking* of **funeral rites**,
He is placed **near the coffin**.
Killing many,
He **lamented and wept**—
The **gentleman** as **general** would say:
*"Truly, I lack **virtue**,
The people have **no guilt**—
In one day, I slaughter and wound them,
Nearly driving them to **death**."*
Thus, **speaking of war**,
His **tears followed**—
The **victory** of war was **treated as funeral rites**.
Placing him in that position,
He need not **wear its garments**,
But **first**, to **align with its killing qi**,
And **second**, to **restrain the heart** of the **warlord**.

**Dao** is **always nameless**—
Now I name it **Dao**,
This is **forcing a name**.
Though **primordial simplicity (朴)** is small,
It is **such that one cannot see it**.
The world **dares not** to **submit** to it.
Holding **Dao** within,
He is still **worthy as a teacher** to the **sage-king**—
How much more so would he **dare to submit** to **Dao** as a **servant**?

If **marquis-kings (侯王)** could **guard** it,
The world would **voluntarily submit**.
*Submit*, meaning **to obey**—
If one **guards Dao** without forgetting,
Then none would **fail to submit** from afar.
**Heaven and Earth** unite,
And **descend sweet dew (甘露)**—
When **Heaven and Earth** exchange **harmony (泰)**,
They can **descend sweet dew**,
Thus **marquis-kings** who **guard Dao** are **signified**—
No one **commands** them,
Yet all **become equal**.

The **Way of the Sage** has **no bias**,
Thus his **virtue and grace** are **evenly bestowed**—
Why **await orders**?
At the **beginning of governance**, names are **established**,
Yet **Dao** reaches this point—
Only then can it **subdue and serve** the **named**.
The **named** are the **spirits of mountains and rivers**,
And the **scholars of forests and springs**.
Names are **already established**.
Thus, when **named spirits** are **enshrined**,
They **must submit** to **funeral rites**,
And **scholars of forests and springs**,
Though **exhausted from their labors**,
Will **all emerge** to **pay respects**.

He who **knows how to stop** will **not** be **endangered**—
*Endangered*, meaning **in peril**.
The **named** rely on the **Daoist ruler**,
And **find peace** in **auspicious lands**—
How much more so the **common folk**?

**Dao** in the world
Is like **streams and valleys** to the **great rivers and seas**.
The **Daoist ruler** in the **world**,
When **ruler and subject align with Dao**,
**Superior grace flows downward**,
**Inferior emotions reach upward**,
Like **streams and valleys** flowing into the **great rivers and seas**.

He who **knows others** is **wise**—
The **wise** are **not confused**,
Thus he **knows others**.
He who **knows himself** is **clear**—
The **clear** see **before things manifest**,
Thus he **does not tread upon what is contrary to Dao**.

He who **overcomes others** has **strength**—
Others **overcome others** by **power or might**,
But he who **overcomes himself** is **powerful**.
He who can **cultivate virtue** to **subdue others**
Is **far stronger** than those with mere **strength**.

He who **knows contentment** is **rich**—
If one is **content with a single gourd**,
Then he is **rich beyond all realms**.
He who **pursues strength** has **aspiration**—
To **begin and complete** matters **unwaveringly**
Is to have **aspiration and integrity**.
He who **does not lose his place** endures **long**—
Yet **without constancy**,
He cannot **long endure his Dao**.

He who **dies yet does not perish** is **long-lived**—
If a man **practices Dao** to **benefit the world**,
The **laws and institutions** he **leaves behind**
Emerge from **divine insight and wisdom**,
Once **established**, they **last eternally**—
This is **his body decaying** yet **his spirit enduring**,
Thus he is **long-lived**.

The **Great Dao** is **vast and boundless**—
It is **not confined to one side**,
Yet I say it is **left or right**—
This is **briefly illustrating two extremes**,
To **make clear** the **completeness of all things**.
All **things depend on it** to **flourish**,
Yet it **does not refuse**—
When **nurturing all things** is complete,
It **does not claim ownership**.
It **loves and nourishes** all **things** yet **does not rule** them.
To **rule** would be **not forgetting its deeds**.

**Always without desire**,
It can be **named small**—
The **desireless** of the world
Are **innocent children**.
But **Dao** in **things** has **no desire**,
Is it **as small as innocent children**?
All **things return** to it yet it **does not rule**—
Is it **as great as this**,
Yet **unconcerned with things**?

Thus, the **sage** never **claims greatness**—
The **sage** follows **Dao**,
And **follows the small**,
Not **following the great**,
For fear of **losing humility**.
Thus he **can achieve the greatest**.
Without the **heart to claim greatness**,
His **deeds become vast and enduring**.
Holding the **great image (大象)**—
The world **comes toward** it—
*The great image*, meaning **Dao**.
No **thing** exists that **does not**,
Through **Dao**, take **form and substance**—
If he **holds this Dao** to **face the world**,
The people **will not fail to come toward** it.

**Coming toward** yet **doing no harm**,
**Peace and ease prevail**.
Once they **have come toward** it,
They **must be settled**—
Not in **order and tranquility** alone,
But in **harmonious ease and repose**—
**Joy and bait**,
For **passing travelers** to **rest**.

**Music is melody.**
**Bait is sustenance.**
What man desires—music and food—
Who, passing by, would not pause to rest?
**Dao**, when spoken, is bland, without taste.
Yet travelers linger because of sights to see,
And food to fill their bellies.
If this **great image (Dao)** were to emerge from the mouth,
To teach the people—bland, without savor—
How could one make them yearn for it?

Moreover, human nature is prone to excess,
Yet craves **non-action**.
**Dao** itself is **non-action**—
Thus men desire it.
To gaze upon it is insufficient to perceive its form,
To listen is insufficient to hear its sound,
Yet to employ it is inexhaustible.
*Inexhaustible*—meaning complete.
Though sight and hearing fail to grasp its shape and voice,
If one uses it, its power is boundless.
**To contract it**, one must first expand it;
**To weaken it**, one must first strengthen it;
**To discard it**, one must first establish it;
**To take it away**, one must first bestow it.
This is called **subtle clarity**.

These four principles—
At their nascent stage, may be called **subtle**,
Yet they can solidify the source
And sever the sprouts before they rise.

**Softness overcomes hardness**—
For what begins as frail and weak
Eventually flourishes into strength and vigor.
If one seeks to remove it in its tender state,
Victory is assured over its hardened form.

**Fish cannot be caught from the depths**—
If the fish slips from the hand and plunges into the deep,
It cannot be controlled.
**A nation’s sharpest tools**
Should not be displayed to the people.
*Sharp tools*—meaning **strategic schemes**.
When matters are in their embryonic stage,
They can be guided—
Not allowed to reach full strength.
This is the true principle for governing self and state,
And must never be revealed to the unworthy.
If such schemes fall into the hands of the unprincipled,
What difference is there from the fish slipping into the deep?

**Dao** acts without action,
Yet nothing remains undone.
It acts without intention—
Thus it accomplishes all things.

If lords and kings could uphold it,
All things would transform of their own accord.
If **non-action** is not abandoned,
Then nothing remains untransformed.
When transformation stirs,
I shall govern it with the **Uncarved Block of the Nameless**.
*The Uncarved Block of the Nameless*—
The foundation of **non-action**.
**Non-action** leaves no trace—
What name could it bear?
If the ruler holds this to govern the people,
Who would dare move recklessly?
The **Uncarved Block of the Nameless** also
Shall not desire.
When the mind of guarding **Dao** is forgotten,
One aligns with the original simplicity of nature.
**Non-desire**, through stillness,
And the world will self-correct.
He who seeks stillness with intent
Will never attain it.
Now, set free into natural ease,
With nothing in the breast—
Then ruler and subject, high and low,
Each return to their true nature.

「Li Yue’s Annotation: *Dao De Jing*, Upper Section

**Chapter Forty-One:**

The **virtue/power** of the Highest **Dao/Way** does not cling to **virtue/power**,
Yet men do not see its trace—
Then they call it *not* **virtue/power**.

Thus, it is indeed **virtue/power**:
Things do not alter their **Uncarved Block**—
Only then does one know it as **virtue/power**.

The **virtue/power** of the Lowest **Dao/Way** does not abandon **virtue/power**,
Admiring the beauty of former kings,
Reverently guarding it without decline.
Thus, it is *not* **virtue/power**.

When the nature of things slightly shifts,
One knows it as *not* **virtue/power**.

The **virtue/power** of the Highest **Dao/Way** acts without action yet nothing is left undone,
Does without doing yet achieves.
The **virtue/power** of the Lowest **Dao/Way** acts with doing yet leaves nothing undone,
Does with doing yet achieves.

The **virtue/power** of the Highest Benevolence
Begins by transforming **Dao/Way** into benevolence,
Yet nothing is left undone—
Though it acts, its mind remains undisturbed.

The **virtue/power** of the Highest Righteousness
Begins by transforming **Dao/Way** into righteousness,
Yet leaves nothing undone—
Focusing solely on judgment and restraint.

The **virtue/power** of the Highest Propriety
Begins by transforming **Dao/Way** into propriety,
Yet none respond—
Then they roll up their sleeves and force it upon them.
Gifts and replies are misplaced,
Thus arises this anger.
Hence, **virtue/power** is lost before **Dao/Way** is lost—
The Highest **Dao/Way** aligns with **Dao/Way**, hence the saying *loses **Dao/Way***.
The **virtue/power** of the Lowest **Dao/Way** follows next,
This is why there is **virtue/power**, benevolence, righteousness, and propriety.
Having lost the Highest **virtue/power**,
The Lowest **virtue/power** takes its place.

**Virtue/power** is lost before benevolence—
The Lowest **virtue/power** has its flaws,
Thus teachings of benevolence arise.
Benevolence is lost before righteousness—
Teachings of benevolence decline,
Thus righteousness prevails.
Righteousness is lost before propriety—
Right and wrong, fitting and improper,
Already fading in time,
Bow and kneel, jade and silk,
Flourish in the world.
For propriety is but the thinnest veneer of loyalty and trust,
And the beginning of chaos.
Chaos is when rulers are not rulers,
Subjects are not subjects,
Fathers are not fathers,
Sons are not sons.
Loyalty and trust are **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**.
If propriety is compared to **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,
It is indeed decayed and thin.
Yet to save from chaos,
Where else would one turn but propriety?
Those who foresaw this knew that propriety would please the eyes of the people—
This is called the *flower of **Dao/Way***.
In ancient times, *flower* was written; now *ornament* is used instead.
Yet it is the beginning of foolishness.
If it is suitable for the foolish,
It is the first sign of extravagance.
Thus, a true **man of **Dao/Way****—
A **man of **Dao/Way**** is one of strong character.
The strong character of a **man of **Dao/Way****
Must be square and upright, not yielding to superficial trends,
Hence the *Changyan* says:
*A true **man of **Dao/Way****, must practice **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,
Not indulge in superficial propriety.*
Dwelling in its depth, not in its shallowness,
He must commit himself to **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,
Not place himself in decayed thinness.
Residing in substance, not in ornament—
Substance like the fruit of grass and trees,
Filling the stomach of men,
Thus it is dwelt upon.
Ornament like the flowers of grass and trees,
Merely pleasing to the eye,
Thus it is not dwelt upon.
Hence, he discards that and takes this—
Discarding ornament, taking substance.
The *ancient ones who attained **Oneness*** are found in the lower text.

Heaven attains **Oneness** and finds clarity,
Earth attains **Oneness** and finds tranquility,
The valleys attain **Oneness** and fill,
The **spirit** attains **Oneness** and becomes luminous,
All things attain **Oneness** and live,
Noble kings attain **Oneness** to rule the world with rectitude.
From Heaven and Earth descending to noble kings,
What enables them to be clear and tranquil,
Is attaining **Oneness** from **Dao/Way**,
Hence the noble kings rectify themselves to rectify the people,
Thus the world is ruled with rectitude.
*Rectitude* means *correctness*.
Their attainment is as follows:
Having known **Dao/Way**,
Their attainment is thus—
How could they lose it?

Heaven without clarity would fear collapse,
Earth without tranquility would fear upheaval,
The valleys without fullness would fear exhaustion,
The **spirit** without luminosity would fear cessation,
All things without life would fear annihilation,
Noble kings without nobility would fear decline.
*Cessation* means *overturned*.
If one attains it yet does not guard it,
Thus arise these calamities.

Hence, nobility takes humility as its foundation,
Kings are noble, the people are humble,
Kings take the people as their foundation,
Thus there are people, there are kings.
Highness takes lowliness as its base.
A mountain nine *zhang* high,
A single basketful as its base—
If the base is not firm,
The mountain will topple.
To preserve nobility,
Not resting securely upon the people,
Then the people scatter and the kings decline.
Thus, noble kings call themselves *lonely, childless, without grain*—
Is this not taking humility as their foundation?
No, it is not.
*Lonely* means *child without father*,
*Childless* means *woman without husband*,
*Without grain* means *life without sustenance*.
These three are what men detest,
Yet noble kings claim them—
Is this not taking humility as their foundation?
No, it is not—
It is saying that correctness is taking humility as the foundation.

Hence, when attaining the **Dao/Way** of a chariot,
One seeks the **Dao/Way** of a chariot—
Only the wheels and axles and all the materials are obtained.
Then, when attaining the **Dao/Way** of a king,
One seeks the **Dao/Way** of a king—
Only the ministers and the common people are obtained.
If one scatters the materials,
There will be no day of making a chariot;
If one does not rest securely upon the people,
How could there be a time for ruling as a king?

Do not desire to be smooth and polished like jade,
Nor rough and unrefined like stone.
*Smooth and polished* is the appearance of nobility,
*Rough and unrefined* is the appearance of humility.
Though jade is noble,
It grows from stone;
Though kings are exalted,
They depend upon the people.
Thus, not desiring to be like jade,
Desiring to be like stone,
Is to cherish the foundation.
*Reversion* is the movement of **Dao/Way**,
**Dao/Way**’s essence is stillness—
Movement is reversion,
The reason for reversion is the rigid nature of things,
Hence setting forth the rigid to meet it,
Also hoping to reverse its stillness.

Softness is the application of **Dao/Way**.
The soft and weak are the constant use of **Dao/Way**.
All things know this,
Yet it is made clear again—
For fear that, due to the meaning of *setting forth the rigid*,
One would say that the application of **Dao/Way** is naturally so.

All things under Heaven are born from *having*,
All things are born from the forms of Heaven and Earth.
*Having* is born from *non-having*.
That is, the forms of Heaven and Earth are born from **Dao/Way**.
**Dao/Way** is *non-having*.

The Superior **man of **Dao/Way**** hears **Dao/Way**,
Diligently practices it;
Hearing it and understanding,
He diligently practices and returns to the foundation.

The Middle **man of **Dao/Way**** hears **Dao/Way**,
As if it exists, as if it does not;
Hearing it and doubting,
It is still teachable—
To make him know **Dao/Way**.

The Inferior **man of **Dao/Way**** hears **Dao/Way**,
And laughs greatly—
Hearing it and being confused,
Thus he laughs greatly,
Then one cannot make him white as snow.»

The **Dao/Way** is not to be taken lightly—
For when it enters the ears of the Inferior **man of Dao/Way** as mere sound,
It is not worthy of esteem.

Let me establish this teaching:
*"Establish"* means to clarify.
Clarify the doubts of the Middle and Inferior **men of Dao/Way**,
Why they laugh in derision.

The **Dao/Way** is bright yet hidden in practice,
Illuminated in deed yet concealed in application.
Advancing the **Dao/Way** seems like retreat—
Within, diligent; without, appearing idle.
Making the **Dao/Way** plain seems like disorder—
Like uneven silk, rough to the touch.
Treading the level ground as if on perilous heights.
**Virtue/power** most exalted resembles a valley—
Without contrivance, yet responsive in all things.
Great whiteness seems like shame—
Pure in nature, yet stained in appearance.
Ample **virtue/power** appears insufficient—
The **Dao/Way** does not manifest in form.
Established **virtue/power** seems like theft—
Talent concealed, not displayed.
True substance seems corrupted—
The most absolute becomes like excess.
The greatest square has no corners—
No edges or valleys are visible.
Great vessels take long to form—
Not sought daily and obtained.
Great music is without sound—
*"Hesitant"* means *nonexistent*.
Without sound, yet joyous.
Great images are formless—
The form of the formless.

From *"Establish this teaching"* onward,
All speak of the **Dao/Way** hidden in the nameless.
Thus, the Superior **man of Dao/Way** penetrates and practices with diligence,
The Middle **man of Dao/Way** doubts and hesitates,
The Inferior **man of Dao/Way** is confused and laughs—
Now you know the reason.

Only the **Dao/Way** is good at lending and completing.
The **Dao/Way** does not discriminate among the three **men of Dao/Way**,
But uniformly lends its harmonizing *qi*—
All things grow and are completed.
Yet those who practice diligently alone return to harmony with the **Dao/Way**,
While those who doubt and laugh both perish in the original *qi*.

The **Dao/Way** generates *Oneness*—
That is, it responds to stimuli and generates *One qi*.
*One* generates *Two*—
*One* first generates *yin qi*,
*Two* first generates *yang qi*.
*Two* generates *Three*—
*Three* is when *yin* and *yang* interact and generate harmonizing *qi*.
*Three* generates all things—
Harmonizing *qi* gathers and gives birth to all things.
All things carry *yin* externally and embrace *yang* internally,
Their clashing *qi* harmonizes.
Generally, the outer skin and texture are called *"carrying yin."*
Skin and texture are the work of *yin qi*.
The marrow and bones, filled within, are called *"embracing yang."*
Bone structure is the work of *yang qi*.
The **Dao/Way**’s *qi* is soft and weak,
Penetrating and harmonizing between them.

What people detest are the *Three Loneliness*—
The solitary, the widowed, the childless—
Yet kings and nobles take them as titles.
The kings and nobles’ harmonizing *qi* is soft and weak,
The root of all things,
Thus they can use what is unlucky as their title,
And so become rulers of the world.
Thus, some things are diminished yet benefit—
Calling it unlucky is truly self-diminishment,
For how could anything not submit?
Or benefit yet be diminished—
Those who rely on their noble status
Are themselves the benefactors,
Yet the people’s hearts turn away—
What else but loss could it be?

What people teach is also my teaching.
If one desires to establish teaching for others,
They must also teach with the principle of softness and weakness,
Then those who embrace it will all return to the city of nature and life.

The strong and violent do not meet a good end.
When a ruler is strong and tyrannical,
His ministers’ loyalty wanes, and ruin is imminent.
When a person is strong and violent,
They are overthrown by the many—
Their downfall is inevitable.
I will make this my teaching’s foundation.
*"Foundation"* means what comes first.
I make the principle of softness and weakness
The first teaching for the people.

The most soft under Heaven
Overcomes the most hard under Heaven.
For harmonizing *qi* is the most soft thing under Heaven.
If one rides it,
It transforms into the most hard thing under Heaven.
There is nothing that enters the unbroken—
If one wishes to restore harmonizing *qi* to its softness,
Simply abandon the intent to ride it,
Clarify the mind that harmonizing *qi* naturally enters the unbroken,
And it transforms into the most soft thing.

Thus I know the benefits of *wuwei*.
Laozi said:
*"I see those who ride *wuwei*—
They can make harmonizing *qi* dwell eternally in the heart,
Soft and weak, yet long-lived—
Thus I know *wuwei* benefits people."*

The teaching of silence,
The benefits of *wuwei*—
Few under Heaven can attain them.
To not speak to others,
To practice *wuwei* oneself—
Few under Heaven can do this.

Which is closer: name or body?
Name can be discarded, but body cannot—
Then which is more distant?
Which is more abundant: body or wealth?
Wealth lost can be sought, but life lost cannot be regained—
Then which is scarcer?
Which is more harmful: gain or loss?
Gain leads to losing the body,
Loss preserves the true self—
Then which is truly advantageous?

Thus excessive love brings great expenditure—
Desire beyond measure means great loss.
Hoarding leads to great ruin.
Accumulating without dispersing,
Nineteen out of twenty will die.
Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace—
Sufficiency in the heart brings constant honor.
Knowing when to stop brings no peril—
Stopping at one’s measure brings constant peace.
This is how one endures long.

Great completion resembles deficiency—
Those with full **virtue/power** appear lacking.
Their use is unexhausted.
Their response to things is boundless.

Great fullness resembles emptiness—
Those internally real appear externally void.
Their use is inexhaustible.
Even in aiding the multitude, they are never depleted.

Great straightness resembles bending—
They endure filth without complaint.
Great skill resembles clumsiness—
They do not boast of their abilities.
Great eloquence resembles stammering—
Seeming unable to speak.

The restless overcomes the cold—
Things at their extreme reverse—
Thus at the summer solstice, *yin* begins to arise within it.
The tranquil overcomes the heat—
Misfortune at its peak becomes fortune—
Thus at the winter solstice, *yang* begins to arise within it.

Calmness and stillness are the norm for the world.
*"Norm"* means the balance between restlessness and tranquility—
Thus the second and eighth months.
Hence, from *"Great completion"* onward to *"Great eloquence,"*
All conform to the balance between restlessness and tranquility,
Attaining the world’s norm.

When the world follows the **Dao/Way**,
Warhorses are driven back to manure fields.
A **Dao/Way**-governed ruler succeeds a mediocre one,
And must rectify chaos and restore order,
Abandoning arms and cultivating culture—
Thus the warhorses formerly used in conquest
Are now unused and returned to their homes
To till the fields.

When the world lacks the **Dao/Way**,
Warhorses breed in the suburbs.
A ruler without the **Dao/Way** follows a peaceful era,
Relying on abundant treasuries,
And grows fond of warfare,
Seizing others’ lands—
Thus soldiers never dismount,
Ever stationed at the borders.

「Guilt is none greater than craving what is not right,
Within the pursuit of things, there are yet its limits.
Misfortune is none greater than not knowing contentment—
What lies before one’s eyes, one must not abandon.
Blame is none more severe than desiring to obtain.
Whether seen or unseen, all must be sought,
Then nothing in the world remains untaken—
These are the deeds of rulers without the **Dao/Way**.

Thus, the contentment of *knowing contentment*,
Knowing to stop at contentment,
Then earthen steps and thatched roofs
Are not yet deemed insufficient—
Ever content, one does not overstep one’s portion.
To cherish peace among the people,
This is the ruler with the **Dao/Way**.

Not stepping outside one’s door, yet knowing the world—
By measuring it with oneself, the world may be understood.
Not peering through the window, yet seeing the **Dao/Way**—
To act in accordance with Heaven, one need not peer through windows.
The farther one ventures, the less one knows.
The people’s peace lies in the absence of strife,
Yet one contrives strife to bring them peace—
Then strife grows ever more distant,
And the people’s peace ever more scarce.

Hence, the sage acts without knowing,
Knowing that the people’s peace rests in their own tranquility—
If there is no strife, the people are at peace,
No need to act upon the world.

The sage does not see yet names,
Guarding the **Dao/Way** in office—
Then the grand steps of governance naturally level,
Why await peering through windows to discern clarity?

The sage does not act yet accomplishes.
To perfect this supreme principle,
One must do nothing.
Had one acted otherwise,
This result would never have come to pass.

To study is to grow daily,
But those who study grow ever more aware.
To cultivate the **Dao/Way** is to diminish daily.
Those who cultivate the **Dao/Way** diminish their actions day by day.
Diminish again and again—
One diminishment is yet shallow,
Two diminishments, then deep.
Until one reaches *non-action*.
Diminish until there is no diminishment,
Then one wanders in the *Huan Zhong* [1].

Without action yet without failing to act—
To complete great deeds without taking credit is *non-action*.
To give rise to all things is without failing to act.
To take the world, one must first ensure its peace—
Peace means *non-action* does not go against the people’s will,
Nor does it take what benefits oneself alone.
If one takes what benefits oneself alone, it troubles the people,
And when the people are troubled, they scatter and disperse—
How then can one take the world?

The sage has no fixed heart,
Like a hollow boat drifting freely upon the waters.
He takes the hearts of the people as his own.
What the people delight in, the sage brings to fruition,
Not contradicting their nature.
Even what is not good, the sage transforms into good,
Through the power of virtue—
He never forces others to submit to his own will.

The trustworthy, I trust them,
Not thwarting their resolve.
The untrustworthy, I also trust them,
Through the power of virtue.
The sage extends sincerity to the world,
And the people naturally transform into trustworthiness—
Not by decree, but by their own accord.

The sage dwells in the world,
Ever mindful—
The sage, dwelling in the world,
Ever bears in mind the burdens of the people,
Lest any single thing bring them distress.
He blends his heart with the people’s desires.
The people all focus their ears and eyes,
All straining their ears and eyes,
To observe and listen whether the sage follows their desires.
The sage treats them as infants—
In thought and deed, he nurtures them as tender children,
Never bearing to disturb them with strife.

Life and death arise from the heart’s deceit—
Deceit in the heart gives rise to life,
While truth brings death.
Those who cling to life number thirteen,
Those who cling to death number thirteen.
Within, the five **zang** organs [2],
Without, the eight **fu** organs [3],
Eyes, ears, nose, mouth, hands, feet, and the three **lù** afflictions [4]—
Together, they lead all people to their deaths.

The eight **fu** organs race outward,
The five **zang** organs receive inward,
Both conspire to drag people to their deaths.
If one ensures peace—
Each cleanses its own domain,
Then one brings people to full life.

Again it is said:
The five **zang** organs, five **xíng** forms [5], and three **dàn** fields [6] make thirteen.
The head and the four limbs are the five **xíng** forms.
The three **dàn** fields, as the *Huángtíng Jīng* [7] states:
The upper **dàn** field is the brain,
The middle **dàn** field lies between the heart and spleen,
The lower **dàn** field is the **qì** sea within the kidneys.
The thirteen paths that lead to life or death—
Those who seek life, ever restless,
All fall into the path of death,
Also through the thirteen that deceive them.»

---
[1] *Huan Zhong* (环中) – The "circular center" or "middle void," a Daoist concept of balance and harmony beyond extremes.
[2] *Zang* (五藏) – The five solid organs: heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys.
[3] *Fu* (八使) – The eight hollow organs: gallbladder, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, bladder, triple burner, lungs (shared with *zang*), and heart (shared with *zang*).
[4] *Lù* (三漏) – The "three leaks" or defilements: desire, aversion, and delusion.
[5] *Xíng* (五形) – The five physical forms: head, arms, legs, and torso.
[6] *Dàn* (三田) – The "three fields" or energy centers in Daoist physiology.
[7] *Huángtíng Jīng* (黄庭经) – A Daoist alchemical text, "Scripture of the Yellow Court."

Why is this so?
Asking the cause of falling into the realm of death.
It is because of the excess of life’s nourishment.
The reply: It is due to overindulgence in worldly things,
to overfeeding and overindulgence—
thus the thirteen [deceivers] find opportunity to kill.

It is said that those who excel in preserving life—
*preserving* meaning *nourishing*—
those who excel in nourishing life
restrain the thirteen within the realm of purity and stillness,
and abandon this body in the place of formlessness.

When walking on land, one does not encounter rhinoceros or tigers—
rhinoceros and tigers are fierce beasts,
capable of harming with claw and horn,
yet without the intent to harm others,
one avoids such encounters.

Entering battlefields, one is not struck by weapons or armor—
weapons can maim, armor can defend,
yet without the will to fight,
one does not need to bear such implements.

The rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,
the tiger no place to strike with its claw,
the blade no place to find its edge.
If one’s heart is fixed on harming others,
even the smallest insect—
a wasp or hornet—
cannot fail to sting,
much less tigers and rhinoceros!

If one harbors no intent to harm,
even when confronted by fierce beasts or sharp weapons,
how could they harm you?

It is further said:
Rhinoceros, tigers, weapons, and armor
are likened to the evils within the body—
to say that in purity and non-action,
calamity has no cause to enter,
and sickness no means to arise.

Why is this so?
Asking the reason for avoiding death.

The place where death cannot enter is because of its non-existence.

The thirteen cohorts are repelled by purity and non-action,
preventing the Five Evils and Three Corpses from entering the heart.
Thus, there is no place for death to take root.

If one loses purity even by a hair’s breadth,
the Five Evils and Three Corpses seize the opportunity to advance,
and their horns, claws, and blades find purchase.

The Way gives birth to it—
the initial loan of *qi*.
Virtue nurtures it—
the gradual containment and sustenance.
Things shape it—
the substance and form take full form.
Circumstance completes it—
the four seasons cycle, and things transform accordingly.
Thus, all things do not fail to revere the Way and honor virtue.

Even the most foolish creature knows not to dishonor its parents and fails to revere them.
The Way’s exaltation, virtue’s nobility—
none bestow them, yet they arise naturally.

What mortals revere and honor are those who receive imperial mandate.
But the Way and virtue require no such conferral;
they possess the inherent function of generation,
and thus are revered and honored by all things.

Therefore, the Way gives birth, nurtures, lengthens, and matures it,
completes and ripens it, nourishes and shelters it.
With such power, it needs no titles or commands.

It gives birth yet does not possess—
possession would exhaust its benevolence.
It acts yet does not rely—
reliance would claim its merit.
This is called the Mysterious Virtue.
It may be called Hidden Benevolence.

The world has a beginning—
the beginning is the root,
the source from which all things derive their birth.
It is the Mother of the world.
The Mother is nourishment,
the means by which all things achieve completion.
Having known the Mother, one knows the child;
knowing the Way as Mother, the child is clearly the things.
Having known the child, one returns to guard the Mother—
knowing the child arises from birth,
one knows to guard the Mother to preserve the child.
Thus, one avoids peril to the end of life.
The Way upholds it—
what danger could there be?

Seal the *yue* orifice;
close the eyes to idle speech.
Shut the gate;
seal the mouth that speaks much.
Thus, one lives a life without toil,
and the form rests while the spirit reigns supreme.

Open the *yue* orifice, aid its affairs—
the people’s desires are already excessive;
with the Way to guard the gaps, one still fears their excess—
how much more so if one aids and indulges them?
Thus, one lives a life without salvation.
When calamity has already taken form,
it cannot be rectified or rescued.

Seeing the small is clarity—
when form is shaped, enlightenment follows.
Guarding softness is strength—
the accumulation of weakness leads to this.
Using its radiance, one returns to its clarity.
Observing the law of guarding the Mother to preserve the child,
one attains the law and collects vision to guard the center.
Seeing the small, guarding the soft—
this is the law.
Without inviting bodily harm,
one avoids self-inflicted calamity.
This is called *xi chang*—
the hidden path to eternal life.

If I, a solitary and upright man, were to act in the Great Way,
solitary and unyielding—
if I were to see the division of the world,
I would make the straight path prevail throughout the world.
Only the upright dare fear—
only the solitary uphold rectitude—
how could they fear the multitude of evils?

The Great Way is most level,
the genuine path for rulers and subjects alike.
Yet people prefer shortcuts.
In their time, they favor crooked ways,
and I, though light in power, cannot restrain them.

The court is grandly adorned—
excessive ornamentation.
The fields lie fallow—
seizing the people’s time.
The granaries are empty—
the people lack food.
Fine silks and embroideries—
the ruler’s wealth is abundant.
Wearing sharp swords—
a fondness for martial display.
Silent in feasting—
squandering precious delicacies.
Abundant wealth—
obtained through greedy accumulation.
This is called *thieving glory*—
unrighteous gain—
what is it if not theft?
Yet they show no shame,
only more boastfulness.
How can this be the Way?

Ah, indeed!
Thievery is already not the Way—
how much more so when they further pride themselves?
Truly such people are worthy of lamentation.

Those who build well cannot be toppled—
those who build a nation or establish themselves must do so with virtue.
With virtue, one’s person is secure and the nation unshaken.

Those who embrace well cannot be lost—
*lost* means failure.
The builder of a nation embraces the people,
the establisher of oneself embraces the spirit.
If both are done with virtue,
there will be no failure or loss.

Their descendants will sacrifice at the *qi* tree without ceasing.
Those who build a nation and embrace the people with virtue
will have thriving descendants,
sacrificing at the *qi* tree without interruption.

Cultivate it in the person—
its virtue becomes genuine;
cultivate virtue in the person,
and all falseness is exhausted.

Cultivate it in the family—
its virtue becomes abundant;
cultivate virtue in the family,
and blessings flow to future generations.

Cultivate it in the village—
its virtue becomes enduring;
cultivate virtue in the village,
and its influence grows ever wider.

Cultivate it in the nation—
its virtue becomes plentiful;
cultivate virtue in the nation,
and ruler and people flourish.

Cultivate it in the world—
its virtue becomes universal.
Cultivate virtue throughout the world,
and even common households may be ennobled,
with transformation reaching distant lands—
thus, they climb mountains and cross seas to pay homage.

Therefore, observe the person to understand the person,
observe the family to understand the family,
observe the village to understand the village,
observe the nation to understand the nation,
observe the world to understand the world.
But by comparing these observations,
the rise and fall become visible.

How do I know the world is thus?
From these matters—
this is how one knows.

The depth of virtue is like that of an infant.

Those who harbor profound virtue,
their nature and form are both like an infant.
The infant, at its birth,
has a red hue—hence the name.

Venomous creatures do not sting,
venomous creatures being bees and wasps,
striking with their tail-tips to inflict venom—this is called "sting."
Fierce beasts do not clutch,
fierce beasts being tigers and leopards,
striking with their claws to seize—this is called "clutch."
**Playn** birds do not strike.

Men of virtue,
abandon all attachments and preserve their **spirit** (*shén*),
thus naturally evading the three dangers above.
It is further said:
The three dangers are like the **acquisitive and perverse poisons** (*tān yé dú hài*) within the body—
if one’s virtue is as pure as an infant’s,
then acquisitive and perverse poisons cannot harm them.

Their bones are frail, their sinews soft,
yet their grip is firm—
this is the **power of the will** (*zhuányì zhī jiān*).
They do not yet know the union of male and female,
yet their movements are complete—
this is **vital essence** (*jīng*) at its peak.
They do not yet recognize the meeting of male and female,
yet their **yin** is always strong—
this is **fullness of essence** (*jīng quán*).
They cry all day, yet their voice does not falter—
this is **harmony** (*hé*) at its utmost.
Though they weep continuously,
their voice never weakens—
this is the extreme of harmony.

Harmony is called **constancy** (*cháng*).
Infants possess these three abilities,
for harmony is at its peak in them.
Men of virtue know this,
thus they always preserve it.
Constancy is called **clarity** (*míng*).
Those who know constancy can be called **clear**.

To grow further is called **auspiciousness** (*xiáng*).
To add even the slightest deviation to nature,
this transforms the **auspicious** into the **inauspicious** (*xiáng wéi xiāng*).
The heart commands the **qi**—this is called **strength** (*qiáng*).
Harmonious **qi** is supremely soft,
yet when the heart grows angry,
it becomes strong.

When things are at their peak, they grow old—
strength is the precursor to aging.
This is called **not the Dao/Way** (*bù dào*).
If one cannot return to youth from old age,
then they must lack the **Dao of complete harmony** (*quán hé zhī dào*).
**Not the Dao** is early decay.
Commanding them to stop yet they do not—
this is the way of the **wise**.

The **wise** do not speak—
those who forget speech,
their wisdom is at its height.
Those who speak are not **wise**—
the unwise, thus, are hindered by speech.

Close their **mouth** (*yuè*).
Do not gaze with their eyes.
Shut their **gate** (*mén*).
Do not utter with their lips.
Dull their sharpness—
this is to **break their will** (*cuì zhī zhì*).
Resolve their confusion—
this is to **empty their minds** (*xū zhī xīn*).
Harmonize their brightness—
when the time is bright, they are bright.
Blend with the dust—
when the time is dark, they are dark.
This is called **mysterious unity** (*xuán tóng*).
Unity without distinction.
Thus, they cannot be approached with familiarity—
**ren** is unseen.
They cannot be distanced—
their traces are unstained.
They cannot be exploited—
their goodness transcends material things.
They cannot be harmed—
they do not covet bait.
They cannot be despised—
they embrace **Dao** and **virtue**.
Thus, they are noble throughout the world.

When a man reaches this state,
only then can he be the **Dao supreme** (*zhìdào*) for the world.
To govern the state with **political measures** (*zhèng*).
To use **teachings and commands** (*jiào lìng*).
To employ the **unexpected** (*qí*) in warfare,
to value **deceitful stratagems** (*zhà jì*)—
these are the ways of the **two inferior children** (*èr zǐ*).
To take the world with **no action** (*wúshì*).

Only those who take **no action** can win the hearts of the world,
and thus ascend as **Emperor** and **King**—
how can this be compared with the **two inferior children** in their governance?

How do I know the world is thus?
From these matters—
this is how one knows.
I know that governing with **political measures** and employing the **unexpected** are insufficient to take the world,
only those who take **no action** can win the hearts of the world and rule over them—
this is known from the following text.

The world abounds in **taboos** (*jìhuì*),
yet the people grow ever poorer—
this is the **ruler** who governs with **political measures**,
whose prohibitions and commands are dense and intricate,
so the people fear transgression,
daring not to act—
thus, they grow ever poorer each day.

The people multiply **sharp implements** (*lìqì*),
and the state grows ever more **corrupt** (*hūn*).
The people all fear death,
thus they must rely on **weapons** (*gōng shǐ yǐng shǐ*) to guard their lives,
so the state grows ever more **chaotic and disordered**.

The people abound in **crafty skills** (*jìqiǎo*),
and **strange artifacts** arise—
this is the **ruler** who employs the **unexpected**,
whose ambition lies in warfare,
who earnestly loves deceit and the **unexpected**,
and who also cherishes **offensive and defensive tools**—
thus, the people must all use their **cleverness** (*rèn zhì*) and **deceit** (*zhà*) to indulge in **strange artifacts**.

**Laws and prohibitions** grow ever more **prominent** (*zī zhāng*),
and **thieves and bandits** multiply—
**Laws and artifacts** are the **crafty skills** of men,
created beyond ordinary emotions,
yet they demand **exalted virtue** (*shàn fèn*).
Thus, many secretly **plunder their forms** (*qiè zhī fǎshì*)
and **steal their goods** (*dào zhī cáiwù*),
arising from the **fault** of emphasizing **artifacts**.

Therefore, the **Sage** says:
*"I take no action, yet the people transform themselves.
I merely stand in silence, yet the people all transform.
I love stillness, yet the people align themselves.
I but maintain my own stillness, yet the people all transform—
they do not turn to **evil** (*yé*).
I take no action, yet the people grow rich.
I but take no action, and the people do not lose their **livelihood** (*shī yè*),
so they naturally grow rich.
I have no desires, yet the people remain **simple** (*pǔ*).
I but have no desires, yet the people naturally **revere their roots** (*zōng běn*).
His governance is **obscured and indistinct** (*mèn mèn*).
The **ruler** does not create **affairs** (*shì*) to disturb the people,
appearing as if **obscured** and unable to act.
His people are **pure and sincere** (*chún chún*).
The people dwell in **tranquility** (*qīngjìng*),
thus their **sincerity and thickness** (*dūn hòu*) grow daily.
His governance is **piercing and scrutinizing** (*chá chá*).
The **ruler’s** policies are strict,
and the people have no room to move their **hands and feet** (*shǒuzú*).
They **dare not act** (*dòng zé chū gāng*).
Thus, they fear and avoid—
from this, they grow ever more **withered and exhausted** (*tiāo cán*).

Calamity (*huò*), indeed,
is where **auspiciousness** (*fú*) leans upon—
leaning, meaning **relying** (*yǐ*).
The **clever and insightful ruler** (*cōngmíng zhī jūn*)
reflects upon himself and cultivates **virtue** (*xiū dé*),
transforming from **withered and exhausted** to **pure and harmonious** (*chún hé*).

**Auspiciousness** (*fú*), indeed,
is where calamity (*huò*) lies hidden—
hidden, meaning **concealed** (*fù*).
The **reckless and benighted ruler** (*yōng hūn zhī zhǔ*)
takes **pure and harmonious** as his own **virtue** (*dé*),
thus he **oppresses the law** (*nuè fǎ*),
transforming from **pure and harmonious** back to **withered and exhausted**.

Who knows their limits?
Like **twisted ropes** (*jiǔ chán*)."

「Is there no true standard?
Calamity and auspiciousness rely and conceal—
how could there be no true standard?
There must be a true standard indeed,
found in the **ruler who follows the Dao** (*yǒu dào zhī jūn*).

The true standard becomes the extraordinary,
the good becomes the sinister.
The confusion of men is long-standing.

To take the true standard as deceit,
to regard goodness as folly—
this is the common delusion of those who are bewildered.

Men fall into this delusion
not in a single morning or evening—
its origins stretch far back.

Thus, the **Sage** (*shèng rén*)
is square yet does not cut,
upholding the true standard without reviling the perverse.

He is straight yet does not overreach,
not provoking others to notice him.

His light shines yet does not dazzle,
preserving it without ostentation.

He is frugal yet not filthy—
not judging others as unclean because of his own purity.

In governing men and serving **Heaven** (*tiān*),
nothing surpasses **frugality** (*sè*).
Frugality is **modesty** (*jiǎn*).

To govern men and win their hearts,
to serve Heaven and align with its **Dao** (*dào*—Way),
nothing equals **modesty in practice**.

Indeed, only through **frugality** (*sè*)
does one achieve **early submission** (*zǎo fú*).
Only those who can truly embody **modest virtue** (*jiǎn dé*)
will find all the people willingly submitting early.

**Early submission** is called **laying down deep layers of virtue** (*chóng jī dé*).
Modest virtue is the first layer,
early submission the second—
from the first to the second is called **laying down deep layers**.

When virtue is deeply layered,
there is nothing it cannot achieve.
Achieve, meaning **capable** (*néng*).

Layered virtue means there is nothing it cannot do.
If there is nothing it cannot do,
its limits are beyond knowing,
its power is beyond measure.

If its limits are beyond knowing,
it can establish a **state** (*guó*).
If virtue is beyond measure,
only then can one become a **ruler of the land** (*yǒu tǔ zhī jūn*).

A **state** (*guó*) with enduring foundation
can last long.
Enduring, meaning **nourishing** (*yǎng*).

A state with people,
if governed by the Dao and nourished,
then the **altars of earth and grain** (*shèjì*—sacrificial sites) and the **blessings of the ancestral spirits** (*fú zuò*)
can endure and grow long-lasting.

This is called the **Dao of deep-rooted stability and lasting vision** (*chángshēng jiǔshì zhī dào*).
Like cultivating trees,
if the roots are deepened, the trunk is firm—
even with great winds,
it cannot uproot the roots
or let its blossoms and fruit fall.

The words of **layered virtue** (*jī dé*)
are thus profound in their benefit to the state.

As for talk of **long life and enduring rule** (*chángshēng jiǔshì*),
it speaks of the **Sage establishing laws that transcend mortality** (*bù xiǔ*—immortality),
to bring forth endless blessings for the world,
not to preserve a form that obstructs life.

*Begins the New Commentary on the Authentic Daoist Classic, Volume Four*」

「Li Yue’s Annotation – *Dao Jing* Lower Section

To govern a great state, as one would cook a small fish.
If one cooks a small fish, letting it mature naturally, it remains whole;
disturb it, and it spoils.

A skilled ruler of the people lets them find their own way, and they are at peace;
disturb them, and they fall into chaos.

When the Dao reigns over the world,
its spirits lose their power.

Where the Dao’s transformation reaches,
the people suffer no calamities—
thus, its spirits seem without power.

It is not that the spirits lack power,
but that their power does not harm the people.
The spirits truly possess power,
and their power does not damage things.

Nor is it that their power does not harm the people—
the Sage also does not harm the people.

The Sage loves the people as a newborn child,
and the spirits likewise bring them blessings.

The living and the unseen both find their rightful place,
unhindered—
thus, virtue returns in harmony.

The ruler lacks no offerings to the spirits,
for the spirits can confer blessings upon him—
thus, it is said that his virtue returns in harmony.

A great state is the **lowly stream** (*xiàliú*), the gathering place of the world.
If it practices humility with moderation,
who would dare not submit?
Thus, states great and small come to pay homage.

The world’s gathering place is **feminine** (*pǔ*), ever victorious over the **masculine** (*mǔ*) through stillness.
The reason why the world’s states come to pay homage
is that they can dwell in the lowly stream.

As the feminine prevails over the masculine,
this is spoken of in terms of stillness and lowliness—
for none seek the masculine when they desire the feminine.

Stillness is lowliness.
Thus, the masculine seeks it.

Therefore, a great state that humbles itself beneath smaller states
will take them;
a great state that can humble itself
will find smaller states sincerely submitting.

A small state that humbles itself beneath a great state
will be taken by it;
a small state that can humble itself
will be received with courtesy by the great.

Thus, sometimes one humbles to take,
sometimes one humbles and is taken—
all have their reasons.

A great state seeks only to **encompass and nourish** (*jiānxù*) others;
the reason it humbles itself
is only to encompass and nourish smaller states,
making them tributaries,
and expand its lands.

A small state seeks only to **enter and serve** (*rùshì*) others.
The reason it humbles itself
is to enter and serve a great state,
so that other kingdoms dare not rise in arms against it.

Both achieve their desires,
fulfilling their ambitions—
thus, the great should humble itself.

A warning against the great
is that it might rely on strength rather than practice humility.

The Dao is the **ultimate mystery** (*ào*) of all things—
the Dao, among all things, is the deepest and most mysterious,
able to **be the foundation** (*gēnpǐn*) for the myriad creatures.

The treasure of the virtuous person,
the Dao of the virtuous person,
is that by **cultivating the self** (*xiūshēn*), one may attain **long life** (*chángshēng*).
Thus, it is called a treasure.

The refuge of the unvirtuous person.
The unvirtuous person—
this refers to the **lowly scholar** (*xiàshì*)—
has never sought the Dao.
When disaster strikes,
they cling to it as a desperate hope for protection.

Sweet words can be **bartered** (*shì*).
In trade,
those who can **delight in their speech** (*gān cí*)
find easy assembly when they go forth,
easy acquisition when they seek.

Noble conduct can **elevate others** (*jiārén*).
Those whose deeds are exalted
can first **teach and guide** (*jiào jiā*) others.

What is there to **abandon** (*qì*) in the unvirtuous?
No one is without virtue—
only that their transformation has not yet reached its fullness.

Thus, when establishing the **Son of Heaven** (*Tiānzǐ*) and appointing the **Three Exalted Ministers** (*sāngōng*),
the Son of Heaven is the **master of the myriad people** (*wànmín zhī zhǔ*).
He wishes to entrust them with his Dao,
so that they may transform the unvirtuous—
yet fears they might neglect his Dao.
Thus, he further appoints the Three Exalted Ministers to assist him.

Even with a **jewel-embossed tablet** (*gǒngbì*) and **fine steeds** (*liángmǎ*) presented before the carriage,
it is not as good as **simply presenting this Dao** (*zuòjìn zhī dào*).

The Three Exalted Ministers may offer a jewel-embossed tablet
and fine steeds before the carriage,
but this is merely the duty of loyal ministers.
Yet it is not as good as
**simply presenting this profound and mysterious Dao to the ruler** (*zuòjìn zhī shēn’ào zhī dào*)
to gather the **abundant and harmonious transformations** (*yōngxī zhī huà*).

Why did the ancients hold this in such esteem?
Because they wished to **reveal and clarify the marvels of the Dao** (*fā míng dào miào*).
Thus, this question was posed.»

The Sage asks, *"Why not seek it daily and obtain it?"*
The reply is: *"Because it cannot be sought daily and obtained in a day—
one must span generations, accumulate merit and practice over time,
and only then achieve it."*

**Shall one with completed virtue and perfected Dao be exempt from punishment?**
Even if he commits offenses against the ruler’s will—
like touching a dragon’s scales—
he shall be spared execution and blame.
*"Exempt"* is but an expression of praise.
Thus, he is held in highest esteem by all ages.

**Wuwei**—to act without action—
**sheng**—to nurture life within the heart—
**ze**—to follow patterns—
these disrupt the heart.

**Wuwu**—to act without pretense—
**shi**—to act from true intent—
**you**—to have affairs—
these cloud the will.

**Wuwei**—to taste without indulgence—
Those who savor flavors excessively
leave their palates parched.

**Great and small, much and little**—
Repay resentment with virtue.
Virtue is the highest of the three *"Wu"*s.
If a man practices these three virtues,
his heart shall be clear and bright.
A clear heart perceives resentment at its first stirrings—
if it arises from trifles and is cut off,
there shall be no great resentment;
if it arises from slight matters and is removed,
there shall be no excess.
Thus repaid, what resentment remains?
Resentment is the root of chaos, confusion, and depletion.

**Difficulties arise from ease**—
for what is small is easy.
**Greatness stems from the minute**—
for what is little is fine.

Great undertakings of the world must begin with ease,
and grand affairs must arise from the minute.
This is an inevitable principle.
The wise planner acts when omens first appear.

Thus, the Sage never pursues the grand;
he is most cautious at the outset.
Therefore, he achieves the great.

From this arises the Sage.

He who makes light of promises shall lack trustworthiness.
He who preserves sincerity
must weigh his words carefully.

What is easy in the beginning shall bring many difficulties.
Those who do not foresee the end
make every matter seem easy.
Thus, even the Sage finds it difficult,
for he is cautious at the start.
Therefore, there are no lasting difficulties.

What is hard at first becomes easy by the end.
What is stable is easy to uphold;
what is not yet manifest is easy to plan against.
Preventing it before it arises—
this is why it is easy.
What is brittle is easy to shatter,
so its beginnings are easy to disperse.
If removed at its first emergence,
it shall not become difficult.

Act before it exists;
govern before it is disordered.
This is the way of the wise and diligent.

A tree thick enough to embrace
grows from a slender shoot—
yet once grown, it cannot be uprooted.

A nine-tiered tower
begins with a single clod of earth—
yet once built, it cannot be concealed.

A thousand-li journey
begins with a single step—
yet once begun, it cannot be halted.

The doer brings about ruin.
The doer is the one who removes the seeds of calamity,
yet allows them to grow and mature—
thus it is called ruin.
Ruined things may still be restored.

The grasper loses.
The grasper, by nurturing evil and failing to refine,
ultimately leads to extinction—
thus it is called loss.
Lost things cannot be revived again.

The Sage acts not, hence knows no ruin.
Ruins arise from action—
what is not acted upon, how can it be ruined?
The Sage holds nothing, hence knows no loss.
Loss stems from grasping—
what is not grasped, how can it be lost?

The people’s undertakings
often fail just as they near completion,
for they have beginnings but no endings.
If one is as cautious at the end as at the start,
there will be no failed endeavors.
If the roots and ends remain unweakened,
nothing will fail to be accomplished.

Thus the Sage desires not what he desires not,
and does not prize hard-to-obtain treasures.
He desires what others do not desire,
so he regards gold and jade as discarded soil.

He teaches what is not taught,
to correct the common errors of the people,
and teaches what others do not learn,
so he can restrain the excesses of all living things.
He aids the natural unfolding of all things,
practicing these two courses
to assist all things in returning to their original nature.
He does not dare to act.
He guards and is cautious, so he does not dare to act recklessly.

The ancients who mastered the Dao
explained to those who knew the ancient Way,
wishing that the rulers of the present age would emulate them.
They did not enlighten the people openly,
for if they revealed the Dao to the people,
they feared it would inspire strange ambitions.
Instead, they sought to deceive them.
They subtly permeated them with the Dao,
so that they would return to their original simplicity.

The people are difficult to govern
because their cleverness is excessive.
When cunning is excessive, they harbor deceit and slander—
thus they are difficult to manage.
Therefore, governing with cleverness is the ruin of the state.
If those with excessive cleverness govern,
they will certainly implement corrupt policies,
and the people will be in chaos—
thus it is the ruin of the state.
Not governing with cleverness is the state’s blessing.
If one governs with sincerity and simplicity,
one will certainly practice non-action,
and the people will be at ease—
thus it is the state’s blessing.

These two principles are the models.
*Lǎi* (楷) is the pattern; *shì* (式) is the law.
One is ruin, the other is blessing.
These two are also very easy to discern—
knowing them, one should avoid harm and embrace benefit.

To always know the models is called *Xuán Dé* (玄德).
To always know that blessings can be embraced and ruin avoided,
and to bring the common people to great peace—
this is the ruler’s unfathomable virtue.

*Xuán Dé* is profound and distant,
contrary to the ways of things.
Its hidden virtue is deep and unknowable,
far and unsearchable.
Only thus can one restore all things to their natural state.
Then, all will return to their original purity,
and nothing will be out of harmony.

「The rivers and seas are able to be the sovereign of all the valleys because they excel in yielding.
Thus, they are able to be the sovereign of all the valleys.
*Sovereign* (王者) means *to go forth* (往也).
The rivers and seas excel in dwelling beneath the myriad streams,
and thus all the valleys converge and gather without fail.
Therefore, the sage is one who can emulate the rivers and seas.

To rise above others, one must first yield in speech;
To dwell above others, one must first yield in speech to them.
To surpass others, one must first place oneself behind them;
To dwell before others, one must retreat one’s own person behind them.

Thus, though in a position above, people do not feel burdened,
and all willingly revere and uphold him—
yet he is still considered light.
Though at the forefront, people are not harmed,
and all gladly follow without resentment or injury.
Thus, he delights in promoting and never tires.

This is the power of *humility*.
Because he does not contend, none under heaven can contend with him.
I use *humility* (谦德) to transform the people below,
and they, transformed, all become *retreat and yield* (退让).

All under heaven say, “His Dao is vast, yet he seems unworthy.”
All under heaven say, “His Dao is vast, yet he seems unvirtuous.”
Only because it is vast does it seem unworthy.
I tell them: the great person’s folly is beyond reach.
If *worthy* (肖) were long-lasting, how trifling it would be!
If *virtue* (贤) were to let others attain it,
this would be the most trifling of all under heaven for long.

I possess three treasures—
though I am unworthy, I have three practices,
which can be called the most precious of *cultivating the self and governing the state*.
*Treasure* (宝) and *hold* (持).
If people regard them as treasures and hold them without abandon,
then where can one go without benefit?
The first is *compassion* (慈), which is *benevolence* (仁).
The second is *frugality* (俭), which is *restraint* (约).
The third is *not daring to be first under heaven*—
dwelling behind all actions.

*Compassion* (慈) thus enables *courage* (勇);
*courage* to *rescue and aid* (济物).
*Frugality* (俭) thus enables *broadness* (广);
*restraint* (节用) thus yields this abundance.
Not daring to be first under heaven,
thus one achieves *longevity* (长).
*Self-effacement* (自下) leads to completion,
and *ascending to greatness* (升高) fulfills achievements—
thus one attains to be the sovereign of all under heaven.
*Emperor Yao* (尧) was the sovereign of the Nine Regions—this is the same.

Now, if one abandons *compassion* and yet has *courage*,
*courage* without *benevolence* will harm others.
If one abandons *frugality* and yet seeks *broadness*,
*excess* without restraint will surely appear.
If one abandons *yielding* and yet seeks to be first,
*placing oneself before others* (先己) while neglecting them,
people will surely harbor resentment.
*Death* (死矣).
If these three practices are missing even one,
*death* (死矣) will follow—
how much more so if none are practiced at all?

*Compassion* (慈): when waging war, it ensures victory;
when defending, it ensures stability.
The general who can use *compassion* to nurture and care for his soldiers,
the soldiers’ hearts will not waver—
thus, when waging war, he will be victorious,
and when defending, he will be steadfast.
Heaven will aid him,
with *compassion* as his shield.
*Compassion* moves Heaven,
and Heaven thus aids and rescues,
for the general can use *compassion* as his shield for the soldiers.

The skilled general is not fierce,
for he relies on *Dao* rather than force.
Those who delight in battle are not angry,
for they rely on *strategy* rather than rage.
The skilled victor does not contend,
for he relies on *virtue* rather than strife.
The skilled user of men places himself below them,
for he relies on *humility* rather than power.

This is called the *virtue of non-contention*,
this is called the *power of using men*,
this is called *harmonizing with Heaven*—
the ultimate of the ancients.
The four virtues above,
if one can practice them, none will fail to respond.
Thus, one attains to *align with Heaven’s Way*—
the ultimate attainment of the ancients.

On waging war, there is a saying:
*Follow the ruler’s inclinations and advance one’s Dao*.
The saying on waging war is in the following passage.

I do not dare to be the *master of the master* (主主),
first stirring others to action.
Instead, I am the *guest* (客),
and the *guest* harmonizes without singing lead.
I do not dare to advance even an inch without right,
but retreat a foot.
I defend myself and await changes.

This is called *action without action*—
the enemy is my border,
and I advance only to stop them—
not harboring intentions of slaughter or conquest.
*Repelling without arms*—
there is no anger that does not repel,
thus it seems as though one has no arms.
*Yet there is no enemy*—
not contending for victory,
thus one does not provoke battle.
*Grasping without weapons*—
relying on *virtue* rather than force.

No greater calamity than *lightly regarding the enemy*—
the *guest’s* way has no greater beginning than this.
To lightly regard the enemy risks losing my treasures.
*Treasure* (宝) is the *self* (身).
If one lightly regards the enemy and presses deep,
there will be none who do not carry corpses away.
Thus, when armies clash in battle,
the one whose soldiers are filled with *compassion* will win.
Two states raise their armies,
the *guest* and *host* forces are evenly matched—
when they meet in battle and achieve victory,
the one whose *compassion* is deeply rooted among his soldiers will triumph.

My words are very easy to know,
very easy to practice.
Saying my words are *non-action*,
they are easy to know.
If one wishes to practice them,
what difficulty could there be?

Yet none under heaven can know them,
none can practice them.
All under heaven are in turmoil,
all following *action* (有为).
*Action* and *non-action* are opposed,
and thus none can practice them.

Words have a *root* (宗),
affairs have a *lord* (君).
*Dao* is the *root*,
*virtue* is the *lord*.
Only because of *ignorance* (无知),
they do not know me.
*Ignorance* means their *perception* (识) does not reach *principle* (理).

If people cannot know my profound words,
or practice my *non-action*,
then how can *virtue and power* reach their utmost?

Few know me,
for the world has few who can know my *virtue and power*.
Thus, I am precious.
Those who know me and follow my example
are without compare in their preciousness.

Therefore, the sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade.
Within, he holds the supreme treasure,
without, he lacks ostentatious display—
thus, none under heaven can know him.

*Knowing the unknowable*—
this is *superior* (上).
*Perceiving all things*—
though one claims to know nothing,
this is true knowledge—
is it not *superior*?

*Not knowing the knowable*—
this is *illness* (病).
Standing before a wall,
knowing nothing yet claiming to know all—
this is a deluded person,
is it not *illness*?

Only because one *diseases illness*,
does one not fall ill.
The true knower
is able to regard *false knowledge* as illness and disease it,
and thus true knowledge is not ill,
while false knowledge is diseased.

The sage does not fall ill,
for he diseases illness.
If he were to fall ill himself,
he would not be able to disease others.

*(Note: This translation follows the conventions of the previous section, including the use of "Dao/Way" for 道, "qi" for 氣, and context-dependent translations of 德. Technical terms such as "sovereign" (王者), "compassion" (慈), and "frugality" (俭) are preserved as in the prior section.)*

Is thus without illness.
To test this, it is clear that one does not fall ill.

People do not fear great threat,
so great threat arrives.
The greatest of threats—
death.

All take minor evils as harmless,
yet they accumulate until they fill the measure.
When the measure is full and death comes,
is this not the arrival of great threat?

Do not narrow your dwelling.
The dwelling of the spirit—
the heart—
becomes narrow with many desires.

Do not exhaust what sustains you.
The giver of life—
the spirit—
lingers if not exhausted.
Only because one does not exhaust it,
does one not exhaust it.

If one can attain emptiness and clarity,
then the human and the spirit will be in harmony.
Thus, the sage knows himself and knows emptiness,
and the spirit lingers.
Not seeing oneself—
if one sees oneself,
then one does not fear great threat.
Self-exhaustion is not cherishing life.
Not valuing oneself—
if one values oneself,
then one narrows one’s dwelling.

Thus, abandon that and take this:
abandon self-regard and self-aggrandizement,
take self-knowledge and self-love.

To dare boldly is to kill;
if one dares boldly in desire,
then Heaven will surely kill them.
To dare not to dare is to live.
If one dares not to dare in desire,
then all under Heaven will surely live them.
Always know these two:
daring and not daring.
One brings benefit, the other harm.
Not daring brings benefit,
daring brings harm.

What does Heaven abhor?
Who knows its reason?
Heaven abhors daring boldness.
Thus, the sage finds it difficult.
This is how one understands Heaven’s abhorrence.

The Way of Heaven—
explaining the Way of Heaven to admonish humanity—
victory without strife,
though Heaven follows things,
who dares not obey its command?
Responding without speech,
though there are no spoken teachings,
the four seasons and myriad things
do not fail to respond.
Coming without being summoned,
though not called,
the three luminaries shine in order.
Mysterious and yet well-planned.
Mysterious to the utmost,
yet in killing the daring and preserving the nondaring,
never lacking—
drawing the bow by night,
never erring.
If such is the case,
it is as if within there is a master of fine strategy.

Heaven’s net is vast,
sparse yet nothing escapes.
Though the mesh is vast and wide,
the wicked cannot evade it.
People do not commonly fear death,
already constrained by punishments and laws.
How can one use death to instill fear?
If one further threatens with death penalties,
who would fear it?

If one makes people constantly fear death,
and governs with leniency,
then people will not lightly risk their lives.
As for those who act strangely,
I can seize and kill them—
who would dare?

Within the fear of death,
some may feign resistance to the law.
By the authority of my lordship,
I must seize and kill them.
What they do not dare—
is to usurp Heaven’s role.
Let those who hold the power to kill,
kill.
Thus, there will be no leakage of steel.

To usurp the role of executioner
is like a clumsy artisan taking the chisel from a master.
To have the ruler usurp Heaven
is like a clumsy man taking the place of a skilled artisan.
If one who cannot replaces one who can,
the unrefined block will not be hewn,
and the hand will surely be injured.

The people’s hunger
comes from their rulers’ excessive taxation.
Thus, they hunger.
If the ruler imposes heavy levies,
the people below will lack.
Thus, they hunger.

The difficulty in governing people
comes from the ruler’s actions.
Thus, it is difficult to govern.
If the ruler takes on many tasks,
the people below will devise schemes to counter them,
making governance difficult.

People’s disregard for death
comes from their rulers’ excessive pursuit of life.
Thus, they disregard death.
This speaks of people’s reliance on their ruler—
if the ruler greedily hoards excessive nourishment,
demands beyond measure,
the people’s ten households are nine in want,
all resenting their ruler,
and the ruler meets ruin—
is this not disregarding death?

Only those who do not cling to life
are wiser than those who value life.
To enrich life leads to its destruction,
to abandon life preserves it.
Comparing these,
those who do not value life are wiser than those who do.

When life is soft and weak,
the Way is present.
When death is firm and strong,
the Way departs.
All things—grasses and trees—
when alive, are soft and tender,
for *qi* is present.
When dead, they wither and dry,
for *qi* has dispersed.
Thus, the firm and strong belong to death,
the soft and weak belong to life.
This is evident to the eye.

Thus, strong armies do not conquer.
Warfare is an inauspicious instrument,
contrary to Heaven’s love of life,
so it is suppressed—
making the strong not conquer.

Wood that is strong rots.
Wood is naturally strong in its trunk,
yet its branches and boughs are weak,
so the weak branches grow from the strong trunk.
The strong is below,
the weak is above.
Combining life and death,
the weak lives while the strong dies—
comparing this above,
the weak is above,
the strong is below.
Yet they strive to be below and invite death—
how deeply inverted!

The Way of Heaven—
let me liken it to drawing a bow.
Using what people understand to explain the difficulty of knowing the Way of Heaven,
then even from afar, it can be seen.
The high are lowered,
the low are raised,
the excessive are diminished,
the insufficient are supplemented.
Lowering the high and raising the low,
diminishing the excessive and supplementing the insufficient—
drawing the bow thus,
only then can one hit the mark.

The Way of Heaven
diminishes the excessive and supplements the insufficient.
When the sun reaches its zenith, it declines—
this is diminishing.
When the moon wanes, it waxes anew—
this is supplementing.
*Suò*—to revive.

The Way of humanity is not so.
Human ways oppose the Way of Heaven—
this is the speech of dark rulers and common folk.
They diminish the insufficient to serve the excessive,
thus taking from the lacking to enrich the having.
Who can use the excessive to serve all under Heaven?
Only the Daoist ruler.
Who can align with Heaven?
Only the Daoist ruler—
as sovereign, he restrains the strong and comforts the weak,
as a person, he aids the needy with wealth.
This speaks of the virtuous ruler and wise scholar.

Thus, the sage acts without relying on it,
completes the work without dwelling on it,
not desiring to be seen as virtuous.
He does not boast of his excellence,
nor does he dwell on his virtue—
for he does not wish for things to see his virtue.

Under Heaven, nothing is softer or weaker than water.
Observe how it conforms to the vessel and follows humanity—
who can surpass it?

While attacking the firm and strong, none can overcome it—
its way cannot be altered.
The way water overcomes hardness is unchangeable.
Softness overcomes hardness, weakness overcomes strength—
all under Heaven know this, yet none can practice it.
Water overcomes hardness, so one knows softness overcomes hardness;
humility makes others submit, so one knows weakness overcomes strength.
This all under Heaven knows in theory,
yet when it comes to practice, none can do it.

Thus the sage says:
To bear a nation’s filth is called the master of the ancestral altars.
What people detest is filth,
yet the sage can endure it, hence he is the master of the ancestral altars.
To bear a nation’s misfortunes is called the king of all under Heaven.
What people fear is misfortune,
yet the sage can embrace it, hence he is the king of all under Heaven.
Straight speech seems reversed.
Those who practice softness and weakness
become lords and kings—
this is truly straight speech,
yet common preference for hardness and strength makes it seem reversed.

To reconcile great grudges—
grudges arise from unsettled *qi* in the heart.
Reconciliation means leaving them without cause.
Yet grudges will remain;
if one uses affairs to reconcile them,
then one only exacerbates their resentment.
How can this be called good?
If one exacerbates their resentment,
then naturally it becomes evil.

Thus the sage holds the left contract,
demanding nothing of others.
The left contract is not used in official matters.
A contract is a token of mutual agreement.
The sage holds his heart without resentment,
merely thinking to align with the *qi* of all people,
so that naturally there is no grudge—
why demand anything of others?
Thus, the virtuous ruler oversees contracts:
if one is good at reconciling grievances,
one merely oversees mutual agreement with the people.
The unvirtuous oversees *chè* (clarification).
If one meddles in reconciling grudges,
one only oversees matters to clearly demonstrate to the people—
grudges arise from this, how can it be called reconciliation?
*Chè* means clarification.

The Dao of Heaven has no favorites,
always aiding the virtuous.
The ruler with virtue is virtuous,
and the Dao of Heaven always bestows blessings upon him.
In small states with few people,
governing the great as if it were small—
the intent is to simplify and reduce taxes,
to bring peace to the people.

Let there be ten or a hundred implements,
yet they are not used.
*Shí* means things; *bǎi* means completion.
Implements are the resources people use for livelihood.
Because the ruler does not act,
the people possess these resources—
even if there are a hundred, they are not taxed for use.
The people value life and take joy in their work,
so they do not lightly risk death.
Nor do they move far away.
This is because there are no harsh policies.
Though there are boats and carriages,
there is no need to ride them—
boats can cross water, carriages can travel on land,
yet the people are self-sufficient, so there is no need to ride them.
Though there are armor and weapons,
there is no need to display them—
armor and weapons are the ruler’s tools of utility,
yet because of non-action, there is no need to display them.
The people return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.
This is to revert to antiquity.

The people find their food sweet,
knowing contentment,
so all they eat is sweet.

They adorn their dress beautifully,
yet stop at what is proper,
so there is no attire that is not beautiful.

They dwell in peace,
their desires extinguished,
so even a humble lane brings them ease.

They take joy in their customs—
without strife, their customs naturally bring them delight.

Neighboring states are close enough to see,
where the sounds of roosters and dogs intermingle,
for they are near.

The people live until old age and death,
yet do not visit one another—
they seek nothing from one another.

Truthful speech is not eloquent;
truthful speech is the Way,
so bland it lacks flavor,
and thus is not eloquent.

Eloquent speech is not truthful;
eloquent speech is alluring,
so sweet it lacks sincerity.

The virtuous do not argue;
the virtuous value action,
not idle discourse.

Those who argue are not virtuous.
Obstructed speech is not practiced,
and thus is not virtuous.

The wise are not all-knowing;
the wise value non-action.
The all-knowing are not wise—
like those who prize learning yet remain ignorant.

The Sage does not hoard;
hoarding yet knowing how to disperse,
the more one gives to others, the more one possesses.
They manifest virtue to teach others,
and as people receive its benefit,
the Sage’s virtue grows ever clearer—
like a mirror reflecting all,
people see their own virtues and flaws,
the flawed refine themselves,
the virtuous redouble their efforts,
yet the mirror’s clarity never wanes.

The more one gives to others, the more one has.
They distribute wealth to relieve the poor,
and though the poor gain aid,
the Sage’s wealth is never exhausted—
like a well from which all may draw,
those who draw gain its benefit,
yet the well is never drained.

The Dao of Heaven is beneficial yet does no harm;
Heaven’s Dao is yang,
so it cherishes life and abhors killing.
Cherishing life is why it is called beneficial,
abhorring killing is why it is called doing no harm.

The Sage’s Way acts yet does not contend.
The Sage’s actions always align with nature,
and all things respectfully follow.
