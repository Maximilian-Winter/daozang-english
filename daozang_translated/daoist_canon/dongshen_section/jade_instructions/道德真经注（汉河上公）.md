**Commentary on the Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue**
*Volume One: The Riverbank Elder’s Chaptered Exegesis*

**Chapter 1: Cultivating the Dao**

*"The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao."*
—Refers to the Dao of learning, governance, and teaching.
*"The eternal Dao cannot be spoken of."*
—Not the Dao of natural longevity.

The eternal Dao lies in:
- Nurturing the spirit through *wuwei* (non-action),
- Governing without interference,
- Concealing brilliance like jade in shadow,
- Erasing traces like water in the wind—
Thus, it cannot be named.

*"The name that can be named is not the eternal name."*
—Refers to wealth, honor, and worldly eminence.
*"The eternal name cannot be named."*
—Not a name that endures by nature.

The eternal name is like:
- An infant before speech,
- An egg before cracking,
- A pearl in its shell,
- A gem in stone—
Internally luminous, externally dull.

*"The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth."*
—The nameless is the Dao.
The Dao is formless, hence unnameable.
*"Origin"* refers to the Dao’s foundation.
From the void, it breathes *qi* and spreads transformation,
Becoming the root of Heaven and Earth.

*"The named is the mother of ten thousand things."*
—The named refers to Heaven and Earth.
Heaven and Earth have form, position, yin-yang#1, and rigidity-flexibility—
These are their names.
*"Mother of ten thousand things"*—
Heaven and Earth contain *qi*, giving birth, nurturing, and maturing all things,
Like a mother rearing her child.

Thus, *"ever without desire, to observe its subtlety"*#3—
*"Subtlety"* means *key*.
If one constantly lacks desire, they perceive the Dao’s essential truth.
*"Key"* means *oneness*.
Oneness issues forth, naming the Dao and distinguishing right from wrong.

*"Ever with desire, to observe its consequences."*
*"Consequences"* means *return*.
Those with desire reveal where the world’s pursuits lead.

These two—
Same origin, different names.
Same origin: both arise from human nature.
Different names: their objects differ.
The nameless endures; the named perishes.

*"The two are called the Mysterious."*
*"Mysterious"* means *Heavenly*.
Those with and without desire both draw *qi* from Heaven.
*"Mysterious yet more mysterious"*—
Within Heaven lies another Heaven.
Thick or thin in one’s *qi* intake:
Balanced harmony yields sages;
Turbulence and filth yield greed and lust.

*"The gateway of all subtleties."*
To know Heaven within Heaven,
To discern *qi*’s thickness or thinness,
To purge desire and uphold balance—
This is the threshold of Daoic insight.

---

**Chapter 2: Nurturing the Body**

*"All under Heaven know beauty when they see it—*
They flaunt it, making it conspicuous.
*Thus, it becomes ugliness.*
Danger and ruin follow.
*All know goodness when they see it—*
They seek it for merit and fame.
*Thus, it becomes ungoodness.*
Men contend for it.
Hence, having and lacking give rise to each other—
Seeing ‘having’ as ‘lacking.’
Difficulty and ease form each other—
Seeing ‘difficulty’ as ‘ease.’
Long and short define each other—
Seeing ‘short’ through ‘long.’
High and low incline toward each other—
Seeing ‘low’ through ‘high.’
Sounds harmonize—
The lower must respond to the upper.
Front and back follow—
The lower must follow the upper.
Thus, the Sage acts in *wuwei*,
Governing through the Dao.
Teaching without words,
Modeling with the body.
All things act without complaint,
Yet none are coerced.
Giving life without possession,
Like *yuanqi* (original *qi*) birthing all things without claim.
Acting without reliance,
The Dao’s work seeks no reward.
When the deed is done, retreat—
The Sage does not dwell on achievement.
*Only by not dwelling does it not depart.*
Virtue remains, never leaving the body.

This says:
*"The unspoken cannot be followed;
The unsaid cannot be known as urgent."*#4

---
**Chapter 3: Settling the People**

*"Do not exalt the virtuous..."*

The virtuous here refers to the worldly wise.
With eloquence and polished speech,
They abandon the Dao, relying on clever schemes,
Discarding sincerity for artifice.
To not exalt them means
Not to honor them with rank or wealth,
Nor to elevate them with office.
Thus, the people do not vie for distinction.

Not striving for fame or merit—
This is the natural way.

Not to prize rare treasures—
For when rulers do not hoard precious gems,
Gold lies abandoned in the hills,
Pearls sink forgotten in the depths.
Thus, the people do not turn to theft.

When the ruler’s virtue is pure and clear,
The people below are free from greed.
What is not seen as desirable
Is abandoned—
Banish the music of Zheng,
Keep distant the flatterers.
Thus, the heart remains undisturbed.

No licentiousness takes root.

Therefore, the Sage’s governance—
Whether of state or self—
Empties the mind,
Discarding cravings and excess,
Dispelling agitation.

Fills the belly,
Holding fast to the Dao, embracing unity,
Guarding the Five Spirits.

Weakens the will,
Cultivating softness, gentleness, humility,
Not clinging to power.

Strengthens the bones,
Cherishing essence, applying nourishment,
So marrow fills and bones grow firm.

Ever keep the people
In ignorance of knowledge, free of desire,
Returning to simplicity, guarding purity.

The wise dare not act.
Deep in thought, they speak not lightly.
They act without action,
Create nothing, move with measured ease—
Then nothing remains untended.

Their virtue profound, the people rest in peace.

**Fourth: The Dao’s Subtle Power**
The Dao flows yet acts—
Subtle, it dwells within.
It hides its name, conceals its merit,
Its work unseen, yet ever present.
It never overflows.

The Dao is ever modest, never full.
Deep as the source of all things,
It seems the ancestor of ten thousand forms.
It blunts the sharp—
The sharpness of ambition—
So the Dao remains unseen.

It unravels entanglements—
The knots of resentment—
By embracing non-action.
It dims its brilliance—
Though wisdom shines, it must not dazzle others.
It aligns with the common dust—
No separation, no distinction.
Still as the depths, yet ever present.

I know not whence it comes—
Before the Emperor of Heaven,
It endures through stillness, untroubled.
To guide the self in the Dao’s way.

**Fifth: The Virtue of Emptiness**
Heaven and Earth are not kind—
They nourish and transform without favor,
Treating all things as straw dogs.
The Sage is not kind—
Nurturing the people without favor,
Treating them as straw dogs.

Between Heaven and Earth,
If one clears the passions, discards tastes,
Purifies the Five Organs,
The spirits dwell within.
Like the hollow gourd—
Empty yet resonant—
The more it moves, the more it yields sound.
Empty yet unbroken, moving yet ever flowing.
Much speech brings exhaustion,
Much action harms the spirit.
Better to guard the center,
Nurturing the spirit, cherishing qi, speaking little.

**Sixth: The Form of Perfection**
The Valley Spirit never dies—
Nurture the spirit, and death is undone.
The spirit of the Five Organs:
The liver houses the soul,
The lungs the ethereal breath,
The heart the spirit,
The spleen the intent,
The kidneys the essence and will.
When all five are harmed, the spirits depart.

This is called the Mysterious Female—
The way of immortality lies within.
Mysterious—Heaven, in man the nose—
The nose breathes the Five Qi from Heaven into the heart,
Refining them into spirit, clarity, voice, and five natures.
Its ghost is the soul—
The soul is male, entering and exiting through the nose,
Communing with Heaven—
Thus the nose is called Mysterious.

The Female—Earth, in man the mouth—
The mouth takes the Five Flavors from Earth into the stomach,
Coarsening them into form, flesh, blood, and the Six Emotions.
Its ghost is the ethereal breath—
The ethereal breath is female, entering and exiting through the mouth,
Communing with Earth—
Thus the mouth is called Female.

The gate of the Mysterious Female
Is the root of Heaven and Earth—
The root, the origin.
The gate of nose and mouth
Is where the primal qi of Heaven and Earth circulates.

Breathing must be subtle, as if present, yet as if not.
Qi should flow gently, never strained.

**Seventh: Concealing Brilliance**
Heaven endures, Earth persists—
Teaching mortals to endure.
Heaven and Earth endure long
Because they do not strive to live—
They rest in nature, giving without seeking return,
Unlike mortals who exhaust themselves for private gain.
Thus they endure forever.

The Sage places himself last,
Yet is placed first.
He sets himself aside,
Yet is preserved.
The people love him as parents,
Revere him as gods,
Cherish him as their own.
Thus he endures.

Because he is without self,
He fulfills his own.

**Eighth: Transforming Nature**
The highest goodness is like water.
Water benefits all things
Yet does not contend.
It dwells where others scorn—
Low, damp, filthy, murky—
Thus it nears the Dao.

It rests in lowly places,
Its heart is deep.
It associates with the good,
Giving to the worthy, not the full.

Its truth is reflected—
Water mirrors forms without deceit.

**Ninth: Flowing Evenly**
Govern well, and nothing remains unclean—
Clear and level, like water’s flow.
Act skillfully, and you adapt—
Square when straight, round when curved,
Flexing to fit each form.

Move in due time—
Dispersing in summer, congealing in winter,
Acting when the season demands,
Never losing the Way of Heaven.

Only the non-contending
Is blocked, it stops;
Released, it flows—
Obedient to human will.
Thus it incurs no blame.
Water’s nature is such—
No one in the world blames water.

**Tenth: The Power of Virtue**
Hold to fullness, yet stop before completion.
Fullness means excess;
Stopping means restraint.
To cling to fullness is to invite collapse—
Better to halt in time.

Shape with sharpness, yet it cannot endure.
"Shape" means to refine—
First you refine, then you discard.
Gold and jade fill the hall,
Yet none can keep them.
Indulgence harms the spirit,
Wealth burdens the body.
Riches and honor breed arrogance—
Self-inflicted ruin follows.

When wealth should relieve the poor,
When honor should cherish the lowly,
Yet pride takes root—
Disaster will come.
When deeds are done,
When fame is secured,
Withdraw—
This is Heaven’s Way.
For what is done at high noon must move,
What is full must wane,
What is excessive must decline,
Joy at its peak turns to sorrow.

**Eleventh: Nurturing Vitality**
Carry the spirit-souls—
The spirit-souls are the *hun* and *po*.
Humans rely on them to live—
Cherish and nourish them.
Joy and rage scatter the spirit,
Sudden fright harms the soul.
The spirit dwells in the liver,
The soul in the lungs.
Fine wine and rich foods damage them.
Thus, when the spirit is calm and the mind aligned,
The soul rests, and life is prolonged.

Can one not hold to Oneness?
If one embraces Oneness,
It will not depart.
Oneness is the essence of virtue and Dao,
The refined *qi* of Great Harmony.
Thus it is called Oneness.
Oneness spreads through the world—
Heaven gains Oneness and becomes clear,
Earth gains Oneness and becomes tranquil,
Rulers gain Oneness and achieve rectitude.
Within, it is the heart;
Without, it is action.
Generosity is its virtue—
All called Oneness.
Oneness means single-mindedness,
Without division.

Focus the *qi* to attain softness—
Guard the vital essence so it does not scatter,
And the body will respond with yielding grace.

Can you be like an infant?
Within, no scheming;
Without, no governance—
Then the spirit remains undisturbed.

Purify and gaze into the void—
Cleanse the heart to make it pure.
The heart dwells in the profound darkness,
Perceiving all things—
Thus it is called *xuanlan* [profound vision].
Can you remain without blemish?
Do not indulge in depravity.

「To love the people and govern the state,
To govern the self—
Receiving *qi* preserves the body whole.
To govern the state—
Loving the people secures the realm’s peace.
Can you be without action?
To govern the self—
Breathing *jingqi* [精气], without letting it be heard by the ears.
To govern the state—
Dispensing virtue and benevolence, without letting the people below know of it.
The Celestial Gate opens and shuts—
The Celestial Gate, the North Pole’s Purple Forbidden Enclosure [北极紫微宫].
Opening and shutting, the five phases of beginning and end.
The Celestial Gate of governing the self refers to the nostrils—
Opening means panting,
Shutting means breathing.
Can you be without duality?
To govern the self, one should be like the female and male—
Stable, tranquil, soft, and weak.
To govern the state, one adapts to circumstances—
Harmonious yet not boastful.

Illuminating and far-reaching—
The Dao is clear as the sun and moon,
Fourfold and boundless beyond the eight extremes of the world.
Thus it is said:
*"To see yet not be seen,
To hear yet not be heard,
To manifest in all ten directions,
Resplendent and radiant beyond measure."*
Can you be without knowing?
There is none who can know the Dao’s fulfillment throughout the world.

Nurturing and sustaining—
The Dao generates all things and sustains them.
Generating yet not possessing—
The Dao generates all things, yet takes none for itself.
Acting yet not relying—
The Dao’s deeds are done without expectation of reward.
Lengthening yet not slaughtering—
The Dao nourishes all things without carving or using them as tools.
This is called *xuande* [profound virtue].
The Dao’s virtue is profound and dark,
Desiring to make people know it yet unseen.

The Tenth Principle of Non-Utilization
Thirty spokes join one hub—
Ancient chariots had thirty spokes,
A measure of the moon’s cycles.
All spokes converge at a single hub,
For the hub has a hollow core,
And thus the spokes gather around it.
To govern the self, one must purge emotions and desires,
Empty the five *zang* [内脏],
So that the spirit may return.
When the hub is hollow, the chariot’s function is fulfilled;
When the self is emptied, its purpose is realized.
The hub’s emptiness allows the wheels to turn;
The center’s void lets the carriage bear its load.
Molding clay to make vessels—
*Bing* [埏] means blending,
*Zhi* [埴] means earth.
Blending earth to craft utensils for food and drink.
When the vessel is hollow, its use is fulfilled;
The vessel’s emptiness allows it to receive.
Piercing doors and windows to make a dwelling—
To construct rooms and houses.
When the dwelling is hollow, its use is fulfilled.
The doors and windows’ emptiness lets people enter and exit;
The dwelling’s emptiness lets people reside within.
Thus, having is for utility—
*Li* [利], meaning "things."
Things manifest in use—
The vessel contains objects,
The dwelling holds people,
Yet fear that the house may be destroyed;
Fear that the body’s spirit may perish.
The principle of non-utilization—
The hollow void alone can embrace all forms.
Thus it is said:
*"The empty and the void can govern the having and the form."*
The Dao is the empty and the void.

The Eleventh Principle of Restrained Desire
The five colors blind the eyes—
Lusting after the five colors,
The vital essence is drained, and clarity is lost;
One cannot perceive the colorless.
The five tones deaf the ears—
Enjoying the five tones,
The harmonious *qi* departs the heart,
And one cannot hear the soundless.
The five flavors dull the palate—
*Shuang* [爽], meaning "to lose."
Indulging in the five flavors,
One loses the Dao’s true taste.
Chasing and hunting in the fields cause the mind to go mad—
The spirit prefers tranquility;
Excessive movement scatters the essence,
Thus the mind goes mad.
Hard-to-obtain treasures bring hindrance to conduct—
*Fang* [妨], meaning "to harm."
Gold, silver, jade, and pearls—
The heart is burdened by greed,
Ignorant of contentment,
And thus one’s actions harm the body and bring disgrace.
Therefore, the sage governs the belly—
Guarding the five *xing* [性],
Discarding the six *qing* [情],
Moderating the will,
Nurturing the spirit and clarity.
Not the eyes—
The eyes do not gaze wantonly,
For wanton gazing drains the essence outward.
Thus, discard that and take this—
Discard the eyes’ wanton gazing,
Take the belly’s spirit-nurturing.
The Thirteenth Principle of Satiety and Shame
Honor and disgrace like a startling alarm—
To be honored is to be startled,
To be disgraced is to be startled.
Great calamities are feared like they touch the self—
*Gui* [贵], meaning "to revere."
*Ran* [患], meaning "calamity."
When great calamities approach the self,
Thus one is startled.
What is meant by honor and disgrace?
Asking what is honor, what is disgrace.
Honor is dignity and glory,
Disgrace is shame and debasement.
To receive honor and glory like a startling alarm—
To attain high station is to be startled,
As if standing at the edge of danger.
Wealth does not dare to be extravagant,
Status does not dare to be arrogant.
To lose honor and glory like a startling alarm—
To lose favor is to be disgraced,
And one is startled by fear that calamity will return.
This is called *"honor and disgrace like a startling alarm."*

To resolve the above—
To receive honor and glory like a startling alarm,
To lose it like a startling alarm.
What is meant by *"great calamities are feared like they touch the self"*?
Returning to the question—
My great calamity arises from my having a self.
My great calamity arises from my having a self.
Having a self brings worry of toil,
Reflection on hunger and cold.
Indulging in emotions and desires,
Then calamity befalls.
When I have no self,
What calamity do I have?
If I have no self,
My body aligns with the Dao naturally—
Lightly ascending to the clouds,
Entering and exiting without obstruction,
Communing with the Dao’s spirit,
What calamity could there be?
Thus, the noble who values the self above the world
Can entrust themselves to the world—
The ruler holds their self in high regard,
Yet devalues the people,
Desiring to be the world’s master,
And thus can rely on the world yet not be trusted.
The loving who values the self above the world
Can entrust the world to themselves—
The ruler who loves their self,
Not for themselves alone,
But as the parent of all people,
With this virtue as the world’s sovereign,
Can entrust their self to the people above,
Enduring no blame for long.

The Fourteenth Principle of Praising the Profound
*"To see yet not be seen"* is called *yi* [夷]—
The colorless is *yi*.
The Dao is without hue,
And thus cannot be seen.
*"To hear yet not be heard"* is called *xi* [希]—
The soundless is *xi*.
The Dao is without sound,
And thus cannot be heard.
*"To grasp yet not obtain"* is called *wei* [微]—
The formless is *wei*.
The Dao is without substance,
And thus cannot be seized.»

---

This triad cannot be questioned or examined,
Three things: *yi* [夷], *xi* [希], and *wei* [微].
That which cannot be questioned or examined—
It is the colorless, the soundless, the formless.
The mouth cannot speak of it,
The written word cannot transmit it.
Received in stillness, sought with the spirit,
It cannot be questioned yet is known.

Thus, it blends into oneness.
*Hun* [混] means to merge.
Therefore, the three names unite as one.
Above, it shines without brightness—
The one in the heavens,
Not dimly luminous, yet boundless above and below.
Below, it is without obscurity—
The one in the world,
Not dimly veiled in darkness or hidden depths.

It flows ceaselessly, yet cannot be named—
*Shuangshuang* [绳绳], ceaseless motion.
It cannot be named,
Not a single hue—
Not distinguishable by blue, yellow, red, white, or black.
Not a single sound—
Not discerned by the five tones of *gōng* [宫], *shāng* [商], *jué* [角], *zhǐ* [征], or *yǔ* [羽].
Not a single form—
Not measured by length, shortness, smallness, or greatness.
Returning to the formless.

*Wu* [物] means substance.
Substance must return to the formless.
This is called the *state* [状] of the formless—
The one without form yet able to shape all things.
The *image* [象] of the formless—
The one without substance yet able to manifest all forms.
This is called *hūhuǎng* [忽恍]—
The one that is indistinct, as if present or absent,
Unseen.

To meet it, you cannot see its beginning—
The one without start or end,
Unpredictable.
To abandon passions and desires,
The one returns to itself#11.

To follow it, you cannot see its trace—
The one without shadow or mark,
Unseen.
To hold the ancient Dao,
And thus govern the present—
The sage grasps the ancient Dao,
Generates the one to govern all things,
Knows that the present must also return to the one.
To know the ancient origin,
This is called the *Dao*’s *jì* [纪].

If one can know the ancient origin of the one,
This is called knowing the *Dao*’s fundamental threads.
**The Fifteenth Principle of Manifesting Virtue**

The ancient adept at being a *shì* [士]—
The ruler who obtained the Dao.
Subtle and profound, penetrating the heavens,
Heavenly [玄] refers to the Dao.
Their resolve and conduct are profound and subtle,
Their spirit in harmony with the Dao.
Deep beyond recognition.

Virtue and power are profound and distant,
Beyond recognition.
Internally, they see as if blind,
They turn and hear as if deaf,
None know their excellence.

Only because it cannot be recognized,
They forcefully assume its guise—
That is to say: the following lines.

*Yù* [豫]—like winter crossing a river,
Cautious and deliberate in all actions,
*Yùyù* [豫豫]—like winter crossing a river,
Their heart finds it difficult.
*Yóu* [犹]—like fearing the four neighbors,
Their advance is hesitant, as if restrained,
Like one who has broken the law,
Feared for the four neighbors’ judgment.
*Yǎn* [俨]—like a guest,
As a guest before their host,
They are dignified yet unassuming.
*Huàn* [涣]—like ice about to dissolve,
*Huàn* means to disperse,
*Shì* [释] means to vanish,
That is to say: abandoning passions and desires,
Daily emptiness.
*Dūn* [敦]—like undifferentiated simplicity,
*Dūn* means solid and thick,
*Pǔ* [朴] means unrefined form,
Internally guarding the spirit,
Externally without ornamentation.
*Kuàng* [旷]—like a valley,
*Kuàng* means vast and spacious,
A *gǔ* [谷]#12 is emptiness,
Without virtue, achievement, or name,
Yet encompassing all.
*Hún* [浑]—like turbid water,
*Hún* means to preserve their true nature,
Turbid [浊] means not clearly evident,
In harmony with the common yet not self-exalted.

Who can, like turbid water,
Cease and settle, then gradually clear?
Who can, with stillness,
Endure motion for long, then gradually arise?

Those who preserve this Dao
Do not desire excess.
Preserving this Dao of longevity,
They do not desire indulgence or overflow.
Only because they do not overflow,
They can endure wear without renewal.

Only those who do not overflow
Can guard against decay,
Hiding their brilliance.
Renewal means valuing achievement and name.

**The Sixteenth Principle of Returning to the Root**

Reach the utmost emptiness—
*Zhì* [致] means to attain.
The Daoist abandons passions and desires,
The five *zàng* [藏] organs are pure and still,
Attaining the utmost emptiness.
Guard steadfast stillness—
Guard purity and stillness,
Practice with sincerity and depth.

All things arise together—
*Zuò* [作] means to generate.
All things generate together.
With this, I observe their return.

That is to say: I observe all things
Returning to their origin,
Humans must cherish their root.

Things are abundant and flourishing—
*Yún yún* [芸芸], the appearance of blossoms and leaves.
Each returns to its root.
That is to say: all things
Without fail wither and fall,
Returning to their root to regenerate.
Returning to the root is called stillness—
Stillness refers to the root.
The root is tranquil, soft, and weak,
Humble and lowly, thus it does not die again.
Stillness is called returning to *mìng* [命]—
To be able to remain tranquil
Is called returning to one’s original nature and vitality,
Thus one does not die.
Returning to *mìng* is called *cháng* [常]—
Returning to *mìng* prevents death,
This is the Dao’s eternal practice.
Knowing *cháng* is called *míng* [明]—
To know the Dao’s eternal practice
Is called enlightenment.
Not knowing *cháng*, yet acting arbitrarily,
Is perilous.
Knowing *cháng*, one is inclusive—
To know the Dao’s eternal practice,
One abandons passions and desires,
Embracing all without exception.

To embrace is to be impartial—
Without exception, one is impartial and just,
All evils cannot withstand.
Impartiality is called *wáng* [王]—
Impartial and just,
One can rule the world,
Correcting the body’s essence,
Form unified and still,
Spirit enlightened for myriad ages,
All converging within oneself.
*Wáng* is called *tiān* [天]—
To rule is to harmonize with virtue,
Spirit enlightened now communicates with heaven.
Heaven is called *Dào* [道]—
Virtue harmonizes with heaven,
Thus it unites with the Dao.
The Dao is called *jiǔ* [久]—
To unite with the Dao is to endure.
To perish without harm—
To be impartial, to rule,
Harmonizing with heaven and uniting with the Dao,
All four perfected,
Virtue and power vast and distant,
No misfortune or blame,
Thus one perishes with heaven and earth,
Never in peril.

*The True Classic of the Dao and Virtue* (Annotations, Scroll Two)
*Commentary by Master He Shanggong*

**17. The Primordial Wind:**
The Most High, the lowest know of His existence.
The Most High refers to the sovereign of the primordial age, before names were given.
The lowest know of His existence yet do not serve Him—this is the simplicity of the unrefined.

The next stage: they are close to Him and praise Him.
His virtue is visible, His benevolence and grace are worthy of praise,
so they love and honor Him.

The next stage: they fear Him.
He governs through laws and punishments.

The next stage: they scorn Him.
He imposes many prohibitions, causing confusion,
and they cannot be brought to sincerity, so they deceive and mock Him.

If this is insufficient:
When the sovereign’s trust is lacking among the people,
the people then deceive and betray him above.
If this is untrustworthy:
When the sovereign’s trust is lacking among the people,
the people respond with their own lack of trust and deceive their sovereign.

Thus, the Most High values speech.
The sovereign of the primordial age acted with restraint,
valuing speech above all else,
for fear of straying from the Dao and losing naturalness.

When achievements are complete and affairs settled,
the world is in great peace.
The people all say, "This is natural."
The people do not know that the sovereign’s virtue is pure and profound,
but instead take it as their own inherent nature.

**18. The Crassness of Custom:**
When the Great Dao is abandoned, there arises benevolence and righteousness.
In the age of the Great Dao,
families had filial children, states had loyal and trustworthy subjects,
and benevolence and righteousness were not yet seen.
When the Great Dao is abandoned and not practiced,
evil and perversity arise,
and then benevolence and righteousness can be transmitted as the Dao.

When wisdom appears, there arises great deceit.
The wise sovereigns devalue virtue and exalt speech,
devalue simplicity and exalt ornamentation,
and the people respond with great deceit and cunningness.

When the six bonds of kinship are severed, there arises filial piety and kindness.
When the six bonds of kinship are broken and relatives do not harmonize,
then filial piety and kindness arise to nurture and care for them.

When the state is in chaos and confusion, there arise loyal ministers.
When governance fails and orders are not followed,
the ruler and subjects blame each other,
while the wicked vie for power,
then loyal ministers arise to rectify their sovereign.

This is to say:
In the age of the Great Dao, the people do not know benevolence,
when desires are fully satisfied, they do not know contentment,
when each purifies themselves, they do not know integrity.
Thus, in the age of the Great Dao,
filial piety and kindness vanish,
benevolence and righteousness fade away—
just as the sun and moon shine brightly,
while the stars lose their luster.

**19. Reverting to Simplicity:**
Abandon the Sage...

Abandon the Sage’s artifices, return to the origin, and uphold the primal Way.
The Five Emperors drew symbols, and Cang Jie created writing—
yet this was not as effective as the Three Sovereigns’ knotted cords,
which governed without scripture.

Abandon wisdom,
abandon cleverness and cunning,
return to non-action.
The people’s benefits multiply a hundredfold;
agriculture thrives, and public affairs are without private gain.

Abandon benevolence and righteousness,
abandon the cleverness that sees benevolence,
abandon the ostentation that values righteousness.
The people return to filial piety and kindness—
for virtue’s transformation is pure.

Abandon artifice.
Those who abandon artifice prevent deceit from corrupting truth.
Abandon profit,
block the paths of greed, and close the gates of power.
Thieves and robbers vanish.
The ruler’s transformation is public and just,
and the people below have no private deceit.
These three are called the three uppermost affairs to abandon.

Because scripture is insufficient,
because scripture is insufficient to transform the people,
therefore let governance have its proper place.
As the following verse states:

Embrace simplicity and preserve purity—
to embrace simplicity is to hold fast to simplicity and truth,
not to value ornamentation.
To preserve purity is to manifest one’s natural sincerity to the world,
so that it may be emulated.
Fewer private interests, fewer desires.
To have fewer private interests is to correct the absence of private gain.
To have fewer desires is to know contentment.

**Chapter 20: Divergent Customs**
Abandon learning.

**Chapter 20: Divergent Customs** (continued)

Abandon learning without attaining truth—
this does not align with the **Dao/Way** and its teachings.
Be free from worries.
Eliminate superficiality and extravagance, then there will be no worries.

What is the difference between *Zhi* and *A*?
Both are responses to the times,
yet their difference is vast.

The rulers of our age despise genuine virtue
and exalt mere ornamentation.
How far apart are good and evil?
The good are praised,
the evil are rebuked—
how can they truly be distinguished?

The rulers of our age prefer treacherous flatterers
to loyal and upright ministers.
What is it that people fear?
People fear the **Dao/Way** of the learned.
What they truly fear is the ruler who does not abandon learning.
One must indeed fear this.

The current rulers favor superficial display,
slaying the virtuous and the wise.
Oh, the chaos—
it knows no end!

Speaking of the vulgar masses,
they pursue learning only to indulge in empty ornamentation#3,
yet their corruption cannot be halted.

The common people revel in excess,
in licentiousness and indulgence,
in boundless desires.
Like feasting on the **Tailao** sacrificial offerings,
they crave abundance as if starving,
yet their hunger is never satisfied.
Like ascending a terrace in spring,
spring, when *yin* and *yang* intermingle,
and all things are stirred—
to stand upon the terrace and gaze,
their minds overflow with wantonness.

Yet I alone stand in dread,
without any sign of desire.
Like an infant before it speaks,
or a younger sibling unable yet to answer others.
I drift, drifting—
as if without destination.

I drift like one lost in the remote wilderness,
with nowhere to turn.
While others have abundance,
others hoard wealth to indulge in luxury,
and excess knowledge to deceive with.
I alone seem cast aside,
as though lacking—
my heart is that of a simpleton.

I do not conform to the world,
steadfast in the One, unmoved,
like the heart of a simpleton.

Pure and unadulterated—
without distinction or division.
The common people are bright and clear,
illuminated and discerning.

I alone seem dim—
as though in darkness.
Others are keen and sharp,
urgent and swift.

I alone am murky—
murky, without division or separation.
Vast as the sea,
I alone drift, drifting—
like the ebb and flow of rivers and oceans,
unknown in their depths.

I drift—
drifting like windborne dust or lifted feathers,
without end,
my will and intent in the realm of the spirit.

Others all have *doings*—
they cling to action.
Yet I alone am obstinate,
I alone do nothing,
seeming crude.
Crude, as though inadequate.

I alone differ from others,
differing from the crowd,
yet I alone honor the *Mother*.
*Mother*—the Dao.
Only I alone honor the Dao’s use.

**Chapter Twenty-One: The Virtue of the Hollow**

The bearing of great virtue—
great, vast—
one of great virtue contains all,
able to receive filth and turbidity,
dwelling in humility and openness.
Only the Dao is followed.
Only—uniquely—
one of great virtue does not conform to worldly ways,
but follows the Dao alone.

The Dao, as a thing,
is only vague and indistinct.
The Dao, toward all things,
uniquely drifts and vanishes,
without fixed form.

Vague, indistinct—
yet within it, there is substance.
The Dao is only vague and indistinct,
yet within it, there is the One.

It nurtures and transforms life,
establishing form through *qi*.
Indistinct, vague—
yet within it, there are patterns.
The Dao is only profound and formless,
yet within it, the laws of all things reside.

Profound, dark—
yet within it, there is essence.
The Dao is only profound and dark,
yet within it lies the true essence,
where divine and mortal intermingle,
where *yin* and *yang* converge.
Its essence is most true—
the Dao’s essence, *qi*, and spirit are most wondrous and true,
without ornamentation.
Within it, there is sincerity.
The Dao conceals its deeds and hides its name,
yet sincerity abides within.

From ancient times to now,
its name does not fade—
from, since.
Since ancient times to now, the Dao remains ever-present.
It nourishes all beginnings.
*Nourishes*—receives.
*Beginnings*—origins.
How do I know all things begin thus?
By this.

The **Benef of Modesty** (Chapter 22)

If one bends, one is whole.
Bend oneself to follow the multitude,
do not assert oneself alone—
then one remains whole.

If one is crooked, one becomes straight.
Crooked—bent.
Bending oneself while extending to others,
over time, one naturally attains straightness for oneself.

If one is lowly, one is filled.
The earth is lowly and deep; water flows to it.
Humility in a person—
virtue flows to them.

If one is afflicted, one is renewed.
When one bears hardship lightly,
puts others before oneself,
the world respects them—
over time, one renews oneself.

If one is few, one gains much.
When one receives little,
one obtains much in return.

The Dao favors the modest,
the spirits and *qi* benefit the humble.
Excess leads to confusion.
Those with much wealth—
confused by what they must guard.
Those with much learning—
confused by what they must hear.

Thus, the Sage embraces unity as a model for all under heaven.
Embrace—guard.
Model—law.
The Sage guards unity,
knowing all things,
thus able to serve as the law for all under heaven.

Not self-assertive, hence clear.
The Sage does not use his own eyes to see beyond a thousand *li*,
but relies on the eyes of all under heaven to see,
thus able to perceive and reach far.

Not self-righteous, hence illustrious.
The Sage does not assume his own correctness while rejecting others,
thus able to shine brightly in the world.

Not self-praising, hence meritorious.
Praise—take.
The Sage’s virtue spreads naturally,
not taking credit for his own excellence,
thus his merit is recognized by all under heaven.

Not self-glorifying, hence enduring.
Glorify—magnify.
The Sage does not magnify his own greatness,
thus able to endure without peril.

Only by not striving,
does the world find none who can contend with them.
This means that all under heaven—
whether virtuous or unvirtuous—
none can contend with those who do not strive.

The ancients spoke of *"bending brings wholeness"*—
was this mere empty talk?
Passed-down words: *"Bend and follow, and one is whole,"*
proven true.
Thus, sincerity is whole and returns to its source.
Sincerity—reality.
Those who can practice bending and following—
their bodies are unharmed,
returning to their parents,
without injury.

The **Vacuity of Nonbeing** (Chapter 23)

Rarely spoken of—
nature’s spontaneity.

Thus, *"rarely spoken"* means loving speech.
Loving speech is the Dao/Way of nature.
Gusts of wind do not last through the morning,
sudden rains do not last through the day.
Gusts of wind—swift winds.
Sudden rains—torrent rains.
Swiftness cannot endure,
violence cannot last.
Who causes this?
The heavens and earth.
Who causes these gusts and torrents?
It is the heavens and earth that do so.
Even the heavens and earth cannot endure long,
cannot persist from morning to evening.
Then how much less can mortals?
The heavens and earth are most divine,
yet when they combine to produce gusts and torrents,
they cannot even make them follow from morning to afternoon—
how much less can mortals, then, and desire to emulate their completion?

Thus, those who follow the Dao/Way,
*"follow"* meaning to act in accordance with—
when mortals act, they should be as tranquil as the Dao,
not as gusting and torrential.
Those who follow the Dao/Way are in harmony with the Dao/Way,
meaning their actions align with the Dao.
Those who embody **virtue/power** are in harmony with **virtue/power**,
meaning their actions align with **virtue/power**.
Those who are lost are in harmony with loss.
*"Lost"* means to burden oneself while neglecting others.
Those in harmony with loss—
their actions align with loss.
Those in harmony with the Dao/Way, the Dao/Way delights in them;
those in harmony with **virtue/power**, **virtue/power** delights in them;
those in harmony with loss, loss delights in them.
Faith is insufficient here—
if a ruler lacks faith below,
the subjects respond with disbelief.
There is disbelief.
This speaks of things returning to their kind—
like sounds resonate, clouds follow the dragon, winds follow the tiger,
water flows to moisture, fire seeks dryness—
these are nature’s laws.
The **Virtue of Benevolence** (Chapter 24)
The **limping** do not stand,

The **limping** are those who advance.
They who covet power and usurp fame,
who seek glory and gain—
cannot long stand firm in the Dao/Way.

The **straddling** do not walk.
They who exalt themselves above others,
the crowd conspires to obstruct them,
so they cannot proceed.

The **self-seeing** are blind.
Men who admire their own appearance as beautiful,
who deem their own actions the Dao/Way—
they fail to see their own ugliness,
their own vulgar conduct.

The **self-righteous** are not renowned.
They who insist they are right while others are wrong—
the crowd conspires to obscure them,
so they remain unillustrious.

The **self-praising** achieve nothing.
They who claim credit for their deeds,
in truth, lose the merit of true contribution.

The **self-glorifying** do not endure.
They who boast of their greatness
cannot long persist.
In the Dao/Way, they are called *"excessive food, superfluous actions."*
Superfluous—meaning *noble* in excess.
If such men govern the state,
they tax and extort,
hoarding surplus wealth—
their actions are gluttonous.
All things recoil in hatred.
When they hold office,
their every move brings harm,
so all fear and detest them.
Thus, the Dao/Way does not dwell there.

**Symbol of the Origin** (Chapter 25)
There exists a formless, mixed unity,
born before Heaven and Earth.
This is the Dao/Way—
shapeless, indistinct,
yet giving birth to all things,
existing before Heaven and Earth.

Silent and void,
it stands alone, unchanging.
Silent—without sound.
Void—without form.
Alone—without equal.
Unchanging—its transformations are eternal.

It moves in cycles without exhaustion,
permeating Heaven and Earth,
unscathed in the sun, uncorrupted in the shade,
penetrating all without peril.
It can be the mother of the world.
The Dao/Way nurtures the vital essence of all things,
as a mother nurtures her child.

I do not know its name—
so I call it the Dao/Way.
I do not see its form—
so I name it thus.
Seeing all things arise from the Dao/Way,
I name it the Dao/Way.
Forced to name it, I call it *Great*.
I do not know its name—
so I forcefully call it *Great*.

Lofty yet without summit,
encompassing yet without bounds—
thus it is *Great*.
Great is called *Fleeting*—
not like Heaven, always above,
not like Earth, always below.
Yet it departs, without fixed abode.

Fleeting is called *Distant*—
its distance extends to the boundless,
its qi permeating Heaven and Earth,
unobstructed in its passage.

Distant is called *Returning*—
its vastness does not sever,
but returns within the human realm.
Thus, the Dao/Way is Great,
Heaven is Great,
Earth is Great,
and the Sovereign is Great.

The Dao/Way is Great—
encompassing Heaven and Earth,
containing all without exclusion.
Heaven is Great—
covering all without omission.
Earth is Great—
bearing all without burden.
The Sovereign is Great—
commanding all without opposition.

Within the Four Extremes, there are Four Great Ones,
and the Sovereign is one of them.

Humans model themselves after Earth—
quiet, still, yielding, gentle—
planted, they yield grain;
dug, they yield sweet springs.
They labor without complaint,
perform deeds without expectation of reward.

Earth models itself after Heaven—
clear and undisturbed,
bestowing without seeking return,
nurturing all things without taking.

Heaven models itself after the Dao/Way—
the Dao/Way acts without speech,
its subtle qi flowing—
all things arise naturally.

The Dao/Way models itself after *Nature*.

**Chapter on Weighty Virtue** (Chapter 26)
Weight is the root of lightness—
a ruler who does not hold weight is not revered,
a man who does not hold weight loses his spirit.
Grass and trees, flowers and leaves are light—
thus they wither and fall.
Roots are heavy—
thus they endure.

Stillness is the master of agitation—
a ruler who is not still loses his authority,
a man who is not still endangers himself.
The dragon is still—
thus it transforms.
The tiger is agitated—
thus it perishes young.

Therefore, the Sage moves all day
yet never departs from his stillness.
His carriage is his stillness.
The gentleman walks the Dao/Way
yet never departs from his weighty composure.

Though he enjoys palaces and concubines,
he remains detached.
Palaces—meaning the royal halls.
Concubines—meaning the inner chambers.
Detached—meaning he avoids them.

How can the sovereign of ten thousand chariots
be so light in the world?
*How*—meaning he laments the pain of his time.
Yet he conducts himself lightly before all.

The sovereign’s excess and dissipation
drain his vital essence.
Lightness leads to losing his ministers,
agitation leads to losing his throne.
Agitation leads to losing his spirit.

**Chapter on Skillful Action** (Chapter 27)
The skilled practitioner leaves no trace.

The adept in the Dao/Way seeks it within himself,
never descending from his hall,
never stepping beyond his door—
thus leaving no trace.

The adept in speech has no flaws or blemishes,
for he selects his words with care,
and thus commits no errors before the world.

The adept in calculation needs no tally sticks,
for he adheres to the One without deviation,
and his schemes are few—
thus he knows without reckoning.

The adept in closure requires no locks or keys,
for he seals his passions and guards his spirit
more securely than doors with bolts.

The adept in binding needs no ropes or cords,
for he binds his heart—
more firmly than any tether.

Therefore, the Sage is always adept at saving people,
teaching them loyalty and filial piety
to rescue their very lives.
Thus, he abandons no one;
nobles and commoners each find their place.

He is always adept at saving things,
harmonizing with the Four Seasons
to rescue all creatures from harm.
Thus, he abandons nothing.

The Sage does not demean stone while honoring jade,
regarding them as one.
This is called *clinging to clarity*.

The Sage is adept at saving both people and things—
this is called *clinging to the Great Dao/Way*.

Thus, the virtuous become teachers for the unvirtuous,
for those who act rightly are made the Sage’s guides for others.

The unvirtuous become resources for the virtuous—
*resources*, meaning tools.
Even when people act wrongly,
they may still be guided toward virtue,
thus serving a purpose.

To dishonor one’s teacher
is to have no aid.
To disregard one’s resource
is to have nothing to employ.
Though one may claim wisdom,
such a person is deeply deluded.
This is called *the essential mystery*.

To grasp this Dao/Way is to know the subtle and essential.

**Chapter on Returning to Simplicity** (Chapter 28)
Knowing the masculine, he guards the feminine,
and becomes the valley of the world.
*The masculine*—meaning exalted status,
*the feminine*—meaning humility.
Though one knows his own exaltation,
he must guard his humility,
abandoning the masculine’s rigidity
and embracing the feminine’s gentleness—
thus the world flows toward him,
like water gathering in deep valleys.

To become the valley of the world,
his virtue remains unbroken.
He returns to the infant.
He must return his mind to the simplicity of the infant,
clumsy and unaware.

Knowing the bright, he guards the dark,
and becomes the model of the world.
*The bright*—meaning clarity,
*the dark*—meaning stillness.
Though one knows his own clarity,
he must guard it with silence,
as if in darkness, seeing nothing—
thus he becomes the standard for the world,
and his virtue remains unerring.

To become the model of the world,
his virtue never falters.
He returns to the boundless.

Knowing honor, he guards disgrace,
and becomes the valley of the world.
*Honor*—meaning nobility,
*disgrace*—meaning impurity.
Though one knows his own nobility,
he must guard it with humility,
as if stained—
thus the world flows toward him,
like water entering deep valleys.

To become the valley of the world,
his virtue is complete.
*Complete*—meaning settled.
He returns to simplicity.

When simplicity disperses, it becomes tools.
When the Dao disperses, it becomes spirit and clarity,
becoming the sun and moon,
dividing into the Five Phases.
The Sage employs it,
and it becomes officials and leaders.
Thus, great governance does not harm.

To govern the body, he employs the Dao
to regulate passions,
without harming the spirit.

**Chapter on Non-Action** (Chapter 29)
When one seeks to take the world by force,
I see it as inevitable failure.
The Dao/Way abhors complexity and filth,
human hearts abhor excess desire.
The world is a sacred vessel—
it cannot be seized.

*Vessel*—meaning essence.
Humans are the sacred essence of the world.
The sacred essence prefers tranquility
and cannot be governed by force.

Action ruins it,
grasping loses it.
Forcing instruction breeds deceit.

Thus, some advance, some retreat,
some are warmed, some are chilled,
some are strong, some are weak,
some are secure, some are endangered.

Therefore, the enlightened ruler cannot govern by force.
Thus, the Sage rejects excess,
rejects extravagance,
rejects extravagance.
*Excess*—meaning gluttony for sounds and colors,
*extravagance*—meaning attire, food, and dwellings,
*extravagance*—meaning palaces and pavilions.
Abandoning these three,
dwelling in moderation,
practicing non-action,
the world transforms itself.

**Chapter on Frugal Military Strategy** (Chapter 30)
To assist a ruler with the Dao/Way
is to have him govern without arms,
conquering the world without force.
His actions return to him naturally,
without blame.

Where his army passes,
thorns and brambles grow.
For agriculture is neglected,
fields left untended.
After great armies,
there are always years of famine.

The **Heaven** responds with the *killing qi*, and thus harms the five grains.
When the five grains are exhausted, it harms the people as well.

The virtuous act decisively, yet with restraint.
The virtuous wielders of arms—when they act decisively, they must dare to do so with restraint,
not seeking glory.
They do not dare to claim strength through conquest.
They do not seek the name of mighty armies through decisive yet arrogant actions.
Act decisively yet do not boast—when one acts decisively, they must remain humble,
not prideful in their strength.
Act decisively yet do not take credit—when one acts decisively, they must yield and not claim glory for themselves.
Act decisively yet do not be arrogant—arrogance is deception.
When one acts decisively, they must not deceive others with arrogance.
Act decisively only when unavoidable—when unavoidable, they must do so with utmost sincerity,
not through coercion or desperate compulsion.
Act decisively yet do not force—decisive action must not be seen as brute strength or impenetrable armor,
to oppress others.

When things flourish, they grow old—
when grass and trees reach their peak, they wither and fall,
when people reach their peak, they decline and age.
This means that strength cannot endure long.
This is called *not the Dao*—
those who wither and age sit and fail to follow the Dao.
Not the Dao leads to early ruin.
Those who do not follow the Dao die early.

**Chapter on Laying Down Arms** (Chapter 31)
Fine arms are not auspicious implements—
*auspicious* means *good*.
Arms are instruments that disturb the spirit,
cloud the harmonious *qi*—
they are not good implements,
and should not be adorned.

Some things are naturally repugnant—
when arms are used, harm is inevitable,
so all things naturally abhor them.
Thus, those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.
Those who follow the Dao do not dwell in their lands.

The **gentleman** in peace values the left—
valuing the soft and yielding.
In war, they value the right—
valuing the strong and resolute.
This says that the Dao of arms is contrary to the Dao of the gentleman,
and what they cherish is different.

Arms are not auspicious implements,
nor are they the instruments of the gentleman—
not the implements the gentleman cherishes.
Only when unavoidable are they used—
when facing decline or calamity,
to protect the people,
not to plunder lands or covet wealth and treasures.
Victory yet without glory—
even if they achieve victory, they do not take pride in it.

But those who take pride in victory—
those who delight in killing—
are those who revel in slaughtering others.
Those who excel in achieving victory
are those who are said to take joy in killing.

He who takes joy in killing
cannot fulfill his ambitions in the world.
For a ruler who takes joy in killing,
this is why he cannot make his will prevail in the world.

A sovereign who delights in killing
must necessarily control the lives of his people,
and recklessly execute and slaughter them.
Thus, auspicious matters are honored on the left—
the left, the place of life.
Ominous matters are honored on the right—
the Dao of the dark governs death.
The subordinate general stands on the left—
the subordinate general is lowly and occupies the position of the bright.
The supreme general stands on the right—
the supreme general is exalted and occupies the rightful position,
for he governs death.
This is said in the context of funeral rites.
The supreme general resides on the right,
overseeing funeral rites.
Funeral rites are honored on the right,
for the dead are held in darkness.
When the number of slain is great,
they mourn with sorrow and tears.
When one’s own virtue is thin,
he cannot transform the people through the Dao,
and thus harms the innocent.
When victorious in battle,
he treats it as a funeral rite.
In ancient times, when victorious in battle,
the general would occupy the position of the funeral master,
dressed in plain white garments and weeping.
The wise gentleman values virtue over arms,
and when arms are unavoidable,
he punishes what is inauspicious,
yet his heart does not rejoice in it,
comparing it to a funeral.
Knowing that future generations will not cease from arms,
he mourns and grieves deeply.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Virtue of the Dao**
The Dao is constant and nameless.
The Dao can be dark and bright,
can relax and expand,
can preserve and perish—
thus it has no constant name.
Though simple and unadorned,
the Dao is vast, and the world dare not enslave it.
The Dao is simple yet subtle and formless,
and the world dare not enslave those who embody it.
If lords and kings can uphold it,
all things will come to serve of their own accord.
If lords and kings can uphold the Dao,
all things will naturally submit and follow in virtue’s transformation.
When Heaven and Earth unite,
sweet dew descends—
when the actions of lords and kings align with Heaven and Earth,
Heaven bestows sweet dew and auspicious blessings.
The people need no command,
yet all things are balanced.
When Heaven’s sweet dew and auspicious blessings descend,
no thing needs teaching or ordering,
yet all things naturally adjust in harmony.
The Dao first gives rise to names—
the Dao, which is the Way,
gives rise to named things, the myriad beings.
The Dao is nameless, yet it governs what is named;
formless, yet it governs what is formed.
Once names exist,
all named things have desires and emotions,
rebelling against the Dao and departing from virtue,
thus their bodies are destroyed and dishonored.
Heaven will also come to know of it.
If a person can follow the Dao and cultivate virtue,
Heaven will also come to know of it.
Knowing of it,
this is why there is no peril.
When Heaven knows of it,
its divine clarity aids and protects,
and no longer is there danger or peril.
The Dao in the world is like streams and valleys to the rivers and seas.

The Dao is vast and boundless,
like something submerged or floating,
like something present yet absent,
seen yet not seen,
spoken yet hard to distinguish.

Its influence can be turned left or right.
The Dao can be applied left or right,
adapting to all circumstances.

All things depend upon it to arise,
*[shì]*, meaning they await the Dao to give birth.
Yet the Dao does not refuse or decline.
The Dao does not reject and cease.

Its work accomplished, it does not claim ownership.
Though the Dao possesses virtue,
it does not name itself as such.

It nurtures all things yet does not lord over them.
Though the Dao cherishes and sustains all things,
it does not take as a ruler does.

Constantly without desire,
it may be called small.
The Dao conceals its traces and hides its name,
calmly acting without doing,
seeming faint and insignificant.

Yet all things return to it without being ruled,
all things return to the Dao to receive its *qi*,
yet the Dao does not prohibit like a ruler.

Thus it may be called great.
All things come and go freely,
each acting according to its own nature,
so it may be called the greatest.

Therefore, the sage never claims greatness,
the sage follows the Dao,
conceals virtue and hides its name,
not seeking to fill itself with greatness.

Thus it can achieve true greatness.
The sage leads by embodying the Dao,
acting without words yet transforming,
all matters refined and ordered,
thus it can achieve true greatness.

**Chapter 35: Virtue of Benevolence**
Hold the great symbol,
and the world will follow.
*[zhí]*, meaning to uphold;
*[xiàng]*, meaning the Dao.
When the sage upholds the great Dao,
the world’s people turn their hearts and follow.

Order oneself,
and Heaven grants divine clarity,
moving toward you.
When the sage orders its own being,
Heaven sends its divine light,
coming and going with you.

Coming yet not harming,
peace and tranquility ensue.
All things follow yet are not injured,
so the state becomes secure and attains great peace.

Ordering oneself without harming divine clarity,
the body remains at ease and attains great longevity.
Delight and allure,
passing travelers stop.

*[ĕr]*, meaning beauty;
*[guòkè]*, meaning singularity.
When a person finds beauty in the Dao,
it abides in singularity.
Singularity means to depart from excess and embrace emptiness,
to dwell lightly as a passing traveler.

When the Dao emerges from the mouth,
it is faint and without taste.
The Dao enters and exits through the mouth in faintness,
not like the five flavors—
sour, salty, sweet, bitter, and pungent.

Viewing it, one cannot see it fully.
*[zú]*, meaning attainment.
The Dao is formless,
not like the five colors—
green, yellow, red, white, and black,
which can be fully attained by sight.

Listening to it, one cannot hear it fully.
The Dao is not like the five tones—
*gōng, shāng, jiǎo, zhǐ, yǔ*,
which can be fully attained by hearing.

Using it, it cannot be exhausted.
*[jì]*, meaning completion;
meaning that when the Dao is used to govern the state,
the state becomes wealthy and its people flourish,
when used to order oneself,
longevity extends—
there is no time of exhaustion.

**Chapter 36: Subtle Clarity**
To prepare for contraction,
one must first fully expand;
---

First, expand it fully,
so that its extravagance and excess may reach their height.
When you wish to weaken it,
you must first make it strong;
first strengthen it,
so that it may meet with misfortune and harm.

When you wish to discard it,
you must first elevate it;
elevating it first,
so that its arrogance and excess may reach peril.
When you wish to take it away,
you must first give it.
Giving it first,
so that its prideful desires may be fully indulged.

This is called *Subtle Clarity*.

These four matters—
their Dao is subtle,
yet their effects are clear.

The soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.
The soft and weak endure long,
while the hard and strong perish first.

Fish do not escape from the depths,
but when fish escape from the depths,
it means they have left the hard for the soft,
and cannot be recaptured.

The state’s sharpest tools
should not be shown to the people.
Sharp tools refer to *power*.
Those who wield power in governing the state
should not reveal it to their attending ministers.
Those who practice the Dao of self-cultivation
should not reveal it to those unworthy.

**Chapter 37: Governing with Dao**

The Dao acts without action,
yet nothing remains undone.
The Dao abides in non-action as its constant.
If lords and kings can uphold it,
all things will transform of their own accord.
This means that if lords and kings uphold the Dao,
all things will spontaneously manifest their effects for them.

When transformation begins to stir,
I will restrain it with the uncarved simplicity of the Nameless.
*I* refers to the self.
The *Nameless* refers to the Dao.
When all things manifest their effects for them,
yet still desire to act with artifice and deceit,
lords and kings must restrain them with virtue and Dao.

The uncarved simplicity of the Nameless
will then also not desire to act,
and by not desiring, it remains tranquil.
This means that when lords and kings restrain with virtue and Dao,
the people will also not desire to act,
so they must be transformed through the tranquil Way.

Then the world will spontaneously align itself.
Those who can do this—
the world will spontaneously align and settle.

**Chapter 38: On Virtue**

The highest virtue is non-virtue.
By "highest virtue," it refers to the sovereigns of the primordial age, whose virtue was supreme and nameless.
To say "non-virtue" means they did not govern through virtue but followed nature’s course, nurturing life and destiny without visible intervention.
Thus, they *had* virtue—
for their virtue harmonized with Heaven and Earth, blending with the flowing *qi*, allowing the people to thrive.

The lower virtue is not lost virtue.
By "lower virtue," it refers to sovereigns with titles and posthumous names, whose virtue fell short of the highest.
To say "not lost virtue" means their virtue was visible, their deeds praiseworthy.
Thus, they *lack* virtue—
because they bore names and titles.

The highest virtue does nothing.
This means adhering to the Dao’s tranquil stillness, making no alterations.
Yet it does nothing—
meaning it does not rely on names or titles.

The lower virtue acts.
This means issuing edicts and administering governance.
Yet it does so—
meaning it uses these deeds to claim titles for itself.

The highest benevolence acts.
By "highest benevolence," it refers to sovereigns who practice benevolence, whose virtue is unmatched.
To say "acts" means they enact benevolent kindness.
Yet they do nothing—
for when their deeds are complete, they do not cling to them.

The highest righteousness acts.
This refers to righteousness in punishing harm.
Yet it does so—
meaning they act for personal gain, killing to assert power, taxing the people to sustain themselves.

The highest ritual acts.
By "highest ritual," it refers to sovereigns whose rituals are unmatched.
To say "acts" means they establish ritual institutions and ceremonial order.
Yet none respond—
for ritual flourishes in form while substance decays, its excesses and deceits multiplying, every action straying from the Dao, making response impossible.
Thus, they raise their arms and force compliance—
meaning the burdensome rituals, unanswered, provoke resentment and strife, so they compel obedience by force.

Hence, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises;
when virtue is lost, benevolence appears;
when benevolence is lost, righteousness is enforced;
when righteousness is lost, ritual is imposed.
For ritual is the thinnest layer of loyalty and sincerity—
meaning ritual abandons the root to adorn the branches, so uprightness dwindles while deceit proliferates.

Prescience is the Dao’s superficial bloom, the beginning of folly.
To speak without knowing is prescience.
This is when people lose the Dao in truth but grasp its superficiality—
the first spark of folly and darkness among men.

Thus, the true sage abides in substance,
by "true sage," meaning the sovereign who embodies the Dao.
To "abide in substance" means to dwell in sincerity and simplicity.
They do not abide in superficiality—
meaning they do not indulge in worldly turmoil and excess.
They reside in truth—
meaning they uphold loyalty and sincerity.
They do not reside in superficiality—
meaning they do not prize empty words.
Thus, they discard the latter and embrace the former.

**Chapter 39: The Law of the One**

Those of old who attained the One—
"of old" refers to the past; "the One" is non-action, the child of the Dao.
Heaven attains the One and becomes clear,
Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil—
meaning Heaven, through the One, manifests its luminous forms;
Earth, through the One, remains steadfast and unshaken.

The spirit attains the One and becomes numinous—
meaning the spirit, through the One, transforms without effort.
The valleys attain the One and become full—
meaning the valleys, through the One, remain abundant without depletion.
All things attain the One and thrive—
meaning all things depend on the Dao for their existence.
The lords and kings attain the One to rectify the world—
meaning they, through the One, bring order to the realm.

Yet if they overreach—
"overreach" is a warning—concerning the following six dangers:
Heaven, without clarity, would fear rupture—
meaning Heaven must balance yin and yang, alternating day and night; if it clings only to stillness, it risks fracturing and losing its heavenly nature.

Earth, without tranquility, would fear eruption—
meaning Earth must embrace elevation and depression, hardness and softness, the five phases; if it clings only to stillness, it risks upheaval and losing its earthly nature.

The spirit, without numinosity, would fear exhaustion—
meaning the spirit must cycle through kingship, decline, and decay; if it clings only to vitality, it risks stagnation and losing its divine essence.

The valleys, without fullness, would fear depletion—
meaning the valleys must cycle through abundance and scarcity; if they cling only to fullness, they risk drying up and losing their nourishing nature.

All things, without generation, would fear annihilation—
meaning all things must follow the natural cycles of birth and death; if they cling only to life, they risk extinction and losing their true form.

The lords and kings, without humility, would fear downfall—
meaning they must humble themselves, seek worthy counsel; if they cling only to exaltation, they risk ruin and losing their rule.

Thus, nobility must root itself in humility—
meaning if one seeks true elevation, they must ground it in lowliness.
Like Yu and Shi tilling the fields, Shun molding by the river, the Duke of Zhou dwelling in humble halls—
highness must be built upon lowliness.
For if the foundation is not firm, the structure will inevitably collapse.

Hence, lords and kings call themselves "lonely and few, unworthy of the harvest"—
"lonely and few" signifies solitude; "unworthy of the harvest" signifies they cannot be the hub around which all else revolves.
Is this not the essence of rooting in humility?
They speak thus to enlighten others.
Alas, it is but deceitful speech.

「Thus, gathering countless chariot parts yields no chariot—
*致* (zhi) here means "to gather."
It speaks of how people gather chariot parts—
for the spokes, for the wheels, for the hub, for the axle—
yet none can be called a "chariot" until they are assembled.
This illustrates how lords and kings, by not claiming exalted titles,
can thereby achieve true nobility.

They do not wish to be polished like jade,
nor stark like stone.
*碌碌* (luoluo) signifies scarcity;
*落落* (luoluo) signifies abundance.
Jade is scarce, hence its value;
stone is plentiful, hence its lowliness.
It speaks of how people should not seek to be prized like jade,
nor despised like stone,
but rather dwell in moderation.

**Dao/Way’s Movement (反者道之动)**
*反* (fan) here means "root" or "origin."
The root is what makes the Dao/Way move—
movement generates all things;
to go against it is to perish.
The Dao/Way’s use is in weakness.

The soft and yielding are what the Dao/Way habitually employs,
and thus they endure.
All things under heaven are born from what is present—
things arise from the forms and positions of heaven and earth,
so it is said they are born from what is present.
Yet what is present is born from what is absent.

Heaven and earth, divine and luminous,
the *蜎* (ying) flying, the *蠕* (ru) crawling—
all arise from the Dao/Way.
The Dao/Way is formless, hence it is said they are born from what is absent.

This speaks of how the root surpasses the flourish,
the weak surpass the strong,
and humility surpasses fullness.

**Hearing the Dao/Way (同异第四十一)**
The superior person hears the Dao/Way
and strives diligently to practice it.
The middle person hears the Dao/Way
and clings to it, yet falters—
they strive to cultivate themselves for long life,
to govern their state for lasting peace,
and take pleasure in its teachings.
But when they encounter wealth, desire, honor, or glory,
they are bewildered by their passions
and thus lose it again.
The inferior person hears the Dao/Way
and laughs at it.
The inferior are greedy, cruel, and filled with desires;
they see the Dao/Way’s softness and call it fearsome.
They see its plainness and call it vulgar.
Thus, they laugh at it.

If one does not laugh at it,
it is not worthy to be called the Dao/Way.
If the Dao/Way is not laughed at by the inferior,
it is not yet fully the Dao/Way.
Hence, I set forth these sayings:

The bright Dao/Way seems dim,
the advancing Dao/Way seems to retreat,
the smooth Dao/Way seems crooked.
The superior in virtue seems like a deep valley,
the great purity seems like a stain,
the vast virtue seems insufficient,
the established virtue seems hollow.
The truthful seem false,
the upright seem misaligned,
the great instrument takes long to mature,
the great sound is rare in voice,
the great image is formless,
the Dao/Way is hidden, nameless.

Only the Dao/Way
is good at lending and completing.
*成* (cheng) here means "to fulfill."
It speaks of how the Dao/Way is good at bestowing upon people
their vital *qi* and bringing them to completion.

**The Transformations of the Dao/Way (道化第四十二)**
The Dao/Way first generates *一* (yi),
the primal unity.
*一* (yi) generates *二* (er),
the duality of yin and yang.
*二* (er) generates *三* (san),
the three *qi* of harmony, clarity, and turbidity,
which divide into heaven, earth, and humanity.
*三* (san) generates all things.
Heaven and earth, humanity together generate all things.

Heaven bestows, earth transforms,
and humanity nurtures them.
All things bear yin and embrace yang,
turning toward the sun as they revolve.
The *冲气* (chongqi) of harmony pervades them all—
within all things lies the primal *qi*,
and when harmonized and softened,
it is like marrow in bones,
or the void within grasses and trees.
The *qi* of harmony flows silently,
and thus they attain longevity.

What people detest
is the "lonely and few, unworthy of the harvest,"
yet lords and kings take it as their name.
"Lonely and few, unworthy of the harvest"
is an ill-omened title,
yet lords and kings adopt it,
dwelling in humility,
embodying emptiness, harmony, and softness.
Thus, some things are diminished yet gain,
some are drawn yet cannot be held,
some are pushed yet return.
Some gain yet are diminished.

He who raises himself too high invites collapse,
he who covets wealth and honor invites calamity.
What people are taught
is to abandon the weak for the strong,
to abandon the soft for the hard.
I also teach this—
I teach people to abandon the strong for the weak,
to abandon the hard for the soft.

The rigid and forceful
do not meet a natural death.
The rigid and forceful
do not believe in the mysterious and profound,
they betray morality,
do not follow the teachings,
but rely on power and strength.
It is said they do not meet a natural death—
they are cut off by heaven,
slain by weapons,
executed by law,
and do not die by the full span of their years.
I shall take them as my first lesson.

**The Dao/Way’s Partial Use (偏用第四十三)**
The utmost softness under heaven
overcomes the utmost hardness under heaven.
The utmost softness is water,
the utmost hardness is metal and stone.
Water can penetrate hardness,
enter rigidity—
nothing it cannot pass through.
There is nothing it cannot enter without gap.

It is said there is nothing it cannot enter—
this is the Dao/Way.
The Dao/Way has no form or substance,
and thus can move freely without obstruction,
penetrating the divine and luminous,
benefiting all living things.
Thus, I know the benefits of *无为* (wuwei).

I see how the Dao/Way’s *wuwei*
yet all things transform and complete themselves—
thus I know the benefits of *wuwei* for humanity.

---

**The Dao/Way’s Silent Instruction (不言之教)**
By law of the Dao/Way, that which is not spoken#11,
the teacher applies it to oneself.

The benefits of *wuwei* are such:
by law of the Dao/Way’s *wuwei*,
governing the body brings benefit to **spirit/qi**,
governing the state brings benefit to all the people—
without toil or vexation.

Few under heaven can attain this.

The world, its ruler is humanity.
If few can attain the Dao/Way’s *wuwei*,
then *wuwei* governance is both of body and state.

**Establishing Precepts (立戒第四十四)**
Which is more dear to you, name or body?
If name follows body, it must decline.
Which is more abundant, body or wealth?
If wealth is abundant, it harms the body.
Which is more painful, gain or loss?
If one clings to profit, one’s actions will falter.

Excessive love brings great cost.
Excessive love of beauty wastes **spirit/qi**,
excessive love of wealth invites calamity.
What is loved is little, what is lost is much—
thus it is said that great cost arises.
Excessive hoarding brings great loss.
The living hoard in treasuries,
the dead hoard in tombs.
The living face fears of plunder and assault,
the dead face fears of desecration and neglect.

Knowing contentment brings no disgrace,
the contented one cuts off profit and desire—
no disgrace befalls the body.

Knowing restraint brings no peril,
he who knows when to stop must stop,
then wealth and profit do not weigh upon the body and mind,
sensual pleasures do not disturb the ears and eyes—
thus he remains throughout life unthreatened,
able to endure.

If humanity can know to stop at contentment,
then fortune and blessings are within themselves.
He who governs his body does not weary **spirit/qi**,
he who governs his state does not trouble the people—
thus he can endure long.

**Abundant Virtue/Power (洪德第四十五)**
Great virtue/power, though complete, seems deficient.
This refers to a sovereign of great Dao/virtue/power:
though complete, he hides his name and renown,
as if destroyed or incomplete.
His governance knows no exhaustion—
when his heart is thus, there is no time when virtue/power is spent.

Great fullness seems empty.
This refers to a sovereign of great Dao/virtue/power, overflowing with abundance:
though full, he does not dare to be arrogant in his high rank,
though rich, he does not dare to be extravagant.
His governance knows no depletion—
when his heart is thus, there is no time when virtue/power is exhausted.

Great rectitude seems bent.
Great rectitude refers to one who follows the Dao/Way’s laws and precepts with perfect uprightness.
Though bent, he does not contend with the common folk,
as if he could be bent and folded.

Great cleverness seems clumsy.
Great cleverness refers to one with many talents and skills.
Though clumsy, he does not dare to show his abilities.

Great eloquence seems inarticulate.
Great eloquence refers to one whose wisdom is unquestionable.
Though inarticulate, his speech is without words.

Excessive vigor overcomes coldness—
*vigor*, here, means extreme.

Spring and summer, the **yang qi** is restless and swift above,
all things flourish and grow vast.
When it reaches its extreme, coldness follows—
coldness brings withering and scattering to ruin,
a warning that one must not be overly rigid and restless.

**Calmness overcomes heat**—
in autumn and winter, all things rest beneath the Yellow Springs.
When it reaches its extreme, heat arises—
heat is the source of life’s vitality.
**Clarity and stillness** establish the **Dao/Way** as the standard for the world.
If one can be clear and still,
then one becomes the leader of the world,
and holding to this standard knows no end.

**Frugality** (the forty-sixth) —
When the ruler follows the **Dao/Way**,
he uses **walking horses** to fertilize the fields;
*fertilize*, here, means **cultivating the soil**.
He does not employ arms,
but uses **walking horses** to tend the farmlands.
One who governs himself **restrains his yang essence**,
using it to **fertilize his own body**.

When the ruler does not follow the **Dao/Way**,
**walking horses** breed in the suburbs.
Warfare never ceases,
and **walking horses** multiply in the borderlands,
never returning home.
No crime is greater than **excessive desire**,
for lustful indulgence.
No calamity is greater than **not knowing contentment**,
for the rich and noble cannot restrain themselves.
No fault is greater than **greed for gain**,
desiring wealth, influence, and profit.
Thus, **contentment’s root is contentment itself**—
**true contentment** lies in guarding the **original essence**.
Always content,
meaning **without desire at all**.

**Reflecting from afar** (the forty-seventh) —
Without leaving his door, he knows the world;
the sage does not need to leave his door to know the world,
for he understands it by knowing the **human body** through his own,
and **human families** through his own.
Thus he perceives the world.
Without peering through windows, he beholds **Heaven’s Dao/Way**.
**Heaven’s Dao/Way** and **human Dao/Way** are alike—
**Heaven** and **humanity** are in harmony,
their **refined qi** interpenetrating.
When the ruler is clear and still,
**Heaven’s qi** naturally aligns.
When the ruler is excessive in desire,
**Heaven’s qi** becomes troubled and murky.
**Fortune, misfortune, benefit, and harm** all arise from within.
The farther he goes,
the less he knows.
Meaning: when he leaves his own home to observe others,
or his own body to observe others’,
the more distant his gaze,
the less he truly sees.
Thus the sage knows without traveling—
the sage neither ascends to **Heaven** nor descends into the depths,
yet knows the world through his **heart**.
He names without seeing—
when the ruler above values **Dao/Way**, those below value **virtue/power**;
when the ruler above values **martial might**, those below value **strength**.
The sage discerns the small to grasp the great,
and examines the inner to comprehend the outer.

**Achievement through non-action** —
The sage acts without striving.
When the ruler above favors **non-action** (*wuwei*),
those below have no need for exertion,
families are well-provided, and people are content—
all things transform naturally.

**Forgetting knowledge** (the forty-eighth) —
To study daily is to increase;
*study*, here, refers to **governance, teaching, rituals, and music**.
To **increase daily** means **refining emotions, desires, and artificial adornments** grow ever more plentiful.
To follow the **Dao/Way** daily is to diminish.
The **Dao/Way** refers to **natural spontaneity**.
To **diminish daily** means **refining emotions, desires, and artificial adornments** are gradually worn away.
**Diminish again and again**—
*diminish*, here, means **eradicating desires**.
**Again and again** refers to **gradually removing them**.
Until he reaches **non-action**—
when he is **serene and simple**, like an infant,
**creating nothing artificially**.
**Non-action yet nothing remains undone**—
when desires are severed and **virtue/power** aligns with the **Dao/Way**,
he accomplishes all without effort.
To **govern the world**, one must act with **non-interference**—
*govern*, here, means **to rule**.
Ruling the world should be done with **non-interference**,
not with labor and disturbance.
Once **interference** arises,
one cannot rule the world.
When one **loves interference**,
governance grows troubled,
and the people are restless—
thus it is insufficient for ruling the world.

**Entrusting to virtue** (the forty-ninth) —
The sage has no fixed heart,
meaning the sage **values transformation and adaptation**,
**follows natural progression**,
as if **without a settled intention**.
He takes the **hundred folk’s heart** as his own.
Whatever benefits the **hundred folk**,
he follows accordingly.
If they are **good**, I **nurture their goodness**—
when the **hundred folk** act well,
the sage **reinforces their virtue**.
If they are **not good**, I **also nurture their goodness**—
though the **hundred folk** may have those who are **not good**,
the sage **transforms them** until they become good.
**Virtue is thus cultivated**.
When the **hundred folk’s virtue** is transformed,
the sage **acts with goodness**.

If they are **faithful**, I **affirm their faithfulness**—
when the **hundred folk** act faithfully,
the sage **reinforces their trustworthiness**.
If they are **not faithful**, I **also affirm their faithfulness**—
though the **hundred folk** may have those who are **not faithful**,
the sage **transforms them** until they become faithful.
**Virtue is thus trustworthy**.
When the **hundred folk’s virtue** is transformed,
the sage **acts with trust**.

The sage in the world is **solemn and cautious**—
the sage in the world is **solemn and cautious**,
always fearing **wealth and nobility**,
never daring to be **arrogant or extravagant**.
He **muddles the world’s heart**—
meaning the sage **clouds the hearts of the hundred folk**,
as if they were **simple and unknowing**.
The **hundred folk** all **fix their ears and eyes** upon him—
*fix*, here, means **to rely on**.
The **hundred folk** all **rely on his ears and eyes** as their **vision and hearing**.
The sage **treats them like infants**—
the sage **cherishes and nurtures the hundred folk** as if they were **babies or young children**,
**cultivating them without expectation of reward**.

**Valuing life** (the fiftieth) —
**Birth and death** are intertwined,

**Birth** refers to when **emotions and desires arise from the five viscera**—
when the **hun** is steadfast and the **po** is tranquil, thus **life** emerges.

**Death** refers to when **emotions and desires sink into the chest and abdomen**—
when **spirit and essence** grow weary and confused, thus **death** comes.

There are **thirteen paths to life**,
and **thirteen paths to death**—
meaning the **kinds of birth and death** each number thirteen,
namely the **nine orifices and four gates**.

In **life**, the eyes do not gaze wantonly,
the ears do not listen indiscriminately,
the nose does not indulge in foul or fragrant odors,
the mouth does not speak or taste recklessly,
the hands do not grasp at will,
the feet do not move arbitrarily,
and the **essence** is not wasted.

In **death**, the opposite holds true.

**Thirteen actions** lead a person to **death’s domain**—
but when one **seeks life**, those same actions, reversed, become **thirteen paths to death**.

Why is this?
*—Why do these actions lead to death’s domain?*
Because **life’s excess** is too great.

The reason these actions lead to death’s domain
is that **seeking life is too extreme**—
it **contradicts the Dao** and **defies Heaven**,
acting recklessly against oneself.

Now, those who **master life-nurturing**—
*—s摄 here means "to nourish."*
—**walk on land** and **avoid rhinoceros and tigers**,
naturally keeping far from harm.

They **enter battle** without armor or weapons,
*—not favoring war or killing.*
The rhinoceros has no place to strike with its horn,
the tiger no place to strike with its claws,
and weapons no place to strike with their blades.

Those who **nurture life**—
tigers and rhinoceros find no way to harm them,
and blades have no means to strike.

Why is this?
*—Why do tigers, rhinoceros, and weapons not harm them?*
Because they **avoid death’s domain**—
because they **do not violate the thirteen paths to death**.
*—Meaning the **spirit and clarity** protect them,
and tigers, rhinoceros, and weapons dare not harm.*

**Virtue-Nurturing (the fifty-first)**—
The **Dao** gives birth to **virtue**,

The **Dao** gives birth to myriad things.
**Virtue** nurtures them—**virtue** is singular.
The singular **Dao** distributes **qi** to all,
and **virtue** nourishes and sustains them.
It shapes their forms—
the singular **Dao** establishes shapes and likenesses for all things.
It forms their conditions—
the singular **Dao** creates the forces of cold and heat to bring them to fulfillment.
Thus, all things without fail revere the **Dao** and hold **virtue** in high esteem.
Whatever **Dao** and **virtue** accomplish,
all things respond with awe and reverence.
The **Dao’s** grandeur, **virtue’s** nobility—
no summons is made, yet they ever act naturally.
The **Dao** does not call upon myriad things,
yet they always respond naturally, like the echo of a sound.
Hence, the **Dao** gives birth to them,
**virtue** nurtures them,
lengthens and fosters them,
fulfills and matures them,
covers and protects them.
The **Dao** does not merely give birth to myriad things—
it also lengthens, nurtures, fulfills, matures,
and covers to preserve their nature and life.
When a ruler governs a state or cultivates oneself,
one should act likewise.
To give birth without possession—
the **Dao** gives birth to myriad things,
yet does not claim ownership for its own use.
To act without reliance—
the **Dao’s** deeds are not done to demand reward.
To lengthen without slaughter—
the **Dao** lengthens and nurtures myriad things,
yet does not slaughter or harm for its own gain.
This is called **Mysterious Virtue**.
The **Dao’s** actions are **en** and **virtue**,
yet their mystery is dark and unseen.
—**Returning to the Root (the fifty-second)**

The world has a beginning,
and that beginning is the **Dao**.
The **Dao** is called the "mother of the world."
Since one knows its mother,
one must also know its child;
the child is singular.
Having known the **Dao**,
one must also guard it.
Having known the singular,
one must also guard the **Dao**,
returning to non-action.
Thus, one’s life is not endangered.
One’s body does not perish.
Close its **dui**—
**Dui**, the eyes.
Do not gaze recklessly.
Shut its **men**—
**Men**, the mouth.
Do not speak recklessly.
Then, one’s life is not labored.
Open its **dui**—
open the eyes,
to discern desires.
Fulfill its affairs—
**Jì**, to benefit.
Benefit the desires.
Then, one’s life is not in peril.
Calamity and chaos arise.
To see the small is called **clarity**—
when sprouts first appear, unseen,
calamity and chaos have not yet manifested,
yet one alone discerns them—this is **clarity**.
To guard the soft is called **strength**—
to guard softness and weakness is to strengthen greatness.
To use its light—
to employ the eyes’ light outward,
to discern the world’s benefits and harms.
Then, return to its **clarity**—
meaning to restore the light inward,
so that the **spirit** does not leak away.
No calamity befalls the body—
by inwardly preserving the **spirit**,
one avoids losses.
This is called **Habitual Practice**.
If a person can act thus,
it is called **practicing and habituating the Way**.
—**Benefiting Proof (the fifty-third)**

"Let me be clearly aware of governance,
and I shall follow the great **Dao**."
**Jie**, the great.
Laozi lamented that the rulers of his age did not follow the great **Dao**,
so he spoke: "If I were clearly aware of governance,
I would follow the great **Dao**,
personally embodying the transformation of non-action."
Only fearing action is dread.
**Yòu**, alone.
Alone fearing the loss of **Dao** through action.
To reward the good, one fears **false goodness** arises,
to trust the loyal, one fears **deceitful loyalty** emerges.
The great **Dao** is most even,
**yí**, plain and easy.

「Yet the people love crooked paths.
Crooked paths—unrighteous, not upright or just—
though the great Dao is most plain and easy,
the people prefer to follow these crooked paths.

The court is most extravagant,
with towering pavilions and grand halls,
palaces and chambers adorned.
Fields lie most untended,
agriculture neglected,
plowing and tilling forsaken while seasons pass.
Granaries lie most empty,
grains spoiled and wasted,
the nation lacks provision.

They adorn themselves in fine embroidery,
pursue ornate pretense,
value outward splendor.
They wear sharp blades,
praise strength and vigor,
pursue martial prowess and wasteful excess.
They glut themselves with food and drink,
wealth overflowing,
desires insatiable,
yet never content—
this is called **deceptive display**.

When the common folk lack while the ruler has excess,
it is due to **plunder and theft**.
In **deceptive display**, one flaunts attire and conduct,
unaware that death may come,
families may crumble,
and kin may perish along with them.
**Deceptive display** is not the Dao, is it?

If a ruler acts thus,
this is not the Dao.
The words *"is it not?"* are an expression of lament.

—**Habitual Practice (the fifty-fourth)**

**Established virtue does not falter**,
*Established*—to stand firm.
Virtue established through the Dao in one’s person and nation
cannot be shaken or uprooted.

**Embraced virtue does not depart**,
Virtue embraced through the Dao in spirit and qi
will never be abandoned or released.

Their descendants’ sacrifices will never cease.
If a person’s descendants practice the Dao thus,
they achieve **long life without death**,
enduring through generations,
their ancestral temples never without offerings.

Practiced in the person,
its **virtue/power** becomes true;
Practiced in the person, the Dao
nurtures **qi** and preserves the **spirit**,
extending life and prolonging years.
If its **virtue/power** is such,
then one becomes a **True Person**.

Practiced in the family,
its **virtue/power** overflows;
Practiced in the family, the Dao
brings forth a father’s tenderness and a son’s filial piety,
a brother’s kindness and a younger sibling’s obedience,
a husband’s trust and a wife’s rectitude.
If its **virtue/power** is such,
then blessings abound for future generations.

Practiced in the village,
its **virtue/power** grows long;
Practiced in the village, the Dao
honors and respects the elders,
loves and nurtures the young,
and instructs the foolish and ignorant.
If its **virtue/power** is such,
then none are left uncovered by its influence.

Practiced in the state,
its **virtue/power** becomes abundant;
Practiced in the state, the Dao
makes the ruler **sage-like** and ministers **loyal**,
**ren** and **yi** arise naturally,
rituals and music flourish of their own accord,
governance is smooth without effort.
If its **virtue/power** is such,
then its blessings are plentiful.

Practiced throughout the world,
its **virtue/power** becomes universal.
A ruler who practices the Dao throughout the world
acts without speaking, governs without teaching,
and the people respond as shadows follow their forms.
If its **virtue/power** is such,
then it may be called **universal and broad**.

Thus, observing the person with the person,
one observes a **Dao-practicing** person against a **non-Dao-practicing** person—
who perishes, who survives?

Observing the family with the family,
one observes a **Dao-practicing** family against a **non-Dao-practicing** family.

Observing the village with the village,
one observes a **Dao-practicing** village against a **non-Dao-practicing** village.

Observing the state with the state,
one observes a **Dao-practicing** state against a **non-Dao-practicing** state.

Observing the world with the world,
one observes a **Dao-practicing** ruler against a **non-Dao-practicing** ruler.
How do I know this to be so?
By this.

Laozi spoke: *"How do I know the world thrives when the Dao is practiced,
and declines when the Dao is abandoned?"*
By observing these five matters, one knows it.

—**Mysterious Correspondence (the fifty-fifth)**

The depth of **virtue/power** that is contained,
*Contained*—the richness of virtue held within.
Like an infant.

The **spirit** and **clarity** protect and bless those who contain virtue,
as parents cherish an infant.

Venomous creatures do not sting,
bees and wasps, snakes and insects—
none sting.
Fierce beasts do not seize,
raptors do not strike.
An infant is not harmed by things,
things do not harm it.
Thus, in the **Great Peace** era,
people, regardless of rank,
all possess **ren** hearts.
Thorny things return to their source;
venomous creatures do not harm people.
Though bones are weak and sinews are soft,
its grip is firm—
an infant’s sinews and bones are soft and weak,
yet it holds things with unyielding strength,
for its intent is focused and its heart does not stray.

It does not know the joining of male and female yet grows fierce,
the peak of **essence**.
An infant, unaware of male-female union,
yet its **yin** rises in anger—
this is due to the abundance of **essence-qi**.

It cries all day yet its throat does not grow hoarse,
the utmost **harmony**.
An infant, from morning till evening,
cries without ceasing,
its voice unchanging—
this is due to the abundance of **harmonious qi**.

To know **harmony** is to know the **constant Dao**,
*Constant*—ever-present, unchanging.
If a person knows the **harmonious qi**’s softness and benefit,
then they understand the Dao’s constancy.

To know the **constant Dao** is to know **clarity**,
*Clarity*—enlightenment, insight.
If a person knows and follows the Dao’s constancy,
then day by day they attain **clarity** in its mysteries.

**Beneficial life** is called **auspicious**,
*Auspicious*—the Dao’s blessing.
Speaking of life that grows evermore,
day by day expanding and strengthening.
The heart directs **qi**—this is called **strength**.
If the heart is focused, gentle, and harmonious,
**qi** and **spirit** are firmly rooted within,
so the form is soft.
But if the heart instead allows **false desires** to act,
then **harmonious qi** departs from the center,
and the form grows evermore **rigid and strong**.

—**Mysterious Virtue (the fifty-sixth)**

Things grow strong then age,
this is called **not the Dao**.
When all things reach their peak of vigor,
they wither and grow old—
old, they cannot attain the Dao.

**Not the Dao** leads to early decline.
Those who do not attain the Dao
die young.

The wise do not speak,
the wise value **practicing the Dao** over words.
The talkative lack wisdom,
many words bring many troubles—
four horses cannot outrun the tongue.

Block its **mouth**,
close its **gate**,
*Block*—to stop at the source.
*Close*—to shut the door.
To **block** and **close** is to sever its origin.

Dull its sharpness,
when desires are keen,
one should reflect on the Dao’s **non-action** to blunt them.

Loosen its tangles,
*tangles*—knots of grudges that never unwind.
One should reflect on the Dao’s **simplicity** to unravel them.

Harmonize its brightness,
though one may have solitary insight,
one should harmonize it to prevent dazzlement.
Equalize its dust,
one should not distinguish oneself.
This is called **mysterious unity**.
*Mysterious*—heavenly, profound.
If a person can act thus,
this is called **aligning with Heaven’s Dao**.

Thus, it cannot be **close**,
not delighting in honor and glory,
yet standing firm in sorrow.
Nor can it be **distant**;
*Distant*—detached, estranged.
With **calm intent** and **no desires**,
one bears no grudges against others.

The Way cannot be grasped for **gain**—
the body does not crave wealth and rank,
the palate does not lust after the five flavors.

Nor can it be grasped for **harm**—
it does not contend with the greedy for profit,
nor does it vie with the bold for strength.

It cannot be made **exalted**—
it does not serve as a ruler in chaotic times,
nor does it occupy a position under a tyrannical lord.

Nor can it be made **lowly**—
it does not grow arrogant through power,
nor does it bow its will in defeat.

Thus, it is **noble beyond the world**.
Its virtue is such that
kings cannot make it their subject,
lords cannot bend it to their will.
It floats with the world, rising and falling,
preserving itself while avoiding harm—
thus, it is **noble beyond the world**.

To govern the realm with **rectitude**—
*rectitude*, the utmost.
Heaven appoints those of upright conduct
to rule with perfect governance.

To wage war with **strategy**—
*strategy*, deceit.
Heaven appoints those skilled in guile
to command the armies.

To seize the world through **non-action**—
Heaven entrusts those who act with effortless ease
to rule the world as its sovereign.

How do I know the world is thus?
By this—
*this*, the present.
Laozi said:
How do I know Heaven’s intent is so?
By what is seen today.

**Pure Wind**, the Fifty-Seventh.

The world abounds in taboos and prohibitions,
yet the people grow ever poorer.
The world speaks of the sovereign.
Taboos are restrictions and bans.
Too many decrees breed deceit,
too many prohibitions spawn guile below—
thus, mutual harm and poverty arise.

The people multiply clever tools,
and the state grows ever more confused.
Clever tools are *power* and influence.
When the people wield too much power,
those who watch grow dazzled by sight,
those who listen grow bewildered by sound—
superior and inferior grow estranged,
and thus the state falls into chaos.

The people multiply in skill and artifice,
and strange adornments flourish.
The people speak of the ruler and the great lords.
Multiplying in skill means carving palaces and halls,
engraving robes and adornments.
Strange adornments grow ever more extravagant—
those below emulate those above,
decorating with gold and jade,
embroidering with silk and dyes,
ever more excessive each day.

Fine and desirable things grow ever more prominent,
and thieves and robbers multiply.
Fine and desirable things are luxuries.
When luxuries flourish and are displayed openly,
farming is neglected,
hunger and cold draw near—
thus, thieves and robbers multiply.

Therefore, the Sage says:
*"I act with non-action, and the people transform themselves.*
The Sage speaks: *I cultivate the Dao and align with Heaven,
making no alterations or innovations,
yet the people transform themselves naturally.*

*I love stillness, and the people become upright.*
The Sage speaks: *I cherish tranquility,
speaking not, teaching not,
yet the people all become loyal and true.*

*I engage in no affairs, and the people grow rich.*
Without forced labor or conscription,
the people settle into their work—
thus, they all grow rich.

*I desire nothing, and the people return to simplicity.*
I constantly desire nothing,
rejecting ornamentation and finery,
wearing modest attire—
the people follow my simplicity.

*I abandon emotions, and the people grow pure.*
The Sage speaks: *I cultivate the Dao and uphold the True,
severing the Six Emotions,
and the people follow my purity."*

**Pure Transformation, the Fifty-Eighth**
Its governance is—

**Pure Transformation, the Fifty-Eighth**
Its governance is—
vast and profound, obscure yet dim,
as if without clarity.
Its people are pure and refined.

When governance is vast and profound,
the people become pure and refined,
rich and harmonious,
living in mutual affection.

When governance is meticulous and probing,
its teachings are swift and hidden—
words decided by the mouth,
hearings decided by the ear.
Its people grow weary and depleted.
When teachings are hasty and oppressive,
the people struggle to survive,
thus growing weary and depleted day by day.

Calamity! It is the foundation of fortune.
*Foundation* means *origin*.
When fortune arises from calamity,
those who encounter calamity repent their errors,
blame themselves,
and cultivate virtuous conduct along the Dao—
then calamity departs and fortune arrives.

Fortune! It is the seedbed of calamity.
Calamity lies hidden within fortune.
When one obtains fortune and becomes arrogant and licentious,
fortune departs and calamity arrives.

Who knows its limits?
Calamity and fortune generate each other—
who can know their ultimate end?

When the ruler lacks rectitude,
*lack* means *not*.
It means the ruler does not rectify himself—
then the state will perish.

Rectitude returns as deceit.
*Deceit* means *craftiness*.
When the ruler lacks rectitude,
even rectitude transforms beneath him into craftiness.

Virtue returns as hypocrisy.
Virtuous men all transform above into hypocritical omens.

The people’s confusion is long-standing.
It speaks of the ruler’s delusion and loss of rectitude
having endured for many days.

Thus the Sage is square yet does not cut,
The Sage practices rectitude to guide the people,
not to sever them.

He is frugal yet does not harm,
The Sage’s frugality is pure,
seeking to transform the people,
not to injure them.
Yet now it is not so—
rectifying oneself to harm others.

He is upright yet does not flaunt,
*Flaunt* means *proclaim*.
Though the Sage is upright,
he bends himself to others,
not proclaiming himself.

He shines yet does not dazzle.
Though the Sage possesses singular insight,
he remains as if dim,
not dazzling others with brilliance.

**Guarding the Dao, the Fifty-Ninth**
**Govern the People**
The ruler who governs the people
should serve the Dao of Heaven,
following the Four Seasons.

Nothing surpasses frugality.
*Frugality* means *love*.
The ruler who governs the state must love the people’s resources,
not indulging in extravagance.
The ruler who governs himself must love his vital essence,
not indulging in dissipation.

Only through frugality
does one attain early mastery.
*Early* means *prior*.
*Mastery* means *attainment*.
To love the people’s resources and vital essence alone
is to first attain the Dao of Heaven.

Early mastery is called accumulating virtue.
To first attain the Dao of Heaven
is to accumulate virtue within oneself.
Accumulating virtue means nothing remains unconquered.
*Conquer* means *overcome*.
To accumulate virtue within oneself
is to overcome all.
To overcome all means none know its limits.
To overcome all without limits
is to possess the state.
To possess the state without limits
is to endure long.
The state and the body are the same.
*Mother* refers to the Dao.
If one preserves the Dao within the body,
so that vital essence is not exhausted
and the Five Spirits are not tormented,
then one may endure long.

This is called deep roots and firm foundations.
If one takes *qi* as root and essence as foundation,
like a tree—if roots are not deep, it will be uprooted;
if the foundation is not firm, it will fall—
it speaks of deeply guarding one’s *qi*
and firmly preserving one’s essence,
so that none may leak away.

This is the Dao of longevity and enduring vision.
Those with deep roots and firm foundations
embody the Dao of longevity and enduring vision.

「Chapter Four of the *Zhuang* of the *Dao De Jing*: Master Hu Shang’s Commentary

**Section 60: Governing a Great State**

To govern a great state as one would cook a small fish—
*Fish* refers to the people. When cooking a small fish,
one does not remove its entrails,
does not strip its scales,
does not dare to prod it,
for fear it will spoil.

If governance is burdensome, the people will fall into chaos;
If self-cultivation is burdensome, the vital essence will scatter.

To apply the Dao to the world,
its spirits will not act with malevolence.

To govern the world with the *Dao* and *virtue* in one’s station,
then the spirits will not dare to confront one’s *spirit* (shén) and harm the people#1.

It is not their inherent *spirit* (shén) that harms people—
Nor does the Sage harm people.

Only those lacking *Dao* and *virtue* can harm people.
When the Sage holds office,
they dare not harm people,
thus the spirits do not dare interfere with humanity.

When two do not harm each other,
the people are preserved in the *Yang*,
the spirits are preserved in the *Yin*,
humanity’s life and nature are kept whole,
the spirits preserve their own *spirit* (shén).
Thus, they return to their proper exchange.

**Section 61: Humble Virtue**

A great state is like the flow of water below—」

「To govern a great state as the rivers and seas flow downward,
it does not resist the smallest currents.
The world’s convergence rests in great states,
where the world’s people gather and assemble.

The world’s *yin*—
*Yin* is the category of the receptive.
Soft, humble, yielding, yet not aggressive.
*Yin* always overcomes *yang* through stillness,
for the female bends beneath the male,
*yin* triumphs over *yang*#2,
by remaining tranquil and never seeking first.

To be still is to be lowly.
The *Dao* of *yin* brings stability.
Thus, when a great state humbles itself before small states,
it takes them;
when it remains humble and yielding,
it keeps them.
When a small state humbles itself before a great state,
it is gathered under it.
This shows that states, great or small,
if they grasp humility and nurture others,
will never err.

Thus, sometimes one humbles to take,
sometimes to gather.
To humble means for the great state to yield to the small,
and for the small state to yield to the great,
each taking what is rightfully theirs.
The great state seeks only to encompass and nurture others.
If the great state does not lose its humility,
it will swallow and tend to the small states.
The small state seeks only to serve others,
to become their subjects and servants.
When both obtain what they desire,
the greater should indeed humble itself.
The great state and the small state each seek what they desire,
but the great state should especially humble itself.

**Section 62: The Way**

The *Dao* is the hidden essence of all things—
*Essence*, meaning what is stored within.
The *Dao* as the hidden storehouse of all things,
contains all without exclusion.

The treasure of the virtuous,
the virtuous use the *Dao* as their personal treasure,
daring not to defy it.
The refuge of the unvirtuous,
the *Dao* is the unvirtuous’ support and reliance.
Even in calamity or urgency,
they may yet know to repent, humble, and yield.

Fine words can be sold—
Fine words can be sold: in trade, one exchanges and withdraws,
but does not persist in selling virtuous speech or sweet words.
The buyer desires swift acquisition,
the seller desires swift sale.
Noble conduct can be bestowed upon others.
*Bestow*, meaning to distinguish.
When a person’s conduct is noble and distinguished,
it is not yet sufficient to honor the *Dao*.
What should one discard of those who are unvirtuous?
Even the unvirtuous should be transformed by the *Dao*.
Before the Three Sovereigns, there were no abandoned people—
their virtue and transformation were pure.
Thus, when establishing a Son of Heaven and the Three Ministers,
it is to teach and transform the unvirtuous.
Even if one presents a jade tablet before four horses,
it is not as good as sitting and offering this *Dao*.
Even if one presents fine jade with four horses,
it is not as good as sitting and offering this *Dao*.
Why did the ancients value this *Dao* so highly?
Why not seek it daily to obtain it?
The ancients valued this *Dao* not by daily distant journeys to seek it,
but by finding it close within oneself.
Can it free one from guilt?
*Guilt* refers to those in chaotic times,
under tyrannical rulers who unjustly mete out punishment—
practicing the *Dao* can dissolve death’s peril,
saving one from the masses.
Thus, it is held in highest esteem by the world.

The *Dao* and *virtue* are profound and far-reaching,
covering and aiding all without exception,
preserving the self and governing the state,
serene and effortless—
thus, it can be held in highest esteem by the world.

**Section 63: The Beginning of Grace**

To act without action,」

「因成修故，无所改作。
To act in accordance with what is already formed, without alteration or fabrication.

事无事，
*Qi* without *qi*—
预设备，除烦省事。

profound contemplation and far-reaching foresight reveal its true essence.

these are the precepts and injunctions to be observed.

为大於其细。
To achieve the grand from the minute—
欲为大事，
if one seeks to accomplish great deeds,

for calamities arise from the small.

天下难事必作於易，
the most difficult tasks must be undertaken when they are still easy;
天下大事必作於细，
the greatest undertakings must begin with the slightest efforts.

是以大人终不为大，
thus, the great sage never seeks to do great things—
处谦虚也。
he remains in humility and modesty;
故能成其大。
therefore, he achieves true greatness.

天下共归之也。
All under heaven willingly submit to him.

夫轻诺必寡信，
he who makes light promises will rarely be trusted—
不重言也。
for he does not take his words seriously.

多易必多难。
What is overly facile will inevitably lead to many hardships—
不慎患也。
for he does not guard against misfortune.

是以圣人犹难之，
thus, the sage still regards difficulty as such—
圣人动作举事，
when he acts or undertakes matters,
犹进退重难之，
he weighs the forward and backward steps with grave deliberation,
欲塞其故源也。
seeking to block its origins.

故终无难。
Therefore, he ultimately faces no difficulty.

圣人终身无患难之事，
The sage’s entire life is free from calamity and hardship—
由避害深也。
for he avoids harm with profound insight.

守微第六十四

Govern it before disorder arises—

A nine-tiered platform rises from a pile of earth—
从卑至高。
from low to high.

千里之行，始於足下。
A journey of a thousand *li* begins beneath one’s feet—
从近至远。
from near to far.

为者败之，
Those who act will fail—
有为於事，
when they act upon affairs,
废於自然；
they go against the *Dao* of nature;
有为於义，
when they act upon *virtue*,
废於仁，
they lose *ren* (benevolence);
有为於色，
when they act upon appearances,
废於精神也。
they lose *shen* (spirit).

执者失之。
Those who grasp will lose—
执利遇患，
when they cling to gain, they meet misfortune;
执道全身，
when they cling to the *Dao*, they preserve themselves—
坚持不得，
yet if they hold fast without yielding,
推让还及。
they may still fall back into harm.

圣人无为，
The sage acts without action—
故无败；
thus, he faces no failure;
圣人不为文华，
the sage does not indulge in superficial adornments,
不为己利，
nor does he seek personal gain,
不为残贼，
nor does he act for violence or plunder—

he loses nothing.

圣人有德以教愚，
The sage has *virtue* to teach the ignorant,
有财以与贫，
and wealth to give to the poor—

yet he does not cling to anything,
故无所失於人。
thus, he loses nothing to others.

民之从事，
The people’s undertakings—
常於几成而败之，
often fail when nearly complete—
从，为也。
*From* means *to act*.
民之为事，
When the people act upon affairs,
常於功德几成而贪位好名，
they often, when *virtue* and merit are nearly achieved,
covet rank and favor,
而奢泰盈满，
indulge in extravagance and excess,

To be cautious at the end as at the beginning—
则无败事。
then there will be no failed undertakings.

终当如始，
The end must be as the beginning—

是以圣人欲不欲#4，
Thus, the sage desires what others do not—
圣人欲人所不欲也。
the sage desires what people do not desire.

人欲彰显，
People desire prominence and display—

the sage desires to conceal his brilliance;

is to make them return to the true essence.

Yet he does not dare to act—

the sage follows the natural course of things,
不敢有所造为，
not daring to fabricate or impose,
恐离本也。
for fear of straying from the true *Dao*.

淳德第六十五
**Chapter 65: Pure *Virtue***

古之善为道者，
The ancients who excelled in practicing the *Dao*—
说古之善以道治身及治国者。
speak of those who used the *Dao* to govern themselves and the state.

非以明民，
Not to enlighten the people—
不以道教民明智巧诈也。
for he does not teach the people the *Dao* of cleverness and deceit.

将以愚之。
But to make them simple—
将以道德教民，
he uses *Dao* and *virtue* to teach the people,
使质朴不诈伪。
so they remain plain and unadulterated.

民之难治，
The people are difficult to govern—
以其智多。
because their cleverness is excessive.

民之不可治理者，
The people who cannot be governed—
以其智太多，
because their cleverness is too great,
必为巧伪。
they will inevitably resort to artifice and deceit.

以智治国，国之贼；
To govern the state with cleverness is to be its thief—
使智惠之人理国之政事，
when clever and cunning individuals manage state affairs,
必远道德，
they will inevitably drift from *Dao* and *virtue*,
妄作祸福，
recklessly creating both blessings and misfortunes,
而为国之贼也。
and thus become thieves to the state.

不以智治国，国之福。
To not govern the state with cleverness is its blessing—
不使智惠之人治国之政事，
when one does not allow clever and cunning individuals to manage state affairs,
则民守正直，
the people uphold sincerity,
不为邪饰，
they do not engage in deceitful adornment,
上下相亲，
superior and inferior are harmonious,
君臣同力，
ruler and subjects work in concert—
故为国之福也。
thus, it is a blessing for the state.

知此两者，亦楷式。
To know these two principles is to grasp the model—
两者谓智不智也。
these two refer to the use and non-use of cleverness.

常能知智者贼，不智者福，
To always recognize that cleverness is a thief and simplicity a blessing—
是治身治国之法式也。
this is the method for governing oneself and the state.

常知楷式，
To always know the model—
是谓玄德。
is called *xuan* (mysterious) *virtue*.

玄，天也。
*Xuan* is the *Dao* of heaven.

能知治身治国之法式，
To know the methods of governing oneself and the state—
是谓与天同德也。
is to be in accord with the *virtue* of heaven.

玄德深矣远矣，
This *xuan* *virtue* is profound and distant—
玄德之人深不可测，
those with *xuan* *virtue* are deep beyond measure,
远不可极也。
and far beyond reach.

与物反矣，
They go against the nature of things—
玄德之人与万物反异，
those with *xuan* *virtue* are contrary to all things,
万物欲益己，
for all things seek to benefit themselves,
玄德欲施与人也。
while *xuan* *virtue* seeks to give to others.

然后乃至大顺。
Only then do they attain great harmony—
玄德与万物反异，
for *xuan* *virtue* is contrary to all things,
故能至大顺。
thus, they reach great harmony.

大顺者，天理也。
Great harmony is the *Dao* of heaven.

**Chapter 66: The Sage Comes After Others**

江海所以能为百谷王者，
The rivers and seas are able to be the sovereigns of all the valleys—
以其善下之，
because they are good at being lowly—
江海以卑下，
the rivers and seas are humble and lowly,
故众流归之，
thus, all streams flow to them,
若民归就於王也。
as people naturally gather to their ruler.

故能为百谷王。
Thus, they are sovereigns of all the valleys.

直以就下，
Straightforwardly, they are lowly—
故能为百谷王。」
thus, they are able to be sovereigns of all the valleys.

**Chapter 67: The Three Treasures**

Thus, the Sage desires to be above the people—
to be above them in position—
yet must speak humbly to them;
following the rivers and seas,
dwelling in modesty and humility.
To lead the people—
to be before them in action—
he must place himself behind them in deed.
He serves others before himself.

Therefore, the Sage, though above the people,
does not weigh them down;
though he is their sovereign,
he does not oppress them with his exalted status,
so the people revere him without feeling burdened.
He stands before them without harming them;
though he leads, he does not blind them with his brilliance,
so the people love him as they would their parents,
with no thought of harm.
Thus, all under heaven joyfully promote him without tiring.
The Sage’s kindness is profound, his love vast—
he views the people as his own children—
so all under heaven willingly advance him as their leader,
never weary of it.
Because he does not contend,
all under heaven never tire of the Sage’s rule,
for he does not compete with others for precedence.
Thus, none can contend with him.
Men all contend in action,
but none contend in non-action.

**Chapter 68: Aligning with Heaven**

All under heaven call me great,
yet I seem unworthy.
The *Laozi* says:
*"All under heaven call me virtuous and great,
yet I feign foolishness and seem unworthy.
Only because I am truly great
do I seem unworthy.
He who boasts of his great virtue
brings harm to himself,
so I feign foolishness and seem unworthy.
I make no distinctions,
take no sides,
do not demean others while elevating myself.
If I were skilled for long,
skill would mean cleverness and cleverness is not the way of the noble.
The clever are like petty men,
not the virtuous.
I possess three treasures;
I hold and cherish them:
First, *ci*—
loving the people as my own children.
Second, *jian*—
taxing as if taking from oneself.
Third, not daring to lead all under heaven.
I practice humility and retreat,
never initiating action.
Because of *ci*, I am courageous;
first with benevolence, then with loyalty and filial piety.
Because of *jian*, I am expansive;
the Son of Heaven’s own frugality
makes the people’s daily lives abundant.
Because I do not dare lead all under heaven,
I am able to become the leader of those who follow the *Dao*.
To be the leader of those who follow the *Dao*—
this is to be the Sage.
Now, they abandon *ci* and courage,
abandon *jian* and abundance,
abandon humility and seek precedence—
this is the path of death.
He who acts thus
moves ever closer to ruin.
*Ci* in war brings victory,
in defense brings security.
The benevolent and kind
win the people’s devotion,
their hearts and minds united,
so in war they conquer the enemy,
in defense they stand firm.
Heaven aids them,
shielding them with goodness and kindness.
Heaven aids the virtuous,
endowing them with benevolence and kindness
to help themselves."

**Chapter 69: Mysterious Application**

**Chapter 70: Knowing**

The *Laozi*’s words are easy to know,
easy to practice.

「The *Laozi* says: My words are few yet easy to know,
simple yet easy to practice.
Yet none under heaven can truly know them,
none can truly practice them.
People do not love softness and weakness,
but love strength and vigor.
Words have their source,
affairs have their rulers.
What I say has its root and origin,
affairs have their lords and subjects.
Those who do not understand this
are not without my virtue—
their hearts oppose mine.

Only the unknowing
are thus unable to know me.
For it is the unknowing of the world
that renders my *Dao* and virtue obscure,
that they do not see them outwardly.
I penetrate the subtle and reach the profound mysteries,
so the unknowing remain unknowing.
Few know me,
so I am honored by those who follow me.
Few, indeed, are those who know me,
so I am cherished by those who understand the *Dao*.
Thus, the Sage wears coarse robes while harboring precious *qi*.
Wearing coarse robes means he is slighted outwardly,
harboring precious *qi* means he is rich inwardly.
He conceals his treasure and virtue,
not displaying them to the world.

**Chapter 71: Knowing Illness**

To know the unknown is supreme;
to know that one knows and yet speak of the unknown—
this is the supreme *virtue*.
To not know yet claim to know—
this is an illness.
To know that one knows and yet speak of the unknown—
this is the illness of *virtue*.

Only the sickly are thus unable to be sick.
The Sage does not suffer from this arrogance of knowledge,
for he grieves that others do.
The Sage is not sick,
for he knows sickness—
thus he is not sick.
He pities others because of this,
so he does not fall ill himself.

It is said that the Sage harbors comprehensive knowledge,
yet presents it as unknown,
so that all under heaven may remain simple and upright,
each guarding their pure nature.

The petty do not understand this intent,
yet presumptuously act with the arrogance of knowledge
to make themselves known.
They harm their *spirit* inwardly,
shorten their lifespan and waste their years.

**Chapter 72: Loving Oneself**

If the people do not fear *threat*,
then great *threat* will come.
*Threat* is harm.
If people do not fear small harm,
then great harm will come—
even fearing death itself.

Those who fear should nurture their *spirit*,
align with Heaven and follow Earth.
They should not narrow their dwelling place—
meaning the heart houses the *spirit*,
and it must always be calm and gentle,
never tight or constricted.
They should not weary of their source of life—
for people live because they possess *spirit*,
leaning on the void, delighting in stillness and purity.
If their diet is unregulated,
if they indulge in desires and lusts,
if their minds are filled with depravity,
these actions will cut short their lives and scatter their *spirit*.

Only those who do not weary
are thus not wearied.
Only those who truly do not weary of their *spirit*
can wash away the filth of their hearts,
remain tranquil and content without desire,
so that their *spirit* resides within them
and is never exhausted.

Thus, the Sage knows himself—
knows his own gains and losses.
He does not display himself—
does not flaunt his virtue and beauty outwardly,
but keeps them hidden within.
He loves himself—
loves his body to preserve his *spirit* and *qi*.
He does not prize himself—
does not seek high rank or fame in the world.
So he abandons that and takes this.
He abandons self-display and self-prize,
takes self-knowledge and self-love.

**Chapter 73: Acting with Restraint**

To dare with boldness means death;
to dare with boldness yet act means death to one’s body.
To dare without boldness means life;
to dare without boldness yet act means life for one’s body.
To know these two things—
that is, to know boldness and restraint—
is to know what may profit or harm.
To preserve life is profit,
to destroy life is harm.
What Heaven abhors
is the act of forcefulness.
Who knows its reason?
Who can understand Heaven’s intent
and avoid transgressing it?
Thus, even the Sage finds it difficult.

The Sage’s *Dao* is difficult to practice,
let alone those without the Sage’s virtue
who attempt to act thus.
The *Dao* of Heaven
does not contend yet achieves victory,
does not speak yet responds well,
does not summon yet comes naturally.
It is vast yet good at planning.
Vast, indeed, is Heaven’s *Dao*,
yet it carefully considers human affairs,
rewarding good and punishing evil,
each receiving their due.

Heaven’s net is vast and wide,
though loose, it does not miss a thing.
Heaven’s web is vast and far-reaching,
though seemingly distant,
if it examines and judges the good and evil of people,
it will not fail to see them.

**Chapter 74: Restraining Punishment**

If the people do not fear death,
then the ruler’s punishments are too severe,
and the people have no hope of survival,
so they do not fear death.
If one harms their body through indulgence,
if they squander their wealth and lose their life,
then the people do not know what to fear.
Why impose death as a threat?

The ruler should ease punishments,
teach the people to abandon desires and profits.
Yet if they act with cunning,
I can seize and execute them—
who would dare resist?

The *Laozi* laments the times
when rulers do not first cultivate the people with *Dao* and virtue,
but instead first impose punishments.

There are always those who execute punishment—
those who execute punishment are Heaven,
standing high above, observing people’s transgressions.
Heaven’s net is vast and wide,
though loose, it does not miss a thing.
If one acts as Heaven’s substitute in punishment,
this is called substituting the great carpenter to hew.
Heaven’s *Dao* is most clear,
its judgment has fixed rules,
like the seasons—
spring generates, summer grows,
autumn harvests, winter stores,
the stars and constellations move in their courses—
to govern all with its fixed order.
If a ruler attempts to substitute for Heaven’s punishment,
it is like a clumsy artisan
substituting for the great carpenter to cut wood—
laboring yet achieving no purpose.

If one substitutes for the great carpenter to hew,
there will rarely be one who does not harm their hands.
If a ruler acts with punishments,
it is like a clumsy artisan
substituting for the great carpenter to cut wood—
they cannot achieve the proper square or round,
and only harm their own hands.
Those who substitute for Heaven’s punishment
do not understand its principles,
and instead suffer its retribution.

**Chapter 75: Harm from Greed**

「The people’s hunger arises
from the excessive taxes imposed by their rulers.
The reason the people suffer hunger and cold
is that their lords take too many taxes from below.
Thus, they hunger.

The people all emulate their rulers’ greed,
abandoning the Dao and defying virtue—
hence, the hunger.

The people’s difficulty in being governed
comes from their rulers’ meddling.
The people cannot be governed
because their lords have many desires
and delight in intervention.
Thus, they are hard to govern.

Because their lords meddle,
the people’s emotions and falsehoods
become difficult to govern.

The people’s recklessness with death
stems from their excessive pursuit of life.
Those who lightly risk death
do so because their obsession with life’s affairs
and greed for gain endangers themselves.
Thus, they treat death lightly.

By pursuing life too fervently,
they court their own demise.

Only those who do not fixate on life
are wiser than those who revere it.
Only those who solely do not fixate on life’s concerns—
who neither covet rank and honor
nor amass wealth and profit—
who neither the Son of Heaven can claim as subjects
nor lords can command as servants,
are wiser than those who revere life.

**Chapter 76: Admonish the Overbearing**
Human life is soft and frail,
for living beings are born with harmonious *qi*,
embracing vital spirit—
thus, they are soft and frail.

But in death, they become hard and strong.
When one dies, harmonious *qi* is exhausted,
vital spirit departs—
thus, they become hard and strong.

All things, grasses and trees,
are soft and pliable when alive,
for harmonious *qi* remains.
But when they die, they wither and decay,
for harmonious *qi* disperses.
Thus, the hard and strong are the remnants of death,
while the soft and frail are the essence of life.

From these two observations,
one knows that the hard and strong perish,
while the soft and frail endure.
Thus, a strong army cannot conquer,
for its might invites reckless slaughter,
spreading poison and resentment.
The weak overcome the strong—
thus, it cannot conquer.

A strong tree decays,
for its rigid branches and leaves
suffer from its own strength.
The strong lie below,
the weak rise above.
In cultivating things and achieving works,
great trees must be placed below,
small things above.
This is the natural effect of Heaven’s Dao—
suppressing the strong and upholding the weak.

**Chapter 77: The Dao of Heaven**
The Dao of Heaven is like drawing a bow.
Heaven’s Dao is subtle and profound,
and all things are likened to it.
The high are brought low,
the low are raised up,
the overabundant are diminished,
the deficient are supplied.
Speaking of a bow’s balance and adjustment as such,
it can then be used.

To bring the high low and the low high,
to diminish the strong and benefit the weak—
this is Heaven’s Dao.
Heaven’s Dao diminishes excess and supplements deficiency,
prioritizing moderation and harmony.
Human affairs are otherwise,
for human affairs oppose Heaven’s Dao,
diminishing the deficient to serve the excess.
Common folk diminish the poor to enrich the rich,
plunder the weak to empower the strong.
Who can truly use their excess to benefit all under Heaven?
Only those with the Dao.

The Sage acts yet does not claim,
bestowing virtue and blessings without expectation of return.
They achieve their purpose yet do not dwell in it,
for when their work is done,
they do not remain in their position.
They do not desire to be seen as virtuous,
for they do not wish others to know of their own virtue.
They conceal their deeds and do not dwell on honor,
fearing Heaven’s punishment for excess.
They trust in sincerity.

**Chapter 78: Trust in Integrity**
Water is the softest and weakest under Heaven,
for it adapts—
round when round, square when square—
contained, it stops;
unleashed, it flows.
Yet nothing can overcome it in attacking the hard and strong,
for water can embrace mountains and enclose hills,
erode iron and melt copper.
No force can conquer water yet achieve its purpose.
For nothing is as effortlessly powerful as water.

Thus, the soft overcomes the hard,
for the tongue is soft while the teeth are hard,
yet the teeth perish before the tongue.
The weak overcome the strong,
for water extinguishes fire,
and *yin* consumes *yang*.
All under Heaven know this,
yet few can act accordingly.
They shame humility and prefer strength,
thus the Sage says:
*"To bear the filth of a state*
*is to be called its sovereign."*
A ruler who endures their state’s impurities,
like the great rivers and seas that do not resist small streams,
can long preserve the altars of soil and grain,
and be the sovereign of a single state.

*"To bear the ill-fortune of a state*
*is to be called the King of all under Heaven."*
A ruler who takes blame upon themselves,
and bears the misfortunes of the people,
can then rule all under Heaven.

This is straight speech taken as reverse.」

The Sage, though governing a great state,
still treats it as a small one,
demonstrating frugality,
not indulging in extravagance.
The people, though many,
are as if few and scarce,
daring not to labor them.
Let there be the *shí-bǎi* (units of ten and hundred),
so that each citizen has their *bùqū* (military divisions and civilian groups),
and the noble and humble do not encroach upon one another.
The farmer’s tools are kept,
yet not used to seize their time.

A ruler makes death precious to the people,
for when they bring benefit and remove harm,
each attains their due,
and the people value death over life.
Yet they do not move far away.
When governance is simple and orders few,
the people settle into their occupations,
thus they do not migrate far,
and remain in their steadfast homes.
Though there are boats and carriages,
they find no use for them;
in tranquility and non-action,
they shun frivolous adornments,
and do not delight in travel or amusement.
Though there are arms and armor,
they display them not,
and harbor no resentment toward all under Heaven.
The people return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.
Discarding artifice and reverting to simplicity,
they trust without deceit.

They find contentment in their food,
in the simple grains and vegetables,
not plundering the people for fish and luxuries.
They adorn their clothing,
in the plain and coarse garments,
not favoring the five bright hues.
They make their dwellings secure,
in humble thatched huts,
not indulging in ornate architecture.
They take joy in their customs,
in the plain and honest ways,
not altering them with foreign fashions.
Neighboring states are visible,
where the sounds of roosters and dogs intermingle,
for they are close at hand.
Yet the people, until old age and death,
do not visit one another.
This is their lack of desire for external things.

**Chapter Eighty: Plain Speech**
Plain speech is not adorned,
for plain speech is as it truly is.
Not adorned means it is unembellished and genuine.
Adorned speech is not plain,
for excessive ornamentation leads to hollow and deceitful words.
The virtuous do not argue,
for the virtuous cultivate the Dao in their conduct.
Not to argue means they do not indulge in rhetorical flourishes.
Those who argue are not virtuous,
for argumentative speech brings calamity.
The Sage does not hoard,
for the Sage accumulates virtue, not wealth,
teaching the ignorant with their virtue,
and aiding the poor with their riches.
When they give to others,
they themselves grow ever more abundant.
When they share with others,
they themselves grow ever more plentiful.
The Way of Heaven
is to benefit and not harm;
Heaven nurtures all things,
loving them to growth and maturity,
without injury.
The Sage’s Way
is to act without striving.
The Sage follows Heaven’s Way in their governance,
achieving their aims without contention,
and thus preserves their sacred virtue.

**End of the Fourth Scroll of the *Zhenjing* of Dao and Virtue.**

*(The following lines are present in the Song shadow copy but omitted here:)*
*"Not their spirits, but their ghosts do not harm,
for their ghosts are not without vitality;
evil cannot enter the virtuous,
and thus cannot harm those of natural disposition."*
