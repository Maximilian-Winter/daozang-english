**Preface to *The Threefold Exegesis of the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue***
By Deng Qi, the Jade Guest

The Most High Lord Lao is the Perfected One of the Four Extremities.
*Tai* (Most) is the extremity of greatness.
*Shang* (High) is the extremity of loftiness.
*Lao* (Old) is the extremity of longevity.
*Jun* (Lord) is the extremity of humanity.
Thus, he is called the Four Extremities.

The *Zhouyi*’s Upper Canon begins with the number three, and its Lower Canon concludes with four, comprising sixty-four hexagrams.
The *Daode*’s Upper Canon begins with three, and its Lower Canon concludes with four, comprising eighty-one chapters.
The *Tai Xuan*’s directions commence with three, and its domains culminate in nine, aligning with the *Yi*’s eighty-one heads—Dao and virtue converge as one.

Was Master Heshang not extraordinary?
Laozi cultivated the Dao and its virtue, concealing himself in namelessness. Dwelling in Zhou for a long time, he eventually departed to wander westward. Guanling Yin Xi, a man of great capacity, perceived his qi in advance and knew a perfected one was approaching. He sought him out and awaited his arrival. Thus, he recognized Laozi amid the dust of the world, and believing the great Dao was about to withdraw, urgently entreated him to compose a text—an act akin to that of a sage. Laozi, recognizing his uniqueness, expounded the two canons, Upper and Lower. Vast yet without exterior, minute yet without interior, spherical yet without circumference, square yet without corners—this is called the Beginningless. Since the kalpas began, heaven and earth have seen the great Dao emerge and enter through the midst of sages, embracing the Three Powers and doubling them.

Thus, the five thousand words gallop across the primordial mind-ground of Fuxi, leaving no tracks. If one clings to chapter and verse, it becomes but a circling within the footprints of the Zhou and Confucius, grasping at images and things—how then can one perceive the Dao and its virtue? Hence, the learning of Zhuangzi and Liezi indulges in grandiloquence and eloquence, while the learning of Shen Buhai and Han Fei specializes in penal codes and names.

The learning of Wang and Xie borrows the guise of abstruse discourse. Yet this is not the case where "the benevolent see it as benevolence, the wise see it as wisdom"—it is precisely what the Five Hegemons did, using empty names to seize real profit. How then can one perceive the heart of Laozi? Now, in the leisure between studying the *Zhouyi* and the *Analects*, with remaining strength, I have reverently followed the chapter and verse of the *Daode*, dividing it into three interpretations. Thus, one knows that heaven and earth are vast, yet creation is one, emerging from the sage—acting without action. Is its purport not profound?

The first interpretation, "Scripture," merely adjusts the punctuation of the original text, adding or removing one or two function words, so that the reader first grasps the righteousness of each chapter, naturally complete and without flaw.

The second interpretation, "Dao," directly expounds the great Dao of heaven and earth, its beginning and end, origin and return, its numbers and principles fitting like tallying tokens.

The third interpretation, "Virtue," interweaves qian and kun, inverts water and fire, aligns east-metal with west-wood, coagulates mercury and congeals lead—every movement and stillness harmonizing with the great Dao.

In total, over fifty thousand words, titled *Three Interpretations*. The *Daodejing* aligns with the *Great Change*; where it cannot accommodate the heart-mind, the sages before and after remain of one measure. Laozi’s single work takes true constancy as its essence. Yet commentators have blended it entirely with Dao and virtue, unaware of guest and host, superior and inferior, leading Confucians to recklessly generate divergent views, with no distinction to separate them.

Here, I first set forth the *Three Hundred Characters on True Constancy*, matching the number of the *Yinfu*, arranging them in the preface, so that later scholars of Dao and virtue may not stray far from their return.

Scholars of the four directions who verify the Dao, peruse and examine this work—if there is anything worthy of adoption, it would suffice for this humble woodcutter to hear his name.

Preface by Deng Qi, the Jade Guest, in the autumn of the *wuxu* year of the Dade reign (1308).

**Three Hundred Characters on True Constancy**

The constancy of true constancy is called constancy;
The truth of true truth is called truth.
True constancy in the Dao embraces all;
True constancy in virtue regulates all;
True constancy in life determines all;
True constancy in nature responds to all;
True constancy in principle governs all.

Before heaven and earth began, true constancy truly abides;
After heaven and earth end, true constancy truly empties.
All things bear yin and embrace yang;
The sage thereby possesses constancy.
The great Dao can decay yet not renew;
The sage thereby possesses truth.
If truth had form, it would be boundless and void;
If constancy had a name, it would be bodiless yet present.

The Dao is constantly without action yet nothing is left undone;
The true Dao is empty and follows, yet nothing follows it.
When the sage ascends to the utmost, he is true, merging with the Dao in truth.
Above and below have no constancy; movement and stillness have constancy.
Qian begins by benefiting all under heaven with beauty and profit, yet does not speak of what it profits;
Water benefits all things with beauty and profit, yet does not speak of its virtue.

Acting for the sake of action loses truth;
Not employing it returns to constancy.
The sun and moon alternate to generate light;
Cold and heat alternate to complete the year—
Thus true constancy has no form or name.
The Dao of heaven speaks not yet reveals its merit;
The Dao of earth achieves not yet succeeds in its end—
Thus true constancy is not empty nothingness.

Emptiness and nothingness succeed one another;
Heaven and earth have no substance.
Without emptiness, without substance,
One returns to the limitless.
Without limit, without boundary,
True constancy then rests.
The rest of true constancy is profoundly without rest;
The rest without rest—
True constancy then ceases.
The cessation of true constancy is profoundly without cessation;
The cessation without cessation—
Utterly unattainable, utterly unlosable.
Thus true constancy does not vainly cease.

**The Great Transmission of Laozi**

Laozi was a native of Quren Village, Lixiang, Ku County in Chu. His surname was Li, given name Er, courtesy name Boyang, posthumous name Dan. He was the keeper of archives in Zhou. When Confucius visited Zhou, he was about to inquire about ritual from Laozi.

Laozi said: "What you speak of—the man and his bones have already decayed; only his words remain. Moreover, when the noble person meets his time, he mounts his carriage; when he does not meet his time, he drifts like tumbleweed. I have heard that a good merchant hides his wealth as if empty, and a noble person of great virtue appears foolish. Rid yourself of your arrogance, excessive desires, affected demeanor, and extravagant ambitions—these are all of no benefit to your person. What I have to tell you is only this."

The *Family Sayings* and *Observing Zhou* record this in detail.

Confucius departed and said to his disciples: "Birds—I know they can fly; fish—I know they can swim; beasts—I know they can run. Those that run may be caught in nets, those that swim may be caught with lines, those that fly may be struck down with arrows. But as for the dragon, I cannot know it—how it rides the wind and clouds to ascend the heavens. Today I have seen Laozi—is he not like the dragon?

Laozi cultivated the Dao and its virtue, taking concealment and namelessness as his practice. He dwelled long in Zhou, but seeing its decline, he departed. When he reached the pass, the Keeper of the Pass, Yin Xi, said: 'You are about to withdraw from the world—compel yourself to write a book for me.' Thereupon Laozi composed a work in two scrolls, expounding the meaning of the Dao and its virtue in over five thousand words, then left. None knew where he ended.

Some say Lao Laizi was also a man of Chu, who wrote fifteen scrolls on the application of the Daoist teachings, and was a contemporary of Confucius. Laozi was said to have lived over one hundred and sixty years, or even over two hundred, due to his cultivation of the Dao and nurturing of longevity.

One hundred and twenty-nine years after Confucius’ death, the Grand Historian Tan of Zhou met Duke Xian of Qin and said: 'At first, Qin and Zhou were united, then parted; after five hundred years they will unite again, and after seventy years a hegemon-king will arise.' Some say Dan was Laozi himself; others say he was not. The world knows not whether this is so or not.

Laozi was a reclusive gentleman. Laozi’s son was named Zong, who became a general of Wei and was enfeoffed at Duan’gan. Zong’s son was Zhu; Zhu’s son was Gong; Gong’s great-great-grandson was Jia, who served under Emperor Wen of Han. At that time, Jia’s son Jie was Grand Tutor to King Gong of Jiaoxi and thus settled his family in Qi.

Those who study Laozi disparage the Confucians, and the Confucians likewise disparage Laozi. 'The Dao differs—there is no shared counsel between them.' Could this be what is meant?

Li Er embodied non-action and self-transformation, purity and self-rectification.

The Left Immortal Duke Ge Xuan said: In the Zhou era, Laozi once manifested as a divine being. His mother gave birth to him by splitting open her left armpit, and at birth he was radiant, thus named 'Supreme.' Emerging through the Mystery, he existed before heaven and earth, without age or decline, hence called 'Supreme'—the incarnate form of the Three Pure Ones.

**The Orthodox Lineage of the Great Dao**

The teaching of the Mysterious School takes purity, emptiness, and the Correct Unity as its essence, and immortality as its joy. Thus, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Floating Radiance, after countless kalpas, attained the Three Pure Ones. And from the Three Pure Ones, after countless millennia, he descended as Laozi to deliver the Perfected One Yin Xi. Through Immortal Minister Li Yi, spanning ten generations from Zhou to Han, the transmission continued.

Thereafter, the Venerable Man of the River emerged. From Anqisheng, through nine transmissions, it reached the Three Yangs, extending into the Five Dynasties. From the time the Three Yangs first proclaimed the Dao, through the lineage of the True Man Hai Chan, it passed to Zhang Ziyang, then to Wang Chongyang. Ziyang transmitted it to Cui Xuan; Cui Xuan to Zi Xian; Zi Xian to Cui Xu; Cui Xu to Hai Qiong—nine transmissions in all for the Master. Wang Chongyang’s transmission branched into the Seven Perfected, with countless hidden connections, collateral teachings, and universal deliverance—numbering in the millions. As for the orthodox transmission of the Great Dao, it has now reached the thirty-fifth generation in Master Hai Qiong.

Only the sages of antiquity enjoyed extended lifespans, their years and kalpas immeasurably long. From the middle ancient era, Heaven did not withhold the Dao, spreading it among humanity to deliver countless beings. The span of its transmission to the present is likewise incalculable.

After Hai Qiong, the singular thread of the Great Dao passed to the Master of Crane Forest, who revived the lost learning of the former sages and established the Dharma-gate for later generations. In leisure, reflecting on the difficulty of transmission and tracing its origins, I have set forth its lineage and committed it to print.

Tingzhi, humbly numbered among the disciples of the Master of Crane Forest, now burns incense, bows deeply, and records this. Written on the winter solstice of the *gengshen* year by disciple Xiao Tingzhi.

**The Chronology of the Great Dao**

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Floating Radiance is the Dao that generates the Supreme Ultimate. After thirty-two thousand four hundred years, it reached the Jade Pure Primordial Heavenly Worthy—'the Dao generates the One,' hence matched with Fuxi, the Heavenly Sovereign. After another ten thousand eight hundred years, it reached the Supreme Pure Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy—'the One generates the Two,' hence matched with Shennong, the Earthly Sovereign. After another ten thousand eight hundred years, it reached the Grand Pure Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and its Virtue—'the Two generates the Three,' hence matched with Xuanyuan, the Human Sovereign.

The Grand Pure Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and its Virtue, together with the Supreme Primordial Lady, transmitted the precelestial Great Dao—'the Three generates the myriad things,' hence matched with the seventy-two masters led by Master Guangcheng. After another one thousand nine hundred years, it reached the Highest Laozi, at which time the Compassionate Sage was also born into the world. 'The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,' and the division of yin and yang established the Two Modes. Thus, the seventy-two worthies led by the Great Sage Confucius were matched with them. 'The qi of harmony is the mean'—encompassing the Three Powers and doubling them.

The Three Teachings stood like the legs of a tripod in the world, and the Dao of kings and lords was complete. Thus it is said: 'Things may be diminished yet benefit, or increased yet suffer harm.' 'What others teach, I also teach.' 'The strong and overbearing do not meet a natural death—I shall take this as the father of my teaching.' The chronology of the Great Dao fits like tallying tokens. The orthodoxy and its lineage are known to those who understand.

**The Three Explanations of the *Dao and Its Virtue*: Scroll One**
**Jade Guest Deng Qi’s Explanation**

**Chapter One: "The Dao That Can Be Spoken"**

The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao;
The name that can be named is not the constant name.
Nameless—it is the beginning of heaven and earth;
Named—it is the mother of the myriad things.
Always desireless, one observes its mystery;
Always desiring, one observes its manifestations.

Always desiring, one observes its manifestations.
These two emerge together yet bear different names—
both are called the profound.
Profound and yet more profound:
the gateway to all mysteries.

The *Scripture* states: "The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao. The name that can be named is not the constant name. Nameless—it is the beginning of heaven and earth; named—it is the mother of the myriad things. Always desireless, one thereby observes its mystery; always desiring, one thereby observes its manifestations." Mystery is the constancy of the nameless; manifestation is the Dao of the named. These two emerge from the same source yet serve as different guests—hence they are called distinct. Both are termed the profound. Profound and yet more profound: the gateway to all mysteries.

The Dao declares: "Without thought, without action—this is called the constant Dao. Spiritually wondrous and unified in governance—this is called the constant name." The Dao is the central emptiness of the Great Ultimate. The name is the great image of heaven and earth. Within the central emptiness of the Great Ultimate, what Dao is absent? Yet when divided among the myriad things, each possesses its own Dao. How can the Dao of a single thing encompass the whole? Unable to encompass the whole, one imposes names by force—such forced naming is not the constant Dao. Within the great image of heaven and earth, what name is absent? Yet when manifested in the myriad things, each bears its own name. How can the name of a single thing encompass all? Unable to encompass all, one imposes names by force—such forced naming is not the constant name.

Before heaven and earth were born, what name could there be at the beginningless beginning? Once the myriad things are formed, without the mother, what shape could there be? To observe its mystery, there is the Dao of constant non-being. To observe its manifestations, there is the Dao of constant being. These two emerge together from non-thought and non-action, bearing different names in the spiritually wondrous and unified—thus they are called the profound. Profound and yet more profound: the gateway to all mysteries. Those who ascend the hall, enter the chamber, and preside over the innermost—are they not the sages?

The *Virtue* states: "When male and female are yet to unite, only essence and oneness hold fast to the center." The Dao that cannot be spoken abides in the constant Dao; the name that cannot be named abides in the constant name. Nameless—it is the beginning of heaven and earth. Everlasting are husband and wife, male and female dwelling together, the great human bond, embracing the infant. The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. Named—it is the mother of the myriad things. Ceasing to speak of male above and female below, all things transform from negation. Always desireless, one thereby observes its mystery. Yielding and moving, hardness and softness respond in kind, all things transform from peace. Always desiring, one thereby observes its subtleties.

That by which heaven and earth become heaven and earth is the constant Dao. That by which male and female become heaven and earth is the constant name. These two converge yet follow different paths, emerge from the same source yet bear different names; governed by one principle yet with a hundred considerations, they diverge yet share the same name. Thus it is said: both are termed the profound. Profound and yet more profound: the gateway to all mysteries. To enter the gateway of all mysteries, one must encounter the perfected. **Chapter Two: "When All Under Heaven Know"**

When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises;
When all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises.
Thus being and non-being give rise to each other,
Difficulty and ease complete each other,
Long and short shape each other,
High and low incline toward each other,
Tones and voices harmonize with each other,
Front and back follow each other.

Therefore the sage abides in non-action,
Practices the teaching without words,
Allows the myriad things to arise without initiating,
Gives life without possessing,
Acts without relying,
Completes without dwelling.
Only by not dwelling does one not depart.

The *Scripture* states: "When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, this is ugliness. When all know goodness as goodness, this is not-goodness. Thus beauty and ugliness oppose each other, being and non-being give rise to each other, difficulty and ease complete each other, long and short shape each other, high and low incline toward each other, tone and voice harmonize with each other, front and back follow each other. Therefore the sage abides in non-action, practices the teaching without words, allows the myriad things to arise without claiming, for they give life without possessing, act without relying, complete without dwelling. By not dwelling, all under heaven cannot remove their beauty."

The Dao declares: "Without the myriad things, one does not know there are humans; without humans, one does not know there are heaven and earth; without heaven and earth, one does not know there is the Dao—how could one know the constant? As the constant Dao, who could deem it ugly? Yet when the myriad things arise together, beauty and ugliness take shape within them. Thus in the affairs of all under heaven, without ugliness one does not know beauty; without not-goodness one does not know goodness. Once beauty is known as beauty and goodness as goodness, then ugliness and not-goodness are distinguished within them—hence the Dao of mutual arising, mutual completing, mutual shaping, and mutual inclining abides therein. Therefore the sage abides in non-action and the people transform themselves, practices the teaching without words and the people trust themselves. Though the myriad things arise, they do not claim, for heaven and earth give life of themselves without possessing me, act of themselves without relying on me, complete of themselves without dwelling in me. By upholding this non-dwelling, the beauty of the sage cannot be removed."

The *Virtue* states: "Yin and yang, movement and stillness, serve as each other’s foundation; hardness and softness, substance and function, form each other—all are the supreme beauty of all under heaven. To know the Dao in beauty is constancy; to know beauty as beauty is desire. To take desire as the Dao—this is ugliness. When Qian and Kun intermingle, Kan and Li are born; when Kan and Li intermingle, heaven and earth are restored. When all under heaven know intermingling as the Dao, is this not perfect goodness and perfect beauty? When all take intermingling as desire, how can this not be called ugliness? Thus being and non-being give rise to each other, as the sun and moon shine together; difficulty and ease complete each other, as water and fire restrain each other; long and short shape each other, as the crescent and full moon differ; high and low incline toward each other, as yin and yang press upon each other."

Sounds harmonize with each other, as yang leads and yin responds; front and rear follow one another, as the two, three, six, and nine. Thus though the sage may wish to act, what is there to act upon? Though he may wish to teach, what is there to say? The myriad things arise together—what is there to reject? Therefore he gives life yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely, accomplishes yet does not dwell. Thus the sage can perfect the beauty of all under heaven, and so his days do not pass away.

If there is an "I," he inevitably loses the Dao of spontaneity and falls into excess—how can this not be called ugliness?

**Chapter Three: Not Exalting the Worthy**
Not exalting the worthy makes the people not contend; not prizing rare goods makes the people not steal; not displaying what is desirable keeps the people’s hearts from disorder. Therefore in the sage’s governance, he empties their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their ambitions, and strengthens their bones. He constantly keeps the people without knowledge and without desire, so that those with knowledge dare not act. Acting through non-action, there is nothing that is not well-ordered.

The *Classic* says: If one does not exalt the worthy, what use is contention among the people? If one does not prize rare goods, what use is theft among the people? If one does not display what is desirable, the people naturally do not fall into disorder. Thus in the sage’s governance, he constantly empties the mind through the Dao, fills the belly with the myriad things, weakens ambition through non-action, and strengthens the bones through non-doing. Naturally, the people are without knowledge and without desire, and even if there are those with knowledge, they dare not act. Acting through non-action, all under heaven is without disorder.

The *Dao* says: The ease of what precedes design—governing through non-action—rising, they breathe gently; resting, they sigh softly. Eating raw flesh and drinking blood, the people and things transform themselves. Ever since *Daxu* exalted the worthy, there has been *Yi*’s self-indulgence; ever since *Shihe* amassed goods, there have been *Yu*’s violent bandits. Thus not displaying what is desirable keeps the people’s hearts from disorder.

Therefore in the sage’s governance, he takes the heart of all under heaven as his heart, ever receiving others with emptiness; he takes the belly of all under heaven as his belly, ever renewing virtue with fullness. Valuing the lowly and the noble alike, he greatly wins the people—thus he weakens their ambitions. The great person has achievements, ever strengthening himself without ceasing—thus he strengthens their bones. He constantly keeps the people without means to know, without means to desire, so that even if one or two with knowledge exist, they dare not act. For when the sage acts through non-action, all under heaven is without disorder.

The *Virtue* says: Within the body, worthy conduct is naturally not exalted—who would contend? Within the body, goods are naturally not prized—who would steal? Without contention, without theft, without displaying what is desirable, the people naturally do not fall into disorder. But if one makes them know, they contend over worthiness without exalting the worthy, steal goods without prizing them, and follow their hearts’ desires without restraint. When worthiness is destroyed and goods are exhausted, how can this last long?

Thus in the sage’s governance, he empties the mind with true constancy and utmost stillness, fills the belly with heaven and earth and sun and moon, weakens ambition with southern water and northern fire, and strengthens the bones with eastern metal and western wood. The people naturally have no knowledge, naturally have no desire, so that those with knowledge dare not act for their entire lives. For acting through action, there is nothing that is not disordered; acting through non-action, there is nothing that is not well-ordered.

**Chapter Four: The Dao’s Profundity**
The Dao is profound and used, yet it is never full. Abysmal, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things. It blunts their sharpness, unties their tangles, harmonizes their radiance, and mingles with their dust. Deep and clear, it seems to endure. I do not know whose child it is—it seems prior to the Lord of Heaven.

The *Classic* says: Using the Dao’s profundity, it is never full. Vast and abysmal, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things. It blunts the sharpness of their qi, unties the tangles of things, harmonizes their brilliance, and mingles with their dust. Clear and still, the Dao seems to endure. Those who attain this Dao—I do not know whose child they are—it seems the Lord of Heaven emerges prior to *Zhen*.

The *Dao* says: Pure qi rises to become heaven, turbid qi descends to become earth, and the harmonizing qi in the center becomes humans. Heaven and earth serve as the Dao’s function, yet they are never full; humans serve as the function of heaven and earth, yet they are never filled. When filled, they nearly come to rest.

Thus the sage, equal in sageliness and vast in depth, seems the ancestor of the myriad things. Ever with the upright qi, he blunts its sharpness, unties its tangles, harmonizes its radiance, and mingles with its dust. Clear and still, the Dao constantly seems to endure. Is he not prior to the people of the *Fuxi* era? Since *Fuxi*, the Dao has been used to its utmost. The Great Ultimate’s single circle—when has it ever been full? Void and bright, clear and penetrating, it is the ancestor of the myriad things. Using the round to cut the square blunts its sharpness; dividing yin and yang unties its tangles; alternating softness and hardness harmonizes its radiance; the six positions completing their patterns mingle with its dust. Changing and moving without abiding, flowing through the six voids, the Dao is deep and clear, enduring within them. I do not know whose child it is—it seems the image of the Lord of Heaven emerging from *Zhen*.

The *Virtue* says: Profundity is emptiness within. Using the Dao, it is never full—if full, it would exceed expectations. Deep and abysmal, it is the ancestor of the myriad things. With emptiness within, there is something—what else could it be but the ancestor? Though it blunts their sharpness, from where does it blunt them? Though it unties their tangles, from where does it untie them? Though it harmonizes their radiance, from where does it harmonize them? Though it mingles with their dust, from where does it mingle with them? Clear and still, each has the Dao enduring within—this single profound thing, I do not know whose child it will be. Those who become its child, within a single time period, seem prior to the Lord of Heaven.

**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent**
Heaven and earth are not benevolent—they regard the myriad things as straw dogs; the sage is not benevolent—he regards the hundred clans as straw dogs. Is not the space between heaven and earth like a bellows? Empty yet not collapsing, moving and ever producing. Much speech leads to exhaustion—it is better to guard the center.

The Scripture states: Heaven and earth are not seven—how then do they regard the myriad things as straw dogs? They jointly uphold the Dao. The sage is not benevolent—how then does he regard the hundred clans as straw dogs? They jointly uphold heaven and earth. Are not the myriad things and the hundred clans like straw dogs? The Dao’s emptiness, the space between heaven and earth—is it not like a bellows? The qi’s emptiness: though void, it does not collapse; the more it moves, the more it produces. Better to guard emptiness. Much speech leads to exhaustion—better to guard the center.

The Dao says: Laying out white thatch—this is the utmost caution. That straw, though slight, may bear great weight. Exercise such caution in all arts, and you shall never err. Heaven and earth bestow no grace, yet great grace arises; thunder and fierce winds stir all things without exception. Heaven and earth are not benevolent, yet they are benevolent. The sage tempers severity with lenience, lenience with severity; severity and lenience balance each other, and governance is harmonized. The sage is not benevolent. The sage’s relation to the hundred clans is as heaven and earth’s to the myriad things: if unused, they are set aside; if used, they are honored as in sacrifice—what could be weightier? Straw dogs are what heaven, earth, and the sage hold in highest regard. Though the myriad things differ, none may join heaven in serving the Dao; though the hundred clans differ, none may join the sage in serving heaven. Only the straw dog may join heaven, earth, and the sage in this service. Do heaven, earth, and the sage not show benevolence to the myriad things and the hundred clans? Yet the myriad things and the hundred clans use them daily without knowing they are heaven and earth’s, the sage’s straw dogs—is their benevolence not profound?

Between heaven and earth, Kun is the bellows-sack, Qian the pipe and key. Thus, closing the door is Kun, opening it is Qian; one closing and one opening is called change, ceaseless coming and going is called passage. Hence, “empty yet not collapsing, moving and ever producing.” Therefore, the sage guards the center; his words do not reach exhaustion. When exhaustion comes, change follows; change brings passage, passage brings endurance. This does not depart from the sage’s center—hence, “it is better to guard the center.”

Virtue says: Do heaven and earth ever fail to be benevolent? Things live by their own life, die by their own death. Does the sage ever fail to be benevolent? People live out their years or die young by their own fate. Life and death, long years and early demise—creatures and people bring these upon themselves. How could heaven, earth, and the sage be other than benevolent? To harm heaven and earth is the sage’s benevolence. If one knows that creatures and people are straw dogs, and heaven and earth are bellows, then one may forge the furnace to encircle heaven, wield hammer and tongs at the Supreme Ultimate, draw forth and replenish the sun and moon, set the stars in motion, transmute iron into gold, transcend the ordinary to enter sagehood, so that heaven cannot fulfill its numbers, the sage cannot claim his people. Though called not benevolent, where could benevolence be applied? Thus, “empty yet not collapsing, moving and ever producing.” No need for much speech—much speech leads to exhaustion. Better to guard the center, to regard heaven and self as one, past and present as one, the myriad things and self as one.

**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit Does Not Die**
The valley spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth. Subtly, it seems to endure; its use is inexhaustible.

The Scripture states: An empty valley carries sound—its spirit does not die. This spirit is called the Mysterious Female. Heaven is the Mysterious, earth is the Female; Qian and Kun are the gates of change. The gate of Qian and Kun is called the root of heaven and earth. Subtly, it forms nature; enduring, it is ever in use, not through striving. The Dao says: In *Ascending*, the nine in the third place ascends to an empty city—heaven and earth are like a valley. Above and below are empty, yet its spirit does not die. Growth, harvest, storage, and the arising of the myriad things—this is called the Mysterious Female. In the top six, darkly ascending to its proper correlate, it is beneficial to persevere in unceasing integrity—this is the gate of the Mysterious Female. Returning to the first yang in the Kan trigram, wood grows within earth—this is called the root of heaven and earth. Thus, “subtly, it seems to endure; its use is inexhaustible.” The double-yang flower, if not distant, must die.

Virtue says: The chamber of the valley spirit dwells in the Northern Sea, presiding over the watery abode. It has a name but no form, its transformations are unfathomable. Above, it joins the Mysterious of heaven; below, it unites with the Female of earth. The Mysterious and Female merge in the valley—its spirit does not die. “The valley spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female.” Thus, “the gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth.” “The hidden dragon does not act”—subtly, it seems to endure. If used, it startles for a hundred leagues—hence, “its use is inexhaustible.” Master Ziyang said: To keep the valley spirit ever undying, one must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root. When true essence returns to the golden chamber, a single bright pearl will never depart. He also said: The gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known; most mistakenly apply it to mouth and nose. Though you may practice breath control for a thousand years, how can you seize the golden crow and the jade hare? Only those who truly know the Mysterious Female understand.

**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth Endure**
Heaven and earth endure. The reason heaven and earth can be long and enduring is that they do not live for themselves—thus they can long endure. Therefore, the sage places himself last and finds himself first, sets himself outside and finds himself preserved. Is it not because he is without self-interest? Thus he can fulfill his self-interest.

The Scripture states: Heaven and earth endure—the Dao is ever without action. The reason heaven can be long and earth can endure is that they do not live for themselves—thus they can long endure. Therefore, the sage places himself last and finds himself first, sets himself outside and finds himself preserved. Lasting in being last, lasting in being outside—is it not because he is without self-interest? Finding himself first, finding himself preserved—thus he can fulfill his self-interest. The Dao says: Thus, the *Book of Changes* has the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes. The Two Modes generate the Four Images, the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams. The Eight Trigrams determine good and ill fortune; good and ill fortune give rise to great undertakings. The reason heaven can be long and enduring is that it does not live for itself—thus it can long endure. Therefore, the sage places himself last and finds himself first; his Dao thus enables him to be first.

Setting himself outside yet preserving himself—his Dao thus enables him to preserve himself. Is it not because he is without self-interest? His self is first preserved by the Dao, thus he can fulfill his self-interest.

Virtue says: Heaven and earth can be long and enduring because they do not live for themselves. The sage can be long and enduring because he does not live for himself. If heaven and earth lived for themselves, they would not endure long before perishing. If the sage lived for himself, he would not endure long before failing. Therefore, the sage first nurtures others’ selves and thus can possess his own self; he first preserves others’ selves and thus can set his own self outside. Is this not because he is without self-interest? Putting others first and himself last, he thus fulfills his self-interest.

**Chapter Eight: The Highest Virtue Resembles Water**
The highest virtue resembles water. Water benefits the myriad things without contention, dwelling in places all others shun—thus it nearly approaches the Dao.
Dwelling in good earth, the mind in profound depth,
Giving with goodwill, speaking with good faith,
Governing with good order, handling affairs with good skill,
Moving with good timing.
Only by not contending does one remain free from blame.

The Classic says: The highest virtue resembles water. Water benefits the myriad things without contention, flowing to the lowest places, dwelling where all others shun—thus it nearly approaches the Dao.
In dwelling, it is good at earth;
In the mind, it is good at depth;
In giving, it is good at humaneness;
In speech, it is good at sincerity;
In governance, it is good at order;
In affairs, it is good at skill;
In movement, it is good at timing.
Through this non-contention, it remains free from fault.

The Dao says: Heaven is one, earth is six; Qian and Kan form water. Qian knows the great beginning; Kan presides over labor and movement—thus it is called the highest virtue. Qian, as the beginning, can bestow great benefit upon all under heaven without speaking of what it bestows—how then could it contend? Kan as water is the place where the myriad things return and are stored, dwelling where all others shun—thus it nearly approaches the Dao.
Dwelling in good earth: the perilous heights of heaven cannot be scaled; the perilous earth comprises mountains, rivers, hills, and mounds.
The mind in profound depth: water flows yet does not overflow.
Giving with goodwill: conduct is esteemed, and going forth brings merit.
Speaking with good faith: traversing peril without losing trust.
Governing with good order: only with a penetrating mind can one be firm yet centered.
Handling affairs with good skill: kings and lords set perils to guard their states.
Moving with good timing: the timely use of peril—how great it is!
Only by not contending—laboring through Kan—though laboring, who can find fault with it? Thus it remains free from blame.

Virtue says: As Master Ziyang said of the *White Tiger’s First Classic* and the divine water of the Treasure Flower Pool’s true gold, one then understands that the source of the highest virtue’s benefit runs deep—unlike ordinary medicinal substances. Why, though dwelling where all others shun, does it nearly approach the Dao? Within Kan lies return, the return to the root and restoration of life.
Dwelling in good earth: first, one must obtain the proper place.
The mind in profound depth: first, one must practice non-action.
Giving with goodwill: first, one must choose companions wisely.
Speaking with good faith: one dare not lose the proper time.
Governing with good order: enriching the state and pacifying the people.
Handling affairs with good skill: strengthening the army and securing victory.
Moving with good timing: morning in *tun*, evening in *meng*.
Dare not contend for profit to gain strength.
Contention brings fault; only by not contending does one remain free from blame.

**Chapter Nine: Holding to Fullness**
Holding to fullness is not as good as stopping in time.
Sharpening to a point cannot be long preserved.
When gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them.
Wealth and nobility with arrogance bring one’s own downfall.
To withdraw when the work is done, the name achieved, and the self preserved—this is the Dao of heaven.

The Classic says: Holding to fullness—when gold and jade fill the hall—is not as good as stopping in time; none can guard them. Sharpening to a point—wealth and nobility with arrogance—cannot be long preserved; they bring one’s own downfall. To withdraw when the work is done, the name achieved, and the self preserved—this is the Dao of heaven.

The Dao says: The Dao of heaven diminishes the full and augments the humble; the Dao of earth transforms the full and flows to the humble; ghosts and spirits harm the full and bless the humble; the human Dao detests the full and favors the humble. Thus Kan does not fill—only when the banks are level is there no fault. When full, the Dao of Kan is lost—thus it is not as good as stopping in time. Affairs with pointed edges are not perfectly formed; sharpening to a point will surely blunt its edge—thus it cannot be long preserved. When gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them; holding to fullness—wealth and nobility with arrogance—brings one’s own downfall, for it is sharpening to a point. Thus, to withdraw when the work is done, the name achieved, and the self preserved—this is the Dao of heaven.

Virtue says: Essence and qi become things; wandering souls bring change. Thus one knows the conditions of ghosts and spirits—the Dao of holding to fullness while nurturing the po. Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen: the moon is full at *jia*; sun and moon face each other—this is the time for holding and guarding. Exceed it, and it wanes. Thus the sun, when full, declines; the moon, when full, is eclipsed. Heaven and earth wax and wane with time’s ebb and flow. Those who seize the workings of creation do not act thus: when the moon is full, when gold and jade fill the hall, why hold to fullness and guard achievement? To retreat and hide in secrecy is sufficient. This is the Dao of heaven. To advance further is like the dragon soaring too high—regret follows, for it has sharpened its point. Thus, to dwell in high position without arrogance: if one dwells above and is arrogant, who is to blame for the downfall?

**Chapter Ten: Nurturing the Po**
Can you nurture the po and embrace the One without separation?
Can you concentrate qi to attain softness, like a newborn babe?
Can you cleanse and purify your profound mirror, leaving no blemish?
Can you love the people and govern the state without action?
Can you open and close the gates of heaven without acting as the female?
Can you comprehend the four directions without knowledge?
Give life and nourish,
Give life yet do not possess,
Act yet do not rely,
Lead yet do not dominate—
This is called profound virtue.

The Classic says: The sun nurtures, the moon embodies the po—can you embrace the One without separation? Yang qi attains softness—can you be like a newborn babe? Cleanse and purify the profound mirror—can you leave no blemish? Love the people and govern the state—can you do so without action? Open and close the gates of heaven—can you do so without acting as the female? Comprehend the four directions—can you do so without knowledge?

The Dao gives birth to it, and virtue nurtures it.
Thus, it is born yet does not possess itself,
Acts yet does not rely on itself,
Nourishes yet does not dominate—
This is called profound virtue.

The Dao speaks:
When the sun and moon align in measure,
Meeting at the heavens and earth—
Though one speaks of embracing the One,
Can one truly remain undivided?

The sun and moon align in measure—
The *li* of *kǎn*’s separation;
Embrace the Primordial, guard the One—
The *li* of attachment;
Fifty-nine days and they reunite—
The *li* of parting.

*Li* is the utmost refinement.
Within *kǎn*, one yang—
The concentrated *qi* of *qián*—
Thus the moon bears the *yíng* and the *pò*.
Within *li*, one yin—
The yielding *qi* of *kūn*—
Thus the sun is eclipsed.

Having generated *qián* and *kūn*, the heavens and earth,
*Kǎn* and *li* emerge—
The Dao of sun and moon.
Thus, at dusk, it turns aside to death,
At new moon, it completes to life—
Can one be like a newborn babe?

Gazing with the profound—
Its origin is without blemish;
Purifying and cleansing—
Can one leave no flaw?

The people and the state—
Their origin is without action;
Loving and governing them—
Can one act without doing?

*Qián* is the Heavenly Gate—
Its origin is without the female;
Opening and closing it—
Can one do so without the female?

Fourfold and eightfold passage—
Its origin is without knowing;
Illuminating and clarifying—
Can one do so without knowing?

The Heavenly Dao gives birth to it,
The Earthly virtue nurtures it—
Thus it is said:
Born yet not possessing,
Acting yet not relying,
Nourishing yet not dominating—
This is called profound virtue.

Virtue speaks:
When *qián* and *kūn* intermingle, *kǎn* and *li* are born;
When *kǎn* and *li* intermingle, *qián* and *kūn* return—
Thus it is said: the moon bears the *yíng* and *pò*.

Within *kūn*, *qián* intermingles to form *kǎn*’s one yang—
Embracing its One.
Within *qián*, *kūn* intermingles to form *li*’s one yin—
Thus it is said: embracing the One yet undivided.

*Kǎn* is yin without, yang within—
Its essence is *kūn*,
Yet it draws from *qián*’s center to become the inner male.
*Li* is yang without, yin within—
Its essence is *qián*,
Yet it draws from *kūn*’s center to become the inner female.

Through the inner male’s concentration,
The inner female’s yielding generates the babe—
Thus the return.
The union of father and mother generates all things—
Thus it is said: can one be like a newborn babe?

The Purple Yang says:
To hold *kǎn*’s center firm,
To transmute *li*’s inner yin—
This is it.

As for purifying the profound gaze,
Opening and closing the Heavenly Gate—
These are the babe’s essence.
If one relies on them,
It burdens profound virtue.

**Thirty-Spoke Chapter, the Eleventh**

Thirty spokes converge at one hub—
When there is nothing,
The wheel’s use is complete.
Clay is molded into vessels—
When there is nothing,
The vessel’s use is complete.
Doors and windows are carved for rooms—
When there is nothing,
The room’s use is complete.

Thus, having is for advantage,
Nothingness is for use.

The Classic says:
Thirty spokes converge at one hub,
When hollow and turning,
The wheel’s use is complete.
Clay is molded into vessels,
The potter’s form is hollow within—
The vessel’s use is complete.
Doors and windows are carved for rooms,
Though pierced and hollowed,
When empty and bright,
The room’s use is complete.

Thus, what is solid and has form is for advantage,
What is hollow and without is for use.

The Dao speaks:
The Heavenly Circuit, three hundred sixty-five degrees,
Twenty-eight mansions in total—
Like the North Star,
Residing in place while all stars gather to it—
The image of spokes and hub.

The North Pole’s *Tiāngōng*,
Turning within one degree—
The image of nothingness.

Revolving through the twenty-eight mansions,
To harmonize the Seven Governors—
The wheel’s use.

Thus, the use of things is the wheel;
The wheel’s use is emptiness.

Heaven like a tilted canopy,
Earth below, east and south—
The image of molding clay into vessels.

The rivers and seas rule over all valleys,
Because they excel in descending—
The image of nothingness.

They make the great *qi* swell and wane—
The image of vessels.

Thus, the use of things is the vessel;
The vessel’s use is receptivity.

Heaven and Earth fix their positions,
Sun and moon shine together—
The image of doors and windows for rooms.

Empty rooms generate whiteness—
The image of nothingness.

All things arise together—
The room’s use.

Thus, the use of things is the room;
The room’s use is repose.

Therefore, what is solid and has form is advantage;
What is hollow and without is use.

Thus, great fullness seems like emptiness—
Its use is inexhaustible.

Virtue speaks:
At dawn of the new moon, *Tún* governs affairs,
At dusk, *Méng* receives its charge—
Day and night, one hexagram each—
Used in proper sequence.

Excluding *qián*, *kūn*, *kǎn*, and *li*’s four cardinals,
One month, thirty days, and sixty hexagrams are used—
Thus it is said: thirty spokes converge at one hub.

Between them, emptiness and fullness depend on each other,
Form and use support each other,
Advance and retreat follow in turn,
Water and fire pursue each other—
When there is nothing, the wheel’s use is complete.

As for embracing the Primordial, guarding the One,
Ten months, the embryo rounds—
The image of molding clay into vessels.

Empty and detached, entering and exiting without resistance—
The image of the vessel’s use.

Circulating through the Six *Jiǎ*,
Aligning with Heaven and Earth,
Carving doors and windows for rooms—
Life and essence both complete,
Spirit and form both refined,
Changing and transforming, merging with the Dao’s truth—
The image of the room’s use.

Thus, having is for advantage,
Nothingness is for use.

**Five Colors Chapter, the Twelfth**

**The Chapter of the Five Colors, the Thirteenth**

The five colors blind the eyes,
The five tones deafen the ears,
The five flavors dull the palate,
Galloping hunts drive the heart to madness,
Rare treasures disrupt conduct.
Thus, the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes—
He discards the former, takes the latter.

The Classic says:
The five colors delight the eyes, yet blind them;
The five tones delight the ears, yet deafen them;
The five flavors delight the mouth, yet dull it;
Hunting delights the heart, yet drives it mad;
Rare treasures disrupt conduct.
Thus, the Sage does not act for the eyes but for the belly—
He discards their illusions, takes their truth.

The Way says:
Heaven and Earth are thieves of all things,
All things are thieves of humanity,
Humanity is thief of all things.
When the three thieves are at ease, the Three Powers are at peace—
Thus, eating in season, the hundred bones are harmonized,
The mechanism moves, and all transformations are at rest.

If one does not pluck colors to gaze upon, the eyes remain clear;
If one does not listen to sounds, the ears remain keen;
If one does not indulge in meats and grains, the palate remains sharp;
If one does not chase beasts without restraint, the heart remains calm;
If one does not squander on treasures, conduct remains unobstructed.
Thus, the Sage does not act for the eyes but for the belly—
He discards their false allure, takes the belly’s true use.

Virtue says:
Of the five colors, only yellow is true to observe—
Black and red are false, blinding the eyes.
Of the five tones, only *gōng* is true to hear—
*shāng* and *jué* are false, deafening the ears.
Of the five flavors, only sweetness is true to eat—
Sour and bitter are false, dulling the palate.
To gallop in hunts between birds and hares, without measure,
Is folly that drives the heart to madness.
To covet the *lízóng* pearl as rare treasure,
Yet fail to obtain it—reduced to dust—
What harm beyond obstructed conduct?

Thin wine surpasses tea,
Coarse cloth surpasses nakedness,
An ugly wife surpasses an empty bed—
This is true nourishment of the belly, not the eyes.
Thus, discard the former, take the latter.

**The Chapter of Honor and Humiliation, the Fourteenth**

Honor and humiliation are like a shock,
Great calamity is like the body itself.

What is meant by honor and humiliation?
Honor is lowly—
To gain it is a shock,
To lose it is a shock—
This is called honor and humiliation like a shock.

What is meant by valuing great calamity as the body?
My great calamity arises from having a body—
When I have no body, what calamity remains?
Thus, to hold the body as the world’s treasure,
One may entrust it to the world;
To love the body as the world’s treasure,
One may commit it to the world.

The Classic says:
Honor and humiliation are like a shock,
Great calamity is like the body itself.
Honor is lowly—
To gain honor is a shock,
To lose humiliation is also a shock—
This is called honor and humiliation like a shock.
Great honor lies in the body,
Great calamity lies in the body—
If one has no calamity, it is as if one has no body.
If one holds the body as the world’s treasure,
One may entrust it to the world;
If one loves the body as the world’s treasure,
One may commit it to the world—
This is called having no body.

The Way says:
The *jiǔwǔ* flying dragon ascends to Heaven,
Favorable to seeing the great person—
Like voices resonating, like *qi* seeking its kind,
Water flows to moisture, fire seeks dryness,
Clouds follow the dragon, winds follow the tiger.
The Sage acts, and all things behold—
This is receiving Heaven’s honor.
To align with Heaven and Earth in virtue,
To align with the sun and moon in luminosity—
To gain this is a shock.
The *shàngjiǔ* soaring dragon regrets—
Honored yet without position,
Elevated yet without people,
The worthy in low station with no aid—
Thus, action brings regret.
Movement generates one *yīn* below, forming *xiù*—
Regret and blame are symbols of worry and anxiety—
Thus, loss is a shock.
If the *jiǔwǔ* does not possess its body as the world’s honor,
It must long dwell in *jiǔwǔ*, never reaching *shàngjiǔ*’s great calamity—
This is called honor and humiliation like a shock.
Thus, he who holds the body as the world’s treasure
May entrust it to the world;
He who loves the body as the world’s treasure
May commit it to the world.
Thus, without possessing the body, there is no calamity—
This is clear.

Virtue says:
Know the male, guard the female—
To gain this is a shock.
To confront the enemy lightly in battle—
No greater humiliation exists.
To gain and not lose is great honor in the body;
To lose and not gain is great calamity in the body.
With action, there is a body—
Necessarily, great calamity follows;
Without action, there is no body—
Necessarily, great honor follows.
When the people are both rich and numerous,
One’s own body may be treasured and loved—
To benefit the people as they benefit themselves is to treasure the body;
To use the people as they use themselves is to love the body.
Thus, the Sage does not dare to hold the body as the world’s treasure,
Yet may entrust it to the world;
Does not dare to love the body as the world’s treasure,
Yet may commit it to the world.
This is called the noble love of having no body.

**The Chapter of the Unseen, the Fifteenth**

What is unseen when viewed is called *yí*,
What is unheard when listened to is called *xī*,
What is ungrasped when seized is called *wēi*.
These three cannot be forced or questioned—
Thus, they merge into one.
Above, it is not bright,
Below, it is not dark.
Faint and indistinct, beyond naming—
Returning to nothingness.
This is called the form of no form,
The image of no image—
This is called *hūhuǎng*.
Approach it, and you see no head;
Follow it, and you see no tail.
Hold the ancient Way to govern the present.
To know the ancient beginning is called the *jì* of the Way.

The Classic says:
What is unseen is not blindness,
What is unheard is not deafness,
What is ungrasped is not slowness.
The three—*yí*, *xī*, *wēi*—
Merge into one, the existence of non-existence—
Thus, they cannot be reached by speech or question.
Above, it is not bright,
Below, it is not dark—
Piercing emptiness, round and luminous,
Internally and externally clear—
Faint and indistinct, beyond naming,
Yet returning to nothingness—
This is called the form of no form,
The image of no image—
This is called *hūhuǎng*.

This is called *hūhuǎng*—
Approach it, and you see no head;
Follow it, and you see no tail—
Perhaps it cannot be grasped by form or contained.

To hold the ancient Dao’s emptiness and nothingness,
And apply it to govern the present’s tangible reality.
To know the ancient beginning of the Dao,
Is called the *jì* of the present Dao.

The Dao speaks:
Exhaust the principle (*lǐ*), penetrate the nature (*xìng*), and reach the vital essence (*mìng*)—
Thus, when one establishes precepts (*jiè*), one accumulates *jīng* (精).
Accumulating *jīng* allows one to exhaust the principle.
From precepts arises concentration (*dìng*),
Concentration preserves the *qì* (气),
Preserving the *qì* penetrates the nature,
From concentration arises wisdom (*huì*),
Wisdom perfects the spirit (*shén*),
Perfecting the spirit reaches the vital essence.
The three—*yí*, *xī*, *wēi*—
Merge into one, the existence of non-existence—
Thus, they cannot be reached by speech or question.

The *yí* (夷), *xī* (希), and *wēi* (微) are the *hūhuǎng* of sight, hearing, and touch.
Above, it is not bright—
Originally, there is nothing to be bright.
Below, it is not dark—
Originally, there is nothing to be dark.
Thus, faint and indistinct, beyond naming,
Yet returning to nothingness—
This is called the form of no form,
The image of no image—
This is called *hūhuǎng*,
So approach it, and you see no head;
Follow it, and you see no tail—
The nature (*xìng*) thus remains complete and whole.

If one holds the ancient Dao,
And applies it to govern the present’s tangible reality,
Knowing the primordial beginning (*tàishǐ*),
This is called the *jì* of the Dao.

The *virtue/power* (*dé*) speaks:
What Zhuàngzì (紫阳) called—
That which is seen yet cannot be used,
That which is used yet cannot be seen,
Encountered in *hūhuǎng* yet indistinct,
Transforming in the boundless and obscure—
These are the three merged into one,
Which cannot be questioned or reached.
Only when one’s cultivation (*gōngfū*) reaches this point
Does one naturally know it.

Thus, *hūhuǎng* within *hūhuǎng*,
Yet there is something within it;
Boundless and obscure within boundless and obscure,
Yet there is *jīng* (精) within it.
Approach it, and you see no head;
Follow it, and you see no tail—
Thus, it is said to be beyond questioning or reaching.

If one holds this Dao,
And applies it to govern the present’s tangible reality,
First knowing the great beginning,
Then one can act—
Thus, it is called the *jì* of the Dao.

**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Sage’s Seven Transformations**

The ancient sage who excelled in cultivation (*shì* 士)
Was subtle, mysterious, and penetrating,
Deep beyond recognition.

Because it was beyond recognition,
They forced it into seven forms:
At first, hesitant as one crossing a winter river,
Next, tranquil as one fearing the four directions,
Then dignified as a guest,
Then vast as ice about to thaw,
Then solid as uncarved wood,
Then expansive as a valley,
Then pure as turbid water settling.

Who can settle the turbid through stillness, and gradually make it clear?
Who can endure the settled, and over time gradually give rise to life?

Those who preserve this Dao
Do not desire fullness.

Because they do not desire fullness,
They can wear out without ever becoming new—
Their forms remain unchanged.

The Classic says:
The ancient sage who excelled in cultivation (*shì* 士)
Was subtle, mysterious, and penetrating,
Deep beyond recognition.

Because it was beyond recognition,
They forced it into seven forms:
At first, hesitant as one crossing a winter river (*yù yú dōng shè biān*),
Next, tranquil as one fearing the four directions (*yú yú wèi sì lín*),
Then dignified as a guest (*yǎn yǎn ruò kè*),
Then vast as ice about to thaw (*yāng yāng ruò bīng jiāng shì*),
Then solid as uncarved wood (*dūn xī ruò pǔ*),
Then expansive as a valley (*kuàng xī ruò gǔ*),
Then pure as turbid water settling (*hún xī ruò zhuó*).
Their forms undergo seven transformations—
These are forced distinctions.

As for settling the turbid through stillness,
Enduring the settled to gradually give rise to life—
Who can attain this?
This is the spirit (*shén*) of form.

Thus, those who preserve this Dao
Do not desire fullness.

Because they do not desire fullness,
They can wear out without ever becoming new—
Their forms return to the original, unchanging.

The Dao speaks:
Heaven does not speak, yet the four seasons proceed;
Earth does not speak, yet the five phases (*wǔxíng*) harmonize;
Humanity does not speak, yet all affairs are complete—
Thus, the ancient sage who excelled in cultivation (*shì* 士)
Was subtle, mysterious, and penetrating,
Deep beyond recognition,
Possessing the Dao of the Three Powers (*sān cài*).

Because it was beyond recognition,
They forced it into seven forms:
From hesitant as one crossing a winter river
To pure as turbid water settling—
A single transformation becomes seven.

Settling the turbid through stillness,
Enduring the settled to gradually give rise to life—
Seven transformations become nine.

Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness,
Thus, they can wear out without ever becoming new—
Nine transformations return to one.

Great indeed are Laozi’s words!

The sage said of it:
It is like a dragon, is it not?
I do not know how it rides the wind and clouds to ascend to Heaven—
Yet this is perhaps its limit.

The *virtue/power* (*dé*) speaks:
The sage who attains the Dao truly embodies the four *virtues/powers* (*sì dé*).
That which cannot be grasped is called *wēi* (微),
The unfathomable yin and yang is called *miào* (妙),
The transformations of Heaven and Earth are called *xuán* (玄),
The ceaseless coming and going is called *tōng* (通)—
Thus, it is said to be subtle, mysterious, and penetrating,
Deep beyond recognition.

Because it was beyond recognition,
They forced it into seven forms:
Hesitant as one crossing a winter river—
This is cautious yet firm, like stepping on thin ice.
Tranquil as one fearing the four directions—
This is not daring to advance an inch while retreating a foot.
Dignified as a guest—
This is not daring to be the host, but only the guest.
Vast as ice about to thaw—
This is recognizing the heart and seeing the nature.
Solid as uncarved wood—
This is the completion of the *jiǎgēng* (甲庚) cycle.
Expansive as a valley—
This is the opening of the *wùjǐ* (戊己) gate.
Pure as turbid water settling—
This is the birth of *qiān cǎi* (铅采) and *guǐ shēng* (癸生).

Who can settle the turbid through stillness?
This is the Way of the highest goodness, like water.
Who can endure the settled to gradually give rise to life?
This is the ten-month gestation of the embryo.

Those who preserve this Dao
Do not desire fullness—
Fullness reveals the spirit and *jīng* (精).

Because they do not desire fullness,
They can wear out without ever becoming new—
Their forms remain unchanged.

**Chapter Sixteen: The Ultimate Attainment of Emptiness**

To attain the utmost emptiness,
To steadfastly preserve stillness—
When all things arise together,
I observe their return to root.

Things teem and flourish,
Each returning to its origin.
Returning to origin is called *stillness*;
Stillness is called *recovery of vital essence*;
Recovery of vital essence is called *constancy*;
Knowing constancy is called *clarity*.
Ignorance of constancy leads to reckless action—
This is the path of calamity.

Knowing constancy, one can embrace *public virtue*—
Public virtue gives rise to *royal virtue*,
Royal virtue to *heavenly virtue*,
Heavenly virtue to *Dao/Way*,
Dao/Way to enduring longevity—
Thus one’s life is never in peril.

The *Zhēn Dé Jīng* says:
*"To attain the utmost emptiness,
To steadfastly preserve stillness—
When all things arise together,
I observe their return to root."*

Things teem and flourish,
Each returning to its origin.
Returning to origin is called *stillness*—
The place where all things rest.
Stillness is called *recovery of vital essence*—
The birth of *one yang* at the Winter Solstice.
Recovery of vital essence is called *constancy*—
Another full cycle of heaven.
Knowing constancy is called *clarity*—
The four seasons never err.
Ignorance of constancy leads the people astray,
And reckless action brings calamity.

Knowing constancy, one can embrace all things—
This is the *public virtue*,
Public virtue gives rise to *royal virtue*,
Royal virtue to *heavenly virtue*,
Heavenly virtue to *Dao/Way*.
Attaining Dao/Way brings enduring longevity—
Thus one’s life is never in peril.

The *Way* says:
*"The Great Ultimate is hollow within—
This is the attainment of utmost emptiness.
When emptiness is fully attained,
Steadfast stillness is preserved.
Dividing yin and yang,
The Two Principles are established,
Extending to the Four Symbols and Eight Trigrams,
Generating the three hundred and eighty-four *yáo* (爻).
When all things arise together,
The *Qián* (乾) Principle rules them—
I observe their return to root.
The *Kūn* (坤) Principle conceals them—
Thus it is said: Things teem and flourish,
Each returning to its origin.
Returning to origin is called *stillness*—
The resting place of all things.
Stillness is called *recovery of vital essence*—
The birth of *one yang* at the Winter Solstice.
Recovery of vital essence is called *constancy*—
Another full cycle of heaven.
Knowing constancy is called *clarity*—
The four seasons never err.
Ignorance of constancy leads the people astray—
And reckless action brings calamity.
Knowing constancy, one can embrace all things—
This is the *public virtue*,
Public virtue gives rise to *royal virtue*,
Royal virtue to *heavenly virtue*,
Heavenly virtue to *Dao/Way*.
Dao/Way is enduring—
Thus one’s life is never in peril."*

The *Virtue* says:
*"Master Zǐyú (紫阳) spoke:
Things teem and flourish, each returning to its root—
Returning to root recovers vital essence, ensuring eternal life.
The subtle Dao of knowing constancy is hard for people to grasp,
And reckless action often invites calamity.

Governance attains utmost emptiness,
Preserves stillness with utmost steadfastness—
Thus all things arise together,
And I desire to observe their return to root.
Things teem and flourish,
Each returning to its origin,
Yet people are dull and unaware of the recovery of vital essence—
Alas!

Recovery of vital essence is called *constancy*—
Knowing constancy is called *clarity*.
If one knows constancy,
They need not exhaust their *jīng* (精) through labor—
Ignorance of constancy leads them to take recklessness as constancy.
Taking recklessness as constancy,
They drain their *jīng* (精) to depletion,
And scatter their *zhēn* (真)—
Thus calamity follows.
Knowing constancy, one can embrace all things—
This gives rise to *public virtue*,
Public virtue to *royal virtue*,
Royal virtue to *heavenly virtue*,
Heavenly virtue to *Dao/Way*.
Attaining Dao/Way brings enduring longevity—
Thus one’s life is never in peril."*

**Chapter Seventeen: The Supreme Sage**

The Supreme Sage
Does not know of his existence;
The next, cherishes and praises him;
The next, fears and reviles him.
Faith is insufficient—
There is doubt;
Yet this is how the Way becomes esteemed.

When his work is accomplished,
The people say he acted naturally.
The *Zhēn Dé Jīng* says:
*"The Way of the Supreme Sage
Is unknown in his existence.
The next cherishes him, beginning to know his praise.
The next does not cherish him, yet still fears him.
The next does not fear him, but reviles him.
Thus, faith is insufficient—
There is doubt;
Yet this is how the Way becomes esteemed.
When his work is accomplished,
The people say he acted naturally."*

The *Way* says:
*"The Way of the Supreme Sage
Is the Great Ultimate’s single orbit.
Unknown in his existence—
This is the birth of the Two Principles.
The next cherishes and praises him—
The Two Principles give rise to the Four Symbols.
The next fears him—
The Four Symbols give rise to the Eight Trigrams.
Faith is insufficient—
There is doubt—
The Eight Trigrams determine auspiciousness and calamity.
Yet this is how the Way becomes esteemed—
Auspiciousness and calamity generate great undertakings.
When his work is accomplished,
The benevolent see it as benevolence,
The wise see it as wisdom.
The people use it daily, yet do not know—
Thus the Sage’s Way is rare indeed.
Hence it is said: The people call it natural."*

The *Virtue* says:
*"The Way of the Supreme Sage
Is the *one yang* of the southwest.
Observed from below,
One begins to know of his existence.
The next do not know or observe the Way—
They only cherish and praise him.
The next hear of him and fear him—
The next mock and revile him—
Not to mock is insufficient to be the Way.
Alas, the people of the world have no connection to it!
Faith is insufficient—
There is doubt.
The Sage esteems speech,
So that people may know.
When his work is accomplished,
The people say he attained the natural Way—
Yet they do not know the Sage esteems speech."*

**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao in Decay**

When the Great Dao is neglected,
There arise *rén yì* (仁义);
When wisdom and insight emerge,
There arises great deceit;
When the Six Kinships are not in harmony,
There arise filial piety and kindness;
When the state is in chaos,
There arise loyal subjects.

The *Zhēn Dé Jīng* says:
*"The Great Dao does not tolerate *rén yì* (仁义)—
*Rén yì* (仁义) arises from the Great Dao.
Wisdom and insight do not tolerate great deceit—
Great deceit arises from wisdom and insight.
When the Six Kinships are in harmony,
There is no need for filial piety and kindness—
Knowing filial piety and kindness,
One sees the Six Kinships are already not in harmony.
When the state is well-ordered,
There is no need for loyal subjects—
Knowing loyal subjects,
One sees the state is already in chaos.
This is the natural order."*

The *Way* says:
*"When the Great Dao is neglected,
There arise seven virtues—
*Xī Nóng* (羲农) to *Yáo Shùn* (尧舜).
When wisdom and insight emerge,
There arises great deceit—
*Yǔ Tāng* (禹汤) to *Jié Zhòu* (桀纣).
When the Six Kinships are not in harmony,
There arise filial piety and kindness—
*Wén Wǔ* (文武) to *Yōu Lì* (幽厉).
When the state is in chaos,
There arise loyal subjects—
*Huán Wén* (桓文) to *Dìng Āi* (定哀).

When the Great Dao is neglected,
The Sage follows the Three Sovereigns
And establishes the *Zhōu Yì* (周易).
When *rén yì* (仁义) arises,
The Sage upholds the Five Constants
And defines the *Shū* (书).
When wisdom and insight emerge,
The Sage succeeds the Three Kings
And edits the *Shī* (诗).
When great deceit arises,
The Sage is the descendant of the Five Hegemons
And composes the *Chūn Qiū* (春秋),
Within which are filial piety, kindness, and loyal subjects."*

The *Virtue* says:
*"The Great Dao,
Is the great medicine."*

「仁义 (*rén yì*), the graded categories of medicine.
智慧 (*zhì huì*), the refined methods.
大伪 (*dà wěi*), the deviant paths.

When the great medicine is neglected,
One does not lose the graded categories of medicine,
Hence it is said:
*"When the Great Dao is neglected,
仁义 (*rén yì*) arises."*

When refined methods emerge,
There must arise the deviant paths,
Hence it is said:
*"When wisdom and insight arise,
大伪 (*dà wěi*) emerges."*

Medicine meets its kindred *qi* and forms its efficacy,
The Dao aligns with the *Xīyí* (希夷) and harmonizes with nature—
When the Six Kinships are not in harmony,
孝慈 (*xiào cí*, filial piety and kindness) arises.
A single grain of *Jīndān* (金丹, elixir) swallowed into the belly,
One comes to know:
*"My fate is not governed by Heaven,"*
When the state is in chaos,
忠臣 (*zhōng chén*, loyal subjects) arise.

**Chapter Nineteen: Discarding the Sage and Wisdom**
Discarding the Sage and Wisdom,
The people benefit a hundredfold;
Discarding 仁义 (*rén yì*), the people return to filial piety and kindness;
Discarding cleverness and profit,
Bandits and thieves vanish.
These three measures,
Are deemed insufficient for culture,
Thus they are permitted to exist in their own domains.

Embrace simplicity, forsake excess.
The Classic states:
*"Discarding the Sage and Wisdom,
The people benefit a hundredfold;
Discarding 仁义 (*rén yì*), the people return to filial piety and kindness;
Discarding cleverness and profit,
Bandits and thieves vanish.
These three measures,
Are deemed insufficient for written culture,
Thus they are permitted to exist in their own domains.
Embrace simplicity, forsake excess,
And one attains a life of few desires and little greed."*

The Dao says:
*"Discarding the Sage and Wisdom,
The people benefit a hundredfold—
I have no labor, yet the people prosper of themselves.
Discarding 仁义 (*rén yì*), the people return to filial piety and kindness—
I have no desires, yet the people become simple of themselves.
Discarding cleverness and profit,
Bandits and thieves vanish—
Yet laws and decrees multiply,
And bandits and thieves abound.
These three measures are deemed insufficient for cultural institutions,
Thus they are permitted to exist in their own domains."*

The Sage and Wisdom,
Are the domain of the people’s benefit.
仁义 (*rén yì*),
Are the domain of filial piety and kindness.
Cleverness and profit,
Are the domain of bandits and thieves.
Only by seeing the Great Simplicity,
And adhering to the Great Primordial,
Does one attain a life of few desires and little greed,
Without needing cultural teachings to achieve these three outcomes.

**Virtue says:**
*"When the Great Dao is neglected,
仁义 (*rén yì*) arises;
When cleverness and profit emerge,
Bandits and thieves arise—
This is because cultural laws are insufficient,
And thus they are permitted to exist in their own domains."*

The Dao exists before the heavens,
With neither words nor language,
Nor artificial cleverness and profit,
Thus the Sage and Wisdom,
仁义 (*rén yì*) naturally arise within it.
The teachings of *Zǐyáng* (紫阳, Zhu Xi) that regard
*"The cultivation of clever artifices as merit,"*
And that recognize
*"The methods of other schools as not fatal,"*
Are based on this principle.

Only upon encountering the *Sùnǚzǐ* (素女子, plain maiden) of *Tàibái Shān* (太白山),
And embracing the Primordial Simplicity of the preheavenly,
Does one naturally attain few desires and little greed.

**Chapter Twenty: Discarding Learning Brings No Worry**

「Only *yī* (唯) and *ē* (阿) differ—how far apart are they?
How distant is *shàn* (善) from *è* (恶)?
What people fear, one must fear—
Boundless! Its end is unfathomable.

The multitude bustles and rejoices,
As if feasting on the grandest sacrificial meat,
As if ascending to the Spring Platform.
I alone am calm and undisturbed—
No sign yet of my form,
Like an infant yet to be nurtured,
Pure and simple, as if belonging nowhere.

The multitude all have excess,
Yet I alone seem abandoned.
Is my heart that of a foolish man?
Muddled and unknowing.

The common folk are bright and clear,
I alone seem dim and confused.
The common folk are sharp and discerning,
I alone am dull and murky.
Suddenly obscured, silent—
As if there were no end to it.

The multitude all have purpose,
I alone am stubborn and base.
I alone differ from others,
Yet honor nourishment from the Mother.

The text says: *"Discarding learning brings no worry.*
If one reaches *yī* (唯) and *ē* (阿),
How far apart are they?
Even to *shàn* (善) and *è* (恶),
How distant are they?
What people fear, one must fear—
If truly fearless,
One drifts into boundless ruin—
Its end is unfathomable.

The multitude bustles and rejoices,
As if feasting on the grandest sacrificial meat,
As if ascending to the Spring Platform.
I alone am serene—
No sign yet of my form,
Like an infant, yet to receive nurture,
Pure and simple, as if belonging nowhere.
The multitude all taste the world’s pleasures,
Claiming they have enough—
Yet I alone am like one who has been left behind.
Am I truly a foolish man?
Muddled and unknowing,
I alone seek to cultivate the Great Dao.

Bright and clear, sharp and discerning—
Even if they fear not evil,
I alone am dim and confused,
Still fearing dispersion and loss.
Thus suddenly obscured,
Like the moon in its darkest phase,
Life and death intertwined,
Silent and vast—
As if there were no end to it.

Faint and hazy, yet within it there must be something to ride upon—
The multitude grasp it, all having purpose.
I alone am stubborn and base.
Firm and refined, enduring ten thousand *jié* (劫, kalpas),
Then casting off illusions,
Returning to true emptiness,
Transforming and changing with the Dao’s essence—
This is my difference from others,
For in the beginning, I sought nourishment from the Mother.

Thus it is said: *"All under heaven are my daughters, the Mother."*
**Chapter Twenty-One: The Form of Perfect Virtue/Power**
The form of perfect virtue/power follows only the Dao.
The Dao as a thing is but faint and hazy.
Faint and hazy—
Within it are forms.
Faint and hazy—
Within it are essences.
Deep and mysterious—
Within it is the vital essence, most true,
Within it is trust.
From ancient times to now,
Its name never fades,
To observe the multitude of common folk.

How do I know they are thus?
By this.
The text says: *"Perfect virtue/power takes form,
Following only the Dao.
The Dao as a thing is faint and hazy.
Faint and hazy—
Within it are forms.
Faint and hazy—
Within it are essences.
Deep and mysterious—
Within it is the vital essence.
Mysterious and deep—
Within it is trust.
Its vital essence is most true,
Its trust is most enduring.
Forms, essences, vital essence, and trust—
Faint and hazy, deep and mysterious.
From ancient times to now,
Its name never fades,
Thus observing the multitude of beauties.

How do I know they are thus?
By this path of vital essence and trust.»

The Dao speaks:
*"When virtue/power is embodied, it is round and divine;
When virtue/power is manifested in the trigrams, it is square and knowing—
Both are the interplay of one yin and one yang, thus it is said: 'Only the Dao is followed.'

The Dao, as a thing, is unseen yet hazy, unknown yet formless,
Unseen yet hazy, unknown yet containing essence—
Thus, those who practice virtue/power and trust without ceasing
Perceive the Dao within the depths of mystery.
Hence, from ancient times to now,
Its name never fades.

To observe its subtlety without desire,
Ever profound, entering the gate of all mysteries—
This is the way.

Virtue/power declares:
*'When humans study the Dao,
There is no virtue/power to contain it—
Only the Dao is followed,
The vastness of Confucian virtue/power.*

Before Heaven as a thing, it meets in hazy obscurity;
Before Heaven as a form, it appears in hazy indistinctness.
The vital essence of Before Heaven is obtained in the depths of mystery—
Its essence is most true;
The trust of Before Heaven is obtained in the depths of mystery—
Its trust is most enduring.
Thus, from ancient times to now,
The names of lead and mercury never fade,
To observe the multitude’s nature.

How do I know their nature is beautiful?
By this lead and mercury of Before Heaven.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: The Curved Becomes Whole**
The curved becomes whole,
The bent becomes straight,
The hollow becomes full,
The worn becomes renewed,
The few become sufficient,
The many become confused.
Thus, the Sage embraces *One* as the model for all under Heaven.

Not self-illuminating, hence clear;
Not self-righteous, hence manifest;
Not self-praising, hence effective;
Not self-glorifying, hence enduring.
Only by not contending does one surpass all contention.
Was the ancient saying 'the curved becomes whole' mere empty words?
Truly, it is whole and returns to this.

The text says:
*'The curved becomes whole,
The bent becomes straight,
The hollow becomes full,
The worn becomes renewed,
The few become sufficient,
The many become confused—
The Dao of gain and loss, flourishing and decline.*
Thus, the Sage embraces *One* as the model for all under Heaven.

Not self-illuminating, hence able to enlighten;
Not self-righteous, hence able to manifest;
Not self-praising, hence able to achieve;
Not self-glorifying, hence able to endure.
Only this non-contention—
Thus, none under Heaven can contend with it.
Was the ancient saying 'the curved becomes whole' mere empty words?
Truly, it is whole and returns to this.

The Dao speaks:
*'The caterpillar’s bending seeks truth,
The dragon’s coiling preserves life,
Refined essence enters the divine to fulfill its use,
Useful application secures life to elevate virtue/power.
First it bends and twists,
Then it becomes whole and straight;
First it hollows and wears,
Then it fills and renews;
First it is few,
Then it suffices;
First it is many,
Then it confuses—
The Dao of waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness.
Thus, the Sage embraces *One* as the unifying thread,
And becomes the model revered by all under Heaven.

*One* does not self-illuminate, hence able to use all under Heaven’s clarity;
*One* does not self-righteous, hence able to use all under Heaven’s manifestation;
*One* does not self-praise, hence able to use all under Heaven’s achievements;
*One* does not self-glorify, hence able to use all under Heaven’s endurance.
Only this non-contention—
Thus, none under Heaven can contend with it.
Was this mere empty words?
Truly, it is whole and returns to this.

Virtue/power declares:
*'The most straight seems bent,
The most skillful seems clumsy,
The most eloquent seems tongue-tied—
Thus, softness overcomes hardness,
Weakness overcomes strength—
This is the natural order.*
Zhu Xi said:
*'Only by turning the door of death into the door of life,
Do not mistake the gate of life for the gate of death.
If one understands the mechanism of killing turned upside down,
Only then does one know that harm harbors hidden blessing.*
This is the curved becoming whole.

Thus, the Sage embraces the *One* of the Supreme Ultimate,
As the hidden dragon not yet acting—
Firmly established, unshakable—
And becomes the model revered by all under Heaven.
Hence, those who self-illuminate are not clear,
Those who self-righteous are not manifest,
Those who self-praise achieve nothing,
Those who self-glorify do not endure.
Only these two words—*non-contention*—
Can traverse all under Heaven without rival,
Thus, the saying 'the curved becomes whole'—
Was it mere empty words?
Truly, it is whole and returns to this.

**Chapter Twenty-Three: The Few Words of Nature**
...

**Chapter Twenty-Three: The Few Words of Nature (continued)**
---

The Way of few words and naturalness.
The gusting wind does not last through the morning,
The sudden rain does not last through the day.
Who does this for? The Heaven and Earth.
Heaven and Earth cannot even endure this,
How much less can man?

Thus, those who follow the **Dao/Way**,
Those in **Dao/Way** align with **Dao/Way**,
Those in **virtue/power** align with **virtue/power**,
Those in loss align with loss.
Those who align with **Dao/Way**, **Dao/Way** is also theirs;
Those who align with **virtue/power**, **virtue/power** is also theirs;
Those who align with loss, loss is also theirs.
Faith is insufficient, there will be doubt.
The **Classics** say:
*"To speak of the subtle and the few—
This is the natural Way of **Dao/Way**.*
The gusting wind does not last through the morning,
The sudden rain does not last through the day.
Who does this for? Heaven and Earth.
Heaven and Earth cannot even endure this,
How much less can man?
Thus, those who follow the **Dao/Way**,
Those in **Dao/Way** align with **Dao/Way**,
Those in **virtue/power** align with **virtue/power**,
Even those in loss align with loss.
Thus, those who align with **Dao/Way**, **Dao/Way** is also theirs;
Those who align with **virtue/power**, **virtue/power** is also theirs;
Those who align with loss, loss is also theirs.
Yet still, faith is insufficient,
There will be doubt.
The **Dao/Way** says:
*The gusting wind and sudden rain—
This is what Heaven and Earth do,
Yet they cannot even last through the day.
How much less can man endure?
Heaven and Earth’s wind and rain,
Though gusting and sudden, have fixed measures.
Yet wind and rain cannot endure long—
This too is the natural Way of Heaven and Earth,
Hence, the Way of few words and naturalness.*

Therefore, those who follow this in **Dao/Way**,
Align with **Dao/Way** and **Dao/Way** is also theirs;
Those who follow this in **virtue/power**,
Align with **virtue/power** and **virtue/power** is also theirs;
Even those who follow this in loss,
Align with loss and loss is also theirs.
If faith is insufficient, doubt arises,
This is what is called:
*"To pass by in front and miss the mark,
To create false life and false death,
And thus decay like grass and wood—
Alas!"*

**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Lame Do Not Stand**
---

The lame do not stand,
The limping do not walk.
Those who self-illuminate are not clear,
Those who self-righteous are not manifest,
Those who self-praise achieve nothing,
Those who self-glorify do not endure.
In **Dao/Way**, this is called:
*"Excessive food and superfluous actions,
Things may detest them,
Thus, those in **Dao/Way** do not dwell here."*

The **Classics** say:
*"The foot limping cannot stand,
The thigh straddling cannot walk.
Those who self-illuminate are not clear,
Those who self-righteous are not manifest,
Those who self-praise achieve nothing,
Those who self-glorify do not endure.
In **Dao/Way**, this is called:
'The remnants of food, the excrescences of action,
Things may detest them,
Thus, those in **Dao/Way** do not dwell here.'"*

The **Dao/Way** says:
*"The one-eyed can see,
Yet cannot have true clarity;
The one-legged can tread,
Yet cannot truly walk—
How much less can the lame and the limping?"*

**Shun** opened the four gates,
Illuminated the four eyes,
Attained the four ears,
Thus, the **suffused fillets** closed his eyes—
*Not seeing yet seeing,*
The **earplugs** sealed his ears—
*Not manifest yet manifest.*
**Shun** also commanded **Yu**, saying:
*"You alone do not boast,
None under Heaven can contest your ability;
You alone do not praise yourself,
None under Heaven can contest your merit."*

In **Dao/Way**, this is called:
*"The remnants of action and inaction,
The excrescences of governance and morality,
Things may detest them—
Thus, those in **Dao/Way** do not dwell here."*

**Virtue/Power** says:
*"The lame do not stand—
This is the solitary purity and few stillness.
The limping do not walk—
This is the solitary yin and few yang.
How can they walk?"*

**Zi Yang** said:
*"One must know the Great Concealment dwells in the marketplace,
Do not merely hide in deep mountains to guard stillness in solitude."*

Thus:
*"Those who self-illuminate are not clear,
Those who self-righteous are not manifest,
Those who self-praise achieve nothing,
Those who self-glorify do not endure.
In **Dao/Way**, this is called:
'The remnants of food—
This is swallowing saliva and inhaling qi;
The excrescences of action—
This is sitting idle and inviting illness;
Things may detest them,
Thus, those in **Dao/Way** do not dwell here.'"*

**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Primordial Mixture**
---

There is a **Primordial Mixture** that coalesces,
Born before Heaven and Earth.
Silent and boundless,
It stands alone yet does not change,
Circulates endlessly yet does not falter,
It can be the **Mother of All under Heaven**,
I do not know its name—
Call it **Dao/Way**,
Forcefully name it **Great**.
**Great** means to pass,
To pass means to go far,
To go far means to return.
Thus, **Dao/Way** is **Great**,
Heaven is **Great**,
Earth is **Great**,
The **King** is also **Great**.
Within the realm, there are four **Great**,
And the **King** occupies one of them.
Man follows Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows **Dao/Way**,
**Dao/Way** follows naturalness.

The **Classics** say:
*"There is a **Primordial Mixture** that coalesces,
Born before Heaven and Earth.
Silent and boundless,
It stands alone yet does not change,
Circulates endlessly yet does not falter,
It can be the **Mother of All under Heaven**,
The supreme treasure before Heaven and Earth.
I do not know its name—
Call it **Dao/Way**,
Forcefully name it **Great**.
**Great** must pass,
Passing must go far,
Going far must return—
The Way of returning to the original and completing the end.
Thus, **Dao/Way** is **Great**,
Heaven is **Great**,
Earth is **Great**,
The **King** is also **Great**.
Within the realm, there are four **Great**,
And the **King** occupies one of them—
The master of **Dao/Way**."*

「The human follows Earth, Earth follows Heaven, Heaven follows **Dao/Way**, **Dao/Way** follows naturalness—**Dao/Way** is the divine essence.

**Dao/Way** speaks:
*"Within the **Supreme Ultimate**'s void (*太极之虚*), there exists a divine substance (*神物*), coalescing in **Primordial Mixture** (*混然而成*), born before Heaven and Earth yet establishing the **Two Principles** (*两仪*). Silent and boundless in the realm of **Non-existence** (*无有之乡*), it emerges as the first among all things (*庶物*), standing alone yet unchanging in its essence (*色*), circulating endlessly without faltering (*周行而不殆*). Indeed, it can be the **Mother of All under Heaven** (*万物之母*), so the Sage names it **Dao/Way** and forcefully calls it **Great** (*大*).

**Great** indeed is the **Primordial Mixture** (*乾元*)! All things derive their beginning from it—thus it unifies Heaven. Clouds move and rain falls, and all things take shape in their forms (*品物流形*). The **Great Brightness** (*大明*) completes the beginning, and the six positions (*六位*) of time are thus formed—hence it is called **Great**.

**Great** means to pass (*逝*), passing means to go far (*远*), going far means to return (*反*), and the **Way** of returning after **shedding and renewal** (*剥反*) is **restoration**.

Thus, **Dao/Way** is **Great**—the divine essence has no bounds, and **Ease** (*易*) has no fixed form (*体*). Heaven is **Great**—how can it be spoken of? The four seasons move therein. Earth is **Great**—it follows and sustains Heaven, and all things grow therefrom. The **King** is also **Great**—Heaven created the **primitive chaos** (*草昧*), and it is fitting to establish **feudal lords** (*侯*) yet it remains restless. Within the realm, there are four **Great**—and the **King** occupies one of them, the master of humanity.

The human follows Earth, Earth follows Heaven, Heaven follows **Dao/Way**, **Dao/Way** follows naturalness—this is the **application** (*用*) of humanity.

**Great** indeed are the words of the Sage!

**Virtue/Power** (*德*) speaks:
*"Within the **Supreme Ultimate**'s circle (*太极圈中*), there exists a divine substance (*神物*), weighing one **jin** (*斤*) sixteen **liang** (*两*), zero three hundred and eighty-four **zhu** (*铢*), which takes five thousand four hundred and forty years and five thousand four hundred and forty days to coalesce (*结成*). Its form is like a chicken’s egg, its color resembles cinnabar (*丹砂*), its brilliance matches the **radiant sun** (*皦日*), its taste surpasses **sweet dew** (*甘露*). It is born before Heaven and Earth yet completes itself after them. Heaven and Earth obtain it and give birth to all things; the Sage obtains it and gives birth to all people. Though silent and boundless, it stands alone yet does not alter its transformations (*变*), though it circulates fully and begins to act (*启行*), it does not endanger its **manifestations** (*化*). It can be the **Mother of All under Heaven** (*天下民物之母*)—divine, how divine! So the Sage names it **Dao/Way** and forcefully calls it **Great** (*大*).

**Great** means it must pass (*逝*), passing means it must go far (*远*), going far means it must return (*反*)—yet it does not return far. Heaven, in its beginning of creation (*始生*), speaks from above to below, and the **King** is its master as well."*

Earth, having completed its formation, speaks from below to above, and the **King** is also its master.

That which Heaven and Earth generate is the **Dao/Way**. The **King’s** central governing heart is the Sage’s ultimate attainment of principle, nature, and fate.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: "Heavy as the Root of Light"**
Heavy serves as the root of light; stillness is the sovereign of agitation.
Thus, the virtuous person moves all day without straying from his baggage train.
Though adorned with splendid sights, he rests in serene detachment.
How can the ruler of ten thousand chariots bear the weight of the world lightly?
Lightness loses his ministers; agitation loses his sovereignty.

The Classic says:
*"Heavy is the root of light; stillness is the sovereign of agitation."*
Thus, the virtuous person moves all day without straying from his baggage train—
so that the ruler of ten thousand chariots may bear the world lightly without losing his ministers.
Though adorned with splendid sights, he rests in serene detachment—
so that agitation may not overthrow his sovereignty.

To act with lightness is to lose his ministers;
to act with agitation is to lose his sovereignty.

The **Dao/Way** says:
*"A tree as thick as an embrace begins as a tiny sprout—
heavy is the root of light.
Purity and stillness govern all under Heaven—
stillness is the sovereign of agitation."*

Thus, the virtuous person moves all day without straying from his baggage train,
fearing to be burdened by lightness and agitation.
Though adorned with splendid sights, he observes lightness through heaviness.
He rests in serene detachment, conquering agitation through stillness.

How can the ruler of ten thousand chariots bear the world lightly?
For a heavy body is the foundation of lightness;
a still ruler of ten thousand chariots is the sovereign of agitation.

Lightness is but branch and leaf;
heaviness is root and foundation.
Speaking of external things:
What originates from Heaven clings to the upper—
branches and leaves are above, so lightness is the sovereign of heaviness.
What originates from Earth clings to the lower—
roots and foundations are below, so heaviness is the minister of lightness.

If one clings to lightness in action, he will surely lose his heavy ministers—
thus it is said: *"Lightness loses his ministers."*
Speaking of the ruler of ten thousand chariots:
Stillness is non-action; agitation is action.
If I act with non-action, the people transform themselves;
non-action above, so stillness is the sovereign of agitation.
If I act with action, the people fall into disorder;
action below, so agitation is the minister of stillness.

If one clings to agitation in action, he will surely lose his still sovereign—
thus it is said: *"Agitation loses his sovereignty."*

The **Virtue/Power** says:
*"Pure Yang declares:
The **Dao/Way** originates from emptiness and non-being, a single breath (*qi*).
It generates Heaven, Earth, and humankind—
all from this vital essence and spirit.
Creation never departs from the Mysterious Female.
The Mysterious Female’s gate is called the root of Heaven and Earth—
thus, heavy is the root of light.

True Yang declares:
The wondrous **Dharma** has three thousand six hundred gates;
each practitioner clings to one as root.
Who knows the true method of immortality?
It lies not in the three thousand six hundred gates—
thus, stillness is the sovereign of agitation."*

Thus, the virtuous person moves all day without straying from his baggage train—
just as the ruler of ten thousand chariots bears the world lightly.
Though adorned with splendid sights, his mind remains undisturbed.
He rests in serene detachment, forgetting both self and environment.

Lightness loses his ministers—
the foundation is unstable, harming the supreme elixir.
Agitation loses his sovereignty—
the fire’s intensity is excessive, harming the primal yang.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: "The Virtuous Walk Leaves No Tracks"**
The virtuous walk leaves no tracks;
virtuous speech has no flaws;
virtuous planning requires no calculations;
virtuous closure needs no locks yet cannot be opened;
virtuous binding needs no cords yet cannot be undone.

Thus, the Sage constantly aids people, so none are abandoned;
constantly aids things, so none are discarded.
This is called *"inheriting clarity."*

Therefore, the good person is the teacher of the unvirtuous;
the unvirtuous are the resources of the good.
To not honor one’s teacher, to not cherish one’s resources—
though wise, this is called great confusion.
This is called *"the essential mystery."*

The Classic says:
*"No tracks are seen—this is called virtuous walking.
No flaws are seen—this is called virtuous speech.
No calculations are used—this is called virtuous planning.
Virtuous closure needs no locks yet cannot be opened;
virtuous binding needs no cords yet cannot be undone."*

Thus, the Sage constantly aids people, so none are abandoned;
constantly aids things, so none are discarded.
This is called *"inheriting clarity."*

Therefore, the good person is the teacher of the unvirtuous;
the unvirtuous are the resources of the good.
To not honor the good as one’s teacher,
to not cherish the unvirtuous as one’s resources—
though called wisdom, it is great confusion.
To return to simplicity after confusion—
this is called *"the essential mystery."*

The **Dao/Way** says:
*"Spring, summer, autumn, and winter—
Heaven’s four treasuries—
this is virtuous walking leaving no tracks.
The *Book of Changes*, *Book of Documents*, *Book of Poetry*, and *Spring and Autumn Annals*—
the Sage’s four treasuries—
this is virtuous speech with no flaws.
Growth, decline, harvest, and storage—
this is virtuous planning requiring no calculations.
The Receptive (*Kun*) conceals it—
this is virtuous closure needing no locks yet unopenable.
The Creative (*Qian*) governs it—
this is virtuous binding needing no cords yet unbreakable."*

Thus, the Sage aids people with Heaven and Earth’s eternal **Dao/Way**,
so none are abandoned;
aids things with Heaven and Earth’s eternal **Dao/Way**,
so none are discarded.
This is called *"inheriting clarity."*

What is *"inheriting clarity"*?
If not this, what is it?
To not honor the unvirtuous as one’s teacher,
to not cherish the good as one’s resources—
though one may possess great wisdom,
it is still called great confusion.
To return to simplicity—
this is called *"the essential mystery."*

The **Virtue/Power** says:
*"Daily practice leaves no tracks to follow.
Oral transmission, heart-to-heart—no flaws to request.
Following the seasons to take what is needed—
no calculations are used; this is called virtuous planning.
Without locks yet unopenable—this is called virtuous closure.
Without cords yet unbreakable—this is called virtuous binding.
This is the **Dao/Way** of non-action and stillness."*

Thus, the Sage constantly aids people—
people have the **Dao/Way**, so none are abandoned;

常善救物，物有道，故无弃物。
Thus, the Sage constantly aids all things—
all things have the **Dao/Way**, so none are abandoned;

是谓人物相袭而明，天地之大道也。
This is called *"inheriting clarity"* between humans and things,
the grand **Dao/Way** of heaven and earth.

故善人袭不善人以为资，不善人袭善人以为师，
Thus, the virtuous **inherits clarity** from the unvirtuous as their resources,
and the unvirtuous **inherits clarity** from the virtuous as their teachers,
遂使善与不善俱有大得，
thereby allowing both the virtuous and the unvirtuous to attain great understanding,
亦不贵其师，亦不爱其资，
yet neither honors their teacher nor cherishes their resources.
故人无弃人，物无弃物，
Hence, people abandon no one, and all things are aided.
智而复迷，迷而复智，
Wisdom returns to confusion, and confusion returns to wisdom—
是谓妙道之要也。
this is called the essential mystery of the wondrous **Dao/Way**.

**将欲取天下章第二十九**
The **Chapter on Seeking to Take the World** (29):

将欲取天下而为之，
When one seeks to take the world and **acts** upon it,
吾见其不得已。
I see that it is not inevitable.
天下神器，
The world is a **divine vessel** (*shénqì*),
不可为也。
which cannot be **acted upon**.
为者败之，
To **act** upon it is to **defeat** it,
执者失之。
and to **grasp** it is to **lose** it.
故物或行或随，
Thus, all things either **move** (*xíng*) or **follow** (*suí*),
或煦或吹，
either **warm** (*xù*) or **chill** (*chuī*),
或强或羸，
either **strong** (*qiáng*) or **weak** (*léi*),
或载或隳，
either **bear** (*zài*) or **destroy** (*huī*).
是以圣人去甚，去奢，去泰。
Hence, the Sage avoids the **excessive** (*shèn*),
the **extravagant** (*shē*), and the **overbearing** (*tài*).

经曰：
The **Classic** says:
将欲取天下而为之者，
When one seeks to take the world and **acts** upon it,
吾见其不得已也。
I see that it is not inevitable.
天下神器，
The world is a **divine vessel**,
不可为也。
which cannot be **acted upon**.
为者必败之，
To **act** upon it is to **defeat** it,
执者必失之。
and to **grasp** it is to **lose** it.
凡在天下之物，
All things under heaven
或行或随，
either **move** or **follow**,
各有一时；
each has its **time** (*shí*).
或煦或吹，
either **warm** or **chill**,
各有一气；
each has its **qi** (*qì*).
或强或羸，
either **strong** or **weak**,
各有一势；
each has its **force** (*shì*).
或载或隳，
either **bear** or **destroy**,
各有一道。
each has its **Dao/Way**.
是以圣人去甚，去奢，去泰。
Hence, the Sage avoids the **excessive**, the **extravagant**, and the **overbearing**.

道曰：
The **Dao/Way** says:
取天下者，
Those who seek to take the world
常以无事，
should **do nothing** (*wúshì*).
及其有事，
But when they **act**,
不足以取天下。
it is insufficient to take the world.
古之得天下无为而治者，
The ancients who obtained the world through **non-action** (*wúwéi*) and **governance** (*zhì*)
真有为也。
were truly **acting** (*yǒuwéi*).
将欲取天下而为之，
When one seeks to take the world and **acts** upon it,
吾见其不得已，
I see that it is not inevitable.
故天下神器，
Thus, the world is a **divine vessel**,
不可妄为也，

执者失之。
and to **grasp** it is to **lose** it.

各有天时；
each has its **heavenly time**.
煦之吹之，
either **warm** or **chill**,
各有气数；
each has its **allotted qi** (*qìshù*).
强之羸之，
either **strong** or **weak**,
各有势力；
each has its **strength** (*shìlì*).
载之隳之，
either **bear** or **destroy**,
各有道理。
each has its **principles** (*dàolǐ*).
是以圣人去其甚，
Hence, the Sage avoids the **excessive**,
不使不得已，
so that it is not inevitable.
去其奢，
avoids the **extravagant**,
不使有败，
so that there is no **defeat**.
去其泰，
avoids the **overbearing**,
不使有失。
so that there is no **loss**.

德曰：
The **Virtue/Power** says:
天之有天下，
Heaven’s possession of the world
犹人之有身也。
is like a person’s possession of their **body** (*shēn*).
人身之事，
The affairs of a person’s **body**
亦有自然可取之时，
also have their **natural** (*zìrán*) times when they can be **taken**.
将欲取而为之者，
When one seeks to **take** and **acts** upon it,
吾见其不得已。
I see that it is not inevitable.
况天下人身，
Much more so for the world and the people’s **bodies**,
乃上天之神器，
which are the **divine vessels** of the **Highest Heaven** (*shàngtiān*).
断不可以为也。
they cannot be **acted upon** at all.
取而为者必败，
To **take** and **act** upon them is to **defeat** oneself,
执而取者必失之。
and to **grasp** and **take** them is to **lose** them.
凡人之为物，
All things in the world of people
行者随之以时，
either **move** or **follow** in their **time**,
煦者吹之以气，
either **warm** or **chill** with their **qi**,
强者赢之以势，
either **strong** or **weak** with their **force**,
载者隳之以理。
either **bear** or **destroy** with their **principles**.

Thus, the Sage removes excess, removes extravagance, removes arrogance—is this not because they have no selfishness? Therefore, they can fulfill their own ends.

**Chapter Thirty: Assisting the Sovereign with the Dao**
Those who assist the sovereign with the Dao do not use force of arms to compel the world; their actions return to them as they sow. Where the army encamps, brambles and thorns grow. After great armies march, there will surely be years of famine. Thus, the virtuous are resolute in the Dao alone, daring not to rely on force. Resolute yet unboastful, resolute yet unvaunting, resolute yet unarrogant, resolute yet without compulsion—this is to be resolute without relying on force. When things flourish, they grow old; this is called *not-Dao*. *Not-Dao* brings early ruin#1.

The Classic says: Those who assist the sovereign with the Dao do not use force of arms to take the world; their actions return to them as they sow. Where the army encamps, brambles and thorns grow. After great armies march, there will surely be years of famine. Thus, those skilled in assisting the sovereign are resolute in the Dao alone, daring not to rely on force. Resolute yet unvaunting, resolute yet unarrogant, resolute yet without compulsion—this is to be resolute without relying on force. Things flourish then grow old; this is called *not-Dao*. If one knows it is *not-Dao*, it is better to cease early.

The Dao says: Ministers and nobles assist the sovereign with the Dao, not using force of arms to compel the world. The sovereign assists Heaven and Earth with the Dao, not using violent governance to harm beings. The *Tai* hexagram speaks: "Heaven and Earth unite—*Tai*. The sovereign completes Heaven and Earth’s Dao, aids their natural order, and governs the people accordingly. Thus, those who hold the Dao gain much assistance; those who lose the Dao gain little. When assistance is at its peak, the world follows them; when it is at its lowest, even kin betray them. To attack where the world follows and where kin betray—thus, the virtuous may have no war, yet if they war, they must win, not relying on force.

If one relies on force of arms to compel the world, their actions will surely return to them as they sow. Where the army encamps, brambles and thorns grow. After great armies march, there will surely be years of famine. The Dao of Heaven returns as it sows. When the two *yang* lines are ascendant, reaching the eighth month, disaster is certain. Thus, those skilled in war are resolute in the Dao alone, daring not to rely on force of arms, for relying on force leads to defeat. If one attains resoluteness yet remains unboastful, unvaunting, unarrogant, and without compulsion—this is to be resolute without relying on force. Why? For things flourish then grow old; this is called *not-Dao*. If one knows it is *not-Dao*, it is better to cease early.

The *De* says: The sovereign is the heart. Those who govern the heart with the Dao hold tranquility and simplicity as supreme, daring not to use the weapons of victory to seize the world. The Great Yang flows with its flavor, longing to depart from humanity, so Heaven unleashes its killing intent, and dragons and serpents rise from the earth. When humanity unleashes its killing intent, Heaven and Earth reverse their course, and their actions will surely return to them as they sow. Heaven shakes, Earth trembles, mountains collapse, valleys split, trees fall, forests crumble, rivers dry, seas exhaust—is this not where the army encamps, brambles and thorns grow, and after great armies march, there will surely be years of famine? Truly terrifying! Thus, those skilled in war are resolute in the Dao alone. If one attains the Dao and does not cease, why would they dare to rely on force? Thus, they do not boast, do not vaunt, do not grow arrogant, yet endure as if compelled—this is to be resolute without relying on force. For when strength is used in humility, strength is preserved; if strength is used recklessly, it will meet ruin. It is said: things flourish yet do not cease, they grow old—this is called *not-Dao*. Knowing it is *not-Dao*, cease early.

**Chapter Thirty-One: The Fine Weapon**
The fine weapon is an ominous instrument; beings detest it, so those who hold the Dao do not dwell upon it. Thus, the virtuous in peace value the left, in war value the right. The weapon is an ominous instrument, not the instrument of the virtuous; it is used only when unavoidable, with tranquility and simplicity held supreme. To win yet not take pride in victory—if one takes pride, they delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot fulfill their ambitions in the world. Thus, auspicious matters are honored on the left, inauspicious on the right. The Assistant General stands left, not mastering killing; the Supreme General stands right, signifying a position of dominance, treated with funeral rites. Many are slain, and with sorrowful weeping—thus, even in victory, they are treated with funeral rites.

The Classic says: To call arms a fine weapon is to speak of an ominous instrument; beings detest it, so those who hold the Dao do not dwell upon it. Thus, the virtuous in peace value the left—life’s side—and in war value the right#2—death’s side. The weapon is an ominous instrument, not the instrument of the virtuous; it is used only when unavoidable, with tranquility and simplicity held supreme. Thus, to win yet not regard it as beautiful—if one regards it as beautiful, they will delight in it, and delighting in it is to delight in killing. Those who delight in killing, others will surely kill them; they cannot fulfill their ambitions in the world. Thus, auspicious matters are honored on the left, inauspicious on the right. The Assistant General stands left, not mastering killing. The Supreme General stands right, signifying a position of dominance, treated with funeral rites. Many are slain, and with sorrowful weeping—thus, even in victory, they are treated with funeral rites.

The Dao says: The army is the multitude. *Zhen* is rectitude. To govern the multitude with rectitude is to attain kingship. When firm yet yielding, moving through peril yet following the natural order—with this, one poisons the world, yet the people follow, bringing auspice. If the people do not follow, what disaster is there? Thus, even the fine weapon is an ominous instrument, much less relying on force! Beings detest it, so those who hold the Dao do not dwell upon it. Thus, the virtuous in peace value the left, for the Emperor emerges from *Zhen*—spring’s birth with benevolence—so auspicious matters are honored on the left. Thus, the Assistant General stands left, the fourth line of the *Shi* hexagram placing the army on the left, treated with auspicious rites. In war, the right is valued, for the *Wang* hexagram is linked to *Yi*—autumn’s killing with righteousness—so inauspicious matters are honored on the right.

Thus, the Supreme General stands on the right, signifying a position of dominance, and is treated with funeral rites. War is an ominous instrument, not the tool of the virtuous. When used unavoidably, one must hold to serenity, simplicity, and emptiness as supreme—thus, it is not glorified. If war is taken as a noble pursuit, it will surely become like Qin and Chu, delighting in slaughter. Those who delight in slaughter cannot prevail in the world; their fate belongs to the flames of Han.

Thus, though many victories are won, they are mourned with sorrowful tears. Hence, even repeated battles and repeated triumphs are treated with funeral rites.

**Virtue says:** Pure Yang declares: *"I have three swords to sever the desires of the world."* Purple Yang says: *"First, observe the Five Bandits of Heaven’s clarity; next, examine the Earth to settle the people. When the people are at ease and the nation is wealthy, then seek battle. Only after war’s end may one behold the Sage."* This is the finest of war’s instruments, yet still an ominous tool, which beings may detest. Thus, those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon it.

Therefore, the virtuous in peace honor the left, knowing to embrace the yielding while guarding the firm—nurturing the essence of wood. In war, they stand on the right, knowing to embrace the dark while guarding the bright—seeking the essence of metal. Taking must follow the Way; one does not seize by force. War is an ominous instrument, not the tool of the virtuous. If used unavoidably, serenity is supreme. Thus, war is not glorified; to glorify it is to wield a tool of slaughter. Those who delight in slaughter will meet ruin—how can they prevail in the world?

Hence, the Assistant General stands left, treated with auspicious rites, while the Supreme General stands right, treated with funeral rites. Those who love strife must know their enemy—how can one be too cautious?

**Chapter 32: The Dao Ever Nameless**
The Dao ever nameless,
Though its simplicity is small,
The world dares not submit to it.

If lords and kings can guard it,
All things will come as guests.

Heaven and Earth unite,
Descending sweet dew—
No one commands, yet all is balanced.

When names first arise,
Names already exist.

Knowing when to stop,
Stopping is how one avoids peril.

Compare the Dao in the world
To rivers and valleys flowing to the sea.

The Classic says:
*The Dao ever nameless,
Though its simplicity is small,
The world dares not submit to it.
If lords and kings can guard it,
All things will come as guests.*

Thus, Heaven and Earth unite,
Descending sweet dew—
No one commands, yet all is balanced.
When names first arise,
Things already named will know when to stop.
Knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril.

Compare the Dao in the world
To rivers and valleys flowing to the sea.

**The Dao says:**
The Dao ever nameless,
Is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
When names first arise,
It becomes the mother of all things.
Though its simplicity is small,
It is the constant of the Dao—
Who dares submit to it?

Thus, lords and kings who hold to it
Upright the world.
If they can guard it,
All things will come as guests.

Heaven and Earth unite,
Descending sweet dew—
Thus, the receptive rejoices,
Its form universally nourishing all things above,
Bringing the benefit of birth.
Who could attribute this to human effort?
Yet all is balanced.

When names first arise,
Names already exist—
One must know when to stop.
Knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril.

The Dao in the world—
Though the world is vast,
All return to the Dao.
Rivers and valleys to the sea—
Though many, all flow to the sea.
Lords and kings to all things—
Though diverse, all submit.

Those who name yet do not know when to stop—
Where shall they return?

**Virtue says:**
Its Dao is ever constant,
Originally nameless—
The One Qi before Heaven.
Though its form is small,
Who dares submit to it?

Lords and kings are the masters of the body—
If they guard this One Qi before Heaven,
Not deeming it small,
Then all affairs and things within the body submit.

Thus, Heaven and Earth interweave,
All things refine into purity,
Male and female merge their essence,
All things generate,
Gathering essence and spirit,
Descending sweet dew—
No one commands, yet all is balanced,
Returning to the infant state.

When names first arise,
Names already exist—
One must know when to stop.
To act is perilous—
Thus, it is said: *Knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril.*

All things return to the human body—
Like the world returning to the Dao,
Rivers and valleys to the sea—
Is it not vast?

**Chapter 33: Knowing Others is Wisdom**
Knowing others is wisdom;
Knowing oneself is enlightenment.
Overcoming others is strength;
Overcoming oneself is power.

Knowing contentment is wealth;
Persistent action is resolve.
Not losing one’s place ensures longevity;
Dying yet not perishing is true life.

The Classic says:
*Knowing others is wisdom;
Knowing oneself is enlightenment.
Overcoming others is strength;
Overcoming oneself is power.
Knowing contentment ensures lasting wealth;
Persistent action is resolve.
Dwelling without losing one’s place ensures endurance;
Dying yet leaving a name unvanquished is true life.*

**The Dao says:**
The Dao within the breast is like a mirror of water—
All forms arise and vanish without escaping its reflection.
Water governs wisdom; knowing others is wisdom.

The Sage’s Dao:
Conquering the self to restore propriety,
Knowing the constant to embrace the public—
Publicness generates enlightenment;
Knowing oneself is enlightenment.

Auspicious and inauspicious are determined by the steadfast victor.

As for the strong oppressing the weak,
The many assaulting the few—
Overcoming others is strength.

One day conquering the self to restore propriety,
The world returns to benevolence—
Overcoming oneself is power.

Wealth knows no greater than contentment;
Calamity knows no greater than ignorance of contentment.
Blame knows no greater than ignorance of stopping;
Peril knows no greater than ignorance of stopping.

Knowing contentment is wealth.
The virtuous persist without ceasing—they have resolve.
Dwelling in their place without shifting,
Not losing their place—
This is the constant of endurance.

The **Sixth Five** in *Yù*—auspicious and steadfast—
Though swift, its constancy endures;
Its core remains unlost.
Though lost, yet long-lived—
This is the Way of the unending.

**Virtue** speaks:
Know thyself, know thy foe,
A hundred battles, a hundred victories.
Know thy foe not, yet know thyself,
One victory, one defeat.
Know neither self nor foe,
A hundred battles, a hundred defeats.

The Way of nurturing life
Must root in yin and yang’s interplay,
Light and weight balanced—
Never erring.
First, know others;
Then, know thyself.
Without knowing, how can one discern?
If yin and yang are skewed,
How can deeds be wrought?

Conquering others lies not in brute force—
It has its own logic.
Conquering oneself lies not in brute force—
It has no logic at all.

Having a name, one must know when to stop;
Thus, the contented endure in wealth.

To persist without ceasing—
This is the resolve of the virtuous.
Advancing, retreating, waxing, waning,
Drawing, adding—
Using all without losing ground—
This is the unending Way.

Though fallen, yet no peril;
Though dead, yet not lost.
Sitting, life; standing, death—
Form and spirit both refined—
This is the unending longevity.

**Chapter Thirty-Four: The Great Dao Flows**

The Great Dao flows—
It cannot be confined to left or right.
All things rely on it to live,
Yet it claims no credit.
Its work is done without taking ownership,
Ever without desire—
This is called *small*.
All things return to it,
Yet it takes no ownership—
This is called *great*.
Thus, the Sage never claims greatness,
And so achieves greatness.

The Classic says:
The Great Dao flows—
It cannot be confined to left or right.
All things rely on it to live,
Yet it claims no credit.
Its work is done without taking ownership,
Ever without desire—
This is called *small*.
All things return to it,
Yet it takes no ownership—
This is called *great*.
Thus, the Sage never claims greatness,
And so achieves greatness.

The Dao speaks:
Observe all things through Heaven and Earth,
And Heaven and Earth are but Heaven and Earth.
Observe them through the Dao,
And Heaven and Earth are but all things.
Thus, the Great Dao flows—
All is beyond left or right.
All things rely on it to live,
Yet it claims no credit.
All things complete through it,
Yet it takes no ownership.
Its work is done without taking credit.
Ever without desire,
It can be rolled up yet never fills the hand—
This is called *small*.
All things return to it,
Yet it knows no master—
This is called *great*.
Thus, the Sage achieves greatness,
Yet never claims it,
And so achieves greatness.

Heaven and Earth set their places,
The Sage perfects their functions.
Human schemes, ghostly schemes—
The people’s power is their strength.

**Virtue** speaks:
The Great Ultimate, the Great Dao flows—
Circulating a million eighteen thousand *li*,
Encompassing Heaven and Earth’s sixty-four thousand *li*,
Ascending and descending within three thousand *li*.
Approaching, no sound is heard;
Following, no trace remains—
How can it be confined to left or right?
All things rely on it to live—
What claim does its Way make?
All things depend on it to complete—
What mastery does its Way hold?
Speaking of *qi*,
Its name is small;
Speaking of things,
Its kind is vast.
Thus, the Sage grasps Heaven and Earth’s Way,
Holds yin and yang’s *qi*,
Making one *yuan* a year,
One year a day,
One day a moment—
Seizing creation in an instant,
Achieving great deeds in a breath,
Then cleansing the heart, guarding the mind,
Retreating into seclusion—
Thus, the Sage achieves greatness.

**Chapter Thirty-Five: Grasping the Great Symbol**

Grasp the Great Symbol,
And all under Heaven will follow.
Following without harm,
Peace and ease prevail.
Offer joy and bait,
Even passing travelers will stay.
The Dao’s utterance is bland—
Tasteless, yet profound.
Gazed upon, not fully seen;
Listened to, not fully heard;
Used, never exhausted.

The Classic says:
The Symbol without form—
This is called the Great Symbol.
Grasp it, and all under Heaven follows—
What harm could there be?
Not just no harm—
Peace and ease prevail.
Offer joy and bait to the people,
Even passing travelers will stay.
The Dao’s utterance is bland—
Tasteless, yet profound.
Gazed upon, not fully seen;
Listened to, not fully heard;
Used, yet never fully exhausted.

The Dao speaks:
Mysterious and vague—
Yet within, a Symbol.
The Sage grasps it and acts,
And though all under Heaven follows,
No harm is done—
For it brings only peace and ease,
Establishing its ultimate.
Without bias or favor,
It follows the King’s righteousness;
Without artificial goodness,
It follows the King’s Way;
Without artificial evil,
It follows the King’s path.
Without bias or faction,
The King’s Way is vast;
Without faction or bias,
The King’s Way is level;
Without reversal or deviation,
The King’s Way is straight.
Gathering at its ultimate,
Returning to its ultimate—
Thus, offering joy and bait to the people,
Even passing travelers know to stop.
The Dao’s utterance is bland—
Not sweet on the edges or the center.
Gazed upon, not fully seen—
Not to be grasped by sight;
Listened to, not fully heard—
Not to be grasped by hearing.

The Sage takes the symbols of the thirteen *guà* (trigrams), exhaustively gathering and refining their uses,
To create perfect instruments for the benefit of all under Heaven—
The common people employ them daily without knowing their source,
Thus it is said: *"Their use cannot be fully exhausted."*

**Virtue/power** states: *"The Great Symbol*—the Dao/Way of the Primordial*—is the Sage’s guide.
When the Sage holds it and acts in the world,
No harm shall come—
Thus, those who grasp the Dao/Way
Are unharmed by blade or saw,
Nor scorched by water or fire—
What harm could they know?
For their spirit and form are at ease,
Their heart and *qì* (vitality) are balanced,
Their nature and life are in perfect harmony.

Therefore, with this Great Symbol,
The Sage offers joy and nourishment to all under Heaven—
Even those with grave transgressions
Turn back and know to cease.

Now why do they know to hold fast to the Great Symbol?
The Dao/Way of the Great Symbol
Speaks without taste,
Nourishes without taste—
Gazed upon, it is unseen;
Listened to, it is unheard—
Yet when put to use,
Its effects are wondrous beyond measure,
Inexhaustible in their power.

**When one seeks to contract**—*Chapter Thirty-Six*:
**When one seeks to contract,**
One must first expand.

**When one seeks to weaken**—
One must first strengthen;
When one seeks to discard,
One must first exalt;
When one seeks to take,
One must first give.

This is called *subtle clarity*.
The soft overcomes the hard,
The weak overcomes the strong.

Fish cannot escape the depths,
Nor can a state’s sharpest tools
Be shown to all.

The Classic says:
To stretch is to contract,
To strengthen is to weaken,
To exalt is to discard,
To take is to give.

If one would thus attain,
One must thus lose—
This is called *subtle yet clear*.

The soft overcomes the hard,
The weak overcomes the strong.
If fish are rigid and strong,
They cannot escape the yielding depths.

Thus, a state’s sharpest tools
Must not be displayed to all.

The Dao says:
Within, clarity and refinement,
Without, softness and compliance—
To endure great peril,
As did King Wen.

*Difficult virtue stands firm*—
Hiding its brilliance.

Within, turmoil yet steadfast resolve—
As did Ji Zi.

Thus, the moon, veiled, shines brighter,
The dawn, obscured, arrives clearer,
The sky, not cold, brings summer’s heat,
The earth, concealed, nurtures life—
The sovereign power of Heaven and Earth.

As for eastward labor and westward harvest,
A hundredfold gain for the people—
The people’s sovereign power.

With some, one may stand;
With others, one must yield—
The Sage treasures this deeply.

The soft overcomes the hard,
The weak overcomes the strong—
Like fish and dragons, they cannot escape the depths.
This is called *first subtle, then manifest*.

Thus, the depths of softness and weakness—
The treasures of river and sea—
Must not be revealed lightly,
For revelation brings peril.

Strengthening, exalting, giving, taking—
The state’s sharpest tools—
Must not be displayed to all,
For display brings danger.

If schemes are not kept secret,
Disaster will surely arise.

*Virtue says*:
Know the male yet cling to the female—
This is the valley of all under Heaven.
Know the white yet cling to the black—
This is the model for all under Heaven.

The Dao is a thief—
Three thefts are fitting.
*Virtue* is attainment—
One attainment is the measure.

In essence, cultivation is human effort.
Though called human effort,
Stillness rules the restless,
Yin and yang must align,
Fire and timing must be balanced.

What is weak, discarded, taken away—
If held within,
Then stillness awaits movement;
What is strong, exalted, given—
If in others,
Then movement follows stillness.

This is called *subtle yet manifest*.

All things arise from water and return to water.
Water is supremely soft and weak—
Yet fish and dragons cannot escape the depths.

Humans, at their most rigid and strong,
Cannot escape the *Heavenly One’s* water.

Thus, a state’s sharpest tools
Must not be displayed to all—
Lightly shown, they bring ruin.
A person’s greatest treasure
Must not be displayed to all—
Lightly shown, they invite censure.

This is the sovereign power of Heaven, Earth, and the Sage—
Not the rhetoric of *strategic maneuvering*.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao/Way of Constant Non-Action**

The Dao/Way constantly does nothing
Yet nothing remains undone.
If lords and kings could uphold it,
All things would transform of themselves.

When transformation stirs to act,
I will restrain it with the *Nameless Primordial*.
The *Nameless Primordial*
Will also refuse to act.

By not desiring, one attains stillness—
Then all under Heaven will align itself.

The Classic says:
The Dao/Way constantly does nothing
Yet nothing remains undone.
If lords and kings could uphold it,
All things would transform of themselves.

When transformation stirs to act,
And they do not know non-action,
I will restrain it with the *Nameless Primordial*.
The *Nameless Primordial*
Will also refuse to act.
By not desiring, one attains stillness—
Stillness, and all under Heaven will align itself.

The Dao says:
The Dao/Way is originally non-action,
Its root is non-desire.
Non-action and non-desire—
Yet nothing remains undone or undesired.

If lords and kings could uphold it,
All things would transform of themselves.

The Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun
Wore simple robes,
Yet all under Heaven was governed—
Governed through non-action.

What need for action?
Only reverence and rectitude in the southern face—
Thus it is said: *I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves.*

When transformation stirs to act,
Again, lest they lean toward action,
I will restrain it with the *Nameless Primordial*.

The Dao/Way is constant non-action—
The *Nameless Primordial* will also refuse to act.
To govern those who desire,
One must hold to stillness—
Stillness, and all under Heaven will align itself.

*Virtue says*:
The Dao/Way is constant non-action—
The pure, still body—
Yet nothing remains undone.

If lords and kings could uphold it with the Dao/Way,
All things would transform of themselves.

When transformation stirs to act,
I will restrain it with the *Nameless Primordial*—
The *Primordial Medicine of the Pre-Heaven*—
The *Primordial Primordial* is not what is desired.

Desiring yet not desiring—
Only by holding to stillness
Will the nature and life of all under Heaven align itself.

The Dao/Way constantly does nothing yet does—
This is true action.
Action through action
Cannot reach such subtlety.

*The Three Teachings of the Dao/Way and Virtue Classic, Volume Two, ends here.*

---
*The text of "不道" originally omitted two characters.*
*The use of arms favors the right—original text omitted "兵" (arms).*

**Volume Three of the *Three Teachings of the Dao/Way and Virtue Classic***
*Narrated by Deng Zui, the Jade Guest.*

**Chapter Thirty-Eight: *The Virtue/Power of the Highest Virtue/Power Does Not Virtue/Power***

The highest virtue/power does not virtue/power—
Thus it has virtue/power.
The lowly virtue/power does not lose virtue/power—
Thus it has no virtue/power.

The highest virtue/power acts without action yet nothing is left undone—
The lowly virtue/power acts with action yet nothing is fully accomplished.
The highest benevolence acts yet nothing is left undone—
Virtue/power responds to it.
The highest righteousness acts yet something is left undone—
Benevolence responds to it.
The highest propriety acts yet righteousness does not respond—
Then it rolls up its sleeves and seizes by the throat.

Thus, when the Dao/Way is lost, virtue/power arises;
When virtue/power is lost, benevolence arises;
When benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
When righteousness is lost, propriety arises.

For propriety is but the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust—
And the beginning of chaos.

Preceding knowledge is the superficial bloom of the Dao/Way—
And the start of folly.

Thus, the true man of virtue dwells in its depth, not its shallowness,
Resides in its substance, not its superficiality—
Hence he discards that and takes this.

The *Classic* states:
The highest virtue/power does not fear losing virtue/power—
Thus it has virtue/power.
The lowly virtue/power fears losing virtue/power—
Thus it has no virtue/power.
The highest virtue/power acts without action yet nothing is left undone—
The lowly virtue/power acts with action yet nothing is fully accomplished.
The highest benevolence acts yet nothing is left undone—
Virtue/power responds to it.
The highest righteousness acts yet something is left undone—
Benevolence responds to it.
The highest propriety acts yet righteousness does not respond—
How much less does it respond?
Then it rolls up its sleeves and seizes by the throat.

Thus, when the Dao/Way is lost, virtue/power arises;
When virtue/power is lost, benevolence arises;
When benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
When righteousness is lost, propriety arises.
When propriety is lost, it returns to chaos.

For propriety is but the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust—
And the beginning of chaos.
Preceding knowledge and prior awareness are the superficial bloom of the Dao/Way—
And the start of folly.
Thus, the true man of virtue dwells in the Dao/Way’s depth, not its superficial bloom,
Resides in virtue’s substance, not its superficial folly—
Hence he discards that and takes this.

The Dao/Way says:
The *Qian* (乾)—
The most robust of all under Heaven—
Its virtue/power and conduct are ever simple, yet it knows danger.
The *Kun* (坤)—
The most yielding of all under Heaven—
Its virtue/power and conduct are ever unadorned, yet it knows obstruction.

The *Upper Classic* (上经) speaks of the constant Dao/Way,
The constant name, the *Tai Ji* (太极),
And *Xu Ming* (虚明)—
These are the Dao/Way of the Pre-Heaven.
The *Lower Classic* (下经) speaks of the highest virtue/power,
Not virtue/powering, *Qian* and *Kun*,
And virtue/power’s conduct—
These are the Dao/Way of the Post-Heaven.

It is like the *Great Changes* (大易)—
Which also has an Upper and a Lower Classic.

The *Yellow River Master* (河上公) was not ordinary indeed?
Heaven and Earth do not possess virtue/power of their own—
Thus they possess virtue/power.
All things do not lose Heaven and Earth’s virtue/power—
Thus they lack virtue/power.

The highest virtue/power acts without action yet the four seasons proceed—
Without anything to be done, hence it is called *wu wei* (无为).
The lowly virtue/power acts with action yet all things are accomplished—
With something to be done, hence it is called *you wei* (有为).
Thus, Heaven, Earth, and all things are the virtue/power of the highest and lowly.

Man is but one of all things—
The most refined and precious of all things—
Thus he is paired with Heaven and Earth as the *Three Talents* (三才),
To oversee all things’ virtue/power of generation and growth.

The most refined and precious of men—
The sage—
Thus he governs the traces of order and chaos across ten thousand ages—
Hence, the highest benevolence acts yet nothing is left undone.

Heaven and Earth’s great virtue/power—
The highest and lowly respond to it—
Why must there be action?
To be reverent and occupy the southern seat is sufficient.

The age of Yao and Shun—
The highest righteousness acts yet something is left undone—
The sage takes the *One Qi* (一气) of the Pre-Heaven as his master.
The age of Tang and Wu—
Revolution in accordance with Heaven and response to humanity—
The age of Shang and Zhou—
The highest has the benevolence of Yao and Shun to respond to it.
The highest propriety acts yet righteousness does not respond—
How much less does it respond?
Then it rolls up its sleeves and seizes by the throat.

Thus, when the Dao/Way is lost, virtue/power arises;
When virtue/power is lost, benevolence arises;
When benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
When righteousness is lost, propriety arises.
When propriety is lost, it returns to chaos.

For propriety is but the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust—
And the beginning of chaos.
Preceding knowledge is the superficial bloom of the Dao/Way—
And the start of folly.
Thus, the true man of virtue dwells in the Dao/Way’s depth, not its superficial bloom,
Resides in virtue’s substance, not its superficial folly—
Hence he discards that and takes this.

The *Classic* states:
A fine merchant hides his wares as if he had none—
A man of great virtue/power, though his virtue/power is vast,
His bearing seems like that of a fool.
Having attained the Dao/Way of the Pre-Heaven,
He fulfills the virtue/power of the true man—
Clad in coarse hemp yet holding jade within—
He does not possess virtue/power of his own—
This is called the highest virtue/power.

The lowly virtue/power holds to virtue/power without losing it—
Comparing it to nature—
This is called lacking virtue/power.
The highest virtue/power acts without action yet nothing is left undone—
The Dao/Way of the Pre-Heaven’s *wu wei*.
The lowly virtue/power acts with action yet something is left undone—
The Dao/Way of the Post-Heaven’s daily practice.

The highest benevolence acts yet nothing is left undone—
It takes the *One Qi* of the Pre-Heaven as its master.
The highest righteousness acts yet something is left undone—
It follows the *Fire Candidate* of the *Zhou Tian* (周天) as its guest.
The highest propriety acts yet none respond—
Then it rolls up its sleeves and seizes by the throat—
The ignorant do not know constancy,
And recklessly act as tyrants.

Thus, when Heaven is lost, Earth arises;
When Earth is lost, humanity arises;
When humanity is lost, things arise;
When things are lost, chaos arises.

For propriety is but chaos—
The thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,
And the beginning of chaos.
Preceding knowledge is the superficial bloom of the Dao/Way—
And the start of folly.
Thus, the true man of virtue dwells in the Dao/Way’s depth, not its superficial bloom,
Resides in virtue’s substance, not its superficial folly—
Hence he discards that and takes this.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: *The Chapter of the Ancient Obtaining of the One***

Those who anciently obtained the One—
Heaven obtained the One and became clear,
Earth obtained the One and became settled,
The *shen* (神) obtained the One and became refined,
The *gu* (谷) obtained the One and became full,
All things obtained the One and were born,
And the feudal lords obtained the One to be the steadfast foundation of all under Heaven.

Their attainment of the One was the same—
Heaven, without the One’s clarity, would fear collapse,
Earth, without the One’s settledness, would fear eruption,
The *shen* (神), without the One’s refinement, would fear exhaustion,
The *gu* (谷), without the One’s fullness, would fear depletion,
All things, without the One’s birth, would fear annihilation,
And the feudal lords, without the One’s steadfast foundation, would fear decline—
Though they were high and noble.

Thus, the noble relies on the lowly as its root,
And the high relies on the lowly as its foundation.
Therefore, the feudal lords call themselves *"gū-guǎ-bùgǔ"*—
Is this not their way of taking the lowly as root?
Is it not so?

Hence, the Dao of the *shù* (数) is without carriage,
Not desiring to gleam like jade,
Nor to be coarse like stone.

The Classic says:

The Way of the ancient attainment of the One—
Thus, Heaven obtained the One to become clear,
Earth obtained the One to become settled,
The *shen* (神) obtained the One to become refined,
The *gu* (谷) obtained the One to become full,
All things obtained the One to be born,
And the feudal lords obtained the One to be the steadfast foundation of all under Heaven.

Their attainment of the Way was the same—
Heaven, without the One’s clarity, would fear collapse,
Earth, without the One’s settledness, would fear eruption,
The *shen* (神), without the One’s refinement, would fear exhaustion,
The *gu* (谷), without the One’s fullness, would fear depletion,
All things, without the One’s birth, would fear annihilation,
And the feudal lords, without the One’s steadfast foundation, would fear decline—
Though they were high and noble.

Thus, the noble relies on the lowly as its root,
And the high relies on the lowly as its foundation.
This is why the boundary of the feudal lords’ self-designation as *"gū-guǎ-bùgǔ"*
Is spoken of as the root of the lowly.
Is this not their way of taking the lowly as root?
Is it not so?

The **Dao** is singular in its essence—
Thus, the *Great Ultimate* is one circle of the Dao.

Therefore, the *Yì* (易) speaks of the *Great Ultimate* (太极),
Which gives birth to the *Two Principles* (兩儀),
The *Two Principles* generate the *Four Symbols* (四象),
The *Four Symbols* produce the *Eight Trigrams* (八卦),
The *Eight Trigrams* determine auspicious and inauspicious,
And auspicious and inauspicious give rise to great undertakings.

Heaven, Earth, the *shen* (神), the *gǔ* (谷), all things, and the feudal lords—
Their governance is one.
Heaven, without the One, would surely crack,
Earth, without the One, would surely erupt,
The *shen*, without the One, would surely falter,
The *gǔ*, without the One, would surely run dry,
All things, without the One to sustain their birth, would surely perish,
And the feudal lords, without the One to uphold their virtue and nobility, would surely decline.

Thus, the noble relies on the lowly as its root,
And the high relies on the lowly as its foundation.
This is why the feudal lords designate themselves as *"gū-guǎ-bùgǔ"* (孤寡不谷),
Taking the lowly as root—
Is this not so?
Is it not so?

Therefore, to focus on the use of many carriages,
Yet count their forms—
This is to have no carriages at all.

The polished brilliance of jade,
The rough solidity of stone—
The sage does not desire such fixed forms,
For the body is but a spoken term.

Thus, the sage values its use,
Not its form,
Resides in its substance,
Not its surface.

**Virtue** says: The One—
No thought, no action,
The divine and mysterious attainment of the One.

Therefore, the division from the Dao is called *ming* (命),
The manifestation of the One is called *xìng* (性),
The transformation through yin and yang, symbolized and expressed, is called *shēng* (生),
The exhaustion of change and the completion of number is called *sǐ* (死).

*Ming* is the primordial *qi* of Heaven,
Without which nothing exists.

Humans have six yang converging at one head—
Thus, *Kàn* (乾) is the head,
And Heaven attains the One with clarity.

Humans have five viscera gathered in one abdomen—
Thus, *Kūn* (坤) is the abdomen,
And Earth attains the One with settledness.

The heart is the sovereign of the *shen*—
All dharmas arise from it,
And the *shen* attains the One with refinement.

The *gǔ*’s *shen* does not die—
This is called the *Mysterious Mother* (玄牝),
And the *gǔ* attains the One with fullness.

Gold and sand enter the five viscera,
Dispersing like mist, like wind and rain,
Perfuming and nourishing to the four limbs,
Enhancing complexion and luster—
All things attain the One with birth.

Then, when achievements are complete and names are fulfilled,
The feudal lord aligns with Heaven and Earth in **virtue**,
With the sun and moon in luminosity,
With the four seasons in order,
And with the spirits and *shen* in auspicious and inauspicious—
This is how the feudal lord attains the One as the steadfast foundation of all under Heaven.

Thus, Heaven, without fear of cracking, endures clarity,
Earth, without fear of eruption, endures settledness,
The *shen*, without fear of exhaustion, endures refinement,
The *gǔ*, without fear of depletion, endures fullness,
All things, without fear of annihilation, endure birth,
And the feudal lords, without fear of decline, endure virtue—
Their attainment of the One is the same.

At first, the most humble things are taken as root,
And the sage is called noble.
At first, the most base things are taken as foundation,
And the high is aligned with Heaven.
Thus, the feudal lords designate themselves as *"gū-guǎ-bùgǔ"*—
Is this not their way of taking the lowly as root?
Is it not so?
Is it not so?

Therefore, to focus on carriages yet count their forms—
This is to have no carriages at all.
To focus on the Dao yet count its forms—
This is to have no Dao at all.

Thus, the sage does not desire
The polished brilliance of jade,
The rough solidity of stone—
But to conceal all uses.

The chapter of **Return** (反), the fourth movement of the Dao:
**Return** is the Dao’s dynamic motion,
**Weakness** is the Dao’s subtle use.

All things under Heaven are born from *yǒu* (有),
And *yǒu* arises from *wú* (無).

The Classic says:
**Return** and **Repetition** (復) are the Dao’s motion,
**Gentleness** and **Weakness** (柔弱) are the Dao’s use.

All things under Heaven,
From *wú* arise in *yǒu*,
And from *yǒu* return to *wú*—
The origin and the end, returning in cycles.

The Dao says:
**Repetition** (復), **Completion** (亨), **Firmness** (剛) returns.
Motion with harmony brings forth,
Thus, entering and exiting without haste,
Friends arriving without blame.

To return and repeat the Dao,
In seven days, it returns again.
The motion of Heaven—
Does it not reveal the heart of Heaven and Earth?

When the One Yang returns,
The sun aligns with Heaven’s order,
Heaven’s motion is primary—
**Return** is the Dao’s dynamic motion.

It faces firmness yet remains gentle,
And in the midst of firmness, it responds.
Great **Completion** with rectitude—
This is the Dao of Heaven.

Until the eighth month, when there is inauspiciousness,
And the decline is not long.

When the Two Yangs reach **Facing** (臨),
The moon aligns with Earth’s order,
Earth’s nature is still—
**Weakness** is the Dao’s subtle use.

**Small Completion** (泰) goes from small to great,
And **Completion** (亨) brings auspiciousness—
This is when Heaven and Earth interact,
And all things are in harmony.
Above and below interact,
And their intentions are unified.

Within, the yang; without, the yin,
Within, vigor; without, compliance,
Within, the *junzi* (君子); without, the *xiǎorén* (小人)—
The *junzi*’s Dao endures,
The *xiǎorén*’s Dao declines.

When the Three Yangs unite in **Small Completion**,
Things align with human order,
The ruler is born—
All things under Heaven are born from *yǒu*.

Until the tenth month, when *Kūn* (坤) conceals it,
And from *yǒu* arises *wú*—
Returning to the origin and the end.

**Virtue** says:
**Shedding** (剥) is when One Yang is above,
**Return** is when One Yang is below,
**Decisive** (夬) is when One Yin is above,
**Meeting** (姤) is when One Yin is below—
*Kàn* and *Kūn* come and go,
The gate of **Closure** and **Opening** (阖辟).

*Kǎn* (坎) is the moon’s water,
And **Return** is the **Middle Male** (中男).
*Lí* (離) is the sun’s fire,
And **Return** is the **Middle Female** (中女).

The *Zǐyáng* (紫陽) says:
The sun dwells in the *Lí* position,
Yet **Return** makes it female;
*Kǎn* is paired with the *Chán* (蟾) palace,
And thus it is male—
If one does not grasp this inverted meaning,
Do not presume to speak of the Dao’s profound truths.

Again it says:
If one seeks to reverse the use of the sun,
The very dust of the earth becomes treasure.

Thus, it is said: **Return** is the Dao’s dynamic motion.

*Bì* (畢) becomes the crow,
*Fáng* (房) becomes the rabbit—
*Lí* and *Kǎn* mutually serve as their foundation.

The **Supreme Virtue** is like water,
Water benefits all things yet does not contend—
Thus, it is said: **Weakness** is the Dao’s subtle use.

All things under Heaven arise from *wú* within *yǒu*,
Thus, it is said: *yǒu* arises from *wú*;
And from *yǒu* arises *wú*—
Thus, it is said: *wú* arises from *yǒu*.
The interplay of *yǒu* and *wú*,
The interplay of difficulty and ease—
And thus all things are **Completed** (既濟).

The chapter of the **Noble Ones Hearing the Dao** (上士聞道):
The **Noble One** hears the Dao,
And diligently practices it;
The **Middle One** hears the Dao,
And holds it with uncertain resolve;
The **Lowly One** hears the Dao,
And laughs at it—
If they do not laugh, it is not the Dao.

There are words to establish this.

The **Dao** is manifest yet seems obscure,
Advancing yet appears to retreat,
Smooth yet aligns with the common,
**Supreme Virtue** like a valley,
Great brightness like a stain,
Ample virtue like insufficiency,
Established virtue like theft,
True substance like corruption—
The **Great Square** has no corners,
The **Great Vessel** matures late,
The **Great Sound** is faint in voice,
The **Great Image** has no form,
The **Dao** is hidden, nameless.

Only the **Dao**—
**Good at lending** yet self-complete.

The **Scripture** says:
The **Noble One** hears the **Dao**,
And moves to act upon it;
The **Middle One** hears the **Dao**,
And holds it as if present, as if absent;
The **Lowly One** hears the **Dao**,
And laughs at it—
If they do not laugh, it is not the **Dao**.

*"Establishing"* means *"ultimate"*—
Thus, the **Ultimate Words** say:
The **Dao** is manifest yet seems obscure,
As when **Heaven** creates the **Grass-Mist**;
Advancing yet appears to retreat,
As **Thunder** and **Wind** wax and wane;
Smooth yet aligns with the common,
For things gather by their kind;
**Supreme Virtue** like a valley,
As **Habit** fills the **Abyss** yet does not overflow;
Great brightness like a stain,
For **Use** is hidden yet illuminates;
Ample virtue like insufficiency,
As **Earth’s Way** transforms fullness into flowing humility;
Established virtue like theft,
As **Heaven’s Way** diminishes fullness to nurture humility;
True substance like corruption,
For **Heaven’s Way** is ever-changing;
The **Great Square** has no corners,
As **Heaven** enfolds **Earth**;
The **Great Vessel** matures late,
As **Thunder** and **Joy** unite in the **Younger Sister**—
The great purpose of **Heaven** and **Earth**;
The **Great Sound** is faint in voice,
For **Thunder**, **Wind**, **Water**, and **Fire**
Do not clash yet converge,
Do not repel yet reach one another;
The **Great Image** has no form,
For **Sun**, **Moon**, and stars dwell in **Heaven** yet lack true shape;
The **Dao** is hidden, nameless,
Vague and profound, in things yet without fixed name.

Only this **Dao**—
**Good at lending**, yet self-complete,
As it pushes and borrows with all things,
And thus completes itself as **Heaven** and **Earth**.

**Virtue** says:
The ancient **Immortal** spoke:
*"A man does not reach the ninth generation before hearing the **Dao**.*
The **Noble One**—a man of the ninth generation—
Thus hears the **Dao** and diligently acts upon it.
The **Sage** said:
*The Middle Man and above can be spoken to of the **High**.*
The **Middle One**—a man of the world—
Thus hears the **Dao** as if present, as if absent.
The **Sage** said:
*He can be raised or lowered.*
The **Lowly One**—a man of one or two generations—
Thus hears the **Dao** and laughs at it.
The **Sage** said:
*The Middle Man and below cannot be spoken to of the **High**.*
If they do not laugh, it is not the **Dao**—
This is the direct account of its truth.

The **Dao**—
The **Heavenly** and **Earthly** **Yin** and **Yang**’s most genuine **qi**.
Even the **stupid** and **moving**, the **containing life**,
All possess this nature—
How much more so in man?
The **Heavenly** and **Earthly** **Yin** and **Yang**’s most genuine **qi**—
**Heaven** and **Earth** blend the **raw** and **cooked**,
All things refine into purity,
Male and female intermingle their **essence**,
All things are born.

The **Pure Yang** says:
*"Reflecting on where parents gave birth to me,
I clap my hands and teach people to laugh—*
This is what it means."

Thus it is said:
*The most profound mysteries of the world*
Cannot be despised.
Yet at the moment when **Yin** and **Yang** **qi** respond,
If in harmony, they form man;
If inverted, they serve the **Elixir**—
Thus it is said: *"The **Changing** is contrary to numbers."*

If in harmony, they form man—
Ten months, the fetus completes, nurturing the elder brother;
If inverted, they serve the **Elixir**—
Ten months, the fetus completes, entering the **Sage’s** mechanism.
The **Lowly One** laughs at this—
He who does not know laughter
First laughs at his parents,
Then at himself,
Then leaves laughter to his descendants—
And yet, what does he laugh at?

The **Mysterious Female Gate**—
This is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth**—
Thus it is said: *If they do not laugh, it is not the **Dao**.*

Thus the **Establishing Words** say:
The **Dao** is manifest yet seems obscure—
Hidden in its **Use**;
Smooth yet aligns with the common—
Revealed in **Ren**;
Advancing yet appears to retreat—
**Softness** overcomes **Hardness**;
**Supreme Virtue** like a valley—
**Weakness** overcomes **Strength**;
Great brightness like a stain—
Knowing **Honor**, guarding **Humiliation**;
Ample virtue like insufficiency—
Embracing **Primordial Oneness**, guarding **Unity**;
Established virtue like theft—
Great completion like deficiency—
Its **Use** is inexhaustible;
True substance like corruption—
Great fullness like emptiness—
Its **Use** is unfailing;
The **Great Square** has no corners—
Things blend into unity;
The **Great Vessel** matures late—
Late attainment brings great advantage;
The **Great Sound** is faint in voice—
The **Dragon’s** roar, the **Tiger’s** howl;
The **Great Image** has no form—
In harmony with the **Dao’s** truth;
The **Dao** is hidden, nameless—
Divine and mysterious, reaching ultimate oneness.

Only the **Dao**—
**Good at lending**, yet self-complete.

Dividing **Yin** and **Yang**,
Alternating **Soft** and **Hard**,
Thus the **Changing** forms its six positions to complete its chapter,
And **Time** rides the six **Dragons** to govern **Heaven**.
The **Way of Heaven** transforms and changes,
Each rectifying its **Nature** and **Life**.
Great indeed are these words!

**Chapter Forty-Two: The Dao Generates One**
The **Dao** generates **One**,
**One** generates **Two**,
**Two** generates **Three**,
**Three** generates all things.
All things bear **Yin** while embracing **Yang**,
Their **Qi** mingles to form **Harmony**.

What men detest
Are the **Orphan**, the **Widow**, the **Childless**—
Yet **Kings** and **Dukes** take them as titles.
Thus, some things are diminished yet gain,
Gain yet are diminished.

「。Great indeed are these words!

**Chapter Forty-Two: The Dao Generates One (Continued)**
The **Dao** that men are taught,
Is also my righteous teaching.
The **strong and arrogant** meet no good end.
I shall take them as my teaching father.

The *Classic* says:
The **Dao** generates **One**,
**One** generates **Two**,
**Two** generates **Three**,
**Three** generates all things.
All things bear **Yin** while embracing **Yang**,
Their **Qi** mingles to form **Harmony**—this is man.
What men detest
Are the **Orphan**, the **Widow**, the **Childless**—
Yet **Kings** and **Dukes** take them as titles,
This is the **lowly**.
Thus, some things are diminished yet gain,
**Humility brings benefit**.
Gain yet are diminished,
**Pride invites ruin**.
The **Dao** that men are taught,
Is also my righteous teaching.
Therefore, the **strong and arrogant** meet no good end,
And I shall take them as my teaching father,
Yet uphold **Softness** and **Weakness** as the **Master**.

The **Dao** says:
The **Dao** is the **Great Ultimate**’s single cycle,
Entering and exiting, moving and still.
The **Dao** generates **One**—
**Heaven** and **Earth**, the two **Polarities**, each receive **One** as **Odd** and **Even**.
**One** generates **Two**—the **Four Symbols**.
**Two** generates **Three**—the **Eight Trigrams**.
The **Three Lines** of the **Primordial Heaven**, these are the **true numbers** of the *Classic*.
**Three** generates all things—
**Hard** and **Soft** intermingle,
The **Eight Trigrams** clash and sway,
Transforming into **Sixty-Four Hexagrams**.
Thus, all things bear **Yin** while embracing **Yang**,
**Heaven** and **Earth** mingle their **Qi** to form man,
And **Harmony** is achieved among all things to fulfill the **Three Talents**’ **Dao**,
Making man the **Master** of all things.
What men detest
Are only the **Orphan**, the **Widow**, the **Childless**—
Because they are **lowly** and **humble**, men despise them.
Yet **Kings** and **Dukes** take them as noble titles,
**Humility** brings **honor**, and the **lowly** are **unassailable**.
Thus, what is diminished yet gains,
Is **nobility** rooted in **humility**,
**Elevation** founded on **lowliness**.
What gains yet is diminished,
Is like the sun at noon descending,
The moon at full waning.
The **Dao** that men are taught,
Is also my righteous teaching—
Yet they cannot make what is diminished gain,
Only long make what gains diminish.
Thus, for learning, it is daily gain,
For the **Dao**, it is daily loss.
Therefore, the **Soft** and **Weak** endure and thrive,
Diminished yet gain,
While the **Strong** and **Arrogant** perish,
Gained yet are diminished.
Hence I say, I shall take them as my teaching father,
For they **do not overstep the measure**.
**Virtue** says:
The **Dao** originates from **Emptiness** and **Non-being**,
From **Non-being** arises **Being**—thus it is called **One**.
Where the **Five Phases** do not reach,
Before **Parents** were born,
Where is man?
The **Dao** originates from **Emptiness** and **Non-being**.
**One** responds to **One**,
Between them arises form—
Thus the **Dao** generates **One**.
The **Former Master** has said:
Seizing **Emptiness**’s single point of **Truth**,
Eternal through ages, never decaying—
Mastering **One**, all matters conclude,
Thus **One** generates **Two**.
**Two** is **Qi**—
**Two** generates **Three**.
**Three** is **Nature**—
**Three** combine to form **One**,
Then all things may be generated,
Bearing **Yin** and embracing **Yang**,
None can resist.
The mingling **Qi** to form **Harmony**,
Is the **Fire**’s **Mastery** within man.
If man’s **Fire** **Mastery** is like the **Orphan**, the **Widow**, the **Childless**,
It is most detested by men—
Thus the **lowly scholar** hears the **Dao** and laughs greatly,
While **Kings** and **Dukes** take it as a noble title—
Why is this?
**Nobility** rooted in **humility**,
**Elevation** founded on **lowliness**.
Things in the world that are diminished yet gain,
Are those that, when one seeks to **pluck** them,
Must first be **stretched** taut.
Things that gain yet are diminished,
Are those that, before they are **taken**,
First give themselves away.
Now, the **Dao** that men are taught,
Is also my righteous teaching—
Yet none can follow me in turning **inversion** into **rectitude**,
Or **disorder** into **order**.
Alas!
The **Strong** and **Arrogant** meet no good end,
For they take **rectitude** as **inversion**,
And **order** as **disorder**.
Hence I say, I shall take them as my teaching father,
This is not **false**!

**Chapter Forty-Three: The Ultimate Softness of the World**
The **ultimate Softness** of the world,
Rides and roams the **ultimate Firmness** of the world,
With none able to enter the **Gapless**—
Thus I know the **benefit of Non-action**.

The **teaching of Non-speech**,
The **benefit of Non-action**,
Few in the world can attain.

The *Classic* says:
The **ultimate Softness** of the world,
Rides and roams the **ultimate Firmness** of the world,
With none able to enter the **Gapless**—
Thus I know the **benefit of Non-action**.
Now, the **teaching of Non-speech**,
The **benefit of Non-action**,
Few in the world can attain.

The **Dao** says:
**Water**, the **ultimate Softness** of the world,
Goes nowhere without **nourishing**.
In terms of **Qi**, **Water** is the **ultimate Firmness** of the world—
**Qi** rides and roams in **Water**, thus **Qi** within **Water** must **clarify**.
**Grass**; the **ultimate Softness** of the world,
Goes nowhere without **yielding**.
In terms of **Wind**, **Grass** is the **ultimate Firmness** of the world—
**Wind** rides and roams in **Grass**, thus **Wind** upon **Grass** must **subside**.
**Wind** is **Qi** with **sound**,
**Qi** is **Wind** without **sound**.
**Water** is **Qi** with **form**,
**Grass** is **Wind** with **form**.
Thus it is said, none can enter the **Gapless**.
**Clouds** follow **Dragons**,
**Winds** follow **Tigers**—
When the **Sage** acts, all things see,
Then each follows its **kind**—
Thus I know the **benefit of Non-action**.
What does **Heaven** speak of?
The **Four Seasons** follow their **Dao**,
The **Sage** reveres himself and faces south—
This is the **teaching of Non-speech**.
**Earth** follows and submits to **Heaven**,
All things grow from it—
The **Sage** wears simple robes,
And the world is governed—
This is the **benefit of Non-action**.
Thus, few in the world can attain it.

**Virtue** says:
With **Softness** overcoming **Hardness**,
With **Weakness** overcoming **Strength**,
How much more so when **Softness** and **Weakness** prevail,
Yet they ride and roam the **ultimate Firmness** of the world!
Knowing the **Male** yet holding to the **Female**,
Knowing the **White** yet holding to the **Black**,
This is **restraint** in **riding and roaming**.
**Yin** above, **Yang** below,
**Yang** flees beneath,
**Head** and **Tail** are **Martial**,
**Midsection** is **Cultural**—
This is **victory** in **riding and roaming**.
Advancing **Fire**’s **Mastery** is like **fighting** on **dangerous ground**—
This is **contention** in **riding and roaming**.
Thus, a nation’s **precious instruments**,
Cannot be displayed to the people—
To display them is to invite **calamity**,
To appear as having yet be **void**,
Naturally entering the **Gapless**.»

**Chapter Forty-Four: The Chapter on Name and Body**

What is called **"Strong"** yet does not meet its end,
What is called **"None"** yet does not alter its nature—
Having yet being void, void yet having,
Who understands this **Dao**?

Without the **Dao** yet acting brings loss,
With the **Dao** yet non-acting brings benefit—
Thus I know the benefit of **non-action**.

Motion and stillness unceasing,
Flesh and sinew as one,
Essence refined and firm,
Spirit and **qi** unchanging—
This is the teaching of **non-speech**.

Morning **accumulation**, evening **obscurity**,
Noon **union**, then **return**—
Heaven’s natural **water** and **fire**,
Circulating through the **Six Voids**,
The benefit of **non-action**.

To attain this is rare in the world—
Truly, these words are so.

Which is more intimate: **Name** or **Body**?
Which is more abundant: **Body** or **Wealth**?
Which brings greater harm: **Gain** or **Loss**?

Thus, to love excessively is to incur great expense,
To hoard excessively is to suffer great loss.
Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace,
Knowing cessation brings no peril—
Thus one may endure long.

The **Classic** says:
Which is more intimate: **Name** or **Body**?
Which is more abundant: **Body** or **Wealth**?
Which brings greater harm: **Gain** or **Loss**?

Thus, to love excessively is to incur great expense,
To hoard excessively is to suffer great loss.
Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace,
Knowing cessation brings no peril—
Thus one may endure long.

The **Dao** says:
To bestow the world yet not feel light,
As though it had never been yours—
To receive the world yet not feel heavy,
As though it had always been yours.
To have it as though you never had it,
To lack it as though you never lacked it—
If you cling to having or lacking,
Even to give a single hair would stir greedy, vulgar thoughts—
How much more so with the world?

Only the **Five Emperors** could know
That the world’s world is not their own.
Thus **Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang** all passed on Heaven’s **cycles**,
Lightly discarding the world as though casting off worn shoes—
Hence, **Body** is more intimate than **Name**.

The wealth of **Lütai**,
The grain of **Jùqiáo**—
Though much, in a day, the soldiers turn and rebel,
Blood flows to soak the pestles—
All becomes another’s possession.
Thus it is said: Which is more abundant, **Body** or **Wealth**?
Which brings greater harm, **Gain** or **Loss**?

Thus, to love excessively is to incur great expense,
To hoard excessively is to suffer great loss—
Their consequences return swiftly.

Knowing sufficiency is constant sufficiency—
Thus there is no disgrace.
Knowing cessation is constant cessation—
Thus there is no peril.
No greater calamity exists than not knowing cessation.
Knowing sufficiency, knowing cessation—
Thus one may endure long and unceasingly.

**Virtue** says:
**Name** is **Position**.
**Body** is **Guard**.
To hold **Position** yet not lose **Guard** is **Superior Wisdom**.
To lose **Guard** yet not attain **Position** is **Great Folly**—
An unchanging principle.

The **Dao** of men and women, husband and wife—
**Name** is **Position**.
The **Dao** of Heaven and Earth, male and female—
**Body** is **Guard**.

When male and female unite in **precision**,
All things transform and are born—
This is losing **Guard** yet not attaining **Position**.

When Heaven and Earth blend in **harmony**,
All things refine into **purity**—
This is attaining **Position** yet not losing **Guard**.

When husband and wife align, they beget mortals—
**False Man**.
When Heaven and Earth invert, they produce **Elixir**—
**True Man**.

**False Man** perishes in husband and wife,
**True Man** endures through Heaven and Earth—
Which is more intimate: **Name** or **Body**?

Within the **Body**, the **Medicine**—
Three hundred eighty-four **liǎng**,
One **liǎng** can suffice—
Common **mercury**, one **jīn**,
Yellow or white, yet the **liǎng** is unharmed,
Yellow and white grow ever more.
Yet abandon your **Spiritual Tortoise**,
Gaze upon my **Jawbone**—
This **Dao** is perilous.
Which is more abundant: **Body** or **Wealth**?

To take **alcohol** as **soup**,
To indulge in **folly** as custom,
To exhaust **essence** with desire,
To dissipate **True Qi**—
Some use **metals, stones, herbs, and woods** to supplement it,
Others swallow and grasp to aid it,
Regretting death’s delay—
Which brings greater harm: **Gain** or **Loss**?

Thus, those who love **Name** excessively
Will incur great expense in **Body**,
Those who hoard **Wealth** excessively
Will suffer great loss in **Life**.
Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace—
**Achievement** followed by **retreat**.
Knowing cessation brings no peril—
**Timely cessation** is cessation itself.
Thus one may endure long and unceasingly.

**Chapter Forty-Five: The Chapter on Great Achievement as Deficiency**

Great **achievement** appears as **deficiency**—
Its use is unexhausted.

Great **fullness** seems **empty**—
Its use is inexhaustible.

Great **straightness** bends,
Great **skill** appears clumsy,
Great **eloquence** stumbles—
**Haste** overcomes **cold**,
**Stillness** overcomes **heat**,
**Purity and stillness** are the **norm** for the world.

The **Classic** says:
Great **achievement** appears as **deficiency**—
Its use is unexhausted.
Great **fullness** seems **empty**—
Its use is inexhaustible.
Thus, great **straightness** bends,
Great **skill** appears clumsy,
Great **eloquence** stumbles—
Meaning **haste** overcomes **cold**,
**Stillness** overcomes **heat**,
**Purity and stillness** are the **norm** for the world.

The **Dao** says:
The **Heavenly Cycle** completes **365¼ degrees** yet does not reach six—
Vigorous yet unceasing;
The **Earth’s** square expanse, a thousand **li**—
Nine yet not ten—
Life-giving yet unexhausted—
Great **achievement** appears as **deficiency**,
Its use is unexhausted.

Heaven’s **sphere**, a hundred eighty thousand **li**,
Earth’s **four quarters**, sixty-four thousand **li**,
The **fixed paths** of sun and moon, fifty-four thousand **li**,
The **Heaven above Earth**, eight thousand four hundred **li**—
Heaven covers without favor,
Earth bears without favor,
Sun and moon shine without favor,
All things ascend to the **Void City**,
Hide in the **Embrace-Bag**—
When exhausted, they transform;
When transformed, they circulate;
When circulating, they endure—
Great **fullness** seems **empty**,
Its use is inexhaustible.

**Qian (Heaven)**—
In stillness, it is **concentrated**,
In motion, it is **straight**—
If **Qian** is not straight, it lacks **angles**.
If **Kun (Earth)** lacks **angles**, it lacks **squares**—
Thus, great **straightness** bends—
Hence, **bending** and **trust** respond, giving rise to **benefit**.
**Kān (Water)**, master of **wisdom**, generates **wood** in **Zhèn (Thunder)**—
Roots, sprouts, flowers, fruit—
None are unclean or disordered—
Water benefits all things yet does not contend—
Thus, great **skill** appears clumsy.

The **Way** unfolds without governance, yet the four seasons march in order,
Great eloquence seems slow of speech—
The **virtuous person** desires to be slow in words yet swift in deeds.

Agitation overcomes cold,
Stillness overcomes heat—
This is the inevitable **principle**.

Thus, the **Sage** ever preserves the **Dao** of **clearing and stillness**,
Taking it as the **rectification** for all under heaven.

**Virtue** speaks:
The body gathers its **great completion**,
Daring not to be full—
Circulating through the **Six Jia**, meeting the **Fighter**,
Upper crescent lacks gold—its use is not exhausted,
Lower crescent lacks silver—its use is not renewed.

**Great surging, great fullness**—
Sun and moon face heaven and earth—**Qian**.
**Unworn, unexhausted**—
Sun and moon meet in heaven and earth—**Kun**.

**Great straightness** bends—
The inchworm’s bending seeks **trust**.
**Great skill** seems clumsy—
Creation nurtures all things, yet clings to **Oneness**.
**Great eloquence** seems slow—
Transcending past and present, daring not to speak.

Agitation overcomes cold—**Fire and Water** yet unfulfilled.
Stillness overcomes heat—**Water and Fire** fulfilled.
**Clearing and stillness** are the **rectification** for all under heaven,
Form and spirit both refined—harmonizing with **True Dao**.

**Chapter 46: The World in Harmony**
When the **Way** prevails, warhorses are turned to plow.
When the **Way** decays, warhorses breed in the suburbs.
No guilt is greater than **desire**,
No calamity greater than **not knowing contentment**,
No blame greater than **grasping what is desired**.

Thus, **knowing contentment** is **constant contentment**.

The **Classic** says:
When the **Way** prevails, warhorses are turned to plow the fields.
When the **Way** decays, warhorses breed in the suburbs.
Seeing what is desirable yet taking it—no guilt is greater.
Seeing sufficiency yet not knowing it—no calamity is greater.
Taking what is desirable—no blame is greater.
Thus, **knowing contentment** is **constant contentment**.

The **Way** says:
**Tang and Wu** revolutionized, conforming to **Heaven** and responding to **humanity**,
When the world was at great peace, horses were returned to the southern slopes of **Hua Mountain**,
Cattle were released into the **Peach Grove** wilds—
Warhorses turned to plow.

In the **Spring and Autumn** era, the **Way** decayed,
Rites, music, and conquests issued from the feudal lords,
The **Four Barbarians** invaded the **Central States**,
Warhorses bred in the suburbs.

The **Five Hegemons** feigned **benevolence** through force—
No guilt greater than **desire**.
A finger in a boat can be grasped—
No calamity greater than **not knowing contentment**.
Borrowing the **Way** from **Yu** to attack **Guo**—
No blame greater than **grasping what is desired**.
Thus it is said: **knowing contentment** is **constant contentment**.

**Virtue** says:
When the **Way** prevails, the body completes its affairs.
**Qian-yang** as horse—vigorous yet unceasing.
True lead, true mercury refined into **pure yang**,
Embrace **Oneness**, guard **Unity**, solidify the foundation—
When the **Way** prevails, warhorses are turned to plow.
Where the master lingers, brambles grow—
After great armies, famine follows—
When the **Way** decays, warhorses breed in the suburbs.

If one sees what is desirable, the mind is disordered—
No guilt is greater.
**Knowing contentment** brings no disgrace,
**Knowing restraint** brings no peril—
Not knowing restraint—no calamity is greater.
**Purple Yang** says:
If not through accumulated **virtue** and cultivated **hidden merit**,
Every action invites **demons** to obstruct.
Seeing the **True Medicine** yet desiring it—
No blame is greater.
Thus it is said: **knowing contentment** is **constant contentment**.

**Chapter 47: Not Leaving the Door**
Not leaving the door, yet knowing all under heaven;
Not peering through the window, yet seeing **Heaven’s Way**.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.
Thus, the **Sage** knows without traveling, names without seeing, accomplishes without doing.

The **Classic** says:
Not leaving the door, yet knowing all under heaven;
Not peering through the window, yet seeing **Heaven’s Way**.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.
Thus, the **Sage** knows without further travel,
Names without needing to see,
Accomplishes without action.

The **Way** says:
The **Sage** exhausts **principle**, fulfills **nature**, reaching even **fate**—
What ears and eyes cannot perceive, by **principle** it is deduced,
Thus, a thousand-year calendar may be achieved while seated.
The more the mind strays, the less it knows.
Mastering **Oneness**, all affairs are complete.
Thus, the **Sage** shuts the **Four Gates**, opens the **Four Eyes**, penetrates the **Four Hearings**,
Taking all under heaven’s **knowing** as **knowing**, yet not acting,
Taking all under heaven’s **name** as **name**, yet not revealing,
Taking all under heaven’s **accomplishment** as **accomplishment**, yet not doing.

**Virtue** says:
Sitting is **establishment**, standing is **extinction**—
How could one leave the door if unaware of all under heaven?
Entering and exiting unobstructed—
How could one peer through the window if unaware of **Heaven’s Way**?
Thus, **virtue’s** perfection is **round** and **spiritual**—
The **spirit** knows no bounds—
The farther it goes, the nearer it returns.
**Knowledge** of **knowledge**—
The less it knows, the more it grasps.
Thus, the **Sage** gazes upward and downward,
Knows without traveling, names without seeing.
Before plows and boats, taking from the **thirteen trigrams’** symbols,
Accomplishes without doing.

**Master Kang** says:
Ears and eyes bright—yet the body remains poor.
The **Great Balance** has not fully bestowed.
Must explore the **Moon’s Cavern** to know things,
Before ascending the **Heavenly Root** to recognize **humanity**.
When **Qian** meets **Xun**, observe the **Moon’s Cavern**,
When **Earth** encounters **Xiao**, see the **Heavenly Root**.
Between the **Heavenly Root** and **Moon’s Cavern**, freely roam—
Thirty-six palaces, all spring.

Again:
The **Heavenly Heart** returns to **Non-heart**,
The **heart** seeks it in vain at all times.
If one says **Non-heart** means **no affairs**,
Why does **gold** arise from **water**?

Again:
Fleeing to **Wu** and **Yue** to seek the **Azure Sky**,
Yet unaware—**Heaven** is before one’s eyes.
**Master Yao**’s **knowing** still did not require leaving the door or peering through the window—
How much more so for the **Sage**?

**Chapter 48: Daily Learning**
Daily learning increases,
Daily **Dao** decreases.
Decrease it again, decrease it again,
Until **non-action**—
**Non-action**, yet nothing remains undone.

Thus, to take the realm,
One must act with **non-action**—
Yet when action arises,
It proves insufficient to take the realm.

The **Classics** say:
*"To learn is to daily increase,
To cultivate the **Dao** is to daily decrease.
Decrease again, decrease again,
Until **non-action**—
**Non-action**, yet nothing remains undone."*

Those who can take the realm
Must act with **non-action**—
Yet when action arises,
It proves insufficient to take the realm.

The **Dao** says:
*"Daily know what you lack,
Monthly forget not what you possess—
This is daily learning.
One day, restrain yourself and return to **ritual**,
And the realm will turn toward **virtue**—
This is daily decreasing in **Dao**."*

Learning and **Dao**, though not separate,
Are yet far apart.
To enter the **Dao**, one must first learn—
Without learning, one knows not the **Dao**,
Hence it is said: *"To learn is to daily increase."*
Yet when one reaches the **Dao**,
Learning is inherently nonexistent—
If one still clings to learning as master,
It will only harm the **Dao**.
One must decrease what is learned
Before entering the **Dao**,
Hence it is said: *"To cultivate the **Dao** is to daily decrease."*

Is it merely daily decreasing?
Decrease again, decrease again,
Until **self** and **all** are exhausted—
Only then does one reach **non-action**.
**Non-action**, yet nothing remains undone.
When the **Dao** of the realm is attained,
What further need is there for action?

Thus, the **Sage** takes all that can be done,
Ever maintaining **non-action** in body and mind,
And finds fulfillment within.
Yet when action arises,
It is seized upon—
And yet it remains insufficient to take the realm.

**Virtue** says:
*"Daily use money and shoes—
This is daily learning.
Mysterious **non-action**—
This is daily decreasing in **Dao**.*
The **Mysterious Law** has three thousand six hundred gates—
Learners cling to one as root—
This is daily learning.
Who knows the slightest **Dao** of the **Immortal**,
Not found in the three thousand six hundred gates—
This is daily decreasing in **Dao**.
Decrease again, decrease again,
Until **non-action**—
**Non-action**, not *not-doing*,
But **non-action** while doing—
Great doing indeed.
Thus, to take the realm, one must act with **non-action**.

To cure before illness arises—
Illness cannot be cured.
When sickness has formed and is treated,
When disease has formed and is attacked—
It is like digging a well when already thirsty.
Is this not too late?
Hence it is said:
When action arises,
It proves insufficient to take the realm.

**Chapter 49: The Sage Has No Constant Heart**

The **Sage** has no constant heart,
Taking the hearts of the people as his own.
The good, I also make good;
The ungood, I also make good—
**Virtue** is thus good.
The trustworthy, I also trust;
The untrustworthy, I also trust—
**Virtue** is thus trustworthy.

The **Sage** in the realm,
Ever blending hearts with the people,
While the people fix their ears and eyes,
The **Sage** treats them all as infants.

The **Classics** say:
*"The **Sage** has no constant heart,
Taking the hearts of the people as his own.
Thus, the good, I also make good;
The ungood, I also make good—
My **virtue** is good.
The trustworthy, I also trust;
The untrustworthy, I also trust—
My **virtue** is trustworthy.
The **Sage** in the realm,
Long maintaining **incarnate reverence**,
Ever blending hearts with the people,
While the people fix their ears and eyes,
The **Sage** treats them all as infants."*

The **Dao** says:
*"Shun plowed, tilled, made pottery, and fished,
Yet even as **Emperor**, he took all goodness from the people.
Yu said:
'I survey the realm—
Even a foolish man or woman
Could surpass me.'
Thus, the **Sage** has no constant heart,
Taking the hearts of the people as his own.
The good, I also make good—
This is already good.
The ungood, I also make good—
What does this mean?
If they are taught and transformed,
How do we know they will not become good?
Thus it is said: *My **virtue** is good.*
The trustworthy, I also trust—
This is already trustworthy.
The untrustworthy, I also trust—
What does this mean?
If they are taught and transformed,
How do we know they will not become trustworthy?
Thus it is said: *My **virtue** is trustworthy.*

Therefore, the **Sage** in the realm,
Long maintaining **incarnate reverence**,
Ever blending hearts with the people.
**Emperor Yao** was serene and reverent,
Profoundly respectful and yielding,
His radiance extending to all quarters,
His harmony reaching above and below—
Thus the people gazed upon him like the sun and moon,
Regarded him as parents,
All fixing their ears and eyes
To hear of the realm’s governance.
The **Sage** also cherishes them as infants,
Viewing them as if wounded—
Hence it is said: *He treats them all as infants.*

**Virtue** says:
*"The **Sage** is the master of **Spirit**.
The constant heart is **Spirit**.
The people are the **zang-fu** organs.
As the five **zang** organs each have **Spirit**,
The heart governs them.
As the five **zang** organs each have **essence**,
The kidneys store them.
The **Sage**, having no constant heart,
Takes the hearts of the people as his own—
Thus he attains mastery over **Spirit**,
Hence it is said:
*'Without thought, without action,
**Spirit** is mysterious and governance unified,
True **qi** harmoniously ascends—
**Spirit** governs it.
True **qi** is obstructed—
**Spirit** also governs it.
Thus, when **Spirit** is balanced, the heart is harmonious;
When the heart is balanced, **qi** is harmonious;
When **qi** is harmonious, the four **symbols** and five **phases**,
The nine **orifices** and three **vital gates**
Generate and restrain each other,
All finding their proper place—
Hence it is said:
*"Eat in season, the hundred bones are orderly;
Stir the **mechanism**, ten thousand transformations are at ease."*
Is this not what is meant?

The beneficial **qi**, I also treat well;
The unbeneficial **qi**, I also treat well—
My **virtue** treats it well.
The unbeneficial **qi**—
What further need is there?
It must also be treated well.
Trust and distrust are likewise so.

The **Sage** in the realm,
**Spirit** and **humanity** in the heart—
Unsettled yet settled,
**Non-action** yet doing—
Thus he attains settledness and **non-action**.

When **true qi** arrives beneficially,
My **virtue** follows and treats it well;
When **true qi** arrives unbeneficially,
My **virtue** harmonizes and treats it well—
This is also treating it well.
Trust and distrust are likewise so.

The **Sage** blends his heart with the realm,
**Spirit** and **humanity** blend their **qi** with the five **zang**,
The people fix their ears and eyes,
The five **zang** unify their nature—
The **Sage** treats them all as infants,
Nurturing the body as an infant—
Rich indeed are these words!"

Shun ruled the realm,
Selected from the masses,
And elevated **Gao Yao**—
Then the unvirtuous were distant indeed.

Tang ruled the realm,
Selected from the masses,
And elevated **Yi Yin**—
Then the unvirtuous were distant indeed.

With the unvirtuous now distant,
How could there not be peace and tranquility?

**Chapter Fifty: Life and Death**

Life and death are but two paths—
Thirteen parts of ten lead to life,
Thirteen parts of ten lead to death,
And thirteen parts of ten bring humanity into perilous grounds of death.

Why is this so?
Because of the **Dao**’s abundant nurturing of life.

It is said that those who skillfully cultivate life
Walk upon land without encountering **rhi** or **tiger**,
Enter battle without being struck by armor or weapons.

The **rhi** finds no place to lodge its horns,
The **tiger** finds no place to set its claws,
The weapons find no place to hold their blades.

Why is this so?
Because there are no grounds of death.

The **Classics** state:
To go forth is to live,
To enter is to die.
Of those who live by the **Dao**’s nurturing, thirteen parts of ten thrive,
Of those who die by their own doing, thirteen parts of ten perish,
And thirteen parts of ten bring humanity into perilous grounds of death.

Why is this so?
Because of the **Dao**’s abundant nurturing of life.

It is said that those who excel in the **Dao** of nurturing life
Walk upon land without encountering **rhi** or **tiger**,
Enter battle without being struck by armor or weapons.

Thus, the **rhi** has no place to lodge its horns,
The **tiger** has no place to set its claws,
The weapons have no place to hold their blades.

Why is this so?
Because the **Dao** contains no grounds of death.

The **Dao** speaks:
Heaven is the realm where thirteen parts of ten thrive,
Earth is the realm where thirteen parts of ten perish,
And humanity, when stirred into motion, also falls into thirteen parts of ten grounds of death.

To go forth is to live,
To enter is to die.
Life is the root of death,
Death is the root of life—
This is the **Dao** of returning to origins and completing the cycle.

Heaven and Earth as one, a single cycle of **129,600 years**.
Heaven has ten **Gān** (heavenly stems), from **Jiǎ** to **Gēng**, seven positions totaling **97,200 years**—Heaven’s life-number.
**Xīn, Rén, and Guǐ**, three positions totaling **38,810 years**—Heaven’s death-number.
Thus, thirteen parts of ten thrive.

Earth has twelve **Zhī** (earthly branches). From the summer solstice, **Yín** to **Xū**, nine positions totaling **97,200 years**—Earth’s life-number.
**Hài, Zǐ, and Chǒu**, three positions totaling **32,400 years**—Earth’s death-number.
Thus, thirteen parts of ten perish.

Twelve multiplied by nine—also seven parts of ten.
Heaven and Earth in one year, **360 days**, from **Kāiwù Yín** to **Bìwù Xū**, **270 days**—Earth’s life-number.
**Hài, Zǐ, Chǒu**, three months, **90 days**—Earth’s death-number.

**Qián** and **Kūn**’s cycles, **360 days** in total—
From **Jiǎ** to **Gēng**, **252 days**—Heaven’s life-number.
**Xīn, Rén, Guǐ**, three positions, **108 days**—Heaven’s death-number.
Thus, it is said: thirteen parts of ten thrive, thirteen parts of ten perish.

**Kāng Jié** said: The exchange of Heaven and Earth, thirteen parts of ten—this is precisely it.
**Kūn**’s number is **108**, now used by the **Buddhist School** in studies of day and night.

Human day and night, **100 kè**, totaling **13,500 breaths**,
Subtracting **4 kè** of decay, leaving **12,960 breaths**.
From **Yín** to **Xū**, **9,720 breaths**—human life-number.
**Hài, Zǐ, Chǒu**, three times, **3,240 breaths**—human death-number.
Thus, it is said: humanity’s motion into grounds of death is also thirteen parts of ten.

**Kāng Jié** said: Heaven does not rest in winter and spring, yet cannot nurture life;
Humanity does not rest in night and day, yet cannot discern affairs.
Thus, one must not move at night—
To move is to enter grounds of death.
Why dare one move?
Because of the **Dao**’s abundant nurturing of life.

It is said that those who excel in nurturing life
Walk upon land without encountering **rhi** or **tiger**—
Unmatched beneath the heavens.
**Zǐyáng** said:
*"Dragging a white tiger home to raise,
It bears a pearl like the full moon’s glow.
If not encountered, then well—
If encountered, it serves one’s purpose—what harm?"*

Enter battle without being struck by armor or weapons—
The noble one at rest values the left,
In battle values the right.
Not occupying the right—what harm is there?
The utmost softness traverses the utmost firmness.

The **rhi** is yet more fierce than the tiger, with horns and head.
Though the **rhi** has horns, it finds no place to lodge them;
Though the tiger has claws, it finds no place to set them;
Though weapons have blades, they find no place to hold them.
Why is this so?
Because there are no grounds of death.

Without death-city—
This is called a well-closed gate with no key yet unopenable,
A well-bound knot with no cord yet unsolvable.
Is there any space between grounds of death?

**Chapter Fifty-One of the *Dao* that Generates:**
The **Dao** generates it,
**Virtue** nurtures it,
Things take form from it,
Circumstances complete it—
Thus, all things do not fail to honor the **Dao** and revere **virtue**.

The **Dao**’s eminence, **virtue**’s nobility—
None command them, yet they persist naturally.

Thus, the **Dao** generates, nurtures, lengthens, and matures it,
Fosters and shelters it.
To generate without possession,
To act without control,
To lengthen without domination—
This is called **Mysterious Virtue**.

The **Classics** say:
The **Dao** of Heaven generates it,
The **virtue** of Earth nurtures it,
The **Creator** shapes it,
The **moment** completes it—
Thus, all things do not fail to honor the **Dao** and revere **virtue**.

**Chapter Fifty-One of the *Dao* that Generates (Continued):**
Thus, the **Dao**’s eminence, **virtue**’s nobility—
None command them, yet they persist naturally.

Hence, the **Dao** and **virtue** generate and nurture it,
The **Creator** lengthens and fosters it,
Circumstances complete and mature it,
The sun and moon nourish and shelter it.
To generate without claiming it as mine,
To act without relying upon it,
To lengthen without ruling it—
This is called **Mysterious Virtue**.

The **Dao** speaks:
The **Dao** is called *that which generates things*.
**Virtue** is called *that which nurtures things*.
Things are called *that which takes form*.
Circumstances are called *that which completes things*.
Thus, all things do not fail to honor the **Dao** and revere **virtue**.

Great is the **Primordial of Heaven (乾元)**,
The origin from which all things arise,
Unifying the heavens.
Clouds move, rain descends,
All creatures manifest their forms.
The **Dao** of Heaven transforms and changes,
Each returning to its proper nature and destiny.

The **Dao** is called *that which generates things*.
Supreme is the **Primordial of Earth (坤元)**,
The source from which all things are nourished,
Obediently following Heaven.
Earth’s thickness bears all things,
Its **virtue** boundless and unending.
It embraces and illuminates the vast,
All creatures flourish in harmony.
**Virtue** is called *that which nurtures things*.
Thunder and rain strike—
All fruits, grasses, and trees crack and split.
Things are called *that which takes form*.
**Fui (兑)** is the true autumn—
All things rejoice in **Fui**.
Circumstances are called *that which completes things*.

Thus, the **Dao**’s eminence, **virtue**’s nobility—
None command them, yet they persist naturally.
Why so? Because they generate and nurture,
Lengthen and foster,
Complete and mature,
Nourish and shelter.

Thus, the Sage generates without possession,
Acts without reliance,
Lengthens without domination—
For this is the **Mysterious Virtue** of Heaven’s profound **power**.
What has it to do with me?
Hence it is called **Mysterious Virtue**.

**Virtue** speaks:
**Qian (乾)** is Heaven, thus called *Father*,
And it generates the three daughters—**Xun (巽)**, **Li (离)**, **Fui (兑)**.
**Kun (坤)** is Earth, thus called *Mother*,
And it contains the three sons—**Zhen (震)**, **Kan (坎)**, **Gen (艮)**.
**Qian** and **Kun** stretch vertically,
While the six children lie horizontally—
Within them form the things of thunder, wind, water, fire, mountain, and marsh.
Within them complete the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter.
Thus all things arise together,
None failing to honor the **Dao** and revere **virtue**.

Master Zhu Xi says:
First, take **Qian** and **Kun** as the cauldron,
Then add the black hare elixir to refine.
Once the two substances return to the Yellow **Dao**,
How could the Golden Elixir fail to manifest?

Thus, the **Dao**’s eminence, **virtue**’s nobility—
None command them, yet they persist naturally.
Hence, the **Dao** of **Qian** generates,
The **virtue** of **Kun** nurtures,
**Zhen** and **Xun** lengthen and foster,
**Kan** and **Li** complete and mature,
**Gen** and **Fui** nourish and shelter—
All under Heaven’s affairs are fulfilled.

Thus, the Sage generates without possession,
Later completing Heaven and Earth’s **Dao** with wealth;
Acts without reliance,
For when I do nothing, the people transform themselves;
Lengthens without domination,
For I am the sovereign of the ancestral altars.
Hence it is called **Mysterious Virtue**.

**Chapter Fifty-Two of the *Dao* that Begins All Under Heaven:**
All under Heaven has a beginning,
And it is called the *Mother of all under Heaven*.
Having obtained its Mother,
One knows its children.
Having known its children,
One returns to guard its Mother—
Thus, one’s life is never in peril.

Close **Fui** and shut its gate,
And one’s life will never be weary.
Open **Fui** and advance its affairs,
And one’s life will never be saved.

To see what is small is called *clarity*,
To hold to what is soft is called *strength*.
To use its light and return to its clarity—
No calamity will befall one’s body.
This is called *following the constant*.

The **Classics** say:
All under Heaven has a beginning,
And the beginning is called the *Mother of all under Heaven*.
Having known its Mother,
One knows its children—
The children are things.
Having known its children,
One returns to guard its Mother—
Thus, one’s life is never in peril.

Close **Fui**—**Fui** is *joy*.
Shut its gate—its gate is its *door*.
Thus, one’s life will never be weary.
Open **Fui** and advance its affairs,
And one’s life will never be saved.

To see what is small is called *clarity*—
Knowing the beginning.
To hold to what is soft is called *strength*—
Overcoming hardness.
To use its light—*the children*.
To return to its clarity—*the Mother*.
Returning clarity to use light—
No calamity will befall one’s body.
Light and clarity without calamity—
This is called *following the constant*.

The **Dao** speaks:
The *Nameless* is the beginning of Heaven and Earth,
That which is above form is called the **Dao**.
The *Named* is the Mother of all things,
That which is below form is called *instrumentality*.
All under Heaven has a beginning,
And it is called the *Mother of all under Heaven*.
Thus, the Sage, having known its Mother,
Becomes the master of all things.
Things are the *children*.
The Mother is the **Dao**.
Having known its children,
One returns to guard its Mother—
Thus, one’s life is never in peril.

Close **Fui**—**Fui** is *joy*.
All things emerge from **Zhen**—**Zhen** is the east.
All things rejoice in **Fui**—**Fui** is true autumn.
**Zhen** is the eldest son, thunder.
**Fui** is the youngest daughter, the marsh.
**Zhen**, the elder brother, generates it,
**Fui**, the younger sister, completes it—
Hence it is called *Returning the Younger Sister*.
The *Symbol* says:
*The marsh above, thunder below*—
The gentleman returns the younger sister,
To eternally know exhaustion and decay.
The *Hexagram Commentary* says:
*Returning the Younger Sister*—
This is the great principle of Heaven and Earth.
Heaven and Earth do not unite,
And all things would not flourish.
*Returning the Younger Sister*—
This is the end and beginning of humanity.
Returning to **Qian**, it is the opening of the gate.
Meeting **Kun**, it is the closing of the gate.
Thus, it is said:
Close **Fui**, shut its gate—
One’s life will never be weary.
**Kun** conceals it,
**Qian** knows the **Dao** of the Great Beginning.
Metal and water generate each other,
Counteracting yet harmonizing—
The child returns, one *yang* reborn,
Again the beginning of opening the gate.
Fire is born from wood,
Disaster arises and overcomes—
At noon, meeting one *yin*,
Again the beginning of closing the gate.
Thus, it is said:
Open **Fui**, advance its affairs—
One’s life will never be saved.
**Qian** governs as sovereign,
**Kun** completes the **Dao** of things.

To see what is small is called *clarity*—
When *yin* first treads on frost,
One knows rigid ice is near.
Hardness grows and lengthens—
How could August not be inauspicious?
To hold to what is soft is called *strength*—
The utmost softness can traverse the utmost hardness under Heaven.

「Thus it is said:
Utilize its radiance—
Now one knows its **child**,
Return to its clarity—
Now one holds to its **mother**.
No harm shall befall one’s body,
And one’s life shall never be in peril.
He who guards this **Dao** is said:
To follow its eternal principle.

**Virtue** speaks:
Under Heaven, all things have a beginning,
The **Primordial Qi** of the **Preheaven** is the **mother**,
The **Great Polarization** is a single cycle,
The **Original Yang** is a single point,
The **Great Unity** is a single stroke.
That which exists is taken as the **mother** of all things—
Is this not fitting?
Having known its **mother**,
One knows its **child**.
Concentrating on **qi** and governing softness,
Can one truly emulate the innocence of an infant?
Having known its **child**,
Return again to its **mother**,
And one’s life shall be eternal—
Thus, one’s life shall never be lost.

Not holding to its **mother**,
One does not know the eternal principle,
And rash actions bring disaster.
To block its **Fui**—
This is the **Dao** of the **Tiger**.
To close—
Its **mysterious feminine gate** need not be as enduring as if it were preserved,
Thus, one’s life shall never be in peril.

To open its **Fui**,
And take rashness as the eternal principle,
To advance its affairs,
And extinguish *yang* with *yin*—
Not meeting the **Perfect Sage**,
One’s life shall never be saved.

To see what is small is called *clarity*—
This is the discussion of subtle permeation,
And the superficial appearance of **qi**.
To hold to softness is called *strength*—
With softness overcoming hardness,
And weakness overcoming strength.
Utilize its radiance,
Return again to its clarity—
**Child** and **mother** generate each other,
**Lead** and **Mercury** refine and transform each other.

To trifle with **Divine Tools**,
One’s body shall surely meet an early doom—
Thus it is said:
No harm shall befall one’s body.

This **Dao** long mastered,
Is called to follow the eternal principle.

**Chapter Fifty-Three: The Sage’s Warning**
If I were to be upright and discerning,
Walking the **Great Dao**,
I would fear only the act of giving.
The **Great Dao** is most smooth,
Yet people prefer shortcuts.
The court is most orderly,
Yet fields lie abandoned,
Granaries are most empty,
Yet officials wear ornate robes,
And carry sharp blades—
They loathe plain food,
Though wealth overflows—
This is called the **boast of the thief**,
Not the **Dao** indeed.

The **Classic** says:
If I were to be upright and discerning,
Walking the **Great Dao**,
I would fear only spreading **virtue** to all under Heaven—
This is truly something to be feared.
The **Great Dao** is most smooth,
Yet people prefer shortcuts.
The court is most orderly,
Yet fields lie desolate,
Granaries are most depleted—
All wear ornate robes,
Carry sharp blades,
Loathe plain food,
And wealth overflows—
This is called boasting in theft,
Not the **Dao** indeed.

The **Dao** says:
Upright as stone,
One shall not last the day.
The **perfect** and the **auspicious** are upright as stone,
Yet their affairs endure through the day—
This is how one can distinguish them.

The **Noble Man** knows the subtle and the manifest,
Knows softness and knows hardness—
The hope of ten thousand people,
To be upright and discerning,
Walking the **Great Dao**.

Fear only spreading **virtue** to all under Heaven,
For this is truly something to be feared.
The **Great Dao** is most smooth and level,
Yet people love shortcuts.
The court is most orderly,
Yet fields lie desolate,
Granaries are most barren—
All officials wear ornate robes,
And carry sharp blades,
Loathe plain food,
And wealth overflows—
This is called the **boast of the thief**,
Not the **Dao** indeed.

The *Yijing* says:
*"To bear and to ride—
This brings bandits to your doorstep."*
**To bear** is the affair of the **petty man**,
**To ride** is the tool of the **Noble Man**.
The **petty man** riding the **Noble Man’s** tool,
Thieves will surely covet it.
The **ruler** being arrogant above,
And the **subjects** violent below—
Thieves will surely strike them.
**Arrogance** hides **virtue** and invites thieves,
**Artifice** adorns the face and invites **lust**.

The *Yijing* says:
*"To bear and to ride—
This brings bandits to your doorstep."*
This is the **thief’s** invitation.

**Virtue** speaks:
If I were to be upright and discerning,
Walking the **Great Dao**,
I would fear only spreading **virtue** and teaching **transformation** to people—
This is truly something to be feared.
The **Great Dao** is most smooth and level,
Yet people refuse to walk the earth steadily—
Their steps and strides all prefer shortcuts,
Yet they wish for swift completion.

Thus the **Purple Court’s** saying:
*"Not knowing true **Lead** and the **ancestral lineage**,
All efforts in alchemy are in vain.*
To dismiss one’s wife in vain,
To teach **fasting** while blocking **yin-yang**,
To instruct **celestial fasting** while leaving the **intestines empty**,
Yet herbs, metals, and minerals are all mere dross—
**Clouds** and **mists**, sun and moon,
Belong to the realm of illusion.
Even more, to indulge in **breathwork** and **visualization**,
All these differ entirely from **Golden Elixir** affairs.
Thus it is said:
The **Great Dao** is most smooth,
Yet people prefer shortcuts.

The **court** is the **body**,
The **fields** are **affairs**,
The **granaries** are **internal nourishment**,
**Ornate robes** are **external adornment**—
The **body** is most orderly,
**Affairs** are most chaotic,
**Internal nourishment** is most empty,
**External adornment** is most grand—
Yet they carry sharp blades to aid them,
Loathe plain food and instead take **medicines**,
And hoard surplus wealth—
Daily boasting in the ways of **lust** and **theft**,
They shall soon decay—
This is surely not the **Great Dao**.

**Zhu Yáng** further says:
*"Not knowing **yin-yang** nor master and guest,
Who then knows which is distant and which is close?*
To close the **Chamber of Repose** and block the **Tail Gate** and **Orifice**,
One has mistakenly slain countless **Yánfú**—
This is exactly what is meant.

**Chapter Fifty-Four: The Foundation of Goodness Cannot Be Uprooted**」

**Chapter Fifty-Five: The Depth of Contained Virtue**

That which is well-established cannot be uprooted,
That which is well-embraced cannot be cast off—
Thus, descendants offer sacrifices without ceasing.

Cultivate it in the self, and its virtue becomes **authentic**;
Cultivate it in the family, and its virtue becomes **abundant**;
Cultivate it in the village, and its virtue becomes **enduring**;
Cultivate it in the state, and its virtue becomes **prosperous**;
Cultivate it in the world, and its virtue becomes **universal**.

Thus, observe the self with the self,
Observe the family with the family,
Observe the village with the village,
Observe the state with the state,
Observe the world with the world.
How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

The **Classic** says:
*"Those who establish goodness in the **Dao** cannot be uprooted,
Those who embrace goodness in **virtue** cannot be cast off—
Descendants thus offer sacrifices without ceasing.
Cultivate it in the self, and its virtue becomes **authentic**;
Cultivate it in the family, and its virtue becomes **abundant**;
Cultivate it in the village, and its virtue becomes **enduring**;
Cultivate it in the state, and its virtue becomes **prosperous**;
Cultivate it in the world, and its virtue becomes **universal**.
Thus, observe the self with the self, and it does not differ from **authenticity**;
Observe the family with the family, and it does not differ from **abundance**;
Observe the village with the village, and it does not differ from **endurance**;
Observe the state with the state, and it does not differ from **prosperity**;
Observe the world with the world, and it does not differ from **universality**.
How do I know the world is thus?
By this, indeed.

The **Dao** says:
*'Those who establish goodness in the **Dao**—
When one **yang** returns in **revolution**,
The **Potential Dragon** remains hidden, unused,
Firm in its unassailable nature.
Those who embrace goodness in **virtue**—
Washing the heart, aligning restraints,
Retreating to concealment in secrecy,
Firm in its unseverable nature.
Thus, those who establish and embrace goodness in **Dao** and **virtue**,
Do not serve kings and nobles,
But hold their affairs in **high esteem**—
Hence, the **sixth line’s** *dry* **snare** for the father,
In intent honoring the ancestors,
Thus it is said: *"Descendants offer sacrifices without ceasing."*

By this **Dao** and **virtue** cultivated in the self,
The self becomes **authentic**;
Cultivated in the family,
The family becomes **abundant**;
Cultivated in the village,
The village becomes **enduring**;
Cultivated in the state,
The state becomes **prosperous**;
Cultivated in the world,
The world becomes **universal**.
Thus, observe one self among myriad selves,
And its virtue grows ever **authentic**;
Observe one family among myriad families,
And its virtue grows ever **abundant**;
Observe one village among myriad villages,
And its virtue grows ever **enduring**;
Observe one state among myriad states,
And its virtue grows ever **prosperous**;
Observe one world among countless worlds,
And its virtue grows ever **universal**.
How do I know this of countless worlds?
By this **Dao** and **virtue**, unrooted and unsevered.

**Virtue** says:
*Zhu Xián* has said:
*"One month’s return is one revolution,
One year’s nine revolutions and returns are the same—
Only by relying on the **Eight Trigrams** do we infer **punishments** and **virtues**,
Five and six return to **Wu** and **Ji** in the center.
Thus, the **Black Tortoise** and **Hare** bathe,
Firm in their unseverable nature;
The **Potential Dragon** remains unused,
Firm in its unassailable nature.
Hence it is said: *Those who establish well cannot be uprooted,
Those who embrace well cannot be cast off.*
This **Dao** began with **Fuxi**,
Transmitted mouth-to-mouth until today,
Neither absent from nor separate from texts—
How much less the descendants of **Shang** whose glory is uncountable?
Generation after generation, all are descendants—
What fear is there of sacrifices?
By this, cultivation in the self, the village,
Even to the state and the world,
Is without limit in its efficacy.

Thus, the **Sage** takes the world as self,
And observes its **authenticity**;
Takes the world as family,
And observes its **abundance**;
Takes the world as village,
And observes its **endurance**;
Takes the world as state,
And observes its **prosperity**;
Takes the world as world,
And observes its **universality**.
By this observation alone,
What is it but that before there were countless years,
And after there shall be countless ages?
By this, I know it.

**Chapter Fifty-Five: The Depth of Contained Virtue**

The depth of contained **virtue** is like that of an **innocent babe**.
Poisonous creatures do not sting,
Ferocious beasts do not seize,
Raptors do not strike.
Bones are frail, sinews supple, yet their grasp is firm—
Unknowing of **male-female union**, yet **qi** naturally surges—
The **essence** is at its peak.
All day it cries, yet its voice does not falter—
**Harmony** is at its peak.
To know **harmony** is to know **constancy**,
To know **constancy** is to know **clarity**.
**Life’s increase** is called **auspicious**,
The **heart’s command** of **qi** is called **strength**.
When things reach their peak, they grow old—
This is called **not the Dao**,
And **not the Dao** must be abandoned early.

The **Classic** says:
*"The depth of contained **virtue** is like that of an **innocent babe**.
Poisonous creatures do not sting,
Ferocious beasts do not seize,
Raptors do not strike—
There is no **place of death**.
Bones are frail, sinews supple,
Yet the grasp is exceedingly firm.
Unknowing of **male-female union**, yet **qi** naturally surges—
The **essence** is at its peak.
All day it cries, yet its voice does not falter—
**Harmony** is at its peak.
To know **harmony** is to know **constancy**,
To know **constancy** is to know **clarity**.
**Constancy** and **clarity** generate **increase**—
Its name is **auspicious**.
The **heart’s command** of **qi**—
Its name is **strength**.
When things reach their peak, they grow old—
This is called **not the Dao**.
Since it is **not the Dao**,
It is better to abandon it early."*

The **Dao** says:
*"Those skilled in **nourishing life**,
Contain **virtue** deeply, like the **innocent babe**—
On land, they do not encounter **rhinos** or **tigers**,
In battle, they are unharmed by weapons.
**Rhinos** have no place to lodge their horns,
**Tigers** no place to strike with claws,
Weapons no place to lodge their blades.
Why is this?
Because they have no **place of death**.
Thus it is said: *Poisonous creatures do not sting,
Ferocious beasts do not seize,
Raptors do not strike.*

Now, the **innocent babe** is not yet complete—
At five months, it begins to smile,
At eight months, teeth emerge,
By three years, its lips close,
And it can speak and eat—
Yet it knows nothing of the world.
Because it knows nothing,
It has no **place of death**.
Thus, bones are most frail,
Sinews most supple,
Yet the grasp is firm on its own.
Even unknowing of **male-female union**, yet **qi** naturally surges—
The **essence** is at its peak.
All day it cries, yet its voice does not falter—
**Harmony** is at its peak.
To know **harmony** is to know **constancy** and **clarity**,
**Constancy** and **clarity** generate **increase**—
Observing and verifying **auspiciousness**,
Its revolution is **greatly auspicious**.
If not attained in the **heart**, do not seek it in **qi**.
Now, those who stumble or rush—
This is **qi**.
The **heart** is the master of **qi."*

**Qi** is the master of the body.
When **qi** follows the **heart**, it is in **harmony**;
When the **heart** compels **qi**, it is in **strength**.

If the **heart** is in **strength**, it will decline;
If things are at their peak, they will age—
This is called **not the Dao**.

Since it is **not the Dao**,
It is better to cease early.

**Virtue** is spoken of thus:
To hold **virtue** thick as an infant,
To focus **qi** and achieve **softness**,
One can be like a babe.

When **yin** arises, water advances;
When **yang** arises, fire advances—
Water and fire tempered by wood,
Lead and mercury in floating and sinking,
Ten months, the fetus is complete;
Three years, it sheds its shell.

The **stinging insect** is the **corpse insect**;
The **clutching beast** is the **Dragon and Tiger**;
The **struggling crow** is the **Crow and Hare**—
Thus, the three **Péng** have no place to lodge their venom,
Metal and wood have no place to wield their ferocity,
Sun and moon have no place to contain their grasp.

Why is this so?
Because they have no **place of death**.

Bones are frail, sinews supple—
Lead, mercury, wood, and metal float in uncertainty, yet remain undetermined.
Fingers and palms grasp firmly—
Heaven’s patterns and Earth’s features dare not reveal themselves lightly.

Though **male-female union** is unknown, yet **qi** naturally surges—
In three months, male and female take form;
The kidneys arise first—
**Essence** is at its peak.

All day it cries, yet its voice does not falter—
The **Elixir Field** is firm and sealed,
The **Sea of Qi** is mixed and complete—
**Harmony** is at its peak.

To know **harmony** is to know **constancy**—
The **Dao** without beginning or name.
To know **constancy** is to know **clarity**—
The **Dao** without attachment or gain.
**Constancy** and **clarity** bring **increase**—
Great and encompassing, reaching the **divine**,
The realm of **auspiciousness**.

This is **wuwei** yet nothing is left undone,
Taking the world with **non-action**.
When there is **action**, it is insufficient to take the world—
For the **heart** compels **qi** to **strength**.

Thus, the **heart** in **strength** declines,
Things at their peak age—
This is called **not the Dao**.
Since it is **not the Dao**,
It is better to cease early.

**Chapter Fifty-Six: The Wise Do Not Speak**
The wise do not speak;
Those who speak do not know.

Close its **mouth** (兑),
Shut its **door** (门),
Dull its **sharpness**,
Unravel its **chaos**,
Blend its **light**,
Unify its **dust**—
This is called **mysterious unity**.

Thus, it cannot be drawn near,
Cannot be pushed away,
Cannot be used for gain,
Cannot be used for harm,
Cannot be exalted,
Cannot be belittled—
Therefore, it is held in honor by the world.

The **Scripture** says:
Those who know do not speak,
Those who speak do not know.
Thus, close its **mouth** (兑),
Shut its **door** (门),
Dull its **sharpness**,
Unravel its **chaos**,
Blend its **light**,
Unify its **dust**—
This is called **mysterious unity of Heaven**.

Therefore, it cannot be drawn near,
Cannot be pushed away,
Cannot be used for gain,
Cannot be used for harm,
Cannot be exalted,
Cannot be belittled—
Thus, it is held in honor by the world.

The **Dao** is spoken of thus:
Ancient scholars cultivated for themselves,
The wise did not speak.

Modern scholars cultivate for others,
Those who speak do not know.

Heaven speaks not—
The four seasons march in its course;
Earth speaks not—
The myriad things grow in its embrace.
The wise do not speak.

With reverence, they teach the people their proper times;
They follow the **symbols** of sun and moon;
Eastward they till, westward they harvest;
They smooth the **valleys** and divide the **hills**—
Those who speak do not know.

Thus it is said:
When the **Great Dao** is abandoned,
There arise **ren** and **yi**,
And **wisdom** and **cleverness** emerge—
This is the **Great Deception**.

Better to close its **mouth** (兑) and not speak,
For speech not guided by the **Dao** is no speech.
Better to shut its **door** (门) and not act,
For action not guided by the **Dao** is no action.
To dull the **sharpness** of all things and speak,
So that they bear **great fruit**.
To unravel the **chaos** of the people,
So that they follow their **tasks**.
To blend the **light** of sun and moon,
To unify the **dust** of the world—
Though called **mysterious unity of Heaven**, this is **mysterious unity**.

Thus, those who embrace this **Dao**,
Do not serve kings or nobles,
Hold their **affairs** high and pure—
Therefore, they cannot be drawn near,
Cannot be pushed away,
Cannot be used for gain,
Cannot be used for harm,
Cannot be exalted,
Cannot be belittled.

The **Son of Heaven** cannot command them as subjects,
The feudal lords cannot claim them as friends—
Is this not to be held in honor by the world?

**Virtue** is spoken of thus:
Those who perceive **heart** and **nature** to the point of **command**,
Retreat and hide in **secrecy**,
Fearful that others may know—
Would they dare to shape words?

To glimpse a leopard through a tube,
Seeing only a patch—
Yet they strive to boast to others,
Fearful that they may not be known—
Would they dare not to speak?

Thus it is said:
The wise do not speak;
Those who speak do not know.

**Purple Yang** says:
*"Do not comprehend the inverted meaning within,
Do not presume to speak of things seen through a tube."*

Thus, those who have mastered this **Dao**,
Close its **yin mouth** (兑),
Shut its **yang door** (门),
Dull its **empty words**,
Unravel its **clamor**,
Blend its **radiance**,
Unify its **worldly dust**—
This is called **mysterious unity**.

**Mysterious** is called **unity**,
**Unity** is called **mysterious**—
**Mysterious** yet again **mysterious**,
The **gate of all wonders**.

It cannot be drawn near—
No proximity.
It cannot be pushed away—
No distance.
It cannot be used for gain—
No benefit.
It cannot be used for harm—
No loss.
It cannot be exalted—
No reverence.
It cannot be belittled—
No contempt.

Therefore, it is held in honor by the world.

**Chapter Fifty-Seven: Govern with Rectitude**
Govern with **rectitude**,
Employ the **unexpected** in war,
Take the world with **non-action**.

How do I know this to be true?
By this.

The world abounds in taboos,
Yet the people grow ever poorer.

Men multiply sharp tools,
And the state grows ever more confused.

The people multiply clever arts,
And strange things proliferate.

Laws and decrees grow ever more explicit,
Yet thieves and robbers abound.

Therefore, the Sage says:
*"If I act with non-action, the people transform themselves;
If I take no action, the people grow rich;
If I love stillness, the people align themselves;
If I have no desires, the people return to simplicity."*

The Classic states:
*"Govern with rectitude,
Employ the unexpected in war,
Take the world with non-action."*

How do I know this to be true?
By this **Dao**.

When the world abounds in taboos,
Yet the people grow ever poorer;
When men multiply sharp tools,
And the state grows ever more confused;
When the people multiply clever arts,
And strange things proliferate;
When laws and decrees grow ever more explicit,
Yet thieves and robbers abound—
All these are the effects of **action**.

Therefore, the Sage speaks, referring to the Three Sovereigns:
*"If I act with non-action, the people transform themselves;
If I take no action, the people grow rich;
If I love stillness, the people align themselves;
If I have no desires, the people return to simplicity."*

The **Dao** declares:
*"If the state is not governed with rectitude, it cannot be ruled;
If war is not waged with the unexpected, it cannot be won;
If the world is not taken with non-action, it cannot be claimed."*

How do I know this to be true?
By this **Dao**.

The people of the world do not suffer from poverty but from instability,
Nor from scarcity but from inequity.
For when equity is achieved, there is no poverty;
When harmony prevails, there is no scarcity;
When stability is secured, there is no upheaval.
Yet when actions are constrained by taboos,
The people grow ever poorer.

In the age of antiquity,
Rustic cups of mud and earthen drums were deemed proper rites,
Yet still sufficient to appease the spirits and gods—
The rites and music of that time were simple,
And the common folk possessed unfeigned sincerity.

In later ages,
Sacrificial grains and wine were displayed in halls,
Jade and bronze vessels adorned the doors,
With pipes, bells, strings, and bamboo—
Yet the spirits and gods were often unappeased—
For the rites and music had grown elaborate,
And the noble lost their sincerity.
The people multiplied their clever tools,
And the state grew ever more confused.

Meng Tian’s innovations began with non-action,
Yet he turned what was useless into what was useful,
And what was strange into what was practical—
Thus, flying wheels, crooked arrows, wooden oxen, and flowing horses were made,
And the people multiplied their clever arts,
While strange things proliferated.

When a single law reaches its limit,
A hundred deceits arise;
When an edict is issued,
A hundred frauds emerge—
Thus, when laws and decrees grow ever more explicit,
Thieves and robbers abound.

Therefore, the Sage speaks:
*"If I act with non-action, the people transform themselves—*
*Through the Dao transforming the Dao.*
*If I take no action, the people grow rich—*
*Through virtue teaching virtue.*
*If I love stillness, the people align themselves—*
*Through merit encouraging merit.*
*If I have no desires, the people return to simplicity—*
*Through strength commanding strength."*

Within these words lie the **Dao** of the **Huangdi**, the **Wang**, and the **Ba**.
**Virtue** declares:
*"To govern the state with rectitude,
And to guard one’s self with the Dao of rectitude.*
*To wage war with the unexpected,
And to gather medicines with the unexpected.*
*To claim the world with non-action,
And to nurture life without illness."*

Yet when decay sets in and action is taken,
It is no longer sufficient to claim the world.

Thus it is said:
*"How do I know this to be true?
By this **Dao**."*

The **Dao** is not difficult, yet the petty paths are most arduous.
The **Dao** knows no taboos, yet petty paths abound with them.

When the world teems with taboos, the people grow ever poorer;
When petty paths bristle with taboos, the self grows ever more diminished.

When men wield many sharp tools, the state grows ever more benighted;
When the self clings to many side paths, the mind grows ever more disordered.

When the people master many arts, strange things proliferate;
When the self guards with sturdy armor, sharp blades take life.

When laws grow ever more explicit, thieves and robbers multiply;
When precepts grow ever stricter, thieves grow ever more cunning.

All these are the work of petty paths.

Thus the Sage declares:
*"If I take no action, the people transform themselves—*
*By returning to their natural state.*
*If I have no affairs, the people grow rich—*
*By embracing simplicity.*
*If I love stillness, the people align themselves—*
*By reducing selfishness.*
*If I have no desires, the people return to simplicity—*
*By cultivating few desires."*

All these are the work of the **Great Dao**.

**Volume Four of the Three Explanations of the Dao-De Jing**
*Narrated by the Jade Guest, recorded by Deng Zhi*

**Chapter Fifty-Eight: "Its Governance is Murky"**

Its governance is murky, murky—
its people are pure, pure;
its governance is sharp, sharp—
its people are defective, defective.

Calamity, oh! Where fortune leans,
fortune, oh! Where calamity lies.
Who knows their utmost?
Is there no right or wrong?

The right turns to the strange,
the good turns to the demonic.
When the people are befuddled,
their days are long indeed.

Thus the Sage is square yet does not cut,
principled yet does not cleave,
upright yet does not flaunt,
radiant yet does not dazzle.

The Classic says:
*"Its governance murky and pure—*
*its people but pure;
*its governance sharp and fierce—*
*its people are broken, defective."*

Thus calamity, oh! Where fortune leans and lies,
when pushed to the extreme, is there no right or wrong?
The right may become the strange,
the good may turn demonic.
When the people are thus befuddled,
their days have long since passed.

Thus the Sage, though square yet does not cut,
principled yet does not cleave,
upright yet does not flaunt,
radiant yet does not dazzle.

The Dao says:
*"The people of Yao and Shun,*
*neighboring houses could be sealed—*
*their governance was murky, murky,*
*their people pure, pure.*

An elder struck the earth and said:
*'The sun rises and we toil,*
*the sun sets and we rest,*
*we dig wells to drink,*
*we till fields to eat—*
*what power does the Emperor hold over me?'*
Thus it was said: *neighboring houses could be sealed.*

*The people of Jie and Zhou,*
*neighboring houses could be slaughtered—*
*their governance was sharp, sharp,*
*their people defective, defective.*

On the day of *jiāzǐ* (甲子), before dawn,
they received their orders and led their troops like forests,
those before turned and hurled their spears,
attacking those behind, they fled northward,
blood flowed to float the pestles—
thus it was said: *neighboring houses could be slaughtered.*

Yao passed the throne to Dan Zhu through Shun,
Shun passed the throne to Shang Jun through Yu—
calamity, oh! Where fortune leans.
Tang and Wu revolutionized,
following Heaven and responding to the people—
fortune, oh! Where calamity lies.

Thus when leaning and lying reach the extreme,
is there no right or wrong in the Dao?"

「Thus Shun had four *zhēng* (凶), exiled and banished, yet his governance was deemed strange and virtuous.
Yin had three *rén* (仁), who freed slaves and slit their own bellies—
their kindness was called demonic.

The people’s confusion in this Dao/Way has long been established.

Hence the Sage measures it without severing its corners,
polishes it without dulling its edges,
straightens it without overdoing its rectitude,
shines it without blinding its brightness.

When one attains its *wúwéi* (無為) and naturalness,
then calamity and fortune cannot find room to lean or lie—
who again knows their limits?

The *virtue/power* (德) says:
When governance is *mènmèn* (昧昧), the people are *chúnhú* (醇醇),
the *qi* of Heaven precedes, the *qi* of Earth follows—
those who attain it are always as if drunk.

When governance is *cháchà* (察察), the people are *quēquē* (缺缺),
the sun has eclipses, the moon has eclipses,
reaching the *wù* (穷) of *wǔjǐ* (戊己), settling on *gēngjiǎ* (庚甲).

Adding to it brings loss,
calamity, oh! Fortune leans upon it.
Subtracting from it brings gain,
fortune, oh! Calamity lies beneath it.
Who knows their limits?
Is there no Dao/Way without right or wrong?

Strange governance becomes virtuous,
Dao/Way reaches its extreme and follows *quán* (權).
Kindness becomes demonic,
reason is exhausted and enters *shù* (術).

Ah! The people of the world have no Dao/Way to uphold,
their confusion by calamity and fortune has long been established.

Thus the Sage sees it but does not use it,
uses it but does not reveal it—
in the dim twilight, they meet,
in the obscure depths, changes occur.
Therefore, he opens *duì* (兑) to measure without further severing,
extracts *kǎn* (坎) to polish without need for carving,
takes *zhèn* (震) to straighten without overdoing,
adopts *lí* (离) to shine without blinding—
to make the people of the world attain naturalness and *wúwéi* (無為) and reach their *mìng* (命),
is this not great?

**Chapter 59: Governing People and Serving Heaven**

Governing people and serving Heaven—
nothing surpasses *sè* (啬).
Only through *sè* (啬) does one achieve *zǎochù* (早复).

*Zǎochù* (早复) is called *zhòngjīdé* (重积德),
and *zhòngjīdé* (重积德) means nothing cannot be overcome.
Nothing cannot be overcome means one cannot know its limits,
and if one cannot know its limits,
then one can have a state.
A state with such a foundation can endure long.

This is called the Dao/Way of *shēngrén jiǔshì* (深根固蒂、长生久视).

The *jing* (经) says:
Governing people and serving Heaven—
nothing surpasses *sè* (吝啬).
Only through *sè* (吝啬) does one achieve *zǎochù* (早复).

*Zǎochù* (早复) is called *zhòngjīdé* (重积德).
Accumulating *virtue/power* (德) repeatedly,
then nothing cannot be overcome.
Nothing cannot be overcome means one cannot know its limits.
If one cannot know its limits,
then one can have a state.
A state without such a foundation does not know its children.
A state with such a foundation can endure long.

This is called the Dao/Way of *shēngrén jiǔshì* (深根固蒂、长生久视).

The Dao/Way says:
*Kūn* (坤) embodies *sè* (吝啬),
one who bears *thick virtue/power* (厚德) and sustains all things.

Serving Heaven above, nourishing people below—
nothing surpasses *sè* (吝啬).
*Sè* (吝啬) is *Kūn* (坤) concealing it,
and all things flourish endlessly without exhaustion.

Only through *sè* (啬) does one achieve *zǎochù* (早复).
*Chù* (复) is *hēng* (亨), the *strong* (刚) returning.
Moving yet proceeding with gentleness,
thus entering and exiting without harm,
friends come without blame.

Returning its Dao/Way,
in seven days it comes to *chù* (复)—
this is the *Tianxíng* (天行).
*Chù* (复) reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth?

*Zǎochù* (早复) is called *zhòngjīdé* (重积德),
for *chù* (复) arises from *Kūn* (坤).
*Kūn* (坤) accumulates *virtue/power* (德) repeatedly,
and nothing cannot be overcome.
Nothing cannot be overcome means one cannot know its limits.
If one cannot know its limits,
then one can have a state.
Thus *Kūn* (坤) is the foundation of states and cities.
The children of a state are *zhèn* (震) restoring the eldest son.
The foundation of a state is *Kūn* (坤) as Earth, named Mother.
It can endure long,
for Heaven and Earth endure long.

This is called the Dao/Way of *shēngrén jiǔshì* (深根固蒂、长生久视),
and the *virtue/power* (德) unites without bounds.

The *virtue/power* (德) says:
Governing people and serving Heaven—
this is exhausting *lǐ* (理) and fulfilling *xìng* (性).
Nothing surpasses *sè* (啬) to reach one’s *mìng* (命).
Thus one achieves *zǎochù* (早复) in its Dao/Way.

All things are *yún* (芸) and *yún* (芸),
each returning to its root.

*Zǎochù* (早复) is called *zhòngjīdé* (重积德),
for one *yáng* (阳) comes to *chù* (复)—
this is *Kūn*’s (坤) repeated accumulation of *virtue/power* (德).

Repeated accumulation of *virtue/power* (德) means nothing cannot be overcome,
containing *principle* (弘) and great brightness,
all things flourish in harmony.

Nothing cannot be overcome means one cannot know its limits,
returning to *wújí* (无极).
If one cannot know its limits,
then one can have a state—
Earth follows and supports Heaven,
all states are thus at peace.

*Kūn* (坤) is the Mother of the state,
*chù* (复) is the Child of the state—
a state with such a foundation.
It can endure long,
for Heaven and Earth endure long.

Heaven and Earth endure long because they do not generate themselves,
thus they can long endure.
Hence it is said: This is called the Dao/Way of *shēngrén jiǔshì* (深根固蒂、长生久视).

**Chapter 60: Governing a Great State**

Governing a great state is like simmering a small fresh delicacy.
Using the Dao/Way to preside over the world,
its *guǐshén* (鬼神) are not *shén* (神).

Not that its *guǐshén* (鬼神) are not *shén* (神),
but that its *shén* (神) does not harm people;
Not that its *shén* (神) does not harm people,
but that the Sage also does not harm people.
When both do not harm each other,
then their *virtue/power* (德) returns and exchanges.

The *jing* (经) says:
Governing a great state is like simmering a small fresh delicacy,
one must not act.
Using the Dao/Way to preside over the world,
its *guǐshén* (鬼神) cannot become *shén* (神).
Not that its *guǐshén* (鬼神) are not *shén* (神),
but that its *shén* (神) does not harm people;
Not that its *shén* (神) does not harm people,
but that this is because the Sage does not harm people.
When both do not harm each other,
then their *virtue/power* (德) returns and exchanges.

The Dao/Way says:
*Dàodé* (道德) is the master of the *Sān Cái* (三才).
*Guǐshén* (鬼神) are the masters of Heaven and Earth.
The Sage is the master of *guǐshén* (鬼神).
*Zhōngfá* (中孚) brings trust even to pigs and fish,
proliferating and flourishing things.

The *dǐng* (鼎) is made of wood,
*Xùn* (巽) and *Huǒ* (火) simmer the cooking.

Governing a great state is like simmering a small fresh delicacy.
Its Dao/Way is *wúwéi* (無為),
its governance is *mènmèn* (昧昧),
its people are *chúnhú* (醇醇);
Its Dao/Way is *yǒuwéi* (有為),
its governance is *cháchà* (察察),
its people are *quēquē* (缺缺).

Thus the Sage measures without severing,
polishes without carving,
straightens without overdoing,
shines without blinding—
to preside over the world with the Dao/Way,
its *guǐshén* (鬼神) cannot become *shén* (神).

All *qìshí* (气时) disasters, epidemics, *kàngyì* (亢沴), and *yāoniè* (妖孽),
are the workings of *guǐshén* (鬼神).
Disasters and demons cannot overcome *shàn dé* (善德),
calamities and chaos cannot overcome *shàn zhèng* (善政),
hence it is said: Using the Dao/Way to preside over Heaven and Earth,
its *guǐshén* (鬼神) are not *shén* (神).」

「Its demons are not *shén* (神) unless they are their own,
and even then, their *shén* (神) cannot harm people.

Their *shén* (神) does not harm people unless it must—
for the Sage’s *shàn dé* (善德) and *shàn zhèng* (善政) do not harm people.
When both sides do not harm each other,
then demons, gods, and the Sage’s *virtue/power* (德)
unite and return to the Dao/Way.

*Virtue/power* (德) says:
The human body encompasses Heaven and Earth, the great state.
The five *zàng* (藏) organs, six *fǔ* (府) organs,
twelve *jīng* (经) meridians and fifteen *luò* (络) networks,
three hundred and sixty bones, joints, and *xué* (穴)/*shù* (俞) points,
eighty-four thousand pores and *cānglì* (腠理) interstices—
blood stretches eight hundred and ten *zhàng* (丈),
*qi* accumulates thirteen thousand five hundred breaths,
a small fresh delicacy indeed.

If one governs the human body,
using the heart as the sovereign to temper *shuǐhuǒ* (水火) with benevolence,
its *qi* harmonizes and returns to the body,
and does not scatter into chaos.

If one governs a great state,
using *yīnyáng* (阴阳) and *shuǐhuǒ* (水火) to temper it with *wúwéi* (無為),
its *virtue/power* (德) harmonizes and returns to the Dao/Way,
and does not descend into harshness and fragmentation.

Thus, under Heaven, the Sage is the sovereign,
and within the body, the heart is the sovereign.
The Sage governs the world with the great Dao/Way,
and its demons are not *shén* (神).
If demons become *shén* (神),
what calamity would not arise?
The great Dao/Way would be lost.

The heart sovereign tempers with true *qi*,
balancing the hundred *mài* (脉) vessels,
and its evils are not *shén* (神).
If evils become *shén* (神),
what illness would not arise?
*Quánzhēn* (全真) would be lost.

From this, it is said:
Its demons are not *shén* (神) unless they must be,
and even then, they cannot harm people—
for the Sage’s governance does not harm people.
The Sage’s governance does not harm people,
so even if demons become *shén* (神),
what further action would they take?
Demons, when they become *shén* (神),
do they truly wish to harm people?
It is only when the Dao/Way is not their own that they disturb it—
a matter of necessity, not choice.

When the Sage’s governance is benevolent,
demons and gods are also benevolent—
this is the mutual non-harm,
hence it is said: *Their virtue/power unites and returns to the Dao/Way.*

**The Great State is the Receptacle of All Currents (Chapter 61)**
The great state is the confluence of all currents,
the meeting place of the world, the feminine of the world.
The feminine ever conquers the masculine by stillness,
and stillness is the feminine’s nature.
Thus, the great state submits to the small state,
and the small state submits to the great state.
So sometimes it submits to take,
sometimes it submits and is taken.

The great state seeks only to shelter and nourish its people,
the small state seeks only to serve and enter into the affairs of others.
Both sides obtain what they desire,
so the great must be the feminine.

The *Classics* say:
The great state is the confluence of currents,
the meeting place of the world, the feminine of the world—
the feminine ever conquers the masculine by stillness,
and stillness is the feminine’s nature.
Thus, the great state submits to the small state,
and the small state submits to the great state.
Sometimes it submits to take—
the great state seeks only to shelter and nourish its people,
as when *Tàiróng* (太王) left *Xián* (邠).
Sometimes it submits and is taken—
the small state seeks only to serve and enter into the affairs of others,
as when *Gōujīn* (句践) served *Wú* (吴).

These are all governed by *zhèng* (正) and tempered by stillness,
submitting without *wéi* (為).
Thus, sometimes it submits to take,
sometimes it submits and is taken.
The great state must be the feminine,
for both sides obtain what they desire—
the small state naturally submits to the great,
so the great must submit to the small.

*Virtue/power* (德) says:
The great state is the great root and vessel.
Returning to the root is stillness,
so stillness is the sovereign of turbulence.
There are Heaven and Earth before there are myriad things,
and myriad things before there are male and female.
Thus, the *xiān* (咸) hexagram’s male and female,
the feminine above and the masculine below,
the two *qi* responding and interacting to restrain each other—
this is why it says: *The male submits to the female.*

Thus, the masculine of the world meets the feminine of the world,
the feminine ever conquers the masculine by stillness,
and stillness is the feminine’s nature.
The great state is the sovereign and ruler,
the small state is the subject and servant.
The sovereign and ruler belong to the male,
the subject and servant belong to the female.
Thus, the *Kūn* (坤) hexagram governs states and cities,
the Earth’s Dao/Way, the wife’s Dao/Way, the subject’s Dao/Way.

If the male submits to the female,
if the great submits to the small,
then Heaven and Earth respond,
and myriad things transform and flourish.
If the female submits to the male,
if the small submits to the great,
then the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is followed,
enduring forever without ceasing.
This is called governing with *zhèng* (正).

The female may guard stillness,
the male may submit to take her—
he seeks only to shelter and nourish her.
The male may guard stillness,
the female may submit to take him—
she seeks only to draw near and serve him.
This is called employing *qí* (奇) in warfare.

Both sides obtain what they desire—
the female naturally belongs below,
so the male must submit to her.

**The Dao/Way is the Essence of All Things (Chapter 62)**
The Dao/Way is the essence of all things,
a treasure for the virtuous,
a safeguard for the unvirtuous.
Fine words can be sold,
and noble conduct can be bestowed upon others.
What is there to discard in people who are not virtuous?
They are the very ones who need the Dao/Way’s protection.»

Thus, when establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Ministers, even if one were offered a *gǒngbì* (arc-shaped jade tablet) and four-horse chariot as precedence, it would not compare to sitting and receiving this Dao/Way.

Why did the ancients hold this Dao/Way in such esteem? Was it not because it grants what one seeks and pardons transgressions? Therefore, it is the most precious for all under Heaven.

The Classic states:
*The Dao/Way is the essence of all things,
the treasure of the virtuous,
the refuge of the unvirtuous.*
Fine words can be sold at a fair price,
and noble conduct can be bestowed upon others.
What is there to discard in those who are unvirtuous?
Already possessing teachers and noble conduct,
what is there to discard?

Thus, when establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Ministers, even if one were offered the *gǒngbì* and the finest treasures, or precedence in a four-horse chariot, it would not compare to sitting and receiving this Dao/Way. Indeed, this Dao/Way is more precious than the *gǒngbì* and surpasses even the four-horse chariot.

Why did the ancients hold this Dao/Way in such esteem? Do not suppose it is merely a means to gain what one seeks or to avoid punishment—therefore, it is the most precious for all under Heaven.

The *De* (德) declares:
*The Dao/Way is the essence of all things,
the most profound mystery of the world.*
Formless yet manifest, without substance yet bearing likeness,
it arises from the Supreme Polarity’s luminous void.
Before Heaven’s breath coalesces into a single grain,
great as millet—named *jīnjīng* (金晶, Golden Crystal),
also called *zhēnqiān* (真铅, True Lead),
*yángdān* (阳丹, Solar Elixir),
or *Tiānyī* (天一, Heaven-One)—
the treasure of the virtuous.
Though it is the treasure of the virtuous,
it is also the refuge of the unvirtuous.
If one encounters a Sage of the highest order,
what heights cannot be attained?

**Chapter 63: *For Non-Action***

To act in *non-action*,
to govern in *non-governance*,
to savor in *non-savor*—
great or small, much or little,
repay enmity with *virtue/power*.

Plan for difficulty when it is still easy,
achieve the great by beginning with the small.
The world’s difficult tasks must begin in ease,
the world’s great deeds must arise from the minute.
Thus, the Sage never acts in grandeur,
and so achieves true grandeur.

He who lightly promises will seldom keep faith,
he who takes many things lightly will meet many difficulties.
Therefore, the Sage still regards them as difficult,
and so remains without difficulty.

The *Classical Text* declares:
To act in *non-action*,
to govern in *non-governance*,
to savor in *non-savor*.
To attain the great from the small,
to accumulate much from little—
all stem from repaying enmity with *virtue/power*.
Thus, plan for difficulty when it is still easy,
achieve the great by beginning with the small.
For the world’s difficult tasks must begin in ease,
the world’s great deeds must arise from the minute.
Thus, the Sage achieves grandeur by beginning with the small,
never acting in grandeur itself,
and so achieves true grandeur.
Because he regards difficulty as difficulty,
he remains without difficulty.

What does this mean?
He who lightly promises will seldom keep faith,
he who takes many things lightly will meet many difficulties.

The *De* (德) states:
*Non-action* as the foundation of action,
calm conquers agitation.
*Non-governance* as the foundation of governance,
emptiness conquers fullness.
*Non-savor* as the foundation of savor,
simplicity conquers brilliance.

In cultivating the self and nurturing life,
the first essential is a firm and subtle foundation.
A firm and subtle foundation must begin with refining the elixir.
The proverb says:
*"Wealth comes from careful saving,
poverty from failing to compete."*
Do not dismiss good deeds as too small to perform,
nor indulge in evil as too trivial to avoid.
Drips of water, unceasing, become rivers.
The high rests upon the low as its base,
the noble upon the humble as its root—
thus, one repays enmity with *virtue/power*.

Therefore, plan for difficulty when it is still easy,
achieve the great by beginning with the small.
For the world’s difficult tasks must begin in ease,
the world’s great deeds must arise from the minute.
Thus, the Sage fears not attaining grandeur,
never acting in grandeur itself,
and so achieves true grandeur;
fears not facing difficulty,
still regarding it as difficult,
and so remains without difficulty.
To speak of grandeur before attaining it is to lightly promise—
seldom will faith be kept.
To speak of difficulty before overcoming it is to take things lightly—
many difficulties will arise.

**Chapter 64: *Its Ease in Holding***

Its ease lies in being held firm,
its unseen signs are best planned early,
its fragility makes it easy to shatter,
its subtlety disperses with neglect—
act before it manifests,
govern before disorder arises.

A tree thick enough to embrace grows from a slender sprout;
a nine-tiered tower begins with a single clod of earth;
a thousand-li journey starts beneath one’s feet.
To act when it already exists is to court failure,
to grasp when already disordered is to ensure loss.
Thus, the Sage acts in *non-action* and knows no failure,
holds nothing and knows no loss.
Men, in their undertakings, often ruin what is nearly complete.
To finish with the same care as the beginning,
then no task will fail.

Therefore, the Sage desires what others do not,
values not the hard-to-obtain treasures;
learns what others do not learn,
undoes the errors of the multitude,
ever aiding the natural course of all things,
daring not to act.

The *Classical Text* declares:
Its ease lies in being held firm,
its unseen signs are best planned early,
its fragility makes it easy to shatter,
its subtlety disperses with neglect—
thus, act before it manifests,
govern before disorder arises.
For a tree thick enough to embrace grows from a slender sprout;
a nine-tiered tower begins with a single clod of earth;
a thousand-li journey starts beneath one’s feet.
To act when it already exists is to court failure,
to grasp disorder and attempt governance is to ensure loss.
The Sage acts in *non-action* and knows no failure,
holds nothing and knows no loss.
Men, in their undertakings, often falter in their resolve,
and so complete what they ruin.
To finish with the same care as the beginning,
then no task will fail.

Therefore, the Sage desires what others do not desire,
so he does not value hard-to-obtain treasures;
learns what others do not learn,
undoes the errors of the multitude,
ever aiding the natural course of all things,
daring not to act.

The *Dao* declares:
That which is stable is easy to hold,
that which is yet unmanifest is best planned early,
that which is fragile is easy to break,
that which is subtle is easy to disperse—
all must be acted upon before they exist,
governed before they become disordered.

That which is not yet perilous is the Sage who rests secure in his station.
That which is not yet lost is the Sage who preserves what remains.
That which is not yet disordered is the Sage who governs its emergence.

Thus, the virtuous man remains secure yet never forgets danger,
preserves existence yet never forgets loss,
governs yet never forgets chaos—
so his person is secure while his state may be preserved.

The *Classic of Changes* declares:
*"Its loss, its loss—
bound to the mulberry and hemp."*

Thus, the tree that spans a man’s embrace begins as a tiny sprout;
the nine-tiered tower rises from a single clod of earth;
the thousand-li journey commences beneath one’s feet—
these are the inevitable *Dao* of things.

One cannot leap over stages to accomplish them,
nor build upon empty foundations to grasp them—
to act thus is to court ruin,
to hold thus is to invite loss.

The Sage acts in *non-action*, yet progress is truly made,
so he knows no failure.
The Sage does not grasp, yet each step is truly taken,
so he knows no loss.

But men’s undertakings differ from this:
they do not labor for true advancement,
yet often falter in their resolve;
they do not walk the path with genuine steps,
yet often stumble in their deeds—
though they begin, they ruin what they complete.
For completion lies in resolve, yet ruin comes in action;
action, when true, knows no ruin.

Therefore, to finish with the same care as the beginning,
to walk with steady feet upon the earth,
then no task will fail.

All men desire hard-to-obtain treasures,
yet the Sage desires not what they desire—
so he does not value their treasures.

All men learn what others have already erred in,
yet the Sage does not learn what they learn—
so he can undo their mistakes,
aiding the natural course of all things
yet daring not to act presumptuously in affairs.

The *virtue* declares:
Man’s primordial *qi*, each has one *jin*.
At birth, one *jin* of *qi* is but one *dan* in weight.
In one year, the twenty-four *qi* produce one *liang*,
and by sixteen years, one *jin* is fully formed.
After three years past this, one *liang* is consumed,
and by sixty-four years, one *jin* is utterly exhausted.
Thus, the eighty-eight *guà* of a man’s life span,
his primordial *qi* is spent.

When primordial *qi* is stable and secure,
it is very easy to hold firm against peril;
when primordial *qi* is faint and unclear,
it is very easy to plan its early signs;
when primordial *qi* is soft and fragile,
it is very easy to shatter its hardness;
when primordial *qi* is subtle and refined,
it is very easy to disperse its lodging.

To act before things arise,
then there is no need for action;
to govern before things become disordered,
then there is no need for governance.

The tree that spans a man’s embrace begins as a tiny sprout—
this is the *yang* spirit’s interaction with the *qi*.
The nine-tiered tower rises from a single clod of earth—
this is the *golden elixir*’s refinement in the *jing*.
The thousand-li journey commences beneath one’s feet—
this is the *valley spirit*’s reliance on the *dark mother*.

Each step must be firmly trodden,
no shortcuts allowed.
To act by shortcuts is to court ruin,
to grasp by artifice is to invite loss.

The Sage acts in *non-action* yet does nothing without effect,
so he knows no failure.
He does not grasp yet does nothing without holding,
so he knows no loss.

But men’s ways in these matters are otherwise:
they do not know the great *Dao* of *non-action*,
spitting out the old and taking in the new,
seeking solitude and stillness,
long in the use of resolve yet short in the use of action—
sometimes open, sometimes blocked,
half secure, half perilous,
with occasional small successes,
yet ruined at the turn of a hand.
How could they exhaust the principles and reach the essence,
thus attaining the *Way* of life?

Only by grasping the primordial *non-action* of the *Dao*,
remaining steadfast from beginning to end,
then no task will fail.

The Sage does not desire what men desire—
so he does not value hard-to-obtain treasures;
he does not learn what men learn—
so he can undo the multitude’s errors,
aiding the natural course of all things
yet daring not to act presumptuously.

The *Classic* of the ancient Sage who practiced the *Dao* (Chapter Sixty-Five):
The ancient Sage who practiced the *Dao*
did not seek to enlighten the people,
but rather to keep them in simplicity.
The people are hard to govern,
because their cleverness is too great.

Thus, to govern the state with cleverness is to be its thief;
to govern the state without cleverness is to be its blessing.
These two are the people’s models.

To always know these models,
this is called *mysterious virtue*.
The *mysterious virtue* is profound and distant,
contrary to the ways of things—
then only does it reach the great harmony.

The text declares:
The ancient Sage who practiced the *Dao*
did not seek to make the people use its wisdom,
but rather to make them use its simplicity.
The people are hard to govern,
because their cleverness is too great.
Thus, to govern the state with cleverness is to be its thief;
to govern the state without cleverness is to be its blessing.
These two are the people’s models.

To always know these models,
this is called *mysterious virtue*.
The *mysterious virtue* is profound and distant,
contrary to the ways of things—
then only does it reach the great harmony.

The *Dao* declares:
The people can be made to follow,
but cannot be made to understand.
There are those who govern others,
and those who are governed by others—
thus the people can be led to joyful success,
but cannot be made to share in planning its beginnings.

If the people are made to understand,
it is like commanding them to build a house on the highway—
three years, yet it will never be finished.
Thus, the ancient Sage who practiced the *Dao*
did not seek to make the people use the *Dao*’s wisdom,
but rather to make them use the *Dao*’s simplicity.

To use the *Dao*’s wisdom is the way of the Sage—
without the virtuous, none can govern the common folk.
To use the *Dao*’s simplicity is the way of the common folk—
without the common folk, none can nurture the Sage.

If the people use the *Dao*’s wisdom,
they will vie for cleverness and craftiness,
their hearts laboring while their days grow ever more incompetent.
If the people use the *Dao*’s simplicity,
they will return to purity and revert to simplicity,
their hearts at ease while their days grow ever more restful.

When the common folk use the *Dao* yet do not know it,
the *Dao* of the virtuous is still rare—
how much more so the *Dao* of the Sage?

This is *non-action* yet nothing is left undone.
The foolish, in the *Dao*’s simplicity;
the wise, in the *Dao*’s wisdom—
not to deliberately make the people wise or foolish,
but rather to make them use wisdom and simplicity,
this is the Sage’s artful balance.

The people are hard to govern,
because their cleverness is too great—
to use the *Dao*’s wisdom is to govern with cleverness,
thus to be the state’s thief.
The people are easy to govern,
not because they are simple—
to use the *Dao*’s simplicity is to govern without cleverness,
thus to be the state’s blessing.

To always know these models,
this is called *mysterious virtue*—
the people’s standard of excellence.
To always adhere to these models,
this is called *mysterious virtue*.

The **mysterious virtue** of Heaven is profound and distant,
thus it turns contrary to all things.
Hence it is easily inverted by calculation—
Heaven’s body revolves westward,
while the sun, moon, and five stars move eastward.

Heaven is high in the southeast,
the Earth is high in the northwest,
the Earth is low in the southeast,
Heaven’s *qi* descends,
Earth’s *qi* ascends—
all contrary to things.

When its work is complete,
then it is unified—
thus the *Dao* of Heaven, Earth, and the Sage
does not oppose all ten thousand things,
or else they could not succeed in the world.
Hence it is said: **Only then does it reach the Great Harmony.**

**Virtue** is spoken of:
The *Dao* is the primordial Way of Heaven.
The *Dao* is the sovereign of the human heart,
the divine master of true *qi*.
The people are the five *zàng* organs, six *fǔ* viscera, and twelve *guī* palaces.

The ancients who excelled in cultivating life and nurturing the essence
did not treat the twelve *guī* palaces as clever,
nor did they treat them as simple—
but rather, they made the heart and spirit their master.

If each palace were allowed to govern its own affairs,
then the body would first fall ill—
how could one then nurture the essence?

Thus the people are hard to govern,
because their cleverness is too great—
too much cleverness means they must be governed by cleverness,
not by the Way of non-action.
Hence to govern with cleverness is the state’s thief,
while to govern without cleverness is the state’s blessing.

To know these two models of governing the body and the people,
this is the standard of excellence for life and essence.
To always know the *Dao* of these models,
this is called **mysterious virtue**.

**Mysterious virtue** is profound and distant—
the *Dao* of Heaven, Earth, humanity, and all things’ creation.
All contrary to things,
yet it reaches the Great Harmony without confusion.

The rivers and seas are the sovereigns of all valleys—
Chapter Sixty-Six
The reason the rivers and seas can be sovereigns of all valleys
is that they excel in descending—
thus they can be sovereigns of all valleys.

Therefore, the Sage who wishes to rule above others
speaks with humility below;
who wishes to lead others
places himself behind them.

The Sage thus stands above yet people do not feel burdened,
leads yet people do not feel oppressed—
therefore the world gladly follows and never tires.

Because he does not contend,
none under Heaven can contend with him.

The *Classics* say:
*"The rivers and seas can be sovereigns of all valleys
because they excel in descending—
thus they can be sovereigns of all valleys."*

Therefore, the Sage who seeks to rise above others
must speak with humility below;
who seeks to lead others
must place himself behind them.

Thus the Sage stands above yet people do not deem him heavy,
leads yet people do not deem him harmful—
therefore the world gladly follows and never tires.
Because he does not contend,
none under Heaven can contend with him.

The *Dao* states:
*"Great states are like the lower reaches of rivers—
the rivers and seas can be sovereigns of all valleys
because they excel in descending—
thus they can be sovereigns of all valleys,
mirroring the Earth’s yielding nature (坤之象).*

Though the seas may number four,
the eastern and southern are the largest,
for their nature is to descend.
Thus the tides’ reliability,
even as they travel west beyond a thousand *li* to reach Luoyang,
nearly reaching the center of the Earth.
The reason the island peoples of the eastern and southern seas suffer most from flooding
is that they are near the rivers’ lower reaches—
so it is known that the rivers and seas can be sovereigns of all valleys
only because they descend in their earthly form.

The Sage thus can be above all the myriad people
only because he descends through his words;
his body can lead all the myriad people
only because he places himself behind them."

Thus, by honoring what is low and disregarding what is high, one gains the people’s allegiance.
By speaking before the people, they forget their toil;
by leading them into danger, they forget their fear of death.
By placing themselves behind, they come first;
by abandoning themselves, they are preserved.

Therefore, the Sage stands above the myriad people,
yet they are revered without burden;
he moves before the myriad people,
yet they follow without resistance.

Thus, the world willingly promotes him without tiring,
for he does not contend with the people.

Only he who does not contend
can ensure none contend with him.

**Virtue/Power says:**
The *dantian* and *qihai* are where the *gushen* true-qi converges.
Because they excel in descending,
they receive the homage of all rivers and streams,
able to be sovereigns of the valleys,
nourishing the roots of Heaven and Earth.

Thus, the heart-spirit, adorned above the Five Phases,
must descend through true-qi;
to surpass the Five Phases’ order,
one must yield to blood-qi.

Therefore, the heart-sovereign, named above the Five Phases,
is revered without burden;
the spirit, placed before the Five Phases,
is followed without resistance.

Thus, the four limbs, six pulses, myriad transformations, and hundred bones
willingly promote it without tiring,
for the heart-spirit acts without striving
and does not contend with the Five Phases for precedence.

If there is contention,
then bitterness and suffering do not cease,
acrid and pungent do not harmonize,
serene and bland do not communicate,
emptiness and nothingness do not intermingle,
true-qi does not follow,
spirit does not abide,
and diseases arise—
how can this be called the Way?

Only when the heart-sovereign does not contend
can the Five Phases not contend with it.
Great indeed are these words!

The world says my Way is great, yet seems unworthy.
Only because it is great does it seem unworthy.
If it seemed worthy for long, it would be trifling indeed.

I possess three treasures; I hold them dear.
First: compassion,
Second: frugality,
Third: not daring to act first under Heaven.

Compassion makes one courageous;
frugality makes one expansive;
not daring to act first under Heaven makes one the vessel’s leader.

Now, abandoning compassion and courage,
abandoning frugality and expansiveness,
abandoning humility and precedence—
this is death.

Compassion, when used in war, brings victory;
when used in defense, brings security.
If Heaven intends to save this person,
it will first shield them with compassion,
restrain them with frugality,
and weaken them by not daring to act first under Heaven—
only then can they become the leader of the sacred vessel.

**Virtue/Power says:**
The world says I have attained the great Way,
yet seem unworthy of it.
Because the Way is great, it seems unworthy.
If greatness seemed worthy for long,
it would be the speech of the vulgar, not the enlightened.

The Way fills all under Heaven, permeating all things—
how can there be worthy or unworthy in greatness?

Zhongyong says:
*"Each person has the elixir of longevity,
yet fools discard it in their confusion."*
And again:
*"This supreme treasure is in every home,
yet fools fail to recognize it fully."*

Is it only that the great is the Way?
Thus it is said: I have three treasures; people should cherish and hold them.
First: compassion—no cruelty,
compassion without cruelty makes one courageous.
Second: frugality—no greed,
frugality without greed makes one expansive.
Third: not daring to act first under Heaven—no aggression,
preceding without aggression makes one the vessel’s leader.

Not daring to be the world’s courageous one,
thus one fulfills compassion’s leadership;
not daring to be the world’s expansive one,
thus one fulfills frugality’s leadership;
not daring to act first under Heaven,
thus one fulfills the vessel’s leadership.

Fine weapons are inauspicious instruments;
used only when unavoidable, serenity is supreme.
To win in battle and rejoice is to delight in killing.
Those who delight in killing must be killed—
thus they cannot achieve their desires under Heaven.

Now, abandoning compassion and courage,
and instead indulging in cruelty—

Abandoning frugality yet seeking expansion,
and instead indulging in greed—
abandoning humility yet acting first,
and instead indulging in aggression—
their swift death is certain.

This is the ignorance of compassion,
the foundation of defense and war.
To wage war with compassion,
the world submits to you;
to wage war with cruelty,
your kin betray you.
With what the world submits to,
attack what your kin betray—
thus the virtuous warrior
has no need to fight,
yet when he fights, he is certain to win.

To defend the realm with compassion,
the world aids you;
to defend the realm with greed,
the world despises you.
With what the world aids you in,
defend against what the world despises—
thus the virtuous warrior
has no need to defend,
yet when he defends, he is unshakable.

Therefore, when Heaven intends to bestow the Great Dao
to save this person,
it must make him wield compassion
as his unbreakable armor and sharpest weapon.

**Chapter 68: The Virtuous Warrior**

The virtuous warrior is not aggressive,
the skilled fighter does not rage,
the master of victory does not engage,
the adept at using men places himself below them.

This is called the virtue of non-contention,
this is called the power of using men,
this is called aligning with Heaven’s ancient extremes.

The Classic says:
The virtuous warrior is not aggressive,
the skilled fighter does not rage,
the master of victory does not engage in battle,
the adept at using men first places himself below them.

This is called the virtue of non-contention,
this is called the power of using men,
this is called aligning with Heaven’s ancient extremes.

The Way says:
King Wu crossed the孟津 river,
and the lords of the eight hundred states gathered without summons.
King Wu said: *"It is not yet time."*

After two years, he extinguished Zhou,
and this is called the virtuous warrior not being aggressive.

At the hour of甲子, dawn breaking,
the king arrived at the outskirts of Shang,
and there he swore his oath.
The king held the yellow axe in his left hand,
grasped the white banner in his right,
and waved them—
this is called the skilled fighter not raging.

The enemy’s troops were arrayed like forests,
yet none dared oppose our army.
The vanguard turned their spears and struck from behind,
driving them north.
Blood flowed, staining the battle-axes red,
and the world was at peace—
this is called the master of victory not engaging.

The enemy had countless millions,
their hearts and virtues divided,
while we had but three thousand warriors,
our hearts and virtues united.
Even great states feared our strength,
small states cherished our virtue—
this is called the adept at using men placing himself below them.

Thus King Wu—
this is called the virtue of non-contention,
this is called the power of using men,
this is called aligning with Heaven to set the ancient extremes.

The Virtue says:
The world’s exchange,
the world’s female—
ever with stillness overcoming the male,
ever with stillness placing itself below.

Thus, when yin is above,
yang flees beneath,
the head and tail are aggressive,
the center is refined.
This is knowing that the adept at refining fire
is not solely for aggression—
thus the adept at the Great Dao
is not aggressive yet is aggressive,
not refined yet is refined—
hence, the virtuous warrior is not aggressive.

Strong arms and battlefield victories are still inauspicious—
how much more so when raging in battle?
Thus the skilled fighter does not rage,
subduing the enemy without striking.

The sage’s gaze meets the Dao’s presence,
spirit encountering spirit—
even when tortoises gaze at each other,
cranes call to cranes,
they still meet spirit with spirit—
how much more so for the master of victory?
Thus he does not engage in battle.
The adept at using men places himself below.

The world’s ultimate softness
gallops across the world’s ultimate firmness—
this is called the virtue of non-contention.
Because he does not contend,
none under Heaven can contend with him—
this is called the power of using men.
Give the people what they desire,
remove what they hate—
those who walk this Way
are called aligning with Heaven since ancient times without parallel.

**Chapter 69: The Art of War’s Speeches**

The art of war has this saying:
*"I dare not be the aggressor but only the defender,
I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot."*

This is called moving without moving,
pushing without arms,
advancing without resistance,
seizing without weapons.

No greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—
underestimating the enemy risks losing our treasure.
Thus when armies clash,
the compassionate one wins.

The Classic says:
The art of war has this saying:
*"I dare not be the aggressor but am always the defender,
I dare not advance an inch but always retreat a foot."*

This is called moving as if not moving,
pushing as if without arms,
advancing as if without resistance,
seizing as if without weapons.
No greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—
underestimating the enemy risks losing our treasure—
thus when armies clash,
the first to show compassion wins.

The Way says:
The military has this saying:
*"Do not dare to be the aggressor—
the army marches by discipline,
losing discipline brings disaster—
yet always be the defender—
this is called the power of using men,
thus one does not dare to be the aggressor but is always the defender."*

Three parts of Shang’s realm
were already held by King Wen,
yet he still served Shang.
For nine years, his great merit was not yet fulfilled,
until King Wu and the Duke of Zhou succeeded him—
this is called not daring to advance an inch but always retreating a foot.

The revolution of Tang and Wu
followed Heaven’s will and responded to the people.
The east was pacified, the west lamented.
*"Our lord has gone—
may those who come after him revive him!"*
The people he left behind
rejoiced in their homes—
this is called moving without moving,
pushing without arms,
advancing without resistance,
seizing without weapons.

The Minor Teacher said:
*"Not opposing the king is not an enemy."*
When Chu defeated him,
this is why he was annihilated at 随.

No greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—
underestimating the enemy risks losing our treasure.
When Wu and Yue clashed in battle,
Yue, unable to resist, begged for submission,
and Wu released them—
later, they were destroyed by Goujian.
Thus it is said:
when armies clash,
the compassionate one wins.

The Virtue says:
Purple Yang says:
*"A pound of medicine requires sixteen ounces,
adjusting the fire’s timing with yin and yang."*

Nurturing medicine requires fire’s timing,
and timing must be balanced between yin and yang.
Fire’s timing has refinement and aggression,
has guest and host—
this is the law of war.

Again it says:
*"Using generals, divide into left and right armies—
let them be the host, I the guest.
I urge you: on the battlefield, do not underestimate the enemy,
lest you lose your family’s priceless treasure."*

This is precisely what is meant.

In general, the **Way of wielding armies**,
**cowardice** is the master—
cowardice means one does not dare to underestimate the enemy,
thus one always awaits the weary with ease,
dulls the sharp with the blunt,
awaits the moving with stillness,
and governs the martial with the refined.
Hence, through strategic maneuvering and negotiations,
one can bend the enemy’s strength **without battle**.

Those who wield armies say:
*"I dare not be the host but only the guest,*
and *"I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot."*
This is called **acting where there is no action**,
**resisting where there is no arm**,
**persisting where there is no enemy**,
and **grasping where there are no troops**.
Thus, the greatest calamity is underestimating the enemy—
underestimating the enemy risks losing our treasure.

Purple Yang further says:
*"Before the first string, after the first string, before the first string—
the flavors blend evenly, the qi fully manifests."*

When the herbs are gathered and placed in the furnace to calcine,
calcined and then tempered through warm nurturing and simmering,
the finest medicines—**cinnabar and mercury**—
are nothing but these two substances in their raw form.
When combined and calcined,
their mastery depends entirely on **fire’s timing**,
adding or subtracting as needed.
Too refined, they fail to mature;
too aggressive, they dissipate.
Thus, one must not dare to underestimate **fire’s timing**,
lest one risk losing our treasure.

**Refinement and aggression must complement each other**,
**rigor and yielding must alternate**—
only through careful balance can one achieve the desired effect.
Hence, when armies clash,
the compassionate one wins.

In stalemate, where strength and resolve are matched,
if one acts presumptuously, defeat is certain.
If pressed to act,
one may use humble words to evoke **compassion**,
and gentle demeanor to provoke **arrogance**,
letting the enemy indulge their ambitions
before achieving self-victory.

My words are **very easy to know, very easy to act upon**,
yet none under heaven can know them,
none can act upon them.
Words have a **foundation**,
affairs have a **lord**.
It is only because of the world’s **lack of knowing**,
that none knows me.
Few know me—
thus I am **noble**.
Hence, the **Sage wears coarse robes while holding precious jade**.

The **Scripture** says:
*"My words are very easy to know,
very easy to act upon.
Because they are the most easy,
none under heaven can know them,
none can act upon them.
Their words have a foundation,
their affairs have a lord.
It is only because of the world’s lack of knowing,
that none knows me.
Thus, few know me—
I am noble.
Hence, the Sage wears coarse robes while holding precious jade,
yet none knows him."*

The **Dao** says:
*"The Dao is near yet men seek it afar,
affairs are easy yet men seek them with difficulty.
All things under heaven are born from the Dao—
none can be separated or chosen.
Very easy to know,
very easy to act upon—
the Dao is near, affairs are easy.
Yet none under heaven can know it,
none can act upon it—
they seek it afar, they seek it with difficulty.
The world has long called me great,
yet my subtlety is profound.

If speaking of **Heaven and Earth**,
one must begin with **Taiji**;
if speaking of **all things**,
one must begin with **Heaven and Earth**;
if speaking of **male and female**,
one must begin with **father and mother**.
Thus, words have a foundation,
affairs have a lord.
It is only because of this **lack of knowing**,
that none can truly know me.
Now that none can know me,
few know me—
thus I know my own **nobility**.
Hence, the Sage wears coarse robes while holding precious jade—
who can know him?"*

The **Virtue** says:
Purple Yang says:
*"Common speech and vulgar sayings align with the **Sage’s Dao**,
yet one must carefully investigate within them.
If one seeks to invert daily usage,
even the dust of the earth becomes treasure.
My words are very easy to know,
very easy to act upon.
Yet when asked their meaning,
none under heaven can know them,
none can act upon them—
why is this so?
Their words have a foundation,
their affairs have a lord.
Their words have a foundation—
they do not depart from **Taiji, the Two Qi (Yin-Yang), the Four Symbols, the Eight Trigrams**;
their affairs have a lord—
they do not depart from **Heaven and Earth, the Sun and Moon, male and female, water and fire**.
Applied to **Heaven and Earth**,
all things naturally arise and flourish—
very easy to know,
very easy to act upon.
Transferred to the **human body**,
the **heart and kidneys** naturally embody **water and fire**—
yet none under heaven can know them,
none can act upon them.
It is only because of the world’s **lack of knowing**,
that none can truly know me.
Few know me—
thus I know my **Dao’s nobility**.
Hence, the Sage wears coarse robes while holding precious jade—
who can know him?"*

「Thus, the Sage despises coarse attire,
yet cherishes **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**—
hence the saying: *"Wearing coarse robes while holding precious jade."*
The common folk observe his exterior,
yet fail to perceive his interior—
how then can they know the Sage’s **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**?

**Chapter Seventy-One: Knowing the Unknown**
To know the unknown—this is **nobility**;
to claim to know what is unknown—this is **illness**.
Only by **illness** of the **illness**,
is it that one does not fall **ill**.
The Sage does not fall **ill**,
because he **illnesses** the **illness**,
and thus does not fall **ill**.
The **Sutra** says:
*"To know as unknown is **nobility**;
to claim to know what is unknown is **illness**.*
Only by **illnessing** his **illness**,
is it that one does not fall **ill**.
The Sage does not fall **ill**,
because he **illnesses** the **illness**,
and thus does not fall **ill**.
The **Dao** says:
*"To know what one knows as known,
and to know what one does not know as unknown—
this is true knowing.*
Thus, the true **knower** does not speak;
the speaker does not truly **know**.
Yet the Sage’s **Dao**—
books cannot exhaust his words,
words cannot exhaust his meaning.
Like a pearl rolling through a jade tray,
it meets **origin/root** on all sides,
and there is no path it cannot take.
For his **Great Dao** is originally without words or speech,
all is **wuwei** and natural.
Even to know as unknown is still not true knowing—
how much more so to claim to know what is unknown?
Thus, the true **knower** does not consider himself as **knowing**—
this is **nobility**;
the false **knower** forcefully claims **knowing**—
this is **illness**.
Those who can **illness** the **illness** of claiming to know what is unknown as their own **illness**,
and thus do not fall **ill**.
Why does the Sage not fall **ill**?
It is because he can **illness** his **illness**,
and thus is not afflicted by the Sage’s **illness**.
**Virtue/Power** says:
*"My words are very easy to know,
very easy to act upon—
to know the unknown is **nobility**.
All under Heaven cannot act upon it,
to claim to know what is unknown is **illness**.
Thus, the Sage’s governance—
empties the mind,
fills the belly,
weakens the will,
strengthens the bones,
and makes the people without knowledge or desire.
To know the unknown is **nobility**—
this was the **Dao/Way** of the ancient scholars.
The self-perceived are not enlightened,
the self-righteous do not shine forth,
excess food and redundant actions—
others may detest them.
To claim to know what is unknown is **illness**—
this is the **Dao/Way** of today’s scholars.
Those who can **illness** their **illness**,
and thus do not fall **ill**;
those who cannot **illness** their **illness**,
and thus become **ill**.
The Sage does not fall **ill**,
because he **illnesses** the **illness**,
and can **illness** his **illness**,
and thus does not fall **ill**.*

**Chapter Seventy-Two: The People Do Not Fear the Way’s威威**
The people do not fear the **威威**,
yet the **Great威威** has truly arrived.
Do not narrow their dwelling,
do not sicken of their birth.
Only by not sicken,
is it that one does not sicken.
Thus, the Sage knows himself without revealing himself,
loves himself without esteeming himself—
hence he discards that and takes this.
The **Sutra** says:
*"The people do not fear the **威威**,
yet the **Great威威** has truly arrived.
Do not narrow their dwelling by oneself,
do not sicken of their birth by oneself.
Only by not sicken of their birth,
is it that one is always not sickened.
Thus, the Sage knows himself without revealing himself,
loves himself without esteeming himself—
hence he discards that narrowness and sickness,
takes this knowing and loving.*
The **Dao** says:
*"Heaven is wise and clear,
I make the people wise and clear.
Heaven’s **威威** is manifest,
I make the people’s **威威** manifest and thus fear it.
Heaven aids the lower people,
making them lords, making them teachers.*
Thus, the people do not fear the **威威**,
yet the **Great威威** has truly arrived.
In his conduct as a man,
he dwells in the broadest place under Heaven,
stands in the most upright position under Heaven,
walks the **Great Dao** of Heaven,
when he achieves his aims, he follows the people’s desires,
when he does not achieve his aims, he perfects himself alone—
this is enough, this is what a **Great Man** does.
To love them is to wish them to live,
to narrow their dwelling by oneself.
To hate them is to wish them to die,
to sicken of their birth by oneself.
How shallow the **Great Man**!
Thus it is said:
*"Do not narrow their dwelling—
this is the **Dao/Way** of knowing oneself.
Do not sicken of their birth—
this is the **Dao/Way** of loving oneself.*
Only by not sicken of their birth,
is it that one is always not sickened.
Thus, the Sage knows himself without revealing himself,
loves himself without esteeming himself.
**Dao/Way** requires knowing oneself,
and clarity without revealing oneself;
**virtue/power** requires loving oneself,
and fame without esteeming oneself.
If the **Great Dao** is truly known,
who cannot see his clarity?
Why must he reveal himself?
If **Great virtue/power** is truly loved,
who cannot esteem his name?
Why must he esteem himself?
If clarity is revealed by oneself,
this is narrowing their dwelling.
If fame is esteemed by oneself,
this is sicken of their birth.
Is this not confusion?
Thus, the Sage discards that narrowness,
takes this knowing;
discards that sickness,
takes this loving.
**Virtue/Power** says:
*"What the people fear,
one cannot but fear.
The **法** is like a river or stream,
making the people easy to avoid.
I have seen those who tread in water and fire and die—
can one not fear?
If the people do not fear the **威威** of water and fire,
then the **Great威威** of water and fire has truly arrived.
If they fear its **威威**,
water and fire are daily used,
drinking and eating nourish the people.
If they do not fear the **威威**,
leaning on rivers, crossing streams,
rushing into boiling water, treading in fire—
there is nothing they will not reach.
I have seen those who die from this,
thus it is said: the **Great威威** has truly arrived.
The people do not fear the **威威**—
this is narrowing their dwelling.
The **Great威威** has truly arrived—
this is sicken of their birth.
Do not narrow their dwelling,
and make the people fear the **威威**.
Do not sicken of their birth,
and make the **Great威威** not arrive.
Thus it is said:
*"Only by not sicken,
is it that one does not sicken."*
Daily drinking and eating—
how could there be sickness?
Thus, the Sage always knows his own deficiencies,
does not reveal his clarity’s excess,
always loves his own entry into the **Dao**,
does not esteem his name’s surpassing others—
hence it is said: discard that and take this.*

**Chapter Seventy-Three: Boldness in Daring**
Boldness in daring leads to death,
boldness in not daring leads to life.
These two may bring benefit or harm—
what does Heaven detest?
Who knows its reason?
Thus, the Sage finds it difficult.
The **Dao** of Heaven,
does not contend yet naturally triumphs,
does not speak yet naturally responds,
does not summon yet they come on their own,
plain and unadorned yet naturally well-planned.
Heaven’s net is vast and wide,
rarely missing yet not confining.»

「The Classic states: Boldness in daring will meet death,
boldness in not daring will live.
Understanding these two,
benefit and harm are clearly known.
What Heaven abhors,
who knows its reason?
Thus, the Sage still finds it difficult to know.

For indeed, the **Dao** of Heaven,
does not contend yet naturally triumphs,
does not speak yet naturally responds,
does not summon yet they come on their own,
plain and clear, yet well-planned.
Hence, Heaven’s net is vast and wide,
rarely missing yet not confining.

The **Dao** says: Out of compassion, one can be bold,
but daring leads to killing others.
If one dares to kill others,
others will surely kill in return—
hence it is said: boldness in daring will meet death.

The greatest boldness in governing the world,
dwells in the greatest stillness,
using softness to overcome hardness,
using stillness to conquer heat—
boldness in not daring leads to life.

In general, these two bring either benefit or harm,
and all know this.
What Heaven abhors,
who knows its reason?
Thus, the Sage still finds it difficult to know its reason.

The essence of Heaven’s abhorrence:
those who dare and meet death—
those who act and love contention,
those who speak without knowing,
those who exalt differences and lack planning—
these are what Heaven abhors.
Hence, the **Dao** of Heaven,
does not contend yet naturally triumphs.

Earth has nurturing, growth, harvest, and concealment,
thick **virtue** bearing all things,
does not speak yet naturally responds.

Humans have benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom,
great undertakings completing all things,
do not summon yet they come on their own.

This is called the **Dao** of Heaven,
plain and clear, yet well-planned.

Heaven and Earth establish their positions,
the Sage perfects their abilities—
human scheming, ghostly scheming,
all share in their functions.
Thus, those who naturally triumph do not contend,
those who naturally respond do not speak,
those who come on their own are not summoned,
those who are well-planned are plain and clear.

Why does Heaven’s **Dao** operate thus?
Because Heaven’s net is vast and wide,
open yet never misses.

Heaven encompasses the great Earth,
its vast net.
Empty and void, yet never misses.

**Virtue** says: In the use of arms, there are words:
Do not dare to be the aggressor but instead the defender,
do not dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot.

Boldness in decisive daring,
means being the aggressor and advancing an inch—
hence it meets death.
Boldness in not daring,
means being the defender and retreating a foot—
hence it leads to life.

These two bring either benefit or harm:
some dare to die and meet death,
some dare to live and remain alive—
let each choose their own boldness.

What Heaven abhors,
who among the world knows its reason?
Thus, the Sage still finds this difficult,
the great transformation of nature.

Hence, the **Dao** of Heaven,
does not contend yet naturally triumphs—
it must first expand to then contract,
this is the **Dao** of yielding and taking.

Does not speak yet naturally responds—
the four seasons proceed,
all things flourish—
this is the **Dao** of Earth.

Does not summon yet they come on their own—
all things teeming,
each returns to its root.

Plain and clear yet well-planned—
the **Dao** of Heaven completes its three hundred and sixty degrees,
the Five Stars unite in twenty-eight constellations,
the Sun and Moon run their courses,
one cold and one hot,
nurturing and completing all things to form one year—
how could there be any deception?
Hence it is said: plain and clear yet well-planned.

Entering the **Dao** is formless and nameless,
stateless and without image,
yet it threads all things,
all contained within.

This is called: open yet never missing.

**Chapter Seventy-Four: The Way of Death**
The people do not commonly fear death,
how could one use the **Dao** of death to frighten them?
If one makes the people fear death,
and they commit extraordinary acts,
I might seize and kill them—
who would dare?

There are always those appointed to kill who kill.
If one substitutes for those appointed to kill,
this is called substituting for the Master Carpenter to wield the axe.

If one substitutes for the Master Carpenter to wield the axe,
there are few who do not injure their own hands.

The Classic states: The people originally do not fear death,
how could one use the **Dao** of death to frighten them?
If one makes the people fear death,
and they commit extraordinary acts,
one assumes I might seize and kill them—
who would dare to face this?

There are always those appointed to kill who kill.
If one substitutes for those appointed to kill,
this is called substituting for the Master Carpenter to wield the axe.
If one substitutes for the Master Carpenter to wield the axe,
there are few who do not injure their own hands.

The **Dao** says: Returning to the origin and reversing to the end,
one knows the explanation of death and life.
All under Heaven know that life has death,
just as night and day must follow—
this is ignorance of the **Dao** that life contains death,
and death contains life.

The people who do not commonly fear death,
do not know the **Dao** of life.
If one makes them know there is life,
who would not fear death?
Hence, in human nature,
boldness in daring leads to death.

How could one use the **Dao** of death to frighten them?
This is to make them know the **Dao** of death.
If one makes them know the **Dao** of death,
who would not rejoice in life?
Hence, in human undertakings,
boldness in not daring leads to life.

If one assumes I might seize and kill them—
who would dare to face this?
There is always the **Dao** of Nature itself,
so those appointed to kill will surely kill those who should die.
Heaven and Earth create all things—
those who should not die will not be killed,
this is the appointed order.

If one substitutes for those appointed to kill,
this is human effort and artificial action—
it is like substituting for the Master Carpenter
who swings the axe with the wind’s force to fell timber.

If one substitutes for the Master Carpenter to wield the axe,
if they truly possess the Master Carpenter’s skill,
they will exhaust the adze’s blade yet not harm their nose.
If they merely substitute and act in place,
how could they not exhaust the adze’s blade,
and even those who do not harm their own hands are few indeed?

**Virtue** says: If the people do not fear **威** (awe),
then the greatest **威** will arrive.
Thus, the **Dao** of awe is set,
so the people do not weary of it.

If the people do not fear death,
then the greatest death will arrive.
Thus, the **Dao** of death is set,
so the people know to fear.

If the people do not commonly fear death,
how could one use the **Dao** of death to frighten them?
By this reasoning,
people originally do fear death.

If one makes the people fear death,
Heaven and Earth’s natural creation
will surely not allow one to kill those who should not die.
Thus, those who commit extraordinary acts against the **Dao**,
even Heaven and Earth’s creation cannot kill them—
if one assumes they can be seized and killed,
who would dare to face this?

As for those appointed to kill who kill,
they also kill those who originally did not fear death
and should die.
But those who fear death and should not die—
how could one seize and kill them?

Those who substitute for the officials of death
are even worse than those with fixed punishments—
this is called substituting for the master carpenter to hew wood.
Even the wheelwright Ruòbiàn finds this difficult,
let alone the chisels and mallets.
Few escape uninjured hands.

**Chapter 75: The People’s Hunger**
The people’s hunger arises from their rulers’ excessive taxation.
Thus, the people suffer hunger.
The people are hard to govern because their rulers act excessively.
Thus, they are hard to govern.
The people grow indifferent to death because their pursuit of life is excessive.
Thus, they grow indifferent to death.
Only those who do not make life their concern
are truly superior to those who prize life.

The *Classic* says:
The people’s hunger arises from their rulers’ excessive taxation.
Thus, the people suffer hunger.
The people are hard to govern because their rulers act excessively.
Thus, they are hard to govern.
The people grow indifferent to death because their pursuit of life is excessive.
Thus, they grow indifferent to death.
Only those who do not make life their concern
are superior to those who prize life.

The *Way* says:
The kitchen has fat meat,
the stables have fat horses,
yet the people show signs of hunger,
and the fields are strewn with starving corpses—
this is to drive beasts while letting people starve.
Even beasts would abhor devouring one another,
so how can those who rule stand idly by
while their people starve to death?
Thus, it is said:
The people’s hunger arises from their rulers consuming too much of their taxes.
If I do nothing, the people will transform themselves.
If I love stillness, the people will align themselves—
like water, which can bear a boat
or overturn it.
When laws are pushed to extremes, deceit arises;
when orders are issued, trickery follows.
Thus, the people are hard to govern
because their rulers act excessively.
If the ruler does nothing, the world will govern itself.
Those who love excessively must spend excessively,
and those who hoard excessively will lose excessively.
Knowing contentment brings no disgrace,
knowing limits brings no peril.
This is how one endures long.
Thus, the people grow indifferent to death
because their pursuit of life is excessive.
Only those who make the *Dao* their master
and do not make life their concern
are even more superior to those who prize life—
is this not clear?

The *Virtue* says:
What the ruler favors, the people will follow to excess.
The spirit loves clarity, yet the mind disturbs it;
the mind loves stillness, yet desires drag it.
If one constantly dismisses desire, the mind will still itself;
if one clarifies the mind, the spirit will purify itself.
Thus, the six desires will not arise,
and the three poisons will vanish.

The people’s hunger arises from their rulers consuming too much of their taxes.
Thus, the people suffer hunger.
The people’s *qi* weakens when their virtue is disordered.
Thus, their *qi* weakens.
The people are hard to govern because their rulers act excessively;
*qi* is hard to nurture because the mind is unsettled.
The people grow indifferent to death because their pursuit of life is excessive;
people grow indifferent to death because their cultivation of life is shallow.
Only those who do not make seeking life their concern,
but instead make cultivating life their sole concern—
though the path of seeking life is indeed precious,
the path of cultivating life is far superior to seeking life.
Thus, it is said: *This is superior to prizing life.*

**Chapter 76: The People’s Birth**
The people’s birth is soft and weak,
yet their death is rigid and strong.
All things—grasses and trees—
begin soft and tender,
yet end withered and brittle.
Thus, rigidity and strength belong to death,
while softness and weakness belong to life.
Therefore, strong armies do not conquer,
and strong trees are felled.
The strong and mighty dwell below,
the soft and weak dwell above.

The *Classic* says:
When people are born, they are soft and weak;
when they die, they are rigid and strong.
All things—grasses and trees—
in their birth are soft and tender,
yet in their death are withered and brittle.
Thus, rigidity and strength belong to death,
while softness and weakness belong to life.
Therefore, strong armies do not conquer,
and strong trees are felled.
Thus, the strong and mighty dwell below,
the soft and weak dwell above.

The *Way* says:
Water, though the gentlest, does not empty the four seas,
yet mountains, though the firmest, will eventually erode.
Thus, what is supremely soft in the world
overcomes what is supremely hard,
and what is supremely weak
overcomes what is supremely strong.
Therefore, when people are born, they are soft and weak,
yet when they die, they are rigid and strong.
As for all things—grasses and trees—
in their beginning, they are soft and tender,
so *Zhen* and *Xùn* govern them,
and even barren or salty lands
return to life and rise to the empty heights—
there is no doubt.
When they near death, they become rigid and strong,
so *Kǎn* and *Lǐ* govern them,
and their hearts become hard,
their branches withered and brittle.
Thus, it is said:
Rigidity and strength belong to death,
while softness and weakness belong to life.
Therefore, strong armies do not conquer,
and strong trees are felled—
as when a woodcutter fells a tree.
Thus, the strong and mighty dwell below,
the soft and weak dwell above.

*Zhen* and *Duì* are the yin of Heaven.
*Xùn* and *Gèn* are the yang of Earth.
Heaven, in terms of birth, has yin above and yang below—
the principle of mutual harmony.
Earth, in terms of completion, has yang above and yin below—
the principle of rank and order.
Thus, when Earth is above Heaven, it is *Tài* (harmony),
and when Heaven is above Earth, it is *Pǐ* (blockage).
Therefore, the strong and mighty dwell below,
the soft and weak dwell above—
this is the principle of Heaven and Earth.

The *Virtue* says:
*Kūn* and *Lián* intermingle to produce *Kǎn* and *Lǐ*.
*Kǎn* originates from *Kūn*’s body,
taking the central *yáng* line of *Lián*—
thus, it is called the "central male."
*Lǐ* originates from *Lián*’s body,
taking the central *yīn* line of *Kūn*—
thus, it is called the "central female."
*Kǎn* is externally yin and internally yang—
thus, it is the "central male."
*Lǐ* is externally yang and internally yin—
thus, it is the "central female."
The male is externally yang and internally yin—
the symbol of *Lǐ*’s fire.
The female is externally yin and internally yang—
the symbol of *Kǎn*’s water.
This is what is meant by:
*The sun and moon shine together,
and water and fire are inverted.*

In essence, those who nurture life
must take the single *yáng* within *Kǎn*
and return the single *yīn* within *Lǐ*.
Thus, the Purple Sage says:
*"Take the central substance of the *Kǎn* position,
and transmute the inner yin of the *Lǐ* palace."*

From here, the body becomes the robust *Kūn*—
its hidden leaps and ascents all depend on the mind.

For this reason:
Human life begins in softness—
the *yīn* within *Lǐ*.
At death, the heart grows rigid—
the single *yáng* within *Kǎn*.
*Yīn* governs death—how then does it speak of life?
*Yáng* governs life—how then does it speak of death?
Without inversion, without reversal,
it would not be called the *Dao*.

Indeed, *yīn* without *yáng* cannot generate,
*yáng* without *yīn* cannot perish—
this is to rob Heaven and Earth of their transformations.
Thus, inversion is necessary—
even for all things, plants, and grasses.

Therefore, the strong descend while the weak ascend,
*yīn* above, *yáng* rushing beneath—
its meaning is profound indeed.

**Chapter Seventy-Seventh: The Way of Heaven**
The *Dao* of Heaven—is it not like drawing a bow?
The high are pressed down, the low are raised,
the excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.
The *Dao* of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient,
but the *Dao* of humanity is otherwise:
it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.
Who can use the excessive to nourish the world?
Only the *Dao*-bearer.

Thus, the Sage acts without claiming,
achieves without dwelling—
not desiring to be seen as virtuous.
The *Classic* says:
*The *Dao* of Heaven—is it not like drawing a bow?
The high must be pressed down, the low must be raised,
the excessive must be diminished, the deficient must be supplemented.
The *Dao* of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient,
but the *Dao* of humanity is otherwise:
it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.
Who diminishes the excessive to nourish the world?
Only the *Dao*-bearer can do so.

Thus, the Sage acts in *wuwei* yet does not rely on it,
achieves without taking credit—
not desiring to display virtue or praise.
The *Dao* says:
*The *Dao* of Heaven is round and divine,
embracing the great earth,
giving birth and completing all things—
the image of a drawn bow.
The Heaven above the earth
always uses half its arc—
the image of a released bow.
The high are pressed down, the low are raised—
this is the sun yielding to the moon,
the moon yielding to the sun,
day and moon pushing against each other, generating brightness.
Cold yielding to heat, heat yielding to cold,
cold and heat pushing against each other, completing the year.

The excessive are diminished—
autumn harvest, winter storage.
The deficient are supplemented—
spring growth, summer flourishing.
This is called the *Dao* of Heaven:
diminishing the excessive and supplementing the deficient,
gathering the abundant and aiding the scarce,
balancing things and applying evenly.

But the *Dao* of humanity is otherwise:
the deficient are diminished—
the people’s hunger.
The excessive are served—
the ruler’s heavy taxes.
This is called the *Dao* of humanity:
diminishing the deficient to serve the excessive,
plundering the low to raise the high,
severing the short to lengthen the long.

Having diminished the deficient to serve the excessive,
who can then use the excessive to nourish the world’s deficiencies?
Only the *Dao*-bearer can do so.
Thus, the Sage acts in *wuwei* yet does not serve himself,
achieves without taking residence—
not desiring to display virtue or praise,
yet causing the Great *Dao* to lean toward nourishment,
preventing excess and deficiency.

**Chapter Seventy-Eighth: The World’s Gentleness**
Nowhere is the world’s gentleness and weakness greater than in water,
yet nothing can surpass it in overcoming hardness.
Caution—do not treat it lightly.
The weak overcoming the strong, the gentle overcoming the firm—
all know this, yet none can practice it.

Thus, the Sage says:
*"To bear a nation’s filth is to be its sovereign;
to bear a nation’s misfortune is to be its king."*
Straight speech inverted.

The *Classic* says:
*"Nowhere is the world’s gentleness and weakness greater than in water,
yet nothing can surpass it in overcoming hardness—
caution, do not treat it lightly.
The weak overcoming the strong, the gentle overcoming the firm—
all know this, yet none can practice it.
Thus, the Sage says:
To bear a nation’s filth is to be its sovereign;
to bear a nation’s misfortune is to be its king.
To bear filth and rule, to bear misfortune and reign—
the Sage’s straight speech is inverted."*

The *Dao* says:
*Kǎn* is extreme gentleness—
its water ascends and descends between Heaven and Earth.
*Kūn* is slight gentleness—
its earth gives birth and completes all things.
Yet the earth of *Kūn* shapes all things,
while the water of *Kǎn* circulates their *qi*.
Thus, what moistens all things is nothing like water—
hence, the world’s gentleness and weakness are nowhere greater than in water.
Its water and *qi* flow without entering,
yet flow without failing to conquer—
while overcoming hardness, nothing can surpass it.
Caution—do not treat its water lightly.
Water, water—
thus it is said: *It cannot be replaced.*

The *Dao* of weakness overcoming strength, of gentleness conquering rigidity—
the world knows this well, yet none can practice it.
How then could one treat its water as trifling?

Great indeed is the *Dao* of water’s timely virtue.

Thus the Sage declares:
To bear a nation’s filth and humiliation—
this is called the sovereign of the *altars of soil and grain* (社稷).
To bear a nation’s calamities—
this is called the king of the world.
Water embodies this *symbol* (象).

Weakness overcoming strength, gentleness conquering rigidity,
bearing filth to rule, enduring calamity to reign—
all are *straight speech inverted* (正言若反).

The *virtue/power* (德) says:
True *essence* (精) is most gentle,
true *qi* most feeble—
*Kǎn*’s water conceals them,
all bearing names yet no form,
the sovereign of the body.

Once the *essence* and *qi* are exhausted,
though bones and sinews claim firmness,
soon they become dung and dust.

By this reasoning,
the world’s gentleness and feebleness
nowhere surpass water’s,
yet none can conquer hardness as it does.
Who dares to belittle and despise it?

Thus it is said: *It cannot be replaced.*
The *Dao* of water’s gentleness overcoming strength,
of gentleness conquering rigidity—
the world knows this truth,
yet none can enact its practice.
Great indeed is water’s *Dao* as the *Way*.

Thus the Sage declares:
To bear a nation’s filth and humiliation—
this is weakness overcoming strength,
weakness overcoming strength—
this is called the sovereign of the *altars of soil and grain*.
To bear a nation’s calamities—
this is gentleness conquering rigidity,
gentleness conquering rigidity—
this is called the king of the world.
All are *straight speech inverted*.
(*Chapter Seventy-Nine: Harmonizing Great Grievances*)

To reconcile great grievances, there must remain lingering resentment—
how then can it be called good?

Thus the Sage holds the left contract,
yet does not demand recompense from others.

Therefore, those of *virtue* oversee the contract,
while those without oversee the law.

The *Dao* of Heaven favors none,
always aligning with those of goodness.

The *sutra* says:
To reconcile great grievances, there must remain lingering resentment—
how then can it be called good?

Auspicious matters favor the left,
contracts replacing cords and bonds.
Thus the Sage always holds the auspicious covenant,
yet does not demand recompense from others.

Therefore, those of *virtue* oversee the contract,
while those without oversee the law.

*Simpai* (彻) is the law.

The *Dao* of Heaven favors none,
always aligning with those of goodness.

The *Way* declares:
Goodly closures require no bolt or bar yet cannot be opened,
goodly bindings require no cord or knot yet cannot be undone.
When great enmity has already formed and is then resolved,
there must remain lingering enmity—
how then can it be called trustworthy?
When great resentment has already manifested and is then reconciled,
there must remain lingering resentment—
how then can it be called good?

Thus the Sage holds the left contract,
saying: goodly bindings require no cord or knot yet cannot be undone,
and does not demand from others—
this is called goodly closures requiring no bolt or bar yet cannot be opened.
Only those of *virtue* can oversee the contract,
while those without *virtue* merely oversee the law.

Thus the Imperial Heaven favors none,
only *virtue* does it assist;
the *Dao* of Heaven favors none,
always aligning with those of goodness.

*Virtue* says:
When Heaven and Earth unite, sweet dew descends,
when Yin and Yang harmonize, winds and rains come in season—
the beginning of *yīn-yáng*’s *sūn-yǐ* (损益) and flourishing decline.

When three Yangs emerge from Earth, it is *Tāi* (泰) of Earth-Heaven,
Earth-Heaven *Tāi* in square form—
three above intersecting, diminishing its flourishing.
When three Yins emerge from Earth, it is *Pǐ* (否) of Heaven-Earth,
Heaven-Earth *Pǐ* in square form—
the first four intersecting, augmenting its decline.

Thus it is said: the beginning of *sūn-yǐ* and flourishing decline.

Thus *Tāi* can generate things,
I can complete things,
so that all things under Heaven constantly lament
that Heaven and Earth do not practice *sūn-yǐ*.

Great as Heaven and Earth, small as all things,
all rely on *yīn-yáng* to form their vessels—
how much more so for humanity?

When Yang leads and Yin harmonizes,
this is called man and wife dwelling together.
When Yang leads and Yin defies,
this is called husband and wife turning against each other—
how much more so for great grievances?

When great grievance has already formed,
then to reconcile it—
to reconcile and provoke resentment,
there must remain lingering resentment.
With lingering resentment,
how then can it be called good?

When great resentment has already manifested,
then to save it—
to save and provoke anger,
there must remain lingering anger.
With lingering anger,
how then can it be called aid?

Thus the Sage always holds the left contract,
to overcome strength with weakness,
not demanding from others,
to overcome rigidity with gentleness.

Those of *virtue* oversee the contract, holding to gentleness.
Those without *virtue* oversee the law, holding to rigidity.

Thus the *Dao* of Heaven does not falter,
always aligning with the left contract;
the *Dao* of Heaven favors none,
always aligning with those of goodness.

*Chapter Eighty: Small States, Few People*

Small states, though few in people,
each hundred or ten has its leader,
people merely use tools yet do not serve the state.
They value death and do not flee far.

Though there are boats and chariots,
they have no use for them;
though there are armor and weapons,
they have no need to display them.
They return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.

They find their food sweet,
their clothing fine,
their dwellings secure,
their customs joyous.

Neighboring states are visible to one another,
the sounds of roosters and dogs heard between them.
People die of old age
without ever visiting one another.

The *sutra* says:
Small states, though few in people,
each hundred or ten has its leader,
people merely use tools yet do not serve the state.
They value death and do not flee far.

Though there are boats and chariots,
they have no use for them;
though there are armor and weapons,
they have no need to display them;

They return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.
Their food is sweet, their clothing fine,
their dwellings secure, their customs joyous.

Neighboring states lie in sight of one another,
the sounds of roosters and dogs heard across them,
yet people grow old and die
without ever knowing of public or private affairs between them.

The *Dao* says:
Tang ruled with seventy *li*, King Wen with a hundred *li*,
yet both held sway over the world—
both were small states with few people.

Thus, when boundaries were properly set
and the *jing* fields evenly distributed,
each commoner and housewife received a hundred *mu* of land,
and people were given leaders by tens and hundreds,
yet they did not lend or borrow from one another.

Then, the stipends of high, middle, and low officials were equalized,
and people were merely used as tools,
not conscripted for state service—
hence, "they are used as tools yet not for state purposes,"
leading people to value death and not flee far.

Though there are boats and chariots,
they have no place to go and ride them;
though there are armor and weapons,
they have no direction to deploy them;
they return to the ancient practice of knotted cords.

They till the fields and fish,
and their food is sweet.
They wear coarse hemp and bound shoes,
and their clothing is fine.
They dwell in caves and live in the wild,
and their homes are secure.
They drum their bellies and strike the earth,
and their customs are joyous.

Neighboring states lie in sight of one another,
the crowing of roosters and barking of dogs heard across them,
reaching to the four borders,
yet people grow old and die
without knowing of public or private affairs between them.

The *virtue/power* says:
Wealth and nobility bring security to the people—
this is when their *qi* is full and their *jing* abundant.
Small states with few people—
this is when their *qi* is weak and their *jing* depleted.

Though their *qi* is weak and their *jing* depleted,
there is still a way to restore decline and renew old age.
Up to a hundred and twenty years, one may yet return,
but beyond that, refining true sincerity becomes difficult—
one must rely on the nine-turns, eight-essence elixir,
the luminous essence of sun and moon to heal the aged and infirm—
how much more so for the small states with few people?

Those whose *qi* is weak and *jing* depleted
are the people who have exhausted the sixty-four *gua*.
They must first ensure each of the five *zang* and six *fu* has its master—
this is the *Yellow Court Inner Classic*.
Hence, "they have leaders by tens and hundreds."

Though one may set up furnaces and cauldrons,
it is merely for nurturing the medicine,
daring not to smelt, refine, or decoct—
hence, "they are used as tools yet not put to use."
They build elixir chambers and place cauldrons and vessels,
preserving them with care, using them sparingly,
so that people value death and do not flee far.

Though there are swift boats and racing chariots,
they have no place to ride them;
though there are strong armor and sharp weapons,
they have no direction to deploy them.

The people return to using knotted cords for reckoning.

This is called restoring the art of secure closure—
locks without bars that cannot be opened,
knots without cords that cannot be undone.
Is this not profound?

Thus, under Heaven’s great peace, one becomes a noble of the Primordial Sovereign,
delighting in their food, admiring their garments,
dwelling in ease, rejoicing in their customs,
where the Twelve Palaces address one another as *ér* and *rú* in forgetfulness.
Neighboring lands face each other,
the sounds of roosters and dogs intermingling—
the Twelve Channels harmonizing within and without.

If such harmony is attained,
until one’s natural end, with no further mingling with the vulgar world,
is this not fitting?

*"True words are not ornate"* (Chapter 81)
True words are not ornate; ornate words are not true.
The virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.
The wise are not erudite; the erudite are not wise.
The sage does not hoard—
giving to others, the more they possess;
sharing with others, the more they have.

The Dao of Heaven benefits without harming;
The sage’s Dao acts without contention.
The Classic says:
True words are not ornate; ornate words are not true.
The virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.
The wise are not erudite; the erudite are not wise.
The sage’s clarity is boundless—
what need has it for accumulation?
Giving to others, the more they possess;
sharing with others, the more they have.

The Dao of Heaven benefits without harming;
The sage’s Dao acts without contention.
The *Dao* declares:
When spoken, its flavor is faint and insipid.
When the Great Dao is abandoned, benevolence and righteousness arise;
When wisdom emerges, great deceit follows.
True words are not ornate.
Light promises bring few fulfillments;
many easy things bring many difficulties—
ornate words are not true.
All things rely on it to thrive yet it makes no claim;
when the work is done, it takes no credit—
the virtuous do not argue.
Its governance is subtle, yet its people are simple;
those who argue are not virtuous.
The wise do not speak; the wise are not erudite.
Those who speak are not wise; the erudite are not wise.

The sage’s Dao resides in the Supreme Ultimate,
a boundless clarity of *qi*, possessing all things—
thus it does not hoard.
Using this Dao for others, one’s own abundance increases;
sharing this Dao with others, one’s own wealth multiplies.
Thus, the Dao of Heaven benefits without harming—
none under Heaven can harm it.
The sage’s Dao acts without contention—
none under Heaven can contend with it.

*Virtue* declares:
True words are not ornate—this is the Great Dao of non-action.
Ornate words are not true—these are minor, tangential arts.
The virtuous do not argue—few are the words of the fortunate.
Those who argue are not virtuous—their words are many and hasty.
The wise are not erudite—they grasp the One through which all things pass.
The erudite are not wise—they rely on memorization and inquiry.

The sage’s Dao need not accumulate much—
the One generates the Two,
the Two generate the Three,
the Three generate all things—this suffices.

When this Dao is given to others,
others become oneself;
when all are oneself,
one’s own abundance grows.
When this Dao is shared with others,
others become oneself;
when all are oneself,
one’s own wealth multiplies.

Thus, the Dao of Primordial Heaven
benefits all under Heaven without harming others—
all clothe themselves in its teachings.
The sage’s Dao
acts for all under Heaven without contention—
all are adorned by its virtue.
When *Dao* and *virtue* clothe all under Heaven,
the achievements of the Primordial Sage are complete.
