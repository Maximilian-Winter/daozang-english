**The Supreme Three Primordials Talisman for Pacifying the Household**

On the fifteenth day of the tenth month in the *renshen* year, at the *yin* hour, the Supreme Jade Emperor of the Utmost Non-Polarity, the Great Dao Lord of the Primordial Beginning of the Supreme Three Primordials, descended to the Upper Palace of the Layered City upon Kunlun Mountain. At that time, the assembled Perfected hovered in the void, their majestic radiance resplendent above the ethereal clouds. The Lord issued a luminous decree to the Seven Perfected of Golden Radiance, saying: "You shall serve as the true Dharma masters of the ten directions for the coming kalpa. Those who aspire to perfection must first prioritize saving the world, widely accumulating merit to deliver all celestial and human beings. Such merit is supreme; when merit is perfected and virtue universal, the Dao is naturally attained."

Thereupon, the Seven Perfected preserved their true nature, observing the ten contemplations. Golden radiance and primordial light dissolved into stillness, and the Mysterious Heavenly Worthy appeared in the wondrous realm of the Utmost Non-Being of the Supreme Three Primordials. They bowed their heads in reverence and inquired of the Heavenly Worthy: "In recent years, the Three Realms have collapsed, and between heaven and earth, the *qi* of humans, ghosts, and warfare clamors day and night. In this age of the final kalpa, how could we, the Seven Perfected, in our ignorance and delusion, know how to bring salvation? We humbly beseech your enlightenment, that we may attain right awakening in this realm and serve as a bridge of Dharma to save the world—not only bestowing blessings in this life but also delivering future generations and broadly guiding those yet to come. We implore the Heavenly Worthy to reveal the truth and pardon our inadequacies."

Then the Heavenly Worthy addressed the Seven Perfected of Golden Radiance, saying: "You are destined to receive the prophecy and become the true Dharma masters of the ten directions, the great sages of the orthodox Dharma. You shall turn the Wheel of the Golden Perfected Dharma. This Dharma Wheel is the supreme, wondrous, and orthodox king among the great vehicles of the true Dharma. Its merit is towering and vast, encompassing all phenomena, possessing boundless virtue beyond comparison. Only the loftiest and most noble of beings could establish such merit and lay this foundation of blessings. Yet the sentient beings of the Three Realms are drowning in the sea of suffering. The dead lie buried in the dark night, their souls enduring myriad torments, while the living, unfortunate to encounter this final kalpa, suffer under the cycles of the Three Calamities and Five Defilements. A hundred evils converge, and disasters and warfare persist—how can this not evoke sorrow?

However, the great merit of the supreme vehicle is not something the multitudes of the world can ordinarily cultivate. Therefore, I now bestow upon you the *Great Register of the Upper Primordial Heavenly Officials, the Divine Tallies for Restraining Ghosts, Subduing Demons, and Seizing Spirits*, entrusting it to you under the name *The Supreme Three Primordials Talisman for Pacifying the Household*. With this, you may assist the upright *qi* of heaven and earth, aid the state and the times, and align with the mandates of the Three Primordials, thereby delivering the world. It is sealed with the seal of the Supreme Three Primordials. When placed above the halls and doorways of celestial and human dwellings, it will drive away the malevolent spirits, plagues, epidemics, and disasters of the ten and five directions, the *qi* of a hundred poisons, inauspicious omens, demonic apparitions, and anomalous phenomena, restraining them all. It will prevent the leakage of myriad calamities, warfare, ghosts, and spirits, forever preserving the household in effortless tranquility. Those who obtain it will be safeguarded from the Three Calamities and the great tribulations of the Five Defilements. If a virtuous ruler of a nation encounters this Dao, their reign will be peaceful, and as the ruler and ministers practice the Dao, the state will endure long.

The Seven Perfected then bowed their heads and prostrated themselves, receiving the sacred register. The Heavenly Worthy declared: "Now I shall universally proclaim this to heaven and earth, that all may bear witness to this covenant." At the head of the pacifying talisman, it commands the restraint of all improper *qi*, guiding them into the orthodox Dharma. The Seven Perfected bowed in reverence and received it, pledging to the Heavenly Worthy: "We shall diligently follow the Dharma as prescribed." Upon the completion of the rite, the Heavenly Worthy ascended into the void and vanished.

**Supreme, Supreme, Supreme Primordial Most High Jade Emperor of the Boundless Dao, Pure and True Orthodox Dharma.**

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: Upon sealing the *Supreme Three Origins Talisman of Household Protection and Upper Numinous Register*, when the three celestial talismans within the register are activated, one shall visualize the Supreme, Supreme, Supreme Primordial Most High Jade Emperor of the Dao, his golden countenance radiant and luminous, descending together with the Three Venerables of Golden Radiance, coalescing and abiding in the cloudy void above. One shall further visualize the Three Generals of the Three Heavens, each with thirty-six myriad soldiers, cavalry, officers, and troops, filling the ten directions, all coming to secure and defend [Name]’s residence with thirty-six myriad layers, no different from mortal armies.

The talismanic incantation is as follows:
*"Void and Jade Emperor, the Jade Heaven opens forthwith,
The Jade Clarity issues its decree, named Golden Perfection.
The Jade Void’s luminous might, the Three Heavens generate spirits,
Orthodox dharma’s mysterious model, the talisman commands the Nine Heavens.
Gather qi to assist the omen, inspect the essence as flowing smoke,
Command ghosts and summon demons, sweep away all impurities.
Spiritual generals secure the defense, celestial soldiers as neighbors,
The orthodox Dao moves in motion, protecting the omen this dawn.
Myriad spirits crushed and destroyed, dare not encroach upon the omen’s body.
I command the divine lords, universally brushing away demonic dust.
Those who do good shall be promoted, those who rebel shall be expelled."*

Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: For all celestial, human, and terrestrial beings who first receive the *Supreme Three Origins Talisman of Household Protection and Upper Numinous Register*, they shall offer two *shi* and four *dou* of life-sustaining rice from the Mysterious Capital’s Register of Destiny, along with five-colored silks corresponding to the five directions in appropriate quantities, one bolt each of purple-woven and plain white silk, and two strings and four hundred cash. These shall be presented with the twenty-four life-generating qi of the Upper Origin, corresponding to the twenty-four life-generating spirits’ primordial destiny, also symbolizing the twenty-four grottoes of primordial generation, and below, the twenty-four spirits representing the numbers of the Three Origins. All shall comply with the statutory provisions without violation.

The Seven Perfected state: For celestial, human, and terrestrial beings first undertaking this rite, they may also offer one *shi* and two *dou* of rice, one string and two hundred cash, and twelve bolts of silk; or eight bolts of silk, eight hundred cash, and eight bolts of silk. The twelve numbers correspond to the twelve perfected spirits, and the eight numbers accord with the eight trigrams.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: For all celestial, human, and terrestrial beings who receive the *Supreme Three Origins Talisman of Household Protection and Upper Numinous Register*, they shall annually deliver two *shi* and four *dou* of life-sustaining rice from the Mysterious Capital’s Upper Origin, along with five-colored silks, plain white silks, and cash, to the master’s gate. The master, having received the disciple’s life-sustaining rice, silks, and cash, shall allocate eight portions for meritorious deeds, to be offered to the emperors and sovereigns of the ten directions and all heavens, as well as the local imperial lords and kings, for the establishment of grand feasts of the Golden Perfection Dharma Wheel. Another eight portions shall be used to establish the Three Origins, promoting and rewarding the generals, soldiers, and officers of household protection for the disciple, reporting their merits and advancing their ranks. Eight portions shall be used to provide for the impoverished throughout the world and the Daoist recluses dwelling in the mountains. Violators shall be judged according to the penal statutes of the Nine Capitals.

The Seven Perfected state: For celestial beings who are impoverished, they may also offer rice, silk, and cash without fixed quantities, to fulfill the master’s requirements for meritorious deeds.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: For all celestial, human, and terrestrial beings who receive the *Supreme Three Origins Talisman of Household Protection and Upper Numinous Register*, if they fail to deliver the life-sustaining rice within the prescribed time, the Three Heavens’ Bureau of Destiny shall deduct ten years from the omen’s lifespan. If they comply with the annual offerings to the master’s gate, the Bureau of Destiny shall add ten years to the omen’s lifespan, all in accordance with the statutes.

Disciples shall cultivate themselves, purify their conduct, establish natural fasts, burn incense, practice the Dao, recite scriptures, perform repentance rites, and illuminate the night with lamps. They shall pray for blessings six times daily and nightly, promoting and rewarding the celestial officials of household protection. If no master is present in the disciple’s dwelling to perform the rites, household members may also visualize Golden Radiance in their hearts and maintain equilibrium—this, too, is essential. On the Three Origins’ days, if disciples do not observe fasts and uphold precepts, the Upper Origin’s Jade Bureau celestial officials shall not inscribe the omen’s name in the Register of Primordial Life, and they shall be judged according to the Three Punishments statutes.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: Should the Son of Heaven, kings, or feudal lords seek to pacify the state, secure the people, and enjoy boundless prosperity while safeguarding the altars of soil and grain, they shall all seal this numinous register to secure the gates of the imperial palace and the kingdom’s halls.

The Seven Perfected state: The emperors, supreme emperors, and celestial lords of the ten directions and all heavens shall each seal this register upon the jade caskets and gates of their celestial palaces.

Moreover, how much more does this apply to the Son of Heaven, kings, and feudal lords of the lower realms?

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: The flying celestial emperors of the ten directions, all Brahma-heaven kings, and the celestial lords of the Five Directions and Five Emperors shall each seal this numinous register to secure the movements of Heaven and Earth, to safeguard the proper measure of the primordial celestial origin, to harmonize and regulate the qi of yin and yang, thereby attaining the transformations of spontaneity and ruling through the spontaneity of natural order.

The Seven Perfected state: If even the supreme emperors and perfected sages of the ten directions’ heavens revere and uphold this numinous register, how much more should the people of the world below do so?

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: Should a Dharma-master, when sealing the numinous register for a disciple, collect the life-rice, sealing offerings, or faith tokens, yet fail to employ them according to the three-grade standards for merit-bestowing purposes, the Dharma-master shall be bound and examined by the officials of the Nine Capitals and judged according to the Nine Kalpas’ penal statutes.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: If a Dharma-master collects from a disciple the yearly repayment of life-rice, sealing offerings, or faith tokens for personal use or to provide for his family, yet fails to establish merit and blessings for the disciple, his offense shall be examined by the officials of the Nine Capitals and his name recorded under the statutes of the Three Punishments and Five Kalpas.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: Should a Dharma-master, on the great celebratory days of the Three Origins, fail to establish merit for his disciple or promote and reward the generals, soldiers, and officers, the Dharma-master shall incur misfortune and punishment in the capital of the Dead King and his name recorded under the statutes of the Three Punishments and examination laws.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: Should a Dharma-master, on the days of the Three Origins, be unable to petition the Jade Bureau of the Three Heavens on behalf of a disciple’s household to inscribe their names in the Register of Life of the Upper Office of Divine Birth, the Dharma-master shall suffer various calamities in this life and, upon death, be judged under the statutes of the Nine Dark Prisons and Nine Punishments.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: In all the boundless worlds of the ten directions’ heavens and earths, should any household among the common people—men or women—encounter disasters, strange omens, or monstrous anomalies; should malevolent spirits summon hordes of misfortune; or should they perpetually bring harm to the celestial and human realms, they must, in accordance with the Orthodox Dharma, present life-rice, life-silks, life-plain cloth, and spirit money to the Dharma-master to seal the numinous register.

The Seven Perfected state: Those who obtain the numinous register shall not only be protected from disasters and calamities but also avert the great and minor Yang-Nine and great and minor Hundred-Six catastrophes in years of water, fire, wind, or blade.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: Should the Orthodox Dharma disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths seal this numinous register upon the gates and doors of their palaces and residences, it shall render the qi of humans and spirits pure and clear, the palace and residence solemn and serene. The heavens shall send protection, the officials of the Three Realms shall all come to guard the gates, and the celestial and terrestrial deities shall serve the Orthodox Dharma disciples, perpetually paying homage and bowing before the numinous register while defending the gates and courtyards, none daring to harbor harmful intent.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: Should the Orthodox Dharma disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths encounter illnesses, calamities, or misfortunes in their households; should yin perils, water, fire, bandits, or thieves threaten harm; or should they perpetually suffer invasions or disturbances, the head of the household may bathe, don solemn attire, maintain a fast, burn incense beneath the numinous register, perform nine bows, and then declare the severity of the disaster or calamity, petitioning for relief while concentrating the mind upon the Three Departments.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: Should the households of the Orthodox Dharma disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths gain a member after three years, they must reseal the numinous register. If a household loses fortune and a member after three years, they must also reseal the numinous register. If there is neither gain nor loss after three years, resealing is unnecessary, but the register must be renewed and resealed after nine years. Should the register not be renewed, the generals, soldiers, and officers shall receive merit and ascend to heaven, and thus the register must be renewed and resealed. Should the disciple fail to renew it after nine years, he shall be judged according to the Three Punishments statutes.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: The Orthodox Dharma disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths who seal the numinous register must not worship talismanic temples, ghostly deities, heterodox masters, or shamans, nor seek blessings through fragile offerings. Those who violate this shall be judged according to the Three Punishments statutes.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: After sealing the numinous register, the Orthodox Dharma disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths must not summon non-human entities, nor invite qi-manipulators, female mediums, or entertainers to perform songs and dances within their residences. Those who engage in such non-Orthodox practices shall be judged under the statutes of the Three Punishments of the Dark Prisons.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: The Orthodox Dharma disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths who seal the numinous register must not betray their master or violate their covenant. Those who do so shall have their generals and soldiers ascend to the celestial palaces, never again to guard their residences. Their offense shall be judged under the statutes of the Great Yin penal laws.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: After sealing the numinous register, the Orthodox Dharma disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths must assist their Dharma-master in establishing three thousand virtuous deeds, enlightening celestial and human beings, and cultivating fields of supreme merit, thereby attaining the true tenth rank and ascending to the position of Upper Immortal.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: The households of the Orthodox Dharma disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths who seal the numinous register shall, on the fifteenth day of the first, seventh, and tenth months—the days when the celestial, terrestrial, and water officials of the Three Origins examine and record the names of humans and ghosts to determine the registers of life and death, merit and sin—have their sealing-register generals, soldiers, officers, and troops, totaling 360,000 each, manifest visibly, encircling the palace and residence to display their might, defend, and capture and restrain all malevolent forces.

The Seven Perfected state: Those who act thus shall find no disaster unaverted, no calamity unendured, no misfortune undispelled, no blessing unborn, no banditry undestroyed, no virtue unsuited, no evil unremoved, no spirit unrepelled, no wickedness unsubdued, and no fortune unattained.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: Should the Orthodox Dharma disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths wish to dispel disasters, eliminate spirits, and eradicate misfortune, they must strike the celestial drum thirty-six times and recite the incantation:

The Three Generals, Officers, and Soldiers of the Supreme Upper Qingwei Heaven—Qingwei Heaven—Qingwei Heaven, each numbering 360,000, shall be dispatched for [the disciple] to restrain and suppress the qi of weaponry disasters. The Three Generals, Officers, and Soldiers of the Supreme Yuanyu Heaven—Supreme Yuanyu Heaven—Supreme Yuanyu Heaven, each numbering 360,000, shall be dispatched for [the disciple] to eliminate the inauspicious qi of the Five Directions, the six harms, and the unruly qi of demonic spirits. The Three Generals, Officers, and Soldiers of the Supreme Great Red Heaven—Great Red Heaven—Great Red Heaven, each numbering 360,000, shall be dispatched for [the disciple] to eradicate the qi of plague, pestilence, weaponry disasters, water and fire calamities, and all afflictions, thereby ensuring their immediate annihilation.

For [the disciple], they shall muster their might, mobilize their forces, and establish layered defenses—each layer comprising 360,000 troops—fortifying the residence with encampments on all four sides and eight directions, ensuring strict vigilance and protection. This is done in accordance with the decrees of the Supreme Most High, the Jade Emperor, the Great Dao Lord.

The Seven Perfected state: Should the disciple’s household be gripped by fear, encountering ominous lights, strange apparitions, or demonic influences, or if the family suffers from various disasters and misfortunes, or if neighboring households bring harm through mutual destruction, or if dreams at night are unsettling, or if there is dread of plagues, floods, fires, bandits, or any who seek to inflict harm—all such afflictions shall be addressed by reciting this incantation. The calamities will vanish instantly, and you shall be safeguarded, remaining untroubled.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: When a Dharma Master seals and consecrates the Spirit Register for the disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths, they must strictly adhere to the procedures and rituals of transmitting the Mysterious Register, presenting the memorial in proper order. Once the memorial is presented, the Dharma Master and the disciple shall stand facing each other—north and south—before the sacred altar. The Dharma Master shall then recite the names of the generals and soldiers of the Spirit Register, and the disciple shall repeat them aloud. After the disciple has received the register, the Dharma Master shall empower the register with incantations and seals, subsequently sealing it with the chapters of the Supreme Three Origins. The Dharma Master shall then bestow the Spirit Register upon the disciple, who shall bow deeply before the Dharma Master, declaring: "I, [disciple’s name], a disciple of the Orthodox Dharma of the Pure and True Dao, hereby pay homage with nine prostrations."

The Seven Perfected state: The sealing of the Spirit Register, the submission of official memorials, and all related procedures must adhere to the rituals of transmitting and administering the register. There shall be no deviation, save for minor adjustments in the wording of the chapters.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: After receiving the Spirit Register, the disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths must not engage in robbery, plunder, or collusion with malevolent individuals, nor allow such persons to enter their households. Should they violate this, as registered disciples under the jurisdiction of the Heavenly Officials, they shall be subject to the Three Punishments of the Nine Capital Laws.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: After receiving the Spirit Register, the disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths must not profane the register with impure qi or show disrespect toward the spirits. Violations shall be judged under the laws of the Nine Dark Realms.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: The disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths shall place the Spirit Register above the main hall or household entrance to suppress all unruly and inauspicious qi of the myriad spirits.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: The disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths must not treat the Spirit Register with contempt. Violations shall be subject to the same penalties as the Nine Capital Laws.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: The disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths must not discard or abandon the Spirit Register in another’s household. Violations shall be judged under the laws of the Three Punishments for disrespect.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: Whenever the disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths enter or exit their households, they must meditate upon the divine images, envisioning the generals and soldiers arrayed around their residence, never forgetting their presence. Thus, disasters shall vanish instantly, and the spirit’s qi shall remain ever-present.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: The Three Generals of the Upper Realm stand 3,600 *zhang* in height, their forms resembling vajra, wielding the Nine-Colored Summoning Spirit and Eight Slaying Spirit Staffs of the Jade Emperor. They ride three-colored poisonous dragons, suspended in the void of the Great Emptiness a thousand *zhang* above the earth, leading their troops. Through their divine power and mysterious descent, even if a hundred blades pierce the heart, all malevolence shall be dispelled in an instant. The disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths must always envision them thus.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: The Three Generals of the Middle Realm stand 3,400 *zhang* in height, their forms resembling those of the Upper Generals. They wield the Seven-Colored Divine Tiger and Great Slaying Spirit Staffs of the Nine Heavens, riding creatures that ward off evil. Suspended five hundred *zhang* above the earth, they lead their divine troops in mysterious descent. Even if a thousand poisons assail, all wickedness shall flee. The disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths must always envision their forms thus.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: The Three Generals of the Lower Realm stand 3,200 *zhang* in height, their forms identical to those above. They wield the Three-Colored Divine Gold and Demon-Subduing Three Slaying Spirit Staffs of the Three Heavens, riding creatures that guard against inauspiciousness. The generals hover five *zhang* above the earth, while their officers and soldiers stand upon it, their presence enveloping the entire household from above and below. Leading their troops in mysterious descent, they drive the five directions’ plagues, pestilences, and poisons into uninhabited lands, annihilating demonic spirits and ensuring the peace and prosperity of the household. The disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths must always envision the forms of these spirit generals and soldiers thus.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Three Heavens decrees: The Orthodox Dao gives rise to the Orthodox Dharma; the Orthodox Dharma gives rise to the Orthodox Teachings; the Orthodox Teachings give rise to Orthodox Awakening. Once the disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths have entered the Orthodox Unity Dao, they shall transform others through the Orthodox Dharma without coercion, thereby aligning with the proper path of the Heavenly Disciples.

The Seven Perfected state: "Transforming without coercion" refers to the Dao’s wondrous and formless origin, which wondrously responds to the Great Void. Its true emptiness is the utmost emptiness, and the utmost emptiness is the utmost Dao. It transcends the subtle and the true, beyond the reach of human intellect or wisdom. It points to the Great Void, which is itself unfathomable—how much more so the utmost Dao? The Dao’s wondrousness lies in its wondrous non-being, and from this non-being arises its natural efficacy, bringing forth this great existence.

Thus, the summation of wisdom constitutes the numinous, and the summation of the numinous returns to insight. This may be called the wondrous center of great illumination, wherein natural and orthodox wisdom arises. Orthodox wisdom is none other than the Orthodox Dao. Its operation stems from inherent efficacy, and its transformation arises from spontaneous function—hence the Four Symbols serve as its foundation, the most wondrous of the wondrous. Therefore, it stands supreme above the myriad Dao; what need is there for coercion?

The Perfected Great Saints of the ten directions’ heavens all revere and bow their heads in homage, calling themselves disciples. Even the Celestial Perfected and the Great Numinous Ones of the Supreme Emperor act likewise—how much more so the celestial and terrestrial beings, how much more the earthly spirits, how much more the ghosts and gods, who would not desire to take them as masters? Once the Orthodox Transformation has set its pattern, what need is there for coercion?

Those who bow their heads before the Dharma Master are all disciples of the Pure and Orthodox Dharma. Having called themselves disciples, they may be said to have achieved transformation without coercion—this is already inherent within it.

The Orthodox Statutes of the Jade Bureau of the Three Supreme Heavens state: After the disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths receive the Register of Numinous Spirits, they shall not conspire together to forge weapons, plot against the rulers of their dwelling lands, rebel against the imperial sovereign, or deceive heaven and earth.

If a Dharma Master hastily reissues the Register without the disciple observing the fast, both the Dharma Master and the disciple shall be judged according to the Three Punishments.

The Orthodox Statutes of the Jade Bureau of the Three Supreme Heavens state: If disciples of the ten directions’ heavens and earths encounter disasters such as war, flood, fire, or other calamities and lose their Register of Numinous Spirits, they are permitted to approach the Dharma Master to receive the Register anew without the labor of fasting. If the disciple does not seek reissuance, they shall be judged according to the Nine Punishments of the Dark *Nüqing* Statutes.

**Preface of the Seven Perfected of Golden Clarity**

The Orthodox Dharma is none other than the Orthodox Dao. Thus, it can illuminate awakening to the point of Great Awakening, ascend to Orthodox Awakening, and enter Wondrous Awakening—truly the utmost of the wondrous. The subtlest profundity of the wondrous, the most wondrous of the subtle, how can it be discussed in terms of words or images? Unless one is a Mystic Sage, who would dare to point beyond forms and guide within them?

The Register of Numinous Spirits originally derives from the transmission of the Supreme August Jade Emperor of the Primordial Beginning of the Utmost Supreme Three Heavens, having come from the kalpas without end. It has always been practiced during the final kalpas, emerging into the world to deliver beings, relieving suffering during the *yangjiu* and *bailiu* catastrophes, and preserving all without harm. Thus, the transformation of the Dao Lord is not for His own sake.

Moreover, the Orthodox Teaching is truly like a compassionate mother, ever mindful of her children, just as a skilled physician treats illness—how could it not be effective? Yet the Dharma of worldly salvation is like this. The sentient beings of the Three Realms dwell amidst afflictions, hardships, and calamities, their lives like flickering lamps—how can they know their suffering? They may speak of joy within it, but I observe the deluded masses and see that they are truly not joyful. Their years and lifespans pass like lightning, ultimately sinking into the Eight Difficulties, drifting through endless kalpas, enduring the Five Poisons, and suffering the Ten Torments in the dark prisons—what joy is there in this?

Before their bodies have perished, they witness the turmoil of the world, unaware of impending disasters and wars—how much more so when their bones have already sunk into the depths? This may be called the compassionate teaching of the Perfected descending to illuminate the dark paths, dispelling the obscurity of the Nine Nights, opening the gate of wisdom’s mirror to illuminate the beginnings of the unenlightened masses, enabling them to penetrate the Six Insights and awaken without obstruction.

May the living secure auspicious harmony for their households, and the deceased ascend to transform in the heavens, their spirits roaming freely—thus ensuring the peace and preservation of descendants for generations to come. Such is the true teaching of this sacred register, by which the multitudes are protected and delivered from the Five Turbidities, and the Three Calamities and Six Harms are kept from afflicting their bodies. Its power can regulate the movements of heaven and earth—how much more so the ghosts and spirits, that they should not perish or fade?

Yet only the Supreme Three Heavens’ Jade Bureau of the Orthodox Dao possesses such majestic numinosity, for these are the natural spirit-generals. The divine soldiers are likewise—only we believe in them; how could the common people awaken to this truth?

Here ends the *Supreme Three Primes’ Spirit Register for Pacifying the Household*.
