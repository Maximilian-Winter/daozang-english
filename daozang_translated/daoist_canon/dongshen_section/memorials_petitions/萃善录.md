### **Collected Auspicious Records, Scroll One**

#### **Prayer for the Sovereign’s Birthday**
The Sage is born—auspicious lightning flashes from the purple pivot of the North Star;
The August Lord descends upon you—joyous clouds part along the Yellow Dao.
With reverent solemnity, we present our words; at dawn’s first light, we make our plea.

We humbly recall that the ancestral seal has been newly transmitted, and we have journeyed afar to behold the imperial court. Fragrant incense was bestowed upon the Dragon-Tiger Altar, where we received the Supreme Decree in person. Yet in the Hall of the Qilin, where we would offer birthday felicitations, we have not yet turned our carriage southward. Thus, we command the masters of the Mystery to perform the purification rites, that we may face Your August Countenance and return due praise.

We devoutly pray that the green missive may ascend by night, summoning the immortal host from the Pure Capital; that the vermilion palace may bask in vernal warmth, and Your Majesty’s great foundation of blessings endure forever.

#### **Prayer for Rain**
The earth is spread as an altar, and the soil becomes jade;
Gazing at the clouds, we beseech the mandate of Heaven, and it rains pearls.
Life’s vitality is swiftly restored, yet the Primal Work claims no credit.

We humbly recall that since we took the name of the Dao, we have awaited the farmer’s fullness. In all our labors, from dawn’s toil to dusk’s rest, we have cherished the hope of spring planting and autumn harvest. Yet this year, severe drought has struck, unlike times past. From the suburban altars to the ancestral temples, we have prayed long; would that the seedlings might flourish by morning or evening! But the people, burdened by grain transport, grow weary. Should famine descend, how shall the year be sustained? Though the divine response was not distant, frost and mist arose instead. We return the numinous waters to pacify the spirits, and offer libations to repay the root.

We devoutly pray that Your bounty may be bestowed in full, preserving these years of plenty. From the third day onward, let the rains become a deluge, their beneficent waves spreading ever wider. May no one fail to receive its grace, and all alike return to the land of joy.

#### **Prayer for the Celestial Master’s Return from the Capital to the Mountain**
The Sovereign’s command brooks no delay in departure;
Yet we are barred from gazing upon the limpid light, though it lies but a footstep away.
August Heaven shows no partiality, its wondrous workings unfolding in both inquiries of the Mystery.

With reverence, we seal incense in the imperial capital and return to present our memorial at the ancestral altar. We humbly recall that our blessings derive from hereditary endowment, and we have presumptuously inherited the ancestral seal. Yet our words and deeds are fraught with remorse, and we have often transgressed the teachings. Family misfortune and fate’s perversity have brought repeated calamities. Fortunate to live in an era of dragon-soaring governance, we have been summoned to court by post-horse relay. Who would have thought that a minor recovery would stretch into half a year’s confinement? Longing for the imperial favor of an audience, we have strictly observed the purification rites of the Numinous Treasure, seeking to repent our faults and dispel disaster, to pray for grace and beseech the mandate.

We devoutly pray that the imperial heart may hold us in esteem, and human desires be fulfilled. May it perceive our private repentance and bestow the gift of life’s creation. May the true wind blaze resplendent, deepening the vermilion screen’s favor; may new blessings abound, and the purple-sealed decrees fall like heavy dew. May all who cherish their destiny be encompassed by Your grace and protection.

#### **Prayer of Thanksgiving for the Fire-Averting Rites**
In the *gengwu* year, a dream in the spring of the vast heavens:
Before the Hall of August Felicity, an apparition appeared. Then, at the Bamboo Pavilion, a soul returned, declaring that its chamber would suffer fire. The Pavilion’s master, moved by long-standing concern, vowed to perform the rites, and peace was restored.

Dreams are interpreted as dreams, for ephemeral visions hold no certainty. Yet to doubt is to transmit doubt—how dare we ignore the lessons of the past? In former times, we sought blessings; now, we repay kindness. We humbly recall that if one seeks the preservation of even a single tree, one must fear sleeping upon kindling. The transformations of butterflies are too myriad to fathom, and those who hear of them harbor hidden worries. How much more so the uncertainties of deer and moats, where loss and gain may hinge on chance? Caution is paramount. Thus, on account of these dim and inscrutable omens, we have sought peace and tranquility. The August Lord has shown compassion, and we yearn to repay His favor.

We devoutly pray that the initial covenant may be fulfilled, and the final grace be granted in harmony. How could we ever forget? May we forever bear the gift of wind and rain’s protective grace. As Heaven commands, may it secretly align with the hearts of our ancestors and the incense fires of our lineage. May virtue spread like spring’s sunlight, and grace bathe the boundless expanse.

#### **Prayer for the Celestial Master’s Rites of Thanksgiving for the Completion of the Canon Hall**
The Dao’s mechanism knows no rest, and thus it gazes upon the extraordinary court.
The Dharma Treasury is newly completed, truly dependent upon the Mystery’s creation.
Thus, we celebrate with a single rite and beseech the host of perfected beings.

We humbly recall that we have turned our thoughts inward, examining ourselves and reflecting on our faults. Some arise from past causes bearing present effects; others stem from our own inadequacies, which invite manifold errors. Some grievances of the heart remain unrecognized; some hidden transgressions go uncorrected. Some, by fate’s station, encounter solitary stars; others, in the palace of descendants, turn their backs on auspicious constellations. Such deviations have brought us to this pass—how may we repent and be absolved?

We declare that the construction of the precious canon is a testament to the efficacy of divine intervention. Moreover, the banners of the perfected stand in solemn array, capable of turning the heavens through their revolutions. Fortunate in human skill’s accomplishment, we aspire to the sagely brilliance that fulfills desires. With solemnity, we present our humble offerings, reverently revealing our sincerity.

We devoutly pray that Your August Countenance may shine with clemency, and spring’s vitality arise in Your virtue. The workings of creation know no pause, transforming and communicating in the turning of a wheel. The Eight Trigrams congeal the spirit, revealing the six children of Heaven and Earth. The three yang forces burst forth in splendor, reversing adversity and prosperity in a single moment. The mandate is bestowed by Heaven; we await grace this very day.

#### **Wu Weide’s Prayer for His Deceased Mother**
On the road as a traveler, the sky seems distant, and the wanderer’s heart races in vain.
At home, the clouds linger over the mountain peaks, yet the face of my compassionate mother remains unseen.
I bow to the Mystery’s teachings and knock at the gates of the Pure Capital.

I humbly recall that my studies in immortality were shallow, and my service to my mother was lacking. I had thought that, like a tumbleweed, I might yet return to repay the joy of beans and water. Who could have foreseen that, like drifting duckweed, I would return only to shed tears upon the *lai* robes? What benefit is there in a single son leaving the household? Yet the ten directions’ deliverance from suffering is no falsehood. As the day of mourning arrives, I humbly initiate this special rite.

We devoutly pray that pearls may float upon the lion throne, and jade be kneaded into the dragon script. May the carriage return from Penglai, awakening her from the dream of emptiness; may she attend the banquet by the Peach Pool, ascending to the realm of bliss. May her soul and spirit find their way, and her descendants be truly blessed.

#### **Prayer for the Establishment of the Rites for the Nine Dark Realms**
No being can foresee the future—grief strikes as a minister is torn away.
Yet this sorrow cannot be stilled, so we beseech the August Lord to grant ascension.
Our words fail, and our tears of blood flow unceasingly.

We humbly recall that our father’s frost-white hair came too soon, and the jade-like purity of the swallow—what enmity did it bear? Who would have thought that, though toothless, it harbored such deep venom? A mere injury to the finger has brought immeasurable sorrow.

Would it be that his descendants avoid untimely fate, or is it rather that his own life was bound by destiny? His loyal heart, ever radiant, cannot silence the sorrow of this world; his noble example, vast and enduring, may yet console the hopes of those beneath the Yellow Springs. Though humble water-cress may be offered, the mirror of the gods remains impartial. We humbly beseech the opening of the Gate of Liberation, that the path to the Void be revealed, ancient grievances melt like ice, and no reckless thoughts arise from delusion. May the departed soul ascend like clouds, its essence refined through the fruit of goodness, and may it follow the true Dao, guiding posterity by its virtue.

**Prayer by the Immortal Maiden for Her Parents**
Father, what shall I rely upon? Mother, whom shall I depend on? Alas, the eternal separation from those to whom I return. Heaven provides the beginning, Earth nurtures life—may the work of creation begin anew. With three bows of dark jade, nine prostrations of utmost sincerity, we beseech.

We recall that though the youngest daughter has found her place, her parents cannot be redeemed. In gratitude, she offers sacrifices and praises their virtuous teachings, which benefit others; in vigilance, she honors their memory, ashamed of her own meager deeds. Her eyes, like mugwort, shed tears for the times; her heart, like grass, stirs with thoughts of remembrance. The bright water is set forth in full, and the grace of the divine waves is truly relied upon.

We humbly pray that the Great Potter’s wheel never ceases, that the All-Seeing Mirror shows mercy. May the light of Earth’s Dao and the radiance of Yang revive the withered form of the mother-plant; may the harmony of human destiny and the mysterious unite to fulfill the private longings of the sunflower and bud.

**Annual Prayer for the Establishment of the Rites to Honor the Mother**
O Mother, who nurtured me—how endless is the pain of parting! The first anniversary of mourning has come, yet the passage of time, swift as a white colt, offers no respite. Clad in mourning white, my grief ascends to the vault of heaven.

We recall that since suffering the sorrow of Lady Lu’s fate, I have endured the return of the stars to their stations. Contemplating the unfathomable rise and fall of life, I take solace in the rites of deliverance. With reverence, I purify my dwelling and solemnly welcome the divine chariot.

We humbly pray that clouds part to reveal the Yellow Dao, that winds carry the green petition. May the decree summon the Three Realms to carefree wandering, and the myriad immortals descend in attendance. May her compassionate light reach far, illuminating the sincerity of my observance; may the dawn of tomorrow’s audience leave no childish plea unanswered.

**Sun Qiubi’s Prayer for Universal Deliverance to Fulfill His Vow and Honor His Late Master and Ancestor Lu Zijian**
Recalling his former guidance, I vow that if a promise is made, it must be kept. In this act of universal deliverance, I think of him as if he were present, that he may fittingly ascend. Daring not to renege on my word, I venture to address the celestial hearing.

We recall that bodily affliction brought suffering, and the illness showed no remission. In haste, we appealed to Heaven, and by grace were granted a temporary reprieve through a single offering. Yet with no ground left for revival, we suddenly realize seven years have already passed. Though the departed are distant, the promises made remain; what the heart knows, the spirits record. Thus, we earnestly fulfill our vow, hoping to emerge from darkness.

We humbly pray that the Great Dao, ever compassionate, and the Perfect Truth, boundless in scope, may point the way to Penglai’s path—perhaps returning by the Weaving Maiden’s route—or enter the grain of millet to partake in the joy of celestial beings. May the merit of this round completion enlighten both the living and the departed.

**Chen Zhishuai Huang Nie’s Memorial Prayer**

In the Green Forest, bandits were quelled, and ripe wheat allowed the troops to rest. On Black Ridge, immortals nested, and sacred thatch was purified for the Emperor’s rites. The jade caskets’ statutes were strictly observed, and the jade altar’s ancient ceremonies solemnly performed.

We recall that, though unworthy, we were entrusted with pacification and suppression. We held that humanity is Heaven and Earth’s most precious, and could not bear to destroy life. Yet if rebels leave the sovereign and father with sorrow, they are called traitors to the state. Thus, we personally led the soldiers, capturing the ringleaders alive. Though we returned in triumph, we could not avoid indiscriminate killing. We repay the aid of the wind’s rustling and cranes’ cries, and show the benevolence of weeding to let the seedlings grow.

We humbly pray that the cosmos may turn toward harmony, and all strife and suffering dissolve. War is a fearsome instrument, used only when unavoidable; may the grievances of bleached bones be wholly dispelled. Serving the public good, we know no restraint in action; may the depths of our sincere hearts be clearly seen.

**Memorial for the Three Courts**

**Late Memorial**

Cool breezes rise in the medicinal halls as the fifth month of summer brings wind’s warmth; incense ascends the sacred altar, where thrice-daily audiences lengthen the day. The celestial might is near at hand, and we extol the radiance of the sovereign’s virtue.

We humbly recall our undeserved favor, leading troops through campaigns—barely easing the siege at Tingjian, then gathering strength at Hongqian. As an anthill burns to ash, we fortunately delivered the ringleaders in cages; the dragon countenance brightened with joy upon receiving the courier’s tidings of victory. Now, assembling at the united peaks, we reverently ascribe merit to the imperial court.

We pray that august Heaven may protect Song, restoring the old borders of Zhou, renewing all transformations, that sovereign and ministers may rejoice in harmony, and the five weapons lie at rest, multiplying the realm’s gladness.

---

**Palace Gate Memorial on Locusts**

The willows of the encampment at Xiliu are newly cleared, ending years of banditry; the white poplars mourn the graves, yet cannot summon the souls of the long-night dead. We perform rites in blessed precincts, offering earnest prayers to vast Heaven.

Reflecting on the uprising in Ganzhou, where the dead lay thick as hemp: those bound and executed hastened their own street executions; those who broke ranks and charged bore grievances of the wild grasses. In our judgment, we acted to save the people, trusting the emperor’s aid to crush the rebels. Killing was not by choice, yet lives were saved without end.

We pray for a great amnesty in dark prisons, universally liberating suffering souls. May the five regions’ diverse customs transform weapons into plows; may the Three Dynasties’ shared ethos merge chariots and script in rites and music.

---

**Palace Gate Memorial on Locust Plague**

Fields of abundant grain stretch unbroken, promising a rich harvest; yet swarms of locusts invade, gnawing and bringing disaster. This concerns the people’s lives, and thus the emperor’s heart.

We recall that the lands south of the great river, long called a land of joy, have seen borderlands briefly at peace, spared urgent military demands. Yet Zhexiang’s poor harvest has already strained official granaries. We had hoped for a bumper autumn, to preserve the lives of the many. Now, this great locust scourge fills every village; we, mere ant-like ministers governing the realm, can but weakly order captures in the fields and earnestly perform exorcisms to the heavens.

We pray that Heaven may pity all beings, absolving myriad sins, sweeping away the winged pests, and encouraging the gods of the state’s fields. May the precious harvest hang heavy for reaping, bestowing joy upon the farmers. Our vows are urgent; we await swift grace.

---

**Prayer for Clear Skies at Xianying Temple**

We had hoped for rainbows, but were granted only mist; the lingering clouds refuse to disperse, deepening our worry over floods. Gazing upon the people of Zhe, dwelling in their lands—these encircled fields of watery realms—we see that though rain falls often, the seedlings fail to bloom. The river’s tides gnaw the banks, and lake waters rise to engulf homes. As marshes grow stagnant and damp, illness threatens to fester.

The Son of Heaven bends his thoughts in concern; his ministers strive for peace and stability. We solemnly prepare the altar rites, reverently presenting our memorial.

We pray that Heaven and Earth may open wide, the sun’s radiance shining forth. May the three seasons of farming proceed, completing summer’s toil for autumn’s harvest; may the thousand-mile realm flourish, ensuring the people’s well-being.

---

**Preparatory Prayer for Clear Skies at the Bright Hall**

Sovereign of the state, child of the people, continuing the great unity of the primordial origin; father of Heaven, mother of Earth, revering the ancestral sacrifices of the Three Ages. We gather for the fast and offer prayers in advance.

We pray that the autumn skies may clear, the jade candle of time burn bright. May the Supreme Emperor send blessings, completing the rites in the grand hall; may the young ruler succeed to the throne, his great foundation flourishing ever more.

---

**Prayer for Rain at Xianying Temple**

The people are weary, having lost spring’s planting and autumn’s harvest. Heaven speaks not, yet the sun shines daily without rain. We deeply reflect on our governance’s failings, humbly presenting our distress.

We recall the canal defenses’ lack of success, our return yet unfulfilled. Meteors streak the daytime skies, repeatedly foretelling drought in the wilds; the fiery season’s qi presses urgently upon the water fields. Though we have prayed at all shrines, we seek only the Supreme Emperor’s mercy.

We pray that clouds and thunder may descend, filling ditches and furrows. May the planting of grain proceed, granting a bountiful harvest; may jade unite with pearls, displaying Heaven’s auspicious signs. If our officials have erred, we beg punishment upon ourselves.

---

**Second Prayer for Rain at Xianying Temple**

The farming season is lost, the drought severe as scorching flames. Heaven’s ear is near, yet our trust remains unanswered, bringing no blessing. Thus, we cast aside weariness and knock upon the bright heavens.

We recall the two capitals’ granaries, where solitary loyalty serves the state. Expenditures double, yet funds are scarce; undeserved honors should be relinquished, yet we remain. Zhexi and Zhedong, lands of grain, pray for abundance; the summer’s plum rains, once hoped for, now wither the earth.

Shamans and markets alike fail to move human effort; lightning and dragons respond only to Heaven’s command. Having performed rites by the lakeside, we pray for abundant rains to revive all.

We pray that the proud sun may be restrained, and sweet rains bestowed. May water plowing and fire weeding swiftly proceed in the fields; may grain rot and coins flow, aiding the state’s stores. We hope for a moderate harvest, averting further calamities.

---

**Prayer for Rain on Behalf of Maoshan**

The year’s harvest nears, yet requires moisture; autumn’s sun scorches the sands, worsening the drought. Here, where immortals and sages dwell, the common people offer prayers.

We recall our unworthy appointment to this sacred office, overseeing the auxiliary capital. At this time of many concerns, we hope for a single good harvest. The season of harvest approaches, yet the fields suffer from dry hardness. From the nearby suburbs to distant frontiers, a thousand *li* of land share the people’s year-end anxieties. The Emperor surveys the four directions—can he bear to cut short these lives? As the drought spreads through our jurisdiction, we fear the blame rests solely with this humble minister. Truly, we tremble without rest, hoping our sincerity may reach above.

We pray that virtue’s blessings may spread universally, benefiting all beings. Pity these toiling people, long laboring in the fields; send abundant rains, that the year’s work may not be in vain.

---

**Prayer to Avert Fire at Kaiyuan Palace**

Meteors fall in daylight, warning Heaven’s high clarity; flames spread from house to house, grieving the people’s displacement. With solemn sorrow, we address the azure vault.

We recall our futile service, leaving families barely intact. The springs’ flow is blocked, already harming the people; fires rage unchecked, repeatedly burning empty storehouses. Yet Shangqiu’s sacrifices endure, and the Song state’s blessings are boundless. Thus, we perform the rites of libation, reverently invoking the jade-like deities.

We pray that great benevolence may be bestowed, silently averting disasters. May the vast capital rest secure, the warm winds stilled; may the spring fields receive nourishing rains, hastening the plow.

**Prayer to Avert Warfare**

The mountain caves, devoid of reason, breed the bandits of the greenwood; the borders we guard bear the deep sorrow of our people. With reverence, we lift our gaze to the vast heavens and solemnly present our perilous plight.

We recall the years of governing this land, when our borders enjoyed peace. Yet neighboring raiders spread their poison, swiftly turning roads to ashes; the wicked lurk like rats, their treachery stirring within our very walls. Heaven struck down their rebels, yet daily warnings still rush in. The royal palace was breached, and our outposts suffered grievous losses. Our forces, though poised to crush them, have yet to achieve decisive victory. Pleading for the people’s lives, we humbly beseech the Emperor to accept their surrender. We pray that one region’s transgressions be pardoned, sparing countless lives. May misfortune shift with the heavens’ will, and our armies’ might be bolstered by their early triumph. Let their ringleaders be destroyed, offering slight solace to the innocent dead. May the fields and villages be pacified, and all know the mercy of sparing life.

**Prayer for the Emperor’s Heir**

Facing south in court, long has he succeeded to the great lord’s throne; as heir, he should inherit the blessings of a son. Repeatedly, we have offered prayers to the azure vault, awaiting divine response within the palace. Now, at the Hall of the Supreme One, on the destined hour of the Lower Prime, we command the Daoist priests to reverently present their vermilion petitions. We pray that the Emperor’s heart may turn to safeguard the nation’s lineage. May the signs of prosperity converge, and the bows of succession be bestowed. Let the joy of the pepper chambers be fulfilled, as the peach and the gourd’s legacy endure.

**Memorial for the Ninth Depths Ritual by Minister Zhang**

The toil of a mother’s virtue is vast and hard to repay; her sorrow pierces the Dao of Heaven, which responds without fail. Thus, we perform this pure ritual, reverently pouring forth our sincerest devotion.

We recall our late mother, whose noble conduct was embodied in her person. Among seven children of the same generation as my late father, she nurtured and embraced us with loyalty and filial piety, her grandchildren thriving through three generations. Her compassion was boundless—her kindness extended to neighboring states, and even the simplest meals brought comfort to our humble chambers. Her life was cut short by the misfortune of her orphans; her frail form seemed lost to us. Our repeated pleas only deepen our grief. Respectfully following the jade tablets’ decree, we now present this green petition.

We pray that her merits be acknowledged, her errors forgiven. May the wind rise in the white poplars, not waiting for the tomb’s closure; may the fire pass along the golden thread, swiftly ascending to the Land of Bliss. May her grace extend to the Yellow Springs below, and its blessings overflow to all around.

**Prayer for the Five-Seven Ritual by the Minister of Justice**

A woman’s path is to grow old with her husband; when he dies, my sorrow is nearly unbearable. I raise the dust-covered desk in self-pity, composing this petition to submit above.

We recall my late husband, who had barely received his first official post when he lost his parents. Grief clung to him like a shroud, and as he prepared for distant days, illness struck at the graveside. He perished in his prime, leaving our household in anguish, a calamity worse than any other. Our orphaned children have no support; to whom can my bitter weeping be heard? We pray that your divine gaze may look upon our sorrow, pardoning our transgressions. May his soul be guided to the land of the living, where he may still recognize his kin. May I, a widow, and our weak children forever dwell in the shelter of the Dao.

**Prayer at the Yellow Register Ritual at Yulong Palace by General Chen**

As I take up my duties anew, the greenwood bandits remain unquelled; moved by the times’ many troubles, I perform the Yellow Register Ritual. I have personally come to the hall of blessings, where the sacred altar awaits. My heart is loyal to the throne, though my hair is white from war.

The Fujian region has lifted its alert, thanks to the harmony between ruler and people. Yet as I move my post to the Jiang region, famine and hardship have repeatedly struck. Is this due to the people’s accumulated transgressions, or the cruelty of corrupt officials? Reverently, we perform this ritual at the abode of the immortals, hoping to turn the heavens’ and earth’s benevolence. We pray that the jade candle burns evenly, the pearl treads its proper path. May the Emperor’s life be firmly secured above, and all living things preserved below. May the mountain rebels be pacified, sparing our troops from prolonged campaigning. May the fields yield abundant harvests, granting the people and officials a fleeting peace.

**Prayer for the Return of the Celestial Master as the Patriarch’s Protector**

Gazing north, we imagine the wild geese bearing letters from the patriarch of the Mystic Gate; looking east, we pray to the true spirits of great creation. The response should not delay, and the report must acknowledge its source. We recall our own cultivation, though our conduct is not our own. At the edge of the teaching’s reach, we have done our utmost to uphold it; beyond the passes, we now face separation. We have repeatedly sought blessings to implore Heaven, and by its grace, we have reached this day. This is no mere fortune—how dare we take our vows lightly? With solemnity, we prepare the primal altar and reverently perform this pure ritual. We pray that the nation may restore its old ways, and the Emperor’s favor renew itself. May the rain of teaching nourish the Dao’s mountain in nine streams, and the star of longevity shine upon the three tiers of the celestial platform.

**Prayer for the Celestial Master’s Stay in the Capital to Establish the Annual Scripture**

The days’ remainder, the years’ remainder—by fortunate light, we have reached this time. The state must prosper, the family must prosper—we seek blessings for all. With gratitude and prayer, we tread carefully, as if before the sacred. We recall that in our court, the Emperor’s sacrifices extend far, his heart ever constant. Though years pass, his virtue is not forgotten; though the heavens conceal the Dao’s lineage, his grace welcomes the new. Reverently, we present our offerings, silently conveying our devotion like sunflowers turning to the sun. Our inscription cannot repay this debt; only your bright gaze can perceive our sincerity. We pray that great creation bestows its benevolence, and the imperial capital enjoys harmony. May all life thrive as one, and every door welcome the spring’s auspicious air. May both public and private life flourish, and the post stations swiftly bear glad tidings. We vow to cultivate hidden virtue, looking up to answer the primal merit.

**Closing the Altar**

In this world of dust, we have strictly observed the rituals at the jade altar; from the Emperor’s pure heights, the sacred standards descend to witness. The morning rites are complete, the fast’s affairs concluded. Ritual values moderation to perfect its form; its meaning aligns with the libation’s completion. We pray that the imperial spirit, majestic and serene, may observe our reverent withdrawal. May the enlightened masters clearly perceive and pardon the solemnity of our final rites.

**Prayer of Thanksgiving**

As the first yang returns, the father first seeks the eldest son in the east; as the three wishes are graciously fulfilled, the Emperor looks down upon you. Such grace, such virtue—how can we repay or express it? We recall that our humble devotion has been thorough, and the imperial spirit has not been blind. Snow first appeared as an omen, and for half a month, the skies cleared. The sun warmed like spring, and after three days, rain fell. All this was the work of the divine, as the signs of qi made clear. Moreover, our allies have stood together through peril and peace, and all officials have moved and rested in tranquility. This was not by our design—it was the Emperor’s will. How else could heaven’s timing align with human affairs? Bathed in blessings, we give thanks and pray. We pray that your gaze may open like the orchids by the stream, ever responsive to the slightest offering. May the omens sprout like seedlings, and your silent goodness answer all desires.

**Prayer for Recovery on Behalf of Another**

Illness binds hearts as one, and the weight of duty calls for mutual support. Though love may differ from kinship, sincerity seeks the shelter of heaven’s grace. The Emperor heeds words and fulfills human desires.

We recall how one has labored to open the halls of the Dao, yet the body has accumulated afflictions. Wind is the root of lesser ailments, and external causes still linger shallowly. Yet there is water that flows against the current—deep indeed are the distant concerns. No success has come from the marvels of ginseng and atractylodes. How then can one hope to ride upon grace? We pray that the fragrance of immortal ink may linger, that the elixir’s mist may disperse, that the Celestial Physician may descend to earth, and that the healing assembly may bring forth medicine. May the Star of Longevity shine brightly, and the Star of Life ascend high. Like the pine, may one never age; may every blemish be washed away, and the balm of blessings be shared equally.

---

**Preparatory Prayer for the Golden Register Grand Fast at the Mountain, Spring of the Gengwu Year**

Heaven above and earth below have entrusted the great enterprise. Famous mountains and mighty rivers are duly revered in external sacrifices. A single envoy is dispatched to reverently reach the Three Spirits. As the bells, chimes, jades, and silks are first arrayed, the ritual implements of jade tablets, bi discs, and huang pendants are all prepared. Their elegance is manifest, embodying the heart of the Son of Heaven, who unites heaven and earth. When the numinous is made clear, it becomes the foundation for the altars of state and the well-being of the people.

---

**Morning Court Prayer**

We clarify the spring decree and base ourselves in the sincerity of the morning sun. With reverent awe, we dare not neglect the respect due to heaven. Though what we gaze upon is not distant, silent understanding is achieved. We reflect: upon what do the people rely for order and peace? It is the Emperor who truly governs as their master. Heaven is high, the stars distant, yet the five planets move without error. Earth’s bounty and human harmony stabilize the eight directions, unmoving.

---

**Midday Court Prayer**

The brilliance of *li* shines in both directions, as the sun reaches its zenith again. The Dao of heaven is timely and perfect—none is greater than heaven. We solemnly dispatch envoys to perform the sacrifices, gazing toward the imperial palace to hasten the court audience. Moved by utmost sincerity, we reverently await a virtuous response. Not a single person is not his subject; heaven bestows auspicious omens, and all things fulfill their lives, each day dependent on transformation and nurturance.

---

**Evening Court Prayer**

In governing the realm and leading the people, we do not forget the vigilance of evening reflection. Dividing our mandate, we entreat heaven with ever-greater care in dawn and dusk audiences. Sealing our sincerity, we reach from afar, penetrating the Three Realms in silent communion. In the quiet of these moments, we offer our praise. May the state’s principles be perfectly ordered. We still hear the songs of Yao’s lands; the imperial standard is without bias, and great blessings are bestowed according to the *Ji Chou* decrees.

---

**Main Offering Prayer**

The altars of state face hardship, and we have presumptuously inherited their foundation. The sacrifices to mountains and rivers—how can we repay the lofty deities? We consider the many perils of the land and measure the difficulty of being a ruler. The people have endured danger and distress; famine years cannot avoid displacement and ruin. Without the power to turn back heaven’s will, how can the state endure? We dare to lodge our sincerity in this single offering, hoping to avert calamity through the Three Spirits. May we be enlightened to the signs of the times, and may a modest peace be shown. May the roots of the state be revived, and great prosperity’s omens unfold. May the people be nurtured and settled, and order and peace be gradually achieved.

---

**Preparatory Prayer for the Emperor’s Birthday, Ren Shen Year**

As the month of his birth approaches, we measure its beginning with silent reverence in our hearts. In awe of the vast heavens, we solemnly repay our origins through external sacrifices. Thus, we dispatch envoys bearing offerings, perform the fast at the immortal altar, and observe the five rites, praying in accordance with the proper forms that the Three Spirits may take notice. The virtue of the sagely wood flourishes, carrying forth the heart of nurturance and growth. As the dawn of the next day approaches, we present the offerings and proclaim the purpose.

---

**Morning Court Prayer**

Rising early with utmost care, we offer the initial sincerity of our sacrifices to the Emperor. Restless in our duties, we place the people’s well-being first. Entrusting ourselves to the mysterious rites to seek the mandate, we reveal the heart of the Son of Heaven. Embracing benevolence, we reflect: it is the Emperor alone who is mindful of this. With five winds and ten rains, we achieve the abundance of the middle way. Across the four seas and nine provinces, the resources for modest peace are sufficient.

---

**Midday Court Prayer**

When the sun reaches its zenith, it turns back—truly, the warning lies in fullness. Heaven’s hearing is most near; who can ensure its steadfastness? The state stands with its people, and the times are ripe for action. Bearing golden tally sticks, we pray for grace; shouldering cinnabar tablets, we serve the mandate. May heaven grant its favor, further opening the omens of prosperous reign. Following the ancestors’ path, we teach the great peace of the state.

---

**Evening Court Prayer**

As the day wanes into night, we dare not grow lax in court ritual. The foundation of the state lies in the person—we have presumptuously inherited the bright mandate. Now, as the time of the initial offering arrives, we humbly initiate the modest rites. Is there no desire to seek abundant blessings? We pray that the silent gaze may be fixed upon us. The characters of "longevity" are vast—how can we repay such great grace? We personally follow the words of the Dao and, in the end, humbly entreat. We swear to embody the responsibility of acting on heaven’s behalf.

---

**Main Offering Prayer**

As the sun reaches its second zenith, we have presumptuously shared in the spirit of mountains and rivers. Heaven has no constant favorites; it silently bears the weight of the imperial enterprise. Moved by the times, we issue commands and pray. In dense forests, we rise early and retire late. Recently, winter has followed the decree of spring—who will establish the people’s standard? The concerns are not merely drought, flood, illness, or plague. Reflecting on the state’s principles, how can we fulfill the responsibility of cultivating the self, ordering the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to the realm? The manifold proofs gather upon our person. Thus, we perform the solemn external sacrifices, praying that the Three Spirits may grant their protection. For those who have land and people, our aspiration is for stability. For the state and the family, may we personally witness the effects of great peace.

**Preparatory Prayer for the Emperor’s Birthday**

Three days bring renewed weather, marking the beginning of the imperial birthday. The eight wildernesses open into a realm of longevity, ensuring the perpetuity of the mandate. Fragrant mists swirl in the empty air, and the true wind unfurls. Now, the golden envoy bears the water-hearted sword, erects the jade altar, and hangs the pearls of millet. We humbly initiate the modest rites, reverently awaiting the imperial consideration. We pray that the Three Realms may dispense grace, and the myriad immortals may descend to witness. May the nine-five blessings be longevity; may the nine-five blessings be wealth. May the vast realm become our home. Eight thousand years shall be spring; eight thousand years shall be autumn. May we endure beyond antiquity, never aging.

---

**Court Prayer**

The sagely ruler’s intelligence and clarity shine forth, as the rainbow flows on the day of the Upper Third. Fragrant offerings move the spirits, and the turtle and milfoil extend across the heavens. We welcome the imperial envoys from the blessed land, solemnly presenting the golden register to entreat heaven. Bowing our heads to the red clouds, we offer our sincerity in blue-green prayers. Reverently, we pray that the stars may shine, and the sea’s moisture may open the way to longevity. Before the Three Palaces, may the mountains stand tall as the sun rises. May the people of the nine lands be nurtured.

**Further Prayer**

The Dao of Heaven is revered; we reverently seal incense in the blessed land. The imperial heart holds us in its regard; we pray for the imperial house to receive divine favor. Bowing low, we present the green memorial, offering it to the profound gaze of the unseen. We pray that though distant, it may be as if near, attending to high and low alike. May no inquiry go unanswered, and good responses abound. May yin and yang harmonize, and wind and rain arrive in due season. May governance be effortless, ministers virtuous, and the common people flourish.

**Prayer for the Heavenly Calendar to Bless the Sage**

As the Son of Heaven acts on behalf of Heaven, at the outset of his succession, the appointed time draws near like lightning. We offer our prayers in advance for blessings. May this be an era of peace, where weapons are laid aside, and the black-haired people return to benevolence. May armor and blades be washed clean as garments, and the signs of great peace endure. May the sun and moon shine brightly, mountains and rivers stand majestically, and the emperor’s longevity equal that of Heaven.

**Prayer for the State Ritual at Mount Yanzao**

Heaven bestows the Nine Categories, guiding the realm to ascend to the realm of longevity. The state conducts the Seven Sacrifices, ascending the central peak of the famed mountain. Gazing upon the golden gates, the four quarters are stabilized; aligning with the jade balance, the seven celestial bodies are set in order. All this arises from the hidden efforts of the people below, sincerely manifesting the heart of the August Emperor above. We pray that the eight directions be united and at peace, the Three Palaces gain longevity. May Heaven and Earth be level, the primordial qi upright, enabling all things to be without flaw. May yin and yang harmonize, and the harvests be abundant, bringing fortune to the One Man.

**Morning Court Prayer**

Bathing in the Salty Pool, emerging from the Valley of the Sun, the crimson sun displays its nine rays. Pushing open the gates of Heaven, entering the imperial abode, we behold a single cluster of red clouds. Donning the night robes, we await the dawn, as the warm breath of spring returns. From afar, we present the incense of state affairs, awaiting the bestowal of policies for peace and governance. We pray that fortune uphold the precious throne, and blessings fill the celestial palace. May the dragon tower be comforted, and auspicious omens be praised within the crane precincts. As yang divides from yin, the Two Modes are established; may the imperial plan endure for a hundred million generations. As autumn’s virtue brings forth the myriad treasures, may the black-haired people of the eight directions be enriched.

**Midday Court Prayer**

As the sun reaches Kunwu, the zenith is perfectly attained, and the image of fulfillment is complete. The wind-borne chariot ascends directly, and memorials are presented in words. The golden bells fall silent, the jade balance follows its course. We exhaust our devotion, and the imperial heart holds us in its regard. We pray for the imperial way to be grandly unfolded, and civil virtue to flourish. May the Six Treasuries and Three Affairs be justly governed, establishing a foundation of great prosperity that endures. May the Four Seas and Nine Provinces be as one, sharing in the joy of effortless rule.

**Memorial for the Proper Offering to the Great Yin**

The radiance of life unites with virtue, moving the supreme essence of Heaven’s Oneness. The suspended image descends in spirit, carrying the universal moisture of the earth’s center. The vast true creation, the subtle divine mechanism—before them, I, humbly observing the waxing and waning, follow the Dao. The Palace of Broad Cold is pure and still, its lofty abode adorned with the Seven Treasures. The bright water’s fragrance aligns with the great function of the square mirror. To achieve the wondrous alchemy of ninefold rebirth, one must rely on the surplus of a single drop of golden waves. Together, we look to the moisture descending below, nourishing all things in their turn. Responding to Heaven and form, the Dao and appearance must align with the completeness of creation. The moon is the po, the sun the hun; they do not transgress the bounds of yin and yang. The refining and molding depend entirely on this—we know where to return.

**Memorial to the Heavenly Worthy on the Ninth Night of the Ritual for Lonely Spirits**

The Jade Treasury seals the covenant with the true, lifting the lonely souls from the Nine Earths. The Precious Flower responds to the invocation, verifying the fruits of the Dao across the heavens. Gazing upward, we soak the imperial hearing; looking down, we rely on the fast and offerings. Together, we look to the Jade Capital to nurture excellence, the Jasper Towers to send forth fragrance. Adorned with the myriad treasures, we look up to the Brahma qi of the Woven Net. The Nine Heavens illuminate, opening the dark paths of the gloomy thoroughfares. May souls cross the Crimson Mound, and blessings flow to their descendants.

**Yellow-Edged Proclamation to Welcome the True**

The six tubes float in spring; the first yang returns. The nine gates are guarded at dawn; the ten thousand sages arrive as one. At the time when the yellow altar awaits the imperial favor, when the purple qi heralds the beginning, we shall reverently clear the path, gazing upward as the True descends from the void. The Milky Way shines and turns; the divine qi moves beyond wind and thunder. Heaven and Earth are bright and discerning; the imperial robes flow with the light of sun and moon. The hundred spirits of the realm rise to attend the vanguard. The jasper altar and crimson standards long await the ranks of the alchemical registers. The jade table and red clouds once more witness the assembly of the pine and flower.

**Proclamation at the Gate of Supervision**

The Dharma gate is vast; how could it distinguish between near and far? The imperial abode is pure and lofty; if one does not stray, it is as if close at hand. Let there be reverence and stillness—why not return? Ask not who the child is, nor say the body is a guest. The myriad wonders are not wondrous; here, the mechanism of tranquil non-action is revealed. The supreme words are wordless—how could there be deeds too lofty to perform? Come, let us together behold the millet of the immortals. Truly, there is no wind or rain. The Penglai Isles are purified; following them, one easily attains the body. The dusty world is boundless—where does one hasten? When one arrives at home, the mysterious barrier is straight and direct. Here, in this hall, is the entrance. The divine and bright are diligent in vigilance; the ordinary and sacred return as one.

**Proclamation of the Heavenly Physician**

The world’s greatest suffering is that of the poor, who are afflicted with many illnesses. Why does Heaven allow this? The medical Dao silently governs. Even when wandering souls transform, there is the intention to lift one’s head and cry out. Thinking of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor, their lofty abodes in the Nine Heavens are hard to inquire of. Like Qin Yueren or Bian Que, their life-giving qi endures through a thousand generations. The Jade Emperor’s supreme medicine, the three-grade elixir of gold and jade, the ninefold return that mends creation and aids yin and yang—possessing divine qi yet leaving no trace. How vast is Heaven’s law of the Dao, ever inclined toward nurturing and healing pain. Do not say ghosts are not human; beyond the work of divine and sagely craftsmanship, they assist that primordial transformation, aiding our fast’s merit.

**Proclamation for the Ritual Bath**

The poet sings of the Jade Maiden’s basin, meant only for washing the hair. The fisherman answers the grandee: this water is but fit to wash the feet. Neither is wholly good—do not follow their example. For the inversion of yin and yang in Kan and Li holds great power. Moreover, in the heaven and earth formed by the one and six, the qi is first received. Those who drink it know its warmth; those who scoop it find its coolness endless. This is called the ritual bath, fully arrayed in its form. Autumn enters the lungs and liver, the five viscera; it sprinkles the dew of the golden stem, chilling the hair and bones. A single flask immerses the ice of cold jade. Facing it, dust and grime vanish of themselves, enabling both form and spirit to attain perfection. This is not like spring’s end, when one returns singing from the Yi River, nor like sighing at Huaqing, emerging from the warm springs to receive the gift. Freed from the self—who is the one washing?

**Monitor of the Students’ Register**

When the Great Ultimate first divided, Heaven and Earth were established, and the Six Offspring arose. The primordial qi dispersed and divided, yin and yang intertwined, and the myriad forms took shape. Yet none is more noble than humankind, for we are endowed with spirit, serving as the heart of Heaven and Earth. Who, then, holds the handle of creation? The loveliness of orchids and thoroughwort springs from the reverence of the ten thousand spirits. But when one sits in the grass and vanishes like a cloud—if even a single thought arises to sustain them—beyond that support, they remain bound like a melon to its stem, unable to restore the fragrance of a frozen valley. The ranks of officials are orderly, their transformations traceless. You know the dream of old—regard it thus. The magic mushroom has no root; here, you may fathom the manifold wonders. The peach blossom, greedy for its fruit, teaches one to blame the east wind in vain. Be pure, be free, and ever wakeful—go forth.

**Monitor of the Fasting Hall**

Millet and sorghum are not fragrant—I have heard these words. Though the sacrificial grains be impure, the officers listen in silence. The Dao of Heaven and Earth shines clearly; the feelings of ghosts and spirits are utterly transparent. Without sincerity, no offering is accepted; by virtue, recompense is due. For though the petals be arrayed in full, even pine blossoms are not spurned. If fragrance may be presented, then even water plants and algae bear no fault. Yet fire from labored wood may cook a meal, but how dare one offer a feast of dust and soot? Moreover, the Sage’s teaching warns: "Do not eat what is improperly prepared." If the stench of raw flesh offends Heaven, how much more the exalted Lord? Thus, if we would not profane purity, by what means shall we illumine and serve the gods? Only you, the worthy, who have made your merit manifest—do not neglect your duty. The richness of the Dao is not a matter of taste; why seek the discernment of Yi Ya? The food is ready to be tasted—let not the stain of Zigong’s finger mar it. The cloud-kitchen must be kept pure, that the heavenly rank may rise.

**The Water-Chestnut Enclosure**

Erect the water-chestnut enclosure to welcome the wandering souls—once in a lifetime, twice in an age. Arriving at Penglai, one hears the wondrous Dao—across a thousand years, the reunion is profound. The years fly like a shuttle; youth fades like spring’s blossoms on the trees. How many days does a life hold? The north wind stirs the sand, and the withered branches howl in the cold. Your journey, too, has been arduous. All under Heaven are brothers; this gathering is of immortals. Long ago, the Dark Master pointed the true path through the hidden pass. Now, the Lord of Teachings once more spreads the compassionate ferry across the sea of suffering. By what cause or karma have we gained this expedient means? Life is what I desire; righteousness, too, is what I desire. Fortunate to encounter the fish and bear both at once—does the noble lord it over others, or the lowly? Do not imitate the clam and snipe locked in strife. Snowflakes melt to moisten the lips; clouds gather to cleanse the heart. The flavor of the Dao is enduring; the seeds of goodness reveal themselves. Heaven is vast, Earth is broad—why should the night rain trouble one’s grievances? Yin reaches its extreme, and yang returns—another message of spring’s breeze.

**Register of the Lonely Spirits**

Zhuangzi once said: "Having received a completed form, that form must one day perish." Ruan Jian argued there were no ghosts, yet ghosts proved otherwise. Thus we know the inherent nature of the two qi cannot be dismissed by a single path. The tales of Boyou and Peng Sheng—did the ancients deceive us? The wrongs of Weiqi and Guan Fu—are the trustworthy histories not as they say? From life to death, from ancient times to the present, the gardens of Jingu—how could there be no song and dance here? The flowers and trees of Pingquan—how many have lived to see them? The river of descendants flows ever eastward, while the sun sets in the west. The widowed, the orphaned, the solitary, the childless—among the common people, many are those without recourse. Some perish from plague, others die young or in darkness. Half of those whom Heaven has stripped suffer a thousand hardships, beset by poverty and sickness. How many sighs can they bear? In the end, all return to nothingness. Without a master to make offerings, they are called lonely spirits. Yet now, by good fortune, they encounter the Yellow Register Fast of the Daoist Office, which has specially initiated this wondrous rite. They are filled with food and never hunger; warmed by clothing and never cold. The thirty-six sacred scriptures and good karma—have they not received the twelve thousand golden tablets? The spirits of the dead shall all ascend to the paths of immortals and buddhas, fully capable of entering the gates of Heaven and the gates of men. All may depart from the Yellow Altar, turn their heads, and swiftly ride the pure winds of Penglai. Their names are recorded in the Cinnabar Palace; in time, they shall all enter the Millet Pearl and the Azure Vault. Rejoicing greatly, they shall soon transcend.

**Register of the Generals and Officers**

Cloud-script fills the Great Void; the Dao is made manifest through writing. The divine qi of wind and thunder resides in the heart. Moreover, the light and mountains scattered between Heaven and Earth share a single principle with the union of Heaven and humanity. Lord Lu became a thunder spirit; Fu Yue rose as a constellation. General Li, though he never received a noble title in life, must surely rank among those whose honors ascend with the stars. Zhang Suiyang, who vowed to kill the enemy even in death, will surely rouse his unfinished heroic heart. Though the essence of the Dao arises naturally, its function in the law must be strategically employed. The jade terrace rises from the earth; the jade carriage gazes upon Heaven. The golden tablets seal the tally; the treasure books open the lock. By these means, the numinous wind is spread and the sun of wisdom shines forth. By these means, the lost are guided back and the bewildered cross the ford. In the darkest depths of the Nine Netherworlds, even a single inch of the cinnabar heart brings light. Silent accord lies in the Dao; the noble transformation does not rely on the spirit. Without performing good deeds, how can one attract auspicious omens and attain the joy of the immortals? By assessing merit and bestowing rewards, one may ascend beyond the ranks of Heaven.

**Register of the Ritual Sequence**

Fasting is for serving the Emperor—it must proceed from the root. The Dao of culture is not distant from humanity; how can there be a guiding principle without its details? We, the officers of the Yellow Altar, are none other than the court of the Purple Palace. In orderly ranks, we earnestly instruct: our words become the law, our actions become the model. Act as though the Lord and Father stand before you. What is spoken, what is written—know that immortals can be learned. Walk the full circle within the compass; turn within the square of the carpenter’s rule. Do not say you see nothing, hear nothing. What fault lies in punishment? A single miswritten character in the *Huangting* script brings error. No transgression can be concealed on the Gengshen day—what fear is there of the Three Corpses? Let us swear our alliance to Heaven, bright as the sun.

**Tea Register**

I ask: the magic leaves of the sea—has their radiance not soared to the Milky Way? The auspicious herbs of the mountains—has their fragrance not mingled with the sweet basil? By their rare merit of the highest rank, they draw in the finest qi of the gathered blossoms. Consider the Heavenly Master, who inherited the Han lineage: his vessel was prepared with the root of immortality, his Dao profound and subtle. The water of the middle cauldron is clearly seen; the tender buds flourish thickly. Not to mention the unopened buds of Mengding, the purple orchids and fragrant cassia they depend upon, the vermilion grasses and fine grains that attend them. A gentle thunder cracks the pod, awakening the benighted. The moon shapes them into cakes; their crystal brilliance stands alone. One sip measures the capacity of all; together, they suffice for discourse. The tongue’s root stirs in secret; the green banner is unfurled. Pressing on to Penglai, the clear wind fills both sleeves. Holding the green jade tablet, one attends the morning audience; joy reaches the ninefold palace. Slowly, the sun rises three yards high; leisurely, the five thousand characters advance. Fine lines naturally link in the stone tripod; noble names rise again from the golden bowl. White snow fills the cup, flowers linger—briefly, the fragrance graces the tip of the nose. The benevolent wind silently gathers pearls; buds early restore spring to the palm. Nodding, one steps forward; the heart is steeped and offered.

**Wine Edict**

Upon the yellow altar, sweet wine is set; the great potter’s wheel turns, and the solitary yang is born. In the dark pavilion, cups fly; the grand rites are complete, and all blessings gather. Bamboo and pine stand as if drunk; gibbons and cranes welcome in joy. Together we revere the Heavenly Master, whose cloud-qi is as venerable as the udumbara. Amidst the sacred mountains’ tripods and cauldrons of this enlightened age, harmonious black nectar flows; from the immortals’ palace, auspicious mists and fragrant winds arise. Raising the gourd, one pours the celestial brew—spirit transcends the mundane. Pausing the cup, one questions the bright moon—elevated thoughts remain unstained by dust. Merging with the division upon the cauldron of Qingzhou, permeating the subtleties within the jade scepter’s yellow core, one sinks into the intoxicating savor of the Dao’s flavor, steeped in the grace of the immortals’ breeze. A heart brimming with profound reflection ferments a full measure of joyous blackness. Passed among men to be extolled, why speak of a thousand days’ rare fragrance? Summoned by the Son of Heaven, one would yet intoxicate the ninefold palace with spring’s hues. One imagines, as the phoenix-side banquet concludes, the vermilion edict inscribed, the imperial gift of yellow-sealed wine bestowed upon the saddle. Tapping the jade pot, one envisions the Daoist minister’s heart as clear as ice; pointing to the golden stem’s dew, one smiles at the immortal palm’s congealed pearls. The rich, dark flavor deepens; the fragrance of roses draws near.

---

**Water Lantern Edict**

Water lanterns mirror the water, unfolding into lotus blossoms that face both heaven and earth. The sky’s reflection dries the heavens, illuminating the empty isle of Penglai. The nine abysses know no night; a thousand torches float upon spring. Crow and hare yield their radiance; seated by the sea, one communes with the Silver River. Fish and dragons blow waves, racing across the platter—one suspects they are luminous pearls. Yet this single golden light resides entirely upon the tips of the lords’ brushes. With sand-wrapped millet, why summon the soul of Quzi? As waves birth flowers, one may recite the verses of Su the Immortal. Where this lingering brightness reaches, even the hidden depths of the earth return to light.

---

**Universal Deliverance and Covenant Edict**

The precious moon regains its fullness, the jade axe at last stilled. For nine nights, the spring wind stirs, and the golden statutes are revealed. Solemnly, no dust-borne steeds take flight; lightly, no immortal chariots leave traces. Five difficulties are resolved in emerald order; three obscurities are dispelled. The ten directions float in emptiness, yet a single pearl gathers all. Within lies the spontaneous workings of creation, here extending deliverance to the hidden and dark. Crane messages dawn in clarity; dragon patterns rise with the clouds. In reverence for the distant and the departed, one presents the sincere heart of self-purification. To escape suffering and ascend to truth, one gazes upward to the wondrous Dao of deliverance. Now is the time; Heaven indeed attends.

---

*Collected Virtues, First Scroll Concludes*
*Collected Virtues, Second Scroll*

**Li Clan’s Solemn Establishment of the Nine-Yin Ascension Rite for Deliverance of the Deceased Husband and Descendant Spirits: The Principal Invocation of the Orthodox Offering**

Life and death are vast indeed—rites of celebration and mourning mark their bounds. With fasting, purification, and ablution, Heaven and Earth attend. Already, the golden tablets have bent to grace; now, with jade rites, we humbly offer thanks in clarity.

We recall with reverence: how shallow our portion of Heaven’s favor, how fleeting the kindness bestowed upon this handmaiden. In two years, seven bereavements—husband lost, then child, then grandchild. One body weeps for three generations. Daughters perished, grandsons followed; strange maladies arose, suspicions of lingering affliction. The divine trembled in wrath, calamities pressed without cease. This body dared not rest in ease; this heart knew its guilt.

We have purified ourselves, crossing the Six Paths to dissolve transgressions. Yet how much greater to prostrate in sincerity, to invoke the sacred peaks and plead for deliverance. August Heaven looms above; the bright waters declare themselves.

We pray: may the Dao’s life-giving spirits show mercy, may benevolence forsake no being. Through the ninefold refinement of immortal rites, may they be moved to unseal the gate of liberation. May the human realm be renewed, forever sealing the path of hidden suffering. May the day of grace dawn, and accumulated virtue repay Heaven’s debt.

---

**Preliminary Invocation**
The Supreme Emperor’s boundless compassion ever fears estrangement from the human way. Though all mortals must die, the true rites of salvation endure to aid all beings. Yet in old age, how could one lose both sky and earth’s support? Those long departed—who will open the ground of their rebirth?

Thus, with a heart of cinnabar sincerity, we reverently prepare the jasper altar. The five winds stir gently, fortunately upholding the mystic norm; the nine gates of cloud part, permitting dawn and dusk to enter the pure radiance.

---

**Morning Invocation**
The virtue of cherishing life is vast, moving the exalted sages to cast their light. The heart that honors the distant is enduring; we solemnly begin the morning audience and plead for deliverance. The sun’s qi bridges the meeting of Heaven and humanity; yang brightness communicates the mechanism of creation. The three realms commune in spirit; the nine springs rejoice. Jade texts spread across kalpas, guiding the way for immortals; golden tablets flow with cinnabar, sealing the sincerity of mortal pleas.

---

**Midday Invocation**
Rising early to serve the Emperor, the devotion of fasting remains incomplete. Approaching the court at noon, we lament family hardships too deep for words. External misfortunes have struck, bringing inner grief and mourning. All day we examine our faults; we repent our calamities before Heaven. Blocked paths now open in silence; the Northern Dipper severs the road of hidden suffering. Radiant clarity shines through; the Southern Palace raises the liberated souls.

---

**Evening Invocation**
The autumnal palace at dusk reflects the many hardships of human life. The morning rites extend into night; child-readers chant their subtle verses. The Dao opens the light of the hidden earth; virtue pours forth the nourishing dew of its surplus. May it aid the departed and bless the living. Heaven’s decree and human fate align—may we gather the twilight of the elm’s shade. May the sun’s glory flourish in posterity, ever more lush than orchid sprouts.

---

**Invocation to the Perfected Lady for the Thirty-Seventh Generation Celestial Master, Master Xīwēi**

Alas! This disciple journeyed afar, only to die as a stranger and never return. Yet Heaven’s wisdom is keen; it pities the voiceless sorrow of the people. The door stands empty of hope—thus, the true words of the invocation begin.

We recall with reverence: so-and-so, having inherited the teaching for three years, packed his belongings and traveled ten thousand *li*. By the grace of his ancestors, he met with fortune; yet stricken by lingering illness, how suddenly he perished. The heart breaks at the arrival of letters from afar; the spirit grieves for the traveler’s shroud. The bond of mother and child, the vastness of life and death—we turn in devotion to the ancestral teaching, first sweeping clean the household.

We pray: may the four qi shine clear, may the five texts open wide. The North cannot be dwelt in long—may the Emperor dispatch the Three Summons. The Eastern Limit delivers boundless beings—may the scripture be transmitted ten times over.

---

**Second Day: Morning Invocation**
Dawn’s light is desolate; no robes bow before the mother. Mortal sorrow is poignant—we rely on letters to cry out to Heaven. The solemn presence of the ten directions and three realms descends; today begins the second day’s six audiences.

We pray: may yang radiance shine universally, may imperial decrees be issued. May the wandering soul of the northern wastes be permitted to follow the melting snow; may the immortal register of Penglai be inscribed, allowing transcendence and ascension.

---

**Midday Invocation**
The sun stands at its zenith; the brocade of day’s return is torn. Yet the spirit remains as if present—we raise incense of fragrant herbs in reverence. The cries for a lost child are mournful; the longing for Heaven is urgent.

We pray: may the Jade Heaven stir to action, may the Golden Gates dispense grace. May the great courtyard of flowing fire open wide, utterly dissolving all past stains. May they enter the ministry of the Supreme Mystery and achieve transcendence.

---

**Evening Invocation**
The hour of night’s settling arrives; the eldest son is no longer seen in the bedchamber. The evening audience of the rite proceeds; the assembled sages still attend the altar. We strictly adhere to the teachings, manifesting reverence before the lofty firmament.

We pray: may the night’s qi be serene and clear, may the celestial perfected guide the ascent. May the soul be delivered—may its wish for eternal freedom be fulfilled. May mother and child find connection, perhaps meeting in dreams.

---

**Third Day: Morning Invocation**
The forest greets the dawn sun; sorrowful, we watch the crow return to feed its parent. The altar gazes toward the vast sky; with pardon in mind, we think of the phoenix ascending at sunrise. Bathed in fragrance, we return to the command and prostrate ourselves to beg for grace.

We pray: may the gates of vastness open wide, may jade tablets enter the audience. Mindful of the descendants of Yangping, may they be attached to the immortal ranks. May they receive the true transmission of the Jade Bureau and personally hear the supreme Dao.

---

**Midday Invocation**
The sun’s light stretches long; grieving the divergent paths of south and north. Heaven’s majesty is close at hand—how can we bear the sight of an aged mother and young child? The bright waters are offered again; sorrow runs deep.

We pray: may talismans be issued from the Jade Steps, may decrees descend from the Vermilion Mound. May they ride the feathered wind to return, briefly recalling their old retreat. May they enter the jeweled pearl and listen to its radiance, suddenly awakening to past errors.

---

**Evening Invocation**
White hair and a blue lamp—forever severed is the dream of holding a jade ring. Golden texts and cinnabar tablets—we rely on the rites of refining jade. The night’s scene is quiet and desolate; the fast’s work is complete.

We pray: may the celestial texts be gathered and spread, may the Emperor’s grace be widely proclaimed. May the departed ascend to perfection, returning the qi of Heaven, Earth, mountains, and rivers. May they expound the scriptures and transmit the Dao, awakening to the constancy of life and death, day and night.

---

**Preliminary Invocation for the Celestial Master’s Audience and Return to the Mountain, by Imperial Decree, to Perform the Golden Niche Fast**

The Emperor proclaims: with reverence, we have chosen an auspicious day to express our devotion to the mountains, rivers, and altars of the land. With rites and music, we serve Heaven, preparing jade, silk, drums, and bells in full measure. At this moment when the three realms commune in trust, we begin with solemn purification of qi.

**Invocation for the Procession of Gold, Where Earth Becomes Jade**

Where gold is put to use, the very earth turns to jade. Gazing upward, we behold the boundless virtue—how dare we falter in resolve? The majesty of cap and sandal shines forth, never straying even a foot’s length. Cloud chariots advance in solemn grace, star-canopied tents glow with radiant light. Bestowed commands converge in harmony; spirits align with fortune, seasons with their proper order. Auspicious omens descend in full: the sun’s brilliance redoubles, the moon’s clarity deepens. The seven celestial bodies align in perfect order; the five weapons remain untried.

---

**Morning Audience Invocation**

At sunrise, the hour of *yin* receives its guest, as Yao took Heaven as his model in greatness. Heaven’s favor renews its mandate, as Tang inscribed the sun’s power to ever renew. Preserving the dawn’s pure and luminous *qi*, we hold morning court in solemn reverence. The divine presence abides—may the Emperor ever bear this in mind. Gathering blessings for all beings, may he never stand alone in his august rule. May the records of the year be bountiful, not monopolizing glory in spring and autumn alone.

---

**Midday Audience Invocation**

The radiance of *Li* illumines all, as we look up to receive the sun’s twin beams. The celestial image stands high—how dare we neglect Heaven’s entrusted teachings? The divine presence hovers above, vast and boundless; the sovereign’s spirit, moment by moment, manifests its power. The Dark Ultimate receives homage; the Pure Capital dispenses decrees. The foundation of the divine realm and the nation remains unshaken, securing the Nine Lands. The customs of the capital’s counties flourish, as the four cardinal virtues bring great order.

---

**Evening Audience Invocation**

As autumn’s first breath arrives, the day wanes into evening. A single thread of sincerity stands revealed, preserving the night’s *qi* to serve Heaven. In the vast and formless, no partiality exists; in the depths of secrecy, commands are issued. Grandly upholding the ancestral way, he assists his house with devotion. The imperial carriage is not his heart’s desire—truly, he relies on the Dao of foundational aid. Seated in the Hall of Light to govern, how dare he stray from the wellspring of assisting virtue?

---

**Principal Offering Invocation**

The state is called the eldest son, like a treasured vessel held close to the body. The father is revered as the august lord—even in quietude, one seeks his command. How dare we shirk this duty? Daily, we offer silent gratitude for his support. Through ritual, words reach their mark; through sincerity, offerings are received. All people are kin, all things companions—united in the benevolence of a single gaze. When customs flourish and governance is achieved, the virtue of the Three Powers shines forth in full.

---

**Preliminary Invocation for the Thousand Autumns Festival**

Bearing the weight of great responsibility, he succeeds to the mandate of Heaven and Earth. Nurturing life in due season, he attends to Heaven and Earth with a heart set afar. Sincerity extends beyond jade and silk; reverence is perfected upon the jasper terrace. Sweeping clean the dust of the lower realm, he humbly receives the high command of the vaulted heavens. Jade wheels advance with phoenix escorts, harmonizing with the imperial progress. Golden registers open the vast origins, their evening petitions never failing.

---

**Three-Audience Invocation**

Heaven, in its trust, protects the people below. Daily, he reflects on the charge of the Eastern Palace. From dawn until the sun’s decline, he reveres the Purple Ultimate’s court. Examining himself, he finds his true nature; offering his heart, he extends his devotion afar. May the divine spirits deign to witness this, weaving blessings for the ancestral altars. In the Five Studies, he cultivates himself, diligently striving toward the realm of perfected personhood. In the Two Palaces, the brows relax, as spring’s warmth suffuses the halls of inquiry and repose.

---

**Principal Offering Invocation**

The nation’s foundation rests upon the peachwood talisman—how dare he neglect the duty of succession? In the spring of kings, he nurtures the substance of life, upholding the signs of growth and completion. On the day of birth, he sends fragrant offerings, ascending the sacred mountain to perform the Golden Register rites. Heaven’s gaze is not distant—it is as if the Emperor himself were present. Overseeing the realm and pacifying the armies, he extends his support within and without. Inquiring after well-being and attending meals, he fulfills loyalty and filial piety toward ruler and kin.

---

**Preliminary Invocation**

The palace mirrors the celestial patterns; envoys hasten with solemn urgency. The dragon-sealed decrees of the regional lords are received as altar rites commence in solemnity. Cloud-palace rains from the jade firmament wash away the dust; winds of the golden hall disperse. The Emperor’s mandate brings spring’s warmth; the nation’s sincerity is conveyed in evening petitions. Tomorrow, the ranks will assemble in perfect order for the morning audience. The radiance of the ninefold gates and imperial avenues awaits Heaven’s decree.

---

**Morning Audience Invocation**

The sun’s chariot ascends the Yellow Way as the dawn court assembles in solemnity. The immortal retinue gathers in the crimson clouds, floating above the imperial path. To convey the nation’s sincerity, we dispel the baleful influences of fire and earth. Though the sovereign’s virtue alone could turn Heaven’s course, he first seeks the Emperor’s command to establish the foundation. Stars align in *Yi* and *Zhen*, gathering a hundredfold obedience to the imperial person. The moon resides in *Jin* and *Qin*, uniting the three directions in vast fortune.

---

**Midday Audience Invocation**

Celestial patterns are calculated; the state averts omens as the Grand Astrologer records them. In the spring’s bright daylight, envoys approach the Primordial with reverence. Offering blessings is the minister’s duty; averting disaster lies within the Emperor’s power to transform. Facing the divine, we refine our words and await commands. From beginning to end, we follow Heaven’s Dao—stars do not harm the earthly realm. Auspicious signs flourish around the compassionate person; virtue eternally aids the celestial chariot.

---

**Evening Audience Invocation**

The calendar-keeper observes the stars, divining portents to report above. Serving the altars and blessing the state, we preserve the night’s *qi* to approach the Primordial. Though the *yinghuo* planet’s movements are erratic, the dark rites of *gui* and offerings can still be employed. The great net remains in place; turning the course is not difficult. The lord’s sacrificial ale flows without worry, as spring’s radiance suffuses the flowery halls. With the peachwood talisman comes fortune, stirring joy in the maple palace.

---

**Principal Offering Invocation**

Heaven is called Father, Earth is called Mother. The terrace observes the planet’s lingering and retreating paths. Heaven forms images, Earth forms shapes—the state holds the intent of sacrificial offerings. The dark model is presented in the jasper hall; green petitions ascend to the Pure Capital. Commands are issued to the stars, flowing blessings upon ruler and sovereign. A single word retreats—let not spring and autumn monopolize glory. A single *qi* resides at the center, eternally securing peace for the people and the altars. Blessings reach the sagely heirs, prosperity extends through the ancestral branches.

---

**Sacred Festival Invocation**

Reverently following the August Heaven, he is entrusted with the weight of succession. Enduring through boundless generations, he deeply reflects on the difficulty of carrying on the legacy. Measuring the first moments of his birth anew, he examines himself to serve the Emperor. Purifying the Golden Register, inscribing the jasper rites, his sight and hearing never stray. He has fulfilled the rites of approaching the Primordial; the divine oversight shines forth. Exhausting his devotion, he offers all praise. From afar, he unfurls green petitions beneath the azure vault.

We humbly pray: may the dark workings remain unforced, extending the jade calendar’s vast span. May yin and yang harmonize, wind and rain arrive in season, and all beings rejoice together. May loyal ministers flourish, all things be nurtured, and the myriad states stand firm.

---

**Offering for Preserving Life and Guiding the Departed**

When harvests fail and illness descends, he prostrates himself to examine his conduct. Honoring the distant past remains ever-present; he cries out to Heaven to plead for life. Inscribing his steadfast red heart, he disturbs the lofty divine hearing.

Reflecting on accumulated transgressions and regrets, calamity and darkness have befallen the realm. Wandering souls transform; the dead cannot be revived. Heaven’s affliction lies in having a body; the living can scarcely preserve themselves. Caught between two perils, he is gripped by anxiety and dread.

**Purification of Intent at Sacred Peaks and Prayer at the Crimson Gates**

Thus he purifies his resolve upon renowned mountains, beseeching the transmission of his plea to the crimson palaces. He observes the rites of the golden tablets and offers libations to the jade wheels. May the supreme and manifest Perfect Benevolence deign to extend threefold pardon, that the talismans of deliverance from suffering be vast, and escape from suffering know no other path; that the virtue of cherishing life be all-encompassing, and the prolongation of life have its source. May the family line flourish, and the grace of Heaven be eternally borne.

---

**Opening Petition for the Universal Salvation Retreat on the Bingyin Day**

Embodying the heart of Heaven and Earth, he grieves for the three springs and mourns the nine nights. Approaching the realm of immortals, though a thousand *li* distant, he conveys a single sincerity. The primordial covenant is first pledged, and the green missive is presented. Reflecting that with an impartial heart he engages all things, he seeks to extend his own concern to others. He has heard that the perennial salvation of renowned mountains is universal, and this aligns with his own enduring aspiration for even the smallest measure of land. How pitiful it is that souls unremembered in sacrifice become orphaned! If they may yet attain transcendence, how could those who ought to think of their kin dare lag behind? His earlier words stand firm as the sun; his inner sincerity resonates with Heaven. Having once made a solemn vow to lead the way, how could he not personally enact a virtuous beginning? The altar’s rules are as pure as ice; the path of the assembly opens like parting clouds. May the five *qi* coalesce into truth, and the Three Spirits unite in virtue. May the mystic wind foster growth, once more inaugurating the primordial state of the Great Ultimate. May the moon of the Dao shine brightly, illuminating even beyond the deepest shadows.

---

**Morning Audience Petition**

The imperial halls glow crimson with clouds; the Yellow Springs bend to the sun’s passage. The jade steps of the immortals’ realm are arrayed in green; the ranks stand in solemn order for the dawn audience. The sun’s rays illuminate the prostrate sunflowers; spring does not forsake even a single blade of grass. The Way of renewal is ceaseless as Heaven. The bright offering arises in the East—such is this dawn. Joy is unmatched by facing south; why should these words be doubted?

---

**Midday Audience Petition**

The marvel of the Dao is depicted in the *Yi*’s "Before the Drawing," where meeting occurs in separation. Yang arises from the firm’s end, and thus we observe its return. Gazing toward the cinnabar spirits, he petitions for life; aspiring to the golden tablets, he seeks accomplishment. The three *qi* harmonize; a single light pervades all. The solar essence is refined, emerging clearly from the mechanism. The celestial nature remains unobstructed, transcending to unite with its ultimate state.

---

**Evening Audience Petition**

Cranes arrayed like stars stand in solemn ranks at dusk; dragon-script petitions float upon the gentle night air. With utmost sincerity, he serves the Emperor; expounding the teachings, he inherits the great salvific work. Beneath the lamp of wisdom, the heart’s essence is as clear as a mirror. The jade registers record merit, and once more he beholds the sun and moon of three lifetimes. The precious talismans deliver life, reopening the *qian* and *kun* of the four images.

---

**Main Offering Petition**

Thunder resounds and rain overflows, washing away the grievances of the hidden earth. Heaven is luminous and Earth discerning; the mystic gate’s beneficence is impartial. The gracious blessings secretly align; the sincerity of the retreat is fulfilled. Reflecting that he upholds the wondrous Dao and aspires to the true rites—what cannot be named is beyond ordinary names; what saves all without exception is universal salvation—he initiates a compassion as boundless as the heart, seeking to perfect the benevolence that completes all things. From the Eastern Pole, willow branches secretly sprinkle the lingering coolness; within the green millet, the yang of spring’s growth is contained. Transforming the Dharma rain to nourish all, he exhales the divine wind upon the withered and decayed. Having already manifested evident efficacy, there shall be no unredeemed souls in the hidden darkness. Though his humble offerings are meager, how could he ever repay such profound grace? May the Nine Perfected rejoice in assembly, and the One Virtue shine in harmony. The Great Dao may be sought through sentiment; when human affairs are exhausted, principle is revealed. From the heart’s origin, he dares to glimpse the wholeness of Heaven and Earth. When all things flourish, who is excluded from the vastness of *qian* and *kun*?

---

**Petition for the Universal Salvation Assembly to Repay and Transcend**

The deepest bond of mother and child once prompted prayers for healing and peace. Though the paths of the living and the dead diverge, love for the living and sorrow for the dead are boundless. One expression of gratitude, one plea; thrice purified, thrice bathed. Reflecting that his late son, of humble birth and frail constitution, strayed from the path of nurturing care and languished long in debilitating illness, he and his wife together appealed to August Heaven. Moved by the pitifulness of their foal-like child, they hoped for the silent protection of the great spirits. Yet unexpectedly, he was cut down in his prime; medicines and stones proved futile. One after another, they withered away, grieving the loss of a generation. The surviving mother cannot escape blame, and the covenant of original blessing is broken. Now, on this occasion of the Universal Salvation retreat, he seeks to aid the cultivation of the departed’s good karma. May the azure vault witness and the black registers erase his name. May the cycles of sun and moon assist the first steps of the orphaned soul. May father precede and son follow, together ascending the immortal ranks of the highest grade.

---

**Petition of the Five Perfected to Recommend the Deceased Attendant**

Heaven’s grace in salvation does not exclude the hidden darkness. When people make earnest supplications, their affairs often concern grief and mourning. With a single sincerity, he petitions and prostrates a hundred times. Reflecting that his late grandson, born in an inauspicious time and long departed, was raised in swaddling clothes to continue the family line. After coming of age, marriage was planned, yet suddenly he was lost forever. The paths of the living and the dead are now sundered; the bond between grandmother and grandson knows no end. Now that the great mourning period has arrived, he dares to solemnly present this pure offering, seeking to aid his ascent. May the Purple Palace cleanse his transgressions, and the mystic power bestow creation. May his celestial nature shine clearly, dispelling past delusions. May the Dharma rain nourish all, reaching both near and far, the withered and the decayed. May all these numinous consciousnesses together attain carefree wandering.

---

**Opening Petition by the Assembly Leader for the Nine Dark Realms to Recommend Kin**

As days pass and months come, thoughts of kin grow ever more poignant. Heaven is high and Earth is deep; the heart that honors the distant past is enduring. Seeking the Great Dao’s gate, he offers libations upon renowned mountains and presents petitions. His foolish sincerity is fitting; the master’s guidance brings completion. The jade script emits light, inaugurating the rites of the *Lingbao*; the royal writ bestows life, and the path of the Vermilion Mound remains ever open. Such unmerited grace defies repayment.

---

**Three-Day Petition**

*Qian* begins and *kun* is born; Heaven alone endures through the ages. Rising early and retiring late, he thrice approaches the audience rites each day. Relying on the immortals’ rites that perfect all things, he initiates the filial duty of repaying his parents. Humbly presenting his offerings, he looks up to answer the true banners. Only through filial piety can he move the divine; bowing in reverence, he feels shame. Considering that life is as fleeting as night and day, he reflects on where he ought to return.

**Main Petition**

The Dao revolves through the human realm, its creative power of generation without end. Gazing toward the imperial union, his reverent sincerity remains unwavering. He hastens to the immortal realm, humbly submitting his red heart.

Reflecting on the wanderer’s longing for kin and the child’s grass-like heart, he recalls the boundless grace of Heaven, which cannot restore the light of the long night. The spring rains have moistened the earth, deepening the sorrow of the Nine Springs. How can the root of life be erased? In kinship, all share the same bond. Relying on the golden tablet to emerge from the dark path and following the jade tally to open the road of life, he devoutly presents this pure offering, reverently answering the great favor.

May the Three Blacks stream forth their radiance, and the Primordial Qi initiate its course. All things return to their origin, and the Supreme Ultimate divides the heavens. Light emerges from obscurity, nurturing the Central Land. Inscribed in the heart, desires are fulfilled; virtue is cultivated to repay kindness.

---

**Petition by Sun Zhen to Invoke the Host of Former Worthies**

How can one repay distant ancestors? The source of education must not be obscured. To deliver the departed from darkness and raise them to transcendence, where else can hope be placed? With a heart of sincerest devotion, he reverently invokes the Three Treasures.

Reflecting on his late master, in life he was upright, and in death, he harbored no regrets. Yet human affairs are never uniform, and praise or blame is hard to reconcile in the mouths of many. The world is full of falsehoods, and the true heart may be obscured. Fearing his own shortcomings, he follows his humble sincerity and makes this request. Thus, he establishes the mysterious model, adorning the jade altar with purity.

May the teachings he revered and the true master of the Dao shine forth, their jade script resplendent, illuminating the gates of the Ten Grounds. May the jade chariot linger, descending from the Nine Heavens’ procession. Gazing upward, he awaits the beginning, his hope boundless.

---

**Three-Day Petition**

Rising early, he divines the day to pray for the transcendence of his departed kin. Vigilant at dusk, he serves Heaven with a heart of utmost reverence. At dawn, he conducts himself with care, for the imperial realm is pure and lofty. The master’s legacy must not fade among later generations, for the Dao’s function does not stray from a single thing. Relying on good fortune and blessings, he guides the dark journey. The golden tablet communicates with the divine, directly pointing to the land of carefree wandering. The cinnabar terrace heeds the command, joining the journey through the heavens of purity and stillness.

---

**Main Petition**

The transmission of learning depends on the master; none can fathom the depths of the Nine Springs. The Way of generating spirits reopens the beginning of the Supreme Ultimate. How could he forget the great creation that bends to perfect all things?

Reflecting on his late master, illusion gives rise to karmic fruit, for emptiness itself bears no blossoms. Gazing upon the vast and boundless sea of darkness, how could he transcend it? Yet through the expedient means of the mysterious rites, he finds a place of reliance. Gathering the departed spirits to bestow kindness and delivering suffering souls to universal salvation, the myriad knots are untied, and the three karmic roots are severed. In repayment of kindness, he offers the reverence of fragrant herbs; in observance of ritual, he pours forth the devotion of the sunflower.

May the divine lords deign to receive his offering, their boundless grace flowing everywhere. Dharmakāya and saṃbhogakāya alike point to the path of emptiness. The Dao of Heaven and the Dao of humanity converge as the return to purity and stillness. May the blessings he receives extend to his descendants, who will forever bear them in gratitude.

---

**Zhang Guoxiang’s Petition for His Father on the Final Seventh Day**

Without a father, what can a child rely upon? Alas, as a son, he has little to depend on. He laments that Heaven is too high, and the debt to his parents too great to repay. The seventh day has come to an end, and the dew-like offerings are made again and again.

Reflecting on his late father, he navigated the world with a long heart but plotted his life with poor skill. His toils were like a dream, and he longed to avoid faults but could not. Now, with rites to guide the dead, how could his orphaned son dare to lag behind? He purifies his humble abode to petition the divine and announces his plea on the dragon tablet to proclaim grace. With respect, he performs the muddy and impure rites, presenting the pure offering.

May the boundless benevolence extend everywhere, and the great creation embrace all. In response to his earnest devotion to distant ancestors, may the path of salvation for all beings be broadened. The Great Void stretches endlessly, the divine without trace. The long night is vast, yet the path of renewal is shown.

---

**Zhang Wushan’s Petition for the Return and Protection of His Daughter**

Illness is a shared concern, whether for daughter or son. No virtue goes unrequited, and no one dares defy Heaven. His foolish wish has been fulfilled, and he dares not betray the goodness of their original vow.

Reflecting on his daughter, her blood stagnated in her *qi*, and her milk congealed into paralysis. With a heart desperate for divine aid and blessings, he prayed she might not die. Bowing in gratitude for the gift of deliverance from suffering and the elimination of disaster, he rejoiced in her rebirth. Now that her fate is settled in a harmonious home, the debt of the offering remains recorded. Thus, he purifies the dusty hall and solemnly prepares the wind-borne chariot.

May clouds gather to bestow great fortune, and stars align to open the Yellow Road. May joy fill the gates, and the spring deepen the delight of the daughter’s chamber. May the house’s prosperity be fulfilled, swiftly meeting the hopes of the family. May all affairs proceed smoothly, and both virtues shine together.

---

**Zhang Zijiang’s Petition for the Return of the Jade Terrace’s Wet Nurse**

The pain of illness is unbearable, and none can replace the sorrow of a mother’s chamber.

**Zhang Zijiang’s Petition for the Return of the Jade Terrace’s Wet Nurse (continued)**

With steadfast heart, I offer prayers, trusting in the golden palace’s benevolence. The sacred edicts hold no other decree, and the efficacy of the healing rites has its source. Though my prostrations number ten thousand, what benefit do they bring to the vast heavens? Yet the divine ear is not so lofty as to be deaf to the humblest earth—thus, I humbly fulfill my vow through these rites, reverently storing the offerings within the sacred altar. Though the waters of the moat be but a drop, the Celestial Capital is not far. May the Emperor’s heart, ever discerning, grant the extension of my mother’s years.

May the warmth of beans and water repay the spring radiance of my parents’ shared old age; may the late-blooming daylily of her twilight years flourish with a hundred blessings. How could I repay such grace? Dare I forget the cultivation of virtue?

**Prayer for the Return of the Mountain Mother’s Rites**
To honor one’s kin is to honor the aged; joy and sorrow are rightly shared. The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao; the name that can be named is not the eternal name. Yet in the sincerity of my devotion, no barrier stands. Relying on heaven’s compliance with my desire, I prostrate myself in gratitude.

Recalling how my maternal mother, so-and-so, fell gravely ill, her condition as precarious as a single hair, I hastened to her bedside, fearing the day’s end would come too soon. Before I could reach her door, I cried out to heaven mid-journey. My filial heart’s wish was granted, and the Emperor’s virtue daily renewed. Dare I break my vow? Thus, I present these rites with reverence.

May her life be lengthened by the precious calendar, her years guided by the turning jade. May the daylily in the hall endure the spring’s light without aging; may the peach and plum within the gate thrive in her lingering shade. May she forever bear the weight of heaven’s grace, and may her blessings overflow like jade’s luster.

**Huangzhu Pavilion’s Director’s Prayer for the Seventieth Anniversary Rites**
The great hall’s pillars and beams rest upon a single steward; the seventieth year of life is a cause for celebration. In the reverence of this blessed land, I offer prayers for heavenly aid with utmost sincerity. May the Emperor’s will align with my deepest wish. May the days and months within the gourd preserve an ageless spring; may the mountains and rivers beyond the cauldron share the boundless flavor of the Dao.

**Petition for the Sevenfold Rites of Protection and Peace**
To trespass thrice is forbidden, yet I beg sevenfold grace; to honor the One, I devote my whole heart to repaying my vow. Entrusting my green missive, I convey my sincerity to the vermilion steps.

Recalling my service in the mountains and forests, how could heaven and earth not favor me? Yet reflecting on my past conduct, I see unfulfilled vows and broken promises. Now, as I strive to continue, I tremble at the weight of my failings—how can I justify them? Though the responsibilities of my office differ, my heart in serving the public good remains the same. How could the gods betray me? The Dao knows no division. Thus, I offer these rites in gratitude, praying the gods will see my sincerity and pardon my transgressions.

May the great creation show forbearance, and may the assembled immortals accept my offerings. May past faults be absolved, and future blessings secured; the days ahead are long. May I dwell in a blessed land, delight in a pure era, and submit to heaven’s decree.

**Collective Prayer for So-and-so’s Protection**
When illness strikes, one calls for their parents—who else could bring such urgency? The wellspring of immortality flows from our ancestors; thus, we gather to make this plea.

So-and-so of the Lü clan, born with a delicate frame amid the radiance of the womb, has dwelled in seclusion, lacking proper care. A minor ailment has arisen, giving cause for distant concern. Looking upward, I trace the source of my lineage—how could I forsake the grace of my teachers and heaven’s favor for posterity? Yet if I turn my gaze to the sustenance of life, I find the means to ensure daily peace. To seek aid from without is folly; my utmost reverence remains unadorned.

**Supplication for Divine Favor**
May the offerings ascend in perfect sincerity, and the sacred words descend in gracious bestowal. As mugwort’s fragrance rises beyond the well, may the marvels of divine medicine swiftly manifest; as orchids bloom in the courtyard, may the joy of flourishing descendants soon be seen. The cosmic order endures, and this inscription shall never fade.

**Memorial for the Completion of the Three Pure Ones Hall at Mount Wu, Presented by Master Wu in Winter of Bingyin**
Heaven and ancestors bear the weight of succession; the people and the state demand enduring protection. Thus, we ascend this sacred mountain to honor the newly established imperial shrine, offering solemn rites to convey the nation’s distant reverence. We dispatch celestial envoys to reverently prepare the jade altar. Illuminating its rituals, illuminating its scriptures, we maintain solemnity in our observances. Though unseen in heaven, unseen on earth, we present our supplications in words.

**Morning Audience Prayer**
With utmost sincerity, we perform the rites without fail. Seeking to stabilize the great foundation, we offer prayers day and night. When the qi of heaven’s vastness flows in harmony, the work of cosmic assistance endures. Cultivating virtue to align with heaven, we offer devotion wherever we dwell. As the primordial unity is preserved, the seasons manifest their cyclical passage; as the three realms commune in trust, the greatness of the Dao’s origin endures through time.

**Midday Audience Prayer**
As yang energy revives in the six conduits, we measure the nation’s governance by its ordered signs. As the nine celestial gates open to the day, we pray for the state’s foundation to thrive in prosperity. For the people embody the heart of the two poles, while the ruler bears the sole responsibility of establishing destiny. Through abundant rites, we receive unobstructed illumination. May the four seas remain eternally pure, firmly securing the golden vessel of the realm; may the three seasons bring no harm, perpetuating the harmony of the jade candle.

**Evening Audience Prayer**
Heaven entrusts the household, and self-cultivation is its foundation. Day by day, we uphold reverence, following the Dao in our conduct. Preserving the night’s qi, we present our words; observing the evening rites, we face the divine. Without a sovereign, whom would we serve? The Emperor alone considers these matters. When the inner palace is harmonized, may lasting peace govern within; when the ancestral branches flourish in obedience, may former achievements be gloriously extended.

**Primary Offering Prayer**
With humble diligence, we seek governance, and the effects of harmony are thus achieved. With unified virtue, we move the spirits, and our reverent devotion dares not lag behind. As the sacred precinct is completed under imperial rule, we, the ritual officers, present our many offerings. The clarity of Qian’s pattern demands balance; where earthly forces falter, we must seek their cause. How shall we guide the people toward flourishing harmony? How shall we bring peace to all within and beyond? The state’s principles are established—we contemplate crossing the abyss to deliver aid. Daily, we perceive the signs of the times, for heaven’s assistance lies in following its will. The unicorn’s hooves respond to the season, as we reflect on the Dao of jade-like perfection. Vast blessings flow in ceaseless grace, ever dependent on the turning of heaven’s benevolence. As the primal qi returns to its source, the image of great peace emerges.

**Prayer for the Bingmao Spring Protection Rites**
Though dwelling in a blessed land, we remain ever mindful of distant concerns. Under the sheltering clouds of heaven, we rely truly on the divine. How could we forget the time for vigilance against complacency, especially now, as the dragonflies gather and the fast begins? Like sunflowers turning to the light, we beseech the mandate; with refined offerings, we pray for grace. May the Lord of Waters take pity on our sincerity and grant eternal stability. May all remain peaceful, and the depths of the abyss prove indelible.

**Preemptive Rites for the Receding Tides, Presented by the Celestial Master**
The provincial authorities, troubled by the tides, dispatched urgent orders. My household, humble as flowing water, follows ancestral teachings in preparation. My heart adheres solely to the Dao—without heaven’s aid, how could these matters succeed? We preemptively present the pure rites, humbly beseeching vast favor. As the radiant mandate is proclaimed, we pray for the swift pacification of sea monsters. As the winds of teaching spread, may the sand barriers of old be restored. May the people’s resolve be strengthened, and the state’s foundation eternally secured.

**Memorial for the Yellow Register Rites of Wuchen Year, Presented by the Celestial Master**
We specially inaugurate the yellow altar, adhering to the celestial and terrestrial regulations. From the cinnabar repository, we present offerings to fulfill the vows of three generations and one family. Though our transgressions are few, our faith has been wanting; though we pledge reform, we still confront past errors. Yet in clarity, we find tolerance; in the unseen, we place our trust. May the Dao ever respond with goodness, turning the mechanisms of transformation within the celestial patterns. Though the sage remains beyond comprehension, may the qi of spirits and humans commune beyond the heavens. May we perceive the dawn and foresee events before they unfold.

**First Day, Morning Audience Prayer for the Sovereign**
With loyal sincerity, we answer heaven, upholding the weighty rites of the fast. At dawn’s clarity, we meticulously observe the initial audience’s ceremonies. We dare not invoke divine power for private ends but first offer our assistance in repaying heaven’s grace. May the gates of the celestial palace open at dawn, the sun warm the banners, and the treasures of heaven and earth harmonize, revealing the governance of tranquil rule. May the hearts of heaven and the people rejoice, singing the songs of disarmed peace.

**Midday Audience Prayer for the Ministers**
In answering heaven’s will, we fulfill the duties of descendants and ministers. Looking down, we stabilize the state’s foundation; through generations of good governance, ministers prove worthy. Presenting our daytime devotion to the true, we proclaim the urgent hopes of the times. May auspicious clouds support the sun, and the cold valleys exhale spring. May the jade candle align with the seasons, its harmony never straying from perfect balance. May the golden cauldron fortify the foundation, all within the realm of nurturing transformation.

**Evening Audience Prayer for All Under Heaven**
With evening devotion, we present our pure words. Having long followed the teachings, we prioritize the people’s well-being. We dare not hastily voice private requests but first hope for the welfare of all living beings. May the sun rise from the dark valley, and auspicious stars shine forth. May the Emperor pity his children, and spring’s warmth return to the cold grass and trees. May heaven turn its vast potter’s wheel, and the sun lend its warmth to the twilight years.

**Second Day, Early Dawn Prayer for the Lonely Souls**
At the dim light of dawn, we face the origin; as the sun emerges, rain glistens at daybreak. Beneath the great brightness, profound insight merges. Who pities the wandering souls with no return? Who can pull them from the sea of delusion? Only the Dao of the sacred rites offers this path—such is the Supreme Emperor’s utmost benevolence. May the sun of wisdom rise with the morning, and the divine wind arrive at dawn. Kan receives Wu, Li receives Ji—thus fire descends as water ascends. Qian provides the beginning, Kun nurtures life—thus heaven encompasses and earth fosters.

**Midday Prayer for the Primary Offering**
As the sun’s auspice reaches its zenith again, why should our morning prayers be incessant? Heaven watches from above—how dare we seek blessings in obscurity? We especially honor the departed kin of this household, who initiated the tenfold Dao of salvation. The jade texts bear witness; the golden tablets hold no partiality. May their refined essences depart from brightness, advancing beyond the spirit journey. May ancestors bless their descendants, upholding the lineage of the mysterious province. Though women too may attain immortality, they remain bound to the registers of change.

**Evening Prayer for Ancestral Offerings**
This servant divines the night—immortals of noble rank transmit their texts, while mortals hold to the common saying: "Benevolence resides in boundless love." Gazing upon the departed, whether kin or stranger, where have their spirits and souls gone? A single gesture toward emptiness, all return to purity. May the moon’s wisdom-light illumine them, their awakened nature attuned to heaven. Illusory bodies are no bodies—let them grasp the radiant root of spirit. Formless yet born of form, may they transcend the constancy of night and day.

**Third-Day Morning Prayer for the Teaching**
The sun’s rays strike the golden gate; thrice we behold the crimson clouds of dawn. Dew arrays the jade throne; once we petition the mysterious workings of spring. Guarding the teachings entrusted to us, we tremble as duty demands vigilance with the seasons. Admonishing one another in reverence, we speak with trembling awe. May we abide in obscurity yet shine, cleave to light without losing it. May the true source be upheld, the learning of cap and gown unbroken. May fresh grace descend like imperial edicts, and the lineage of hemp and silk grow ever greater.

**Midday Prayer for the Master’s Gate and Palace Gate**
A thousand years of ancestral teachings sustain the blessed land where rites are offered. The *Book of Changes*’ human culture arrays the proper positions of the household. Linked in hidden sorrow, all equally seek peace. Thrice we present our morning prayers to the clouds, heeding the returning spring as we gather records. May the sky’s light shine bright, clouds and thunder unite in harmony. May the fragrant flames of devotion burn ever high, grace flowing from above. May the branches of the lineage flourish in order, with blessings at their heart.

**Evening Prayer for Heirs**
Long have we called to heaven, hoping the mysterious lineage might find a trust. Yet all day we stand in dread—why has our earnest wish not been fulfilled? Perhaps it stems from what past lives have summoned, or what this humble self has brought upon itself. Could it be lawsuits over tombs, or some hidden curse? As this audience draws to a close, we dare lay bare our plea. May the perfected ones grant amnesty, washing away ten thousand sins to dispel hardship. May the ninefold qi wondrously coalesce, ushering the return of the single yang.

**Prayer to August Heaven**
Heaven’s records bear witness to the ancient yellow threads of covenant; dew-like sincerity is secretly offered, along with this servant’s crimson heart of devotion. We answer delayed blessings, lay bare our feelings, and await fate’s decree. We recall our youth, lost and adrift, trembling as if cast into peril. Half a lifetime’s earnest intent remains unfulfilled, while a single thread of posterity’s sorrow weighs heavily. Though parents are gone, their wishes endure; we examine ourselves and know this in our hearts. Circumstances linger, yet silently we trace the cause. The divine hosts stand in solemn array—how could retribution be unrelated? If we were to consume these words again, what punishment could we refuse? A thousand transgressions we repent; three petitions we offer as one. May you graciously pardon all without omission, deign to grant what we rely upon. The Emperor’s boundless love sustains all things in their becoming; this servant dares not speak further, yet secretly harbors this offering in the heart. One day, we shall know gratitude and repay heaven’s accumulated goodness.

**Prayer to the Three Heavens**
Urgent is our cry to heaven—can words be cast aside and trust abandoned? Auspiciously we divined the day to repay blessings with fasting rites. May kindness extend to the manifest and hidden, may scrutiny reach the subtle and concealed. Where there is completion, there is response; where there is goodness, there is no refusal. We aspire to summon blessings, vowing to broaden our practice of hidden virtue. Grant us our wishes, and we dare not extinguish the good within our hearts.

**Prayer to the Eastern Pole**
The sacred statutes were first established to fulfill past vows. Ascending together with the departed luminaries, we bow to the renewed mandate. The sagely work is impartial; the human Dao is reborn. The borrowed radiance of auspicious light is no private favor; the vitality of life flows without trace. Siblings share alike, each according to their measure, long or short. Each has its own form and appearance—what intent did creation ever hold?

**Prayer to the Earth, Southern Pole, Northern Pole, and Nine Dark Realms**
The Emperor’s fasting rites rescue those who wander the long night. This servant, with a foolish heart, answers the vows of former times. The Dao encompasses all norms; grace reaches the nine springs. Only by aiding the dead can one extend life; only by delivering the hidden can one bring fortune. May goodness spread without limit, all ascending to the lofty vermilion palace. May wishes be inevitably fulfilled, awaiting but the turning of the great potter’s wheel.
