Beholding the myriad realms,
Traversing the mortal world,
Radiant light manifests numinous power,
Revealing form through transformation.

Nine gong nine wu,
Nine gong shang gong,
Shang gong gong gong,
Nine gong nine wu,
Nine gong shang gong,

He si he si.

The triple realms’ void,
The ten directions’ myriad spirits,
All bear boundless grace,
Securing peace for ages eternal.

He si he shang,
Gong shang yi si,
He jiu gong gong.
*Passing sound*

Virtuous works accomplished,
The Great Clarity’s vow fulfilled,
All beings ascend to peace.

Six gong chi gong,
He si he,
Si shang yi si si.

*Hymn to the Azure Heavens*
In the vastness of Great Luo beyond the triple realms,
Brahma-qi suffuses the cosmos, revealing celestial patterns.
Demons and specters hide in silence, evil forces dare not intrude,
The majestic myriad dharmas forever resound in clarity.

Chi yi chi gong liu gong chi,
Gong chi yi si he gong chi,
Si he si si yi chi si,
Gong chi yi si he gong chi.

*Music of the Dark Heavenly Thearch*
*Welcoming the Immortals*
One qi divides,
Two modes settle,
In the realm of tranquil joy, the Sage’s birth is met.
Grasping the pivot of fate,
Riding the currents of transformation,
Wondrously unfolding numinous blessings,
Universally subduing demons to purity.

He si yi,
Yi chi yi,
Chi gong wu liu gong chi gong,
Gong liu yi,
Chi si yi,
Liu gong chi yi,
Yi chi yi si he.

*Again*
Gazing upon the Sacred Body,
Jade countenance appears,
Phoenix eyes, dragon brows, a face like the full moon.

Veiled in the Purple Empyrean, nurturing inner refinement,
Forty-one kalpas pass—
The might of demon-quelling spreads far and wide.

*Again*
Essence of Li and Kan balanced, evenly governed,
Bestowing blessings upon the people, aiding the world.
Golden tablets inscribed, jade caskets sealed,
Divine transformations resplendent,
Manifesting in the unseen, universally bestowed.

*Again*
The Terrace of Seven Treasures,
Glorious titles proclaimed,
The great Dao towering—office of prime counsel.
Palace of True Felicity,
Jade trees in solemn array,
Primal purity’s radiant joy,
Auspicious clouds alight on Jade Clarity.

*Again*
The Northern Culmen revered,
The Dark Sage’s throne,
Black banners, tortoise and serpent—all in guard.
Guarding the Kan Palace,
Dispelling evil spirits,
Hair unbound, feet bare,
True qi soars through the Nine Heavens.

*Again*
Within the sacred realm,
Brahmanic qi ascends,
The Ten Poles in solemn array—myriad forms in homage.
Golden gates unbarred,
Jade records descend,
Grasping creation’s pivot,
The Dao’s true power boundless.

*Again*
The Dao’s law flourishes,
The Sage’s traces shine,
Riding the cinnabar palanquin, bearing the jade chariot.
Nine qi preserved,
Myriad dharmas unfold,
Roaming and subduing,
Spirit-demons manifest their numinous might.

*Again*
The Sage’s transformation made manifest,
Meritorious deeds fulfilled,
Waters surge, great bells toll, vast timbers float.
Guarding the Ninefold,
Extolling transformation and nurturance,
Lifetimes of protecting the realm,
Sheltering the people with endless blessings.

*Step by Step Higher*
Gazing upon the Dark Power,
The Dao exalted, virtue wondrous.

*Joining Heaven and Earth,*
Expanding and contracting in radiant clarity,
The measured tones ascend and harmonize—
Revolving primordial qi.

Great Clarity’s lush canopy,
Adorned with the Three Luminaries,
Illumining the Five Wefts,
Myriad Perfected and Sages,
Mounting feathered chariots,
Harnessing the whirlwind,
Spreading grace and light,
Blessings vast and boundless.

*Drunken Immortal’s Joy*
The Purple Empyrean’s Great Tenuity gleams with the turning jade mechanism,
The Golden Register unfolds the Cavern of Truth,
The jasper tome proclaims the sacred scripture,
In a flash of flame, the ten thousand spirits part.

The Purple Throne welcomes the Emperor’s chariot,
Ethereal, soaring through the purple mist,
Riding the auspicious gale,
Approaching to govern the pivot of transformation.
Revealing numinous power,
A single sincerity silently shines,
Trust and resonance ascend to the Supreme Mystery,
Dispelling calamity, bestowing abundant blessings.

In mutual joy and celebration,
Eternally reliant on nurturance and growth,
All dwell in peace.

*Ode to the Merciful and Numinous True Lord*
*Welcoming the Immortal Guest*

Hailing the sacred countenance, nurturing supreme excellence,
The lineage emerges from Southern Tang’s illustrious house.
Cultivating the mysterious model, virtue and merit perfected,
Wise and upright, ordained as divine by Heaven’s decree.

Again,
Majestic in holy presence, radiant in supreme power,
Floral emblems unite in fragrance, bestowed by Heaven.
The Dao’s practice exalted, loyalty and filial piety amassed,
Gloriously abiding in the Jade Palace, renowned in the immortal registers.

Again,
In harmony with the Two Modes, in concert with sun and moon,
Virtue moves Heaven to seal the golden and jade towers.
Revolving the pivot of transformation, displaying mighty deeds,
Bestowing fortune and longevity, inscribing life and dispelling calamity.

Again,
Manifesting holy works, enshrined in temple offerings,
Fortune’s land at Ao Peak accumulates numinous qi.
Opening grotto-heavens, establishing the eight directions,
Vowing to deliver and ferry all, beings awed by hidden grace.

Again,
Auspicious clouds suffuse, propitious qi drifts,
Heaven sends twin dragons descending in guard.
Raising the purple banner, dispersing mists and shadows,
Divine transformations resplendent, eternally revealing wondrous signs.

Again,
Dispelling drought, dissolving flood’s afflictions,
Healing illness, relieving suffering, spreading beneficence.
Locusts do not arise, fires self-extinguish,
People and creatures flourish, all through the divine power’s virtue.

Again,
Extending the imperial chart, perpetuating the state’s blessings,
Bestowing vast grace, ever in protection.
Honors conferred, titles inscribed,
Incense and fire perpetually flourishing, the divine presence abiding through the four seasons.

Again,
Gazing upon the mighty numen, beholding the sacred image,
Guardians sternly arrayed, clustered in jeweled regalia.
Sincerity moves, the divine mirror descends,
Safeguarding the realm, sheltering the people, eternally manifesting divine favor.
