### **Preface to the *You Long Zhuan***

Sima Zichang (Sima Qian) first composed historical records, establishing the forms of *Imperial Annals*, *Hereditary Houses*, and *Biographies*. Through these, the words and deeds of the ancient sages and worthies were preserved, vivid as if witnessed in their own time. Thus, from Ban Gu onward, all took them as models. Yet when it came to the births of the wise and sagely, though they were included in the records, the accounts were often brief, leaving scholars unable to trace their beginnings and ends.

In my humble and shallow understanding, I have combed through both inner and outer texts to expand upon them, hoping to achieve greater detail. However, as these matters lie beyond the mundane world, there are inevitably discussions where the ears and eyes do not meet. Nevertheless, I have recorded them in this transmission without敢 (daring to) omit anything, striving not to let words obscure meaning—this, perhaps, is the proper way.

Laozi’s surname was Li, his given name Er, and his courtesy name Boyang. His posthumous title was Cong. During the seventeenth year of King Yangjia of the Shang (the tenth of the eighteen Shang kings), in the *gengshen* year, his mother, while napping in the daytime, dreamed of the sun transforming into a flowing pearl that entered her mouth. She swallowed it and conceived, carrying him for eighty-one years—a fulfillment of the great yang’s nine-by-nine cycle. His mother then wandered beneath a li tree, and he was born from her left armpit. At birth, his hair was white, yet he could speak, pointing to the li tree and saying, “This is my surname.”

Another account states: His father was Li Lingfei, and his mother was Lady Yin, named Yishou. He was born in the ninth year of King Wuding of the Shang (the twenty-second king), in the *gengchen* year, on the fifteenth day of the second month at the *mao* hour, in Woxiang (or Laiqu Renli) of Ku County in the state of Chu, north of the Wo River.

By the time of King Zhou of the Shang, he resided south of Mount Qi. King Wen of Zhou appointed him as the Archivist of the Royal Treasury. After King Wu conquered the Shang, he was ordered to serve as the Archivist Beneath the Pillars. In the twenty-fifth year of King Zhao of Zhou, the *guichou* year (fifth month), he departed the Zhou riding a green ox and a faintly shimmering carriage, with Xu Jia as his driver.

Passing through Hangu Pass, the magistrate Yin Xi, skilled in astronomy, knew a sage was coming and thus purified himself to await his arrival. On the twelfth day of the seventh month, the Old Master arrived and bestowed the two scriptures of the *Dao* and *Virtue*. After roughly a thousand days, they met at the Green Ram Market in Shu Commandery and together crossed the Flowing Sands.

By the time of King You of Zhou, he returned to the Central States. Thus, Confucius traveled to Zhou to inquire about ritual. Later, at his former residence by the Wo River, he rode a white deer, ascended a cypress tree, and ascended to heaven.

Some say he was Lao Laizi; others, the Grand Scribe Tan. Some claim he lived over 160 years, owing to his cultivation of the Dao and nurturing of longevity. Others say he received teachings from Rong Cheng and sought the Dao from Chang Cong. The scholars’ reverence is earnest.

The *Shuowen* states: “The pine (*song*) has leaves that cluster around its body.” In ancient texts, *Wenzi* was written with the character for pine (*song*), but later vulgar readings changed it to “total” (*zong*), which is incorrect. The world knows not whether this is so or not, and thus calls him a “reclusive gentleman.”

His son was named Zong, who served as a general in Wei and was enfeoffed at Duangan for his merits. Zong’s son was Zhu; Zhu’s son was Gong; and Gong’s distant descendant was Jia. Jia served Emperor Wen of Han. Jia’s son was Jie, who became the Grand Tutor to the Prince of Jiaoxi and settled in Qi.

Where there are heaven and earth, there are the arts of the Dao. From the creation of written records to the present, the guardians of the Dao have existed in every generation. Moreover, Laozi was originally a spirit of humanity, for he attained the greatness of the Dao. Thus, he could communicate with spirits, perceive the unseen, and become the Master of the Dao—hence, the myriad spirits revered him, and the Three Realms submitted to him.

As for the nine elixirs and eight minerals, jade nectar and golden liquor, preserving the true and guarding the origin, contemplating spirits and traversing the hidden, refining the form through practice, dispelling misfortune and warding off evil, governing ghosts and nurturing nature, abstaining from grains and transforming the self, and commanding demons and spirits—these were all methods Laozi commonly employed to save the world, yet they do not represent the ultimate.

Only his emptiness and tranquility, his serenity and non-action, his purity and simplicity, his movements harmonizing with the Dao—these explain why, despite the many years he lived in Zhou, his rank and position never changed. He sought to blend his light with the dust and not set himself apart. Thus, he wrote: “My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice, yet none in the world can know them, none can practice them.” This is because the scholars of his age despised purity and simplicity, prizing the strange and transformative. Thus, the world and the Dao mutually lost each other.

Yet they did not know that the sage arises from the beginningless, is endowed by nature, manifests his true body to initiate the master-disciple relationship, and traverses kalpas to create heaven and earth. As for ascending to the throne of rulership, presiding over the numinous scriptures, compiling the charts of immortals, transmitting the treasured mysteries, serving as the teacher of emperors, and demonstrating his descent and birth—these are the sage’s vast and wondrous origins, shaping all things.

When he later withdrew from worldly glory and left Zhou, he commanded the green ox to harness his carriage, bid farewell to the Wei palace, and crossed Hangu Pass to the west. There, he tested Xu Jia with auspicious grass and bestowed the upper and lower chapters upon Yin Xi. He then ascended to the Purple Palace, fulfilling his prior agreement at the Green Ram. Crossing into the Flowing Sands, he transformed the barbarous customs. Returning to the Central States, he repeatedly encountered Confucius.

In the reign of Emperor Xiao Wen, he was known as the Master of the River’s Banks. In the reign of Emperor Xiao Cheng, he transmitted the *Scripture of Great Peace* to Gan Ji. During the Eastern Han, he bestowed the *Record of the Grain-Aiding Master* upon the Orthodox Succession. In the Jiahe era, Ge Xiaoxian dwelled on Mount Tiantai and obtained the secret canon of the Primordial Register. By the Later Wei, the Daoist Kou Qianzhi received further transmissions.

In the Tang, the true origins were traced, and he was revered as the Sacred Ancestor. When the Sagely Song came to rule the realm, Emperor Zhenzong commanded his carriage to pay homage.

That which is called "Without Beginning" is the child of the Supreme Ultimate and the grandchild of the Three Powers, the clan of the myriad things—this is the Dao. The sage takes the Dao as his body, and thus is nowhere absent. Tracing back to the origin of the Five Primes, it is the Without Beginning. When the threefold blackness intermingles and flows through the undifferentiated vastness, it becomes the ancestor of the primordial blackness.

That which is endowed by spontaneity arises first from the Without Beginning and later manifests as the true body. It is so of itself, yet its cause is unknown—hence it is called "spontaneous." The sage embodies the spontaneity of the Dao and thus possesses its endowment.

From the perspective of the floating Primordial, that which is born is nature. There are the wise and the foolish, the long-lived and the short-lived; when its essence is united, it is spontaneous, but when its function is separated, it is no longer spontaneous.

As for the manifestation of the true body: the wondrous origin is formless, the utmost reality is imageless. It gathers qi and congeals form, forcibly giving itself appearance. The *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure* states: "Above, there is no further ancestor; only the Dao is the body." The body of the Dao is the true body; descending from this, it becomes the dharma-body.

The so-called dharma-body is replete with subtlety and wonder, uniquely exalted in the Three Realms. Thus, the Nine Sages, Nine Perfected, and Nine Immortals ascend or descend in rank and attainment—all beginning here.

In initiating the master-disciple relationship, the sage moves with this arising resonance, engaging with beings and rousing humanity, thus establishing the teaching. Once the teaching is established, the method of master and disciple is practiced.

The scripture says: "In learning, one daily accumulates; in the Dao, one daily diminishes." Beginning with learning and daily accumulating, one gains something. Ending with the Dao and daily diminishing, one forgets something. Without attainment, one cannot be said to have learned; without forgetting, one cannot be said to have attained the Dao. Thus, the sage relinquishes the appearances of learning and avoids great delusion. The subtlety of the distinction lies in valuing and loving the mutual forgetting, the simultaneous dissolution of master and disciple.

As for traversing kalpas and destinies: the Three Realms and Nine Lands have their cycles of formation and dissolution. From the Seed People of the Four Heavens to the Great Luo of the Three Clarities, they are untouched by the disasters of the Nine Yangs and the Sixes, nor by the reckoning of the Stone-City of Mustard Seed. Thus, the Compassionate Venerables of the Three Realms and the Seed People of the Four Heavens endure beyond the end of kalpas and remain without end, even as all sages pass away.

In creating heaven and earth: the Most High descended the Three Blacks of the True Primordial Origin, forming the thirty-six heavens and thirty-six earths. Each heaven was established with a Heavenly Emperor, each earth with an Earthly Sovereign, to govern the hundred spirits and rule the myriad existences. The *Scripture of Salvation from Suffering* says: "Thirty-six above in heaven, thirty-six below on earth"—referring to this.

In ascending to the throne of rulership: heaven and earth are non-active, yet the accomplishments of the year are attributed to them; the sage is non-active, yet his position and achievements are fulfilled. The Three Realms and the ten directions are vast and great; without a governing principle or unifying origin, all would fall into chaos. The *Book of Changes* says: "The low and high are arrayed, and the noble and base have their positions." The world distinguishes high and low by noble and base, and clarifies ascent and descent by promotion and demotion. Yet the sage is not thus—like heaven, which is naturally high, or earth, which is naturally thick, covering all without exception and bearing all without fail.

In presiding over the numinous scriptures: the Most High Dao Lord entrusted the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, the *Scripture of Wisdom Dispelling Demons*, the *Treasure Chapters of the Divine Tiger*, and the *Golden Tablets and Jade Writings* to Lord Lao, to transmit to those of superior learning.

In compiling the charts of immortals: there are twenty-four ranks. The Compassionate Venerable of the Great Cavern’s Upper Clarity, through the transformation of the yang-blackness of the Cavern Yang, produced this chart. Those who cultivate in accordance with it can attain the manifestation of the twenty-four spirits of the Three Divisions and Eight Sceneries.

In transmitting the treasured mysteries: at the beginning of creation, the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to inscribe clouds into script, each character a zhang in size, with eight corners radiating light—this was the origin of celestial writing. The sage, wishing to expound the wondrous origin, thus composed them into scriptures, registers, talismans, and charts. Hence, there are the Three Caverns and Four Supplements, totaling thirty-six sections, serving as the forge and hammer of the great teaching.

In serving as the teacher of emperors: in the time of Fuxi, he was called Master Yuhua; in the time of Shennong, Master Dacheng; in the time of Zhurong, Master Guangshou; in the time of the Yellow Emperor, Master Guangcheng; in the time of Emperor Zhuan, Master Chijing; in the time of Emperor Ku, Master Lutuzhi; in the time of Emperor Yao, Master Wucheng; in the time of Emperor Shun, Master Junchen; in the time of Yu of Xia, Master Zhenxing; and in the time of the Shang kings, Master Xize—all transmitted scriptures and techniques to the emperors, enabling them to transform the world.

In demonstrating his descent and birth: in the seventeenth year of King Yang Jia of the Shang, the gengshen year, he was conceived in the womb of the Mysterious and Wondrous Jade Maiden for ninety-one years, and was born in Ku County of Bo in the gengchen year, the ninth year of King Wuding, on the fifteenth day of the second month.

In clarifying the sagely lineage: the ancestors of the numinous flight began after Emperor Zhuan, and by the time of Lingfei, there had been several dozen generations. Lingfei married Yin of Tianshui, who was the Mysterious and Wondrous Jade Maiden.

In serving as the Pillar Historian: the sage concealed his sageliness and equaled the common, accepting a humble position to demonstrate the way of minister and subject.

In leaving Zhou: the sage entrusted himself to the dust to harmonize with the world, engaging with the age to extend the Dao. Thus, his advancement was not timely, nor was his retreat a mere concealment—how could it be bound by the gains and losses of success or failure?

As for the trial of Xu Jia, Confucius said: "Where there is praise, there must be trial." Though the sage perceived the Dao with a single glance, he still subjected it to trial—how much more so for Xu Jia? Thus, the immortal path comprises twenty-five trials, with wealth and sensuality foremost. Xu Jia was tested by sensuality, yet there were things he could not surpass.

The trial of the Pass Keeper occurred because his Dao was profound and weighty, hence this encounter; thus, he passed all trials. Next came the transmission of scriptures, for once trials were passed, his conduct was true and his resolve firm. The sage’s measure held a master within, so he bestowed upon him the Upper and Lower Scriptures, that the great Dao might be transmitted.

The Green Sheep Market was where the Most High made an appointment with Lord Yin to lodge for the night. After a thousand-day term and a single moment’s meeting, he listened, leapt, and bowed his head, then commanded his cloud chariot to follow. Thereafter, he transformed eighty-one Hu kings.

The ninety-six kinds of heterodox ways were the strange customs beyond the Flowing Sands, where the sound of teaching had never been heard. With fox faces and wolf hearts, they knew only slaughter. Some were male, some female, some human, some not—shaving heads and beards, clad in black, barefoot, performing all manner of demonic deeds to disrupt the land. The Most High then commanded Lord Yin to subdue them with the true Dharma.

As for Confucius inquiring about ritual, Confucius questioned Laozi’s words and arose with the sigh of the "reclusive dragon." Yet when sage questions sage, how could they not be mystically one? This was but the sage’s reverence for the greatness of the Dao, the beginning of teaching.

The title "Riverbank Elder" refers to one who manifested traces by the river during the reign of Emperor Wen of Han, received subtle teachings, and later ascended to the cloudy Han. The transmission of the *Scripture of Great Peace* occurred when, during the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han, a man of Beihai named Gan Ji encountered the Most High at Langye and received it. By the time of Emperor Shun of Later Han, a man of Langye named Gong Chong presented it at court. His memorial stated: "My kin received it from Gan Ji, who said he received it directly from the Most High—altogether one hundred and seventy scrolls."

The ordination of the Celestial Master of Han: the Celestial Master was a descendant of the Marquis of Liu, originally a great Confucian scholar. Suppressing his ambition for official rank, he cultivated the methods of transcending the world. On Mount Wei, he encountered a divine person who bestowed upon him the elixir formula. He then went to western Shu to refine it. The Most High descended in his chariot and expounded the *Scriptures of the Northern and Southern Dippers*, conferring the twenty-four ranks of registers. Thereafter, he commanded the Five Pestilences, the Eight Divisions, and the Six Heavenly Gu Qi, transforming the earth into a salt spring and establishing the methods of fasts and Offerings. After a long time, he ascended to immortality in broad daylight at Cloud Terrace.

Lord Ge the Immortal cultivated practice on Mount Tiantai, where the Most High descended again to bestow upon him the methods of the Six Fasts. The Daoist Kou Qianzhi secluded himself on Mount Song, where the Most High also descended to transmit scriptures, registers, and the title "True Lord of Great Peace." He reported this fully to Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei, who then changed the era name from Taiyan to "True Lord of Great Peace" for this reason.

The Sacred Ancestor of Great Tang manifested at the beginning of Emperor Gaozu’s reign, calling himself the Imperial Ancestor. By the reign of Emperor Xizong, every descent was recorded in the national history.

In our present dynasty, Emperor Zhenzong, with full ceremonial regalia, journeyed to Jing-Bo to pay homage, thereby honoring the intent of reverence and loyalty.

*Record of the Reclusive Dragon, Scroll One*
Compiled by Master Jia Shansiang, Left Attendant Censor and Joint Director of the Teaching of the Abandoned Writings, Great Master of Lofty Virtue and Awakened Perfection

At the inception before the primordial chaos had divided, before the numinous spirits had taken root, there stood the subtle and wondrous origin—this was the Dao. This so-called Dao defies the tracing of its roots, eludes the measuring of its bounds, yet the Great Sage is endowed with it and born within its midst. Thus, that which is called "without beginning" is none other than the Most High. The Most High arises from the beginningless, emerges from the causeless, stands as the forerunner of all ways, and the progenitor of primordial darkness. Vast and formless, without light or image, without color or sound, without lineage or thread, it dwells in profound obscurity. Within it lies essence, and this essence is most true, pervading all without limit—hence it is called the Great Dao.

The Dao is the wondrous origin of spontaneity. Within its subtlety arises the Void and Cavernous—this is the True One. The True One is neither existent nor non-existent. From this singular darkness emerge the Upper Three Darknesses; their triune virtue gives birth to the Utmost High. From the Utmost High arise the Middle Three Darknesses; their triune virtue gives birth to the True Old. From the True Old arise the Lower Three Darknesses; their triune virtue gives birth to the Most High. From the Most High then emerge the Anterior Three Darknesses; their triune virtue gives birth to Lord Lao. From Lord Lao manifest the Posterior Three Darknesses, which further transform to generate the True Wondrous Jade Maiden. The Jade Maiden, imbued with the Three Darknesses, coalesces in primordial chaos, congealing into a five-colored radiance of mysterious yellow, vast as a pellet. It flows into the mouth of the Mysterious Wondrous One, who swallows it and conceives. After eighty-one years, he emerges from the left armpit. Born with white hair, he is thus named Laozi. Laozi is none other than Lord Lao, the very embodiment of the Great Dao, the progenitor of primordial darkness, and the root of heaven and earth.

The Great Dao is subtle and wondrous, arising spontaneously, born from the unborn, preceding all precedence, emerging from the Void and Cavernous. It nurtures and shapes the cosmos, and is thus named the Utmost High. Its transformations are boundless, beyond naming, hence it is said: "I arise before form, emerge before the Great Beginning, extend from the inception of the Great Commencement, and traverse the origin of the Great Simplicity. I drift through the hidden and empty, entering and exiting the profound and obscure. I observe the undivided chaos, the undifferentiated clear and turbid, the unilluminated Three Luminaries, and the unformed myriad things. Alone, I dwell in the realm of the indistinct and vague, roam the boundless wilds, standing solitary and unmatched. Invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, intangible to grasp. Thus begins the Primordial Chaos."

Endowed with spontaneity, Lord Lao is the true essence of primordial qi, the natural workings of creation. Spontaneity is the Dao. When given form, it becomes Lord Lao. With emptiness and non-being as the Dao, and spontaneity as its nature, nothing can compel it to be so, nor prevent it from being so. It knows not why it is so, nor why it is not so—hence it is said to be spontaneously so.

Should one ride the earth as a chariot and wield the heavens as a canopy, racing and roaming across the eight directions, it would not compare to its vastness. Should one delve into the hidden and minute, reaching the finest without boundary, or dissect the hair and split the grain, attaining the smallest without interior, it would not suffice to describe its minuteness. Should the eight tones harmonize, the five notes blend, or the fierce winds, swift thunder, ocean tides, and thunderous drums resound, it would not suffice to convey its sound. Should the mysterious and yellow radiate brilliantly, the cinnabar and azure glow resplendently, or the dazzling and magnificent shine with splendor and elegance, it would not suffice to express its color. Should light blaze and illuminate, spirits flicker and vanish, or the wind rush and lightning strike like arrows, it would not suffice to capture its speed. Should roots anchor in the ninefold earth, or peaks tower over the eight seas, waters congeal in marshes, or springs halt at mountains, it would not suffice to describe its stillness. Should yin and yang remain unfathomable, transformations appear boundless, or creation advance and retreat, animating the myriad things, it would not suffice to convey its divinity. Should light pierce the dim and obscure, or insight penetrate the formless, gazing upward to the origin of utmost yang or scrutinizing the root of utmost yin, it would not suffice to describe its clarity. Should shadows disperse and echoes fade, clouds gather and mists scatter, returning to the root and reverting to the origin, utterly still and unmoving, it would not suffice to express its nothingness. Should it cleanse the cosmos of dust and grime, sweep away the obscurity of the Milky Way, extend downward without foundation, or reach upward to the boundless expanse, enveloping the six directions and governing the three realms, it would not suffice to convey its emptiness.

For the Dao is fundamentally formless, and the true has no appearance. It borrows emptiness to feign existence, with essence and function mutually manifest, yet this does not exhaust its wonder—thus it is ascribed to spontaneity. Spontaneity is the ultimate principle. United, it is spontaneity; divided, it is the Dao and virtue. Hence, it is revered by all sages, and neither present nor past can erase it. As the scripture says: "The Dao is honored, virtue is noble—none confer rank upon them, yet they are eternally spontaneous." This is its meaning.

Beholding the True Form
Lord Lao is the utmost essence of the unborn and the supreme spirit of manifest form. Once, within the vast emptiness, primordial darkness congealed and essence coalesced, assuming form. His body is boundless, his countenance perfect, with nothing above to grasp and nothing below to tread. At times, he appears above the clouds, his body golden, his face radiating five lights. Naturally, he manifests divine kings, warriors, azure dragons, white tigers, qilin, and lions, arrayed before and behind him. At other times, he takes the form of a thousand-petaled lotus, radiant as the sun, his head crowned with a sevenfold diadem of clouds and auroras, his body draped in a nine-colored robe of layered silk. A halo encircles his neck, and in his hand, he holds the Five Luminaries. Or he rides the Eight Radiant Jade Chariot, drawn by five-colored divine dragons, bearing the streaming crimson banners of the celestial realm and the nine-light crane canopy. Or he mounts a jade-axled carriage with wheels of vajra, harnessing nine dragons, flanked by ten thousand immortals. Flying cloud canopies and floating jewels illuminate above and below, while incense burns and flowers scatter, drifting through the void. Heavenly melodies and wondrous music lead and follow. At times, he sits upon a golden hall within a seven-jeweled canopy, adorned with pearl banners and gem-studded nets draped above. Immortals stand in attendance, divine attendants guard the chariots, and myriad forms of regalia fill the vast emptiness.

Or his golden countenance shines with jade-like purity, clad in yellow robes embroidered with sacred patterns, resting his arm upon a table as he wields a whisk, convening an assembly of immortals. Or he wears a dark crown and plain white robes, riding a white horse with crimson trappings, flanked by immortal youths, his divine radiance illuminating all with clarity. His majestic and transcendent form defies description.

Yet the most virtuous, by stilling their minds and focusing their thoughts, may direct their contemplation toward his august presence—and thus, in response to their devotion, he manifests. In manifesting, he bestows blessings, enabling him to traverse the Three Realms and deliver boundless salvation.

The Great Dao abides in formlessness; being formless, it cannot be perceived by ordinary eyes. Yet when devotion stirs and resonance arises, such resonance is not confined to a single mode. At times, he reveals his immortal and wondrous form, or even a mortal body. He may soar or stride, appear exalted or humble; he may dwell in mountains or the world of men, among the Yi or the Xia—his manifestations are unfathomable, responding to the purity of the devotee’s intent, vanishing when the resonance ceases. He comes from nowhere, departs to nowhere, pervading both existence and non-existence, encompassing all things.

Those who awaken attain this understanding; the deluded remain mired in eternal suffering. To know the true form of the Dao, one need look no further than this.

The Dao cannot be seen—what is seen is not the Dao. The Dao cannot be heard—what is heard is not the Dao. For its principle and teaching run deep, perfectly still and unmoving. Yet within this stillness, it enables the unseen to see and the unheard to hear. Here, wisdom and perception arise in mutual response, and resonance brings forth communion. Though the paths of resonance and stillness differ, their essence is one. Thus it is said: *The Dao constantly takes no action, yet there is nothing it does not do.* "Taking no action" is its essence; "nothing it does not do" is its function.

The *Sutra of the Original Boundary* states: "When the mind contemplates the Dao, there are two kinds of perception. The first is the perception of the Dharma-body, adorned with seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences, supremely subtle and revered above the Three Realms. The second is the perception of the true body, like empty space—perfect, pure, unborn, and undying."

If one cannot yet clearly discern these forms, one may rely on images and records to focus the mind. Cast in purple gold, depict his true form; or fashion it from clay, wood, bronze, or pigments, according to one’s means. Erect halls and canopies, adorn with banners, flowers, lamps, and candles—offerings made with sincerity. By honoring the image as one would the true body, and contemplating it with devotion, the merit is equal.

If one can perceive the formless within the form, then the image and the true form are not two in principle. Thus, reverence for the image follows the heart, and blessings are received accordingly. The weight of merit lies solely in the mind; with each thought advancing, enlightenment naturally follows. As it is said: *When a person contemplates the Dao, the Dao also contemplates that person.*

Following this Dharma-body, his Dharma-names respond to the depth of devotion. Lord Lao emerged from the emptiness of the primordial void, his transformations spontaneous, his wisdom boundless, his sacred virtue complete. His form is unfathomable, and his names are without limit. In heaven, he is the Lord of the Myriad Heavens; among sages, the Sovereign of the Myriad Sages; among immortals, the Chief of the Myriad Immortals; among perfected beings, the Foremost of the Myriad Perfected; among stars, the Heavenly August Emperor; and in the teachings, the Most High Lord Lao.

At times, he bears a thousand and two hundred titles; at others, a hundred and eighty names. He is called the Father of Non-Action, the Mother of the Myriad Things, co-eternal with the Great Dao, the root and origin of heaven and earth. Vast and boundless, he defies all description.

To summarize, he possesses ten principal titles, bestowed upon his descent into the world when the sages of the ten directions in the void praised him thus: First, the Nameless Lord; second, the Supreme Primordial Elder; third, the Most High Lord Lao; fourth, the Exalted Master Lao; fifth, the Heavenly August Emperor; sixth, the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; seventh, the Ancient Master; eighth, the Golden Portal Emperor; ninth, the Most High August Sovereign; and tenth, the Great Perfected of Emptiness and Non-Being.

Extending this reasoning, the Dharma-body returns to the true body, and the true body unites with the wondrous origin—all are expressions of the interplay of resonance and response.

**On the Transmission Between Master and Disciple**

The mystery of the Dao cannot be sought through form, color, sound, or taste; it must be transmitted through the guidance of a master. The sages of antiquity possessed innate wisdom, awakening to the one and thereby comprehending the myriad—ultimately attaining a state beyond cultivation and beyond realization. To be beyond cultivation is the perfection of cultivation; to be beyond realization is the perfection of realization.

Even such sages relied upon masters to illuminate their understanding—how much more so for those who are not sages? Thus, the sages established teachings for the world, instituting methods of transmission. For those of middling or lesser capacity, these teachings serve as a guiding rule; without them, there is no way to deepen one’s understanding.

As recorded in the Three Caverns and Four Supplements, the *Upper Clarity Scriptures* are transmitted under the oath of the Golden Dragon and Jade Fish, sworn before heaven. Thus, the one who transmits is called the master, and the one who receives is called the disciple. This binds their resolve, guards against carelessness, and avoids the fault of recklessly divulging secrets, which would incur karmic retribution.

From this, it is clear that the Dao cannot be pursued without a master, nor can the teachings be upheld without a patriarch. Thus, Lord Lao’s master was the Most High Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord, who was himself a disciple of the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning. The Celestial Worthy was born countless eons ago, the progenitor of the Dao. Therefore, the Great Dao Lord became the disciple of the Celestial Worthy and the master of Lord Lao. With these two sages established, Lord Lao succeeded them.

Why is he called "Lao"? "Lao" is a title of seniority, and "Jun" is a designation of lordship. Lord Lao, having traversed heaven above and earth below through endless transformations, was born before countless eons and will endure beyond them. He is revered as the patriarch by all heavens and the teacher of all emperors—hence the title *Most High Lord Lao*.

The three sages, passing the transmission through the ages, set an eternal example. To honor this lineage of transmission, their revered status is recorded. This is the foundation of the master-disciple tradition.

As *Zhuangzi* says: *"O my master! O my master! You harmonize the myriad things yet claim no righteousness; you bestow blessings upon ten thousand generations yet claim no benevolence; you are older than high antiquity yet claim no age; you encompass heaven and earth, shaping all forms yet claim no skill; you existed before the Great Ultimate yet claim no loftiness; you dwell below the Six Poles yet claim no depth; you preceded heaven and earth yet claim no duration."* Such is he.

Moreover, the Dao Lord and Lord Lao possess the virtue of the utmost sagely, their every movement and stillness in accord with the Dao—how could they rely on mere transmission from a master? Yet the principle of sagely transmission from sage to sage is inherently mysterious and identical. Nevertheless, the inception of teaching necessarily depends on the passing of instruction, serving as the guidepost for past and present and the grand model for humans and heavens.

Through the kalpas and cosmic cycles, the *Lingbao Sutra* states: *"To preserve and regulate the kalpas and cycles, ensuring heaven’s enduring existence."* Now, kalpas may be minor or major, cycles brief or prolonged. Sweeping a mustard-seed city with a stone broom marks a minor kalpa; the "Yang Nine and Yin Six" signify a major one. The Five Phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—govern the cycles, while their waxing and waning mark the transitions. If a kalpa ends before the cycle shifts, or the cycle shifts before the kalpa concludes, this does not constitute a true kalpa-cycle. Only when the two converge does the waxing and waning become manifest.

Generally, the sage is born together with heaven and earth, becoming one with the myriad things. Thus, they can create heaven and earth, establish the divine and numinous, preserve and renew them, transcending all celestial barriers. Those who endure through kalpas and cycles without end—Lord Lao is such a one. Born in the beginningless, arising from the causeless, standing alone before the Qi Ford, traversing the world after the Opening of the Pass, he has passed through kalpas and cycles for immeasurable eons.

A kalpa is the name for the formation and dissolution of heaven and earth, the exhaustion of yin and yang’s reckoning. When yang is exhausted, yin arises, hence the great flood; when yin is exhausted, yang prevails, hence the great fire. Yang culminates at nine, thus the "Yang Nine"; yin culminates at six, thus the "Yin Six." Minor kalpas span 3,300 years, middling ones 9,900 years, and major ones 810,000 years, marking the end of a kalpa. Lord Lao descends to be born and enact transformation through these kalpas and cycles, their number beyond reckoning.

The *Red Writ* states: *"A kalpa-cycle consists of thirty days as one transition, twelve transitions as one degree, 3,300 degrees as a minor kalpa, and 9,900 degrees as a major kalpa."* The "Yang Nine and Yin Six" reach their extreme to form a kalpa-cycle, for yang culminates at nine and yin at six. Whenever yin and yang’s reckoning culminates at nine and six, the Three Realms are swept away. Thus, the surging waters and raging fires are the inevitable consequence of yin and yang’s exhaustion.

Furthermore, once the Great Dao divides, it separates into the Five Phases, flowing through the Five Kalpas. At the beginning and end of each kalpa, the Most High descends to establish teachings, delivering humans and heavens. The Five Kalpas are: Longhan as the Wood Kalpa, Chiming as the Fire Kalpa, Yankang as the Earth Kalpa, Kaihuang as the Metal Kalpa, and Shanghuang as the Water Kalpa. With the unfolding of the Five Kalpas, the Five Phases govern in turn, rising and falling in an endless cycle.

The *Scripture of Western Ascension* states: *"Since the beginning of the upper age, the changes have been like grains of sand. Every movement entails kalpas of burden—how arduous it has been!"*

At the division of Heaven and Earth from the Primordial Chaos, the Three Powers emerged—what was light and pure ascended to form Heaven, while what was heavy and turbid descended to form Earth. With Heaven above and Earth below, the essences of yin and yang were complete, and from their harmonious union, humanity was fashioned. As the Scripture states: *"The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two give birth to the Three."* This is what it describes.

Some may ask: *"Can a single sage create Heaven and Earth?"* The answer is: Heaven and Earth are the greatest of all that is formed, yet all that is formed arises from the formless. Only the formless can give rise to Heaven and Earth—for the formless is the Dao, and even the sage does not depart from it. Thus, the sage carves clouds into scripts, disseminates them across the heavens, weighs the worthy and inscribes the true, holding sway over the hidden and the manifest. Passing the Dao from sage to sage, how is this different from the primordial beginning? Reasoning thus, there can be no doubt.

For Laozi is the ancestor of the undifferentiated chaos, the father and mother of Heaven and Earth. He stands upon the path of effortless action, roams the realm of perfect freedom, ascends and descends through the empty void, rides the currents of yin and yang to shape and refine. He divides the clear from the turbid, opens and closes the cosmos, suspends the Three Luminaries, and nurtures the ten thousand beings. Through him, Heaven and Earth are sundered and ordered; the sun and moon move in their courses; the four seasons succeed one another; and the Five Phases generate in turn.

At the dawn of the first of ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety-nine million, nine hundred ninety-nine *heis*, he set the Three Primordial *Heis* of True Origin in motion to form Heaven. Above, they became the Three Clarities and Three Realms: the *Hei* of the Beginning as the Jade Clarity Realm, the *Hei* of the True as the Supreme Clarity Realm, and the *Hei* of the Origin as the Grand Clarity Realm. From each of the Three Clarities, three further *heis* were born, combining into nine *heis* to form the Nine Heavens:

1. The Boundless Joy of Yudan Heaven,
2. The Infinite Life of Supreme Meditation Heaven,
3. The Brahma-Perfected Suxian Heaven,
4. The Serene Doushu Heaven,
5. The Unshakable Joy of Pāramitā Heaven,
6. The Resonant Transformation of Empty Mystery Heaven,
7. The Numinous Transformation of Brahma-Assisting Heaven,
8. The Lofty Void of Pure Brightness Heaven,
9. The Heaven of No-Thought, No-Knot, No-Attachment.

Each of these Nine Heavens generates three *heis*, each *hei* constituting one heaven, totaling twenty-seven heavens. Including these Nine Heavens, there are twenty-six heavens, which, together with the Three Realms and the Four Peoples, culminate in the Three Clarities—such is their number.

The first six heavens below belong to the Realm of Desire:
1. Grand Yellow Heaven,
2. Grand Brightness Heaven,
3. Pure Brightness Heaven,
4. Origin Womb Heaven,
5. Origin Brightness Heaven,
6. Seven Luminaries Heaven.

The next eighteen heavens belong to the Realm of Form:
1. Void Emptiness Heaven,
2. Supreme Ultimate Heaven,
3. Crimson Brightness Heaven,
4. Reverent Splendor Heaven,
5. Luminous Radiance Heaven,
6. August Calyx Heaven,
7. Void Brightness Heaven,
8. Upright Tranquility Heaven,
9. Origin Brightness Heaven,
10. Extreme Shaking Heaven,
11. Origin Bearing Heaven,
12. Supreme Peace Heaven,
13. Extreme Wind Heaven,
14. Beginning August Heaven,
15. Grand Yellow Heaven,
16. No-Thought Heaven,
17. Upper Joy of Die-Ruan Heaven,
18. Boundless Vow of Tan Heaven.

The next four heavens belong to the Formless Realm:
1. Cloud-Crossing Heaven,
2. Origin Cavern Heaven,
3. Wondrous Completion Heaven,
4. Forbidden Upper Heaven.

These twenty-eight heavens are called the Three Realms, subject to the turning of kalpas and the refining of yin and yang. The *heis* have their limits, and humans have their lifespans. In the first heaven, Grand August Huangzeng Heaven, humans live for nine million years. Each subsequent heaven doubles the lifespan, so that across the twenty-eight heavens, the years of life culminate in one hundred twenty-seven million, nine hundred seventy-seven thousand, five hundred fifty-two million years. Below, down to the conjunction of the sun and moon, there are forty-four billion, four hundred forty-four million, four hundred forty-four thousand, four hundred forty-four *heis*, with each *hei* spanning three thousand *li*.

Above these lies another four heavens, called the Heavens of Seed-People:
1. Constant Fusion Heaven,
2. Jade Prosperity Heaven,
3. Brahma-Crossing Heaven,
4. Jia-Yi Heaven.

These four heavens transcend the Three Realms, beyond the reach of the sun and moon’s light. Their inhabitants illuminate one another with the radiance of their bodies, thus they are neither born nor perish, without measure of years or term of decay. Even at the turning of the great kalpas, calamity does not reach them. The heavens and earths below, however, perish with the kalpas; when the kalpic cycle renews and chaos is once more sundered, the people of these heavens descend by the command of the Most High to instruct and establish teachings, just as in the beginning of the kalpa of Kun, when the Three Sovereigns succeeded one another in governance.

Above these are the Three Clarity Realms:
1. Grand Crimson Heaven,
2. Yu-Yu Heaven,
3. Pure Subtlety Heaven.

Highest of all is the Great Enveloping Heaven, which encompasses all heavens, supreme and without peer. At its summit lies the Mysterious Capital and Jade Metropolis, where the Three Honored Ones reside, and the myriad sages pay homage—this is the realm of the ultimate Dao, the root of all transformations.

Having divided the heavens, the pure yang *hei* above formed the Thirty-Six Heavens, while the pure yin *hei* below formed the Thirty-Six Earths. Each heaven is governed by a Heavenly Emperor, and each earth by an Earthly Sovereign, with the seventy-two rulers all receiving their mandate from Lord Lao.

The so-called Thirty-Six Earths begin with the Nine Strata:
1. Moist-Colored Earth,
2. Hard-Colored Earth,
3. Fat-Gloss Earth,
4. Moist-Gloss Earth,
5. Golden-Grain-Gloss Earth,
6. Metal-Steel-Iron-Gloss Earth,
7. Water-Restrained Earth,
8. Great Wind-Gloss Earth,
9. Cavern-Abyss Formless-Net Earth.

Within these Nine Strata, each stratum is layered first with a stratum of soil, then one of water, then one of wind, totaling twenty-seven layers. The Nine Earths are these Nine Strata. Each earth consists of one layer of soil, one of water, and one of wind, mutually supporting one another.

Beneath the lowest of the Nine Strata lies the Cavern-Abyss Net-Earth. Below it stretches an expanse vast and boundless, where turbid emptiness congeals and stagnates, its depths unfathomable.

The *Scripture of Cavern Perfection* states: Each of the Nine Earths is divided into four quarters, governed by Earthly Sovereigns who oversee the eastern, western, southern, and northern domains, with their officials and subordinates numbering in the tens of thousands. Moreover, each cavern is ruled by a Perfected King, totaling thirty-six Perfected Kings, who govern the immortals of the lower realms in like manner. Thus, the Nine Earths together comprise thirty-six Earthly Sovereigns and thirty-six Perfected Kings, corresponding above to the Thirty-Six Heavens, at their center to the Thirty-Six Caverns, and below to the Thirty-Six Earths.

What the Confucians call the "Nine Heavens and Nine Earths" refers merely to the grand enumeration of heaven and earth. Heaven takes form through the coagulation of pure, floating *qi*, while earth solidifies from the accumulation of turbid, sluggish matter. Between heaven and earth lie the numinous palaces of the cavern realms, situated within renowned mountains and connected to the depths below. These serve as conduits for the *qi* of the Nine Earths, forming the boundless void where the essences of the sun and moon illuminate their interiors, and where immortals and sages hold their respective positions.

As *Liezi* states: "Earth is but accumulated clods—there is no place without clods." This, too, speaks only of its general nature. Below the lowest earth, all is dark and obscure, devoid of light, for the accumulated yin *qi* renders it so.

Master Zongyuan observes: "Above the Nine Heavens, there is no yin; below the Nine Earths, there is no yang." The intermingling of yin and yang to generate and transform the myriad things occurs precisely between heaven and earth. His words are trustworthy.

The *Scripture of the Cavern Perfection’s Foreign Lands and Dharma Realms* records: The first stratum lies 907,200 *li* from heaven, while the summit of the Nine Strata is 12,180,000 *li* from heaven. The *Book of Celestial Patterns* states: The breadth of the Eight Extremities totals 1,814,400 *li*, and the distance between heaven and earth is half that of the Eight Extremities. This aligns with the scriptural account.

Beneath the Nine Earths lies the root of the Great Void, unrecorded in scriptures and diagrams, difficult to measure in detail. As *Liezi* says: "Beyond heaven and earth, there is no limit, no end." Thus, there is no "no-limit," no "no-end."

The realms of the various heavens number five hundred million in their distinctions, all born of the *qi* of the Thirty-Six Heavens. Hence, the pure and floating is called heaven; the turbid and sedimentary, earth; the yang radiance, the sun; the yin essence, the moon; the radiant emanations, stars; the fallen remnants, stones; the angular, halos; the circular, coronas; facing the sun, parhelia; turning from the sun, rainbows; ascending, clouds; descending, mist; rumbling, thunder; clashing, lightning; light, snow; heavy, hail; prolonged, rain; dispersed, wind; blazing, fire; congealed, ice; hardened, metal; brittle, wood; fluid, water; compacted, soil; flowing, rivers; swirling, springs; level, plains; piled, mountains. In heaven, these are patterns; on earth, veins. The moon’s waxing is the new moon; its waning, the dark moon. Dawn is day; dusk, night. Numinous *qi* is spirit; refined *qi*, humans; tranquil *qi*, ghosts; agitated *qi*, insects; mixed *qi*, birds and beasts; perverse *qi*, demons and malevolent spirits. Distinction yields yin and yang; blending yields the four seasons. Through the transformations of the four seasons, the myriad things are born.

Its height is boundless, its depth unfathomable. It envelops heaven and earth, embracing the formless. Unfurled, it covers the Six Directions; gathered, it does not fill a fist. Small yet capable of greatness, dim yet capable of brightness, weak yet capable of strength, soft yet capable of hardness, it harbors yin and exhales yang, accomplishing all things without exception.

Within the earth lie the Thirty-Six Cavern-Heavens, corresponding to the heavens above, where the essences of the sun and moon illuminate their interiors. Thus, celestial patterns and terrestrial veins, the Six Jia and Five Phases, the transformations of yin and yang—all are opened by Lord Lao as the gate of manifold wonders, set in motion by the power of the hundred spirits, giving life, bringing to completion, enacting, and transforming.

Therefore, it is said: The Dao is the origin of the myriad transformations, the root of the Profound Mystery. Heaven attains it and becomes clear; earth attains it and becomes tranquil; things attain it and come to life; spirits attain it and become numinous; seas and mountains attain it and become steadfast; kings and lords attain it and achieve great peace; Daoists attain it and become immortals; withered and decayed things attain it and flourish anew.

Lord Lao is the master of yin and yang, the Emperor of the Myriad Spirits, the father and mother of primordial *qi*, the teacher and artisan of former kings, the key and lock of the ten thousand things. He fashions and cools the formless void, creates and transforms the myriad existences, girds the Eight Extremities, bears the earth and suspends the heavens, roams and races with the sun and moon, revolves and turns the stars, breathes with the Six Jia, commands and governs the cosmos, shifts the cold and heat, drives and employs the winds and clouds, stirs the thunder and lightning, controls the advance and retreat of floods and droughts, determines the waxing and waning of calendric cycles—all issuing from this.

The *Scripture of Ascent to the Throne* states: The Dao has no before or after; those who awaken to it are as one. Ranks have ascent and descent; those who realize them differ. Thus, the Three Realms are vast and boundless, the hundred spirits tangled and disordered. Without the Dao, there is separation; without its master, there is chaos. Therefore, in governance there must be a lineage, in convergence there must be an origin—only then is there no limit.

Viewed from the human world, nobility and baseness have their ranks, high and low their degrees. Even the laws of former kings for governing the world follow this principle. Since the time when the Luminous Three Clarities were established, heaven and earth have neither increased nor diminished, the hidden and manifest have risen and fallen. If not for a true sage to govern them by position and merit, who could partake in this?

Yet how could Lord Lao, with the merit of a great sage, who gives life to heaven and earth and nurtures the myriad things, be confined to ranks, titles, or names?

Yet above stands the august supremacy of the Primordial Beginning, next the sagely Dao Sovereign, and below them Lord Lao, who follows in the Dao Sovereign’s position. Through transformation and merit, he has set the Three Qi in motion across the Ten Thousand Heavens, spreading the manifold laws. His primordial merit fully manifest, he has attained the fruit of the ultimate Dao and the rank of the Three Honored Ones, inheriting the charge of the Most High and assuming the august dignity of the Dharma King.

Thus, above he governs the early sages, in the middle he orders the host of perfected beings, and below he commands the various immortals, thereby unifying the thirty-six heavens, thirty-six earths, seventy-two lords, the stars and the sun and moon, the mountains and marshes, the ten thousand spirits, the transformations of yin and yang, and all divine luminaries. From the heavens above to the heavens below, from the earth above to the earth below, across the five hundred million celestial realms, whether sentient or insentient, conscious or unconscious, formed or formless—all are subject to Lord Lao’s governance.

He ever dwells within the Great Clarity’s precincts, in the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate, amidst cinnabar terraces, purple towers, and jade halls. There stand the Three Great Immortals, the Nine Supreme Emperors, the Twenty-Seven Heavenly Lords, the Eighty-One Ministers and Grand Masters, the One Thousand Two Hundred Immortal Officials, the Twenty-Four Thousand Spirit Offices, the Seventy Thousand Immortal Youths and Jade Maidens, and the Five Hundred Million Celestial Soldiers and Divine Kings, all arrayed in attendance along the cloud thoroughfares. As for his retinue—rainbow-bodied lions, golden-winged garuḍas, phoenixes and numinous beasts, heavenly steeds and qilins—all stand guard to his left and right.

At times, Lord Lao ascends to pay court to the Primordial Beginning, memorializing the accounts of sin and blessing; in the middle, he attends the Jade Dawn. He examines the registers of the Nine Palaces and oversees the ledgers of life and death throughout the Three Realms, along with the offices that scrutinize all divine officials and ghostly functionaries. This extends to the Ten Great Caverns, the Thirty-Six Lesser Caverns, the Seventy-Two Blessed Lands, the Thirty-Six Tranquil Retreats, the Twenty-Four Transformations, the immortal palaces and numinous grottoes, and the bureaus of blessed sustenance—nothing, however hidden, escapes his jurisdiction.

At other times, descending to govern the Nine Heavens, he resides among the Six Stars of the Supreme Subtlety and the Curved Array, where he is styled the Heavenly August Great Emperor Radiant-Soul Treasure. Thus, he rides the Three Envoys and the Six, wields the Nine Pivots, and oversees the one myriad, one thousand, five hundred and twenty named entities. Holding the immortal records, he presides over divine persons, perfected persons, immortals, sages, and worthies. Before him, a hundred million Heavenly Kings bow in reverence, entreating him for wind and rain, flood and drought, abundance and scarcity, adversity and prosperity, life and death, good and evil. Traversing the ten thousand directions, he propagates the great Dao’s transformative influence—yet Lord Lao ever abides in the Palace of the Great Clarity and the Supreme Ultimate.

**Canon of the Numinous**
The jade tablets and golden scripts, the characters inscribed upon cloud-traced jade, all emerged after the initial unfolding of the Dao’s teachings, serving as the key to the manifold mysteries. As the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure* states: “Without script, there is no illumination; without script, there is no clarity; without script, there is no establishment; without script, there is no completion.” This is precisely its meaning.

In former times, Lord Lao, from the Most High Dao Sovereign and the Supreme Tenuity of the Grand Subtlety, received all that he obtained, thereby securing his own deliverance. Thus, he came to grasp heaven and earth, command the gods, deliver the dead, and transcend the living, attaining perfection and realizing the Dao. Therefore, the Most High holds the Tiger Talisman of the Divine, the *White Scripture of Wisdom*, and upon the Terrace of Harmonious Dawn at the Numinous Crag, he presented the Nine Mysteries to the Purple Empyrean below and unified the early perfected beings in the Azure Writs above.

Thereupon, the Most Wondrous Perfected Person and the Jade Maiden of the Jade Clarity, bearing the fragrant blossoms of the Vermilion Mound and holding the subtle, profound chapters, approached. The Dao Sovereign rinsed his mouth with azure water, exhaled crimson qi, emptied his mind, stilled his body, calmed his spirit, and focused upon the wondrous. Girded with the Divine Tiger on his left and the Golden Perfected on his right, he expounded the *Upper Scripture of Wisdom* and the *Upper Petition for Dispelling Demons with Numinous Medicines*.

It is also said that the Golden Portal Emperor once sat in attendance and questioned him—this being another title of Lord Lao. At other times, he visited the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Tenuity or paid homage to the Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Subtlety. All the *Great Cavern Scripture of the Supreme Clarity*, the *Divine Talismans and Precious Petitions for Summoning Spirits and Vanquishing Demons*, he recorded and held.

These scriptures are all woven from the naturally arising qi of soaring mystery, forming numinous texts. Their Dao is lofty and wondrous, the most exalted of all scriptures, unifying the ten thousand perfected beings and commanding the immortals of the grasses. They are concealed above the Nine Heavens, in the Palace of Great Existence, within golden halls aglow with purple radiance and jade chambers suffused with luminous splendor. Golden tablets were cast to inscribe the numinous texts, or else white jade was inscribed with cinnabar to clarify their chapters. Some are stored in the Numinous Capital of the Grand Subtlety, in the jade chambers of the Jasper Palace, guarded by seven thousand fierce beasts—poisonous dragons and divine tigers. Within the jade portals, golden dawns and jade youths, pure numinous maidens—three thousand each—stand guard over the numinous texts. The host of perfected beings hold office, the ten thousand sages pay court, jade steps and cloud canopies fill the celestial courts, the Heavenly Emperor defers in humility at the foot of his dais, and the Jade Sovereign alters his measures to propel the revolutions. The Dipper’s handle turns to direct the spirits.

The Great Dao Sovereign then ascends the Terrace of the Gifted Crag, the Chamber of Nine Turns, and leads the Ninefold Primordial Golden Portal Emperor of Later Worthies to fast for three months, then receive the transmission in accordance with the covenant. When the great kalpa completes its cycle, the Three Dao wax and wane, the Two Qi separate and unite, the end returns to the beginning, and the revolutions proceed without error. In the age of the Tang, during the calamity of the Nine Yang, he swept away the perverse and rebellious, gathering the worthy from on high.

At that time, those who cultivated the *Great Cavern Scripture of the True* delved into the profound gate of singular concentration, applied the Eight Paths to summon the perfected, refined the golden efflorescence of the Three Origins, recited the pure numinous in seclusion, marshaled the Five Phases to summon the soul, wore the tiger talisman of the Golden Spirit, shifted the Seven Stars to the Celestial Pass, grasped the mysterious names in the Emperor’s Chart, established the Azure Record in the Supreme Clarity, bound the jade essence to form the network, nurtured the jade embryo to internalize the numinous, severed worldly attachments upon the eternal heights, and guarded solitude in natural stillness. Thus, they could receive the true transmission of the Eight Effulgences, receive the wondrous instructions in the golden petitions, apply the summoning of spirits through the curved characters, and deploy the vast and open to command the spirits. They rescued the seven ancestors from the dark palace, causing the Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties to vanish in an instant.

Those who obtain these texts ascend beyond the Nine Heavens, penetratingly beholding the Three Essences.

Without the proper recipient, these teachings shall remain untransmitted through endless kalpas. Those of shallow learning, how could they fathom the vastness of the Dao or realize that enlightenment lies in focused contemplation? Though their efforts may accumulate like dust and sand, they but weary themselves in vain, never achieving resonance between inner and outer, and through a single moment of delusion, they fall into the cycles of rebirth and retrogression.

Thus, I have here transcribed and compiled the Jade Writ of the Supreme August to impart to you: choose the worthy for transmission. These dharma treasures are secret and foundational to the myriad Dao. Follow the luminous precepts, and the host of perfected ones shall oversee your ascent. Should you lightly disclose or treat them with disdain, calamity shall extend to your ancestors for generations. How could one not be cautious?

**Illustrated Charts of Immortals**
The illustrated records of scriptures and images derive from the lineage of masters, constituting the arcane words of the supreme sages and the essential pointers for cultivation. Thus, the Three Departments, Eight Effulgences, and Twenty-Four Spirits all reside within the human body, each possessing its own image. Practicing in accordance with these charts brings immediate resonance and communion.

In ancient times, the Primordial Beginning transmitted them to the Later Sage Lord, that they might spread throughout the realms of humans and heavens. This Later Sage Lord was none other than Lord Lao. In the first year of the Supreme August era, on the tenth day of the ninth month—the Supreme August being a celestial title—this appellation arose among humankind. Those of limited knowledge, unaware of its origin, often dismiss this title.

Traveling to the Western River and surveying the eight directions, he encountered the Primordial Beginning Heavenly King, who rode an Eight-Effulgence Jade Chariot, drawn by nine-colored dark dragons, with threefold white clouds and a retinue of perfected immortals. In his hand he held a floral banner, while lions and white cranes sang in harmonious chorus, floating through the void to descend upon the Western River. The Later Sage Lord bowed in reverence and inquired:

"Formerly, I received the celestial jade graphs of the twenty-four charts, and though I obtained the texts, I have not grasped their subtleties. Though I possess the illustrated eulogies, I lack their images. In my cultivation, I grope in obscurity, unable to discern the ford. Now, having encountered the Heavenly Worthy, my joy is beyond words. I humbly beseech your completion of this teaching and revelation of the true Dao."

Thereupon, the Heavenly King exhaled the Jade Talisman of Internal Vision from the Cavernous Origin and bestowed it upon the Lord, instructing him to purify himself with a thousand-day retreat, to suffuse his body with numinous incense, and to ingest the talisman while facing east. Thus, his form and spirit would fully manifest, and all obstructions would instantly dissolve.

The Lord bowed in reverence and complied, observing the celestial rites with a thousand-day retreat, ingesting the talisman while facing east. The gods of the Three Departments and Eight Effulgences all appeared, and the twenty-four charts of golden script and jade graphs shone brilliantly in the void, utterly unobstructed. At that moment, he commanded the Chief Scribe of the Illustrated Charts among the Perfected Immortals to inscribe the images. Golden script in purple characters and jade graphs in cinnabar seals thus took form.

Thereafter, the Lady of the Nine Radiant Lights of the Supreme Prime of the Southern Culmen, the Perfected Lords of the Eastern and Western Flowers, the True Dukes of the South and North, the divine immortals of the Five Marchmounts, and the Perfected of Pure Emptiness—all received the true writs and illustrated charts from the Later Sage Lord. The Later Sage Lord’s transmission is recorded in the *Arrayed Annals of the Three Heavens*.

The Twenty-Four Charts are as follows:
**Upper Eight:**
1. *Chart of Bathing in the Eastern Well*
2. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals and True Forms of the Five Marchmounts*
3. *Chart of Communing with the Numinous and Refining the Eight Histories*
4. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals and the Six Jia’s Communion with the Numinous*
5. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals and the Purple Chambers of the Nine Palaces*
6. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals and the Primordial Beginning’s Supreme Clarity*
7. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals and the Dao’s Primal Unification*
8. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals’ Western Ascent and Preservation of the Record*

**Middle Eight:**
1. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals’ Subtle Spiritual Transformations*
2. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals Treading the Void and the Nine Numinous*
3. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals’ Ninefold Celestial Transformations*
4. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals’ Constant Preservation*
5. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals’ Guarding the One and Nurturing the Body*
6. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals’ Guarding the Spirit and Abiding in Effulgence*
7. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals’ Quiescent Cultivation of Essence and Guarding the Will*
8. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals and the Jade Maidens of the Mushroom Flowers*

**Lower Eight:**
1. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals and the Six Yin Jade Maidens*
2. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals’ Ninefold Primordial Guidance*
3. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals’ Dao-Yin*
4. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals and the Cavernous August Treasure*
5. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals’ Transformations and Concealments*
6. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals’ Gathering Mushrooms and Opening Mountains*
7. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals’ Bright Mirror*
8. *Chart of the Perfected Immortals and the Boundless Supreme One*

These twenty-four charts arose from the dark transformations of the Cavernous Heaven’s Primordial Beginning. Practicing them in accordance with their instructions, and further elucidating them with the sublime pointers of the various sages, one embodies the Dao, which responds to all things without discrimination, and the sage, who attends to resonance and adapts to conditions. Thus, through scriptures, charts, precepts, and disciplines, one transforms all beings, manifesting in myriad responsive forms without limit. Yet the embodiment of the Most High remains serene and non-active, neither arising nor ceasing.

**Transmission of the Scriptural Treasury**
The thirty-six revered scriptures originated with the cloud-seal compositions at the kalpa’s dawn, comprising the concealed language of the Great Brahma and the admonitions of the various sages. They are the subtle guideposts of the wondrous Dao and the healing stones for humans and heavens. In sum, there are thirty-six divisions; in detail, eighteen thousand scrolls. Treasured within golden script and jealously guarded by the sagely perfected, they are the root of all writing and the guiding principles of the myriad dharmas.

Thus, the Later Sage Lord declared: "The precious scriptures of the Supreme August are composed of spontaneous chapters, through which the Dao of long life and the methods of immortality are practiced. Talismans, jade instructions, and secret seals originated with the Nine-Heaven King and were transmitted through the perfected ones of successive kalpas. By the time of the Three and Five’s transformation of destiny and the Nine Numinous’ response to the era, I had examined and collated the original texts through ninety myriads of billions and ninety thousand kalpas. The codes of the Supreme August often did not align. Therefore, on the first day of the third month of the first year of the Middle August, within the Golden Tower of the Jade Clarity Heaven, I commanded the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea to seek the standards of celestial observation, to examine and collate the celestial patterns, and to compile the numinous scrolls into three hundred volumes of precious scriptures, seven thousand chapters of talismanic charts, and nine thousand scrolls of jade instructions. These I entrusted to the Prime Minister, the Azure Lad, that he might transmit them to those of later learning who harmonize with the true."

As for the *Shangqing* (Supreme Clarity): During the era of the Upper Three August Ones, when humanity remained unadorned in simplicity, Lord Lao, in the first year of the Dragon Han, styled himself the Master of the Mysterious Center and expounded the twelve divisions of the *Shangqing* sagely teachings to deliver the beings of heaven and earth.

As for the *Lingbao* (Numinous Treasure): During the era of the Middle Three August Ones, Lord Lao, in the first year of the Red Brightness, styled himself the Venerable Master of Antiquity and descended with the twelve divisions of the *Lingbao True Scripture* to transform and deliver all beings, rescuing the multitudes of humanity.

The *Dongshen* (Cavernous Divine): During the era of the Lower Three August Ones, when human hearts had scattered from their pristine simplicity, Lord Lao, in the first year of the Kaihuang reign, styled himself the Sovereign of the Golden Gate and revealed the twelve divisions of the *Dongshen Scripture* to deliver the myriad classes of beings, collectively known as the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.

Moreover, the first is called *Dongzhen* (Cavernous Perfection), the second *Dongxuan* (Cavernous Mystery), and the third *Dongshen* (Cavernous Divine), each comprising twelve openings, together forming the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures. Above, they correspond to the Three Clarities and thirty-six heavens; in the middle, they correspond to the Three Realms and thirty-six emperors; below, they correspond to the nine ramparts and thirty-six earthly sovereigns. Internally, they resonate with the thirty-six palaces of the human body. Thus, the human head has nine palaces, the heart nine apertures, the navel nine spirits, and the form nine portals—altogether thirty-six loci, externally harmonizing with the thirty-six sounds.

As the *Nanhua Scripture* states: "My master! My master! Who slays the myriad things yet deems it no cruelty, whose blessings extend through ten thousand generations yet deems it no benevolence." Here, Zhuang Zhou takes the Dao as his master. When Laozi abides in heaven, he takes the Great Dao Lord of Jade Clarity as his master; when he descends among humanity, he takes Chang Cong as his master. Even the sagely Laozi could not dispense with the transmission of teachings—how much less could those who are not Laozi?

The *Book* states: "Affairs that do not take antiquity as their teacher cannot endure through the ages." Moreover, those who awaken first are learned in the past and discern the present, sufficiently serving as models. In cultivating the self and governing the world, they attain longevity and durability. Thus, from the Three August Ones and Five Emperors onward, Laozi altered his names and titles, all to uphold the world and establish teachings, transmitting them to the people of the world.

During the time of Fuxi, when humanity had grown dissolute yet lacked laws and institutions, Lord Lao styled himself Master Yuhua, descending as teacher to expound the *Yuanyang Scripture*. He instructed them in drawing the eight trigrams and creating written characters to communicate the virtue of spiritual illumination and categorize the conditions of the myriad things. Gazing upward, they observed the patterns in heaven; looking downward, they examined the models on earth—thus began the civilizing teachings.

During the time of Shennong, when people hunted birds and beasts, consuming raw flesh and drinking blood, Lord Lao styled himself Master Dacheng, descending as teacher to expound the *Yuanjing Scripture*. He taught them the Dao of nurturing life: sowing the hundred grains to replace the cooking of living things, harmonizing the hundred medicines to cure the hundred illnesses. From tasting mulberry, he obtained millet; from tasting willow, rice; from tasting elm, glutinous millet; from tasting locust, beans; from tasting peach, wheat; from tasting hawthorn, barley; from tasting thorn, hemp. Once the five grains were cultivated, they sustained human life. He halted the slaughter of birds and beasts, separating and grouping them by kind, fostering goodness and restraining evil to preserve their lives. Abstaining from blood and flesh, they avoided karmic entanglements. Thus began the teaching of cherishing life.

During the time of Zhurong, when people ate raw and cold food, unaware of fire’s transformative power, they suffered many illnesses. Lord Lao styled himself Master Guangshou, descending as teacher to expound the *Anmo Tongjing Scripture*. He taught them the Dao of pacifying the spirit: drilling wood to produce fire, molding and casting vessels to transform raw and cold food, thereby preserving human longevity. Thus began the arts of pottery and metallurgy.

After Fuxi, Lord Lao demonstrated worldly methods: establishing rites and music to distinguish honor and humility, crafting garments to clarify nobility and baseness, constructing palaces to replace nests and caves, building boats and carts to traverse impassable distances, providing coffins and outer coffins to spare the living from burial in firewood, forging bows and arrows to overawe the disobedient, instituting penal laws to deter violence, creating written characters to replace knotted cords. They harnessed oxen and rode horses to transport heavy loads over long distances, established markets at midday for exchange before departing, and devised the benefits of plows and pestles, the regulations of double gates and watchmen’s clappers—all originated from this.

During the time of the Yellow Emperor, Lord Lao styled himself Master Guangcheng. The *Nanhua Scripture* states: "After the Yellow Emperor had reigned as Son of Heaven for nineteen years, with his decrees circulating throughout the world, he heard that Master Guangcheng dwelled atop Mount Kongtong and went to visit him. He said: 'I have heard that you, Master, have attained the utmost Dao. I venture to ask about the essence of the utmost Dao. I wish to gather the essence of heaven and earth to assist the five grains and nourish the people.'"

"I further wish to govern the yin and yang to nurture the growth of grasses—how may this be done?"

Master Guangcheng replied: "What you wish to inquire about is the substance of things. What you wish to govern is but their remnants. Since you have taken charge of the world, the clouds gather without waiting to assemble before raining, grasses and trees wither without waiting to yellow, and the light of the sun and moon grows ever more dim. With a heart as flattering as yours, how could one like you, who severs the myriad things, be worthy to speak of the utmost Dao?"

The Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquished the world, built a solitary chamber, spread a mat of white cogon grass, and secluded himself for three months. He then returned to seek the Master again. Master Guangcheng turned his head to the south and faced outward. The Yellow Emperor descended with the wind, advanced on his knees, bowed twice, prostrated himself, and asked: "I have heard that you, Master, have attained the utmost Dao. I venture to ask how one may cultivate the body to attain longevity."

Master Guangcheng rose with a frown and said: "An excellent question indeed! Come, I shall tell you of the utmost Dao. The essence of the utmost Dao is profound and obscure. Its ultimate state is dim and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness—then the body will naturally align. Be still, be pure; do not weary your form, do not agitate your essence, and you may attain long life. Let your eyes see nothing, your ears hear nothing, your heart know nothing—then your spirit will guard your form, and your form will endure. Guard your inner self, shut out the outer; excessive knowledge brings ruin. I have led you to the radiance of great clarity, to the source of utmost yang. I have guided you through the gate of profound obscurity, to the source of utmost yin. Heaven and earth have their offices, yin and yang their repositories—guard your body well, and the myriad things will flourish of themselves. I preserve the One and dwell in harmony; thus I have cultivated my body for one thousand two hundred years, yet my form has never declined."

The Yellow Emperor bowed twice and prostrated himself, saying: "Master Guangcheng may be called heaven itself."

Master Guangcheng said: "Come, I shall tell you more. Those things are inexhaustible, yet people all regard them as finite. They are unfathomable, yet people all regard them as limited. Those who attain my Dao may ascend as sovereigns or descend as kings. Those who lose it may see light above yet become dust below. Now, the hundred creatures all arise from the earth and return to it. Thus, I shall leave you and enter the gate of the boundless, to wander the wilds of the infinite. I share the radiance of the sun and moon, I am constant with heaven and earth. When I draw near, all is bright; when I withdraw, all is dark. People may all perish, yet I alone endure."

The Yellow Emperor practiced this, and the world was greatly ordered. After a long time, he journeyed to Qingqiu, where he met the Master of the Purple Mansion, the Perfected One of Central Yellow, the Great Lord Chen, the Youth of the Yellow Canopy, the Master of Green City’s Nurturing, and the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of Mount Emei—all had attained the true oral instructions. He cast a tripod at Mount Xing, rode a dragon, and ascended to heaven in broad daylight, with seventy-two officials ascending alongside him.

The Primordial One further expounded the *Scripture of Daoist Precepts* and transmitted the Dao to three men: Tian Lao, Li Mu, and Feng Hou, all of whom attained the Dao. The Queen Mother of the West bestowed upon the Emperor five jade statues, saying: "These are the images of the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning." She also transmitted to him the *True Form Chart of the Two Modes*, which the Emperor received and placed in a lofty observatory, offering rare incense, famous flowers, and countless treasures morning and evening. Even his consorts and chief ministers were not permitted to behold them. Above the observatory, clouds of wondrous hues often gathered, suffused with celestial fragrance—this was called a *Daoist abbey*. The term *Daoist abbey* began here. The Emperor had over three hundred detached palaces and villas in renowned mountains and grotto-heavens, all of which he converted into Daoist abbeys. Each abbey was assigned seven Daoist practitioners for cultivation.

During the reign of Emperor Zhuan, Lord Lao descended as his teacher, styled Master Red Essence, and dwelled on Mount Heng. He transmitted the *Scripture of Subtle Words* and taught the way of loyalty and compliance. During the reign of Emperor Yu, Lord Lao descended as his teacher, styled Master Record Chart, and dwelled by the riverside. He transmitted the *Scripture of the Yellow Court* and taught the way of purity and harmony. During the reign of Emperor Yao, Lord Lao descended as his teacher, styled Master Accomplished Labor, and dwelled on Mount Gushe. He transmitted the *Scripture of the Separation and Union of Governance* and taught the way of integrity and prudence. During the reign of Emperor Shun, Lord Lao descended as his teacher, styled Master Yin Shou, and dwelled in Heyang. He transmitted the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue* and taught the way of non-action and purity. From this arose the two scriptures, the *Upper* and the *Lower*.

During the time of Yu of Xia, Lord Lao descended as his teacher, styled Master True Conduct, and dwelled on Mount Shang. He transmitted the *Scripture of Virtue’s Precepts* and taught the way of diligence and frugality. He also bestowed the *Five Talismans of the Numinous Treasure* and the methods for summoning spirits and ghosts, enabling Yu to dredge the Nine Rivers, dam the hundred streams, and connect the boiling seas. During the time of Tang of Shang, Lord Lao descended as his teacher, styled Master Bestowed Principle, and dwelled on Mount Man. He transmitted the *Scripture of Longevity* and taught the way of reverence and love. Tang practiced this, regarding others as himself and extending his kindness even to insects.

Later, in the eighteenth year of King Yang Jia of Shang, the year *gengshen*, the Most High harnessed nine dragons, divided his body, and descended in the land of Chu, in the hamlet of Qu Ren of Lai County in Ku County. He was conceived in the womb of the Mysterious and Wondrous Jade Maiden and remained there for eighty-one years. In the ninth year of King Wu Ding, the year *gengchen*, on the fifteenth day of the second month, he was born. Because he pointed to a plum tree and took the surname Li, and because he could walk and speak at birth while already white-haired, he was called *Laozi*. He then instructed his attendants on the origins of the hundred diseases and the essentials of the hundred remedies, enabling the people of the world to preserve their lives. He also revealed the safeguards of the Three Luminaries and Three Origins, the methods of the Five Phases and Five Teeth, the way of preserving the spirit and securing the form, and the techniques of inner and outer cyclically transformed elixirs and golden fluid—all to attain long life.

Then he transcended the Three Realms, ascended the Nine Heavens of Pure Clarity, rose to the sacred rank, and eradicated the root of death—without end, without beginning, eternally enduring. Thus Bian Shao, in his *Stele of the Sacred Mother*, wrote: "In true virtue, he embraced emptiness and guarded purity. Content in a lowly station, he sought neither rank nor power." Here ends the second scroll of the *Tradition of the Hidden Dragon*.

**Scroll Three of the *Tradition of the Hidden Dragon***
Compiled by Jia Shanxiang, Left-Street Supervisor of the Daoist Teachings, Grand Master of Lofty Virtue and Enlightened Perfection, under the Edict of the Bureau of Ritual Affairs

**The Era of Descent**
Lightning coiled around the central pillar, dragons played at the gates—such were the signs at the birth of a sage. Without the proper time, there would be no descent; without sageliness, there would be no marvel. Thus, when Shuliang He prayed at Niqiu, a response was felt—such was the time. When Jiang Yuan abandoned Hou Ji, no harm came to him—such was the marvel. Surveying the former sages, most followed this pattern. Yet discrepancies in dates, differences in sequence, and conflicting accounts often arise, and indeed they do exist. Only the descent of the Old Master remains vividly recorded in the treasuries of scriptures and in the transmitted records of earlier scholars, allowing verification. Here, these events are arranged in order, that future generations may not be led astray.

The Lord Lao, pitying the world’s decay, wished to return in spirit and descend into birth. In the seventeenth year of King Yang Jia of the Shang, the year *gengshen*, he entrusted his conception to the Wondrous Jade Maiden. From conception to birth, there were twenty-one wondrous events:

1. The Great Dao responded to transformation, entrusting conception to the human realm. It transformed the essence of the sun into a five-colored pearl, manifesting the yang virtue.
2. Riding a chariot drawn by nine dragons, he condensed and transformed, their five hues intertwining and flowing into the mouth of the Wondrous Jade Maiden—this revealed the radiance of the nine dragons’ yang clarity. Today, the Flowing Star Altar remains in Tianjing Palace, Chengfu County, Bo Prefecture.
3. The gestation and nurturing differed from former sages: eighty-one years, fulfilling the supreme yang number of nine nines, before his birth.
4. The Wondrous Jade Maiden, napping by day, dreamed of swallowing a five-colored flowing pearl and thus conceived. Her complexion grew ever more youthful, her spirit serene, and for eighty-one years, she remained unparalleled in joy—this marked the strangeness of the sage’s descent.
5. In the chamber where the Wondrous Jade Maiden dwelled, the four seasons harmonized, the six qi balanced. Winter brought no biting cold, summer no oppressive heat. Auspicious light illuminated the room, numinous winds filled the courtyard. No evil approached, and myriad spirits guarded in secret. Eighty-one years passed unnoticed, until in the ninth year of King Wu Ding of the Shang, the year *gengchen*, he was born.
6. His birth differed from former sages: though conceived within the sacred mother, he emerged by splitting open her left armpit.
7. At his birth, he took nine steps, each step birthing a lotus flower. The earth exuded fragrance, greatly manifesting divine marvels.
8. On the day of his birth, the sun-child radiated brilliance, the moon-lady scattered blossoms. The Seven Origins streamed light, auspicious clouds shaded the courtyard. The Four Spirits stood in resplendent guard, jade maidens received him, and as the sacred mother grasped a plum branch, he suddenly descended.
9. At his birth, ten thousand cranes soared in the sky, nine dragons spat water to bathe his sacred form. Where the dragons emerged, nine wells formed, which remain today in Taiqing Palace, Weizhen County, Bo Prefecture. When one well is drawn from, all nine stir.
10. After his birth, the Lord Lao pointed to heaven with his left hand and to earth with his right, saying: "Above heaven and below heaven, only the Dao is supreme. The sufferings of the world—how can they be worth delighting in?"
11. The Lord Lao, pitying the world’s shallowness and the Dao’s failure to flourish, entrusted his spirit to birth to save the age.
12. As the foolish and deluded were difficult to transform and the true Dao hard to proclaim, he displayed extraordinary omens at his birth to inspire belief and awakening.
13. To clarify that awakening to the wondrous Dao leads to long life, he refined the golden elixir to encourage cultivation. Today, the Elixir-Refining Well and its cypress remain in the palace.
14. The Lord Lao taught people to study the Dao, cultivating both inner and outer. Having refined the golden elixir, he also practiced true qi. Today, the Hall of Emptiness and Non-Being remains intact through the ages—this was where the Lord Lao practiced qi.
15. To reveal that cultivating this wondrous Dao inevitably leads to ascension, he demonstrated his accomplishment by mounting a deer and lightly ascending. Today, the Deer-Track Cypress remains in the palace—this was where the Lord Lao rode a white deer to ascend to heaven. The cypress still stands.
16. The era of the Lord Lao’s birth was the ninth year of King Wu Ding of the Shang, the year *gengchen*, the fifteenth day of the second month.
17. The commandery and state of his birth were the ancient Chu state’s Ku County. Ku County took its name from the city, Lai Township from the waters, and Quren Village lay west of the Nine Wells, beside Ling Brook. The county was originally called Ku County. From the Han and Wei onward, it was named Guyang County. In the first year of the Qianfeng era, it was renamed Zhenyuan County. In the second year of the Zhonghe era, it was elevated to a Red County. Today, it is Weizhen County.
18. After his birth, within nine days, the Lord Lao grew nine feet tall, bearing the seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences—such as treading the Five Peaks and grasping the Ten, with fine brows and a square mouth, double pillars and triple depressions, sun corners and moon abysses—these were the features of the great sage.
19. After giving birth to the Lord Lao, the Sacred Mother mounted an eight-scene jade chariot, with immortals as attendants and guards, and ascended to heaven in broad daylight. The Great Tang posthumously honored her as the Primordial Heavenly Empress. Today, there is a palace called Dongxiao, north of Taiqing Palace in Weizhen County, and another on the Ascension Terrace at Louguan.
20. After the Lord Lao ascended to heaven, emperors of successive dynasties revered his true traces. King Mu of Zhou, the First Emperor of Qin, Emperor Huan of Han, and Emperor Wen of Sui all honored and repaired his palaces and temples, commanding scholar-officials to inscribe steles to commemorate his sacred traces.

Thus, the Han dynasty left the *Stele of Bian Zhao*, and the Sui dynasty the *Stele of Xue Daoheng*, both of which remain extant to this day.

21. As for the bestowal of the sacred title: the immortal embryo of Lord Lao gestated for eighty-one years. On the day of his birth, he emerged with white hair, and the Sacred Mother thereupon established his title to manifest it to the world. Within this section, five matters are distinguished.

First, the descent of the sage differs from that of common folk. The Sacred Mother wished to call him "old," yet he was newly born; she wished to call him "child," yet he bore white hair. Combining both characters, she thus established the title "Laozi."

Second, this clarifies that the Dao inverts the common. "Old" denotes longevity, while "child" signifies youth. Ordinary people are first young and then old, but Lord Lao was first old and then young, intending to reveal the return to the root by reversing the periphery.

Third, "old" signifies the examination and verification of all sages, while "child" denotes the generation of the myriad things. Thus, Lord Lao is the father and mother of the myriad things and the teacher and model of all sages, possessing the names of both examination and generation—hence the title "Laozi." The two characters "Laozi" originated at this time, though the name of Lord Lao existed myriad kalpas prior.

Fourth, the sage’s bequeathed name reverses end and beginning. "Old" is the end, and "child" the beginning. Ordinary people proceed from beginning to end, but Lord Lao proceeds from end to beginning, intending to instruct the world in cultivating the Dao, reverting from old age to infancy—hence the title "Laozi."

Fifth, he concealed his brilliance and harmonized with the world. "Old" was his title because he was born with white hair, while "child" is a general term for males, akin to Confucius, Mencius, Zhuangzi, Liezi, and others who took their surnames as titles, or like *Laozi*, *Ouguanzi*, *Baopuzi*, and *Huainanzi*, who adopted titles based on circumstances. The *Preface to the Scripture* states: "The title 'Laozi' began in numberless kalpas. Its profundity and remoteness stretch into the distant past, not arising from being titled 'old' upon birth. He existed myriad kalpas before humankind, hence the title 'old.' It signifies that, entrusting his spirit to Mother Li, he emerged from her left armpit at birth, already hoary—thus the title 'Laozi.' The title 'Laozi' emerged from the primordial, existing before heaven and earth, without a term of decline or age—hence 'Laozi.'" Such is the evidence of the *Preface to the Scripture*. Now, examining the various accounts, if the title was not established due to his birth, then Lord Lao, having taught through kalpas and manifested in the world, consistently appeared in an aged form—hence the title "Laozi."

Later generations claimed he was born during the Zhou dynasty, but this arose after the First Emperor of Qin’s burning of the books, when historical records preserved only the broad outlines. People, seeing that he transformed the world during the reigns of Kings Wen, Wu, Ping, Jing, You, and Li of Zhou, mistakenly asserted he was born in the Zhou era. In truth, he was born in the Shang dynasty. Had he been born during the reigns of Kings Ping, Jing, You, or Li, how could he have served as an archivist for Kings Wen and Wu? Thus, Xue Daoheng’s *Stele of the Great Clarity* states: "The True Origin served during the time of Kings Wen and Wu, holding the offices of *Cangshi* and *Zhushi*." This is a faithful record.

Now, according to Guan Yin’s *Annals of Lord Lao*, the *Inner Transmission of the Louguan by the Perfected of Great Harmony*, and Liu Xiang’s *Biographies of the Immortals*, he was born in the *gengchen* year of King Wuding of Shang—this is correct.

The *Genealogical Records* in the *Records of the Historian* are akin to what is here termed "genealogical lineage." All trace their origins, whether through enfeoffment or office, to derive their surnames. Thus, their descendants branched into separate lineages, each with its own root. Spanning myriad generations, their origins remain as clear as the palm of one’s hand—how could they be disregarded?

Carefully consulting the *Inner Transmission of Lord Lao* and various histories, all state that he was born beneath a plum tree and took "Li" as his surname—this is definitive. Now, according to the *Jade Decree of Celestial Evolution of the Great Tang*: "After Zhuanxu came Daye, and after Daye came Wa. Wa married a daughter of the Youqiao clan, who conceived Juexian after being struck by moonlight. Juexian begot Boyi. The descendants of Boyi served as judges for generations. During the chaos of Jie, Licheng fled to the ruins of Yi Hou, where he ate plum fruits and thus changed his surname to Li." This account states that the descendants of Juexian, having rendered service in adjudication, took the surname "Li." Later, their descendants altered it to "Li," and when they took refuge in the ruins of Yi Hou, they changed "Li" to "Li."

Cheng begot Lizheng, who lived during the time of Tang. Lizheng begot Changzu, who served as a grandee in Chen and resided in Ku County. Changzu begot Ming, who served as Prime Minister of Chen and was buried north of Lai Township, where a temple was erected—hence the name Xiang City. Ming begot Qingbin, and Qingbin begot Lingfei, also named Qianhui. Both Qingbin and Lingfei ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

The Chen state mentioned here is the ancient state of Chen, not the state enfeoffed to Hu Gongman during the Zhou dynasty. Now, from Tang to Yangjia, there were eighteen kings spanning over two hundred and fifty years. From Li Cheng to Qianhui, five generations succeeded one another, their eras aligning. During this time, after the fall of Da Hao, Chen became a state, and when the Zhou enfeoffed the descendants of Shun, it was this Chen. After its fall, the land was enfeoffed to Hu Gong.

Lingfei’s wife, the Mysterious and Wondrous Jade Maiden, dreamed of the essence of the sun and gave birth to Lord Lao—this is one account. Another version in the *Annals* states: "Lord Lao spoke at birth and pointed to the plum tree, saying, 'This is my surname.'" Xue Daoheng’s *Stele of the Courtyard of Lord Lao’s Shrine* states: "Born through the influence of the sun, the origin of his reception of the mandate remains unfathomable. That he took 'Li' as his surname is clear, though the root of his resonance with the pitch-pipes remains obscure."

The *Biographies of the Masters of Louguan* further states: Lord Lao was born as his holy mother grasped a plum tree, and he declared, "This is your surname." These three accounts are all recorded in the classics and traditions; here they are clarified together to illuminate the ancestral lineage of the Sage.

As for the Holy Mother, according to the *Records of the Mysterious Realm*, Li Lingfei lived during the Shang dynasty, and his father and son successively attained the Dao of nurturing life. His father, Qingbin, lived over a hundred years yet retained the appearance of youth. He wandered among the Five Peaks and the various mountains, returning to his dwelling each day, where clouds and dragons descended to welcome him, and he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Moved by his father’s extraordinary ascent, Lingfei withdrew from official service and cultivated the Great Dao in seclusion. He took the daughter of the Yin family of Tianshui as his wife and dwelt in Lai Village. His wife once, during a midday nap, dreamed that the heavens opened for several *zhang*, and a host of immortals bore forth the sun. After a long while, she saw the sun gradually diminish, descending from the sky and transforming into a five-colored pearl, the size of a pellet. In her dream, she obtained and swallowed it, thereby conceiving. After eighty-one years, she gave birth. Her complexion grew ever more youthful, perpetually like that of a maiden. Lingfei, too, lived over a hundred years before ascending to heaven.

After the birth of Lord Lao, was there not a five-colored cloud chariot that welcomed him to ascend to heaven? As for the origin of the Li surname, the *Inner Transmission of the Mysterious and Wondrous Jade Maiden, the Primordial Sovereign* further states: Lord Lao, in heaven, is the most revered among all sages; in the world, he is the master of all teachings. He enacted transformation before the kalpas of antiquity and abides in non-action, enduring without end. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy and Dao Lord bestowed upon him the true title "Lord Lao," a name he bore even before the Five Ultimates, and which has persisted through countless kalpas. Though he appears in every age as the teacher of emperors, no traces of his descent and birth in the world had been recorded. Therefore, from the highest of the Nine Heavens, he commanded the Mysterious and Wondrous Jade Maiden to descend among humanity, becoming the daughter of the Yin family of Tianshui and marrying Li Lingfei as his wife. As the Mysterious and Wondrous Jade Maiden napped at midday, Lord Lao rode the essence of the sun, driving nine dragons, and transformed into a five-colored flowing pearl, which entered her mouth, enabling her to conceive and give birth.

At birth, he pointed to the plum tree and said, "This is my surname." In the world, he bore nine names: first, Er, styled Boyang; second, Ya, styled Bozong; third, Zhong, styled Boguang; fourth, Shi, styled Menggong; fifth, Chong, styled Ziwen; sixth, Ding, styled Yuanyang; seventh, Yuan, styled Boshi; eighth, Xian, styled Yuansheng; ninth, De, styled Bowen. Some say he had thirty-six titles, others seventy-two names, or that his surnames and given names were too vast to record, spanning kalpas from one to the next. Lord Lao underwent nine transformations, emulating the generative power of the sun’s changes, and possessed seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences. Thus, he is the Sage among sages, the True One among true ones.

The Holy Mother, in heaven, was titled the Mysterious and Wondrous Jade Maiden; after giving birth to the Great Sage, she became the Primordial Sovereign of the Great One. The Primordial Sovereign then transmitted to Lord Lao the principles for transforming the world and propagating the teachings: the inner cultivation of the Nine Chambers and the Gates of the Three Ones, the precepts of myriad virtues and myriad evils, the formulas for a hundred illnesses and a hundred remedies, the rules of emptiness and purity, and the alchemical ingredients of the Nine Wells. These were to demonstrate to the world the methods of transmission from master to disciple. Yet how could the Most High and Great Sage, the master of all transformations, require instruction? This succession of sages merely illustrates the origins of their lineage.

Once the transmission of the Dao was complete, celestial music filled the skies, flowing clouds suffused the wilds, and a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders—along with the Five Emperors and the Perfected Ones of the Upper Realms—escorted the nine-radiant, eight-scene chariot to welcome the Primordial Sovereign of the Great One back to the Jade Clarity above. To this day, she remains the Primordial Sovereign of the Great One. The Tang dynasty honored her as the Primordial Heavenly Empress.

Examining the origins of the Holy Mother as recorded in various sources, it is clear that the Mysterious and Wondrous Jade Maiden was the mother of Lord Lao, and her identity as the Primordial Sovereign of the Great One is the most authoritative account. As for the era of his descent, the reign of King Wuding of the Shang is the most plausible. The remaining accounts contain discrepancies and contradictions, with inconsistencies before and after; these are recorded here but not adopted.

The seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences—Fuxi with a serpent’s body, Shennong with an ox’s head, Yao with eight-colored brows, Shun with double pupils—all are the supreme features of the great sages, by which they are set apart. Thus, when the Master Lao was born, he emerged in wondrous mystery, unique and rare beyond compare; no sage of past or present dared liken himself to him, for he was truly extraordinary. As the ancients said: “Only with an extraordinary person do extraordinary deeds arise.” Thus he could emerge from the unfathomable and enter the unseen, his transformations beyond reckoning. Tracing his supreme marks, they encompass the full count of nine nines.

According to the *Dharma-Wheel Sutra*: The Lord Lao’s head is round, modeling Heaven; his crown resembles Kunlun’s heights. His hair coils in dense clouds, his jade-like nape rises high. His hair is white as a crane’s, over seven feet long; his tiger-like whiskers and dragon-like beard are pure and silken. His brows are like the Northern Dipper, their color a verdant green. Between them, purple hairs grow over five inches long. His ears lack outer rims, with three openings within, rising level with his crown, thick and firm. His river-like eyes are bright and penetrating, their pupils glowing with the sun’s purple radiance. His square pupils are clear and luminous, their centers veined with green. His nose has twin pillars, shaped like cut bamboo. His mouth is square as the sea, his lips as if brushed with cinnabar. His beard is purple-black, fragrant as orchids. His teeth are like contained cowries, strong as silver, numbering forty-eight?—even and aligned above and below. His tongue is long and broad, patterned like brocade. Jade-like saliva overflows, its taste sweet and fragrant. When he speaks, his voice rings like gold and jade. His cheeks resemble transverse ridges, his chin a level mound. His forehead bears the sun’s prominence, his temples the moon’s depths. His face bears rhinoceros patterns in straight lines, his dragon-like countenance shifts with divine change. His golden complexion is yellow-hued, his jade-like skin lustrous. His brow has three lines, converging upward. His celestial court is broad and full, his face square and long-lived. His abdomen bears a white mark, his chin a jade-like orb. His neck has three folds, his crane-like neck is tall and proud. His arms hang past his knees, his hands grasp the ten signs. His fingers bear jade-like nails, his body is covered in green hair. His back bears the River Chariot, his chest the recumbent bones. His heart has nine apertures, its exterior patterned like brocade. His navel is an inch deep, his belly soft as silk. His feet are square as a carpenter’s square, his soles patterned like wheels. His steps tread the two fives, his toes bear the signs of Heaven and Earth. Within, his blood is white; without, he appears aged. His body is twelve feet tall, his frame fragrant and lush. He walks with a tiger’s stride, moves with a dragon’s haste.

These are the seventy-two marks. To his left, the Azure Dragon attends; to his right, the White Tiger guards. Above his head, the Vermilion Bird is born; beneath his feet, the Dark Warrior treads. His body is hard as gold, his appearance like red jade. A fivefold radiance encircles him, his head bears purple-black hues, his chest the true character.

These are the nine excellences. Combined with the seventy-two marks, they make the eighty-one excellences.

The Archivist Sima Jizhu said: “The higher the Dao, the greater the peace; the higher the position, the greater the peril.” Truly, these words are apt. Confucius served as a grandee, and the Han Ancestor began as a petty constable—yet their aspirations lay in bringing order and enacting the Way. Did they choose their paths for advancement? If one feels shame at a lowly rank or meager stipend and seeks to rival the exalted, one only invites blame upon oneself. How then can one perfect sagely virtue to transmit to later ages and endure as long as Heaven and Earth? Thus, the Master Lao’s descent to the frontier was no different.

When King Wen was the Earl of the West, he was called the Child of Xieyi. At that time, Emperor Xin’s tyranny plunged the realm into suffering. The Lord Lao rode a flying maple chariot, with the Wind Earl as his vanguard and Pengzu as his attendant, descending on the southern slope of Mount Qi. Hearing of this, the Earl of the West bowed and appointed him Archivist, composing the *Scripture of the Crimson Essence* to teach the Way of benevolence and trust. The Earl practiced this, honoring worthies and cherishing righteousness, and phoenixes and unicorns gathered. When King Wu overthrew Shang, he was called the Child of Yucheng, and the Lord Lao was transferred to the post of Pillar Archivist, composing the *Scripture of the Turning Mechanism*. He also transmitted the Dao to the Duke of Zhou.

In the time of King Cheng, he served as Preceptor, known as the Child of Jingcheng. In the time of King Kang, he served as Preceptor, known as the Child of Guoshu, again holding the post of Pillar Archivist. Like a hidden dragon in a lowly rank, he stabilized the Zhou dynasty. In the time of King Zhao, the Supreme Lord again commanded the Lord Lao to enlighten the Western Extremity. Thereupon, he retired from office, transmitting the *Upper and Lower Chapters* to Guan Yin.

Since the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, each emperor has served as his disciple. In every region, he established teachings, spreading seventy-two transformations and transmitting essential scriptures. Those who cultivated them all extended their years and prolonged their lives. Yet from the beginning of creation to the end of kalpas, whether he appeared or remained hidden, his manifestations cannot be confined to a single form.

When the Zhou state was well-ordered, he appeared; when it was disordered, he concealed himself—this has been the way of sages past and present. Tracing his withdrawals and advances, his responses to order and chaos: when hidden, he transcended the world; when advancing, he aided rulers and upheld the mandate. When retreating, he soared high and plunged deep. How much more so for the vast and true person, who unites life and death, merges with Heaven and Earth, harmonizes with the primordial, blends with the divine, roams the realm of carefree wandering, and grasps the handle of creation?

When he enters, he encompasses the six directions, without inner or outer. When he emerges, he responds to and nurtures the myriad things, without regard for great or small.

Some say: “The Master Lao was a sage, yet his office never exceeded that of Archivist.” This is the view of the vulgar world. The True Person of Southern Florescence said: “The essence of the Dao is for cultivating the self; its remnants are for ordering the state; its dregs are for governing the world.” The sage knows how to cultivate the self, thus regarding the body as a temporary abode. How could the remnants and dregs trouble his true nature? Thus, whether advancing or retreating, gaining or losing—all is of himself. Moved only by compulsion, rising only when unavoidable—how could this be his fixed nature?

In the twenty-first year of King Zhou’s reign, the ding-mao year, the Most High resided on the southern slopes of Mount Qi, where he served as Keeper of the Archives. When King Wu conquered Shang, he was transferred to the post of Archivist Beneath the Pillars. Through the reigns of Kings Cheng and Kang, he then feigned illness and retired from office. On the twenty-ninth day of the fifth month, the ren-wu day, in the twenty-fifth year of King Zhao’s reign—the gui-chou year—he mounted a blue ox, harnessed a plain carriage, and had Xu Jia serve as his charioteer as he departed Zhou.

The *Record of the Green Sheep Palace* states: “He served as Keeper of the Archives, blending with the dust of the world; he fled the post of Archivist Beneath the Pillars to seclude himself at the frontier. Leaving behind the imperial court, he crossed west through the Hangu Pass, riding a carriage drawn by a blue ox, its wheels turning smoothly, and a chariot pulled by a white phoenix, drifting freely. Xu Jia held the reins, following the Transcendent Emperor to attend his arrival, while Yin Xi, gazing at the wind, knew the Dao Lord would surely come.”

Testing Xu Jia
The sage moves with compassion and responds to stimuli, taking the salvation of beings and the deliverance of things as his heart—how could he discriminate between high and low, noble and base, far and near, hidden and manifest? All are one to him. Thus, those who receive his gifts scatter without knowing their measure. Moreover, the ancients repaid even the smallest favor, yet Xu Jia, saved from death only to betray his promise, would surely be intolerable by human sentiment—how much less by the standards of divine clarity?

Long ago, one who drove the Most High’s carriage was named Xu Jia. The Old Lord said to him: “I wish to journey to the Western Sea, to Da Qin, Yanzhen, Tianzhu, Anxi, and other lands. If you drive my carriage, I will pay you a hundred coins per day. When I return from these lands, I will repay you in full with gold.” Xu Jia agreed and drove the carriage to the Hangu Pass. The Old Lord, wishing to test him, ordered Xu Jia to graze the blue ox in the wild, where he transformed auspicious grass into a woman of unmatched beauty. When she passed the grazing site, she teased him with words. Xu Jia, deluded, believed the Old Lord would travel far beyond the Flowing Sands and never return, so he broke their agreement. He falsified his words to the Pass Prefect, accusing the Old Lord and demanding his wages.

The Old Lord said: “You have followed me for over two hundred years. I owe you seven million two hundred thousand coins. Moreover, your life had already ended, but I revived you with the Talisman of Great Mystery. How could you forget this?” As he spoke, the talisman flew from Xu Jia’s mouth to the Old Lord’s hand, its script as fresh as new. Xu Jia then crumbled into white bones. The Pass Prefect, pitying Xu Jia for betraying his heart and dying again, wished to witness the Old Lord’s art of resurrection. He prostrated himself and said: “I will repay Xu Jia’s wages on his behalf. I beg the Great Sage to show mercy, absolve his transgressions, and grant him rebirth.”

The Old Lord heeded the Pass Prefect’s plea and cast the talisman into the bones, restoring Xu Jia as before. The Old Lord said: “I do not blame you. You broke our original agreement, and the Dao left you of its own accord—thus you died.” He then paid Xu Jia his wages and prepared to dismiss him. Xu Jia prostrated himself, striking his cheeks, and said: “I have bathed in the sagely compassion that pardoned my transgressions, allowing these dry bones to see the light again. I will carve this into my heart and bones. I wish to follow your cloud-borne carriage.” The Most High ultimately did not permit it.

Testing the Pass Prefect
More perilous than mountains and rivers, more inscrutable than the heavens—such is the human heart. Thus, good and evil cannot be fathomed even to a ten-thousandth part. For this reason, the ancients subjected those to whom they transmitted the Dao and its safeguards to twenty-five trials, measuring their worthiness. Even those of perfect conduct might harbor impure intentions, so tests were devised to examine their inner and outer selves before transmission could proceed. The Way of Lao and Zhuang is no different: merely knowing their words without internalizing them is not the wondrous attainment of solitary insight. Thus, Confucius said to his disciples: “If I praise someone, I must first test them.”

Moreover, the profound and wondrous Dao, the arts of divine transcendence—how could they be otherwise? According to the *Inner Transmission*: In the twenty-fifth year of King Zhao’s reign, the gui-chou year, on the ren-wu day of the fifth month, the Old Lord departed Zhou to seclude himself. Soon after, he wished to travel west beyond the Flowing Sands to transform the foreign lands. As he approached the Hangu Pass from the east, Yin Xi, a minister of King Zhao skilled in observing celestial portents, knew a sage would cross the pass and begged to be appointed its prefect. He purified himself, swept the roads, and burned incense to await the sage’s arrival.

On the twelfth day of the seventh month, the Old Lord, driving a carriage drawn by a blue ox with Xu Jia as his charioteer, was accompanied by the Venerable Limitless, Master Guigu, and the Venerable Supreme. As they crossed the pass, the Pass Prefect instructed the guard Sun Jing: “If anyone arrives with unusual attire or carriage, or bearing the appearance of foreign customs, do not let them pass.” On the twelfth day of the seventh month, the jia-zi day, an old man with white hair and long ears arrived, riding a plain carriage drawn by a blue ox.

The guard said: “The Prefect has given orders. Please tarry a moment.” He then entered to report: “An old gentleman driving a blue ox carriage has arrived from the east, seeking passage.” Yin Xi said: “The sage has come! I must see him.” He donned his court robes, went out to greet him, and bowed as a disciple, entreating: “I beg the sage to linger a while.” The Old Lord declined: “I am a poor, lowly old man. My home lies east of the pass, my fields west of it. I am merely passing through—why detain me? If you grant me passage, I will take nothing from you. Your earnestness is excessive; I can only await your courtesy.” Such was the Old Lord’s humble refusal—this was the first test.

Yin Xi prostrated himself again and said: “I do not believe you are merely traveling west. I beg you to linger a while.” The Old Lord replied: “I guide the land of Tianzhu. There is an ancient master there who embodies non-action, without end or beginning, extending through eternal kalpas. Thus, I ascend to join him. I am merely passing through the pass—why do you detain me so?” This was the second test.

Yin Xi said again: “Now that I behold the sage’s true form, so surpassing and transcendent, you are the Most Honored of Heaven. How could you journey to the barbarian lands?”

“I dare not speak falsely—only to beg your compassion.” The Old Lord asked again: “By what sign did you recognize me?”

Yin Xi replied: “Last winter, in the tenth month, the Star of Heavenly Principle moved westward past Xu. Then, from the first day of autumn, the melting winds came thrice, and in the southeast appeared a true blackness, shaped like dragons and serpents, crossing westward—these were the signs of a perfected one. From my youth I have studied celestial patterns and secret weft-texts; all that I observed above and examined below never failed to prove true. When the celestial portents appeared thus, I knew a sage would pass through the pass. From that moment, day and night I meditated without ceasing. Now, as if drawn by some Daoist affinity, I have indeed encountered your divine carriage. I beg you to bestow your compassionate instruction and deliver me from darkness.”

The Old Lord, seeing that he had passed all three tests, smiled warmly and said: “I knew you shared an affinity with the Dao, so I came to test you. Just as you have known me, so too have I known you.” Only after this threefold exchange did he permit Yin Xi to approach.

Thus the Four White-Haired Ones said: “Beholding Laozi and Yin Xi, how could one not awaken to the subtle workings of fate?” Yet his persistent humility was but a lesson for the world.

The Pass Prefect then prepared a seat in the official residence, performed the rites of a disciple, and served him facing north. The Old Lord asked: “Do you wish to transmit the great Dao to the world?”

Yin Xi replied: “As the Great Sage prepares to withdraw, I beg you to compose a text for me.” Thereupon he bestowed upon Yin Xi the two scrolls of the *Daode*, which, as the *Records of the Historian* states, comprise over five thousand words.

Sima Qian observed: Those who pursue yin-yang multiply confusion; Confucians, though learned, are burdened by cares; Mohists endure hardship and harm their nature; Logicians dazzle but lack substance; Legalists are harsh and unkind. Only the teaching of Laozi is called the great Dao—pure, empty, and non-active, it unifies the spirit and moves in accord with the formless, sustaining the myriad things. Its defense lies in adapting to the times, responding to things with transformation, suiting all circumstances. Its principles are concise and easily grasped, its tasks few yet its achievements many. Its practice is simple, though its words are profound. Taking emptiness and non-being as its root, following the natural course as its function, it forms no fixed power, assumes no constant shape, and thus can rescue the true nature of the myriad things. It neither precedes nor follows things, and so becomes their master. Therefore, the Yellow Emperor and Laozi were revered before the Six Classics, and the Daoist school alone was praised as pure and noble.

The Hangu Pass is located twelve *li* south of present-day Taolin County in Shanzhou. In the early Tianbao era, upon obtaining a divine talisman, it was renamed Lingbao County.

Emperor Zhenzong’s *Inscription on Crossing the Pass, with Preface* states: The mind of the sage is without preference or aversion; the realm of spiritual transformation may be obscure or manifest. If the legacy of the departed shines forth, the people will look up to it. The Hangu Pass was the path by which Laozi ascended to the west. As for one who embodies true virtue and expounds the teaching under a forced name, dwelling in the hidden chamber to preserve his authenticity, crossing the Flowing Sands to conceal his trace—Confucius questioned him on ritual and received subtle words; Yin Xi received the scripture and divined the true blackness. These events, recorded in earlier annals, have spread their influence to later ages. In this era of boundless longevity and the divine Dao, attaining the wondrous existence of the subtle is no easy matter. Beyond the slopes of Mount Hua, near the banks of the Yellow River, where the immortal’s chariot once passed, wheel tracks remain. Marking this with a pass and bridge reveals the barrier of Xiao and Han; establishing this county and town proclaims the blessings of Lingbao. Thus, though people pass away, the teaching endures; though ages change, the land remains. I, reverently offering sacrifice to the earth, undertake this timely progress. The wind of profound silence I ever contemplate; the governance of purity and tranquility I never forsake, following the ancestral master. To raise the dust of purity, I have this jade inscription carved. The inscription reads:

The Teaching Father concealed his truth,
His virtue matched the divine dragon.
When he journeyed in spirit,
Signs silently confirmed his insight.
The sage’s words shone forth,
Becoming the people’s model.
Gazing toward Hangu Pass,
Its traces endure at the frontier.
Boundless the mysterious and wondrous,
Unending the pure radiance.
The cloud-scripture is sealed,
The true inscription now engraved.

This occurred in the third year of the Dazhong Xiangfu era.

**The Pass Prefect Receives the *Daode* Scriptures**
When the sage establishes a teaching, he records it on bamboo and silk. Only when the right person appears does he transmit it, for as the *Divination* says: “If it is not the right person, the Dao will not spread in vain.” Huang Shigong bestowed the *Su Shu* upon Zhang Liang, enabling the rise of the great Han. How much more so Laozi’s teaching—pure, empty, and non-active, sustaining the myriad things—encompassing the Dao of governing body and state! That the Pass Prefect, having long shared an affinity with the Dao, received it in person is no accident.

The Pass Prefect was a grandee of Zhou, surnamed Yin, named Xi, styled Yangong, also called Gongwen. His mother, napping in the daytime, dreamed of lightning descending from heaven and coiling around her body, then entering her mouth, whereupon she conceived and gave birth to Xi. At his birth, twin lights like suns flew about his side. His eyes held the essence of the sun, and his form was majestic. Beyond mastering the ancient classics, he excelled in celestial patterns and secret weft-texts. Gazing above and examining below, he comprehended all, and even the transformations of ghosts and spirits could not conceal their truth from him. Magnanimous and heroic, he disregarded conventional rites, practicing kindness, frugality, and universal love, sacrificing himself to aid others. He served as a guest-friend in the Eastern Palace and was later appointed Prefect of Hangu Pass. Often gazing at the heavens, he harbored thoughts of ascending to the void.

Before the Old Lord’s arrival, Yin Xi built a thatched tower, ascending to gaze in all directions. Seeing in the east a purple cloud moving westward, he knew a perfected one would cross the pass. He ordered the gate officers to sweep, purify, and burn incense in anticipation. On the twelfth day of the seventh month, the *jiazi* day, the Old Lord arrived at the pass. Yin Xi knelt with hands clasped, bowing deeply, and invited him to his residence, offering towels, combs, and water for washing, then fasting and inquiring of the Dao. On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, he hung up his official cap and resigned his post. On the twenty-eighth day, he received the two scrolls of the *Daode*. As the Most High prepared to journey west beyond the Flowing Sands, Yin Xi kowtowed and begged to accompany him.

The Old Lord said: "You have not yet attained the Dao—how can you follow me? Beyond the Flowing Sands lies a foreign land, where fierce customs are difficult to transform. What arts do you possess to endure it? Only by ingesting the Dao into your belly can the numinous spirits all be preserved. If you can purge filth, still your thoughts, calm your mind, and guard the One, fasting purely for a thousand days to refine your form and enter the subtle, then you may seek me at the Green Sheep Market in Shu Commandery."

Yin Xi assented repeatedly and expressed his gratitude. Suddenly, the Old Lord ascended gently into the *Taiwei* constellation. For the Most High descends to transform the world below and dwells above in the *Taiwei* Palace, at the center of the *Gouchen*, where he is titled the Heavenly Thearch, the Radiant-Soul Treasure.

When Yin Xi beheld the light and vision disperse, leaving only emptiness and silence, he purified himself with fasting, dismissed his servants, and delved into the study of the true scriptures. For a thousand days, he concentrated his essence, preserving the Three Ones within the Three Palaces and penetrating the Nine Contemplations within the Nine Chambers. His mind congealed, his form dissolved, and flesh and bone wholly merged. Thereafter, he mastered the subtleties of numerology and transformation, the wonders of bodily transmutation—nothing remained unexhausted.

He then transmitted to Yin Xi the arts of the Golden Elixir and the Ninefold Cinnabar, as well as the *Taiqing Eight Talismans*, the *Observing Heaven’s Nine Capital Divine Elixir Golden Liquid*, and other scriptures, along with the principles of "one form, ten thousand spirits" and "ingesting qi," and the essentials of the Five Sprouts’ true qi.

Later, he returned to the northern slopes of Mount Zhongnan and built a thatched tower. Today, in the village of *Daowu* in *Shenlong* Township, *Wenxian* County, within the Fengxiang region of Mount Zhongnan, stands the thatched tower—the former abode of the Perfected Yin—still known as the *Louguan*. King Mu of Zhou later expanded and adorned it. The First Emperor of Qin erected a shrine before it, and Emperor Wu of Han established an official lodge to its north. From the Jin and Wei dynasties onward, the inscribed tablets remain.

Here now stands the inscription composed by the First Emperor of Qin, which reads:

*"The Great Dao flows boundless—how it may turn left or right!
When the Old Lord departed, he journeyed west; when he returned, he glanced east.
I now attend to Penglai and Yingzhou—may his radiance turn toward me!"*

In the second year of the Zhenguan era, the site was renamed *Zongsheng Abbey*. Thereafter, Yin Xi drifted away to the *Green Ram Market*, where he once more encountered the Most High.

According to the *Annals of the Primordial Origin*, the Most High ascended to heaven in the *jiayin* year. By the *yimao* year, he had divided his form and secretly descended into Shu, incarnating in the womb of a noble household. On the *dingsi* day, as Yin Xi arrived, Shu had no *Green Ram Market*. Yet when the Most High dwelled in the *Grand Tenuity*, he first dispatched the *Azure Lad* of the Green Emperor, who transformed into a green ram and descended upon Chengdu. Yin Xi, seeing a man leading the ram through the market, understood: *"Where there is a green ram, there too is its market."* This must be the place the Old Lord had appointed.

He inquired: *"To whom does this ram belong?"*
The man replied: *"My lady bore a son whose wailing would not cease. Neither fire nor water could harm him. A Daoist said that if he drank the milk of a green ram, his crying would stop—so I bought this ram."*
Yin Xi instructed: *"Tell your lady’s son that the Keeper of the Pass, Yin Xi, has arrived."*

The message was delivered, and the child rose from his nurse’s arms, straightened his robes, and said: *"Summon Xi to me."* When Yin Xi entered, the Most High stood over ten feet tall, his body golden, a halo circling his neck. He wore a crown adorned with the Seven Luminaries and a nine-colored robe. The household, seeing him, trembled in awe.

The Most High declared: *"This is the abode of the Grand Tenuity; my true body is the Primal Unity. The Supreme Harmony descends in purity, and the luminous spirit takes human form. Appearance and reality are one—why marvel?"*

Yin Xi prostrated himself and said: *"Who could have foreseen such fortune—to again behold the Celestial Countenance! May I ask, Exalted One, how you have fared since emerging from non-being into being?"*
The Old Lord replied with a smile: *"Since we parted, what have you gained or lost? You have preserved the Dao and guarded the One—has this not been of benefit?"*
Yin Xi answered: *"Since receiving your secret essentials, I have roughly grasped their wonders. Your grace in delivering me surpasses even heaven and earth."*
The Old Lord said: *"I once left you to dwell in the world, requiring a thousand days of pure fasting, that I might await you here. Now you have preserved your form and refined the Mysterious Black, attaining the profoundest subtleties. Your heart is bound with the Purple Net, your face radiates the Round Brilliance. Your golden name is inscribed in the True Register, and your jade tablet is tied to the Purple Chamber. You have aligned with the Grand Tenuity and dissolved your form to merge with the Real."*

As he finished speaking, the sages and perfected of the Three Realms arrived with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, descending through the empty sky. The Most High bestowed upon Yin Xi a *Purple Hibiscus Crown*, a *Flying Azure Feather Skirt*, *Cinnabar Sleeves with Green Cuffs*, a *Rainbow Sash*, and a *Silk Robe with Cloud Patterns and Yellow Ribbon*. He was then ordained as *Master of the Literary Beginning* and granted the title of *Unsurpassed Perfected*.

From that time forth, he was permitted to attend the Dragon Chariot and wander the world.

The *Record of the Green Ram* states: *"He urged the Azure Lad of the Green Emperor to transform into a ram in Shu Commandery, riding purple clouds from the Purple Palace and descending auspicious vapors upon the royal palace. To still the ceaseless wailing, the ram’s milk was needed at once. Suddenly, word came that Xi had arrived—and the infant’s cries ceased. From a newborn’s body, he reverted to a white-haired elder. In an instant, his form swelled to several *zhang*; in a moment, his face radiated fivefold light. Upon his head sat a crown of the Seven Luminaries, wrought with intricate jade; from his shoulders draped a nine-colored robe of finest silk. The countless jade-clad guards and the assembly of immortals—this was the very scene."*

The Most High ascended his seat and expounded the *Scripture of Primordial Yang* to the child’s mother. Today, the market lies several hundred paces southwest of Chengdu. In the second year of the *Zhonghe* era, the site where the numinous ram was obtained was identified, and an imperial decree established the *Green Ram Abbey*—the very place. There remain the *Descent Birth Terrace* and the *Primordial Yang Terrace*, their ruins still extant.

Later, the Most High manifested another body and journeyed with Yin Xi to the *Spirit Mountain* of Tianshui, where he once more expounded the essentials of the Dao. This is the present-day *Qiling Mountain* in Qinzhou, where the *Western Ascent Terrace* and the *Hall of the Sacred Countenance* stand beneath the cliffs.

They then traveled in secret across the Four Seas. First, they came to the Eastern Sea, to the *Sun’s Cavern*, *Changyang Mountain*, the *Fusang Tree*, the *Azure Sea*, the *Eastern Well*, the *Boiling Valley*, *Zu State*, the *Mushroom Fields*, the palaces of *Penglai* and *Fangzhang*. Next, they ascended southward to *Phoenix Mountain*, *Green Mound*, *Long Separation*, the *Crimson Ford*, the palace of *Great Cinnabar*, the *Vermilion Mountain*, *Cinnabar Mound*, and the lands of *Scarlet Tombs*. Then they entered the west, passing through *Tortoise Mountain*, the *Jade Watchtower*, *Human Crow*, *Phoenix Mountain*, *Kanlin*, *Unicorn Isle*, the *Golden Gate*, the *Jade Pool*, *Kunwu*, and the city of the *White Emperor*. Finally, they journeyed north into *Vast Obscurity*, the *Cavern of Shade*, *Primal Mound*, *Boundless Cold*, *Bell Mountain*, and the *Wilderness of No Inquiry*. They also ascended the *Central Marchmount*, *Kunlun*, the *True Garden*, and the palace of *Jasper Splendor*.

Immortals paid homage, celestial hosts came to greet them, and the transmission of the Dao and the bestowal of virtue followed each inquiry. Next, they traversed the Nine Heavens.

On the **First Heaven**, they met the *Heavenly Emperor of Wave Benefit*, who rode a chariot of *Ninefold Mystic Clouds*, shaded by a canopy of *Seven Primes and Intertwined Dawns*, bearing the *Five-Colored Banner for Subduing Demons*. His retinue included ninety thousand jade lads and jade maidens. He welcomed the Old Lord into the *Palace of Great Possession* and inquired after the *Dao of Spontaneity*.

On the **Second Heaven**, they met the *Heavenly Emperor of Joyous Purity*, who drove a chariot of *Flying Clouds of Azure Mist*, shaded by a canopy of *Five-Colored Phoenix Patterns*, bearing the *Sevenfold Banner of Commanding Dragons*. His retinue included fifty thousand jade lads and jade maidens. He welcomed the Old Lord into the *Jade Terrace of Phoenix City* and inquired after the *Unsurpassed Dao*.

On the **Third Heaven**, they met the *Heavenly Emperor of Brahma Treasure*, who rode a chariot of *Flowing Clouds of Supreme Spirit*, shaded by a canopy of *Sevenfold Radiant Dawns*, bearing the *Five-Colored Banner for Summoning Spirits*. His retinue included eighty thousand jade lads and jade maidens. He welcomed the Old Lord into the *Vermilion Palace of Yang Brightness* and inquired after the *Dao of Emptiness and Non-Being*.

Next they ascended to the **Fourth Heaven**, where they met the *Heavenly Emperor of Transformative Response*, who drove a chariot of *Sevenfold Radiant Yellow Clouds*, shaded by a canopy of *Fivefold Luminous Brocade Patterns*, bearing the *Seven-Colored Banner for Commanding Spirits*. His retinue included sixty thousand jade lads and jade maidens. He welcomed the Lord into the *Seven-Treasure Upper Palace* and inquired after the *Mysterious and Subtle Dao*.

Next they ascended to the **Fifth Heaven**, where they met the *Heavenly Emperor of Unyielding Joy*, who controlled a chariot of *Ninefold Azure Clouds of Spirit*, shaded by a canopy of *Flying Light and Frost Essence*, bearing the *Five-Colored Banner for Subduing Demons*. His retinue included seventy thousand jade lads and jade maidens. He welcomed the Venerable Lord into the *Nine-Layered Jade Terrace* and inquired after the *Supreme Mystery of the Great Dao*.

Next they ascended to the **Sixth Heaven**, where they met the *Heavenly Emperor of Doushu*, who rode a chariot of *Flowing Essence and Cinnabar Clouds*, shaded by a canopy of *Sevenfold Radiant Clouds of Dawn*, bearing the *Five-Colored Banner for Commanding Divinities*. His retinue included sixty thousand jade lads and jade maidens. He welcomed the Old Lord into the *Vermilion Palace of Spirit* and inquired after the *Utmost True Dao*.

Next they ascended to the **Seventh Heaven**, where they met the *Heavenly Emperor of Xuyan*, who rode a chariot of *Flying Splendor and Purple Clouds*, shaded by a canopy of *Five-Colored Gauze Patterns*, bearing the *Seven-Colored Banner for Summoning Perfected Ones*. His retinue included ninety thousand immortal lads and jade maidens. He welcomed the Old Lord into the *Great Mysterious Capital* and inquired after the *True Unity of the Dao*.

Next they ascended to the **Eighth Heaven**, where they met the *Heavenly Emperor of Meditative Goodness*, who drove a chariot of *Flying Clouds of Verdant Mist*, shaded by a canopy of *Eightfold Jade Radiance*, bearing the *Ninefold Banner of Penetrating Spirit*. His retinue included seventy thousand immortal lads and jade maidens. He welcomed the Old Lord into the *Pearl Forest and Jade Garden* and inquired after the *Imperial Unity of the Dao*.

Next they ascended to the **Ninth Heaven**, where they met the *Heavenly Emperor of Yushan*, who rode a chariot of *Flourishing Azure Mist and Flowing Clouds*, shaded by a canopy of *Ninefold Radiant Treasure Light*, bearing the *Flying Dragon Banner for Communing with Spirits*. His retinue included ninety thousand immortal lads and jade maidens. He welcomed the Old Lord into the *Mysterious Terrace and Purple Chamber* and inquired after the *Subtle and Imperceptible Dao*.

In every celestial palace they visited, tables were set with *jade blossoms and jade fruits*, *moon nectar and cloud wine*, *emerald liqueur and flowing incense*, *eightfold orchid delicacies*, and *mystical fungi and wondrous fruits*, their radiance illuminating the banquet seats. At that time, celestial music resounded in grand assembly, and divine chants reached sublime perfection—beyond all description.

The perfected immortals and heavenly emperors they encountered all bore *circular luminosity upon their necks*. Each bowed to the Old Lord and inquired after the *subtle Dao*. Their discussions often concerned the rise and fall of heaven and earth, the lengthening and shortening of kalpas, the good and evil of karmic deeds, past and future lives, the principles of karmic retribution, and the origins of the Great Dao.

The *Flowing Sands* transformed eighty-one kingdoms and ninety-six kinds of heterodox teachings. The Old Master established the teachings of *purity, stillness, non-action, and humble emptiness* in the Central Lands, and later journeyed westward into the *Flowing Sands*. Among the barbarian peoples, who relied on the swiftness of dogs and horses and indulged in their love of killing, he did not shrink from their fierce and divergent desires, nor from the perilous and distant roads. He arrived among them with humility and transformed them with compassion, hoping they might turn from evil and incline toward goodness—thus, he made no distinctions.

As the saying of Confucius goes: *"In teaching, there are no distinctions."*

At that time, the Old Lord’s transformative work reached the kingdom of Yutian. He emitted a *nine-colored divine radiance*, which illuminated the dusty and sandy lands of the western regions, its light reaching everywhere without regard to distance. In an instant, within the city of Pimo, palaces were spontaneously adorned with gold and treasures, and a great Dharma seat was established upon the earth. The surroundings were resplendent with splendor, and the sages and perfected ones of the Three Realms, along with all the dragon spirits, arrived riding clouds and cranes.

The king of Yutian and the various Hu kings—eighty-one kingdoms in all—beheld this wondrous and rare spectacle of light. Day and night, they gazed in awe, filled with reverence and praise. The Most High, through his wondrous spiritual power, gathered and received them all. In a single thought, those kings assembled before the Dao.

The Old Lord then ascended the jeweled seat, his countenance majestic and dignified. Incense was burned, flowers scattered, and the music of the *Celestial Harmony* played. At that time, the king of Yutian and the rulers who had come—Zhujuban, Kebantao, Humiduo, the Great Yuezhi, Gudutao, Jumiluo, Jiesu, Zhihanna, Jiuyudejian, Yida, Wulage, Shifanyan, Hushijian, Duolejian, Chubin, Hedaluozhi, Persia, Shule, Suiye, Qiuci, Fulin, Dashi, Zhifu, Shuman, Danmo, Juyue, Cuogu, Tanling, Gaochang, Yanqi, Gongyue, Seni, Wangkang, Shi, Mi, Simopan, Cao, He, the Great and Lesser An, Mu, Wunage, Xunwu, Huoxun, the Western Women, Daqin, Shewei, Poluonai, Dinahu, Jiamolu, Qiantuoluo, Wuchang, Jieshemi, Jialuo, Buluoluo, Niboluo, Recha, Shizi, Jushinajieluo, Pisheli, Jiebita, Shiluofa, Zhanboluo, Sanmazuzha, Wucha, Sulacha, Xindu, Wulashi, Huli, Goutou, Jiali, Mantuman, Niba, Yuediyan, Shemi, the Lesser People, Xuanqu, Taoluoyiluo, Langjieluo, Shi, the Twenty-One Kings of the Five Indias—more than eighty kings in all—along with their queens and consorts and all their retinues, surrounded and gazed from afar, eager to hear the sound of the Dharma.

The Lord Lao addressed the various Hu kings: "You indulge in the five poisons of the heart and crave only blood and flesh. Your slaughter knows no satiety, and you sever the lives of countless beings. I shall now expound for you the *Futu Sutra*. As for *Futu*, it is the Dao of the Buddha. To explain it to you: *Fu* means that all the myriad existences are not real, and *Tu* means you must no longer cut down or harm living beings. Those who cannot uphold this precept may eat only the flesh of creatures that have died of themselves. Yet your hair is unkempt and your fists clenched, your bodies reek of rank odors, and even your felt and furs are thick with filth and grime. You must shave your hair, cleanse your bodies and minds, and constantly cultivate compassion to extinguish afflictions. Follow the fasting days and precepts I have established, always observing the fast and upholding the precepts, cutting off all perverse thoughts, and taking refuge in the Great Dao.

Those whom I now transform through my teaching are my foremost disciple, the Supreme Perfected Yin Xi, who shall be your master. His body is golden in hue, adorned with all the marks of excellence, and he expounds the *Futu* with skillful means. His face is always turned toward the west, signifying that he does not forget his origin. Because I have bound myself to this path, I manifest in this form, so that all who see him may awaken the heart of compassion."

You, kings and lords, must pay homage and make offerings without retreat, thereby attaining fruition on your own. Moreover, there are ninety-six schools of heterodox teachings, all of which I shall transform, guiding them into the Orthodox Dao.

The ninety-six schools are as follows: the Yu Zhe Luo heterodoxy, the Cha Fa Zhi Nan Fu heterodoxy, the Bao Xing heterodoxy, the Re Hui Shen heterodoxy, the Shao Zi Qian heterodoxy, the Bin Tou Lu heterodoxy, the Zhe Hu Shen heterodoxy, the Dao Jian heterodoxy, the Xin Xing heterodoxy, the Bian Jian heterodoxy, the Jian Dao heterodoxy, the Kong Jian heterodoxy, the Xu Kong heterodoxy, the Bu Zhe Hu heterodoxy, the Shou Luo heterodoxy, the Kong Luan Yin heterodoxy, the Fan Bo She heterodoxy, the Hong Zhao heterodoxy, the Pu An heterodoxy, the Zhang Shi heterodoxy, the Wu Xiang heterodoxy, the Zhen Di heterodoxy, the Fan Yin heterodoxy, the Zong Ming heterodoxy, the Da Ba heterodoxy, the Guang Xue heterodoxy, the Qing Xiu heterodoxy, the Jiang Lun heterodoxy, the Xian Ji heterodoxy, the A Xiu Luo heterodoxy, the She Yi Shi Zi Wang heterodoxy, the Shen Qi Jia Nü heterodoxy, the Hui Yi heterodoxy, the Jiu Mo Ye Na heterodoxy, the Fan Mo Ge Luo heterodoxy, the Gang Qi Sui Luo heterodoxy, the Na Luo Yan heterodoxy, the Qian Tan heterodoxy, the Qiu Ba Mo heterodoxy, the Dan Mo heterodoxy, the Mo Yun Shou Luo heterodoxy, the Ba Zhe Luo Ke heterodoxy, the Ba Ge Luo heterodoxy, the Zhe Wen Tu heterodoxy, the Ni Lan heterodoxy, the Shang Jie Luo heterodoxy, the Yang Ju Shi heterodoxy, the Mo Li Zhi heterodoxy, the A Zha Bo Ju heterodoxy, the Shi He heterodoxy, the Mo Di heterodoxy, the Na Ju Ba Luo heterodoxy, the Zhao Shen Gui heterodoxy, the Bo Jian Ti heterodoxy, the Jiu Liu Jia Ge heterodoxy, the Guang Zhao heterodoxy, the Wei Yan heterodoxy, the Hong Guang heterodoxy, the Hui Xiang heterodoxy, the Pi Tan Xiu Duo Luo heterodoxy, the Zhen Wei heterodoxy, the Dai Yang Zi heterodoxy, the Zi Zai Guang Bo Yan Zheng heterodoxy, the Ji Ye Dao heterodoxy, the Qiu Na Ba Na heterodoxy, the Yi Zhen heterodoxy, the De Shuang heterodoxy, the Ming Lian heterodoxy, the Ge Huai Yi heterodoxy, the Ni Li heterodoxy, the Gao Wang Ti heterodoxy, the A Qiu Na heterodoxy, the Teng Kong Dao Wei heterodoxy, the Fo Sha Mo Sha heterodoxy, the Na Jian Tao heterodoxy, the Po Mo Zhi Na heterodoxy, the Ni Lian Ni heterodoxy, the Po Li Po heterodoxy, the Dao Li Dao heterodoxy, the A Shan Qi Di heterodoxy, the Kong Jie Da Dao heterodoxy, the Tuo Shen heterodoxy, the Dao Jian heterodoxy, the Dao Xing heterodoxy, the Fan Yi heterodoxy, the Da Feng heterodoxy, the Chao Kong heterodoxy, the Shan Nü Tian heterodoxy, the Yuan Tong Tai Xu heterodoxy, the Wo Jiao heterodoxy, the Kuang Xian heterodoxy, the Deng Fen Hua heterodoxy, the A Luo Luo Zha heterodoxy, the A Lü Zhi heterodoxy, the Zhao Yi Ming Wu Qu heterodoxy, and the Yin A Qi Tao Li heterodoxy.

These ninety-six heterodox schools, whether male or female, human or non-human, are capable of demonic deeds. They shave their hair, don black robes, and bind their feet, expounding various samadhis, various contemplative methods, and doctrines of equality and inequality. They perform all manner of transformations and illusions, assuming various forms to lead people into deviant paths without respite.

The Venerable Lord said to Perfected Yin and the other disciples: "After my departure, these heterodox teachings will spread throughout the world, even into the lands of Shu and Xia. Their practices will remain as before, but they will become even more covetous of people’s wealth and offerings, akin to licentiousness, causing people to forsake their lives, property, and even their sons and daughters, claiming that such acts will yield karmic rewards in the past and future. They will also delude kings and emperors, leading them to abandon governance and turn away from purity and stillness. Those who cling to these heterodox teachings will grow arrogant, deceiving and confusing the Great Dao with myriad falsehoods. You must employ the *Futu* to transform them, guiding them into the Dharma-gate of non-duality and severing their deviant obstacles. Thereafter, all heterodox practitioners will come, bowing their heads and earnestly seeking true instruction, no longer serving as demonic protectors. The origins and endings of these matters are recorded in the scriptures and traditions, but the texts are too extensive to transcribe here."

Confucius Inquires About Ritual
Confucius said: "Those born with knowledge are the highest; those who learn and thereby know are next. Yet if there exists a nature endowed with innate knowledge, who but the sage is fit to possess it?" Lao Dan and Confucius were alike in sagacity. However, Confucius’ way of engaging the world left nothing unexhausted, yet when it came to transcending names and numbers, soaring beyond the marvel of solitary insight, he sought only to harmonize with the Dao. Thus, from Lu he journeyed to Zhou, where upon meeting Lao Dan, he withdrew, sighing, "Like a dragon!" This is how the sage exalted the Dao, and herein lies the boundary of transmission and the inception of teaching—nothing greater than this. Yet worldly scholars, who dabble and plagiarize to inflate their own worth, are they not deluded?

The *Kongzi Jiayu* states: Confucius said to Nan Gong Jing Shu, "I have heard that Lao Dan is profoundly versed in antiquity and the present, penetrating the origins of ritual and music, and illuminating the return of virtue and the Dao. He is my teacher. Now I shall go to him." Jing Shu replied, "I humbly receive your command." He then addressed the Lord of Lu, saying, "Your servant has received the command of my late father: 'Confucius is a descendant of sages. Though his lineage was extinguished in Song, his ancestor Fu Fu He once held a state. He served Dukes Li, and later Zheng Kao Fu, assisting three rulers—Dai, Wu, and Xuan—growing ever more reverent. Thus, the inscription on his tripod reads: "At the first command, I bent; at the second, I crouched; at the third, I stooped. I walked along the wall, and none dared insult me. I cooked in this, I boiled in this, to feed my mouth." Such was his reverence and frugality. Zang Sun He said: 'The descendants of sages, if not ruling in their own time, will surely produce one who is enlightened and accomplished.' Confucius, from his youth, loved ritual. He is the one."

He charged his servant, saying, "You must take him as your teacher."

Now Confucius was about to journey to Zhou to observe the legacy of the former kings, to examine the ultimate principles of ritual and music, and to pursue the great enterprise. The Lord of Lu, why not provide him with a carriage and resources, and request that he be allowed to go?" The Lord said, "Very well." He gave Confucius one carriage, two horses, and a young attendant and steward, Jing Shu, to accompany him to Zhou. There, Confucius inquired about ritual from Lao Dan, sought music from Chang Hong, traversed the sites of suburban and ancestral sacrifices, studied the design of the Bright Hall, and examined the measurements of ancestral temples and court assemblies. Thereupon, he sighed deeply and said, "Only now do I truly know the sageliness of the Duke of Zhou and the reason Zhou became king."

When he was about to leave Zhou, Laozi saw him off, saying, "I have heard that the wealthy and noble send people off with material gifts, while the benevolent send them off with words. Though I cannot claim wealth or nobility, I have presumptuously taken the name of a benevolent man. Allow me to send you off with words. Generally, among the scholars of today, those who are keenly perceptive and deeply insightful yet near death are those who delight in criticizing others. Those who are broadly learned, eloquent, and far-reaching yet endanger themselves are those who take pleasure in exposing others' faults. As a son, do not bring trouble upon yourself; as a minister, do not bring harm upon yourself."

Confucius said, "I respectfully receive your teaching."

Upon returning from Zhou to Lu, his reputation grew ever more esteemed. Disciples came to him from distant lands, numbering some three thousand.

*Records of the Historian* states: Confucius inquired about ritual from Laozi. Laozi said, "The people you speak of—their bodies and bones have long since decayed; only their words remain. When a noble person encounters the right time, he mounts his carriage; when he does not, he drifts like tumbleweed. I have heard that a good merchant hides his wealth as if empty, and a noble person of great virtue appears simple-minded. Rid yourself of your arrogance, excess desires, affected demeanor, and extravagant ambitions—none of these benefit you. What I have told you is all there is to it."

Confucius departed and said to his disciples, "Birds—I know they can fly; fish—I know they can swim; beasts—I know they can run. Those that run can be caught in nets, those that swim can be hooked with lines, and those that fly can be brought down with arrows. But as for the dragon, I cannot know how it rides the wind and clouds to ascend the heavens. Today, I have seen Laozi—is he not like a dragon?"

*The True Classic of Southern Florescence* states: Confucius went west to deposit books in the Zhou archives. Zilu advised, "I have heard that the Keeper of Archives in Zhou, Lao Dan, has resigned and returned home. If you wish to deposit books, perhaps you could go through him." Confucius said, "Very well." He went to see Lao Dan, but Lao Dan refused. Thereupon, Confucius expounded the Twelve Classics to persuade him. Lao Dan interrupted, saying, "This is too verbose. I wish to hear the essentials." Confucius said, "The essentials lie in benevolence and righteousness." Lao Dan again said, "This is too verbose. I wish to hear the essentials." Confucius replied, "The essentials lie in benevolence and righteousness."

Lao Dan asked, "I ask whether benevolence and righteousness are part of human nature." Confucius said, "Indeed. Without benevolence, a noble person cannot be accomplished; without righteousness, he cannot live. Benevolence and righteousness are the true nature of humanity. What more is there to say?"

Lao Dan said, "I ask what benevolence and righteousness are." Confucius said, "Joy in the center, universal love without partiality—these are the sentiments of benevolence and righteousness."

Lao Dan said, "Hmm, these words come close to being misguided. Is not universal love impractical? To be without partiality is itself a form of partiality. If you wish to ensure that the world does not lose its shepherds, then know that heaven and earth already have their constancy, the sun and moon already have their brightness, the stars and constellations already have their order, birds and beasts already have their flocks, and plants and trees already have their places. You should simply follow virtue and act, follow the Dao and proceed—you have already arrived. Why then do you clamor about benevolence and righteousness as if beating a drum to seek a lost child? Alas, you confuse human nature!"

Confucius asked Lao Dan, "Suppose someone governs the Dao by emulating others, judging what is permissible or not, what is so or not. A debater once said, 'Separate hardness and whiteness as if they were suspended and distant.' Could such a person be called a sage?"

Lao Dan said, "This is like a petty official burdened by tasks, exhausting his body and straining his mind. A dog trained to catch raccoons becomes anxious, and a monkey brought from the mountains is restless. Qiu, I tell you what you cannot hear and what you cannot speak of. There are many with heads and feet but no heart or ears, and those with form and those without form or shape—all exist without exception. Their movement is stillness, their life is death, and their decline is rise. This is not their true nature. When governance lies with people, they forget things and forget heaven—this is called forgetting oneself. Those who forget themselves are said to enter into heaven."

At the age of fifty-one, Confucius had still not heard the Dao. He traveled south to Pei and met Lao Dan. Lao Dan said, "Have you come? I have heard that you are a worthy man from the north. Have you attained the Dao?"

Confucius said, "I have not."

Lao Dan said, "How have you sought it?"

Confucius said, "I sought it in regulations and calculations, but after five years, I had not attained it."

Lao Dan said, "How else have you sought it?"

Confucius said, "I sought it in yin and yang, but after twelve years, I had not attained it."

Lao Dan said, "Indeed. If the Dao could be offered, people would offer it to their rulers. If it could be presented, people would present it to their parents. If it could be told to others, people would tell it to their brothers. If it could be given to others, people would give it to their descendants. Yet it cannot—there is no other reason: internally, there is no master to hold it, and externally, there is no standard to guide it. What comes from within is not received from without—thus, the sage does not emerge. What enters from without has no master within—thus, the sage does not conceal it."

Confucius visited Lao Dan and spoke of benevolence and righteousness. Lao Dan said, "When chaff gets into your eyes, the heavens and earth and the four directions seem to shift places. When mosquitoes and gnats bite your skin, you cannot sleep all night. Now, benevolence and righteousness assail my heart like this—there is no greater disorder. You, sir, would have the world not lose its simplicity. You, too, should follow the wind and move, embodying virtue and standing firm. Why then do you act so strenuously, like one carrying a great drum searching for a lost child?

The swan does not bathe daily to remain white, nor does the crow blacken itself daily to stay black. The natural simplicity of black and white is not worth debating; the spectacle of fame and reputation is not worth expanding. When a spring dries up, fish find themselves stranded on land, moistening one another with dampness, wetting one another with foam—yet this is not as good as forgetting one another in rivers and lakes."

After seeing Lao Dan, Confucius returned home and did not speak for three days. His disciples asked, "Master, when you saw Lao Dan, what advice did you seek to give him?"

Confucius said, "Only now have I truly seen the dragon. The dragon coalesces into form, scatters into patterns, rides the clouds and qi, and nourishes itself with yin and yang. My mouth gaped open, yet I could not utter a word—what advice could I possibly give Lao Dan?"

Zigong said, "Then is it true that a person can dwell like a corpse yet manifest like a dragon, roar like thunder yet remain as silent as an abyss, and act with the power of heaven and earth? May I, too, observe such a one?" He then arranged for Confucius to meet Lao Dan again.

Lao Dan was sitting in his hall when he responded softly, "My years have advanced and passed away—what would you warn me of?"

Zigong said, "The governance of the Three Kings and Five Emperors differed, yet their reputations were equally esteemed. Why then do you alone consider them not sages?"

Lao Dan said, "Young man, come closer. Why do you say their governance differed?"

Zigong replied, "Yao passed the throne to Shun, Shun to Yu, Yu relied on labor while Tang used force, King Wen submitted to Zhou without daring to oppose, and King Wu opposed Zhou without consenting—thus, I say they differed."

Lao Dan said, "Young man, come closer, and I will tell you of the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. The Yellow Emperor governed the world by unifying the people’s hearts—when people did not weep for their deceased parents, none found fault in this. Yao governed by fostering kinship—when people killed for their kin, none found fault in this. Shun governed by inciting competition—pregnant women gave birth in ten months, children spoke at five months, and before they could even crawl, they began to recognize others, and thus people began to die young. Yu governed by altering the people’s hearts—people had intentions, and warfare followed; killing bandits was not considered killing, and people formed their own factions, dividing the world. Thus, the world was greatly alarmed, and the schools of Ru and Mo arose. Their beginnings had order, yet now, what can be said of women? I tell you, the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors was called ‘order,’ yet no disorder was greater.

The wisdom of the Three Sovereigns obscured the brightness of the sun and moon above, disrupted the essence of mountains and rivers below, and threw the workings of the four seasons into chaos. Their knowledge surpassed even the tail of the *lidu* beast, yet creatures could not secure the tranquility of their natures. And they still called themselves sages—is this not shameful? Truly, they knew no shame."

Zigong stood uneasily, shifting his feet.

Confucius said to Lao Dan, "I have studied the Six Classics—*The Book of Songs*, *The Book of Documents*, *The Rites*, *The Music*, *The Changes*, and *The Spring and Autumn Annals*—for a long time, believing I understood their essence. Yet I have advised seventy-two rulers, expounding the Way of the former kings and clarifying the governance of the Zhou and Shao, yet not a single ruler has put them into practice. How difficult it is to persuade people, and how hard it is to make the Dao clear!"

Lao Dan said, "Fortunate indeed that you have not encountered a ruler of a well-ordered age. The Six Classics are but the worn-out traces of the former kings—how could they be the essence of those traces? What you speak of is but the near. Traces are what shoes produce, yet are the near traces themselves shoes?

When white egrets gaze at one another, their pupils do not move, yet they mate by the wind. Insects, when the male calls from the upwind and the female responds from downwind, mate by the wind. Each species has its own male and female, thus they mate by the wind. Nature cannot be altered, fate cannot be changed, time cannot be halted, and the Dao cannot be blocked. If one attains the Dao, there is nothing one cannot do. If one loses it, there is nothing one can do."

Three months later, Confucius visited again and said, "I have attained it! Crows and magpies nurture their young, fish pass foam to one another, the slender-waisted wasp transforms, and the elder brother weeps for his younger brother. How long it has been! I have not been transformed by becoming human. If I am not transformed by becoming human, how can I transform others?"

Lao Dan said, "Good. You have attained it."

*The Book of Master Lie* states: The Grand Steward of Shang met Confucius and said, "Qiu, are you a sage?"

Confucius replied, "How would I dare claim to be a sage? Yet I am one who has broadly studied and retains much knowledge."

The Grand Steward said, "Were the Three Kings sages?"

Confucius said, "The Three Kings were skilled in employing wisdom and courage—whether they were sages, I do not know."

He asked, "Were the Five Emperors sages?"

Confucius said, "They were skilled in employing benevolence and righteousness—whether they were sages, I do not know."

He asked, "Were the Three Sovereigns sages?"

Confucius said, "They were skilled in adapting to the times—whether they were sages, I do not know."

The Grand Steward was greatly alarmed and said, "Then who is a sage?"

Confucius changed his expression and replied, "Among the people of the Western Regions, there is a sage who governs without disorder, is trusted without speaking, transforms without teaching, and is so vast that the people cannot name him. This is what is called a sage—Lao Dan is such a one."

He is known as the Old Master by the River. The sage’s spiritual transformations are near, sometimes appearing, sometimes withdrawing—thus, he has no constancy.

Tradition holds that the Old Master by the River was the transformation of the Most High, though none can confirm whether this is so.

Upon examining the records in detail, though Confucius refrained from speaking of prodigies, supernatural forces, disorder, or spirits, such matters—so long as they do not descend into the bizarre or monstrous—pose no harm to governance or moral instruction.

Tradition holds that Emperor Wen of Han and Empress Dowager Dou favored the arts of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, compelling the realm as though none could hold office without mastering the *Laozi*. When the Emperor read the *Five Thousand Characters* and found passages unclear, the Primordial One manifested in bodily form, appearing as the Old Master by the River. Dwelling by the banks of the Yellow River in Shaan, he constantly recited the *Scriptures of Dao and Virtue*. The Emperor dispatched envoys to inquire into their meaning, but the Master replied: "The Dao is revered, virtue is noble—these cannot be questioned from afar." The Emperor then ordered his carriage prepared to visit him.

The Master crouched within his hut, refusing to rise. The Emperor addressed him: "Under all heaven, there is no land that is not the king’s; among all who dwell within the realm, there is none who is not the king’s subject. Though you possess the Dao, you remain my subject—why not humble yourself? With but a moment’s command, I can make men rich or poor, noble or base." The Master clapped his hands, leapt, and slowly ascended into the void, rising several yards above the earth before halting in the empty sky. Gazing down, he replied: "I ascend not to heaven, am not burdened by men, nor do I dwell upon the earth—what subject am I to you? How could Your Majesty make me rich or poor, noble or base?" The Emperor, awakened, recognized him as a divine being and descended from his carriage to bow in reverence and apology. Thereupon, the Master imparted to him the profound and subtle principles of the upper and lower chapters.

To this day, a temple stands at the site where the Old Master by the River once dwelled, north of Shanzhou, alongside Emperor Wen’s Terrace for Gazing at Immortals.

During the reign of Emperor Wu, who favored the Way of immortals, the Most High dispatched the Nine Heavens Attendant Dongfang Shuo to assist him. Later, the Queen Mother of the West and the Lady of the Upper Prime bestowed upon the Emperor five silver statues, saying: "These are the images of the Most High Lord Lao." They also presented the *Scripture of Supreme Purity*, the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*, and other texts, which the Emperor received with reverence.

After Emperor Wu performed the Feng sacrifice on Mount Song, he heard three cries of "Long live the Emperor!" and thus converted his traveling palace into the Abbey of Ten Thousand Years. Over thirty additional lodges were established, all dedicated to Daoist rites. Each abbey housed seven Daoist priests, following the precedent of King Mu of Zhou’s former abbeys.

In the eighth year of the *Yanxi* era, Emperor Huan dreamed of the Most High descending to his court. He then ordered the renovation of the shrine by the Wo River, and the stele composed by Bian Shao still stands today.

**The Transmission of the *Scripture of Great Peace* to Gan Ji**
The Grand Chancellor Su once remarked to Pengqiuzi: "To compose writings without drawing upon past precedents is a challenge few can meet." Upon reading the *Scripture of Great Peace*, I observed its intent and diction—though it never borrows from the words of former sages, it forms a style entirely its own. This is its difficulty.

This scripture is said to have been composed by Gan Ji, or perhaps obtained from the waters. According to internal traditions, in the *Heping* era of Emperor Cheng, the Primordial One divided his body and descended to the Quyang Spring in Langye Commandery, where he bestowed upon the man of Beihai, Gan Ji, the *Scripture of Great Peace* in one hundred seventy scrolls. Its essential teaching states: "When a person is born, Heaven endows them with spirit, Earth with essence, and the Center with the Black. If one can preserve essence, cherish spirit, and guard the Black, within they attain longevity; without, they bring great peace to the state."

In the second year of the *Yuanhe* era of Emperor Zhang, the Most High again visited Langye, bestowing upon Gan Ji one hundred eighty precepts to aid the libationers in preserving the body and cultivating perfection. He told Gan Ji: "The ancient sages and worthies all attained the Dao through these precepts. The Dao itself has no precepts—it is through the master that one achieves completion. The Dao cannot be abandoned, nor can the master be slighted." Gan Ji bowed in reverence and accepted the command.

By the time of Emperor Shun, the man of Langye, Gong Chong, presented the *Scripture of Great Peace* at court, stating in his memorial that he had received it directly from Gan Ji, who in turn had received it from the Most High.

Beyond the main scripture, there exists an additional scroll titled *Repeated Texts*, attributed to the Later Sage Lord, comprising two thousand one hundred twenty-three characters. Though resembling seal script, it is not, and its preface is obscure and difficult to comprehend. There is also the *Digest of Great Peace* in ten scrolls, unattributed, which broadly elucidates the chapters of the original scripture. Another text, the *Secret Essentials of Great Peace* in one scroll, claims to have been received by the Minister of the Upper Prime, the Azure Lad, and discusses the method of guarding the One. Additionally, there is the *Biographies of the Patriarchs* in one scroll, unattributed, which records the lives of the Lord of Xicheng, Bo He, and Gan Ji, compiled into a single volume.

In the late Tang dynasty, there lived a man named Wenqiu Fangyuan from Susong, well-versed in the classics and history, and possessed of keen discernment. He once studied under Xianglin Zuo Yuanzhe. One day, Zuo said to him: "Have you not heard the words of the Old Master: 'My greatest affliction is that I have a body'? The body arises from non-action and gives rise to action—now, returning to the root is called non-action. Non-action does not mean clinging to emptiness, nor does it mean becoming obstructed by existence. To grasp either existence or non-existence is to become stagnant. Only by unifying existence and non-existence, dissolving all thought, can one approach the Dao.

The Buddhists call this the Chan School; Confucius called it 'sitting in forgetfulness.' The *Book of Changes* says: 'Without thought, without action, still and unmoving, yet responsive to all things under heaven—its return is one and the same.' The scriptures say: 'When you seek to meet it, you do not see its head; when you follow it, you do not see its rear.' What is this thing? If you silently comprehend and spiritually realize it, what more is there to seek? If one does not awaken in this life, they will drift through endless kalpas in confusion. If one attains it, what difference remains between delusion and enlightenment? Why seek it in the depths of empty mountains, beneath towering pines?

What I regret is that your talent and capacity are so lofty—they could serve as a beacon for the gate of truth." Fangyuan bowed in gratitude and departed.

He often admired the character of Ge Zhichuan and Tao Hongjing. Beyond consuming the Black and refining the body, he was particularly devoted to the *Scripture of Great Peace*, which he annotated into thirty chapters, distilling its essential principles.

**Volume Four of the *Records of the Dragon’s Likeness* Concludes**
**Volume Five of the *Records of the Dragon’s Likeness***

Compiled by **Chongde Wuzhen**, Great Master of Awakened Virtue, Left-Street Supervisor of the Abandoned Scriptures and Teachings, and Joint Director of the Daoist Clergy—**Jia Shansiang**

The **Celestial Master of Han** received the **Cloud Scripts**, which were devised to designate the hidden names of the **Heavenly Worthies**, the **Dao Realms**, the **Immortal Palaces**, the **sun**, the **moon**, and the **constellations**—serving as their esoteric appellations. Thus, the sages elucidated them: in their lesser form, as **spirit talismans**, and in their greater form, as **true registers**, to be presented to the **Three Realms** and the **ghosts and spirits of the unseen**, all of whom bow in reverence, just as the Son of Heaven’s imperial seal is displayed to the realm.

When **Yu the Great** tamed the floods, he first obtained the *Five Numinous Talismans of the Sacred Treasure*. Later, the **Most High** transmitted to the **Celestial Master** a total of **twenty-four ranks**. The **scriptures, charts, and registers of the Shangqing methods** subsequently descended to the world. Considering the **Celestial Master’s** merits in using **talismans and registers** to heal illnesses, dispel demonic perversities, and succor beings, their transmission to posterity has been no small boon. The **scriptural fasts and rites** were also conferred upon him, from which the **protocols for invoking blessings and expiating transgressions** originated.

According to the preface of the *Scripture of the Southern Dipper*: The **Most High** descended to **Linzhou in Shu**, journeyed to **Dayi**, and arrived at **Mount Heming**, where he first bestowed upon the **Celestial Master** the *Secret Register of the Orthodox Unity Alliance and Might* in **twenty-four ranked divisions**, along with the **methods for worshipping the sun and moon**, the **High Ascension and Radiant Convergence techniques**, the **rites for the Three Primes and Eight Nodal Days**, the **texts for expiating sins**, **erasing the Black Registers**, and **delivering the Seven Ancestors**—these constitute the **Three Registers Fasts**.

The **Celestial Master** had earlier obtained the *Yellow Emperor’s Nine-Cauldron Elixir Scripture* at **Mount Song**. Later, while dwelling in reclusion at **Mount Heming**, he prepared the ingredients and refined the elixir according to the method. After three years, the **cinnabar** was complete, but he dared not consume it. He said to his disciple **Wang Chang**: "The **divine elixir** is now perfected. If I take it, I shall ascend to become a **Perfected**. Yet without great merit, I should first eliminate harm and promote benefit for the state, aiding the people. Only then, having first labored diligently, may I consume the elixir and ascend lightly, serving the **Three Borders** without shame."

Thereupon, the **Most High** personally descended in a **ritual chariot** and conferred the **true scriptures**. After cultivating for a thousand days, the **Celestial Master** suddenly gained the ability to **inwardly inspect his five viscera** and **externally gather the myriad spirits**. The **Most High** then dispatched the **Jade Maiden of Pure Harmony** to teach him the **qi of exhalation and inhalation**, the **Three Steps and Nine Traces**, the **treading of Qian and the Dipper**, the **summoning of the Nine Origins**, the **alignment of the Seven Governors**, and the **capture of demonic perversities** according to the terrain’s indications. Only then did he consume the elixir, and his **Dao and methods** grew ever more potent.

He waged war against the **ghostly demons of the Six Heavens**, seizing **twenty-four governances** and transforming them into **blessed precincts**, naming them **realms of transformation**. He demoted their chieftains to **yin officials** and selected Daoists to conduct the **burning and cultivation rites**. Thus, the **offices of the unseen and the manifest** were distinguished, and the **paths of humans and ghosts** diverged.

Later, in **Renshou County**, he subdued the **Twelve Heavenly Wandering Jade Maidens**, who transformed the earth into a **brine spring**. Boiling it for ablutions, he named the place **Long Prefecture**. On the **third occasion**, the **Most High** descended again, bestowing a **thousand scrolls of scriptures**, all essential principles of cultivation, to be transmitted to those of the **Dao**, enabling them to **receive deliverance in the flesh** and **abide eternally through kalpas**.

Thereupon, he traveled with the **Celestial Master** to **Chengdu**. The **Most High** rode a **dragon chariot**, while the **Celestial Master** mounted a **white crane**. Suddenly, **five-colored clouds** descended, arriving at the site where the **Jade Maiden of Fuxi** had refined the **Great Elixir**. The **earth spirits** were moved, and a **jade platform** surged forth, rising over a **zhang** in height. The **Most High** ascended the platform, and the **Celestial Master** bowed before him, whereupon he expounded the *Scripture of the Seven Origins of the Northern Dipper*, the method for **erasing death and prolonging life**. This occurred in the **first year of Yongshou of Emperor Huan of Han**, the **year yiwei**, on the **seventh day of the first month**.

On the **Upper Prime** of that year, the **Venerable Lord** again taught the **Celestial Master** the *Marvelous Scripture of the Six Offices of the Southern Dipper for Prolonging Life and Delivering Beings*. Thereafter, the **Venerable Lord** said to the **Celestial Master**: "I shall command my chariot to journey with you to the **Seven-Treasure Terrace of the Golden Pond at Banfeng on Kunlun**, where we shall pay homage to the **Most High**." Suddenly, all the **Heavenly Perfected** arrived through the void, each riding **golden chariots** and **jeweled canopies**, a **thousand chariots and ten thousand riders**, assembling on the terrace for **three days and nights**. The **celestial music of the Grand Harmony** resounded, and joy was boundless.

The **Lord of the Dao** addressed the **Celestial Master**: "Since the **Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors**, there have been the **cycles of ninety-six calamities**, when the heavens collapsed and the earth split. From the end of the **Three Dynasties** to the era of the **Five Hegemons**, rulers and ministers violated **virtue**, the four borders were lawless, the **true numina** concealed their radiance, customs darkened, and perversities spread. **Demonic doctrines and ghostly utterances** arose, calling themselves the **Six Heavens**, slaughtering beings and disturbing the realm. The ignorant people all followed them, and there emerged **shamans singing and dancing**, falsely invoking spirits to deceive the good. Now I bestow upon you the **true statutes** to **eradicate the Six Heavens’ perversities**, purify the realm, and name them the *Statutes of the Great Perfection*."

He further commanded the **Youthful Lad of Azure** and others: "I entrust you with the **seals and sashes**, enabling you to uphold the **twelve hundred official protocols**, along with the **talismans, registers, contracts, commands, scriptures, precepts, and laws**, to **assist the state and sustain destiny**, **nurture life and restrain evil**, and perform **meritorious deeds**, guiding all to enter the **Dao** and unite with the **true and authentic**."

"However, the **Qiang**, **Hu**, **Di**, and **Yi** of the four directions are encroaching upon the Central Kingdom, and the Chinese people will dwindle. To dispel this disaster and repel this harm, the state should establish a **cultivation hall** at **Yushan north of Luoyang** to practice the **Dao and invoke blessings**, ensuring the nation’s peace and the people’s well-being. Otherwise, poison may flow through the Central Kingdom, which is not the intent of **cherishing life**."

After receiving his charge, the **Celestial Master** bowed in gratitude and withdrew. The **Venerable Lord** then entrusted **Ling** with the **twenty-four transformations corresponding to the twenty-four perversities**, and added four more transformation names, totaling **twenty-eight transformations** to correspond to the **twenty-eight constellations**. He also established **thirty-six quiet huts**, divided the **talismans for covenants**, and fully transmitted the **Orthodox Unity** teachings.

The **Venerable Lord** further bestowed upon the **Celestial Master** the **great methods of the six annual fasts and ten monthly fasts**, all drawn from the *Five Chapters Scripture of the Sacred Treasure*, naturally written in **celestial script** as the *Essential Marvelous Scripture* in one scroll, to be proclaimed throughout the realm.

The essentials state: The **six annual fasts** occur in the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months. During these times, the **Three Heavens** command the **Celestial Thearch Taiyi** and the envoys of the **Three Officials** to inspect the sins and blessings of all people under heaven. Those who cultivate these six great fasts shall have ten sufferings removed, escape calamitous encounters, and through worship of the **Most High**, attain longevity.

The **ten monthly fasts** are as follows: on the first day of the month, beneath the **Northern Dipper**; on the eighth day, beneath the **Northern Dipper’s Execution Office**; on the fourteenth day, when the **Taiyi** envoy descends; on the fifteenth day, when the **Celestial Thearch** and the **Three Officials** all descend; on the eighteenth day, when the **Celestial Thearch** descends; on the twenty-third day, when the **Taiyi’s Eight Divine Envoys** descend; on the twenty-fourth day, beneath the **North Star**; on the twenty-eighth day, when the **Lower Taiyi** descends; on the twenty-ninth day, when the **Middle Taiyi** descends; and on the thirtieth day, when the **Upper Taiyi** descends. On the days when the **Lower, Middle, and Upper Taiyi** descend, they reach even the **earth and waters**, and all revered deities descend to traverse the celestial realms, examining good and evil.

Additionally, on **jiazi** days, **Taiyi** reviews the spirits and deities; on **gengshen** days, the **Three Corpses** report human transgressions; and on one’s **natal day**, merits and conduct are tallied. Furthermore, on the **eight seasonal nodes**, eight spirits record human good and evil.

There are also the **three Yuan fast days**: the fifteenth day of the first month (**Upper Yuan**), the fifteenth day of the seventh month (**Middle Yuan**), and the fifteenth day of the tenth month (**Lower Yuan**). On these three Yuan days, the **Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water** assess sins and blessings. One should bathe, fast, and perform the **Great Offering of the Yuan Capital** to pray for grace and repent transgressions.

The **three Assembly days** are: the seventh day of the first month (**Assembly of Promotion and Reward**), the seventh day of the seventh month (**Middle Assembly of Celebrating Life**), and the fifteenth day of the tenth month (**Grand Assembly of Establishing Merit**). On these three Assembly days, the **Three Officials** examine merits and transgressions. Those who have received **talismans, registers, contracts, and scriptural methods** should fast and present petitions on these days to pray for boundless fortune.

The **five La days** are: the first day of the first month (**Celestial La**), the fifth day of the fifth month (**Earthly La**), the seventh day of the seventh month (**Virtue-and-Power La**), the first day of the tenth month (**People’s Yearly La**), and the **La day** of the twelfth month (**Kings and Lords’ La**). On these five La days, one should always sacrifice to and commemorate the departed, offering blessings and remembrance. Those who do so are called filial children and shall receive immeasurable fortune. Other days are termed **licentious sacrifices** and incur sin. Together with the three Yuan days, these are called the **eight Liberation days**, on which one may set out pure offerings to seek blessings.

The essentials of fasting require abstaining from rich flavors, fatty foods, pungent spices, smoked meats, wine, lust, yin influences, malice, jealousy, and all evil deeds. One should only burn incense, light lamps, recite scriptures, and perform repentance, praying that all may be spared from disasters and calamities—this is true fasting. The blessings of fasting are boundless in merit and virtue, surpassing all in protecting life and delivering the dead.

In the ninth month and ninth day of the third year of **Yongshou**, the **Celestial Master** transformed at **Yuntai** in **Guizhou**. At midday, flying immortals, five-colored cloud-dragons, divine cranes, and immortal deer came to welcome him, escorting him as he ascended to heaven alongside his disciples **Wang Chang** and **Zhao Sheng**.

The **Successor Master**, the Celestial Master’s son, styled **Lingzhen** and named **Heng**, concealed himself to practice the ancestral arts. In the second year of **Guanghe**, on the fifteenth day of the first month, he transformed and ascended at **Yangping**.

The **Lineage Master**, **Lu**, styled **Gongqi**, was the Successor Master’s son. He served as **General of Special Authority and Pacifier of the South**, and **Governor of Liang and Yi Prefectures** under the **Great Wei**. Later, he retired to cultivate the transmitted teachings and, in the sixth year of **Zhengshi**, on the eighth month, also transformed and ascended at **Yangping**.

The Celestial Master once composed a preface to the *Scripture of the Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor of Great Clarity*, which in summary states: The subtleties of divine transformation, the essential and marvelous words, the supreme principle beyond reason, the great truth that is not yet so—these are all fully expounded in the profound tradition, not to be conveyed by the slightest trace. **Laozi** further elucidated the profound and empty, becoming the chronicler of the Dao. His divine virtue and the circumstances of his inspiration led him to compose scriptures, establish teachings, record extraordinary accounts, harmonize Dao and the mundane, and distinguish the three realms. First, he illuminated the principles of compliance and opposition, then dissolved them in universal forgetting, extolling those of great virtue. Yet he ultimately unified them under non-dependence, employing utility in egress and ingress. Grass grows without revealing its origin, and the common people daily practice goodness without knowing why—this is the authority manifest in clarity, serving as the bridge for all things.

Its *Scripture of the Dao* and *Scripture of Virtue* trace the lineage to its origin, exhausting the profound and ultimate marvels. They gather all blossoms into the true root, condense myriad strands into one essential, stretching boundlessly without end.

As for the efficacy of the **Golden Elixir**, the true spirit penetrates the lofty and obscure, its form darkly transforming into dragons. The numinous illumination dwells within, reviving the withered and dead, extending the years of those bound by the black of life. Ascending the Milky Way to soar beyond, roaming the cloud peaks in freedom—even to the point of one’s face radiating jade light, one’s body growing wondrous fur, spitting water and rinsing fire, flying without wings, dividing one’s form into myriad transformations, and acting at will. Stopping rivers and seas without a covering basket, splitting mountains and beams without need of a new saw—its divinity is difficult to record, its marvels impossible to lose.

Great indeed is the numinous essential, beyond full description. The *Scripture of Transmitted Immortals* lists the perfected who praise this preface.

He also composed the *Inner Biography of Lord Lao* and prefaced the *Five Talismans of the Numinous Treasure*. These prefaces were stored in the **hidden chamber**. **Wen Ruhai** once mocked him, saying: "In assisting the Han, he could not discourse on the Dao of Lao and Zhuang, yet he distributed talismans and registers in his time. This is the view of the narrow-minded." I humbly disagree.

Examining the preface to the *Gold Elixir*, it states: "The principle without principle is the utmost principle; the non-being that is greatly being." It further declares: "Swept clean to encompass forgetfulness, unified in non-reliance." This profoundly embodies the marvel of Lao-Zhuang’s vision of solitary insight—how could it be dismissed as a narrow view? As for Wen Ruhai’s critique of this text, it seems he had not yet encountered it. Had he seen it, would he still cleave to such dualistic thinking?

The marvel of solitary insight is attained only through personal realization; even the deepest bonds of father and son, elder and younger brother, cannot transmit it. Yet when celestial writings in cloud-script, jade-sealed alchemical manuals, and numinous talismans or precious registers descend from the heavens, their great purpose is to pacify and secure the nation’s destiny, preserving the celestial mandate without end. Lesser applications summon dragons and spirits to dispel floods and droughts; still lesser uses dispel demonic influences and shield the afflicted from suffering. That the Heavenly Master’s teachings flourished only after a thousand generations does not diminish their completeness in origin and outcome—what room remains for doubt?

The transmission from the Most High exhausts its marvels. The *Fasting Methods* bestowed upon Master Ge the Immortal were thus:

Worldly affairs often elude direct perception; to affirm them invites universal confusion, while to deny them risks divine retribution. As the age grows distant from the sages, and personal experience fails to witness such events, one can only consult the bamboo and silk records. During the time of the Heavenly Master in the Han, the Most High’s descents were not singular, nor were his transmissions few—yet later generations, finding no mention in the standard histories, grew skeptical.

Consider Emperor Ming of Han, who dreamed of a golden figure, and the empire flocked to believe as if to a marketplace. Even commoners, wise or foolish, near or far, accepted this. To dismiss what one’s own ears and eyes have not witnessed and thereby sow doubt in later ages—this is the mark of a one-sided scholar. Without extraordinary manifestations of celestial descent, how could one gain the people’s trust? Yet if not for the Grand Ultimate Perfected, who else was fit to receive such a mandate?

The *Original Record* states: In the second year of Guanghe, *jiawei* (179 CE), on the seventh day of the first month, the Primordial One and the Grand Ultimate Perfected descended upon Mount Tiantai, bestowing upon the immortal Ge Xiaoxian thirty-six scrolls of the *Numinous Treasure* scriptures. After some time, the Primordial One returned with three perfected ones, their halos of radiance bearing eight-jeweled jade chariots, canopies, and banners, resplendent in the void, accompanied by ten thousand attendants. He commanded the scripture-attending immortal Wang Sizhen to unfurl the nine-luminous jade cords and present thirty-six scrolls of the *Great Cavern of Primordial Qi*, bestowing them upon Xiaoxian.

The *Upper Clarity* fasting rites comprise two methods:
1. The *Solitary Banquet of the Absolute Palm*, where one stills the qi and forgets the form, entering the fasting of profound quiescence.
2. The *Pure Altar’s Solemnity*, following the rites of the Grand Perfected, first liberating the nine ancestors, then one’s household, and finally atoning for one’s own transgressions.

The *Numinous Treasure* fasting rites encompass six methods:
1. The *Golden Register*, harmonizing yin and yang to safeguard the nation’s destiny.
2. The *Jade Register*, protecting empresses, consorts, dukes, and noble clans.
3. The *Yellow Register*, for ministers, governors, and regional lords to deliver their nine ancestors from karmic origins of sin.
4. The *Alliance with the Perfected*, liberating ancestors and dissolving all karmic entanglements.
5. The *Three Primes*, atoning for one’s own transgressions against the precepts.
6. The *Eight Nodes*, repenting the faults of the seven ancestors and oneself.

Additionally, the *Natural Fasting* universally benefits the myriad people, extending even to oneself, to invoke blessings and repent sins. The *Cavern Spirit Fasting* prizes simplicity and refinement; the *Grand Unity Fasting* values reverence and solemnity; the *Doctrinal Teaching Fasting* esteems purity and restraint; the *Mud and Charcoal Fasting* honors ascetic endurance.

He further bestowed upon Xiaoxian forty-five scrolls, including the *Scripture of Exhortations and Warnings on the Subtle Transference*, the *True Scripture of Exhortations on the Three Wretched Realms, Five Sufferings, and the Roots of Life and Death*, and the *Scripture of the Infinite, Wondrous Transformation of Spirit into Samādhi*, to propagate and transform the world.

In the first year of Chiwu, *wuwu* (238 CE), on the first day of the tenth month, *jiazi*, the Primordial One commanded the Nine Heavens’ Perfected Lords to present a written decree, appointing Xiaoxian as the Left Perfected of the Grand Ultimate. By the seventh year, *jiazi* (244 CE), on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, immortals bearing tablets and banners escorted him as he ascended to heaven in a white deer-drawn chariot.

**The Bestowal of the Grand Peace Perfected Lord’s Title**
That which moves heaven and earth is virtue; that which penetrates the dark and distant is the numinous. The numinous dwells in the heart, while virtue emanates from the Dao. Thus, whether in the hidden or manifest, near or far, vast or minute, transcendent or mortal, the resonance is one and the same.

Formerly, when Master Kou of the Celestial Masters practiced on Mount Songgao, the Most High descended in person, bestowing scriptures, registers, and the title of Perfected Lord. The luminous response of this mutual resonance—was it not the work of virtue and the numinous? Yet Emperor Wu of Wei uniquely adopted the title *Grand Peace Perfected Lord* to name his reign, thereby demonstrating to the world his reverence for the profound and his desire to bless the people—such was his devotion and faith.

According to careful examination: In the second year of Shenrui of Emperor Mingyuan of the Later Wei, *yimao* (415 CE), on the first day of the fourth month, the True Primordial manifested a divided body and descended upon Mount Song. The Daoist Kou Qianzhi was cultivating the Dao there when two divine beings, clad in kingfisher-feathered robes and crowned with purple-gold diadems, riding dragons and bearing tablets, announced: "The Most High Lord Lao has arrived." Soon after, celestial music filled the air as Lord Lao arrived in a nine-dragon-drawn chariot, his majesty resplendent, surrounded by an entourage of immortals filling the void. They alighted upon the mountain’s summit, where five celestial officials stood in attendance. Qianzhi saw the five palace gates swing open with radiant brilliance as exquisite music played. Lord Lao sat beneath a silver-flowered canopy, and the Perfected Lord Wang Fangping of the Kalpa Immortals led Qianzhi forward to stand before him. He declared: "I have received a memorial from the Master of the Assembly of Immortals, Zhao Hongzheng, recommending your talents to succeed me in aiding the nation and guiding people, that none may fall into evil destinies." He then bestowed upon Qianzhi nine scrolls of scriptures and precepts. The chariot lingered in the void for a moment before vanishing.

In the second year of Taichang, *dingsi* (417 CE), on the fifteenth day of the first month, the True Primordial again bestowed upon Qianzhi over ten scrolls of new talismanic registers. In the eighth year, *guihai* (423 CE), on the fifteenth day of the tenth month, he dispatched the Perfected Lord Li Puwen, Grand Master of the Primordial Descendant, to descend and confer the *Four Registers of the Celestial Palace*, the *Heavenly Crown and Robes of the Immortals*, and the title *Grand Peace Perfected Lord*, along with six celestial fruits.

Kianzhi consumed them and thereafter abstained from grain and fire-prepared food. The True Primordial further commanded the twelve jade maidens, including Changrong, to teach Kianzhi the methods of *daoyin* and the ingestion of black *qi*. In the *jiazi* year (424 CE), the first month’s reign title was changed to Shiguang. Kianzhi, bearing the scriptures, entered the capital to propagate the Dao and reported all in full.

Emperor Taiwu ordered his officials to present sacrificial silk and perform the rites of announcement, then issued an imperial edict: “Our sagely teacher, the Most High Lord Lao, has descended in person to bestow upon Us the title *Grand Peace Perfected Lord*, along with the celestial crown, robes, talismans, and registers. Let the era name be changed to the first year of *Grand Peace Perfected Lord*, and let a general amnesty be proclaimed throughout the realm.” Emperor Taiwu received the talismanic registers, and all banners and flags were henceforth made in blue, adopting the color of the Daoist tradition. Thereafter, all officials within and beyond the court, when submitting memorials, addressed the emperor as *Grand Peace Perfected Lord Emperor*. The emperor further decreed that the Daoist teachings should rank above the Western teachings.

From Emperor Taiwu onward, each succeeding emperor upon ascending the throne received the registers. On the twenty-fifth day of the fifth month of that year, Kianzhi concealed his transformation within the Tranquil Wheel Palace; a dark mist issued from his mouth, ascending like smoke into the heavens. He was then eighty-four years old. On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, Shen Youxing of Shuzhou saw Kianzhi on Mount Song—his body shone like silver, radiant as the sun, and he slowly ascended into the sky. This was none other than the attainment of the Way to the moon.

Later, Emperor Wu of the Northern Zhou established the Office of Comprehensive Mystery to enshrine Daoist images and summoned masters from all directions to expound the *Upper* and *Lower Scriptures*. Emperor Wen of the Sui built his capital at Dragon Head Plain, naming it the City of Great Prosperity. He instructed the Grand Architect Yuwen Kai to select an auspicious site and establish thirty-six Daoist abbeys, renaming them *Altars of the Immortals*. Their purity, emptiness, and splendor surpassed all previous ages.

The Sacred Ancestor of the Great Tang
The Great Tang’s possession of the realm was founded upon reverence for the Most High as its Sacred Ancestor, and the rites of veneration accorded to Him were unmatched in former ages—just as the Sacred Song honored its imperial lineage and traced its immortal origins to the Yellow Emperor as its Sacred Ancestor. During the reign of Emperor Zhenzong, the True One descended to the Hall of Realized Wanderings; the details are recorded in the *Record of Descents*. Yet the Most High’s manifestations during the Tang began with Emperor Gaozu and continued through Emperor Xizong, with many instances in between, all recorded in the dynastic histories.

According to the annals, in the thirteenth year of Daye of the Sui (617 CE), the Lord Lao dispatched the spirit of Mount Huo to inform the Duke of Tang: “In the future, you shall surely obtain the realm.” Many words were spoken but are not recorded here. In the first year of Wude of the Gaozu Emperor (618 CE), the Lord Lao appeared on Sheep Horn Mountain in Fushan County, Jinzhou, to Ji Shanxing. Shanxing was a native of Quwo County in Jiangzhou, a man of sincere and guileless nature, his words free of deceit or flattery.

At that time, the rebel Liu Wuzhou had sent his general Song Jingang to invade southward into Jin and Jiang prefectures, and the Prince of Qin was defending Jiangzhou. Shanxing, seeking refuge, had settled in Datong Fort in Linfen County, Jinzhou. On the twenty-third day of the second month, the local elders sent Shanxing to Sheep Horn Mountain to watch for the rebels from atop the ridge between two clusters of willows. There he saw a man riding a white horse approaching from the northern slope. Struck by the sight, Shanxing walked north to the base of a sweet pear tree. The rider had already arrived—his beard and hair were snowy white, his garments pure white, his cap black, his horse white, its tail and hooves crimson. A young boy of about thirteen or fourteen, his head wrapped, wearing a dark green Korean-style robe, stood in attendance. One attendant held a towel, another a red whisk. The rider addressed Shanxing: “Go and tell the Son of Heaven of the Great Tang: ‘You have now attained sagely governance, and the altars of soil and grain shall endure long. You should establish an Abbey of Pacified Transformation in the eastern part of Chang’an and enshrine the Daoist images; then the realm will know grand peace.’” With these words, he soared into the void and vanished.

On the night of the twenty-seventh day of the fourth month of that year, someone again summoned Shanxing to his home. At dawn, he arrived at the same spot and saw the rider as before, clad in white, wearing a golden crown. The rider asked: “Do you remember what I told you earlier?” Shanxing replied: “I remember.” The old man said: “Go at once and report to the Son of Heaven what I have said.” Shanxing pleaded poverty and lack of writing materials, asking how he dared make such a report. The old man said: “Your future path is assured.” Shanxing said: “To see the Son of Heaven is no small matter; how shall I prove my words upon reaching the capital?” The old man replied: “When you arrive in the capital, there will be one who presents a stone tortoise—let that be your proof.” With these words, he disappeared.

On the fifth day of the fifth month, Shanxing recounted these events to He Ruo Yiyi, the Chief Administrator of the Jinzhou General’s Office, who detained him. On the eleventh day of the fifth month, Shanxing was brought before the Prince of Qin and recounted in full the apparition of the divine being. He was hastily appointed to the post of *Qing*. Soon after, the Left Personal Guard Commander-in-Chief Du Ang was dispatched with Shanxing to the site of the apparition to perform the rites. On the thirteenth day of the fifth month, as they prepared to offer the sacrifice, the old man suddenly appeared amidst purple clouds, just as Shanxing had described. Raising his whip, he pointed at Du Ang and asked: “Who are you?” Du Ang replied: “I am the emissary of the Prince of Qin, come to offer this sacrifice.” The old man said: “I neither eat nor drink—what need have I of sacrifice?” Then, pointing at Shanxing, he said: “All matters are known to this man.” Du Ang returned and reported the old man’s reappearance. Following the command, he wrote a memorial and, together with Shanxing, hastened by post to the capital.

On the nineteenth day of the fifth month, they arrived at the capital and stood at the gate of the audience hall. Before they could settle, Zhang Da of Nazhou presented a stone resembling a tortoise, inscribed with the words: “The realm is at peace, descendants flourish, for a thousand myriad generations, for a thousand myriad years.” Together they entered to make their report, and Emperor Gaozu was greatly pleased. On the eleventh day of the sixth month, an edict appointed Shanxing *Chaosan Daifu* and bestowed upon him one hundred bolts of silk. On the sixth day of the seventh month, the emperor ordered the Palace Attendant Liu Min to establish a temple at the site of the apparition on Sheep Horn Mountain and renamed Fushan County *Divine Mountain County*.

On the twenty-fifth day of the eighth month, the old man again sent someone to summon Shanxing. The next day, Shanxing went to the temple and saw the old man between two trees, seated upon a canopied ivory couch, leaning on a curved armrest. A vermilion-flowered gauze net draped above him, and two blue-clad youths stood in attendance. Behind him, a yellow-robed man held the horse.

He addressed Shanxing, saying: "Does the Son of Heaven rejoice?"
Shanxing replied: "He rejoices greatly."
The old man asked further: "What causes him doubt?"
Shanxing answered: "He wonders at not knowing the sage’s name."
The old man said: "I am the Supreme Divine Immortal, surnamed Li, styled Boyang, known as Lord Lao, the Imperial Ancestor. The *Records of the Grand Historian* contains my biography. In Guyang County of Bozhou stands a withered cypress that shall revive as proof. Now that the rebels are pacified, the realm enjoys great peace, and the dynasty shall endure for ages."

With these words, he suddenly vanished. Shanxing immediately reported this to He Ruo Xiaoyi, who dispatched Xili County’s Chief Clerk Xi Tong to ride post-haste with Shanxing and make their report. On the fifth day of the tenth month, they were received by Emperor Gaozu, who rejoiced greatly, bestowing upon Shanxing an imperial robe and forty bolts of silk. All officials offered their congratulations.

On the seventh day of the twelfth month that year, Shanxing arrived at the temple site and again saw Lord Lao seated upon a square dais, resting against a jade-inlaid armrest, with over ten immortal youths and attendants standing to his left and right. After Shanxing paid his obeisance, he suddenly vanished.

On the seventeenth day of the third month in the fifth year, Shanxing went to the temple site and saw true immortals arrayed in attendance within the hall, divine soldiers in escort, all riding azure dragons and white beasts, with banners, pennants, and standards filling the air. Lord Lao said to Shanxing: "The withered cypress in my temple in Bozhou has revived. The Tang has attained sagely governance, and my descendants shall rule. I have dispatched the Duke of Zhou, Dan, with a million divine troops to aid the state in suppressing Liu Heida. By the fourth month, he shall be defeated."

He Ruo Xiaoyi then sent Staff Officer Jing Qing to ride post-haste with Shanxing and urge him to travel by relay carriage to the army at Luozhou, delivering the edict and proclamation. On the twenty-first day of the fourth month, Liu Heida was indeed pacified. Thus, the realm was greatly stabilized, and the withered cypress revived.

During the Kaiyuan era, an edict renamed Sheep Horn Mountain *Dragon Horn Mountain* and the temple *Qing Tang Abbey*. The illustrious emperor composed an inscription for the stele, and the true visages of successive sages were all enshrined there.

On the eighth day of the sixth month that year, Shanxing arrived at the temple site and saw Lord Lao as before. After paying his obeisance, he soon vanished.

In the third year of Wude, Emperor Gaozu issued an edict appointing Wang Yuanzhi, a Daoist of Jinyang, as *Chaoqing Daifu*, bestowing upon him a gold-threaded coronet and a purple silk cloud-patterned robe, in recognition of his prophecy confirming the divine mandate of the Sacred Emperor. Taizong later promoted Yuanzhi to *Yinqing Guanglu Daifu*. During Empress Wu’s reign, he was posthumously honored as *Jinzi Guanglu Daifu* for his foresight, which accorded with the words of the Supreme Lord, thus warranting the decree. The granting of purple robes to feathered immortals began from this time.

On the twenty-fifth day of the first month in the eleventh year of Zhenguan, Emperor Taizong issued an edict, saying:

"Consider how Lord Lao established his model, with its essence in purity and emptiness, while the Buddha left his precepts, with its principle in cause and effect. Though their teachings differ in method, both aim to guide and uplift. Though their doctrines diverge in origin, both foster great benefit and equal virtue.

The great Dao’s practice began in remote antiquity, its source arising before the nameless, its affairs transcending form. It surpasses the two modes in its operations and encompasses the myriad things in its nurturance. Thus, it can govern the state and bring order, returning to simplicity and restoring purity.

The rise of Buddhism, rooted in the Western Regions, spread to the Central Land during the Eastern Han. Its principles of divine transformation are manifold, and its karmic retribution is not uniform. In recent times, reverence for it has deepened. People seek blessings in this life and fear calamities in the next. Thus, the vulgar scoff at the profound teachings, while those fond of the strange vie to return to the true essence. The tide surged through villages and towns, and the wind swept through the court. As a result, the customs of foreign lands flourished as the foremost of all wonders, while the teachings of the Central Land were relegated behind the single vehicle. The current has flowed unchecked for years, and none have turned back.

I, with reverent awe, contemplate the supreme Dao, seeking to reform past abuses and guide all things to their proper course. Moreover, my lineage descends from the Lord of the Pillar, and the prosperity of the imperial house relies on the blessing of his virtue. The realm’s great stability also owes to the merit of non-action. It is fitting to make changes and propagate this true transformation.

Henceforth, in matters of fasting, offerings, conduct, and even forms of address, Daoist priests and female Daoist adepts shall take precedence over Buddhist monks and nuns. May this help to rectify customs across the nine lands and perpetuate the wind of ancestral reverence for ten thousand generations."

The edict was proclaimed throughout the realm, and the responsible officials were to implement it.

In the second year of Longshuo during Emperor Gaozong’s reign, while in the palace at Luoyang, he was suddenly moved and inquired of those nearby: "What ancient sites are here?"

The elderly minister presented his memorial, saying: "North of the imperial city lies a mountain with a shrine to Laozi, where prayers have always elicited divine responses. The former Prefect of Luozhou, Duke Xu of Qiao, Lord Li Shi, specially built a pure temple there. During construction, a stone table and an ancient stele were unearthed, inscribed with the words: *Stele of the Perfected One, Lord Bo*. The text was fragmentary and could not be fully deciphered, but it was erected by the immortal Bo Zhongli. The stone table measured four *chi* in length, two *chi* in width, two *cun* in thickness, and eight *cun* in height, with four legs at each end. Upon it were carved the words *The Most High Lord Lao*.

Upon the temple’s completion, the former Palace Attendant Supervisor and Director of the Palace Chambers, Quan Dafang, was appointed overseer, along with Daoist priests Guo Xingzhen, Huang Yuanyi, Liu Daohe, and others. On the night of the twenty-seventh day of the second month of that year, they established a Daoist ritual platform and held a grand jiao offering. As soon as the rites concluded, a white radiance enveloped the hall and illuminated the tiered altars. Lord Lao appeared within the light—his beard and hair snowy white, clad in white robes—flanked by two attendants. After lingering for a long while, he vanished. Yang Hushi, Recorder of Luozhou, and thirteen others witnessed this together. The event was reported in a memorial, and an imperial decree ordered the vision to be painted and titled *Auspicious Image of Lord Lao*. The hundred officials submitted a congratulatory memorial, saying:

'Lord Lao, though transcending the imperial age, has repeatedly manifested auspicious signs. Your Imperial Majesty, in moments of leisure from governance, has turned your thoughts to the wondrous gate of the Dao, thus restoring the sacred image and erecting a lofty temple. Like the soaring phoenix on the raven’s path or the towering eaves piercing the clouds, this hall now opens its windows to reveal celestial blessings. Here, the divine countenance of the Sage beneath the Pillar scatters radiant light across the altars, while immortal attendants in the rafters cast wondrous reflections upon the courtyard steps. Such perfect resonance with utmost sincerity befits your sagely virtue, spreading distant blessings to the seven ancestral temples and securing the grand design for a hundred million generations. How could this be compared to the fleeting glory of Yu’s auspicious omens, the Han’s propitious airs, or the descent of sacred birds at sacrifices—mere echoes of dynastic splendor?'

Another decree ordered the construction of a Pure Palace to the left of the temple gates as a changing chamber for the emperor. Each year, the court would dispatch incense trays, banners, canopies, and the music of the Grand Music Bureau to escort the imperial procession. The celebration of ancestral reverence was unmatched in ancient or modern times.

On the twenty-eighth day of the second month in the first year of Qianfeng, after the emperor completed the Feng and Shan sacrifices at Mount Tai and returned to his capital, he journeyed to Bozhou to pay homage. There, he respectfully bestowed the exalted title *True Origin Emperor* upon Laozi, with the following inscription:

'The Great Dao, self-formed and prior to the Two Modes, establishes its name. The Perfected One, emptying himself, speaks with the subtlety of the myriad things. Consider Lord Lao: the root of Our lineage. From the time of Fuxi to the end of the Zhou, his numinous responses knew no form, his transformations myriad. Ascending upon primordial *qi*, descending with the essence of the sun, he moved freely through the cosmos, exhaling and inhaling wind and clouds. At times, he was teacher and friend to emperors, his wondrous transformations recorded in cinnabar and ink. Like yin and yang, he was unfathomable; like the sun and moon, he hung in the heavens. When the stars fell into misalignment and the age darkened, he withdrew to the Pillar, leaving behind the grand and elegant teachings of the *Hongya* to serve as a model for posterity. Though his heart equaled the Great Void, his principles returned to the True Sovereign.

As for transcending sageliness and abandoning cunning, calming the spirit and reducing desires, dwelling in stillness and non-action, and finding contentment in natural ease—his wisdom is inexhaustible when drawn upon, never depleted in use. Grasping the Great Image to restore simplicity, cleansing the primordial vision to cast off burdens, he endures beyond heaven and earth, nurturing all things with the potter’s wheel. Perfect indeed! Truly, no name can encompass him.

The imperial house, drawing upon his great sageliness, flourishes in its sacred mandate. Treading the path of supreme virtue, it aligns with the most auspicious era. We, inheriting the numinous mandate, govern the multitudes, gazing upon the brilliance of the Three Luminaries with reverence day and night, bearing the weight of the Four Great Elements with awe in waking and sleeping. We exhaust filial piety toward the ancestral shrines and extend harmonious care to the seen and unseen. Practicing the Dao of purity and stillness, we inherit the transformation of Great Peace. Ascending the sacred mound to perform rites, sitting in the Bright Hall to receive blessings, we witness auspicious vapors ascending and double wheels of fortune descending. Cranes respond to the Nine Songs, mountains echo with ten thousand years of acclaim. Surpassing antiquity in gathering blessings, Our reign stands foremost among emperors past.

After the grand rites concluded, We returned to the capital, then diverted Our carriage to Lai Xiang to personally offer libations of peppered wine. Gazing upon the auspicious vision, We lingered in longing; embracing the sacred spring, We sighed deeply. The thought of his presence runs deep, and the sentiment of revering our origins grows ever more earnest. It is fitting to illuminate the profound mystery of Our origins and manifest the great sageliness of the Sage. Let the title *True Origin Emperor* be bestowed upon him, and *Primordial Heaven Empress* upon his mother. Furthermore, let Guyang County be renamed *True Source County*, and let the ancestral lineage be granted a one-year exemption from taxes. May this express Our devotion to distant ancestors and fulfill the principle of revering Our origins.'

The decree was proclaimed throughout the realm, and the responsible officials were to implement it."

The Emperor had the Shuming Abbey constructed for the late Empress Wende of the Great Ancestral Clan and Emperor Taizong, showcasing the finest craftsmanship in earth and timber and adorned with lavish gold and azure embellishments. Its grandeur and magnificence were unparalleled. The Emperor and the Empress personally attended the ritual feast, and the assembled courtiers, rejoicing and offering felicitations, all hailed "Long live the Emperor!"

In the fourth month, fourth day of the fourth Yifeng year, the Emperor dispatched Daoist priest Zheng Yuanyin to the shrine at Northern Yushan, where he performed the Dao with Daoist priests Luo Wuguang and twenty-four others. On the first day of the fifth month at the hour of *chou*, Daoist priest Kou Yi, stationed at the western side of the altar near the eastern gate of the hall, witnessed the Lord Lao descending upon the altar astride a crimson-roan white horse, accompanied by a youth in blue robes. Auspicious light illuminated the space, penetrating both within and without. The Lord Lao addressed Kou Yi, saying, "Our grandson shall enjoy a long and prosperous reign." With these words, he vanished.

Sun Rui, the overseer of the northern palace gardens, reported the vision, whereupon the hundred officials presented a memorial of congratulation, saying: "We have heard that the August One of Primordial Chaos manifested at the shrine, his golden countenance and jade radiance outshining the brilliance of nocturnal luminaries. His white steed with crimson mane left traces upon the celestial thoroughfare, while the blue-robed youth, leading at dawn, descended in harmony with the jade chimes."

Purple clouds spread across the night sky, ascending high to shroud the Silver River. Thus was the imperial lineage firmly prospered, the celestial mandate renewed, and Our August Rule extended—crowning the myriad people. Had it not been for the sagely reverence that mysteriously communed with the unseen, who else could have partaken in such a blessing? This is what is meant by the Dao surpassing all kings, felicity flourishing through ten thousand generations, the precious throne enduring, and its enjoyment without end.

The Emperor, upon reading the memorial, was greatly pleased. He further decreed: "Henceforth, Daoist priests shall be placed under the jurisdiction of the Court of the Imperial Clan, and in all processions and assemblies, they may stand immediately after the imperial princes."

In the first year of the Wenming era, the cyclical year *jiashen* (684 CE), Empress Wu assumed regency and sought to elevate the Wu clan to royal status. In that year, on the eighteenth day of the second month, Lord Lao descended and manifested upon the Royal Heaven Plain in Fangxing Village, Longtai Township, Que County, Hao Prefecture. He dispatched Zou Yuanchong of Yuzhang County, Hong Prefecture, to convey a message to the Empress, declaring that the imperial house would enjoy enduring prosperity and perpetual peace.

Initially, Yuanchong saw six immortals descending from the northwest upon rosy clouds, riding crimson dragons and clad in multicolored robes. Two bore pearl banners, while the other four held rainbow streamers and brocade parasols. They addressed Yuanchong, saying, "The Most High Lord Lao approaches," and then passed by. Soon after, an extraordinary fragrance filled the air, and three blue-robed youths appeared, bearing incense burners as they emerged from the northwest clouds, likewise passing before Yuanchong. Then came two more blue-robed attendants, each holding a red whisk and *ruyi* scepter, smiling as they went by. Next, four immortals riding azure dragons, each bearing banners and standards, spoke to Yuanchong: "The Most High Lord Lao approaches and wishes to speak with you." With these words, they too passed on.

Presently, amid the five-colored clouds, Yuanchong beheld a Daoist riding a white beast resembling a mule, its tail and mane crimson. The Daoist wore pale yellow robes, his hair and beard white, and a floral crown of golden hue upon his head. He said to Yuanchong, "I am the Most High Lord Lao, the primal ancestor of your sovereign." Yuanchong immediately prostrated himself twice. The Lord called to him, "Follow me, and I shall speak with you." Yuanchong then ascended the clouds with Lord Lao, rising several *zhang* above the earth. Behind the Lord, six immortals rode dragons, each girded with a Seven-Star precious sword and bearing objects Yuanchong could not recognize. They wore floral crowns and grand, multicolored robes, their radiance dazzling, and stood in attendance to his left and right.

Behind them came a cloud chariot, resplendent with variegated adornments. Atop the chariot was a great jeweled canopy, from which banners and flowers hung, encircled by five-colored clouds. More dragon-riding immortals, bearing standards and banners, attended in countless numbers, all tall of stature. Music preceded and followed the procession.

At that moment, over five hundred travelers from beyond the pass, along with the officials and common folk of Que County, witnessed the auspicious marvel and all bowed in reverence from afar. In an instant, Yuanchong found himself back upon the earth. He duly reported all that had transpired.

Though the Empress was initially displeased, she ultimately refrained from harming him. Instead, she converted the Que County temporary palace into the Fengxian Abbey, and her reckless ambitions gradually subsided. Before long, a mountain emerged in Xinfeng County, rising three hundred *chi* in height, and the prefecture was renamed Qingshan County. These and other auspicious omens were recorded in the *Veritable Records of Empress Wu*. This occurred on the fifth day of the ninth month in the second year of the Chuigong era, the cyclical year *bingxu* (686 CE). Was this not a sign that the Empress, through her sincerity, had manifested the omen of the nation’s earthly virtue being revived?

Eventually, she abdicated in favor of Emperor Zhongzong. Upon ascending the throne, the Emperor changed the era name to Jinglong and decreed that each prefecture throughout the realm establish an abbey, all to bear the name Jinglong. In the second year, these were renamed Zhongxing Abbeys, and in the third year, Longxing Abbeys, with Daoist registrations continuing as before.

In the third year of the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Ming (715 CE), it was decreed that Kaiyuan Abbeys be established throughout the empire. The Emperor composed the *Eulogy to the Primordial One*, which read:

> Behold the supreme virtue,
> Born to long years.
> White locks frame his visage,
> Purple qi floats in the heavens.
> To the west of the Hangu Pass,
> Five thousand characters remain.
> The Dao that is not the constant Dao,
> Profound beyond profundity.

The Emperor personally inscribed this in *bafen* script upon a red-powdered board and hung it above the canopy of the Hall of the Great Sage Ancestor.

In the eleventh year (723 CE), he further decreed that True Lord Temples be established on each of the Five Sacred Mountains, and that Purple Ultimate Palaces be built in every circuit. In the thirteenth year (725 CE), he ordered the construction of the Supreme Clarity Palace in the capital, the Supreme Tenuity Palace in the eastern capital, the Purple Tenuity Palace in the northern capital at the former residence of Emperor Shenyuan, the Initiating Sage Palace in the former palace of Pei Prefecture, and the Ascending Dragon Palace. Each was furnished with ceremonial robes, crimson gauze curtains, canopies, and crossed dragon-gate halberds, mirroring the splendor of the imperial palaces.

In Pu Prefecture, a jade-like stone was unearthed, shaped like a half-moon, upon which was carved the image of an immortal pounding medicine. When struck, it emitted a clear, resonant sound. The Emperor commanded it be hung in the courtyard of the Zhenyuan Temple in Taiyuan, naming it the Recumbent Moon Chime.

Zhang Qi, the military governor of the eastern capital, memorialized: "In Lushan County, Ruzhou, while renovating the ancient abbey of the Immortal’s Residence, a jade chime was discovered. When struck, its sound carried for several *li*." The Emperor ordered it hung in the courtyard of the Supreme Clarity Abbey’s Hall of the Sage Ancestor.

In Qu Prefecture, during the construction of an abbey, a fish-shaped object was unearthed, measuring three *chi* in length. It resembled iron, with a faint purplish-green hue, yet also like green stone, its surface lustrous and intricately carved—seemingly beyond human craft. When struck, it produced a resonant tone, though the fish itself could not be identified. It was sent to the court, where the Emperor displayed it to the assembled officials, none of whom could discern its nature. The Emperor thus named it the Auspicious Fish Chime and ordered it hung in the Supreme Tenuity Palace, to be struck only during sutra lectures and vegetarian feasts.

Thereafter, the various abbeys and palaces competed to replicate it in wood and stone as a substitute for summoning assemblies.

The Emperor further decreed that all abbeys be overseen by the chief ministers and the military governors of their respective circuits, establishing this as a permanent institution.

The Emperor further composed the *Rainbow Skirts and Feathered Robes Melody* and the *Purple Ultimate Eight Trigrams Dance*, offering them at the Supreme Tenuity Palace to honor it above the Nine Ancestral Temples. After concluding the Feng and Shan sacrifices, he returned to pay homage to the Sacred Ancestor at the original abbey in Bozhou, where he personally inscribed the *Daoist Classic* upon stone, erected a great banner, and built an octagonal tower to shelter it before the Hall of Void and Nothingness. He also visited the Kaiyuan Abbey in Huaizhou and the Fengxian Abbey in Quexiang, praying on behalf of the nobles and the common people, and likewise inscribed the two classics in his own hand upon twin standing stones, following the same design as at the Supreme Tenuity Palace. These remain to this day.

At that time, an edict appointed Yuan Chong as Prefect of Dizhou. In the ninth year of the Kaiyuan era, the xin year, an ancient cypress stood before the Hall of Void and Nothingness at the former residence of the Venerable Lord in Bozhou. Though it had withered with age, the Daoist priests sought to fell it. As they cut into the wood, each severed fragment bore the vermilion characters *Qian yuan heng li zhen* ("Primal Origin, Flourishing, Beneficial, Steadfast"), their strokes exquisitely formed. The matter was fully reported to the throne. The imperial decree proclaimed: "The auspicious tree manifests numinous signs; wondrous script appears of itself. This serves to proclaim great fortune and bless the grand enterprise."

Aligning the Five Virtues with the *Book of Changes*,
ushering myriad generations into propitious fortune—
it is fitting first to offer sincere thanksgiving,
then to compile and submit this to the court historians.

The inscribed fragments thus obtained shall be stored in the inner treasury.
Moreover, they shall be bestowed upon the imperial princes, chief ministers, and Daoist communities.

On the fifteenth day of the fourth month in the jisi year of the Kaiyuan era’s seventeenth year, Zhang Jingzhong, Chief Administrator of the Yi Prefecture Grand Protectorate, memorialized: The Great Sage Ancestor, the Perfected Primordial August Emperor, manifested upon a pillar of the Buddha Hall in Xinxing Convent, Xinjin County, Shuzhou, under his jurisdiction. Naturally concealed and raised wood-grain formed the image of the Venerable Lord, a sacred canopy crowning his head, with cloud-leaf celestial blossoms—thirteen in all—adorning his feet before and behind, left and right.

The investigating officer, Wang Dazhong, Assistant Administrator and Merit Officer of Yi Prefecture, together with Li Zhongyun, Prefect of Shuzhou; Lu Fang, Vice Prefect; Li Shao, County Magistrate; and one hundred thirty Daoist priests and Buddhist nuns, jointly attested: The natural wood-grain revealed the true countenance in concealed relief. The numinous traces were wondrously subtle; washing only rendered them clearer. No carving could achieve this, nor could any chisel match it.

We humbly submit that the Most High Venerable Lord, the Great Sage of Prior Heaven, has from antiquity extended his blessings, his transformations ceaseless and unconstrained, his hidden manifestations unfathomable. In the time of the Yellow Emperor, he answered to the name of Guangcheng; in the days of King Wen of Zhou, he held the post of Keeper of the Pillars.

In the early years of the Wude reign, he personally manifested at Yangjiao; in the Kaiyuan era of our present age, he descended with auspicious omens upon Xinxing. Such felicitous portents outshine even those of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. Thus the county bears the name Xinjin, and the temple is called Xinxing. Auspicious blossoms encircle it, revealing that its fragrant radiance shall never fade. The numinous canopy hovers above, demonstrating the eternal nobility of the luminous treasure. Appearing upon the temple pillar, it evokes the distant years of the Pillar Keeper; shining upon the Buddhist shrine, it recalls the ancient days of the Huahu transformation. Though the phoenix nested in the Xuanyuan Tower and the qilin crouched in the Zhou court, how could they compare to the descent of the Divine Ancestor and the flourishing of the Sagely Grandson’s mandate?

We humbly beseech that the Nine Ancestral Temples rejoice in this decree, that his glory be proclaimed in harmony with the Two Modes, and that, in accordance with ancient precedents, a reverent title be conferred. Thereafter, let it be recorded by the historiographers and proclaimed throughout the realm.

On the twenty-fourth day of the fifth month, the eunuch attendant Lin Zhaoyin was dispatched to convey the image-bearing pillar into the palace, where it was enshrined in the Datong Hall. The temples and abbeys of the Two Streets were further commanded to venerate it for seven days before returning it to the palace.

Inscription:
The Dao’s essence knows no bounds,
Yet its hidden origin responds.
Its form marked the Pillar Keeper,
Its name proclaimed at Xinxing.
The ancestral temples bestow blessings,
The living multitudes receive fortune.
Fit to be entrusted to the Historiographers’ Office,
And proclaimed to the four quarters.

On the seventeenth day of the same month, the cyclical day *guimao*, as the Emperor was preparing to journey north of the Wei River, he suddenly dreamed of the True Origin, who said: "You have reigned long over the realm. Now the Northern Spirit is absent, and you must not proceed. Hasten to cancel the journey, and good fortune shall soon follow." In the middle of the night, he issued an edict to abandon the expedition to the north of the Wei. At dawn, a great rain poured into the Jing and Wei Rivers, causing them to overflow for more than ten days before subsiding.

In the twenty-first year, *guiyou*, the Emperor personally annotated the *Daodejing* and composed its preface, decreeing that every household among the scholar-officials and commoners should keep a copy. The Two Streets vied to display banners, streamers, and music, escorting the text from the palace to the Taiqing Abbey. The splendor of incense and flowers was unmatched in recent memory. He further established Daoist examinations, modeled on the system of the Ministry of Rites.

On the seventh day of the first month in the twenty-ninth year, the Attendant Gentleman of the Chen Prince’s Estate, Tian Tongxiu, suddenly beheld at Danfeng Gate a purple cloud rising from the northwest to illuminate the tower. He also saw the Primordial One riding a white horse, attended by two followers and two youths, who addressed Tongxiu, saying: "When I once departed with Yin Xi for the Flowing Sands, I concealed a golden casket containing a sacred talisman in Yin Xi’s former residence in the old Peach Grove Pass. You must petition the Emperor to retrieve it." Tongxiu reported the matter in full.

The Emperor dispatched the eunuch attendant Li Zhizhong to supervise Tongxiu in searching for it at the ruins of the old Hangu Pass, twelve *li* south of Taolin County in Shanzhou. Suddenly, a purple cloud and a white hare appeared beneath a withered mulberry tree. They dug there, descending to the water’s edge, and recovered a stone casket containing a golden coffer and jade tablets inscribed with vermilion seal script. The Emperor, upon receiving the report, rejoiced greatly. He ordered the capital’s ten musical ensembles to perform songs, dances, and wind instruments, welcoming the text through Tonghua Gate. Within the sacred palanquin, it radiated five-colored light, illuminating heaven and earth.

The Emperor, standing atop Danfeng Tower, donned a dragon robe and held a golden censer. The ladies of the six palaces, competing to burn incense and scatter flowers, bowed from afar. The Emperor commanded gold coins to be scattered below the tower, allowing officials and commoners to gather them in celebration. In an instant, the cheers of "Long live the Emperor!" shook the capital. The sacred talisman was then enshrined in the Lingchang Hall. That night, divine lamps appeared upon the towers, pavilions, and trees. Thus, the thirtieth year of the Kaiyuan era was changed to the first year of the Tianbao era.

Three years later, the Emperor noticed the characters "Tianbao, a thousand years" on the sacred talisman, which corresponded to the new era name. He then altered the year-count to *zai*. At the site of the discovery, a dispute over the land at Changle was resolved by establishing the Tianbao Abbey. The Emperor composed an inscription for the sacred talisman and erected it at the place of its manifestation. He also bestowed upon Tongxiu the rank of Regular Fifth-Rank Official in the palace’s Lingfu Hall. The chief ministers requested the addition of the honorific title "Divine and Martial" to the Kaiyuan and Tianbao era names. The Emperor approved, and a general amnesty was proclaimed throughout the realm.

In the intercalary fourth month of the same year, on the cyclical day *gengzi*, the Emperor dreamed of the Primordial One, who said: "I have long resided in the southwest of the city. I shall meet you at Xingqing Palace. Hasten to welcome me." The Emperor told his chief ministers, Li Linfu and Niu Xianke: "For nearly thirty years, I have ruled the realm without fail, rising before dawn each day to don court robes and pay reverence to the true image, praying for the welfare of all living beings. Recently, while resting, I dreamed of the Primordial One."

He dispatched eunuch attendants and the Daoist master Su Yuanyi to search the southwest of the city for several days. Suddenly, in the valleys of Louguan Mountain, a purple cloud appeared, and a white light reached the heavens. Beneath it, they unearthed a jade statue of Lord Lao, over three *chi* in height, and presented it to the throne. That day, the Emperor was at the Datong Hall of Xingqing Palace. He personally went forth to welcome it, and the dream’s words about Xingqing were fulfilled. The statue was enshrined in the inner palace for veneration. He further ordered the reproduction of its true image to be distributed to abbeys throughout the realm, and a general amnesty was proclaimed.

In the ninth month of the same year, Chen Xilie, Academician of the Chongyuan Institute, along with the Daoist Xiao Congyi and thirteen others, suddenly saw at the Taiqing Gate a light like the moon, within which a purple cloud arose. Two azure-clad youths descended gently, and Lord Lao, clad in white, stood amidst the clouds. Holding a whisk in his left hand, he addressed Xilie and the others, saying: "I am the Primordial August Emperor. Report to my descendant that you are true persons of the upper realms. I shall ever be at your side, eternally guarding your lives, dispelling calamities, and ensuring peace throughout the realm." With these words, he vanished into the dark clouds at the palace gate.

The memorial was duly submitted, and an imperial edict approved its inclusion in the records of the Historiography Institute.

In the fifth year, the Emperor dreamed of the Primordial August Emperor, who declared: "I possess numinous responses; soon I shall arrive of my own accord." Thereupon, a sacred talisman and jade tablets were obtained from Mount Tai Bai. Upon their conveyance to the capital, they were enshrined in the Hall of Numinous Talismans, where the Emperor personally attended to their veneration. The mountain spirit of Mount Tai Bai was enfeoffed as Duke of Numinous Response, and the cave where the talisman was discovered was renamed the Auspicious □ Grotto. A True Talisman County was established at the mountain’s foot, and edicts were issued for all circuits to establish True Talisman Abbeys, with the events to be recorded in the Historiography Institute.

In the twelfth month of the same year, on the day *wuxu*, the Emperor visited the Huaqing Palace. On the fourth day of the month, before sunrise, a propitious cloud suddenly enveloped the summit of Mount Li. After a moment, it gradually dispersed, revealing the Primordial August Ancestor manifesting above the Hall of Audience. The Emperor and his attendants gazed in reverence for a long while before the vision faded. By imperial decree, Huichang County was renamed Zhaoying County, and Xinfeng County was incorporated into it. Mount Huichang was renamed Mount Zhaoying, its mountain spirit enfeoffed as Duke of Primordial Virtue, and the Hall of Audience renamed the Pavilion of the Descended Sage. An illustrated account was issued from the palace and distributed throughout the realm, with orders to include it in the records of the Historiography Institute.

In the eighth year, on the day *yichou*, Emperor Minghuang obtained twenty-seven jade statues of immortals in Luochuan County of Ningzhou. He commanded their conveyance to the capital, following the precedent of the early Tianbao era for the reception of the sacred talisman of the Numinous Treasure. The Emperor composed a eulogy, and Luochuan County was soon renamed Zhenning County. A Tongsheng Abbey was constructed at the site of the discovery, and the Emperor composed an inscription for its stele, which remains extant.

In the sixth month of the same year, a single stalk of jade fungus (*yuzhi*) emerged in the Great Harmony Hall. Furthermore, Li Hun of Mount Tai Bai reported a vision of the Primordial August Emperor, who revealed that a jade tablet inscribed with the Emperor’s fortune and longevity lay within the Golden Star Grotto. The imperial censor Wang Pi was dispatched into the Immortal’s Wandering Valley, where, after traveling over forty *li*, he obtained it. The extraordinary omen was proclaimed throughout the realm.

On the day *bingyin* of the intercalary sixth month, the Emperor visited the Great Clarity Palace, bestowed honorific titles upon the Five Sacred Ones, and commissioned statues of Confucius and his four disciples to stand in attendance before the Primordial August Emperor. Edicts were issued for the establishment of Jade Fungus Abbeys in the major prefectures of the ten circuits, and a general amnesty was proclaimed.

In the ninth year, on the day *gengyin*, Wang Yuanyi of Mount Tai Bai reported that the Primordial August Emperor had descended and revealed the presence of a wondrous treasure and true talisman within the Treasure Immortal Grotto. The Minister of Justice Zhang Jun and the Minister of Works Wang Chui were dispatched to retrieve it, and upon its acquisition, it was entrusted to the Historiography Institute.

*End of Scroll Five of the Youlong Chronicle*

**Scroll Six of the Youlong Chronicle**
*Compiled by Right Street Supervisor of the Abandoned Writ and Teaching Gate Affairs, Grand Master of Sublime Virtue and Perfected Truth, Jia Shanxiang*

**Under the Divine Ancestor of the Great Tang**

In the thirteenth year, on the day *jiawu* of the first month, the eighth day, the Primordial August One manifested at the Great Clarity Palace, riding upon purple-black [clouds]. He summoned Academician Li Qi for discourse and proclaimed the prolongation of the imperial destiny. Auspicious omens of white cranes and iridescent clouds arrived at the court.

On the day *guiyou* of the second month, the Emperor paid homage at the Great Clarity Palace. He further bestowed upon the Primordial August One the honorific title *Great Sage Ancestor, Supreme Dao of the Golden Portals, Primordial August Heavenly Sovereign*. The Five Sacred Ones each received additional honorifics. The Emperor himself was granted the title *Kaiyuan Heaven-and-Earth Great Treasure, Sagely Civil, Divine Martial, Verified Dao, Filial Virtue Emperor*. A general amnesty was proclaimed throughout the realm.

In the tenth year, the Emperor journeyed to Shu. The Primordial August One manifested beside the Black Waters of Sanquan in Hanzhong Prefecture. The Emperor performed rites of veneration and commanded that a stone likeness of the true countenance be carved at the site of the manifestation. Later, in Yichang County of Lizhou, atop a ridge, the Emperor witnessed the Primordial August One passing by on a white guard [beast], foretelling the suppression of [An] Lushan’s rebellion. By edict, the mountain was named White Guard Ridge, and a Spontaneous Abbey was established at the site of the manifestation. The site of the Sanquan manifestation lies six *li* south of Wangqin Post Station.

In the second year of the Zhide era, on the day *dingyou* of the third month, the eighteenth day, the Primordial August One manifested upon Yunlong Crag in Tonghua Prefecture. Earlier, the local populace had established a grand fast and assembly to pray for the state’s blessings. On the eighteenth day, suddenly, mist and strange fragrance arose, thick and lingering. By the *chen* hour, it gradually cleared, and divine radiance illuminated the heavens. Thereupon, the true image of the Primordial August One appeared before the mountain, stretching from earth to sky, clad entirely in white. His left hand hung down, while his right held a fan of the Five Luminances. His majestic bearing shone resplendent. The assembled multitude gazed in reverence. Though the mountain was lofty, it did not reach even to his elbow. After a long while, he vanished.

Thereupon, a memorial was submitted, and the imperial court produced an illustrated record. The Supreme August Emperor composed a eulogy and preface, which were compiled and entrusted to the court historians, then promulgated throughout the realm.

The preface states: Our Great Sacred Ancestor, in unfolding the manifold mysteries, illumined the Supreme Clarity. He bequeathed counsel to his descendants, repeatedly manifesting subtle aid. On the eighteenth day of the third month this year, he again appeared upon Yunlong Crag in Tonghua Prefecture. By day, his wondrous form emerged, suspended in auspicious hues—robed in the raiment of the Seven Luminaries and Five Radiance, attended by jade lads and golden maidens. Daoists, Buddhists, humans, and devas all made obeisance and gazed in reverence. In former times, the true transmission at Yangjiao ensured the imperial line’s boundless endurance. Now, his august presence shines upon Dragon’s Severity, and malevolent vapors shall soon disperse. Not only does this continue the transmission across generations, whereby former kings attained the One, but it also portends blessings for the ancestral temple and state, ensuring ten thousand generations of posterity. We command that this be depicted in refined colors and displayed throughout the prefectures and kingdoms. Gazing upon this image shall be as though standing beneath the vault of the sunlit heavens, or as though present in the court of the Supreme Ultimate.

The eulogy proclaims:
How wondrous our ancestral line,
Who revealed the teachings in due time.
Governing body and state alike,
They daily sought the rare and sublime.
Above, they opened the grottoes of immortals;
Below, they manifested their numinous form.
Illuminating the perfect Dao,
They sighed in praise of non-action.
The cliffs and valleys grew resplendent,
No detail lost in vermilion and azure.
Divine radiance blazed forth,
Auspicious light lingered long.
The court rejoiced in celebration,
All prefectures turned their thoughts here.
Blessings and prosperity flowed forth,
A thousand ages preserved in this moment.

On the twenty-sixth day of the sixth month of that year, the edict was proclaimed.

In the *jihai* year of Qianyuan (759 CE), the Emperor dreamed one night that two azure lads led him to a palace, where he was received in audience by the Primordial August One. Clad in robes of cloud and mist, crowned with a nine-phoenix diadem, he sat upon a square mat beneath a jeweled canopy, resting against a jade armrest and holding a white whisk. Attendants—Perfected Ones, jade maidens, immortals, lads, and celestial warriors from the five directions—stood in vast array. The Emperor, dressed in crimson robes and bearing a jade tablet, stood in attendance behind the Primordial August One. They traversed mountains and seas, journeying great distances, each step of which the Emperor secretly committed to memory. He also saw that the Primordial August One’s hair and beard were black. At dawn, he issued an edict ordering the two thoroughfares of the capital to seek out all auspicious images. At the Hall of the Sacred Ancestor in the Guangtian Abbey of Wuben Ward, they indeed found an image of the Elder Lord with a black beard. It was copied and presented to the throne. The Emperor, overjoyed, saw that it matched exactly what he had beheld in his dream. He then had his own true likeness produced and ordered it to stand in attendance behind the Primordial August One. This was promulgated throughout the realm, commanding universal veneration.

At the beginning of Emperor Daizong’s reign, eight treasures were unearthed in Anyi County of Chuzhou. The county was renamed Baoying, and a Baoying Abbey was established at the site of the discovery. The reign title was changed to Baoying, and a general amnesty was declared throughout the empire.

In the tenth year of Zhenyuan (794 CE) under Emperor Dezong, the Primordial August One secretly dispatched the Queen Mother of the West to descend repeatedly upon Jinquan Mountain in Guozhou. She transmitted the defense of refining blackness to the female Daoist Xie Ziran. After her cultivation was complete, on the sixteenth day of the tenth month of that year, she ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Three months later, she returned and said to Prefect Li Jian: “In heaven there is a Jade Hall, where the Most High Elder Lord resides. On its walls are inscribed the names of all the immortals, with annotations below stating whether they were emperors, ministers, or commoners in the human realm. When immortals come to pay their respects to the Elder Lord, all bow four times.” Having spoken, Xie Ziran ascended to heaven once more.

In the second year of Baoli (826 CE) under Emperor Jingzong, on the first month, the Emperor conducted the southern suburban sacrifices and reverently offered thanks at the Supreme Clarity Palace. As the imperial procession approached, Zheng Wen, the chief clerk of Chang’an County, suddenly saw the Elder Lord clad in white robes, his countenance extraordinary. He said to Zheng: “Here there is a well with a broken rim. Quickly fill it, or disaster shall strike without warning.” Startled, Zheng looked and saw that the ground had already begun to subside. He immediately mobilized workers to fill the well. By then, the Elder Lord had vanished. When the imperial procession arrived, Zheng reported all that had occurred, and the assembled officials offered their congratulations. An edict was issued commanding Wei Chuhou, Vice Minister of War, to compose an inscription, and Liu Gongquan, Gentleman for Court Audiences, to write the calligraphy. The stele was erected beside the filled well, and its account was compiled and entrusted to the court historians.

On the eighteenth day of the twelfth month of that year, as Liu Gongquan was inscribing the stele, a sudden gust of wind arose, swirling ceaselessly. Then the Primordial August One appeared, clad in purple robes, a golden crown, and golden slippers, standing upon a white lotus. His right hand held a fan of the Five Luminances, while his left hung down. A golden radiance filled the air. Liu and the stone carvers gazed upon him for a long while, then traced his form upon the ground. When the drawing was complete, the Primordial August One suddenly pointed his fan toward the sky. Streams of light scattered in all directions, and he ascended into the void. All present turned to watch, their bodies leaning back as he grew smaller and smaller, vanishing into the clouds. The matter was reported to the throne, and an edict ordered the events recorded upon the stele.

In the second year of Kaicheng of Emperor Wenzong’s reign, the cyclical year dingsi, fifth month, Gao Yuanyu, Vice Director of the Secretariat, serving as Prefect of Bazhou, suddenly beheld an unusual radiance upon the cliffs by the Jialing River, some eight or nine li north of the prefectural seat. Drawing near, he saw upon the stone natural veining that formed the true image of the Venerable Lord Lao: brows, hair, cap, and robes—shoes and garments—all perfectly complete. Beside him stood a figure in flowing robes and wide sleeves, holding a censer to offer incense. Behind was a youthful attendant, hair bound high in twin topknots, reverent as though awaiting command. None of these had been shaped by human hand, painting, or carving.

Whenever Yuanyu made prayers, purple-black vapors would rise above, and a numinous spring welled forth of its own accord. When local gentry and commoners sought blessings, all proved efficacious. Thereupon he had the stone inscribed and a hall built to mark this auspicious sign. He then had a painting made and presented to the throne. The matter was duly recorded in the histories, and the edict approved.

In the first year of Huichang of Emperor Wuzong’s reign, it was decreed that the fifteenth day of the second month—the birthday of the Great Saintly Ancestor—be established as the Descending Saint Festival. In both capitals and all prefectures and subprefectures throughout the realm, rites were to be held with fasting, Daoist observances, and music, and a grand amnesty granted for three days. Even in times of urgent military campaign, this was not to be suspended, and it was made a permanent institution.

In the tenth year of Emperor Yizong’s Gantong reign, the cyclical year jichou, ninth month, tenth day, the rebel leader Pang Xun of Xuzhou, leading over three thousand followers, invaded the Taiqing Palace in Bozhou. That day, more than three hundred officials and commoners in the north witnessed the Venerable Lord Lao riding the void southward from the palace. In an instant, black mist filled the southern valleys, causing the bandits to lose their way and slaughter one another. Pang Xun drowned in the waters. Li Wei, Military Commissioner of Bianzhou and Supervisor of the Taiqing Palace, reported the events in full.

The imperial edict proclaimed: “Our dynasty inherits its lineage from the Primordial August One; its teachings uphold purity and quiescence.”

The ancient village of Kuxian, the sacred homeland of the Primordial Ancestor, boasts palaces of solemn grandeur and temples duly established. In recent times, remnant rebels surged forth, setting fires and torching structures; dark mists shrouded the clear skies, and frenzied bandits lost their way upon the roads, scattering across the plains before their strongholds were razed to the ground. Reflecting upon the primordial merit, we now renew these numinous manifestations. An imperial rescript in blue has been issued, and Li Wei has been entrusted to reverently offer thanks and proclamations, which shall be disseminated throughout the realm and recorded by the court historians.

In the thirteenth year of the Gantong reign, cyclical year *renchen*, third month, Prefect Yao Hu of Taizhou memorialized that on Mount Tiantai, a Hall of the Venerable Lord Lao had been restored. There, a stone casket was unearthed, containing a sacred text, which was presented to the throne. The imperial edict proclaimed: “Heaven bestows its blessings, and Earth reveals its auspices. Behold, a divine scripture on white tablets has emerged from the Treasure Hall of the Primordial August One, portending the prolongation of the imperial destiny and serving as a celestial talisman to enlighten the earthly realm. In light of this extraordinary felicity, it shall be deemed a supreme omen, recorded in the Historiographer’s Office, and proclaimed to the four quarters.”

In the second year of the Guangming reign, cyclical year *xinchou*, third month, Military Commissioner Wang Chongrong of Hezhong reported that, according to a memorial from Jinzhou, on Mount Longjiao at the Qingtang Abbey beside the Hall of the Venerable Lord Lao, a wondrous vine of *ge* had withered and then revived upon a bridge’s timber. Previously, during the Wude reign, the Primordial August One had manifested, and a hall was later erected between two trees. The following year, a *ge* vine spontaneously sprouted upon a parasol tree, its tendrils extending over ten *zhang* in luxuriant growth. Later, when Prince Qi usurped the succession, the vine withered and died. Within ten days, however, fresh verdant shoots regrew from its tip, and Prince Qi was soon defeated. Thereafter, during the restoration of Emperor Zhongzong, the rebellions of An Lushan and Shi Siming, and the treachery of Zhu Ci, the vine repeatedly withered and revived. In the first year of the Guangming reign, when Huang Chao invaded the passes, the vine withered that autumn. In the second year, its branches and leaves flourished anew, and another vine sprouted from the soil beside the neighboring tree. Within ten days, it grew over fifty *chi* in length, its twin vines thriving in extraordinary abundance. The memorial was met with imperial praise, and the event was duly recorded by the court historians. These successive omens, all accompanied by imperial edicts, extol the myriad virtues of the *ge* vine, celebrating the flourishing of the imperial lineage and the far-reaching blessings of the Primordial August One, whose flowing power ensures an unbroken succession through the ages.

Emperor Xizong, then sojourning in western Shu, received the report in the second year of the Zhonghe reign, eighth month, day *jiachen*, and ordered its proclamation throughout the court and realm. On the day *renchen* of the third month, Prefect Pan Chou of Bozhou dispatched the Daoists Ma Hanzhang and Sun Bingwu to memorialize: Since the fourth year of the Qianning reign, the sacred precincts of Zhenyuan have repeatedly suffered incursions by rebel bands, numbering from over a thousand to tens of thousands. These marauders, coveting the Pure Palace, sought to burn and plunder it, attacking cities or raiding neighboring counties. Yet each time, the Venerable Lord Lao secretly extended his divine transformation: suddenly, dense clouds arose, or dark winds were driven forth, or thunder and hail struck down the invaders, who invariably stumbled and perished in defeat.

The numinous thus grew ever more manifest, its divine efficacy unfathomable. Soon thereafter, an imperial edict elevated Zhenyuan County to the status of a capital district. The emperor personally composed a *qingci* prayer, offering solemn thanksgiving, and immediately bowed in reverence toward the east. On the twelfth day of the eighth month, it was memorialized: The Great Clarity Palace of Bozhou is the very hamlet where the Primordial Lord descended and took human form—its name exalted as the ancestral home of the Dao, its blessings answering the imperial destiny. The Nine Dragons’ Auspicious Well brims with celestial essence, while the traces of the transcendent deer linger among the trees. The omens of successive generations, like the propitious patterns of a chessboard, are worthy of record, and in recent years, the responses of the divine have been especially resplendent. How fitting it is to honor and adorn this hallowed precinct; how could one allow its sacred precincts to fall into neglect? Prefect Pan Chou has governed with virtuous policies, long steeped in the true wind of the Dao. He has generously disbursed his official salary to restore the palaces and abbeys, ensuring that walls, ponds, beams, and rafters are all meticulously renewed. The painted and carved images, resplendent in cinnabar and jade, have been made even more radiant. Upon examining the illustrated records and reviewing the events, one finds profound cause for commendation. The presiding abbey’s ritual master, the Daoist Wu Chongyuan, shall be granted the purple robe and styled Master of Concentrated Reality. The Daoists Ma Hanzhang and Sun Bingwu shall likewise be granted the purple robe. Pan Chou shall be promoted to Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, Minister of Works, and Gold-and-Purple Grand Master for Assisting Governance, while his other titles remain unchanged.

On the night of the twenty-ninth day of the eighth month, the cyclical day *wuchen*, the imperial clansman Li Teli and the Daoist Li Wuwei, at the Green Ram Market’s Yuanzhong Abbey in Chengdu—the old site where the Primordial Lord descended—held a jiao offering to invoke the perfected. Suddenly, they beheld a red light, about the size of a pellet, gradually growing brighter and larger. It emerged from the bamboo grove southeast of the temple foundation, leapt and bounded into the plum thicket west of the hall. There, it penetrated the earth to a depth of three feet, revealing a precious scroll. The scroll measured one foot, one inch, and five fen in length; seven inches and four fen in width. One side was one inch and three fen thick, adorned with floral patterns; the other side was one inch and eight fen thick, weighing twelve jin. Upon it were six characters in ancient seal script, each two inches square and three fen deep, their engravings lustrous and pristine, far beyond human craftsmanship. The inscription read: *Tai Shang yi ping Zhonghe zai* (The Supreme One has already pacified the calamities of the Zhonghe era).

On the cyclical day *gengchen* of the ninth month, Chen Jingxuan, Military Commissioner of Xichuan and Grand Preceptor, memorialized: The Emperor, venerating antiquity and aligning with Heaven, has received the mandate to govern and guide the realm. His heart is fixed upon the supreme Dao, his aspirations set upon great harmony. Thus, he has toured the provinces to demonstrate his acknowledgment of faults, his profound benevolence extending to the lands below, his perfect virtue ascending to the heavens above. Prophetic omens have duly arrived, auspicious signs have repeatedly appeared. The Supreme One has bestowed a mandate of preservation, quelling the scourge of rebels and calamities in the Zhonghe era. Now, a luminous inscription has manifested in ancient seal script, fully attesting that malevolent influences shall soon be extinguished, the sacred destiny shall know no bounds, the time of recovery is nigh, and the day of peace and tranquility is at hand. The edict was proclaimed to all officials.

The Vice Director of the Chancellery and Grand Councilor Wei Zhaodu, the Vice Minister of Revenue and Grand Councilor Xiao Gu, the Vice Director of the Secretariat and Grand Councilor Zheng Tian, the Censor-in-Chief Zhang Zhi, and the Minister of the Imperial Clan and Heir to Prince Cao, Gui Nian, jointly submitted a memorial of congratulation: We humbly observe that when bandits gather and howl like jackals, the imperial carriage tours the provinces; when celestial disasters strike, they have occurred in every dynasty. Your Majesty has issued an edict of self-reproach in the manner of Cheng Tang, verifying the punitive expeditions of a true sovereign. Behold those malevolent portents—they shall soon be annihilated. The signs of peace and clarity have already manifested in the omens, and the hidden auguries have now revealed their secret script. The red bird bearing a book cannot compare to the Supreme One’s revelation, nor can the black tortoise bearing the hexagrams match the blessing of pacifying calamities. Moreover, on the occasion of the imperial clansman’s jiao offering, a propitious light leapt and bounded—a response so clear and emphatic. Furthermore, the Director of the Bureau of Military Affairs, Li Shunrong, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Ten Armies and Two Guards, Tian Lingzi, jointly submitted a memorial of congratulation: Now, from the imperial domain comes news of a transcendent abbey. As soon as the utmost sincerity was expressed, an auspicious sign swiftly appeared. The red light seen upon the earth today is the very same purple radiance that once accompanied the crossing of the pass. Upon excavating the accumulated soil, an ancient inscription was indeed uncovered. Its strokes, swift as dragons and serpents, foretell the pacification of the rebel strongholds. Emerging from the profound depths, its meaning is abundantly clear.

The Supreme Lord has now equaled the pacification of disasters, foretelling the eternal flourishing of the precious mandate. The manifestations all stem from the Sacred Ancestor, and the excavation was made by the imperial lineage. Holding these numinous traces, we may clearly discern the will of Heaven.

Moreover, the Primordial Sacred Ancestor, whenever encountering great calamities, has always shown extraordinary omens. These luminous proofs are fully recorded in the standard histories. Formerly, at the Vermilion Phoenix Gate, he revealed to Tian Tongxiu the time of the restoration of the Tianbao era. Now, in the Green Ram Market, he has shown himself to Li Teli, presaging the joy of Your Majesty’s return to the palace. Is this not the greatest fortune for the realm? It is requested that this be submitted to the Historiography Office.

The edict approved the request.

On the fifteenth day, Li Teli was appointed Collator of Texts to the Crown Prince, and Li Wuwei was granted the purple robe, each additionally bestowed with two hundred bolts of fine silk.

On the twenty-first day, another edict proclaimed: The Supreme Lord of the Primordial Dao and his disciple, Master Wen Shi, expounded the true scriptures upon the terrace of Louguan, pledging a later reunion at the Green Ram Market. Then, bearing the numinous chariot, they both entered the Flowing Sands. These accounts are transmitted in immortal records and marked upon terrestrial maps. From the time of King Zhao of Zhou until this day, spanning over two thousand years, the scene has been desolate, their traces sparse. Now, during the imperial progress, the numinous has become manifestly clear: an extraordinary light leapt and bounded before the courtyard, and divine talismans unfolded beneath the grove. Rich with ancient hues, the characters confirmed auspicious omens—the disasters of the era of harmony are about to be pacified, and the numinous talismans of the vast earth have appeared. This fully demonstrates that the vault of Heaven bestows its protection, the Sacred Ancestor confers his favor, the weapons of the great bandits will be annihilated, and the enterprise of the grand restoration will shine eternally. It must be transmitted in the annals and proclaimed throughout the realm. It has already been entrusted to the historiographers for compilation. Furthermore, the text shall be engraved and disseminated to all circuits and military fronts.

The abbey may be named the Green Ram Palace, and halls and chambers shall be established therein. The adjacent lands belonging to the abbey, approximately two *qing* in area, have hitherto been scattered among the common folk, mostly planted with perilla and sorghum. Such a pure and void terrain should not be subjected to such profane cultivation. Three hundred strings of cash have been granted to redeem these lands, and official deeds shall be issued to permanently attach them to the abbey.

The imperial clansman Teli has already been promoted, and the Daoist Li Wuwei has been granted the purple robe. Such fitting rewards express gratitude for the numinous favor. Reverently, let the highest ranks be bestowed, and let the public offices act with swift dignity. As the commanderies and states offer their allegiance in this era of extended prosperity, and as hearts are cultivated in the land of the Dao and virtue, the realm shall see the dissolution of arms and the earth yield its treasures. Such excellence is doubly worthy of praise.

On the seventh day of the tenth month, the high-ranking official Guo Xuntai was appointed to supervise the construction of the Green Ram Palace, with all labor and materials supplied by the Inner Treasury.

Since the discovery of the numinous omen, by the *guichou* day of this month, the nearby bandits have been successively captured and executed. Within a fortnight, the realm has attained peace. The imperial carriage visited the Green Ram Palace, and bestowals were distributed accordingly. Li Teli was granted the title of *Fei* and appointed Recorder of Longzhou. Another edict was issued:

The Supreme Lord has bestowed his auspicious sign, and the Green Ram has manifested its response. The rites must be reverently adorned to reciprocate this extraordinary favor. The Purple Ultimate Palaces in all circuits, prefectures, and commanderies shall be entrusted to the local governors for appropriate renovation, and Daoist priests skilled in liturgy shall be selected to perform the jiao offerings.

On the *yimao* day of this month, it was reported that the capital had been recovered. Herein we see that the Great Dao confers its favor, the Sacred Ancestor manifests his protection, the grand design endures eternally, and the Tang mandate knows no bounds.

Furthermore, the Hanlin Academician, Minister of War, and Drafter of Edicts, Yue Penggui, was commissioned to compose the stele inscription.

**Emperor Zhenzong’s Pilgrimage to the Ancient Site**

Those who governed the realm in antiquity, though their methods differed, shared the same aim; though they did not act with benevolence, they achieved benevolence. Thus they were as one.

When the Zhou held the realm, they paired Hou Ji with the offerings at the Circular Mound. When the Han held the realm, they established the Bamboo Palace to sacrifice to the Great Unity. Later generations inherited these as enduring customs, all expressing the intent to repay the root.

I have heard that Emperor Zhenzong, inheriting the legacy of the Great Ancestor and the Grand Ancestor—who responded to Heaven and followed the people to expand the frontiers of their illustrious enterprise—brought peace to the realm. Relying on the scholar-officials as his pillars, he laid down arms and cultivated culture, pacifying the people and enriching the state. He promoted ritual and music, elevated the worthy, so that even the eras of Cheng and Kang, Wen and Jing, were not his equal.

The achievements of emperors and kings are not the strategies of a single scholar; the talents of court and temple are not the branches of a single tree. How could these be empty words? Thus he surpassed Yao and Yi, maintained abundance and preserved success, becoming the true sovereign of great peace and pure tranquility.

The realm abounded in wealth and resources, the people dwelled in contentment, customs were joyful, the nine translations presented their tribute via ladders and boats, and the four borders knew no disturbance of metal and leather. This fulfilled the *Tai* hexagram of the *Great Change*: above and below interacted, their aspirations aligned.

Arms and armor serve to quell disorder; punishments serve to restrain violence. Yet in the time of Qin, when disorder was already settled and violence already extinguished, how could one rely on arms and armor? The *Xiaxi* states: "Things intermingle, hence the name *wen* (culture)." Thus, in the time of Qin, culture and enlightenment should have been employed to bring it to an end. Why? For when yin dwells externally and yang guards internally, they do not intermingle, and without intermingling, there is *pi* (stagnation). Therefore, the sage transformed the ninth yang into softness to intermingle with the hard, and changed the sixth yin into hardness to intermingle with the soft. Only then did the image of *wen* become manifest. Thus the image of *Bi* says: "The soft comes to adorn the hard, the hard ascends to adorn the soft." This is the meaning.

Moreover, in peace one does not forget danger; in prosperity one does not forget adversity. This is why the sage, proceeding from *Tai*, transforms into *Bi*—*Bi* being the image of culture and enlightenment. Governance takes education as its root and ritual and music as its instruments. Thus one cultivates culture in the family, in the state, and throughout the realm. The cultural transformation of humanity is achieved through this Way.

Yet the sage did not forget the assistance of the Three Spirits and sought to repay the root. Thus he sealed the eastern peak of Mount Tai and sacrificed at the western altar of Fenyin, manifesting his reverence for the gods and spirits and drawing near to the myriad states. Moreover, among the methods for governing the realm, none surpasses the Way of venerating the sages—simple, easy, pure, tranquil, and non-action. Therefore, he commanded his carriage to journey to the banks of the Wo River in Jingbo, to pay homage at the shrine below. The governors and officials of the commanderies hastened to the imperial presence as if attending the Four Mountains in audience.

Those of the scholar-official class who gazed upon the imperial countenance readied their servants, carriages, and horses, their hubs nearly colliding. As for traveling merchants and seated traders, farmers and rustic women, all—supporting the aged and leading the young—raised their voices in acclamation along the roadside, their harmonious cries resounding near and far. The imperial carriage arrived at Weizhen, where the emperor lodged in the temporary palace. Ascending the Wondrous View Pavilion, he gazed afar to offer prayers to the Great Purity.

At dawn, the emperor proceeded to the palace, where, after completing the court audience rites, he proceeded to the True Lord’s Hall. There, the True Lord manifested above the incense table. That evening, the emperor composed an inscription, which was carved upon the jade-green stele.

To the north of the Hall of Emptiness and Non-Being stood a great cypress, its branches extending to the eaves beneath the pillars. Once, when repairs were being made to the hall, it was proposed that the tree be felled. That night, a violent thunderstorm raged until dawn, and the cypress’s branches turned to point north. The Perfected August One halted his procession to observe it for some time. The so-called "imperially cherished cypress" referred to this tree. Lin Jiong of Futang inscribed a poem:

*"Men asked why the axe was stayed—*
*Heaven sent wind and thunder to turn its boughs."*
All took this as a record of fact and a manifestation of principle.

Later, a man from Anlu presented a white deer as an auspicious omen of the times. The emperor bestowed rich gifts upon him before sending him away.

This was the seventh year of the Xiangfu era.

**Imperially Composed "Ode on the Imperial Visit to the Supreme Clarity Palace" with Preface**

Of that which preceded the Two Modes and gave birth to the ten thousand things—this is called the Ultimate Dao.
Of that which first established the Three Spirits and unfolded the primordial mandate—this is called the Lofty Heaven.

Now, to dwell in the greatness of the Dao and exalt the sublimity of Heaven, to abide within bounds yet remain beyond measure, to surpass the workings of the potter’s wheel yet defy description—
Its response to the times is non-action that accomplishes all.
Its hidden radiance is non-going that reaches everywhere.

Thus, it preserves numinous traces and sets divine journeys in motion, now arriving in indistinct union, now treading loftily in profound obscurity.
It dwells in revelry among the Ninefold Clarities, sharing equal honor with the Primordial Beginning.
For a hundred million ages, it is gazed upon in reverence, hailed as the Most High and the fount of boundless grace.

Of this, the Venerable Master Lao was the very embodiment.
Through him, the vast expanse knew no corner untouched by his beneficence; the luminous precincts of the blessed realms became the birthplace of the August Emperor’s sacred advent.
Resplendent was the immortal shrine, the very domain where divine radiance blazes forth.
Rightly, then, did the accumulation of essence turn toward him, and the seeking of great blessings find its answer. In accord with the people’s longing and the propitious moment, he was revered with awe.

The Supreme Clarity Palace stood amid the lands of Qiao Prefecture, beside the vast abyss of the Wo River, a famed site of sagely descent and a tranquil hall for the assembly of Perfected Ones.
Within the domain of Cheng Tang’s kingdom, its borders stretched far; near the ruins of Tai Hao’s ancient capital, its precincts lay close at hand. The land was pure and steadfast, its soil rich and fertile.
Lofty mounds and layered ridges commanded the terrain for a thousand *li*; luxuriant forests and noble trees displayed their verdant splendor through all four seasons.
Truly, it was a fitting sanctuary for the secluded and a dwelling for the transcendent.

Thus, the Most High Lord Lao, the August Emperor of Primordial Virtue, received the dark essence of the primordial chaos and contained the subtle essence of the profound obscurity. Emerging from the boundless transformation, he crowned all living things as their origin.
He existed before the Great Ultimate and was born from it; he preceded the compilation of the *Yi* and yet endured beyond it.
When he was conceived in response to a star, his clan was discerned by the name Li; he spoke at birth and bore a hoary head before he could crawl—these were the signs of his supreme numinosity.
He withdrew to the pillar’s shadow, journeyed far to the shifting sands, answered Confucius with ritual propriety, and transmitted the scriptures to Yin Xi—these were the near manifestations of his teachings.
From the eras of Fu Xi and Tai Hao through the Shang and Zhou dynasties, he appeared in each age as a Perfected One, his wondrous traces enduring through the generations—this was the virtue of his divine transformations.
He rode the wind and drove the clouds, journeyed to the Pure Capital of the Nine Heavens, governed the host of immortals, and proclaimed the harmony of *qi*—these were the accomplishments of his shaping and completion.

Of his teachings, the subtle and formless were the essence; the pure and tranquil were the foundation. Rooted in spontaneity, they attained the utmost subtlety.
Applied to governance, they harmonized with the Great Mean; applied to self-cultivation, they led to agelessness. Extended to the world, they could restore its pristine simplicity; bestowed upon the people, they brought them enduring blessings.
He was the ancestor of all things and the forerunner of all teachings.

The Han dynasty esteemed his words and reduced its penal codes.
The Tang venerated his Dao and ushered in an era of peace.
Rightly, then, did his teachings spread far and wide, transmitted for a hundred million years without end.

Our dynasty received the precious mandate of everlasting succession and inaugurated a legacy of accumulated splendor. The foundation of pure governance began with this wondrous Dao.
The August Ancestor, Emperor Taizu, was divinely martial yet spurned killing, wielding shield and battle-axe to bring the Nine Regions into submission.
The August Ancestor, Emperor Taizong, embodied clarity and brilliance, ruling with ease to propagate the Five Teachings.
Their cultivated virtues surpassed the glorious reputations of all sovereigns; their resplendent numinosity inspired the reverence of even the humblest subjects.

How could I not treasure frugality and moderation, uphold reverent silence, follow the teachings of the *Five Thousand Characters*, and bring peace to the myriad people?
Wherever the tracks of carts extend, may all ascend to benevolence and longevity; wherever the sun and moon shine, may all be bathed in harmonious clarity.
Through the resonance of utmost sincerity, auspicious signs have indeed manifested.

When the divine moment arrived and propitious omens were proclaimed, the grand rites were completed, and pure blessings converged.
The chariots of the Nine Heavens descended to the imperial chambers; the felicitous portents of a hundred generations were heard in the imperial lineage.
In reverent response to the bestowed blessings and in humble gratitude for the descent of peace, it was fitting to select an auspicious site in the sacred land and offer great thanksgiving in the spring season.

I reflected upon the Father of the Supreme Teaching, who first manifested wondrous efficacy in the Three Powers.
In the outskirts of illustrious Bo, the numinous precinct of the Nine Wells stood tall.
As I personally prepared to pay homage, I sought counsel on the matter.
The people’s offerings and their words swiftly took shape in my aspirations.
Moved by this harmony, I deeply comforted my heart.

Thus, it was decided to undertake the imperial progress to fulfill the people’s desires. Thereupon, I issued a luminous edict, and the officials selected the propitious moment in the first month of the year. I journeyed to the sacred court in the left of Qiao Prefecture.

With a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, with ninefold processions and eightfold regalia, I reined in my steeds along the imperial thoroughfare and spread my canopy over the halls of the Perfected Ones.
The attendants performed their duties, and the myriad states filled the court.
Beforehand, I purified my heart, adhering to the precepts of the fast.
At dawn, I offered libations, striving to embody the reverence of one who feels the presence of the divine.
Bells and chimes harmonized with the purity of the ritual vessels.
I presented the precious tablets to exalt his sacred name and ascended the altar to await the descent of the numinous presence.

Amid the vastness of the starry heavens and the solemnity of the palace halls, I yearned for the arrival of the august spirit and imagined the Penglai Isles drawing near.
The grand ceremony proceeded without flaw, and the blessings were abundantly bestowed.

Thereafter, I proceeded to the Grand Temple, took my place at the southern altar, presented the jade tablets and silks, offered the sacrificial animals and libations, ascended to pay homage to the ancestors, and joined in the worship of the boundless heavens.
Thus, I perfected the pure virtue of the state and answered the vast blessings of the gods and spirits.

Though my person is humble, I have been entrusted with the sagely legacy. Reverently bearing the sacred words and solemnly following the mysteries of the Dao, I dare not indulge in esoteric arts or seek immortality.
Rather, I venerate the subtle and formless, transforming the realm, longing to emulate the pristine antiquity and greatly shelter the people.
The Six Ancestral Temples have bestowed their favor; the Three Spirits have flowed their grace.
Thus, I have received Heaven’s gifts and shared in the joy of the divine. The ceremonies of a bygone age have been repeatedly performed, and the resplendent affairs have been made manifest in all their brilliance.
The fasting and dwelling in the Upper Harmony Palace were completed, and the reverent bows at Mount Dong were fulfilled.

Having followed the Dao to propagate transformation, I further esteemed virtue to instruct the people.
The imperial procession returned in solemnity, and upon surveying the ceremonial vessels, I beheld their splendor—jade and precious stones arrayed in abundance, while the winds of moral influence remained unchanging.

**Eulogy:**
The land of Qiaodu,
The guest of the Guo River—
Here lies the blessed realm.
The August One, born of sagely truth,
Embodies all subtleties,
Bestowing grace upon the multitudes.
In the hidden chamber, the Dao was sought;
Confucius leaned upon benevolence;
At Hangu Pass, the qi was observed.
Yin Xi knew the divine—
Though his carriage’s chant has long since passed,
The vast response remains ever new.
This blessed land endures,
Its moral legacy boundless—
Gazing afar at the reverent halls.
Bowing to the people’s will,
With feathered banners yearning to pay homage,
Ancient rites were reverently upheld.
Incense and offerings were solemnly presented,
Pure devotion earnestly expressed.
Examining the resounding brilliance—now fully prepared—
I hoped for mutual resonance in luminous response.
Praying that the august power remain undimmed,
I longed for blessings to follow in succession.
To proclaim and propagate these flourishing principles,
I briefly inscribed them in enduring stone.
The sequence solidifies the pillars—three cypresses,
Illuminating surpassing virtue for ten thousand springs.
Thus concludes the sixth scroll of *The Transmission of the Dragon’s Teachings*.
