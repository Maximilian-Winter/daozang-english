**Register of Elevated Titles for the Perfected Lord Zhenwu, Numinous and Responsive, Supreme Protector of the Sagely**

In the second year of the Daguan reign, cyclical year *wuzǐ*, third month, first day *xīnhài*, twenty-fourth day *jiǎxū*, the Emperor respectfully bows twice and declares:

Of the August Thearch on High, who nurtures and protects the people below,
Who governs and guards the northern quarter, there is a great divine general.
Utterly true in manifestation, responsive through karmic resonance,
His profound virtue and hidden merit sustain the myriad states.

We reverently consider the Perfected Lord Zhenwu, Numinous and Responsive:
Aligning with the *Xu* and *Wei* constellations, uniting the forms of tortoise and serpent,
His Dao and virtue are wondrous beyond naming, his awe-inspiring numen pervades the ten thousand existents.
Traversing the six directions, he discerns the formless,
Blessing the good and punishing the licentious, sheltering all living things.

Our dynasty, receiving the precious mandate, has endured for one hundred and fifty years.
Now extending to our humble self, we inherit this grand legacy.
What we desire, we unfailingly attain; what we undertake, we unfailingly accomplish.
Divinity and humanity rest in peace; the seas and lands are tranquil.
No malevolent omens arise; auspicious signs repeatedly arrive.
The prosperity of Great Peace flourishes in the abundance of *qi*.
Without the divine one’s abundant guidance, how could we reach this state?

It is fitting to advance his illustrious titles, thereby manifesting our luminous gratitude.

We reverently dispatch Chao Sanlang, Probationary Minister of Personnel concurrently serving as Reader-in-Waiting and Compiler of the Veritable Records, bestowed with the Purple Gold Fish Bag, Yu Shen, to present the ceremonial document elevating the august title to: "Protective Sage Perfected Warrior Numinous-Responsive Perfected Lord."

For those who hold the registers of destiny, the rites of the divine heavens are indeed canonical. Leading the people in reverence, nothing surpasses the exaltation of ritual. When devotion dwells within, it is fitting to express it through ceremonial form. May he deign to look upon us with favor and bestow blessings and felicity.

Respectfully proclaimed.
The ceremonial document for the elevation of the title of Perfected Warrior Numinous-Responsive Perfected Lord to "Protective Sage" is hereby concluded.
