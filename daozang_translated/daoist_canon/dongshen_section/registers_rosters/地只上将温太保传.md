Marshal Wen was loyal and upright. After becoming a mountain spirit, he eternally safeguarded the incense and offerings of the Mysterious Emperor. The Emperor of the Eastern Peak commended him.

One day, the Northern Emperor bestowed a thousand pellets of plague medicine upon the Eastern Peak, sternly commanding that envoys be dispatched to spread pestilence, inspecting the world to punish those who were disloyal, unfilial, killed living beings, or harmed creatures. The Emperor of the Eastern Peak received the decree and summoned Wen to spread the plague.

Wen accepted the medicine and pondered repeatedly. A single pellet could kill a thousand people, and the deaths of a thousand would bring calamity to a thousand households. Moreover, as the qi of the season circulated, the poison would spread illness, and the residual misfortune would afflict countless others. This greatly violated the Supreme’s virtue of cherishing life. "It would be better," he thought, "for me to sacrifice myself to save a thousand lives. What regret could there be?" He then faced the heavens, turned north, and swallowed all the pellets in one gulp.

Soon after, his abdomen ached and his body burned with fever, unbearable to endure. He burned incense and went straight to the Emperor of the Eastern Peak, transforming into a great ferocious ghost. He reported the matter and prostrated himself, awaiting punishment. Just then, the Northern Emperor urgently dispatched an order to supervise the inspection. The Emperor of the Eastern Peak had no choice but to truthfully report Wen’s dereliction of duty to the Northern Emperor, who then sent him to the Right Victory Court for reprimand.

The Mysterious Emperor praised Wen’s intentions and petitioned on his behalf, begging for his pardon. The Northern Emperor granted the request, exhorting Wen to serve exclusively under the Mysterious Emperor’s command, spreading transformation and executing demons. From then on, his mighty reputation grew even greater.

Later, Wen saw Cao Kefu of the Jade Numinous Palace, who from childhood had practiced the secret methods of earth deities. Once, while performing transformations in Chiyang, there was a Five Manifestations Temple in the prefecture, renowned for its numinous efficacy, with magnificent halls. An accompanying official was assigned to take charge of it. Initially, he brought his family to pay respects at the temple. His concubine entered the hall with him to observe, but upon returning, she fell into a stupor, and no medicine could revive her. Her limbs stiffened, and she was placed in a coffin, not yet encoffined.

The officials said, "There is a Daoist priest named Cao in the market whose talismanic arts are highly efficacious." The accompanying official sent for him. Upon arrival, Cao examined the situation and said, "It is a pity that a day has passed; she cannot be revived. However, if you wish to investigate, we can determine if it was the work of an evil spirit." The official agreed.

Cao wrote talismans and performed rituals, burning them beside the coffin. In an instant, the coffin lid lifted on its own, and the corpse leapt out, standing before Cao and making a choking sound. Cao said, "This is the malevolent ghost that has possessed the corpse. Do not be alarmed. Let me interrogate it."

After repeated torture, the ghost finally confessed, "I am the fourth deity of the Five Kings Temple of this prefecture, Flower Radiance Concealing Bodhisattva." Cao asked why it had seized the soul of a living person. The ghost replied, "When the deceased entered the temple to observe, she thought to herself, ‘How could there be such a fine man in the world?’ Seeing her arise in vain desire, I seized her soul."

Cao ordered the ghost to release her. The deity said, "Though the ritual master’s command cannot be disobeyed, the breath has already ceased, and nothing can be done." Enraged, Cao declared he would petition the Celestial Emperor to destroy the deity’s form. The deity replied, "I am formed from the essence of the Five Peaks and Four Streams, the finest qi of mountains and rivers. I am not like other spirits. The ritual master can only sever the incense offerings of Chizhou to me." With that, the corpse returned to the coffin as before.

Cao ordered the coffin sealed and chose an auspicious day to report to the Celestial Emperor, dispatching Wen to execute the deity. He then informed the accompanying official, who had all the clay statues transported and destroyed in the training grounds. Only when the fourth statue was struck did blood flow. From then on, the incense offerings of Chizhou ceased.

Cao’s reputation soared because of this. Thereafter, he led the jade palaces, never acting recklessly, and his actions were always efficacious. It was all due to Marshal Wen.

Elsewhere, in a county near the Shu border, there was a spirit shrine of great numinous renown, repeatedly granted imperial titles, capable of bringing fortune or misfortune. Its inner chamber was deeply secluded, and no one was permitted to enter; those who tried were invariably afflicted by the deity. When the magistrate first arrived, he was already suspicious. Later, when his family fell ill, all blamed this deity.

One day, under the pretext of another matter, he ordered the patrol officer to lead archers to the temple. Dressed in full ceremonial attire, he performed sacrifices and composed a proclamation to admonish the deity. He then broke open the inner chamber’s door and led his men to force their way in. They saw an enormous monkey, which in its haste could not transform. The magistrate ordered the archers to shoot it dead, and the temple was burned.

The magistrate governed well for three years before departing with his family. On the journey home, they rested at an inn. While the magistrate was using the latrine, he suddenly saw a procession on the road, grandly escorting a deity. When he saw the deity being welcomed, it bore the same appearance as the monkey he had shot in the temple. The deity alighted from its sedan, spoke in human language, and sat with a sword, ordering its attendants to seize the magistrate. It then commanded a ghostly servant to devour him.

As the magistrate was being seized, someone intervened, saying, "There is no need to devour him. Please, Great King, go to his home and take charge." The ghostly servant then hurled the magistrate into the air, and he suddenly found himself in a desolate wilderness, not knowing where he was.

After searching for several days, he finally encountered people and asked where he was. They said he was over five thousand *li* from home. Day and night, he begged for directions to return but could not find the way. He only heard of Longhu Mountain in Xinzhou and wished to seek the Celestial Master. With this single thought, true numinous protection preserved his life.

After more than four years, he finally reached Xinzhou but had not yet entered the mountain when he saw a Daoist priest. Upon inquiry, the priest said, "I am Master Xuqing."

The magistrate knelt and bowed deeply, about to recount his ordeal, when Master Xuqing said, "I already know all. There is no need to go to the mountain. How have you sustained yourself on the road, sir?" He replied, "I have only been practicing fate-calculation." Master Xuqing then bestowed upon him a mirror and a talisman—one to hang over his heart, the other to bind upon his left arm—and instructed him to depart. The magistrate hastened on his way, as if shielded by unseen forces, covering over a hundred *li* a day without fatigue. In barely a year, he suddenly found himself in his hometown, as though guided by an invisible hand to his door. Upon arrival, he followed Master Xuqing’s instructions precisely, still claiming to make his living by fate-calculation. When his household—elders and children alike—came to observe his divination, the magistrate spoke with them. Suddenly, the mirror trembled. He struck it with the talisman he had been given, and from the mirror leapt General Wen, accompanied by thunder, lightning, and swirling black mist and wind, a sight too terrible to behold. After a long while, the storm cleared, revealing the slain body of a giant monkey and two smaller ones before the hall. The magistrate explained what had transpired, and only then did his family recall the events. The two smaller monkeys had been born to his wife and concubine, though their names could not be remembered.

Years later, Lu Yanghao arrived in Jiangxi and, while performing miracles in Linjiang Prefecture, encountered the Xiao family, who were suffering from a malignant affliction and had posted rewards seeking a cure. Lu took up residence near Huili Temple. Each time he possessed a child, the child would leap into the Moon Pavilion’s waters and not resurface, leaving the crowd in doubt. Lu then possessed another person, who seized the ritual sword held by the officiating priest and likewise plunged into the pool. After a long while, the three emerged carrying a single fish head ashore, revealing it as the source of the Xiao family’s torment. Thus, the affliction was cured. Lu remarked to others, "Only when General Wen was dispatched did the illness swiftly abate."

Hong Yian, a renowned Daoist of the Neitai School in Dengzhou, traveled with his disciple Zhong Yeyun to Jianning Prefecture. At the home of Huang Tongyao in Pucheng County’s Niutian, they encountered his young daughter, who was possessed by a malevolent spirit. Through spirit possession, they discerned that while serving in Min, the girl had been afflicted by two demons—one named Jiang Lang, the other called Dai Dapo. The demons were imprisoned in a temple, but someone had broken the seals. The spirits fled, enlisting the aid of other wicked deities, transforming into crows and tigers that circled the temple, roaring and shrieking. No ritual could subdue them until the Ten Earth Deities’ method was employed, capturing them all. The demons were then bound and taken across the lake, where a drowning ritual erased their forms. Thus, it became clear how the Earth Deities’ authority and General Wen’s swift efficacy worked in such cases.

Here, I have gathered these accounts to supplement omissions in earlier records. *Supplement to the Biography of General Wen the Pacifier of Demons* concludes.
