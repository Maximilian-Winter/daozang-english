**Record of the Great Purification Grotto-Heaven**

*Scripture Title:* *Record of the Great Purification Grotto-Heaven*. Composed by Deng Mu during the late Song and early Yuan dynasties. Three juan. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Grotto-Spirit Division*, *Genealogical and Recorded Works Section*.

**Preface to the Record of the Great Purification Grotto-Heaven**

As a prefecture, its mountains and rivers are majestic and elegant, unmatched in the southeast—thus making it a profound sanctuary of our Dao. The so-called "grotto-heavens and blessed lands" are found everywhere here. Passing through the lands above Qiantang, I often lingered in admiration, unable to depart, regretting only that I could not visit all its renowned sites. Upon reading *The Return-to-Oneness Regulations of Hangzhou’s Dongxiao Palace*, prefaced by my friend, Master Xu Dazhang, I grew even more enamored of its splendid landscapes and grand palaces, though I had yet to visit them.

This spring, a Daoist of the palace, whose name escapes me, presented its gazetteer and requested a preface. Through this, I explored its origins and history in detail, learning that the Celestial Pillar Peak of the Great Purification Grotto-Heaven is none other than Dongxiao Palace itself. Its history began in the *Yuanfeng* era of Emperor Wu of Han, and since the Jin and Tang dynasties, practitioners of self-cultivation and recluses have dwelled here. By the time of the Southern Song, when the capital was established in Hangzhou, its prominence in lineage, prestige, and renown equaled that of the Jade Clarity, Sweet Spring, Venerable Blessing, Radiant Response, Great Liquid, and Treasured Record Palaces and Observatories. The imperial favor it received—edicts of honor, imperial visits, grants of land, and bestowed plaques—was unparalleled in its time, surpassing even the splendor of the Yuan dynasty. Eminent figures and extraordinary scholars emerged in succession, invigorating the teachings. Though the palace halls have undergone changes—some ravaged by war or burdened by heavy taxes—regulations were later established to preserve its legacy, and signs of revival have gradually appeared.

The mountains and rivers here are esteemed as exceptional among grotto-heavens and blessed lands, and to this day, they are celebrated far and wide. Thus, the records of its grand halls, extraordinary figures, and magnificent writings are all meticulously preserved. For those seeking the finest in the southeast, what more could one desire?

The earlier gazetteers on this subject may be said to have faithfully chronicled its affairs and magnified its legacy. Now, this Daoist seeks to expand its publication, surely intending to carry forward the aspirations of his predecessors.

Alas! The rise and fall, prosperity and decline of past and present are endless. Even the traces of transcendent spirits and wondrous transformations may fade into obscurity, leaving no means of verification. What can be traced and explored relies solely on the enduring words of great writers, inscribed in metal and stone, shining brightly for a thousand years without fading.

Yet, while Zhejiang’s landscapes are sublime and its people outstanding, and while its jade palaces and jasper halls are renowned in their time, how many can truly entrust their legacy to imperishable words? Dongxiao’s fame in its era, its writings destined for immortality—if its transmission endures into the distant future, circulating alongside the books of the Three Mountains, would this not be a grand testament to our Dao?

Thus, I commend his aspirations and offer this preface.

Composed in the thirty-first year of the Hongwu reign, the year *wuyin*, on the full moon of the first month, by Zhang Yu Chu, the forty-third Heavenly Master, Lineage Holder of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, Illuminating Ancestor of the Dao of Non-Action, and Overseer of Daoist Affairs.

In the summer of the ninth year of the *Dade* era, I was dispatched by imperial decree to seek worthy individuals. I learned that Ye Tengwen and Deng Mu had secluded themselves on Celestial Pillar Mountain in Yuhang. Upon visiting, they firmly declined official service, allowing me to fully appreciate the mountain’s extraordinary and unparalleled vistas. Six years later, while traveling south on a sacrificial mission, Daoist Meng Jixu presented his compilation, *Illustrated Record of Dongxiao*, which documented the marvels of its mountains and rivers, the profound depths of its grottoes, the evolution of its palaces, and the exceptional figures who dwelled there. What I had not previously seen or heard was now laid bare before me. Once this work circulates in the world, Jixu’s contributions to this mountain will be truly commendable. Moreover, his virtue is profound, his writings serene and unassuming.

Master Shen Jieshi, a man of dignified elegance and composed bearing, repeatedly received imperial decrees and oversaw this mountain, earning the admiration of all for his virtuous conduct. The mountain’s grotto-heavens and blessed lands have, since the Han, Jin, Tang, and Song dynasties, produced figures renowned in the world. Today, Master Jieshi’s circle of Daoist friends shines like pearls in the deep or jade amidst the hills, their brilliance enhancing the streams and rocks. Truly, the mountain’s splendor is tied to the quality of its people. For those who dwell here or visit, if they do not purify body and mind, earnestly follow the Supreme’s teachings of clarity and stillness, and reverently uphold the Great Dao to honor this mountain, they will only deepen the shame of the forests and the remorse of the valleys, betraying the aspirations of Master Jieshi and his companions. I have thus set these words down.

Written on the first day of the sixth month in the third year of the Zhida era,
Preceptor Wu Quanjie of the Orthodox Daoist Lineage.

A gazetteer serves to meticulously trace the origins, developments, and details of all things, recording names, categories, and particulars without omission. Thus, it is valued for its breadth of documentation and thoroughness of account, ensuring that the past is transmitted and the future is informed. Great Dipper Celestial Pillar, a grand and wondrous site in the southeast, abounds in matters worthy of record. Yet during the Zhenghe era of the Song, Tang Zixia’s *Record of the True Realm* has become untraceable, and the compilations from the Duanping era were likewise fragmentary. Fearing that its sacred traces and extraordinary accounts would fade into oblivion, I entrusted Daoist Meng Zongbao and the recluse Deng Muxin to jointly gather old records, consult elders, and verify sources in compiling the *Illustrated Gazetteer of Dongxiao*. Within its pages, the mountain’s scenic beauty, the layouts of its palaces and halls, the traces of sagely sojourns and transformations, and the finest writings of eminent worthies are all preserved without omission. Not only will those who wander or rest here perceive both past and present, but even those who have never set foot upon it will, upon glimpsing this gazetteer, feel as though they wander amidst emerald dragons and white deer, their spirits soaring with the clouds and mist—an aid to the purification of the heart.

Respectfully inscribed on the full moon of the eleventh month in the ninth year of the Dade era,
Shen Duofu, Abbot of Great Dipper Mountain.

*Record of the Grotto-Heaven of Great Dipper, Volume One*
Compiled by Deng Muxin of this mountain.

**On the Daoist Abbeys and Observatories**

The perfected who attain the Dao regard the realm of Non-Being as their homeland and the Great Void as their dwelling. The radiance of sun and moon, the transformations of mist and cloud, the vastness of lakes and seas, the grandeur of mountains and marshes—all these are but transient lodgings for the eye and lash, mere objects of perception. Why, then, should they covet the beauty of a single ravine or gorge, or seek repose in a single hall or chamber, mingling with the common folk in the world of men?

Truly, the ancient Dao has grown faint with time, and the pure wind no longer prevails. Those who chase after desires and passions—how could they know the supremacy of clarity and stillness? Those who exalt ambition and fame—how could they believe in the attainability of immortality? Thus, the Most High established teachings, sagely emperors turned their minds to it, the Yellow Emperor sought the Dao on Mount Kongtong, and Emperor Yao beheld the Four Masters on the distant Guye. Thereafter, King Mu of Zhou, with his thatched pavilion, traced its origins, while Emperor Wu of Han, with his bamboo palaces and cassia halls, amplified its currents. Scattered across the realm arose secret chambers and resplendent courts, jade terraces and golden portals, nearly rivaling the Five Cities and Twelve Towers in loftiness. Not merely for refining cinnabar and smelting lead to hasten transcendence, nor for sounding bronze and jade to summon auspicious omens, but for the soaring of black crows and the gliding of wind, for emerald banners guiding the moon—these immortals often wandered among them. Such sights stir the aspiring to renounce glory, the greedy to abandon arrogance, to suddenly awaken to the peril of possessing a body, and to delight in returning to the Gate of Myriad Mysteries. Is this not the great pivot for transforming customs and the grand principle for honoring the Dao and esteeming virtue?

The *Daoist Canon* records that within the Four Seas, there are forty-six major and minor grotto-heavens and seventy-two blessed lands, among which Dongxiao holds a place. Old gazetteers assert that it, along with Chongfu on Mount Song, uniquely ranks as the foremost of all abbeys and observatories in the world, its prestige unmatched by any other. Indeed, what is fashioned by heaven and earth does not wax or wane by human effort, yet the institutions of reverence through the ages must not go unrecorded.

**The Abbey of Dongxiao**
This mountain is the Grotto-Heaven of Great Dipper’s Mystic Canopy and the Blessed Land of Heaven’s Pillar, located eighteen *li* south of Yuqian County in Hangzhou. The *Prefectural Gazetteer* states: In the third year of *Yuanfeng* (107 BCE) during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, an abbey and altar were first established before the Great Dipper Grotto as a site for casting dragon tablets to pray for blessings—a tradition now spanning over fifteen hundred years.

In the first year of *Hongdao* (683 CE) during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, Master Pan of this mountain was exhorted to build the Abbey of Heaven’s Pillar facing south. Its four boundaries were walled, and a thousand-pace radius was forbidden to woodcutters, becoming a forest of longevity. During the reign of Emperor Zhongzong, the abbey was granted a manor. Later, Master Zhu altered its orientation to face north. In the second year of *Qianning* (895 CE), King Wusu of the Qian family, together with Master Jianqiu, surveyed the mountain’s terrain and restored its orientation to the *jia* direction, which remains the foundation of the present abbey. In the second year of *Guanghua* (899 CE), the abbey’s map was submitted to the throne, and an imperial edict praised it, as recorded in the *Record of the Abbey of Heaven’s Pillar*.

When the Qian family submitted their territory to the Song, the abbey was renamed the Abbey of Heaven’s Pillar. In the fifth year of *Xiangfu* (1012 CE) during the reign of Emperor Zhenzong, at the petition of the reverent and cultured Duke Wenhui, Yao Zuo, it was renamed the Abbey of Dongxiao. Fifteen *qing* of fields in Renhe County were bestowed, all taxes remitted, along with ritual implements such as bells and chimes. One novice was ordained annually, and during the *Yingqing* and other festivals, jiao rites were held, with the prefecture covering expenses. Green petitions and vermilion memorials were composed by the Academy of Scholarly Worthies and submitted to the throne, after which imperial decrees were issued for repairs and offerings.

In the fourth year of *Tiansheng* (1026 CE) during the reign of Emperor Renzong, the Daoist Institute detailed and ranked twenty famous mountain grottoes and abbeys across the realm, with Hangzhou’s Abbey of Dongxiao at Great Dipper Grotto placed fifth. It was further decreed that dragon tablets be cast annually, and during prayers, imperial incense would be sealed and bestowed, with eunuchs or officials dispatched to the mountain.

In the second year of *Zhenghe* (1112 CE), Abbot and Supervisor He Shizhao, finding the abbey’s structures dilapidated, journeyed to Bianjing to petition the court. An edict granted three hundred ordination certificates, and the Two Zhe Circuit’s Transport Commission was tasked with oversight. Later, due to the Fang La rebellion, the abbey was destroyed by war and fire.

After Emperor Gaozong’s southern crossing, in the twenty-fifth year of *Shaoxing* (1155 CE), funds were drawn from the treasury to rebuild the Hall of August Heaven. To its east, the Hall of Response was erected, and to its left, the Passage of Illumination was opened—a cloister where the abbey’s abbot concurrently presided over rituals.

In the second year of *Qiandao* (1166 CE) during the reign of Emperor Xiaozong, on the third month, the Retired Emperor Dezong and the Empress Dowager Xianren visited to celebrate its completion. During the *gengshen* and *jiazi* days of the imperial birthdays, rites were held at the abbey’s request, with green petitions composed by the abbey’s scribe and submitted for offerings. Official soldiers were dispatched to guard the site, but later, the soldiers were withdrawn, and villagers from the mountain’s foothills were employed as tenants to prevent fires.

In the seventh year of *Chunyou* (1247 CE) during the reign of Emperor Lizong, Master Sun Chudao of the Numinous Aid and Perfected Communication petitioned for funds to purchase additional properties to supplement the abbey’s resources, thereby further expanding its scale and grandeur.

During the *Zhenghe* era, following the precedent of the Tang Abbey of Heaven’s Pillar, the Ministry of Rites of the Ministry of Rites issued an official seal to the Abbey of Dongxiao. In the second year of *Qingyuan* (1196 CE), as the seal had faded over time, Prefect Chen Yiming had it reissued.

Since the beginning of the Song dynasty, during imperial birthdays, the abbey hosted grand rituals, with civil and military officials from the county entering the mountain to conduct rites, while abbots from other mountains attended in ranks. After the southern crossing, only Daoists performed rites at the abbey, while county officials conducted ceremonies at the Temple of Universal Salvation. Whenever high-ranking officials retired or were dismissed, they assumed the title of *Supervisor of the Abbey of Dongxiao in Lin’an Prefecture*.

In the winter of *Xianchun* *jiayin* (1274 CE), a fire broke out due to negligence, reducing the abbey to ashes. In the *bingzi* year of *Zhiyuan* (1276 CE), reconstruction began but was incomplete when it was again destroyed in the summer of *jiashen* (1284 CE).

Following the *jiashen* year (1284 CE), the abbey’s halls were rebuilt anew, their scale surpassing that of former times, dedicated solely to the state’s rituals of incense-burning, prayers for heaven, and imperial birthday celebrations. Whenever the emperor’s birthday arrived, the ritual platform was established within the abbey as customary. The abbey was overseen by the *Office Overseeing Daoist Affairs in the Jiangnan Circuits*, which governed Daoist institutions across the Jiang-Huai, Jing, and Xiang regions, and reported the affairs of this renowned mountain to the throne. In the eighteenth year of *Zhiyuan* (1281 CE), an imperial edict was received to protect the mountain’s gates. In the eleventh month of the twenty-third year of *Zhiyuan* (1286 CE), another imperial edict extended protection to all abbeys and temples on the mountain. In the first and second years of *Yuanzhen* (1295–1296 CE) and the third year of *Dade* (1299 CE), successive imperial decrees appointed the abbey’s abbot as *Supervisor and Director of the Abbey*, with authority over all abbeys and temples on the mountain. In the sixth month of the eighth year of *Dade* (1304 CE), the abbey was further honored as a repository for imperial seals, and the *Ministry of Rites* of the *Central Secretariat* cast an official seal for the *Office of the Supervisor of Dongxiao Abbey in Hangzhou Circuit*.

Among the renowned mountains under heaven, apart from the Five Peaks, only eight are called the "Pillars of Heaven." Five lie beyond the realm, their details now lost; of the three remaining within the Middle Kingdom, Dongxiao’s grandeur has been revered through the ages, nearly equal in esteem to the Five Peaks. It far surpasses those of Shuzhou and Shouyang—this is no mere coincidence, and thus it is recorded here at the outset.

**Gate of Universal Perfection**
This gate lies beyond the four gates of Yu Hang County. Built during the *Shaoxing* era (1131–1162 CE) of the Song, it was said that one entered Dongxiao through here. Reconstructed during the *Zhiyuan* era (1264–1294 CE), it was earlier, during the *Chunyou* era (1241–1252 CE) of the Song, that the mountain’s resident, Bei Daqin, purchased the stone-paved path, lined it with trees, and extended it eighteen *li* to the Nine-Lock Mountain Gate.

**Nine-Lock Mountain Gate**
Located three *li* outside the abbey at the foot of Nine-Lock Mountain, its name is inscribed in three large seal-script characters, archaic and striking, written by Cheng Ju.

**Outer Gate**
Along the main road through Nine-Lock Mountain, the path forks toward Dragon and Phoenix Caves. Ascending straight leads to the path of *Xizhen* Cave; turning at the road’s end, one crosses the *Meeting Immortals Bridge* and passes the *Emerald Twist Pavilion*. Stone slabs flank the path on either side, their form like twin watchtowers, marking the true convergence of the gates. The plaque reads *Cave Heaven, Blessed Land*, bestowed by Emperor Lizong of the Song in the seventh year of *Chunyou* (1247 CE).

**Double-Plate Gate**
Entering from the Outer Gate, one crosses the *Bridge of Mystic Unity*. Two gates stand facing each other: on the left, the seal-script *Celestial Pillar Spring*, beside which lies a pond; on the right, the seal-script *Great Purification Cave*, the entrance to the cave.

**Triple Gate**
Constructed in the thirty-second year of *Shaoxing* (1162 CE) with funds granted from the imperial treasury.

In the *Zhiyuan* reign’s *wuyin* year (1278 CE), the *Mountain Recluse Studio* was constructed; in the *guisi* year (1353 CE), it was rebuilt in disarray, and the *Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion* was added behind it, which had previously been absent.

**Void-Expanse Altar**
Located before the Main Hall. The old gazetteer records: In the second year of *Jingfu* (893 CE) of the Tang, King Qian Wu Su, following the rites of the time, established a ritual platform and invited Master Wenqiu to present the *Three Primordials’ Registers* here. In the *gengzi* year of *Dade* (1300 CE), it was expanded and renovated.

**Hall of the Three Purities**
This is the site where Lord Guo of Zhen originally built his thatched hut. Before the hall stand three pines, planted by his own hand, now no longer extant. When King Qian relocated the seated orientation from *geng* to *jia*, he referred to this place. During the *Zhenghe* era of the Song (1111–1118 CE), amid the Fang La rebellion, only the Hall of the Emperor’s Life Star remained intact. The presiding Daoist, Jin Zhiyi, memorialized the throne, and by imperial decree, it was renamed the *Hall of the Three Purities*. The sacred images were sculpted by Meng Chengzhong of Bianjing, renowned as a masterpiece of unparalleled skill. In the *gengyin* year of *Zhiyuan* (1290 CE), it was rebuilt, its grandeur surpassing even its former state. Cassia and cypress trees stand interspersed before it.

**Pavilion of August Heaven**
Situated behind the eastern hemp fields, the hall was originally constructed in the twenty-fifth year of *Shaoxing* (1155 CE) with funds bestowed from the imperial treasury. In the *xinchou* year of *Dade* (1301 CE), it was rebuilt as a pavilion. Surrounded by four mountains, it is the finest vantage for sightseeing.

**Hall of the Jade Armillary**
Located east of the Storehouse Courtyard, built during the *Jianyan* era (1127–1130 CE). In the *xinsi* year of *Zhiyuan* (1281 CE), the *Returning Purple Studio* was constructed here.

**Hall of the Protector Sage**
Originally stood to the left of the Main Hall, built during the *Jianyan* era. In the *xinsi* year of *Zhiyuan* (1281 CE), the *Harmonious Clouds Studio* was built on the eastern side of the Triple Gate.

**Shrine of Emperor Zhang of Mount Ci**
Formerly situated outside the Official Gate on the western mound. During the *Kaixi* era (1205–1207 CE), the inner court bestowed a divine image along with attendant figures on either side. In the *Jingding* era (1260–1264 CE), it was relocated to the right of the Triple Gate. In the *gengchen* year of *Zhiyuan* (1280 CE), the *Gourd Recluse Studio* was built, and in the *xinmao* year (1351 CE), the same studio rebuilt it.

**Shrine of the Dragon King and Immortal Officials**
Located behind the western response hall, built during the *Jianyan* era. It was bestowed the plaque *Temple of Auspicious Response*. In the *renwu* year of *Zhiyuan* (1282 CE), the *Pure Void Studio* was constructed. Now, the two immortal officials of *Cave Heaven* and *Blessed Land* are jointly enshrined here, following ancient tradition. Beneath the shrine lies the *Clapping Hands Spring*, which shares its source with the *Great Purification Spring*, both known as *Dragon Wells*. Initially, in the ninth year of *Shaoxing* (1139 CE), by imperial decree, an iron slip was cast into the cave, and rain was obtained, whereupon the deity was enfeoffed as *Marquis of Good Response*. The edict read:

> *"We consider that mountains, forests, rivers, and valleys, which emit clouds and qi to form wind and rain, must be accorded ritual rank and reverently served with prayers. This cave heaven is the dwelling of a divine spirit, bending and stretching, transforming with each breath, summoning wind and clouds. When the seasons falter, it swiftly bestows sweet rains. The officials have reported the circumstances, and We now confer the noble title of Marquis to manifest favor upon the black-haired people, that they may revere and obey the divine mandate. Let him be specially enfeoffed as Marquis of Good Response."*

In the third year of *Qingyuan* (1197 CE), he was further enfeoffed as *Marquis of Good Response and Numinous Aid*; in the first year of *Jiatai* (1201 CE), as *Marquis of Good Response, Numinous Aid, and Illustrious Efficacy*; in the third year of *Duanping* (1236 CE), as *Marquis of Good Response, Numinous Aid, Illustrious Efficacy, and Vast Fortune*; and additionally, as *Duke of Numinous Moisture*.

**Cloud Hall**
Situated behind the western hemp fields, it serves to receive wandering Daoists from all directions.

During the *Chunyou* and *Xianyou* reigns of the Song (1241–1274 CE), gatherings of eminent Daoists became a frequent topic of conversation. Even today, renowned scholars from north and south continue to visit and reside here, no less than in former times.

**Dawn Visitor’s Lodge**
Located to the right of Cloud Hall, it serves as a resting place for wandering monks.

**Pavilions**
Named *Emerald Canopy*, *Soaring Jade*, *Pure Sound*, *Verdant Haze*, *Gathering Mushrooms*, *Nine Bends Revealing the Landscape Gate*, *Valley Mouth*, *Stone Chamber Revealing the Grotto-Heaven Gate*, *Auspicious Radiance*, *Timely Frost*, and *Gathering Immortals Revealing the Ancient Relics Gate*.

**White Deer Mountain Lodge**
Situated atop Stone Chamber. Formerly, Lu Yongzhong had resided on the eastern side of Stone Chamber and established a Daoist abbey there. Zhu Miaoxing cultivated and refined himself at this site for twenty years before attaining liberation through *shijie*. Later, Master Ruan of Tianmu Mountain dwelled here, and a Daoist from Quanzhou named Chen carved winding paths along the mountain, built thatched huts in mutual support, and unearthed many extraordinary stones while excavating the earth. The path extended over a hundred paces, resembling a screen. After warfare ravaged the area, Ruan and Chen departed. In the *jiachen* year of the *Zhide* era (1304 CE), the Mountain Lodge was rebuilt here, accompanied by an inscription.

**Two Official Residences**
One is located half a *li* southwest of Yuhang County, above the Great Stream. Built in the fourth year of *Changxing* during the Later Tang (933 CE) and named *Celestial Pillar Examination Hall*, it was later restored during the *Xianchun* reign of the Song (1265–1274 CE). Before its gate stands a grove of catalpa trees, whose summer shade is delightfully dense. It lies to the east of the Three Gates.

**Dharma Hall**
Situated behind the Main Hall.

In the first year of the *Kaixi* era of the Song (1205 CE), funds were allocated from the imperial treasury for its construction. Emperor Ningzong bestowed the name *Evolving Teachings Hall* in an inscribed plaque. It was rebuilt in the *yiyou* year of the *Zhiyuan* era (1285 CE). To its left and right stand two stones, formed by nature itself. Behind them, dark cliffs rise imposingly; with human effort, they were stacked into peaks and ridges. A small grotto was carved in their midst, its winding path leading to the summit.

**Abbot’s Quarters**
Located behind the *Evolving Teachings Hall*.

**Storehouse Courtyard**
Situated in the eastern *Ma* precinct, rebuilt in the *yiyou* year of the *Zhiyuan* era (1285 CE). A cinnabar spring flows through its midst. The *New Pond* recorded by Li Xuanqing of the Tang is found here.

**Refectory Hall**
Located in the western *Ma* precinct, rebuilt in the *wuxu* year of the *Dade* era (1298 CE).

**Daoist Abbey**
Situated behind the western *Ma* precinct. Formerly, there were three abbeys: *Upper Clarity*, *Refined Contemplation*, and *Southern Mound*. Today, they are divided into eighteen hermitages. At their center lies a pond, around which the hermitages are arranged. The pond’s waters, whether full or dry, are often said to reflect fortune or misfortune.

To the left correspond seven hermitages:
- *Mountain Reclusion*, *Mountain Simplicity*, *Peak Reclusion*, *Lofty Reclusion*, *Joyful Clouds*, and *Grain Reclusion* belong to the *Upper Clarity Abbey*;
- *Returning Purple* belongs to the *Southern Mound Abbey*.

To the right correspond four hermitages:
- *Pure Reclusion*, *Valley Reclusion*, and *Coiled Reclusion* belong to the *Upper Clarity Abbey*;
- *Pure Emptiness* belongs to the *Southern Mound Abbey*.

Facing the front are seven hermitages:
- *Gourd Reclusion*, *Tangerine Reclusion*, *Leisurely*, *Tranquil Reclusion*, and *Learned Reclusion* belong to the *Upper Clarity Abbey*;
- *Joyful* and *Jade Gourd* belong to the *Refined Contemplation Abbey*.

**Hall of Daoist Selection**
Located behind the western precinct, rebuilt in the *yiyou* year of the *Zhiyuan* era (1285 CE).

**Abode of the Utmost Dao**
Situated thirty *li* north of Yuhang County, west of Cao Bridge. Originally built in the first year of the *Wenming* era of the Tang (684 CE) under the name *Fortunate Karma Abbey*, where Master Pan attained the Dao, as recorded in *Cloud Companions*. In the third year of the *Zhiping* era of the Song (1066 CE), it was renamed to its current title. Before it stands an ancient pine tree, its trunk requiring two people to encircle.

Behind it stand two *kuyao* trees, their girth rivaling that of the pine, where egrets and herons nest among the branches. The kitchen courtyard houses four massive cauldrons cast during the *Xining* era of the Song (1068–1077 CE), their rims inscribed with the year, month, and the names of donors. The recluse Ye Xuanwen wrote a poem:

*Still stand the massive cauldrons, bearing marks of Xining’s reign,*
*Where emerald mists in springtime deep weave paths through ancient lanes.*
*A thousand springs the plow has passed o’er one lone tree’s embrace—*
*Wild fields beneath the snowflake winds where white wings drift through space.*

**Palace of Dragon Virtue Communing with Immortals**
Located south of the Yuhang County market, this site was once chosen as a dwelling by Zhao Rutan, Duke Wenyì of the Southern Tang. In the *guiwei* year of the *Zhiyuan* era (1283 CE), the mountain-dwelling Daoist Lang Rushan, enamored of its scenic beauty, exhausted his personal wealth to renovate the palace entirely, making its gardens, pavilions, and ponds unrivaled in their time. The Perfected Lord of Dao-Emanation, Numinous Response, Harmonious Tranquility, and Primordial Stillness inscribed the palace’s name plaque.

**Palace of Primordial Clarity**
Situated in Xinlu of Jinnan Township, Lin’an County, this was the former residence of the mountain-dwelling Daoist Shu Yuanyi. In the *jiawu* year of the *Zhiyuan* era (1294 CE), a palace was built upon the site, its towering pavilions embraced by mountains and waters, deemed the finest sight in the region.

**Observatory Soaring to Heaven**
Located at the eastern foot of Mount Tiānzhù, beyond the Nine-Lock Mountain Gate. Originally, during the *Xianchun* era of the Song (1265–1274 CE), the mountain-dwelling Daoist Gong Wenhuan built it at Qīngpō in Deqing. In the *renwu* year of the *Zhiyuan* era (1282 CE), the palace overseer Zhou Yunhe relocated and rebuilt it here. The current mountain-dwelling Daoist Shen Duofu has since dredged springs, arranged rocks, and planted pines and plum trees, creating a place of serene wandering and lofty vistas, as recorded in its annals. The recluse Ye Xuanwen of Qiantang dwelled here; in the first month of the *bingwu* year of the *Dade* era (1306 CE), after twenty years, he attained the Dao and ascended as an immortal.

**Observatory of Cavernous Dawn**
Located east of Anle Mountain by the river outside the eastern walls of Yuhang County, on the former site of Chen Jiqing. Jiqing, a native of Yuhang, was said to have encountered an immortal from Mount Zhongnan who fashioned a boat from bamboo leaves. During the *guihai* year of the *Jingding* era of the Song (1263 CE), the mountain-dwelling Daoist Bei Daqin built the observatory here, where rows of pines cast dappled shade and flowing waters wind about, while a grove of plum trees is named *Endless Spring*. Formerly, it was a place of abundant hospitality, as recorded in its annals.

**Observatory of Primordial Yang**

Behind Tianzhu Steps, three *li* south at the rear of Great Cleansing Mountain, the observatory was built by Daoist Hao Churen during the *Xianchun* era of the Song (1265–1274 CE) and later reconstructed and expanded in the *xinsi* year of the *Zhiyuan* era (1281 CE). The mountain is deep and the forest dense, its gates and paths secluded, evoking a sense beyond the dusty world—though few travelers venture here.

**Chongzhen Abbey**
Located in Changxing Prefecture of Huzhou Circuit, this was the site where the Jin-era immortal Ge Xuan refined his elixir. During the *Xianchun* era of the Song, the abbey’s Daoist Zhou Guoshou restored it using an ancient plaque, and in the *jiawu* year of the *Zhiyuan* era (1294 CE), its abbot Zhou Guisheng renovated it entirely anew. Flowing waters encircle the grounds, while rows of pines, ancient junipers, and aged cassia trees make it an ideal retreat.

**Longde Abbey**
Situated in Ganpu Town of Jiaxing Circuit, it was founded by the abbey’s Daoist Liu Yingshan during the *Jingding* era of the Song (1260–1264 CE). Adjacent to the sea’s edge, it serves as a convenient site for scholars and commoners to offer prayers.

**Xuantong Abbey**
Located on Guixin Street in Hangzhou. Originally part of Yang Mansion’s *Kanbi Garden*, which boasted the charm of *Lanting*’s lush groves and tall bamboos, the abbey was established by the mountain-dwelling Daoist Lang Rushan in the *guisi* year of the *Zhiyuan* era (1293 CE). It was later renamed Xuantong Abbey in the *xinchou* year of the *Dade* era (1301 CE).

**Mingxing Palace**
Built atop Mingxing Marsh, two *li* east of Yuhang County, the abbey was founded by the abbey’s Daoist Shi Defang in the *xinmao* year of the *Zhiyuan* era (1291 CE) under the name *Rilaiqing* and later renamed Mingxing Palace in the *bingwu* year of the *Dade* era (1306 CE).

**Dongyang Abbey**
Located in the eastern outskirts of Ninghai County in Taizhou, it was converted from the residence of the Zhang family by the abbey’s Daoist Yang Yingshi in the *guimao* year of the *Dade* era (1303 CE).

**Shrine of the Sacred Peak Abbey**
Situated above South Lake in Yuhang County. Originally a garden known as *Wugong Pu* tended by locals, the land was later donated to build the shrine. Gazing toward West Stream, the surrounding peaks stand in solemn array. Beside the shrine rises a small hill called Phoenix Mountain, named for its resemblance to the bird. Towering rocks stand in clusters, while winding waters trace hundreds of turns. The elixir furnace of the immortal Ge Xuan once occupied its heights and depths, large enough to seat several people. A pavilion overlooks the stream opposite it, and today a Daoist abbey stands to the shrine’s right, named Fengshan Abbey.

**Qingzhen Abbey**
Located on the southern slope of Qingtan Mountain on East Tianzhu Ridge, it was built by Zhu Teli, the *Zhigongshi* of the abbey, during the *Xianchun* era of the Song. Its springs and rocks are of surpassing purity and beauty.

**Ningzhen Abbey**
Situated outside the Nine Locks in Mubu Hollow, it was relocated here from the city by the abbey’s Daoist Yao Chongdao in the *renwu* year of the *Zhiyuan* era (1282 CE).

**Ruoxu Abbey**
Located west of the market in Yuhang County, it was originally the residence of the Wo family. In the *wuzǐ* year of the *Zhiyuan* era (1288 CE), the mountain-dwelling Daoist Cao Zhijian acquired the land and built the abbey.

**Tongming Abbey**
Situated in Xiang Hollow of Yuhang County, it was founded by the abbey’s Daoist Jin Ziji in the *jichou* year of the *Zhiyuan* era (1289 CE) as a place to honor ancestors and repay their origins.

**Yiqing Abbey**
Located in Lin’an County, at a site called Rear Flood, it was built by the abbey’s Daoist He Ziqing in the *renwu* year of the *Zhiyuan* era (1282 CE).

**Ziqing Hermitage**
Situated below Green Camphor Ridge in Shang Hollow, it was founded by the abbey’s Daoist Xu Yunxi in the *yiyou* year of the *Zhiyuan* era (1285 CE).

**Bihu Hermitage**
Located below Stone Jade Mountain in Li Hollow, it was built by Vice-Abbot Li Yuangang during the *Xianchun* era of the Song.

**Xishan Hermitage**
Situated at Tianzhu Steps, it was built by Vice-Abbot Jin Changqing in the *dingyou* year of the *Dade* era (1297 CE).

**Xianyin Hermitage**
Located behind Laixian Crag at the foot of Green Mountain, it was founded by the abbey’s Daoist Wang Yunsheng in the *jichou* year of the *Zhiyuan* era (1289 CE).

**Xueyuan Hermitage**
Situated west of Tianzhu Ridge, it was built by the abbey’s Daoist Lu Jixiu in the *xinmao* year of the *Zhiyuan* era (1291 CE).

**Taiping Hermitage**
Located in Lin’an County, it was founded by Daoist Xu Yuanying in the *jiachen* year of the *Dade* era (1304 CE).

**Jixu Academy**
Situated in the Azure Pond Blessed Land, five *li* east of Yuhang County, it features a massive well said to be where the immortal Ge Xuan once refined his elixir. The academy was built by Daoist Meng Zongbao in the *bingshen* year of the *Yuanzhen* era (1296 CE) as a place for study, retreat, and discourse. The *Hanlin* Academician Zhang Bochun inscribed its plaque, while the scholar Deng Muxin composed its record. The poet Fang Hui of Ziyang Mountain wrote:

*Heaven and earth hold spring within the frozen kernel,*
*When the time comes, bees and butterflies swarm the eastern wind.*
*Myriad transformations arise from roots without limit,*
*A single spark of numinous brightness sways the great void.*
*In wondrous ways, a thousand rivers share the bright moon,*
*Lightly, the six directions mark the soaring wild goose.*
*Guarding the mystery, know silence unites dragon and tiger—*
*How could one cling to the redness of the crucible’s midnight hour?*

The poet Qiu Shancun of Qiantang wrote:

*Erecting a hut by the eastern marsh’s wild waters,*
*Within the room, white arises; upon the seat, spring.*
*Realizing the empty and cavernous holds fundamentally nothing,*
*One must trust that clarity and brightness possess their own spirit.*
*Secluded classics and grass flowers suffice for delight,*
*Leisurely windows and brushes leave no dust behind.*
*Wine manuals and elixir formulas are not my affairs—*
*A single old man harbors ten thousand volumes.*

**On Mountains and Waters**
Of all the scenic mountains and waters in Zhexi, none surpass those of Hangzhou; of Hangzhou’s mountains and waters, none surpass those of Tianmu; yet the splendor of Tianmu remains unmatched by the Great Cleansing Grotto-Heaven. For the waters of Great Cleansing Mountain trace their source to Tianmu, where the winds and qi coil and twist, ridges and peaks intertwine in slanting embrace, stretching nearly a hundred *li* before converging here to nurture spirit and cultivate elegance. The meandering curves of Cao Creek guide their flow, while the vast expanse of South Lake gathers their might. Beyond nine interlocking gates, a single pillar stands at the center—could this not be a marvel of Heaven and Earth, a sacred precinct of the immortals?

The *Prefecture Gazetteer* records: Ascending Tianmu Mountain and leaning upon the Celestial Altar’s stone chamber, one sees all ranges rushing southwest. Twin streams hasten to merge at Yuqian County, their flow briefly arrested as if in hesitation. Turning back to gaze at Tianmu, it looms through layered clouds like a towering ancient general reining in his steed from behind—its momentum unstoppable. In but a moment, it has surged to Lin’an County. Great Official Mountain, mere foothill in comparison, follows the contours to the Nine Locks, where it narrows into a solitary peak. Encircling it are the "Celestial Pillar" and other summits, as if pausing to rest—yet soon they rise in serried ranks, advancing toward Yuhang, descending to Northern High Peak of Wulin, then abruptly soaring as Southern High Peak. The Eight Coiling Peaks of Ciyun Ridge lash out, while Phoenix Mountain’s Seven Guest Peaks rear their heads and tuck their tails, poised as if about to take flight and alight—only the great river bars their way. Ah, how extraordinary!

Surveying Hangzhou’s mountains and rivers in broad strokes, this account is no exaggeration.

**Tianmu Mountain**
The *Taiping Huanyu Ji* states: Tianmu Mountain rises 3,900 *zhang* in height, spans 550 *li* in circumference, and abounds in fine stones and sweet springs, with ancient trees centuries old. At its summit lie two lakes resembling left and right eyes—hence its name. An ancient *Eastern Mountain Inscription* reads in part: *"Peaks pierce the rosy clouds, mist-veiled emerald ridges drip with haze—names too numerous to record."* There are three pools—upper, middle, and lower—where dragons dwell, their source veins interconnected. The former residence of Immortal Xu Wu lies west of Stone Chamber Peak, and the Celestial Master of Han ascended to heaven here with his entire family. This is the primal ancestor of the Celestial Pillar, while the "dragon soaring and phoenix dancing" of Qiantang are its descendants.

**Yellow Mountain**
Located northwest of the palace, this is the loftiest peak, progenitor of all mountains—visible even a hundred *li* away. To its left, it gives rise to Great Cleansing; to its right, to Celestial Pillar. At its base lies Longshui Bay, where Crouching Tiger Crag resides.

**Nine Locks Mountain**
Eighteen *li* west of Yuhang’s outer city walls, one follows the stream upstream. Seven peaks converge on either side, each rising hundreds of *chi* from the earth, their bases interlocking like canine teeth. The path winds nine times alongside the stream—hence the name "Nine Locks." Enthusiasts have bestowed names upon each:
1. Celestial Pass
2. Cloud Concealment
3. Soaring Simurgh
4. Scaling the Void
5. Communing with the Real
6. Dragon’s Chant
7. Grotto’s Mystery
8. Cloud’s Pride
9. Facing the Origin

**Great Cleansing Mountain**
North of the palace, it comprises four peaks—the grandest within the Nine Locks. The Western Grotto commands its neck, the Stone Chamber emerges from its flank, and the Celestial Altar crowns its summit—all prized sites of the mountain. The mountain takes its name from its grotto, as old records state it can "cleanse the dust from the heart"—hence "Great Cleansing." Though not all mountains derive their names from such explanations, the oral traditions of elders are unlikely to deceive. Master Xuantong once trod these slopes in sword and sandals.

**Celestial Pillar Mountain**
Southwest of the palace, it consists of three peaks standing opposite Great Cleansing, their heights evenly matched. From outside the palace, it appears towering like a pillar, and at its summit stands a stone column over a *zhang* tall, two arm-spans in girth—hence the mountain’s name. It is one of the Fifty-Seven Blessed Lands, presided over by the Earth Immortal Wang Boyuan.

According to transmitted records, Heaven has eight pillars, three of which lie in China: one in Shuzhou, one in Shouyang, and the present one in Yuhang. As the main mountain of Dongxiao, it was anciently called the Celestial Pillar Abbey. Old gazetteers describe it as a place of pure winds and harmonious qi, fertile soil and pristine springs, where divine serpents do not sting and fierce beasts grow docile. Since Emperor Wu of Han manifested numinous traces here and established palace altars, successive dynasties have conducted prayers and exorcisms at this site.

Mount Milk is the case mountain before the abbey, expanded and cultivated by the Qian clan.

Incense Burner Mountain lies behind Mount Milk before the abbey, its peak sharply pointed.

Green Sandalwood Mountain stands southeast of the abbey, to the right of the Celestial Pillar’s flank. Though not particularly tall, its springs and rocks are exceptionally fine, surpassing all other mountains. Here lie the Verdant Emerald Cliff, Trial Sword Rock, and Coming Worthies Grotto, along with Ice Kettle and Mirror Pool.

Green Catalpa Mountain lies west of the abbey, tracing the path of Yellow Mountain. Shaped like a folding screen, it faces White Deer Mountain, and its level ground forms Upper Hollow.

Green Cao Mountain lies below Green Catalpa Mountain to the west of the abbey, connecting eastward to the path of Upper Hollow and westward to the Cave of Resting Perfection.

White Deer Mountain is part of Great Cleansing Mountain, now called Central Peak. It is named for the white deer that descended from heaven to welcome Master Xu the Perfected upon his ascension here.

Cinnabar Mountain lies beyond Yellow Mountain, vast and towering, stretching over ten *li*.

Yang Village sits at its foot. Behind it lies Echoing Water Stone, where the stream’s flow produces a resonant murmur.

Purple Bamboo Hollow lies west of Green Catalpa Mountain. Named for the purple bamboo that once grew abundantly here.

Bitter Bamboo Hollow stands at the head of the Eastern Celestial Pillar Ridge, roughly a *li* from the abbey, adjacent to the Immortal’s Trace Rock. Its form resembles a cloud rising from the earth, poised to take flight yet still grounded.

Cao Creek—*The Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: "Celestial Eye Mountain, also called Floating Jade, is the source of Cao Creek." Today, it flows from the borders of Yuqian and Lin’an counties, passing through Yuhang and Qiantang before entering Huzhou and reaching Great Marsh. The prefectural gazetteer records that its banks abound with Cao flowers, which scatter like drifting snow when autumn winds arise—hence the name Cao Creek. *The Treatise on Geography* further notes: "West of Yuhang, it is also called Cold Creek. Along its banks stand the four mountains of Qin, Crane, Visitor, and Crone, each with settlements at their feet." From the abbey to the creek’s mouth spans five *li*, known as the Celestial Pillar Footpath. Beside it lies a well, also called Celestial Pillar Spring, as the pillar’s flowing waters follow the Nine Locks Mountain eastward to reach this creek.

South Lake—during the season of plum rains, when Cao Creek swells, its waters gather here before draining into the great stream. A long embankment and small bridges emerge, its misty islets resembling those of West Lake in Hangzhou. At other times, it runs dry, leaving only lush grasses as far as the eye can see.

Cinnabar Spring, also called Celestial Pillar Spring—this spring originates at the highest point, descending halfway down Celestial Pillar Mountain. At first, only a deep rumbling like thunder is heard; after over a hundred paces west of Great Cleansing Grotto, it emerges above ground. Clear and sweet, it never fails even in great droughts. A square pool stores its waters. When the sky is clear, a crimson glow appears, and the moss around it often takes on a purple hue. Su Shi’s poem reads: *"A hut idly nestled in Dongxiao Abbey, / Where the well holds cinnabar waters, ever red."* Hence the name Cinnabar Spring. The pavilion is called Pure Sound, borrowing Zuo Taichong’s phrase *"mountain waters have pure sounds."* Beyond supplying the kitchens and the Eighteen Vegetarian Halls, its waters irrigate all the fields of the surrounding land.

Kitchen Courtyard Square Pool—In the fifth year of the Dali era of the Tang, Prefect Fan Xili saw the spring’s veins seeping moisture and ordered a pool dug to serve the kitchens. Li Xuanqing recorded this.

Three Pools lie within the Gate of the Grotto-Heaven and Blessed Land. Two are to the left of the path, one to the right, arranged like the character *pin* (品). During the Qianning era of the Tang, King Qian Wusu had them excavated. A hidden stream, built of stacked stones for over a *li* from the front of Great Cleansing Grotto, channels the Celestial Pillar’s flowing waters into them. Their clarity is delightful. At the pool’s mouth, the stream becomes hidden again, winding five or six times in accordance with the land’s topography.

Emerald Dragon Pavilion—When Emperor Gaozong of the Song visited and strolled here, he admired it and granted funds to build a waterside pavilion. Located over thirty paces outside the abbey gate, the waters from the Three Pools inside the gate flow into the ravine. A few planks span the pool, where the surging currents roar like thunder, transforming and dancing in flight. The shade of the mountains and forests casts an emerald hue, hence the name Emerald Dragon, taken from Su Shi’s line *"beneath the pavilion, flowing waters where emerald dragons dance."* His likeness is enshrined behind the pavilion. Before it lies a slope with scattered sitting stones, where travelers invariably ascend to rest.

Cold Spring lies beside the stone altar by the road east of Meeting Immortals Bridge outside the abbey gate. Its veins are faint but flow ceaselessly through all seasons. Travelers scoop its waters to drink, colder than ice and snow—hence the name.

Peach Blossom Spring lies a few dozen paces west of Dragon Grotto. Its waters flow horizontally from a stone altar into the stream. In the past, people often saw peach blossom petals drifting out, their origin unknown—hence the name.

Stone Gate—From Coming Worthies Grotto, ascend over fifty paces east, traverse the undulating slopes, and reach the path to Green Sandalwood Mountain. To the right, the path clings to the cliff; to the left, it overlooks a deep ravine. A massive boulder stands beside it, facing the cliff—hence the name Little Stone Gate.

Moon Cavern—Beside the Grotto Libation lies a massive stone with a round, intricate aperture, roughly two *chi* wide and five or six *chi* deep—called Moon Cavern.

Ice Kettle—West of Moon Cavern lies a stone hollow storing waters that are intensely cold yet sweet—called Ice Kettle.

Mirror Pool—Below the Grotto Libation lies a stone hollow whose waters are so clear they reflect objects—called Mirror Pool.

Trial Sword Rock—From Coming Worthies Grotto, proceed east over two hundred paces to find a stone split in two, as if cleaved by a sword—hence the name.

Verdant Emerald Cliff—From Trial Sword Rock, advance another thirty paces to find a sheer cliff facing north, rising abruptly from the earth. It stands one or two *zhang* tall and twenty to thirty *zhang* wide. Its surface is lushly verdant, intricate, and wondrous beyond description. Here, the mountain’s vital essence, born at Coming Worthies, fully manifests after half a *li*. Stalactites atop the cliff emit a fragrant aroma when burned. A pair of cliffs stand opposite, separated by only a few *chi*, barely allowing passage. If opened by human effort, a pavilion could be built to fully appreciate the view. Today, a pavilion called Verdant Mist faces outward.

Stone Step Barrier—From the stone chamber, ascend several turns to find dark stones lining the path for over a hundred paces—called Stone Step Barrier.

Tongxian Bridge—Located on the main road to the Palace from Yuhang, four *li* from Tongzhen Gate. Built during the Jianyan era of the Song, it was formerly called Stone Gate Bridge. In the eighth month of the *jihai* year of the Dade reign, Palace Supervisor Yang Qingyi had it rebuilt.

Daoist Bridge—Half a *li* from Tongxian Bridge, originally constructed by the ancestral master of this palace. Commonly called Daoist Bridge.

Chaoyuan Bridge—Four *li* outside the palace, on the main road to the palace via Tianzhu Steps. Popularly known as Hutang Bridge. Expanded in height and breadth during the *guiyou* year of the Xianchun reign, it was named Chaoyuan Bridge.

Shuangxian Bridge—Three *li* outside the palace, commonly called Shuangqiao Head. Once, Perfected Lord Guo and Immortal Ge leaned on their staffs and conversed here, hence the name.

Yuquan Bridge—At the foot of the eastern Tianzhu Ridge, to the left of the Shrine of Stone Lord, two *li* from the palace. Commonly called Mache Bridge. Built during the Jianyan era of the Song, the Flying Jade Spring emerges from the ravine here, hence the name.

Mingfeng Bridge—To the left of Yun’gen Stone, commonly called Yuan Family Bridge. Built during the Jianyan era of the Song, it stands near Mingfeng Crag, hence the name.

Huixian Bridge—On the main road to the palace before the inscribed gate of Xizhen Cave, spanning the ravine. In the *jiachen* year of the Chunxi reign of the Song, Daoist Jiang Anzhuo, who had roamed lakes and seas in his youth and returned to seclusion in these mountains in later years, donated his robes and alms-bowl money to rebuild it.

Xuantong Bridge—Within the Gate of Cave Heaven and Blessed Land, its waters flow downward to the pond beneath Cuiqiao Pavilion. Once, Master Xuantong and King Wusu of Qian surveyed the terrain, excavated the pond, and built the bridge, hence the name.

An Ode to the Grotto Realm—Where do the immortals dwell?

From the *Liezi*: Beyond the Eastern Sea lie five divine mountains, while Dongfang Manqian speaks of ten isles. I have traversed the Weak Waters for three hundred thousand *li*, where boats cannot endure, and where pearl trees, jade forests, jeweled towers, and palaces of treasure lie beyond the reach of even the swiftest chariots. No wonder the common world dismisses such accounts as wild and fantastical.

Yet the thirty-six grotto-heavens exist within this realm—are they truly the abodes of immortals? Or are they not? The sun and moon traverse the central sky, descending into the blue sea, succeeding one another day and night without cease. Thunder erupts from the void, its roar resounding, shaking all things. If the world has never witnessed such wonders and I were to speak of them, would they believe me? Even a humble scholar with lofty aspirations may flee to deep forests or secluded valleys, withdrawing from the world. How much more so for those who transform like dragons or shed their husks like cicadas, drinking dew and dining on wind, leaving behind the stench of earthly dust to enter the misty vapors of the clouds—this must surely be so. Thus, within and beyond the four seas, one cannot say these grottoes do not exist, nor that such people are absent.

Take Qingcheng, Luofu, Wuyi, and Gouqu—were they not called grotto-heavens, I would still know them as realms of immortals and sages. Even a solitary boulder, mere fathoms high, split open like a coin, may bear the name of a grotto-heaven, with the Azure Lad and Immortal Guo each governing one. How could the traces of their flight and transformation fail to reach such places?

The Mysterious Canopy resides on Mount Dadi, yet the *Yunji* claims it lies on Mount Tianmu—could it be that Dadi is a descendant of Tianmu? Or perhaps the ancients who wrote these texts did not always visit the places themselves, leading to inaccuracies in their records. Even reliable histories are not immune to such errors, so this is hardly surprising.

**Dadi Grotto**—Half a *li* northwest of the palace. The *Biography of Lord Mao* states: The thirty-fourth grotto-heaven is called the Heaven of the Mysterious Canopy of Dadi, spanning four hundred *li* in circumference. Within it are sun and moon, halls of refined gold, jade chambers of immortals, and the place where fortunes and calamities are assessed. It is governed by the Perfected Jiang, and secretly connected to the profound paths of Huayang and Linwu.

Legend tells that Master Dongxuan entered the grotto and beheld dragon scales and wondrous realms, lush flowers and verdant trees. Returning from Huayang to the grotto’s gate, he found a stone drum, a *xun* in breadth, which resounded with a deep *feng-feng* when struck. From there upward, the path was as smooth as if carved, with stones pressing in on either side, forming a winding passage. In the center, a stone pillar hung inverted, serving as a barrier to the mundane world—hence the name "Passing the Pillar." A small opening like a window led to an inner chamber over a *zhang* wide, where a bottomless circular well could be heard gurgling with water. This was the place where envoys of successive dynasties cast dragon jades.

**Qizhen Grotto**—Located on the Western Heavenly Pillar Ridge before Mount Dadi, three *li* from the palace, also called the Western Grotto. The old gazetteer records that Master Dadi, Du Chen, said to his disciple He Faren: "You should dwell in the Western Grotto, where you may transcend the world and attain perfection." Thus, it was named Qizhen Grotto. The summit is naturally shaped like a treasure lid, its chambers secluded and deep, with stalactites dripping pure water. On the eastern and western terraces above the stone chambers, traces of dragon claws—coiling, grasping, and retracting—remain. If one playfully erases them with a hand, they reappear the next day, revealing the path by which the grotto dragon enters and exits.

On the western terrace, a stone as flat as a chessboard is strewn with white pebbles the size of fists. Stone seats encircle it. Entering the grotto’s gate about three *zhang*, one finds a stone immortal in a reclining posture. Further west beyond the Flowery Canopy, a stone chamber can hold several people.

**Shishi Grotto**—Also called the Hidden Books Grotto or the Eastern Exquisite Grotto, located at the foot of White Deer Mountain before the central peak of Mount Dadi. Within the grotto, three vaults form a *pin*-shaped character, revealing the sky above. A stone beam spans the entrance, beneath which a spring trickles, its waters channeled to sustain over ten residents.

Legend says that Immortal Guo once climbed the mountain to gather herbs and bathed here, giving it the name "Washing Herbs Spring." The prefectural gazetteer records that it was the cultivation site of Heavenly Master Wu. After the Heavenly Master achieved liberation by transformation in Xuancheng, he instructed his disciples to conceal his books and sword here. The grotto contains stone chambers, hence its name.

The *Record of Exemplary Conduct* further states that the Heavenly Master said: "I shall ascend to the Heavenly Pillar Stone Chamber, for the Supreme Lord has designated it as my place of refinement and transformation." Thus, he chose its western foothills, where a stone seat and natural rock door were already prepared. Therefore, not only were his books and sword hidden here, but the Heavenly Master’s true form was also concealed.

According to the *Scripture of Stone Essence and Golden Light*: The methods of soaring at dawn, concealment, spirit records, and sword liberation all involve passing through the Purple Womb of the Great Yin for four hundred years of refinement. What is hidden must eventually emerge. When the time is ripe and the numbers align, its numinous power will manifest of its own accord.

The old gazetteer confirms that the Heavenly Master’s stone chamber indeed has a gaping rock door, which opens as if by truth. On the mountainside lie a stone wine vessel and a stone tea stove, relics of the immortals.

**Baimao Grotto**—Ten *li* southwest of the palace, nestled quietly to the right of the ridge. Records state that a Jin-dynasty man encountered a Daoist in splendid robes and headwear emerging from the grotto. Asked where he came from, the Daoist replied: "I am Master Baimao, long stationed here." Thus, the grotto was named after him.

Its entrance resembles a well. Descending one or two *zhang* by ladder, one reaches level ground, where twenty people may sit in a circle. Crouching further down another two *zhang* or so, one finds the stone where the immortal brewed wine, along with two stone pillars. A crevice above pierces the sky, revealing a realm of extraordinary wonder. However, the mountain is high and the path treacherous, so few ever reach it.

**Mingfeng Grotto**—One *li* outside the palace, beside the path on the mountainside. Though its stone gate is narrow, even a child may enter. Within, the space is as vast as two rooms. A small path to the side leads to an unknown end.

Above flows the **Kang Spring**, its waters chiming with a *ding-dang* melody as they descend into a square pool, never overflowing nor running dry. Elders recount that in the time of the Qian clan, a phoenix came to sing here, hence the grotto’s name. The land was also renamed **Lingfeng Township**.

**Tuilong Grotto** lies in the opposing mountain’s embrace, a hundred paces from Mingfeng Grotto. Towering trees shroud its seclusion; cliffs rise sheer and jagged, plunging several *zhang* deep. In the first year of the Song dynasty’s Huangyou era, a Daoist discovered dragon-shed bones within, teeth and horns intact—thus its name. Records state that five grottoes secretly connect; this is one of them.

**Guilei Grotto** stands five *li* from the palace, half a *li* to the left of **Qizhen Grotto**, serving as its rear gate. It extends over a hundred *chi* deep, its stone walls gleaming smooth. Though its vaulted ceiling is lower than the former grotto, records note it as the immortals’ shortcut for turning their chariots, hence its name **Returning Cloud Grotto**. The entrance spans but a few *chi*; descending a *zhang* or so, the stones shimmer like agate, veined in five colors. Swirling clouds and flying mists plunge straight into a square pool, no deeper than a *chi*, two *chi* wide and three *chi* long. The pool’s base glows white, like piled pearls or carved jade, delightful to behold. Its waters rise and fall, never constant. Descending another ten-odd steps, three white stones resemble gourds. A few steps further, ascending to the left reveals a stone basin, where a trickling spring flows down to fill it—fit for washing. Surrounding stalactites hang like strands of pearls. Turning back to the right and descending fourteen or fifteen steps, the space widens to two *zhang*, where a stone resembles stacked copper coins. The ground is level, able to seat over thirty. As for ancient traces:

*Human affairs shift with the ages,
Yet mountains and rivers remain unchanged.*

Beneath a thousand years of mortal life, the mind roams above a thousand years of antiquity. Ascending Mount Ji, one recalls the wind of washing ears; mourning at Shouyang, one grieves the integrity of starving to death. Profit and harm no longer reach them, echoes and shadows no longer know them—yet even rustic peasants, woodcutters, and herding boys still linger in sorrowful song, their brows furrowed in lament. How much more so for those lofty souls who stand apart from the world with unyielding resolve?

A thousand ages share one principle; ten thousand people share one heart. The ancients are distant, the Nine Springs cannot be revived—yet when one passes by their secluded haunts and beholds their places of rest and roaming, does not the heart swell as if warmed by their very presence?

At Tamed Tiger Crag, the hollowed wood remains unharmed; on Ascension Altar, the cinnabar and tortoise-shell have not yet cooled. The empty mountains hold no one, yet their vastness fills me with sorrow—was this within the power of the men of Jin, or have men of today simply lost the ability?

Traces of the past in these mountains can still be verified, and a few extraordinary tales are appended here:

**Han Palace Altar**
Located before the Great Cleansing Grotto, it was established by Emperor Wu of Han in the third year of the *Yuanfeng* era. Today, its foundations can no longer be discerned.

**Ascension Altar**
According to old records, the Ascension Altar stands atop a peak in the mountains and is also called the Dharma Image Altar. Its upper part is round, corresponding to Heaven; its base is square, corresponding to Earth; and its middle is eight-sided, corresponding to the *Yi* trigrams. Master Xu Yuanzhen, who delved deeply into grotto classics, ascended it and departed as an immortal. At the time, a white deer descended from Heaven to welcome him, hence the central peak is named White Deer Mountain. Today, within a stretch of several *zhang* amid the pines atop the mountain, no grass or trees grow—this is its former site. During the *Zhenghe* era of the Song, auspicious clouds and flute music were still heard there.

**Tamed Tiger Crag**
Situated among sheer cliffs southwest of Palace Mountain, it resembles an enclosed chamber. A path to the south descends from above, then climbs stone steps to reach the spot. Vines and creepers grow thick, and strange birds cry by day—only those of the Dao may dwell here. Of old, Master Guo tamed a tiger here. According to the *Book of Jin*, when Ge Hong and He Youdao visited, they merely gazed upon it in silence, saying nothing before withdrawing with a long whistle. The Tang-era Master Wu of Heaven cherished its legacy and often lingered there, forgetting to return. He inscribed a poem on the crag, now faded with age:

*"In boyhood, Master Guo already held a heart beyond the world.
Leaving worldly affairs at the edge of the wilds, he embraced truth in the deep forest.
In Yuanhe, he moved strange creatures; even fierce beasts heeded his virtuous voice.
Not that he was without feeling—his words were subtle and profound."*

The final line alludes to Master Guo’s exchange with Wen Jiao.

**Immortal’s Trace Crag**
One *li* from the palace, beside the path across the stream, atop a pressing stone. Records state that when the First Emperor of Qin drove the mountains and hills to block the eastern sea, he once commanded ghosts to move them. As the mountain shifted, an immortal rebuked the ghosts, pressing down with his body to pin the stone in place. Today, the impressions of shoulders, a hairpin, and cap remain faintly visible. The traces are warm and lustrous, untouched by moss. Rubbing them for a long while, one detects the fragrance of ancient cassia.

Yang Jie wrote a poem:
*"The First Emperor sought immortality in vain, striving to drive the sea and cast down mountains and stones.
A divine being leaned against them, refusing to let them go, leaving hidden immortal traces before the crag."*

**Coming Worthies Crag**
Located before Green Sandalwood Mountain southeast of the palace, it is hollowed out for several *zhang*, with creeping figs and bamboo shading the encircling stones—an ideal place for rest and roaming. During the *Xining* era of the Song, Su Dongpo, then serving as Prefect of Hangzhou, visited with Cai Zhun, Wu Tianchang, Le Fuguo, Wenren Andao, Kang Zhi, and Zhang Rihua. All wore informal headscarves and carried staffs as they lingered here. Dongpo composed a poem:

*"The High Emperor, pitying the world’s stubbornness, left this jade pavilion among mortals.
Ninefold-locked green mountains are not easily reached; seven men sit in leisure, facing one another.
Beneath the courtyard, flowing springs dance with jade dragons; within the grotto, flying rats and white crows wheel.
Ancient pines and strange stones suit frost-touched temples—no need for golden elixirs to preserve youth bitterly."*

Later generations named the crag *Coming Worthies* and built a pavilion atop it called *Frost-Suited*.

**Stone Chamber**
Master Wu of Heaven of the Tang inscribed characters with his sword here; during the Song, Lu Weizhi and Zhu Miaoxing resided within.

**Clapping Spring**
Beneath the Dragon Shrine within the palace, only three *chi* deep, its waters are clear and cold, fit for drinking. An old poem says:
*"One doubts the three-foot depth—is this not another heaven in a gourd?"*
The spring’s colors shift unpredictably, and with each change, an auspicious event follows. The *Illustrated Classic of Yu Hang* records that when King Wusu of Qian arrived at the palace, a pair of cranes danced above the spring. Clapping to summon them, the cranes alighted as the spring surged forth. When Inspector Chen Yaozuo visited during an inspection, he asked a Daoist the meaning of the spring’s name. The Daoist replied, *"Of old, an immortal clapped, and the spring gushed forth."* The inspector clapped his hands, and the same occurred. An inscription by Master Wu of Heaven reads:
*"Drought and flood do not alter it; its radiance illumines halls and eaves.
Cool in summer, it parts sand and pebbles; warm in winter, it cradles duckweed and algae."*

In the early *Xining* era of the Song, a creature resembling an eel circled the railing, its two eyes like cinnabar. When people struck it with sticks, it plunged into the spring. Soon, dark mist spread, and a great flood surged from the Heavenly Pillar Source, roaring and terrifying, nearly submerging the halls before receding. Some said it was the wrath of a dragon. Today, the spring is encircled with stone, a pavilion built over it, and red railings added—Emperor Gaozong of the Song once drew water from it.

**Bright Star Pool**
According to the *Illustrated Classic of Yu Hang*, it lies 120 *bu* east of the county, with a circumference of 150 *bu*, south of the stream’s embankment. In every dynasty, envoys casting dragon tablets into the Heavenly Pillar Great Cleansing Grotto first offered sacrifices at Bright Star Pool. The *Nine Regions Record* states that this was also the custom in ancient Yu Hang. Elders say that once, someone saw a star shining brilliantly at midday, hence the name. Below the stream lie many deep pools, formed by rushing waters. West of the new weir, the third pool is the deepest—clear and expansive.

Elders recount that south of the pool, beside the road, once stood a Daoist abode—its ruins still remain. Today, the land belongs to this abbey, which is also named Bright Star.

**Medicinal Garden**
Located below the Frost-Welcoming Pavilion at Laixian Crag, where Master Xiahou once cultivated herbs. Rows of lingzhi mushrooms and groves of medicinal trees flourished here, with every variety of healing plant in abundance. He regularly dispensed medicine in the bustling market, giving according to each person’s need. One day, a woodcutter heard a great howling within the garden. Peering through the fence, he saw the Master wielding a whip, riding a beast that resembled a tiger yet was not—moving swift as the wind as it vanished into the eastern mountains. Today, the four mountains yield over sixty kinds of medicinal herbs, and the garden’s traces remain.

**Hall of Master Ye**
The old gazetteer records that it stood outside the mountain gate, built by the Master through the labor of spirits and gods. Its construction was grand and ingenious, unlike the work of ordinary craftsmen. During the Kaiyuan era, the Master lectured here on the *Dao De Jing*, the *Scripture of Salvation*, and other scriptures, as divine flowers and sacred cranes descended from the heavens. Scholars and recluses from Wu and Yue gathered to listen, all gaining insight, and over three hundred wished to join his disciples. He taught them to relieve the orphaned and impoverished, to feel gratitude for the nurturing heavens and earth, to honor loyalty to rulers and filial piety to parents, to value human life, to refine body and mind, and to renounce extravagance—these were the foundations of the Daoist tradition. Ravaged by war and fire, no trace of the hall remains. It has since been relocated within the abbey as the Hall of Teachings.

**Thatched Hall**

The Hall was established by the Qian family. In the second year of Jingyou during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang, King Wusu honored Master Qiu of Juxian as its resident. Thereafter, he would ascend the mountain every ten days to seek the Dao. On each of the Three Primes, he opened the altar to transmit the teachings, and the register was named the Upper Clarity Altar. Even the Imperial Censor-in-Chief Luo Yin entered his chamber to receive instruction. Surrounding the hall were rows of cloud chambers, serving as dwellings for the disciples and followers. At dawn and dusk, they entered the chamber, and upon retreat, they would close their doors. Below, some held scriptures, some discoursed on the Dao, and others refined their spirits and cultivated perfection, each attaining their respective goals. Today, the Upper Clarity lineage of the abbey traces its origins to this place.

**Daylight Tower**
Also called the Tower of Hanging Signs, it was the residence of the Heavenly Master. In his youth, the Heavenly Master was fond of classics and histories, and his writings were ceaseless, with scrolls and volumes piled high around him. By day, he gathered the essence of the sun, and by night, he drank the spirit of the moon, ascending to the supreme Dao of purple script on vessels. On the eastern and western walls, small apertures were set, just large enough to frame a face—these were the portals for gathering and refinement. Bai Yuanjian composed a poem about it. Its site now lies within the abbey, serving as the lineage of refined contemplation.

**Southern Mound**
This is also the present site of the abbey. When Master Xu of True Reality resided on Mount Da Ye north of the palace, he later ascended in transcendence. Forewarning his confidants at Southern Mound, he said, "Tomorrow, I shall ascend to audience with the Jade Emperor." On the appointed day, as they gazed north from the mound, they indeed saw colorful clouds filling the sky, and the True Master riding a white deer, slowly ascending. Thus, this place was named Southern Mound. Today, it has become a separate lineage.

The Daoist Wang Jie of the Seven Min wrote:
*Gone like a drifting crane in search of truth,*
*The wanderer returns, sighing anew at the scene.*
*In Xu Mai’s forest, the cinnabar cauldron gleams,*
*On Guo Wen’s mountain, white clouds run deep.*
*The affairs of Southern Mound are ancient, no longer as before,*
*The return to Northern Ridge remains unfulfilled to this day.*
*With boundless intent for the Jade Capital, hold fast,*
*And with meritorious deeds, nurture the lofty summit.*

**Howling Pavilion**
Located five *li* south of Yu Hang County.

In the Jin dynasty, the True Master Guo resided on Great Cleansing Mountain. He often went to the market to sell medicine, accompanied by a tiger that he had tamed to lie here. Upon returning late, the tiger would howl, hence the name Howling Pavilion. Today, the strange rocks in the ravine below the mountain and the murmuring streams remain.

**Gathering Immortals Pavilion**
According to old records, its foundation is the breast of Heavenly Pillar Peak, offering a clear and splendid view overlooking the palace precincts. Master Xuantong built the pavilion here to harness the qi. During the Qianning era, many heard the sound of jade pendants and detected an unusual fragrance wafting from the pavilion. They rushed to report this to the master, who said: "The immortals of the grotto-heaven are paying homage to the Northern Asterism. Tonight, the hundred spirits are listening to the lecture, and the great ritual has been invoked, arriving at this pavilion." Thus, it was named Gathering Immortals. Chancellor Chen Yaosou wrote a poem:
*Ancient cypresses spread like alchemical banners,*
*Colorful clouds drift with fragrance at Gathering Immortals Pavilion.*

**Auspicious Radiance Pavilion**
Located at the entrance of Great Cleansing Grotto, when King Wusu of the Qian state was still obscure, he pointed to a massive rock outside and said: "If I attain wealth and nobility one day, I shall build a pavilion to cover this stone." Once he rose to power, he constructed the pavilion with great splendor. Later, woodcutters beneath the pavilion witnessed immortals playing chess above, but upon approaching, they vanished. In the fifth year of Xiangfu, envoys Bai and Chen, along with local officials, arrived. The sky was perfectly clear, without the slightest haze. As they lit incense, a five-colored cloud suddenly emerged from the grotto, ascending straight to the heavens and spreading below to blanket the forests and foothills. The feather-clad attendants and their mounts were enveloped in the cloud, as if immortals were paying homage to the Jade Capital. After several moments, the cloud dispersed. The event was reported to the throne, and the pavilion was named Auspicious Radiance. Today, the plaque reads *Great Cleansing Grotto-Heaven*.

**Illuminating Hall**
Situated to the left of the Supreme Heaven Hall, Emperor Gaozong of the Song dynasty stayed here, taking his meals and rest. The bed and desk remain in the rear tower, offering an unobstructed view of the mountains.

**Divine Response Bell**
According to old records, in the fourth year of the Dali era of the Tang dynasty, Feiyan in Taizhou suffered a severe drought. Prayers went unanswered, so they supplicated at the Great Cleansing Grotto in Hangzhou. After the rains came, the earth deity appeared in a dream to the prefect, saying: "Cast a golden bell to repay the favor." The prefect complied. By the Xuanhe era of the Song dynasty, over 360 years later, the bell was destroyed in a fire. In the eighth year of Shaoxing, Daoist Zhou Xiji and others gathered the fragments, intending to recast it. The deity declared: "It will only succeed if forged in its original location." Reluctantly, they complied, and the bell was completed in the same year. The inscription on the left side of Red City reads:
*Broken by fate, not by fire;*
*Completed by the divine, not by man.*
*Forged here, used there,*
*Blessing our land without end—*
*Hence its name, Divine Response Bell.*

**Divine Radiance of the Western Grotto**
In the Xinmao year of the Shaoding era of the Song dynasty, Yang Gongbocha, a descendant of Prince Tai of Wu, traveled to Resting Truth Grotto. As he lit a torch and looked up, a divine radiance suddenly emanated from the layered terrace above—half azure, half white—slowly ascending like a full moon before eventually fading. Astonished, he left a poem on the mountain. The immortal Xuanzi of the Eastern Terrace wrote:
*In the full moon’s radiance, the great thousand worlds appear.*
Daoist Wang Siming once erected a stone to commemorate the event.

**Pine-Flower Stones**
There were originally two, located before the Ring of Jade Hall, but they no longer exist.

**Rejuvenated Tree**
The *Illustrated Record of Yu Hang* states that outside the palace stood a massive *li* tree, said to have been planted by Master Wu of the Tian lineage in the first year of Xianheng during the Tang dynasty. In the first year of Xiangfu, it withered inexplicably, remaining so for fifteen years. In the Renzi year of Xiangfu, it flourished again. Transport Commissioner Chen Yaozuo marveled at this and presented an illustrated report to the throne, along with accounts of five-colored clouds and a spring gushing from the earth. An imperial edict soon followed, ordering a grand ritual to honor the divine marvel, and the name of the abbey was changed to Grotto Radiance. Later, in the third year of Xining, during the fifth month, a violent storm with thunder erupted one night, and the tree vanished without a trace. People believed it had transformed into a spirit.

**Boneless Bamboo**
The mountains surrounding the abbey span a hundred *li* and are abundant with clumping bamboo. Long ago, when the True Master Xu Yuanyou of the Jin dynasty ascended, he told his disciples: "I possess ten doses of golden elixir. Your cultivation is not yet complete, so you cannot consume it hastily. I have hidden it beneath the boneless bamboo in the mountains. Those with karmic affinity will encounter it in the future." Later, laborers gathering firewood sometimes brought back bamboo, and upon cooking, they would find the elixir, though no boneless bamboo was seen when collected. Some curious individuals searched the secluded areas for years but never found it. For it was a treasure hidden by immortals, attainable only by those with predestined affinity.

**Praying Phoenixes**
Only two of these birds exist, nesting deep within the trees. They call through the night until dawn, their cries resembling the sound of prayers. Yet when people approach, they flee, so no one has ever identified them.

**Stone Incense Tripod**
When Academician Chen Yaozuo of the Song dynasty was appointed to Wai Tai, he said to Daoist Feng Dezhi: "I once dreamed of wandering a famous mountain, where immortals used a tripod to refine elixirs. How could I dare hope for such a thing?" Feng replied: "The academician is destined for greatness, your name already inscribed in the immortal registers. Why cling to worldly wealth and nobility?" Later, Chen indeed rose to prominence and had two massive purple stone tripods crafted, placing them in Auspicious Radiance Pavilion. One bore the inscription:
*The tripod’s form rises like smoke from a gourd,*
*The body’s essence nurtures the primordial through emptiness.*
*Its use lies in non-use,*
*Spontaneous and natural.*
*Tripod and man alike—*
*This is the Dao.*

The other inscription read:
*Lofty mountains pierce the clouds,*
*Deep grottoes house the true.*
*In a flash of phoenix and crane,*
*A hundred springs pass in awe.*
*How can one attain such a place?*
*By preserving radiance and treasuring the spirit.*

**Four-Mountain Boundary Pines**
In the third year of the Chunxi era of the Song dynasty, Prefect Zhang Juzhong planted pines on all the hills and mounds of the abbey that bordered civilian land, personally overseeing the work. Once completed, during spring and autumn, he would lead his successors up the mountain to recognize the boundaries. Today, these pines on the four mountains resemble coiled dragons, standing in dense formation, each over a *zhang* in girth.

The merit of its initial cultivation and planting must not be forgotten.

**Poem: Dream Journey**
In the *Jiwei* year of the Yuanfeng era of the Song dynasty, Minister Zhao Qinxian (Pu) governed Qiantang and submitted a memorial to retire. In the *Jiazi* year, during the eighth month, he suddenly came to wander the mountain. He said to the Daoist Shen Riyi: "Recently, I dreamed of entering a true realm—palaces and towers soared in grandeur, and several Daoists approached me. When I asked where this was, they replied: 'This is the Dongxiao Abbey.' Upon waking, I pondered it: though I have twice governed this prefecture, I have never been here. Thus, I braved the summer heat to come." Now, beholding the springs, rocks, and pavilions, he found them no different from what he had seen in his dream. Could it be that the immortals and sages had beckoned him? His poem reads:

*In the dragon’s drought, a safe refuge,*
*The spring’s source, cool to the touch.*
*Far from the red dust of men,*
*In broad daylight, the world endures.*
*My lot is the quiet and still—*
*Who would chase profit and fame?*
*Do not mock the dream’s visions,*
*For now I walk the Dongxiao’s way.*

**Calligraphy of Minister Chen Wenhui**
In the *Renzi* year of the Xiangfu era of the Song dynasty, Minister Chen Wenhui (Yaozuo), while overseeing the transport bureau, submitted a memorial to renovate the abbey’s halls and petitioned for a change in its official name. By imperial decree, he was ordered to inscribe the six characters *Quanzhou Dongxiao Zhi Gong* ("Abbey of the Dongxiao in Quanzhou").

**Recitation of the *Scripture of Salvation***
The *Yuhang Illustrated Gazetteer* records that the abbey’s presiding Daoist recited the *Scripture of Salvation*, which often yielded extraordinary efficacy. Each time he chanted it by the Dragon Pool beside his residence, one day an old man emerged from the pool and knelt, saying: "This disciple is the Dragon King. Every time I hear the scripture, I am filled with reverence. Today, I humbly make a request. Whenever the master approaches the pool, the aquatic creatures all rise in respect without ceasing, which unsettles me. I wish the master would sit in quiet seclusion within the hall to continue his daily recitations, so that the spirits of the hundred numina may rest." That day, he presented two *jin* of fresh milk to offer during the vegetarian feast, and the Daoist agreed. The next morning, the kitchen attendant reported that the table had been set with pure, fresh milk, its source unknown. It weighed precisely two *jin*, and this became a daily occurrence. After several years, it suddenly failed to appear for many days. The Daoist grew suspicious and happened to visit the waterside, where he again saw the old man, who said: "Milk is a worldly thing, and this disciple has none. Though I am but a local earth spirit, I can secretly seize it from those in the world who deceive others for profit. Nearby, a merchant named Dong Qi often tampered with his steelyard, passing fourteen ounces as a *jin*. Thus, I took from him. Now, he is gone, and his father runs the shop, never cheating for gain—so I cannot take from him. This is not a breach of our agreement." The Daoist sighed in admiration and often proclaimed this story in the villages, guiding people toward goodness. The elders of the region still speak of it today, though they have forgotten the Daoist’s name and the exact date.

**Preface to the Stele Record of Mount Tianzhu**
**Record of the Tianzhu Abbey**

The Tianzhu Abbey takes its name from the mountain. According to traditional accounts, the heavens are upheld by eight pillars, three of which stand within China—one in Shuzhou, two in Shouyang, and the present one here in Yuhang. Furthermore, the Daoist scriptures state that within the realm of heaven and earth lie ten great grotto-heavens and thirty-six lesser grotto-heavens, arranged like the feudal domains, commanderies, and counties of a state, each subordinate to the next. Within these grotto-heavens, the sun and moon shed their refined essences, golden halls and jade chambers arise, and immortal officials preside, examining fortune and misfortune.

This Mount Tianzhu is the very *Great Grotto-Heaven of Great Purity* spoken of in the *Declarations of the Perfected*. Within it, hidden passageways secretly connect to Huayang and Linwu, where one may ride the wind and command the light, arriving and departing in an instant. The true traces are profound and obscure, beyond the measure of the mundane world. Moreover, south of the great river, this land spans the domains of Wu and Yue. Its peaks to the west press against the dragon-source of the Two Celestial Eyes, then link to the misty sleeves of Stone Mirror Peak. To the east, it cradles the distant currents of the Zhe River, combining the purity of waters and the elegance of mountains, with passage to the great sea and the lands beyond. Elsewhere, it is also called East Tianmu, West Tianmu, and Tianzhu, as if it lifts its azure shores to the vault of heaven, thrusts its sheer cliffs into the clouds, and claims the name of heaven to mark its singular majesty.

When one ascends to gaze afar, a thousand crags and ten thousand ravines pile in golden and jade layers, coiled like dragons and crouched like tigers. The land’s numinous essence nurtures generation after generation of extraordinary figures—if not the convergence of mountain beauty and earthly spirit, what else could achieve this?

Among them, Mount Tianzhu is blessed with pure winds and harmonious *qi*, fertile soil and limpid springs. Venomous snakes do not strike, and fierce beasts grow docile. Since Emperor Wu of Han fervently sought immortals and revealed divine traces, an official altar was established at the grotto’s mouth, where successive dynasties performed prayers and exorcisms. In the Eastern Jin, Master Guo Wenju attained the Dao of flight and transformation, dwelling in seclusion on this mountain. Tigers came to him in submission, as recorded in the histories. Beside his humble hut, he planted three pines—now bending like rainbows and soaring like phoenixes, their verdant splendor enduring for a thousand years—still standing before the abbey’s hall.

When the Great Tang founded its dynasty, it revered the Mysterious Origin Emperor as its progenitor, honoring the profound Dao and expanding its roots. The Heavenly August Emperor, who grasped the charts and ruled the realm, sought talismans and explored omens. Thus, Master Pan Hongyan, who had delved into the true source, was dispatched to search for sacred realms. In the first year of *Hongdao*, he established the Tianzhu Abbey. At its center, a thousand paces in each direction were walled off, forbidding woodcutting to preserve the *Forest of Longevity*. Emperor Zhongzong, inheriting the jade lineage and further opening the gates of mystery, bestowed upon the abbey a manor to provide for incense and lamps. Thereafter, its terraces and halls seemed not the work of human hands, its corridors and railings as if conjured by transformation. The altar of stars and the steps of the moon took form in miniature.

Here, recluses in coarse robes and lofty scholars leaning on wutong trees savored the taste of limpid springs and rested in the shade of green creepers. Master Ye of the Celestial Law, Fashan; Master Zhu, Junxu; Master Wu of the Celestial Law, Jun; Master Qi of the Celestial Law; Master Sima of the Celestial Law, Chengzhen; and Master Xiahou of the Celestial Law, Ziyun—all followed one another to the mountain’s roots, dwelling beyond the realm of things. Their bones ascended golden locks, their names crowned the jade registers. They emerged as teachers to emperors and kings, then returned as leaders of immortals. Their golden inscriptions marked the abbey’s eaves, their verdant fame flowing through the ages. These luminous deeds remain, and need not be recounted in full.

Other features—the convergence of three springs, the twin stones opening like doors, the medicinal gardens and new ponds, the ancient altars and libraries—each bears its own inscription and title, sufficient to cast enduring radiance.

Recently, I have been repeatedly entrusted by the sagely court with governance over Fujian, holding the seals of vast territories and commanding the mountains and rivers of Goujian’s legacy. My honors rival those of Xiao and Cao, my glory surpasses that of Hun and Guo. My heart has long cherished this place, so near to my homeland, and I have long admired the true wind, learning the details of its past.

However, when the abbey was first established, it faced south. Later, Master Zhu surveyed the terrain and altered its orientation to the north. Though this followed the mountain’s contours, the grotto’s entrance became skewed. The grotto’s head is yin, its back yang—an unsuitable site for a Daoist abbey, as it cannot harmonize with the left and right. The ridges conflict with the land’s configuration, turning away from the grotto’s gate and disrupting the hundred spirits. The clear spring now assaults the White Tiger, causing the abbey’s decline and making it difficult to retain worthy and capable masters. All this stems from the main hall’s ill-fated position, where water strikes against its back.

In the second year of *Qianning*, I toured the mountain’s origins and wandered through its grotto-palaces. Moved to repay the profound virtue of the ninefold sagely throne and to establish a court of blessings for the three armies and the hundred clans, I performed purification rites. Then, I sought the principles of geomancy and examined the main hall’s foundation, finding no means of revitalization. The Daoist community struggled in poverty, unable to provide incense and lamps for the two seasonal rites, let alone conduct annual ceremonies.

Thus, I submitted a forthright memorial to the sagely wisdom, requesting that the Shangqing Daoist Wenqiu Fangyuan and over thirty fellow Daoists be appointed to oversee the teachings. Each spring and autumn, and in all four seasons, they would perform rites for the state. I personally oversaw the construction of halls and the relocation of the foundation. The mountain’s terrain featured three peaks and two breasts, with the alchemical kiln’s remains of Master Xu Mai still present. We leveled the high and filled the low, changing the orientation to *jia*—the first of the five tones’ directions—and augmented the breast-like hills to serve as the main support.

Within a year or two, the masters of the law received twofold imperial favor, and the Daoist leaders flourished. The abbey’s provisions were fully restored. Blue oxen and white deer could slumber beneath the jade trees’ shade, while rainbow banners and cloud canopies never ceased above the star altar. Was this not the revival of the profound wind through the mountain’s transformation?

Later, I submitted another memorial to recommend Master Wenqiu’s Daoist practice. The sagely emperor, delighting in the flourishing of the immortal source and the radiance of the true teaching, wished to wander the jade waters in spirit and revisit Huaxu in dreams. Desiring to propagate the teaching of non-action and rejoicing in the presence of a man of the Dao, he bestowed upon him the dharma name *Master of Wondrous Existence* and conferred upon him the robes of office.

Though those who gird cold blades with hempen cords disdain worldly honor, within the gate of the Dharma Bridge that exhorts to goodness, what harm in resplendence? Next among the accomplished Daoist masters was Zheng Maozhang, born in the Divine Continent and long dwelling upon a famed peak. His profound mechanism aligned in perfect accord, and he bore his scripture case to arrive in full. By a fortunate twist of fate, he was received by the square-pupiled sovereign, ever lingering amid the transforming bamboo, and served as deputy to *Master of Wondrous Existence*, jointly conducting the fasts and Offerings of the Three Primes and Eight Festivals. As blessings were extended to the ancestral peach, grace and favor deeply permeated the military and common folk. Soon a special memorial was submitted, and by the emperor’s boundless grace, he was further bestowed with the purple robes and continued his incense offerings here.

Within the great hall were sculpted the Heavenly Worthy and Perfected, the Dragon and Tiger Lords, with attendants ever in full array. Next, a separate Hall of Refined Contemplation for the Supreme Clarity was established as a place for invoking the Perfected and reciting the Dao. Kitchens and halls were built, along with places for arranging tripods and striking bells. Gateways, corridors, and chambers—all were renewed without exception. Heavenly winds often stirred the courtyard steps, and earthly breezes frequently whispered through windows and doors. Moreover, the emperor’s own calligraphy adorned the temple plaque, dazzling in its accomplishment.

Yet this was no boast of eight-limbed mastery, but rather the esteem of establishing an enduring aspiration. *Master of Wondrous Existence*, Lüqiu Jun, possessed the marvelous insight of lingzhi and the rare distinction of the white crane. His virtue was born amid the starry constellations, and he roamed the numinous caverns wreathed in rainbow mists. His morning devotions were earnest and reverent, his observance of precepts and rituals exacting. Truly, he was a paragon of the Purple Palace and a chief minister of the Clear Capital.

As for the site of divine descent, it was none other than Mount Tianzhu in Shuzhou. With a wanderer’s resolve, he trod its layered heights, forgetting weariness. From the front of Celestial Pillar Peak to its base, he paused to cultivate, examining its tally of signs. Surely this was no empty endeavor—thus this act of restoration and veneration, truly a joint search and revelation.

As the saying goes, the Dao is nowhere absent, and each age has its fitting person. From the time of Peng and Ji until the work’s completion, the immortal realm’s finest vistas were fully arrayed, and the true wind of the Sagely Ancestor was made manifest. Thereupon, a painted scroll was prepared, sealed, and presented as tribute.

On the twenty-seventh day of the eleventh month of the second year of Guanghua, an imperial rescript graciously bestowed funds, decreeing: "We have reviewed the memorial presenting the illustrated record of the reconstruction of Mount Tianzhu Abbey. All is understood. Our dynasty inherits the blessed source of the immortals, roaming the realm of the Dao. Throughout the Two Heavens, numinous traces abound. Yet since the repeated onset of warfare, many foundations have been ruined. How much more so in this secluded and distant place, where repair and construction were long neglected? You have consulted the local gazetteers, knowing that successive sagely rulers revered and patronized this site, personally visiting its finest vistas. Now, restoring the immortal abode and selecting the most devout among the faithful to earnestly prepare the rites of incense offerings, you hope to receive the profound favor that has long ensured our prosperity. This is not merely a matter of embellishing a place of good works, but also a testament to your devotion to the sovereign. Having laid out your memorial and perused it again and again, We cannot but praise and admire it endlessly. Let this be known to you."

Amidst winter’s chill, We trust you remain in good health. Our written instructions have been brief.

Now, consider this: the earth brings forth numinous mounds, and heaven opens grotto-palaces. Before the Three Sovereigns, true sages were not few—none but rode the void and trod the luminous, emerging from being and entering non-being. Though some may be recorded in hearsay, their names and identities remain unknown. Yet each presides over a grotto-heaven, and the Great Purification Grotto is one among them.

The Heavenly Pillar Abbey has, from the Jin and Han dynasties through the Tang, been a place where those who cultivate the true Dao have followed in one another’s pure footsteps. Amid the turmoil of the four quarters, it offered a realm of rare tranquility and mystery. Today, the immortal palace stands tall as a mountain, and lofty Daoists gather like clouds. The six periods of the day see no lapse in the sounding of bells and chimes, nor do the eight seasonal festivals lack their proper fasts and rites. Thus does it safeguard the radiant mandate of the state and bring blessings to the people of the two prefectures.

We now govern the mountains and rivers of Wu and Yue, holding office of the highest rank. Above, We serve the ancestral altars; below, We care for the military and the people. All reverently look to the divine and follow the great Dao. In this era of sagely rule, the four seas turn in devotion. Humbly entrusted with the southeast, We have been enfeoffed as a meritorious minister and granted a golden charter. Our ancestral home is now clad in brocade, and We hold the oil-canopied standards of both the civil and military Dao. Above, We receive the favor of the One Ruler’s reliance; next, We acknowledge the protective power of the true and orthodox. The Most Supreme and Sagely Primordial, revered for bestowing blessings and generating life, embodies the true statutes of the great Dao—effortless transformation. That We have attained this in Our lifetime is fitting to inscribe upon enduring stone, that later worthies may know.

Recorded on the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the third year of Guanghua.

**Inscription for the Heavenly Pillar Abbey Stele**

The Grand Historian once said: within the vast wilderness, there are five thousand renowned mountains. In China, the Five Peaks serve as guardians, while Mount Luofu, Mount Kuocang, and ten others act as their lieutenants. The rest cannot be enumerated in full.

The name "Heavenly Pillar" is shared by three peaks: Mount Qian, Mount Huo, and this one. For below, it anchors the earth’s axis; above, it supports heaven’s pivot; and within, it encloses a grotto-palace. Is it merely a treasure-house of gold and jade, prized by immortals? It also stirs clouds and rain, nourishing the myriad things.

Ten *li* from the outskirts of Yu Hang, along the Yi Stream, one disembarks and heads south. Playing with the murmuring waters, entering the towering peaks, the secluded path winds deep—barely a thousand paces—when suddenly the cliffs recede, embracing a valley. Here, the pure abbey is established.

Inquiring among the knowledgeable and consulting the veritable records, We learn that the eminent recluse Guo Wenju once made his retreat here, dwelling among the cloud-forests, never to return. His virtue extended even to beasts, and fierce creatures grew docile in his presence. The *Book of Jin: Biographies of Recluses* records this in full, and it may be briefly recounted. After Master Guo vanished into the hidden and ascended, his shrine was built here.

In the first year of Hongdao of Our Tang, the immortal traces were expanded, and the Heavenly Pillar Abbey was established. Five grottoes lie adjacent, and the one bearing a name is called the Great Purification. Though its depths are fathomless, it is said to secretly connect with the Dark Palace of the Supreme Thearch through the Grotto of the Forest Chamber and Mount Huayang.

Here flow three springs—two for rinsing, one for overflowing—distinct sources merging into one stream, unchanging in drought or flood. Gathered into a winding pool, they reflect the halls and eaves. In summer, their chill reveals every grain of sand; in winter, their warmth nurtures duckweed and algae. To drink from them after rinsing, to pillow one’s arm upon them—joy resides therein.

The soil knows no marsh, the wind no biting gales. Thus, those who dwell here find their hearts at ease and their years prolonged. The winding paths and secluded recesses, the pure qi and beautiful surroundings—tigers do not strike, snakes do not sting, how much less would they harm humans?

In the early Zhenguan era, there was Master Xu, named Mai, who embraced the Dao and sought seclusion. Though summoned repeatedly, he never stirred. Later, Daoists Zhang Zheng, Ye Fashan, Zhu Junxu, Sima Ziwei, Ji Qi, and Xiahou Ziyun—all eminent figures—some wandered here, some resided, spending years without thought of return.

During the Baoying era, when the multitudes swarmed like ants and the city was reduced to smoldering ashes, this place alone remained untouched. Without the support of divine spirits, how could it have endured?

Prefect Xiangli Zao and Magistrate Fan Xi, their governance harmonious and policies accomplished, ruled without severity yet brought order. The people, drawn by their virtue, restored their livelihoods. Alongside the recluse Li Xuanqing, We delight in this blessed land—where else would We go? Fearing that future gentlemen might not know its origins, We have carved this to mark the steadfast stone.

Recorded on the fifteenth day of the first month in the thirteenth year of Dali by Wu Jun, Daoist of the Central Peak.

**Inscription for the New Pond of the Kitchen Courtyard**

That which meets with a knowing friend finds use—not only among humans, but even among things.

Originally, the kitchen courtyard’s pond, fed by residual moisture, aided the hall, its waters extending only a few paces to provide for cooking and washing. Magistrate Fan Xi of Shunyang, though entangled in worldly affairs, longed for the distant and open. During his days of rest, he sought the Dao among the mountains and forests. Observing the natural contours of a pond and its obstructed channels, he commanded the Daoist clergy to expand its bounds. They quarried stone to line its edges, gathered streams to deepen it, and suddenly, clear ripples stilled, autumn’s shadows filling the courtyard. Those who tend the hearths need no servants to fetch water; those who draw it bear no labor of dipping. Without contrivance, its benefits abound—this pond has truly met its knowing friend.

Master Fan’s achievement lies in this: stillness deepens the Dao, and seclusion invigorates the spirit. We, along with Master Wu the Heavenly Teacher, have roamed the grotto-palaces, gazing upon this place morning and evening. It polishes the heart and gall, dispelling dullness and obscurity. If a matter pleases the heart, then ascending Mount Gusu or gazing upon the Five Lakes is no different.

Thus, utilizing the remaining space on the stele, we carve these words in stone to commemorate it, much like the poets’ verses on the flowing spring.

In the fifth year of the Dali era, during the cyclical year *gui-mao* and on the first day of the eighth month, the scholar Li Xuanqing recorded this.

**The Great Bell’s Record**

When the Sagely Son of Heaven holds the tally and governs the realm, revering Heaven and cherishing the people, should the rains or sunshine falter, he prays at the sacred peaks, and his devotion is everywhere met with response. Among the places where numinous efficacy quietly manifests, none surpasses the Great Scouring of Hangzhou. This mountain, dwelling among the thirty-six grotto-heavens, is the Heavenly Pillar Blessed Land, a mere three stages from the imperial capital, and has been venerated at court for years. Though its palaces were grand and majestic, it lacked a great bell. A memorial was submitted, and the throne, considering how to manifest reverence and display its numinosity, issued an edict in the *ji-chou* year of the Shaoding era, during the ailing moon on the *ding-hai* day, commanding its casting. By the mid-autumn *ji-wei* day, it was completed.

Mountains and rivers stand in flow and stillness, clouds and mists emerge and vanish—this is how the luminous spirits enact the work of transformation and bestow beneficent blessings. A rainbow canopy spans the sky, and the great sound pierces the heavens—this is how the Sagely Son of Heaven stabilizes the famous mountains and illuminates his grand achievements. When spirits reveal their manifest works, and the throne offers imperial recompense, can such a momentous occasion in this hallowed precinct go unrecorded?

Upon consulting the archives, we find that in the Dali era of the Tang, there was a Divine Response Bell in Huangyan of Taizhou. When prayers for drought were offered, the people tested its resonance to foretell clear skies or rain. Later, it was destroyed by fire, its sound no longer matching its former glory. During the Kaixi era, the frontier general Bi encountered it again by the Huai and Si rivers, and the old bell of Jingling was recovered. Minister Huang Lu sought to restore it to the Great Scouring, and it was duly installed. Yet all things decay with time, and when decline reaches its limit, renewal must follow. The replacement of the old and establishment of the new must align with the times and respond to destiny.

Once the imperial command was issued, funds were drawn from the inner treasury. The finest craftsmen of the realm were selected, and ordination certificates were bestowed to cover the expenses. Pure metal was melted to perfect its quality. With a single strike, the great instrument was completed. Its form was neither extravagant nor meager, neither too thick nor too thin. Its sound was neither stony nor clanging, neither muffled nor oppressive.

When the bell was cast, the tower was also expanded—was this not the convergence of timely destiny? The court minister Liu Shiheng, entrusted with the task, meticulously planned and executed every detail, presenting illustrations to the throne. The imperial countenance beamed with joy—how magnificent! The Sagely Son of Heaven’s grace toward the famous mountains, paired with the former dynasty’s grants of land and imperial visits, will endure without end.

That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the vessel. The bell is a vessel, yet the Dao resides within it. If one can perpetuate the Dao through it, then errors and conflicts will dissolve, purity and harmony will be preserved, inner illumination and outer stillness will be attained, and through profound effort, one may traverse the hidden paths of Huayang, attend the imperial excursions in the Moon Palace, tame fierce beasts before the cliffs, or conceal the golden elixir beneath the thatch. Naturally, mountains and rivers will present auspicious signs, numinous beings will offer blessings, phoenixes will sing on high ridges, dragons will shed their skins in secluded caves, clear springs will bubble from wells, and propitious lights will illuminate the heavens. Such is the saying, “Where the land is numinous, extraordinary people emerge.” Could it be that such wonders existed only in the past and not today?

If not, then cultivate stillness of spirit and few desires, embody the Dao, and refine the true. Perhaps then the virtuous will multiply, auspicious omens will naturally respond, rain may be entreated, and sunshine may be prayed for—all without failing the court’s reverent devotion.

As for hearing its toll at dawn and dusk, offering due reverence in black robes, praying for the emperor’s longevity and the preservation of the imperial legacy—such that the grotto-heaven and blessed land endure forever—these need no further elaboration.

**Record of the Hall of Extended Teachings**

When Pangu opened the cosmos, Heaven formed first and Earth stabilized later. Thus, of the three pillars that support the heavens at the eight extremities, the one north of Mount Buzhou may be set aside. Only to the east of Mount Ji and south of Mount Hang do the accumulated qi gather thickly, where twin pillars stand. As they reach upward to the chambers of the Grand Tenuity, they are called the Grotto-Heaven; as they conceal the Three Luminaries and Three Roots within, they are called the Heavenly Pillar.

The Daoist tradition delights in speaking of Heaven and the Emperor, never pairing them with Earth, for the sustaining and governing power resides above, while Earth merely bears it. The Grotto of Cloudy Dawn was once named the Abbey of the Heavenly Pillar, and the Hall of Extended Teachings is where the Dao flows forth from the Heavenly Pillar’s nurturing breast.

Originally, the hall stood beyond the great gate. Those who transmitted its history said: “Its construction was divinely wrought, unlike the dwellings of human craft.” Yet this remains uncertain. After it was destroyed by war, it was rebuilt behind the main hall. Later, in the Shaoxing era, its proximity was established; in the Kaixi era, its structures were adorned; and in the Duanping era, its foundations were raised. The hall is now spacious and bright, its pillars broad and unobstructed. Rainbow beams embrace the roof, and yang-horse rafters support the eaves.

Behind the hall, layered stones form the Coughing Spring, where the Pavilion of Gathered Immortals stands. Ascending the balustraded steps leads to the Abbot’s Chamber. How vast is this grand edifice—truly a place to discourse on the Primordial Unity and debate the Yellow Emperor and Shun!

Moreover, our Emperor Gaozong once personally inscribed the *Scripture of Salvation* to consecrate this sanctuary of purity. Emperor Xiaozong composed the *Ancient Pines by the Stream* to honor the ageless Dao. Jade calligraphy adorned the halls of the late emperor, and golden coins were bestowed by the benevolent empress. Now, the reigning emperor has commanded the Perfected Master Chongmiao to oversee this endeavor. How flourishing is the succession of sagely rulers in cultivating the Dao and venerating the teachings!

No sooner was the hall completed than Master Chongmiao ascended in transcendence. His disciple Sun Chudao, along with the abbey’s supervisor Da Nian and Da Qin, recounted the master’s aspirations and compiled its origins, seeking a record from Wu Yong of Tongchuan.

Wu Yong said: “Do you understand what is meant by the hall? Does it exist because of the teachings, or do the teachings exist because of the hall? When the hall was in disrepair, were the teachings also in disrepair? Now that the hall is renewed, are the teachings also renewed? I say to you: the hall may be built or destroyed, but the teachings know no old or new. What the immortals and sages value is the teachings alone. Yet the sage teaches through embodiment, while the perfected one listens with the spirit. Teaching through embodiment avoids the allure of florid doctrines; listening with the spirit avoids chasing after shallow words.”

Now, in constructing a palace of one *mu* and building chambers within enclosing walls, we have labored to hew rough timber and plaster with firm thatch, striving for splendor in its completion. Yet the body possesses its Jade Hut, the heart its Crimson Palace, the spleen its Yellow Chamber, the lungs their Luminous Court, the face its Vermilion Abode, the ears their Three Gates, the throat its Twelve-Storied Tower, the brows their Purple Portal and Azure Chamber, and the seven apertures their Golden Locks and Jade Keys—all these are the very halls within oneself, yet one fails to perceive their subtlety.

Pointing to the Three Caverns and Twelve Divisions as the mother of teachings, synthesizing the Five Bamboo Tablets and Seven Thousand *Ji* as the pivot of the Dao, they surge and swirl at the pearl-like mouth, circulate and revolve within the encircling center, then take what the mouth imparts as the unfolding of mysteries and what the ear hears as the verification of truth. Yet since this mountain came into being, the permeation of yin and yang, the division of dusk and dawn, the mutual propulsion of sun and moon, the mutual agitation of clouds and thunder—how swiftly do violent winds and torrential rains vanish into nothingness, how do carved mists and trailing clouds return to simplicity! When crows cry and the forest grows still, movement contains quiescence; when dragons coil and mists cling to the eaves, stillness holds resonance. Transforming and flowing through the four seasons, shaping into the ten thousand things, the ungoverning governor, the unspiritual spirit—all are the teachings of spontaneity, yet none awaken to them.

Chudao said: “If this be my record, then through kalpas to the present, the courtyards of a thousand sages lie in ruins.” Nevertheless, I shall further expound for you: The learning of the Old Master of the Zhou is rooted in purity, clarity, emptiness, and luminosity, its practice in compassion, frugality, loyalty, and filial piety. Its non-action is yet non-non-action, akin to the *Yi*; its non-contention means none contend with it, akin to the *Great Plan*. The discourse on the Valley Spirit approaches receptivity to the void; the metaphor of the infant approaches preservation; cultivation for longevity approaches praying to Heaven for eternal life. The *True Instructions* speak of nature uniting with the Dao, which by its essence aligns with the *Doctrine of the Mean*. Master Wang’s teaching that “a single qi’s aperture is spiritually present at midnight” approaches Mencius. As for the *Huainanzi*’s tracing of the Dao’s ultimate to harmony and nature—freeing fathers from grief over lost sons, elder brothers from mourning younger ones, children from orphanhood, women from widowhood, beasts from stillborn young, and birds from broken eggs—this, too, is the family tradition of our Confucian school.

Now that this hall is completed, with jade eyes gleaming, how could there be none who yearn for the Dao and desire to behold it? If one can savor the Dharma like honey, attune the mind like a zither’s string, and purify the spirit and consciousness like a mirror; if one does good without seeking fame, pursues learning without haste for rank—then even a gift of large jades and a team of four horses could not sway one’s resolve to advance in the Dao. The sagely and perfected reside within oneself; there is no need to inquire of one’s neighbor.

May Xiazi ponder this deeply, may Yunsun polish it to brilliance.

Written on the day after the full moon of the seventh month in the third year of the Chunyou era by Wu Yong, Academician of the Baozhang Pavilion, Court Gentleman for Summons, Supervisor of the Yulong Wanshou Abbey in Longxing Prefecture, Founding Baron of Zhongjiang County with a fief of six hundred households, and recipient of the Purple Gold Fish-Bag.

**Record of the East Sun Tower**

I once ascended Pingdu Mountain to visit the former haunts of Master Zhou of Lianxi. Amidst scattered steles, I found a small fragment bearing two of his quatrains, their brushstrokes vigorous and upright, still carrying the warmth of his stern vitality—written during his tenure in Heyang. One poem on the *Yin Immortal’s Alchemical Formula* reads:

*At first beholding the alchemical formula, I trusted its profundity,*
*For it grasps the mechanism of yin and yang’s creation.*
*From mother to child it arises, capable of establishment;*
*After spirit and essence unite, one knows subtleties anew.*

I also obtained from a mountain dweller a copy of the *Alchemical Formula*, which for twenty years has lingered in my thoughts without fading. My ancestral tomb lies in Yuhang, and my mountain retreat stands there. I have visited Dongxiao Abbey several times, where the Daoist Canon’s manuscripts are most authentic. When not occupied with official duties, I would borrow and peruse them. Before long, I realized the *Alchemical Formula*’s essence was encapsulated in a single phrase by Master Zhou.

Formerly, in the capital’s blue-tiled abbey, there was one Da Qin, a native of Yuhang, granted the honorific “Lingyi.” He built a small tower, neither extravagant nor austere, suitable for poetry and wine. Its eaves seemed to soar beyond the dust, and when I visited with guests, he asked for a name. Just then, the morning sun rose above the high ridge, so I inscribed “East Sun Tower” for him, borrowing a phrase from the *Yin Immortal’s Alchemical Formula*.

Now, over a decade has passed. The *Alchemical Formula* has faded from memory, yet the meaning in Master Zhou’s poem remains vivid before my eyes. Lingyi’s grandson, Shouyi, entrusted Rugui to convey: “Lingyi passed away at eighty-six, and wishes to understand the significance of the tower’s name, that its hidden radiance may be revealed.”

I replied: The *Qian*’s primordial yang spirit is what I rely upon to begin; the *Kun*’s primordial yin essence is what I rely upon to live. The primordial is one, yet divides into two forms, giving rise to superiority and inferiority, nobility and baseness. In terms of superiority, *Qian* precedes *Kun*, for the noble should come first. In terms of nobility, yin precedes yang, for the noble should reside behind. With precedence comes obstruction and separation, harmony and contention—equality cannot be achieved. Inequality leads to dispersion; dispersion gives way to change. Mutual preservation yields union, and union is great harmony. Things are born from harmony and die from change. When spirit and essence unite as one, it is like the sun and moon uniting as one. When sun and moon unite, the primordial *Qian* and *Kun* return to oneness—this is the correct Dao of Heaven and Earth, the universal principle of the ten thousand things. The sage uses this to create rites and music, extending it throughout the world. Rites ensure no departure goes unreturned; music ensures no advance goes unreversed. This Dao, though some perceive its greatness and others its smallness, has never been lost.

Yet when the Zhou declined and the Dao waned, the rites and music of the Four Dynasties were entrusted to the archivist beneath the pillars. Some adopted them to nurture their lives. Nevertheless, rites and music are instruments of great harmony, employed to establish Heaven and Earth and pervade the ten thousand things—not possessions to be privately claimed.

To claim it as private is to diminish it. Yet when one’s knowledge is vast and fully realized, it becomes great. Thus, a single thing may perish, but the ten thousand things are endless; a single body may end, but the multitudes of people are without end. Where then lies the division between self and others? When the spirit unites and attains its destined end, all within the Four Seas—those who share its undying essence—are but manifestations of that single spirit. Do they not endure as long as Heaven and Earth?

The misty expanse of Pingdu remains vast, yet few of its stone inscriptions survive. By inscribing this upon the caves of Dongxiao, may the legacy of the Confucian masters not fade—is this not fitting?

**Record of Divine Radiance at Qizhen Cave**
In the first mid-summer of the Shaoding era (1231), Yang Gong Yanzhan, a Gentleman of the Court, traveled to Jiusuo Mountain. He traversed its secluded cliffs and deep valleys without omission. On the twenty-first day, he reached Qizhen Cave, ascending its eastern and western terraces. At the cave’s summit stood a formation resembling a parasol; as torches were lit to illuminate it, a divine radiance suddenly erupted from the eastern terrace—round as a full moon, half azure and half white. It rose to the parasol’s height before halting, its brilliance eclipsing the flames. Only after a long while did it dissipate. The onlookers marveled, and the gentleman turned to his fellow Daoist companions: "What omen is this?"

Siming replied: "Ah! It has been over two hundred and twenty years. During the Xiangfu era, the state revered the Mysterious Teachings. Minister Chen Wenhui, then Transport Commissioner, led officials in prayer at Dadi Cave. At that time, this same radiance appeared within the cave, illuminating the forests and foothills. Wenhui memorialized the court, and an imperial edict bestowed praise, prompting the renaming of the cave as Dongxiao Palace. The inscribed pavilion, *Xiangguang* (‘Auspicious Radiance’), became a hallmark of that era. Today, the flourishing of the Mysterious Teachings is no different from the Xiangfu era. You, sir, as a descendant of meritorious officials, have served in the Court of Judicature and Revision—how could your renown, virtue, and prestige fall below Wenhui’s? The divine radiance of both caves manifested for a purpose, not by chance."

The gentleman sighed: "What am I compared to Wenhui? The arrival of this auspicious sign merely coincides with my presence. Yet I dare not betray the numen of this grotto-heaven." Thus, he donated funds to purchase fields, aiding the temple’s kitchens in gratitude for the divine favor.

Alas! From the ascent of Tianmu in the Yuanfeng era to the present, when have ages lacked such wondrous signs? I inscribe here what I have personally witnessed to move our contemporaries, that future generations may take heed—and never forget the virtue of Yang Gong.

The gentleman’s name was Bochan; Yanzhan was his courtesy name. A descendant of Prince Gong of He, he embraced goodness and disregarded rank, no different from a Confucian scholar. At that time, the Recluse of the Eastern Terrace, Xu Canxuan, composed verses in the mountains, likening the full-moon radiance to the manifestation of the Great Thousand.

*Recorded on the Summer Solstice of the fifth year of Shaoding (1232) by Wang Siming, Perfected Master Yuansu of the mountain.*

**Inscribed Dharma Verses for the Hall of Propagating the Teachings**
Dongxiao and Dadi caves guard the divine capital,
Jade pendants and golden tablets summon the hundred spirits.

The Heavenly Pillar’s single peak pierces the azure vault,
Nine-fold cloud gates lock the layered emerald screens.
Before and behind, the peaks lie veiled in mist,
East and west, the caves sigh with chill winds.

I hear Su Shi’s ink still lingers here—
Let us sit together in the Emerald Dragon Pavilion.
Guests enter the cave’s gate,
Where limpid purity bathes the mountain’s bones.
Cold verdure stretches endlessly,
The ancient grotto’s green remains unchanged.
By the waterfall’s spring,
Jade leaves brush the thousand-year grass in the wind;
Beside the cloud-rooted stone,
Golden stalks moisten the ten-thousand-year lingzhi with dew.

I shall summon Qiu Xuantong,
And together call upon Sima Chengzheng,
Grasp Guo Wenju’s hand to the left,
Clap Xu Yuanyou’s shoulder to the right.
We’ll ascend the Heavenly Altar,
Visit the Stone Chamber,
Enter the Herb Garden,
Pay homage at the Thatched Hall,
Climb the Cliff of Welcoming Worthies,
Seek the Bone-Free Bamboo.
Ten thousand pines seal away the red dust’s shadow,
Three paths congeal with cold, mottled moss.

This is the capital where imperial winds and thunder gather,
The ground where dragons and spirits assemble for review.
Thus, when the imperial carriage journeyed south,
Reverent incense fires were kindled in solemn devotion;
When the Purple Palace stood west of Mount E,
It awaited the leisure of the imperial terrace’s equanimity.

Of old, there were rites of golden dragons and jade tablets;
Today, the forms of blue petitions and vermilion memorials remain.
Successive sages all paid heed to this,
And in our time, homage is rendered even more.

On this day, the wind is mild and egrets rejoice,
The waters warm and flowers fragrant.
The National Preceptor is dispatched,
The Attendant of the Dawn serves the court.
The Perfected One receives the imperial decree face-to-face,
The Great Dizi admonishes the true;
The Registrar oversees the high officials,
The Attendant of the Dawn discerns righteousness.
The Palace Superintendent, Master Feng,
Rides the wind’s chariot, harmonizing with heaven’s fragrance,
To arrive at the immortal capital.

At this grand occasion, in the year *dingchou*,
The imperial brush inscribed the three great characters *Hall of Propagating the Teachings*,
Bestowed upon the mountain-dwelling *Chongmiao* Master Gong Daming.
Five springs have passed,
And now the inscribed plaque is hung—
Truly, it soars like phoenixes and dragons,
Leaps like jiao and tigers,
The Dipper’s steps gleam resplendent,
The Milky Way shines in radiant return.
Here are iron strokes and silver hooks,
Proclaimed in gold inlay and jade carving,
Their light illuminating the grasses and trees,
Their glory overflowing the mist and clouds.

As our teaching is destined to flourish,
And this sacred mountain shall never perish,
Now is the time when the jade candle aligns with heaven,
The golden truth propagates the Dao.
Recently, the mountain’s completion was celebrated,
And the Dharma Hall received this imperial ink.
Cloud-capped eaves and mist-wreathed beams
Span the cold sky;
Moonlit plinths and star-studded pillars
Form the wondrous Dharma abode.
How is this different from the realm of *Qianlin*?
Fitting indeed for the Jade Bureau’s repose.

Unfolding the subtleties of the Three Caverns and Four Auxiliaries,
Expounding the wonders of the Eight Extremes and Nine Heavens.
This plaque now hung,
Sun and moon share its brilliance;
These words no falsehood,
Heaven and humanity are illumined.

Let the assembly now say:
What verse shall we offer to celebrate the plaque’s unveiling?
*"The Nine Peaks’ clouds rest in the boundless sky,
The Five Caves’ winds clear beneath the nurturing sun."*

Composed in the third month of the tenth year of Jiading (*xinsi*, 1217) by the Daoist Bai Yuchan.

**Record of the Reconstruction of Dongxiao Palace**

The Dao is the ancestor of the Three Ultimates,
Vastly encompassing the cosmos without revealing its bounds,
Subtly entering the finest grain without revealing its core.
It generates yang and yin,
Spirits and gods, emperors and sages,
Molding the thousand sages,
Unlocking the myriad phenomena—
Yet its traces are unseen.

Nothing is greater than heaven and earth,
Yet the Dao props them up;
Nothing is more secluded than mountains and rivers,
Yet the Dao fills them.
The Dao is principle,
Principle is the Supreme Ultimate,
The Supreme Ultimate is fundamentally the Limitless.
It props up all above,
Without a moment’s pause—
Thus, the Heavenly Pillar fills its midst.
It pervades all within,
Without a single gap—
Thus, the Cavern Heaven.

Alas! Those who speak of the Heavenly Pillar and Cavern Heaven—
Do they know the Dao?
Do they show the essence of the utmost Dao,
The gate of all wonders?

Heaven has form, the Dao has no body—
Who gathers the tangible with the intangible?
Heaven is vast, the cavern is small—
Who contains the great within the small?

The Heavenly Pillar is the *Great Change*,
Embodying the image of heaven standing above;
Laozi’s teaching that heaven and earth attain unity in clarity and tranquility.
The Cavern Heaven is the *Great Change*’s image of heaven within mountains,
Laozi’s intent that the valley attains unity and becomes full—
There is no doubt of this.

In ancient records, Nüwa severed the turtle’s legs to prop up the four poles.
Not the turtle—it was the Dao,
A metaphor for the Heavenly Pillar.
The Primordial Beginning sat upon the *Fuli* jewel,
And the gods of the ten directions all entered within.
Not the gods—it was the Dao,
A metaphor for the Cavern Heaven.

The Great Dripping Mountain’s Cavern Radiance Palace in Yuhang stands as one of the Thirty-Six Cavern Heavens, forming a triad with the Heavenly Pillar of Shuzhou and Shouyang. Its halls of gold and chambers of jade ascend to the Great Tenuity; its marvels and divine splendors defy enumeration. Emperor Wu of Han enfeoffed the spirit of the Winding Marquis here. From the Jin through the Tang and into the Song, successive dynasties revered and offered solemn rites, and generations of eminent figures upheld this Dao.

In the twelfth month of the Jiaxu year of the Xianchun era, fire broke out through negligence, reducing a thousand pillars to ash. As the world’s fortunes turned and the mountain submitted to the Sagely Dynasty, the elders of the mountain pooled their strength to rebuild. Their efforts bore fruit, yet in the sixth month of the Jiachen year of the Zhiyuan era, a conflagration arose once more, consuming all in a single night. The fourfold assembly stood in sorrowful dismay.

The Palace Supervisor, Master Lang Rushan of Yishan, and the Palace Director, Master Shu Yuanyi of Guilin—men of keen resolve and unyielding integrity—neither faltered nor feared. They declared to the assembly: “We shall renew it! We shall procure timber from other mountains and transport grain from elsewhere.” With unified purpose and collective thought, they gathered laborers and measured materials. First, they built the kitchens and storehouses, then erected the great hall along with the remaining structures. On the renzi day of the third month in the Yiwei year of the Yuanzhen era, the work was completed.

The halls gleamed with resplendent gold and azure, their radiance illuminating the valleys and forests—such craftsmanship seemed the work of spirits and ghosts, scarcely an exaggeration. The imperial court revered and protected it more than ever before. Upon completion, I was entreated to compose this record. I declined, yet pressed to comply, I declared: “The grotto has its heaven, and heaven has its pillars—I have spoken of this before. Within heaven lies yet another heaven. To speak fully: the heaven within heaven ascends to the utmost heights, forming the Three Realms. Though the realms are named the Three Clarities, they are one; and though threefold thrice to make nine, though called the Nine Clarities, they are still one. Those who cultivate the Dao refine yang to dissolve yin, dwelling in constant mindfulness, aligning their own clarity with the clarity of creation. Clarity, oh clarity! Does it not transcend all forms without decay?”

Thus, I set it to writing.

In the first year of the Yuanzhen era, cyclical year *yiwei*, ninth month, day *yihai*, recorded by Jia Xuanweng, former Grand Academician of the Enduring Enlightenment Hall, Grand Master for Thorough Service, Signatory of the Bureau of Military Affairs, and Participant in the Deliberations of Government.

**Record of the Hall of August Heaven**

The movement of the Supreme Ultimate generates yang, while its stillness generates yin. Yang, light and pure, ascends to form heaven, where sun, moon, stars, thunder, lightning, wind, and rain reside. Yin, heavy and turbid, descends to form earth, where hills, mountains, valleys, marshes, rivers, and seas abide. Yang transforms into yin, transmuting its qi; when harmonious and balanced, it becomes humanity. In the spaces between, there is nothing without a governing spirit.

With reverence, we consider the August Jade Emperor of Heaven, who occupies the most exalted position of the Three Extremes and governs the myriad beings. All that heaven and earth cover and sustain, all that the sun and moon illuminate, all the movements of the stars, all the surging, stirring, and nourishing of thunder, lightning, wind, and rain, all the towering majesty of hills and mountains, all the flowing and soaking of streams and marshes, all the mutual sustenance of humankind through the ages without cease—who does not owe this to the power of the Emperor?

The *Daoist Canon* records that within heaven and earth, beyond the Ten Great Grotto-Heavens, there are thirty-six further grotto-heavens, governed by immortal officials as the lower courts of the Heavenly Emperor. The Great Dipper’s Mystic Canopy Grotto-Heaven is the twenty-fourth among them. Since its establishment as a palace and altar in the Yuanfeng era of the Han, through the Jin and Tang dynasties, extraordinary figures have emerged in succession, and it was later renamed the Temple of the Heavenly Pillar. During the Xiangfu era of the Song, it was again renamed the Grotto-Celestial Palace. As the old records attest, its geographical eminence rivals the Chongfu Temple of Mount Song, together standing as the foremost of all Daoist temples in the world—this is indeed true.

Over more than two thousand years, its fortunes have risen and fallen. Yet from the year *jiaxu* to the year *jiashen*, spanning eleven years, it twice suffered celestial calamities, its deep halls and storied pavilions reduced to flying dust, and the task of rebuilding with timber and earth proved arduous. Thus, beyond the eastern and western wings of the great hall and the two halls of the refectory and storehouse, resources were insufficient. The triple gate and the various shrines were all undertaken and completed by the elders of the mountain, each assuming their part.

The Hall of August Heaven was built by the present abbot, the Daoist Master of Pure Cultivation and Mystic Void, Shu Yuanyi, and the Daoist Master of Pure Cultivation and Wondrous Void, Shen Duofu. This hall stands where four mountains converge, rising majestically. To the east of the great hall, it soars over seventy *chi* in height, spanning five bays. Its wings spread like soaring green jade, a magnificent spectacle of unparalleled grandeur.

Though it may seem but a wondrous manifestation of the subtle and true, drifting beyond the vast winds of the celestial pole, the transformations of the divine are boundless—where do they not reach? One may envision the grand music of the celestial spheres, the feasting and wandering in the Jade Capital, gazing down upon the lower courts, where such a lofty abode now stands. Such magnificence must surely be favored by the august spirits.

The human body, with its spirit dwelling in the *niwan* (mud-pill palace), is like heaven. The central emptiness of the Yellow Court is like the lower court of the grotto-heaven beneath the Heavenly Emperor. If one makes this central void the dwelling place of one’s spirit, the body attains great peace, and in time, one becomes an immortal. If the lofty above can cast its radiance downward, how could it not grant eternal life and secure the great peace of the nation and the earth? This hall, though distant, bears a weight of profound significance.

Deputy Palace Affairs Officer Gao Hui-chen and Chief Supervisor of Palace Affairs Jin Changqing, both of great strength in governance, are rightfully recorded for their great virtue. In the sixth year of the Dade reign, the fifteenth day of the twelfth lunar month (ren-yin), noted by Deng Mu of Qiantang.

*Record of the White Deer Mountain Chamber*

The Great Scouring Grotto-Heaven emerges from Tianmu, its undulating ridges embracing the northern banks of Yaoxi. Its terrain dominates the lands to the right of Zhe, and since antiquity, Daoists have come to wander or dwell here, while immortals ascending to the heavens are too numerous to count.

Yet among the mountain’s finest springs and rocks, most face north; only White Deer Mountain turns southward in splendor. This peak stands as the central summit of the Great Scouring, with the Ascension Altar atop it and a stone chamber below.

According to old records, during the Jin dynasty, the Perfected Lord Xu Yuanyou built an altar here to refine elixirs. When the elixir was complete, white deer from all under heaven came to welcome him away, thus giving the mountain its name. Later, the Celestial Master Wu Zhenjie of Taiping—renowned for his literary grace, his name ranked alongside Li Bai—was displeased with the stone chamber being used as a library. He concealed his bodily ascension (shijie) in Xuancheng, instructing his disciples: "Return to the Stone Chamber of Tianzhu." This is how the chamber gained its fame.

During the Song dynasty, scholars such as Yong Zhong, Wang Yuansu, and Zhu Fuchang successively practiced the Dao here, further enhancing its renown. Since Yong Zhong constructed his dwelling, affiliated with the Dongxiao Palace, nearly two hundred years have passed, with periods of flourishing and decline.

In the early years of the Dade reign, Master Shen Jieshi came to reside on the mountain. Upon ascending the viewing tower, he was moved by the past worthies who never returned, lamenting the fading traces of their legacy. He planned to build a lofty abode to await kindred spirits, but the scale of construction overwhelmed his resources. Thereupon, Xu Hefu offered his counsel: "A dwelling need not be grand or humble—only sufficient to shelter from wind and rain. Guo Wenju was such a man; would he have disdained austerity? Otherwise, one merely consumes grain. What benefit is there in vast halls?"

Thus were constructed several stone chambers atop the peak. Though their gates, kitchens, and living quarters were but modest in scale, they stood before the towering Tianzhu Peak, with the Shengtian Altar and the Dragon and Phoenix Caves at their back. To the left lay the path leading to the Xizhen Cave, while to the right, the view stretched far. On all sides, the land rose like a screen or curtain, encircling the site, while below, five towering pines stood wing-like, their branches arrayed as if to welcome the fragrant summer breeze. Here, one might escape the scorching sun or find shelter from the chill of snow-laden mornings and moonlit nights—nowhere else could rival this secluded realm. It was hoped that reclusive worthies from beyond the mundane world might deign to rest here.

At that time, Deng Muxin, a native of Hangzhou then residing on the mountain, joined Meng Gongjixu and his disciple Sun Shiyuanfu in contributing to the project. A chamber was added to the rear, nestled between two rocks, square as a towering ship. Intended to fulfill the aspirations of those who sought seclusion, Deng further commissioned laborers to excavate the earth, unearthing five or six remarkable stones. To the east, one resembled a hollowed-out cinnabar vessel at its base; another, with its linked tiers, evoked an intricately carved water clock; a third bore a circular aperture piercing its crown, its summit sharp as a rhinoceros horn; still others intertwined like ant mounds or wasp nests, their forms interlocking and perforated. To the west, the stones gleamed with azure translucence, their three faces rising in stately array, as if frozen in solemn stillness. Though the site spanned no more than a few *zhang*, it encompassed the essence of a thousand peaks and ten thousand ravines, their myriad forms and moods fully captured. A treasure concealed since antiquity now lay before the eye—one could but sigh in wonder: *"Such is the nature of stone! The essence and beauty of mountains and rivers, fused and concealed beneath soil and earth for who knows how many years, only to be revealed by one with discernment and unearthed by one with strength, at last becoming a marvel for mortals to behold—a spectacle coeval with heaven and earth. Yet how many among us lack such innate brilliance and refinement? Instead, we are encumbered by the soil of passions and desires, obscured by the dust of worldly affairs. Those who might reveal our potential lack discernment; those who might uplift us lack strength. Thus do we remain hidden like unpolished pearls, gazing upward in vain. The worthies of the Jin, Tang, and Song—whether dragons or fish, tigers or mice, roc or sparrow—never deigned to guide us, not even as much as these stones have found their kindred spirit."*

Before he had finished speaking, I happened to ascend the mountain by moonlight. He recounted the entire affair to me and asked for a name for the chamber. I thus followed its origins in naming it the **White Deer Mountain Lodge**, and have here recorded its story.

*Written on the fifteenth day of the fourth month in the ninth year of the Dade reign (1305), by Ye Lin of Qiantang, a humble servant of Dishan.*

### Record of Yuanqing Palace

Yuanqing Palace was established by Master Shu, the *Tidian* (Supervisor) and Abbot of Dongxiao Palace. Why was it named *Shansu* (Mountain Simplicity)? Among the eighteen vegetarian halls of Dongxiao, *Shansu* was one, and Yuanqing was affiliated with it—a place where those beyond the mundane world might find repose. Why, then, was it built not in Qiantang but in Jinnan Township of Lin’an? It was the birthplace of the master. And why was it called *Yuanqing*?

Master Yuanqing’s personal name was Yuan Yi, and his disciple, Layman Jin, was named Changqing. The palace was thus named by combining their names.

As recorded in the *Jin History*, Lin’an abounded in halls of gold and jade, and immortal herbs and fungi. Even in the late Han dynasty, some attained the Dao here. The palace occupies a site of surpassing beauty: to the east, it embraces the mountains of Qin and Crane; to the west, it cradles Stone Mirror Peak. Above, it connects to Nine Immortals and Tianmu; below, it links to Nine Locks and Heavenly Pillar. The northern and southern streams, both issuing from Tianmu, converge at Solitary Mountain like a sash of brocade. The landscape’s grandeur is unmatched. Though I have never set foot there, I have often heard the master describe it, and it has long entered my dreams.

Upon the palace’s completion, the master came to my door and said: “I am a man of rugged and solitary ways. From childhood, I had neither kin nor support, and so I left the world to enter the Dao at Dongxiao Palace. Master Xu Yingshi was my grandfather in the Dao. At our first meeting, he saw in me one who might inherit his teaching. My means were meager then, yet he believed I could revive the incense and verdure of the altar. I feared I could not live up to his expectations, so I devoted myself to what I ought to learn. Though my progress was modest, I never shirked the duties of my office, however humble.

In the year *dingwei* (1267), I was invested with robes and cap. From then on, in all matters of the Dao—whether drafting memorials, reciting scriptures, or transcribing texts—I spared no effort. First, I renovated the living quarters, replacing the old with the new. In the year *jiaxu* (1274), Dongxiao Palace burned. By the ninth year of the *Zhiyuan* reign (1272) under the imperial Yuan, it was *jiashen* (1284), and the palace burned again. Such is the way of things: tiles and rubble may transform into gold and jade, and gold and jade may crumble back into rubble. Yet from the ashes of calamity, I restored both public halls and private chambers to their former glory. In the early days of my service, though I received only simple offerings of food and drink, I took no thought for myself, and those who had fled in all directions found refuge and peace. Though I dare not call it merit, my labors were not slight. In this, I have perhaps not betrayed the trust my grandfather placed in me.

At Dongxiao, I began as keeper of memorials and manager of the treasury, rising to deputy abbot, advancing step by step without thought of skipping ranks or seeking distinction. In the teaching, my offices progressed from Daoist Registrar of Hangzhou Prefecture to Daoist Supervisor of Western Zhejiang, and then to Abbot of Kaiyuan Palace, overseeing all Daoist affairs in the region. Appointments were made on the recommendation of senior lecturers, and I knew nothing of self-promotion or currying favor.

Yet I could not forget the fishing and wandering traces of my native Jinnan, still vivid before me, nor the unrequited toil of my parents. I asked myself: *Can even the Most High remain unmoved by such bonds?* So I took the savings from my robe and alms bowl and built this sanctuary on the old site, to repay my origins. The Hall of Radiant Yang enshrines the Three Clarities; the Tower of the Jade Armillary serves as the altar for the Seven Governors. The community gathers to pray for the emperor’s longevity, offering reverent worship morning and night.

Previously, there were shrines to the Daoist Registrar and the Cloud Assembly, each with its own hall. The three gates, two wings, and all auxiliary structures—kitchens, storerooms, and blessings—were complete. Construction began in the year *jiawu* (1314) and was completed in the year *jihai* of the *Dade* reign (1319). The beams and rafters are adorned with elegance; the images are arrayed in solemn majesty. There are mountains for firewood, gardens for vegetables, and fields near the city walls to provide congee. The expenses for incense and lamps are met by the income from the land.

When the Celestial Master and Perfected One visited the ancestral court, he followed the official route and marveled at the splendid halls. Joy suffused his brow as he inscribed the present plaque to consecrate this mountain. He appointed me as the founding abbot, while Changqing was named Supervisor and Director of Palace Affairs. May this lineage endure through the cycles of *jia* and *yi*, forever without decline.

Initially, Changqing and my disciple Sun Jin Zhengshao contributed greatly to recommending worthy men and offering their strength. Changqing styled himself Jade Mirror; Zhengshao, Mountain Restraint. Zhengshao has long since departed this world, and I intend to pass the tripod of transmission to Changqing’s successor, Dong Guining, establishing the Yuanqing lineage. Though it will be secondary to the Dongxiao lineage, the palace’s finances and accounts must still be overseen by Dongxiao’s authority.

Systems must be established for affairs to endure without decay. Yet without inscription in metal and stone, they may fade with time. Thus, I seek a text from your hand to ensure this does not perish.

Alas! Such is the master’s account. Without deep experience, far-reaching vision, and meticulous foresight, could one have achieved this?”

The Yuan is the inception of qi, whereby Heaven attains purity, enabling it to endure from high antiquity without aging and to govern the myriad existences without dominion. Inquiring into the grotto-heavens, there exists the Bureau of Supreme Mystery, which oversees the Perfected, and the Hall of Ascendant Perfected Transformations. Later generations named its halls differently—some as the Hall of Mystery and Perfection, others as the Hall of Ascendant Yuan—yet is there not a unifying principle in their combined nomenclature?

Moreover, Lu Lian’s record of the auspicious encounter with Guan Yin, and the incense burner that gathered the beauty of Hongjing, here evoke filial piety. The site’s excellence arises from its unchosen virtue, as if bestowed by Heaven and imparted by the divine. Thus, I gladly inscribe this record.

As for the craftsmanship, the tally of labor and expenses in silk—such matters are commonplace and need not be recorded.

In the second month of the dingyou year, the Master reverently received the imperial decree of Great Protection. By the seventh month of the following autumn, he was honored with the imperial appointment as *Tidian* Abbot. In the twelfth month, the Prince of Zhenyuan memorialized the throne, bestowing upon him the cap and ritual robes of the Illuminating and Unadorned Perfected, a mark of timely honor. The Master, a paragon of the Daoist tradition, was acclaimed by his robed peers as Master Cassia Grove.

On the day *jiwei* in the second month of the fourth year of the Dade era, Zhang Bochun, Hanlin Academician, *Fengyi Dafu*, Drafter of Edicts, and Compiler of the National History, recorded this.

*Record of the Reconstruction of the Chongtian Abbey*

The nature of benevolence and wisdom cannot be unified, and to harmonize their joy is difficult; the power of circumstances and aspirations cannot be combined, and to achieve through enduring effort is no easy task. Mountains and forests, hills and fields—whether they stand or fall, whether their joy is spiritual—may not please all, so why trouble oneself over such matters? To exhaust years and months in service to things is to be enslaved by them, and enslavement to things is not the Way. Yet if one does not serve things, how can that be the Way?

The common people know not of it in their daily lives, and even Confucians do not depart from it for a moment—how much more so that names must be speakable, and words must be actionable. Behold the mountains, where a thousand peaks vie in beauty, revealing the principle of the Profound Mystery; gaze upon the waters, where ten thousand ripples return to one, approaching the virtue of Supreme Goodness. If one borrows from things to act, then where is there not the Way?

Chongtian Abbey was originally established in a villa of Wuxing, where the winds of the watery realm ran high, white reeds aged in autumn, and egrets and gulls gathered in companionship amid the vast expanse. This was the aspiration of the former patriarchs—Master Sun of Pengshan, Master Gong of Juyan, and Master Zhou of Qingxi. Yet before their wishes could be fulfilled, the stones of the kalpa shifted, and the city’s fortunes changed, much like the crane of the memorial pillar; the clear shallows of the dusty waves were no different from a boat adrift in Penglai. Abandoning the old to pursue the new, moving from the distant to the near, the gates of Mount Dadi seemed as if opened by heaven, and travelers on the duckweed-strewn paths gathered like clouds. Though this differed from the meticulous measurements of the mundane world, the land was not narrow—yet level ground as smooth as a whetstone was rare; the timber was not insufficient—yet how could it be transported as if by spirits or ghosts? The high was leveled, the low was expanded, the overgrown was cleared, and the fine was filled—was this effort not arduous and difficult?

For those who later enter these gates and wander by moonlight, ascend this hall and sit in song, bow to the white clouds and summon the pale moon—how easily is this spoken! The labor spanned so many years and days, the expenses so many bolts of silk and measures of grain; let this record suffice for its completion. As for the necessity of daily repairs, this is the hope placed in future descendants—such is the aspiration, not the power of circumstances.

Thus, I append these words:

O Mount Dadi, towering and lofty!
O waters of Dadi, trickling and surging!
The forests of Dadi, from saplings to towering canopies—though washed clean, they are not as before, yet they still rise above the weeds.
Now, standing five *zhang* high to complete nine *ren*, the toil began with a single basket.

Alas! Leaning on the parasol tree to rest, staff in hand to roam—why not observe this body, which is named by the Way? It should be like the construction of a hall, not like the thatch blocking the path.
The mountain is my benevolence, the water my wisdom—nothing small is lacking, nothing great is unencompassed.
A hand’s breadth ascends on the whirlwind, a single ladle of oil nourishes the fields.
Thus, all that is accumulated over years to reach completion—how could even a hair’s breadth be lacking?

What the world calls ethics, the Way calls merit, conduct, and the power of aspiration. If a province is deficient, who can escape blame before heaven and earth?
The Duke of Zanhuang said: "Those who destroy even a single tree or stone of Pingquan are not my descendants." May the power of vigilant protection repel malevolent spirits from the mountain’s left, and may the efficacy of inscribed proclamations guide the vulgar chariots to the aid of the cliffs.

Before metal and stone exhort, words must be acted upon, and actions must endure—truly, one cannot but place hope in those who take up the task.

On the full moon of the second month in the *jichou* year of the Zhiyuan era (1289), Shen Duofu, Abbot of the Mountain, recorded this.

*Record of Chongtian Abbey*

The finest landscapes of the Two Zhe provinces lie in the southeast; among them, Hangzhou in western Zhejiang is preeminent, and within Hangzhou, Yuhang is the finest. Eighteen *li* upstream from the great river of the inverted Tianmu Mountains stands Dongxiao Palace, which is the Great Refining Grotto-Heaven of Dadi—another of Yuhang’s most scenic sites. Several *li* before reaching the palace, the two mountains flank the path, winding through nine locks. The auspicious *qi* coils and thickens, which is why Daoists like the two Perfected Lords Guo and Xu of the Jin, Wu Zhenjie of the Tang, and their contemporaries Zixu and Jianqiu Xuantong, all sojourned here in lofty retreat, leaving traces that remain to this day. Even now, those who explore the hidden and visit the ancient feel a sudden longing for transcendence.

Beyond the nine locks stands a mountain named Renshou, its *qi* and form uniquely majestic, revered as the ancestor of the surrounding peaks. Yet it was overgrown with brambles and hidden from view, unnoticed by passersby. In the *renwu* year of the Zhiyuan era (1282), the former superintendent of Dongxiao Palace, Master Zhou of Qingxi, said: "This land is beloved by our patriarch. With his disciple, Master Zhang Hantong, he ordered laborers to cut into the mountain’s base on three sides for over two hundred *zhang*, clearing it into level ground and constructing halls." Earlier, during the Xianchun era of the Song, the patriarch Sun Lingji of Lingji Abbey and the preceptor Gong Yanshi had petitioned for the name *Chongtian Abbey*, granted under the jurisdiction of Qiantang, and built the abbey by the stream—though it was soon destroyed by calamity. It was then relocated and renamed.

Over the next four or five years, the work remained unfinished as successive masters passed away.

Now the abbot of Dongxiao, Master Shen Jieshi, as a dharma-grandson, exerted every effort to complete the construction. Be it halls, chambers, or gates—all were arranged in proper order. Verdant hues filled the pavilions, and limpid streams flowed into the kitchens. The four encircling mountains and the lush growth of a hundred trees enveloped the site: travelers on the heights heard the sounds of bells and chimes yet saw no trace of the abbey, while those dwelling within heard the rumble of carriages and horses yet knew not whence the road came.

The rear mountain grew ever steeper, so winding paths were laid along the slopes. Shaded by blossoms and bamboo, they awaited visitors; where the land leveled slightly, rows of seated stones offered rest. At the highest point stood the circular altar, from which one could gaze into the distance. There, one might pluck the zither, chant poetry, and while away the day. From time to time, recluses from beyond the world were invited to reside here.

In his leisure, Master Shen would travel by light carriage to and fro, engaging in discourse on profound principles. He once addressed the assembly, saying: "This land’s excellence lies in this: when one dwells here, brambles cannot overgrow our courtyards, nor can wolves and tigers breach our walls—is this not a secure dwelling for all under heaven? The peace of the body lies in this: when the heart dwells within, desires cannot overgrow its inner terrain, nor can profit and harm assail it from without—is this not the hidden immortality of the mountain’s depths? Truly, he who skillfully dwells in his heart does so as one who dwells in his body.

The Great Purification, that ancient grotto-heaven, is the source from which this mountain’s purification arises. Of those who dwell here, need they all be men of the Jin and Tang? Surely among them are those who cast off worldly dust, soaring in spirit through the azure void, thereby fulfilling the long-held aspirations of our patriarchs and the deepest hopes of my own heart—only then will it truly accord with the meaning of *Chongtian*."

The assembly replied in assent. At that time, when I passed by, I heard this from Master Shen’s dharma-grandson, Meng Jixu, and thus recorded it.

In the fifth year of the *Dade* reign, on the *shangyuan* day of the *gengzi* year, recorded by Deng Mu of Tietang, Recluse of the Stone Chamber.

**Record of the Qingzhen Daoist Abbey**

Eighteen *li* west of Qiantang lies Jiusuo Mountain. Following the Ni Stream upstream, the mountain’s foothills interlock on either side, winding paths threading between them. A hundred paces ahead, the way appears severed—this is the first *lock*. After nine such *locks*, the mountain’s ascent grows steeper, culminating in the Dongxiao Palace. Turning left, one reaches the *Shu Tianzhu* ("Bound Heavenly Pillar"), where the finest springs and rocks lie to the northwest, known as Qingtanshan ("Green Sandalwood Mountain"). Ancient records note that the Moon Grotto, Ice Flask, Mirror Pool, Sword-Testing Crag, and Verdant Emerald Cliff all reside within this mountain.

During the *Xianchun* era of the Song, Master Zhu of Ning Shen, former superintendent of Dongxiao Palace, built a shrine on the mountain’s southern face, as his ancestral tombs lay there. After Master Zhu’s passing in the *jichou* year of the *Zhiyuan* reign, his disciple, the *chongyi* Master Sun, and his grandson, the present *jingyi* Master Shu, expanded the site, naming it Qingzhen Daoist Abbey. The complex comprises some fifty or sixty halls, with gates, main halls, refectories, kitchens, and auxiliary structures all arranged according to proper measure. Pines and cedars cast their shade, flowers and herbs bloom in succession, and by day, silence reigns—hardly the realm of mortals.

Within the great gate, where the flowing spring runs straight, stone foundations emerge from the earth. Surrounding them like the base of a wall, a square pond is dug, housing hundreds of golden carp. When one taps the railings, they all gather to feed. The Flying Jade Spring cascades down the mountainside in a waterfall several *ren* high—this is its source.

In the *gengzi* year, I passed by Master Shu and stayed here to escape the summer heat, sharing wine and poetry while concocting elixirs. On leisurely days, we ascended the heights, and he pointed out the mountains to me, sighing: "To the southwest of the abbey lies Crouching Tiger Crag, where the Jin recluse Guo Wenju once dwelled. Westward rises Heavenly Altar Peak, where Xu Yuanzhou and Zhongju ascended. Below it lies a stone chamber where, in the Tang, Wu Zhenjie departed as an immortal, leaving behind his books and sword. To the north is the Great Purification Grotto, where Ji Zixu attained the Dao and departed for distant realms, and where my distant ancestor, Master Xuantong, built his retreat before entering this grotto to reach Huayang. The immortals—though their cultivation begins with inner refinement—are also stirred by the numinous essence of mountains and rivers. Looking back and forth across a thousand years, the vital breath remains unchanged. If one truly aspires to greatness, how could they fall short of the people of the Jin and Tang? Yet why do so many linger in fleeting pleasures, drunk in life, dreaming in death? A hundred years of glory vanish with transformation, and through a thousand kalpas of wandering, their sorrows know no end. Why not wield the numinous banner, nurture the fiery mushroom, turn the wind and return the light within the inch-field and foot-dwelling of the body, and ride the qi to soar the spirit above the Purple Tenuity of the Clear Capital, sharing a smile with those noble ones? If so, then inwardly, I would not betray my ancestors, and outwardly, I would not shame the Great Purification Grotto Heaven—would this not be fitting?"

I replied, "Indeed."

In the seventh month of the *gengzi* year of the *Dade* era, recorded by Deng Mu of Qiantang.

**Record of Jixu Academy**

The Hang Monk, Master Meng, styled Jixu, built a retreat by the Cao Stream as a place for reading, naming it after his style. I have heard the Old Master say: "Thirty spokes share one hub; it is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the wheel lies." To know emptiness is where the ten thousand things gather. Hollows gather wind, valleys gather water, ravines gather clouds, and the emptiness of a room gathers people. The emptiness of heaven and earth gathers the sun, moon, stars, mountains, rivers, grasses, trees, feathers, scales, and shells. Who would say that the emptiness of my single heart does not gather the Dao?

Yet the heart, as a thing, may be empty or obstructed; the Dao, as a thing, is only evanescent and indistinct. What was once called gathering can be seen, but this cannot be known—thus emptiness is often obstructed by strange things. That which is evanescent and indistinct may no longer gather. When the heart is without barriers, the poisons of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure assail it from within, while right and wrong, gain and loss crown it from without. Even a moment’s emptiness becomes unattainable. To seek the Dao thus is like striking a drum in search of a lost child.

Our Master Meng is not like this. Though a scholar by training, he dwells at the edge of the Daoist path, composing poetry and prose with proper discipline. He refined the mysterious and nurtured simplicity in the Nine-Locked Mountains, dwelling in fasting for three years. Later, he was entangled by worldly affairs and could not fulfill his aspirations, grieving over it. He amassed several thousand volumes of books, which he intended to store in his completed retreat. Here, he associated with extraordinary figures from beyond the mundane, discussing and practicing with them—his attainments are yet immeasurable.

Yet I say: if Master Meng has no aspiration for the Dao, so be it. But if he does, even books are a burden. I have seen scholars of this age who traverse the four directions for ten thousand *li* without anything escaping their knowledge, who span thousands of years without anything unheard. Yet when they return and seek their original heart, how few find it empty! The Way of the sages has become a lost learning—how lamentable!

I hope the Master will cast aside all his accumulated knowledge into the realm of nothingness, then, within the square inch of his heart, open it at dawn and purify it at dusk, so that even the slightest obstruction cannot linger within. Thus, he will progress further. Yanzi began with a love of learning and ended in sitting oblivion. The Dao gathers in emptiness—this is the wondrous attainment of profound self-realization. What manner of man was Yan?

In the first month of the *jihai* year of the *Dade* era, recorded by Deng Mu of Qiantang.
