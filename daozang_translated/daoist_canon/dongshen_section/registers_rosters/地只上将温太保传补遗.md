Marshal Wen was loyal and upright. After becoming a mountain spirit, he eternally safeguarded the incense and offerings of the Mysterious Emperor. The Emperor of the Eastern Peak commended him.

One day, the Northern Emperor bestowed a thousand pellets of plague medicine upon the Eastern Peak, strictly commanding that envoys be dispatched to spread pestilence, inspecting the world to punish those who were disloyal, unfilial, killed living beings, or harmed creatures. The Emperor of the Eastern Peak received the decree and summoned Wen to spread the plague.

Wen accepted the command and the medicine, pondering repeatedly. A single pellet could kill a thousand people, and the deaths of a thousand would bring calamity to a thousand households. Moreover, as the qi of the season circulated, the poison would spread disease, and the residual misfortune would afflict countless others. This would greatly violate the Supreme’s virtue of cherishing life. "Better that I sacrifice myself to save these countless lives—what regret could there be?" he thought. Facing the heavens and turning north, he swallowed all the pellets in one gulp.

Soon, his abdomen ached and his body burned with fever, unbearable to endure. He burned incense and went directly before the Emperor of the Eastern Peak, transforming into a great ferocious ghost. He reported the matter and prostrated himself, awaiting punishment. Just then, the Northern Emperor urgently pressed for the inspection to proceed. The Emperor of the Eastern Peak had no choice but to truthfully report Wen Qiong’s dereliction of duty. The Northern Emperor then sent him to the Right Victory Court to be reprimanded.

The Mysterious Emperor, admiring Wen’s intentions, interceded on his behalf, pleading for his pardon. The Northern Emperor approved the request and instructed Wen to serve exclusively under the Mysterious Emperor’s command, tasked with spreading transformation and slaying demons. From then on, his fame grew even more resounding.

Later, Cao Kefu of the Jade Numinous Palace was seen. From youth, he had revered the secret methods of the Earth Deities. Once, while performing transformations in Chiyang, there was a Five Manifestations Temple in the prefecture, renowned for its numinous efficacy, with magnificent halls and pavilions. An accompanying official was assigned to take charge of it. Initially, he brought his family to pay respects at the temple. His concubine entered the hall with him to admire it, but upon returning, she fell into a stupor, and no medicine could revive her. Her limbs stiffened, and she was placed in a coffin, not yet encoffined.

The clerks said, "There is a Daoist named Cao in the market who performs talismanic arts with great efficacy." The official sent for him. Upon arrival, Cao examined the situation and said, "It is too late by a day to revive her. I fear an investigation is needed—this is likely the work of malevolent spirits." The official agreed. Cao inscribed a talisman and performed a ritual, burning it beside the coffin. In an instant, the coffin lid lifted on its own, and the corpse leapt out, standing before Cao and making a choking sound.

Cao said, "This is the malevolent spirit that has been seized and attached to the corpse. Do not be alarmed. Let me interrogate it." After repeated punishments and questioning, the spirit finally confessed, "I am the fourth deity of this prefecture’s Five Kings Temple, the Bodhisattva Huaguang Zang." Cao asked why it had seized the soul of a living person. The spirit replied, "When the deceased entered the temple, she thought to herself, ‘How could there be such a fine man in the world?’ Seeing her improper thoughts arise, I seized her soul."

Cao ordered the spirit to release her. The spirit said, "Though the ritual master’s command cannot be disobeyed, the breath has already ceased, and nothing can be done." Enraged, Cao declared he would report to the Celestial Emperor to destroy its form. The spirit said, "I am formed from the vital qi of the Five Peaks and Four Streams, the essence of mountains and rivers. I am not like other spirits. The ritual master can only cut off the incense offerings in Chizhou." With that, the corpse returned to the coffin as before.

Cao ordered the coffin sealed and chose an auspicious day to report to the Celestial Emperor, dispatching Wen to slay the spirit. He then informed the accompanying official, who had all the clay statues transported to the training grounds and destroyed. Only when the fourth statue was struck did blood flow. From then on, the incense offerings in Chizhou ceased. Cao’s reputation soared as a result.

Later, he led the ranks of the jade palaces, never acting recklessly. When he did act, it was always efficacious. This was none other than Marshal Wen.

In another county near the Shu border, there was a spirit shrine of great numinous renown, repeatedly honored by the state, capable of bringing fortune or misfortune. Its inner sanctum was deeply secluded, and no one was permitted to enter rashly—those who did were invariably afflicted by the spirit. When the magistrate first arrived, he was already suspicious. Later, when his family fell ill, all blamed the spirit.

One day, under the pretext of other business, he ordered the patrol officer to lead archers to the shrine. Dressed in full ceremonial attire, he performed sacrifices and composed a proclamation to admonish the spirit. He then had the inner doors opened and led his men to force their way in. They saw an enormous monkey, which, caught off guard, could not transform. The magistrate ordered the archers to shoot it dead and burned the shrine.

The magistrate served his full three-year term and left with his family. On the journey home, they rested at an inn. While the magistrate was using the latrine, he suddenly saw a procession on the road welcoming a deity, with a grand retinue of riders and attendants. When he saw the deity being welcomed, it bore the same appearance as the monkey he had shot in the shrine. The deity alighted from its sedan, spoke in human language, and sat with sword in hand, ordering its attendants to seize the magistrate. It then commanded a ghostly servant to devour him.

As the magistrate was being seized, someone intervened, saying, "There is no need to devour him. Only invite the Great King to be the master of his household." The ghostly servant then hurled the magistrate into the air, and he suddenly found himself lost in a vast wilderness, unsure of the place. After searching for a path for several days, he finally encountered people and asked where he was. He was told it was over five thousand *li* from his home.

Day and night, he begged for directions to return but could not find the way. He only knew to seek out Longhushan in Xinzhou, intending to take refuge with the Celestial Master. As soon as the thought arose, true numinous spirits protected him, allowing him to survive. After more than four years, he finally reached Xinzhou. Before he could enter the mountain, he encountered a Daoist who, upon being questioned, said, "I am Master Xu Jing."

The magistrate knelt and bowed deeply, about to recount his tale, when Master Xu Jing said, "I already know all. There is no need to go to the mountain. How have you sustained yourself on the road, sir?" The magistrate replied, "I have only been able to practice fate-calculation." Master Xu Jing then bestowed upon him a mirror and a talisman—one to hang over his heart, the other to bind upon his left arm—and instructed him to depart. The magistrate hastened on his way, as if guided by unseen protection, covering over a hundred *li* a day without fatigue. In barely a year, he suddenly found himself in his hometown, as though led by an invisible hand. Upon reaching his door, he followed Master Xu Jing’s instructions precisely, still speaking only of fate-calculation. The household’s spirits and all its members came forth to observe his divination. As the magistrate conversed with them, the mirror suddenly trembled. He struck it with the talisman he had been given, and from the mirror leapt General Wen, accompanied by thunder, lightning, and a swirling black mist so dense it could not be gazed upon. After a long while, the storm cleared, revealing the slain body of a giant macaque and two smaller ones before the hall. The magistrate recounted all that had transpired, and only then did his family recall the events. The two smaller macaques had been born to his wife and concubine, though their names could not be remembered.

In recent years, Lu Yanghao came to Jiangxi and, while performing miracles in Linjiang Prefecture, encountered the Xiao family suffering from a malignant affliction. They had posted a reward seeking someone to cure it. Lu lodged at Huili Temple and conducted a spirit-summoning ritual. Each time he summoned a spirit, a boy would leap into the Moon Pavilion’s waters and not resurface, leaving the crowd in doubt. Lu summoned another, and this time the spirit seized the ritual officer’s sword and plunged into the depths. After a long while, the three emerged carrying a single fish head ashore, revealing it as the source of the Xiao family’s torment, and thus the illness was cured. Lu remarked to others, "Only when General Wen was dispatched did the ailment swiftly resolve."

Hong Yian, a renowned Daoist of the Inner Terrace in Dengdu, traveled with his disciple Zhong Yeyun to Jianning Prefecture. At the home of Huang Tongyao in Pucheng County’s Niutian, they encountered his young daughter suffering from demonic possession. Through spirit-summoning, they discerned that while serving in Min, two malevolent entities—one named Jiang Lang, the other Dai Dapo—had wrought havoc. The spirits were confined in a temple prison, but someone had broken the seals, allowing the fiends to escape. They then enlisted the aid of other demonic forces, transforming into crows and tigers that circled the temple, roaring and shrieking. No ritual could subdue them until the Ten Earth Deities’ method was employed, capturing them all. The spirits were bound, taken across the lake to the right, and their forms obliterated using the sinking-and-extinguishing method. Thus, it is known that the Earth Deities hold jurisdiction, and General Wen swiftly responds to such matters.

Here, I have gathered these accounts to supplement the omissions in the previous record. *Supplement to the Biography of General Wen, the Grand Protector, concludes.*
