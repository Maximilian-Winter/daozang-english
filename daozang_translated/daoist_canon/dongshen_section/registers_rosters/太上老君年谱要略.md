During the reign of the Heavenly Sovereign, the Lord descended into the world as Master Tongxuan, also styled the Great Master of the Mystic Center. Xu Zheng’s *Chronicle of the Three and Five* states: "The year began with *Sheti*, when primordial *qi* first arose, and a divine being appeared, known as the Heavenly Sovereign."

During the reign of the Earthly Sovereign, He descended as a teacher, styled Master Yougu. The *Apocrypha of the Spring and Autumn* records this as the "Nine-Headed Era."

During the reign of the Human Sovereign, He descended as a teacher, styled Master Pangu. The *Chronicle of the Three and Five* states: "Heaven and Earth were chaotic as a hen’s egg, and Pangu was born within. When Heaven and Earth parted, Pangu stood between them. Thereafter came the Three Sovereigns, the beginning of the Three Powers."

During the reign of Fuxi, He descended in the fields, styled Master Yuhua. During the reign of Zhurong, He descended on Mount Da, styled Master Guangshou. During the reign of Shennong, He descended in Jiyin, styled Master Dacheng. During the reign of the Yellow Emperor, He descended on Mount Kongtong, styled Master Guangcheng. During the reign of Shaohao, He again descended on Mount Kongtong, styled Master Suiying. During the reign of Emperor Zhuan, He descended on Mount Heng, styled Master Chijing. During the reign of Emperor Ku, He descended by the riverside, styled Master Lutuzhi.

The *Stele of the Green Sheep Palace* by Yue Penggui, Hanlin Academician of the Tang, states: "When Fuxi ruled all under Heaven, the Lord, in His great compassion, descended to guide him. Gazing upward, He observed the patterns of the celestial vault; looking downward, He discerned the principles of the earthly realm. He taught Fuxi to draw the Eight Trigrams, instructed him in the division of the Three Powers, aided him in creating written characters, and replaced the governance of knotted cords."

"When Shennong ruled all under Heaven, the Lord humbled Himself to save the age, descending as his teacher. He bestowed upon him the Five Movements, divided the Four Seasons, assisted in ordering the myriad affairs, and illuminated the distinctions among the hundred grains. He transformed the customs of drinking blood and eating raw flesh, altered the sounds of yellow banners and clay drums, and abolished cave-dwellings and tree-nests, raising halls and constructing dwellings."

"When the Yellow Emperor ruled all under Heaven, the Lord concealed Himself within Mount Kongtong, His mind roaming beyond the boundless void. The Emperor personally came to seek His counsel, bowing as student to teacher. He hastened to the corner of the hall in his court robes, then knelt to inquire of the Dao. He received the *Elixir Canon* at Wangwu and ascended to the azure heavens at Dinghu."

"When Shaohao ruled all under Heaven, the Lord expounded the canons of solemn reverence, teaching him to align with the seasons and welcome the *qi*, to harmonize with the divine luminaries. The feathered tribes displayed their auspiciousness, and He appointed the Bird Officials to govern, arranging the Nine Responses to oversee the hundred offices. The sun and moon conjoined in splendor, the phoenix presented the chart in its beak—all manifestations of the Supreme Dao, revealing the imperial model."

"When Emperor Zhuan ruled all under Heaven, the Lord taught him to resolve conflicts and govern the state, pacifying the people. He swept away the Nine Li, illuminated the Eight Kai, summoned the Six Jia, and commanded the hundred spirits. He instructed him in the subtle words of the scriptures and the great Way of compliance."

"When Emperor Ku ruled all under Heaven, the Lord spread the Dao and disseminated transformation, serving as the world’s teacher. He discoursed on the wondrous words of the *Yellow Court*, concealing the sun and evading the moon. He proclaimed the auspicious title of *Lu Tu*, shifting cities and relocating settlements. He established the names of the Nine Provinces and composed the *Six Harmonies* music."

During the reign of Emperor Yao, He descended on Mount Gushe, styled Master Wucheng. During the reign of Emperor Shun, He descended in Heyang, styled Master Yinshou. During the reign of Yu of Xia, He descended on Mount Shang, styled Master Zhenxing. During the reign of Tang of Yin, He descended on Mount Qian, styled Master Xize.

The above events are recorded in the *Genealogy of Emperors*, *Century of Emperors and Kings*, *Great Possession Scripture of the Dongshen Section*, *Jade Calendar Scripture*, *Records of the Northern Frontier*, *Master Yin’s Mystic Records*, Cui Xuanshan’s *Geographical Records*, Qiao Zhou’s *Investigations of Ancient History*, *Biographies of Divine Immortals*, and the *Illustrated Records of Commanderies and States*.

Though the Lord manifested in various forms to respond to the world and establish teachings, He would conceal Himself once His work was done. Thus, no record of His birth existed in the world.

In the *gengshen* year of King Yangjia, the eighteenth ruler of the Yin dynasty, He divided His radiance and transformed His *qi* from the Supreme Clarity immortal realm. Riding the essence of the sun and driving a nine-dragon chariot, He became a five-colored flowing pearl and entered the womb of the Mystic Jade Maiden of Tianshui, Lady Yin. After eighty-one years of gestation, on the fifteenth day of the second month in the *gengchen* year of King Wuding, the twenty-second ruler of Yin, He was born in Quren Village of Lai Township, Ku County in Bo—now the site of the Supreme Clarity Palace.

The Yin dynasty reckoned the new year from the *chou* month, so the fifteenth day of the second month in Yin corresponds to the Lantern Festival of today.

The *Stele of the Green Sheep Palace* states: "During the reign of Gaozong of Yin, at the time when King Wen of Zhou was expounding the *Book of Changes*, divine radiance flowed into the jade womb, and auspicious hues coalesced into golden bones. Unbroken and unblemished, His gestation extended over eighty years. Auspicious omens descended, surpassing the expected term by twenty thousand days."

In the *jiayin* year, after thirty-five years, one day He suddenly mounted a white deer, trod upon the cypress in the courtyard, and ascended to Heaven. The cypress from which He ascended to Heaven still stands in the Supreme Clarity Palace. Ouyang Wenzhong’s poem reads:
*"The green ox passed west through the pass,*
*Lord Lao then wrote the Five Thousand Words.*
*The white deer departed to ascend to Heaven,*
*Since then, three thousand years have swiftly passed.*
*The traces of that time remain even now,*
*The ancient cypress still stands, dark and tall."*

In the *dingmao* year of King Zhou, the Lord descended south of Mount Qi, styled Master Xieyi. At that time, King Wen of Zhou served as the Earl of the West and summoned Him as the Keeper of Archives. When King Wu conquered Yin, He was transferred to the position of Historian Beneath the Pillars.

In his *Eulogy for the Temple Courtyard*, Sui Dynasty Internal Scribe Xue Daoheng writes: From the time of Fuxi through the Zhou era, spanning countless years and dynastic changes, He altered His titles and names. During the reigns of Kings Wen and Wu, He served as Keeper of Archives and Historian Beneath the Pillars. Though courts and dynasties repeatedly shifted, His countenance remained unchanged.

In the reign of King Cheng, He was styled Master Jingcheng. In the reign of King Kang, He was called Master Guoshu, yet still held the post of Historian Beneath the Pillars. In the reign of King Zhao, He resigned His office and returned to Bo, and on the *renwu* day of the fifth month in the twenty-fifth year (*guichou*), He passed westward through Hangu Pass, where He instructed the Pass Prefect Yin Xi. In the following year (*jiayin*), He bestowed upon Xi the *Five Thousand Words of the Dao and Virtue*. That same year, in the fourth month, He ascended to Heaven from a small hill south of Xi’s residence, whereupon five-colored light pierced the Purple Tenuity, and all the well waters overflowed.

In the twenty-seventh year (*yimao*), He divided His radiance and was reborn into the household of Li Taiguan in Shu. By the twenty-ninth year (*dingsi*), He met Yin Xi at the Market of the Green Ram. The Tang records state: The Market of the Green Ram was the site of the Supreme Dark Prime Heavenly Sovereign’s second rebirth.

In the fourth year of King Mu (*jiashen*), He returned once more to the Central Kingdom, journeyed east to Fusang, met with the Great Emperor, and reviewed the ranks of the herb-gathering immortals. The *Inner Records of King Mu* recount: Hearing that Perfected Yin had attained the Dao and ascended, King Mu had the Louguan Tower constructed and appointed seven Daoists to maintain its rites.

In the first year of King Yi (*yichou*), Lord Lao and the Three Masters of Primordial Antiquity descended upon Three Learning Mountain in Mianzhu of Shu, where They transmitted the Dao to Li Zhenduo. In the twenty-first year of King Li (*gengzi*), Lord Lao descended upon Louguan and conferred upon Daoist Song Lun the *Middle Illumination Dao*, the *Scriptures of Penetrating Perfection*, the *Six Jia of Numinous Flight*, and the *Plain Memorials of Cinnabar Talismans*.

In the forty-third year of King Xuan (*bingchen*), Lord Lao descended upon the Wei River and warned the king that the Year Star would shift northward, foretelling the decline of Zhou. Two years later, King You ascended the throne. The Tang *Chart of Manifestations Through the Ages* states: During King Xuan’s reign, a firewood-gatherer sang as he walked, and none could understand him. When asked, Lord Lao replied, “This is a man of the living kingdom cultivating the Supreme Orthodox and Perfect Dao.”

In the second year of King You (*xinyou*), the earth quaked, and the Jing, Wei, and Luo Rivers trembled. Lord Lao said, “Zhou is about to decline; the count will not reach ten years.” Later, as foretold, Zhou was destroyed by the Quanrong.

In the twenty-third year of King Ping (*guimao*), in the twelfth month, Lord Lao again emerged from the Pass, enlightening the various states before journeying to the Western Flow and Linzhou, where He examined the ranks of the herb-gathering immortals. His work complete, He returned once more to the Central Kingdom. Recorded in the *Record of the Western Ascent*.

In the seventeenth year of King Jing (*wuxu*), Confucius said to Nangong Jingshu, “I have heard that one who is well-versed in antiquity yet comprehends the present, who fathoms the origins of ritual and music and illumines the return of virtue and the Dao—such a one is my teacher.” Together with Jingshu, he went to inquire of the rites.

In the second year of King Weilie (*dingwei*), Lord Lao passed through Qin. Duke Xian of Qin received him with reverence and presented him with a jade disc, seeking instruction on the celestial reckonings.

In the eighth year of King Xian (*gengshen*), Lord Lao journeyed east to Chicheng and Mengshan, passed Fusang, and examined the ranks of the herb-gathering immortals. Thereafter, He concealed Himself in the Tai and Shaoshi chambers of Mount Song.

In the ninth year of King Nan (*yimao*), King Zhao of Qin ascended the throne. Lord Lao, together with Yin Xi and other immortals, traveled west to Nüji, Jitou, and Tianzhu, then emerged again from the Hangu Pass. He ascended Kunlun and returned to the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace. Upon hearing of this, King Zhao ordered cities and towns to be established along Lord Lao’s route to mark His sacred passage, thus founding the Lao-ting Post and Yin Xi City. Recorded in the *Biography of the Heavenly Master* and the *Illustrated Classic of Shu*.

Lord Lao’s responses to the world were boundless, His transformations unfathomable. Ascending and descending, none could fully comprehend Him. Now, collating the various records and the extended calendar, we calculate that from the *gengchen* year of King Wuding of Yin to the *yimao* year of King Nan of Zhou, His appearances and withdrawals spanned nine hundred and ninety-six years—one hundred and seventy-four years in Yin and eight hundred and twenty-two years in Zhou—precisely aligning with historical annals and the various classics.

Emperor Ming of Wei praised Him, saying, “As Zhou’s Archivist, He endured nine hundred years.” The erudite scholar Wu Yangwu also remarked, “Lord Lao’s transformations and numinous responses are difficult to fathom. Born in the Shang, He also served in Zhou. Calculating His beginning and end, He endured a thousand years.” These all refer to the approximate count.

The *Records of the Historian* states that some say He lived one hundred and sixty years, others two hundred—these are estimates made by Confucius’s contemporaries regarding Lord Lao’s age, for they could not know the truth. Thus, each matter is prefaced with “perhaps” or “some say.”

Liu Xiang praised Him, saying, “His virtue harmonized with the primordial qi, His longevity matched the Two Modes.”

Though the various records differ in their accounts, none fail to extol His long life. Yet the Confucians, deeming the teachings of long life and ascension to heaven fantastical, merely state that none knew His end.

In the twenty-eighth year of the First Emperor of Qin (*renwu*), after performing the Feng and Shan sacrifices at Mount Tai, he established a shrine to Lord Lao south of the Louguan Terrace and personally performed the sacrificial rites.

At the beginning of Emperor Wen of Former Han’s reign, Lord Lao first descended by the banks of the Shan and Yellow Rivers. The people called Him the River Earl, also known as the River Venerable. The Emperor personally sought Him out, and Lord Lao bestowed upon him the two scriptures of the *Dao* and *Virtue*. To this day, north of Shan Prefecture stand the Temple of the River Earl and the Terrace for Gazing at Immortals. Recorded in the *Records of the Historian*.

In the first year of the *Han’an* era of Emperor Shun (*renwu*), Lord Lao descended upon Mount Heming in Shu, transmitting to the Heavenly Master Zhang Daoling the *Secret Register of Orthodox Unity and Numinous Might*.

In the first year of the *Yongshou* era of Emperor Huan (*yiwei*), Lord Lao descended upon Chengdu, transmitting to the Heavenly Master the methods of the Northern Dipper for excising death and inscribing life. The present Jade Bureau Transformation in Chengdu Prefecture marks the site. He also descended upon Mount Lutang, bestowing the texts for restraining the Six Heavens and decapitating demons. Recorded in the *Biography of the Heavenly Master* and the *Illustrated Classic of Shu*.

In the eighth year of the *Yanxi* era (*yisi*), the Emperor dispatched the Palace Attendant Zuo Guan to Ku County to sacrifice to Lord Lao, commanding Bian Shao to compose an inscription.

Witnessed by the assembled multitude, the event was memorialized to the throne. The congratulatory memorial stated: "His golden countenance and jade-like locks outshone the radiance of night’s luminaries. The white steed with crimson mane left traces as though treading upon the celestial steeds’ courtyard." Recorded in the memorial of Sun Rui, Gentleman for Court Audiences.

In the third year of the *Kaiyuan* era (*yimao*) of Emperor Xuanzong, upon his return from offering sacrifices at Mount Tai, he paid homage at the Laozi Temple in Bozhou. He personally transcribed the two scriptures of the *Dao* and *Virtue*, ordering them to be engraved upon stone. He designated Laozi’s birthday as the *Xuanyuan* Festival and composed a eulogy, inscribing it upon the lintel of the sacred canopy. Recorded in the *Veritable Records*.

In the intercalary fourth month of the twenty-ninth year of the *Kaiyuan* era (*xinsi*), the emperor dreamed that Laozi declared: "I have an image in the southwest of the capital." The emperor dispatched envoys to seek it, and indeed, they recovered a jade statue of Laozi. It was welcomed to the Xingqing Palace, where its true likeness was painted and distributed to the Kaiyuan Temples in all prefectures. Recorded in the *Comprehensive Mirror*.

In the first year of the *Tianbao* era (*renwu*), Laozi descended outside the Vermilion Phoenix Gate and spoke to Tian Tongxiu: "When I once entered the Flowing Sands, I concealed a golden casket with a sacred talisman in Yin Xi’s former residence.

Both events recorded in the *Old Book of Tang*.

In the second year of the *Zhide* era (*dingyou*) of Emperor Suzong, Laozi descended upon Yunlong Crag in Tonghua Commandery, his form bridging earth and heaven, his sacred image resplendent. An edict commanded its likeness to be painted, and Emperor Minghuang composed a eulogy: "By day his wondrous form appeared, floating in auspicious light. Daoists and Buddhists, gods and men, bowed in reverence and worship. The imperial command was given to adorn and depict it, displaying it throughout the commanderies." Recorded in *Preface to the Auspicious Image of the Most High Emperor*.

In the second year of the *Baoli* era (*bingchen*) of Emperor Jingzong, Laozi descended upon the imperial path before the Taiqing Palace. Recorded in the stele inscription by Liu Gongquan, composed by Wei Chuhou.

In the ninth month of the tenth year of the *Xiantong* era (*jichou*) of Emperor Yizong, the rebel Pang Xun of Xuzhou advanced upon Bozhou with over three thousand followers, intending to occupy the Taiqing Palace as a stronghold. At the time, several hundred officials and commoners had taken refuge within the palace. They all witnessed Laozi traversing the sky, and suddenly a black mist arose, disorienting the rebels, who trampled one another. Pang Xun drowned in the waters. Recorded in the memorial of Li Wei, Military Commissioner of Bianzhou.

In the seventh month of the second year of the *Guangming* era (*gengzi*) of Emperor Xizong, Huang Chao ravaged the commanderies and prefectures, preparing to burn the Taiqing Palace in Bozhou.
