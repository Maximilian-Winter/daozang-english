**The Record of Mystical Ranks**

**Scripture Title:** *The Record of Mystical Ranks* (五卷 *Five Scrolls*). Compiled by Zhang Tianyu of the Yuan dynasty. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, *Genealogical and Catalogical* Category.

**Preface to *The Record of Mystical Ranks***

The Grand Historian states: The Daoist school enables one’s spirit to achieve singular focus, moving in harmony with the formless, suffusing all things with tranquility—such is its art. It follows the great compliance of yin and yang, gathers the virtues of the Ru and Mo schools, and distills the essentials of the Ming and Fa traditions. Adapting to the times, responding to transformations in things, establishing customs, and applying affairs—there is nothing to which it is not fitting. Its principles are concise and easy to grasp; its affairs are few, yet its achievements many.

I have long been moved by this, wondering if there were truly no such persons—hidden and unseen—rendering the Grand Historian’s discourse unverifiable for later generations. Thus, I resolved to seek them among the ancients. From Laozi onward, among the disciples of Laozi, I have gathered their teachings on the Dao and virtue, their writings and arts, and arranged them by category. In this, I have dimly glimpsed such figures.

Formerly, Zhuangzi of Nanhua disparaged the Daoist defenders of the world yet revered Confucius without aligning with him. Now, in emulation of his intent, within this compilation, Laozi is not included—such is the utmost reverence. Yang Xiong said: "Confucius was sufficient in culture; Laozi was sufficient in the mystical." Therefore, I have titled it *The Mystical History*.

The origins of the imperial Daoist school are vast; the tracks of the Perfected Ones and the methods of establishing teachings for the world are its standards. The Grand Historian’s discourse has settled this, and I, Tianyu, aspire to study it.

Written on the fourteenth day of the ninth lunar month in the autumn of the *yihai* year by Zhang Tianyu, the Outer Historian of Juqu.

**Zhou Dynasty: The Rank of Dao and Virtue**

Yin Xi, a grandee of the Zhou, was adept in esoteric learning and constantly refined his essence and radiance. Concealing his virtue and cultivating his conduct, none of his contemporaries knew of him. When Laozi journeyed west, Yin Xi first perceived his dark aura and knew a Perfected One would pass by. He sought him out and indeed encountered Laozi. Laozi, recognizing his exceptional nature, composed for him the *Upper and Lower Chapters on Dao and Virtue* and transmitted them to him. Later, he accompanied Laozi to the Flowing Sands, where they consumed the seeds of *ju sheng*, and none knew their end. Yin Xi also authored nine scrolls, titled *The Master of Guanyin*. Liu Xiang praised its unadorned substance and boundless expanse, yet remarked that its models made men serene and light, never wild. Zhuangzi also recorded his words: "Within oneself, dwell in non-abiding; the forms of things manifest naturally. In motion, be like water; in stillness, like a mirror; in response, like an echo. Vast as if vanished, silent as if pure. Those who harmonize with it find accord; those who attain it arrive first. Never preceding others, yet ever following them." He was hailed as a Perfected One of ancient vastness, originally styled Master Wenshi.

Yin Gui, styled Gongdu, was a native of Taiyuan and the younger cousin of Master Wenshi. Well-versed in the Five Classics, he was especially enlightened in celestial patterns and apocryphal charts.

Upon receiving over a hundred Daoist scriptures, Yin Gui regularly consumed yellow essence* and practiced its regimen. Initially, Master Wenshi encountered Laozi at Hangu Pass during the reigns of King Kang and King Zhao of Zhou. He built a thatched hut on Mount Zhongnan, which King Mu later renovated into a towered abode—the Louguan—to await men of the Dao. Yin Gui then joined the recluse Du Chong in cultivating that site, attaining the Dao as the Perfected One of Grand Harmony.

Du Chong, styled Xuanyi, was a native of Gaojing. Upon hearing of Master Wenshi’s transcendence in the *dingsi* year of King Zhao’s reign, he settled at Lingzhai to study the Dao. At that time, five recluses and scholars arrived from afar, all marked by silence, emptiness, and lofty refinement. Their arts of the Dao were mutually forgotten, and together they upheld the unassuming principle. Thus, King Mu had the abode repaired, established a shrine, and appointed Chong as its Daoist master. At over one hundred and twenty years of age, he attained the Dao and ascended, styled the Perfected One of the Supreme Ultimate.

Xin Jue, also named Jiran, was a native of Puyang in Kuiqiu. A disciple of Laozi, his learning was boundless. King Ping of Chu asked: “I hear you received the Dao from Laozi—may I be enlightened?” He replied: “The Dao and virtue rectify the crooked to make it straight, quell chaos to restore order, and revive pure virtue to pacify the realm. The crux lies in one man. Thus, accumulating virtue makes a king; accumulating resentment, ruin. Yao and Shun prospered by this; Jie and Zhou perished by it.” The king said: “I reverently heed your counsel.”

Later, Xin journeyed south to Wu and Yue, where Fan Li became his disciple. When Yue planned to attack Wu, Fan admonished: “My master said: ‘War is an inauspicious instrument; battle, a perversion of virtue. Contention is but the last resort. To plot in secret and delight in inauspicious tools, testing oneself in such extremes—this must not be.’” Goujian ignored him and was defeated at Fujiao. Later, Fan declined a ministerial post and withdrew to Mount Yu in Wuxing. There, he composed twelve scrolls under the name *Wenzi*, its doctrines all rooted in Laozi. Liu Zihou once edited it, elucidating its meaning: “The spirit is the wellspring of wisdom; when the spirit is clear, wisdom is bright. Wisdom is the storehouse of the heart; when wisdom is impartial, the heart is at peace.” He also wrote: “In higher learning, listen with the spirit; in middling learning, with the heart; in lower learning, with the ears.” And: “Observe what the noble promote, what the wealthy desire, and what the poor endure.” And: “Human nature seeks equilibrium; desires harm it.” These too are the scales of *Wenzi*. During the Tianbao era, he was styled the Perfected One of Penetrating Mystery, and his work titled *The True Scripture of Penetrating Mystery*.

Lu Tong, known as Jieyu the Madman of Chu, favored nurturing life. He foraged the fruits of *chonglu* trees and seeds of turnips. Wandering famous mountains for centuries, he was still seen by men. When Confucius traveled to Chu, Jieyu sang as he passed: “O phoenix, phoenix! How your virtue has declined! The past cannot be admonished; the future may yet be pursued. Desist, desist! Those who govern today are doomed.” Confucius alighted, wishing to speak with him, but Jieyu hastened away, and Confucius could not engage him.

Geng Sangchu, a man of Chen, served Laozi and grasped his Dao in part. Dwelling on Mount Weilei, he dismissed ministers who were cunningly clever and distanced concubines who were cloyingly kind. Only the ungainly and the indolent remained. After three years, Weilei flourished. Later, he wandered to Wu, secluding himself on Meng Peak in Piling, where the Dongling Abbey now stands. He wrote nine scrolls, titled *Geng Sangzi*, also called *Kangcangzi*. His work was lost until Wang Bao presented it during the Kaiyuan era of Tang, whereupon he was enfeoffed as the Perfected One of Cavernous Spirit, and his book titled *The True Scripture of Cavernous Spirit*.

Nanrong Chu sought Laozi, who asked: “Why have you come with so many?” Chu glanced fearfully behind him. Laozi said: “Do you not understand my meaning?” Chu bowed, looked up, and sighed: “Now I have forgotten my reply and thus lost my question.” Laozi asked: “What do you mean?” He said: “If I am ignorant, men call me a fool. If I am wise, I am troubled. If my conduct is unkind, I harm others; if kind, I am troubled. If unjust, I injure them; if just, I am troubled. How can I escape this?” Laozi said: “Can you embrace the One? Can you not lose it? Can you forsake others and seek within? Can you be unassuming? Compassionate? Childlike? A child moves without knowing its actions, walks without knowing its destination. Its body is like a withered branch; its heart, dead ashes. In this state, fortune does not arrive, nor does misfortune. Without fortune or misfortune, how can there be calamity?”

Initially, Chu studied under Geng Sangzi, who said: “My talent is meager and insufficient to transform you. Why not journey south to see Laozi?” Thus, Chu sought Laozi, saying: “I wish to ask through Chu.” Yin Wen studied Laozi’s Dao and wore the Huashan cap as his emblem. His Way was unburdened by convention and unadorned by things. He desired the world’s peace to preserve lives, seeking only sufficiency in nurturing self and others. He saw insult as no disgrace and strove to end strife, halt wars, and save the world from conflict. With this, he journeyed the realm, persuading rulers and teaching the people, never forgetting the world. He wrote two scrolls, titled *Yin Wenzi*.

Shi Chengqi, a recluse of Zhou, traveled a thousand *li* with weary feet to see Laozi, saying: “I hear you are a sage. I have come without hesitation from afar—may I ask how to cultivate the self?” Laozi replied: “The Dao is not exhausted in greatness nor abandoned in smallness. Vast, it contains all things.”

Profound indeed, unfathomable in its depths.

The perfected person exhausts the true nature of things and abides in their root. Thus, they transcend heaven and earth, forsake the myriad beings, yet their spirit is never wearied. Shi Chengqi gained insight from this.

Cui Qu, a worthy minister of Zhou, asked Laozi: “Without governing the world, how may one settle the human heart?” Laozi replied: “Take heed—do not disturb the human heart. The human heart presses downward yet strives upward, trapped between above and below, searing like fire, congealing like ice, swift as a glance. Though you traverse beyond the four seas, its dwelling is deep and still; its movement, suspended like heaven. Fierce and proud, it cannot be bound—is there anything like the human heart?

Long ago, the Yellow Emperor first used benevolence and righteousness to disturb the human heart. This spread to the Three Kings, and the world was greatly alarmed. Then joy and anger bred suspicion, the foolish and the wise deceived one another, the good did not reproach, and lies and truth mocked each other—thus the world declined. Great virtue diverged, and the nature and destiny of things dissolved into chaos. The world prized cunning, and the people exhausted themselves in pursuit.

Thereupon, saws and axes were fashioned, inked cords and blades were wielded, hammers and chisels were employed—and the world fell into utter disorder. The fault lay in disturbing the human heart.” Laozi, grieving over the decline of virtue, thus startled the age through Cui Qu’s question.

Bo Ju, a minister of Zhou, studied under Laozi. Traveling in Qi, he saw an executed criminal. Removing his court robes, he covered the body, wailed to heaven, and cried: “Alas, sir! In the world there is a great net—why were you the first to be ensnared? It is said: ‘Do not steal, do not kill.’ Yet when honor and disgrace are established, suffering becomes visible; when wealth and goods accumulate, strife becomes visible. To exhaust and afflict the people without respite—how could they not reach this state?

The rulers of old held that success lay with the people and failure with themselves, that uprightness lay with the people and crookedness with themselves. Thus, if even one thing lost its proper form, they withdrew and took blame upon themselves. Now it is not so: they conceal their faults and deceive the ignorant, magnify difficulties and punish the blameless, heap burdens and impose unbearable penalties, lengthen the path and inflict distant punishments. When the people’s strength is spent, they resort to falsehood; day by day, deceit multiplies, and false scholars emerge—how could the people not be false?

When strength is insufficient, they feign; when wisdom is lacking, they deceive; when wealth is wanting, they steal. To whom can blame for theft and robbery be justly assigned?” Bo Ju’s words drew much from Laozi.

Lie Yukou, a man of Zheng, lived at the same time as Duke Nian of Zheng. His learning took the Yellow Emperor and Laozi as its foundation. He dwelt in the gardens of Zheng for forty years, yet no one recognized him. Initially, he served Master Huqiu; later, he studied under Old Master Shang and befriended Bohun Wuren. After nine years of advancing in the Way of these two masters, he could ride the wind and travel.

His disciple Yan Hui asked: “Is it for wealth that those who seek the Way do so?” Liezi replied: “Jie and Zhou prized profit and scorned the Way—thus they perished.”

Liezi was poor, his countenance bearing the hue of hunger. A guest spoke of him to Zi Yang of Zheng, saying: “Lie Yukou is surely a man of the Way. That he dwells in your state yet suffers poverty—could it be that you do not esteem scholars?” Zi Yang immediately ordered an official to send him grain. Liezi went out to meet the messenger, bowed twice, and declined. The messenger departed, and Liezi entered. His wife gazed at him and beat her breast, saying: “I have heard that the wife and children of one who possesses the Way all enjoy ease and happiness. Now you bear the look of hunger, and the lord, learning of your plight, offers you food—yet you refuse. Is this not fate?”

Liezi laughed and said to her: “The lord does not know me himself; he sent me grain on another’s word. He may also punish me on another’s word—this is why I did not accept.” In the end, the people indeed rose in rebellion and killed Zi Yang.

The original work once comprised twenty chapters. Liu Xiang removed duplicates, preserving eight, which he titled *Daoist Works*. The Daoist school grasps the essential and holds to the root, embracing clarity, emptiness, and non-action. In cultivating the self, it esteems non-contention, aligning with the Six Classics.

During the Tang Kaiyuan era, the text was designated *The Perfect Scripture of Supreme Emptiness and Utmost Virtue*. In the Song Xuanhe reign, Liezi was posthumously styled *Perfected Lord of Supreme Emptiness and Wondrous Mystery*.

Zhuang Zhou, styled Zixiu, served as the warden of Meng and Qi gardens during the reign of King Hui of Liang. His learning knew no bounds, yet its essence returned to the words of Laozi. Thus, his writings, totaling over a hundred thousand words, were largely parables. When King Wei of Chu heard of his worth, he dispatched envoys with lavish gifts to summon him, offering the position of minister. Zhuang Zhou laughed and said to the messengers: “A thousand gold pieces are a great profit; the office of minister is a lofty rank. Have you not seen the sacrificial ox at the suburban rites? Fed for years, adorned with embroidered robes, it is led into the great temple. At that moment, if it wished to be a lone piglet, could it do so? Go quickly, and do not defile me—I will never serve, that my will may be fulfilled.”

His book is titled *Zhuangzi*. He himself said: “Still and formless, ever-changing and constant. Death and life, heaven and earth, all move with the divine. Vast and boundless—where do they go? Sudden and fleeting—where do they turn? All things are encompassed, yet none can be taken as refuge.” The ancient guardians of the Way dwelt in this, and Zhuang Zhou opened its wind and delighted in it. With subtle and distant sayings, wild and unbounded words, and speech without limits, he gave free rein to his thoughts, never constrained by rigid form. Seeing the world as too turbid for solemn discourse, he used indirect speech to expand meaning, weighty words to convey truth, and parables to broaden reach. Alone, he roamed with the spirit of heaven and earth, yet did not disdain the myriad things. He set aside right and wrong to dwell among世俗. Though his book may seem flawed, its flow is unbroken and harmless. Though its words may vary, their strangeness is worth beholding.

His fullness cannot be restrained. Above, he roams with the Creator; below, he befriends those beyond life and death, without beginning or end. In its fundamentals, it is vast and expansive, deep and unbridled. In its lineage, it may be called harmonious and supremely accomplished. Yet in responding to transformation and dissolving attachments, its principle is inexhaustible, its coming unchanging. Vast and obscure—its depths remain unfathomed.

According to the *Zhen Gao*, Zhuang Zhou studied under Master Chang Sang, receiving his esoteric teachings, which became the *Zhuangzi*. He secluded himself on Mount Baodu. Later, he was posthumously appointed Compiler of the Supreme Ultimate Chamber, and his book was titled *The True Scripture of Southern Florescence*. In the Song Xuanhe reign, he was further styled *Perfected Lord of Subtle Mystery and Primordial Penetration*.

Fan Li, styled Shaobo, was a native of Xu. He studied under Grand Duke Wang and favored drinking water. Later, he followed Master Jiran and became a minister of Yue. He once said that human affairs must align with heaven and earth to succeed. After assisting Goujian in defeating Wu, he sighed: “The strategies of Jiran were ten, and I used five to achieve my aim. Having applied them to the state, I now wish to apply them to my household.” He then boarded a small boat and drifted upon the Five Lakes, changing his name. In Qi, he became known as Master Zheyi Zi Pi. Over a hundred years later, he reappeared in Tao, where he became Lord Zhu, amassing wealth in the hundreds of millions, and was called Lord Tao Zhu. He aided impoverished friends and kin, then returned to Lanling to sell medicine. Later generations continued to recognize him.

Guiguzi was a recluse of the Zhou era who dwelt in Guigu Valley and took it as his name. He had no known hometown, clan, or given name. His writings likely emerged during the Warring States period. Where the *Book of Changes*, *Laozi*, and *Yinfu* fell short, Guiguzi fully grasped and revealed their secrets. Was he not a hero of his age? His words include: “The world has no constant honor; the scholar has no constant teacher.” And: “When others act, I am still; when others speak, I listen. Knowing one’s nature lessens burdens; knowing fate dispels sorrow.” Such sayings are truly remarkable. As for works like *Nurturing the Spirit* and *Cultivating the Will*, which probe the roots of virtue and power and trace the footsteps of the divine—do they not approach the profound?

Guo Pu’s *Poems of Roaming Immortals* says:
*A thousand fathoms deep in Blue Stream,*
*A Daoist dwells within.*
*If you ask who he is,*
*They say: Guiguzi.*
Truly, this evokes his memory.

Xu Guang notes: In Yangcheng of Yingchuan, there is a Guigu Valley. Those who annotated his works include Huangfu Mi, Tao Hongjing, and Yin Zhizhang. Zhizhang was a Tang scholar.

Jueguanzi was a native of Chu during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. He lived in seclusion, wearing tattered clothes and worn shoes, his hat made of pheasant feathers, his name and lineage unknown. His writings expounded Daoist matters, his learning rooted in the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Yet his ambitions to roam and contend across the world never waned for a day—enough to glimpse a fraction of his intent. His book states: “When petty men serve their lord, they strive to blind his clarity, deafen his hearing, exploit his authority, and scorch the world. Heaven is high and hard to reach; blessings cannot be begged, nor misfortunes averted.” Such words show he had not yet detached from this world. Yet he also said: “The phoenix is the essence of yang; the qilin, the essence of yin. The myriad people are the essence of virtue.” Alas, how divine! Jia Yi’s *Rhapsody on the Roc* borrowed heavily from his language.

*Daoist Lineages*

Guo Sichao, a native of Yan State. Among four brothers, all attained the Dao. Sichao, the eldest, resided on Huayang’s Leiping Mountain, where he cultivated five fruits. The land there also bore *nai* pears—those of the Blessed Realm—used to dispel calamities and pestilence. Before his abode lay a pond, dug by Sichao himself. He would often sail a small boat upon it, striking the gunwale to sing:

**I.**
A limpid pool girds the numinous peak,
Endless woods flourish in emerald lush.
Black crows soar o’er the secluded wilds,
Words of ease flow with unhurried grace.
Plying the oars upon sacred waves,
I bow, yearning for the morning breeze.
Yet the hour of liberation eludes—
Carefree, I stand amid the forest’s shade.

**II.**
Beyond the Nine Abysses, waves divine,
I delve the Dao to grasp the Golden Truth.
Furl now the spirit-phoenix’s wings,
Conceal my radiant dragon scales.
A thing of but a square inch’s span,
Ten thousand gusts are but dust and grime.
Pity the mayfly bride of dawn—
Who could exhaust your chariot’s load?

**III.**
Roaming the void, the wind whistles past,
Spirit-steps tread the formless realm.
The round sun gleams with radiant mist,
Nine phoenixes hymn the dawn’s first light.
Glorious pinions fan the River of Heaven,
Mists and felicitous clouds take flight.
Thus I reach the Great Subtlety’s halls,
Embracing this golden nectar divine.
Beyond the dark abyss, I wander free—
Neither existing nor ceasing to be.

**IV.**
I mount the clouds to dance in the Divine Empyrean,
Clad in auroras, girded with the nine suns.
The High Emperor shares the dragon’s chariot,
Thus I arrive at the Northern Flowery Chamber.
Spirit tigers dwell in the jade groves,
Wind and clouds merge as one.
The gates of darkness and obscurity open—
Wondrous transformations leave no trace.

After attaining the Dao, he ascended to serve as Left Immortal Duke of the Nine Palaces, overseeing the Jade Terrace as Bearer of the Canopy. The *Scriptures of the Xuanhe Era* record: “The Three Blacks conceal the numinous, far beyond the reach of names or words. The myriad spirits congeal in transformation, defying all conjecture or inquiry. Those who eulogize the Supreme Perfected truly expand the boundless Dao.”

The Venerable Perfected Guo, Attendant Gentleman of the Jade Terrace, his merits spanning the Ten Ultimates, ranked among the Nine Palaces, bearing the Radiant Jade of the Cinnabar Field. Already he soars through the Great Ultimate, supporting the canopy of the Flourishing Morn, and thus attends the August Void Sovereign, grandly unfolding the Primal Net. It is fitting to exalt him with a resplendent title. Awaiting his ascension to the Uncarved Simplicity, may he forever safeguard the Prosperous Plan.

Be it decreed: Let him be specially enfeoffed as the Perfected of Preserving Brilliance of the Grand Tenuity.

Jiang Shumao, in the Qin era, was enfeoffed as Marquis of Baling. He withdrew into Mount Juqu, where he cultivated the five fruits and the five pungent herbs, selling them to purchase cinnabar for his alchemical work. Even now, among the mountains, leeks and mallows still grow—are these not the remnants of his seeds? After attaining transcendence, he once wrote to the officials of the Great Ultimate Palace, saying: “Formerly, I studied the Dao in Guigu, attained it in Shaoshi, nurtured my wings in Huayang, and awaited my ascension in the Realm of Leisure. At times, I ride the whirlwind chariot, reveling in the joys of Juqu. I awaken to the swiftness of the eons’ passing—things endure while men perish. What labor is mine to bear?”

During the Western Han, the Daoist adept Zhang Liang, styled Zifang, was originally a man of Han. When Qin annihilated Han, Liang, using his family’s wealth, sought assassins to stab the King of Qin and avenge Han. As his family had served as Han’s ministers for five generations, Liang had long studied ritual in Huaiyang. Traveling east, he met the Lord of the Azure Sea and obtained a stalwart warrior, who forged an iron mace weighing one hundred and twenty catties. When the King of Qin made his eastern progress to Bolangsha, Liang and his retainer ambushed him, but the mace struck the escort carriage instead. Enraged, the King of Qin sought the assailants with great urgency. Liang then changed his name and concealed himself in Xiapi.

Once, Liang was strolling leisurely on the bridge at Xiapi when an old man in coarse cloth approached him. The elder deliberately dropped his shoe beneath the bridge and, turning to Liang, said: “Boy, go down and fetch my shoe.” Liang was startled and wished to strike him, but seeing his age, he forcibly restrained himself, descended, retrieved the shoe, and knelt to present it. The old man placed his foot to receive it and said: “This boy is teachable. Meet me here at dawn in five days.” Liang, finding this strange, knelt and replied: “Yes.”

At dawn five days later, Liang arrived, but the old man was already there. Angrily, he said: “Why are you late?” Five days later, Liang went at cock’s crow, yet the old man had again arrived first. Once more, he chided: “Why are you late?” After another five days, Liang went at midnight. After a short while, the old man arrived and, pleased, said: “It should be thus.” He produced a scroll and said: “Read this, and you shall become the teacher of kings. Ten years hence, you will prosper. Thirteen years later, you will see me beneath Mount Gucheng in Jibei—the Yellow Stone is I.” Then he vanished.

At daybreak, Liang examined the scroll and found it to be the *Military Methods of the Grand Duke*. Astonished, he studied and practiced it diligently. While residing in Xiapi, he engaged in knight-errantry and persuaded the Lord of Pei, who delighted in his counsel and frequently employed his strategies, ultimately using them to conquer the realm. When he followed the High Emperor to establish the capital in Guanzhong, Liang, afflicted by many ailments, practiced guiding and pulling exercises, abstained from grains, and secluded himself behind closed doors.

Over a year later, the Emperor wished to depose the Crown Prince and install the son of Lady Qi, Prince Ruyi of Zhao. Empress Lü consulted Liang, who then summoned the Four Elders of Mount Shang. When the Crown Prince served them wine, they remained until the feast’s end, ensuring the Prince’s position was not altered—this was Liang’s strategy, aided by the Four Elders. Liang then declared: “My family served as ministers to Han for generations. When Han fell, I spared no expense of ten thousand gold to avenge it. Now, with a three-inch tongue, I have become the teacher of an emperor, enfeoffed with ten thousand households and ranked among the marquises. This is the utmost for a commoner, and it suffices for me. I wish to abandon worldly affairs and wander with Master Red Pine.” Thus, he studied the Dao, desiring to ascend lightly. Upon his death, he was posthumously titled Marquis Wen of Liu.

Thirteen years after first meeting the old man on the bridge, Liang passed through Jibei with the High Emperor and indeed found the Yellow Stone beneath Mount Gucheng. He took it and treasured it, offering sacrifices to it. When Liang died, he was buried together with the Yellow Stone, and during seasonal sacrifices at his tomb, offerings were also made to the Yellow Stone. The Tianshou Abbey in Chenliu County became the site of his veneration. In the Song era, during the Zhenghe reign, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected of Soaring Emptiness.

Cao Can was a native of Pei. During the Qin era, he served as a prison warden, while Xiao He was the chief clerk, both prominent officials in the county. When the High Ancestor became the Lord of Pei, Can followed him as a Gentleman of the Interior. In the first year of Emperor Hui’s reign, Can was appointed Chancellor of Qi. As Chancellor of Qi, he governed seventy cities. With the realm newly pacified and King Daohui of Qi young and vigorous, Can summoned all the elders and scholars to inquire how to pacify and unite the people. The former scholars of Qi, numbering in the hundreds, each offered different opinions, leaving Can uncertain of what to adopt.

Hearing that Master Gai of Jiaoxi expounded the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, Can sent an envoy with generous gifts to invite him. Master Gai explained that the essence of governance lay in valuing tranquility, so that the people would naturally settle. He expounded on this principle in detail. Thereupon, Can yielded the main hall to Master Gai. In his governance, he chiefly employed the methods of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Thus, as Chancellor of Qi for nine years, he brought peace and unity to the state, earning great renown as a worthy minister.

Later, when Chancellor He passed away, Can succeeded him, altering nothing and faithfully adhering to He’s established policies. He governed with leniency, magnanimity, and tranquility, becoming a model for the realm. After serving as Chancellor for three years, he died and was posthumously titled Marquis Yi. The people composed a song: “Xiao He made the laws, clear and uniform as a painting. Cao Can succeeded him, preserving them without loss. Upholding his tranquility, the people found peace and unity.”

**Daoist Virtues**

Sima Jizhu, a man of Chu, practiced divination in the eastern market of Chang’an. Song Zhong served as a Grand Master, while Jia Yi held the post of Academician. On the same day, both left to bathe and rest, and as they walked together, they discussed and recited the arts of the Way of the former kings and sages, delving deeply into human nature. Gazing at each other, they sighed.

Jia Yi said, “I have heard that the sages of antiquity, if not in the court, must have been among the finest physicians.” The two then rode together to the market and wandered among the divination stalls. The sky had just rained, and the streets were quiet. Sima Jizhu sat at leisure, with three or four disciples attending him, expounding on the Way of Heaven and Earth, the movements of the sun and moon, and the roots of yin and yang, fortune and misfortune.

The two officials bowed twice and paid their respects. Jizhu observed their appearance and bearing, which seemed learned, so he received them with courtesy and had his disciples invite them to sit. Once seated, Jizhu resumed his earlier discourse. Zhong and Yi, suddenly enlightened, straightened their robes and sat upright, saying, “Gazing upon your bearing, Master, and listening to your words, we humble ones have observed the world, yet never witnessed the like. Why then do you dwell in such lowliness, and why are your deeds so base?”

Jizhu clutched his belly and laughed heartily, saying, “I see that you gentlemen appear to possess the arts of the Way—why then are your words so vulgar and your speech so coarse? Now, whom does the Son of Heaven deem worthy? And whom does he exalt?”

"Why then do you, an elder, dwell in such lowliness and baseness, while you, sirs, speak only of exalting rank and emolument, and disparaging divination and prognostication?"

Jizhu expounded at length for several hundred words, weaving in and out of the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi, all deeply illuminating the Dao and its virtue, to demonstrate how divination and prognostication benefit humanity.

Zhong and Yi, suddenly disconcerted, lost their composure and fell silent, unable to speak. They bowed twice and took their leave. Emerging from the market gate, they could barely mount their chariots, leaning forward over the crossbar with heads bowed, scarcely able to breathe.

Three days later, Song encountered Jia outside the palace gates. Drawing him aside into seclusion, they sighed to one another, saying, "The higher the Dao, the greater the peace; the higher the power, the greater the peril. Dwelling in such resplendent authority, the loss of one’s person may come any day.

To divine without careful consideration is to fail to perceive the loss of essence. To counsel a ruler without careful consideration is to leave oneself nowhere to stand. The distance between these is as vast as heaven and earth. It is like wearing a heavenly crown with earthly sandals.

This is what Laozi meant by 'the nameless'—the origin of the ten thousand things. Heaven and earth stretch boundlessly, and all things flourish in abundance. Some find peace, others peril—none know where to abide.

What concern are we to them? The longer they endure, the more secure they become. Even the righteousness of the Zeng clan offers no difference."

After Song Zhong failed to reach the Xiongnu on his mission and returned to face punishment, Jia Yi served as tutor to King Liang Huai, who fell from his horse and died. Jia Yi refused to eat, consumed by grief and resentment, and perished—such are those who sever their roots in pursuit of mere ornament.

According to the *Zhen Gao*: Later, Master Ji entered the stone chamber of Mount Weiyu, where he received the essence of stone and the golden radiance of light. Concealing his luminous form and transforming his appearance, he followed the methods of Xiling Zidu. As he prepared to depart, he left behind an effigy upon his pillow and mat to serve as his likeness in his stead.

His tomb lies south of Mount Pan in Chengdu of Shu Commandery. In former times, Zhuge Wuhou erected a stele before Master Ji’s grave, inscribing his virtue. The closing eulogy of the stele reads:

*"The profound void, the great stillness,
Merging yin and yang.
Heaven and earth intermingle in flux,
The ten thousand beings flourish in abundance.
The Master’s principles were set forth,
Distinguishing soft and hard.
Spirits and gods beheld them,
The Six Perfections made manifest."*

Master Ji had one son and one daughter, both of whom attained the Dao. His son was named Fayu, and his daughter Jihua, and both dwelled within Mount Weiyu. Master Ji studied the *Jade Scripture*, ingested the radiance of luminous cinnabar, and embraced the dawn’s glow. Now, his complexion remains that of a maiden of twenty, and his beard, three feet long, is black as ink.

Such is the Way of the Eastern Minister—truly a marvel. The transformations of the Dao.

East Fangxiao, styled Manqian, was a native of Moci in Pingyuan. For decades, he served as a scribe in the imperial archives, and during the reign of Emperor Wu, he submitted a memorial on expediency, for which he was appointed Gentleman of the Palace. By the time of King Zhao, some called him a sage, others an ordinary man. His conduct ranged from profound to shallow, from overt to subtle; his words were sometimes loyal counsel, sometimes jest, and none could fathom his intent. At the beginning of Emperor Xuan’s reign, he resigned his post as Gentleman to escape the turmoil of the age, leaving behind his official lodgings as if carried away by the wind. Later, he was seen selling medicine in Kuaiji, and those who knew him by the Five Lakes suspected him to be the essence of the Star of Longevity.

Xiahou Zhan eulogized his likeness, saying:
*"Vast and luminous, embracing the great,
He outshone ministers and mocked the mighty.
None could surpass him, nor tread upon his path.
He scorned the powerful, yet in lowliness knew no sorrow.
He jested with emperors as with peers,
And ranked the noble as mere grass.
His heroic spirit surpassed all,
His lofty qi towered above the world—
Truly, one who stood beyond the bounds of common wandering."*

Yang Xiong also deemed Fangxiao expansive and multifaceted, defying a single label. He seemed a jester yet was inexhaustible, appeared wise yet was unconstrained, offered forthright remonstrance yet was licentious, and feigned madness to conceal his virtue. Neither Boyi nor Shuqi, but rather akin to Liuxia Hui, he warned his son that to "uphold appearances" was to make Mount Shouyang seem clumsy and the pillar beneath the hall seem skillful. To eat one’s fill and stroll at ease was to trade farming for office. He played the hermit while engaging the world, eluded the times with cunning, and was, in truth, the master of jest. Yan Lugong’s *Eulogy in Painting* and the inscription on the reverse of the stele are both preserved in Dezhou.

The Daoist and Confucian traditions—
Sima Tan, whose ancestors served as grand historians of the Zhou court, became Grand Historian himself. He studied astronomy under Tang Du, the *Book of Changes* under Yang He, and Daoist discourse under Master Huang, serving during the Jianyuan and Yuanfeng eras. Lamenting that scholars failed to grasp the essence of learning and blindly followed their teachers, he expounded the essentials of the Six Schools, saying:

The *Great Commentary* of the *Book of Changes* states: *"The world shares one goal though a hundred paths diverge; all converge though routes differ."* The Yin-Yang, Confucian, Mohist, Legalist, School of Names, and Daoist schools—each seeks governance, differing only in their approach and whether they grasp or miss the mark.

Examining the Yin-Yang school, its methods are exhaustive yet rife with taboos, constraining people with excessive fear. Yet its adherence to the great sequence of the four seasons must not be lost. The Confucians are broad but lack focus, laborious yet ineffective, making their teachings difficult to fully realize. Nevertheless, their establishment of rituals between ruler and minister, father and son, and the distinctions between husband and wife, elder and younger, must not be altered. The Mohists are frugal but hard to follow, so their practices cannot be universally adopted. Yet their emphasis on strengthening the root and moderating expenditures must not be abandoned. The Legalists are stern and unyielding, yet their clarification of the hierarchy between ruler and minister, superior and subordinate, must not be changed. The School of Names is sparing but prone to losing sight of reality, yet its rectification of names and actualities must not go unexamined.

The Daoists practice *wuwei* (non-action), yet it is also said they practice *wu buwei* (non-non-action). Their methods are easy to implement but their words difficult to comprehend. Their art takes emptiness and nothingness as its foundation, and compliance as its function. Without fixed power or constant form, it can thoroughly investigate the nature of the ten thousand things. Neither preceding nor following things, it can thus serve as their master. With or without laws, it adapts to the times; with or without measures, it responds to circumstances. Thus, the sage is everlasting, adhering to the changes of the age. Emptiness is the constant of the Dao; compliance is the guiding principle of the ruler. When all ministers arrive, each is allowed to clarify their own path."

The essence that aligns with its sound is called *duan* (proper alignment). The essence that does not align with its sound is called *qin* (discord). When discordant words are not heeded, treachery does not arise. The worthy and the unworthy, black and white, become distinct—what is manifest lies in what one chooses to employ. What endeavor cannot then be accomplished? Thus, one merges with the great Dao, blending into obscurity, illuminating the world, and returning to namelessness.

All men are born with spirit as their essence and form as their vessel. When spirit is overused, it is exhausted; when form is overtaxed, it decays. When spirit and form separate, death ensues. The dead cannot be revived, nor can the sundered be reunited—thus the sage holds this in reverence. From this perspective, spirit is the root of life, and form its instrument. Without first stabilizing spirit and form, how can one claim, "I have the means to govern the world"? By what means indeed?

When Master Qian passed from the world, his family recorded his teachings.

Daoist transformation:
Mei Fu, styled Zizhen, was a native of Shouchun in Jiujiang. In his youth, he studied in Chang’an, mastering the *Shangshu*, *Guliang Chunqiu*, and served as a literary scholar in the commandery, later appointed as a magistrate in Nanchang. During the reign of Emperor Cheng, he was entrusted to the Grand General Wang Feng. The Wang clan monopolized power and dominated the court, and though omens of disaster appeared repeatedly, none among the officials dared speak forthrightly. Mei Fu submitted three memorials, vigorously expounding on the gains and losses of Qin and Han, citing the *Song of the Tenth Month* as a warning against excess and decline. He criticized the overweening power of the imperial consort’s clan. His words were earnest and impassioned, yet the emperor did not heed them, and Emperor Cheng soon perished without an heir. Mei Fu believed it proper to establish the Three Sequences and enfeoff the descendants of Confucius as the successors of Yin. He submitted another memorial, tracing ancient texts and using the *Zuozhuan*, *Guliang*, and *Liji* to clarify that the lineage of Confucius should be made successors to Tang. Thereupon, an edict was issued, enfeoffing the descendants of Confucius as the Duke of Shaoja of Yin.

At that time, Mei Fu lived at home, devoting himself to reading and cultivating his nature. During the *Yuanshi* era, when Wang Mang usurped power, Mei Fu abruptly abandoned his wife and children, departing from Jiujiang. To this day, he is transmitted as an immortal.

Later, there was one who saw Mei Fu in Kuaiji, where he had changed his name and become a gatekeeper in the Wu marketplace.

On the north bank of the great river in Fengcheng County of Hongzhou stands a shrine called the Ascension to Immortality Abbey. During the Shaoxing reign of the Song, he was posthumously enfeoffed as the Perfected Recluse of Shouchun.

The Confucian scholar Ban Si studied alongside his cousin Ban Biao, their family possessing imperial gifts of books. With ample wealth within, scholars fond of antiquity came from afar, and none among his father’s circle—from Yang Xiong downward—failed to visit his gate. Though Ban Si cultivated Confucian learning, he esteemed the guardianship of Laozi and Yanzi. When Huan Tan sought to borrow his books, Ban Si replied:

"As for Master Yan, he cut off sageliness and cast aside cunning, cultivating life and preserving authenticity. Pure and empty, tranquil and indifferent, he returned to spontaneity. Alone, he took heaven and earth as teacher and friend, unenslaved by worldly customs. Fishing in a single ravine, the myriad things did not disturb his resolve. Dwelling in a single hill, the world could not alter his joy. He did not entangle himself in the net of sages nor swallow the bait of arrogant rulers. Unfettered, he gave free rein to his will, and none among those who spoke of him could name him—thus his worthiness.

Now, you are already shackled by the bridle of benevolence and righteousness, bound by the fetters of fame and reputation, treading the tracks of Zhou and Confucius, galloping in the fervent pursuit of Yan and Min. Since you are already constrained by worldly teachings, why employ the Great Dao to dazzle yourself?

Once, there was one who learned to walk in Ye and E, yet before even approximating their manner, he lost his original gait and crawled home. I fear you may resemble this—thus I do not lend."

Such were Ban Si’s conduct and discourse. As "Zhuang" avoided the Han taboo, he was often called Yanzi.

The Daoist guardian Yan Zun, styled Junping, was a native of Shu. His nature was refined and indifferent, his learning profound. He specialized in the *Book of Changes* and was deeply devoted to Laozi and Zhuangzi. He often practiced divination in the Chengdu marketplace, regarding divination as a humble trade yet one that could benefit the masses. When people asked about wickedness or impropriety, he would divine with the tortoise shell and speak accordingly, explaining advantages and harms. To sons, he spoke of filial piety; to younger brothers, of compliance; to ministers, of loyalty. Adapting to circumstances, he guided them toward goodness, and more than half followed his words. Each day, he received only a few visitors, earning enough to sustain himself. Then he would close his stall, lower the curtain, and expound on the *Laozi*. His erudition was boundless. Following the principles of Laozi and Zhuangzi, he composed over one hundred thousand words.

In his youth, Yang Xiong studied under him and gained much of Junping’s Way. There was a wealthy man in Shu named Luo Chong who asked Junping, "Why do you not serve in office?" Junping replied, "I have no means to rouse myself." Chong prepared carriages, horses, clothing, and provisions for him, but Junping said, "I am ill, not lacking in anything. I have abundance while you have want—how can one with want offer to one with abundance?" Chong said, "I possess ten thousand gold, while you have not even a bushel of grain. Is this not an excess on your part?" Junping replied, "Not so. When I lodged at your home before, your servants toiled without rest even after the night had settled, day and night striving without satisfaction. Now, I make my living through divination, and money comes to me without leaving my mat. Yet I still have dust several inches thick, not knowing what to do with it. Is this not my abundance and your want?"

Chong was greatly startled. Junping sighed and said, "Those who increase my wealth harm my spirit. Those who give me fame kill my body." He never entered office. At over ninety years of age, he ended his days in his profession.

The people of Shu revered and cherished him, and his name endures to this day. A shrine stands in Mianzhu County of Hanzhou, and during the Shaoxing reign of the Song, Junping was enfeoffed as the Perfected One of Wondrous Penetration. His original surname was Zhuang; during the Zhanghe era of the Eastern Han, Ban Gu compiled the *Book of Han*. To avoid the personal name of Emperor Ming, the surname was changed to Yan. Zhuang and Yan were also interchangeable terms in ancient and modern usage, hence Lao-Zhuang is also called Lao-Yan.

Master Valley Spirit said: Junping was born in the mid-Western Han. When Wang Mang usurped the throne, he went into reclusion, cautious and harmonious—truly a Perfected One of the highest age. *Record of Mystic Ranks, Scroll the First* ends here.

*Record of Mystic Ranks, Scroll the Second*

**Western Han**
**Daoist Recluse**
Zheng Pu, styled Zizhen, dwelled in reclusion at Valley Mouth. Serene and steadfast in the Dao, he embodied the conduct of utmost virtue. Like Junping, he cultivated himself and preserved his integrity, wearing only what was proper, eating only what was fitting. During the reign of Emperor Cheng, the Grand General Wang Feng extended an invitation to him with full rites, yet he remained unmoved and passed away in seclusion. Yang Xiong’s *Fa Yan* praised him, saying he tilled the land beneath the cliffs, unwavering in his resolve, yet his name resounded throughout the capital. It is said there is a shrine in Hanzhong. Daoist and Confucian alike...

**Yang Xiong**, styled Ziyun, was a native of Chengdu in Shu Commandery. From youth, though poor, he cherished the Dao, reading widely without limit. Silent and fond of profound contemplation, he was pure and detached, free from desires. Neither did he strive for wealth and honor, nor did he lament poverty and lowliness; he did not cultivate integrity to seek fame. By nature, he possessed great magnanimity, and only the books of sages and worthies pleased him. If something did not align with his principles, even wealth and honor would not sway him. He authored works such as the *Tai Xuan* and *Fa Yan*, all delving deeply into the ultimate principles of Heaven and humanity, establishing him as a renowned Confucian of the Han. His learning was rooted in the teachings of the Old Master, as evident in his writings. For instance: *"Only in stillness, only in silence lies the dwelling of virtue. In purity, in tranquility, the spirit roams its court."* In the *Tai Xuan*, he writes: *"Conceal the heart in the abyss, beautify the numinous root."* The commentary states: *"To conceal the heart in the abyss is to prevent the spirit from straying outward."* All these are steps into the chamber of the Old Master.

**Daoist Lineage**
The Three Mao Lords:
- **Eldest Lord**, personal name Ying, styled Shushen.
- **Middle Lord**, personal name Gu, styled Jiwei.
- **Youngest Lord**, personal name Zhong, styled Sihe.

All were natives of Nanguan in Xianyang. The Eldest Lord was born in the fifth year of Emperor Jing’s *Zhongyuan* era (the *bingshen* year), while his two younger brothers were born in the *wuxu* and *gengzi* years, respectively. At eighteen, the Eldest Lord left home and bid farewell to his parents, entering the Heng Mountains to study the *Dao De Jing* and the *Zhou Yi Zhuan*, meditating deeply in pursuit of the Dao. Later, he journeyed to Xicheng, where he encountered the Perfected Sovereign Zong, who entrusted him with the care of sacred texts and diagrams. Thus, he attained the Dao and became a disciple of the Perfected Sovereign. When he returned home, he was forty-nine years old and could revive the dead. His parents marveled at this. He served his parents until their deaths, remaining at home for fifty-three years in total.

The Middle Lord was recommended as *Xiaolian* during Emperor Jing’s reign and as *Xianliang* in the first year of *Yuanshuo*, whereupon he was appointed Gentleman of the Five Offices. In the second year of *Zhenghe*, he was promoted to Grand Tutor to the Crown Prince, and in the first year of *Yuanfeng*, he was appointed Breaking-the-Hu Colonel and Governor of Wuwei.

The Youngest Lord, renowned from youth for his integrity, dwelled in reclusion on Mount Huayin. In the third year of *Jianyuan*, Emperor Wu recommended him as *Fangzheng*, but he declined. He later moved to Liang Kingdom as an honored guest of the Filial King. In the second year of *Dijie*, Emperor Xuan transferred him to serve as Magistrate of Luoyang, then as Colonel of Xicheng and Governor of Shang Commandery. Upon Emperor Yuan’s accession, he was appointed Grand Master of the Five Elders and later Governor of Xihe. At the time, the Middle Lord held the position of Commandant of the Palace Guard, concurrently serving in office. Hundreds from their hometown gathered to see them off.

The Eldest Lord addressed his guests: "Though I have never held the rank of Two Thousand Bushels or served as minister, I shall yet assume a divine office. The Heavenly Thearch has appeared and chosen me to fill the post of Supreme Minister of the Eastern Peak, Lord Huolin Controller of Destinies, overseeing the cultivation of the Dao and governing the registers of life and death in the Wu and Yue regions. This is a vital position among the divine offices of the Supreme Perfected and the ancestral masters."

"On the third day of the fourth month next year, I shall ascend. Will you gentlemen be able to visit me as you do today? If any come to call, there will be no need for expense—provisions shall be provided as a matter of course."

When the appointed day arrived, officials indeed descended to welcome him, and he took leave of his clansmen and the common folk. Turning to the young men of his hometown, he said: "I depart now to dwell temporarily on the mountain of Juqu, where the Jiang River is bound. Though Jiwei Sihe was late in serving me, he will surely repent, resign his office, and abandon his salary to seek me out."

Having spoken, he bid farewell to his contemporaries and departed. This was in the fifth year of *Chuyuan* of Emperor Yuan’s reign, the *dingchou* year, when the Lord was one hundred and two years old.

His two younger brothers, still in office, heard that their elder brother had become a transcendent in broad daylight. They each resigned their posts and returned home. In the fifth year of *Yongguang*, the *renwu* year, on the sixth day of the third month, they crossed the Jiang River to seek their brother on Mount Ju. When they met, they wept bitterly at his words. The Lord said to his brothers: "How late your awakening has come!"

He then transmitted to them divine elixirs and efficacious methods for salvation, and together they attained the rank of Perfected. They administered the grotto-heavens of Mount Juqu, the Golden Altar, and the Heaven of Huayang. Thus, the Middle Lord was titled Lord of Fixed Registers, and the Youngest Lord was titled Lord of Life-Preserving Transcendence—both celestial offices.

In the second year of *Yuan Shou* of Emperor Ai’s reign, the *gengshen* year, when the Eldest Lord was one hundred and forty-five, on the eighteenth day of the eighth month, the *jiyou* day, he received the Nine Bestowments and the jade writ of investiture. He was promoted to the office of the Jade Grotto of Red City, assuming the rank of Supreme Perfected Controller of Destinies, Supreme Minister of the Eastern Peak, and Grand Primordial Perfected.

The Lord said to his brothers: "Now that I depart for my new post, I shall not be able to visit often. However, I shall return to this mountain twice a year—on the eighteenth day of the third month and the second day of the twelfth month. On those dates, my master, the Lord of Total Perfection, and the Red Perfected of the Southern Prison of Grand Emptiness will also visit your abode. Those who cherish the Dao may await me on these days, and I shall attend to them, instructing the unawakened as needed."

Thereupon, the two brothers remained to govern Mount Mao. Within the grotto, they established offices and structures, while abroad they propagated the Dao to all things, nourishing the myriad beings and bestowing virtue upon birds and beasts, each attaining its true nature. Their divine efficacy manifested in fortune and misfortune, and the wicked were surely exposed. With inner teachings harmonized and outer doctrines made plain, the winds and rains came in due season, the five grains ripened, illnesses did not arise, and violent harms were averted. The land knew no calamity, and the towns no banditry.

The elders of the time sang in praise:
*Mount Mao joins Jinling,*
*The Jiang and lakes lie below.*
*Three divinities ride white cranes,*
*Each governing a mountain peak.*
*They summon rain to irrigate parched rice,*
*And even dry fields grow supple.*
*Wives and children dwell secure,*
*Leaving me free of all cares.*
*White cranes soar in the azure sky—*
*When will they return to roam?*

When the Three Lords departed, each rode a white crane to alight upon one of the three peaks of the mountain. Many witnessed this, inspiring the song. Thereafter, the places where the cranes had landed were designated as the three mountains of the Eldest, Middle, and Youngest Lords of Mao. Collectively, they remained known as Mount Juqu, bearing no other name.

Zhang Ling, whose Daoist name was Daoling and courtesy name Fuhan, hailed from Feng County in Pei State. He was born on Mount Tianmu in Yuhang. Formerly a student of the Imperial Academy, he mastered the Five Classics but later lamented, "These bring no benefit to one’s years or destiny." He then studied the *Yellow Emperor’s Nine-Cauldron Scripture of Elixirs*, achieving alchemical success on Mount Fanyang. He also obtained esoteric texts from a stone chamber on Mount Song.

Amidst the turmoil of the age, as the Han Dynasty declined and the literary Dao withered, he deemed it insufficient to rescue the world from peril. Retreating to Yuhang, he remained in seclusion for a decade. Later, he entered Shu with his disciples, where the people reverently accepted him as their master. He governed with integrity, shame, and compassion, eschewing harsh punishments. Those afflicted by illness were instructed to confess their lifelong transgressions and pledge to the spirits, vowing death as the penalty for falsehood. Thus, they abandoned evil and embraced virtue. He opened brine springs for the people’s benefit, expelled a great serpent, and vanquished ghosts in twenty-four battles, establishing twenty-four parishes to rid Shu of its plagues. His meticulous cultivation of life-preserving arts, his command over mountain and peak spirits, and his manifest virtue and merit earned him the title "Heavenly Master." Among his disciples, Wang Chang and Zhao Sheng attained his Dao most fully.

Dao Yin, whose courtesy name was Ziping, was a native of Chaoge in Henei. He lived in reclusion at home, valuing harmony above all. Fond of the *Dao De Jing* and the *Book of Changes*, he once sighed upon reading the hexagrams of *Decrease* and *Increase*: "I now understand that wealth is not superior to poverty, nor nobility to lowliness—but I still wonder whether death is better than life." Though poor and lacking resources, those who admired his virtue supported him. He accepted only what he needed, returning the rest.

In the Jianwu era, after his children’s marriages were settled, he severed all ties with household affairs and roamed freely among the Five Peaks and famous mountains, ultimately vanishing without a trace.

**Dao Transformation**
Feng Meng, courtesy name Ziqing, was a native of Duchang in Beihai. Upon hearing that Wang Mang had executed his son Yu, he said to a friend: "The Three Bonds are broken. If I do not leave, disaster will befall others." He then removed his official cap and hung it on the eastern gate of the capital, took his family, and sailed across the sea to settle in Liaodong. Meng, well-versed in yin-yang theory, knew Wang Mang’s downfall was imminent. He placed a clay pot on his head and wailed in the marketplace: "The New! The New!" Thereafter, he went into hiding. When Emperor Guangwu ascended the throne, Meng traveled to Laoshan in Langye to cultivate his will and practice the Dao. The people were transformed by his virtue, and though repeatedly summoned to office, he refused, living out his years in peace.

**Dao Reclusion**
Yan Guang, courtesy name Ziling, was a native of Yuyao in Kuaiji. From youth, he was renowned for his lofty character and studied alongside Emperor Guangwu. When Guangwu ascended the throne, Yan changed his name and concealed himself. The emperor, missing his worth, ordered searches using descriptions and gifts. Later, the state of Qi reported a man clad in a sheepskin robe fishing in the marshes. Suspecting it was Yan, the emperor sent envoys with a carriage draped in black and fragrant herbs to invite him. After three summons, Yan finally arrived and lodged in the guest quarters, though he did not rise to greet the emperor. The emperor approached his bedside and patted Yan’s belly, saying: "Alas, Ziling! Can you truly not assist me in governance?" Yan remained lying down, unresponsive, until after a long while he opened his eyes and gazed intently, saying: "In ancient times, the sage-kings Yao and Shun were famed for their virtue, yet Chao Fu washed his ears. A scholar has his own aspirations—why press me so?" The emperor replied: "Can I not even humble myself before you?" He then boarded his carriage, sighed deeply, and departed. Later, Yan was summoned again, and they discussed the Dao and old times, staying together for days. The emperor casually asked: "How do I compare to my former self?" Yan answered: "Your Majesty has improved somewhat." That night, they lay side by side, and Yan placed his feet on the emperor’s belly. The next day, the imperial astronomer reported that a guest star had dangerously encroached upon the emperor’s celestial seat. The emperor laughed: "It was only my old friend Yan Ziling sharing my bed." In a letter replying to the Minister of Works, Hou Ba, Yan wrote: "Embracing benevolence and aiding righteousness delights the world; flattering and fawning severs the vital neck." Appointed as Remonstrance Grandee, he refused to yield and instead farmed on Fuchun Mountain. Later generations named his fishing spot Yanling Rapids. In the seventeenth year of the Jianwu era, he was again specially summoned but did not go. He died at home at the age of eighty, and the emperor mourned his passing.

Liang Hong, styled Boluan, was a native of Pingling in Fufeng. Though his family was poor, he herded swine in the Shanglin Park. Once, he accidentally set a fire that spread to neighboring dwellings. Liang compensated the owners with all his swine, but they deemed it insufficient. He then offered to work off the debt himself. Later, returning to his hometown, powerful families admired his lofty integrity and many sought to marry their daughters to him, but Liang declined them all.

In the same commandery lived a woman of the Meng clan—stout, dark, and homely, strong enough to lift a stone mortar. She had refused all suitors and remained unmarried until the age of thirty. When her parents asked why, she replied, "I wish to marry a man as worthy as Liang Boluan." Upon hearing this, Liang sent a betrothal gift. The woman requested coarse cloth, hemp sandals, and tools for weaving and spinning. Only when she was wed did she adorn herself. For seven days after entering his home, Liang did not speak to her. His wife then knelt beneath the bed and said, "I have heard of your noble principles and know you have rejected many women, just as I have spurned many men. Now that you have chosen me, I dare not but ask for your forgiveness."

Liang replied, "I seek one who wears rough cloth and can dwell with me in the deep mountains. You, dressed in fine silks and adorned with powder and ink, are not what I desire." His wife answered, "I only wished to see your resolve. I have my own garments for reclusion." She then bound her hair in a simple knot, donned plain cloth, and stepped forward with downcast eyes. Liang rejoiced, saying, "This is truly the wife of Liang Hong—she can serve me well." He named her Deyao.

Together they entered the mountains of Baoling, living by farming and weaving, reciting poetry, studying books, and playing the zither for their own delight. Admiring the lofty scholars of antiquity, they composed eulogies for the Four Hoary Ones, later adding twenty-four more. Passing through the eastern pass, they traveled through the capital, where Liang composed the *Five Sighs*:

*"Steep is that northern waste—ah!
I long to see the imperial city—ah!
Towering rise its palaces—ah!
How the people toil—ah!
Endless, endless the days—ah!"*

Emperor Ming heard the song and disapproved, ordering Liang’s arrest, but he could not be found. Liang then changed his name to Yunqi, styled Houguang, and lived with his wife and children in the region between Qi and Lu. Later, they moved to the household of Gao Botong, a great landowner in Wu, where Liang worked as a hired laborer in Yingxia. Each time he returned home, his wife prepared his meal but dared not lift her gaze before him, raising the tray to her brows in reverence.

When Botong observed this, he found it extraordinary and said, "That a hired laborer can command such reverence from his wife must mean he is no ordinary man." He then properly housed Liang in his home. When Liang fell gravely ill, he told his master, "Take care that my son does not return home to hold mourning rites." Upon Liang’s death, Botong and others sought a burial site beside Wu’s tomb of Yaoli, all agreeing, "Yaoli was a martyr of resolve, and Boluan a man of pure loftiness—they should lie near one another."

Liang’s friend was Gao Hui.
Daoist Recluse Gao Hui, styled Botong, was a native of Jingzhao. Fond of the *Laozi*, he lived in seclusion on Huayin Mountain and shared a close friendship with Liang Hong. When Liang journeyed east, Hui, missing him, composed a poem:

*"O the cawing crows—ah, my friend!
I long for Master Gao—ah, my heart aches,
Thoughts of Hui gather—ah, they alight."*

The two never met again. Hui, too, maintained his noble aloofness, refusing office for life.

Daoist Virtuosi
Wei Boyang, a man of Wu, was born to a distinguished family but favored Daoist arts over official service. He lived in quietude to cultivate his nature, and none knew his origins, assuming he merely tended to governance and self-cultivation. He entered the mountains to concoct the divine elixir, and upon consuming it, died and revived. With his disciple surnamed Yu, he ascended as an immortal. Encountering woodcutters on the road, he left a handwritten letter bidding farewell to his hometown and two disciples.

Boyang authored the *Cantong Qi*, three scrolls on the mutual resonance of the Five Phases. Its discourse resembles the *Zhouyi*, though it borrows hexagrams to expound the great elixir’s principles. Yet many scholars, unversed in alchemy, misinterpret it through yin-yang theories, straying far from its intent. According to the *Cantong Qi*, eminent Confucians like Zhu Yuanhui and Cai Yuanding deeply valued its meaning, often engaging with its ideas—only those profoundly versed in the *Yi* and *Laozi* could fathom its depths.

Daoist Adept
Tai Dang, styled Xiaowei, was a native of Ye in Wei Commandery.

Daoist Adept Tai Dang retreated into the mountains of Wu’an, where he carved out a cave for his dwelling and gathered herbs to sustain himself. When the provincial governor toured his jurisdiction or dispatched officials on legal matters to pay their respects, Dang, feigning illness, went to decline the visit. The governor, taking the initiative to meet him, said: "Xiaowei, living in such conditions—how bitter it must be." Dang replied: "I am fortunate to preserve my nature and life, to nurture my spirit and harmonize my qi. Yet Your Excellency, in carrying out imperial decrees and attending to myriad affairs, does not find it bitter?" He then departed and remained in reclusion, never to be seen again.

Daoist Recluse Han Kang, styled Boren and also known as Tianxiu, was a native of Baoling in the capital district of Jingzhao, hailing from a distinguished family. He often gathered herbs in famous mountains and sold them in the markets of Chang’an. For over thirty years, he never altered his prices. Once, a woman purchased medicine from Kang, who steadfastly held to his price. The woman grew angry: "Are you not Han Boren? Why then do you not change your price?" Kang sighed: "I sought only to avoid fame, yet even a young woman knows of me—what use is selling herbs?" He then fled into the mountains of Baling.

Daoist Hermit Jiao Shen, styled Zhongyan, was a native of Maoling in Fufeng. From youth, he favored the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, dwelling in seclusion among mountains and valleys. He hollowed out a cave for his chamber, emulating the breathwork and longevity practices of Master Red Pine and Wangzi Qiao. His fellow townsmen, Ma Rong and Su Zhang, though esteemed in their time, all deferred to Shen’s precedence. Wu Cang of Runan held him in great esteem and sent a letter to gauge his aspirations, writing: "Zhongyan, though your diligent reclusion and modest living may seem as distant as clouds and mud, or lodging in towers versus caves, whenever the western wind blows, how can I not sigh? I have heard that the words of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, riding the void to enter the obscure, conceal the self in distant realms—yet they also offer principles for governing the state and nurturing the people. Applied to governance, their way is supreme. As for ascending mountains and erasing one’s traces, though the spirit leaves no proof, people witness its effects. I seek from you what may be feasible—what are your thoughts? In ancient times, Yi Yin did not withhold the Dao while awaiting a Yao or Shun. Now, with the realm radiant and enlightened, the paths of Chao Fu and Xu You lie open. Do not, like Boyi and Shuqi, regret entering Shouyang, nor like Jishan’s recluses. If you can ride dragons and play with phoenixes, soaring among the clouds, this is not something foxes, rabbits, swallows, or sparrows dare contemplate." Shen did not reply. At over seventy years of age, he remained unwed. Later, he suddenly returned home, declaring the day of his death. When the appointed time came, he indeed passed away.

Later generations encountered Shen in Dunhuang, and thus the ancients marveled at him.

Dao Yin, styled Gaoqing, was a native of Fufeng in Na. He pursued learning without fixed methods, and his family transmitted both inner and outer illustrated classics, making him a disciple of the great Confucian scholars of Guanzhong. Hundreds came from distant lands to study under him. By nature serene and desireless, he avoided social entanglements. When the prefect summoned him, he arrived wearing only a cloth headwrap to pay his respects. The prefect sought to appoint him as a functionary, but Yin replied: "Your Excellency treats me with courtesy, so I dare to consider myself a humble guest. If you wish to make me an official, I shall retreat to the south of the southern mountains or the north of the northern mountains." His fellow townsman Tian Ruo recommended Yin, praising his mastery of the Four Arts and his reclusive, tranquil life. He was poised to follow the lofty footsteps of Laozi, refusing to bend even for the allure of mystical prestige. Ruo petitioned the sagely court to bestow upon him a nominal post, certain that he could offer the pure hymns of the ancestral temple and summon the phoenix of auspicious omen. The emperor, with sincere intent, issued four summons, but Yin declared: "Since I cannot flee the world in form, how could I drink the waters of those who washed their ears?" He then concealed himself deeply, severing all ties.

His friend Guo Zheng praised him, saying: "The name of Fa Zhen may be heard, but his person is difficult to meet. Fleeing fame, fame follows me; evading fame, fame pursues me. He may truly be called a teacher for a hundred generations." Together, they carved a stele in his honor, styling him Master of Mystic Virtue.

Dao Hua, styled Wenrao, was a native of Hongnong. At seventy-three, he one day encountered the Master of Green Valley, who descended into his bedchamber and bestowed upon him the method of the Staff and the Art of Release. He was instructed to enter Mount Hua, practice the Nine Breaths, and consume the Black Elixir. The master also transmitted to him the furnace and fire alchemical formula, and through cultivation, he attained the Dao. Later, he dwelled in the Huayang Grotto, guiding those who first sought the Way.

Hua served the Han as Minister of Works and Grand Commandant, delighting in secret virtue and aiding the cold and destitute. The people rejoiced in him and clung to him as to their parents. Dao concealed...

Pang Gong, a native of Xiangyang in Nanjun, dwelled south of Mount Xian. He never entered the city or government offices, and he and his wife treated each other with the reverence of guests. Liu Biao, the Inspector of Jingzhou, repeatedly extended invitations but could not persuade him, so he went to visit him and said: "To preserve one's own body—how does this compare to preserving all under heaven?" Pang Gong laughed and replied: "The swan and the crane nest in the high forests, and at dusk find their roost. The turtle and the snake burrow in the deep abyss, and at evening find their shelter. The choices one makes in action or stillness are but the nests and burrows of men—each finds their own place to perch or lodge, and that is all." Thereupon, he set aside his plow on the ridge, while his wife and children weeded before him. Liu Biao pointed and asked: "Master, you toil in the fields and refuse official rank—what will you leave to your descendants?" Pang Gong said: "Others leave their heirs peril; I alone leave them peace. Though what we leave differs, it is not as if I leave them nothing." He then took his wife and children and ascended Deer Gate Mountain, where he gathered herbs and never returned.

Daoist-Confucian
Liao Fu, styled Wenqi, was a native of Pingyu in Runan.

Liao Fu studied the *Han Odes* and the *Ouyang Shangshu*, teaching hundreds of disciples at times. His father was imprisoned and died for an offense, and Fu, grieving that his father had perished by the law, shrank from becoming an official. When the mourning period ended, he sighed and said: "Laozi said, 'Name and self—which is dearer?' How could I pursue a name?" Thereupon, he severed all worldly ambitions, devoting himself wholly to the classics. He was especially versed in celestial reckoning and the arts of astral divination. Though summoned by prefectures, commanderies, and high offices, he declined all. Foreseeing years of famine, he amassed thousands of *hu* of grain and distributed them entirely to his clan and in-laws. He also gathered and buried those who had died in epidemics and could not be interred by their own families. The people of his time called him "Master of the Northern Wilds." He died at home at the age of eighty.

Daoist Teachings
Fan Ying, styled Jiqi, was a native of Luyang in Nanyang. In his youth, he studied in the Three Adjuncts, mastering the *Jing School’s Book of Changes* and the Five Classics. He was also skilled in divination by wind and angles, calculations of the *He* and *Luo* texts, the Seven Apocrypha, and the prediction of disasters and anomalies. He secluded himself on the southern slope of Mount Hu, and though the state and commanderies repeatedly extended invitations with courtesy, he refused. When nominated as *Xianliang*, *Fangzheng*, or *Youdao*, he likewise declined.

In the second year of *Yongjian* (127 CE), Emperor Shun issued an imperial summons with full ceremonial reverence to invite him, but Fan Ying again firmly declined on grounds of grave illness. The emperor then ordered local authorities to compel his journey by carriage. When Fan Ying arrived in the capital, he claimed illness and refused to rise. They forcibly carried him into the palace hall, yet he still would not yield to protocol.

The emperor, enraged, declared: "I can give you life or take it, exalt you or humble you, enrich you or impoverish you. How dare you defy my command?"

Fan Ying replied: "I receive my fate from Heaven—whether I live out my allotted span or die before my time, it is all decreed by Heaven. How can Your Majesty grant me life or take it? I regard a tyrannical ruler as I would a sworn enemy; even standing in his court, I would refuse. How then could I be exalted? Though I dwell among commoners within four bare walls, I remain at perfect ease, unmoved by the majesty of ten thousand chariots. How could I be humbled? How can Your Majesty exalt or humble me?

Ill-gotten emoluments, though vast as ten thousand bushels, I would not accept. Yet when I affirm my resolve, even a single bowl of rice or gourd of water brings no discontent. How can Your Majesty enrich or impoverish me?"

The emperor, unable to bend him, came to respect his reputation. He was sent to the Imperial Physicians’ quarters to recuperate. The emperor ordered the *Gongche* commandant and the *Shangshu* to escort him with honor, presenting him with a ceremonial desk and staff, treating him with the deference due a teacher and mentor. Whenever the court encountered omens or anomalies, the emperor would issue edicts seeking his counsel, and his responses often proved accurate.

He died at home at the age of over seventy. *Daoist Virtues*

Wang Yuan, styled Fangping, was a native of Donghai. He was nominated as a *Filial and Incorrupt* candidate and appointed Gentleman Cadet, gradually rising to the rank of *Zhongsan* Grandee. Well-versed in the Five Classics, he was especially proficient in the arts of celestial patterns, apocryphal texts, and the *He* and *Luo* diagrams, foretelling the rise and fall of the realm and discerning the fortunes and misfortunes of the Nine Provinces as if they lay in his palm.

Later, he resigned his post and entered the mountains to cultivate the Dao. Upon achieving mastery, Emperor Huan of the Han repeatedly summoned him, but he refused to emerge. The prefectural governor was ordered to compel him into a carriage and bring him to the capital. Yuan lowered his head and sealed his lips, declining to respond. The emperor then inscribed over four hundred characters on the palace gate panels, all foretelling future events. Displeased, the emperor had the words scraped away, but though the outer layer was removed, the inner characters reappeared, the ink having penetrated the wood. Fangping left no descendants, but his neighbors and descendants of his lineage transmitted his teachings and served him for generations.

A former Grand Commandant of the same commandery, Chen Dan, built a Daoist chamber for Fangping. Morning and evening, Dan paid homage to him, seeking only blessings and disaster aversion, not instruction in the Dao. Fangping resided in Dan’s home for over forty years. Later, he told Dan: “My destined term is nearing its end; I must depart and cannot remain. Tomorrow at noon, I shall leave.” When the hour arrived, Fangping died. Knowing he had transformed and departed, Dan dared not lower the body to the ground. Weeping and sighing, he cried: “Master, you abandon me—what shall become of me?” He prepared a coffin and incense, dressing the body on the bed. After three days and nights, the corpse vanished, the garments and sash undisturbed, as if a cicada had shed its husk.

Over a hundred days after Fangping’s departure, Dan also died. Some said Dan had attained Fangping’s Dao and transformed away; others claimed Fangping, foreseeing Dan’s end, had entrusted him and departed.

Later, Fangping intended to journey to Mount Kuocang. Passing through Wu, he stayed at the home of Cai Jing in Xumen. Jing was a commoner whose bones were suited for transcendence. Fangping visited his home and told him: “Your fate decrees deliverance in this life, yet you have heard little of the Dao in your youth. Now your *qi* is scant while your flesh is abundant—you must undergo *corpse liberation*. Though the process is arduous, it will be swift as passing through a dog’s burrow.” He imparted essential instructions and then left Jing. Later, Jing indeed shed his mortal form like a cicada, vanishing without a trace.

A decade and more later, he suddenly returned home and told his family: “On the seventh day of the seventh month, Lord Wang shall pass by. On that day, prepare several hundred *hu* of food and drink to offer his retinue.” Then he departed. When the appointed day arrived, Fangping indeed came. Waving his banner and leading his procession, he bore the majestic presence of a great general. He summoned Ma Gu to meet at Jing’s home. A neighbor, Officer Chen, kowtowed and begged to be taken into service, wishing to be ranked alongside Cai Jing. Fangping said: “Rise for now and stand facing the sun.” From behind, Fangping observed him and said: “Alas! Your heart is not upright, and your shadow is crooked—you can never be taught the Dao of immortality. I shall appoint you as an earthly overseer instead.” As he prepared to leave, he placed one talisman and one transmission in a small box, giving it to Officer Chen with the words: “This can dispel misfortune and subdue ghosts.” Later, Officer Chen lived to one hundred and ten, and though he once received a written gift from Fangping—its characters bold and sprawling, large but unrefined—none had known Fangping’s name before; only later did distant regions learn of him through Officer Chen’s account.

The Dao-transformed Han Chong, styled Changji, was a native of Piling in Wu Commandery.

In his youth, Han Chong cherished the Dao. The immortal Wang Wei of Linwu Mountain once transmitted to him the method of the Flowing Pearl Elixir. Chong practiced it diligently, and it proved highly efficacious. Zhang Xuan later told him: “By following this Way, you may also enter officialdom without hindering your immortal aspirations.” Chong thus took office, gradually rising to become Magistrate of Wanling. He governed with benevolence and administered with the Dao, so that tigers and wolves kept their distance, and locusts never alighted within his borders. Later promoted to Governor of Runan, he elevated the clerk Yuan An. Eventually, he rose to the rank of Minister over the Masses, and his contemporaries universally acknowledged his discernment in recognizing worth.

When Empress Yin was interred near the capital, the wives of the commandery governors and prefects within two thousand *li* were to gather at the imperial mausoleum. Chong alone remained in austere simplicity. His wife, resentful, wept before him. When Emperor Ming inquired as to the reason, Minister of Ceremonies Feng Yi replied: “The Governor of Runan, Han Chong, embraces purity and reveres the distant, savoring the Dao and forgetting the body. Though he holds high office, his wife still spins thread herself. His governance is virtuous, and he regards the people as though they were wounded.”

Han Chong’s insight was profound and expansive, possessing the discernment of a true gentleman. He was as a radiant light in the darkest night, a Zichan to Your Majesty. His wife, unaccustomed to frugality and hardship, wept in resentment over the lack of clothing—yet this only served to illuminate Chong’s illustrious virtue. The Emperor marveled at this and increased Chong’s salary, raising his rank to that of a full two-thousand-*shi* official.

Later, when Emperor Ming toured Runan, he visited Chong’s residence. Chong sent his wife away to stay with a solitary elderly woman. Upon hearing this, the Emperor sighed and said, “Han Chong is truly one who remains untainted despite a hundred refinings.” He bestowed upon him fifty bolts of fine silk.

Chong governed the commandery for fourteen years, his transformative governance so renowned that it was deemed the finest in the realm. At the age of seventy-four, Zhang Xuan initiated him into the method of *Yin Jie* (Hidden Release), allowing him to depart and enter Great Huo Mountain. There, he was further instructed in the *Dun Hua Ni Wan Zi Hu Wei* (Transcendent Transformation of the Mud-Pill Purple Gate Guard) to attain deliverance into immortality. Later, he served in the Hua Yang Grotto as the Left Supervisor of the Central Registry.

Tao Hongjing notes: “The events recorded in the *Book of Han* are largely the same, though the phrasing differs slightly.”

**Daoist Guardians**

Xia Fu, styled Zizhi, was a native of Chenliu. From youth, he was devoted to the Dao, consuming pine resin and refined mica. Later, he entered Mount Wu, where he received the *Lian Hun Fa* (Method of Refining the Soul) from the Red-Bearded Master. In the Hua Yang Grotto, he served as the Dawn Attendant.

In his early years, Fu was summoned by the imperial court, yet he hung the summons on a mulberry tree and departed—such was his lofty and unyielding spirit. Tao Hongjing records in the *Later Han* and *Biographies of Eminent Recluses* that Fu was from Yu in Chenliu and was recommended during Emperor Huan’s reign but refused to accept office.

**Daoist Transformations**

Liu Lan, styled Zixiang (in the *Book of Han*, his style is recorded as Zixiang), was originally from Yingchuan. From youth, he was drawn to the Dao and virtue. Though his family was immensely wealthy, he frequently aided others without considering it a favor, having saved and succored the poor and deceased more times than could be counted.

He was recommended as an *Exemplary Filial and Incorrupt* candidate and appointed Gentleman, later rising to Governor of Chenliu. Within five hundred *li* of Chang’an, he gathered the dead, relieved the destitute, and diminished his own wealth to share with others. While traveling through Yangping, he encountered the Horse Emperor Master, who said to him: “Your benevolence has moved Heaven and Earth, your hidden virtue has stirred gods and spirits. The Supreme Lord commends your sincerity and has sent me to bestow upon you the Way of Longevity.”

Lan kowtowed and struck his breast, begging to serve as an attendant. The master then led him into Mount Tongbai, where he was initiated into the *Yin Di Ba Wei* (Eight Hidden Earth Guards) and the method of consuming the essence of the Five Stars. He attained deliverance under the name *Eastern Radiance* and entered the Hua Yang Grotto as the Right Supervisor of the Central Registry of the Fixed Record Bureau.

**Three Kingdoms Daoist Scholars**

Zhang Ji, styled Ziming, wandered in his youth through the Imperial Academy, mastering both inner and outer learning. The Governor of Bingzhou, Gao Gan, memorialized to appoint him as Magistrate of Leping, but he declined. He then withdrew to Mount Chang, where his disciples numbered several hundred. When the Grand Ancestor served as Chancellor, he summoned Zhang, who did not attend. During the Taihe era, an imperial edict sought scholars of reclusive learning, and the commandery repeatedly recommended him, but he pleaded old age and infirmity to avoid going. When Lu Yu, the Prefect of Guangping, arrived at his post, his aides reported that previous officials had sent wooden tablets to pay respects to Zhang. Lu instructed: "Master Zhang is one of those who ‘serves not the Son of Heaven above, nor befriends the feudal lords below.’ How could mere tablets and visits do justice to his virtue? Dispatch only a clerk with a letter and gifts of lamb and wine."

Zhang passed away at the age of one hundred and five. That year, when Prefect Wang Su took office, he issued an order to the counties: "While still in the capital, I heard of Zhang Ziming. Upon arriving here, I inquired after him, only to learn of his passing—deeply grievous. This gentleman was steadfast in learning, dwelling in reclusion, and competing not with the times, finding joy in the Dao to nurture his person. In ancient days, the elder of Jiang County, though mired in obscurity, was raised by Zhao Meng, and the feudal lords lived in harmony. Pitying his aged devotion to the Dao, unadorned by honor or favor, upon receipt of this document, dispatch an officer to console his family. Mark his gate prominently and accord him exceptional distinction, to comfort the departed and encourage those to come."

**Daoist Recluses**

Jiao Xian, styled Xiaoran, was a native of Hedong. During the late Han, when chaos engulfed Guanzhong, he lost his family and fled alone to the islets of the Yellow River. He ate grasses and drank water, wearing neither clothes nor shoes. Once, Zhu Nanwang of Taiyang Commandery saw him from afar and mistook him for a fugitive, intending to send a boat to capture him. A fellow townsman, Hou Wuyang, told the county: "This is but a mad fool." Thus, his name was registered, and he was given five *sheng* of congee daily, though people mocked and slighted him. Yet he never trod crooked paths, walking only along field boundaries. When gleaning, he took no overlarge ears of grain. Hungry, he ate not indiscriminately; cold, he clothed not carelessly. Whenever he went out and saw women, he concealed himself, emerging only after they had passed. He built a hut of gourd vines, sweeping it clean within. He fashioned a bed of wood, covering it with straw. In bitter cold, he kindled a fire to warm himself, muttering to himself. During the Taihe and Qinglong eras, he once carried a staff to the southern bank of the river. When the waters swelled, he would say alone, "Not yet time." Thus, people suspected he was not truly mad, for his words often proved true, and they came to call him a recluse. He died at eighty-nine.

**Daoist Recluses**

Shi Delin, a native of Anding, fled south to Hanzhong in the sixteenth year of Jian’an, when chaos gripped Guanzhong. From the outset, he cultivated no property nor took a wife or disciples.

He constantly recited the *Five Thousand Characters* of Laozi and various inner texts, chanting them day and night without cease. When his food was insufficient, he often begged, yet never accepted what was not freely given. If asked his name, he would not speak. The people of his time called him "Cold and Poor," for he was wholly devoted to the profound and the silent.

**Daoist Adepts**

Zuǒ Cí, styled Yuánfàng, was a native of Lujiang. In his youth, he mastered the Five Classics and was also versed in astrology. Seeing the Han dynasty’s mandate nearing its end and the realm descending into chaos, he sighed, saying: "In such a time of decline, high office invites peril, and great wealth courts death. The fleeting glory of this world is not worth coveting." He then turned to the Dao, refining his thoughts in the depths of Mount Tianzhu, where he obtained a cinnabar scripture from a stone chamber. Through its practice, he gained the power to transform himself in myriad ways. When Lord Cao summoned him for testing and sought to study the Dao under him, Cí replied: "The study of the Dao demands purity, integrity, and non-action—it is not fitting for the exalted." Cao, ever suspicious and jealous, repeatedly sought to kill him, but could not. When Cí was in Jingzhou under Liu Biao’s governorship, Biao, deeming him a corrupter of the masses, again plotted to kill him. Cí, foreseeing this, left Biao’s service and departed. Later, he met Sun Quan, the Lord of Wu, who had long known of Cí’s mastery of the Dao and treated him with great reverence.

According to the *True Records*, Cí now dwells on Mount Xiaokuo, often traveling to and fro, and has repeatedly descended here to receive new appointments. His complexion remained youthful, having benefited from the Nine-Flowered Elixir of the furnace fire. He concealed himself in the Kuocang Mountains. In the final years of Jian’an, Cí once crossed the Yangtze to seek Mount Mao, where he entered its grottoes. He also begged for cinnabar to compound the Nine-Flowered Elixir, becoming the master of Ge Xuan, who was a disciple of Li Zhongfu.

**Daoist Adepts**

Ge Xuán, styled Xiàoxiān...

Having received scriptures and methods from Zuǒ Yuánfàng, he once consumed wood and was especially skilled in treating illnesses and exorcising malevolent spirits, capable of dividing his form and transforming his appearance. The Emperor of Wu urgently sought an audience, desiring to bestow honor and rank upon him. Xuán declined and sought to depart, but was detained and treated with the courtesy due a guest. One day, he told his disciple Zhāng Gōng: "I am constrained by the world’s ruler and cannot find leisure to refine the great elixir. Today, on the thirteenth day of the eighth month at noon, I shall depart." When the appointed time arrived, Xuán, clad in his robes and cap, entered his chamber. Outside, his breath ceased, yet his complexion remained unchanged. His disciples burned incense and kept vigil for three days. On the third night at midnight, a sudden great wind arose, tearing at the roof and snapping trees with a sound like thunder; the candles were extinguished. After a long while, when the candles were relit, he was nowhere to be found—only his discarded robes lay upon the bed, the sash still tied. The next morning, when they asked the neighbors, the neighbors said: "There was no great wind." The wind had been confined to a single dwelling, where fences and trees were all broken and felled.

According to the *True Records*, Xuán first dwelled on Mount Cháng, then later entered Gài Zhú. He could ride tigers and command ghosts, reaching wherever he willed, though he had nearly yet to receive formal appointment. The *Hidden Dwelling Notes* states: He was the cousin of Bào Pǔ and the master of Zhèng Sīyuǎn. In his youth, he entered the mountains and attained transcendence; none could fathom his whereabouts. It is said that immortals from the Eastern Sea once sent him a letter, addressing him as "Immortal Lord." Thus, Bào Pǔ likewise honored him as such.

**Daoist Adepts**

Bào Yuè, styled Tàixuán, was a native of Chénliú in the Eastern Sea. At the age of five, he told his parents: "I was originally a child of the Lǐ family in Qūyáng. At nine, I fell into a well and died." His parents investigated and found the Lǐ family; upon inquiry, all details were confirmed. Yuè’s learning encompassed both inner and outer arts, and he was well-versed in celestial patterns and the *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture*. He served as Grand Administrator of Nányáng and once, while inspecting his jurisdiction, entered the sea. Caught in a storm and suffering from hunger, he took white stones, boiled them, and ate them to sustain himself. Later, he met the Perfected One, Yīn Jūn, who transmitted Daoist secrets to him. He also studied the Central Scripture methods from Zuǒ Yuánfàng and received the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*. He could command ghosts and spirits, seal mountains, and subdue demons. He lived over a hundred years before passing away.

As recorded in the *True Reports*, both Yuè and his younger sister were blessed by the accumulated hidden virtues of seven generations of ancestors, thus extending their fortune to Yuè and the others. Today, they all serve as rulers in the underworld, dwelling in Huáyáng. Yǐnjū states: Yuè employed the Tàiqīng method of *shījiě* (corpse liberation), and thus must rank among the highest of these rulers.

Yuè’s daughter, Bào Gū, was the wife of Gě Hóng, Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary. The Daoist tradition speaks of Zhāng Xuánbīn, a native of Dìngxiāng. During the reign of Emperor Wǔ of Wèi, he was recommended as a *màocái* (esteemed talent) and returned to his hometown to study under Sū of Xīhé. He practiced the ingestion of wood and herbs while also engaging in the affairs of the *Dòngfáng* and *Bái Yuán*. Later, he encountered the Perfected One, Fán Zǐmíng, who on Shàoshì Mountain transmitted to him the Dao of *dùnbiàn* (transformation and concealment) and *yǐnjǐng* (hidden radiance).

Formerly residing on Tiānzhù Mountain, he later entered the inner realm of Huáyáng to serve as the *Lǐjìn Bó* (Earl of Governance and Prohibition). The *Lǐjìn Bó* oversees the office of rain and water and also serves as the *Jiànguó* (Overseer of Life Preservation). Xuánbīn excelled in discoursing on emptiness and non-being, often asserting in debates that non-being is the dwelling of the great *yǒu* (being/existence), while the small *yǒu* is that from which the small *wú* (non-being) arises. One accumulates the small *yǒu* to nurture the small *wú*, and perceives the great *yǒu* to grasp the root of the great *wú*. Being exists within non-being, just as non-being exists within being. Thus, my eyes see no objects, nor do objects see non-being. One lodges in being to perfect non-being, and lodges in non-being to attain non-being. Thereupon, non-being has no dwelling, and the great void itself becomes the abode of non-being.

He once declared: "Before my birth, the world was entirely without non-being. Formerly, I visited Sòng Chénshēng, the Left Duke of Pénglái, and discussed non-being with him, barely satisfying his expectations. Even the various Perfected Ones of Tóngbó could not refute me. Beyond this, if one cannot grasp the root of being, how can one grasp the root of non-being?" Such was the loftiness of his spirit and the principle he upheld. [End of Daoist and Confucian accounts.]

Wang Bi, styled Fusi, was a native of Gaoping in Shanyang. From youth, he was perceptive and wise, and by his teens, he had already taken a liking to the Laozi and Zhuangzi. He Yan, the Minister of Personnel, marveled at him, saying: "Such a person as this may be spoken to of the boundary between Heaven and humanity."

When He Yan had just completed his commentary on the *Laozi*, he visited Bi and, seeing the precision and wonder of his annotations, thereupon presented his own commentary as the two treatises on *Virtue* and the *Dao*. He then outlined the superior principles from his earlier work and said to Bi: "I had thought these to be the utmost attainable—can they be further challenged?" Bi promptly composed a refutation before the assembled company, and He Yan was thereby bested.

Bi once established a thesis holding that Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things all take non-being as their root. That which is primordial is what opens things and accomplishes affairs, present without fail in all places. Yin and yang rely upon it to transform and generate; the myriad things rely upon it to take form; the worthy rely upon it to perfect their virtue; the unworthy rely upon it to preserve themselves. Thus, though it bears no rank, it is most noble.

Bi also composed a *Commentary on the Book of Changes*, which later Confucians revered.

During the Jin dynasty, Sun Deng, styled Gonghe, was a native of Jijun. He had no family and dwelled in an earthen cave in the northern mountains of his commandery. He delighted in reading the *Book of Changes* and would strum a single-stringed zither. His nature was free of resentment or anger. Once, someone cast him into the water to provoke his anger. When Deng emerged, he simply laughed aloud.

Once, he resided in Yiyang, where charcoal-burners in the mountains saw him and knew he was no ordinary man. They spoke to Deng, but he did not respond. When Emperor Wen of Wei heard of this, he sent Ruan Ji to observe him. After meeting and speaking with Deng, Ruan Ji likewise received no answer. Ji Kang accompanied him for three years, repeatedly asking about his aims, but Deng never answered. As Kang was about to take his leave, he said, "Sir, will you truly say nothing?" Deng then replied: "Do you understand fire? It is born with light, yet does not use its light—its fruit lies in using the light. A person is born with talent, yet does not use their talent—its fruit lies in using that talent. Thus, using light depends on obtaining fuel to preserve its radiance; using talent depends on recognizing truth to preserve one’s life. Now, you have much talent but little understanding—it will be difficult for you to escape the perils of this age. Do not seek more." Kang could not follow his advice. Later, he wrote the *Poem of Hidden Grief*, saying: "Once I felt shame before Liu Xia, now I feel shame before Sun Deng." In the end, no one knew how Deng’s life concluded.

**Daoist Adept Guo Wen**
Guo Wen, styled Wenju, was a native of Ruan in Henan. From youth, he loved mountains and rivers and esteemed reclusion. Whenever he wandered among them, he would forget to return for weeks. After his parents passed and he completed mourning, he never married. Leaving home, he roamed famous mountains, wearing only a deerskin robe and a hempen headscarf. He gathered bamboo leaves and wild fruits to barter for grain, using it to sustain himself, and any surplus he gave to the poor and needy. When Wang Dao heard of his reputation, he sent someone to invite him. Upon arrival, Wen was lodged in the Western Garden. Wenjiao once asked, "Sir, do you truly have no emotions when living alone?" Wen replied, "Emotions arise from memory; without memory, there are no emotions." Wenjiao then asked, "Living alone in desolate mountains, if you fall ill or meet your end, or are eaten by crows and kites, would that not be cruel?" Wen said, "Those buried in graves are also eaten by ants—what difference is there?" Once, when Wang Dao hosted a gathering of guests with music, he summoned Wen to listen. Wen stared blankly, striding across the ornate hall as if walking through a forest. At that time, all present spoke of profound and far-reaching matters. Wen often claimed to have grasped the "language of the enlightened" and the "resounding mechanism of heaven," yet none could fathom his teachings. One day, he suddenly requested to return to the mountains. When Su Jun later rebelled and entered the capital, many believed Wen had foreseen this and thus departed. Ge Hong and Yu Chan both wrote biographies praising his virtue, saying: "In the Liang dynasty, he was posthumously enfeoffed as the Perfected Lord of Numinous Radiance."

**Daoist Adept Ji Kang**
Ji Kang, styled Shuye, was a native of Qiao in Qiao Commandery. Orphaned young, he possessed extraordinary talent, surpassing his peers in excellence. Standing seven feet and eight inches tall, he had a fine command of language and a dignified bearing, yet treated his body as mere earth and wood, never adorning himself. People regarded him as having the bearing of a dragon or phoenix, his nature bestowed by heaven. Though he had no formal teacher, he read widely and mastered all he studied. Married into the imperial Wei clan, he was appointed Gentleman of the Palace. He practiced Daoist arts of nourishing life and consuming elixirs, playing the zither and reciting poetry to express his feelings, believing that immortality was innate in the nature of transcendents, not achieved through accumulated study. As for self-cultivation, he held that attaining the principle brought peace, and that one could aspire to the longevity of Peng Zu. Thus, he wrote the *Discourse on Nourishing Life*. Whenever he reflected on those with whom he shared a spiritual affinity, only Ruan Ji of Chenliu and Shan Tao of Henan came to mind. Among those who followed their example were Xiang Xiu and Liu Ling. Ruan Ji’s nephew Ruan Xian and Wang Rong also joined their company, forming the "Bamboo Grove" gatherings. Wang Rong once said that in the twenty years he lived with Kang in Shanyang, he never saw him display anger or joy. Kang often gathered herbs in mountains and marshes; when he found something to his liking, he would forget to return. Once, Qiao Su encountered him and called him a divine being. When he met Sun Deng in the mountains of Ji Commandery, he accompanied him for a time. Deng remained silent, guarding his solitude, and said nothing. As Kang was leaving, he begged for a final word. Deng said, "Your talent is indeed lofty, but you lack the Way to preserve yourself." Later, he met Wang Lie, and together they entered the mountains. Lie once obtained a stone marrow resembling maltose; he consumed half and gave the rest to Kang, which both hardened into stone. In a stone chamber, they saw a scroll of plain silk, and Lie hastily called Kang to retrieve it, but it vanished. Lie sighed, "Shuye’s aspirations are extraordinary, yet he is never favored by fate." When Shan Tao was about to leave his post as a selection official, he recommended Kang as his replacement. Kang then wrote a letter to Tao severing ties, saying: "I have heard that Daoist adepts say consuming the herb huangjing grants long life—I deeply believe this. Roaming mountains and marshes to observe fish and birds brings me great joy. If I were to become an official, this would all be abandoned. How could I forsake what I love for what I fear? Now, I only wish to dwell in a humble lane, teach and raise my children, occasionally reunite with old friends to reminisce about the past, share a cup of unstrained wine, and play a tune on the zither—this fulfills my aspirations." After this letter circulated, people knew he could not be restrained or bent to their will.

Bao Shuo, the Governor of Nanhai, was a spiritually attuned man. Xu Ning of Donghai was his disciple. One night, Ning heard the sound of a zither coming from Shuo’s chamber. Marveling at its beauty, he asked about it, and Shuo said, "It is Ji Shuye." Ning said, "Ji was executed in the eastern market—how could he be here?" Shuo replied, "Shuye’s form perished, but in truth, his body underwent liberation through simulated death." See Gu Kaizhi’s *Eulogy for Ji Kang*.

**Ruan Ji**
Ruan Ji, styled Sizong, was a native of Weishi in Chenliu. His appearance was striking, his ambitions vast and unrestrained. Proud and self-contained, he followed his emotions without restraint, yet his joy and anger never showed on his face. Sometimes he would shut himself indoors to read, not emerging for months; other times, he would climb mountains or face rivers, forgetting to return for days. He read widely, especially favoring the works of Zhuangzi and Laozi. He once wrote the *Discourse on Understanding Zhuangzi*, extolling the value of non-action, though much of his writing is no longer extant. He composed over eight thousand *Poems of My Heart*, which were highly esteemed. Fond of wine, skilled in whistling, and adept at playing the zither, when he was in high spirits, he would forget his own form, and many at the time called him mad. Hearing that the armory of the Northern Army had skilled brewers and stored three hundred *hu* of wine, he sought the post of Colonel of the Northern Army, thereby distancing himself from worldly affairs.

He was also capable of the "green-and-white eye," meeting conventional scholars with the white eye. Once, in the mountains of Sumen, he encountered Sun Deng and discussed with him the affairs of ancient times, as well as the arts of aligning the spirit and guiding qi, but Sun remained silent. Ji then let out a long whistle and withdrew. Halfway down the ridge, he heard a sound like the cry of a phoenix, echoing through the cliffs and valleys—it was Sun Deng’s whistle. Upon returning, he wrote the *Biography of the Great Man*, the gist of which reads: The so-called gentlemen of the world devote themselves only to laws and restrain themselves only by rites. They hold jade tablets in their hands and walk the line of the inked cord. Their conduct aims at immediate gain, while their blindness seeks endless fame. In youth, they win praise in their villages; in maturity, their names spread to neighboring states. Above, they aspire to the rank of the Three Dukes; below, they do not demean themselves to govern a province. Yet have they not seen the lice in a pair of trousers? They flee into seams and hide in the padding, thinking it a fortunate abode. They dare not stray from the edges of the seams nor move beyond the folds of the cloth, believing they follow the inked cord. But when flames rage and fire spreads, burning cities to ash, the lice trapped in the trousers cannot escape. How are the gentlemen within the world any different? This, too, is the essence of Ji’s intent.

Often, he would drive alone as he pleased, not following the beaten path. When his carriage could go no farther, he would weep bitterly and turn back. Once, he climbed the Guangwu Terrace, where Chu and Han had battled, and sighed: "Had there been true heroes in that age, this mediocrity would never have made a name for himself." He died in the fourth year of the Jingyuan era. Daoist and Confucian.

Xiang Xiu, styled Ziqī, was a native of Huai in Henei. Clear-minded and far-seeing, he was deeply fond of the learning of Laozi and Zhuangzi. In his youth, he was recognized by Shan Tao. Beyond the existing commentaries on Zhuang Zhou’s Inner and Outer Chapters, Xiu composed his own exegesis, unfolding subtle wonders and profoundly expanding the spirit of the Dao. Only the chapters *Autumn Floods* and *Supreme Joy* (first part) remained unfinished. During the reign of Emperor Hui, Guo Xiang, styled Zixuan, later expanded upon his work.

Xiu befriended Ji Kang and Lü An, though their inclinations diverged. Kang was proud and unrestrained by worldly conventions, while An was carefree and detached from the common. Xiu, however, was refined and devoted to his studies. Before commencing his commentary on the *Zhuangzi*, he informed Kang and An, who both remarked, "This book needs no further annotation—it would only waste a man’s time that could be spent in joy." When the work was completed and shown to them, Kang said, "So, you have indeed surpassed us." An, astonished, exclaimed, "Zhuang Zhou is not dead after all!"

He also annotated the *Book of Changes*, its grand meanings worthy of admiration, though it differed in places from the Han scholars, not quite matching the unparalleled brilliance of his *Zhuangzi* commentary. Kang was skilled in forging metal, and Xiu often assisted him, the two working together in serene harmony, as if no one else were present.

Later, Xiu traveled to Luoyang on official business for his commandery. Emperor Wen asked him, "I have heard of your aspiration to dwell in the mountains like Jizi and Xu You. Why then are you here?" Xiu replied, "Those reclusive gentlemen, though upright, did not fully grasp the heart of Yao. How could they be truly worthy of admiration?" The emperor was greatly pleased.

Afterward, a neighbor played the flute, its clear and resonant notes stirring memories of past gatherings with Ji Kang. Moved by the music, he sighed and composed the *Rhapsody on Remembering the Past*. He rose to the position of Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary before his death. Daoist and Confucian.

Royal Fu, styled Shian, was known in childhood as Jing. A native of Anding, he was the great-grandson of Han Grand Commandant Song. At twenty, he had no interest in learning. Later in life, he studied under his townsman Xi Tan, farming while carrying books at his waist, and thus mastered the classics and the teachings of the Hundred Schools. Composed and restrained in desire, he began to harbor lofty aspirations. Devoting himself to writing, he styled himself Master Xuan Yan. He composed treatises on ritual, music, and the sagely and true.

Later afflicted with wind-bi illness, he never set down his scrolls. Some urged him to cultivate fame and broaden his connections, to which he responded with his *Discourse on Guarding the Mysterious*: "Poverty is the constant lot of the scholar; lowliness is the ruin of the Way." Thus, he did not pursue worldly glory. Immersed in the study of ancient texts, he forgot his illness and even his meals, earning the epithet "book-addict" from his contemporaries. When others admonished him that such excess would deplete his spirit, he replied, "If one hears the Dao in the morning, one may die that evening—how much more when the span of life is fixed by fate and hangs in the heavens?"

He was recommended as Filial and Incorrupt and summoned by the Chancellor, then nominated as Worthy and Upright and Square and Proper, but declined all appointments. He petitioned Emperor Wu to borrow books, and the emperor sent him a cartload. Though weak with illness, he pored over them without rest. Repeated summonses went unanswered, and he died in the second year of the *Great Prosperity* era.

His works—*Annals of Emperors and Kings*, *Biographies of Lofty Scholars, Reclusive Scholars, and Exemplary Women*—were all esteemed in the world.

*Record of the Mysterious Ranks, Scroll Three*

The *Daoist Ranks*, compiled by Zhang Tianyu of Haiyang, Wu Commandery, Outer Historian of Juqu

Ge Hong, styled Zhichuan, was a native of Jurong in Danyang. From youth he loved learning, but his family was poor, so he personally felled firewood to trade for paper and ink. By night he copied texts and practiced recitation, becoming renowned for his Confucian scholarship. By nature he was indifferent to desires, taking no delight in playthings—he did not know the number of lines on a chessboard or the names of dice. His manner was plain and unassuming, and he cared nothing for fame or profit. He shut his gate and swept the path, never socializing. Occasionally, when seeking books or inquiring into doctrines, he would travel thousands of *li* over rugged terrain, enduring hardship to obtain what he sought.

He was especially fond of the methods of divine transcendents and nurturing life. His granduncle Ge Xuan had studied the Dao and attained immortality, known as the Divine Lord Ge. Having inherited the secret alchemical arts from his disciple Zheng Yi, Hong withdrew to study and mastered all his teachings.

In the early *Xianhe* era, the Two Ministers of Works, Wang Dao, summoned him to serve as a clerk in the provincial administration, and later selected him as Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary and Director of the Palace Library, but he firmly declined all appointments. In his later years, wishing to refine the elixir, he heard that cinnabar was produced in Jiaozhi and requested the post of Magistrate of Goulou. The emperor, considering Hong’s lofty standing, refused, but Hong said, “I do not seek honor—only the cinnabar.” The emperor relented. On his way to the post, he reached Guangzhou, where the regional inspector Deng Yue detained him and would not permit him to proceed. Thus, he remained on Mount Luofu to refine the elixir. There he spent years in leisurely cultivation, never ceasing his writings.

In his preface, he wrote: “Hong’s physique and talent are but middling, yet by chance he favors the work of nonaction. Were he given old wings, he could soar through the empyrean; with swift feet, he could chase the wind and tread upon shadows. Yet he would still wish to fold his strong pinions among the flock of sparrows, to hide his swiftness among the ranks of lame donkeys. How could he presume to strain the short wings bestowed by the great clod or the halting steps lent by creation? Having examined himself and knowing his limits, how dare he strive like a fly to emulate the soaring of the heavens, or urge a lame turtle to follow the tracks of the flying hare? Thus, he turns away from the path of glory and finds peace in the realm of poverty and ruin. The lotus in the marsh enjoys the sweetness of the eight delicacies; the humble hut delights in the splendor of embroidered curtains.

Worldly scholars cling only to the teachings of Zhou and Kong, disbelieving the books of divine transcendents. Not only do they laugh at them, but they slander what is true and correct. Therefore, in my work *Baopuzi*, comprising *Inner* and *Outer Chapters* in one hundred sixteen scrolls, though it may not be worthy of concealment in the famous mountains, I shall at least seal it in a golden casket to show those who understand.

Thus, I have named the book after myself. Hong’s learning was vast, his knowledge unmatched in the lands south of the Yangtze. His writings in scope surpassed those of Ban [Gu] and Sima [Qian]. He was also keenly discerning in matters of the mysterious and subtle, analyzing principles with precision.”

One day, as he sat until midday, he suddenly appeared to doze off and passed away at the age of eighty-one. His complexion remained as if alive, his body soft and supple. When lifted into the coffin, he was as light as an empty robe—truly, he had departed through *shijie*, the transformation of a transcendent.

**Daoist Lineage**
Wang Xizhi, styled Yishao, was the nephew of Minister Wang Dao. Proficient in clerical script, he was unrivaled in ancient and modern times. Critics praised his brushwork as "floating like drifting clouds, supple as a startled dragon." He often declared, "My calligraphy stands shoulder to shoulder with Zhong [Yao], while my cursive script surpasses Zhang [Zhi]’s as a flock of crows in flight." Deeply esteemed by his elder cousin Wang Dun, he began his career as Gentleman of the Secretariat and later served as General of the Right Army and Governor of Kuaiji. Xizhi favored Daoist practices of nourishing life and disdained residing in the capital. Upon crossing the Zhe River, he resolved to spend his final years there. Kuaiji boasted fine mountains and waters, attracting many renowned scholars, including Xie An, who dwelled there before taking office. Once, he gathered with like-minded friends for a feast at Orchid Pavilion in Shanyin. Xizhi composed a preface for the occasion, and some compared it to Pan Yue’s *Preface to the Jin Gu Poems*, likening Xizhi to Shi Chong—news that greatly pleased him.

He had a fondness for geese. In Shanyin, a Daoist priest kept fine geese, and Xizhi went to observe them. Delighted, he sought to purchase them. The priest replied, "If you transcribe the *Daodejing* for me, I shall gift you the entire flock." Xizhi happily complied, and upon finishing, he carried the geese home in a basket—such was his uninhibited nature. Later, he claimed illness to resign his post, composing a vow at his parents’ graves never to re-enter officialdom. After leaving office, he roamed the mountains and waters with eastern scholars and, alongside Master Xu Mai, practiced Daoist arts of ingesting herbs and elixirs. He died at fifty-nine.

**Daoist Ranks**
Xu Mai, styled Shu Xuan, also named Ying, hailed from Jurong in Danyang. From childhood, he was drawn to the Dao, secretly forming profound bonds. Once, he consulted Guo Pu for divination, drawing the hexagram *Great Strength* transforming into *Great Possession*, with the top line activated. Guo told him, "Your fortune is supremely auspicious. Heaven itself deems you fit to study the Way of light ascension." Initially, he studied under Bao Shuo, receiving the *Central Scripture* and the *Inner Writ of the Three Sovereigns*. One day, he bid farewell to his family, noting that Suspended Torrent Mountain in Yuhang lay near Maoshan in Yanling—the western gate of Dongting, a port connecting the Five Peaks, where Chen Anshi and Mao Jiwei had once wandered. There, he established a retreat at Suspended Torrent and frequented the grotto chambers of Maoshan. On the first and fifteenth of each month, he returned home to pay respects, but after his parents’ deaths, he sent his wife, Lady Sun, back to her family, letting his hair down to shed worldly burdens and renaming himself *Xuan* (Mystery).

He traveled extensively with Wang Xizhi and his sons, and Wang Ziyou held him in the highest reverence. In a letter to Xizhi, he wrote: "South of Shanyin to Lin’an, there are many golden halls and jade chambers, along with immortal herbs and the disciples of Zuo Yuanfang—all those who attained the Dao in the late Han still reside there." In the autumn of the fourth year of Yonghe, he vanished into the western mountains of Lin’an, then entered Red Mountain in Linhai, where he encountered worthy companions: Wang Shilong, Zhao Daoxuan, and Fu Taichu. He became Shilong’s disciple, receiving the Way of Unbinding and practicing the Method of Reverse Circulation. He ingested jade nectar and refined brain essence. Within two or three years, his face radiated light, his youthful complexion restored—he had achieved the Dao.

Thereupon, the Controller of Destiny on Maoshan, upon reviewing the Register of Predestined Efforts, recommended him to the Upper Palace. His name was transferred to the Eastern Realm, and he was appointed an Earthbound Transcendent. At that time, the Left Minister of the Three Offices’ Central Prohibition Bureau dispatched Zhou Fang, Keeper of the Authority, along with the non-official envoy Yan Baihu, to Red Mountain. They sought to seize him, demanding an account of his transgressions. Presenting a cinnabar tablet of his criminal record, each holding a copy, they questioned Ying: "Those who aspire to the Dao, emulate the immortals, and serve the Perfected Ones must possess worldly merits, avoid calamities and misfortunes, accumulate hidden virtues, and extend benevolence to the highest spirits before they may tread the path of transcendence and inscribe their names in the grotto heavens. How, then, do you explain your father’s murder of Xie Gong, an act of rebellion against the Three Luminaries? You also beheaded Li Ji in place of Cai Fu’s head, slew and dismembered Pan Cai’s attendants, drowned Tang Yun’s corpse, burned Xu Ang’s remains, strangled Huan Zheng, hacked Zhen Shi to pieces—forty-three acts of cruelty, violence, and indiscriminate punishment. Your grievous deeds are recorded in the Mountain of Calamity under the Heavenly Emperor, yet you have no virtuous merits to offset them. Moreover, you originally followed the Way of the Bo family, consuming living beings and accruing karmic debts from past lives, all listed in the Three Offices’ records. Yet you brazenly evaded the net of justice, pledging yourself to the Perfected Qi. Your father and you, though kin, served different masters, living in discord and refusing to share libations. Your crimes are grave, and the dark judgment is imminent. With such accumulated sins, no immortal would deign to associate with you. How dare you deceive the envoys of the Most High and inscribe your name on the Purple Register of Undying? If you have no defense, the authorities will surely seize you."

Ying let out a long, resonant whistle, straightened his robe, and ran his fingers through his hair. Then, composing his breath and parting his lips, he retorted fiercely: "The Great Dao is impartial, favoring only the good. Heaven and Earth are without intent, yet they show mercy to the virtuous. Thus, the blood of Ji Quan’s flow did not hinder the dragon’s ascent, nor did the crimson fields of San Miao or the scarlet grasses of Zhuolu impede the sagely transformations of the lofty and transcendent. My seventh-generation ancestor, Xu Zia, accumulated benevolence and amassed virtue, extending kindness even to birds and beasts. During years of famine and plague, when the people starved and disease raged, leaving barely one in a hundred alive, Zia distributed his family’s wealth to save the masses. He personally prepared remedies, laboring tirelessly in the fields. When others mourned the dead, he grieved as if for his own kin; when others suffered, he ached as if afflicted himself. He snatched the dying from the jaws of death, cradling the destitute as his own children."

Those rescued from calamitous years and preserved through Zia numbered four hundred and eight. His benevolence and virtue did not fade, and later would be bestowed upon us. Thus, his merits were inscribed before the August Emperor, his virtue engraved in the Numinous Pavilion, ensuring our ancestral roots flowed with generational blessings and our descendants basked in their radiance. Hence, the branches bore blossoms, and those born with an affinity for transcendence numbered five who attained deliverance from the world, three who ascended in glory—all their names recorded in the Azure Palace upon the Supreme One’s jade tablets. How could the likes of you ever partake in such destiny?

As these words concluded, Fang and the others burst into sudden laughter. At that moment, the Lord of Life’s Destiny dispatched the Attendant Li Zun, who arrived brandishing a fiery bell to rebuke and command them. Thereupon, Fang and the White Tiger fled in haste. Before Li Zun’s arrival, Ying had been so stricken with terror that his gallbladder failed and his qi dissipated. Had his master, Wang Shilong, not intervened to answer on Ying’s behalf, the outcome would have nearly been disastrous. Thus, Ying’s name was recorded in the Eastern Palace as one destined for middling transcendence.

In the third year of Liang Qianhua, the seventh month, he was enfeoffed as the True Lord of Reversion to Unity, the Lord of Life’s Destiny, and the Great Lord Mao of the Three Mao Peaks.

Daoist Register:
Xie An, styled Anshi, a native of Yangxia in Chen Commandery.

Xie An, though raised in Confucian scholarship, pursued little of its practice yet bore a weighty reputation. Dwelling in Kuaiji, he would venture forth to fish and hunt amidst mountains and rivers, then return to discourse on flavors and compose literature. He harbored no worldly ambitions, sitting in a stone chamber overlooking a deep ravine, sighing in leisure: "How far removed is this from Boyi?"

Xie excelled in expounding the *Zhuangzi* and *Laozi*. One day, he gathered with Zhi Dun and Xu Xun at Wang Meng’s home. Turning to the assembly, Xie remarked: "Today may be called a gathering of worthies. Since time cannot be detained and such assemblies are rarely constant, let us discourse on refined tastes to express our sentiments." Xu then asked the host if he possessed the *Zhuangzi*, and upon finding only the chapter *"The Old Fisherman,"* Xie examined the title and proposed that each of the four present expound it in turn.

Zhi Daolin spoke first, delivering some seven hundred words. His phrasing was exquisite, his talent striking, his diction surpassing all, and all praised him. When each had finished sharing their thoughts, Xie asked: "Have you all exhausted your insights?" They replied: "Today has been like antiquity itself—we have scarcely held back." Xie then raised subtle objections, refining his own interpretation in over ten thousand words, his talent soaring with elegance. Having surpassed even his own challenges, his spirit soared as if borne aloft, leaving the entire assembly deeply satisfied. Zhi remarked: "Your single-minded pursuit has made this all the more excellent."

When Emperor Jianwen later served as regent, he observed: "Since Anshi delights in sharing joy with others, he cannot refuse to share their sorrows. If summoned, he will surely come." At the time, his younger brother Xie Wan bore heavy responsibilities in the fiefdoms, yet though Xie An dwelt in a humble gate, his renown surpassed even Wan’s, naturally evoking expectations of high office. At over forty, he first harbored ambitions for official service, and the General of the Western Expedition invited him to serve as his adjutant. As he prepared to depart from Xinting, court officials all came to see him off. Gao Song teased him: "You have repeatedly defied imperial decrees, dwelling deep in the eastern mountains. Many have said, ‘If Anshi refuses to emerge, what will become of the common people? Now the common people must ask, what will become of you?’"

Later, as regent, Xie An governed during a time of great turmoil in the Jin dynasty, yet with refined magnanimity he steadied the realm, responding to crises with unhurried discourse and laughter. He curbed Huan Wen’s rebellious ambitions, appointed worthy talents, and shattered Fu Jian’s million-strong army. His achievements rivaled those of Wang Dao and Wen Qiao. Though he accepted office, his resolve to retire to the eastern mountains remained unwavering. When he was sent to garrison Xincheng, he prepared his entire household for a sea voyage, intending to lead an expedition to roughly pacify the region before returning east by river. His lofty aspirations remained unfulfilled when he passed away, and he was posthumously enfeoffed as Grand Tutor, with the posthumous title *Wenjing*. The True Virtue of the Western Mountains, Zhu Xi, remarked: "Xie An held power for sixteen years, first thwarting the usurpation schemes of powerful ministers, then blunting the aggressive ambitions of formidable enemies—his merits were immense. Yet was his original intent ever to pursue fame and achievement? His noble character and refined bearing nearly approached the spirit of Kongming and Zifang."

Daoist Register.

Yang Xi, styled Yihe, was a native of Wu Commandery who later relocated his family to Jurong. Born in the ninth month of the gengyin year of the fifth Xianhe reign (330 CE), he displayed spiritual sensitivity from childhood, possessed a graceful bearing, and excelled in speech and humor. Skilled in calligraphy and painting, he rivaled Wang Xizhi in renown throughout the land. Though his age differed greatly from that of Perfected Master Xu Mai and Director Mu, he early formed a bond of divine affinity with them. When Emperor Jianwen was Prince of Langye and appointed Chancellor, Director Mu recommended him as a clerk in the princely administration. Yet upon the emperor’s accession, he sought no promotion. Like his uncle, who renounced worldly honors and cultivated profound meditation to attain spiritual resonance, in the fifth year of Yonghe (349 CE) he received the *Tiger and Leopard Methods* from the Master of the Central Yellow, and in the sixth year (350 CE) he transmitted the *Five Numinous Talismans of the Numinous Treasure* from Liu Pu, eldest son of Lady Wei. At twenty-one, in the sixth month of the third Xingning reign (365 CE), the Purple Void Primordial Sovereign, Lady Ziwei, and the Ninth Flower Peaceful Consort descended to his home, or sometimes to Director Mu’s mountain retreat on Maoshan. The scriptures and revelations he transmitted were copied and shown to Master Xu and his son, and from this time he became the master who transmitted the scriptures to Director Mu.

The Ninth Flower Peaceful Consort, who had come to fulfill her destined pairing, once declared to him: “Your luminous nature is pure and serene, your secret compositions as radiant as jade and as deep as an orchid pool, your noble spirit a resonant echo in the golden palace. You are one who treasures hidden marvels, whose inner truth shines with numinous splendor. You brandish the sacred texts, ride the cycles of fate, and follow the currents of life. Your pristine virtue is the garden of the gods, your cinnabar and gold the purity of jade. You kindle mist and summon light, your hidden drum echoes afar. You shall become one of the Three Eminent Ministers, attendant upon the Celestial Emperor’s person. A lofty aide to the Four Assistants, you shall receive the commands of the Sagely Lord. You shall govern life and sever death, reward and punish spirits. You shall command a thousand numina, seal mountains and summon clouds. You shall oversee the harmonious qi of yin and yang, and be appointed Lord of the Spirits of Wu and Yue.”

Among the Three Bureaus there was once a saying: *“Yang An, Great Lord, / Overseer of the Divine Mandate.”* This referred to none other than him. You shall ride the dragon and mount the clouds, ascending to heaven in broad daylight.

Should one find oneself unable to endure the smoke of wind and fire, yet wish to embrace the true form within secluded groves, one may then seek the Way of the Sword’s Release, or practice the Art of the Final Declaration. At the juncture where silence and expression part, where concealment and revelation diverge, the choice shall rest with the enlightened lord.

The Perfected King of Western Citadel’s Totality further taught the method of absorbing the essence of the sun and moon. Emperor Jianwen of the Liang followed him as his master, and in the eleventh year of the Taiyuan reign, the bingxu year, released his carriage at the age of fifty-seven.

The *Exhortative Edict of the Xuanhe Reign* of the Song states: *“We abide in the Azure Palace, gazing upon the Dragon Terrace. We behold the divine realm of flourishing beauty, and aspire to the wondrous teachings of the Nine Splendors. Revering the footsteps of the ranked immortals, we illuminate this work of unfolding transformation. The Upper Aide of the Commandery of the Bound Flowers, Yang the Perfected, has accumulated learning in the profound and delved into the subtle, refining his heart to merge with the vast. He obtained the hidden formulas of the Central Yellow, and received the secret transmissions of the Southern Perfected. He oversees the frontiers and passes of Wu and Yue, and governs the essential methods of the spirit numina. Soaring upon the Supreme Dao, he is fittingly exalted with the highest of honors. May the abiding gaze of his profound discernment ever expand the bestowal of our favor.”* Thus, he was specially enfeoffed with the title *Perfected of Mysterious Numinosity and Manifest Transformation*.

**Register of Daoist Attainments**
Xu Mu, styled Sixuan, also named Mi, was a native of Pingyu in Runan. His sixth-generation ancestor, Xu Guang, relocated to Danyang. He was born in the second year of the Yongxing reign, the yichou year.

He began his career as a Doctor of the Imperial Academy, then served as Magistrate of Yuyao, was summoned to the post of Gentleman of the Imperial Secretariat, and was later promoted to Chief Examiner of the Commandery, Protector-General’s Chief Clerk, and Gentleman-Consultant of the Yellow Gate with the concurrent title of Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary. Outwardly, he blended with the affairs of the world; inwardly, he cultivated the learning of the True. Once, admiring his elder brother’s lofty example of wandering far, he encountered the passing of Emperor Jianwen and devoted himself to seclusion in a mountain hut. He formed a bond of spirit and understanding with Master Yang Shen, and during the Xingning era, a host of Perfected descended to transmit scriptures and precepts to Yang in full. In the first year of the Taiyuan reign, he departed this life at the age of seventy-two. His sons and nephews, observing the rites, interred his empty coffin in the great tomb west of the city walls.

The *True Declarations* states: “His destiny was long rooted in the Green Enterprise of the Mandate. He was the younger brother of Xue, the Duke of Changli of the Nine Palaces, from the time of King Wu of Zhou. Inheriting the legacy of Xu Zhao’s merit, he was also destined to bestow blessings upon his descendants. Thus, he rode the turning of the times to be reborn, and by virtue of his endowment, he attained the Dao. The Jade Token conferred upon him the rank of Perfected of the Supreme Clarity, with a noble title of marquis or earl and a position among the ministers and directors. He governs the affairs of immortals and assists the sagely in shepherding the people.”

The *Exhortatory Edict of the Xuanhe Reign* says: “We descend to the Jade Realm of the Assembly of Perfected and illuminate the Dragon Terrace of Lu Yao’s radiance. We bestow the succession upon the primordial shoulders to aid the living in the world below. All who have distinguished themselves in the ranks of the Dao are advanced in position among the lineages of immortals. The Perfected of the Supreme Clarity, Gentleman-Consultant Xu, is pure and refined in outward demeanor, while inwardly attaining spirit and clarity. His numinous voice flows eloquently, secretly joining the company of the host of sages. Reverently mounting his carriage, he soars afar to loftily assist in the governance of the Supreme Clarity. As he spreads the net of the Great Brahma, it is fitting to exalt him with a title of virtue and renown. May the vast bestowal of our profound favor ever expand the transformation of primordial efficacy.” Thus, he was specially enfeoffed with the title *Perfected of Vast Virtue of the Taiyuan Era*.

Xu Ke, styled Daoxiang, with the childhood name Jade Axe, was the third son of the Gentleman-Consultant. Clear, bright, and pure, he surpassed all his contemporaries. He was born in the first month of the seventh year of the Xiankang reign, the xinchou year. The commandery recommended him as a Filial and Incorrupt Candidate and nominated him as Registrar to the Minister of Works, but he declined both appointments. He built a residence before Thunder Flat Mountain in Gouqu and secretly cultivated the Supreme Dao. In the seventh month of the third year of the Xingning reign, the Lady of the Purple Tenuity descended to instruct him. From then on, he exchanged written correspondence with the host of Perfected, fully practicing the methods of *Returning to the Origin and Flying Steps of the Two Radiant Ones* and *Yilin*. He once wished to journey early to the Grotto Chambers and had no desire to linger long in the human world. In the fifth year of the Taihe reign, the gengwu year, he went to the Northern Grotto to announce his end. The Northern Grotto is the Grotto of Constant Excellence. He was thirty years old at the time.

According to the oral tradition of the elders: “Ke was burning incense and prostrating in worship upon the stone altar of the Northern Grotto when he suddenly bowed down and did not rise. The next morning, his form appeared as if still living.” The Junior Lord of Mao instructed: “Xu’s son was able to relinquish his form and undergo a hidden transformation, following the example of Zhang Zhennan’s nocturnal departure. Zhennan was the third-generation lineage master of the Celestial Master, Lu.” From then on, he dwelled in the grotto chambers of the four directions and frequently came to the Four-Square Terrace.

The *True Declarations* states: “Sixteen years later, he will ascend to govern the Eastern Flower as a Perfected Duke of the Supreme Clarity, and in seclusion, he will be known as the True Master of the Mysterious Center.”

The *Xuanhe Edict* enfeoffed him as *Perfected of Primordial Oneness and Mysterious Transformation*. The edict reads: “The Purple Ultimate contains the primordial, though the vast primeval is but a single qi. The Cinnabar Terrace lists the registers, truly ordering the ranks of the myriad Perfected. All who are exalted in position among the lineages of immortals thereby extend the merit of the Dao’s beginning. The Perfected of the Supreme Clarity, Attendant of the Eastern Flower, Xu, delved into the three spirits to contemplate the wondrous and concentrated the nine wefts to bring forth his destiny. Announcing his end at the Northern Grotto, he freely followed the integrity of the reclusive. Treading the radiance of the Eastern Flower, he alone transcended the company of the highest ministers. Though he loftily withdrew from worldly renown, he dared not forget the shade of benevolence. May the profound bestowal of our favor ever expand the primordial net.”

**Daoist Guardians**
Liu Linzhi, styled Zijì, also styled Yimin, was a native of Nanyang. From youth, he esteemed simplicity and modesty, was retiring, and had few desires. He did not cultivate formal conduct, and no one knew of him. He loved to wander among mountains and marshes, his ambition set on following the free. Once, while gathering herbs in the depths of Mount Heng, he went so far that he forgot to return. He came upon a deep pool, and to its south stood two large fungi. One was closed, the other open. The water was too broad to cross. Some said that within were all manner of immortal recipes, numinous medicines, and various objects. Linzhi wished to search further but never again found the place. He accepted no gifts from anyone. More than a hundred li from Linzhi’s home, a solitary old woman was dying. She sighed and said to those around her: “Who will bury me? Only Gentleman-Consultant Liu.” How could he have known? Linzhi had already heard of her illness and gone to visit her. Arriving just as she passed, he personally arranged for her coffin and burial. Such was his benevolence and compassion.

One day, he heard that a fisherman from the creek of Wuling had entered the Peach Blossom Spring and was eager to go. Before he could fulfill his wish, he soon passed away. In the *Record of Recluse Tao*, he is called a lofty scholar, and one can well imagine his character.

Suo Xi, a native of Dunhuang, was retiring and fond of learning. He did not respond to the summons of the prefecture or commandery. Though nominated as a Filial and Incorrupt Candidate and a Worthy and Upright Candidate, he declined all on grounds of illness.

Xu You pondered deeply on the arts of yin and yang, composing over ten scrolls on astronomy and geography, offering many insights. During Zhang Mao’s reign, he was visited by Yin Dan, the Prefect of Dunhuang, who marveled at his learning and stayed for days, forgetting to return. Xu soon fell ill and died at the age of seventy-nine. Yin Dan wore mourning garb at his funeral and bestowed two myriad coins. He said: "What the world deems abundant is wealth and nobility; what the eye delights in are the five colors; what the ear savors are the five tones. Yet the Master cast aside what the multitude gathers and gathered what the multitude casts aside. He savored the flavorless amid the indistinct, prized the profound within the myriad wonders. His dwelling spanned no more than an acre, yet his aspirations roamed the Nine Provinces. His form dwelt in the dust of the world, yet his mind soared beyond the heavens. Even the lofty detachment of Qian Lou or Zhuangzi’s disdain for worldly honors cannot surpass him." Thus he posthumously honored him as Master of the Profound Abode.

**True Recluse**
Zhang Zhong, styled Chenhe, was a native of Zhongshan. During the Yongjia upheaval, he took refuge on Mount Tai. Serene and desireless, he cultivated emptiness and ingested qi. He ate pine needles and tree bark, practicing the arts of guiding and pulling. He did not study scriptures or preach teachings, but took the supreme Dao’s emptiness and origin as his foundation. His dwelling clung to sheer cliffs and deep valleys, where he carved out a cave-chamber. His disciples also lived in caves, sixty paces from his own, paying homage every five days. His instruction relied on form, not words; disciples observed his bearing and then withdrew. He erected a Dao altar above his cave, bowing to it each dawn. He ate from earthenware vessels, chiseling stone into cauldrons. The villagers around him spun cloth and grew food, yet he accepted nothing. When well-meaning visitors inquired about omens of water or fire, he replied: "Heaven does not speak, yet the four seasons proceed and the myriad things flourish. The workings of yin and yang are not for a rustic old man of the mountains to know." He dismissed such matters as external trifles. In his final years, his sight and hearing faded.

When Fu Jian dispatched envoys to summon him, offering robes and cap, he declined: "My years are decayed, my hair fallen—unfit for robes and cap. Permit me to meet you in my rustic garb." Fu Jian said: "Master, you have roamed the mountains and forests, refining the essence of the Dao. Your virtue in self-cultivation is complete, yet your merit in aiding others remains unfulfilled. Thus I have humbly invited you from afar, intending to entrust you with the role of Grand Tutor." Zhang replied: "Once, fleeing the chaos of war, I took refuge on Mount Tai, consorting with birds and beasts to preserve my life from dawn to dusk. Now, in an age of Yao and Shun, my years are spent and my strength wanes—I cannot render service. The title of Grand Tutor is not one I dare presume. My nature clings to mountain caves; I beg to spend my remaining years and return to die on Mount Tai." Fu Jian sent him off in a carriage, but upon reaching Mount Hua, Zhang sighed: "I am a Daoist of the Eastern Peak, yet I shall perish on the Western Peak—such is fate." After traveling fifty li, he reached the pass and died. The envoy galloped back to report. Fu Jian dispatched the Gentleman of the Yellow Gate, Wei Hua, bearing credentials to offer condolences and posthumous robes, bestowing the title: "Master of Peaceful Dao."

**Daoist and Confucian**
Song Xian, styled Lingwen, was a native of Xiaogu in Dunhuang.

In his youth, Song Xian cultivated lofty aspirations and maintained a serene demeanor, holding no intercourse with the world. He retired to the southern mountains of Jiuquan, delving deeply into the warp and weft of the classics, with over three thousand disciples studying under him. Ma Ji, the Prefect of Jiuquan and a man of noble character, arrayed himself in full ceremonial regalia and, with drums and cymbals resounding, went to visit him. Yet Song Xian, ensconced within his towering pavilions and secluded chambers, refused to receive him. Ma Ji sighed and said: "The Master’s name may be heard, yet his person remains unseen. His virtue may be revered, yet his form cannot be beheld. From this day forth, I know the Master to be a dragon among men." He inscribed a poem upon the stone cliff:

*A red cliff a hundred fathoms high,
A green wall ten thousand spans.
Strange trees luxuriant, dense as the forests of Deng.
This man is like jade—
A treasure of the state.
Though his dwelling is near, the man is far—
Truly, he weighs upon my heart.*

At his death at the age of eighty-three, he was posthumously titled: "Master of Mystic Emptiness."

**Daoist Recluse**
Tao Dan, styled Chujing, was the grandson of the Grand Commandant Tao Kan. Orphaned in childhood, he was fond of arts of nourishing life and believed the Dao of immortality attainable. At fifteen or sixteen, he began to practice grain avoidance and fasting, never marrying. Though his family possessed a thousand gold pieces and numbered a hundred servants and retainers, Tao Dan sat in solemn stillness all day, never troubling himself with their affairs. He was particularly fond of studying the *Book of Changes* and skilled in divination. He built a hut in the mountains of Linxiang in Changsha, keeping a white deer as his companion. When relatives or old friends came to visit, he would shift his dwelling beyond the waters of the Lu River, so none could approach him. When the province nominated him as a Filial and Incorrupt candidate, Tao Dan fled to the mountains of Pi in Luoxian County, never to return, and none knew his fate.

**Daoist Hermit**
Tao Qian, styled Yuanming, was the great-grandson of Tao Kan. From youth, he cherished lofty ideals, was broadly learned, and excelled in literary composition. Gifted and unrestrained, he followed his true nature and lived with ease.

He once composed the *"Biography of the Master of Five Willows"*, presenting himself therein as follows: The Master—no one knew his origins, nor could they ascertain his surname or given name. Beside his dwelling stood five willow trees, and so he took this as his sobriquet. Serene and reticent, he spoke little, scorning worldly glory and gain. He loved to read but sought no deep exegesis; whenever insight struck, he would forget his meal in joy. By nature fond of wine, his poverty left him seldom able to indulge. Relatives and old friends, knowing this, would sometimes set out wine to invite him. He would drink to the last drop, determined to get drunk, and once drunk, depart without a backward glance. His dwelling was but four bare walls, offering scant shelter from wind and sun. His coarse robe was threadbare, his gourd and bamboo basket often empty—yet he remained at ease. He often wrote essays for his own delight, revealing his aspirations. Indifferent to gain or loss, he lived thus to the end.

The *Eulogy* states: QIan Lou once said, *"Neither distressed by poverty and low station, nor eager for wealth and honor."* Taken to its fullest meaning, does this not describe one such as he? He would drink deeply and compose poems in joy. Was he not a man of the age of Wu Huai, or of Ge Tian? Such was his self-portrait, and his contemporaries took it as a true record.

Though his great-grandfather had served as a chief minister of the Jin, he felt shame at bending his will to serve again. When the imperial enterprise of the Song founder began to flourish, he refused all office. In his writings, he always noted the year and month: before the *Yixi* era, he clearly recorded the Jin reign titles; from *Yongchu* onward, he used only the cyclical years. He once remarked that lying beneath his north window in the fifth or sixth month, a chill wind would suddenly arrive, and he would feel himself a man of the age of Fuxi. He died in the fourth year of *Yuanjia*, aged sixty-three. Yan Yanzhi composed his funerary inscription, posthumously styling him *"The Tranquil and Principled Recluse."*

**Daoist Exemplars**
Lu Xiujing, styled Yuanjing, was a native of Dongqian in Wuxing. His father, Lin, declined nine imperial summonses, posthumously honored as *"Master of Lofty Dao, the Recluse."* Lu bore twin moles on his feet, a large character on his palm, and a Dipper-shaped mark on his back. Devoted to books, he explored astronomy and divination. In adulthood, he wandered beyond the mundane world. Southward, he journeyed to Mount Heng, the Xiang River, and the Nine Doubts, seeking traces of the Southern Perfected. Westward, he reached Mount Emei and Western City, following the lofty footsteps of the Pure and Void.

At the end of the *Yuanjia* era of the Song, he sold medicines in the capital but declined Emperor Wen’s summons, returning instead to Mount Lu. In the third year of *Taishi* under Emperor Ming, Governor Wang Jingzong of Jiangzhou invited him to court. He was lodged in the rear hall, then summoned to an assembly at the *Yanxian* Pavilion in the Hua Lin Gardens, where all the nobles gathered. The Master, wearing a deer-hide cap, ascended to meet the emperor, who received him with solemn reverence. Thereupon, he was entrusted with the transmission of the Shangqing scriptures and methods of the Perfected Yang and Xu, as received by Ji Zhen.

Master Lu systematized the Three Caverns, becoming the age’s preeminent teacher. He then established the *Chongxu* Abbey on Mount Tianyin north of the capital, as a sanctuary for transmitting the scriptures. The following year, the emperor fell ill, and Lu conducted the Golden Register Rites in his quarters. One night, a yellow vapor like a jeweled canopy spread over the altar. The emperor, moved by a strange dream, soon recovered. In the fifth year of *Yuanhui*, on the first day of the first month, he suddenly prepared to return to his old mountain, startling his disciples. On the second day of the third month, he peacefully departed. His cap and shoes were sent off, and he was interred at the *Jianji* Abbey. Posthumously, he was styled *"Master of Simplicity and Tranquility"* and enfeoffed as *"Perfected of Cinnabar and Primordial Qi."*

**Daoist Sayings**
Dong Jing, styled Weinian, was of unknown provenance.

At first, he traveled to Luoyang with an official from Longxi, his hair unbound as he wandered, chanting and singing at leisure, often lodging in the White Society. Sun Chu, then serving as a court scholar, frequently visited him there for conversation. Years later, he vanished without a trace. At his resting place, only a stone bamboo and two poems remained. One read:

The Dao of Heaven is firm and simple,
The body of Earth, honest and dense.
Vast is the Great Simplicity—
This is the rule, this is the norm.
In the latter age, men rush and flee,
Replacing substance with mere form.
The world’s affairs stretch on and on—
Who knows their truth?
I will depart this realm of emptiness,
Returning to my chamber of the natural Way.

The other poem said:

Confucius met no fateful time,
And grieved when the lin appeared.
O lin, o lin—why not flee the world
To preserve your true nature?

**Daoist Sayings**

Shan Daokai was a man of Dunhuang. He always wore coarse hempen cloth, and though others gifted him silk robes, he never wore them. Unaffected by cold or heat, he remained indoors day and night. He regularly swallowed fine pebbles, sometimes several at once, consuming them once a day in varying amounts. Fond of dwelling in mountains, when mountain spirits appeared in strange forms to test him, he showed no fear. During the reign of Shi Jilong, he traveled from Xiping, covering a hundred *li* in a single day. Arriving in Qinzhou, he was sent to Ye by imperial decree. Jilong ordered Fotucheng to speak with him, but could not humble him. Fotucheng said, "This Daoist observes the rise and fall of states. If he leaves, great chaos will come." By the end of Jilong’s reign, Daokai crossed south to Xuchang, and Ye descended into turmoil.

In the third year of *Shengping*, he reached the capital, then journeyed to Nanhai and entered Luofu Mountain. There, he dwelled alone in a thatched hut, detached from worldly concerns. He died in his mountain abode at over a hundred years of age. His disciples placed him in a stone cave, but later moved him to a stone chamber. Yuan Hong of Chen Commandery, serving as governor of Nanhai, ascended to the mouth of the stone chamber on Luofu Mountain. There, he saw Daokai’s body as if still living, with incense and earthenware vessels still present. Sighing, he said, "The master’s conduct and deeds surpass all others—he must have shed his form like a cicada." He then composed a eulogy for him. **Southern History**

Zong Bing, styled Shaowen, was a native of Nanyang. After Emperor Wu of Song executed Liu Yi and assumed governorship of Jingzhou, he asked Yi’s former administrative advisor Shen Yong, "What measures should be taken today?" Yong replied, "Remove past grievances, double the bestowal of grace, honor the ranks of the virtuous, and prominently promote the capable—nothing more." The emperor accepted his counsel and summoned Bing to serve as his secretary. Bing declined. When asked why, he answered, "For over thirty years, I have drunk from the valley streams of Mount Bingqiu—how could I bow my waist to become a running errand-clerk?" The emperor approved his response and let the matter rest.

Bing was exquisitely skilled in zither, calligraphy, and painting, and profound in discourse on principle. Whenever he wandered among mountains and rivers, he would forget to return. His elder brother Zang, serving as governor of Nanping, pressed him to come home. Thereupon, Bing built a residence by the Three Lakes of Jiangling, where he lived in leisure, free from affairs. He was summoned to serve as a traveling aide to the Marshal of State, and the General of the Swift Cavalry, Dao Lian, appointed him as his secretary—both posts he declined. Prince Yiji of Hengyang, governing Kezhou, personally visited his chamber, feasted with him in joy, and appointed him as administrative advisor. Yet Bing never rose to take the post.

He loved landscapes and delighted in distant travel. He journeyed west to the Jing and Wu mountains, and south to Mount Heng. Later, illness compelled him to return to Jiangling, where he sighed, "Old age and sickness have both arrived—how can I hope to gaze upon all the famous mountains? I shall only still my heart and contemplate the Dao, roaming beyond the external world." Wherever he set foot, he painted the scenes upon his walls, saying to others, "When I strike the zither and move its strings, I wish to make all the mountains resound."

In ancient times, there was a piece for metal and stone instruments prized by the various Huans. When the Huan clan perished, its music vanished—only Bing transmitted it. Emperor Wen dispatched the musician Yang Huan to learn it from him. **Daoist and Confucian Accounts**

Shen Daoxian, a native of Wukang in Wuxing, was benevolent from youth and fond of the *Laozi* and *Book of Changes*. He dwelt in a refined hut at the foot of Stone Mountain north of the county, sharing a single pot and granary with his orphaned nephews and elder brothers’ sons, yet his impoverished circumstances never altered his integrity. He studied the zither under Dai Da, and Wang Jinghong held him in profound esteem. Though the province summoned him twelve times, he declined every appointment.

Once, a thief stole vegetables from his garden. Upon returning and seeing this, Shen concealed himself until the thief departed, only then emerging. Another time, someone uprooted a large bamboo shoot behind his house. He sent a servant to stop them, saying, "I cherish this shoot, wishing it to grow into a grove so we may share even finer ones later." He then sent for a large bamboo shoot to give them, but the thief, ashamed, refused it. Shen had it left at their door before returning.

Local youths gathered to study under him, though he often lacked food to sustain his disciples. Kong Yin, the magistrate of Wukang, generously supported them, enabling all his students to succeed. When Emperor Wen learned of this, he dispatched an envoy to inquire after him.

In his old age, Shen subsisted on vegetables, often without provisions for the day, yet he delighted in his zither and books, diligently studying without weariness. Upon his death, his son Huifeng carried on his work but declined the province’s summons. A Daoist recluse.

Liu Ningzhi, styled Yinan, was a native of Zhijiang in Nanjun. Admiring Lao Lai and Yan Ziling, he renounced his family wealth, building a house in the wilderness with his younger brother and elder brother’s son, subsisting only on what his own labor produced. The province and commandery esteemed his virtue and conduct, summoning him repeatedly, but he declined all appointments. Prince Yiqing of Linchuan and Prince Yiji of Hengyang both dispatched envoys to inquire after him. In his reply, Ningzhi prostrated himself and styled himself "your servant," omitting the customary rites of common folk. When some reproached him for this, he said: "Of old, Lao Lai addressed the King of Chu as 'your servant,' and Yan Ziling likewise maintained equal rank with Emperor Guangwu. Never did Chao Fu or Xu You deign to call Yao and Shun their lords."

At the time, Jingzhou suffered famine. Fearing Ningzhi might starve, Yiji sent him a gift of one hundred thousand coins. Overjoyed, Ningzhi took the money to the market gate and, seeing those with hungry faces, distributed it all among them—vanishing in an instant. Fond of mountains and rivers, he would daily take his wife and children to drift upon the lakes, settling in reclusion on the southern slopes of Mount Heng. There he climbed lofty peaks where no human tread remained, building a small hut to dwell in. Gathering herbs for ingestion, he spent his days thus until the end of his life. A Daoist recluse.

Chu Boyu, styled Yuanqu, was a native of Qiantang in Wu Commandery. From youth he held to reclusive principles and few desires. At eighteen, when his parents arranged his marriage and the bride entered through the front gate, Boyu departed through the back. He then went to reside on Mount Baibu in Kuaiji, enduring both cold and heat—contemporaries compared him to Wang Zhongdu. For over thirty years he remained there, utterly cut off from human society. When Wang Sengqian served as governor of Wu Commandery, he earnestly sought Boyu with ritual courtesy. Boyu, unable to refuse, stayed in the commandery for two nights, exchanged but a few words, and withdrew. Upon Emperor Gao’s accession, a personal edict ordered the commanderies of Wu and Kuaiji to welcome and escort him with full rites, but he again pleaded illness and declined. Unwilling to override his resolve, the emperor had the Taiping Lodge built for him on Mount Baishi in Kuaiji County. He died at eighty-six. Boyu had long dwelt in a single tower, and upon his death was interred in that very place. Kong Yue received Daoist teachings from him, and a stele was erected beside the lodge.

The Daoist-scholar Gu Huan, styled Jingyi and also Xuannian, was a native of Yanguan in Wu Commandery. At six or seven he could recite the Six Jia. Poor, his father sent him to the fields to scare birds; he composed the *Rhapsody on the Yellow Sparrow* and returned home. When his father saw that the sparrows had eaten over half the rice and prepared to beat him, he showed the rhapsody and was spared. In his village stood a schoolhouse; though too poor to enroll, Huan leaned against the wall behind it and listened without ever forgetting. At night he burned pine knots to read, or lit chaff to see by. As he grew older his resolve never flagged. Hearing that Shen Xuan of Wuxing in Dongqian could transmit the Five Classics’ texts and commentaries, he pretended to be a scribe and studied under him. In his twenties he further studied under Lei Cizong of Yuzhang, consulting on abstruse Confucian and Daoist doctrines. When his mother died, he took no water or grain for six or seven days and built a hut beside her grave. Thereafter he lived in reclusion, never serving in office. On Mount Tiantai in Kuaiji he opened a hall, gathered disciples, and taught—often nearly a hundred. Fond of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, he practiced ingesting herbs and elixirs. He did not associate with others; each morning when he stepped outside, mountain birds alighted on his palm to eat. He also mastered yin-yang texts and divination, with many proven results. In Baishi Village of Shanyin, where demonic illnesses often struck, villagers came to plead with Huan. He went to the village and lectured on the *Laozi*, and all the afflicted recovered. Another possessed man asked Huan, who inquired, “What books do you have at home?” The man replied, “Only the *Classic of Filial Piety*.” Huan said, “Take the *Zhongni* chapter, place it by the sick man’s pillow, and revere it—he will recover on his own.” The man did so and was cured. When asked the reason, Huan answered, “Good repels evil; rectitude overcomes perversity. That is why the illness abated.”

Kong Yue once climbed the ridge to seek Huan, and they discussed the Four Schools. Huan said, “The central principle is singular—how could there be two? The Four Schools lack correctness because they miss the center.” Thereupon he composed the *Treatise on Three Names* to rectify them. Though Huan spoke haltingly, he excelled in writing treatises. He also annotated Wang Bi’s *Book of Changes* in two scrolls, which scholars transmitted. After Emperor Gao of Qi assumed regency, Huan served as chief clerk of Yangzhou, but upon the emperor’s enthronement he returned, styling himself “Minister of the Mountains and Valleys.” He presented a *Political Outline* in one scroll; the emperor praised it in a rescript and sent him home with a dust whisk and plain zither. Sensing his end, he composed a poem to express his intent:

Five paths hold no permanent abode,
Three Pures have an eternal dwelling.
Essential qi follows heaven’s course,
Wandering souls transform with things.
Roc and peng journey to the great sea,
Cicada and dove to mulberry and jujube.
Attaining life, one leaves or stays as fate allows;
A good death equalizes day and night.
Entrusting life, where can one not ride?
What direction cannot be steered?
Aspiring heart seeks prior awakening,
Merging thus, I take my leave.

He set his own day of death and chose his burial time. He died on Mount Ke at sixty-four. His body remained fragrant and supple, for he had attained the immortal transformation of *shijie*. He was returned to his old grave, where twin-trunked trees grew beside it, and the county magistrate Jiang Shantu reported the marvel.

The Daoist-scholar Du Jingchan, styled Jingqi, was a native of Qiantang in Wu Commandery.

In his youth, he was serene and withdrawn, disdaining worldly office. He broadly studied literature and meaning, devoting himself to the cultivation of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. He formed a deep bond with Gu Huan of the same commandery, and together they established a school in the eastern mountains of Shining to teach disciples.

At the beginning of the Jianwu era, he was summoned to the position of Gentleman Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary. Jingchan said: *"Did Zhuangzi hold his fishing pole for the sake of a thatched cottage?"* In the end, he declined on grounds of illness and did not accept the post. He later died.

Daoist Zhi
Zong Ce, styled Jingwei, was the grandson of Zong Bing, a recluse of the Song. From youth, Ce was quiet and retiring, disliking social intercourse. He often sighed: *"A family’s poverty and parents’ age may drive one to take office without regard for rank—this the former sages praised as admirable. Yet I remain perplexed. Truly, I cannot summon gold from the earth or conjure carp from the river, but I can follow heaven’s Dao and partake of earth’s bounty. How could I consume another’s generous stipend and bear another’s weighty affairs?"*

The General of the Cavalry, Prince Yu of Yuzhang, summoned him to serve as a military aide. Ce replied to the summons: *"Why wound the seabirds in vain and fell the mountain trees with wanton axes?"* The prince sent another letter to request him. Ce answered: *"My nature is like that of scales and feathers, loving to dwell in mountains and valleys. I cherish the pines and clouds, lightly straying from the paths of men. Though I roam the cliffs and streams like one mad..."*

Suddenly unaware that old age had arrived, yet now his temples were already white—how could he feign emptiness while demanding substance, or constrain the fish and birds in their longing? Resolved to wander famous mountains, he copied onto his wall the *Portrait of Shang Ziping* by his ancestor Zong Bing.

His eldest son, Bin, held office in the capital. Learning of his father’s intent, he sought a stipend to return as Administrator of Nanjun. Ce then entrusted him with all family affairs. The Prefect, Prince Zijing of Anlu, and the Chief Clerk, Liu Yin, along with their subordinates, all presented him with parting gifts. Ce accepted nothing, keeping only the two books of Laozi and Zhuangzi at his side.

His children and grandchildren bowed in farewell, weeping bitterly. Ce let out a long whistle and did not look back. He then went to Mount Lu and dwelled in Zong Bing’s former residence.

When the Marquis of Yufu, Zi Xiang, became Governor of Jiangzhou, he sent generous gifts. Ce replied: *"From youth I have suffered a mad affliction, roaming mountains to gather herbs. Having come here from afar, I eat only what fills my belly, clothe myself in pine bark and creepers, and am content in simplicity. How could I accept such unsought bounty?"* Zi Xiang ordered his carriage prepared to visit him, but Ce avoided the meeting.

He associated only with like-minded men—Yu Yi, Liu Ci, his clansman Shangzhi, and others—with whom he came and went, discoursing and expounding.

In the second year of the Jianwu era, he was summoned to serve as Registrar of the Minister of Education but declined and passed away.

Ce was skilled in painting, having depicted himself meeting Ruan Ji at the outskirts of Xingguo, seated outside facing him. He was also fond of music and proficient in the *Book of Changes*, *Laozi*, the *Continuation of the Biographies of High-Minded Scholars* by Huangfu Mi, and the *Three Scrolls of the Biographies of Eminent Scholars*. He once composed the *Records of Mount Heng and Mount Lu*.

**Daoist and Confucian:**
Shen Linshi, styled Yunzhen, was a native of Wukang in Wuxing. From childhood, he was quick-witted; at seven, he listened to his uncle Yue discourse on abstruse matters and recalled every word without omission. Yue patted his shoulder and said, *"If this culture does not perish, it shall endure through you."*

As he grew, he mastered the classics and histories, harboring lofty aspirations. Living in seclusion in the countryside, he wove bamboo screens to support his impoverished family. Yet he recited books ceaselessly, earning the villagers’ nickname: *"The Screen-Weaving Scholar."* Well-versed in ritual traditions, he often instructed his fellow villagers. When urged to enter officialdom, he replied: *"Fish in a trap, beasts in a cage—all under heaven share the same bond. The sage’s profound resonance ensures every step is auspicious. Truly, I have yet to emulate the loftiest conduct or sit in oblivion. Why should I not aspire to daily diminution?"* He then composed the *Rhapsody on the Mysterious and Scattered* to renounce such ambitions.

He lectured on the classics, teaching dozens or even hundreds of disciples. Each built a dwelling beside his, prompting locals to say: *"In the hills of Wuxing lives a worthy man, who opens his doors to teach as if in the heart of the city."* His clansmen, the Director of the Bureau of Personnel Yuan and the Palace Gentleman of Writing Yue, jointly memorialized his righteous conduct. Summoned to serve as Gentleman for Writing, he declined. In a letter to Yue and others, he wrote: *"A name is but the guest of reality. My roots lie not in the center, and my heart remains empty of striving. Whether north or south, kindness becomes calamity—misfortune shall arise from this."*

Though past eighty, he continued transcribing texts by lamplight in fine script, producing two or three thousand scrolls. Contemporaries attributed this to his cultivation of stillness and silence. He composed the *Rhapsody on the Black Silkworm* to express his intent and annotated the *Two Systems of the Zhou Changes*, the *Inner Chapters of Zhuangzi*, the *Essentials of Laozi*, and dozens of other classics.

He died at home at eighty-five. In his final instructions, he followed Huangfu Xuanyan’s example: a copy of the *Classic of Filial Piety* was placed in his coffin, the grave dug two feet deep, no funerary platform erected, and offerings made with seasonal mats and plain wine. His son Yi carried out his wishes.

Lu Huixiao of Wu Commandery and Zhang Rong composed eulogies for him. Yan Zhenqing, Governor of Tang Prefecture, wrote the *Record of the Shen Clan’s Ancestral Virtues* and erected a stele beneath the ancestral tablet to honor his legacy. His tomb lies on Jine Mountain.

**Daoist in Essence:**
Yu Yi, styled Youjian, was a native of Xinye. His nature was serene, and he avoided worldly entanglements. When Wang Ying, Prince of Linchuan, governed the province and sent a gift of a hundred *hu* of wheat, Yi told the messenger: *"I wander with woodcutters and deer—my life clad in coarse hemp. Racing the sun and moon’s chariot, I preserve the fruits of my own labor. The prince’s grace is already profound."* He firmly declined the gift.

Devoted to literary refinement for his own delight, Yuan Xiang, Chief Clerk of Anxi, admired his character and presented him with a deer-antler book stand, a clamshell inkstone, and a white ivory brush, along with a poem that read:

*"The bright sun shines clear,
The blue heavens stretch vast.
Once we heard of Chao and Xu—
Now we behold Tai and Shang."*

Yi reciprocated with a twin-branch bamboo book stand. In the third year of the Jianwu reign, an imperial edict summoned him to serve as Registrar to the Minister of Works, but he declined and passed away.

**Daoist and Confucian in Harmony:**
Yu Chengxian, styled Zitong, was a native of Langling in Yingchuan. Profoundly composed and resolute, he never voiced judgments in speech, nor did joy or anger show on his face—none could fathom his depths. He mastered every arcane classic and secret text, attaining precision in the Nine Schools and Seven Summaries. He then traveled to Mount Heng with the Daoist Wang Sengzhen. The Loyal and Stalwart Prince of Poyang admired his demeanor and invited him to stay, commissioning him to lecture on the *Laozi*. Eminent scholars from near and far gathered to attend. Debates arose sharply, but Chengxian responded with measured elegance, offering insights they had never before encountered. In the third year of the Datong reign, Liu Huifei of Mount Lu arrived in Zhao Prefecture. Chengxian, who had prior ties with him, followed him to the gorges of Jing, where disciples assembled. At their request, he lectured on the *Laozi*. The Prince of Xiangdong personally drove to attend, and upon his return, the Prince of Mount Heng hosted a farewell banquet and presented him with poems.

**Daoist Virtues**

Tao Hongjing, styled Tongming, was a native of Moling. At the age of ten, he obtained Ge Hong’s *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* and, upon reading it, remarked to others: “To gaze upon azure clouds and behold the white sun—how distant it all seems!” His bearing was luminous and refined, his eyes bright and brows sparse, his frame slender, his forehead broad, his ears prominent, and on his right knee were several dozen dark moles. He inscribed the pattern of the Seven Stars, read over ten thousand volumes of books, and deemed it a deep shame to be ignorant of even a single matter. Skilled in the qin and chess, he was also accomplished in cursive and clerical scripts. Before reaching twenty, when Emperor Gao of Qi served as regent, he was summoned as an attendant reader. Appointed to court service, he frequently consulted the precedents of former masters. Though his family was poor, his request to serve as a county magistrate went unfulfilled.

In the tenth year of the Yongming reign, he removed his court robes and hung them at the Gate of Divine Martiality, submitting a memorial to resign his salary. An edict granted his request and bestowed upon him bolts of silk, along with a monthly provision of five *jin* of *fuling* and two *sheng* of white honey for his alchemical practice. When he departed, officials and nobles gathered at the Pavilion of the Conquered Tiger to bid him farewell, all remarking, “Since the Song and Qi dynasties, there has been no such precedent.” Thereafter, he settled on Mount Juqu in Jurong, where he established a retreat in the mountains, styling himself “Hua Yang” and living as a recluse. From then on, “reclusion” became synonymous with his name.

He first studied talismanic charts and scriptural methods under Sun Youyue of Dongyang, then traversed the renowned mountains of Jiangzuo, seeking the traces of Yang [Xi] and Xu [Mi]. He once told his disciples: “I see vermilion gates and spacious halls—though I recognize their splendor and pleasure, I feel no desire to go there. But when I gaze upon towering cliffs and vast marshes, I know these are difficult to establish oneself in, yet I constantly wish to dwell there.” Moreover, during the Yongming era, his attempts to secure an official salary repeatedly met with misfortune. “Had it not been so,” he said, “how could I have come to this present state?”

Master Hongjing was a man of adaptability and humility, his conduct in accord with the unseen. His mind was like a bright mirror, perceiving things as they arose. His words were never convoluted, and if they ever were, he would immediately recognize it. In the early Yongyuan era, he built a three-story pavilion, where his disciples and guests resided below, while he cut himself off from the world above. He had a particular fondness for the sound of wind in the pines, delighting in its resonance. Sometimes, when he wandered alone among springs and ridges, those who glimpsed him took him for an immortal.

By nature, he loved writing and prized the extraordinary, being especially versed in yin-yang and the Five Phases, divination by wind and stars, geography of mountains and rivers, local products, medicine, and materia medica. He once constructed a celestial sphere several *chi* in height, with the earth at its center. The heavens rotated while the earth remained still, and through a mechanism, all movements aligned with the heavens—he called it a tool for Daoist cultivation. He deeply admired Zhang Liang, saying, “No ancient worthy compares to him.”

At the end of the Qi dynasty, he composed a prophecy: “Water cuts wood to form a bridge.” When Emperor Wu of Liang’s forces reached Xin City, Hongjing sent his disciple Dai Mengzhi to present a memorial under the pretext of seeking passage. Upon hearing discussions of abdication, he had his disciples compile several prophetic texts, all of which formed the character for “Liang.” He then instructed them to present these to the emperor. Since the emperor had long been acquainted with him, upon ascending the throne, he treated Hongjing with even greater favor. Having already obtained divine talismans and secret formulas, Hongjing repeatedly refined elixirs and reported their success. The emperor frequently provided medicinal ingredients, and when Hongjing ingested the flying elixir he had concocted, its efficacy was proven, deepening the emperor’s respect. Whenever he received Hongjing’s memorials, he would burn incense and receive them reverently.

The emperor tasked him with creating a calendar extending to the *jisi* year, which in fact corresponded to the third year of Taiqing. The emperor personally beckoned him and bestowed upon him a deer-skin cap. In response, Hongjing drew two oxen: one roaming freely among water and grass, the other fitted with a golden halter, led by a man holding a rope and driving it with a staff. The emperor laughed and said, “This man spares no effort—even wishing to teach a turtle to drag its tail. How could such a thing be achieved?” On matters of state, the emperor consulted him beforehand without exception. Letters arrived from the court several times a month, and contemporaries called him the “Prime Minister in the Mountains.”

In the fourth year of the Tianjian reign, he moved to Jijin Dongxuan to cultivate the supreme Dao, having lived in seclusion for over forty years. Though he was over eighty, his appearance remained vigorous. As the *Scriptures of the Immortals* say, “Those with square eyes live a thousand years.” In his later years, one of Hongjing’s eyes would occasionally appear square. Having mastered the arts of divination, he foresaw the fall of the Liang dynasty. He composed a poem in advance:

> “Yifu was careless and dissolute,
> Pingshu sat discoursing on emptiness.
> How could the Hall of Zhaoyang
> Be transformed into the palace of the Chanyu?”

He kept the poem hidden in a basket, and when he departed this world, his disciples gradually revealed it. By the late Tai tong era, scholars competed in discussing metaphysical principles and neglected martial affairs—just as Hongjing had foreseen, when Hou Jing usurped the throne, it occurred in the Hall of Zhaoyang. He predicted the day of his departure in advance and composed a farewell poem.

He passed away in the second year of the Datong reign at the age of eighty-one. He was posthumously granted the title *Zhongsan Dafu* and the posthumous name *Master Zhenbai*. His writings, including *Mountain and World Books*, numbered several hundred volumes, and over three thousand disciples received his teachings. His nephew Xu compiled the *Record of Master Tao of Hua Yang’s Reclusion*, while Xie Cen of Wuxing wrote the *Brief Biography of Master Tao*, Li Bo authored the *Biography of Master Tao of Mount Mao in the Liang Dynasty*, and Jia Song composed the *Inner Biography of the Perfected Master Tao, Supervisor of the Waters of Penglai*.

In the Xuanhe era, an imperial edict was issued conferring upon him the title *Perfected Master of the Teaching, Zong Yuanxu*, with the following decree:

> “I have received the radiant mandate of the Jade Empyrean and hold the sacred talismans of the Dragon Han. Thus, I shall propagate the numinous teachings and exalt the transformation of the Dao. I shall elucidate the subtle words of the supreme teaching and offer auspicious blessings to the ranks of the Perfected. Tao Hongjing, Supervisor of the Waters of Penglai, left behind traces of glory, feared the dissipation of his essence, shunned worldly entanglements, and though he dwelt in the mountains, his sincerity resonated with our long-standing bond. Having already attained immortality upon the seas, his virtue and name defy comparison. How could I dare forget his wondrous influence? Therefore, I bestow upon him the honor of a grand title, that he may forever partake in the blessings of life.”

*Records of the Perfected, Volume Three* concludes.
*Records of the Perfected, Volume Four* begins.

**Daoist Lineages**

**Zhou Ziliang**, styled Yuanhe, was a disciple of Tao Hongjing of Mount Mao. Originally from Runan County in Yuzhou, he later resided in Qinghua Ward, west of Jiankang in Danyang. His grandfather, Wenlang, was born of the Left Regular Attendant of the Prince of Jiangxia under the Liu-Song; his father, Yaozong, the fifth son of Wenlang, served as a local official but died young. His stepfather, Yaoxu, was a clerk in the Yangzhou administration. His mother, Zhenguang of Yongjia, dreamed during her fifth month of pregnancy that immortals and sages arose from all directions to approach her. On the second day of the first month in the *dingsi* year of the Jianwu reign (497), at the hour of *rending*, she gave birth. At ten, he followed his mother back to Yongjia. In the seventh year of the Tianjian reign (516), Tao Hongjing journeyed to the seas and mountains to seek transcendent instruction. When he rested at the oratory of the Celestial Master in Yongjia, Ziliang, then twelve, was already lodging within the precinct. He begged to enter the mountains as a novice, whereupon he first received *Records of the Immortals*, the *Five Thousand Words of Laozi*, and the *Talisman of the Lord of the Western Marchmount for Binding Tigers and Leopards*. Thenceforth, he devoted himself to tending incense and lamps. Though fond of calligraphy and painting, he could recite any text he had once perused.

Later, he accompanied his master to Mount Nanhuo and back to Muliu. In the eleventh year (520), he returned to Mount Mao, where he was further initiated into the *Charts of the Five Marchmounts* and the *Inner Writ of the Three Sovereigns*. In the autumn of his twelfth year, his maternal relatives came to reside in the mountains, so he moved out to dwell in a separate abode on the western slope. There, Ziliang secretly received numinous decrees and communed with immortals, yet Tao Hongjing never doubted him. On the twenty-third day of the fifth month in the *yiwei* year (525), the summer solstice, he suddenly fell into a trance that enveloped him entirely. After a long while, he awoke—this marked the beginning of his spiritual encounters. On the twenty-seventh day of the tenth month of the same year, at dusk, he underwent *shijie* (liberation by means of a simulated corpse) at the age of twenty.

Tao Hongjing arranged his belongings but left no final testament. On the dawn of the *jiazi* day of the eleventh month, he went to Yan’kou Cave and indeed found a large sealed case. Climbing the perilous cliffs to retrieve it, he brought it back and opened it, discovering the very decrees Ziliang had received. The case contained scattered and crumpled papers, which Tao Hongjing ordered by date and compiled into the *Records of Zhou’s Communications with the Unseen* in four fascicles. He also composed the *Biography of Zhou the Transcendent* as a preface and presented the work to Emperor Wu. Ziliang had cultivated the Dao across three lifetimes: first as Zhou Dajia, then as Liu Wei. The merit of his diligent practice in past lives flowed into his present existence, having thrice been recorded in the registers of immortality. Yet he had occasionally violated precepts and fallen from grace, enduring cycles of life and death before finally securing a place in the Bureau of Life Preservation. His name was changed to Taixuan, styled Xuling, and he was appointed Scribe of the Registers. Later, he was further commissioned as Director of the Morning Audience in the Eastern Flowery Realm, and his name was inscribed on tablets of purple jade. The teachings and decrees of the host of immortals are fully recorded in his *Records*.

**Daoist Arts**

**Sun Wentao**, also named Tao, styled Wencang, was a native of Kexian in Kuaiji. He entered Mount Mao to study under Tao Hongjing and received the true methods. Upon seeing the original scriptures handwritten by the Three Perfected of Yang and Xu, he began to copy them and soon achieved great skill. Later, he studied the calligraphy of Wang Xizhi and attained profound mastery, earning contemporary acclaim. The stele inscription for the *Nine Bestowments of the Southern Grotto of Huayang* and the stele at the former oratory of Director Xu were both in his hand. The inscription on the reverse of the *Southern Grotto Stele* reads: “Wentao’s heart was gentle yet resolute, his conduct upright and his wisdom all-encompassing. As his deeds transcended the common, he was honored with an exceptional inscription.” Such exceptional inscriptions have since vanished from the mountain.

**Daoist and Confucian Synthesis**

**Ma Shu**, styled Yaoli, was a native of Fufeng. He mastered the classics and histories, with particular expertise in the *Zhouyi* and the *Laozi*. When Shao Ling, Prince of Shaoling, served as Governor of Southern Xuzhou, he appointed Shu as a scholar-in-residence. During the Hou Jing Rebellion, the prince raised troops to aid the imperial court but left behind a library of twenty thousand scrolls, entrusting them to Shu. Shu immersed himself in reading until, overwhelmed, he sighed: “I have heard that those who covet rank and title regard Chao Fu and Xu You as mere gateposts, while those who cherish mountains and forests see Yi Yin and Lü Shang as mere mats. If one binds name and reality, even Dongmen Wu’s lofty reclusion beneath the gate-tower seems trivial. If one embraces purity and emptiness, even the chaff and husks of recluse discourse seem profound. Upon careful reflection, each follows his own inclination. Yet those who seek their true calling today falter at the mere sight of the path—has Heaven not favored the noble and lofty? Why is it that the mountains and forests have become so utterly obscure?”

Thereupon, he retired to Mount Mao with the resolve to remain there for life. Shu had endured the chaos of war from a young age, yet wherever he dwelt, bandits never intruded, and hundreds of households sought refuge with him. In the first year of the Yuangai reign (560), Emperor Wen of Chen summoned him to serve as Minister of Revenue, but he declined. In his later years, his eyesight became so keen that he could see objects within the void. A pair of white swallows nested in the trees of his courtyard, growing so tame that they would perch upon his desk. They came in spring and departed in autumn, continuing this pattern for nearly thirty years.

In the thirteenth year of the Daye reign (617), he passed away. His work, *On the Awakening of the Dao*, circulated in the world.

**Daoist Virtues**
Xue Biaozhi, a native of Jinling, shunned worldly company from youth and coveted neither rank nor wealth. In the second year of the Jianwu reign of the Qi dynasty (495), he sojourned in the Eastern Mountains to seek out the true and arcane, returning only in the third year. He initiated his practice at the Dongling Grotto-Heaven Hall on the eastern ridge of Great Mao Peak in Juqu, where he subsisted on pine seeds and drank from mountain streams, enduring for many years. The hall had been the site where the Jin Perfected One, Ren Dun, attained the Dao; its altar and sacred tortoise remained, imbued with potent numinosity. Thus, the Master sought the ancient and the true, settling there in that very place.

**Daoist Arts**
Xu Ze, a native of Ke in Donghai, was serene and sparing of desire from childhood. He studied under Zhou Hongzheng, mastering the Three Mysteries and excelling in discourse, his reputation resounding throughout the capital. Ze sighed and said: "Fame is but the guest of reality—shall I be its guest?" Thereupon, he embraced the resolve to conceal his worth, took up his staff, and entered Mount Jinyun, where hundreds of disciples gathered around him. During the Taijian reign of the Chen dynasty (569–582), he was summoned to rest at the Zhi Zhen Abbey, but after a month, he departed for Mount Tiantai. There, he ceased taking grain to nourish his nature, sustaining himself on pine alone. Though the depths of winter brought bitter cold, he wore no silk or cotton. When he first dwelt on Mount Jinyun, the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One, Lord Xu, descended and said to him: "At eighty, you shall become the teacher of a king, and only then will you attain the Dao."

At the time, Prince Guang of Jin governed Yangzhou. Hearing of Ze’s renown, he summoned him in his own hand. Ze said to his disciples: "This year, I turn eighty-one. The prince comes to summon me—Lord Xu’s words are true and verified." He then went to the prince, who entreated him to transmit the Daoist arts, but Ze declined, citing the inauspiciousness of the hour. Later that night, he instructed his attendants to prepare incense and fire, as if for the usual morning rites. By the fifth watch, he had passed away. His limbs remained supple as in life, and after several weeks, his complexion showed no change. The prince dispatched envoys to escort his remains back to Tiantai for interment.

From Jiangdu to Tiantai, many on the road saw Ze walking on foot, saying: "I have been released to return to my old abode." He took his scriptures and Daoist implements and distributed them among his disciples, then ordered a room swept clean, saying: "If a guest arrives, receive them here." Thereafter, he crossed the stone bridge and departed, his whereabouts unknown. Moments later, his coffin arrived, and only then did they realize he had transformed through numinous power. He was eighty-two.

The prince, hearing of this, marveled all the more. He sent a painter to depict his likeness, and Liu Jing composed an encomium for it.

Zhang Xian initially served in the Later Zhou as Minister of Education and Grand Master, composing fifty-two essays on the *Laozi* and *Zhuangzi* under the title *Discussions on the Dao*, known as *Daoist Sayings*.

During the Tang, the Daoist adept Wang Yuanzhi was a native of Langye. His grandfather, Jingxian, served as Prefect of Jiangzhou under the Liang, his father, Tanxuan, as Prefect of Yangzhou under the Chen, and his mother was the daughter of Ding Chao, Director of the Bureau of Horse-Drawn Carriages. Once, while napping in daylight, she dreamed of a numinous phoenix alighting upon her, and thus conceived. She also heard a child’s cry from within her womb. The monk Shizhi told Tanxuan, "The son you bear shall become a patriarch of divine transcendents."

Yuanzhi was born in the second year of the Liang’s Datong era. From childhood, he was keen and intelligent, mastering a wide range of texts. He first studied under Master Zongdao, Zang Jin, then entered Mount Mao to inherit and cultivate the scriptures and methods of Tao Hongjing. The Chen ruler, hearing of his reputation, summoned him to the Chongyang Hall for discourse, where he was greatly praised. When Emperor Yang of the Sui served as Prince of Jin and governed Yangzhou, he dispatched his minister Liu Guyuan to successively summon Yuanzhi. Upon their meeting, Yuanzhi’s beard and hair suddenly turned white, startling the prince, who sent him away. Soon after, his appearance returned to normal.

When Emperor Yang visited Zhuo Commandery, the Gentleman of the Palace, Cui Feng, invited Yuanzhi to meet at the Linluo Palace. The emperor personally received him with the rites due a disciple, and ordered the construction of the Jade Purity Mystic Altar in the capital to house him. When the emperor later traveled to Yangzhou, Yuanzhi admonished him against leaving the capital, but the emperor did not heed his advice.

During the time when the future Emperor Gaozu of the Tang was still in obscurity, Yuanzhi secretly transmitted to him the talismanic mandate. In the Wude era, when Emperor Taizong pacified Wang Shichong, he and Fang Xuanling visited Yuanzhi in plain clothes. Yuanzhi greeted them, saying, "There is a sage among you. Are you not the Prince of Qin?" Taizong then revealed his true identity, and Yuanzhi said, "You shall become a sovereign of great peace. Take care of yourself." When Taizong ascended the throne and sought to bestow high office upon him, Yuanzhi firmly requested to return to the mountains.

In the ninth year of the Zhenguan era, Taizong ordered the establishment of the Taiping Abbey on Mount Mao in Runzhou, ordaining Daoist priests and sending an imperial edict that read: "Master, your conduct is unadorned and simple, your virtue and practice pure and profound. You have cast aside worldly distractions to embrace the mysteries of the Dao. You exhale the old and inhale the new, consuming fungi and herbs."

Pondering the myriad wonders beyond the Three Clarities, he turned back his graying hair beyond a hundred years. His Dao surpassed the achievements of former worthies, his reputation towered since antiquity. Had he not received the secret formulas at the Golden Altar and the arcane texts upon the Jade Summit, who could have attained this?

When We were still in the princely court, We early sought his teachings, and his long-cherished model has never faded from Our waking or dreaming thoughts. Recently, upon reading his memorial requesting to return to his former mountain, We have already issued separate orders. Not disregarding his lofty aspirations, We have permitted the establishment of an abbey to honor his lifelong devotion. Yet We know not when the Master will arrive. As for the buildings being constructed beyond the river, when will they be completed? We eagerly await the details to relieve Our longing. Recently, We have dispatched the Grand Astrologer Xue Yi and others to visit him and convey Our intentions.

On the fourteenth day of the eighth month of that year, he said to his disciple Pan Shizheng: "I have seen the celestial register. In my youth, I accidentally injured a boy’s lips, and thus cannot ascend to heaven in broad daylight. I have been appointed as the Lesser Chamber Earl. Soon I shall depart." On the sixteenth day, he bathed, donned his cap and robes, burned incense, and lay down. Turning to his attendants, he asked, "What time is it?" They replied, "The hour of Chen."

He said, "Good." Then he adjusted his cap and passed away, aged one hundred and twenty-six. In the second year of Tiaolu, he was posthumously appointed Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, with the honorific title *Master of Ascended Perfection*. When Empress Zetian ascended the throne, he was further posthumously promoted to Grand Master for Proper Consultation with Gold and Purple Insignia. In the second year of Tian Shou, his honorific was changed to *Master of Ascended Mystery*, and he was then known as the *Dharma Master Wang*.

The Daoist Xu Hongke was a Daoist from Mount Tai. During the Sui chaos, he sent a letter to Li Mi, saying: "The great assembly has long gathered, and I fear that when the rice is exhausted, the people will scatter. The troops are weary from prolonged war, making success difficult. You should seize the opportunity to advance, harness the momentum of your soldiers and horses, follow the river eastward, and march straight to Jiangdu. Seize the tyrant, issue commands to the realm, and order will be restored." Li Mi admired his words and sent a letter to summon him, but Hongke never emerged, and none knew his whereabouts.

Hu Jun of Zhi Hall remarked: "Hongke’s strategy was both extraordinary and upright. Not only was Li Mi incapable of such insight, but none among the Tang worthies could match it. The world has never lacked talent—some hide among butchers and peddlers, or even among bandits. Hongke, though at ease in his yellow Daoist cap, harbored plans to rectify the times and possessed the means to save the world, yet no one recognized this. Emperor Yang of Sui was without the Dao, and the people’s resentment was justified. The army’s rebellion was justified. The scholar-officials’ departure was justified. Yet as a Daoist, he could have wielded his body amidst mist and clouds, freeing himself from the dust and filth. The rise and fall of rulers, the order and chaos of the realm—what concern were these to him? Yet he spoke with fervor, grasped the essentials, urged others to adopt his strategy, and advocated seizing the tyrant outright. As the *Book of Songs* says: *Men hold fast to constancy, loving this excellent virtue.* This is precisely what it describes. However, Li Mi was unworthy of such counsel, and Hongke, perhaps, did not fully comprehend this."

When the armies rose at Jinyang, some had no path to make themselves known and thus casually voiced their thoughts through Lord Pu. From this single remark, one may glimpse the extraordinary qualities within his breast. Yet he never revealed himself—even when Taizong gained the realm, no word of him was ever heard. Had he already died? Or was he perhaps of the same ilk as Huang Shigong or Lu Zhonglian? Alas, he may well be called a lofty scholar.

**Daoist Quan**
Wei Zheng, styled Xuanzheng, was a native of Qucheng in Weizhou. Orphaned young and adrift, he abandoned his family’s wealth and pursued no worldly affairs, harboring great ambitions. During the Sui chaos, he concealed himself as a Daoist. Later, he aided Taizong, admonishing him with forthright counsel to practice benevolence and righteousness. Thus was achieved the peace of the Zhenguan era, and he became a paragon of his age. The *Old唐书* does not record his biography in full.

**Daoist Wei**
Xue Yi was a native of Fenyin in Hedong. From youth, he delighted in profound discourse. During the Daye era, he left the secular world to become a Daoist and mastered astronomy and calendrical calculations. Emperor Yang summoned him to the inner sanctuary of Yuqing Abbey, repeatedly ordering him to perform rites and petitions. At the beginning of the Wude era, he was sent to serve the Prince of Qin. Yi once secretly told the prince: “The Virtue Star guards the fate of Qin; you shall possess the realm. I pray you cherish yourself.” He was later promoted to Grand Astrologer. During the Zhenguan era, when preparations were made to perform the Feng sacrifice at Mount Tai, a comet appeared. Yi, citing celestial omens, warned that the eastern journey might not yet be auspicious. When Chu Suiliang also voiced this concern, the plan was abandoned. Later, Yi submitted a memorial requesting to resume his life as a Daoist. Taizong established the Zifu Abbey on Mount Jiufeng for him, appointing him Gentleman of the Palace and Master of Zifu Abbey. There, Yi constructed a Qing Terrace to observe celestial phenomena, reporting any omens of disaster, eclipses, or celestial transgressions as they occurred. His memorials often aligned with those of Li Chunfeng of the Capital Observatory. Chunfeng, too, had been a Daoist in the Sui, known as the Yellow-Crowned Master, and made himself known through his writings.

**Daoist Yin**
Wang Ji, styled Wugong, was a native of Longmen in Jiangzhou. His nature was unconstrained, and he disliked formal courtesies. His elder brother, Tong, was a great Confucian scholar at the end of the Sui. Ji repeatedly passed examinations for filial piety, fraternal devotion, and incorruptibility, and was appointed Corrector of the Imperial Archives. Discontented, he sought the post of Magistrate of Liuhe but, fond of wine, proved unfit for office. As the realm descended into chaos, he resigned, sighing: “The net of Heaven is vast; where shall I find refuge?” He returned to his hometown, where he owned sixteen *qing* of fields.

At the river islet, there lived a recluse named Zhongchang Ziguang, who practiced dietary regimens to nurture his nature. Ji admired his purity and simplicity, moving nearby to be close to him, though Ziguang, afflicted with sores, never exchanged words with him. Once, they drank together in silence, their joy profound. Ji had several servants and maids cultivate millet, brewing wine in spring and autumn, raising crows, and planting medicinal herbs for his own use. He kept the *Zhouyi*, *Laozi*, and *Zhuangzi* by his bedside, rarely reading other books. When he wished to see his brother, he would cross the river to return home, fond of roaming the northern mountains and the eastern marshes, hence styling himself Master of the Eastern Marsh. Riding an ox, he would pass by taverns, sometimes lingering for days. At the beginning of the Wude era, he was retained as a court academician in the Chancellery by virtue of his former office, with a daily ration of three *sheng* of wine. When asked what pleasure he found in his post, he replied: “The fine brew alone is worth lingering for.” He died in the eighteenth year of the Zhenguan era.

**Daoist Virtues**
Ye Fashan, a native of Kujiang, came from a family of Daoists for three generations, all transmitting arts of divination and life-nurturing. From youth, he received talismans and registers, mastering the suppression and exorcism of spirits. During the Xianqing era, Emperor Gaozong, having heard of his reputation, summoned him to the capital and sought to bestow a noble rank, which he firmly declined. He was retained in the Inner Daoist Chapel with exceptional provisions. When Gaozong widely summoned alchemists to refine cinnabar and transmute base metals, Fashan memorialized that the elixir of gold was difficult to achieve, merely wasting resources and undermining governance. He requested to test their authenticity. The emperor approved, and Fashan exposed over ninety as frauds, leading to their dismissal.

Fashan served for fifty years across the reigns of Gaozong, Wu Zetian, and Zhongzong, frequently traveling among famous mountains and being summoned into the palace, where he was treated with utmost reverence and consulted on the Dao. When Emperor Ruizong ascended the throne, he commended Fashan’s unseen assistance, and in the second year of the Xiantian era, appointed him Minister of Ceremonies, enfeoffing him as Duke of Yue. He remained a Daoist as before, residing at Jinglong Abbey in the capital. His father, Huiming, was posthumously awarded the title of Grand Master for Splendid Happiness with Silver and Cyan, and Li Yong, Prefect of Shezhou, composed his epitaph. At the time, no one rivaled his honor and favor.

Fashan was born in the *bingzi* year of the Daye era of the Sui and died in the *gengzi* year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, living a total of one hundred and seven years. In the eighth year, an imperial edict proclaimed: “The late Daoist Ye Fashan, Minister of Ceremonies *ad personam* and Duke of Yue, possessed a nature of celestial purity and subtle profundity, his wondrous principles flowing with mysterious ease. He encompassed secret essentials and unfolded numinous marvels. Truly, his silent depths were unfathomable, his abstruse subtlety beyond measure.”

Yet his heart remained with the reed mat and wooden tablet, his traces mingled with the court’s ranks. He preserved the yellow cap without wielding the staff, wore the purple sash without pride of honor. Towering in solitary splendor, he moved with a chill purity, his own way. His victorious qi severed desire, his steadfast wind left no dust. His golden bones jutted outward, his pearl-like radiance shone within. Thus his body answered to the Median Immortals, his name ascended to the Upper Virtue.

In moments of respite from governance, We repeatedly inquired of the Supreme Dao. The Master expounded the methods of ordering the state, offering forthright counsel time and again. His plans bore subtle admonitions, his affairs brought vast benefit. We sighed that his resounding voice had not yet faded, grieved that his bodily release came so suddenly. Before his remains could be properly arrayed, he was swiftly claimed by the waters. In remembrance of past sorrows, We now extend this posthumous appointment, honoring his resting earth: let him be posthumously appointed Prefect of Yuezhou.

The Daoist adept Sun Simiao was a native of Huayuan in Jingzhao. At seven, he began his studies, reciting over a thousand words daily. In his youth, he excelled in discoursing on the *Zhuangzi*, *Laozi*, and the teachings of the Hundred Schools. When Du Gu Xin, Governor of Luozhou, saw him, he exclaimed: “This is a sagely youth! Only regret that his vessel is too great—too small a task would ill suit him.” During the reign of Emperor Xuan of Zhou, amid the many troubles of the imperial house, he withdrew to Mount Taibai. When Emperor Wen of Sui served as regent, he summoned Simiao to the post of Erudite of the National University, but Simiao pleaded illness and did not rise.

He once told a close associate: “After fifty years, a sage will emerge. I shall then assist him to succor the people.” When Emperor Taizong ascended the throne, he summoned Simiao to the capital. Marveling at his youthful countenance, the emperor said: “Now I know that those who possess the Dao are truly worthy of reverence. Yanmen and Guangcheng were no empty words.” When the court sought to bestow a noble rank upon him, Simiao firmly declined. In the fourth year of Xianqing, Emperor Gaozong appointed him Remonstrance Grand Master, but again he refused. In the first year of Shangyuan, pleading illness, he requested to return home. The emperor specially granted him a fine steed and the manor of Princess Boyang for his residence.

At the time, renowned scholars such as Zong Lingwen, Meng Shuo, and Lu Zhaolin treated him with the rites due a master. Once, when Simiao accompanied the emperor to the Jiucheng Palace, Zhaolin remained at his residence. There stood in the courtyard a sickly castor-oil tree, for which Zhaolin composed a rhapsody. His uncle remarked: “In the *guiyou* year, I lay ill in the official residence of Guangde Ward, Chang’an. An elder said it was once the manor of Princess Boyang, who died before marriage, and so her estate was abandoned. At that time, the recluse Sun Simiao dwelled there. Master Sun’s Dao harmonized past and present, his learning embraced the arts of calculation. In lofty discourse on the Orthodox Unity, he was the ancient Zhuang Zhou; in probing the non-dual, he was the modern Vimalakīrti. In predicting celestial cycles and measuring the cosmos, he was the equal of Luo Xiahong and Master Anqi.”

Zhaolin suffered from a chronic ailment that physicians could not cure, so he asked Simiao of the Dao. Simiao replied: “I have heard that one who speaks well of Heaven must verify it in Man, and one who speaks well of Man must root it in Heaven. Heaven has its four seasons and five phases, cold and heat alternating in succession. Its revolutions bring harmony as rain, fury as wind, congealment as frost and snow, and expansion as rainbows. These are the constant patterns of Heaven and Earth. Man has four limbs and five viscera, waking and sleeping, exhalation and inhalation, the ebb and flow of essence and qi. Flowing, they become constructive and defensive qi; manifesting, they become complexion and countenance; issuing forth, they become voice and sound. These are the constant patterns of Man. Yang employs form, Yin employs essence—this is what Heaven and Man share. When these patterns are lost, steaming produces heat, stagnation produces cold. Binding forms tumors, sinking forms abscesses. Rushing becomes panting, exhaustion becomes withering. Diagnosis appears on the face, changes move in the body. Extending this to Heaven and Earth, it is the same. The five planets wax and wane, stars and constellations move erratically, the sun and moon suffer eclipses, comets and meteors streak across the sky—these are the critical diagnoses of Heaven and Earth. Untimely cold and heat are the steaming and stagnation of Heaven and Earth. Rocks standing and earth heaving are the tumors of Heaven and Earth. Mountains collapsing and earth caving in are the abscesses of Heaven and Earth. Violent winds and torrential rains are the panting and exhaustion of Heaven and Earth. Rivers flooding and drying up are the withering of Heaven and Earth.

Good physicians guide with medicinal stones and save with acupuncture. Sages harmonize with supreme virtue and aid with human affairs. Thus the body may have curable illnesses, and Heaven and Earth may have avertable disasters.”

He also said: “The gallbladder should be great, the heart small; wisdom should be round, conduct square.” The *Book of Songs* says: “As if treading on thin ice, as if facing a deep abyss”—this describes a small heart. “Vigorous warriors, bulwarks of dukes and marquises”—this describes a great gallbladder. “Unmoved by profit, unburdened by righteousness”—this is square conduct. “Acting upon the first sign, not waiting the whole day”—this is round wisdom.

Further questioned on the essentials of nurturing life, he answered: “Heaven has its fullness and emptiness, man has his continuance and peril—without self-caution, one cannot cross over. Thus nurturing life must begin with knowing self-caution. Caution takes reverence as its root. Therefore, if scholars lack reverence, they neglect benevolence and righteousness; if farmers lack reverence, they abandon sowing and reaping; if artisans lack reverence, they disregard rules and measures; if merchants lack reverence, their goods do not prosper; if children lack reverence, they forget filial piety; if fathers lack reverence, they forsake kindness; if ministers lack reverence, their merits are not established; if rulers lack reverence, disorder is not governed. Hence, the highest revere the Dao, the next revere Heaven, the next revere things, the next revere others, and the next revere themselves. One who worries for oneself is not constrained by others; one who reveres oneself is not controlled by them. Caution in small matters prevents fear of great ones; vigilance in near matters prevents contempt for distant ones—thus are all human affairs completed.”

Sun Simiao himself said: “Born in the *xinyou* year of the Kaihuang era, I am now ninety-three.” Inquiring among his hometown folk, all claimed he was several hundred years old. People spoke of the Zhou and Qi dynasties, and he recounted events as if witnessing them firsthand. Comparing these accounts, he was surely no mere centenarian. Yet his sight and hearing remained unweakened, his spirit and countenance flourished—truly one of the wise and erudite immortals of antiquity. When Wei Zheng and others were commissioned to compile the histories of the Qi, Liang, Zhou, Chen, and Sui dynasties, fearing omissions, they repeatedly consulted him. Sun Simiao transmitted events orally as if he had seen them with his own eyes. The Grand Master of the Crown Prince’s Household, Lu Qiqing, in his youth asked about human relations. Sun Simiao said: “Fifty years hence, you will ascend to the rank of regional governor, and my grandson will serve as your subordinate—you may preserve yourself.” Later, Qiqing became Prefect of Xuzhou, and Sun Simiao’s grandson, Sun Pu, indeed served as Magistrate of Xiaoxian in Xuzhou. For when he first spoke to Qiqing, Pu had not yet been born, yet he foreknew the matter. All his extraordinary feats were of this kind. He passed away in the ninth year of Yongchun, leaving instructions for a simple burial, no burial objects, and sacrifices without animal offerings. Over a month later, his complexion remained unchanged; when his body was lifted into the coffin, it seemed as light as an empty robe—contemporaries marveled at this. He annotated the *Laozi* and *Zhuangzi*, compiled the *Thousand Gold Prescriptions* in thirty scrolls, and authored the *True Record of Nurturing Life*, *The Plain Book in the Pillow*, and *The Convergence of the Three Teachings*, each in one scroll—all circulated in his time.

Daoist Adept Zhou Yinyao, styled Xiyuan, dwelled on Baoshan in Dongting. He claimed descent from the Master of the Jiao Prefecture, and the mountain held his ancestral shrine. The villagers spoke of his lineage, saying that several generations had attained the Dao. Yinyao diligently practiced the art of refining form through the Great Yin, neither altering his breath by day or night, nor changing his garments for cold or heat. Though he ate nothing, his strength was great; though he drank, there was no leakage. During the Zhenguan era, he was summoned to the capital and lodged in the palace, where he was asked about the Dao of cultivating breath. He replied: “What I cultivate is the affair of a common man—its merit does not extend to others. A single beneficial word from an emperor brings blessings to the myriad regions; the efficacy of attaining the Dao is swifter than mine. What I humbly study is not a matter worthy of Your Majesty’s attention.” He earnestly sought to return to the mountains, and the emperor granted his wish.

Later, Li Deyu of Zhaohuang heard of his attainment and built the Chongyuan Sacred Ancestral Monastery during the Baoli era as a place for his support. The monastery stood before the South Grotto of Huayang on Juqu Mountain, and Linghu Chu wrote its record.

Daoist Recluse Tian Youyan was a native of Sanyuan in Jingzhao.

Initially appointed as a student of the Imperial Academy, he later resigned and returned home, wandering to Mount Taibai. Whenever he encountered forests and springs, he would linger, unable to depart once his heart found resonance. His mother and wife shared his aspiration for a life beyond the mundane, and together they roamed mountains and rivers. After more than twenty years, he entered Mount Ji and built a dwelling beside the shrine of Xu You, calling himself "Xu You’s Eastern Neighbor." During the Tiaolu era, Emperor Gaozong visited Mount Song and dispatched the Vice Director of the Imperial Secretariat, Xue Yuanchao, to inquire after his mother. Youyan emerged in mountain robes and a hempen cap to pay his respects. The emperor ordered attendants to support and stop him, saying: "Sir, you nurture the Dao in the mountains—have you been well of late?" Youyan replied: "Your servant has been nourished by springs and rocks, afflicted by mist and clouds. Now that I have encountered this sagely age, I may follow my inclinations freely." The emperor said: "That I have gained you today—how is it different from the Han obtaining the Four Hoary Ones?" Yuanchao added: "When Emperor Gao of Han sought to depose his heir and enthrone a lesser son, the Yellow and Qi only then emerged—how could it compare to Your Majesty’s reverence for recluses, personally inquiring after those dwelling in crags and caves?" The emperor was greatly pleased and had Youyan escorted to the temporary palace, providing transport for his entire household to the capital. There, he was appointed Academician of the Chongwen Hall and instructed to discourse with Liu Rengui, the Junior Tutor to the Crown Prince. Later, when the emperor planned to construct the Fengtian Palace and visit Mount Song, Youyan’s former residence stood beside the palace site. The emperor specially ordered it spared from demolition and personally inscribed a plaque for its gate, reading: *Residence of the Recluse Tian Youyan.*

Daoist Recluse Lu Hongyi, styled Haoran, was originally from Fanyang and later relocated his family to Luoyang.

In his youth, Lu Hongyi was learned and particularly skilled in seal script, clerical script, standard script, and chancery script. He secluded himself on Mount Song, and at the beginning of the Kaiyuan era, an emissary was dispatched with full ceremonial honors to summon him, yet he declined twice. In the fifth year, an imperial edict was issued:

*"With my humble virtue, I have undeservedly ascended the great throne. I have long regretted the decline of the profound Daoist wind and the failure of pure transformation to rise. I have often yearned for the remnant worthies, hoping to hear the teachings of the Supreme Sovereign. You, sir, embody the inner harmony that penetrates principle, delve deeply into the subtle, exhaust the Way of the Great One, and tread the virtue of the Mean. Your lofty integrity is sufficient to stand alongside the ancients. Thus, I have repeatedly issued summons, desiring to achieve good governance. Yet each time, you have offered excuses, refusing to come. For years, I have awaited you with an empty heart and outstretched neck. Though I admire the steadfast purity of the recluse, I have failed to fulfill the reverent command of the diligent father. Is it that the court’s purpose differs from your nature, or that you, indulging in mountain forests, cannot return? Ritual has its great principles, and the bond between ruler and minister must not be abandoned. Now, the capital is near—this is not difficult. I have prepared gifts of silk and have reiterated this decree. I trust you will reconsider and align your conduct with my wishes."*

Hongyi accepted the summons and, in the sixth year, arrived at the Eastern Capital to pay his respects. He did not bow before the chief minister. When a palace attendant was sent to inquire about this, he replied: *"I have heard Laozi say that ritual is but the thinning of loyalty and trust, insufficient to rely upon. How dare I, Lu Hongyi, present myself with anything less than loyalty and trust?"* The emperor then summoned him separately to an inner hall, bestowed wine and food upon him, and issued a decree:

*"Lu Hongyi has answered the summons and come, seeking the supreme Way. His presence harmonizes with the pure wind. Thus, I elevate this recluse to encourage the realm. He is specially appointed Remonstrance Grand Master."*

Hongyi firmly declined. Another decree followed:

*"In ancient times, Emperor Yao fully honored Xu You’s integrity, and the Great Yu heeded Bo Cheng’s loftiness. Thus, we know that even the Son of Heaven has those he does not treat as subjects, and the feudal lords have those they do not befriend. How great is the significance of this in its time! The recluse Lu Hongyi of Mount Song, dwelling in remote seclusion, has concentrated his spirit on the brush and inkstone. He hides away to pursue his aspirations and practices righteousness to realize his Way. Cloud-like, he reclines in the valleys and forests, having done so for many years. Is it not said: ‘When a recluse is elevated, the hearts of the world turn toward him’? Thus, I dispatched letters to the cliffs and caves, summoning him with full ceremonial honors, hoping he would offer counsel to aid governance. Yet he stands apart, unyielding and difficult to sway. He steadies himself to uphold his principles, purifies his heart to inspire the age, resolutely declines honor and favor, and strengthens customs without lowering his resolve. In preserving his person, he resembles the men of Kuaiji and Yanling, who cannot be named as inferior. Like Taiyuan’s Wang Ba, who ultimately returned home due to illness, he shall be released to return to his mountain as Remonstrance Grand Master. Annually, he shall be granted one hundred *shi* of rice and fifty bolts of silk to cover his medicinal needs. The prefecture and county shall escort him to his place of seclusion. If he becomes aware of the court’s successes or failures, he shall report them in full. Upon his return to the mountain, he was further bestowed with the attire of a recluse and a thatched cottage, the imperial favor exceptionally generous. Hongyi composed the *Ten Records of the Thatched Cottage*, which admirers prized and transmitted."*

The Daoist scholar Bai Lǚzhong, a native of Junyi in Chenliu, was widely versed in literature and history. He once secluded himself in the ancient city of Daliang, where people called him "Master of Liang Hill." During the Jingyun era, he was summoned and appointed Collator of Texts in the Palace Library but soon resigned his post. In the seventeenth year of the Kaiyuan era, Minister of Justice Wang Zhixi submitted a memorial recommending Lǚzhong, praising his secluded life of study, his steadfast integrity, and his possession of the ancients’ spirit, deeming him fit to serve as a Reader-in-Waiting in the imperial study. When summoned to the capital, Lǚzhong declined on grounds of old age and illness. An imperial edict declared:

*"The former Collator of Texts in the Palace Library, the scholar Bai Lǚzhong, excels in learning and embodies the Dao in his rustic retreat. He explores traces to perceive the subtle and hides away to fulfill his aspirations. Thus, I have drawn from the streams of Ji and Si, seeking him at the Gate of Yi. His pristine character is naturally lofty; the dark cap of office holds no allure. With staff in hand as twilight gathers, his eminence and rank should be enhanced. Let him receive the generous favor of this appointment, that it may complement the honor due to the worthy. He may be appointed Gentleman for Court Service."*

Lǚzhong soon submitted a memorial requesting to return home. A handwritten imperial decree responded:

*"Filial piety and fraternal duty form the foundation of conduct; quiet retreat and withdrawal inspire the age. Having passed the age of seventy, you remain unstained by worldly dust. Your great virtue is known, and thus I confer this rank. Is this merely to honor the hidden in mountains and marshes? Truly, it is to reward and encourage human relations. Proceed to the capital, then return to your native place at your leisure."*

He remained for several months before departing. He authored *A Precise Discourse on the Three Mysteries* in one volume, annotated the *Laozi* and the *Huangting Neijing Jing*, and compiled a literary collection in ten volumes.

The Daoist adept Pan Shizheng, styled Zizhen, was a native of Zongcheng in Beiqiu. Having lost his mother in youth, he built a hut beside her grave and was renowned for his filial piety. During the Daye era, he was ordained as a Daoist priest and became a disciple of Master Wang Fazhu, who transmitted to him all the esoteric secrets, talismans, and registers of the Daoist tradition. Shizheng was pure and tranquil, free of desires. He dwelled in the Xiaoyaogu Valley of Mount Song for over twenty years, subsisting solely on pine needles, water, and *qingta* rice. When Emperor Gaozong visited the Eastern Capital, he came to the valley and saw Shizheng living alone in simplicity, seated on a rattan couch overgrown with creeping fig, nearly rotted away. Moved, the emperor asked: *"What do you need in these mountains?"* Shizheng replied: *"I need only flourishing pines and clear springs, which this mountain lacks not."* The emperor then commanded him to produce talismanic writings, but he declined: *"I do not know talismanic writing."* The emperor and empress were struck by his uniqueness and departed. The next day, they sent carriages to bring him to the temporary palace. They conversed with him at length, staying two nights before returning. Soon after, the emperor ordered the construction of the Chongtang Abbey at his residence and established a separate Hall of Refined Contemplation on the ridge to accommodate him. Later, the abbey was expanded into the Fengtian Palace. The emperor further ordered a special gate built at the mouth of Xiaoyaogu Valley, naming it "Gate of Immortal Wanderings." Another gate, the "Gate of Seeking the True," was erected on the northern side of the imperial park, both named in Shizheng’s honor. Each time the emperor summoned him by palanquin, the Court of Imperial Sacrifices presented newly composed music, which the emperor named *Splitting the Immortals*, *Gazing at the Immortals*, and *Longing for the Immortals*. He bestowed dozens of poems upon Shizheng, showing him the highest respect and favor.

In the first year of Yongchun, as his end approached, he said to his disciples: "I have silently lingered here, yet still troubled the worldly lord and disturbed the sacred mountains—truly, I am a sinner. You who study the Dao must never weary of delving into its mysteries."

He passed at the age of ninety-eight. The emperor and empress dowager mourned him without end, posthumously honoring him as Grand Master for Proper Consultation and bestowing the posthumous title *Master of Embodied Mystery*. A decree ordered Minister of Merit Wang Shi to compose his epitaph.

As for the Daoist arts—Liu Daohe, a native of Wanqiu in Chenzhou, initially dwelled in reclusion on Mount Song with Master Pan. When Emperor Gaozong learned of his reputation, he commanded the establishment of the Taiyi Abbey at his hermitage to serve as his residence and frequently summoned him to the palace. As the emperor prepared to perform the Feng Shan sacrifices, prolonged rains persisted, so he ordered Liu to perform the ritual to halt the rain in the Yiluan Hall. Soon after, the skies cleared. Greatly pleased, the emperor immediately dispatched him by imperial relay to ascend Mount Tai first and pray for blessings. All gifts bestowed upon him were distributed to the poor and needy.

Gaozong once commanded him to compound the elixir of return. When the elixir was completed, Liu presented it to the throne. He passed during the Xianheng era. Later, when the emperor constructed the Fengtian Palace, Liu’s burial chamber was relocated. His disciples opened the coffin to change his garments and rebury him, but his body was naught but hollow skin, its back split open like a cicada’s molt, all teeth and bones gone. The assembly declared it a case of *shijie*—liberation through apparent death. Upon hearing this, Gaozong sighed, "Master Liu compounded the elixir for Us, yet he himself consumed it to ascend as an immortal." The elixir he had presented, however, showed no extraordinary effects.

*Daoist Hagiographies*

Sima Ziwei, also named Chengzhen, styled Ziwei, was a native of Wen in Henei. He was a descendant of the Duke of Langye, who had served as Prefect of Jinzhou during the Zhou dynasty. From youth, he was fond of learning but disdained officialdom, and so became a Daoist, studying under Master Pan Shizheng. He inherited from him talismanic registers, as well as the arts of grain avoidance, *daoyin* (guiding and pulling), and elixir ingestion. Master Shizheng held him in particular esteem, saying, "From Tao Hongjing, I received the Orthodox Unity teachings, and now to you, the fourth generation, they are transmitted."

Ziwei once wandered among famous mountains and eventually settled on Mount Tiantai. Empress Wu Zetian, having heard of his reputation, summoned him to the capital. She personally praised him with her own hand, and upon his departure, ordered Li Jiao, Director of the Imperial Library, to host a farewell banquet for him at the eastern side of the Luo Bridge. In the second year of the Jingyun era, Emperor Ruizong dispatched his elder brother Chengwei to Mount Tiantai to welcome him to the capital. Upon entering the palace, the emperor first inquired about the arts of yin-yang and divination. Ziwei replied, "The *Daodejing* states that in cultivating the Dao, one daily diminishes, diminishing further and further until one reaches non-action. Moreover, what the heart and eyes know and perceive—even this must be diminished before it can be relinquished. How then could one pursue heterodox arts and increase one’s cunning and schemes?"

The emperor said, "To govern the body with non-action is to attain purity and loftiness, but how does one govern the state with non-action?"

Ziwei replied, "The state is like the body. *Laozi* says: let the mind wander in stillness, blend the *qi* in tranquility, follow the natural course of things, and be without selfishness—thus is the world governed. The *Book of Changes* states: the sage harmonizes with heaven and earth, and his virtue is to know heaven. He is trusted without speaking, succeeds without acting. The principle of non-action is the way to govern the state."

The emperor sighed and said, "These are indeed the words of Guangchengzi."

Ziwei firmly declined to remain and returned to the mountains. The emperor bestowed upon him a precious zither and a robe woven with cloud patterns, and sent him off. Court scholars composed poems in his honor, with Li Kuo leading the verses and over three hundred others joining in, titling the collection *Record of White Clouds*. Lu Zangyong, pointing to Mount Zhongnan, said to Ziwei, "That place is also excellent. Why must you go to Mount Tiantai?"

Ziwei replied, "In my view, it is the shortcut to officialdom."

Lu Zangyong flushed with embarrassment, for he had once hidden himself on Mount Zhongnan.

In the ninth year of the Kaiyuan era, Emperor Xuanzong sent envoys to welcome Ziwei to the capital. The emperor personally received the registers of the Dao, and bestowed upon him lavish gifts both before and after. In the tenth year, as the emperor returned to the western capital, Ziwei again requested to return to Mount Tiantai, and Xuanzong composed a poem to see him off. In the fifteenth year, he was summoned once more to the capital and was granted permission to select a scenic site on Mount Wangwu, where an altar chamber was built for his residence.

Ziwei then memorialized the throne, stating that the Five Sacred Peaks and their grotto-heavens each had an Upper Clarity Perfected One appointed to oversee them, governing the mountains, rivers, wind, rain, yin-yang, and the sequence of *qi*. Their regalia, vestments, retinues, and divine attendants all had designated names and numbers. He further requested the establishment of ritual halls to distinguish the spirits of the mountains and forests.

Xuanzong approved his proposal and ordered the construction of a Perfected Lord’s shrine at each of the Five Peaks, with their images and systems of worship devised in accordance with Daoist scriptures. Ziwei was skilled in seal and clerical scripts, and Xuanzong commanded him to transcribe the *Laozi* in three scripts. He then collated and corrected the text, fixing the authentic version at five thousand three hundred and eighty characters, which he presented to the throne. The emperor named his residence the Yangtai Abbey and personally inscribed its plaque. Three hundred bolts of silk were bestowed to cover the costs of medicines and elixirs.

At the age of eighty-nine, Ziwei passed away on Mount Wangwu. His disciples reported that on the day of his departure, a pair of cranes circled above the altar, and white clouds surged forth from the altar, rising to connect with the heavens. Yet his countenance remained as in life. Xuanzong deeply lamented his passing and issued an edict, saying:

"Sima Ziwei’s heart adhered to the Dao and prevailed; his understanding penetrated the profound and distant. He wandered among famous mountains, secretly harmonizing with the immortal grottoes. In life, he contemplated the wondrous, roaming in the realm of carefree attainment. In death, he returned to the root, resting in the boundless. Thus, his name was inscribed in the registers of the Perfected, his rank among the spirit officials. Though the forests and valleys remain unchanged, the distant skies are now empty. Thinking of his noble deeds, we are moved with sorrow. Let him be posthumously honored to illuminate the cinnabar registers. He is hereby granted the title of Grand Master for Splendid Happiness with Silver and Cyan, and a stipend of one thousand households. A stele shall be erected with an inscription composed by Our hand, and Wei Qumou shall write his biography."

Daohua—Wu Jun, styled Zhenjie, was a native of Huayin County in Huazhou. From youth, he was well-versed in the classics and skilled in composition. He sat for the imperial examinations but did not pass. His nature was lofty and pure, and he could not endure the vulgar customs of the world.

He entered Mount Song and became a Daoist under Master Pan, receiving the Orthodox Unity teachings. Through diligent study and reverent inquiry, he mastered their arts in full.

During the Kaiyuan era, he journeyed south to Jinling, then sought the Dao on Mount Mao, and after a time traveled to Tiantai to gaze upon the vast sea, delighting in the company of renowned scholars. His writings circulated in the capital, and when Emperor Xuanzong heard of his name, he dispatched an envoy to summon him. Upon arrival, Wu Jun was received in the Great Harmony Hall, where their conversation brought great pleasure to the emperor, who then appointed him as a Hanlin Academician.

One day, the emperor inquired about Daoist arts. Wu Jun replied: "The essence of Daoist arts is found in nothing so much as the *Five Thousand Words*; all other florid writings are but a waste of paper and ink." When asked about the cultivation of immortals, he answered: "Such matters belong to the realm of rustics and require years of merit and practice—questions unsuited to an emperor."

In every discourse, Wu Jun expounded on the teachings of the *mingjiao* and worldly affairs, offering subtle admonitions. The emperor held him in high regard and bestowed upon him the title *Master of the Origin of the Dao*.

During the Tianbao era, as Li Linfu and Yang Guozhong wielded power, the moral fabric of the realm daily unraveled. Wu Jun persistently petitioned to return to Mount Song, but his requests were repeatedly denied. Finally, an imperial edict permitted him to establish a separate Daoist abbey at the mountain’s temple. Sensing the coming chaos, he sought to return to Mount Mao. Permission was granted.

Soon after, the Central Plains descended into turmoil, and bandits multiplied in the Jiang-Huai region. Wu Jun then confined his travels to Tiantai and the Kè region. There, he formed bonds of transcendent friendship with Li Bai and Kong Chaofu. His collected works, twenty *juan* in length, were prefaced by Quan Deyu, and his *Three Treatises on the Mysterious Principle* and *On the Attainability of Immortality* were praised by men of discernment.

Though Wu Jun enjoyed special favor in the Hanlin Academy, Gao Lishi, who favored Buddhism, often disparaged him before the emperor. Wu Jun thus resolutely sought to be released from court. Yet his arguments were profound and far-reaching, his prose radiant and luminous. Each composition he produced was eagerly copied and circulated. Even Li Bai’s lofty detachment and Du Fu’s majestic refinement—few could match both but Wu Jun.

Daoquan—Li Mi, styled Changyuan, originally dwelled in Guigu. At seven, he could compose essays. In the sixteenth year of the Kaiyuan era, he was summoned for an audience as a prodigy, and Zhang Jiuling, who held him in particular esteem, called him his "young friend." As he matured, he became broadly learned and skilled in the study of the *Yijing*. He often wandered among Mounts Song, Hua, and Zhongnan, yearning for the arts of immortal transcendence.

During the Tianbao era, he presented a memorial at court advocating the restoration of the Yellow Emperor’s Nine Tripods. The emperor, recalling his early brilliance, summoned him to lecture on the *Daodejing* with great mastery, and he was appointed a Hanlin Academician.

When Emperor Suzong ascended the throne at Lingwu, he sought out Li Mi, who arrived of his own accord. After their audience, Li Mi expounded on the successes and failures of the realm. The emperor was pleased and wished to appoint him to office, but Li Mi firmly declined, preferring to serve as an attendant and advisor, joining discussions of state affairs and accompanying the imperial retinue. The court whispered: "The one in yellow robes is a sage; the one in white is a mountain recluse." He was then granted the rank of *jinzi* and appointed Military Advisor to the Marshal, Prince Guangping.

The emperor once remarked: "You attended the Supreme Emperor, served as my teacher, and now judge military affairs for Prince Guangping—you are the pillar of Our father and son." Yet Cui Yuan and Li Fuguo, resentful of Li Mi’s intimacy with the emperor, grew envious. Fearing disaster, Li Mi requested to withdraw to Mount Heng. An edict granted him a stipend at the third rank, bestowed the robes of a recluse, and arranged for a residence on Mount Lu. Li Mi once gathered pine branches to shield his back, calling it "nurturing harmony." Later, he found one shaped like a dragon and presented it to the emperor, prompting imitations across the land.

When Emperor Daizong ascended, Li Mi was summoned to the Penglai Hall’s library. Initially, he abstained from meat, but an imperial edict compelled him to eat it. When Emperor Dezong was at Fengtian, Li Mi was summoned to the temporary court and appointed Left Auxiliary Cavalier Attendant. He began excavating a mountain to open a carriage road to Sanmen, facilitating grain transport, and for his labors was promoted to Minister of Rites.

In the third year, he became a Participant in the Deliberations of the Grand Council. The emperor once remarked in passing: "Lu Qi is incorruptible and outspoken, yet lacks learning and breadth. I govern by the ancient Way, yet all point to his treachery—I remained unaware." Li Mi replied: "That Your Majesty discerned Lu Qi’s evil and averted the disasters of the Jianzhong era, that Li Kui was sent to the barbarians and Yan Zhenqing to Xi Li—these harmed many of the old and virtuous. Moreover, Yang Yan was not put to death, but Lu Qi slandered and ruined him, while Guan Bo and Huai Guang were promoted for their merits, only to be driven to rebellion—this was deceiving Heaven."

The emperor said: "Your words are true, but the chaos of Jianzhong—did you not know of Sang Daomei’s prophecy? It was fate." Li Mi replied: "Fate pertains to what has already come to pass. The ruler and his ministers create fate; it should not be invoked. To speak of fate is to abandon reward for good and punishment for evil." The emperor said: "I shall no longer speak of fate." Soon after, Li Mi was appointed Academician of the Chongwen Hall and tasked with compiling the national history.

Li Mi petitioned to abolish the last day of the first lunar month and establish the first day of the second lunar month as the Zhonghe Festival. Thereupon, he bestowed upon the imperial relatives and high ministers a *chi*-long measuring rod called the "Cai Du," while officials presented agricultural treatises to emphasize the fundamental importance of farming. The emperor was pleased and decreed that, together with the Shangsi Festival and the Double Ninth Festival, these would become the Three Festival Days, all marked by the distribution of *fanqian* coins.

In the fourth year of the Yanhui era, on the eighth month, a solar eclipse occurred at Dongbi. Li Mi remarked, "Dongbi is the repository of maps and books; the great ministers shall face misfortune. As both chief minister and academician, I shall bear this." The following year, he indeed passed away.

Li Mi moved in and out of the imperial palace, serving four emperors. Though often envied by powerful courtiers, he repeatedly evaded harm through his wit. Moreover, he frequently offered bold counsel that awakened the sovereign, leaving his own mark on governance. The minister Liu Mi later praised him, saying that in the recovery of the two capitals, Li Mi’s strategies played the greatest role—his merits surpassing even those of Lu Zhonglian and Fan Li.

**Daoist Lineages**

**Li Hanguang**, a native of Jiangdu in Guangling, originally bore the surname Hong but changed it to avoid the taboo of Empress Wu Zetian’s name. His family had long been scholars, and his father, Xiaowei, known as Master Zhenyin, was well-versed in the arts of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. In the early Shenlong era, Hanguang, renowned for his pure conduct, was ordained as a Daoist priest and resided at Longxing Abbey. In the seventeenth year of the Kaiyuan era, he followed Sima Ziwei to Wangwu Mountain, where upon their first meeting, Ziwei exclaimed, "Truly, you possess the countenance of the Jade Pure!" He dwelled in Songyang for over twenty years. After Sima ascended as an immortal, Emperor Xuanzong summoned Hanguang to court. Conversing with him, the emperor sighed, "In seeing Hanguang, I know that Master Sima still abides in this world."

One day, the emperor inquired about the Golden Tripod. Hanguang replied, "The Lord of Dao and Virtue is public; the Lord of Light Ascent harbors private intentions. If one perceives only the private, the sage’s teachings are lost. To seek life through desires is like chasing the wind." Deeply impressed, Xuanzong invited him to reside at Yangtai Abbey. After more than a year, Hanguang claimed illness and petitioned to return to Maoshan, where he compiled and revised scriptures and precepts.

In the twelfth month of the fourth year of the Tianbao era, the emperor dispatched an emissary bearing an imperial edict and seal to summon him. Upon arrival, whenever the emperor wished to consult him, Hanguang would first purify himself through fasting and bathing, requesting to transmit the Daoist teachings. Citing illness, he again sought to return to the mountains. The emperor then specially restored the former residence of Yang and Xu at Ziyang Abbey for his use, composed a poem to see him off, and prohibited hunting, fishing, or the entry of those who consumed meat or blood within the mountain.

At the time, many original Daoist scriptures and authentic texts had scattered and been lost. By imperial decree, Hanguang searched for and recovered them, presenting the complete treasury of sacred texts to the throne before being summoned again. The mountain recluse Wang Yu requested Hanguang to transcribe in standard script the *Thirteen Scrolls of the Supreme Scripture* to fill the gaps, remarking, "To attain immortality, the handwritten transmission must continue unbroken through the generations."

On the eighteenth day of the third month in the seventh year, Emperor Xuanzong received the *Record of the Three Caverns* in the Datong Hall. He bowed from afar to his master and bestowed upon Hanguang the title *Master of Mystic Stillness*, along with a set of ritual robes to honor the teacher-disciple relationship. On the fourteenth day of the eleventh month in the fourth year of the Dali era, he departed this life while seated in meditation at the Ziyang Retreat, holding a tablet as if still alive. He was eighty-seven. Posthumously, he was granted the title *Left Mystic Grand Master*, and the *Stele Inscription* was composed by the *Grand Master for Proper Consultation*, Yan Zhenqing, and Liu Shi. Additionally, twenty-four imperial edicts from the Kaiyuan era were engraved on stone.

**Zhang Zhihe**, styled Zitong, was originally named Guiling and hailed from Jinhua in Dongyang. His father, Youchao, was fond of the Dao and well-versed in the works of Zhuangzi and Liezi. He authored *Xiangwang* and *Baimai* to support his arguments. His mother, Liu, dreamed of a maple growing from her abdomen before giving birth to Zhihe.

At sixteen, he excelled in the *Mingjing* examinations and presented a memorial to the throne. Emperor Suzong retained him as a *Daizhao* in the Hanlin Academy and appointed him *Recorder* of the Right Gold Bird Guard. After mourning his parents, he never returned to office, dwelling instead by rivers and lakes, calling himself the "Fisherman of Mist and Waves." He composed the *Twelve Scrolls of the Mystic Realist* and adopted the title as his name. He also wrote *Fifteen Chapters on the Great Changes*, comprising three hundred and sixty-five hexagrams.

His elder brother, Heling, the magistrate of Puyang, feared he would vanish into reclusion and built him a cottage east of Guiji. The roof was thatched with *Imperata*, the beams left unhewn, and the mats woven of leopard skin and broomcorn. There, he shut his door for a decade. Chen Shaoyou, the *Observation Commissioner* and *Censor-in-Chief* of eastern Zhejiang, visited and stayed the entire day. He memorialized the emperor to name Zhihe’s residence *Mystic Realist Lane* and the alley *Revolving Pavilion Alley*. He also constructed a bridge to reach his dwelling, which passersby called *Grand Master’s Bridge*. Zhihe composed *Acknowledgments for the Grand Master’s Bridge* to express his gratitude.

Carrying a staff of *Viburnum* and a *Zhi*-wood cane, he wandered wherever inclination led. He fished without bait, unconcerned with catching fish. Emperor Suzong once bestowed upon him a male and female servant, whom Zhihe paired as husband and wife, naming the man *Fish Lad* and the woman *Wood Gatherer*. When asked why, he instructed *Fish Lad* to hold the fishing rod and coil the line in the reeds while beating the oar, and *Wood Gatherer* to gather orchid and cassia for firewood and bamboo for brewing tea.

Lu Yu, the *Collator* of Jingling, and Pei Xiu, a *Secretarial Court Gentleman*, inquired, "Who comes and goes with you?" Zhihe replied, "The Great Void is our dwelling, and the bright moon our lamp. I have never parted from the lords of the four seas—what need is there for coming or going?"

When Yan Zhenqing served as prefect of Wuxing, Zhihe paid him a visit. Observing that Zhenqing’s small boat was worn out, he offered to replace it. Zhihe said, "If you would grant me a fishing boat, I would gladly make it my floating home, drifting along rivers and lakes, coming and going at will—this would be this rustic’s greatest fortune." His wit and eloquence were all of this kind.

He loved to paint landscapes. When drunk, he might drum, play the flute, or dance with his brush, splashing ink to create paintings in rhythm. Emperor Xianzong sought his *Fisherman’s Song* for the imperial collection but could not obtain it. For the censor Li E, he painted a screen, transforming it with a thousand variations that left viewers astonished. Over sixty guests inscribed their names and titles beneath the painting. Zhihe summarized each with two words, all forming apt couplets, eliciting gasps of admiration from the entire gathering.

Yet his nature was aloof and unyielding, defying intimacy or estrangement. Thus, in his *Stele for the Master of Unfettered Traces*, Yan Zhenqing wrote: "He regarded court robes as straw, and cast aside desires like mud and sand. He sought the footsteps of the Daoist husband, aligning with the ancients."

Lord Li Deyu also praised him as one who, though reclusive, bore a name, and though eminent, remained unburdened—neither constrained nor exalted—comparable to Yan Guang.

Daohua, styled Zhizhang, was a native of Yongxing in Guiji. From youth, he was renowned for his literary prowess and passed the imperial examinations. Lu Xiangxian recommended him as a lecturer at the National University’s Four Gates College; he was later promoted to Erudite of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, then steadily advanced to Vice Minister of Rites. He was appointed Academician of the Jixian Institute and served as Reader-in-Waiting to the Crown Prince for thirteen years. When Emperor Xuanzong performed the Feng sacrifice at Mount Tai, Zhizhang was summoned to finalize the ritual protocols. He memorialized: "The throne of the Supreme Lord of Heaven stands as sovereign, while the seats of the Five Emperors of the Five Directions are those of ministers. Though their titles differ, their ranks as ruler and subject remain distinct. Your Majesty occupies the sovereign’s position upon the altar, while the assembled ministers offer sacrifices at the subordinate altars below—this truly sets a precedent for posterity as a great reform in ritual." He further noted: "Yet the rites conclude with the three libations, and the secondary and final offerings should be unified in one place." The emperor replied: "This is precisely what I intended; I merely sought your counsel." Thus, the three libations were performed at the altar of the Five Emperors and the seats of the various deities below.

After the ceremony, Zhizhang was promoted to Grand Master for Court Audiences, Silver and Blue Grandee, and concurrently appointed Director of the Palace Library. By nature, he was carefree and witty, admired by all the worthies of his time. In the third year of the Tianbao era, afflicted by illness, he dreamed of wandering the imperial palace. Thereupon, he submitted a memorial requesting to become a Daoist priest and return to his hometown, donating his ancestral residence to be converted into an abbey. Earlier, he had petitioned for several hundred acres of Yongzhou Lake to be designated as a release pond for living creatures; the emperor granted his request and further bestowed upon him the central bend of Jianhu Lake in Kè. The abbey was named the Abbey of a Thousand Autumns, and his son, Zeng, then Gentleman for Court Ceremonies, was appointed Vice Governor of Guiji Commandery to facilitate his father’s care. The emperor composed a poem to bid him farewell, prefaced by an edict:

*"In the third year of the Tianbao era, the Grand Master for Court Audiences, He Zhizhang, recognizing the virtue of contentment, submitted a memorial seeking retirement in his old age. He relinquished his seals of office and renounced worldly honors, aspiring to enter the Dao. Mindful of his long-held refined inclinations and advanced years, We permit him to fulfill his desire to hang up his cap and wander as a follower of Master Red Pine. On the fifth day of the first month, as he prepared to return to Mount Guiji, We held a farewell banquet for him on the eastern road, commanding the Six Ministers, the various prefects, and the Three Dukes to set up tents at the Blue Gate—a mark of honor for his journey. This is not merely to venerate virtue and respect age, but also to encourage custom and exhort the people. Let not the two Yus alone shine in the annals of Han. Thus, We compose this poem to send him on his way. All who attend this feast should compose matching verses."*

*"Renouncing glory, he seeks the Dao,
Resigning office, he removes his cap in old age.
Could We not cherish such worthies?
Yet his lofty heart will not be swayed.
Within the circle, he grasps the secret essence;
Beyond the world, he unfurls his hidden aspirations.
Only at the Blue Gate do We bid him farewell—
The assembled lords gaze after him in longing."*

From the Crown Prince downward, all attended to bid him farewell. Thereafter, he styled himself the "Madman of Siming" and also the "Outer Director of the Palace Library." In his later years, he grew ever more unrestrained, roaming the streets and alleys. When drunk, he would compose verses without pause, excelling especially in cursive and clerical scripts, ranking alongside Zhang Xu of Wu Commandery. He returned to his hometown to live out his years and died at the age of eighty-six.

In the first year of the Qianyuan era, Emperor Suzong, recalling his former service as Reader-in-Waiting, issued an edict in the eleventh month:

*"The late Daoist priest He Zhizhang of the Abbey of a Thousand Autumns in Yue Commandery possessed a temperament both serene and unassuming, a disposition harmonious and refined. His spirit was pure, his aspirations lofty; his learning was vast, his talent prodigious. He was as a fine arrow from Guiji, a precious jade from Kunlun. Thus, his name soared in the halls of immortals, and he served as lecturer in the dragon towers."*

He cultivated tranquility through silence to nurture his leisure, and through jest and humor, he offered subtle admonitions. Having resigned his official salary in his later years, he was again summoned with reverence, yet his sincere wish was to follow in the footsteps of the Two Elders, ultimately becoming the "Eccentric of Siming." Indeed, his initial resolve was to cast off his court robes, ride a black ox and never return, or befriend white gulls and wander forever. Yet the rivers and mountains are not as they once were, and both man and zither are now gone. The depth of remembrance for one so cherished calls for solemn rites; thus, in recognition of his honor and sorrow, he is posthumously awarded the title of Minister of Rites.

**Daoist Arts**

Li Bai, styled Taibai, was a native of Shandong. From youth, he possessed extraordinary talent, his aspirations vast and unrestrained, his spirit soaring with a desire to transcend the world. His father served as a commandant in Rencheng, and the family settled there. Bai, discerning in judgment, once encountered Guo Ziyi, the Prince of Fenyang, among the ranks of soldiers in Bingzhou and proclaimed him a hero. Yet his own aspirations lay in the Daoist arts, believing immortality attainable. He scorned the study of heterodox texts and disdained the compositions of Zheng and Wei, so his words often resembled the utterances of celestial immortals. Li Yangbing said of him: "Since the Three Dynasties, after the *Feng* and *Sao*, he has driven the chariots of Qu and Song, lashed the steeds of Yang and Ma—across a thousand years, he walks alone, the sole master."

In his youth, he and the Confucian scholars Kong Chaofu, Han Zhun, Pei Zheng, Zhang Shuming, and Tao Mian of Lu concealed themselves in the Zulai Mountains, drinking and singing in revelry; they were known as the "Six Eccentrics." During the Tianbao era, he sojourned in Kuaiji, where he and the Daoist Wu Yun secluded themselves in the mountains of Kè. Later, Emperor Xuanzong summoned Yun to the capital, and Yun recommended Bai to the throne. An envoy was dispatched to summon Bai for an audience. The emperor conversed with him upon a seven-jeweled couch, granted him a meal, and appointed both to the Hanlin Academy. Bai, ever fond of wine, was urgently summoned when the emperor desired new music composed, yet he was found drunk in a tavern. Brought before the throne, his face was sprinkled with water, and he was ordered to take up his brush. In an instant, he composed the three stanzas of the *Qingping Diao*, for which the emperor praised him. Once, drunk in the palace, he extended his foot to have Gao Lishi remove his boots, and for this, he was slandered and exiled. Thereafter, he roamed the rivers and lakes, drowning his days in drink. At the time, the Imperial Censor Cui Zongzhi had been demoted to Jinling, and he exchanged poems and wine with Bai. Once, on a moonlit night, he sailed from Caishi to Jinling, clad in white and wearing an imperial brocade robe in the boat, gazing about with unbridled pride, as if no one else existed. When He Zhizhang first met Bai, he exclaimed: "This is a banished immortal from heaven!" Sima Ziwei of Tiantai also remarked: "Bai possesses the bearing and bones of a transcendent; he may wander beyond the eight limits with the gods." Later, at the request of his distant uncle, Chenliu Investigating Censor Yan Yun, he sought the High Master Gao of Beihai to receive the Daoist registers at the Purple Ultimate Palace in Qizhou. He was presented with a set of azure damask robes and a cap, intending to return east to Penglai, where feathered immortals would escort him to Red Mound. The world regarded Li Bai’s essence as that of a transcendent, and he was also styled the *Perfected of the Upper Clarity, Mirror of the Untrammeled*.

**Daoist Arts**

Meng Tan, a native of Liang in Ruzhou, passed the imperial examinations. In the early Chuigong era, he was repeatedly promoted to Vice Director of the Secretariat. He was fond of esoteric arts.

When Emperor Ruizong was still a prince, Meng Tan was summoned to serve as his lecturing companion. During the Jinglong era, he was appointed Prefect of Tongzhou and granted the title of Grand Master for Splendid Happiness with Silver and Blue. At the beginning of the Shenlong era, he retired to his mountain estate in Yiyang, where he devoted himself to the preparation and consumption of medicinal elixirs. Though advanced in years, Meng Tan’s resolve and vigor only grew stronger. He once told those close to him: "One who wishes to preserve the body and nurture the nature must never let kind words leave the mouth, nor good medicine leave the hand." When Emperor Ruizong ascended the throne, he summoned Meng Tan to the capital, intending to bestow high office upon him, but Meng firmly declined on account of old age. During the Jingyun era, an imperial edict commended him with a gift of a hundred bolts of silk and ordered that, each spring and autumn, he be provided with sheep, wine, congee, and porridge. In the early Kaiyuan era, Bi Gou, the Governor of Henan, admiring Meng Tan’s ancient integrity, renamed his residence *Ziping Ward*. Meng Tan died at the age of ninety-three. He authored *Family*, *Sacrifices*, and *Rites*, each in one fascicle, as well as *Supplement to Nourishing Prescriptions* in three fascicles.

Zhang Guo’s origins are unknown. He once composed *A Profound Explication of the* *Classic of the Hidden Talisman*, exhaustively expounding its abstruse principles. Later, he was granted the title of Grand Master for Splendid Happiness with Silver and Blue and styled *Master of Penetrating the Mysteries*.

**Daoist Reclusion**

Zhu Taochui was a native of Chengdu in Yizhou. Indifferent to worldly concerns, he wore furs and lived beyond the ken of others. When Regional Inspector Dou Gui encountered him, he offered clothes, deer hides, and other gifts, and pressed him to accept the post of village head, but Zhu refused. Instead, he built a hut in the mountains, thatching it with leaves, and declined all offerings. He would weave sandals from coarse grass and leave them by the roadside, and those who saw them would say, "These are the sandals of the Recluse Zhu." When others prepared tea and left it in exchange, he would take it away, yet never engage with anyone. His sandals were finely woven, the grass supple and tightly knotted, and people competed to wear them. When Gao Shilian became Regional Inspector, he extended courteous invitations to Zhu, descending the steps to speak with him, but Zhu merely stared blankly and departed. Shilian bowed twice and said, "Has the Master of Ceremonies come to teach this official how to govern Shu without trouble?" He then streamlined regulations, reduced taxes, and the province flourished. Though Shilian repeatedly sent envoys to inquire after Zhu, whenever they approached, he would flee into the thickets and hide.

The arts of the Dao were mastered by Wang Xiyi, a native of Teng County in Xuzhou. Orphaned and impoverished, he loved the Dao. After his parents passed, he herded sheep for others to earn wages for their burial. Once the burial was complete, he withdrew into Mount Song. There, he studied under the Daoist Huang Yi for forty years, fully inheriting his techniques of breath retention and nourishing life. After Huang Yi’s death, he moved to reside in the mountains of Zulai in Yanzhou, forming a bond of reclusive companionship with the Daoist Liu Xuanbo. He was fond of the *Book of Changes* and the *Laozi*, and often consumed pine and cypress leaves along with various floral powders.

During the Jinglong era, though over seventy, his qi and strength grew ever more robust. The Prefect Lu Qiqing paid him a visit with great courtesy and inquired about the art of governing people. Xiyi replied, "Confucius said, 'What you yourself do not desire, do not impose upon others'—this may be practiced all one’s life."

When Emperor Xuanzong embarked on his eastern tour, the prefectures and counties, following ritual propriety, summoned him to the imperial presence, though he was already ninety-six. The emperor ordered the Chief Minister Zhang Yue to discuss the Dao and its principles with him. Eunuchs assisted him into the palace, and the emperor conversed with him with great delight.

In the fourteenth year of the Kaiyuan era, an edict was issued: "The hermit Wang Xiyi of Xuzhou, who abandoned worldly learning and wisdom to embrace the One and dwell in integrity, has long withdrawn from the clamor of the world, wandering alone among forests and valleys. We have ascended the sacred peaks to extend our rites, eagerly seeking the worthy, and he has come in response to our gracious summons. Though his path resembles that of the reclusive Ji of old, he has already surpassed the years of Master Fu Sheng."

It is fitting to honor him with rank to venerate the Confucian way and preserve his lofty standing by respecting his years. Let him be appointed *Chaosan Daifu* and concurrently serve as *Guozi Boshi*. He may retire and return to the mountains, and the prefectures and counties shall present him with silk, wine, and meat each spring and autumn. Moreover, grant him one set of robes and one hundred bolts of silk.

Daoist recluse Wu Youxu was the son of Wei Liang, elder brother of Empress Wu Zetian. He was indifferent to worldly desires and fond of the *Book of Changes* and the writings of Zhuang Zhou. In his youth, he changed his name and sold divinations in the markets of Chang’an, leaving behind any money he earned. Later, during the revolution, he was enfeoffed as Prince of Anping Commandery but firmly declined, expressing his wish to live in seclusion. The empress suspected deceit but permitted it to observe his conduct. Youxu built a hut beneath the cliffs, living as one who had long since withdrawn from the world. The empress sent his elder brother, Youyi, to urge him to serve, but he steadfastly refused. The empress then held him in even higher regard. He wandered between Longmen and Shaoshi, sheltering in thatched huts in winter and dwelling in stone chambers in summer. The gold, silver, and fine robes bestowed upon him, along with the deer-fur garments, plain curtains, and slender catalpas gifted by nobles, gathered dust and remained unused. In his later years, his flesh withered, and his pupils emitted a purple glow, allowing him to see the stars by day. In the eleventh year of the Kaiyuan era, he passed without illness. Amid the blazing power of the Wu clan, Youxu never once emerged, and thus he ultimately avoided their misfortune.

Daoist recluse Qin Xi, styled Gongxu, was a native of Kuaiji in Yuezhou. During the Tianbao era, he fled the chaos to Ke and later resided in Nan’an of Quanzhou for nine days. The mountain was home to over a hundred great pines, said to have been planted in the Eastern Jin. Xi built a hut beneath them, hollowed out the stone, and annotated the *Daodejing*, remaining secluded for years. Prefect Xue Bo visited him several times and presented him with sheep and wine on seasonal occasions, though Xi never once entered the city gates. Later, he crossed eastward to Moling and lived in seclusion on Mount Mao. He passed away at over eighty years of age.

The people of Nan’an longed for him and built a pavilion in his honor, naming the mountain Gaoshi Peak.

**Daoist Virtues**

Zhang Yun, styled Cangzhen, was a native of Jinyang. He resided in the mountains of Hongzhou, hence his sobriquet, Hongya Zi. Standing seven *chi* and five *cun* tall, his brows and beard were strikingly refined. Skilled in the qin and calligraphy, he excelled at the long whistle. During the Kaiyuan era, the Radiant Emperor summoned him to the Zhanlu Hall, appointing him Minister of Ceremonies. Promoted repeatedly to Minister of Works, he declined, saying: *"Why does Your Majesty begrudge a single hill or stream, denying me the chance to follow in the footsteps of Chao and You?"* Returning to the mountains, he practiced qi-absorption and grain avoidance, delighting in collecting ancient artifacts. He once rode a snow-white mule, attended by five disciples. His customary attire included a cloud-shaped bamboo hat, a hexagonal fan, a square wooden mirror, a *ruyi* of kudzu wood, and a Wei-era Hu pot. Clad in crimson robes and a woven hat, he moved among the people, who beheld him as a true divine being.

His writings include commentaries on the *Daodejing*, *Book of Changes*, *Complete Book of Rites*, and *Guliang Commentary*, as well as the *Records of Hedong* in thirty fascicles, *Grand Zhou Essays* in ten fascicles. The *Records of Yuzhang* states: *"During the Sui Kaihuang era, the title of Master of Hongzhou was bestowed, for a Daoist of ancient times had reappeared between the Sui and Tang dynasties."* According to the *True Records*, Master Hongya now serves as the Perfected One of Qingcheng, and his tomb lies in Guzang County, Wuwei. **Daoist Teachings of the Five Dynasties**

Zhang Jianming, in his youth, traveled through the He River and Northern Plains as a Confucian scholar, later departing to become a Daoist. Well-versed in the teachings of Laozi and Zhuang Zhou, he was summoned by Emperor Gaozu of Jin, who asked whether Daoist principles could govern the state. Jianming replied: *"The Dao is wondrous—it speaks through the myriad things. Those who grasp its ultimate truth may dwell in stillness upon their mats and govern all under heaven."* The emperor marveled at his words, inviting him into the inner palace to lecture on the *Daodejing* and appointing him as his master. Hearing the palace drum sound the hour, Jianming said: *"Does Your Majesty hear the drum? Its sound is but one, yet none of the five notes or twelve pitches are present in it. Yet it harmonizes all. The One is the root of all affairs; he who can hold to the One may govern the world."* The emperor praised him further and bestowed the title Master of Penetrating Mystery.

**Daoist Teachings**

Zheng Ao, styled Yunso, was a native of Huazhou. Gifted in literary composition, he sat for the imperial examinations during Emperor Zhaozong’s reign but failed. Witnessing the world’s chaos, he cast off his robes and departed, entering Mount Shaoshi to become a Daoist. Hearing that the resin of the five-needle pine on Mount Hua, buried in the earth for a thousand years, transformed into a medicine capable of expelling the Three Worms, he relocated to Huayin in search of it. He befriended the Daoists Li Daoyin and Luo Yin; Ao tilled the fields, while Yin sold medicines to sustain themselves. Daoyin possessed a fishing rod that required no bait and could transmute stone into gold. Though Ao once verified its truth, he never sought it. The world regarded them as the Three Eminent Recluses. A military commissioner, Liu Ning, sent him treasures, but he accepted nothing. Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang summoned him as *Left Remonstrating Censor*, and Emperor Gaozu of Jin as *Grand Master for Remonstrance*, but he declined both. He was granted the title Master of Carefree Wandering. He died in the fourth year of Tianfu, aged seventy-four. Ao delighted in wine, chess, and composing poetry, which he inscribed on silk. People prized these works as treasures, some even painting his likeness on their walls to venerate. Though his traces were remote, his fame only grew, unlike those such as Sun He of Stone Gate. His reclusion only magnified his renown.

**Daoist Teachings**

Wenqiu Fangyuan, styled Dafang, was a native of Susong in Shuzhou. Precocious and eloquent in his youth, he studied the *Book of Changes* under Chen Xuanwu of Mount Lu and sought its great principles from Zuo Xuanze of Xianglin, who marveled at him. Later, he dwelled in Hidden Truth Grotto on Mount Xiandu, following Liu Chujing to cultivate arts of transcendence, yet never neglected the histories and classics. He once declared: *"Ge Zhichuan and Tao Hongjing are my teachers and friends."* He distilled the *Classic of Great Peace* into thirty fascicles, exhausting its essentials. In the second year of Jingfu, Qian Liu visited him at the Great Cleansing Grotto in Yuhang, built a chamber to house him, and memorialized his conduct to the throne. Emperor Zhaozong repeatedly summoned him, but Fangyuan, divining through celestial patterns that the Qin region would soon be overgrown with thorns and the Tang Mandate nearing its end—with no recluses like Yuan and Qi emerging—declined. The court then issued an edict of praise, bestowing robes of office and the titles Master of Wondrous Being and Master of Mystic Unity. His deeds as a perfected immortal became widely known in Wu and Chu, and over two hundred disciples gathered under him. Among them, Cheng Zixiao of Guangping answered the summons to the Qin palace; Nie Shidao of Xin’an propagated his teachings in the Wu kingdom; Hu Qian’guang of Anding and Kong Zonglu of Lu attained his profoundest secrets. On the fourteenth day of the second month in the second year of Tianfu, he bathed, sat upright, and departed. He was interred at White Deer Grotto in the Great Cleansing, and King Wusu of Qian dreamed of riding a crane to bid him farewell.

**Daoist Teachings**

Nie Shidao, styled Zongwei, was a native of She in Xin’an. Naturally intelligent and sincere, his words and deeds were modest and reverent, and he was known for filial devotion in caring for his parents. He studied under Wenqiu Dafang and built Wenzheng Hermitage on the eastern mountain of his prefecture.

Once, perusing the *Inner Transmission*, he chanced upon the method of ingesting pine resin. Entering the Hundred-Fathom Mountain to gather it, he encountered the Perfected Cai and his son, as well as the Perfected Peng. What should have been a day and night in the mountains stretched to over a month in the world of mortals. He marveled that such an encounter was ordained by fate, and sighed deeply in wonder.

Whenever he gathered firewood or medicinal herbs in the forest, tigers and leopards trailed behind him, sometimes carrying the wood or herbs upon their backs to deliver them home before departing. In the mountains near She, beasts no longer harmed humans—all moved by the virtue of Master Nie.

His mother, inquiring about the fruits of his travels and studies, heard the full account and rejoiced, saying: *"You nourish me with filial devotion and enrich me with the Dao. How fortunate I am to be your mother! This must be the blessing of our past lives."*

He journeyed to the Southern Marchmount and the Nine Doubts, seeking the Perfected Mei and Attendant Gentleman Xiao at Jade Bamboo Peak. Mei was none other than Fu, the magistrate of Nanchang, while Xiao was Ziyun, styled Jingqiao, a prince of the Liang. Having fled the chaos of Hou Jing’s rebellion as governor of Dongyang, they took refuge in these mountains with their families, and both attained the Dao there.

One day, wandering in Yu Mu Hollow, he met Xie Tongxiu, who declared himself a native of the Southern Marchmount and a fellow recluse with Peng and Cai. Xie led him to his dwelling and bestowed upon him a copy of the *Plain Book*. Nie then returned to Wenzheng Hermitage, where for over thirty years, whenever he performed his rites, he venerated the true forms of Peng, Cai, and Xie.

When the Great Emperor of Wu seized control of the Jiang and Huai regions, he heard of Nie’s renown and summoned him to Guangling. There, he built the Palace of Primordial Darkness as his residence and bestowed upon him the title *"Master of Carefree Wandering, Instructor of Wenzheng."* Nie dwelled in Guangling for another thirty years, gathering over five hundred disciples.

Later, he withdrew and departed in transcendence, leaving the world in longing remembrance. Yet clouds and cranes were repeatedly sighted above Wenzheng Mountain, and the people of She—his hometown and kin—believed he had returned, like the legendary Lingwei revisiting the carved pillar.

An imperial edict was issued in praise and posthumous honor, proclaiming:
*"Inquiry into the precedents of posthumous ennoblement reveals this as an enduring statute. Yet how could such a cause go unrecognized? Thus, throughout the Huai, Zhe, Xuan, and She regions, the dignity of the Daoist clergy shall be upheld. The Master of Carefree Wandering, Instructor of Wenzheng, who served the state with his rites, is granted the title of Grand Virtue and the Purple Robe."*

Nie Shidao had early mastered the profound principles of the Dao and long aligned with the true wind. Like a wild crane, he stood apart from the flock; like a solitary cloud, he drifted at ease. In the days when the founding ancestor laid the dynasty’s foundations, he was already commissioned to perform the rites. When the meritorious ministers first stabilized the realm, he had long been revered in their esteem. His pure cultivation truly crowned the gates of the mysterious. Though he ascended beyond the world, time and again, his legacy only grew in splendor across the land.

Moreover, as the Daoist clergy petitioned the throne and the chief ministers submitted their memorials—preparing to open the sacred precincts and return him to his homeland—it was fitting to elevate his rank and confer upon him a lofty title, that his virtuous deeds might be eternally commemorated. Thus, he is posthumously granted the title of *"Grand Master for Glorious Happiness, Minister of the Court of State Ceremonial, Instructor of Wenzheng."*

**Song of Daoist Virtue**

Chen Tuan,¹ styled Tunan, was a native of Qiao Commandery. In his youth, while playing by the eddying waters, a blue-clad crone cradled him and nursed him, saying: *"May you be forever free from craving and desire, and surpass all others in wisdom."*

During the Changxing era of the Tang, he sat for the imperial examinations but failed to pass. He then withdrew to Mount Wudang, where he practiced grain avoidance and refined his qi. He composed eighty-one poems, titled *The Pointer to the Mysterious*. Later, Emperor Mingzong of the Later Tang enfeoffed him as the *Recluse of Pure Emptiness*. Soon after, he moved to Cloud Terrace Abbey on Mount Hua, where he often shut his door and remained secluded for months on end.

Emperor Shizong of the Zhou summoned him to the palace, and upon verification, his abilities proved true. At the end of the Xiande era, he rode a white mule toward the Eastern Capital. Upon hearing that Emperor Taizu of the Song had ascended the throne, he laughed loudly and said: *"The realm is settled at last!"*

During the reign of Emperor Taizong, he was summoned again. Tunan submitted a memorial in refusal, stating: *"Your servant’s nature is like that of apes and crows; my heart is as dead ashes. I comprehend neither the depths of benevolence and righteousness nor the propriety of ritual decorum. I fashion my robes from withered lotus leaves and shape my cap from a cast-off clog. My body bears blue fur, and my feet go bare of straw sandals."*

---
¹ *Variant character: 搏 or 博*

Should he approach the imperial throne, he would only bring ridicule upon sagely wisdom. Emperor Taizong dispatched an emissary once more, insisting he rise, and bestowed upon him a poem:

*Once you emerged from white clouds of former courts,*
*Yet later tidings faded into silent naught.*
*If now you heed the summons you have spurned,*
*I’d yield to you the Three Peaks in their height.*

Unable to refuse, Tunan presented himself at court. He wore a Huayang cap, straw sandals upon his feet, and a feathered robe with hanging sash. Received with the rites due a guest, he was granted the title *Master of Rare Serenity*. The emperor sent him to the Hall of the Secretariat, where he addressed the chief ministers Song Qi and others: *"Bo has cultivated himself in solitude, untouched by power or gain. He entered Mount Hua forty years ago and now nears a century in age. With the realm at peace, he has come to pay homage—this is worthy of consideration."*

Song Qi and the others inquired about the Way of self-cultivation. He replied: *"His Majesty bears the celestial countenance of sun and moon, rightly ordering ruler and minister. In this era of harmonious virtue and governance, what practice could surpass diligent cultivation?"*

Scholars and officials daily sought his wisdom. To all he answered: *"Where you wander at ease, linger not too long. Where you have found success, return no more."* Those of discernment inscribed these words.

Tunan was deeply versed in the classics, particularly the *Book of Changes*. He transmitted his learning to his disciple Mu Xiu, who passed it to Li Zhicai, who in turn taught Master Kangjie Shao Yong. He also entrusted the *Taiji Diagram* to Zhong Fang, who conveyed it to Mu Xiu, who then transmitted it to Master Lianxi Zhou Maoshu.

Thus, Tunan often revealed insights before their causes became clear, and the world came to believe in his discernment of human character. When Emperor Taizu was still in obscurity, Tunan encountered him and Minister Zhao Zhongxian strolling through the markets of Chang’an. *"Might we share a drink?"* he asked. The future emperor replied: *"I would gladly join Master Zhao."* Tunan glanced at them and said: *"That will suffice."* At the tavern, Zhongxian, suffering from a lame foot, hastened to take the seat of honor. Tunan rebuked him: *"A minor star of the Purple Tenuity—how dare you claim precedence?"* And he pulled him down. Later, Emperor Taizong ordered him to visit Prince Shou. Tunan reached the prince’s gate but turned back, saying: *"The prince’s attendants are all future ministers and generals—why need I see the prince himself?"* From that moment, Taizong’s favor inclined toward the future Emperor Zhenzong.

In the second year of the *Duan’gong* era, foreseeing his end, he submitted a memorial: *"The great reckoning draws to a close; the sagely age is not to be clung to."* He instructed his disciple Jia Desheng to carve a stone chamber at Zhangchao Valley. Upon its completion, he passed away. For a full month, five-colored clouds veiled the mountain valley, dispersing not at all.

The Daoist scholar Wang Zhaosou was a native of Suanzao.

From an early age, he studied the Dao and was particularly profound in the *Book of Changes*. He once remarked: *"The Kun hexagram governs the tenth month, when pure yin prevails, yet yang qi still lingers within. Thus, even as Master Jimao reaches the end of the Kun hexagram, the image of 'dragons battling' remains—dragons being yang. This shows that yang can never be entirely exhausted. For yin and yang alternate in their use of hardness and softness, their transformations ever renewing, the source of ceaseless generation."*

His understanding of the Dao ran deep. The villagers revered his conduct, and when disputes arose, they did not take them to the authorities but came solely to seek his judgment.

In the second year of the *Kaibao* era, he was summoned to lecture on the *Book of Changes*. The following year, he requested to return home. The emperor specially appointed him as Erudite of the National University and saw him off with full ceremonial honors, though by then he was already in his dotage. He lived to over ninety before passing away, his head retracting into his abdomen—a phenomenon said to be "tortoise breathing."

Daoist Cheng Yin, styled Qizhen, was a native of Changshan. Well-versed in both inner and outer learning, when Emperor Taizu returned from his campaign against Taiyuan, he visited Cheng’s residence. At the time, Qizhen was eighty years old, yet his complexion remained youthful. When the emperor inquired about his methods of nourishing life, he replied: *"Your servant’s way of nourishing life lies in focused contemplation and refining qi. But for emperors and kings, the approach differs. As the *Laozi* says: 'If I practice non-action, the people transform themselves; if I remain still, the people rectify themselves.' Without action, without desire, the spirit congeals in supreme harmony. The Yellow Emperor and Emperor Yao enjoyed long reigns by attaining this Dao."* The emperor was greatly pleased.

Shall he not be counted among the likes of Sun Simiao?

**Daoist Accounts**

Zhang Wumeng, styled Lingyin, was a native of Zhengwu in Fengxiang. He shared bonds of transcendental friendship with Zhong Fang and Liu Haichan. Wandering to Tiantai and Chicheng, he dwelt in a hut on Qiong Terrace. He once declared: *"One is the function of the Dao; its essence lies in being without direction, without form, without function, without action—yet in non-action, nothing remains undone. All creatures, from the flying to the creeping, partake of the Dao-nature. Those who attain the Dao know no limit to transformation: in small measure, a dung-beetle becomes a cicada; in great, a man may become an immortal."* Thereupon, observing the transformations of heaven and earth, the flourishing and decay of grasses and trees, the unfurling and rolling of wind and clouds, the revolving of sun and moon, the clashing of water and fire, and the interplay of yin and yang, he composed the *Hundred Chapters on Returning to the Origin*.

Emperor Zhenzong summoned him for an audience and inquired into the principles of longevity and enduring vision. Wumeng replied: *"Your servant dwells in the mountains, reciting only the *Book of Changes* and the *Laozi*, knowing nothing beyond."* When commanded to expound the *Changes*, he discoursed on the Hexagram of Humility. The emperor asked: *"Why speak only of Humility?"* He answered: *"At a time when great abundance is at hand, it is fitting to hold fast to humility."* The emperor deeply assented. Again, he was ordered to lecture on the *Returning to the Origin*, whereupon he said: *"The state is like the heart: when the heart is without action, qi harmonizes, and when qi harmonizes, the myriad treasures coalesce. When the heart acts, qi scatters, and when qi scatters, the essence of things dissipates. This is the great outline of returning to the source."* Zhenzong marveled at his words and bestowed upon him the rank of Gentleman for Literary Composition, but he declined and insisted on returning to the mountains. Later, he died in Jinling at the age of ninety-nine. Bixuzi Chen Jingyuan was his disciple.

**Daoist Accounts**

Liu Lie, a native of Jiujiang, was drawn to the Dao from childhood. He encountered an extraordinary person and, during the Jianlong era, attained the Dao. He built a hut on Mount Lu and secretly cultivated his Way, styling himself Master Empty Valley. There was once a certain Tan Jingsheng who composed the *Book of Transformations*; Lie distilled its essence, saying: *"The Great Void, though boundless, has its limits; the Supreme, though vast, has its abode. To grasp the gate of qi is to gather its root; to know the vessel of the primordial spirit is to conceal its radiance. Like the oyster that guards within or the stone that harbors within, what is stored is the primordial essence, what is employed is the myriad numina, what is contained is the Great One, and what is released is the Great Clarity."* In general, he took the teachings of the *Yellow Court* from the Lacquer Garden of the Pillared Hall as his foundation. He often taught that those who study the Dao must not let the myriad things alter their nature, but keep the mind profoundly still and free of thought. When one guides the qi at the proper time, the hundred bones all find ease. Embracing purity and nurturing the Great Mystery, one avoids falling into the snares of mechanism. Then one knows where the spirit abides, whence qi arises, and where essence returns—what course could fail to reach its destination?

**Daoist Accounts**

Zhang Ganyao was the twenty-fourth-generation descendant of the Han Celestial Master. In the eighth year of Tiansheng, he was summoned to the imperial court. Emperor Renzong questioned him about the matter of ascending to heaven in broad daylight. He replied: *"This is not a means to assist governance and teaching. If Your Majesty could return to the simplicity of antiquity, govern with ease, and maintain a mind as clear as still waters, then spirit and qi would be whole and harmonious—why seek ascent to heaven?"* The emperor approved and bestowed upon him the title Master of Clarity and Simplicity.

Fu Lin, a native of Qingzhou, was a fellow student of Zhang Yong, Duke of Loyalty and Integrity, in their youth. After the Duke rose to prominence, he sought Fu for thirty years without success. Once, moved by longing for his old friend, he composed a poem to express his sentiment. In his later years, while governing Wanqiu, a man clad in coarse cloth, riding a donkey, knocked at the gate of the government office and shouted: *"Tell the Minister that Fu Lin of Qingzhou has come."* The clerks rushed to report his words, but the Duke, enraged, said: *"Master Fu is a renowned scholar of the realm—how dare you address him so disrespectfully by name?"* Fu Lin laughed and replied: *"We have been apart for a lifetime, yet you still cling to childish notions. How could you understand that the world has its own way of being?"* The Duke asked: *"Why did you remain hidden in the past but emerge now?"* Fu Lin answered: *"You are about to depart this life, and I have come to bid you farewell."* The Duke said: *"I, too, have sensed this."* Fu Lin replied: *"If you know, what more is there to say?"* Then he took his leave, revealing nothing of his destination. A month later, the Duke passed away.

Dao Mo, whose courtesy name was Zilian, was a farmer from Mount Heng. Simple and unrefined, the people called him *"Crude Ox."* In his later years, he entered the Southern Marchmount Abbey and became a Daoist. Seven *li* southwest of the abbey stood the Purple Void Pavilion, the former altar of Lady Wei of the Wei dynasty. As the site had fallen into desolation, no Daoist was willing to reside there—only Zilian delighted in its solitude, sitting in silent stillness. No one witnessed his practices, though he was fond of wine and often wandered drunk among the mountains and forests, oblivious even to fierce storms. Tigers and wolves passed before him without harm. When the Vice Minister of Rites, Wang Ku, was appointed governor of Changsha, he received an imperial decree to offer prayers at the altar of Lady Wei on Mount Heng. Zilian, then drunk outside, could not rise. He fixed his gaze upon the minister and said: *"This rustic Daoist loves wine but cannot always obtain it—when he does, he drinks to excess. Does the official take offense?"* Sensing his extraordinary nature, Wang Ku took him back, but after a month, Zilian remained silent and aloof. Wang then returned him to the mountain, saying: *"The Master’s inner radiance is veiled in stillness—beyond the grasp of this old man."* He intended to compose a poem in his honor but soon forgot. One day, while napping, he dreamed of Zilian coming to demand the poem. He then wrote two quatrains, inscribed them on a tablet, and placed it in the pavilion. The other Daoists marveled: *"How did Crude Ox deserve this?"*

On the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month in the fifth year of Taiping Xingguo, Zilian suddenly told those in the abbey: *"I am about to depart. The pavilion must not be left unattended—quickly find someone to succeed me."* The others, astonished, said: *"In this scorching heat, where could Crude Ox be going?"* When they rushed to look, he had already died. Only then did they exclaim in awe: *"Could Crude Ox have known his own death day?"* He was buried at the foot of the mountain. Shortly after, the monk Shoucheng of Nantai Temple returned from the eastern capital. Outside the Nanxun Gate, he encountered Zilian, his spirit bright and bearing uplifted. Shoucheng asked why he had left the mountain, and Zilian smiled: *"Merely wandering at leisure. Deliver this letter to those in the abbey."* When Shoucheng returned, he learned of Zilian’s death and verified the letter’s date—it matched the day of his passing. When they opened his tomb, only his staff and sandals remained.

Zhao Ji, a native of Daizhou, had attained the Dao. He wandered as a beggar through Gao’an City, deliberately appearing unclean. In the third year of the Yuanfeng era, Su Zhe (zi You) was demoted to Gao’an. Zhao unexpectedly visited him and said: *"I know you cherish the Dao but have not yet grasped its essence. Your yang does not descend, nor does your yin ascend. Your flesh is excessive and buoyant; your face is flushed and prone to sores. I teach you to draw water and bathe your hundred bones for a full day—all ailments will vanish. If you persist without cease, you may transcend the world."* Su Zhe tested his words and found them true. Another day, he asked about nurturing one’s nature. Zhao replied: *"Have you ever dreamed? While dreaming, do you retain awareness of life and death, sorrow and joy?"* Su Zhe answered: *"Yes, but it cannot last."* Zhao smiled: *"If there is a difference between dreaming and waking, your nature is not whole."* Su Zhe was deeply struck and convinced he was a true adept of the Dao.

Zhao himself once said that while in Guangling, he was poisoned by a fellow student named Jiang. His eyes became clouded, yet at times he could shed the film and see a boy with bright, piercing blue-green pupils. The bones above his navel resembled a tortoise’s shell, while those below his heart were sharp as blades. Where the two met, they did not align, leaving a gap like a finger’s width. At that time, he was already one hundred twenty-seven years old.

Later, when Zhao reached Xingguo Prefecture, Prefect Yang Huisu detained him, but before long, Zhao was kicked to death by a mule the prefect kept. Yang buried him.

In the first year of the Yuanyou era, the Shu monk Fazhen came to see Master Su Shi in the eastern capital and said: *"When I reached a wineshop in Yun’an, I met a beggar who said, ‘My surname is Zhao. I once knew Master Su. When you return to Huangzhou, please send him my regards.’"*

Su Zhe heard this and, astonished, asked about the beggar’s appearance. He knew it was Zhao.

At the time, Zhu Yanbo’s son, who was serving as Prefect of Xingguo Prefecture, was present. He returned home and told his father, who opened Zhao’s burial site. Inside, only a staff and two scriptures remained.

Daoist texts speak of the lowest grade of *shijie* (corpse-liberation), where a single bone is left behind—could this be what was meant?

The Daoist Li Hao was a native of Jianzhou. Skilled in talismanic incantations, he was summoned by Chen Shugu, who governed Chenzhou, after the official residence became plagued by ghosts. Once Li Hao was installed in the empty hall, the hauntings ceased.

Su Zhe asked: *"How were you able to do this?"*
Li replied: *"Those men are ruled by desire, so ghosts mock them. I have long severed desire—there is nothing more to it."*

When asked about the principles of nurturing life, he answered: *"Humans are endowed with the Five Phases of Heaven and Earth at birth, sharing in their cyclical movements. Heaven and Earth are inexhaustible, yet human life rarely exceeds a hundred years—this is self-destruction. From birth, one knows the distinction between self and other, what lies within as ‘me’ and what lies without as ‘things.’ If the feelings of self and other are not forgotten, the self and things remain divided, and the qi of the Five Phases one receives becomes distinct. Cut off from the great unity of the Five Phases, one exhausts the measure of one’s endowment—hence some live long, others die young. But if one truly forgets the difference between self and other, making the body one with Heaven and Earth, then the qi of the Five Phases flows ceaselessly within and without. How could one not attain longevity?"*

The Daoist Zhu Ziying, styled Yinzhi, was a native of Zhuyang Village in Juqu.

Born in the first year of the Taiping Xingguo era (976 CE). At eight or nine, while herding with the village boy Guo Gancun, he could play the flute to summon cranes. His parents deemed this inauspicious and abandoned him. He then took Daoist robes under Zhu Yuanji of Mount Mao at the age of twelve, during the early Duan’gong reign (988 CE). Later, he resided with the Perfected Zhang, Mistress of Luminous Truth, atop Mount Jijin, where he tested the arts of grain avoidance. As people began to flock to him, he resolved to wander far.

Arriving in Xiangyang, he encountered the extraordinary figure Chen Tiejao, who took him to Mount Qingcheng. Passing through Laixiang, he examined the ancient scriptures of the Taiqing Palace in Xiaowei. There, he met the Water Star Lad, Wu Xian, whose childhood name was Baoyi. Baoyi took him to Hezhong Prefecture, declaring that this journey had reached the Great Yin’s alchemy of bodily refinement, where a single pause in movement would transform the spirit.

In the first year of Jingde (1004 CE), he succeeded as the twenty-third lineage holder of the Mao Mountain scriptural register. Emperor Zhenzong dispatched envoys to pray for an heir in the mountains, and the following year, Emperor Renzong was born—a matter recorded in *The History of the Song*. By imperial decree, he was appointed abbot of the Jade Purity Luminous Response Palace, vigorously establishing the Qian Yuan and Tian Sheng Observatories. He was bestowed the title "National Master." Empress Dowager Mingsu transmitted to him the *Great Cavern* and *Complete Methods*, further honoring him as "Master of Mystic Observation."

Upon returning to the mountain, he received a letter sent from Shu by Baoyi, whose words admonished him for flaunting his name and fame, thus exposing the celestial mechanisms. Facing it, the Master wept streams of tears, leaving his disciples bewildered.

In the eleventh month of the seventh year of Tiansheng (1029 CE), he sat in transformation at Qian Yuan Observatory, clutching the jade ruyi scepter bestowed by the Xiangfu era. Sweat drenched his body, and pearls of condensation formed upon his brow—an exalted case of liberation through the corpse.

**Daoist Lineage Record**
Liu Hun Kang, styled Hunkang, native of Jinling.

In the fifth year of Jiayou (1060 CE), he tested into the Daoist register and became a Daoist. One evening, he dreamed of a divine person who told him: "If you wish to study the Dao, you must choose a renowned mountain." He had long lamented the absence of worthy masters in the world, so he would often let his hair down and ascend the altar, taking Heaven as his宗. Later, hearing that Master Mao of Mount Mao was accomplished in the Dao, he visited him once and was transmitted scriptures and registers. He built a hut at Accumulated Gold Peak, where one day three feathered transcendents arrived at his dwelling. Pointing to the eastern corner of his hut, they said: "You shall dwell here, embracing the spirit and guarding the center. Let your virtue and kindness extend to others, and you will be without shame before the ancients." They then looked at his forehead and said: "This is the ground of non-action, the esteemed place of the Dao, which must not bear blemish." They touched it with their hands, and by the next day, the scar had vanished.

In the first year of Yuanyou (1086 CE), Emperor Zhezong, having heard of his reputation, summoned him as a perfected Daoist and appointed him to reside at the Upper Clarity Repository of Auspiciousness. In the fourth year of Shaosheng (1097 CE), he petitioned the Jiangning Prefecture to convert his dwelling, the Hermitage of Reclusive Spirit, into Yuanfu Abbey, and separately established the Three Mao Mountains as the ancestral altar, together with Dragon-Tiger Mountain in Xinzhou and Mount Hezao in Linjiang Prefecture, forming the Three Mountains of Scriptures and Registers.

Emperor Huizong greatly expanded the abbey, renaming it Yuanfu Myriad Tranquility Palace, and bestowed upon him the jade seal of the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital, a jade couch, a *jingzhen* sword, imperial calligraphy, paintings, and treasures—gifts beyond enumeration. Though he repeatedly memorialized on disasters and omens, the emperor only sighed in response and could not heed his words.

In the second year of Daguan (1108 CE), he was summoned from the mountain again. A herd of deer blocked the road, and one struck the carriage and died. He ordered it placed by the roadside. Earlier, the cranes he had raised flew away upon hearing of his summons. The Master said: "The cranes have departed, and the deer has perished—my return is no longer fated." Arriving in the capital in the fourth month, he was lodged in the newly constructed detached abbey of Yuanfu. That night, he dreamed of the Heavenly Thearch summoning him for discourse. At dawn, the imperial carriage arrived, and he presented the *Great Cavern Scripture* he had been reciting.

On the seventeenth day, *dingyou* (a day in the sexagenary cycle), he suddenly underwent transformation at the age of seventy-two. A Repository of Concealed Perfection was constructed at his burial site, and he was posthumously honored as Master of Wondrous Tranquility and Harmony at the Preserved Perfection Abbey. He was further enfeoffed as Grand Master for Court Consultation and granted the title "Serene Unity."

**Daoist Lineage Record**
Zha Zhengzhi, styled Qingyuan, native of Jinling.

His father brought him to Mount Mao, where Master Liu saw him and marveled, saying, "This child shall one day be a master of both humans and heavens." Overjoyed, the boy vowed never to return home and became Master Liu’s closed-door disciple. During the Yuanyou era, he followed Master Liu to court. When the imperial decree ordered Master Liu to reside at the Chuxiang Abbey, he entrusted the young disciple with the affairs of the Yuanfu Abbey.

On the third day of the seventh month in the third year of the Zhenghe era, at the age of forty-six, he summoned his disciples and said, "This year, I turn forty-six. Long ago, my late master foretold that, though I have been undeservedly favored by the court’s great kindness, my lifespan would not exceed this age." He then ordered the drafting of his posthumous memorial. Taking up the brush himself, he inscribed at its end:

*"Your Majesty is divinely endowed with sagacity and wisdom, honoring the Dao and exalting virtue. No emperor since ancient times has surpassed you. Yet I must remind you: the way an emperor serves the Dao differs from that of common subjects. Each word and deed must align with the celestial will, that all under heaven may receive your grace. The* Five Thousand Characters of the Supreme *teaches that abandoning extravagance and excess, and prizing compassion and frugality, is the treasure of Your Majesty’s teachers and the bridge to attaining the Dao. I humbly beseech Your Majesty to purify your heart and reduce desires to preserve your sacred person, to moderate expenditures and practice thrift to secure the state’s foundation, and to heed loyal counsel to broaden the path of remonstrance. Thus shall the realm be most fortunate.*

*Though I, your lowly servant, am unworthy to risk death by submitting these words, I am bound by the weight of my late master’s trust, who once charged me to place loyalty to the state above all else. At this critical juncture, to withhold even a single word that might aid your sagely virtue would be to betray heaven and fail my master, leaving me with eternal regret in the netherworld."*

Having sealed the memorial, he passed away. When Emperor Huizong received it, he sighed in grief without end. The memorial was sent to the Repository of Concealed Perfection and engraved upon stone in the mountains.

**Daoist Lineage Record**
Xu Shouxin, native of Hailing.

Xu Shouxin worked as a menial laborer at the Temple of Celestial Celebration, clad in tattered hempen robes and dragging frayed straw sandals, sometimes crawling on hands and knees. Throughout the day, he did nothing but sweep and recite the *Scripture of Salvation for Humanity* without cease. A Daoist named Xu Yuanji arrived from elsewhere, afflicted with severe leprosy. The others loathed and shunned him, refusing to share quarters, and banished him to a thatched hut behind the temple. Shouxin alone served him with utmost care. After Yuanji died, Shouxin begged for money to bury him. Having done so, he returned to the thatched hut and wept for three days before emerging, feigning madness. Gradually, strange occurrences arose, and people revered him as divine, calling him the Divine Elder. Only then did they realize he had attained the Dao from the leprous Daoist.

Thereafter, many came from all directions to inquire about fortune and misfortune. When Emperor Zhezong fell ill, incense was sent to the Divine Elder’s abode, and he inscribed an auspicious message to present to the throne. Soon after, Emperor Huizong ascended the throne. In the early Chongning era, Shouxin was summoned but refused to rise. Forcibly carried to the Eastern Capital, he still would not stay. The court then reverently sent him home, and in Hailing, the Xianyuan Wanshou Palace was built for his residence. In the second year of the Daguan era, he was summoned to the capital. On the seventeenth day of the fourth month, he heard that Master Liu of Maoshan had departed at the detached abode of Chuxiang. He declared, “Master Liu has gone; I too shall go.” On the twentieth day, the gengzi day, he shed his mortal form.

Thus, an imperial edict proclaimed: *“Sincere intent moved the unseen, and a transcendent arrived without warning. Clearly relinquishing transformation, they departed in unspoken accord.”* He was posthumously enfeoffed as Grand Master of Palace Leisure, with a eulogy no different from that of Master Liu.

**Daoist Lineage Record**
Zhang Jixian, thirty-first-generation descendant of the Han Celestial Master. At nine, he inherited the lineage’s teachings. Profoundly silent and sparing of words, he was pale and slender, with refined features—a true celestial being. Emperor Huizong dispatched envoys to summon him. Upon arrival, he was appointed Grand Master of Azure Emptiness, but at thirteen, he declined the title. In the fourth year of the Chongning era, he was summoned again and tasked with resolving the strange events at the Xiezhou salt marshes. His divine efficacy was extraordinary, and he was bestowed the title Master of Tranquil Emptiness. During the Zhenghe era, when the imperial palace suffered calamity, he was ordered to perform rites of exorcism. He memorialized the impending crisis of the “Red Ram and Scarlet Horse,” his words veiled in secrecy.

At the onset of the Jingkang era, as the barbarians withdrew beyond the frontier, the court again dispatched envoys, along with the prefect, to his hermitage, insisting he rise and come. Traveling to Yuhang, his countenance grew somber and disquieted, though none could fathom why. Soon after, news arrived that the barbarians had renewed their invasion. Urgently summoned to court, he reached the Tianqing Temple in Sizhou, sat upright, and departed this world at thirty-six, in the dingwei year. Later, the monk Sa Shoujian encountered him again on Mount Qingcheng. Emperor Gaozong ordered his portrait installed in the Inner Palace Hall, and his writings, the *Song of the Great Dao* and *On the Heart*, were transmitted to the world.

**Daoist Teachings**
Liu Gaoshang, native of Anding in Binzhou.

The Liu family had long tilled the soil. At nine, he refused to eat meat. Later, he gradually fell silent, answering questions only in writing. His words at first seemed unintelligible, yet soon proved prophetic. His family built a separate chamber for him, and in time, his every utterance resonated with uncanny accuracy. Near and far, people revered him as divine. Emperor Huizong thrice dispatched envoys to summon him, but he declined on grounds of illness, refusing the imperial decree. The emperor bestowed upon him the title *Gaoshang Recluse* and had a Daoist abbey constructed for his residence, where his disciples named it after his title. During the Jingkang turmoil, when the barbarians beheld *Gaoshang*, they dismounted and prostrated themselves, daring not enter his village.

He once declared: "Men of this world destroy themselves through craving, annihilate their descendants through wealth, slaughter others through governance, and ruin the realm through misguided learning." Later generations recognized these as words of profound wisdom. Zhou Shaoyin wrote his biography and expanded upon his teachings, asserting that these were the discourses of an ancient, all-embracing Perfected One—arguments to rescue the drowning, revive the dead, and restore truth. How could mere scholars of rhetoric or literature ever attain such depth? Though born a farmer’s son, never having studied under a master, he spoke thus—was he not one of those deeply attuned to the Dao among the immortals? Indeed, he stood apart from those who merely practiced bear-like postures or crane-like stretches, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, accumulating years of trivial effort in hopes of inscribing their names in the registers of immortality.

**Daoist Teachings**
Wang Daojian, a Daoist of Mount Longhu.
During the Zhenghe era, he was summoned to court and lodged in the Taiyi Palace. Emperor Huizong inquired about the arts of cultivation and longevity. He replied: "Through purity and non-action, the Yellow Emperor and Laozi achieved governance. Through excessive desire, Emperor Wu of Han sought immortality in vain. Cultivation is not the business of the Son of Heaven." At the time, the emperor was overseeing the collation of the *Daoist Canon*. Wang was appointed Grand Master of the Grand White and tasked with collating scriptures in the Ning Shen Hall alongside other editors.

Emperor Huizong, foreseeing national calamity, ordered Wang to perform rituals of exorcism. Wang replied: "Virtue can turn back Heaven’s decree; mere rituals of exorcism dare not mislead the state." He insisted on returning to his mountain. In the early Shaoxing era, Emperor Gaozong again dispatched envoys to summon him. The day before their arrival, Wang struck the drum, gathered his disciples, and chanted: "To report to Chang’an, the envoy should seek no more on the seas or mountains." By the time the envoys arrived, he had already departed this world.

**Daoist Arts**
Liu Yongguang, a native of Guixi in Xinzhou.

Liu Yongguang’s appearance was strikingly archaic and swarthy; in his prime, he gained no renown. He once traveled to Mount Heng, and on the way to Linchuan County in Fuzhou, he encountered a Daoist on the road who called himself Zhang Fuyuan. Liu accompanied him, carrying Zhang’s belongings and cooking for him. When they reached Changsha, Zhang said to him: "You have served me with utmost diligence. At first, I treated you lightly, but observing your conduct, you have only grown more respectful toward me. Now that I am entering Shu, I have a text to bestow upon you—guard it well." He then departed. Liu opened the scroll to find the *Book of the Five Thunders*.

During the Qingyuan era, Quzhou suffered a drought. The prefect, Shen Zuoli, dreamed of a black dragon coiled at the gate of the City God’s temple. Upon inspection the next day, he found Liu Yongguang drunk outside. The prefect immediately invited him to perform a prayer for rain, and rain fell. The prefect reported the matter to the court, and when Liu was summoned to pray for rain before the emperor, rain again followed. Though Liu was nearly forty, he had not yet been ordained as a Daoist priest. At this time, he was granted a cap and robe in the imperial presence and bestowed the title Master of Tranquil Purity. Emperor Ningzong allocated funds from the privy purse to demolish and expand the Shangqing Palace. When Emperor Lizong ascended the throne, Liu was summoned once more. He told the envoy: "Report to the Son of Heaven that to govern the realm, the *Five Thousand Characters of the Dao and Virtue* suffice. What use is a rustic from the mountains and forests?" He ultimately transformed and departed in the mountains of Longhu.

The Zhang Fuyuan Liu had encountered was said by some to have been the Han Celestial Master. **End of Scroll Five of the *Records of the Mysterious Ranks*.**
